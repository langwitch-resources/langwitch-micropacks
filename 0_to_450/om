You never knew if you’d see them again.	Ammas isaan arguu fi dhiisuu kee gonkumaa hin beekne.
Not more than he did.	Kan inni godhe caalaa miti.
They may stay for a while, they may quit.	Yeroo muraasaaf turuu danda'u, dhiisuu danda'u.
A month and no more.	Ji'a tokko malee kana caalaa hin jiru.
Names and comments are required.	Maqaa fi yaada kennuu barbaachisa.
It's just a question.	Gaaffii qofa.
He can do it completely.	Guutummaatti ni danda'a.
I think tonight is one of them.	Halkan kun isaan keessaa tokko natti fakkaata.
That she doesn't know you.	Akka isheen si hin beekne.
It didn’t look like an accident.	Balaa hin fakkaatu ture.
Hopefully it’s not a big deal.	Dhimma guddaa akka hin taane abdii qabna.
I am not the person you think I am.	Ani nama ati yaaddu miti.
Just another morning.	Ganama biraa qofa.
Which you didn’t do.	Kan ati hin goone.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
I want to do this as much as she does.	Anis hamma isheen gootu kana gochuu barbaada.
I didn't want that to be an excuse for him.	Sun isaaf sababa akka ta'u hin barbaanne.
Only his hands.	Harka isaa qofa.
I don’t want to see what’s going on now.	Amma maaltu akka jiru arguu hin barbaadu.
She had no idea where it was.	Eessa akka ta'e yaada hin qabdu turte.
He thought only of himself.	Of qofa yaade.
Two months ago he asked for her hand.	Ji'a lama dura harka ishee gaafate.
He bought a new set of clothes.	Uffata haaraa hojjechuuf oolu bite.
It doesn't have to be long.	Dheeraa ta'uu hin qabu.
She was always in a good mood.	Yeroo hundumaa miira gaarii keessa turte.
None of them are right.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee sirrii miti.
It won’t go away for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin deemu.
But if everything went well .	Garuu osoo wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deeme .
It was the answer.	Deebii ture.
I haven’t seen him in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isa hin argine.
I don't think so.	Natti hin fakkaatu.
After a while he looked up.	Yeroo muraasa booda ol jedhee ilaale.
It's almost there now.	Amma achitti jechuun ni danda'ama.
She is a celebrity.	Isheen nama beekamaadha.
But nothing came of it.	Garuu wanti itti dhufe hin jiru.
But that was a good picture.	Garuu sun suuraa gaarii ture.
No one had any money.	Namni qarshii tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Not even me.	Ani iyyuu miti.
But it doesn’t seem like that.	Garuu akkas hin fakkaatu.
It was a morning like this.	Ganama akka kanaa ture.
I would have done that.	Silaa akkas nan godha ture.
She did something for me that I never knew.	Waan gonkumaa hin beekne naaf goote.
Now he had to go do that.	Amma akkas gochuuf deemuu qaba ture.
I can't believe she's mine.	Isheen kan koo ta'uu ishee amanuu hin danda'u.
No one else spoke.	Namni biraa hin dubbanne.
There is no other reason.	Sababni biraa hin jiru.
I want to be with him more.	Caalaatti isa waliin ta'uu barbaada.
We did not think much about it.	Waaʼee kanaa baayʼee hin yaadne turre.
I have a lot of work to do.	Hojii baay'een qaba.
Hope this helps someone.	Kun nama tokko akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
This is not true.	Kun dhugaa miti.
Not his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa miti.
I hope he has.	Akka qabu abdiin qaba.
Maybe he doesn't even know.	Tarii beekuu illee dhiisuu danda'a.
Outside of them, it’s just us.	Isaan ala, nu qofa.
His.	Kan isaa.
They were pretty bad.	Isaan baay'ee hamaa turan.
Not for a while, he had said.	Yeroo muraasaaf miti jedhee ture.
This went better than last time.	Kun yeroo darbe caalaa gaarii ta'ee deeme.
It can mean life.	Jireenya jechuu danda’a.
We need to work together.	Waliin hojjechuu qabna.
Only you can see her.	Ishee arguu kan dandeessu si qofa.
It was more of an idea.	Caalaatti yaada ture.
You might be right.	Sirrii ta'uu dandeessa.
I don't understand this.	Kana naaf hin galle.
This is not mine!	Kun kan koo miti!
Not three, not more, just two.	Sadii miti, kana caalaa miti, lama qofa.
But so far nothing has happened.	Garuu hanga ammaatti wanti ta'e hin jiru.
He was the only one who didn’t.	Kan hin qabne isa qofa ture.
Which should be for me.	Kan naaf ta'uu qabu.
It sounds too simple, but it works.	Garmalee salphaa fakkaata, garuu ni hojjeta.
He wasn’t in them.	Isaan keessa hin turre.
It wasn’t his.	Kan isaa hin turre.
But not very long.	Garuu baay'ee dheeraa miti.
But that’s not true.	Garuu sun dhugaa miti.
I don't know if that would do the job, but it could.	Sun hojii sana hojjechuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku, garuu ta'uu danda'a.
Must be a funny picture.	Suuraa qoosaa ta'uu qaba.
I must say it was excellent throughout.	Guutummaatti baayyee gaarii ture jechuun qaba.
I know my father.	Abbaa koo nan beeka.
It currently works for me.	Yeroo ammaa naaf hojjeta.
This couldn't be more true.	Kun kana caalaa dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Clocks and clocks of time.	Sa'aatii fi sa'aatii yeroo.
There! 	Achi!
It’s really not an easy thing.	Dhuguma waan salphaa miti.
That is not the case now.	Amma akkas miti.
I don't think so.	Ani hin yaadu.
I saw her many times.	Yeroo baayyee ishee arge.
You don't think much.	Ati baay'ee hin yaaddu.
He saw that it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane arge.
He is the truth.	Inni dhugaa dha.
That all works fine.	Sun hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I love this time of year.	Yeroo waggaa kana baay'een jaalladha.
He sits in the bar.	Mana dhugaatii keessa taa'a.
No problem, just a few questions.	Rakkoo hin qabu, gaaffii muraasa qofa.
It doesn't exist yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin jiru.
Maybe he just has nowhere else to go.	Tarii bakka biraa itti deemu qofa hin qabu ta'a.
You can’t tell anyone.	Namatti himuu hin dandeessu.
I hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
I like that to be true.	Sun dhugaa ta'ee natti tola.
Not who and what you are.	Eenyu fi maal akka taate miti.
He was great.	Inni guddaa ture.
So I don't know what she looks like.	Kanaaf maal akka fakkaattu hin beeku.
That doesn’t help.	Sun hin gargaaru.
No light there at all.	Ifa achitti tasumaa hin jiru.
He said he was in all the way.	Karaa hundumaa keessa akka jiru dubbate.
So it must be true.	Kanaaf dhugaa ta'uu qaba.
He loves you completely.	Guutummaatti si jaallata.
But that’s not easy to do.	Garuu sun gochuun salphaa miti.
She just couldn’t do it.	Isheen qofa gochuu hin dandeenye.
But not for long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraaf miti.
The feel of his hands on her.	Miira harka isaa ishee irratti.
I know what it is now.	Maal akka ta'e amma beeka.
He had nothing against the girl.	Intala sana irratti homaa hin qabu ture.
That's just out of the question.	Sun gaaffii keessaa ba'e qofa.
There had been no reason for it.	Sababni itti ta'u hin turre ture.
The real thing.	Waan dhugaa.
We stayed for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf turre.
He certainly didn’t think anything as bad as this.	Waan akka kanaa hamaa akka hin yaadne beekamaadha.
You have a lot to do in here.	As keessaa waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabdu.
I thought this was right.	Kun sirrii natti fakkaate.
It’s not a sound.	Sagalee miti.
They think our way.	Karaa keenya yaadu.
I couldn’t give up.	Ani harka kennuu hin dandeenye.
Good and bad.	Gaarii fi hamaa.
I want to tell you this.	Kana sitti himuu barbaada.
It certainly doesn’t work.	Akka hin hojjenne beekamaadha.
You knew that.	Ati kana beekta turte.
I couldn't tell.	Beekuu hin dandeenye.
I am here to stay.	Ani turuuf as jira.
It can be a very serious problem.	Rakkoo baay’ee hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
It should be, but it's not.	Ta'uu qaba, garuu hin ta'u.
But there seems to be more here.	Garuu asitti kana caalaa waan jiru fakkaata.
To do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf.
Only on the highway.	Karaa guddaa qofa irratti.
One that still doesn’t have a name.	Tokko kan ammallee maqaa hin qabne.
He was out there when everything went wrong.	Yeroo wanti hundi itti deemu achi ala ture.
You are not helpless.	Ati gargaarsa hin qabne miti.
We are the only ones who still have it.	Ammallee kan qabnu nu qofa.
Just not with me.	Ana waliin miti qofa.
Again, this is not true.	Ammas kun dhugaa miti.
I know this.	Kana nan beeka.
Now he thought he knew that.	Amma akkasitti waan beeku itti fakkaate.
He didn’t speak for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin dubbanne.
I don’t have the money right now.	Yeroo ammaa qarshii hin qabu.
Not everyone can do it.	Namni hundi gochuu hin danda'u.
Full-time father.	Abbaa yeroo guutuu.
They didn’t have one, there was no reason.	Tokko hin qaban turan, sababni hin turre.
It’s just that nothing is ever the same.	Wanti gonkumaa wal fakkaatu hin jiru qofa.
That's always going to be true.	Sun yeroo hundumaa dhugaa ta'uuf deema.
They have something we don’t have.	Waan nuti hin qabne qabu.
You have to go.	Deemu qabda.
You weren’t him.	Ati isa hin turre.
Clearly, this cannot be the case.	Kun akkas ta’uu akka hin dandeenye ifaadha.
He was still alone.	Ammallee kophaa isaa ture.
But I don’t know any of that.	Garuu sana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku.
So something is wrong.	Kanaaf wanti tokko dogoggora.
It’s not worse than that.	Kana caalaa hamaa miti.
You’re here now.	Amma as jirta.
But that didn’t happen.	Garuu sun hin taane.
Everything she can do.	Waan isheen gochuu dandeessu hunda.
He has to do some things.	Waan tokko tokko gochuu qaba.
I can't go back later.	Booda deebi'uu hin danda'u.
He was very happy.	Inni baay'ee gammade.
I hope it will be.	Akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
Long on demand.	Gaaffii irratti yeroo dheeraa.
But here’s something he still can’t let go of.	Garuu asitti wanti inni ammallee dhiisuu hin dandeenye tokko jira.
I mean, what the hell.	Maal ta'a jechuu kooti.
I should have given you everything.	Silaa waan hundumaa siif kennuu qaba ture.
I thought maybe he was in it.	Tarii keessa jira jedheen yaade.
I thought maybe you didn’t care.	Tarii ati dhimma hin qabdu jedheen yaade.
Glad to see so many of you here today.	Har'a hedduu keessan asitti arguu kootti gammadeera.
That would be my job.	Sun hojii koo ta'a ture.
If not, most people would do it.	Osoo hin taane namoonni baay'een ni hojjetu turan.
We saw a homeless man on the street.	Nama mana hin qabne tokko karaa irratti argine.
But they knew they had to go.	Garuu deemuun akka qaban ni beeku turan.
It seems to have worked so far.	Hanga ammaatti waan hojjete fakkaata.
Everything is working fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjechaa jira.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.	Garuu sun waan hamaa ta'uu hin qabu.
Today, everyone does everything.	Har'a namni hundi waan hunda hojjeta.
She isn’t.	Isheen miti.
This was a huge mistake.	Kun dogoggora guddaa ture.
It wouldn't be so bad tomorrow.	Boru akkas hamaa hin ta'u ture.
They knew we weren’t in for an easy time.	Yeroo salphaa keessa akka hin jirre beeku turan.
I know that he is very good.	Baayyee gaarii akka taʼe nan beeka.
Not in my area.	Naannoo kootti miti.
But that's not usually the case.	Garuu yeroo baayyee akkas miti.
He loved to do things.	Waan hojjechuu ni jaallata ture.
He was as big as me.	Akkuma koo guddaa ture.
A little not so.	Xiqqoo akkas miti.
No one had ever been there.	Namni achi turee hin beeku.
But now we are.	Amma garuu jirra.
So, tell me.	Kanaaf, natti himi.
He should have known.	Silaa beekuu qaba ture.
That’s what you need.	Kan si barbaachisu kanuma.
Sometimes it’s not easy but I want it, again, in my case.	Yeroo tokko tokko salphaa miti garuu barbaada, ammas, dhimma koo keessatti.
I could be completely wrong here.	Asitti guutummaatti dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
It doesn’t matter where it is.	Eessa akka jiru homaa hin qabu.
It was the place to be.	Bakka ta'uu qabu ture.
It worked really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjete.
There must be something in there, of course.	Achi keessa wanti tokko jiraachuu akka qabu beekamaadha.
No name of course.	Maqaa hin qabu beekamaadha.
I can't speak now.	Amma dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Clearly, this is not happening.	Kun ta’aa akka hin jirre ifaadha.
But he couldn't do it.	Garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
They know the answer.	Deebii isaa ni beeku.
But wait.	Garuu eegaa.
He doesn't go.	Inni hin deemu.
I didn't know all about that.	Waa'ee sana hunda hin beeku ture.
I didn't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu ture.
There was no time to react, it would be.	Yeroon deebii kennuu hin turre, ni ta'a.
You are looking for answers.	Deebii barbaadaa jirta.
That can't be a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
No chance of that here.	Carraan sanaa asitti hin jiru.
I saw them.	Isaan arge.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I have no idea if it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa yaada hin qabu.
But he knows he can’t.	Garuu akka hin dandeenye ni beeka.
I knew my wife.	Haadha manaa koo nan beeka ture.
She was in on it.	Isheen irra keessa turte.
At that point, most people will know who she is.	Yeroo sanatti namoonni baay'een eenyu akka taate ni beeku.
If you don't then you need it.	Yoo hin goone ta'e sana booda si barbaachisa.
I couldn’t eat it.	Nyaachuu hin dandeenye.
He can do it.	Inni ni danda'a.
It is not clear what this means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta’e ifa miti.
Which is rarely a good idea.	Kan yeroo muraasaaf yaada gaarii ta'e.
But he was a completely different guy.	Garuu gurbaa guutummaatti adda ta'e ture.
Be with me, please.	Na waliin ta'aa.
It would be more like important.	Caalaatti akka barbaachisaa ta'a ture.
We are still in that moment.	Ammas yeroo sanatti jirra.
I mean a lot.	Baay'ee jechuu kooti.
New money, of course.	Maallaqa haaraa, beekamaadha.
I'm looking for a girl.	Intala barbaadaa jira.
This was extremely important.	Kun garmalee barbaachisaa ture.
Which he was.	Kan inni ture.
Join me for a drink afterwards.	Booda dhugaatii na waliin ta'aa.
It would be wrong to do so.	Gochuun dogoggora ta'a.
I think that's the most important thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma natti fakkaata.
We have nothing.	Homaa hin qabnu.
It wouldn't be good, but then, nothing is good.	Silaa gaarii hin ta'u, garuu sana booda, wanti gaarii ta'e hin jiru.
There was no other opportunity.	Carraan biraa hin turre.
John could do no wrong here.	Yohaannis asitti dogoggora hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
He's the moo.	Inni moo.
What we just did.	Waan amma hojjenne.
Not just today.	Har'a qofa miti.
But we got along well.	Garuu gaarii waliin walii galle.
I love this place so much.	Bakka kana baay'een jaalladha.
You have to be.	Ta'uu qabda.
it can be extremely dangerous.	balaa garmalee guddaa ta’uu danda’a.
I was alone in the house.	Mana sanatti kophaa koo ture.
He's going to be.	Inni ni ta'a.
The longer one.	Kan dheeraa.
Why this helps is unclear.	Kun maaliif akka gargaaru ifa miti.
That is no longer in question.	Sun kana booda gaaffii keessa hin jiru.
But they were.	Garuu turan.
It was easy money for us.	Nuuf qarshii salphaa ture.
I know it's him.	Isa akka ta'e nan beeka.
He doesn’t just think about that.	Inni waan kana qofa hin yaadu.
He didn’t see me.	Inni na hin argine.
There is no one inside.	Namni keessa hin jiru.
We can’t do it without your help.	Gargaarsa keessan malee gochuu hin dandeenyu.
I didn't want to ask.	Gaafachuu hin barbaanne.
But no one wanted to see it.	Garuu namni arguu barbaade hin turre.
I can't believe this now.	Amma kana amanuu hin danda'u.
I can't find one.	Tokko argachuu hin danda'u.
Your saying that doesn’t do that.	Akkas jechuun kee akkas hin godhu.
Didn't do this when it was new.	Kun yeroo haaraa ture hin goone.
He may not play then.	Yeroo sanatti taphachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
That’s really what started his career.	Dhuguma hojii isaa kan jalqabe kanuma.
Glad to have found you.	Isin argachuu kootti gammadeera.
Hope you are the right parents.	Warra sirrii ta'uu keessan abdii qabna.
This wasn't happening.	Kun ta'aa hin turre.
We need more than that.	Kana caalaa nu barbaachisa.
I can't speak right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana dubbachuu hin danda'u.
But things like that won’t help you.	Garuu wanti akkasii si hin gargaaru.
It was my only hope.	Abdii koo qofa ture.
It would have been great to say the least.	Silaa kana caalaa yoo dubbanne waan guddaa ture.
I knew him well enough.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka ture.
. . . .	.
He was pretty big.	Inni baay'ee guddaa ture.
Sometimes it worked.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta ture.
Really good question.	Dhuguma gaaffii gaarii.
I can't leave him.	Isa dhiisuu hin danda'u.
It was a great thing.	Waan guddaa ture.
He is not a human being.	Inni nama miti.
It’s not that bad.	Hamma kana hamaa miti.
I can't give you his medical stuff.	Waan yaalaa isaa siif kennuu hin danda'u.
It looks good when you do it that way.	Yeroo akkasitti gootu gaarii fakkaata.
He got a few.	Muraasa argate.
Then it will be much easier.	Sana booda baayyee salphaa ta'a.
That you do this.	Akka ati kana gootu.
You know, all the time.	Beektaa, yeroo hunda.
But! 	Garuu!
It says money.	Maallaqa jedha.
This was the worst time of my life.	Yeroon kun jireenya koo keessatti yeroo hamaa ture.
This one has been around for a long time.	Inni kun yeroo dheeraaf ture.
But you don't.	Ati garuu hin gootu.
Now we need to do two things.	Amma waan lama gochuu qabna.
This just works.	Kun qofa hojjeta.
Something had to give.	Waan tokko kennuu qaba ture.
He was a father.	Inni abbaa ture.
It was my thing.	Waan koo ture.
Own money.	Maallaqa ofii.
I love that sort of thing.	Waan akkasii nan jaalladha.
Not her mother's man.	Nama haadha ishee miti.
It's becoming a joke.	Qoosaa ta'aa jira.
Not at all.	Tasumaa miti.
I will do my best.	Waan danda'u hunda nan godha.
She doesn’t want to go.	Isheen deemuu hin barbaaddu.
You might have to be.	Ta'uu qabda ta'a.
I can't see you.	Si arguu hin danda'u.
He saw you in his arms.	Harka isaa keessa si arge.
Look closely at the picture.	Suuraa sana sirriitti ilaalaa.
We don’t have kids.	Ijoollee hin qabnu.
I can't have it.	Ani qabaachuu hin danda'u.
But this one was different.	Inni kun garuu adda ture.
So he sits there.	Kanaaf achi taa'a.
We need it right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana nu barbaachisa.
You can come back later.	Booda deebi'uu dandeessu.
But I couldn't find out what it meant.	Garuu maal jechuu akka ta'e argachuu hin dandeenye.
Now it was my turn.	Amma yeroon koo ture.
They’re just kids.	Isaan ijoollee qofa.
But it's happening.	Garuu ta'aa jira.
Which is pretty good.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e.
That afternoon.	Sana waaree booda.
You have no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabdu.
There is nothing wrong.	Waan hamaa hin jiru.
It’s not your time.	Yeroon kee miti.
Very little enjoyed it.	Baayyee xiqqoo itti gammade.
I'm sure someone can find them.	Namni tokko isaan argachuu akka danda'u mirkanaa'adha.
I have no idea why this doesn't work.	Kun maaliif akka hin hojjenne yaada hin qabu.
It’s good for us.	Nuuf gaarii dha.
It's obviously not going to be that way.	Akkas ta'uuf akka hin deemne ifaadha.
But not my father.	Garuu abbaa koo miti.
It obviously involves money.	Maallaqa akka of keessaa qabu ifaadha.
I haven’t been able to do it, yet.	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye, hanga ammaatti.
I love new clothes!	Uffata haaraa baay'een jaalladha!
Then I saw my mother.	Sana booda haadha koo arge.
Once upon a time this was life.	Yeroo tokko kun jireenya ture.
That’s how I’m trying to do it.	Akkasitti gochuuf yaalaa jira.
What he said was that she should do what she loves.	Wanti inni jedhe waan jaallattu gochuu qabdi jedhee ture.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Achitti hojii dhuguma gaarii hojjete natti fakkaate.
Which wasn’t in it.	Kan keessa hin turre.
Glad it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane gammade.
You don’t understand.	Siif hin galle.
I didn’t know you had to have one.	Tokko qabaachuu akka qabdu hin beeku ture.
Probably a lot of us.	Tarii baay'ee keenya ta'a.
It's probably important.	Barbaachisaa ta'uu hin oolu.
He knew her well enough.	Inni akka gaariitti ishee beeka ture.
Maybe he's one of them.	Tarii inni isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu danda'a.
Later that day.	Booda guyyaa sana.
You in the car.	Ati konkolaataa keessa.
Not even a little bit.	Xiqqoo illee miti.
She is still not there.	Ammallee hin jirtu.
It looks new.	Haaraa fakkaata.
She was the only one who did.	Kan goote ishee qofa ture.
He loves you so much.	Inni baay'ee si jaallata.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammade.
I have to go.	Ani deemuu qaba.
He didn't do anything.	Tokkollee hin goone.
It was his life.	Jireenya isaa ture.
Before her two men.	Namoota ishee lamaan dura.
I probably think it will do me good.	Gaarii naaf godha jedheen yaada jedheen hin oolu.
Of course, he did not.	Akkas akka hin goone beekamaadha.
We need more than that.	Kana caalaa nu barbaachisa.
It was still home, but it was more than that.	Ammallee mana ture, garuu kana caalaa ture.
This is not the case.	Kun haala akkasii miti.
I have good days and bad days.	Guyyaa gaarii fi guyyaa hamaa qaba.
That's how we should do it.	Akkasitti gochuu qabna.
I came here.	Ani as dhufe.
What's going on today.	Har'a maaltu jira.
He made it his mother.	Haadha isaaf godhe.
This time it doesn’t matter.	Yeroon kun homaa hin qabu.
He didn't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himne.
It must be returned.	Deebi'uu qaba.
That’s how good it is.	Akkasitti gaarii dha.
What a man.	Maal nama.
That would be my father.	Sun abbaa koo ta'a ture.
I know this is not enough.	Kun gahaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
I know how to know.	Akkamitti akkan beeku nan beeka.
Two children in two houses.	Ijoollee lama mana lama keessatti.
We didn't know what to do.	Waan goonu hin beekne.
It can even go backwards.	Duubatti deebi'uu illee ni danda'a.
But he knew it wasn’t.	Garuu akka hin taane beeka ture.
Someone must be at the door.	Namni tokko balbala irra jiraachuu qaba.
I couldn’t find any.	Tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
It's never going to happen.	Gonkumaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
I mean, look at your situation.	Haala keessan ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
Maybe even a month.	Tarii ji'a tokko illee ta'a.
I’m just looking around.	Ani naannoo koo qofa ilaalaa jira.
There is no such thing as good or bad.	Wanti gaarii fi hamaa hin jiru.
But we didn’t.	Garuu nuti hin taane.
There was no one else she could see.	Namni biraa isheen arguu dandeessu achi hin turre.
I did as you said.	Anis akkuma ati jette godhe.
We’re just playing.	Nuti taphachuu qofa.
He had something great to tell her.	Waan guddaa itti himuu qaba ture.
Not how many times something happens, but whether it ever happens.	Wanti tokko yeroo meeqa ta'uu osoo hin taane, ta'ee beekuu fi dhiisuu isaa malee.
They don't have many friends.	Hiriyyoota baay'ee hin qaban.
One on the road.	Tokko karaa irra.
But things seem different.	Garuu wanti adda ta'e fakkaata.
She certainly didn’t go it alone.	Kophaa ishee akka hin deemne beekamaadha.
They will come to you.	Gara kee ni dhufu.
I need everyone there.	Nama achi jiru hunda na barbaachisa.
It was a huge disaster.	Balaa guddaa ture.
He couldn’t believe his luck.	Carraa isaa amanuu hin dandeenye.
I just don't know how to deal with it.	Akkamitti akkan itti danda'u qofa hin beeku.
She was not his mother.	Isheen haadha isaa hin turre.
Some hours maybe.	Sa'aatii tokko tokko tarii.
That sounds great.	Sun waan guddaa fakkaata.
A very tall man.	Nama baayyee dheeraa ta'e.
It's a very good feeling.	Miira baayyee gaarii dha.
He just asked questions.	Gaaffii qofa gaafate.
Which you do.	Kan ati gootu.
I wasn’t looking at her shoes.	Kophee ishee ilaalaa hin turre.
She said she didn't want to see you.	Si arguu hin barbaanne jette.
They had no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban turan.
That should help a lot.	Sun baayyee gargaaruu qaba.
He was right, to an extent.	Inni sirrii ture, hanga tokko.
I'm so sorry.	Ani akka malee dhiifama.
They were completely different then.	Yeroo sanatti guutummaatti adda turan.
He realized she was right.	Isheen sirrii akka taate hubate.
But there is reason for hope.	Garuu sababni abdii itti ta'u jira.
We have no one to deal with.	Nama waliin wal qabnu hin qabnu.
So.	Kanaaf.
They want the truth.	Waan dhugaa barbaadu.
We need to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
He is not one of us.	Inni nu keessaa tokko miti.
Sorry about another night.	Waa'ee halkan biraa dhiifama.
Do you have any suggestions?.	Yaada qabduu?.
How many times did he think that.	Yeroo meeqa akkas jedhee yaade.
But nothing is simple here.	Garuu asitti wanti salphaa ta'e hin jiru.
Not sure you can really do this.	Dhuguma kana gochuu akka dandeessu mirkanaa'aa miti.
Perhaps he was right.	Tarii sirrii ture taʼa.
It may not last.	Turuu dhiisuu danda'a.
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
She hadn’t told me.	Isheen natti hin himne turte.
I'm so sorry.	Akka malee dhiifama.
But then they were.	Garuu sana booda turan.
It'll be easy.	Salphaa ta'a.
I wouldn’t be in this situation.	Silaa haala kana keessa hin jiru ture.
Except that it is.	Ta'uu isaa malee.
But he didn't do that.	Garuu akkas hin goone.
He is a good man.	Inni nama gaarii dha.
I didn’t want to give any of this away.	Kana keessaa tokkollee kennuu hin barbaanne.
If it comes out, it's no big deal.	Yoo ba'e waan guddaa miti.
I know it's only a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa akka ta'e nan beeka.
I can't give you anything.	Ani homaa siif kennuu hin danda'u.
I know his mother.	Haadha isaa nan beeka.
. . . .	.
She didn’t know she was.	Isheen akka taate hin beektu turte.
It's the right name.	Maqaa sirrii dha.
He’s a good guy, really good.	Inni nama gaarii dha, dhuguma gaarii dha.
Two weeks later he came around.	Torban lama booda naannoo dhufe.
That was nice of me.	Sun natti tola ture.
I am very, very happy.	Baay'ee baay'een gammadeera.
Many of them, many, many.	Baay'een isaanii, baay'ee, baay'ee.
Sounds like you’re doing really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa akka jirtu fakkaata.
Nothing, that was enough.	Homaa hin qabu, sun gahaa ture.
Not that he ever will.	Yoomiyyuu akka godhu miti.
Now it was just the two of them.	Amma isaan lamaan qofa ture.
Everyone who came to live with us.	Kan nu waliin jiraachuu dhufe hundi.
I need clothes.	Uffata na barbaachisa.
I’m looking at them.	Isaan ilaalaa jira.
I don't do it now.	Ani amma hin godhu.
Tell me something new.	Waan haaraa natti himi.
I think this is inevitable.	Kun waan hin oolle natti fakkaata.
They have a car.	Konkolaataa tokko qabu.
Now I'm sure.	Amma mirkanaa'aa ta'e.
But not more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa miti.
I just love living my life.	Jireenya koo jiraachuu qofa nan jaalladha.
They have children.	Ijoollee qabu.
You are so good.	Ati akka malee gaarii dha.
He's waiting for you.	Si eegaa jira.
They knew everything that happened.	Waan ta'e hunda ni beeku turan.
A man of the wife.	Nama haadha manaa.
Everything is new and in excellent condition.	Wanti hundi haaraa fi haala gaarii irra jira.
I didn't think of anything else.	Waan biraa hin yaadne.
Few people saw him.	Namoonni isa arge muraasa.
It's not her, though.	Ishee miti garuu.
We had two new kids in our room alone.	Kutaa keenya keessatti qofa ijoollee haaraa lama qabna turre.
But he can't.	Garuu hin danda'u.
It’s not something new.	Waan haaraa miti.
This time it worked.	Yeroo kana hojjete.
That's when he left home.	Yeroo sana manaa ba'e.
That’s all well and good.	Sun hundi gaarii fi gaarii dha.
It doesn’t matter that it’s easy.	Salphaa jechuun homaa hin qabu.
But it’s not easy.	Garuu salphaa miti.
Time to do something.	Yeroon waan tokko hojjechuuf.
They couldn’t do it.	Isaan gochuu hin dandeenye.
It's better to be something.	Waan ta'uu wayya.
I'm going to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuuf deema.
He thought he could help.	Gargaaruu danda'a jedhee yaade.
It seems you can't.	Hin dandeessu fakkaata.
He bought that for you.	Sana siif bite.
Does anyone have any idea why this is happening.	Kun maaliif akka ta'aa jiru namni yaada qabu jiraa.
They have a life.	Jireenya qabu.
But, you know,.	Garuu, beekta,.
Nobody likes doing this job.	Hojii kana hojjechuu namni jaallatu hin jiru.
Another mistake.	Dogoggora biraa.
It's just too big.	Baayyee guddaa qofa.
I don't know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku.
I wish it wasn’t.	Osoo hin taane natti tola.
I had to go somewhere.	Bakka tokko deemuun dirqama ture.
This was mostly true.	Kun irra caalaa dhugaa ture.
A lot of people feel the same way right now.	Namoonni baay'een yeroo ammaa kana miira wal fakkaatu qabu.
So he went out.	Kanaaf ba'e.
That would work for me.	Sun naaf hojjeta ture.
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
But for us, it was never a bad thing.	Nuuf garuu waan hamaa ta'ee hin beeku.
What? 	Maal?
she said.	jette.
It is not the reality.	Dhugaa jiru miti.
But this is a possibility.	Garuu kun ta'uu danda'a.
As it was before.	Akkuma duraan ture.
I hope for the best.	Gaarii abdiin qaba.
But it was more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa ture.
I mean, I thought so.	Akkas jedheen yaade jechuu kooti.
I mean, a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee jechuu kooti.
Might.	Tarii.
He had three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba ture.
Maybe we should do a little something.	Tarii waan xiqqoo hojjechuu qabna ta'a.
He came here.	Halkan dhufe.
He wasn’t like that.	Inni akkas hin turre.
Again, the way.	Ammas karaa.
Unless it is.	Yoo ta'e malee.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan godhu hin turre.
It is absolutely correct.	Guutummaatti sirrii dha.
It should help with that.	Sana gargaaruu qaba.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
But they had a duty.	Garuu dirqama qabu turan.
Perhaps both are interested.	Tarii lamaan isaanii fedhii qabu.
They want to play.	Taphachuu barbaadu.
No need to respond.	Deebii kennuu hin barbaachisu.
I couldn’t get enough of him.	Isa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
There was still a job to be done.	Ammas hojiin tokko ni jira ture.
I said friends.	Hiriyyoota jedheen.
It seemed easy enough.	Hamma salphaa fakkaata ture.
They have to speak up.	Dubbachuu qabu.
There was, however.	Ni ture garuu.
A sense of missed opportunity.	Miira carraa darbe.
That wasn’t exactly right.	Sun sirriitti sirrii hin turre.
He needs help.	Gargaarsa barbaada.
It is clear to me that it is not.	Akka hin taane naaf ifaadha.
He loves her very much.	Baay'ee ishee jaallata.
You don’t have to, anymore.	Dirqama hin qabdu, kana booda.
That was when he said it.	Yeroo inni jedhe sana ture.
None of this is new.	Kana keessaa tokkollee haaraa miti.
Sometimes it goes like this.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkasitti deema.
We are no different from them.	Nuti isaan irraa adda miti.
The reality that we have.	Dhugaa jiru kan nuti qabnu.
The best way.	Karaa gaarii.
They intend to do something about the problem.	Rakkoo jiru irratti waan tokko gochuuf yaada qabu.
But we have someone who disagrees.	Garuu nama walii hin galle qabna.
That’s how everything works together.	Wanti hundi akkasitti waliin hojjeta.
I know I need it.	Akka na barbaachisu nan beeka.
It didn't seem likely.	Waan ta'uu danda'u hin fakkaatu ture.
This is the job he wanted.	Hojii inni barbaade kana.
I wonder when this is going to happen.	Kun yoom ta'uuf deema jedheen yaada.
One that is looking at me.	Tokko kan na ilaalaa jiru.
There was nothing he could say.	Wanti inni jechuu danda'u hin turre.
It might even happen sooner.	Dafee illee ta'uu danda'a.
I exist, you know.	Ani jira, beekta.
He was just a guy.	Inni gurbaa qofa ture.
It came out of my shoes.	Kophee koo keessaa ba'e.
Now, we have him.	Amma, isa qabna.
You can even say something.	Waan tokko illee dubbachuu dandeessa.
This is not helpful.	Kun nama hin gargaaru.
He didn’t do it.	Inni hin hojjenne.
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
I don’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beeku.
Which could be the worst.	Kan hamaa ta'uu danda'u.
All he said was to give it time.	Wanti inni jedhe yeroo kennuu qofa ture.
But most of us can't do that.	Garuu nuti baay'een akkas gochuu hin dandeenyu.
It was an excuse for both of us.	Lamaan keenya nuuf sababa ta'ee ture.
Right with us.	Sirriitti nu waliin.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baayyee itti gammade.
I think it must be you.	Si ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
Man has nothing.	Namni homaa hin qabu.
As one would expect.	Akkuma namni tokko eegaa ture.
So he went for a while .	Kanaaf yeroo muraasaaf ni deeme .
You can't get much bigger than that.	Kana caalaa baayyee guddaa argachuu hin dandeessu.
To help them out.	Isaan gargaaruuf.
He can't tell me where he's going.	Eessa akka deemu natti himuu hin danda'u.
No way.	Gonkumaa hin ta'u.
This is exactly my opinion.	Kun sirriitti yaada kooti.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I like it better that way.	Akkasitti caalaatti nan jaalladha.
He doesn't need to.	Inni hin barbaachisu.
So it can't be that bad.	Kanaaf hangas hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
It was kind of good for him.	Isaaf akka waan gaarii ture.
No one bought him for me.	Namni naaf isa bite hin turre.
He makes mistakes.	Dogoggora ni hojjeta.
It's just, something about it.	Inni qofa, waa'ee isaa waan tokko.
No one else is here.	Namni biraa as hin jiru.
So no problem there.	Kanaaf achitti rakkoon hin jiru.
That wasn’t right.	Sun sirrii hin turre.
Something about the guy.	Waa'ee gurbaa sanaa waan tokko.
But it is an important fact.	Garuu dhugaa barbaachisaa dha.
Good girl!	Intala gaarii!
Nothing happened this time.	Yeroo kana wanti ta'e hin jiru.
That may not be long enough.	Sun dheeraa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I am a mother.	Ani haadha.
I couldn’t get an eye on them.	Ija isaan irratti argachuu hin dandeenye.
He didn't want to be.	Inni ta'uu hin barbaanne.
You weren’t here.	Ati as hin turre.
They’re really just friends.	Dhuguma hiriyyoota qofa.
This is going to be huge.	Kun guddaa ta'uuf deema.
Not sure if it's accurate.	Sirrii ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
Maybe I can never come back.	Tarii gonkumaa deebi'uu hin danda'u.
She should be back in a couple of days.	Guyyaa lama lama booda deebi'uu qabdi.
It may be as it is.	Akkuma ta'e ta'uu danda'a.
The chances of getting a job are bright.	Carraan hojii argachuu ifaadha.
It was a very big accident.	Balaa baayyee guddaa ture.
Clearly, it may not.	Taʼuu dhiisuu akka dandaʼu ifaadha.
It’s a house.	Mana dha.
This time was different.	Yeroon kun adda ture.
Little by little.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo.
But he didn't see her.	Garuu ishee hin argine.
That’s not entirely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
This must be a mistake!	Kun dogoggora ta'uu qaba!
He wanted a house.	Mana barbaade.
Not then, he thought.	Yeroo sanatti miti jedhee yaade.
Without being.	Osoo hin taane.
It shouldn't have been, but it had.	Ta'uu hin qabu ture, garuu ni qaba ture.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
I could go now.	Amma deemuu nan danda'a ture.
Most of the time it looks like nothing.	Yeroo baayyee homaa hin fakkaatu.
I just think that’s me.	Ani garuu sun ana natti fakkaata.
So she did that.	Kanaaf akkas goote.
It was necessary though.	Barbaachisaa ture garuu.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Ani nan shakka, garuu tarii.
Last time I couldn’t.	Yeroo darbe hin dandeenye.
It was his best year.	Bara isaa isa gaarii ture.
I thought about what to do.	Waan godhu jedheen yaade.
I have two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama qaba.
That couldn't have been easy.	Sun salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
It was tomorrow.	Boru turte.
Trouble was possible.	Rakkoon ni danda'ama ture.
It's very long.	Baayyee dheeraa dha.
One, try and see.	Tokko, yaalaa ilaalaa.
Then he had to see it.	Sana booda arguu qaba ture.
It never happened before.	Duraan akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
That it may be.	Akka ta'uuf.
My language, so wrong.	Afaan koo, kanaaf dogoggora.
This is very good.	Kun baayyee gaarii dha.
So we can never know.	Kanaaf gonkumaa beekuu hin dandeenyu.
Or a handful? 	Moo harka tokko?
It must be him.	Isa ta'uu qaba.
This is a good house.	Kun mana gaarii dha.
He knows what he can do.	Waan gochuu dandaʼu ni beeka.
Now all he could see was himself.	Amma wanti inni arguu danda'u ofii isaa qofa ture.
He took a job.	Hojii fudhate.
A lot of things happened.	Wanti baay'een ta'e.
It’s my problem.	Rakkoo kooti.
I have exactly the same issue.	Anis sirriitti dhimma wal fakkaatu qaba.
That’s exactly what it was.	Sirriitti kanuma ture.
I think more of everyone in the house.	Nama mana keessa jiru hunda caalaa nan yaada.
I'm sure that would be great.	Sun waan guddaa akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha.
We were doing that well.	Sana akka gaariitti hojjechaa turre.
Things are better without my feelings.	Miira koo malee wanti wayya.
You don’t need it anymore.	Kana booda si hin barbaachisu.
A couple of years.	Waggaa lama lama.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
I want to go back there.	Achitti deebi'uu barbaada.
I was three years old.	Umuriin koo waggaa sadii ture.
They are doing well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa jiru.
It was obvious enough why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ifa gahaa ture.
We need to do something right.	Waan tokko sirriitti hojjechuu qabna.
You can live in my house.	Mana koo keessa jiraachuu dandeessa.
I'm pretty sure we do.	Akka goonu baay'een mirkanaa'adha.
Like this morning.	Akkuma ganama kanaa.
Now that was the case.	Amma akkas ture.
Things are different here now.	Asitti amma wanti adda adda.
He wasn’t a bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa hin turre.
They have to work.	Hojjechuu qabu.
I know we are friends.	Hiriyyoota akka taane nan beeka.
He won't tell me.	Natti hin himu.
Other than that, nothing is wrong though.	Kana malee wanti dogoggora ta'e hin jiru garuu.
I thought of her above all else.	Ani hunda caalaa ishee yaade.
Among them.	Isaan keessaa.
That’s not a problem.	Sun rakkoo hin qabu.
He came from around here.	Inni naannoo as irraa dhufe.
Now it looks like another house.	Amma mana biraa fakkaata.
We are in trouble here.	Asitti rakkoo keessa jirra.
They didn't need much else.	Waan biraa baay'ee isaan hin barbaachifne.
Everyone loves children.	Namni hundi ijoollee ni jaallata.
But really, it’s not a bad thing.	Garuu dhuguma, waan hamaa miti.
I used to want what you had.	Duraan waan ati qabdu barbaada ture.
She wouldn't have known.	Silaa hin beektu turte.
I wanted to do it again.	Ammas gochuun barbaade.
I thought he had gone a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura waan deeme natti fakkaate.
I told him that.	Akkas jedheen itti hime.
She had an answer.	Deebii qabdi turte.
I don't want you.	Si hin barbaadu.
We had that moment.	Yeroo sana qabna turre.
That was not to be.	Sun taʼuu hin qabu ture.
These two are very similar.	Lamaan kun baayyee wal fakkaatu.
But so far there was no luck at all.	Garuu hanga ammaatti carraan tasumaa hin turre.
He saw himself.	Of arge.
Except for the past.	Kan darbe malee.
Nobody ever goes away.	Namni gonkumaa hin deemu.
They were watching.	Isaan ilaalaa turan.
Lots of jokes.	Qoosaa baay'ee.
No one else, nothing else.	Namni biraa hin jiru, wanti biraa hin jiru.
Just another year.	Waggaa biraa qofa.
He only needs to stay three hours.	Sa'aatii sadii qofa turuu isa barbaachisa.
Not one of them.	Tokkollee miti.
It gave me hope.	Abdii naaf kenne.
Living around here.	Kan naannoo as jiraachuu.
But that someone is not me.	Garuu namni tokko ana akka hin taane.
It has happened often but not always.	Yeroo baayyee ta'aa tureera garuu yeroo hunda hin jiru.
It wasn’t necessary, you know.	Barbaachisaa hin turre beekta.
The task is not easy.	Hojiin salphaa miti.
It's not mine.	Kan koo miti.
It was late in the afternoon.	Yeroon isaa waaree booda ture.
It seemed a lifetime ago.	Jireenya guutuu dura fakkaata ture.
We never were.	Nuti gonkumaa hin taane.
If he goes, he will go.	Yoo deeme ni deema.
On their work.	Hojii isaanii irratti.
I think we have a problem.	Rakkoo qabna jedheen yaada.
That's what happened today.	Har'a kan ta'e kanuma.
What is this? 	Kun maali?
This will never happen.	Kun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
Just look at it.	Mee ilaalaa qofa.
Everyone was totally into it.	Namni hundi guutummaatti keessa ture.
But he was wrong.	Inni garuu dogoggora ture.
But now he, is gone.	Amma garuu inni, hin jiru.
But many people.	Garuu namoonni baay'een.
It works on mine.	Kan koo irratti ni hojjeta.
Maybe someone else can.	Tarii namni biraa ni danda'a.
It's a good book.	Kitaaba gaarii dha.
I know you better than that.	Kana caalaa si beeka.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
None seemed exactly on point.	Tokkollee sirriitti waan yaada keessa jiru hin fakkaatu ture.
He didn't need it.	Isa hin barbaachifne.
But about this.	Garuu waa'ee kanaa.
She was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii turte.
He should have been more fortunate.	Silaa carraa guddaa argachuu qaba ture.
This night was different.	Halkan kun adda ta'ee ture.
That obviously wasn’t real life.	Sun jireenya dhugaa akka hin turre ifaadha.
I wasn't meant to be.	Ani akka ta'uuf hin turre.
He thought about it.	Itti yaade.
She was right, you know.	Isheen sirrii turte beekta.
I think we need more.	Kana caalaa waan nu barbaachisu natti fakkaata.
I have to ask you something.	Waan tokko si gaafachuu qaba.
Now was the real time.	Amma yeroon dhugaa ture.
It's just what happened.	Waan ta'e qofa.
Maybe in a week.	Tarii torban tokko booda ta'uu danda'a.
That would do it for me.	Sun naaf godha ture.
Maybe not much, maybe longer.	Tarii baay'ee miti, tarii yeroo dheeraa.
A long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura.
There was nothing there.	Achitti wanti jiru hin turre.
It’s not an idea.	Yaada miti.
I don't want to go back to my place.	Bakka kootti deebi'uu hin barbaadu.
There was really nothing else she could do.	Dhuguma wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu kan biraa hin turre.
It's not happening now.	Amma ta'aa hin jiru.
He just knows.	Inni qofa beeka.
I couldn’t ask him anything.	Homaa isa gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
And he did it again.	Ammas ni godhe.
Someone had to do that.	Namni tokko akkas gochuu qaba ture.
I really just can't get enough.	Dhuguma qofa gahaa argachuu hin danda'u.
She said it happened a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ta'e jette.
Not a bad morning routine.	Hojii ganama hamaa miti.
But he is.	Garuu inni.
The work is there.	Hojiin achi jira.
For a moment they were themselves again.	Yeroo muraasaaf ammas ofii isaanii turan.
It’s not someone you know.	Nama beekuu miti.
A car she didn’t go there.	Konkolaataa isheen achi hin deemne.
But that was no longer the case.	Garuu kana booda akkas hin turre.
That’s not to say.	Kana jechuun miti.
I wasn’t real to him.	Ani isaaf dhugaa hin turre.
Certainly not on some.	Tokko tokko irratti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
It doesn’t matter who says it.	Eenyu akka jedhu homaa hin qabu.
One person has a problem, one doesn’t.	Namni tokko rakkoo qaba, tokko hin qabu.
Everything being in question again.	Wanti hundi ammas gaaffii keessa jiraachuu.
Sometimes it doesn't.	Yeroo tokko tokko hin ta'u.
She is never around again.	Kana booda gonkumaa naannoo hin jirtu.
I never knew it.	Ani gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
I don’t need anyone.	Nama tokkollee na hin barbaachisu.
It works for me then.	Yeroo sana naaf hojjeta.
But one day it started.	Garuu guyyaa tokko jalqabe.
You weren’t there.	Ati hin turre.
It became clear that he had no idea what had happened.	Waan ta'e yaada akka hin qabne ifa ta'e.
Complete without him.	Isa malee guutuu.
Always.	Yeroo hundumaa.
It worked once before.	Yeroo tokko dura hojjete.
You have children.	Ijoollee qabda.
That didn’t work this time.	Sun yeroo kana hin hojjenne.
Please look at me.	Mee na ilaalaa.
This may just be the most important one.	Kun isa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe qofa taʼuu dandaʼa.
Only the good ones.	Kan gaarii qofa.
Here, no one knew me.	Asitti, namni na beeku hin turre.
That's what it should be.	Kana ta'uu qaba.
I don't have any problems.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin qabu.
You need to tell me what is happening here.	Asitti waan ta'aa jiru natti himuu qabdu.
We need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna.
Maybe she should do it.	Tarii isheen gochuu qabdi ta'a.
I think he’s right there.	Inni sirriitti achi jira jedheen yaada.
This was a good one.	Kun gaarii ture.
Things are never enough.	Wanti gonkumaa gahaa miti.
But none of this is new.	Garuu kana keessaa tokkollee haaraa miti.
Everyone wants to play.	Namni hundi taphachuu barbaada.
It didn't really look like much.	Dhuguma baay'ee hin fakkaatu ture.
You just don’t need it anymore.	Kana booda si hin barbaachisu qofa.
How old are you?	Umuriin kee meeqa?
Then you have to tell him.	Sana booda itti himuu qabda.
We have a lot of handles.	Qabduu baay'ee qabna.
This is not the only issue that.	Dhimma kana qofa miti kan.
We’re doing the best we can.	Waan dandeenyu hunda hojjechaa jirra.
None is required.	Tokkollee hin barbaachisu.
We didn’t see what we should have seen.	Waan silaa arguu qabnu hin argine.
But I couldn’t stay indoors.	Garuu mana keessa turuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe that was all.	Tarii kana qofa ture.
Nothing special.	Wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
This was right.	Kun sirrii ture.
Everything else is still here.	Wanti biraa hundi ammallee as jira.
You don’t do it.	Hin gootu.
This is no small matter.	Kun dhimma xiqqoo miti.
I am nothing.	Ani homaa miti.
I can't believe he's gone.	Inni akka hin jirre amanuu hin danda'u.
That wasn’t the case before that night.	Halkan sana dura akkas hin turre.
Then wait two days.	Sana booda guyyaa lama eegaa.
He wanted that night.	Halkan sana barbaade.
Not now.	Amma miti.
I really didn’t know what to think.	Dhuguma maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture.
They were really great.	Dhuguma guddaa turan.
Nothing seems to be going his way.	Wanti karaa isaa deemu waan hin jirre fakkaata.
There is a reason inside.	Keessatti sababni jira.
It may not be for you.	Siif ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
He never knew it.	Inni gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
I don't know what that means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku.
That sounds good.	Sun gaarii fakkaata.
None of them will come.	Tokkollee hin dhufu.
Not that he needs it.	Ni isa barbaachisa jechuu miti.
We don’t think it’s a good idea.	Yaada gaarii nutti hin fakkaatu.
But he was not my husband.	Inni garuu abbaa manaa koo hin turre.
It’s never my favorite thing.	Gonkumaa wanti ani jaalladhu miti.
For a while now.	Yeroo muraasaaf amma.
It could have happened even earlier.	Silaa kanaan dura illee ta’uu danda’a.
You don’t have it yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin qabdu.
It wasn’t like him.	Akka isaa hin turre.
Nothing is inevitable.	Wanti hin taane hin oolu.
I had said, 'It's not.	jedheen ture.
It was just bad luck.	Carraa hamaa qofa ture.
He doesn't like children.	Ijoollee hin jaallatu.
We need their help.	Gargaarsa isaanii nu barbaachisa.
I want to believe that it is.	Akkas ta'uu isaa amanuu barbaada.
She was at home.	Isheen mana turte.
But what do they look like?.	Garuu maal fakkaatu?.
The reason for this is unclear.	Sababni kanaa ifa miti.
I couldn't do it.	Ani hin dandeenye.
But that wasn’t always the case.	Garuu yeroo hunda akkas hin turre.
Almost easy money.	Maallaqa salphaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
You are one of them.	Ati isa keessaa tokko.
He seemed to mean it.	Inni waan jechuu barbaade fakkaata ture.
We got into trouble a few times.	Yeroo muraasa rakkoo keessa galle.
I really don't know why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
You just did it.	Ati qofa goote.
No one knew this.	Namni kana beeku hin turre.
Someone like.	Nama akka.
I mean, not really.	Dhuguma miti jechuu kooti.
There’s always that possibility .	Yeroo hundumaa carraan sun jira .
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
That’s nice and clear.	Sun gaarii fi ifaadha.
I love this picture.	Suuraa kana baay'een jaalladha.
It really came to me.	Dhuguma natti dhufe.
He probably already knows the answer.	Deebii isaa duruu beekuu hin oolu.
That was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture.
This is not true, however.	Kun garuu dhugaa miti.
He’s talked a little about her present.	Waa’ee ammaa ishee xiqqoo dubbateera.
Where I haven’t been before.	Bakka kanaan dura hin turre.
These were in grave danger.	Isaan kun balaa guddaa irra turan.
It was like her own father.	Akka abbaa ishee ofii ture.
I have two of mine.	Kan koo lama qaba.
I won't say it here.	Asitti hin jedhu.
It will happen, however.	Ni ta'a garuu.
They like the sound of their own voice.	Sagalee sagalee ofii isaanii ni jaallatu.
Almost all of us are.	Hundi keenya jechuun ni danda'ama.
I just didn’t know what to do.	Waan godhu qofa hin beeku ture.
I'll be here tomorrow.	Boru as jira.
It's a terrible thing.	Waan hamaa.
He eats his food quickly.	Nyaata isaa dafee nyaata.
But if.	Garuu yoo.
It seemed more important.	Caalaatti barbaachisaa fakkaata ture.
I made it look like that.	Akkas akka fakkaatu nan godhe.
I have a picture of him.	Suuraa isaa qaba.
I would never have done that at my house.	Silaa mana kootti gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
He saw the worst of people.	Namoota keessaa isa hamaa ta'e arge.
Now you know where you are.	Amma bakka jirtu beekta.
Of course, he could be forgiven.	Dhiifama argachuu akka dandaʼu beekamaadha.
I still don't know.	Ammallee hin beeku.
But this time, it was different.	Yeroo kana garuu, adda ture.
Great sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa guddaa.
Some really good ideas.	Yaada dhuguma gaarii tokko tokko.
No one likes to leave us alone, not even me.	Namni kophaa nu dhiisuu jaallatu hin jiru, ana illee miti.
Not after what just happened.	Waan amma ta'e booda miti.
That's an idea.	Sun yaada.
This is clearly a mistake.	Kun dogoggora akka ta’e ifaadha.
They didn’t see me.	Isaan na hin argine.
I think you will.	Ni gootu jedheen yaada.
Maybe he should go.	Tarii deemuu qaba ta'a.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
What went wrong?	Maaltu dogoggora ta'e?
He is not a part.	Inni kutaa miti.
It was just the past.	Kan darbe qofa ture.
She doesn’t have it.	Isheen hin qabdu.
A very important person.	Nama baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e.
That worked both ways.	Sun karaa lamaan hojjete.
I know how you know.	Akkamitti akka beektu nan beeka.
But absolutely nothing else.	Garuu wanti biraa gonkumaa hin jiru.
You just have no idea.	Ati yaada hin qabne qofa.
Everything will be fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'a.
There can be no such thing.	Wanti akkasii jiraachuu hin danda'u.
But she was at home.	Isheen garuu mana turte.
That’s how we are.	Nuti akkas jirra.
That 's all	Kanuma qofa .
It could be a lot more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee ta'uu danda'a.
Maybe it's probably.	Tarii ta'uu hin oolu.
How old is it now?	Amma bara meeqa?
I am right here.	Ani sirriitti as jira.
This was not true.	Kun dhugaa hin turre.
Two of them are together.	Isaan keessaa lama waliin jiru.
We did it all this morning.	Ganama kana hunda hojjenne.
You have to get a job.	Hojii argachuu qabda.
This is just before doing that.	Kun sana gochuu dura qofa.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
Otherwise, you never know what could happen.	Yoo kana hin taane, waan ta'uu danda'u gonkumaa hin beektu.
It's going to be great.	Guddaa ta'a.
About too good.	Waa'ee garmalee gaarii.
I couldn’t find one.	Tokko argachuu hin dandeenye.
Who we were.	Eenyu akka turre.
But maybe it's something else.	Garuu tarii waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
If lucky, he thought.	Carraa yoo ta'e jedhee yaade.
That's one of my favorite things to talk about.	Wantoota ani dubbachuu baay'ee jaalladhu keessaa tokko kanuma.
It was probably going to happen.	Ta'uu hin oolu ture.
She must be .	Isheen ta'uu qabdi .
They have no obligation.	Dirqama hin qaban.
You don’t have to, you know.	Dirqama hin qabdu, beekta.
In the food.	Nyaata keessatti.
She did everything she could to help.	Gargaaruuf waan dandeessu hunda goote.
It’s not great but it works well for me.	Guddaa miti garuu akka gaariitti naaf hojjeta.
He is no longer here.	Kana booda as hin jiru.
But now, there is nothing.	Amma garuu, homaa hin jiru.
I want this more than anything.	Ani waan hundumaa caalaa kana baay'een barbaada.
They have a name.	Maqaa qabu.
But she has feelings.	Garuu miira qabdi.
He is tall.	Inni dheeraa dha.
If that's what you want.	Yoo akkas barbaaddu ta'e.
They can do it again.	Ammas gochuu dandaʼu.
Just about the girl.	Waa'ee intala qofa.
Now he had him.	Amma isa qaba ture.
You can tell me.	Natti himuu dandeessu.
A husband she didn’t want.	Abbaa manaa isheen hin barbaanne.
But that was unlikely.	Garuu sun taʼuu hin oolu ture.
Everyone here is on to something.	Namni as jiru hundi waan tokko irra jira.
Better not stay here.	Asitti osoo hin turre wayya.
Area one must be.	Naannoo namni tokko ta'uu qaba.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
But he was so much more than that.	Inni garuu kana caalaa baayʼee ture.
Last week's photo.	Suuraa torban darbe.
Not much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee miti.
It was just one of many.	Baay'ee keessaa tokko qofa ture.
No one would say anything.	Namni homaa hin jedhu ture.
It was on his own.	Ofii isaatiin ture.
It is not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa miti.
Only from non-humans.	Namoota nama hin taane irraa qofa.
I couldn't stay.	Turuu hin dandeenye.
He has a great deal to do this.	Kana hojjechuu guddaa qaba.
It was only once.	Yeroo tokko qofa ture.
You don't have to go back anymore .	Kana booda duubatti deebi'uu hin qabdu .
It will never be perfect.	Yoomiyyuu guutuu hin ta'u.
I looked at it from the other side.	Anis ija biraa irraa ilaale.
It was a long night.	Halkan dheeraa ture.
So you never know.	Kanaaf ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
He had no one to go with him.	Nama waliin deemu hin qabu ture.
Nothing is out of place, yet .	Wanti bakka hin qabne hin jiru, ammas .
I'm good at this.	Ani kana irratti ga'umsa qaba.
Which, we.	Kan, nuti.
I can't really do much with him.	Dhuguma isa waliin ta'ee waan baay'ee hojjechuu hin danda'u.
But he had become irrelevant.	Garuu inni barbaachisaa hin taane ta'ee ture.
But not sure how you can make it happen.	Garuu akkamitti akka ta'u gochuu akka dandeessu mirkanaa'aa miti.
I'm sure you have.	Akka qabdu mirkanaa'adha.
You have to ask how you can do this to him.	Akkamitti kana isa gochuu dandeessa jettee gaafachuu qabda.
Many people were with him.	Namoota baay'een waliin turan.
I don’t like them anymore.	Kana booda isaan hin jaalladhu.
It was obvious what she was up to.	Maal irra akka jirtu ifa ture.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
That’s not so bad.	Sun akkas hamaa miti.
Love him again.	Ammas isa jaalladhu.
The problem was, there were a lot of them.	Rakkoon ture, baay'ee ture.
She was everywhere in the house.	Mana keessa bakka hunda turte.
I knew something was wrong with me.	Waan tokko akka naaf hin taane beeka ture.
It was only a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa ture.
You know it, you know.	Ni beekta.
It came out in an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko keessatti ba'e.
But he doesn't.	Garuu hin godhu.
I know that he knows.	Inni akka beeku nan beeka.
They’re definitely gone.	Isaan deemuun isaanii hin oolu.
It's probably a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu hin oolu.
You don't want to be like him.	Akka isaa ta'uu hin barbaaddu.
I can see nothing but money.	Maallaqa malee homaa arguu hin danda'u.
Not entirely sure how to do it, but there it is.	Akkamitti akka goonu guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti, garuu achi jira.
This, of course, should not be the case.	Kun, ta’uu akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
I have the time.	Yeroon qaba.
I have a lot of work to do here.	Asitti hojiin baay'ee qaba.
It was unclear why this was the case.	Maaliif akkas akka ta'e ifa hin turre.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
Seeing yourself and what could be matters.	Of arguu fi waan ta'uu danda'u dhimma.
It seems to have worked.	Hojjete fakkaata.
Some people like you for you.	Namoonni tokko tokko siif si jaallatu.
Everything looked good.	Wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
I know it in myself.	Ofii koo keessatti beeka.
I wish it was easier, about it.	Osoo salphaa ta'ee natti tola, waa'ee isaa.
I've never been one to do that.	Ani nama akkas godhu ta'ee hin beeku.
I don’t know anything like that.	Waan akkasii tokkollee hin beeku.
This one is the one.	Inni kun isa.
That sounds like a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii fakkaata.
Try them on for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan irratti yaalaa.
I can't do much of anything.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu hin danda'u.
When they have a voice.	Yeroo sagalee qabu.
That one seems to do too much.	Inni sun garmalee waan baay'ee hojjetu fakkaata.
I will never do that again.	Kana booda gonkumaa akkas hin godhu.
Your people.	Namoonni keessan.
It’s not like that.	Akkasitti miti.
For this reason they can be extremely helpful.	Sababa kanaaf garmalee gargaaruu danda’u.
This is not very good, but better.	Kun baayyee gaarii miti, garuu wayya.
It’s not my business though.	Dhimma koo miti garuu.
We have what it takes to be the best.	Irra caalaa ta'uuf waan barbaachisu qabna.
He was just what you needed at that moment.	Inni yeroo sanatti waan si barbaachisu qofa ture.
But we are still waiting for an answer.	Garuu ammallee deebii eegaa jirra.
In this case, it’s pretty incomplete.	Haala kana keessatti, baay’ee guutuu miti.
I couldn't have asked for more.	Silaa kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture.
Just one of you guys.	Isin keessaa tokko qofa.
All night, really.	Halkan guutuu, dhuguma.
So it’s time for it.	Kanaaf yeroon isaa.
He was very happy to be with him.	Inni baayʼee isa waliin taʼuu isaatti gammadeera.
It’s not just a whole job.	Hojii guutuu qofa miti.
It won’t do anything for you.	Homaa siif hin godhu.
Not above this.	Kana irra miti.
They had no intention of doing anything.	Homaa hojjechuuf yaada hin qaban turan.
I had you all the way.	Karaa hunda keessan qaba ture.
He is a two-man.	Inni nama lama.
Constant accompaniment to daily life.	Jireenya guyyaa guyyaa waliin yeroo hunda kan deemu.
He really had it all.	Dhuguma hunda qaba ture.
I didn’t want to live there anymore.	Kana booda achi jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
That’s what we need.	Kan nu barbaachisu kanuma.
Today, not tomorrow.	Har'a malee boru miti.
It didn't look very good.	Baay'ee gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
People were probably watching us.	Namoonni nu ilaalaa turan taʼuu hin oolu.
Chances are, you know a few.	Carraan jiru, muraasa beektu.
Sometimes that works.	Yeroo tokko tokko sun ni hojjeta.
Which I am not.	Kan ani hin taane.
There was no hope for me.	Abdiin naaf hin turre.
That wasn’t all, though.	Kana qofa hin turre garuu.
I thought this was the place to be.	Bakka ta'uu qabu kana natti fakkaate.
It's about me.	Waa'ee kooti.
This is very important.	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
But she had to do it.	Garuu isheen gochuu qabdi turte.
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
She was all good.	Hundi ishee gaarii ture.
It’s not really my thing.	Dhuguma waan koo miti.
It was the worst.	Kan hamaa ture.
It's good to go.	Deemuun gaarii dha.
Certainly it will in some cases.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti akka ta’u beekamaadha.
Age doesn’t matter.	Umuriin homaa hin qabu.
That would be fine.	Sun gaarii ta'a ture.
But now I can see it.	Amma garuu arguu nan danda'a.
Very few people are good at this.	Namoonni kana irratti ga'umsa qaban baay'ee muraasa.
I don't know what's right.	Waan sirrii ta'e hin beeku.
You have to do this.	Kana gochuu qabda.
We need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna.
Then he didn't go.	Sana booda hin deemne.
I know that's asking a lot,.	Sun waan baay'ee gaafachuu akka ta'e nan beeka,.
You just said that.	Ati akkas jettee qofa.
He will certainly come.	Inni akka dhufu beekamaadha.
It’s not my job.	Hojii koo miti.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
There aren't many of them.	Isaan baay'ee miti.
Soon, they all will be.	Yeroo dhiyootti, hundi isaanii ni ta'u.
But he wouldn’t do it.	Garuu hin godhu ture.
We were there, too.	Nuti illee turre.
We have many questions and answers about him here.	Waa'ee isaa gaaffii fi deebii hedduu asitti qabna.
She was his daughter.	Isheen intala isaa turte.
I really don’t know what else to say.	Dhuguma waan biraa akkan jedhu hin beeku.
What you can afford should be good enough.	Wanti ati dandeessu gaarii gahaa ta'uu qaba.
There is almost no one outside.	Nama ala jiru hin jiru jechuun ni danda'ama.
He often walks his dog.	Yeroo baayyee saree isaa deema.
No sound from him.	Sagalee tokkollee isa irraa hin jiru.
All was nice and easy again.	Hundi ammas gaarii fi salphaa ture.
Perhaps it was my problem.	Tarii rakkoo koo taʼuu dandaʼa.
Maybe it never happens.	Tarii gonkumaa akka hin taane ta'uu danda'a.
Everyone wants answers.	Namni hundi deebii barbaada.
I never thought he would be bigger than me.	Yoomiyyuu na caalaa guddaa ta'a jedhee hin yaadne.
None of it was a big deal.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan guddaa hin turre.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Waan ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
We are going to do it again this week.	Torban kana keessa ammas hojjechuuf jirra.
Maybe nothing too big.	Tarii wanti baay'ee guddaa ta'e hin jiru.
Years and years and years of them.	Waggaa fi waggaa fi waggaa isaanii.
But he knew he was there.	Inni garuu achi akka jiru beeka ture.
It was everyday life.	Jireenya guyyaa guyyaa ture.
But only here.	Garuu as qofa.
One is not too good.	Tokko garmalee gaarii miti.
She is no longer with us.	Kana booda nu bira hin jirtu.
It was good of him to do so.	Akkas gochuun isaa gaarii ture.
The time was now.	Yeroon isaa amma ture.
This is all good.	Kun hundi gaarii dha.
I think you have a lot in common.	Waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu qabdu jedheen yaada.
I couldn’t believe what we just did.	Waan amma hojjenne amanuu hin dandeenye.
You know it really is.	Dhuguma akka ta'e ni beekta.
Very few people.	Namoonni baayyee muraasa.
I really like them both.	Dhuguma isaan lamaan nan jaalladha.
But, this one works.	Garuu, inni kun ni hojjeta.
You're pretty right about that sort of thing.	Waa'ee waan akkasii baay'ee sirrii dha.
My real life.	Jireenya koo isa dhugaa.
This can’t be the case.	Kun ta’uu hin danda’u.
So sorry for that.	Kanaaf dhiifama.
That was a different case.	Sun dhimma adda ture.
So go for it.	Kanaaf itti deemaa.
It has a sound.	Sagalee qaba.
People seem to have a lot to offer.	Namoonni waan baay'ee waan qaban fakkaata.
Maybe not ever.	Tarii gonkumaa miti.
That means he doesn't even think about himself.	Kana jechuun waa'ee ofii illee hin yaadu.
I want to go back up there.	Achitti ol deebi'uu barbaada.
It's not really about him.	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa miti.
But they had to do this.	Isaan garuu kana gochuu qabu turan.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
I can't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin danda'u.
No more, no more.	Kana booda hin jiru, hin jiru.
Everyone seems to know everything about everyone else.	Namni hundi waa'ee nama hundumaa waan hunda waan beeku fakkaata.
I am in trouble.	Ani rakkoo keessa jira.
We didn’t become.	Nuti hin taane.
Looks good so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii fakkaata.
He was a man.	Inni nama ture.
Not sure the person meant anything bad to him.	Namni sun waan hamaa itti jechuu akka ture mirkanaa'aa miti.
He even had to scream over that voice.	Sagalee sana irra iyyuu qaba ture.
That was their business.	Sun dhimma isaanii ture.
It doesn’t make it easy.	Salphaa hin godhu.
But it doesn’t work this way.	Garuu karaa kanaan hin hojjetu.
It’s not a time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu miti.
We need to do this.	Kana gochuu qabna.
It was a great day.	Guyyaa guddaa ture.
Something even better may be at work.	Wanti kana caalaa gaarii taʼe tokko hojii irra jiraachuu dandaʼa.
I couldn’t find him.	Isa argachuu hin dandeenye.
You have three.	Sadii qabda.
It’s extremely dangerous.	Garmalee balaa qaba.
This was my present.	Kun amma koo ture.
In broad daylight.	Guyyaa bal’aa keessatti.
They can be very good.	Isaan baayyee gaarii ta'uu danda'u.
They should have more.	Kana caalaa qabaachuu qabu.
I didn’t want her to do this.	Akka isheen kana gootu hin barbaanne.
Even this is not enough.	Kun illee gahaa miti.
If then and .	Yoo sana booda fi .
He didn't see us.	Nu hin argine.
If no one sees him.	Yoo namni isa hin argine.
I mean, the truth.	Dhugaa jechuu kooti.
They all want to be in your place.	Hundi isaanii bakka kee ta'uu barbaadu.
I don't know when.	Yoom hin beeku.
But there are people out there who need help.	Garuu namoonni gargaarsa argachuu qaban ala jiru.
This was a great time.	Yeroon kun yeroo guddaa ture.
But this time that doesn’t work.	Garuu yeroo kana sun hin hojjetu.
There were many people doing this, not just one.	Kana kan gochaa turan nama hedduu ture malee tokko qofa miti.
Of course, that could still be the case.	Sun ammallee akkas ta’uu akka danda’u beekamaadha.
That was quite extraordinary.	Sun baayʼee waan adda taʼe ture.
One saw a house.	Tokko mana tokko arge.
Nothing special.	Wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
She was the mother of three children.	Haadha ijoollee sadii turte.
You don’t need that.	Sana si hin barbaachisu.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
That wasn’t necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa hin turre.
I didn't know what had happened.	Waan ta'e hin beeku ture.
He certainly wasn’t in any trouble.	Rakkoo tokkollee keessa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
It was very different.	Baayyee adda ture.
Such a thing is possible.	Wanti akkasii ni danda'ama.
It was a joke on the spot.	Bakka sanatti qoosaa ture.
If you don’t think about it, you’re not going to help her.	Yoo itti hin yaadne ishee gargaaruuf hin deemne.
No one had ever done that before.	Kanaan dura namni akkas godhe hin beeku.
Only I can do it.	Kan gochuu danda'u ana qofa.
It’s nothing but yourself and what you want to do.	Ofii fi waan hojjechuu barbaaddu malee homaa miti.
I'm not a lot of people.	Ani namoota baay'ee miti.
This is one of the few.	Kun muraasa keessaa isa tokko.
All but three of them.	Sadii malee hundi isaanii.
But that didn’t quite happen.	Garuu sun guutummaatti hin taane.
But he accepted it.	Inni garuu fudhate.
That's what he says.	Wanti inni jedhu akkas ta'a.
Maybe this is possible.	Tarii kun ni danda'ama ta'a.
That and that someone was with me.	Sana fi akka namni na waliin ture.
Tell me the truth.	Dhugaa jiru natti himi.
Every little bit of it.	Xiqqoo isaa hunda.
So he wasn’t the only one.	Kanaaf isa qofa hin turre.
No one knew where he was.	Eessa akka jiru namni beeku hin turre.
He had a house there.	Achitti mana qaba ture.
They certainly aren’t.	Isaan akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Not sure about that.	Waa'ee kanaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
He doesn’t look good.	Inni gaarii hin fakkaatu.
I would say, not quite.	Ani akkan jedhu, guutummaatti miti.
Something seemed different.	Wanti tokko adda ta'e fakkaata ture.
And I went out.	Anis ba'e.
Not even for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf illee miti.
Now you know why.	Amma maaliif akka ta'e beekta.
He was the only one.	Inni qofa ture.
But that's not all.	Garuu wanti kana qofa miti.
There is no reason to stay.	Sababni itti turuuf hin jiru.
It just never happened that way.	Akkasitti ta'ee hin beeku qofa.
Now, everything’s clear.	Amma, wanti hundi ifa ta’e.
This was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ture.
But she was here now.	Isheen garuu amma as turte.
There is no problem there.	Achitti rakkoon hin jiru.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
Just too many of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee qofa.
I couldn’t have one.	Tokko qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
Then the men spoke no more.	Sana booda namoonni sun kana booda hin dubbanne.
None of that happened.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin taane.
He knew there was another.	Kan biraa akka jiru beeka ture.
One to help yourself.	Tokko of gargaaruuf.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
This may not be enough.	Kun gahaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I really think people haven't thought about that yet.	Dhuguma namoonni hanga ammaatti waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne jedheen yaada.
But it almost never happens.	Garuu gonkumaa hin ta'u jechuun ni danda'ama.
I didn’t want this for you.	Kana siif hin barbaanne.
I used to go to this school.	Duraan mana barumsaa kana nan deema ture.
I mean, just completely.	Guutummaatti qofa jechuu kooti.
I don’t have a chance.	Carraa hin qabu.
Certainly not the case here.	Asitti akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Except for his daughter.	Intala isaa malee.
He looked older than usual.	Inni yeroo biraa caalaa umuriin isaa guddaa fakkaata ture.
But we only have time.	Garuu yeroo qofa qabna.
It won't happen anymore.	Kana booda hin ta'u.
It is not self-knowledge.	Irraa of beekuu miti.
It’s a good feeling.	Miira gaarii dha.
But it’s not going to help.	Garuu gargaaruuf hin deemu.
I want her to think about her.	Waa'ee ishee akka yaaddu nan barbaada.
Wait a little longer.	Xiqqoo eegaa.
I came up with just him.	Isa qofa jedheen dhufe.
It was much more than that, of course.	Kana caalaa baay’ee akka ture beekamaadha.
Often, this is possible.	Yeroo baay’ee, kun ni danda’ama.
In this he is right.	Kana keessatti inni sirrii dha.
I like it very much.	Baayyee natti tola.
Even during the day.	Guyyaa illee.
Look at the real problem.	Rakkoo dhugaa jiru ilaalaa.
They really loved each other.	Dhuguma wal jaallatu turan.
It can't be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
So it wasn’t even a question.	Kanaaf gaaffii illee hin turre.
I was in them.	Ani isaan keessa ture.
I want to talk about hope.	Waa'ee abdii dubbachuu barbaada.
Everything seems to be going well.	Wanti hundi gaarii waan deemu fakkaata.
I have a lot of work to do today.	Har'a hojiin baay'een qaba.
But I never knew that.	Garuu gonkumaa akkasitti hin beeku.
I wanted to go back in time.	Yeroo kootti deebi'uu barbaade.
But that was good enough.	Garuu sun gaarii gahaa ture.
Nothing can be right without her.	Ishee malee wanti sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
One shoe.	Kophee tokko.
I knew it was really none of my business.	Dhuguma dhimma koo akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
Then right into you.	Sana booda sirriitti si keessa.
He has a dog.	Saree qaba.
She had some of these.	Isaan kana keessaa tokko tokko qabdi turte.
Something told me she was into it.	Waan tokko akka isheen keessa jirtu natti hime.
People are not that different.	Namoonni hangas adda miti.
She couldn't believe this was happening.	Kun ta'aa jira jettee amanuu hin dandeenye.
What can be done?	Maal gochuun ni danda’ama?
None of this would go well.	Kun tokkollee akka gaariitti hin deemu ture.
You need to do something about that.	Sana irratti waan tokko gochuu qabda.
I had been waiting for her all day.	Guyyaa guutuu ishee eegaa ture.
Good luck in your new situation.	Haala haaraa keessan keessatti carraa gaarii.
Sorry about that.	Waa'ee kanaa dhiifama.
None of that happened though.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin taane garuu.
We all need to work together.	Hundi keenya waliin hojjechuu qabna.
That’s not what she does.	Kan isheen gootu akkas miti.
But that's it.	Garuu kanuma.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
We have no answers as to how and why this happened.	Kun akkamitti fi maaliif akka ta'e deebii hin qabnu.
No one had seen him.	Namni isa arge hin jiru ture.
He knew we had him.	Isa akka qabnu ni beeka ture.
We do nothing to help our situation.	Haala keenya gargaaruuf homaa hin goonu.
Perhaps it is not necessary to do so.	Tarii akkas gochuun barbaachisaa miti.
Maybe you can help us.	Tarii nu gargaaruu dandeessu ta'a.
But he wants the food.	Garuu nyaata sana barbaada.
It went really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti deeme.
You know there's a chance you might not come back.	Deebi'uu dhiisuu akka dandeessu carraan akka jiru ni beekta.
It was my job.	Hojii koo ture.
They have to do what is important.	Waan barbaachisaa ta'e hojjechuu qabu.
This cannot be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin danda'u.
But tell me about yourself.	Garuu waa'ee kee natti himi.
There was still a chance.	Ammas carraan ture.
I didn't want to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin barbaanne.
Great great great.	Guddaa guddaa guddaa.
You are very special .	Baayyee adda taate .
That was tomorrow.	Sun boru ture.
I want to know if that is the case.	Akkas ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa beekuu barbaada.
But they’re not the only ones.	Garuu isaan qofa miti.
But there is no boy.	Garuu gurbaa hin jiru.
Does anyone have any idea what is going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru namni yaada qabu jiraa.
Only when needed.	Yeroo barbaachisu qofa.
It's exactly right.	Sirriitti sirrii dha.
You have to help.	Gargaaruu qabda.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
He will always be there.	Yeroo hundumaa ni jiraata.
I’m never in a car.	Ani gonkumaa konkolaataa keessa hin jiru.
I need you to do me a favor.	Tola akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa.
They were loud.	Sagalee guddaa qaban turan.
But they are there.	Garuu isaan achi jiru.
This one seemed different.	Inni kun garuu adda fakkaata ture.
This currently works.	Kun yeroo ammaa kana ni hojjeta.
Look at her.	Ishee ilaalaa.
That's why they say.	Kanaaf jedhu.
We still have a little time.	Ammallee yeroo xiqqoo qabna.
It's going now.	Amma deemaa jira.
I think this is just great.	Kun waan guddaa qofa natti fakkaata.
In that, but not in everything else.	Sana keessatti, garuu waan hundumaa keessatti miti.
By then it was night.	Yeroo sanatti halkan ta'e.
There could have been.	Silaa jiraachuu danda'a ture.
Sorry there was a problem.	Dhiifama rakkoon ture.
You can have children.	Ijoollee qabaachuu dandeessa.
I suggest that it could be much more.	Kana caalaa baay’ee ta’uu akka danda’u yaada kooti.
I would have just met her.	Silaa ishee waliin wal arguu qofa ture.
Something like that happens.	Wanti akkasii ni ta'a.
But all we can do is do our best.	Garuu wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu waan dandeenyu hunda gochuu qofa.
Just that it’s dangerous.	Balaa akka qabu qofa.
She had no desire to call it specific.	Fedhii adda ta'e jedhu hin qabdu turte.
He got it wrong.	Inni dogoggora argate.
I have to say.	Jechuun qaba.
It could be a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
They could be me.	Isaan ana ta'uu danda'u.
He works on it.	Inni irra hojjeta.
What could it be.	Maal ta'uu danda'a.
I don’t need that work that much.	Hojiin sun hangas na hin barbaachisu.
We have the right people.	Namoota sirrii qabna.
This was not my idea.	Kun yaada koo hin turre.
Nobody does this in real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti namni kana godhu hin jiru.
There is no right or wrong.	Sirrii fi dogoggora hin jiru.
He knows what really happened.	Dhuguma maaltu akka taʼe ni beeka.
I should never have come here.	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture.
If it comes out.	Yoo ba'e.
But there’s nothing you can do about it.	Garuu wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
He's waiting for me.	Na eegaa jira.
Today, everyone does everything.	Har'a namni hundi waan hunda hojjeta.
That’s just me.	Sun ana qofa.
Everyone wants to do more.	Namni hundi kana caalaa hojjechuu barbaada.
He knew what he had in his wife.	Waan haadha manaa isaa keessa qabu ni beeka ture.
It was just the time.	Yeroon isaa qofa ture.
I want this.	Ani kana barbaada.
I never know what more to say about her.	Waa'ee ishee kana caalaa maal akkan jedhu gonkumaa hin beeku.
We still have feelings.	Ammallee miira qabna.
He just looked at her.	Ishee qofa ilaale.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Waan beekuu qabu hunda beeka ture.
In her father's house.	Mana abbaa ishee keessatti.
When you do, I can't go wrong.	Yeroo gootu dogoggora deemuu hin danda'u.
I have a lot to tell you.	Waan baay'een sitti himu qaba.
I wanted to ask you about that.	Waa'ee sanaa si gaafachuu barbaade.
I am not one of those people.	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko miti.
I don't want that either.	Anis akkas hin barbaadu.
She stayed with me all day.	Guyyaa guutuu na waliin turte.
He looks great.	Inni guddaa fakkaata.
So that doesn’t work.	Kanaaf sun hin hojjetu.
I have no hope that this will work.	Kun akka hojjetu abdii hin qabu.
I know better now.	Amma caalaatti beeka.
That didn’t happen this time.	Yeroo kana akkas hin taane.
This was a very serious problem.	Kun rakkoo baayyee hamaa ture.
So good for you!!.	Kanaaf siif gaarii!!.
I just can't believe it.	Ani qofa amanuu hin danda'u.
But everything will be fine.	Garuu wanti hundi gaarii ta'a.
He’s just that kind of guy.	Inni gurbaa akkasii qofa.
That can't be good.	Sun gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I didn’t understand the question.	Gaaffii sana hin hubanne.
But what can they really say.	Garuu dhuguma maal jechuu danda'u.
That seemed like a great opportunity.	Sun carraa guddaa fakkaata ture.
It doesn’t matter what you think.	Waan ati yaaddu homaa hin qabu.
They were on the road.	Karaa irra turan.
It was a great job.	Hojii guddaa ture.
I thought we did a really good job.	Dhuguma hojii gaarii hojjenne jedheen yaade.
I was only there one night.	Halkan tokko qofa achi ture.
That’s got to be good.	Sun gaarii ta’uu qaba ture.
Simple and good.	Salphaa fi gaarii.
But it's not about that.	Garuu waa'ee kanaa miti.
I think you can’t do that.	Akkas gochuu hin dandeessu jedheen yaada.
He went in the night.	Halkan keessa deeme.
It is a book.	Kitaaba tokko dha.
I couldn’t see anymore.	Kana booda arguu hin dandeenye.
She really didn’t need it.	Dhuguma ishee hin barbaachifne.
I love the sound of it.	Sagalee isaa baay'een jaalladha.
You know me better than that.	Ati kana caalaa na beekta.
Now that doesn’t matter.	Amma sun homaa hin qabu.
I have to go now.	Amma deemuun qaba.
Maybe it's too much.	Tarii garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
We have to do this every morning!.	Ganama ganama kana gochuu qabna!.
I don't know anything.	Ani homaa hin beeku.
There were a lot of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee turan.
It should be more specific.	Caalaatti adda ta'uu qaba.
I know that it is.	Akka ta'e nan beeka.
It would have been nice.	Silaa gaarii ture.
I doubt that will happen.	Sun akka ta'u nan shakka.
They are my friends.	Hiriyyoota kooti.
We’re going to go.	Deemaa jirra.
You have to know everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu qabda.
There were too many of them.	Garmalee baay'ee turan.
I don't need your forgiveness.	Dhiifama keessan hin barbaadu.
There seems to be a lot we don't know about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beekne waan jiru fakkaata.
He knew he had to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
He is good with his hands.	Harka isaatiin gaarii dha.
They are all different.	Hundi isaanii adda adda.
That's what we did.	Akkas goone.
Clearly, it is not.	Akka hin taane ifaadha.
But it was so obvious, no one wanted it.	Garuu akkas ifa ture, namni barbaadu hin jiru.
I go to school.	Mana barumsaa nan deema.
Through good times, and bad.	Karaa yeroo gaarii, fi hamaa.
Not exactly an idea of ​​why.	Maaliif sirriitti yaada miti.
We are no different than anyone else.	Nuti nama biraa irraa adda miti.
Which I love.	Kan ani jaalladhu.
Her old self.	Ofii ishee durii.
That looks really good.	Sun dhuguma gaarii fakkaata.
This didn’t even seem like it.	Kun illee hin fakkaatu ture.
Can you give me a hand?	Harka naaf kennuu dandeessaa?
So long time.	Kanaaf yeroo dheeraa.
This is not such a thing.	Kun waan akkasii miti.
Just that it was a bad time for me.	Yeroon sun naaf yeroo hamaa akka ta'e qofa.
It wasn’t on them.	Isaan irratti hin turre.
In the present moment.	Yeroo ammaa kana keessatti.
When you talk about .	Yeroo ati waa'ee .
I wanted to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu barbaade.
It wasn’t completely.	Guutummaatti hin turre.
Not that day.	Guyyaa sana miti.
I have no interest.	Fedhii hin qabu.
I'm all about matters.	Hundi koo dhimma qaba.
We are on the road.	Karaa irra jirra.
Whatever comes to you is nothing.	Wanti siif dhufe homaa miti.
A month, not a month.	Ji'a osoo hin taane ji'a tokko.
You can come here.	Asitti dhufuu dandeessu.
Someone was inside me.	Namni tokko na keessa ture.
It’s just school.	Mana barumsaa qofa.
I can't tell you more.	Kana caalaa himuu hin danda'u.
I need help with this.	Kana irratti gargaarsa barbaachisa.
These were things he knew.	Kun wantoota inni beeku turan.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
I was just here.	Ani as ture qofa.
I can't tell you right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sitti himuu hin danda'u.
Her whole life.	Jireenya ishee guutuu.
He didn’t stay there long.	Yeroo dheeraa achi hin turre.
You should stop doing that.	Sana gochuu dhiisuu qabda.
I think you know something.	Waan tokko waan beektu natti fakkaata.
That wouldn't be easy.	Sun salphaa hin ta'u ture.
I don't know if that matters to you.	Sun siif barbaachisaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
So he had to give it	Kanaaf kennuu qaba ture
This one will be different this time though.	Inni kun yeroo kana garuu adda ta'a.
Your hands are just what happened.	Harka kee waan ta'e qofa.
This rarely works.	Kun yeroo muraasaaf hojjeta.
I had no idea what to do!	Maal akkan godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture!
But that's how it happened.	Garuu akkas ta'e.
It was a great place to work.	Bakka hojii guddaa ture.
The people you love.	Namoota ati jaallattu.
It's all happening.	Hundi isaa ta'aa jira.
There must be someone else.	Namni biraa jiraachuu qaba.
I didn’t know she would do that.	Akka isheen akkas gootu hin beeku ture.
We didn't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu turre.
In this case, however, it is completely different.	Haala kana keessatti garuu, guutummaatti adda taʼa.
They’re not that bad.	Isaan hangas hamaa miti.
Again, too long .	Ammas, garmalee dheeraa .
Anymore.	Kana caalaa.
You can do better than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa.
It wasn’t all that bad.	Akka sana hunda hamaa hin turre.
It had to be work, school.	Hojii, mana barumsaa ta'uu qaba ture.
He’s just himself.	Inni ofii isaa qofa.
So another time.	Kanaaf yeroo biraa.
I hadn’t noticed it before.	Kanaan dura hin hubanne ture.
We can’t do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
No one was happy about it.	Namni itti gammade hin jiru.
I do like this one some.	Ani akka isa kanaa tokko tokko nan godha.
It could be his, it could be yours.	Kan isaa ta'uu danda'a, kan kee ta'uu danda'a.
He still lives there.	Ammallee achi jiraata.
It was an important job.	Hojii barbaachisaa ture.
But there are.	Garuu ni jiru.
No one had it.	Namni tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I don't think he's right.	Inni sirrii natti hin fakkaatu.
It was a completely different life.	Jireenya guutummaatti adda taʼe ture.
There is no other way to do this.	Kana karaa biraa hin jiru.
Clearly, this was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora akka ture ifaadha.
I don't understand how.	Akkamitti naaf hin galle.
Not much different from being at home then.	Yeroo sanatti mana jiraachuu irraa baayyee adda miti.
He was right.	Inni sirrii ture.
He was hers.	Inni kan ishee ture.
They had to be very long, really.	Baayyee dheeraa ta’uu qabu turan, dhuguma.
That’s how it is.	Akkasitti jira.
He seems to have done this again.	Ammas waan kana godhe fakkaata.
This is my area.	Kun naannoo kooti.
That's how it goes.	Akkasitti deema.
Sometimes there are three.	Yeroo tokko tokko sadii ta’u.
You can have a house.	Mana qabaachuu dandeessa.

I didn't agree.	Anis walii hin galle.
He thought he had done it.	Inni waan godhe itti fakkaate.
He wanted to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjechuu barbaade.
But it was like that.	Garuu akkas ture.
It happens, it happens, it happens.	Ni ta'a, ni ta'a, ta'aa jira.
It was something else.	Waan biraa ture.
That was a lot.	Sun baay'ee ture.
You have that opportunity.	Carraa sana qabda.
It was then.	Yeroo sana ture.
We are looking for a new job.	Hojii haaraa barbaadaa jirra.
But it was good.	Garuu gaarii ture.
Have a nice year.	Bara gaarii.
I just couldn’t believe myself.	Of amanuu qofa hin dandeenye.
Everything here was, is.	Wanti as jiru hundi ture, jira.
Too much going on, too much to do.	Garmalee deemaa jiru, baay'ee hojjechuuf.
Just in the room.	Kutaa keessa qofa.
We have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabna.
She certainly didn’t leave.	Isheen akka hin deemne beekamaadha.
I know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e nan beeka.
This was a great thing.	Kun waan guddaa ture.
You can get it.	Argachuu dandeessu.
It’s just too much work.	Hojii garmalee qofa.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
They could not walk well alone.	Kophaa isaanii akka gaariitti deemuu hin dandeenye.
That should do the job.	Sun hojii sana hojjechuu qaba.
Now go back home.	Amma gara manaatti deebi'i.
He's waiting for you.	Si eegaa jira.
More in a moment.	Yeroo muraasa keessatti kana caalaa.
Very few people have that kind of life.	Namoonni jireenya akkasii qaban baayyee muraasa.
I can't see my kids now.	Amma ijoollee koo arguu hin danda'u.
I certainly saw theirs.	Kan isaanii akkan arge beekamaadha.
We need new ways.	Karaa haaraa nu barbaachisa.
You just have this feeling.	Miira kana qofa qabda.
That’s not great.	Sun guddaa miti.
What he’s doing, no one else is doing.	Waan inni hojjechaa jiru, namni biraa hin hojjetu.
So he’s a good guy.	Kanaaf inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
That should happen soon.	Sun yeroo dhiyootti ta'uu qaba.
Excuse me, can you help me?	Dhiifama na gargaaruu dandeessaa?
It occurred to him that he could ask.	Gaafachuu akka danda'u itti dhufe.
The sound of her voice.	Sagalee sagalee ishee.
But that shouldn't be the case.	Garuu sun ta'uu hin qabu.
That’s the other thing.	Kan biraa kanuma.
Hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Kun akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
He didn't.	Hin goone.
But that’s not the case anymore.	Garuu kana booda akkas miti.
It certainly looks like that.	Akkas akka fakkaatu beekamaadha.
I was completely alone.	Guutummaatti kophaa koo ture.
It wasn’t on anything.	Homaa irra hin turre.
It's not the same thing.	Waan tokko miti.
They were people once, just a very long time ago.	Isaan yeroo tokko namoota turan, yeroo baayyee dheeraa dura qofa.
They currently have one person.	Yeroo ammaa kana nama tokko qabu.
I’ll say it again, just.	Ammas nan jedha, qofa.
I can do that, she said.	Ani akkas gochuu nan danda'a jette.
This was great.	Kun guddaa ture.
I really don’t know what to do.	Dhuguma maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
It was a completely new concept in those days.	Bara sanatti yaada guutummaatti haaraa ture.
Maybe it's an accident.	Tarii balaa ta'uu danda'a.
There was so much she didn't know.	Waan baay'ee isheen hin beekne baay'ee ture.
I love that dress.	Uffata sana nan jaalladha.
But he knew better than to ask.	Garuu gaafachuu caalaa beeka ture.
I would say, not quite.	Ani akkan jedhu, guutummaatti miti.
It really doesn’t help.	Dhuguma hin gargaaru.
This must be the reason.	Sababni kun ta'uu qaba.
But now it's different.	Amma garuu adda ta'e.
He obviously didn’t think about this.	Kana akka itti hin yaadne ifaadha.
Some good times though.	Yeroo gaarii tokko tokko garuu.
I am one.	Ani tokko.
Did a few things, but not much.	Waan muraasa hojjete, garuu baay'ee miti.
I'll go to him.	Isa bira nan deema.
I can't stay for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf turuu hin danda'u.
You really need to know that.	Dhuguma sana beekuu qabda.
She has a bad reputation.	Maqaa hamaa qabdi.
That is not the case now.	Amma akkas miti.
A lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee.
Very good in response time.	Yeroo deebii kennuu keessatti baayyee gaarii dha.
This is a good opportunity.	Kun carraa gaarii dha.
He is my dog.	Inni saree kooti.
That is probably not the case.	Sun taʼuu hin oolu.
He knew, not me.	Inni beeka ture malee ana miti.
The task had taken longer than he expected.	Hojiin sun yeroo inni yaade caalaa yeroo fudhate ture.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a.
It doesn’t work well.	Akka gaariitti hin hojjetu.
This here, there and there.	Kun asitti, achi fi achi.
He didn't need one.	Tokko isa hin barbaachifne.
There was an exception in this.	Kana keessatti wanti ala ta’e tokko ture.
Why it should be.	Maaliif ta'uu qaba.
I must be different.	Anis adda ta'uu qaba.
This couldn't be right.	Kun sirrii ta'uu hin dandeenye.
It’s just not right.	Sirrii miti qofa.
It’s not his way.	Karaa isaa miti.
She needs a drink.	Dhugaatii ishee barbaachisa.
Which he didn't do.	Kan inni hin goone inni.
But you don’t want to help them.	Garuu isaan gargaaruu hin barbaaddu.
Not a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa miti.
She obviously loves her.	Ishee akka jaallattu ifaadha.
But it will be too late.	Garuu yeroon booda ta'a.
But you have it.	Garuu qabda.
I need it in life.	Jireenya keessatti na barbaachisa.
People are working.	Namoonni hojjechaa jiru.
But maybe not.	Tarii garuu hin ta'u ta'a.
He will live with us.	Nu waliin ni jiraata.
He could tell you the situation.	Haala keessa jiru sitti himuu dandaʼa ture.
It’s just work.	Hojii qofa.
It got out of my way.	Karaa koo keessaa ba'e.
You don’t understand.	Siif hin galle.
He was the one who was going to help me.	Kan na gargaaruuf deemu isa ture.
He certainly didn’t want to see her.	Ishee arguu akka hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
It’s just your job.	Hojii kee qofa.
He wants to see us.	Nu arguu ni barbaada.
He wasn't meant to be.	Inni akka ta'uuf hin turre.
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
That's how it worked.	Akkasitti hojjete.
I don't know if it's a question.	Gaaffii yoo ta'e hin beeku.
This is now.	Kun amma.
Walking alone is dangerous.	Kophaa deemuun balaa qaba.
You have ideas, you have answers.	Yaada qabda, deebii qabda.
It worked a lot.	Baay'ee hojjete.
You can even come with me.	Na waliin dhufuu illee dandeessa.
He wanted it to be just the two of them.	Isaan lamaan qofa akka ta'u barbaade.
He is neither here.	Inni lamaan isaaniiyyuu as hin jiru.
He used to live up there.	Duraan achi ol jiraata ture.
I mean, he really knows what he’s doing.	Waan hojjetu dhuguma beeka jechuu kooti.
There could be no other reason.	Sababni biraa jiraachuu hin danda’u ture.
It's just a feeling.	Miira qofa.
So we are looking for a name.	Kanaaf maqaa barbaadaa jirra.
He should have come sooner.	Silaa dafee dhufuu qaba ture.
She knew nothing about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beektu turte.
But nothing else, of course.	Garuu wanti biraa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He was her reason for being, her life’s work.	Inni sababa jiraachuu ishee, hojii jireenya ishee ture.
It wasn’t just a feeling.	Miira qofa hin turre.
So, there are .	Kanaaf, ni jiru .
Being too much.	Garmalee ta'uu.
There was nothing else to say.	Kan biraa wanti jedhu hin turre.
That was another life.	Sun jireenya biraa ture.
It was really you.	Dhuguma ati turte.
But that is not the case here.	Garuu asitti akkas miti.
They could have done that again.	Ammas silaa akkas gochuu danda’u turan.
Have a nice day for him.	Guyyaa gaarii isaaf.
Not that he thought it would be like that.	Akkas ta'a jedhee yaade miti.
He has been everywhere.	Bakka hunda tureera.
I don’t think it’s easy.	Salphaa natti hin fakkaatu.
We don’t need one.	Tokko nu hin barbaachisu.
I am happy to be here.	As jiraachuu kootti gammadeera.
It certainly wasn’t.	Akka hin turre beekamaadha.
But we don’t have them.	Garuu isaan hin qabnu.
Someone would definitely do it.	Namni tokko gochuun isaa hin oolu ture.
But not his eyes.	Garuu ija isaa miti.
He just really, really doesn’t care.	Inni dhuguma, dhuguma dhimma hin qabu qofa.
Today that is not true.	Har'a sun dhugaa miti.
Everything seemed to be in place.	Wanti hundi bakka isaa waan jiru fakkaata ture.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
That’s his problem, that’s not my problem.	Rakkoon isaa kanuma, rakkoon koo kanuma miti.
They need to get something from someone.	Nama tokko irraa waan tokko argachuu qabu.
He is not here.	Inni as hin jiru.
I knew it was true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture.
It wasn’t even my imagination.	Yaada koo illee hin turre.
He really thought about it.	Dhuguma itti yaade.
Good job.	Hojii gaarii.
But the time has passed.	Garuu yeroon darbe.
These men were with him.	Namoonni kun isa waliin turan.
We are completely ourselves.	Nuti guutummaatti ofii keenya.
I can't see it.	Arguu hin danda'u.
That’s her there.	Sun ishee achitti.
That says a lot.	Sun waan baay'ee dubbata.
What they contain.	Waan of keessaa qabu.
But we’re just friends.	Garuu nuti hiriyyoota qofa.
I can't say enough good things about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
He knows too much.	Garmalee beeka.
You are not in any trouble.	Rakkoo tokkollee keessa hin jirtu.
He went on again.	Ammas irra deeme.
It just doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u qofa.
This is not entirely true.	Kun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
All on its own.	Hundi ofuma isaatiin.
Everything was fine a few hours ago.	Sa'aatii muraasa dura wanti hundi gaarii ture.
I could be there with them.	Isaan waliin achi jiraachuu nan dandaʼa ture.
One bad moment.	Yeroo hamaa tokko.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
He was in a bad mood.	Miira hamaa keessa ture.
In this you are probably like many others.	Kana keessatti tarii akkuma namoota hedduu ta’uu dandeessa.
What was it like before?	Kanaan dura maal fakkaata ture?
He wasn’t exactly funny.	Inni sirriitti qoosaa hin turre.
Not much though.	Baay'ee miti garuu.
They hadn’t seen her.	Ishee hin argine turan.
We need a few things.	Wantoota muraasa nu barbaachisa.
But it couldn't have been easy.	Garuu salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
He had nothing to say about it.	Waa'ee kanaa waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
Wait and see with me.	Eegaa na waliin ilaalaa.
She said there was no one in the house.	Mana keessa namni hin jiru jette.
You can’t just do both.	Lamaan qofa hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
That was a great part.	Sun kutaa guddaa ture.
I had such a feeling it would be fine.	Miira akkasii qaba ture gaarii ta'a.
I could never walk again.	Kana booda gonkumaa deemuu hin dandeenye.
He was an important man among us.	Inni nu keessaa nama barbaachisaa ture.
He will eat it.	Inni ni nyaata.
If not, wait another day.	Yoo hin taane guyyaa biraa eegaa.
You knew me.	Ati na beekta turte.
It shouldn't be this bad.	Hamaa kana ta'uu hin qabu.
So, no more here.	Kanaaf, kana caalaa asitti hin jiru.
But look at everything that happened.	Garuu waan ta'e hunda ilaalaa.
Her hands.	Harka ishee.
He is a good man.	Inni nama gaarii dha.
He wasn't sure what it was but he knew it was dangerous.	Maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre garuu balaa akka qabu beeka ture.
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu akkas miti.
But this was my father.	Garuu kun abbaa koo ture.
He thought about it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf itti yaade.
He was right about that.	Waa'ee kanaa sirrii ture.
Then there’s me, of course.	Sana booda ani jira, beekamaadha.
Yours might be different.	Kan kee adda ta'uu danda'a.
This is no longer true.	Kun kana booda dhugaa miti.
You have to work with everybody.	Nama hunda waliin hojjechuu qabda.
But never this.	Garuu gonkumaa kana.
Not just a book, .	Kitaaba qofa osoo hin taane, .
This can go many ways.	Kun karaa hedduu deemuu danda’a.
I didn’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beeku ture.
I should have gone.	Silaa deemuun qaba ture.
It would be fine now.	Amma gaarii ta'a ture.
Our lives together.	Jireenya keenya waliin.
I couldn't tell him.	Itti himuu hin dandeenye.
I mean, I mean it.	Anis jechuu kooti.
It happened in the afternoon.	Waaree booda ta'e.
Better not have any kids.	Ijoollee tokkollee qabaachuu dhiisuu wayya.
He was no longer there.	Kana booda achi hin turre.
She was good to go.	Isheen deemuun ishee gaarii ture.
She did that, you know.	Isheen akkas goote beekta.
Everything else worked.	Wanti biraa hundi hojjete.
But this was not the case.	Kun garuu hin turre.
It was her watch.	Sa'aatii ishee ture.
I was very excited.	Ani baay'ee gammade.
He has something to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu qaba.
He was right about that.	Waa'ee kanaa sirrii ture.
It wasn’t even my father.	Abbaa koo illee hin turre.
But that wasn’t the case here.	Garuu asitti akkas hin turre.
It may not just happen overnight .	Halkan tokko qofa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a .
Maybe there were some.	Tarii tokko tokko turan.
This is the biggest problem.	Rakkoo guddaa kana.
They are one truth.	Isaan dhugaa tokko.
He is usually right.	Yeroo baayʼee sirrii dha.
Not so much.	Hamma kana miti.
He walked right out of the room.	Kutaa sana keessaa sirriitti ba'e.
You think you’re all alone.	Hundi kee kophaa kee sitti fakkaata.
Only for a short time.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
But I like it a lot.	Garuu baay'ee natti tola.
Lots of problems.	Rakkoo baay'ee.
I don't know what that is.	Sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
They were once.	Yeroo tokko turan.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Just two simple people.	Namoota salphaa lama qofa.
I can't have you around now.	Amma naannoo kootti si qabaachuu hin danda'u.
Rarely did anyone else get a chance to speak.	Namni biraa carraa dubbachuu kan argate yeroo muraasa qofa ture.
I don’t know what to make of that reality.	Dhugaa jiru sana maal akka godhu hin beeku.
He had a job to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
He doesn't have you.	Inni si hin qabu.
Is it still in place?	Ammallee bakka isaa jiraa?
That never happened before, so now they have more.	Duraan sun ta'ee hin beeku, kanaaf amma caalaatti qabu.
He should have done it.	Silaa gochuu qaba ture.
I am not myself right now.	Ani yeroo ammaa ofii koo miti.
No one has spoken.	Namni dubbate hin jiru.
This is not happening today.	Kun har'a ta'aa hin jiru.
I didn’t have enough time.	Yeroo gahaa hin qabu ture.
But there was hope.	Garuu abdiin ture.
If it's daytime, it's obvious.	Guyyaa yoo ta'e ifa dha.
That whole thing is so wrong wrong wrong.	Wanti sun hundi akkasitti dogoggora dogoggora dogoggora.
He said it was too much.	Garmalee akka ta'e jedhe.
He was so great to work with.	Inni baayyee guddaa ture waliin hojjechuuf.
He's doing fine now.	Amma gaarii hojjechaa jira.
One other time.	Yeroo biraa tokko.
But I think it’s good.	Garuu gaarii natti fakkaata.
So just wait for me.	Kanaaf na eegaa qofa.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
He realized his mistake.	Dogoggora isaa hubate.
You never know with a dog.	Saree waliin gonkumaa hin beektu.
He hadn’t seen her.	Inni ishee hin argine ture.
It was true.	Dhugaa ture.
Sometimes it is necessary.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni barbaachisa.
I am in this case.	Ani haala kana keessatti.
What set him apart, was what set him apart.	Kan adda isa godhe, waan adda isa godhe ture.
Not extensive at all.	Tasumaa bal'aa miti.
He is in a bad way.	Karaa hamaa keessa jira.
Sometimes, in the right circumstances, it can.	Yeroo tokko tokko, haala sirrii taʼe keessatti, ni dandaʼa.
But he knew that.	Inni garuu kana beeka ture.
I am really having this issue.	Dhuguma dhimma kana qabaa jira.
He didn't make a boy.	Gurbaa hin goone.
I do it often.	Yeroo baayʼee nan godha.
That is not right at all.	Sun tasumaa sirrii miti.
You can be different.	Adda ta'uu dandeessa.
She did everything she could.	Waan dandeessu hunda goote.
Now that seems to be in question.	Amma sun gaaffii keessa waan jiru fakkaata.
I am right and proper.	Ani sirrii fi sirrii dha.
They were working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa turan.
This didn’t work for me.	Kun naaf hin hojjenne.
I really don't know that much about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa hangas hin beeku.
I couldn’t do it much longer.	Kana caalaa yeroo dheeraaf gochuu hin dandeenye.
He stays home with them.	Isaan waliin mana taa'a.
He commented that it sounded great.	Sagalee guddaa akka qabu yaada kenne.
It wasn’t there before.	Duraan hin turre.
I was just his wife before.	Ani kanaan dura haadha manaa isaa qofa ture.
But now we don't have time.	Amma garuu yeroo hin qabnu.
Sorry, I can't.	Dhiifama, hin danda'u.
These are the ones.	Isaan kun.
I would be a good person though.	Ani garuu nama gaarii ta'a ture.
There is no such possibility.	Carraan akkasii hin jiru.
He was in enough danger.	Balaa gahaa keessa ture.
That was the big thing for us this week.	Torban kana waan guddaa nuuf ture kanuma.
He asked him the same question again.	Ammas gaaffii wal fakkaatu isa gaafate.
Usually no one was like that.	Yeroo baayyee namni akkas hin turre.
In the night,	Halkan keessa, .
He could have done better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandaʼa ture.
Sometimes that happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas taʼa.
But I don't have it.	Ani garuu hin qabu.
I didn't want this.	Ani kana hin barbaanne.
He must know.	Inni beekuu qaba.
This may help you.	Kun si gargaaru taʼa.
Those were the good old days.	Yeroon sun bara gaarii durii ture.
they should not have.	qabaachuu hin qaban.
Clearly, it is not.	Akka hin taane ifaadha.
They are not.	Isaan miti.
Anyone else still waiting?!?.	Namni biraa ammas eegaa jiru jiraa?!?.
He has been a bad boy.	Inni gurbaa hamaa ta'ee jira.
He was already a little different.	Inni duruu xiqqoo adda ture.
While saying that.	Osoo akkas jedhu.
I don't know who that could be.	Sun eenyu ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
All that money.	Maallaqa sana hunda.
He lives in the area.	Inni naannoo sana jiraata.
He had none of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It requires a sound.	Sagalee barbaada.
He said he didn't even know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e illee hin beeku jedhe.
He needs work.	Hojiin isa barbaachisa.
Two things about this.	Waa'ee kanaa waan lama.
I had no idea how he did it.	Akkamitti akka godhe yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
She had to know everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu qabdi turte.
Just everywhere.	Bakka hunda qofa.
Doing the work for you.	Hojii siif hojjechuu.
Perhaps there was something he could find.	Tarii wanti inni argachuu dandaʼu jiraachuu dandaʼa.
I don’t have that feeling at all.	Miira sana tasumaa hin qabu.
Just a necessary condition.	Haala barbaachisaa qofa.
Another little girl.	Intala xiqqoo kan biraa.
It's just happening.	Ta'aa jira qofa.
Wait for it.	Eegaa.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
Work, sleep at school.	Hojii, hirriba mana barumsaa.
Then it became clear again.	Sana booda ammas ifa ta'e.
You certainly don’t need to respond.	Deebii kennuu akka hin barbaachifne beekamaadha.
This doesn't seem to have happened.	Kun waan ta'e hin fakkaatu.
There needs to be more of that time.	Yeroon sun caalaatti jiraachuu qaba.
This is fascinating.	Kun namatti tola.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
A little girl.	Intala xiqqoo tokko.
I don’t need that this morning.	Ganama kana sun na hin barbaachisu.
But we did it.	Garuu ni goone.
We were together almost all the time.	Yeroo hunda jechuun ni danda'ama waliin turre.
I just didn’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan kana godhu qofa hin beeku ture.
It was something.	Waan tokko ture.
It’s not you.	Ati miti.
Someone had to tell the truth about what happened.	Namni tokko waan ta'e dhugaa dubbachuu qaba ture.
Look at me.	Na ilaalaa.
We must do our best.	Waan dandeenyu hunda gochuu qabna.
This was still happening.	Kun ammallee ta'aa ture.
I knew it would never work.	Yoomiyyuu akka hin hojjenne nan beeka ture.
Not much anymore.	Kana booda baay'ee miti.
It would never have worked.	Silaa gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
You have so many questions, don't you?	Gaaffii baay'ee qabda mitii?
He didn’t understand me at all.	Tasumaa na hin hubanne.
I think I'm saying something.	Waan waanan jedhu natti fakkaata.
I would have had to go.	Silaa deemuun dirqama ture.
It wasn’t all good.	Hundi gaarii hin turre.
But there is a problem with that.	Sana garuu rakkoon jira.
No reversing lights.	Ifa duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
I hesitated in the doorway.	Balbala keessaa duubatti jedheen.
It was long, but not long enough.	Dheeraa ture, garuu dheeraa gahaa hin turre.
It's been three months now.	Amma ji'a sadii.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
There is work.	Hojiin jira.
Picture of the week.	Suuraa torban kanaa.
My man is	Namni koo .
But something else.	Garuu waan biraa.
She didn't know.	Hin beektu turte.
It wasn't, though.	Hin turre garuu.
You may know.	Beektu taʼa.
It wasn’t in her place.	Bakka ishee hin turre.
I wanted no part of it.	Kutaa isaa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
Stay.	Turuu.
All of you are all the same.	Hundi keessan hundi keessan wal fakkaata.
He should live for three days.	Guyyaa sadii jiraachuu qaba.
If so, you obviously don't know her well.	Yoo akkas ta'e sirriitti akka ishee hin beekne ifaadha.
That’s the only time.	Yeroon sun qofa.
He had to be interested.	Fedhii qabaachuu qaba ture.
It was all he could do.	Inni waan inni gochuu dandaʼu hunda ture.
I didn’t want to tell anyone.	Namatti himuu hin barbaanne.
This was very wrong for him.	Kun baay'ee isaaf dogoggora ture.
Clearly, this is not a working day.	Kun guyyaa hojii akka hin taane ifaadha.
We have a lot in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu hedduu qabna.
What was, and still is.	Wanti ture, ammas jira.
There is nothing else.	Kanaan ala hin jiru.
Certainly not his own.	Kan isaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Not like me.	Akka koo miti.
He says you are still here.	Ammas as jirta jedha.
I can't say how we met.	Akkamitti akka wal argine dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I want him to really think about my question.	Gaaffii koo irratti dhuguma akka yaadu nan barbaada.
You just need to be you.	Si ta'uu qofa si barbaachisa.
It will be a new name.	Maqaa haaraa ta'a.
Which is extremely bad.	Kan garmalee hamaa ta'e.
Of course, you cannot do that.	Kana gochuu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
It seemed like a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa fakkaata ture.
Maybe we are.	Tarii nuti.
He has a great car.	Konkolaataa guddaa qaba.
I don’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
That’s not it.	Kana miti.
But of course that was something very different.	Garuu sun waan baay’ee adda ta’e akka ture beekamaadha.
I mean well, I mean.	Akka gaariitti jechuu kooti.
In her hands.	Harka ishee keessa.
You know you love it.	Akka jaallattu ni beekta.
You have to eat now.	Amma nyaachuu qabda.
All the same, it wasn't exactly clear what was going on.	Hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu, waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti ifa hin turre.
I can help you out.	Gargaaruu nan danda'a.
I didn't think much of it.	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
He should have left it there.	Silaa achitti dhiisuu qaba ture.
But there is none of that.	Garuu sun tokkollee hin jiru.
He’s just great.	Inni guddaa qofa.
It doesn’t go well.	Akka gaariitti hin deemu.
I wish it was, but it just doesn't happen.	Osoo ta'ee gaarii ture, garuu hin ta'u qofa.
But he wanted more.	Garuu kana caalaa barbaade.
We can’t get it.	Argachuu hin dandeenyu.
No one knew we were there.	Achi akka turre namni beeku hin turre.
She was in a room.	Kutaa tokko keessa turte.
It had really happened.	Dhuguma ta'ee ture.
Nothing was happening.	Homaa ta'aa hin turre.
I really didn’t want anything more.	Dhuguma kana caalaa waanan barbaadu hin turre.
But I will do it for you outside.	Ani garuu ala siif godha.
You will definitely go.	Deemuun keessan hin oolu.
Everything is nothing.	Wanti hundi homaa miti.
Really love it.	Dhuguma jaalladhu.
He was not a great excuse maker.	Inni nama sababa guddaa godhu hin turre.
Nothing like that happens.	Wanti akkasii hin ta'u.
I was so happy to be back.	Deebi'uu kootti baay'ee gammade.
Except today.	Har'a malee.
It's only going to be more.	Kana caalaa ta'uuf qofa deema.
He thought he did a pretty good job in the situation.	Haala keessa hojii baayyee gaarii hojjete itti fakkaate.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin qabu ture.
You can’t leave us.	Nu dhiisuu hin dandeessu.
I love you more than life.	Jireenya caalaa si jaalladha.
But it wasn't about him.	Garuu waa'ee isaa hin turre.
But this was too much even for him.	Garuu kun isaaf illee baay'ee ture.
He would never do it.	Inni gonkumaa hin godhu ture.
If it works, that’s fine.	Yoo hojjete gaarii dha.
I don’t know how he found me.	Akkamitti akka na argate hin beeku.
All morning there.	Ganama guutuu achitti.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
This shouldn't have happened.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I can do better than you.	Si caalaa gochuu nan danda'a.
It says a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee dubbata.
You need it.	Si barbaachisa.
They could see him.	Isa arguu dandaʼu turan.
Still, she was the only one he got.	Ammas kan inni argate ishee qofa ture.
For his help.	Gargaarsa isaaf.
But they’re not the whole picture.	Garuu isaan suuraa guutuu miti.
Just like we did.	Akkuma nuti goone.
It is our duty.	Dirqama keenya.
But this time it didn't.	Yeroo kana garuu hin taane.
You can find it here.	As keessaa argachuu dandeessu.
Nobody really wants to do that.	Namni dhuguma akkas gochuu barbaadu hin jiru.
Like father, like daughter.	Akka abbaa, akka intala.
But that’s not enough for us.	Garuu sun nuuf gahaa miti.
It's a good one.	Kan gaarii dha.
About a lot of things.	Waa'ee waan baay'ee.
You have to eat first.	Dura nyaata nyaachuu qabda.
I am not one of those people.	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko miti.
You can talk to me.	Natti dubbachuu dandeessa.
Someone must.	Namni tokko dirqama.
Maybe he was just being himself.	Tarii ofii isaa qofa ta'aa ture ta'a.
In this case it will.	Haala kana keessatti ni ta’a.
Two.	Lama.
You don’t have them.	Isaan hin qabdu.
There were three problems with this.	Kana irratti rakkoon sadii ture.
You need more than that.	Kana caalaa si barbaachisa.
I really didn’t want to be here.	Dhuguma as jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
None of which seemed true.	Isaan kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa hin fakkaatu ture.
He never looks like himself, of course.	Inni gonkumaa of hin fakkaatu, beekamaadha.
The thing is in the room with us.	Wanti nu waliin kutaa keessa jira.
He really is.	Inni dhuguma.
I haven’t yet, but I’m on my way.	Ammallee hin qabu, garuu karaa irra jira.
Then no one spoke again.	Sana booda namni ammas dubbate hin jiru.
But there is a problem.	Garuu rakkoon tokko jira.
Now he's looking at me.	Amma na ilaalaa jira.
It was more like daylight.	Caalaatti ifa guyyaa fakkaata ture.
Can't.	Hin danda'u.
He once owned a house.	Yeroo tokko mana qaba ture.
But you can see it.	Garuu arguu dandeessu.
There were just too many people.	Namoonni baay'ee qofa turan.
', was '.	', ture '.
Only a few.	Muraasa qofa.
Really good book.	Dhuguma kitaaba gaarii.
It can't be exactly what you want.	Sirriitti waan barbaaddu ta'uu hin danda'u.
But they can be very different.	Garuu baayyee adda ta'uu danda'u.
There is no problem.	Rakkoon tokkollee hin jiru.
But he didn’t mean that.	Garuu akkas jechuu hin barbaanne.
He seemed to want to tell us something.	Waan tokko nutti himuu waan barbaade fakkaata ture.
There's nothing he can do now.	Amma wanti inni gochuu danda'u hin jiru.
That was his only chance.	Carraan isaa kana qofa ture.
I couldn’t find her.	Ishee argachuu hin dandeenye.
They just tell you.	Isaan qofa sitti himu.
She was too young.	Isheen garmalee xiqqoo turte.
He was so perfectly happy.	Inni akkasitti guutummaatti gammade.
They always went to him.	Yeroo hundumaa gara isaa deemu turan.
I don't know what would have happened.	Silaa maaltu akka ta'u hin beeku.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
The task was not easy.	Hojiin sun salphaa hin turre.
It was like an accident.	Akka balaa ta'ee ture.
She hesitated for a moment before answering.	Deebii kennuu ishee dura yeroo muraasaaf duubatti jette.
One of my favorites.	Kan ani jaalladhu keessaa tokko.
Someone has to be an adult.	Namni tokko nama guddaa ta'uu qaba.
Larger than life.	Jireenya caalaa guddaa.
He has three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba.
Something no one here could do.	Waan namni as jiru tokkollee gochuu hin dandeenye.
This, however, is not a problem.	Kun garuu rakkoo hin qabu.
That’s not all.	Kanuma mitii.
One is the new one.	Tokko isa haaraa dha.
They are here to help.	Gargaaruuf as jiru.
He had little food.	Nyaata xiqqoo qaba ture.
Your whole life.	Jireenya kee guutuu.
He must have been an adult in this long.	Yeroo dheeraa kana keessatti nama guddaa ta'uu qaba.
But there is a new one.	Garuu kan haaraa ta'e tokko jira.
You can see it today.	Har'a arguu dandeessu.
But you don't.	Ati garuu hin gootu.
Today was our day.	Har'a guyyaa keenya ture.
As if it were.	Akka waan.
I couldn’t do otherwise.	Kanaan ala gochuu hin dandeenye.
I can't make it work for me.	Akka naaf hojjetu gochuu hin danda'u.
You said you might be right.	Sirrii ta'uu dandeessa jette.
It doesn't matter what the reason is.	Sababni isaa maal akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
He said so quickly.	Akkas dafee jedhe.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Tarii, tarii, tarii.
Maybe we should go.	Tarii deemuu qabna ta'a.
A stranger is walking down the street.	Namni hin beekne tokko karaa irra deemaa jira.
It gave me hope.	Abdii naaf kenne.
I need help.	Gargaarsa na barbaachisa.
But he is.	Garuu inni.
I really hope she does.	Akka isheen gootu dhuguma abdiin qaba.
I don’t know why they didn’t.	Maaliif akka hin goone hin beeku.
You guys are great.	Isin guddaa dha.
Together with together.	Waliin waliin.
He knew her well enough.	Inni akka gaariitti ishee beeka ture.
This is not good in our case.	Kun dhimma keenya keessatti gaarii miti.
But not in reality, perhaps.	Garuu dhugaa jiru keessatti akkas miti, tarii.
You have to live your life for you.	Jireenya kee siif jiraachuu qabda.
I didn’t intend to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf hin yaadne.
But I still can't believe it.	Garuu ammallee amanuu hin danda'u.
I had no idea what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
He saw the truth.	Dhugaa jiru arge.
We can’t stay here all night.	Halkan guutuu as turuu hin dandeenyu.
Having so much, but still having so little.	Waan baay'ee qabaachuu, garuu ammas xiqqoo qabaachuu.
He left the room.	Kutaa keessaa ba'e.
This is certainly not an easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He wants to live.	Jiraachuu barbaada.
He knew she was right.	Inni sirrii akka taate beeka ture.
But it’s not just work.	Garuu hojii qofa miti.
But this obviously doesn’t work.	Garuu kun akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
He has to talk to each other.	Waliin dubbachuu qaba.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
She didn't know who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beektu turte.
Something very dangerous.	Waan baayyee balaa qabu.
I mean, I'm the one.	Ana jechuu kooti.
He checked his watch again.	Ammas sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
Before, we were in it all the time.	Kanaan dura yeroo hunda keessa turre.
You don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabdu.
It doesn't seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu.
They need our help.	Gargaarsa keenya isaan barbaachisa.
Just like he did.	Akkuma inni godhe.
I thought you were someone else.	Ati nama biraa natti fakkaate.
Good job on this!.	Kana irratti hojii gaarii!.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
You might ask why.	Maaliif akka taʼe gaafachuu dandeessa.
She shouldn't have been outside.	Ala ta'uu hin qabdu turte.
You are very lucky.	Baayyee carraa qabda.
But he wasn’t looking at her.	Garuu ishee ilaalaa hin turre.
You can't be mine.	Ati kan koo ta'uu hin dandeessu.
They do, rather than.	Ni godhu, osoo hin taane.
He doesn't tell me anything.	Homaa natti hin himu.
No one knows her.	Namni ishee beeku hin jiru.
I'm the only one.	Ani qofa.
It was a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa ture.
But I can't see you today.	Har'a garuu si arguu hin danda'u.
They had no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban turan.
I will do that.	Ani akkas nan godha.
We didn’t have the time we needed.	Yeroo nu barbaachisu hin qabnu turre.
These people are right.	Namoonni kun sirrii dha.
I know him very well.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka.
That seems unlikely, however.	Sun garuu akkas akka hin taane fakkaata.
But I didn't want to talk about it that day.	Garuu guyyaa sana waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
It wasn’t working anymore.	Sana booda hojjechaa hin turre.
But it was ever so.	Garuu yoomiyyuu akkas ture.
But it is not necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa miti.
That had to feel good.	Sun miira gaarii qabaachuu qaba ture.
You are on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra jirta.
You weren’t there.	Ati achi hin turre.
So it took a long time.	Kanaaf yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
If you haven't seen him, you don't know him.	Yoo isa hin argine ta'e isa hin beektu.
Just like you didn’t.	Akkuma ati hin goone.
He certainly has to be.	Inni ta’uu akka qabu beekamaadha.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa kan hin turre.
Who would it be.	Silaa eenyu ta'a.
She doesn’t look well.	Isheen akka gaariitti hin fakkaattu.
He tried, he really did.	Inni yaale, dhuguma godhe.
What happened here today was not a mistake.	Wanti har'a asitti ta'e dogoggora hin turre.
This one is nice.	Inni kun namatti tola.
He said a little and went out again.	Xiqqoo jedhee ammas ba'e.
I couldn’t really tell, not anymore.	Dhuguma beekuu hin dandeenye, kana booda miti.
She’s not that bad.	Isheen hangas hamaa miti.
His wife.	Haadha manaa isaa.
But they were wrong.	Garuu dogoggora turan.
But there is a reason for this.	Garuu kanaaf sababni jira.
It must contain itself.	Of keessaa qabaachuu qaba.
Just the door.	Balbala qofa.
This wasn’t going to work.	Kun hojjechuuf hin turre.
Perhaps he did.	Tarii ni godhe taʼa.
Nothing, you don’t think so.	Wanti hin jiru, akkas sitti hin fakkaatu.
I just can't see why it wouldn't work here.	Maaliif akka asitti hin hojjenne qofa arguu hin danda'u.
It won't be a problem.	Rakkoo hin ta'u.
But what if .	Garuu maal yoo ta'e .
I’m with you on that.	Sana irratti si waliin jira.
That was for a long time.	Sun yeroo dheeraaf ture.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
I was once one of those kids.	Yeroo tokko ijoollee sana keessaa tokko ture.
It wasn’t easy, but he did it.	Salphaa hin turre, garuu ni godhe.
That still wasn’t enough.	Ammallee sun gahaa hin turre.
That went well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti deeme.
I couldn't, I couldn't.	Hin dandeenye hin dandeenye.
Many loved him.	Baay'een isa jaallatu turan.
I started living with her.	Ishee waliin jiraachuu jalqabe.
Everyone wants to be around you.	Namni hundi naannoo kee jiraachuu barbaada.
Like his father.	Akkuma abbaa isaa.
They have hands that aren’t quite hands.	Harka guutummaatti harka hin taane qabu.
But you are a human being.	Ati garuu nama.
I don't know why or when.	Maaliif yoom akka ta'e hin beeku.
You knew it was her.	Ishee ta'uu ishee beekta turte.
That’s just not right.	Sun sirrii miti qofa.
The biggest problem.	Rakkoo guddaa.
Maybe who she was.	Tarii eenyu akka turte ta'a.
I'm just not good enough.	Ani garuu ga'umsa hin qabu qofa.
I didn’t think you were interested.	Fedhii qabda jedhee hin yaadne.
In this she is right.	Kana keessatti isheen sirrii dha.
He was too much for us.	Inni baayʼee nutti baayʼee ture.
If he doesn't speak, he won't tell.	Yoo hin dubbanne hin himu.
I couldn’t believe her.	Ishee amanuu hin dandeenye.
You probably don't want to be.	Ta'uu hin barbaaddu ta'a.
It was better there.	Achitti wayya ture.
He is extremely dangerous.	Inni garmalee balaa qaba.
I don't know what else to tell you.	Ani waan biraa sitti himu hin beeku.
You didn’t have it in you.	Si keessa hin qabdu turte.
I have it with me.	Na waliin qaba.
I should have told you earlier.	Silaa kanaan dura sitti himuu qaba ture.
I know He only wants the best for you.	Inni waan gaarii qofa akka siif barbaadu nan beeka.
It’s all about timing.	Hundi isaa yeroon.
Something completely different.	Waan guutummaatti adda ta'e.
He does whatever we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda ni hojjeta.
I mean, look at these two.	Kana lamaan kana ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
It came out well.	Akka gaariitti ba'e.
I still wasn't sure about it.	Ammallee waa'ee isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
That is not the case here.	Asitti garuu akkas miti.
It was the right one.	Kan sirrii ture.
She wasn't sure.	Isheen mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Only her father could.	Kan danda'u abbaa ishee qofa ture.
Maybe it was that night.	Tarii halkan sana ta'uu danda'a.
You are on my way.	Ati karaa koo irra jirta.
My eyes!	Ija koo!
One possibility, that was.	Carraan tokko, sun ture.
They had none of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin qaban turan.
You don’t have time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu hin qabdu.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
When he wanted to.	Yeroo inni barbaade.
Then there were the people.	Sana booda namoonni turan.
Then he had nothing.	Sana booda homaa hin qabu ture.
That wasn’t an accident.	Sun balaa hin turre.
It does.	Ni godha.
I watched her work for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf hojii ishee ilaale.
You have to give it to him.	Isaaf kennuu qabda.
That wasn’t him.	Sun isa hin turre.
But of course not.	Garuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
They’re just the two of them.	Isaan lamaan qofa.
Everything is there.	Wanti hundi achi jira.
She is not herself.	Isheen ofii ishee miti.
I don't have anything more.	Kana caalaa hin qabu.
We talked about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbanne.
It wasn’t like that before.	Duraan akkas hin turre.
That doesn’t mean just one thing.	Kana jechuun waan tokko qofa miti.
Because tell me the truth.	Sababni isaa dhugaa natti himi.
But only a little bit.	Garuu xiqqoo qofa.
He asked a simple question.	Gaaffii salphaa tokko gaafate.
That is often the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas taʼa.
It was the best one.	Isa gaarii ture.
No one really understood what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru dhuguma namni hubate hin jiru.
I know this is wrong.	Kun dogoggora akka ta'e nan beeka.
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
More than you want!	Kan barbaaddu caalaa!
I'm not at home.	Ani mana hin jiru.
If you don’t want it, you don’t want it.	Yoo hin barbaanne hin barbaanne.
But that wasn’t so bad.	Garuu sun hangas hamaa hin turre.
That’s still my feeling.	Ammallee miira koo kanuma.
I mean, not good at all.	Tasumaa gaarii miti jechuu kooti.
I think everyone enjoyed it.	Namni hundi itti gammade natti fakkaata.
Look at your truth.	Mee dhugaa keessan ilaalaa.
But they’re not easy at all.	Garuu isaan tasumaa salphaa miti.
I hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
No one seems to know the truth.	Namni dhugaa jiru beeku hin fakkaatu.
So sorry about that.	Kanaaf dhiifama waa'ee sanaa.
I mean about her name.	Waa'ee maqaa ishee jechuu kooti.
I can't give my name.	Maqaa koo kennuu hin danda'u.
Not long now.	Yeroo dheeraa miti amma.
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
This is what happened.	Wanti ta'e kana.
She was very tall.	Baayyee dheeraa turte.
More about who he was.	Waa'ee eenyu akka ture caalaatti.
He would never go to her.	Inni gonkumaa gara ishee hin deemu ture.
You have something else.	Waan biraa qabda.
He just needs time.	Yeroo qofa isa barbaachisa.
Of course, she will do her best.	Waan dandeessu hunda akka gootu beekamaadha.
This was my chance.	Kun carraa koo ture.
But this morning.	Garuu ganama kana.
I really saw her.	Dhuguma ishee arge.
Nothing seemed very important now.	Amma wanti baay'ee barbaachisaa ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
It doesn’t seem that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura hin fakkaatu.
I thought it was worse than that.	Kana caalaa natti hamaa natti fakkaate.
No one else could do it, he thought.	Namni biraa gochuu hin danda'u jedhee yaade.
I can go where you won't go.	Bakka ati hin deemne deemuu nan danda'a.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
Not really sure.	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa miti.
No daughter, of course.	Intala hin qabu, beekamaadha.
Maybe not this year though.	Tarii bara kana garuu hin ta'u.
It seemed a little too simple.	Xiqqoo garmalee salphaa fakkaata ture.
I will be his wife.	Ani haadha manaa isaa ta'a.
Don’t you have anything else to do?	Waan biraa hojjechuu qabdu hin qabduu?
And not ever again.	Ammas yoomiyyuu miti.
You’re not going there.	Ati achi hin deemtu.
This one was not necessary.	Tokko kun barbaachisaa hin turre.
He didn't make a promise.	Waadaa hin galle.
Not that week.	Torban sana miti.
She has no one.	Nama hin qabdu.
But we have to do the work.	Garuu hojii sana hojjechuu qabna.
That was most important.	Sun hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ture.
But look at what he says.	Garuu waan inni jedhu mee ilaalaa.
You have to do what you have to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu gochuu qabda.
Maybe he's the person you're looking for.	Tarii nama ati barbaaddu ta'uu danda'a.
So he did it.	Kanaaf godhe.
I don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabu.
I can't tell you what's going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru sitti himuu hin danda'u.
Look at this picture.	Suuraa kana ilaalaa.
Otherwise, not so much.	Yoo kana hin taane hangas miti.
You don’t have to do everything.	Waan hundumaa gochuun dirqama miti.
Everything is extremely good.	Wanti hundi garmalee gaarii dha.
Look at it there.	Achi ilaalaa.
It’s big, but definitely not the biggest in the area.	Guddaa dha, garuu naannoo sanatti isa guddaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
She really had no idea what she wanted.	Dhuguma waan barbaaddu yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
I can't have her there today.	Har'a achitti ishee qabaachuu hin danda'u.
This, however, is not a major problem.	Kun garuu rakkoo guddaa miti.
Now he wasn’t just a man.	Amma nama qofa hin turre.
Full name required.	Maqaa guutuu barbaachisa.
They know there is more to it.	Kana caalaa akka jiru ni beeku.
He lives here.	Inni as jiraata.
My whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu.
That should be enough.	Sun gahaa ta'uu qaba.
Everyone wants some money!	Namni hundi qarshii tokko tokko barbaada!
I was just a guy.	Ani gurbaa qofa ture.
He is a human being.	Nama dha.
Not sure how this is supposed to work.	Kun akkamitti hojjechuu akka qabu mirkanaa'aa miti.
Look at the light.	Ifa ilaalaa.
None of it was needed.	Tokkollee hin barbaachifne.
He would have said.	Silaa jedha.
We are here to help you.	Si gargaaruuf as jirra.
Good job.	Hojii gaarii.
We are not evil.	Nuti hamaa miti.
He wasn't there.	Achi hin turre.
I really don’t think anyone does that.	Dhuguma namni akkas godhu natti hin fakkaatu.
From everyone, all of you.	Nama hunda irraa, hunda keessan irraa.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
But that was never for him.	Garuu sun gonkumaa isaaf hin turre.
You are not alone in this.	Kana keessatti ati kophaa kee miti.
I don’t have the money.	Ani qarshii hin qabu.
Not many, but a few.	Baay'ee miti, muraasa malee.
I know that he knows.	Inni akka beeku nan beeka.
He knows he doesn’t have that.	Sana akka hin qabne ni beeka.
I will do that.	Ani akkas nan godha.
Very, very long.	Baayyee baayyee dheeraa.
We are all	Hundi keenya .
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin hojjenne.
We didn’t do it.	Nuti hin goone.
But there’s more to it than that.	Garuu kana caalaa jira.
It shouldn't have been.	Ta'uu hin qabu ture.
It contains the present.	Yeroo ammaa of keessaa qaba.
He knows nothing about me.	Waa'ee koo homaa hin beeku.
He looked inside.	Keessa ilaale.
But you are very good.	Garuu ati baayyee gaarii dha.
So it's going to be very important there.	Kanaaf achitti baayyee barbaachisaa ta'uuf deema.
Isn't it bad? 	Hamaa mitii?
No one is like them.	Namni isaan fakkaatu hin jiru.
Tell us a bit about yourself.	Waa'ee kee xiqqoo nuuf himi.
I'm going to be.	Ani nan ta'a.
More than each other.	Wal caalaa.
You can make some serious money.	Maallaqa guddaa tokko tokko argachuu dandeessa.
This is just my opinion though.	Kun garuu yaada koo qofa.
It doesn’t mean without work.	Hojii malee jechuu miti.
There’s something they won’t tell you.	Wanti isaan sitti hin himne tokko jira.
Not mine, not ever.	Kan koo miti, yoomiyyuu miti.
Everything you want.	Waan barbaaddu hunda.
He didn’t tell anyone where he was going.	Eessa akka deemu namatti hin himne.
But that’s still not what you want.	Garuu ammallee wanti ati barbaaddu sun miti.
Certainly not one of us.	Nu keessaa tokko akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But even that’s not so bad.	Garuu sun illee akkas hamaa miti.
There again he had all the roads available.	Achitti ammas karaa jiru hunda qaba ture.
They have a lot.	Baay'ee qabu.
If it does, it will happen.	Yoo ta'e ni ta'a.
I don't know what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
Just see what happens today.	Har'a maal akka ta'u qofa ilaalaa.
I don’t know when that time will come.	Yeroon sun yoom akka dhufu hin beeku.
It was too real.	Garmalee dhugaa ture.
It was so good tonight.	Halkan kana akka malee gaarii ture.
That could be a huge mistake.	Sun dogoggora guddaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
He says.	Jedha.
It wasn’t like her.	Akka ishee hin turre.
He may even be good.	Inni gaarii illee taʼuu dandaʼa.
That was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture.
No one knew exactly what to do.	Namni maal akka godhu sirriitti beeku hin turre.
I was never that person again.	Amma booda nama sana ta'ee hin beeku.
I said look at it.	Anis ilaalaa jedheen.
A lot of people were there for me.	Namoonni baay'een naaf turan.
You have to do this.	Kana gochuu qabda.
Like a few of them.	Akkuma isaan keessaa muraasa.
I know that light.	Ifa sana nan beeka.
The possibility seems real.	Ta'uu danda'u dhugaa fakkaata.
I love her, I love her.	Ishee nan jaalladha.
I'm sure of that.	Sana mirkanaa'aa dha.
She stayed with me for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa na waliin turte.
I had no idea where he was.	Eessa akka jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It used to be completely like that.	Duraan guutummaatti akkas ture.
But he was in trouble.	Garuu rakkoo keessa ture.
He certainly isn’t good.	Inni gaarii akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He says he doesn’t, but he does.	Hin qabu jedha, garuu ni qaba.
I looked at him.	jedheen ilaale.
Then he looked at his watch.	Sana booda sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
He had to be in school.	Mana barumsaa keessa jiraachuu qaba ture.
I want some alone time with you.	Yeroo muraasa kophaa koo si waliin barbaada.
I didn’t want to live anywhere else.	Bakka biraa jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
Something more like.	Waan caalaa akka.
She wasn’t drinking.	Isheen dhugaatii hin turre.
That was a bad idea.	Sun yaada hamaa ture.
He was right there.	Inni sirriitti achi ture.
In three weeks.	Torban sadii keessatti.
We still have hope.	Ammas abdii qabna.
He didn’t have it though.	Hin qabu ture malee.
It was still new.	Ammas haaraa ture.
He had to see her.	Ishee arguu qaba ture.
But he is one.	Garuu inni tokko.
I didn't see why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin argine.
But it’s not just a bar.	Garuu mana dhugaatii qofa miti.
You have a good reputation.	Maqaa gaarii qabda.
I’m not that great.	Ani hangas guddaa miti.
Again, pretty simple stuff.	Ammas, waan baay'ee salphaa ta'e.
She is still not there.	Ammallee hin jirtu.
It really doesn’t matter anymore.	Dhuguma kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
A handful, maybe more.	Harka muraasa, tarii kana caalaa.
But, perhaps, not for you.	Garuu, tarii, siif miti.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
Where are we going today?	Har'a eessa deemaa jirra?
They want you here.	Asitti si barbaadu.
But that is not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas miti.
Please do it for us more often.	Mee yeroo baay'ee nuuf gochuu qabdu.
You don’t have to make mistakes.	Dogoggora hojjechuu hin qabdu.
But he found it too much.	Garuu garmalee ta'uu argate.
I couldn’t even get that right.	Sana sirriitti illee argachuu hin dandeenye.
I’m happy for him, really.	Isaaf gammadeera, dhuguma.
It’s new here.	Asitti haaraa dha.
So we are together again.	Kanaaf ammas waliin jirra.
He didn’t want any of it.	Inni tokkollee hin barbaanne.
I can't do this tonight.	Halkan kana gochuu hin danda'u.
It would be a great thing.	Waan guddaa ta'a.
I mean, probably.	Ta'uu hin oolu jechuu kooti.
Maybe there wasn’t one.	Tarii tokkollee hin turre.
I don't know this.	Ani kana hin beeku.
I mean, he doesn't.	Hin godhu jechuu kooti.
This is very dangerous.	Kun balaa guddaa qaba.
You can, you know.	Ni dandeessa, beekta.
No work, no food.	Hojii hin qabu, nyaata hin qabu.
I wonder how they are doing that.	Akkamitti akkas gochaa jiru jedheen yaada.
But he was always there.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa achi ture.
He realized it wasn't necessary, it could even be dangerous.	Barbaachisaa akka hin taane, balaa illee ta'uu akka danda'u hubate.
I don't like talking about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin jaalladhu.
Just like my father.	Akkuma abbaa kooti.
There is no one there.	Namni achi hin jiru.
He still doesn't think it matters.	Ammas dhimma itti hin fakkaatu.
About both things.	Waa'ee waan lamaan.
You don’t want that.	Ati akkas hin barbaaddu.
It’s just not true.	Dhugaa miti qofa.
They were real.	Isaan dhugaa turan.
They have two weeks.	Torban lama qabu.
He was really on his own now.	Dhuguma amma ofuma isaatiin ture.
Hope was bright.	Abdiin ifa ture.
I have.	Ani qaba.
It doesn’t seem real, none.	Dhugaa hin fakkaatu, tokkollee hin fakkaatu.
Dad in the wrong.	Abbaa dogoggora keessa.
I don't need anything.	Homaa na hin barbaachisu.
That doesn’t exist anymore.	Sun kana booda hin jiru.
That's what happens.	Kan ta'u kanuma.
I love my room so much.	Kutaa koo baay'een jaalladha.
I don't know much about any of those.	Waa'ee warra sana keessaa tokkollee waan baay'ee hin beeku.
Something would be wrong.	Silaa wanti tokko dogoggora ta'a.
He doesn’t want to believe it.	Inni amanuu hin barbaadu.
It's been bad.	Hamaa ta'e.
That’s not all.	Kanuma miti.
But you don’t want to do this.	Garuu kana gochuu hin barbaaddu.
But I can say this.	Garuu kana jechuu nan danda'a.
Just what that meant, I wasn't sure.	Sun maal jechuu akka ta'e qofa, mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
She was too sure.	Garmalee mirkanaa'aa turte.
This stuff really works.	Wanti kun dhuguma ni hojjeta.
It doesn’t seem to have been.	Waan ture hin fakkaatu.
Looks like they were just here.	As qofa waan turan fakkaata.
He did this.	Kana godhe.
Usually against us.	Yeroo baayyee nu irratti.
I don’t think that’s true.	Sun dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu.
I don't want to be a motherly person.	Ani nama haadha ta'uu hin barbaadu.
He matters.	Inni dhimma qaba.
I want you here with me.	As na waliin akka jirtu nan barbaada.
We had no home, no place.	Mana hin qabnu, bakka hin qabnu turre.
No one is going to help you.	Namni si gargaaruuf deemu hin jiru.
This is not what we need.	Kun waan nu barbaachisu miti.
Except for me, of course.	Ana malee, beekamaadha.
It was all very positive.	Hundi isaa waan baayyee gaarii ture.
But then there was the question of this picture.	Garuu sana booda gaaffii suuraa kanaa ture.
I don't know what it was.	Maal akka ture hin beeku.
I have no idea whatsoever.	Ani yaada tokkollee hin qabu.
That’s really all there is to it.	Dhuguma kana qofa.
You may never find one.	Tarii gonkumaa tokkollee argachuu hin dandeessu.
She said we had to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna jette.
Then there’s everything.	Sana booda hunda jira.
Everything is happening quickly.	Wanti hundi dafee ta'aa jira.
Not after the fact.	Dhugaa jiru booda miti.
They are working on it now.	Amma irratti hojjechaa jiru.
Seems easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata.
It seemed like a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa fakkaata ture.
Anything can happen then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti hundi taʼuu dandaʼa.
It requires an hour.	Sa'aatii barbaada.
I didn’t see it that way.	Akkasitti hin argine.
He had two hands.	Harka lama qaba ture.
Not so much anymore.	Kana booda hangas miti.
I love this house so much.	Mana kana baay'een jaalladha.
Make fun of yourself.	Ofitti qoosaa.
I love her so much.	Baay'een ishee jaalladha.
He didn’t make it work.	Akka hojjetu hin goone.
You made me good money.	Maallaqa gaarii naaf goote.
She really got me going.	Dhuguma akkan deemu na goote.
Once upon a time.	Yeroo tokko.
You are doing well.	Ati akka gaariitti hojjechaa jirta.
Money.	Maallaqa.
So of course, it has to do.	Kanaaf beekamaadha, gochuu qaba.
Someone was watching him.	Namni tokko isa ilaalaa ture.
I need it.	Na barbaachisa.
That wasn’t something we thought about.	Sun waan itti yaadne hin turre.
It was much, much more.	Baayyee baayyee caalaa ture.
They look pretty great.	Isaan baayyee guddaa fakkaatu.
Then there is the problem of children.	Sana booda rakkoon ijoollee jira.
My good friends.	Hiriyyoota koo gaarii.
He thinks today is the right time.	Har'a yeroo sirrii itti fakkaata.
This is not the case here.	Asitti kun hin ta'u.
We need to have more.	Kana caalaa qabaachuu qabna.
He told himself this was his job.	Kun hojii isaa akka ta'e ofitti hime.
It's possible, but dangerous.	Ni danda'ama, garuu balaa qaba.
But mostly on my own.	Garuu irra caalaa ofuma koo irratti.
But it hasn’t happened yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti hin taane.
Yet another problem.	Ammas rakkoo biraa.
Today is not that day.	Har'a guyyaa sana miti.
I don't understand this.	Kana naaf hin galle.
I don’t know if that tells us anything.	Sun waan tokko nutti himuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
But this year would be different.	Garuu bara kana adda ta'a ture.
Unless you are a human being.	Yoo nama taate malee.
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa.
This is not a retreat.	Kun duubatti deebi'uu miti.
He gave everything.	Waan hundumaa kenne.
Now you have nothing.	Amma homaa hin qabdu.
Maybe it's a good idea.	Tarii yaada gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
Everything she was.	Waan isheen turte hunda.
I didn’t know her that well.	Ani akkasitti ishee hin beeku ture.
Everyone can tell if it's not yours.	Yoo kee hin taane namni hundi himuu ni danda'a.
Soon something will be on its way for you.	Yeroo dhiyootti wanti tokko karaa siif ta'a.
It was a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee ture.
And yet, here it was.	Ammas ta’ee, asitti ture.
Question?	Gaaffii?
But none of that ever stayed with us.	Garuu sun tokkollee gonkumaa nutti hin turre.
But it must be said.	Garuu jechuun dirqama.
But they’re totally different.	Garuu isaan guutummaatti adda.
We need to do this.	Kana gochuu qabna.
But it’s not easy.	Garuu waan salphaa miti.
I am always with you.	Yeroo hundumaa isin waliin jira.
And that’s not all.	Kana qofa miti.
Drink overnight.	Halkan tokko dhugaa.
It was all going on.	Hundi isaa deemaa ture.
He had a book.	Kitaaba qaba ture.
I didn’t need them anymore.	Kana booda isaan hin barbaachisu ture.
He did not promise to do so.	Akkas gochuuf waadaa hin galle.
But that, of course, is not true.	Garuu sun, dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Three hours ago.	Sa'aatii sadii dura.
There is nothing you can do about this.	Kana irratti wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
Something that is important to do.	Waan gochuun barbaachisaa taʼe tokko.
Maybe something not so good.	Tarii waan akkas gaarii hin taane.
I was trying to.	Ani yaalaa ture.
Tell him it's me.	Ana ta'uu isaa itti himi.
Someone found a picture of that.	Namni tokko suuraa sanaa argate.
But no one understood.	Garuu namni hubate hin jiru.
I know it was mine.	Kan koo akka ture nan beeka.
But that’s not so true.	Garuu sun akkasitti dhugaa miti.
We need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna.
We can’t do it without them.	Isaan malee gochuu hin dandeenyu.
I can believe this.	Kana amanuu nan danda'a.
But he could not do this.	Garuu kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
I know my man.	Nama koo nan beeka.
He does his job.	Hojii isaa hojjeta.
She just doesn’t know anything.	Isheen waan tokkollee hin beektu qofa.
He wasn’t there for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi hin turre.
He certainly knew the answer.	Deebii isaa akka beeku beekamaadha.
You can’t do everything.	Waan hundumaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
But, most importantly, he didn’t have his father.	Garuu, hunda caalaa abbaa isaa hin qabu ture.
Just kidding, just kidding.	Qoosaa qofa, qoosaa qofa.
Unique.	Adda.
I just have mine.	Kan koo qofa qaba.
It was exactly the same feeling.	Sirriitti miira wal fakkaatu ture.
It works a lot.	Baayyee hojjeta.
Someone has to be a non-human.	Namni tokko nama hin taane ta'uu qaba.
They mean.	Jechuun isaanii.
It may not be new.	Haaraa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
No one answered.	Namni deebii kenne hin jiru.
Good luck with your daughter.	Intala keessan waliin carraa gaarii.
I am trying to do the same thing.	Anis kanuma hojjechuuf yaalaa jira.
Maybe it never will.	Tarii gonkumaa hin ta'u ta'a.
He couldn't play.	Taphachuu hin dandeenye.
Something just happened, he wants to tell me.	Waan tokko amma ta'e, natti himuu barbaada.
I looked at him.	Anis isa ilaale.
So he would go.	Kanaaf ni deema ture.
I wanted to do a little bit.	Xiqqoo hojjechuu barbaade.
Who lives here?	Eenyutu as jiraata?
I don’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabu.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
I know better than you.	Si caalaa nan beeka.
He is not there.	Inni achi hin jiru.
We can’t know.	Beekuu hin dandeenyu.
No one came.	Namni dhufe hin jiru.
That if he did that.	Osoo akkas godhe sun akka ta'u.
We thought about that.	Sana irratti yaadne.
I didn't know that.	Ani kana hin beeku ture.
What do people think of you?	Namoonni maal siif yaadu?
But not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf garuu miti.
He was never late.	Inni gonkumaa booda hin turre.
You know a little bit about it.	Waa'ee isaa xiqqoo xiqqoo ni beekta.
Which was obvious.	Kan ifa ture.
It was just bad.	Hamaa qofa ture.
I just don't understand what it is.	Maal akka ta'e qofa naaf hin galle.
Again, that’s me.	Ammas, sun ana.
He's probably too lucky to scream.	Inni carraa guddaa iyyuu ta'uu hin oolu.
He was a teacher at my school.	Mana barumsaa kootti barsiisaa ture.
You are here to help her.	Ishee gargaaruuf as jirta.
I know she does.	Akka isheen gootu nan beeka.
Which she probably couldn’t do with me.	Kan isheen tarii na waliin gochuu hin dandeenye.
There was no one there.	Namni achi jiru hin turre.
So they didn’t have time.	Kanaaf yeroo hin qaban turan.
I am watching this time.	Yeroo kana yeroon ilaalaa jira.
There’s nothing you can’t have.	Wanti ati qabaachuu hin dandeenye hin jiru.
One person	Namni tokko .
So you don’t like them.	Kanaaf isaan hin jaallattu.
He's pretty good about it.	Inni waa'ee kanaa baay'ee gaarii dha.
I like a lot of things.	Waan baay'een natti tola.
He wanted to be.	Ta'uu barbaade.
He can do anything.	Waan hundumaa hojjechuu danda'a.
I know you don’t mean that.	Akkas jechuu kee akka hin taane nan beeka.
To give, to give, to give.	Kennuu, kennuu, kennuu.
You have to know.	Beekuu qabda.
They had no jobs.	Hojii hin qaban turan.
You were so different from her.	Ati ishee irraa baayyee adda turte.
It was going in your eyes.	Ija kee keessa deemaa ture.
But it's not to be.	Garuu ta'uuf miti.
Look at the picture.	Mee suuraa ilaalaa.
I'm sure she'll love it.	Akka isheen jaallattu mirkanaa'adha.
It wasn’t his thing.	Waan isaa hin turre.
A week ago.	Torban tokko dura.
I shouldn’t have said anything like that.	Silaa waan akkasii dubbachuu hin qabu ture.
He may not eat.	Nyaachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
The timing was not lucky.	Yeroon sun carraa hin turre.
It wasn’t necessary.	Hin barbaachifne.
Look at what he did.	Mee waan inni hojjete ilaalaa.
Not now, not yet.	Amma miti, ammallee miti.
I really need help with this.	Dhuguma kanaan gargaarsa barbaada.
Maybe a little bit.	Tarii xiqqoo.
She was his mother.	Isheen haadha isaa turte.
I don’t have a daughter.	Intala hin qabu.
He might not have said anything.	Silaa homaa hin dubbanne ta'a.
She had to see it for herself.	Ofii ishee arguu qabdi turte.
Most of the time, you don't have that.	Yeroo baayyee, sana hin qabdu.
This was real life.	Kun jireenya dhugaa ture.
Very obvious, and untrue.	Baayyee ifa, fi dhugaa hin qabne.
But they are by no means alone.	Isaan garuu tasumaa kophaa isaanii miti.
I don’t know why he did this, but it looked really good.	Maaliif akka kana godhe hin beeku, garuu dhuguma gaarii fakkaata ture.
But that can't be the only thing.	Garuu sun qofa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I can get everything.	Waan hundumaa argachuu nan danda'a.
I haven’t done that yet.	Ani hanga ammaatti akkas hin goone.
It’s on the road.	Karaa irra jira.
I didn’t understand.	Hin hubanne.
None of that matters.	Sana keessaa tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
Everyone wants money.	Namni hundi maallaqa barbaada.
From your place.	Bakka keessan irraa.
Thus, it is still unclear.	Haala kanaan ammallee ifa miti.
Please tell me if you can find a dog.	Mee saree argachuu dandeessa natti himi.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
You can see their eyes better.	Ija isaanii caalaatti arguu dandeessa.
This was what she wanted.	Kun waan isheen barbaaddu ture.
They are the lucky few.	Isaan warra carraa qaban muraasa.
I'm in school.	Ani mana barumsaa jira.
You're alone.	Kophaa kee jirta.
Soon, it would be.	Yeroo dhiyootti, ni ta'a ture.
She just didn’t want one anymore.	Kana booda tokko qofa hin barbaaddu turte.
I didn't understand her.	Ishee hin hubanne.
I hadn’t thought of that.	Ani sana hin yaadne ture.
We have to work a lot.	Baay'ee hojjechuu qabna.
I don’t know where it goes from there though.	Achi irraa eessa akka deemu hin beeku garuu.
Clearly, that is not the case here.	Asitti akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
He certainly loves it.	Inni akka jaallatu beekamaadha.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
She had to be alone.	Kophaa taʼuu qabdi turte.
This year, however, things are different.	Bara kana garuu wanti jiru adda.
That they don’t work.	Akka isaan hin hojjenne.
I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
That should help you.	Sun si gargaaruu qaba.
It was really happening.	Dhuguma ta'aa ture.
He loves you very, very much.	Inni baay'ee baay'ee si jaallata.
It might just be a day in the life.	Jireenya keessatti guyyaa tokko qofa ta’uu danda’a.
I don't think he had much.	Waan baay'ee qaba ture natti hin fakkaatu.
Things could’ve gone the other way.	Silaa wanti karaa biraa deemuu danda’a ture.
But this is it.	Garuu kana.
You could probably do better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa taʼuu hin oolu.
What did he mean? 	Maal jechuu ture?
It’s not always a good thing.	Yeroo hunda waan gaarii miti.
It seems to have worked.	Hojjete fakkaata.
This has been happening today.	Kun har'a ta'aa tureera.
I think that’s great.	Sun waan guddaa natti fakkaata.
I don't want you can have.	Ani hin barbaadu qabaachuu dandeessa.
One opportunity.	Carraa tokko.
You should have been here hours ago.	Silaa sa'aatii dura as jiraachuu qabda turte.
It was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture.
Which is very big and dangerous.	Kan baayyee guddaa fi balaa qabu.
That’s just my opinion.	Sun yaada koo qofa.
So this is something new.	Kanaaf kun waan haaraa dha.
A lot of people do that.	Namoonni baay'een akkas godhu.
I have to go now.	Amma deemuun qaba.
All very good.	Hundi baayyee gaarii dha.
So it can't be much.	Kanaaf baay'ee ta'uu hin danda'u.
He just couldn't meet his father's eyes.	Ija abbaa isaa waliin wal arguu qofa hin dandeenye.
There is still time to go.	Ammas yeroon itti deemtu jira.
But it's probably not.	Garuu ta'uu hin oolu.
Today, it's just you.	Har'a, si qofa.
But there's one thing that could be important.	Garuu wanti barbaachisaa ta'uu danda'u tokko jira.
I don’t really have that much money.	Dhuguma maallaqa hamma kanaa hin qabu.
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
It didn’t even have a name.	Maqaa illee hin qabu ture.
I want to do my best.	Waan danda'u hunda gochuu nan barbaada.
We had no idea who he was.	Eenyu akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabnu turre.
She was in a good mood today.	Har'a miira gaarii keessa turte.
Bae is my friend.	Bae kooti.
His voice again.	Sagalee isaa ammas.
I haven’t seen it before.	Kana dura hin argine.
I had no idea where she was.	Eessa akka jirtu yaada hin qabu ture.
So far I have one.	Hanga ammaatti tokko qaba.
Not everyone was so lucky.	Namni hundi akkas carraa hin qabu ture.
The perfect one.	Kan guutuu ta'e.
It was so fresh.	Akka malee haaraa ture.
You knew it was coming.	Akka dhufu beekta turte.
I just didn't think this would work.	Kun ni hojjeta jedhee hin yaadne qofa.
It is often ahead of us.	Yeroo baayyee nu dura jira.
I don't know much about it.	Waa'ee isaa baay'ee hin beeku.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
That didn’t happen.	Sun hin taane.
It's very long.	Baayyee dheeraa dha.
He obviously didn’t know what to do.	Waan godhu akka hin beekne ifaadha.
I can absolutely tell you, it doesn't.	Ani guutummaatti sitti himuu nan danda'a, hin ta'u.
That was all it was.	Kana qofa ture.
There is no time like the present.	Yeroon akka ammaa hin jiru.
It looked like clockwork.	Sa'aatii fakkaata ture.
But I will do it.	Ani garuu nan godha.
They had no children of their own.	Ijoollee ofii hin qaban turan.
Age does that.	Umuriin akkas ni godha.
Wrong, just a little bit.	Dogoggora, xiqqoo qofa.
More so with children.	Ijoollee wajjin caalaatti.
It can be something very different.	Waan baay’ee adda ta’e ta’uu danda’a.
He took to it very quickly.	Baayyee dafee itti fudhate.
I arrived late, too.	Anis yeroon booda dhufe.
This isn't about them.	Kun waa'ee isaanii miti.
Nothing special about them.	Isaan keessaa wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
I don’t have a car.	Konkolaataa hin qabu.
Many of them.	Baay'ee isaanii.
Then he saw what to do.	Sana booda maal akka godhu arge.
I wanted to do it.	Anis gochuu barbaade.
It was very clear.	Baayyee ifa ture.
You are not my father.	Ati abbaa koo miti.
It's more like a watch.	Caalaatti sa'aatii fakkaata.
He was completely alone.	Inni guutummaatti kophaa isaa ture.
That wasn’t good enough.	Sun gaarii hin turre.
It’s not even a joke.	Qoosaa illee miti.
They may even be better.	Isaan caalaa illee taʼuu dandaʼu.
No one answered.	Namni deebii kenne hin jiru.
Sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko.
It was still theirs.	Ammas kan isaanii ture.
Things were good then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti gaarii ture.
It requires emotion.	Miira barbaada.
Hope that helps!.	Abdii sun akka gargaaru!.
It was right on us.	Sirriitti nu irra ture.
he says.	jedha.
Not one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee miti.
No one met his eyes.	Namni ija isaa waliin wal arge hin jiru.
This isn't about you.	Kun waa'ee kee miti.
It worked.	Hojjete.
There was nothing in it.	Wanti keessa hin turre.
I say a lot, but not a lot.	Baay'een jedha malee baay'ee miti.
Not very long.	Baayyee dheeraa miti.
I didn’t think anything of it then.	Yeroo sana homaa itti hin yaadne.
That says a lot about you, about them.	Sun waa'ee kee, waa'ee isaanii waan baay'ee dubbata.
It is clear on that.	Sana irratti ifaadha.
But I want to find another way.	Garuu karaa biraa argachuu barbaada.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay’ee.
She absolutely had to be.	Isheen guutummaatti ta'uu qabdi turte.
Not really enough.	Dhuguma gahaa miti.
It was a thing of the past.	Waan darbe ture.
You can't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeessu.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I think it will work.	Ni hojjeta jedheen yaada.
It works very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
While being first rarely means being the best.	Dura ta’uu jechuun yeroo muraasaaf hunda caalaa ta’uu jechuu yoo ta’u.
They are all obvious here.	Hundi isaanii asitti ifaadha.
He said it was very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola jedhe.
Look at what we’ve done here.	Mee waan asitti hojjenne ilaalaa.
Be a good mother and a good father.	Haadha gaarii fi abbaa gaarii ta'aa.
Another in the background.	Kan biraa duubatti.
There is no problem here.	Asitti rakkoon hin jiru.
We just have to see it.	Arguu qofa qabna.
His most important moment.	Yeroo isaa isa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
Good luck!.	Carraa gaarii!.
Now this is important.	Amma kun barbaachisaa dha.
He took every opportunity.	Carraa hunda fudhate.
You're the only one.	Ati qofa.
How many years? 	Waggaa meeqa?
It was before everything else.	Waan hundumaa dura ture.
It is very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
He is waiting outside your house.	Mana keessan ala eegaa jira.
There was no longer any other sound in the room.	Kutaa sana keessa kana booda sagalee biraa hin turre.
It may not be current but it works well.	Yeroo ammaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a garuu akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Only now you know me better.	Amma qofa caalaatti na beekta.
No one wants anything.	Namni homaa barbaadu hin jiru.
He has parents.	Warra qaba.
I mean, I would never be a teacher.	Silaa gonkumaa barsiisaa hin ta'u jechuu kooti.
How do you	Akkamitti .
Three things happened today.	Har'a waan sadii ta'e.
I love it so much.	Ani baay'een jaalladha.
Nobody wants to be that guy.	Namni gurbaa sana ta'uu hin barbaadu.
No one else was around.	Namni biraa naannoo sana hin turre.
This seemed more homely.	Kun caalaatti kan manaa fakkaata ture.
You have to play together.	Waliin taphachuu qabda.
He has to go now.	Amma deemuu qaba.
No one will ever know the truth.	Namni dhugaa jiru gonkumaa beeku hin jiru.
I didn't know about that.	Waa'ee sanaa hin beeku ture.
But only rarely.	Garuu yeroo muraasa qofa.
I think he was into it.	Inni keessa ture natti fakkaata.
Only not one bit.	Qofa xiqqoo tokkollee miti.
I never knew it.	Ani gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
I don't say anything.	Maal hin jedhu.
He says exactly what he has to say.	Waan dubbachuu qabu sirriitti dubbata.
Not to make a big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa akka hin taane.
Yours is different.	Kan kee garuu adda.
Today was great.	Har'a guddaa ture.
I can never come back from this.	Kana keessaa gonkumaa deebi'uu hin danda'u.
Usually that is obvious.	Yeroo baayyee sun ifaadha.
It's just that it's home.	Mana ta'uu isaa qofa.
It really came into my own.	Dhuguma kan kootti dhufe.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
That’s more dangerous.	Sun caalaatti balaa qaba.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin barbaanne.
I just don't know if that's wrong or not.	Sun dogoggora ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa qofa hin beeku.
He's looking at you.	Si ilaalaa jira.
She had to come back today.	Har'a deebi'uu qabdi turte.
There wasn’t one.	Tokkollee hin turre.
No one else could do that.	Namni biraa akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
It works really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
It can be a bad life.	Jireenya hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
It is such a disaster!	Balaa akkasii dha!
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
I wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice.	Ani dogoggora wal fakkaatu yeroo lama hojjechuuf hin turre.
Perhaps she was at work.	Tarii hojii irra turte taʼa.
I didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
But this is not right.	Garuu kun sirrii miti.
It can't be true, it can't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u, dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
A lot of things happen.	Waan baay'een ta'a.
He looked at me a lot.	Baay'ee na ilaale.
If it is necessary.	Yoo dirqama ta'e.
This is obviously incorrect.	Kun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
But as you said, you don’t want this.	Garuu akkuma ati jette kana hin barbaaddu.
You can’t live without me.	Ana malee jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
She doesn’t love us.	Isheen nu hin jaallattu.
I don’t know how she did it.	Akkamitti akka goote hin beeku.
We must live	Jiraachuu qabna .
Please, please, please.	Maaloo, maaloo, maaloo.
People need to know they matter.	Namoonni dhimma akka qaban beekuu qabu.
This is the right time.	Yeroon kun yeroo sirrii dha.
We need to stay up here for a bit.	Xiqqoo as ol turuu qabna.
You can’t help me.	Na gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
I told a lot about myself.	Waa'ee ofii koo baay'een hime.
We have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabna.
But very few of them.	Garuu isaan keessaa baayyee muraasa.
But it wasn't supposed to be.	Garuu ta'uu hin qabu ture.
He bought his watch new.	Sa'aatii isaa haaraa bite.
It sounds like he wants to say more.	Kana caalaa dubbachuu akka barbaadu fakkaata.
One must always tell the truth.	Namni tokko yeroo hundumaa dhugaa dubbachuu qaba.
But that only became clear much later.	Garuu sun yeroo baayʼee booda qofa ifa taʼe.
I didn’t want to miss anything.	Waan tokkollee akkan hin qabne hin barbaanne.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
I will do this.	Ani kana nan godha.
But that didn’t make him wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora isa hin goone.
Which wasn’t.	Kan hin turre.
He must be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu qaba.
You have a chance to do some good.	Gaarii tokko tokko hojjechuuf carraa qabda.
Which is pretty good.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
Someone had to say it.	Namni tokko jechuu qaba ture.
I mean, not really.	Dhuguma miti jechuu kooti.
What is it that is.	Maaltu dha.
You don’t want me there.	Achitti na hin barbaaddu.
I did not know why or how.	Maaliif akkamitti akka taʼe hin beeku ture.
He knows the time is right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii ta'uu isaa ni beeka.
But she didn't know that.	Isheen garuu kana hin beektu turte.
I know him, I do nothing without him.	Ani isa beeka, isa malee homaa hin godhu.
And then again.	Sana booda ammas.
That wasn’t easy.	Sun waan salphaa hin turre.
Who says that?	Eenyutu akkas jedha?
No one can help you.	Namni si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Maybe it still exists.	Tarii ammallee jira.
That’s just my life.	Sun jireenya koo qofa.
You don't even know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e illee hin beektu.
I still don’t know what to do.	Ammallee maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
You better go without us.	Nu malee deemuun siif wayya.
What do they know?.	Maal beeku?.
Something else could happen.	Wanti biraa taʼuu dandaʼa.
She has you thinking about it.	Isheen akka itti yaaddu si qabdi.
Very, very long times.	Yeroo baayyee baayyee dheeraa.
I want to do something different.	Waan adda ta'e hojjechuu barbaada.
I don’t want her right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana ishee hin barbaadu.
But she’s not one of those, she’s not.	Garuu isheen akkasii keessaa tokko miti, isheen miti.
You have the right idea.	Yaada sirrii qabda.
I thought it was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii natti fakkaate.
This may be true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
It doesn’t look like that anymore.	Kana booda akkas hin fakkaatu.
So far, that is.	Hanga ammaatti jechuun.
But soon enough.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti.
But there is no one else.	Garuu namni biraa hin jiru.
Mostly from life.	Irra caalaa jireenya irraa.
None of your business.	Dhimma keessan tokkollee hin jiru.
Look at this picture.	Suuraa kana ilaalaa.
He is doing a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjechaa jira.
No one should have said it.	Namni jechuu hin qabu ture.
Meant.	Jechuu barbaade.
I want them to be.	Ani isaan barbaada.
Neither of them looked their best.	Lamaan isaanii iyyuu waan isaanii isa gaarii fakkaatu hin turre.
But it was important to make him a great guy.	Garuu gurbaa guddaa akka ta'u gochuun barbaachisaa ture.
I need an answer.	Deebii na barbaachisa.
We did very well with them.	Isaan waliin baayyee gaarii hojjenne.
He should have seen him when he came home.	Silaa yeroo mana dhufu isa arguu qaba ture.
But we wanted to be parents.	Garuu warra ta'uu barbaanne.
But, but, but.	Garuu, garuu, garuu.
I didn’t have any of it.	Ani tokkollee hin qabu ture.
We are not saying that.	Akkas jechuu keenya miti.
I don’t know if anyone else exists.	Namni biraa jiraachuu isaa hin beeku.
There was no one at home.	Namni manaa hin turre.
He, he knew who he was.	Inni, eenyu akka ta'e beeka ture.
I have a lot of facts.	Ani baay'ee dhugaa qaba.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Garuu isa qofa hin turre.
Maybe it really is.	Tarii dhuguma ta'uu danda'a.
He’s just a bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa qofa.
It didn’t seem to matter much anymore.	Kana booda baay’ee dhimma kan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
He has spoken many times.	Yeroo hedduu dubbateera.
I don’t think any of you got that idea.	Isin keessaa tokkollee yaada sana waan argate natti hin fakkaatu.
This was no longer my home.	Kun kana booda mana koo hin turre.
I had my own.	Kan koo qaba ture.
He looked at the moment again.	Ammas yeroo sana ilaale.
So we went for it.	Kanaaf deemne.
That’s just one thing.	Waan tokko kana qofa.
I am no different.	Ani adda miti.
Maybe it was just a long time ago.	Tarii yeroo dheeraa dura qofa ta'uu danda'a.
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo miti.
I told him we needed this room.	Kutaa kana akka nu barbaachisu itti hime.
I’m doing that all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas gochaa jira.
I’m still looking up.	Ammallee ol ilaalaa jira.
The prospects don’t look good.	Abdiin jiru gaarii hin fakkaatu.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammadeera.
They were everything that’s bad.	Isaan waan hamaa ta’e hunda turan.
It's going to happen.	Ta'uuf jira.
It took time.	Yeroo fudhate.
How did he find her.	Akkamitti ishee argate.
I love this moment.	Yeroo kana baay'een jaalladha.
He should know.	Beekuu qaba.
He was among them.	Isaan keessaa ture.
He wants to know everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu barbaada.
But that’s okay.	Garuu sun homaa miti.
This is a good episode.	Kun kutaa gaarii dha.
She didn’t like clothes.	Uffata hin jaallattu turte.
Sorry guys.	Dhiifama gurbaa.
It looks good.	Gaarii fakkaata.
I was just like you.	Anis akkuma kee ture.
I don’t know the answer.	Deebii isaa hin beeku.
I don't know much about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beeku.
If not, they should be.	Yoo hin taane ta'uu qabu.
That's all,' he said.	Kana qofa,' jedhe.
They are different, not even human.	Isaan adda adda, nama illee miti.
It really does have.	Dhuguma qaba.
No more waiting nights.	Halkan eegaa kana booda hin jiru.
All you have to do is ask.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu gaafachuu qofa.
That’s how he got the eyes.	Akkasitti ija argate.
That was good enough.	Sun gaarii ture.
At the hope in her eyes.	Abdii ija ishee keessa jiru irratti.
It may not do this, however.	Kana gochuu dhiisuu danda’a garuu.
It was his house.	Mana isaa ture.
It was pretty easy.	Baay'ee salphaa ture.
It’s in everything, everywhere.	Waan hundumaa keessa, bakka hunda keessa jira.
You have it there.	Achitti qabda.
He lives with me.	Na waliin jiraata.
This goes one of two ways.	Kun karaa lama keessaa tokko deema.
This is all known territory.	Kun hundi naannoo beekamaadha.
It may have been just one person.	Nama tokko qofa ture ta'uu danda'a.
In my hands.	Harka koo keessa.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin turre.
No one should have to do that.	Namni tokkollee akkas gochuu hin qabu.
Sometimes I went a long way.	Yeroo tokko tokko karaa dheeraa nan deema ture.
That's why she said it.	Kanaaf jette.
You are not interested in these things.	Wantoota kanaaf fedhii hin qabdu.
But most of the time it doesn't happen.	Garuu yeroo baayyee hin ta'u.
Nothing very important.	Wanti baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru.
You have no chance of that.	Carraa sanaa hin qabdu.
Look inside.	Keessa ilaalaa.
Two children.	Ijoollee lama.
Nothing, but she was great in there.	Homaa miti, garuu achi keessa guddaa turte.
Haven't seen him around here before.	Kana dura naannoo asitti isa hin argine.
I didn't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I need you so much.	Ani baay'een si barbaada.
This is very good.	Kun baayyee gaarii dha.
No one seems to look the part like he does.	Namni kutaa sana akka inni fakkaatu hin fakkaatu.
She was kind of different.	Isheen akka nama adda taate turte.
I say I am extremely accurate.	Ani garmalee sirrii dha jedha.
We can’t do it alone.	Kophaa keenya gochuu hin dandeenyu.
Now I wanted nothing but sleep.	Amma hirriba malee homaa hin barbaanne.
Looks like it won’t happen anytime soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti waan hin taane fakkaata.
I couldn’t believe he wasn’t there.	Inni akka hin jirre amanuu hin dandeenye.
Man does what is necessary.	Namni waan barbaachisu hojjeta.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
That may be important.	Sun barbaachisaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
She's not there.	Isheen hin jirtu.
His and yours.	Kan isaa fi kan kee.
No one talked about it.	Namni waa'ee isaa dubbate hin jiru.
But there’s more to it than that, of course.	Garuu kana caalaa akka jiru beekamaadha.
This is the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kana.
Not sure how that works out.	Sun akkamitti akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
It seems like.	Waan fakkaatu.
Not all is good.	Hundi gaarii miti.
Maybe someone told him.	Tarii namni tokko itti hime ta'a.
It was just mine.	Kan koo qofa ture.
But it just doesn’t exist anymore.	Garuu kana booda hin jiru qofa.
Not so much.	Hamma kana miti.
None of that really matters.	Sana keessaa tokkollee dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
I wasn’t in any mood anymore.	Kana booda miira tokkollee keessa hin turre.
That’s what they need.	Kan isaan barbaachisu kanuma.
They are exactly the same.	Sirriitti wal fakkaatu.
Can't.	Hin danda'u.
He is outside on the road.	Inni ala karaa irra jira.
This can't be that big of a deal.	Kun waan guddaa akkasii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I don’t like guys.	Gurbaa hin jaalladhu.
But it wouldn’t come.	Garuu hin dhufu ture.
It’s just a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa.
I know it’s none of my business.	Dhimma koo akka hin taane nan beeka.
Everything that was wrong, that was me.	Wanti dogoggora ture hundi, sun ana ture.
But that would be too simplistic.	Garuu sun garmalee salphaa ta'a.
He got it right.	Sirriitti argate.
That sounds pretty simple, but it wasn't.	Sun baayyee salphaa fakkaata, garuu hin turre.
About three months.	Gara ji'a sadii.
I think you should know.	Beektu ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
It was his time.	Yeroon isaa yeroo isaa ture.
I don’t need that now.	Amma sun na hin barbaachisu.
I mean, I mean.	Jechuun kooti.
I can have it.	Ani qabaachuu nan danda'a.
She had one too many.	Tokko baay'ee qabdi turte.
They wouldn’t have needed it.	Silaa isaan hin barbaachisu ture.
We just have to stay in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa turuu qofa qabna.
But no one else thought so.	Namni biraa garuu akkas yaade hin jiru.
How is it possible.	Akkamitti danda'ama.
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
I really didn’t want anything.	Dhuguma homaa hin barbaanne.
Just for you.	Siif qofa.
That was the day.	Sun guyyaa ture.
But things weren’t going to stay that way for long.	Garuu wanti yeroo dheeraaf akkas turuuf hin turre.
She was everything to him.	Isheen isaaf waan hundumaa turte.
Now we are in one.	Amma tokko keessa jirra.
' of '.	' kan '.
This one was pretty big though.	Inni kun garuu baayyee guddaa ture.
Try it on.	Irratti yaalaa.
Our work is almost never like that.	Hojiin keenya gonkumaa akkas hin taane jechuun ni danda’ama.
These were the people she went to school with.	Isaan kun namoota isheen waliin mana barumsaa deemtu turan.
I know the area a lot better than you do.	Naannoo sana baay'ee si caalaa beeka.
Now she had two.	Amma lama qabdi turte.
But you are mine now.	Ati garuu amma kan kooti.
I did it again.	Ammas nan godhe.
It certainly wasn’t.	Akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I absolutely love it.	Guutummaatti nan jaalladha.
Tonight, you’re going to help.	Halkan kana, gargaaruuf jirta.
We have enough of him.	Isa gahaa qabna.
Just a little thing.	Waan xiqqoo qofa.
And yet people still go there.	Ammas namoonni ammallee achi deemu.
I was one of them.	Ani tokko ture.
It became a funny part.	Kutaa qoosaa ta'e.
But now he couldn't.	Amma garuu hin dandeenye.
None of us.	Tokkollee keenya.
It worked very well.	Baayyee hojjete.
Which he couldn’t live without.	Kan inni malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
It was never too late.	Gonkumaa yeroon booda hin turre.
Perhaps nothing more is needed.	Tarii kana caalaa wanti barbaachisu hin jiru.
It’s not just an idea.	Yaada qofa miti.
He’s out there, just across the street.	Inni ala jira, karaa biraa qofa.
Everyone had a job, everyone but her.	Namni hundi hojii qaba ture, ishee malee namni hundi.
I had no life before you.	Si dura jireenya hin qabu ture.
But he did it.	Garuu ni godhe.
Do you have any help? 	Gargaarsa qabduu?
20 years ago today.	Waggaa 20 dura har'a.
You will soon know.	Yeroo dhiyootti ni beektu.
It just didn’t do it for me.	Naaf hin goone qofa.
He did his job.	Hojii isaa hojjete.
I had no idea who or where I was going.	Eenyu fi eessa akkan deemu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
So, there is.	Kanaaf, ni jira.
It looked pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
I just looked at them.	Anis isaan ilaale qofa.
Then someone said.	Sana booda namni tokko jedhe.
Now this is my problem.	Amma rakkoon koo kana.
I highly doubt that.	Sana baay'een shakka.
People with ideas.	Namoota yaada qaban.
No one seems to be able to help him.	Namni isa gargaaruu danda'u hin fakkaatu.
Everything was the same.	Wanti hundi tokko ture.
It’s not his time.	Yeroon isaa miti.
Keep this book relevant.	Kitaaba kana barbaachisaa ta’ee eegaa.
Many like him.	Baay'een akkuma isaa.
I was here a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura as ture.
It will be another time and too late.	Yeroo biraa fi yeroon booda ta'a.
Maybe not all of it.	Tarii hunda isaa miti.
I can never tell.	Yoomiyyuu himuu hin danda'u.
The same people.	Namoota wal fakkaatu.
If he gets enough time, he will be great.	Yoo yeroo gahaa argate guddaa ta'a.
I want that right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sana barbaada.
I don’t have a job.	Hojii hin qabu.
This was really good.	Kun dhuguma gaarii ture.
You have just enough time.	Yeroo gahaa qofa qabda.
People do this.	Namoonni kana godhu.
Only, it was there.	Qofa, achi ture.
They are both.	Isaan lamaan.
I love those things.	Wantoota sana nan jaalladha.
We have to stay together.	Waliin turuu qabna.
He wouldn’t have told me.	Silaa natti hin himu ture.
So he thought you might be interested.	Kanaaf fedhii qabaachuu dandeessa jedhee yaade.
He thought it was a hand.	Harka jedhee yaade.
We can't go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
Not as much as the work.	Hanga hojii sanaa miti.
Tell them what they need to know, not what you know.	Waan beektu osoo hin taane waan beekuu qaban itti himi.
I love him but I don’t know what to do.	Ani isa jaalladha malee waanan godhu hin beeku.
I need time to think about it.	Yeroon itti yaadu na barbaachisa.
He wasn’t there for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi hin turre.
You’re not the only one.	Ati qofa miti.
Bad, very bad.	Hamaa, baayyee hamaa.
I knew he had no chance.	Carraa akka hin qabne nan beeka ture.
This was him a year ago.	Kun waggaa tokko dura isa ture.
You just have to get to know her.	Ishee beekuu qofa qabda.
I had no idea what to say.	Maal akka jedhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
She's a good one.	Isheen gaarii dha.
That’s not the real problem.	Rakkoon dhugaa kanuma miti.
He won't come anymore.	Kana booda hin dhufu.
You didn’t want to.	Ati hin barbaanne.
I have you.	Si qaba.
I hadn’t seen him in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isa hin argine ture.
You don’t have to.	Dirqama hin qabdu.
They are on the road.	Karaa irra jiru.
My bad then.	Hamaa koo yeroo sana.
You are working on your ideas.	Yaada keessan irratti hojjechaa jirtu.
Tell him what.	Maal itti himi.
You need a new reason.	Sababa haaraa si barbaachisa.
That said, this wasn’t my favorite.	Kana jechuun, kun kan ani jaalladhu hin turre.
He was with them.	Isaan waliin ture.
Very often.	Baay'ee yeroo baay'ee.
He knew he didn’t have to.	Akka hin qabne beeka ture.
But they will come.	Garuu ni dhufu.
We both did it.	Lamaan keenyayyuu ni goone.
I was being nice about it.	Ani waa'ee isaa gaarii ta'aa ture.
Then he was happy.	Sana booda gammade.
How could it have happened? 	Akkamitti ta'uu danda'a ture?
Nothing happened for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti ta'e hin jiru.
I don't have much time this afternoon.	Har'a waaree booda yeroo baay'ee hin qabu.
This has always been my thing.	Kun yeroo hundumaa wanti kan koo ture.
This is my mother.	Kun haadha kooti.
But only then.	Garuu yeroo sana qofa.
But no one could.	Garuu namni tokkollee hin dandeenye.
It consisted of two rooms.	Kutaa lama of keessaa qaba ture.
Who was it.	Eenyu ture.
Other.	Kan biraa.
I could give you a job.	Hojii siif kennuu nan danda'a ture.
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
Against him, against herself.	Isa irratti, ofii ishee irratti.
This was great.	Kun guddaa ture.
He should know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qaba.
It’s not in anything.	Homaa keessa hin jiru.
Current.	Yeroo ammaa.
You are never going to be completely with them.	Ati gonkumaa guutummaatti isaan waliin ta'uuf hin deemtu.
There is nothing in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa homaa hin jiru.
That worked for the most part.	Sun irra caalaa hojjete.
He was reluctant to admit his mistake.	Dogoggora isaa amanuu irraa duubatti jedhe.
Who knows, it might work.	Eenyu beeka, hojjechuu danda'a.
It's a very good idea.	Yaada baayyee gaarii dha.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
But something happened.	Garuu wanti tokko ta'e.
He should have known.	Beekuu qaba ture.
I enjoyed the work.	Hojiin itti gammade.
He’s not really interested in me.	Dhuguma naaf fedhii hin qabu.
They seem right.	Isaan sirrii fakkaata.
I didn’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beekne.
What they want.	Waan barbaadu.
They don’t care about us.	Isaan nuuf dhimma hin qaban.
He is obvious.	Inni ifaadha.
Why does he say.	Maaliif jedha.
It looked too good to be true.	Garmalee gaarii fakkaata ture.
It seems that must be the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma ta'uu qaba fakkaata.
So, look at it.	Kanaaf, itti ilaalaa.
Maybe it says her name.	Tarii maqaa ishee jedha ta'a.
It can be dangerous.	Balaa qabaachuu danda'a.
From all your friends.	Hiriyyoota keessan hunda irraa.
It will be people he doesn’t have.	Namoota inni hin qabne ta’a.
You're too tall!	Ati baay'ee dheeraa dha!
Totally fine with me.	Naaf guutummaatti gaarii dha.
It was nothing of the sort .	Homaa akkasii hin turre .
I am nothing but home.	Ani mana malee homaa miti.
It would have been the greatest.	Silaa isa guddaa ta'a.
I'm sure it will happen.	Akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha.
Not doing anything.	Homaa gochuu dhiisuu.
That's how it happens.	Akkasitti akkas ta'a.
It’s just wrong like that.	Akkasitti dogoggora qofa.
They know him well.	Isaan akka gaariitti isa beeku.
You have to do what you want.	Waan barbaaddu hojjechuu qabda.
But that’s not what you mean.	Garuu akkas jechuu kee miti.
But how do they do that.	Garuu akkamitti akkas godhu.
I think we need that.	Sana nu barbaachisa jedheen yaada.
This stuff works, right?	Wanti kun ni hojjeta mitiiree?
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
I like that about you.	Waa'ee kee akkas natti tola.
I love that about her.	Waa'ee ishee sana nan jaalladha.
There was a possibility he hadn’t thought of before.	Carraan inni kanaan dura hin yaadne tokko jira ture.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
Certainly not the real one.	Kan dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I hope he does.	Akka godhu abdiin qaba.
But something in me had to do it.	Garuu wanti na keessa jiru tokko gochuu qaba ture.
I couldn't stay.	Turuu hin dandeenye.
Who has this money?	Maallaqa kana eenyutu qaba?
He gave it to me.	Naaf kenne.
It was such a different thing.	Waan akkasii adda ture.
I was just looking at pictures.	Suuraa qofa ilaalaa ture.
No one seems to want to do that.	Namni akkas gochuu barbaadu hin fakkaatu.
I knew it then.	Yeroo sanatti nan beeka ture.
It's not necessarily a good thing.	Waan gaarii ta'uu hin qabu.
I still don't quite know why that happened.	Maaliif akkas ta'e ammallee sirriitti hin beeku.
The bartender looked at me.	Namni mana dhugaatii hojjetu sun na ilaale.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
Here's the night.	Halkan halkan.
We need to know that.	Sana beekuu qabna.
From what? 	Maal irraa?
She knew this and said nothing.	Isheen kana kan beektu homaa hin dubbanne.
If it wasn’t bad before, it was now.	Duraan yoo hamaa hin turre amma ture.
I mean, there is, but it doesn't happen.	Ni jira jechuu kooti, ​​garuu hin ta'u.
I don't know why this is.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
Just one other thing.	Waan biraa tokko qofa.
That hardly mattered.	Sun baay'ee dhimma hin qabu ture.
I love you.	Na jaalladha.
He looked at the moon.	Ji'a ilaale.
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
Certainly not money.	Maallaqa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But you don’t have to.	Garuu dirqama hin qabdu.
That’s not bad.	Sun hamaa miti.
I have no idea what to do.	Waan gochuu qabu yaada hin qabu.
That was pretty big.	Sun baayyee guddaa ture.
That’s not exactly right.	Sun sirriitti sirrii miti.
You have a joke.	Qoosaa tokko qabda.
It will never be enough.	Yoomiyyuu gahaa hin ta'u.
I was just trying to help.	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa ture.
Look closely at the children.	Ijoollee sirriitti ilaalaa.
You’re home, none of that else matters now.	Ati mana jirta, wanti biraa sana keessaa tokkollee amma dhimma hin qabu.
When, of course, he knew nothing.	Yeroo, beekamaadha, inni homaa hin beekne.
This is not for a while.	Kun yeroo muraasaaf miti.
It is not entirely clear.	Guutummaatti ifa miti.
But it’s not working.	Garuu hojjechaa hin jiru.
It was the most important moment of my working life.	Jireenya hojii koo keessatti yeroo hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ture.
They are not like us.	Isaan akka keenya miti.
I wish it were.	Osoo ta'ee natti tola.
No one can do it.	Namni tokkollee hin danda'u.
This was the night.	Halkan kun ture.
That’s what she does.	Kan isheen gootu kanuma.
But otherwise, nothing.	Garuu yoo kana hin taane, homaa miti.
Now he's on his way back.	Amma karaa deebi'uu irra jira.
She was very tall.	Baayyee dheeraa turte.
Just in my imagination.	Yaada koo keessatti qofa.
Who was he looking for.	Eenyu barbaadaa ture.
I mean, you can.	Ni dandeessa jechuu kooti.
But not for long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraaf miti.
None of them are going now.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee amma hin deemu.
Not sorry, sorry.	Dhiifama miti dhiifama.
A bit of luck.	Xiqqoo carraa.
Theirs should be the answer out there for you.	Kan isaanii deebii achi keessaa siif ta'uu qaba.
But I couldn't see him.	Ani garuu isa arguu hin dandeenye.
You can ask questions about a situation in the picture.	Waa’ee haala tokko suuraa irratti gaaffii gaafachuu dandeessa.
As he does.	Akkuma inni godhu.
He said he was watching you.	Si ilaalaa jira jedhe.
I think you know this.	Kana ni beektu jedheen yaada.
Sometimes this doesn’t work.	Yeroo tokko tokko kun hin hojjetu.
So, she had to go all the way home again.	Kanaaf, ammas karaa hundumaa gara manaatti deemuun ishee irra ture.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
Not in life.	Jireenya keessa miti.
It was in her room.	Kutaa ishee keessa ture.
It was just right.	Sirrii qofa ture.
But sometimes it happens.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko ni ta'a.
A real book.	Kitaaba dhugaa.
And I said it, too.	Anis jedheen ture.
How many days today?	Har'a guyyaa meeqa?
It wasn’t just.	Qofa hin taane.
It’s always been good for me.	Yeroo hundumaa naaf gaarii ture.
But it works both ways.	Garuu karaa lamaan hojjeta.
But it was true.	Garuu dhugaa ture.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
But it worked.	Garuu ni hojjete.
It worked really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjete.
But you were right.	Garuu ati sirrii turte.
I don't, I can't.	Hin godhu, hin danda'u.
That may be why nothing happened.	Wanti tokkollee kan hin taane kanaaf taʼuu dandaʼa.
I still want to know.	Ammas beekuu barbaada.
You should have been there.	Silaa achi jiraachuu qabda turte.
I can't do this right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana gochuu hin danda'u.
I could maybe go a little further, but I think that's about right.	Ani tarii xiqqoo deemuu nan danda'a ture, garuu sun sirrii natti fakkaata.
This has never happened before.	Kun kanaan dura ta'ee hin beeku.
But you were there.	Ati garuu achi turte.
Everything is better in the morning.	Wanti hundi ganama wayya.
I can get them for you.	Isaan siif argachuu nan danda'a.
I have no promises though.	Waadaa hin qabu garuu.
It was necessary to say.	Jechuun dirqama ture.
They must be.	Ta'uu qabu.
Not even their clothes.	Uffata isaanii illee miti.
But neither is it.	Garuu lamaan isaaniiyyuu miti.
She couldn’t see me.	Isheen na arguu hin dandeenye.
I wanted to be more than that.	Sana caalaa ta'uu barbaade.
All the good stuff.	Wantoota gaarii hunda.
In this way.	Haala kanaan.
It still doesn't matter.	Ammallee dhimma hin qabu.
I couldn’t be more clear.	Kana caalaa ifa gochuu hin dandeenye.
Tell him again.	Ammas itti himi.
But no one knows any of this.	Garuu kana keessaa tokkollee namni beeku hin jiru.
They would have been.	Silaa ta'u turan.
They are looking for a new home.	Mana haaraa barbaadaa jiru.
He had to do what he had to do.	Waan gochuu qabu gochuu qaba ture.
Everyone had something to say about it.	Namni hundi waa'ee kanaa waan jedhu qaba ture.
They were wrong in this.	Kana keessatti dogoggora turan.
He just asked questions.	Gaaffii qofa gaafate.
They know what happened.	Waan ta'e ni beeku.
It wouldn't be so bad.	Silaa akkas hamaa hin ta'u.
Probably some of the two.	Tarii lamaan keessaa tokko tokko.
Now he’s doing what he loves.	Amma waan jaallatu hojjechaa jira.
A lot of work for nothing.	Hojii baay'ee homaa malee.
You have to believe this.	Kana amanuu qabda.
Everything was possible.	Wanti hundi ni danda'ama ture.
They should have known.	Silaa beekuu qabu turan.
I would have liked to have had it a little longer.	Silaa xiqqoo dheeraa qabaachuu nan barbaada ture.
Maybe she really did.	Tarii dhuguma akkas goote ta'a.
I wanted to know more.	Kana caalaa beekuu barbaade.
But maybe that's okay.	Tarii garuu sun homaa ta'uu danda'a.
In all cases.	Haala hundumaa keessatti.
That's what it should be.	Kana ta'uu qaba.
It doesn't look good.	Gaarii hin fakkaatu.
Most of the time there was no problem.	Yeroo baayyee rakkoon hin turre.
I don’t want him to know this.	Kana akka inni beeku hin barbaadu.
I knew he was a bad man.	Nama hamaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture.
I wasn’t there for that either.	Anis kanaaf hin turre.
Now a few of them.	Amma isaan keessaa muraasa.
He never knew it.	Inni gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
Very good indeed.	Dhuguma baayyee gaarii dha.
He likes to do some things, but not too much.	Waan tokko tokko hojjechuu ni jaallata, garuu baay'ee miti.
France and.	Faransaayii fi.
He had a few problems at the time.	Yeroo sanatti rakkoo muraasa qaba ture.
It was all the same for us.	Hundi isaa nuuf tokko ture.
Good job on this one!.	Isa kana irratti hojii gaarii!.
She was younger than her friends.	Hiriyyoota ishee irraa xiqqoo turte.
I have a lot of questions.	Gaaffii baay'een qaba.
No one understood.	Namni hubate hin jiru.
He could fill it.	Inni guutuu danda'a ture.
It would have been a little.	Silaa xiqqoo ture.
As good as it got at the time.	Akkuma yeroo sanatti argate gaarii.
He told her she was wrong.	Dogoggora akka qabdu itti hime.
Everything he said seemed absolutely right.	Wanti inni dubbate hundi guutummaatti sirrii fakkaata ture.
I was home all week.	Torban guutuu mana ture.
It just doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu qofa.
It was just the girl with him.	Intala isa waliin jirtu qofa ture.
Everything was fine.	Hundi gaarii ture.
He said they would.	Ni godhu jedhe.
There was nothing he could do.	Wanti inni gochuu danda'u hin turre.
But he knew he had to do something.	Garuu waan tokko gochuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
You’re right.	Ati dhugaa.
How does this work?	Kun akkamitti hojjeta?
One thought! 	Yaada tokko!
he says.	jedha.
I'm not those things.	Ani wantoota sana hin ta'u.
Nothing happened in the bar.	Mana dhugaatii keessatti wanti ta'e hin jiru.
It’s after one.	Tokko booda dha.
But there could have been.	Garuu jiraachuu danda'a ture.
They have no idea how this could happen.	Kun akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qaban.
They all knew who he was.	Hundi isaanii eenyu akka ta'e beeku turan.
That doesn’t work this time.	Sun yeroo kana hin hojjetu.
Then he went away.	Sana booda deeme.
Everyone should do that.	Namni hundi akkas gochuu qaba.
It is, of course.	Akka ta’e beekamaadha.
Keep yours	Kee eegaa
I want you to know that for sure.	Sana mirkanaa'aa ta'ee akka beektu nan barbaada.
That wasn’t entirely accurate.	Sun guutummaatti sirrii hin turre.
I like the light of this one.	Ifa isa kanaa natti tola.
She had everything she needed here.	Asitti waan ishee barbaachisu hunda qabdi turte.
But there you are.	Garuu achi jirta.
This is really important to us.	Kun dhuguma nuuf barbaachisaa dha.
She made it work.	Akka hojjetu goote.
I can work all day.	Guyyaa guutuu hojjechuu nan danda'a.
We are in this together.	Kana keessa waliin jirra.
I think this is right.	Kun sirrii natti fakkaata.
You’re doing a great job here.	Asitti hojii guddaa hojjechaa jirta.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammadeera.
He was still in great shape.	Ammas haala guddaa keessa ture.
It must have been very catchy.	Baay'ee nama qaba ture ta'uu qaba.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun akkas miti.
So far we seem to be doing well.	Hanga ammaatti waan gaarii hojjechaa jirra fakkaata.
But it will be a great thing.	Garuu waan guddaa ta'a.
So sorry for that.	Kanaaf dhiifama kanaaf.
That’s a possibility.	Sun ta’uu danda’a.
But that wasn’t enough.	Garuu sun gahaa hin turre.
I am three years old.	Umuriin koo waggaa sadii dha.
I can do this without my father.	Abbaa koo malee kana gochuu nan danda'a.
Just like my mother.	Akkuma haadha kooti.
Not my favorite.	Kan ani jaalladhu miti.
People know this place.	Bakka kana namoonni ni beeku.
They want us to do this.	Kana akka goonu barbaadu.
It's happening now.	Amma ta'aa jira.
We still don’t have enough.	Ammallee gahaa hin qabnu.
We have to be.	Ta'uu qabna.
That's how it happened, he said.	Akkas ta'e jedhe.
We’re all doing well here.	Hundi keenya asitti waan gaarii hojjechaa jirra.
I could have done better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture.
That wasn't really what happened.	Dhuguma wanti ta'e sun hin turre.
But of course.	Garuu beekamaadha.
None of it matters.	Isa keessaa tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
he wanted to know.	jedhee beekuu barbaade.
You only have one life.	Jireenya tokko qofa qabda.
Maybe too fresh.	Tarii garmalee haaraa ta'uu danda'a.
He knows exactly where he is.	Eessa akka jiru sirriitti beeka.
No one else had said that.	Namni biraa akkas jedhe hin turre.
You can’t do that with kids.	Ijoollee wajjin akkas gochuu hin dandeessu.
It says that.	Akkas jedha.
I wish things were different.	Osoo wanti tokko adda ta'ee natti tola.
Clearly, it is not.	Akka hin taane ifaadha.
It would have been like	Silaa akka .
It even has a door.	Balbala illee qaba.
Very likely.	Baay'ee hin oolu.
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
That didn’t matter now.	Sun amma dhimma hin qabu ture.
Everything and everyone.	Waan hundumaa fi nama hunda.
Three years later.	Waggaa sadii booda.
Look at her.	Ishee ilaalaa.
That stuff is dangerous.	Wanti sun balaa qaba.
I have no idea how to go about doing this.	Kana gochuuf akkamitti akkan deemu yaada hin qabu.
Here's a dog here.	Halkan halkan saree.
I looked into his eyes.	Anis ija isaa keessa ilaale.
Not in a week.	Torban tokko keessatti miti.
You had me.	Ati na qabda turte.
Your hands, your big hands.	Harka kee, harka kee guddaa.
I couldn’t do that now.	Amma akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
He has to eat something.	Waan tokko nyaachuu qaba.
So this is for you.	Kanaaf kun siif ta'a.
I think you are.	Ati akka jirtu natti fakkaata.
You better hope she’s not us.	Isheen nu akka hin taane abdii qabaachuu wayya.
I hadn't thought about that.	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne ture.
She doesn't seem to have it.	Kan qabdu hin fakkaatu.
They are all the same.	Hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu.
it seems to have to have.	qabaachuu waan qabu fakkaata.
I think he got her.	Ishee argate natti fakkaata.
It was my father.	Abbaa koo ture.
Sometimes this can help with clarity.	Yeroo tokko tokko kun ifa ta’uuf gargaaruu danda’a.
So far this works great.	Hanga ammaatti kun waan guddaa hojjeta.
Just bad luck.	Carraa hamaa qofa.
You are still working.	Ammas hojjechaa jirta.
What exactly that looks like is up to us.	Sun sirriitti maal akka fakkaatu kan keenya.
I mean, sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko jechuu kooti.
I have been working on her.	Ishee irratti hojjechaa tureera.
Not much, but a little.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane xiqqoo.
Just like it didn’t happen a year ago.	Akkuma waggaa tokko dura hin taane.
It was in excellent condition.	Haala gaarii keessa ture.
But we are ourselves.	Nuti garuu ofii keenya.
Now it will be different.	Amma adda ta'a.
You could see what it did to him.	Maal akka isa godhe arguu dandeessa turte.
In her case it was more than that.	Dhimma ishee irratti kana caalaa ture.
Glad to see him.	Isa arguu kootti gammadeera.
Really, I couldn’t believe I hadn’t seen it before.	Dhuguma, kana dura akka hin argine amanuu hin dandeenye.
I would say the same thing.	Silaa kanuma nan jedha.
Nothing would be easy.	Silaa wanti salphaa ta'u hin jiru.
You know my situation now.	Haala koo amma beekta.
It does this.	Kana godha.
But there is a problem.	Garuu rakkoon jira.
As if he didn't speak.	Akka waan hin dubbanne.
It has all the issues.	Dhimma hunda qaba.
That other one .	Kan biraa sana .
But one wants to know more about its positive aspects.	Garuu namni tokko waa’ee wantoota gaarii inni qabu caalaatti beekuu barbaada.
Here on the road .	As karaa irratti .
Not now, soon.	Amma miti, dafee.
No one really knew what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru dhuguma namni beeku hin turre.
Now, there is no clear answer.	Amma, deebii ifa ta'e hin jiru.
You both need it.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu isin barbaachisa.
I would never do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
We are not our own.	Nuti kan keenya miti.
Everyone knew this, everyone knew it at the time.	Kana namni hundi ni beeka, yeroo sanatti namni hundi ni beeka ture.
It certainly wasn’t his.	Kan isaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
It was very nice there.	Achitti baayyee namatti tola ture.
It seems to be on its way.	Karaa irra waan jiru fakkaata.
Not everyone goes that route, though.	Namni hundi karaa sana hin deemu garuu.
I have this.	Ani kana qaba.
It would have been great.	Silaa guddaa ture.
You can't say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin dandeessu.
Not playing on them, of course.	Isaan irratti taphachuu dhiisuu, beekamaadha.
This is what she looks like.	Kan isheen fakkaattu kana.
I want this not to be true.	Kun dhugaa akka hin taane nan barbaada.
There is still a problem.	Ammas rakkoon tokko jira.
Not sure they were there.	Achi akka turan mirkanaa'aa miti.
Not a very tall man.	Nama baayyee dheeraa hin taane.
No one had gone there.	Namni achi deeme hin jiru ture.
They make you new.	Haaraa si godhu.
It wasn’t something that was easy.	Wanti salphaa ture hin turre.
Look at it as I do.	Akka kootti ilaalaa.
There is only one problem.	Rakkoon tokko qofa.
He has to go.	Deemuu qaba.
Look at my dog!	Saree koo ilaalaa!
Not a good place to be.	Bakka gaarii ta'uu miti.
I have a lot of questions about this.	Waa'ee kanaa gaaffii baay'een qaba.
No one would tell me why.	Maaliif akka ta'e namni natti himu hin jiru ture.
I am really pleased with myself.	Ani dhuguma ofitti gammadeera.
You have two problems.	Rakkoo lama qabda.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	Ana osoo hin taane si ta'uu kootti gammadeera.
He did nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin goone.
He made a mistake.	Dogoggora hojjete.
A part of her.	Kutaa ishee tokko.
But this is my problem.	Garuu rakkoon koo kana.
Like a week later.	Akka torban tokko booda.
He was older than me and mine was here.	Ana caalaa umuriin isaa fi kan koo as ture.
But we are watching.	Garuu ilaalaa jirra.
I know two of them to some extent.	Isaan keessaa lama hamma tokko beeka.
I know you very well.	Ani baay'ee si beeka.
Now you can comment.	Amma yaada kennuu dandeessu.
I thought there was something.	Waan tokko jira jedheen yaade.
She is a good girl.	Intala gaarii dha.
But everyone was just staring at him.	Garuu namni hundi ija keessa isa qofa ilaalaa ture.
This will be my job.	Kun hojii koo ta'a.
The prospects are bright.	Abdiin jiru ifaadha.
I could have been.	Ani ta'uu nan danda'a ture.
I said that just yesterday.	Akkas jedheen kaleessa qofa.
That is not your business.	Sun dhimma keessan miti.
That must be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta’uu qaba.
I already do it.	Ani duruu nan godha.
It was just an idea.	Yaada qofa ture.
It can still work.	Ammas hojjechuu danda'a.
It must be returned.	Deebi'uu qaba.
I wasn’t really watching anything.	Dhuguma homaa ilaalaa hin turre.
I knew this was true.	Kun dhugaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
But that’s okay.	Garuu sun homaa miti.
Even my father.	Abbaa koo illee.
I think it is possible.	Ni danda'ama jedheen yaada.
It looked big and dangerous.	Guddaa fi balaa kan qabu fakkaata ture.
You need one.	Tokko si barbaachisa.
I can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin danda'u.
But of course he had.	Garuu beekamaadha qaba ture.
Now even that was within his reach.	Amma sun illee harka isaa keessa ture.
I knew it perfectly.	Ani guutummaatti beeka ture.
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
I really love him.	Dhuguma isa jaalladha.
It was just everything.	Waan hundumaa qofa ture.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
Now we can’t do any more.	Amma kana caalaa hin dandeenyu.
I know you, now.	Si beeka, amma.
How can we help these people?	Namoota kana gargaaruu kan dandeenyu akkamitti?
We didn’t agree before.	Duraan walii hin galle turre.
There wasn’t enough stuff.	Wanti gahaa hin turre.
If it were.	Osoo ta'ee.
See in three months maybe.	Mee ilaalaa ji'a sadii booda tarii.
I was a local.	Ani nama naannoo sanaa ture.
There was no problem.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin turre.
Like, like more, like.	Akka, akka caalaa, akka.
I knew little of it.	Ani waan xiqqoo beeku ture.
Like meeting each other.	Akka wal arguu.
It still needs some work.	Ammas hojii tokko tokko barbaada.
I love you more than life.	Jireenya caalaa si jaalladha.
Something no one saw coming.	Waan namni tokkollee dhufuu hin argine.
Probably never see many of them again.	Tarii kana booda baay'ee isaanii arguu hin danda'u.
Today, of course, things were a little different.	Har’a wanti xiqqoo adda akka ture beekamaadha.
I can't do it today.	Har'a hin danda'u.
I thought it was probably from the noise.	Sagalee irraa ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaade.
I didn't even know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture.
She said he looked good.	Inni gaarii fakkaata jette.
It seemed out of place now.	Amma bakka hin qabne fakkaata ture.
That wasn’t all.	Kana qofa hin turre.
To do that, you need to know who that is.	Sana gochuuf sun eenyu akka taʼe beekuu qabda.
That has never happened before.	Kana dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
Once he saw them.	Yeroo tokko isaan arge.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
You can leave it all night.	Halkan guutuu dhiisuu dandeessa.
I had no reason not to.	Sababni akkan hin goone hin qabu ture.
That's not happening.	Sun ta'aa hin jiru.
He asked an obvious question.	Gaaffii ifa ta'e gaafate.
I was alone in this little room.	Kutaa xiqqoo kana keessa kophaa koo ture.
You are all alone.	Hundi keessan kophaa keessan.
Usually not very often.	Yeroo baayyee baay'ee miti.
She couldn’t have it.	Isheen qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe even better.	Tarii kana caalaa gaarii ta'a.
I couldn't find it now.	Amma argachuu hin dandeenye.
He had little to say.	Inni waan jedhu xiqqoo qaba ture.
I am the one right now.	Ani isa yeroo ammaa kana.
You’re just doing your job.	Hojii kee qofa hojjechaa jirta.
They had the same feeling.	Miira tokko qaban turan.
I can't live without you.	Si malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
I knew this was a big problem.	Kun rakkoo guddaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
We have a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee qabna.
This couldn’t be good.	Kun gaarii ta’uu hin dandeenye.
I just didn’t want to see them again.	Ammas isaan arguu qofa hin barbaanne.
Not someone she didn’t even know.	Nama isheen illee hin beekne miti.
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
That's what I was doing.	Kana gochuun ture.
This is now.	Kun amma.
This will be a long night for him.	Kun halkan dheeraa isaaf ta'a.
But her new idea.	Garuu yaada ishee haaraa.
No one asked him any questions.	Namni gaaffii tokkollee isa gaafate hin jiru.
I always say it.	Yeroo hundumaa nan jedha.
I will say it again.	Ammas nan jedha.
He had no children.	Ijoollee hin qabu ture.
If you are.	Yoo taate.
What should we do? 	Maal gochuu qabna?
I have to go so bad.	Akkas hamaa deemuun qaba.
I really really want it.	Dhuguma dhuguma barbaada.
Three months of the year at best.	Waggaa keessaa ji'a sadii yoo gaarii ta'e.
It couldn't have been.	Ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
There is no other.	Kan biraa hin jiru.
She was older.	Isheen umuriin ishee guddaa ture.
He usually works at home.	Yeroo baayyee mana keessatti hojjeta.
It’s not my opinion.	Yaada koo miti.
That's exactly what happened.	Kan ta'e sirriitti kanuma.
He was very nice.	Inni baay'ee namatti tola ture.
The only thing you can be is you.	Wanti ati ta'uu dandeessu si qofa.
But he didn't.	Garuu hin goone.
These were the ones.	Isaan kun turan.
Who knows, maybe they will.	Eenyutu beeka tarii ni ta'u.
Not sure about that.	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
He gave it to me.	Naaf kenne.
Who did it.	Kan godhe.
You have to leave me alone.	Na dhiisuu qabda.
I wish it were true.	Osoo dhugaa ta'ee natti tola.
Really, really nice.	Dhuguma, dhuguma namatti tola.
I am very, very good.	Ani baayyee baayyee gaarii dha.
And it’s still the same.	Ammas kanuma.
Where are we going?	Eessa deemaa jirra?
The current one still works.	Kan ammaa ammas ni hojjeta.
Only it was so much more than that.	Qofa kana caalaa baayyee ture.
Look at us now.	Amma nu ilaalaa.
It’s never that simple.	Gonkumaa akkas salphaa miti.
We’re just in it.	Nuti qofa keessa jirra.
Not sure what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
It doesn't look good.	Gaarii hin fakkaatu.
He really needs to work on that.	Dhuguma sana irratti hojjechuu qaba.
Check out the full episode.	Guutuu isaa ilaalaa.
We are at her house later that night.	Halkan sana booda mana ishee jirra.
With my children.	Ijoollee koo waliin.
But it doesn't seem likely.	Garuu waan ta'uu danda'u hin fakkaatu.
Nothing happened for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti tokkollee hin taane.
It was that simple.	Akkasitti salphaa ture.
Does anyone know anything?	Namni waan beeku jiraa?
It was a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa ture.
That time is now.	Yeroon sun amma.
He is waiting for him.	Isa eegaa jira.
Three days ago.	Guyyaa sadii dura.
That was mine we.	Sun kan koo ture nuti.
I know who it is.	Eenyu nan beeka.
Who owns this house?	Mana kana eenyutu qaba?
It may not be the perfect way.	Karaa guutuu ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
Certainly his eyes.	Mirkanaa'aa ija isaa.
You could not be more wrong.	Kana caalaa dogoggora taʼuu hin dandeessu.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
Maybe even up to three.	Tarii hanga sadii illee ta'uu danda'a.
That's probably why.	Kanaaf ta'uu hin oolu.
But nobody does that.	Garuu namni akkas godhu hin jiru.
I think it would have worked.	Silaa ni hojjeta jedheen yaada.
But you are different.	Ati garuu adda.
They have a house.	Mana qabu.
I always knew it.	Yeroo hundumaa nan beeka ture.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
She couldn’t see her father.	Abbaa ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
You are my only hope.	Ati qofa abdii kooti.
He has something to say.	Waan jedhu qaba.
But he doesn't.	Garuu hin godhu.
It’s all in their hands.	Hundi isaa harka isaanii jira.
Not exact but it was true.	Sirrii miti garuu dhugaa ture.
He didn't.	Hin goone.
He seemed nice enough.	Inni nama gaarii gahaa fakkaata ture.
That’s when it came to me.	Yeroo sana natti dhufe.
But now you know.	Amma garuu beekta.
What more do we need, really.	Kana caalaa maaltu nu barbaachisa, dhuguma.
I thought you were.	Ati natti fakkaate.
I hadn't been there two weeks when this happened.	Yeroon kun ta'u torban lama achi hin turre.
You are a human being.	Ati nama dha.
There must be something she can do to help him.	Wanti isheen isa gargaaruu dandeessu tokko jiraachuu qaba.
It was my job.	Hojii koo ture.
He has someone else.	Nama biraa qaba.
He thought no one knew.	Namni hin beeku jedhee yaade.
Sometimes, it works.	Yeroo tokko tokko, ni hojjeta.
He certainly wasn't feeling well today.	Har'a miira gaarii akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
I want to go.	Ani deemuun barbaada.
I still feel good about it.	Ammallee miira gaarii qaba.
People like him.	Namoonni akka isaa.
Someone was watching her that morning.	Ganama sana namni tokko ishee ilaalaa ture.
She wants nothing more to do with him.	Kana caalaa waan isa waliin qabdu hin barbaaddu.
Some work that is.	Hojii tokko tokko jechuun.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
It’s the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii dha.
She didn’t know what she wanted to say.	Waan jechuu barbaaddu hin beektu turte.
People help each other.	Namoonni wal gargaaru.
He is not dangerous.	Inni balaa hin qabu.
Because no one knows.	Sababni isaa namni beeku hin jiru.
I can do this.	Kana gochuu nan danda'a.
There is nothing more.	Kana caalaa wanti jiru hin jiru.
It’s not an easy thing.	Waan salphaa miti.
Sometimes he is right.	Yeroo tokko tokko sirrii dha.
But, that's what's happening.	Garuu, kan ta'aa jiru kanuma.
He was above that sort of thing.	Inni waan akkasii sanaa ol ture.
Two weeks of the year are great around here!.	Torban lama waggaa keessaa naannoo asitti baay'ee gaarii dha!.
She didn’t love him enough.	Isheen gahaa isa hin jaallattu turte.
We still have this.	Ammallee kana qabna.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
Until then, there wasn't much he could do.	Hanga sanatti waan guddaa hojjechuu danda'u hin turre.
He didn’t speak for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin dubbanne.
This seems about right.	Kun waa'ee sirrii fakkaata.
There seemed to be none.	Tokkollee hin turre fakkaata ture.
Everything else was great.	Wanti biraa hundi guddaa ture.
He certainly doesn’t have time.	Yeroo akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
I didn’t like any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jaalladhu ture.
Perhaps nothing could.	Tarii wanti dandaʼu hin jiru taʼa.
It’s time for you to go.	Yeroon ati deemtu amma.
In her eyes.	Ija ishee keessatti.
You don’t want to know the name.	Maqaa beekuu hin barbaaddu.
I know how that works.	Sun akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka.
I hope I am forgiven.	Dhiifama akkan ta'u abdiin qaba.
This is what happened here tonight.	Halkan kana asitti kan ta'e kana.
I don’t know how to do this.	Kana akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
I didn't understand either.	Anis naaf hin galle.
There is only one problem.	Rakkoon tokko qofa.
It should last a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa turuu qaba.
I hadn't seen him in hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf isa hin argine ture.
It was something to say.	Waan jedhu ture.
It was a great little job.	Hojii xiqqoo guddaa ture.
I can't do it alone.	Kophaa koo hojjechuu hin danda'u.
I'm not so sure though.	Ani garuu hangas mirkanaa'aa miti.
This was bad enough for him.	Kun isaaf hamaa gahaa ture.
There's always something he can do.	Yeroo hundumaa wanti inni hojjechuu danda'u jira.
He had a lot of work to do.	Hojii baayʼee hojjechuu qaba ture.
That was enough to make it happen.	Kana jechuun akka ta’u gochuuf gahaa ture.
But just look at this stuff.	Garuu waan kana qofa ilaalaa.
I know the place well.	Bakka sana sirriitti beeka.
Not so in this book.	Kitaaba kana keessatti akkas miti.
You can never tell.	Gonkumaa himuu hin dandeessu.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
She was with them.	Isaan waliin turte.
She was very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola turte.
One day.	Guyyaa tokko.
You know what you are now.	Maal akka taate amma beekta.
There is no real reason.	Sababni dhugaa hin qabu.
It’s not a place.	Bakka miti.
Being.	Ta'uu.
It's usually better not to see them.	Yeroo baayyee isaan arguu dhiisuu wayya.
But he didn't do much work.	Garuu hojii baay'ee hin hojjenne.
He took her hand in his.	Harka ishee kan isaa keessa fudhate.
I know him so well.	Ani akka malee isa beeka.
Not sure there is anything else.	Waan biraa akka jiru mirkanaa'aa miti.
' have '.	' qaba '.
But this is not about that.	Garuu kun waa'ee sanaa miti.
I don't want to know anything about them.	Waa'ee isaanii homaa beekuu hin barbaadu.
No one knew what to do.	Namni maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
She may not have noticed.	Isheen hin hubanne taʼa.
You don’t need a reason.	Sababni si hin barbaachisu.
Please, no more.	Maaloo, kana booda hin ta'u.
You know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'u beekta.
It is necessary to know.	Beekuu barbaachisa.
He has a job.	Hojii qaba.
She became a teacher.	Barsiisaa taate.
Sometimes you can’t even believe your eyes.	Yeroo tokko tokko ija kee illee amanuu hin dandeessu.
I don't even know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
This is certainly the case.	Kun akka ta’e beekamaadha.
This happens sometimes.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko ni ta’a.
This was going to happen sooner.	Kun dafee ta'uuf ture.
Most of the time it doesn't matter much.	Yeroo baayyee baayyee dhimma hin qabu.
They are not entirely wrong.	Guutummaatti dogoggora hin qaban.
But it was nothing to him.	Isaaf garuu homaa hin turre.
It may not be good, but it's there.	Gaarii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a, garuu achi jira.
It’s not something like that.	Waan akkasii miti.
Not good enough so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii miti.
But in all reality it is not.	Garuu dhugaa jiru hundumaa keessatti akkas miti.
It was right.	Sirrii ture.
Even from himself.	Ofii irraa illee.
It was just the truth.	Dhugaa ture qofa.
She was different.	Isheen adda turte.
I thought it didn’t happen.	Anis hin taane jedheen yaade.
So no problem there.	Kanaaf achitti rakkoon hin jiru.
It did, but only slightly.	Ni godhe, garuu xiqqoo qofa.
That’s how it goes here.	Asitti akkasitti deema.
He should have stayed with him.	Silaa isa bira turuu qaba ture.
It's just an accident.	Balaa qofa.
It’s not an idea.	Yaada miti.
It must be you.	Si ta'uu qaba.
There was nothing there.	Achitti wanti jiru hin turre.
Nothing too much, please.	Homaa garmalee hin jiru maaloo.
It’s not entirely clear what exactly happened.	Wanti sirriitti ta’e guutummaatti ifa miti.
It can’t be anything.	Homaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
Maybe he didn't.	Tarii hin goone ta'a.
Everyone wanted to do more.	Namni hundi kana caalaa hojjechuu barbaada ture.
This was not the case in her time.	Yeroo ishee keessatti kun hin turre.
So we would have had that.	Kanaaf silaa sana qabna turre.
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
I really had it.	Ani dhuguma qaba ture.
A month ago, even better.	Ji'a tokko dura, kana caalaa gaarii dha.
We were there for a few hours.	Sa'aatii muraasaaf achi turre.
It does work.	Ni hojjeta.
It doesn't happen, though.	Hin ta'u garuu.
I love you, you know that.	Si jaalladha, ati kana beekta.
I know what his job is.	Hojiin isaa maal akka ta'e nan beeka.
Sometimes that happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas taʼa.
That’s very…	Sun baayyee...
I'm sure, like me.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha, akkuma koo.
I knew this a long time ago.	Kana yeroo dheeraa dura beeka ture.
Maybe there's a chance.	Tarii carraan jiraachuu danda'a.
He is mine.	Inni kan kooti.
They have no idea of ​​it.	Isaan keessaa yaada tokkollee hin qaban.
We can’t say we wanted them.	Isaan barbaanne jechuu hin dandeenyu.
I wanted nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin barbaanne.
It was still early.	Ammallee dafee ture.
Now he was interested.	Amma fedhii qaba ture.
We’re just doing our job.	Hojii keenya qofa hojjechaa jirra.
But no one will ever know this.	Garuu namni kana gonkumaa hin beeku.
Why is this happening?	Kun maaliif ta'aa jira?
But there weren't many.	Garuu baay'een hin turre.
Only one can help.	Gargaaruu kan danda'u tokko qofa.
Not even a little bit.	Xiqqoo illee miti.
Everyone around here knows it.	Namni naannoo as jiru hundi ni beeka.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
Sometimes I think that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas jedheen yaada.
There is no problem there.	Achitti rakkoon hin jiru.
But now, it's going to be different.	Amma garuu, adda ta'uuf deema.
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
Then again, maybe.	Sana booda ammas tarii ta'uu danda'a.
They can live without money.	Maallaqa malee jiraachuu danda'u.
That should help.	Sun gargaaruu qaba.
Their timing was excellent.	Yeroon isaanii baayyee gaarii ture.
But he doesn't seem to do that.	Kana garuu waan godhu hin fakkaatu.
I didn’t know what to do in there.	Achi keessa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
You would love it.	Ni jaallattu turte.
I could never buy what she said.	Waan isheen jette gonkumaa bitachuu hin dandeenye.
Two things about this though.	Waa'ee kanaa garuu waan lama.
We all need to work together.	Hundi keenya waliin hojjechuu qabna.
He has something to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu qaba.
I think we made that clear.	Sana ifa goone natti fakkaata.
I didn't want to go back to my room.	Gara kutaa kootti deebi'uu hin barbaanne.
Much, much, more.	Baay'ee, baay'ee, caalaa.

He wasn’t interested in going with her.	Ishee waliin deemuuf fedhii hin qabu ture.

But that was enough.	Garuu sun gahaa ture.
Anything good could have happened later.	Silaa waan gaarii tokkollee booda ta'uu danda'a ture.
So you have kids with a lot of money.	Kanaaf ijoollee maallaqa guddaa qaban qabda.
No one has ever seen him do that.	Namni akkas godhu arge hin jiru.
But you are different.	Garuu ati adda.
He needs to know who did this.	Eenyu akka kana godhe beekuu qaba.
That’s what you expect.	Kanuma eegaa.
But she’s not the best.	Garuu isheen hunda caalaa miti.
It must be really great.	Dhuguma guddaa ta'uu qaba.
Consider this question.	Gaaffii kana ilaalaa.
But I couldn’t quit now.	Garuu amma dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
No one seems to know exactly why.	Sababni isaa sirriitti namni beeku hin jiru fakkaata.
I’m looking for my daughter.	Intala koo barbaadaa jira.
It must be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu qaba.
It wasn't good.	Gaarii hin turre.
We just have to find it.	Argachuu qofa qabna.
About a lot of things.	Waa'ee waan baay'ee.
I certainly enjoyed it.	Ani akkan itti gammade beekamaadha.
Night, however, was his favorite time.	Halkan garuu yeroo inni baayʼee jaallatu ture.
It is a very good location.	Bakka baayyee gaarii dha.
He was important, but she hardly knew him.	Inni barbaachisaa ture, garuu isheen baayʼee isa hin beektu turte.
If you don't know.	Yoo hin beekne.
I just want to.	Ani qofa barbaada.
Probably too many.	Garmalee baay'ee ta'uu hin oolu.
He’s the only one.	Inni qofa.
Fortunately, this is entirely possible.	Akka carraa ta'ee kun guutummaatti ni danda'ama.
This is a good job.	Kun hojii gaarii dha.
It seems to be happening a lot.	Baay'ee waan ta'aa jiru fakkaata.
But look inside the car.	Garuu konkolaataa keessa ilaalaa.
She just had a bad feeling about the whole situation.	Haala sana hunda irratti miira hamaa qofa qabdi turte.
We don’t do this right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana kana hin goonu.
And.	Fi.
You are unique and special.	Ati adda fi adda taate.
Look at your mouth.	Mee afaan keessan ilaalaa.
We need new money.	Maallaqa haaraa nu barbaachisa.
He knew them very well.	Inni baay'ee isaan beeka ture.
This may be true.	Kun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I was still in school.	Ammallee mana barumsaa ture.
She didn’t have it.	Isheen hin qabdu turte.
I don't think that happened.	Akkas ta'e natti hin fakkaatu.
No book looks good.	Kitaaba gaarii fakkaatu hin jiru.
You just know them.	Ati qofa isaan beekta.
But that was great.	Garuu sun guddaa ture.
She needs to know her place.	Bakka ishee beekuu qabdi.
There is no one out here.	As ala namni hin jiru.
There was nothing else.	Wanti biraa hin turre.
We were	Nuti turre .
There is only one thing.	Wanti tokko qofa.
But they are somewhat similar.	Garuu hamma tokko wal fakkaatu.
That's when it happened.	Yeroo sana ture kan ta'e.
It was last year.	Bara darbe ture.
He had nothing else.	Waan biraa hin qabu ture.
This, of course, is not correct.	Kun, sirrii akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I am not a mother either.	Anis haadha miti.
Look at what they have.	Waan qaban ilaalaa.
She needs all the help she can get.	Gargaarsa argachuu dandeessu hunda ishee barbaachisa.
It could be something else though.	Waan biraa ta'uu danda'a garuu.
You didn’t need it .	Si hin barbaachifne .
You know it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa ni beekta.
You can go back again.	Ammas duubatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
You have to believe it.	Amanuu qabda.
I don't really understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e dhuguma naaf hin galle.
The job kept me busy.	Hojiin sun akkan hin hojjenne na godhe.
Really, it’s not that bad.	Dhuguma, hangas hamaa miti.
But I wanted to know more.	Garuu kana caalaa beekuu barbaade.
I didn't want to tell you.	Akkan sitti himu hin barbaanne.
But he knew what to do.	Garuu waan godhu beeka ture.
What you want is there.	Wanti ati barbaaddu achi jira.
No one knew her.	Namni ishee beeku hin turre.
She had enough of this.	Kana gahaa qabdi turte.
Simple ideas.	Yaada salphaa.
But she wasn't.	Isheen garuu hin turre.
You know, with a girl.	Beektaa, intala waliin.
Sometimes I like that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas natti tola.
He couldn't help us.	Nu gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
Please just wait.	Mee eegaa qofa.
A month, maybe.	Ji'a tokko, tarii.
He must see and feel.	Arguu fi miira qabaachuu qaba.
It’s in the wrong place.	Bakka hin taane keessa jira.
Something must be wrong.	Wanti tokko dogoggora taʼuu qaba.
You don’t like that.	Ati akkas hin jaallattu.
It's not on anything else.	Waan biraa irra hin jiru.
Simplicity, what simplicity.	Salphaa ta'uu, maal salphaa ta'uu.
They looked good together.	Waliin gaarii fakkaatu turan.
It was a good one.	Gaarii ture.
But it certainly happens.	Garuu akka ta'u beekamaadha.
Not sure how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
He had no idea what he was doing.	Maal akka hojjetu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I don't know if it's true or not.	Dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
Anyone here have an answer?.	Asitti namni deebii qabu jiraa?.
This is not true at all.	Kun tasumaa dhugaa miti.
Last year he had no help.	Bara darbe gargaarsa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I can do it alone.	Kophaa koo hojjechuu nan danda'a.
Everyone has an opinion though.	Namni hundi yaada qaba garuu.
I don't want to do it.	Ani gochuu hin barbaadu.
Great job.	Hojii guddaa.
What did he say?	Maal jedhe?
This risks becoming something much bigger.	Kun waan kana caalaa guddaa ta’uuf balaa qaba.
It was about what you didn't see.	Waa'ee waan ati hin argine ture.
It can't be too bad.	Waan garmalee hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
He was waiting for them.	Isaan eegaa ture.
You don't have to do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin qabdu.
She has many dogs.	Saree hedduu qabdi.
It doesn't do anything.	Homaa hin godhu.
I can see them now.	Amma isaan arguu nan danda'a.
It would have been much easier that way.	Silaa akkasitti baayyee salphaa ture.
Some people think that’s a problem.	Namoonni tokko tokko sun rakkoo natti fakkaata.
I know he’s just doing his job.	Hojii isaa qofa akka hojjetu nan beeka.
This was her case.	Kun dhimma ishee ture.
He may say something important.	Waan barbaachisaa taʼe tokko dubbachuu dandaʼa.
So he went away.	Kanaaf deeme.
But it’s not a hopeless picture.	Garuu suuraa abdii hin qabne miti.
You can only do that so many times.	Yeroo baay'ee qofa akkas gochuu dandeessa.
He knows why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ni beeka.
He was different.	Inni adda ture.
Sometimes good, sometimes not good.	Yeroo tokko tokko gaarii, yeroo tokko tokko gaarii miti.
Right now.	Ammaa ammaa.
There is a medical reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni yaalaa jira.
Everything could go wrong.	Waan hundumaa dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼa.
I can't find anything wrong there.	Achitti waan dogoggora ta'e argachuu hin danda'u.
It's for you.	Siif ta'a.
There is nothing else to say.	Waan biraa jedhu hin jiru.
He obviously knows me well.	Inni akka gaariitti akka na beeku ifaadha.
I think you love your husband.	Abbaa manaa kee waan jaallattu natti fakkaata.
I didn’t know her reason.	Sababa ishee hin beeku ture.
There is nothing in the eyes.	Ija keessa homaa hin jiru.

That will be another book.	Sun kitaaba biraa ta'a.
Everything should be working now.	Wanti hundi amma hojjechaa jiraachuu qaba.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
He didn’t want anything.	Inni homaa hin barbaanne.
He came a little later.	Yeroo xiqqoo booda dhufe.
If you do, you will not exist.	Yoo akkas goote hin jirtu.
It was obviously a joke.	Qoosaa akka ture ifaadha.
She didn’t do that.	Isheen akkas hin goone.
It should help.	Gargaaruu qaba.
Not very good.	Baayyee gaarii miti.
But it didn’t seem to work.	Garuu waan hojjete hin fakkaatu ture.
They will tell you.	Isaan sitti himu.
In here.	As keessa.
It's not about those things.	Waa'ee wantoota sanaa miti.
There was nothing I saw.	Wanti ani arge hin turre.
Take a good look at him.	Akka gaariitti isa ilaalaa.
It doesn’t always work.	Yeroo hunda hin hojjetu.
It’s a disaster.	Balaa dha.
I can't tell you now.	Amma sitti himuu hin danda'u.
All in good time.	Hundi yeroo gaariitti.
But he certainly couldn’t stay.	Garuu turuu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
After your children? 	Ijoollee keessan booda?
I couldn’t find them.	Isaan argachuu hin dandeenye.
No one saw it.	Namni arge hin jiru.
I can go there.	Achi deemuu nan danda'a.
Which never became clear.	Kan gonkumaa ifa hin taane ta’e.
Another one with shortly.	Kan biraa yeroo muraasa booda waliin ta'a.
They know me very well.	Isaan baay'ee na beeku.
No one else is going.	Namni biraa hin deemu.
You’re not waiting for me.	Ati na eegaa hin jirtu.
And .	Fi .
But he did not know them.	Inni garuu isaan hin beeku ture.
But this was different.	Garuu kun adda ture.
It wasn’t him.	Isa hin turre.
He had to say something.	Waan tokko dubbachuu qaba ture.
We are there to work on ourselves.	Of irratti hojjechuuf achi jirra.
In the same situation.	Haala wal fakkaatu keessatti.
He obviously has a bad feeling about this.	Kana irratti miira hamaa akka qabu ifaadha.
Maybe it's something else entirely.	Tarii guutummaatti waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
He knows the way.	Karaa ni beeka.
Not really sure.	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa miti.
I'm sure he has.	Inni akka qabu mirkanaa'adha.
We stayed with her parents for a little while.	Yeroo xiqqoo warra ishee bira turre.
This was not a chance encounter.	Kun wal arguu carraa hin turre.
That was a very good night.	Halkan sun halkan baayyee gaarii ture.
Some people are different.	Namoonni tokko tokko adda.
But one thing was for sure.	Garuu wanti tokko mirkanaa'aa ture.
But then if it were easy, everyone would be doing it.	Garuu sana booda osoo salphaa ta'ee namni hundi hojjechaa ture.
I didn't see how it could be her.	Akkamitti ishee ta'uu akka danda'u hin argine.
I want to go to her.	Gara ishee deemuun barbaada.
It could be a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
One, two, three.	Tokko, lama, sadii.
You just can’t.	Hin dandeessu qofa.
Must	Dirqama
It must be first.	Dura ta'uu qaba.
But most of the time this isn’t the case.	Garuu yeroo baay’ee kun hin ta’u.
I would never say anything like that.	Ani gonkumaa waan akkasii hin jedhu ture.
He seems like a good guy.	Gurbaa gaarii fakkaata.
I know you’re right.	Sirrii akka taate nan beeka.
This is a clear mistake.	Kun dogoggora ifaadha.
The little girl.	Intala xiqqoo.
He couldn't speak to me.	Natti dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
That's where you want to be.	Bakka ati ta'uu barbaaddu kanuma.
It’s just what they have to do.	Waan isaan gochuu qaban qofa.
I think most people can.	Namoonni baay'een ni danda'u jedheen yaada.
Everything seems fine so far.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata.

Fortunately, he didn't know what to do.	Akka carraa ta'ee waan godhu hin beekne.
With the children.	Ijoollee waliin.
I want to know who did it.	Eenyu akka godhe beekuu barbaada.
Look at my eyes.	Ija koo ilaalaa.
He would have loved that.	Silaa sana ni jaallata ture.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
I think you’re really on to something here.	Dhuguma asitti waan tokko irratti waan jirtu natti fakkaata.
That wasn’t entirely true, but it would have been enough.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre, garuu silaa gahaa ture.
A long time passed.	Yeroo dheeraa darbe.
I know everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hundumaa nan beeka.
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
The reason for this is obvious.	Sababni kanaa ifaadha.
This was a rare occasion.	Kun yeroo muraasa ture.
I have no idea what the problem could be.	Rakkoon maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu.
I didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
You don’t want it to look like that.	Akkas akka fakkaatu hin barbaaddu.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
He was obviously none of their business.	Inni dhimma isaanii akka hin turre ifaadha.
He really needs to work on that.	Dhuguma sana irratti hojjechuu qaba.
The problem is ourselves.	Rakkoon jiru of keenya.
It just wasn’t mine.	Kan koo qofa hin turre.
She should be fine.	Isheen gaarii ta'uu qabdi.

They would have helped him.	Silaa isa gargaaru turan.
On your way, boy.	Karaa kee irratti gurbaa.
They had no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban turan.
Which of course it is.	Kan akka ta'e beekamaadha.
I might be one of you, he said.	Ani tarii isin keessaa tokko ta'uu nan danda'a jedhe.
I absolutely do.	Ani guutummaatti nan godha.
A dangerous time.	Yeroo balaa qabu.
Otherwise, not bad.	Yoo kana hin taane, hamaa miti.
It took time.	Yeroo fudhate.
I know that exactly.	Sana sirriitti beeka.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
But it has always been like that.	Yeroo hundumaa garuu akkas ture.
That's not to say things weren't happening.	Kana jechuun wanti ta'aa hin turre jechuu miti.
She was alone in the house with her.	Ishee waliin mana keessa kophaa ishee turte.
There was one problem though.	Rakkoon tokko garuu ture.
Your saying.	Jechuun kee.
You can say it.	Jechuu dandeessa.
This was exactly what he wanted.	Kun sirriitti waan inni barbaade ture.
He told himself it was nonsense.	Waan hin taane jedhee ofitti dubbate.
You’re just wrong.	Ati dogoggora qofa.
Again, she was wrong.	Ammas dogoggora qabdi turte.
Things have never been good.	Wanti gaarii ta'ee hin beeku.
That seemed wrong.	Sun dogoggora fakkaata ture.
No one could go back to it.	Namni itti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
There was no such person.	Namni akkasii hin turre.
We saw her at a party	Affeerraa irratti ishee argine
It was her again.	Ammas ishee ture.

But she had friends.	Garuu hiriyyoota qabdi turte.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
He thinks he shouldn't have come.	Silaa dhufuu hin qabu ture jedhee yaada.
I want the same thing.	Anis kanuma nan barbaada.
This time was different.	Yeroon kun adda ture.
You can help me more.	Caalaatti na gargaaruu dandeessu.
They are at my house with my wife and daughter.	Haadha manaa fi intala koo waliin mana koo jiru.
But the problem was, people were in the way.	Garuu rakkoon ture, namoonni karaa keessa turan.
I know who this is.	Kun eenyu akka ta'e nan beeka.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
Does he really look like that?	Dhuguma inni akkas fakkaataa?
It was a full day at the time.	Yeroo sanatti guyyaa guutuu ture.
I couldn’t find one.	Tokko argachuu hin dandeenye.
We still have it.	Ammas qabna.
No one knew anything.	Namni homaa beeku hin turre.
She just had no idea where it was.	Isheen eessa akka ta'e qofa yaada hin qabdu turte.
That wasn’t us.	Sun nu hin turre.
I like it that way.	Akkas ta'ee natti tola.
I didn’t know the answer.	Deebii isaa hin beeku ture.
Of course, we have no such luck.	Carraa akkasii akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
In this section.	Kutaa kana keessatti.
This is obviously incorrect.	Kun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
It wasn’t like that before.	Kanaan dura akkas hin turre.
I know what you want.	Waan ati barbaaddu nan beeka.
It’s never hers though.	Gonkumaa kan ishee miti garuu.
But that can't be.	Garuu sun ta'uu hin danda'u.
They were waiting for us.	Isaan nu eegaa turan.
A big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa.
But that’s not good enough.	Garuu sun gaarii miti.
You need to know what that is.	Sun maal akka taʼe beekuu qabda.
You shouldn’t have us there.	Achitti nu qabaachuu hin qabdu turte.
Which she was, of course.	Kan isheen turte beekamaadha.
He knew me.	Na beeka ture.
That was always there.	Sun yoomiyyuu ture.
With someone else, none of those things might happen.	Nama biraa wajjin wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
It certainly doesn’t go away completely.	Guutummaatti akka hin deemne beekamaadha.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
A few suggestions.	Yaada muraasa.
That went pretty well, but then, not so well.	Sun baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme, garuu sana booda, akkas gaarii miti.
We don't need any money for this month.	Ji'a kanaaf qarshii tokkollee nu hin barbaachisu.
None of them are there.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
It may mean giving up something.	Waan tokko dhiisuu jechuu taʼuu dandaʼa.
Where you need it there.	Bakka si barbaachisu achitti.
So I was even happier.	Kanaaf caalaatti gammadeera.
We need new ideas.	Yaada haaraa nu barbaachisa.
Most of the time it was just me.	Yeroo baayʼee ana qofa ture.
Everything is perfectly clear.	Wanti hundi guutummaatti ifaadha.
I'm sure there's nothing there.	Achitti wanti tokkollee akka hin jirre mirkanaa'adha.
It wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa hin turre.
It looks pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
Not before, not now.	Duraan miti, ammas miti.
He was much more than that.	Inni kana caalaa baayʼee ture.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
What everyone wants.	Wanti namni hundi barbaadu.
She was a newcomer.	Isheen nama haaraa turte.
You can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
They are making fun of me.	Natti qoosaa jiru.
I'm going to help you.	Si gargaaruuf deema.
It seems pretty simple.	Baayyee salphaa fakkaata.
So he must have been here before.	Kanaaf kanaan dura as ture ta'uu qaba.
He didn't say anything to his parents about that.	Waa'ee sanaa warra isaatiin homaa hin dubbanne.
It wasn't much of an afternoon now.	Amma waaree booda baay'ee hin turre.
It’s better than living.	Jiraachuu irra wayya.
But maybe it's true.	Garuu tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
There could only have been one possibility.	Carraan jiru tokko qofa ta’uu danda’a ture.
He was in there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi keessa ture.
Except, he.	Malee, inni.
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
He still had things to do.	Ammallee wantoota hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
Look at him!	Isa ilaalaa!
She was not a teacher, but a teacher.	Barsiisaa osoo hin taane, barsiisaa turte.
No one asked me any questions.	Namni gaaffii tokkollee na gaafate hin jiru.
We are going through it.	Keessa deemaa jirra.
That might be the worst thing.	Sun tarii waan hundumaa caalaa hamaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I am that person.	Ani nama sana.
If not today, tomorrow soon.	Har'a yoo hin taane boru yeroo dhiyootti.
But no one else was around.	Garuu namni biraa naannoo sana hin turre.
Only a few are interested.	Fedhii kan qaban muraasa qofa.
Things are not like that anymore.	Kana booda wanti akkas miti.
We can’t have one without you.	Si malee tokko qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
He just looked at him.	Isa qofa ilaale.
We were in a very dangerous situation.	Haala baayyee balaa keessa turre.
All the same, they couldn’t.	Hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu, hin dandeenye.
All of you.	Hundi keessan.
It is there, of course.	Achi akka jiru beekamaadha.
It's going to be a good time!.	Yeroo gaarii ta'uuf jira!.
You wouldn't understand about that.	Silaa waa'ee sanaa siif hin galle.
Not even a dog.	Saree illee miti.
You can stay.	Turuu dandeessu.
He was a drinker.	Inni dhugaatii ture.
Nothing so far.	Hanga ammaatti homaa hin jiru.
But time will definitely tell!.	Garuu yeroon himuu hin oolu!.
That’s how it started.	Akkasitti jalqabe.
You just knew it.	Ati qofa beekta turte.
He certainly will be.	Inni akka ta'u beekamaadha.
But tonight he has to do something different.	Halkan kana garuu waan adda ta'e gochuu qaba.
This requires more work than what has happened so far.	Kun waan hanga ammaatti ta'e caalaa hojii barbaada.
Still, it can't be that bad.	Ammas ta'ee hangas hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
As she should be.	Akkuma isheen ta'uu qabdu.
It wasn't just today.	Har'a qofa hin turre.
None were overly excited.	Tokkollee garmalee gammade hin jiru.
I thought he was one.	Inni tokko ta'uu isaa jedheen yaade.
That's what it should be.	Kana ta'uu qaba.
Should last a month if not longer.	Yoo kana caalaa yoo hin taane ji'a tokko turuu qaba.
Nothing really happened.	Dhuguma wanti ta'e hin jiru.
She should know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qabdi.
Still, she didn't know but the boys.	Ammas ta'ee, isheen gurbaa malee hin beektu turte.
That was a very good idea.	Sun yaada baayʼee gaarii ture.
I was just with her, up at his house.	Ani ishee waliin qofa ture, ol mana isaa.
This was no longer the case.	Kana booda kun hin turre.
I was like that.	Ani akka ture.
You have to give me something.	Waan tokko naaf kennuu qabda.
I can't live without it.	Isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
They love their children.	Ijoollee isaanii ni jaallatu.
It rarely happens like this anymore.	Kana booda yeroo muraasaaf akkas ta'a.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee.
I love them so much.	Baay'een isaan jaalladha.
I don't know him well.	Ani sirriitti isa hin beeku.
That had to go.	Sun deemuu qaba ture.
Living with her.	Ishee waliin jiraachuu.
Maybe that's asking too much.	Tarii sun garmalee gaafachuu ta'uu danda'a.
But we can’t have that.	Garuu sana qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
I just looked at it.	Anis qofa ilaale.
A lifetime ahead of them.	Jireenya guutuu isaan dura.
The two are not right.	Lamaan sirrii hin taane.
Tell me what you want me to be.	Maal akkan ta'u barbaaddu natti himi.
Except for her parents.	Warra ishee malee.
No one asked him for anything.	Namni homaa isa gaafate hin jiru.
It does nothing to help.	Gargaaruuf homaa hin godhu.
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo miti.
Something very special.	Waan baayyee adda ta'e.
But I was fine.	Ani garuu gaarii ture.
Still, it wasn't that great with.	Ammas ta'ee waliin hangas guddaa hin turre.
I will do just that.	Anis kanuma qofa nan godha.
I am very good at my job.	Ani hojii koo irratti baayyee ga'umsa qaba.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
This is what should happen.	Kan ta'uu qabu kana.
She had had enough of that.	Sana gahaa ta'ee turte.
It was bad all right.	Hamaa ture hunda sirriitti.
He couldn't have been there.	Silaa achi ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
Maybe, maybe more.	Tarii, tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
It was so obvious.	Akka malee ifa ture.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee waan hojjetu fakkaata.
I can do that better than he can.	Ani isa caalaa sana gochuu nan dandaʼa.
He took a chance.	Carraa fudhate.
But even this is problematic.	Garuu kun illee rakkoo qaba.
It was an easy task.	Hojii salphaa ture.
But most of the time it doesn't happen.	Garuu yeroo baayyee hin ta'u.
They needed a new teacher.	Barsiisaa haaraa isaan barbaachisa ture.
I thought it was a great idea.	Yaada guddaa natti fakkaate.
I went through it, too.	Anis keessa darbe.
Some things we don’t know yet.	Wantoota tokko tokko hanga ammaatti hin beekne.
More, more me.	Caalaa, caalaa ana.
Not sure any of that is true.	Sana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I didn’t really know her at the time.	Yeroo sanatti dhuguma ishee hin beeku ture.
But it wasn’t like that at all.	Garuu tasumaa akkas hin turre.
It couldn't be easier!.	Kana caalaa salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u!.
He arrived late today.	Har'a yeroo booda dhufe.
Things were different here.	Asitti wanti jiru adda ture.
I'm just saying.	Jechuun koo qofa.
That wasn’t even supposed to happen.	Sun illee ta’uu hin qabu ture.
He told her she was no longer there.	Kana booda akka hin jirre itti hime.
I think we should vote on that.	Sana irratti sagalee kennuu qabna jedheen yaada.
It’s still bright outside.	Ammallee ala ifaadha.
Glad to have found you.	Si argachuu isaatti gammadeera.
Now this is the problem.	Amma rakkoon jiru kana.
She was up to doing that.	Isheen akkas gochuuf ol jettee turte.
I’m good, really.	Ani gaarii dha, dhuguma.
But it will be good to go.	Garuu deemuun gaarii ta'a.
It’s not new.	Haaraa miti.
Your name before mine.	Maqaa kee kan koo dura.
You shouldn’t have come here.	Silaa as dhufuu hin qabdu turte.
I had said that, too.	Anis akkas jedheen ture.
We have a lot of work to do.	Hojii baay'ee qabna.
But that was really good for me.	Garuu sun dhuguma naaf gaarii ture.
Just like it was in yesterday.	Akkuma kaleessa keessa ture.
But only later.	Garuu booda qofa.
She didn't know what to say.	Maal akka isheen jedhu hin beekne.
Then great again.	Sana booda ammas guddaa.
He was a guy who made you think.	Gurbaa akka ati yaaddu godhe ture.
But that doesn’t work.	Garuu sun hin hojjetu.
I can't know you can't see it.	Arguu akka hin dandeenye beekuu hin danda'u.
I wondered what they wanted me to look for.	Maal akkan barbaadu barbaadu jedheen yaade.
He didn’t know why he did this to himself.	Maaliif akkas akka of irratti godhe hin beeku ture.
Light.	Ifa.
Nothing about my life seemed real.	Waaʼee jireenya koo wanti dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu ture.
It’s time to do something completely new.	Waan guutummaatti haaraa hojjechuuf yeroon isaa amma.
But she was very different from my mother.	Garuu haadha koo irraa baayyee adda turte.
It just doesn’t look good.	Gaarii hin fakkaatu qofa.
Which is a lot of things.	Kan waan baay'ee.
I really don't know anything about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku.
He was in the wrong, not me.	Inni dogoggora keessa ture malee ana miti.
He just thought it was.	Inni akkas qofa itti fakkaate.
Everyone else is gone except me.	Ana malee kan biraa hundi hin jiru.
It passed quickly and quickly.	Dafee dafee darbe.
She needs more of this in her life.	Jireenya ishee keessatti kana caalaa ishee barbaachisa.
I didn’t know then.	Yeroo sana hin beeku ture.
From and outside of existence itself.	Ofii jiraachuu irraa fi ala.
He wasn't there.	Achi hin turre.
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
This is what she does.	Kan isheen gootu kana.
I can still get it.	Ammas argachuu nan danda'a.
He didn’t want to tell his parents.	Warra isaatti himuu hin barbaanne.
She didn't know what to do with it.	Maal akka itti gootu hin beekne.
We have absolutely no idea where he was that day.	Guyyaa sana eessa akka ture gonkumaa yaada hin qabnu.
Sometimes you have to work at it.	Yeroo tokko tokko irratti hojjechuu qabda.
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
But that would have been a very different book, so who knows.	Garuu sun kitaaba baayyee adda ta'a ture, kanaaf eenyutu beeka.
I couldn’t really see anything.	Dhuguma homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I wanted to tell you something.	Waan tokko sitti himuu barbaade.
Be your great you can you.	Ta'uu kee guddaa ati dandeessa si.
Such a great sound.	Sagalee guddaa akkasii.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
Almost two years ago.	Waggaa lama dura jechuun ni danda'ama.
I was the only one who could help me.	Kan na gargaaruu danda'u ana qofa ture.
But what he knew now was enough.	Garuu wanti inni amma beeku gahaa ture.
If you don’t want to, you don’t need to respond.	Yoo hin barbaaddu deebii kennuu hin barbaachisu.
Now, things would be different.	Amma, wanti jiru adda ta'a ture.
No one else is there.	Namni biraa achi hin jiru.
Clearly, what he said was not true.	Wanti inni dubbate dhugaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
But I couldn’t help myself.	Garuu of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
It will be good for you.	Siif gaarii ta'a.
But she didn't know.	Garuu hin beektu turte.
I have two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama qaba.
They have one daughter.	Intala tokko qabu.
Other than that, it is nothing.	Kana malee homaa miti.
He is in you.	Inni si keessa jira.
Maybe you did.	Tarii ati goote ta'a.
You can’t help everyone.	Nama hunda gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
He is only three months old.	Umuriin isaa ji'a sadii qofa.
During this work.	Yeroo hojii kana.
How much time is it?	Yeroon isaa meeqa?
The one that used to be.	Kan duraan ture.
I love so many things.	Waan baay'een jaalladha.
It was without any desire to own a home.	Fedhii mana qabaachuu tokko malee ture.
He didn't seem to mind it.	Inni waan gaarii itti fakkaate hin fakkaatu ture.
Nothing seemed to have happened.	Wanti ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
But it was easy.	Garuu salphaa ture.
I couldn't say anything else.	Waan biraa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
But there was a problem.	Garuu rakkoon ture.
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
It’s not your problem.	Rakkoo keessan miti.
I really didn't want to talk about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
That's how it goes.	Akkasitti deema.
I wanted to do this exactly.	Kana sirriitti gochuu barbaade.
Can you give me a hand with this?	Kanaan harka naaf kennuu dandeessaa?
On this issue.	Dhimma kana irratti.
In this case it was a good thing.	Haala kana keessatti waan gaarii ture.
You weren't supposed to be like that.	Akkas ta'uu qabdu hin turre.
Maybe it would have to.	Tarii dirqama ta'a ture.
Do you think we need to go there?	Achi deemuun nu barbaachisa jettanii yaaddu?
They have such a great sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa guddaa akkasii qabu.
But this one knows how to commit to it.	Inni kun garuu akkamitti akka itti of kennuu danda'u beeka.
I don’t have a father.	Ani abbaa hin qabu.
He found himself doing more.	Caalaatti hojjechaa of argate.
Maybe it's probably.	Tarii ta'uu hin oolu.
He may not have time to go.	Yeroo deemu hin qabu ta'a.
You just need to do it.	Hojjechuu qofa si barbaachisa.
He never did it.	Gonkumaa hin goone.
What are you doing tonight?	Halkan kana maal hojjechaa jirta?
Only then, though.	Sana booda qofa garuu.
He doesn't have any.	Inni tokkollee hin qabu.
He didn't have long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin qabu ture.
But it will happen.	Garuu ni ta'a.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
Now it seems to be working.	Amma waan hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
It was a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee ture.
More than last year.	Waggaa darbe caalaa.
No one says that.	Namni akkas jedhu hin jiru.
Now he lives in them.	Amma isaan keessa jiraata.
I don't want that.	Ani akkas hin barbaadu.
Not yet, it's been a week.	Ammallee miti torban tokko ta'a.
I'll go the other way.	Karaa biraa nan deema.
They like to have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu ni jaallatu.
They were often wrong.	Yeroo baayyee dogoggora turan.
I like it a little bit.	Xiqqoo natti tola.
It wasn’t completely.	Guutummaatti hin turre.
He thinks so.	Akkas jedhee yaada.
I want to make my own.	Kan koo hojjechuu barbaada.
It’s no different than any other day.	Guyyaa biraa irraa adda miti.
That was them.	Sun isaan turan.
I have been waiting for it to come.	Akka dhufu eegaa tureera.
Everything seemed more real.	Wanti hundi dhugaa caalaa fakkaata ture.
Such a good book.	Kitaaba gaarii akkasii.
So he didn’t do it.	Kanaaf hin goone.
One, two, three.	Tokko, lama, sadii.
I want that for you.	Sana siif barbaada.
This cannot be true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
We had no idea what to do with it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti maal akka itti goonu yaada hin qabnu turre.
I know what this sounds like, though.	Kun maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka, garuu.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Not too big of a deal.	Baayyee guddaa miti.
I don't know anything else.	Ani waan biraa hin beeku.
They were doing better.	Isaan kana caalaa hojjechaa turan.
Which tells me two things.	Kan waan lama natti himu.
But it is not like that at all.	Garuu tasumaa akkas miti.
I know how to do that.	Akkamitti akkan sana godhu nan beeka.
But maybe not.	Garuu tarii hin ta'u.
But that just wasn’t him.	Garuu sun isa hin turre qofa.
It’s a great thing.	Waan guddaa dha.
I don’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku.
He had had enough now.	Inni amma gahaa ta'ee ture.
People were walking away.	Namoonni deemaa turan.
It's going on a lot.	Baayyee deemaa jira.
But it wasn’t in mine.	Garuu kan koo keessa hin turre.
This may not be the case.	Kun ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
But I don’t know how it works.	Garuu akkamitti akka hojjetu hin beeku.
None of this was wrong.	Kun tokkollee dogoggora hin turre.
That's the kind of guy he is.	Gurbaa inni akkas ta'e.
I don’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
Look at what we have.	Mee waan qabnu ilaalaa.
You have everything you have.	Waan qabdu hunda qabda.
It was a great day.	Guyyaa guddaa ture.
I don't want this.	Ani kana hin barbaadu.
It’s not a big deal though.	Waan guddaa miti garuu.
But two things.	Garuu waan lama.
I knew that was you.	Sun si ta'uu kee nan beeka ture.
It doesn’t mean you don’t already.	Duraan hin gootu jechuu miti.
I think that’s the reason he gave.	Sababni inni kenne kanuma natti fakkaata.
Then he went away.	Sana booda ni deeme.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
It seems more like.	Caalaatti fakkaata.
Good luck tomorrow.	Boru carraa gaarii.
None of them were now.	Isaan keessaa amma tokkollee hin turre.
You think you know what you want.	Waan barbaaddu waan beektu sitti fakkaata.
But that didn’t work.	Garuu sun hin hojjenne.
I know what it is, but that doesn't matter.	Maal akka ta'e nan beeka, garuu sun homaa hin qabu.
It’s very dangerous here.	Asitti balaa guddaa qaba.
I knew what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka ture.
These people are very wrong.	Namoonni kun baay'ee dogoggora.
I didn’t know anything.	Ani homaa hin beeku ture.
Then I saw another one.	Sana booda kan biraa arge.
In the house.	Mana keessa.
That can't be right.	Sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
He doesn't need to.	Inni hin barbaachisu.
I want to say a couple of things.	Waan lama sadii jechuu barbaada.
I really wanted it.	Ani baay'een barbaade.
I just don't know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e qofa hin beeku.
He wasn’t a little dog.	Inni saree xiqqoo hin turre.
This worked very well for me.	Kun baayyee gaarii naaf hojjete.
He has.	Inni qaba.
Going at night?	Halkan deemuu?
I didn't think so.	Akkas jedhee hin yaadne.
That's not going to be easy.	Sun salphaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
They are being themselves, but more than that.	Of ta'aa jiru, garuu kana caalaa.
My favorite part.	Kutaa ani jaalladhu.
Maybe in that bar.	Tarii mana dhugaatii sana keessa ta'a.
He saw something.	Waan tokko arge.
Things were very different now.	Amma wanti jiru baayʼee adda ture.
We have to go.	Deemu qabna.
But this was not the only accident.	Garuu balaa kana qofa hin turre.
Just plain wrong.	Dogoggora ifa ta'e qofa.
You have to work your way through.	Karaa kee hojjechuu qabda.
But that doesn’t seem to help.	Garuu sun waan gargaaru hin fakkaatu.
I didn't tell anyone about it.	Waa'ee kanaa namatti hin himne.
We need to find them.	Isaan argachuu qabna.
He could never tell her that.	Inni gonkumaa akkas itti himuu hin dandeenye.
Only two out of three.	Sadii keessaa lama qofa.
That was pretty bad, what happened.	Sun baayyee hamaa ture, maaltu ta'e.
But I didn’t want any of them.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
I don't think so.	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
It seems to help.	Kan gargaaru fakkaata.
I wanted to make it very clear.	Baay'ee ifa gochuu barbaade.
Then everyone left.	Sana booda namni hundi ni deeme.
but really, it was a good day.	garuu dhuguma, guyyaa gaarii ture.
He didn't want to go.	Deemu hin barbaanne.
This could be my chance.	Kun carraa koo ta’uu danda’a.
No one knows.	Namni beeku hin jiru.
But that should never happen.	Garuu sun gonkumaa ta'uu hin qabu.
But he seems to like it.	Garuu waan jaallatu fakkaata.
I'm there for you.	Ani achi jira.
He certainly doesn’t know me.	Inni akka na hin beekne beekamaadha.
What does it look like?	Maal fakkaata?
It can be a very long night.	Halkan baayyee dheeraa ta'uu danda'a.
They’re pretty loud.	Isaan baay’ee sagalee guddaa qabu.
Not when she was watching them from a house.	Yeroo mana tokko keessaa isaan ilaalaa turte miti.
They were often like that.	Yeroo baayyee akkas turan.
I didn’t want any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
But he wanted to.	Garuu barbaade.
I didn’t quite know how it worked.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu sirriitti hin beeku ture.
Maybe she'll never be able to have one of her own.	Tarii kan ishee tokko qabaachuu gonkumaa hin dandeessu ta'a.
Obviously, this goes both ways.	Kun karaa lamaan akka deemu beekamaadha.
I didn’t think you were.	Ati natti hin fakkaatu ture.
Under the circumstances it was a very unlikely possibility.	Haala jiru keessatti waan ta'uu danda'u baay'ee hin oolle ture.
I can't stay any longer.	Kana booda turuu hin danda'u.
I still love you.	Ammallee si jaalladha.
You have nothing but him.	Isa malee homaa hin qabdu.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
It was something that happened later.	Waan booda ta'ee ture.
It will not be an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin ta'u.
He doesn’t look good.	Inni gaarii hin fakkaatu.
All you have to do is ask me.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu na gaafachuu qofa.
I couldn't believe it.	Amanuu hin dandeenye.
We are with you in this work.	Hojii kana keessatti isin waliin jirra.
Right now.	Ammaa ammaa.
Maybe she was there too.	Tarii isheen illee achi turte ta'a.
It was an opportunity to do that.	Sana gochuuf carraa ture.
But it never happened.	Garuu gonkumaa hin taane.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
That may not be enough.	Sun gahaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
She wasn’t alone, but she was lonely.	Kophaa ishee hin turre, garuu kophaa ishee turte.
But they are different.	Garuu isaan adda.
She wasn’t looking for her father at all.	Tasumaa abbaa ishee barbaadaa hin turre.
We need to give it time.	Yeroo kennuu qabna.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
There is no such thing here, of course.	Asitti wanti akkasii hin jiru, beekamaadha.
I would have gone.	Silaa nan deema ture.
This was our home.	Kun mana keenya ture.
I'm looking for three episodes.	Ani kutaa sadii barbaadaa jira.
But she should have known better.	Garuu silaa caalaatti beekuu qabdi turte.
It won't happen anymore.	Kana booda hin ta'u.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
Too many missed opportunities.	Carraa baay'ee darbe.
Sometimes you just can’t help them.	Yeroo tokko tokko isaan gargaaruu qofa hin dandeessu.
Maybe he'll get lucky.	Tarii carraa argachuu danda'a.
I don't know why this happens.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u hin beeku.
I really didn't know why any of it.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e tokkollee hin beekne.
You have three days.	Guyyaa sadii qabda.
He took his time.	Yeroo isaa fudhate.
They can do even better for you.	Isaan kana caalaa siif hojjechuu dandaʼu.
There is nothing there.	Achitti homaa hin jiru.
He took two.	Lama fudhate.
A lot of those about.	Baay'ee warra waa'ee.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
He had their promise.	Waadaa isaanii qaba ture.
But it really didn’t happen.	Garuu dhuguma hin taane.
Unless it's bad.	Yoo hamaa ta'e malee.
What was it, he wondered.	Maal ture jedhee yaade.
And it didn’t happen again.	Ammas hin taane.
I think you might know someone.	Natti fakkaata ati nama beeku ta'a.
I didn’t think it was a big deal.	Waan guddaa natti hin fakkaatu ture.
She had no children.	Ijoollee hin qabdu turte.
But of course nothing was ever really new.	Garuu beekamaadha wanti dhuguma haaraa ta'ee hin beeku.
This was some time ago.	Kun yeroo muraasa dura ture.
And now the right time came.	Ammas yeroon sirrii ta'e dhufe.
There is no answer.	Deebii hin qabu.
But none of them are around.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee naannoo hin jiru.
They are waiting for you.	Isaan si eegaa jiru.
We understood.	Nuti hubanne.
He has this.	Inni kana qaba.
We had a very long way to go.	Karaa baayyee dheeraa deemuu qabna turre.
Still, not everything is going.	Ammas wanti hundi hin deemu.
But it goes further than that.	Garuu kana caalaa deema.
I don't know what else.	Kan biraa maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
This was my favorite episode of the season so far.	Kun kutaa bara kanaa hanga ammaatti baay'ee jaalladhu ture.
Then, it becomes an idea.	Sana booda, yaada ta’a.
He couldn't believe what he had just done.	Waan amma hojjete amanuu hin dandeenye.
She had to do it now.	Amma gochuu qabdi turte.
Now what? 	Amma maal?
Maybe you are.	Tarii ati jirtu.
This is certainly not the case for everyone.	Kun nama hunda akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I say go for it.	Ani itti deemaa jedha.
Maybe they don't have it.	Tarii hin qaban ta'a.
Get me back.	Na deebi'i.
I wanted much, much more.	Kana caalaa baayʼee baayʼee barbaade.
A year ago.	Waggaa tokko dura.
I can't tell him.	Ani itti himuu hin danda'u.
I'm happy for him.	Isaaf gammadeera.
This is not easy.	Kun salphaa miti.
I'm happy today.	Har'a gammadeera.
We will certainly do this.	Kana gochuun keenya hin oolu.
I was the one she had something in common with.	Ani isa isheen waan wal fakkaatu qabu ture.
Tell me, tell me.	Natti himi, natti himi.
I still don’t think it exists.	Ammallee waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
Today, one in three works part-time.	Har’a sadii keessaa tokko yeroo muraasaaf hojjeta.
So we don't do anything.	Kanaaf homaa hin goonu.
They love him.	Isa ni jaallatu.
It’s somewhere else.	Bakka biraa jira.
Now they tell me.	Amma natti himu.
Still the same guy.	Ammallee gurbaa sana.
He wasn’t going to do that.	Kana gochuuf hin turre.
He looked at his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa ilaale.
The timing couldn't be better.	Yeroon kun kana caalaa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
But now everything was different.	Amma garuu wanti hundi adda ture.
You still have issues.	Ammallee dhimma qabda.
He really wouldn’t.	Dhuguma hin godhu ture.
Nothing happened anymore.	Kana booda homaa hin taane.
He was, more than anything, funny.	Inni, waan hundumaa caalaa, qoosaa ture.
He may not have much time.	Yeroo baayʼee qabaachuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
But maybe it won't.	Tarii garuu hin ta'u.
Nothing and everything.	Homaa fi waan hundumaa.
They are doing well.	Gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
But look at this.	Garuu kana ilaalaa.
But, one must be what really happened.	Garuu, namni tokko waan dhuguma ta’e ta’uu qaba.
Not with me.	Ana waliin miti.
So that’s what we did.	Kanaaf nuti kanuma goone.
He has no clear interest.	Fedhii ifa ta'e hin qabu.
I think she was.	Isheen akka turte natti fakkaata.
He went on it.	Irratti deeme.
One could never go back.	Namni tokko gonkumaa duubatti deebi’uu hin danda’u ture.
They are usually on their hands.	Yeroo baay'ee harka isaanii irra jiru.
But he wasn’t looking for money.	Garuu maallaqa barbaadaa hin turre.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I know it wasn’t.	Akka hin turre nan beeka.
Look for her.	Ishee barbaadaa.
I have no idea how to do that.	Akkamitti akkan sana godhu yaada hin qabu.
We have a whole day.	Guyyaa guutuu qabna.
If that’s not enough for you, I’m sorry.	Yoo sun siif gahaa hin taane dhiifama.
A book, maybe.	Kitaaba tokko, tarii.
This is a popular dish.	Kun nyaata beekamaadha.
That was true.	Sun dhugaa ture.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
She was not her daughter.	Isheen intala ishee hin turre.
He said everything was fine then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti hundi gaarii dha jedhe.
But he was still our father.	Garuu ammallee abbaa keenya ture.
People weren’t her thing.	Namoonni waan ishee hin turre.
That was the case with me.	Ana waliin akkas ture.
He has one.	Tokko qaba.
You don't want to go.	Deemu hin barbaaddu.
He did not do it very often.	Yeroo baayʼee hin goone.
There must be something we can do.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu jiraachuu qaba.
We couldn’t have done it.	Silaa gochuu hin dandeenyu ture.
He told him about his work.	Waa'ee hojii isaa itti hime.
It didn’t happen that way.	Akkasitti hin taane.
He is one of them.	Inni tokko.
. . . .	.
But it doesn't happen to me.	Garuu natti hin ta'u.
He should have gone.	Silaa deemuu qaba ture.
Then she hesitated.	Sana booda duubatti jette.
There is no such problem.	Rakkoon akkasii hin jiru.
You have to meet her.	Ishee waliin wal arguu qabda.
I don't want to say anything.	Ani homaa jechuu hin barbaadu.
How we should live.	Akkamitti jiraachuu qabna.
They were so lucky.	Akkas carraa qaban turan.
I was a human being.	Ani nama ture.
People are talking about.	Namoonni waa'ee.
Maybe you can make him like it more.	Tarii caalaatti akka isa jaallatu gochuu dandeessa.
He needs to know you can do that.	Ati akkas gochuu akka dandeessu beekuu qaba.
And I was, too.	Anis ture.
Not too well done.	Garmalee gaarii hin taane.
I shouldn't go back!.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu!.
I may meet more.	Kana caalaa wal arguu danda'a.
What did he say now?	Maal jedhe amma?
You don’t do it like that.	Akkasitti hin gootu.
That was a good duty.	Sun dirqama gaarii ture.
I know this.	Kana nan beeka.
The timing isn’t right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii miti.
It took up a lot of his time.	Yeroo isaa baay'ee fudhate.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Tarii har'a mana turuu qabdu ta'a.
If there isn't, nothing happened.	Yoo hin jiru ta'e wanti ta'e hin jiru.
You could have, but you didn’t.	Ni dandeessa turte, garuu hin goone.
I am important.	Ani barbaachisaa dha.
That’s got to be good.	Sun gaarii ta’uu qaba ture.
Not on the shoes.	Kophee irratti miti.
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
That seemed easy enough.	Sun salphaa gahaa fakkaata ture.
Not that they still look human.	Ammallee nama fakkaatu jechuu miti.
He didn't want to tell.	Himuu hin barbaanne.
It’s a bit dangerous.	Xiqqoo balaa qaba.
I know her, I know her.	Ani ishee beeka.
It couldn't have been.	Ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
But, this was not enough.	Garuu, kun gahaa hin turre.
In the morning he found his mother watching him.	Ganama haadha isaa isa ilaalaa jirtu argate.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	As irraa eessa akkan deemu qofa hin beeku.
He said he wanted to go back.	Deebi'uu barbaada jedhe.
But he didn’t have much to do at the time.	Garuu yeroo sanatti waan guddaa hojjechuu hin qabu ture.
She didn’t realize her mistake.	Dogoggora ishee hin hubanne.
The two can work well together.	Lamaan isaanii akka gaariitti waliin hojjechuu danda’u.
A lot of issues.	Dhimma baay’ee.
It would be much easier.	Silaa baayyee salphaa ta'a.
She must have it.	Isheen qabaachuu qabdi.
The right food, though.	Nyaata sirrii taʼe garuu.
Bad light.	Ifa hamaa.
We were right to do so.	Akkas gochuun keenya sirrii turre.
But that wasn’t right.	Garuu sun sirrii hin turre.
What this time is.	Yeroon kun maal akka ta'e.
You have to meet him.	Isa waliin wal arguu qabda.
No one should know.	Namni beekuu hin qabu.
It seems, though.	Fakkaata garuu.
Mostly it is like that.	Irra caalaa akkas ta'a.
That's never happened before.	Sun kanaan dura ta'ee hin beeku.
He was a man	Nama ture .
I really think this works.	Dhuguma kun waan hojjetu natti fakkaata.
We will have to go from here.	As irraa deemuun dirqama ta'a.
But there is no time now.	Garuu amma yeroon hin jiru.
He knew that voice well.	Sagalee sana sirriitti beeka ture.
Then he spoke again.	Sana booda ammas dubbate.
Still not so good.	Ammas akkas gaarii miti.
He lived alone.	Kophaa isaa jiraata ture.
I want to go somewhere.	Bakka deemuun barbaada.
You’re not the only one.	Si qofa miti.
But not both of them.	Garuu lamaan isaanii miti.
I didn’t say anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa hin dubbanne.
It was true, though.	Dhugaa ture garuu.
It’s not just that they say it.	Jechuu isaanii qofa miti.
See how that works long term.	Sun yeroo dheeraa akkamitti akka hojjetu ilaalaa.
Thought this was a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii akka ta'e yaade.
It wasn’t bad enough.	Hamaa gahaa hin turre.
They don’t care.	Isaan dhimma hin qaban.
I'm not the only one who can do that.	Kan akkas gochuu danda'u ana qofa miti.
But this is not necessarily the case.	Garuu kun dirqama miti.
But I didn’t know he was gone.	Garuu akka inni deeme hin beeku ture.
People will know.	Namoonni ni beeku.
Wait a moment though.	Yeroo muraasaaf eegaa garuu.
They always went together.	Yeroo hundumaa wal waliin deemu turan.
It may be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
They would have been home.	Silaa mana ta'u turan.
I don’t think anyone did.	Namni tokkollee waan godhe natti hin fakkaatu.
We mean it.	Jechuun keenya.
So who knows.	Kanaaf eenyutu beeka.
He needs someone.	Nama barbaada.
But that doesn’t make it a right or wrong opinion.	Garuu sun yaada sirrii fi dogoggora hin godhu.
But it is possible.	Garuu ni danda'ama.
She definitely wasn’t.	Isheen akka hin taane hin oolu.
But this was good enough for him.	Garuu kun isaaf gaarii ture.
If you could have someone you then.	Osoo nama qabaachuu dandeessa ati yeroo sana.
I know that's important to you.	Sun siif barbaachisaa akka ta'e nan beeka.
She had in the past.	Yeroo darbe qabdi turte.
I thought you were.	Ati natti fakkaate.
He had a father.	Abbaa qaba ture.
They certainly aren’t.	Isaan akka hin taane beekamaadha.
This was their way.	Kun karaa isaanii ture.
He seems to have understood.	Inni waan hubate fakkaata.
Then I saw him.	Sana booda isa arge.
I know it was you.	Si akka turte nan beeka.
I don’t want to give it hope.	Abdii itti kennuu hin barbaadu.
What you need to do is obvious.	Waan gochuu qabdu ifaadha.
Can you see it?	Arguu dandeessaa?
No mistake here.	Asitti dogoggora hin qabu.
Now that wasn’t so bad, was it? 	Amma sun akkas hamaa hin turre mitii?
But it's a good thing.	Garuu waan gaarii.
It worked out.	Ni hojjete.
It works there.	Achitti hojjeta.
No one has an answer.	Namni deebii qabu hin jiru.
That was supposed to happen.	Sun ta’uu qaba ture.
They look pretty good.	Akka gaariitti fakkaatu.
There was no one there.	Namni achi jiru hin turre.
I didn't tell him anything.	Homaa itti hin himne.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
We were doing great.	Guddaa hojjechaa turre.
But maybe we don’t.	Garuu tarii hin qabnu.
Most of the time, though, it doesn't work.	Yeroo baayyee garuu hin hojjetu.
I could do all of that.	Kana hunda gochuu nan dandaʼa ture.
Just like we do now.	Akkuma amma goonu.
I don't think she likes it very much.	Baay'ee waan jaallattu natti hin fakkaatu.
Come back soon.	Dafee deebi'i.
He seemed to like it.	Inni waan jaallatu fakkaata ture.
He looked at it again.	Ammas ilaale.
Very good indeed.	Baayyee gaarii dha dhuguma.
Where he wants to go.	Bakka inni deemuu barbaadu.
No one likes him.	Namni isa jaallatu hin jiru.
It may not be so.	Akkasitti ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I was very excited.	Ani baay'een gammade.
There will be another one.	Kan biraa ni jiraata.
Having a sense of hope.	Miira abdii qabaachuu.
It wasn’t even really my parents.	Dhuguma warra koo illee hin turre.
Great stuff, even.	Waan guddaa, illee.
But that's not really much.	Garuu sun dhuguma waan baay'ee miti.
Which is often true.	Kan yeroo baay’ee dhugaa ta’e.
It didn’t even need to be said.	Jechuun illee hin barbaachifne.
You have to know that kind of stuff.	Waan akkasii beekuu qabda.
She had many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qabdi turte.
I want it to be hers.	Kan ishee akka ta'u nan barbaada.
Tonight was the night.	Halkan kana halkan ture.
It was light enough.	Ifa gahaa ture.
Wait, that’s just two.	Eegaa, sun lama qofa.
You know what is right and what is wrong.	Waan sirrii fi dogoggora ta'e ni beekta.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
I shouldn’t be here at all.	Ani tasumaa as jiraachuu hin qabu.
He just had it in there.	Achi keessa qofa qaba ture.
They should live a good life.	Jireenya gaarii jiraachuu qabu.
It would have been easier.	Silaa salphaa ta'a.
But he knew a lot.	Garuu waan baay'ee beeka ture.
Not telling us anything.	Homaa nutti himuu miti.
Someone would go.	Namni tokko ni deema ture.
It seemed.	Fakkaate.
No need to comment.	Yaada kennuu hin barbaachisu.
It happens, it's there.	Ni ta'a, achi jira.
Not great, not even good.	Guddaa miti, gaarii illee miti.
But they didn’t have enough money then.	Garuu yeroo sana qarshii gahaa hin qaban turan.
But that's not going to happen.	Garuu sun ta'uuf hin deemu.
Ideally on the main floor.	Yoo gaarii ta'e kutaa guddaa irratti.
This is not at any time in the present case.	Kun dhimma amma jiru keessatti yeroo tokkollee miti.
She said it was very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola jette.
It's probably nothing.	Homaa ta'uu hin oolu.
So he had to know.	Kanaaf beekuu qaba ture.
You know how to do it now.	Akkamitti akka gootu amma beekta.
I couldn't do it.	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye.
She was in a good mood all morning.	Ganama guutuu miira gaarii keessa turte.
It’s a simple thing.	Waan salphaa.
We are just husband and wife.	Nuti abbaa manaa fi haadha manaa qofa.
Two cars we.	Konkolaataa lama nuti.
I don't know exactly what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti hin beeku.
No one saw anything.	Namni homaa arge hin jiru.
I don't want to talk anymore.	Kana booda dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
One in the morning, one in the afternoon.	Tokko ganama, tokko waaree booda.
He realized his mistake.	Dogoggora isaa hubate.
People didn’t understand her.	Namoonni ishee hin hubanne.
It works very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
But there was a problem.	Garuu rakkoon ture.
I was very pleased with this.	Kana baay'een gammade.
But you two must forgive me now.	Garuu isin lamaan amma dhiifama naaf gochuu qabdu.
It was so true.	Akkas dhugaa ture.
It's not too bad.	Baay'ee hamaa miti.
Two would be fine, but one would be better.	Lama gaarii ta'a, tokko garuu ni wayya.
Now you are somewhere else.	Amma bakka biraa jirta.
This is the issue.	Dhimma kana.
Perhaps they still do.	Tarii amma iyyuu ni godhu taʼa.
So I was very happy.	Kanaaf baay'een gammade.
I want to know what she said.	Waan isheen jette beekuu barbaada.
This may not be necessary in some cases.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko barbaachisaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
You don’t want ideas.	Yaada hin barbaaddu.
They love it here.	Asitti ni jaallatu.
Now we are in a different situation.	Amma haala adda ta'e keessa jirra.
Maybe there really was something here.	Tarii dhuguma asitti wanti tokko jira ture ta'a.
But that’s not a problem.	Garuu sun rakkoo miti.
Again, they were obviously right.	Ammas sirrii akka turan ifaadha.
They are my friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota kooti.
I knew that couldn't happen.	Wanti akkasii ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture.
It didn't work.	Hin hojjenne.
All was the same as always.	Hundi akkuma yeroo hundumaa ture.
He wasn’t there now.	Inni amma hin jiru ture.
I told him everything.	Waan hundumaa itti hime.
Very good indeed.	Baayyee gaarii dha dhuguma.
I was here a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura as ture.
No question about that.	Waa'ee sanaa gaaffii hin qabu.
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
I can't do it.	Ani gochuu hin danda'u.
He certainly didn’t see anyone.	Nama tokkollee akka hin argine beekamaadha.
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
It is not like that at all.	Tasumaa akkas miti.
Other than that, it is nothing.	Kana malee homaa miti.
It was a little big.	Xiqqoo guddaa ture.
He has two.	Lama qaba.
But they are out there.	Garuu isaan ala jiru.
Not so this time.	Yeroo kana akkas miti.
Not much he wants here.	Waan inni asitti barbaadu baay'ee miti.
I went up to him.	Anis gara isaatti ol ba'e.
There was really nothing anyone could do for him.	Dhuguma wanti namni tokko isaaf gochuu danda'u hin turre.
But it was there.	Garuu achi ture.
But not like you.	Garuu akka kee miti.
I want to know more about it.	Waa'ee kanaa caalaatti beekuu barbaada.
That was bad enough.	Sun hamaa gahaa ture.
I think it's going to be a very good thing.	Waan baayyee gaarii ta'uuf deema jedheen yaada.
It's not going to be forgiven.	Dhiifama hin ta'u.
So .	Kanaaf .
I would like to do the same.	Anis akkas gochuu nan barbaada.
In their cars.	Konkolaataa isaanii keessatti.
I need to know everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu na barbaachisa.
That was a really good thing.	Sun dhuguma waan gaarii ture.
He’s out there.	Inni ala jira.
I am watching them closely.	Ani sirriitti isaan ilaalaa jira.
We should have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu qabna turre.
That's probably true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu hin oolu.
What happened happened.	Wanti ta'e ta'e.
Three hours later.	Sa'aatii sadii booda.
She was a great help.	Gargaarsa guddaa turte.
I mean, good enough.	Gaarii gahaa jechuu kooti.
I had no idea what to say.	Waan jedhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Not much, of course.	Baay’ee miti, beekamaadha.
People want to help you.	Namoonni si gargaaruu barbaadu.
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
But certainly not more.	Garuu kana caalaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He knew something, but she didn't quite know what.	Inni waan tokko beeka ture, isheen garuu maal akka ta'e sirriitti hin beektu turte.
Now, that was lucky.	Amma, sun carraa ture.
But we are there.	Garuu ni jirra.
Why are you here?	Maaliif as jirta?
I'm sure this seems like a great opportunity for him.	Kun carraa guddaa akka isaaf fakkaatu mirkanaa'adha.
There was a great deal to be said about it.	Waa’ee kanaa waan guddaa jechuun ni danda’ama ture.
No reason, but it happened.	Sababa hin qabu garuu ta'e.
Lots of stuff like that.	Waan akkasii baay'ee.
They are good friends.	Hiriyyoota gaarii dha.
You don't mean that.	Akkas jechuu kee miti.
I didn’t think about it.	Hin yaadne.
I like everything in its place.	Waan hundumaa bakka isaa jiru natti tola.
Now you know.	Amma beekta.
They work for us.	Isaan nuuf hojjetu.
It seems that this is no longer the case.	Kana booda waan kana hin taane fakkaata.
It was quick.	Dafee ture.
Not right now, of course.	Yeroo ammaa miti, beekamaadha.
There was none of that here.	Asitti wanti sun tokkollee hin turre.
I can't stay here any longer.	Kana booda as turuu hin danda'u.
Only I can do this.	Kana gochuu kan danda'u ana qofa.
Everything is very different now.	Amma wanti hundi baayyee adda.
I couldn’t see the bigger picture.	Suuraa guddaa sana arguu hin dandeenye.
He told me the boy's name.	Maqaa gurbaa natti hime.
A year ago, that would not have been the case.	Waggaa tokko dura silaa akkas hin ta'u ture.
They have no idea what is good or bad.	Waan gaarii fi hin taane yaada hin qaban.
If he did that, it worked.	Yoo akkas godhe ni hojjete.
Please love her.	Mee ishee jaalladhu.
A lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee.
He didn't say anything about how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e homaa hin dubbanne.
It shouldn't be like that, but it should be.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu, garuu akkas ta'uu qaba.
This can be a broad thing.	Kun waan bal’aa ta’uu danda’a.
There is no one.	Namni tokkollee hin jiru.
But it is never like that.	Garuu gonkumaa akkas miti.
But he was different.	Inni garuu adda ture.
But you have to go.	Garuu deemuu qabda.
People who were around at the time.	Namoota yeroo sanatti naannoo sana turan.
I know we will.	Akka goonu nan beeka.
Everything is very different there now.	Amma achitti wanti hundi baayyee adda.
He's not what's important here.	Inni waan asitti barbaachisaa ta'e miti.
Then he came again.	Sana booda ammas dhufe.
It's been two months now.	Amma ji'a lama.
You knew him.	Isa beekta turte.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Tarii isa hin turre ta'a.
If he was around long enough.	Yoo yeroo dheeraa gahaa naannoo sana ture.
But it was.	Garuu ni ture.
You know, if they’re in the mood.	Beektaa, yoo miira keessa jiru.
I was extremely happy.	Garmalee gammadeera.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Sana keessaa wanti dogoggora ta'e hin jiru.
You have to give it something to do in that situation.	Haala sana keessatti waan hojjetu itti kennuu qabda.
I couldn’t say their names.	Maqaa isaanii dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
It could have been at night.	Halkan ta'uu danda'a ture.
It wasn’t a catch.	Qabduu hin turre.
Perhaps more so.	Tarii kana caalaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I want to tell about it.	Waa'ee isaa himuu barbaada.
This was my only chance.	Carraa koo kana qofa ture.
He was completely alone.	Inni guutummaatti kophaa isaa ture.
It was her way of life.	Haala jireenya ishee ture.
That was really great.	Sun dhuguma waan guddaa ture.
That’s the only reason she’s here.	Sababni isheen as jirtu kana qofa.
I didn’t do anything to them.	Ani homaa isaan hin goone.
That you never do.	Akka ati gonkumaa hin goone.
I didn’t have that last year.	Bara darbe sana hin qabu ture.
Just get it from them.	Isaan irraa argachuu qofa.
I told her to love herself.	Of jaalladhu jedheen ture.
Nothing else about them was on.	Wanti biraa waa'ee isaanii ta'e irra hin turre.
Not now he's in there.	Amma miti inni achi keessa jira.
It's not that he can't.	Hin danda'u miti.
It is not true right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana dhugaa miti.
Should be good, right?.	Gaarii ta'uu qaba mitiiree?.
I think this is a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii natti fakkaata.
Not a good idea.	Yaada gaarii miti.
It was something he did his whole life.	Waan jireenya isaa guutuu hojjete ture.
He arrived an hour ago.	Sa'aatii tokko dura dhufe.
It just doesn’t seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu qofa.
I can't help him.	Isa gargaaruu hin danda'u.
They are all doing well.	Hundi isaanii akka gaariitti hojjechaa jiru.
He wouldn’t go in two weeks.	Torban lama booda hin deemu ture.
I don’t have a dog.	Saree hin qabu.
This is not knowing the truth.	Kun dhugaa jiru beekuu miti.
The timing is good.	Yeroon gaarii dha.
I couldn't do much with her.	Ishee waliin waan baay'ee hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
He couldn’t see any of it.	Inni tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
I couldn’t have it.	Ani qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
But that was one.	Garuu sun tokko ture.
Just like me.	Akkuma koo.
Now everyone does it.	Amma namni hundi ni godha.
He was always right.	Yeroo hundumaa sirrii ture.
I only saw her once.	Yeroo tokko qofa ishee arge.
Who did this?	Eenyutu kana godhe?
he wanted to ask.	jedhee gaafachuu barbaade.
That was a really important interview.	Sun gaaffii fi deebii dhuguma barbaachisaa ture.
Living there with friends.	Hiriyyoota waliin achi jiraachuu.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
But in more and more cases, that's irrelevant.	Garuu yeroo baay'ee fi baay'ee keessatti, sun barbaachisaa miti.
This happened a lot.	Kun baayyee ta'e.
No one got out of the car.	Namni konkolaataa keessaa ba'e hin jiru.
But to me it is very different.	Ana bira garuu baayyee adda.
We had to have your help.	Gargaarsa keessan qabaachuu qabna turre.
Such a person.	Nama akkasii.
We had worked so hard for this day.	Guyyaa kanaaf akka malee hojjenne turre.
He was the only person who loved me.	Nama na jaallatu isa qofa ture.
There was no one there.	Namni achi hin turre.
This was extremely simple.	Kun garmalee salphaa ture.
Things looked really good.	Wanti dhuguma gaarii fakkaata ture.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
We were only together for an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko qofa waliin turre.
I really didn’t want to know.	Dhuguma beekuu hin barbaanne.
I couldn't tell you why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sitti himuu hin dandeenye.
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii dha.
We hope you don’t know.	Akka hin beekne abdii qabna.
He needs the money.	Maallaqa sana isa barbaachisa.
So far, so good.	Hanga ammaatti, akkas gaarii.
This one is you.	Inni kun si.
Not so much here, though.	Asitti hangas miti, garuu.
Picture still even.	Suuraa ammallee illee.
That is not the case here.	Asitti akkas miti.
I looked around.	Anis naannoo koo ilaale.
But you have to know.	Garuu beekuu qabda.
But maybe this is a mistake.	Garuu tarii kun dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
This time there was no hope.	Yeroo kana abdiin hin turre.
You have nowhere to go.	Bakka deemtu hin qabdu.
Just kidding with you.	Si waliin qoosaa qofa.
You know how and why this happens.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'uu fi maaliif akka ta'u ni beektu.
These people have jobs.	Namoonni kun hojii qabu.
I want to be more than a wife and mother.	Haadha manaa fi haadha caalaa ta'uu barbaada.
So, a lot of it.	Kanaaf, baay'ee.
I want to work with you.	Si waliin hojjechuu barbaada.
That was too easy.	Sun garmalee salphaa ture.
She doesn't have it.	Ishee hin qabdu.
There is nothing any of you can do.	Isin keessaa wanti tokkollee gochuu danda'u hin jiru.
He did two things.	Waan lama hojjete.
If something happens, it happens.	Yoo wanti tokko ta'e ni ta'a.
Not even his mother.	Haadha isaa illee miti.
You have to stay indoors.	Mana keessa turuu qabda.
You both love the outdoors.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu ala jiru ni jaallattu.
Just look at us.	Nu ilaalaa qofa.
He has spoken, and he must be.	Dubbateera, ta'uu qaba.
She had a chance.	Carraa qabdi turte.
No one likes him.	Namni isa jaallatu hin jiru.
I am one of the people.	Ani namoota keessaa tokko.
They didn’t have enough food.	Nyaata gahaa hin qaban turan.
They are extremely dangerous.	Isaan garmalee balaa qabu.
It was a really bad time.	Dhuguma yeroo hamaa ture.
Time probably got the better of them.	Yeroon tarii isaan caalaa argate.
She didn’t have to.	Isheen dirqama hin turre.
Today he told me why.	Har'a maaliif akka ta'e natti hime.
Soon, they will come to you.	Yeroo dhiyootti, gara kee ni dhufu.
Not much, but some.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane tokko tokko.
She certainly knew.	Isheen akka beektu beekamaadha.
He obviously has something going for him.	Waan itti deemu akka qabu ifaadha.
He didn’t have a book.	Kitaaba hin qabu ture.
It is possible today.	Har'a ni danda'ama.
You must come back to me tonight this week.	Torban halkan kana gara kootti deebi'uu qabda.
Good times there.	Yeroo gaarii achitti.
She was like that.	Isheen akkas turte.
It can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u.
We had time.	Yeroo qabna turre.
There is nothing here for him.	Isaaf asitti homaa hin jiru.
I don't want to see this happen.	Kun akka ta'u arguu hin barbaadu.
You always know where he is.	Yeroo hundumaa eessa akka jiru ni beekta.
He bought a new pair of shoes.	Kophee haaraa bite.
The light in her eyes.	Ifa ija ishee irratti.
It's not going to be easy.	Salphaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
I have feelings they don’t have.	Miira isaan hin qabne qaba.
In that case we have a problem.	Haala sana keessatti rakkoo qabna.
You can’t stay here!	As turuu hin dandeessu!
I'm not exactly sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku.
Little.	Xiqqoo.
Not exactly the same but still good.	Sirriitti wal fakkaatu miti garuu ammas gaarii dha.
I can't leave him there.	Achitti isa dhiisuu hin danda'u.
I know someone knows what I was looking for.	Waanan barbaadaa ture namni tokko akka beeku nan beeka.
You can see that.	Sana arguu dandeessu.
I know this is the worst time of the year.	Yeroon kun yeroo waggaa keessaa isa hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka.
Someone came out of my house.	Namni tokko mana koo keessaa ba'e.
I didn’t intend to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf hin yaadne.
We don’t have that here.	Asitti akkas hin qabnu.
To do this, she had to eat.	Kana gochuuf, nyaachuu qabdi turte.
I mean, really, it was.	Dhuguma, akkas ture jechuu kooti.
She has a lot of them.	Isaan baay'ee qabdi.
We need to eat food.	Nyaata nyaachuu qabna.
I wouldn’t have thought of that.	Silaa akkas hin yaadu ture.
So tell me about it.	Kanaaf natti himi.
It’s my car.	Konkolaataa kooti.
I need the money.	Maallaqa na barbaachisa.
Neither of them exists.	Isaan lamaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
Perhaps he is not there.	Tarii inni achi hin jiru taʼa.
No one knew where he was.	Namni eessa akka jiru beeku hin turre.
Nothing came out.	Wanti ba'e hin jiru.
No one is up here but the two of them, and the bad guys.	Isaan lamaan malee namni as ol hin jiru, fi namoota hamaa.
It can't be her.	Ishee ta'uu hin danda'u.
I don't have to believe it.	Ani amanuu hin qabu.
That's right.	Sun sirrii dha.
I mean a little, well.	Xiqqoo, gaarii jechuu kooti.
They are both.	Isaan lamaan.
It’s not just about money.	Maallaqa qofa miti.
We were not alone.	Nuti kophaa keenya hin turre.
They should have just asked.	Silaa gaafachuu qofa qabu turan.
It was really too much.	Dhuguma garmalee ture.
You don't know.	Hin beektu.
No one saw it coming.	Namni dhufuu isaa arge hin jiru.
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa ta'uu hin qabu.
But only one wife.	Garuu haadha manaa tokko qofa.
He tried a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee yaale.
I can't stay.	Turuu hin danda'u.
That's how he tried.	Akkasitti yaale.
But that doesn't mean much.	Garuu sun waan baay'ee jechuu miti.
She had some stuff going on.	Waan tokko tokko deemaa ture qabdi turte.
I can't help him.	Isa gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Hope it helps you.	Akka si gargaaru abdii qabna.
It’s not like it used to be anymore.	Kana booda akka duraan ture miti.
I don’t want to give anything away.	Ani homaa kennuu hin barbaadu.
Not that it matters, really.	Dhimma qaba jechuu miti, dhuguma.
This can't just be about you.	Kun waa'ee kee qofa ta'uu hin danda'u.
But only to a certain extent.	Garuu hanga tokko qofa.
Being a mother.	Haadha ta'uu.
That’s all we can do.	Kana qofa gochuu dandeenyu.
He didn’t quite know what he was doing.	Waan hojjetu sirriitti hin beeku ture.
Lots of noise.	Sagalee baay’ee.
It is more accurate than anything else.	Waan hundumaa caalaa sirrii dha.
Sometimes it would happen.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni taʼa ture.
Something that.	Waan tokko kan.
This is a very good thing.	Kun waan baayyee gaarii dha.
It was devoid of real emotion.	Miira dhugaa kan hin qabne ture.
We can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
I’ve been like that my whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu akkas ture.
You are a good guy.	Ati gurbaa gaarii dha.
That’s all.	Sana hunda.
But you could do it.	Garuu gochuu dandeessa turte.
I am happy with this prospect.	Abdii kanaan gammadeera.
This, of course, is not true.	Kun, dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But he can see you.	Inni garuu si arguu danda'a.
It’s not us.	Nu miti.
He had them.	Isaan qaba ture.
Just stay, stay, stay.	Turuu, turuu, turuu qofa.
Most of the time he did nothing.	Yeroo baayyee homaa hin goone.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
I love you for it.	Itti si jaalladha.
We have this.	Kana qabna.
You must return but not return.	Deebi'uu malee deebi'uu dhiisuu qabda.
In some cases.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti.
I never had that much money.	Maallaqa hamma kanaa gonkumaa hin qabu ture.
I still don’t do that.	Ammas akkas hin godhu.
You look like a couple of good guys.	Isin ijoollee gaarii tokko lama fakkaattu.
He didn't do any of it.	Tokkollee hin hojjenne.
I don't say anything.	Ani homaa hin jedhu.
There is indeed.	Dhuguma ni jira.
It won't be a problem anymore.	Kana booda rakkoo hin ta'u.
I think this might help.	Kun gargaaruu danda'a jedheen yaada.
I'm not as quick.	Ani akka dafee hin ta'u.
That was it.	Sun ture.
Even more than you have.	Kan qabdu caalaa illee.
I know you did some of that.	Sana keessaa muraasa akka goote nan beeka.
I can find something else to do.	Waan biraa hojjechuu danda'u argachuu nan danda'a.
He's doing fine.	Inni gaarii hojjechaa jira.
I don't have to go back anymore.	Kana booda duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
I have to go.	Ani deemuun qaba.
No one else could know this.	Namni biraa kana beekuu hin dandeenye.
But tonight it wasn’t.	Halkan kana garuu hin turre.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
As in yours and mine.	Akkuma kan kee fi kan koo keessatti.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
I think they still have it.	Ammas waan qaban natti fakkaata.
It doesn't happen, though.	Hin ta'u garuu.
Everything he said was true.	Wanti inni dubbate hundi dhugaa ture.
There is no more free.	Kana booda tola hin jiru.
They had time.	Yeroo qaban turan.
That was a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ture.
I told you about me.	Waa'ee koo sitti hime.
I need your help.	Gargaarsa keessan barbaada.
But no one ignored it.	Garuu namni bira darbe hin turre.
I don't know why this is happening.	Kun maaliif akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
Our worst mistake.	Dogoggora keenya isa hamaa.
A lot of things happen.	Wanti baay'een ni ta'a.
We need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna.
But he is not the same.	Garuu inni tokko miti.
It was a very good life.	Jireenya baayyee gaarii ture.
More than this time.	Yeroo kana caalaa.
He hadn't spoken, but he hadn't needed to.	Inni hin dubbanne ture, garuu hin barbaachifne ture.
It’s not this thing.	Waan kana miti.
People could see it now.	Namoonni amma arguu dandaʼu turan.
I never want to see him again.	Kana booda yoomiyyuu isa arguu hin barbaadu.
But that's how this one happened.	Garuu inni kun akkasitti ta'e.
It wasn’t very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa hin turre.
It came to him that he should not be alone.	Kophaa ta'uu hin qabu jedhee itti dhufe.
At the same time, it was such a great year.	Kanuma waliin bara guddaa akkasii ture.
Our job was to do all this work.	Hojiin keenya hojii kana hunda hojjechuu ture.
I can't do anything else.	Waan biraa hojjechuu hin danda'u.
So it goes away.	Kanaaf ni deema.
I wanted to, you know that.	Ani barbaade, ati kana beekta.
He had a chance.	Carraa qaba ture.
Of course, that was easier said than done.	Sun dubbachuu caalaa gochuu caalaa salphaa akka ture beekamaadha.
I don’t think she even needs help.	Gargaarsa illee waan barbaaddu natti hin fakkaatu.
This thing here, that thing there.	Wanti kun asitti, wanti sun achitti.
No one knows.	Namni beeku hin jiru.
I don't like her very much.	Ani baay'ee ishee hin jaalladhu.
They love each other very much.	Baay'ee wal jaallatu.
We have the where and the how, now we need the when.	Eessa fi akkamitti kan jedhu qabna, amma kan yoom nu barbaachisa.
Become them.	Isaan ta'aa.
He has to do something great today.	Har'a waan guddaa hojjechuu qaba.
No one can really say.	Dhuguma namni jechuu danda'u hin jiru.
Just one of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokko qofa.
But she won’t be here for long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraaf as hin jirtu.
I had no idea how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e yaada hin qabu ture.
Everyone is different.	Namni hundi adda adda.
I no longer have this problem.	Kana booda rakkoon kun hin qabu.
All the way home.	Karaa manaa hunda.
I really love him, you know.	Ani dhuguma isa jaalladha, beekta.
But that's not going to happen.	Garuu sun hin ta'u.
Three weeks later.	Torban sadii booda.
Another year of living indoors.	Waggaa biraa mana keessa jiraachuu.
You can get it for me.	Naaf argachuu dandeessu.
We are on the road.	Karaa irra jirra.
He was here before.	Dura as ture.
She said he gave it to you.	Inni siif kenne jette.
It doesn’t matter that she wants it.	Akka isheen barbaaddu homaa hin qabu.
But this doesn’t work.	Garuu kun hin hojjetu.
You have to do the work for me.	Hojii sana naaf hojjechuu qabda.
Hopefully things will be different this time.	Yeroo kana wanti adda ta'u abdii qabna.
It was that simple.	Akkas salphaa ture.
It wasn’t bad.	Hamaa hin turre.
If so, you are right.	Yoo akkas ta'e sirrii dha.
No one else can do the job.	Namni biraa hojii sana hojjechuu hin danda'u.
I was the life.	Ani jireenya ture.
This was not quite the same.	Kun guutummaatti wal hin fakkaatu ture.
She still can’t see him.	Ammas isa arguu hin dandeessu.
These people are nice.	Namoonni kun namatti tola.
Still there was something different about him, she didn't know what it was.	Ammas wanti adda ta'e isa keessa ture, isheen maal akka ta'e hin beektu turte.
There was nothing he could do here.	Asitti wanti inni godhu hin turre.
I started part time last year.	Bara darbe yeroo muraasaaf jalqabe.
He has two houses.	Mana lama qaba.
I shouldn't say that.	Akkas jechuu hin qabu.
Tell me now.	Amma natti himi.
He wants the truth.	Dhugaa barbaada.
She had no one else.	Nama biraa hin qabdu turte.
Then it worked well.	Sana booda akka gaariitti hojjete.
That doesn’t work here.	Sun asitti hin hojjetu.
What are they doing?	Maal irra jiru?
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
It would be his job.	Silaa hojii isaa ta'a.
They were into something else.	Isaan waan biraa keessa turan.
Maybe not later tonight but tomorrow.	Tarii booda halkan kana osoo hin taane boru ta'uu danda'a.
I want to do a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu nan barbaada.
Now they are among us big time.	Amma yeroo guddaa nu keessa jiru.
You're in the past.	Ati yeroo darbe.
So no one went.	Kanaaf namni hin deemne.
This afternoon, maybe.	Har'a waaree booda, tarii.
Just like you do.	Akkuma ati gootu.
They knew why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ni beeku turan.
But you don't have what you have.	Waan qabdu garuu hin qabne.
It sounds simple but it’s not.	Salphaa fakkaata garuu akkas miti.
There are a lot of people right now.	Namoonni baay'een yeroo ammaa jiru.
I know their children, some of them.	Ijoollee isaanii nan beeka, isaan keessaa tokko tokko.
It may not be more than it seems.	Waan fakkaatu caalaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
That was what she really wanted.	Wanti isheen baayʼee barbaaddu kanuma ture.
There is nothing more.	Kana caalaa hin jiru.
Nothing, really.	Homaa hin qabu, dhuguma.
I have friends with money.	Hiriyyoota qarshii qaban qaba.
You’ve been good to me.	Ati naaf gaarii taate.
You didn’t have to go to school.	Mana barumsaa deemuun si hin barbaachifne.
She didn't know what happened.	Waan ta'e hin beekne turte.
It wasn’t right.	Sirrii hin turre.
Clearly, he did not have much to say about me.	Waaʼee koo waan baayʼee akka itti hin dubbanne ifaadha.
Now it’s his job.	Amma hojii isaa.
I don't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
They might get lucky.	Carraa argachuu danda'u.
I don't know what to tell you.	Waan sitti himu hin beeku.
He has a house.	Mana qaba.
This is going to be your season.	Kun bara keessan ta'uuf deema.
I knew it was coming.	Akka dhufu nan beeka ture.
He wants to play, but there’s no one else around	Taphachuu barbaada, garuu namni biraa naannoo sana jiru hin jiru
I was there.	Ani achi ture.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
I couldn’t believe I didn’t know her.	Ishee hin beekne jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye.
Just like she was.	Akkuma isheen turte.
So it was great.	Kanaaf guddaa ture.
It has a place to go and a place to be.	Bakka itti deemu fi bakka itti ta'u qaba.
It’s a mistake.	Dogoggora dha.
I don't like it.	Ani hin jaalladhu.
They can tell you.	Isaan sitti himuu danda'u.
That's it.	Kanuma.
They had much in common.	Waan baayʼee wal fakkaatu qabu turan.
No one can help me.	Namni na gargaaruu hin danda'u.
But if you have to go, you have to.	Garuu yoo deemuun dirqama ta'e dirqama.
They always did great things.	Yeroo hundumaa waan guddaa hojjetu turan.
I probably don't have it.	Ani tarii hin qabu.
But, we did it.	Garuu, ni goone.
That’s just my feeling.	Sun miira koo qofa.
Think about it.	Mee yaadu.
I can't have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin danda'u.
She was obviously in a lot of trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa akka turte ifaadha.
You couldn’t do that.	Ati akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I have a new favorite.	Ani jaalladhu haaraa qaba.
But we certainly don’t need to go any further.	Garuu kana caalaa deemuun akka nu hin barbaachifne beekamaadha.
Among many other things.	Waan hedduu keessaa.
She doesn't care here.	Asitti dhimma hin qabdu.
I wish it was me.	Osoo ana ta'ee natti tola.
This has always been his problem.	Kun yeroo hundumaa rakkoo isaa ture.
Maybe that's what he doesn't understand.	Tarii waan inni hin hubanne kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
That was just this morning.	Sun ganama kana qofa ture.
That is obviously not true.	Sun dhugaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
That was one thing.	Sun waan tokko ture.
They love to play.	Taphachuu ni jaallatu.
But it’s nothing else.	Garuu waan biraa miti.
They might get another girl next week.	Torban dhufu intala biraa argachuu danda'u.
They say there is no good work.	Hojii gaarii hin jiru jedhu.
Sorry?	Dhiifama?
Not out yet!.	Ammallee ala miti!.
But he’s kidding.	Garuu inni qoosaa jira.
These go together.	Isaan kun waliin deemu.
He had no obligation.	Dirqama hin qabu ture.
I mean, it should be.	Ta'uu qaba jechuu kooti.
They would have known this wasn’t going to happen for a while.	Silaa yeroo muraasaaf kana akka hin taane beeku turan.
So nice!.	Kanaaf namatti tola!.
He knew he looked good.	Inni gaarii akka fakkaatu ni beeka ture.
I don't have to do it.	Ani gochuu hin qabu.
Take a look!	Mee ilaalaa!
They are good at this.	Kana irratti ga'umsa qaban.
Just the right place.	Bakka sirrii qofa.
I don't think it will ever happen.	Yoomiyyuu waan ta'u natti hin fakkaatu.
But they have two other problems.	Garuu rakkoo biraa lama qabu.
We are here to stay.	Nuti as jirra.
He didn't speak again.	Ammas hin dubbanne.
It’s a mistake.	Dogoggora dha.
We should come here often.	Yeroo baayʼee as dhufuu qabna.
Just because you know something doesn’t mean everyone knows it.	Waan tokko beekta jechuun namni hundi ni beeka jechuu miti.
This was true.	Kun dhugaa ture.
One of us, now.	Tokko keenya, amma.
That was what you said.	Kan ati jette kanuma ture.
We went with that.	Sana waliin deemne.
He was in school full time.	Yeroo guutuu mana barumsaa ture.
The children's language became mine.	Afaan ijoollee kan koo ta'e.
They have to do everything for him.	Waan hundumaa isaaf gochuu qabu.
I don't have any money now.	Amma qarshii hin qabu.
It was his reputation.	Maqaa gaarii isaa ture.
Fortunately, they were alone at the time.	Akka carraa ta'ee yeroo sanatti kophaa isaanii turan.
He hadn’t thought of that.	Inni akkas hin yaadne ture.
It’s just that it’s not.	Akka hin taane qofa.
Two things so simple.	Wantoota lama akkas salphaa.
Sometimes things are not right.	Yeroo tokko tokko wanti sirrii miti.
He says nothing about his father.	Waa'ee abbaa isaa homaa hin jedhu.
You don’t have to do it.	Ati gochuu hin qabdu.
Everything was wrong out here.	As ala wanti hundi dogoggora ture.
Look at my mother.	Haadha koo ilaalaa.
He always did.	Yoomiyyuu ni godhe.
It’s something completely new.	Waan guutummaatti haaraa dha.
It was never the same again.	Amma booda gonkumaa akka durii hin turre.
Everyone here does.	Namni as jiru hundi ni godha.
There was only one other possibility.	Carraan biraa tokko qofa ture.
We’ll both still be around.	Lamaan keenyayyuu ammallee naannoo sana ni jirra.
It took up a lot of space.	Bakka baay'ee fudhate.
She’s not looking at anything.	Isheen homaa ilaalaa hin jirtu.
I was very excited.	Ani baay'ee gammade.
She was still with him.	Ammallee isa waliin turte.
It’s completely fine.	Guutummaatti gaarii dha.
Those are mine.	Isaan sun kan kooti.
We are here now.	Amma as jirra.
To do what’s important, not what’s easy.	Waan salphaa ta’e osoo hin taane waan barbaachisaa ta’e hojjechuuf.
I don't know anything about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku.
Which is pretty good.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e.
But it was great.	Garuu guddaa ture.
What are you?.	Ati maal?.
He has a good reputation.	Maqaa gaarii qaba.
I won't say it anymore.	Kana booda hin jedhu.
He wouldn't tell me much else about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan biraa baay'ee natti hin himu ture.
He knew what to do.	Waan godhu beeka ture.
It is still clear outside.	Ammas ala ifaadha.
I knew nothing about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture.
He says.	Jedha.
I couldn’t ask my mother.	Haadha koo gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
That will never happen.	Sun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
We’re just kids.	Nuti ijoollee qofa.
That's a really unique environment to work in.	Sun dhuguma naannoo adda ta'e keessa hojjechuuf.
Look at the picture.	Suuraa ilaalaa.
Always.	Yeroo hundumaa.
We have to go together, tonight.	Waliin deemuu qabna, halkan kana.
This works fine.	Kun gaarii hojjeta.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Now she had only one job.	Amma hojii tokko qofa qabdi turte.
They can belong to him if .	Isaan kan isaa ta'uu danda'u yoo .
She was in a bad mood that day.	Guyyaa sana miira hamaa keessa turte.
Tonight could be his lucky night.	Halkan kana halkan carraa isaa ta'uu danda'a.
They were too long.	Garmalee dheeraa turan.
You must always tell the truth.	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa dubbachuu qabda.
I'm happy for you.	Siif gammadeera.
She was fine.	Isheen gaarii turte.
He told her he couldn’t stay.	Turuu akka hin dandeenye itti hime.
I know these are bad times.	Yeroon kun yeroo hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka.
But maybe it's true.	Garuu tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
He seemed to be asleep.	Hirriba keessa waan jiru fakkaata ture.
That we could just go home.	Akka qofa gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeenyu.
Someone else with him.	Nama biraa isa waliin.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
Definitely not a good idea.	Yaada gaarii akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You don't do that.	Waan akkasii hin gootu.
No one knows where she is.	Eessa akka jirtu namni beeku hin jiru.
Our whole lives.	Jireenya keenya guutuu.
He wanted her to leave.	Akka isheen deemtu barbaade.
I hadn’t thought of that.	Sana hin yaadne ture.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
That was enough, for the most part.	Sun gahaa ture, irra caalaa.
I had no hand in any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee harka hin qabu ture.
Not in their environment.	Naannoo isaanii keessatti miti.
But she wasn't here.	Garuu isheen as hin turre.
This one is different.	Inni kun adda.
It has something in common with yourself.	Waan ofii kee wajjin wal fakkaatu qaba.
He really goes there.	Inni dhuguma achi deema.
He seemed to be a non-existent person.	Nama waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
Look me in the eye.	Ija keessa na ilaalaa.
But they love each other.	Garuu wal jaallatu.
I still have a lot of questions.	Ammallee gaaffii baay'ee qaba.
You are not an accident.	Ati balaa miti.
That's pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii dha.
But he didn’t tell his father.	Garuu abbaa isaatti hin himne.
It shouldn't be a problem for you.	Rakkoo siif ta'uu hin qabu.
That much I can say.	Hamma kana jechuu nan danda'a.
But he thinks they shouldn't have been.	Garuu silaa ta'uu hin qaban jedhee yaada.
They shouldn’t play with them.	Isaan waliin taphachuu hin qaban.
It always happened.	Yeroo hundumaa ni ta'a ture.
It wouldn't have been long.	Silaa dheeraa hin ta'u ture.
I think about my mother.	Waa'ee haadha koo nan yaada.
I will do many things for you.	Ani waan baay'ee siif nan godha.
What could be more?	Kana caalaa maaltu jiraachuu dandaʼa?
You don't know how it's going to happen.	Akkamitti akka ta'u hin beektu.
I think we should play.	Taphachuu qabna jedheen yaada.
It always works.	Yeroo hunda hojjeta.
Sometimes he is right.	Yeroo tokko tokko sirrii dha.
I’m not interested in all that.	Sana hunda irratti fedhii hin qabu.
He found me last year.	Bara darbe na argate.
I thought I knew him.	Ani waanan isa beeku natti fakkaate.
I can't say enough good things about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
There needs to be something else in this.	Kana keessatti wanti tokko wanti biraa jiraachuu barbaada.
I think that could go one of two ways.	Sun karaa lama keessaa tokko deemuu danda'a jedheen yaada.
But no one else can do it.	Garuu namni biraa gochuu hin danda'u.
It could be tomorrow.	Boru ta'uu danda'a.
But not anymore.	Garuu kana booda miti.
He has to work.	Inni hojjechuu qaba.
It was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture.
He was happy with the idea.	Yaada sanatti gammade.
Good times indeed.	Yeroo gaarii dhuguma.
No one spoke to him.	Namni itti dubbate hin jiru.
In life, really.	Jireenya keessatti, dhuguma.
Which is wrong.	Kan dogoggora ta'e.
I don't know how much.	Meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku.
Available.	Jira.
Most of the time people had good intentions.	Yeroo baayyee namoonni yaada gaarii qabu turan.
You are going to do this right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana kana gochuuf jirta.
Unless you are.	Yoo taate malee.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
We saw it together in a bar.	Mana dhugaatii tokko keessatti waliin argine.
He loves this.	Kana ni jaallata.
That this was different.	Kun adda akka ture.
I am very happy right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana baay'een gammadeera.
He obviously loves the job.	Hojii sana akka jaallatu ifaadha.
But when she needed a guy, he wasn’t there.	Garuu yeroo isheen gurbaa barbaaddu inni achi hin turre.
So it wasn’t easy.	Kanaaf salphaa hin turre.
I love that idea.	Yaada sana baay'een jaalladha.
She never did it.	Isheen gonkumaa hin goone.
said.	jedhe.
He looked at his watch.	Sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
But you can’t come with us.	Garuu nu waliin dhufuu hin dandeessu.
Just look at it.	Mee ilaalaa qofa.
There is no later.	Booda hin jiru.
I told my mom it was no big deal.	Waan guddaa miti jedheen haadha kootti hime.
He wants what he can’t have.	Waan qabaachuu hin dandeenye barbaada.
I am a very good person.	Ani nama baayyee gaarii dha.
Like, the real one.	Akka, kan dhugaa.
I couldn’t do it as well as she did.	Akka isheen goote akka gaariitti hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
We were on the road for three months.	Ji'a sadii karaa irra turre.
It’s like this, not like that.	Akkasitti malee akkas miti.
I didn't see this.	Kana hin argine.
Maybe it could work.	Tarii hojjechuu danda'a.
I was sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa ture.
I don’t know, not really.	Hin beeku, dhuguma miti.
You could see it in his eyes.	Ija isaa keessatti arguu dandeessa turte.
We can't go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
This was never going to work.	Kun gonkumaa hojjechuuf hin turre.
It was one of my favorite places to go.	Bakka ani itti deemu baayʼee jaalladhu keessaa tokko ture.
All complete, of course.	Hundi isaanii guutuu, beekamaadha.
That’s not all, though.	Kana qofa miti garuu.
Were they right?.	Sirrii turan?.
That is no longer true.	Kana booda sun dhugaa miti.
This doesn't work.	Kun hin hojjetu.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
I just told him that.	Anis akkas qofa itti hime.
He didn't quite know what his mouth was doing to them.	Afaan isaa maal akka isaan godhu baayyee hin beeku ture.
I'm not sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti.
She was obviously expecting this question.	Gaaffii kana eegaa akka turte ifaadha.
I really need to know that he will always love me.	Dhuguma yeroo hundumaa akka na jaallatu beekuu qaba.
They are going really big.	Dhuguma guddaa deemaa jiru.
But this was something very different.	Garuu kun waan baayyee adda ture.
It’s not us, it’s them.	Nu miti, isaan.
I thought we were.	Akka waan taane natti fakkaate.
That was a little while ago.	Sun yeroo xiqqoo dura ture.
This doesn’t help people.	Kun namoota hin gargaaru.
We have the answer.	Deebii isaa qabna.
They know she was here.	As akka turte ni beeku.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
They are the same age.	Isaan umuriin isaanii tokko.
Good, but that’s it.	Gaarii, garuu kanuma.
You don’t want to do this.	Kana gochuu hin barbaaddu.
It seemed.	Fakkaate.
This is me!	Kun ana!
This is not enough.	Kun gahaa miti.
Perhaps he could not.	Tarii hin dandeenye taʼa.
It wasn’t anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin turre.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
What can I tell you though.	Maal sitti himi garuu.
Now it's getting bigger.	Amma guddaa ta'aa jira.
It’s just too big.	Garmalee guddaa qofa.
We couldn’t see what we saw.	Waan argine arguu hin dandeenye.
I knew that voice.	Sagalee sana nan beeka ture.
You had no ideas that weren’t your own.	Yaada kan kee hin taane hin qabdu turte.
But a lot of things that shouldn't happen happen.	Garuu wanti ta'uu hin qabne baay'een ni ta'a.
This one had it.	Inni kun qaba ture.
Clearly he was in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa akka ture ifaadha.
Better without him.	Isa malee wayya.
You weren’t there.	Ati hin turre.
It was in front of my eyes.	Ija koo dura ture.
I hope we have some of the same interests.	Fedhii wal fakkaatu tokko tokko akka qabnu abdiin qaba.
I can't see how it can survive.	Akkamitti jiraachuu akka danda'u arguu hin danda'u.
But in two cases we are lucky.	Garuu haala lama keessatti carraa guddaa qabna.
It's exactly right.	Sirriitti sirrii dha.
You can play it.	Taphachuu dandeessu.
Coming and going was not easy.	Dhufuu fi deemuun salphaa hin turre.
Not everyone would have it.	Silaa namni hundi hin qabu ture.
I have a lot to think about.	Waan baay'ee itti yaadu qaba.
The problem was how.	Rakkoon ture akkamitti.
Not both of us.	Lamaan keenya miti.
Everything takes time.	Wanti hundi yeroo barbaada.
It stands to reason that this would be true.	Kun dhugaa ta’a jechuun sababa qaba.
He is still here.	Ammallee as jira.
If it works, great.	Yoo hojjete guddaa.
But that everything is nothing.	Garuu wanti hundi homaa akka hin taane.
She hadn’t meant to do that.	Isheen akkas gochuuf hin yaadne turte.
There is a reason.	Sababni jira.
Tell them what you think is good.	Waan gaarii sitti fakkaate itti himi.
You have to get it right with this.	Kana waliin sirriitti argachuu qabda.
At the time, however, it never seemed inevitable.	Yeroo sanatti garuu gonkumaa waan hin oolle hin fakkaatu.
Really, really bad.	Dhugaa, dhugaa hamaa.
You may not understand this.	Kana siif hin galle ta'a.
He lived with his mother.	Haadha isaa waliin jiraata ture.
It is in and around us.	Nu keessa fi naannoo keenya jira.
We don’t need any more.	Kana caalaa nu hin barbaachisu.
This time had to be right.	Yeroon kun sirrii ta’uu qaba ture.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
We in this room.	Nu kutaa kana keessa.
Tell yourself you don’t want the food.	Nyaata sana akka hin barbaanne ofitti himi.
That prospect seemed realistic.	Abdiin sun waan dhugaa taʼe fakkaata ture.
Just so, so .	Akkas qofa, akkas .
People have to live on it.	Namoonni irra jiraachuu qabu.
I can't do it.	Ani gochuu hin danda'u.
But we soon got together.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti waliin taane.
She said my name.	Maqaa koo jette.
Please take a look	Mee ilaalaa .
Now, it’s not a problem.	Amma, rakkoo miti.
He couldn't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin dandeenye.
I enjoyed it too.	Anis itti gammadeera.
Maybe that was okay.	Tarii sun homaa hin turre ta'a.
I don’t really know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu sirriitti hin beeku.
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
I didn’t want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne.
There is nothing on them.	Isaan irratti homaa hin jiru.
He loves it.	Inni ni jaallata.
This was new.	Kun haaraa ture.
I love you girl.	Si jaalladha intala.
It could not have been better.	Silaa kana caalaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
We didn’t know you.	Nuti si hin beekne.
She was such a good dog.	Isheen saree gaarii akkasii turte.
I'm sure you know these things.	Wantoota kana akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
He seems to like it.	Inni waan jaallatu fakkaata.
It will be good to see him later.	Booda yoo isa argine gaarii ta'a.
There is not so much more.	Kana caalaa hangas hin jiru.
He still hadn’t said enough.	Ammallee gahaa hin dubbanne ture.
But this is not that day.	Garuu kun guyyaa sana miti.
Look at me, mother.	Na ilaalaa haadha.
But he’s not here yet.	Garuu ammallee as hin jiru.
You have to believe me.	Na amanuu qabdu.
I don’t quite understand why she would do that.	Maaliif akkas akka gootu sirriitti naaf hin galle.
It won't do you any good.	Gaarii tokkollee siif hin ta'u.
It is in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jira.
In a small room.	Kutaa xiqqoo tokko keessatti.
I will still do whatever it takes.	Ammas waan barbaachisu hunda nan godha.
I can work with that.	Sana waliin hojjechuu nan danda'a.
It's just not going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin deemu qofa.
It just has to.	Qaba qofa.
Why does no one help us?	Maaliif namni nu hin gargaaru?
When not now?.	Amma hin taane yoom?.
Maybe better than you know yourself.	Tarii of beektu caalaa gaarii ta'a.
We need more than that.	Kana caalaa nu barbaachisa.
Which happened today.	Kan har'a ta'e.
That’s not a new idea.	Sun yaada haaraa miti.
It was really neat.	Dhuguma sirrii ture.
It doesn't look bad.	Hamaa hin fakkaatu.
No comment about that, sorry.	Waa'ee sanaa yaada hin qabu, dhiifama.
It was easy.	Salphaa ture.
No one told him anything.	Namni homaa itti hime hin jiru.
Now we were in it together.	Amma waliin keessa turre.
I'm not going alone.	Ani qofa hin deemu.
I wonder who they might be.	Eenyu ta'uu danda'u jedheen yaada.
It was the whole day before her work.	Guyyaa guutuu hojii ishee dura ture.
He has no wife, no children.	Haadha manaa hin qabu, ijoollee hin qabu.
You know where everything is.	Wanti hundi eessa akka jiru ni beekta.
But that wasn’t an issue.	Garuu sun dhimma hin turre.
I hope that’s not you.	Sun akka ati hin taane abdiin qaba.
It would have been his duty.	Silaa dirqama isaa ta'a ture.
I'm really sorry.	Dhuguma dhiifama.
Everything has to go her way.	Wanti hundi karaa ishee ta'uu qaba.
Very happy to meet you guys.	Isin wal arguu kootti baay'een gammade.
You are making a mistake.	Dogoggora hojjechaa jirta.
Well done.	Gaarii goote.
It seemed great at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan guddaa fakkaata ture.
Being their daughter, but not really their daughter.	Intala isaanii ta'uu, garuu dhuguma intala isaanii miti.
He thought he knew one.	Tokko waan beeku itti fakkaate.
It’s just not that simple.	Akkas salphaa miti qofa.
They couldn’t do enough for you.	Isaan gahaa siif gochuu hin dandeenye.
Tell him what happened.	Waan ta'e itti himi.
I could live without that.	Sana malee jiraachuu nan danda'a ture.
No one saw him.	Namni isa arge hin jiru.
They weren’t going.	Isaan deemaa hin turre.
So look at us like that.	Kanaaf akkasitti nu ilaalaa.
Very early weeks.	Torban baay'ee dafee.
He hadn't been there.	Achi hin turre ture.
It’s just not in him.	Isa keessa hin jiru qofa.
So far all we have is the name.	Hanga ammaatti kan qabnu maqaa qofa.
It has more than enough.	Waan gahaa ol qaba.
My real name.	Maqaa koo isa dhugaa.
I know the way.	Karaa nan beeka.
Love me, love me, love me.	Na jaalladhu, na jaalladhu, na jaalladhu.
Three were bad, one was good.	Sadii hamaa ture, tokko gaarii ture.
Not many did.	Baay'een hin goone.
That he was making me a bad person.	Akka inni nama hamaa na gochaa ture.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
We seem to have something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu waan qabnu fakkaata.
Now you should have some.	Amma tokko tokko qabaachuu qabda.
This is my promise.	Kun waadaa kooti.
She wasn’t there.	Isheen hin turre.
He had little time.	Yeroo xiqqoo qaba ture.
I don’t do it that way.	Ani akkasitti hin godhu.
But at the time it didn’t matter.	Garuu yeroo sanatti homaa hin turre.
But something was very wrong.	Garuu wanti tokko baayyee dogoggora ture.
I’m glad I have it.	Ani qabaachuu kootti gammadeera.
She has many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qabdi.
That one is not true.	Inni sun dhugaa miti.
They’re not as good at their jobs as anyone else.	Hojii isaanii irratti akka nama biraa ga’umsa hin qaban.
I’ve always wanted to go.	Yeroo hundumaa deemuun barbaada ture.
It seemed to come from within.	Keessaa waan dhufe fakkaata ture.
I didn't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beekne.
Glad to have found you.	Si argachuu kootti gammadeera.
Their real names.	Maqaa isaanii isa dhugaa.
All that really matters is going somewhere.	Wanti dhuguma barbaachisaa ta'e bakka tokko deemuu qofa.
They do well here.	Asitti waan gaarii hojjetu.
It didn't happen often.	Yeroo baayyee hin ta'u ture.
A great girl.	Intala guddaa.
It can’t be any other way.	Karaa biraa ta’uu hin danda’u.
That’s your job.	Hojiin kee kanuma.
I couldn’t find one. 	Tokko argachuu hin dandeenye. 
She didn’t want to leave her car there.	Konkolaataa ishee achitti dhiisuu hin barbaanne.
I don’t quite know how to tell you this.	Kana akkamitti akkan sitti himu sirriitti hin beeku.
He obviously isn’t.	Inni akka hin taane ifaadha.
I wasn’t looking at her anymore.	Kana booda ishee ilaalaa hin turre.
I still didn't think about it.	Ammas itti hin yaadne.
Once, please!	Yeroo tokko maaloo!
I couldn’t find anything.	Homaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I wonder what you think.	Maal jettanii yaaddu jedheen yaada.
He was in a school.	Mana barumsaa tokko keessa ture.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
We are not interested.	Fedhii hin qabnu.
We didn’t do that.	Nuti akkas hin goone.
Which she didn’t want to do, not yet.	Kan isheen gochuu hin barbaanne, ammallee hin taane.
I don’t know what worked.	Wanti hojjete hin beeku.
All that matters is the here and now.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e as fi amma qofa.
You.	Ati.
I knew she wanted me.	Akka na barbaaddu nan beeka ture.
It was a terrible place.	Bakka hamaa ture.
But it was a mistake.	Garuu dogoggora ture.
It just has to be.	Ta'uu qofa qaba.
It was a great moment.	Yeroo guddaa ture.
It was a great moment.	Yeroo guddaa ture.
The work is ahead of me.	Hojiin na dura jira.
I have no help.	Gargaarsa hin qabu.
I'm working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa jira.
Terrible, terrible mistake.	Dogoggora hamaa, hamaa hamaa.
That’s not always the case.	Yeroo hunda akkas miti.
He was going to leave.	Inni deemuuf ture.
But of course no one had.	Garuu beekamaadha namni tokkollee hin qabu ture.
You should have seen her.	Silaa ishee arguu qabda turte.
I hope the night wasn’t too loud.	Halkan sun sagalee guddaa akka hin qabne abdiin qaba.
Which will happen soon.	Kan yeroo dhiyootti ta'u.
Certainly not tonight.	Halkan kana akka hin taane beekamaadha.
There’s nothing special about my job.	Waa’ee hojii koo kana keessatti wanti adda ta’e hin jiru.
Not really, but it seemed that way.	Dhuguma miti, garuu akkas fakkaata ture.
He looked into my eyes.	Ija koo keessa ilaale.
I know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
I just can't say.	jechuu qofa hin danda'u.
Not after all this time.	Yeroo kana hunda booda miti.
But those people are wrong.	Garuu namoonni sun dogoggora qabu.
What happened to him?	Maaltu isa ta'e?
He had what he needed.	Waan isa barbaachisu qaba ture.
Very nice guy to work with.	Gurbaa baayyee namatti tola waliin hojjechuuf.
He was the only one who could see here.	Asitti kan arguu danda'u isa qofa ture.
It’s not life.	Jireenya miti.
His work is inevitable.	Hojiin isaa hin oolu.
It’s not on it.	Irratti hin jiru.
But it's good.	Garuu gaarii dha.
You know it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa ni beekta.
This was my husband.	Kun abbaa manaa koo ture.
It seemed like he had been doing this his whole life.	Jireenya isaa guutuu kana waan gochaa ture fakkaata ture.
But this was still this good.	Garuu kun ammallee kun gaarii ture.
He had one hand.	Harka tokko qaba ture.
There is one problem though.	Rakkoon tokko garuu jira.
Like three times.	Akka yeroo sadii.
Well done.	Gaarii goote.
He never wants that.	Inni gonkumaa akkas hin barbaadu.
There is nothing for him but to go.	Deemu malee homaa isaaf hin jiru.
I wasn't in school today.	Har'a mana barumsaa hin turre.
It always happens.	Yeroo hundumaa ni ta'a.
What he did was wrong.	Wanti inni godhe dogoggora ture.
I mean, all the time.	Yeroo hunda jechuu kooti.
And I've never been good at it.	Anis kana irratti gaarii ta'ee hin beeku.
I already know that.	Sana duruu beeka.
Then it happens again.	Sana booda ammas ni ta'a.
I don't know how to tell you what happened.	Waan ta'e akkamitti akkan sitti himu hin beeku.
Maybe he can do this.	Tarii kana gochuu danda'a.
No one should be here.	Namni as jiraachuu hin qabu.
Maybe she was really trying to help.	Tarii dhuguma gargaaruuf yaalaa turte taʼa.
They’re very human-like.	Isaan baay’ee nama fakkaatu.
It was larger than life.	Jireenya caalaa guddaa ture.
I want to know the big whole.	Guutuu guddaa beekuu barbaada.
He worked with my father.	Abbaa koo waliin hojjete.
That was completely wrong.	Sun guutummaatti dogoggora ture.
There were two of us.	Lamaan keenya turre.
I can meet you.	Ani wal arguu nan danda'a.
But it was my only hope.	Garuu abdii koo qofa ture.
Nothing is going to happen.	Wanti ta'uuf deemu hin jiru.
You better go now.	Amma deemuun siif wayya.
But this didn’t last long.	Garuu kun yeroo dheeraaf hin turre.
But they make a very good pair.	Garuu lamaan baayyee gaarii ta'e ni hojjetu.
He was here, watching her.	Inni as ture, ishee ilaalaa ture.
He just might be the one.	Inni qofa ta'uu danda'a.
This one was true.	Inni kun dhugaa ture.
Sounds like it might be the answer.	Deebii ta'uu akka danda'u fakkaata.
There was something else in there.	Wanti biraa achi keessa ture.
Just a feeling about it.	Miira waa'ee isaa qofa.
I couldn’t get an answer.	Deebii argachuu hin dandeenye.
He is on his way now.	Amma karaa irra jira.
It could be that situation you have.	Haala ati qabdu sana ta'uu danda'a.
They will do well.	Isaan gaarii ni hojjetu.
I can never be her.	Ani gonkumaa ishee ta'uu hin danda'u.
Tell him again.	Ammas itti himi.
I didn’t want to be here.	Ani as jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
Sorry for that, but there’s a reason.	Kanaaf dhiifama, garuu sababni jira.
You can do this thing.	Waan kana hojjechuu dandeessa.
Just look at yourself.	Of ilaalaa qofa.
No one wants that!.	Namni akkas hin barbaadu!.
That was always a problem for him.	Sun yeroo hundumaa rakkoo isaaf ture.
Is.	Dha.
No one knew.	Namni beeku hin turre.
He took inside him.	Keessa isaa fudhate.
You became so much more.	Ati baay'ee kan biraa taate.
If he wants to, he can.	Yoo barbaade ni danda'a.
It should be but it isn't.	Ta'uu qaba garuu hin ta'u.
Not like we do, of course.	Akka nuti goonu miti, beekamaadha.
I'm sure you know who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
But it was just the door to another room .	Garuu balbala kutaa biraa qofa ture .
That would be a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ta'a.
But that wouldn’t help.	Garuu sun hin gargaaru ture.
Perhaps he knew.	Tarii beeka ture taʼa.
No one else was inside.	Namni biraa keessa hin turre.
Only never quite enough.	Qofa gonkumaa guutummaatti gahaa miti.
Everything she did.	Waan isheen goote hunda.
I want to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu barbaada.
They are good people.	Namoota gaarii dha.
Now you can see exactly what you want to see.	Amma waan arguu barbaaddu sirriitti arguu dandeessa.
But now it was nothing.	Amma garuu homaa hin turre.
There was nothing she could do to me.	Wanti isheen na gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
What happened had happened.	Wanti ta'e ta'ee ture.
None of them knew her.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee ishee hin beeku ture.
Except at night.	Halkan malee.
That's what happens here.	Asitti akkas ta'a.
I don't want this.	Ani kana hin barbaadu.
The one in question in the morning.	Kan ganama gaaffii keessa jiru.
It seems to be there.	Waan jiru fakkaata.
No one likes him.	Namni isa jaallatu hin jiru.
They were just jokes.	Qoosaa qofa turan.
He wanted a drink.	Dhugaatii barbaade.
When I did that.	Yeroon akkas godhe.
He was the one.	Inni ture.
It would have been a problem.	Silaa rakkoo ta'a ture.
At that point he went to another area.	Yeroo sanatti gara naannoo biraa deeme.
I couldn't stay in here.	As keessa turuu hin dandeenye.
I'm not there.	Ani achi hin jiru.
He wasn't sure how to do it.	Akkamitti akka godhu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
She didn't know this was happening.	Kun akka ta'aa jiru hin beektu turte.
That was all it was.	Kana qofa ture.
I shouldn’t give more.	Kana caalaa kennuu hin qabu.
I didn't know what she said.	Waan isheen jette hin beeku ture.
We have	Qabna .
How do you think this should be?.	Kun akkamitti ta'uu qaba jettanii yaaddu?.
You are my mother.	Ati haadha kooti.
That doesn’t mean he’s human.	Kana jechuun nama miti.
It is in our hands.	Harka keenya keessa jira.
Everyone expected the job to be someone else's problem.	Hojiin sun rakkoo nama biraa ta'a jedhee namni hundi eegaa ture.
He is still there.	Ammas achi jira.
Look closely at what happens there.	Waan achitti ta'u sirriitti ilaalaa.
I didn’t want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne.
Not many people that day.	Guyyaa sana namoota baay'ee miti.
He should have known he would.	Silaa akka inni godhu beekuu qaba ture.
But he didn't know.	Garuu hin beeku ture.
What he wanted from her and why.	Maal ishee irraa barbaade fi maaliif.
Please go this way.	Mee karaa kanaan deemaa.
It’s time we did something.	Yeroon waan tokko hojjenne amma.
None of them could.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin dandeenye.
This stuff is around a lot.	Wanti kun baay'ee naannoo jira.
Her mouth was working.	Afaan ishee hojjechaa ture.
We can't go back.	Deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
You know each other very well.	Baay'ee wal beektu.
Someone just had to find it.	Namni tokko argachuu qofa qaba ture.
That's it.	Kana moo.
He's not there.	Achi hin jiru.
If it was.	Yoo ture.
He's doing fine now.	Amma gaarii hojjechaa jira.
To be clear, this is not a waiting period.	Ifa ta'uuf, kun yeroo eegaa miti.
That's what the boy thought.	Kanuma gurbaa jedhee yaade.
I know it's different here.	Asitti adda akka ta'e nan beeka.
I don't think about it.	Ani itti hin yaadu.
We hadn’t thought of that.	Kana hin yaadne turre.
It was little more than nothing.	Kan homaa hin taane caalaa xiqqoo ture.
It is still unclear who it will be.	Eenyu akka ta'u ammallee ifa miti.
But this is past.	Garuu kun darbe.
She has a job.	Hojii qabdi.
It could be worse!	Kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a!
That they were.	Akka isaan turan.
Still no one came.	Ammas namni dhufe hin jiru.
He is the	Inni kan .
That's when he realized that.	Yeroo sanatti akkas akka taʼe hubate.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	Waan inni gochuu danda'u waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
It’s not a good thing.	Waan gaarii miti.
But he wants you.	Garuu si barbaada.
Not very, very long.	Baay'ee baay'ee dheeraa miti.
But you’re not really here.	Garuu dhuguma as hin jirtu.
It was a terrible problem.	Rakkoo hamaa ture.
I know the area well.	Naannoo sana sirriitti beeka.
The time is now.	Yeroon isaa amma.
Lots of questions.	Gaaffii baay'ee.
Again, it happens at home.	Ammas, mana keessatti ta'a.
Maybe they are.	Tarii isaan ta'uu danda'u.
Clearly, this cannot be the case.	Kun akkas ta’uu akka hin dandeenye ifaadha.
I have a few.	Muraasa qaba.
It doesn’t need to be the only reason.	Sababni isaa qofa ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
Just doing his new layout.	Haala haaraa isaa hojjechuu qofa.
It was working together.	Waliin hojjechuu ture.
We need to be absolutely clear about this.	Waa’ee kanaa guutummaatti ifa ta’uu qabna.
Now he understood.	Amma hubate.
I know this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu nan beeka.
He went to help them.	Isaan gargaaruuf deeme.
This is not a human being.	Kun nama miti.
They would be looking for her now.	Silaa amma ishee barbaadaa jiru.
It shouldn't be a big deal.	Waan guddaa ta'uu hin qabu.
He gave me the money.	Maallaqa sana naaf kenne.
They are that good.	Isaan akkas gaarii dha.
But everything has it.	Garuu wanti hundi qaba.
One of these days I will have to ask my father.	Guyyaa kana keessaa tokko abbaa koo gaafachuu qaba.
Maybe not for another year or so.	Tarii waggaa biraa fi sanaa ol ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
But he wouldn't tell us what happened.    	Garuu waan ta'e nutti hin himu ture.    
It’s my name.	Maqaa kooti.
But you're not just about sleep.	Garuu ati waa'ee hirriba qofa miti.
I was pleased to say.	jedheen gammadeera.
I'll go with him.	Isa waliin nan deema.
That great big light.	Ifa guddaa guddaa sana.
Lots of emotions.	Miira baay'ee.
I knew how to do that.	Akkamitti akkan sana godhu nan beeka ture.
But he said nothing.	Inni garuu homaa hin dubbanne.
He has to go now.	Amma deemuu qaba.
But it seems likely.	Garuu waan ta'uu danda'u fakkaata.
She wasn’t kidding.	Isheen qoosaa hin turre.
He was your father.	Inni abbaa kee ture.
He knows a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee beeka.
We were still there.	Ammas turre.
He is not here.	Inni as hin jiru.
No one said much.	Namni waan baay'ee dubbate hin jiru.
I need one.	Tokko na barbaachisa.
I would go there but not often.	Achi nan deema ture garuu yeroo baayyee miti.
She was very good.	Isheen baayyee gaarii turte.
But there is.	Garuu jira.
He saw the good in people.	Namoota keessatti waan gaarii arge.
Everything seemed to work.	Wanti hundi waan hojjetu fakkaata ture.
He looked dangerous.	Inni balaa fakkaata ture.
Today could have been a really bad day.	Har'a guyyaa dhuguma hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
That place and that day.	Bakka sanaa fi guyyaa sana.
He wasn’t home yet.	Ammallee mana hin turre.
This is not that day.	Kun guyyaa sana miti.
What does the problem look like?	Rakkoon jiru maal fakkaata?
There are only three reasons why this happens to someone.	Nama tokko irratti akkas ta'uuf sababni sadii qofa.
It was her.	Ishee turte.
No one really does.	Namni dhuguma godhu hin jiru.
But not so in this case.	Garuu haala kana keessatti akkas miti.
Other than that, he does nothing.	Kanaan ala homaa hin godhu.
Then they look for him.	Sana booda isa barbaadu.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Sun maal akka ta'e akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
You are doing important work.	Hojii barbaachisaa hojjechaa jirta.
You don’t even have to ask.	Gaafachuu illee hin qabdu.
Only the two of them.	Lamaan isaa qofa.
No one has done that.	Namni akkas godhe hin jiru.
But after a while it didn’t really matter.	Garuu yeroo muraasa booda dhimma guddaa hin qabu ture.
It was still early.	Ammas dafee ture.
I was that guy once.	Ani yeroo tokko gurbaa sana ture.
Like a mother, like a daughter.	Akka haadha, akka intala.
Two months ago.	Ji'a lama dura.
Watch your mouths!	Afaan keessan ilaalaa!
But it was no luck at all.	Garuu tasumaa carraa hin turre.
At my workplace.	Bakka hojii kootti.
Everyone needs to help us.	Namni hundi nu gargaaruu qaba.
things are good there.	achitti wanti gaarii dha.
It's been good.	Gaarii ta'ee jira.
But sometimes later.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko booda.
He really had it.	Dhuguma qaba ture.
But I couldn’t tell him the truth.	Garuu dhugaa jiru itti himuu hin dandeenye.
I know his name.	Maqaa isaa nan beeka.
Everyone knows about that episode.	Waa'ee kutaa sanaa namni hundi ni beeka.
I haven’t seen it before.	Kanaan dura hin argine.
Good.	Gaarii.
She was gone but for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf malee hin jirtu turte.
We may never have this opportunity again.	Kana booda carraa kana gonkumaa argachuu hin dandeenyu ta’a.
But no one does.	Garuu namni hin godhu.
It doesn’t seem like it.	Hin fakkaatu.
All but three of them.	Sadii malee hundi isaanii.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
Look at the section.	Kutaa ilaalaa.
I wasn’t there at the time.	Ani yeroo sana hin turre.
As if it were.	Akka waan.
They are on hand here.	Asitti harka jiru.
You have to help people.	Namoota gargaaruu qabda.
I still can't get the sound to work.	Ammallee sagalee sana akka hojjetu gochuu hin danda'u.
No one spoke specifically.	Namni adda dubbate hin jiru.
I really really have that many pictures.	Dhuguma dhuguma suuraa hamma kanaa qaba.
But you can do the right thing here.	Garuu asitti waan sirrii hojjechuu dandeessa.
It was a good thing.	Waan gaarii ture.
Always expect the best.	Yeroo hundumaa waan gaarii eegaa.
Now he knew what that was.	Amma wanti sun maal akka taʼe beeka ture.
They are no longer mine.	Isaan kana booda kan koo miti.
He wanted to live a life without me.	Jireenya ana malee jiraachuu barbaade.
I don't have anything.	Ani homaa hin qabu.
You’re all in it together.	Hundi keessan waliin keessa jirtu.
But it is not the past.	Garuu kan darbe miti.
It wasn't about that.	Waa'ee kanaa hin turre.
The problem is, someone did.	Rakkoon jiru, namni tokko akkas godhe.
None of them seem to work for me.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan naaf hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
I still have a lot to say.	Ammallee waanan jedhu baay'een qaba.
I can't seem to let that happen.	Ani akkas akka ta'u gochuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
But it was still loud.	Garuu ammas sagalee guddaa qaba ture.
He was a boy.	Gurbaa ture.
I shouldn’t know anything else.	Waan biraa beekuu hin qabu.
That's who he is.	Inni eenyu akka ta'e kanuma.
The real time.	Yeroo dhugaa.
How long ago it seemed.	Yeroo meeqa dura fakkaata ture.
They want a situation.	Haala barbaadu.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun akkas miti.
I looked at my father.	Abbaa koo ilaale.
He could make himself do this.	Kana akka godhu of gochuu danda'a ture.
They are not who we are.	Isaan eenyu akka taane miti.
He glanced at me again.	Ammas ija natti ilaale.
You're in here.	Ati as keessa jirta.
He was no longer human.	Kana booda nama hin turre.
This is very misleading at best.	Kun yoo gaarii ta’e baay’ee dogoggora.
It took a whole year!.	Waggaa guutuu fudhate!.
She was very nice about it.	Isheen waa'ee kanaa baay'ee namatti tola turte.
I could have said more.	Silaa kana caalaa dubbachuu danda'a ture.
He gave us everything we had.	Waan qabnu hunda nuuf kenne.
We shouldn’t say.	Jechuu hin qabnu.
It just does that.	Akkas qofa godha.
He has a good job.	Hojii gaarii qaba.
I know my duty.	Dirqama koo nan beeka.
What to do with it?	Maal gochuuf?
It wasn’t anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin turre.
I have time to think about it.	Yeroon itti yaadu qaba.
But that’s not the case in reality.	Garuu dhugaa jiru keessatti akkas hin ta’u.
That’s a well-known issue.	Sun dhimma beekamaadha.
No one could do anything.	Namni homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
He got that absolutely right.	Sana guutummaatti sirriitti argate.
All that stuff just goes up, up, up.	Wanti sun hundi ol, ol, ol qofa deema.
But she did not stay with him for long.	Isheen garuu yeroo dheeraaf isa bira hin turre.
But man is not right about everything.	Namni garuu waan hundumaa irratti sirrii hin jiru.
Never mind that she .	Gonkumaa akka isheen .
This was not easy.	Kun salphaa hin turre.
He seems like a really nice, nice, person.	Dhuguma nama gaarii, gaarii, fakkaata.
I will always be yours.	Ani yoomiyyuu kan kee ta'a.
You don’t do it for me.	Ati naaf hin gootu.
I don't want money.	Maallaqa hin barbaadu.
He was there that day.	Guyyaa sana achi ture.
Must.	Dirqama.
Everything is right.	Wanti hundi sirrii dha.
He had had enough.	Inni gahaa ta'ee ture.
I know what he wants.	Waan inni barbaadu nan beeka.
Clearly, he was a man.	Nama akka ture ifaadha.
But I doubt it.	Ani garuu nan shakka.
I think they will love it.	Ni jaallatu jedheen yaada.
No one told her what to do or where she was.	Namni maal akka gootu fi eessa akka jirtu itti hime hin turre.
Now he was no longer a boy.	Amma kana booda gurbaa hin turre.
It seems like a mistake.	Dogoggora fakkaata.
How does it matter.	Akkamitti homaa hin qabu.
It was a lot, maybe too much.	Baay'ee ture, tarii baay'ee ture.
Maybe even her father.	Tarii abbaa ishee illee ta'a.
I will never tell anyone.	Yoomiyyuu namatti hin himu.
That's nothing.	Sun homaa miti.
They all knew it.	Hundi isaanii ni beeku turan.
It can’t be him.	Isa ta’uu hin danda’u.
He knew exactly what she had done.	Waan isheen goote sirriitti beeka ture.
I don't understand what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e naaf hin galle.
I'm not too sure about that and.	Ani waa'ee sanaa garmalee mirkanaa'aa mitii fi.
You need someone .	Nama si barbaachisa .
Not old, not new.	Kan durii miti, kan haaraa miti.
He’s good, but not this good.	Inni gaarii dha, garuu gaarii kana miti.
This is, perhaps, obvious.	Kun, tarii, ifaadha.
But it wasn’t easy.	Garuu salphaa hin turre.
Can anyone help please?.	Namni gargaaru jiraa maaloo?.
She's one.	Isheen tokko.
So	Kanaaf
They were good kids.	Ijoollee gaarii turan.
That he then needed someone with a sense of humor.	Sana booda nama miira qoosaa qabu akka isa barbaachisu.
I don’t have time to do this now.	Amma kana gochuuf yeroo hin qabu.
Still.	Ammas.
In this way, she said.	Haala kanaan jette.
Now I can be my authentic self.	Amma ofii koo isa dhugaa ta'uu nan danda'a.
He may be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I don’t go to school.	Ani mana barumsaa hin deemu.
This is not new there.	Kun achitti haaraa miti.
But it doesn't always happen.	Garuu yeroo hunda hin ta'u.
They are more like us.	Isaan caalaatti nu fakkaatu.
I began to speak.	Anis dubbachuu jalqabe.
You almost have it.	Qabdu jechuun ni danda'ama.
But she has feelings.	Garuu miira qabdi.
It’s not my place.	Bakka koo miti.
I had said, 'It's not.	jedheen ture.
She had a good feel for this one.	Isa kanaaf miira gaarii qabdi turte.
The two are not the same.	Lamaan isaanii wal hin fakkaatu.
A lot of things happened.	Waan baay'een ta'e.
Nothing else matters to him.	Wanti biraa isaaf dhimma hin qabu.
To do otherwise is not entirely appropriate.	Kanaan ala gochuun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
You need to know this.	Kana beekuu qabda.
Look at this picture.	Suuraa kana ilaalaa.
I know exactly what he means.	Maal jechuu isaa sirriitti beeka.
So another week went by.	Kanaaf torban biraa darbe.
It can be really bad.	Dhuguma hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
Which is happening a lot.	Kan baay'ee ta'aa jiru.
Probably not a good idea.	Tarii yaada gaarii miti.
Last year it was nothing.	Bara darbe homaa hin turre.
We have a good job.	Hojii gaarii qabna.
But it's nothing.	Garuu homaa miti.
There was nothing else he could do.	Wanti inni gochuu danda'u biraa hin turre.
So he could have not known better.	Kanaaf kana caalaa hin beekne ta'uu danda'a ture.
But they need money.	Garuu qarshii isaan barbaachisa.
She was very good.	Baayyee gaarii turte.
Not with a girl.	Intala waliin miti.
Now she was sure.	Amma mirkanaa'aa turte.
All of that may have to happen.	Sun hundi taʼuu qaba taʼa.
It’s not true though.	Dhugaa miti garuu.
I said it wasn't bad.	Hamaa miti jedheen.
We need all the help we can get.	Gargaarsa argachuu dandeenyu hunda nu barbaachisa.
But this never happened.	Garuu kun gonkumaa hin taane.
Sometimes it was bad.	Yeroo tokko tokko hamaa ture.
But I have been watching.	Ani garuu ilaalaa tureera.
It was a good feeling.	Miira gaarii ture.
Again, it's probably local.	Ammas kan naannoo ta'uu hin oolu.
This is probably what you are looking for.	Kun tarii waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu hin oolu.
No one knew much about it.	Waa'ee kanaa namni waan baay'ee beeku hin turre.
I've been there.	Ani tureera.
He went out with it.	Waliin ba'e.
I haven't seen any.	Ani tokkollee hin argine.
They look great, they feel great.	Isaan guddaa fakkaatu, miira guddaa qabu.
I like that.	Kana natti tola.
What works on one doesn’t always work on another.	Wanti tokko irratti hojjetu yeroo hunda kan biraa irratti hin hojjetu.
I just saw it now.	Amma qofa arge.
I can never do it.	Ani gonkumaa hin danda'u.
All of this, of course, was true.	Kun hundi, dhugaa akka ture beekamaadha.
But even this may not be enough.	Garuu kun illee gahaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
He was waiting for you.	Si eegaa ture.
Where were we when.	Eessa turre yoom.
No one is at the door.	Namni balbala bira hin jiru.
Maybe you don't think about them.	Tarii waa'ee isaanii hin yaaddu ta'a.
I think people like to be right.	Namoonni sirrii ta'uu ni jaallatu jedheen yaada.
That can never be enough.	Sun gonkumaa gahaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
Not with me on it, by itself.	Irratti na waliin miti, ofuma isaatiin.
We couldn’t have said it better ourselves.	Ofii keenya kana caalaa jechuu hin dandeenyu ture.
You have to get it from them.	Isaan irraa argachuu qabda.
Probably the easiest way.	Karaa salphaa ta'uu hin oolu.
Now things are different.	Amma wanti jiru adda.
A while passed.	Yeroon tokko darbe.
And the language.	Ani kan.
That you are the one.	Akka ati kan taate.
She was a teacher.	Barsiisaa turte.
Good ideas.	Yaada gaarii.
It's going to be really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'uuf deema.
He didn't have it.	Hin qabu ture.
But you don't know.	Garuu hin beektu.
Not yours, not mine, hers.	Kan kee miti, kan koo miti, kan ishee.
You have a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee qabda.
It may help to some extent.	Hamma tokko gargaaruu dandaʼa.
I have a lot to tell you.	Waan baay'ee sitti himuu qaba.
After a while they will leave.	Yeroo muraasa booda ni deemu.
We should all stay together tonight.	Halkan kana hundi keenya waliin turuu qabna.
Her room, where so much happened.	Kutaa ishee, bakka waan baay'een itti ta'e.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
Maybe this is both of us.	Tarii kun lamaan keenyayyuu ta'uu danda'a.
You said that.	Ati akkas jette.
Like inside, old.	Akkuma keessa, durii.
It's almost like home.	Akka manaatti jechuun ni danda'ama.
It wasn’t my business.	Dhimma koo hin turre.
As it was.	Akkuma ture.
So far with no luck.	Hanga ammaatti carraa tokko malee.
Let's look at it now.	Mee amma ilaalaa.
Time has passed.	Yeroon darbe.
It's unclear what happened next.	Kana booda maaltu akka ta'e ifa miti.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Kun akka hin taane ifaadha.
You were you.	Ati ati turte.
That didn’t seem right.	Sun sirrii hin fakkaatu ture.
I have my answer.	Deebii koo qaba.
In the clothes.	Uffata keessa.
I had no feelings whatsoever.	Miira tokkollee hin qabu ture.
But not my mother.	Garuu haadha koo miti.
I don't have to do anything.	Ani waan tokko gochuu hin qabu.
We need to go further.	Caalaatti deemuu qabna.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
I'm saying that.	Ani akkas jedha.
He would have had it.	Silaa qaba ture.
But they knew it.	Garuu ni beeku turan.
Place, place, place.	Bakka, bakka, bakka.
We were there.	Achi turre.
That's the most important reason.	Sababni hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma.
He knows me.	Inni na beeka.
He had a chance.	Carraa qaba ture.
Tell you what, it’s not.	Maal sitti himi, akkas miti.
But I am happy.	Ani garuu gammadeera.
But there was nothing there.	Garuu achitti homaa hin turre.
Way...	Karaa...
That would be a pretty big deal.	Sun waan baayyee guddaa ta'a.
This, however, is not entirely true.	Kun garuu guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
I don’t want that anymore.	Kana booda akkas hin barbaadu.
I told him there was no way.	Karaa hin qabu jedheen itti hime.
He was just a little bit.	Inni xiqqoo qofa ture.
This one was no exception.	Inni kun kanaan ala hin turre.
He had nothing to say.	Waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
But she said nothing.	Isheen garuu homaa hin dubbanne.
Not interested in me.	Naaf fedhii hin qabne.
No need for children.	Ijoollee hin barbaachifne.
But it's not too bad.	Garuu baayyee hamaa miti.
They are all the same.	Hundi isaanii tokko.
It’s a mistake.	Dogoggora dha.
He was there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti achi ture.
I mean, everybody loves him.	Namni hundi isa jaallata jechuu kooti.
It wasn’t, though.	Hin turre malee.
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
But I had no idea why this was happening.	Garuu kun maaliif akka ta’e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Everything he was going to do had to happen quickly.	Waan hojjechuuf deemu hunda dafee ta'uu qaba ture.
He is absolutely right.	Inni guutummaatti sirrii dha.
It wasn’t always easy.	Yeroo hundumaa salphaa hin turre.
That is not true.	Sun dhugaa miti.
But there was really nothing for it.	Garuu dhuguma wanti isaaf ta'u hin turre.
I like it that way.	Akkasitti natti tola.
It’s not a mistake.	Dogoggora miti.
I can't tell you that, of course.	Ani akkas sitti himuu hin danda'u, beekamaadha.
We can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
I knew exactly.	Ani sirriitti beeka ture.
You know these people.	Namoota kana ni beektu.
She was so right.	Isheen akka malee sirrii turte.
He's doing his best.	Waan danda'u hunda hojjechaa jira.
But something, maybe.	Garuu waan tokko, tarii.
I was in them.	Ani isaan keessa ture.
It seemed easy.	Salphaa fakkaata ture.
You don’t want to tell me, you don’t have to.	Natti himuu hin barbaaddu, dirqama miti.
What was that about? 	Sun maal ture?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I love them so much.	Baay'een isaan jaalladha.
You don't want any of this to happen.	Kana keessaa tokkollee akka ta'u hin barbaaddu.
Just a place to stay.	Bakka turuu qofa.
Who knew he had one.	Tokko akka qabu eenyutu beeka.
I'm sorry to say that.	Akkas jechuu kootti dhiifama.
She had to tell what she knew.	Waan beektu himuu qabdi turte.
He had little money.	Maallaqa xiqqoo qaba ture.
It was her book.	Kitaaba ishee ture.
Someone like you.	Nama akka kee.
In this day and age, people know.	Bara kana keessa namoonni ni beeku.
But without him .	Garuu isa malee .
This was bad, but not the worst.	Kun hamaa ture, garuu isa hamaa hin turre.
She was often alone.	Yeroo baayʼee kophaa ishee turte.
What is happening is happening.	Wanti ta'aa jiru ta'aa jira.
He wasn’t real.	Inni dhugaa hin turre.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
I would love nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin jaalladhu ture.
Indeed, there is.	Dhuguma, ni jira.
And he will do it again.	Ammas ni godha.
But I love it.	Ani garuu nan jaalladha.
We all had jobs.	Hundi keenya hojii qabna turre.
He lives alone.	Kophaa isaa jiraata.
That's what he says.	Wanti inni jedhu akkas.
I know you were.	Akka turte nan beeka.
But there is no one.	Garuu namni hin jiru.
I will definitely do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuun koo hin oolu.
Keep your eyes open.	Ija keessan eegaa.
I'm the one.	Ani isa.
Good old days indeed.	Dhuguma guyyaa gaarii durii.
He's looking at you.	Si ilaalaa jira.
I know you were doing a job.	Hojii tokko hojjechaa akka turte nan beeka.
She is no more.	Isheen kana caalaa hin jirtu.
He still didn’t want her to leave.	Ammas akka isheen deemtu hin barbaanne.
Now that’s not terribly true.	Amma sun akka malee dhugaa miti.
Why are they.	Maaliif isaan...
How does it go.	Akkamitti deema.
What is really going on.	Dhuguma maaltu jiraa.
None of it seems to work.	Tokkollee waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
Now is not the time to talk about it.	Yeroon ammaa waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu miti.
I couldn't do it either.	Anis gochuu hin dandeenye.
I know how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka.
You are the one.	Ati isa tokko.
We didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e nuti hin beekne.
But you know better.	Ati garuu caalaatti beekta.
It was something.	Waan tokko ture.
He usually napped in the afternoon	Yeroo baayʼee waaree booda ni hirriba ture
I didn’t know those people.	Namoota sana hin beeku ture.
We can’t know.	Beekuu hin dandeenyu.
But not everyone would go.	Namni hundi garuu hin deemu ture.
I don't know what that is, exactly.	Sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku, sirriitti.
She, who was	Isheen, kan turte
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
It should be soon though.	Dafee ta'uu qaba garuu.
I have to know.	Ani beekuu qaba.
They were really into it.	Dhuguma keessa turan.
That's probably not the case.	Akkas ta'uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
He is in school.	Mana barumsaa jira.
You should never hesitate to ask for help.	Gargaarsa gaafachuu irraa gonkumaa duubatti jechuu hin qabdu.
A few hours later he went again.	Sa'aatii muraasa booda ammas deeme.
That could not have happened.	Silaa sun taʼuu hin dandaʼu ture.
They are there, looking for us.	Isaan achi jiru, nu barbaadaa jiru.
I have no other answer for you.	Deebii biraa siif hin qabu.
Time has passed.	Yeroon darbe.
You have to see that.	Sana arguu qabda.
Everything seemed fine.	Hundi waan gaarii fakkaata ture.
If it works.	Yoo hojjete.
No one knows when.	Yoom kan beeku hin jiru.
Any comments, questions?.	Yaada, gaaffii qabduu?.
But she could see nothing.	Isheen garuu homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
He had to come.	Inni akka dhufu qaba ture.
She wouldn’t go without it.	Isheen malee hin deemtu turte.
No one thinks you are good enough.	Namni ati gaarii sitti hin fakkaatu.
It’s not necessarily new.	Dirqama waan haaraa miti.
No one can tell him what to do.	Namni maal akka godhu itti himuu hin danda'u.
I knew your name.	Maqaa kee beeka ture.
Tell me why.	Maaliif akka ta'e natti himi.
He is there.	Inni achi jira.
This is not entirely true.	Kun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
I'm pretty sure she's not.	Isheen akka hin taane mirkanaa'aa dha.
Turre.	Turre.
He didn't do that.	Akkas hin goone.
He looked at them quickly.	Dafee isaan ilaale.
It looked very long.	Baayyee dheeraa fakkaata ture.
There’s just nothing.	Homaa hin jiru qofa.
But he was the man he is today.	Garuu nama har'a jiru sana ture.
He knew it wouldn't last long.	Yeroo dheeraa akka hin turre ni beeka ture.
I don't want to go back.	Deebi'uu hin barbaadu.
Everything he does.	Waan godhu hunda.
But there is nothing more.	Garuu kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
He got out of there.	Achi keessaa ba'e.
Do you know what's going on for me?	Waan ta'aa jiru naaf beektaa?
We can’t stay here.	As turuu hin dandeenyu.
Not that my career should have been better than it was.	Hojiin koo silaa waan ture caalaa ta'uu qaba ture jechuu miti.
Now, of course, you definitely don't want to be anything at the time.	Amma, beekamaadha, yeroo sanatti homaa ta'uu akka hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
This will work.	Kun ni hojjeta.
It shouldn't have been like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
Only a few.	Muraasa qofa.
But it is a new fact of course.	Garuu dhugaa haaraa beekamaadha.
You are very nice.	Ati baay'ee namatti tola.
It seemed like he had been gone for a very long time.	Baayyee yeroo dheeraaf waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
We were different.	Nuti adda turre.
In my room.	Kutaa koo keessatti.
This was no longer true.	Kun kana booda dhugaa hin turre.
I thought no one around me knew.	Namni naannoo koo jiru tokkollee waan hin beekne natti fakkaate.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
It was really there.	Dhuguma achi ture.
It's too good to be true.	Garmalee gaarii dha.
They are a disaster waiting to happen.	Balaa ta'uuf eegaa jiru.
I'm trying to.	Ani yaalaa jira.
You don't know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beektu.
I don’t need anything else.	Waan biraa na hin barbaachisu.
Seems.	Fakkaata.
There is nothing else in it.	Wanti biraa keessa hin jiru.
He’s just there.	Inni achi qofa jira.
He was now fully human.	Inni amma guutummaatti nama ture.
I knew how it was.	Akkamitti akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
I really didn’t want to go.	Dhuguma deemuu hin barbaanne.
He was a bad man.	Nama hamaa ture.
As he was waiting for us.	Akkuma inni nu eegaa ture.
I saw none of this in his book.	Kitaaba isaa keessatti waa'ee kanaa tokkollee hin argine.
But it wasn’t just her favorite place.	Garuu bakka isheen jaallattu qofa hin turre.
I don't want to talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
But he didn't say much.	Garuu waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
It was never too late.	Gonkumaa yeroon booda hin turre.
It wasn’t much help.	Gargaarsa guddaa hin turre.
I told him it was going well.	Akka gaariitti akka deemaa jiru itti hime.
It was inside.	Keessa ture.
Few of us can do without a car.	Konkolaataa malee hojjechuu kan dandeenyu muraasa keenya.
Two for you.	Lama siif.
You can do this.	Kana gochuu dandeessa.
Sometimes I think about that.	Yeroo tokko tokko sana nan yaada.
It wasn’t just my eyes that went.	Kan deeme ija koo qofa miti.
We have a lot of inside jokes.	Qoosaa keessaa baay'ee qabna.
You don’t know what’s out there.	Waan ala jiru hin beektu.
I would much rather do that.	Ani akkas gochuu baay'een naaf wayya.
She never got into it.	Isheen gonkumaa keessa hin galle.
They have to do that.	Sana gochuu qabu.
He seems to know little about the situation.	Waa'ee haala jiru waan xiqqoo beeku fakkaata.
I don't have the right answer.	Deebii sirrii hin qabu.
You can do better than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa.
She was very young.	Baayyee xiqqoo turte.
You have to be human.	Nama ta'uu qabda.
I wasn’t working with anyone.	Nama waliin hojjechaa hin turre.
We were just playing and just going.	Taphachuu qofa turre qofa deemaa turre.
This is really just my thoughts and feelings.	Kun dhuguma yaada fi miira koo qofa.
You can’t have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
He was going to do the work.	Hojii hojjechuuf ture.
But he was right.	Garuu inni sirrii ture.
He said he didn't think so.	Akkas hin yaadne jedhe.
Now, this was really great.	Amma, kun dhuguma waan guddaa ture.
And yet none of this happened.	Ammas garuu kun tokkollee hin taane.
So look at yourself.	Kanaaf of ilaalaa.
How many years.	Waggaa meeqa.
But he realized something.	Garuu waan tokko hubate.
He just had to think.	Yaadu qofa qaba ture.
I know it's going to happen.	Ta'uuf akka jiru nan beeka.
I had no problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoo hin qabu ture.
He could live with that.	Sana waliin jiraachuu danda'a ture.
You don't need much.	Waan baay'ee si hin barbaachisu.
They want to see it.	Arguu barbaadu.
There was no one else like her.	Namni biraa ishee fakkaatu hin turre.
It should be every door.	Balbala hunda ta'uu qaba.
We are still working.	Ammallee hojjechaa jirra.
This was the only time we saw him.	Yeroo kana qofa isa argine.
You can usually find what you are looking for in it.	Yeroo baayʼee wanta barbaaddu isa keessaa argachuu dandeessa.
He told me he had to go back to her.	Gara ishee deebi'uu akka qabu natti hime.
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu miti.
All of which were better than nothing.	Isaan kun hundi homaa hin taane caalaa gaarii turan.
But they knew better.	Isaan garuu kana caalaa beeku turan.
That's how the dog.	Akkasitti saree.
I was a human being.	Ani nama ture.
We are not qualified.	Ga'umsa hin qabnu.
All they need is food.	Wanti isaan barbaachisu nyaata qofa.
I'm really sorry about that.	Kanaaf dhuguma dhiifama.
All this right here.	Kun hundi sirriitti asitti.
They’re not the only ones though.	Isaan kana qofa miti garuu.
The timing was right!	Yeroon sirrii ture!
Sometimes we need money.	Yeroo tokko tokko qarshii nu barbaachisa.
Maybe now	Tarii amma .
Clearly, this is not the case here.	Kun asitti akka hin taane ifaadha.
Among.	Keessaa.
I had to do something about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan tokko gochuun qaba ture.
I'm not saying they have to be yours.	Kan keessan ta'uu qabu jechuu koo miti.
You can help.	Gargaaruu dandeessu.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
I told him that.	Akkas jedheen itti hime.
It only took a moment.	Yeroo muraasa qofa fudhate.
It was too good to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii ture.
The problem was, I didn’t know what to do.	Rakkoon ture, maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
You have to work on yourself.	Of irratti hojjechuu qabda.
He didn’t have a car.	Konkolaataa hin qabu ture.
His voice.	Sagalee isaa.
You knew me.	Ati na beekta turte.
I know better.	Ani caalaatti beeka.
It was late in the afternoon.	Yeroon isaa waaree booda ture.
There were a lot more people there than usual.	Namoonni yeroo biraa caalaa baay'ee achi turan.
But then he realized he had made a mistake.	Garuu sana booda dogoggora akka hojjete hubate.
Now I don't want it at all.	Amma tasumaa hin barbaadu.
You think it's good.	Gaarii sitti fakkaata.
I can't talk about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I think that was the right thing to do.	Wanti sun gochuun sirrii ture jedheen yaada.
I need it.	Na barbaachisa.
You know you want to!.	Akka barbaaddu beekta!.
All we have to do is work well together.	Wanti nuti gochuu qabnu akka gaariitti waliin hojjechuu qofa.
They were very emotional.	Isaan baay'ee miira keessa turan.
Sometimes good, sometimes bad.	Yeroo tokko tokko gaarii, yeroo tokko tokko hamaa.
He’s just one person.	Inni nama tokko qofa.
He’s not really like that, of course.	Inni dhuguma akkas miti, beekamaadha.
Maybe it's that bad joke.	Tarii qoosaa hamaa sana ta'uu danda'a.
She was very young.	Isheen baay'ee xiqqoo turte.
That is not the reality here.	Asitti dhugaa jiru sun miti.
That sounds perfectly fine.	Sun guutummaatti gaarii fakkaata.
We went.	Deemne.
It made him pretty good.	Baay'ee gaarii isa godhe.
He looked older.	Inni umuriin isaa guddaa fakkaata ture.
But there’s more to it than that.	Garuu kana caalaa jira.
No one is around to help us.	Namni nu gargaaru naannoo hin jiru.
But then he was there.	Garuu sana booda achi ture.
Life is not for you.	Jireenya siif miti.
You can’t have that.	Sana qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
He says he is not in any other trouble.	Rakkoo biraa keessa akka hin jirre dubbata.
He was there for three years.	Waggaa sadii achi ture.
It's not about me.	Waa'ee koo miti.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
He didn’t go to school.	Mana barumsaa hin deemne.
This is not about me and my desires.	Kun waa'ee koo fi fedhii koo miti.
I might be the one.	Ani ta'uu danda'a.
Just a great house.	Mana guddaa qofa.
Strangers rarely do.	Namoonni hin beekne yeroo muraasaaf ni godhu.
He would have known what was happening.	Silaa waan ta'aa jiru ni beeka ture.
He knew this was here, of course.	Kun as akka jiru beeka ture, beekamaadha.
This should work.	Kun hojjechuu qaba.
He is with us.	Inni nu waliin jira.
It's probably a good thing.	Waan gaarii ta'uu hin oolu.
But you’re not, boy.	Garuu ati miti gurbaa.
He would never say never.	Yoomiyyuu gonkumaa hin jedhu ture.
We must go to him.	Gara isaa deemuun dirqama.
I don’t know what else to do.	Maal biraa akkan godhu hin beeku.
Again, their time is up.	Ammas yeroon isaanii darbe.
He never said anything.	Inni gonkumaa homaa hin dubbanne.
This was a great opportunity.	Kun carraa guddaa ture.
On.	Irra.
. . . .	.
I used to have a lot of work to do.	Duraan hojiin baay'ee qaba ture.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
Clearly, the problem is twofold.	Rakkoon jiru waan lama akka ta’e ifaadha.
I really can't believe she's mine.	Dhuguma isheen kan koo ta'uu ishee amanuu hin danda'u.
But you know it's happening.	Garuu akka ta'aa jiru beekta.
But they know it.	Garuu ni beeku.
Still there was no sound.	Ammas sagalee tokkollee hin turre.
You would have had time.	Silaa yeroo qabda turte.
Maybe he was just waiting for someone.	Tarii nama tokko qofa eegaa ture ta'a.
They want something different.	Waan adda ta'e barbaadu.
What did you do? 	Maal goote?
He can't help it.	Inni gargaaruu hin danda'u.
So we have something in common.	Kanaaf waan wal fakkaatu qabna.
But none of them are enough.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee gahaa miti.
You have a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee qabda.
I would love that.	Ani sana nan jaalladha.
I can't believe it's me.	Ana ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u.
You know where you are, of course.	Bakka jirtu ni beekta, beekamaadha.
Money, money, money!	Maallaqa, qarshii, qarshii!
I really had no excuse.	Dhuguma sababa hin qabu ture.
It looked very different at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baayyee adda fakkaata ture.
It was good of him to even do that.	Sana illee gochuun isaa gaarii ture.
I'm looking for a little space.	Bakka xiqqoo barbaadaa jira.
It’s not where I want to be.	Bakka ani jiraachuu barbaadu miti.
They were a great time.	Yeroo guddaa turan.
That was before.	Sun kanaan dura ture.
Everything we’ve done.	Waan hojjenne hunda.
Who would ever want it after what he did.	Waan hojjete booda eenyutu yoomiyyuu barbaada.
That you want her more.	Caalaatti ishee akka barbaaddu.
It should work both ways.	Karaa lamaan hojjechuu qaba.
I don't know why that happened.	Maaliif akkas ta'e hin beeku.
I know it’s dangerous.	Balaa akka qabu nan beeka.
I always thought that was pretty cool.	Yeroo hundumaa sun baayʼee namatti tola jedheen yaada ture.
They can go.	Isaan deemuu danda'u.
He knew exactly what that little thing was.	Wanti xiqqoo sun maal akka taʼe sirriitti beeka ture.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
But now they were different.	Amma garuu adda turan.
He even told me that the day we met.	Guyyaa wal argine sana illee akkas natti hime.
No one else was there.	Namni biraa achi hin turre.
We need to ask him questions.	Gaaffii isa gaafachuu qabna.
That's not why, though.	Kanaaf miti garuu.
But you already know that.	Garuu sana duruu beekta.
It was a question.	Gaaffii ture.
He did it for me.	Naaf godhe.
He’s just not that important.	Inni hangas barbaachisaa miti qofa.
It could have been me.	Silaa ana ta'uu danda'a ture.
Always a little bit.	Yeroo hundumaa xiqqoo.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Garuu wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
Of course, that never happens.	Sun gonkumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
They really should have known better.	Dhuguma silaa kana caalaa beekuu qabu turan.
We can’t have him in our lives.	Jireenya keenya keessatti isa qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
I can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I don't know what to do.	Ani maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
That is not true.	Sun dhugaa miti.
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
Really nice, real guy.	Dhuguma namatti tola gurbaa dhugaa.
Such a great passion.	Fedhii guddaa akkasii.
I was watching one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko ilaalaa ture.
He is everywhere.	Inni bakka hunda jira.
Things used to be bad.	Duraan wanti hamaa ture.
Her chance was now.	Carraan ishee amma ture.
I could have screamed.	Iyyuu nan danda'a ture.
This wasn’t going to work.	Kun hojjechuuf hin turre.
He absolutely loves it.	Inni guutummaatti ni jaallata.
I want them both.	Isaan lamaan barbaada.
That was another year, another time.	Sun bara biraa, yeroo biraa ture.
We still don’t have to do this.	Ammallee kana gochuu hin qabnu.
She knew nothing.	Isheen homaa hin beektu turte.
Nothing we haven’t seen before.	Waan kanaan dura hin argine hin jiru.
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
I know several times in my career.	Hojii koo keessatti yeroo hedduu beeka.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
Which is not very likely.	Kan baayyee hin taane.
Maybe you're not.	Tarii ta'uu dhiisuu dandeessa.
When will they come?	Yoom dhufu?
I didn’t know what to tell him.	Waan itti himu hin beeku ture.
Too much time has passed.	Yeroon garmalee darbe.
Not again, either.	Ammas miti.
It wasn’t a chance.	Carraa hin turre.
I'm sure he's not beyond help.	Gargaarsa bira akka hin jirre mirkanaa'adha.
Not on one person.	Nama tokko irratti miti.
But this is not my opinion.	Garuu kun yaada koo miti.
A local man	Nama naannoo sanaa
It’s not that bad.	Hamma kana hamaa miti.
You don’t need to do anything more.	Kana caalaa homaa gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
This is nothing.	Kun homaa miti.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
If not, it's okay.	Yoo hin taane garuu homaa miti.
Neither of us could believe what we saw.	Lamaan keenyayyuu waan argine amanuu hin dandeenye.
I thought it was pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate.
Hope this helps!.	Kun akka gargaaru abdii qabna!.
Now there is one.	Amma tokko jira.
This is just our time.	Yeroon kun yeroo keenya qofa.
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
This rarely happens.	Kun yeroo muraasaaf ta’a.
Not my father.	Abbaa koo miti.
But she doesn’t like me.	Garuu isheen natti hin jaallattu.
But no one was around, it seemed.	Garuu namni naannoo sana jiru hin turre, waan fakkaata ture.
Sorry, I don’t know exactly where it is, but it’s out there.	Dhiifama, eessa akka jiru sirriitti hin beeku, garuu achi keessa jira.
I think it's a good idea.	Yaada gaarii natti fakkaata.
Everything inside me, everything outside me.	Waan keessa koo jiru hunda, waan na ala jiru hunda.
That’s how it works here.	Asitti akkasitti hojjeta.
We need to do this now.	Kana amma gochuu qabna.
I belong to my time.	Ani kan yeroo kooti.
I need the money.	Maallaqa na barbaachisa.
He will need someone to help him there.	Nama achitti isa gargaaru ni barbaada.
He really wanted this job.	Hojii kana baayʼee barbaada ture.
I don’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku.
You know that to be true.	Sana dhugaa ta'uuf beekta.
She wasn’t wrong.	Isheen dogoggora hin turre.
For him, it was his job.	Isaaf hojii isaa ture.
You can find another one.	Kan biraa argachuu dandeessa.
This is not true, however.	Kun garuu dhugaa miti.
That is not an easy task.	Sun hojii salphaa miti.
We have each other.	Wal qabna.
It wasn’t my idea.	Yaada koo hin turre.
I'm so, so sorry.	Ani akkas, baay'ee dhiifama.
But she said not to.	Garuu akka hin taane jette.
You’re doing what you need to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu hojjechaa jirta.
Now one thing.	Amma waan tokko.
With food.	Nyaata waliin.
It may still happen.	Ammas taʼuu dandaʼa.
Already, it’s always here.	Duruu, yeroo hundumaa as jira.
If that were true.	Osoo sun dhugaa ta'ee.
I really don’t know how to do this.	Dhuguma akkamitti akkan kana godhu hin beeku.
But it was really from.	Garuu dhuguma irraa ture.
A new year, a new life for us.	Bara haaraa, jireenya haaraa nuuf.
When that happens, your voice would work again.	Yeroo sun ta'u sagalee kee ammas ni hojjeta ture.
It's not a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa hin qabu.
There are three of us.	Nuti sadii dha.
It's probably his.	Kan inni ta'uu hin oolu.
But there was nothing you could do about it.	Garuu wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
It was all over it.	Hundi isaa irra ture.
Very, very good.	Baayyee baayyee gaarii dha.
It still wasn’t enough.	Ammas gahaa hin turre.
It was a very good book.	Kitaaba baayyee gaarii ture.
That he is not a good man.	Nama gaarii akka hin taane.
I haven’t seen any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin argine.
It is good if we go.	Yoo deemne gaarii dha.
It was my father’s mother’s name.	Maqaa haadha abbaa koo ture.
It is a very, very good book.	Kitaaba baayyee baayyee gaarii dha.
I have a matter.	Ani dhimma qaba.
I can tell.	Ani beekuu nan danda'a.
Again, he didn't do anything wrong.	Ammas waan hamaa hin hojjenne.
I like to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
Like, all of it.	Akka, hunda isaa.
Now it sits in the home area.	Amma naannoo manaa keessa taa'a.
It’s not always what seems obvious.	Yeroo hundumaa waan ifa fakkaatu miti.
He knew the place.	Bakka sana ni beeka ture.
Man cannot do everything.	Namni waan hunda gochuu hin danda'u.
He would have wanted me.	Silaa na barbaada ture.
Only the good ones.	Kan gaarii qofa.
She was not altruistic.	Isheen kan of kennuu hin turre.
Why not, he said.	Maaliif hin ta'u jedhe.
None of them knew what to do.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan godhu hin beeku ture.
I saw this one day.	Guyyaa tokko kana arge.
Now there is something there.	Amma wanti tokko achi jira.
Everything in the past was.	Wanti darbe hundi ture.
It's more than you want to know.	Kan ati beekuu barbaaddu caalaa ta'a.
He said they would.	Ni godhu jedhe.
This wasn't about his imagination.	Kun waa'ee yaada isaa hin turre.
That was nothing.	Sun homaa ture.
He asks if you can have time for him today.	Har'a yeroo isaaf qabaachuu dandeessaa jedhee gaafate.
She wasn’t like that.	Isheen akkas hin turre.
They’ll do you a favor out there.	Isaan achi keessaa waan gaarii siif hojjetu.
I really don’t want to.	Dhuguma hin barbaadu.
They are no exception.	Isaan kun kanaan ala miti.
I'm not so sure.	Ani akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
This is now.	Kun amma.
But that was only once.	Yeroon sun garuu yeroo tokko qofa ture.
In my mouth.	Afaan koo keessaa.
Now things are different.	Amma wanti adda ta'e.
I can be a real person.	Ani nama dhugaa ta'uu nan danda'a.
I mean, you can stay with me.	Na bira turuu dandeessu jechuu kooti.
It started out well.	Akka gaariitti jalqabe.
On the life of the.	Jireenya irratti.
That’s not so obvious.	Sun akkas ifa miti.
They like that.	Isaan akkas ni jaallatu.
It’s not my thing.	Waan koo miti.
No one was home.	Namni mana ture hin jiru.
I don’t always want to do this.	Yeroo hunda kana gochuu hin barbaadu.
Everything he needs.	Waan isa barbaachisu hunda.
This can be a problem.	Kun rakkoo ta’uu danda’a.
Not his mother.	Haadha isaa miti.
It was just in hers.	Kan ishee keessa qofa ture.
It’s not something new.	Waan haaraa miti.
I don't have much longer.	Kana caalaa yeroo dheeraa hin qabu.
I didn’t realize the time went by so quickly.	Yeroon akkas dafee akka darbe hin hubanne.
This just can't be right.	Kun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
I told him what I thought.	Anis yaada koo itti hime.
You knew your way around.	Karaa kee naannoo kee beekta turte.
I don't want to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin barbaadu.
It can’t be anything else.	Waan biraa ta’uu hin danda’u.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
I have a problem with that idea.	Yaada sana irratti rakkoon qaba.
Maybe it was nothing.	Tarii homaa hin turre ta'a.
He wasn’t in place to do anything.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf bakka isaa hin turre.
It will eat you up.	Si nyaata.
That’s not your job.	Sun hojii kee miti.
He was important.	Inni barbaachisaa ture.
She was in there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi keessa turte.
They need a lot of help.	Gargaarsa guddaa isaan barbaachisa.
Among.	Keessaa.
It’s not something like that.	Waan akkasii miti.
He was doing a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjechaa ture.
She was always right.	Yeroo hundumaa sirrii turte.
But she couldn't.	Isheen garuu hin dandeenye.
What shouldn’t you do?	Maal gochuu hin qabdu?
She is very	Isheen baayyee .
He said he was well aware of that fact.	Dhugaa sana sirriitti akka beeku dubbateera.
That's not what's important.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma miti.
I'm not good enough.	Ani gaarii miti.
She's one.	Isheen tokko.
They didn’t do each other any good.	Gaarii tokkollee wal hin hojjenne.
You were there, too.	Ati illee turte.
It couldn't be, he told himself.	Ta'uu hin danda'u jedhee ofitti hime.
He no longer spoke to me but to himself.	Kana booda ofitti malee natti hin dubbanne.
They really were nothing.	Dhuguma isaan homaa hin turre.
He gave it a hand.	Harka itti kenne.
I can't tell.	Himuu hin danda'u.
It never looks the same.	Gonkumaa wal fakkaata hin fakkaatu.
There is nothing else.	Waan biraa hin jiru.
It shouldn't be here.	As ta'uu hin qabu.
I'm not sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti.
I could never afford books.	Kitaaba bitachuu gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
I can't do any more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin danda'u.
That is not true!	Sun dhugaa miti!
I know these people.	Namoota kana nan beeka.
It can be on your hands for sure.	Harka kee irratti mirkanaa'aa ta'uu danda'a.
It's possible.	Ni danda'ama.
Good! 	Gaarii!
Someone who looks like him.	Nama isa fakkaatu.
It was a lot of situations.	Haala baay'ee ture.
There’s no other time you can get that.	Yeroon biraa itti sana argachuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I just saw that issue.	Dhimma sana amma arge.
This is the worst possible answer to this question.	Gaaffii kanaaf deebii hamaa ta'e kana.
Something wasn’t right.	Waan tokko sirrii hin turre.
But he knew who she was.	Garuu eenyu akka taate beeka ture.
But this is nothing new.	Kun garuu waan haaraa miti.
It’s really dangerous up there.	Dhuguma achi ol balaa qaba.
He met his teacher yesterday.	Kaleessa barsiisaa isaa waliin wal arge.
If it were a mistake.	Osoo dogoggora ta'ee.
You know this, you know.	Kana ni beektu.
Maybe it's a good thing.	Tarii waan gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
But it is not the same.	Garuu tokko miti.
This was not one.	Kun tokko hin turre.
Now, a lot of it.	Amma, baay'ee.
Many people are drinking too much.	Namoonni baay'een garmalee dhugaa jiru.
It must be you.	Si ta'uu qaba.
You're right.	Sirrii qabda.
That's not going to happen.	Sun hin ta'u.
It just doesn’t work.	Qofa hin hojjetu.
That’s one thing.	Sun waan tokko.
There's nothing more he can do here.	Kana caalaa wanti inni asitti gochuu danda'u hin jiru.
I think it went well.	Akka gaariitti deeme natti fakkaata.
This is all my opinion.	Kun hundi yaada kooti.
I really want to see her.	Ishee arguu baay'een barbaada.
Can't leave her up there on her own.	Achi ol ofii ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u.
I like it very much.	Baay'ee natti tola.
You have a new opportunity here.	Carraa haaraa asitti qabda.
They love each other.	Wal jaallatu.
I really didn’t know what to say.	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture.
While she .	Osoo isheen .
But what about this.	Garuu kanaaf maal.
That’s not necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa miti.
You had it.	Ati qabda turte.
He wanted her to leave.	Isheen akka deemtu barbaade.
There is no tomorrow here.	Asitti boru hin jiru.
I want to go back.	Deebi'uu barbaada.
So you don’t do it.	Kanaaf hin gootu.
It would be too easy.	Garmalee salphaa ta'a.
I love that sound.	Sagalee sana nan jaalladha.
I knew it was her.	Ishee akka taate nan beeka ture.
Not very good.	Baayyee gaarii miti.
He is still right.	Inni ammas sirrii dha.
There was no one else here.	Asitti namni biraa hin turre.
They say try to work together.	Waliin hojjechuuf yaalaa jedhu.
Not many friends.	Hiriyyoota baay'ee miti.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
That might work.	Sun hojjechuu danda'a.
I didn't know where.	Eessa akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
Too much here.	Asitti garmalee.
They want him, with everything he’s seen.	Isaan isa barbaadu, waan inni arge hundumaa wajjin.
You are with her.	Ati ishee waliin jirta.
He didn't speak anymore.	Kana booda hin dubbanne.
With all this.	Kana hunda waliin.
Things you don’t understand.	Wantoota siif hin galle.
It probably would have been.	Silaa ta'uu hin oolu.
That's what he said.	Kana jedhee ture.
We all have something in common.	Hundi keenya waan wal fakkaatu qabna.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
Look at each other.	Wal ilaalaa.
You know you have it.	Akka qabdu ni beekta.
He’s not in it just yet.	Inni amma qofa keessa hin jiru.
This isn't about that.	Kun waa'ee sanaa miti.
He probably wouldn’t have liked it.	Inni tarii hin jaallatu ture.
There had to be something he could do.	Wanti inni gochuu dandaʼu jiraachuu qaba ture.
That was all he said.	Dubbate kana qofa ture.
He should have plenty of time.	Yeroo hedduu qabaachuu qaba.
But we’re still around.	Garuu ammallee naannoo jirra.
You would have never let me go alone.	Silaa gonkumaa kophaa koo akkan deemu na gootu turte.
It’s not entirely clear what happened here.	Asitti maaltu akka ta’e guutummaatti ifa miti.
I'm going to leave.	Ani deemuuf jedha.
This was his chance.	Kun carraa isaa ture.
I knew that.	Beeka ture kan.
He has another chance.	Carraa biraa qaba.
They had the same idea.	Yaada tokko qaban turan.
We did that.	Nuti akkas goone.
But it didn’t look that bad.	Garuu hangas hamaa hin fakkaatu ture.
He realized that he could not help him here.	Asitti isa gargaaruu akka hin dandeenye hubate.
Really, really great.	Dhuguma, dhuguma guddaa.
Can you tell me the time, please?	Yeroo isaa natti himuu dandeessaa maaloo?
I don’t know what he’s doing.	Waan inni hojjetu hin beeku.
Someone had to help her.	Namni tokko ishee gargaaruu qaba ture.
Please just wait for me.	Mee naaf eegaa qofa.
A little more optimistic.	Xiqqoo abdii guddaa qaba.
Nothing happened for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa hin taane.
I was really very happy.	Dhuguma baay'een gammade.
Not yet though.	Ammallee miti garuu.
He seems to be waiting for someone.	Nama waan eegaa jiru fakkaata.
But we need to go further.	Garuu kana caalaa deemuu qabna.
He still has his voice.	Ammas sagalee isaa qaba.
But that’s not true.	Garuu sun dhugaa miti.
These obviously no longer exist.	Isaan kun kana booda akka hin jirre ifaadha.
She doesn't care.	Dhimma hin qabdu.
He was one with everything, absolutely.	Inni waan hundumaa wajjin tokko ture, guutummaatti.
You hope it happens.	Akka ta'u abdii qabda.
In Him.	Isa keessatti.
He could have had anything he wanted to eat.	Silaa waan nyaachuu barbaade qabaachuu danda'a ture.
He must have wanted you to know.	Akka ati beektu barbaade taʼuu qaba.
They don’t have kids, just each other.	Ijoollee hin qaban, wal qofa.
You are not a non-human.	Ati nama hin taane miti.
It may be too much time though.	Yeroo garmalee ta'uu danda'a garuu.
It is none other than me.	Ani malee kan biraa miti.
He knew it was too easy.	Garmalee salphaa akka ture ni beeka ture.
Not much was happening after that.	Sana booda waan baay'ee ta'aa hin turre.
It looked good on her.	Ishee irratti gaarii fakkaata ture.
Which we can see.	Kan arguu dandeenyu.
Have.	Qaba.
It doesn't seem to do anything.	Homaa waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
It was a joke.	Qoosaa ture.
He no longer looked completely human.	Kana booda guutummaatti nama hin fakkaatu ture.
It’s really not that important.	Dhuguma hangas barbaachisaa miti.
Check out this book.	Kitaaba kana ilaalaa.
But it can't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin danda'u.
He didn't want to.	Hin barbaanne.
It used to be much easier.	Duraan baayyee salphaa ture.
It’s not easy.	Salphaa miti.
Maybe I don't know what it is.	Tarii maal akka ta'e hin beeku ta'a.
It shouldn't stay.	Turuu hin qabu.
There, but not there.	Achitti malee achi miti.
I thought she was onto me.	Isheen na irra jirtu natti fakkaate.
I would like that.	Ani akkas nan barbaada.
It’s really good.	Dhuguma gaarii dha.
You are new to this.	Kana irratti haaraa taate.
It’s just her job.	Hojii ishee qofa.
We need ideas.	Yaada nu barbaachisa.
But nobody did it.	Garuu namni godhe hin jiru.
they had a smile.	qaban turan.
But he can't.	Garuu hin danda'u.
That was for sure.	Sun mirkanaa'aa ture.
Good job!	Hojii gaarii!
But he was always lucky.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa carraa qaba ture.
Everything was fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ture.
No one else can know your work.	Hojii kee namni biraa beekuu hin danda'u.
We couldn’t have done it without them.	Silaa isaan malee gochuu hin dandeenyu ture.
It was a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ture.
This was all they needed.	Kun waan isaan barbaachisu qofa ture.
She would have done nothing like that.	Silaa homaa akkasii hin gootu turte.
They do something a little different.	Waan xiqqoo adda ta'e hojjetu.
You know where you want to go.	Bakka deemuuf barbaaddu ni beekta.
I'm sorry it had to be you.	Dhiifama si ta'uu qaba ture.
Their dog and themselves.	Saree isaanii fi ofii isaanii.
How much does it work.	Meeqa hojjeta.
But maybe you're right.	Garuu tarii sirrii ta'uu dandeessa.
He said we wouldn't do that.	Akkas hin goonu jedhe.
I knew it then.	Yeroo sanatti nan beeka ture.
He had been there.	Inni achi turee ture.
He didn't know how he knew.	Akkamitti akka beeku hin beeku ture.
She did not have to know why.	Maaliif akka taʼe beekuu hin qabdu turte.
I thought it was a great day.	Guyyaa guddaa natti fakkaate.
said.	jedhe.
He wouldn't have needed to do that.	Silaa akkas gochuun isa hin barbaachisu ture.
We have to be going now.	Amma deemaa jiraachuu qabna.
This isn't just about me.	Kun waa'ee koo qofa miti.
Then he asked me to leave.	Sana booda akkan deemu na gaafate.
You're not that bad.	Ati akkas hamaa miti.
I can't be the only person here.	Asitti nama qofa ta'uu hin danda'u.
You don’t have to work for him.	Isaaf hojjechuu hin qabdu.
But it’s there.	Garuu achi jira.
And' on.	Ani' kan.
She couldn’t find her car.	Konkolaataa ishee argachuu hin dandeenye.
She is only three years old.	Umuriin ishee waggaa sadii qofa.
So that rules him out.	Kanaaf sun isa ala godha.
He says you’re not here, you don’t know where you are.	Ati as hin jirtu, bakka jirtu hin beektu jedha.
Just stay in your room.	Kutaa keessan keessa turuu qofa.
He didn’t seem happy.	Inni waan gammade hin fakkaatu ture.
But it wasn’t one like this.	Garuu akkasitti tokko hin turre.
It’s not clear why he thinks that.	Maaliif akkas akka yaadu ifa miti.
They don’t have it.	Isaan hin qaban.
But none of that was true.	Garuu sun tokkollee dhugaa hin turre.
Maybe it shouldn't be money.	Tarii maallaqa ta'uu hin qabu ta'a.
No one is going to make you leave.	Namni akka deemtu si godhu hin jiru.
Lots of ideas!	Yaada baay'ee!
But another time.	Garuu yeroo biraa.
Now my question.	Amma gaaffii koo.
Not in his time.	Yeroo isaatti miti.
I am very happy now.	Amma baay'een gammadeera.
That was the best.	Sun hunda caalaa ture.
I was home all day.	Guyyaa guutuu mana ture.
This was not easy.	Kun salphaa hin turre.
He says of course you can.	Inni akkas jedha beekamaadha ni dandeessa.
None of them can.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin danda'u.
In this way, please.	Haala kanaan maaloo.
She isn’t like that.	Isheen akkas miti.
Look at the location.	Bakka jiru ilaalaa.
She didn't say anything.	Isheen homaa hin dubbanne.
These were his things.	Kun wantoota isaa turan.
Someone he is like that.	Nama inni akkas ta'e.
It's very large.	Baayyee guddaa dha.
I don't know his name.	Maqaa isaa hin beeku.
It was really what it was like.	Dhuguma maal akka fakkaatu ture.
He was doing a lot of that.	Inni baay'ee sana hojjechaa ture.
The problem was in fact in the right.	Rakkoon jiru dhugaa irratti sirrii keessa ture.
Not a girl.	Intala miti.
If only he didn't want her so.	Osoo akkas ishee hin barbaanne ta'ee.
He knows who he is.	Eenyu akka ta'e ni beeka.
Can anyone , please?	Namni danda'u jiraa , maaloo?
They knew their people.	Namoota isaanii ni beeku turan.
I thought someone needed to go to him.	Namni tokko gara isaa deemuun barbaachisaa natti fakkaate.
Then he looked at his watch.	Sana booda sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
Now we knew why.	Amma maaliif akka ta'e beekne.
We all have a voice.	Hundi keenya sagalee qabna.
We need to make money.	Maallaqa argachuu qabna.
I didn’t do any of them anymore.	Kana booda isaan keessaa tokkollee hin goone.
He was sure of it.	Inni mirkanaa'aa ture.
I think it's a good thing.	Waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
This works very well.	Kun baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
No one looked at him like that.	Namni akkas isa ilaale hin jiru.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin turre.
I'm looking for it.	Ani nan barbaada.
She was not a human being.	Isheen nama hin turre.
Well done.	Gaarii goote.
No one would tell me anything.	Namni homaa natti himu hin jiru ture.
When exactly did it come?	Sirriitti yoom dhufe?
Sorry if this is the wrong place.	Kun bakka hin taane yoo ta'e dhiifama.
Now it's nothing.	Amma homaa miti.
She was a little tiny.	Isheen xiqqoo xiqqoo turte.
But this is what he did.	Garuu waan inni hojjete kana.
It wasn’t going to last.	Kan turuu hin turre.
That is very important.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
But they’re totally different.	Garuu isaan guutummaatti adda.
It may not be the case.	Ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
That was easy.	Sun salphaa ture.
This is very nice.	Kun baayyee namatti tola.
I think something is wrong.	Waan tokko dogoggora natti fakkaata.
But he has to admit it.	Garuu amanuu qaba.
It sits on it.	Irra taa'a.
We’ve been doing this for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf kana gochaa turre.
I didn't want to tell you.	Sitti himuu hin barbaanne.
It must be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu qaba.
I certainly don’t know.	Ani akkan hin beekne beekamaadha.
Glad to see her.	Ishee arguu kootti gammadeera.
I’m just trying to do what I do.	Waan godhu qofa hojjechuuf yaalaa jira.
No real person does that.	Namni dhugaa akkas godhu hin jiru.
Things were different this year.	Bara kana wanti jiru adda ture.
I think the reason is obvious.	Sababni isaa ifa natti fakkaata.
There should be plenty.	Baay'ee jiraachuu qaba.
It certainly wasn’t that bad.	Akkas hamaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I can't talk about it, ever.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u, yoomiyyuu.
Who knows where he will be next week.	Torban dhufu eessa akka ta'u eenyutu beeka.
Who did this?	Eenyutu kana godhe?
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
I didn’t quite understand what they meant.	Maal jechuu isaanii sirriitti naaf hin galle.
, and.	, fi.
He knew the dangers.	Balaa isaa ni beeka ture.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu homaa hin qabu.
I want to tell myself it can never happen.	Yoomiyyuu ta'uu hin danda'u jedheen ofitti himuu barbaada.
Clearly, we really need it.	Dhuguma akka nu barbaachisu ifaadha.
So you know it was good.	Kanaaf gaarii akka ture ni beektu.
We are in it.	Nuti keessa jirra.
Once upon a time there was a shoemaker.	Yeroo tokko namni kophee hojjetu jira ture.
He has too much of his father in him.	Abbaa isaa garmalee of keessaa qaba.
But it's not going to happen.	Garuu ta'uuf hin deemu.
He knew what he wanted.	Waan barbaadu beeka ture.
He is looking after his children.	Ijoollee isaa ilaalaa jira.
We can’t even do that right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana kanaan illee hin dandeenyu.
Two other cars are there now.	Konkolaataa biraa lama amma achi jiru.
They should have something new, always.	Waan haaraa qabaachuu qabu, yeroo hunda.
But this was the time.	Kun garuu yeroon ture.
Perhaps that is true.	Tarii sun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I don’t have any issues anymore.	Kana booda dhimma tokkollee hin qabu.
Not even for you.	Siif illee miti.
This time, she didn’t have my hand.	Yeroo kana, harka koo hin qabdu turte.
Maybe I'll see them soon.	Tarii dafee isaan arguu danda'a.
The only thing was, he didn’t want to go.	Wanti jiru tokko qofa ture, inni deemuu hin barbaanne.
It was just on the road.	Karaa irra qofa ture.
Maybe enough of them.	Tarii isaan gahaa ta'uu danda'a.
But you have to stay here.	Garuu as turuu qabda.
It can be done.	Hojjechuu danda'a.
That's probably good, but not a good feeling.	Sun gaarii ta'uu hin oolu, garuu miira gaarii hin taane.
I thought we were in serious trouble.	Rakkoo hamaa keessa jirra jedheen yaade.
I didn’t think anything of it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti homaa itti hin yaadne.
It was necessary at the time.	Yeroo sanatti barbaachisaa ture.
It makes sense, so you don’t have to.	Dhimma kan hojjetu, kanaaf dirqama hin qabdu.
I do that in the morning.	Ganama akkas nan godha.
She is very nice.	Isheen baayyee namatti tola.
I don't know where it is.	Eessa akka ta'e hin beeku.
Funny, how it works like that.	Qoosaa, akkamitti akkasitti hojjeta.
I think this is good.	Kun gaarii natti fakkaata.
It was a great place.	Bakka guddaa ture.
But that wasn’t the case in my life.	Garuu jireenya koo keessatti akkas hin turre.
Just like it once was.	Akkuma yeroo tokko ture.
It came out really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti ba'e.
This time he couldn't.	Yeroo kana hin dandeenye.
I think it was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture jedheen yaada.
The timing isn’t right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii miti.
It wasn’t so much in itself.	Ofii isaa keessatti hangas hin turre.
Just him and his mother.	Isaa fi haadha isaa qofa.
Now she couldn't see her father.	Amma abbaa ishee waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye.
No one knows why.	Maaliif akka ta'e namni beeku hin jiru.
I can't leave your father.	Abbaa kee dhiisuu hin danda'u.
Then maybe I'll get a life.	Sana booda tarii jireenya argachuu danda'a.
It's not an easy thing.	Waan salphaa ta'e miti.
They were wrong, of course.	Dogoggora akka turan beekamaadha.
That certainly doesn’t work.	Sun akka hin hojjenne beekamaadha.
They certainly had plenty of food.	Nyaata baayʼee akka qaban beekamaadha.
But it was nothing.	Garuu homaa hin turre.
You would have known.	Silaa beekta.
It would have never happened.	Silaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
She was the one.	Isheen inni ture.
By his father.	Abbaa isaatiin.
You shouldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin qabdu.
We were in the same room.	Kutaa tokko keessa turre.
She had said of herself.	Ofii jettee turte.
If nothing is nothing.	Yoo homaa hin taane homaa miti.
But they already knew him.	Isaan garuu duruu isa beeku turan.
I mean, not really.	Dhuguma miti jechuu kooti.
It will be very different.	Baay'ee adda ta'a.
They were here now.	Amma as turan.
She didn’t know what to do.	Maal akka gootu hin beekne.
Are you the one? 	Ati moo?
I just have to tell you.	Sitti himuu qofa qaba.
Lots of cars.	Konkolaataa baay'ee.
From time to time	Yeroo yeroon .
He couldn’t, of course.	Hin dandeenye, beekamaadha.
You have a chance.	Carraa qabda.
I know the answer.	Deebii isaa nan beeka.
Almost none of this happened.	Kun tokkollee hin taane jechuun ni danda’ama.
It still exists.	Ammas jira.
It’s not like having a little girl.	Akka intala xiqqoo qabaachuu miti.
She was still watching us.	Ammallee nu ilaalaa turte.
I didn’t want to see that.	Sana arguu hin barbaanne.
He says it doesn’t matter where you were.	Bakka turte homaa hin qabu jedha.
Not a good answer.	Deebii gaarii miti.
But today is not a good day.	Har'a garuu guyyaa gaarii miti.
But that wasn't going to happen in my case.	Garuu dhimma koo irratti akkas ta'uu hin turre.
We didn't meet.	Wal hin argine.
Just her mother.	Haadha ishee qofa.
You really like it.	Dhugaa sitti tola.
Just a new name.	Maqaa haaraa qofa.
Saying something but not really saying it.	Waan tokko dubbachuu malee dhuguma dubbachuu dhiisuu.
I didn't think so.	Ani akkas jedhee hin yaadne.
It got me good.	Gaarii naaf argate.
Sometimes, that’s just how it works.	Yeroo tokko tokko, akkasitti qofa hojjeta.
We can’t say them any more than we can do them.	Isaan gochuu dandeenyu caalaa isaan jechuu hin dandeenyu.
He won't tell you.	Inni sitti hin himu.
Nothing mattered.	Wanti dhimma hin turre.
They didn’t want it.	Isaan hin barbaanne.
Someone who can vote.	Nama sagalee kennuu danda'u.
That may not be true.	Sun dhugaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I cannot do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandaʼu.
It does the job for you.	Hojii sana siif hojjeta.
On a book.	Kitaaba tokko irratti.
I don’t know why he went that far.	Maaliif hanga sana akka deeme hin beeku.
Just who you are.	Eenyu akka taate qofa.
The one you have right now.	Kan yeroo ammaa qabdu.
I really don’t want to do anything else.	Dhuguma kana malee waan biraa hojjechuuf hin barbaadu.
Where?' 	Eessa?'
It took a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
But there is hope.	Abdiin garuu ni jiraata.
We did very well with them.	Isaan waliin baayyee gaarii hojjenne.
He was in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa ture.
I don’t own that house.	Ani mana sana hin qabu.
It could be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
I wondered how she had it.	Akkamitti isheen qabdu jedheen yaade.
Clearly they are not.	Isaan akka hin taane ifaadha.
It was a lot.	Baay'ee ture.
Usually, both.	Yeroo baayyee, lamaan isaanii.
Everything should be fine now.	Amma wanti hundi gaarii ta'uu qaba.
They are so long!	Isaan baay'ee dheeraa dha!
But only a matter of a few weeks.	Garuu dhimma torban muraasa qofa.
It is more important than money once.	Maallaqa caalaa yeroo tokko barbaachisaa dha.
Certainly not towards me.	Gara kootti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But this is not happening.	Garuu kun ta'aa hin jiru.
It happens to many.	Baay'ee irratti ni ta'a.
Someone had to have help there.	Namni tokko achitti gargaarsa qabaachuu qaba ture.
I really don't know.	Dhuguma hin beeku.
People who didn’t want another life.	Namoota jireenya biraa hin barbaanne.
This can be both good and bad.	Kun gaarii fi hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
Times are different now.	Yeroon amma adda adda.
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
It works perfectly.	Guutummaatti ni hojjeta.
He didn't talk much about anything.	Waa'ee homaa baay'ee hin dubbanne.
It was our thing.	Waan keenya ture.
I don’t know your life.	Jireenya kee hin beeku.
She probably didn't even notice.	Isheen tarii illee hin hubanne ta'a.
All of this is probably true.	Kun hundi dhugaa taʼuu hin oolu.
It happened very quickly .	Baayyee dafee ta'e .
It wasn’t that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura hin turre.
We still have no idea what the reason is.	Ammallee sababni isaa maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabnu.
Mine no longer looks like this picture.	Kan koo kana booda suuraa kanaan hin fakkaatu.
When this doesn't happen that doesn't happen.	Yeroo kun hin taane sun hin ta'u.
That was exactly what it meant.	Wanti jedhu sirriitti kanuma ture.
Not without her help.	Gargaarsa ishee malee miti.
It still works.	Ammas ni hojjeta.
It doesn't seem like that.	Akkas hin fakkaatu.
Tell me this.	Kana natti himi.
Not with me, but with her.	Ana waliin osoo hin taane ishee waliin.
Don’t you think we should go?	Deemu qabna jettanii hin yaaddu?
He was very pleased with himself.	Ofitti baay'ee gammade.
Not in here.	As keessa miti.
There is no more work.	Kana booda hojiin hin jiru.
Another night.	Halkan biraa.
People are already going there.	Namoonni duruu achi deemaa jiru.
Maybe we should have seen it coming, but we didn't.	Tarii dhufuu isaa arguu qabna ta'a, garuu hin argine.
It wasn't much.	Baay'ee hin turre.
That's what I mean.	Kana jechuu kooti.
So they would have known.	Kanaaf silaa ni beeku turan.
I know right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana nan beeka.
Just as surely there was one.	Akkuma mirkanaa'aa tokko ture.
I want to say.	Jechuu barbaada.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
It was later to do so.	Akkas gochuun booda ture.
Which he couldn't do.	Kan gochuu hin dandeenye.
I don't know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku.
None of them were true.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee dhugaa hin turre.
He just thought it was.	Inni akkas qofa itti fakkaate.
Not that it was ever entirely true.	Guutummaatti dhugaa ta'ee beeka jechuu miti.
You just don’t have a hand anymore.	Kana booda harka hin qabdu qofa.
It may be too late now.	Amma yeroon booda ta'uu danda'a.
He wanted to go with her.	Ishee waliin deemuu barbaade.
In those days.	Bara sanatti.
Hope this helps someone later.	Kun booda nama akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
It's not my truth.	Dhugaa koo miti.
That’s why they were.	Kanaaf turan.
It was too real.	Garmalee dhugaa ture.
These people have many children.	Namoonni kun ijoollee hedduu qabu.
But that’s him.	Garuu sun isa.
I know that much.	Ani hanga sana beeka.
You can stay there.	Achi turuu dandeessu.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
A missed opportunity.	Carraa darbe.
It would have been more important than you think.	Silaa wanti ati yaaddu caalaa barbaachisaa taʼa ture.
None of this could have been told to you by anyone at the time.	Kana keessaa tokkollee yeroo sanatti namni tokkollee sitti himuu hin danda’u ture.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I am not your father.	Ani abbaa kee miti.
One great room.	Kutaa guddaa tokko.
They are now.	Isaan amma.
Please take a look and see.	Mee ilaalaa ilaalaa.
He found it easier to keep up with people.	Namoota waliin deemuun salphaa ta'ee argate.
It didn’t look bad.	Hamaa hin fakkaatu ture.
To be, not to be.	Ta'uuf, ta'uu dhiisuu.
They had to believe me.	Na amanuu qabu turan.
She had no answers.	Deebii hin qabdu turte.
I was a guy, I couldn’t do that.	Ani gurbaa ture, akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I think they’re good.	Isaan gaarii natti fakkaata.
Good times, good times.	Yeroo gaarii, yeroo gaarii.
But he couldn't stay.	Garuu turuu hin dandeenye.
I did that, and it still hasn’t worked.	Ani akkas godhe, ammallee hin hojjenne.
Wait a little longer.	Xiqqoo eegaa.
They know the old man.	Nama durii beeku.
Until recently, no one ever did.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti namni akkas godhe hin beeku.
He looked at his father's picture.	Suuraa abbaa isaa ilaale.
Just like in the old days.	Akkuma bara durii.
I thought she was very, very dangerous.	Baayyee baayyee balaa qabdi jedheen yaada ture.
That’s not his job.	Sun hojii isaa miti.
You are not right.	Ati sirrii miti.
He is doing a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjechaa jira.
There were a lot of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee turan.
Just look at me.	Mee na ilaalaa qofa.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
They were getting pretty tall.	Isaan baayyee dheeraa ta'aa turan.
I have no desire to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf fedhii hin qabu.
It’s inside me.	Keessa koo jira.
It really doesn’t matter.	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
Having the truth.	Dhugaa qabaachuu.
He understood better.	Inni caalaatti hubate.
He saw the name but thought nothing of it.	Maqaa arge malee homaa itti hin yaadne.
It was none of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
You can be whoever you can be.	Eenyu ta'uu dandeessu ta'uu dandeessa.
It’s not a car accident.	Balaa konkolaataa miti.
This is not an easy matter.	Kun dhimma salphaa miti.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
It could have been a great job for him.	Silaa isaaf hojii guddaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
He found that it was good.	Gaarii akka ta'e argate.
Looks like the right day.	Guyyaa sirrii fakkaata.
He knows too much.	Garmalee beeka.
You know that can't happen.	Sun ta'uu akka hin dandeenye ni beekta.
Hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
We had enough food.	Nyaata gahaa qabna turre.
We only knew each other one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa wal beekne.
That’s the only problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma qofa.
Which was a very long time.	Kan yeroo baayyee dheeraa ture.
There is work around.	Hojiin naannoo jira.
But something else then.	Garuu wanti biraa yeroo sana.
He had been there.	Inni achi turee ture.
And I’m right here for you.	Anis siif sirriitti as jira.
That’s how it came about.	Akkasitti dhufe.
So nobody does it.	Kanaaf namni tokkollee hin godhu.
This is not my life.	Kun jireenya koo miti.
They must be one and the same.	Tokko fi tokko ta’uu qabu.
But he did it.	Inni garuu ni godhe.
Every house around.	Mana naannoo jiru hunda.
There is no one there.	Achitti namni hin jiru.
There is no problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoon hin jiru.
As .	Akka .
He should know.	Beekuu qaba.
But it’s still going.	Garuu ammallee deemaa jira.
You know him, you know him.	Ati isa beekta.
But it is a must.	Garuu dirqama.
He wasn't in anything.	Homaa keessa hin turre.
I didn't know when enough was enough.	Yoom gahaa akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
We were there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi turre.
He really didn’t.	Dhuguma hin goone.
Everything was going well.	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti deemaa ture.
I just thought of myself up there.	Anis achi ol jedheen of yaade qofa.
' hand.	' harka.
I knew what you wanted.	Waan ati barbaaddu nan beeka ture.
It didn't look like anything she said.	Waan isheen jette homaa hin fakkaatu ture.
It can't help but be.	Ta'uu dhiisuu hin danda'u.
He is still here.	Ammallee as jira.
She was a good girl.	Intala gaarii turte.
Come back soon.	Dafee deebi'i.
There is nothing else.	Wanti biraa hin jiru.
I just thought maybe you know.	Tarii beektu qofa jedheen yaade.
It's a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu isaa.
There was little reason.	Sababni xiqqoo ture.
This time it took even longer.	Yeroo kana kana caalaa yeroo fudhate.
He knew that voice.	Sagalee sana ni beeka ture.
It was working so much!	Baay'ee hojjechaa ture!
This was his desire.	Kun fedhii isaa ture.
He seems to be waiting for something.	Waan tokko waan eegaa jiru fakkaata.
No one asked us to do it.	Namni akka goonu nu gaafate hin jiru.
It’s just a question of when.	Gaaffii yoom jedhu qofa.
This could be huge.	Kun guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
No one goes there.	Namni achi hin deemu.
Nothing happened last week.	Torban darbe wanti ta'e hin jiru.
It may or may not be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu danda'a ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It’s a good thing, not a bad thing.	Waan gaarii dha malee waan hamaa miti.
Maybe there is.	Tarii jira ta'a.
He should go back to his room.	Gara kutaa isaatti deebi'uu qaba.
There is no other opportunity.	Carraan biraa hin jiru.
But it has to be the right people.	Garuu namoota sirrii ta'uu qaba.
I don't do it.	Ani hin godhu.
Look at your watches.	Sa'aatii keessan ilaalaa.
Now it looks like everywhere else.	Amma bakka biraa hunda fakkaata.
That may be his favorite.	Sun kan inni jaallatu taʼuu dandaʼa.
They were all around.	Hundi isaanii naannoo turan.
Nothing worked.	Wanti hojjete hin jiru.
I think of nothing but work.	Hojii malee homaa hin yaadu.
It wasn’t much help.	Gargaarsa guddaa hin turre.
Look at this picture.	Suuraa kana ilaalaa.
Something really, really, really bad.	Waan dhuguma, dhuguma, dhuguma hamaa.
Who were these people?	Namoonni kun eenyu turan?
He didn’t want to live.	Jiraachuu hin barbaadu ture.
They had him.	Isa qaban turan.
Who lives there in that house?	Mana sana keessa eenyutu achi jiraata?
We have that.	Sana qabna.
It seemed unreal.	Dhugaa hin taane fakkaata ture.
It was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ture.
I don’t know how you’ll ever leave.	Akkamitti yoomiyyuu akka deemtu hin beeku.
Great house with lots of space.	Mana guddaa bakka baay'ee qabu.
But he has an idea.	Garuu yaada qaba.
She still has plenty of time.	Ammallee yeroo hedduu qabdi.
Nothing could have been better then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti kana caalaa gaarii ta’uu danda’u hin jiru.
He's going to go.	Inni ni deema.
She became a whole.	Guutuu taate.
But I can do it.	Ani garuu nan dandaʼa.
But that wasn't quite what was happening here.	Garuu asitti waan ta'aa ture guutummaatti akkas hin turre.
Clearly something is wrong here.	Asitti wanti tokko dogoggora akka jiru ifaadha.
Which he didn’t!	Kan inni hin goone!
He was glad to quit his job.	Hojii isaa dhiisuu isaatti gammade.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
Like, a lot.	Akka, baay'ee.
I don't know anything about you.	Waa'ee kee homaa hin beeku.
But it would have been nice if it had stayed.	Garuu osoo turuu gaarii ture.
It’s not doing exactly what you’ve been doing.	Waan hojjechaa turte sirriitti hojjechuu miti.
A couple of hours from now.	Amma booda sa'aatii lama lama.
But, of course, he had to go.	Garuu, beekamaadha, deemuu qaba ture.
There is no problem there.	Achitti rakkoon hin jiru.
Lots of work, big time commitments.	Hojii baay'ee, waadaa yeroo guddaa.
It happened a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ta'e.
I hope it will be.	Akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
that’s possible.	sun ni danda’ama.
A year ago.	Waggaa tokko dura.
Not sure why we need two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama maaliif akka nu barbaachisu mirkanaa'aa miti.
He didn’t want to give up.	Inni harka kennuu hin barbaanne.
He'll be great.	Inni guddaa ta'a.
It's just a handle.	Qabduu qofa.
You need help.	Gargaarsa si barbaachisa.
That’s exactly what was going on.	Wanti deemaa ture sirriitti kanuma.
I am not him.	Ani isa miti.
This is mine, though.	Kun garuu kooti.
He couldn’t, not in this case.	Inni hin dandeenye, haala kana keessatti miti.
You are doing well.	Gaarii hojjechaa jirta.
He wouldn’t have liked it.	Silaa hin jaallatu ture.
The problem with that is obvious.	Rakkoon sanaa ifaadha.
He got a lot of space.	Bakka baay'ee argate.
None of them had been here before.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee kanaan dura as hin turre.
They have a lot of answers.	Deebii baay'ee qaban.
In the environment.	Naannoo keessatti.
These had to be the bad guys.	Isaan kun namoota hamaa ta’uu qabu turan.
She was so great.	Isheen akka malee guddaa turte.
It’s a good situation.	Haala gaarii dha.
Sometimes it worked well.	Yeroo tokko tokko akka gaariitti hojjeta ture.
He thought it was something.	Inni waan tokko itti fakkaate.
If you haven't, you still shouldn't.	Yoo hin goone ta'e ammallee gochuu hin qabdu.
Find us a place.	Bakka nuuf barbaadaa.
You have to help them.	Isaan gargaaruu qabda.
He’s this great guy and a good guy.	Inni gurbaa guddaa kanaa fi gurbaa gaarii dha.
It was a great thing.	Waan guddaa ture.
We don’t have kids.	Ijoollee hin qabnu.
It’s a good job.	Hojii gaarii dha.
Someone else was in the room.	Namni biraa kutaa sana keessa ture.
I can't go.	Deemu hin danda'u.
If so, that's fine.	Yoo akkas ta'e gaarii dha.
But it was still pretty good.	Garuu ammallee baayyee gaarii ture.
But she did more than that.	Isheen garuu kana caalaa goote.
You can never tell.	Gonkumaa himuu hin dandeessu.
I didn’t want to do it now.	Amma gochuu hin barbaanne.
It doesn't mean what happened.	Waan ta'e jechuu miti.
There's not much to it.	Waan baay'ee hin jiru.
But it couldn't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I couldn’t meet my eyes.	Ija koo waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye.
I’d had enough of this nonsense.	Waan hin taane kana gahaa ture.
He does everything on time.	Waan hundumaa yeroo isaatti hojjeta.
I'm going to go.	Ani deemuuf deema.
I don't know who she is.	Eenyu akka taate hin beeku.
You just said he did that.	Ati amma qofa akkas godhe jette.
Probably a lot of them.	Tarii baay'ee isaanii.
We were right.	Sirrii turre.
But they can say something.	Garuu waan tokko jechuu danda'u.
But this one had eyes.	Inni kun garuu ija qaba ture.
We have this.	Kana qabna.
I am not a mother with them.	Ani isaan waliin haadha miti.
It can happen many times.	Yeroo baay'ee ta'uu danda'a.
You have to work for it.	Isaaf hojjechuu qabda.
That didn’t seem so bad.	Sun akkas hamaa hin fakkaatu ture.
This is not how it should be.	Kun akka ta'uu qabu miti.
But they shouldn't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin qaban.
They can help with two things.	Isaan waan lama gargaaruu danda’u.
They are good things in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti wantoota gaarii dha.
It was nothing, really.	Homaa hin turre, dhuguma.
Afterwards.	Sana booda.
I need it soon.	Dafee na barbaachisa.
He knew how to do that much.	Hamma sana akkamitti akka hojjetu beeka ture.
Maybe I started it.	Tarii kan jalqabe ana ta'uu danda'a.
We’re together all day.	Guyyaa guutuu waliin jirra.
I told him he was pretty much out of the question.	Anis akka inni baay'ee gaaffii keessaa ba'e itti hime.
No one goes anymore.	Kana booda namni hin deemu.
But even that wasn’t enough.	Garuu sun illee gahaa hin turre.
They belonged to someone else.	Kan nama biraa turan.
She had a clear voice.	Sagalee ifa ta'e qabdi turte.
We met on the road.	Karaa irratti wal argine.
Only as long as we are clear on this.	Hanga kana irratti ifa taane qofa.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
Which she can be.	Kan isheen ta'uu dandeessu.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Kun akka hin taane ifaadha.
It’s just so good.	Akkas gaarii qofa.
One of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko.
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
You can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeessu.
You can come along.	Dhufuu dandeessu.
I want to be on this.	Kana irratti ta'uu barbaada.
There’s no right or wrong, really.	Sirrii fi dogoggora hin jiru, dhuguma.
You know they have to be there for you.	Isaan siif jiraachuu akka qaban ni beekta.
Wait for the parents.	Warra eegaa.
It was a huge mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa ture.
It would never have occurred to me.	Silaa gonkumaa natti hin dhufu ture.
But then nothing happened.	Sana booda garuu wanti ta'e hin jiru.
They were expecting a lot more.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee eegaa turan.
Before that, however, there is nothing.	Sana dura garuu homaa hin jiru.
He knew that would come later.	Sun booda akka dhufu ni beeka ture.
This may not last.	Kun turuu dhiisuu danda'a.
No one did anything.	Namni homaa hin goone.
They are no longer children.	Kana booda ijoollee miti.
Maybe someone else has.	Tarii namni biraa qaba.
There is no one here.	Namni as jiru hin jiru.
I thought we agreed on that.	Sana irratti walii galle natti fakkaate.
Now he knows me.	Amma na beeka.
They have a lot of questions.	Gaaffii baay'ee qabu.
But it is still possible.	Garuu ammas ni danda'ama.
It had taken a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa fudhate ture.
That's how it worked.	Akkasitti hojjete.
I have something to tell you.	Waan sitti himu qaba.
You should stop asking.	Gaafachuu dhiisuu qabda.
He was not there this morning.	Ganama kana achi hin turre.
Really, nothing.	Dhuguma, homaa hin jiru.
But that wasn't much.	Garuu sun baayyee hin turre.
But neither did.	Garuu lamaan isaaniiyyuu hin goone.
He was great, absolutely great.	Inni guddaa ture, guutummaatti nama guddaa ture.
She was still looking at him.	Ammallee isa ilaalaa turte.
Lots of work.	Hojii baay'ee.
They were the lucky ones.	Isaan warra carraa qaban turan.
She has a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa deemuu qabdi.
It did me good.	Gaarii naaf godhe.
Not like him.	Akka isaa miti.
He wanted to, but he didn’t really know what that would look like.	Barbaada ture, garuu sun maal akka fakkaatu dhuguma hin beeku ture.
No way, just no way.	Karaa hin qabu, karaa hin qabu qofa.
When was it.	Yoom ture.
Not one of them.	Tokkollee miti.
That’s how we became real.	Akkasitti dhugaa taane.
Now, it’s not just an idea.	Amma, yaada qofa miti.
Then, a couple of days later, it would happen again.	Sana booda, guyyaa lama lama booda, ammas ni ta'a ture.
They are.	Isaan ... dha.
I told him this was no problem.	Kun rakkoo akka hin qabne itti hime.
We are in here.	As keessa jirra.
So there you have it.	Kanaaf achitti qabda.
But she’s different.	Garuu isheen adda.
It's not the same thing as being.	Ta'uu wajjin waan tokko miti.
Then I couldn’t walk anymore.	Sana booda kana booda deemuu hin dandeenye.
We are still waiting.	Ammas eegaa jirra.
Who knows why.	Maaliif akka ta'e eenyutu beeka.
I can see it in her eyes.	Ija ishee keessaa arguu danda'a.
He doesn't exist now.	Amma hin jiru.
It’s a great one.	Guddaa dha.
It's not just about you and what you want.	Waa'ee kee fi waan ati barbaaddu qofa miti.
That’s how it started.	Akkasitti jalqabe.
We don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu.
It was an hour later in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii tokko booda ture.
It was obviously someone else.	Nama biraa akka ture ifaadha.
The night is like	Halkan akka .
I mean, it’s not just me.	Ana qofa miti jechuu kooti.
I thought about it a lot.	Waa'ee kanaa baay'een yaade.
No one else was around at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namni biraa naannoo sana hin turre.
You have done nothing to me.	Ati homaa na hin goone.
I haven’t made the same mistake now.	Dogoggora wal fakkaatu amma hin hojjenne.
I want it so badly.	Ani akka malee barbaada.
Who knows what could have been.	Silaa maal ta'uu akka danda'u eenyutu beeka.
I want to do something a little different.	Waan xiqqoo adda ta'e hojjechuu barbaada.
. . . .	.
That’s not so easy.	Sun akkas salphaa miti.
There she was, the girl he loved.	Achi turte, intala inni jaallatu.
So they can get me two ways.	Kanaaf karaa lama naaf argachuu danda'u.
They didn’t have a car.	Konkolaataa hin qaban turan.
I can always have some money.	Yeroo hundumaa qarshii muraasa qabaachuu nan danda'a.
You can be a guy.	Gurbaa ta'uu dandeessa.
I didn't want to.	Ani hin barbaanne.
But it wasn't going to happen here.	Garuu asitti ta'uuf hin turre.
You have it there.	Achitti qabda.
Your mother.	Haadha kee.
I mean, he was good enough.	Inni gaarii gahaa ture jechuu kooti.
So much so.	Hanga kana.
But now he had something he could do.	Amma garuu waan hojjechuu danda'u qaba ture.
It was a terrible problem.	Rakkoo hamaa ture.
They always were, both of them.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas turan, lamaan isaanii.
I don't know what you're going to do.	Maal akka gootu hin beeku.
My little one looks a lot like your daughter.	Xiqqoo koo baayyee intala kee fakkaata.
Here you can tell it or not.	Asitti itti himuu fi dhiisuu dandeessu.
He says it’s not what you think.	Akka ati yaaddu miti jedha.
This was their workplace.	Kun bakka hojii isaanii ture.
This is no longer the case.	Kana booda kun hin jiru.
He gave us that opportunity.	Carraa sana nuuf kenne.
He was certainly something very special.	Inni waan baayʼee adda taʼe akka ture beekamaadha.
I don’t understand why it doesn’t work.	Maaliif akka hin hojjenne naaf hin galle.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
Never.	Gonkumaa.
They are waiting for him.	Isa eegaa jiru.
I don't know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
You may be bigger than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa guddaa taʼuu dandeessa.
Everyone can see what it is.	Maal akka ta'e namni hundi arguu danda'a.
You have to help me.	Na gargaaruu qabda.
I love your hands.	Harka kee nan jaalladha.
If they’re not right though, you have to say so.	Yoo isaan sirrii hin taane garuu jechuu qabda.
A lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee.
Neither of us said anything.	Lamaan keenyayyuu homaa hin dubbanne.
Are they good enough?	Isaan gaarii ta’uu?
I hope it helps.	Akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
What you think becomes you.	Wanti ati yaaddu si ta'a.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
They help us.	Isaan nu gargaaru.
That may have something to do with it.	Sun waan tokko qabaachuu danda’a.
That’s just a theory though.	Sun garuu yaada qofa.
This doesn't seem to have happened.	Kun waan ta'e hin fakkaatu.
She didn't want to play very often.	Yeroo baayyee taphachuu hin barbaaddu turte.
Then the problem seems different.	Sana booda rakkoon jiru adda fakkaata.
Everything we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda.
We are not that kind of place.	Nuti bakka akkasii miti.
I don't know about you guys.	Waa'ee kee hin beeku gurbaa.
Sometimes it's been pretty good.	Yeroo tokko tokko baayyee gaarii ta'ee jira.
Not exactly like that.	Sirrii akkas miti.
He knew those things.	Wantoota sana ni beeka ture.
So good inside me.	Kanaaf gaarii keessa kooti.
What could possibly go wrong?.	Maaltu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a?.
This is very obvious.	Kun baayyee ifaadha.
They need it a lot.	Baay'ee isaan barbaachisa.
People can only handle so much.	Namoonni waan baay'ee qofa danda'u.
You can't believe it.	Amanuu hin dandeessu.
He is very important to us.	Inni nuuf baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
There wasn't much to that.	Sana keessa waan baay'ee hin turre.
She couldn't be an adult.	Isheen nama guddaa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
It is possible, however.	Ni danda'ama garuu.
But you may not be in that situation.	Garuu ati haala sana keessa hin jirtu ta'a.
I am certainly not.	Ani akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
This, however, was no more.	Kun garuu kana caalaa hin turre.
It was something we could help with.	Wanti nuti gargaaruu dandeenyu ture.
I don’t think we need their help.	Gargaarsa isaanii waan nu barbaachisu natti hin fakkaatu.
She certainly was.	Isheen akka turte beekamaadha.
I have no idea how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu.
I mean, that’s okay.	Sun homaa miti jechuu kooti.
This is just the way it is now.	Kun akkuma amma jiru qofa.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
We must be together again.	Ammas waliin ta'uu qabna.
This is not entirely accurate.	Kun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
It's pretty much the same.	Baay'ee wal fakkaata.
She's not doing very well today.	Har'a baayyee gaarii hin jirtu.
That was last month.	Sun ji'a darbe ture.
I don't want the truth.	Ani dhugaa hin barbaadu.
Now he could do a little better.	Amma kana caalaa xiqqoo hojjechuu danda'a ture.
He’s not just bad and evil.	Inni hamaa fi hamaa qofa miti.
I can tell you it was some work.	Hojii tokko tokko akka ture sitti himuu nan danda'a.
But there was no one else in the car.	Garuu konkolaataa sana keessa namni biraa hin turre.
He became a father.	Abbaa ta'e.
That’s a possibility.	Sun ta’uu danda’a.
You don't have to do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin qabdu.
Maybe no one knew.	Tarii namni beeku hin turre ta'a.
Now it will never happen.	Amma gonkumaa hin ta'u.
There was little she could do.	Isheen gochuu dandeessu xiqqoo ture.
It was what everyone thought.	Waan namni hundi yaadu ture.
He’s not that tall.	Inni hangas dheeraa miti.
We're joking.	Nuti qoosaa.
Clearly, he has.	Akka qabu ifaadha.
It seemed like it happened in a moment.	Yeroo muraasa keessatti waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
But they do work.	Garuu ni hojjetu.
It's too good to be true.	Baayyee gaarii dha dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I doubt that was one of us though.	Sun garuu nu keessaa tokko akka ture nan shakka.
None of that works.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjetu.
You don't have me.	Ati na hin qabdu.
You have a feeling.	Miira qabda.
But something wasn’t right.	Garuu wanti tokko sirrii hin turre.
There was nothing.	Wanti tokkollee hin turre.
I don’t know why you don’t see that.	Maaliif akkas akka hin argine hin beeku.
It looked really, really bad last year.	Bara darbe dhuguma dhuguma hamaa fakkaata ture.
I think it's the right thing to do.	Ani waan sirrii ta'e natti fakkaata.
We are not children.	Nuti ijoollee miti.
I don’t want to.	Hin barbaadu.
No questions about it.	Waa'ee isaa gaaffii hin qabu.
That can be a problem.	Sun rakkoo taʼuu dandaʼa.
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
That is obviously incorrect.	Sun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
I need that.	Sana na barbaachisa.
That year.	Bara sana.
It wasn’t himself.	Ofii isaa hin turre.
It's not going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin deemu.
I don’t know how he did that.	Akkamitti akkas godhe hin beeku.
I think he just doesn’t know what to do.	Waan godhu qofa akka hin beekne natti fakkaata.
I knew her well enough.	Ani akka gaariitti ishee beeka ture.
He looked at himself.	Of ilaale.
It really can be that bad.	Dhuguma hangas hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
She was my mother.	Haadha koo turte.
I want to go somewhere.	Bakka deemuu barbaada.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
We just need more of it.	Kana caalaa nu barbaachisa qofa.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
That’s just the truth of it.	Sun dhugaa isaa qofa.
Tell me what happened.	Waan ta'e natti himi.
In there for a long time.	Achi keessa yeroo dheeraa.
It’s not just a good time.	Yeroo gaarii qofa miti.
I just don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e qofa hin beeku.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
They need you more than you need this .	Kana si barbaachisu caalaa isaan si barbaadu .
He is here with us in this room.	Kutaa kana keessa nu waliin as jira.
This was a long time ago now.	Kun yeroo dheeraa dura ture amma.
It didn’t do me any good.	Gaarii naaf hin goone.
He wanted to go home.	Gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaade.
I didn’t notice a sound.	Sagalee tokkollee hin hubanne.
Worst mistake of my life.	Dogoggora jireenya koo keessatti isa hamaa.
Then it got easier.	Sana booda salphaa ta'e.
Do you have any questions?	Gaaffii qabduu?
You really know them.	Dhuguma isaan beekta.
His father, long ago.	Abbaa isaa, yeroo dheeraa dura.
That you do whatever is best for you.	Waan siif ta'u hunda akka gootu.
I can't say why.	Maaliif jechuu hin danda'u.
And yet, not ever.	Ammas ta'ee gonkumaa miti.
Maybe we never did.	Tarii nuti gonkumaa hin goone ta'a.
He loves school.	Mana barumsaa ni jaallata.
It matters too much.	Garmalee dhimma qaba.
In the past month.	Ji'a darbe keessa.
I can't believe this.	Kana amanuu hin danda'u.
We will never do that again.	Kana booda gonkumaa akkas hin goonu.
Maybe you really didn't want to know.	Tarii dhuguma beekuu hin barbaanne ta'a.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Dirqama akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
That was the idea.	Sun yaada ture.
I think you’ll like it there.	Achitti ni jaallattu jedheen yaada.
We should have done better.	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna turre.
But this seems not to be the case.	Garuu kun akkas miti fakkaata.
How did he get this job?	Hojii kana akkamitti argate?
I couldn't do it.	Hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
He’s really in a lot of trouble.	Dhuguma rakkoo guddaa keessa jira.
Maybe it's not true.	Tarii dhugaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It was mine.	Kan koo ture.
I couldn’t do this anymore.	Kana booda kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
Tom is looking for a new job.	Toom hojii haaraa barbaada.
But that wasn’t true.	Garuu sun dhugaa hin turre.
It's going to be a great day.	Guyyaa guddaa ta'uuf jira.
I don’t know how many times we have to say that.	Yeroo meeqa akkas jechuu akka qabnu hin beeku.
They are the parents.	Isaan warra.
But it doesn’t work here.	Garuu asitti hin hojjetu.
I couldn’t even respond.	Deebii illee kennuu hin dandeenye.
It was tall and big.	Dheeraa fi guddaa ture.
I don't fully understand what's going on here.	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru guutummaatti naaf hin galle.
They are all hopeless.	Hundi isaanii abdii hin qabne.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Waan guddaa hin turre.
I couldn't have done it.	Silaa hojjechuu hin danda'u ture.
If you just need money.	Yoo maallaqa qofa si barbaachisu ta'e.
It was just like that.	Akka waan akkasii qofa ture.
Its a very good idea.	Yaada isaa baayyee gaarii dha.
But it’s not enough for us.	Garuu nu gahaa miti.
Sounds like a lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa fakkaata.
I have to go quickly.	Dafee deemuun qaba.
Of course, he doesn't.	Akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
This was all true.	Kun hundi dhugaa ture.
We only have it today.	Har'a qofa qabna.
But then something happens.	Garuu sana booda wanti tokko ni ta'a.
It seemed so real.	Akkas dhugaa fakkaata ture.
I hope you are not in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa akka hin galle abdiin qaba.
He’s the only one.	Inni qofa.
No one else could have known.	Namni biraa beekuu hin danda'u ture.
He had three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba ture.
I looked around the bar.	Anis naannoo mana dhugaatii sanaa ilaale.
That should definitely help.	Sun gargaaruu akka qabu beekamaadha.
I wasn’t there anymore.	Kana booda ani hin turre.
I thought you were.	Ati natti fakkaate.
Eat.	Nyaachuu.
And it was still.	Ammas ture.
That would be a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii ta'a.
You may be interested.	Fedhii qabaachuu dandeessa.
She is wrong.	Isheen dogoggora qabdi.
Look inside, no one there, nothing there.	Keessa ilaalaa, namni achi hin jiru, achi homaa hin jiru.
He was a tall man.	Nama dheeraa ture.
They really were.	Dhuguma isaan turan.
You should never have gotten anything.	Silaa gonkumaa waan tokko argachuu hin qabdu turte.
He was in this state for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf haala kana keessa ture.
This was very nice.	Kun baayyee namatti tola ture.
Glad to have you both.	Lamaan keessan qabaachuu kootti gammadeera.
He shouldn't have had to.	Silaa dirqama ta'uu hin qabu ture.
That could be a real possibility.	Sun carraa dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
Now, it’s time.	Amma, yeroon isaa amma.
He knew better than he knew himself.	Of beeku caalaa beeka ture.
There's nothing more he can do, really.	Kana caalaa wanti inni gochuu danda'u hin jiru, dhuguma.
He had food.	Nyaata qaba ture.
That worked for me at the time.	Sun yeroo sanatti naaf hojjete.
He knows it.	Inni ni beeka.
Must.	Dirqama.
More like their parents.	Caalaatti warra isaanii fakkaatu.
They should have been.	Silaa ta'uu qabu turan.
It wasn’t just talking.	Dubbachuu qofa hin turre.
You are important.	Ati barbaachisaa dha.
Everyone there knows her.	Achitti namni hundi ishee beeka.
You can always get three bays.	Yeroo hundumaa baay'ee sadii argachuu dandeessa.
Her work didn’t seem like enough.	Hojiin ishee waan gahaa hin fakkaatu ture.
But that matters little.	Garuu sun dhimma xiqqoo qaba.
Otherwise, you’re in trouble.	Yoo kana hin taane rakkoo keessa jirta.
I didn’t think he was good enough.	Inni gaarii natti hin fakkaatu ture.
I just can't go back to that place.	Bakka sanatti qofa deebi'uu hin danda'u.
I thought so, too.	Anis akkas jedheen yaade.
It was pretty bad, really.	Baayyee hamaa ture, dhuguma.
You don’t need this.	Kana si hin barbaachisu.
This is right.	Kun sirrii dha.
He thought he had been there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf waan achi ture itti fakkaate.
It seemed too simple.	Garmalee salphaa fakkaata ture.
They can do bad things.	Waan hamaa gochuu danda'u.
I don’t love myself.	Of hin jaalladhu.
It is not an annual subscription.	Maallaqa waggaa miti.
Today was a great day.	Har'a guyyaa guddaa ture.
He lives with his father.	Abbaa isaa waliin jiraata.
This was her thing, of course.	Kun waan ishee ture beekamaadha.
This worked perfectly fine.	Kun guutummaatti gaarii ta'ee hojjete.
But that may be easier said than done.	Garuu sun dubbachuu caalaa gochuu caalaa salphaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
But it will be fine with two of us.	Garuu nu lama waliin gaarii ta'a.
It was just new and different at the time.	Yeroo sanatti haaraa fi adda ta'e qofa ture.
It certainly wasn’t ours.	Kan keenya akka hin turre beekamaadha.
There is only one problem.	Rakkoon jiru tokko qofa.
All of this took time.	Kun hundi yeroo fudhate.
No one really knows much about it.	Dhuguma namni waa'ee kanaa waan baay'ee beeku hin jiru.
She had a name.	Maqaa qabdi turte.
I didn’t think anything of it.	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne.
They could have done other things in life.	Jireenya keessatti waan biraa hojjechuu dandaʼu turan.
But that’s not important.	Garuu sun barbaachisaa miti.
Where should we go today?	Har'a eessa deemuu qabna?
But he didn’t want to admit that.	Garuu sana amanuu hin barbaanne ture.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
But this need not be so.	Garuu kun akkas ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
He walked on the road.	Karaa irra deeme.
He had to tell her.	Itti himuu qaba ture.
Not up here.	As ol miti.
She had an idea.	Isheen yaada qabdi turte.
We have some questions.	Gaaffii tokko tokko qabna.
Everything else has to go.	Wanti biraa hundi deemuu qaba.
I just thought it was a joke.	Qoosaa qofa natti fakkaate.
Just a year ago.	Waggaa tokko dura qofa.
That is not the case now.	Amma akkas miti.
This whole thing is new.	Wanti kun hundi haaraa dha.
It was a potentially great thing.	Waan guddaa ta'uu danda'u ture.
Today, however, is different.	Har'a garuu adda.
I don’t know why they can’t just live together.	Maaliif waliin jiraachuu qofa akka hin dandeenye hin beeku.
I probably was then, too.	Anis yeroo sanatti akkas taʼuu hin oolu.
We cannot know that it is not true.	Dhugaa akka hin taane beekuu hin dandeenyu.
Better than never after an accident.	Balaa booda gonkumaa caalaa gaarii dha.
Today, everyone wants a car!	Har'a namni hundi konkolaataa barbaada!
Nothing is coming.	Wanti dhufu hin jiru.
But that doesn’t mean it’s not important.	Garuu sun barbaachisaa miti jechuu miti.
He told us everything he had done that day.	Guyyaa sana waan hojjete hunda nutti hime.
I don’t want them.	Ani isaan hin barbaadu.
He looked at his hand again.	Ammas harka isaa ilaale.
He hadn't thought of the possibilities.	Inni waan ta'uu danda'u hin yaadne ture.
They make our house a home.	Mana keenya mana godhu.
I like that.	Sana natti tola.
I couldn't find a place.	Bakka argachuu hin dandeenye.
This did not look very good.	Kun baayyee gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
But she .	Garuu isheen .
I love everyone at home.	Nama mana jiru hunda nan jaalladha.
I have a job for you.	Hojii siif qaba.
This happens sometimes.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko ni ta’a.
He had nothing to say.	Waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
But it's one thing.	Garuu waan tokko.
And I went upstairs.	Anis ol ba'e.
Fox would have known.	Saree silaa ni beeka ture.
Can you help me with my homework?	Hojii manaa koo irratti na gargaaruu dandeessaa?
They are in plain error.	Dogoggora ifa ta’e keessa jiru.
I think it was like that.	Akkas ture jedheen yaada.
There is no reason.	Sababni tokkollee hin jiru.
That can't be right!	Sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u!
Did that seem right?	Sun sirrii fakkaata turee?
Not much was happening.	Waan baay'een ta'aa hin turre.
Nothing.	Homaa.
He knows something is not quite right.	Wanti tokko guutummaatti sirrii akka hin taane ni beeka.
As .	Akka .
She was a little girl.	Isheen intala xiqqoo turte.
You have a dog.	Saree qabda.
Perhaps he could not.	Tarii hin dandeenye taʼa.
I have a lot of very important work to do in the morning.	Ganama hojii baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e baay'een qaba.
People still want to do something.	Namoonni ammallee waan tokko gochuu barbaadu.
He wouldn’t make that kind of mistake.	Dogoggora akkasii hin hojjetu ture.
He certainly hadn’t been there before.	Kanaan dura achi akka hin deemne beekamaadha.
Right.	Sirrii.
There isn't much.	Baay'ee hin jiru.
She had it.	Isheen qabdi turte.
Wrong wrong wrong.	Dogoggora dogoggora dogoggora.
A question with as many answers.	Gaaffii hamma deebii qabu.
Like he didn’t mean it.	Akkuma jechuu hin barbaanne.
It was just myself again.	Ammas ofii koo qofa ture.
He wants to live here in his house with his mother.	Haadha isaa waliin as mana isaa keessa jiraachuu barbaada.
But there's not much we can do about it.	Garuu wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu baay'ee hin jiru.
But not now, not this way.	Garuu amma miti, akkasitti miti.
But that was never his way.	Garuu sun gonkumaa karaa isaa hin turre.
There’s always nothing.	Yeroo hunda homaa hin jiru.
It was nothing , really.	Homaa hin turre , dhuguma.
I really like this one.	Isa kana baayyee natti tola.
You have to believe me about that.	Waa'ee sanaa na amanuu qabda.
Not just now.	Amma qofa miti.
Except for my wife.	Haadha manaa koo malee.
One too many.	Tokko garmalee baay'ee.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
He wants to go.	Ni deemu barbaada.
He is not quite right.	Inni guutummaatti sirrii miti.
That’s not my issue.	Sun dhimma koo miti.
They say it's good.	Gaarii ta'e jedhu.
I don't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu.
He’s going to stay here, with me.	Inni as turuuf jira, na waliin.
You can’t do anything.	Waan tokko hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
That’s not going to help.	Sun gargaaruuf hin deemu.
This was really quite simple.	Kun dhuguma baayʼee salphaa ture.
Very long.	Baayyee dheeraa.
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
We can’t stay here.	As turuu hin dandeenyu.
Everything is still on.	Wanti hundi ammallee irra jira.
That was completely wrong.	Sun guutummaatti dogoggora ture.
This was no longer a part of it.	Kun kana booda kutaa isaa hin turre.
I’m still waiting for that.	Ammas sana eegaa jira.
It was all just too real.	Hundi isaa garmalee dhugaa qofa ture.
I wish we hadn’t met.	Osoo wal hin argine gaarii ture.
With everyone, it’s different.	Nama hunda waliin, adda adda.
This was very easy to do.	Kun gochuun baayʼee salphaa ture.
Some great amounts.	Hamma guddaa tokko tokko.
I think it's true.	Dhugaa natti fakkaata.
I don’t know her that well.	Ani akkasitti ishee hin beeku.
I have been waiting at home for a long time now.	Amma yeroo dheeraaf mana eegaa ture.
But that thing .	Garuu wanti sun .
I couldn’t live without you.	Si malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
Has anyone seen her?	Namni ishee arge jiraa?
One can do this for a long time.	Namni tokko yeroo dheeraaf kana gochuu danda’a.
They can always play together.	Yeroo hundumaa waliin taphachuu danda'u.
That he can see it.	Akka inni arguu danda'u.
You are in my house.	Mana koo keessa jirta.
I have no one to help me.	Nama na gargaaru hin qabu.
But not today.	Har'a garuu miti.
I can go along with that.	Sana waliin deemuu nan danda'a.
Not everyone does that.	Namni hundi akkas hin godhu.
Only this time he wasn’t interested.	Yeroo kana qofa fedhii hin qabu ture.
I don't have any chance.	Carraa tokkollee hin qabu.
I just love it so much.	Baay'ee jaalladha qofa.
I am a human being.	Ani nama.
It’s all in place.	Hundi isaa bakka isaa jira.
You shouldn't even ask.	Osoo illee gaafachuu hin qabdu.
There were not many people on the street.	Karaa irratti namoonni baay'een hin turre.
It was good here.	Asitti gaarii ture.
It's still on.	Ammallee irra jira.
Now I know what it is.	Amma maal akka ta'e beeka.
But now we have to work too hard.	Garuu amma garmalee hojjechuu qabna.
He had a guy with him.	Gurbaa tokko isa waliin qaba ture.
I want to do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuun barbaada.
I made my day then.	Guyyaa koo yeroo sana godhe.
This was wrong here.	Kun asitti dogoggora ture.
It would be a mistake not to.	Osoo hin taane dogoggora ta'a.
It shouldn't have existed.	Jiraachuu hin qabu ture.
This was obviously a problem.	Kun rakkoo akka ture beekamaadha.
You can’t believe what he says.	Waan inni jedhu amanuu hin dandeessu.
The one who does that is a girl.	Kan akkas gootu intala.
This must be the case.	Kun ta'uu qaba.
We must have gone two or three times.	Yeroo lama sadii deemne ta’uu qaba.
Maybe it's a lot of things.	Tarii waan baay'ee ta'uu danda'a.
I know exactly.	Ani sirriitti beeka.
This is very obvious.	Kun baayyee ifaadha.
I love them so much.	Baay'een isaan jaalladha.
But that’s how it works.	Garuu akkasitti hojjeta.
He wants to be with people like him.	Namoota akka isaa wajjin taʼuu barbaada.
I looked at them.	Anis isaan ilaale.
There’s more where that came from, always.	Bakka sun dhufe caalaa jira, yeroo hundumaa.
This may or may not be true.	Kun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa, taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
They know we have to do something now.	Amma waan tokko gochuu akka qabnu ni beeku.
I don't want to be alone.	Kophaa ta'uu hin barbaadu.
Like this is just tonight.	Akka waan kun halkan kana qofa.
Her old life.	Jireenya ishee durii.
On the idea of ​​work.	Yaada hojii irratti.
Look at that hand.	Harka sana ilaalaa.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
Please seek help.	Mee gargaarsa barbaadaa.
This does not mean that we should speak out.	Kana jechuun guutummaatti dubbachuu qabna jechuu miti.
They have no feelings about it.	Isaan kana irratti miira hin qaban.
He knew better than that.	Kana caalaa beeka ture.
I have no real friends.	Hiriyyoota dhugaa hin qabu.
I didn’t really agree with it.	Dhuguma irratti walii hin galle.
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.	Tarii sun waan hamaa akkasii miti ta'a.
It was a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa ture.
I think this definitely helps.	Kun akka gargaaru beekamaadha jedheen yaada.
You should never give up.	Gonkumaa harka kennuu hin qabdu.
I will do what it takes to make that happen.	Sun akka ta'uuf waan barbaachisu nan godha.
But they are not mine.	Garuu isaan kan koo miti.
This was terrible.	Kun hamaa ture.
I could never stay.	Gonkumaa turuu hin dandeenye.
It certainly worked very well for us.	Baayyee gaarii akka nuuf hojjete beekamaadha.
But this works both ways.	Kun garuu karaa lamaan hojjeta.
Great job.	Hojii guddaa.
That was terrible.	Sun hamaa ture.
Which is not.	Kan miti.
She still wasn’t looking his way.	Ammallee karaa isaa hin ilaalaa turte.
But you were different.	Ati garuu adda turte.
They’re not kids, exactly.	Isaan ijoollee miti, sirriitti.
At that time	Yeroo sanatti .
Look at those eyes.	Ija sana ilaalaa.
He got the idea for the name from his daughter.	Yaada maqaa kanaaf intala isaa irraa argate.
People like you.	Namoonni akka kee.
He took another one.	Kan biraa fudhate.
Maybe we all should be.	Tarii hundi keenya ta'uu qabna.
I love being me.	Ana ta'uu nan jaalladha.
Now there is a problem.	Amma rakkoon jira.
Look at it here.	As ilaalaa.
These are my things.	Kun wantoota kooti.
No one knew him anymore.	Sana booda namni isa beeku hin jiru ture.
Like they really might have.	Akkuma dhuguma qabaachuu danda'u.
Today was the day.	Har'a guyyaa ture.
There is no time now.	Amma yeroon hin jiru.
I love my house.	Mana koo nan jaalladha.
Just one afternoon.	Waaree booda tokko qofa.
Now was my chance.	Amma carraan koo ture.
I shouldn’t have said anything.	Silaa homaa dubbachuu hin qabu ture.
No one loves her.	Namni ishee jaallatu hin jiru.
I was his everything.	Ani waan hundumaa isaa ture.
I have an idea of ​​what we can do.	Waan hojjechuu dandeenyu yaada qaba.
He needed money.	Maallaqa barbaada ture.
But inside!!.	Garuu keessa!!.
Just wait and see.	Eegaa qofa.
There may be.	Jiraachuu danda'a.
I knew it would happen.	Akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
But maybe enough.	Garuu tarii gahaa ta'uu danda'a.
Everyone wants all that.	Sana hunda namni hundi barbaada.
He was here before.	Dura as ture.
I think that’s right.	Sun sirrii natti fakkaata.
Everyone is different.	Namni hundi adda adda.
If nothing happens, you are good to go.	Yoo wanti tokkollee hin taane deemuuf gaarii dha.
I wasn’t there.	Ani hin turre.
But people do that.	Namoonni garuu akkas godhu.
I think that would be great.	Sun baay'ee gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada.
He is working very hard.	Baayyee hojjechaa jira.
I hadn’t really thought this through.	Kana sirriitti hin yaadne ture.
He understood why not.	Maaliif akka hin taane hubate.
Then, no answer ever comes.	Sana booda, deebii tokkollee gonkumaa hin dhufu.
I think we did that.	Akkas goone natti fakkaata.
Who said what.	Eenyu maal jedhe.
He was that good.	Inni akkas gaarii ture.
It’s not one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko miti.
I know you’re right.	Sirrii akka taate nan beeka.
She was right.	Isheen sirrii turte.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
I’m not here as a human being.	Ani akka nama asitti hin jiru.
Probably more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu hin oolu.
It was perfect with her.	Ishee waliin guutuu ture.
We were going to make a night of it.	Halkan tokko itti gochuuf turre.
The two are different.	Lamaan isaanii adda adda.
That's what he said it should be.	Kana ta'uu qaba jedhe.
But that’s not entirely true.	Garuu sun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
We’re trying to do this all the time.	Kana yeroo hunda hojjechuuf yaalaa jirra.
But he was a good man.	Garuu nama gaarii ture.
Nothing too bad.	Wanti baayyee hamaa hin jiru.
This is just not the case.	Kun akkas miti qofa.
But we are together now.	Garuu amma waliin jirra.
Again, a detailed answer.	Ammas deebii bal'aa.
It was fresh and new.	Haaraa fi haaraa ture.
It had to happen now.	Amma ta'uu qaba ture.
You may not really know anyone there.	Dhuguma nama achi jiru hin beektu ta'a.
Tell me where you are.	Bakka jirtu natti himi.
But there is no such thing.	Garuu wanti akkasii hin jiru.
But he didn't tell.	Garuu hin himne.
She’s interested, sometimes.	Fedhii qabdi, yeroo tokko tokko.
But it’s not good.	Garuu gaarii miti.
It’s just money.	Maallaqa qofa.
But it never worked.	Gonkumaa garuu hin hojjenne.
Maybe it never will.	Tarii gonkumaa hin ta'u ta'a.
It was really special.	Dhuguma adda ture.
I hope it goes well.	Akka gaariitti akka deemu abdiin qaba.
I want you to know this.	Kana akka beektu nan barbaada.
It happens a lot in this one.	Isa kana keessatti baay'ee ta'a.
I am very new to it.	Ani baayyee haaraa dha.
He knows it’s not easy.	Salphaa akka hin taane ni beeka.
I love that.	Sana nan jaalladha.
Now he had a job, a proper job.	Amma hojii qaba ture, hojii sirrii ta'e.
We don’t have it.	Nuti hin qabnu.
I know what is right and true.	Waan sirrii fi dhugaa ta'e nan beeka.
Sorry it doesn't work like that.	Dhiifama akkasitti hin hojjetu.
That's how it worked.	Akkasitti hojjete.
They were just there.	Isaan achi qofa turan.
He didn’t know that no one had him.	Namni akka isa hin qabne hin beeku ture.
I think that's it.	Kana natti fakkaata.
We can never do it.	Gonkumaa hin dandeenyu.
A lot of people do this stuff.	Namoonni baay'een waan kana godhu.
Good but not great.	Gaarii malee guddaa miti.
They knew what he had done.	Waan inni hojjete ni beeku turan.
Then you have to do the same thing.	Sana booda kanuma gochuu qabda.
It’s just what you have to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu qofa.
He had no answer.	Deebii hin qabu ture.
But, you know?	Garuu, beektaa?
Those people need to do something within themselves.	Namoonni sun of keessaa waan tokko hojjechuu qabu.
It was his, of course.	Kan isaa akka ture beekamaadha.
She was exactly what you would imagine.	Isheen sirriitti waan ati yaaddu turte.
It will never be worse.	Gonkumaa kana caalaa hamaa hin ta'u.
Only you can do this.	Kana gochuu kan dandeessu si qofa.
We were only a few years old.	Umuriin keenya waggaa muraasa qofa ture.
I was in, he was after me.	Ani keessa ture, inni na booda.
This can be dangerous.	Kun balaa ta'uu danda'a.
She had only one dress.	Uffata tokko qofa qabdi turte.
I couldn’t get it to work.	Ani hojjechuuf argachuu hin dandeenye.
But that was fine.	Garuu sun gaarii ture.
They don’t have the problem.	Rakkoon jiru hin qaban.
No one has ever done that.	Namni akkas godhe hin beeku.
You know things they don’t.	Wantoota isaan hin beekne ni beekta.
He doesn’t seem to get it.	Inni waan argate hin fakkaatu.
It shouldn't exist.	Jiraachuu hin qabu.
This is unforgivable.	Kun dhiifama hin qabu.
You can stay home with us.	Nu waliin mana turuu dandeessu.
It wouldn’t have helped.	Silaa hin gargaaru ture.
You don’t have to do anything more.	Kana caalaa homaa gochuu hin qabdu.
We were here.	Nuti as turre.
I would have nothing now.	Silaa amma homaa hin qabu ture.
It seemed unimportant.	Barbaachisaa kan hin taane fakkaata ture.
It's a very new thing.	Waan baay'ee haaraa dha.
I know you love me.	Akka na jaallattu nan beeka.
It just looks good.	Gaarii fakkaata qofa.
At night, it was as dangerous as that.	Halkan, akkuma sun balaa qaba ture.
But maybe that was good enough.	Garuu tarii sun gaarii ture ta'a.
No one else would do it.	Namni biraa hin godhu ture.
Everyone has to work through that.	Sana keessaa namni hundi hojjechuu qaba.
She wasn't supposed to know that but she certainly did.	Isheen sana beekuu hin qabdu turte garuu akka beektu beekamaadha.
I know that for sure.	Sana mirkanaa'aa ta'ee beeka.
It's a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii dha.
This seems like a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa fakkaata.
Nothing else worked.	Wanti biraa hojjete hin jiru.
A new house.	Mana haaraa.
He wants to live.	Jiraachuu barbaada.
It was a great place.	Bakka guddaa ture.
We were hopeless.	Abdii malee turre.
This is it! 	Kun isa!
I can't see things very well.	Waan tokko akka gaariitti arguu hin danda'u.
You have to be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu qabda.
We are good enough.	Nuti gaarii dha.
Not even your life.	Jireenya kee illee miti.
It was a huge disaster.	Balaa guddaa ture.
But it’s not enough.	Garuu gahaa miti.
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
I thought you were obliged.	Dirqama irra jirtu natti fakkaate.
Often, however, they are different.	Yeroo baay’ee garuu adda adda.
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
I want to buy a house.	Mana bitachuu nan barbaada.
I don't have such a chance.	Carraa akkasii hin qabu.
I thought it was pretty big at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baayyee guddaa natti fakkaate.
Things are not easy for me now.	Amma wanti naaf salphaa miti.
Can you give it to me.	Naaf kennuu dandeessaa.
Which you want.	Kan ati barbaaddu.
He didn't want to.	Hin barbaadu ture.
Clearly, there is nothing like her.	Waan akka ishee akka hin jirre ifaadha.
It doesn’t look too good.	Garmalee gaarii hin fakkaatu.
It was a good time.	Yeroon sun yeroo gaarii ture.
But that wasn’t all.	Garuu kana qofa hin turre.
I looked just like him.	Anis akkuma isaa fakkaata ture.
That’s not what I want.	Kan ani barbaadu kana miti.
Is there anyone there?	Namni achi jiraa?
That was nothing.	Sun homaa hin turre.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
A great danger.	Balaa guddaa.
I know some people were looking for that.	Namoonni tokko tokko sana barbaadaa akka turan nan beeka.
He goes to school.	Mana barumsaa ni deema.
You really shouldn’t do that.	Dhuguma akkas gochuu hin qabdu.
I have plenty of space.	Bakka baay'een qaba.
I told him the truth.	Anis dhugaa itti hime.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
Maybe it won't be that bad.	Tarii hangas hamaa hin ta'u ta'a.
I think he really meant what he said.	Dhuguma waan jedhe jechuu isaa natti fakkaata.
I don’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabu.
He wouldn't go.	Inni hin deemu ture.
Clearly, this is not entirely true.	Kun guutummaatti dhugaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
I have been waiting to do that for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas gochuuf eegaa ture.
We are doing everything we can.	Waan dandeenyu hunda gochaa jirra.
You think you know everything about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan hunda waan beektu sitti fakkaata.
You have to go.	Deemu qabda.
Perhaps he could find her.	Tarii ishee argachuu dandaʼa taʼa.
This was still his home.	Kun ammallee mana isaa ture.
I wanted her with her.	Ishee waliin ishee barbaade.
You have it.	Ati adda.
There was so much she didn't know.	Wanti isheen hin beekne baay'ee ture.
You have enough time.	Yeroo gahaa qabda.
You can do whatever you need to.	Waan si barbaachisu hunda gochuu dandeessa.
I couldn’t get enough books.	Kitaaba gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
We can’t say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin dandeenyu.
But that is not what happens.	Garuu wanti ta'u akkas miti.
He’s a really good guy.	Dhuguma gurbaa gaarii dha.
But our luck is not good this time.	Garuu carraan keenya yeroo kana gaarii miti.
Look at it first.	Dura ilaalaa ilaalaa.
I don't like that.	Ani akkas hin jaalladhu.
Really ???, what are they doing to you ???.	Dhuguma ???, maal si gochaa jiru ???.
You could be one of those people.	Namoota sana keessaa tokko taʼuu dandeessa.
I have to do something.	Waan tokko gochuun qaba.
But, this is nothing new.	Garuu, kun waan haaraa miti.
Before my mouth.	Afaan koo dura.
Very good indeed .	Baayyee gaarii dha dhuguma .
What a nice sight.	Maal namatti tola.
I don’t know how you do it.	Akkamitti akka gootu hin beeku.
And and and.	Fi fi fi.
I didn’t mean any of it.	Isa keessaa tokkollee jechuu koo hin turre.
But not, you know, not often.	Garuu miti, beekta, yeroo baayyee miti.
No one knew his real name.	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa namni beeku hin turre.
Not much in the past year.	Waggaa darbe keessa baay'ee miti.
She’s been up there for a year now.	Amma waggaa tokko achi ol turte.
He knew that feeling only too well by now.	Miira sana yeroo ammaatti akka gaariitti qofa beeka ture.
I got out of it.	Anis keessaa ba'e.
No one could have lived there before then.	Yeroo sanatti namni tokkollee duraan achi jiraachuu hin danda'u ture.
You can’t live with this feeling.	Miira kanaan jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
Well done!	Gaarii goote!
But that’s not right.	Garuu sun sirrii miti.
There are even right ones.	Sirrii illee ni jiru.
It was inside me.	Keessa koo ture.
But that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t.	Garuu jechuun hin qabu jechuu miti.
I just have to do it.	Ani qofa gochuu qaba.
Now it's just you and me.	Amma ana fi si qofa.
It was more than that.	Caalaatti ture.
Just last year, it was.	Bara darbe qofa, akkas ture.
He is a human being.	Inni nama.
I say it won't happen.	Hin ta'u nan jedha.
I don't want to see this.	Kana arguu hin barbaadu.
What a mouthful.	Maal afaan qaba.
One.	Tokko.
His hand on my arm.	Harka isaa harka koo irratti.
I thought that's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba jedheen yaade.
These are the.	Isaan kun kan.
Maybe a little too much.	Tarii xiqqoo garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
That would have been the case.	Silaa akkas ta'a.
I knew you.	Si beeka ture.
What should we do about this?	Kana maal gochuu qabna?
He still didn’t know me.	Ammallee na hin beeku ture.
You were good.	Ati gaarii turte.
Everything has a time and a place.	Wanti hundi yeroo fi bakka qaba.
What should that do.	Sun maal gochuu qaba.
You can see that in his work.	Hojii isaa irratti sana arguu dandeessu.
No one else seemed to get it.	Namni biraa waan argate hin fakkaatu ture.
We didn’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabnu turre.
He had to see the truth.	Dhugaa jiru arguu qaba ture.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Ani qofa amanuu hin dandeenye.
I go to my work.	Hojii kootti nan deema.
He knows that it is not.	Akka hin taane ni beeka.
This was all in the works, but it took time.	Kun hundi hojii keessa ture, garuu yeroo fudhate.
But that’s not the case anymore.	Garuu kana booda akkas miti.
It seemed like such a good idea.	Yaada gaarii akkasii fakkaata ture.
If so, then so be it.	Yoo akkas ta'e akkas ta'a.
But it's not very perfect.	Garuu baay'ee guutuu miti.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Namni hundi waa'ee isaa dubbachuu barbaada.
We agreed with him.	Isa irratti walii galle.
He hadn’t told anyone.	Namatti hin himne ture.
He has a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee qaba.
But that’s not exactly true.	Garuu sun sirriitti dhugaa miti.
It still looks good.	Ammas gaarii fakkaata.
He didn’t love his father.	Abbaa isaa hin jaallatu ture.
Someone else about.	Namni biraa waa'ee.
What happens, happens.	Wanti ta'u, ni ta'a.
Everyone has a car.	Namni hundi konkolaataa qaba.
But wait an hour.	Garuu sa'aatii tokko eegaa.
They are on it.	Isa irra jiru.
But she wasn't a complete adult either.	Garuu isheen illee guutummaatti nama guddaa hin turre.
I don't know how, but he's there.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu inni jira.
It’s not even an answer.	Deebii illee miti.
But he did his duty.	Garuu dirqama isaa ba'e.
So they tell me.	Kanaaf natti himu.
But you don't.	Garuu hin gootu.
He had to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qaba ture.
He said a lot of things were true.	Waan baay'een dhugaa akka ta'e dubbateera.
Not for long.	Yeroo dheeraa miti.
I have to say.	Jechuun qaba.
But he couldn't say that.	Garuu akkas jechuu hin dandeenye.
So he had to be nothing.	Kanaaf inni homaa hin taane taʼuu qaba ture.
The handle of my hand.	Qabduu harka koo.
Much more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee.
That’s what happened in this case.	Dhimma kana keessatti kan ta’e kanuma.
It seemed so obvious now.	Amma akkas ifa fakkaata ture.
But I want to say this.	Ani garuu kana jechuu barbaada.
I was, like, we thought about this whole thing.	Ani ture, akka, waan kana hunda yaadne.
That seems to be out now.	Sun amma waan ba'e fakkaata.
That's what happens here.	Asitti akkas ta'a.
But it works really well.	Garuu dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
That’s not entirely accurate.	Sun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
This shouldn't be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu.
It’s working for us.	Nuuf hojjechaa jira.
I need a little bit.	Xiqqoo na barbaachisa.
Now is your time to make one.	Yeroon keessan tokko hojjechuuf amma.
He should never know.	Inni gonkumaa beekuu hin qabu.
Not really.	Dhuguma miti.
All those people had to go somewhere.	Namoonni sun hundi bakka tokko deemuu qabu turan.
But then she was gone.	Sana booda garuu isheen hin jirre.
He asked me for money.	Maallaqa na gaafate.
That's what's most important.	Kan hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma.
I still did not know why.	Ammallee maaliif akka taʼe hin beeku ture.
There is only one problem.	Rakkoon jiru tokko qofa.
I still had a lot, in those days.	Ammallee baay'een qaba ture, bara sanatti.
The language is clear.	Afaan ifaadha.
This was not the way.	Kun karaa hin turre.
This is not a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii miti.
It’s a mistake.	Dogoggora dha.
I absolutely think he can.	Ani guutummaatti akka danda'u natti fakkaata.
It's wrong to say it has to be here.	Asitti ta'uu qaba jechuun dogoggora.
Is this what you want.	Kan ati barbaaddu kana moo.
Again, everything went well.	Ammas wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deeme.
You never have it.	Ati gonkumaa hin qabdu.
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
Of course, they weren’t.	Kan beekamaadha, isaan hin turre.
But she did just that.	Isheen garuu akkas goote.
You have to stay.	Turuu qabda.
It was in those days.	Bara sana ture.
He had no answer.	Deebii tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Of course, this was not easy.	Kun salphaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
Not bad, just not very good.	Hamaa miti, baayyee gaarii miti qofa.
He was good at a lot.	Baayyee irratti ga'umsa qaba ture.
I'm just so glad I got the chance.	Carraa argachuu kootti baay'een gammade qofa.
People know me.	Namoonni na beeku.
It was a lot.	Baay'ee ture.
Usually not after that.	Yeroo baay'ee sana booda miti.
You know his voice.	Sagalee isaa ni beekta.
Which was something.	Kan waan tokko ture.
But you know .	Garuu beekta .
Everything you have in the house.	Waan mana keessa qabdu hunda.
It can be really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
Excessive problems.	Rakkoo garmalee.
It works both ways.	Karaa lamaan hojjeta.
I seriously love this stuff!.	Ani akka malee waan kana baay'een jaalladha!.
That's how it happened.	Akkasitti ta'e.
I need my friends.	Hiriyyoota koo na barbaachisa.
He wasn't there.	Achitti hin turre.
Then it becomes reality.	Sana booda dhugaa ta'a.
They have to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabu.
He didn't have time.	Yeroo hin qabu ture.
They are not his.	Isaan kan isaa miti.
They are his ideas, not mine.	Isaan yaada isaa malee kan koo miti.
We need a new location.	Bakka haaraa nu barbaachisa.
They had to do something new.	Waan haaraa hojjechuu qabu turan.
He wanted another but thought more about it.	Kan biraa barbaade garuu kana caalaa itti yaade.
That’s what everyone here is doing.	Asitti namni hundi kanuma gochaa jiru.
Otherwise it’s not a sound.	Yoo kana hin taane sagalee miti.
They looked at each other for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf wal ilaalaa turan.
We’ve been here our whole lives.	Jireenya keenya guutuu as turre.
Even in one room.	Kutaa tokko keessatti illee.
A lot of things are clear to me.	Waan baay'een naaf ifaadha.
I don't mean to be.	Ta'uu jechuu koo miti.
He did so on his own, no one told him.	Ofii isaatiin akkas godhe, namni itti hime hin jiru.
We have it, we’re here.	Qabna, as jirra.
So when did you do it.	Kanaaf yoom goote.
Tell me you love me.	Akka na jaallattu natti himi.
He didn’t do two.	Lama hin goone.
He has everything he needs to know.	Waan beekuu qabu hunda qaba.
It does everything you can think of.	Waan ati yaaddu hunda ni hojjeta.
He was fine apparently.	Inni gaarii ture fakkaata.
Take a good look at your surroundings.	Naannoo keessan akka gaariitti ilaalaa.
He is.	Inni ... dha.
Then he went away.	Sana booda deeme.
Maybe a year later.	Tarii waggaa booda.
She was in it once she was in it.	Yeroo tokko keessa turte keessa turte.
But tell me this.	Garuu kana natti himi.
I don’t have it.	Hin qabu.
That’s how language started.	Afaan akkasitti jalqabe.
He was hers.	Inni kan ishee ture.
It’s not just kids anymore.	Kana booda ijoollee qofa miti.
That night.	Halkan sana.
This couldn’t be my reality.	Kun dhugaa koo ta’uu hin dandeenye.
That’s all we can do.	Kana qofa gochuu dandeenyu.
No one really knows what happened.	Waan ta'e dhuguma namni beeku hin jiru.
To us, that seems simple.	Nuuf sun salphaa fakkaata.
He wasn’t like that anymore.	Inni kana booda akkas hin turre.
I came here yesterday.	Kaleessa as dhufe.
It's nothing like that, it wouldn't happen.	Waan akkasii miti, hin ta'u ture.
But they have a simple one.	Garuu kan salphaa qabu.
This is not our opinion.	Kun yaada keenya miti.
But there was no time at the time.	Garuu yeroo sanatti yeroon hin turre.
But it wasn’t good.	Garuu gaarii hin turre.
She had to be somewhere else.	Bakka biraa ta'uu qabdi turte.
I have two other things for you.	Waan biraa lama siif qaba.
He thinks	Inni ni yaada .
I told him something but it wasn’t true.	Ani waan tokko itti hime malee dhugaa hin taane.
All of this is well known.	Kun hundi beekamaadha.
And I'm sorry.	Ani ana.
She was wrong.	Isheen dogoggora turte.
I had no idea what was ahead of me.	Waan na dura jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
This was enough.	Kun gahaa ture.
They wouldn’t care.	Silaa dhimma hin qaban turan.
We needed that.	Sana nu barbaachisa ture.
Getting lots of ideas.	Yaada baay'ee argachuu.
There’s really nothing we can do about it.	Dhuguma wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
But it could have been so much more.	Garuu kana caalaa waan baay'ee qabaachuu danda'a ture.
Only three of them.	Isaan keessaa sadii qofa.
All of this can be yours.	Kun hundi kan kee ta’uu danda’a.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
I got a question.	Gaaffii naaf dhufe.
You’re one of those.	Sana keessaa ati.
There were a lot of people in there.	Achi keessa namoonni baay'een turan.
He just told the truth.	Dhugaa jiru qofa dubbate.
That was good enough.	Sun gaarii ture.
I'm not doing very well today.	Har'a baayyee gaarii hin jiru.
I have been there once.	Yeroo tokko achi tureera.
That doesn't seem to be the case today.	Sun har'a waan ta'e hin fakkaatu.
He didn't know what to say.	Waan jedhu hin beekne.
He didn't say much to me at all.	Tasumaa waan baay'ee natti hin dubbanne.
You had to be older.	Ati umuriin kee guddaa ta'uu qaba ture.
Someone who is relevant today may not be relevant tomorrow.	Namni har’a barbaachisaa ta’e boru barbaachisaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I thought you were right there.	Ati sirriitti achi jirta jedheen yaade.
It wasn’t that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura hin turre.
They had to do what they had to do.	Waan gochuu qaban gochuu qabu turan.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
I really don’t want to know.	Dhuguma beekuu hin barbaadu.
Look at those two men.	Namoota lamaan sana ilaalaa.
He’s not going to do anything.	Inni homaa gochuuf hin deemu.
That looked pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
He didn't speak for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa hin dubbanne.
I just didn’t agree with it.	Ani qofa irratti walii hin galle.
I am with you.	Ani isin waliin jira.
I like his wife better.	Haadha manaa isaa caalaatti natti tola.
You don’t want any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaaddu.
How much money do you have?	Maallaqa meeqa qabda?
It was always my favorite time of day.	Yeroo hundumaa guyyaa keessatti yeroo ani baay'ee jaalladhu ture.
It still doesn’t work.	Ammallee hin hojjetu.
Once, someone recognized me.	Yeroo tokko, namni tokko na beeku.
We have to be on it.	Isa irra ta'uu qabna.
You don't care.	Ati dhimma hin qabdu.
Now she was inside.	Amma isheen keessa turte.
This is not working.	Kun hojjechaa hin jiru.
He certainly wasn’t really in any danger.	Dhuguma balaa tokkollee keessa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
Didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beekne.
It was a great picture.	Suuraa guddaa ture.
One chance, perhaps.	Carraa tokko, tarii.
It was just me.	Ana qofa ture.
We did a lot of things together.	Waan hedduu waliin hojjenne.
Such people should not be around.	Namoonni akkasii naannoo sana jiraachuu hin qaban.
This is very important.	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
It wasn’t a great room.	Kutaa guddaa hin turre.
Her mouth still wasn't where it should be.	Afaan ishee ammallee bakka itti ta'uu qabu hin turre.
It must be unique.	Adda ta’uu qaba.
Who was it.	Eenyu ture.
I said now.	jedheen amma.
She didn't know why he would do such a thing.	Waan akkasii maaliif akka hojjetu hin beektu turte.
I don't know anymore.	Kana booda hin beeku.
I'm sure there's more.	Kana caalaa akka jiru mirkanaa'adha.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
It wasn't good.	Gaarii hin turre.
It was in the morning.	Ganama ture.
I don't know if that's what you need.	Wanti si barbaachisu sun ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
She was joking.	Isheen qoosaa turte.
I wondered what else they wanted.	Kan biraa maal barbaadu jedheen yaade.
You know what that sounds like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu beekta.
She never became like that.	Isheen gonkumaa akkas ta'e.
Except that they are not.	Isaan akka hin taane malee.
It’s not just this one.	Isa kana qofa miti.
He has something.	Waan tokko qaba.
That was just a few weeks ago.	Sun torban muraasa dura qofa ture.
It must be a house.	Mana ta'uu qaba.
He took his hand from hers.	Harka isaa harka ishee irraa fudhate.
It really doesn’t matter.	Dhuguma homaa hin qabu.
I thought it was just one girl.	Intala tokko qofa natti fakkaate.
It was today.	Har'a turte.
He asked him about his hands.	Waa'ee harka isaa isa gaafate.
In this case, the person.	Dhimma kana irratti nama.
This is not a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa miti.
Like I said, it wasn’t like that.	Akkuma jedhe akkas hin turre.
But this feeling.	Garuu miira kana.
He said once.	Yeroo tokko jedhe.
But we have to go.	Garuu deemuu qabna.
I think this will be another positive for him.	Kun isaaf waan gaarii biraa ta'a jedheen yaada.
Now I know why.	Amma maaliif akka ta'e beeka.
You shouldn’t do that.	Akkas gochuu hin qabdu.
Something is going to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf deema.
Things were uncertain.	Wanti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But he already knew.	Garuu inni duruu beeka ture.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
Who knows, you might get lucky soon.	Eenyu beeka yeroo dhiyootti carraa argachuu dandeessa.
I’ve never been a lonely person here.	Nama kophaa isaa as turee hin beeku.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
But he still couldn’t do it.	Garuu ammallee gochuu hin dandeenye.
He wasn't so sure.	Inni hangas mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It's right here.	Sirriitti as jira.
They are no longer children.	Kana booda ijoollee miti.
Do you have any important questions?	Gaaffii barbaachisaa ta'e qabduu?
Which was probably good.	Kan tarii gaarii ture.
That’s of course.	Sun beekamaadha.
Tell me, though.	Natti himi garuu.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
People want answers.	Namoonni deebii barbaadu.
I didn’t see them.	Isaan hin argine.
You know how it goes.	Akkamitti akka deemu beekta.
It’s an idea.	Yaada dha.
It's never happened before.	Kanaan dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
We can’t leave him.	Isa dhiisuu hin dandeenyu.
Love your life and love yourself.	Jireenya kee jaalladhu of jaalladhu.
I didn't go.	Ani hin deemne.
A while passed.	Yeroon tokko darbe.
I couldn’t do that to them.	Ani akkas isaan gochuu hin dandeenye.
You know who he is.	Eenyu akka ta'e ni beekta.
No more questions!	Kana booda gaaffii hin qabu!
I want to be a guy.	Ani gurbaa ta'uu barbaada.
It didn't matter why.	Maaliif akka ta'e homaa hin turre.
But he really didn’t have time.	Dhuguma garuu yeroo hin qabu ture.
But he doesn't want me.	Garuu na hin barbaadu.
You may have to buy something new.	Waan haaraa bitachuu qabda taʼa.
She didn't understand anything.	Isheen homaa hin hubanne.
People do that.	Namoonni akkas godhu.
This took a long time to happen.	Kun ta'uuf yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
But that’s wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora.
But that wasn’t their only problem.	Sun garuu rakkoo isaanii qofa hin turre.
He looked so different.	Inni baayyee adda fakkaata ture.
She was his favourite.	Isheen kan inni jaallattu turte.
But it's nothing.	Garuu homaa miti.
He didn’t do something the right way.	Waan tokko karaa sirrii hin hojjenne.
But he wasn’t alone.	Garuu kophaa isaa hin turre.
It’s obvious.	Ifaadha.
They knew each other.	Wal beeku turan.
That's very problematic.	Sun baayyee rakkoo qaba.
It was the only answer he could give.	Deebii inni kennuu danda'u qofa ture.
They love children.	Ijoollee ni jaallatu.
Now she had none of those things.	Amma wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
No one said that happened.	Namni akkas ta'e jedhe hin jiru.
Sometimes it works well.	Yeroo tokko tokko akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I want to stay clear.	Ifa ta'ee turuu barbaada.
He looked at his watch.	Sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
It wasn’t any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee hin turre.
We’re just friends.	Nuti hiriyyoota qofa.
There was a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni ture.
Truth, not opinion.	Dhugaa, yaada miti.
Go back again.	Ammas duubatti deebi'i.
Maybe he wasn't my real father.	Tarii inni abbaa koo isa dhugaa hin turre ta'a.
I don’t think she even knows.	Isheen illee waan beektu natti hin fakkaatu.
But that’s what you love about it.	Garuu waan ati itti jaallattu kanuma.
That's what she said.	Kana jette.
That’s why it was.	Kanaaf ture.
This is your school.	Kun mana barumsaa keessan.
Maybe you know me.	Tarii na beektu ta'a.
I wish it weren't.	Osoo osoo hin taane natti tola.
One of us had to go.	Tokko keenya deemuun dirqama ture.
He loved many people.	Namoota baayʼee ni jaallata ture.
But they do worse.	Garuu kana caalaa hamaa hojjetu.
A lot of people are just waiting around.	Namoonni baay'een naannoo qofa eegaa jiru.
Everything that could happen usually happened.	Wanti taʼuu dandaʼu hundi yeroo baayʼee ni taʼa ture.
This seemed to be more about the cat.	Kun waa'ee saree caalaa waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
But there is no one else.	Garuu namni biraa hin jiru.
But I think it’s more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa natti fakkaata.
Of course, this never happens.	Kun gonkumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Not well enough.	Akka gaariitti gahaa miti.
He was always a good guy.	Yeroo hundumaa nama gaarii ture.
Maybe it's something else.	Tarii waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
We have friends.	Hiriyyoota qabna.
I know it will happen.	Akka ta'u nan beeka.
. . . .	.
You don’t, you haven’t for a long time.	Hin gootu, yeroo dheeraaf hin qabdu.
By then it was night.	Yeroo sanatti halkan ta'e.
Couldn't answer, of course.	Deebii kennuu hin dandeenye, beekamaadha.
I certainly didn’t.	Ani akkan hin goone beekamaadha.
You know many people.	Namoota hedduu ni beektu.
She was one of them.	Isheen tokko turte.
I think that’s good.	Sun gaarii natti fakkaata.
I was doing that.	Ani akkas gochaa ture.
We need to help.	Gargaaruu qabna.
I want him to go away.	Akka inni deemu nan barbaada.
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
We still had work to do.	Ammallee hojii hojjechuu qabnu qabna turre.
I think it’s too dangerous.	Garmalee balaa qaba jedheen yaada.
We’re not the only ones.	Nu qofa miti.
We went on the road.	Karaa irra deemne.
That's how you'll be.	Akkas ta'a isin.
This was a good time.	Yeroon kun yeroo gaarii ture.
You know, it was a big mistake.	Beektaa dogoggora guddaa ture.
I started to get the bigger picture.	Suuraa guddaa sana argachuu jalqabe.
This is not a problem at all.	Kun tasumaa rakkoon hin jiru.
It was a good afternoon.	Waaree booda yeroo gaarii ture.
He wants to be the only person who can find him.	Nama isa argachuu danda'u qofa ta'uu barbaada.
We're looking for something that shouldn't be here.	Waan as ta'uu hin qabne barbaadaa jirra.
I really have no way of telling.	Dhuguma karaa itti himu hin qabu.
So that’s not the problem.	Kanaaf rakkoon jiru kanuma miti.
I am not your light.	Ani ifa kee miti.
There will be.	Ni jiraata.
Now look at me.	Amma na ilaalaa.
I am not a human being.	Ani nama miti.
I must be going.	Ani deemaa jiraachuu qaba.
It wasn’t a job.	Hojii hin turre.
That was his only way.	Sun karaa isaa qofa ture.
We have to be together.	Waliin ta'uu qabna.
Take a look!.	Mee ilaalaa!.
He absolutely would.	Inni guutummaatti ni godha ture.
But he had nothing to do.	Garuu waan hojjetu hin qabu ture.
Sometimes they do.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni godhu.
Mine is not such a case.	Kan koo dhimma akkasii miti.
My very bad.	Baayyee hamaa koo.
I won’t go any further with you now.	Amma si waliin kana caalaa hin deemu.
It's pretty obvious why.	Maaliif akka ta'e baay'ee ifaadha.
Just not right now.	Yeroo ammaa miti qofa.
I still wasn't sure about that.	Ammallee waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I don’t understand any of it.	Isa keessaa tokkollee naaf hin galle.
It’s dangerous.	Balaa qaba.
She still didn’t know.	Ammallee hin beektu turte.
We’ve been here a long, long time.	Yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa as turre.
In the room.	Kutaa keessatti.
He told me we could be on our way.	Karaa irra jiraachuu akka dandeenyu natti hime.
By then it will be too late.	Yeroo sanatti yeroon isaa baayʼee booda taʼa.
I only have you.	Si qofa qaba.
I couldn't leave it.	Dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t want that to happen in my book.	Kitaaba koo irratti akkas akka ta’u hin barbaanne.
Probably not,' she said.	Tarii hin ta'u,' jette.
That wouldn’t help the situation.	Sun haala jiru hin gargaaru ture.
It just doesn’t exist here.	Asitti hin jiru qofa.
I have three dogs.	Saree sadii qaba.
It is doing very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jira.
But the problem was still there.	Garuu rakkoon sun ammallee achi ture.
Someone else began to speak over him.	Isa irra namni biraa dubbachuu jalqabe.
It's never going to be with me.	Gonkumaa na waliin ta'uuf hin deemu.
But they are looking for a way.	Garuu karaa barbaadaa jiru.
We’re doing everything right here.	Asitti waan hunda sirriitti hojjechaa jirra.
I don’t want to be with you anymore.	Kana booda si waliin jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
We went to his house.	Mana isaa deemne.
I know everyone will tell you this, but it really has to happen.	Kana namni hundi akka sitti himu nan beeka, garuu dhuguma ta'uu qaba.
This is something new.	Kun waan haaraa dha.
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
That seems not to be a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii hin taane fakkaata.
I didn’t work with him.	Isa waliin hin hojjenne.
I hope you do that.	Akkas akka gootu abdiin qaba.
Not from her eyes.	Ija ishee irraa miti.
You can’t live there now.	Amma achi jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
I didn’t talk to them.	Isaan waliin hin dubbanne.
I'm sure that's the case.	Akkas akka ta'e mirkanaa'adha.
I think it’s important.	Barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
It should be perfectly fine now.	Amma guutummaatti sirriitti ta'uu qaba.
It was none of her business.	Dhimma ishee tokkollee hin turre.
No more is needed.	Kana caalaa hin barbaachisu.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I knew it was him.	Isa akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
But that wasn’t always easy.	Garuu yeroo hunda sun salphaa hin turre.
That’s how it’s always been.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
That doesn't happen on my watch.	Sa'aatii koo irratti sun hin ta'u.
Why did it happen.	Maaliif akkas ta'e.
You’re a good one.	Ati gaarii dha.
There is nothing he has to do.	Waan gochuu qabu hin jiru.
It’s loud out here.	As ala sagalee guddaa dha.
They were real.	Isaan dhugaa turan.
It’s working for me.	Naaf hojjechaa jira.
This isn't about them.	Kun waa'ee isaanii miti.
But that’s not the worst part.	Garuu sun waan hunda caalaa hamaa miti.
Now he was interested.	Amma fedhii qaba ture.
He should buy one.	Tokko bitachuu qaba.
You don’t have to say anything now.	Amma homaa jechuu hin qabdu.
Who had it.	Eenyu qaba ture.
People often think that way.	Namoonni yeroo baayʼee akkasitti yaadu.
I didn’t understand what the problem could be.	Rakkoon jiru maal ta’uu akka danda’u naaf hin galle.
If that is the only hope, there is no hope.	Abdiin sun qofa yoo ta'e abdiin hin jiru.
I want to say it was our time.	Yeroon keenya ture jechuu barbaada.
I didn’t want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne.
It was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture.
But he had no new ones.	Garuu haaraa hin qabu ture.
But it's one thing.	Garuu waan tokko.
But it must be.	Garuu ta'uu qaba.
He loves me.	Inni na jaallata.
I was in school at the time.	Yeroo sanatti mana barumsaa ture.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
The easiest one.	Kan salphaa ta'e.
I was that kind of girl.	Ani intala akkasii ture.
You have no interest in me.	Naaf fedhii hin qabdu.
It was a great time in life.	Jireenya keessatti yeroo guddaa ture.
I don’t want any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaadu.
This was not the case not like me.	Kun akkas hin turre akka koo miti.
There's almost nothing we can do about it.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru jechuun ni danda'ama.
None of them said a thing.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan tokko hin dubbanne.
Who was she? 	Isheen eenyu turte?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I am right, again.	Ani sirrii dha, ammas.
Where are you.	Eessa jirta.
But they don’t have to know that.	Garuu sana beekuu hin qaban.
I really like yours.	Kan keessan baayyee natti tola.
I know he did it for me.	Akka naaf godhe nan beeka.
This isn't about me.	Kun waa'ee koo miti.
He looked into his eyes again.	Ammas ija isaa keessa ilaale.
Tom looked around.	Toomin naannoo isaa ilaale.
I don't need it.	Na hin barbaachisu.
He told her he didn’t know anything like that.	Waan akkasii akka hin beekne itti hime.
Which isn’t so bad.	Kan akkas hamaa hin taane.
He is on my way.	Inni karaa koo irra jira.
He came with me.	Ana waliin dhufe.
You just have to give space.	Bakka kennuu qofa qabda.
I didn’t really understand.	Dhuguma hin hubanne.
It's probably nothing.	Homaa ta'uu hin oolu.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
Sooner is better than sooner.	Dafee caalaa dafee wayya.
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
I don’t do that right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana akkas hin godhu.
That was what he wanted.	Kan inni barbaade kanuma ture.
He only wants the best for me.	Inni waan gaarii qofa naaf barbaada.
It seemed like it lasted weeks.	Torban hedduu kan ture fakkaata ture.
I told myself you weren’t really important to me.	Anis akka ati dhuguma naaf hin barbaachifne ofitti hime.
It’s not that big of a deal.	Hojii guddaa hangas miti.
It's just the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ta'e qofa.
So they are not the same.	Kanaaf isaan tokko miti.
It’s not new.	Haaraa miti.
It seems easy.	Salphaa fakkaata.
I don't know.	Ani hin beeku.
Very few now.	Amma baayyee muraasa.
Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this.	Osoo akkas ta'ee kana hin godhu ture.
I think they can.	Ni danda'u jedheen yaada.
Not your husband.	Abbaa manaa kee miti.
So this is obvious.	Kanaaf kun beekamaadha.
It took an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko fudhate.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
If you don't know, you don't know.	Yoo hin beekne hin beeku.
I didn't think about her, he said.	Ani waa'ee ishee hin yaadne jedhe.
Why did he have to come?	Maaliif dhufuu qaba ture?
Not that they have relevant facts.	Dhugaa barbaachisaa ta'e qabu jechuu miti.
So they can have hope.	Kanaaf abdii qabaachuu danda'u.
She is my life, this is my life.	Isheen jireenya kooti, ​​kun jireenya kooti.
That might just be a little .	Sun tarii xiqqoo qofa ta'uu danda'a .
It happens often.	Yeroo baayyee ni ta'a.
It was a real household.	Manaa manaa dhugaa ture.
There is nowhere to go.	Bakka itti deemu hin jiru.
In this case.	Dhimma kana keessatti.
I don’t want her to leave.	Akka isheen deemtu hin barbaadu.
You have to do everything.	Waan hunda gochuu qabda.
But I can't know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'u garuu beekuu hin danda'u.
I know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu nan beeka.
Maybe though, he just doesn't know.	Tarii garuu, inni qofa hin beeku ta'a.
Maybe no one can help you.	Tarii namni si gargaaruu hin danda'u ta'a.
Even through and through.	Karaa fi karaa illee.
It was a nonsense.	Waan hin taane ture.
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
Few have names.	Maqaa qaban muraasa.
Not that it matters much.	Baay'ee dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
You have to work with me.	Ana waliin hojjechuu qabda.
They love being together.	Waliin ta'uu ni jaallatu.
I'm not doing much right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana waan baay'ee hojjechaa hin jiru.
That was never good enough.	Sun gonkumaa gaarii hin turre.
We need more people like him.	Namoota akka isaa baay'ee nu barbaachisa.
It was fine after two in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii lama booda gaarii ture.
Everyone should play this.	Namni hundi kana taphachuu qaba.
They’ll be in every class.	Kutaa hunda keessatti ni ta’u.
Repeat this three times.	Kana yeroo sadii irra deebi’i.
He doesn’t look good.	Inni gaarii hin fakkaatu.
I really didn’t know what to do.	Dhuguma maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
It didn't do anything to him.	Homaa isa hin goone.
Not in this house he doesn’t.	Mana kana keessatti miti inni hin godhu.
But it's usually not that bad.	Garuu yeroo baayyee hangas hamaa miti.
We are that one.	Nuti isa sana.
I couldn’t afford a new car.	Konkolaataa haaraa bitachuu hin dandeenye.
I have nothing now.	Amma homaa hin qabu.
I would like your opinion on that.	Sana irratti yaada keessan nan barbaada.
But then.	Garuu yeroo sana.
That may be true.	Sun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
He was completely one with them.	Guutummaatti isaan waliin tokko ture.
There is nothing for me here.	Asitti wanti naaf ta'u hin jiru.
It could have been a sleepless night.	Silaa halkan hirriba hin qabne ta'uu danda'a.
Most of what should be right is mostly wrong.	Irra caalaa sirrii ta’uu qabu irra caalaa sirrii miti.
You don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabdu.
Accident, no problem.	Balaa, rakkoo hin qabu.
Not much, but some.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane tokko tokko.
No sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa hin qabu.
He didn’t really speak.	Dhuguma hin dubbanne.
It’s my opinion.	Yaada kooti.
But no one answered.	Garuu namni deebii kenne hin jiru.
He was just different.	Inni adda qofa ture.
I didn't even understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e illee hin hubanne.
Probably better than hers.	Tarii kan ishee caalaa gaarii dha.
Just as well, really.	Akkuma gaarii, dhuguma.
It was for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ture.
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii dha.
It’s still working.	Ammallee hojjechaa jira.
None of them could help him.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee isa gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I don’t know how to tell him.	Akkamitti akkan itti himu hin beeku.
There is no one he can tell about it.	Waa'ee kanaa namni inni itti himuu danda'u hin jiru.
But really.	Garuu dhuguma.
So let me just say we have two suggestions.	Kanaaf mee yaada lama qabna jechuu qofa.
I started helping myself.	Of gargaaruu jalqabe.
He said he'd rather not.	Osoo hin taane wayya jedhe.
It’s not you.	Ati miti.
We cannot live without food.	Nyaata malee jiraachuu hin dandeenyu.
That’s what he has.	Kan inni qabu kanuma.
I mean, she obviously knows me.	Isheen akka na beektu ifaadha jechuu kooti.
I like this house.	Mana kana natti tola.
He thought we were friends.	Hiriyyoota akka taane itti fakkaate.
I love it that much.	Ani hangas nan jaalladha.
They had some of them for a while.	Isaan keessaa yeroo muraasaaf qaban.
I’m in one right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana tokko keessa jira.
I need it now.	Amma na barbaachisa.
I looked at her.	Anis ishee ilaale.
You know, things like shoes.	Beektaa, wantoota akka kophee.
There's a lot going on.	Waan baay'een itti deemaa jira.
We did the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjenne.
But he has no chance.	Garuu carraa hin qabu.
He was often not home at night.	Yeroo baay'ee halkan mana hin turre.
Good luck with the new comic.	Carraa gaarii qoosaa haaraa kanaaf.
That doesn't matter.	Sun homaa hin ta'u.
I don’t have it.	Ani hin qabu.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
They loved their children.	Ijoollee isaanii ni jaallatu turan.
So she would never go to the hospital.	Kanaaf gonkumaa mana yaalaa hin deemtu turte.
It wasn’t right at all.	Tasumaa sirriitti hin turre.
She has many names.	Maqaa hedduu qabdi.
He was evil.	Inni hamaa ture.
What happened, I'm glad it happened.	Wanti ta'e, ta'uu isaatti gammadeera.
But she didn't.	Isheen garuu hin goone.
They have nothing.	Homaa hin qaban.
Maybe it's just the two of them.	Tarii lamaan isaanii qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I am not a father.	Ani abbaa miti.
I don't want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaadu.
How long ago was that.	Yeroo meeqa dura ture sun.
They look so real.	Isaan akkas dhugaa fakkaatu.
But you don’t know you don’t.	Garuu hin beektu hin gootu.
I have to do this.	Kana gochuun qaba.
I think so.	Akkas jedheen yaada.
The person he is is nice.	Namni inni namatti tola.
But this would be fine.	Garuu kun gaarii ta'a.
That's why he says it.	Kanaaf jedha.
It’s really there for him.	Dhuguma isaaf jira.
Now it could be wrong.	Amma dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
You to forgive.	Ati dhiifama gochuuf.
I didn’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture.
She said again.	Jette ammas.
I didn’t really think about this.	Kana sirriitti hin yaadne.
This was enough.	Kun gahaa ture.
That’s not entirely a bad thing.	Sun guutummaatti waan hamaa miti.
On your doorstep.	Balbala kee irratti.
If he does.	Yoo godhe.
We should not dwell on this idea.	Yaada kana irratti turuu hin qabnu.
That's your reason!.	Sababni keessan kanuma!.
There is no one there.	Achitti namni hin jiru.
But she doesn’t look so good.	Garuu akkas gaarii hin fakkaattu.
That’s the only job.	Hojiin sun qofa.
He was always that kind of person.	Yeroo hundumaa nama akkasii ture.
Surely it mattered, he thought.	Dhimma akka qabu beekamaadha jedhee yaade.
But no one seemed to be able to tell me.	Garuu namni natti himuu danda'u hin fakkaatu ture.
But something seemed wrong.	Garuu wanti tokko dogoggora fakkaata ture.
Environment and environment.	Naannoo fi naannoo.
He had his mother.	Haadha isaa qaba ture.
The prospects are not good.	Abdiin jiru gaarii miti.
Like she knew him from somewhere.	Akkuma isheen bakka tokko irraa isa beektu.
I just have to believe it.	Ani amanuu qofa qaba.
All my desires.	Fedhii koo hunda.
I don't do that.	Ani akkas hin godhu.
Most people say three, but that's not true.	Namoonni baay'een sadii jedhu, garuu sun dhugaa miti.
I didn't know much about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan baay'ee hin beeku ture.
You could see this.	Kana arguu dandeessa turte.
They have a bad life.	Jireenya hamaa qabu.
I have been there many times.	Yeroo baay'ee achi tureera.
He was right about you.	Waa'ee kee sirrii ture.
Not on this.	Kana irratti miti.
That’s not a great question.	Sun gaaffii guddaa miti.
They love him very much.	Baay'ee isa jaallatu.
I don’t think he really meant it.	Dhuguma jechuu isaa natti hin fakkaatu.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
You have nowhere to go.	Bakka deemtu hin qabdu.
I have a lot of it.	Ani baay'ee qaba.
I knew them.	Ani isaan beeka ture.
It didn't matter.	Dhimma hin qabu ture.
I don't want to talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
He did everything he could.	Waan danda'u hunda godhe.
They should be pretty good.	Isaan baayyee gaarii ta'uu qabu.
He is acting like a gentleman.	Akka nama gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
They can help them.	Isaan gargaaruu dandaʼu.
We don’t have that situation here.	Asitti haala sana hin qabnu.
I know that you are.	Akka ati jirtu nan beeka.
It was her daughter.	Intala ishee ture.
That's not very long.	Sun baayyee dheeraa miti.
But it’s not that simple.	Garuu hangas salphaa miti.
We need to know what's going on there.	Waan achitti ta'aa jiru beekuu qabna.
He's pretty much the same.	Inni baayyee wal fakkaata.
But she hadn’t thought about it.	Garuu itti hin yaadne turte.
I don’t know how else to say this.	Kana biraa akkamitti akkan jedhu hin beeku.
It's mine.	Kan kooti.
Not sure he got the answer he wanted.	Deebii barbaade argachuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
It should stay that way.	Akkasitti turuu qaba.
Everything is fine, really.	Wanti hundi gaarii dha, dhuguma.
That was my bad.	Sun hamaa koo ture.
This has been mine.	Kun kan koo ta'ee jira.
This had to be a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta’uu qaba ture.
You have to see this.	Kana arguu qabda.
Someone was watching them.	Namni tokko isaan ilaalaa ture.
There was hope, but it was never clear where.	Abdiin jira ture, garuu eessa akka jiru ifa ta'ee hin beeku.
Maybe he does know.	Tarii ni beeka ta'a.
Always.	Yeroo hunda.
Where we need to go.	Bakka deemuun nu barbaachisu.
It was just like that.	Akkas qofa ture.
We can’t get good jobs.	Hojii gaarii argachuu hin dandeenyu.
We need your help.	Gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa.
You would know best.	Silaa hunda caalaa beekta.
You two can play again.	Isin lamaan ammas taphachuu dandeessu.
You still have a chance.	Ammallee carraan siif jira.
I know a few.	Muraasa beeka.
What do you do in our shoes?.	Kophee keenya keessa maal gootu?.
He may not want to know me.	Na beekuu hin barbaadu taʼa.
I’ve been in many of them, but it’s not the time.	Hedduu isaanii keessa ture, garuu yeroon isaa amma miti.
He could have gone.	Inni deemuu danda'a ture.
Why did this happen?	Kun maaliif ta'e?
Look at our situation.	Haala keenya ilaalaa.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
But that was not the most important thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe sun garuu hin turre.
He was truly one of us.	Dhuguma inni nu keessaa tokko ture.
I can't seem to get it to work properly.	Ani sirriitti akka hojjetu gochuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
We did that to both of our kids but they were much easier.	Ijoollee keenya lamaan irratti akkas goone garuu baayyee salphaa turan.
That’s going to be two.	Sun lama ta’a.
Just like he was.	Akkuma inni ture.
They can buy a new car.	Konkolaataa haaraa bitachuu danda'u.
I think he can do it again.	Ammas ni danda'a jedheen yaada.
I didn’t need to do anything that night.	Halkan sana homaa gochuun na hin barbaachisu ture.
This is not an easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa miti.
She was about three.	Gara sadii turte.
Everything that is going on.	Waan deemaa jiru hunda.
I said I could go.	Deemu danda'a jedheen.
This was often true.	Yeroo baayʼee kun dhugaa ture.
It comes from money but it doesn’t.	Maallaqa irraa dhufu malee hin dhufu.
Had to come back to it later.	Booda itti deebi'uu qaba ture.
It’s all still here.	Hundi isaa ammallee as jira.
You are right.	Ati sirrii dha.
Maybe they look like us.	Tarii akkuma keenya fakkaatu.
He loves it.	Inni ni jaallata.
Except for that one time .	Yeroo tokko sana malee .
This was not on them.	Kun isaan irra hin turre.
It could have been very different.	Silaa baayyee adda ta'uu danda'a ture.
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf.
But, not really.	Garuu, dhuguma miti.
Probably good, but I really didn't want him to go.	Tarii gaarii ta'uu hin oolu, garuu dhuguma akka inni deemu hin barbaanne.
In this case it is different than this time.	Haala kana keessatti yeroo kana irraa adda.
I knew what he liked.	Waan inni jaallatu nan beeka ture.
I never wanted to be.	Ani gonkumaa ta'uu hin barbaanne.
It may even backfire.	Duubatti deebi'uu illee danda'a.
He had only one question.	Gaaffii tokko qofa qaba ture.
But it was very nice.	Garuu baayyee namatti tola ture.
These are good though.	Isaan kun garuu gaarii dha.
This is not the case.	Kun miti.
Very glad it was one.	Tokko ta'uu isaatti baay'ee gammade.
Always, just this one time.	Yeroo hunda, yeroo tokko kana qofa.
She wasn’t like that at all.	Isheen tasumaa akkas hin turre.
Not that he ever did.	Inni gonkumaa akkas godhe miti.
That's all they'll be waiting for.	Kanuma qofa eegaa ta'u.
It came to my name.	Maqaa kootti dhufe.
He wants more than that.	Sana caalaa barbaada.
They need the money.	Maallaqa sana isaan barbaachisa.
I saw him here.	Asitti isa arge.
Now the timing never seemed right.	Amma yeroon sun gonkumaa sirrii hin fakkaatu ture.
You can really do it.	Dhuguma gochuu dandeessa.
When we were both human.	Yeroo lamaan keenya nama turre.
But better late than never.	Garuu gonkumaa osoo hin taane yeroon booda wayya.
Lots and lots of girls.	Intala baay'ee fi baay'ee.
It happens very rarely.	Baayyee yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
He often had other ideas.	Yeroo baayʼee yaada kan biraa qaba ture.
Check it out in two hours.	Sa'aatii lama booda ilaalaa.
I don’t understand why not.	Maaliif akka hin taane naaf hin galle.
But this is important.	Garuu kun barbaachisaa dha.
My husband, my husband.	Abbaa manaa koo.
But something has to happen.	Garuu wanti tokko ta'uu qaba.
Just a year ago today.	Waggaa tokko dura qofa har'a.
Look at the look.	Ilaalaa ilaalaa.
I think everyone knows this.	Kana namni hundi waan beeku natti fakkaata.
This is not necessary.	Kun hin barbaachisu.
But that’s a good thing.	Garuu sun waan gaarii dha.
Then he started.	Sana booda jalqabe.
That was what they were doing.	Sun waan isaan hojjechaa turan ture.
I didn’t agree with them.	Isaan irratti walii hin galle.
This is my guy.	Kun gurbaa kooti.
You never know how something is going to turn out.	Wanti tokko akkamitti akka ta'uuf deemu gonkumaa hin beektu.
We talked a little bit.	Xiqqoo dubbanne.
It wasn't where you needed to be.	Bakka ta'uu qabdu hin turre.
They hadn't spoken much that morning.	Ganama sana baay'ee hin dubbanne turan.
He looked at her again.	Ammas gara ishee ilaale.
It's going to be a long night.	Halkan dheeraa ta'uuf jira.
You’re doing everything you can to help them.	Isaan gargaaruuf waan dandeessu hunda gochaa jirta.
But this was only a theory.	Kun garuu yaada qofa ture.
Today, that is.	Har’a jechuun.
Not so good.	Akkas gaarii miti.
He didn’t have time for it.	Yeroo itti hin qabu ture.
He’s just a human being.	Inni nama qofa.
I need to do this for me.	Kana naaf gochuun na barbaachisa.
Everything is working fine after that.	Sana booda wanti hundi akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
I could have done without that.	Silaa sana malee gochuu nan danda'a ture.
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
I was looking for something.	Waan tokko barbaadaa ture.
It wasn’t a lot of money, but it was then.	Maallaqa guddaa hin turre, garuu yeroo sana ture.
He spoke without emotion.	Miira malee dubbate.
But it still has its place.	Garuu ammallee bakka isaa qaba.
That little bit was good.	Xiqqoo sun gaarii ture.
I don’t even know what that was.	Sun maal akka ture illee hin beeku.
But only for a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
But I couldn’t find one.	Garuu tokko argachuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe you should do it.	Tarii gochuu qabda ta'a.
Now, he knew it.	Amma, ni beeka ture.
But maybe not.	Garuu tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
Then he saw her.	Sana booda ishee arge.
He’s not a funny guy.	Inni nama qoosaa miti.
It’s not a good thing.	Waan gaarii miti.
That should do it.	Sun gochuu qaba.
How could that be?	Akkamitti akkas taʼuu dandaʼa?
This problem is becoming a serious threat.	Rakkoon kun balaa hamaa ta'aa jira.
You are.	Ati ...dha.
It's never been an issue.	Dhimma ta'ee hin beeku.
Probably my favorite thing ever.	Tarii waan ani yoomiyyuu jaalladhu ta'uu danda'a.
This is my life.	Kun jireenya kooti.
He watched her walk down the street.	Karaa irra yeroo deemtu ilaale.
That’s the only reality.	Dhugaa jiru kana qofa.
Something would have to happen.	Silaa waan tokko ta'uu qaba ture.
If it’s not night yet, wait.	Yoo ammallee halkan hin taane eegaa.
I look for another way.	Karaa biraa nan barbaada.
I’m not doing any work.	Hojii tokkollee hojjechaa hin jiru.
Couldn't find anything on it.	Irratti homaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
What a problem nothing happened.	Maal rakkoo homaa hin taane.
I'm just eating.	Ani nyaata qofa.
I never wanted him to.	Ani gonkumaa akka inni godhu hin barbaanne.
No homework required.	Hojiin manaa hin barbaachisu.
I wish that were the case.	Osoo akkas ta'ee natti tola.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I know it works great.	Guddaa akka hojjetu nan beeka.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Garuu namni maal akka itti godhu hin beeku ture.
It's time to get back on track.	Yeroon karaa irra deebi'uu amma.
Look around us.	Naannoo keenya ilaalaa.
They will do their job.	Hojii isaanii ni hojjetu.
Not very good on the hands.	Harka irratti baayyee gaarii miti.
It was like my home.	Akka mana kooti ture.
It made him special.	Adda isa godhe.
It wasn’t his favorite part.	Kutaa inni jaallatu hin turre.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
Just one bad day.	Guyyaa hamaa tokko qofa.
People know us.	Namoonni nu beeku.
I don’t know what to do here.	Asitti maal gochuu akka qabu hin beeku.
She was still outside.	Ammallee ala turte.
We still can’t do that.	Ammallee akkas gochuu hin dandeenyu.
Now she was with them too.	Amma isheen illee isaan bira turte.
It could even be you.	Si illee ta'uu danda'a.
It shouldn't have happened.	Silaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I can't quite say.	Ani guutummaatti jechuu hin danda'u.
Still not a hand.	Ammas harka miti.
. . . .	.
So he will do that today.	Kanaaf har'a akkas ni godha.
Just to be clear.	Ifa ta'uuf qofa.
Everyone here knows it.	Namni as jiru hundi ni beeka.
You have the time.	Yeroo qabdu.
He had to earn his living.	Jireenya isaa argachuu qaba ture.
I thought as much.	Anis hamma sana yaade.
They have no problems.	Isaan rakkoo hin qaban.
They have no problems.	Isaan rakkoo hin qaban.
If you don’t, you won’t.	Yoo hin taane hin gootu.
You don’t need anything else.	Waan biraa si hin barbaachisu.
When do you want this?	Kana yoom barbaaddu?
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
I don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabu.
It can be great.	Guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
It doesn’t have to have one room.	Kutaa tokko qabaachuu hin qabu.
I can't tell you anything else.	Waan biraa sitti himuu hin danda'u.
Rarely does anything look good.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti tokko gaarii fakkaata.
The problem is, no one really knows what they want.	Rakkoon jiru, dhuguma namni waan barbaadu beeku hin jiru.
It’s a bit like our situation.	Xiqqoo haala keenya fakkaata.
And I did it, too.	Anis nan godhe.
I will really go for it.	Dhuguma itti nan deema.
It just wasn’t anything.	Homaa hin turre qofa.
But that’s how it goes.	Garuu akkasitti deema.
Someone knew why, of course.	Namni tokko maaliif akka ta’e beeka ture, beekamaadha.
It was him.	Isa ture.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
It does us both good.	Lamaan keenyayyuu waan gaarii nuuf godha.
Just existing.	Jiraachuu qofa.
He keeps watching.	Inni ilaalaa jiraata.
And yet you are here now.	Ammas ta'ee amma as jirta.
I don’t want to stay here.	Ani as turuu hin barbaadu.
We need it a lot.	Baay'ee nu barbaachisa.
It wasn’t true.	Dhugaa hin turre.
I knew it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
It was just a matter of finding it.	Dhimma argachuu qofa ture.
I know you have it.	Akka qabdu nan beeka.
He certainly has to be.	Inni ta’uu akka qabu beekamaadha.
It can be dangerous.	Balaa qabaachuu danda'a.
You have to believe me.	Na amanuu qabda.
But if you don’t know if you’re doing it right.	Garuu yoo sirriitti hojjechaa akka jirtu hin beekne.
I think that was important.	Sun barbaachisaa ture jedheen yaada.
But he found he didn’t want to know.	Garuu beekuu akka hin barbaanne argate.
He has his hand in everything.	Waan hundumaa keessa harka isaa qaba.
A lot of it.	Baay'ee isaa.
To do real work.	Hojii dhugaa hojjechuuf.
From his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa irraa.
I didn’t want to live anymore.	Kana booda jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
They’re lucky you’re so good with kids.	Isaan carraa qaban akka ati ijoollee wajjin akkas gaarii taate.
Please find another way.	Mee karaa biraa barbaadaa.
I am clear.	Ani ifa dha.
I want to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuu nan barbaada.
That doesn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu.
I didn’t see him.	Isa hin argine.
Fortunately, this is not the case here.	Akka carraa ta'ee asitti kun hin ta'u.
Perhaps there is another reason.	Tarii sababni biraa jira.
There was no time to meet anyone else.	Yeroon nama biraa waliin wal arguu hin turre.
I don’t want this life anymore.	Kana booda jireenya kana hin barbaadu.
You may know this.	Kana beektu taʼa.
But it's such a human being.	Garuu akkas nama.
It may not be good for him.	Isaaf gaarii ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
They could get us some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko nuuf argachuu dandaʼu turan.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
We need to be aware of what is around us.	Waan naannoo keenya jiru beekuu qabna.
Overstatement, obviously.	Garmalee dubbachuu, ifaadha.
I hope you weren't right about that.	Waa'ee sanaa sirrii akka hin turre abdiin qaba.
He didn’t have any money.	Maallaqa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
That moment was mine.	Yeroon sun kan koo ture.
I'm not going to her.	Ani gara ishee hin deemu.
But that's not going to happen.	Garuu sun ta'uuf hin deemu.
I looked at them.	Anis isaan ilaale.
You can go then.	Yeroo sana deemuu dandeessa.
I didn’t know these things.	Wantoota kana hin beekne.
There were people in the house.	Mana keessa namoonni turan.
Like, she always was.	Akka, yeroo hundumaa turte.
It’s clear to go.	Deemuuf ifaadha.
I can really do it.	Dhuguma nan danda'a.
He loves me now.	Amma na jaalladha.
He shouldn’t have played like that.	Akkasitti taphachuu hin qabu ture.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
It’s more at work than you know.	Kan ati beektu caalaa hojii irra jira.
Why don't you do it.	Maaliif hin gootu.
So we’re the ones.	Kanaaf nuti.
I love everyone.	Nama hunda nan jaalladha.
But it never worked.	Garuu gonkumaa hin hojjenne.
We have no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabnu.
I don’t have a dog.	Saree hin qabu.
Just like you think.	Akkuma ati yaaddu.
This doesn't do anything.	Kun homaa hin godhu.
It was nothing new.	Waan haaraa hin turre.
Someone really has to do it.	Namni tokko dhuguma gochuu qaba.
I think she is so good at her job.	Hojii ishee irratti akka malee waan ga'umsa qabdu natti fakkaata.
I told him what I thought.	Anis yaada koo itti hime.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
I think a lot of people do that.	Namoonni baay'een waan akkasii hojjetu jedheen yaada.
He didn’t just walk in the door on his own.	Ofii isaatiin balbala keessa qofa hin deemne.
Which is the real thing.	Kan dhugaa ta'e.
he says.	jedha.
They know the work he did.	Hojii inni hojjete ni beeku.
You can do it alone.	Kophaa kee hojjechuu dandeessa.
I don’t want them.	Ani isaan hin barbaadu.
I had no idea before that.	Sana dura yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Look at his hands.	Harka isaa ilaalaa.
It wasn’t easy.	Salphaa hin turre.
We cannot ask you anything else.	Waan biraa isin gaafachuu hin dandeenyu.
I still don’t know why he asked.	Ammas maaliif akka gaafate hin beeku.
It must be a new one.	Kan haaraa ta'uu qaba.
It was happening again.	Ammas ta'aa ture.
This can’t be right.	Kun sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u.
He had none of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I know it has to be.	Akka ta'uu qabu nan beeka.
They were pretty good at that sort of thing.	Isaan waan akkasii irratti baayyee gaarii turan.
It was going to be very special.	Baayyee adda ta'uuf ture.
This time it’s my mother.	Yeroo kana haadha kooti.
I'm sure of that.	Sana mirkanaa'aa dha.
That’s a possibility.	Sun carraan jira.
She said it was easy.	Salphaa jette.
Like he got money.	Akka maallaqa argate.
It just wasn't happening.	Ta'aa hin turre qofa ture.
I can't talk for long.	Yeroo dheeraa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
He didn't think of anything.	Homaa hin yaadne.
Where she was.	Bakka isheen kan turte.
There is a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni jira.
He has a chance for him.	Carraa isaaf qaba.
He is just an idea now.	Inni amma yaada qofa.
He didn't do that.	Akkas hin goone.
But wait for us.	Garuu nu eegaa.
A bad month, that was.	Ji'a hamaa, sun ture.
We’re always working	Yeroo hunda hojjechaa jirra
I don’t understand why any of you did it.	Isin keessaa tokkollee maaliif akka godhe naaf hin galle.
It was on mine.	Kan koo irra ture.
Maybe it was neither.	Tarii lamaan isaaniiyyuu hin turre ta'a.
I want to leave it at that.	Akkasitti dhiisuu barbaada.
Can you help?.	Gargaaruu dandeessaa?.
He asked about you.	Waa'ee kee gaafate.
This would have been nice.	Silaa kun gaarii ture.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
I am not that girl.	Ani intala sana miti.
Without time, however, that means nothing.	Yeroo malee garuu sun homaa jechuu miti.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Halkan kana ishee waliin ta'uu barbaade.
So my man said.	Kanaaf namni koo jedhe.
Not two, not many.	Lamaan miti, hedduu miti.
Good luck out there.	Carraa gaarii achi keessaa.
But that was it .	Garuu sun ture .
I really don’t need this.	Dhuguma kana na hin barbaachisu.
I don't want to talk to you.	Sitti dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
I can't, I can't.	Hin danda'u hin danda'u.
She has my eyes.	Ija koo qabdi.
But now there was no time.	Amma garuu yeroon hin turre.
But only a little bit.	Garuu xiqqoo qofa.
It has two parts.	Kutaa lama qaba.
They are mine, not hers.	Isaan kan koo malee kan ishee miti.
So not yet.	Kanaaf ammallee miti.
It’s all still so fresh.	Hundi isaa ammallee akkas haaraa dha.
It certainly isn’t easy.	Salphaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But this is completely different.	Garuu kun guutummaatti adda.
That's how we have it.	Akkasitti qabna.
It’s so obvious.	Akkas ifaadha.
It just gets a little bit easier.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo salphaa ta'a qofa.
They just love themselves.	Of jaallatu qofa.
Not always.	Yeroo hunda miti.
Not just people like me.	Namoota akka koo qofa miti.
A great man.	Nama guddaa.
I think they were pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii turan jedheen yaada.
That’s what he told himself.	Akkas ofitti hime.
It should be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu qaba.
They are not like drinks.	Isaan akka dhugaatii miti.
This was the case.	Kun akkas ture.
Everything in his house is important.	Wanti mana isaa keessa jiru hundi barbaachisaa dha.
It’s a house.	Mana dha.
But nothing gave.	Garuu wanti kenne hin jiru.
They are on the road.	Karaa irra jiru.
Someone was watching.	Namni tokko ilaalaa ture.
I doubt something will come of it.	Wanti tokko akka irraa dhufu nan shakka.
You know you want one.	Tokko akka barbaaddu ni beekta.
He was in good humor.	Qoosaa gaarii keessa ture.
I can believe it.	Ani amanuu nan danda'a.
But what if it happens.	Garuu maal yoo ta'e.
I don't know of anyone else who can, but maybe they can.	Nama biraa kan danda'u hin beeku, tarii garuu ni danda'u ta'a.
He said where to go.	Bakka deemu jedhe.
I think it's different.	Adda natti fakkaata.
But it may be too late.	Garuu yeroon isaa darbe ta'uu danda'a.
So you have to believe me.	Kanaaf na amanuu qabda.
This couldn't happen.	Kun ta'uu hin dandeenye.
He never does.	Inni gonkumaa hin godhu.
As it was I didn't really know if there was really anything going on.	Akkuma ture dhuguma wanti ta'aa jiru jiraachuu isaa dhuguma hin beeku ture.
I know you are doing your best.	Waan dandeessu hunda gochaa akka jirtu nan beeka.
Things like .	Wantoota akka .
You can do it so far.	Hanga ammaatti ni dandeessa.
If you do, this is for you.	Yoo akkas goote kun siif ta'a.
I think you are right on that.	Sana irratti sirrii dha jedheen yaada.
Which is not what is happening.	Kan waan ta'aa jiru miti.
He saw two people in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa namoota lama arge.
It's pretty obvious that things have to happen.	Wanti ta'uu akka qabu baay'ee ifaadha.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Asitti homaa hin turre, homaa hin turre.
But wait there is more.	Garuu eegaa kana caalaa jira.
It almost seems non-existent.	Waan hin jirre fakkaata jechuun ni danda'ama.
If not this hour.	Yoo sa'aatii kana hin taane.
I never knew what to say.	Waan jedhu gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
School nights.	Halkan mana barumsaa.
I know what to do.	Waan godhu nan beeka.
It doesn’t work if we’re with just one girl.	Intala tokko qofa waliin yoo taane hin hojjetu.
If it all happens.	Hundi yoo ta'e.
I don't need it.	Na hin barbaachisu.
He saw the truth about himself.	Dhugaa waa'ee ofii isaa arge.
Now is the time to say it.	Amma yeroon jedhu amma.
You don’t have to do something.	Waan tokko gochuun dirqama miti.
That seems to work well.	Sun waan gaarii hojjetu fakkaata.
He was trying, but he had been here before.	Inni yaalaa ture, garuu kanaan dura as ture.
I'm not so sure.	Ani akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
In the car.	Konkolaataa keessa.
You like your work.	Hojii kee sitti tola.
I know my room.	Kutaa koo nan beeka.
It was still good.	Ammas gaarii ture.
They love me there.	Isaan achitti na jaallatu.
What we knew to be true was not true.	Wanti nuti dhugaa ta'uu beekne dhugaa hin turre.
That’s probably not the case here.	Asitti sun ta’uu hin oolu.
In my case, the two are different.	Dhimma koo keessatti lamaan isaanii adda adda.
You can get this again.	Ammas kana argachuu dandeessu.
Even talking backwards.	Duubatti dubbachuu illee.
Today, however, it had happened on their watch.	Har'a garuu sa'aatii isaanii irratti ta'ee ture.
I can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin danda'u.
This is a possibility.	Kun ta'uu danda'a.
You have too much of your mother in you.	Haadha kee garmalee si keessa qabda.
This doesn’t have to be the case.	Kun dirqama akkas ta’uu hin qabu.
I didn’t do it at all.	Ani tasumaa hin hojjenne.
They are usually not good people.	Yeroo baayyee namoota gaarii miti.
People you barely know.	Namoota ati baay'ee hin beekne.
He is in her.	Inni ishee keessa jira.
I don't understand anything that happened tonight.	Waan halkan kana ta'e tokkollee naaf hin galle.
It was very likely.	Baayyee hin oolu ture.
Like many others before me.	Akkuma namoota baay'ee na dura turan.
Available.	Jira.
But he always knew he couldn’t stay.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa turuu akka hin dandeenye beeka ture.
It must be the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'uu qaba.
Please go somewhere else.	Mee bakka biraa deemaa.
They know this.	Kana ni beeku.
What exists, exists.	Wanti jiru, jira.
She didn't know.	Isheen hin beekne turte.
That they never care.	Akka isaan gonkumaa dhimma hin qabne.
I could be wrong though.	Ani garuu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
But there was nothing she could do.	Garuu wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
He could have had another one.	Kan biraa qabaachuu danda'a ture.
You don’t understand any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee siif hin galle.
For a moment he thought everything would go away.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti hundi ni deema jedhee yaade.
They are inside me.	Isaan keessa koo jiru.
He didn’t have the answer yet.	Deebii isaa hanga ammaatti hin qabu ture.
I didn't understand this either.	Anis kana hin hubanne.
They didn’t want me around.	Isaan naannoo kootti na hin barbaanne.
But no one wanted to.	Garuu namni barbaade hin jiru.
I was right there.	Ani sirriitti achi ture.
One never knows .	Namni gonkumaa hin beeku .
They know where we would have to go.	Silaa eessa deemuu akka qabnu ni beeku.
We were always different.	Yeroo hundumaa adda turre.
He was just a guy.	Inni gurbaa qofa ture.
Not sure if that's good or bad.	Sun gaarii fi hamaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
Look at what he says.	Waan inni jedhu ilaalaa.
I only need one though.	Tokko qofa na barbaachisa garuu.
But it was her.	Garuu ishee ture.
He knows he does that, a lot of things.	Akkas akka godhu beeka, waan baay'ee.
Mood.	Haala.
What if it 's	Maal yoo ta'e .
You don’t have to go alone.	Kophaa kee deemuu hin qabdu.
That may not be the case.	Sun ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
Like, everyone knows that.	Akka, namni hundi sana ni beeka.
Which should be enough.	Kan gahaa ta'uu qabu.
And yet it is never perfect.	Ammas gonkumaa guutuu miti.
It’s all perfectly simple and clear.	Hundi isaa guutummaatti salphaa fi ifaadha.
That's what should have happened.	Silaa waan ta'uu qabu kanuma ture.
I couldn't believe what just happened.	Waan amma ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye.
This looks good again.	Kun ammas gaarii fakkaata.
That’s what we wanted to do.	Kana gochuu barbaanne turre.
I knew that feeling.	Miira sana nan beeka ture.
That was me at my worst.	Sun ani yeroo hamaa kootti ture.
I would have had to go.	Silaa deemuun dirqama ture.
Still one of 'us'.	Ammallee 'nu' keessaa tokko.
That’s a possibility.	Sun ta’uu danda’a.
That shouldn’t exist.	Sun jiraachuu hin qabu.
Like maybe this time he's gone.	Akka tarii yeroo kana inni hin jirre ta'a.
I am with my mother most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee haadha koo waliin jira.
Let me clarify something.	Mee waan tokko ifa godha.
I had no questions, I didn’t want answers.	Gaaffii tokkollee hin qabu ture, deebii hin barbaadu ture.
He wanted to go with her.	Ishee waliin deemuu barbaade.
I already have money.	Ani duruu maallaqa qaba.
You need it right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana si barbaachisa.
We have nothing to deal with.	Waan itti wal qabnu hin qabnu.
Which is definitely not true.	Kan dhugaa hin taane beekamaadha.
It'll be good.	Gaarii ta'a.
People need to know what happened.	Namoonni waan ta’e beekuu qabu.
I didn't want to talk too much.	Baay'ee dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
It couldn’t be true.	Dhugaa ta’uu hin danda’u ture.
It didn’t last long really.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre dhuguma.
This had not happened here for a long time.	Kun yeroo dheeraaf asitti hin taane ture.
He didn't want to answer.	Deebii kennuu hin barbaanne.
But today, they do.	Har'a garuu, ni ta'u.
Her thoughts about her father.	Yaada isheen waa'ee abbaa ishee.
It's a very nice book.	Kitaaba baayyee namatti tola.
There is nothing else.	Wanti biraa hin jiru.
She said that.	Akkas jette.
I'm here to help.	Gargaaruuf as jira.
He wanted you.	Inni si barbaade.
Not that he didn't know that, but he had her with him.	Kana hin beekne jechuu miti, garuu ishee isa bira qaba ture.
We were in school together.	Mana barumsaa waliin turre.
Something is very wrong.	Waan tokko baay'ee dogoggora.
She was very young when I had her.	Yeroon ishee qabu baayyee xiqqoo turte.
He looked at everything he had done.	Waan hojjete hunda ilaale.
Certainly not with me.	Ana waliin akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That's how it's been.	Akkas ta'ee jira.
We are in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirra.
Man knows nothing.	Namni homaa hin beeku.
That's just how it happens.	Akkasitti qofa ta'a.
She wasn't there, of course.	Isheen achi hin turre beekamaadha.
That is what he did.	Kan godhe kanuma ture.
This was terrible.	Kun hamaa ture.
It takes money.	Maallaqa barbaada.
It was really happening.	Dhuguma ta'aa ture.
Completely issued.	Guutummaatti kan ba'e.
It demanded a moment of my time.	Yeroo koo keessaa yeroo muraasaaf naaf gaafate.
I don’t think anyone does.	Namni waan godhu natti hin fakkaatu.
It wouldn't have worked.	Silaa hin hojjetu ture.
He might have a daughter.	Intala qabaachuu danda'a.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I'm going upstairs.	Ani ol deemaa jira.
Not that it matters what you look like.	Maal akka fakkaattu dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
I can't do this alone.	Kana kophaa koo gochuu hin danda'u.
No one can know.	Namni beekuu hin danda'u.
Now you just wait.	Amma ati eegaa qofa.
But I do know one thing.	Ani garuu waan tokko nan beeka.
I can find no such help in it.	Gargaarsa akkasii keessaa argachuu hin danda'u.
We both wanted to go.	Lamaan keenyayyuu deemuu barbaanne.
She wouldn’t have known then.	Silaa yeroo sana hin beektu turte.
That's what's happening here.	Kan asitti ta'aa jiru kana.
That’s just how we did it.	Akkasitti hojjenne qofa.
She probably won't.	Isheen hin gootu ta'a.
It’s all over the house.	Mana hunda irra jira.
He is still here.	Ammallee as jira.
You know, it’s not a bad idea.	Beektaa yaada hamaa miti.
He probably has almost none.	Inni tarii tokkollee hin qabu jechuun ni danda’ama.
We don't do anything.	Homaa hin goonu.
It's going to be funny.	Qoosaa ta'a.
Someone was home.	Namni tokko mana ture.
It's probably going to be good.	Gaarii ta'uu hin oolu.
We need to see my father.	Abbaa koo arguu qabna.
A week, maybe.	Torban tokko, tarii.
You need time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu si barbaachisa.
Sometimes I do that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas nan godha.
But maybe it won't.	Tarii garuu hin ta'u.
We can do nothing more to help.	Kana caalaa gargaaruuf homaa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
But he certainly didn’t.	Garuu akkas akka hin goone beekamaadha.
This feeling of.	Miira kana kan.
20 months ago.	Ji'a 20 dura.
It was very large.	Baayyee guddaa ture.
Such a person.	Nama akkasii.
You don’t have any more.	Kana caalaa hin qabdu.
She hadn’t done anything wrong.	Hamaa hin hojjenne turte.
And I just did it.	Anis qofa godhe.
It didn’t last long though.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre garuu.
Not sure much else.	Waan biraa baay'ee ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
She couldn't just let that happen.	Kana qofa akka ta'u gochuu hin dandeessu turte.
That seems to be what everyone is interested in.	Kan namni hundi fedhii qabu kanuma fakkaata.
He just said it.	Jedhe qofa.
I was.	Ani ture.
I knew everything.	Waan hundumaa nan beeka ture.
It can often be wrong.	Yeroo baay’ee dogoggora ta’uu danda’a.
Everything in its place.	Waan hunda bakka isaatti.
Now they do everything together.	Amma waan hunda waliin hojjetu.
Not like we did.	Akka nuti goone miti.
Doing two jobs.	Hojii lama hojjechuu.
I was the one who timed it right.	Yeroo sirriitti kan itti kenne ana ture.
There was nothing else he could do.	Wanti biraa inni gochuu danda'u hin turre.
She was in good hands.	Harka gaarii keessa turte.
People have been very interested in this area for a long time.	Namoonni naannoo kanaaf fedhii guddaa qaban yeroo dheeraaf.
I have no idea she does.	Isheen akka gootu yaada hin qabu.
It will never happen.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
He was in a good mood.	Miira gaarii keessa ture.
We have everything we need here.	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda asitti qabna.
It looks pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
If he did, he would be working.	Osoo akkas godhe silaa hojjechaa jira.
She said it was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture jette.
It was a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Your doing this.	Kana gochuu keessan.
He tried again.	Ammas yaale.
This could not be true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
This is my opportunity.	Kun carraa kooti.
I think it was just me.	Ana qofa ture jedheen yaada.
I love that idea.	Yaada sana baay'een jaalladha.
He couldn’t say why he thought that.	Maaliif akkas yaade jechuu hin dandeenye.
You just need a good teacher.	Barsiisaa gaarii qofa si barbaachisa.
That's why he said it.	Kanaaf jedhe.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
Maybe it was him.	Tarii inni ture.
I think he meant it didn’t.	Akkas hin taane jechuu isaa natti fakkaata.
His was a bad life.	Kan isaa jireenya hamaa ture.
It doesn’t always work.	Yeroo hunda hin hojjetu.
But, then .	Garuu, sana booda .
They will be the only ones.	Isaan qofa ta'u.
I love this book so much.	Kitaaba kana baay'een jaalladha.
Not often but sometimes.	Yeroo baayyee osoo hin taane yeroo tokko tokko.
This is not an easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa miti.
Now with the car.	Amma konkolaataa waliin.
She has many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qabdi.
You must come.	Isin dhufuu qabdu.
That was it.	Kana ture.
No comment section.	Kutaa yaada hin qabu.
I am nothing anymore.	Kana booda ani homaa miti.
I'm right there.	Ani sirriitti achi jira.
She is never wrong.	Isheen gonkumaa dogoggora hin qabdu.
Of course, that was not the case.	Akkas akka hin turre beekamaadha.
Both of us.	Lamaan keenya.
I wouldn't have known.	Silaa hin beeku ture.
Maybe there is nothing here.	Tarii wanti as jiru hin jiru ta'a.
I think for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf jedheen yaada.
In that case it would be none of his business.	Haala sana keessatti dhimma isaa tokkollee hin ta'u ture.
In the present moment.	Yeroo ammaa kana keessatti.
He had a wife.	Haadha manaa qaba ture.
It was no different now.	Amma adda hin turre.
As well as not seeing her.	Akkuma ishee hin argine gaarii ta'a.
I knew what she would do.	Maal akka gootu nan beeka ture.
I passed him by.	Anis isa bira darbe.
We are indeed.	Dhuguma jirra.
No one has spoken.	Namni dubbate hin jiru.
Except for me.	Ana malee.
He could have been here.	Silaa as jiraachuu danda'a ture.
That would be really bad.	Sun dhuguma hamaa ta'a.
Something has to give, quickly.	Waan tokko kennuu qaba, dafee kennuu qaba.
This is not my dress.	Kun uffata koo miti.
But it was, it had to be.	Garuu ture, ta'uu qaba ture.
She was so different from everyone else.	Isheen nama hundumaa irraa baayʼee adda turte.
If it were really easy, everyone would be doing it.	Osoo dhuguma salphaa ta'ee namni hundi hojjechaa ture.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
He wanted what he wanted.	Waan barbaadu barbaade.
None of this is correct.	Kana keessaa tokkollee sirrii miti.
But that needs to happen soon.	Garuu sun dafee ta'uu qaba.
It works well.	Gaarii hojjeta.
It almost sounds like her.	Sagalee ishee fakkaata jechuun ni danda'ama.
Lots of emotions.	Miira baay'ee.
I know about your parents.	Waa'ee warra kee nan beeka.
Sound about right?.	Sagalee waa'ee sirrii?.
This seems to help a bit.	Kun xiqqoo waan gargaaru fakkaata.
That is not true.	Sun dhugaa miti.
It was a little while ago.	Yeroo xiqqoo dura ture.
She has eyes for that sort of thing.	Waan akkasii ija qabdi.
No one else will come to your aid.	Namni biraa isin gargaaru hin dhufu.
But no one in our class knew much about it.	Garuu kutaa keenya keessatti namni waa'ee isaa baay'ee beeku hin turre.
But the reason for this is obvious.	Garuu sababni kanaa ifaadha.
You’re not me.	Ati ana miti.
You know my wife.	Haadha manaa koo ni beekta.
This morning, however, is a completely different matter.	Ganama kana garuu dhimma guutummaatti adda.
Right through his hands.	Sirriitti karaa harka isaatiin.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
It's going to be good.	Gaarii ta'uuf deema.
You did well.	Gaarii goote ati.
But this is happening.	Garuu kun ta'aa jira.
He loves me so much.	Baay'ee na jaalladha.
I didn’t know where to go now.	Amma eessa akkan deemu hin beeku ture.
Another thing	Wanti biraa .
He said something very important.	Waan baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e tokko dubbate.
You know it's time for a new person.	Yeroon nama haaraa akka ta'e beekta.
But, you know, that’s okay.	Garuu, beekta, sun homaa miti.
But not everything worked.	Wanti hundi garuu hin hojjenne.
Things were not what they seemed.	Wanti akka fakkaatu hin turre.
They still had a long way to go before them.	Ammallee karaa dheeraa isaan dura deemuu qabu turan.
But luck was with him.	Carraan garuu isa waliin ture.
But he didn't do anything like that.	Garuu waan akkasii hin hojjenne.
He will always be with us.	Yeroo hundumaa nu waliin ta'a.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
He was our father.	Abbaa keenya ture.
He did not say when.	Yoom akka ta'e garuu hin dubbanne.
It’s just nice for tonight.	Halkan kanaaf qofa namatti tola.
Only in one case.	Haala tokko qofa keessatti.
What were we doing?	Maal hojjechaa turre?
It was obvious that something was wrong.	Waan tokko akka dogoggora ta’e ifa ture.
This is my own.	Kun kan kooti.
But it's good.	Garuu gaarii dha.
It doesn’t mean you can’t speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeessu jechuu miti.
He was there once.	Yeroo tokko achi ture.
The timing was right.	Yeroon sun sirrii ture.
It’s working well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
He didn’t make much of it.	Inni waan guddaa irraa hin hojjenne.
It seemed out of place.	Bakka waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
We did a good pair, we did.	Lamaan gaarii hojjenne, hojjenne.
Mine doesn’t look like that.	Kan koo akkas hin fakkaatu.
Lots of new people.	Namoota haaraa baay'ee.
I can't see her right now.	Yeroo ammaa ishee arguu hin danda'u.
The real one.	Kan dhugaa.
You know this is wrong.	Kun dogoggora akka ta'e ni beekta.
I want to be needed.	Ani akkan barbaachisu barbaada.
We don't need it now.	Amma nu hin barbaachisu.
No one had it.	Namni tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I’m not looking at her.	Ani ishee ilaalaa hin jiru.
it shouldn’t be said.	jechuu hin qabu.
They want me now.	Amma na barbaadu.
That wasn’t the case before.	Sun kanaan dura hin turre.
I need a little hand.	Harka xiqqoo na barbaachisa.
You can stay with us tonight.	Halkan kana nu bira turuu dandeessu.
It was true, though.	Dhugaa ture garuu.
The worst one.	Kan hamaa ta'e.
You never want to shop there again.	Kana booda achitti bitachuu gonkumaa hin barbaaddu.
He should have done a lot more.	Silaa waan baay'ee hojjechuu qaba ture.
I like it.	Natti tola.
I could buy this.	Kana bitachuu nan danda'a ture.
Not me, of course.	Ana miti, beekamaadha.
Maybe even your life.	Tarii jireenya kee illee ta'a.
His whole life.	Jireenya isaa guutuu.
He never told.	Inni gonkumaa hin himne.
We have to live without that.	Sana malee jiraachuu qabna.
They were one.	Isaan tokko turan.
I want to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu barbaada.
This was all a terrible mistake.	Kun hundi dogoggora hamaa ture.
She had no time for it.	Yeroo itti hin qabdu turte.
What if it just happens.	Maal ta'a yoo qofa ta'e.
Maybe it's that simple.	Tarii akkas salphaa ta'uu danda'a.
It’s not our business.	Dhimma keenya miti.
But there is no chance of that happening to me.	Garuu carraan sun naaf ta'uu hin jiru.
It always has.	Yeroo hundumaa qaba.
I want more than that.	Kana caalaa barbaada.
He knew them well enough.	Inni akka gaariitti isaan beeka ture.
I can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
He knows what he is doing.	Waan hojjechaa jiru ni beeka.
We have a place waiting for you.	Bakka isin eegaa jiru qabna.
I wasn’t waiting anymore.	Kana booda eegaa hin turre.
She saw no one in her house.	Mana ishee keessaa nama hin argine.
I know that, you know that.	Ani kana beeka, ati kana beekta.
He!' 	Isa!'
said.	jedhe.
I just like three days, not two.	Guyyaa lama osoo hin taane sadii qofa natti tola.
This one does the job.	Inni kun hojii hojjeta.
So we agreed to do three of us.	Kanaaf sadii keenya akka goonu walii galle.
It was too big and spacious.	Garmalee guddaa fi bal'aa ture.
A new person.	Nama haaraa.
I’m not a bad guy.	Ani gurbaa hamaa miti.
It's just right.	Sirrii qofa.
I think you can help me and even find him.	Na gargaaruu dandeessa, isa argachuu illee dandeessa jedheen yaada.
Mostly at night.	Irra caalaa halkan ta'a.
But that’s not how it works.	Garuu akkasitti hin hojjetu.
I am totally over it.	Ani guutummaatti irra jira.
But that was not his way.	Sun garuu karaa isaa hin turre.
That says about all.	Sun waa'ee hunda jedha.
Then they can get lucky.	Sana booda carraa argachuu danda'u.
You just need a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa si barbaachisa.
It was in front of my eyes.	Ija koo dura ture.
I know where he went.	Eessa akka deeme nan beeka.
People loved her very much.	Namoonni baayʼee ishee jaallatu turan.
Everything is fine at work.	Hojii irratti wanti hundi gaarii dha.
So I just have to make it work.	Kanaaf akka hojjetu gochuu qofa qaba.
This should not have worked.	Kun silaa hojjechuu hin qabu ture.
I know that is true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka.
Look for Him.	Isa barbaadaa.
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
No one wanted to talk to me anymore.	Kana booda namni natti dubbachuu barbaadu hin turre.
He had a wife and children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee qaba ture.
He knew he could do it alone.	Kophaa isaa akka danda'u beeka ture.
They didn’t go.	Isaan hin deemne.
That may not be the case.	Sun akkas taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
But he doesn't have a dog.	Garuu saree hin qabu.
It was their duty.	Dirqama isaanii ture.
He will live.	Inni ni jiraata.
It’s almost identical to the real thing.	Waan dhugaa wajjin wal fakkaata jechuun ni danda’ama.
It’s not complete.	Guutuu miti.
No one told me how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu namni natti hime hin jiru.
He knew where he was.	Bakka jiru ni beeka ture.
He had two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama qaba ture.
He did well.	Inni gaarii hojjete.
We hoped he was right.	Sirrii akka ta'e abdii qabna turre.
That's just one idea of ​​how it could happen.	Sun akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u yaada tokko qofa.
That should be right.	Sun sirrii ta'uu qaba.
They must be separate.	Adda ta’uu qabu.
I couldn’t do anything to help her at that point.	Yeroo sanatti ishee gargaaruuf homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
Other times he can when you don't think he can.	Yeroo biraa yeroo ati danda'a jettee hin yaadne ni danda'a.
Something else.	Waan biraa.
He's looking for me.	Na barbaadaa jira.
It is usually very nice.	Yeroo baayyee baayyee namatti tola.
It's just us.	Nu qofa.
I like how it turned out.	Akkamitti akka ta'e natti tola.
I wasn’t necessarily.	Ani dirqama hin turre.
I'm not feeling good about this area.	Ani waa'ee naannoo kanaa miira gaarii hin qabu.
Two out of three.	Sadii keessaa lama.
Clearly, it may matter today.	Har’a dhimma qabaachuu akka danda’u ifaadha.
Not here, obviously.	Asitti miti, ifaadha.
Everyone has a bad time.	Namni hundi yeroo hamaa qaba.
I really like this one.	Isa kana baay'een jaalladha.
I just don’t know what to do.	Waan godhu qofa hin beeku.
You are doing this.	Kana gochaa jirta.
You can’t do it at home.	Mana keessatti hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
Everyone there knows me.	Achitti namni hundi na beeka.
He got what he wanted.	Waan barbaade argate.
He needed a job.	Hojii isa barbaachisa ture.
There is indeed.	Dhuguma ni jira.
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
He didn’t do anything else.	Waan biraa hin hojjenne.
I couldn’t be more wrong.	Kana caalaa dogoggora qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
Three o'clock in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii sadii.
It was very much what happened to me.	Baay'ee waan natti ta'e ture.
They are very, very dangerous.	Baayyee baayyee balaa qabu.
But none of them were human.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee nama hin turre.
But that seems to be .	Garuu sun fakkaata .
He wasn't sure what he wanted to do.	Maal gochuu akka barbaade mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
We don’t have that many people there.	Namoota hamma kanaa achi hin qabnu.
You can ask him about it.	Waa'ee kanaa isa gaafachuu dandeessu.
Maybe it will happen.	Tarii ni ta'a.
I haven’t had one yet.	Hanga ammaatti tokkollee hin qabu.
But it’s not a name.	Garuu maqaa miti.
Very similar.	Baayyee wal fakkaata.
Tom is the tallest guy in his class.	Toom kutaa isaa keessatti gurbaa dheeraa dha.
It’s not the right time.	Yeroo sirrii miti.
Except for this one.	Isa kana malee.
You know you have a day.	Guyyaa akka qabdu ni beekta.
You just have to ask.	Gaafachuu qofa qabda.
Those are the things you have to do all the time.	Wantoota yeroo hundumaa gochuu qabdu sun.
It wasn’t a good feeling.	Miira gaarii hin turre.
That never happened.	Sun ta'ee hin beeku.
She certainly knew.	Isheen akka beektu beekamaadha.
I said that, of course.	Ani akkas jedheen ture, beekamaadha.
That’s absolutely right.	Sun guutummaatti sirrii dha.
You have to go back.	Deebi'uu qabda.
Look at the guys over there.	Mee gurbaa achi jiru ilaalaa.
You know better than I do.	Ana caalaa ni beekta.
You know a great deal.	Waan guddaa beekta.
I told myself it didn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu jedheen ofitti hime.
That was a different matter entirely.	Sun guutummaatti dhimma adda ture.
Can anyone help me with this?.	Kana irratti namni na gargaaru jiraa?.
I have to go now.	Amma deemuun dirqama.
But it obviously is.	Garuu akka ta'e ifaadha.
This is a good one.	Kun gaarii dha.
You don’t have to go alone.	Kophaa kee deemuu hin qabdu.
But he wants more.	Garuu kana caalaa barbaada.
Your work there was excellent.	Hojiin ati achitti hojjechaa turte baayʼee gaarii ture.
He loves his ideas.	Yaada isaa ni jaallata.
She still had no job and they still had no money.	Ammallee hojii hin qabdu turte ammas maallaqa hin qaban turan.
It wasn't where you wanted to be.	Bakka ati ta'uu barbaaddu hin turre.
He’s not right here.	Inni sirriitti as hin jiru.
What were they doing?	Maal hojjechaa turan?
His little daughter.	Intala isaa xiqqoo.
Not against them, but against himself.	Isaan irratti miti, ofii isaa irratti.
She was what she seemed to be.	Isheen waan isheen fakkaattu turte.
And now you know there’s another problem.	Ammas rakkoon biraa akka jiru beekta.
I can't have that.	Sana qabaachuu hin danda'u.
It was great.	Guddaa ture.
That’s not enough.	Sana gahaa miti.
Maybe things are better now.	Tarii amma wanti jiru gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
He was not as right as his mother.	Inni akka haadha isaa sirrii hin turre.
They were all waiting.	Hundi isaanii eegaa turan.
Not that you would know that.	Silaa sana beekta jechuu miti.
I was just trying to help.	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa ture.
He wondered what he was going to do now.	Amma maal gochuuf deema jedhee yaade.
I couldn’t even see it.	Arguu illee hin dandeenye.
It is no longer clear.	Kana booda ifa miti.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
He hadn’t told anyone anything.	Inni homaa namatti hin himne ture.
That's pretty obvious.	Sun baayyee ifaadha.
You are my father.	Ati abbaa kooti.
No other language is needed.	Afaan biraa hin barbaachisu.
I don't really know why though.	Maaliif akka ta'e garuu dhuguma hin beeku.
There was no one else.	Namni bira hin turre.
I didn’t mean me.	Ana jechuu koo hin turre.
He had my mother.	Haadha koo qaba ture.
She has no idea why she is here.	Maaliif akka as jirtu homaa hin beektu.
Now everything seemed to be in place.	Amma wanti hundi bakka isaa waan jiru fakkaata ture.
How does that work?	Sun akkamitti hojjeta?
If that's what you want.	Yoo akkas barbaaddu ta'e.
I like a lot of them.	Baay'een isaanii natti tola.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
I wonder how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e nan yaada.
She had to be perfect.	Guutuu ta'uu qabdi turte.
Something happened, something new.	Waan ta'e, waan haaraa.
It was just a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee qofa ture.
He never needed another name.	Maqaa biraa gonkumaa isa hin barbaachifne.
Someone was at the door.	Namni tokko balbala dura ture.
He had no interest in it.	Fedhii tokkollee isaaf hin qabu ture.
My interview went very well.	Gaaffii fi deebii koo baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme.
It's just a joke.	Qoosaa qofa.
With my friends.	Hiriyyoota koo waliin.
She was the one in the wrong.	Isheen ishee dogoggora keessa turte.
One of many.	Hedduu keessaa tokko.
There is nothing out here.	As ala wanti jiru hin jiru.
A little thing, nothing more.	Waan xiqqoo, kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
This is not a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii miti.
We just did it.	Nuti qofa hojjenne.
It’s not even a feeling.	Miira illee miti.
It is in a good location.	Bakka gaarii irra jira.
Things don’t seem that way to us.	Wanti akkasitti nuuf hin fakkaatu.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
I hope this helps someone.	Kun nama tokko akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
We didn’t have a home.	Mana hin qabnu turre.
But even this is very clear.	Garuu kun illee baay’ee ifaadha.
No one goes that far.	Namni hangas deemu hin jiru.
I still don't know much about her.	Ammallee waa'ee ishee waan baay'ee hin beeku.
Not many people could keep up with him.	Namoonni baay'een isa waliin deemuu hin dandeenye.
I just can't have this.	Ani kana qabaachuu qofa hin danda'u.
Really, really good stuff.	Dhuguma, dhuguma waan gaarii.
I can't say when.	Yoom jechuu hin danda'u.
They want me.	Isaan na barbaadu.
Three weeks without them had been wonderful.	Torban sadii isaan malee baay'ee namatti tola ture.
But I have no forgiveness.	Garuu dhiifama hin qabu.
It took you last month.	Ji'a darbe siif fudhate.
They were all like that.	Hundi isaanii akkas turan.
One of them was my husband.	Isaan keessaa tokko abbaa manaa koo ture.
No one has gone your way.	Namni karaa kee irra deeme hin jiru.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
That can’t be true.	Sun dhugaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
He was really lucky.	Dhuguma carraa qaba ture.
I just haven’t seen them yet.	Hanga ammaatti isaan hin argine qofa.
The timing had to be right.	Yeroon sun sirrii taʼuu qaba ture.
No one else could ask this question, only him.	Gaaffii kana namni biraa gaafachuu hin dandeenye, isa qofa.
Most likely they will be.	Baay’ee kan hin oolle ni ta’u.
Something wasn’t right.	Wanti tokko sirrii hin turre.
I go by a lot of names.	Maqaa baay'een deema.
It looks new.	Haaraa fakkaata.
This is not a big deal.	Kun dhimma guddaa miti.
He wasn’t around the room that much.	Hamma sana naannoo kutaa sanaa hin turre.
We don’t need money anymore.	Kana booda qarshii nu hin barbaachisu.
I'm still not sure that's the case.	Ammallee akkas ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
She was good to me.	Isheen naaf gaarii turte.
It was very bad.	Baayyee hamaa ture.
He's very nice to me.	Inni baay'ee naaf tola.
I don't want to be one of those people.	Namoota sana keessaa tokko ta'uu hin barbaadu.
We only have a few cars up here.	As ol konkolaataa muraasa qofa qabna.
They think they have their man.	Nama isaanii waan qaban itti fakkaata.
He said nothing of what he saw.	Waan arge homaa hin dubbanne.
Repeat that you are never going to be one.	Gonkumaa tokko ta'uuf akka hin deemne irra deebi'i.
But they were really very interested.	Garuu dhuguma baay’ee fedhii qaban turan.
I didn’t want him there.	Achitti isa hin barbaanne.
There is no chance.	Carraan hin jiru.
It’s not a car.	Konkolaataa miti.
when.	yoom.
You could say that’s not great.	Sun guddaa miti jechuu dandeessa.
She was alone.	Isheen kophaa ishee turte.
There is hope.	Abdiin jira.
There are no environmental problems.	Rakkoon naannoo hin jiru.
Just like you.	Akkuma kee.
It can’t be like that.	Akkas ta’uu hin danda’u.
I can't say when.	Yoom jechuu hin danda'u.
He was her only hope.	Inni abdii ishee qofa ture.
That came that night.	Sun halkan sana dhufe.
I'm looking for it during the week.	Torban keessa barbaadaa jira.
They love you.	Isaan si jaallatu.
I want to live with you.	Si waliin jiraachuu barbaada.
Everything is fine so far.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi gaarii dha.
That was just two days ago.	Sun guyyaa lama dura qofa ture.
It is still in operation.	Ammas hojii irra jira.
That’s how he found me.	Akkasitti na argate.
He became someone who was not me.	Nama ana hin taane ta'e.
He would have always loved you.	Silaa yoomiyyuu si jaallatu ture.
Can you believe it?	Amanuu dandeessaa?
That was me three months ago.	Sun ji'a sadii dura ana ture.
I'm not sure it will.	Akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
Perhaps that is the case.	Tarii akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
But that’s exactly it.	Garuu sirriitti kanuma.
I know there’s a chance of that.	Carraan sanaa akka jiru nan beeka.
He is doing a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjechaa jira.
You can't see it.	Arguu hin dandeessu.
Where were we?	Eessa turre?
They tell you how to make your.	Akkamitti akka kee gootu sitti himu.
It's been happening.	Ta'ee jira.
I was in the light.	Ani ifa keessa ture.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
We just have it.	Nu qofa qabna.
I think you should come with me.	Na waliin dhufuu qabda jedheen yaada.
Good question!	Gaaffii gaarii!
I'm glad that's the case.	Akkas ta'uu isaatti gammadeera.
I can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
I don't think anyone can!.	Namni waan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu!.
It was exactly what happened.	Sirriitti waan ta'e ture.
He looks good.	Inni gaarii fakkaata.
But things were not so good at home.	Garuu mana keessatti wanti akkas gaarii hin turre.
He doesn’t do anything.	Inni homaa hin hojjetu.
I don’t have it.	Hin qabu.
It has everything you need.	Waan isin barbaachisu hunda of keessaa qaba.
People say it will be obvious.	Namoonni ifa ta'a jedhu.
He just can't help her.	Inni qofa ishee gargaaruu hin danda'u.
You were one of my people.	Ati namoota koo keessaa tokko turte.
I never wanted this to happen.	Kun akka ta'u gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
But there’s nothing she can do about it.	Garuu wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
Except he has it.	Inni qabu malee.
It may be so and so.	Akkas ta’ee akkas ta’uu danda’a.
A week passed.	Torban tokko darbe.
There's not much to say.	Waan baay'ee jedhu hin jiru.
It’s doing really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jira.
I’m just trying to help.	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa jira.
So much can go wrong.	Kanaaf waan baay'een dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
So obviously something was wrong.	Kanaaf wanti tokko dogoggora akka ture ifaadha.
One cannot just buy a job.	Namni tokko hojii qofa bitachuu hin danda'u.
Not that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura miti.
The longer one.	Kan dheeraa.
Tell me your problem.	Rakkoo kee natti himi.
I couldn’t quite do that.	Ani guutummaatti sana gochuu hin dandeenye.
If only she wasn't already.	Osoo isheen duraan hin turre ta'ee.
It started out well.	Akka gaariitti jalqabe.
It looked like him but it wasn’t.	Akka isaa fakkaata ture garuu hin turre.
The job isn't too bad.	Hojiin sun baayyee hamaa miti.
There is one possibility.	Carraan tokko jira.
He was walking with someone else at the time.	Yeroo sanatti nama biraa waliin deemaa ture.
She wants nothing more to do with him.	Kana caalaa waan isa waliin qabdu hin barbaaddu.
It's been a lot.	Baay'ee ta'ee jira.
I just thought you meant someone else.	Nama biraa jechuu kee qofa natti fakkaate.
He had two situations.	Haala lama qaba ture.
It should help a lot.	Baayyee gargaaruu qaba.
There is no one there.	Namni achi hin jiru.
We are waiting and watching.	Eegaa jirra, ilaalaa jirra.
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
You just can’t see them.	Isaan arguu qofa hin dandeessu.
Need to have a car.	Konkolaataa qabaachuu barbaachisa.
I couldn’t believe my own eyes.	Ija ofii amanuu hin dandeenye.
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
They loved their daughter very much.	Intala isaanii baayyee jaallatu turan.
I have a slightly brighter idea.	Yaada xiqqoo ifa ta'e qaba.
I didn’t know anyone there.	Achitti nama hin beeku ture.
But he has the same desire.	Inni garuu fedhii wal fakkaatu qaba.
I need to say.	Jechuun na barbaachisa.
I am by no means the only one who knows this.	Kana kan beeku tasumaa ana qofa miti.
You can have them in there.	Isaan achi keessaa qabaachuu dandeessa.
He hadn't, of course.	Hin qabu ture, beekamaadha.
When this happens.	Yeroo kun ta'u.
It took time, she said.	Yeroo fudhate jette.
He says there will be work for me there.	Achitti hojiin naaf ni jiraata jedha.
Maybe, for a while.	Tarii, yeroo muraasaaf.
Someone has to do it.	Namni tokko gochuu qaba.
You raise your hand.	Harka kee ol qabda.
Now it seems to be working.	Amma waan hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
Give a good time.	Yeroo gaarii kennuu.
You could say there was only one.	Tokko qofa ture jechuu dandeessu.
I don't know when it will happen.	Yoom akka ta'u hin beeku.
I think he’s there.	Inni achi jira jedheen yaada.
She hadn’t noticed that.	Isheen kana hin hubanne turte.
We have a lot in common.	Waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu qabna.
Good kids, both of them.	Ijoollee gaarii, lamaan isaanii.
I knew him now.	Amma isa beeka ture.
He's going to be fine though.	Inni garuu gaarii ta'uuf deema.
This was a dangerous time.	Yeroon kun yeroo balaa qabu ture.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
Please, you have to believe me.	Maaloo, na amanuu qabdu.
But she had no idea where he was.	Garuu eessa akka jiru yaada hin qabdu turte.
But this would be a mistake.	Garuu kun dogoggora ta'a.
You don’t have to believe anything.	Homaa amanuu hin qabdu.
It happened in his own home.	Mana ofii keessatti ta'e.
Perhaps she does.	Tarii ni qabdi taʼa.
No need to respond.	Deebii kennuu hin barbaachisu.
Only until recently.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti qofa.
This time it could be me.	Yeroo kana ana ta'uu danda'a.
Is he a dog or a cat?	Inni saree moo saree?
I love that girl.	Intala sana nan jaalladha.
He could never tell her that.	Inni gonkumaa akkas itti himuu hin dandeenye.
There was little to say.	Wanti jedhu xiqqoo ture.
He lives in a small house with his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa waliin mana xiqqoo tokko keessa jiraata.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Kun akka hin taane garuu ifaadha.
We have to leave them at the door.	Balbala bira isaan dhiisuu qabna.
But someone else had it.	Namni biraa garuu qaba ture.
I didn't want one.	Tokko hin barbaanne.
I don’t know how many days it was.	Guyyaa meeqa akka ture hin beeku.
She was great.	Isheen guddaa turte.
They are still looking for us.	Ammallee nu barbaadaa jiru.
He was completely right, of course.	Guutummaatti sirrii ture, beekamaadha.
I can't say that.	Ani akkas jechuu hin danda'u.
But they are not the same.	Garuu isaan tokko miti.
Shortly after that.	Sana booda yeroo muraasa booda.
I think you need alone time.	Yeroo kophaa kee si barbaachisa jedheen yaada.
Working conditions	Haala hojii .
It took me a little while.	Yeroo xiqqoo natti fudhate.
Just more and more.	Caalaatti qofa.
Nothing happened for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf homaa hin taane.
That doesn’t even need to be said.	Kana jechuun illee hin barbaachisu.
I knew he was coming.	Akka inni dhufu nan beeka ture.
That was some time ago.	Sun yeroo muraasa dura ture.
I just thought about it.	jedheen yaade qofa.
He needed all the help he could get.	Gargaarsa argachuu dandaʼu hunda isa barbaachisa ture.
I couldn't find it.	Argachuu hin dandeenye.
No one is doing our work for us.	Namni hojii keenya nuuf hojjetu hin jiru.
That is still unclear.	Sun ammallee ifa miti.
You can’t see them.	Isaan arguu hin dandeessu.
It was just the two of them.	Isaan lamaan qofa ture.
I said he wasn't there anymore.	Kana booda hin jiru jedheen.
It seemed like a great idea at the time.	Yeroo sanatti yaada guddaa fakkaata ture.
I wouldn’t have liked it.	Silaa hin jaalladhu ture.
Among his children.	Ijoollee isaa keessaa.
Clearly, this is still not true.	Kun ammallee dhugaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
You have no idea how to go about it.	Akkamitti akka itti deemtu yaada tokkollee hin qabdu.
You can't stay here.	As turuu hin dandeessu.
To.	Gara.
Time passed quickly.	Yeroon dafee darbe.
He was in it because of it.	Sababa isaatiin keessa ture.
Perhaps she was wrong.	Tarii dogoggora qabdi turte taʼa.
But he didn’t know enough.	Garuu waan gahaa hin beekne.
He knows how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e ni beeka.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
Things are not easy.	Wanti salphaa miti.
This, of course, is not true.	Kun, dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But I couldn’t find one.	Garuu tokko argachuu hin dandeenye.
But it is not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti.
I’m enjoying it now.	Amma itti gammadeera.
People were looking around.	Namoonni naannoo isaanii ilaalaa turan.
I think of my wife and children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee koo nan yaada.
It wasn’t huge, but it was just what we needed.	Guddaa hin turre, garuu waan nu barbaachisu qofa ture.
You said that.	Ati akkas jette.
But that’s not true.	Garuu sun dhugaa miti.
They were on us.	Isaan nu irra turan.
It’s not a big deal here.	Asitti waan guddaa miti.
He checked his watch again.	Ammas sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
But he still has his.	Garuu ammallee kan isaa qaba.
But I don't understand.	Ani garuu naaf hin galle.
I already know who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e duruu beeka.
But this time, it won't be so easy.	Yeroo kana garuu, akkas salphaa hin ta'u.
It dresses well.	Akka gaariitti uffata.
Three jobs in three months.	Ji'a sadii keessatti hojii sadii.
There is nothing like that.	Homaa akkasii hin jiru.
I thought it was a great idea.	Yaada guddaa natti fakkaate.
Then another passed.	Sana booda kan biraa darbe.
Which he usually is.	Kan inni yeroo baay'ee ta'u.
She had to work in the morning.	Ganama hojjechuu qabdi turte.
One of them was really nice.	Isaan keessaa tokko dhuguma namatti tola ture.
They weren’t hers.	Isaan kan ishee hin turre.
Now that would never happen.	Amma sun gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
I don't want this to ever happen.	Kun yoomiyyuu akka ta'u hin barbaadu.
I couldn’t find him right now.	Yeroo ammaa isa argachuu hin dandeenye.
So good that way.	Kanaaf gaarii akkasitti.
It is in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jira.
He hadn’t seen me.	Na hin argine ture.
There's more inside.	Achi caalaa keessa.
He saw his eyes.	Ija isaa arge.
I didn’t want anyone else.	Nama biraa hin barbaanne.
I would have had none.	Silaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I am after a job.	Ani hojii tokko booda jira.
That you don't know what it is that you know.	Maal akka ta'e akka hin beekne kan ati beektu.
That’s what it was.	Kana turee.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
She is not a mother at all.	Isheen tasumaa haadha miti.
And now, you can say that again.	Ammas, ammas akkas jechuu dandeessa.
We wanted nothing more.	Kana caalaa wanti barbaanne hin jiru.
I just had no idea what to do with them.	Maal akkan isaan godhu qofa yaada hin qabu ture.
But not then.	Garuu yeroo sana miti.
I couldn’t do more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
There was a lot of it.	Baay'een ture.
I just haven’t been here long enough.	Yeroo dheeraa as hin turre qofa.
She said nothing about it, to me.	Isheen waa'ee isaa homaa hin dubbanne, natti.

Not really.	Dhuguma miti.
I love school.	Mana barumsaa nan jaalladha.
I don’t like cars.	Konkolaataa hin jaalladhu.
I’m not there yet.	Ani ammallee achi hin jiru.
Glad to see you.	Si arguu kootti gammadeera.
He needed to go to her.	Gara ishee deemuun isa barbaachisa ture.
You are a good mother.	Ati haadha gaarii dha.
I can't see her well.	Akka gaariitti ishee arguu hin danda'u.
It’s really not like that.	Dhuguma akkas miti.
More than she wants.	Isheen barbaaddu caalaa.
I'm looking for it.	Ani barbaada.
Maybe not ever.	Tarii gonkumaa miti.
I just always have.	Yeroo hundumaa qofa qaba.
He would never have done anything like that.	Silaa waan akkasii gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
But he really did.	Garuu dhuguma ni godhe.
I was at home.	Ani mana ture.
That was your job.	Hojiin kee kanuma ture.
He has no one to love him.	Nama isa jaallatu hin qabu.
But now they have a serious problem.	Garuu amma rakkoo hamaa qabu.
These people loved and needed each other.	Namoonni kun wal jaallatu, wal barbaadu turan.
She is a good dog.	Isheen saree gaarii dha.
Just to be clear.	Ifa ta'uuf qofa.
And I did the same thing.	Anis akkas godhe.
If it were.	Osoo ta'ee.
It will happen on its own.	Ofii isaatiin ni ta'a.
But I didn’t know everything.	Garuu waan hundumaa hin beeku ture.
He always says that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedha.
He has a lot of it.	Baay'ee qaba.
Perhaps she had.	Tarii qabdi turte taʼa.
It seemed like the right answer.	Deebii sirrii ta’e fakkaata ture.
Maybe you didn't know it for me.	Tarii naaf hin beekne ta'a.
It is, and it still isn't.	Ni jira, ammas hin ta'u.
The new one.	Kan haaraa.
Nothing was going his way.	Wanti karaa isaa deemu hin jiru ture.
But maybe not for long.	Garuu tarii yeroo dheeraaf miti.
You are doing the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechaa jirta.
We are in it together.	Waliin keessa jirra.
They even have a distinctive sound about them.	Waa'ee isaanii sagalee adda ta'e illee qabu.
But that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.	Garuu sun waan hamaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I want to find my inner man again.	Nama keessa koo jiru ammas argachuu barbaada.
He was not quite a year old.	Umuriin isaa guutummaatti waggaa tokko hin turre.
Only this week!.	Torban kana qofa!.
We have work to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabnu qabna.
But it was so obvious.	Garuu akkas ifa ture.
What were you doing.	Maal hojjechaa turte.
I don't want to know.	Ani beekuu hin barbaadu.
This is not like you.	Kun akka kee miti.
She became so great.	Akkas guddaa taate.
So I did it.	Kanaaf nan godhe.
But there is a problem here.	Garuu asitti rakkoon jira.
Look at the picture.	Suuraa isaa ilaalaa.
It usually looks like this.	Yeroo baayyee akkas fakkaata.
I still don't know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e ammallee hin beeku.
I want no part of this.	Ani kutaa kanaa tokkollee hin barbaadu.
A month and no more.	Ji'a tokko malee kana caalaa hin jiru.
That can do it.	Sun gochuu danda'a.
That was dangerous.	Sun balaa qaba ture.
Now you know better than this new thing.	Amma wanta haaraa kana caalaa beekta.
Maybe that was nothing.	Tarii sun homaa ture ta'a.
They are not real.	Isaan dhugaa miti.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
Not even a new house.	Mana haaraa illee miti.
He knew something was very wrong.	Waan tokko baay'ee dogoggora akka ta'e beeka ture.
He probably wanted more for you than he had.	Inni tarii waan inni qabu caalaa siif barbaade ta’a.
He is very good.	Inni baayyee gaarii dha.
You are not a good person.	Ati nama gaarii miti.
It's a real book, of course.	Kitaaba dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekamaadha.
People love this place.	Namoonni bakka kana ni jaallatu.
Not that he should ever have, but he did.	Yoomiyyuu qabaachuu qaba jechuu miti, garuu ni qaba ture.
I couldn’t meet him.	Isa waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye.
Until recently .	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti .
A little later.	Xiqqoo booda.
I didn't think it would be like that.	Akkas ta'a jedhee hin yaadne.
That’s not why you’re in here.	Kanaaf miti kan as keessa jirtu.
You can’t live with them.	Isaan waliin jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
Why does he need it? 	Maaliif isa barbaachisa?
. . . .	.
Nothing but trouble.	Rakkoo malee homaa hin jiru.
I don’t think you should be here.	As jiraachuu hin qabdu jedheen yaada.
As good as he did.	Akkuma inni godhe gaarii dha.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
You were like a boy.	Ati akka gurbaa turte.
I'm trying to.	Ani yaalaa jira.
I am very happy now.	Amma baay'een gammadeera.
I love these things.	Wantoota kana nan jaalladha.
We need to get help.	Gargaarsa argachuu qabna.
Became.	Ta'e.
It goes both ways.	Karaa lamaan ni deema.
Someone is at the door.	Namni tokko balbala irra jira.
I enjoyed it tonight.	Halkan kana itti gammade.
He spoke up again.	Ammas ol jedhee dubbate.
No one loved her.	Namni ishee jaallatu hin turre.
But we need to get help.	Garuu gargaarsa argachuu qabna.
You may be wondering what took so long.	Maaltu yeroo dheeraa fudhate jettanii yaaddu taʼa.
He was going to his room.	Gara kutaa isaa deema ture.
She needs it.	Isheen barbaachisa.
We need to work harder.	Caalaatti hojjechuu qabna.
Maybe for hours.	Tarii sa'aatii dheeraaf ta'a.
She had a good life.	Jireenya gaarii qabdi turte.
She said this couldn't happen.	Kun ta'uu hin danda'u jette.
Look at the picture of the dog.	Suuraa saree ilaalaa.
A lot can happen in that moment.	Yeroo sanatti waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a.
It's good for you.	Siif gaarii dha.
But that's not usually the case.	Garuu yeroo baayyee akkas miti.
It will never happen.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
I already have some ideas.	Duraan yaada tokko tokko qaba.
It was a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo ture.
Looks like he can't do that anymore.	Kana booda akkas gochuu hin danda'u fakkaata.
He wanted to know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaade.
It was in your imagination.	Yaada keessan ture.
We are there.	Ni jirra.
There was nothing at all.	Tasumaa wanti tokkollee hin turre.
Now there is no problem.	Amma rakkoon hin jiru.
It worked extremely well.	Garmalee gaarii hojjete.
They are looking the other way.	Karaa biraa ilaalaa jiru.
The largest and.	Kan guddaa fi.
You're most likely.	Ati baay'ee hin oolu.
Sorry about that!.	Dhiifama waa'ee sanaa!.
Now look at them.	Amma isaan ilaalaa.
They don’t have any of their own.	Kan isaanii tokkollee hin qaban.
I think they love each other.	Wal jaallatu jedheen yaada.
I have been here.	Ani as tureera.
This isn’t exactly the case.	Kun sirriitti hin ta’u.
It's nothing else.	Waan biraa miti.
It could just be an accident.	Balaa qofa ta'uu danda'a.
He hadn’t thought about it.	Inni itti hin yaadne ture.
We all had something in common.	Hundi keenya waan wal fakkaatu qabna turre.
It was more important to him than his own life.	Jireenya ofii isaa caalaa isaaf barbaachisaa ture.
He said that.	Akkas jedhe.
It used to be a problem.	Duraan rakkoo ture.
That they no longer are.	Akka isaan kana booda hin taane.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
He really has a way about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa karaa qaba.
What we were is no longer important.	Wanti turre kana booda barbaachisaa miti.
It is necessary to know.	Beekuu barbaachisa.
He has a car.	Konkolaataa qaba.
Someone about.	Namni waa'ee.
But he said nothing.	Inni garuu homaa hin dubbanne.
I couldn't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
Tonight is not one of them.	Halkan kun isaan keessaa tokko miti.
Luckily they want me.	Wanti carraa ta'e na barbaadu.
Then it was a matter of waiting.	Sana booda dhimma eegaa ture.
No one knows the truth.	Dhugaa jiru namni beeku hin jiru.
Walking through time.	Yeroo keessa deemuu.
A lot of things.	Waan baay'ee.
Tomorrow is going to be great.	Boru guddaa ta'uuf deema.
It shouldn’t matter that much.	Hamma kana dhimma qabaachuu hin qabu.
I just didn't want to be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu qofa hin barbaanne.
It would be too bad if that were the case.	Osoo akkas ta'e baay'ee hamaa ta'a.
We are looking at three houses tonight.	Halkan kana mana sadii ilaalaa jirra.
You are great.	Ati guddaa dha.
Why wouldn’t he do it.	Maaliif hin godhu ture.
I don’t think we ever will.	Yoomiyyuu waan goonu natti hin fakkaatu.
We don't care.	Nuti dhimma hin qabnu.
This is a good situation.	Kun haala gaarii dha.
This one isn’t like that.	Inni kun akkas miti.
This can be a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
It shouldn't be a problem.	Rakkoo ta'uu hin qabu.
This was one of them.	Kun tokko ture.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
That’s exactly what we are.	Nuti sirriitti kanuma.
Nothing seemed to have happened.	Wanti ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
It's better to be someone different.	Nama adda ta'uu wayya.
People should stop doing that.	Namoonni akkas gochuu dhiisuu qabu.
No one else was there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namni biraa achi hin turre.
She holds his hand.	Harka isaa qabdi.
But two things went wrong.	Garuu wanti lama dogoggora ta'e.
But they usually do.	Garuu yeroo baayyee hojjetu.
I don’t know what to do with him.	Maal akkan isa godhu hin beeku.
That’s not bad.	Sun hamaa miti.
He knew why he was doing it.	Maaliif akka kana gochaa jiru ni beeka ture.
Why, in my day.	Maaliif, bara kootti.
What they have in common is a door.	Wanti isaan wal fakkaatu balbala.
It worked all right for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hunda sirriitti hojjete.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Akkas ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
He made a lot of money.	Maallaqa hedduu argate.
He knew it wasn't about him.	Waa'ee isaa akka hin taane beeka ture.
But there is no reason.	Garuu sababni hin jiru.
He probably has no idea who you are.	Inni tarii eenyu akka taate yaada tokkollee hin qabu.
He wouldn’t tell me what he found.	Waan argate natti hin himu ture.
An extremely serious case.	Dhimma garmalee hamaa.
Sorry, but that’s not the answer.	Dhiifama, garuu deebii akka hin taane.
Many of us did that.	Baay'een keenya akkas goone.
I don't have this issue.	Ani dhimma kana hin qabu.
I had no idea who she was, or who any of them were.	Eenyu akka taate, isaan keessaa eenyu akka ta’e yaada hin qabu ture.
I know you can’t.	Akka hin dandeenye nan beeka.
It was unclear why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ifa hin taane ture.
I just didn't know much about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beekne qofa ture.
He really has to work to make that happen.	Dhuguma sana akka ta'u gochuuf hojjechuu qaba.
That no one loves me.	Namni tokkollee akka na jaallatu.
Not that I don’t want to, I do.	Hin barbaadu jechuu miti, nan barbaada.
I was kind of unsure about it.	Waa'ee kanaa akka waan mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
So the problem is still relevant.	Kanaaf rakkoon jiru ammallee barbaachisaa dha.
She didn't know why she had to say anything.	Maaliif waan tokko dubbachuu akka qabdu hin beektu turte.
You don’t need to do this, she said.	Kana gochuun si hin barbaachisu jette.
I want to know.	Ani beekuu barbaada.
Who was watching her.	Eenyutu ishee ilaalaa ture.
He has an idea.	Yaada qaba.
You're the only one.	Ati qofa.
Even more so now.	Caalaatti iyyuu amma.
They were here for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf as turan.
Please, you have to believe me now.	Maaloo, amma na amanuu qabda.
Everything had to be his way.	Wanti hundi karaa isaa ta'uu qaba ture.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
But you would never know.	Ati garuu gonkumaa hin beektu turte.
You don’t know everything.	Waan hundumaa hin beektu.
But he was, he will be.	Garuu inni ture, ni ta'a.
Maybe I just don't know how to do it.	Tarii akkamitti akka hojjetu qofa hin beeku ta'a.
He knew exactly what he meant.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade sirriitti beeka ture.
He had a great job.	Hojii guddaa qaba ture.
This is not going to work.	Kun hojjechuuf hin deemu.
We are the only ones.	Nuti qofa jirra.
We are still working.	Ammas hojjechaa jirra.
It’s not a problem at all.	Tasumaa rakkoo hin qabu.
Now, three questions.	Amma, gaaffii sadii.
It was a lot.	Baay'ee ture.
It didn’t seem like a big deal.	Waan guddaa hin fakkaatu ture.
That's not good.	Sun gaarii miti.
That was what it was.	Kana turee maaltu ture.
That’s when it hit me.	Yeroo sanatti natti dhufe.
I still want one.	Ammallee tokko barbaada.
The two already know each other.	Lamaan isaanii duruu wal beeku.
So far.	Hanga ammaatti.
All you had to do was say so.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu akkas jechuu qofa ture.
I wanted to do everything.	Waan hundumaa hojjechuu barbaade.
Not sure what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
He always loved me very much.	Yeroo hundumaa baayʼee na jaallata ture.
And I was just happy.	Anis gammade qofa ture.
I didn't know why it was happening.	Maaliif akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture.
He started well, seemed like a good guy.	Gaarii jalqabe, gurbaa gaarii fakkaata ture.
We are here for you.	Siif as jirra.
It came with nothing.	Homaa tokko malee dhufe.
This was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ture.
I don't think it could be any easier.	Kana caalaa salphaa ta'uu waan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu.
We really can’t.	Dhuguma hin dandeenyu.
It was definitely happening.	Ta'aa akka ture beekamaadha.
Time to go for it.	Yeroon itti deemu.
So, we did the best we could.	Kanaaf, waan dandeenyu hunda hojjenne.
Take a look at this one.	Isa kana mee ilaalaa.
Only a few times!	Yeroo muraasa qofa!
She doesn't have a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee hin qabdu.
We may never know the real answer.	Deebii isa dhugaa gonkumaa beekuu hin dandeenyu taʼa.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
She probably wasn't.	Isheen tarii ta'uu hin oolu.
He looked like my wife.	Haadha manaa koo fakkaata ture.
I don't know what to say.	Waan jedhu hin beeku.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
You can see it, right?.	Arguu dandeessu mitiiree?.
They just didn’t want it.	Isaan qofa hin barbaanne.
I’m watching the kids over there.	Ani achitti ijoollee ilaalaa jira.
Like new.	Akkuma haaraa.
Just being .	Ta'uu qofa .
It's probably going to happen.	Ni ta'uu hin oolu.
You know, it was somewhat of both.	Beektaa, hamma tokko lamaan isaanii ture.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I think this is a great idea.	Kun yaada guddaa natti fakkaata.
I don't even know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
It’s my father.	Abbaa kooti.
I know he knows about us.	Waa'ee keenya akka beeku nan beeka.
This would never work.	Kun gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
This was his favorite part of the job.	Kun kutaa hojii sanaa isa baayʼee jaallatu ture.
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
This is wrong, in his opinion.	Kun dogoggora, akka yaada isaatti.
That was the whole problem.	Rakkoon hundi kanuma ture.
More of a good luck.	Caalaatti carraa gaarii.
You obviously have that.	Sana akka qabdu ifaadha.
I said sure, when.	Anis mirkanaa'aa, yoom jedheen.
you just don’t understand.	siif hin galle qofa.
It really does.	Dhuguma ni godha.
I absolutely love them.	Guutummaatti baay'een isaan jaalladha.
But it couldn't be true.	Garuu dhugaa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
More than the worst.	Hamaa caalaa.
It was too obvious to me.	Garmalee naaf ifa ture.
So it’s not the same thing.	Kanaaf waan tokko miti.
We are all one.	Hundi keenya tokko.
One never knows.	Namni gonkumaa hin beeku.
No one knew them.	Namni isaan beeku hin turre.
But they will be good.	Garuu gaarii ta'u.
He was at work.	Hojii irra ture.
I wanted to matter.	Ani dhimma qabaachuu barbaade.
The reason for this is unclear.	Sababni kanaa ifa miti.
It certainly wasn’t easy.	Salphaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
But even that was fine.	Garuu sun illee gaarii ture.
He said that was a really good idea.	Sun dhuguma yaada gaarii akka ta'e dubbateera.
I didn’t agree with that.	Sana irratti walii hin galle.
I can't eat during the day.	Guyyaa nyaachuu hin danda'u.
It will never happen again.	Amma booda gonkumaa hin ta'u.
Tell me where he is.	Bakka inni jiru natti himi.
He wants me to tell him.	Akkan itti himu barbaada.
For no reason whatsoever.	Sababa tokko malee.
They loved everyone.	Nama hunda ni jaallatu turan.
I'm going to go too.	Anis nan deema.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
They weren’t friends.	Hiriyyoota hin turre.
So that rules him out.	Kanaaf sun isa ala godha.
Very, very few of them.	Isaan keessaa baayyee baayyee muraasa.
Why did he say	Maaliif jedhee .
He wanted to know everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hundumaa beekuu barbaade.
This problem, of course, is not new.	Rakkoon kun, haaraa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That's how it goes.	Akkasitti deema.
This is what is going to happen.	Kan ta'uuf deemu kana.
Should know the exact date later today.	Guyyaa sirrii har'a booda beekuu qaba.
I didn’t mean anything.	Homaa jechuu koo hin turre.
We had some work with this guy.	Gurbaa kana waliin hojii tokko tokko qabna turre.
It was there she had to go.	Achitti ture kan isheen deemuu qabdu.
But it’s good for me.	Garuu naaf gaarii dha.
I used to work here, you know.	Duraan asitti hojjechaa ture beektu.
It was a lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa ture.
Day in, day out.	Guyyaa keessaa, guyyaa keessaa.
I had nothing more to say.	Kana caalaa waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
Being with me.	Na waliin ta'uu.
It didn’t matter at all.	Homaa dhimma hin qabu ture.
It could have been the other way around.	Karaa biraa ta’uu danda’a ture.
That’s all you can do right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana waan ati gochuu dandeessu kana qofa.
Like his episode from all time.	Akkuma kutaa isaa yeroo hundumaa irraa.
But this time, it's different.	Yeroo kana garuu, adda ta'a.
That’s what it was.	Kanuma ture.
It was giving all day.	Guyyaa guutuu kennuu ture.
That's what happens to us.	Kanuma nuuf ta'a.
I don’t need any more friends.	Hiriyyoota kana booda na hin barbaachisu.
That was a huge mistake.	Sun dogoggora guddaa ture.
Then he found it.	Sana booda argate.
We had to be .	Ta'uu qabna turre .
In the old days.	Bara durii.
He’s not a bad guy.	Inni gurbaa hamaa miti.
But it was very bad for me.	Garuu baay'ee natti hamaa ture.
It sounds terrible.	Sagalee hamaa qaba.
It might have been a joke.	Silaa qoosaa ture ta'a.
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
This was a funny morning.	Kun ganama qoosaa ture.
He was tall, good-looking.	Inni dheeraa, nama gaarii ture.
But there is nothing.	Garuu homaa hin jiru.
I thought I could play.	Taphachuu danda'a jedheen yaade.
He made a lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa argate.
One right after the other.	Tokko sirriitti tokko booda.
But I'm never sure.	Garuu gonkumaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
He knows you’re here.	Akka ati as jirtu ni beeka.
You know it, you know.	Ni beekta.
Nothing about that.	Waa'ee sanaa homaa hin qabu.
He seems to need one.	Tokko waan isa barbaachisu fakkaata.
In this way	Haala kanaan .
Someone who knows you.	Nama si beeku.
Never, ever without your book.	Kitaaba kee malee gonkumaa, yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
He could have been a gentleman.	Silaa nama gaarii ta'uu danda'a ture.
Now everything works fine.	Amma wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
They should not have done this.	Kana gochuu hin qaban turan.
Not so much and not so soon.	Akkas baay'ee miti akkas dafee miti.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
But it was really, really great.	Garuu dhuguma, dhuguma guddaa ture.
It doesn't matter what the reality is.	Dhugaa jiru maal akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
Tell her she is a very good person.	Isheen nama baayyee gaarii ta'uu ishee itti himi.
Otherwise it will be fine.	Yoo kana hin taane gaarii ta'a.
He was in it, now.	Inni keessa ture, amma.
I am not like my husband.	Ani akka abbaa manaa koo miti.
She had no idea where he intended to go.	Eessa deemuuf akka yaadu yaada hin qabdu turte.
She was very young.	Baayyee xiqqoo turte.
He had to have it.	Qabaachuu qaba ture.
They had little hope.	Abdii qaban xiqqoo qabu turan.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Waan salphaa hojjechuu miti.
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf.
I haven’t seen him in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa hin argine.
But it was still something.	Garuu ammas waan tokko ture.
It could be wrong, of course.	Dogoggora ta’uu danda’a, beekamaadha.
We just did it.	Nuti hojjenne qofa.
You don't have to go back and not be in it.	Duubatti deebi'uu fi keessa hin turre ta'uu hin qabdu.
We need to be doing things right.	Waan sirriitti hojjechaa jiraachuu qabna.
That's why he thought.	Kanaaf jedhee yaade.
I didn’t really think about it that way.	Dhuguma akkasitti itti hin yaadne.
You are not mine.	Ati kan koo miti.
John loved his new job.	Yohaannis hojii isaa isa haaraa baayʼee jaallata ture.
How this happened, however, is unclear.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'e garuu ifa miti.
Currently.	Yeroo ammaatti.
Everything looks the same but different.	Wanti hundi tokko garuu adda adda fakkaata.
I hope this is a simple obvious mistake.	Kun dogoggora salphaa ifa ta'e akka ta'e abdiin qaba.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I know what you want to ask.	Waan gaafachuu barbaaddu nan beeka.
They are not everything.	Isaan waan hundumaa miti.
Work consumes a large portion of my time.	Hojiin yeroo koo keessaa harka guddaa nyaata.
Should that be asking too much?.	Sun baay'ee gaafachuu qabaa?.
Not his real name.	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa miti.
I can't live like that anymore.	Kana booda akkas jiraachuu hin danda'u.
I’ve always said that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedheen ture.
I really like these people.	Namoota kana baay'een jaalladha.
That was a different time.	Yeroon sun yeroo adda ture.
He hadn't even thought about it.	Inni illee itti hin yaadne ture.
I really mean everyone.	Dhuguma hunda jechuu kooti.
You never know with me.	Ati gonkumaa na waliin hin beektu.
In the room.	Kutaa keessatti.
We can’t see it.	Arguu hin dandeenyu.
It's just one thing.	Waan tokko qofa.
I seem to do this all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa waanan kana godhu natti fakkaata.
But he wasn't there.	Garuu achi hin turre.
I will make it happen.	Ani akka ta'u nan godha.
I was here last year.	Bara darbe as ture.
But something is not quite right.	Garuu wanti guutummaatti sirrii hin taane jira.
It can be very, very large.	Baayyee baayyee guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
But of course not.	Garuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You can stay in it.	Isa keessa turuu ni dandeessa.
Just out of everything.	Waan hundumaa keessaa ba'e qofa.
It was new.	Haaraa ture.
On the big issue of the day.	Dhimma guddaa guyyaa sanaa irratti.
They just have each other.	Wal qofa qabu.
You should be fine then.	Yeroo sanatti gaarii ta'uu qabda.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Kun akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
He stared at me for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ija keessa na ilaale.
It seemed like maybe he didn't.	Tarii waan hin goone fakkaata ture.
But he was right.	Inni garuu sirrii ture.
What people need to see and know most.	Namoonni maal arguu fi beekuu qaban hunda caalaa.
It could be his own.	Kan isaa ta'uu danda'a.
He was very good to me.	Inni baay'ee naaf gaarii ture.
He was work, my father.	Inni hojii ture abbaa koo.
You can’t live like us.	Akka keenya jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
No one has ever given me as much as you.	Namni hanga kee naaf kenne hin beeku.
He’s not really into it.	Inni dhuguma keessa hin jiru.
I am not yours.	Ani kan kee miti.
It couldn't have been good.	Gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I’m not just talking.	Ani dubbachuu qofa miti.
No one should go.	Namni deemuu hin qabu.
I'm looking at it.	Ani ilaalaa jira.
We need to do this often.	Kana yeroo baay’ee gochuu qabna.
More than ever.	Yeroo hunda caalaa.
The good one.	Kan gaarii.
Is there something going on?	Wanti ta'aa jiru jiraa?
It's a terrible thing.	Waan hamaa.
We realized it was going to be a boy.	Gurbaa ta'uuf akka jiru hubanne.
They are in that position.	Isaan bakka sana jiru.
I don't know what that means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku.
The only thing that matters is that you have it.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e qabaachuu kee qofa.
She can’t tell anyone how she feels.	Miira ishee namatti himuu hin dandeessu.
She can’t believe it.	Isheen amanuu hin dandeessu.
I do it often.	Yeroo baayʼee nan godha.
She was going to be fine.	Isheen gaarii ta'uuf turte.
That shouldn't be the case.	Sun ta'uu hin qabu.
I already have enough money.	Duraan qarshii gahaa qaba.
Everything went very smoothly.	Wanti hundi baayyee sirriitti deeme.
This was unreasonable.	Kun sababa hin qabne ture.
What time is it now?	Amma yeroon isaa meeqa?
We have three children.	Ijoollee sadii qabna.
He knew that voice.	Sagalee sana ni beeka ture.
He was with them.	Isaan waliin ture.
It was her mother's.	Kan haadha ishee ture.
But he didn’t like me.	Garuu na hin jaallatu ture.
He asked several friends, but none had answers.	Hiriyyoota hedduu gaafate, garuu tokkollee deebii hin qaban.
I want to get that money.	Maallaqa sana argachuu nan barbaada.
It was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture.
There is nothing he doesn’t do.	Wanti inni hin goone hin jiru.
I never knew you could do this.	Kana gochuu akka dandeessu gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
Except that one other time, two years ago.	Yeroo biraa tokko sana malee, waggaa lama dura.
They are really going for it.	Dhuguma itti deemaa jiru.
I wouldn't have been that person.	Silaa nama sana hin ta'u ture.
But it shouldn't be like that.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
He was just doing his thing.	Inni waan isaa hojjechaa ture qofa ture.
And I, can't believe this!	Anis, kana amanuu hin danda'u!
They always do it.	Yeroo hundumaa ni hojjetu.
He wasn’t himself.	Inni ofii isaa hin turre.
Someone who is different.	Nama adda ta'e.
Very sorry.	Baayyee dhiifama.
We still can’t do that.	Ammallee akkas gochuu hin dandeenyu.
That's just the way it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qabu qofa.
Everyone could see that.	Namni hundi sana arguu dandaʼa ture.
But this time it was different.	Yeroo kana garuu adda ture.
It’s the best one.	Isa gaarii dha.
You have to make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuu qabda.
We worked together.	Waliin hojjenne.
They know each other, they are together.	Wal beeku, waliin jiru.
I knew you had it.	Akka qabdu nan beeka ture.
Why does he do such a thing.	Maaliif waan akkasii hojjeta.
She was there.	Achi turte.
I couldn't even scream.	Iyyuu illee hin dandeenye.
Maybe it never happened.	Tarii gonkumaa hin taane ta'a.
I don't want to.	Ani hin barbaadu.
But there is more to it.	Kana caalaa garuu jira.
It was wrong then and it is wrong now.	Yeroo sana dogoggora ture ammas dogoggora.
What he was trying to do.	Waan inni gochuuf yaalaa ture.
It is still in operation.	Ammas hojii irra jira.
I knew he meant me.	Ana jechuu isaa nan beeka ture.
I don't have a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee hin qabu.
This man has no money.	Namni kun qarshii hin qabu.
I think that's the most appropriate thing to do.	Wanti gochuun hunda caalaa sirrii ta'e sun natti fakkaata.
They really do the job.	Dhuguma hojii hojjetu.
Maybe we are making a mistake.	Tarii dogoggora hojjechaa jirra ta'a.
Some people were going.	Namoonni tokko tokko deemaa turan.
That’s nothing new.	Sun waan haaraa miti.
He is very happy.	Inni baay'ee gammadeera.
That's going to be great.	Sun waan guddaa ta'uuf deema.
I know someone like that.	Nama akkasii nan beeka.
Playing with him.	Isa waliin taphachuu.
Clearly, we will never agree.	Yoomiyyuu akka walii hin galle ifaadha.
But that was different.	Garuu sun adda ture.
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
He will probably do it again.	Ammas gochuun isaa hin oolu.
Everything happened very quickly.	Wanti hundi baayyee dafee ta'e.
I don’t want to.	Hin barbaadu.
No one even spoke.	Namni dubbate illee hin jiru.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I am in a fortunate position.	Ani haala carraa qabu keessa jira.
It's not just about me.	Waa'ee koo qofa miti.
It was a terrible time.	Yeroon sun yeroo hamaa ture.
You are in the light.	Ati ifa keessa jirta.
I don’t want to live anywhere else.	Bakka biraa jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
I didn't want to talk about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
I just couldn’t leave them there.	Achitti isaan dhiisuu qofa hin dandeenye.
Just soon please.	Yeroo dhiyootti qofa maaloo.
With the girl.	Intala waliin.
That can't work.	Sun hojjechuu hin danda'u.
You wouldn’t do that, would you?	Silaa akkas hin gootu mitii?
Nothing like that happened.	Wanti akkasii hin taane.
It happens for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
That’s not what you want to do in this case.	Sun waan ati dhimma kana keessatti gochuu barbaaddu miti.
That happened quite often.	Sun yeroo baayʼee ni taʼa ture.
But it is not the whole truth.	Garuu dhugaa guutuu miti.
So he took a chance.	Kanaaf carraa fudhate.
He was alone in the room at the time.	Yeroo sanatti kutaa sana keessa kophaa isaa ture.
But it really does.	Garuu dhuguma ni qaba.
Maybe that will never happen.	Tarii sun gonkumaa hin ta'u ta'a.
He should have gone to me.	Silaa gara kootti deemuu qaba ture.
Had bad luck with the car.	Konkolaataa waliin carraa hamaa qaba ture.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
But, he did, didn't he?'.	Garuu, ni godhe mitiiree?'.
We cannot do that here.	Asitti akkas gochuu hin dandeenyu.
Today, however, will be different.	Har'a garuu adda ta'a.
I don’t know what else to say.	Kan biraa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku.
I don’t know how to do this.	Kana akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
It means the good ones.	Kan gaarii jechuu dha.
But it matters here.	Garuu asitti dhimma qaba.
I have a lot of work to do here.	Asitti hojiin baay'ee qaba.
But that doesn't mean there is no one.	Garuu namni hin jiru jechuu miti.
No job, no money.	Hojii hin qabu, qarshii hin qabu.
But sometimes, you don’t know.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko, hin beektu.
I'm really sorry.	Dhuguma dhiifama.
She was special to him.	Isheen isaaf adda turte.
She is important.	Isheen barbaachisaa dha.
But this one did.	Inni kun garuu ni godhe.
It was nothing, though.	Homaa hin turre garuu.
Thus, you .	Akkasitti, ati .
He still doesn't like it.	Ammas hin jaallatu.
I love this book so much.	Kitaaba kana baay'een jaalladha.
What do I need?	Ani maaltu na barbaachisa.
I know you will do what you can.	Waan dandeessu akka gootu nan beeka.
We are still here.	Ammas as jirra.
I can't go back, I know that much.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u, hamma sana beeka.
Not now and maybe not anymore.	Amma miti tarii kana booda miti.
Today was the exception.	Har'a garuu kanaan ala ture.
I love his work so much.	Hojii isaa baay'een jaalladha.
Her problem is with me.	Rakkoon ishee ana bira jira.
It was easier this way.	Haala kanaan salphaa ture.
I still can't believe it.	Ammallee amanuu hin danda'u.
I didn't see it.	Hin argine.
He didn’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabu ture.
He has a dog with him.	Saree tokko of biraa qaba.
But this was rarely the case.	Garuu kun yeroo muraasaaf kan ta'u ture.
You were lucky.	Carraa qabda turte.
They were that good.	Isaan akkas gaarii turan.
I have two questions.	Gaaffii lama qaba.
It just has to give hope.	Abdii kennuu qofa qaba.
There is no more '.	Kana booda hin jiru '.
He is nothing.	Inni homaa miti.
We are just too much .	Nuti baay'ee qofa .
It happened a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ta'e.
It was a new year.	Bara haaraa ture.
People are watching.	Namoonni ilaalaa jiru.
You have to give everything.	Waan hundumaa kennuu qabda.
She didn't quite know what he meant.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade sirriitti hin beektu turte.
I never thought it would happen that day.	Guyyaa sanatti ni ta'a jedhee hin beeku.
Not very often.	Yeroo baayyee miti.
I hope it's nothing.	Homaa akka ta'e abdii qaba.
I had the same reaction as you.	Anis akkuma kee deebii wal fakkaatu qaba ture.
It may be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
It was a joke.	Qoosaa ture.
But that doesn’t matter.	Garuu sun homaa hin qabu.
I hadn't thought about it before.	Kanaan dura waa'ee isaa hin yaadne ture.
He says they have your name.	Maqaa kee qaban jedha.
He may be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
They’re just not as lucky as we are.	Isaan akka keenya carraa hin qaban qofa.
I thought something about him didn't seem right.	Waa'ee isaa waan tokko sirrii hin fakkaatu jedheen yaade.
He was right.	Inni sirrii ture.
A lot of things happened.	Waan baay'een ta'e.
He was the father of many children.	Abbaa ijoollee hedduu ture.
Then he became funny.	Sana booda nama qoosaa ta'e.
It seemed more dangerous.	Balaa kan qabu caalaatti isa fakkaata ture.
Then everyone but me can go back.	Sana booda ana malee namni hundi deebi'uu danda'a.
He could have done that.	Kana gochuu dandaʼa ture.
I’m glad I did it.	Hojjechuu kootti gammadeera.
I don’t like cats.	Ani saree hin jaalladhu.
This was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ture.
I almost want to say they have too many ideas.	Yaada garmalee qaban jechuu barbaada jechuun ni danda'ama.
But he is none of that.	Inni garuu sana keessaa tokkollee miti.
And I did it, too.	Anis nan godhe.
I still don't understand.	Ammallee naaf hin galle.
One.	Tokko.
We didn’t have to do anything.	Waan tokko gochuun nu hin barbaachifne.
They love children.	Ijoollee ni jaallatu.
It goes where you go.	Bakka ati deemtu ni deema.
You weren’t there.	Ati hin turre.
This would happen.	Kun ni ta'a ture.
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
That eye, that eye.	Ija sana, ija sana.
But that was asking too much of her.	Garuu sun garmalee ishee gaafachuu ture.
I couldn’t stay here long.	Yeroo dheeraa as turuu hin dandeenye.
I don't want to be again.	Ammas ta'uu hin barbaadu.
Must.	Dirqama.
They are trying to do this.	Kana gochuuf yaalaa jiru.
It must be something like that.	Waan akkasii ta'uu qaba.
What can I tell you.	Maal sitti himi.
He told her he didn’t intend to do that.	Akkas gochuuf akka hin yaadne itti hime.
I've never been big on friends.	Hiriyyoota irratti guddaa ta'ee hin beeku.
It seemed to be everywhere.	Bakka hunda waan jiru fakkaata ture.
Then something happens.	Sana booda wanti tokko ni ta'a.
But you can't go back.	Garuu duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
They don’t really care about you.	Isaan dhuguma siif dhimma hin qaban.
Perhaps that time is now.	Tarii yeroon sun amma taʼuu dandaʼa.
New Year's Eve.	Bara haaraa.
But that doesn’t mean it took all the time.	Garuu yeroo hunda fudhate jechuu miti.
That is, the.	Kana jechuun.
But he doesn't.	Garuu inni hin ta'u.
But there was obviously someone in the house.	Garuu mana keessa namni tokko akka ture ifaadha.
But we have some ideas.	Garuu yaada tokko tokko qabna.
He wouldn’t need it anymore.	Silaa kana booda isa hin barbaachisu ture.
I certainly knew that.	Kana akkan beeku beekamaadha.
True! 	Dhugaa!
Someone knew about money.	Waa'ee qarshii namni tokko beeka ture.
I was only there three days.	Guyyaa sadii qofa achi ture.
They could see me.	Isaan na arguu dandaʼu turan.
Who knows, maybe you are the lucky one.	Eenyutu beeka tarii ati nama carraa qabu ta'uu dandeessa.
That none of them matter.	Akka isaan keessaa tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
This is a mistake.	Kun dogoggora.
Now we were on to something.	Amma waan tokko irra turre.
Not too sure.	Garmalee mirkanaa'aa miti.
It must be internal.	Kan keessaa ta'uu qaba.
Some thought that was too much.	Tokko tokko sun baayʼee waan taʼe itti fakkaate.
Sometimes that’s what you want.	Yeroo tokko tokko waan ati barbaaddu kanuma.
It was a terrible place.	Bakka hamaa ture.
It worked so well.	Akka malee hojjete.
She was one of my favorite people back in the day.	Bara sanatti namoota ani jaalladhu keessaa tokko turte.
He was in trouble here.	Asitti rakkoo keessa ture.
We can’t do it both ways.	Karaa lamaan gochuu hin dandeenyu.
That's how it's going to be.	Akkas ta'uuf deema.
He wanted to stay inside.	Inni keessa turuu barbaade.
Look at it from their eyes.	Ija isaanii irraa ilaalaa.
No one can know.	Namni beekuu hin danda'u.
He is right about one thing.	Waan tokko irratti sirrii dha.
I passed it three times.	Yeroo sadii bira darbe.
It was bright.	Ifa ture.
I didn’t know her name.	Maqaa ishee hin beeku ture.
It's not the same thing.	Waan tokko miti.
He doesn't tell us anything.	Homaa nutti hin himu.
They just want to survive.	Jiraachuu qofa barbaadu.
I wouldn't have said it.	Silaa hin jedhu ture.
You have another long day ahead of you.	Guyyaa dheeraa biraa si dura jira.
She really is bright.	Dhuguma isheen ifaadha.
It’s not just here.	As qofa miti.
Love your friends.	Hiriyyoota kee jaalladhu.
That’s never happened before, never.	Sun kanaan dura ta’ee hin beeku, ta’ee hin beeku.
It’s not just the road.	Karaa qofa miti.
We still didn't talk.	Ammas wal hin dubbanne.
Maybe it shouldn't be.	Tarii ta'uu hin qabu ta'a.
I mean, not at all.	Tasumaa miti jechuu kooti.
He should have known better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
I can do that, you know.	Ani akkas gochuu nan danda'a, beekta.
Now he looked up.	Amma ol ilaale.
He thought about it.	Itti yaade.
He was obviously better than everyone else.	Inni nama hundumaa caalaa akka ture ifaadha.
He didn’t have anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin qabu ture.
One person is mostly irrelevant.	Namni tokko barbaachisaa hin taane ta’uu irra caalaa.
He is good at everything.	Waan hundumaa irratti gaarii dha.
It was indeed.	Dhuguma ture.
I just have a couple of suggestions.	Yaada tokko lama qofa qaba.
Very good stuff.	Waan baayyee gaarii.
Who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e.
But no one knew this.	Garuu namni kana beeku hin turre.
There’s someone else you need to see.	Nama biraa arguu qabdu jira.
I couldn’t do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
Otherwise you may not do my job.	Yoo kana hin taane hojii koo hojjechuu dhiisuu dandeessa.
Seems.	Fakkaata.
You can tell him from the spot.	Bakka irraa isa beekuu dandeessa.
But this was still this good.	Garuu kun ammallee kun gaarii ture.
That's what happened.	Kan ta'e kanuma.
Every bit of what he wanted.	Waan akka inni barbaade xiqqoo xiqqoo.
This is a good thing	Kun waan gaarii dha .
Everything was great.	Wanti hundi guddaa ture.
But I know better than to ask me too many questions.	Garuu gaaffii baay'ee na gaafachuu caalaa beeka.
We don’t have a dog.	Saree hin qabnu.
No one could do that anymore.	Kana booda namni akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
They are doing something else.	Waan biraa hojjechaa jiru.
We have to go.	Deemu qabna.
I don’t need anyone else.	Nama biraa na hin barbaachisu.
Some people knew, but not many.	Namoonni tokko tokko ni beeku turan, garuu baay'ee miti.
It was a great job.	Hojii guddaa ture.
He’s lucky, that one.	Inni carraa qaba, isa sana.
There is no reason to do it here.	Asitti sababni itti goonu hin jiru.
What could be more!?.	Kana caalaa maaltu jira!?.
You know what you did.	Waan goote ni beekta.
I mean, she is.	Isheen jechuu kooti.
Maybe I shouldn’t have done anything.	Tarii homaa gochuu hin qabu ture.
I couldn’t live with myself.	Of waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
Then, the most important thing.	Sana booda, waan hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta’e.
One person	Namni tokko .
Where were they?.	Eessa turan?.
I love that so much.	Sana baay'een jaalladha.
I think you know her.	Ati ishee beektu natti fakkaata.
But as.	Garuu akka.
Which was perfectly fine for me, obviously.	Kan naaf guutummaatti gaarii ture, ifaadha.
With him, you never knew.	Isa waliin, ati gonkumaa hin beekne.
More now, even more than that.	Amma caalaa, sana caalaa illee.
Too late, too late, too late.	Yeroo booda, yeroon booda, yeroon booda.
That wasn’t so bad.	Sun akkas hamaa hin turre.
It looks a little bad in there.	Achi keessaa xiqqoo hamaa fakkaata.
It was with someone else.	Kan nama biraa waliin ture.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'ee itti gammade.
It was really obvious.	Dhuguma ifa ture.
It does this well.	Kana akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I didn't go.	Ani hin deemne.
But then it wasn’t.	Garuu sana booda hin turre.
Who are they?	Isaan eenyu?
In just three days.	Guyyaa sadii qofa keessatti.
This is completely wrong.	Kun guutummaatti dogoggora.
What he didn’t know was why.	Wanti inni hin beekne maaliif akka ta’e ture.
But it wouldn’t come.	Garuu hin dhufu ture.
It didn’t seem to matter.	Dhimma waan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
This should be the answer.	Kun deebii ta’uu qaba.
Man walking a small dog.	Namni saree xiqqoo tokko deemaa jiru.
I was perfect.	Ani guutuu ture.
But you have to come.	Garuu dhufuu qabda.
This one was my favorite.	Inni kun kan ani baay'ee jaalladhu ture.
But no one does.	Namni godhu garuu hin jiru.
You have to give one.	Tokko kennuu qabda.
Nothing like that was necessary.	Wanti akkasii barbaachisaa hin turre.
I certainly can have it.	Ani qabaachuu akkan danda'u beekamaadha.
It was a great room.	Kutaa guddaa ture.
I don’t think he does.	Inni waan godhu natti hin fakkaatu.
Right.	Sirrii.
They are all on it.	Hundi isaanii irra jiru.
You knew better.	Ati caalaatti beekta turte.
You know her situation.	Haala ishee ni beektu.
After that day, no one answered.	Guyyaa sana booda namni deebii kenne hin jiru.
Nothing really happened.	Dhuguma wanti ta'e hin jiru.
Life.	Jireenya.
They can be of some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko gochuu dandaʼu.
He is at home with his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa waliin mana jira.
I just didn't know how or why.	Akkamitti fi maaliif akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture.
She’s not the only one.	Ishee qofa miti.
Then this would not have happened.	Sana booda silaa kun hin ta'u ture.
There is no work for you there.	Achitti hojiin siif hin jiru.
I was just a human being.	Ani nama qofa ture.
Except for a few.	Muraasa malee.
I went everywhere with my father.	Abbaa koo waliin bakka hunda deeme.
He is not good.	Inni gaarii miti.
They don’t have kids together .	Ijoollee waliin hin qaban .
I know that it is.	Akka ta'e nan beeka.
That’s right there.	Sun sirriitti achi jira.
No one told me to go.	Namni akkan deemu natti hime hin turre.
Perhaps she was right.	Tarii isheen sirrii turte taʼa.
He knew he had to do something.	Waan gochuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
I have no idea what to say.	Waan jedhu yaada hin qabu.
But now they worked well together.	Amma garuu akka gaariitti waliin hojjechaa turan.
Maybe it's my wife.	Tarii haadha manaa koo ta'uu danda'a.
I was fine.	Ani gaarii ture.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
But many of them do.	Garuu baay'een isaanii ni godhu.
He is still in danger.	Ammallee balaa keessa jira.
It seems to be another era.	Bara biraa waan taate fakkaata.
This looked pretty good.	Kun baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
We went there last year.	Bara darbe achi deemne.
I was nothing.	Ani homaa hin turre.
You think he’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii sitti fakkaata.
It should have been easy.	Silaa salphaa ta'uu qaba ture.
It could be too big for him.	Isaaf baay'ee guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
It can still be nothing.	Ammallee homaa ta’uu danda’a.
You can’t help yourself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
So, go this way.	Kanaaf, karaa kanaan deemaa.
Just wait for that.	Sana qofa eegaa.
Someone had to get lucky.	Namni tokko carraa argachuu qaba ture.
Maybe it's not just money.	Tarii maallaqa qofa miti ta'a.
That's right.	Sun sirrii dha.
But things are not like that.	Garuu wanti akkas miti.
You really don't know what it's about yet.	Dhuguma waa'ee maal akka ta'e ammallee hin beektu.
We wanted to see that happen.	Akkas akka ta'u arguu barbaanne.
I really don’t need it.	Dhuguma na hin barbaachisu.
I still don't agree.	Ammas walii hin galle.
I didn't know what that thing was.	Wanti sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
He knows everything.	Waan hundumaa ni beeka.
He certainly didn’t do it alone.	Kophaa isaa akka hin goone beekamaadha.
Where he is when he is not with you.	Bakka inni jiru yeroo inni si waliin hin jirre.
Clearly, this was nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa akka hin turre ifaadha.
This is what makes us human.	Wanti nama nu godhe kana.
But then, no one does.	Garuu sana booda, namni tokkollee hin godhu.
It didn’t go that way this time.	Yeroo kana akkasitti hin deemne.
We need some time here.	Asitti yeroo muraasa nu barbaachisa.
She should have just gone home.	Silaa qofa gara manaatti deebi'uu qabdi turte.
It wasn’t even a new grant.	Gargaarsa haaraa illee hin turre.
They are easy to make and look good.	Hojjechuuf salphaa fi gaarii fakkaatu.
The reason for this is unclear.	Sababni kanaa ifa miti.
Maybe not, but it happens.	Tarii ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a, garuu ni ta’a.
Hopefully it will be of help.	Gargaarsa akka ta'u abdii qabna.
It wasn’t just one voice.	Sagalee tokko qofa hin turre.
I don't have a good voice.	Ani sagalee gaarii hin qabu.
I don't care about him.	Ani waa'ee isaaf dhimma hin qabu.
She, hadn't told anything.	Isheen, homaa hin himne turte.
But for him, it had to be true.	Isaaf garuu dhugaa ta'uu qaba ture.
I hope you are doing well.	Akka gaariitti akka jirtu abdiin qaba.
A lot of it was lucky.	Baay'een isaa carraa kan argate ture.
He must have them.	Isaan qabaachuu qaba.
You don't want to be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu hin barbaaddu.
She was fine.	Isheen gaarii turte.
He got a lot of it.	Baay'ee isaa argate.
He wasn't there.	Achi hin turre.
But other than that, everything was fine.	Garuu kanaan ala wanti hundi gaarii ture.
The best way.	Karaa gaarii.
Then he looked up at her.	Sana booda ol jedhee ishee ilaale.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
Everything happens now.	Wanti hundi amma ta'a.
I would like your opinion.	Yaada keessan nan barbaada.
That's how we went.	Akkasitti deemne.
It was a promise.	Waadaa ture.
I can't tell you anything.	Homaa sitti himuu hin danda'u.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
It wasn’t even an idea.	Yaada illee hin turre.
But that’s not the only problem.	Rakkoon jiru garuu kanuma qofa miti.
I have them.	Ani isaan qaba.
Then now.	Sana booda amma.
You said you were a good girl.	Ati intala gaarii dha jette.
But that he wanted them.	Garuu akka isaan barbaade.
But not in this way.	Garuu haala kanaan miti.
But he was there.	Inni garuu achi ture.
It’s just my luck.	Carraa koo qofa.
Probably a couple of weeks.	Torban lama lama ta'uu hin oolu.
They have a very good reputation.	Baayyee maqaa gaarii qabu.
Just the whole thing.	Guutuu qofa.
Now she doesn’t want him to go.	Amma akka inni deemu hin barbaaddu.
So we don’t do it.	Kanaaf hin goonu.
Tell him everything you have to say.	Waan dubbachuu qabdu hunda itti himi.
It wasn’t too bad.	Baayyee hamaa hin turre.
I didn't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabu ture.
I can stay somewhere else tonight.	Halkan kana bakka biraa turuu nan danda'a.
It’s not how it works anymore.	Kana booda akkamitti akka hojjetu miti.
I already knew all that.	Sana hunda kanaan dura beeka ture.
It didn’t work anymore.	Kana booda hin hojjenne.
Someone has it.	Namni tokko qaba.
That’s all that’s needed.	Kan barbaachisu kana qofa.
But he doesn't give a reason.	Garuu sababa hin himu.
But it’s not your problem.	Garuu rakkoo keessan miti.
I think he's doing a pretty good job.	Hojii baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jira jedheen yaada.
I'm not good at this.	Ani kana irratti ga'umsa hin qabu.
We have to do that.	Sana gochuu qabna.
It was all in her eyes, in her voice.	Kun hundi ija ishee keessa, sagalee ishee keessa ture.
Everything you want to know on the subject.	Dhimma kana irratti waan beekuu barbaaddu hunda.
But she had to do so much.	Garuu hamma kana gochuu qabdi turte.
You think of nothing but your food.	Nyaata kee malee homaa hin yaaddu.
They know where they were.	Bakka turan ni beeku.
You should have stayed with me.	Silaa na bira turuu qabda turte.
I wouldn’t want to come to.	Ani gara dhufuu hin barbaadu ture.
If it is necessary.	Yoo dirqama ta'e.
It’s nothing more than that.	Kana caalaa homaa miti.
It was just too real.	Garmalee dhugaa qofa ture.
I have nothing to say about her, nothing in common with her.	Ani waan isheen jedhu hin qabu, waan ishee waliin wal fakkaatu hin qabu.
He was a nice guy.	Inni namatti tola ture.
I can't do anything but live with it.	Waliin jiraachuu malee homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
Next month they will want something else.	Ji'a dhufu waan biraa ni barbaadu.
I'm sure you'd love to be with me.	Na waliin jiraachuu akka jaallattu mirkanaa'adha.
I wasn’t there.	Ani hin turre.
He would be home in a week.	Torban tokko booda mana jiraata ture.
It took a few hours.	Sa'aatii muraasa itti fudhate.
I almost did it tonight.	Halkan kana gochuuf jedheen ture.
He was just doing his job.	Hojii isaa qofa hojjechaa ture.
I went through the same thing.	Anis kanuma keessa darbe.
I have you in today.	Har'a keessa si qaba.
someone asked.	namni tokko gaafate.
Look at me!	Na ilaalaa!
But look at the boys.	Garuu gurbaa ilaalaa.
He didn't say anything about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin dubbanne.
It is a very important thing.	Waan baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
You know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekta.
It must be late.	Yeroo booda ta'uu qaba.
Hope is one thing.	Abdiin waan tokko.
I can be that guy.	Ani gurbaa sana ta'uu nan danda'a.
They are making fun of themselves.	Of qoosaa jiru.
I'm doing that.	Ani akkas gochaa jira.
I know your names.	Maqaa keessan nan beeka.
Like, really great.	Akka, dhuguma guddaa.
He wants me to be in a girl.	Intala keessa akkan ta'u barbaada.
I was fine.	Ani gaarii ture.
I'll go with you.	Si waliin nan deema.
I don't have many friends.	Hiriyyoota baay'ee hin qabu.
I think a lot of people do.	Namoonni baay'een ni godhu jedheen yaada.
They had their big voices.	Sagalee isaanii guddaa qabu turan.
This is what really happened.	Dhuguma kan ta'e kana.
That's when it happens.	Yeroo sanatti ta'a.
I don't like her very much.	Baay'ee ishee hin jaalladhu.
I still have a couple of things.	Ammallee waan tokko lama qaba.
None of that matters anymore.	Kana booda wanti sun tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
I know your wife.	Haadha manaa kee nan beeka.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
But it had happened before.	Kana dura garuu ta'ee ture.
I can't see them.	Isaan arguu hin danda'u.
It’s not an issue.	Dhimma miti.
They can do it themselves.	Ofii isaanii gochuu danda'u.
I wondered what he was doing.	Maal hojjechaa jira jedheen yaade.
No one understood.	Namni hubate hin jiru.
Then he realized.	Sana booda hubate.
He looked inside.	Keessa ilaale.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Kana jechuun homaa jechuu miti.
He was walking down the street.	Karaa irra deemaa ture.
It was all around them.	Naannoo isaanii hunda ture.
Such as the present.	Kan akka ammaa.
Only one though.	Tokko qofa garuu.
Good people.	Namoota gaarii.
I know what that feels like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
I am one.	Ani tokko.
He is still here.	Ammas as jira.
He thought they were better.	Isaan wayya jedhee yaade.
Something about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan tokko.
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
What you need.	Waan isin barbaachisu.
You still have no idea what it means to live that life.	Jireenya sana jiraachuu jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e ammallee yaada hin qabdu.
It was something that happened.	Waan ta'ee ture.
He could work with these people.	Namoota kana waliin hojjechuu danda'a ture.
It’s as clear as day.	Akkuma guyyaa ifaadha.
Sometimes funny.	Yeroo tokko tokko qoosaa.
I don't even know if it's just these things.	Wantoota kana qofa ta'uu isaanii illee hin beeku.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
All of them.	Hundi isaanii.
You must come with me.	Ana waliin dhufuu qabda.
As a wife.	Akka haadha manaatti.
But no one is there.	Garuu namni achi hin jiru.
Where they should be, what they should do.	Bakka ta'uu qabu, maal gochuu qabu.
Three weeks seemed like three months.	Torban sadii kan ji'a sadii fakkaata ture.
I would have had none of it.	Ani garuu silaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
While you were interested, you were watching me.	Osoo ati fedhii qabduu na ilaalaa turte.
He didn’t have it in him.	Inni of keessaa hin qabu ture.
She must know everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu qabdi.
Why is it so important.	Maaliif akkas barbaachisaa ta'e.
It was a car accident.	Balaa konkolaataa ture.
Sometimes they went to each other's houses.	Yeroo tokko tokko mana walii deemaa turan.
I looked up at my parents.	Ol jedheen warra koo ilaale.
He wasn’t there.	Inni hin jiru ture.
You said it, for sure.	Ati jette, mirkanaa'aa ta'a.
I was very excited.	Baayyee natti gammade.
No one can ask them.	Namni isaan gaafachuu hin danda'u.
He didn't know what to think of it.	Maal akka itti yaadu hin beekne.
Must.	Dirqama.
How much your father or mine.	Meeqa abbaa kee moo kan koo.
No one wants it.	Namni barbaadu hin jiru.
You have to tell me what happened.	Waan ta'e natti himuu qabda.
She was in a very bad situation.	Haala baayyee hamaa keessa turte.
This didn’t work this time though.	Kun yeroo kana garuu hin hojjenne.
What he knows, he knows.	Waan beeku, ni beeka.
The two children are identical.	Ijoollee lamaan wal fakkaatu.
I really don't have it.	Dhuguma hin qabu.
But she knew nothing about it.	Isheen garuu waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beektu turte.
A great day.	Guyyaa guddaa.
I can't talk at length.	Dheeraa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
It was good out there.	Achi ala gaarii ture.
Tom wanted a new job.	Toomin hojii haaraa barbaade.
But he hadn’t done anything like that.	Garuu waan akkasii hin hojjenne ture.
It wasn’t so bad last year, was it?	Bara darbe akkas hamaa hin turre mitiiree?
No one asked him questions.	Namni gaaffii isa gaafate hin jiru.
Not much else happened.	Wanti biraa baay'een hin taane.
Mood.	Haala.
This time there was no such luck.	Yeroo kana carraan akkasii hin turre.
But that stuff was pretty good.	Garuu wanti sun baayyee gaarii ture.
He was here, he was at the house.	As ture, mana sanatti ture.
At the time this seemed to be the case.	Yeroo sanatti kun waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
This is not just dedication.	Kun of kennuu qofa miti.
Always on her terms.	Yeroo hundumaa haala ishee irratti.
Look at it like this.	Akkasitti ilaalaa.
How did that happen?.	Sun akkamitti ta'e?.
You can’t do your job.	Hojii kee hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
It couldn't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeenye.
He was that good.	Inni akkas gaarii ture.
He loves his children.	Ijoollee isaa ni jaallata.
He seemed to know exactly what he was doing.	Waan godhu sirriitti waan beeku fakkaata ture.
It’s not your truth.	Dhugaa kee miti.
That was all he needed.	Kan isa barbaachisu kana qofa ture.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
I think it should work.	Hojjechuu qaba jedheen yaada.
He thought it was just like him.	Akkuma isaa ta'e jedhee yaade.
So, we won’t do that in this case.	Kanaaf, haala kana keessatti akkas hin goonu.
But, one day, it will happen.	Garuu, guyyaa tokko, ni ta'a.
You’re always trying to do the right thing.	Yeroo hundumaa waan sirrii hojjechuuf yaalaa jirta.
He was very interested.	Baay'ee fedhii qaba ture.
I have to know.	Ani beekuu qaba.
He likes to tell jokes.	Qoosaa dubbachuu ni jaallata.
We stayed here longer than we should have.	Yeroo dheeraa as turuu qabnu caalaa turre.
He knew it was him.	Inni akka ta'e ni beeka ture.
Maybe it will be this day.	Tarii guyyaa kana ta'a.
You can’t have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
He didn't think much of him.	Inni baay'ee isa hin yaadne.
But this is something new.	Garuu kun waan haaraa dha.
That's just how it happened.	Akkasitti qofa ta'e.
He’s a good guy, such a good guy .	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha, gurbaa gaarii akkasii .
They are good.	Isaan gaarii dha.
was now a question.	ture amma gaaffii ture.
I think he can do it.	Ni danda'a jedheen yaada.
I couldn't believe that was true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye.
This didn’t seem to matter much.	Kun waan guddaa qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
He was definitely watching.	Inni ilaalaa akka ture beekamaadha.
Because it happens a lot.	Baay'ee waan ta'uuf.
But I'm not sure you can do it.	Garuu gochuu akka dandeessu mirkanaa'aa miti.
I know where it might be.	Eessa ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka.
Not in that car with his parents.	Warra isaa waliin konkolaataa sana keessa miti.
He is still wrong.	Ammas dogoggora qaba.
Sometimes you have to go back.	Yeroo tokko tokko duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
Nothing but money.	Maallaqa malee homaa hin jiru.
I think that’s a bad thing .	Sun waan hamaa natti fakkaata .
I didn’t see what your mouth looked like.	Afaan kee maal akka fakkaatu hin argine.
He seems to have no problem with this.	Kana irratti rakkoo waan hin qabne fakkaata.
He always lived in the moment.	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo sana keessa jiraata ture.
Then he just told me what he absolutely had to do.	Sana booda waan guutummaatti gochuu qabu qofa natti hime.
I'm not good enough.	Ani gaarii miti.
He was going to be a father.	Abbaa ta'uuf ture.
One has to be home with them most of the time.	Namni tokko yeroo baay’ee isaan waliin mana ta’uu qaba.
A month later.	Ji'a tokko booda.
There are some simple things we can do.	Wantoota salphaa hojjechuu dandeenyu tokko tokko jiru.
She said she didn't know what was going on around here anymore.	Kana booda naannoo asitti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku jette.
He knew it was so much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee akka ta'e beeka ture.
They were in today.	Har'a keessa turan.
He knows what happened.	Waan ta'e ni beeka.
I'll be right.	Ani sirrii ta'a.
Indeed, we were.	Dhuguma, nuti turre.
This is not what we have today.	Har'a kan qabnu kana miti.
To go away.	Akka deemuuf.
It doesn't seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu.
I just didn’t want to do it anymore.	Kana booda gochuu qofa hin barbaanne.
She seems to know a lot about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan baay'ee waan beektu fakkaata.
I love my parents.	Warra koo nan jaalladha.
Neither of them spoke for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf lamaan isaaniiyyuu hin dubbanne.
They’re just themselves.	Isaan ofii isaanii qofa.
Glad to see you.	Si arguu kootti gammadeera.
Look at the work.	Hojii ilaalaa.
But you can’t see it.	Garuu arguu hin dandeessu.
I mean, nothing.	Homaa jechuu kooti.
I couldn't see it now.	Amma arguu hin dandeenye.
Then she said.	Sana booda jette.
But it has happened.	Garuu ta'ee jira.
A lot, but not exactly.	Baay'ee, garuu sirriitti miti.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
I just didn’t want to.	Ani qofa hin barbaanne.
They were in the same room.	Kutaa tokko keessa turan.
We are the same.	Nuti kanuma.
What we did.	Waan hojjenne.
He wanted to believe her.	Ishee amanuu barbaade.
Sorry that's how it is.	Dhiifama akkas ta'a.
With your book.	Kitaaba keessan waliin.
I really don't know.	Dhuguma hin beeku.
But this didn’t happen.	Garuu kun hin taane.
Maybe it's because of him.	Tarii sababa isaatiin ta'uu danda'a.
It was never really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'ee hin beeku.
But it’s nothing else.	Garuu waan biraa miti.
Just a few moments, please.	Yeroo muraasa qofa maaloo.
I had no idea if that was a good thing or not.	Sun waan gaarii taʼuu fi dhiisuu isaa yaada hin qabu ture.
They already know this.	Isaan kana duruu beeku.
But you do neither.	Ati garuu lamaan isaaniiyyuu hin gootu.
They stared at each other for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ija keessa wal ilaalaa turan.
This is the place.	Bakka kana dha.
Look at this.	Kana ilaalaa.
This is not good.	Kun gaarii miti.
It was outside.	Ala ture.
It was for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ture.
It could have been my imagination.	Silaa yaada koo ta'uu danda'a ture.
He looked at the situation.	Haala jiru ilaale.
He just needs to play.	Taphachuu qofa isa barbaachisa.
It's possible.	Ni danda'ama.
That he tried again.	Akka inni ammas yaale.
I think that’s a mistake.	Sun dogoggora natti fakkaata.
There wasn’t one this day.	Guyyaa kana tokko hin turre.
Your career is only so long.	Hojiin kee hangas dheeraa qofa.
She was wrong.	Isheen dogoggora turte.
It seems like a mistake.	Dogoggora fakkaata.
It's probably bigger than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa guddaa ta'uu hin oolu.
They were evil.	Isaan hamaa turan.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
Not in that situation.	Haala sana keessa miti.
Both of those were new to us.	Sun lamaan nuuf waan haaraa turan.
That's exactly what happened.	Kan ta'e sirriitti kanuma.
He didn't.	Hin goone.
Just go home now.	Amma qofa gara manaatti deebi'i.
But someone had to do it.	Garuu namni tokko gochuu qaba ture.
It was possible.	Ni danda'ama ture.
In other words, it would still exist.	Kana jechuun ammas ni jiraata ture.
I didn't need it.	Na hin barbaachifne.
Not from any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee irraa miti.
That's how she was.	Akkas turte.
It’s not her thing.	Waan ishee miti.
Sounds very similar.	Sagalee baayyee wal fakkaata.
It was about three years ago.	Gara waggaa sadii dura ture.
Not a good time.	Yeroo gaarii miti.
It certainly wasn’t long.	Dheeraa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
But the problem is you don’t.	Garuu rakkoon jiru ati hin gootu.
They are never wrong.	Isaan gonkumaa dogoggora hin qaban.
He says very little about it.	Waa'ee isaa baay'ee xiqqoo dubbata.
I can't see you.	Si arguu hin danda'u.
I don't want to see it.	Ani arguu hin barbaadu.
He knew everything was right.	Wanti hundi sirrii akka ta’e beeka ture.
It was never supposed to be good.	Gonkumaa gaarii ta'uu hin qabu ture.
He thought he knew what she meant.	Maal jechuu ishee waan beeku itti fakkaate.
Not until now.	Hanga kana booda miti.
He had little issues.	Dhimma xiqqoo qaba ture.
I mean really good.	Dhuguma gaarii jechuu kooti.
I don't understand this.	Kana naaf hin galle.
We need to know.	Beekuu qabna.
It seemed like a good idea, so we did it.	Yaada gaarii fakkaata ture, kanaaf hojjenne.
They were working together.	Isaan waliin hojjechaa turan.
Not one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee miti.
This was going to be a long night.	Kun halkan dheeraa ta'uuf ture.
I never thought this was even possible.	Kun illee ni danda'ama jedhee hin beeku.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
It's just happening.	Ta'aa jira qofa.
A little right, but mostly wrong.	Xiqqoo sirrii, garuu irra caalaa dogoggora.
No one knows us.	Namni nu beeku hin jiru.
He seemed pretty pleased with himself.	Inni baay'ee ofitti gammade fakkaata ture.
Maybe three times.	Tarii yeroo sadii.
One day, it could be you.	Guyyaa tokko, si ta'uu dandeessa.
Who looked so happy two days ago.	Kan guyyaa lama dura akka malee gammade fakkaatu.
How did we do it?	Akkamitti goone?
But he didn't want to.	Garuu hin barbaanne.
Look at what he did.	Mee ilaalaa waan inni hojjete.
You all know who she is.	Hundi keessan eenyu akka taate ni beektu.
It’s the most important thing right now .	Yeroo ammaa kana waan hunda caalaa barbaachisaa dha .
I can't believe you're going to be out.	Ati ala ta'uuf akka jirtu amanuu hin danda'u.
I don't do anything.	Ani homaa hin godhu.
It obviously doesn’t work anymore.	Kana booda akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
he had to have.	qabaachuu qaba ture.
The reason for this is obvious.	Sababni kanaa ifaadha.
That would be really bad.	Sun dhuguma hamaa ta'a.
It was being a joke.	Qoosaa ta'aa ture.
He made them one.	Tokko isaan godhe.
I don't quite understand this.	Kana sirriitti naaf hin galle.
I can do this little thing for you.	Waan xiqqoo kana siif gochuu nan danda'a.
It made him not feel.	Miira akka hin taane isa godhe.
Current.	Yeroo ammaa.
Then he thought of something.	Sana booda waan tokko yaade.
He was a man.	Nama ture.
It's on its way, promise.	Karaa irra jira waadaa.
Almost as much as she needs them.	Hanga isheen isaan barbaachisa jechuun ni danda'ama.
You are just different from each other.	Isin wal irraa adda qofa.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
On everything.	Waan hundumaa irratti.
You can still stay in my house.	Ammallee mana koo keessa turuu dandeessu.
He was working very hard.	Baayyee hojjechaa ture.
You can't do much.	Baay'ee hin dandeessu.
One year we had a really good guy.	Waggaa tokko gurbaa dhuguma gaarii ta'e tokko qabna turre.
That's what I thought.	Akkas natti fakkaate.
I have been waiting for a very long time.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa eegaa ture.
John thinks about this.	Yohaannis dhimma kana irratti yaada.
She's a good girl, really.	Intala gaarii dha, dhuguma.
Tomorrow was going to be a day.	Boru guyyaa tokko ta'uuf ture.
Many of you may know.	Baay'een keessan ni beektu ta'a.
Except now he didn't and couldn't.	Amma hin goone fi hin dandeenye malee.
But he did not do this.	Kana garuu hin goone.
But today is not a good day.	Har'a garuu guyyaa gaarii miti.
We were all kids once.	Hundi keenya yeroo tokko ijoollee turre.
So you have another chance.	Kanaaf carraa biraa qabda.
He wanted to come.	Inni dhufuu barbaade.
I’m not so sure that’s true.	Sun dhugaa ta’uu isaa hangas mirkanaa’aa miti.
You have to do this.	Kana gochuu qabda.
He shouldn’t be looking at you.	Inni si ilaalaa jiraachuu hin qabu.
He hasn't done it yet.	Ammallee hin goone.
Some people seem to have no sense of humor.	Namoonni tokko tokko miira qoosaa waan hin qabne fakkaata.
But they are not enough.	Garuu isaan gahaa miti.
This was something new.	Kun waan haaraa ture.
Mine were tiny.	Kan koo xiqqoo xiqqoo turan.
One knows the other, she said.	Tokko kan biraa beeka jette.
See my answer here.	Deebii koo as ilaalaa.
But that's what happens.	Garuu wanti ta'u akkas ta'a.
I always had people in my house.	Yeroo hundumaa mana koo keessa namoota qaba ture.
I thought it was pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate.
Which we did.	Kan nuti hojjenne.
One house, however.	Mana tokko garuu.
He has something to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu qaba.
None demanded full answers.	Tokkollee deebii guutuu gaafate hin jiru.
Just tell me what you want.	Waan barbaaddu qofa natti himi.
But then who knows.	Garuu sana booda eenyutu beeka.
Not sure how that helps.	Sun akkamitti akka gargaaru mirkanaa'aa miti.
Now  .	Amma .
No one likes him.	Namni isa jaallatu hin jiru.
This probably matters a bit.	Kun xiqqoo dhimma qabaachuu hin oolu.
I think we need both of them.	Isaan lamaan nu barbaachisa jedheen yaada.
Her real name.	Maqaa ishee isa dhugaa.
But this didn’t happen.	Garuu kun hin taane.
It must be so great!	Akkas guddaa ta'uu qaba!
We have an opportunity with the environment.	Naannoo waliin carraa qabna.
You have one.	Tokko qabda.
Then something happened.	Sana booda wanti tokko ta'e.
I'm saying that.	Ani akkas jedha.
You know nothing about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beektu.
It would have been a girl.	Silaa intala ta'a ture.
It's doing pretty well right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jira.
I like it here.	Asitti natti tola.
She had none of it.	Isheen tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
I'm just so excited.	Ani baay'een gammade qofa.
There seems to be plenty of job opportunities.	Carraan hojii hedduu waan jiru fakkaata.
We have to do something terrible.	Waan hamaa hojjechuu qabna.
We have to have the facts.	Dhugaa jiru qabaachuu qabna.
I wasn't being anyone else.	Ani nama biraa ta'aa hin turre.
Love who you are.	Eenyu akka taate jaalladhu.
I love people like that.	Namoota akkasii nan jaalladha.
I told him exactly what happened.	Waan ta'e sirriitti itti hime.
They don't have much time.	Yeroo baayyee hin qaban.
He always thinks of ways to help people.	Yeroo hundumaa karaa itti namoota gargaaru yaada.
He didn't do it again.	Ammas hin goone.
But he asked me.	Inni garuu na gaafate.
Not a great opportunity.	Carraa guddaa miti.
We both have it.	Lamaan keenyayyuu qabna.
It was more than he could have asked for.	Inni gaafachuu danda'u caalaa ture.
That someone was right.	Namni tokko sirrii akka ture.
He lives.	Inni jiraata.
Can you tell me the truth.	Dhugaa jiru natti himuu dandeessu.
They were still my friends.	Ammas hiriyyoota koo turan.
This works without problems in my case.	Kun dhimma koo irratti rakkoo malee hojjeta.
Getting a job.	Hojii argachuu.
Friends, he thought to himself.	Hiriyyoota jedhee ofitti yaade.
You can see this place.	Bakka kana arguu dandeessu.
I didn't really want to say everything I had to say.	Waan dubbachuu qabu hunda dubbachuu baay'ee hin barbaanne.
Can you find her?	Ishee argachuu dandeessaa?
That hasn’t happened yet.	Sun ammallee hin taane.
She was drinking.	Isheen dhugaa turte.
But that was all in the past.	Garuu sun hundi kan darbe ture.
Where they ever ?.	Bakka isaan yoomiyyuu ?.
But you can see it.	Garuu arguu dandeessu.
But they were there.	Garuu achi turan.
This is not a problem at all.	Kun tasumaa rakkoo miti.
He was good at that.	Sana irratti gaarii ture.
Neither of us wanted them.	Lamaan keenyayyuu isaan hin barbaanne.
That’s what makes it unique.	Kan adda isa godhu kanuma.
Maybe she was still there.	Tarii ammallee turte ta'a.
Of people you know.	Kan namoota ati beektu.
Didn't do anything for a few weeks.	Torban muraasaaf homaa hin goone.
That was absolutely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa ture.
We worked together.	Waliin hojjenne.
This was not her business.	Kun dhimma ishee hin turre.
I can see that much.	Hamma sana arguu nan danda'a.
But you have to get the timing right.	Garuu yeroo sirriitti argachuu qabda.
But it shouldn't have been him.	Garuu isa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
That’s what he wanted to do.	Kanuma gochuu barbaade.
I know nothing of your life.	Jireenya kee homaa hin beeku.
He gave us this opportunity.	Carraa kana nuuf kenne.
But, of course, you don’t know that.	Garuu, akkas akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
But something was wrong.	Garuu wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
He might be able to find me something.	Waan tokko naaf argachuu danda'a ta'a.
They are my life.	Isaan jireenya kooti.
I saw him thinking about it.	Inni itti yaadu arge.
I thought I could play.	Taphachuu danda'a jedheen yaade.
He would have gone.	Silaa deema ture.
Not sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
Now, it’s time for me to say goodnight to all.	Amma, yeroon ani hunda halkan gaarii jedhu amma.
Our men had him.	Namoonni keenya isa qaban turan.
I still have no problems.	Ammas rakkoo hin qabu.
This night.	Halkan kana.
That’s just how things worked.	Akkasitti wanti hojjete qofa.
A long time ago .	Yeroo dheeraa dura .
But you are not.	Garuu isin miti.
But that's not what happened here.	Garuu asitti kan ta'e akkas miti.
A bad place.	Bakka hamaa.
This is what he was expecting.	Kun waan inni eegaa ture.
I knew him well enough.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka ture.
Obviously it was a problem.	Rakkoo akka ture ifaadha.
It was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
He has a wife, two children.	Haadha manaa qaba, ijoollee lama.
Later that year.	Booda bara sanaa.
You can’t forgive.	Dhiifama gochuu hin dandeessu.
I mean completely.	Guutummaatti jechuu kooti.
Me, though.	Ana garuu.
Now everyone had a job to do.	Amma namni hundi hojii hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
I don't know what to do.	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
You have to do your job.	Hojii keessan hojjechuu qabdu.
It’s my duty.	Dirqama kooti.
That's what he said.	Kana jedhe.
They were too big for me.	Isaan baay'ee naaf guddaa turan.
I don't belong there.	Ani kan achi miti.
What is he doing now? 	Amma maal irra jira?
I couldn’t believe he was about to do this, though.	Kana gochuuf jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye, garuu.
Quickly I saw it was my father.	Dafee abbaa koo ta’uu isaa arge.
This is not good.	Kun gaarii miti.
It’s just a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa.
He has it right here.	Inni sirriitti asitti qaba.
It seemed like a good idea.	Yaada gaarii fakkaata ture.
Look at him	Isa ilaalaa .
Just find me some answers please.	Deebii tokko tokko qofa naaf barbaadaa maaloo.
They are not who you are.	Isaan eenyu akka taate miti.
They want you.	Isaan si barbaadu.
Sorry to be back with you late.	Yeroo booda si waliin deebi'uu kootti dhiifama.
They just know they have it.	Akka qaban qofa beeku.
Everyone loves the simple life.	Jireenya salphaa namni hundi ni jaallata.
I'm sure of it	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha
In many cases, this no longer seems to be the case.	Yeroo baay’ee, kun kana booda waan hin taane fakkaata.
He does a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjeta.
Another long overdue.	Kan biraa yeroo dheeraa booda darbe.
Without any problems at all.	Tasumaa rakkoo tokko malee.
You can be so wrong.	Akkas dogoggora ta'uu dandeessa.
It may not even exist.	Jiraachuu illee dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I was in the best shape of my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti haala gaarii irra ture.
It was a little out on me.	Xiqqoo natti ba'e.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
I thought it was great.	Guddaa natti fakkaate.
It was probably a long time ago now.	Amma yeroo dheeraa dura ta'uu hin oolu.
Maybe a little too much.	Tarii xiqqoo garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
I definitely enjoyed the meal.	Nyaata sana baayʼee akkan itti gammade beekamaadha.
You don’t feel bad about your feelings.	Miira kee irratti miira hamaa hin qabdu.
It was clear that this was my life.	Kun jireenya koo akka ta'e ifa ture.
But he would have known them.	Garuu silaa isaan beeka ture.
But we have two things in common.	Garuu waan lama wal fakkaatu qabna.
So join us.	Kanaaf nu waliin ta'aa.
I can't do the work.	Hojii hojjechuu hin danda'u.
When will you know.	Yoom beekta.
They want answers.	Deebii barbaadu.
So they can believe it.	Kanaaf amanuu danda'u.
Or was it.	Moo ture.
He went to help him.	Isa gargaaruuf deeme.
They have children.	Ijoollee qabu.
They are more dangerous.	Isaan caalaa balaa qabu.
He got a new household name.	Maqaa mana haaraa argate.
What he wanted was always right.	Wanti inni barbaadu yeroo hundumaa sirrii ture.
Then we’re going to.	Sana booda nuti.
Who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e.
It was a long time before she spoke.	Dubbachuu ishee dura yeroo dheeraa ture.
That was what mattered.	Wanti barbaachisaa ture kanuma ture.
One person can do it.	Namni tokko ni danda'a.
But here it is better.	Garuu halkan wayya.
They couldn’t believe their eyes.	Ija isaanii amanuu hin dandeenye.
That was about me.	Sun waa'ee koo ture.
What really happened.	Dhuguma maaltu ta'e.
That is not usually the case.	Yeroo baayyee akkas miti.
I don’t want to be here.	Ani as jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
I don't know anything else.	Waan biraa hin beeku.
This is our opportunity.	Kun carraa keenya.
Please wait here.	Mee asitti eegaa.
He stared at her for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ija keessa ishee ilaale.
That had to go.	Sun deemuu qaba ture.
This was not entirely true.	Kun guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre.
But I love it.	Ani garuu nan jaalladha.
Sometimes this was very true.	Yeroo tokko tokko kun baay’ee dhugaa ture.
I will definitely do that.	Akkas gochuun koo hin oolu.
He had a few.	Muraasa qaba ture.
Everything one needs.	Waan nama barbaachisu hunda.
She wasn't sure herself.	Ofii ishee mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
This is a well-known issue.	Kun dhimma beekamaadha.
That's what she said, he said.	Kana jette inni jedhe.
What you did is wrong.	Wanti ati goote dogoggora.
This is not a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa miti.
We need to know what happened.	Waan ta'e beekuu qabna.
A lot could have happened then.	Yeroo sanatti waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a ture.
She was older.	Isheen umuriin ishee guddaa ture.
She’s just great.	Isheen guddaa qofa.
I know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
You don’t have to do this.	Kana gochuun dirqama miti.
I didn’t think anything of it.	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne.
Stay tuned for us.	Nu eegaa.
I think that would be a problem.	Sun rakkoo ta'a jedheen yaada.
More.	Caalaa.
They just need time.	Yeroo qofa barbaadu.
We have two rooms together.	Kutaa lama waliin qabna.
You are just a voice.	Ati sagalee qofa.
This is so quick.	Kun akkasitti dafee.
You can have them.	Isaan qabaachuu dandeessa.
It was too easy, this.	Garmalee salphaa ture, kun.
It wasn’t a good picture.	Suuraa gaarii hin turre.
We have to do the work.	Hojii sana hojjechuu qabna.
I have no answer at all.	Tasumaa deebii hin qabu.
He likes to talk too much.	Garmalee dubbachuu ni jaallata.
Maybe you won't.	Tarii hin gootu ta'a.
Just look at him.	Isa qofa ilaalaa.
You can never go back.	Yoomiyyuu duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
But of course it must.	Garuu beekamaadha dirqama.
Not exactly bad.	Sirriitti hamaa miti.
He never wanted to be.	Inni gonkumaa ta'uu hin barbaanne.
But then again maybe not.	Garuu sana booda ammas tarii hin ta'u.
Or is there.	Moo jira.
Of good and bad days.	Kan guyyaa gaarii fi hamaa.
But two things seem clear.	Garuu wanti lama ifa fakkaata.
But probably similar to yours.	Garuu tarii kan kee wajjin wal fakkaata.
I didn’t think it was a mistake.	Dogoggora natti hin fakkaatu ture.
But not like you.	Garuu akka kee miti.
Just a little ways.	Karaa xiqqoo qofa.
When we did that thing.	Yeroo waan sana hojjenne.
I am a human being.	Ani nama.
I am a mother.	Ani haadha.
I didn't want to.	Ani hin barbaanne.
He never went away.	Gonkumaa hin deemne.
She was very vague.	Isheen baayyee ifa hin taane turte.
Same, right, three.	Kanuma, sirrii, sadii.
That's better.	Akkasitti wayya.
But then, it had taken a while to happen.	Garuu sana booda, ta'uuf yeroo fudhate ture.
Her mother, her father.	Haadha ishee, abbaa ishee.
I thought of nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin yaadne.
He was a disaster.	Inni balaa guddaa ture.
That's just plain true.	Sun dhugaa ifa ta'e qofa.
They are in mine.	Kan koo keessa jiru.
But you don’t want them in the crowd anymore.	Garuu kana booda namoota hedduu keessa isaan hin barbaaddu.
It just doesn't matter now.	Amma qofa dhimma hin qabu.
He wanted her, he took her.	Ishee barbaade, ishee fudhate.
He didn’t want us to do it.	Akka nuti goonu hin barbaanne.
Maybe it doesn't.	Tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
It only came once.	Yeroo tokko qofa dhufe.
Everything is wrong.	Wanti hundi dogoggora.
They weren’t paired.	Isaan lama lama hin turre.
You can see them a lot.	Baay'ee isaan arguu dandeessa.
You can’t do that.	Ati akkas gochuu hin dandeessu.
I just have no idea where to go from here.	As irraa eessa akkan deemu qofa yaada hin qabu.
Not so sure of everything.	Waan hundumaa akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
He doesn’t want to come.	Inni dhufuu hin barbaadu.
I didn't do anything.	Ani homaa hin goone.
He can eat it.	Nyaachuu danda'a.
It could have been, but it didn't.	Silaa ta'uu danda'a ture, garuu hin taane.
I think this was a reaction rather than an answer.	Kun deebii osoo hin taane deebii kennuu ture jedheen yaada.
I will do it again.	Ammas nan godha.
It wasn’t his mother’s.	Kan haadha isaa hin turre.
I can't speak anymore.	Kana booda dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Not that it wasn’t good.	Gaarii hin turre jechuu miti.
I was the reason for this.	Ani kanaaf sababa ta'ee ture.
I'm still waiting.	Ammallee eegaa jira.
Somewhere in the house.	Bakka tokko mana keessa jira.
I think it does.	Ni qaba jedheen yaada.
But it came in this way.	Garuu haala kanaan dhufe.
I didn't think much of it.	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
Why, I didn't know.	Maaliif, hin beekne.
said.	jedhe.
I knew the area.	Naannoo sana nan beeka ture.
I couldn’t speak for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
Once, please.	Yeroo tokko maaloo.
This would be part of it.	Kun kutaa isaa ta'a ture.
Look at that dog!	Saree sana ilaalaa!
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
Forgiveness, not forgiveness.	Dhiifama malee dhiifama miti.
I have a lot more to say.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee jedhu qaba.
Still, that's okay.	Ammas ta'ee sun homaa miti.
It was true.	Dhugaa ture.
He was, he is.	Inni ture, jira.
Tell him how it goes.	Akkamitti akka deemu itti himi.
Didn't really do much.	Dhuguma waan baay'ee hin hojjenne.
She seems to know a lot about the girl.	Waa'ee intala sanaa waan baay'ee beektu fakkaata.
He was always there.	Yeroo hundumaa achi ture.
But you can see a lot.	Garuu baay'ee arguu dandeessa.
This would do two things.	Kun waan lama hojjeta ture.
They say your father.	Abbaa kee jedhu.
I'm not very good.	Ani baayyee gaarii miti.
He doesn't think much of his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa baay'ee hin yaadu.
She has good days and bad days.	Guyyaa gaarii fi guyyaa hamaa qabdi.
Language is our reason.	Afaan sababni keenya.
Try it for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf yaalaa.
At that point, it was still nothing.	Yeroo sanatti ammallee homaa hin turre.
It was unclear whether he was joking.	Qoosaa jiraachuu fi dhiisuu isaa ifa hin turre.
Which they didn’t.	Kan isaan hin goone.
They are everywhere.	Bakka hunda jiru.
But you are a good person.	Garuu ati nama gaarii dha.
It's just something else.	Waan biraa qofa.
To be with Him.	Isa waliin ta'uuf.
She hadn’t meant to do that.	Isheen akkas gochuuf hin yaadne turte.
I told him it would happen.	Ni ta'a jedheen itti hime.
He found himself doing more.	Caalaatti hojjechaa of argate.
We need a new one.	Haaraa nu barbaachisa.
I was pretty good at it.	Ani baayyee gaarii ture.
There must be something.	Waan tokko jiraachuu qaba.
I have been watching them.	Isaan ilaalaa tureera.
I mean the other way around.	Karaa biraa jechuu kooti.
What he says cannot be true.	Wanti inni jedhu dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I wonder if this will be me soon.	Kun yeroo dhiyootti ana ta'aa jedheen yaada.
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
That you don’t want to, obviously.	Akka hin barbaaddu, ifaadha.
But not around twice.	Garuu yeroo lama naannoo miti.
That is very wrong.	Sun baayyee dogoggora.
That's about it.	Waa'ee isaa kanuma.
He is here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana as jira.
It still may not be enough.	Ammas gahaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Perhaps even more important.	Tarii kana caalaa barbaachisaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
Repeat several times.	Yeroo hedduu irra deebi’i.
But I don't know.	Ani garuu hin beeku.
This is very obvious.	Kun baayyee ifaadha.
It's about me, not her.	Waa'ee kooti malee waa'ee ishee miti.
I have nothing to do.	Ani waanan godhu hin qabu.
It was very clear.	Baayyee ifa ture.
It was more how she said it.	Caalaatti akkamitti akka jette ture.
I don’t want to do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuu hin barbaadu.
None of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
I don’t know how to do that.	Akkamitti akkan akkas godhu hin beeku.
He does his job.	Hojii isaa hojjeta.
Neither had children.	Lamaan isaanii ijoollee hin qaban turan.
Really, really almost.	Dhuguma, dhuguma jechuun ni danda'ama.
We didn’t have it.	Hin qabnu turre.
She didn’t like the dog.	Saree sana hin jaallattu turte.
He hadn’t thought about it.	Inni itti hin yaadne ture.
I don’t say it.	Hin jedhu.
Most of the time, that's what we have to do in this life.	Yeroo baayyee, jireenya kana keessatti waan gochuu qabnu kanuma.
Something not like them.	Waan akka isaanii hin taane.
Someone did this for me a long time ago.	Namni tokko yeroo dheeraa dura kana naaf godhe.
From his room.	Kutaa isaa irraa.
No one ever seems to do that.	Gonkumaa namni akkas godhu hin fakkaatu.
It seemed like a good idea.	Yaada gaarii fakkaata ture.
I told him all that.	Sana hunda itti hime.
I couldn’t meet them.	Isaan waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye.
I want to get to know you better.	Caalaatti si beekuu barbaada.
That's the hour of my life.	Sun sa'aatii jireenya kooti.
I’m not really interested.	Ani dhuguma fedhii hin qabu.
I want to make that clear.	Sana ifa gochuu barbaada.
The most important thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
But they do.	Garuu ni godhu.
He was very different.	Inni baayyee adda ture.
I have no answer at that time.	Yeroo sanatti deebii hin qabu.
We have to come to it.	Itti dhufuu qabna.
If only one thing.	Yoo waan tokko qofa.
I hardly got to know you.	Ani baay'ee si beekuu hin dandeenye.
They are so good together.	Waliin akka malee gaarii dha.
How long ago it was.	Yeroo meeqa dura ture.
He had one.	Tokko qaba ture.
Perhaps he did.	Tarii ni godhe taʼa.
They are constantly looking into them.	Yeroo hundumaa isaan keessa ilaalaa jiru.
I can't stay that long anymore.	Kana booda hanga sana turuu hin danda'u.
I really want to see someone new.	Nama haaraa arguu baay'een barbaada.
Now it was nothing.	Amma homaa hin turre.
We wouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas hin goonu turre.
He knows it.	Inni ni beeka.
This is a very important task.	Kun hojii baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
He couldn’t have it.	Inni qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
You’re in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirta.
I don’t tell them what they don’t know.	Waan isaan hin beekne itti hin himu.
This was happening.	Kun ta'aa ture.
The other one had one.	Inni biraa tokko qaba ture.
She had no idea what to make of it.	Maal irraa akka gootu yaada hin qabdu turte.
He was in his house.	Mana isaa keessa ture.
What is that?	Sun maali?
But there was no time.	Garuu yeroon hin turre.
But he wanted to know.	Garuu beekuu barbaade.
There would be people there.	Silaa namoonni achi jiru.
After a couple of days.	Guyyaa lama lama booda.
But that would be completely wrong.	Garuu sun guutummaatti dogoggora ta’a.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
You can come back to it later.	Booda itti deebi'uu dandeessu.
We have two children so far.	Hanga ammaatti ijoollee lama qabna.
They had no food.	Nyaata hin qaban turan.
It can go too far.	Garmalee deemuu danda'a.
Only if it works.	Yoo hojjete qofa.
We weren’t there.	Nuti achi hin turre.
In your own home.	Mana keessan keessatti.
That seems wrong, right?	Sun dogoggora fakkaata mitiiree?
They couldn’t believe their eyes.	Ija isaanii amanuu hin dandeenye.
We have a lot of money.	Maallaqa hedduu qabna.
You may be on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra jiraachuu dandeessa.
How is it in there.	Akkamitti achi keessa jira.
I couldn't have done without it.	Silaa malee gochuu hin danda'u ture.
Having a very easy job.	Hojii baay'ee salphaa qabaachuu.
That was his thing.	Sun waan isaa ture.
Bad and good.	Hamaa fi gaarii.
You can’t meet their needs.	Fedhii isaanii guutuu hin dandeessu.
He was the only person in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa nama qofa ture.
This is not a new problem.	Kun rakkoo haaraa miti.
Like, me, today.	Akka, ana, har'a.
There were people.	Namoonni turan.
Something was going to go wrong, he just knew it.	Waan tokko dogoggora ta'uuf ture, inni qofa beeka ture.
I didn’t need to say that.	Akkas jechuun na hin barbaachifne.
She must be.	Ta'uu qabdi.
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
Didn't do as good a job on her.	Hojii akka gaarii ishee irratti hin hojjenne.
This isn’t necessarily a bad thing.	Kun dirqama waan hamaa ta’uu hin qabu.
We were becoming one rather than two.	Lama caalaa tokko ta'aa turre.
I don’t want to see what’s there.	Waan achi jiru arguu hin barbaadu.
We are going to help!.	Gargaaruuf jirra!.
I can't believe it otherwise.	Kana malee amanuu hin danda'u.
She doesn't think about anything else.	Waan biraa hin yaaddu.
None of them are wrong.	Tokkollee dogoggora hin qabu.
We are almost here.	Asitti jirra jechuun ni danda'ama.
Inside the house.	Mana keessaa.
He once loved this house.	Yeroo tokko mana kana ni jaallata ture.
That’s not the case there.	Achitti akkas miti.
I can't find any.	Tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u.
What works for you today, may not work tomorrow.	Wanti har'a siif hojjetu, boru hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
You love it.	Isin jaallattu.
They’re just a must.	Isaan dirqama qofa.
I don't know maybe it's just something she can do.	Hin beeku tarii waan isheen hojjechuu dandeessu qofa ta'uu danda'a.
He was her car.	Inni konkolaataa ishee ture.
She will never do anything to you again.	Kana booda gonkumaa homaa si hin gootu.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
Everyone.	Nama hundumaa.
I don't like him.	Ani isa hin jaalladhu.
It was just their luck.	Carraa isaanii qofa ture.
I’ve only been working with her for two weeks.	Torban lama qofa ishee waliin hojjechaa ture.
It’s a guy.	Gurbaa dha.
He's holding you.	Si qabaa jira.
I couldn’t see them.	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
It could have been something if she had been different.	Osoo isheen adda taate waan ta'uu danda'a ture.
Oh? 	Maaloo?
He wants you.	Si barbaada.
But they could be more than that.	Garuu isaan kana caalaa ta'uu danda'u.
They shouldn’t know.	Beekuu hin qaban.
I didn't understand.	Ani hin hubanne ture.
I wasn't sure why he was coming.	Maaliif akka dhufu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
They had no one else.	Nama biraa hin qaban turan.
You don't know anything.	Ati homaa hin beektu.
So, she had no idea what to do with her life.	Kanaaf, jireenya ishee maal akka gootu yaada hin qabdu turte.
That’s just the truth.	Sun dhugaa qofa.
Which you have to believe.	Kan ati amanuu qabdu.
She did everything she could.	Waan dandeessu hunda goote.
New and old.	Haaraa fi durii.
He looked up at her.	Ol jedhee ilaale.
You don’t even want to.	Illee hin barbaaddu.
How do you do this?	Kana akkamitti gootu?
I just wasn’t really myself.	Ani qofa dhuguma ofii koo hin turre.
Some weeks.	Torban tokko tokko.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
I'm not you.	Ani si miti.
There was no one inside.	Namni keessa hin turre.
I had no idea how he knew that.	Akkamitti akka inni kana beeku yaada hin qabu ture.
Nothing really happened.	Dhuguma wanti ta'e hin jiru.
This doesn't seem right.	Kun sirrii hin fakkaatu.
They are certainly not perfect.	Isaan guutuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But we still had hope.	Garuu ammas abdii qabna turre.
I can't even see what it is.	Maal akka ta'e illee arguu hin danda'u.
That was the only time.	Yeroon sun qofa ture.
Nothing is going on.	Wanti deemaa jiru hin jiru.
He should know.	Beekuu qaba.
They're looking at you.	Si ilaalaa jiru.
I will never do this again.	Kana booda gonkumaa kana hin godhu.
That would have been nice.	Silaa sun gaarii ture.
But I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e garuu hin beeku.
Look at this.	Kana ilaalaa.
I knew all but one of the answers.	Deebii tokko malee hunda nan beeka ture.
He was in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa ture.
The only thing they really had in common was food.	Dhuguma wanti isaan wal fakkaatu nyaata qofa ture.
Then he went out.	Sana booda ba'e.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
But now he was sure.	Amma garuu mirkanaa'aa ta'e.
And that’s not all.	Kana qofa miti.
I don't have anything.	Ani homaa hin qabu.
It doesn't do anything.	Homaa hin hojjetu.
Asking someone to come.	Nama akka dhufu gaafachuu.
But it’s not that simple.	Garuu hangas salphaa miti.
This doesn't work.	Kun hin hojjetu.
Maybe another time.	Tarii yeroo biraa.
But not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf garuu miti.
It took a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
No one did it.	Namni godhe hin jiru.
But it was not lifeless.	Jireenya kan hin qabne garuu hin turre.
It matters what the reason is.	Sababni isaa maal akka ta'e dhimma qaba.
All he wanted the whole time was to get back to you.	Yeroo sana guutuu wanti inni barbaade sitti deebi'uu qofa ture.
It is not necessary now.	Amma hin barbaachisu.
We can’t do it without them.	Isaan malee gochuu hin dandeenyu.
She was great, he says.	Isheen guddaa turte jedha.
I’m with you on that.	Sana irratti si waliin jira.
But that’s what it looked like before.	Garuu kanaan dura akkas fakkaata ture.
She has.	Isheen qabdi.
This becomes a reality.	Kun waan dhugaa ta'a.
People were walking away.	Namoonni deemaa turan.
None next week.	Torban dhufu hin jiru.
I really wanted this to work.	Kun akka hojjetu baay'een barbaade.
He is the innermost.	Inni kan keessaa.
How did he do it?	Akkamitti godhe?
I know all this.	Kana hunda nan beeka.
Why does he do it.	Maaliif godha.
It's still like that.	Ammallee akkasitti jira.
This one is a human being.	Inni kun nama.
But it still wasn’t enough.	Garuu ammas gahaa hin turre.
I don't want to see anything.	Ani homaa arguu hin barbaadu.
She was absolutely adorable.	Isheen guutummaatti namatti tola turte.
You can't come.	Dhufuu hin dandeessu.
I'm very happy with it.	Ani baayyee itti gammadeera.
And yet now nothing happened.	Ammas amma homaa hin taane.
I think we should do this together.	Kana waliin gochuu qabna jedheen yaada.
No one knows but me.	Ana malee namni beeku hin jiru.
That was the worst of it.	Sun keessaa isa hamaa ture.
That’s of course.	Sun beekamaadha.
I don’t need them anymore.	Kana booda isaan hin barbaachisu.
You don't want me.	Ati na hin barbaaddu.
What can you see there? 	Achitti maal arguu dandeessa?
Too much, too long.	Garmalee, baayyee dheeraa dha.
Much better than he would have thought.	Silaa inni yaadu caalaa baayyee gaarii dha.
Most people would.	Namoonni baay'een silaa.
I don't know when it happened.	Yoom akka ta'e hin beeku.
Once they could be eyes.	Yeroo tokko ija ta'uu danda'u.
Didn't know how to do it all the time.	Yeroo hunda hojjechuu hin beekne.
But nothing is happening now.	Garuu waan amma ta'aa jiru hin jiru.
It couldn't have been good.	Gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
But no one took me all that long.	Garuu namni hanga sana hunda natti fudhate hin jiru.
It’s not a good thing.	Waan gaarii miti.
Maybe it's not necessary.	Tarii hin barbaachisu ta'a.
They don’t care.	Isaan dhimma hin qaban.
It rarely happens like that.	Yeroo muraasaaf akkas ta'a.
Not much, perhaps.	Baay'ee miti tarii.
As they were.	Akkuma turan.
But this wasn’t a school.	Garuu kun mana barumsaa hin turre.
I couldn't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
Had a few issues in the past.	Yeroo darbe dhimma muraasa qaba ture.
It may or may not be so.	Akkas ta’uu danda’a, ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
They don’t have a room.	Kutaa hin qaban.
He was a man of action.	Nama gochaa ture.
Maybe it was then.	Tarii yeroo sana ta'uu danda'a.
Not on anything different.	Waan adda ta'e irratti miti.
That’s not me.	Sun ana miti.
Everything was fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ture.
It’s in the matter.	Dhimma keessa jira.
Maybe that's what happened here.	Tarii asitti kan ta'e kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
Time was good for him.	Yeroon nama isaaf gaarii ture.
I don't mean that.	Kana jechuun koo miti.
You can't say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin dandeessu.
All they really need is a guy.	Wanti isaan barbaachisu dhuguma gurbaa qofa.
I am one of them.	Ani isaan keessaa tokko.
I said sure enough.	Anis mirkanaa'aa jedheen.
You can call them yours.	Isaan kan kee jechuu dandeessa.
Still nothing.	Ammas homaa hin jiru.
Which, of course, happened.	Kan, beekamaadha, ta’e.
Many, many things.	Waan hedduu hedduu.
Just one of many.	Baay'ee keessaa tokko qofa.
He should have known she thought that.	Silaa akkas akka yaaddu beekuu qaba ture.
It was someone else entirely.	Guutummaatti nama biraa ture.
We don’t need it anymore.	Kana booda nu hin barbaachisu.
So many things could have gone wrong.	Kanaaf wanti baay'een dogoggora ta'uu danda'a ture.
No one asked questions.	Namni gaaffii gaafate hin jiru.
That night was different.	Halkan sana adda ture.
I think it will be interest.	Fedhii ta'a jedheen yaada.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Tarii sun gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
I mean, it was my father.	Abbaa koo ture jechuu kooti.
We need say no more.	Kana caalaa jechuu hin qabnu.
Probably his favorite thing, ever.	Tarii waan inni jaallatu ta'uu danda'a, yoomiyyuu.
So, there is hope.	Kanaaf, abdiin jira.
So a whole lifetime.	Kanaaf jireenya guutuu.
I don't know why this is happening.	Kun maaliif akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
It’s my opinion.	Yaada kooti.
He seemed to know their intentions.	Inni yaada isaanii waan beeku fakkaata ture.
I want to be just like her.	Anis akkuma ishee ta'uu barbaada.
That's very important, you know.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa dha, beekta.
But he did nothing.	Garuu wanti godhe hin jiru.
He had a problem.	Rakkoo qaba ture.
I think people should buy their own books.	Namoonni kitaaba ofii bitachuu qabu jedheen yaada.
We were trying a couple of things.	Waan tokko lama yaalaa turre.
You were there the other way.	Ati karaa biraa achi turte.
There was that opportunity.	Carraan sun ni ture.
I don’t know them.	Isaan hin beeku.
He was still looking at me.	Ammallee na ilaalaa ture.
I'm just trying to be of help.	Gargaarsa ta'uuf qofa yaalaa jira.
She was mostly funny.	Irra caalaa qoosaa turte.
They watched for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf ilaalaa turan.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
This would be a problem.	Kun rakkoo ta'a.
I wish it wasn’t.	Osoo hin taane natti tola.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
Check out this picture here.	Suuraa kana as ilaalaa.
You know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'u beekta.
As you know, it will be easy.	Akkuma beektu salphaa ta'a.
He said he did not know why he did it.	Maaliif akka godhe hin beeku jedheera.
Try some of them out.	Isaan keessaa muraasa isaanii yaalaa.
Yet the problem still exists.	Ammas rakkoon jiru ammallee jira.
It was right.	Sirrii ture.
It happens, you know.	Ni ta'a, beekta.
You can almost see it.	Arguu dandeessu jechuun ni danda'ama.
I definitely think about it all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee kanaa akkan yaadu beekamaadha.
I knew where it was going.	Eessa akka deemu nan beeka ture.
Everyone he worked with.	Nama inni waliin hojjete hunda.
These are very different.	Isaan kun baayyee adda.
But he can't.	Garuu hin danda'u.
I don’t know what to do with her now.	Amma maal akkan ishee godhu hin beeku.
With another teacher.	Barsiisaa biraa waliin.
You have to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabda.
But look he did.	Garuu ilaalaa inni godhe.
That is, they love it.	Kana jechuun ni jaallatu.
So nothing came of it.	Kanaaf wanti irraa dhufe hin jiru.
You should know better than that.	Kana caalaa beekuu qabda.
I'm sitting here.	Ani as taa'a.
He’s just a guy.	Inni gurbaa qofa.
He spoke for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf dubbate.
No one else should ever know.	Namni biraa yoomiyyuu beekuu hin qabu.
I had no idea what had happened.	Waan ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii.
Exactly to me.	Sirriitti natti.
Nobody wants money like that.	Namni akkasitti maallaqa hin barbaadu.
You are not like me.	Ati akka koo miti.
A lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee.
I didn’t want to live without him.	Isa malee jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
I can't leave her like that.	Akkasitti ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
It doesn't mean much more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee jechuu miti.
Sometimes that might have been the case.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
But this was something very different.	Garuu kun waan baayyee adda ta'e ture.
So it was everything.	Kanaaf waan hundumaa ture.
That's pretty much what happened.	Waan ta'e baay'ee kanuma.
I love her voice.	Sagalee ishee baay'een jaalladha.
You will love it.	Ni jaallattu.
Looks like it might be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu danda'a fakkaata.
No one found her.	Namni ishee argate hin jiru.
Almost everyone.	Nama hunda jechuun ni danda'ama.
I said I'm sorry.	Dhiifama jedheen.
The bad and the good.	Kan hamaa fi gaarii.
I am still in trouble like my father.	Ammas akkuma abbaa kootti rakkoo keessa jira.
He was still here.	Ammas as ture.
No one else went there.	Namni biraa achi hin deemne.
This is the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kana.
Those are good things.	Isaan sun wantoota gaarii dha.
From time to time.	Yeroo yeroo.
Maybe they can help.	Tarii gargaaruu danda'u ta'a.
You need to make that path more clear.	Karaa sana caalaatti ifa gochuu qabda.
He was in a bad way.	Karaa hamaa keessa ture.
They’re looking at me.	Isaan na ilaalaa jiru.
He looked up at the house.	Ol jedhee mana sana ilaale.
There can be no other.	Kan biraa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
I don't have a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee hin qabu.
She had no idea how to know this.	Kana akkamitti akka beektu yaada hin qabdu turte.
I'm sorry for the little man.	Nama xiqqoo dhiifama.
It wasn’t here.	Halkan hin turre.
That’s not a mistake.	Sun dogoggora miti.
Not very much.	Baayyee baay'ee miti.
Why does this happen?	Kun maaliif ta'a.
You can't ask for much better than that.	Kana caalaa baayyee gaarii gaafachuu hin dandeessu.
But your reasons were good.	Garuu sababni keessan gaarii ture.
Even this one could be above that.	Inni kun illee sana ol ta'uu danda'a.
Is there anyone who can help me?	Namni na gargaaru jiraa?
I was only in there three hours or so.	Sa'aatii sadii fi sanaa ol qofa achi keessa ture.
Everyone was different, of course.	Namni hundi adda akka ture beekamaadha.
I think you’ll love it.	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada.
Not too bad, really.	Baay'ee hamaa miti, dhuguma.
Good day.	Guyyaa gaarii.
How it didn’t happen.	Akkamitti hin taane.
Soon it wouldn't have been enough.	Yeroo dhiyootti silaa gahaa hin ta'u ture.
To be with Him.	Isa waliin ta'uuf.
Not this one!.	Isa kana miti!.
It was a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii ture.
Now the problem is.	Amma rakkoon.
I had said that, too.	Anis akkas jedheen ture.
That would be right.	Sun sirrii ta'a.
He must have one.	Tokko qabaachuu qaba.
Then it worked.	Sana booda hojjete.
You are my problem.	Ati rakkoo kooti.
I went to work on it yesterday.	Kaleessa irratti hojjechuuf deeme.
But they were watching.	Garuu ilaalaa turan.
Now onto the good stuff.	Amma waan gaarii irratti.
Everyone wants to help him.	Namni hundi isa gargaaruu barbaada.
I don’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
It must be someone else.	Nama biraa ta'uu qaba.
It's going to be a long night.	Halkan dheeraa ta'uuf jira.
I couldn’t see anything from here.	As irraa homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
So he could be with her.	Kanaaf ishee wajjin taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
I'm looking for him.	Ani isa barbaada.
No one seems to understand!.	Namni waan hubate hin fakkaatu!.
I will say it again.	Ammas nan jedha.
That means you have to know your place at all times.	Kana jechuun yeroo hunda bakka kee beekuu qabda.
I'm so sorry about that.	Kanaaf baayyee dhiifama.
But it worked for me.	Garuu naaf hojjete.
Went.	Deeme.
It's a very accurate thing.	Waan baayyee sirrii dha.
Now they have it.	Amma qaban.
But I can't have this.	Garuu kana qabaachuu hin danda'u.
It’s not that big of a deal.	Waan guddaa akkasii miti.
That would be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'a.
You can’t buy this life.	Jireenya kana bitachuu hin dandeessu.
I probably never will.	Ani tarii gonkumaa hin godhu.
There was plenty of time to be together.	Yeroon waliin ta'uuf baay'ee ture.
He asked her why.	Maaliif jedhee ishee gaafate.
That's the other thing.	Inni biraa kanuma.
I’m not exactly sure how you do it.	Akkamitti akka gootu sirriitti hin beeku.
Not sure about you.	Waa'ee kee mirkanaa'aa miti.
He did what he did.	Waan hojjete hojjete.
You have yourself.	Of qabda.
It is no longer one's own.	Kana booda kan ofii miti.
I don't want that to be me.	Sun akka ana ta'u hin barbaadu.
It wasn’t a question.	Gaaffii hin turre.
No one has it.	Namni tokkollee hin qabu.
You two are my friends.	Isin lamaan hiriyyoota kooti.
I know this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka.
He had a lot of it.	Baay'ee qaba ture.
But this was one of them.	Garuu kun isaan keessaa tokko ture.
It wasn't as bad as the danger she was in for.	Akka balaa isheen keessa jirtu hamaa hin turre.
It wasn't needed here.	Asitti hin barbaachisu ture.
I want you more.	Caalaatti si barbaada.
He noticed a sound outside her door.	Sagalee balbala ishee ala jiru hubate.
A few years.	Waggaa muraasa.
Not really themselves.	Dhuguma ofii isaanii miti.
Maybe, he thought, as she said.	Tarii akkuma isheen jette ta'uu danda'a jedhee yaade.
You you know.	Ati ati beekta.
I mean, it was a joke.	Qoosaa ture jechuu kooti.
Please go without me.	Mee na malee deemaa.
He was someone else.	Inni nama biraa ture.
Everyone in the bar was looking at him. 	Namoonni mana dhugaatii sana keessa turan hundi isa ilaalaa turan. 
But it gave way on the long run.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa irratti karaa kenne.
When she is on her way.	Yeroon karaa ishee irra jirtu.
I knew he did a couple of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokko lama akka godhe nan beeka ture.
He could have done this.	Silaa kana gochuu danda'a ture.
You know who we are, now.	Eenyu akka taane beekta, amma.
I'm here to stay.	Ani as jira.
I still don't fully understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ammallee guutummaatti naaf hin galle.
Sometimes it goes like this.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkasitti deema.
He eats snacks and lots and lots of food.	Nyaata salphaa fi nyaata baay'ee fi baay'ee nyaata.
It will happen soon enough.	Yeroo dhiyootti ni ta'a.
Maybe he was right.	Tarii inni dhugaa ture ta'a.
Asking him for it.	Isa gaafachuu.
A great way to help people.	Karaa guddaa namoota gargaaruuf gargaaru.
It becomes a lot of issues really quickly.	Dhuguma dafee dhimma baay'ee ta'a.
They don’t have to tell you what to do.	Waan gootu sitti himuu hin qaban.
He must be his true self.	Inni ofii isaa isa dhugaa ta’uu qaba.
And that’s not all.	Kana qofa miti.
It wouldn't have happened in the morning.	Silaa ganama hin ta'u ture.
I couldn't tell you something like that.	Waan akkasii sitti himuu hin danda'u ture.
My father twice.	Abbaa koo yeroo lama.
It eats together.	Itti waliin nyaata.
One other suggestion.	Yaada biraa tokko.
Work is not required.	Hojiin hin barbaachisu.
In your case, the right one.	Haala keessan keessatti, kan sirrii ta'e.
When you have that, you have so much.	Yeroo sana qabdu waan baay'ee qabda.
Not that it matters.	Dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
They are nothing.	Isaan homaa miti.
But maybe they have.	Garuu tarii qaban ta'a.
We had one.	Tokko qabna turre.
Things that matter.	Wantoota dhimma qaban.
I'm not good at that sort of thing.	Ani waan akkasii irratti ga'umsa hin qabu.
These were good people.	Isaan kun namoota gaarii turan.
But of course not.	Garuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
About a lot of things.	Waa'ee waan baay'ee.
We are well on our way to that.	Sana karaa gaarii irra jirra.
Of course, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I wanted to say more.	Kana caalaa dubbachuu barbaade.
If they are older, then.	Yoo umuriin isaanii guddaa ta'e, sana booda.
Not just not bad.	Hamaa hin taane qofa miti.
So  .	Kanaaf .
For some time here.	Yeroo muraasaaf asitti.
But now there is a problem.	Amma garuu rakkoon jira.
A little time passed.	Yeroon xiqqoo darbe.
You should never come back here.	Yoomiyyuu asitti deebi'uu hin qabdu.
But it shouldn't be like that.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
Look at your people.	Namoota keessan ilaalaa.
It was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ture.
That was what was in her.	Kan ishee keessa ture kanuma ture.
I want to have a job.	Hojii qabaachuu barbaada.
But we were.	Garuu turre.
Maybe it's just the best.	Tarii isa gaarii qofa ta'a.
I can see it there.	Achitti arguu nan danda'a.
It matters.	Dhimma qaba.
Time does that.	Yeroon akkas godha.
There is no work.	Hojiin hin jiru.
I don't want to see any other comments today.	Har'a yaada biraa arguu hin barbaadu.
We would have had more of that.	Silaa sana keessaa baay'ee qabna turre.
It looks like us, said one.	Nu fakkaata jedhe tokko.
But this time, he would have to.	Yeroo kana garuu, dirqama ta'a ture.
They do the job well.	Hojii sana akka gaariitti hojjetu.
He seemed nice enough.	Inni nama gaarii gahaa fakkaata ture.
I’m going to do this thing.	Ani waan kana hojjechuuf deema.
Nothing else has anything like that.	Wanti biraa sanaa wajjin waan wal fakkaatu hin qabu.
We shouldn’t have told him.	Silaa itti himuu hin qabnu ture.
If this.	Yoo kun.
I just can't anymore.	Kana booda qofa hin danda'u.
He wanted to know if she wanted to be his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa ta'uu akka barbaaddu beekuu barbaade.
I don't have to.	Ani dirqama miti.
This is very important.	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
There wasn't much else.	Waan biraa baay'een hin turre.
But it shouldn’t exist.	Garuu jiraachuu hin qabu.
What she needed was sleep.	Wanti ishee barbaachisu hirriba ture.
Everything was fine.	Hundi gaarii ture.
Then he tried again.	Sana booda ammas yaale.
You all have to go.	Hundi keessan deemuu qabdu.
That doesn't matter.	Sun homaa hin qabu.
He hadn’t seen it coming.	Inni dhufuu isaa hin argine ture.
I want it so bad.	Ani akkasitti hamaa barbaada.
If we are here, we are here.	Yoo as jirra ta'e as jirra.
It doesn’t mean me.	Ana jechuu miti.
But they make us who we are.	Garuu eenyu akka taane nu godhu.
Says one of us.	Jedha tokko keenya.
But you don't want to tell me anything more.	Garuu kana caalaa waan tokko natti himuu hin barbaaddu.
This is right on the money.	Kun qarshii irratti sirrii dha.
I don’t know the answer.	Deebii isaa hin beeku.
But no one knows.	Garuu namni beeku hin jiru.
He must eat food.	Nyaata nyaachuu qaba.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Tarii guyyaa tokko ta'a, garuu ammallee miti.
This was now becoming a serious problem.	Kun amma rakkoo hamaa ta'aa ture.
He loved it so much.	Inni baay'ee jaallata ture.
Got to do a few.	Muraasa hojjechuuf argate.
He never had a chance.	Carraa argate hin beeku.
It’s not just playing in the background.	Duubatti taphachuu qofa miti.
You know you want it.	Akka barbaaddu ni beekta.
Not enough time.	Yeroo gahaa miti.
I can't ask.	Gaafachuu hin danda'u.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
He had a name.	Maqaa qaba ture.
Not sure what is going wrong.	Waan dogoggora ta'aa jiru mirkanaa'aa miti.
You would never do that to someone you love.	Nama jaallattu irratti gonkumaa akkas hin gootu turte.
Like you said, today is my lucky day.	Akkuma ati jette har'a guyyaa carraa kooti.
. . . .	.
It doesn’t go away for long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin deemu.
I’m not going to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf hin deemu.
But now he is not there.	Amma garuu achi hin jiru.
I don’t know what to do from here.	As irraa maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
It’s not our problem.	Rakkoo keenya miti.
Now that was not the time.	Amma yeroon sun hin turre.
I don't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
But that wasn’t the worst.	Garuu sun hunda caalaa hamaa hin turre.
She was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola turte.
He was too lonely.	Garmalee kophaa isaa ture.
This is just one thing.	Kun waan tokko qofa.
It was all so real.	Hundi isaa akkas dhugaa ture.
None of them are mine.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee kan koo miti.
And now we both have a lot.	Ammas lamaan keenyayyuu waan baay'ee qabna.
He has to play.	Taphachuu qaba.
I'm not here.	Ani as hin jiru.
Tell me a joke.	Qoosaa tokko natti himi.
It was a great job.	Hojii guddaa ture.
Please help.	Mee gargaaru.
But they know the feeling when it comes.	Miira yeroo dhufu garuu ni beeku.
No one knows.	Namni beeku hin jiru.
I couldn't have been more curious.	Kana caalaa fedhii beekuu hin danda'u ture.
I really didn’t know what to say.	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture.
Not sure what happened.	Waan ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
I don't know much about that time.	Waa'ee yeroo sanaa waan baay'ee hin beeku.
He could have, but he couldn't.	Silaa danda'a ture, garuu hin dandeenye.
They had one daughter.	Intala tokko qaban turan.
That wasn’t us.	Sun nu hin turre.
After an extreme day.	Guyyaa garmalee booda.
We shouldn't be like that.	Nuti akkas ta'uu hin qabnu.
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
Maybe he's a.	Tarii inni nama...
What happened in that situation happened.	Wanti haala sana keessatti ta'e ta'e.
It wasn’t there before.	Duraan hin turre.
I couldn’t stay with her.	Ishee bira turuu hin dandeenye.
He was at work all day.	Guyyaa guutuu hojii irra ture.
The light is bright.	Ifa ifaadha.
This person.	Namni kun.
That was enough.	Sana gahaa ture.
It's not about me.	Waa'ee koo miti.
He’s not for you.	Inni siif miti.
I am like .	Ani akka .
I thought it was true at the time.	Yeroo sanatti dhugaa natti fakkaate.
He has two parents.	Warra lama qaba.
A week is just a week.	Torban tokko torban tokko qofa.
Not a good idea though.	Yaada gaarii miti garuu.
This was a terrible mistake.	Kun dogoggora hamaa ture.
I've never been like that.	Ani akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
I had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I didn't think it was.	Akkas ta'e natti hin fakkaatu ture.
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
Once he saw someone who looked like her.	Yeroo tokko nama ishee fakkaatu tokko arge.
She has three children.	Ijoollee sadii qabdi.
I was in no position to do anything else.	Waan biraa hojjechuuf haala hin turre.
We are all together.	Hundi keenya waliin.
You know what you have there.	Waan achitti qabdu ni beekta.
So far, there is no reason to do so.	Hanga ammaatti sababni akkas gochuuf hin jiru.
I knew the name.	Maqaa sana nan beeka ture.
I wasn’t here before.	Duraan as hin turre.
It still works.	Ammas ni hojjeta.
It will be good tonight.	Halkan kana gaarii ta'a.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Dirqama akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
That wasn’t her.	Sun ishee hin turre.
In your case, hours.	Haala keessan keessatti, sa'aatii.
I just would never have thought of it.	Silaa gonkumaa hin yaadu ture qofa.
Sorry about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dhiifama.
He can answer me.	Inni deebii naaf kennuu danda'a.
Which you can do.	Kan ati gochuu dandeessu.
No one wanted this thing.	Wanti kana namni barbaade hin jiru.
I looked all over the room, but saw nothing.	Kutaa sana hunda ilaale, garuu homaa hin argine.
I have to go now.	Amma deemuun qaba.
Everyone knew the place.	Namni hundi bakka sana ni beeka ture.
I could work out.	Hojii hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture.
They were waiting for him.	Isa eegaa turan.
He was like the father she would have loved to have.	Inni akka abbaa silaa isheen qabaachuu jaallattu ture.
He could tell her this.	Kana itti himuu danda'a ture.
But it’s not his time, it’s not his time.	Garuu yeroo isaa miti, yeroo isaa miti.
That was good, he thought.	Sun gaarii ture jedhee yaade.
I really don't know why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
This may be something new.	Kun waan haaraa ta'uu danda'a.
Very nice in your hands.	Harka keessan keessaa baayyee namatti tola.
You have to earn money.	Maallaqa argachuu qabda.
I like the food.	Nyaata natti tola.
He's here tonight.	Halkan kana as jira.
I don't say that.	Akkas hin jedhu.
I don't have that.	Ani akkas hin qabu.
If doing that works for you, that’s absolutely fine.	Yoo sana gochuun siif hojjete, sun guutummaatti gaarii dha.
Seeing you and not being with you.	Si arguu fi si waliin ta'uu dhiisuu.
What's going on? 	Maaltu ta'aa jira?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I think this is true.	Kun dhugaa natti fakkaata.
We need to have that.	Sana qabaachuu qabna.
We seem to have the same idea.	Yaada tokko qabna fakkaata.
He understood the passage.	Kutaa sana hubate.
We wanted to do something about that.	Sana irratti waan tokko gochuu barbaanne.
No one knows.	Namni beeku hin jiru.
It was just sleep.	Hirriba qofa ture.
The only other thing is her job.	Wanti biraa hojii ishee qofa.
It certainly was nothing of the sort.	Waan akkasii akka hin turre beekamaadha.
But there she was, that’s it.	Garuu achi turte, kanuma.
He knew better now.	Amma caalaatti beeka ture.
I have plenty of time.	Yeroo baay'een qaba.
Check out this answer and it might help.	Deebii kana ilaalaa gargaaruu danda'a.
I didn’t want any of that part.	Kutaa sana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
Everyone is different.	Namni hundi adda adda.
But it wasn’t enough.	Garuu gahaa hin turre.
They will provide assistance.	Gargaarsa ni godhu.
They know a lot about each other.	Waa'ee walii waan baay'ee beeku.
It was a rough night.	Halkan sun hedduu ture.
That happens, most of the time.	Sun ni ta’a, yeroo baay’ee.
I know you can do it.	Akka dandeessu nan beeka.
I then looked up at her.	Anis sana booda ol jedhee ishee ilaale.
The interview was really good.	Gaaffii fi deebii dhuguma gaarii ture.
Very good indeed.	Baayyee gaarii dha dhuguma.
I don’t want to meet them.	Isaan waliin wal arguu hin barbaadu.
Really, really good.	Dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii dha.
Before him.	Isa dura.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
It had to be all of that.	Sana hunda ta'uu qaba ture.
Why her? 	Maaliif ishee?
Who knows what happened.	Waan ta'e eenyutu beeka.
Look closely at this picture.	Suuraa kana akka gaariitti ilaalaa.
They could talk about it later.	Booda waaʼee isaa dubbachuu dandaʼu turan.
No such luck, yet.	Carraa akkasii hin qabu, ammallee.
It's going to be great.	Guddaa ta'a.
I have nothing against him.	Ani homaa isa irratti hin qabu.
But nothing seems to work.	Garuu wanti hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
No one else can do it.	Namni biraa gochuu hin danda'u.
I didn't know what had happened.	Waan ta'e hin beeku ture.
I do this quite often.	Kana yeroo baay'ee nan godha.
Right now, I don’t think it matters.	Yeroo ammaa kana, waan barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu.
Sometimes it’s a must.	Yeroo tokko tokko dirqama.
Probably in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa ta'uu hin oolu.
Everything is hopeless.	Wanti hundi abdii hin qabu.
They have a chance.	Carraa qabu.
I don’t know if that even works.	Sun illee akka hojjetu hin beeku.
I know what you’re thinking.	Waan ati yaaddu nan beeka.
It will never be enough.	Gonkumaa gahaa hin ta'u.
Even that wasn’t easy.	Sun illee salphaa hin turre.
Not two, not three.	Lama miti, sadii miti.
I didn't see it.	Hin argine.
I'm looking for a good house.	Mana gaarii barbaadaa jira.
He knows himself.	Of beeka.
More like three.	Caalaatti akka sadii.
This one was great.	Inni kun guddaa ture.
This one didn’t have one.	Kun tokko hin qabu ture.
But this was really, really great.	Garuu kun dhuguma, dhuguma guddaa ture.
He said good again.	Gaarii jedhe ammas.
It won't be a school.	Mana barumsaa hin ta'u.
Not too big of a deal.	Baayyee guddaa miti.
There was nothing there.	Achitti wanti tokkollee hin turre.
He knows he's right.	Sirrii ta'uu isaa ni beeka.
I like it, I love it.	Natti tola, ni jaalladha.
It won't be easy.	Salphaa hin ta'u.
How exactly does this work?	Kun sirriitti akkamitti hojjeta?
Not in weeks, not in days, now.	Torban keessatti miti, guyyaa keessatti miti, amma.
We don’t need some reason.	Sababni tokko tokko nu hin barbaachisu.
To become a human being.	Nama ta'uuf.
Maybe it's just me.	Tarii ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
No one was looking for her.	Namni ishee barbaadu hin turre.
I’m just at work.	Ani hojii qofa irra jira.
We have to do something.	Waan hojjechuu qabna.
If it works, it works.	Yoo hojjete ni hojjeta.
I want that kind of life.	Jireenya akkasii nan barbaada.
I don’t know anyone around here.	Nama naannoo as jiru hin beeku.
He wasn’t dangerous.	Inni balaa hin qabu ture.
She was outside herself.	Ofii ishee ala turte.
Maybe it's for you.	Tarii siif ta'uu danda'a.
I'm getting really good at this.	Kana irratti dhuguma gaarii ta'aa jira.
It can work both ways.	Karaa lamaan hojjechuu danda’a.
I can't tell you how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e sitti himuu hin danda'u.
You should have known.	Beekuu qabda turte.
You have years and years.	Waggaa fi waggaa qabda.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
I absolutely do this.	Ani guutummaatti kana nan godha.
Not that he can do much.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu danda'a jechuu miti.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
That way everything lives better for me.	Akkasitti wanti hundi caalaatti natti jiraata.
If not, it will happen.	Yoo hin taane ni ta'a.
Today was a mistake, a big one.	Har'a dogoggora, guddaa ta'ee ture.
It was fine to stay indoors during the day.	Guyyaa mana keessa turuuf gaarii ture.
It is not implemented.	Hojii irra hin oolu.
That's usually pretty nice.	Sun yeroo baayyee baayyee namatti tola.
It happens with me a lot.	Baay'ee na waliin ta'a.
Just get to know them.	Isaan beekuu qofa.
I think it's a very good thing.	Waan baayyee gaarii natti fakkaata.
He has what we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu qaba.
In many rooms.	Kutaa baay'ee keessatti.
Still, it doesn't matter.	Ammas ta'ee, homaa hin qabu.
A little bit bigger.	Xiqqoo guddaa.
I have no idea how to do any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee akkamitti akkan godhu yaada hin qabu.
It is in very good condition.	Haala baayyee gaarii irra jira.
He was good with them.	Isaan waliin gaarii ture.
You are among friends.	Hiriyyoota keessa jirta.
Still, just like this.	Ammas ta'ee, akkuma kana.
Everything is brand new.	Wanti hundi guutummaatti haaraa dha.
No one seems to do it.	Namni waan godhu hin fakkaatu.
Maybe, I thought.	Tarii jedheen yaade.
We were alone in the room.	Kutaa keessa kophaa keenya turre.
I have no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
It’s not what you think.	Waan ati yaaddu miti.
His contemporaries knew this.	Namoonni bara isaa turan kana ni beeku turan.
As you have a duty.	Akkuma dirqama qabdu.
It never works.	Yoomiyyuu hin hojjetu.
Nothing else to do, really.	Waan biraa hojjechuu hin qabu, dhuguma.
He was very clear about that.	Waa'ee sanaa baay'ee ifa ta'ee ture.
They were not in that.	Isaan sana keessa hin turre.
But this is not enough.	Garuu kun gahaa miti.
He was trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa ture.
They come here.	Isaan as dhufu.
That doesn't happen often.	Sun yeroo baayyee hin ta'u.
Everything looks so bad.	Wanti hundi akka malee hamaa fakkaata.
I know people who have him.	Namoota isa qaban nan beeka.
But many of them did not understand.	Garuu baay'een isaanii hin hubanne.
This has never happened before.	Kun kanaan dura ta’ee hin beeku.
It was a great feeling.	Miira guddaa ture.
All he had done all his life was exactly what he wanted.	Jireenya isaa guutuu wanti inni hojjete sirriitti waan barbaade qofa ture.
We don’t need this.	Kana nu hin barbaachisu.
Look for us in a week.	Torban tokko booda nu barbaadaa.
But you are here, not going home.	Ati garuu as jirta malee gara manaatti hin deemtu.
This didn’t happen.	Kun hin taane.
Really, really, it does.	Dhuguma, dhuguma, ni godha.
You can’t help your friends.	Hiriyyoota kee gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
Such a great book.	Kitaaba guddaa akkasii.
She’d have to be with him, help him.	Isa waliin ta’uu qabdi turte, isa gargaaruu qabdi turte.
You and your mother.	Ati fi haadha kee.
I really wanted that.	Sana baay'ee barbaade.
I like to eat two ways.	Karaa lama nyaachuu nan jaalladha.
You may have to get it.	Argachuu qabaachuu dandeessa.
You need them.	Isaan si barbaachisa.
I love dogs.	Saree nan jaalladha.
Now it was him.	Amma isa ture.
They will come from within.	Isaan keessaa ni dhufu.
She had to do a job.	Hojii hojjechuu qabdi turte.
I didn't want to go back like that.	Akkasitti deebi'uu hin barbaanne.
I'm not joking.	Ani qoosaa miti.
He looked up at me.	Ol jedhee na ilaale.
Not just today.	Har'a qofa miti.
It could be his imagination.	Yaada isaa ta'uu danda'a.
I don’t want to see him do that.	Akkas godhu arguu hin barbaadu.
I had no idea what to do.	Maal akkan godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
All the best.	Gaarii hunda.
From where we were we couldn't see why.	Bakka turre irraa maaliif akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye.
She has no sense.	Isheen miira hin qabdu.
It may or may not work.	Hojjechuu fi hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
He was in a bad mood.	Miira hamaa keessa ture.
No one was around to help her.	Namni ishee gargaaru naannoo sana hin turre.
I hope that’s not the case for you.	Siif akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
Must be one of his father's.	Kan abbaa isaa keessaa tokko ta'uu qaba.
You're out there.	Ati ala jirta.
Try it with this.	Kanaan yaalaa.
It was the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ta'e ture.
This is not the current situation.	Kun haala amma jiru kana miti.
Meaning can sometimes be a problem.	Jechuun yeroo tokko tokko rakkoo ta'uu danda'a.
He certainly is.	Inni akka ta’e beekamaadha.
Just like mine.	Akkuma kan koo.
But that’s just us.	Garuu sun nu qofa.
In a wife's house.	Haadha mana tokko keessa.
He loves that.	Sana ni jaallata.
He was in serious trouble.	Rakkoo hamaa keessa ture.
You may wonder why that is.	Maaliif akkas taʼe jettanii yaaddu taʼa.
He was very curious.	Inni baayʼee fedhii guddaa qaba ture.
He would have loved it that way.	Silaa akkasitti ni jaallata ture.
Tell him what happened.	Waan ta'e itti himi.
You have a feeling.	Miira qabda.
I really think this is going to be great.	Dhuguma kun guddaa ta'uuf deema jedheen yaada.
There is no other like her.	Kan akka ishee kan biraa hin jiru.
I really wanted to believe her.	Ishee amanuu baay'ee barbaade.
No one can tell me why .	Maaliif akka ta'e namni natti himu hin jiru .
I don't understand.	Naaf hin galle.
It certainly has no interest in you, but .	Siif fedhii tokkollee akka hin qabne beekamaadha, garuu .
A completely different person.	Nama adda ta'e guutummaatti.
There is one exception, however.	Kan kanaan ala ta'e tokko garuu jira.
This shouldn't have been a big deal.	Kun waan guddaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
Only it’s not that simple.	Qofa akkas salphaa miti.
Not the same person.	Nama tokko miti.
But this would work.	Garuu kun ni hojjeta ture.
So he went away for a while.	Kanaaf yeroo muraasaaf ni deeme.
Now you need that.	Amma sana si barbaachisa.
A lot of it.	Baay'ee isaa.
She had to say something.	Waan tokko dubbachuu qabdi turte.
He’s definitely older than me.	Inni na caalaa umuriin isaa hin oolu.
One meal, please.	Nyaata tokko maaloo.
I don’t need it here anymore.	Kana booda asitti na hin barbaachisu.
I didn’t realize it then.	Yeroo sana hin hubanne ture.
This was a lot.	Kun baay'ee ture.
I can't do anything about her.	Waa'ee ishee homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
I can see him now.	Amma isa arguu nan danda'a.
I told him about my day.	Waa'ee guyyaa koo itti hime.
This should be clear.	Kun ifa ta’uu qaba.
He didn’t do it anymore.	Kana booda hin goone.
I couldn’t believe it, but she was right.	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye, garuu isheen sirrii turte.
We need to have help.	Gargaarsa qabaachuu qabna.
They have two children.	Ijoollee lama qabu.
But it sounds like you know that.	Garuu akka waan kana beektu fakkaata.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Kana jechuun homaa jechuu miti.
I can tell you very well.	Akka gaariitti sitti himuu nan danda'a.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Garuu isa qofa hin turre.
He couldn't live.	Jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
It’s inside.	Keessaa dha.
But right now he is the right person.	Yeroo ammaa kana garuu nama sirrii dha.
With his own hands.	Harka isaatiin.
I didn’t think so.	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu ture.
You know what that sounds like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu beekta.
What he meant was clear.	Wanti inni jechuu barbaade ifa ture.
It’s good for him.	Isaaf gaarii dha.
Once he saw someone who looked like her.	Yeroo tokko nama ishee fakkaatu tokko arge.
It was only a few weeks.	Torban muraasa qofa ture.
I don't know how that could happen.	Akkamitti akkas ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
Just like you were.	Akkuma ati turte.
He looks a lot like you.	Inni baay'ee si fakkaata.
I am not one of them.	Ani isaan keessaa tokko miti.
But look at it.	Garuu ilaalaa.
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
He certainly doesn’t know me.	Inni akka na hin beekne beekamaadha.
We have plenty of food.	Nyaata baay'ee qabna.
Cause.	Sababa.
You never do it.	Ati gonkumaa hin gootu.
He is still in it.	Ammallee keessa jira.
No one knows where he is.	Eessa akka jiru namni beeku hin jiru.
You can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
Couldn't have done it without him.	Isa malee gochuu hin danda'u ture.
You know you don’t see anything wrong.	Waan hamaa akka hin argine beekta.
I thought I should get some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko argachuu qaba jedheen yaade.
He does none of that here though.	Inni garuu asitti sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjetu.
Nothing can go wrong now.	Amma wanti dogoggora ta'uu danda'u hin jiru.
You can do it.	Ni dandeessaa.
It was always his name.	Yeroo hundumaa maqaa isaa ture.
I doubt they are on her.	Ishee irra jiraachuu isaanii nan shakka.
She is not a wife.	Isheen haadha manaa miti.
They were all there.	Hundi isaanii achi turan.
But she should have known better.	Garuu kana caalaa beekuu qabdi turte.
He was doing both things.	Waan lamaan hojjechaa ture.
I mean, when he was there.	Yeroo inni achi ture jechuu kooti.
No one else did.	Namni biraa hin goone.
It’s really not like that.	Dhuguma akkas miti.
But he hadn’t done any of that.	Garuu waan sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne ture.
At my house.	Mana kootti.
You still can’t get a job.	Ammas hojii argachuu hin dandeessu.
He fully intended to stay.	Guutummaatti turuuf yaada qaba ture.
If not, you may not get much.	Yoo hin taane, waan baayʼee argachuu dhiisuu dandeessa.
But everything seemed fine, everything seemed fine.	Garuu wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata ture, wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
Maybe she's interested.	Tarii fedhii qabdi ta'a.
It turned out very well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee ba'e.
They could have been there.	Silaa achi jiraachuu danda'u.
I'm pretty much the only one who ever does that.	Ani qofa jechuun ni danda'ama kan yoomiyyuu akkas godhu.
I wasn't really sure.	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Tell him what he needs to do.	Waan gochuu qabu itti himi.
But then he goes away.	Sana booda garuu ni deema.
From one day.	Guyyaa tokko irraa.
They never have it.	Isaan gonkumaa hin qaban.
They have similar job functions.	Hojii hojii wal fakkaatu qabu.
No one was here.	Namni as hin turre.
He is a good man.	Inni nama gaarii dha.
Everything that can happen.	Waan ta'uu danda'u hunda.
But it’s likely that no one is.	Garuu namni tokkollee akka hin jirre hin oolu.
I am not that person.	Ani nama sana miti.
But nothing like that happened that day.	Garuu guyyaa sanatti wanti akkasii hin taane.
I am one of those guys.	Ani warra sana keessaa tokko.
He told her that it was.	Akka ta'e itti hime.
He is going this way.	Karaa kanaan deemaa jira.
I wasn’t in one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko keessa hin turre.
Very good.	Gaarii baay'ee.
Perhaps that could work.	Tarii sun hojjechuu dandaʼa.
He did a good job of it.	Hojii gaarii itti hojjete.
I know that wasn’t easy.	Sun salphaa akka hin turre nan beeka.
Some people not so much.	Namoonni tokko tokko hangas miti.
Went and looked a lot.	Deeme baay'ee ilaalaa.
But no one saw him.	Garuu namni isa arge hin jiru.
In this case .	Haala kana keessatti .
It used to be much worse than it is now, obviously.	Duraan amma jiru caalaa baayyee hamaa akka ture ifaadha.
There is nothing else.	Kanaan ala wanti jiru hin jiru.
I won’t be here in the morning.	Ganama as hin dhufu.
I didn’t think anything of it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti homaa itti hin yaadne.
Just my two parents.	Warra koo lamaan qofa.
Let me just think about it.	Mee akkan yaadu qofa.
But that wasn't often.	Garuu sun yeroo baay'ee hin turre.
That was just a job for him.	Sun isaaf hojii qofa ture.
All of us.	Hundi keenya.
This works well enough.	Kun akka gaariitti hojjeta.
It looked good.	Gaarii fakkaata ture.
I mean to tell you.	Sitti himuu jechuu kooti.
We saw the kids at parties	Ijoollee affeerraa irratti argine
He thought about that one.	Waa'ee isa sanaa yaade.
He wanted to know all the facts.	Dhugaa jiru hunda beekuu barbaade.
I'm pretty good at that sort of thing.	Ani waan akkasii irratti baay'een ga'umsa qaba.
I want to buy from them.	Isaan irraa bitachuu barbaada.
But so very great many.	Garuu akkas baayyee guddaa baay'een.
It was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture.
I wanted to come back after 30 years.	Waggaa 30 booda deebi'uu barbaadaa ture.
It’s better for us than anything else.	Hunda caalaa nuuf wayya.
She just had it.	Isheen qofa qabdi turte.
I think about here.	Ani waa'ee asitti yaada.
He was going to school.	Gara mana barumsaa deemaa ture.
He was still in her life.	Inni ammallee jireenya ishee keessa ture.
Sometimes the room that would have been there before.	Yeroo tokko tokko kutaa silaa duraan ture sana.
You have to tell him that.	Ati akkas itti himuu qabda.
Now you know why.	Amma sababa isaa beekta.
But it’s better.	Garuu wayya.
Were they real?.	Isaan dhugaa turan?.
I think otherwise.	Ani garuu waan biraa natti fakkaata.
I mean, you know.	Beekta jechuu kooti.
Not much chance of that.	Carraan sanaa baay'ee miti.
It came out of their light.	Ifa isaanii keessaa ba'e.
He will father his own children.	Ijoollee ofii ni abbaa ta’a.
But, it happened and it happened.	Garuu, ta'e ni ta'e.
They may have a week.	Torban tokko qabaachuu danda'u.
It's all still there, now.	Hundi ammallee jira, amma.
That would be a lot of days.	Sun guyyaa baay'ee ta'a.
This is obviously incorrect.	Kun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
Her true self.	Ofii ishee isa dhugaa.
Just what he needs.	Waan isa barbaachisu qofa.
They have it there.	Achitti qabu.
I'm thinking about it.	Ani itti yaada.
We don’t really need any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee dhuguma nu hin barbaachisu.
But it was very much like that.	Garuu baayyee akkas ture.
They were like dogs.	Isaan akka saree turan.
It could happen here.	Asitti ta'uu danda'a.
You could say it was around us.	Naannoo keenya ture jechuu dandeessu.
He is a very nice person.	Nama baayyee namatti tola.
Now she would never know why.	Amma maaliif akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beektu turte.
The great one.	Kan guddaa.
Hers, that’s it.	Kan ishee, kanuma.
He wants me.	Na barbaada.
What could it be	Maal ta'uu danda'a
You’re here now.	Amma as jirta.
But those were the exception.	Garuu sun kanaan ala turan.
So much for waiting.	Eegaa baay'ee.
Nothing is different from anything else.	Wanti biraa irraa adda hin jiru.
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu akkas miti.
We are both alone.	Lamaan keenya kophaa keenya.
He said he had.	Akka qabu jedhe.
I don’t have a car.	Konkolaataa hin qabu.
Was it you?.	Ati turee?.
We were so great together, but we were just kids.	Waliin baayyee guddaa turre, garuu ijoollee qofa turre.
By then it will be too late.	Yeroo sanatti yeroon isaa baayʼee booda taʼa.
I am one of you.	Ani isin keessaa tokko.
We need things to do in that situation.	Haala sana keessatti wantoota hojjechuu qabnu nu barbaachisa.
Very, very good.	Baayyee baayyee gaarii dha.
So I think it works for me.	Kanaaf waan naaf hojjetu natti fakkaata.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Dogoggora, dogoggora, dogoggora.
It wasn’t like that and it wasn’t true.	Akkas hin turre dhugaa hin turre.
They knew better.	Isaan caalaatti beeku turan.
Drink over emotion.	Miira irra dhugaa.
You are my boyfriend.	Ati gurbaa kooti.
But you would love it.	Garuu ni jaallattu turte.
You can do it with your kids.	Ijoollee keessan waliin hojjechuu dandeessu.
Then it was different.	Sana booda adda ture.
There is nothing.	Wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
She didn't want everyone to know about her.	Waa'ee ishee namni hundi akka beeku hin barbaanne.
In most cases.	Yeroo baay’ee keessatti.
Why didn't you tell us about her?	Maaliif waa'ee ishee nutti hin himne?
I love it that much.	Ani hangas nan jaalladha.
It's just a dog.	Saree qofa.
One better act quickly.	Namni dafee waan tokko hojjechuu wayya.
It wasn’t just his desire, it was hers.	Fedhii isaa qofa osoo hin taane, kan ishee ture.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a.
There's really only one person this could be.	Dhuguma namni kun ta'uu danda'u tokko qofa.
It will be a great opportunity for you.	Carraa guddaa siif ta'a.
It’s not just my job.	Hojii koo qofa miti.
No one else was around.	Namni biraa naannoo sana hin turre.
I didn’t know anything.	Ani homaa hin beeku ture.
We were very wrong.	Baay'ee dogoggora turre.
It was just a joke.	Qoosaa qofa ture.
He is still there.	Ammallee achi jira.
He would do it.	Ni godha ture.
It’s my job.	Hojii kooti.
I want her here.	Asitti ishee barbaada.
I'm happy for him.	Isaaf gammadeera.
He doesn’t need one.	Tokko isa hin barbaachisu.
He is with his mother.	Inni haadha isaa waliin jira.
It came late in time.	Yeroon booda dhufe.
He has to go.	Deemuu qaba.
I don't want him to come.	Akka inni dhufu hin barbaadu.
Where no one could see it.	Bakka namni tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
I want to go.	Deemuun barbaada.
It seemed like a lot at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan baay'ee fakkaata ture.
He was doing fine.	Inni gaarii hojjechaa ture.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
I have her.	Ani ishee qaba.
I enjoyed it.	Itti gammadeera.
I can still do it.	Ammas nan danda'a.
All that stuff is in there.	Wanti sun hundi achi keessa jira.
You have to have that.	Sana qabaachuu qabda.
But that was last year.	Garuu sun bara darbe ture.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Garuu hin dandeenye, ammallee miti.
There are no medical problems.	Rakkoon yaalaa hin jiru.
Here, it wasn’t.	Asitti, hin turre.
It was about everything.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa ture.
But let me make one thing very clear.	Garuu mee waan tokko baay'ee ifa godhu.
That was her job.	Hojiin ishee kanuma ture.
He wants evil.	Inni hamaa barbaada.
He knows when it is.	Yoom akka ta'e ni beeka.
But that’s not true.	Garuu sun dhugaa miti.
I am absolutely thrilled.	Ani guutummaatti gammadeera.
Wait for it.	Eegaa.
It was a small mistake.	Dogoggora xiqqoo ture.
But still nothing.	Garuu ammallee homaa hin qabu.
They were eager to help.	Gargaaruuf fedhii guddaa qabu turan.
You shouldn’t make the same mistake.	Dogoggora wal fakkaatu hojjechuu hin qabdu.
But they are there.	Garuu isaan achi jiru.
That was the one thing he didn’t do.	Wanti inni hin hojjenne tokko kanuma ture.
No one likes him.	Namni isa jaallatu hin jiru.
This doesn't work.	Kun hin hojjetu.
It's not me, though.	Ana miti garuu.
They have little money.	Maallaqa xiqqoo qabu.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
It wasn’t the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii hin turre.
He told me that morning.	Ganama sana natti hime.
Sorry to see you go.	Deemtu arguu kootti dhiifama.
I don't know what's going on.	Maal akka jiru hin beeku.
That was what we had to do.	Wanti nuti gochuu qabnu sun taʼuu qaba ture.
I can get them.	Isaan argachuu nan danda'a.
I have them, but not without a lot of work.	Isaan qaba, garuu hojii baay'ee malee miti.
This is our time.	Yeroon keenya yeroo kana.
Then a dog.	Sana booda saree tokko.
I am looking around at this.	Kana naannoo kootti ilaalaa jira.
But he was on his way.	Inni garuu karaa irra ture.
But he was always right.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa sirrii ture.
As such, it may contain errors.	Akka kanaan dogoggora of keessaa qabaachuu danda’a.
You're at home.	Ati mana jirta.
I suspect that's all.	Kana qofa akka ta'e nan shakka.
It is necessary.	Ni barbaachisa.
Why is it obvious.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekamaadha.
Two things.	Waan lama.
You can’t see him.	Isa arguu hin dandeessu.
This was a bit different.	Kun xiqqoo adda ture.
I passed in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti darbe.
But that doesn’t work anymore.	Garuu sun kana booda hin hojjetu.
Anyone else have any thoughts on this issue?.	Dhimma kana irratti namni biraa yaada qabu jiraa?.
We are very.	Nuti baayyee...
Perhaps he did.	Tarii ni godhe taʼa.
I no longer knew what it was.	Kana booda maal akka taʼe hin beeku ture.
She’s always been like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas turte.
One of them would have been theirs.	Isaan keessaa tokko silaa kan isaanii ta’a ture.
More than it is now.	Amma jiru caalaa.
He had to work.	Hojjechuu qaba ture.
It would have been the right thing to do.	Silaa waan sirrii ta'a ture.
Only it's never been true.	Qofa dhugaa ta'ee hin beeku.
But sometimes you have to.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko dirqama ta'a.
Not that it does but still.	Ni godha jechuu miti garuu ammas.
But there is hope.	Garuu abdiin jira.
People need jobs.	Namoonni hojii barbaadu.
If she had, he might never have gone.	Osoo isheen qabdu ta'ee tarii gonkumaa hin deemu ture.
There was no problem.	Rakkoon ture hin turre ture.
Maybe it's him.	Tarii inni ta'uu danda'a.
You have to do that.	Ati akkas gochuu qabda.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
He tried to help her.	Ishee gargaaruuf yaale.
He loves it up here.	Asitti ol ni jaallata.
I didn't want anything to go wrong tonight.	Halkan kana wanti dogoggora ta'u hin barbaanne.
She was looking for something.	Waan tokko barbaadaa turte.
Not like someone said.	Akkuma namni tokko jedhe miti.
They want the best.	Waan gaarii barbaadu.
They're not perfect, but they can be perfect together.	Isaan guutuu miti, garuu waliin guutuu ta'uu danda'u.
I know you exist.	Ati akka jirtu nan beeka.
She was in a bad mood.	Miira hamaa keessa turte.
She seems to know nothing.	Isheen homaa hin beektu fakkaata.
What he said.	Waan jedhe.
I had never said that.	Ani akkas jedhee hin beeku ture.
But we are not.	Nuti garuu miti.
But it looks good.	Garuu gaarii fakkaata.
I told him, too.	Anis itti hime.
You don’t think it’s a big deal right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti guddaa sitti hin fakkaatu.
I don’t need sleep.	Hirriba na hin barbaachisu.
You have to help us.	Nu gargaaruu qabda.
It was a disaster.	Balaa ture.
Maybe they will.	Tarii ni godhu ta'a.
Not much, perhaps.	Baay'ee miti tarii.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
It should just be up there.	Ol achi qofa jiraachuu qaba.
This time was no exception.	Yeroon kun kanaan ala hin turre.
But, it could be wrong.	Garuu, dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
Nothing else happened, really.	Wanti biraa hin taane, dhuguma.
Time is everything.	Yeroon waan hunda.
It just doesn’t exist.	Hin jiru qofa.
But it is not necessary.	Garuu dirqama miti.
All about the dog.	Waa'ee saree hunda.
That’s on a good day.	Sun guyyaa gaarii irratti.
He asked her not to go.	Akka hin deemne ishee gaafate.
I know.	Beeka.
And now and never!.	Ammas ta'ee gonkumaa!.
It’s the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii dha.
That was so obvious.	Sun akka malee ifa ture.
I'm going to go to him.	Gara isaa nan deema.
That is often the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas taʼa.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
But that wasn’t all.	Garuu kana qofa hin turre.
Sometimes, you have to say the obvious.	Yeroo tokko tokko, waan ifa ta'e dubbachuu qabda.
He was a very tall man.	Nama baayyee dheeraa ture.
It was really bad.	Dhuguma hamaa ture.
It was always about you.	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee kee ture.
No one has it.	Namni qabu hin jiru.
That it was really just another case.	Dhuguma dhimma biraa qofa akka ture.
We should be on our way soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti karaa irra jiraachuu qabna.
This is your problem.	Kun rakkoo keessan.
You're so good!	Baayyee gaarii taate!
It’s different from the old one.	Kan durii irraa adda.
She still has it.	Ammallee qabdi.
It looks really good.	Dhuguma gaarii fakkaata.
Shout.	Iyyuu.
Something was different, something was wrong.	Waan tokko adda ture, waan tokko dogoggora ture.
Maybe, a little bit.	Tarii, xiqqoo.
I think we agreed.	Walii galle jedheen yaada.
But you may not even want to do that.	Garuu akkas gochuu illee hin barbaanne taʼa.
I didn't tell him much.	Waan baay'ee itti hin himne.
We just have to live on it.	Irra jiraachuu qofa qabna.
I gave him everything.	Waan hundumaa itti kenne.
I looked both ways, but couldn't see much.	Karaa lamaan ilaale, garuu waan baay'ee arguu hin dandeenye.
I knew he wasn’t up to any good.	Inni hanga gaarii tokkollee akka hin jirre nan beeka ture.
That sounds pretty bad.	Sun baayyee hamaa fakkaata.
But one does when one can.	Namni tokko garuu yeroo danda'u ni godha.
I was once a human being.	Ani yeroo tokko nama turee.
She did, really.	Isheen akkas goote, dhuguma.
You're not quite right.	Ati baay'ee sirrii miti.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
They weren’t like me.	Isaan akka koo hin turre.
The sooner, the better.	Dafee yoo ta'e garuu gaarii dha.
That's what happened here.	Asitti kan ta'e kanuma.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Sun akka hin taane ifaadha.
He didn't want to see anyone.	Nama arguu hin barbaanne.
I want to know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaada.
But it could be true.	Garuu dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
But they are looking for answers.	Garuu deebii barbaadaa jiru.
I am a mother.	Ani haadha.
He had to live with that.	Sana waliin jiraachuu qaba ture.
That will be very different from you.	Sun baayyee si irraa adda ta'a.
No one goes there right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana namni achi deemu hin jiru.
No one can find us here.	Namni asitti nu argachuu hin danda'u.
Maybe he should have.	Tarii qabaachuu qaba ture.
This past week.	Torban darbe kana.
You just have to ask him.	Isa gaafachuu qofa qabda.
Not again, either.	Ammas miti.
Not in this case.	Haala kana keessatti miti.
Something like that happens.	Wanti akkasii ni ta'a.
You love each other.	Wal jaallattu.
He knew he was in the room.	Kutaa sana keessa akka jiru ni beeka ture.
Look at my hands.	Harka koo ilaalaa.
That’s all we can do.	Kana qofa gochuu dandeenyu.
But there is nothing more.	Garuu kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
There was no answer, no sound.	Deebii tokkollee hin turre, sagalee tokkollee hin turre.
I didn’t have that.	Ani akkas hin qabu ture.
I didn’t know any of this at the time.	Yeroo sanatti kana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku ture.
Provide the necessary funds.	Maallaqa barbaachisu kennuu.
Believe.	Amanuu.
That used to be so easy.	Sun duraan akka malee salphaa ture.
Maybe in your eyes that's wrong.	Tarii ija kee keessatti sun dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
She was a good time girl.	Intala yeroo gaarii turte.
They had me in a very bad place.	Bakka baayyee hamaa keessa na qaban turan.
This has been great.	Kun guddaa ta'ee jira.
It can't go very well.	Baayyee gaarii deemuu hin danda'u.
We have time.	Yeroo qabna.
They have a lot.	Baay'ee qabu.
Helping, apparently.	Gargaaruu, fakkaata.
I hope it happens soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
Fresh from a morning nap.	Hirriba ganama irraa haaraa dha.
Which was usually everyone.	Kan yeroo baayyee nama hunda ture.
People know who you are.	Namoonni eenyu akka taate ni beeku.
This is another thing that happened two years ago.	Kun waan biraa waggaa lama dura ta'ee ture.
He could do no wrong.	Waan hamaa hojjechuu hin danda'u ture.
You really can’t ask for more, can you?.	Dhuguma caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeessu, ni dandeessaa?.
I hope that's all right.	Sun hundi sirrii akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
That’s all perfectly fine.	Sun hundi guutummaatti gaarii dha.
So we just have to leave it here.	Kanaaf asitti dhiisuu qofa qabna.
I never knew it was that big.	Akkas guddaa ta'uu isaa gonkumaa hin beeku.
But he is willing to let the past be the past.	Garuu wanti darbe darbe akka ta'u gochuuf fedhii qaba.
We haven’t agreed on anything yet.	Hanga ammaatti homaa irratti walii hin galle.
It would have been something else.	Silaa waan biraa ta'a ture.
They look great on him.	Isa irratti guddaa fakkaatu.
He disagreed on almost every issue.	Dhimma hunda irratti jechuun ni danda’ama irratti walii hin galle.
We had no money.	Maallaqa hin qabnu turre.
I can't go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
Clearly, he is not human.	Inni nama akka hin taane ifaadha.
It was almost too good to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii ta'uu danda'a jechuun ni danda'ama ture.
I don't have such a chance.	Carraa akkasii hin qabu.
Wait and see.	Eegaa ilaalaa.
That’s nothing to us.	Sun nutti homaa miti.
Not too soon.	Dafee miti.
Take a look!.	Mee ilaalaa!.
He wanted to tell her she was wrong.	Dogoggora akka qabdu itti himuu barbaade.
Then, the other answer is correct.	Sana booda, deebii inni biraa sirrii dha.
I don't like it.	Ani hin jaalladhu.
Just the facts.	Dhugaa jiru qofa.
The bigger the better.	Hamma guddaa ta'e gaarii dha.
It just wasn’t enough.	Qofa gahaa hin turre.
I am looking for a husband.	Abbaa manaa barbaada.
I wouldn't be able to get a job.	Silaa hojii argachuu hin danda'u ture.
He knew these people and their lives.	Namoota kanaa fi jireenya isaanii ni beeka ture.
Just please go.	Qofa mee deemaa.
I didn't see anything	Homaa hin argine .
Almost no one can.	Namni tokkollee hin danda'u jechuun ni danda'ama.
They often have lives outside of work.	Yeroo baayyee hojiin ala jireenya qabu.
It worked for me.	Naaf hojjete.
I don’t like any part of it.	Kutaa isaa tokkollee hin jaalladhu.
This can’t really happen.	Kun dhuguma ta’uu hin danda’u.
That's not going to happen here.	Asitti sun ta'uuf hin deemu.
But he knew she would.	Inni garuu akka isheen gootu beeka ture.
I didn’t know there was such a thing.	Wanti akkasii akka jiru hin beeku ture.
There were three people in the room.	Kutaa sana keessa namoonni sadii turan.
Look at this.	Kana ilaalaa.
Maybe he's right.	Tarii inni sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
Never never never.	Gonkumaa gonkumaa gonkumaa.
I would have been doing a lot today.	Silaa har'a waan baay'ee hojjechaa ture.
Very much like that.	Baayyee akkas.
You have a good eye.	Ija gaarii qabda.
He’s just a human being.	Inni nama qofa.
The problem lay elsewhere.	Rakkoon sun bakka biraa ture.
You have to come.	Dhufuu qabdu.
He wondered why he thought he could now.	Amma maaliif akka danda'u yaade jedhee yaade.
Of course, he knew that wasn’t true.	Sun dhugaa akka hin taane akka beeku beekamaadha.
But here, this time, he was older.	Garuu asitti, yeroo kana, umuriin isaa guddaa ture.
I have a really bad feeling about it.	Waa'ee kanaa miira dhuguma hamaa qaba.
You could have done better.	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa turte.
We don’t need your space.	Bakka keessan nu hin barbaachisu.
But it doesn't matter what came out of his mouth.	Garuu maaltu afaan isaa keessaa ba'e homaa hin qabu.
It’s not always the easy part.	Yeroo hunda kutaa salphaa miti.
But there is time.	Garuu yeroon jiru.
More importantly.	Kan caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
So that was me.	Kanaaf sun ana ture.
I didn’t know what they were supposed to do.	Maal gochuu akka qaban hin beeku ture.
Nothing came out of his mouth.	Wanti afaan isaa keessaa ba'e hin jiru.
Like it's a good thing, not a bad thing.	Akkuma waan gaarii ta'e malee waan hamaa miti.
This should work, please try it.	Kun hojjechuu qaba, mee yaalaa.
That’s what you need.	Kan si barbaachisu kanuma.
But I couldn't do it.	Ani garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
These were bad, bad people.	Kun namoota hamaa, hamaa turan.
I want to know what happened there.	Waan achitti ta'e beekuu barbaada.
He is ever so right.	Inni yoomiyyuu akkasitti sirrii dha.
But he was a good dog.	Garuu inni saree gaarii ture.
It would have been more specific.	Silaa caalaatti adda ta'a ture.
That is, the.	Jechuun isaa.
No one thought it was possible.	Namni ni danda'ama jedhee yaade hin turre.
You can do this.	Kana gochuu dandeessa.
A stranger glared at him from across the street.	Namni hin beekne tokko karaa biraa irraa ija keessa isa ilaale.
But here, there is none.	Garuu asitti, tokkollee hin jiru.
I have no idea what is going on.	Waan deemaa jiru yaada hin qabu.
It was obviously a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa akka ture ifaadha.
There was nothing else to say.	Kan biraa wanti jedhu hin turre.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti as akka dhufu mirkanaa'adha.
He was willing to help.	Gargaaruuf fedhii qaba ture.
Even people do it.	Namoonni illee ni godhu.
Look at this answer.	Deebii kana ilaalaa.
That stuff isn’t going to help him.	Wanti sun isa gargaaruuf hin deemu.
Everything about that idea seemed great.	Yaada sanaa wanti hundi waan guddaa fakkaata ture.
Sorry I can't help anymore.	Dhiifama kana booda gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Not really bad at this.	Dhuguma kana irratti hamaa miti.
If not now, when?.	Yoo amma hin taane yoom?.
I’m at the bar.	Ani mana dhugaatii sana jira.
It’s never easy.	Gonkumaa salphaa miti.
He would never do this.	Kana tasumaa hin godhu ture.
But he had many friends.	Garuu hiriyyoota hedduu qaba ture.
Now, it’s not that simple.	Amma, hangas salphaa miti.
Strangers here.	Asitti nama hin beekne.
But that was very unlikely.	Garuu sun baay'ee hin oolu ture.
That is not true.	Sun dhugaa miti.
So this is it.	Kanaaf isa kana.
I don't want to talk.	Dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
She needed the money.	Maallaqa ishee barbaachisa ture.
I wondered who it was.	Eenyu jedheen yaade.
I want to know what happened later.	Booda maaltu akka ta'e beekuu barbaada.
It just has me.	Ana qofa qaba.
It wants to be on hand.	Harka irratti ta'uu barbaada.
It's going to be bad.	Hamaa ta'uuf deema.
I don’t really know her.	Dhuguma ishee hin beeku.
They knew they were dangerous.	Balaa akka qaban ni beeku turan.
That other part of me.	Kutaa koo isa biraa sana.
I just didn’t know what to do with it.	Maal akkan itti godhu qofa hin beeku ture.
I know them too well.	Ani garmalee isaan beeka.
This time was no exception.	Yeroon kun garuu kanaan ala hin turre.
This was not one of those times.	Yeroon kun yeroo sana keessaa tokko hin turre.
She was doing very well.	Isheen baayyee gaarii hojjechaa turte.
I was really into it for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf dhuguma keessa ture.
He realized now that he didn’t know what to do with it.	Maal akka itti godhu akka hin beekne amma hubate.
Everyone but their father knew this would never happen.	Abbaa isaanii malee namni hundi kun yoomiyyuu akka hin taane beeka ture.
Something that is completely incorrect.	Waan guutummaatti sirrii hin taane.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
Sorry but someone needs to tell you.	Dhiifama garuu namni tokko sitti himuu qaba.
It's just a girl.	Intala qofa.
That’s what we need.	Kan nu barbaachisu kanuma.
So far, no one had found it.	Hanga ammaatti namni argate hin turre.
That's what happened.	Kan ta'e kanuma.
Now that was a new idea.	Amma sun yaada haaraa ture.
Like, that's how it happens.	Akka, akkas ta'a.
I know it’s not me.	Ana akka hin taane nan beeka.
I didn't want to ask.	Gaafachuu hin barbaanne.
He did what he did.	Waan hojjete hojjete.
People want to help.	Namoonni gargaaruu barbaadu.
I don't do that.	Ani akkas hin godhu.
We talked about the same issue.	Dhimma wal fakkaatu dubbanne.
Someone accepted without question.	Namni tokko gaaffii tokko malee fudhate.
But we don’t have to go now.	Garuu amma deemuu hin qabnu.
It was her duty to go.	Deemuun dirqama ishee ture.
I mean, it looked exactly like that picture.	Suuraa sana sirriitti fakkaata ture jechuu kooti.
Now, about the day.	Amma, waa'ee guyyaa sanaa.
So this is wrong.	Kanaaf kun dogoggora.
Something is going to happen in there.	Wanti achi keessa ta'uuf jira.
I had no idea how to do it today.	Har'a akkamitti akkan godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I don't know where you're going.	Eessa akka deemtu hin beeku.
That light just shouldn’t work.	Ifa sun hojjechuu hin qabu qofa.
Now it was so much more.	Amma kana caalaa baayʼee ture.
She should be with her mother.	Haadha ishee waliin ta'uu qabdi.
First, you need to know what you want.	Dura waan barbaaddu beekuu qabda.
Of course he does.	Akka inni godhu beekamaadha.
It had turned out just as he had imagined.	Akkuma inni yaade ta'ee ture.
I know them well enough.	Ani akka gaariitti isaan beeka.
We had no idea what he did.	Waan inni godhe yaada tokkollee hin qabnu turre.
We went in his car.	Konkolaataa isaatiin deemne.
He must have her.	Ishee qabaachuu qaba.
The real thing.	Wanti dhugaa.
Now he was gone.	Amma inni hin jiru ture.
She couldn't believe it was happening.	Ta'aa jira jettee amanuu hin dandeenye.
You know why that is.	Maaliif akkas akka taʼe beekta.
I don't know why though.	Maaliif hin beeku garuu.
We would never do that now.	Amma gonkumaa akkas hin goonu turre.
But that’s what you need most.	Garuu sun hunda caalaa si barbaachisa.
It looked like that.	Akkas fakkaata ture.
I really enjoyed this one.	Isa kana baay'een gammade.
Giving her like that.	Akkasitti ishee kennuu.
I don’t want to do it here.	Asitti gochuu hin barbaadu.
It shouldn’t be like that.	Akkas ta’uu hin qabu.
I'm not good at them.	Ani isaan irratti ga'umsa hin qabu.
I'm happy too.	Anis gammadeera.
This was a very good opportunity.	Kun carraa baayyee gaarii ture.
That never happened.	Sun ta'ee hin beeku.
A lot can happen in a year.	Waggaa tokko keessatti waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a.
No one is in the car.	Namni konkolaataa keessa hin jiru.
You should have your answer there.	Deebii kee achitti qabaachuu qabda.
There was no reason for it.	Sababni itti ta'u hin turre.
Not even once.	Yeroo tokkollee miti.
Not much, he thought.	Baay'ee miti jedhee yaade.
I didn’t see them much.	Baayyee isaan hin argine.
This week is going to be really good.	Torban kun dhuguma gaarii ta'uuf deema.
I didn’t understand what he wanted.	Waan inni barbaadu naaf hin galle.
No one says anything.	Namni homaa jedhu hin jiru.
I didn't know much about him but I knew he was nothing like that.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beeku garuu akkas homaa akka hin taane beeka ture.
That’s my problem.	Rakkoon koo kanuma.
One of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko.
You know what you’re doing.	Waan gootu beekta.
Now you are in your house.	Amma mana kee keessa jirta.
Perhaps she was.	Tarii isheen akkas turte taʼa.
Can you suggest what might happen?.	Waan ta'uu danda'u yaada kennuu dandeessu?.
How could it have happened.	Akkamitti ta'uu danda'a ture.
That was pretty cool.	Sun baayyee namatti tola ture.
That means he does the right thing.	Kana jechuun waan sirrii ta’e hojjeta.
said.	jedhe.
It looked too good to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii fakkaata ture.
All of this will be true.	Kun hundi dhugaa ta’ee ni ta’a.
Join us for the journey.	Nu waliin ta'aa.
But this was not the case	Kun garuu akkas hin turre .
I will never go to that place.	Bakka sana gonkumaa hin deemu.
Such as.	Kan akka.
Compare with the picture, please.	Suuraa waliin wal bira qabaa mee.
Then I couldn't.	Sana booda hin dandeenye.
But he shouldn't do anything.	Garuu homaa gochuu hin qabu.
But now I couldn't say that.	Amma garuu akkas jechuu hin dandeenye.
It's not the same thing.	Waan tokko miti.
Mine doesn’t do that.	Kan koo akkas hin godhu.
He bought a new pair of shoes.	Kophee haaraa bite.
But that wasn’t enough.	Garuu sun gahaa hin turre.
I’m glad to know.	Beekuu kootti gammadeera.
He was a local guy.	Inni gurbaa naannoo sanaa ture.
Among them.	Isaan keessaa.
I was right.	Sirrii jedheen ture.
Not like here.	Akka as miti.
But this week we went a long way.	Torban kana garuu karaa dheeraa deemne.
He was right about one thing.	Waan tokko irratti sirrii ture.
One great job.	Hojii guddaa tokko.
He should have done it.	Silaa gochuu qaba ture.
Nothing so easy.	Homaa akkas salphaa hin qabu.
I can't help it much.	Ani baay'ee gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Only now did he realize why.	Maaliif akka ta'e kan hubate amma qofa.
He knew we were together again.	Ammas akka waliin taane beeka ture.
Where she’s likely to stay.	Bakka isheen turuu hin oolle.
Tell me what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru natti himi.
I wondered if you would think so.	Akkas jettanii yaaddu jedheen yaade.
It wants to be me.	Ana ta'uu barbaada.
I will do whatever I can to help.	Gargaaruuf waanan danda'u hunda nan godha.
I want to know everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hundumaa beekuu barbaada.
He needs a new pair of shoes.	Kophee haaraa isa barbaachisa.
The present is not the time.	Yeroon ammaa yeroo miti.
That’s what we need to know.	Kan beekuu qabnu kanuma.
I can't go any further.	Kana caalaa deemuu hin danda'u.
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
The timing may be right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
It just can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
I'm going there.	Ani achi deemaa jira.
When you.	Yeroon ati...
Not good enough, probably.	Gaarii hin qabu, tarii.
I need someone to walk me through.	Nama keessa na deemu na barbaachisa.
He certainly wouldn’t go the other way.	Karaa biraa akka hin deemne beekamaadha.
It matters a lot.	Baay'ee dhimma qaba.
I don't want this to happen to anyone else.	Kun nama biraa irratti akka ta'u hin barbaadu.
He wanted to know then.	Yeroo sana beekuu barbaade.
By doing this.	Kana gochuudhaan.
Which he did.	Kan inni godhe.
This is on him.	Kun isa irra jira.
Why not now?.	Amma maaliif hin taane?.
It just doesn’t work on me.	Ana irratti garuu hin hojjetu qofa.
This just can't be true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
It was a different time of day.	Yeroon guyyaa adda ture.
I'm a good guy.	Ani gurbaa gaarii dha.
He had to know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba ture.
I don't know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
It works for me in both of those times.	Yeroo sana lamaan keessatti naaf ta'a.
A new life, perhaps.	Jireenya haaraa, tarii.
My whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu.
It wasn't going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin turre.
I went with that.	Sana waliin deeme.
I didn’t know you were trying.	Akka ati yaalaa jirtu hin beeku ture.
Always.	Yeroo hundumaa.
She obviously has feelings.	Miira akka qabdu ifaadha.
But it was just me.	Garuu ana qofa ture.
There is no problem there.	Achitti rakkoon hin jiru.
It does me a lot of good there.	Gaarii baay'ee achitti naaf godha.
More likely three.	Caalaatti sadii.
It must be that time of year again.	Ammas yeroo waggaa sana ta'uu qaba.
It was his only hope.	Abdii isaa qofa ture.
We have been waiting for this for a long time.	Kana yeroo dheeraa eegaa turre.
That's probably good, but not a good feeling.	Sun gaarii ta'uu hin oolu, garuu miira gaarii hin taane.
She was wrong.	Dogoggora turte.
Been there, done that.	Achi ture, akkas godhe.
I know people she knows.	Namoota isheen beektu nan beeka.
We don’t have a single date.	Guyyaa tokkollee hin qabnu.
We need two for these people.	Namoota kanaaf lama nu barbaachisa.
I need to do this.	Kana gochuun na barbaachisa.
But this time.	Garuu yeroo kana.
I like to get feedback.	Yaada argachuu nan jaalladha.
But this is obvious.	Garuu kun ifaadha.
He was a very good man.	Nama baayyee gaarii ture.
The excellent one was absolutely huge.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e guutummaatti guddaa ture.
I really have no feelings about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee kanaa miira tokkollee hin qabu.
I don’t know how to help you.	Akkamitti akkan si gargaaru hin beeku.
We like it good here.	Asitti gaarii nutti tola.
This was a loud place to be alone.	Kun bakka sagalee guddaa qabu ture kophaa ta'uuf.
A chance to do something different.	Carraa waan adda ta'e hojjechuuf.
I'm waiting.	Ani eegaa jira.
Except for what we did together, there’s nothing in common.	Waan waliin hojjenne malee, wanti wal fakkaatu hin jiru.
I think that’s just ridiculous.	Sun qoosaa qofa natti fakkaata.
You don’t have to do this alone.	Kana kophaa kee gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Kun akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
This is that person.	Kun nama sana.
I'm trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa jira.
Not so good.	Akkas gaarii miti.
He was right.	Inni sirrii ture.
That’s not a new issue.	Sun dhimma haaraa miti.
She was so very good.	Akkasitti baayyee gaarii turte.
I need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuun na barbaachisa.
I probably still do.	Ammallee akkan godhu hin oolu.
I think that’s obvious.	Sun ifa natti fakkaata.
I didn’t think it was bad.	Hamaa natti hin fakkaatu ture.
Problems in sleep.	Rakkoo hirriba keessa jiru.
But things are different now.	Garuu amma wanti adda ta'e.
But it will happen.	Garuu ni ta'a.
We all wanted to go.	Hundi keenya deemuu barbaanne.
One of two things would happen.	Waan lama keessaa tokko ni ta'a ture.
This is important.	Kun barbaachisaa dha.
They must be.	Ta'uu qabu.
I could imagine.	Yaadu nan danda'a ture.
For you.	Siif.
But you can never be complete without him.	Garuu isa malee gonkumaa guutuu ta'uu hin dandeessu.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
But it should be good most of the time.	Garuu yeroo baayyee gaarii ta'uu qaba.
They have many children.	Ijoollee hedduu qabu.
I don’t like to comment on it.	Yaada tokkollee irratti kennuu hin jaalladhu.
She still hadn't told him.	Ammallee itti hin himne turte.
It seemed like a lot of work.	Hojii guddaa fakkaata ture.
He's doing fine.	Inni gaarii hojjechaa jira.
I just need someone here.	Nama as jiru qofa naaf barbaachisa.
I want to know.	Ani beekuu barbaada.
You are absolutely correct.	Ati guutummaatti sirrii dha.
That's why it seems.	Kanaaf fakkaata.
He told us all about it.	Waa'ee isaa hunda nutti hime.
It won't be me.	Ana hin ta'u.
It seemed to help.	Kan gargaaru fakkaata ture.
It didn’t meet my eyes.	Ija koo waliin wal hin argine.
But not really.	Garuu dhuguma miti.
She was at home.	Mana turte.
I'm thinking about it.	Ani itti yaada.
Then again, maybe no one.	Sana booda ammas tarii namni tokkollee hin jiru ta'a.
But he knew it wasn’t.	Garuu akka hin taane beeka ture.
Which came later.	Kan booda dhufe.
Look at that.	Sana ilaalaa.
I didn't think so.	Akkasitti hin yaadne.
But not much.	Garuu baayyee miti.
There was no one to help her.	Namni ishee gargaaru hin turre.
It doesn't seem like that.	Akkas hin fakkaatu.
Wrong.	Dogoggora.
This is not a good thing, this should never happen.	Kun waan gaarii miti, kun gonkumaa ta'uu hin qabu.
Who has nothing.	Eenyu homaa hin qabu.
I could be wrong about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
But the problem is different.	Garuu rakkoon jiru adda.
I hadn’t thought about that question for a while.	Gaaffii sana yeroo muraasaaf hin yaadne ture.
But now she was different.	Amma garuu adda turte.
He was a great man.	Nama guddaa ture.
Not one as dangerous as mine.	Tokko akka koo balaa qabu miti.
Not so this time.	Yeroo kana akkas miti.
I can never go home again.	Amma booda yoomiyyuu gara manaatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
That's probably what happens all the time.	Yeroo hunda kan ta'u kanuma ta'uu hin oolu.
He was in that situation for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf haala sana keessa ture.
But it had happened.	Garuu ta'ee ture.
That went great.	Sun guddaa ta'ee deeme.
Look me in the eyes.	Ija koo keessa na ilaalaa.
People need to know.	Namoonni beekuu qabu.
It would have been the right thing to do.	Silaa waan sirrii hojjechuuf ta'a ture.
Do you really need it? 	Dhuguma si barbaachisa?
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
He’s not on it.	Inni irra hin jiru.
It was very lonely.	Baay'ee kophaa ture.
It was so obvious.	Akkas ifa ture.
I was about to become a mother.	Haadha ta'uuf jedheen ture.
Those two were the worst thing we’ve seen here.	Isaan lamaan sun waan asitti argine hunda caalaa hamaa turan.
But nobody cared at the time.	Garuu yeroo sanatti namni dhimma itti ba'e hin turre.
But you have a big problem.	Garuu rakkoo guddaa qabda.
He should have known better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
It could be something else.	Waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
He’s still human.	Inni ammallee nama.
I was in a somewhat different mood.	Miira hamma tokko adda ta'e keessa ture.
He could have been there for a while.	Silaa yeroo muraasaaf achi jiraachuu danda'a ture.
That was in the long past.	Sun yeroo darbe dheeraa ture.
During.	Yeroo.
I'm pretty sure it's the only one there is.	Kan jiru isa qofa akka ta'e baay'een mirkanaa'adha.
That’s the same thing.	Kanuma sana.
He made her look special.	Akka adda ishee fakkaattu godhe.
I may not be.	Ani ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It took a long, long time.	Yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
He knows it's more than that.	Kana caalaa akka ta'e ni beeka.
I think this should be pretty clear.	Kun baayyee ifa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
I didn't mean that.	Akkas jechuu hin barbaanne.
That's never been a question.	Sun gaaffii ta'ee hin beeku.
This is certainly nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I then saw my mistake.	Anis sana booda dogoggora koo arge.
He went a little ahead of me.	Xiqqoo na dura deeme.
It's just that I happen.	Akkan ta'u qofa.
He was exactly who he wanted to be.	Inni sirriitti nama ta'uu barbaadu ture.
They have to be in the same place.	Bakka tokko ta'uu qabu.
In that car.	Konkolaataa sana keessatti.
That was never the case.	Sun gonkumaa hin turre.
Just her eyes.	Ija ishee qofa.
Not so much anymore.	Hanga kana miti kana booda.
You have to come here.	As dhufuu qabda.
A big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa.
We already had it.	Duraan qabna turre.
It can’t be any other way.	Karaa biraa ta’uu hin danda’u.
I don’t know what I want to do.	Waan gochuu barbaadu hin beeku.
But he has it behind him.	Garuu duubatti qaba.
This time, she was sure.	Yeroo kana, isheen mirkanaa'aa turte.
It did me a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee na godhe.
Not until now.	Hanga kana booda miti.
It was now.	Amma ture.
As it turned out, that didn’t happen.	Akkuma ture, sun hin taane.
But he has one thing.	Waan tokko garuu qaba.
That was important.	Sun barbaachisaa ture.
In this case, he just wasn't sure.	Haala kana keessatti, inni qofa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
And now it went further.	Ammas kana caalaa deeme.
I'm looking for it.	Ani barbaada.
The time was not now.	Yeroon isaa amma hin turre.
There's a lot at stake in that little situation.	Haala xiqqoo sana keessatti waan baay'ee balaa irra jira.
You should have asked him.	Silaa isa gaafachuu qabda turte.
Maybe, a little bit.	Tarii, xiqqoo.
You are not one of us.	Ati nu keessaa tokko miti.
He should have done better.	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu qaba ture.
Not in a month.	Ji'a tokko keessatti miti.
We don’t do that right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana akkas hin goonu.
I need help to make it work again.	Ammas akka hojjetu gargaarsa na barbaachisa.
So sorry, but to do this.	Kanaaf dhiifama, kana gochuuf malee.
It works fine.	Gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I imagine a lifetime without them.	Jireenya guutuu isaan malee jiraachuu nan yaada.
But you have to help me.	Garuu na gargaaruu qabda.
Now he can do whatever he wants.	Amma waan barbaade gochuu danda'a.
That had to come from me.	Sun ana biraa dhufuu qaba ture.
I don't mean me.	Ana jechuu koo miti.
People have to eat.	Namoonni nyaachuu qabu.
I meant nothing by that.	Kana jechuun homaa jechuu koo hin turre.
It goes quickly.	Dafee deema.
You can play them.	Isaan taphachuu dandeessa.
He says he has it.	Qaba jedha.
Making her think.	Akka yaaddu gochuu.
Sometimes he got lucky.	Yeroo tokko tokko carraa argate.
I still have it.	Ammas qaba.
Maybe that's what it is.	Tarii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
You can’t go right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana deemuu hin dandeessu.
Wait a moment.	Yeroo muraasa eegaa.
I think it's all good.	Hundi gaarii natti fakkaata.
Everything looks good.	Wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata.
It’s extremely nice.	Garmalee namatti tola.
That was hers.	Sun kan ishee ture.
Really, really good.	Dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
On my friends.	Hiriyyoota koo irratti.
Please check and.	Mee ilaalaa fi.
Join us for the journey.	Nu waliin ta'aa.
Just wait a little longer.	Xiqqoo eegaa qofa.
There were very few of us.	Baay'ee muraasa turre.
But I think you’re doing fine so far.	Garuu hanga ammaatti waan gaarii hojjechaa jirtu natti fakkaata.
What were you doing?	Maal hojjechaa turte?
It was nothing, though.	Homaa hin turre garuu.
I don't know how that's possible.	Akkamitti sun ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
What? 	Maal?
This was the most dangerous situation.	Kun haala hunda caalaa balaa qabu ture.
They had no answer to it.	Deebii itti hin qaban turan.
He's waiting for you.	Si eegaa jira.
It always had a lot of things in it.	Yeroo hundumaa wantoota baayʼee of keessaa qaba ture.
This is not our problem.	Kun rakkoo keenya miti.
Two years later.	Waggaa lama booda.
I don’t want to do these things.	Wantoota kana gochuu hin barbaadu.
It can be a problem.	Rakkoo ta’uu danda’a.
I still had time, but maybe not quite a whole lot.	Ammallee yeroon qaba ture, garuu tarii baay'ee guutuu miti.
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
None of them said anything.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee homaa hin dubbanne.
You certainly can’t get it from where it is.	Bakka jiru irraa argachuu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
Rarely is it wrong.	Yeroo muraasaaf dogoggora ta'a.
He went with her.	Ishee waliin deeme.
It wouldn't have been right.	Silaa sirrii hin ta'u ture.
I didn't see him.	Ani isa hin argine.
You are making a big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa hojjechaa jirta.
I like it better than that.	Kana caalaa natti tola.
That's what it should be.	Kana ta'uu qaba.
Do you have any questions?	Gaaffii qabduu?
Not sure what happened, of course.	Waan ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti, beekamaadha.
It has to be something that lasts.	Waan turuu qaba.
I know, they must have serious problems.	Ani beeka, rakkoo hamaa qabaachuu qabu.
I have been here a lot.	Baay'ee as tureera.
Wait for me in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa na eegaa.
I'm doing the best I can.	Ani waanan danda'u hunda gochaa jira.
But everyone wanted to make that an issue.	Garuu namni hundi sana dhimma gochuu barbaade.
Maybe even bigger.	Tarii kana caalaa guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
We shouldn’t have them.	Isaan qabaachuu hin qabnu.
she said.	jette.
I doubt you will.	Akka ati gootu nan shakka.
The two are very different indeed.	Lamaan isaanii dhuguma baayyee adda.
It would have been much easier.	Silaa baayyee salphaa ture.
We had that life.	Jireenya sana qabna turre.
That’s just a theory though.	Sun garuu yaada qofa.
Maybe one day.	Tarii guyyaa tokko.
Except that it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa malee.
Who is.	Eenyu ...dha.
He knew his wife well.	Haadha manaa isaa akka gaariitti beeka ture.
You know, when she.	Beektaa, yeroo isheen.
I am not the important one.	Ani isa barbaachisaa miti.
This was important to him.	Kun isaaf barbaachisaa ture.
We wanted to go big.	Guddaa deemuu barbaanne.
No one was at the door at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namni balbala irra hin turre.
Why did you do it.	Maaliif goote.
I couldn’t eat anything.	Homaa nyaachuu hin dandeenye.
Why don't you do that now.	Maaliif amma akkas hin gootu.
I don't like him.	Ani isa hin jaalladhu.
It was none of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
I am not the only one who knows about this place.	Waa'ee bakka kanaa kan beeku ana qofa miti.
It worked for me.	Naaf hojjete.
I didn’t see anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin argine.
This was a good time.	Yeroon kun yeroo gaarii ture.
You might be right.	Sirrii ta'uu dandeessa.
But we were all different.	Garuu hundi keenya adda turre.
Lots of work.	Hojii baay'ee.
Again he went over his reasoning.	Ammas sababa isaa irra deeme.
I wonder what I saw in my eyes.	Ija koo keessatti maal arge jedheen yaada.
Which can be a good thing.	Kan waan gaarii ta'uu danda'u.
You're being ridiculous.	Qoosaa ta'aa jirta.
I couldn't stay.	Turuu hin dandeenye.
I could have left him there.	Silaa achitti isa dhiisuu nan danda'a ture.
I knew it was going to be bad.	Hamaa akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
I need some work on my book.	Kitaaba koo irratti hojii tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
This was what he understood.	Kun waan inni hubate ture.
That's how it was.	Akkas ta'ee ture.
Nobody really cared.	Namni dhuguma dhimma itti ba'e hin jiru.
Some of these people loved me.	Namoota kana keessaa tokko tokko na jaallatu turan.
They want you, not just want you.	Isaan si barbaadu malee si barbaadu qofa miti.
He took three.	Sadii fudhate.
They want to help.	Gargaaruu barbaadu.
It happens with a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee waliin ta'a.
That would be better, he thought.	Sun wayya jedhee yaade.
So it was possible. 	Kanaaf ni danda'ama ture. 
It wouldn’t have needed more.	Silaa kana caalaa hin barbaachisu ture.
I didn’t tell you before.	Kanaan dura sitti hin himne.
Everything you want.	Waan barbaaddu hunda.
It obviously has to be.	Ta'uu akka qabu ifaadha.
It's been for you.	Siif ta'ee jira.
Not all of us.	Hundi keenya miti.
Wait a moment.	Yeroo muraasa eegaa.
They loved her.	Ishee jaallatu turan.
This is the place.	Bakka kana.
We no longer have room in the lab.	Kana booda mana yaalaa keessatti bakka hin qabnu.
It’s not even new.	Haaraa illee miti.
I'm probably.	Ani tarii.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
But it wasn’t him.	Garuu isa hin turre.
What should we do?	Maal gochuu qabna.
I don't have any.	Ani tokkollee hin qabu.
I know you can do it.	Akka ati gochuu dandeessu nan beeka.
They are just here to do a job.	Hojii tokko hojjechuuf qofa as jiru.
I wasn't sure what was going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
That may not be a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
It doesn’t have any existence.	Jiraachuu tokkollee hin qabu.
I'm working tomorrow.	Boru hojjechaa jira.
Being a question today.	Gaaffii har'a ta'uu.
But only if we all agree.	Garuu yoo hundi keenya walii galle qofa.
Not much, really.	Baay'ee miti, dhuguma.
She was just asking.	Isheen gaafachuu qofa turte.
That’s not that different.	Sun hangas adda miti.
I didn't want that to happen again.	Ammas akkas akka ta'u hin barbaanne.
It was becoming a very serious problem.	Rakkoo baayyee hamaa ta'aa ture.
All of you.	Hundi keessan.
Interview two days later.	Guyyaa lama booda gaaffii fi deebii.
They don’t mean as far as it goes.	Hamma itti deemu jechuu isaanii miti.
But he must be alone.	Garuu kophaa isaa ta'uu qaba.
I know this very well.	Dhimma kana sirriitti beeka.
He just looks so bad, right now.	Inni akka malee hamaa qofa fakkaata, yeroo ammaa.
I don’t want to eat anything right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana homaa nyaachuu hin barbaadu.
I want to know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaada.
Just two simple questions.	Gaaffii salphaa lama qofa.
Then it was true.	Sana booda dhugaa ture.
I am a good girl.	Ani intala gaarii dha.
He was the only guy.	Gurbaa isa qofa ture.
But it’s not a good fact.	Garuu dhugaa gaarii miti.
He looked really bad.	Inni dhuguma hamaa fakkaata ture.
This is the newest one.	Kun isa haaraa dha.
Not the 'other' guy.	Gurbaa 'kan biraa' jechuu miti.
I like everything about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa natti tola.
He was a guy who knew the situation.	Gurbaa haala jiru beeku ture.
She was the one.	Isheen turte.
We didn’t, so we couldn’t.	Hin goone, kanaaf hin dandeenye.
You have to come.	Dhufuu qabda.
We needed someone like her there.	Achitti nama akka ishee barbaanne.
It will be a long night, though.	Halkan dheeraa ta'a, garuu.
I didn’t know these people.	Namoota kana hin beeku ture.
That’s perfectly fine.	Sun guutummaatti gaarii dha.
She was the one.	Isheen turte.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
They can help them.	Isaan gargaaruu dandaʼu.
You know best.	Ati hunda caalaa beekta.
It should be good enough.	Gaarii gahaa ta'uu qaba.
There is always more.	Yeroo hundumaa kana caalaa jira.
They are not human beings.	Isaan nama miti.
Nothing matters but you.	Si malee wanti dhimma qabu hin jiru.
Not very good.	Baayyee gaarii miti.
This reason is unique.	Sababni kun adda.
He hadn't, of course.	Hin qabu ture, beekamaadha.
He doesn't tell us.	Nutti hin himu.
It was nothing at all.	Tasumaa homaa hin turre.
You just have to tell them the truth.	Dhugaa jiru itti himuu qofa qabda.
This is very much but he did.	Kun baayyee garuu inni godhe.
He has a book.	Kitaaba qaba.
It was completely new.	Guutummaatti haaraa ture.
Then she was leaving.	Sana booda isheen deemaa turte.
He would make good out of evil.	Inni gaarii hamaa irraa hojjeta ture.
She was just wrong about that.	Isheen waa'ee sanaa dogoggora qofa turte.
He can do something like that.	Waan akkasii hojjechuu danda'a.
Then he became a boy.	Sana booda gurbaa ta'e.
But how? 	Garuu akkamitti?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
We have to see it.	Arguu qabna.
No more little girl.	Kana booda intala xiqqoo hin jirtu.
They were all there.	Hundi isaanii turan.
That's what it was supposed to be.	Kana ta'uu qaba ture.
But it does.	Garuu ni godha.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
I really didn’t know.	Dhuguma hin beeku ture.
I thought I didn’t realize it wasn’t like him.	Akka isaa akka hin taane hin hubanne jedheen yaade.
It worked well for us.	Akka gaariitti nuuf hojjete.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
It happened last week.	Torban darbe ta'e.
But even that wasn’t enough.	Garuu sun illee gahaa hin turre.
He came to me.	Gara koo dhufe.
We were giving it a chance.	Nuuf carraa kennuu keenya ture.
I don’t have it.	Ani hin qabu.
Quickly, and a lot.	Dafee, fi baay'ee.
She said.	Jette.
Maybe two months.	Tarii ji'a lama ta'uu danda'a.
It can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u.
He always wants the worst.	Yeroo hundumaa isa hamaa barbaada.
You owe them nothing.	Ati homaa isaan irraa hin qabdu.
He has no children.	Ijoollee hin qabu.
I want you here with me.	Asitti na waliin si barbaada.
But I'm not sure.	Garuu mirkanaa'aa miti.
Not even a dog.	Saree illee miti.
But not very much.	Garuu baayyee baay'ee miti.
It wasn’t his business.	Dhimma isaa hin turre.
I have two others.	Kan biraa lama qaba.
He is there right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana achi jira.
She doesn't care.	Isheen dhimma hin qabdu.
But it is dangerous.	Garuu balaa dha.
Maybe one day there will be time.	Tarii guyyaa tokko yeroon jiraata ta'a.
If nothing else .	Yoo wanti biraa hin jirre .
I haven’t done any yet.	Ammallee tokkollee hin hojjenne.
This is obviously incorrect.	Kun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
But look at us now.	Garuu amma nu ilaalaa.
Maybe she still has it.	Tarii ammallee ni qabdi ta'a.
It’s not really the same thing.	Dhuguma waan tokko mitii.
What was he doing.	Maal hojjechaa ture.
Two months later, no one knows where he is.	Ji'a lama booda eessa akka jiru namni beeku hin jiru.
To his house	Gara mana isaatti .
Love the idea!.	Yaada jaalladhu!.
What is yours?.	Kan keessan maali?.
We have food.	Nyaata qabna.
He was waiting for me this morning.	Ganama kana na eegaa ture.
Now none of that will happen.	Amma sun tokkollee hin ta'u.
And yet he knew it.	Ammas ta’ee ni beeka ture.
It’s really good.	Dhuguma gaarii dha.
I have no new ideas.	Yaada haaraa hin qabu.
I can see you for what you really are.	Dhuguma maal akka taate si arguu nan danda'a.
He said he wanted to help.	Gargaaruu barbaada jedhe.
I really don’t know who they were.	Dhuguma eenyu akka turan hin beeku.
Good food.	Nyaata gaarii.
But look at it.	Garuu ilaalaa.
This is better.	Kun wayya.
So far, no one has found one.	Hanga ammaatti namni tokko argate hin jiru.
As you go along.	Akkuma deemtu.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun akkas miti.
Most of the time you can't.	Yeroo baayyee hin dandeessu.
Except that it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa malee.
He had to give a little, but not too much.	Xiqqoo kennuu qaba ture, garuu baay'ee hin turre.
Just like you.	Akkuma kee.
He has a very good idea.	Yaada baayyee gaarii ta'e qaba.
She is not at home.	Mana hin jirtu.
Not in her room.	Kutaa ishee keessa miti.
One thing she’s not good at.	Wanti isheen itti hin dandeenye tokko.
There is no such thing in there.	Achi keessa wanti akkasii hin jiru.
Tell me why you want it.	Maaliif akka barbaaddu natti himi.
It might even help.	Gargaaruu illee danda'a.
She didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akka gootu hin beektu turte.
They would have needed it next year.	Silaa bara dhufu isaan barbaachisa ture.
He had a few friends.	Hiriyyoota muraasa qaba ture.
I don't know how this happened.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
We all need to do more.	Hundi keenya kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
At that time it would have.	Yeroo sanatti silaa.
He wasn’t that kind of guy.	Inni gurbaa akkasii hin turre.
He knew what she wanted.	Waan isheen barbaaddu ni beeka ture.
They have everything.	Waan hundumaa qaban.
It doesn’t come twice.	Yeroo lama hin dhufu.
I wanted to say that.	Ani akkas jedheen barbaade.
She was a good girl.	Intala gaarii turte.
But they know this.	Garuu isaan kana ni beeku.
There were a few facts.	Dhugaa jiru muraasa ture.
But he wasn’t there long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa achi hin turre.
I couldn’t believe what she had done.	Waan isheen goote amanuu hin dandeenye.
You really don’t have to do it.	Dhuguma hojjechuu hin qabdu.
He never was.	Inni gonkumaa hin turre.
I don’t want any of yours.	Kan keessan tokkollee hin barbaadu.
I might be able to help.	Gargaaruu nan dandaʼa taʼa.
It may exist, but it may not.	Jiraachuu danda'a, garuu jiraachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
Maybe you didn't understand.	Tarii hin hubanne ta'a.
Our work didn’t work.	Hojiin keenya hin hojjenne.
Look closely at this picture.	Suuraa kana sirriitti ilaalaa.
I loved my mother.	Haadha koo nan jaalladha ture.
It went well enough.	Gaarii ta'ee deeme.
Now they had it.	Amma qaban turan.
There is still time to do something.	Ammallee yeroon waan tokko hojjechuuf jira.
I was, of course, better than all that.	Ani, beekamaadha, sana hunda caalaa ture.
I can tell you what to do with that.	Sana maal akka gootu sitti himuu nan danda'a.
It couldn't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeenye.
Still a good idea.	Ammas yaada gaarii dha.
Everyone has a chance.	Namni hundi carraa qaba.
But I'm not even sure about that.	Garuu sana illee mirkanaa'aa miti.
You don’t know what you have up there.	Waan achi ol qabdu hin beektu.
I need more than that.	Kana caalaa na barbaachisa.
He wasn’t in it.	Inni keessa hin turre.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
She will never love you.	Yoomiyyuu si hin jaallattu.
He wasn’t even human anymore.	Kana booda nama illee hin turre.
They can do this.	Kana gochuu danda’u.
They are outside the room.	Kutaa ala jiru.
I would love to stay here again.	Ammas as turuu nan jaalladha.
That wouldn't be the case today.	Har'a akkas hin ta'u ture.
That’s all it does so far.	Hanga ammaatti kan hojjetu kana qofa.
It’s not clear.	Ifa miti.
When I was, there was no time.	Yeroon ture yeroon hin turre.
I don't know anything about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku.
He was a really nice guy.	Dhuguma nama gaarii ture.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Garuu eessa akka jiru namni beeku hin fakkaatu.
That's an idea.	Sun yaada.
Now this is the problem.	Amma rakkoon jiru kana.
He has your eyes.	Ija kee qaba.
Better leave it alone for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf kophaa isaa dhiisuu wayya.
Someone she knows.	Nama isheen beektu.
She had her life in them.	Jireenya ishee isaan keessa qabdi turte.
It's in there.	Achi keessa jira.
True.	Dhugaa.
It was more than that, of course.	Kana caalaa akka ture beekamaadha.
I always thought it was different.	Yeroo hundumaa adda natti fakkaata ture.
It doesn’t have to go that way.	Akkas deemuun dirqama miti.
I certainly knew him.	Ani akkan isa beeku beekamaadha.
Maybe they'll come around.	Tarii naannoo isaanii dhufuu danda'u.
He was doing a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjechaa ture.
I hope it doesn’t go away.	Akka hin deemne abdiin qaba.
I don't think this is true.	Kun dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu.
I think it's more.	Caalaatti natti fakkaata.
She certainly didn’t really want to see me.	Isheen dhuguma na arguu akka hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
I don't understand the reason for this.	Sababni kanaa naaf hin galle.
Everyone knows this much.	Hamma kana namni hundi ni beeka.
I don’t know how she did it.	Akkamitti akka goote hin beeku.
I might not even see him.	Silaa isa arguu illee dhiisuu danda'a.
It was a long long way.	Karaa dheeraa dheeraa ture.
But he was great.	Inni garuu guddaa ture.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa akka hin beekne dubbateera.
This was not a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii hin turre.
He only had to buy one drink so far.	Hanga ammaatti dhugaatii tokko qofa bitachuu qaba ture.
She was very young.	Baayyee xiqqoo turte.
I think that’s him.	Sun isa natti fakkaata.
He didn't say why, but the reason was obvious.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin dubbanne, garuu sababni isaa ifa ture.
The work loves that.	Hojiin sana ni jaallata.
Better not tell him anything.	Homaa itti hin himne wayya.
It would have been nice.	Silaa gaarii ture.
That would be excessive.	Sun garmalee ta'a.
I thought you were different.	Ati adda natti fakkaate.
If we want to be honest, we have to admit this.	Dhugaa dubbachuu yoo barbaanne kana amanuu qabna.
He knew it would happen.	Akka ta'u beeka ture.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammadeera.
I know you are definitely right.	Sirrii ta'uu kee hin oolu jedheen beeka.
You can join us!.	Nu waliin ta'uu dandeessu!.
Please go here.	Mee as deemaa.
There is nothing but you.	Si malee wanti biraa hin jiru.
I mean, maybe they will.	Tarii ni ta'u jechuu kooti.
I think we have a problem.	Akka waan rakkoo qabnu natti fakkaata.
I know it's early, but we have to go.	Dafee akka ta'e nan beeka, garuu deemuu qabna.
They won’t hold you anymore.	Kana booda sitti hin qaban.
I’d rather see something else.	Waan biraa arguu naaf wayya.
In both cases.	Haala lamaan keessatti.
Then I wasn't sure.	Sana booda mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
They shouldn’t do that.	Akkas gochuu hin qaban.
You know on some.	Tokko tokko irratti beekta.
Except he was still here.	Ammallee as ture malee.
That was a feeling he never thought he would have.	Sun miira inni gonkumaa qaba jedhee hin yaadne ture.
There's not much to them.	Waan baay'een isaan keessa hin jiru.
You know you can see a little bit.	Xiqqoo arguu dandeessu ni beekta.
I’m happy now.	Amma gammadeera.
Much shouldn't be in the way.	Baay'ee karaa keessa ta'uu hin qabu.
Still, that one time was enough.	Ammas yeroon tokko sun gahaa ture.
He loves to help.	Gargaaruu ni jaallata.
There was something in there.	Waan tokko achi keessa ture.
And I told him so.	Anis akkas itti hime.
That may be appropriate.	Sun sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
Something, someone was there with her.	Waan tokko, namni tokko ishee waliin achi ture.
I can't know anything about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa beekuu hin danda'u.
Husband and father.	Abbaa manaa fi abbaa.
I just couldn’t see her like that.	Akkasitti ishee arguu hin dandeenye qofa.
So it can be done.	Kanaaf gochuun ni danda'ama.
He couldn’t tell.	Inni beekuu hin dandeenye.
I don't know the girl.	Intala hin beeku.
She needs that.	Sana ishee barbaachisa.
Wait for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf eegaa.
He must have it.	Qabaachuu qaba.
I want one of them to help me.	Isaan keessaa isa na gargaaru nan barbaada.
Only one place.	Bakka tokko qofa.
We need to see them working together.	Waliin hojjechuu isaanii arguu qabna.
Just another accident.	Balaa kan biraa qofa.
You have to eat now.	Amma nyaachuu qabda.
He is not a human being.	Inni nama miti.
You have that kind of situation here.	Asitti haala akkasii qabda.
What do they want us to do?	Maal akka goonu barbaadu?
Luck was with me.	Carraan na waliin ture.
I really don’t understand.	Dhuguma naaf hin galle.
We have children.	Ijoollee qabna.
But in this case it didn’t matter.	Garuu haala kana keessatti homaa hin turre.
So we are in good hands.	Kanaaf harka gaarii keessa jirra.
There homework work extensive.	Achitti hojii manaa hojii bal'aa.
In this case.	Kana keessatti.
Something was wrong inside.	Keessatti wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
Everyone wanted it that way.	Namni hundi akkasitti barbaada ture.
He is not a morning person.	Inni nama ganama miti.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Now it was more than curiosity.	Amma fedhii beekuu caalaa ture.
But it’s not a job.	Garuu hojii miti.
They need help.	Gargaarsa isaan barbaachisa.
It was better than that.	Kana caalaa gaarii ture.
It was a huge disaster.	Balaa guddaa ture.
You have to be home.	Mana ta'uu qabda.
That’s really not so much.	Dhuguma sun hangas miti.
Times always look bad.	Yeroon yeroo hunda hamaa fakkaata.
Again, he loves it.	Ammas, ni jaallata.
Something was not right here.	Asitti wanti tokko sirrii hin turre.
That’s just how it worked.	Akkasitti qofa hojjete.
You know better than that.	Kana caalaa ati beekta.
He had the money.	Maallaqa qaba ture.
At that time.	Yeroo sana.
They say this happens sometimes.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko ni ta'a jedhu.
I think it's probably too late.	Tarii yeroon isaa darbe ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada.
I couldn’t do anything else.	Waan biraa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I can even see you up here.	Asitti ol illee si arguu danda'a.
You are my wife.	Ati haadha manaa kooti.
But this still can’t be right.	Garuu kun ammallee sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u.
It'll be a good one.	Kan gaarii ta'a.
Look someone in the eye.	Nama ija keessa ilaalaa.
This would never have happened.	Silaa kun gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
He said he used to be fine.	Duraan gaarii ture jedhe.
That was what you did.	Kan ati goote kanuma ture.
It's going to be long.	Dheeraa ta'uuf deema.
And that's it.	Ani kanuma.
You don’t think about it.	Ati hin yaaddu.
Everything is known to you.	Wanti hundi siif beeka.
But they don’t care.	Garuu isaan dhimma hin qaban.
Glad I found him.	Isa argachuu kootti gammadeera.
He knows there aren’t that many.	Hamma kana akka hin jirre ni beeka.
It’s time to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf yeroon isaa amma.
But that didn’t matter.	Garuu sun homaa hin turre.
I knew he meant that.	Akkas jechuu isaa nan beeka ture.
She’s not that important.	Isheen hangas barbaachisaa miti.
I always did that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas nan godha ture.
I went to my room.	Gara kutaa kootti deeme.
So tell me the truth.	Kanaaf dhugaa natti himi.
We need to get a new car.	Konkolaataa haaraa argachuu qabna.
He didn’t have an answer, but that didn’t matter.	Deebii hin qabu ture, garuu sun homaa hin qabu ture.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
I couldn’t see them.	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
He could have done it in his sleep.	Silaa hirriba isaa keessatti gochuu danda'a ture.
I didn't do anything!	Ani homaa hin goone!
I love you so much.	Baay'een si jaalladha.
Not a great feeling happening around here.	Miira guddaa naannoo asitti ta'aa jiru miti.
We have something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qabna.
We have that similar.	Sana wal fakkaatu qabna.
There is none of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
we can’t go.	deemuu hin dandeenyu.
love the guy.	jaalladhu.
That's a very good question.	Gaaffii baayyee gaarii dha.
It must be you.	Si ta'uu qaba.
He knew now.	Inni amma beeka ture.
We hold hands.	Harka wal qabna.
Nothing but friends.	Hiriyyoota malee homaa miti.
There is no other reason.	Sababni biraa hin jiru.
That was a long time ago.	Sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
They often went barefoot.	Yeroo baayyee kophee malee deemaa turan.
As he has done many times before.	Akkuma kanaan dura yeroo hedduu godhe.
It's all just her.	Hundi ishee qofa.
It is a place of date names.	Bakka maqaa guyyaa dha.
Some things will happen.	Wanti tokko tokko ni ta'a.
None of his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
We are very lucky.	Baay'ee carraa qabna.
You never knew.	Ati gonkumaa hin beekne.
She has something to say.	Waan isheen jedhu qaba.
Until her.	Hanga ishee.
You can’t live here without him.	Isa malee as jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
We went to work.	Hojii deemne.
No one else in the house likes them.	Mana keessa namni biraa isaan jaallatu hin jiru.
This person knows the past.	Namni kun waan darbe ni beeka.
Nothing else seemed big enough.	Wanti biraa guddaa gahaa hin fakkaatu ture.
He has many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qaba.
I loved doing a great amount.	Hamma guddaa hojjechuu nan jaalladha ture.
That’s all we do.	Hojii keenya kana qofa.
Which always happens.	Kan yeroo hunda ta'u.
But this doesn't work.	Kun garuu hin hojjetu.
Always.	Yeroo hunda.
I need to eat food.	Nyaata nyaachuu nan barbaachisa.
It was he who came out.	Kan ba'e isa ture.
Unless someone tells him.	Yoo namni itti hime malee.
He looked at the money again.	Ammas qarshii ilaale.
It is clear on the light.	Ifa irratti ifaadha.
Now he does that.	Amma akkas godha.
He wasn’t a man.	Nama hin turre ture.
I have this feeling he was excited.	Ani akka inni gammade miira kana qaba.
Someone else telling the truth.	Namni biraa dhugaa dubbachuu.
It wasn’t in his place.	Bakka isaa hin turre.
I had no idea what he thought of her.	Waa'ee ishee maal akka yaadu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
He looks just like the man.	Inni akkuma nama sana fakkaata.
With a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa waliin.
Similar to school.	Mana barumsaa wajjin wal fakkaata.
It has been around for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf kan ture.
We have to get it.	Argachuu qabna.
I don't know why it doesn't but it doesn't.	Maaliif akka hin taane hin beeku garuu hin ta'u.
Who knows what.	Maal eenyutu beeka.
It doesn’t go that way.	Akkasitti hin deemu.
He didn't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himne.
I never think about it that way.	Ani akkasitti waa'ee isaa gonkumaa hin yaadu.
Then he will do it.	Sana booda ni godha.
If you do, however, you’ll be in good hands.	Yoo akkas goote garuu harka gaarii keessa jirta.
Something they never did.	Waan isaan gonkumaa hin hojjenne.
But he couldn't do anything.	Garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
She’s been working on them for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan irratti hojjechaa turte.
It would have happened much, much sooner.	Silaa baay'ee, dafee ta'a ture.
Looks pretty much the same.	Baay'ee wal fakkaata fakkaata.
I hadn’t seen this one coming.	Inni kun dhufuu isaa hin argine ture.
What works for you, works for you.	Wanti siif hojjetu, siif hojjeta.
Do any of you know	Isin keessaa namni beektu jiraa .
Need some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko barbaachisa.
People need more friends, everyone needs more friends.	Namoonni hiriyyoota baay'ee barbaadu, namni hundi hiriyyoota baay'ee barbaada.
No problem.	Rakkoo hin qabu.
But one came out.	Tokko garuu ba'e.
Maybe there wasn't any time.	Tarii yeroon tokkollee hin turre ta'a.
Just my name.	Maqaa koo qofa.
Then you can go.	Sana booda deemuu dandeessa.
But it’s not exactly the same as eating each other.	Garuu wal nyaachuu wajjin sirriitti wal hin fakkaatu.
I won't do it again.	Ammas hin godhu.
I don't want to.	Ani hin barbaadu.
But really, that can't be a job.	Garuu dhuguma, sun hojii ta'uu hin danda'u.
It’s him.	Isa dha.
Everything was possible.	Wanti hundi ni danda'ama ture.
It seemed like it was.	Akka waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
He couldn't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin dandeenye.
But they can be.	Isaan garuu ta'uu danda'u.
He didn't say much.	Waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
I thought he had it.	Akka qabu natti fakkaate.
We have a daughter.	Intala tokko qabna.
I need some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
He wanted to talk more.	Caalaatti dubbachuu barbaade.
I wasn't entirely sure.	Guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
He should have known they were friends.	Silaa hiriyyoota ta'uu isaanii beekuu qaba ture.
They hadn’t seen it.	Isaan hin argine turan.
Two good years.	Waggaa gaarii lama.
Not until before, not even that.	Hanga dura miti, sana illee miti.
I'd rather go with you.	Si waliin deemuu naaf wayya.
I just don’t know how to do that.	Akkamitti akkas akka godhu qofa hin beeku.
Living here now.	Amma as jiraachuu.
Still, it really wasn't that simple.	Ammas ta'ee, dhuguma akkas salphaa hin turre.
I know where he is the whole time.	Yeroo guutuu eessa akka jiru nan beeka.
Nothing on the matter yet.	Dhimma kana irratti hanga ammaatti homaa hin jiru.
But she didn't want to.	Isheen garuu hin barbaanne.
There is no one outside.	Namni ala hin jiru.
He is in my place, he wants me.	Inni bakka kootti jira, na barbaada.
It’s working well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
But it’s my truth, isn’t it.	Garuu dhugaa kooti mitiiree.
I never have been, not really.	Ani ta'ee hin beeku, dhuguma miti.
There is no way, how.	Karaa hin qabu, akkamitti.
No one had seen her.	Namni ishee arge hin turre.
It will never be more than that.	Kana caalaa gonkumaa hin ta'u.
But with them, you don’t really know them.	Isaan waliin garuu dhuguma isaan hin beektu.
Maybe with this complete stranger.	Tarii nama guutummaatti hin beekne kana waliin ta'a.
About the dog thing.	Waa'ee waan saree.
He has something to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu qaba.
Something like a promise.	Waan akka waadaa.
He is a really good man.	Dhuguma nama gaarii dha.
It wouldn't be so bad tomorrow.	Boru akkas hamaa hin ta'u ture.
I didn’t intend to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf hin yaadne.
I enjoyed it.	Itti gammadeera.
She was the only one who didn’t.	Kan hin goone ishee qofa ture.
It was good though.	Gaarii ture garuu.
I knew him well enough.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka ture.
It didn’t seem real.	Waan dhugaa hin fakkaatu ture.
There’s really nothing else to this.	Dhuguma kana keessaa wanti biraa hin jiru.
We did it once.	Yeroo tokko hojjenne.
The reason why is unclear.	Sababni maaliif akka ta'e ifa miti.
He wanted to be clear.	Ifa ta'uu barbaade.
I know they have two children.	Ijoollee lama akka qaban nan beeka.
It's just what happened.	Waan ta'e qofa.
This was not one.	Kun tokko hin turre.
So that's what happened.	Kanaaf kan ta'e kanuma.
This was it, this was his big chance.	Kun ture, kun carraa isaa guddaa ture.
That was really nice.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola ture.
It was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture.
But it is a must.	Garuu dirqama.
I'm waiting.	Ani eegaa jira.
Maybe it will happen again.	Tarii ammas ta'uu danda'a.
It’s not who we were.	Nuti eenyu akka turre miti.
Not now, she said, not ever.	Amma miti, yoomiyyuu miti jette.
It can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u.
I couldn't find it.	Argachuu hin dandeenye.
It didn’t seem important.	Barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu ture.
He loves us together.	Waliin nu jaalladha.
Everyone.	Nama hundumaa.
But she didn't see it.	Isheen garuu hin argine.
I can't do anything wrong.	Waan hamaa hojjechuu hin danda'u.
He thought quickly.	Dafee yaade.
Your biggest mistake.	Dogoggora kee isa guddaa.
It was all going to be for the best.	Hundi isaa waan gaarii ta'uuf ture.
There was nothing here.	Asitti homaa hin turre.
You were very helpful.	Gargaarsa guddaa qabda turte.
I was waiting, too.	Anis eegaa ture.
But the buyer revealed very little.	Garuu namni bite kun baayyee xiqqoo ifa godhe.
That’s how he made money.	Akkasitti maallaqa argate.
It's mine.	Kan kooti.
He doesn't like it.	Inni hin jaallatu.
It still looks good.	Ammas gaarii fakkaata.
She was different.	Isheen adda turte.
You’re just in my way.	Ati karaa koo qofa jirta.
I don't know what could have happened.	Waan ta'uu danda'u hin beeku.
But she had to give him another chance.	Garuu carraa biraa isaaf kennuu qabdi turte.
He wanted to quit his job.	Hojii isaa dhiisuu barbaade.
This was a job.	Kun hojii ture.
Sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko.
But you often don't have time to do this.	Garuu yeroo baay'ee kana gochuuf yeroo hin qabdu.
Drink the real drink.	Dhugaatii dhugaa.
I have a lot of things.	Waan baay'een qaba.
But now was not the time.	Amma garuu yeroon isaa hin turre.
It was my everything.	Waan hundumaa koo ture.
That you can be whoever you want to be.	Nama ta'uu barbaaddu ta'uu akka dandeessu.
Please wait for me here.	Mee asitti na eegaa.
Sometimes that’s the case.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas ta’a.
Maybe he didn't.	Tarii hin goone ta'a.
What it is and what it does.	Maal akka ta’ee fi maal akka hojjetu.
I don't understand how this could happen.	Kun akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u naaf hin galle.
They were here for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf as turan.
They can see something like that.	Waan akkasii arguu danda'u.
One of us will be.	Tokko keenya ni ta'a.
I hope this is the case.	Kun akkas akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
If that works.	Yoo sun hojjete.
We are still waiting on that.	Sana irratti ammallee eegaa jirra.
It’s just very dangerous.	Baayyee balaa qofa qaba.
Now he was a different person.	Amma nama adda ture.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
You have to be optimistic, apparently.	Abdii qabaachuu qabda, fakkaata.
Always, but what should this do.	Yeroo hunda, garuu kun maal gochuu qaba.
It was a great book.	Kitaaba guddaa ture.
She is one, the answer.	Isheen tokko, deebii.
Right and wrong.	Sirrii fi dogoggora.
He obviously didn’t know where he was.	Bakka jiru akka hin beekne ifaadha.
He watched me come towards him.	Gara isaa akkan dhufu ilaale.
None of them seemed interested in him.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan isaaf fedhii qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
This can do it.	Kun gochuu danda'a.
I don't come here very often.	Yeroo baay'ee as hin dhufu.
You better believe it.	Ati amanuu wayya.
No one does that.	Namni akkas godhu hin jiru.
He’s been here a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa as ture.
But not like this one.	Garuu akka isa kanaa miti.
That's where it was.	Bakka ture sana.
I don't know why this is.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
But we can't and.	Garuu hin dandeenyu fi.
Then a month later.	Sana booda ji'a tokko.
Maybe just a few.	Tarii muraasa qofa ta'uu danda'a.
It’s not really an issue.	Dhuguma dhimma miti.
But if you do that .	Garuu yoo akkas goote .
he asked me, smirking.	jedhee na gaafate.
Maybe it's different.	Tarii adda ta'uu danda'a.
Why, he wasn't sure.	Maaliif, mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
There's a lot going on.	Waan baay'een keessa deemaa jira.
That’s not my issue.	Sun dhimma koo miti.
It works very well to be just that.	Kana qofa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
We were friends.	Hiriyyoota turre.
Then he realized.	Sana booda hubate.
Exactly this situation.	Sirriitti haala kana.
We weren’t the only ones.	Nuti qofa hin taane.
It’s not that big of a deal.	Waan guddaa akkasii miti.
Who knows.	Eenyutu beeka.
I hope you make it great.	Guddaa akka gootu abdiin qaba.
I love them both together.	Lamaan isaanii waliin nan jaalladha.
But that may come later.	Sun garuu booda dhufuu dandaʼa.
He just looked around inside.	Keessatti naannoo isaa ilaale qofa.
She's the one.	Isheen ishee.
But they were there.	Garuu isaan achi turan.
I'm not interested.	Ani fedhii hin qabu.
She hadn't quite understood.	Isheen guutummaatti hin hubanne turte.
I could not find the reason for this.	Sababa kanaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
She still didn't even know her name.	Ammas maqaa ishee illee hin beektu turte.
He wasn’t good enough.	Inni gaarii hin turre.
Simple but excellent.	Salphaa garuu baayyee gaarii dha.
She was very much one with them.	Isaan waliin baayyee tokko turte.
It was his job.	Hojii isaa ture.
You know, just like my wife.	Beektaa akkuma haadha manaa kooti.
He is in a bad way.	Inni karaa hamaa keessa jira.
Time passed quickly.	Yeroon dafee darbe.
Maybe something will really happen tonight.	Tarii halkan kana dhuguma wanti tokko ni ta'a.
Always worked well until recently.	Yeroo hunda hanga yeroo dhiyootti gaarii hojjete.
They are the only ones.	Isaan qofa.
You have the absolute truth and nothing but the truth about that.	Dhugaa guutuu qabda sana irratti dhugaa malee homaa hin qabdu.
Except from me.	Ana irraa malee.
He was lucky though.	Carraa qaba ture garuu.
No one does it.	Namni godhu hin jiru.
I didn't want trouble.	Rakkoo hin barbaanne.
She should know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qabdi.
I have no idea how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu.
So he may not be very interested.	Kanaaf fedhii guddaa qabaachuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
That is what one does.	Namni tokko kanuma godha.
Not that he was looking for it.	Inni barbaadaa ture jechuu miti.
After a while he looked up.	Yeroo muraasa booda ol jedhee ilaale.
I wasn’t expecting him at all.	Tasumaa isa eegaa hin turre.
From another place.	Bakka biraa irraa.
It was one of these weeks.	Torban kana keessaa tokko ture.
He was going to make a great guy.	Gurbaa guddaa hojjechuuf ture.
I saw a lot of things.	Waan baay'een arge.
He didn't think about it.	Homaa itti hin yaadne.
I don't know if that's true anymore.	Kana booda sun dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
I'm pretty good at that.	Ani sana irratti baayyee ga'umsa qaba.
It worked really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjete.
This is a new house.	Kun mana haaraa dha.
He saw us.	Nu arge.
With that one guy.	Gurbaa tokko sana waliin.
You said that	Ati akkas jette .
You are still working.	Ammas hojjechaa jirta.
But it was better not to.	Garuu osoo hin taane wayya ture.
I know these things.	Wantoota kana nan beeka.
Now a lot was inevitable.	Amma waan baay'een waan hin oolle ture.
He had a great sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa guddaa qaba ture.
I didn't think much of it.	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
I don’t know what he saw in her.	Waan inni ishee keessatti arge hin beeku.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Waan guddaa hin turre.
Again, real life stuff here.	Ammas, wantoota jireenya dhugaa asitti.
You don't want the truth.	Dhugaa hin barbaaddu.
I wondered if you knew of a way.	Karaa tokko beektaa jedheen yaade.
I just don’t understand it.	Naaf hin galle qofa.
I do that a lot.	Ani baay'een akkas godha.
He is not the dangerous one here.	Inni asitti kan balaa qabu miti.
It was so good.	Akkas gaarii ture.
He is at work in you.	Hojii si keessa hojjechaa jira.
I must be one.	Ani tokko ta'uu qaba.
No one who knew me was watching.	Namni na beeku ilaalaa hin turre.
I came to her, too.	Anis gara ishee dhufe.
But he didn't do that.	Garuu akkas hin goone.
Not much, it seemed.	Baay'ee miti, fakkaata ture.
It's probably around here.	Asitti naannoo ta'uu hin oolu.
They are right.	Isaan sirrii dha.
He didn't do it now.	Amma hin goone.
I think about that a lot.	Sana baay'een yaada.
I really, really did.	Dhuguma, dhuguma nan godhe.
He knew photography.	Suuraa ni beeka ture.
They couldn’t believe their eyes.	Ija isaanii amanuu hin dandeenye.
I just don’t understand why she would want to do that.	Maaliif akkas gochuu akka barbaaddu qofa naaf hin galle.
This is not the case.	Kun akkas miti.
I can't do anything about her.	Waa'ee ishee homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
It was just what was needed.	Waan barbaachisu qofa ture.
It really looked great on her.	Dhuguma ishee irratti baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
It is completely wrong.	Guutummaatti dogoggora.
That doesn’t mean they don’t matter.	Kana jechuun dhimma hin qaban jechuu miti.
I couldn't stay here if she was right.	Osoo isheen sirrii taate as turuu hin danda'u ture.
They love their children very much.	Ijoollee isaanii baayyee jaallatu.
He’s right, of course.	Inni sirrii dha, beekamaadha.
Locals know he doesn’t have a good sense of humour.	Miira qoosaa gaarii akka hin qabne namoonni naannoo sanaa ni beeku.
They don't have to be right about anything else.	Waa'ee waan biraa sirrii ta'uu hin qaban.
They love to eat there.	Achitti nyaachuu ni jaallatu.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
But that's what happened.	Kan ta'e garuu kanuma.
I am new to this.	Ani kana irratti haaraa dha.
Still for hours.	Ammas sa'aatii dheeraaf.
Maybe even leave him.	Tarii illee isa dhiisuu danda'a.
I knew that what we had was special.	Wanti qabnu adda akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
We have a promise now.	Waadaa amma qabna.
Who knows why we are so late.	Maaliif akkasitti booda jiraachuu keenya eenyutu beeka.
No one knows how many.	Meeqa meeqa kan beeku hin jiru.
He went up to him.	Gara isaatti ol ba'e.
That would never, ever happen today.	Sun har’a gonkumaa, gonkumaa hin ta’u ture.
It must be unique.	Adda ta’uu qaba.
In the night.	Halkan keessa.
You don’t love me anymore.	Kana booda na hin jaallattu.
He was our father.	Inni abbaa keenya ture.
He wants that for me.	Sana naaf barbaada.
Maybe it's enough.	Tarii gahaa ta'uu danda'a.
Afterwards .	Sana booda .
I never knew who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
He may know something that can help you.	Waan si gargaaruu dandaʼu beekuu dandaʼa.
He was very good.	Inni baayyee gaarii ture.
I could have been there with him.	Silaa isa waliin achi jiraachuu danda'a ture.
This was a great positive response.	Kun deebii gaarii guddaa ture.
They go to it.	Itti deemu.
The job involves risk.	Hojiin sun balaa of keessaa qaba.
In some cases this may be sufficient.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti kun gahaa ta’uu danda’a.
It’s not his question.	Gaaffii isaa miti.
Where is that? 	Eessa jira sun?
But who needs it.	Garuu eenyutu barbaachisa.
She was already like them.	Isheen duruu akkuma isaanii turte.
It sounds bad, but it’s not.	Hamaa fakkaata, garuu akkas miti.
He couldn’t see it.	Inni arguu hin dandeenye ture.
But she hesitated for a moment.	Isheen garuu yeroo muraasaaf duubatti jette.
It still looks pretty good.	Ammallee baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
He wanted to give it time.	Yeroo kennuu barbaade.
I don't know anything else.	Waan biraa hin beeku.
Better buy two.	Lama bitachuu wayya.
He was hopelessly helpless.	Gargaarsa abdii malee ture.
You should know this.	Kana beekuu qabdu.
Then there were the people.	Sana booda namoonni achi turan.
What does it look like.	Maal fakkaata.
He could work with that.	Sana waliin hojjechuu danda'a ture.
Only, something went wrong.	Qofa, wanti tokko dogoggora ta'e.
But it is not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti.
In this way.	Haala kanaan.
You know about my real parents.	Waa'ee warra koo isa dhugaa ni beekta.
If people do nothing, nothing happens.	Yoo namoonni homaa hin goone wanti ta'u hin jiru.
You can find a lot here.	Baay'ee as irraa argachuu dandeessu.
No one would ever do that.	Namni gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
I'm not entirely sure why that is.	Maaliif akkas akka ta'e guutummaatti hin beeku.
He thought of his children.	Ijoollee isaa yaade.
It’s not real life.	Jireenya dhugaa miti.
It was just him.	Isa qofa ture.
Everything has been fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee jira.
I wouldn't be here otherwise.	Osoo akkas ta'ee as hin jiru ture.
It turned out very well.	Baay'ee gaarii ta'e.
He is there now.	Amma achi jira.
But three times.	Garuu yeroo sadii.
They are making mistakes.	Dogoggora hojjechaa jiru.
I have a lot of stuff to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu baay'een qaba.
I was looking for you.	Si barbaadaa ture.
But that is not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas miti.
You could have given him time.	Silaa yeroo isaaf kennuu dandeessa turte.
If that happens, the day's work contains it though.	Yoo sun ta'e hojiin guyyaa sana of keessaa qaba garuu.
Then I looked at it for a long time.	Sana booda yeroo dheeraaf ilaale.
I don't think it's a chance but it could happen.	Carraa natti hin fakkaatu garuu ta'uu danda'a.
Same question, same answer.	Gaaffii wal fakkaatu, deebii wal fakkaatu.
I came here yesterday	Kaleessa as dhufe
Not much luck going to it.	Carraa baay'ee itti hin deemu.
Maybe you don't know that.	Tarii ati kana hin beektu ta'a.
She wouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas hin gootu turte.
It was night at the time.	Yeroo sanatti halkan ture.
But he is in trouble.	Garuu rakkoo keessa jira.
So, we did it.	Kanaaf, hojjenne.
I knew it was only a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
That's the one.	Isa sana.
Sometimes it happens like this.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkasitti ta'a.
A couple of things.	Waan tokko lama.
I won't say it anymore.	Kana booda hin jedhu.
He wanted to know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaade.
I'm so sorry.	Baay'een dhiifama.
It has a room.	Kutaa qaba.
It’s not for us.	Nuuf miti.
Which is totally possible.	Kan guutummaatti ta'uu danda'u.
I would much rather be alone.	Kophaa koo jiraachuu baayʼee naaf wayya.
Join us today!.	Har'a nu waliin ta'aa!.
I don’t have a chance.	Carraa hin qabu.
This is just such a situation.	Kun haala akkasii qofa.
Didn't think that would be a problem.	Sun rakkoo ta'a jedhee hin yaadne.
Just like you think.	Akkuma ati yaaddu.
One was never sure.	Namni gonkumaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
A good episode.	Kutaa gaarii.
They had to go home.	Gara manaatti deebi'uu qabu turan.
It's something new.	Waan haaraa ta'e.
It was obvious he was looking for me.	Na barbaadaa akka ture ifa ture.
I think that's it.	Kanuma natti fakkaata.
But her work was excellent.	Garuu hojiin ishee baayyee gaarii ture.
You would have needed it.	Silaa si barbaachisa ture.
This worked great for us.	Kun waan guddaa nuuf hojjete.
I couldn’t stay here long.	Yeroo dheeraa as turuu hin dandeenye.
But he was an important man.	Garuu nama barbaachisaa ture.
That would have been better.	Sun wayya ture.
Wait, that’s not right.	Eegaa, sun sirrii miti.
It is an important book.	Kitaaba barbaachisaa dha.
I think more that no one else can.	Caalaatti kan namni biraa hin dandeenye nan yaada.
I still have my voice.	Ammas sagalee koo qaba.
It will still take time.	Ammas yeroo ni barbaachisa.
Is he with friends?	Hiriyyoota waliin jiraa?
But, that hasn’t happened yet.	Garuu, sun hanga ammaatti hin taane.
Never, never, never.	Gonkumaa, gonkumaa, gonkumaa.
I hope that turns out to be true.	Sun dhugaa akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
Look at us now.	Amma nu ilaalaa.
He was in that situation.	Haala sana keessa ture.
You don’t know who you are.	Eenyu akka taate hin beektu.
That’s not it.	Kana miti.
He was in a state of mind.	Haala yaada keessa ture.
No one could see me there.	Namni achitti na arguu hin dandeenye.
I thought it was pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate.
Then he spoke.	Sana booda dubbate.
Now to my question.	Amma gara gaaffii kootti.
Just like we did.	Akkuma nuti goone.
This is looking at both of us.	Kun lamaan keenya iyyuu ilaalaa jira.
I love you so much.	Baay'een si jaalladha.
This man had a daughter.	Namni kun intala tokko qaba ture.
It can still work.	Ammas hojjechuu danda'a.
He knew this place well.	Bakka kana sirriitti beeka ture.
This is my place, more.	Kun bakka kooti, ​​caalaatti.
He didn’t know what to do to help.	Gargaaruuf maal gochuu akka qabu hin beeku ture.
But no one else did.	Garuu namni biraa hin goone.
But they weren’t there.	Garuu isaan achi hin turre.
I don't know how to do it can you help.	Akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku gargaaruu dandeessaa.
Maybe they should have.	Tarii qabaachuu qabu ta'a.
This is what happens.	Kan ta'u kana.
We wanted to be with you.	Si waliin ta'uu barbaanne.
I wanted him to know my friends.	Hiriyyoota koo akka beeku nan barbaada ture.
Otherwise it's doing just fine.	Yoo kana hin taane gaarii qofa hojjechaa jira.
But of course.	Garuu beekamaadha.
This time for sure.	Yeroo kana mirkanaa'aa dha.
He was always with us.	Yeroo hundumaa nu waliin ture.
He already suspects you.	Inni duruu si shakka.
He was obviously great at what he did.	Waan hojjete irratti guddaa akka ture ifaadha.
We obviously have some work to do.	Hojii tokko tokko akka qabnu ifaadha.
They could have done that.	Kana gochuu dandaʼu turan.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
Then he looked closely.	Sana booda sirriitti ilaale.
We are the good ones.	Nuti warra gaarii dha.
No one is coming.	Namni hin dhufu.
Or is she?.	Moo isheen?.
This is also going to them.	Kun illee isaan deemaa jira.
He was still looking at her.	Ammallee ishee ilaalaa ture.
I really didn’t know what to tell him.	Dhuguma maal akkan itti himu hin beeku ture.
Something I certainly don't want to repeat again.	Waan ammas irra deebi'uu hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
That will never happen.	Sun yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
Now it was that day.	Amma guyyaa sana ture.
None need exist.	Tokkollee jiraachuu hin barbaachisu.
You should see him with his kids.	Ijoollee isaa waliin isa arguu qabda.
It did, to some extent.	Ni godhe, hamma tokko.
From another.	Kan biraa irraa.
This would have been a great episode.	Silaa kun kutaa guddaa ta'a ture.
You should have some of your own.	Kan kee keessaa muraasa qabaachuu qabda.
She really got me going.	Dhuguma akkan deemu na goote.
I would love to know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e beekuu nan jaalladha.
It seemed to work well.	Akka gaariitti waan hojjetu fakkaata ture.
Then, he gave me a question instead.	Sana booda, bakka isaa gaaffii naaf kenne.
Not me, really.	Ani miti, dhuguma.
But it's probably not.	Garuu ta'uu hin oolu.
Of all the things I no longer have in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti waan kana booda hin qabne hundumaa keessaa.
I’m not going for his vote.	Ani sagalee isaaf hin deemu.
It would have worked.	Silaa ni hojjeta ture.
It looks good to me.	Natti gaarii fakkaata.
What took you so long?	Maaltu yeroo dheeraa sitti fudhate?
It just had to be.	Ta'uu qofa qaba ture.
She is a great mother.	Haadha guddaa dha.
By doing this.	Kana gochuudhaan.
I don’t need this.	Kana na hin barbaachisu.
I can tell you that much right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana hamma sana sitti himuu nan danda'a.
You don’t want to help my career.	Hojii koo gargaaruu hin barbaaddu.
He’s right there.	Inni sirriitti achi jira.
The language is very clear.	Afaan baay'ee ifaadha.
She was a teacher.	Barsiisaa turte.
I would never have thought about it.	Silaa gonkumaa itti hin yaadne ture.
I can't do any better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu hin danda'u.
I can't with her.	Ishee waliin hin danda'u.
They always look so good.	Yeroo hundumaa akka malee gaarii fakkaatu.
To a great extent nothing happened.	Hamma guddaa homaa hin taane.
I don't know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
But it doesn't happen anymore.	Garuu kana booda hin ta'u.
Look at this issue.	Dhimma kana ilaalaa.
It would never have occurred to me.	Silaa gonkumaa natti hin dhufu ture.
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
he says.	jedha.
Maybe he can.	Tarii ni danda'a.
If so, it's a good idea.	Yoo akkas ta'e yaada gaarii dha.
This was a non-voice.	Kun sagalee hin taane ture.
I don’t mean good.	Gaarii jechuu koo miti.
I don't know why but he is there.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku garuu inni jira.
We like it good here.	Asitti gaarii nutti tola.
That they don’t have it.	Akka hin qabne.
Whatever happens, it happens.	Maaltu ta'a, ni ta'a.
No one ever said he looked like my father.	Namni abbaa koo fakkaata jedhee hin beeku.
You don’t need it.	Si hin barbaachisu.
You can’t go anywhere else.	Bakka biraa deemuu hin dandeessu.
A stranger, never been there, just left.	Nama hin beekne, achi turee hin beeku, qofa deeme.
Maybe a little bit of both.	Tarii xiqqoo lamaan isaanii ta'uu danda'a.
It's never really been easy.	Dhuguma salphaa ta'ee hin beeku.
The problem is, you don’t.	Rakkoon jiru, ati hin qabdu.
But she had nothing in common with him.	Isheen garuu waan isa waliin wal fakkaatu hin qabdu turte.
That would have been plenty at the time.	Yeroo sanatti sun baay'ee ta'a ture.
He was the only one who knew it was real.	Inni dhugaa ta'uu isaa kan beeku isa qofa ture.
It's just good.	Gaarii qofa.
This is not a good job.	Kun hojii gaarii miti.
Look at this big picture.	Suuraa guddaa kana ilaalaa.
But she wouldn't go.	Isheen garuu hin deemtu turte.
But nothing worked.	Garuu wanti hojjete hin jiru.
We weren’t the only ones.	Nu qofa hin turre.
I really do.	Dhuguma nan godha.
It was just as good.	Akkuma gaarii ture.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
But he wouldn’t have told anyone.	Garuu silaa namatti hin himu ture.
Now you have to do something about it.	Amma waa'ee isaa waan tokko gochuu qabda.
Not even for you to know who.	Eenyu akka beektu siif illee miti.
You know the way.	Karaa ni beekta.
It doesn't need to be just yet.	Amma qofa ta'uu hin barbaachisu.
We had that idea.	Yaada sana qabna turre.
This is just another issue.	Kun dhimma biraa qofa.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
But, of course, she said nothing of the sort.	Garuu, beekamaadha, isheen waan akkasii hin dubbanne.
You need two simple things.	Wantoota salphaa lama si barbaachisa.
I can’t seem to do anything.	Homaa hojjechuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
Not sure if it works.	Hojjechuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I thought he did that.	Inni akkas godhe natti fakkaate.
It works a lot.	Baayyee hojjeta.
Does it sound good?.	Sagalee gaarii dha?.
It’s really something.	Dhuguma waan tokko.
Who is the new one.	Eenyu inni haaraa.
Seeing people.	Namoota arguu.
I don’t want you here.	Asitti si hin barbaadu.
My mother and my father.	Haadha koo fi abbaa koo.
We can’t stay here.	As turuu hin dandeenyu.
Every day after work.	Guyyaa hunda hojii booda.
I was no different.	Ani adda hin turre.
We can't know what will happen.	Waan ta'u beekuu hin dandeenyu.
He has a great hand.	Harka guddaa qaba.
A little different.	Xiqqoo adda.
She was exactly where she belonged.	Isheen sirriitti bakka isheen qabdu turte.
This seems good.	Kun gaarii fakkaata.
But it was.	Garuu ni ture.
He and a few of his friends.	Inni fi hiriyyoota isaa muraasa.
It's going to happen soon.	Dafee ta'uuf jira.
I am always there.	Ani yeroo hundumaa jira.
But, after that.	Garuu, sana booda.
We have plenty of time.	Yeroo baay'ee qabna.
But nobody really knows.	Garuu dhuguma namni beeku hin jiru.
They look pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaatu.
She had something.	Waan tokko qabdi turte.
They love new homes.	Mana haaraa ni jaallatu.
He realized that was a possibility.	Sun taʼuu akka dandaʼu hubate.
You can just live.	Jiraachuu qofa dandeessa.
But it obviously was.	Garuu akka ture ifaadha.
she said.	jette.
Neither of us spoke.	Lamaan keenyayyuu hin dubbanne.
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	Kophaa ta'uu akka hin barbaanne qofa beeka ture.
That meant a lot.	Kana jechuun waan baay’ee jechuu ture.
He didn't do anything.	Waan tokkollee hin goone.
But you can't.	Garuu hin dandeessu.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I have nothing in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti homaa hin qabu.
After yesterday	Kaleessa booda .
I don't know why, but we did.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu ni goone.
It was in the eyes.	Ija keessa ture.
He saw what it was.	Maal akka ta'e arge.
This is your problem.	Kun rakkoo keessan.
I love everything about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa nan jaalladha.
So there is nothing else.	Kanaaf wanti biraa hin jiru.
We went to school together.	Mana barumsaa waliin deemne.
We didn’t do our job.	Hojii keenya hin hojjenne.
You must stay here with us.	Asitti nu bira turuu qabda.
He worked alone.	Inni kophaa isaa hojjete.
But look at this.	Garuu kana ilaalaa.
You know this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekta.
It works very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
You know his name.	Maqaa isaa ni beekta.
He was not in any danger.	Balaa tokkollee keessa hin turre.
I love this episode.	Kutaa kana baay'een jaalladha.
Do you know where this was?	Kun eessa akka ture beektaa?
This used to work fine.	Kun duraan gaarii hojjechaa ture.
We all have one.	Hundi keenya tokko qabna.
We couldn’t do that.	Nuti akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe it's as simple as that.	Tarii akkuma sanaa salphaa ta'uu danda'a.
You need a good pair of shoes.	Kophee gaarii si barbaachisa.
I didn’t see the things I wanted to see.	Wantoota arguu barbaade hin argine.
That wasn’t good enough.	Sun gaarii hin turre.
It has its place.	Bakka isaa qaba.
I never think of him.	Ani gonkumaa isa hin yaadu.
He knew that wasn't right but he couldn't help himself.	Sun sirrii akka hin taane beeka ture garuu of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
But that's really how it happened.	Garuu dhuguma akkas ta'e.
The chores were very easy.	Hojiin manaa baayʼee salphaa ture.
Then we just have to see .	Sana booda arguu qofa qabna .
They are in the area.	Isaan naannoo sana jiru.
He eats well, but talks little.	Nyaata gaarii nyaata, garuu xiqqoo dubbata.
There is no probable cause.	Sababni ta'uu danda'u hin jiru.
It wants to be something.	Waan tokko ta'uu barbaada.
This was just too much.	Kun garmalee qofa ture.
Everyone does it, most of the time.	Namni hundi ni godha, yeroo baay'ee.
No one really looks different.	Dhuguma namni adda fakkaatu hin jiru.
But there you have it.	Garuu achitti qabda.
We did it for him.	Isa hojjenne.
It was very bad.	Baayyee hamaa ture.
He needed a life.	Jireenya isa barbaachisa ture.
Maybe it's not so bad.	Tarii akkas hamaa miti ta'a.
But that’s wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora.
I couldn’t find her.	Ishee argachuu hin dandeenye.
But it was never mine.	Garuu gonkumaa kan koo hin turre.
I can work on it.	Irratti hojjechuu nan danda'a.
Can anyone help please???.	Namni gargaaru jiraa maaloo???.
But it seemed real.	Garuu dhugaa fakkaata ture.
So far it’s doing really well.	Hanga ammaatti dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jira.
It never works.	Yoomiyyuu hin hojjetu.
She didn't know if that was still true or not.	Sun ammallee dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beektu turte.
But it’s not good.	Garuu gaarii miti.
Just not now.	Amma miti qofa.
You were the one.	Ati turte.
Some people have it.	Namoonni tokko tokko qabu.
So we’re looking at it.	Kanaaf ilaalaa jirra.
You need this.	Kana si barbaachisa.
It would have been much easier.	Silaa baayyee salphaa ture.
Neither of us spoke for a while.	Lamaan keenyayyuu yeroo muraasaaf hin dubbanne.
Maybe a long time ago.	Tarii yeroo dheeraa dura ta'uu danda'a.
I think you were right about that.	Waa'ee kanaa sirrii turte natti fakkaata.
It was really great.	Dhuguma guddaa ture.
She had to leave at some point.	Yeroo tokko deemuun ishee irra ture.
A lot of it is good.	Baay'een isaa gaarii dha.
Many of them do.	Baay'een isaanii ni godhu.
It goes with everything.	Waan hundumaa waliin deema.
When she leaves.	Yeroo isheen deemtu.
He should know.	Beekuu qaba.
This was terrible.	Kun hamaa ture.
They are among them	Isaan keessaa .
She has very broad interests.	Fedhii baayyee bal'aa qabdi.
Maybe you know him.	Tarii isa beektu ta'a.
I don’t love him anymore.	Kana booda isa hin jaalladhu.
Tell me what you were doing today.	Har'a maal hojjechaa akka turte natti himi.
She had a life.	Jireenya qabdi turte.
That’s a mistake.	Sun dogoggora.
It’s a good fact.	Dhugaa gaarii dha.
It has a good one.	Gaarii qaba.
We have enough of our own.	Kan keenya gahaa qabna.
I wasn’t there.	Ani achi hin turre.
I want you to do it.	Akka ati gootu nan barbaada.
It’s not just kids.	Ijoollee qofa miti.
You will love them.	Isaan ni jaallattu.
I didn’t know him.	Isa hin beeku ture.
I know it was.	Akka ture nan beeka.
Which they definitely do.	Kan isaan gochuun isaanii hin oolu.
No chance of me being that good.	Carraan koo akkas gaarii ta'uu danda'u hin jiru.
No one tried it.	Namni yaale hin jiru.
I hope someone has something.	Namni tokko waan tokko akka qabu abdiin qaba.
You don’t have it, you don’t have time.	Hin qabdu, yeroo hin qabdu.
It wasn’t my dog.	Saree koo hin turre.
I am not like you.	Ani akka kee miti.
In this case.	Haala kana keessatti.
Who is this person?	Namni kun eenyu?
But.	Garuu.
Work is going well.	Hojiin akka gaariitti deemaa jira.
So far everything works.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi ni hojjeta.
Sometimes she was in serious danger.	Yeroo tokko tokko balaa hamaa keessa turte.
I couldn’t stop seeing them.	Isaan arguu dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
Then he thought of something else.	Sana booda waan biraa yaade.
I love you so much.	Baay'een isin jaalladha.
He can't see me.	Na arguu hin danda'u.
They want us now.	Amma nu barbaadu.
It wouldn't be.	Hin ta'u ture.
She said I should go.	Ani deemuu qaba jette.
Just like you are.	Akkuma ati jirtu.
A terrible mistake.	Dogoggora hamaa.
I can see him.	Isa arguu danda'a.
Within a month.	Ji'a tokko keessatti.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
I want you to know that you are not alone.	Ati kophaa kee akka hin taane akka beektu nan barbaada.
I would never have.	Silaa gonkumaa hin qabu ture.
I thought you loved me.	Akka ati na jaallattu natti fakkaate.
But they’re not just people.	Garuu isaan namoota qofa miti.
I thought of the house.	Anis mana sana yaade.
Without ever telling him.	Osoo gonkumaa itti hin himne.
He stared at her for a very long time.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraaf ija keessa ishee ilaale.
I really hope you are right.	Dhuguma akka ati sirrii ta'e abdiin qaba.
Two hours every morning.	Ganama ganama sa'aatii lama.
But it went further.	Garuu kana caalaa deeme.
I can truly see your father in you.	Dhuguma abbaa kee si keessaa arguu nan danda'a.
From the house.	Mana irraa.
He wanted her.	Ishee barbaade.
It was an important moment.	Yeroon sun yeroo barbaachisaa ture.
He was not in any danger.	Balaa tokkollee keessa hin turre.
We need to find her.	Ishee argachuu qabna.
If only everything went well.	Osoo wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deeme.
People want the real thing.	Namoonni waan dhugaa barbaadu.
It wouldn't be needed here.	Silaa asitti hin barbaachisu ture.
I wondered what was going on.	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen yaade.
He saw that he loved her.	Akka ishee jaallatu arge.
But there was no time.	Garuu yeroon hin turre.
Not yet, not quite.	Ammallee miti, guutummaatti miti.
It was hers now.	Amma kan ishee ture.
But wait a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasa eegaa.
Maybe it didn't happen that way.	Tarii akkasitti hin taane ta'a.
You are my light.	Ati ifa kooti.
What was it.	Maal ture.
Just like you were.	Akkuma ati turte.
Of course, not quite like you did.	Akka ati goote guutummaatti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I didn’t want to see it.	Ani arguu hin barbaanne.
You will never have to do that.	Yoomiyyuu akkas gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
I think it’s a boy thing.	Waan gurbaa natti fakkaata.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
What should you do?	Maal gochuu qabda?
Your name is.	Maqaa kee.
Not everyone is as lucky.	Namni hundi akka carraa hin qabu.
I'm very nice to you.	Baay'een sitti tola.
We told the truth, though.	Dhugaa dubbanne garuu.
I don't have any answers.	Deebii tokkollee hin qabu.
That’s not entirely good.	Sun guutummaatti gaarii miti.
We have to do all the work.	Hojii hunda hojjechuu qabna.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
Today was different.	Har'a adda ture.
I have a few friends.	Hiriyyoota muraasa qaba.
Thus, it is.	Akkasitti.
One of the many.	Baay'ee keessaa tokko.
I knew it would all happen.	Hundi akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
Then he got out of the car.	Sana booda konkolaataa keessaa ba'e.
He knows, they know.	Inni ni beeka, isaan ni beeku.
Again, not entirely true.	Ammas, guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
Still nothing happened.	Ammas wanti ta'e hin jiru.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
I was late too.	Anis yeroon booda ture.
You have the right idea.	Yaada sirrii qabda.
But it will be here soon enough.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti as ni ta'a.
There is no question and answer before it.	Isa dura gaaffii fi deebii hin jiru.
But it’s there.	Garuu achi jira.
It was very important.	Baay'ee barbaachisaa ture.
What we promised.	Waan waadaa galle.
It was very simple.	Baayyee salphaa ture.
This is my job.	Kun hojii kooti.
It was just an accident.	Balaa qofa ture.
I wasn't sure how it would work.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
This is not exactly true.	Kun sirriitti dhugaa miti.
He would not have been there.	Silaa achi hin jiru ture.
It's a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii dha.
They know each other very well.	Baay'ee wal beeku.
It definitely needs some work here.	Asitti hojii tokko tokko akka barbaachisu beekamaadha.
But we are	Garuu nuti .
We have a lot to do in the morning.	Ganama waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabna.
He was very interested.	Inni baayʼee fedhii qaba ture.
She was exactly the right person.	Isheen sirriitti nama sirrii turte.
Of course, one can do such a thing.	Namni tokko waan akkasii hojjechuu akka dandaʼu beekamaadha.
You won’t in a year.	Waggaa tokko booda hin gootu.
A boy or a girl?	Gurbaa moo intala?
I didn’t know why.	Maaliif jedhee hin beeku ture.
What! 	Maal!
You have it in you.	Si keessa qabda.
She doesn’t think so.	Isheen akkas hin yaaddu.
Just stay inside.	Keessa turuu qofa.
That will never happen.	Sun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
Obviously it was a mistake.	Dogoggora akka ture ifaadha.
I like it that way.	Akkasitti natti tola.
Then it gets bad.	Sana booda hamaa ta'a.
She has two or three children.	Ijoollee lama sadii qabdi.
It worked.	Hojjete.
I wanted to have more of what was mine.	Waan kan koo ta'e caalaa akkan qabu barbaade.
I love my dog.	Saree koo nan jaalladha.
I love it so much!.	Ani baay'een jaalladha!.
As he has it.	Akkuma inni qabu.
He was really lucky.	Dhuguma carraa qaba ture.
I have been there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi tureera.
But it’s not that simple.	Garuu hangas salphaa miti.
It's going to be, it's going to be.	Ni ta'a, ni ta'a.
A good episode.	Kutaa gaarii.
I really want to be with her.	Dhuguma ishee waliin ta'uu barbaada.
Everyone seems to have been expecting this.	Namni hundi kana waan eegaa ture fakkaata.
He took another drink.	Dhugaatii biraa fudhate.
I couldn’t find her soon enough.	Dafee ishee argachuu hin dandeenye.
He can tell you.	Inni sitti himuu dandaʼa.
When to eat.	Yoom nyaachuu.
What's the matter? 	Maaltu ta'e?
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
This probably has some truth to it.	Kun dhugaa tokko tokko qabaachuu hin oolu.
I haven't met that one yet.	Isa sana hanga ammaatti hin wal argine.
He asked me about a lot of things.	Waa'ee waan baay'ee na gaafate.
There was still something they needed to do.	Ammas wanti isaan gochuu qaban tokko jira ture.
He has a chance.	Carraa qaba.
I think you did that.	Ati akkas goote natti fakkaata.
Lots and lots of ideas.	Yaada baay'ee fi baay'ee.
I just don't really know what that means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku qofa.
I knew him a little.	Xiqqoo isa beeka ture.
I didn’t see you there.	Achitti si hin argine.
We’re just looking for a name.	Maqaa qofa barbaadaa jirra.
That’s what comes from it.	Kan irraa dhufu kanuma.
It just wasn’t my job.	Hojii koo qofa hin turre.
Perhaps that is what she does.	Tarii waan isheen gootu akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
She didn't know what to do now.	Amma maal akka gootu hin beektu turte.
So, there you are.	Kanaaf, achi jirta.
Good stuff here.	Waan gaarii asitti.
No answer, of course.	Deebii hin qabu, beekamaadha.
Why is a good question.	Maaliif gaaffii gaarii dha.
All of it, this time.	Hundi isaa, yeroo kana.
Which never really happened before.	Kan kanaan dura dhuguma ta'ee hin beekne.
I couldn’t help but ask.	Gaafachuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
You’re not even really human.	Ati dhuguma nama illee miti.
Until recently, no one knew who he was.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti eenyu akka ta'e namni beeku hin turre.
I didn’t know him at the time.	Yeroo sanatti isa hin beeku ture.
I know you have it.	Akka ati qabdu nan beeka.
But it wasn’t quite what he had intended.	Garuu guutummaatti waan inni yaade hin turre.
I can only do some of that.	Sana keessaa muraasa qofa gochuu danda'a.
But nothing came out of my mouth.	Garuu wanti afaan koo keessaa ba'e hin jiru.
How often should it be?	Yeroo meeqa ta'uu qaba?
I think you are wrong.	Dogoggora akka jirtu natti fakkaata.
I still think of you.	Ammallee si yaada.
Two men were waiting for him.	Namoonni lama isa eegaa turan.
Tell me what you want.	Waan barbaaddu natti himi.
I have no idea how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I thought it was my time.	Yeroon koo natti fakkaate.
Not with these people.	Namoota kana waliin miti.
But it may not be.	Garuu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Sorry but its true.	Dhiifama garuu dhugaa isaa.
I think they’re a good thing.	Isaan waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
My little girl.	Intala koo xiqqoo.
I can see one possible reason here.	Sababni akkas ta’uu danda’u tokko asitti arguu nan danda’a.
But he accepted the facts.	Garuu dhugaa jiru fudhate.
There must be.	Jiraachuu qaba.
But I want to say something.	Ani garuu waan tokko jechuu barbaada.
It’s not just a mistake.	Dogoggora qofa miti.
What he said is just not true.	Wanti inni jedhe dhugaa miti qofa.
He never does.	Inni gonkumaa hin godhu.
I can't live like that anymore.	Kana booda akkas jiraachuu hin danda'u.
About another night.	Waa'ee halkan biraa.
That was once my favorite.	Sun yeroo tokko natti tola ture.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
All the noise, all the work, all that life.	Sagalee hunda, hojii hunda, jireenya sana hunda.
He certainly has money.	Maallaqa akka qabu beekamaadha.
But that’s just sometimes.	Garuu sun yeroo tokko tokko qofa.
Now that was nice.	Amma sun namatti tola ture.
We didn’t want him.	Nuti isa hin barbaanne.
Things could have been worse.	Silaa wanti jiru kana caalaa hamaa taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
Someone did this.	Namni tokko kana godhe.
He is extremely good to me.	Inni garmalee naaf gaarii dha.
I have them all over the house.	Mana guutuu keessa isaan qaba.
I really don't know what's good.	Dhuguma maaltu akka gaarii ta'e hin beeku.
Maybe it's the time of year.	Tarii yeroo waggaa ta'uu danda'a.
I have two questions about that.	Waa'ee sanaa gaaffii lama qaba.
It’s not even loud.	Sagalee guddaa illee miti.
No one else may know.	Namni biraa beekuu dhiisuu danda'a.
He was my favorite man.	Inni nama ani jaalladhu ture.
I would love you more if you were my man.	Osoo ati nama koo taate caalaa si jaalladha.
Not after work.	Hojii booda osoo hin taane.
So much of it.	Kanaaf baay'ee isaa.
A person going somewhere, they are doing something.	Namni bakka tokko deemu, waan tokko hojjechaa jiru.
I don’t think there’s anything more we can do.	Kana caalaa wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
Time, it just doesn't seem like enough.	Yeroon, waan gahaa ta'e qofa hin fakkaatu.
Everyone does that today.	Har'a namni hundi akkas godha.
I didn’t think it would work.	Ni hojjeta jedhee hin yaadne.
We need to help them.	Isaan gargaaruu qabna.
It didn’t seem necessary at the time.	Yeroo sanatti barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu ture.
I'm sure it works a lot.	Baayyee akka hojjetu mirkanaa'adha.
I can't have this in my house.	Kana mana koo keessatti qabaachuu hin danda'u.
Lots of stuff like that.	Waan akkasii baay'ee.
My feelings exactly.	Miira koo sirriitti.
Even this doesn't seem too bad.	Kun illee baayyee hamaa hin fakkaatu.
We didn't talk about it again for a while after that.	Sana booda yeroo muraasaaf ammas waa'ee isaa hin dubbanne.
I know it right there.	Achitti sirriitti beeka.
I knew that would never be enough.	Sun gonkumaa gahaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
I knew what would happen.	Maal akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
I know you can't talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka.
I’m just not there yet.	Ani ammallee achi hin jiru qofa.
This looks really nice.	Kun dhuguma namatti tola fakkaata.
It's going to be three.	Sadii ta'a.
Everything he said was true.	Wanti inni dubbate hundi dhugaa ture.
I have to go.	Deemuun qaba.
That's the time.	Yeroon sun.
But that was the other thing he said.	Garuu waan biraa inni jedhe sun ture.
We were willing to do this.	Kana gochuuf fedhii qabna turre.
I think he's right.	Inni sirrii natti fakkaata.
I don't want anything.	Ani homaa hin barbaadu.
You were going to.	Ati deemaa turte.
But she couldn't leave me.	Isheen garuu na dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
It's just not going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin deemu qofa.
They were absolutely fine.	Isaan guutummaatti gaarii turan.
She obviously didn't need much.	Waan baay'ee akka ishee hin barbaachifne ifaadha.
She certainly does about this issue.	Waa'ee dhimma kanaa akka isheen gootu beekamaadha.
I don't have a chance, though.	Carraa hin qabu garuu.
Then she did it again.	Sana booda ammas goote.
He quickly became interested.	Dafee fedhii qabaachuu jalqabe.
I am never alone.	Ani gonkumaa kophaa koo miti.
He does it when he really needs it.	Yeroo dhuguma barbaadu ni hojjeta.
He has his man.	Nama isaa qaba.
He doesn’t look good.	Inni gaarii hin fakkaatu.
they had to have.	qabaachuu qabu turan.
I love them so much.	Baay'een isaan jaalladha.
Too much forgiveness.	Garmalee dhiifama.
They just have to get it.	Argachuu qofa qabu.
Right where .	Sirriitti bakka .
You can't go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
At my house.	Mana kootti.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammade.
The job was hopeless.	Hojiin sun abdii kan hin qabne ture.
So you have to tell me what to do.	Kanaaf waan godhu natti himuu qabda.
What is it that is.	Maaltu dha.
She should have seen it coming, of course.	Silaa dhufuu isaa arguu qabdi turte, beekamaadha.
I don't know what time it is.	Sa'aatii meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku.
You have everything.	Waan hundumaa qabda.
That’s just how she is.	Akkas isheen jirtu qofa.
It didn’t work, it didn’t do anything.	Hin hojjenne, homaa hin hojjenne.
We are in place right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana bakka jirra.
But hers .	Garuu kan ishee .
He took his time.	Yeroo isaa fudhate.
I don't want to be alone.	Ani kophaa ta'uu hin barbaadu.
He needs those things.	Wantoota sana isa barbaachisa.
I didn't say anything.	Ani homaa hin dubbanne.
There was no one there.	Namni achi hin turre.
Now he could never do that.	Amma gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
It was just what happened.	Waan ta'e qofa ture.
I couldn't do it.	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye.
Language is important.	Afaan barbaachisaa dha.
I mean, it couldn't be worse.	Kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u jechuu kooti.
No one will help you with this.	Kanaan namni si gargaaru hin jiru.
He got two.	Lama argate.
They were walking a lot today.	Har'a baay'ee deemaa turan.
He is in his room.	Kutaa isaa keessa jira.
It’s working for me.	Naaf hojjechaa jira.
I am in exactly the same situation.	Anis sirriitti haala wal fakkaatu keessa jira.
you can have it.	qabaachuu dandeessa.
Not much, really.	Baay'ee miti, dhuguma.
We were just looking for something different.	Waan adda ta'e qofa barbaadaa turre.
What they need is a big old man.	Wanti isaan barbaachisu nama guddaa durii dha.
I still have no problems.	Ammas rakkoo hin qabu.
Everyone knows about them.	Waa'ee isaanii namni hundi ni beeka.
I'm just a human being.	Ani nama qofa.
All of us.	Hundi keenya.
We why they have their jobs.	Nuti maaliif hojii isaanii qaban.
With her and him.	Ishee fi inni waliin.
This is a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii dha.
But not everything.	Garuu waan hundumaa miti.
They belong to him and are in him.	Isaan kan isaa fi isa keessa jiru.
Like he never wanted anything.	Akkuma inni gonkumaa homaa hin barbaanne.
This seems to work.	Kun waan hojjetu fakkaata.
You, didn't and it's just not right.	Ati, hin goone fi sirrii miti qofa.
I haven’t seen it before.	Kana dura hin argine.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee.
I couldn’t help but do another.	Kan biraa gochuu malee hin dandeenye.
So you are my mother.	Kanaaf ati haadha kooti.
People without food.	Namoota nyaata hin qabne.
But, a big question.	Garuu, gaaffii guddaa.
I know his children.	Ijoollee isaa nan beeka.
He wasn’t looking at me.	Inni na ilaalaa hin turre.
None of this was for us.	Kun tokkollee nuuf hin turre.
I used to love it.	Duraan baay'een jaalladha ture.
I hope so but you never know.	Akkas akka ta'u abdiin qaba garuu gonkumaa hin beektu.
He wasn’t himself.	Inni ofii isaa hin turre.
I can't believe it's working so quickly.	Dafee hojjechaa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
But there is another reason.	Sababni biraa garuu jira.
He just thought he had it.	Inni qabu qofa itti fakkaate.
There will be.	Ni jiraata.
There is still hope.	Ammas abdiin jiraa.
That thing had a name.	Wanti sun maqaa qaba ture.
The amount of itself.	Hamma ofii.
They were like that for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas turan.
I won’t tell you what you are.	Ani maal akka taate sitti hin himu.
We never talked about it.	Waa'ee kanaa gonkumaa hin dubbanne.
Please go after the meal.	Mee nyaata booda deemaa.
But this is wrong.	Garuu kun dogoggora.
But that was a mistake.	Garuu sun dogoggora ture.
Now turn back.	Amma duubatti deebi'i.
This was what she wanted.	Kun waan isheen barbaaddu ture.
You can’t make a living off of it.	Isa irraa jireenya kee jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
He asked a question.	Gaaffii gaafate.
I didn’t know what to say to these people.	Namoota kanaan maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture.
He thought of everything he should have said.	Waan silaa dubbachuu qabu hunda yaade.
This was nothing.	Kun homaa hin turre.
Of course you can.	Akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
But it wasn’t her.	Garuu ishee hin turre.
That was all very vague.	Sun hundi baayyee ifa hin turre.
Mostly, I have to say it does.	Irra caalaa, ni qaba jechuu qaba.
I am new to this concept.	Ani yaada kanaan haaraa dha.
It’s my life.	Jireenya kooti.
This is right.	Kun sirrii dha.
I don't know who else it could be.	Kan biraa eenyu ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
There are so many things here.	Waan baay'ee as jiru.
But it can be anything.	Garuu waan hundumaa ta'uu danda'a.
Now he knew.	Amma beeka ture.
There was nothing she could do.	Wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
We need to know what we are doing.	Waan goonu beekuu qabna.
I knew it couldn't be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture.
I am a good person.	Ani nama gaarii dha.
It became very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e.
You should know this.	Kana beekuu qabdu.
I couldn’t get enough of him.	Isa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
But there wasn’t one.	Garuu tokko hin turre.
It was obvious he knew him.	Isa akka beeku ifa ture.
We need both of these things.	Wantoota kana lamaan nu barbaachisa.
But it shouldn't be like that.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
It's probably better not to tell anyone.	Osoo namatti hin himne gaarii ta'uu hin oolu.
There may be a little truth in that.	Sana keessa dhugaa xiqqoo jiraachuu danda'a.
But maybe she would have.	Garuu tarii ni qabdi turte ta'a.
The problem was me.	Rakkoon ana ture.
But that can't be right.	Garuu sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
You are doing well.	Gaarii hojjechaa jirta.
Good times and bad times.	Yeroo gaarii fi yeroo hamaa.
I know my father.	Abbaa koo nan beeka.
If he was unwilling, he seemed willing to do so.	Yoo fedhii hin qabne, akkas gochuuf fedhii kan qabu fakkaata ture.
Look at you two.	Isin lamaan ilaalaa.
That's nothing, isn't it?.	Sun homaa mitii?.
We don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu.
They had no feelings.	Miira tokkollee hin qaban turan.
I like it better than my way, don’t you?.	Karaa koo caalaa natti tola mitiiree?.
But it’s still there.	Garuu ammallee achi jira.
In the old house	Mana durii keessa
Come back with me.	Na waliin deebi'i.
He looked at her for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee ilaale.
No mistake, nothing.	Dogoggora hin qabu, homaa hin qabu.
He came a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura dhufe.
There was no problem.	Rakkoon tokkollee hin turre.
I still don’t do it.	Ammallee hin godhu.
Perhaps it was the shoes.	Tarii kophee sana taʼuu dandaʼa.
We are looking at this.	Kana ilaalaa jirra.
He was up ahead of me from somewhere.	Bakka tokko irraa ol na dura ture.
One day, though.	Guyyaa tokko garuu.
You are making a big mistake!	Dogoggora guddaa hojjechaa jirta!
I wouldn’t have known where she was.	Silaa eessa akka jirtu hin beeku ture.
I had no idea who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I need it.	Na barbaachisa.
He was pretty much nothing.	Inni baay'ee homaa hin turre.
Not like this morning.	Akka ganama kanaa miti.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
It occurred to me that we could help them.	Isaan gargaaruu akka dandeenyu natti dhufe.
He was alone there.	Achitti kophaa isaa ture.
But there’s really no right or wrong.	Garuu dhuguma sirrii fi dogoggora hin jiru.
She seems to know a lot about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee waan beektu fakkaata.
But these were not people he knew.	Garuu kun namoota inni beeku hin turre.
Still don't understand why though.	Ammas maaliif akka ta'e hin hubanne garuu.
Not entirely sure what happened.	Waan ta'e guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I wonder what happens now.	Amma maaltu ta'a jedheen yaada.
Then people could buy them.	Sana booda namoonni isaan bitachuu dandaʼu turan.
It would have been.	Silaa.
Of course, it does not usually work that way.	Yeroo baayʼee akkasitti akka hin hojjenne beekamaadha.
I'm not entirely sure.	Ani guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
This is where he came from.	Bakka inni dhufe kana.
I think this is a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
He has a big mouth.	Afaan guddaa qaba.
We just wanted the good old stuff.	Wantoota gaarii durii qofa barbaanne.
She couldn't believe this was happening again.	Kun ammas ta'aa jira jettee amanuu hin dandeenye.
I can get a job, if necessary.	Hojii argachuu nan danda'a, yoo barbaachisaa ta'e.
But it does more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa ni hojjeta.
Taller than me.	Ana caalaa dheeraa.
In this case, it works if everyone knows each other.	Haala kana keessatti namni hundi yoo wal beeku ni hojjeta.
It’s not all bad.	Hundi isaa hamaa miti.
She should have done it.	Silaa gochuu qabdi turte.
To be with me.	Ana waliin ta'uuf.
Everything about him was great.	Waa'ee isaa wanti hundi guddaa ture.
There is a reason for this, of course.	Kanaaf sababni akka jiru beekamaadha.
He did something.	Waan tokko hojjete.
It was great.	Guddaa ture.
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa.
It wouldn't have worked.	Silaa hin hojjetu ture.
But mostly on my own.	Garuu irra caalaa ofuma koo irratti.
I think it's now.	Amma natti fakkaata.
It would have been	Silaa .
We don’t even need your stuff.	Wanti keessan illee nu hin barbaachisu.
She didn't want that to happen.	Akkas akka ta'u hin barbaaddu turte.
She should not have done this.	Isheen kana gochuu hin qabdu turte.
It's rarely clear.	Yeroo muraasaaf ifa ta'a.
He has enough.	Inni gahaa qaba.
They all do the same.	Hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu godhu.
No one asked why.	Maaliif jedhee namni gaafate hin jiru.
It was very simple.	Baayyee salphaa ture.
But they were great about it.	Garuu isaan waa'ee isaa guddaa turan.
I didn’t think about it any more until recently.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti kana caalaa itti hin yaadne.
People still have to vote.	Namoonni ammallee sagalee kennuu qabu.
You know nothing about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beektu.
But it seems to be exactly what happened.	Garuu sirriitti waan ta'e fakkaata.
He even enjoyed his feelings.	Miira isaa illee itti gammade.
I could never do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe it was nothing.	Tarii homaa hin turre.
We just did what we could.	Waan dandeenyu qofa hojjenne.
It shouldn't have happened.	Silaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I think it’s the daily routine of my life.	Hojii guyyaa guyyaa jireenya koo natti fakkaata.
Otherwise you will never see it.	Yoo kana hin taane gonkumaa arguu hin dandeessu.
Something was wrong.	Waan tokko dogoggora ture.
But this does not seem to be the right way.	Garuu kun karaa sirrii kana hin fakkaatu.
Until it’s his.	Hanga isaatti.
It says that.	Akkas jedha.
It’s a really good feeling.	Dhuguma miira gaarii dha.
But it’s right.	Garuu sirrii dha.
You can never have too many friends.	Hiriyyoota baay'ee qabaachuu gonkumaa hin dandeessu.
She never does.	Isheen gonkumaa hin gootu.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
Everyone knows this danger.	Balaa kana namni hundi ni beeka.
It’s not his luck.	Carraa isaa miti.
We have a chance though.	Carraa qabna garuu.
Everything we wanted.	Waan barbaanne hunda.
He lives there with his wife and two children.	Haadha manaa isaa fi ijoollee isaa lama waliin achi jiraata.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Waan godhu sirriitti beeka ture.
What is that? 	Sun maali?
Not everyone can do it.	Namni hundi hin danda'u.
But it is more important than that.	Garuu kana caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
You should have seen my house.	Silaa mana koo arguu qabda turte.
This cannot be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin danda'u.
That would work just fine.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjeta ture.
They would be wrong.	Silaa dogoggora ta'u.
See where he goes, what he does.	Eessa akka deemu, maal akka hojjetu ilaalaa.
He was not a good man.	Nama hanga gaarii tokkollee hin turre.
But that couldn't happen too often.	Garuu sun yeroo baay'ee ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
She had to do this.	Kana gochuu qabdi turte.
This could very well be.	Kun baayyee gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
Look there, she said.	Achi ilaalaa jette.
There is a problem.	Rakkoon jiru.
They had once, not so long ago.	Yeroo tokko qaban turan, yeroo dheeraa dura miti.
But there was a chance.	Garuu carraan ture.
Nobody here would do that.	Namni as jiru akkas hin godhu ture.
It happened a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ta'e.
Will you be with us?.	Nu waliin ta'aa?.
It wouldn’t go any further.	Kana caalaa hin deemu ture.
It was about survival.	Waa'ee jiraachuu ture.
It’s new here.	Asitti haaraa dha.
But he didn't know him.	Garuu isa hin beekne.
I know who he is.	Eenyu akka ta'e nan beeka.
No one should find him here.	Namni asitti isa argachuu hin qabu.
I didn't do anything.	Ani homaa hin goone.
This was not one idea.	Kun yaada tokko hin turre.
There were two of them, both of them.	Isaan lama turan, lamaan isaanii.
None of that mattered.	Sana keessaa tokkollee barbaachisaa hin turre.
He was much taller than me.	Inni baayʼee na caalaa dheeraa ture.
He would never do that.	Inni gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
That is not the case today.	Har'a akkas miti.
But he didn’t know what else to do.	Garuu waan biraa akka godhu hin beeku ture.
I voted for him.	Anis sagalee isaaf kenne.
He went out to his house, afterwards.	Gara mana isaatti ba'e, booda.
From just three.	Sadii qofa irraa.
In the night.	Halkan keessa.
She didn’t know the area.	Naannoo sana hin beektu turte.
I think about a lot of things.	Waa'ee waan baay'ee nan yaada.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkasitti ta'uu qaba ture.
I often say things I don't agree with any of them.	Yeroo baayyee wantoota isaan keessaa tokkollee irratti walii hin galle nan jedha.
That’s just not true.	Sun dhugaa miti qofa.
Lots of problems.	Rakkoo baay'ee.
Seems easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata.
I think this is not right.	Kun sirrii miti jedheen yaada.
He always says that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedha.
He had to be mine.	Inni kan koo ta'uu qaba ture.
Now she was here.	Amma isheen as turte.
He looked a bit lonely though.	Inni garuu xiqqoo kophaa isaa fakkaata ture.
Then they are idle.	Sana booda hojii malee jiru.
It has been going on for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf deemaa tureera.
I think it sounds good.	Sagalee gaarii qaba jedheen yaada.
I just can't walk away.	Deemuu qofa hin danda'u.
You want his full time here.	Yeroo isaa guutuu asitti barbaaddu.
He shouldn't do this.	Kana gochuu hin qabu.
I like what he’s doing.	Waan inni hojjechaa jiru natti tola.
He may not be.	Inni taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
Can you please reply with your comments.	Mee yaada keessan waliin deebii kennuu dandeessu.
You need help.	Gargaarsa barbaaddu.
It wasn’t going to last long.	Yeroo dheeraa turuu hin turre.
Then, it was different.	Sana booda, adda ture.
You have one year.	Waggaa tokko qabda.
It was his father's watch.	Sa'aatii abbaa isaa ture.
Just my opinion.	Yaada koo qofa.
He had become a man.	Nama ta'ee ture.
He knew it was coming.	Inni akka dhufu ni beeka ture.
Who 'we' were.	Eenyu 'nuti' turre.
They never have it.	Isaan gonkumaa hin qaban.
Not sure about other places.	Waa'ee bakka biraa mirkanaa'aa miti.
This was a good one.	Kun gaarii ture.
That was what had happened.	Kan ta'ee ture kanuma ture.
Not much of it though.	Baay'ee isaa garuu miti.
I love going so much.	Deemu baay'een jaalladha.
He didn't have it.	Hin qabu ture.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
I really had no clue about it.	Dhuguma waaʼee kanaa waanan beeku hin qabu ture.
I will always love you.	Yeroo hundumaa si jaalladha.
Where was she going?	Eessa deemaa turte?
There was none of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
Easy to walk through.	Salphaa keessa deemuu.
They seem to have more in common than you might think.	Isaan waan ati yaaddu caalaa waan wal fakkaatu qabu fakkaata.
They can tell when you are different.	Yeroo ati adda taate beekuu danda'u.
I still don’t know what to do.	Ammallee maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
We can't stay.	Turuu hin dandeenyu.
It wasn’t a duty.	Dirqama hin turre.
This is your time.	Yeroon kun yeroo keessan.
This is just great.	Kun waan guddaa qofa.
I don't know how but he went with the money.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku garuu qarshii waliin deeme.
It’s a good idea.	Yaada gaarii dha.
It's not good.	Gaarii miti.
But I can say a few things about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa waan muraasa dubbachuu danda'a.
Then go home.	Sana booda gara manaatti deebi'i.
Seems.	Fakkaata.
Just like you now.	Akkuma kee amma.
In this case, as .	Haala kana keessatti, akka .
We have a lot of work to do.	Hojii hedduu qabna.
It’s not something like that.	Waan akkas miti.
Sometimes, it works.	Yeroo tokko tokko, ni hojjeta.
It had come from something bad.	Waan hamaa irraa dhufe ture.
I love that stuff.	Waan sana nan jaalladha.
You gotta get it, you gotta get it, you gotta get it!	Argachuu qabda, argachuu qabda, argachuu qabda!
I don't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
He would never be perfect.	Inni gonkumaa guutuu hin ta'u ture.
Morning is not your time of day, not so early.	Ganama yeroo guyyaa kee miti, akkas dafee miti.
I'm right there.	Ani sirriitti achi jira.
Not in anything.	Waan tokkollee keessatti miti.
You can't see it.	Arguu hin dandeessu.
I can't see how it could be bad for you.	Akkamitti siif hamaa ta'uu akka danda'u arguu hin danda'u.
I really want it to happen.	Akka ta'u baay'een barbaada.
You made it happen.	Ati akka gootu goote.
Not very extremely accurate.	Baayyee garmalee sirrii miti.
It seems pretty sure.	Baayyee mirkanaa'aa fakkaata.
You can find it at the door.	Balbala irratti argachuu dandeessu.
Just like she does.	Akkuma isheen gootu.
He thinks too much about it.	Garmalee itti yaada.
Everything, every single thing, was wrong.	Wanti hundi, wanti tokko tokko, dogoggora ture.
But it can be a bad thing.	Garuu waan hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
He quickly realized it wasn't much.	Baay'ee akka hin taane dafee hubate.
Before a lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee dura.
Sometimes he does that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas godha.
She needs a car.	Konkolaataa ishee barbaachisa.
What do I need to do here.	Asitti maal gochuun na barbaachisa.
It must be here.	Halkan ta'uu qaba.
She was never mine.	Isheen gonkumaa kan koo hin turre.
It looked so perfect.	Akkas guutuu fakkaata ture.
They still work.	Ammallee hojjetu.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
This is not the case now.	Kun amma akkas miti.
That was often the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas ture.
It’s a joke, of course.	Qoosaa akka ta’e beekamaadha.
It seems to work well.	Akka gaariitti waan hojjetu fakkaata.
That was all different now.	Sun hundi amma adda ture.
He is on his way there now.	Amma achitti karaa irra jira.
I think this is a mistake.	Kun dogoggora natti fakkaata.
I could dwell on that for a long, long time.	Sana irratti yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa jiraachuu nan danda'a ture.
Maybe a little bit.	Tarii xiqqoo xiqqoo ta'uu danda'a.
I couldn’t really do that.	Dhuguma akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
It was a good thing he didn’t have.	Waan gaarii inni hin qabne ture.
It looked exactly as it should.	Sirriitti akkuma ta'uu qabu fakkaata ture.
I like everything about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa natti tola.
That’s how it is.	Akkasitti jira.
Everything seemed easy.	Wanti hundi salphaa fakkaata ture.
You think it's right.	Sirriitti sitti fakkaata.
I can't help them.	Isaan gargaaruu hin danda'u.
You were great.	Ati guddaa turte.
This is exactly wrong.	Kun sirriitti dogoggora.
They had one person there, only one person.	Achitti nama tokko, nama tokko qofa qaban turan.
I don't know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
He went on to it.	Itti deeme.
I can't ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u.
Obviously someone has.	Namni tokko akka qabu ifaadha.
He still had it.	Ammas qaba ture.
Take a look though.	Mee ilaalaa garuu.
It was probably an accident.	Balaa taʼuu hin oolu.
One knows the other.	Tokko kan biraa beeka.
I know there is.	Akka jiru nan beeka.
I thought it was great.	Guddaa natti fakkaate.
Everything had to come from somewhere else.	Wanti hundi bakka biraa irraa dhufuu qaba ture.
You just know what to do.	Waan gootu qofa beekta.
That couldn't be her mother.	Sun haadha ishee ta'uu hin dandeenye.
Now they can.	Amma ni danda'u.
I can't get anything like that.	Akkasitti homaa argachuu hin danda'u.
She was right about them.	Waa'ee isaanii sirrii turte.
He tried not to think of anything.	Homaa akka hin yaadne yaale.
What does the problem look like? 	Rakkoon jiru maal fakkaata?
I haven’t seen him in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa hin argine.
Not the same people though.	Namoota tokko miti garuu.
I still had work to do.	Ammallee hojiin qaba ture.
So she did that.	Kanaaf akkas goote.
We need her home.	Mana ishee nu barbaachisa.
It was a great book for me.	Kitaaba guddaa naaf ture.
Again and then again.	Ammas booda ammas.
You are never alone.	Ati gonkumaa kophaa kee miti.
I don’t want him to leave just yet.	Amma qofa akka inni deemu hin barbaadu.
That wasn’t the case that day.	Guyyaa sana akkas hin turre.
They know you and they know how and why.	Si beeku akkamitti fi maaliif akka ta'e beeku.
It doesn't do anything.	Homaa hin godhu.
We are still working on it.	Ammas irratti hojjechaa jirra.
She was a good girl.	Intala gaarii turte.
She was always really good to me.	Yeroo hundumaa dhuguma naaf gaarii turte.
He would have known that.	Silaa sana ni beeka ture.
He now has a house.	Amma mana qaba.
She doesn’t like help.	Gargaarsa hin jaallattu.
It was my job.	Hojii koo ture.
All this stuff.	Wanti kun hundi.
But it’s not in there.	Garuu achi keessa miti.
I thought she wasn’t interested.	Fedhii hin qabdu jedheen yaade.
But there is still time.	Garuu ammallee yeroon jira.
I just want to see more.	Ani garuu kana caalaa arguu barbaada.
But this is not enough.	Garuu kun gahaa miti.
I can't tell you exactly everything he does.	Waan inni hojjetu hunda sirriitti himuu hin danda'u.
You couldn’t even ask your parents for any help.	Gargaarsa tokko illee warra kee gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
We only had one car.	Konkolaataa tokko qofa qabna turre.
This was not going very well.	Kun baayyee gaarii hin taane ture.
No way.	Gonkumaa hin ta'u.
It just wasn’t there now.	Amma hin turre qofa.
It worked well for me.	Naaf gaarii naaf hojjete.
A great promise.	Waadaa guddaa.
I don’t want to work anywhere else.	Bakka biraa hojjechuu hin barbaadu.
It was a good job.	Hojii gaarii ture.
You would need it if she didn't.	Osoo isheen hin goone ta'ee si barbaachisa ture.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
That is absolutely not true.	Sun gonkumaa dhugaa miti.
Locals know little about her.	Namoonni naannoo sanaa waa'ee ishee waan xiqqoo beeku.
When it was before.	Yeroo duraan ture.
This, however, seems to us to be unnecessary.	Kun garuu waan hin qabne nutti fakkaata.
She didn't know where she was.	Eessa akka jirtu hin beekne.
You'll like it.	Sitti tola.
I wouldn't have been able to go.	Silaa deemuu hin danda'u ture.
That worked for me.	Sun naaf hojjete.
When in reality .	Yeroo dhugaa keessa jiru .
I think he is.	Inni natti fakkaata.
Her good clothes.	Uffata ishee gaarii.
That wasn’t so bad.	Sun akkas hamaa hin turre.
But maybe it's not that simple.	Garuu tarii hangas salphaa miti ta'a.
It still could have been worse.	Ammas kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
No one could believe it.	Namni amanuu hin dandeenye.
Sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko.
If in yours.	Yoo kee keessa.
He didn't have it.	Hin qabu ture.
I could have done something else.	Silaa waan biraa hojjechuu danda'a ture.
We’re doing the best we can.	Waan dandeenyu hunda hojjechaa jirra.
Except it had been her mother's.	Kan haadha ishee ta'ee ture malee.
No one likes him.	Namni isa jaallatu hin jiru.
He needs another chance.	Carraa biraa barbaada.
And I just said it.	Anis jedheen qofa.
How it will help you become who you are today.	Har'a akka taate ta'uuf akkamitti akka si gargaaru.
It was his house.	Mana isaa ture.
It was no longer clear.	Kana booda ifa hin turre.
I could see no way around it.	Karaa itti naannoo isaa jiru tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
It has a lot and a good one.	Baay'ee fi gaarii qaba.
But it was one of those nights.	Garuu halkan sana keessaa tokko ture.
But only to a certain extent.	Garuu hanga tokko qofa.
They had none of it.	Isaan tokkollee hin qaban turan.
They were there, then gone.	Isaan achi turan, sana booda hin turre.
I want to give up something good.	Waan gaarii tokko dhiisuu barbaada.
He doesn’t like that.	Inni akkas hin jaallatu.
I doubt that would be easy.	Sun salphaa akka ta'u nan shakka.
I mean, I'm not sure.	jechuu kooti.
Someone was inside.	Namni tokko keessa ture.
He always speaks his mind.	Yeroo hundumaa yaada isaa dubbata.
Now you are not there.	Amma ati hin jirtu.
But it does work.	Garuu hojii hojjeta.
It just wasn’t right.	Sirrii hin turre qofa.
She always had, until recently.	Yeroo hundumaa qabdi turte, hanga yeroo dhiyootti.
At best it’s not good enough.	Yoo gaarii ta’e gahaa miti.
Not very good.	Baayyee gaarii miti.
But no more of this anymore.	Garuu kana booda kana caalaa hin jiru.
Had the same problem.	Rakkoo wal fakkaatu qaba ture.
He was a good man.	Nama gaarii ture.
He certainly worked for us, so he could definitely help.	Inni nuuf hojjete beekamaadha, kanaaf gargaaruu akka danda'u beekamaadha.
I can always go.	Yeroo hundumaa deemuu nan danda'a.
He will probably do this again.	Ammas kana gochuun isaa hin oolu.
I just went away.	Anis qofa deeme.
We have a problem.	Rakkoo qabna.
Eat the right amount of food.	Nyaata hamma sirrii ta’e nyaachuu.
I thought you were.	Ati natti fakkaate.
It's very large.	Baayyee guddaa dha.
He looked at it again.	Ammas ilaale.
People know this.	Namoonni kana ni beeku.
But he knew it.	Inni garuu ni beeka ture.
Everything is fully in it, fully in everything.	Wanti hundi guutummaatti keessa jira, guutummaatti waan hundumaa keessa jira.
That’s not his daughter.	Sun intala isaa miti.
I thought this worked, a lot of people didn't.	Kun waan hojjete natti fakkaate, namoonni baay'een hin hojjenne.
I couldn’t do that now.	Amma akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
It’s not my problem.	Rakkoo koo miti.
He can go.	Deemu danda'a.
She is very tall I must say.	Isheen baayyee dheeraa dha jechuun qaba.
It’s not there but it’s there.	Achi hin jiru garuu achi jira.
He wasn't wrong about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dogoggora hin turre.
You know you want it.	Akka barbaaddu ni beekta.
That’s how he looked at me.	Akkasitti na ilaale.
She always had it.	Yeroo hundumaa qabdi turte.
Very, very, very many.	Baay'ee baay'ee baay'ee.
If you do that.	Yoo akkas goote.
It happens in real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti ni ta'a.
This is most important.	Kun hunda caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
Love your thoughts.	Yaada kee jaalladhu.
He wanted to eat them.	Isaan nyaachuu barbaade.
I'm not so sure.	Ani akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I knew this could happen.	Kun ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka ture.
We are almost .	Nuti jechuun ni danda'ama .
We are one person.	Nuti nama tokko.
But he didn't understand her.	Garuu ishee hin hubanne.
But that’s me.	Garuu sun ana.
It was in his shoes.	Kophee isaa keessa ture.
Not many job opportunities here.	Asitti carraan hojii baay'ee miti.
Not often though.	Yeroo baayyee miti garuu.
It was very different.	Baayyee adda ture.
We were together for three years.	Waggaa sadii waliin turre.
I could find her place.	Bakka ishee argachuu nan danda'a ture.
He needs to know how this happened.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'e beekuu qaba.
He was working on her.	Ishee irratti hojjechaa ture.
I'm excited.	Ani gammadeera.
One of us must speak!	Tokko keenya dubbachuu qaba!
His light.	Ifa isaa.
Fortunately, this is nothing new.	Akka carraa ta'ee kun waan haaraa miti.
One, not many.	Tokko, baay'ee miti.
But somewhere, there is no light.	Garuu bakka tokko tokko, ifa hin jiru.
He seemed to know what he was doing.	Waan godhu waan beeku fakkaata ture.
He had this.	Kana qaba ture.
Still not enough.	Ammas gahaa miti.
This one, however, is different.	Inni kun garuu adda.
I have been going everywhere.	Bakka hunda deemaa tureera.
That’s not all.	Kanuma miti.
He was on it.	Inni irra ture.
That's how it happens most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee akkas ta'a.
They should have earned this.	Kana argachuu qabu turan.
I love him very, very much.	Baay'ee baay'een isa jaalladha.
The answer is that.	Deebii kan.
Sometimes that was all that helped.	Yeroo tokko tokko wanti gargaaru kanuma qofa ture.
I love his work so much.	Hojii isaa baay'een jaalladha.
Only then did he speak.	Sana booda qofa dubbate.
That's just about everyone.	Sun nama hunda qofa jechuun ni danda'ama.
Then he started.	Sana booda jalqabe.
But it was something else.	Garuu waan biraa ture.
You have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
But it wasn't supposed to be right.	Garuu sirrii ta'uu hin qabu ture.
We still have a long way to go.	Ammas karaa dheeraa qabna.
He stayed there all night.	Halkan guutuu achi ture.
He was very funny.	Inni baayyee nama qoosaa ture.
He still has his time.	Ammas yeroo isaa qaba.
They need a home.	Mana isaan barbaachisa.
But that would be wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora ta'a.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
Good luck!	Carraa gaarii!
He said there was no time.	Yeroon akka hin jirre dubbateera.
I know you will.	Akka gootu nan beeka.
I know what you look like.	Maal akka fakkaattu nan beeka.
Just like you.	Akkuma kee.
Look outside.	Ala ilaalaa.
But, that never happened.	Garuu, sun gonkumaa hin taane.
I told him it wasn’t bright enough.	Ifa gahaa akka hin taane itti hime.
It could be his mother's house.	Mana haadha isaa ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't even know what time it was anymore.	Kana booda sa'aatii meeqa akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture.
You know what’s out there.	Waan ala jiru ni beektu.
That’s a good part.	Sun kutaa gaarii dha.
It was obvious he was looking for me.	Na barbaadaa akka ture ifa ture.
Everything else works.	Wanti biraa hundi ni hojjeta.
I couldn’t stay much longer.	Kana caalaa yeroo dheeraa turuu hin dandeenye.
I say you don’t need it.	Si hin barbaachisu nan jedha.
I don’t want kids anymore.	Kana booda ijoollee hin barbaadu.
I enjoyed the moment.	Yeroo sanatti gammadeera.
Now she had friends.	Amma hiriyyoota qabdi turte.
Perhaps it is a mistake.	Tarii dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼa.
There is no one before him.	Namni isa dura hin jiru.
At the time, he probably had nothing.	Yeroo sanatti tarii homaa hin qabu ture.
I don't think anyone can.	Namni waan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu.
This is extremely important.	Kun garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
You have a question and you need help.	Gaaffii qabda gargaarsa si barbaachisa.
They waited for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf eegaa turan.
But nothing happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e hin turre.
Then next month.	Sana booda ji'a dhufu.
I saw that again.	Ammas sana arge.
He certainly didn’t care at all.	Inni tasumaa dhimma akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
I'm happy here.	Asitti gammadeera.
He wasn’t expecting that.	Inni akkas eegaa hin turre.
I think it's true.	Dhugaa natti fakkaata.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
Someone needs to do something about that.	Sana irratti namni tokko waan tokko gochuu qaba.
Try them for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan yaalaa.
Two things probably happened.	Wanti lama ta’uu hin oolu.
It’s really a bad thing.	Dhuguma waan hamaa.
It was a joke.	Qoosaa ture.
He had time.	Yeroo qaba ture.
And yet he had to leave her again.	Ammas ammas ishee dhiisuu qaba ture.
I'm so, so sorry.	Ani akkas, baay'ee dhiifama.
You couldn’t give up.	Ati harka kennuu hin dandeenye.
It’s not really sound.	Dhuguma sagalee miti.
It was a feeling he knew all too well.	Miira inni sirriitti beeku ture.
It was a complete disaster.	Balaa guutuu ture.
Can you tell me if something is wrong?	Yoo wanti tokko dogoggora ta'e natti himuu dandeessaa?
Lots of questions.	Gaaffii baay'ee.
This no longer works.	Kun kana booda hin hojjetu.
She was doing great.	Waan guddaa hojjechaa turte.
I used to think reality was the most important thing.	Duraan dhugaa jiru waan hunda caalaa barbaachisaa natti fakkaata ture.
I go with her.	Ishee waliin deema.
But we can't.	Garuu hin dandeenyu.
I can't stay here.	As turuu hin danda'u.
Neither of us said much in the car.	Lamaan keenyayyuu konkolaataa keessatti waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
What’s more?	Maal caalaa?
No one does it better.	Namni kana caalaa hojjetu hin jiru.
No one knew anything.	Namni homaa beeku hin turre.
I didn’t want to do this.	Ani kana gochuu hin barbaanne.
It couldn't have been good.	Silaa gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
She was still in a good mood.	Ammas miira gaarii keessa turte.
You can do what you have at your disposal.	Waan harka kee jiru hojjechuu dandeessa.
You don’t understand.	Siif hin galle.
I just have no idea.	Ani yaada tokkollee hin qabu qofa.
There is no one like him.	Namni akka isaa hin jiru.
To be with you.	Isin waliin ta'uuf.
That's right.	Sun sirrii dha.
That would be really great.	Sun dhuguma guddaa ta'a.
This was not true.	Kun dhugaa hin turre.
It can be a little lonely.	Xiqqoo kophaa ta'uu danda'a.
Again, it was a mistake.	Ammas dogoggora ture.
She said she should tell this now.	Kana amma himuu qabdi jette.
You are doing a great job!.	Hojii guddaa hojjechaa jirta!.
I love him very much.	Baay'een isa jaalladha.
Probably my favorite book of all time.	Tarii kitaaba yeroo hundumaa jaalladhu ta'uu danda'a.
Not out here, not in this place.	As ala miti, bakka kana miti.
Things I no longer have.	Wantoota kana booda hin qabne.
But we are not those people.	Nuti garuu namoota sana miti.
It’s not us, it’s not them.	Nu miti isaan miti.
He didn't want her.	Ishee hin barbaanne.
I'm not even sure it works.	Akka hojjetu illee mirkanaa'aa miti.
But I didn't want it to happen.	Garuu akka ta'u hin barbaanne.
We don’t need it.	Nu hin barbaachisu.
That’s just the truth.	Sun dhugaa qofa.
I can do good things.	Waan gaarii hojjechuu nan danda'a.
You have to be.	Ta'uu qabda.
They are in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jiru.
If you were.	Osoo ati turte.
She had an idea.	Yaada tokko qabdi turte.
Some people loved this.	Namoonni tokko tokko kana ni jaallatu turan.
I don’t think that’s what he was looking for.	Waan inni barbaadaa ture sana natti hin fakkaatu.
I like the work.	Hojiin natti tola.
Needless to say, all of them are a handful.	Hundi isaanii harka muraasa jechuun hin barbaachisu.
Not unreasonable, you may think.	Sababa hin qabne miti jettanii yaaddu taʼa.
Can you help ?.	Gargaaruu dandeessu ?.
What you said.	Waan ati jette.
I didn’t do it well.	Ani akka gaariitti hin hojjenne.
Nothing is more important to us.	Nuuf wanti kana caalaa barbaachisaa ta’e hin jiru.
It must be in there.	Achi keessa ta'uu qaba.
But he really needs to get this.	Dhuguma garuu kana argachuu qaba.
That can be a problem.	Sun rakkoo taʼuu dandaʼa.
It had already been a very long night.	Duraan halkan baayyee dheeraa ta'ee ture.
I still think about it.	Ammallee itti yaada.
This is mostly but not entirely accurate.	Kun irra caalaa garuu guutummaatti sirrii miti.
I’m working around this.	Naannoo kana hojjechaa jira.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Waan hojjetu sirriitti beeka ture.
For the most part, it didn’t matter what he did.	Irra caalaa wanti inni hojjete homaa hin turre.
What he did.	Waan inni hojjete.
I doubt he's right.	Sirrii ta'uu isaa nan shakka.
Not often though.	Yeroo baay’ee miti garuu.
The chances are not good.	Carraan gaarii miti.
It was fresh, contemporary and great.	Haaraa, yeroo ammaa fi guddaa ture.
I will do it again.	Ammas nan godha.
Something would have happened.	Silaa wanti tokko ni ta'a ture.
You mean.	Ati jechuun.
It’s in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa jira.
What was so important was who he was.	Kan akkas barbaachisaa ta'e eenyu akka ta'e ture.
That’s why I’m here.	Kanaaf as jira.
She’s never like that.	Isheen gonkumaa akkas hin jirtu.
But it doesn’t work in the long run.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa keessatti hin hojjetu.
But it can be done.	Garuu ta'uu danda'a.
Someone want to tell me what's going on?	Namni tokko waan ta'aa jiru natti himuu barbaadaa?
I could always find it.	Yeroo hunda argachuu nan danda'a ture.
It wouldn't be .	Hin ta'u ture .
Every night of the week.	Torban keessaa halkan hunda.
I never do it.	Ani gonkumaa hin godhu.
But she didn't have it.	Isheen garuu hin qabdu turte.
You have to know how to do it.	Akkamitti akka gootu beekuu qabda.
But I can't make it work.	Garuu akka hojjetu gochuu hin danda'u.
We are there to work on ourselves.	Of irratti hojjechuuf achi jirra.
He is going with me.	Ana waliin deemaa jira.
He was just too obvious.	Inni garmalee ifa qofa ture.
It doesn't matter though.	Dhimma hin qabu garuu.
Long, and very wide.	Dheeraa, fi baayyee bal'aa.
I used to do that.	Duraan akkas nan godha ture.
The clock.	Sa'aatii.
I don't want to be anyone else.	Ani nama biraa ta'uu hin barbaadu.
So they may stop looking.	Kanaaf barbaadaa dhiisuu danda'u.
But you know how it goes.	Garuu akkamitti akka deemu beekta.
That’s not a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa miti.
They want me here.	Asitti na barbaadu.
I didn’t know if it would work.	Ni hojjeta moo hin hojjetu jedhee hin beeku ture.
He quickly became himself.	Dafee of ta'e.
This wasn’t working.	Kun hojjechaa hin turre.
It was still early.	Ammallee dafee ture.
He loves you.	Inni si jaallata.
Things were different at my parents’ house.	Mana warra kootti wanti jiru adda ture.
As they are in me.	Akkuma ana keessa jiru.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Kana jechuun homaa jechuu miti.
I couldn't find your question here.	Gaaffii keessan asitti argachuu hin dandeenye.
You're home now, boy.	Amma mana jirta gurbaa.
We may never know for sure.	Tarii gonkumaa mirkanaa'aa ta'ee beekuu hin dandeenyu ta'a.
I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
None of you have anyone.	Isin keessaa tokkollee nama hin qabu.
You know, you know.	Ni beektu.
He stayed there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa achi ture.
It worked many times.	Yeroo baayyee hojjete.
Which would have been bad.	Kan silaa hamaa ta'a ture.
I didn't want much.	Waan baay'ee hin barbaanne.
Not any of it.	Isa keessaa tokkollee miti.
A simple matter.	Dhimma salphaa.
That's how it came out.	Akkasitti ba'e.
That would have been nice.	Silaa sun gaarii ture.
Only then did he notice.	Yeroo sana qofa kan hubate.
I can't speak to it.	Itti dubbachuu hin danda'u.
It was a complete disaster!	Balaa guutuu ture!
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
He is not a bad man.	Nama hamaa miti.
This time it was easy.	Yeroo kana salphaa ture.
I can come back another time.	Yeroo biraa deebi'uu nan danda'a.
But now you know.	Amma garuu beekta.
She was everywhere.	Isheen bakka hundumaa turte.
Why are you there.	Maaliif jirta.
This, not so much.	Kun, hangas miti.
Check it out, it's pretty cool.	Mee ilaalaa, baayyee namatti tola.
I wasn’t working.	Ani hojjechaa hin turre.
One hour of sleep is not enough.	Hirriba sa'aatii tokko gahaa miti.
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
It's just what's happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru qofa.
He wanted to be.	Ta'uu barbaade.
But you don't care.	Garuu isin dhimma hin qabdu.
We are still waiting.	Ammas eegaa jirra.
We’re going to make the best come of this.	Kana keessaa waan gaarii akka dhufu gochuuf jirra.
Someone else could have filled them.	Namni biraa isaan guutuu danda'a ture.
But we are not all the same.	Garuu hundi keenya tokko miti.
But I just wanted to do one.	Garuu tokko qofa hojjechuu barbaade.
I mean , it does	Ni qaba jechuu kooti .
But most of the time, we can't get it.	Garuu yeroo baayyee, argachuu hin dandeenyu.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
It will be your eyes.	Ija kee ta'a.
Extremely.	Akka malee.
This doesn't work.	Kun hin hojjetu.
Then, he had another idea.	Sana booda, yaada biraa qaba ture.
I haven’t seen it before.	Kana dura hin argine.
It could go a bit further than that though.	Kana caalaa xiqqoo deemuu danda'a garuu.
Sometimes it went well.	Yeroo tokko tokko gaarii ta'ee deema ture.
I couldn't tell you.	Sitti himuu hin dandeenye.
I thought you were interested.	Fedhii qabda jedheen yaade.
He was still a boy.	Ammas gurbaa ture.
He came before you.	Si dura dhufe.
He's not here today.	Har'a as hin jiru.
I know you very well.	Ani akka gaariitti si beeka.
But it certainly isn’t necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I like them.	Isaan natti tola.
All the way back.	Karaa hunda duubatti.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
It's still on.	Ammas irra jira.
Look at that guy.	Mee ilaalaa gurbaa sana.
I couldn’t answer it.	Deebii itti kennuu hin dandeenye.
I think it will be soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti ta'a jedheen yaada.
Only not everyone does.	Qofa namni hundi hin godhu.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
I still have it.	Ammas qaba.
He had to go a few weeks ago.	Torban muraasa dura deemuu qaba ture.
They would have to come from somewhere else.	Silaa bakka biraa irraa dhufuu qabu turan.
You can buy him a drink.	Dhugaatii isaaf bitachuu dandeessa.
Now it was only a matter of time.	Amma dhimma yeroo qofa ture.
You have everything you need.	Waan si barbaachisu hunda qabda.
I'm not the one.	Ani miti.
This is not an idea.	Kun yaada miti.
In the eyes of the children.	Ija ijoollee irratti.
I didn’t think anyone would do that.	Namni akkas godhu natti hin fakkaatu ture.
That should never happen.	Sun gonkumaa ta’uu hin qabu.
So what is it? 	Eegaa maal?
But he went further.	Inni garuu kana caalaa deeme.
He was doing his job.	Hojii isaa hojjechaa ture.
And it’s still the same.	Ammas kanuma.
This is not your business.	Kun dhimma keessan miti.
Things are good right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti jiru gaarii dha.
We just have to work harder.	Caalaatti hojjechuu qofa qabna.
You can go further.	Kana caalaa deemuun ni danda’ama.
It was their place.	Bakka isaanii ture.
Too good to be.	Ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii dha.
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo miti.
In two years that won't happen.	Waggaa lama booda sun hin ta'u.
He has one hand.	Harka tokko qaba.
It’s important.	Barbaachisaa dha.
Your not sure.	Keessan mirkanaa'aa miti.
In the extreme.	Garmalee keessa.
He was so great.	Inni akka malee guddaa ture.
Again, this is good.	Ammas kun gaarii dha.
Things are a little different here.	Asitti wanti xiqqoo adda adda.
Some father he was.	Abbaa tokko tokko inni ture.
But he realized it meant money.	Garuu qarshii jechuu akka ta'e hubate.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Waan gaarii hin turre.
Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.	Akka carraa ta'ee wanti ati gochuu dandeessu jira.
I don’t know what’s in there.	Waan achi keessa jiru hin beeku.
I have no idea how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu.
That's how it happened.	Akkasitti ta'e.
Meant.	Jechuu barbaade.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
But this will never happen.	Garuu kun yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
I can see everything.	Waan hundumaa arguu nan danda'a.
This is extremely important.	Kun garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
You’re working too hard on it.	Garmalee itti hojjechaa jirta.
He needs to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qaba.
Very dangerous but nice about it.	Baayyee balaa qaba garuu waa'ee isaa namatti tola.
There was no other such person.	Namni akkasii kan biraa hin turre.
She hadn't said anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne turte.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
But this is not the right way because.	Garuu kun karaa sirrii miti sababa.
I'll be good for you.	Ani gaarii siif ta'a.
I know this, but it wasn’t really an excuse.	Kana nan beeka, garuu dhuguma sababa hin turre.
It just has to be one thing.	Waan tokko qofa ta'uu qaba.
He can go.	Inni deemuu danda'a.
Probably, never.	Tarii, gonkumaa miti.
I may not even be a real person.	Ani nama dhugaa illee taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
They are still out there.	Ammallee ala jiru.
We did that.	Nuti akkas goone.
No one said much.	Namni waan baay'ee dubbate hin jiru.
I don't know why this worked.	Kun maaliif akka hojjete hin beeku.
Not exactly sure.	Sirriitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I didn’t have that kind of time.	Yeroo akkasii hin qabu ture.
They all work well.	Hundi isaanii akka gaariitti hojjetu.
So, something could be wrong.	Kanaaf, wanti tokko dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼa.
I still couldn’t see her.	Ammallee ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
This was the day.	Kun guyyaa ture.
I don’t have to.	Dirqama hin qabu.
I have no idea why he left.	Maaliif akka deeme yaada hin qabu.
But that is not the problem in the case before us.	Garuu dhimma nu dura jiru keessatti rakkoon jiru kanuma miti.
No one understood him.	Namni isa hubate hin jiru.
But he knew he got a feeling.	Garuu miira tokko akka argate beeka ture.
I'm looking for him.	Ani isa nan barbaada.
He loved them, but then he had no shoes before them.	Isaan ni jaallata ture, garuu sana booda isaan dura kophee hin qabu ture.
But there is only one.	Garuu tokko qofa.
Always,' he said.	Yeroo hunda,' jedhe.
There was always that possibility.	Yeroo hundumaa carraan sun ni jira ture.
I had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I know why it happened.	Maaliif akka ta'e nan beeka.
They will do it again.	Ammas ni godhu.
I wonder why they didn’t.	Maaliif hin goone jedheen yaada.
I think.	Nan yaada.
She was loud.	Isheen sagalee guddaa qabdu turte.
It didn't matter.	Dhimma hin qabu ture.
He obviously is.	Inni akka ta'e ifaadha.
But he is no longer there.	Garuu kana booda hin jiru.
Not without a few problems, though.	Rakkoo muraasa malee miti garuu.
Go this way.	Karaa kanaan deemaa.
he must say.	jechuu qaba.
Things weren’t the same as they used to be.	Wanti akka duraan ture hin turre.
I couldn’t live without him.	Isa malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
He wanted to do his job.	Hojii isaa hojjechuu barbaade.
She had to talk to him about it.	Waa'ee kanaa itti dubbachuu qabdi turte.
It must be pretty bad.	Baayyee hamaa ta'uu qaba.
But it shouldn't be like that.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
It was just a question.	Gaaffii qofa ture.
I didn’t really think about this.	Kana sirriitti hin yaadne.
We got into that era.	Bara sana keessa galle.
Who is there? 	Eenyutu jira?
We can’t do it here.	Asitti gochuu hin dandeenyu.
I know you're a good person.	Nama gaarii ta'uu kee nan beeka.
Maybe, but not necessarily.	Tarii, garuu dirqama miti.
I knew the answer.	Deebii isaa nan beeka ture.
I'm not entirely sure.	Ani guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
Then someone else passed.	Sana booda namni biraa darbe.
He was not in good shape.	Haala gaarii keessa hin turre.
He goes with you.	Inni si waliin deema.
Simple and works great.	Salphaa fi guddaa hojjeta.
But only for a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
They always have something for you to do!	Yeroo hundumaa waan siif gootu qabu!
Otherwise, chances are .	Yoo kana hin taane, carraa .
The work was getting great.	Hojiin sun guddaa ta'aa ture.
None of it was needed.	Tokkollee hin barbaachifne.
This one would work.	Inni kun ni hojjeta ture.
He is in a very bad place.	Bakka baayyee hamaa keessa jira.
This is really, really obvious!	Kun dhuguma, dhuguma ifaadha!
Probably not a big deal.	Tarii dhimma guddaa miti.
But it still happens.	Garuu ammallee ni ta'a.
No one out there knew about it.	Namni ala jiru tokkollee waa'ee kanaa beeku hin turre.
I never want to go back to that life.	Jireenya sanatti deebi'uu gonkumaa hin barbaadu.
It didn’t look too good.	Garmalee gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
It happened so quickly.	Akkas dafee ta'e.
Sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko.
That is not what we thought.	Kan nuti yaadne akkas miti.
You know where he is.	Bakka inni jiru ni beekta.
Not that picture.	Suuraa sana miti.
But that’s not the case anymore.	Garuu kana booda akkas miti.
That wasn’t the case two years ago.	Waggaa lama dura akkas hin turre.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
But he didn't think so.	Garuu akkas jedhee hin yaadne.
But this, they know, is important.	Garuu kun, barbaachisaa ta’uu ni beeku.
That's what happened.	Kan ta'e kanuma.
That's more of it.	Caalaatti kanuma.
But you don't.	Ati garuu hin gootu.
We have help.	Gargaarsa qabna.
He had no daughter.	Intala hin qabu ture.
It doesn't mean anything.	Homaa jechuu miti.
What should we do about them.	Waa'ee isaanii maal gochuu qabna.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
Soon they will be here to help.	Yeroo dhiyootti gargaaruuf as ni dhufu.
Go with her.	Ishee waliin deemaa.
I thought you knew something.	Ati waan beektu natti fakkaate.
Not.	Miti.
I wasn't sure what came out.	Maaltu akka ba'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I shouldn't be like that, I shouldn't be.	Ani akkas ta'uu hin qabu, ta'uu hin qabu.
I knew that, too.	Anis kana nan beeka ture.
I knew then what could happen.	Yeroo sanatti waan ta'uu danda'u nan beeka ture.
This usually works.	Kun yeroo baayyee hojjeta.
I think she needs to do that a little bit.	Xiqqoo sana gochuu qabdi jedheen yaada.
It had happened.	Ta'ee ture.
I didn’t understand that at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas naaf hin galle.
You are almost certainly right.	Ati sirrii ta'uu kee hin oolu jechuun ni danda'ama.
I didn’t think it was a big deal.	Waan guddaa natti hin fakkaatu ture.
I was a schoolteacher.	Ani barsiisaa mana barumsaa ture.
I have three answers.	Deebii sadii qaba.
Everything is going badly.	Wanti hundi hamaa deemaa jira.
Nothing seemed to matter.	Wanti dhimma qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
Again, they are right.	Ammas, isaan sirrii dha.
But it is no longer her home.	Garuu kana booda mana ishee miti.
I can live with the parents.	Warra waliin jiraachuu nan danda'a.
You have a problem.	Rakkoo qabda.
Wait a little longer.	Xiqqoo eegaa.
I don't know what happened to him.	Maal akka isa ta'e hin beeku.
Some weeks.	Torban tokko tokko.
But I don't think he does.	Inni garuu waan godhu natti hin fakkaatu.
The worst one.	Kan hamaa ta'e.
Very important question to ask yourself.	Gaaffii baayyee barbaachisaa of gaafachuu qabdu.
It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t bad.	Guddaa hin turre, garuu hamaa hin turre.
She has friends.	Hiriyyoota qabdi.
It’s there but it’s not there.	Achi jira garuu hin jiru.
He says he has no answers.	Deebii tokkollee hin qabu jedha.
The job was easy.	Hojiin sun salphaa ture.
It’s my part.	Kutaa kooti.
Luck was entirely a matter of luck.	Carraan guutummaatti dhimma carraa ture.
But twice wasn’t enough.	Garuu yeroo lama gahaa hin turre.
But I wanted to talk about it.	Garuu waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu barbaade.
It was hers now.	Amma kan ishee ture.
I didn’t say anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa hin dubbanne.
I want to be in the here and now.	Ani as fi amma keessa ta'uu barbaada.
But that doesn’t make it bad.	Garuu sun hamaa hin godhu.
I’m still educating myself on that one.	Ammallee isa sana irratti of barsiisaa jira.
But no one is there.	Garuu namni achi hin jiru.
I can still do it.	Ammallee nan danda'a.
A little goes a long way.	Xiqqoo karaa dheeraa deema.
I hadn’t made any mistakes.	Dogoggora tokkollee hin hojjenne ture.
Everything he did was like that.	Wanti inni godhu hundi akkas ture.
You can’t be doing that.	Ati akkas gochaa jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
I don't say why.	Maaliif hin jedha.
Boy, he does when he can.	Gurbaa, yeroo danda'u ni godha.
He has a life.	Jireenya qaba.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
They just want to be teachers.	Barsiisaa ta'uu qofa barbaadu.
He, of course, knows exactly where the problem lies.	Inni, rakkoon sun eessa akka jiru sirriitti akka beeku beekamaadha.
He wants us to do this.	Kana akka goonu barbaada.
To do these things.	Wantoota kana hojjechuuf.
It seems too simple.	Garmalee salphaa fakkaata.
I didn’t want to play anymore.	Kana booda taphachuu hin barbaanne.
Maybe he'll be right this time.	Tarii yeroo kana sirrii ta'a.
It went really well.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'ee deeme.
Wrong.	Dogoggora.
That's how we have it.	Akkasitti qabna.
We need to have something with the feel of a car.	Waan miira konkolaataa qabu qabaachuu qabna.
Something like that, though.	Waan akkasii garuu.
They say you are doing well.	Gaarii hojjechaa jirta jedhu.
Of all that they were.	Waan turan hundumaa keessaa.
It had to work for him.	Isaaf hojjechuu qaba ture.
It didn’t even seem real.	Dhugaa illee hin fakkaatu ture.
I hadn’t thought of it that much.	Hanga kana hin yaadne ture.
You're not there.	Ati hin jirtu.
You have to see them.	Isaan arguu qabda.
I want it to work well.	Akka gaariitti akka hojjetu nan barbaada.
I could work out.	Hojii hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture.
What did you do at your job today?.	Har'a hojii kee irratti maal goote?.
Now, that was the year.	Amma, sun bara ture.
Clearly, that is the case.	Akkas akka jiru ifaadha.
Not if we can help it.	Yoo gargaaruu dandeenyu miti.
We just can’t do anything with him in here.	As keessa isa waliin homaa hojjechuu qofa hin dandeenyu.
It was late in the afternoon.	Yeroon isaa waaree booda ture.
Wait for them.	Isaan eegaa.
So just too good.	Kanaaf garmalee gaarii qofa.
He wasn't sure of the timing.	Yeroo isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Many are not accurate.	Baay'een sirrii miti.
Tomorrow is my day.	Boru guyyaa kooti.
It’s not really obvious.	Dhuguma ifa miti.
And I came.	Anis dhufe.
You're not big enough.	Ati guddaa gahaa miti.
A lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee.
In my father and mother.	Abbaa koo fi haadha koo keessatti.
They work in making our lives easier.	Jireenya keenya salphaa gochuu keessatti hojjetu.
I told him not to talk.	Anis akka hin dubbanne itti hime.
Two years, maybe three.	Waggaa lama, tarii sadii.
I don't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himu.
He had a pretty good idea of ​​what this meant.	Kun maal jechuu akka ta'e yaada baay'ee gaarii qaba ture.
He could have access to everything now.	Waan hundumaa amma argachuu danda'a ture.
What do you think was going on?	Maaltu deemaa ture jettanii yaaddu?
These were his own.	Isaan kun kan isaa turan.
You have a good job.	Hojii gaarii qabda.
Not much, maybe, but some.	Baay'ee miti, tarii, garuu tokko tokko.
You are not my father.	Ati abbaa koo miti.
He had them.	Isaan qaba ture.
This really goes for me.	Kun dhuguma naaf deema.
He needs a proper home.	Mana sirrii taʼe isa barbaachisa.
It doesn't happen, though.	Hin ta'u garuu.
But you don't.	Ati garuu hin gootu.
This time, it really, really matters.	Yeroo kana, dhuguma, dhuguma dhimma qaba.
I was pretty sure about that.	Waa'ee kanaa baay'een mirkanaa'aa ture.
You are always in my thoughts in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti yeroo hundumaa yaada koo keessa jirta.
A lonely man.	Nama kophaa ta'e.
I must be the one.	Ani ta'uu qaba.
You know what you are.	Maal akka taate beekta.
You know you can do it.	Akka dandeessu beekta.
Spot .	Bakka .
So much, the whole eating thing.	Kanaaf baay'ee, waan nyaachuu guutuu.
No one wants the truth.	Namni dhugaa barbaadu hin jiru.
I am not of myself here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana asitti of hin jiru.
None are around.	Tokkollee naannoo hin jiru.
I can't tell you when.	Yoom akka ta'e sitti himuu hin danda'u.
A devoted husband.	Abbaa manaa of kenne.
It must be someone else.	Nama biraa ta'uu qaba.
About you, about me.	Waa'ee kee, waa'ee koo.
Good to walk around that area.	Naannoo sanatti deemuun gaarii.
But when this happened, he was in a different state.	Garuu yeroo kun ta'u haala biraa keessa ture.
It was easier now.	Amma salphaa ture.
I'm not.	Ani ta'e.
Maybe you are.	Tarii ati jirtu ta'a.
All day long.	Guyyaa guutuu.
No one really does.	Dhuguma namni godhu hin jiru.
I want you to leave.	Akka deemtu nan barbaada.
There is no such thing inside.	Keessatti wanti akkasii hin jiru.
He looked at his father.	Abbaa isaa ilaale.
I don’t know how to do this.	Kana akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
It hasn’t always worked out so well.	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti gaarii hin taane.
Sometimes we have to be wrong.	Yeroo tokko tokko dogoggora ta'uu qabna.
I think this is mostly true.	Kun irra caalaa dhugaa natti fakkaata.
He is not a morning person.	Nama ganama miti.
One, two, many.	Tokko, lama, hedduu.
But I was happy.	Garuu gammadeera.
It was her great opportunity.	Carraa ishee guddaa ture.
I wouldn’t have liked it.	Ani hin jaalladhu ture.
It was a good place to do the job.	Bakka hojii sana hojjechuuf gaarii ture.
No one is around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin jiru.
I knew it was going to happen.	Akka ta'uuf jiru nan beeka ture.
This was a good thing, he told himself.	Kun waan gaarii ture jedhee ofitti hime.
You are absolutely right about this.	Waa'ee kanaa guutummaatti sirrii dha.
Everyone here doesn’t have to talk about it.	Hundi as jiru waa’ee isaa dubbachuu hin qabu.
It took him three days.	Guyyaa sadii itti fudhate.
He would have been looking for a way.	Silaa karaa barbaadaa ture.
Love this guy.	Gurbaa kana jaalladhu.
Hopefully he can go home soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti gara manaatti deebi'uu akka danda'u abdii qabna.
I love this so much.	Kana baay'een jaalladha.
He had a bad one.	Hamaa qaba ture.
But, this isn’t that bad.	Garuu, kun hangas hamaa miti.
I love her and I don’t want to go.	Ani ishee jaalladha malee deemuu hin barbaadu.
I know you now.	Amma si beeka.
He doesn't think about it.	Inni itti hin yaadu.
You don’t do that.	Ati akkas hin gootu.
In about a month.	Gara ji'a tokko keessatti.
You know why you need it.	Maaliif akka si barbaachisu beekta.
That's better.	Akkasitti wayya.
Yours and yours and yours.	Kan kee fi kan kee fi kan kee.
He has no idea what he is doing is wrong.	Wanti inni hojjetu dogoggora ta'uu isaa yaada hin qabu.
Can you still eat it?	Ammallee nyaachuu dandeessaa?
It could be weeks.	Torban hedduu taʼuu dandaʼa.
He may have been wrong, but he thought he was right.	Dogoggora ta'uu danda'a, garuu sirrii ta'ee itti fakkaate.
That's how I love you.	Akkasitti si jaalladha.
But they weren’t enough.	Garuu isaan gahaa hin turre.
I am not like everyone else.	Ani akka nama hundumaa miti.
Then he went out.	Sana booda ba'e.
Look at what he is doing.	Waan inni hojjechaa jiru ilaalaa.
I don't mean it.	Ani jechuu koo miti.
What happened, happened.	Wanti ta'e, ta'e.
Everything else was excellent.	Wanti biraa hundi baayyee gaarii ture.
There was a time when even he was into her.	Yeroon inni illee ishee keessa ture tokko ture.
I don't know if it's us.	Nu ta'uu hin beeku.
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
That says something.	Sun waan tokko jedha.
He is going towards him.	Gara isaatti deemaa jira.
They were in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa turan.
I am no longer there.	Ani kana booda hin jiru.
Nothing seemed to matter.	Wanti dhimma qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
We were, to some extent.	Turre, hanga tokko.
Who would think that, all that money and everything.	Eenyu akkas jedhee yaadu, maallaqa sana hunda fi waan hundumaa.
But there was nothing she could do.	Garuu wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
People really want this.	Namoonni dhuguma kana barbaadu.
That wasn’t true.	Sun dhugaa hin turre.
I wanted to be real with you.	Si waliin dhugaa ta'uu barbaade.
I will be that guy.	Ani gurbaa sana ta'a.
Just books, books, books and pictures.	Kitaaba, kitaaba, kitaaba fi suuraa qofa.
It was her house.	Mana ishee ture.
As if it were	Akka waan .
I want to know what is going on here.	Asitti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaada.
But she didn't speak.	Isheen garuu hin dubbanne.
But there is still reason for optimism.	Garuu ammas sababni abdii namatti ta'u jira.
You have it.	Ati qabda.
It's still good.	Ammas gaarii dha.
But this is not the joke.	Garuu qoosaa kun miti.
This happens quite often.	Kun yeroo baay’ee ni ta’a.
He is still there.	Ammallee achi jira.
I care about you.	Ani waa'ee siif yaada.
Inside she had a feeling something was wrong.	Keessa isheen wanti tokko dogoggora ta'uu isaa miira qabdi turte.
How does that work? 	Sun akkamitti hojjeta?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I want to know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaada.
I have to say.	Jechuun qaba.
Now he had one.	Amma tokko qaba ture.
He obviously doesn’t have time.	Yeroo akka hin qabne ifaadha.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
People know him for his ideas, if nothing else.	Namoonni yaada isaatiin isa beeku, yoo waan biraa hin taane.
We can’t have that.	Sana qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
He was absolutely right.	Inni guutummaatti sirrii ture.
Maybe she was right.	Tarii isheen sirrii turte ta'a.
You have time.	Yeroo qabda.
Someone must.	Namni tokko dirqama.
Still no one is there.	Ammas namni tokkollee hin jiru.
We worked together all afternoon.	Waaree booda guutuu waliin hojjenne.
But he knew it was.	Garuu akka ta'e beeka ture.
None of it was needed.	Tokkollee hin barbaachifne.
I saw him, too.	Anis isa arge.
I have nothing bad to say about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan hamaa jedhu hin qabu.
It couldn't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeenye.
Our little house.	Mana keenya xiqqoo.
If it mattered what the reason was, they would look very different.	Osoo sababni isaa maal akka ta’e barbaachisaa ta’ee baay’ee adda fakkaatu turan.
Among them	Isaan keessaa
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
Clearly, there must be.	Jiraachuu akka qabu ifaadha.
He said he is still working on his book.	Ammas kitaaba isaa irratti hojjechaa akka jiru dubbateera.
But today's is different.	Garuu kan har'a adda.
While she can't get much out of it they might.	Osoo isheen waan baay'ee irraa argachuu hin dandeenye ta'uu danda'u.
They were so wrong.	Isaan baay'ee dogoggora turan.
But perhaps that would be fine.	Tarii garuu sun gaarii taʼa.
I am trying this again.	Kana ammas yaalaa jira.
But we need to know.	Garuu beekuu qabna.
But that’s not how it works.	Garuu akkasitti hin hojjetu.
There is nothing more.	Kana caalaa wanti jiru hin jiru.
They’re loud enough, of course.	Isaan sagalee gahaa qabu, beekamaadha.
I think that’s one thing.	Sun waan tokko jedhee yaada.
We stayed here a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa as turre.
Everyone accepted my idea.	Namni hundi yaada koo fudhate.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Garuu tarii sun waan gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
No two moments in time are alike.	Yeroo keessatti yeroon lama wal hin fakkaatu.
I knew why, I said.	Maaliif jedheen beeka ture.
None of them are there.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
The problem is that’s just not true.	Rakkoon jiru sun dhugaa miti qofa.
People are different in the book.	Kitaaba keessatti namoonni adda adda.
But it will be good.	Garuu gaarii ta'a.
Maybe it's all of those.	Tarii warra sana hunda ta'uu danda'a.
I think she has a lot to offer.	Waan baay'ee waan qabdu natti fakkaata.
It got really big.	Dhuguma guddaa ta'e.
I like this very much.	Kana baayyee natti tola.
I couldn't see who it was, but someone was there.	Eenyu akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye, garuu namni tokko achi ture.
That was it, not anymore.	Kanuma ture, kana booda miti.
I think of my room.	Kutaa koo nan yaada.
We can certainly find her if we want to.	Yoo barbaanne ishee argachuu akka dandeenyu beekamaadha.
You have to come right.	Sirriitti dhufuu qabda.
I have no idea how you do it.	Akkamitti akka gootu yaada hin qabu.
It looks really great.	Dhuguma guddaa fakkaata.
I love it so much.	Ani baay'een jaalladha.
Maybe his favorite has a good voice.	Tarii inni jaallatu sagalee gaarii qaba.
He did a great, great job.	Hojii guddaa, guddaa hojjete.
You probably weren’t.	Ati tarii hin turre.
I don't mean that.	Akkas jechuu koo miti.
There was no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin turre.
Tell me about your career.	Waa'ee hojii kee natti himi.
That's what happened.	Kan ta'e kanuma ture.
Not so this time.	Yeroo kana akkas miti.
He goes right on.	Inni sirriitti deema.
And it still exists.	Ammas ni jira.
There is no other.	Kan biraa hin jiru.
A lot of things.	Waan baay'ee.
Just the two of us.	Nu lamaan qofa.
One whole day with you.	Guyyaa tokko guutuu si waliin ta'uu.
I’m happy with my way.	Karaa kootti gammadeera.
It could never work.	Gonkumaa hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
He had hope.	Abdii qaba ture.
He could have let himself go.	Of dhiisuu danda'a ture.
Who we are.	Nuti eenyu akka taane.
It didn’t happen.	Hin taane.
He found a way.	Karaa argate.
It won't be long.	Dheeraa hin ta'u.
He apologized to me.	Dhiifama na gaafate.
It was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ture.
She's not good enough.	Isheen gaarii miti.
He should have seen that coming.	Silaa dhufuu sana arguu qaba ture.
I don't know who did it.	Eenyu akka godhe hin beeku.
What they want to do.	Waan hojjechuu barbaadu.
I really can't do it right now.	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kana gochuu hin danda'u.
Right then, right there.	Yeroo sanatti, sirriitti achitti.
So he seemed interested.	Kanaaf waan fedhii qabu fakkaata ture.
You know this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekta.
I just don’t know how to do that.	Akkamitti akkas akka godhu qofa hin beeku.
That’s my issue.	Sun dhimma kooti.
That's how we meet.	Akkasitti wal arguu.
No one should know.	Namni beeku hin qabu.
Sooner than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa dafee.
This has never happened before.	Kun kanaan dura ta’ee hin beeku.
Sometimes I met their eyes.	Yeroo tokko tokko ija isaanii waliin wal arge.
But it’s not a bad feeling.	Garuu miira hamaa miti.
It won't be easy.	Salphaa hin ta'u.
I couldn’t see anything.	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
Again, we are all human.	Ammas hundi keenya nama.
It was complete.	Guutuu ture.
It was everything about him, really.	Waa'ee isaa wanti hundi ture, dhuguma.
We have two rooms .	Kutaa lama qabna .
Yours, however.	Kan keessan garuu.
Which probably exists.	Kan tarii jiraachuu hin oolu.
I wondered what they would be.	Maal ta'u jedheen yaade.
I know what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e nan beeka.
There could have been, of course.	Silaa jiraachuu danda’a ture, beekamaadha.
I can never really get it.	Dhuguma gonkumaa argachuu hin danda'u.
It was happening again.	Ammas ta'aa ture.
I think maybe I should get some help.	Tarii gargaarsa tokko tokko argachuu qaba jedheen yaada.
I can't do any more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin danda'u.
I saw her, really.	Ishee arge, dhuguma.
He hadn’t done any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne ture.
As in, one.	Akkuma keessa, tokko.
If he wants to see me, he knows the way.	Yoo na arguu barbaade karaa beeka.
I knew him well enough.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka ture.
Obviously something is wrong with the car.	Konkolaataa irratti wanti tokko dogoggora akka jiru ifaadha.
It seemed to go over very well.	Baayyee gaarii waan darbe fakkaata ture.
Anymore.	Kana caalaa.
One two, one two.	Tokko lama, tokko lama.
Where were you?	Eessa turte?
That will have to be done.	Sun gochuun dirqama ta'a.
This was last month.	Kun ji'a darbe ture.
Perhaps there is another reason.	Tarii sababni biraa jira.
He can do anything.	Waan hundumaa gochuu danda'a.
It needs to be worked on.	Itti hojjechuu barbaachisa.
It’s time.	Yeroo dha.
We did not see each other very often.	Yeroo baayʼee wal hin argine.
They were here the whole time.	Yeroo guutuu as turan.
It came many times.	Yeroo baayyee dhufe.
But and therefore.	Garuu fi kanaaf.
But I can tell you this.	Kana garuu sitti himuu nan danda'a.
It was before this.	Kanaan dura ture.
You now have three children.	Amma ijoollee sadii qabda.
He knew he had a good time.	Yeroo gaarii qabu beeka ture.
Not everyone has to do both.	Namni hundi lamaan isaanii hojjechuu hin qabu.
I hope it works.	Akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
It doesn’t have a date.	Guyyaa hin qabu.
Right here at home.	Sirriitti as mana keessatti.
But this time he was not alone.	Yeroo kana garuu kophaa isaa hin turre.
There really should be more of the two.	Dhuguma lamaan isaanii caalaa jiraachuu qaba.
Maybe you should go with him?	Tarii isa waliin deemuu qabda ta'a?
This is what's different.	Wanti adda ta'e kana.
But then, for him, maybe it is.	Garuu sana booda, isaaf, tarii ni ta'a.
It works in very few cases.	Haala baayyee muraasa keessatti ni hojjeta.
So it must be true.	Kanaaf dhugaa ta'uu qaba.
Not one that anyone can see.	Kan namni tokkollee arguu danda'u tokkollee miti.
Not exactly, of course.	Sirriitti miti, beekamaadha.
I think this is a good time.	Yeroon kun gaarii natti fakkaata.
He got three years for it.	Waggaa sadii itti argate.
People had their issues.	Namoonni dhimma isaanii qaban turan.
Always.	Yeroo hunda.
Just back me up, please.	Na duubatti deebi'uu qofa maaloo.
Maybe it doesn't matter.	Tarii homaa hin qabu ta'a.
That’s the only reason we do it.	Sababni itti goonu kanuma qofa.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
No one seemed sure.	Namni mirkanaa'aa hin fakkaatu ture.
Throughout the year.	Waggaa guutuu.
I didn't know that.	Ani kana hin beeku ture.
I am very interested.	Ani fedhii guddaa qaba.
It has a great sound.	Sagalee guddaa qaba.
Tom was looking for a new job.	Toomin hojii haaraa barbaadaa ture.
I want her here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana as ishee barbaada.
She didn’t need that.	Sana ishee hin barbaachifne.
He is my life.	Inni jireenya kooti.
He lives alone now.	Amma kophaa jiraata.
Look at her teacher.	Barsiisaa ishee ilaalaa.
He must be a nice, helpful person.	Nama gaarii, nama gargaaru ta’uu qaba.
And it’s still the same.	Ammas kanuma.
Pretty much the same thing, really.	Baay'ee waan tokko, dhuguma.
We are the same.	Nuti wal fakkaata.
None of it was anything I would say.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee wanti ani jedhu hin turre.
Not for you, but for you.	Siif osoo hin taane siif.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Waa'ee koo waan hundumaa akka beeku nan beeka ture.
He said it again.	Ammas jedheen.
We both are, apparently.	Lamaan keenyayyuu jirra, fakkaata.
It can help you.	Si gargaaruu danda'a.
I wasn’t sure who did it.	Eenyu akka godhe mirkanaa’aa hin turre.
I can see that in you.	Sana si keessatti arguu nan danda'a.
No one really knows.	Dhuguma namni beeku hin jiru.
But it never seemed right.	Garuu gonkumaa sirrii hin fakkaatu ture.
It was always great.	Yeroo hundumaa guddaa ture.
We made a lot of mistakes.	Dogoggora hedduu hojjenne.
We have a job.	Hojii qabna.
This was completely different.	Kun guutummaatti adda ture.
She had a wide range of interests.	Fedhii bal’aa qabdi turte.
So that shouldn't be an issue.	Kanaaf sun dhimma ta'uu hin qabu.
Let him do whatever he wants.	Waan barbaade akka hojjetu gochuu.
He should know.	Beekuu qaba.
I think they can do that.	Isaan kana gochuu danda'u jedheen yaada.
I couldn't say anything.	Homaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
We need to help each other.	Wal gargaaruu qabna.
You know it doesn’t work that way.	Akkasitti akka hin hojjenne ni beekta.
That certainly wasn’t the worst thing.	Sun waan hunda caalaa hamaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I still can't believe it.	Ammallee amanuu hin danda'u.
We have a dog.	Saree qabna.
He wanted to be with her.	Ishee waliin ta'uu barbaade.
He wants me.	Inni barbaadu ana dha.
I think they could do nothing but help us.	Nu gargaaruu malee homaa gochuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
His little daughter.	Intala isaa xiqqoo.
One other thing.	Waan biraa tokko.
Mine went extremely well.	Kan koo garmalee gaarii ta'ee deeme.
But you never know.	Garuu gonkumaa hin beektu.
Otherwise pretty much the same.	Yoo kana hin taane baay'ee wal fakkaata.
This is not the same.	Kun tokko miti.
I passed them by.	Anis isaan bira darbe.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta, yeroo tokko tokko hin ta'u.
He knew exactly why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti beeka ture.
But it could be the other way around.	Garuu karaa biraa ta’uu danda’a.
I hope this is not a mistake.	Kun dogoggora akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
But we have to give it a chance.	Garuu carraa kennuu qabna.
What does that look like.	Sun maal fakkaata.
You just have to tell me something about yourself.	Waa'ee kee waan tokko natti himuu qofa qabda.
I thought you should know.	Beekuu qabda jedheen yaade.
I couldn’t recognize them.	Isaan beekuu hin dandeenye.
But there were no people.	Garuu namoonni hin turre.
The good he has done will live on.	Gaarii inni hojjete ni jiraata.
But it’s not always right.	Garuu yeroo hunda sirrii miti.
We were just waiting.	Eegaa qofa turre.
This is not a mistake.	Kun dogoggora miti.
Rarely more than today.	Har'a caalaa yeroo muraasaaf amma.
I wanted to do something big.	Waan guddaa hojjechuu barbaade.
But he doesn't.	Inni garuu hin godhu.
It couldn't have been easy.	Salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
Tell me what happened.	Waan ta'e natti himi.
It was a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa ture.
But it didn't matter much.	Garuu baay'ee dhimma hin qabu ture.
He didn’t understand.	Inni hin galle.
I can know him.	Isa beekuu danda'a.
I am glad I did this.	Kana gochuu kootti gammadeera.
Just for you.	Siif qofa.
I really like him a lot.	Dhuguma baay'een isa jaalladha.
That can't be!	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u!
It wasn't much.	Baay'ee hin turre.
Not sure how it all works.	Hundi akkamitti akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa miti.
They still have to be.	Ammas ta’uu qabu.
I really couldn’t.	Dhuguma hin dandeenye.
But that was not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas hin turre.
We need a house first.	Dura mana nu barbaachisa.
When I do it that way, it doesn't work, it just doesn't matter.	Yeroon akkasitti godhu hin hojjetu, homaa hin ta'u qofa.
Then just her eyes.	Sana booda ija ishee qofa.
They were waiting for something to happen	Waan tokko ta'u eegaa turan
We’re not the only ones.	Nu qofa miti.
You would need it.	Si barbaachisa silaa.
With you inside.	Isin keessa waliin.
He knows their language.	Afaan isaanii ni beeka.
She didn’t know what to think.	Waan yaaddu hin beektu turte.
There wasn't much noise.	Sagalee baay'ee hin turre.
. . . .	.
Please more, more.	Mee caalaatti, caalaa.
It’s not entirely clear why he wants this.	Maaliif akka kana barbaadu guutummaatti ifa miti.
It certainly wasn’t.	Akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I was alone the whole time.	Yeroo sana hunda kophaa koo ture.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
You will never walk alone.	Yoomiyyuu kophaa kee hin deemtu.
He wasn't sure.	Inni mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But it's not about that.	Garuu waa'ee kanaa miti.
Nothing else will come.	Wanti biraa hin dhufu.
I have no feeling for it.	Miira tokkollee itti hin qabu.
They were certainly alone.	Kophaa isaanii akka turan beekamaadha.
Why are they doing this?	Maaliif kana gochaa jiru?
The problem still exists.	Rakkoon jiru ammallee jira.
I know it.	Ani beeka.
No one was watching.	Namni ilaalaa ture hin turre.
I wanted to do something that didn’t.	Waan akkas hin goone hojjechuu barbaade.
There is no time like the present.	Yeroon akka ammaa hin jiru.
They had a whole house of children.	Guutuu mana ijoollee qaban turan.
But he did it.	Inni garuu ni godhe.
You need to know something.	Waan tokko beekuu qabda.
Maybe he was waiting for someone.	Tarii nama eegaa ture ta'a.
Now, you have my answer.	Amma, deebii koo qabda.
A lot had happened, and a lot more was yet to happen.	Waan baay'een ta'ee ture, ammas waan baay'een ta'uu qaba ture.
She holds his hand.	Harka isaa qabdi.
She was a little bit.	Isheen xiqqoo turte.
Then he went out.	Sana booda ba'e.
I was very happy at home.	Mana keessatti baay'een gammade.
It always works.	Yeroo hunda hojjeta.
Except when it doesn’t.	Yeroo hin taane malee.
Many things.	Waan hedduu.
I have no idea what to do with those either.	Warra sana illee maal akka gootu yaada hin qabu.
That is the most important thing.	Sun waan hundumaa caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
It was probably hers.	Kan ishee ta'uu hin oolu.
On their own, of course.	Ofii isaanii irratti, beekamaadha.
Not just before.	Dura qofa miti.
The sound of his voice.	Sagalee sagalee isaa.
It requires ideas.	Yaada barbaada.
On the up and up in her career.	Hojii ishee keessatti ol fi ol irratti.
That’s how they know each other.	Akkasitti wal beeku.
I wasn't sure it would ever happen, though not completely.	Guutummaatti osoo hin taane yoomiyyuu akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
There are no other people you know.	Namoonni biraa ati beektu hin jiru.
Not on one day.	Guyyaa tokko irratti miti.
I am a good girl.	Ani intala gaarii dha.
I knew she wanted time with him.	Yeroo isa waliin akka barbaaddu nan beeka ture.
It required a lot of commitment.	Waadaa guddaa barbaada ture.
You could have done nothing then.	Yeroo sanatti silaa homaa gochuu hin dandeessu turte.
So they know what it is.	Kanaaf maal akka ta'e ni beeku.
He has no children of his own.	Ijoollee ofii hin qabu.
He took a big risk.	Balaa guddaa fudhate.
Why, he thought.	Maaliif jedhee yaade.
I went through a lot.	Waan baay'ee keessa darbe.
But he doesn't do that.	Garuu akkas hin godhu.
You have a handle.	Qabduu qabda.
I have been in many of them.	Isaan keessaa hedduu keessa tureera.
I know it sounds like a simple problem.	Rakkoo salphaa akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
You can see it here, here, and here.	Asitti, asitti, fi asitti arguu dandeessu.
This is the person we were looking for.	Nama barbaadaa turre kana.
Desire in this case.	Fedhii dhimma kana keessatti.
It's almost too late.	Yeroo booda jechuun ni danda'ama.
But it was different for us.	Nuuf garuu adda ture.
There was no problem.	Rakkoon tokkollee hin turre.
So he got a new job.	Kanaaf hojii haaraa argate.
I don’t understand these people.	Namoota kana naaf hin galle.
He was a boy.	Inni gurbaa ture.
I don't want to know anything.	Ani homaa beekuu hin barbaadu.
I told him I loved him.	Anis akkan isa jaalladhu itti hime.
What does it do.	Maal hojjeta.
I know this is right.	Kun sirrii akka ta'e nan beeka.
What do we have here?	Asitti maal qabna?
But no one saw it but the two of us.	Garuu nu lamaan malee namni arge hin turre.
He had it in the house.	Mana keessatti qaba ture.
I only have one today.	Har'a tokko qofa qaba.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
It wasn’t looking good.	Gaarii fakkaatu hin turre.
He didn't talk much to anyone.	Namatti baay'ee hin dubbanne.
The problem is just too big.	Rakkoon jiru baayyee guddaa qofa.
That's not my problem, as he was doing perfectly fine.	Sun rakkoo koo miti, akkuma inni guutummaatti gaarii hojjechaa ture.
He’s just a great guy.	Inni gurbaa guddaa qofa.
He still got what he needed.	Ammas waan barbaachisu argate.
I knew it then.	Yeroo sanatti nan beeka ture.
Part of it is.	Kutaa isaa tokko.
But it doesn’t need to be that way.	Garuu akkas ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
A year ago it would not have happened.	Waggaa tokko dura silaa hin ta'u ture.
But that’s not my business.	Garuu sun dhimma koo miti.
Keep your house.	Mana keessan eegaa.
They were just real people.	Isaan namoota dhugaa qofa turan.
I don't have that much time.	Yeroo hangas hin qabu.
I was happy with myself.	Ofitti gammadeera.
She's not very big.	Isheen baayyee guddaa miti.
I can't tell anyone.	Namatti himuu hin danda'u.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
That didn’t seem like an important question.	Sun gaaffii barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu ture.
I thought that was terrible.	Sun waan hamaa natti fakkaate.
Do you have time?	Yeroo qabduu?
You know better than that.	Kana caalaa ati beekta.
And he did so.	Akkas godhe.
This shouldn't be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu.
But today she doesn't look very good.	Har'a garuu baayyee gaarii hin fakkaattu.
This is certainly not true.	Kun dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Perhaps I did not really know there.	Tarii dhuguma achitti hin beeku taʼa.
In that section.	Kutaa sana keessatti.
The reason we cannot know.	Sababni nuti beekuu hin dandeenyu.
He wasn’t like that.	Inni akkas hin turre.
We met a little bit.	Waan xiqqoo wal argine.
We can’t do that.	Akkas gochuu hin dandeenyu.
It’s my house.	Mana kooti.
I thought she was a good mother.	Haadha gaarii natti fakkaate.
I can't say what.	Maal jechuu hin danda'u.
He was one of us.	Inni nu keessaa tokko ture.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun miti.
He wasn’t there, though.	Inni garuu hin jiru ture.
I know a lot about you.	Waa'ee kee waan baay'ee beeka.
But not that night.	Garuu halkan sana miti.
They don’t have it yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin qaban.
They have no problems.	Rakkoo hin qaban.
I would have done it.	Silaa nan godha ture.
He didn’t do well.	Inni gaarii hin hojjenne.
None of the kids did.	Ijoollee keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo miti.
I was both of them.	Ani lamaan isaanii ture.
He is a newcomer.	Inni nama haaraa dha.
This should go quickly this time.	Kun yeroo kana dafee deemuu qaba.
But a lot of people are like me.	Garuu namoonni baay'een akka kooti.
It must be mine.	Kan koo ta'uu qaba.
I say this again here.	Kanaan asitti ammas jedha.
He may still be doing so.	Ammallee akkas gochaa jiraachuu dandaʼa.
This is what usually happens.	Yeroo baayyee waan ta'u kana.
But this is us.	Garuu kun nuti.
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
It wasn’t a good bit.	Xiqqoo gaarii hin turre.
He was sure he had found it.	Akka argate mirkanaa'aa ture.
But this time he was right.	Yeroo kana garuu sirrii ture.
If you are into that.	Yoo sana keessa jirta ta'e.
It was his money.	Maallaqa isaa ture.
But it couldn't have been easy.	Garuu salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I know that's something.	Sun waan tokko akka ta'e nan beeka.
I think we have.	Qabne natti fakkaata.
One of them was a man.	Isaan keessaa tokko nama ture.
It’s not their place.	Bakka isaanii miti.
We’re the only ones.	Nuti qofa.
Too much commitment, perhaps.	Garmalee of kennuu, tarii.
But there was no time.	Garuu yeroon hin turre.
Except for the girl.	Intala malee.
It wasn’t too much.	Garmalee hin turre.
I can't buy this.	Kana bitachuu hin danda'u.
I think it was true.	Dhugaa ture natti fakkaata.
One day, if you must go, then you will know.	Guyyaa tokko, yoo deemuun dirqama ta'e, sana booda ni beekta.
Everything is in us.	Wanti hundi nu keessa jira.
he said, smirking.	jedheen.
That was obvious.	Sun ifa ture.
You will love them.	Isaan ni jaallattu.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
Wait a moment, please.	Yeroo muraasaaf eegaa maaloo.
He seemed to be.	Inni waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
I shouldn’t have said anything to my wife.	Silaa haadha manaa kootti homaa jechuu hin qabu ture.
But then he did.	Sana booda garuu ni godhe.
It was through time.	Karaa yeroo ture.
She didn't know what to think now.	Amma maal akka yaaddu hin beekne.
I still don’t do it.	Ammallee hin godhu.
You can definitely do this as you go along.	Akkuma deemtu kana gochuu akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
I was different, too.	Anis adda ture.
This is my opinion.	Kun yaada kooti.
I can't do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
It’s okay, you don’t need one.	Homaa miti, tokko si hin barbaachisu.
But that’s just my opinion.	Garuu sun yaada koo qofa.
It was as simple as that.	Akkuma sanaa salphaa ture.
There you have him.	Achitti isa qabda.
Always two.	Yeroo hunda lama.
But no one wanted to go.	Garuu namni deemuu barbaadu hin turre.
It’s just what’s needed.	Waan barbaachisu qofa.
Only, we have no idea how.	Qofa, akkamitti akka ta'e yaada hin qabnu.
It shouldn't have happened this time.	Yeroo kana ta'uu hin qabu ture.
They are still there.	Ammallee jiru.
I don't think so.	Natti hin fakkaatu.
I have everything in here.	Waan hundumaa as keessa qaba.
I have a lot to tell you.	Waan baay'een sitti himu qaba.
Once, twice, many times.	Yeroo tokko, lama, yeroo baay’ee.
But this was too late.	Kun garuu yeroo booda ture.
He didn’t say anything for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf homaa hin dubbanne.
I didn’t do any of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
That was a great man.	Sun nama guddaa ture.
No one understood him now.	Amma namni isa hubate hin jiru.
I couldn’t find him anymore.	Kana booda isa argachuu hin dandeenye.
He’s the guy in the car and through.	Inni gurbaa konkolaataa keessaa fi karaa.
Until she.	Hanga isheen.
I love it there.	Achitti baay'een jaalladha.
I don’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabu.
It was simple, but it worked.	Salphaa ture, garuu ni hojjeta ture.
Someone spoke to me.	Namni tokko natti dubbate.
That’s not really true.	Sun dhuguma dhugaa miti.
It would be a very big problem.	Rakkoo baayyee guddaa ta'a.
I couldn’t see anyone up there.	Achi ol nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
they may have.	qabaachuu danda'u.
Not that it should be.	Ta'uu qaba jechuu miti.
It's going to be a little while.	Yeroo xiqqoo ta'uuf jira.
We must do what is necessary.	Waan barbaachisu gochuu qabna.
But he didn't do anything.	Garuu homaa hin goone.
But it’s never, ever been true.	Garuu dhugaa ta’ee hin beeku, ta’ee hin beeku.
It was true.	Dhugaa ture.
This works fine.	Kun gaarii hojjeta.
It wasn’t a year.	Bara hin turre.
Maybe there is nothing.	Tarii homaa hin jiru ta'a.
I’m glad I did this job.	Hojii kana hojjechuu kootti gammadeera.
I'm going to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuuf deema.
We only do one thing for us.	Waan tokko qofa nuuf goonu.
I didn’t see that coming.	Sun dhufuu isaa hin argine.
I’d really rather not.	Dhuguma akka hin taane naaf wayya.
In this lifetime.	Jireenya kana keessatti.
He knew exactly what had happened, again.	Waan ta'e sirriitti beeka ture, ammas.
But if you don’t want to, you don’t have to.	Garuu yoo hin barbaanne dirqama hin qabdu.
It can't just be a joke.	Qoosaa qofa ta'uu hin danda'u.
It was now.	Amma ture.
You, not.	Kan, mana.
They will be soon enough.	Yeroo dhiyootti ni ta'u.
There's a lot going on.	Waan baay'ee deemaa jira.
You have to go.	Deemtu qabda.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
We are waiting.	Eegaa jirra.
I mean, nothing.	Homaa jechuu kooti.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
Couldn't do much more.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
You’re going to stay here.	Asitti turuuf jirta.
Where are they going?	Eessa deemaa jiru?
That was obvious.	Sun ifa ture.
I won't tell you again.	Ammas sitti hin himu.
He was the one.	Inni ture.
Maybe he had his reasons.	Tarii sababa isaa qaba ture ta'a.
They were a constant thing.	Isaan kun waan yeroo hundumaa turan.
No one can do that.	Namni akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
But we can only do this if we know.	Garuu kana gochuu kan dandeenyu yoo beekne qofa.
We were a little lighter.	Xiqqoo salphaa turre.
At the same time, there were problems at home.	Kanuma waliin mana keessatti rakkoon ture.
I was sure someone was out there, watching me.	Namni tokko achi ala, na ilaalaa akka jiru mirkanaa'aa ture.
But nothing like that happened.	Garuu wanti akkasii hin taane.
Of course, he saw nothing.	Homaa akka hin argine beekamaadha.
But I didn’t really know her.	Garuu dhuguma ishee hin beeku ture.
It looked a good amount.	Hamma gaarii fakkaata ture.
No one else was there, just.	Namni biraa achi hin turre, qofa.
we had a smile.	qabna turre.
But that doesn't seem to be happening here.	Garuu asitti sun waan ta'aa jiru hin fakkaatu.
Good stuff here.	Asitti waan gaarii.
But that's it.	Garuu kanuma.
This is my room.	Kun kutaa kooti.
This is absolutely correct.	Kun guutummaatti sirrii dha.
But no one is there.	Garuu namni achi hin jiru.
You can go back.	Deebi'uu dandeessa.
They were just children.	Ijoollee qofa turan.
I am the right person.	Ani nama sirrii dha.
Maybe it's both.	Tarii lamaan isaanii ta'uu danda'a.
That’s when he realized she was gone.	Yeroo sanatti akka isheen hin jirre hubate.
And yet he did nothing.	Ammas homaa hin goone.
I had never seen anything like it.	Waan akkasii hin argine ture.
There is hope though.	Abdiin jira garuu.
Look at the picture.	Suuraa ilaalaa.
Now they can see clearly.	Amma sirriitti arguu ni danda'u.
I know he has one.	Tokko akka qabu nan beeka.
But it’s not enough.	Garuu gahaa miti.
Little do you know that it is much worse than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa baayʼee hamaa akka taʼe hin beektu.
Maybe they're right.	Tarii sirrii ta'uu danda'u.
You are my wife, not his.	Ati haadha manaa kooti malee kan isaa miti.
Look at my father.	Abbaa koo ilaalaa.
I wondered why he asked me.	Maaliif na gaafate jedheen yaade.
I couldn't see the way.	Karaa arguu hin dandeenye.
You have two months.	Ji'a lama qabda.
I can't do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
Just one of you guys.	Isin keessaa tokko qofa.
He didn’t do the accident.	Balaa sana hin hojjenne.
We had them there yesterday.	Kaleessa achitti isaan qabna turre.
She was not alone this time.	Yeroo kana kophaa ishee hin turre.
Not much, but a little.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane xiqqoo.
We are, indeed.	Nuti, dhuguma.
It's still on.	Ammas irra jira.
I want you too much.	Garmalee si barbaada.
But it wasn't like that, wasn't it.	Garuu akkas hin turre turee, akkas hin turre.
She didn't know much.	Waan hedduu hin beekne turte.
It seemed too much.	Garmalee waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
Tell me about your mother.	Waa'ee haadha kee natti himi.
Not better, not better.	Hin wayya, hin wayya.
We have a great voice.	Sagalee guddaa qabna.
I don’t think we can.	Nuti waan dandeenyu natti hin fakkaatu.
So it's in somewhere.	Kanaaf bakka tokko keessa jira.
Good luck from someone who was there.	Nama achi ture irraa carraa gaarii.
It looked like a house.	Mana fakkaata ture.
But a couple of things.	Garuu waan tokko lama.
They will do whatever it takes.	Waan barbaachisu hunda ni hojjetu.
There was nothing more to say.	Kana caalaa wanti jedhu hin turre.
I wanted to do more.	Caalaatti hojjechuu barbaade.
But it doesn’t seem to be working.	Garuu waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
It may be necessary.	Barbaachisaa ta’uu danda’a.
I can't do any more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin danda'u.
How can this be possible.	Kun akkamitti ta'uu danda'a.
For a moment everything was different.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti hundi adda ta'e.
He is right.	Inni sirrii dha.
Nothing major at all.	Homaa guddaa tokkollee hin jiru.
I don’t have a picture book.	Kitaaba suuraa hin qabu.
You don’t know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu hin beektu.
But otherwise it was pretty much the same.	Garuu yoo kana hin taane baay'ee wal fakkaata ture.
But in this case he was wrong.	Garuu dhimma kana irratti dogoggora ture.
What's that going to be.	Maal ta'a sun.
His wife's house.	Mana haadha manaa isaa.
You can’t do this anymore.	Kana booda kana gochuu hin dandeessu.
What can any of them say to this? 	Isaan keessaa tokkollee kanaaf maal jechuu danda’a?
I thought it was bad.	Hamaa natti fakkaate.
You have this.	Kana qabda.
He has a good job, so there’s that.	Hojii gaarii qaba, kanaaf sun jira.
I know it doesn’t work.	Akka hin hojjenne nan beeka.
So two things.	Kanaaf waan lama.
I don't think this is right.	Kun sirrii natti hin fakkaatu.
No one asked me.	Namni na gaafate hin jiru.
Maybe he’s right.	Tarii inni sirrii dha.
I have no problem with this.	Kanaan rakkoo hin qabu.
She had to admit, she didn't look like herself.	Isheen amanuu qabdi turte, ofii ishee hin fakkaattu turte.
A very serious situation.	Haala baayyee hamaa ta'e.
You would never think of it but you do.	Silaa gonkumaa hin yaaddu turte garuu ni yaada.
Always .	Yeroo hundumaa .
There was no one in the room.	Kutaa sana keessa namni tokkollee hin turre.
This is a new era.	Kun bara haaraa dha.
My life, his life.	Jireenya koo, jireenya isaa.
Clearly, that was the case.	Akkas akka ture ifaadha.
It just has to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu qofa qaba.
Maybe you can help.	Tarii gargaaruu dandeessa.
I just have a really bad feeling about it.	Ani waa'ee kanaa miira dhuguma hamaa qofa qaba.
It would never have worked.	Silaa gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
If it doesn't work .	Yoo hin hojjenne .
He is not a new person.	Nama haaraa miti.
Places we could never go with our parents.	Bakka warra keenya waliin gonkumaa deemuu hin dandeenye.
But this year is a bit different.	Garuu bara kana xiqqoo adda.
He loves her.	Ishee ni jaallata.
She was in a terrible situation.	Haala hamaa keessa turte.
I wouldn't have known.	Silaa hin beeku ture.
So it’s better not to tell anyone.	Kanaaf namatti himuu dhiisuu wayya.
She said get your life back.	Jireenya kee deebi'i jettee turte.
It is not necessary to say.	Jechuun dirqama miti.
He has a daughter.	Intala tokko qaba.
About my feelings.	Waa'ee miira koo.
I know it sounds that way, but it’s not true.	Akkas akka fakkaatu nan beeka, garuu dhugaa miti.
I do in a lot of situations.	Haala baay’ee keessatti nan godha.
I know .	Ani beeka .
This is usually a good thing.	Yeroo baay’ee kun waan gaarii dha.
We barely had time.	Yeroo xiqqoo qofa qabna turre.
More than anything else.	Waan hundumaa caalaa.
No one should tell me.	Namni tokkollee natti himuu hin qabu.
All good so far.	Hundi hanga ammaatti gaarii dha.
He didn't go with anyone.	Nama waliin hin deemne.
She was very real.	Isheen baay'ee dhugaa turte.
Not exactly those things.	Wantoota sana sirriitti miti.
No one is home but me.	Ana malee namni mana jiru hin jiru.
He works as a teacher.	Barsiisaa ta'ee hojjeta.
No one should help him.	Namni isa gargaaruu hin qabu.
I didn't want to be one.	Ani tokko ta'uu hin barbaanne ture.
I think you have a problem.	Rakkoo qabdu natti fakkaata.
You are nothing without me.	Ana malee ati homaa miti.
Not everyone, exactly.	Nama hunda miti, sirriitti.
No one saw it coming.	Namni yeroo dhufu arge hin jiru.
We’re going to keep going.	Itti deemuuf jirra.
I don't know why this has to be the case.	Kun maaliif akkas ta'uu akka qabu hin beeku.
He is nothing anymore.	Inni kana booda homaa miti.
We are there today.	Har'a achi jirra.
I still can't believe it.	Ammas amanuu hin danda'u.
There wasn't much up there.	Achi ol waan baay'ee hin turre.
I don't want this to be just another one.	Kun kan biraa qofa akka ta'u hin barbaadu.
Just someone he knows.	Nama inni beeku qofa.
It could have been any of them.	Silaa isaan keessaa tokkollee ta’uu danda’a ture.
She has a favorite job.	Hojii jaallattu qabdi.
You can't go back anymore.	Kana booda duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
In both cases.	Haala lamaan keessatti.
Nothing was out of place.	Wanti bakka hin qabne hin turre.
This was a problem.	Kun rakkoo ture.
I’m still working on that.	Ammallee sana irratti hojjechaa jira.
She said sorry.	Dhiifama jette.
He was looking for someone.	Nama barbaadaa ture.
I need a room.	Kutaa na barbaachisa.
We can't stay.	Turuu hin dandeenyu.
I don’t want to see him again.	Ammas isa arguu hin barbaadu.
That wasn’t the case here.	Asitti akkas hin turre.
But nothing came of that idea.	Garuu yaada sana keessaa wanti dhufe hin jiru.
I'm sorry for you.	Siif dhiifama.
It could be worse, you know.	Kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a, beekta.
You may get errors.	Dogoggora argachuu dandeessa.
I'm sure you know about it.	Waa'ee isaa akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
He needed her space.	Bakka ishee barbaachisa ture.
I didn’t know you were here, in the house.	As akka jirtu hin beeku ture, mana keessa.
It would have been good for you.	Silaa gaarii siif ta'a ture.
But she never had it.	Isheen garuu gonkumaa hin qabdu turte.
My job was pretty simple.	Hojiin koo baayʼee salphaa ture.
I like that a lot.	Sun baayyee natti tola.
He was doing a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjechaa ture.
You just need to be yourself.	Of ta'uu qofa si barbaachisa.
He had to be something.	Inni waan tokko ta'uu qaba ture.
They will soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti ni godhu.
It was about now.	Waa'ee ammaa ture.
And that was what she needed again.	Ammas wanti ishee barbaachisu kanuma ture.
Really great house.	Dhuguma mana guddaa.
They’re not the only ones.	Isaan qofa miti.
It's for him.	Isaaf ta'a.
He always has time to help people.	Yeroo hundumaa namoota gargaaruuf yeroo qaba.
I thought you would want to know.	Beekuu ni barbaaddu jedheen yaade.
No one knows him today.	Har'a namni isa beeku hin jiru.
Time was yours, in life.	Yeroon kan kee ture, jireenya keessatti.
You don’t go up there anymore.	Kana booda achi ol hin deemtu.
New money in old hands.	Maallaqa haaraa harka durii keessa.
There is no clear right or wrong here.	Asitti sirrii fi dogoggora ifa ta’e hin jiru.
There's usually not much there.	Yeroo baayyee achitti waan baay'een hin jiru.
That 's it	Kanuma .
Inside me.	Keessa kootti.
Just like real life.	Akkuma jireenya dhugaa.
I'm working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa jira.
It was a good book.	Kitaaba gaarii ture.
He wasn’t clear on that.	Sana irratti ifa hin turre.
It looked like a good one.	Isa gaarii fakkaata ture.
You have to do more than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabda.
A promise of hope.	Waadaa abdii.
But it was a mistake.	Garuu dogoggora ture.
They know him very well, they love him.	Baay'ee isa beeku, isa jaallatu.
I can't really talk now.	Amma dhuguma dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Boy, are you good at this.	Gurbaa, ati kana irratti ga'umsa qabduu.
Everything has been pretty good for the most part.	Wanti hundi irra caalaa baayyee gaarii ta'ee jira.
I knew there was.	Akka jiru nan beeka ture.
I want her to walk us through it.	Akka isheen keessa nu deemtu nan barbaada.
Except for what he did.	Waan inni hojjete malee.
No one really knows.	Dhuguma namni beeku hin jiru.
I want to know more about this sound.	Waa'ee sagalee kanaa caalaatti beekuu barbaada.
You have to know.	Beekuu qabda.
But I have my thing.	Garuu waan koo qaba.
This was never the case.	Kun gonkumaa akkas hin turre.
Please get here.	Mee as gahaa.
Of course, that is not what happened.	Wanti taʼe akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But that's not what happened in the past.	Garuu yeroo darbe kan ta'e akkas miti.
But it was a mistake.	Garuu dogoggora ture.
We’re just playing.	Nuti taphachuu qofa.
Nothing quite like it.	Wanti guutummaatti kana fakkaatu hin jiru.
He knew something.	Waan tokko beeka ture.
But even this cannot be entirely accurate.	Garuu kun illee guutummaatti sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u.
I know this is not the case.	Kun akka hin taane nan beeka.
I can't be like them.	Ani akka isaanii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I want to do something, I want to be somebody.	Waan tokko hojjechuu barbaada, nama ta'uu barbaada.
I had to do that on mine.	Kan koo irratti akkas gochuun qaba ture.
I can't tell anyone.	Namatti himuu hin danda'u.
But now it doesn't.	Amma garuu hin ta'u.
We'll have to go to her.	Gara ishee deemuun dirqama ta'a.
I don’t even have to say anything else.	Waan biraa dubbachuu illee hin qabu.
Sounds like a fairly serious problem.	Rakkoo hamma tokko hamaa fakkaata.
You need new clothes.	Uffata haaraa si barbaachisa.
What? 	Maal?
I can say that.	Ani akkas jechuu nan danda'a.
But he has it.	Garuu qaba.
It may still be a day.	Ammas guyyaa tokko ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't really know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku ture.
I think it’s the most important.	Inni hunda caalaa barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
But this isn’t so new.	Garuu kun akkas haaraa miti.
She has to go herself.	Ofii ishee deemuu qabdi.
I don’t need a drink.	Dhugaatii na hin barbaachisu.
We need to know who we really are.	Dhuguma eenyu akka taane beekuu qabna.
I didn't understand him enough.	Ani gahaa ta'ee isa hin hubanne.
I couldn't sleep	Hirriba hin dandeenye .
We're really trying to be adults.	Dhuguma nama guddaa ta'uuf yaalaa jirra.
I would love it even more.	Kana caalaa nan jaalladha.
You know they all say that.	Hundi isaanii akkas jedhu beekta.
It looks good to me.	Natti gaarii fakkaata.
There is no such possibility here.	Asitti carraan akkasii hin jiru.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru qofa beekuu barbaade.
But you can't be right.	Garuu sirrii ta'uu hin dandeessu.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Dogoggora hin turre.
I’ve been around a couple of times now.	Amma yeroo lama sadii naannoo isaa jira.
If so, we don’t need to do anything.	Yoo akkas ta’e homaa gochuun nu hin barbaachisu.
Sometimes, it’s not so bad.	Yeroo tokko tokko, akkas hamaa miti.
This is extremely important now.	Kun amma garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
So, .	Kanaaf, .
I don’t mean you, of course.	Ati jechuu koo miti, beekamaadha.
We need to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu qabna.
This is not clear.	Kun ifa miti.
We have no chance in the long run.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti carraa hin qabnu.
We need to do this.	Kana gochuu qabna.
She's right.	Isheen sirrii dha.
It doesn't seem true.	Dhugaa hin fakkaatu.
Just like he was.	Akkuma inni ture.
The same thing happened a couple of days later.	Guyyaa lama lama booda kanuma ta'e.
So far, nothing works.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hojjetu hin jiru.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
He knows a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee beeka.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
But he didn’t do this simple homework.	Garuu hojii manaa salphaa kana hin hojjenne.
I hadn’t thought about it.	Ani itti hin yaadne ture.
It would have been.	Silaa ta'a.
Maybe they were right.	Tarii sirrii turan ta'a.
Now she had a lot of money.	Amma maallaqa guddaa qabdi turte.
I want to know how and why and when.	Akkamitti fi maaliif akka ta'ee fi yoom beekuu barbaada.
I want to know how best to do this.	Akkamitti akka gaariitti kana gochuu danda'u beekuu barbaada.
It may not be the most appropriate name.	Maqaa hunda caalaa sirrii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
You really need one in almost every class.	Kutaa hunda keessatti jechuun ni danda’ama tokko dhuguma si barbaachisa.
He will do the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e ni hojjeta.
It would never happen.	Gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
You can see it in his hands.	Harka isaa keessaa arguu dandeessu.
In this way, the.	Haala kanaan kan.
I couldn’t see anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
Not even with this.	Kana waliin illee miti.
Not right in myself.	Ofii koo keessatti sirrii miti.
He wants to see you.	Inni si arguu barbaada.
Sound, sound, sound.	Sagalee, sagalee, sagalee.
I have no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
That was easy enough.	Sun salphaa gahaa ture.
Picture of the day.	Suuraa guyyaa sanaa.
He didn't speak again.	Ammas hin dubbanne.
Great with great.	Guddaa waliin guddaa.
That's how you know it's the best.	Akkasitti hunda caalaa ta'uu isaa beekta.
Perhaps that is the case.	Tarii akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
That's pretty much it for this week.	Torban kanaaf baay'ee kanuma.
But sometimes someone must.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko namni tokko dirqama.
The past in the present.	Kan darbe yeroo ammaa keessatti.
It just doesn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu qofa.
Sometimes it’s almost like friends.	Yeroo tokko tokko hiriyyoota fakkaata jechuun ni danda’ama.
Certainly not her father.	Abbaa ishee akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He knew his way around.	Karaa isaa naannoo isaa ni beeka ture.
But you can do something about that.	Garuu waa'ee sanaa waan tokko gochuu dandeessa.
But I’m not really interested.	Garuu dhuguma fedhii hin qabu.
Now, she did that.	Amma, akkas goote.
It’s in the house.	Mana keessa jira.
There was plenty there.	Achitti baay'ee ture.
Maybe we would have, once upon a time.	Tarii ni qabna turre, yeroo tokko.
Why do you need to know?	Maaliif beekuu qabda?
It is not in the true language.	Afaan dhugaa keessa hin jiru.
You have to answer me.	Deebii naaf kennuu qabda.
You have a great life with us.	Jireenya guddaa nu waliin qabda.
But they needed more sleep.	Garuu hirriba caalaatti isaan barbaachisa ture.
Again, none of this is new.	Ammas, kun tokkollee haaraa miti.
Not sure if this helps you.	Kun si gargaaruu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I think it was in her house.	Mana ishee keessa ture natti fakkaata.
It's just one thing.	Waan tokko qofa.
I just couldn’t get it.	Ani qofa argachuu hin dandeenye.
It worked for a lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee hojjete.
There was no one else in the waiting room.	Kutaa eegaa keessa namni biraa hin turre.
I looked at them.	Anis isaan ilaale.
One cannot be sure.	Namni mirkanaa'aa ta'uu hin danda'u.
But it’s not a question.	Garuu gaaffii miti.
I think that’s how to tell it.	Akkasitti himuu natti fakkaata.
he wanted to shout.	jedhee iyyuu barbaade.
That would be a great day, that would be a great tomorrow.	Sun guyyaa guddaa ta'a, sun boru guddaa ta'a.
Maybe it's not good.	Tarii gaarii miti.
She is my mother's mother.	Haadha haadha kooti.
But it is a must.	Garuu dirqama.
I knew the truth.	Dhugaa jiru nan beeka ture.
I love new things.	Wantoota haaraa nan jaalladha.
I love that you can do it.	Hojjechuu akka dandeessu nan jaalladha.
No one has ever done this.	Namni kana godhe hin beeku.
I hope he's right.	Sirrii akka ta'e abdiin qaba.
It came right at us.	Sirriitti nu irra dhufe.
We are here now.	Amma as jirra.
You can be one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko taʼuu dandeessa.
It had been clear she was not interested in him.	Isaaf fedhii akka hin qabne ifa ta'ee ture.
You need to do two more things.	Kana caalaa waan lama hojjechuu qabda.
There was no one there.	Namni achi hin turre.
It seems to be in question.	Gaaffii keessa waan jiru fakkaata.
We need to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
We have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabna.
I know he can do it.	Akka danda'u nan beeka.
He doesn’t make mistakes.	Dogoggora hin hojjetu.
But you can do them.	Garuu isaan gochuu dandeessa.
I knew it would be like that.	Akkas akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
That she needs him as much as he needs her.	Isheen hamma inni ishee barbaadu akka isa barbaaddu.
It usually works.	Yeroo baayyee ni hojjeta.
Probably better this way.	Tarii haala kanaan wayya.
We still need your help.	Ammas gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa.
I'm sure it will turn out well.	Akka gaariitti akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha.
But this was completely different.	Garuu kun guutummaatti adda ture.
But he was just a good guy, a really good guy.	Garuu inni gurbaa gaarii qofa ture, gurbaa dhuguma gaarii ture.
We had no idea what to do.	Maal goonu yaada hin qabnu turre.
So we did it.	Kanaaf goone.
They look good.	Isaan gaarii fakkaatu.
But it doesn’t seem to be working.	Garuu waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
He thought she was joking.	Qoosaa jirtu itti fakkaate.
It’s not part of it.	Kutaa isaa miti.
I have this feeling this is not right.	Miira kana qaba kun sirrii miti.
Not like we were in our day.	Akka bara keenya turre miti.
You didn’t know your place.	Bakka kee hin beektu turte.
He didn’t do any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin goone.
I'm in them almost every day.	Guyyaa hunda jechuun ni danda'ama isaan keessa jira.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
Not that it was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture jechuu miti.
They are completely wrong.	Guutummaatti dogoggora qabu.
People like new things.	Namoonni waan haaraa jaallatu.
But it is not	Garuu miti .
He said it wouldn't be me.	Na hin ta'u jedhe.
I know not much.	Baay'ee akka hin taane nan beeka.
It is not like that at all.	Tasumaa akkas miti.
We wanted to do this thing.	Waan kana hojjechuu barbaanne.
I didn’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beeku ture.
No one had a name.	Namni maqaa qabu hin turre.
You never go home.	Ati gonkumaa gara manaatti hin deemtu.
These two men had much in common.	Namoonni lamaan kun waan baayʼee wal fakkaatu qabu turan.
Maybe something happened.	Tarii wanti tokko ta'uu danda'a.
But that’s not entirely the case.	Garuu guutummaatti akkas miti.
He was clear.	Inni ifa ture.
There should be no such thing.	Wanti tokko akkasii jiraachuu hin qabu.
It couldn't be simpler.	Kana caalaa salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
But no one knew what to do.	Garuu namni maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
You were the only person I met after hours.	Nama sa'aatii booda wal arge si qofa ture.
We’re still working on it.	Ammallee irratti hojjechaa jirra.
He lives in my room.	Kutaa koo keessa jiraata.
Obviously not for you.	Siif akka hin taane ifaadha.
But this is not working.	Garuu kun hojjechaa hin jiru.
I mean, I mean.	Jechuun koo.
I am glad I did this.	Kana gochuu kootti gammadeera.
I didn't understand what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle.
Most people want to believe it was.	Namoonni baay'een akkas akka ture amanuu barbaadu.
I'm sure he does.	Akka inni godhu mirkanaa'adha.
It's happening, right now.	Ta'aa jira, yeroo ammaa.
I hope it doesn’t go earlier!	Duraan akka hin deemne abdiin qaba!
Tell him to go.	Akka deemu itti himi.
He asked what else was there.	Kan biraa maaltu jira jedhee gaafate.
He wants to know he'll be fine.	Inni gaarii akka ta'u beekuu barbaada.
There was no time.	Yeroon hin turre ture.
Everything works now.	Hundi amma hojjeta.
No one wants that in their life.	Jireenya isaa keessatti namni akkas barbaadu hin jiru.
So maybe.	Kanaaf tarii.
Everyone seemed to have an opinion.	Namni hundi yaada kennuu waan qabu fakkaata ture.
I just didn’t want to do anything anymore.	Kana booda homaa hojjechuu qofa hin barbaanne.
I wanted to get to know you better.	Caalaatti si beekuu barbaade.
I don't know you.	Ani si hin beeku.
He had a way to go.	Karaa itti deemu qaba ture.
Another three years.	Waggaa sadii kan biraa.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
At some point in her life.	Yeroo tokko tokko jireenya ishee keessatti.
In another lifetime.	Jireenya biraa keessatti.
Things weren’t the same as they used to be.	Wanti akka duraan ture hin turre.
It's not good.	Gaarii miti.
You became home.	Ati mana taate.
I said your name.	Maqaa kee jedheen.
That should help him a bit.	Sun xiqqoo isa gargaaruu qaba.
I didn’t know anyone who really did that anymore.	Nama dhuguma kana booda akkas godhe hin beeku ture.
Something not quite right there.	Waan achitti guutummaatti sirrii hin taane.
Not so good with people.	Nama waliin akkas gaarii miti.
I don’t know if it still exists.	Ammallee jiraachuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
You know exactly why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti beekta.
She hardly knew he had it.	Akka inni qabu baay'ee hin beektu turte.
There's nothing else he can do.	Kan biraa inni gochuu danda'u hin jiru.
But it didn't seem likely.	Garuu waan ta'uu danda'u hin fakkaatu ture.
He didn't seem to know he was supposed to.	Akka ta'uu qabu waan beeku hin fakkaatu ture.
Which no one wants.	Kan namni hin barbaanne.
So it goes away.	Kanaaf ni deema.
I think they are lucky.	Carraa qaban natti fakkaata.
He just didn’t want to.	Inni qofa hin barbaanne.
But there was nothing he could do.	Garuu wanti inni gochuu danda'u hin turre.
Throughout the year.	Waggaa guutuu.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
But it happened.	Garuu ta'e.
It’s there, it’s not going away, it’s there.	Achi jira, hin deemu, achi jira.
He’s obviously not their guy.	Inni gurbaa isaanii akka hin taane ifaadha.
So? 	Kanaaf?
It says a lot about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan baay'ee dubbata.
I like doing that.	Sana gochuun natti tola.
Like we just both knew we had.	Akkuma nuti lamaan keenyayyuu qofa akka qabnu beekne.
I am yours, you are mine.	Ani kan kee, ati kan kooti.
I think even that is wrong.	Sun illee dogoggora natti fakkaata.
This doesn't seem right.	Kun sirrii hin fakkaatu.
Old friends, new, real.	Hiriyyoota durii, haaraa, dhugaa.
You know the problem.	Rakkoo jiru ni beekta.
She’s been working on it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf irratti hojjechaa turte.
Which is not enough right now.	Kan yeroo ammaa gahaa hin taane.
People are like that.	Namoonni akkas.
She did it three times.	Yeroo sadii goote.
I’d rather have something else.	Waan biraa naaf wayya.
I couldn’t see it clearly.	Ani sirriitti arguu hin dandeenye.
It just doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u qofa.
That's what happens.	Kan ta'u kanuma.
It should be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu qaba.
What.	Maal.
They are very, very different.	Isaan baayyee baayyee adda.
He knew his mother well.	Haadha isaa sirriitti beeka ture.
Completely, completely wrong.	Guutummaatti, guutummaatti dogoggora.
He knew everything but nothing.	Waan hundumaa beeku malee homaa hin beeku ture.
I know it sounds a lot like it.	Baay'ee akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
I was myself.	Ani ofii koo ture.
You can definitely do better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
He hadn’t even done that.	Sana illee hin goone ture.
It wasn’t without each other.	Wal malee hin turre.
He knew how one would look.	Tokko akkamitti akka fakkaatu beeka ture.
But, a house.	Garuu, mana tokko.
He knows his ways.	Karaa isaa ni beeka.
That worked great.	Sun baayyee hojjete.
This time it would happen.	Yeroo kana ni ta'a ture.
Check out the many ideas.	Yaada hedduu ilaalaa.
It’s just me this time.	Yeroo kana ana qofa.
This is a really, really good book.	Kun kitaaba dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii dha.
He wouldn’t go home.	Inni gara manaatti hin deemu ture.
I am no different from my work.	Ani hojii koo irraa adda hin jiru.
He was going home.	Gara manaatti deemaa ture.
In this section.	Kutaa kana keessatti.
It works on them.	Isaan irratti hojjeta.
That's it today, not a girl.	Har'a kanuma malee intala miti.
Wait and see.	Eegaa ilaalaa.
I want him to do it.	Akka inni godhu nan barbaada.
I know a lot of people.	Namoota baay'een beeka.
Look up at it.	Ol ilaalaa.
They can be really really good.	Dhuguma dhuguma gaarii ta’uu danda’u.
He took that time.	Yeroo sana fudhate.
So we never.	Kanaaf nuti gonkumaa.
People were worse.	Namoonni kana caalaa hamaa turan.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
I think it's one of them.	Isa tokko natti fakkaata.
It was his chance.	Carraa isaa ture.
You don’t need to do anything more.	Kana caalaa homaa gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
He's going to be like that.	Inni akkas ta'a.
I can do that, no problem.	Ani akkas gochuu nan danda'a, rakkoon hin jiru.
Not sure about that question.	Gaaffii sana irratti mirkanaa'aa miti.
It was a bad idea.	Yaada hamaa ture.
All he has to do is tell the truth.	Wanti inni gochuu qabu dhugaa dubbachuu qofa.
But now you know it’s not that easy.	Amma garuu akkas salphaa akka hin taane beekta.
She made him whole.	Guutuu isa goote.
But that’s okay, you don’t need everyone.	Garuu sun homaa miti, nama hunda si hin barbaachisu.
I love that!.	Sana nan jaalladha!.
No one was out of work.	Namni hojii ala hin turre.
I can tell him why.	Maaliif akka ta'e itti himuu nan danda'a.
And he did it, too.	Inni illee ni godhe.
I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
He said nothing against them.	Isaan irratti homaa hin dubbanne.
That sleep.	Hirriba sana.
But then, that can be a good thing.	Garuu sana booda, sun waan gaarii ta’uu danda’a.
Glad he had a new pair of shoes.	Kophee haaraa qabaachuu isaatti gammade.
I know that exactly.	Sana sirriitti beeka.
You know you shouldn’t be here.	As jiraachuu akka hin qabne beekta.
He knows me too well.	Inni garmalee na beeka.
I think that was a bad time.	Yeroon sun yeroo hamaa ture natti fakkaata.
But mostly me.	Garuu irra caalaa ana.
Then he found what he was looking for.	Sana booda waan barbaadaa ture argate.
But unlikely, now.	Garuu hin fakkaatu, amma.
You’re the only one who can’t.	Kan hin dandeenye si qofa.
It was good enough.	Gaarii gahaa ture.
This should be good.	Kun gaarii ta’uu qaba.
But everyone has it.	Garuu namni hundi qaba.
20 years ago.	Waggaa 20 dura.
Only, I didn’t have enough time.	Qofa, yeroo gahaa hin qabu ture.
Very likely.	Baayyee hin oolu.
There is still a problem.	Ammas rakkoon jira.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I still do it.	Ammallee nan godha.
He didn’t seem all that interested.	Inni hangas fedhii qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
But it didn’t look like her, not exactly.	Garuu ishee hin fakkaatu ture, sirriitti miti.
You still have a chance to live.	Ammas carraa jiraachuu qabda.
We still have no idea what the reason is.	Ammallee sababni isaa maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabnu.
I'm going to be a father, look at me.	Abbaa ta'uuf deema, na ilaalaa.
Not by himself.	Ofii isaatiin miti.
If anything happened, it would happen now.	Osoo wanti ta'e amma ta'a ture.
If he did, you would know.	Osoo akkas godhe silaa beekta.
You can buy them.	Isaan bitachuu dandeessu.
In both of them.	Isaan lamaan keessatti.
But you think.	Garuu jettanii yaaddu.
From to the.	Irraa gara.
I couldn’t leave her.	Ishee dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
This was a huge mistake.	Kun dogoggora guddaa ture.
But they’re not the only ones.	Garuu isaan qofa miti.
You just know what needs to happen.	Waan ta'uu qabu qofa beekta.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
Now your father.	Amma abbaa kee.
I'm enjoying it.	Ani itti gammadeera.
Get back there.	Achitti deebi'i.
I don't know how many, but a couple.	Meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu lama lama.
But he didn’t say any of that.	Garuu waan sana keessaa tokkollee hin dubbanne.
We don’t have that.	Nuti akkas hin qabnu.
You could have just said you knew that.	Silaa akkas jettee beekta jechuu qofa dandeessa turte.
She has a name.	Maqaa qabdi.
It’s on the road.	Karaa irra jira.
Maybe someone knows better.	Tarii namni kana caalaa beeku ta'a.
Time to do the right thing.	Yeroon waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuuf.
She had said.	Jettee turte.
We need to meet.	Wal arguu qabna.
He is there.	Inni achi jira.
I don't want to talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
He realized his mistake too late.	Dogoggora isaa yeroon booda hubate.
It’s not a necessary thing.	Waan barbaachisaa miti.
You can see me now.	Amma na arguu dandeessu.
Mine is just a little bit.	Kan koo xiqqoo qofa.
I want to give it a chance.	Carraa kennuu barbaada.
Not so many.	Akkas baay'ee miti.
Maybe a year.	Tarii waggaa tokko.
I still hadn’t done much work with him.	Ammallee hojii guddaa isa waliin hin hojjenne ture.
He wants to be human.	Nama ta'uu barbaada.
That would be a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ta'a.
But maybe you can help me.	Garuu tarii na gargaaruu dandeessa ta'a.
One was a little girl.	Tokko intala xiqqoo turte.
Being here together again, just the two of us.	Ammas as waliin ta'uu, nu lamaan qofa.
Now it’s my chance.	Amma carraa kooti.
Not very interested.	Baay'ee fedhii hin qabu.
I told him everything I knew.	Waan beeku hunda itti hime.
I wish you didn't have to see me.	Osoo na arguu hin qabdu ta'ee natti tola.
For this day.	Guyyaa kanaaf.
He has a house.	Mana qaba.
I thought he must be there even in this little way.	Karaa xiqqoo kanaan illee achi jiraachuu qaba jedheen yaade.
I don’t know what to do now.	Amma maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I had no idea what it was.	Maal akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It was completely different.	Guutummaatti adda ture.
I knew it then.	Yeroo sanatti nan beeka ture.
This works very well for us in this case.	Kun haala kana keessatti baayyee gaarii nuuf ta'a.
No one asked.	Namni gaafate hin jiru.
This is important to do with my wife.	Kun haadha manaa koo wajjin gochuun barbaachisaa dha.
She should have gone back for him.	Silaa isaaf deebi'uu qabdi turte.
Man had his way.	Namni karaa isaa qaba ture.
I didn’t know that part.	Kutaa sana hin beeku ture.
No one could do it.	Namni tokkollee gochuu hin dandeenye.
I doubt that.	Kana nan shakka.
It was simple, but good.	Salphaa ture, garuu gaarii ture.
We did very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjenne.
But he’s not dangerous.	Garuu inni balaa hin qabu.
I love it, I love it.	Ani jaalladha jaalladha.
But it’s still there.	Garuu ammallee achi jira.
A year has passed.	Waggaa tokko darbe.
You know the place.	Bakka sana ni beekta.
But he had one real chance.	Garuu carraa dhugaa tokko qaba ture.
But you are.	Garuu ati.
But way too long.	Garuu karaa kanaan garmalee dheeraa.
Nobody seems to know much about him.	Waa'ee isaa namni waan baay'ee beeku hin fakkaatu.
Everything is in your hands.	Wanti hundi harka kee keessa jira.
We only have it today.	Har'a qofa qabna.
Same problems.	Rakkoo wal fakkaatu.
Right.	Sirrii.
What is right should be clear.	Wanti sirrii ta'e ifa ta'uu qaba.
Meant.	Jechuu barbaade.
That’s nothing new.	Sun waan haaraa miti.
It was the worst.	Kan hamaa ture.
There is nothing more to it.	Kana caalaa wanti isaa hin jiru.
This was a terrible thing.	Kun waan hamaa ture.
It was extremely important.	Garmalee barbaachisaa ture.
To.	Gara.
Just wait and see.	Eegaa qofa.
I can't get a job.	Hojii argachuu hin danda'u.
I know what she wants.	Waan isheen barbaaddu nan beeka.
In this case it doesn’t.	Haala kana keessatti hin ta’u.
So, it was good.	Kanaaf, gaarii ture.
I have been there several times.	Yeroo hedduu achi tureera.
I love them.	Ani isaan jaalladha.
After that, things are different.	Sana booda wanti jiru adda.
But I don't have it.	Ani garuu hin qabu.
It has a name.	Maqaa qaba.
That’s just the truth.	Sun dhugaa qofa.
It was too big.	Garmalee guddaa ture.
Another problem entirely.	Rakkoo biraa guutummaatti.
He came looking for us.	Nu barbaadaa dhufe.
All good, in my book.	Hundi gaarii, kitaaba koo keessatti.
But not soon enough.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti gahaa miti.
There's not much time.	Yeroon baay'ee hin jiru.
They just didn’t have time for us.	Yeroo nuuf hin qaban turan qofa.
This sounds simple, but it’s not.	Kun salphaa fakkaata, garuu akkas miti.
So tell me this.	Kanaaf kana natti himi.
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
Work is no different from being real, from living our lives.	Hojiin dhugaa ta’uu irraa, jireenya keenya jiraachuu irraa adda miti.
I really think this is it.	Dhuguma kana natti fakkaata.
I didn’t see any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin argine.
He wasn’t there.	Inni achi hin turre.
Again, I enjoyed it very much.	Ammas baayyee itti gammade.
He must know.	Inni beekuu qaba.
I didn't think so.	Ani akkas hin yaadne.
She had no reason to.	Sababni itti gootu hin qabdu turte.
This was a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii ture.
But there was almost none of that.	Garuu sana keessaa tokkollee hin turre jechuun ni danda'ama.
It had to be about now.	Waa'ee ammaa ta'uu qaba ture.
I told your father that.	Abbaa kee kana jedheen ture.
They are everywhere, he said.	Bakka hunda jiru jedhe.
There was no one to help them.	Namni isaan gargaaru hin turre.
With this book.	Kitaaba kanaan.
It can be too much.	Garmalee baay'ee ta'uu danda'a.
I mean, human beings.	Nama jechuu kooti.
He didn't think about it.	Homaa itti hin yaadne.
It looked like it had to be someone else.	Nama biraa ta'uu waan qabu fakkaata ture.
, it’s not me.	, ana miti.
It is always better to tell the truth.	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa dubbachuu wayya.
If it is.	Yoo ta'e.
It just seemed too obvious.	Garmalee ifa ta'e qofa fakkaata ture.
But that wasn’t quite right.	Garuu sun guutummaatti sirrii hin turre.
It’s not a car.	Konkolaataa miti.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
This is no longer such a certainty today.	Kun har’a kana booda waan akkasii mirkanaa’aa miti.
I wanted it so badly.	Ani akka malee barbaade.
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
Mostly they work.	Irra caalaa hojjetu.
We need something new, something new.	Waan haaraa, waan haaraa nu barbaachisa.
Very extremely good, most likely.	Baay'ee garmalee gaarii dha, baay'ee hin oolu.
They were really right on that one.	Dhuguma isa sana irratti sirrii turan.
He said it wouldn't work.	Hin hojjetu jedhe.
But they do very well.	Garuu baayyee gaarii hojjetu.
I know it wasn’t the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii akka hin turre nan beeka.
It's nothing about being human.	Waa'ee nama ta'uu homaa miti.
She wasn’t alone, she said.	Kophaa ishee hin turre jette.
He wants to be in other hands.	Harka biraa keessa jiraachuu barbaada.
Every night is different.	Halkan hundi adda adda.
He found himself alone.	Kophaa isaa of argate.
But they do work.	Garuu ni hojjetu.
She was pretty good though.	Isheen garuu baayyee gaarii turte.
But it will happen.	Garuu ni ta'a.
I doubt many people have.	Namoonni baay'een akka qaban nan shakka.
Maybe, just maybe.	Tarii, tarii qofa.
This thing is no exception.	Wanti kun kanaan ala miti.
We didn’t need that.	Sana nu hin barbaachifne.
It is not a new issue.	Dhimma haaraa miti.
He should never give it away.	Tasumaa kennuu hin qabu.
Really, it shouldn't be.	Dhuguma, ta'uu hin qabu.
He is famous, she said.	Inni beekamaadha jette.
Then he looked at his watch.	Sana booda sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
He has a school and stuff.	Mana barumsaa fi waan akkasii qaba.
I shouldn't have said it.	Silaa jechuu hin qabu ture.
But that may not matter.	Garuu sun dhimma qabaachuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
He had a big question.	Gaaffii guddaa tokko qaba ture.
That was what she needed.	Wanti ishee barbaachisu kanuma ture.
It wasn’t an accident.	Balaa hin turre.
This can’t be the case.	Kun ta’uu hin danda’u.
They were going.	Isaan deemaa turan.
I don't know if he's telling the truth.	Dhugaa dubbachuu isaa hin beeku.
So she's.	Kanaaf isheen.
None of them are inside.	Tokkollee keessaa hin jiru.
You can have a lot of funny moments here.	Yeroo qoosaa hedduu asitti qabaachuu dandeessu.
Just like we do.	Akkuma nuti goonu.
I couldn’t go for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf deemuu hin dandeenye.
That should be easy to do.	Sun gochuun salphaa taʼuu qaba.
We had their shoes.	Kophee isaanii qabna turre.
Obviously, things don’t have to go that way.	Wanti akkasitti deemuu akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
This time the girl.	Yeroo kana intala.
I think it was just me.	Ana qofa ture jedheen yaada.
She isn’t real, she doesn’t exist.	Isheen dhugaa miti, hin jirtu.
It seems different.	Adda fakkaata.
Now he 's	Amma inni .
Presently something would happen.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti tokko ni ta'a ture.
in.	keessa.
This has never been a problem for us.	Kun gonkumaa rakkoo nuuf ta’ee hin beeku.
Let's see why this is.	Mee ilaalaa kana maaliif.
Not entirely sure what to do.	Guutummaatti maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
Exactly my idea of ​​a good time.	Sirriitti yaada koo yeroo gaarii.
I had no idea how to say anything real.	Akkamitti waan dhugaa tokko akkan jedhu yaada hin qabu ture.
You know some of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko tokko ni beekta.
I wondered how that happened.	Akkamitti akkas ta'e jedheen yaade.
I hope it helps you!.	Akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba!.
I needed them.	Isaan na barbaachisa turan.
But they’re not great.	Garuu isaan guddaa miti.
That's all it will be.	Sun qofa ta'a.
But it shouldn't be at my house.	Garuu mana kootti ta'uu hin qabu.
How it works is entirely up to him.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu guutummaatti kan isaa ta'a.
That works sometimes.	Sun yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta.
But it’s the longest part of it.	Garuu kutaa isaa keessaa isa dheeraa dha.
I looked at my father.	Gara abbaa kootti ilaale.
This seemed like the right time.	Yeroon kun yeroo sirrii fakkaata ture.
You have to see it.	Arguu qabda.
But mostly you have to go.	Garuu irra caalaa deemuun dirqama.
I didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
A long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura.
So it goes on.	Kanaaf itti deema.
I just really enjoyed it.	Ani baay'ee itti gammade qofa.
He obviously didn’t understand the question.	Gaaffii sana akka hin hubanne ifaadha.
He saw her do it.	Akka isheen gootu arge.
Try it and see.	Yaalaa ilaalaa.
He was in school.	Mana barumsaa keessa ture.
Tell them why.	Maaliif akka ta'e itti himi.
The one that does well.	Kan gaarii hojjetu.
There was a lot of work.	Hojiin baay'ee ture.
I have only one hope.	Abdii tokko qofa qaba.
So wait for it.	Kanaaf eegaa.
There was no reason.	Sababni hin turre.
I don't think it will happen today.	Har'a waan ta'u natti hin fakkaatu.
Three days later.	Guyyaa sadii booda.
So he was with us, waiting for you.	Kanaaf inni si eegaa, nu bira ture.
There wasn't much he could do from here.	As irraa wanti inni gochuu danda'u baay'een hin turre.
So, that’s how.	Kanaaf, akkas.
She’s just not interested right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana fedhii hin qabdu qofa.
She was alone in the room.	Kutaa keessa kophaa ishee turte.
He realized what he had done.	Waan hojjete hubate.
That’s really nice.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola.
He needs a job.	Hojii barbaada.
No one wants this.	Kana namni barbaadu hin jiru.
We shouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabnu ture.
I knew he would.	Akka godhu nan beeka ture.
One of two things is going to happen now.	Waan lama keessaa tokko amma ta'uuf jira.
I liked a bit more of what was there.	Waan achi jiru caalaa xiqqoo nan jaalladha ture.
I didn't understand.	Anis hin hubanne.
Nothing works here.	Asitti wanti hojjetu hin jiru.
You have to ask.	Gaafachuu qabda.
I hope that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
Look at us.	Nu ilaalaa.
That person was me.	Namni sun ana ture.
He hadn't told anyone how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e nama tokkollee hin dubbanne ture.
He needs a guy’s name.	Maqaa gurbaa isa barbaachisa.
Someone is still looking for her.	Ammallee namni tokko ishee barbaadaa jira.
It seemed pretty obvious to me.	Baay'ee ifa natti fakkaate.
They’re really not the same thing.	Dhuguma isaan waan tokko miti.
He wouldn’t have done anything like that.	Silaa waan akkasii hin hojjetu ture.
But they are trying to do it.	Garuu gochuuf yaalaa jiru.
But this is only right.	Garuu kun sirrii qofa.
It’s just necessary.	Barbaachisaa qofa.
That’s what he started.	Kanuma jalqabe.
It is not right to do so.	Akkas gochuun sirrii miti.
I know you were trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa akka turte nan beeka.
I have been on this problem for a long time.	Rakkoo kana irratti yeroo dheeraaf ture.
He didn't know the answer.	Deebii isaa hin beekne.
I wanted no part of them.	Kutaa isaanii tokkollee hin barbaanne.
Very few people know the truth about it.	Namoonni dhugaa waa'ee isaa beeku baay'ee muraasa.
I can't play with anyone else.	Kan biraa waliin taphachuu hin danda'u.
There were just too many people.	Namoonni baay'ee qofa turan.
I have serious problems with this guy.	Gurbaa kana waliin rakkoo hamaa qaba.
It's not about this.	Waa'ee kanaa miti.
Like everyone else.	Akkuma nama hundumaa.
They hadn’t done that yet.	Hanga ammaatti akkas hin goone turan.
What they have in place in a lot of situations here.	Waan isaan bakka qaban haala baay'ee keessatti asitti.
But very good.	Garuu baayyee gaarii.
So, we were on it.	Kanaaf, irra turre.
We were in a road.	Karaa tokko keessa turre.
We were good.	Gaarii turre.
It can never happen.	Yoomiyyuu ta'uu hin danda'u.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
No one could say.	Namni jechuu hin dandeenye.
She was watching them, of course.	Isheen isaan ilaalaa akka turte beekamaadha.
He said it didn't work.	Hin hojjenne jedhe.
I think this is the most important thing.	Kun waan hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta’e natti fakkaata.
Not everyone is the same.	Namni hundi tokko miti.
I think I love you.	Si jaalladha jedheen yaada.
But he couldn’t do it in time.	Garuu yeroo isaa keessatti hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
You have to do the work.	Hojii hojjechuu qabda.
That morning.	Ganama sana.
Better to have them.	Isaan qabaachuu wayya.
Now I have one.	Amma tokko qaba.
Again, it's a mistake!	Ammas dogoggora!
It seemed.	Fakkaate.
You need it.	Si barbaachisa.
This one was different.	Inni kun adda ture.
They were not his friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota isaa hin turre.
I really enjoyed it there.	Dhuguma achitti gammadeera.
I would never do this today, of course.	Har'a kana gonkumaa hin godhu ture, beekamaadha.
I don’t think one is easier than the other.	Tokko kan biraa caalaa salphaa natti hin fakkaatu.
That can't be right.	Sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
How much is this?	Kun meeqa?
I wasn’t home enough with the kids.	Ijoollee waliin mana gahaa hin turre.
Nothing else will happen.	Wanti biraa hin ta'u.
But that was clearly not the case.	Garuu akkas akka hin turre ifaadha.
Not very important though.	Baay'ee barbaachisaa miti garuu.
It was that time of year.	Yeroon sun yeroo waggaa sana ture.
We are clearer than that.	Nuti kana caalaa ifaadha.
We’re going to do something good.	Waan gaarii hojjechuuf jirra.
In this case, however, this is not the case.	Haala kana keessatti garuu akkas miti.
He.	Isa.
We have a life, a full life.	Jireenya qabna, jireenya guutuu qabna.
This, however, is different.	Kun garuu adda.
She is our mother.	Isheen haadha keenya.
But it was only three days ago.	Garuu guyyaa sadii dura qofa ture.
That won't be necessary, really.	Sun barbaachisaa hin ta'u, dhuguma.
Luckily for him.	Carraa isaaf.
It is not our opinion.	Yaada keenya miti.
I mean the good one.	Isa gaarii jechuu kooti.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Homaa, homaa, homaa miti.
I never know about them.	Waa'ee isaanii gonkumaa hin beeku.
But otherwise, it was just the two of them.	Garuu yoo kana hin taane, isaan lamaan qofa turan.
Does this seem right?	Kun sirrii fakkaataa?
I don't have to do this.	Ani kana gochuu hin qabu.
He did nothing but what he wanted.	Waan barbaade malee homaa hin goone.
You could say they were.	Isaan turan jechuu dandeessa.
I can't help you.	Si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I, of course not.	Ani, akka hin taane beekamaadha.
So, .	Kanaaf, .
But he wasn’t here the whole time.	Garuu yeroo sana guutuu as hin turre.
But I couldn't.	Ani garuu hin dandeenye.
We can’t live together.	Waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenyu.
Doing something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu.
It didn’t exist before that.	Sana dura hin turre.
Still a voice, still a familiar voice.	Ammas sagalee, ammas sagalee inni beeku.
Not together, of course.	Waliin miti, beekamaadha.
So you have no answer.	Kanaaf deebii hin qabdu.
In your questions.	Gaaffii keessan keessatti.
That was something else he hadn't thought about.	Sun waan biraa inni itti hin yaadne ture.
It’s not just that.	Akkas qofa miti.
But if only it were that simple.	Garuu osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
I definitely don't want to be that guy.	Ani gurbaa sana ta'uu akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
This seems like a good opportunity.	Kun carraa gaarii fakkaata.
Good luck!.	Carraa gaarii!.
It's just a joke	Qoosaa qofa .
It wasn’t in his place.	Bakka isaa hin turre.
But no one tried to do it.	Garuu namni hojjechuuf yaale hin jiru.
That’s pretty obvious.	Sun baay’ee ifaadha.
Like his own father.	Akkuma abbaa ofii.
I am working from home.	Ani manaa hojjechaa jira.
I don’t want any trouble.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin barbaadu.
They thought it was the worst.	Isaan waan isa hamaa itti fakkaate.
It still works.	Ammas ni hojjeta.
He said he needed it several times.	Yeroo hedduu akka isa barbaachisu dubbateera.
I shouldn’t have said anything.	Silaa homaa dubbachuu hin qabu ture.
It was exactly what he thought.	Sirriitti waan inni yaade ture.
I never understood it.	Ani gonkumaa hin hubanne.
I wasn't really sure until now.	Hanga ammaatti dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I have my way.	Karaa koo qaba.
Just like she was.	Akkuma isheen turte.
I love her more than life.	Jireenya caalaa ishee jaalladha.
I love that it just needs work.	Hojii qofa akka barbaadu nan jaalladha.
It doesn’t have anything at all.	Tasumaa homaa hin qabu.
I love it so much.	Baay'een jaalladha.
All of them in the same room.	Hundi isaanii kan kutaa tokko keessa jiru.
You may not need any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee si hin barbaachisu taʼa.
Whatever happens, it happens.	Waan ta'u, ni ta'a.
This didn’t happen.	Kun hin taane.
Everything he’s done for me my whole life .	Waan inni jireenya koo guutuu naaf godhe hunda .
I know it can't be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka.
It wasn’t a matter of knowing.	Dhimma beekuu hin turre.
That's nothing.	Sun homaa miti.
It went a lot.	Baay'ee deeme.
I will never know.	Yoomiyyuu hin beeku.
Maybe her whole week.	Tarii torban ishee guutuu ta'a.
It might be a little long, but that's okay.	Xiqqoo dheeraa ta'uu danda'a, garuu sun homaa hin qabu.
But he doesn't know anyone.	Garuu nama inni beeku hin jiru.
This is me.	Kun ana.
I'm sure it wasn't like that.	Akkas akka hin turre mirkanaa'adha.
We should be really good at doing this.	Kana gochuudhaan dhuguma gaarii ta’uu qabna.
Everything you need is there.	Wanti si barbaachisu hundi achi jira.
Everything about you.	Waa'ee kee waan hundumaa.
He had many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qaba ture.
It took me a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa natti fudhate.
I was good to you.	Ani siif gaarii ture.
Better to do without it.	Isa malee hojjechuu wayya.
It was a very good day.	Guyyaa baayyee gaarii ture.
Sorry about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dhiifama.
Some may say that he is unemployed.	Tarii namoonni tokko tokko hojii malee jira jedhu taʼa.
Very, very much.	Baayyee baayyee.
Look for it.	Barbaadaa.
In the long run.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti.
This is what they do.	Kana isaan godhu.
It was entirely possible.	Guutummaatti ni danda’ama ture.
He just loved to play.	Inni taphachuu qofa jaallata ture.
There's not much going on.	Waan baay'ee deemaa jiru hin jiru.
I don’t do it.	Hin godhu.
I know exactly where you’re going.	Bakka deemtu sirriitti beeka.
With the children.	Ijoollee waliin.
There is no house.	Mana hin jiru.
He works for me.	Inni naaf hojjeta.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
She has a daughter.	Intala tokko qabdi.
What you need to know.	Waan beekuu qabdu.
Please wait here.	Mee as eegaa.
In my hands.	Harka koo keessa.
I never understood that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas naaf hin galle.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
But that’s my feeling.	Garuu miira koo kanuma.
He was holding me.	Inni na qaba ture.
But I don't do it.	Ani garuu hin godhu.
I don’t say it.	Hin jedhu.
I really don’t know what to expect.	Dhuguma maal akka eegaa jiru hin beeku.
We never wanted to do that.	Nuti gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin barbaanne.
This is not going to happen.	Kun ta'uuf hin deemu.
Something inside me.	Waan keessa koo keessa jiru.
Why don't you do that again?.	Ammas maaliif akkas hin gootu?.
Today, however, it is not easy.	Har'a garuu salphaa miti.
This worked great for me.	Kun waan guddaa naaf hojjete.
I think it was like that.	Akkas ture natti fakkaata.
I've seen this a lot.	Kana baay'een arge.
He is very nice, really nice.	Inni baayyee namatti tola, dhuguma namatti tola.
A lot of people have kids.	Namoonni baay'een ijoollee qabu.
I can't believe no one helps.	Namni tokkollee hin gargaaru jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
That would be bad.	Sun hamaa ta'a.
This is my father.	Kun abbaa kooti.
They want her.	Ishee barbaadu.
Tell him about it.	Itti himi.
But you know them.	Ati garuu isaan beeku.
You know why you are like that.	Maaliif akkas akka taate beekta.
He was just a problem.	Inni rakkoo qofa ture.
This will always be you.	Kun yeroo hundumaa si ta'a.
I didn't want to.	Ani hin barbaanne.
Always, there waiting.	Yeroo hundumaa, achitti eegaa ture.
But it is a must.	Garuu dirqama.
I didn't want to go back just yet.	Ammas qofa duubatti deebi'uu hin barbaanne.
Answers she was looking for.	Deebii isheen barbaadaa turte.
I don't understand anymore.	Kana booda naaf hin galle.
I could have been a teacher.	Barsiisaa ta'uu nan danda'a ture.
We became three of them.	Isaan keessaa sadii taane.
Even this was never certain.	Kun illee gonkumaa mirkanaa’aa hin turre.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
How was he supposed to know?	Akkamitti beekuu qaba ture?
This is not easy at all.	Kun tasumaa salphaa miti.
He should have just said that.	Silaa akkas jechuu qofa qaba ture.
Both of you.	Lamaan keessan.
He was here for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf as ture.
He wants to scream in me.	Na keessaa iyyuu barbaada.
This wasn’t doing any good.	Kun waan gaarii tokkollee hojjechaa hin turre.
One should know.	Namni beekuu qaba.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
To do too much.	Garmalee hojjechuuf.
He is very good at that.	Sana irratti baayyee gaarii dha.
I want to help them.	Isaan gargaaruu barbaada.
None of that is a problem.	Sana keessaa tokkollee rakkoo hin qabu.
They were still there.	Ammas achi turan.
This was the case.	Kun ture.
They were pretty big.	Isaan baayyee guddaa turan.
That shouldn't be an issue.	Sun dhimma ta'uu hin qabu.
Now he had to stay on the car.	Amma konkolaataa irra turuu qaba ture.
I don’t want one for him.	Tokko isaaf hin barbaadu.
I can't live any longer.	Kana caalaa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
It wasn’t bad this time.	Yeroo kana hamaa hin turre.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
You need it a lot.	Baay'ee si barbaachisa.
There is nothing like that.	Homaa akkasii hin jiru.
Maybe not for long.	Tarii yeroo dheeraaf ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Many of us like it that way.	Baay'een keenya akkasitti nutti tola.
But more is at stake.	Garuu kana caalaa balaa irra jira.
You probably didn't.	Ati tarii hin goone ta'a.
So far, however, this has never happened.	Hanga ammaatti garuu kun ta'ee hin beeku.
We have a lot of kids like her here.	Asitti ijoollee akka ishee baay'ee qabna.
This is just wrong.	Kun dogoggora qofa.
It happened on my watch.	Sa'aatii koo irratti ta'e.
She wasn't sure what she was going to do.	Maal gochuuf akka deemtu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Of course this is how it can happen.	Kun akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u beekamaadha.
We have a job.	Hojii qabna.
No one can live in this area.	Namni naannoo kana keessa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
It seems clear to us that there is.	Akka jiru ifa nutti fakkaata.
Now you have a problem!	Amma rakkoo qabda!
He had an idea.	Yaada qaba ture.
I don't know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf deemu hin beeku.
I’m not saying any of that is wrong.	Sana keessaa tokkollee dogoggora qaba jechuu koo miti.
I was there, you know.	Ani achi ture beekta.
Of course, that never happens.	Sun gonkumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
We have everything in there.	Waan hundumaa achi keessa qabna.
No one does it.	Namni godhu hin jiru.
This is already happening.	Kun duruu ta'aa jira.
It wasn't even that funny.	Akkas illee qoosaa hin turre.
This, it seems, was an important moment.	Kun, yeroo barbaachisaa ture fakkaata.
But not in this case.	Haala kana keessatti garuu miti.
One is never enough.	Tokko gonkumaa gahaa miti.
I don’t want to do these things.	Wantoota kana gochuu hin barbaadu.
I wasn’t going to make the same mistake.	Dogoggora wal fakkaatu hojjechuuf hin turre.
It’s really good stuff, really, really good.	Dhuguma waan gaarii dha, dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii dha.
He was tall.	Inni dheeraa ture.
At that point, he wondered.	Yeroo sanatti jedhee of gaafate.
You have to be good at it.	Itti ga'umsa qabaachuu qabda.
He still wants it.	Ammallee barbaada.
No one had a name.	Namni maqaa hin qabu ture.
It’s important.	Barbaachisaa dha.
But still, they’re there.	Garuu ammas, isaan achi jiru.
Things like that.	Wantoota akkasii.
In this case, everyone got what they wanted.	Haala kana keessatti namni hundi waan barbaade argate.
To exclude them.	Isaan ala gochuuf.
That's what he said.	Kana jedhe.
He wants him.	Isa barbaada.
I knew she was right.	Sirrii akka taate nan beeka ture.
We hope it helps.	Akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
That would be a pretty big deal.	Sun waan baayyee guddaa ta'a.
You’ve been here before, haven’t you?	Ati kanaan dura as turte mitii?
You and your children.	Ati fi ijoollee kee.
I’ve known him for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa beeka.
I just don't understand how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e qofa naaf hin galle.
But he was still there.	Garuu ammas achi ture.
But it is not complete.	Garuu guutuu miti.
He didn't speak.	Hin dubbanne.
So he told them about it.	Kanaaf isaan irratti hime.
I didn’t see anyone around.	Nama naannoo sana jiru hin argine.
Except no one knew when that would happen.	Sun yoom akka ta'u namni beeku hin turre malee.
I think it's right.	Sirrii natti fakkaata.
I’ve been so indulgent for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf akkasitti ofitti gammadeera.
He falls in love with her quickly.	Dafee ishee jaallata.
They were my friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota koo turan.
Good luck for sure on that one.	Carraa gaarii mirkanaa'aa isa sana irratti.
Look at what is going on.	Waan deemaa jiru ilaalaa.
He is no longer there.	Kana booda hin jiru.
He couldn’t give her what she asked for.	Waan gaafate kennuu hin dandeenye.
Again, they were obviously right.	Ammas sirrii akka turan ifaadha.
Maybe you did.	Tarii ati goote ta'a.
He had them both.	Isaan lamaan qaba ture.
This was true.	Kun dhugaa ture.
But wait.	Garuu eegaa.
It wasn’t long then.	Yeroo sanatti yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
Still, not much more than a few good outfits.	Ammas ta’ee, uffata gaarii muraasa malee waan baay’ee miti.
I can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin danda'u.
It wasn't much of anything.	Waan baay'ee hin turre.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu waan barbaade hin fakkaatu ture.
Everyone can see that.	Sana namni hundi arguu danda'a.
This had none of it.	Kun tokkollee hin qabu ture.
He went with his mother.	Haadha isaa waliin deeme.
They were things he didn't know, things about himself.	Waan inni hin beekne, waa'ee ofii isaa waan beeku turan.
That wasn’t so good.	Sun hangas gaarii hin turre.
But he is in a bad situation.	Garuu haala hamaa keessa jira.
I know you are looking for her.	Ishee barbaadaa akka jirtu nan beeka.
There were not many people today.	Har'a namoonni baay'een hin turre.
It’s my job.	Hojii kooti.
I want to say something.	Waan tokko jechuu barbaada.
Maybe it's nothing.	Tarii homaa ta'uu danda'a.
But this was not a promise.	Garuu kun kan waadaa hin turre.
It looks like this.	Kana fakkaata.
. . . .	.
Only now things will be different.	Amma qofa wanti adda ta'a.
The sound above everything else.	Sagalee waan biraa hunda irra jiru.
But this will never happen.	Garuu kun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
I'm going to go to him.	Gara isaa nan deema.
He didn't say where it would be.	Eessa akka ta'u hin dubbanne.
I look more like my father than my mother.	Haadha koo caalaa abbaa koo nan fakkaata.
He needs a job.	Hojii barbaada.
That will work.	Sun ni hojjeta.
You probably know that.	Kana beekuu kee hin oolu.
It's probably bad.	Hamaa ta'uu hin oolu.
They know all about that.	Waa'ee sanaa hunda ni beeku.
In this he was no different.	Kana keessatti inni adda hin turre.
It won't happen now.	Amma hin ta'u.
He likes to be in his room.	Kutaa isaa keessa jiraachuu ni jaallata.
She needs to know.	Isheen beekuu qabdi.
They’re trying, but it’s not working.	Yaalaa jiru, garuu hin hojjetu.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'e, wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deeme.
But to him, this was nothing.	Isaaf garuu kun homaa hin turre.
You will love this episode.	Kutaa kana ni jaallattu.
He knew exactly how to do that.	Sana akkamitti akka godhu sirriitti beeka ture.
There is nothing she can do.	Wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
It could be one of your children.	Ijoollee keessan keessaa tokko taʼuu dandaʼa.
They just have each other.	Wal qofa qabu.
That was easy to find.	Sun argachuu salphaa ture.
I don't want to do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin barbaadu.
We worked together.	Waliin hojjenne.
But he is right.	Garuu inni sirrii dha.
Then he climbed into his car.	Sana booda konkolaataa isaa keessa ol ba'e.
They hadn't talked about it.	Waa'ee kanaa hin dubbanne turan.
It will happen today.	Har'a ni ta'a.
She shouldn’t have said anything.	Silaa homaa dubbachuu hin qabdu turte.
I did, but not exactly.	Anis nan godhe, garuu sirriitti miti.
Most people are just curious.	Namoonni baay'een fedhii qofa qabu.
I wondered what the problem was.	Rakkoon jiru maali jedheen yaade.
There is nothing you can do now.	Amma wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I had no idea what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu yaada hin qabu ture.
Look for us there.	Achitti nu barbaadaa.
He knows you’re not what he wants.	Ati waan inni barbaadu akka hin taane beeka.
Let's see what happened.	Mee ilaalaa waan ta'e.
I still didn't understand who it was.	Ammas eenyu akka ta'e hin hubanne.
Someone should have told you before me.	Silaa na dura namni tokko sitti himuu qaba ture.
He tells a joke.	Qoosaa dubbata.
But it wasn't the worst that could happen.	Garuu waan hamaa ta'uu danda'u hin turre.
But he thought they would belong to him.	Garuu kan isaa ta'u jedhee yaade.
He didn’t want to come here.	Inni as dhufuu hin barbaanne.
I saw what happened.	Waan ta'e arge.
On the hands.	Harka irratti.
He has a lot of money	Maallaqa hedduu qaba
Maybe he loves you a lot.	Tarii baay'ee si jaallata ta'a.
No one will ever know this.	Namni kana yoomiyyuu hin beeku.
He’s right, of course.	Inni sirrii dha, beekamaadha.
But not this guy.	Garuu gurbaa kana miti.
He was now a man of the house.	Inni amma nama manaa ture.
That’s who you are.	Eenyu akka taate kanuma.
He could still do it.	Ammas ni dandaʼa ture.
But many need so much more.	Baay'een garuu kana caalaa waan baay'ee isaan barbaachisa.
I want to go.	Ani deemuu barbaada.
Went up in the afternoon.	Waaree booda ol ba'e.
He may have had a very good reason.	Sababa baayʼee gaarii qaba ture taʼa.
I was trying to.	Ani yaalaa ture.
She didn’t know me.	Isheen na hin beekne.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
But, it still wouldn’t work.	Garuu, ammallee hin hojjetu ture.
I love it so much.	Ani baay'een jaalladha.
It can have many names.	Maqaa hedduu qabaachuu danda'a.
What did you say?	Maal jette?
It has a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee qaba.
He has a chance, though.	Carraa qaba garuu.
I like to walk a lot.	Baayyee deemuun natti tola.
Help! 	Gargaaruu!
help! 	gargaaruu!
Good idea, maybe.	Yaada gaarii, tarii.
I can't eat properly.	Nyaata sirriitti nyaachuu hin danda'u.
It couldn't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
That you are a man	Akka ati nama .
She really needs to surrender all that.	Dhuguma sana hunda harka kennuu qabdi.
With this one, however, he was different.	Isa kanaan garuu adda ture.
No one was interested.	Namni fedhii qabu hin turre.
Your time and mine may still be long.	Yeroon kee fi kan koo ammallee dheeraa ta'uu danda'a.
I am going to help her.	Ani ishee gargaaruuf deema.
He was always good with kids.	Yeroo hundumaa ijoollee wajjin gaarii ture.
It’s not that easy .	Akkas salphaa miti .
I can make this work for you.	Kana akka siif hojjetu gochuu nan danda'a.
He hadn’t thought of that.	Inni akkas hin yaadne ture.
But how? 	Garuu akkamitti?
Until then, there is nothing you can do.	Hanga sanatti wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I know he's right.	Sirrii akka ta'e nan beeka.
Now it's right.	Amma sirrii.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Dogoggora hin turre.
I thought we agreed on this issue.	Dhimma kana irratti walii galle natti fakkaate.
He wanted to belong.	Kan isaa ta'uu barbaade.
But it wouldn't be so easy.	Garuu akkas salphaa hin ta'u ture.
He tried but didn’t know how to help us.	Yaale garuu akkamitti akka nu gargaaru hin beekne.
Please not him, please not him.	Maaloo isa miti maaloo isa hin taane.
And yet, no one wanted to know.	Ammas ta'ee, namni beekuu barbaade hin jiru.
They shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qaban.
When did this happen?	Kun yoom ta'e?
Man enjoyed it.	Namni itti gammade.
You can do this in two ways.	Kana karaa lamaan gochuu dandeessa.
He is waiting for you.	Inni si eegaa jira.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
But that is still not the case with us.	Ammas garuu akkas miti kan keenya.
They didn’t want me.	Isaan na hin barbaanne.
It was the only opportunity we had.	Carraa nuti qabnu qofa ture.
Long before you.	Yeroo dheeraa dura si dura.
This was a great time.	Yeroon kun yeroo guddaa ture.
Then he started.	Sana booda jalqabe.
I don't want anything	Ani homaa hin barbaadu .
We don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu.
You are more human than you know.	Ati kan beektu caalaa nama dha.
Clearly, this was not the case.	Akkas akka hin turre ifaadha.
I should have told my kids.	Silaa ijoollee kootti himuu qaba ture.
None of them are new.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee haaraa miti.
Then it happened again.	Sana booda ammas ta'e.
But maybe it could happen.	Garuu tarii ta'uu danda'a.
He was certainly there.	Inni achi akka ture beekamaadha.
Not really sure anyone else can.	Dhuguma namni biraa akka danda'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
I won't tell you.	Sitti hin himu.
They loved not having to work.	Hojii hojjechuu dhiisuu isaanii ni jaallatu turan.
I knew what that meant.	Kana jechuun maal akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
I think so.	Akkas jedheen yaada.
I really think this is the only way.	Dhuguma karaa kana qofa natti fakkaata.
That would have been plenty at the time.	Yeroo sanatti sun baay'ee ta'a ture.
There wasn't much else.	Wanti biraa baay'ee hin turre.
I know it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka.
It is extremely important right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
I don't know how this happened.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
That's already happening.	Sun duruu ta'aa jira.
We didn’t talk.	Nuti hin dubbanne.
It was now morning.	Amma ganama ture.
It’s not just me.	Ana qofa miti.
They want the money.	Maallaqa sana barbaadu.
I told him he didn’t have to do anything.	Homaa gochuun akka hin qabne itti hime.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
Lots of pictures.	Suuraa baay'ee.
When we need it.	Yeroo nu barbaachisu.
Like in two days.	Akkuma guyyaa lama keessatti.
I didn’t know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku ture.
A terrible mistake.	Dogoggora hamaa.
But you have it.	Garuu qabda.
You may be able to help us with this task.	Hojii kana irratti nu gargaaruu dandeessu ta'a.
I have a little problem.	Rakkoo xiqqoo qabaachuu koo.
I was not one of these people.	Ani namoota kana keessaa tokko hin turre.
But, you had to be doing really well.	Garuu, dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jiraachuu qabda turte.
We don’t need any more.	Kana caalaa nu hin barbaachisu.
There's more to it than just emotions.	Miira qofa osoo hin taane waan baay'ee of keessaa qaba.
It certainly wasn’t entirely true.	Guutummaatti dhugaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
It really doesn’t matter though.	Dhuguma garuu dhimma hin qabu.
In the present tense.	Yeroo ammaa keessatti.
They don't have a clock.	Isaan kun sa'aatii hin qaban.
She didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akka gootu hin beektu turte.
Neither of us can go home now.	Lamaan keenyayyuu amma gara manaatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
Why did this happen? 	Maaliif akkas ta'e?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Going back and not seeing him.	Duubatti deebi'uu fi isa arguu dhiisuu.
But this is not the only answer.	Garuu deebii kana qofa miti.
I have no idea what the problem here is.	Rakkoon asitti jiru maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
It doesn’t even mean it’s not right.	Sirrii miti jechuu illee miti.
I can't live without it.	Isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
There was no other problem.	Rakkoon biraa hin turre.
So he has to give his full opinion.	Kanaaf yaada isaa guutuu kennuu qaba.
But that dog.	Garuu saree sana.
This is going to work.	Kun hojjechuuf deema.
This may be less frequent than one would like.	Kun namni tokko barbaadu caalaa yeroo muraasaaf ta’uu danda’a.
Didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beekne.
That's the one there.	Kan achi jiru sana.
There was no one else.	Namni biraa hin turre.
She was truly a lively and very special person.	Dhuguma nama jireenya qabduu fi baayyee adda taate turte.
It’s just me here.	Asitti ana qofa.
I don’t want to comment on anything else.	Waan biraa yaada kennuu hin barbaadu.
She had none of it.	Isheen tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
Not that it matters now.	Amma dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
He did well for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf waan gaarii hojjete.
Except sometimes they have time.	Yeroo tokko tokko yeroo qabu malee.
But I wasn't so sure.	Garuu hangas mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But it is in a good place.	Garuu bakka gaarii irra jira.
He looked more like his father.	Caalaatti abbaa isaa fakkaata ture.
Maybe you are that person who can help them.	Tarii ati nama isaan gargaaruu dandeessu sana ta'uu dandeessa.
He knew where to look.	Bakka itti barbaadu beeka ture.
It's just a possibility.	Waan ta'uu danda'u qofa.
You will know when you do this.	Yeroo kana gootu ni beekta.
It was going to happen.	Ta'uuf ture.
Sometimes a little, other times completely.	Yeroo tokko tokko xiqqoo, yeroo biraa guutummaatti.
He’s known me all my life.	Jireenya koo guutuu na beeka.
Someone was waiting for her.	Namni tokko ishee eegaa ture.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
I mean, we are.	Jirra jechuu kooti.
I know one thing.	Waan tokko beeka.
You are here with us.	Nu waliin as jirtu.
I'm not so good at that.	Ani akkas sana irratti ga'umsa hin qabu.
It’s a mistake.	Dogoggora dha.
Tell me something else.	Waan biraa natti himi.
Yet the problem still exists.	Ammas rakkoon jiru ammallee jira.
And she did it again.	Ammas akkas goote.
Yours must be the problem.	Kan keessan rakkoo ta'uu qaba.
It would have looked like this.	Silaa akkas fakkaata ture.
On the promise in them.	Waadaa isaan keessa jiru irratti.
I think that was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture jedheen yaada.
It had happened.	Ta'ee ture.
That worked well, but it was a lot of work.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjete, garuu hojii guddaa ture.
I don’t say it.	Hin jedhu.
They were great.	Isaan guddaa turan.
So it doesn't help much.	Kanaaf baayyee hin gargaaru.
There was always something.	Yeroo hundumaa wanti tokko ture.
Obviously, it was a mistake.	Dogoggora akka taʼe beekamaadha.
In her case, it didn’t seem that way.	Dhimma ishee irratti garuu akkas hin fakkaatu ture.
There is something you need to know.	Waan beekuu qabdu tokko jira.
I thought it was something like that.	Waan akkasii natti fakkaate.
Some good stuff.	Wantoota gaarii tokko tokko.
They have a loud voice.	Sagalee guddaa qabu.
Obviously, something was wrong.	Wanti tokko dogoggora akka ture ifaadha.
Not in my case though.	Dhimma koo irratti garuu miti.
No one really knows what to do.	Dhuguma namni maal akka godhu beeku hin jiru.
She really had to go.	Dhuguma deemuun ishee irra ture.
I would have done it.	Silaa nan godha ture.
You can’t have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
Nothing like that happened.	Wanti akkasii hin taane.
It wasn’t great.	Guddaa hin turre.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kana miti.
He did so without much hope.	Abdii guddaa tokko malee akkas godhe.
There was no other opportunity.	Carraan biraa hin turre.
They are looking for opportunities.	Carraa barbaadaa jiru.
He’s often alone.	Yeroo baay’ee kophaa isaa ta’a.
So we can’t say it’s okay.	Kanaaf homaa miti jechuu hin dandeenyu.
I think it’s a great thing.	Waan guddaa natti fakkaata.
Clearly, this is not the problem.	Rakkoon kun akka hin taane ifaadha.
Which was the case.	Kan ture.
But you should have seen me.	Silaa garuu na arguu qabda turte.
I love that car.	Konkolaataa sana nan jaalladha.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
Which is where you are.	Kan bakka jirtu.
But it is very important.	Garuu baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
Didn't see much of anything.	Waan baay'ee hin argine.
He’s there, pictures and all.	Inni achi jira, suuraa fi hunda.
I knew something wasn’t right.	Waan tokko sirrii akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
This was true.	Kun dhugaa ture.
Where were you? 	Eessa turte?
It was in his mouth.	Afaan isaa keessa ture.
Maybe not so good.	Tarii akkas gaarii miti.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
This is not all.	Kun hunda miti.
It was for his day.	Guyyaa isaaf ture.
He's outside.	Isa ala.
She was your mother.	Haadha kee turte.
I think he’s one of the good guys.	Namoota gaarii keessaa tokko natti fakkaata.
It had to be tonight.	Halkan kana ta'uu qaba ture.
I knew her.	Ani ishee beeka ture.
I won't do it now.	Amma hin godhu.
I could have gone to him.	Silaa gara isaa deemuu danda'a ture.
It's going to be great.	Guddaa ta'uuf deema.
But, again, probably not.	Garuu, ammas, tarii hin ta'u.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
It wasn’t really home.	Dhuguma mana hin turre.
If not, who knows.	Yoo hin taane eenyutu beeka.
But it’s not the same.	Garuu wal hin fakkaatu.
I will never forgive you.	Yoomiyyuu dhiifama siif hin godhu.
It wasn’t a bad thing.	Waan hamaa hin turre.
That’s her job.	Hojiin ishee kanuma.
But he hadn't told anyone why.	Garuu maaliif akka ta'e namatti hin himne ture.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas ta’ee hin turre.
So we needed everybody.	Kanaaf nama hunda nu barbaachisa ture.
We just didn’t want any of ours.	Kan keenya tokkollee hin barbaanne qofa.
I want to do what is right.	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjechuu nan barbaada.
She didn't know how she knew.	Akkamitti akka beektu hin beekne.
He looks like you.	Inni si fakkaata.
The task was not easy.	Hojiin sun salphaa hin turre.
But we don't.	Nuti garuu hin goonu.
But that’s not the case.	Garuu sun akkas miti.
They still search the room.	Ammas kutaa sana keessa ni barbaadu.
Which we all need.	Kan hundi keenya nu barbaachisu.
Nothing is mandatory.	Wanti dirqama ta'e hin jiru.
It can be done.	Hojjechuu danda'a.
In the house.	Mana keessatti.
Only a few times.	Yeroo muraasa qofa.
This is not my business.	Kun dhimma koo miti.
It wasn't who you wanted to be.	Eenyu ta'uu barbaaddu hin turre.
I know what to do.	Maal akka godhu nan beeka.
You have to stay.	Turuu qabda.
We agreed with each other.	Waliin waliin walii galle.
I need sleep.	Hirriba na barbaachisa.
That's how he did it.	Akkasitti godhe.
He thought for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf yaade.
This is our mother.	Kun haadha keenya.
He didn't say much.	Waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
No problem, of course.	Rakkoon hin jiru, beekamaadha.
That wouldn’t work at all.	Sun tasumaa hin hojjetu ture.
Then it didn’t happen.	Sana booda hin taane.
You might say luck.	Carraa jechuu dandeessu.
But we didn't.	Nuti garuu hin goone.
That was a really important interview.	Sun gaaffii fi deebii dhuguma barbaachisaa ture.
I have nothing for you.	Ani homaa siif hin qabu.
It's a good place.	Bakka gaarii dha.
I’m not the only one who thinks that.	Kan akkas yaadu ana qofa miti.
I have something important to tell you.	Waan barbaachisaa sitti himu qaba.
She hadn’t seen him in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa hin argine turte.
I love you guys.	Si jaalladha gurbaa.
They are all here!	Hundi isaanii as jiru!
Is there anyone?	Namni jiraa?
They were everywhere.	Bakka hunda turan.
It's working now.	Amma hojjechaa jira.
She wouldn’t have been able to meet him.	Silaa isa waliin wal arguu hin dandeessu turte.
You know, just like me.	Beektaa akkuma koo.
Someone else made it happen.	Namni biraa akkas akka ta'u godhe.
I want a little dog so bad.	Ani saree xiqqoo akkas hamaa barbaada.
Everything he did was right.	Wanti inni godhe hundi sirrii ture.
Maybe I can't see anything.	Tarii homaa arguu hin danda'u ta'a.
It's unclear exactly what that means right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sirriitti maal jechuu akka ta'e ifa miti.
I knew that, too.	Anis kana nan beeka ture.
I have no one else to help me.	Nama biraa na gargaaru hin qabu.
This seems unlikely.	Kun waan hin taane fakkaata.
No one can do it for us.	Namni nuuf gochuu hin danda'u.
I don’t want to stay in this house.	Mana kana keessa turuu hin barbaadu.
Some people are different.	Namoonni tokko tokko adda.
But he thought more about it.	Inni garuu kana caalaa itti yaade.
I don't know how that works out.	Sun akkamitti akka ta'u hin beeku.
It should be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu qaba.
You're a guy.	Ati gurbaa.
It was different.	Adda ture.
You should have asked her that.	Silaa akkas ishee gaafachuu qabda turte.
We got along so well.	Akka malee waliin walii galle.
But I did that.	Ani garuu akkas godhe.
They have it together.	Waliin qaban.
That he didn't go.	Akka hin deemne.
I really don't understand why though.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e garuu naaf hin galle.
She had work in the morning.	Ganama hojii qabdi turte.
He did so many times.	Yeroo hedduu akkas godhe.
I don’t really think of it that way.	Dhuguma akkasitti hin yaadu.
He would do all the work.	Hojii hunda ni hojjeta ture.
So they may no longer exist.	Kanaaf, kana booda jiraachuu dhiisuu dandaʼu.
You did that.	Ati akkas goote.
You are too good a boy not to be.	Ati garmalee gaarii dha gurbaa akka hin taane.
He may not know it yet, but he needs his mother.	Ammallee beekuu dhiisuu danda'a, garuu haadha isaa isa barbaachisa.
I knew she had to come back.	Deebi'uu akka qabdu nan beeka ture.
I will never do that.	Gonkumaa akkas hin godhu.
I know this is a little bit.	Kun xiqqoo akka ta'e nan beeka.
Wait for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf eegaa.
There was no such thing in my case.	Dhimma koo irratti wanti akkasii hin turre.
It is better not to say anything.	Homaa dubbachuu dhiisuu wayya.
I don't know anything about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku.
In.	Keessa.
That is a very good idea.	Sun yaada baayyee gaarii dha.
He knew she didn’t need to do that.	Isheen akkas gochuun akka hin barbaachifne beeka ture.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
It's time to.	Yeroon itti...
I still have no chance.	Ammas carraa hin qabu.
I don’t have any feelings .	Miira tokkollee hin qabu .
It’s different with me.	Ana waliin adda.
It must be right.	Sirrii ta'uu qaba.
Maybe a little too much.	Tarii xiqqoo garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
Why do you think this happened?	Kun maaliif ta'e jettanii yaaddu?
I never thought this would happen.	Kun ni ta'a jedhee gonkumaa hin yaadu ture.
But there was little of that.	Garuu sana keessaa xiqqoo ture.
They can do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu dandaʼu.
I do it often.	Yeroo baayʼee nan godha.
Better to let it be an accident.	Balaa akka ta'u gochuu wayya.
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
They were all on it.	Hundi isaanii irra turan.
It looked pretty bad in there.	Achi keessaa baayyee hamaa fakkaata ture.
I don't mean that.	Kana jechuu koo miti.
I still think it’s his clothes.	Ammallee uffata isaa natti fakkaata.
If you don’t want to do that.	Yoo akkas gochuu hin barbaanne.
See my answer here.	Deebii koo as ilaalaa.
I love being a mom.	Haadha ta'uu baay'een jaalladha.
It’s all on their circumstances.	Hundi isaa haala isaanii irratti.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
You can't do that.	Kanaan hin dandeessu.
I want a lot more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee barbaada.
He was mine.	Inni kan koo ture.
Someone is exactly right.	Namni tokko sirriitti sirrii dha.
It doesn’t mean we agree.	Walii galle jechuu miti.
We made it work.	Akka hojjetu goone.
That would be pretty bad.	Sun baayyee hamaa ta'a.
There is no one.	Namni hin jiru.
I knew it was a problem.	Rakkoo akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
We have our hands.	Harka keenya qabna.
I just have to know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e qofa beekuu qaba.
I know everything about cars.	Waa'ee konkolaataa hunda nan beeka.
He is very nice.	Inni baay'ee namatti tola.
There is nothing you can do now.	Amma homaa gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
This is not a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa miti.
Which was just now.	Kan amma qofa ture.
I have to go.	Deemuun qaba.
It must be unique.	Adda ta'uu qaba.
I think it’s pretty obvious.	Baayyee ifa natti fakkaata.
This seems like a new reality.	Kun dhugaa haaraa fakkaata.
I couldn’t find any errors.	Dogoggora tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
Him in the car.	Isa konkolaataa keessa.
But they shouldn't have been.	Garuu silaa ta'uu hin qaban turan.
It was his job.	Hojii isaa ture.
But he could have been different.	Inni garuu nama adda taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
It was great as always.	Akkuma yeroo hundumaa guddaa ture.
It wasn’t a question.	Gaaffii hin turre.
She wasn't a crowd.	Isheen namoota baay'ee hin turre.
I mean, they do some good stuff here.	Asitti waan gaarii tokko tokko hojjetu jechuu kooti.
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo miti.
It only took once.	Yeroo tokko qofa fudhate.
I really had no idea what it could be.	Dhuguma maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu ture.
Do you have a dog?	Saree qabduu?
I want you now.	Amma si barbaada.
They didn’t have any time.	Yeroo tokkollee hin qaban turan.
And I was sure of it.	Anis mirkanaa'aa ture.
Special.	Kan adda ta'e.
They will have to go.	Isaan deemuun dirqama ta'a.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
She did nothing of the sort.	Isheen homaa akkasii hin goone.
This would not work.	Kun hin hojjetu ture.
It was a great time.	Yeroon sun yeroo guddaa ture.
He didn't do anything.	Tokkollee hin goone.
I know that’s not good enough.	Sun gaarii akka hin taane nan beeka.
This was a huge mistake.	Kun dogoggora guddaa ture.
It's never going to be that bad.	Gonkumaa akkas hamaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
It wasn’t something they had to do.	Waan isaan gochuu qaban hin turre.
You are right.	Ati sirrii dha.
Not entirely true.	Guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
It is not clear that we can do this.	Kana gochuu akka dandeenyu ifa miti.
It was good, but not great.	Gaarii ture, garuu guddaa hin turre.
You can't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeessu.
Maybe this is about it.	Tarii kun waa'ee kanaa ta'uu danda'a.
I could never do it again.	Kana booda gonkumaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
Exactly what she didn’t want.	Sirriitti waan isheen hin barbaanne.
This if very often a problem.	Kun yoo baay'ee yeroo baay'ee rakkoo ta'e.
She must be who she is now.	Amma eenyu akka taate ta'uu qabdi.
Simple ideas.	Yaada salphaa.
I didn't think of anything else.	Waan biraa hin yaadne.
I'm sorry but that's just it.	Dhiifama garuu akkas qofa.
I said I think so.	Anis yaada jedheen.
This was our mistake.	Kun dogoggora keenya ture.
But he did not make that mistake.	Dogoggora sana garuu hin hojjenne.
That seemed telling.	Sun waan himu fakkaata ture.
I still have some work to do.	Ammallee hojii tokko tokko qaba.
It’s not my problem.	Rakkoo koo miti.
Now, of course, he is gone.	Amma, inni akka hin jirre beekamaadha.
He owned the house.	Mana sana qaba ture.
Not to say anything about me.	Waa'ee koo homaa akka hin dubbanne.
I like that about you.	Waa'ee kee akkas natti tola.
She didn't say why.	Maaliif jettee hin dubbanne.
We were in the same school.	Mana barumsaa tokko keessa turre.
We agreed that everything was fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii akka ta'e irratti walii galle.
Another day, a few hours.	Guyyaa biraa, sa'aatii muraasa.
I have to say, this doesn't look very good.	Ani akkan jedhu, kun baayyee gaarii hin fakkaatu.
But a little of both.	Garuu xiqqoo lamaan keessaa.
This was my favorite.	Kun kan ani jaalladhu ture.
There was no man before him.	Namni isa dura hin turre.
She had to see it for herself.	Ofii ishee arguu qabdi turte.
There wasn't much else he had to do.	Wanti biraa baay'ee inni hojjechuu qabu hin turre.
This is new.	Kun haaraa dha.
He knew exactly what she wanted.	Waan isheen barbaaddu sirriitti beeka ture.
But that is not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas miti.
She has nothing.	Homaa hin qabdu.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
But he didn't do it very often.	Garuu yeroo baay'ee hin godhu ture.
I told him but fine.	Itti hime garuu gaarii.
It’s completely fine.	Guutummaatti gaarii dha.
We don’t have enough money.	Maallaqa gahaa hin qabnu.
He loved to do that.	Kana gochuu jaallatu ture.
That was all good for me.	Sun hundi naaf gaarii ture.
I know how this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka.
You don't need many but you should have two or three.	Baay'ee si hin barbaachisu garuu lama sadii qabaachuu qabda.
He was no longer here.	Kana booda kan as hin turre.
He was in the room.	Kutaa keessa ture.
You know nothing about life right now.	Waa'ee jireenya yeroo ammaa homaa hin beektu.
He wouldn't say how.	Akkamitti hin jedhu ture.
I don't do that.	Ani akkas hin godhu.
He told me exactly how to do it.	Akkamitti akka godhu sirriitti natti hime.
There was none of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
I couldn’t go any further.	Kana caalaa deemuu hin dandeenye.
I don't know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
That was a possibility.	Sun waan taʼuu dandaʼu ture.
I hadn’t noticed it before.	Kanaan dura hin hubanne ture.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Tarii sun waan gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
She's like.	Isheen akka.
But not so much.	Garuu hangas miti.
I’m not the same person you used to know.	Ani nama ati duraan beektu sana miti.
Only you can do this for me.	Kana naaf gochuu kan dandeessu si qofa.
Great location.	Bakka guddaa.
I think that’s a bit of luck.	Sun xiqqoo carraa natti fakkaata.
I can't leave you here.	Asitti si dhiisuu hin danda'u.
But she has to have time.	Garuu yeroo qabaachuu qabdi.
He didn't want her to know.	Akka isheen beektu hin barbaanne.
You can see what you like.	Waan jaallattu arguu dandeessa.
No one else can do it for you.	Namni biraa siif gochuu hin danda'u.
I haven’t seen it yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin argine.
This may be the case.	Kun akkas ta’uu danda’a.
He is with her.	Inni ishee waliin jira.
Not such a bad idea.	Yaada hangas hamaa miti.
They were right to some extent.	Hamma tokko sirrii turan.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Namatti himuu hin qabdu.
We have to work now.	Amma hojjechuu qabna.
After a while he became a man.	Yeroo muraasa booda nama ta'e.
You shouldn't eat too much.	Baay'ee nyaachuu hin qabdu.
He was a really good guy and he had a great hand.	Dhuguma gurbaa gaarii ture harka guddaa qaba ture.
Both of you.	Lamaan keessan.
I want to come back soon.	Dafee deebi'uu barbaada.
But you know how it is.	Garuu akkamitti akka ta'e beekta.
The interview went very well.	Gaaffii fi deebii baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme.
I still have a lot of work to do.	Ammallee hojii baay'een qaba.
I just don't quite know how to do it.	Ani garuu akkamitti akkan godhu sirriitti hin beeku.
And again and again.	Ammas ammas.
Then they were together.	Sana booda waliin turan.
That would have been nice.	Silaa sun gaarii ture.
He didn't speak anymore.	Kana booda hin dubbanne.
There's a lot of truth to it.	Dhugaa baay'een irra jira.
I still have it.	Ammas qaba.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
It is needed more than anything else.	Waan hundumaa caalaa barbaachisa.
You can do it now.	Amma gochuu dandeessa.
Something he never did.	Waan inni gonkumaa hin hojjenne.
We were together all this time.	Yeroo kana hunda waliin turre.
About their sound.	Waa'ee sagalee isaanii.
But I couldn't go back now.	Garuu amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
I think he likes that idea.	Yaada sana waan jaallatu natti fakkaata.
She said it was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture jette.
Not bad so far.	Hanga ammaatti hamaa miti.
Maybe one of them will know.	Tarii isaan keessaa tokko ni beeka ta'a.
There is no real work there.	Hojiin dhugaa achi hin jiru.
Can you give me some money?	Maallaqa tokko tokko naaf kennuu dandeessaa?
I know this voice.	Sagalee kana nan beeka.
Maybe I could come back tonight.	Tarii halkan kana deebi'uu nan danda'a ture.
Maybe you never saw it.	Tarii tasumaa hin argine ta'a.
But then he goes away.	Sana booda garuu ni deema.
He bought a book.	Kitaaba tokko bite.
Otherwise, it does nothing.	Yoo kana hin taane homaa hin godhu.
But he wasn’t home for long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraaf mana hin turre.
Perhaps there is.	Tarii kan jiru ta'uu danda'a.
It was right.	Sirrii ture.
He will definitely answer.	Deebii kennuu isaa hin oolu.
I mean, sure you have.	Akka qabdu mirkanaa'aa jechuu kooti.
This is not necessary, however.	Kun garuu dirqama miti.
This didn't work.	Kun hin hojjenne.
Within a few hours.	Sa'aatii muraasa keessatti.
I hope you don’t do anything important.	Waan barbaachisaa akka hin hojjenne abdiin qaba.
There is none of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
Just us then.	Nu qofa yeroo sana.
It didn't work.	Hin hojjenne.
He was waiting.	Inni eegaa ture.
He had just wanted to play with her.	Ishee waliin taphachuu qofa barbaade ture.
What if it's.	Maal yoo ta'e.
He probably did that.	Inni akkas godhe hin oolu.
That's what I mean.	Kana jechuu kooti.
Tell me your case.	Dhimma kee natti himi.
It took a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
I need her help.	Gargaarsa ishee na barbaachisa.
One of two ways.	Karaa lama keessaa tokko.
But she wouldn’t.	Garuu hin gootu turte.
Great condition, good sound.	Haala guddaa, sagalee gaarii.
I couldn't have asked for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture.
One of you guys?	Isin keessaa tokko?
This is not dangerous.	Kun balaa hin qabu.
I am new to this.	Ani kana irratti haaraa dha.
You know how to eat cat jokes.	Qoosaa saree nyaachuu ni beektu.
She shouldn’t be left alone.	Kophaa ishee turuu hin qabdu.
John had to go.	Yohaannis deemuun dirqama ture.
He becomes a bartender at night.	Halkan nama mana dhugaatii hojjetu ta'a.
You said you had an answer.	Deebii qabda jette.
He is watching you.	Inni si ilaalaa jira.
It all seems a long time ago.	Hundi isaa yeroo dheeraa dura fakkaata.
Then we went for a drink.	Sana booda dhugaatii deemne.
I am now a mother.	Ani amma haadha.
I almost wasn't there.	Ani hin turre jechuun ni danda'ama.
She was a human being.	Isheen nama turte.
He had no chance.	Carraa hin qabu ture.
He didn't.	Hin goone.
I love your voice.	Sagalee kee baay'een jaalladha.
I'm fine being .	Ani gaarii dha ta'uu koo .
They are doing really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
But on the !!!.	Garuu irratti !!!.
You know better than they do.	Isaan caalaa ati beekta.
Not a bad place to be.	Bakka ta'uuf hamaa miti.
Just my luck to have a mother like her.	Carraa koo qofa haadha akka ishee qabaachuu.
That’d be a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ta’a.
I couldn't believe he said that.	Akkas jedhe amanuu hin dandeenye.
Not this time.	Yeroo kana miti.
I mean, you're like that.	Ati akkas jechuu kooti.
Now about the guy.	Amma waa'ee gurbaa sanaa.
But that’s wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora.
He was with two of his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa lama waliin ture.
No one knows.	Namni beeku hin jiru.
It's still not my business.	Ammas dhimma koo miti.
They are great at this.	Isaan kana irratti guddaa dha.
Perhaps none of them happened.	Tarii tokkollee hin taane taʼa.
It always looks so bad.	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti hamaa fakkaata.
But this time things are a little different.	Yeroo kana garuu wanti xiqqoo adda.
It’s just the truth.	Dhugaa qofa.
They needed their parents.	Warra isaanii isaan barbaachisa ture.
I really love it so much.	Dhuguma baay'een jaalladha.
But he did the job.	Garuu hojii sana hojjete.
I was the guy who made it happen.	Ani gurbaa sana akka ta'u godhe ture.
Ridiculous idea, really.	Yaada qoosaa, dhuguma.
I disagreed with him.	Anis isa waliin walii hin galle.
But I wasn't sure why.	Garuu maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
We didn't really have much in common.	Dhuguma waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu hin qabnu turre.
I liked those people very much.	Namoonni sun baayʼee natti tola turan.
He would have had her.	Silaa ishee qaba ture.
It just took a lot of work.	Hojii guddaa qofa fudhate.
It matters.	Dhimma qaba.
We meant to do the work.	Hojii sana hojjechuu jechuu keenya ture.
None of them are that bad.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee akkas hamaa miti.
Life, then nothing.	Jireenya, sana booda homaa miti.
I could see right in there.	Achi keessa sirriitti arguu nan danda'a ture.
He lives up the road.	Karaa ol jiraata.
I don't want you.	Ani si hin barbaadu.
That means some at the same time.	Kana jechuun yeroo wal fakkaatu irratti tokko tokko.
That's exactly what happened.	Kan ta'e sirriitti kanuma.
This is exactly what it is.	Kun sirriitti kanuma.
You are one.	Ati tokko.
He made a lot of money that year.	Bara sanatti maallaqa guddaa argate.
So it was early.	Kanaaf dafee ture.
The interview went very well.	Gaaffii fi deebii baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme.
There is absolutely nothing you can do about this.	Kana irratti wanti ati gochuu dandeessu gonkumaa hin jiru.
Then he realized something else.	Sana booda waan biraa hubate.
He can be a great help to us.	Inni gargaarsa guddaa nuuf taʼuu dandaʼa.
He wanted to know why.	Maaliif akka taʼe beekuu barbaade.
She certainly looks like one right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana tokko akka fakkaattu beekamaadha.
A long time ago now.	Yeroo dheeraa dura amma.
But nobody really wants that.	Garuu namni dhuguma sana barbaadu hin jiru.
I hadn’t known her in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee hin beekne ture.
I don’t want you to do anything for me.	Homaa akka naaf gootu hin barbaadu.
It was never about me.	Waa'ee koo gonkumaa hin turre.
Look for Him.	Isa barbaadaa.
You too .	Ati illee .
They were good people.	Namoota gaarii turan.
Which he certainly didn’t.	Kan inni hin goone beekamaadha.
And I was good at it.	Anis irratti ga'umsa qaba ture.
I want to talk about you.	Waa'ee kee dubbachuu barbaada.
That wasn't going to happen.	Sun ta'uuf hin turre.
He had this.	Kana qaba ture.
I don’t know that they were bad.	Hamaa akka turan hin beeku.
I had nothing to say to her.	Waan isheen jedhu hin qabu ture.
A lot happens here.	Asitti wanti baay'een ni ta'a.
It was good, even.	Gaarii ture, illee.
No way.	Gonkumaa hin ta'u.
It just happens a few times.	Yeroo muraasa qofa ta'a.
I thought we had it.	Qabne natti fakkaate.
may have a slightly.	qabaachuu danda'a.
He still has a home there.	Ammallee achitti mana qaba.
She was there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi turte.
Your name is.	Maqaa kee.
It was just my answer.	Deebii koo qofa ture.
A lot can happen in two months.	Ji'a lama keessatti wanti baay'een ta'uu danda'a.
These people were great.	Namoonni kun guddaa turan.
He was only right about one thing.	Waan tokko qofa irratti sirrii ture.
I wanted to ask, but didn’t have time.	Gaafachuu barbaade, garuu yeroo hin qabu ture.
He said he didn't want to go back.	Deebi'uu akka hin barbaanne dubbateera.
Too loud, too full of myself.	Garmalee sagalee guddaa, garmalee of guutuu.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
Sometimes a little more.	Yeroo tokko tokko xiqqoo caalaa.
We had to do it again.	Ammas gochuu qabna turre.
There were times when you didn’t know where you were.	Yeroon eessa akka jirtu hin beekne ni jira ture.
Telling me things that aren’t.	Waan hin taane natti himuu.
He didn't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himne.
You never know in it long enough.	Yeroo dheeraa gahaa ta'ee keessa hin beektu.
I can't speak to it.	Itti dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I’m not so sure that’s true.	Sun dhugaa ta’uu isaa hangas mirkanaa’aa miti.
Usually not very often.	Yeroo baayyee baayyee miti.
You don’t know that for sure.	Sana mirkanaa’aa hin beektu.
Sounds like a ridiculous amount of money.	Maallaqa qoosaa ta'e fakkaata.
It doesn't help much.	Baayyee hin gargaaru.
She didn’t know why.	Maaliif jettee hin beektu turte.
She doesn't know her name.	Maqaa ishee hin beektu.
We need your feedback.	Yaada keessan nu barbaachisa.
From the workplace.	Bakka hojii irraa.
If it was right, then it's mostly right.	Yoo sirriitti ture, sana booda irra caalaa sirriitti ta'a.
But maybe things really are different now.	Garuu tarii dhuguma wanti jiru amma adda ta'uu danda'a.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
But I couldn't do that.	Ani garuu akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
He is not a human being.	Inni nama miti.
Sometimes it’s just different.	Yeroo tokko tokko adda qofa.
A long, long time ago, something was very different.	Yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa dura, wanti tokko baay’ee adda ture.
There is no time now.	Amma yeroon hin jiru.
Just look at this picture.	Suuraa kana qofa ilaalaa.
It is a very important issue for us.	Nuuf dhimma baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
A great dog.	Saree guddaa.
Only the two of them.	Lamaan isaa qofa.
But it’s not true, not anymore.	Garuu dhugaa miti, kana booda miti.
He would be lucky.	Inni carraa ni ta'a ture.
They were friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota turan.
This one will work.	Inni kun ni hojjeta.
He couldn't do that.	Sana gochuu hin dandeenye.
Goes.	Ni deema.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Namni akkas gochuu barbaade hin jiru.
That’s more of the same.	Sun caalaatti wal fakkaata.
Not only that, but it is inexcusable.	Kana qofa osoo hin taane dhiifama hin qabu.
Everyone needs help.	Namni hundi gargaarsa barbaada.
She said not really.	Dhuguma miti jette.
That is definitely not my intention.	Sun yaada koo akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He knew what he was doing.	Waan hojjetu beeka ture.
There, now you know.	Achitti, amma beekta.
You can do a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu dandeessa.
I said that at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas jedheen ture.
Nothing could be clearer.	Kana caalaa wanti ifa ta’uu danda’u hin jiru.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
Look at yourself.	Of ilaalaa.
Look at what is happening here.	Mee waan asitti ta'aa jiru ilaalaa.
One time out of three it works like this.	Sadii keessaa yeroo tokko akkasitti hojjeta.
He was interested in almost everything.	Waan hundumaa jechuun ni danda’ama fedhii qaba ture.
But this was not the case.	Garuu kana hin turre.
But he never spoke.	Garuu gonkumaa hin dubbanne.
He has friends.	Hiriyyoota qaba.
With someone else.	Nama biraa waliin.
She said she didn't have it.	Hin qabdu jette.
No one said anything good.	Namni waan gaarii hin dubbanne.
You don't need to know.	Beekuu hin barbaachisu.
It would have been a must.	Silaa dirqama ture.
But even that won't be enough.	Garuu sun illee gahaa hin ta'u.
He was here all this time.	Yeroo kana hunda as ture.
You can still do it.	Ammas gochuu dandeessa.
After a while he said another.	Yeroo muraasa booda kan biraa jedhe.
This is just one.	Kun tokko qofa.
Almost no one knows about you.	Waa'ee kee namni beeku hin jiru jechuun ni danda'ama.
He was bigger than me.	Ana caalaa guddaa ture.
He shouldn’t have been here.	Inni as jiraachuu hin qabu ture.
It seems easy.	Salphaa fakkaata.
We don’t have any food.	Nyaata tokkollee hin qabnu.
But maybe they can do something.	Garuu tarii waan tokko hojjechuu danda'u ta'a.
Lots of eyes.	Ija baay'ee.
I don't need it.	Na hin barbaachisu.
But, for sure, we have a long way to go.	Garuu, mirkanaa’aa dha, karaa dheeraa qabna.
This is my room.	Kun kutaa kooti.
One can’t tell.	Namni tokko himuu hin danda’u.
He told me that time and time again.	Sana yeroo yeroon natti hime.
That wasn’t a problem.	Sun rakkoo hin turre.
I’ve never been in it.	Ani keessa turee hin beeku.
I want it to be true.	Dhugaa akka ta'u nan barbaada.
It happened about a week ago.	Gara torban tokko dura ta'e.
I'm making another voice, even a completely different voice and language.	Sagalee biraa hojjechaa jira, sagalee fi afaan guutummaatti adda ta'e illee.
A new car.	Konkolaataa haaraa.
Why are you looking at me like that?	Maaliif akkasitti na ilaalaa jirta?
They know very little about such things.	Waa'ee wantoota akkasii baay'ee xiqqoo beeku.
This isn't about me.	Kun waa'ee koo miti.
She really needs a good time.	Dhuguma yeroo gaarii ishee barbaachisa.
If only this had happened a few hours ago.	Osoo kun sa'aatii muraasa dura ta'ee.
I'm not good at this.	Ani kana irratti ga'umsa hin qabu.
Maybe this is it.	Tarii kana ta'uu danda'a.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Then the problem.	Sana booda rakkoon.
The door to the.	Balbala gara.
You are walking down the street.	Karaa irra deemaa jirta.
But no one asked her.	Garuu namni ishee gaafate hin turre.
Some should do it.	Tokko tokko hojjechuu qaba.
Just wait outside for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ala eegaa qofa.
Must have a car obviously.	Konkolaataa qabaachuu qaba ifaadha.
He was no longer there.	Kana booda achi hin turre.
It was more than enough for us.	Nuuf gahaa ol ture.
Not so much.	Hanga kana miti.
That’s one thing.	Sun waan tokko.
But you can't.	Garuu hin dandeessu.
She didn’t know where she was going.	Eessa akka deemtu hin beektu turte.
It has a big issue.	Dhimma guddaa qaba.
Two years ago.	Waggaa lama dura.
They know where he is.	Bakka inni isheen jirtu beeku.
She was a good person.	Isheen nama gaarii turte.
If it's too good to be true, it's probably true.	Yoo baayyee gaarii ta'e dhugaa ta'uu hin oolu.
There was a chance.	Carraan ture.
She said she was sorry.	Dhiifama jettee.
But we have to do this.	Garuu kana gochuu qabna.
They would be somewhere else entirely.	Guutummaatti bakka biraa ta'u turan.
It's not going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin deemu.
Now that’s not a bad idea.	Amma sun yaada hamaa miti.
He knew there was something special about him.	Isa keessa wanti adda taʼe akka jiru ni beeka ture.
I can't do it.	Ani gochuu hin danda'u.
I’m glad he’s doing it, not me.	Ana osoo hin taane inni hojjechaa jiraachuu isaatti gammadeera.
This is not always the case, however.	Kun yeroo hunda garuu hin ta’u.
I once thought it was so similar.	Yeroo tokko akkasitti wal fakkaata jedheen yaade.
I will always love my mother.	Yeroo hundumaa haadha koo nan jaalladha.
I mean, just one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa jechuu kooti.
Maybe he wasn't.	Tarii inni hin turre ta'a.
That's about it.	Waa'ee isaa kanuma.
They were waiting for his return.	Deebi'uu isaa eegaa turan.
But I can't find him.	Ani garuu isa argachuu hin danda'u.
We are one.	Nuti tokko.
I still don't understand what happened.	Ammallee waan ta'e naaf hin galle.
But then again, this is just a theory.	Garuu sana booda ammas, kun yaada qofa.
A couple of days.	Guyyaa lama lama.
I'm pretty sure it was him.	Isa akka ture baay'een mirkanaa'adha.
But nothing is so simple.	Garuu wanti akkas salphaa ta'e tokkollee hin jiru.
There is no problem.	Rakkoon hin jiru.
He just wanted her to know.	Akka isheen beektu qofa barbaade.
You know it very well.	Ati akka gaariitti beekta.
What could be the problem.	Rakkoon kun maal ta'uu danda'a.
He knew what she had to do.	Waan isheen gochuu qabdu beeka ture.
But, that's really not much.	Garuu, sun dhuguma baay'ee miti.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
They were beyond that.	Isaan sanaa ol turan.
Everyone in this house has to work.	Mana kana keessa namni hundi hojjechuu qaba.
It’s not easy.	Salphaa miti.
He was great now.	Inni amma guddaa ture.
Like, really quickly.	Akka, dhuguma dafee.
She is still my mother.	Ammallee haadha kooti.
You’re not going for me.	Ati naaf hin deemtu.
This was not her room.	Kun kutaa ishee hin turre.
I never did it.	Ani gonkumaa hin goone.
You can’t do anything.	Waan tokko hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
That must be great.	Sun guddaa taʼuu qaba.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
I didn’t know where he was.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku ture.
Incomplete ideas.	Yaada guutuu hin taane.
People know who you are.	Namoonni eenyu akka taate ni beeku.
It's just not happening.	Ta'uu dhiisuu qofa.
You have to live in the present moment.	Yeroo ammaa keessa jiraachuu qabda.
But not in this house.	Garuu mana kana keessatti miti.
He may be the one.	Inni taʼuu dandaʼa.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
He has been doing this for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf kana gochaa ture.
So far this has not happened yet.	Hanga ammaatti kun ammallee hin taane.
We need it.	Nu barbaachisa.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
Inside the.	Keessatti.
You don't know us.	Ati nu hin beektu.
Then it won't happen.	Sana booda hin ta'u.
You don’t need anything else.	Waan biraa si hin barbaachisu.
I can only talk about them.	Waa'ee isaanii qofa dubbachuu danda'a.
I know you love him .	Akka isa jaallattu nan beeka .
They will still be.	Ammas ni ta'u.
I have no answers but questions.	Gaaffii malee deebii hin qabu.
I think it’s a mistake.	Dogoggora natti fakkaata.
There is a problem.	Rakkoon jira.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You said you were in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirta jette.
Other than that, there really is nothing.	Kana malee dhuguma wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
I think he is, a little bit.	Inni akkas jedheen yaada, xiqqoo.
That’s really good, of course.	Sun dhuguma gaarii dha, beekamaadha.
He wanted to live there.	Achi jiraachuu barbaade.
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
Who he was.	Eenyu akka ture.
You never had to know the answer.	Deebii isaa gonkumaa beekuu hin qabdu turte.
Tell me what he said.	Waan jedhe natti himi.
There will still be work.	Ammas hojiin ni jiraata.
You need to know this.	Kana beekuu qabda.
It still exists.	Ammas jira.
If it is different	Yoo adda ta'e .
He loves a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee ni jaallata.
Not so much.	Hamma kana miti.
She was where she belonged.	Isheen bakka isheen qabdu turte.
But they can do it.	Garuu gochuu danda'u.
I'll go tomorrow.	Boru nan deema.
This cannot be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin danda'u.
We are in a lot of trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa jirra.
That you don’t want to be here.	Akka ati as jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
It was many years.	Waggaa baay'ee ture.
I know better than you.	Si caalaa nan beeka.
He asked her a question.	Gaaffii tokko ishee gaafate.
I think that’s a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa natti fakkaata.
But again, this has never been a big problem.	Garuu ammas, kun rakkoo guddaa ta’ee hin beeku.
Not exactly sure.	Sirriitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
It looked good.	Gaarii fakkaata ture.
She was younger than me.	Isheen na caalaa xiqqoo turte.
This is certainly not true.	Kun dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I don't understand.	Naaf hin galle.
But perhaps that would be fine.	Tarii garuu sun gaarii taʼa.
Clearly, that is the case.	Akkas akka taʼe ifaadha.
I'm sorry to say that.	Akkas jechuu kootti dhiifama.
She should have seen it.	Silaa arguu qabdi turte.
Sorry you’re not into it.	Dhiifama ati keessa hin jirtu.
This was not a man who did not often tell his wife.	Kun nama yeroo baay'ee haadha manaa isaatti hin himu hin turre.
Really, that's pretty good.	Dhuguma, sun baayyee gaarii dha.
That's all.	Kanuma qofa.
I told him again.	Ammas itti hime.
Time didn’t seem to matter at all.	Yeroon tasumaa barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu ture.
Everyone wants to feel good.	Namni hundi miira gaarii qabaachuu barbaada.
Can't you see what's going on here?	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru arguu hin dandeessu?
In one case.	Haala tokko keessatti.
I think about her all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee ishee nan yaada.
People say that.	Namoonni akkas jedhu.
I don’t know if he was.	Inni ture moo hin turre hin beeku.
Neither is great right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana lamaan isaaniiyyuu guddaa miti.
They need to respond to this problem.	Rakkoo kanaaf deebii kennuu qabu.
You don't know how much.	Meeqa akka ta'e hin beektu.
So I’m working while going to school.	Kanaaf osoo mana barumsaa deemu hojjechaa jira.
We need to help her.	Ishee gargaaruu qabna.
Not all of them have it.	Hundi isaanii hin qaban.
Like, she couldn't believe it.	Akka, isheen amanuu hin dandeenye.
I don’t know who it came from.	Eenyu irraa akka dhufe hin beeku.
She had my hand in hers.	Harka koo harka ishee keessa qabdi turte.
Except, it wasn’t perfect.	Malee, guutuu hin turre.
You never have it again.	Kana booda gonkumaa hin qabdu.
We had to get as much as we could.	Hamma dandeenyu argachuu qabna turre.
I don't want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaadu.
You know, real me.	Beektaa, ana dhugaa.
Not much else.	Waan biraa baay'ee miti.
Everything worked fine before that.	Sana dura wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta ture.
But then, she didn’t have to.	Garuu sana booda, isheen dirqama hin turre.
He is not there right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana achi hin jiru.
I don't know what that would be.	Sun maal akka ta'u hin beeku.
So far everything works fine.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I don’t do it.	Hin godhu.
Everything seemed fine again.	Ammas wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
It just seemed like so much.	Waan baay'ee qofa fakkaata ture.
You will never do it.	Yoomiyyuu hin gootu.
He lives alone in a small house.	Mana xiqqoo tokko keessa kophaa isaa jiraata.
Not if you don’t want to.	Yoo hin barbaanne miti.
Things are not always bad.	Yeroo hunda wanti hamaa hin ta'u.
Not being, it can never really be.	Ta'uu dhiisuu, gonkumaa dhuguma ta'uu hin danda'u.
But he couldn't do it.	Garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
He was certain of that.	Sana irratti mirkanaa’aa ture.
I was, really.	Ani ture, dhuguma.
But you just can’t.	Garuu hin dandeessu qofa.
We are doing a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjechaa jirra.
Maybe it's true most of the time.	Tarii yeroo baay'ee dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
But he wasn't there.	Garuu achi hin turre.
Very different and very similar.	Baay'ee adda fi baay'ee wal fakkaata.
You know, they're doing a lot right now.	Beektaa yeroo ammaa kana waan baay'ee hojjechaa jiru.
But it wasn’t a car.	Garuu konkolaataa hin turre.
Saying what I want to say.	Waanan jechuu barbaadu dubbachuu.
He was probably right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu hin oolu.
There’s really nothing more.	Dhuguma kana caalaa hin jiru.
You can’t live without her.	Ishee malee jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
I can't see it clearly.	Ani sirriitti arguu hin danda'u.
She’s always been like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas turte.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Garuu hin dandeenye, ammallee miti.
He was a name, of course.	Inni maqaa akka ture beekamaadha.
It has been my whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu ta'ee jira.
I don't want to live like that.	Akkas jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
If not who, he knew then.	Eenyu yoo hin taane yeroo sana beeka ture.
It’s never easy.	Gonkumaa salphaa miti.
But you are right.	Garuu ati sirrii dha.
I don’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku.
But this was more than great.	Garuu kun guddaa caalaa ture.
So he didn’t have it.	Kanaaf hin qabu ture.
Maybe she didn't.	Tarii isheen hin goone ta'a.
Look at this guy.	Mee ilaalaa gurbaa kana.
I shouldn’t have commented.	Silaa yaada kennuu hin qabu ture.
But if she doesn’t.	Garuu yoo isheen hin goone.
We all agreed that we had.	Hundi keenya akka qabnu irratti walii galle.
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
It does just fine on its own.	Ofii isaatiin gaarii qofa hojjeta.
I don’t know how it works, but it does.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu hin beeku, garuu ni hojjeta.
I told him so, many times.	Akkas itti hime, yeroo baay'ee.
I have no idea who she is.	Eenyu akka taate yaada hin qabu.
They are working around here today.	Har'a asitti naannoo hojjechaa jiru.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
Not much, but some.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane tokko tokko.
I don’t say it.	Hin jedhu.
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.	Boru maaltu akka ta'u hin beeku.
But this, this is different.	Garuu kun, kun adda.
It was the book he wanted.	Kitaaba inni barbaade ture.
Maybe she had.	Tarii qabdi turte.
He must have been waiting for her.	Ishee eegaa ture ta'uu qaba.
She had a lot going on, before him.	Waan baay'ee deemaa ture qabdi turte, isa dura.
Out again this morning.	Har'a ganama ammas ba'e.
But now the inevitable had to happen.	Amma garuu wanti hin oolle ta'uu qaba ture.
He was there to help him.	Isa gargaaruuf achi ture.
No one wanted to know anything.	Namni homaa beekuu hin barbaanne.
But he never had a chance.	Garuu carraa argate hin beeku.
Then he came.	Sana booda dhufe.
Find out how it happened!.	Akkamitti akka ta'e barbaadaa!.
She had to be.	Ta'uu qabdi turte.
Most of the time we were just around.	Yeroo baayyee naannoo sana qofa turre.
I can’t seem to help it.	Ani waanan gargaaruu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
Then, it was his night.	Sana booda, halkan isaa ture.
. . . .	.
That's very different.	Sun baayyee adda.
I know you think we don’t fit.	Akka nuti hin galle natti fakkaattu nan beeka.
I hope it comes soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti akka dhufu abdiin qaba.
I don't think it's good.	Gaarii natti hin fakkaatu.
But he couldn’t have his way.	Garuu karaa isaa qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
It was easy.	Salphaa ture.
He certainly didn’t stay here.	Asitti akka hin turre beekamaadha.
So stay tuned for me.	Kanaaf na eegaa.
There’s always next year.	Yeroo hundumaa bara dhufu jira.
It shouldn't be too much.	Baay'ee ta'uu hin qabu.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
Now you can do it.	Amma ni dandeessa.
So it seemed.	Kanaaf fakkaata ture.
People think more of other things.	Namoonni waan biraa caalaatti yaadu.
It didn't look like much.	Baay'ee hin fakkaatu ture.
You should all come.	Hundi keessan dhufuu qabdu.
I should say no more.	Kana caalaa dubbachuu hin qabu.
But I will say this.	Ani garuu kana nan jedha.
Why you should do it.	Maaliif gochuu qabda.
It was nothing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti homaa hin turre.
No one was there at the time	Yeroo sanatti namni tokkollee hin turre
None of them are here with you.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee as si waliin hin jiru.
But he couldn’t, not quite yet.	Garuu hin dandeenye, ammallee guutummaatti miti.
No one knows.	Namni beeku hin jiru.
He said he had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee akka hin qabne dubbateera.
There were many of them.	Isaan baay'ee turan.
You have to do your best.	Waan dandeessu hunda gochuu qabda.
Indeed, there is.	Dhuguma, jira.
That’s what you expect.	Kanuma eegaa.
I know him better than you do.	Ani si caalaa isa beeka.
He was a teacher.	Barsiisaa ture.
But she didn't think so.	Isheen garuu akkas hin yaadne.
Just finding the time and space.	Yeroo fi bakka argachuu qofa.
Again, again, again.	Ammas, ammas.
No one ever thought this would happen.	Namni kun ni taʼa jedhee yaade hin beeku.
It has a great sound.	Sagalee guddaa qaba.
He didn’t make a mistake.	Dogoggora hin hojjenne.
This was a great time.	Yeroon kun yeroo guddaa ture.
You’re just trying to help.	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa jirta.
She should have known that.	Silaa sana beekuu qabdi turte.
I probably should have.	Ani tarii qabaachuu qaba.
I would love for you to do that.	Akkas yoo goote baay'een jaalladha.
I'm sure he came out a lot.	Inni baay'ee akka ba'e mirkanaa'adha.
It would be a long answer.	Deebii dheeraa ta'a.
She certainly was.	Isheen akka turte beekamaadha.
It seems to be only one way.	Karaa tokko qofa fakkaata.
But maybe he didn't.	Garuu tarii inni hin taane ta'a.
But this has its obvious dangers.	Garuu kun balaa isaa ifa ta’e qaba.
We have everything.	Waan hundumaa qabna.
They can see this.	Kana arguu danda'u.
He didn’t look good.	Inni gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
I have to do what is necessary.	Waan barbaachisu gochuun qaba.
Hopefully that was of some help.	Sun gargaarsa tokko tokko akka ta'e abdii qabna.
It has been very rarely.	Baayyee yeroo muraasaaf ta'ee jira.
He wasn’t that great.	Inni hangas guddaa hin turre.
I didn’t know them.	Ani isaan hin beeku ture.
This is my question.	Kun gaaffii kooti.
It was a great idea.	Yaada guddaa ture.
I didn't know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
But there is a problem.	Garuu rakkoon jira.
It was only for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa ture.
I hope he forgives me.	Dhiifama akka naaf godhu abdiin qaba.
We both have parts to play.	Lamaan keenyayyuu kutaa taphachuu qabna.
You already have more than enough reason to leave.	Duraan sababa gahaa ol ta'ee deemtu qabda.
I wondered how he did it.	Akkamitti godhe jedheen yaade.
Now that's how I go.	Amma akkas nan deema.
I couldn’t find my car.	Konkolaataa koo argachuu hin dandeenye.
Everything was possible.	Wanti hundi ni danda’ama ture.
Time is not money.	Yeroon qarshii miti.
But there has to be something.	Garuu waan tokko jiraachuu qaba.
He can’t care less about it.	Inni waa’ee isaa dhimma tokkollee qabaachuu hin danda’u.
It must be said.	Jechuun dirqama.
It’s just a matter of time.	Yeroo qofa.
Nothing matters anymore.	Kana booda wanti barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru.
She was little here.	Isheen halkan xiqqoo turte.
That was a long one.	Sun dheeraa ture.
That might tell us something.	Sun waan tokko nutti himuu danda'a.
People need to know they’re coming here.	Namoonni as dhufuu isaanii beekuu qabu.
It doesn’t matter what you want.	Waan barbaaddu homaa hin qabu.
I didn’t say anything, of course.	Ani homaa hin dubbanne, beekamaadha.
One other question.	Gaaffii biraa tokko.
She doesn’t do it .	Isheen hin gootu .
The real life.	Jireenya dhugaa.
But there didn’t seem to be a chance.	Garuu carraan waan jiru hin fakkaatu ture.
Another one tomorrow.	Kan biraa boru.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
He is treating them well.	Akka gaariitti isaan ilaalaa jira.
His day was clear!	Guyyaa isaa ifa ta'e!
It was a good question.	Gaaffii gaarii ture.
In this way, please.	Haala kanaan maaloo.
You never have time.	Yoomiyyuu yeroo hin qabdu.
That is not ours.	Sun kan keenya miti.
Everything else was fine.	Wanti biraa hundi gaarii ture.
He was good to me.	Inni naaf gaarii ture.
I really wanted a girl.	Intala tokko baay'een barbaada ture.
This is an important question.	Kun gaaffii barbaachisaa dha.
With life together.	Jireenya waliin.
But someone must.	Garuu namni tokko dirqama.
None of them were probably trying.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee yaalaa hin turre ta'uu hin oolu.
So he hesitated to answer.	Kanaaf deebii kennuu irraa duubatti jedhe.
He thought he was doing exactly what was needed.	Waan barbaachisu sirriitti waan hojjechaa jiru itti fakkaate.
You are not one of us.	Ati nu keessaa tokko miti.
I think they are wrong.	Isaan dogoggora natti fakkaatu.
You are not required to do any of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee gochuun si irraa hin barbaachisu.
You have to have it.	Ati qabaachuu qabda.
Why, why, why.	Maaliif, maaliif, maaliif.
I'm thinking about it.	Ani itti yaada.
You have to be the one to make things happen.	Wanti tokko akka ta'u kan godhu si ta'uu qabda.
All he needs is money.	Wanti isaaf barbaachisu maallaqa qofa.
They know you love them.	Akka isaan jaallattu ni beeku.
That’s all this could be.	Kun hundi kanuma ta’uu danda’a.
Is there a time when everything is right?	Yeroon wanti hundi sirrii taʼe jiraa?
You can tell them it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa itti himuu dandeessa.
He wanted to.	Inni barbaade.
I do.	Nan godha.
We both needed it.	Lamaan keenyayyuu nu barbaachisa ture.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
This is an important thing.	Kun waan barbaachisaa dha.
She had a daughter.	Intala tokko qabdi turte.
It’s not great.	Guddaa miti.
I was there, too.	Anis achi ture.
So, he did nothing.	Kanaaf, homaa hin goone.
But he had to repeat.	Garuu irra deebi'uu qaba ture.
They are all different.	Hundi isaanii adda adda.
I think he's right.	Inni sirrii natti fakkaata.
It can help you.	Si gargaaruu danda'a.
But they were doing fine without him.	Isa malee garuu gaarii hojjechaa turan.
He wanted his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa barbaade.
I couldn't say it.	Jechuu hin dandeenye.
It’s really not like anything else.	Dhuguma akka waan biraa miti.
Two days to be exact.	Guyyaa lama sirriitti yoo dubbanne.
They are often very good at doing this themselves without our help.	Yeroo baay’ee gargaarsa keenya malee ofii isaanii kana gochuu irratti baay’ee ga’umsa qabu.
I think of him as my father.	Ani akka abbaa kootti isa yaada.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
He wouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas hin godhu ture.
They are extremely loud.	Garmalee sagalee guddaa qabu.
Just do your job.	Hojii kee hojjechuu qofa.
Very good answer.	Deebii baayyee gaarii ta'e.
The problem met.	Rakkoon wal arge.
This was obvious.	Kun ifa ture.
I know a lot about her, but certainly not everything.	Waa'ee ishee waan baay'een beeka, garuu waan hundumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Now everyone has one.	Amma namni hundi tokko qaba.
They weren’t there.	Isaan achi hin turre.
She didn’t want you to know this.	Kana akka ati beektu hin barbaaddu turte.
I don’t want you to care less about me.	Akka ati xiqqoo naaf yaaddu hin barbaadu.
They don’t interact with each other.	Waliin wal hin qaban.
Not in this room, in this house, in this life.	Kutaa kana keessatti, mana kana keessatti, jireenya kana keessatti miti.
That was a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ture.
It’s a name.	Maqaa dha.
Just a little longer.	Xiqqoo dheeraa qofa.
All the lights in every room.	Ifa kutaa hunda keessa jiru hunda.
Probably the biggest mistake of my life.	Tarii dogoggora guddaa jireenya koo keessatti ta'uu danda'a.
Their whole lives.	Jireenya isaanii guutuu.
Time, that’s the problem.	Yeroon, rakkoon jiru kanuma.
We just couldn’t live together.	Waliin jiraachuu qofa hin dandeenye.
I looked at the girl.	Anis intala sana ilaale.
Luck is not a reason.	Carraan sababa miti.
Not that it was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture jechuu miti.
You need to know where it is.	Eessa akka jiru beekuu qabda.
I didn’t want it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin barbaanne.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
And I said, 'It is.	Anis akkas jedheen.
More than we were before.	Kan duraan turre caalaa.
I would have loved him.	Silaa isa jaalladha ture.
Very good idea.	Yaada baayyee gaarii ta'e.
I don't think it will.	Hin ta'u jedheen yaada.
In this picture.	Suuraa kana irratti.
He didn't speak.	Hin dubbanne.
You don’t do it.	Ati hin gootu.
But nothing happens.	Garuu wanti ta'u hin jiru.
I must be doing my job.	Hojii koo hojjechaa jiraachuu qaba.
Except for a few things.	Waan muraasa malee.
You are doing two jobs.	Hojii lama hojjechaa jirta.
I didn’t want to see him in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti isa arguu hin barbaadu ture.
You made them.	Ati isaan goote.
I’m looking for that cart.	Gaarii sana barbaadaa jira.
I could have helped.	Gargaaruu nan dandaʼa ture.
But they are out there.	Garuu isaan ala jiru.
She is so tall.	Isheen akkas dheeraa dha.
We were in a lot.	Baayyee keessa turre.
I didn’t think it was right.	Sirrii natti hin fakkaatu ture.
I don't have many.	Baay'een hin qabu.
I don’t think you should, you know.	Akkas gochuu qabdu natti hin fakkaatu, beekta.
From both of you.	Lamaan keessan irraa.
But there is nothing on this one except my name.	Garuu isa kana irratti maqaa koo malee wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
There was nothing at all.	Tasumaa wanti tokko hin turre.
This was the real one.	Kun isa dhugaa ture.
She is very nice.	Isheen baayyee namatti tola.
But he is not like that.	Garuu inni akkas miti.
None of that matters.	Sana keessaa tokkollee barbaachisaa miti.
I couldn’t see any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
Like many others.	Akkuma hedduu.
Then he had an idea.	Sana booda yaada tokko qaba ture.
Your shoes of hope.	Kophee abdii keessan.
But you are right.	Garuu ati sirrii dha.
I wouldn't have been able to say quite what.	Silaa guutummaatti maal jechuu hin danda'u ture.
No easy answer there.	Achitti deebii salphaa hin qabu.
Nothing came out.	Wanti ba'e hin jiru.
This was not inevitable.	Kun waan hin oolle hin turre.
He wasn't much older than me.	Inni baay'ee na caalaa hin turre.
I don’t want to do this anymore.	Kana booda kana gochuu hin barbaadu.
Just like you were.	Akkuma ati turte.
He looked back involuntarily.	Fedhii isaa malee duubatti ilaale.
We can't make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuu hin dandeenyu.
We promised to do it.	Akka goonu waadaa galle.
If you were there, you might.	Osoo achi turte ta'a.
You should have asked me.	Silaa na gaafachuu qabda turte.
It has never been higher.	Kana caalaa ol ta'ee hin beeku.
It would be enough, most likely.	Silaa gahaa ta'a, baay'ee hin oolu.
But there is no one here.	Garuu asitti namni hin jiru.
He did nothing there.	Achitti homaa hin goone.
Nothing real, nothing helpful.	Wanti dhugaa hin jiru, wanti gargaaru hin jiru.
Living in his car.	Konkolaataa isaa keessa jiraachuu.
Is this even human ?.	Kun nama illee ta'aa ?.
That shouldn't be the case though.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu garuu.
To some extent, they still exist.	Hamma tokko ammas jiru.
But that was a great if.	Garuu sun yoo guddaa ture.
This is all good.	Kun hundi gaarii dha.
That she can do it.	Akka isheen gochuu dandeessu.
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
Maybe there is hope again.	Tarii ammas abdiin jiraachuu danda'a.
Was it a little early.	Xiqqoo dafee turee.
You have your friends.	Hiriyyoota kee qabda.
Can't be too bad.	Garmalee hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
At great risk.	Balaa guddaa irratti.
I was hoping this would tell me.	Kun akka naaf jedhu abdiin qaba ture.
A good guy.	Gurbaa gaarii.
More like their parents.	Caalaatti warra isaanii fakkaatu.
He knew about it.	Waa'ee isaa ni beeka ture.
I just didn’t want to do my homework.	Hojii manaa koo hojjechuu qofa hin barbaanne.
That seems too simple.	Sun garmalee salphaa fakkaata.
He lived in a good house.	Mana gaarii keessa jiraata ture.
But there was nothing there .	Garuu wanti achi hin turre .
I don't think she likes him either.	Isheen illee waan isa jaallattu natti hin fakkaatu.
There is no time to do anything.	Yeroon homaa gochuuf hin jiru.
I need your help here.	Gargaarsa keessan asitti barbaada.
In a little while we will.	Yeroo xiqqoo booda ni...
That’s not the answer.	Sun deebii miti.
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
There was none of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
If it's really that important to you, then you can go.	Yoo dhuguma siif hangas barbaachisaa ta'e, sana booda deemuu dandeessa.
So, you didn’t tell anyone.	Kanaaf, ati namatti hin himne.
That may not be entirely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I don’t need any of it.	Tokkollee na hin barbaachisu.
He is not the same.	Inni tokko miti.
He says he likes it.	Natti tola jedha.
It doesn't matter now.	Amma dhimma hin qabu.
But he was happy.	Inni garuu gammade.
It wasn’t just this time.	Yeroo kana qofa hin turre.
But, he didn’t.	Garuu, hin goone.
It was happening.	Ta'aa ture.
But it must be.	Garuu ta'uu qaba.
It looked like it had to exist.	Jiraachuu akka qabu fakkaata ture.
It quickly became serious.	Dafee hamaa ta'e.
Maybe it will happen.	Tarii ni ta'a.
I didn't understand what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle.
She had no idea what she was in for.	Maal keessa akka jirtu yaada hin qabdu turte.
It won't be long now.	Amma dheeraa hin ta'u.
The job was without any problems.	Hojiin sun rakkoo tokkollee kan hin qabne ture.
I don't know this guy.	Gurbaa kana hin beeku.
She made that suggestion to me.	Yaada sana naaf goote.
It has a slight issue.	Dhimma xiqqoo qaba.
He’s just himself.	Inni ofii isaa qofa.
He had a good case.	Dhimma gaarii qaba ture.
It was at that time.	Yeroo sanatti ture.
That’s a good girl.	Sun intala gaarii dha.
He doesn’t make that mistake again.	Ammas dogoggora sana hin hojjetu.
Sometimes just two.	Yeroo tokko tokko lama qofa.
But they’re not the only ones.	Garuu isaan qofa miti.
He’s been in it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf keessa jira.
It’s not something you can buy.	Waan bitachuu dandeessu miti.
Now we knew we were right.	Amma sirrii akka taane beekne.
How can he do that.	Akkamitti akkas gochuu danda'a.
All night sometimes.	Halkan guutuu yeroo tokko tokko.
This was not who she was.	Kun eenyu akka taate hin turre.
This was exactly that.	Kun sirriitti kanuma ture.
Maybe a little earlier.	Tarii xiqqoo dura ta'uu danda'a.
That’s not always true.	Sun yeroo hunda dhugaa miti.
I could do that.	Kana gochuu nan dandaʼa ture.
It certainly wasn’t new.	Haaraa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I think everyone is just nice.	Namni hundi namatti tola qofa natti fakkaata.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
That's not very good.	Sun baayyee gaarii miti.
He seemed to need that very much.	Waan akkasii baayʼee isa barbaadu fakkaata ture.
I think it’s just great.	Guddaa qofa natti fakkaata.
I'm the one who has to ask.	Kan gaafachuu qabu ana.
Again he said nothing.	Ammas homaa hin dubbanne.
Everything was in place.	Wanti hundi bakka isaa ture.
He is my dog.	Inni saree kooti.
So far it hasn’t gone yet.	Hanga ammaatti ammallee hin deemne.
This can't be, it can't be true.	Kun ta'uu hin danda'u, dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Most people are not like that.	Namoonni baay'een akkas miti.
Maybe she had too.	Tarii isheen illee qabdi turte ta'a.
This one doesn’t need comment.	Inni kun yaada hin barbaadu.
But he was right.	Inni garuu sirrii ture.
Maybe in the last hour.	Tarii sa'aatii darbe keessa ta'uu danda'a.
It wasn't going to be easy.	Salphaa ta'uuf hin turre.
You are very special to us.	Ati baay'ee adda nuuf.
One, where you are.	Tokko, bakka jirtu.
The true house of the house.	Mana dhugaa manaa.
This will be my reality next year.	Kun bara dhufu dhugaa koo ta'a.
That was our main course.	Sun nyaata guddaa keenya ture.
I can't believe she's been looking for me all this time.	Yeroo kana hunda na barbaadaa akka turte amanuu hin danda'u.
They stayed there for three days.	Achitti guyyaa sadii turan.
You are more than that.	Ati kana caalaa jirta.
He doesn't love you.	Inni si hin jaallatu.
It could have been worse.	Silaa kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
She was like that.	Isheen akkas turte.
I have a couple of new ones.	Haaraa tokko lama qaba.
There is absolutely no excuse for this.	Kanaaf sababni gonkumaa hin jiru.
But nothing seems to work.	Garuu wanti hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
But this isn’t really a book.	Garuu kun dhuguma kitaaba miti.
They are good people.	Namoota gaarii dha.
I'm not so sure.	Hangas mirkanaa'aa miti.
Everything that was there.	Waan achi ture hunda.
You can't do it like that.	Akkasitti gochuu hin dandeessu.
More than you think you know.	Kan ati beekta jettee yaaddu caalaa.
I didn't know about that.	Waa'ee sanaa hin beeku ture.
Shouldn't see much.	Baay'ee arguu hin qabu.
He needs to know what's going on here.	Asitti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba.
I was that guy.	Ani gurbaa sana ture.
He is in a bad place.	Bakka hamaa keessa jira.
I wanted to.	Ani barbaade.
He may have it.	Inni qabaachuu danda'a.
In those days this was his neighborhood.	Bara sanatti kun naannoo isaa ture.
But then there is no problem.	Sana booda garuu rakkoon hin jiru.
A time, not a place.	Yeroo tokko, bakka osoo hin taane.
Which was, better.	Kan ture, wayya.
You must come back with us.	Nu waliin deebi'uu qabdu.
They were bad for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hamaa turan.
It's not about much.	Waa'ee baay'ee miti.
I don’t want anyone to know.	Namni akka beeku hin barbaadu.
Only this is a new reality.	Kun qofa kun dhugaa haaraa dha.
I couldn’t help him.	Isa gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
It was in my car.	Konkolaataa koo keessa ture.
But it will be bad.	Garuu hamaa ta'a.
So you have two problems.	Kanaaf rakkoo lama qabda.
I really don’t want to do anything else.	Dhuguma kana malee homaa gochuu hin barbaadu.
We hope it helps.	Akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
My children.	Ijoollee koo.
He was just good at making pictures.	Suuraa hojjechuu qofa irratti ga'umsa qaba ture.
Medical problems.	Rakkoo yaalaa.
He often spoke her mind.	Yeroo baay'ee yaada ishee dubbata ture.
Who knows what else is in store?.	Kan biraa maaltu akka jiru eenyutu beeka?.
It’s usually not just one simple thing.	Yeroo baay’ee waan salphaa tokko qofa miti.
I didn’t get too emotional.	Garmalee miira keessa hin galle.
I don’t know what they were.	Maal akka turan hin beeku.
He's becoming a husband.	Abbaa manaa ta'aa jira.
I like that a lot.	Sun baayyee natti tola.
I am the life.	Ani jireenya.
But if it were true.	Garuu osoo dhugaa ta'ee.
But it does more than that.	Kana caalaa garuu hojjeta.
She has something she’s interested in.	Waan isheen fedhii qabdu qabdi.
He would have loved this.	Silaa kana ni jaallata ture.
Give frequent and prolonged feedings.	Nyaata yeroo baay’ee fi yeroo dheeraa kennuu.
I checked my watch again.	Ammas sa'aatii koo ilaale.
I just couldn’t get that feeling.	Miira sana argachuu qofa hin dandeenye.
That would have been nice.	Silaa sun gaarii ture.
Then his hands.	Sana booda harka isaa.
I think it will go very well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee ni deema jedheen yaada.
We certainly didn’t.	Nuti akkas hin goone beekamaadha.
None of them are there.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
How can this be the case?	Kun akkamitti ta’uu danda’a?
Time for the new parents.	Yeroon warra haaraa.
I don't know about it, yet.	Waa'ee isaa hin beeku, ammallee.
Too much was still unclear.	Garmalee ammallee ifa hin turre.
I know what is going to happen there.	Waan achitti ta'uuf jiru nan beeka.
It took a bit of work though.	Hojii xiqqoo fudhate garuu.
It’s not just mine.	Kan koo qofa miti.
What is important is that .	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e .
Which he did, of course.	Kan inni godhe, beekamaadha.
I don't know how many times.	Yeroo meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku.
This involves thought.	Kun yaada of keessaa qaba.
But it is not like that at all.	Garuu tasumaa akkas miti.
Good.	Gaarii.
It’s really not necessary.	Dhuguma hin barbaachisu.
I really think something is wrong.	Dhuguma waan tokko dogoggora natti fakkaata.
Someone said it was a drink.	Namni tokko dhugaatii ture jedhe.
We were in a new place.	Bakka haaraa keessa turre.
There was nothing else we could do or say.	Wanti biraa gochuu fi jechuu dandeenyu hin turre.
It couldn't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeenye.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
We went everywhere together.	Bakka hunda waliin deemne.
Not bad, he thought.	Hamaa miti jedhee yaade.
A very good person.	Nama baayyee gaarii.
I’m really sorry, but .	Dhuguma dhiifama, garuu .
They know that he is still gone.	Ammas akka hin jirre beeku.
I was expecting this.	Kana eegaa ture.
As in two.	Akkuma lama keessatti.
You can’t find them.	Isaan argachuu hin dandeessu.
I don’t think anyone noticed.	Namni tokkollee waan hubate natti hin fakkaatu.
We need to know who did it.	Eenyu akka godhe beekuu qabna.
Sometimes they were bar mates.	Yeroo tokko tokko hiriyyoota mana dhugaatii turan.
We had a bit of a thing.	Xiqqoo waan tokko qabna turre.
It was a time of great hope.	Yeroon sun yeroo abdii guddaa qabu ture.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee.
This is something new.	Kun waan haaraa dha.
He was the one.	Inni ture.
I don't know what you're going to do.	Maal akka gootu hin beeku.
He went out this morning.	Har'a ganama ba'e.
It was you.	Si ture.
In other words, that is still correct.	Kana jechuun sun ammas sirrii dha.
Wait, that was it.	Eegaa, sun ture.
It may not be like me, it may not be like you.	Akka koo ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a, akka kee ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
They haven’t had it before.	Kanaan dura hin qaban.
Not always the best.	Yeroo hunda caalaa gaarii miti.
But you know your father.	Ati garuu abbaa kee beekta.
Sometimes in my own room.	Yeroo tokko tokko kutaa ofii koo keessatti.
It wasn’t our idea.	Yaada keenya hin turre.
But he should have left it there.	Garuu silaa achitti dhiisuu qaba ture.
But it shouldn't be like that.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
I am absolutely sure.	Ani guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa dha.
She doesn’t have to say anything.	Isheen homaa dubbachuu hin qabdu.
Everything else, he’s doing great.	Waan biraa hunda, waan guddaa hojjechaa jira.
As it is now.	Akkuma amma jiru.
One of them he knows.	Isaan keessaa tokko inni beeku.
We met in a bar.	Mana dhugaatii tokko keessatti wal argine.
He told me where to go.	Eessa akkan deemu natti hime.
It’s my passion.	Fedhii kooti.
There was nothing you could do.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
He just got it.	Inni amma argate.
Very nice guy.	Gurbaa baayyee namatti tola.
You don’t want to see that though.	Ati garuu sana arguu hin barbaaddu.
He looked into her eyes again.	Ammas ija ishee ilaale.
I wanted to ask your opinion.	Yaada keessan gaafachuu barbaade.
You need a new pair of shoes.	Kophee haaraa si barbaachisa.
Where were you.	Eessa turte.
I couldn’t find one.	Tokko argachuu hin dandeenye.
You have to come on overnight.	Halkan tokko irra dhufuu qabda.
That was good and bad.	Sun gaarii fi hamaa ture.
It’s really long.	Dhuguma dheeraa dha.
There were plenty of opportunities.	Carraan baay'ee ture.
But it’s not that simple.	Garuu akkas salphaa miti.
It’s just the one you’re working on.	Kan ati irratti hojjechaa jirtu qofa.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Completely, completely wrong.	Guutummaatti, guutummaatti dogoggora.
But it is not necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa miti.
She was very special.	Baayyee adda turte.
This should be correct.	Kun sirrii ta’uu qaba.
You should have told me.	Silaa naaf himuu qabda turte.
But now it was nothing.	Amma garuu homaa hin turre.
You’re not that great yet.	Ati ammallee hangas guddaa miti.
I don’t think you know me.	Ati na beektu natti hin fakkaatu.
That did nothing for me.	Sun homaa naaf hin goone.
I don’t know the answer.	Deebii isaa hin beeku.
If it is.	Yoo ta'e.
We are looking at it.	Irra ilaalaa jirra.
Nothing seemed right.	Wanti sirrii fakkaatu hin turre.
It’s a great one.	Guddaa dha.
You're right about that.	Waa'ee kanaa sirrii dha.
That was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture.
Probably both in this case.	Tarii haala kana keessatti lamaan isaaniiyyuu.
You are one of them.	Ati isaan keessaa tokko.
I don't know this.	Ani kana hin beeku.
It sounded a lot easier.	Sagalee isaatiin baayyee salphaa ta'e.
I don’t know, of course.	Hin beeku, beekamaadha.
I was a boy.	Ani gurbaa ture.
That sounds pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
It’s better not to.	Osoo hin taane wayya.
There are just more of them.	Isaan kana caalaa qofa jiru.
That was never his job.	Hojiin isaa sun gonkumaa hin turre.
I know you have to do it.	Akka ati gochuu qabdu nan beeka.
Things were not like that in real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti wanti akkas hin turre.
You’re in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirta.
She was looking at her.	Isheen ishee ilaalaa turte.
Wait for these people later.	Namoota kana booda eegaa.
There is no one there.	Namni achi hin jiru.
She was right about a lot of things.	Waa'ee waan baay'ee sirrii turte.
I hope it works out well.	Akka gaariitti akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
It makes one thing clear.	Waan tokko ifa godha.
A very special place.	Bakka baayyee adda ta'e.
That's how he was.	Akkas ture inni.
Very good condition.	Haala baayyee gaarii dha.
I wasn't sure what it was.	Maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
In real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti.
This was not a school.	Kun mana barumsaa hin turre.
Much of this and no more.	Kana baay'ee fi kana caalaa hin jiru.
A lot of people would come.	Namoonni baay'een ni dhufu turan.
He loves to do that.	Inni akkas gochuu ni jaallata.
This is my feeling.	Kun miira kooti.
I thought you were more than you seemed.	Ati waan ati fakkaattu caalaa natti fakkaate.
I am extremely sorry with you.	Si waliin garmalee dhiifama.
Not at work, not at home.	Hojii irratti miti, mana keessatti miti.
As you can imagine, that was a mistake.	Akkuma yaaddu, sun dogoggora ture.
Now he asked her this.	Amma kana ishee gaafate.
Sometimes more often than home during the week.	Yeroo tokko tokko torban keessatti mana caalaa yeroo baay’ee.
He wasn’t like that.	Inni akkas hin turre.
Look at what he has.	Waan inni qabu ilaalaa.
He had wanted to go so much.	Inni baay'ee deemuu barbaade ture.
If it ever happens.	Yoom iyyuu yoo ta'e.
He wanted everything in there.	Waan achi keessa jiru hunda barbaada ture.
Maybe it will happen again.	Tarii ammas ta'uu danda'a.
I really want this.	Kana baay'een barbaada.
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
Now his job is good.	Amma hojii isaa gaarii dha.
Now he has something else to think about.	Amma waan biraa itti yaadu qaba.
This works very well.	Kun baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
He didn't tell anyone what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru namatti hin himne.
You have to go.	Deemu qabda.
I think he's obvious.	Inni ifa natti fakkaata.
Not that night.	Halkan sana miti.
She said she could no longer work here.	Kana booda asitti hojjechuu hin dandeessu jette.
There is no one to help me.	Namni na gargaaru hin jiru.
She is always willing to help people.	Yeroo hundumaa namoota gargaaruuf fedhii qabdi.
In those days it didn’t matter just a little bit.	Bara sanatti xiqqoo qofa osoo hin taane dhimma hin qabu ture.
But they will soon be.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti ni ta'u.
We did what we wanted.	Waan barbaanne hojjenne.
It's too long,' he said.	Baay'ee dheeraa dha,' jedhe.
This can be a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta’uu danda’a.
I can't be without you.	Si malee ta'uu hin danda'u.
He wanted me not to go.	Inni akkan hin deemne barbaade.
You guys really have no idea.	Isin dhuguma yaada hin qabdu.
It couldn’t have mattered much.	Silaa baay’ee barbaachisaa ta’uu hin danda’u ture.
But not all of them.	Hundi isaanii garuu miti.
They are definitely not mine.	Isaan kan koo akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
It came out for you.	Siif ba'e.
You need that today.	Har'a sana si barbaachisa.
Which is not the case.	Kan hin taane.
Not exactly easy.	Sirriitti salphaa miti.
I can't stay here.	As turuu hin danda'u.
Something happened, it happened, something happened.	Waan tokko ta'e, ta'e, waan tokko ta'e.
I know you are.	Ati akka taate nan beeka.
He’s not sure.	Inni mirkanaa’aa miti.
Now I have a job.	Amma hojiin qaba.
That’s who we are.	Nuti eenyu akka taane kanuma.
He is here now.	Amma as jira.
I really don't understand why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle.
I know it.	Ani beeka.
That must be something, he told himself.	Sun waan tokko ta'uu qaba jedhee ofitti hime.
It could work but it shouldn't.	Hojjechuu danda'a garuu hojjechuu hin qabu.
He wanted to play.	Taphachuu barbaade.
It was all too much for him.	Hundi isaa garmalee isaaf ta'e.
This can be a problem.	Kun rakkoo ta’uu danda’a.
No one person is exactly the same as another.	Namni tokkollee sirriitti kan biraa wajjin wal fakkaatu hin jiru.
He doesn’t do anything to us.	Inni homaa nutti hin godhu.
It is not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa miti.
That's how it happened.	Akkasitti ta'e.
Mostly her though.	Irra caalaa ishee garuu.
That sounds good.	Sun gaarii fakkaata.
Now we have to go back.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu qabna.
He certainly doesn’t know.	Inni akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
One, she didn’t see me.	Tokko, isheen na hin argine.
This just can't be right.	Kun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
It was long before it came to me.	Naaf dhufuu isaa dura yeroo dheeraa ture.
I’m not doing this with you.	Ani kana si waliin hin godhu.
I know exactly what happened.	Waan ta'e sirriitti beeka.
That should be easy.	Sun salphaa ta’uu qaba.
Really, there’s nothing like her.	Dhuguma, wanti akka ishee hin jiru.
It was the door.	Balbala ture.
I thought it was.	Natti fakkaate.
But I knew my mother.	Haadha koo garuu nan beeka ture.
They need it.	Isaan barbaachisa.
Just a few weeks later.	Torban muraasa qofa booda.
I've been waiting for you.	Si eegaa tureera.
If it was that easy, I would already be here.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee silaa duraan as jira ture.
Things looked right, but they weren’t right.	Wanti sirrii fakkaata ture, garuu sirrii hin turre.
I can't tell.	Himuu hin danda'u.
Perhaps it was my problem.	Tarii rakkoo koo taʼuu dandaʼa.
She never knew what it was.	Maal akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beektu turte.
I don't want to know anything.	Waan tokko beekuu hin barbaadu.
The road and the road.	Karaa fi karaa.
After a moment he realized who it was.	Yeroo muraasa booda eenyu akka ta'e hubate.
I should never have told him.	Silaa gonkumaa itti himuu hin qabu ture.
But it is not inevitable.	Garuu waan hin oolle miti.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
This morning has been really easy.	Ganama kana dhuguma salphaa ta'ee jira.
He is inside me.	Inni keessa koo jira.
And yet, it’s there.	Ammas ta’ee, ni jira.
Now look at him.	Amma isa ilaalaa.
Someone who knows a little bit about you people.	Nama waa'ee keessan xiqqoo beeku namoota.
It’s not clear, so it can’t be dated.	Ifa miti, kanaaf guyyaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
He looked worse than he thought.	Inni waan yaade caalaa hamaa fakkaata ture.
We really should.	Dhuguma nuti gochuu qabna.
It worked, but not for long.	Hojjete, garuu yeroo dheeraaf miti.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
That’s your job right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana hojiin kee kanuma.
I mean, to a great extent.	Hamma guddaa jechuu kooti.
She was so much more than that.	Isheen baay'ee kana caalaa turte.
Then, we realized that really wasn’t necessary.	Sana booda, dhuguma sun akka hin barbaachifne hubanne.
Everyone already knows you should.	Namni hundi akka ati gochuu qabdu duruu beeka.
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
He had nothing more to say.	Kana booda waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
It took you weeks.	Torban hedduu sitti fudhate.
I didn’t think so.	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu ture.
I wasn’t any good.	Ani gaarii tokkollee hin turre.
This one is probably.	Inni kun tarii.
Maybe that's why.	Tarii kanaaf ta'uu danda'a.
It would have worked.	Silaa ni hojjeta ture.
They are making fun of my case.	Dhimma koo irratti qoosaa jiru.
Still wait, feel.	Ammas eegaa, miira.
He didn’t have it now, but he did sooner.	Amma hin qabu ture, garuu dafee qaba ture.
It was a dog.	Saree ture.
They think only of themselves.	Of qofa yaadu.
She didn't need one.	Tokko ishee hin barbaachifne.
Only one person did this.	Kana kan godhe nama tokko qofa.
It should absolutely do so.	Guutummaatti akkas gochuu qaba.
But that wasn’t the answer.	Garuu sun deebii hin turre.
We are all clear.	Hundi keenya ifaadha.
Even this past year.	Bara darbe kana illee.
You know why you are here.	Maaliif akka as jirtu ni beekta.
You don’t do it.	Hin gootu.
A lot of people work long hours here.	Namoonni baay'een asitti sa'aatii dheeraa hojjetu.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
Not one little bit.	Xiqqoo tokkollee miti.
I know why you are here.	Maaliif akka as jirtu nan beeka.
I don't think about it.	Ani itti hin yaadu.
But I don’t have time right now.	Garuu yeroo ammaa kana yeroo hin qabu.
I didn’t think there was.	Ani waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu ture.
There was no one to help me.	Namni na gargaaru hin turre.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
It happened there.	Achitti ta'e.
Why can’t you just leave him alone?	Maaliif qofa isa dhiisuu hin dandeessu?
A new language.	Afaan haaraa.
It’s not a mistake.	Dogoggora miti.
But that’s not a new idea.	Garuu sun yaada haaraa miti.
I was in it.	Ani keessa ture.
I really can't.	Dhuguma hin danda'u.
I shouldn’t have had it.	Ani qabaachuu hin qabu ture.
I don't have to talk about much.	Waa'ee baay'ee dubbachuu hin qabu.
She is a good girl.	Intala gaarii dha.
But there was no sound.	Garuu sagalee hin turre.
Something about her though.	Waa'ee ishee waan tokko garuu.
You're here, that's what matters.	Ati as jirta, wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma.
She doesn’t like work.	Hojii hin jaallattu.
I thought we had a chance.	Carraa qabna jedheen yaade.
Still maybe it happens.	Ammas tarii ta'uu danda'a.
Not even with the one.	Kan waliin illee miti.
I hope that it is.	Ani akka ta'e abdiin qaba.
This language is broad and wide.	Afaan kun bal’aa fi bal’aa dha.
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
Look at that moment.	Yeroo sana ilaalaa.
One year was like another.	Waggaa tokko akka waggaa biraa ture.
He needed those eyes.	Ija sana isa barbaachisa ture.
he says.	jedha.
What is this? 	Kun maali?
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
She was in a good mood.	Miira gaarii keessa turte.
That just seemed wrong.	Sun dogoggora qofa fakkaata ture.
He spoke but I never knew.	Dubbate garuu gonkumaa hin beeku.
She was herself.	Isheen ofii ishee turte.
He was too much of everything.	Inni waan hundumaa garmalee ture.
No one had ever done this before.	Kanaan dura namni kana godhe hin beeku.
Now that doesn’t matter.	Amma sun homaa hin qabu.
We are here to help.	Gargaaruuf as jirra.
That was her destination today.	Har'a bakka isheen deemtu sana ture.
I don't know how but he was right.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku garuu inni sirrii ture.
He took my little girl.	Intala koo xiqqoo fudhate.
She isn’t like that.	Isheen akkas miti.
It's not going to be obvious.	Ifa ta'uuf hin deemu.
I didn’t want you to know.	Akka ati beektu hin barbaanne.
He has a homework assignment.	Hojii manaa qaba.
This would be the only week he would be there.	Kun torban inni achi jiru qofa ta'a ture.
It was a really great performance.	Dhuguma ga'umsa guddaa ture.
There is nothing in it for him.	Isaaf homaa keessa hin jiru.
Not all is good.	Hundi gaarii miti.
We can't talk about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu hin dandeenyu.
It’s not dangerous.	Balaa hin qabu.
I wasn’t hers.	Ani kan ishee hin turre.
It was only a matter of time before people did.	Namoonni akkas gochuu isaanii dura dhimma yeroo qofa ture.
I didn’t know whether to believe her.	Ishee amanuu fi dhiisuu hin beeku ture.
He had to have her.	Ishee qabaachuu qaba ture.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Wanti hundi waan gaarii deemu fakkaata ture.
Except for nothing.	Homaa hin qabne malee.
It was a great interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii guddaa ture.
It was a great room.	Kutaa guddaa ture.
They love this food.	Nyaata kana ni jaallatu.
I can't do anything about this.	Kana irratti homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
It is extremely dangerous.	Balaa garmalee qaba.
He told me a lot about himself.	Waa'ee ofii isaa waan baay'ee natti hime.
That would be fine for the new guy.	Gurbaa haaraa kanaaf sun gaarii ta'a.
A good man.	Nama gaarii.
Just after three.	Sadii booda qofa.
He was no longer in her room.	Kana booda kutaa ishee keessa hin turre.
It was up there.	Achi ol ture.
I think it’s his mistake.	Dogoggora isaa natti fakkaata.
But it’s nice.	Garuu namatti tola.
Not that anyone asked for my opinion.	Namni yaada koo gaafate jechuu miti.
That’s my guy.	Sun gurbaa kooti.
There is no one.	Namni hin jiru.
You know they were wrong.	Dogoggora turan beekta.
You have the most important job.	Hojii hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e qabda.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
What we need, not food.	Kan nu barbaachisu, nyaata osoo hin taane.
They were not good people.	Namoota gaarii hin turre.
This was a lot of money.	Kun maallaqa guddaa ture.
It’s the best we have.	Waan qabnu hunda caalaa gaarii dha.
I don't want to see anyone.	Nama arguu hin barbaadu.
I'm sure it will be with you soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti akka si waliin ta'u mirkanaa'adha.
It’s not a bad thing.	Waan hamaa miti.
One and two.	Tokko fi lama.
There was nothing happening.	Wanti ta'aa jiru hin turre.
He was often in good shape in adversity.	Yeroo baayyee rakkoo keessatti haala gaarii irra ture.
They only need three things.	Waan sadii qofa isaan barbaachisa.
Who really knows.	Dhuguma eenyutu beeka.
He looked pleased with himself, boy.	Ofitti gammade fakkaata ture, gurbaa.
I can't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin danda'u.
Not that they ever will.	Yoomiyyuu ni ta'u jechuu miti.
It’s still like that.	Ammallee akkas jira.
This was him.	Kun isa ture.
This is not the case.	Kun akkas miti.
Everything has been fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee jira.
It was a disaster at the time.	Yeroo sanatti balaa guddaa ture.
He is not alone.	Kophaa isaa miti.
So it must be me.	Kanaaf ana ta'uu qaba.
I'm sure that's not a problem.	Sun rakkoo akka hin taane mirkanaa'adha.
It was a good one.	Gaarii ture.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I didn’t know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku ture.
My situation.	Haala koo.
It was a bad time.	Yeroon sun hamaa ture.
You’re doing a good job with them.	Isaan waliin hojii gaarii hojjechaa jirta.
he asked his mother.	jedhee haadha isaa gaafate.
One little thing though.	Waan xiqqoo tokko garuu.
It was just what we needed.	Waan nu barbaachisu qofa ture.
There is a reason inside.	Keessatti sababni jira.
I couldn’t find anything.	Homaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I didn't see her.	Ishee hin argine.
I can't do it now.	Amma gochuu hin danda'u.
No matter what now, the two still have a lot to offer.	Amma waan hin taane, lamaan isaanii ammallee waan baay'ee qabu.
Everybody says that all the time.	Yeroo hunda namni hundi akkas jedha.
Doing the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechuu.
He doesn't love anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin jaallatu.
You can't stay.	Turuu hin dandeessu.
She watched him for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf isa ilaalaa turte.
Then everything should work.	Sana booda wanti hundi hojjechuu qaba.
There's just too much going on in my life right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana jireenya koo keessatti waan baay'ee ta'aa jiru qofa.
She wasn't going to be a good mother.	Haadha gaarii ta'uuf hin turre.
He was an important man.	Nama barbaachisaa ture.
We have to do something.	Waan hojjechuu qabna.
You were evil.	Ati hamaa turte.
Now seems the right time to do so.	Amma yeroon akkas gochuuf sirrii fakkaata.
This didn't do anything.	Kun homaa hin goone.
He talked a bit about that.	Waa'ee sanaa xiqqoo dubbate.
Maybe you can help her?	Tarii ishee gargaaruu dandeessaa?
It was more than that.	Kana caalaa ture.
That was nothing.	Sun homaa hin turre.
I think it's pretty clear what's going on.	Maaltu akka jiru baayyee ifa natti fakkaata.
But you don’t have to.	Garuu dirqama hin qabdu.
She was not a human being.	Isheen nama hin turre.
It just seems wrong to let it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuun dogoggora qofa fakkaata.
Good good, this was good.	Gaarii gaarii, kun gaarii ture.
I'm working on it.	Isa irratti hojjechaa jira.
It was just too much.	Garmalee baay'ee qofa ture.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
We walked to the room together.	Waliin gara kutaa sanaa deemne.
If it's an accident, it's a lot.	Yoo balaa ta'e baay'ee ta'a.
I really mean that.	Dhuguma akkas jechuu kooti.
Which, of course, he wouldn't be.	Kan, beekamaadha, inni hin ta'u ture.
No joke, this is important.	Qoosaa miti, kun barbaachisaa dha.
I don't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
I usually like a job that is very different from mine.	Yeroo baayyee hojii kan koo irraa baayyee adda ta'e nan jaalladha.
Whether they really know is unclear.	Dhuguma beekuu fi dhiisuu isaanii ifa miti.
Sometimes, but not often.	Yeroo tokko tokko, garuu yeroo baay’ee miti.
But.	Garuu.
You know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e beekta.
Another reason is incorrect.	Sababni biraa sirrii miti.
He just seemed so different.	Inni akka malee adda ta'e qofa fakkaata ture.
He asked what makes life good.	Jireenya maaltu akka gaarii godhu gaafate.
You were here.	Ati as turte.
They weren’t mine.	Isaan kan koo hin turre.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Dhimma isaa tokkollee hin jiru.
Hopefully things will go smoothly this time.	Yeroo kana wanti sirriitti akka deemu abdii qabna.
They just do it.	Isaan qofa godhu.
I love that look.	Ija sana nan jaalladha.
It is simple and positive.	Salphaa fi kan gaarii dha.
Probably everything.	Tarii waan hundumaa.
But it was a disaster.	Garuu balaa ture.
We had each other even more than our issues.	Dhimma keenya caalaa illee wal qabna turre.
This is not mine.	Kun kan koo miti.
This was not my place.	Kun bakka koo hin turre.
Someone who asked for help too late.	Nama gargaarsa yeroon booda gaafate.
I should have known you better.	Silaa caalaatti si beekuu qaba ture.
There really isn’t.	Dhuguma hin jiru.
And I just walked out.	Anis qofa ba'e.
He’s dangerous.	Inni balaa qaba.
Not much but something.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane waan tokko.
Everything looked very different now.	Amma wanti hundi baayyee adda fakkaata ture.
There were a lot of us that day.	Guyyaa sana baay'ee turre.
It wasn't just about her.	Waa'ee ishee qofa hin turre.
The right question.	Gaaffii sirrii ta'e.
More often than we have.	Waan qabnu caalaa yeroo baay'ee.
It's probably really great.	Dhuguma guddaa ta'uu hin oolu.
It didn’t seem real.	Dhugaa hin fakkaatu ture.
It's like the old days.	Akka bara durii ta'a.
You need to find relevant work.	Hojii barbaachisaa argachuu qabda.
She was becoming a mother.	Isheen haadha ta'aa turte.
Do you have a hat?	Kophee qabduu?
Not here, not from her.	Asitti miti, ishee irraa miti.
Until then, always.	Hanga sanatti, yeroo hunda.
I don’t really know this area.	Dhuguma naannoo kana hin beeku.
In the other.	Kan biraa keessatti.
That would be too obvious.	Sun garmalee ifa ta’a.
He still had them.	Ammallee isaan qaba ture.
It’s not really a problem.	Dhuguma rakkoo miti.
He’d be something.	Inni waan tokko ta’a ture.
I know what he wants me to say.	Waan akkan jedhu barbaadu nan beeka.
I’m glad he’s here.	As jiraachuu isaatti gammadeera.
One thing, though.	Wanti tokko garuu.
That seems wrong.	Sun dogoggora fakkaata.
They were just opportunities.	Carraa qofa turan.
Very few now.	Amma baayyee muraasa.
That was three years ago.	Sun waggaa sadii dura ture.
I know now that none of this is true.	Kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa akka hin taane amma beeka.
Most people have a good sense of humor.	Namoonni baay’een miira qoosaa gaarii qabu.
She was sure of him.	Isheen isa irraa mirkanaa'aa turte.
It was bad enough.	Hamaa gahaa ture.
It can’t be.	Ta’uu hin danda’u.
I know what the problem is!	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e nan beeka!
Sometimes those two things don’t go together.	Yeroo tokko tokko wanti lamaan sun wal hin deemne.
But this night was different.	Halkan kun garuu adda ture.
Probably very few.	Tarii baayyee muraasa.
I love finding them.	Isaan argachuu nan jaalladha.
If not more than that.	Yoo kana caalaa hin taane.
He is no longer there.	Kana booda hin jiru.
I didn't think so.	Ani akkas hin yaadne.
That excludes a lot of people.	Sun namoota hedduu ala godha.
They needed another way.	Karaa biraa isaan barbaachisa ture.
This was a time, a long time ago now.	Kun yeroo ture, yeroo dheeraa dura amma.
It’s not a real job.	Hojii dhugaa miti.
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
Simple mistake.	Dogoggora salphaa.
There is nothing.	Homaa hin jiru.
It shouldn’t have gone that way.	Akkasitti deemuu hin qabu ture.
I didn’t know anyone.	Nama tokko hin beeku ture.
No one went there that day.	Guyyaa sana namni achi deeme hin jiru.
None of this is true.	Kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa miti.
Maybe we should go somewhere else.	Tarii bakka biraa deemuu qabna.
He seems more familiar.	Caalaatti nama beeku fakkaata.
Someone has to make it happen.	Namni tokko akka ta'u gochuu qaba.
But only for a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
There is a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni jira.
There was no one in the dressing room.	Kutaa uffata keessa namni tokkollee hin turre.
You don’t need it.	Si hin barbaachisu.
I like it.	Natti tola.
After all that work.	Hojii sana hunda booda.
They weren’t good enough.	Isaan gaarii hin turre.
You can do this for me.	Kana naaf gochuu dandeessa.
No one else seems to do it.	Namni biraa waan godhu hin fakkaatu.
I thought it was a good idea.	Yaada gaarii natti fakkaate.
We did what we had to do.	Waan gochuu qabnu hojjenne.
Even that, by itself, is not easy.	Sun illee, ofuma isaatiin, salphaa miti.
That’s how it went.	Akkasitti deeme.
Not sure if that's a good idea or not.	Sun yaada gaarii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I know more about it than you do.	Si caalaa waa'ee isaa beeka.
We are in here.	As keessa jirra.
He didn't say much today.	Har'a waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
That seems to have worked.	Sun waan hojjete fakkaata.
This was not entirely the case.	Kun garuu guutummaatti akkas hin turre.
In this case it doesn't.	Haala kana keessatti hin ta'u.
He had the same question.	Gaaffii wal fakkaatu qaba ture.
In a few moments.	Yeroo muraasa keessatti.
Seeing where she never was.	Bakka isheen gonkumaa hin taane arguu.
Time is all you have.	Yeroon jiru waan qabdu qofa.
Most people, however, are not so completely lucky.	Namoonni baay'een garuu akkas guutummaatti carraa hin qaban.
Because of this, it doesn't work.	Sababa kanaan hin hojjetu.
But that wasn’t good enough.	Garuu sun gaarii hin turre.
These are the ones that can be.	Isaan kun ta’uu danda’u.
It took a while.	Yeroo itti fudhate.
Like this guy.	Akka gurbaa kanaa.
Today, almost everything does something but does something.	Har’a wanti hundi jechuun ni danda’ama waan hojjetu malee waan tokko hojjeta.
A few people	Namoota muraasa
He was very lonely.	Baayyee kophaa isaa ture.
It seemed like nothing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan homaa hin taane fakkaata ture.
You know him much better than we do.	Ati nu caalaa baayʼee isa beekta.
There is someone out there who can help you.	Namni si gargaaruu danda'u ala jira.
I know it could be worse.	Kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka.
Too much, perhaps.	Garmalee, tarii.
Two completely different situations.	Haala guutummaatti adda ta’e lama.
This is not their job.	Kun hojii isaanii miti.
I was alone.	Ani kophaa koo ture.
I don't know if this is right though.	Kun sirrii ta'uu isaa garuu hin beeku.
We need to help him.	Isa gargaaruu qabna.
So I was very happy.	Kanaaf baay'een gammade.
It was yours.	Kan kee ture.
Which happened.	Kan ta'e.
He was a handful.	Inni harka muraasa ture.
They were already here.	Isaan duruu as turan.
This was worse than he thought.	Kun waan inni yaade caalaa hamaa ture.
Same comments.	Kanuma yaada kennuu.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
It was a very special place.	Bakka baayyee adda ta'e ture.
It is very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
You do, of course.	Ni qabda, beekamaadha.
But no one really is.	Garuu dhuguma namni hin jiru.
In one room.	Kutaa tokko keessatti.
That’s not entirely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
No one would think it possible but he was.	Namni ni danda'ama jedhee hin yaadu garuu inni ture.
You have friends who.	Hiriyyoota qabdu kan.
That’s all you need to know.	Kana qofa beekuu qabda.
I’m still working on it.	Ammas irratti hojjechaa jira.
He works for me.	Inni naaf hojjeta.
I don't have a picture of him.	Suuraa isaa hin qabu.
Me above all else.	Ana hunda caalaa.
A real bad feeling.	Miira hamaa dhugaa.
He didn’t know himself.	Of hin beeku ture.
That’s not our job.	Sun hojii keenya miti.
I used to like it.	Duraan natti tola ture.
He wasn’t a bad guy, really.	Inni nama hamaa hin turre, dhuguma.
But she didn’t need to.	Garuu isheen hin barbaachifne.
I know we can do it.	Akka gochuu dandeenyu nan beeka.
They often did.	Yeroo baayʼee ni godhu turan.
That's my bad.	Sun hamaa kooti.
There was nothing of that.	Sana keessaa homaa hin turre.
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
That worked out.	Sun hojjete.
This must be the year.	Kun bara ta'uu qaba.
It is certainly not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
This is my issue.	Kun dhimma kooti.
But maybe that's more my problem than yours.	Garuu tarii kan kee caalaa sun rakkoo koo ta'uu danda'a.
And now I never have.	Ammas gonkumaa hin qabu.
She was not interested in him.	Isheen isaaf fedhii hin qabdu turte.
Everything here seemed larger than life.	Wanti as jiru hundi jireenya caalaa guddaa fakkaata ture.
Sorry, but there you have it.	Dhiifama garuu achitti qabda.
Of course, this was not true.	Kun dhugaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
His work began.	Hojiin isaa jalqabe.
Not everyone knows every language.	Namni hundi afaan hunda hin beeku.
I love our house.	Mana keenya nan jaalladha.
But I tried to do a lot of things quickly.	Garuu waan baay'ee dafee hojjechuuf yaale.
It should be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu qaba.
Nothing is new anymore.	Kana booda wanti haaraa ta'e hin jiru.
Three people.	Namoota sadii.
But this never happened.	Garuu kun tasumaa hin taane.
We have a life.	Jireenya qabna.
That's not the case right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana akkas hin ta'u.
I just looked at it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa ilaale.
No one can help you.	Namni si gargaaruu danda'u hin jiru.
It seems too much, they have.	Garmalee fakkaata, waan qaban.
He's the moo.	Inni moo.
It's still not right.	Ammas sirrii miti.
It seems pretty simple.	Baayyee salphaa fakkaata.
I probably didn't want to know.	Ani beekuu hin barbaanne ta'a.
Never have much more to say.	Gonkumaa kana caalaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu hin qabu.
But he is wrong.	Garuu dogoggora qaba.
It was much more important than that.	Kana caalaa waan baayʼee barbaachisaa taʼe ture.
It won't be mine.	Kan koo hin ta'u.
Too much, even.	Garmalee, illee.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
You know this, you know.	Kana beektaa.
He knew exactly where everyone was.	Bakka namni hundi jiru sirriitti beeka ture.
I’ve never been here.	Ani as turee hin beeku.
I really don’t know how to say it.	Dhuguma akkamitti akkan jedhu hin beeku.
He had said his part.	Inni kutaa isaa jedhee ture.
Many people are not as lucky.	Namoonni baay'een akka carraa hin qaban.
Only two of them.	Lama qofa.
I know, but .	Ani beeka, garuu .
There was no one there.	Namni achi hin turre.
It 's all	Hundi isaa .
I so don’t have enough time right now.	Ani akkas yeroo ammaa yeroo gahaa hin qabu.
They are exactly the same.	Sirriitti wal fakkaatu.
But it was something.	Garuu waan tokko ture.
But none of these things are true.	Garuu wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa miti.
But not with her.	Garuu ishee waliin miti.
Maybe it will say something.	Tarii waan tokko jechuu danda'a.
They are good children.	Ijoollee gaarii dha.
I know her.	Ishee beeka.
Just a little longer.	Xiqqoo dheeraa qofa.
That’s not me anymore.	Kana booda sun ana miti.
Again, one is not too many.	Ammas tokko baay'ee miti.
School .	Mana Barumsaa .
I don’t think we could ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu waan dandeenyu natti hin fakkaatu.
It's never happened before.	Kanaan dura ta'ee hin beeku.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
I knew something was wrong.	Waan tokko akka dogoggora ta'e nan beeka ture.
This time it's very different.	Yeroo kana baayyee adda ta'ee jira.
I know, but that’s not important now.	Ani nan beeka, garuu amma sun barbaachisaa miti.
We need to do this.	Kana gochuu qabna.
I think a lot of people were.	Namoonni baay'een akka turan natti fakkaata.
One year was enough.	Waggaa tokko gahaa ture.
We don’t need that.	Sana nu hin barbaachisu.
He was just here.	Inni as qofa ture.
Of course there was nothing there.	Achitti wanti tokkollee akka hin turre beekamaadha.
That's very nice of you.	Sun baay'ee sitti tola.
That doesn't help us much.	Sun baay'ee nu hin gargaaru.
None of this is true.	Kun tokkollee dhugaa miti.
He had a few friends.	Hiriyyoota muraasa qaba ture.
I don’t need that.	Sana na hin barbaachisu.
You'll never know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yoomiyyuu hin beektu.
But there is.	Garuu jira.
It’s not that bad.	Akkas hamaa miti.
It was just my luck.	Carraa koo qofa ture.
I am very good at it.	Ani baayyee itti ga'umsa qaba.
I can be there for you.	Ani siif ta'uu nan danda'a.
I would go with you.	Si waliin deema ture.
I know you.	Si beeka.
Today seems like one of those times.	Har'a yeroo sana keessaa tokko fakkaata.
He certainly isn’t the only one.	Inni qofa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It doesn't do anything.	Waan tokko hin hojjetu.
It’s not just him.	Isa qofa miti.
So far, that is.	Hanga ammaatti jechuun.
It was a very bad situation.	Haala baayyee hamaa ture.
It’s on the house for you.	Siif mana irra jira.
The work of the.	Kan hojii.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
That is, the.	Kana jechuun.
By himself.	Ofii isaatiin.
But you know what happened.	Garuu waan ta'e ni beekta.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
You’re a nice guy.	Ati namatti tola.
Like we did this morning.	Akkuma ganama kana goone.
It’s not a problem.	Rakkoo miti.
Maybe you're wrong.	Tarii dogoggora ta'uu dandeessa.
One is not too good.	Tokko garmalee gaarii miti.
I think it will come in time.	Yeroo booda waan dhufu natti fakkaata.
I don't know if it's such a good idea.	Yaada akkasii gaarii ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
Clearly, this was not easy.	Kun salphaa akka hin turre ifaadha.
What is happening is emotional.	Wanti ta'aa jiru miira irratti.
But, it was like that.	Garuu, akkas ture.
He wanted nothing more.	Kana caalaa wanti inni barbaadu hin turre.
You were a mother.	Ati haadha turte.
It's good together.	Waliin gaarii dha.
This was often not true.	Yeroo baayʼee kun dhugaa hin turre.
I really don't have it.	Dhuguma hin qabu.
Time for me to go.	Yeroon ani itti deemu.
He is there alone.	Inni kophaa isaa achi jira.
All they have is money.	Wanti isaan qaban maallaqa qofa.
This is the person you want.	Nama ati barbaaddu kana.
The problem still exists.	Rakkoon ammas jira.
What do you like to eat?	Maal nyaachuu jaallattu?
Tomorrow might be a possibility, but then again maybe not.	Boru carraa ta'uu danda'a, garuu sana booda ammas tarii hin ta'u.
You have to help us to help you.	Akka si gargaaruuf nu gargaaruu qabda.
It will be easier to do this a couple of times.	Kana yeroo lama lama gochuun salphaa ta'a.
She’s been up there for a year now.	Amma waggaa tokko achi ol turte.
But this is not the time.	Garuu yeroon kun yeroon isaa miti.
But it was clear enough.	Garuu ifa gahaa ture.
What happened.	Maal ta'e.
It was all completely different from my old life.	Hundi isaa jireenya koo isa durii irraa guutummaatti adda ture.
Perhaps now is the time.	Tarii yeroon isaa amma taʼuu dandaʼa.
He said why not.	Maaliif hin taane jedhe.
But that was just me.	Garuu sun ana qofa ture.
He was just one of those guys.	Inni gurbaa sana keessaa tokko qofa ture.
But it's not happening.	Garuu ta'aa hin jiru.
But he quickly realized that it couldn't be anything like that.	Garuu waan akkasii ta'uu akka hin dandeenye dafee hubate.
You are in the right place.	Bakka sirrii ta'e keessa jirta.
So this is what the problem looks like.	Kanaaf rakkoon jiru kana fakkaata.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
I have a lot of it.	Baay'een qaba.
There was not much else we could do.	Wanti biraa baayʼee gochuu dandeenyu hin turre.
I knew what he really meant.	Dhuguma maal jechuu akka barbaade nan beeka ture.
Just thought you should know.	Beekuu qabda jedhee qofa yaade.
No shoes, again.	Kophee hin qabu, ammas.
I don't know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
Moreover.	Caalaatti.
He is still inside them.	Inni ammallee keessa isaanii jira.
Where was it supposed to be.	Eessa ta'uu qaba ture.
In this case, however, that is incorrect.	Haala kana keessatti garuu sun sirrii miti.
For a moment he wondered what he should do.	Yeroo muraasaaf maal gochuu akka qabu yaade.
He can't do that.	Inni akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
Please try it.	Mee yaalaa.
I can still see that little girl.	Intala xiqqoo sana ammallee arguu nan danda'a.
Now they have money.	Amma maallaqa qaban.
He had a big mouth.	Afaan guddaa qaba ture.
It was nothing before.	Kana dura homaa hin turre.
He wanted to see it again.	Ammas arguu barbaade.
You don’t have all the answers.	Deebii hunda hin qabdu.
But he wasn’t here.	Garuu inni as hin turre.
Maybe a lot more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa baay'ee ta'uu danda'a.
It was pretty clear he had no idea what to do.	Maal akka godhu yaada akka hin qabne baay'ee ifa ture.
As he goes along.	Akkuma inni deemu.
I don't know what he's doing.	Waan hojjetu hin beeku.
He says he is looking for a job.	Hojii barbaadaa jira jedha.
I couldn't say anything.	Homaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
He had something to tell me.	Waan natti himu qaba ture.
That wasn't right, either.	Sun sirrii hin turre, tokkollee.
I can't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin danda'u.
When we were.	Yeroo nu turre.
So it's just me.	Kanaaf ana qofa.
I had a gleam in my eye.	Ija koo keessaa ifa qaba ture.
He must see it.	Arguu qaba.
He is a good dog.	Inni saree gaarii dha.
I'm sure you have many questions.	Gaaffii hedduu akka qabdu mirkanaa'adha.
Now we have another problem.	Amma rakkoo biraa qabna.
I said it was mine.	Kan kooti jedheen.
But he still needs help.	Garuu ammallee gargaarsa barbaada.
See how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu ilaalaa.
Not 'us' not 'them'.	'Nu' miti 'isaan' miti.
I know what my problem is.	Rakkoon koo maal akka ta'e nan beeka.
Perhaps that is their problem.	Tarii rakkoon isaanii kanuma taʼuu dandaʼa.
You have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
What if what if that happens.	Maal yoo ta'e maal yoo akkas ta'e.
He never seems to notice.	Inni gonkumaa waan hubate hin fakkaatu.
Now, something else.	Amma, waan biraa.
Everything was the same, but everything was different.	Wanti hundi tokko ture, garuu wanti hundi adda ture.
It would have worked.	Silaa ni hojjeta ture.
In some areas that would be funny.	Naannoo tokko tokko keessatti sun qoosaa ta'a.
It was a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa ture.
Then it may very well be.	Sana booda baay'ee gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
Now there is nothing here for me.	Amma wanti as jiru naaf hin jiru.
What he knows.	Waan inni beeku.
It almost came from nothing.	Homaa irraa dhufe jechuun ni danda'ama.
We need to find this truth.	Dhugaa kana argachuu qabna.
I was good to you.	Ani siif gaarii ture.
It’s devouring.	Nama nyaata.
Just stay indoors.	Mana keessa turuu qofa.
Clearly, that should not be the case.	Akkas taʼuu akka hin qabne ifaadha.
More probably his wife's.	Caalaatti kan haadha manaa isaa ta'uu hin oolu.
They need new shoes.	Kophee haaraa isaan barbaachisa.
It may be true.	Dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
The bigger the better.	Hamma guddaa ta'e gaarii dha.
I think that’s great.	Sun waan guddaa natti fakkaata.
She was always there for him.	Yeroo hunda isheen isa bira turte.
That seems like a possible place.	Sun bakka ta'uu danda'u fakkaata.
If not, tell me.	Yoo hin taane natti himi.
But we hadn’t seen him.	Garuu isa hin argine turre.
But that’s how it goes.	Garuu akkasitti deema.
I mean, I can tell you more than the truth.	Dhugaa jiru caalaa sitti himuu danda'a jechuu kooti.
It wasn’t too obvious.	Garmalee ifa hin turre.
They’re their age, those two.	Isaan umuriin isaanii, lamaan sun.
It's just a book.	Kitaaba qofa.
Why didn’t you go now? 	Maaliif amma hin deemne?
. . . .	.
If only things had been a little different.	Osoo wanti xiqqoo adda ta'ee ture.
And you can never say never again.	Ammas gonkumaa gonkumaa jechuu hin dandeessu.
He thought of another time, another place.	Yeroo biraa, bakka biraa itti yaade.
I'm happy for you.	Siif gammadeera.
You know, he was right.	Beektaa, inni sirrii ture.
Not until now.	Hanga kana booda miti.
We cannot do more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
Now she had neither.	Amma lamaan isaaniiyyuu hin qabdu turte.
You can’t ask him.	Isa gaafachuu hin dandeessu.
Then it happened.	Sana booda ta'e.
Now I don't know what it is.	Amma maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
I haven’t been able to do that yet.	Hanga ammaatti akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
What happens later, happens.	Wanti booda ta'u, ni ta'a.
It's probably something you need to know.	Waan beekuu qabdu ta'uu hin oolu.
But it still doesn’t work.	Garuu ammallee hin hojjetu.
He didn’t want to see me anymore.	Kana booda na arguu hin barbaanne.
A very good feeling.	Miira baayyee gaarii ta'e.
So that’s what she does.	Kanaaf waan isheen gootu kanuma.
But it won't work tonight.	Garuu halkan kana hin hojjetu.
It seems to be more than ever.	Yeroo hundumaa caalaa waan ta'e fakkaata.
They were lucky.	Carraa qaban turan.
He knew he belonged there.	Kan achi ta'uu isaa ni beeka ture.
They are with me.	Isaan na waliin jiru.
They have more than enough food.	Nyaata gahaa ol qabu.
Which is important and which isn’t quite so.	Kan barbaachisaa fi kan akkas hin taane guutummaatti.
He had a lot to do.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu qaba ture.
You must stay with me.	Ati na bira turuu qabda.
Just not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti qofa.
Not exactly like that.	Sirrii akkas miti.
It's not like he can see me.	Akka inni na arguu danda'u miti.
He should have made it clear.	Silaa ifa gochuu qaba ture.
But probably many are unsure.	Garuu tarii baay'een isaanii mirkanaa'aa miti.
Together with together.	Waliin waliin.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
But we have no such issue here.	Garuu asitti dhimma akkasii hin qabnu.
She was tall.	Isheen dheeraa turte.
So much so.	Hanga kana.
I don’t even know their names.	Maqaa isaanii illee hin beeku.
I can tell you it matters.	Dhimma akka qabu sitti himuu nan danda'a.
We have plenty of time.	Yeroo hedduu qabna.
It takes a whole book to do that.	Kana gochuuf kitaaba guutuu barbaachisa.
It wasn’t during the day.	Guyyaa hin turre.
But they are reluctant to believe it.	Garuu amanuu irraa duubatti jedhu.
We were waiting.	Eegaa turre.
That says something.	Sun waan tokko jedha.
You can tell me later.	Booda natti himuu dandeessu.
They are still there.	Ammas achi jiru.
Most people should know this already.	Namoonni baay’een kana duruu beekuu qabu.
I really have no idea.	Dhuguma yaada hin qabu.
But that was for a while.	Garuu sun yeroo muraasaaf ture.
But it is not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti.
I will.	Ani nan.
We met on the road.	Karaa irratti wal argine.
You need shoes.	Kophee si barbaachisa.
For us.	Nuuf.
I don't think this happened.	Kun waan ta'e natti hin fakkaatu.
Sounds like.	Sagalee akka.
I just need to see her.	Ishee arguu qofa na barbaachisa.
Not now he is gone.	Amma miti inni hin jiru.
She always acted like this.	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti of goote.
Maybe we already are.	Tarii nuti duruu jirra ta'a.
I wanted much, much more.	Kana caalaa baayʼee baayʼee barbaade.
But this isn’t the worst part.	Garuu kun waan hunda caalaa hamaa miti.
But he has an issue.	Garuu dhimma tokko qaba.
I think they are pretty good.	Isaan baayyee gaarii natti fakkaata.
He's looking at me.	Na ilaalaa jira.
We are all good.	Hundi keenya gaarii dha.
One cannot say more than that.	Kana caalaa namni tokko dubbachuu hin danda’u.
You can't do anything to us.	Homaa nu gochuu hin dandeessu.
He knew his name.	Maqaa isaa ni beeka ture.
It was very important to me.	Naaf baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
I'm really sorry.	Dhuguma dhiifama.
But, that hasn’t happened yet.	Garuu, sun ammallee hin taane.
It was just my reality.	Dhugaa koo qofa ture.
So again.	Kanaaf ammas.
He doesn't really like me,' she said.	Inni dhuguma na hin jaallatu,' jette.
While she was going to.	Osoo isheen gara...
I think we need to know more about that.	Waa'ee sanaa caalaatti beekuu qabna jedheen yaada.
That’s how he saw me.	Akkasitti na arge.
Do you have any questions?	Gaaffii qabduu?
But they had it.	Garuu qaban turan.
He is looking for a job.	Hojii barbaadaa jira.
He would never have been human.	Silaa gonkumaa nama hin ta'u ture.
I wouldn't be here if that was possible.	Osoo sun ta'uu danda'a ta'ee as hin jiru ture.
Maybe it's more than that.	Tarii kanuma caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
But now he knew that wasn’t true.	Garuu amma sun dhugaa akka hin taane beeka ture.
But now everyone seemed to know.	Amma garuu namni hundi waan beeku fakkaata ture.
It's going to be ours.	Kan keenya ta'uuf deema.
He got that feeling.	Miira sana argate.
It was a very special time.	Yeroon sun yeroo baayʼee adda taʼe ture.
It was something new.	Waan haaraa ture.
Maybe a little bit of both.	Tarii xiqqoo lamaan isaanii keessaa ta'uu danda'a.
Now, it seemed about right.	Amma, waan sirrii ta'e fakkaata ture.
When was it?	Yoom ture?
But I don't know why.	Maaliif garuu hin beeku.
Just one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa.
He knew what it was.	Maal akka ta'e ni beeka ture.
Both times it worked without a problem.	Yeroo lamaan rakkoo tokko malee hojjete.
I have a few ideas.	Yaada muraasa qaba.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baayyee itti gammade.
I told him, it was okay.	Anis itti hime, homaa miti.
But it is not an easy task.	Garuu hojii salphaa miti.
She made it look easy.	Salphaa akka fakkaatu goote.
You can really see everything.	Dhuguma waan hundumaa arguu dandeessa.
You should have seen it!	Silaa arguu qabda turte!
But it wasn’t easy.	Garuu salphaa hin turre.
They work well together.	Akka gaariitti waliin hojjetu.
So new she was here, no one had seen that.	Kanaaf haaraa isheen as turte, namni sana arge hin turre.
No one could know.	Namni beekuu hin dandeenye.
You don’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akka gootu hin beektu.
I may still have one.	Ammallee tokko qabaachuu danda'a.
This isn’t me, obviously.	Kun ana miti, ifaadha.
I don't know.	Hin beeku.
The idea you are having.	Yaada ati qabaa jirtu.
It's really not very easy to say.	Dhuguma jechuun baayyee salphaa miti.
People love it.	Namoonni ni jaallatu.
I can't do that.	Sana gochuu hin danda'u.
No one wants it, everyone should have it.	Namni hin barbaadu, namni hundi qabaachuu qaba.
He just said he didn't want to.	Hin barbaadu qofa jedhe.
All in one.	Hundi tokko keessatti.
Maybe even a watch.	Tarii sa'aatii illee ta'uu danda'a.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Tarii wanti akkasii jiraachuu danda'a.
They were still looking for her.	Ammas ishee barbaadaa turan.
He wants one though.	Tokko barbaada garuu.
Much like his father.	Baayyee akkuma abbaa isaa.
Now I knew exactly where my mouth was.	Amma afaan koo eessa akka jiru sirriitti beeka ture.
This has been a lot of work.	Kun hojiin isaa baay’ee ta’ee jira.
He asked this question and asked this question.	Gaaffii kana gaafate gaaffii kana gaafate.
I shouldn’t have gone.	Silaa deemuu hin qabu ture.
She couldn’t be looking at him.	Isheen isa ilaalaa jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
Not his father.	Abbaa isaa miti.
Play.	Taphachuu.
When no one is around.	Yeroo namni naannoo hin jirre.
This is nothing.	Kun homaa miti.
You don’t have to do this now.	Amma kana gochuun dirqama miti.
He was the father of it all.	Inni abbaa waan kana hunda ture.
This way you know they’re real.	Haala kanaan dhugaa ta’uu isaanii ni beekta.
Tell him to do something.	Waan tokko akka hojjetu itti himi.
It had nothing that anyone here would want.	Waan namni as jiru barbaadu tokkollee hin qabu ture.
There were two others.	Lama kan biraa ture.
It is no longer clear.	Kana booda ifa miti.
Not us, not me.	Nu miti, ana miti.
It was a little bit.	Xiqqoo ture.
Something was wrong here.	Asitti wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
More often than not.	Yeroo baayyee caalaa.
I think it’s a good one.	Kan gaarii dha jedheen yaada.
I didn’t think it was a good idea.	Yaada gaarii natti hin fakkaatu ture.
That would be a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ta'a.
You should see it.	Arguu qabdu.
It didn't happen often.	Yeroo baay'ee hin ta'u ture.
Every day, just one.	Guyyaa hunda, tokko qofa.
They’re just people.	Isaan namoota qofa.
This is not easy to do.	Kun gochuun salphaa miti.
I know you know you want a piece of that.	Sana keessaa kutaa tokko akka barbaaddu akka beektu nan beeka.
He saw his surroundings.	Naannoo isaa arge.
His work is always the same.	Hojiin isaa yeroo hundumaa tokko.
This is no small thing.	Kun waan xiqqoo miti.
You can’t see over that.	Sana irra arguu hin dandeessu.
He didn't do any work himself.	Ofii hojii tokkollee hin hojjenne.
He really doesn't need much anymore.	Dhuguma kana booda baay'ee isa hin barbaachisu.
He told me that he did.	Akka godhe natti hime.
Right person, right time.	Nama sirrii, yeroo sirrii.
There, that’s better.	Achitti, sun wayya.
No problem.	Rakkoo hin qabu.
This is just like	Kana akkuma .
It will be clear again.	Ammas ni ifa.
I really love you.	Ani dhuguma si jaalladha.
We were right then.	Yeroo sanatti sirrii turre.
You know what was happening.	Waan ta'aa ture ni beekta.
Sorry it has to come to this.	Dhiifama gara kanaa dhufuu qaba.
You’re definitely not very good.	Ati baay’ee gaarii akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He really wasn't that bright.	Dhuguma inni hangas ifa hin turre.
Asking what happened.	Maal ta'e gaafachuu.
I just stared at her.	Anis ija keessa ishee ilaale qofa.
The good and the bad.	Waan gaarii fi waan hamaa.
I know it will be as it is.	Akkuma ta'e akka ta'u nan beeka.
We understood each other.	Wal hubanne.
I walked right into something.	Anis sirriitti waan tokko keessa deeme.
I can still play.	Ammallee taphachuu nan danda'a.
That sounds like a bad idea.	Sun yaada hamaa fakkaata.
Over time this worked well.	Yeroo booda kun akka gaariitti hojjete.
Something that never happened to you.	Waan gonkumaa siif hin taane.
It's not about me.	Waa'ee koo miti.
It seems so wrong.	Akkas dogoggora fakkaata.
He could have been right.	Inni sirrii ta’uu danda’a ture.
This was the case.	Kun akkas ture.
Everything has good times and bad times.	Wanti hundi yeroo gaarii fi yeroo hamaa qaba.
He looked at his hand.	Harka isaa ilaale.
That it may be.	Akka ta'uuf.
It gave me a great idea.	Yaada guddaa naaf kenne.
You can’t have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
You were there.	Ati achi turte.
That's nothing.	Sun homaa miti.
Another week ahead of us.	Torban biraa nu dura jira.
I didn’t want a job anymore.	Kana booda hojii hin barbaanne.
I loved my father.	Abbaa koo nan jaalladha ture.
This is two of the clock.	Kun sa'aatii keessaa lama.
Again, it doesn't.	Ammas, hin ta'u.
I know you know something.	Waan tokko akka beektu nan beeka.
I’m trying not to get involved.	Ani akkan keessa hin galle yaalaa jira.
I have no idea what it is.	Maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
He did us both a favor.	Lamaan keenyayyuu waan gaarii nuuf godhe.
Now think about it.	Amma mee yaadu.
So what are they.	Kanaaf maali isaanii.
Several.	Baay'ee.
It's your right place.	Bakka kee sirrii dha.
Now, it’s not so bad.	Amma, akkas hamaa miti.
I don't want to talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
I, too, was going.	Anis, deemaa ture.
Everything went really well.	Dhuguma wanti hundi sirriitti deeme.
I like this one the best.	Isa kana hunda caalaa natti tola.
I want my reputation and reputation.	Maqaa gaarii fi maqaa gaarii koo nan barbaada.
It's not exactly clear why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti ifa miti.
This was not my idea.	Kun yaada koo hin turre.
That should be more than enough.	Sun gahaa ol ta’uu qaba.
It is no longer yours.	Kana booda kan kee miti.
I knew something was coming.	Waan tokko akka dhufu nan beeka ture.
It must be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu qaba.
He did so on the quick.	Dafee irratti akkas godhe.
I didn't think so.	Ani hin yaadne.
It has a picture.	Suuraa qaba.
I just didn’t talk like that.	Akkasitti hin dubbanne qofa.
My career was only a matter of time.	Hojiin koo dhimma yeroo qofa ture.
This was their mistake.	Kun dogoggora isaanii ture.
I wasn’t looking at him.	Isa ilaalaa hin turre.
I really like this thing.	Waan kana baay'een jaalladha.
He wanted to be alone.	Kophaa ta'uu barbaade.
He had no room to do so.	Akkas gochuuf kutaa hin qabu ture.
Which is too long.	Kan garmalee dheeraa ta'e.
They may be back soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti deebi'uu danda'u.
People love this.	Namoonni kana ni jaallatu.
It was going within a month.	Ji'a tokko keessatti deemaa ture.
But he could have.	Garuu qabaachuu danda'a ture.
It was really nice though.	Dhuguma garuu baayyee namatti tola ture.
I've never been with them.	Isaan waliin ta'ee hin beeku.
We belonged, not inside.	Nuti kan turre, keessa osoo hin taane.
He was a duty.	Inni dirqama ture.
It seems too much of the real thing.	Garmalee waan dhugaa sanaa fakkaata.
It’s doing fine with me.	Ana waliin gaarii hojjechaa jira.
We don't have any.	Tokkollee hin qabnu.
But this time it was a must.	Yeroo kana garuu dirqama ture.
I thought it was good.	Gaarii natti fakkaate.
He couldn’t live his life.	Jireenya isaa jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
They know better.	Isaan caalaatti beeku.
Tell your parents that you love them.	Warra kee akka isaan jaallattu itti himi.
It was more about us than it was about you.	Waa'ee kee caalaa waa'ee keenya ture.
I am in the same situation.	Anis haala wal fakkaatu keessa jira.
I think everyone should know this.	Kana namni hundi beekuu qaba jedheen yaada.
I didn’t want to do that.	Kana gochuu hin barbaanne.
Now she was no longer alone.	Amma kana booda kophaa ishee hin turre.
Just then, .	Yeroo sanatti qofa, .
More than one dress.	Uffata tokko caalaa.
I don't want to be that person anymore.	Kana booda nama sana ta'uu hin barbaadu.
Apparently she didn't have much.	Waan baay'ee hin qabdu turte fakkaata.
We are not the same.	Nuti tokko miti.
She wasn't too happy about being late.	Isheen waa'ee yeroon booda dhufuu baay'ee gammade hin turre.
It was just me.	Ana qofa ture.
You know what this is.	Kun maal akka ta'e ni beektu.
I don't know what he did to you.	Maal akka si godhe hin beeku.
They want this.	Kana barbaadu.
Which was real enough.	Kan dhugaa gahaa ture.
I don't know anything about that.	Waa'ee sanaa homaa hin beeku.
It was more like we were in that moment.	Yeroo sana keessa akka turre caalaa ture.
Maybe most of the time.	Tarii yeroo baay'ee.
So, so long.	Kanaaf, hangas dheeraa.
I know you can do it.	Akka dandeessu nan beeka.
What he needs.	Waan isa barbaachisu.
So sorry, so sorry.	Kanaaf dhiifama, kanaaf dhiifama.
It was her forgiveness.	Dhiifama ishee turte.
You are very new.	Ati baayyee haaraa dha.
You are not real.	Ati dhugaa miti.
I hadn't thought much about it though.	Waa'ee kanaa garuu baay'ee hin yaadne ture.
She had no idea what she was going to do.	Waan gochuuf deemtu yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
I could have been with my daughter more.	Silaa kana caalaa intala koo wajjin taʼuu nan dandaʼa ture.
But only in this place.	Garuu bakka kana qofa.
Do you .	Ati .
I didn’t know that at the time.	Yeroo sanatti ani kana hin beeku ture.
And I did it for him.	Anis isaaf godhe.
Why do people look like their parents.	Namoonni maaliif warra isaanii fakkaatu.
These are people.	Isaan kun namoota.
I still have that problem.	Ammallee rakkoon sun qaba.
They were good people.	Isaan namoota gaarii turan.
I think it has a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa kan qabu natti fakkaata.
But I don't want him.	Ani garuu isa hin barbaadu.
These two are no exception.	Isaan lamaan kun kanaan ala miti.
But I am happy now.	Garuu amma gammadeera.
She was one of those people.	Namoota sana keessaa tokko turte.
He didn't have to go now.	Amma deemuun isa hin barbaachifne.
He was still on it.	Ammas irra ture.
Which is important and which isn’t quite so.	Kan barbaachisaa fi kan akkas hin taane guutummaatti.
But even this is important.	Garuu kun illee barbaachisaa dha.
Everything else was in place.	Wanti biraa jiru hundi bakka ture.
I mean her mother.	Haadha ishee jechuu kooti.
This is now very clear!.	Kun amma baayyee ifaadha!.
But he was thinking of something.	Garuu waan tokko yaada ture.
That was all very well.	Sun hundi baayyee gaarii ture.
Maybe you can see right through them.	Tarii karaa isaanii sirriitti arguu dandeessa ta'a.
I didn't understand what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin hubanne.
I could ask you the same question.	Gaaffii wal fakkaatu si gaafachuu nan danda'a ture.
All we have is a question.	Wanti nuti qabnu gaaffii qofa.
I have a job.	Hojiin qaba.
I don’t do that.	Akkas hin godhu.
But it's nothing too special.	Garuu waan baay'ee adda ta'e miti.
It really must be me.	Dhuguma natti ta'uu qaba.
Just after three.	Sadii booda qofa.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe a year from now.	Tarii boru, tarii waggaa tokko booda.
I never have it.	Ani gonkumaa hin qabu.
This is often not true.	Kun yeroo baay’ee dhugaa miti.
She doesn't want me.	Isheen na hin barbaaddu.
It seemed like a great deal.	Waan guddaa fakkaata ture.
But we still have a long way to go.	Garuu ammallee karaa dheeraa qabna.
I couldn’t believe it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf amanuu hin dandeenye.
I am one of those people.	Namoota sana keessaa tokko ana.
He wasn’t there, but he knew.	Inni achi hin turre, garuu ni beeka.
I can't say when.	Yoom jechuu hin danda'u.
So far, no such possibility exists.	Hanga ammaatti carraan akkasii hin jiru.
Maybe you can get more out of him.	Tarii kana caalaa isa irraa argachuu dandeessa ta'a.
You can make a lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa argachuu dandeessa.
I'm not involved.	Ani harka keessa hin jiru.
That’s one of the things.	Wantoota keessaa tokko kanuma.
It was always good for you.	Yeroo hundumaa siif gaarii ture.
No one could.	Namni tokkollee hin dandeenye.
But he said it wouldn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u jedhe.
This time the problem is different.	Yeroo kana rakkoon jiru adda.
It seemed to be true.	Dhugaa waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
I want to feel good about myself.	Ofitti miira gaarii qabaachuu nan barbaada.
This time it was like a different person.	Yeroo kana akka nama adda ta'ee ture.
We all have a past.	Hundi keenya waan darbe qabna.
Such a person would never be a dog person.	Namni akkasii gonkumaa nama saree hin ta'u ture.
It’s still mine.	Ammallee kan kooti.
I never wanted that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin barbaanne.
He realized she was looking at him.	Isheen isa ilaalaa akka jirtu hubate.
So you have to tell him.	Kanaaf itti himuu qabda.
Something is not right here.	Asitti wanti tokko sirrii miti.
But he knew, again, that this wasn’t true.	Garuu inni ni beeka ture, ammas, kun dhugaa akka hin taane.
I didn't know everything about her yet.	Waa'ee ishee hanga ammaatti waan hunda hin beeku ture.
It’s not for us.	Nuuf miti.
Totally unable to before.	Guutummaatti kanaan dura hin dandeenye.
He was in great trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa ture.
It's been a disaster.	Balaa ta'ee jira.
But he knew what would happen.	Garuu waan ta'u beeka ture.
There were three of them.	Isaan keessaa sadii turan.
It was his answer.	Deebii isaa ture.
We had nothing in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu hin qabnu turre.
It’s just the truth.	Dhugaa qofa.
Everyone seemed to think this was a good idea.	Namni hundi kun yaada gaarii waan itti fakkaatu fakkaata ture.
He looked like their father.	Abbaa isaanii fakkaata ture.
It was then that everything became clear to me.	Yeroo sana ture wanti hundi naaf ifa ta’e.
This thing?	Wanti kun?
I don’t know why he didn’t say it.	Maaliif akka hin dubbanne hin beeku.
We have to go there.	Achi deemuu qabna.
This does not mean, however, that it is necessary.	Kana jechuun garuu dirqama jechuu miti.
Again, it is not necessary.	Ammas dirqama miti.
He told him a good job.	Hojii gaarii itti hime.
Been there and done that.	Achi turee akkas godhe.
He knew this well.	Kana sirriitti beeka ture.
I know how to deal with setbacks.	Duubatti deebi'uu akkamitti akkan danda'u nan beeka.
I don't know why.	Maaliif jedhee hin beeku.
Which doesn't happen.	Kan hin ta'u.
It will never happen.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
None of them were now.	Isaan keessaa amma tokkollee hin turre.
Everything you need.	Waan isin barbaachisu hunda.
Like it never happened.	Akkuma gonkumaa hin taane.
We have a good one.	Tokko gaarii qabna.
None of them did anything.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan tokko hin hojjenne.
I have no issue with that.	Ani dhimma sana irratti hin qabu.
Here we have a completely different situation.	Asitti haala guutummaatti adda ta’e qabna.
Not that you were.	Ati akka turte miti.
There is no other.	Kan biraa hin jiru.
So everyone knew my father.	Kanaaf namni hundi abbaa koo beeka ture.
No one would say he did.	Namni akkas godhe jedhu hin jiru.
No one spoke to me.	Namni natti dubbate hin jiru.
It happens for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
But he couldn't say that.	Garuu akkas jechuu hin dandeenye.
He was still in her life.	Inni ammallee jireenya ishee keessa ture.
This is the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kana.
You don't know me.	Ati na hin beektu.
But he knew it.	Inni garuu ni beeka ture.
I’m always the one in the wrong.	Yeroo hundumaa kan dogoggora keessa jiru ana.
That seems right.	Sun sirrii fakkaata.
Today, however, is different.	Har'a garuu adda.
Which he wants.	Kan inni barbaadu.
I don’t have a good handle on it.	Qabduu gaarii irratti hin qabu.
It wasn’t his way.	Karaa isaa hin turre.
That was never a problem.	Sun gonkumaa rakkoo hin turre.
I think it’s just how it is.	Akkamitti akka jiru qofa natti fakkaata.
This is a good one.	Kun gaarii dha.
On the date in question.	Guyyaa gaaffii keessa jiru irratti.
Not much else to say about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan biraa baay'ee jechuu miti.
Everything has its time.	Wanti hundi yeroo isaa qaba.
This is usually what you want to do.	Yeroo baayyee waan ati gochuu barbaaddu kana.
I didn’t want to ask before.	Kanaan dura gaafachuu hin barbaanne.
Everything looks right.	Wanti hundi sirrii fakkaata.
So long ago .	Kanaaf yeroo dheeraa dura .
Mother that’s it.	Haadha kanuma.
He is in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jira.
One big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa tokko.
Looks good, feels good.	Gaarii fakkaata, miira gaarii qaba.
Maybe I'll just leave you there.	Tarii achitti qofa si dhiisuu danda'a.
But that wasn't the only time it happened.	Garuu yeroo sana qofa miti kan ta'e.
But we have not seen this.	Nuti garuu kana hin argine.
This was pretty simple.	Kun baayyee salphaa ture.
He looked into my hand.	Harka koo keessa ilaale.
It was an important issue.	Dhimma barbaachisaa ture.
So just watch it.	Kanaaf ilaalaa qofa.
That one is mine.	Inni sun kan kooti.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
He was in a terrible state.	Haala hamaa keessa ture.
He has a medical need.	Fedhii yaalaa qaba.
It was very early.	Baayyee dafee ture.
But no one should live here.	Garuu asitti namni jiraachuu hin qabu.
That's how it goes.	Akkasitti deema.
I never got into it.	Gonkumaa keessa hin galle.
I have no idea what is going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada hin qabu.
This may be the right one.	Kun isa sirrii ta’uu danda’a.
We can't but go back.	Nu hin dandeenyu garuu duubatti deebi'uu.
How could he not know.	Akkamitti hin beekne.
This is not a good night’s sleep.	Kun hirriba gaarii miti.
This was true but not necessary.	Kun dhugaa ture garuu barbaachisaa hin turre.
He needed no one but himself.	Ofii malee nama biraa isa hin barbaachifne.
This has to go away.	Kun deemuu qaba.
I love the sound of it.	Sagalee isaa baay'een jaalladha.
They waited for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf eegaa turan.
Now all she wanted was sleep.	Amma wanti isheen barbaaddu hirriba qofa ture.
But still perfect.	Garuu ammas guutuu ta'e.
You must be very alone.	Baay'ee kophaa ta'uu qabda.
If that's the case.	Yoo akkas ta'e.
It is very important to him.	Isaaf baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
No one ever tells me anything.	Namni gonkumaa homaa natti himu hin jiru.
Which we are together.	Kan waliin taane.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun waan kana miti.
I love that girl.	Intala sana nan jaalladha.
But this one certainly does.	Inni kun garuu akka godhu beekamaadha.
But obviously not this time.	Garuu yeroo kana akka hin taane ifaadha.
I could live without either of them.	Isaan lamaan keessaa tokko malee jiraachuu nan dandaʼa ture.
I can't be around people like me.	Namoota akka kootti naannoo ta'uu hin danda'u.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
You are more than enough.	Ati gahaa ol taate.
He wasn’t there.	Inni hin turre.
That’s how it might be.	Akkas ta’uu danda’a.
What he liked, no one was interested.	Waan inni jaallatu, namni fedhii qabu hin turre.
I didn't know anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin beekne.
That’s the truth no one wants to tell.	Dhugaa namni tokkollee dubbachuu hin barbaanne kanuma.
But it seems too obvious.	Garuu garmalee ifa fakkaata.
They could be on to something.	Waan tokko irratti ta'uu danda'u.
Everything went well for me.	Wanti hundi gaarii naaf ta'e.
As usual, he knew what was right.	Akkuma yeroo baay'ee waan sirrii ta'e beeka ture.
There was one possibility.	Carraan tokko ture.
I'm interested in how this happens.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'u irratti fedhii qaba.
This doesn’t feel good.	Kun miira gaarii hin qabu.
It’s not money.	Maallaqa miti.
He will do better tomorrow than he did today.	Boru kan har'a hojjete caalaa ni hojjeta.
I can't do a job.	Hojii tokko gochuu hin danda'u.
He went his way through life.	Jireenya keessa karaa isaa deeme.
But tomorrow it will be.	Boru garuu ni ta'a.
Maybe you're a little bit.	Tarii xiqqoo ta'uu dandeessa.
I don't know any more about it than you do.	Ani akka ati beektu caalaa waa'ee isaa hin beeku.
On the evil eye.	Ija hamaa irratti.
He was going to be fine.	Inni gaarii ta'uuf ture.
I do not know why that is.	Maaliif akkas akka taʼe hin beeku.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
But it wasn’t what you think.	Garuu akka ati yaaddu hin turre.
I think he can help you.	Inni si gargaaruu danda'a jedheen yaada.
Look at our children.	Ijoollee keenya ilaalaa.
It doesn't work like it does now.	Akka ammaatti hin hojjetu.
It will be good for a while now.	Yeroo muraasaaf amma gaarii ta'a.
She didn’t understand any better.	Isheen kana caalaa hin hubanne.
You are not one of them.	Ati isaan keessaa tokko miti.
I mean, not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti jechuu kooti.
Another simple one.	Kan biraa salphaa.
That's what I mean.	Kana jechuu kooti.
We just have to go the right way.	Karaa sirrii irra deemuu qofa qabna.
Can't help what it looks like.	Maal akka fakkaatu gargaaruu hin danda'u.
So you can be like me.	Kanaaf akkuma koo taʼuu dandeessa.
In both cases the old stuff was better.	Haala lamaan keessatti wanti durii caalaa ture.
He no longer seemed to care.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabne fakkaata ture.
It probably should have happened.	Silaa ta'uu qaba ture ta'uu hin oolu.
I know him very well.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka.
It seemed pretty obvious.	Baayyee ifa fakkaata ture.
I don't know what I should go for now.	Amma maal deemuu akkan qabu naaf hin galle.
It would never have been him.	Silaa gonkumaa isa hin ta'u ture.
I want to stay .	Ani turuu nan barbaada .
The problem, however, is obvious.	Rakkoon jiru garuu ifaadha.
It looks good to me.	Natti gaarii fakkaata.
I could never believe it.	Ani gonkumaa amanuu hin dandeenye.
He should stay with us.	Nu bira turuu qaba.
I can afford a new house.	Mana haaraa bitachuu nan danda'a.
The other thing is we had a lot of new ideas.	Inni biraa yaada haaraa hedduu qabna turre.
It seemed hopeless.	Abdii kan hin qabne fakkaata ture.
One of them on its own would have been bad enough.	Isaan keessaa tokko ofuma isaatiin silaa hamaa gahaa ture.
Still waiting for that to happen.	Ammas akka sun ta'u eegaa jira.
I don't think so.	Kun natti hin fakkaatu.
There’s one in every school.	Mana barumsaa hunda keessatti tokko jira.
This is a little part about me.	Kun kutaa xiqqoo waa'ee kooti.
You have to be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu qabda.
That’s usually the case.	Yeroo baay’ee akkas ta’a.
He said he didn't.	Hin goone jedhe.
They love their children.	Ijoollee isaanii ni jaallatu.
They loved each other.	Wal jaallatu turan.
I can't see them.	Isaan arguu hin danda'u.
You know everything you need to know.	Waan beekuu qabdu hunda ni beekta.
He was tall, very tall.	Inni dheeraa, baay'ee dheeraa ture.
Nothing much seems to matter.	Wanti baay'ee dhimma qabu hin fakkaatu.
We don’t have to do anything tonight.	Halkan kana homaa gochuu hin qabnu.
People were nice.	Namoonni gaarii turan.
Part after part.	Kutaa kutaa kutaa booda.
I think about you girl.	Ani waa'ee siif yaada intala.
Perhaps no one is good enough.	Tarii namni gaarii taʼe hin jiru taʼa.
It requires a lot.	Baayyee barbaada.
He was here.	Inni as ture.
So far they had been very lucky, no one had seen them.	Hanga ammaatti baayyee carraa qaban turan, namni isaan arge hin jiru.
I knew my job.	Hojii koo nan beeka ture.
They can tell you everything about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa sitti himuu danda'u.
But then he knew what he had to do.	Sana booda garuu maal gochuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
I don’t need a job.	Hojii na hin barbaachisu.
I love this idea.	Yaada kana baay'een jaalladha.
Almost everything was working against him.	Wanti hundi jechuun ni danda’ama isa irratti hojjechaa ture.
Our hope is in you.	Abdiin keenya isin keessa jira.
It was what he wanted.	Waan inni barbaade ture.
He has one.	Tokko qaba.
He said it all and then some.	Hunda jedhe sana booda tokko tokko.
I love that place so much.	Bakka sana baay'een jaalladha.
Everyone knows someone.	Namni hundi nama tokko beeka.
Nobody in here had it on him.	Namni as keessa jiru isa irratti hin qabu ture.
You know this good man.	Nama gaarii kana ni beektaa.
He wasn’t just tall.	Inni dheeraa qofa hin turre.
If not more than that.	Yoo kana caalaa hin taane.
I really didn’t want to know.	Dhuguma beekuu hin barbaanne.
Then again, that was the old me.	Sana booda ammas, sun ana durii ture.
I don’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku.
I can't say it.	jechuu hin danda'u.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
No one had much to say.	Namni waan baay'ee jedhu hin qabu ture.
I was so not good at this.	Ani akkasitti kana irratti gaarii hin turre.
He knew what that felt like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu ni beeka ture.
But she had something to do.	Garuu waan hojjechuu qabdu qabdi turte.
Which is very bad.	Kan baayyee hamaa ta'e.
So that may not work for me.	Kanaaf sun naaf hojjechuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
Mine never seems to go away.	Kan koo gonkumaa waan deemu hin fakkaatu.
I love working in there.	Achi keessa hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
Maybe it will happen.	Tarii ni ta'a.
He gave him everything he asked for.	Waan inni gaafate hunda isaaf kenne.
Still, no one is around.	Ammas ta'ee namni naannoo sana jiru hin jiru.
Little.	Xiqqoo.
I don't have anything.	Ani homaa hin qabu.
But it still doesn’t seem like a good enough reason.	Garuu ammas sababa gaarii hin fakkaatu.
It has plenty of space.	Bakka baay'ee qaba.
A couple of years.	Waggaa lama lama.
I can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
It’s like my job and stuff.	Akka hojii fi waan kooti.
I still don’t understand them.	Ammallee isaan naaf hin galle.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
I couldn't tell him much about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee itti himuu hin dandeenye.
He gave me a lot of things.	Waan hedduu naaf kenne.
He was three years old at the time.	Yeroo sanatti umuriin isaa waggaa sadii ture.
You're not here anymore.	Kana booda as hin jirtu.
He was the one who needed to know.	Waan beekuu kan qabu isa ture.
She with their daughter.	Isheen intala isaanii waliin.
Living with us.	Nu waliin jiraachuu.
So loud, so very loud.	Akkas sagalee guddaa, akkas baayyee sagalee guddaa.
She couldn't have been.	Ta'uu hin dandeessu turte.
Nothing else worked.	Wanti biraa hin hojjenne.
We have a whole day.	Guyyaa guutuu qabna.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
If it doesn't, it won't.	Yoo hin taane hin ta'u.
No one knew where he was.	Namni eessa akka jiru beeku hin turre.
Everything was clear.	Wanti hundi ifa ture.
I never wanted to do this.	Kana gochuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
It was very clear that this was the case.	Kun akka ta’e baay’ee ifa ture.
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
I won't tell you.	Ani hin himu.
If there is nothing, nothing happens.	Yoo hin jirre wanti ta'u hin jiru.
She didn't think of the possibilities.	Isheen waan ta'uu danda'u hin yaadne.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu dhimma hin qabu.
He is one of us.	Inni nu keessaa tokko.
Too much is happening.	Garmalee waan ta'aa jiru.
Just to help out.	Gargaaruuf qofa.
I knew then.	Yeroo sanatti beeka ture.
Like this house.	Akka mana kanaa.
You have to have a job.	Hojii qabaachuu qabda.
But it will exist.	Garuu ni jiraata.
I like that very much.	Sana baayyee natti tola.
I'm at home.	Ani mana jira.
Only.	Qofa.
This is not an easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa miti.
I had no idea if this thing would work.	Wanti kun ni hojjeta moo hin hojjetu yaada hin qabu ture.
So I wasn’t interested.	Kanaaf fedhii hin qabu ture.
He looked at his shoes.	Kophee isaa ilaale.
I need a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee na barbaachisa.
You really don't want that to happen.	Dhuguma akkas akka ta'u hin barbaaddu.
He doesn’t know what to do with his money.	Maallaqa isaatiin maal akka godhu hin beeku.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
She should have known better.	Silaa caalaatti beekuu qabdi turte.
They are nothing.	Isaan homaa miti.
He was not a great man.	Nama guddaa hin turre.
We made some mistakes.	Dogoggora tokko tokko hojjenne.
Then again, maybe they are.	Sana booda ammas tarii ta'uu danda'u.
But that’s not our job.	Garuu sun hojii keenya miti.
Will it happen? 	Ni ta'aa?
In my room.	Kutaa koo keessatti.
But not a little anymore.	Garuu kana booda xiqqoo miti.
Not with our environment.	Naannoo keenya waliin miti.
Maybe all the time every day.	Tarii yeroo hunda guyyaa hunda.
Like he wanted it that way.	Akkuma inni akkasitti barbaade.
Everyone who knew her loved her.	Namni ishee beeku hundi ishee jaallata ture.
We talked a bit about her then.	Yeroo sanatti waa'ee ishee xiqqoo dubbanne.
He had nowhere else to go.	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin qabu ture.
Never, ever, ever.	Yoomiyyuu, yoomiyyuu, yoomiyyuu.
Not that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura miti.
I know what's good now.	Waan gaarii ta'e amma beeka.
It has a great sound.	Sagalee guddaa qaba.
But this is not clear.	Garuu kun ifa miti.
He had such a good life.	Jireenya gaarii akkasii qaba ture.
It doesn't work today.	Har'a hin hojjetu.
So, even, it has their names.	Kanaaf, illee, maqaa isaanii qaba.
I knew then what this was.	Kun maal akka ta'e yeroo sanatti beeka ture.
That is pretty clear by now.	Sun yeroo ammaatti baayyee ifaadha.
He came to my house today.	Har'a gara mana koo dhufe.
I think you are one.	Ati tokko natti fakkaata.
I know their names.	Maqaa isaanii nan beeka.
Maybe she needs it, maybe she doesn't.	Tarii isheen barbaachisa ta'a, tarii hin barbaachisu ta'a.
It had been quite a day.	Guyyaa baay'ee ta'ee ture.
That, of course, was easier said than done.	Sun, dubbachuu caalaa gochuu caalaa salphaa akka ture beekamaadha.
He must go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qaba.
We are right now.	Nuti yeroo ammaa kana.
Still working on that one.	Ammas isa sana irratti hojjechaa jira.
You can make mistakes along the way.	Karaa irratti dogoggora hojjechuu dandeessa.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Tarii homaa hin qabu.
This is just for us.	Kun nuuf qofa.
Look inside again.	Ammas keessa ilaalaa.
I know exactly what you are going through.	Waan keessa jirtu sirriitti beeka.
You have to ask.	Isin gaafachuu qabda.
He worked very long hours.	Sa'aatii baayyee dheeraa hojjete.
Now he had three.	Amma sadii qaba ture.
It can’t be anything.	Homaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
But he wasn’t quite like that.	Garuu inni guutummaatti akkas hin turre.
I said very little.	Baayyee xiqqoo jedheen.
They help me.	Na gargaaru.
She said who she was.	Eenyu akka taate jette.
We stayed at her house.	Mana ishee bira turre.
But it still doesn’t help.	Garuu ammallee hin gargaaru.
It’s no longer an opinion, obviously.	Kana booda yaada miti, ifaadha.
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
But there is only one.	Garuu tokko qofa.
One.	Tokko.
Tell me again.	Ammas natti himi.
We were just people.	Nuti namoota qofa turre.
We wouldn’t need those.	Silaa warra sana nu hin barbaachisu ture.
He is waiting for me.	Inni na eegaa jira.
Not your parents.	Warra kee miti.
People are working on that.	Namoonni sana irratti hojjechaa jiru.
I came here to do something important.	Waan barbaachisaa tokko hojjechuuf as dhufe.
He knew that feeling all too well.	Miira sana akka gaariitti beeka ture.
But that is not what is happening here.	Garuu asitti wanti ta'aa jiru akkas miti.
I like this work.	Hojiin kun natti tola.
It's more possible.	Caalaatti ni danda'ama.
Good so far so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii.
No one seems to know what is going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru namni beeku hin fakkaatu.
So he knew how it worked.	Kanaaf akkamitti akka hojjetu beeka ture.
But I am happy.	Ani garuu gammadeera.
During the period in question.	Yeroo gaaffii keessa jiru keessatti.
But they don’t mean it.	Garuu jechuu isaanii miti.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
I couldn't believe I could see it.	Arguu danda'a jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye.
His work is really good.	Hojiin isaa dhuguma gaarii dha.
Can you be forgiven?	Dhiifama argachuu dandeessaa?
Maybe they have, but that doesn't make it so.	Tarii qaban ta'a, garuu akkas jechuun akkas hin godhu.
Morning.	Ganama.
He had no sound.	Sagalee hin qabu ture.
But maybe not.	Garuu tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
I knew that girl.	Intala sana nan beeka ture.
He looked towards the house.	Gara manaatti ilaale.
That’s not what he does.	Kana miti kan inni hojjetu.
Better buy your own time.	Yeroo ofii bitachuu wayya.
Just in saying his name.	Maqaa isaa jechuu qofa keessatti.
But there is.	Garuu ni jira.
What are you doing today?	Har'a maal hojjechaa jirta?
Not my children’s names.	Maqaa ijoollee koo miti.
It worked out well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete.
It is not clear why.	Maaliif ifa miti.
A long, long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa dura.
We are there today.	Har'a achi jirra.
He was the one.	Inni turee.
Of course not!	Akka hin taane beekamaadha!
I don’t know if we should help him.	Isa gargaaruu akka qabnu hin beeku.
Great picture, it was.	Suuraa guddaa, ture.
But, there seems to be a problem.	Garuu, rakkoon waan jiru fakkaata.
Everything is not about him.	Wanti hundi waa'ee isaa miti.
I don't know why.	Maaliif hin beeku.
They very probably had.	Baay'ee tarii qaban turan.
I knew this had to be them.	Kun isaan ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture.
Perhaps, he was right.	Tarii, inni sirrii ture.
It did me a lot of good.	Baay'ee gaarii naaf godhe.
They will definitely say they did a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjenne jechuun isaanii hin oolu.
Which is important.	Kan barbaachisaa ta'e.
I like the feeling of simplicity.	Miira salphaa ta'e natti tola.
This one is very nice.	Inni kun baayyee namatti tola.
Only the Father.	Abbaa qofa.
But it seemed inevitable.	Garuu waan hin oolle fakkaata ture.
More people could answer this question better.	Namoonni baay'een gaaffii kanaaf deebii kennuu danda'u wayya ture.
People can walk into me.	Namoonni na keessa deemuu danda'u.
You have to help me.	Na gargaaruu qabda.
Cars and then people.	Konkolaataa fi sana booda namoota.
All of this was on the doorstep.	Kun hundi balbala irra ture.
She can’t stay in her sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa ishee keessa turuu hin dandeessu.
We have plenty of places to catch people.	Bakka namoota itti qabnu hedduu qabna.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
It’s not the day.	Guyyaa miti.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Kana booda gochuu hin dandeenye.
You don’t have any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin qabdu.
He had plenty of time.	Yeroo hedduu qaba ture.
But it was three.	Garuu sadii ture.
I thought about this.	Kanaan yaade.
He could do without doing as he had to.	Akkuma dirqama taʼe gochuu malee gochuu dandaʼa ture.
I couldn’t do anything else.	Waan biraa gochuu hin dandeenye.
There’s no reason we’re not parents.	Sababni nuti warra hin taane hin jiru.
But maybe he didn't need either.	Garuu tarii lamaan isaanii isa hin barbaachifne ta'a.
Everyone knew it.	Namni hundi ni beeka ture.
It is still working.	Hanga ammaatti hojjechaa jira.
Two out of three would be excellent.	Sadii keessaa lama baayyee gaarii ta'a.
People couldn’t do their jobs.	Namoonni hojii isaanii hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
You have to find them.	Isaan argachuu qabda.
It is not necessary to do this.	Kana gochuun barbaachisaa miti.
But not today.	Har'a garuu miti.
They look great and sound great.	Isaan baayyee gaarii fakkaatu, sagalee guddaa qabu.
Not many did.	Baay'een hin goone.
Nothing is more important than that.	Kana caalaa wanti barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru.
She has an issue with the truth.	Dhugaa waliin dhimma qabdi.
He had to come.	Inni dhufuu qaba ture.
Eyes similar to his own.	Ija kan isaa wajjin wal fakkaatu ture.
We would have been together.	Silaa waliin turre.
I mean more in the sense of an interview.	Miira gaaffii fi deebii caalaa jechuu kooti.
We had enough of us.	Nu gahaa qabna turre.
Not that there's anything he can do.	Wanti inni gochuu danda'u jira jechuu miti.
We sit down, we can't do anything else.	Taa'a, waan biraa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
That's the most important thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma.
But look at them.	Garuu isaan ilaalaa.
It goes this way.	Karaa kanaan deema.
Sometimes it's kind of funny.	Yeroo tokko tokko akka waan qoosaa ta'a.
That's how it is, of course.	Akkasitti akkas ta'uu isaa beekamaadha.
Good luck you’re on your way.	Carraa gaarii karaa irra jirta.
It can't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I just don't know how to do this.	Ani garuu akkamitti akka kana godhu hin beeku.
I don't know, not being one.	Hin beeku, tokko ta'uu miti.
He doesn’t do anything for me.	Inni homaa naaf hin godhu.
But that's about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa kanuma.
That was a very important time.	Yeroon sun yeroo baayʼee baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
I couldn’t stay here long.	Yeroo dheeraa as turuu hin dandeenye.
I don't understand that.	Sana naaf hin galle.
He didn’t want me.	Inni na hin barbaanne.
A guy that no one really knew.	Gurbaa dhuguma namni hin beekne.
It's not clear exactly when this happened.	Kun yoom akka ta'e sirriitti ifa miti.
It certainly seemed likely.	Waan taʼuu dandaʼu akka fakkaatu beekamaadha.
So, it matters to him.	Kanaaf, isaaf dhimma qaba.
Now, that doesn't sound too bad.	Amma, sun baayyee hamaa hin fakkaatu.
But they could have known.	Garuu beekuu danda'u turan.
I wasn’t here, last year.	Ani as hin turre, bara darbe.
I couldn’t get any better.	Kana caalaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I think he disagreed with that.	Kana irratti walii hin galle jedheen yaada.
They are still dangerous.	Ammallee balaa qabu.
It was still early.	Ammas dafee ture.
There is nothing.	Wanti tokko hin jiru.
He seems like a good guy.	Gurbaa gaarii fakkaata.
She is very emotional.	Baayyee miira qabdi.
I could do the part.	Kutaa sana hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture.
I know you can’t see everything.	Waan hundumaa arguu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka.
You have it.	Ati qabda.
They shouldn’t see it.	Arguu hin qaban.
I don't love you.	Si hin jaalladhu.
This was not a house.	Kun mana hin turre.
It’s a little too good.	Xiqqoo garmalee gaarii dha.
I love them so much.	Ani baay'een isaan jaalladha.
It’s extremely dangerous right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana garmalee balaa qaba.
She was completely different right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana guutummaatti adda turte.
I hope someone can help.	Namni tokko akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
He had none of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Everyone does this.	Namoonni hundi kana godhu.
That's where we need to be.	Bakka ta'uu qabnu kanuma.
A lot of these people want it a lot more than I do.	Namoonni kun baay'een isaanii ana caalaa baay'ee barbaadu.
Had a great sleep sleep at night.	Hirriba guddaa qaba ture halkan hirriba.
That’s how it should work.	Akkasitti hojjechuu qaba.
It may be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
These were just a few.	Isaan kun muraasa qofa turan.
You can't be evil.	Hamaa ta'uu hin dandeessu.
He had a house there.	Achitti mana qaba ture.
What you have to do.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Nama tokkollee arguu hin barbaadu.
She knew nothing about her life now.	Waa'ee jireenya ishee amma homaa hin beektu turte.
There must be a problem.	Rakkoon jiraachuu qaba.
This has always been a problem.	Kun yeroo hundumaa rakkoo ture.
I didn’t want to but I had to.	Hin barbaanne garuu dirqama ture.
Your questions as.	Gaaffii keessan akkuma.
You should know them.	Isaan beekuu qabdu.
He thought it was all true.	Inni hundi dhugaa ta'uu isaa yaade.
Inside us.	Nu keessa.
But maybe she did.	Garuu tarii isheen akkas goote ta'a.
That doesn't mean that.	Akkas jechuu miti.
She made it look so easy.	Akkas salphaa akka fakkaatu goote.
This will be your room.	Kun kutaa keessan ta'a.
I'd rather go now.	Amma deemuu naaf wayya.
Other than that, it was just another day.	Kanaan ala guyyaa biraa qofa ture.
She said he spoke to you.	Sitti dubbate jette.
But I don't know what he said.	Ani garuu maal akka jedhe hin beeku.
I couldn't see very well.	Baay'ee gaarii arguu hin dandeenye.
It would be nothing like real life.	Silaa akka jireenya dhugaa homaa hin ta'u ture.
From this idea.	Yaada kana irraa.
He was a good guy.	Inni nama gaarii ture.
You don't think about it.	Homaa itti hin yaaddu.
He got very few.	Baayyee muraasa argate.
He didn’t do anything good here.	Asitti waan gaarii tokkollee hin hojjenne.
He would have done that.	Silaa akkas godha ture.
I was just like that.	Ani akkas qofa ture.
But this is not a serious problem to have.	Garuu kun rakkoo hamaa qabaachuu qabu miti.
I wondered what she really said.	Dhuguma maal jette jedheen yaade.
It's just a girl.	Intala qofa.
But it’s really no big deal.	Garuu dhuguma waan guddaa miti.
It is not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin qabu.
You’re that person.	Ati nama sana.
Most of the time it works well.	Yeroo baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I couldn’t believe this.	Kana amanuu hin dandeenye.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
Maybe even true.	Tarii dhugaa illee ta'uu danda'a.
He couldn't live his whole life.	Jireenya isaa guutuu hin dandeenye.
He said it was good.	Inni gaarii jedhe.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
Without it, what we have is not so clear.	Isa malee wanti nuti qabnu hangas ifa miti.
I don't know anything about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku.
All we can do is hope.	Wanti gochuu dandeenyu abdii qofa.
You are looking for an adult.	Nama guddaa barbaadaa jirta.
It was very lonely.	Baay'ee kophaa ture.
That doesn't matter.	Sun homaa hin qabu.
Great job though.	Hojii guddaa garuu.
Where are we going with this?.	Kanaan eessa deemaa jirra?.
She’s just a little girl.	Isheen intala xiqqoo qofa.
He couldn’t find his hat.	Kophee isaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
To his eyes.	Gara ija isaatti.
I don’t think she did.	Isheen waan goote natti hin fakkaatu.
I want to know someone about that.	Waa'ee sanaa nama tokko beekuu barbaada.
You were never there.	Ati gonkumaa achi hin turre.
This was his job.	Kun hojii isaa ture.
There is nothing we can do with her.	Ishee waliin wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
She is my wife.	Isheen haadha manaa kooti.
He had three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba ture.
We are still going.	Ammas deemaa jirra.
It’s almost irrelevant.	Barbaachisaa hin taane jechuun ni danda’ama.
He is not one of you.	Inni isin keessaa tokko miti.
I'm sure he wouldn't have made a mistake.	Silaa dogoggora akka hin hojjenne mirkanaa'adha.
It will be more likely.	Caalaatti ni ta'a.
That's why she said it seems.	Kanaaf fakkaata jette.
But it wasn’t and it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre hin turre.
She doesn't have time.	Yeroo hin qabdu.
But that’s exactly it.	Garuu sirriitti kanuma.
Just one of you guys.	Isin keessaa tokko qofa.
But she had no way of knowing that.	Garuu karaa itti kana beektu hin qabdu turte.
This is certainly not the case.	Kun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But you will know in time.	Garuu yeroon ni beekta.
If it works for you, then it will.	Yoo siif hojjete, sana booda ni hojjeta.
We are watching you.	Isin ilaalaa jirra.
He saw what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru arge.
I have no idea.	Yaada hin qabu.
He didn’t care that much for me.	Inni hangas naaf dhimma hin qabu ture.
We have one person in that house.	Mana sana keessa nama tokko qabna.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
But that took time and money.	Garuu sun yeroo fi maallaqa barbaada ture.
I wondered what they were looking at.	Maal ilaalaa jiru jedheen yaade.
Better that than nothing.	Homaa hin taane caalaa sana wayya.
Something was about to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf jedha ture.
You weren’t yourself.	Ati ofii kee hin turre.
I didn't tell him anything else.	Anis waan biraa itti hin himne.
Perhaps he could live off them.	Tarii isaan irraa jiraachuu dandaʼa taʼa.
Very much like that.	Baayyee akkas.
I don't know where it could be.	Eessa ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
But it’s right.	Garuu sirrii dha.
You know, it shouldn't be like that.	Beektaa akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
I don't have a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee hin qabu.
This has been life for this man so far.	Kun hanga ammaatti nama kanaaf jireenya ta'ee jira.
I need a job.	Hojiin na barbaachisa.
It was a situation.	Haala ture.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I knew it, too.	Anis beeka ture.
For hours at night.	Halkan sa'aatii dheeraaf.
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
No one else understood.	Namni biraa hin hubanne.
That was important.	Sun barbaachisaa ture.
Then again, they might quit.	Sana booda ammas, dhiisuu dandaʼu.
None of this is certain.	Kun tokkollee mirkanaa’aa miti.
He wanted to see his father.	Abbaa isaa arguu barbaade.
I need this.	Kana na barbaachisa.
This was a serious problem.	Kun rakkoo hamaa ture.
Mine and yours.	Kan koo fi kan kee.
I think it will be soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti ni ta'a jedheen yaada.
So he went away.	Kanaaf ni deeme.
I don't know what happened with me.	Waan na waliin ta'e hin beeku.
That’s on a good day.	Sun guyyaa gaarii irratti.
He wanted to live.	Jiraachuu barbaade.
You have to know me.	Na beekuu qabda.
We didn’t become.	Nuti hin taane.
But she didn't know why.	Garuu maaliif akka ta'e hin beektu turte.
He didn't do this.	Kana hin goone.
You know you have to leave her.	Ishee dhiisuu akka qabdu beekta.
Not very often.	Yeroo baay'ee miti.
Everything is fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii dha.
They needed help.	Gargaarsa isaan barbaachisa ture.
And yet it happened.	Ammas ta'ee.
Now, repeat after me.	Amma, na booda irra deebi'i.
Not that it matters though.	Akka dhimma qabu miti garuu.
He belonged here.	Inni kan as ture.
That doesn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu.
So much for that.	Kanaaf baay'ee.
That’s not a problem.	Sun rakkoo miti.
Except, it isn’t.	Malee, miti.
I thought he would leave.	Inni ni deema jedheen yaade.
He wanted to respond.	Deebii kennuu barbaade.
The worst of the worst.	Hamaa keessaa isa hamaa.
That’s how he came to me.	Akkasitti gara koo dhufe.
I didn’t talk to her.	Ishee waliin hin dubbanne.
We have to go.	Deemu qabna.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu qofa hin beeku.
We seem to be great here.	Asitti waan guddaa taane fakkaata.
That was no small thing.	Sun waan xiqqoo hin turre.
Few people know this.	Kana kan beeku namoonni muraasa.
I know that, now.	Ani sana beeka, amma.
I mean, though.	Jechuun koo garuu.
Even a little bit.	Xiqqoo illee.
He didn’t know anything.	Inni homaa hin beeku ture.
Maybe they will go.	Tarii ni deemu ta'a.
This shouldn’t have happened.	Kun ta’uu hin qabu ture.
I never thought that was possible.	Sun ni danda'ama jedhee hin beeku.
It worked, after a while.	Hojjete, yeroo tokko booda.
Nothing is doing anything.	Wanti homaa hojjetu hin jiru.
So we did that.	Kanaaf akkas goone.
I didn’t want him to go.	Akka inni deemu hin barbaanne.
But it doesn't need to be that way any more.	Garuu kana caalaa akkas ta'uu hin barbaachisu.
He should have known better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
Nobody does that anymore.	Kana booda namni akkas godhu hin jiru.
I had no idea if this thing would work.	Wanti kun ni hojjeta moo hin hojjetu yaada hin qabu ture.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
It may not be true for you.	Siif dhugaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
You could be in a very dangerous situation.	Haala baayʼee balaa qabu keessa jiraachuu dandeessa.
It was in the eyes.	Ija keessa ture.
Maybe it will be next year.	Tarii bara dhufu ta'a.
He is in there.	Inni achi keessa jira.
We need new ways.	Karaa haaraa nu barbaachisa.
Maybe you didn't think of it that way.	Tarii akkasitti hin yaadne ta'a.
I thought he would be great.	Inni guddaa ta'a jedheen yaade.
She was looking at herself.	Ofii ishee ilaalaa turte.
That's all I can do.	Kana qofa gochuu danda'a.
It’s great, just what he needs.	Guddaa dha, waan isa barbaachisu qofa.
But not in this case.	Garuu haala kana keessatti miti.
We did the work we had to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabna turre hojjenne.
A lot of it obviously comes from your own life.	Baay'een isaa jireenya ofii irraa akka dhufu ifaadha.
I can't be sure about that.	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Check it out today!.	Har'a ilaalaa!.
I'm not sure, really.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti, dhuguma.
I thought we were friends.	Hiriyyoota taane natti fakkaate.
That’s what he wanted.	Kan inni barbaade kanuma.
Who knew she was with us.	Nu waliin akka jirtu eenyutu beeka.
We should have seen him.	Silaa isa arguu qabna turre.
Everything is working.	Wanti hundi hojjechaa jira.
Now, there it is.	Amma, achi jira.
He asked you.	Inni si gaafate.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
Everyone seemed happy.	Namni hundi waan gammade fakkaata ture.
We still have a lot to do.	Ammas waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabna.
I love doing work.	Hojii hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
I haven’t seen it before.	Kanaan dura hin argine.
You still have them.	Ammallee isaan qabda.
That’s just wrong.	Sun dogoggora qofa.
Perhaps that is the problem.	Tarii rakkoon sun kanuma taʼuu dandaʼa.
He had been the one.	Inni ta'ee ture.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
I thought they would go.	Ni deemu jedheen yaade.
Not how it is.	Akkamitti akka jiru miti.
Without anything else.	Waan tokko malee.
Maybe it's too easy.	Tarii garmalee salphaa ta'uu danda'a.
Do you think you can eat like that?.	Akkasitti nyaachuu dandeessa jettanii yaaddu?.
I don't know.	Ani hin beeku.
I mean, he’s not that kind of guy.	Inni gurbaa akkasii miti jechuu kooti.
He wasn’t home yet.	Ammallee mana hin turre.
But otherwise it is correct.	Garuu yoo kana hin taane sirrii dha.
He didn’t tell me anything at all.	Tasumaa homaa natti hin himne.
We need to know what is in our food.	Nyaata keenya keessa maaltu akka jiru beekuu qabna.
I looked over at her.	Anis gara biraa ishee ilaale.
But that's what's happening here.	Garuu asitti waan ta'aa jiru kanuma.
I think it's about the same.	Waa'ee wal fakkaatu natti fakkaata.
I know everything.	Waan hundumaa nan beeka.
He is really doing this.	Dhuguma kana gochaa jira.
I have it now.	Amma qaba.
But they .	Garuu isaan .
It just happened on its own.	Ofii isaatiin qofa ta'e.
With her.	Ishee waliin.
But there is one thing.	Waan tokko garuu jira.
As they are in the present.	Akkuma yeroo ammaa keessa jiru.
He’s not coming.	Inni hin dhufu.
You made it happen.	Ati akkas akka ta'u goote.
Started a new diet.	Nyaata haaraa jalqabe.
Which is how we were.	Kan nuti akkasitti turre.
From before we met.	Osoo wal hin argine irraa.
But that may not be such a bad thing.	Garuu sun waan hamaa akkasii ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I love it so much.	Ani baay'een jaalladha.
But he had his reasons.	Garuu sababa isaa qaba ture.
I don't know if that's a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
But, it didn’t work.	Garuu, hin hojjenne.
But it's him.	Garuu isa.
I still don’t do it.	Ammallee hin godhu.
Today was a pretty great day.	Har'a guyyaa baayyee guddaa ture.
Be right to go this afternoon.	Har'a waaree booda deemuun keessan sirrii ta'aa.
Now you know.	Amma beekta.
She can’t do that.	Isheen akkas gochuu hin dandeessu.
I can't say anything yet.	Hanga ammaatti homaa jechuu hin danda'u.
Now it’s extremely dangerous.	Amma garmalee balaa qaba.
I knew it was going.	Akka deemaa jiru nan beeka ture.
I have no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabu.
We have a room here.	Asitti kutaa qabna.
He would go right to them.	Inni sirriitti isaan bira ni deema ture.
We have to go now.	Amma deemuu qabna.
He doesn't care.	Inni dhimma hin qabu.
It was a good year.	Bara gaarii ture.
That might help.	Sun gargaaruu dandaʼa.
I just don't know about the guy.	Waa'ee gurbaa sanaa qofa hin beeku.
But they were there for a while.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf achi turan.
What do you think.	Maal sitti fakkaata.
It seemed obvious.	Waan ifa ta'e fakkaata ture.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkasitti ta'uu hin qabu.
He was not in danger.	Balaa keessa hin turre.
So he has to do it.	Kanaaf gochuu qaba.
This is going to be a big, full year for him.	Kun bara guddaa, guutuu isaaf ta'uuf jira.
I’m not making it easy.	Salphaa gochaa hin jiru.
Someone is here.	Namni tokko as jira.
He always says that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedha.
He is here, not in his place.	Bakka isaa osoo hin taane as jira.
She had no idea what that could be.	Sun maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
It was a huge mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa ture.
We have to make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuu qabna.
It’s a long road, just one day.	Karaa dheeraa dha, guyyaa tokko qofa.
What was the reason?	Sababni isaa maali ture?
I want one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko barbaada.
But it wasn't going to be that easy.	Garuu akkas salphaa ta'uuf hin turre.
she said.	jette.
What he was doing was very simple.	Waan inni hojjechaa ture baay'ee salphaa ture.
Maybe that was good enough.	Tarii sun gaarii ture ta'a.
It’s not local here.	Asitti naannoo miti.
All this	Kun hundi .
His life, our life.	Jireenya isaa, jireenya keenya.
So that seems like a big problem.	Kanaaf sun rakkoo guddaa fakkaata.
He has his own.	Kan isaa qaba.
He was looking for a job.	Hojii barbaadaa ture.
I love that job.	Hojii sana nan jaalladha.
You think you’re still in it.	Ammallee keessa akka jirtu sitti fakkaata.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
But there was a problem with that.	Garuu sana irratti rakkoon ture.
Maybe even worse.	Tarii kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
She was a schoolteacher.	Barsiisaa mana barumsaa turte.
I can't say anything about that.	Waa'ee sanaa homaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Maybe that's just how you think it should be.	Tarii akkas ta'uu qaba jettee yaaddu qofa ta'uu danda'a.
But it's not about that anymore.	Garuu kana booda waa'ee kanaa miti.
I don’t have anyone.	Ani nama hin qabu.
This has been going on for a long time.	Kun yeroo dheeraaf deemaa tureera.
There weren't many.	Baay'een hin turre.
This is always important.	Kun yeroo hundumaa barbaachisaa dha.
Maybe he even loves you.	Tarii illee si jaallata ta'a.
Not that he has much.	Waan hedduu qaba jechuu miti.
Then he thought about it.	Sana booda itti yaade.
He had a good reason.	Sababa gaarii qaba ture.
Of course, this was not the only reason.	Sababni isaa kana qofa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
You are among friends.	Hiriyyoota keessa jirta.
That she did.	Akka isheen goote.
He was much taller than her.	Inni ishee caalaa baayyee dheeraa ture.
There is, and it will be.	Ni jira, ni ta'a.
I’m going to work with this.	Kanaan hojjechuuf deema.
It is day and night.	Halkan fi guyyaa dha.
But this is our mother.	Garuu kun haadha keenya.
You have to live together.	Waliin jiraachuu qabda.
I want you to do what you want to do.	Waan gochuu barbaaddu akka gootu nan barbaada.
We mean more than that.	Kana caalaa jechuu keenya.
I don’t know where he is right now.	Yeroo ammaa eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
He wanted to know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e beekuu barbaade.
I wondered how I could make it happen.	Akkamitti akka ta'u gochuu danda'a jedheen yaade.
You are in the right place.	Bakka sirrii jirta.
It will be a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii ta'a.
I'm not sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti.
It happened to me too.	Ana illee ta'e.
He tried to make himself think nothing of it.	Homaa akka hin yaadne of gochuuf yaale.
They were rarely dangerous here.	Asitti balaa kan qaban yeroo muraasa turan.
It's not being much help.	Gargaarsa guddaa ta'aa hin jiru.
But it couldn't exist.	Garuu jiraachuu hin danda'u ture.
I don't know that to be true.	Sana dhugaa ta'uuf hin beeku.
We did a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjenne.
But he didn't do that.	Garuu akkas hin goone.
It never, ever happened.	Gonkumaa, gonkumaa hin taane.
The timing was right.	Yeroon sun sirrii ture.
Something about time.	Waa'ee yeroo waan tokko.
I couldn't talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
It was obvious that something had happened.	Waan tokko akka ta'e ifa ture.
You tell me why.	Ati maaliif akka ta'e natti himi.
They are doing what they need to do.	Waan gochuu qaban hojjechaa jiru.
I don't know where he is but somewhere.	Bakka tokko malee eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
It's obviously happening.	Ta'aa akka jiru ifaadha.
This is not specific enough.	Kun adda gahaa miti.
Just my name.	Maqaa koo qofa.
No one could say she didn’t love her kids.	Namni ijoollee ishee hin jaallattu jechuu hin dandeenye.
I need more people tonight.	Halkan kana namoota hedduu barbaada.
Not even that.	Kana illee miti.
I didn’t say anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa hin dubbanne.
We would never do it.	Yoomiyyuu hin goonu turre.
The problem of good ideas.	Rakkoo yaada gaarii.
There is nothing else to say.	Waan biraa jedhu hin jiru.
This had happened on her watch.	Kun sa'aatii ishee irratti ta'ee ture.
No one else wants us.	Namni biraa nu barbaadu hin jiru.
So who is it?.	Kanaaf eenyu?.
I will be his father.	Ani abbaa isaa ta'a.
I would have gone higher.	Silaa kana caalaa ol deema ture.
I thought that might work.	Sun hojjechuu danda'a jedheen yaade.
I have that.	Ani sana qaba.
I had to do what was best for him.	Waan isaaf gaarii taʼe gochuun qaba ture.
Now we have a lot of things.	Amma waan baay'ee qabna.
I can't go.	Ani deemuu hin danda'u.
I'll be a bad person.	Ani nama hamaa ta'a.
We knew each other for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf wal beekne.
It's still morning	Ammallee ganama
Maybe it's not.	Tarii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
But it still didn’t happen.	Garuu ammas hin taane.
It's very dangerous.	Baay'ee balaa qaba.
I hope you are doing well.	Akka gaariitti akka jirtu abdiin qaba.
Maybe you can't.	Tarii hin dandeessu taʼa.
He had good hands.	Harka gaarii qaba ture.
He must know.	Inni beekuu qaba.
It can do us good in both ways.	Karaa lamaan gaarii nuuf gochuu danda’a.
He says everything will be fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'a jedha.
Someone had to do it.	Namni tokko gochuu qaba ture.
He didn't know.	Inni hin beeku ture.
I had her.	Ani ishee qaba ture.
He wants her there.	Achitti ishee barbaada.
She didn’t know any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee isheen hin beekne.
It seems obvious that they have.	Akka qaban ifa fakkaata.
Where are we going?	Eessa deemaa jirra?
We’re both there.	Lamaan keenyayyuu jirra.
I don't	Ani hin .
His real life.	Jireenya isaa isa dhugaa.
They didn’t realize that someone was watching them.	Namni tokko akka isaan ilaalaa jiru hin hubanne.
There is no interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii hin jiru.
But it works well.	Garuu akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Really glad to see you.	Dhuguma si arguu kootti gammadeera.
Those were the good old days.	Yeroon sun bara gaarii durii ture.
I didn’t know how it would work here.	Asitti akkamitti akka hojjetu hin beeku ture.
I hadn’t seen it.	Ani hin argine ture.
Perhaps you were expecting something different.	Tarii waan adda taʼe eegaa turte taʼa.
You know you can’t.	Akka hin dandeenye beekta.
Everything was the same.	Wanti hundi tokko ture.
They were still waiting.	Ammas eegaa turan.
The most important thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
It's not going to be that easy.	Akkas salphaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
You know you are mine.	Kan koo ta'uu kee ni beekta.
More than that, it was much more.	Kana caalaa, baayyee caalaa ture.
I was not interested at all.	Ani tasumaa fedhii hin qabu ture.
Someone made a mistake.	Namni tokko dogoggora hojjete.
They can see it.	Arguu danda'u.
I don’t understand why you overthink everything.	Maaliif waan hundumaa garmalee akka yaaddu naaf hin galle.
Nothing happened after that.	Sana booda wanti ta'e hin jiru.
Then we were at my place.	Sana booda bakka kootti turre.
Not much more now.	Amma kana caalaa baay'ee miti.
It looked like a good one.	Isa gaarii fakkaata ture.
It had to be what it had to be.	Waan ta'uu qabu ta'uu qaba ture.
But in some cases they can be.	Garuu haala tokko tokko keessatti ta’uu danda’u.
You can do more than you think.	Waan ati yaaddu caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa.
It made it easy for him.	Salphaa isaaf godhe.
So it can be done.	Kanaaf gochuun ni danda'ama.
It's just one thing.	Waan tokko qofa.
There is no one here.	Namni asitti hin jiru.
You don’t want to know why someone did something.	Namni tokko maaliif waan tokko akka hojjete beekuu hin barbaaddu.
I'm not sure it's 'right' though.	'sirrii' ta'uu isaa garuu mirkanaa'aa miti.
Certainly not something that should happen often.	Waan yeroo baayyee ta'uu qabu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But there is a reality.	Garuu dhugaa jiru.
You really don’t.	Dhuguma hin gootu.
You are still in danger.	Ammallee balaa keessa jirta.
But we don't.	Nuti garuu hin goonu.
She must have been waiting for me.	Isheen na eegaa turte taʼuu qabdi.
You never know what could happen.	Waan ta'uu danda'u gonkumaa hin beektu.
It was mean to her.	Ishee irratti hamaa ture.
He wants you to know that you are not.	Ati akka hin taane akka beektu barbaada.
That's how it happened.	Akkasitti ta'e.
Just like me.	Akkuma koo.
But I can't do that anymore.	Kana booda garuu sana gochuu hin danda'u.
I’m really happy with that.	Dhuguma sanatti gammadeera.
I hope that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
Even his voice.	Sagalee isaa illee.
People want houses.	Namoonni mana barbaadu.
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
This time I was sure.	Yeroo kana mirkanaa'aa ture.
He hadn't thought of that.	Inni akkas jedhee hin yaadne ture.
That doesn’t mean it’s now.	Kana jechuun amma miti.
He hadn’t said anything yet.	Hanga ammaatti homaa hin dubbanne ture.
It wasn’t a good feeling.	Miira gaarii hin turre.
Out here, things are a little different.	As ala, wanti xiqqoo adda.
None had promises.	Tokkollee waadaa hin qabu ture.
It doesn't have to be.	Dirqama ta'uu hin qabu.
His eyes	Ija isaa
It just seems so wrong.	Akkas dogoggora qofa fakkaata.
He should have known something was wrong.	Silaa wanti tokko dogoggora akka jiru beekuu qaba ture.
They are not very interested in this idea.	Yaada kanaaf baay'ee fedhii hin qaban.
But it’s more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa.
He looked everyone in the eye.	Nama hunda ija keessa ilaale.
How does he do this?	Akkamitti kana godha?
That’s our only problem.	Rakkoon keenya kanuma qofa.
Like they still have jobs.	Akkuma ammallee hojii qaban.
I was nothing to him.	Ani isaaf homaa hin turre.
I don't mean it.	Ani jechuu koo miti.
My mother-in-law.	Haadha koo.
Every morning and every night.	Ganama fi halkan hunda.
They know that's all.	Isaan kana qofa akka ta'e beeku.
This is working great.	Kun baayyee hojjechaa jira.
He wanted to go quickly.	Dafee deemuu barbaade.
Very good, very good.	Baayyee gaarii, baayyee gaarii.
I'm sure he will with you.	Si waliin akka godhu mirkanaa'adha.
I know what you want and where it is.	Waan barbaaddu fi eessa akka jiru nan beeka.
Three or more.	Sadii fi isaa ol.
He had to have people.	Namoota qabaachuu qaba ture.
It worked out.	Ni hojjete.
They so badly want to believe the best in their kids.	Isaan akka malee ijoollee isaanii keessaa isa gaarii amanuu barbaadu.
That it will be.	Akka ta'a.
I wasn't sure why he was coming.	Maaliif akka dhufu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Only it wasn't his.	Qofa kan isaa hin turre.
It must be hers.	Kan ishee ta'uu qaba.
But I will say this.	Kana garuu nan jedha.
. . . .	.
He had only three houses.	Mana sadii qofa qaba ture.
I had to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii taʼe gochuun qaba ture.
But for the time being, he is not human.	Garuu yeroo kanaaf nama miti.
That goes both ways.	Sun karaa lamaan deema.
They were all promises.	Hundi isaanii waadaa turan.
I do have a couple of suggestions though.	Ani yaada tokko lama qaba garuu.
He wouldn't have.	Silaa hin qabu ture.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
She needs some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko ishee barbaachisa.
What's going to happen to you?	Maaltu si ta'a?
They know us better.	Isaan caalaatti nu beeku.
He went out of his way to help.	Gargaaruuf karaa isaa ba'e.
They are me.	Isaan ana.
You can, but not me.	Ni dandeessa, garuu ana miti.
What's going on? 	Maaltu ta'aa jira?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I’m not just saying that.	Ani kana qofa jechuu koo miti.
This work looks good.	Hojiin kun gaarii fakkaata.
So it's not good.	Eegaa gaarii miti.
It’s always there.	Yeroo hunda achi jira.
He thought his chance had passed.	Carraan isaa waan darbe itti fakkaate.
It must be just you.	Si qofa ta'uu qaba.
I think you can do it.	Ni dandeessu jedheen yaada.
Now there were only two.	Amma lama qofa turan.
I made it work.	Ani akka hojjetu godhe.
Both of you.	Lamaan keessan.
But I didn't think much of it.	Garuu baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
I love.	Ani nan jaalladha.
He has a chance without us.	Nu malee carraa qaba.
It still wouldn’t work.	Ammallee hin hojjetu ture.
But we still had some.	Garuu ammallee tokko tokko qabna turre.
It seems like a good thing.	Waan gaarii fakkaata.
Fortunately, it came out.	Akka carraa ta'ee ba'e.
Really great house.	Dhuguma mana guddaa.
He was that bad.	Inni akkas hamaa ture.
It was very accurate.	Baayyee sirrii ture.
It was a terrible interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii hamaa ture.
I can't quite do it tomorrow.	Boru guutummaatti hin danda'u.
You have him.	Ati isa qabda.
Only, it wasn’t.	Qofa, hin turre.
It doesn’t go away.	Hin deemu.
But that wasn’t always the case.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre.
I looked good.	Ani gaarii fakkaata ture.
If not already.	Yoo amma dura hin taane.
Something we couldn’t even see.	Waan nuti illee arguu hin dandeenye.
Here I am with you.	Asitti si waliin jira.
I have no idea what to say.	Waan jedhu yaada hin qabu.
I would say yours.	Silaa keessan jedha.
I don't do anything.	Ani homaa hin godhu.
I don’t like people.	Namoota hin jaalladhu.
I could have told.	Silaa himuu nan danda'a ture.
I want to believe her.	Ishee amanuu barbaada.
Everything we’ve done together.	Waan waliin hojjenne hunda.
She has a lot in common with them.	Isaan waliin waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu qabdi.
But that’s not even a bad thing.	Garuu sun waan hamaa illee miti.
I know better.	Ani caalaatti beeka.
We have a lot to say.	Waan baay'ee jechuu qabna.
I’m going to help him.	Isa gargaaruuf nan deema.
People are looking for us.	Namoonni nu barbaadaa jiru.
Someone about.	Namni waa'ee.
Very happy to be here.	As jiraachuu kootti baay'een gammade.
We have a chance.	Carraa qabna.
Something about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan tokko.
He certainly looked the part.	Inni kutaa sana akka ilaale beekamaadha.
He found one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko argate.
The new one.	Kan haaraa.
But that was not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas hin turre.
You have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
They are just so good.	Isaan akkas qofa gaarii dha.
I just won’t go away for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa hin deemu.
That he really loves it.	Akka inni dhuguma jaallatu.
But it didn’t happen that way.	Garuu akkas hin taane.
I don't have her.	Ani ishee hin qabu.
She was his own.	Isheen kan isaa turte.
Very obvious, again.	Baayyee ifaadha, ammas.
She knew nothing anymore.	Kana booda homaa hin beektu turte.
I think that feeling.	Miira sana natti fakkaata.
That’s not how mine is.	Akkas miti kan koo.
Now he was going.	Amma deemaa ture.
There should have been.	Silaa jiraachuu qaba ture.
I don't want to.	Ani hin barbaadu.
But she didn't know that.	Isheen garuu kana hin beektu turte.
No one can see me.	Namni na arguu hin danda'u.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
You have little time.	Yeroo xiqqoo qabda.
You don’t have to, but you just can’t help it.	Gochuu hin qabdu, garuu gargaaruu hin dandeessu qofa.
She was so tiny.	Isheen akka malee xiqqoo turte.
I don't know this person.	Nama kana hin beeku.
You are where you want to be.	Bakka ta'uu barbaaddu jirta.
They love him in there.	Achi keessa isa jaallatu.
But she is my wife.	Isheen garuu haadha manaa kooti.
Asking each other things.	Waan wal gaafachuu.
Look at that guy, people would say.	Gurbaa sana ilaalaa, namoonni jedhu turan.
She needs your help.	Gargaarsa keessan ishee barbaachisa.
At that point he won’t be around for long.	Yeroo sanatti yeroo dheeraaf hin jiru.
It doesn’t mean there isn’t.	Hin jiru jechuu miti.
There was no one around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin turre.
We have a great place for it.	Bakka guddaa itti qabna.
That was it, I just saw it.	Kana ture, amma arge.
It would have been.	Silaa ta'a ture.
You don’t need it.	Si hin barbaachisu.
But it shouldn't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin qabu.
But now, he wanted more.	Amma garuu, kana caalaa barbaade.
You just don't know what it's about.	Waa'ee maal akka ta'e qofa hin beektu.
The more extreme, the better.	Hamma garmalee ta'e, gaarii dha.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
That was pretty bad!.	Sun baayyee hamaa ture!.
Some people are like that.	Namoonni tokko tokko akkas.
Not sure why it didn't work.	Maaliif akka hin hojjenne mirkanaa'aa miti.
They had a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa deemuu qabu turan.
We should do all we can to help children.	Ijoollee gargaaruuf waan dandeenyu hunda gochuu qabna.
Of course, everyone needs to do such things.	Namni hundi wantoota akkasii gochuu akka qabu beekamaadha.
He found his true self after a terrible accident.	Balaa hamaa booda ofii isaa isa dhugaa argate.
He seemed to be somewhere else.	Bakka biraa waan jiru fakkaata ture.
Her thoughts, not hers.	Yaada ishee malee yaada ishee miti.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
Then there is such .	Sana booda kan akkasii jira .
It was working, but you can’t see it.	Hojjechaa ture, garuu arguu hin dandeessu.
I saw that picture this morning.	Suuraa sana ganama kana arge.
But it was what they needed.	Garuu waan isaan barbaachisu ture.
Look at them carefully.	Isaan sirriitti ilaalaa.
I just thought maybe I knew this dog.	Tarii saree kana beeka jedheen yaade qofa.
It's a simple idea.	Yaada salphaa ta'e.
It couldn't have been.	Ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
If not, it's no big deal, just set back.	Yoo hin taane waan guddaa miti, duubatti deebi'uu qofa.
Only one then.	Tokko qofa yeroo sana.
We just realized we couldn’t.	Akka hin dandeenye qofa hubanne.
Still no one understood.	Ammas namni hubate hin jiru.
This is not necessary.	Kun hin barbaachisu.
Just as well he's not here.	Akkuma gaarii inni as hin jiru.
It says three hours.	Sa'aatii sadii jedha.
We don’t have the full time.	Yeroo guutuu hin qabnu.
I can't see anything.	Homaa arguu hin danda'u.
We were going to.	Gara deemaa turre.
We need some time.	Yeroo muraasa nu barbaachisa.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
One person	Namni tokko .
You are great, unique.	Ati guddaa, adda.
She doesn't need it.	Ishee hin barbaachisu.
I said I should buy one.	Tokko bitachuu qaba jedheen.
You know what’s out there.	Waan ala jiru beekta.
I know you want kids.	Ijoollee akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
They really don’t need it.	Dhuguma isaan hin barbaachisu.
He wouldn’t have done it.	Silaa hin godhu ture.
He wasn’t easy.	Inni salphaa hin turre.
Everything seems important.	Wanti hundi barbaachisaa fakkaata.
It has a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa qaba.
We walked the road together.	Karaa waliin deemne.
They were better than them.	Isaan caalaa turan.
She doesn’t even have a name.	Maqaa illee hin qabdu.
They didn’t need it.	Isaan hin barbaachifne.
They often think only about themselves.	Yeroo baayyee waa'ee ofii qofa yaadu.
They think we are like them.	Nuti akka isaanii waan taane itti fakkaata.
But it’s all nothing.	Garuu hundi isaa homaa miti.
It was a very dangerous time.	Yeroon sun yeroo baayyee balaa qabu ture.
I'm very happy with it.	Ani baay'een itti gammadeera.
I think the job worked out well for him.	Hojiin sun waan gaarii isaaf hojjete natti fakkaata.
That wasn’t necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa hin turre.
This was extremely good.	Kun garmalee gaarii ture.
This time, it could be more.	Yeroo kana, kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
Like, something about it just doesn't seem real.	Akka, waa'ee isaa wanti tokko qofa dhugaa hin fakkaatu.
He was a stranger, as he thought.	Akkuma yaade nama hin beekne ture.
This, of course, was completely untrue.	Kun, guutummaatti dhugaa kan hin taane akka ture beekamaadha.
I was, some nights.	Ani ture, halkan tokko tokko.
If it sounds too good to be true it probably probably is.	Yoo sagalee isaa baayyee gaarii ta'ee dhugaa ta'uu hin oolu ta'uu hin oolu.
I don’t know what he’s thinking.	Maal akka yaadu hin beeku.
I just don’t do them that way anymore.	Kana booda akkasitti isaan hin godhu qofa.
I am still yours .	Ani ammallee keessan .
It was his eyes.	Ija isaa ture.
I know you have a job.	Hojii akka qabdu nan beeka.
She was absolutely right.	Guutummaatti sirrii turte.
This was a great thing.	Kun waan guddaa ture.
It would be the worst thing we could do.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hunda caalaa hamaa taʼa.
You have to do this.	Kana gochuu qabda.
Time goes really quickly.	Yeroon dhuguma dafee deema.
Certainly, he was.	Mirkanaa'aa dha, inni ture.
You don’t like that one.	Isa sana hin jaallattu.
She keeps her eyes on me.	Ija ishee natti qabdi.
Nothing seems out of place.	Wanti bakka hin qabne fakkaatu hin jiru.
And it was the same thing again.	Ammas kanuma ture.
I need you to know something.	Waan tokko akka beektu si barbaachisa.
Wait here for it.	Asitti eegaa.
I couldn’t eat it.	Nyaachuu hin dandeenye.
I thought it went pretty well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme jedheen yaade.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
He can see too much.	Garmalee arguu danda'a.
Why are you different.	Maaliif adda taate.
I think we have a great opportunity here.	Asitti carraa guddaa qabna jedheen yaada.
Clearly, they have.	Akka qaban ifaadha.
I don’t want to admit he’s wrong.	Dogoggora akka qabu amanuu hin barbaadu.
Nothing from the wife.	Haadha manaa irraa homaa hin jiru.
Screaming and screaming.	Iyyuu fi iyyuu.
I need you to do something.	Waan tokko akka gootu na barbaachisa.
I have been working there.	Achitti hojjechaa tureera.
But we did it.	Garuu hojjenne.
There was only one person there who could be him.	Achitti nama isa ta'uu danda'u tokko qofa ture.
This was all he needed.	Kun waan isa barbaachisu qofa ture.
What a guy.	Maal gurbaa.
I want to play this time.	Yeroo kana taphachuu barbaada.
That’s not necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa miti.
You know your room.	Kutaa kee ni beekta.
He thought about the question.	Gaaffii sana irratti yaade.
I am here with you.	Si waliin as jira.
I'm not saying it will happen.	Ni ta'a jechuu koo miti.
Everyone in the room knew what needed to happen.	Namni kutaa sana keessa jiru hundi maaltu taʼuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
Maybe it’s just my mom.	Tarii haadha koo qofa.
They were in them.	Isaan keessa turan.
Date.	Guyyaa.
There seemed to be no reason.	Sababni isaa waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
Everyone seems to be.	Namni hundi waan ta'e fakkaata.
That was true, of course.	Sun dhugaa akka ture beekamaadha.
It’s just an extremely dangerous place.	Bakka garmalee balaa qabu qofa.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
But she was leaving a little later.	Garuu xiqqoo booda deemaa turte.
It is not clear why.	Maaliif ifa miti.
I don't know what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
But that's probably out here.	Garuu sun as ala ta'uu hin oolu.
Sometimes too much so.	Yeroo tokko tokko garmalee akkas.
That was one of them.	Sun tokko ture.
Like the school thing.	Akkuma waan mana barumsaa.
I didn’t think anyone else would live here.	Namni biraa as jiraata jedhee hin yaadne.
They are on the day.	Guyyaa irra jiru.
He could do that more often.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas gochuu dandaʼa ture.
The right question.	Gaaffii sirrii ta'e.
It won't happen again.	Ammas hin ta'u.
I wasn't sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But no one told him.	Garuu namni itti hime hin jiru.
He made it look easy out there.	Achi keessaa salphaa akka fakkaatu godhe.
This is a very good car.	Kun konkolaataa baayyee gaarii dha.
I need to go quickly.	Dafee deemuun na barbaachisa.
I wondered where I was going.	Eessa akkan deemu yaade.
We had to do something different.	Waan adda taʼe hojjechuu qabna turre.
That was important.	Sun barbaachisaa ture.
Then they do it again.	Sana booda ammas ni godhu.
Maybe, but not anytime soon.	Tarii, garuu yeroo dhiyootti miti.
Not that it seems to matter.	Dhimma waan qabu fakkaata jechuu miti.
Great job with the place.	Hojii guddaa bakka sanaa wajjin.
I hope that never happens.	Gonkumaa akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
I didn't tell him anything.	Ani homaa itti hin himne.
He knows it’s not good for him.	Isaaf gaarii akka hin taane ni beeka.
That's how it is.	Akkasitti akkas.
You are mine, my daughter.	Ati kan kooti intala koo.
Can't you come back next year?	Bara dhufu deebi'uu hin dandeessu?
So far they seem to be doing great.	Hanga ammaatti waan guddaa hojjetu fakkaata.
I never wanted to, you know.	Ani gonkumaa hin barbaanne, beekta.
But you did it.	Garuu ati goote.
I'm not going now.	Amma hin deemu.
I will do whatever it takes.	Waan barbaachisu hunda nan godha.
He is in here.	Inni as keessa jira.
Again, nothing of the same problem.	Ammas rakkoo wal fakkaatu homaa hin jiru.
Everyone told him but he didn’t know there was a problem.	Namni hundi itti hime malee rakkoon akka jiru hin beeku.
This sometimes works better than others.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko yeroo biraa caalaa hojjeta.
I still do it often.	Ammallee yeroo baayʼee nan godha.
I want to work for you.	Siif hojjechuu barbaada.
Some work that is.	Hojii tokko tokko jechuun.
The problem was he was right.	Rakkoon ture inni sirrii ture.
I said one of us has to do something.	Tokko keenya waan tokko gochuu qaba jedheen.
No one has it.	Namni tokkollee hin qabu.
But he really was that person.	Garuu dhuguma nama sana ture.
But it’s not their job.	Garuu hojii isaanii miti.
We don't think that's right.	Sun sirrii nutti hin fakkaatu.
If you ever do it.	Yoom iyyuu yoo goote.
Opportunity was all she needed.	Carraan waan isheen barbaaddu qofa ture.
What they do to people.	Waan nama irratti godhu.
Of course, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It just becomes too much of a good thing.	Waan gaarii garmalee ta'a qofa.
Work.	Hojii.
But there is more to it.	Kana caalaa garuu jira.
Tell him later.	Booda itti himi.
I may be with you this afternoon.	Har'a waaree booda si waliin ta'uu danda'a.
I really hope it works out well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
He knows you.	Inni si beeka.
This time she was absolutely right.	Yeroo kana guutummaatti sirrii turte.
I like that part.	Kutaa sana natti tola.
Let me do it.	Mee akkan godhu.
That should help a lot.	Sun baayyee gargaaruu qaba.
That's why they say.	Kanaaf jedhu.
It could have been a great job for him.	Silaa isaaf hojii guddaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
We can know nothing about her.	Waa'ee ishee homaa beekuu hin dandeenyu.
I have no problem with them.	Ani isaan waliin rakkoo hin qabu.
You don’t have to do what you don’t want to do.	Waan hin barbaanne gochuun dirqama miti.
I mean, never.	Gonkumaa jechuu kooti.
I knew she would.	Akka isheen gootu nan beeka ture.
Maybe it's just not happening soon enough.	Tarii akka dafee hin taane qofa ta'a.
Tell him about it.	Itti himi.
It looks like a lot.	Baayyee fakkaata.
You know you will.	Akka gootu beekta.
That can't last.	Sun turuu hin danda'u.
But it was his mistake.	Garuu dogoggora isaa ture.
I don’t want you to leave.	Akka ati deemtu hin barbaadu.
But now he has nothing.	Garuu amma homaa hin qabu.
I still don't know anything.	Ammas homaa hin beeku.
We were in a lot of trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa turre.
You all know him, he just wants to play.	Hundi keessan isa beektu, inni taphachuu qofa barbaada.
I wasn’t there.	Ani achi hin turre.
I hope someone can help me.	Namni tokko na gargaaruu akka danda'u abdiin qaba.
He stared for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ija keessa ilaale.
You can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
It's been good.	Gaarii ta'ee jira.
I know the right guy.	Gurbaa sirrii ta'e nan beeka.
Reasonable, however, does not mean right.	Sababa kan qabu garuu sirrii jechuu miti.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
What happened tonight will happen.	Wanti halkan kana ta'e ni ta'a.
You are all great.	Hundi keessan guddaa dha.
But sometimes.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko.
But no one there knows him.	Achitti garuu namni isa beeku hin jiru.
But no one does everything.	Garuu namni waan hunda hojjetu hin jiru.
But he knew little about it.	Garuu waa'ee kanaa waan xiqqoo beeku ture.
There was only one.	Tokko qofa ture.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
You were absolutely right.	Ati guutummaatti sirrii turte.
He should still be here.	Ammas as jiraachuu qaba.
I didn’t do it.	Ani hin goone.
I wish things were different.	Osoo wanti adda ta'ee natti tola.
Someone was out there.	Namni tokko achi ala ture.
He came alone.	Inni kophaa isaa dhufe.
There is nothing there for us.	Achitti wanti nuuf ta'u hin jiru.
So you don't know if this even works.	Kanaaf kun illee ni hojjeta moo hin beektu.
None of them worked.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
Not that month.	Ji'a sana miti.
Sorry, but .	Dhiifama, garuu .
I met her eyes for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ija ishee waliin wal arge.
It seemed right at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan sirrii fakkaata ture.
But, that won't be enough.	Garuu, sun gahaa hin ta'u.
I think that's about it.	Waa'ee isaa kanuma jedheen yaada.
There wasn’t one.	Tokkollee hin turre.
But obviously, it’s not true.	Garuu ifaadha, dhugaa akka hin taane.
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
He was doing something else.	Waan biraa hojjechaa ture.
This is working fine.	Kun gaarii hojjechaa jira.
We don't need much.	Waan baay'ee nu hin barbaachisu.
She was doing a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjechaa turte.
I love him very, very much.	Baay'ee baay'een isa jaalladha.
She has to stay home most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee mana turuu qabdi.
Like none of it is true.	Akkuma tokkollee dhugaa hin taane.
Things would be great.	Silaa wanti guddaa ta'a.
So I won't be in that. 	Kanaaf sana keessa hin ta'u. 
It wasn’t my favorite.	Kan ani jaalladhu hin turre.
I could be wrong on that.	Sana irratti dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
It was what they needed.	Waan isaan barbaachisu ture.
You don’t care about these people.	Namoota kanaaf dhimma hin qabdu.
Everyone wants to know about it.	Namni hundi waa'ee isaa beekuu barbaada.
That always works for me.	Sun yeroo hundumaa naaf hojjeta.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
I have been here.	Ani as tureera.
I knew this feeling.	Miira kana nan beeka ture.
He did it perfectly.	Inni guutummaatti ni godhe.
Anyone else have any other ideas?.	Namni biraa yaada biraa qabu jiraa?.
Maybe he's right.	Tarii sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
I think we did that.	Akkas goone natti fakkaata.
I almost didn't see it.	Hin argine jechuun ni danda'ama.
One of his favorite people.	Namoota baay'ee jaallatu keessaa tokko.
He wondered what that thing had done to you.	Wanti sun maal si godhe jedhee yaade.
We need genuine desire.	Fedhii dhugaa nu barbaachisa.
Maybe we should go.	Tarii deemuu qabna.
Lots of cars.	Konkolaataa baay'ee.
But he didn’t, he never could.	Garuu hin goone, gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
He says you are not in your right place.	Bakka kee sirrii hin jirtu jedha.
A lot of that here.	Sana baay'ee asitti.
No luck finding anything there.	Carraa tokkollee achitti waan tokko argachuu hin dandeenye.
In this case she is wrong.	Haala kana keessatti isheen dogoggora.
I'm happy today.	Har'a gammadeera.
Two things.	Maal lama.
I don't know why, exactly.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku, sirriitti.
There was no other opportunity.	Carraan biraa hin turre.
I doubt it will be a good thing.	Waan gaarii akka ta'u nan shakka.
But something else was wrong.	Garuu wanti biraa dogoggora ture.
Then that hand in his car.	Sana booda harka sana konkolaataa isaa keessa.
He was once someone else.	Yeroo tokko nama biraa ture.
It must be there.	Achitti ta'uu qaba.
I would have rather not gone.	Osoo hin deemne naaf wayya ture.
He was there all day.	Guyyaa guutuu achi ture.
But she has a problem.	Garuu rakkoo qabdi.
It doesn’t have a name.	Maqaa hin qabu.
It would happen for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ta'a ture.
But he couldn't go back.	Garuu duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
There was always someone in the room with him.	Yeroo hundumaa namni tokko kutaa sana keessa isa waliin ture.
I like the danger.	Balaa jiru natti tola.
It’s always the guy part of me that has to do something.	Yeroo hunda waan tokko gochuu kan qabu kutaa gurbaa kooti.
It's probably better that way.	Akkasitti wayya ta'uu hin oolu.
He's doing his best.	Waan danda'u hunda hojjechaa jira.
I don't know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
But it’s not mine.	Garuu kan koo miti.
Not too big of a deal.	Baay'ee guddaa miti.
Such a great man.	Nama guddaa akkasii.
I want to go back.	Deebi'uu barbaada.
You would know them.	Silaa isaan beekta.
We have to go tonight.	Halkan kana deemuu qabna.
You are definitely lucky.	Carraa akka qabdu beekamaadha.
He made it work.	Inni akka hojjetu godhe.
She doesn’t need help.	Gargaarsa hin barbaaddu.
There’s someone there who wants to talk to you.	Achitti namni sitti dubbachuu barbaadu jira.
A week later.	Torban tokko booda.
But none as great as him.	Garuu akka isaa guddaa tokkollee hin jiru.
But this may not be enough.	Garuu kun gahaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Maybe we had it.	Tarii qabna turre.
No one had anything to say.	Namni waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
Who was she? 	Isheen eenyu turte?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I know that he knows.	Inni akka beeku nan beeka.
Except that it wasn’t.	Akka hin turre malee.
I didn't want to tell him.	Ani itti himuu hin barbaanne.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
There must be a lot of them out there.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee achi keessa jiraachuu qaba.
In this case it does not exist.	Haala kana keessatti hin jiru.
That was way and way bad.	Sun karaa fi karaa hamaa ture.
She wasn’t kidding.	Isheen qoosaa hin turre.
I know that exactly.	Sana sirriitti beeka.
Maybe it would have been better not to.	Tarii osoo hin taane gaarii ture ta'a.
Not quite enough.	Baay'ee gahaa miti.
It goes well.	Akka gaariitti deema.
Look closely at your work.	Hojii keessan sirriitti ilaalaa.
But this time things were a little different.	Yeroo kana garuu wanti xiqqoo adda ture.
There should have been more.	Silaa kana caalaa jiraachuu qaba ture.
We really had it both ways.	Dhuguma karaa lamaan qabna turre.
No one saw her.	Namni ishee arge hin jiru.
We shouldn’t be doing this.	Kana gochaa jiraachuu hin qabnu.
It seems to them.	Isaan fakkaata.
We have to give up.	Harka kennuu qabna.
They would never have qualified otherwise.	Silaa osoo akkas ta'ee gonkumaa ga'umsa hin qaban turan.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
Which they didn’t.	Kan isaan hin goone.
I don’t know, I don’t want to know.	Ani hin beeku, beekuu hin barbaadu.
We were doing a lot of good things.	Waan gaarii hedduu hojjechaa turre.
Not you, obviously.	Ati miti, ifaadha.
I had none of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I couldn’t even get that right.	Sana sirriitti illee argachuu hin dandeenye.
This is nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa miti.
It was still there though, lucky me.	Ammas achi ture garuu, carraa koo.
Just seeing, not speaking.	Dubbachuu osoo hin taane arguu qofa.
She seems to want more.	Kana caalaa waan barbaaddu fakkaata.
He was just doing what he had to do.	Inni waan gochuu qabu qofa hojjechaa ture.
She was very good.	Isheen baay'ee gaarii turte.
Stay tuned for us.	Nu eegaa.
Same idea, really.	Yaada wal fakkaatu, dhuguma.
You really can.	Dhuguma ni dandeessa.
I should never have come to this.	Silaa gonkumaa gara kanaa dhufuu hin qabu ture.
He wasn’t in it.	Inni keessa hin turre.
Except, this time, it wasn’t.	Malee, yeroo kana, hin turre.
But afterwards.	Garuu booda.
It happens, of course.	Ni ta'a, beekamaadha.
He didn't say who knew.	Kan beeku hin dubbanne.
That worked well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjete.
It’s like she knows him.	Akka waan isheen isa beektu fakkaata.
There is a lot of work to do this morning.	Ganama kana hojiin baay'een jira.
I thought you would love it.	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaade.
He didn’t do his own.	Kan isaa hin goone.
Nothing had happened.	Homaa ta'e hin turre.
Why they have everyone after me.	Maaliif nama hunda na booda qaban.
No one else was there at all, just us.	Namni biraa tasumaa achi hin turre, nu qofa.
With my people.	Namoota koo waliin.
Mostly we are hopeful.	Irra caalaa abdii qabna.
Now, that seemed very real.	Amma, sun baay’ee dhugaa fakkaata ture.
There is nothing there.	Achitti wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
As she was.	Akkuma turte.
It was exactly right.	Sirriitti sirrii ture.
He always had it.	Yeroo hundumaa qaba ture.
I had to make this happen.	Kana akka ta'u gochuun qaba ture.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
But I wouldn't say it, I can't say it.	Garuu hin jedhu ture, jechuu hin danda'u.
Maybe it's a dog.	Tarii saree ta'uu danda'a.
How it looked afterwards.	Booda akkamitti fakkaata ture.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
That can't be true!	Sun dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u!
You should have seen him.	Silaa isa arguu qabda turte.
I can't tell you much.	Waan baay'ee sitti himuu hin danda'u.
They were sure.	Isaan mirkanaa'aa turan.
They want to ask me questions.	Gaaffii na gaafachuu barbaadu.
That will probably be enough.	Kun gahaa taʼuu hin oolu.
Going to do more of what you love.	Waan jaallattu caalaa hojjechuuf deemuu.
I couldn’t see anyone.	Nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
They’re all really good friends.	Hundi isaanii dhuguma hiriyyoota gaarii dha.
But then again, who knows.	Garuu sana booda ammas eenyutu beeka.
This time things were going to be different.	Yeroo kana wanti adda ta'uuf ture.
He didn’t want his money.	Maallaqa isaa hin barbaanne.
The reason became clear.	Sababni isaa ifa ta’e.
But then he spoke again.	Sana booda garuu ammas dubbate.
It's not about the name.	Waa'ee maqaa miti.
You are everywhere.	Bakka hunda jirta.
It’s probably important to say.	Jechuun barbaachisaa ta’uu hin oolu.
I know it’s in there.	Achi keessa akka jiru nan beeka.
Maybe it's new.	Tarii haaraa ta'uu danda'a.
I certainly wasn’t.	Ani akkan hin turre beekamaadha.
I never tell mine.	Kan kootti gonkumaa hin himu.
But only so far.	Garuu hanga ammaatti qofa.
I didn’t want to make the same mistake again.	Ammas dogoggora wal fakkaatu hojjechuu hin barbaanne.
If we ever do it.	Yoom iyyuu yoo goone.
It could have been.	Silaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
He wanted to have us.	Nu qabaachuu barbaade.
He knows perfectly well what he’s doing.	Waan hojjetu guutummaatti sirriitti beeka.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	Yeroo sanatti yaada gaarii natti fakkaate.
Stay tuned and check it out here.	Nu eegaa as ilaalaa.
We’re just different.	Nuti adda qofa.
That's exactly what happens.	Kan ta'u sirriitti kanuma.
Which, to be clear, wasn’t my intention.	Kan, ifa ta’uuf, yaada koo hin turre.
No one said much.	Namni baay'ee dubbate hin jiru.
The man came again that night.	Namni sun halkan sana ammas dhufe.
I didn’t see anyone else.	Nama biraa hin argine.
Not very easy before.	Duraan baayyee salphaa miti.
So it never worked for me.	Kanaaf gonkumaa naaf hin hojjenne.
You may have to stay home then .	Yeroo sanatti mana turuu qabda ta'a .
She hadn't wanted to give him away.	Isheen isa kennuu hin barbaanne turte.
He hadn’t gone away.	Inni hin deemne ture.
She still held it up.	Ammallee ol qabdi turte.
A long and vital life.	Jireenya dheeraa fi barbaachisaa ta’e.
I can definitely see that.	Sana arguu akkan danda'u beekamaadha.
That's what it was supposed to be.	Kanuma ta'uu qaba ture.
It couldn't have mattered.	Dhimma qabaachuu hin danda'u ture.
You have to be different.	Adda ta'uu qabda.
I have pictures with a lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee waliin suuraa qaba.
What they really needed was truth and hope.	Wanti dhuguma isaan barbaachisu dhugaa fi abdii ture.
I had no idea what would happen.	Waan ta'u yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It wasn’t the right place.	Bakka sirrii hin turre.
I wanted them on mine more than anything.	Waan hundumaa caalaa kan koo irratti isaan barbaade.
It wasn’t a good environment.	Naannoo gaarii hin turre.
This is obviously incorrect.	Kun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
Perhaps that is the problem.	Tarii rakkoon sun kanuma taʼuu dandaʼa.
He never should have done it, of course.	Silaa gonkumaa gochuu hin qabu ture, beekamaadha.
Two months ago it was pretty big.	Ji'a lama dura baayyee guddaa ture.
Like, really sorry.	Akka, dhuguma dhiifama.
It wasn’t a good environment.	Naannoo gaarii hin turre.
She looks a lot like his daughter.	Baayyee intala isaa fakkaata.
That is no longer true.	Kana booda sun dhugaa miti.
I still have no chance.	Ammas carraa hin qabu.
Good luck.	Carraa gaarii.
She didn’t see his issue.	Isheen dhimma isaa hin argine.
If he couldn't have her.	Osoo ishee qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
I can do that better than him .	Ani isa caalaa sana gochuu nan danda'a .
That's nothing.	Sun homaa miti.
It doesn’t go away completely.	Guutummaatti hin deemu.
He went, he went.	Deeme, deeme.
He obviously doesn’t know much about children.	Waa’ee ijoollee baay’ee akka hin beekne ifaadha.
Do you have any ideas ?.	Yaada qabduu ?.
Looks really good on him.	Dhuguma gaarii fakkaata isa irratti.
They’re just looking at you.	Si qofa ilaalaa jiru.
He was good at what he did.	Waan hojjetu irratti ga'umsa qaba ture.
There were a lot of people there.	Namoonni baay'een achi turan.
You must come back with me.	Ana waliin deebi'uu qabda.
Very few people know this.	Kana kan beeku namoonni baayyee muraasa.
He still didn’t have the path he wanted.	Ammallee karaa barbaade hin qabu ture.
He is very good at what he does.	Waan hojjetu irratti baay'ee ga'umsa qaba.
Otherwise, there was nothing special about you.	Yoo kana hin taane, waa'ee kee wanti adda ta'e hin turre.
I want to work on it.	Irratti hojjechuu barbaada.
I know how he thinks.	Akkamitti akka yaadu nan beeka.
Look there!	Achi ilaalaa!
But there are definitely problems.	Garuu rakkoon akka jiru beekamaadha.
I think it worked well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete natti fakkaata.
Your problem must be something else.	Rakkoon kee waan biraa ta'uu qaba.
It seemed like the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ta'e fakkaata ture.
He wasn’t looking at the road.	Karaa ilaalaa hin turre.
There is no reason why they should.	Sababni isaan qaban hin jiru.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
But I had to have it.	Ani garuu qabaachuu qaba ture.
He must do this.	Kana gochuu qaba.
You know how you can.	Akkamitti akka dandeessu beekta.
And it was still.	Ammas ture.
I told him it was nothing.	Homaa akka hin taane itti hime.
Like her life, he thought.	Akkuma jireenya ishee jedhee yaade.
This was his great opportunity.	Kun carraa guddaa isaa ture.
Now they know.	Amma beeku.
Everything in your life will be fresh and new.	Jireenya kee keessatti wanti hundi haaraa fi haaraa ta'a.
It can go further.	Kana caalaa deemuu danda’a.
Nobody wanted to play.	Namni taphachuu barbaadu hin turre.
He did not want to comment.	Yaada kennuu hin barbaanne.
I wasn't so sure about it.	Waa'ee isaa hangas mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
He is currently in critical condition.	Yeroo ammaa kana haala hamaa keessa jira.
He went tonight.	Halkan kana deeme.
That's nothing.	Sun homaa miti.
They should not ask questions.	Gaaffii gaafachuu hin qaban.
That’s better for you.	Sun siif wayya.
Not enough good people.	Namoota gaarii gahaa miti.
What he did was right.	Wanti inni godhe sirrii ture.
I don't know her.	Ani ishee hin beeku.
You have to be different.	Adda ta'uu qabda.
But they weren’t new.	Garuu isaan haaraa hin turre.
In some cases this may be appropriate.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti kun sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
He was quick.	Inni dafee ture.
She didn’t have many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu hin qabdu turte.
They don’t have .	Isaan hin qaban .
I had to make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuun qaba ture.
They waited helplessly.	Gargaarsa malee eegaa turan.
In this case he was right.	Haala kana keessatti sirrii ture.
Now it seemed not so.	Amma akkas waan hin taane fakkaata ture.
No two ways about that.	Waa'ee sanaa karaa lama hin jiru.
But, it doesn’t work for me.	Garuu, naaf hin hojjetu.
He did everything.	Waan hundumaa hojjete.
We need it to do this.	Kana hojjechuuf nu barbaachisa.
It would have been.	Silaa.
Few, not many.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane muraasa.
They don’t care enough.	Isaan dhimma gahaa hin qaban.
It was a good time.	Yeroon sun yeroo gaarii ture.
We had to find you.	Si argachuu qabna turre.
It's a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu isaa.
We need answers.	Deebii nu barbaachisa.
That's how you should do it.	Akkasitti gochuu qabda.
For you, it’s perfectly clear.	Siif, guutummaatti ifaadha.
, which is in the state of .	, kan haala keessa jiru .
She doesn’t care in that room.	Kutaa sana keessatti dhimma hin qabdu.
I never want to see them again.	Gonkumaa kana booda isaan arguu hin barbaadu.
Now I would never know.	Amma gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
Time didn't seem like anything was happening.	Yeroon wanti ta'aa jiru hin fakkaatu ture.
More in it.	Isa keessa caalaa.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
She certainly couldn’t see me.	Isheen na arguu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
That was pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii ture.
But you are mine.	Ati garuu kan kooti.
We have a lot of good things.	Waan gaarii hedduu qabna.
He wouldn't go, of course.	Hin deemu ture, beekamaadha.
Now, someone had.	Amma, namni tokko qaba ture.
This is the task at hand.	Hojiin harka jiru kana.
He became a great teacher.	Barsiisaa guddaa ta'e.
I am nothing now.	Ani amma homaa miti.
Many of them were very new at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baay'een isaanii baay'ee haaraa turan.
I don't understand the question.	Gaaffii naaf hin galle.
They know themselves.	Of beeku.
It must be the right one.	Kan sirrii ta'uu qaba.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
He was very happy.	Baay'ee gammade.
They are waiting for their man.	Nama isaanii eegaa jiru.
He doesn’t do anything.	Inni homaa hin hojjetu.
Which is not a good thing.	Kan waan gaarii hin taane.
He understood me.	Inni na hubate.
We have to go somewhere.	Bakka tokko deemuu qabna.
He had to tell her.	Itti himuu qaba ture.
Soon, it will be.	Yeroo dhiyootti, ni ta'a.
I didn't know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture.
There was just never the right time.	Yeroon sirrii ta'e gonkumaa hin turre qofa.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
One just has to be lucky.	Namni carraa qabaachuu qofa qaba.
She is so nice.	Isheen akkasitti namatti tola.
I thought he was so lucky.	Akkas carraa qaba jedheen yaade.
I often seemed to know just what was needed.	Yeroo baayʼee wanta barbaachisu qofa waanan beeku natti fakkaata ture.
He wasn’t good enough.	Inni gaarii hin turre.
But it was really more like that.	Garuu dhuguma caalaatti akkas ture.
There were two.	Lama ture.
I just didn’t see them.	Isaan hin argine qofa.
It has a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa qaba.
So glad to see you!	Si arguu kootti baay'ee gammade!
How much, we don’t know yet.	Meeqa, hanga ammaatti hin beekne.
He looked at this one.	Isa kana ilaale.
But they shouldn’t have it.	Garuu qabaachuu hin qaban.
But it’s not a dog.	Garuu saree miti.
He wasn’t in a funny mood.	Miira qoosaa keessa hin turre.
He is not a good man.	Nama gaarii miti.
That’s my daughter.	Sun intala kooti.
I doubt anyone would.	Namni akka godhu nan shakka.
I shouldn't know what's going on here.	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru beekuu hin qabu.
Then everything works.	Sana booda wanti hundi ni hojjeta.
We are human beings.	Nuti nama dha.
We only had one thing.	Waan tokko qofa qabna turre.
Maybe she still has it.	Tarii ammallee ni qabdi ta'a.
But I couldn’t see anything.	Garuu homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
Like a human being.	Akka nama.
It works really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
He had something to think about.	Waan yaadu qaba ture.
Just love me.	Na jaalladhu qofa.
There was only one.	Tokko qofa ture.
Get the best out of your food.	Nyaata keessan irraa waan gaarii argachuu.
He didn't understand.	Hin hubanne ture.
This can be serious.	Kun hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
So I need an answer.	Kanaaf deebii barbaada.
But still, it didn’t matter.	Garuu ammas, homaa hin turre.
She was right, of course.	Isheen sirrii akka turte beekamaadha.
You're not going.	Ati hin deemtu.
They might want you later.	Booda si barbaadu ta'a.
This may not be the case.	Kun taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I can't see anyone in here.	As keessa nama tokkollee arguu hin danda'u.
I want that right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sana barbaada.
I don't think anything else.	Ani waan biraa natti hin fakkaatu.
The one with the cat.	Kan saree qabu.
I couldn’t believe my eyes.	Ija koo amanuu hin dandeenye.
It was clear he had more to say.	Kana caalaa waan jedhu akka qabu ifa ture.
He didn't seem to have it.	Kan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
That may not be the case for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
It's not perfect, just to be clear.	Inni guutuu miti, ifa ta'uuf qofa.
He didn't want to be a father.	Abbaa ta'uu hin barbaanne.
I knew he knew me, but I couldn’t speak.	Akka na beeku nan beeka ture, garuu dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
He has a good sense of humor about that.	Sana irratti qoosaa gaarii qaba.
I mean, look at the facts.	Dhugaa jiru ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
They are there.	Achi jiru.
We’re kind of on that.	Nuti akkas sana irra jirra.
I have it right here.	Ani sirriitti asitti qaba.
This wasn’t for him.	Kun isaaf hin turre.
A lone man walks down the deserted road.	Namni kophaa isaa jiru tokko karaa namni hin jirre sana irra deema.
It certainly was in our case.	Dhimma keenya irratti akka ture beekamaadha.
That’s how it went.	Akkasitti deeme.
You don't go much this way.	Karaa kanaan baay'ee hin deemtu.
It worked really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjete.
We’re working on something.	Waan tokko irratti hojjechaa jirra.
He has so much more to give.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee kennuu qaba.
He bought new clothes.	Uffata haaraa bite.
She has a wide circle of friends.	Hiriyyoota bal'aa qabdi.
It's almost ridiculous.	Qoosaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
Currently.	Yeroo ammaatti.
He couldn’t believe what he had done.	Waan hojjete amanuu hin dandeenye.
It still shouldn't be perfect.	Ammallee guutuu ta'uu hin qabu.
Little.	Xiqqoo.
I know you can’t help yourself.	Of gargaaruu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka.
What is the cause of this problem?	Sababni rakkoo kanaa maali?
They had to be.	Ta'uu qabu turan.
There's not much you can do.	Waan baay'ee gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
That’s how it worked on the road.	Karaa irratti akkasitti hojjete.
That wasn’t it.	Sun hin turre.
One is new.	Tokko haaraa dha.
It was a good one.	Kan gaarii ture.
Someone came into view.	Namni tokko ija keessa dhufe.
I really enjoyed it.	Dhuguma itti gammadeera.
Which couldn't be.	Kan ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
It is still clear.	Ammallee ifaadha.
He came to the scene.	Inni dhufe.
I know there’s more to it than that.	Kana caalaa akka jiru nan beeka.
It can be a little bit smaller than that.	Sana irraa xiqqoo xiqqoo xiqqoo ta'uu danda'a.
He has eyes.	Ija qaba.
He never did it.	Gonkumaa hin goone.
None of them were willing to help.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee gargaaruuf fedhii hin qabu ture.
It just doesn't come up very often.	Baay'ee hin dhufu qofa.
If it hadn't been there.	Osoo hin turre ta'a.
So he was right.	Kanaaf inni sirrii ture.
All about themselves.	Waa'ee ofii isaanii hunda.
He is in the wrong place at the wrong time.	Yeroo hin taane bakka hin taane jira.
She didn’t know what to do or where to go.	Maal akka gootu fi eessa akka deemtu hin beektu turte.
He has food.	Nyaata qaba.
It shouldn’t have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin qabu.
It was really like that.	Dhuguma akkas ture.
But he has it.	Garuu qaba.
I love him very much.	Ani baay'een isa jaalladha.
Maybe it's a good thing.	Tarii waan gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
I know those people.	Namoota sana nan beeka.
No one does it.	Namni tokkollee hin godhu.
We can’t live.	Jiraachuu hin dandeenyu.
I hadn’t thought about it then.	Yeroo sana itti hin yaadne ture.
On each other.	Wal irratti.
His voice.	Sagalee isaa.
But he wasn't there.	Garuu achi hin turre.
You did it.	Ati goote.
Nothing seemed to work.	Wanti tokkollee waan hin hojjenne fakkaata ture.
It’s good so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii dha.
His chances.	Carraa isaa.
But you better be right about it.	Garuu waa'ee kanaa sirrii ta'uu wayya.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
She doesn’t have any right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana tokkollee hin qabdu.
But not to that extent.	Garuu hanga sanatti miti.
It looks like money.	Maallaqa fakkaata.
As it can be.	Akkuma ta'uu danda'u.
I'll be a human being.	Ani nama ta'a.
Look at that girl over there!	Mee intala achi jirtu sana ilaalaa!
But for good reason.	Garuu sababa gaarii qaba.
I can't go anymore.	Kana booda deemuu hin danda'u.
That was all a long time ago.	Sun hundi yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
I don't tell.	Hin himu.
I think she has a good reason.	Sababa gaarii qabdi jedheen yaada.
No one is sure.	Namni mirkanaa'aa hin jiru.
Very, very big.	Baayyee baayyee guddaa.
It 's all	Hundi isaa .
He knew a great deal.	Waan guddaa beeka ture.
It was really the right opportunity for us.	Dhuguma carraa sirrii ta'e nuuf ta'e.
I know your feelings.	Miira kee nan beeka.
This wasn’t good enough.	Kun gaarii hin turre.
Then it had happened.	Sana booda ta'ee ture.
I wasn't sure it would work.	Akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It was a good thing, he thought.	Waan gaarii ture jedhee yaade.
Very good feeling.	Miira baayyee gaarii.
I can speak.	Dubbachuu nan danda'a.
Sorry if that wasn't clear.	Osoo sun ifa hin taane dhiifama.
Only you can say that.	Kan jechuu danda'u si qofa.
They were looking for them.	Isaan barbaadaa turan.
A car, maybe.	Konkolaataa tokko, tarii.
I want to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuu nan barbaada.
I had no idea what she was saying.	Maal akka isheen jedhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I couldn’t do anything about any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
Like before in her room.	Akkuma kanaan dura kutaa ishee keessa ture.
He did a very good job.	Hojii baayyee gaarii hojjete.
I didn't want to talk about anything more.	Kana caalaa waa'ee homaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
I couldn't tell anyone, I couldn't go back to anyone.	Namatti himuu hin dandeenye, gara namatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
He doesn't know anyone.	Nama inni beeku hin jiru.
I didn't really tell my kids much.	Dhuguma ijoollee kootti waan baay'ee hin himne.
That’s mostly it.	Irra caalaa kanuma.
he told himself.	jedhee ofitti hime.
He had no home life.	Jireenya manaa hin qabu ture.
He's probably right.	Inni sirrii ta'uu hin oolu.
He bought them a watch.	Sa'aatii tokko isaan bite.
Except he didn't.	Hin goone malee.
This was pretty bad.	Kun baayyee hamaa ture.
I obviously did.	Ani akkan godhe ifaadha.
There's a lot going on around here.	Naannoo asitti waan baay'ee ta'aa jira.
We have what we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu qabna.
He got a job.	Hojii argate.
It’s still working.	Ammallee hojjechaa jira.
It doesn't mean it happened.	Ta'e jechuu miti.
No one could help you.	Namni si gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I enjoyed that part.	Kutaa sanatti gammadeera.
Maybe that's what it is.	Tarii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
But, obviously, that is not the case.	Garuu, ifaadha, akkas akka hin taane.
That is not usually the case.	Yeroo baayyee akkas miti.
He is still there.	Ammallee achi jira.
you might say.	jechuu dandeessa.
But it was a lot.	Garuu baay'ee ture.
Now you can do that.	Amma akkas gochuu dandeessa.
I don't want to do anything.	Ani homaa gochuu hin barbaadu.
You would think that.	Silaa jettanii yaaddu.
Simple, but wrong.	Salphaa, garuu dogoggora.
Nothing will ever happen.	Yoomiyyuu wanti ta'u hin jiru.
More than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa.
It goes on and on.	Irratti fi irra deema.
One name I really don’t understand.	Maqaa tokko dhuguma naaf hin galle.
But please.	Garuu maaloo.
It wasn't something he did much of.	Waan inni baay'ee hojjete hin turre.
I am interested in your response to this.	Deebii keessan kanaaf fedhii qaba.
Almost all of them were excellent.	Hundi isaanii jechuun ni danda’ama baay’ee gaarii turan.
Thirty years later she did.	Waggaa 30 booda akkas goote.
I think that .	Akkas jedheen yaada .
They had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qaban turan.
It has pretty much everything you could want.	Waan ati barbaaddu hunda baay'ee qaba.
There was some really good stuff going on.	Waan dhuguma gaarii ta'e tokko tokko deemaa ture.
But not here, and not again.	Garuu asitti miti, ammas miti.
That was a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ture.
One of the big ones.	Guddaa tokko.
Nothing but mistakes.	Dogoggora malee homaa hin jiru.
That's very possible.	Sun baayyee ni danda'ama.
None of them are working.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hojjechaa hin jiru.
At the time, it seems mandatory.	Yeroo sanatti dirqama fakkaata.
Indeed, it will happen.	Dhuguma, ni ta'a.
He will seek for nothing.	Inni homaa malee ni barbaada.
But it’s there.	Garuu achi jira.
You can see a lot of what's new right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana waan haaraa ta'e baay'ee arguu dandeessu.
They come looking.	Isaan ilaalaa dhufu.
This was more than their job.	Kun hojii isaanii caalaa ture.
I don't quite understand this.	Kana sirriitti naaf hin galle.
Not working too much but something.	Baay'ee hojjechuu osoo hin taane waan tokko.
He said you need my help.	Gargaarsa koo si barbaachisa jedhe.
So there you are.	Kanaaf achitti isin.
Soon, very soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti, baayyee dhiyootti.
It was just part of my life.	Kutaa jireenya koo keessaa tokko qofa ture.
I know you way and way.	Karaa fi karaa si beeka.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
No question about that.	Waa'ee sanaa gaaffii hin qabu.
She was in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa turte.
I certainly thought about it many times.	Yeroo baay'ee akkan yaade beekamaadha.
So far it seems to be working.	Hanga ammaatti waan hojjetu fakkaata.
That took some time.	Sun yeroo fudhate.
Then another and another.	Sana booda kan biraa fi kan biraa.
That didn’t last long though.	Sun garuu yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
No one ever does.	Namni gonkumaa godhu hin jiru.
I don't like it.	Ani hin jaalladhu.
Now she was just trying to be nice.	Amma isheen gaarii ta'uuf qofa yaalaa turte.
If you do, you know what you’ve done.	Yoo goote waan goote beekta.
She shouldn't have had any of her own.	Silaa ofii ishee tokkollee qabaachuu hin qabdu turte.
It’s just the truth.	Dhugaa qofa.
He'd be himself again.	Silaa ammas ofii isaa ta'a ture.
It was just one picture.	Suuraa tokko qofa ture.
They look good.	Isaan gaarii fakkaatu.
It goes with the work.	Hojii waliin deema.
That's the one.	Inni sun.
Nobody gave us a chance but we did.	Namni carraa nuuf kenne hin jiru garuu nuti goone.
Just look at me.	Na ilaalaa qofa.
He has something to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu qaba.
But he saw nothing.	Garuu homaa hin argine.
They had time.	Yeroo qaban turan.
I want to tell him what is going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru itti himuu barbaada.
It's just a joke.	Qoosaa qofa.
There is a time.	Yeroon tokko.
He always does it.	Inni yeroo hunda ni godha.
You don't know how much you think.	Hamma yaaddu hin beektu.
You certainly don’t know that.	Kana akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
In this case they were both.	Haala kana keessatti lamaan isaanii turan.
But she did it.	Isheen garuu goote.
I can’t see how this is necessary.	Kun akkamitti akka barbaachisaa ta’e arguu hin danda’u.
I love the sound of it.	Sagalee isaa baay'een jaalladha.
You don’t have to do anything!	Waan tokko gochuun si hin barbaachisu!
I know a lot of people.	Namoota baay'een beeka.
Maybe it didn't happen.	Tarii hin taane ta'a.
I couldn't say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin dandeenye.
This is just one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko qofa.
That’s how you can do this.	Akkasitti kana gochuu dandeessa.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
He never makes a mistake.	Yoomiyyuu dogoggora hin hojjetu.
I really love them too much.	Dhuguma garmalee isaan jaalladha.
They were right.	Isaan sirrii turan.
We are in your hands.	Harka keessan jirra.
Sometimes it’s just not right.	Yeroo tokko tokko sirrii miti qofa.
I like it very much.	Baay'ee natti tola.
They did none of this though.	Isaan kana keessaa tokkollee hin goone garuu.
I don't think I can do this.	Kana gochuu waanan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu.
You can’t keep up with him.	Isa waliin deemuu hin dandeessu.
It was none of his business.	Dhimma isaa tokkollee hin turre.
I think it would be better if no one was there.	Osoo namni hin jirre gaarii natti fakkaata.
I have that.	Ani sana qaba.
We’re not the only ones.	Nu qofa miti.

Previously as .	Duraan akka .

You are not doing all you can do.	Waan gochuu dandeessu hunda hojjechaa hin jirtu.
I was there for a while, just waiting.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi ture, eegaa qofa.
He has no children.	Ijoollee hin qabu.
He was just doing his job.	Hojii isaa qofa hojjechaa ture.
I had no idea it was that bad.	Akkas hamaa ta'uu isaa yaada hin qabu ture.
It just has to be.	Ta'uu qofa qaba.
I can't stay home today.	Har'a mana turuu hin danda'u.
I wasn’t home.	Ani mana hin turre.
I’ve always said that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedheen ture.
I don’t know any of them here.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee asitti hin beeku.

They are mine.	Isaan kan kooti.
But yet it still exists.	Garuu ammas ammallee jira.
That’s it, really.	Kanuma, dhuguma.
Hours, he thought.	Sa'aatii, jedhee yaade.
Language is the language.	Afaan jechuun afaan.

He wasn’t looking at her.	Ishee ilaalaa hin turre.
You know that, but you don’t know any good.	Ati kana beekta, garuu waan gaarii hin beektu.
I hadn’t made any mistakes.	Dogoggora tokkollee hin hojjenne ture.
I don’t want you here.	Asitti si hin barbaadu.
He took the question.	Gaaffii fudhate.
Now it was mine.	Amma kan koo ture.
He thought it wouldn't help.	Hin gargaaru jedhee yaade.
It is not enough to say.	Jechuun gahaa miti.
Not even for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf illee miti.
A really great watch!.	Sa'aatii dhuguma guddaa!.
Good thing, obviously.	Waan gaarii, ifa ta'e.
It seemed a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura fakkaata ture.
We are expecting great people.	Namoota guddaa eegaa jirra.
He was obviously looking at one now.	Amma tokko ilaalaa akka ture ifaadha.
All the best!.	Gaarii hunda!.
It can go a little longer.	Xiqqoo dheeraa deemuu danda'a.
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
I wish, sometimes, it was different.	Osoo, yeroo tokko tokko, adda ta'ee natti tola.
They go everywhere.	Bakka hunda deemu.
He had a lot to say.	Waan hedduu jedhu qaba ture.
They were just trying to help.	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa turan.
It’s really just not my thing.	Dhuguma waan koo qofa miti.
You are in for a very, very long night.	Halkan baayyee baayyee dheeraa keessa jirta.
One day it was nothing but truth.	Guyyaa tokko dhugaa malee homaa hin taane.
I would love your feedback.	Yaada keessan baay'een jaalladha.
He’s a little lonely, you know.	Inni xiqqoo kophaa isaa jiraata, beekta.
We have two other children.	Ijoollee lama kan biraa qabna.
But that is not the case now.	Garuu amma akkas miti.
No one knew exactly what was going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru namni sirriitti beeku hin turre.
Maybe he can.	Tarii ni danda'a ta'a.
Not for long now.	Amma yeroo dheeraaf miti.
Next week will be different.	Torban dhufu adda ta'a.
If not, it probably won’t work for you.	Yoo hin taane tarii siif hin hojjetu.
He knows you.	Inni si beeka.
They should have seen it.	Silaa arguu qabu turan.
They tell us.	Nutti himu.
Everyone has to go.	Hundi deemuu qaba.

But it was there.	Garuu achi ture.
Round and round they went, time after time.	Naannoo fi naannoo deemaa turan, yeroo yeroon.
Only you understood this before.	Kana dura kan hubate si qofa.
Except he didn’t go that night.	Halkan sana hin deemne malee.
You may feel completely different.	Miira guutummaatti adda taʼe qabaachuu dandeessa.
Now, things are different.	Amma, wanti jiru adda adda.
Glad to have her there.	Achitti ishee argachuu kootti gammadeera.
They were good, but not that good.	Isaan gaarii turan, garuu hangas gaarii hin turre.
I highly doubt this fact.	Dhugaa kana baay'een shakka.
It wasn’t an idea he had.	Yaada isa bira jiru hin turre.
I'm pretty sure he didn't.	Akkas akka hin goone baay'een mirkanaa'adha.
It’s not really here.	Dhuguma as hin jiru.
He is doing well.	Inni waan gaarii hojjechaa jira.
It happens often.	Yeroo baay’ee ni ta’a.
There were people on the road.	Karaa irra namoonni turan.
He says it's very good.	Baayyee gaarii jedha.
He knew this place.	Bakka kana ni beeka ture.
I don't want to have to.	Dirqama ta'uu hin barbaadu.
You are very good to us.	Ati baay'ee nuuf gaarii dha.
You can get him from that.	Sana irraa isa argachuu dandeessa.
She had no issues before.	Kanaan dura dhimma hin qabdu turte.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
Looking for a place soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti bakka barbaada.
He seemed to have watched.	Kan ilaale fakkaata ture.
That's a very, very good question.	Sun gaaffii baayyee gaarii, baayyee gaarii dha.
We have to be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu qabna.
That was one thing.	Sun waan tokko ture.
They could get that.	Sana argachuu dandaʼu turan.
He did exactly what he had to do.	Waan gochuu qabu sirriitti hojjete.
But we cannot stay in this situation.	Garuu haala kana keessa turuu hin dandeenyu.
Living around it and .	Naannoo isaa jiraachuu fi .
You don't have to talk about negative things.	Waa'ee waan hamaa dubbachuu hin qabdu.
I thought he was going to do this.	Kana gochuuf deemu natti fakkaate.
He didn't say more for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf kana caalaa hin jedhe.
It was clear at night.	Halkan ifa ture.
I am not interested in such questions.	Gaaffii akkasii kanaaf fedhii hin qabu.

Always exactly three.	Yeroo hundumaa sirriitti sadii.
We need to do something about that.	Sana irratti waan tokko gochuu qabna.
Anyone have any questions?	Namni gaaffii qabu jiraa?
But this is not the case here.	Garuu asitti kun akkas miti.
You have to do those things.	Wantoota sana hojjechuu qabda.
Now he was inside me.	Amma inni na keessa ture.
How many children do you have?	Ijoollee meeqa qabda?
What else could it be.	Kan biraa maal ta'uu danda'a.
He was right, of course.	Inni sirrii akka ture beekamaadha.
And now everyone knows.	Ammas namni hundi ni beeka.
They may be.	Ta'uu danda'u.
He must see it.	Arguu qaba.
I couldn't have helped it.	Silaa gargaaruu hin danda'u ture.
This can never be right.	Kun gonkumaa sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u.
It seemed like a year ago.	Bara tokko dura fakkaata ture.
Hope it helps someone.	Nama akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
He is on his way here now.	Amma asitti karaa irra jira.
But it didn’t quite work.	Garuu sirriitti hin hojjenne.
Current.	Yeroo ammaa.
We have a lot of the same feelings.	Miira wal fakkaatu baay'ee qabna.
It’s just a matter of fact.	Dhimma dhugaa qofa.
That's very dangerous.	Sun baayyee balaa qaba.
At the time that was really extreme.	Yeroo sanatti sun dhuguma garmalee ture.
But even this is not right.	Garuu kun illee sirrii miti.
This was supposed to be her season.	Kun bara ishee ta'uu qaba ture.
It was a good night.	Halkan gaarii ture.
I can't do anything good here.	Asitti waan gaarii tokkollee hojjechuu hin danda'u.
Good things in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti waan gaarii.
It’s on now.	Amma irra jira.
I have my reasons.	Sababa koo qaba.
I am totally into it.	Ani guutummaatti keessa jira.
I'll say you said that.	Akkas jette nan jedha.
I couldn’t tell him what to do.	Waan godhu itti himuu hin dandeenye.
And yet it happened.	Ammas ta'ee.
I think we still have that.	Ammallee sana qabna jedheen yaada.
It doesn’t always work.	Yeroo hunda hin hojjetu.
You know best.	Ati hunda caalaa beekta.
And yet, it’s pretty much the same.	Ammas ta’ee, baay’ee wal fakkaata.
But something has to happen.	Garuu wanti tokko ta'uu qaba.
This, of course, is certainly not the case here.	Kun, beekamaadha, asitti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I think it's true.	Dhugaa natti fakkaata.
I had no idea why, but that didn't matter.	Maaliif akka taʼe yaada hin qabu ture, garuu sun homaa hin qabu ture.
But of course not.	Garuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I never knew what made him, exactly.	Maaltu akka isa godhe gonkumaa hin beeku, sirriitti.
Perhaps something similar happens here.	Tarii asitti wanti wal fakkaatu taʼuu dandaʼa.
Long, long past.	Dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa darbe.
Many and one.	Hedduu fi tokko.
He was a bit unlike you.	Xiqqoo akka kee hin turre.
That was good, but still not enough.	Sun gaarii ture, garuu ammas gahaa hin turre.
Nobody does, really.	Namni hin godhu, dhuguma.
He knew the area well.	Naannoo sana sirriitti beeka ture.
How old is this?.	Kun bara meeqa?.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
We can’t really do any better.	Dhuguma kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
But you have to be lucky.	Garuu carraa qabaachuu qabda.
I think he was looking for a book.	Kitaaba barbaadaa ture natti fakkaata.
Like, really love it.	Akka, dhuguma jaalladhu.
To do that.	Sana gochuuf.
So far, so good.	Hanga ammaatti, akkas gaarii.
It would have worked just fine.	Silaa gaarii ta'ee hojjeta ture.
I could not find the error.	Dogoggora sana argachuu hin dandeenye.
But little else.	Garuu waan biraa xiqqoo.
Then this, then that.	Sana booda kana, sana booda sana.
Is there anything else? 	Kan biraa jiraa?
She didn’t do that.	Isheen akkas hin goone.
Where he wasn't sure.	Bakka inni mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
At the same time.	Kanuma waliin.
It was very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa ture.
That's how we talked.	Akkasitti dubbanne.
She said she could.	Ni dandeessa jette.
Not a whole lot but a few.	Baay'ee guutuu osoo hin taane muraasa.
So that’s what this is.	Kanaaf kun kanuma.
That's how it might be.	Akkas ta'uu danda'a.
I can do something for you.	Waan tokko siif gochuu nan danda'a.
You really don’t.	Dhuguma hin gootu.
They want children.	Ijoollee barbaadu.
Or could it have been something else?	Moo waan biraa ta’uu danda’a ture?
I know this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu nan beeka.
I'm sure they should be.	Ta'uu akka qaban mirkanaa'adha.
Then we have it.	Sana booda qabna.
That's all she was to him.	Isheen isaaf kana qofa ture.
It wants something long, but not too long.	Waan dheeraa barbaada, garuu baay'ee dheeraa miti.
What, she didn't know.	Maal, isheen hin beektu turte.
Everything was different then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti hundi adda ture.
It doesn't look good.	Gaarii hin fakkaatu.
He looked at me for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf na ilaale.
But this is something new.	Garuu kun waan haaraa dha.
He had his day.	Guyyaa isaa qaba ture.
I think it does, to some extent.	Ni qaba jedheen yaada, hanga tokko.
I couldn't get one at the time.	Yeroo sanatti tokko argachuu hin danda'u ture.
That seems to be a no-brainer.	Sun waan hin qabne fakkaata.
I know what works.	Waan hojjetu nan beeka.
It is important to us.	Nuuf barbaachisaa dha.
But, of course, they had.	Garuu, beekamaadha, akka qaban turan.
Even a stranger.	Nama hin beekne illee.
There is nothing special about this picture.	Suuraa kana irratti wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
After a while he looked up.	Yeroo muraasa booda ol jedhee ilaale.
It's mine, you know.	Kan kooti beekta.
You were just being.	Ati qofa ta'aa turte.
I’ve never had anyone ask me that before.	Kanaan dura namni akkas na gaafate hin beeku.
Among the few things we need to do now.	Wantoota muraasa amma hojjechuu qabnu keessaa.
Never in our lives.	Jireenya keenya keessatti gonkumaa.
It is usually great.	Yeroo baayyee guddaa dha.
Who is this person ?	Namni kun eenyu ?
She was in a bad mood.	Miira hamaa keessa turte.
It’s not our problem.	Rakkoo keenya miti.
It may not be you.	Si ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It seems to have made me a new person.	Nama haaraa waan na godhe fakkaata.
He is here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana as jira.
You have to think.	Yaadu qabda.
How many times do we need to say this.	Yeroo meeqa kana jechuun nu barbaachisa.
It was on for hours.	Sa'aatii baay'ee irra ture.
There was only one reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni tokko qofa ture.
She just didn’t tell me.	Isheen qofa natti hin himne.
This can’t be happening.	Kun ta’aa jiraachuu hin danda’u.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
Now I went alone.	Amma kophaa koo deeme.
It is very dangerous.	Balaa guddaa qaba.
But this was not enough.	Kun garuu gahaa hin turre.
This time, he.	Yeroo kana, inni.
You have to be outside.	Ati ala ta'uu qabda.
They are good at this.	Isaan kana irratti ga'umsa qabu.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
It’s different from yours.	Kan kee irraa adda.
It’s not a time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu miti.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
He looked him in the eye.	Ija keessa isa ilaale.
I love her so much.	Baay'een ishee jaalladha.
There can be no other.	Kan biraa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
We have enough of us.	Nu gahaa qabna.
Just not sure what it is.	Maal akka ta'e qofa mirkanaa'aa miti.
What she was up to.	Waan isheen irra turte.
It's different when it's your job.	Yeroo hojii kee ta'u adda.
I don't know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'u hin beeku.
But there is so much more to it than her.	Garuu ishee caalaa waan baay'ee of keessaa qaba.
But he is a very good teacher.	Garuu barsiisaa baayyee gaarii dha.
That said, that's not necessarily a bad thing.	Kana jechuun sun waan hamaa ta'uu hin qabu.
He looked the other way.	Karaa biraa ilaale.
You need someone like me.	Nama akka koo si barbaachisa.
He really did that.	Dhuguma akkas godhe.
But she has to go home.	Isheen garuu gara manaatti deebi'uu qabdi.
It really didn’t matter.	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabu ture.
I think these are not bad people.	Kun namoota hamaa miti jedheen yaada.
There is no such thing.	Waan akkasii hin jiru.
You can tell me.	Natti himuu dandeessu.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
But she was not helpless.	Isheen garuu gargaarsa hin qabne hin turre.
We are.	Nuti ... dha.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
Many of us have to eat out alone.	Baay'een keenya kophaa keenya ala nyaachuu qabna.
This wouldn't be right.	Kun sirrii hin ta'u ture.
Time didn’t matter.	Yeroon homaa hin turre.
Sometimes, people do good deeds against their will.	Yeroo tokko tokko, namoonni fedhii isaanii malee hojii gaarii hojjetu.
But I can't go back into them.	Garuu isaan keessa deebi'uu hin danda'u.
Should be back tomorrow afternoon.	Boru waaree booda deebi'uu qaba.
But not from this one.	Isa kana irraa garuu miti.
She was one of them.	Ishee tokko turte.
You know where you want to eat, just tell me.	Bakka nyaachuu barbaaddu beekta, natti himi qofa.
And he did it again.	Ammas ni godhe.
He has good friends.	Hiriyyoota gaarii qaba.
Take a look!	Mee ilaalaa!
I like the cat.	Saree natti tola.
She seems to be a real person.	Nama dhugaa waan taate fakkaata.
But maybe that's just me.	Garuu tarii sun ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
If so, it was a mistake.	Yoo akkas ta'e dogoggora ture.
This was not true.	Kun dhugaa hin turre.
That was a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ture.
Right then and there.	Yeroo sanatti fi achitti.
Certain that you haven't.	Mirkanaa'aa akka hin qabdu.
Then something happened.	Sana booda wanti tokko ta'e.
He didn’t look like him.	Isa hin fakkaatu ture.
Everything was fine after that.	Sana booda wanti hundi gaarii ta'e.
This was not who it was supposed to be.	Kun eenyu ta'uu qabu hin turre.
Year, month, day.	Waggaa, ji'a, guyyaa.
You have to eat it.	Nyaachuu qabda.
I know exactly.	Ani sirriitti beeka.
None of this involves speaking.	Kun tokkollee dubbachuu kan of keessaa qabu miti.
This is my job.	Kun hojii kooti.
Which, luckily, they do.	Kan, akka carraa ta'ee, isaan godhu.
I'm so sorry.	Baay'een dhiifama.
Maybe, you know, it'll be better than anybody's done before.	Tarii, beekta, namni kanaan dura hojjete caalaa gaarii ta'a.
Something more environmental interest.	Wanti tokko caalaa fedhii naannoo.
No one else has ever said that about me.	Namni biraa waa'ee koo akkas jedhee hin beeku.
It obviously shouldn't be.	Ta'uu akka hin qabne ifaadha.
I didn't tell him anything.	Ani homaa itti hin himne.
One of those two has to give.	Isaan lamaan sana keessaa tokko kennuu qaba.
It was working before today.	Har'a dura hojjechaa ture.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
But I can find nothing about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa homaa argachuu hin danda'u.
I have a feeling this one will be another one.	Inni kun kan biraa ta'a jedheen miira qaba.
Not exactly, she said.	Sirriitti miti jette.
It is not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa miti.
She had never been so alone in her life.	Jireenya ishee keessatti akkasitti kophaa ishee hin turre.
We only have two.	Lama qofa qabna.
None could exist.	Tokkollee jiraachuu hin danda'u ture.
It’s a good name.	Maqaa gaarii dha.
I really want to do this.	Kana gochuu baay'een barbaada.
Someone who is different.	Nama adda ta'e.
She still has it, and one of them includes this one.	Ammallee qabdi, isaan keessaa tokko isa kana of keessaa qaba.
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
This means that you are not alone in this work.	Kana jechuun hojii kana keessatti ati kophaa kee miti.
They didn’t have it.	Hin qaban turan.
He seemed to know.	Waan beeku fakkaata ture.
Someone more important needs to answer.	Namni kana caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e tokko deebii kennuu qaba.
No one has a nickname.	Namni maqaa maqaa ijoollee qabu hin jiru.
Nothing happens for a long time after that.	Sana booda yeroo dheeraaf homaa hin ta'u.
Tell me one thing.	Tokko natti himi.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
There is nothing we can do.	Waan gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
I am very happy.	Ani baayyee gammadeera.
They were there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti achi turan.
That's not going to happen.	Sun ta'uuf hin deemu.
I hadn’t expected to do that.	Ani akkas nan godha jedhee hin yaadne ture.
He had two children.	Ijoollee lama qaba ture.
Of course, there are problems.	Rakkoon akka jiru beekamaadha.
Look inside their house again.	Ammas mana isaanii keessa ilaalaa.
Love this so much.	Kana baay'ee jaalladhu.
That just made my whole night.	Sun halkan koo guutuu qofa godhe.
It doesn't seem like a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa hin fakkaatu.
So you're not going.	Kanaaf hin deemtu.
Nothing matters now.	Amma wanti dhimma qabu hin jiru.
Very good question.	Gaaffii baayyee gaarii.
It wasn’t a question.	Gaaffii hin turre.
It always works.	Yeroo hunda ni hojjeta.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
He is not in this situation.	Haala kana keessa hin jiru.
I’ve known him for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa beeka.
I gave him mine.	Kan koo itti kenne.
But it was nothing new.	Garuu waan haaraa hin turre.
The light was out there.	Ifa achi ala ture.
I was with him.	Isa waliin ture.
Just as simple as that.	Akkuma salphaa sana.
Which needs to be revisited.	Kan itti deebi’uu qabu.
That’s as dangerous as it comes.	Sun hamma dhufu balaa qaba.
Something she said was wrong.	Wanti isheen jette tokko dogoggora ture.
People help me.	Namoonni na gargaaru.
This is our job.	Kun hojii keenya.
No one else got in with her.	Namni biraa ishee waliin hin galle.
You’re just in it to do the best you can.	Waan dandeessu hunda caalaa hojjechuuf qofa achi keessa jirta.
But it’s not bad.	Garuu hamaa miti.
Such a task is not easy.	Hojiin akkasii salphaa miti.
Good luck!	Carraa gaarii!
That’s when our problems began.	Yeroo sanatti rakkoon keenya jalqabe.
I’m always with her kids.	Yeroo hundumaa ijoollee ishee waliin jira.
I want you with me.	Ana waliin si barbaada.
There would be such feelings later.	Miira akkasii yeroo booda ni jiraata ture.
But it works for us.	Garuu nuuf hojjeta.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu qofa.
You are so special.	Akka malee adda taate.
You could have gone home.	Silaa gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeessa turte.
But he doesn't say.	Garuu hin jedhu.
You have to work harder.	Caalaatti hojjechuu qabda.
I had to do something.	Waan tokko gochuun qaba ture.
You.	Ati.
Now they’re in the way.	Amma isaan karaa keessa.
It was a terrible accident.	Balaa hamaa ture.
But she did just that.	Isheen garuu akkas goote.
I couldn't even cry.	Iyyuu hin dandeenye.
But it's one thing.	Garuu waan tokko.
They need to get it right.	Isaan sirriitti argachuu qabu.
Clearly, this is not the whole picture.	Kun suuraa guutuu akka hin taane ifaadha.
She didn’t have to do it.	Isheen gochuun dirqama hin turre.
It is, and it still isn't.	Ni jira, ammas hin ta'u.
I really don’t know what to do.	Dhuguma maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I know you did that.	Akkas akka goote nan beeka.
That means she has to be a whole person.	Kana jechuun nama guutuu ta’uu qabdi.
Not a bad idea though.	Yaada hamaa miti garuu.
That should be more than enough.	Sun gahaa ol ta’uu qaba.
I have nothing to tell him.	Waan itti himu hin qabu.
She was on it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf irra turte.
He wanted it so badly.	Inni akka malee barbaade.
That’s what he was trying to do.	Kana gochuuf yaalaa ture.
I knew better than that.	Kana caalaa nan beeka ture.
They are looking into that issue.	Dhimma sana ilaalaa jiru.
I couldn’t say how much time had passed.	Yeroon meeqa akka darbe dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
But they don’t have it.	Garuu hin qaban.
I really don’t know what to say.	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku.
But it is too bright at night.	Garuu halkan garmalee ifaadha.
It was that feeling of coming home.	Miira gara manaatti deebi'uu sana ture.
We are in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirra.
They used to do everything together.	Duraan waan hunda waliin hojjetu turan.
He looked at me.	Na ilaale.
This is very important.	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
This time of year.	Yeroon waggaa kun.
But she was wrong.	Garuu dogoggora qabdi turte.
But he's on to something.	Garuu waan tokko irra jira.
It was right here, right now.	Sirriitti as ture, yeroo ammaa.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
I wasn’t trying them.	Isaan yaalaa hin turre.
Why, it doesn’t matter.	Maaliif, dhimma hin qabu.
He made a mistake.	Dogoggora hojjete.
Bigger than you can possibly know.	Kan ati beekuu dandeessu caalaa guddaa.
It was one of the two.	Isaan lamaan keessaa tokko ture.
I am.	Ani ... dha.
He didn't seem to be.	Inni waan ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
We were together for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf waliin turre.
We have something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qabna.
I didn't want trouble.	Rakkoo hin barbaanne.
I wonder why.	Maaliif jedheen yaada.
These were there.	Isaan kun achi turan.
I may not be.	Ani ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
There was nothing else' she said, 'but space.	Wanti biraa hin turre' jette, 'bakka malee.
I thought it was just me.	Ana qofa natti fakkaate.
I can never be.	Ani gonkumaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
You should have known me better.	Silaa caalaatti na beekuu qabda turte.
They are still with me.	Ammas na bira jiru.
It was a really bad situation.	Dhuguma haala hamaa ture.
Tell me about your day.	Waa'ee guyyaa kee natti himi.
Try it again.	Ammas yaalaa.
You don’t need it.	Si hin barbaachisu.
That could happen again.	Sun ammas taʼuu dandaʼa.
You need them.	Isaan si barbaachisa.
I really couldn’t find how to do this.	Dhuguma akkamitti akka kana godhu argachuu hin dandeenye.
She was still in the car.	Ammallee konkolaataa keessa turte.
It was here.	Halkan ture.
But it didn’t happen that way.	Garuu akkasitti hin taane.
Yesterday was that day.	Kaleessa guyyaa sana ture.
He did not speak to anyone of what he saw.	Waan arge keessaa nama tokkollee hin dubbanne.
Maybe it wouldn’t work for you.	Tarii siif hin hojjetu ture.
He was a very neat man.	Nama baayyee sirrii ture.
It was her.	Ishee ture.
Not to be.	Ta'uuf miti.
For a while, that’s all.	Yeroo muraasaaf, kana qofa.
It should have been with you.	Silaa si waliin ta'uu qaba ture.
But after today .	Garuu har'a booda .
They certainly never do.	Isaan gonkumaa akka hin goone beekamaadha.
Today is a day, so far so good.	Har'a guyyaa tokko, hanga ammaatti akkas gaarii.
He thought he had a chance.	Carraa waan qabu itti fakkaate.
I am a new person.	Ani nama haaraa dha.
One was today.	Tokko har'a ture.
Where are they going?	Eessa deemaa jiru?
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
But not everyone is so lucky.	Garuu namni hundi akkas carraa hin qabu.
I really want it to be good.	Gaarii akka ta'uuf baay'een barbaada.
I think it's a very important part of being human.	Nama ta'uu keessatti kutaa baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e natti fakkaata.
From this	Kana irraa .
Work, work.	Hojii, hojii.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I thought there would be.	Ni jiraata jedheen yaade.
But today, it was different.	Har'a garuu, adda ture.
You were me.	Ati ana turte.
Not everyone can get everything they want.	Namni hundi waan barbaadu hunda argachuu hin danda'u.
I don’t know how he knows, but he does.	Akkamitti akka beeku hin beeku, garuu ni beeka.
Maybe this wasn't what he should have asked, he thought.	Tarii kun waan inni gaafachuu qabu miti jedhee yaade.
You may already know this, you may not.	Kana duraan beekta ta'a, hin beektu ta'a.
Maybe, just maybe, this could work.	Tarii, tarii qofa, kun hojjechuu danda'a.
You can't be evil.	Hamaa ta'uu hin dandeessu.
All of her.	Hundi ishee.
You have to tell me the truth.	Dhugaa jiru natti himuu qabda.
As it happens, it came from someone else.	Akkuma ta'u nama biraa irraa dhufe.
It was a good thing.	Waan gaarii ture.
He stays with me all day.	Guyyaa guutuu na bira jiraata.
She looks a lot like her old self.	Isheen baay'ee ofii ishee durii fakkaata.
I'm there, too.	Anis achi jira.
Mass.	Hanga.
You have to tell us something.	Waan tokko nutti himuu qabda.
We have to eat then.	Yeroo sana nyaachuu qabna.
He was happy with me.	Ana waliin gammade.
I didn’t think of that.	Sana hin yaadne.
She was really very nice.	Dhuguma baayyee namatti tola turte.
It doesn’t matter who you are.	Eenyu akka taate homaa hin qabu.
It’s a language.	Afaan dha.
Sometimes they need a little help.	Yeroo tokko tokko gargaarsa xiqqoo isaan barbaachisa.
But he doesn’t even seem to notice.	Garuu waan hubate illee hin fakkaatu.
Maybe it's too much.	Tarii garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
I think we did pretty well with that.	Sana kanaan baayyee gaarii hojjenne jedheen yaada.
It was an easy mistake to make.	Dogoggora salphaa hojjechuuf ture.
But it may not have.	Garuu qabaachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
It was too much for him.	Isaaf baay'ee ture.
Was it like that? 	Akkas turee?
Where you have everything, but, nothing.	Bakka ati waan hundumaa qabdu, garuu, homaa hin taane.
That's not how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qabu miti.
I don't mean it, though.	Ani jechuu koo miti garuu.
Like that time a long time ago.	Akkuma yeroo sanaa yeroo dheeraa dura.
I can't see that.	Sana arguu hin danda'u.
So far everything has been working fine.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjechaa ture.
This is not my opinion.	Kun yaada koo miti.
It's going to be this one.	Isa kana ta'a.
That’s just my opinion.	Yaada koo kana qofa.
Such a picture.	Suuraa akkasii.
I didn’t meet my eyes.	Ija kootti wal hin argine.
They are extremely different.	Isaan garmalee adda.
I think this should be right.	Kun sirrii ta'uu qaba natti fakkaata.
Everything about him was different.	Waa'ee isaa wanti hundi adda ture.
But you don't know that.	Ati garuu sana hin beektu.
Here, there is no hope.	Asitti, abdiin hin jiru.
I just didn’t want that life.	Jireenya sana qofa hin barbaanne.
He had two houses and two cars.	Mana lama, konkolaataa lama qaba ture.
It’s no different than what you are.	Waan ati taate irraa adda miti.
There are two reasons.	Sababa lama qaba.
Which he probably does.	Kan inni gochuu hin oolu.
This is not good.	Kun gaarii miti.
But that was not the case.	Garuu wanti jiru akkas hin turre.
But it’s out there.	Garuu ala jira.
They still care about you.	Ammallee siif yaadu.
I'm not exactly sure how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku.
I have a lot of work to do.	Hojii baay'een qaba.
They weren’t all that wrong at the time.	Yeroo sanatti hundi isaanii hangas dogoggora hin turre.
Most people only have one.	Namoonni baay'een tokko qofa qabu.
Then it was on.	Sana booda irra ture.
It can, of course.	Danda'a, beekamaadha.
It wasn’t really a question.	Dhuguma gaaffii hin turre.
But it’s not entirely without risk.	Garuu guutummaatti balaa malee miti.
I’ve only seen that a couple of times in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti yeroo lama lama qofa akkas arge.
Everything you can have.	Waan qabaachuu dandeessu hunda.
He should be back tomorrow.	Boru deebi'uu qaba.
It didn’t look good.	Gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
I don't understand why.	Sababni isaa akka maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle.
What worked, worked.	Wanti hojjete, hojjete.
Lots of light.	Ifa baay'ee.
Of all places.	Bakka hunda keessaa.
It wasn’t right.	Sirrii hin turre.
Something obvious.	Waan ifa ta'e.
I really think this one is going to go somewhere.	Dhuguma inni kun bakka tokko deemuuf deema jedheen yaada.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku, dhuguma.
That is very important to us.	Sun nuuf baayʼee barbaachisaa dha.
It’s not just an idea.	Yaada qofa miti.
He seems very happy now.	Amma baayyee waan gammade fakkaata.
It was complete.	Guutuu ta'ee ture.
So please just do that.	Kanaaf mee akkas qofa godhu.
Just glad she was gone.	Isheen akka hin jirre qofa gammade.
I have little interest in it.	Fedhii xiqqoo itti qaba.
One thing seems fairly clear, though.	Wanti tokko garuu hamma tokko ifa fakkaata.
She was obviously working.	Isheen hojjechaa akka turte ifaadha.
He told his mother.	Haadha isaatti hime.
To help people.	Namoota gargaaruuf.
Which was really nice.	Kan dhuguma namatti tola ture.
That's how it goes.	Akkasitti deema.
That day.	Guyyaa sana.
This problem lasted for a while.	Rakkoon kun yeroo muraasaaf ture.
I still have no voice.	Ammas sagalee hin qabu.
You should know this much.	Hanga kana beekuu qabdu.
It may be necessary.	Barbaachisaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I never called her mother.	Ani haadha ishee jedhee hin beeku.
Nothing went beyond him.	Wanti isa bira darbe hin jiru.
It was one night when we were at the bar.	Halkan tokko yeroo mana dhugaatii sana turre ture.
I don't mean you.	Si jechuu koo miti.
You're there.	Achi jirta.
Without one hand.	Harka tokko malee.
I knew the truth!	Dhugaa jiru nan beeka ture!
It’s really just not a good thing at all.	Dhuguma tasumaa waan gaarii miti qofa.
This is very problematic.	Kun baayyee rakkoo qaba.
We all need to work together to do this.	Kana gochuuf hundi keenya waliin hojjechuu qabna.
There was no one here.	Asitti namni hin turre.
You are very lucky.	Baay'ee carraa qabda.
Then it happened.	Sana booda ta'e.
They are mine.	Isaan kan kooti.
Now, we have to do it this way.	Amma, haala kanaan gochuu qabna.
Someone who didn’t want him here.	Nama asitti isa hin barbaanne.
They have no problems.	Isaan rakkoo hin qaban.
I really don’t think so.	Dhuguma akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
I knew it.	Ani beeka ture.
That should have been enough.	Silaa sun gahaa ta'uu qaba ture.
But every night, I saw nothing.	Garuu halkan hunda, homaa hin argine.
You don't want to.	Hin barbaaddu.
If not, you can do it.	Yoo hin jirre gochuu dandeessa.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
They should have met again.	Silaa ammas wal arguu qabu turan.
You shouldn’t do this.	Kana gochuu hin qabdu.
Today she was before us.	Har'a isheen nu dura turte.
None of this will be easy.	Kun tokkollee salphaa hin ta'u.
You may only get one chance, you may not get any.	Carraa tokko qofa argachuu dandeessa, tokkollee argachuu dhiisuu dandeessa.
It was just like this.	Akkuma kana ture.
I mean, you know what he’s saying.	Waan inni jedhu ni beekta jechuu kooti.
You better do that.	Ati akkas gochuu wayya.
That's why it happened.	Kanaaf ta'e.
I just could not say what that was.	Sun maal akka taʼe qofa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
He said he liked it that way.	Akkas natti tola jedhe.
Me, this is me.	Ana, kun ana.
This was going to happen.	Kun ta'uuf ture.
Otherwise, he was just excellent.	Yoo kana hin taane, inni baayyee gaarii qofa ture.
They had no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qaban turan.
That wasn’t big enough though.	Sun garuu guddaa gahaa hin turre.
The answer she has.	Deebii isheen qabdu.
But he knew the right answer.	Garuu deebii sirrii ta'e beeka ture.
I can't see it.	Ani arguu hin danda'u.
Maybe he doesn't have it.	Tarii hin qabu ta'a.
I'm going to go too.	Anis deemaa jira.
But it had happened.	Garuu ta'ee ture.
Not that it was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture jechuu miti.
But that’s not the case right now.	Garuu yeroo ammaa kana akkas miti.
Then came the need.	Sana booda wanti barbaachisu dhufe.
He was already doing pretty well.	Inni duruu baayyee gaarii hojjechaa ture.
But after my time.	Garuu yeroo koo booda.
It all became about her, not my business.	Hundi isaa dhimma koo osoo hin taane waa'ee ishee ta'e.
You’re making me do all this.	Kana hunda akkan godhu na gochaa jirta.
But there may not be much time.	Garuu yeroon baay'ee jiraachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
It doesn't, it can't, it can't.	Hin ta'u, ta'uu hin danda'u, ta'uu hin danda'u.
But he wasn’t interested.	Garuu fedhii hin qabu ture.
A really important issue.	Dhimma dhuguma barbaachisaa ta'e.
That's all.	Hanga sana qofa.
I want this dress.	Uffata kana nan barbaada.
I know there’s more to it than that.	Kana caalaa akka jiru nan beeka.
I need this.	Kana na barbaachisa.
We did it.	Ni goone.
None of this is happening.	Kana keessaa tokkollee ta'aa hin jiru.
I know we can do it.	Akka dandeenyu nan beeka.
It will never happen.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
No one had to tell me anything.	Namni homaa natti himuu hin qabu ture.
But not that much.	Garuu hamma sana miti.
I think it will be good.	Gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada.
But it was more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa ture.
He made it clear he didn’t want her anymore.	Kana booda akka ishee hin barbaanne ifa godhe.
Everything was in working order.	Wanti hundi haala hojii irra ture.
It just doesn't happen that way to real people.	Namoota dhugaa irratti akkasitti hin ta'u qofa.
I don't have to say anything.	Ani homaa jechuu hin qabu.
Really a big help to us.	Dhuguma gargaarsa guddaa nuuf.
He may not get another chance.	Carraa biraa argachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
But that passed, quickly.	Garuu sun darbe, dafee.
I knew this was it.	Kun akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
Someone has to say.	Namni tokko jechuu qaba.
Once he did that.	Yeroo tokko akkas godhe.
But he got a lot more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa waan baay'ee argate.
It was his mistake.	Dogoggora isaa ture.
That’s how it was.	Akkas turee.
People knew her.	Namoonni ishee beeku turan.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin qabu ture.
You don’t go for an afternoon nap.	Hirriba waaree booda hin deemtu.
I think you can do something nice for him.	Waan gaarii isaaf gochuu dandeessa jedheen yaada.
I'm very interested.	Baay'een fedhii qaba.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
We were just living in a trailer.	Konkolaataa konkolaataa keessa jiraachuu qofa turre.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Kun waan akkasii akka hin taane ifaadha.
He needs a bad one.	Hamaa tokko isa barbaachisa.
Now he is gone.	Amma inni hin jiru.
. . . .	.
I wasn't sure it would work.	Akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But it's not about being alone.	Garuu waa'ee kophaa ta'uu miti.
That’s how you can help her.	Akkasitti ishee gargaaruu dandeessa.
But it’s there.	Garuu achi jira.
He was in her.	Inni ishee keessa ture.
The worst mistake of his life.	Dogoggora jireenya isaa keessaa isa hamaa.
It wouldn't have been right.	Silaa sirrii hin ta'u ture.
Something can happen twice.	Wanti tokko yeroo lama taʼuu dandaʼa.
That could be a reason why you might be excluded.	Sun sababa ati ala ta’uu danda’u ta’uu danda’a.
I don't want this.	Ani kana hin barbaadu.
You have to live.	Jiraachuu qabda.
This one is now in your hands.	Inni kun amma harka keessan jira.
It doesn't mean much.	Waan baay'ee jechuu miti.
It was all mine.	Hundi isaa kan koo ture.
No one was interested in his idea.	Yaada isaa kanaaf namni fedhii qabu hin turre.
This is one.	Kun tokko.
It just seemed right.	Waan sirrii ta'e qofa fakkaata ture.
Later he is now here.	Booda amma as jira.
Who doesn’t know.	Eenyu hin beeku.
He said it wouldn't happen.	Hin ta'u jedhe.
It was like everything else.	Akkuma waan hundumaa ture.
I have my own.	Kan koo qaba.
Some of our stuff will be up there.	Wanti keenya tokko tokko achi ol ni jiraata.
I think that’s what they have in common.	Wanti isaan wal fakkaatu kanuma natti fakkaata.
Not in the afternoon.	Waaree booda miti.
You don’t love your husband.	Ati abbaa manaa kee hin jaallattu.
Then its wrong.	Sana booda dogoggora isaa.
What did you say?	Maal jette?
He knew he had to do something.	Waan gochuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
That has to go away.	Sun deemuu qaba.
But if you are.	Garuu yoo taate.
None of them had anything bad to say.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan hamaa jedhu hin qabu ture.
What is special about this area?	Naannoo kana maaltu adda taʼe?
Now, he thought.	Amma, jedhee yaade.
Maybe it never will be.	Tarii yoomiyyuu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I looked up at him.	Ol jedheen ilaale.
You’re still here.	Ammallee as jirta.
It was a very good meal.	Nyaata baayʼee gaarii ture.
Maybe more than them.	Tarii isaan caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
I could be wrong.	Ani dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
That never happened.	Sun ta'ee hin beeku.
But it took time to do so.	Kana gochuuf garuu yeroo itti fudhate.
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu akkas miti.
I want them gone.	Isaan akka hin jirre nan barbaada.
I wouldn’t want that.	Ani akkas hin barbaadu ture.
I haven’t even gone on a real date yet.	Hanga ammaatti guyyaa dhugaa illee hin deemne.
I didn’t speak but he looked at me.	Hin dubbanne garuu inni na ilaale.
I have no idea how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
He was easy with his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa wajjin salphaa ture.
Then that's it.	Sana booda kanuma ta'a.
But these people were different.	Garuu namoonni kun adda turan.
A lot of things can happen.	Waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a.
I'm sitting here.	Ani as taa'a.
So much better, maybe.	Kanaaf baay'ee gaarii ta'a, tarii.
He is still there.	Ammas achi jira.
I'm not even sure what it really is.	Dhuguma maal akka ta'e illee mirkanaa'aa miti.
We still have a long way to go.	Ammas karaa dheeraa qabna.
You knew he would.	Akka inni godhu beekta turte.
Maybe he was exactly what she was looking for.	Tarii inni sirriitti waan isheen barbaaddu taʼuu dandaʼa.
You just do it.	Ati qofa gootu.
Maybe you can help me.	Tarii na gargaaruu dandeessu ta'a.
I couldn't speak for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
Now he was a man.	Amma nama ture.
But in life, he bought her time.	Jireenya keessatti garuu yeroo ishee bite.
But it could be worse.	Garuu kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
More would be much better.	Caalaatti baay'ee gaarii ta'a.
This was right.	Kun sirrii ture.
Then he went away.	Sana booda ni deeme.
What would have happened?	Silaa maaltu taʼa?
One of them was his daughter.	Isaan keessaa tokko intala isaa turte.
They are still here for you.	Ammallee siif as jiru.
They have a lot of money, but they are not like us.	Maallaqa hedduu qabu malee akka keenya miti.
I don’t have him in this house.	Mana kana keessatti isa hin qabu.
They are in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jiru.
No one else does that all the time like that.	Namni biraa yeroo hunda akkasitti akkas godhu hin jiru.
But what we are about .	Garuu waan nuti waa'ee .
I don’t want to stay here.	Ani as turuu hin barbaadu.
Someone needs to tell us what we did.	Waan hojjenne namni tokko himuu qaba.
All those parents.	Warra sana hunda.
I hope that’s not true.	Sun dhugaa akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
He speaks the truth.	Inni dhugaa dubbata.
Or a car?.	Moo konkolaataa?.
I know him very well.	Ani baay'een isa beeku.
It went a bit like this.	Xiqqoo akkasitti deeme.
Not much really happens here.	Dhuguma asitti waan baay'ee hin ta'u.
I saw him yesterday morning.	Kaleessa ganama isa arge.
But still no luck.	Garuu ammas carraa hin qabu.
There just seems to be so many possibilities.	Waan baay'ee ta'uu danda'u waan jiru qofa fakkaata.
No reason is needed.	Sababni hin barbaachisu.
Maybe I'll even have one day.	Tarii guyyaa tokko illee qabaachuu danda'a.
This can’t be happening.	Kun ta’aa jiraachuu hin danda’u.
You can’t make us do anything.	Waan tokko akka goonu nu gochuu hin dandeessu.
Neither of you told anyone.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu namatti hin himne.
He couldn’t tell.	Inni beekuu hin dandeenye.
He says he needs money.	Maallaqa isa barbaachisa jedha.
It was one of those feelings.	Miira sana keessaa tokko ture.
But there is.	Garuu jira.
More than he knew himself, perhaps.	Ofii beeku caalaa tarii.
About the car.	Waa'ee konkolaataa.
I don't know what you are.	Maal akka taate hin beeku.
I mean, hopefully.	Abdiin jechuu kooti.
Now that doesn’t exist.	Amma sun hin jiru.
It has a picture.	Suuraa qaba.
I knew him.	Ani isa beeka ture.
He always says what he means.	Yeroo hundumaa waan jechuu barbaade dubbata.
That sounds good.	Sun gaarii fakkaata.
She hadn't agreed to anything yet.	Hanga ammaatti homaa irratti walii hin galle turte.
Things like that.	Wantoota akkasii.
It was terrible.	Hamaa ture.
Very well then.	Baayyee gaarii yeroo sana.
She had children.	Ijoollee qabdi turte.
It’s such a good thing.	Waan akkasii gaarii dha.
It wasn’t for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hin turre.
Of course, that never happens.	Sun gonkumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I'm sure that was right.	Sun sirrii akka ture mirkanaa'adha.
Only.	Qofa.
It won't be easy.	Salphaa hin ta'u.
People want that to happen.	Namoonni akkas ta'u barbaadu.
It was completely evil.	Guutummaatti hamaa ture.
I love that light.	Ifa sana nan jaalladha.
But that was a long time ago.	Sun garuu yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Looking for a new job soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti hojii haaraa barbaada.
I still haven’t thought of that.	Ammallee akkas hin yaadne.
I don’t mean her.	Ishee jechuu koo miti.
I don't really have much else to say.	Dhuguma waan biraa baay'ee jedhu hin qabu.
He’s going to be leaving soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti deemuuf jira.
Not much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee miti.
It was late in the day.	Yeroon isaa booda ture.
More than I know about her.	Waa'ee ishee beeku caalaa.
I don’t do that that much.	Ani hangas akkas hin godhu.
What ever happens, happens.	Wanti yoomiyyuu ta'u, ni ta'a.
Must be much later.	Baayyee booda ta'uu qaba.
I have no idea what the problem could be.	Rakkoon jiru maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu.
Which we need to work on.	Kan irratti hojjechuu qabna.
This makes you everything that happens before you.	Kun si dura waan ta'u hundumaa si godhu.
I'm really really sorry.	Dhuguma dhuguma dhiifama.
He knew some facts.	Dhugaa tokko tokko beeka ture.
Not out here.	As ala miti.
That's how it usually works.	Yeroo baayyee akkasitti hojjeta.
This is not clear at all.	Kun tasumaa ifa miti.
But they shouldn't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin qaban.
You are absolutely correct.	Ati guutummaatti sirrii dha.
It took over three hours.	Sa'aatii sadii ol itti fudhate.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
None of them are around.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee naannoo hin jiru.
We are not good at many.	Baayyee irratti ga'umsa hin qabnu.
We’re going to go.	Deemaa jirra.
It was a homeless place.	Bakka mana hin qabne ture.
I was his around him.	Ani isaa naannoo isaa ture.
It will never happen.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
Every little thing.	Waan xiqqoo hunda.
I can't stay long now.	Amma yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u.
He was not a great man.	Nama guddaa hin turre.
He was an adult at the time.	Yeroo sanatti nama guddaa ture.
He just went everywhere.	Bakka hunda qofa deeme.
Look around you.	Naannoo keessan ilaalaa.
Still something, something.	Ammas waan tokko, waan tokko.
They don’t have length.	Dheeraa hin qaban.
It was a girl.	Intala ture.
It's not a return.	Deebi'uu miti.
It was just too big.	Garmalee guddaa qofa ture.
That said, my mouth spoke.	Kana jechuun afaan koo dubbate.
He is not my best.	Inni hunda caalaa koo miti.
We just need your father.	Abbaa kee qofa nu barbaachisa.
It was just my life.	Jireenya koo qofa ture.
She was always waiting for me.	Yeroo hundumaa na eegaa turte.
He thought about it again.	Ammas itti yaade.
He was older.	Inni umuriin isaa guddaa ture.
Just now, there’s no work going on inside.	Amma qofa, hojiin keessa deemaa jiru hin jiru.
She said come back.	Deebi'i jette.
He had to make this work.	Kana akka hojjetu gochuu qaba ture.
Maybe I'll never see her again.	Tarii kana booda ishee arguu hin danda'u.
They are all very clear.	Hundi isaanii baayyee ifaadha.
It doesn’t always mean everything else is best.	Yeroo hundumaa wanti biraa hundi hunda caalaa gaarii dha jechuu miti.
Maybe they care, maybe they don't.	Tarii dhimma qaban ta'a, tarii hin qaban ta'a.
But you know it was.	Garuu akka ture ni beektu.
We would never have done that.	Silaa gonkumaa akkas hin goonu turre.
I can still see it.	Ammas arguu nan danda'a.
It works so well.	Akkasitti akka gaariitti hojjeta.
This was no easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa hin turre.
You don’t do it.	Ati hin gootu.
I can't stay.	Turuu hin danda'u.
I don't know much more we can do.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee hojjechuu dandeenyu hin beeku.
He didn’t seem to have a name.	Maqaa waan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
Usually not myself when you are around.	Yeroo baayyee yeroo ati naannoo jirtu ofii koo miti.
No one you know.	Nama ati beektu hin jiru.
All we need is light.	Wanti nu barbaachisu ifa qofa.
Very her indeed.	Baayyee ishee dhuguma.
But they are human.	Garuu isaan nama.
Everything there was.	Wanti achi jiru hundi ture.
He lives alone in a small house.	Mana xiqqoo tokko keessa kophaa isaa jiraata.
Good on her.	Ishee irratti gaarii.
I didn't need it.	Na hin barbaachifne.
She wasn’t real, none.	Isheen dhugaa hin turre, tokkollee hin turre.
You really need it.	Dhuguma si barbaachisa.
He knew what was going to happen.	Waan ta'u ni beeka ture.
But he didn't need it.	Garuu isa hin barbaachifne.
So many of us were.	Kanaaf baay'een keenya turre.
I had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I was both of those people.	Ani namoota sana lamaan ture.
Tell them the truth.	Dhugaa jiru itti himi.
This is my room, he thought.	Kun kutaa kooti jedhee yaade.
I wasn't even sure she wanted it anymore.	Kana booda akka barbaaddu illee mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I really need it.	Dhuguma na barbaachisa.
He knew what to do.	Waan godhu beeka ture.
That could be me.	Sun ana ta'uu danda'a.
She has a chance.	Carraa qabdi.
Your reason is valid.	Sababni kee sirrii dha.
I have a few questions.	Gaaffii muraasa qaba.
No one knew him.	Namni isa beeku hin turre.
I, of course, wanted to stay inside.	Ani, beekamaadha, keessa turuu barbaade.
Such a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa akkasii.
he asked me, smirking.	jedhee na gaafate.
I saw her again that night.	Halkan sana ammas ishee arge.
After a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa booda.
I knew what it was like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture.
This is my issue.	Kun dhimma kooti.
The problem was, he was right.	Rakkoon ture, inni sirrii ture.
I don't know about anyone else.	Waa'ee nama biraa hin beeku.
They always do a good job.	Yeroo hundumaa hojii gaarii hojjetu.
Bad feeling here.	Miira hamaa asitti.
It worked really well for him.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti isaaf hojjete.
I don't think so.	Natti hin fakkaatu.
There is now.	Amma jira.
She couldn’t do that to him.	Isheen akkas isa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I was with someone.	Nama tokko waliin ture.
It was a good thing.	Waan gaarii ture.
I can never do it.	Yoomiyyuu hin danda'u.
That’s your problem.	Rakkoon kee kanuma.
I owe it to him.	Ani dirqama isaaf qaba.
I couldn't find it.	Ani argachuu hin dandeenye.
They knew better.	Isaan kana caalaa beeku turan.
It’s a good name.	Maqaa gaarii dha.
It could have gone very, very differently.	Silaa baayyee baayyee adda ta'ee deemuu danda'a ture.
You don’t need an excuse anymore.	Kana booda sababa si hin barbaachisu.
I think you are in a very bad situation when that happens.	Yeroo sun ta'u haala baayyee hamaa keessa jirta jedheen yaada.
He was there this morning.	Ganama kana achi ture.
They are not like you.	Isaan akka kee miti.
I couldn’t see anything.	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
She was just more of herself.	Isheen ofii ishee caalaa qofa turte.
It can't be just me.	Ana qofa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I can't stay.	Turuu hin danda'u.
That’s not a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii miti.
It’s just something that came later.	Waan booda dhufe qofa.
It's not going to be that bad.	Akkas hamaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
Lots and lots of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee fi baay'ee.
I don't have much to do with any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waanan baay'ee hin qabu.
They're waiting for you upstairs.	Ol si eegaa jiru.
Man knows better.	Namni caalaatti beeka.
I couldn’t do anything else.	Waan biraa gochuu hin dandeenye.
None of us are there.	Tokkollee keenya hin jiru.
He is not a tall man.	Nama dheeraa miti.
I couldn’t do anything there.	Achitti homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
He is one of us.	Inni nu keessaa tokko.
But now, it has more space than we need.	Amma garuu, bakka nu barbaachisu caalaa qaba.
They didn't have much of everything.	Waan hundumaa baay'ee hin qaban turan.
I can't play with them.	Isaan waliin taphachuu hin danda'u.
It’s not just school.	Mana barumsaa qofa miti.
He wouldn’t exist anymore.	Silaa kana booda hin jiru ture.
I'm not now.	Ani amma miti.
I have nothing funny to say this week.	Torban kana waan qoosaa jedhu hin qabu.
You know those people.	Namoota sana ni beektu.
But sometimes they’re very, very, very obvious.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko baay’ee baay’ee baay’ee ifa ta’u.
She's nice.	Isheen namatti tola.
I have no idea.	Ani yaada hin qabu.
I saw them today.	Har'a isaan arge.
He wasn’t doing so great.	Inni akkas guddaa hojjechaa hin turre.
I have feelings about it.	Ani waa'ee isaa miira qaba.
This is a good question.	Kun gaaffii gaarii dha.
It’s not right then.	Yeroo sana sirrii miti.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
He is no longer there.	Kana booda hin jiru.
You have to have an idea.	Yaada qabaachuu qabda.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
He just didn’t seem to know how to play with kids.	Inni ijoollee waliin taphachuu waan hin beekne qofa fakkaata ture.
We have almost no time.	Yeroo hin qabnu jechuun ni danda'ama.
They should know now.	Isaan amma beekuu qabu.
If you don’t have help, you have to tell yourself.	Gargaarsa yoo hin qabne ofitti himuu qabda.
She didn’t know where she was going.	Eessa akka deemtu hin beektu turte.
It’s better to work.	Hojii hojjechuu wayya.
I can't stay.	Turuu hin danda'u.
That.	Sana.
This is the time of my life.	Yeroon kun yeroo jireenya kooti.
I wonder what happened to that dog.	Saree sana maaltu ta'e jedheen yaada.
You have one chance.	Carraa tokko qabda.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
But he didn’t seem to have enough.	Garuu waan gahaa waan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
But he told him about his mother.	Inni garuu waa'ee haadha isaa itti hime.
This may not be good.	Kun gaarii ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
It’s never been much.	Baay’ee ta’ee hin beeku.
All the way.	Karaa hunda.
One day, of course.	Guyyaa tokko, beekamaadha.
He must know these things.	Wantoota kana beekuu qaba.
One must be oneself.	Namni of ta'uu qaba.
That doesn't help me, much.	Sun na hin gargaaru, baay'ee.
Friends, please think of me.	Hiriyyoota mee naaf yaada.
It doesn't have anything.	Waan homaa hin qabu.
You have to help me.	Na gargaaruu qabda.
I mean, she’s absolutely right.	Isheen guutummaatti sirrii dha jechuu kooti.
I don't know how that matters.	Sun akkamitti akka barbaachisaa ta'e hin beeku.
He was a man.	Nama ture.
But it’s not right.	Garuu sirrii miti.
It has a great sound.	Sagalee guddaa qaba.
But of course that is not the case.	Garuu akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
There would be no more after today.	Har'a booda kan biraa hin jiru ture.
It's been pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee jira.
He isn’t.	Inni miti.
I don't know what that is.	Sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
You have to be very easy with her.	Ishee waliin baayyee salphaa ta'uu qabda.
It's been two days now.	Amma guyyaa lama.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
But they knew where he was.	Garuu eessa akka jiru ni beeku turan.
I'm sure it will turn out well.	Akka gaariitti akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha.
But that just wasn’t the case.	Garuu sun waan hin turre qofa.
He should have worked on that.	Silaa sana irratti hojjechuu qaba ture.
It was too much for us.	Nutti baay'ee ture.
Everything had its place, even me.	Wanti hundi bakka isaa qaba ture, ana illee.
Interview with me.	Gaaffii fi deebii ana.
This is not true at all.	Kun tasumaa dhugaa miti.
I can't walk much.	Deemu baayyee hin danda'u.
There were a lot of people.	Namoonni baay'ee turan.
He is still here.	Ammas as jira.
I love everything.	Waan hundumaa nan jaalladha.
One of our best features.	Waan gaarii keenya keessaa tokko.
He was doing good parents.	Inni warra gaarii hojjechaa ture.
I know him, just.	Ani isa beeka, qofa.
We hope it is true.	Dhugaa ta'uu abdii qabna.
Not just today.	Har'a qofa miti.
She was at home.	Mana turte.
Tell me that again.	Ammas akkas natti himi.
Of course, you can just ask them.	Isaan gaafachuu qofa akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
He was a duty.	Inni dirqama ture.
I want it very much.	Baay'een barbaada.
Everything looks right.	Wanti hundi sirrii fakkaata.
One day at that time.	Yeroo sanatti guyyaa tokko.
Everyone can still say whatever they want.	Ammallee namni hundi waan barbaade dubbachuu danda'a.
It's a very good idea.	Yaada baayyee gaarii dha.
He used to be one of those kids.	Inni kanaan dura ijoollee sana keessaa tokko ture.
Which he certainly was .	Kan inni akka ture beekamaadha .
No one knows.	Namni tokkollee hin beeku.
You can make a new photo.	Suuraa haaraa hojjechuu dandeessu.
That has never happened before.	Kana dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
That’s not the right way.	Sun karaa sirrii miti.
He wanted to know everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu barbaade.
It's never happened before.	Kanaan dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
I don’t know where to go from here.	As irraa eessa akka deemu hin beeku.
She was with her when it happened.	Yeroo ta'u ishee waliin turte.
Not much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee miti.
But then, that was nothing new.	Garuu sana booda, sun waan haaraa hin turre.
I can buy new clothes.	Uffata haaraa bitachuu nan danda'a.
It's not really about that.	Dhuguma waa'ee sanaa miti.
This was not the case.	Kun akkas hin turre.
Do you always know the right answer?	Yeroo hundumaa deebii sirrii beektaa?
It was never enough.	Gonkumaa gahaa hin turre.
I am as good as you are.	Ani akkuma kee gaarii dha.
Do you like me? 	Ati natti tola?

Perhaps some of the partying was at her home.	Tarii affeerraa sana keessaa tokko tokko mana ishee taʼuu dandaʼa.
You can see them a lot.	Baay'ee isaan arguu dandeessa.
But that didn’t work.	Garuu sun hin hojjenne.
With that, to.	Sana waliin, gara.
I wanted to do it.	Anis gochuu barbaade.
He can do whatever he wants in life.	Jireenya keessatti waan barbaade hunda gochuu danda'a.
What makes us human is thought, not action.	Kan nama nu godhu yaada malee hojii miti.
But this time he saw nothing.	Yeroo kana garuu homaa hin argine.
Some truth, some inaccuracy, as always.	Dhugaa tokko tokko, sirrii hin taane tokko tokko, akkuma yeroo hundumaa.
He shouldn't say it.	Hin jechuu qaba.
It looks like where it is now.	Bakka amma jiru sana fakkaata.
They were there now.	Amma achi turan.
They should know.	Beekuu qabu.
That's not who he is.	Eenyu akka ta'e kanuma miti.

There was nothing else for her to do.	Wanti isheen gochuu qabdu kan biraa hin turre.
I know better now.	Amma caalaatti beeka.
We need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna.
He spoke to me.	Natti dubbate.
You don't like this stuff.	Waan kana hin jaallattu.
All the things that aren’t really true.	Wantoota dhuguma dhugaa hin taane hunda.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Dogoggora hin turre.
I knew nothing about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
He will do his best.	Waan danda'u hunda ni hojjeta.

I know it was good.	Gaarii akka ture nan beeka.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
None of them were interested.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee fedhii hin qabu ture.
I can't believe it came.	Dhufe jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
All this time.	Yeroo kana hunda.
He might get lucky.	Carraa argachuu danda'a.
No way.	Gonkumaa hin ta''u.
But he can't.	Garuu hin danda'u.
I'm sure she needs a father as much as you need her.	Isheen akkuma ati ishee barbaaddu abbaa akka barbaaddu mirkanaa'adha.
But it’s just wrong.	Garuu dogoggora qofa.
I’m glad I did it.	Hojjechuu kootti gammadeera.
It just happens to be what happens.	Waan ta'u qofa ta'a.
This, as always, has been just business time.	Kun akkuma yeroo hundumaa yeroo hojii qofa ta’ee ture.
This should never happen.	Kun gonkumaa ta'uu hin qabu.

But no one would do it.	Garuu namni tokkollee hin hojjetu ture.
Maybe it's not.	Tarii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
There is no good place.	Bakka gaarii hin jiru.
But you’re not in that situation anymore.	Garuu kana booda haala sana keessa hin jirtu.
Now that, voice of.	Amma sana, sagalee of.
But that is not enough in my case.	Sun garuu dhimma koo irratti gahaa miti.
There were three people with him.	Isa waliin namoonni sadii turan.
I wouldn’t have wanted that.	Silaa akkas hin barbaadu ture.
You can, you absolutely can.	Ni dandeessa, guutummaatti gochuu dandeessa.
I couldn’t do anything with him.	Isa waliin homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe that's all you need to know.	Tarii wanti beekuu qabdu kana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
He needed some work.	Hojii tokko tokko barbaada ture.
Where you want to be.	Bakka ta'uu barbaaddu.
If we’re going to do this thing together.	Yoo waan kana waliin hojjechuuf deemne.
It doesn't even have to be great.	Dirqama guddaa ta'uu illee hin qabu.
But she was a good girl.	Isheen garuu intala gaarii turte.
We are here to do a job.	Hojii tokko hojjechuuf as jirra.
I should never have done it.	Silaa gonkumaa gochuu hin qabu ture.
No one saw it coming.	Namni dhufuu isaa arge hin turre.
You are my father.	Ati abbaa kooti.
This was going to be easy.	Kun salphaa ta'uuf ture.
But that was a long time ago.	Garuu sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Of course, not every night.	Halkan hunda akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I didn't think anything else about it.	Waa'ee kanaa waan biraa hin yaadne.
Just a little bit of backtracking.	Xiqqoo duubatti deebi'uu qofa.
We need it more than anything.	Waan hundumaa caalaa nu barbaachisa.
He wanted to do everything he wanted to do, but with her.	Waan gochuu barbaadu hunda gochuu barbaade, garuu ishee waliin.
No picture, no name for you.	Suuraa hin qabu, maqaa hin qabu siif.
He was a dog.	Inni saree ture.

Ana, ana, ana.	Ana, ana, ana.
They are always there.	Yeroo hundumaa ni jiru.
It could be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
You couldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu hin dandeessu turte.
If she hadn't done it.	Osoo isheen hin goone ta'ee.
It’s a new year.	Bara haaraa dha.
He had a lot of them.	Isaan baay'ee qaba ture.
You can't be	Ta'uu hin dandeessu .
He knew they only had one chance.	Carraa tokko qofa akka qaban beeka ture.
We are, however, human.	Nuti garuu nama.
He wanted to stay.	Turuu barbaade.
You are in a room.	Ati kutaa tokko keessa jirta.
He didn’t tell anyone what he saw.	Waan arge namatti hin himne.
But I doubt I could do this.	Garuu kana gochuu akkan danda'u nan shakka.
He was himself again.	Inni ammas ofii isaa ture.
He said a little bit.	Xiqqoo jedhe.
What's it for you?.	Maal siif ta'a?.
There could only have been one possibility.	Carraan jiru tokko qofa ta’uu danda’a ture.
They had to help.	Gargaaruu qabu turan.
I don't have a reason.	Ani sababa hin qabu.
Check it out here.	As keessaa ilaalaa.
I love that guy.	Gurbaa sana nan jaalladha.
This is just what works for me.	Kun waan naaf hojjetu qofa.
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
It's never really been an issue for us.	Dhuguma dhimma nuuf ta'ee hin beeku.
It’s so loud.	Akkasitti sagalee guddaa qaba.
It was my only hope.	Abdii koo qofa ture.
Something really neat.	Waan dhuguma sirrii ta'e.
There were three people in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa namoonni sadii turan.
It may be too late.	Yeroon isaa darbe ta'uu danda'a.
He had a job to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
I know you want some.	Tokko tokko akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
This had to be hers.	Kun kan ishee ta'uu qaba ture.
One day, without problems.	Guyyaa tokko, rakkoo malee.
More than good.	Gaarii caalaa.
A lot of people didn't.	Namoonni baay'een hin goone.
You know it works on its own.	Ofii isaatiin akka hojjetu beekta.
You know you can’t do anything.	Waan tokkollee hojjechuu hin dandeenye beekta.
That doesn't happen here.	Sun asitti hin ta'u.
He speaks three languages.	Afaan sadii dubbata.
Keeping them from talking.	Akka hin dubbanne gochuu.
Thus, of course, it could not be better.	Akkasitti, kana caalaa ta’uu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
I don't understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin galle.
Three too many.	Sadii baay'ee.
With me, with your father, with this guy.	Ana waliin, abbaa kee waliin, gurbaa kana waliin.
I wanted to go, too.	Anis deemuu barbaade.
I don’t want to have that.	Sana qabaachuu hin barbaadu.
Way.	Karaa.
I should never have come here.	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture.
That wasn’t an issue.	Sun dhimma hin turre.
Home again, home again.	Ammas manaa, ammas manaa.
John was delighted.	Yohaannis ni gammade.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a.
That started one day.	Sun guyyaa tokko jalqabe.
I really didn’t have time this year.	Dhuguma bara kana yeroo hin qabu ture.
You can say more than that.	Kana caalaa dubbachuu dandeessu.
This, however, did not happen.	Kun garuu hin taane.
The father of the father.	Abbaa kan abbaa.
I just thought you should know.	Beekuu qabdu qofa jedheen yaade.
It wouldn't be so bad.	Silaa akkas hamaa hin ta'u.
He didn't say much.	Waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
I couldn't do it.	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye.
That seemed inevitable.	Sun waan hin oolle fakkaata ture.
This time, he had his answer.	Yeroo kana, deebii isaa qaba ture.
Who is that person?	Namni sun eenyu?
No one was with him at the time, of course.	Yeroo sanatti namni isa waliin akka hin turre beekamaadha.
It wasn’t a joke.	Qoosaa hin turre.
I have the same situation.	Anis haala wal fakkaatu qaba.
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
I can't ask more of them.	Kana caalaa isaan gaafachuu hin danda'u.
I don’t have a wife anymore.	Kana booda haadha manaa naaf hin jiru.
It was a completely new concept for me.	Guutummaatti yaada haaraa naaf ture.
He didn't know what he was thinking.	Maal akka yaadu hin beekne.
Maybe then it will be.	Tarii sana booda ni ta'a.
Not much happens there.	Achitti waan baay'ee hin ta'u.
He didn't tell me anything.	Homaa natti hin himne.
I can't say I enjoyed it.	Itti gammadeera jechuu hin danda'u.
It should be more important than that.	Kana caalaa barbaachisaa ta'uu qaba.
You know it, you know.	Ni beekta.
If you don’t want to do something, don’t do it.	Yoo waan tokko hojjechuu hin barbaanne hin goone.
I think they can do some very good things.	Waan baayyee gaarii tokko tokko hojjechuu danda'u jedheen yaada.
That should say it all.	Sun hunda jechuu qaba.
It was another eye.	Ija biraa ture.
But maybe that wasn't true.	Garuu tarii sun dhugaa hin turre ta'a.
I just couldn’t do the job.	Hojii sana hojjechuu qofa hin dandeenye.
We didn’t even see it.	Nuti illee hin argine.
Something didn't seem right about it.	Waa'ee kanaa wanti tokko sirrii hin fakkaatu ture.
This seems to work fine.	Kun waan gaarii hojjetu fakkaata.
But you knew that.	Ati garuu kana beekta turte.
He is with me.	Inni na waliin jira.
Maybe they were both drinking.	Tarii lamaan isaanii dhugaa turan ta'a.
How long ago it seems.	Yeroo meeqa dura fakkaata.
It was on the moon.	Ji'a irra ture.
I really have no hope.	Dhuguma abdii hin qabu.
I know he was from her.	Inni ishee irraa akka ture nan beeka.
He did not recognize the voice.	Sagalee sana hin beekne.
But he apparently doesn’t need any of it.	Garuu tokkollee isa hin barbaachisu fakkaata.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baayyee itti gammadeera.
I didn’t really want the truth.	Dhuguma dhugaa hin barbaanne.
But not very often.	Garuu yeroo baay'ee miti.
I just can't find any.	Ani tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u qofa.
I don’t know when you’ll be here.	Yoom akka as jirtu hin beeku.
Hope it helps you.	Akka si gargaaru abdii qabna.
I don't know if this is going to be a problem.	Kun rakkoo ta'uuf deemu hin beeku.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Garuu isa qofa hin turre.
But this is my job.	Garuu kun hojii kooti.
That's going to be a lot of work.	Sun hojii guddaa ta'uuf deema.
You can still live your life.	Ammas jireenya kee jiraachuu dandeessa.
I knew it very well.	Ani baay'ee beeka ture.
It was a good location.	Bakka gaarii ture.
. . . .	.
It was true.	Dhugaa ture.
They are looking for you.	Isaan si barbaadaa jiru.
They are very obvious.	Isaan baayyee ifaadha.
I think you like him a lot.	Baayyee isa jaallattu jedheen yaada.
I couldn't believe it.	Amanuu hin dandeenye.
I mean completely.	Guutummaatti jechuu kooti.
Then he went along	Sana booda waliin deeme
Nothing can get him here this day.	Guyyaa kana wanti asitti isa argachuu hin danda'u.
We need to talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu qabna.
But it does more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa hojjeta.
She probably doesn't know herself.	Ofii ishee hin beektu ta'a.
I can't get enough of him.	Isa gahaa argachuu hin danda'u.
But now, things were different.	Amma garuu, wanti jiru adda ture.
I’m pretty sure you have no idea what that means.	Sun maal jechuu akka ta’e yaada akka hin qabne mirkanaa’aa dha.
He seemed to be.	Inni fakkaata ture.
This is becoming a joke.	Kun qoosaa ta'aa jira.
But we don’t have that.	Garuu nuti akkas hin qabnu.
I don’t know myself.	Of hin beeku.
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
We have a serious problem.	Rakkoo hamaa qabna.
But I couldn’t see him anymore.	Garuu kana booda isa arguu hin dandeenye.
What can I do.	Maal gochuu danda'a.
I do think you are on to something.	Ani garuu waan tokko irratti waan jirtu natti fakkaata.
I mean really, really bad.	Dhuguma, dhuguma hamaa jechuu kooti.
But that doesn’t seem to be the problem here.	Garuu asitti rakkoon jiru kanuma hin fakkaatu.
He wanted evil.	Hamaa barbaade.
Ours is very similar.	Kan keenya baayyee wal fakkaata.
He talked about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dubbate.
So he said he was sorry.	Kanaaf dhiifama jedhe.
I knew nothing about her at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waaʼee ishee homaa hin beeku ture.
Perhaps he	Tarii inni .
That was a terrible thing.	Sun waan hamaa ture.
We had to respond.	Deebii kennuu qabna turre.
But you can do this for me.	Garuu kana naaf gochuu dandeessa.
There seemed to be nowhere to go.	Bakka itti deemu waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
He said it wouldn't happen.	Hin ta'u jedhe.
Not when she didn’t.	Yeroo isheen hin hojjenne miti.
He matters.	Inni dhimma qaba.
We have little time though.	Yeroo xiqqoo qabna garuu.
You have a good father and mother.	Abbaa fi haadha gaarii qabda.
Sounds like a good place.	Bakka gaarii ta'e fakkaata.
No one should have known.	Silaa namni beekuu hin qabu ture.
Maybe it's just too new.	Tarii baayyee haaraa qofa ta'uu danda'a.
She doesn’t want him now, not like that.	Isheen amma isa hin barbaaddu, akkasitti miti.
The answer button.	Qabduu deebii.
You're like you.	Ati akka ati.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
He knew it wasn’t a picture.	Suuraa akka hin taane ni beeka ture.
I'm really not sure of anything.	Dhuguma waan tokko mirkanaa'aa miti.
The chances are good.	Carraan jiru gaarii dha.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
I mean, there were a lot of them.	Baay'ee turan jechuu kooti.
Which, of course, she did.	Kan, beekamaadha, isheen akka goote.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
We are all here now.	Hundi keenya amma as jirra.
It was different.	Adda ture.
We went there.	Achi deemne.
I have no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
But she could see nothing.	Isheen garuu homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
It is not like that at all.	Tasumaa akkas miti.
You don’t look well.	Akka gaariitti hin fakkaattu.
I think it's true.	Dhugaa natti fakkaata.
Sorry about that.	Dhiifama waa'ee isaa.
He needs some time.	Yeroo muraasa isa barbaachisa.
He is not the man he used to be.	Inni nama duraan ture miti.
No one knew what had happened.	Waan ta'e namni beeku hin turre.
I think this is good.	Kun gaarii dha jedheen yaada.
I don’t know who they were.	Eenyu akka turan hin beeku.
You can always outstay your time.	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo kee caalaa turuu dandeessa.
It looked like new.	Haaraa fakkaata ture.
It was a great room.	Kutaa guddaa ture.
It was my idea.	Yaada koo ture.
From just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa irraa.
They love us.	Nu jaallatu.
He has something other guys don’t have.	Waan gurbaa biraa hin qabne qaba.
It’s all new.	Hundi isaa haaraa dha.
We are on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra jirra.
I think you know.	Beektu natti fakkaata.
So that’s how it started.	Kanaaf akkasitti jalqabe.
I can't believe I'm doing this.	Kana gochaa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
That's just plain true.	Sun dhugaa ifa ta'e qofa.
I don’t know how to help her.	Akkamitti akkan ishee gargaaru hin beeku.
There is no absolute right or wrong here.	Asitti sirrii fi dogoggora guutuu hin jiru.
It wasn’t even a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii illee hin turre.
I know that little bit.	Xiqqoo sana nan beeka.
I wanted to do it again.	Ammas hojjechuu barbaade.
He had to stay on.	Irra turuu qaba ture.
He just had to say it.	Jechuu qofa qaba ture.
But it's like that.	Garuu akkas.
I don’t like him here.	Asitti isa hin jaalladhu.
Sorry I wasn't expecting you.	Dhiifama si eegaa hin turre.
I will always love him very much.	Ani yoomiyyuu baay'een isa jaalladha.
Nothing has passed.	Wanti darbe hin jiru.
She should have known that all along.	Silaa yeroo hundumaa kana beekuu qabdi turte.
I know you don’t want to believe this.	Kana amanuu akka hin barbaanne nan beeka.
She wasn't sure she wanted to.	Akka barbaaddu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
She had no idea what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
But that seems a lot.	Garuu sun baayyee fakkaata.
People know each other’s issues.	Namoonni dhimma walii beeku.
That doesn’t mean he still doesn’t love you.	Kana jechuun ammallee si hin jaallatu jechuu miti.
Same question, same answer.	Gaaffii wal fakkaatu, deebii wal fakkaatu.
You both just know.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu qofa beektu.
He had that.	Sana qaba ture.
What is this.	Kun maali.
I don't have time for that.	Kanaaf yeroo hin qabu.
Everyone had an opinion.	Namni hundi yaada qaba ture.
I have been watching how you do it.	Akkamitti akka gootu ilaalaa tureera.
This already seems simple.	Kun duruu salphaa fakkaata.
I mean really.	Dhuguma jechuu kooti.
He didn't say why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin dubbanne.
Can you help me help him?.	Akkan isa gargaaru na gargaaruu dandeessaa?.
It was a previous job.	Hojii duraan ture.
They loved each other.	Wal jaallatu turan.
He asked a question.	Gaaffii gaafate.
We really meant it.	Dhuguma jechuu barbaanne.
You can find it here.	As irraa argachuu dandeessu.
It seemed right.	Sirrii fakkaata ture.
He seems to be doing really great.	Dhuguma waan guddaa hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
So it can't be necessary.	Kanaaf barbaachisaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Interested in a few questions.	Gaaffii muraasaaf fedhii qabu.
Just check them out now!	Amma qofa isaan ilaalaa!
This never works.	Kun gonkumaa hin hojjetu.
It was a big deal at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan guddaa ture.
It would be a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ta'a.
To do something.	Waan hojjechuuf.
I have to go back.	Ani duubatti deebi'uu qaba.
You can make them real.	Isaan dhugaa gochuu dandeessa.
That’s all I want to say.	Kana qofa jechuu barbaada.
That's how it might be.	Akkas ta'uu danda'a.
He thought she had a problem.	Rakkoo waan qabdu itti fakkaate.
Just by chance.	Akka carraa ta'ee qofa.
That's what happens.	Kanuma ta'a.
She knew little of anything.	Isheen waan xiqqoo beektu turte.
I think it’s his father who has the real big money.	Maallaqa guddaa dhugaa kan qabu abbaa isaa natti fakkaata.
Then it wasn’t.	Sana booda hin turre.
He's in the area apparently.	Inni naannoo sana jira fakkaata.
She had said that.	Isheen akkas jettee turte.
It was a nice afternoon.	Waaree booda gaarii ture.
I am currently looking for a job.	Yeroo ammaa kana hojii barbaadaa jira.
That's your otherness.	Sun kan biraa ta'uu kee.
That way I didn't even have to say much.	Akkasitti waan baay'ee dubbachuu illee hin barbaachifne.
I want to be authentic.	Ani dhugaa ta'uu barbaada.
I really want to see him.	Isa arguu baay'een barbaada.
I still don't understand.	Ammallee hin hubanne.
I like it that way.	Akkasitti natti tola.
Who you should be.	Eenyu ta'uu qabda.
Not a very good book.	Kitaaba baayyee gaarii miti.
I didn't speak to him.	Ani itti hin dubbanne.
Good luck there.	Carraa gaarii achitti.
Things were very different in those days than they are now.	Bara sanatti wanti amma jiru irraa baayʼee adda ture.
What did he mean.	Maal jechuu ture.
She said it before.	Kanaan dura jette.
I can speak.	Dubbachuu nan danda'a.
He was wrong.	Inni dogoggora ture.
There is no hope for us.	Abdiin nuuf hin jiru.
So tell me a little bit about yourself.	Kanaaf waa'ee kee xiqqoo natti himi.
It takes commitment.	Of kennuu barbaachisa.
No one can do better.	Namni kana caalaa hojjechuu danda'u hin jiru.
You can still be great, it will be.	Ammas guddaa ta'uu dandeessa, ni ta'a.
But it didn’t matter.	Garuu dhimma hin qabu ture.
They say he wants to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechuu barbaada jedhu.
I couldn't think.	Yaadu hin dandeenye.
There wasn't much time.	Yeroon baay'ee hin turre.
What works today, may not work tomorrow.	Wanti har'a hojjetu, boru hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
They were wrong.	Dogoggora turan.
It probably won't.	Hin ta'u hin oolu.
How many times a year was this?	Waggaa keessatti yeroon kun yeroo meeqa ture?
Not about that at all.	Waa'ee sanaa tasumaa miti.
In the interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii irratti...
It was only a couple of days.	Guyyaa lama lama qofa ture.
Everything and everyone.	Waan hundumaa fi nama hunda.
He bought two shoes.	Kophee lama bite.
I used to love your mother.	Duraan haadha kee nan jaalladha ture.
I could have everything.	Waan hundumaa qabaachuu nan danda'a ture.
But that night he did something terrible.	Halkan sana garuu waan hamaa hojjete.
They were usually right.	Yeroo baayʼee sirrii turan.
It doesn’t matter why, it’s just that you’re here now.	Maaliif akka taate homaa hin qabu, amma as jiraachuu kee qofa.
He didn’t really want to know.	Inni garuu dhuguma beekuu hin barbaanne.
It has an easy job.	Hojii salphaa qaba.
Many people will go.	Namoonni baay'een ni deemu.
It can never last.	Gonkumaa turuu hin danda'u.
It can still be great.	Ammas guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
After a while he looked up.	Yeroo muraasa booda ol jedhee ilaale.
People can help me with that, she said.	Sana irratti namoonni na gargaaruu danda'u jette.
That wouldn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu ture.
I don't have any problems.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin qabu.
It just feels good in your hands.	Harka kee keessatti miira gaarii qofa.
I don’t know the area.	Naannoo sana hin beeku.
He found them.	Isaan argate.
I know you want it with me.	Na waliin akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
So something is happening.	Kanaaf wanti tokko ta'aa jira.
It’s not really a book.	Dhuguma kitaaba miti.
He eats the truth.	Inni dhugaa nyaata.
Who knows, he might even ask for your help.	Eenyutu beeka gargaarsa kee illee gaafachuu danda'a.
That doesn’t mean that.	Kana jechuu miti.
No one will ever know.	Namni yoomiyyuu hin beeku.
Someone.	Nama ta'e.
But he didn't do that.	Garuu akkas hin goone.
It is extremely important.	Garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
You are not infallible.	Ati dogoggora hin qabne miti.
Not that one though.	Isa sana miti garuu.
But this was true.	Garuu kun dhugaa ture.
But he made our home a home.	Garuu mana keenya mana godhe.
I haven’t seen you in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf si hin argine.
They are not good.	Isaan gaarii miti.
He was really here.	Dhuguma as ture.
Like you, I want the best.	Anis akkuma keessan isa gaarii barbaada.
It wasn’t that one.	Isa sana hin turre.
That’s one of his things.	Sun waan isaa keessaa tokko.
He used to work year-round.	Duraan waggaa guutuu hojjeta ture.
I used to be pretty good at this stuff.	Duraan waan kana irratti baayyee gaarii ture.
Seems easy enough!.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata!.
Can you help?.	Gargaaruu dandeessaa?.
Look at it.	Itti ilaalaa.
We had little about that.	Waa'ee sanaa waan xiqqoo qabna turre.
You know your questions will be answered.	Gaaffii kee deebii argachuu beekta.
I didn’t want to leave that life now.	Jireenya sana amma dhiisuu hin barbaanne.
But you have to eat this.	Kana garuu nyaachuu qabda.
Sometimes I get very lonely.	Yeroo tokko tokko baay'een kophaa ta'a.
It would have been great.	Silaa guddaa ta'a.
I shouldn’t have said that.	Silaa akkas jechuu hin qabu ture.
He says they will still be children.	Ammas ijoollee ta'u jedha.
It was a feeling that came with it.	Miira isa waliin dhufe ture.
But it wasn’t a bad thing.	Garuu waan hamaa hin turre.
I'm not too sure what that was.	Sun maal akka ture baay'ee hin beeku.
It should have been pretty bad.	Silaa baayyee hamaa ta'uu qaba ture.
They know it doesn’t work very well.	Baayyee akka hin hojjenne ni beeku.
That was my chance.	Carraan koo kanuma ture.
This was a dangerous time.	Yeroon kun yeroo balaa qabu ture.
I probably will.	Ani tarii nan godha.
It was where she belonged.	Bakka isheen kan taate ture.
He is doing a lot of work.	Hojii hedduu hojjechaa jira.
When that happens, it happens.	Yeroo sun ta'u ni ta'a.
As it happened.	Akkuma ta'e.
There was no reason for it.	Sababni itti ta'u hin turre.
But not entirely on the right track.	Garuu guutummaatti karaa sirrii irra miti.
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
He was such a genuine guy.	Gurbaa dhugaa akkasii ture.
How wrong it is.	Akkamitti dogoggora ta'uu isaa.
We really don’t care enough.	Dhuguma dhimma gahaa hin qabnu.
That will never happen.	Sun yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
This is now no longer necessary.	Kun amma kana booda hin barbaachisu.
I want to work with you.	Si waliin hojjechuu barbaada.
I know exactly what happens in there.	Waan achi keessa ta'u sirriitti beeka.
But, it’s not without hope.	Garuu, abdii malee miti.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
I want you now.	Amma si barbaada.
Who is she? 	Isheen eenyu?
You have nothing.	Ati homaa hin qabdu.
But that’s never enough.	Garuu sun gonkumaa gahaa miti.
That's not why, though.	Kanaaf miti garuu.
We should have gone.	Silaa deemuu qabna turre.
I want you to know something.	Waan tokko akka beektu nan barbaada.
He stayed there for a while.	Achitti yeroo muraasaaf ture.
This would be a great thing.	Kun waan guddaa ta'a.
But it is dangerous.	Garuu balaa qaba.
Need some sleep.	Hirriba tokko tokko barbaachisa.
but he can't quite do that.	garuu guutummaatti akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
He still wants it.	Ammallee barbaada.
There is no one else.	Nama biraa hin jiru.
This past hour .	Sa'aatii darbe kana .
They were waiting for him.	Isa eegaa turan.
I couldn’t live with them, not like that.	Isaan waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye, akkasitti miti.
That has been happening.	Sun ta'aa tureera.
That is probably easy.	Sun salphaa taʼuu hin oolu.
But in my day it was something else.	Bara koo garuu waan biraa ture.
I don’t know what worked.	Wanti hojjete hin beeku.
I thought it was just you.	Si qofa natti fakkaate.
Here of all places, he thought.	Bakka hunda keessaa asitti jedhee yaade.
You know what you have.	Waan qabdu ni beekta.
She didn’t have a job.	Hojii hin qabdu turte.
You never know!.	Ati gonkumaa hin beektu!.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
I know you can do this.	Kana gochuu akka dandeessu nan beeka.
During .	Yeroo .
Now.	Amma.
Which he didn’t understand.	Kan inni hin hubanne.
You can’t, you just can’t.	Hin dandeessu, hin dandeessu qofa.
Past retrospective.	Darbe duubatti deebi'uu.
Nothing more that night.	Halkan sana kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
No problem.	Rakkoo hin qabu.
I think that’s a big part of the problem.	Sun kutaa guddaa rakkoo jiru natti fakkaata.
You have to be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu qabda.
Maybe you did that in the old days.	Tarii bara durii akkas gootu ta'a.
This would be a great thing.	Kun waan guddaa ta'a.
Of course, that is something she can do.	Sun waan isheen gochuu dandeessu akka taʼe beekamaadha.
You are in serious trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa jirta.
No one asked questions.	Namni gaaffii gaafate hin jiru.
I know a lot about you.	Waa'ee kee waan baay'een beeka.
No one even knew who he was at the time.	Yeroo sanatti eenyu akka ta'e illee namni beeku hin turre.
We just couldn’t believe it.	Nuti amanuu qofa hin dandeenye.
But I am extremely happy they are back.	Garuu garmalee gammadeera deebi'uu isaanii.
I didn’t know she was.	Akka taate hin beeku ture.
Maybe some people will want it.	Tarii namoonni tokko tokko ni barbaadu ta'a.
There was nothing anyone could do at that point.	Yeroo sanatti wanti namni tokkollee gochuu danda'u hin turre.
It was easy.	Salphaa ture.
I don’t have a completely correct answer.	Deebii sirrii guutuu hin qabu.
I don't want to think.	Yaadu hin barbaadu.
You weren’t there.	Ati hin turre.
What happened.	Waan ta'e.
Just go home.	Gara manaatti deebi'uu qofa.
Certainly not in real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I think that was the problem.	Rakkoon ture kanuma natti fakkaata.
But she is not yours .	Garuu isheen kan kee miti .
He wouldn't tell me why.	Maaliif akka ta'e natti hin himu ture.
You know whether it happened or not.	Ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa ni beektu.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
We don't have anyone here.	Asitti nama hin qabnu.
Much more interested.	Baay'ee caalaa fedhii qaba.
Is she my money?	Isheen maallaqa koo?
I still have them.	Ammallee isaan qaba.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
No one seems to understand.	Namni waan hubate hin fakkaatu.
So fill yourself.	Kanaaf of guutuu.
I will do that.	Ani akkas nan godha.
I don’t know how he did that.	Akkamitti akkas akka godhe hin beeku.
By himself,.	Ofii isaatiin,.
I was just saying.	jechuu koo qofa ture.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
The old, not the new.	Kan durii malee isa haaraa miti.
I'm not exactly sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku.
Which is to say.	Kan jechuun.
It was never going to last.	Gonkumaa turuuf hin turre.
I hope it was clear.	Ifa ta'ee akka ture abdiin qaba.
It's very different there.	Achitti baayyee adda.
I said it was necessary.	Anis barbaachisaa jedheen.
You have to do this.	Kana gochuu qabda.
There was no one else in there.	Achi keessa namni biraa hin turre.
Not sure it ever will.	Yoomiyyuu akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
This is probably a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta’uu hin oolu.
We can’t know.	Beekuu hin dandeenyu.
Lots of noise this time.	Yeroo kana sagalee baay'ee.
He said he had to go now.	Amma deemuun qaba jedhe.
An easy day.	Guyyaa salphaa.
You here a lot.	Ati asitti baay'ee.
I can live with them.	Isaan waliin jiraachuu nan danda'a.
you can get it from.	irraa argachuu dandeessu.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
They may suggest some places.	Bakka tokko tokko yaada kennuu dandaʼu.
He has a good eye.	Ija gaarii qaba.
He was right about it all.	Inni waaʼee kanaa hundumaa sirrii ture.
This is where the real problem comes.	Rakkoon dhugaa kan dhufu kana.
I don't mean that.	Kana jechuu koo miti.
Many times, I taught this class.	Yeroo baayyee, kutaa kana barsiisaa ture.
How it should be.	Akkamitti ta'uu qaba.
Part of a guy, really.	Kutaa gurbaa, dhuguma.
How can you even know this?.	Kana illee akkamitti beekuu dandeessa?.
She is never wrong.	Isheen gonkumaa dogoggora hin qabdu.
Look at this carefully!	Kana sirriitti ilaalaa!
I love this place so much.	Bakka kana baay'een jaalladha.
. . . .	.
You have to do the necessary work.	Hojii barbaachisaa hojjechuu qabda.
I was home with them.	Isaan waliin mana ture.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
I don’t think anyone even knew it was there.	Namni achi akka jiru illee beeku natti hin fakkaatu.
It was a house.	Mana ture.
No one can do this for you.	Namni kana siif gochuu hin danda'u.
Unlike my wife.	Haadha manaa koo irraa adda.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
That would be it.	Sun ta'a ture.
It was an important thing in life.	Jireenya keessatti wanta barbaachisaa ture.
' ' they say.	' ' jedhu.
It works well, in most all cases.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta, irra caalaa haala hunda keessatti.
Mother, father and children.	Haadha, abbaa fi ijoollee.
But he didn't go.	Garuu hin deemne.
You are in the right place.	Bakka sirrii jirta.
I don’t need him anymore.	Kana booda isa hin barbaachisu.
But it was more than that.	Kana caalaa garuu ture.
If something happens.	Yoo wanti ta'e.
Which was the case.	Kan ture.
But they are in demand.	Isaan garuu fedhii keessa jiru.
They were at each other's houses almost every day.	Guyyaa hunda jechuun ni danda'ama mana walii turan.
It went a lot.	Baay'ee deeme.
They have a life here in three years.	Waggaa sadii booda jireenya asitti qabu.
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
It could be us.	Nu ta'uu danda'a.
He can tell me.	Inni natti himuu danda'a.
I didn't want to be out there.	Ani achi ala ta'uu hin barbaanne.
It had its time and place.	Yeroo fi bakka isaa qaba ture.
Maybe it's him.	Tarii inni ta'uu danda'a.
They didn’t want any of it.	Isaan tokkollee hin barbaanne.
Not like you.	Akka kee miti.
Everything seems to be in working order.	Wanti hundi haala hojii irra jiru fakkaata.
Look for them.	Isaan barbaadaa.
They were good people.	Isaan namoota gaarii turan.
Perhaps so, but no one knows.	Tarii akkas taʼuu dandaʼa, garuu namni tokkollee hin beeku.
But this seems unlikely.	Garuu kun waan hin taane fakkaata.
He is very good at this job.	Hojii kana irratti baay'ee gaarii dha.
It certainly did that for me.	Akkas akka naaf godhe beekamaadha.
I would do whatever she wanted.	Waan isheen barbaaddu nan godha ture.
They want their own.	Kan isaanii barbaadu.
It doesn't work very well.	Baay'ee hin hojjetu.
But that wasn’t me.	Garuu sun ana hin turre.
That was a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ture.
I can't believe it works so well, but it does.	Akkasitti akka gaariitti hojjeta jedhee amanuu hin danda'u, garuu ni hojjeta.
It could be something else.	Waan biraa ta’uu danda’a.
Sometimes something happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko wanti tokko ni ta'a.
But of course, this is wrong.	Garuu beekamaadha, kun dogoggora.
It was just like that.	Akkas qofa ture.
I have to do it.	Ani gochuun qaba.
It had to be a dog.	Saree ta'uu qaba ture.
Even a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee illee.
I wasn’t good enough.	Ani gaarii hin turre.
I don't think that should be the case.	Akkas ta'uu qaba jedhee hin yaadu.
It was a real book, through and through.	Kitaaba dhugaa ture, karaa fi karaa.
It was everywhere.	Bakka hunda ture.
They needed money.	Maallaqa isaan barbaachisa ture.
I couldn’t go any higher.	Kana caalaa ol deemuu hin dandeenye.
That's it.	Kanuma.
So I don't know if that's the reason.	Kanaaf sababni sun ta'uu hin beeku.
Something was definitely not right in there.	Wanti tokko achi keessa sirrii akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I was very happy today.	Har'a baay'een gammade.
It was my idea.	Yaada koo ture.
There were two in one person.	Lama nama tokko keessa turan.
It seemed like nothing.	Homaa waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
Now I know.	Amma beeka.
But tell me.	Garuu natti himi.
This looks really good for you.	Kun dhuguma siif gaarii fakkaata.
It's not very important today.	Har'a baay'ee barbaachisaa miti.
I was no different then.	Yeroo sanatti ani adda hin turre.
But still.	Garuu ammas.
We are not like these people.	Nuti akka namoota kanaa miti.
He didn’t see it coming.	Inni dhufuu isaa hin argine.
But, this is just a suggestion.	Garuu, kun yaada qofa.
Just now, he thought, two months had passed.	Amma qofa ji'a lama darbe jedhee yaade.
It was simple, really.	Salphaa ture, dhuguma.
But it wasn’t that simple.	Garuu hangas salphaa hin turre.
I can't say more than that.	Kana caalaa jechuu hin danda'u.
It is doing very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jira.
She didn’t see me.	Isheen na hin argine.
I didn’t think of anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin yaadne.
Exactly his own.	Sirriitti kan isaa.
I didn't see one.	Tokko hin argine.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
It's not like that, it's not like that.	Akkas miti akkas miti.
But there is still hope.	Garuu ammas abdiin jira.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
What was the truth? 	Maaltu dhugaa ture?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
He certainly understood.	Akka hubate beekamaadha.
I can't be that different.	Ani hangas adda ta'uu hin danda'u.
I'm going outside.	Ani ala nan deema.
Nothing could be clearer.	Kana caalaa wanti ifa ta’uu danda’u hin jiru.
Better than nothing.	Homaa ta'uu irra wayya.
The reason may not be.	Sababni isaa garuu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
So,	Kanaaf,
That's my business, now.	Sun dhimma kooti, ​​amma.
It is an important issue.	Dhimma barbaachisaa dha.
They were in a lot of trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa turan.
He needs it.	Isa barbaachisa.
True.	Dhugaa.
He didn’t realize she loved him.	Isheen akka isa jaallattu hin hubanne.
I don't understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle.
You can't '.	Hin dandeessu '.
Now he was going.	Amma deemaa ture.
This didn’t happen.	Kun hin taane.
Not my favorite, but something different.	Kan ani jaalladhu osoo hin taane, waan adda ta'e.
But it’s not what we wanted.	Garuu waan nuti barbaanne miti.
I didn't understand her.	Ishee hin hubanne.
They need to go with us.	Nu waliin deemuun isaan barbaachisa.
But this was more than a few ways.	Garuu kun karaa muraasa caalaa ture.
Then he found it.	Sana booda argate.
It is an important job.	Hojii barbaachisaa dha.
It was only an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko qofa ture.
It certainly did for me.	Naaf akka godhe beekamaadha.
He was watching them.	Isaan ilaalaa ture.
Didn't do a very good job.	Hojii baayyee gaarii hin hojjenne.
Everything seemed to go well.	Wanti hundi waan gaarii deeme fakkaata ture.
They don't care much with whom.	Eenyu waliin baay'ee dhimma hin qaban.
But it didn't matter why.	Garuu maaliif akka ta'e homaa hin turre.
Not this part.	Kutaa kana miti.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Kana caalaa maal gochuu akka danda'u hin beeku ture.
If you are too bad, things will go wrong.	Yoo baayyee hamaa taate wanti dogoggora ta'a.
All that exists is imagination.	Wanti jiru yaada qofa.
He certainly knew better.	Kana caalaa akka beeku beekamaadha.
That was not the case at all when mine arrived.	Yeroo kan koo dhufu tasumaa akkas hin turre.
I just don’t understand it.	Naaf hin galle qofa.
But sometimes there is no why.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko maaliif akka ta'e hin jiru.
I could never walk.	Gonkumaa deemuu hin dandeenye.
To his room.	Gara kutaa isaatti.
There is none there.	Achitti tokkollee hin jiru.
There can only be one.	Tokko qofa ta'uu danda'a.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
Not that you can ever see it.	Yoomiyyuu arguu dandeessa jechuu miti.
I love life.	Jireenya nan jaalladha.
It can be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
I know nothing about her.	Waa'ee ishee homaa hin beeku.
So they were waiting.	Kanaaf eegaa turan.
Here, there was only one.	Asitti, tokko qofa ture.
They really want to be kids.	Dhuguma ijoollee ta'uu barbaadu.
This means that	Kana jechuun .
But he didn't have it.	Inni garuu hin qabu ture.
They were the worst.	Isaan hunda caalaa hamaa turan.
It is in your eyes.	Ija keessan keessa jira.
Like most kids, he's more independent.	Akkuma ijoollee baay'ee, caalaatti of danda'a.
This would not be an easy matter.	Kun dhimma salphaa hin ta'u ture.
I think you are too sensitive to my comments.	Yaada koo kanaaf garmalee miira qabdu natti fakkaata.
I knew something was terribly wrong.	Wanti hamaa taʼe tokko akka dogoggora taʼe nan beeka ture.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
We cannot do this without him.	Isa malee kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
Only a few times.	Yeroo muraasa qofa.
It was just too dangerous.	Garmalee balaa kan qabu qofa ture.
It should be good.	Gaarii ta'uu qaba.
We were here to help.	Gargaaruuf as turre.
We are not	Nuti hin .
He was there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi ture.
I need a new pair of shoes.	Kophee haaraa na barbaachisa.
This is not just about us.	Kun waa'ee keenya qofa miti.
He made no mistake about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dogoggora hin hojjenne.
That is not our job.	Hojiin keenya akkasii miti.
Being husband and wife.	Abbaa manaa fi haadha manaa ta’uu.
He couldn't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin dandeenye.
She had a chance.	Carraa qabdi turte.
He never had her.	Inni gonkumaa ishee hin qabu ture.
For a very long time.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraaf.
It was a huge mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa ture.
Did something go wrong? 	Waan tokko dogoggora ta'ee?
Without a mother or father.	Haadha abbaa malee.
Three of them.	Isaan keessaa sadii.
You can still do this.	Ammas kana gochuu dandeessa.
We have to work now.	Amma hojjechuu qabna.
Maybe it's true.	Tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
She had him there.	Achitti isa qabdi turte.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
He’s good at what he does.	Waan hojjetu irratti gaarii dha.
Didn't see much of anyone.	Baay'ee nama hin argine.
He had to talk to him about that.	Waa'ee sanaa itti dubbachuu qaba ture.
This was something new.	Kun waan haaraa ture.
I didn't understand.	Ani hin hubanne.
In this case it doesn't.	Haala kana keessatti hin ta'u.
It wants to be the new me.	Ana haaraa ta'uu barbaada.
I shouldn’t leave her.	Ishee dhiisuu hin qabu.
Some people weren’t.	Namoonni tokko tokko hin turre.
It’s certainly not a reversible mistake.	Dogoggora duubatti deebi’uu danda’u akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He knows it's my favorite day of the year.	Guyyaa waggaa keessatti ani baay'ee jaalladhu akka ta'e ni beeka.
Now it’s just the two of us.	Amma lamaan keenya qofa jirra.
I could play everything.	Waan hundumaa taphachuu nan danda'a ture.
You could see it.	Arguu dandeessa turte.
Girl, it wasn’t a joke.	Intala, qoosaa hin turre.
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
He saw everything.	Waan hundumaa arge.
They’re almost alone there.	Achitti kophaa isaanii jechuun ni danda’ama.
She was never like that.	Isheen gonkumaa akkas turte.
This is also my opinion.	Kun illee yaada kooti.
This is not the way.	Kun karaa miti.
I really like this car.	Konkolaataa kana baay'een jaalladha.
That is, the.	Kana jechuun.
Not much different today.	Har'a baayyee adda miti.
No one ever has it.	Namni tokkollee gonkumaa hin qabu.
She hadn't had it there.	Isheen hin qabdu turte achi ture.
He is not evil.	Inni hamaa miti.
Sometimes just not in the near future.	Yeroo tokko tokko yeroo dhiyootti qofa miti.
I hadn’t thought of it that way.	Akkasitti hin yaadne ture.
It’s never on the road.	Gonkumaa karaa irra hin jiru.
They just don’t have anything in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qofa hin qaban.
I am one of those people.	Namoota sana keessaa tokko ana.
So this could all be for you.	Kanaaf kun hundi siif ta'uu danda'a.
I'm trying this.	Kana yaalaa jira.
It has everything in there.	Waan hundumaa achi keessa qaba.
I may be alone on this one.	Isa kana irratti kophaa koo ta'uu danda'a.
She is not up to any good.	Isheen hanga gaarii tokkollee hin jirtu.
But it wasn’t her .	Garuu ishee hin turre .
This is not a children’s issue.	Kun dhimma ijoollee miti.
I didn't know how or when.	Akkamitti fi yoom akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
Now you are on your way.	Amma karaa irra jirta.
I can't apologize either.	Anis dhiifama gaafachuu hin danda'u.
I’m not the person they need.	Ani nama isaan barbaachisu miti.
It’s a good thing in this case.	Haala kana keessatti waan gaarii dha.
She wasn’t that kind of person.	Isheen nama akkasii hin turre.
You were a boy.	Ati gurbaa turte.
I still don't understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ammallee naaf hin galle.
It's just a name.	Maqaa qofa.
I knew this was my time.	Yeroon koo kun akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin turre.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
You don't like this.	Kana hin jaallattu.
For one thing, they were probably a few years old.	Tokko, tarii umuriin isaanii waggaa muraasa taʼuu hin oolu.
Things were different now.	Amma wanti jiru adda ture.
You have two.	Lama qabda.
I don't think you do.	Ati waan gootu natti hin fakkaatu.
You two are in big trouble.	Isin lamaan rakkoo guddaa keessa jirtu.
But not everyone can do that.	Garuu namni hundi akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
I have to say this.	Kana jechuun qaba.
Something I didn't want to happen.	Waan ta'uu hin barbaanne.
But that was not his way.	Sun garuu karaa isaa hin turre.
I don't understand this.	Kana naaf hin galle.
But one thing	Garuu waan tokko .
You can do two things.	Waan lama hojjechuu dandeessa.
It was all so different from anything she knew.	Hundi isaa waan isheen beektu hunda irraa baayyee adda ture.
It was always a little, good.	Yeroo hundumaa xiqqoo, gaarii ture.
You have to live.	Jiraachuu qabda.
In real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti.
He was doing her good.	Gaarii ishee hojjechaa ture.
But that hardly matters.	Garuu sun baay'ee dhimma hin qabu.
He looked up at me.	Ol jedhee na ilaale.
No one will ever say.	Namni gonkumaa hin jedhu.
I'm in it.	Ani keessa jira.
This was a completely new person.	Kun nama guutummaatti haaraa ture.
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
Who eats shoes? 	Kophee eenyutu nyaata?
That's how it was.	Akkas ta'ee ture.
She doesn't want me.	Isheen na hin barbaaddu.
There were a lot of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee turan.
He really should come back.	Dhuguma deebi'uu qaba.
They know what we’ve done.	Waan hojjenne ni beeku.
But they will be out there.	Garuu isaan achi ala ta'u.
Then you can see it.	Sana booda arguu dandeessu.
It’s good so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii dha.
We have children the same age.	Ijoollee umuriin isaanii wal fakkaatu qabna.
Some people are going to do really well.	Namoonni tokko tokko dhuguma gaarii hojjechuuf jiru.
But that's not happening.	Garuu sun ta'aa hin jiru.
He lives here.	Inni as jiraata.
He didn't say it anymore.	Kana booda hin jedhe.
Every issue, every time.	Dhimma hunda, yeroo hunda.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Dogoggora hin turre.
But you can’t stay late.	Garuu yeroon booda turuu hin dandeessu.
That’s exactly what we’re all about.	Hundi keenya sirriitti kanuma.
That can be good and bad.	Sun gaarii fi hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
Now look at them.	Amma isaan ilaalaa.
I knew that was not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
He looked pretty good.	Inni baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
Then he told his father he wanted that one.	Sana booda abbaa isaatiin isa sana akka barbaadu itti hime.
They have no feelings.	Miira hin qaban.
It was just like that.	Akkas qofa ture.
I can't be.	Ani ta'uu hin danda'u.
But he had done nothing.	Garuu homaa hin goone ture.
What 's going to happen	Mee maal ta'a .
There is only one way.	Karaa tokko qofa.
But none of this is enough.	Garuu kun tokkollee gahaa miti.
They were still working.	Ammas hojjechaa turan.
But then it wasn’t.	Garuu sana booda hin turre.
It was a while.	Yeroo muraasa ture.
That you are here to stay.	Akka ati as jirtu turuuf.
We are obliged to	Nuti dirqama .
They could have gone, of course.	Silaa deemuu danda’u turan, beekamaadha.
In that section.	Kutaa sana keessatti.
This shouldn't have happened.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I want to be a teacher.	Barsiisaa ta'uu barbaada.
It was not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin turre.
Three from my mother.	Sadii haadha koo irraa.
He knew it was more real than that.	Kana caalaa dhugaa ta'uu isaa beeka ture.
I’m not going to help.	Gargaaruuf hin deemu.
But it wouldn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu ture.
It had been a great year for him.	Bara guddaa isaaf ta'ee ture.
He was right.	Inni sirrii ture.
He was just a little different.	Inni xiqqoo adda qofa ture.
But it wasn’t enough.	Garuu gahaa hin turre.
He wasn’t even really human.	Dhuguma nama illee hin turre.
I intend to go now.	Amma deemuu yaada kooti.
This isn’t a big deal.	Kun waan guddaa miti.
They are very similar.	Baayyee wal fakkaatu.
He wasn’t really human.	Inni dhuguma nama hin turre.
I might be the one.	Ani ta'uu danda'a.
Not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti.
Just maybe, but not here.	Tarii qofa, garuu asitti miti.
Everyone, then you.	Hundi, sana booda ati.
Nothing so special.	Wanti akkas adda ta'e hin jiru.
But in this case, he could.	Kana keessatti garuu, ni danda'a ture.
But that’s a bit different.	Garuu sun xiqqoo adda.
I like it very much.	Baayyee natti tola.
It was really becoming too much.	Dhuguma garmalee baay'ee ta'aa ture.
He had a great deal to do.	Waan guddaa hojjechuu qabu ture.
She wasn't sure.	Isheen mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
That would be easy.	Sun salphaa taʼa.
It took several hours.	Sa'aatii hedduu fudhate.
I really hope this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa dhuguma abdiin qaba.
One of them came to her.	Isaan keessaa tokko gara ishee dhufe.
He says wait.	Eegaa jedha.
You’re going to do me a favor.	Ati tola naaf gochuuf jirta.
She would never have been interested in him.	Silaa gonkumaa fedhii isaaf hin qabdu turte.
It was in your book.	Kitaaba keessan ture.
I didn’t know you were here.	Akka ati as jirtu hin beeku ture.
He wants you to know he has feelings.	Miira akka qabu akka beektu barbaada.
He knew he was right.	Inni sirrii akka taʼe beeka ture.
But they often do.	Yeroo baayyee garuu ni godhu.
People were good to us.	Namoonni nuuf gaarii turan.
I hope one of you can help me.	Tokko keessan akka na gargaaru abdiin qaba.
We can’t do that.	Sana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
Then it happened.	Sana booda ta'e.
I don’t even go to this school anymore.	Kana booda mana barumsaa kana illee hin deemu.
He obviously didn’t want to help me.	Inni na gargaaruu akka hin barbaanne ifaadha.
To be great.	Guddaa ta'uuf.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I'm saying that.	Ani akkas jedha.
I have that, too.	Anis sana qaba.
This was when nothing he did could help.	Yeroon kun yeroo wanti inni hojjete tokkollee gargaaruu hin dandeenye ture.
They still had little time.	Ammas yeroo xiqqoo qaban turan.
With my father.	Abbaa koo waliin.
After a great deal of trouble, of course.	Rakkoo guddaa booda, beekamaadha.
He had it bad .	Inni hamaa qaba ture .
Few people have cars.	Namoonni konkolaataa qaban muraasa.
But one thing was wrong.	Wanti tokko garuu dogoggora ture.
I'm not saying it can't happen.	Ta'uu hin danda'u jechuu koo miti.
It’s wrong.	Dogoggora qaba.
I want to know him.	Isa beekuu barbaada.
I think of him often.	Yeroo baay'ee isa nan yaada.
You’re the one, right?	Ati mitiiree?
I didn't know what to do about it.	Waa'ee isaa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
One of you guys.	Isin keessaa tokko.
It could be tomorrow.	Boru ta'uu danda'a.
But he is not a teacher.	Garuu barsiisaa miti.
But they don’t have them that way.	Garuu akkasitti isaan hin qaban.
None of that is new.	Sana keessaa tokkollee haaraa miti.
A week later she became a mother.	Torban tokko booda haadha taate.
It took a couple of hours.	Sa'aatii lama lama fudhate.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
There were three of us in a room.	Kutaa tokko keessa sadii turre.
A long time ago, rarely.	Yeroo dheeraa dura, yeroo muraasa.
They have one daughter.	Intala tokko qabu.
And it was still.	Ammas ture.
He knew he was in danger.	Balaa keessa akka jiru ni beeka ture.
You have to get the job done in plenty of time.	Yeroo baay’ee keessatti hojii sana hojjechuu qabda.
You didn’t do it.	Ati hin goone.
No one knows where he is.	Eessa akka jiru namni beeku hin jiru.
I want him here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana asitti isa barbaada.
We were in here for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf as keessa turre.
It doesn't do anything.	Homaa hin godhu.
Not here, not now.	Asitti miti, amma miti.
I think it's.	Natti fakkaata.
There were no problems at work.	Hojii irratti rakkoon tokkollee hin turre.
I don't know why or how this happened.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e fi akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
They’re really trying to do two things.	Dhuguma waan lama hojjechuuf yaalaa jiru.
We’re doing fine up here.	Asitti ol gaarii hojjechaa jirra.
Name, it’s mine.	Maqaa, kan kooti.
It just isn’t enough.	Qofa gahaa miti.
We are doing everything we can.	Waan dandeenyu hunda gochaa jirra.
He would have walked in his time.	Silaa yeroo isaa keessa deema ture.
But this time, it wasn’t.	Yeroo kana garuu, hin turre.
But never, he knew that now.	Garuu gonkumaa hin ta'u, amma akkas beeka ture.
This morning, really.	Ganama kana, dhuguma.
There is a danger.	Balaa jiru.
I'm looking for a lot today.	Har'a waan baay'ee barbaadaa jira.
That couldn't be the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas ta'uu hin dandeenye.
No one spoke for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf namni dubbate hin jiru.
I love how it turned out.	Akkamitti akka ta'e baay'een jaalladha.
She always has.	Yeroo hundumaa qabdi.
This one is going to work.	Inni kun hojjechuuf deema.
It does nothing but nothing.	Waan tokko malee homaa hin godhu.
But I saw none of this.	Garuu kana keessaa homaa hin argine.
He had quite a few.	Muraasa baayʼee qaba ture.
She was there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi turte.
Then he started coming around.	Sana booda naannoo dhufuu jalqabe.
But he would never do it.	Garuu gonkumaa hin godhu ture.
What is going on here? 	Asitti maaltu deemaa jira?
None of them worked well.	Tokkollee akka gaariitti hin hojjenne.
I can't go anymore.	Kana booda deemuu hin danda'u.
I can't do any right.	Ani sirrii tokkollee gochuu hin danda'u.
I have to go again.	Ammas deemuun qaba.
Again, he was the only guy in the room.	Ammas, kutaa sana keessatti gurbaa isa qofa ture.
He has a lot to do.	Inni waan baay'ee hojjetu qaba.
This could be huge.	Kun guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
They have two children together.	Waliin ijoollee lama qabu.
I had the exact same issue.	Anis sirriitti dhimma wal fakkaatu qaba ture.
I just can't get it on the handle.	Qabduu qofa irratti argachuu hin danda'u.
I know it's them.	Isaan akka ta'e nan beeka.
Maybe it's too much.	Tarii garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
Without Him there is no hope.	Isa malee abdiin hin jiru.
It was a little different.	Xiqqoo adda ture.
This is not the same.	Kun tokko miti.
What more could you ask for?.	Kana caalaa maal gaafachuu dandeessa?.
But he certainly doesn’t know.	Garuu akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
This was not true.	Kun dhugaa hin turre.
This isn’t me.	Kun ana miti.
Except for my mother.	Haadha koo malee.
I want everything you have.	Waan ati qabdu hunda nan barbaada.
No one looked at his answer.	Deebii inni kenne namni ilaale hin jiru.
Which he is now.	Kan inni amma ta'e.
Night for sure now.	Halkan mirkanaa'aa amma.
His other life.	Jireenya isaa kan biraa.
I can help him with that.	Sana irratti isa gargaaruu nan danda'a.
But he certainly shouldn’t.	Garuu akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
What do you know.	Maal beektu.
On the spot.	Bakka irratti.
Not very good.	Baayyee gaarii miti.
She was a little girl.	Intala xiqqoo turte.
I'm happy for you.	Siif gammadeera.
This could not last.	Kun turuu hin dandeenye.
He is the light of my life.	Inni ifa jireenya kooti.
You are both right.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu sirrii dha.
In the past year.	Waggaa darbe keessa.
Do you have what you need?.	Waan barbaachisu qabduu?.
But it can be done.	Garuu ta'uu danda'a.
I absolutely love this thing.	Waan kana guutummaatti nan jaalladha.
It’s just a car.	Konkolaataa qofa.
So sorry for that.	Kanaaf dhiifama.
She wanted to ask why.	Maaliif jettee gaafachuu barbaade.
Often.	Yeroo hedduu.
That's why it shouldn't be.	Kanaaf ta'uu hin qabu.
I have you.	Si qaba.
Out of place for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf bakka hin qabne.
He does just fine.	Inni gaarii qofa hojjeta.
He got a lot of things.	Waan hedduu argate.
I didn't see how he could.	Akkamitti akka danda'u hin argine.
You should have known that.	Silaa sana beekuu qabda turte.
We never agreed about it.	Waa'ee kanaa gonkumaa walii hin galle.
He did a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjete.
Then, nothing happened.	Sana booda, homaa hin taane.
It would have been outside.	Silaa ala ta'a ture.
But now she had no clothes.	Amma garuu uffata tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
I know you’re working, though.	Akka hojjechaa jirtu nan beeka, garuu.
This was often true.	Yeroo baay’ee kun dhugaa ture.
It didn’t seem to matter.	Dhimma waan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
She was trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa turte.
Only if it's night.	Halkan yoo ta'e qofa.
Everyone thought it was the worst thing you could say.	Namni hundi waan hamaa ati jechuu dandeessu itti fakkaate.
I don’t need clothes.	Uffata na hin barbaachisu.
I think a lot.	Baay'ee jedheen yaada.
It wouldn't be.	Hin ta'u ture.
He is exactly right.	Inni sirriitti sirrii dha.
Many of them are different.	Baay'een isaanii adda adda.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Work is not required.	Hojiin hin barbaachisu.
I'm just not sure it works.	Ani garuu akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa miti.
You can stay there tonight.	Halkan kana achi turuu dandeessu.
I am a very good mother.	Ani haadha baayyee gaarii dha.
But she wasn’t, really.	Garuu isheen hin turre, dhuguma.
I don't have any.	Ani tokkollee hin qabu.
I couldn’t do more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
He has children and you don't.	Ijoollee qabu ati hin qabdu.
I’m trying to do it well.	Ani akka gaariitti hojjechuuf yaalaa jira.
Everything will never be the same.	Wanti hundi yoomiyyuu tokko hin ta'u.
But he knows me.	Inni garuu na beeka.
They want to make money.	Maallaqa argachuu barbaadu.
The only thing that exists is the present.	Wanti jiru yeroo ammaa qofa.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
But I didn't want to go back, not really.	Garuu duubatti deebi'uu hin barbaanne, dhuguma miti.
Then again, maybe not.	Sana booda ammas tarii hin ta'u.
I think it was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ture jedheen yaada.
They want something else.	Waan biraa barbaadu.
That obviously didn’t work out that way.	Sun akkasitti akka hin deemne ifaadha.
I think she did that.	Isheen akkas goote natti fakkaata.
But it can be a very long way.	Garuu karaa baayyee dheeraa ta'uu danda'a.
They had to stay.	Turuu qabu turan.
He didn’t need another girl.	Intala biraa isa hin barbaachifne.
But look at the bigger picture.	Garuu suuraa guddaa ilaalaa.
These people are onto something else.	Namoonni kun waan biraa irra jiru.
I can't do anything for you.	Ani homaa siif gochuu hin danda'u.
In this case.	Haala kana keessatti.
Most certainly, .	Irra caalaa mirkanaa’aa ta’e, .
Probably a bit of both.	Xiqqoo lamaan keessaa ta'uu hin oolu.
We are still behind.	Ammas duubatti jirra.
A couple of times, maybe.	Yeroo lama lama, tarii.
I’m happy to say we agreed almost entirely.	Guutummaatti jechuun ni danda’ama irratti walii galle jechuu kootti gammadeera.
That’s just one thing.	Sun waan tokko qofa.
What he needs now is help.	Amma wanti isa barbaachisu gargaarsa dha.
He should know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qaba.
You had a very good life.	Jireenya baayyee gaarii qabda turte.
After you, things will be what they are.	Si booda wanti jiru waan ta'u ta'a.
We have to leave her alone.	Ishee dhiisuu qabna.
No one knew where he had gone.	Eessa akka deeme namni beeku hin turre.
It wasn’t me.	Ana hin turre.
He was a boy.	Inni gurbaa ture.
There was something different about her.	Waa'ee ishee wanti adda ta'e tokko ture.
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
He saw me a week before everything he did.	Waan hojjete hundumaa dura torban tokko dura na arge.
But it happened.	Garuu ni ta'e.
I was sure it was something else.	Waan biraa akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa ture.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
This is the reality.	Wanti dhugaa jiru kana.
So he did his work there.	Kanaaf hojii isaa achitti hojjete.
Maybe he didn't even realize it at the time.	Tarii yeroo sanatti illee hin hubanne ta'a.
In the situation.	Haala keessa.
This just wasn’t right.	Kun sirrii hin turre qofa.
As it should, of course, be in time.	Akkuma ta’uu qabu, beekamaadha, yeroon.
This seemed very important.	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa fakkaata ture.
But everyone else knows.	Garuu namni biraa hundi ni beeka.
She would have done nothing now.	Silaa amma homaa hin gootu turte.
This is not how it should go.	Kun akkasitti deemuu hin qabu.
He was there just as she said.	Akkuma isheen jette achi ture.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
He didn't do it very often.	Yeroo baay'ee hin godhu ture.
It was one thing too many.	Waan tokko ture garmalee baay'ee.
That's what I love most about it.	Wanti ani isa keessaa baay'ee jaalladhu kanuma.
A sleeping teacher.'	Barsiisaa hirriba keessa jiru’ jedheen.
This whole thing started happening.	Wanti kun hundi ta'uu jalqabe.
Everything is so clear.	Wanti hundi akkas ifaadha.
It was going to be a long, long day.	Guyyaa dheeraa fi dheeraa ta'uuf ture.
I don't know what it was.	Maal akka ture hin beeku.
Now, you know better than to do that.	Amma, akkas gochuu caalaa ati beekta.
I have feelings for you.	Miira siif qaba.
It won't be long now.	Amma dheeraa hin ta'u.
It's just too much.	Garmalee qofa.
There was no one else around.	Naannoo sanatti namni biraa hin turre.
We can't be together.	Waliin ta'uu hin dandeenyu.
He wanted to know where it could be.	Eessa ta'uu akka danda'u beekuu barbaade.
But they have to be.	Garuu ta'uu qabu.
in.	keessa.
But he was good.	Inni garuu gaarii ture.
Opportunity is with us today.	Carraan har'a nu waliin jira.
It didn’t work very well for me.	Baayyee naaf hin hojjenne.
I hope I can help.	Gargaaruu akkan danda'u abdiin qaba.
No one told me about it.	Namni waa'ee kanaa natti hime hin jiru.
We got together.	Waliin galle.
That’s a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii dha.
I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it.	Waan gochuu dandeenyu waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
It didn’t last long though.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre garuu.
Maybe no one does.	Tarii namni godhu hin jiru.
Everything was new.	Wanti hundi haaraa ture.
They are right here.	Isaan sirriitti as jiru.
So it's not good to go about it.	Kanaaf waa'ee isaa deemuun gaarii miti.
Now I'm sure.	Amma mirkanaa'aa ta'e.
He doesn't think it's a good thing.	Waan gaarii itti hin fakkaatu.
I think it's right.	Sirrii natti fakkaata.
Now, wait.	Amma, eegaa.
It’s not easy, not really.	Salphaa miti, dhuguma miti.
That was a good idea.	Sun yaada gaarii ture.
What do you think we should do?.	Maal gochuu qabna jettanii yaaddu?.
Most people say it's good.	Namoonni baay'een gaarii dha jedhu.
I know he will do it.	Akka inni godhu nan beeka.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
They love you.	Si jaallatu.
You don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabdu.
It seemed like a long way.	Karaa dheeraa fakkaata ture.
I don't know why this is.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
It was a joke.	Qoosaa ture.
But that was never going to happen.	Garuu sun gonkumaa ta'uuf hin turre.
But I wasn't in it.	Ani garuu keessa hin turre.
I wonder what will happen.	Maaltu ta'a jedheen yaada.
It all went pretty well though.	Hundi isaa garuu baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme.
But sometimes there is.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko ni jira.
It would have been a good day.	Silaa guyyaa gaarii ta'a ture.
Three of your years.	Waggaa keessan keessaa sadii.
Perhaps it came from someone else.	Tarii nama biraa irraa dhufe taʼa.
That’s how it’s always been.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
That’s not clear.	Sun ifa miti.
He didn't speak.	Hin dubbanne.
She should have done it, she should have been.	Silaa gochuu qabdi turte, ta'uu qabdi turte.
It was being with his mother.	Haadha isaa waliin ta'uu ture.
I went outside.	Anis ala ba'e.
You are absolutely right about everything.	Waan hundumaa irratti guutummaatti sirrii dha.
I hope it helps you.	Akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
It will be a great night.	Halkan guddaa ta'a.
Then we had two.	Sana booda lama qabna turre.
He is watching us.	Nu ilaalaa jira.
I'm really.	Ani dhuguma.
Now I'm not so sure.	Amma akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
It’s not that bad.	Hamma kana hamaa miti.
I don't understand that.	Sana naaf hin galle.
Maybe they were, a little.	Tarii isaan turan, xiqqoo.
I can’t go back there anymore.	Kana booda achitti deebi’uu hin danda’u.
He lives there now.	Amma achi jiraata.
The simpler you make it, the better.	Salphaa yoo goote gaarii ta'a.
But it’s not just her missed opportunity.	Garuu carraan ishee darbe qofa miti.
That couldn't have happened.	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I don’t know what to think of him now.	Amma maal akkan isa yaadu hin beeku.
He may not know.	Inni beekuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
It didn't happen today.	Har'a hin taane.
You have to have friends.	Hiriyyoota qabaachuu qabda.
But what happened last week is not the way.	Torban darbe wanti ta'e garuu karaa miti.
Nothing else works.	Wanti biraa hin hojjetu.
She needs to get that.	Sana argachuu qabdi.
Then it has to go a different way.	Sana booda karaa adda ta'e irra deemuu qaba.
We just have to do our job.	Hojii keenya hojjechuu qofa qabna.
She must be alone in this big house, alone.	Mana guddaa kana keessatti kophaa ishee ta'uu qabdi, kophaa ishee ta'uu qabdi.
But he certainly couldn’t stay.	Garuu turuu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
I wanted to know more.	Caalaatti beekuu barbaade.
The things she said.	Wantoota isheen jette.
Only, it wasn’t hers.	Qofa, kan ishee hin turre.
To work with her.	Ishee waliin hojjechuuf.
She was extremely lonely.	Isheen garmalee kophaa taate turte.
He wasn’t on his own.	Inni ofii isaatiin hin turre.
Maybe, if things go right.	Tarii, yoo wanti tokko sirriitti deeme.
Tell me about that.	Waa'ee sanaa natti himi.
I think you know that.	Kana waan beektu natti fakkaata.
But he didn't want that.	Kana garuu hin barbaanne.
He knew many people.	Namoota hedduu beeka ture.
You have to live life.	Jireenya jiraachuu qabda.
I only saw him one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa isa arge.
I just didn’t have the space.	Bakka sana qofa hin qabu ture.
They are at home.	Mana jiru.
They have no hope.	Abdii hin qaban.
Now I have them.	Amma isaan qaba.
I looked at him.	Anis isa ilaale.
But that’s life.	Garuu sun jireenya.
But you, you are different.	Ati garuu, ati adda.
It has a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa qaba.
It will be inevitable.	Kan hin oolle ni ta'a.
What else do you need?.	Kan biraa maaltu si barbaachisa?.
But it still looks pretty great.	Garuu ammas baayyee guddaa fakkaata.
More than one.	Tokko ol.
He just wanted me.	Ana qofa barbaade.
Must be good luck.	Carraa gaarii ta'uu qaba.
It looks worse than it is.	Kan jiru caalaa hamaa fakkaata.
But at the time, it was fine.	Garuu yeroo sanatti, gaarii ture.
And I was getting good at it.	Anis itti gaarii ta'aa ture.
It happened both ways.	Karaa lamaan ta'e.
They still have everything.	Ammas waan hundumaa qabu.
Most of the time you don't need to do anything.	Yeroo baay'ee homaa gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
Whoever said that was more than right.	Kan kana jedhe sirrii caalaa ture.
I was very pleased with this.	Kanaan baay'een gammade.
I want to know what he knows.	Waan inni beeku beekuu barbaada.
But he knew it was more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa akka ta'e beeka ture.
We need to work harder.	Caalaatti hojjechuu qabna.
But it was the right thing to do.	Garuu waan sirrii ture.
But just now I didn’t.	Garuu amma qofa ani hin goone.
But at the time that was not a possibility.	Garuu yeroo sanatti sun waan ta'uu danda'u hin turre.
I don't mean it.	Jechuu koo miti.
This was a good reason.	Kun sababa gaarii ture.
If not, however.	Yoo hin taane garuu.
It’s just a good thing.	Waan gaarii qofa.
She didn’t have him.	Isheen isa hin qabdu turte.
It would never have been enough.	Silaa gonkumaa gahaa hin ta'u ture.
That wasn’t right.	Sun sirrii hin turre.
So good, so good.	Akkas gaarii, akkas gaarii.
We had done it.	Hojjenne turre.
But lucky for you, you can't get anything.	Garuu carraa siif ta'ee homaa argachuu hin dandeessu.
Everything was bad.	Wanti hundi hamaa ture.
That is often the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas taʼa.
I want a lot more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee barbaada.
You two go.	Isin lamaan deemtu.
Not sure they have names.	Maqaa akka qaban mirkanaa'aa miti.
To some extent it sometimes does.	Hamma tokko yeroo tokko tokko ni ta’a.
It must be about that.	Waa'ee sanaa ta'uu qaba.
Perhaps, he was right.	Tarii, sirrii ture.
Then he thought about it.	Sana booda itti yaade.
It may be, it may not be.	Ta'uu danda'a, ta'uu hin danda'u.
I really don't know.	Dhuguma hin beeku.
Maybe it will be great.	Tarii guddaa ta'a.
They want to do their job.	Hojii isaanii hojjechuu barbaadu.
Everything seemed different.	Wanti hundi adda fakkaata ture.
He was very happy.	Baay'ee gammade.
If you don't, you know what happens.	Yoo kana hin goone maal akka ta'u beekta.
It’s really nothing.	Dhuguma homaa miti.
A lot of times.	Yeroo baay'ee baay'ee.
That wants to be him.	Sun isa ta'uu barbaada.
Everything he did was new.	Wanti inni hojjete hundi haaraa ture.
I don't think he can.	Kan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu.
He had his man.	Nama isaa qaba ture.
Maybe not friends.	Tarii hiriyyoota miti.
You know how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu ni beekta.
No problem, really.	Rakkoo hin qabu, dhuguma.
I can do that now.	Amma sana gochuu nan dandaʼa.
In this way,	Haala kanaan, .
I have my people outside	Ani namoota koo ala qaba
He was no longer human	Kana booda nama hin turre
You couldn't do it.	Ati gochuu hin dandeenye.
I didn't know what was going to happen.	Waan ta'u hin beeku ture.
They’re just ideas.	Isaan yaada qofa.
I’m still working on that.	Ammas sana irratti hojjechaa jira.
You know where it is.	Eessa akka jiru ni beektu.
I wouldn’t have done that to you	Silaa waan akkasii si hin godhu ture
I know the place.	Bakka sana nan beeka.
He's got enough.	Inni waan gahaa ta'e qaba.
Not as it is now.	Akka amma jiru miti.
I could do it too.	Anis gochuu nan danda'a ture.
I'd rather not know.	Osoo hin beekne naaf wayya.
So you can buy it.	Kanaaf bitachuu dandeessu.
There just aren't many there.	Baay'een achi hin jiru qofa.
This time it worked.	Yeroo kana hojjete.
I was a good guy.	Ani gurbaa gaarii ture.
They're happening now.	Amma ta'aa jiru.
Then it’s just him and his mother.	Sana booda isaa fi haadha isaa qofa.
It's exactly right.	Sirriitti sirrii dha.
One of your own.	Kan keessan keessaa tokko.
They hadn’t met before.	Kanaan dura wal hin argine turan.
I am willing to do it	Anis gochuuf fedhii qaba
Lots of emotions.	Miira baay'ee.
We were good then.	Yeroo sana gaarii taane.
I knew everything about him	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa nan beeka ture
It may not even matter to you.	Siif illee barbaachisaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
My twins are identical.	Lamaan koo kan wal fakkaatu.
I knew he was a real person	Nama dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture
I mean really really good	Dhuguma dhuguma gaarii jechuu kooti
It's more about us than they are.	Isaan caalaa waa'ee keenya.
Love it so much.	Baay'ee jaalladhu.
Once he saw her.	Yeroo tokko ishee arge.
But people don’t seem to do that.	Garuu namoonni akkas waan hin goone fakkaata.
But that's about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa kanuma.
I hope you will forgive me	Dhiifama akka naaf gootu abdiin qaba
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
There will be one.	Tokko ni jiraata.
I hadn't realized it was this week	Torban kana akka ta'e hin hubanne ture
I’m not that simple.	Ani akkas salphaa miti.
I'm a girl.	Ani intala.
He is exceptional in just being so good at not being exceptional.	Inni adda ta'uu dhiisuu irratti akkas gaarii ta'uu qofa keessatti adda.
It can be very good.	Baayyee gaarii ta’uu danda’a.
A new promise.	Waadaa haaraa.
I know everything that goes on here	Waan asitti deemu hunda nan beeka
Later I saw another guy doing the same thing	Booda gurbaa biraa kanuma hojjechaa jiru arge
At the same time.	Kanuma waliin.
They all want you.	Hundi isaanii si barbaadu.
No one is above this.	Namni kanaa ol hin jiru.
And she did it again.	Ammas akkas goote.
Not so last year.	Waggaa darbe akkas miti.
Which there is no reason for.	Kan sababni hin jirre.
I can't go back to my father	Gara abbaa kootti deebi'uu hin danda'u
We’re going to make everything work.	Waan hunda akka hojjetu gochuuf jirra.
It was no longer his dog.	Kana booda saree isaa hin turre.
I went through a wide range of emotions	Miira bal'aa keessa darbe
He didn’t do it, you know.	Inni hin hojjenne beekta.
I don’t mean this entirely	Guutummaatti kana jechuu koo miti
You have to help me.	Na gargaaruu qabda.
I have it here in my book	Kitaaba koo keessatti asitti qaba
It really told me something.	Dhuguma waan tokko natti hime.
It certainly does for me.	Naaf akka godhu beekamaadha.
Just like you.	Akkuma kee.
But I didn't think it would happen	Ani garuu ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
I want to talk about you	Waa'ee kee dubbachuu barbaada
But she was very much like that.	Garuu isheen baayyee akkas turte.
Something that couldn’t live here	Wanti asitti jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I thought it would be easy	Salphaa ta'a jedheen yaade
In it, they.	Isa keessa, isaan.
Tell me what you know.	Waan beektu natti himi.
I think we are different	Nuti adda taane natti fakkaata
It doesn't matter who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
Many of us were like that	Baay'een keenya akkas turre
I hesitated for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf duubatti jedheen ture
Now our chance will never come.	Amma carraan keenya yoomiyyuu hin dhufu.
You can still do it.	Ammas gochuu dandeessa.
I didn’t know any better at the time	Yeroo sanatti kana caalaa hin beeku ture
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
I really didn’t want to see him	Dhuguma isa arguu hin barbaanne
I didn’t know my father	Abbaa koo hin beeku ture
She wasn’t going to do anything.	Isheen homaa gochuuf hin turre.
It just happened on the spot.	Bakka sanatti qofa ta'e.
It was a great job.	Hojii guddaa ture.
I know you don’t mean that	Akkas jechuu kee akka hin taane nan beeka
They should work well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechuu qabu.
I didn’t want to know more	Kana caalaa beekuu hin barbaanne
I couldn’t find the answer for you	Deebii isaa siif argachuu hin dandeenye
They could have gone.	Silaa deemuu danda'u turan.
I still don’t really.	Ammallee dhuguma hin godhu.
Maybe that wasn't a bad thing, he thought.	Tarii sun waan hamaa miti jedhee yaade.
But she knew nothing.	Isheen garuu homaa hin beektu turte.
They need to know how it happened, what happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e, maaltu akka ta'e beekuu qabu.
I'll be alone.	Kophaa koo ta'a.
A lot of issues.	Dhimma baay'ee.
I don’t know who started this	Kana eenyu akka jalqabe hin beeku
I spoke nothing but him, I thought nothing but him.	Isa malee homaa hin dubbanne, isa malee homaa hin yaadne.
I wonder where we are	Eessa jirra jedheen yaada
It’s not without reason.	Sababa hin qabne miti.
He says it was just luck.	Carraa qofa ture jedha.
What happened was very different.	Wanti ta'e garuu baayyee adda ture.
It would have been all she did.	Silaa waan isheen gootu qofa ture.
You said your part.	Ati kutaa kee jette.
I don’t want that life.	Jireenya sana hin barbaadu.
You didn’t have him though, you know.	Ati garuu isa hin qabdu turte beekta.
I just loved being with her	Ishee wajjin taʼuu qofa nan jaalladha ture
I never want to know	Ani gonkumaa beekuu hin barbaadu
You were the only one.	Ati qofa turte.
It must just be luck.	Carraa qofa ta'uu qaba.
It's just what happened.	Waan ta'e qofa.
The work of his hands.	Hojii harka isaa.
I think we’re on the right track now	Amma karaa sirrii irra jirra jedheen yaada
No one got it.	Namni argate hin jiru.
Two two two.	Lama lama lama.
He wasn’t there.	Inni hin jiru ture.
But you really should come with us.	Garuu dhuguma nu waliin dhufuu qabda.
I didn’t really care	Ani dhuguma dhimma hin qabu ture
I know it wasn’t.	Akka hin turre nan beeka.
I didn’t know what to do now	Amma maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
Then, apparently.	Sana booda, fakkaata.
That’s what they are.	Kanuma jiru.
I know there’s more to it than that.	Kana caalaa akka jiru nan beeka.
I made it work for him	Akka itti hojjetu nan godhe
It’s absolutely nothing.	Guutummaatti homaa miti.
As he does.	Akkuma inni godhu.
I would do it.	Ani nan godha ture.
But it never works.	Garuu gonkumaa hin hojjetu.
We talked at length.	Dheeraa dubbanne.
I really like that guy	Gurbaa sana baay'een jaalladha
On the same token.	Kanuma irratti.
I know nothing in this area.	Naannoo kana keessatti homaa hin beeku.
I think they are doing that right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana akkas gochaa jiru jedheen yaada.
I'm still not sure.	Ammallee mirkanaa'aa miti.
It was clear today.	Har'a ifa ture.
She had nowhere else to go.	Bakka biraa deemtu hin qabdu turte.
He can see it, but he can't get it right.	Inni arguu danda'a, garuu sirriitti argachuu hin danda'u.
I want to have a job	Hojii qabaachuu barbaada
There is nothing more dangerous.	Kana caalaa wanti balaa qabu hin jiru.
It’s just her.	Ishee qofa.
Let's think about it.	Mee itti yaadu.
I told him everything about you	Waa'ee kee waan hundumaa itti hime
I didn’t understand any jokes	Qoosaa tokkollee hin hubanne
That doesn't matter.	Sun homaa hin qabu.
I told him the truth	Dhugaa jiru itti hime
I still don’t know my surroundings	Ammallee naannoo koo hin beeku
I think it will work.	Ni hojjeta jedheen yaada.
It just seems so real.	Waan akkas dhugaa ta'e qofa fakkaata.
He should have known.	Silaa beekuu qaba ture.
I thought you would love to see him.	Isa arguu ni jaallattu jedheen yaade.
She wasn't sure what to do now	Amma maal akka gootu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
But he's probably as funny as everyone else.	Garuu tarii akkuma nama hundumaa qoosaa ta'uu hin oolu.
It was only two nights	Halkan lama qofa ture
Two things were true.	Wanti lama dhugaa ture.
I can't be alone with him	Isa waliin kophaa ta'uu hin danda'u
I hadn’t really thought about it at all	Dhuguma tasumaa hin yaadne ture
Now, three weeks later, he is still gone.	Amma torban sadii booda ammallee hin jiru.
This will be one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko ta’ee ni ta’a.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
Not a great deal of time, but some.	Yeroo guddaa miti, garuu tokko tokko.
I want to know if it works	Hojjechuu isaa beekuu barbaada
These two had that.	Isaan kun lamaan sana qaban turan.
I really hope it helps	Dhuguma akka inni na gargaaru abdiin qaba
He was trying to be good	Gaarii ta'uuf yaalaa ture
I don't think she is.	Isheen akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
But I love it.	Ani garuu nan jaalladha.
This is certainly not an entirely new idea.	Kun yaada guutummaatti haaraa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But I couldn't afford it	Ani garuu qarshii isaa hin dandeenye
I was expecting trouble	Rakkoo eegaa ture
That's what it's supposed to be.	Sun ta'uu qaba.
It wasn’t exactly a feeling.	Sirriitti miira hin turre.
I didn’t make him do it	Ani akka inni godhu hin goone
Everyone inside knows it, everyone outside knows it.	Namni keessa jiru hundi ni beeka, namni ala jiru hundi ni beeka.
She was going the other way.	Karaa biraa deemaa turte.
I didn't know all that about him	Waa'ee isaa kana hunda hin beeku ture
No one wants you here.	Asitti namni si barbaadu hin jiru.
He didn’t have that time	Yeroo sana hin qabu ture
Now we have a lot of things.	Amma waan baay'ee qabna.
I knew then what he was doing	Yeroo sanatti maal akka hojjetu nan beeka ture
That’s exactly it.	Guutummaatti kanuma.
But it is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa garuu miti.
But still, it exists.	Garuu ammas, ni jira.
To make it happen again.	Ammas akka ta'u gochuuf.
He wanted to apologize	Dhiifama gaafachuu barbaade
Now, it’s no longer in question.	Amma, kana booda gaaffii keessa hin jiru.
But, that doesn’t mean anything.	Garuu, sun homaa jechuu miti.
It was just bad.	Hamaa qofa ture.
I just couldn’t leave her	Ishee dhiisuu qofa hin dandeenye
But he couldn't do it.	Garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
Something wrong there.	Waan tokko achitti dogoggora.
I saw he was teaching you something	Waan tokko akka si barsiisaa jiru arge
That wouldn't be good.	Sun gaarii hin ta'u.
I didn't understand anything about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa naaf hin galle
They had a lot of money at the time.	Yeroo sanatti qarshii baayʼee qabu turan.
They are nothing like that.	Isaan waan akkasii miti.
I don’t have to say home	Mana jechuu hin qabu
Someone else said that.	Namni biraa akkas jedhe.
I was him once and soon will be me.	Ani yeroo tokko isa ture yeroo dhiyootti ana ta'a.
I just had something in my eyes, that’s all	Ija koo keessa waan tokko qofa qaba ture, kana qofa
Please, friends.	Mee hiriyyoota.
It could not have been otherwise.	Silaa akkas ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I couldn’t believe he was going through all the trouble	Rakkoo hunda keessa akka deemu amanuu hin dandeenye
Time came, time passed.	Yeroon dhufe, yeroon darbe.
But things didn’t go right.	Garuu wanti sirriitti deeme hin turre.
Good luck out there!.	Carraa gaarii achi keessaa!.
You know what you look like.	Maal akka fakkaattu ni beekta.
I just want to do what's right for you	Waan siif ta'u qofa hojjechuu barbaada
No one needs to know.	Namni beekuu hin barbaachisu.
It feels better than that	Kana caalaa miira qaba
He didn’t have the answer	Deebii isaa hin qabu ture
I am doing what he wants	Ani waan inni barbaadu hojjechaa jira
I thought I thought it	Natti fakkaate natti fakkaate
I hope someone is there	Namni achi akka jiru abdiin qaba
This is not a chance.	Kun carraa miti.
Reasonable, but incorrect.	Sababa kan qabu, garuu sirrii miti.
He is still there.	Ammallee achi jira.
This is fascinating.	Kun namatti tola.
You will know then.	Yeroo sanatti ni beekta.
You know this now.	Kana amma beekta.
I didn’t tell him everything	Waan hundumaa itti hin himne
It certainly didn’t meet my eye.	Ija kootti akka wal hin argine beekamaadha.
I may not know today	Har'a beekuu dhiisuu danda'a
I was nothing.	Ani homaa hin turre.
I think it’s my way	Karaa kooti natti fakkaata
It's still good.	Ammallee gaarii dha.
I want you to get to know him	Akka ati isa beektu nan barbaada
I think it was two years ago now.	Waggaa lama dura ture amma natti fakkaata.
Just like anything else.	Akkuma waan biraa.
I shouldn't have asked you right now	Yeroo ammaa kana si gaafachuu hin qabu ture
He did so reluctantly.	Fedhii malee akkas godhe.
That can only mean one thing.	Sun waan tokko qofa jechuu danda’a.
I didn’t always want kids	Yeroo hundumaa ijoollee hin barbaadu ture
She was still a little girl	Ammas intala xiqqoo ture
It will be a great watch.	Sa'aatii guddaa ta'a.
I hope he's not home now	Amma mana akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
You may not get it.	Argachuu dhiisuu dandeessa.
There were no children.	Ijoollee hin turre.
You have to give what you have.	Waan qabdu kennuu qabda.
I can't see it.	Arguu hin danda'u.
I thought of my children.	Ijoollee koo nan yaade.
I am very happy.	Ani baayyee gammadeera.
I wasn’t his problem but he made me his problem	Ani rakkoo isaa hin turre garuu inni rakkoo isaa na godhe
I don’t know where the problem lies.	Rakkoon jiru eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
He said that he was.	Jedhe akka ture.
But really good people.	Garuu dhuguma namoota gaarii.
I told him that was the one right there.	Anis inni sirriitti achi jiru sun akka ta'e itti hime.
I think it was obvious	Ifa ture natti fakkaata
You know something.	Waan tokko ni beekta.
I mean, they used to be	Duraan akka turan jechuu kooti
I think people have always been human	Namoonni yeroo hundumaa nama turan jedheen yaada
That, of course, is certainly not necessary.	Sun, beekamaadha, barbaachisaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I couldn’t help but ask a little question	Gaaffii xiqqoo tokko gaafachuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I love money.	Maallaqa nan jaalladha.
It was too big for me.	Baayyee guddaa naaf ture.
It was still good.	Ammas gaarii ture.
Everyone really enjoyed the food.	Namni hundi nyaata sanatti baay'ee gammade.
But I never do it.	Ani garuu gonkumaa hin godhu.
I thought it was my mother	Haadha koo natti fakkaate
I can't say anything	Homaa jechuu hin danda'u
I am a husband and father	Ani abbaa manaa fi abbaa dha
This doesn't need to happen.	Kun ta'uu hin barbaachisu.
I mean, look at the situation.	Haala jiru ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
There is no problem with this.	Kana irratti rakkoon hin jiru.
I’m not really like that .	Ani dhuguma akkas miti .
That's how you do it.	Akkasitti gootu.
Having the same name.	Maqaa wal fakkaatu qabaachuu.
I shouldn’t have gone	Silaa deemuu hin qabu ture
You can get yours.	Kee argachuu ni dandeessaa.
I doubt it, but maybe	Ani nan shakka, garuu tarii
They want to know what to do.	Waan gochuu qaban beekuu barbaadu.
A real guy.	Gurbaa dhugaa.
We have everything here.	Waan hunda asitti qabna.
I still don't understand	Ammallee naaf hin galle
All but one of them.	Hundi isaanii tokko malee.
It looks like that.	Akkas fakkaata.
I want to be very clear, here	Baayyee ifa ta'uu barbaada, asitti
He would have liked to ask him a few things.	Silaa waan muraasa isa gaafachuu ni jaallata ture.
But we had each other.	Garuu wal qabna turre.
I love it here	Asitti baay'een jaalladha
I think he was on to something	Waan tokko irra ture natti fakkaata
I quickly went to my house.	Dafee gara mana kootti deeme.
I wasn't sure she had been here before	Kanaan dura as akka turte mirkanaa'aa hin turre
He thought about the house	Waa'ee manaa yaade
But you need to go.	Garuu deemuun si barbaachisa.
Always a few hours.	Yeroo hundumaa sa’aatii muraasa.
She didn’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beektu turte.
That's what he said.	Kana jedhe.
I should give you this	Kana siif kennuu qaba
I wasn't so sure now.	Amma akkasitti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It just has to be itself	Of ta'uu qofa qaba
I couldn’t meet my friends	Hiriyyoota koo wajjin wal arguu hin dandeenye
I didn’t even notice the eyes	Ija sana illee hin hubanne
I thought about it	Anis itti yaade .
I shouldn't talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin qabu.
I want you here with me	Asitti na waliin si barbaada
I couldn’t tell you how many times	Yeroo meeqa sitti himuu hin dandeenye
I was the only person there	Nama achi jiru ana qofa ture
I didn't see the one that came out	Kan ba'e hin argine
I had no one to help me	Nama na gargaaru hin qabu ture
They want to know where you’ve been.	Bakka ati turte beekuu barbaadu.
I can't say anything more	Kana caalaa homaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
I thought to myself I was extremely lucky	Garmalee carraa qaba jedheen ofitti fakkaate
Just like my life exactly.	Akkuma jireenya koo sirriitti.
But that’s not why we did it.	Garuu kanaaf miti kan goone.
Didn't want trouble, really.	Rakkoo hin barbaanne, dhuguma.
You have to know Him.	Isa beekuu qabda.
I thought you were the one who went through it	Kan keessa darbe si natti fakkaate
Didn't catch it very well	Baay'ee gaarii hin qabne
It looks like a completely different house.	Mana guutummaatti adda ta'e fakkaata.
It shouldn’t matter, really.	Dhimma qabaachuu hin qabu, dhuguma.
From the one who doesn’t have it.	Isa hin qabne irraa.
There was no problem.	Rakkoon jiru hin turre.
It's not like he wanted it to be.	Akka ta'uu barbaade miti.
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
I never want to see her again	Kana booda gonkumaa ishee arguu hin barbaadu
Said.	Jedhe.
I wasn't sure about any of it	Waa'ee tokkollee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Absent in her life	Jireenya ishee keessatti kan hin turre
None of us are there.	Tokkollee keenya hin jiru.
I just can't see her like that.	Akkasitti ishee arguu qofa hin danda'u.
I am here, with you now	Ani as jira, amma si waliin
I didn’t know you knew him	Akka ati isa beektu hin beeku ture
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.	Tarii waan qabaachuu hin qabne arge ta'a.
I can't say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin danda'u.
Not great, but good.	Guddaa miti, gaarii malee.
But someone has to do it.	Garuu namni tokko gochuu qaba.
I still wasn't really sure why.	Ammallee maaliif akka ta'e dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But this one was different.	Inni kun garuu adda ture.
I just have to know what it is	Maal akka ta'e qofa beekuu qaba
Great food, great people and a good time.	Nyaata guddaa, namoota guddaa fi yeroo gaarii.
She was right.	Isheen sirrii turte.
I've had enough of that.	Sana gahaa ta'ee jira.
I didn't think about that	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne
I think they’re a good thing	Isaan waan gaarii natti fakkaata
Tell me what you like to eat the most.	Waan nyaachuu baay'ee jaallattu natti himi.
I won’t do this anymore.	Kana booda kana hin godhu.
It has to be, to be.	Ta'uu qaba, ta'uuf.
He knew who he was.	Eenyu akka ta'e ni beeka ture.
This is not a good place.	Kun bakka gaarii miti.
I mean the handle	Qabduu jechuu kooti
This is about me now.	Kun amma waa'ee kooti.
I wasn't sure at the time	Yeroo sanatti mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I need to make it happen this way	Akkasitti akka ta'u gochuun na barbaachisa
It’s a name.	Maqaa dha.
He didn’t want any of it.	Inni tokkollee hin barbaanne.
You just can’t see them.	Isaan arguu qofa hin dandeessu.
There would have been nothing you could have done.	Silaa wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
The problem is, they do.	Rakkoon jiru, ni godhu.
He gave it a great deal of thought.	Yaada guddaa itti kenne.
I knew it wouldn’t be an easy task	Hojii salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I love it though.	Ani garuu baay'een jaalladha.
I knew it had to happen	Ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture
Many of them are similar	Baay'een isaanii wal fakkaatu
He knew it could only be for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa ta’uu akka danda’u beeka ture.
I knew none of us were like that	Nu keessaa tokkollee akkas akka hin taane nan beeka ture
Try it today.	Har'a yaalaa.
I can’t seem to find my shoes though	Kophee koo garuu waanan argachuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
He knew this well.	Kana sirriitti beeka ture.
He is in such great trouble	Rakkoo guddaa akkasii keessa jira
I had better not go any further	Kana caalaa deemuu dhiisuu naaf wayya ture
That moment, that night.	Yeroo sana, halkan sana.
I wondered why that was	Maaliif akkas taʼe jedheen yaade
It is usually a very good time.	Yeroo baayyee yeroo baayyee gaarii dha.
Maybe just a little bit.	Tarii xiqqoo qofa.
We can’t do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
That will work.	Sun ni hojjeta.
He didn’t say anything for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf homaa hin dubbanne.
You know there is a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni akkas akka jiru ni beektu.
I still have a lot to tell you	Ammallee waan baay'een sitti himu qaba
That’s all he didn’t do for me	Kana qofa naaf hin goone
I thought we got along very well	Baayyee gaarii waliin walii galle natti fakkaate
Not a bad way, he thought.	Karaa hamaa miti jedhee yaade.
I'm pretty sure he did	Inni akka godhe mirkanaa'aa dha
But he didn’t do any of those things.	Garuu wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
No one knew where he was.	Eessa akka jiru namni beeku hin turre.
I have no idea what it is	Maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
This is not something you have.	Kun waan ati qabdu miti.
That’s exactly who he looks like.	Eenyu akka fakkaatu sirriitti kanuma.
Just tell me that.	Kana qofa natti himi.
You made it happen.	Ati akka ta'u goote.
All of this.	Kana hunda.
He doesn't love anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin jaallatu.
I hope that’s not the case anymore	Kana booda akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba
That could have happened.	Sun taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
This they right here.	Kun isaan sirriitti asitti.
He said some of these things on the spot.	Wantoota kana keessaa muraasa bakka sanatti dubbate.
He had nowhere else to go	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin qabu ture
I knew it was a mistake.	Dogoggora akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
Now they know better.	Amma caalaatti beeku.
I want to be both of them, absolutely.	Isaan lamaan ta'uu barbaada, guutummaatti.
It's going to happen.	Ta'uuf jira.
I didn't want to go back	Duubatti deebi'uu hin barbaanne
I didn’t expect things to go so badly	Wanti akkasitti hamaa deema jedhee hin yaadne
She did what she could.	Waan dandeessu goote.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
So that was a problem.	Kanaaf sun rakkoo ture.
We saw your parents in the room we did.	Warra kee kutaa nuti hojjenne keessatti argine.
Everything just works for me here.	Wanti hundi asitti naaf qofa hojjeta.
I was going to go.	Ani deemaa ture.
Otherwise you can just leave them there.	Yoo kana hin taane achitti isaan dhiisuu qofa dandeessa.
I know about everything.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa nan beeka.
Then it's not very good.	Sana booda baayyee gaarii miti.
He is with my mother.	Inni haadha koo waliin jira.
I think you’re absolutely fine	Ati guutummaatti gaarii natti fakkaata
He was a little excited.	Xiqqoo gammade.
He wants them	Isaan barbaada
I'm better there.	Ani achitti wayya.
That’s how good it is.	Akkasitti gaarii dha.
I was waiting for something to happen	Waan tokko ta'u eegaa ture
What happens after that .	Sana booda maaltu ta'a .
He had nothing to say	Waan jedhu hin qabu ture
No one knows everything about me.	Waa'ee koo waan hunda namni beeku hin jiru.
I didn’t want to live anymore	Kana booda jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I was always watching you	Yeroo hundumaa si ilaalaa ture
It is absolutely correct.	Guutummaatti sirrii dha.
I'm the only one.	Ani qofa.
I'll say this.	Kana nan jedha.
She is not doing her best.	Isheen waan dandeessu hunda hojjechaa hin jirtu.
I know exactly where she is.	Bakka isheen jirtu sirriitti beeka.
Not for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf osoo hin taane.
She is tall.	Isheen dheeraa dha.
That that was going to work.	Akka sun hojjechuuf ture.
I wasn’t there.	Ani hin turre.
He would have been a good father.	Silaa abbaa gaarii ta'a ture.
It was just one day of the week.	Torban keessaa guyyaa tokko qofa ture.
Over everything and nothing.	Waan hundumaa irra fi homaa hin taane.
All that stuff from the past.	Wantoota sana hunda kan durii irraa.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
There is no one to help you.	Namni si gargaaru hin jiru.
She really doesn’t care.	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabdu.
Like never ever.	Akka gonkumaa gonkumaa.
I'll be in soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti keessa jira.
But that shouldn't be the case, she said.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu jette.
He had nowhere to go	Bakka itti deemu hin qabu ture
People are different.	Namoonni adda.
I knew it was true as he knew it	Akkuma inni beeku dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture
But this time it wasn't necessary.	Yeroo kana garuu hin barbaachisu ture.
Just like in the house.	Akkuma mana keessaa.
And it was like that again.	Ammas akkas ture.
I didn’t want to do those things.	Wantoota sana gochuu hin barbaanne.
All you have to do is say it.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu jechuu qofa.
I never wanted it to happen in real life	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti akka ta'u gonkumaa hin barbaanne
You can’t see their eyes.	Ija isaanii arguu hin dandeessu.
It just has to work.	Hojjechuu qofa qaba.
Everything should be fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'uu qaba.
This is dangerous.	Kun balaa qaba.
I didn’t have time to tell you	Yeroon sitti himu hin qabu ture
But that wasn’t always the case	Yeroo hundumaa garuu akkas hin turre
None of this matters.	Kun tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
This is just my opinion.	Kun yaada koo qofa.
I would have thought of myself as alone	Silaa akkan kophaa kootti of yaada ture
I want to know how this all happens.	Kun hundi akkamitti akka ta'u beekuu barbaada.
Otherwise you are in serious danger.	Yoo kana hin taane balaa hamaa keessa jirta.
She couldn’t quite see it.	Isheen guutummaatti arguu hin dandeenye.
I didn't want to be alone with her	Ishee waliin kophaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
It just means he saw you great.	Inni waan guddaa si arge jechuu qofa.
It doesn't matter how or why.	Akkamitti fi maaliif akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
He should have asked.	Silaa gaafachuu qaba ture.
So far so good.	Hanga ammaatti akkas gaarii.
Take a good look at her.	Akka gaariitti ishee ilaalaa.
I really want to know	Ani baay'een beekuu barbaada
Maybe more than we have.	Tarii waan qabnu caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t even have to ask.	Gaafachuu illee hin qabu ture.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
Not always, but often.	Yeroo hundumaa osoo hin taane, yeroo baay’ee.
We have a guy.	Gurbaa qabna.
It might even be true.	Dhugaa illee ta'uu danda'a.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Garuu waan hin hojjenne fakkaata.
I have no idea what the problem is	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
I want to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu barbaada.
She wasn't here.	Isheen as hin turre.
I didn’t do that.	Ani akkas hin goone.
I couldn’t leave her.	Ishee dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
So you already know what time it is	Kanaaf sa'aatii meeqa akka ta'e duruu beekta
He would never be able to.	Inni gonkumaa hin danda'u ture.
I can't see it.	Arguu hin danda'u.
He hadn't helped much so far	Hanga ammaatti gargaarsa guddaa hin goone ture
I want to do them now	Amma isaan hojjechuu barbaada
It happens when you don't have it.	Yeroo ati hin qabne ta'a.
I know everything that happens around here	Waan naannoo asitti ta'u hunda nan beeka
I didn’t even know my real parents	Warra koo isa dhugaa illee hin beeku ture
This is completely wrong.	Kun guutummaatti dogoggora.
Not thinking.	Yaadu miti.
This is not easy.	Kun salphaa miti.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku, dhuguma.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
He just loves it here too much.	Asitti garmalee jaallata qofa.
I don’t know how he did it.	Akkamitti akka godhe hin beeku.
I had to make her mine again	Ammas kan koo ishee gochuun qaba ture
They love it there.	Achitti ni jaallatu.
I haven’t been able to do that yet	Hanga ammaatti akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
He is a must.	Inni dirqama.
She has something about us.	Waa'ee keenya waan tokko qabdi.
I can do so much more.	Kana caalaa baayʼee hojjechuu nan dandaʼa.
What is going to happen?.	Maaltu ta'uuf deema?.
He really needs to know what she is	Dhuguma maal akka taate beekuu qaba
He only has two hands	Harka lama qofa qaba
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
I know you are, obviously you are	Akka ati jirtu nan beeka, akka jirtu ifaadha
Rarely, it works.	Yeroo muraasaaf, ni hojjeta.
Our friends.	Hiriyyoota keenya.
I didn't do it today.	Har'a hin goone.
It wasn’t yours.	Kan kee hin turre.
We were bad.	Hamaa turre.
But he shouldn't.	Garuu gochuu hin qabu.
I ignored it right	Anis sirriitti bira darbe
It’s always in the same state.	Yeroo hunda haala tokko keessa jiraata.
But something had gone wrong.	Garuu wanti tokko dogoggora ta'ee ture.
I didn’t need it anymore.	Kana booda na hin barbaachifne.
One question perhaps.	Gaaffii tokko tarii.
I couldn’t do it for him	Isaaf gochuu hin dandeenye
I was one of these people.	Ani namoota kana keessaa tokko ture.
You always know what to do in the past.	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo darbe maal akka gootu beekta.
I wasn’t expecting this	Kana eegaa hin turre
The time was not now.	Yeroon amma hin turre.
It was from her mother.	Haadha ishee irraa ture.
He couldn’t have what he wanted.	Waan barbaade qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t have anything	Ani homaa hin qabu ture
She was to meet them both, here, tonight.	Isheen lamaan isaanii waliin wal arguu qabdi turte, asitti, halkan kana.
It seemed just the right one.	Kan sirrii ta'e qofa fakkaata ture.
But it still doesn’t work.	Garuu ammas hin hojjetu.
I don't really understand what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru dhuguma naaf hin galle
I knew she loved me	Akka isheen na jaallattu nan beeka ture
Maybe this is right.	Tarii kun sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
He is doing well with the house.	Mana waliin waan gaarii hojjechaa jira.
He wouldn’t have been anywhere else.	Silaa bakka biraa hin jiru ture.
I think she’s into it	Isheen keessa waan jirtu natti fakkaata
It doesn’t go away.	Hin deemu.
I didn’t want to see this	Kana arguu hin barbaanne
I think they are right	Isaan sirrii natti fakkaata
He was wrong about that.	Waa'ee kanaa dogoggora ture.
This is no longer a problem.	Kun kana booda rakkoo miti.
This is not true.	Kun dhugaa miti.
I didn't really think much of it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti dhuguma baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
I mean, no one noticed at all	Namni tokkollee tasumaa hin hubanne jechuu kooti
But I really knew nothing	Dhuguma garuu homaa hin beeku ture
He should know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qaba.
I am very, very, very sorry.	Ani baay'ee baay'ee baay'een dhiifama.
But everything went well.	Garuu wanti hundi akka gaariitti deeme.
Not just myself, but everyone.	Ofii koo qofa osoo hin taane, nama hunda.
I don't know if it is.	Ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
I know someone who can help	Nama gargaaruu danda'u nan beeka
It was more than I saw.	Ani arge caalaa ture.
So it’s not new.	Kanaaf haaraa miti.
It wasn’t his wife, it wasn’t his kids, it was me.	Haadha manaa isaa miti, ijoollee isaa miti, ana ture.
Just look inside.	Keessa ilaalaa qofa.
There's nothing in there for you.	Achi keessaa wanti siif ta'u hin jiru.
It does many other things.	Waan biraa hedduu hojjeta.
I want it to be wrong more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa dogoggora akka ta'u nan barbaada
I wasn’t a good girl for you either	Anis intala gaarii siif hin turre
It's been good and bad.	Gaarii fi hamaa ta'ee jira.
They must have food.	Nyaata qabaachuu qabu.
Which probably isn't much.	Kan tarii baay'ee hin taane.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I haven't seen many of them.	Baay'ee isaanii hin argine.
Slightly smaller, but still nice	Xiqqoo xiqqoo, garuu ammas namatti tola
I can't see why it would be any different now	Amma maaliif akka adda ta'u arguu hin danda'u
He had a lot of life.	Jireenya baay'ee qaba ture.
What could have been .	Silaa maaltu ta'uu danda'a ture .
Everything in this room.	Kutaa kana keessa waan hunda.
They know what’s coming.	Waan dhufu ni beeku.
I don’t understand any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee naaf hin galle
I can't tell any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee himuu hin danda'u.
Maybe someone knows her.	Tarii namni tokko ishee beeka ta'a.
He had a lot to do yesterday	Kaleessa waan baay'ee hojjechuu qaba ture
One, two, three of you.	Tokko, lama, sadii keessan.
Now he had it.	Amma qaba ture.
We have our hands full.	Harka keenya guutuu qabna.
So nothing happens.	Kanaaf wanti ta'u hin jiru.
I couldn’t help myself	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye
I saw you today.	Har'a si arge.
We just didn’t tell you.	Nuti qofa sitti hin himne.
This isn't much.	Kun baay'ee miti.
I know a lot of it	Baay'ee isaa nan beeka
I hadn't thought about that before	Kana dura waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne ture
In this way.	Akka kanaan.
I certainly have a probable cause	Sababni ta'uu danda'u akkan qabu beekamaadha
One of them went away.	Isaan keessaa tokko deeme.
I knew a girl from this area a long time ago	Intala naannoo kanaa tokko yeroo dheeraa dura beeka ture
But he already knew who was there.	Garuu eenyu akka achi jiru duruu beeka ture.
So far today was good.	Hanga ammaatti har'a gaarii ture.
No problem with that, good for you	Sana irratti rakkoo hin qabu, siif gaarii
Everything was great then and it's going great now.	Yeroo sanatti wanti hundi guddaa ture ammas guddaa ta'ee deemaa jira.
This is too much.	Kana garmalee.
On the new book.	Kitaaba haaraa irratti.
She did this.	Kana goote.
I wasn't sure where this was going	Kun eessa akka deemu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I am one of the lucky ones.	Ani warra carraa qaban keessaa tokko.
Many of them aren’t true.	Baay’een isaanii dhugaa miti.
She would never know.	Isheen gonkumaa hin beektu turte.
I can't tell you anything more	Kana caalaa homaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
No one has the opportunity to do that.	Namni carraa akkas gochuuf qabu hin jiru.
I didn’t know what else to tell him	Kan biraa maal akkan itti himu hin beeku ture
I began to see how things were with them.	Wanti akkamitti akka isaan bira jiru arguu jalqabe.
I wasn't sure what it was, but it was true.	Maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre, garuu dhugaa ture.
It was not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin turre.
But it mattered.	Garuu dhimma qaba ture.
It’s not an easy life.	Jireenya salphaa miti.
They love Him.	Isa jaallatu.
they must have.	qabaachuu qabu.
I wasn't sure what would happen at all	Waan ta'u tasumaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I would do what they wanted me to do	Na barbaadu nan godha ture
I think they’re the only two you know.	Isaan lamaan qofa kan ati beektu natti fakkaata.
I couldn’t eat right now	Yeroo ammaa kana nyaachuu hin dandeenye
I think he really likes it here.	Asitti dhuguma waan jaallatu natti fakkaata.
I think that would have been pretty neat	Silaa sun baayyee sirrii ture jedheen yaada
With all of you.	Keessan hunda keessan waliin.
He was one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko ture.
I couldn’t believe the time went by so quickly	Yeroon akkas dafee darbe jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I’d rather have kids	Ijoollee qabaachuu naaf wayya
I wonder what to do now	Amma maal godha jedheen yaada
I wish this had never happened	Osoo kun ta'ee hin beeku ta'ee natti tola
He may be onto something, he may not.	Inni waan tokko irra ta'uu danda'a, ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I told him it was my car	Konkolaataa koo akka ta'e itti hime
It's not just about tonight.	Waa'ee halkan kanaa qofa miti.
We are indeed.	Dhuguma jirra.
Look at her eyes.	Ija ishee ilaalaa.
I don't like that.	Ani akkas hin jaalladhu.
I want to stay here for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf as turuu barbaada
You are no different.	Ati adda miti.
Lots of light.	Ifa baay'ee.
They are like that.	Isaan akkas jiru.
I know you really like this guy	Gurbaa kana baay'ee akka jaallattu nan beeka
She has only one hand.	Harka tokko qofa qabdi.
But, this is the problem.	Garuu, rakkoon jiru kana.
Who knows though.	Eenyutu beeka garuu.
It has some buttons	Qabduu tokko tokko qaba
I couldn't tell him	Ani itti himuu hin dandeenye
He did really well.	Dhuguma waan gaarii hojjete.
I don’t think anyone even knew it was there	Namni achi akka jiru illee beeku natti hin fakkaatu
I’d rather play.	Taphachuu naaf wayya.
I like my job.	Hojii koo natti tola.
Then again, again.	Sana booda ammas, ammas.
It just seemed like a good idea.	Yaada gaarii qofa fakkaata ture.
I wondered where he was now	Amma eessa jira jedheen yaade
But it’s clearly more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa akka ta’e ifaadha.
I know it doesn’t work that way	Akkasitti akka hin hojjenne nan beeka
A job no one else could do.	Hojii namni biraa hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
Like eating good food.	Akkuma nyaata gaarii nyaachuu.
I wasn’t looking for this	Kana barbaadaa hin turre
I was the one who found her	Kan ishee argate ana ture
You knew what was going to happen.	Waan ta'u beekta turte.
Check them out here.	Isaan kana as ilaalaa.
He did that so well.	Sana akkas gaarii godhe.
That’s not what you want.	Kan ati barbaaddu kana miti.
I haven’t told anyone yet.	Hanga ammaatti namatti hin himne.
Then there was me.	Sana booda ani ture.
Something no one else knows.	Waan namni biraa hin beekne.
I can't see what it is	Maal akka ta'e arguu hin danda'u
It was from me.	Ana irraa ture.
Nothing, nothing.	Homaa, homaa miti.
One.	Tokko.
Last year it wasn’t.	Bara darbe hin turre.
I'm on it.	Ani irra jira.
I mean, ridiculous things	Waan qoosaa jechuu kooti
I knew the truth.	Dhugaa jiru nan beeka ture.
There are some people who do not understand this well.	Namoonni tokko tokko kana akka gaariitti hin hubanne jiru.
I met with them.	Isaan waliin wal arge.
I was no longer interested	Kana booda fedhii hin qabu ture
I saw you when you didn’t know	Yeroo ati hin beekne si arge
I mean, never talk about it again.	Kana booda gonkumaa waa'ee isaa akka hin dubbanne jechuu kooti.
I need you to do that for me, right now	Akkas akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa, yeroo ammaa kana
Your place of residence.	Bakka jireenya kee.
For this, however.	Kanaaf garuu.
That doesn’t mean it’s not true.	Kana jechuun dhugaa miti jechuu miti.
He took his time.	Yeroo isaa fudhate.
There was something not quite right about all of this.	Kana hunda keessa wanti guutummaatti sirrii hin taane tokko ture.
She was there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi turte.
Again, it works fine for me.	Ammas, gaarii naaf hojjeta.
I don’t know either of you guys.	Isin lamaan keessaa tokkollee hin beeku gurbaa.
It didn’t matter anymore	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu ture
We had to come back here	Asitti deebi'uu qabna turre
This was a man who worked for a living.	Kun nama jireenya isaaf hojjetu ture.
So, two questions.	Kanaaf, gaaffii lama.
I knew she wanted to come	Dhufuu akka barbaaddu nan beeka ture
I want to know what’s in it	Waan keessa jiru beekuu barbaada
And I was just there.	Anis achi qofa ture.
It obviously wasn’t working.	Hojjechaa akka hin turre ifaadha.
I want what she’s up to	Waan isheen irra jirtu nan barbaada
You never know what could happen.	Waan ta'uu danda'u gonkumaa hin beektu.
It just seemed like that.	Akkas qofa fakkaata ture.
They were always with her.	Yeroo hundumaa ishee waliin turan.
Too self-fulfilling.	Garmalee of guutuu.
I wasn’t good at all	Ani tasumaa gaarii hin turre
I know the dangers.	Balaa isaa nan beeka.
I didn’t want to work	Hojii hojjechuu hin barbaanne
This is not a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa miti.
You are a good person.	Ati nama gaarii dha.
I have a feeling we need your help	Gargaarsa keessan akka nu barbaachisu miira jedhu qaba
I haven’t seen them in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan hin argine
He wanted it to be a question	Gaaffii akka ta'u barbaade
She had to buy some time.	Yeroo muraasa bitachuu qabdi turte.
I didn't know her very well	Baay'ee ishee hin beeku ture
It wants to be different	Adda ta'uu barbaada
I thought about it for a moment	Yeroo muraasaaf jedheen yaade
I didn't know how to be a mother	Akkamitti akka haadha ta'u hin beeku ture
But he is right.	Garuu inni sirrii dha.
That was all he told us.	Inni nutti hime kana qofa ture.
This isn’t me.	Kun ana miti.
I had no idea what she meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaaddu yaada hin qabu ture
It wasn’t his idea.	Yaada isaa hin turre.
Maybe nothing happens.	Tarii wanti ta'u hin jiru ta'a.
No one knew what to say.	Namni maal akka jedhu hin beeku ture.
A lot of it, really.	Baay'ee isaa, dhuguma.
It just seems right	Sirrii qofa fakkaata
It may come back much later	Baay'ee booda deebi'uu danda'a
I have nothing to say on this matter	Dhimma kana irratti waanan jedhu hin qabu
This seemed like a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii fakkaata ture.
I love you both the most	Lamaan keessan hunda caalaa isin jaalladha
He thought about this question	Gaaffii kana irratti yaade
There was only one problem.	Rakkoon tokko qofa ture.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
Life is what it is.	Jireenya jechuun.
The problem there was entirely different.	Rakkoon achi ture guutummaatti adda ture.
I even love working there	Achitti hojjechuu illee nan jaalladha
Who can be here, he says	Eenyutu as jiraachuu danda'a jedha
I saw it through him.	Karaa isaatiin arge.
He loved to play.	Inni taphachuu ni jaallata ture.
I need you all	Hundi keessan isin barbaada
I'm just not great.	Ani garuu guddaa miti qofa.
I'll go with him tonight	Halkan kana isa waliin nan deema
Not even a name.	Maqaa illee miti.
That was the real problem.	Rakkoon dhugaa kanuma ture.
No one really knew what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru dhuguma namni beeku hin turre.
It had to be a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu qaba ture.
I love it so much	Ani baay'een jaalladha
I can't help it.	Ani gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I wondered what was inside	Keessa isaa maaltu jira jedheen yaade
I just couldn’t do it anymore	Kana booda gochuu qofa hin dandeenye
I don’t know what’s more real	Kana caalaa maaltu dhugaa akka ta’e hin beeku
It was my whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu ture.
I wanted to ask a favor	Tola tokko gaafachuu barbaade
He might not even know about it.	Waaʼee kanaa illee beekuu dhiisuu dandaʼa ture.
I didn't think about it that way	Akkasitti waa'ee isaa hin yaadne
It was a voice, nothing more.	Sagalee ture, kana caalaa homaa hin turre.
They might still want me.	Ammallee na barbaadu ta'a.
He wants to help.	Gargaaruu barbaada.
I’m not a bad person here	Ani asitti nama hamaa miti
I was the most important one	Ani isa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ture
I'm a duty.	Ani dirqama.
This is your business.	Kun dhimma keessan.
I have been there.	Ani achi tureera.
No unnecessary risks.	Balaa hin barbaachifne hin qabu.
It’s not what it seems.	Waan fakkaatu miti.
I know what you need most	Waan baay'ee si barbaachisu nan beeka
But there is no chance.	Garuu carraan hin jiru.
He didn't know how much but one thing was for sure.	Meeqa akka ta'e hin beekne garuu wanti tokko mirkanaa'aa ture.
A little goes a long way.	Xiqqoo karaa dheeraa deema.
He no longer looked like himself.	Kana booda of hin fakkaatu ture.
I couldn’t ask for more	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye
A little later	Xiqqoo booda .
Many of us were like that back then	Yeroo sanatti baay'een keenya akkas turre
So we need to see it.	Kanaaf arguu qabna.
It’s not like she’s leaving.	Isheen akka deemtu miti.
That’s what it was.	Kanuma ture.
He knew exactly what he was doing	Waan godhu sirriitti beeka ture
Nothing from your friends.	Hiriyyoota kee irraa homaa miti.
I didn’t want her to, not yet	Ani akka isheen gootu hin barbaanne, ammallee miti
I need it so much.	Baay'ee na barbaachisa.
Didn't see any major issues	Dhimma guddaa hin argine
He couldn’t do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
But maybe it's something else.	Garuu tarii waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
This was home, once upon a time.	Kun mana ture, yeroo tokko.
The work was great.	Hojiin sun guddaa ture.
In their long robes.	Uffata dheeraa isaanii keessatti.
I didn’t talk to anyone but my parents	Warra koo malee nama biraa waliin hin dubbanne
No one should ever know.	Namni tokkollee gonkumaa beekuu hin qabu.
I think you’ll love it.	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada.
Not until now.	Hanga ammaatti miti.
I couldn’t see anything.	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
They are the only ones.	Isaan qofa.
It's something you shouldn't do, but you don't know.	Waan gochuu hin qabne, garuu hin beekne ta'a.
Not quite, but not much more.	Guutummaatti miti, garuu kana caalaa baay'ee miti.
And he did so.	Akkas godhe.
That shouldn't have happened.	Silaa sun ta'uu hin qabu ture.
It’s really good.	Dhuguma gaarii dha.
It was a house.	Mana ture.
Another in her mouth.	Kan biraa afaan ishee keessaa.
He still loves her.	Ammallee ishee jaallata.
I don't know much about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan baay'ee hin beeku.
I just told you that	Akkas qofa sitti hime
We had space, lots of space.	Bakka qabna turre, bakka baay'ee qabna turre.
I couldn't do it now.	Amma gochuu hin dandeenye.
But things are not so bad here.	Garuu asitti wanti akkas hamaa miti.
I didn't really know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru dhuguma hin beeku ture
Only it wasn’t quite enough.	Qofa guutummaatti gahaa hin turre.
I don't think this is right	Kun sirrii natti hin fakkaatu
I knew it for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf beeka ture
Maybe it's true.	Tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
I know you want some	Tokko tokko akka barbaaddu nan beeka
They must be inside.	Keessa ta'uu qabu.
He's not in a bad place.	Bakka hamaa keessa hin jiru.
See that no one can do anything.	Namni homaa gochuu danda'u akka hin jirre ilaalaa.
Looks good, doesn't it.	Gaarii fakkaata mitiiree.
You will love her.	Ishee ni jaallattu.
I need to do the right thing	Waan sirrii taʼe gochuun na barbaachisa
He had other ideas.	Yaada biraa qaba ture.
None of them looked older.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee umuriin isaa ol ta’e hin fakkaatu ture.
My children have the same.	Ijoollee koo kan wal fakkaatu qabna.
He understood exactly.	Inni sirriitti hubate.
I could have gone.	Silaa deemuu nan danda'a ture.
This possibility needs to be more clear.	Carraan kun caalaatti ifa ta’uu qaba.
I’m still not quite sure what you’re thinking.	Ammas maal akka yaaddu sirriitti hin beeku.
I couldn't do anything	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
He wants a chance to play	Carraa taphachuu barbaada
I hadn't thought that was possible	Akkas ni danda'ama jedhee hin yaadne ture
That has never happened before.	Kana dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
Only she could have done that.	Silaa sana gochuu kan dandeessu ishee qofa ture.
I doubt we can get anything else out of her	Ishee irraa waan biraa argachuu akka dandeenyu nan shakka
It was never going to happen.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u hin turre.
That must be great.	Sun guddaa taʼuu qaba.
I’m still making them	Ammallee isaan hojjechaa jira
It was all mine.	Hundi isaa kan koo ture.
That’s how we did it.	Akkasitti hojjenne.
That’s an obvious mistake.	Sun dogoggora ifaadha.
So I’m glad to be here.	Kanaaf as jiraachuu kootti gammadeera.
But he is still with us.	Garuu ammallee nu waliin jira.
I should have asked you	Silaa si gaafachuu qaba ture
I wish he was here with me	Osoo as na waliin ta'ee natti tola
I couldn't tell enough of them	Isaan keessaa gahaa ta'ee himuu hin dandeenye
I still think about him	Ammallee waa'ee isaa nan yaada
To help you out.	Si gargaaruuf.
I am not one of them	Ani isaan keessaa tokko miti
Two things you can do a bit here.	Wantoota lama asitti xiqqoo hojjechuu dandeessu.
I really wanted to go	Deemu baay'een barbaade
Now I think it’s dangerous	Amma balaa qaba jedheen yaada
I had no idea where she was	Eessa akka jirtu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
That was easy enough.	Sun salphaa gahaa ture.
I still had no idea what to tell him.	Ammallee maal akkan itti himu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Just tell them what they need to know.	Waan beekuu qaban qofa itti himi.
Live.	Jiraachuu.
I hadn’t thought of it that way	Akkasitti hin yaadne ture
It’s nothing on its own.	Ofii isaatiin homaa miti.
It happened before that.	Sana dura ta'e.
I mean, giving you time	Yeroo siif kennuu jechuu kooti
But he had to get it right.	Garuu sirriitti argachuu qaba ture.
There was no reason to help them.	Sababni isaan gargaaru hin turre.
I mean, somebody had to do it.	Namni tokko gochuu qaba ture jechuu kooti.
A lot has been happening in these three weeks.	Torban sadii kana keessatti waan baay'een ta'aa tureera.
Now we have you.	Amma si qabna.
Maybe it's for him.	Tarii isaaf ta'uu danda'a.
I couldn’t live like that.	Akkas jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
We totally agreed.	Guutummaatti walii galle.
You don’t really want me.	Dhuguma na hin barbaaddu.
Home with interest.	Mana fedhii waliin.
But it is not clear.	Garuu ifa hin qabu.
He wanted to see her eyes	Ija ishee arguu barbaade
You know who you are, you know what you’ve done for me.	Eenyu akka taate ni beekta, waan naaf goote ni beekta.
You have me'.	Ati na qabda'.
They seem indifferent.	Isaan waan dhimma hin qabne fakkaata.
But she doesn't have it.	Isheen garuu hin qabdu.
I wish everything was so simple	Wanti hundi akkas salphaa ta'ee natti tola
A lot of people.	Nama baay'ee.
Not entirely sure	Guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti
I have a big problem with that	Sana irratti rakkoo guddaa qaba
I didn’t want that at all.	Ani tasumaa sana hin barbaanne.
It was an opportunity.	Carraa ture.
I was just looking at it	Ani qofa ilaalaa ture
Everything seemed so clear.	Wanti hundi akkas ifa fakkaata ture.
I wasn’t in the room.	Ani kutaa sana keessa hin turre.
I still didn’t know everyone.	Ammallee nama hunda hin beeku ture.
Really unlucky, one of those things.	Dhuguma carraa hin qabne, wantoota sana keessaa tokko.
It’s not a guy.	Gurbaa miti.
I didn’t want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne.
She doesn't need it.	Ishee hin barbaachisu.
Not sure of the name.	Maqaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
Many of them were drinking	Baay'een isaanii dhugaa turan
We need more than that	Kana caalaa nu barbaachisa
He thinks he knows everything.	Waan hundumaa waan beeku itti fakkaata.
I couldn’t have enough of him	Isa gahaa qabaachuu hin dandeenye
Love to see that.	Akka arguu jaalladhu.
They just didn’t have the money.	Maallaqa sana qofa hin qaban turan.
I just had something in my eyes	Ija koo keessa waan tokko qofa qaba ture
Tell me about it again.	Ammas waa'ee isaa natti himi.
Not so much.	Hamma kana miti.
Love how it looks on my hand.	Harka koo irratti akkamitti akka fakkaatu jaalladhu.
I certainly didn’t	Ani akkan hin goone beekamaadha
But she doesn't think so.	Isheen garuu akkas hin yaaddu.
Indeed, she was.	Dhuguma, isheen turte.
That rarely happens.	Sun yeroo muraasaaf taʼa.
I needed a lot of help.	Gargaarsa guddaa na barbaachisa ture.
he must ask himself.	jedhee gaafachuu qaba.
He went out there for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf achitti ba'e
I couldn’t go any other way.	Karaa biraa deemuu hin dandeenye.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammadeera.
It should be clear.	Ifa ta'uu qaba.
They are that good.	Isaan akkas gaarii dha.
Maybe she should have.	Tarii qabaachuu qabdi ta'a.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I couldn’t help myself	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye
I wondered where we were	Eessa jirra jedheen yaade
I know you still care about me	Ammallee akka naaf yaaddu nan beeka
Now something was on the way.	Amma waan tokko karaa irra ture.
He was looking for a house	Mana barbaadaa ture
People love you.	Namoonni si jaallatu.
I already know all this	Kana hunda duruu beeka
Not that you like it.	Akka jaallattu miti.
These are good things.	Kun wantoota gaarii dha.
Except that time, I was with you the whole time	Yeroo sana malee, yeroo sana guutuu si waliin ture
It’s my luck.	Carraa kooti.
It’s not what you think.	Waan ati yaaddu miti.
Being.	Ta'uu.
There’s only one thing that doesn’t work.	Wanti hin hojjenne tokko qofa.
Now it’s just a matter of time.	Amma yeroo qofa.
It was really very bad for me.	Dhuguma baay'ee natti hamaa ture.
Maybe no one is there.	Tarii namni tokkollee hin jiru ta'a.
I started doing that, too.	Anis akkas gochuu jalqabe.
But she wasn’t interested.	Garuu fedhii hin qabdu turte.
This was not what he needed.	Kun waan isa barbaachisu hin turre.
Not at all sure.	Tasumaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I didn't think much of it at the time	Yeroo sanatti baay'ee itti hin yaadne
We have hope.	Abdii qabna.
She is not like that	Isheen akkas miti .
We do not even need to talk about it again.	Ammas waaʼee isaa dubbachuu illee nu hin barbaachisu.
Too soon to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf dafee.
I can pretty much see you	Ani baay'ee si arguu danda'a
This is right.	Kun sirrii dha.
This is not the case.	Kun miti.
It was still doing fine.	Ammallee gaarii hojjechaa ture.
I don’t know how she did it, but it doesn’t matter.	Akkamitti akka goote hin beeku, garuu homaa hin qabu.
I still have plenty of time	Ammallee yeroo baay'ee qaba
That is no longer true.	Kana booda sun dhugaa miti.
I mean, we got along with each other	Waliin waliin walii galle jechuu kooti
If so, as .	Yoo akkas ta’e, akkuma .
Not like me.	Akka koo miti.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Garuu waan hamaa miti.
But nobody does that.	Garuu namni akkas godhu hin jiru.
It really wasn’t.	Dhuguma hin turre.
But you have one and you don’t even care.	Garuu tokko qabda dhimma illee hin qabdu.
I want to talk about us	Waa'ee keenya dubbachuu nan barbaada
There isn’t just one right answer.	Deebii sirrii tokko qofa miti.
There is no one else.	Nama biraa hin jiru.
I want to apologize to you both	Lamaan keessan dhiifama gaafachuu barbaada
He came home with me.	Ana waliin mana dhufe.
And I wouldn’t think later,	Anis booda hin yaadu ture,
This is the one.	Kun isa.
Repeat if necessary.	Yoo barbaachisaa ta’e irra deebi’i.
That was something new.	Sun waan haaraa ture.
But this time it was different.	Yeroo kana garuu adda ture.
He was in enough trouble.	Rakkoo gahaa keessa ture.
I didn’t know what to make of it	Maal akkan itti godhu hin beeku ture
Just my thoughts on them.	Yaada koo qofa isaan irratti.
I’m staying with my daughter	Intala koo bira jiraa jira
It wasn’t like that now.	Amma akkas hin turre.
That was very appealing to me	Sun baayʼee natti tola ture
I don’t think that’s true	Sun dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu
He knew where he belonged.	Eessa akka ta'e beeka ture.
I could work with this	Kanaan hojjechuu nan danda'a ture
To join us up here.	Asitti ol nu waliin ta'uuf.
he asked himself.	jedhee of gaafate.
I think he knows that	Kana waan beeku natti fakkaata
I could do something about it	Waan tokko gochuu nan dandaʼa ture
That was when she was little.	Yeroon sun yeroo isheen xiqqoo turte.
Just watch this happening.	Kun ta'aa jiru qofa ilaalaa.
I know it.	Ani beeka.
A few weeks later would have been fine	Torban muraasa booda silaa gaarii ture
I couldn't be with him	Isa waliin ta'uu hin dandeenye
I couldn't help him much	Baay'ee isa gargaaruu hin dandeenye
No one else was around.	Namni biraa naannoo sana hin turre.
I think that would be great	Sun baay'ee gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
We didn’t know what to do with her.	Maal akka ishee goonu hin beekne.
I started walking towards my house	Gara mana kootti deemuu jalqabe
I love you both more than life	Jireenya caalaa lamaan keessan jaalladha
We have that at my house.	Sana mana kootti qabna.
For him.	Isaaf.
It’s not your truth.	Dhugaa kee miti.
I knew it then.	Yeroo sanatti nan beeka ture.
Can't do that this time.	Yeroo kana sana gochuu hin danda'u.
Not without me.	Ana malee miti.
I wonder where he is now	Amma eessa jira jedheen yaada
Everyone would have been looking at me.	Silaa namni hundi na ilaalaa ture.
I just have a few questions	Gaaffii muraasa qofa qaba
But we need your help.	Garuu gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa.
I never would have thought of that	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin yaadu ture
I didn’t know then	Yeroo sana hin beeku ture
I love her, I love her.	Ishee nan jaalladha.
Now I was watching all night	Amma halkan guutuu ilaalaa ture
I thought it didn’t happen.	Anis hin taane jedheen yaade.
You don’t have to.	Dirqama hin qabdu.
I can't do anything about her	Waa'ee ishee homaa gochuu hin danda'u
Now it was just me.	Amma ana qofa ture.
I know this guy.	Gurbaa kana nan beeka.
I want to be a real father	Abbaa dhugaa ta'uu nan barbaada
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
It’s not always like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas miti.
And I said that a long time ago	Anis yeroo dheeraa dura akkas jedheen ture
He was still pleased with himself	Ammas ofitti gammade
Like, you can't even talk about it.	Akka, waa'ee isaa dubbachuu illee hin dandeessu.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I can't believe she's mine	Isheen kan koo ta'uu ishee amanuu hin danda'u
That doesn’t seem right.	Sun sirrii hin fakkaatu.
I can't really say what it is	Dhuguma maal akka ta'e dubbachuu hin danda'u
All in a couple of weeks.	Hundi torban lama lama keessa.
It's going to happen there.	Achitti ta'uuf jira.
He knew he didn't mean for it to be like that.	Akkas akka ta'uuf akka hin yaadne beeka ture.
I can't tell you anything more	Kana caalaa homaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
I was alone with myself	Ofii koo wajjin kophaa koo ture
I wanted to stay with my little dog all day	Guyyaa guutuu saree koo xiqqoo wajjin turuu barbaade
But not for him.	Isaaf garuu miti.
Not when she was watching them from a house.	Yeroo mana tokko keessaa isaan ilaalaa turte miti.
I think you are in a bad mood	Miira hamaa keessa waan jirtu natti fakkaata
But they didn’t have time.	Garuu yeroo hin qaban turan.
Just what they need.	Waan isaan barbaachisu qofa.
I didn’t want to know them.	Isaan beekuu hin barbaanne.
I knew then what was coming.	Yeroo sana waan dhufu nan beeka ture.
Not in my lifetime.	Jireenya koo keessatti miti.
I couldn’t do more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
They just do it better.	Isaan kana caalaa hojjetu qofa.
I should have said she already had one	Silaa duraan tokko qabdi jechuu qaba ture
She shouldn’t have even seen this.	Silaa kana illee arguu hin qabdu turte.
My work is that good.	Hojiin koo akkasitti gaarii dha.
She knows what.	Isheen maal beekta.
Maybe I can do it.	Tarii nan danda'a ta'a.
It needs to be.	Itti barbaachisa.
I haven’t done any for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf tokkollee hin hojjenne
He wouldn’t have done it	Silaa hin godhu ture
We have a lot of shoes.	Kophee baay'ee qabna.
It was better for us.	Nuuf wayya ture.
If this were true.	Osoo kun dhugaa ta'ee.
It’s better this way.	Haala kanaan wayya.
So it will be good.	Kanaaf gaarii ta'a.
This is my house.	Kun mana koo.
I am most certain that they will soon	Yeroo dhiyootti akka isaan qaban hunda caalaa mirkanaa'aa dha
That's not very important.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa miti.
They didn’t want it.	Isaan hin barbaanne.
I think that takes some work.	Sun hojii tokko tokko barbaada jedheen yaada.
Who.	Eenyu.
He has something to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu qaba.
Now I have to say mom and dad	Amma haadha fi abbaa jechuu qaba
I can't live there anymore	Kana booda achi jiraachuu hin danda'u
I didn’t want to see my mom anymore	Haadha koo kana booda arguu hin barbaanne
That shouldn't be the case.	Sun ta'uu hin qabu.
Just how old people are.	Namoonni umuriin isaanii meeqa akka ta'e qofa.
But he didn’t have to do that.	Garuu akkas gochuun isa hin barbaachifne.
This had to be a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta’uu qaba ture.
I want to do this for you	Kana siif gochuu barbaada
It has to be with them	Isaan waliin ta'uu qaba
That didn’t do it.	Sun hin goone.
Except it’s not true.	Dhugaa hin taane malee.
I couldn’t do her	Ishee hojjechuu hin dandeenye
Repeat a couple of times.	Yeroo lama lama irra deebi'i.
I can make money, no problem.	Maallaqa argachuu nan danda'a, rakkoon hin jiru.
I am new to this.	Ani kanaaf haaraa dha.
He must know what he said	Waan inni jedhe beekuu qaba
There was no need for such a thing.	Wanti akkasii hin barbaachisu ture.
I want that too.	Anis sana barbaada.
It may not be the case.	Ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
She was the one.	Isheen turte.
I just need to be with you	Si waliin ta'uu qofa na barbaachisa
But nobody says that.	Garuu namni akkas jedhu hin jiru.
I will go, of course.	Ani nan deema, beekamaadha.
They used to go to school.	Duraan mana barumsaa deemu turan.
I knew better, of course.	Ani kana caalaa beeka ture, beekamaadha.
I was sure she didn't notice	Akka isheen hin hubanne mirkanaa'aa ture
So I didn't want to chance it	Eegaa carraa itti gochuu hin barbaanne
She was no different.	Isheen adda hin turre.
He stared at him for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ija keessa isa ilaale
That’s how the trouble started.	Rakkoon akkasitti jalqabe.
There’s something waiting for me here, something sinister.	Asitti wanti na eegaa jira, waan hamaa.
I wasn't exactly sure	Sirriitti mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I have the time.	Yeroon qaba.
Please try to clarify.	Mee ifa gochuuf yaalaa.
That's probably a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'uu hin oolu.
It’s not great.	Guddaa miti.
It's doing well.	Gaarii hojjechaa jira.
We’re just too different.	Garmalee adda taane qofa.
That’s what we’ve seen.	Kan argine kanuma.
I was a newcomer.	Ani nama haaraa ture.
He should have known she wasn’t	Silaa akka isheen hin taane beekuu qaba ture
It could be a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
It was still early.	Ammas dafee ture.
But it was never going to work in the long run.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa keessatti gonkumaa hojjechuuf hin turre.
Have and haven't.	Qabaa fi hin qabne.
I didn't know about that	Waa'ee sanaa hin beeku ture
How did man become today.	Namni akkamitti har'a ta'e.
I only saw her a few times	Yeroo muraasa qofa ishee arge
Not from my mother.	Haadha koo irraa miti.
We did it.	Hojjenne.
I had no idea she could do this.	Kana gochuu akka dandeessu yaada hin qabu ture.
It could be her.	Ishee ta'uu danda'a.
I know everyone wants to know	Namni hundi beekuu akka barbaadu nan beeka
Which it certainly was.	Kan akka ture beekamaadha.
I would say that is not enough	Ani garuu sun gahaa miti jedha
On his situation with his children.	Haala ijoollee isaa waliin qabu irratti.
I want to know why you did this	Maaliif akka kana goote beekuu barbaada
I want to work.	Hojjechuu barbaada.
It’s not a new problem.	Rakkoo haaraa miti.
I mean, they're more specific	Isaan caalaatti adda ta'uu isaanii jechuu kooti
I don’t know who you are anymore	Kana booda eenyu akka taate hin beeku
I wondered what was wrong	Maaltu dogoggora ta'e jedheen yaade
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.

Good.	Gaarii.
I really need a new one	Haaraa baay'een barbaada
I have nowhere to go but home	Mana malee bakka itti deemu hin qabu
But by then it will be too late.	Garuu yeroo sanatti yeroon booda ta'a.
But there is absolutely no excuse.	Garuu sababni gonkumaa hin jiru.
If not, it should be.	Yoo hin taane ta'uu qaba.
Everything should be simple, easy, simple.	Wanti hundi salphaa, salphaa, salphaa ta’uu qaba.
But it was only a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasa qofa ture.

He thought he was bigger than he was.	Isa caalaa guddaa ta'uu isaa itti fakkaate.
We were no longer alone.	Kana booda kophaa keenya hin turre.
Not much food for this little guy.	Gurbaa xiqqoo kanaaf nyaata baay'ee miti.
You and no one else.	Ati malee nama biraa miti.
I don't want a father for him	Ani abbaa isaaf hin barbaadu
I don't know his name	Maqaa isaa hin beeku
This is going to be bad.	Kun hamaa ta'uuf deema.
Two of your own people were there.	Namoonni ofii keessan lama achi turan.
Not as it is now.	Akka amma jiru miti.
I didn't want to talk about it	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne

It's not like the truth.	Akka dhugaa hin ta'u.
Thus, as.	Kanaan akka.
He told her he didn’t intend to do that	Akkas gochuuf akka hin yaadne itti hime
I don't know if that's the case.	Akkas ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
Maybe too good to be true.	Tarii garmalee gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
That he can do it.	Akka inni gochuu danda'u.
I thought everything would be better	Wanti hundi ni wayya jedheen yaade
But of course she wouldn't have.	Garuu beekamaadha silaa hin qabdu turte.

It was a long way.	Karaa dheeraa ture.
I’m going to do this thing	Ani waan kana hojjechuuf deema
Maybe he wasn't a morning person.	Tarii nama ganama hin turre ta'a.
I really want him to be a good guy	Ani akka inni gurbaa gaarii ta'u baay'een barbaada
It’s okay to be wrong.	Dogoggora jechuun homaa miti.
I couldn’t believe they wanted me	Na barbaadu jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
We should always come back.	Yeroo hundumaa deebi'uu qabna.
She didn't know how he hadn't noticed before.	Akkamitti kanaan dura akka hin hubanne hin beektu turte.
They’re really the only people you can say that about.	Dhuguma namoota akkas jechuu dandeessu isaan qofa.
It doesn’t matter why.	Maaliif jedhu barbaachisaa miti.
I am of all that came before me	Ani waan na dura dhufe hundumaa keessaa dha
It was all real, of course.	Hundi isaa dhugaa akka ture beekamaadha.

So far it is accurate.	Hanga ammaatti sirrii dha.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
I didn’t really know that	Dhuguma sana hin beeku ture
I can't go tomorrow.	Boru deemuu hin danda'u.
I didn't notice anything different about it	Waa'ee kanaa waan adda ta'e hin hubanne
Look at that right up there.	Mee sana sirriitti achi ol ilaalaa.
I don't know of any exceptions.	Kan kanaan ala ta'e tokkollee hin beeku.
He's had enough.	Inni gahaa ta'ee jira.
You are not required to do it.	Ati akka gootu hin barbaachisu.
Anymore, not quite so much.	Kana booda, guutummaatti hangas miti.
She didn't do it very often.	Yeroo baay'ee hin gootu turte.
There is no such obvious possibility here.	Asitti carraan ifa ta’e akkasii hin jiru.
She has no food.	Nyaata hin qabdu.
I am not without a way	Ani karaa malee miti
And I did, he thought.	Anis nan godhe jedhee yaade.
I would love your help	Gargaarsa keessan baay'een jaalladha
I’d rather be doing something else	Waan biraa hojjechuu naaf wayya
We’re just friends.	Nuti hiriyyoota qofa.
He has a house and a car	Manaa fi konkolaataa qaba
It can be just as different.	Akkuma sanaa adda ta’uu danda’a.
I am never alone in anything	Ani gonkumaa waan tokko keessatti kophaa koo hin jiru
And I’m going to stay here	Anis as turuuf deema
It takes a hand.	Harka barbaachisa.
I know a little bit about your problem	Waa'ee rakkoo kee xiqqoo nan beeka
On the on the on.	Irratti irratti.
But sometimes, it doesn't have to be that way.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko, akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
You can see them.	Isaan arguu dandeessu.
He knew that voice well	Sagalee sana sirriitti beeka ture
A case she couldn’t do anything to help.	Dhimma isheen gargaaruuf homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I could have asked him about his parents.	Silaa waaʼee warra isaa isa gaafachuu nan dandaʼa ture.
I had no idea how much	Meeqa akka ta'e yaada hin qabu ture
They were always great.	Yeroo hundumaa guddaa turan.

We were friends, you know.	Hiriyyoota turre, beekta.
I think this is very wrong.	Kun baayyee dogoggora natti fakkaata.
People were too into it.	Namoonni garmalee isa keessa turan.
I know a few people like that.	Namoota akkasii muraasa nan beeka.
She did it.	Ni goote.
It was a feeling of knowing.	Miira beekuu ture.
Some of it is.	Isa keessaa tokko tokko.
But it’s okay, really.	Garuu homaa miti, dhuguma.
Every single thing.	Waan tokko tokko hunda.
I thought you were the only one	Ati qofa natti fakkaate
I didn’t really know what was ahead of me	Waan na dura jiru sirriitti hin beeku ture
I can't believe he did something like that.	Waan akkasii akka godhe amanuu hin danda'u.
Everyone was extremely excited.	Namni hundi garmalee gammade.
Where is he now, he wondered.	Amma eessa jira jedhee yaade.
He is there now.	Inni amma achi jira.
I shouldn’t have been here	Ani as jiraachuu hin qabu ture
It is so long .	Akkas dheeraa dha .

It's not too bad.	Baay'ee hamaa miti.
I know it took a lot of time	Yeroo baayyee akka fudhate nan beeka
I knew this was my chance	Kun carraa koo akka ta'e nan beeka ture
She has no idea.	Yaada hin qabdu.
I couldn't ask any of you for more	Kana caalaa isin keessaa tokkollee gaafachuu hin dandeenye
I can't see the door	Balbala arguu hin danda'u
I think we knew that	Kana waan beekne natti fakkaata
Really this time.	Dhuguma yeroo kana.
I think it's a very valid interview	Gaaffii fi deebii baayyee sirrii ta'e natti fakkaata
He worked with them.	Isaan waliin hojjete.
I didn’t see anyone else around	Nama biraa naannoo sana jiru hin argine
You can't be him.	Ati isa ta'uu hin dandeessu.

I'm sure she wants to meet my father.	Abbaa koo waliin wal arguu akka barbaaddu mirkanaa'adha.
I could never hope to be like that	Ani gonkumaa akkas ta'uuf abdii qabaachuu hin dandeenye
We are here to work.	Hojjechuuf as jirra.

I know everything that is happening is real	Wanti ta'aa jiru hundi dhugaa akka ta'e nan beeka
I can get another job there	Hojii biraa achitti argachuu nan danda'a
She is a good dog.	Isheen saree gaarii dha.
She wasn’t there.	Isheen hin turre.
But it’s better than anything out there.	Garuu waan ala jiru hunda caalaa gaarii dha.
I thought someone was in big trouble	Namni tokko rakkoo guddaa keessa jira jedheen yaade
But that seems to be what happened.	Garuu waan ta'e kanuma fakkaata.
But he said.	Garuu jedhe.
I didn’t want it anymore	Kana booda hin barbaanne
I couldn’t tell him that, of course.	Akkas itti himuu hin dandeenye, beekamaadha.
I didn’t want to know	Ani beekuu hin barbaanne
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I wish you would forgive him	Osoo ati dhiifama isaaf goote natti tola

No one is doing our work for us	Namni hojii keenya nuuf hojjetu hin jiru
I won’t do it anymore	Kana booda hin godhu
Only three days, he thought.	Guyyaa sadii qofa jedhee yaade.
I don't know what happened to her.	Maal akka ishee ta'e hin beeku.
I shouldn’t have gone	Silaa deemuu hin qabu ture
She was teasing him, obviously.	Isheen isa qoosaa turte, ifaadha.
I want no part of this.	Kana keessaa kutaa tokkollee hin barbaadu.
I think not very long ago	Baayyee yeroo dheeraa dura hin turre jedheen yaada
He has no mouth.	Afaan hin qabu.
This is not a new idea.	Kun yaada haaraa miti.
To become a human being.	Nama ta'uuf.
I never would have thought that would have happened	Silaa akkas ta'a jedhee gonkumaa hin yaadu ture
So I knew he was great.	Kanaaf akka inni guddaa ta'e beeka ture.
He needs help	Gargaarsa barbaada
He had nothing.	Homaa hin qabu ture.
I started walking too	Anis deemuu jalqabe
Same work, same food.	Hojiin wal fakkaatu, nyaata wal fakkaatu.
He should have found her earlier	Silaa duraan ishee argachuu qaba ture
I care about you so much	Ani baay'een siif yaada
That couldn't have happened.	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
Not where you want to be.	Bakka ati ta'uu barbaaddu miti.
He was always there	Yeroo hundumaa achi ture
Now you must come with me.	Amma na waliin dhufuu qabda.
I wish it was, but it's not.	Osoo ta'ee natti tola, garuu akkas miti.
I couldn’t leave another one.	Kan biraa dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
It won't be easy.	Salphaa hin ta'u.
I'm so happy for you.	Siif baay'een gammade.
For a moment it looked like there was something she wanted to say.	Yeroo muraasaaf waan isheen jechuu barbaaddu akka jiru fakkaate.
He didn't want to answer.	Deebii kennuu hin barbaanne.
Everything that makes them so special.	Wanti akkas adda isaan godhu hunda.
I'm looking at it	Ani ilaalaa jira
They go great with about everything.	Isaan waa'ee waan hundumaa wajjin guddaa deemu.
I told him all about it	Waa'ee isaa hunda itti hime
No one was happy about it.	Namni tokkollee itti gammade hin jiru.
I didn’t really know him, I knew him	Dhuguma isa hin beeku ture, isa beeka
It wasn’t quite the same.	Guutummaatti wal hin fakkaatu ture.
I wouldn’t call that place home	Bakka sana mana hin jedhu ture
He knows it.	Inni ni beeka.
I think he was great in the situation.	Haala keessa guddaa ture natti fakkaata.
I am as helpless as you are before	Anis kana dura akkuma keessan gargaarsa hin qabu
A little earlier, perhaps	Xiqqoo dura, tarii
I told him, for a while.	Anis itti hime, yeroo muraasaaf.

It still doesn’t work.	Ammallee hin hojjetu.
I don't think it's necessary to do that.	Akkas gochuun barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu.
You may ask why.	Maaliif jettanii gaafachuu dandeessu.
That's pretty obvious.	Sun baayyee ifaadha.

A great man, she had said.	Nama guddaa, jettee turte.
He never did it again.	Amma booda gonkumaa hin goone.
I could be wrong though.	Ani garuu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
I wasn’t interested in doing anything more.	Kana caalaa waan tokko hojjechuuf fedhii hin qabu ture.
I think we have something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qabna jedheen yaada.
Couldn't say whether it was the right one.	Kan sirrii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I know you have it in you	Si keessa akka qabdu nan beeka
That is very dangerous.	Sun baayʼee balaa qaba.
He had to go.	Deemu qaba ture.
Three suggestions this time.	Yaada sadii yeroo kana.
I won't go before tomorrow.	Boru dura hin deemu.
They are everywhere.	Bakka hunda jiru.
No one is an exception.	Namni kanaan ala ta’e hin jiru.
Mine worked well.	Kan koo akka gaariitti hojjete.
He didn’t want a job he loved.	Hojii jaallatu hin barbaadu ture.
It doesn’t mean we’re doing it.	Gochaa jirra jechuu miti.
I just didn’t see his work	Hojii isaa qofa hin argine
They were all very similar but very different.	Hundi isaanii baay’ee wal fakkaatu garuu baay’ee adda turan.
Not even mine, really.	Kan koo illee miti, dhuguma.
He had been right here all along, he thought	Yeroo hundumaa sirriitti as ture jedhee yaade
I have a home, not just a simple home	Mana qaba, mana salphaa qofa miti
We did some good things.	Wantoota gaarii tokko tokko hojjenne.
If not more than that.	Yoo kana caalaa hin taane.
I didn’t want to go without him	Isa malee deemuu hin barbaanne
Nothing happened.	Homaa hin taane.
I'll be alone.	Kophaa koo ta'a.
A little bit for us.	Xiqqoo nuuf.
Like maybe every afternoon.	Akkuma tarii waaree booda hunda.
We have nothing.	Homaa hin qabnu.
He was in this room, he shouldn't have been	Kutaa kana keessa ture, ta'uu hin qabu ture
I know it will happen sometime	Yeroo tokko akka ta'u nan beeka
But she doesn't have it.	Garuu isheen hin qabdu.
I think he wants to see you	Inni si arguu barbaada jedheen yaada
Looks like a big dog.	Saree guddaa fakkaata.
He wasn’t in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa hin turre.
It really wasn't about anything.	Dhuguma waa'ee homaa hin turre.
Then again, maybe not.	Sana booda ammas tarii hin ta'u.
I don’t want them now	Amma isaan hin barbaadu
I don't know why this happens.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u hin beeku.
I can't do it any faster	Kana caalaa dafee hojjechuu hin danda'u
It was in a bar.	Mana dhugaatii tokko keessa ture.
That will never happen to me.	Sun gonkumaa naaf hin ta'u.
I thought that moment needed a little humor	Yeroon sun qoosaa xiqqoo barbaachisa jedheen yaade
So you never have any problems like that.	Kanaaf gonkumaa akkasitti rakkoo tokkollee hin qabdu.
I will never know again.	Amma booda gonkumaa hin beeku.
It’s not like you had it before.	Akka kanaan dura qabdu miti.
There is no such thing.	Waan akkasii hin jiru.
Just when something goes wrong.	Yeroo wanti tokko dogoggora ta'e qofa.
But there is time.	Garuu yeroon jira.
I don’t know why he did that.	Maaliif akkas akka godhe hin beeku.
And yet no one does.	Ammas namni godhu hin jiru.
Something I thought she might have said	Waan tokko isheen jette ta'a jedheen yaade
I know he has a couple	Lama lama akka qabu nan beeka
I still think so.	Ammallee akkas jedheen yaada.
I like that about them	Waa'ee isaanii akkas natti tola
This was obvious.	Kun ifa ture.
Should be a great year.	Bara guddaa ta'uu qaba.
It really could have been one of us	Dhuguma silaa nu keessaa tokko ta'uu danda'a ture
All we can do is respond	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu deebii kennuu qofa
I had no idea he was coming	Akka inni dhufu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It’s too dangerous for us.	Garmalee balaa nuuf qaba.
They had no children together.	Ijoollee waliin hin qaban turan.
I went with him, too	Anis isa waliin deeme
Something completely different.	Waan guutummaatti adda ta'e.
I couldn’t stay here any longer	Kana booda asitti turuu hin dandeenye
I wish they wouldn’t just say that	Osoo akkas qofa hin dubbanne natti tola ture
It’s just the truth.	Dhugaa qofa.
You don’t want to do that.	Ati akkas gochuu hin barbaaddu.
But someone else has to do it.	Garuu namni biraa gochuu qaba.
I don’t want a dog like that.	Ani saree akkasii hin barbaadu.
It might be helpful.	Gargaarsa ta'uu danda'a.
Everything she can’t say.	Waan isheen dubbachuu hin dandeenye hunda.
I didn’t go every day	Guyyaa hunda hin deemu ture
Not too late, not too soon.	Yeroo booda miti, dafee miti.
She has to go.	Isheen deemuu qabdi.
I mean, I have hope.	Abdii qaba jechuu kooti.
This would not work.	Kun hin hojjetu ture.
Thus he was most happy	Akkasitti hunda caalaa gammade
Too long, he thought.	Garmalee dheeraa jedhee yaade.
They can be real.	Isaan dhugaa ta’uu danda’u.
It was everything.	Waan hundumaa ture.
Whether he is there or not.	Achi jira moo hin jiru.
They all knew there could be nothing inside it.	Hundi isaanii wanti keessa isaa jiraachuu akka hin dandeenye beeku turan.
I just need a little help	Gargaarsa xiqqoo qofa na barbaachisa
I mean, it’s more wrong than usual	Yeroo biraa caalaa dogoggora jechuu kooti
I can't help it.	Gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Maybe they are outdated.	Tarii yeroon isaanii darbe ta'a.
I know he wants to come back.	Deebi'uu akka barbaadu nan beeka.
People love it.	Namoonni ni jaallatu.
It has a big problem	Rakkoo guddaa qaba
It worked out well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete.
But it wasn’t hers.	Garuu kan ishee hin turre.
Whoever she is, of course	Eenyu akka taate beekamaadha
But not today.	Garuu har'a miti.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
We didn’t see anyone the whole time we were there.	Yeroo achi turre hunda nama hin argine.
It's working now.	Amma hojjechaa jira.
Something had to happen.	Wanti tokko taʼuu qaba ture.
I know what she wants	Waan isheen barbaaddu nan beeka
I thought you were around tonight	Halkan kana naannoo kee waan jirtu natti fakkaate
But this took time.	Garuu kun yeroo fudhate.
He should never have done that	Silaa gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture
Right with me.	Sirriitti na waliin.
There is nothing here.	Asitti wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
I wonder why he is doing this	Maaliif akkas gochaa jira jedheen yaada
Look at this.	Kana ilaalaa.
The real problem is usually the parents, not the kids.	Rakkoon dhugaa yeroo baayyee warra malee ijoollee miti.
He wanted to know something	Waan beekuu barbaade
I know we have a great one.	Guddaa akka qabnu nan beeka.
When they are good.	Yeroo gaarii ta'u.

Where he belonged	Bakka inni kan isaa ture
Inside of it.	Keessa isaa.
If you are.	Yoo taate.
Ever.	Yoomiyyuu.
I don’t know if that tells us anything	Sun waan tokko nutti himuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku
In this case.	Haala kana keessatti.
I have homework every night	Halkan hunda hojii manaa qaba
I couldn’t see anything anymore	Kana booda homaa arguu hin dandeenye
It was me, it was just me.	Ana ture, ana qofa ture.
They were really good.	Dhuguma gaarii turan.
It had been a week now.	Amma torban tokko ta'ee ture.
I hope you are not in danger	Balaa keessa akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
It’s not a car accident.	Balaa konkolaataa miti.
I know all about that big deal	Waa'ee waan guddaa sanaa hunda nan beeka
I don't want to say	jechuu hin barbaadu
He saw that she was in trouble	Rakkoo keessa akka jirtu arge
But she didn't speak.	Isheen garuu hin dubbanne.
I can't help you with your other needs	Fedhii kee kan biraa si gargaaruu hin danda'u
There is a problem.	Rakkoon jiru jira.
I knew it wasn’t important.	Barbaachisaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
Not exactly though.	Sirriitti garuu miti.
Mostly you have to do well.	Irra caalaa gaarii hojjechuu qabda.
This is nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa miti.
A lot of things.	Waan baay'ee.
It is still working.	Ammas hojjechaa jira.
It wouldn't be money.	Maallaqa hin ta'u ture.
Again, I hoped it wasn't about me	Ammas waa'ee koo akka hin taane abdiin qaba ture
I don't know who asked.	Namni gaafate hin beeku.
I can't do that again	Ammas akkas gochuu hin danda'u
They knew that was coming.	Sun akka dhufu ni beeku turan.
That was a very long time ago.	Sun yeroo baayyee dheeraa dura ture.
I hope someone can help me.	Namni akka na gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I couldn't talk to anyone about my life	Waa'ee jireenya koo namatti dubbachuu hin dandeenye
You didn’t have to go to school.	Mana barumsaa deemuun si hin barbaachifne.
This will be easy for you.	Kun siif salphaa ta'a.
I like doing it though	Ani garuu gochuun natti tola
That was all it was lucky.	Kana qofa ture carraa ture.
He is still my father.	Ammallee abbaa kooti.
That thing really happened at home.	Wanti sun dhuguma mana keessatti ta'e.
But things will happen.	Garuu wanti ni ta'a.
I want to talk about this.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu barbaada.
I can't believe this is happening again	Kun ammas ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
You know.	Ati beekta.
Probably his idea of ​​irony.	Tarii yaada isaa kan qoosaa ta'uu hin oolu.
But you have to get a lot of feedback.	Garuu yaada hedduu argachuu qabda.
He was in it.	Inni keessa ture.
People I didn’t want to know anymore	Namoota kana booda beekuu hin barbaanne
It made it look bad.	Hamaa akka fakkaatu godhe.
I don't mean to yell	Iyyuu jechuu koo miti
They have many places.	Bakka hedduu qabu.
There is just something different about these two.	Isaan lamaan kana keessa wanti adda ta'e tokko qofa jira.
He has everything.	Waan hundumaa qaba.
She will never be here.	Isheen gonkumaa as hin jirtu.
I just don’t have any interest	Fedhii tokkollee hin qabu qofa
I didn’t even know they had one	Tokko akka qaban illee hin beeku ture
So he’s in it.	Kanaaf inni keessa jira.
That one was three years old.	Inni sun waggaa sadii ture.
It must be both of our names.	Maqaa keenya lamaan ta'uu qaba.
That’s not even an issue.	Sun dhimma illee miti.
But anything is possible.	Garuu wanti hundi ni danda'ama.
I mean, that’s obvious	Sun ifaadha jechuu kooti
He looked at everyone.	Nama hunda ilaale.
It was there.	Achi ture.
I just couldn’t get it	Ani qofa argachuu hin dandeenye
He didn't do anything wrong	Waan hamaa hin hojjenne
I love how this turned out	Kun akkamitti akka ba'e baay'een jaalladha
Tell them you think it would be a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ta'a jettee yaaddu itti himi.
I looked into her eyes. 	Anis ija ishee ilaale. 
I didn’t need any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee na hin barbaachifne
So simple things.	Kanaaf wantoota salphaa.
I'm going tomorrow.	Boru deemaa jira.
But even that is not happening.	Garuu sun illee ta'aa hin jiru.
I don’t understand, really.	Naaf hin galle, dhuguma.
Not that there was much time to eat.	Yeroon nyaachuu baay'ee ture jechuu miti.
If not, there is nothing.	Yoo hin taane wanti jiru hin jiru.
You don't understand anymore.	Kana booda siif hin galle.
It's a terrible situation.	Haala hamaa ta'e.
I wish it were true, though.	Osoo dhugaa ta'ee natti tola, garuu.
I haven’t seen you here before	Kanaan dura asitti si hin argine
We shouldn’t get anything at all.	Tasumaa waan tokkollee argachuu hin qabnu.
Just tell them you’re doing it.	Akka gochaa jirtu qofa itti himi.
I don't know what else it could be.	Kan biraa maal ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
People know who you are.	Namoonni eenyu akka taate ni beeku.
We had only done three.	Sadii qofa hojjenne turre.
I totally did that.	Ani guutummaatti akkas godhe.
Now again there is nothing.	Amma ammas homaa hin jiru.
No one has it.	Namni qabu hin jiru.
I've never been lucky	Ani carraa qabu ta'ee hin beeku
I didn't see who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e hin argine
I'm sure he watched it.	Akka ilaale mirkanaa'adha.
I want to make this work	Kana akka hojjetu gochuun barbaada
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
I'm doing pretty good	Ani baayyee gaarii ta'aa jira
That’s just bad.	Sun hamaa qofa.
He didn't want to talk	Dubbachuu hin barbaanne
I went from house to house	Anis manaa gara manaatti nan deeme
He didn’t do the right thing.	Waan sirrii hin hojjenne.
I was just being a little bit	Ani xiqqoo qofa ta'aa ture
This is not an easy matter.	Kun dhimma salphaa miti.
It is still possible.	Ammas ni danda'ama.
I have to do it my way.	Akka kootti gochuun qaba.
It was just a bad time.	Yeroon sun yeroo hamaa qofa ture.
You know, you know.	Ati ni beekta, ni beekta.
He wouldn't have been able to	Silaa hin danda'u ture
I think this is really neat.	Kun dhuguma sirrii natti fakkaata.
You are right there.	Ati sirriitti achi jirta.
She said I should walk down the aisle.	Ani karaa irra deemuu qaba jette.
It’s not the whole picture, though.	Suuraa guutuu miti garuu.
I love these kids.	Ijoollee kana nan jaalladha.
We need and still need so much more.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee nu barbaachisa ammas nu barbaachisa.
With a new wife.	Haadha manaa haaraa waliin.
But, it wasn’t.	Garuu, hin turre.
I want to say it again	Ammas jechuu barbaada
It doesn’t matter right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana dhimma hin qabu.
I think this is a mistake	Kun dogoggora natti fakkaata
Many couldn’t do that.	Baay’een akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I didn't think about it	Ani itti hin yaadne
I can be what you want me to be	Ani waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu nan danda'a
You used to know some of the same people.	Duraan namoota wal fakkaatu keessaa tokko tokko beekta turte.
They know where he’s going.	Eessa akka deemu wal beeku.
One day I had someone tell me this	Guyyaa tokko nama kana natti himu qaba ture
It worked very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjete.
I knew my father.	Abbaa koo nan beeka ture.
Just like a car.	Akkuma konkolaataa.
I was just trying to make it easy	Salphaa gochuuf qofa yaalaa ture
He got us the best of the best.	Inni warra gaarii keessaa isa gaarii nuuf argate.
Most of the time it just seems that way	Yeroo baayyee akkas qofa fakkaata
It will still take time	Ammas yeroo ni barbaachisa
I never wanted to be a father	Abbaa ta'uu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
Sometimes you just can’t make it work.	Yeroo tokko tokko akka hojjetu gochuu qofa hin dandeessu.
But I didn’t need to do anything.	Garuu homaa gochuun na hin barbaachisu ture.
Like a mother.	Akka haadha.
She just doesn’t understand me.	Isheen naaf hin galle qofa.
We’re looking at that.	Sana ilaalaa jirra.
Someone was still there, waiting.	Namni tokko ammallee achi ture, eegaa ture.
I don't understand	Naaf hin galle
There were real people in here.	Namoonni dhugaa as keessa turan.
When that happens, it's two on one.	Yeroo sun ta'u lama tokko irratti ta'a.
But that wasn’t the only reason.	Garuu sababni isaa kana qofa hin turre.
I want a lot more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee barbaada.
I didn't know who he was at the time.	Yeroo sanatti eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
He was looking at him.	Isa ilaalaa ture.
It was still nothing but something, of course.	Ammallee homaa osoo hin taane wanti tokko akka ture beekamaadha.
I love how things are now.	Amma wanti jiru akkamitti akka jiru nan jaalladha.
He always wanted to know	Yeroo hundumaa beekuu barbaada ture
It wasn't a question of whether it was going to happen.	Gaaffii ta'uuf jiraa jedhu hin turre.
I knew she was pretty good	Isheen baay'ee gaarii akka taate nan beeka ture
I just need some time	Yeroo muraasa qofa na barbaachisa
I will never be them	Ani yoomiyyuu isaan hin ta'u
But tonight he had a lot to do	Halkan kana garuu waan baay'ee hojjechuu qaba ture
I love his ways.	Karaa isaa nan jaalladha.
I'm sorry but that's just it.	Dhiifama garuu akkas qofa.
Now a lot of things become clear	Amma wanti baay'een ifa ta'a
Nothing really special.	Dhuguma waan adda ta'e hin jiru.
He wouldn't tell me what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru natti hin himu ture.
So he needs help.	Kanaaf gargaarsa barbaada.
I know something is not going well in your life	Jireenya kee keessatti wanti tokko akka gaariitti akka hin taane nan beeka
If not, that’s fine.	Yoo hin taane gaarii dha.
That has been working for me.	Sun naaf hojjechaa tureera.
You are our light.	Ati ifa keenya.
I knew what he was saying.	Waan jedhu nan beeka ture.
I have school tomorrow	Boru mana barumsaa qaba
I don’t know why not.	Maaliif akka hin taane hin beeku.
There is only one.	Tokko qofa.
Here, with me, that’s how I want you	Asitti, na waliin, akkasitti si barbaada
It has to be complete.	Guutuu qaba.
Maybe you can.	Tarii ni dandeessa ta'a.
The thing is you have to do this.	Wanti kana gochuu qabda.
He said he would do it.	Ni godha jedheera.
We have that one.	Isa sana qabna.
is.	dha.
I really have to go now	Dhuguma amma deemuun qaba
I still doubt she is even my real mother	Ammallee haadha koo isa dhugaa ta'uu ishee illee nan shakka
I can't find her alone	Kophaa ishee argachuu hin danda'u
I want to go with you	Si waliin deemuu barbaada
I think that's what happens.	Akkas ta'a jedheen yaada.
This was a problem.	Kun rakkoo ture.
I never wanted to do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin barbaanne.
That wasn't necessary.	Sun hin barbaachisu ture.
You know where we need to go.	Eessa deemuu akka qabnu ni beektu.
Which I think he was doing.	Kan inni hojjechaa ture natti fakkaata.
Sometimes you can have a snack.	Yeroo tokko tokko nyaata salphaa nyaachuu dandeessu.
I want to know everything that happened that night	Waan halkan sana ta'e hunda beekuu barbaada
I can't say enough good things about it.	Waa'ee isaa gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
So it wasn’t.	Kanaaf hin taane ture.
That was the moment of the night.	Halkan sun yeroo akkasii ture.
Not her parents'.	Kan warra ishee miti.
I just need some time	Yeroo muraasa qofa na barbaachisa
He should have stayed on.	Silaa irra turuu qaba ture.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
He understood their needs.	Fedhii isaanii hubate.
I had my dad and my friends	Abbaa koo fi hiriyyoota koo qaba ture
No one here is willing to help.	Namni as jiru gargaaruuf fedhii hin qabu.
They are still in trouble.	Ammas rakkoo keessa jiru.
So he didn't say anything.	Kanaaf homaa hin dubbanne.
Who wanted to tell everything, absolutely everything.	Kan waan hundumaa himuu barbaade, guutummaatti waan hundumaa.
I think you need some food.	Nyaata tokko tokko si barbaachisa jedheen yaada.
I can see you before that.	Sana dura si arguu danda'a.
It made it look a little different.	Xiqqoo adda akka fakkaatu godhe.
I wasn’t entirely nice	Ani guutummaatti nama gaarii hin turre
All the best.	Gaarii hunda.
I hope we did that.	Akkas akka goone abdiin qaba.
I really like them a lot.	Dhuguma baay'een isaan jaalladha.
I saw you in the street	Karaa keessa si arge
I can't believe what's happening	Waan ta'aa jiru amanuu hin danda'u
On the way home.	Karaa manaa irratti.
Just a lot of it.	Baay'ee isaa qofa.
Not only that.	Qofa miti.
She slept well at night.	Halkan hirriba gaarii qabdi turte.
I wonder what he wants this time.	Yeroo kana maal barbaada jedheen yaada.
It was long before it came to me.	Naaf dhufuu isaa dura yeroo dheeraa ture.
I thought she was right	Isheen sirrii natti fakkaate
They are in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jiru.
I shouldn't have been like that	Ani akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture
I didn't know that was the case	Akkas akka ta'e hin beeku ture
It’s just not true.	Dhugaa miti qofa.
But they needed to eat.	Nyaachuu garuu isaan barbaachisa ture.
Everything that was going to happen would happen.	Wanti ta'uuf deemu hundi ni ta'a ture.
I didn't know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture.
I make it about me.	Waa'ee koo nan godha.
Which, of course, she is not.	Kan, beekamaadha, isheen hin taane.
Then he told me he was leaving.	Sana booda akka deemu natti hime.
It came to me.	Natti dhufe.
You know it, you know.	Ati ni beekta.
He knew that well enough	Sana sirriitti beeka ture
What is not, is not.	Wanti hin taane, miti.
I thought of you often	Yeroo baayyee si yaada ture
I’m in it up to my eyeballs here	Ani asitti hanga ija kootti keessa jira
He wanted to know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaade
I don't know about that.	Waa'ee sanaa hin beeku.
He was not in any danger.	Balaa tokkollee keessa hin turre.
I said you can't.	Hin dandeessu jedheen.
I can't help her.	Ishee gargaaruu hin danda'u.
It was a great thing.	Waan guddaa ture.
It's going to be another situation a little too late.	Haala biraa xiqqoo baayyee booda ta'uuf deema.
It won't be easy, but it's totally possible.	Salphaa hin ta'u, garuu guutummaatti ni danda'ama.
I want him to love me	Akka inni na jaallatu nan barbaada
She was a girl.	Intala turte.
He used to be like them	Duraan akkuma isaanii ture
I thought as much	Anis hamma sana yaade
But none of these things work in the long run.	Garuu wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee yeroo dheeraa keessatti hin hojjetu.
A place where no one knew her anymore	Bakka kana booda namni ishee hin beekne
Just like you did.	Akkuma ati goote.
Most of the time it wasn't enough for me at the time.	Yeroo baay'ee yeroo sanatti naaf gahaa hin turre.
They didn’t need that much time.	Yeroo hamma kanaa isaan hin barbaachifne.
You know you love them.	Isaan akka jaallattu ni beekta.
He thinks she doesn’t want to talk to him.	Isheen isa waliin dubbachuu akka hin barbaanne itti fakkaata.
I still didn't know what would happen after that	Sana booda maaltu akka ta'u ammallee hin beeku ture
I can't even say it's wrong	Dogoggora jechuu illee hin danda'u
I should have helped you sooner	Silaa dafee si gargaaruu qaba ture
I hadn’t seen it like that	Akkasitti hin argine ture
I hadn’t even told him my real name.	Maqaa koo isa dhugaa illee itti hin himne ture.
I thought about her a lot today	Har'a waa'ee ishee baay'een yaade
They love me.	Isaan na jaallatu.
He wouldn’t have done it.	Silaa hin godhu ture.
We can’t know.	Beekuu hin dandeenyu.
Which is very important.	Kan baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e.
I don't want anything else	Ani waan biraa hin barbaadu
Everything is happening.	Wanti hundi ta'aa jira.
But it’s not a book.	Garuu kitaaba miti.
That wasn’t me.	Sun ana hin turre.
I knew how to handle him	Akkamitti akka isa qabdu nan beeka ture
These are not bad kids.	Kun ijoollee hamaa miti.
I can't live without her.	Ishee malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
You will never forgive me.	Yoomiyyuu dhiifama naaf hin gootu.
I still don't understand	Ammallee naaf hin galle
I didn’t want him to go to the wrong room	Kutaa hin taane akka deemu hin barbaanne
But why did this happen.	Garuu maaliif kun ta'e.
That’s not what you were looking for, right?.	Kan ati barbaadaa turte sun miti mitiiree?.
I want to be like that	Ani akkas ta'uu barbaada
I certainly knew him.	Ani akkan isa beeku beekamaadha.
I just need the day.	Guyyaa qofa na barbaachisa.
This is my name on the door.	Kun maqaa koo balbala irra.
More than food.	Nyaata caalaa.
That is a very good idea.	Sun yaada baayyee gaarii dha.
I did as my father did.	Anis akkuma abbaa godhe.
I wondered how he knew her	Akkamitti ishee beeka jedheen yaade
If not, there is a problem.	Yoo hin taane rakkoon jira.
Every single day.	Guyyaa tokko tokko.
It’s a good life.	Jireenya gaarii dha.
That didn’t happen tonight.	Halkan kana akkas hin taane.
I didn’t want you to leave	Akka ati deemtu hin barbaanne
He may be absolutely right.	Inni guutummaatti sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I didn’t realize that I didn’t want to	Akka akkan hin barbaanne hin hubanne
They had it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf qaban turan.
I didn't know anyone	Nama tokkollee hin beekne
It used to be.	Duraan ni ture.
This is not the answer.	Kun deebii miti.
But we wanted it to be simple.	Garuu salphaa akka ta'u barbaanne.
Now I could not be with anyone else	Amma nama biraa wajjin taʼuu hin dandaʼu ture
I thought no one was around	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin jiru jedheen yaade
I wouldn’t have liked it	Silaa hin jaalladhu ture
It still wasn’t enough.	Ammas gahaa hin turre.
We are all willing to help you.	Hundi keenya isin gargaaruuf fedhii qabna.
I'm glad to be you.	Si ta'uu kootti gammadeera.
At the same time, he was no longer there.	Kanuma waliin kana booda hin turre.
But they were lucky.	Garuu carraa qaban turan.
I wanted to tell you	Sitti himuu barbaade
We can only do this if we all speak up.	Kana gochuu kan dandeenyu yoo hundi keenya dubbanne qofa.
I saw her this afternoon	Har'a waaree booda ishee arge
He told her she was 'the one'.	Isheen 'tokko' akka taate itti hime.
But this time he did something different.	Yeroo kana garuu waan adda ta'e hojjete.
It must be a joke.	Qoosaa ta'uu qaba.
I could make this work.	Kana akka hojjetu gochuu nan danda’a ture.
Therefore, we	Kanaaf, nuti .
That’s possible.	Sun ni danda’ama.
I knew it was so much more than that	Kana caalaa baay'ee akka ta'e nan beeka ture
This wasn’t right.	Kun sirrii hin turre.
I couldn’t walk for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf deemuu hin dandeenye
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
She may have had hope a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura abdii qabdi turte ta'a.
I can see all my parents	Warra koo hunda arguu nan danda'a
I wonder what's going on	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen yaada
I haven’t seen her in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ishee hin argine.
He looked at them again.	Ammas isaan ilaale.
In his hands.	Harka isaa keessa.
I wanted to know what he knew.	Waan inni beeku beekuu barbaade.
I love that about him.	Waa'ee isaa sana nan jaalladha.
I can't see enough of her	Ishee gahaa arguu hin danda'u
I just didn't know what that reason was	Sababni sun maal akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
But I need your opinion	Yaada keessan garuu na barbaachisa
I don't know where the week went.	Torban eessa akka deeme hin beeku.
I didn’t know what to make of it	Maal akkan itti godhu hin beeku ture
I don't need it.	Na hin barbaachisu.
Of course, not everyone has the same opinion.	Namni hundi yaada tokko akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
Everything he likes.	Waan inni jaallatu hunda.
In my opinion.	Akka kootti.
It was very early.	Baayyee dafee ture.
Like, we had a lot of friends.	Akka, hiriyyoota hedduu qabna turre.
I didn't know what it meant anymore.	Kana booda maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I knew she was there	Akka isheen achi jirtu nan beeka ture
I didn't know anyone else who could help me	Nama biraa na gargaaruu danda'u hin beeku ture
It could probably go one of three ways.	Karaa sadii keessaa tokko deemuun isaa hin oolu.
He is still here.	Ammallee as jira.
Then you have no chance.	Sana booda carraa hin qabdu.
I couldn’t do anything like that	Waan akkasii hojjechuu hin dandeenye
I know this is a good time.	Yeroon kun gaarii akka ta'e nan beeka.
I think otherwise.	Ani garuu waan biraa natti fakkaata.
I think it's not where it should be though.	Bakka ta'uu qabu garuu hin jiru jedheen yaada.
Look at his eyes.	Ija isaa ilaalaa.
Some of them I can, maybe give some away	Isaan keessaa tokko tokko nan danda'a, tarii tokko tokko kennuu danda'a
Two things are at work there.	Waan lama achitti hojii irra jiru.
Never enough hours in the day.	Guyyaa keessatti gonkumaa sa'aatii gahaa hin taane.
I saw it as clear as day	Akka guyyaa ifa ta'ee arge
No one is going to make you do anything.	Namni homaa akka gootu si godhu hin jiru.
I couldn't have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu hin danda'u ture
I know you know what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru akka beektu nan beeka
I want to be your wife	Haadha manaa kee ta'uu barbaada
He didn't do anything.	Waan tokkollee hin hojjenne.
I didn’t know the answer	Deebii isaa hin beeku ture
It is still ahead of our time.	Ammas yeroo keenya dura jira.
No one knows her name.	Maqaa ishee kan beeku hin jiru.
Maybe she just has to buy time.	Tarii yeroo bitachuu qofa qabdi ta'a.
A lot of them were about me	Baay'een isaanii waa'ee koo turan
But it is not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti.
I was out there, with them	Ani achi ala ture, isaan waliin
Maybe you can get something else out of her.	Tarii waan biraa ishee irraa argachuu dandeessa ta'a.
I still think that’s true.	Ammallee sun dhugaa natti fakkaata.
One of them will be today.	Isaan keessaa tokko har'a ta'a.
We worked well together.	Akka gaariitti waliin hojjenne.
But even that can be dangerous.	Garuu sun illee balaa qabaachuu dandaʼa.
None of them would be.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin ta'u ture.
I really don't know.	Dhuguma hin beeku.
Just met him today	Har'a qofa isa waliin wal arge
Maybe there never will be.	Tarii gonkumaa hin jiru ta'a.
I looked at him well	Anis akka gaariitti isa ilaale
Been working on it for a few weeks now.	Torban muraasaaf amma irratti hojjechaa ture.
It wasn’t big enough.	Guddaa gahaa hin turre.
I love children.	Ijoollee nan jaalladha.
I didn’t really care.	Ani dhuguma dhimma hin qabu ture.
Wait for one.	Tokko eegaa.
This isn’t just me.	Kun ana qofa miti.
One person.	Namni tokko.
I have to go along with this	Kana waliin deemuun qaba
They should know.	Isaan beekuu qabu.
She was very much.	Baayyee turte.
I have to live my life, not her	Jireenya koo jiraachuu qaba malee ishee miti
I need a job.	Hojiin na barbaachisa.
That rarely happens.	Sun yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
There was no one around her.	Namni naannoo ishee hin turre.
Maybe it's good.	Tarii gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
She is my wife.	Isheen haadha manaa kooti.
We need to find her.	Ishee argachuu qabna.
Can you please tell me how to do that.	Mee akkamitti akka sana godhu natti himuu dandeessu.
They didn’t understand.	Isaan hin hubanne.
You can’t really do them.	Dhuguma isaan hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
The two things went to.	Wantoota lamaan gara...
Which could have been true.	Kan silaa dhugaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
Not sure if it's accurate.	Sirrii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
It’s not easy.	Salphaa miti.
They know him well	Akka gaariitti isa beeku
But first you have to do something for me.	Garuu dura waan tokko naaf gochuu qabda.
He knew exactly what was going to happen	Waan ta'uuf jiru sirriitti beeka ture
Exactly what he needs.	Sirriitti waan isa barbaachisu.
You don't know that.	Kana hin beektu.
But he couldn't do that.	Garuu akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I could give you a job	Hojii siif kennuu nan danda'a ture
I said he should help me.	Na gargaaruu qaba jedheen.
Very good question here	Gaaffii baayyee gaarii asitti
You know exactly.	Ati sirriitti beekta.
You have to live with this.	Kana waliin jiraachuu qabda.
It wouldn’t really exist	Silaa dhuguma hin jiru ture
As we should be.	Akkuma ta'uu qabnu.
I hoped he didn’t have it with anyone else	Nama biraa waliin akka hin qabne abdiin qaba ture
Someone with a lot of money	Nama qarshii baay'ee qabu
Day and night.	Guyyaa fi guyyaa.
I mean, it’s completely wrong	Guutummaatti dogoggora jechuu kooti
Living with that.	Sana waliin jiraachuu.
It was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ture.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
Who does that.	Eenyutu akkas godha.
I don't think that's what's happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
You have to tell me what’s coming.	Waan dhufu natti himuu qabda.
I thought you were interested	Fedhii qabda jedheen yaade
I know it wasn’t.	Akka hin turre nan beeka.
I love this place so much.	Bakka kana baay'een jaalladha.
I didn't see my father very often after that	Sana booda abbaa koo yeroo baay'ee hin argine
I know what's going on here.	Asitti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru nan beeka.
You’re with me, so no problem.	Ati na waliin jirta, kanaaf rakkoon hin jiru.
You have to do that to help us.	Nu gargaaruuf akkas gochuu qabda.
I wanted to get an answer today	Har'a deebii argachuu barbaade
I didn't understand anything	Waan tokkollee naaf hin galle
I didn’t know this person.	Nama kana hin beeku ture.
But he didn’t have it.	Garuu hin qabu ture.
I think we have a chance to do some good	Gaarii tokko tokko hojjechuuf carraa qabna jedheen yaada
I really couldn’t stop eating it	Dhuguma nyaachuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
Not enough room for him all over my house.	Mana koo keessatti bakka hunda isaaf gahaa hin taane.
But it was none of these things.	Garuu wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
I know him, I know him.	Ani isa beeka.
It seemed important.	Barbaachisaa fakkaata ture.
I had no idea things were so bad	Wanti akkas hamaa akka taʼe yaada hin qabu ture
They are there.	Isaan achi jiru.
I really didn't want to be alone	Dhuguma kophaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
It was a good time and a bad time.	Yeroon sun yeroo gaarii fi hamaa ture.
But this one could do it.	Inni kun garuu ni danda'a ture.
I really like it here	Dhuguma asitti natti tola
I used to be one of them once	Duraan yeroo tokko isaan keessaa tokko ture
He wants a wife, kids and a home	Haadha manaa, ijoollee fi mana barbaada
They haven’t for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin qaban.
People like me.	Namoonni akka koo.
It was something else in those days.	Bara sanatti waan biraa ture.
I was more of a parent than she was	Ani ishee caalaa warra ture
I need some alone time	Yeroo muraasa kophaa koo na barbaachisa
I might be able to help you with that	Sana irratti si gargaaruu danda'a ta'a
He seems to have understood this.	Kana waan hubate fakkaata.
He didn't have that in him, he thought.	Sana of keessaa hin qabu jedhee yaade.
I really didn’t want to be here anymore	Dhuguma kana booda as jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I don’t understand why you want to do that.	Maaliif akkas gochuu akka barbaaddu naaf hin galle.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
I just didn’t know what to do with it	Maal akkan itti godhu qofa hin beeku ture
He is still here.	Ammallee as jira.
What you have to be.	Waan ta'uu qabdu.
He must be in school	Mana barumsaa keessa jiraachuu qaba
Children really .	Ijoollee dhuguma .
He tried again, and still nothing	Ammas yaale, ammas homaa hin taane
Only for a short time.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
I just didn’t see that	Sana qofa hin argine
But I haven’t seen that from either of these.	Garuu kana lamaan keessaa tokkollee irraa akkas hin argine.
I knew you were in a bad way	Karaa hamaa keessa akka jirtu nan beeka ture
You are a human being like me.	Ati nama akkuma kooti.
I really want that.	Sana baay'een barbaada.
It looked like one.	Tokko fakkaata ture.
It would have been nice.	Silaa gaarii ta'a.
He knew exactly what it was	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti beeka ture
The name you want.	Maqaa ati barbaaddu.
We were in there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi keessa turre.
I can't believe it	Ani amanuu hin danda'u
You're not good enough.	Ati gaarii miti.
I won’t do that to him	Ani akkas isa hin godhu
I have to do this alone	Kana kophaa koo gochuun qaba
Maybe not in our lifetime.	Tarii jireenya keenya keessatti hin ta'u ta'a.
It looked larger than life.	Jireenya caalaa guddaa fakkaata ture.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a.
Nothing too much.	Homaa garmalee hin jiru.
I don’t have a job.	Hojii hin qabu.
I suspect that is obvious	Sun ifaadha jedheen shakka
I love them the most	Ani hunda caalaa isaan jaalladha
We have a couple of suggestions.	Yaada tokko lama qabna.
I don't know if this is the right way.	Kun karaa sirrii ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
That was nothing new.	Sun waan haaraa hin turre.
You could only have one.	Tokko qofa qabaachuu dandeessa turte.
I saw what was happening around me	Waan naannoo kootti ta'aa jiru arge
No mistake, nothing.	Dogoggora hin qabu, homaa hin qabu.
I have no idea how this thing works	Wanti kun akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu
You have to tell me one of yours.	Kan kee tokko natti himuu qabda.
I didn’t have a lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa hin qabu ture.
I mean, nowhere	Bakka hin jirre jechuu kooti
It didn’t, that’s wrong.	Akkas hin taane, sun dogoggora.
I never know his name.	Maqaa isaa gonkumaa hin beeku.
He looks very real.	Inni baay'ee dhugaa fakkaata.
It probably would have worked.	Silaa hojjechuu hin oolu.
Nothing so special there.	Achitti wanti akkas adda ta'e hin jiru.
Something was not right here.	Asitti wanti tokko sirrii hin turre.
He wants to do great things	Waan guddaa hojjechuu barbaada
I shouldn’t have said anything	Ani homaa dubbachuu hin qabu ture
I can't go home without him	Isa malee gara manaatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
It wasn’t for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hin turre.
We’re not the only ones.	Nu qofa miti.
I said I should buy one	Tokko bitachuu qaba jedheen
No night, only day.	Halkan hin qabu, guyyaa qofa.
', and ' are.	', fi ' dha.
He was doing his best.	Inni waan danda'u hunda gochaa ture.
I think we have it.	Qabna jedheen yaada.
So you are very new.	Kanaaf baayyee haaraa taate.
We saw him.	Isa argine.
But people can get it.	Garuu namoonni argachuu danda'u.
I know you’ve been looking for it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf akka barbaadaa turte nan beeka.
Now you can comment.	Amma yaada kennuu dandeessu.
I can do something for you	Waan tokko siif gochuu nan danda'a
I didn’t understand it at the time	Yeroo sanatti naaf hin galle ture
They were children, they were parents.	Ijoollee turan, warra turan.
I want to ask them everything	Waan hundumaa isaan gaafachuu barbaada
This was outdated.	Kun yeroon isaa darbe ture.
I couldn’t leave her	Ishee dhiisuu hin dandeenye
A true, genuine, good man	Nama dhugaa, dhugaa, nama gaarii
It must be unique	Adda ta'uu qaba
Good kids, not bad parents.	Ijoollee gaarii malee warra hamaa miti.
I must be one.	Ani tokko ta'uu qaba.
They are very good friends.	Hiriyyoota baayyee gaarii dha.
I didn't understand what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle
I still wasn't entirely sure.	Ammallee guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I gave a little time there	Yeroo xiqqoo achitti kenne
He was here early.	Inni dafee as ture.
You can make her place.	Bakka ishee gochuu dandeessa.
Nothing is more important than that	Kana caalaa wanti barbaachisaa taʼe hin jiru
I don’t know what I would do in that situation.	Haala sana keessatti maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
He looked at me.	Gara kootti ilaale.
To some extent that doesn’t matter.	Hamma tokko sun homaa hin qabu.
Very good, very good.	Baayyee gaarii, baayyee.
I can tell those things	Wantoota sana himuu nan danda'a
But it wasn’t there anymore.	Garuu kana booda hin turre.
I didn’t go with him.	Ani isa waliin hin deemne.
They have a slightly different way.	Karaa xiqqoo adda ta'e qabu.
I’m still not quite sure how that works.	Sun akkamitti akka hojjetu ammallee sirriitti hin beeku.
Maybe this will work.	Tarii kun ni hojjeta ta'a.
His thinking is probably different.	Yaada isaa adda ta'uu hin oolu.
I mean like, existence and everything.	Akka, jiraachuu fi waan hundumaa jechuu kooti.
It's going to be funny.	Qoosaa ta'a.
It's probably not even true.	Dhugaa illee ta'uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
I hope we both do	Lamaan keenyayyuu akka goonu abdiin qaba
I’m really happy with that.	Dhuguma sanatti gammadeera.
I know this situation	Haala kana nan beeka
I'm not sure of her feelings though	Miira ishee garuu mirkanaa'aa miti
The timing was lucky.	Yeroon isaa akka carraa ture.
Now look at you.	Amma si ilaalaa.
I'm going to go too.	Anis deemaa jira.
I thought it came across well	Akka gaariitti waan dhufe natti fakkaate
But he knew she was right.	Garuu isheen sirrii akka taate beeka ture.
I can't do anything, I have no way.	Homaa gochuu hin danda'u, karaa hin qabu.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Probably not, of course.	Tarii akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He doesn’t do any of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjetu.
They didn’t need it.	Isaan hin barbaachifne.
You know, what we were trying to do.	Beektaa, waan gochuuf yaalaa turre.
We just wanted to leave him there.	Achitti isa dhiisuu qofa barbaanne.
I wonder why something is there	Wanti tokko maaliif jira jedheen yaada
But I can't make it work.	Garuu akka hojjetu gochuu hin danda'u.
He isn’t any worse.	Inni kana caalaa hamaa miti.
He wanted to speak	Dubbachuu barbaade
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I always thought it would	Yeroo hundumaa ni taʼa jedheen yaade
It only took a moment.	Yeroo muraasa qofa fudhate.
It wouldn't have been that easy.	Silaa hangas salphaa hin ta'u ture.
I am trying to do the same thing	Anis kanuma gochuuf yaalaa jira
I didn’t see that coming, either.	Anis sun dhufuu isaa hin argine,
It's not the same as being a mother.	Haadha ta'uu wajjin tokko miti.
But then again maybe not.	Garuu sana booda ammas tarii hin ta'u.
He should have known.	Silaa beekuu qaba ture.
He wanted to stay awhile	Yeroo muraasaaf turuu barbaade
I still couldn’t tell you	Ammallee sitti himuu hin dandeenye
But it's not the same as being alone.	Garuu kophaa ta'uu wajjin tokko miti.
He should have told her	Silaa itti himuu qaba ture
I knew her name, but she didn’t know that	Maqaa ishee nan beeka ture, isheen garuu kana hin beektu turte
I don't know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
You had your chance.	Carraa kee qabda turte.
This seems important.	Kun barbaachisaa fakkaata.
Like a human being.	Akka nama.
They have no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban.
I was almost certain that it was	Akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa ture jechuun ni danda'ama
It's never been right.	Sirrii ta'ee hin beeku.
I had a lot of friends	Hiriyyoota baay'een qaba ture
It looked like a great place.	Bakka guddaa fakkaata ture.
I wasn’t there.	Ani achi hin turre.
Maybe you're right.	Tarii sirrii jette ta'a.
I mean, he didn’t go	Inni hin deemne jechuu kooti
I knew this one.	Isa kana nan beeka ture.
You think you have it.	Akka qabdu sitti fakkaata.
It would have been home.	Silaa mana ta'a ture.
I really don’t think so anymore.	Dhuguma kana booda akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
Often a loner.	Yeroo baayyee nama kophaa ta'e.
He goes to the house.	Gara manaa deema.
Maybe I wasn't even sure.	Tarii mirkanaa'aa illee hin turre ta'a.
He was happening.	Inni ta'aa turee.
But I was sure he was right.	Garuu sirrii akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa ture.
I couldn't help but wonder why	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
He obviously did in this case.	Dhimma kana keessatti akka godhe ifaadha.
There is only one problem.	Rakkoon tokko qofa.
Too good to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii dha.
That was never his job.	Hojiin isaa sun gonkumaa hin turre.
Some people have no problems.	Namoonni tokko tokko rakkoo hin qaban.
But he is very happy about this.	Inni garuu kanaan baayyee gammadeera.
I am always early	Yeroo hundumaa dafee nan ta'a
He was waiting for you	Si eegaa ture
I have a lot of it.	Baay'een qaba.
I can't help but believe them	Isaan amanuu dhiisuu hin danda'u
They were going somewhere.	Bakka tokko deemaa turan.
A very special person	Nama baayyee adda ta'e
I haven’t been here long.	Yeroo dheeraaf as hin turre.
He didn't do this.	Kana hin goone.
Everything was going well for him at the time.	Yeroo sanatti wanti hundi gaarii isaaf deemaa ture.
If it's wrong its wrong.	Yoo dogoggora ta'e dogoggora isaa.
Must be good for you, having that dog around.	Siif gaarii ta'uu qaba, saree sana naannoo kee qabaachuu.
He just loves everything everything.	Inni waan hundumaa waan hundumaa qofa jaallata.
You are the right person.	Ati nama sirrii dha.
It was a lot.	Baay'ee ture.
You’re not that great though.	Ati garuu hangas guddaa miti.
I had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Maybe I should have gone	Tarii deemuun qaba ture
She was obvious.	Isheen ifa taate turte.
I wasn’t doing anything.	Waan tokko hojjechaa hin turre.
We have no such situation in the present case.	Dhimma amma jiru kana keessatti haala akkasii hin qabnu.
You should be the one doing the talking, not him.	Dubbachuu kan gootu si ta'uu qabda malee isa miti.
She wouldn’t do it.	Isheen hin gootu turte.
Maybe I should tell someone.	Tarii namatti himuu qaba.
Maybe he was right.	Tarii sirrii ture ta'a.
No one knows that better than she and her children.	Ishee fi ijoollee ishee caalaa namni kana beeku hin jiru.
I want to do some good	Gaarii tokko tokko hojjechuu nan barbaada
Now it's not right.	Amma sirrii mitii.
That's been a couple of days.	Sun guyyaa lama lama ta'ee jira.
They shouldn’t do that.	Akkas gochuu hin qaban.
He must know what is happening	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba
It's never been an issue.	Dhimma ta'ee hin beeku.
I would have known.	Silaa nan beeka ture.
I know you can do better	Kana caalaa hojjechuu akka dandeessu nan beeka
It’s going well so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii deemaa jira.
An extremely good time.	Yeroo garmalee gaarii ta'e.
This is probably right.	Kun tarii sirrii dha.
I suggest that neither is entirely the case.	Lamaan keessaa guutummaatti akka hin taane yaada kooti.
I have no idea why he is here	Maaliif akka as jiru yaada hin qabu
You just have to have them.	Isaan qabaachuu qofa qabda.
It was probably our mistake.	Dogoggora keenya ta'uu hin oolu.
I enjoyed it, too.	Anis itti gammade.
Tell me what you think about that.	Waa'ee sanaa maal akka yaaddu natti himi.
I love you more than life	Jireenya caalaa si jaalladha
I’m not going to tell you what to do.	Ani maal akka gootu sitti hin himu.
He says to himself.	Jedha ofitti.
It never exists again.	Kana booda gonkumaa hin jiru.
I still couldn’t see a thing	Ammallee waan tokko arguu hin dandeenye
I would have known about it.	Silaa waa'ee isaa beeka ture.
Not like himself.	Akka ofii miti.
Clearly, that is no longer the case.	Kana booda akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
But she said nothing.	Isheen garuu homaa hin dubbanne.
No one wanted it.	Namni barbaade hin jiru.
We need to be doing things right.	Waan sirriitti hojjechaa jiraachuu qabna.
On some of them.	Tokko tokko irratti.
Two weeks later he came again, and again, and again and again.	Torban lama booda ammas dhufe, ammas, ammas ammas dhufe.
It was something everyone could do.	Waan namni hundi gochuu danda'u ture.
Someone who has something to say.	Nama waan jedhu qabu.
That couldn't have happened.	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I want it to be like that	Akkas akka ta'u nan barbaada
It wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa hin turre.
You can do it.	Ni dandeessu.
I didn't like to ask her much at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan baay'ee ishee gaafachuu hin jaalladhu ture.
I know this place	Bakka kana nan beeka
She needs time, maybe a long time.	Yeroo ishee barbaachisa, tarii yeroo dheeraa.
We don’t do that.	Nuti akkas hin goonu.
That’s who he is.	Inni eenyu akka ta’e kanuma.
I didn’t like her work	Hojii ishee hin jaalladhu ture
I know you are not unreasonable	Ati sababa hin qabne akka hin taane nan beeka
It doesn’t work very well.	Baayyee gaarii hin hojjetu.
I wasn’t there for a week	Torban tokko achi hin turre
I didn’t mean that exactly	Sirriitti akkas jechuu koo hin turre
Not yet, man.	Ammas miti nama.
I can’t seem to find it	Ani waanan argachuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
Then what she did was up to her.	Sana booda wanti isheen goote kan ishee ture.
But still not quite.	Garuu ammallee guutummaatti miti.
I know what that thing does	Wanti sun maal akka hojjetu nan beeka
It just has a place	Bakka qofa qaba
He can do that.	Akkas gochuu dandaʼa.
So we had to stay home all day.	Kanaaf guyyaa guutuu mana turuu qabna turre.
Maybe this will go somewhere.	Tarii kun bakka tokko deemuu danda'a.
You know this one.	Isa kana ni beektu.
Friends I didn’t need	Hiriyyoota na hin barbaachifne
I couldn't have gone any further.	Kana caalaa deemuu hin danda'u ture.
Even his daughter.	Intala isaa illee.
I don't have to do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin qabu.
I wondered who did that	Eenyutu akkas godhe jedheen yaade
I could have that with him	Sana isa waliin qabaachuu nan danda'a ture
I mean, of course not	Akka hin taane beekamaadha jechuu kooti
It will be easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa ta'a.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
As husband and wife.	Akka abbaa manaa fi haadha manaa.
Never more than you two.	Isin lamaan caalaa gonkumaa hin jiru.
The worst thing that can happen.	Wanti hamaa ta'uu danda'u.
But two problems.	Garuu rakkoo lama.
House to house.	Manaa manaa.
It can do more than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandaʼa.
I couldn’t believe what he had done	Waan inni godhe amanuu hin dandeenye
It was very large.	Baay'ee guddaa ture.
I'm not there.	Ani hin jiru.
He can go home soon	Dafee gara manaatti deebi'uu danda'a
It can be done.	Hojjechuu danda'a.
Yours needs you though	Keessan si barbaada garuu
They are watching us.	Nu ilaalaa jiru.
I had no idea why this was happening	Kun maaliif akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
Which he was.	Kan inni ture.
I’ve wanted to tell you that for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf akkas sitti himuu barbaade.
It rarely happens like that.	Yeroo muraasaaf akkas ta'a.
Maybe it's true.	Tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
The facts are.	Dhugaa jiru.
Good night now.	Halkan gaarii amma.
I may never have another one, you know	Tarii gonkumaa kan biraa qabaachuu dhiisuu danda'a, beekta
I wasn't really sure.	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But she certainly did.	Garuu akkas akka goote beekamaadha.
I think it exists now	Amma waan jiru natti fakkaata
He knows he’s exaggerating.	Garmalee akka dubbate ni beeka.
Something was going to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf ture.
He had to be.	Inni ta'uu qaba ture.
I knew exactly where I was going	Eessa akkan deemu sirriitti beeka ture
She's probably fine.	Isheen gaarii ta'uu hin oolu.
I want this more than anything	Kana waan hunda caalaa barbaada
I wonder when it might have happened	Silaa yoom ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
I can't stay overnight	Halkan tokko turuu hin danda'u
I just can't be with you again	Ammas si waliin ta'uu qofa hin danda'u
I really did not understand why that was.	Maaliif akkas akka taʼe dhuguma naaf hin galle.
I am completely uninterested anymore	Kana booda guutummaatti fedhii hin qabu
His hands.	Harka isaa.
I don't understand what's going on here	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle
But he didn't say much.	Garuu waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
You didn’t have to go through all this trouble.	Rakkoo kana hunda keessa deemuun si hin barbaachifne.
It has plenty of space.	Bakka baay'ee qaba.
I didn’t know what to tell him	Waan itti himu hin beeku ture
Not necessarily like us.	Dirqama akka keenya miti.
I didn’t know it was there	Achi akka jiru hin beeku ture
I can't do anything for you today	Har'a homaa siif gochuu hin danda'u
I have been doing the same	Anis akkas gochaa tureera
I think it works better now.	Amma caalaatti hojjeta jedheen yaada.
Something very simple.	Waan baayyee salphaa ta'e.
But no one could find them.	Garuu namni isaan argachuu hin dandeenye.
This does not mean that they are not dangerous.	Kana jechuun balaa hin qaban jechuu miti.
We weren’t one for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf tokko hin turre.
But then, maybe you did.	Garuu sana booda, tarii akkas goote taʼa.
That we had no time together.	Yeroon waliin qabnu akka hin turre.
I just didn’t think about it	Ani garuu itti hin yaadne qofa
Someone was watching him.	Namni tokko isa ilaalaa ture.
I couldn’t find a reason not to	Sababa akkan hin goone argachuu hin dandeenye
I loved everyone but myself	Ofii koo malee nama hunda nan jaalladha ture
People, please look at the bigger picture.	Namoonni mee suuraa guddaa ilaalaa.
I really didn’t think so	Dhuguma akkas jedhee hin yaadne
I wasn't there and nobody told me much	Ani achi hin turre namni waan baay'ee natti hime hin jiru
Both of us.	Lamaan keenya.
That was nothing, she said.	Sun homaa hin turre jette.
She didn’t realize she was so alone	Akkas kophaa akka taate hin hubanne
It’s not a complete sound.	Sagalee guutuu miti.
But it’s not enough.	Garuu gahaa miti.
I really thought you were	Dhuguma si natti fakkaate
I don't know if that's a problem.	Sun rakkoo ta'uu hin beeku.
But some things I just couldn’t do.	Garuu wantoota tokko tokko qofa gochuu hin dandeenye.
And yet, that's not what happens at all.	Ammas ta'ee, tasumaa wanti ta'u akkas miti.
He wants to stay with her	Ishee bira turuu barbaada
I love being around them	Naannoo isaanii jiraachuu nan jaalladha
I didn't see him going.	Deemu hin argine.
No one could.	Namni tokkollee hin dandeenye.
But I don't understand why he didn't tell me	Maaliif akka natti hin himne garuu naaf hin galle
But he was going.	Garuu deemaa ture.
No one should have said it.	Namni tokkollee jechuu hin qabu ture.
I know.	Beeka.
I know all about this stuff	Waa'ee waan kanaa hunda nan beeka
He had no children of his own.	Ijoollee ofii hin qabu ture.
Maybe that would have been enough.	Tarii silaa sun gahaa ta'a ture.
He just, like.	Inni qofa, akka.
I couldn’t believe this	Kana amanuu hin dandeenye
He was again.	Inni ammas ture.
Who else could it be.	Kan biraa eenyu ta'uu danda'a.
I need a daily routine	Hojii guyyaa guyyaa na barbaachisa
I want him to like my work	Hojii koo akka jaallatu nan barbaada
I don't want that to happen.	Akkas akka ta'u hin barbaadu.
We didn't meet.	Wal hin argine.
I had no idea where I was going.	Eessa akkan deemu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Maybe it will be different this time.	Tarii yeroo kana adda ta'a.
Very long, indeed	Baayyee dheeraa, dhuguma
Like everyone else does.	Akkuma namni hundi godhu.
They forgive his hand.	Harka isaa dhiifama godhu.
They do what he does.	Waan inni hojjetu ni hojjetu.
There is good reason for this	Kanaaf sababa gaarii qaba
Today this could not be more true.	Har’a kun kana caalaa dhugaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
I know now what it was	Maal akka ture amma beeka
I don’t think he likes it.	Inni waan jaallatu natti hin fakkaatu.
That was a month ago.	Sun ji'a tokko dura ture.
Sometimes I need it but not always	Yeroo tokko tokko na barbaachisa garuu yeroo hunda miti
You really didn’t have to do that	Dhuguma akkas gochuun si hin barbaachifne
But that wasn’t enough.	Sun garuu gahaa hin turre.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
I thought about it even more	Anis kana caalaa itti yaade
I know a lot of your work	Hojii keessan baay'een beeka
Look at that now.	Mee amma sana ilaalaa.
It was so very good.	Akkas baayyee gaarii ture.
I don't know why, but it was.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu akkas ture.
I was pretty sure tonight was going to be the night.	Halkan kana halkan akka ta'u baay'ee mirkanaa'aa ture.
You can ask.	Gaafachuu dandeessa.
I want everything now	Waan hundumaa amma barbaada
What you want your work to look like.	Hojiin kee maal akka fakkaatu barbaaddu.
I really, really did	Dhuguma, dhuguma nan godhe
It was very new.	Baayyee haaraa ture.
Man is not evil in that he has evil desires	Namni fedhii hamaa qabaachuu isaatiin hamaa miti
They have a lot of answers.	Deebii baay'ee qabu.
I want to apologize for that	Kanaaf dhiifama gaafachuu barbaada
He still didn’t say anything	Ammallee homaa hin dubbanne
Nothing is going on.	Wanti deemaa jiru hin jiru.
You can't make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuu hin dandeessu.
But this is more important.	Garuu kun caalaatti barbaachisaa dha.
I can't have them.	Isaan qabaachuu hin danda'u.
No one spoke to him.	Namni itti dubbate hin jiru.
This was my reality.	Kun dhugaa koo ture.
I thought about her all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa waaʼee ishee nan yaada ture.
I wanted to make mine.	Kan koo gochuu barbaade.
He knew he had no chance.	Carraa akka hin qabne ni beeka ture.
He wasn't with anyone	Nama waliin hin turre
We’re all trying to help	Hundi keenya gargaaruuf yaalaa jirra
I think it used to be	Duraan kan ture natti fakkaata
I know you know this.	Kana akka beektu nan beeka.
He did all this for you	Kana hunda siif godhe
Then he looked at his watch.	Sana booda sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
But you know what, it worked.	Garuu maal beekta, hojjete.
That's why, of course.	Kanaaf akka ta'e beekamaadha.
They don't have time for this.	Kanaaf yeroo hin qaban.
But there were many of them.	Garuu baay'een isaanii turan.
Just like them.	Akkuma isaanii.
I wanted to be like her	Anis akka ishee ta'uu barbaade
I wonder who that might be	Sun eenyu ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
I didn’t want to say anything	Ani homaa jechuu hin barbaanne
Maybe she's not sure.	Tarii isheen mirkanaa'aa miti.
I didn’t want to go any further with him, yet	Isa waliin kana caalaa deemuu hin barbaanne, ammallee
I don't understand that	Sana naaf hin galle
It used to happen.	Duraan ta'aa ture.
I knew there was so much more to it	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee akka jiru nan beeka ture
I looked up at the moon	Ol jedheen ji'a ilaale
In my hands.	Harka koo keessa.
I told him the truth	Dhugaa jiru itti hime
Not often, but there are opportunities.	Yeroo baayyee miti, garuu carraan jira.
Maybe he has before	Tarii kanaan dura qabaachuu danda'a
One thing one day, another another.	Waan tokko guyyaa tokko, waan biraa kan biraa.
I don't mean anything like that.	Waan akkasii jechuu koo miti.
But we won’t do it now.	Garuu amma hin goonu.
You can see the place in the picture.	Bakka sana suuraa irratti arguu dandeessu.
I don't think so.	Akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
Things that matter.	Wantoota dhimma qaban.
She had none of it.	Isheen tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
That sounds pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
I thought that was outstanding	Sun waan adda ta'e natti fakkaate
Many think so.	Baay'een akkas yaadu.
Something about that.	Waa'ee sanaa waan tokko.
I know it, too.	Anis ni beeka.
Well done !.	Gaarii goote !.
I didn't know what time it was.	Sa'aatii meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I don't understand why	Maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle
I have little issues now.	Amma dhimma xiqqoo qaba.
We need to ask ourselves.	Of gaafachuu qabna.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
It'll be good.	Gaarii ta'a.
Which they didn’t.	Kan isaan hin goone.
So even we.	Kanaaf nuti illee.
That's what I mean.	Kana jechuu kooti.
I know that he knows	Inni akka beeku nan beeka
I think they were expecting it	Waan isaan eegaa turan natti fakkaata
I certainly do.	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha.
They should have done something.	Silaa waan tokko gochuu qabu turan.
It was a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Maybe he still lives with the parents.	Tarii ammallee warra waliin jiraata.
That's never been much.	Sun baay'ee ta'ee hin beeku.
It wasn’t on the old days	Bara durii irratti hin turre
I thought I had another year	Waggaa biraa qaba jedheen yaade
I think everyone just loves her	Namni hundi ishee qofa jaallata jedheen yaada
I didn't realize how much	Meeqa akka ta'e hin hubanne
Maybe you should have stayed home.	Tarii silaa mana turuu qabdu ta'a.
But nothing much.	Garuu homaa baay'ee miti.
He must know something	Waan tokko beekuu qaba
That's it.	Kanuma.
There was still hope.	Ammas abdiin ture.
They have a matter.	Dhimma qabu.
But I can tell you this	Kana garuu sitti himuu nan danda'a
They shouldn’t have done it, of course.	Silaa gochuu hin qaban turan, beekamaadha.
This was good for us.	Kun nuuf gaarii ture.
That wouldn't be right.	Wanti akkasii sirrii hin ta'u ture.
Only Mom can’t really know.	Dhuguma beekuu kan hin dandeenye Haadha qofa.
No one else does.	Namni biraa hin godhu.
But there was none of that.	Garuu sana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
I think three isn't too bad	Sadii baayyee hamaa miti jedheen yaada
We should have done that, but no one really did.	Nuti akkas gochuu qabna turre, garuu dhuguma namni akkas godhe hin jiru.
There wasn't much you could do.	Waan baay'ee gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
I hope this helps!.	Kun akka gargaaru abdiin qaba!.
This has been going on for a long time.	Kun yeroo dheeraaf deemaa ture.
Oh.	Maaloo.
I wonder what's going on	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen yaada
I didn’t realize how long it had been	Yeroo dheeraa akka ture hin hubanne
But that was no longer true.	Garuu sun kana booda dhugaa hin turre.
It came to me.	Natti dhufe.
I'm going to go right.	Ani sirriitti nan deema.
I had no idea about it, really	Waa'ee isaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture, dhuguma
I wish things were different for him	Osoo wanti adda ta'ee isaaf ta'ee natti tola
It couldn't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I wasn't sure how much	Meeqa akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre
There was a time.	Yeroon ture.
I know what it is	Maal akka taʼe nan beeka
This is clearly not the case.	Kun akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
Not so much a question.	Gaaffii hangas miti.
He still wouldn’t do it.	Ammallee hin godhu ture.
He had done nothing.	Inni homaa hin hojjenne ture.
She needed to be home with the kids.	Ijoollee wajjin mana taʼuu qabdi turte.
He knew exactly who he was	Eenyu akka ta'e sirriitti beeka ture
One two three.	Tokko lama sadii.
It worked fine for me though.	Naaf garuu gaarii ta'ee hojjete.
It came from nothing.	Homaa irraa dhufe hin jiru.
I can't work out why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hojjechuu hin danda'u.
You don't know anything.	Ati homaa hin beektu.
I really can't believe she's mine	Dhuguma isheen kan koo ta'uu ishee amanuu hin danda'u
It wasn’t completely insensitive	Guutummaatti miira hin qabne hin turre
Three bad moments.	Yeroo hamaa sadii.
I really like them a lot	Dhuguma baay'een isaan jaalladha
I knew she wanted me	Isheen akka na barbaaddu nan beeka ture
At the same time.	Kanuma waliin.
That totally happens.	Sun guutummaatti ni ta'a.
Can you please help me with this?.	Mee kana irratti na gargaaruu dandeessu?.
Not much later.	Baay'ee booda miti.
I like the sound of your voice	Sagalee sagalee kee natti tola
No one can help who it is.	Namni eenyu akka ta'e gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I don't know him	Ani isa hin beeku
I didn’t want to stay long	Yeroo dheeraa turuu hin barbaanne
You were here.	Ati as turte.
I can't help giving up	Harka kennuu dhiisuu hin danda'u
All was going well.	Hundi akka gaariitti deemaa ture.
I don’t know any of these people involved.	Namoota kana keessaa harka qabu tokkollee hin beeku.
Sometimes there's not much you can do.	Yeroo tokko tokko wanti ati gochuu dandeessu baay'ee hin jiru.
You have one month.	Ji'a tokko qabda.
I think she wants it	Isheen waan barbaaddu natti fakkaata
He was walking down the street at night	Halkan karaa irra deemaa ture
I wasn’t looking at anything.	Homaa ilaalaa hin turre.
I always wanted to have him	Yeroo hundumaa isa qabaachuu nan barbaada ture
Not much of anything.	Waan baay'ee miti.
They work together.	Waliin hojjetu.
You have to say it.	Jechuu qabda.
I can't leave him.	Ani isa dhiisuu hin danda'u.
I went with him that day.	Guyyaa sana isa waliin deeme.
It could be a week, it could be two.	Torban tokko ta'uu danda'a, lama ta'uu danda'a.
I love her, but that’s not her	Ani ishee nan jaalladha, garuu sun ishee miti
No one else was there.	Namni biraa achi hin turre.
I was alone in there.	Ani kophaa koo achi keessa ture.
It's mine.	Kan kooti.
I love cars, and good work	Konkolaataa, fi hojii gaarii nan jaalladha
But you can see him.	Garuu isa arguu dandeessa.
You can do this.	Kana gochuu dandeessa.
I knew you cared about me	Akka naaf yaaddu nan beeka ture
Both ways.	Karaa lamaan.
I'm not sure she can	Isheen akka dandeessu mirkanaa'aa miti
I hope this helps you.	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
Everyday clothes.	Uffata guyyaa guyyaa.
This one did it.	Inni kun ni godhe.
In this he knew he was an exception.	Kana keessatti inni ala ta’uu isaa beeka ture.
I knew it would be something great	Waan guddaa akka ta'u nan beeka ture
But that has to come later.	Garuu sun booda dhufuu qaba.
She was very young, therefore.	Isheen baay'ee xiqqoo turte, kanaaf.
Maybe a dress.	Tarii uffata tokko.
You are not enough.	Ati gahaa miti.
You know what he wanted.	Waan inni barbaade ni beekta.
Not just what to do but how to do it.	Maal gochuu qofa osoo hin taane akkamitti akka goonu.
He had no chance.	Carraa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It's not good.	Gaarii miti.
Something very different	Wanti baayyee adda ta'e
As much as we wanted.	Hamma barbaanne.
I have nothing to say about any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee waanan jedhu hin qabu
Really, really, pretty good at that.	Dhugaa, dhugaa, kanuma irratti baay'ee gaarii dha.
I didn’t really know what he was talking about	Waan inni jedhu dhuguma hin beeku ture
I really didn't know what was going on	Dhuguma maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
This didn’t happen	Kun hin taane
Not one of us, but both of us.	Nu keessaa tokko miti, lamaan keenya.
They are often wrong.	Yeroo baayyee dogoggora ta'u.
Then something hit me.	Sana booda wanti tokko natti dhufe.
This was no such thing.	Kun waan akkasii hin turre.
I know what was happening	Waan ta'aa ture nan beeka
I wanted to go with them.	Isaan waliin deemuu barbaade.
He was truly a great man.	Dhuguma nama guddaa ture.
It wasn’t the right place	Bakka sirrii hin turre
I wasn't sure where it was	Eessa akka jiru mirkanaa'aa hin turre
We were children.	Ijoollee turre.
It was a joke on the spot	Bakka sanatti qoosaa ture
This may not always be the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
But he couldn't go back.	Garuu duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
Please, this time.	Maaloo, yeroo kana.
Only for a short time.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
He knew it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane beeka ture.
Someone was nice to me.	Namni tokko natti gammade gaarii ture.
I need an answer.	Deebii na barbaachisa.
I just wanted to see her.	Ishee arguu qofa barbaade.
I ignored it, too.	Anis bira darbe.
I didn't know her	Ani ishee hin beekne
Just saw it last week.	Torban darbe qofa arge.
A new opportunity, and a great one	Carraa haaraa, fi guddaa
That was dangerous, too much.	Sun balaa qaba ture, garmalee.
He was such a nice guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii akkasii ture.
I didn’t want that, but it was.	Ani akkas hin barbaanne, garuu akkas ture.
Please, no more.	Maaloo, kana booda hin ta'u.
I would have been completely alone	Silaa guutummaatti kophaa koo ta'a ture
He stared at her for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ija keessa ishee ilaale.
Today was the worst.	Har'a isa hamaa ture.
That may be what’s going on here.	Asitti kan deemaa jiru kanuma ta’uu danda’a.
Sometimes I think about her	Yeroo tokko tokko waa'ee ishee nan yaada
Nothing like that ever happened.	Wanti akkasii tasumaa hin taane.
He is still there.	Ammas achi jira.
Then how does one know it is perfect.	Sana booda akkamitti namni tokko guutuu ta'uu isaa beeka.
I thought he would say something	Waan tokko ni jedha jedheen yaade
Everything is fine.	Hundi gaarii dha.
I wasn't sure what happened	Waan ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre
One could do worse.	Namni tokko kana caalaa hamaa hojjechuu dandaʼa.
I hold you in my arms	Si harka kootti qaba
He had this morning.	Ganama kana qaba ture.
But none of them did.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee hin goone.
But I don’t think that’s it.	Garuu sun natti hin fakkaatu.
It doesn’t come.	Hin dhufu.
But I wanted to apologize	Ani garuu dhiifama gaafachuu barbaade
I would see her again.	Silaa ammas ishee arguu ture.
I wasn't great about it	Ani waa'ee isaa guddaa hin turre
That's exactly what happens.	Kan ta'u sirriitti kanuma.
He should have known that wasn’t the case	Silaa akkas akka hin taane beekuu qaba ture
She had to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabdi turte.
I don't want to believe this	Kana amanuu hin barbaadu
I wasn’t here that way	Ani akkasitti as hin turre
I didn't want to be that girl anymore	Kana booda intala sana ta'uu hin barbaanne
There is no such thing now.	Amma wanti akkasii hin jiru.
But his eyes.	Garuu ija isaa.
But it can't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin danda'u.
He quickly walked into the bar	Dafee mana dhugaatii sana keessa deeme
I had no idea it would go this far.	Hanga kana akka deemu yaada hin qabu ture.
He gave it to you.	Inni siif kenne.
I think it was the biggest one around	Kan naannoo sana jiru keessaa isa guddaa ture jedheen yaada
I will never tell.	Yoomiyyuu hin himu.
She didn't speak.	Isheen hin dubbanne.
Now it was his time.	Amma yeroo isaa ture.
That would have been nice.	Silaa sun gaarii ture.
I am not one of them.	Ani isaan keessaa tokko miti.
That is very important.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
Now tell me what it is.	Amma maal akka ta'e natti himi.
He took the book as his own.	Kitaaba sana akka kan isaatti fudhate.
I did not understand what that was	Sun maal akka taʼe naaf hin galle
You know that we have.	Akka qabnu ni beektu.
I want your children	Ijoollee keessan nan barbaada
Sometimes it looks like a disaster.	Yeroo tokko tokko balaa fakkaata.
But it will exist.	Garuu ni jiraata.
Someone else made it happen	Namni biraa akkas akka ta'u godhe
Not that he understood.	Inni hubate jechuu miti.
i'm just playing.	ani taphachuu qofa.
Maybe in the morning.	Tarii ganama ta'uu danda'a.
Return with error.	Dogoggora waliin deebi'i.
There was none that night.	Halkan sana tokkollee hin turre.
I shouldn’t have eaten so much	Silaa hamma kana nyaachuu hin qabu ture
It was his duty.	Dirqama isaa ture.
I have no idea what she was doing there	Achitti maal hojjechaa akka turte yaada hin qabu
But it’s not quite there.	Garuu guutummaatti hin jiru.
It would just be ridiculous.	Qoosaa qofa ta'a.
I walked down the street	Anis karaa irra deeme
That's very unlikely though.	Sun garuu baayyee hin oolu.
He must know the truth	Dhugaa jiru beekuu qaba
Walk in crowds.	Namoota hedduu keessa deemaa.
We already have an idea of ​​what to do.	Waan goonu irratti yaada duruu qabna.
I wasn’t on here in a while.	Yeroo muraasa booda as irra hin turre.
I want to know the answer	Deebii isaa beekuu barbaada
It was a simple accident	Balaa salphaa ture
We just did the work.	Hojii qofa hojjenne.
There is always a reason.	Yeroo hunda sababni jira.
We need help.	Gargaarsa nu barbaachisa.
They have that picture.	Suuraa sana qabu.
Just stuff and nonsense	Waan fi waan hin taane qofa
A simple question.	Gaaffii salphaa.
That may no longer be true.	Sun kana booda dhugaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
He wants it to be him more than anything else	Waan hundumaa caalaa akka isa ta'u barbaada
It must be one of us.	Nu keessaa tokko ta'uu qaba.
It must happen sometime.	Yeroo tokko ta'uu qaba.
He gave me a lot of space at that time	Yeroo sanatti bakka guddaa naaf kenne
I think it is possible	Ni danda'ama jedheen yaada
He realized he was human.	Nama ta'uu isaa hubate.
But she is not unique.	Garuu isheen adda miti.
We are in a good time now.	Amma yeroo gaarii keessa jirra.
I want it just like you do	Anis akkuma keessan barbaada
I think we've all had enough	Hundi keenya waan gahaa ta'e natti fakkaata
He knew all the time she was there, of course.	Yeroo isheen achi turte hunda beeka ture, beekamaadha.
I saw it in their eyes	Ija isaanii keessatti arge
Not bad wait times during the day.	Guyyaa yeroon yeroon eegaa hamaa miti.
Of course, he could not do that.	Kana inni gochuu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
I never know how to say this	Kana akkamitti akkan jedhu gonkumaa hin beeku
I cannot be either	Anis taʼuu hin dandaʼu
You couldn’t have done it.	Silaa gochuu hin dandeessu turte.
You’re better off without me, I told myself	Ana malee si wayya jedheen ofitti hime
I mean, you know exactly who and what you are	Eenyu fi maal akka taate sirriitti beekta jechuu kooti
Things would have been very different now.	Silaa amma wanti jiru baayʼee adda taʼa ture.
I wasn’t alone in this	Kana keessatti kophaa koo hin turre
I have.	Ani qaba.
Nothing about herself.	Waa'ee ofii ishee homaa hin qabu.
He was helpless against her.	Ishee irratti gargaarsa hin qabu ture.
I love him very, very much	Baay'ee baay'een isa jaalladha
She needs her space.	Bakka ishee ishee barbaachisa.
Tell me how you did it.	Akkamitti akka goote natti himi.
I am with them in that work	Ani hojii sana keessatti isaan waliin jira
He had no time for nonsense	Waan hin taane isaaf yeroo hin qabu ture
I think that's pretty good	Sun baayyee gaarii natti fakkaata
They are there now.	Amma achi jiru.
I could not have done it without your work.	Silaa hojii kee malee gochuu hin danda'u ture.
It gave way a bit.	Xiqqoo karaa kenne.
I think it always does	Yeroo hundumaa ni ta'a jedheen yaada
That should help him in the long run.	Sun yeroo dheeraa keessatti isa gargaaruu qaba.
I'm glad it was a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu isaatti gammadeera.
She may have parents.	Warra qabdi taʼuu dandaʼa.
He wasn’t there to help	Gargaaruuf achi hin turre
He should have done that right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sana gochuu qaba ture.
I shouldn’t have said that.	Silaa akkas jechuu hin qabu ture.
I can't say that about most people	Waa'ee namoota baay'ee akkas jechuu hin danda'u
I know it couldn't have been you	Silaa si ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
That’s if he starts.	Sun yoo inni jalqabe.
You knew it.	Ati beekta turte.
You can't go back again.	Ammas duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
I don't understand that	Sana naaf hin galle
I can't have too many	Baay'ee qabaachuu hin danda'u
It would have never happened.	Silaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
It was out of place to say that.	Akkas jechuun bakka isaa hin turre.
You don't have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin qabdu.
I can't do anything about that	Sana irratti homaa gochuu hin danda'u
But none of those things are true.	Garuu wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa miti.
I think they have that feeling	Miira sana qaban natti fakkaata
A week later it was ours	Torban tokko booda kan keenya ture
He was the one who asked this question.	Gaaffii kana kan gaafate isa ture.
He had a bad feeling about them	Waa'ee isaanii miira hamaa qaba ture
It can only be one way.	Karaa tokko qofa ta’uu danda’a.
I’ve never said that to her in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti akkas jedhee isheen hin beeku.
I wouldn’t want to do that	Ani akkas gochuu hin barbaadu ture
I couldn’t see his name	Maqaa isaa arguu hin dandeenye
It's a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii dha.
I wanted to do some work.	Hojii tokko tokko hojjechuu barbaade.
Now she wanted none in her thoughts.	Amma yaada ishee keessatti tokkollee hin barbaanne.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
Not much around here.	Naannoo asitti baay'ee miti.
You just sit there.	Ati qofa taa'a.
I was, again, going to another school	Ani, ammas, mana barumsaa biraa deemaa ture
I didn’t mean that.	Ani akkas jechuu hin barbaanne.
He just loves to play.	Inni taphachuu qofa jaallata.
I am very, very happy.	Baayyee baayyee gammadeera.
He had something to say on the subject.	Dhimma kana irratti waan jedhu qabaa ture.
I can't speak.	Dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Now he's on his way back	Amma karaa deebi'uu irra jira
I can't believe any of this is happening	Kana keessaa tokkollee ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
He had a feeling something was going to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf akka jiru miira qaba ture.
They were waiting.	Isaan eegaa turan.
Everything is different now.	Amma wanti hundi adda.
But in a more unconscious way	Garuu karaa of hin beekne caalaa
It's a possibility, not a promise.	Ta'uu danda'a malee waadaa miti.
There was nothing anyone could do.	Wanti namni tokkollee gochuu danda'u hin turre.
I really don't know anything about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku.
Where are you?.	Eessa jirtu?.
That sounds pretty bad.	Sun baayyee hamaa fakkaata.
A dog man came out	Namni saree tokko ba'e
There were a lot of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee turan.
We both wanted it.	Lamaan keenyayyuu barbaanne.
I was really looking for something similar.	Dhuguma waan wal fakkaatu barbaadaa ture.
Today I have only been here three weeks.	Har'a torban sadii qofa as ture.
But he didn't understand.	Garuu hin hubanne.
I want you to forgive me	Akka ati dhiifama naaf gootu nan barbaada
I couldn’t even get that right	Sana sirriitti illee argachuu hin dandeenye
I searched in my mouth	Afaan koo keessa barbaade
But no one cared.	Garuu namni dhimma godhe hin jiru.
I will be everything you need	Ani waan isin barbaachisu hunda nan ta'a
There was none of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
I am perfectly happy with my life	Jireenya kootti guutummaatti gammadeera
People came home sometimes.	Namoonni yeroo tokko tokko gara manaatti dhufu turan.
All he found was the truth.	Wanti inni argate dhugaa qofa ture.
I didn’t know how to tell	Akkamitti akkan himu hin beeku ture
I was doing the same thing	Anis kanuma hojjechaa ture
I cannot apologize to you enough	Dhiifama kee gahaa gaafachuu hin danda'u
They know where you are.	Bakka jirtu ni beeku.
This is the only possibility.	Kun qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I love my life.	Jireenya koo nan jaalladha.
I just couldn’t leave them	Isaan dhiisuu qofa hin dandeenye
I think a long time ago	Yeroo dheeraa dura natti fakkaata
He’s not coming.	Inni hin dhufu.
There was no time for work.	Yeroon hojii hin turre.
This is where things become very clear to me.	Bakka wanti baay’ee naaf ifa ta’e kana.
Maybe it's a good thing.	Tarii waan gaarii ta'a.
That would have been too easy.	Silaa sun garmalee salphaa ture.
But that’s almost obvious.	Garuu sun ifaadha jechuun ni danda’ama.
I want him inside me	Keessa kootti isa barbaada
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Tarii xiqqoo, tarii baay'ee ta'a.
I have them.	Isaan qaba.
I was in time for this issue	Dhimma kana yeroon ture
I have no real problem with this.	Kana irratti rakkoo dhugaa hin qabu.
I think you should stay here	As turuu qabdu jedheen yaada
Love that girl.	Intala sana jaalladhu.
He was that good	Inni akkas gaarii ture
That would have been better.	Sun wayya ture.
It doesn’t have a date.	Guyyaa hin qabu.
We have to live.	Jiraachuu qabna.
It didn’t seem to exist.	Kan jiru hin fakkaatu ture.
We did our job.	Hojii keenya hojjenne.
He said it wasn't.	Akka hin taane jedhe.
Someone you need to know.	Nama beekuu qabdu.
I told him the truth.	Dhugaa jiru itti hime.
I would never do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
I just didn’t tell him	Anis itti hin himne qofa
But I didn't tell anyone	Ani garuu namatti hin himne
Right now she has nothing.	Yeroo ammaa kana isheen waan tokkollee hin qabdu.
But it’s not yours.	Garuu kan kee miti.
There wasn't much light.	Ifa baay'ee hin turre.
I think tomorrow is going to be a good day	Boru guyyaa gaarii ta'uuf deema jedheen yaada
It’s just on one important part.	Kutaa barbaachisaa tokko qofa irra jira.
I think she can do it this time	Yeroo kana isheen ni danda'a jedheen yaada
I can still get it as they have	Ammallee akkuma isaan qaban argachuu nan danda'a
It's not even about this.	Waa'ee kanaa illee miti.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
I’m not interested in the answer.	Deebii isaaf fedhii hin qabu.
I mean other than the present.	Yeroo ammaa malee kan biraa jechuu kooti.
I couldn't believe what was happening	Waan ta'aa jiru amanuu hin dandeenye
Except that he is not.	Inni inni hin taane malee.
It's just one thing.	Waan tokko qofa.
I knew he wanted to live	Jiraachuu akka barbaadu nan beeka ture
He had to see with his own two eyes.	Ija ofii lamaan arguu qaba ture.
I wonder what he will do	Maal godha jedheen yaada
So they know better than she does how to mother.	Kanaaf, akkamitti haadha taʼuu akka qaban ishee caalaa beeku.
I know we can make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuu akka dandeenyu nan beeka.
I hope you are doing well	Akka gaariitti akka jirtu abdiin qaba
So I know you’re new.	Kanaaf haaraa akka taate nan beeka.
I'm not saying that it will	Akka ta'u jechuu koo miti
I didn’t know what to make of it.	Maal akkan itti godhu hin beeku ture.
This one was otherwise different.	Kan kana malee adda ture.
I didn’t really understand	Dhuguma hin hubanne
They are not children.	Ijoollee miti.
We really don’t have time to stay any longer.	Dhuguma kana booda turuuf yeroo hin qabnu.
But one thing is clear.	Wanti tokko garuu ifaadha.
I had no idea what was going on	Waan deemaa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It was all just, it was the whole thing.	Hundi isaa qofa ture, waan guutuu ture.
That was entirely their job.	Guutummaatti hojii isaanii kanuma ture.
Who wants to know.	Eenyu beekuu barbaada.
But things are different.	Garuu wanti jiru adda.
We need this guy.	Gurbaa kana nu barbaachisa.
You just can’t leave her.	Ishee dhiisuu qofa hin dandeessu.
The obvious thing that is true.	Wanti ifa ta'e kan dhugaa jiru.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
I told her, but she didn’t care	Anis itti hime, garuu isheen dhimma hin qabdu
I want to leave it to him	Isaaf dhiisuu barbaada
I was the one in the wrong	Ani isa dogoggora keessa ture
This was not the case	Kun akkas hin turre
This time it could be me.	Yeroo kana ana ta'uu danda'a.
I think maybe he knew	Tarii ni beeka ture jedheen yaada
I love working on them.	Isaan irratti hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
They have a real problem.	Rakkoo dhugaa jiru qabu.
I think he wants to get food	Nyaata argachuu barbaada jedheen yaada
It's been a lot.	Baay'ee ta'e.
I could have, you know	Ani qabaachuu nan danda'a ture, beekta
She has many people waiting for them.	Namoota hedduu isaan eegaa jiru qabdi.
You wouldn’t have thought of that.	Silaa kana hin yaaddu ture.
You are one of us.	Ati nu keessaa tokko.
A really great idea.	Yaada dhuguma guddaa ta'e.
I told him it was a good idea	Anis yaada gaarii akka taʼe itti hime
But it wants to be.	Garuu ta'uu barbaada.
I know now that she was right.	Dhugaa akka turte amma beeka.
His own father.	Abbaa ofii.
He searches the room desperately	Kutaa sana keessa akka malee barbaada
I am very interested in your comments	Yaada keessan kanaaf baay'een fedhii qaba
But this is not entirely correct.	Garuu kun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
But that was a mistake.	Garuu sun dogoggora ture.
He definitely wants it to be him more than anything.	Waan hundumaa caalaa isa akka ta'u akka barbaadu beekamaadha.
She had to be someone else.	Nama biraa ta'uu qabdi turte.
You can talk about it in the interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii irratti dubbachuu dandeessu.
I know this is true	Kun dhugaa ta'uu nan beeka
It was in the morning.	Ganama ture.
I don't know who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku.
A threat to his career.	Balaa hojii isaaf ta’u.
I couldn’t get much of a response from my father	Abbaa koo irraa deebii guddaa argachuu hin dandeenye
But look at everyone.	Garuu nama hunda ilaalaa.
That’s nothing new.	Sun waan haaraa miti.
Still inside.	Ammas keessa.
Everyone in the place seemed to know her.	Bakka sana jiru hundi waan ishee beeku fakkaata ture.
As if it were.	Akka waan.
I had no idea how to do it	Akkamitti akkan godhu yaada hin qabu ture
I didn’t know he was coming, either.	Anis akka inni dhufu hin beeku ture,
Now she was different.	Amma adda turte.
It’s been around for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf jira.
I love you, mother.	Si jaalladha haadha.
This can be serious.	Kun hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
He may still be around	Ammallee naannoo koo jiraachuu danda'a
I couldn’t say anything else.	Waan biraa jechuu hin dandeenye.
He did something for you	Waan tokko siif godhe
She doesn't have any.	Isheen tokkollee hin qabdu.
I know something is going on	Waan tokko akka deemaa jiru nan beeka
Nothing would happen today.	Har'a homaa hin ta'u ture.
That looked pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
' ' they say.	' ' jedhu.
I need someone.	Nama na barbaachisa.
Return to him.	Gara isaatti deebi'i.
Mostly, people are just curious.	Irra caalaa namoonni fedhii qofa qabu.
I know about these things	Waa'ee wantoota kanaa nan beeka
We were on our way then.	Yeroo sanatti karaa irra turre.
But I don't understand why	Maaliif akka ta'e garuu naaf hin galle
But it was so, so much.	Garuu baay'ee, baay'ee ture.
But there could be two of them.	Garuu isaan keessaa lama ta’uu danda’u.
I love everything in there	Waan achi keessa jiru hunda nan jaalladha
I hoped he was right	Sirrii akka ta'e abdiin qaba ture
It was better this time.	Yeroo kana wayya ture.
He just loves life.	Jireenya qofa jaallata.
This just isn’t working.	Kun qofa hojjechaa hin jiru.
I can't tell you much more right now	Yeroo ammaa kana kana caalaa waan baay'ee sitti himuu hin danda'u
He says he will.	Ni godha jedha.
I need a place.	Bakka na barbaachisa.
He has a desire.	Fedhii qaba.
Truth, nothing but truth.	Dhugaa, dhugaa malee homaa miti.
That seemed like a lot at the time.	Sun yeroo sanatti waan baay'ee fakkaata ture.
I had my job.	Hojii koo qaba ture.
He wanted something.	Waan tokko barbaade.
I didn’t understand why she did that at the time	Yeroo sanatti maaliif akkas akka goote naaf hin galle
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I wouldn’t have thought of that	Silaa akkas hin yaadu ture
I can't believe this is my home	Kun mana kooti jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
Something wasn’t quite right.	Wanti tokko guutummaatti sirrii hin turre.
It was the worst thing he could have said.	Waan inni jechuu danda'u hunda caalaa hamaa ture.
I still didn’t even have a car.	Ammallee konkolaataa illee hin qabu ture.
Like her father.	Akkuma abbaa ishee.
Simple stuff really	Waan salphaa dhuguma
I knew you would	Akka ati gootu nan beeka ture
We didn’t notice you there.	Achitti si hin hubanne turre.
In his case, they were not.	Dhimma isaa irratti isaan hin turre.
She needs her sleep.	Hirriba ishee ishee barbaachisa.
Not that they do this time.	Yeroo kana ni godhu jechuu miti.
I know what we can do	Waan gochuu dandeenyu nan beeka
I wasn't being different.	Ani adda ta'aa hin turre.
I didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
He didn't do it for me	Naaf hin goone
He wasn’t alone.	Inni kophaa isaa hin turre.
He said he did that a month ago	Ji'a tokko dura akkas godhe jedhe
I want to know about you today	Har'a waa'ee kee beekuu barbaada
You have to work for it.	Isaaf hojjechuu qabda.
Maybe even both.	Tarii lamaan isaanii illee ta’uu danda’a.
It seems to be here now.	Amma waan as jiru fakkaata.
You have to help her.	Ishee gargaaruu qabda.
But it's not the important one.	Garuu isa barbaachisaa ta'e miti.
I don't have to be.	Ani dirqama ta'uu hin qabu.
He wasn’t good enough.	Inni gaarii hin turre.
You know their names.	Maqaa isaanii ni beektu.
None of them were doing that.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee akkas gochaa hin turre.
They all knew him.	Hundi isaanii isa beeku turan.
I have my car here	Konkolaataa koo asitti qaba
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
There is nothing problematic about this.	Kana irratti wanti rakkoo qabu hin jiru.
I wondered who it was	Eenyu jedheen yaade
It’s not easy at work.	Hojii irratti salphaa miti.
Almost to do that	Sana hojjechuuf jechuun ni danda'ama
Not that it was a good thing.	Waan gaarii ture jechuu miti.
He didn't talk about me at all.	Waa'ee koo tasumaa hin dubbanne.
He didn't tell anyone	Namatti hin himne
It's just different.	Adda qofa.
I should have told you about them	Silaa waa'ee isaanii sitti himuu qaba ture
Yet.	Ammallee.
You don't know how it's going to happen.	Akkamitti akka ta'u hin beektu.
I could find someone who knew me	Nama na beeku argachuu danda'a ture
I'm good at it.	Ani irratti ga'umsa qaba.
I intend to do exactly that	Anis sirriitti akkas gochuuf yaada
He is so alone.	Inni akkas kophaa isaa jira.
I think that's for sure	Sun mirkanaa'aa natti fakkaata
I know she was, but look at them	Isheen akka turte nan beeka, garuu isaan ilaalaa
But this was not the case.	Kun garuu akkas hin turre.
He could hardly see.	Inni baayʼee arguu hin dandeenye.
I don’t really know what the real reason was.	Sababni dhugaa maal akka ture sirriitti hin beeku.
It seemed so right at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas sirrii fakkaata ture.
I don't know many people.	Nama baay'ee hin beeku.
A book people should buy.	Kitaaba namoonni bitachuu qabu.
I'm still not sure that's the case.	Ammallee akkas ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I don't want to.	Ani hin barbaadu.
I thought it was very neat	Baayyee sirrii natti fakkaate
No one was there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf namni achi hin turre.
That has certainly come up before.	Sun kanaan dura akka dhufe beekamaadha.
You can tell me.	Natti himuu dandeessu.
It was like that, I'm sure.	Akkas ture, mirkanaa'aa dha.
I have your daughter in my arms	Intala kee harka kootti qaba
Often this isn’t enough.	Yeroo baay’ee kun gahaa miti.
I always knew about it	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee isaa beeka
It hadn’t gone badly.	Hamaa hin deemne ture.
He must give his name.	Maqaa isaa kennuu qaba.
I want more children	Ijoollee baay'een barbaada
That means it needs some work.	Kana jechuun hojii tokko tokko barbaada.
You can get a job up here.	As ol hojii argachuu dandeessa.
About what really matters in life.	Waa'ee waan jireenya keessatti dhuguma barbaachisaa ta'e.
He did what he had to do.	Waan gochuu qabu hojjete.
I have a long day today	Har'a guyyaa dheeraa qaba
I don’t do it.	Hin godhu.
He wanted to know what it was like	Maal akka fakkaatu beekuu barbaade
They are still in great shape.	Ammallee haala guddaa keessa jiru.
I've never been too sure about that.	Waa'ee sanaa garmalee mirkanaa'aa ta'ee hin beeku.
I don't need this thing	Wanti kun na hin barbaachisu
I want you, you are mine	Si barbaada, ati kan kooti
You know what can help us.	Waan nu gargaaruu danda'u beekta.
You know the truth.	Dhugaa jiru ni beekta.
It should be up there now.	Amma achi ol ta'uu qaba.
I just need a couple of days	Guyyaa lama lama qofa na barbaachisa
But of this right now.	Garuu kana keessaa yeroo ammaa.
He looked at his teacher for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf barsiisaa isaa ilaale.
I hoped that was all	Kana qofa akka ta'e abdiin qaba ture
I wondered if he was looking for me	Na barbaadaa turee jedheen yaade
We are much better now.	Amma baayyee caalaa jirra.
You have to walk on it.	Irra deemuu qabda.
Everything and everyone is in there, except me.	Wanti hundi fi namni hundi achi keessa jira, ana malee.
They had no such job.	Isaan kun hojii akkasii hin qaban turan.
He got another drink.	Dhugaatii biraa argate.
It was her father.	Abbaa ishee ture.
He took the easy stuff.	Waan salphaa fudhate.
That’s just me.	Sun ana qofa.
Not a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura miti.
I know he still loves me	Ammallee akka na jaallatu nan beeka
I hope not but who knows	Akka hin taane abdiin qaba garuu eenyutu beeka
I couldn't believe it	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye
Three, two, one.	Sadii, lama, tokko.
Which is true, you can.	Kan dhugaa ta'e, ni dandeessa.
Sometimes that’s the case.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas ta’a.
And I mean mostly	Anis irra caalaa jechuu kooti
She obviously knew.	Isheen akka beektu ifaadha.
This doesn’t happen often.	Kun yeroo baay’ee hin ta’u.
The reason is obvious.	Sababni isaa ifaadha.
He had nothing against the girl	Intala sana irratti homaa hin qabu ture
Obviously not in my house.	Mana koo keessatti akka hin taane ifaadha.
But not anymore.	Kana booda garuu miti.
But this is not the case here.	Kun garuu asitti hin jiru.
It's not about the environment.	Waa'ee naannoo miti.
I am still in trouble like my father	Ammas akkuma abbaa kootti rakkoo keessa jira
I think that’s a mistake	Sun dogoggora natti fakkaata
It had nothing that anyone here would want	Waan namni as jiru barbaadu tokkollee hin qabu ture
I knew your mother in those days.	Haadha kee bara sana nan beeka ture.
Tell me a little about that.	Waa'ee sanaa xiqqoo natti himi.
I was happy with that.	Sanatti gammade.
But not for very long.	Garuu baayyee dheeraaf miti.
That I’m not anymore.	Akka ani kana booda hin taane.
He didn’t have any job	Hojii tokkollee hin qabu ture
Where is?.	Eessa jira?.
I just wasn’t that person.	Ani nama sana qofa hin turre.
It seems to be the same.	Kanuma fakkaata.
He knew it would never happen.	Yoomiyyuu akka hin taane beeka ture.
A little noise.	Sagalee xiqqoo.
It is somewhat accurate.	Hamma tokko sirrii dha.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
I couldn't go back much further	Kana caalaa baay'ee duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
It was just a matter of getting the job done.	Dhimma hojii sana hojjechuu qofa ture.
I went through a lot of things	Waan hedduu keessa darbe
Nothing came from them.	Wanti isaan irraa dhufe hin jiru.
No one here does that.	Asitti namni akkas godhu hin jiru.
He should have told her	Silaa itti himuu qaba ture
He may be able to help us.	Inni nu gargaaruu dandaʼa taʼa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
Except he didn't.	Hin goone malee.
But I can't say anymore	Kana booda garuu jechuu hin danda'u
I think everyone has so that can't be it	Namni hundi waan qabu natti fakkaata kanaaf sun ta'uu hin danda'u
They can say that.	Kana jechuun ni danda’u.
Place of time.	Bakka yeroo.
You don’t have them.	Isaan hin qabdu.
No one had told him.	Namni itti hime hin turre.
I’m here to help you.	Si gargaaruuf as jira.
No one seemed to be in the house.	Namni mana keessa jiru hin fakkaatu ture.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
I could totally be in this room	Ani guutummaatti kutaa kana keessa jiraachuu nan danda'a ture
I still have school in the morning	Ammallee ganama mana barumsaa qaba
This looks pretty bad.	Kun baayyee hamaa fakkaata.
I don’t have parents.	Warra hin qabu.
I didn't know her	Ani ishee hin beekne
I want to talk to you about this.	Waa'ee kanaa sitti dubbachuu barbaada.
I had to be one.	Ani tokko ta'uu qaba ture.
But we have what we have.	Garuu waan qabnu qabna.
It started out well.	Akka gaariitti jalqabe.
But it’s not mine.	Garuu kan koo miti.
Still haven't seen who did it	Ammallee eenyu akka godhe hin argine
I knew he was one of us	Inni nu keessaa tokko akka taʼe nan beeka ture
I think that was too obvious	Sun garmalee ifa ture jedheen yaada
I don’t want risk here.	Asitti balaa hin barbaadu.
But this was not the case.	Kun garuu akkas hin turre.
I just wanted it this time.	Yeroo kana qofa barbaade.
I'm saying this.	Ani kana jedha.
A lot had happened.	Waan baay'een ta'ee ture.
That hasn’t happened yet this year.	Sun bara kana ammallee hin taane.
I should be enough for you	Ani siif gahaa ta'uu qaba
I wasn't in the mood for a retreat	Miira duubatti deebi'uu keessa hin turre
I wonder how many languages ​​he speaks	Afaan meeqa dubbata jedheen yaada
I was.	Ani ... ture.
She said that before.	Duraan akkas jette.
You have to have the same things.	Wantoota wal fakkaatu qabaachuu qabda.
You can't come here.	As dhufuu hin dandeessu.
But he didn't know.	Garuu hin beeku ture.
You.	Ati.
That was good enough for him.	Sun isaaf gaarii ture.
I’m not really into it anymore.	Dhuguma kana booda achi keessa hin galle.
They were good kids.	Ijoollee gaarii turan.
I always loved her	Yeroo hundumaa ishee nan jaalladha ture
But there was no one in there.	Garuu namni achi keessa hin turre.
I enjoyed it.	Itti gammadeera.
Perhaps you should ask yourself why.	Tarii maaliif akka taʼe of gaafachuu qabda taʼa.
I really think you do	Dhuguma ni gootu jedheen yaada
I think it's very, very lucky.	Baayyee baayyee carraa qaba jedheen yaada.
It’s not a mistake.	Dogoggora miti.
You can see me.	Na arguu dandeessu.
People wanted that kind of thing.	Namoonni waan akkasii barbaada ture.
Better get her.	Ishee argachuu wayya.
I’m trying to do it well	Ani akka gaariitti hojjechuuf yaalaa jira
I didn’t want him to know, not ever	Ani akka inni beeku hin barbaanne, yoomiyyuu miti
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
I can't tell you much about it	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee sitti himuu hin danda'u
That would be one thing.	Sun waan tokko ta'a.
But something else just happened.	Garuu wanti biraa amma ta'e.
It would never have been necessary.	Silaa gonkumaa barbaachisaa hin ta’u ture.
It was at the right door	Balbala sirrii irra ture
And I did the same thing.	Anis akkas godhe.
But he couldn't say.	Garuu jechuu hin dandeenye.
I’m glad I didn’t say anything	Homaa dubbachuu dhiisuu kootti gammadeera
That’s how you are.	Akkas jirtu.
I didn’t want to talk anymore	Kana booda dubbachuu hin barbaanne
I knew one was coming	Tokko akka dhufu nan beeka ture
We have two cars there right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana konkolaataa lama achitti qabna.
I think of him often	Yeroo baay'ee isa nan yaada
I didn’t mean any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee jechuu koo hin turre
He is not a bad man.	Nama hamaa miti.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
I can't talk about it right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
I really didn’t know what to tell him	Dhuguma maal akkan itti himu hin beeku ture
Maybe they should just let things happen.	Tarii waan tokko akka ta'u qofa dhiisuu qabu ta'a.
I knew those eyes.	Ija sana nan beeka ture.
I need this countdown clock.	Sa'aatii duubatti deebi'uu kana na barbaachisa.
He was a man.	Inni nama ture.
I knew what was going on here	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru nan beeka ture
We met on the road outside their house.	Karaa mana isaanii ala jiru irratti wal argine.
Maybe with food.	Tarii nyaata waliin ta'uu danda'a.
I can't get any clear idea	Yaada ifa ta'e tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u
I don’t know why that isn’t the case.	Maaliif akkas akka hin taane hin beeku.
She certainly did.	Isheen akka goote beekamaadha.
I know that exactly.	Sana sirriitti beeka.
Is it really there???.	Dhuguma jiraa???.
They could see him.	Isa arguu dandaʼu turan.
They were real.	Isaan dhugaa turan.
It just didn’t seem right.	Qofa sirrii hin fakkaatu ture.
I didn’t think she had it in her	Isheen keessa waan qabdu natti hin fakkaatu ture
It should have been with you	Silaa si waliin ta'uu qaba ture
I mean, tomorrow morning	Boru ganama jechuu kooti
He was a man.	Inni nama ture.
But for him, this is no problem.	Isaaf garuu kun rakkoo hin qabu.
I was with her for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ishee waliin ture.
I doubt it matters	Dhimma akka hin qabne nan shakka
But not in my case.	Garuu dhimma koo irratti miti.
He knows exactly where he’s been all along	Yeroo hundumaa eessa akka ture sirriitti beeka
He says his is mine.	Kan isaa kan kooti jedha.
Nothing dangerous, so nothing matters.	Wanti balaa qabu hin jiru, kanaaf wanti dhimma qabu hin jiru.
This doesn't help.	Kun hin gargaaru.
But I can't live in the past	Ani garuu waan darbe jiraachuu hin danda'u
But you know someone.	Garuu nama beekta.
He hadn't talked much about his book.	Waa'ee kitaaba isaa baay'ee hin dubbanne ture.
We are outside.	Nuti ala jirra.
He thought he could do this	Kana gochuu nan danda'a jedhee yaade
I only saw the light of it.	Ifa isaa qofa arge.
I absolutely love this one	Isa kana guutummaatti nan jaalladha
It wasn’t always there.	Yeroo hundumaa hin turre.
It works a good amount.	Hamma gaarii hojjeta.
It certainly was.	Akka ture beekamaadha.
I know the place.	Bakka sana nan beeka.
But nothing seems to help.	Garuu wanti gargaaru hin fakkaatu.
You wouldn’t even think it would be on.	Silaa irra jira jettee illee hin yaaddu turte.
I wasn't sure where.	Eessa akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
That should have helped.	Sun gargaaruu qaba ture.
Not even us.	Nu illee miti.
I still wanted to be with him.	Ammallee isa waliin taʼuu nan barbaada ture.
What was it.	Maal ture.
This was going to be bad.	Kun hamaa ta'uuf ture.
I don't know why anyone wants this job.	Hojii kana namni barbaadu maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
That was some time ago.	Sun yeroo muraasa dura ture.
But it would have been dangerous.	Garuu silaa balaa qaba ture.
I couldn’t find this either	Anis kana argachuu hin dandeenye
I don't understand your question	Gaaffii keessan naaf hin galle
His life.	Jireenya isaa.
He said it wasn't.	Akka hin taane jedhe.
I think she knew what was going to happen too.	Isheen illee waan ta'uuf jiru waan beektu natti fakkaata.
It’s not what I want.	Kan ani barbaadu miti.
This never happens in the present book.	Kitaaba ammaa kana keessatti kun gonkumaa hin ta’u.
It sounds like you guys really have it together.	Isin dhuguma waliin qabdu fakkaata.
I can't believe you do all this	Kana hunda akka gootu amanuu hin danda'u
Now you have it.	Amma qabda.
If it's bigger than that, all the better.	Yoo kana caalaa guddaa ta'e hunda caalaa gaarii dha.
I’m not like that.	Ani akkas miti.
It’s not new.	Haaraa miti.
I am the one here with you	Si waliin kan as jiru ana
Not that she needs to.	Isheen barbaachisa jechuu miti.
Always, always have, always am	Yeroo hundumaa, yeroo hundumaa qaba, yeroo hundumaa nan jira
I was a good wife to him	Ani isaaf haadha manaa gaarii ture
I didn’t even have to say anything	Homaa dubbachuu illee hin qabu ture
That certainly can do it.	Sun gochuu akka dandaʼu beekamaadha.
I know what’s ahead of me	Waan na dura jiru nan beeka
But there is no time.	Garuu yeroon hin jiru.
This is by no means an exception.	Kun tasumaa kanaan ala miti.
I don't know if it really happened.	Dhuguma ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
But this is very wrong.	Garuu kun baayyee dogoggora.
They are on the road.	Karaa irra jiru.
Husband and father.	Abbaa manaa fi abbaa.
But she couldn't leave me.	Isheen garuu na dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
She had plenty of time.	Yeroo hedduu qabdi turte.
It doesn't help	Hin gargaaru .
I know they were working on that.	Sana irratti hojjechaa akka turan nan beeka.
It doesn't mean he can.	Danda'a jechuu miti.
They could have a mouth.	Afaan qabaachuu danda'u turan.
I want to talk to you about that	Waa'ee sanaa sitti dubbachuu barbaada
It has two parts.	Kutaa lama qaba.
I really want to go with you to walk her	Ishee deemuuf si waliin deemuun baay'een barbaada
I can see that in him sometimes.	Sana yeroo tokko tokko isa keessatti arguu nan danda'a.
I won't be myself anymore.	Kana booda ofii koo hin ta'u.
We had a car.	Konkolaataa qabna turre.
This was not easy.	Kun salphaa hin turre.
Not sure what we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu mirkanaa'aa miti.
I don't have such a chance.	Carraa akkasii hin qabu.
So much so.	Hanga kana.
I didn’t want to ask any more questions	Kana booda gaaffii gaafachuu hin barbaanne
He loved life.	Jireenya ni jaallata ture.
Why is it obvious.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekamaadha.
I want to do it again	Ammas gochuun barbaada
I didn't mean to be so mean to you	Akkasitti sitti hamaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
I didn’t see you there.	Achitti si hin argine.
I didn’t even see him	Isa illee hin argine
He seemed like a different person	Nama adda ta'e fakkaata ture
But it was over three hours.	Garuu sa'aatii sadii ol ture.
That wouldn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu ture.
I need you to forgive me	Dhiifama akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa
You have to be bad before you can be good.	Gaarii ta'uu kee dura hamaa ta'uu qabda.
I know exactly who you are	Eenyu akka taate sirriitti beeka
You know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e ni beekta.
He may be gone for hours	Sa'aatii dheeraaf hin jiru ta'a
Like a good guy.	Akka gurbaa gaarii.
That was the moment.	Yeroon sun yeroo sana ture.
A door, it seemed	Balbala tokko, fakkaata ture
I really didn't know why	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I had no idea about that.	Waa'ee sanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Tomorrow is the day.	Boru guyyaa dha.
I thought I did but I wanted to say it	Anis jedheen yaade garuu jechuu barbaade
We had to live with someone else.	Nama biraa wajjin jiraachuu qabna turre.
But, something happens.	Garuu, wanti tokko ta'a.
We are all trying.	Hundi keenya yaalaa jirra.
I can't believe this worked	Kun hojjete jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
That didn’t mean anything bad.	Jechuun waan hamaa jechuu hin turre.
I didn’t want any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
I was waiting for this moment	Yeroo kana eegaa ture
We still have each other.	Ammas wal qabna.
I really didn’t think about any of this	Dhuguma kana keessaa tokkollee itti hin yaadne
But he didn't understand.	Garuu hin hubanne.
Not many people could keep up with him.	Namoonni baay'een isa waliin deemuu hin dandeenye.
I don’t like good people.	Namoota gaarii hin jaalladhu.
They know him very well	Baay'ee isa beeku
So week.	Kanaaf torban.
There is no one here.	Asitti nama malee jira.
They can still do that.	Ammas sana gochuu dandaʼu.
Not much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee miti.
But he made a mistake.	Garuu dogoggora hojjete.
He never went to.	Inni gonkumaa gara.
I know all your thoughts	Yaada kee hunda nan beeka
I really love you so much	Dhuguma baay'een si jaalladha
I said I like it	Naaf tola jedheen
I haven’t for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf hin qabu
There is nothing about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin jiru.
Very soon hopefully.	Baayyee yeroo dhiyootti abdii qabna.
All the same, he knew it was there.	Hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu, achi akka jiru ni beeka ture.
I didn’t want to leave it in the car	Konkolaataa keessa dhiisuu hin barbaanne
Go back inside.	Keessatti deebi'i.
This was not extreme	Kun garmalee hin turre
It was a terrible time.	Yeroon sun yeroo hamaa ture.
We still don't have it.	Ammallee hin qabnu.
I couldn't have asked for anything more	Kana caalaa waan tokko gaafachuu hin danda'u ture
I wanted to find something new	Waan haaraa argachuu barbaade
I was with you all day	Guyyaa guutuu si waliin ture
We are still on it.	Ammas irra jirra.
I didn’t know what to make of me	Maal akka na godhu hin beeku ture
But it was a big mistake.	Garuu dogoggora guddaa ture.
Maybe that will see her through this, maybe not.	Tarii sun kana keessa ishee arguu danda'a, tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
But really nothing more.	Garuu dhuguma kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
He’s that guy now.	Inni amma gurbaa sana.
It was the sound of his voice.	Sagalee sagalee isaa ture.
A real person would never do that	Namni dhugaa gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf.
That was nothing.	Sun homaa hin turre.
I can't do that from here	As irraa akkas gochuu hin danda'u
I think he already knows	Inni duruu waan beeku natti fakkaata
I know them very well	Baay'ee isaan beeka
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
If it's for you, that's it.	Yoo siif ta'e kanuma.
I couldn’t afford one at the time.	Yeroo sanatti tokko bitachuu hin dandeenye.
It wasn’t long enough.	Dheeraa gahaa hin turre.
It’s a bit risky, though.	Xiqqoo balaa qaba, garuu.
Tall father.	Abbaa dheeraa.
I had no idea what that meant	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
Now you know everyone there.	Amma nama achi jiru hunda ni beekta.
Just a little bit .	Xiqqoo qofa .
I wanted more than that	Kana caalaa nan barbaada ture
You will love Him.	Isa ni jaallattu.
I wasn’t myself at all	Ani tasumaa ofii koo hin turre
I know that sounds bad	Sun hamaa akka fakkaatu nan beeka
A very long time ago	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa dura
I wouldn't be here today	Silaa har'a as hin jiru ture
They really do matter.	Isaan dhuguma dhimma qabu.
I mean each other	Wal jechuu kooti .
I hadn’t noticed him before.	Kanaan dura isa hin hubanne ture.
A tiny little thing with a great big noise.	Waan xiqqoo xiqqoo sagalee guddaa guddaa qabu.
Father.	Abbaa.
As she knows.	Akkuma isheen beektu.
A month later he was a veteran.	Ji'a tokko booda nama durii ture.
I don't understand anything	Ani homaa naaf hin galle
It's almost one.	Tokko jechuun ni danda'ama.
I have some idea of ​​how time works	Yeroon akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada tokko tokko qaba
People like him shouldn’t even exist.	Namoonni akka isaa jiraachuu illee hin qaban.
It wasn’t a long-term one.	Kan yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I was thinking that	Ani akkas jedheen yaada ture
But they are not the same.	Garuu isaan tokko miti.
I have to do the right thing	Waan sirrii taʼe gochuun qaba
They love to play.	Taphachuu ni jaallatu.
We have people on the road.	Namoota karaa irra jiru qabna.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
Which was probably.	Kan tarii ture.
He certainly knew that.	Kana akka beeku beekamaadha.
And she did this again.	Ammas kana goote.
I wanted to make it small.	Xiqqoo akka ta'u gochuun barbaade.
If this is the case, I'm sorry.	Yoo kun ta'e dhiifama.
They want things they can’t have.	Wantoota qabaachuu hin dandeenye barbaadu.
Which will be very good.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'a.
What is it that is.	Maaltu dha.
We have been in operation for three years.	Waggaa sadii guutuu hojii irra turre.
We are all going.	Hundi keenya deemaa jirra.
I didn’t know there was that much.	Hangas akka jiru hin beeku ture.
There was nothing obvious.	Wanti ifa ta'e hin turre.
There will be something.	Waan tokko ni jiraata.
That’s just who we are.	Eenyu akka taane qofa kanuma.
So, we are waiting for you.	Kanaaf, isin eegaa jirra.
This is what happened in our case.	Dhimma keenya keessatti kan ta'e kana.
Good luck.	Carraa gaarii.
She had it.	Isheen qabdi turte.
It works better than that.	Kana caalaa hojjeta.
But I can do this	Kana garuu gochuu nan danda'a
It worked for us today	Har'a nuuf hojjete
I can't back out of it now	Amma keessaa duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
They are my friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota kooti.
But on another job.	Garuu hojii biraa irratti.
There was no one else to go to.	Namni biraa itti deemu hin turre.
School next week, no excuses.	Torban dhufu mana barumsaa, sababa hin qabu.
So they must be bigger than us.	Kanaaf isaan nu caalaa guddaa ta’uu qabu.
I just love you.	Si jaalladha qofa.
This is very good.	Kun baayyee gaarii dha.
I think we have a problem	Rakkoo qabna jedheen yaada
But now he knows the truth.	Amma garuu dhugaa jiru beeka.
I can't have you in my house anymore	Kana booda mana koo keessa si qabaachuu hin danda'u
They know two things.	Waan lama beeku.
She had no mother.	Haadha hin qabdu turte.
It was a long day.	Guyyaa dheeraa ture.
He wasn’t like that.	Inni akkas hin turre.
I know you still love me	Ammallee akka na jaallattu nan beeka
She would be such a good mother.	Haadha gaarii akkasii ta'a.
You can’t keep up with him.	Isa waliin deemuu hin dandeessu.
We did well out of three.	Sadii keessaa waan gaarii hojjenne.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
I just didn’t want to forgive him	Dhiifama isaaf gochuu qofa hin barbaanne
But then it’s not like that.	Garuu sana booda akkas miti.
I met someone who knew you.	Nama si beeku waliin wal arge.
I can't see anything else	Waan biraa arguu hin danda'u
It's very lucky.	Baay'ee carraa qaba.
I just knew it was	Ani garuu akka ta'e nan beeka ture
It's just a joke.	Qoosaa qofa.
You know how it can happen.	Akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u beekta.
We are not like you.	Nuti akka kee miti.
My kids, my husband and myself.	Ijoollee koo, abbaa manaa koo fi ofii koo.
I hope they were all good	Hundi isaanii gaarii akka turan abdiin qaba
I wish it was, but it's not	Osoo ta'ee natti tola, garuu akkas miti
I knew it wouldn’t last long	Yeroo dheeraa akka hin turre nan beeka ture
But everything is not so simple.	Garuu wanti hundi akkas salphaa miti.
It was a problem of time.	Rakkoo yeroo ture.
I was just trying something	Waan tokko qofa yaalaa ture
I told him again.	Ammas itti hime.
Then it’s nothing.	Sana booda homaa miti.
He did three things.	Waan sadii hojjete.
I never said that.	Jedhee hin beeku.
They need food.	Nyaata isaan barbaachisa.
I think you should know this	Kana beekuu qabdu jedheen yaada
You don't want to know about that.	Waa'ee sanaa beekuu hin barbaaddu.
Which is	Kan ta'e .
He looked into her eyes	Ija ishee ilaale
You are in good shape.	Haala gaarii keessa jirta.
It's just a question.	Gaaffii qofa.
No one looked at her.	Namni ishee ilaale hin jiru.
People knew them.	Namoonni isaan beeku turan.
But not just yet.	Garuu amma qofa miti.
I won't tell you again	Ammas sitti hin himu
We would just have to drive together.	Silaa konkolaataa waliin deemuu qofa qabna turre.
Nothing, of course.	Homaa miti, beekamaadha.
He knew this well	Kana sirriitti beeka ture
Not in your own home.	Mana ofii keessa miti.
I really don’t need it.	Dhuguma na hin barbaachisu.
I can't believe it's in my house	Mana koo keessa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I just can't seem to make it work.	Ani garuu akka hojjetu gochuu hin danda'u natti fakkaata.
This had to be him.	Kun isa ta’uu qaba ture.
There may be.	Jiraachuu danda'a.
A new wife.	Haadha manaa haaraa.
In real life, however, this is not the case.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti garuu kun hin ta'u.
I think it should be good	Gaarii ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
I know what that feels like	Sun maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka
I can't see him now.	Amma isa arguu hin danda'u.
Twice in two weeks.	Torban lama keessatti yeroo lama.
He could have been more helpful.	Silaa isa caalaa gargaaruu dandaʼa ture.
Then again, just like my father.	Sana booda ammas akkuma abbaa kooti.
I absolutely love you so much.	Guutummaatti baay'een si jaalladha.
Not even that.	Kana illee miti.
That someone was a mother.	Namni tokko haadha akka ture.
I told him exactly what it was.	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti itti hime.
I almost couldn't ask	Gaafachuu hin dandeenye jechuun ni danda'ama
That’s not a good time.	Yeroon sun yeroo gaarii miti.
It has everything working well.	Waan hundumaa akka gaariitti hojjetu qaba.
That was all he said.	Dubbate kana qofa ture.
I am not such a person.	Ani nama akkasii miti.
I could just walk in it	Isa keessa deemuu qofa nan danda'a ture
I was not one of them	Ani isaan keessaa tokko hin turre
They shouldn’t have any problems.	Rakkoo tokkollee qabaachuu hin qaban.
She was just a girl at the time.	Yeroo sanatti intala qofa turte.
Often more than enough.	Yeroo baayyee gahaa ol ta'a.
They have to go together.	Waliin deemuu qabu.
But maybe it didn't matter.	Garuu tarii homaa hin turre ta'a.
I hope he's not on his way back	Karaa deebi'uu irra akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
I hadn’t known her in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee hin beekne ture
I think it worked well	Akka gaariitti waan hojjete natti fakkaata
There is nothing to say.	Waan jedhu hin jiru.
In his life now.	Jireenya isaa keessatti amma.
They do this often.	Yeroo baay’ee kana godhu.
There was nothing else for him.	Wanti biraa isaaf hin turre.
We had a full afternoon.	Waaree booda guutuu qabna turre.
You don't know.	Hin beektu.
He should tell them not to	Akka hin goone itti himuu qaba
I wanted to make that clear	Sana ifa gochuun barbaade
None of these people think it’s a problem.	Namoota kana keessaa tokkollee rakkoo waan qabu itti hin fakkaatu.
I think you have a good idea	Yaada gaarii qabda jedheen yaada
We need to do something with you.	Waan tokko isin waliin gochuu qabna.
Looks like a good morning here.	Asitti ganama gaarii fakkaata.
She was a human being. 	Isheen nama turte. 
He saw what it looked like.	Maal akka fakkaatu arge.
I told you the truth	Dhugaa jiru sitti hime
That works for me.	Sun naaf hojjeta.
But it hadn’t happened.	Garuu hin taane ture.
Return with error.	Dogoggora waliin deebi'i.
They were inside.	Keessa turan.
I don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabu.
But, not everything is like that.	Garuu, wanti hundi akkas miti.
There are people like that out there.	Namoonni akkasii ala jiru.
I want him here right now	Yeroo ammaa kana asitti isa barbaada
That’s not exactly true.	Sun sirriitti dhugaa miti.
I was just a little girl	Ani intala xiqqoo qofa ture
Not the same guy.	Gurbaa tokko miti.
I suspect that is what is happening	Waan ta'aa jiru kanuma jedheen shakka
But it’s just what it is.	Garuu waan jiru qofa.
It wouldn't have mattered	Silaa dhimma hin qabu ture
I didn’t have a picture of him	Suuraa isaa hin qabu ture
I didn't think it was from him	Isa irraa waan ta'e natti hin fakkaatu ture
So we need your help.	Kanaaf gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa.
This was no easy task	Kun hojii salphaa hin turre
I know she does	Akka isheen gootu nan beeka
I thought I had you	Si qaba jedheen yaade
Things are never perfect, never perfect.	Wanti yoomiyyuu guutuu miti, yoomiyyuu guutuu miti.
But this is.	Garuu kun.
I thought about what you said in that room	Waan ati kutaa sana keessa jette itti yaade
Many of them.	Baay'ee isaanii.
But at the time, he was an important man.	Yeroo sanatti garuu, nama barbaachisaa ture.
But this is a new reality.	Garuu kun dhugaa haaraa dha.
It doesn’t matter why he did it.	Maaliif akka godhe homaa hin qabu.
The correct answer.	Deebii sirrii.
One says, this works well.	Tokko, kun akka gaariitti hojjeta jedha.
I don’t like little pictures.	Suuraa xiqqoo hin jaalladhu.
There will be opportunities.	Carraan ni jiraata.
I didn’t want to do that	Ani akkas gochuu hin barbaanne
This is a good place.	Kun bakka gaarii dha.
I knew their voices.	Sagalee isaanii nan beeka ture.
It wasn’t a bad idea though.	Yaada hamaa hin turre garuu.
It must be a good feeling, he thought.	Miira gaarii ta'uu hin oolu jedhee yaade.
You didn’t do anything.	Ati homaa hin hojjenne.
I have to ask you something.	Waan tokko si gaafachuu qaba.
I almost didn't want to go anymore	Kana booda deemuu hin barbaanne jechuun ni danda'ama
You can’t have a stranger in the house.	Mana keessa nama hin beekne qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
I’ve been here for a while now.	Amma yeroo muraasaaf as ture.
I think this will work	Kun ni hojjeta jedheen yaada
But I couldn't do it.	Ani garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
I have a lot of questions	Gaaffii baay'een qaba
Not in the past.	Yeroo darbe miti.
I had no idea what to say.	Maal jechuu akka qabu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
You don’t do that.	Ati akkas hin gootu.
I haven’t seen it before	Kanaan dura hin argine
There is only one thing you love more than yourself.	Ofii caalaa wanti ati jaallattu tokko qofa.
I'm not saying it's wrong	Dogoggora jechuu koo miti
That was all it was.	Kana qofa ture.
Three of them have the same mother.	Isaan keessaa sadii haadha tokko qabu.
I think that would be good	Sun gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
It should have been.	Silaa ta'uu qaba ture.
So that’s what he did.	Kanaaf waan inni godhe kanuma.
He knew it.	Inni beeka ture.
She was my father.	Isheen abbaa koo turte.
He should have helped those people	Silaa namoota sana gargaaruu qaba ture
I always wanted to be like my dad.	Yeroo hundumaa akka abbaa koo taʼuu nan barbaada ture.
I have it right here	Ani sirriitti asitti qaba
But that was fine.	Garuu sun gaarii ture.
It's not the same thing.	Waan tokko miti.
How many times was it.	Yeroo meeqa ture.
I know what you are not	Waan ati hin taane nan beeka
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
They were nothing.	Isaan homaa hin turre.
I could never tell anyone about it	Waa'ee isaa gonkumaa namatti himuu hin dandeenye
It was quite a day.	Guyyaa baay'ee ture.
I mean, just living together	Waliin jiraachuu qofa jechuu kooti
It seems we did what he couldn’t.	Waan inni hin dandeenye waan hojjenne fakkaata.
He came before anything else.	Inni waan biraa dura dhufe.
I won’t do this anymore	Kana booda kana hin godhu
I didn’t want to see him.	Isa arguu hin barbaanne.
I won't be with her	Ani ishee waliin hin ta'u
It doesn’t look like that here.	Asitti akkas hin fakkaatu.
But who else .	Garuu eenyu kan biraa .
I won’t do that to her	Ani akkas ishee hin godhu
I wasn't even sure she wanted me that way	Akkasitti akka na barbaaddu illee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I thought she wanted more	Kana caalaa waan barbaaddu natti fakkaate
I had no idea she was here	As akka jirtu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I didn't want to go home without one	Tokko malee gara manaatti deebi'uu hin barbaanne
Maybe she had.	Tarii qabdi turte ta'a.
I need another, another and another.	Kan biraa, kan biraa fi kan biraa na barbaachisa.
I’m really excited.	Dhuguma gammadeera.
I walk on the road.	Karaa irra nan deema.
She had to answer it.	Deebii itti kennuu qabdi turte.
I just thought you would love this place	Bakka kana ni jaallattu jedheen yaade qofa
I think it was a little bit of both	Xiqqoo lamaan isaanii ture jedheen yaada
But it doesn’t really work.	Garuu dhuguma hin hojjetu.
Tell me about it.	Waa'ee isaa natti himi.
If you do that.	Yoo akkas goote.
That could have been us.	Sun nu ta’uu danda’a ture.
He could have done many things to her.	Waan hedduu ishee irratti gochuu danda'a ture.
Doing something else.	Waan biraa hojjechuu.
He always wanted her	Yeroo hundumaa ishee barbaada ture
But that won't be enough.	Garuu sun gahaa hin ta'u.
I knew she wouldn’t fit	Isheen akka hin galle nan beeka ture
I looked around the bar	Anis naannoo mana dhugaatii sanaa ilaale
The problem was that the problem was too simple.	Rakkoon ture rakkoon sun garmalee salphaa ta'uu isaa ture.
We are the time.	Nuti yeroo sana.
Everyone wants some.	Namni hundi tokko tokko barbaada.
He just has to believe	Amanuu qofa qaba
I think that’s where he started drinking	Achitti dhugaatii jalqabe natti fakkaata
I mean, it’s a lot worse than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay’ee hamaa ta’e jechuu kooti.
It’s still so new.	Ammallee akkas haaraa dha.
But it’s not just those things.	Garuu wantoota sana qofa miti.
Then someone else.	Sana booda nama biraa.
I still have that problem	Ammallee rakkoon sun qaba
It wasn't what he saw, it was what he didn't see.	Waan inni arge osoo hin taane waan inni hin argine ture.
She was dangerous before.	Kanaan dura balaa qabdu turte.
He knew exactly what was coming	Waan dhufu sirriitti beeka ture
I told him that.	Akkas jedheen itti hime.
I wouldn't say it does much here though.	Asitti garuu waan baay'ee hojjeta hin jedhu.
Must.	Dirqama.
I have no idea how it works	Akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu
It doesn’t work.	Hojii hin hojjetu.
He’s right, of course.	Inni sirrii dha, beekamaadha.
This is the reality.	Dhugaa jiru kana.
It doesn't usually work that way.	Yeroo baayyee akkasitti hin hojjetu.
I like it very much	Baayyee natti tola
None of those things happened.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin taane.
One of the best of them.	Isaan keessaa isa gaarii tokko.
Everyone obviously has something to say.	Namni hundi waan jedhu akka qabu ifaadha.
That would be different.	Sun adda taʼa.
This was their job.	Kun hojii isaanii ture.
I really hadn’t noticed that much at the time	Dhuguma yeroo sanatti hangas hin hubanne ture
But he didn’t have it.	Garuu hin qabu ture.
Just playing around.	Taphachuu qofa.
After a while, however	Xiqqoo booda garuu
It worked out well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete.
Everything was on the up and up.	Wanti hundi ol fi ol irratti ture.
But someone did.	Garuu namni tokko akkas godhe.
I wondered what they were doing.	Maal gochaa jiru jedheen yaade.
All of this is possible.	Kun hundi ni danda’ama.
I knew nothing after that	Sana booda homaa hin beeku ture
I didn’t know any of them	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin beeku ture
I think she would be like that	Isheen akkas ta'a jedheen yaada
We all have the same opportunity.	Hundi keenya carraa tokko qabna.
But there is no such possibility.	Garuu carraan akkasii hin jiru.
That’s how they work.	Akkasitti hojjetu.
I was just glad I still had a job	Ammallee hojii qabaachuu kootti qofa gammade
He seems to be doing well now.	Amma waan gaarii hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
He was a potential gentleman .	Inni nama gaarii ta'uu danda'u ture .
I might as well not exist	Anis jiraachuu dhiisuu danda'a ture
I haven’t told him anything yet	Hanga ammaatti homaa itti hin himne
I didn't know what it was	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I never wanted to stay here	Ani tasumaa as turuu hin barbaanne
No one stayed very long.	Namni baayyee dheeraa ture hin jiru.
It couldn't be here.	As ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I couldn't talk about anything else.	Waa'ee waan biraa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
Now, things are different.	Amma, wanti jiru adda adda.
He spoke to me about it this morning.	Har'a ganama waa'ee kanaa natti dubbateera.
I mean, watch what happens	Waan ta'u ilaalaa jechuu kooti
Now, not that much.	Amma, hamma sana miti.
If she wasn’t there he had a problem.	Yoo isheen achi hin jirre rakkoo qaba ture.
I don’t mean those things	Wantoota sana jechuu koo miti
He didn’t have anything	Waan tokkollee hin qabu ture
I couldn't believe it was him	Isa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
This was a father and daughter.	Kun abbaa fi intala ture.
I never know what to do	Maal akka godhu gonkumaa hin beeku
We saw a little of him.	Isa xiqqoo argine.
I didn't even really know why	Maaliif akka ta'e illee dhuguma hin beeku ture
I have a feeling everyone is very excited.	Miira namni hundi baayyee itti gammade qaba.
I still don't understand much.	Ammallee baay'ee hin hubanne.
I really wanted to know	Ani baay'een beekuu barbaade
That's how it worked.	Akkasitti hojjete.
Now I have a great idea	Amma yaada guddaa qaba
He didn’t have any money	Maallaqa tokkollee hin qabu ture
It's just too bad.	Baay'ee hamaa qofa.
In this case, one of two things must happen.	Haala kana keessatti waan lama keessaa tokko ta’uu qaba.
I didn’t think you were interested	Fedhii qabdu natti hin fakkaatu ture
I know he knows me	Akka inni na beeku nan beeka
That doesn’t mean that.	Kana jechuu miti.
I wasn't sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Sometimes that happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas ta'a.
He is still not in this house	Ammas mana kana keessa hin jiru
I need you so much	Baay'ee si barbaada
I have one question though	Gaaffii tokko qaba garuu
I didn’t want him at all	Ani tasumaa isa hin barbaanne
I didn't understand what had happened.	Waan taʼe naaf hin galle.
I won't tell him anything	Ani homaa itti hin himu
I thought it looked good together	Waliin gaarii fakkaata jedheen yaade
I had so many questions	Gaaffii baay'een qaba ture
I have no idea what to do	Waan godhu yaada hin qabu
I want to know your thoughts	Yaada keessan beekuu barbaada
Not sure about that.	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I can't find her date	Guyyaa ishee argachuu hin danda'u
The real evil.	Hamaa dhugaa.
Three big ones.	Sadii guddaa.
I hadn’t seen this coming	Kun dhufuu isaa hin argine ture
I mean, I have a lot of boys.	Dhimma isaa qaba jechuu kooti, ​​gurbaa baay'een qaba.
I used to have a lot of this	Duraan kana baay'een qaba ture
It was really a problem.	Dhuguma rakkoo ture.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I need that now.	Amma sana na barbaachisa.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I just never saw him	Ani garuu tasumaa isa hin argine qofa
I think it's bad.	Hamaa natti fakkaata.
I thought about him a lot at night	Halkan baay'een waa'ee isaa yaada ture
With their friends.	Hiriyyoota isaanii waliin.
They are still working.	Ammas hojjechaa jiru.
He's doing fine now.	Amma gaarii hojjechaa jira.
Just great, great stuff!.	Waan guddaa, guddaa qofa!.
I love you just for that reason	Sababa kanaaf qofa si jaalladha
It’s important.	Barbaachisaa dha.
Now I have to go, you know work	Amma deemuun qaba, hojjechuu beekta
You have to have two.	Lamaan qabaachuu qabda.
This is who she is now.	Amma eenyu akka taate kana.
Then it was easy.	Sana booda salphaa ture.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
In an accident.	Balaa keessatti.
There is still hope.	Ammallee abdiin jira.
Real work	Hojii dhugaa
He wondered what it was about them	Waa'ee isaanii maal akka ta'e yaade
He was never good at this	Kana irratti gonkumaa gaarii hin turre
I can't say much more than that. 	Kana caalaa baay'ee dubbachuu hin danda'u. 
She was fine.	Isheen gaarii turte.
I know your name	Maqaa kee beeka
I mean, really just go.	Dhuguma deemuu qofa jechuu kooti.
I knew why he did it	Maaliif akkas akka godhe nan beeka ture
I couldn’t say why, exactly.	Maaliif jechuu hin dandeenye, sirriitti.
Tonight, we had a little bit of both.	Halkan kana, xiqqoo lamaan isaanii qabna turre.
A lot happened that year.	Bara sanatti waan baay'een ta'e.
I didn’t tell my people	Ani namoota kootti hin himne
They’re just ideas.	Isaan yaada qofa.
I didn't do it today	Har'a hin goone
Throughout that area.	Naannoo sana hunda keessatti.
Her voice, not his.	Sagalee ishee malee kan isaa miti.
I could have gone there	Silaa achi deemuu nan danda'a ture
I was human and something else	Ani nama fi waan biraa ture
He wouldn't say it.	Hin jedhu ture.
This is important.	Kun barbaachisaa dha.
I still don’t understand your point.	Ammallee yaada keessan hin hubanne.
This past week, this doesn’t seem to have worked.	Torban darbe kana, kun waan hojjete hin fakkaatu.
It was a job.	Hojii ture.
They were wrong.	Dogoggora turan.
It’s me.	Ana dha.
I didn’t know you had one	Tokko akka qabdu hin beeku ture
Obviously it was a mistake.	Dogoggora akka ture ifaadha.
He was on his own right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana kan isaa irra ture.
It is not an easy duty like that.	Dirqama akka sanaa salphaa miti.
He is in school.	Mana barumsaa jira.
I just wasn’t into it	Ani garuu keessa hin turre qofa
It was more of the same.	Caalaatti kanuma ture.
I have something else to do for you	Waan biraa siif gootu qaba
It shouldn’t matter.	Dhimma qabaachuu hin qabu.
I interviewed her this afternoon	Har'a waaree booda gaaffii fi deebii ishee waliin godhe
I have a lot of other things.	Waan biraa baay'een qaba.
I can't make money.	Maallaqa argachuu hin danda'u.
I didn’t want to see him like that.	Akkasitti isa arguu hin barbaanne.
I know what's going on here	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru nan beeka
I know you don't want to go back	Deebi'uu akka hin barbaanne nan beeka
I didn't speak.	Ani hin dubbanne.
I really like it.	Dhuguma natti tola.
We’re looking great.	Guddaa fakkaataa jirra.
Sometimes it’s not an easy task.	Yeroo tokko tokko hojii salphaa miti.
He was a good one.	Inni gaarii ture.
We wanted to do something similar to that	Waan sana fakkaatu hojjechuu barbaanne
I could never be like you	Ani gonkumaa akka kee ta'uu hin danda'u ture
But that only happens rarely, very rarely, you know.	Garuu sun yeroo muraasa qofa, baayyee yeroo muraasa qofa ta'a, beekta.
I really think so	Dhuguma akkas jedheen yaada
I would love nothing more	Kana caalaa homaa hin jaalladhu ture
He says you should go for it	Isaaf deemuu qabdu jedha
I really thought that was the one	Ani dhuguma isa sana natti fakkaate
I wasn’t myself.	Ani ofii koo hin turre.
I can't have that happening in my house	Mana koo keessatti akkas ta'aa jiru qabaachuu hin danda'u
I really shouldn’t say this.	Dhuguma kana jechuu hin qabu.
But it is not necessary.	Garuu dirqama miti.
But, that’s not all.	Garuu, kana qofa miti.
I love this book so much.	Kitaaba kana baay'een jaalladha.
I didn’t tell him that, of course	Ani kana itti hin himne, beekamaadha
I am not that person	Ani nama sana miti
I couldn’t react to anything	Homaa irratti deebii kennuu hin dandeenye
She doesn't want you.	Isheen si hin barbaaddu.
He still has a lot to do, apparently.	Ammallee waan baay'ee hojjechuu qaba, fakkaata.
One I hadn't seen very often at all	Tokko yeroo baay'ee tasumaa hin argine ture
Everything was like that.	Wanti hundi akkas ture.
He didn't want that.	Kana hin barbaanne ture.
I had no idea what to do	Maal akkan godhu homaa hin qabu ture
I don’t have a feeling.	Miira hin qabu.
I had to be wrong	Ani dogoggora ta'uu qaba ture
He knew that voice well.	Sagalee sana sirriitti beeka ture.
They are not his children.	Isaan ijoollee isaa miti.
I really wanted to go with them	Isaan waliin deemuu baay'een barbaade
It wants to be something.	Waan tokko ta'uu barbaada.
She didn't know what to think of him.	Maal akka isa yaaddu hin beekne.
But that’s nothing new.	Garuu sun waan haaraa miti.
Sometimes they seem so, but they are not.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas fakkaatu, garuu akkas miti.
I think this was the answer.	Deebii kana ture jedheen yaada.
But she didn't.	Isheen garuu hin goone.
I looked at what they were doing	Maal gochaa jiru jedheen ilaale
I know no one else knows about this	Waa'ee kanaa namni biraa akka hin beekne nan beeka
They loved each other very much.	Baay'ee wal jaallatu turan.
Now you have no problems.	Amma rakkoo hin qabdu.
I know what works for me.	Waan naaf ta'u nan beeka.
I only did that once.	Ani yeroo tokko qofa akkas godhe.
It never happened again.	Kana booda ta'ee hin beeku.
I have nothing wrong with them.	Isaan waliin waan hamaa hin qabu.
I couldn't be myself.	Of ta'uu hin dandeenye.
He had no children	Ijoollee hin qabu ture
I think you are who you are	Ati eenyu akka taate natti fakkaata
But there was obviously someone in the house.	Garuu mana keessa namni tokko akka ture ifaadha.
No one would do that.	Namni akkas hin godhu ture.
I couldn’t even answer him	Deebii isaaf kennuu illee hin dandeenye
It was just home but very nice	Mana qofa ture garuu baayyee namatti tola ture
I think that will take three of us	Sun sadii keenya ni barbaachisa jedheen yaada
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
Now I know what I want.	Amma maal akkan barbaadu nan beeka.
I can't go back now	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
I love you so much	Baay'een si jaalladha
That’s how I had to do it	Akkasitti gochuun qaba ture
He no longer had anyone	Kana booda nama hin qabu ture
I know it will be soon	Yeroo dhiyootti akka ta'u nan beeka
I wish it wasn't	Osoo hin taane ta'ee natti tola
I won’t come without her.	Ishee malee hin dhufu.
I want to believe in Him	Isa amanuu barbaada
I don't understand anything	Homaa naaf hin galle
I think she did something to his car	Konkolaataa isaa irratti waan tokko goote natti fakkaata
I have a husband.	Abbaa manaa qaba.
I can do something for you	Waan tokko siif gochuu nan danda'a
He just did you a favor	Tola qofa siif godhe
I wouldn't be like them	Silaa akka isaanii hin ta'u ture
He is the one who	Inni waan .
It’s just me in my father’s.	Kan abbaa koo keessatti ana qofa.
I was really very happy	Dhuguma baay'een gammade
He shouldn’t have known.	Inni beekuu hin qabu ture.
It took a little while.	Yeroo xiqqoo itti fudhate.
But at the time.	Garuu yeroo sanatti.
I didn’t think about it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf itti hin yaadne.
That there was no real work there.	Akka achitti hojiin dhugaa akka hin turre.
I want to get to know him better	Caalaatti isa beekuu barbaada
It's not happening.	Ta'aa hin jiru.
I know you know this	Kana akka beektu nan beeka
At the time I didn’t know	Yeroo sanatti ani hin beeku ture
You are a good risk.	Ati balaa gaarii.
I often wondered why she had me	Yeroo baayʼee maaliif akka na qabdi jedheen yaada ture
That one took me a while.	Inni sun yeroo natti fudhate.
But not much help.	Garuu gargaarsa guddaa miti.
We have things to do.	Wantoota hojjechuu qabnu qabna.
It was a nice night.	Halkan sun namatti tola ture.
I wondered what was going on	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen yaade
He had time for me.	Yeroo naaf qaba ture.
He saw everything.	Waan hundumaa arge.
She has a favorite.	Kan isheen jaallattu qabdi.
I didn’t mean anything.	Homaa jechuu koo hin turre.
He knew exactly what that felt like	Sun maal akka fakkaatu sirriitti beeka ture
We can’t find her.	Ishee argachuu hin dandeenyu.
But we didn’t care.	Garuu dhimma hin qabnu turre.
I could leave it in the car	Konkolaataa keessa dhiisuu nan danda'a ture
They certainly have a dog.	Saree akka qaban beekamaadha.
I couldn't leave you	Si dhiisuu hin dandeenye
A week ago, she didn’t know where he was	Torban tokko dura eessa akka jiru hin beektu turte
I think you have a problem.	Rakkoo qabdu natti fakkaata.
But beyond that she was fine.	Garuu sanaa ol isheen gaarii turte.
I never have been, not really	Ani ta'ee hin beeku, dhuguma miti
But, it wouldn't happen.	Garuu, hin ta'u ture.
I am here to work for you	Siif hojjechuuf as jira
It will never go to anyone else	Yoomiyyuu gara nama biraa hin deemu
I still don’t do that	Ammas akkas hin godhu
I could have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu nan danda'a ture
I hadn’t thought of them	Isaan hin yaadne ture
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
Then it was up, up, up.	Sana booda ol, ol, ol ture.
He may never know.	Inni gonkumaa beekuu dhiisuu danda'a.
I really didn’t know what to do	Dhuguma maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
It happened often.	Yeroo baay'ee ni ta'a ture.
I could help you	Si gargaaruu nan danda'a ture
It was really happening.	Dhuguma ta'aa ture.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I wasn’t expecting anything	Homaa eegaa hin turre
I just didn’t want to say anything	Ani homaa jechuu qofa hin barbaanne
Everybody.	Nama hunda.
Nothing like that happened.	Wanti akkasii hin taane.
But no one knows about it.	Garuu namni waa'ee isaa beeku hin jiru.
I would have done that.	Silaa akkas nan godha ture.
He didn’t do any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin goone.
He must know exactly where he is	Bakka inni jiru sirriitti beekuu qaba
But it doesn't seem to work.	Garuu waan hin hojjenne fakkaata.
I couldn’t find anything.	Homaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I should have told you	Silaa sitti himuu qaba ture
They are not wrong.	Dogoggora hin qaban.
You will love this one.	Isa kana ni jaallattu.
No one could see me.	Namni na arguu hin dandeenye.
We need to do this together.	Kana waliin gochuu qabna.
This was completely different.	Kun guutummaatti adda ture.
Maybe he'll do his job now.	Tarii amma hojii isaa ni hojjeta ta'a.
About what you can be.	Waa'ee waan ta'uu dandeessu.
I know this is not easy for you	Kun siif salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
He wanted to meet them as soon as possible	Dafee isaan waliin wal arguu barbaade
I had no idea there was so much involved	Waan baay'een akka keessa jiru yaada hin qabu ture
I can do this with you all day	Guyyaa guutuu kana si waliin gochuu nan danda'a
I have to say something	Waan tokko jechuu qaba
I thought he loved you	Si jaallatu natti fakkaate
I could have lived in one of them	Silaa isaan keessaa tokko keessa jiraachuu nan danda'a ture
But the odds were too great.	Garuu carraan jiru garmalee guddaa ture.
They are not themselves.	Isaan ofii isaanii miti.
It was the night before the accident.	Halkan balaa sana dura ture.
Weeks are not months.	Torban ji'a miti.
They are doing very well at home.	Mana keessatti baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
Then it became clear.	Sana booda ifa ta'e.
It's not always going to be like that.	Yeroo hunda akkas ta'uuf hin deemu.
It would be great if we did that.	Osoo akkas goone baayyee gaarii ta'a.
He was clear.	Inni ifa ture.
That’s not my problem.	Sun rakkoo koo miti.
I'll never know if that's the case	Akkas ta'uu isaa yoomiyyuu hin beeku
Then again, sometimes it’s better.	Sana booda ammas yeroo tokko tokko ni wayya.
Why would they do that? 	Maaliif akkas godhu turan?
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I knew that was not the case	Akkas akka hin taane nan beeka ture
They often do.	Yeroo baayʼee ni godhu.
She couldn’t believe it after all her work	Hojii ishee hunda booda amanuu hin dandeenye
Like they do in my room.	Akka waan kutaa koo keessatti godhu.
It was working well at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akka gaariitti hojjechaa ture.
I'm sure there were some problems	Rakkoon tokko tokko akka ture mirkanaa'adha
Now it’s different.	Amma adda.
I really think we will be together again in no time	Dhuguma yeroo muraasa booda ammas waliin ta'a jedheen yaada
It seems to be going well.	Akka gaariitti waan deemaa jiru fakkaata.
I am everything to you	Ani waan hundumaa siif ta'a
In circumstances, no more.	Haala keessatti, kana caalaa hin ta’u.
He didn't make it true.	Dhugaa hin goone.
I think they really like me	Dhuguma na jaallatu natti fakkaata
He was right, of course.	Inni sirrii akka ture beekamaadha.
His work was no better.	Hojiin isaa kana caalaa hin turre.
Later I saw him in his room	Booda kutaa isaa keessatti isa arge
He looks like himself.	Ofii isaa fakkaata.
I'm still watching.	Ammas ilaalaa jira.
There was no one there.	Namni achi hin turre.
It went a lot.	Baay'ee deeme.
Nobody wants that.	Namni akkas barbaadu hin jiru.
I had to go further	Kana caalaa deemuun qaba ture
I didn't know there was so much going on	Waan baay'ee akka jiru hin beeku ture
What a dog.	Maal saree.
Nothing else is clear.	Wanti biraa ifa ta'e hin jiru.
But that’s the problem.	Garuu rakkoon jiru kanuma.
I wasn't trying, but it happened	Ani yaalaa hin turre, garuu ta'e
It has a problem.	Rakkoo qaba.
He obviously did.	Inni akka godhe ifaadha.
It’s never just the two of them.	Isaan lamaan qofa ta’ee hin beeku.
That’s all one thing.	Sun hundi waan tokko.
I definitely don’t want to live like that	Akkas jiraachuu akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha
I belonged here with them	Ani isaan waliin kan as ture
We’re all fine.	Hundi keenya gaarii jirra.
At the same time.	Kanuma waliin.
You may not need a lot of clothes.	Uffata baayʼee si hin barbaachisu taʼa.
I didn’t think it was me	Ana natti hin fakkaatu ture
I would go with Dad	Abbaa wajjin nan deema ture
But I knew better than that	Ani garuu kana caalaa beeka ture
Maybe you can help each other.	Tarii wal gargaaruu dandeessu.
Glad to have him here	Asitti isa argachuu kootti gammadeera
But it could be something completely different.	Garuu guutummaatti waan adda ta’e ta’uu danda’a.
I have no idea who or what that entails	Sun eenyu fi maal akka of keessaa qabu yaada hin qabu
I don't want to think.	Yaadu hin barbaadu.
Not often but sometimes.	Yeroo baayyee osoo hin taane yeroo tokko tokko.
His job was simple.	Hojiin isaa salphaa ture.
There is no time.	Yeroon hin jiru.
You were older than me.	Ati na caalaa nama guddaa turte.
I didn’t meet them.	Isaan waliin wal hin argine.
it must have a.	qabaachuu qaba.
This seems unreasonable.	Kun waan sababa hin qabne fakkaata.
We need to be clear on this.	Kana irratti ifa ta'uu qabna.
He needed to do this if he was going to do it.	Kana gochuuf yoo taʼe gochuun isa barbaachisa ture.
I have my friends.	Hiriyyoota koo qaba.
I will know tomorrow morning	Boru ganama nan beeka
But one year was enough.	Waggaa tokko garuu gahaa ture.
I have no interest	Fedhii hin qabu
I know what’s at stake	Waan balaa irra jiru nan beeka
This is nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa miti.
It was a house.	Mana ture.
He wouldn't go now	Amma hin deemu ture
I needed alone time	Yeroo kophaa isaa na barbaachisa ture
This was never an issue.	Kun gonkumaa dhimma hin turre.
I had known her for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee beeka ture
I thought as much.	Anis hamma sana jedheen yaade.
That’s nothing new to us.	Sun nuuf waan haaraa miti.
I think he was right	Inni sirrii ture natti fakkaata
I can see them.	Isaan arguu danda'a.
I knew the truth.	Dhugaa jiru nan beeka ture.
I think this was true	Kun dhugaa ture jedheen yaada
I will do whatever it takes	Waan barbaachisu hunda nan godha
I think that was inevitable	Sun waan hin oolle ture jedheen yaada
I was none of those things	Ani wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin turre
It was everywhere.	Bakka hunda ture.
It has a lot of buttons	Qabduu baay'ee qaba
He is right in one.	Tokko keessatti sirrii dha.
He’s the only one.	Inni qofa.
That looked bad.	Sun hamaa fakkaata ture.
I don't think about it anymore	Kana booda hin yaadu
I know she was trying to get me to come	Akkan akkan dhufu gochuuf yaalaa akka turte nan beeka
He could have said that.	Silaa akkas jechuu danda'a ture.
I saw her leave a little while ago	Yeroo xiqqoo dura akka deemtu arge
I hadn’t noticed him yet	Hanga ammaatti isa hin hubanne ture
He wouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas hin godhu ture.
I can't do any more	Kana caalaa gochuu hin danda'u
I want to come with you	Si waliin dhufuu barbaada
I can't go any further.	Kana caalaa deemuu hin danda'u.
I made it work.	Akka hojjetu nan godhe.
I could have had someone else in that school	Mana barumsaa sana keessatti nama biraa qabaachuu nan danda'a ture
And I thought that was you	Anis sun si natti fakkaate
You are not important.	Ati barbaachisaa miti.
That has never happened before.	Kana dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
He told us that no one came to his door.	Namni balbala isaatti dhufe akka hin jirre nutti hime.
Maybe you are right.	Tarii ati sirrii dha ta'a.
Everyone had to have two.	Namni hundi lama qabaachuu qaba ture.
Right in there.	Sirriitti achi keessa.
It needs you to make it do something	Waan tokko akka gootu akka gootu si barbaachisa
I want you to think	Akka ati yaaddu nan barbaada
I want to say something	Waan tokko jechuu barbaada
I didn’t want this for you	Kana siif hin barbaanne
I had no idea what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
But that eye.	Garuu ija sana.
I really couldn't tell you why	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e sitti himuu hin dandeenye
It was all different.	Hundi isaa adda ture.
I love you so much	Baay'een si jaalladha
I was the real thing	Ani waan dhugaa ture
That's what we did.	Akkas goone.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Hin danda'u, hin danda'u, hin danda'u.
She and she .	Ishee fi isheen .
The most important part.	Kutaa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
But there was no one.	Garuu namni hin turre.
He wanted to help a little	Xiqqoo gargaaruu barbaade
Not even a name.	Maqaa illee miti.
I am no exception	Anis kanaan ala miti
But that is not the case here.	Garuu asitti akkas miti.
We’re doing really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jirra.
But it’s my daughter.	Garuu intala kooti.
That shouldn't be necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa ta'uu hin qabu.
I can be whoever you want me to be	Ani eenyu akkan ta'u barbaaddu ta'uu nan danda'a
I just have a couple of questions	Gaaffii tokko lama qofa qaba
Live.	Jiraachuu.
You are not real.	Ati dhugaa miti.
For the most part they didn’t quite look like her reality.	Irra caalaa isaan guutummaatti dhugaa ishee hin fakkaatu turan.
I didn’t know what to think of what he said.	Waan inni jedhe irratti maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture.
I can't tell you.	Sitti himuu hin danda'u.
I have nothing wrong with them.	Isaan waliin waan hamaa hin qabu.
I wondered how I was going to work it out of myself	Akkamitti of keessaa hojjechuuf deema jedheen yaade
I knew what he was going to do	Waan inni gochuuf deemu nan beeka ture
I wouldn’t want to do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin barbaadu ture.
He’s nice to stay here.	Inni as turuuf namatti tola.
He knows better than we do.	Inni nu caalaa beeka.
More than a day.	Guyyaa caalaa.
For me, for you.	Ana siif.
I hoped he understood	Akka hubate abdiin qaba ture
I have a problem.	Rakkoon qaba.
I could almost see her	Ishee arguu danda'a jechuun ni danda'ama
Now we’re going to do it again.	Amma ammas hojjechuuf jirra.
He had no truth.	Dhugaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I couldn't believe what happened a month ago	Waan ji'a tokko dura ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
It will never come.	Gonkumaa hin dhufu.
We are in it.	Keessa jirra.
I can see all about us	Waa'ee keenya hunda arguu nan danda'a
He didn’t just say that.	Akkas qofa hin dubbanne.
It just didn't happen.	Akka hin taane qofa ta'e.
And I really mean that	Anis dhuguma akkas jechuu kooti
This will be necessary later.	Kun booda barbaachisaa ta’a.
They work very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjetu.
This was not going to happen, it was that clear.	Kun ta'uuf hin turre, hangas ifa ture.
He was with me.	Inni na waliin ture.
It was a bit much.	Xiqqoo baay'ee ture.
I knew this wasn’t going to be easy	Kun salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
There will be tomorrow.	Boru ni jiraata.
I need some sleep, that’s all	Hirriba xiqqoo na barbaachisa, kana qofa
I couldn’t do that to him.	Ani akkas isa gochuu hin dandeenye.
More than a problem.	Rakkoo caalaa.
Maybe he's the father.	Tarii inni abbaa ta'uu danda'a.
I knew nothing about them.	Isaan homaa hin beeku ture.
I will probably do that tomorrow	Boru akkas gochuun koo hin oolu
I still don't know how	Akkamitti akka ta'e hanga ammaatti hin beeku
This was extreme.	Kun garmalee ture.
More of that later.	Sana caalaa booda.
He must have her.	Ishee qabaachuu qaba.
There is absolutely no reason for this to happen.	Kun ta’uuf sababni gonkumaa hin jiru.
He started walking again.	Ammas deemuu jalqabe.
I didn’t see him there, either.	Anis achitti isa hin argine,
I want to get to know him better	Caalaatti isa beekuu barbaada
It had the same name as you.	Kan maqaa kee wajjin wal fakkaatu qaba ture.
I think that was a good idea	Sun yaada gaarii ture jedheen yaada
And yet it is here.	Ammas ta'ee as jira.
More in her mouth.	Caalaatti afaan ishee keessa.
I didn’t want to stay home.	Mana turuu hin barbaanne.
There were no people.	Namoonni hin turre.
That wasn’t human.	Sun nama hin turre.
Her own daughter.	Intala ofii ishee.
Not enough money.	Maallaqa gahaa miti.
Just now it was the worst.	Amma qofa isa hamaa ture.
I know you are mine	Ati kan koo ta'uu kee nan beeka
It looked very small.	Baayyee xiqqoo fakkaata ture.
He was a teacher.	Barsiisaa ture.
Maybe it's just me.	Tarii ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I'm looking for a place	Bakka barbaadaa jira
I wish it had happened earlier	Osoo kanaan dura ta'ee natti tola
Someone who thinks he loves me	Nama na jaallatu jedhee yaadu
He looked at himself quickly	Dafee of ilaale
I didn’t see you here	Asitti si hin argine
Just a small matter.	Dhimma xiqqoo qofa.
I think that says a couple of things.	Sun waan tokko lama dubbata jedheen yaada.
I want to know what happened last year	Bara darbe maaltu akka ta'e beekuu barbaada
I knew why, that many did	Maaliif akka ta'e nan beeka ture, baay'een akka ta'e
We are with her.	Ishee waliin jirra.
I wonder who lives in there now	Amma eenyutu achi keessa jiraata jedheen yaada
I know you’re still going to him.	Ammallee gara isaa akka deemtu nan beeka.
Maybe an adult walking a dog.	Tarii nama guddaa tokko saree deemaa jiru ta'a.
But he didn't think about it.	Garuu hin yaadne.
Looks like I came into some money	Maallaqa tokko tokko keessa waanan dhufe fakkaata
It will never come my way.	Yoomiyyuu karaa kootti hin dhufu.
I think I have an idea there	Achitti yaada qaba jedheen yaada
That's the house.	Sun mana dha.
You are one of them	Ati isaan keessaa tokko
I love you as surely as you love me	Akkuma ati na jaallattu mirkanaa'aa si jaalladha
We only went to one school.	Mana barumsaa tokko qofa deemne.
It could be the clock.	Sa'aatii ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t want anyone to know what was going on in here	Waan as keessa jiru namni tokkollee akka beeku hin barbaanne
I won’t tell you what to do	Waan gootu sitti hin himu
I hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I think that could be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada.
I don’t want anyone else to be in that situation	Namni biraa haala sana keessa akka jiru hin barbaadu
He didn’t do the accident.	Balaa sana hin hojjenne.
He wants something positive.	Waan gaarii ta'e barbaada.
Few people have that opportunity.	Namoonni carraa sana qaban muraasa.
I looked down the street	Anis karaa irra ilaale
We have everything in there.	Waan hundumaa achi keessa qabna.
There was nothing maternal about her.	Waa'ee ishee wanti haadha ta'e hin turre.
I would have been better off that way	Akkasitti naaf wayya ture
Now he got it.	Amma argate.
That was my chance.	Carraan koo kanuma ture.
I wondered what would happen after me	Na booda maaltu ta'a jedheen yaade
I think we both have something in common	Lamaan keenyayyuu waan wal fakkaatu qabna jedheen yaada
He was always right.	Yeroo hundumaa sirrii ture.
I should never have done it	Silaa gonkumaa gochuu hin qabu ture
It wasn’t entirely true.	Guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre.
He had a dog a very long time ago	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa dura saree qaba ture
I was sure he was there just moments ago	Yeroo muraasa dura qofa akka achi jiru mirkanaa'aa ture
I didn’t want anything more	Kana caalaa waanan qabu hin barbaanne
I probably shouldn't say much	Baay'ee dubbachuu hin qabu ta'a
But now it’s now.	Amma garuu amma.
Every morning we	Ganama hunda ni .
It's just such an obvious thing.	Waan akkasii ifa ta'e qofa.
She was really a little girl.	Dhuguma intala xiqqoo turte.
Maybe you don't know how to do it.	Tarii akkamitti akka gootu hin beektu ta'a.
But there is nothing real in them.	Garuu wanti dhugaa isaan keessa jiru hin jiru.
It still looked pretty big.	Ammas baayyee guddaa fakkaata ture.
I really didn’t know what to do.	Dhuguma maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
But it’s not working.	Garuu hojjechaa hin jiru.
But this is not about me.	Garuu kun waa'ee koo miti.
All you have to do is ask.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu gaafachuu qofa.
I have, you know that	Ani qaba, ati kana beekta
But there is nothing more.	Garuu kana caalaa hin jiru.
Now it's mine.	Amma kan kooti.
This is not a human being.	Kun nama miti.
He was one of them.	Inni tokko ture.
This is, however, very unlikely.	Kun garuu baay’ee hin oolu.
I thought that was a great idea	Sun yaada guddaa natti fakkaate
He had a few things to do	Wantoota muraasa hojjechuu qaba ture
I could have told him everything	Silaa waan hundumaa itti himuu nan danda'a ture
Thus we currently do nothing.	Akkasitti yeroo ammaa homaa hin goonu.
He looks older.	Inni umuriin isaa guddaa fakkaata.
So it’s there.	Kanaaf achi jira.
This is the situation.	Kun haala.
He has a house here.	Asitti mana qaba.
He quickly bought two	Dafee lama bite
I was doing a lot of thinking.	Yaada baay'ee hojjechaa ture.
I looked outside.	Anis ala ilaale.
I didn’t know where he was.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku ture.
I have another commitment that day	Guyyaa sanatti waadaa biraa qaba
This whole thing just seems a bit much to me	Wanti kun hundi xiqqoo baay'ee natti fakkaata qofa
I knew what she wanted.	Waan isheen barbaaddu nan beeka ture.
I couldn’t live with my parents for long	Warra koo wajjin yeroo dheeraa jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I can't really do much with him	Dhuguma isa waliin ta'ee waan baay'ee hojjechuu hin danda'u
I didn’t want him	Ani isa hin barbaanne
It’s not a problem.	Rakkoo miti.
I couldn't believe what just happened	Waan amma ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
I was still here and alone	Ammallee as fi kophaa koo ture
Everything must be right.	Hundi sirrii ta'uu qaba.
Most people make mistakes, mom	Namoonni baay'een dogoggora hojjetu haadha
Those were some of my favorite moments of her.	Yeroon sun yeroo isheen arge baayʼee jaalladhu keessaa muraasa turan.
I didn’t really speak to anyone	Dhuguma nama tokkollee hin dubbanne
It’s not my business.	Dhimma koo miti.
I know your work, of course.	Hojii keessan nan beeka, beekamaadha.
I have no idea what happened to my life	Jireenya koo irratti maaltu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
I want to get to know you better	Caalaatti si beekuu barbaada
She should have left them.	Silaa isaan dhiisuu qabdi turte.
I wanted to tell him a lot	Waan baay'ee itti himuu barbaade
I think I have it right	Sirrii qaba jedheen yaada
I have no desire to be one	Tokko ta'uuf fedhii hin qabu
I couldn’t do anything like that.	Waan akkasii hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
I don’t know how it works, really	Akkamitti akka hojjetu hin beeku, dhuguma
When was this.	Kun yoom ture.
He wasn't sure what he wanted	Waan inni barbaadu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Only for a short time.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
Maybe just the two of you.	Tarii isin lamaan qofa.
One of them is date and time.	Isaan keessaa tokko guyyaa fi sa’aatii dha.
I wanted to meet him	Isa waliin wal arguu barbaade
I know when something is wrong	Yeroo wanti tokko dogoggora ta'e nan beeka
I don’t know how to do it	Akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku
Several times ago.	Yeroo hedduu dura.
I still do it.	Ammallee nan godha.
I know what was happening	Waan ta'aa ture nan beeka
He had a great voice.	Sagalee guddaa qaba ture.
There is no reason.	Sababni hin jiru.
I hoped no one noticed	Namni tokkollee akka hin hubanne abdiin qaba ture
But we don't have to.	Garuu dirqama ta'uu hin qabnu.
I didn't know what it was at the time	Yeroo sanatti maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
And I did pretty well	Anis baayʼee gaarii taʼe
You are not her.	Ati ishee miti.
You’ve known me for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf na beekta.
I just wanted to know about one thing	Waa'ee waan tokko qofa beekuu barbaade
You have to meet them.	Isaan waliin wal arguu qabda.
Might.	Tarii.
I couldn't have asked for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture.
It still may not happen.	Ammallee ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I couldn't believe it was true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
After this one.	Isa kana booda.
None of these scenarios would be true.	Haala kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa hin ta’u ture.
It doesn’t always seem that way	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin fakkaatu
I think he was real	Inni dhugaa ture natti fakkaata
You don’t even have to talk to me.	Natti dubbachuu illee hin qabdu.
Photos of his parents	Suuraa warra isaa
But of course this couldn’t happen.	Garuu beekamaadha kun ta’uu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t want him to go	Akka inni deemu hin barbaanne
I know how it all works	Hundi akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka
I was looking for something, but nothing like it	Waan tokko barbaadaa ture, garuu homaa akka isaa hin qabu
In reality this is not so.	Dhugaa jiru keessatti kun akkas miti.
She was one of those people.	Namoota sana keessaa tokko turte.
That day.	Guyyaa sana.
Now I know what is happening	Amma waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka
But that doesn't mean he can.	Garuu ni danda'a jechuu miti.
It looked like he needed help, not her.	Ishee osoo hin taane gargaarsa isa barbaadu fakkaata ture.
I mean, it can help	Gargaaruu danda'a jechuu kooti
It was a great little job.	Hojii xiqqoo guddaa ture.
I only know what you know.	Ani waan ati beektu qofa beeka.
Not just this morning.	Ganama kana qofa miti.
I can't say much more right now	Yeroo ammaa kana kana caalaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu hin danda'u
It's just a lot.	Baay'ee qofa.
This is not an easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa miti.
If the answer is yes.	Kan jedhu yoo ta'e.
So that could be it.	Kanaaf sun ta'uu danda'a.
One and the other.	Tokko fi kan biraa.
I didn't even have to do much work	Hojii baay'ee hojjechuu illee hin qabu ture
I say it now, but this can hardly be anything new.	Ani amma jedha, garuu kun waan haaraa ta'uu hin danda'u.
That it was all real.	Hundi isaa dhugaa akka ture.
I didn't know the place	Bakka sana hin beekne
She was just asking.	Isheen gaafachuu qofa turte.
He had something she didn’t.	Inni waan isheen hin qabne qaba ture.
That’s how they work.	Akkasitti hojjetu.
It was her only hope.	Abdii ishee qofa ture.
I have questions about the crash.	Waa'ee balaa konkolaataa kanaa gaaffii qaba.
I just need to ask him something	Waan tokko isa gaafachuu qofa na barbaachisa
He said you know.	Beekta jedhe.
You never know what someone else is going through.	Namni biraa maal keessa akka jiru gonkumaa hin beektu.
I am not doing well at all.	Ani tasumaa gaarii hin jiru.
So he went upstairs.	Kanaaf ol jedhee deeme.
They know her.	Ishee beeku.
I have a little to tell you	Xiqqoo sitti himu qaba
I don’t go to school	Ani mana barumsaa hin deemu
I have it from my mother	Haadha koo irraa qaba
I want to know what he’s doing in there	Waan inni achi keessa hojjetu beekuu barbaada
Maybe there's a chance.	Tarii carraan jiraachuu danda'a.
I had better do that now.	Amma akkas gochuun naaf wayya ture.
He may still have that chance.	Ammallee carraa sana qabaachuu danda'a.
It was simple, really.	Salphaa ture, dhuguma.
It can't be that bad.	Hamma kana hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I know all this well	Kana hunda sirriitti beeka
I think she said that	Akkas jette natti fakkaata
If so, you're in luck.	Yoo akkas ta'e carraa qabda.
That age was definitely a factor.	Umuriin sun waan tokko akka ture beekamaadha.
I want it all to be me	Hundi isaa akka ana ta'u nan barbaada
The best of his life.	Jireenya isaa keessaa isa gaarii.
There was no hope for it.	Abdiin itti hin turre.
I mean, you.	Si jechuu kooti.
You're still kidding me.	Ammas natti qoosaa jirta.
Do you already have one?.	Amma dura tokko qabduu?.
He wants us badly.	Inni hamaa nu barbaada.
I wondered who was watching me	Eenyutu na ilaalaa jira jedheen yaade
To be as she once was.	Akkuma yeroo tokko turte ta'uuf.
I didn't see it.	Hin argine.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
I couldn’t eat it.	Nyaachuu hin dandeenye.
This is the most important thing.	Kun waan hunda caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
He already knew there was a problem	Rakkoon akka jiru duruu beeka ture
I don’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I can just walk away	Ani qofa deemuu nan danda'a
He was really into that.	Dhuguma sana keessa ture.
I need to get to know this place better	Bakka kana caalaatti beekuu na barbaachisa
And it happened again.	Ammas ta'e.
I used to love going with them	Duraan isaan waliin deemuu nan jaalladha ture
It was a bad idea	Yaada hamaa ture
Who is ours.	Eenyu kan keenya.
I still want to do a few things with you	Ammallee waan muraasa si waliin hojjechuu barbaada
I mean, we didn’t do anything to it.	Homaa itti hin goone jechuu kooti.
You never would have been able to.	Silaa gonkumaa hin dandeessu turte.
That was really bad.	Sun dhuguma waan hamaa ture.
I was a big dog in that one	Ani isa sana keessatti saree guddaa ture
What! 	Maal!
How is it.	Akkamitti.
I'll be a good guy	Ani gurbaa gaarii ta'a
I didn’t want any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
I hadn’t realized it was inside at all	Keessa akka jiru tasumaa hin hubanne ture
I would like that.	Ani akkas nan barbaada.
Good stuff right there.	Waan gaarii sirriitti achitti.
I think he just doesn’t know you that well yet	Inni hanga ammaatti akkasitti si hin beeku qofa natti fakkaata
I love this time of the morning.	Yeroo ganama kana baay'een jaalladha.
I haven't told him about this job yet	Waa'ee hojii kanaa hanga ammaatti itti hin himne
I hope you don’t see it	Akka hin argine abdiin qaba
I have two answers.	Deebii lama qaba.
Then he came here.	Sana booda as dhufe.
I was with you the whole time	Yeroo guutuu si waliin ture
I couldn’t do this alone	Kana kophaa koo gochuu hin dandeenye
I didn't want to talk about the truth.	Waa'ee dhugaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
It was just too soon.	Dafee qofa ture.
He wasn't sure if that was the case	Inni akkas ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
But he didn't.	Garuu hin goone.
One might wonder what it means.	Namni tokko maal jechuu akka ta’e of gaafachuu danda’a.
He quickly looked back	Dafee duubatti ilaale
I couldn’t stay in my house last night	Halkan darbe mana koo keessa turuu hin dandeenye
I am not a bad person.	Ani nama hamaa miti.
I thought it was true.	Dhugaa natti fakkaate.
They know little about him	Waa'ee isaa waan xiqqoo beeku
My father's language.	Afaan abbaa koo.
It wasn’t true but it got its way.	Dhugaa hin turre garuu karaa isaa argate.
I think it would be easy.	Waan salphaa ta'a jedheen yaada.
He shouldn’t have been here.	As jiraachuu hin qabu ture.
I don't like it	Ani hin jaalladhu
That’s mostly what we have here.	Irra caalaa kan asitti qabnu kanuma.
I was glad that everything was fine	Wanti hundi gaarii taʼuu isaatti gammadeera
He knew where she was.	Bakka isheen jirtu beeka ture.
He should have done something	Silaa waan tokko gochuu qaba ture
Try this regularly.	Kana yeroo hunda yaalaa.
I love being in a room with people	Namoota waliin kutaa tokko keessa jiraachuu nan jaalladha
It was clear as day there.	Achitti akka guyyaa ifa ture.
I can be a husband and father	Ani abbaa manaa fi abbaa ta'uu nan danda'a
That’s your job.	Hojiin kee kanuma.
I know you weren’t.	Ati akka hin turre nan beeka.
It will be easier now.	Amma salphaa ta'a.
Drink the truth.	Dhugaa dhugaatii dhugaa.
You just have it.	Ati qofa qabda.
A sense that something is wrong	Miira wanti tokko dogoggora ta’uu isaa
We’re in everywhere.	Bakka hunda keessa jirra.
I want to tell you.	Sitti himuu barbaada.
I didn't even know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture.
She was the only one who did.	Kan godhe ishee qofa ture.
That he was the only one who understood.	Kan hubate isa qofa akka ta'e.
After something.	Waan tokko booda.
That’s not why.	Kanaaf miti.
I think this is what happened	Kan ta'e kana natti fakkaata
Walk.	Deemuu.
That’s just fine.	Sun gaarii qofa.
It is not a state of existence.	Haala jiraachuu miti.
But you can’t do anything about it.	Garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
Only this year.	Bara kana qofa.
You knew it was there.	Achi akka jiru beekta turte.
But, because.	Garuu, sababa.
Not exactly what you think.	Sirriitti waan ati yaaddu miti.
It works for very few.	Baayyee muraasaaf hojjeta.
You know this, but you don’t.	Kana beekta, garuu hin beektu.
I know many people	Namoota hedduu nan beeka
But no one else would work on anything	Garuu namni biraa homaa irratti hin hojjetu ture
Maybe there isn't.	Tarii hin jiru ta'a.
I don't have to do this	Ani kana gochuu hin qabu
He knew exactly what he was doing	Waan inni hojjetu sirriitti beeka ture
But I will do it.	Ani garuu nan godha.
I didn’t even think about that	Sana illee hin yaadne
I hope that is not the case	Akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba
That's not going to happen in this one.	Isa kana keessatti sun ta'uuf hin deemu.
Just simple things we have in common.	Wantoota salphaa nuti wal fakkaatu qofa.
I almost didn't want to come this afternoon	Har'a waaree booda dhufuu hin barbaanne jechuun ni danda'ama
But she was no longer there.	Isheen garuu kana booda hin turre.
They all work.	Hundi isaanii ni hojjetu.
She was not yet his wife.	Isheen ammallee haadha manaa isaa hin turre.
She was there all day.	Guyyaa guutuu achi turte.
A year later she was gone.	Waggaa tokko booda isheen hin jiru turte.
I wonder what you’re doing now	Amma maal hojjechaa jirta jedheen yaada
People make mistakes.	Namoonni dogoggora ni hojjetu.
I would never go a night without her again	Amma booda halkan tokkollee ishee malee hin deemu ture
I think it should be obvious.	Ifa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
That’s how it started.	Akkasitti jalqabe.
I wasn’t going to stay there for very long	Baayyee yeroo dheeraaf achi turuuf hin turre
I really need any of you	Isin keessaa tokkollee baay'ee na barbaachisa
This is entirely possible.	Kun guutummaatti ni danda’ama.
He didn’t always have it	Yeroo hundumaa hin qabu ture
But people were not outside.	Garuu namoonni ala hin turre.
I haven’t seen him in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf isa hin argine
That's what I said.	Akkas jedheen ture.
He has some work to do out there	Hojii tokko tokko achi keessaa hojjechuu qaba
This is not your money.	Kun qarshii keessan miti.
I can't help anyone right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana nama gargaaruu hin danda'u.
He knew the truth then	Dhugaa jiru yeroo sana beeka ture
That’s still not easy.	Sun ammallee salphaa miti.
It was working well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa ture.
Great room.	Kutaa guddaa.
Some people you just know.	Namoota tokko tokko ati qofa beektu.
You’re looking at the real thing.	Waan dhugaa ilaalaa jirta.
I know what happens in there	Waan achi keessa ta'u nan beeka
She was really on her way.	Dhuguma karaa irra turte.
I said I would have you.	Ani isa si qabaa jedheen ture.
Already.	Duraan.
A year ago it would not have happened	Waggaa tokko dura silaa hin ta'u ture
All should be fine.	Hundi gaarii ta'uu qaba.
I thought it looked bad	Hamaa fakkaata jedheen yaade
I can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Who would say such a thing.	Eenyutu waan akkasii jedha.
I wasn’t working	Ani hojjechaa hin turre
Nothing worked for me.	Wanti naaf hojjete hin jiru.
We had no idea what to do with them.	Maal akka isaan goonu yaada tokkollee hin qabnu turre.
I love everything	Waan hundumaa nan jaalladha
I know enough to do	Ani waanan hojjechuuf gahaa ta'e beeka
This is what makes your problem.	Rakkoo keessan kan gootu kana.
I thought about her all the time	Yeroo hundumaa waaʼee ishee nan yaada ture
Just noise and noise.	Sagalee fi sagalee qofa.
Luck looked into them in the eye.	Carraan ija keessa isaan keessa ilaale.
He knew what that was	Sun maal akka ta'e beeka ture
I couldn’t find him, he couldn’t find me.	Ani isa argachuu hin dandeenye, inni na argachuu hin dandeenye.
It’s not great.	Guddaa miti.
He would be my wife.	Inni haadha manaa koo ta'a ture.
Not now, not anymore.	Amma miti, kana booda miti.
A terrible sound.	Sagalee hamaa.
She didn't know for sure.	Isheen garuu mirkanaa'aa hin beektu turte.
I have no idea where it is	Eessa akka jiru yaada hin qabu
There is so much ahead of you.	Waan baay'ee si dura jira.
You are never around.	Ati gonkumaa naannoo kee hin jirtu.
But if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.	Yoo hin hojjenne garuu hin hojjetu.
No one needs to know.	Namni beekuu hin barbaachisu.
I don’t know you were in the room.	Kutaa keessa akka turte hin beeku.
He was really here.	Dhuguma as ture.
It’s not real life.	Jireenya dhugaa miti.
I hope no one else notices	Namni biraa akka hin hubanne abdiin qaba
That certainly wasn’t enough.	Sun gahaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
Three weeks ago.	Torban sadii dura.
I highly doubt that.	Sana baay'een shakka.
I want you here with me	Asitti na waliin si barbaada
That is not the case today.	Har'a akkas miti.
You're doing so well.	Akkasitti gaarii ta'aa jirta.
But I know this	Kana garuu nan beeka
No one else is going for us.	Namni biraa nuuf deemu hin jiru.
We'll have to talk about it later.	Booda waa'ee isaa dubbachuu qabna.
It works well this way.	Haala kanaan akka gaariitti hojjeta.
We have enough of us.	Nu gahaa qabna.
This was perfectly fine.	Kun guutummaatti gaarii ture.
I mean, just talking	Dubbachuu qofa jechuu kooti
Take a look at this.	Mee kana ilaalaa.
I just need time to do this	Kana hojjechuuf yeroo qofa na barbaachisa
But still.	Garuu ammas.
This was a good one.	Kun gaarii ture.
I mean, it looked like that	Akkas fakkaata ture jechuu kooti
To make you whole again.	Ammas guutuu si gochuuf.
He hadn't even been able to do that	Sana illee gochuu hin dandeenye ture
The problem is not new.	Rakkoon jiru haaraa miti.
I can always get a job in a bar again	Yeroo hundumaa ammas mana dhugaatii keessatti hojii argachuu nan danda'a
Not long but big.	Dheeraa osoo hin taane guddaa.
He knows her car.	Konkolaataa ishee ni beeka.
I didn't want to talk about it	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne
He is right'	Inni sirrii dha'.
I didn't know him all that well	Ani akkas hunda isa hin beeku ture
You have to know.	Beekuu qabda.
It’s not just one thing.	Waan tokko qofa miti.
I would have thought nothing of it	Silaa homaa itti hin yaadu ture
They have no idea what it looks like.	Maal akka fakkaatu yaada hin qaban.
I don't know anything.	Homaa hin beeku.
There didn’t seem to be time in that place.	Bakka sanatti yeroon waan jiru hin fakkaatu ture.
He wanted more than that.	Kana caalaa barbaade.
A week later.	Torban tokko booda.
But this time, nothing comes.	Yeroo kana garuu, wanti dhufu hin jiru.
I can see her.	Ishee arguu nan danda'a.
He could have let himself go.	Of dhiisuu danda'a ture.
I know the guy now	Gurbaa amma beeka
But it wasn’t a good night’s sleep.	Garuu hirriba gaarii hin turre.
Certainly not anytime soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
There must be some reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni tokko tokko jiraachuu qaba.
There should be none.	Tokkollee jiraachuu hin qabu.
You are with her.	Ati ishee waliin jirta.
Not like them.	Akka isaanii miti.
There is no one outside now.	Amma ala namni hin jiru.
Nothing else seemed more important.	Wanti biraa kana caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe hin fakkaatu ture.
That way I can see so much more.	Akkasitti waan baay'ee arguu nan danda'a.
I need you to do something for me	Waan tokko akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa
I didn’t understand it at the time	Yeroo sanatti naaf hin galle ture
I want to do this as much as she does	Anis hamma isheen gootu kana gochuu barbaada
They would have known him best.	Silaa hunda caalaa isa beeku turan.
I hesitated to be around her myself	Ofii koo naannoo ishee ta'uu irraa duubatti jedhe
I thought it was just one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko qofa natti fakkaate
I think he just needs time	Yeroo qofa isa barbaachisa jedheen yaada
But she had to do it.	Garuu isheen gochuu qabdi turte.
The problem would be the noise.	Rakkoon jiru sagalee ta'a.
The two of them were one.	Lamaan isaanii tokko turan.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee.
That was a rare moment.	Yeroon sun yeroo muraasa ture.
You don't know.	Hin beektu.
Maybe he's right.	Tarii sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
I still can't.	Ammallee hin danda'u.
I love you, but I have to go now	Si jaalladha, garuu amma deemuun dirqama
I couldn't have done it without all of you	Osoo hunda keessan hin taane gochuu hin danda'u ture
I couldn’t believe them	Isaan amanuu hin dandeenye
We hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdii qabna.
He gave him everything he had.	Waan qabu hunda isaaf kenne.
He looked at him quickly	Dafee isa ilaale
I don't know what it was about.	Waa'ee maal akka ture hin beeku.
I need money today.	Har'a qarshii na barbaachisa.
Little by little things.	Waan xiqqoo xiqqoo.
He has a wife.	Haadha manaa qaba.
I think that's probably just as wrong	Sun tarii akkuma kana dogoggora ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada
I could have been.	Silaa ta'uu nan danda'a ture.
I just didn't want to be alone all the time	Yeroo hunda kophaa koo ta'uu qofa hin barbaanne
Not once did that happen.	Yeroo tokkollee akkas hin taane.
I have to ask you that	Ani akkas jedhee si gaafachuu qaba
He was here several times	Yeroo hedduu as ture
I knew he loved my father	Abbaa koo akka jaallatu nan beeka ture
He knew what his job was.	Hojiin isaa maal akka taʼe beeka ture.
This is about right.	Kun waa'ee sirrii dha.
Tell me.	Natti himi.
But that’s what you have to do.	Garuu kanuma gochuu qabda.
I mean, they’re good together	Waliin gaarii dha jechuu kooti
But he should have known better.	Garuu kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
It’s been there for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf jira
This is certainly not an accident.	Kun balaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I doubt he cared much	Baay'ee dhimma itti ba'e jedheen shakka
He was a good guy.	Gurbaa gaarii ture.
I only saw him about twice.	Gara yeroo lama qofa isa arge.
She just doesn’t care anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabdu qofa.
But I want to believe him	Ani garuu isa amanuu barbaada
I mean, more than usual	Yeroo biraa caalaa jechuu kooti
I know you love her	Akka ishee jaallattu nan beeka
I had no idea at the time.	Yeroo sanatti yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I know he did it for me.	Akka naaf godhe nan beeka.
No one else can know.	Namni biraa beekuu hin danda'u.
I knew something was going to happen	Waan tokko ta'uuf akka jiru nan beeka ture
I couldn't see him.	Isa arguu hin dandeenye.
I had no idea what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
He certainly was.	Inni akka ture beekamaadha.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Ani homaa jechuu hin barbaanne.
She had to do it.	Isheen gochuu qabdi turte.
I want to talk about that	Waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu barbaada
It can't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
He never needed another name.	Maqaa biraa gonkumaa isa hin barbaachifne.
I want him to tell only what he knows	Waan beeku qofa akka inni himu barbaada
Maybe he had.	Tarii qaba ture ta'a.
He wants it later.	Booda barbaada.
Very important day.	Guyyaa baayyee barbaachisaa.
It wasn’t really anything new.	Dhuguma waan haaraa hin turre.
That there is nothing else.	Wanti biraa akka hin jirre.
He went on and on.	Irratti fi irra deeme.
Everything you need!.	Waan isin barbaachisu hunda!.
It was then that he saw the way.	Yeroo sana ture kan karaa arge.
I really didn’t belong there.	Dhuguma ani kan achi hin turre.
Then it was time to wait.	Sana booda yeroon eegaa ture.
I didn’t understand any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin hubanne
It’s really, really great.	Dhuguma, dhuguma guddaa dha.
I said it wasn't bad	Hamaa miti jedheen
I knew nothing about it	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture
It took a long time before he spoke.	Dubbachuu isaa dura yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
I can't tell anyone about it	Waa'ee kanaa namatti himuu hin danda'u
It almost doesn't matter anymore	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu jechuun ni danda'ama
But this was not the case.	Kun garuu akkas hin turre.
That’s not necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa miti.
I want to know more about it	Waa'ee isaa caalaatti beekuu barbaada
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu akkas miti.
That doesn’t mean anything though.	Sun garuu homaa jechuu miti.
He has a lot of work ahead of him.	Hojii guddaa of dura qaba.
I want you to do two things	Waan lama akka gootu nan barbaada
I didn’t understand why he would do that.	Maaliif akkas akka godhu naaf hin galle.
I want to be with you	Si waliin ta'uu nan barbaada
It's just our opinion.	Yaada keenya qofa.
I would have done this sooner	Silaa dafee kana nan godha ture
She was here today.	Har'a as turte.
I have no idea without them.	Isaan malee yaada tokkollee hin qabu.
It would be nice if we understood.	Yoo hubanne gaarii ta'a.
This is just wrong.	Kun dogoggora qofa.
Then it would be on its own.	Sana booda ofuma isaatiin ta'a ture.
We were really into that.	Dhuguma sana keessa turre.
You're in the house.	Mana keessa jirta.
I've had enough of that.	Sana gahaa ta'ee jira.
I am not alone in this	Kana keessa kophaa koo miti
It's just a situation of what happened afterwards.	Haala waan booda ta'e qofa.
But one must believe one thing.	Namni garuu waan tokko amanuu qaba.
I have a reason.	Ani sababa qaba.
He wanted to say something	Waan tokko dubbachuu barbaade
I still do this.	Ammallee kana nan godha.
He knew it perfectly.	Inni guutummaatti beeka ture.
I think she’s wrong	Isheen dogoggora natti fakkaata
Lots and lots of them.	Baay'ee fi baay'ee isaanii.
I know her very well.	Baay'ee ishee beeka.
I didn’t want to go without you	Si malee deemuu hin barbaanne
So this was it.	Kanaaf kun ture.
A dangerous place to be outside.	Bakka balaa qabu ala ta'uuf.
That's what she said.	Kana jette.
He shouldn't do that.	Akkas gochuu hin qabu.
It was no longer necessary	Kana booda barbaachisaa hin turre
I wanted nothing more than to get you from him	Isa irraa si argachuu malee homaa hin barbaanne
You know that way.	Karaa sana ni beektu.
I could have done without it	Silaa kana malee gochuu nan danda'a ture
It's just what happened.	Kan ta'e qofa.
I always do, you know	Yeroo hundumaa nan godha, beekta
That wasn’t good enough.	Sun gaarii hin turre.
I know everyone.	Nama hunda nan beeka.
He was doing him a good favour	Tola gaarii isaaf gochaa ture
Now it worked.	Amma hojjete.
It wasn’t like that before.	Duraan akkas hin turre.
I thought he wanted something	Waan barbaade jedheen yaade
They never even need to know it's you.	Isaan gonkumaa si ta'uu isaa beekuu illee hin barbaachisu.
Everything became new.	Wanti hundi haaraa ta'e.
It should not have happened.	Silaa taʼuu hin qabu ture.
I need your help.	Gargaarsa keessan barbaada.
No one told me.	Namni natti hin himne.
I want you to know some things about me	Waa'ee koo waan tokko tokko akka beektu nan barbaada
I didn’t want to tell you, but it’s there.	Sitti himuu hin barbaanne, garuu achi jira.
I know you want to see your mother	Haadha kee arguu akka barbaaddu nan beeka
I hope everything turns out fine	Wanti hundi gaarii akka ta'u abdiin qaba
He saw things he shouldn’t have seen.	Wantoota silaa arguu hin qabne arge.
That was her age.	Umuriin ishee kanuma ture.
I told someone about it	Anis waa'ee kanaa namatti hime
None of this is true.	Kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa miti.
See where he goes, what he does.	Eessa akka deemu, maal akka hojjetu ilaalaa.
Everything will be new.	Wanti hundi haaraa ta'a.
Then you don’t need to do this.	Sana booda kana gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
I always have time for you	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo siif qaba
You can’t tell us.	Nutti himuu hin dandeessu.
Everything is too obvious.	Wanti hundi garmalee ifaadha.
You have great hope.	Abdii guddaa qabda.
But he is wrong.	Garuu dogoggora qaba.
Being up here.	As ol ta'uu.
I didn’t want to go anywhere else	Bakka biraa deemuu hin barbaanne
I just can't say it's not mine.	Kan koo miti jechuu qofa hin danda'u.
I really don't know why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I knew your mother in those days	Haadha kee bara sana nan beeka ture
He always had it	Yeroo hundumaa qaba ture
I am not among them.	Ani isaan keessaa hin jiru.
That he does that.	Akka inni akkas godhu.
You have good people.	Namoota gaarii qabda.
I don't know her name.	Maqaa ishee hin beeku.
They work with me.	Ana waliin hojjetu.
It's not here.	Asitti hin jiru.
But this wasn’t good enough.	Garuu kun gaarii hin turre.
Is this really what you want?.	Dhuguma waan ati barbaaddu kana moo?.
I’ve known you for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf si beeka
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
What you have done is right.	Wanti ati goote sirrii dha.
There was none here.	Asitti tokkollee hin turre.
I knew you were here	Akka ati as jirtu nan beeka ture
But it wasn’t easy.	Garuu salphaa hin turre.
Again, it is not necessary.	Ammas dirqama miti.
Savage.	Hamaa.
But there are.	Garuu ni jiru.
He had very few opportunities	Carraan baay'ee muraasa qaba ture
he must tell them.	itti himuu qaba.
It was a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
I love her more than myself	Ofii koo caalaa ishee jaalladha
No one told me his name.	Namni maqaa isaa natti hime hin jiru.
That's not much.	Sun baay'ee miti.
So it goes, around and around.	Kanaaf ni deema, naannoo fi naannoo.
I said goodnight.	Halkan gaarii jedheen.
I didn't want to tell him	Ani itti himuu hin barbaanne
But nothing seemed problematic.	Garuu wanti rakkoo qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
I couldn’t make any money.	Maallaqa tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
He should have done it a long time ago	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura gochuu qaba ture
He is married and has two children.	Abbaa manaa fi ijoollee lama qaba.
I wanted to do something for you	Waan tokko siif gochuu barbaade
Everyone but me.	Ana malee nama hunda.
She needed a drink.	Dhugaatii ishee barbaachisa ture.
If that works, no problem for you.	Yoo sun hojjete rakkoon siif hin jiru.
I couldn’t see anyone else, just him	Nama biraa arguu hin dandeenye, isa qofa
Please, he said.	Maaloo jedhe.
I didn't even know what it was	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture
Not telling, though.	Himuu miti garuu.
You can go home.	Gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
She was here last year.	Bara darbe as turte.
It couldn't be my dog.	Saree koo ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I don’t understand how that works	Sun akkamitti akka hojjetu naaf hin galle
She still has a job.	Ammallee hojii qabdi.
I want to ask why this is important	Kun maaliif barbaachisaa akka ta’e gaafachuu barbaada
We have	Qabna .
If they weren't going to do it then someone else would have to do it.	Yoo isaan gochuuf hin deemne ta'e sana booda namni biraa gochuu qaba ture.
They were about the same age.	Umuriin isaanii gara wal fakkaatu turan.
I wonder if I still have them.	Ammallee isaan qabaa jedheen yaada.
He wasn’t in the mood	Miira keessa hin turre
One had come out.	Tokko ba'e ture.
But it seems to work.	Garuu waan hojjetu fakkaata.
It had to exist.	Jiraachuu qaba ture.
I didn’t know what to make of her	Maal akkan ishee godhu hin beeku ture
That wasn’t always the case	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre
He got the answer quickly.	Deebii isaa dafee argate.
I have to go to my mother	Gara haadha koo deemuun qaba
I knew it was a bad idea	Yaada hamaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture
I had the same thing	Anis kanuma qaba ture
A bar, he thought	Mana dhugaatii, ta'uu qaba jedhee yaade
He wants to go.	Deemu barbaada.
Too much noise, not enough homework .	Sagalee baay’ee, hojii manaa gahaa hin taane .
It may or may not be so.	Akkas ta’uu danda’a, ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I do, sometimes.	Ani nan godha, yeroo tokko tokko.
That's why it happens.	Kanaaf ni ta'a.
But he knew her.	Inni garuu ishee beeka ture.
They didn’t have to say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin qaban turan.
It looked good enough.	Gaarii gahaa fakkaata ture.
I don't want to live here.	As jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
Its time.	Yeroo isaa.
But I am being the reality	Ani garuu dhugaa jiru ta'aa jira
I can't fill them	Isaan guutuu hin danda'u
We are friends.	Nuti hiriyyoota.
But we don’t do that.	Garuu nuti akkas hin goonu.
So many people are lonely.	Kanaaf namoonni baay'een kophaa ta'u.
I was just doing my job.	Hojii koo qofa hojjechaa ture.
That’s my problem, not yours.	Sun rakkoo kooti malee kan kee miti.
She had another place.	Bakka biraa qabdi turte.
That is what we need most.	Kan hunda caalaa nu barbaachisu kanuma.
Those are the facts.	Isaan sun dhugaa jiru.
This is not this thing.	Kun waan kana miti.
I can't say enough about them	Waa'ee isaanii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
I know you’re out there	Akka ati ala jirtu nan beeka
He never did it again	Amma booda gonkumaa hin goone
Something like that happens.	Wanti akkasii ni ta'a.
I think maybe it's someone new	Tarii nama haaraa ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
He came here to be real.	Inni dhugaa ta'uuf as dhufe.
It has the right buttons	Qabduu sirrii ta'e qaba
But he could not do this.	Garuu kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
I knew he wouldn’t tell me everything	Waan hundumaa akka natti hin himne nan beeka ture
But she doesn't.	Isheen garuu hin gootu.
That’s usually how it happens.	Yeroo baay’ee akkasitti ta’a.
He has a lot of it.	Baay'ee qaba.
I did, and I will again.	Anis nan godhe, ammas nan godha.
About what really happened.	Waa'ee waan dhuguma ta'e.
I thought you could ask about her	Waa'ee ishee gaafachuu dandeessa jedheen yaade
That’s how I want to do it	Akkasitti gochuun barbaada
Not always, but often.	Yeroo hundumaa osoo hin taane, yeroo baay’ee.
He thought he could never tell her what had happened.	Waan ta'e yoomiyyuu itti himuu hin danda'u jedhee yaade.
Just a few lights.	Ifa muraasa qofa.
They are doing their job.	Hojii isaanii hojjechaa jiru.
You can’t see her.	Ishee arguu hin dandeessu.
Boy, they do.	Gurbaa, ni godhu.
I was important out there	Ani achi keessaa barbaachisaa ture
I couldn’t walk on them	Isaan irra deemuu hin dandeenye
I mean, I would never be a teacher	Silaa gonkumaa barsiisaa hin ta'u jechuu kooti
I really did not know what that meant	Dhuguma jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe hin beeku ture
I didn’t want to do it.	Ani gochuu hin barbaanne.
She has a voice.	Sagalee qabdi.
All well and good.	Hundi gaarii fi gaarii.
I just need one thing	Waan tokko qofa na barbaachisa
I won’t do that anymore	Kana booda akkas hin godhu
I don’t know exactly what to say.	Waan jedhu sirriitti hin beeku.
Nobody works here.	Asitti namni hojjetu hin jiru.
Never the same guy.	Gonkumaa gurbaa tokko miti.
We absolutely must.	Nuti guutummaatti dirqama.
I just didn’t see that much interest there	Fedhii hamma sanaa achitti hin argine qofa
I still can't believe he did that	Ammallee akkas akka godhe amanuu hin danda'u
There must be something else.	Waan biraa jiraachuu qaba.
What's going to happen.	Maal ta'a.
What should we do?.	Maal gochuu qabna?.
That’s one issue.	Sun dhimma tokko.
That wasn’t necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa hin turre.
I want no part of it	Ani kutaa isaa tokkollee hin barbaadu
We are in big trouble here.	Asitti rakkoo guddaa keessa jirra.
That may come later.	Sun booda dhufuu danda’a.
I love to eat a lot.	Baay'ee nyaachuu nan jaalladha.
I know you must have questions	Gaaffii qabaachuu akka qabdu nan beeka
She was there with some friends.	Hiriyyoota tokko tokko waliin achi turte.
Nobody really did.	Dhuguma namni godhe hin jiru.
He didn’t look good.	Inni gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
They really love each other.	Dhuguma wal jaallatu.
Man is never right or wrong.	Namni gonkumaa sirrii fi dogoggora hin qabu.
He knew this was very important.	Kun baayʼee barbaachisaa akka taʼe beeka ture.
At that time.	Yeroo sana.
Everything that could go wrong that day did	Guyyaa sana wanti dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼu hundi ni taʼe
I wouldn't have thought that would have been possible	Silaa sun ni danda'ama jedhee hin yaadu ture
You have no idea, really.	Yaada hin qabdu, dhuguma.
They want a dog.	Saree barbaadu.
It’s not a mistake.	Dogoggora miti.
He took me.	Na fudhate.
Some things you can't help but be, if that's a feeling.	Wantoota tokko tokko gargaaruu hin dandeenye kan ta'u, yoo sun miira ta'e.
It wasn't much.	Baay'ee hin turre.
I know everyone is different	Namni hundi adda akka ta'e nan beeka
I know he's different, but he loves me	Inni adda ta'uu isaa nan beeka, garuu na jaallata
He knew his job.	Hojii isaa ni beeka ture.
I love this job so much.	Hojii kana baay'een jaalladha.
But it didn’t last long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
But they didn't need much.	Garuu waan baay'ee isaan hin barbaachifne.
They are not children.	Isaan ijoollee miti.
I love him, I love him.	Ani isa jaalladha.
I'm pretty sure it's not yours.	Kan kee akka hin taane mirkanaa'aa dha.
I want to know everything about him	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa beekuu barbaada
So many things he thought about.	Kanaaf wantoota inni itti yaade hedduu.
I really mean this time	Dhuguma yeroo kana jechuu kooti
This seems to be what you have.	Kun waan ati qabdu fakkaata.
I really love it so much	Dhuguma baay'een jaalladha
I can't see how we can help that	Sana akkamitti gargaaruu akka dandeenyu arguu hin danda'u
Before, I meant to do you that	Kanaan dura, akkasitti si gochuuf jechuu kooti
He's trying to help me.	Na gargaaruuf yaalaa jira.
No one came home.	Namni gara manaatti dhufe hin jiru.
I really didn’t want to know	Dhuguma beekuu hin barbaanne
I am doing fine.	Ani gaarii hojjechaa jira.
It must be like me.	Akka koo ta'uu qaba.
A month later.	Ji'a tokko booda.
You are still working.	Ammas hojjechaa jirta.
Not great, but it would work, he told himself.	Guddaa miti garuu ni hojjeta jedhee ofitti hime.
I know what he means	Maal jechuu akka barbaade nan beeka
That was easy.	Sun salphaa ture.
This was a real thing.	Kun waan dhugaa ture.
This is not mine.	Kun kan koo miti.
Good night moon.	Halkan gaarii ji'a.
He sits on this one.	Isa kana irra taa'a.
Much better than me.	Na caalaa baayyee gaarii dha.
I really want to do this	Kana gochuu baay'een barbaada
My opinion is correct.	Yaada koo sirrii.
Sometimes I even thought she was wrong	Yeroo tokko tokko dogoggora akka qabdu illee nan yaada ture
One was his own.	Tokko kan isaa ture.
He didn’t go to school	Mana barumsaa hin deemne
If not, they would be today.	Osoo hin taane silaa har'a ta'u.
He had no sense of where he was going.	Miira bakka itti deemu hin qabu ture.
I said that of course	Ani akkas jedheen beekamaadha
I can't believe this	Kana amanuu hin danda'u
I could tell her how to handle it.	Akkamitti akka itti qabdu itti himuu nan dandaʼa ture.
I know his house.	Mana isaa nan beeka.
I know this issue.	Dhimma kana nan beeka.
I wasn’t expecting this	Kana eegaa hin turre
But we have no such situation in the present case.	Garuu dhimma amma jiru kana keessatti haala akkasii hin qabnu.
I don't know what happened.	Waan ta'e hin beeku.
But tell me more about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa caalaatti natti himi.
Now this seems unlikely.	Amma garuu kun waan hin taane fakkaata.
That one person was going to be me.	Namni tokko sun ana ta'uuf ture.
You might be lucky.	Carraa qabaachuu dandeessa.
It just seems wrong.	Dogoggora qofa fakkaata.
Everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hunda.
They work full time and long hours.	Yeroo guutuu fi sa’aatii dheeraa hojjetu.
I would never do that to you	Ani gonkumaa akkas si hin godhu ture
Like it really did one.	Akka dhuguma tokko hojjete.
I like it here with you	Asitti isin waliin natti tola
I know what happened	Waan ta'e nan beeka
I still don’t know if it works	Ammallee hojjechuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku
I know exactly who you two are	Lamaan keessan eenyu akka taate sirriitti beeka
But, it’s right.	Garuu, sirrii dha.
I thought we were friends	Hiriyyoota taane natti fakkaate
It just doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u qofa.
But he knew it.	Inni garuu ni beeka ture.
He had to find her.	Ishee argachuu qaba ture.
I shouldn’t have commented	Silaa yaada kennuu hin qabu ture
So you never know how.	Kanaaf akkamitti akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beektu.
You can stay.	Turuu dandeessu.
He was there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi ture.
I have to do what's right for me, you know	Waan naaf ta'u gochuun qaba, beekta
He knew not that night.	Halkan sana miti jedhee beeka ture.
He only speaks the truth.	Dhugaa qofa dubbata.
I have a lot of questions to ask you	Gaaffii baay'een si gaafachuu qaba
You have to see it.	Arguu qabda.
But she never told.	Garuu isheen gonkumaa hin himne.
I know everything now.	Waan hundumaa amma beeka.
I can't be without him	Isa malee ta'uu hin danda'u
And I just saw it then.	Anis yeroo sana qofa arge.
It was very good for us.	Baayyee gaarii nuuf ture.
I wanted to buy some new clothes	Uffata haaraa tokko tokko bitachuu barbaade
How could he not fit in.	Akkamitti inni hin galle ture.
I wanted to be these things	Wantoota kana ta'uu barbaade
I didn't know you	Ani si hin beekne
I didn't realize it was until after this	Hanga kana booda akka ta'e hin hubanne
So there are a few of us in there now.	Kanaaf amma achi keessa muraasa keenya.
Maybe that was speaking hope.	Tarii sun abdii dubbachuu ture ta'a.
But it was only for a while.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa ture.
I have no idea what happened.	Waan ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I can't imagine living without something like that	Waan akkasii malee jiraachuu yaadu hin danda'u
He asked for her help.	Gargaarsa ishee gaafate.
From here.	As irraa.
I think it’s more of the same.	Caalaatti kanuma natti fakkaata.
I love playing house	Mana taphachuu nan jaalladha
She doesn't do that very often.	Isheen akkas baay'ee hin gootu.
There were people all around me.	Naannoo koo hunda namoonni turan.
She thought she knew the answer.	Deebii isaa waan beektu itti fakkaate.
I have plenty of time to think about it	Yeroon itti yaadu baay'ee qaba
At the time, we had no names for these things.	Yeroo sanatti wantoota kanaaf maqaa hin qabnu turre.
I love some things in life.	Jireenya keessaa waan tokko tokko nan jaalladha.
But it will happen.	Garuu ni ta'a.
I can't seem to find what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru argachuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
I couldn’t leave you like that	Akkasitti si dhiisuu hin dandeenye
But, that doesn’t matter.	Garuu, sun homaa hin qabu.
I want to do what he wants	Waan inni barbaadu gochuu nan barbaada
You can be dangerous.	Balaa qabaachuu dandeessa.
I have been waiting.	Ani eegaa tureera.
They have a past.	Kan darbe qabu.
I just can't believe it	Ani qofa amanuu hin danda'u
She wasn’t there.	Isheen achi hin turre.
I didn't really think it could be you	Dhuguma si ta'uu danda'a jedhee hin yaadne
He thinks there is a joke.	Qoosaa waan jiru itti fakkaata.
But he still wasn't there.	Garuu ammas hin jiru ture.
He shouldn't come here.	As dhufuu hin qabu.
Maybe, he thought.	Tarii, jedhee yaade.
I had done nothing to help him in the past	Yeroo darbe waanan isa gargaaru homaa hin goone ture
That could have been true.	Silaa sun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
He should have been with her	Silaa ishee waliin ta'uu qaba ture
They were friends.	Hiriyyoota turan.
He lives right across the street.	Inni sirriitti karaa biraa jiraata.
Nothing was too dangerous	Wanti garmalee balaa qabu hin turre
I mean, I’ve known you for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf si beeka jechuu kooti.
I have to go in a little while.	Yeroo xiqqoo keessa deemuun qaba.
House in excellent condition.	Mana haala gaarii irra jiru.
I’m still working on it.	Ammallee irratti hojjechaa jira.
I didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
Love the idea.	Yaada jaalladhu.
I didn’t know what to think	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture
I think he'll be fine	Inni gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
I told him that he didn’t have to do that	Akkas gochuun dirqama akka hin qabne itti hime
By itself, it’s fine.	Ofii isaatiin, gaarii dha.
You don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabdu.
I mean, look at this place	Bakka kana ilaalaa jechuu kooti
I really mean this	Dhuguma kana jechuu kooti
I love him, I love him.	Ani isa nan jaalladha.
I really didn't want that to happen	Dhuguma wanti akkasii akka ta'u hin barbaanne
I’m still searching for the truth	Ammallee dhugaa barbaadaa jira
I can't believe he's here	As jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
But now it's different.	Amma garuu adda ta'e.
I think it's important and necessary.	Waan barbaachisaa fi barbaachisaa ta'e natti fakkaata.
That wasn’t always the case	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre
I couldn't go back now	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
I wouldn't be able to recognize myself.	Silaa of beekuu hin danda'u ture.
They are no exception	Isaan kun kanaan ala miti
It’s not really true.	Dhuguma dhugaa miti.
I knew nothing about her at the time	Yeroo sanatti waaʼee ishee homaa hin beeku ture
We need to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
There would be time later.	Yeroon isaa booda ni jiraata ture.
Didn't know it would work.	Akka hojjetu hin beekne.
It's never been easy.	Salphaa ta'ee hin beeku.
I didn’t think anything of it	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne
As she knew it always would be.	Akkuma isheen beektu yeroo hunda ni ta'a.
It's going on right now	Yeroo ammaa kana deemaa jira
I didn’t think it was bad	Hamaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
No one knew his real name.	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa namni beeku hin turre.
We don't have time.	Yeroo hin qabnu.
I didn’t see any of them.	Tokkollee hin argine.
I never wanted to be anything but a girl.	Intala malee kan biraa ta'uu gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
This, right here.	Kun, sirriitti asitti.
Love this stuff.	Waan kana jaalladhu.
It was just the two of us this morning.	Ganama kana nu lamaan qofa turre.
We are here to help you.	Isin gargaaruuf as jirra.
He did the right thing.	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjete.
He told me that everything around me was bad.	Wanti naannoo koo jiru hundi hamaa akka ta'e natti hime.
Which they probably had.	Kan tarii qaban turan.
But then again.	Garuu sana booda ammas.
He wants a girl though	Intala barbaada garuu
You can’t see a bit of a bad spot.	Bakka hamaa xiqqoo arguu hin dandeessu.
You have one year.	Waggaa tokko qabda.
I really think she is her	Dhuguma isheen ishee natti fakkaata
I still didn’t even have a car	Ammallee konkolaataa illee hin qabu ture
I have a bad feeling about it.	Waa'ee kanaa miira hamaa qaba.
Something bad, even.	Waan hamaa, illee.
He would have had nothing.	Silaa homaa hin qabu ture.
That’s my day job.	Sun hojii guyyaa kooti.
I can no longer live with you and what you have become	Kana booda si fi waan ati taate waliin jiraachuu hin danda'u
The reason is obvious.	Sababni isaa ifaadha.
I want to do well here	Asitti gaarii hojjechuu barbaada
She wasn't there now.	Isheen amma hin turre.
I didn’t need her to want me	Isheen akka na barbaaddu na hin barbaachifne
I don’t want to know if she’s good enough for me.	Isheen naaf gaarii taate beekuu hin barbaadu.
Well and well you know it’s not like that.	Gaarii fi gaarii beekta akkas miti.
He had a date.	Guyyaa qaba ture.
It is still in operation.	Ammas hojii irra jira.
I knew there was a problem in there, again	Achi keessa rakkoon akka jiru nan beeka ture, ammas
It couldn't be simpler.	Kana caalaa salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
This was where they were not.	Kun bakka isaan hin jirre ture.
You know this stuff.	Waan kana ni beektu.
That was the worst thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa hamaa taʼe sun ture.
I don't know.	Ani hin beeku.
It should have been my life.	Silaa jireenya koo ta'uu qaba ture.
Something from my old life.	Jireenya koo durii keessaa waan tokko.
That would be the best.	Sun hunda caalaa gaarii ta'a.
I mean, it's nothing, of course	Homaa miti jechuu kooti, ​​beekamaadha
No one had much money.	Namni maallaqa guddaa qabu hin turre.
I had no idea how I was going to do that	Akkamitti akkan sana gochuuf deemu yaada hin qabu ture
Things were different now.	Amma wanti jiru adda ture.
They knew who we were.	Eenyu akka taane ni beeku turan.
It’s all around us.	Hundumaa naannoo keenya jira.
He didn't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himne.
I love your work so much	Hojii keessan baay'een jaalladha
It just wasn’t working for me.	Naaf hin hojjetu ture qofa.
I just didn't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture.
It won't be easy.	Salphaa hin ta'u.
I was doing this.	Ani kana gochaa ture.
He was working too hard.	Garmalee hojjechaa ture.
This seems to us to be an obvious fact.	Kun dhugaa ifa ta’e nutti fakkaata.
I didn't know exactly what it was	Sirriitti maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
After a while they all look the same.	Yeroo muraasa booda hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu.
He didn’t do any good.	Gaarii tokkollee hin hojjenne.
They waited an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko eegaa turan.
It was always different	Yeroo hundumaa adda ture
I don’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabu.
Good job.	Hojii gaarii.
Better to go without it.	Isa malee deemuu wayya.
There had to be more to it.	Kana caalaa wanti jiru jiraachuu qaba ture.
I didn’t want to meet one.	Tokko waliin wal arguu hin barbaanne.
This is not that book.	Kun kitaaba sana miti.
No one thinks of sleep.	Namni hirriba yaadu hin jiru.
He knows everything about us.	Waa'ee keenya waan hundumaa ni beeka.
We have to go with Him.	Isa waliin deemuu qabna.
But I don't think so.	Inni garuu natti hin fakkaatu.
I wanted the worst inside me.	Keessa kootti isa hamaa barbaade.
I told my mother	Anis haadha kootti hime
But even this wasn’t the worst.	Garuu kun illee isa hamaa hin turre.
I think it wasn’t a great idea	Yaada guddaa hin turre jedheen yaada
I need her to be.	Ishee na barbaachisa.
I have no idea how to go about this.	Kana akkamitti akkan deemu yaada hin qabu.
What happened to that?.	Sana maal ta'e?.
Everyone wants one.	Namni hundi tokko barbaada.
I thought we did really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjenne jedheen yaade.
I didn't know anything	Ani homaa hin beekne
More than the worst.	Hamaa caalaa.
Everyone inside was one of them.	Namni keessa jiru hundi isaan keessaa tokko ture.
It will be	Ni ta'a .
It was different then.	Yeroo sanatti adda ture.
I know you already know this	Kana duraan akka beektu nan beeka
He was the only one.	Inni qofa ture.
I want you here with me	Asitti na waliin si barbaada
I can't find a good way to do this though.	Kana gochuuf karaa gaarii ta'e garuu argachuu hin danda'u.
I mean, you can ask them questions	Gaaffii isaan gaafachuu dandeessu jechuu kooti
You have to know what you want from life.	Jireenya irraa maal akka barbaaddu beekuu qabda.
Many opportunities	Carraa hedduu
I can't stay with you.	Si bira turuu hin danda'u.
That’s absolutely essential.	Sun guutummaatti barbaachisaa dha.
I won't do it again.	Ammas hin godhu.
I'm just me.	Ani ana qofa.
I know you are right	Ati sirrii akka ta'e nan beeka
After what we just saw .	Waan amma argine booda .
Not too soon.	Dafee miti.
They would still have questions.	Silaa ammallee gaaffii qabu turan.
You can’t do a little better.	Xiqqoo kana caalaa hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
But he wanted to.	Inni garuu barbaade.
Very sorry.	Baayyee dhiifama.
He should have known it would go that way	Silaa akkas akka deemu beekuu qaba ture
I need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuun na barbaachisa.
You were older than me.	Ati na caalaa nama guddaa turte.
I had to make that clear	Sana ifa gochuun qaba ture
I mean everyone saw it	Namni hundi arge jechuu kooti
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
No one understood.	Namni hubate hin jiru.
But sometimes, it’s not that simple.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko, hangas salphaa miti.
So there’s really no right or wrong.	Kanaaf dhuguma sirrii fi dogoggora hin jiru.
So many questions and no answers	Gaaffii baay'ee fi deebii hin qabne
I didn’t know what to do	Waan godhu hin beeku ture
But he was too different from her.	Inni garuu ishee irraa garmalee adda ture.
That is how people want to talk about him.	Akkasitti namoonni waaʼee isaa dubbachuu barbaadu.
I didn’t want all of this	Kana hunda hin barbaanne
But it was once something else.	Garuu yeroo tokko waan biraa ture.
But nothing is happening now.	Garuu waan amma ta'aa jiru hin jiru.
I didn’t really know her	Dhuguma ishee hin beekne ture
He should have stayed to help you	Si gargaaruuf turuu qaba ture
He had a mouth.	Afaan qaba ture.
But we have to be good.	Nuti garuu gaarii ta'uu qabna.
I didn't say anything	Ani homaa hin dubbanne
Repeat to yourself.	Ofitti irra deebi'i.
I walked towards him, not sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa osoo hin taane gara isaatti deeme.
Things like that.	Wantoota akkasii.
We did a lot of that.	Sana baay'ee hojjenne.
Just like in life.	Akkuma jireenya keessatti.
She hadn't wanted to admit it.	Isheen amanuu hin barbaanne turte.
I mean, we had a good thing going.	Waan gaarii deemaa turre jechuu kooti.
But he could do it.	Garuu gochuu danda'a ture.
It was without a man.	Nama malee ture.
I didn't want this to be about me	Kun waa'ee koo akka ta'u hin barbaanne
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
It wasn't too bad.	Baay'ee hamaa hin turre.
I looked good, for the most part	Ani gaarii fakkaata ture, irra caalaa
I never really know when that thing will come	Wanti sun yoom akka dhufu dhuguma gonkumaa hin beeku
But I didn't tell him that	Ani garuu akkas itti hin himne
I know you love her.	Akka ishee jaallattu nan beeka.
We didn’t realize we could do that	Akkas gochuu akka dandeenyu hin hubanne
Then he knows what the problem is.	Sana booda rakkoon jiru maal akka taʼe beeka.
I can't see how you could know	Akkamitti akka beekuu dandeessu arguu hin danda'u
I knew it was coming.	Akka dhufu nan beeka ture.
It couldn't be clearer	Kana caalaa ifa ta'uu hin danda'u
I didn’t say anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa hin dubbanne.
They still have hope.	Ammas abdii qabu.
It took some time.	Yeroo muraasa fudhate.
I love this time of year	Yeroo waggaa kana baay'een jaalladha
I think about it well.	Ani akka gaariitti itti yaada.
It was very vague.	Baayyee ifa hin taane ture.
I wondered what could have happened	Maaltu ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
I just wasn’t that person	Ani nama sana qofa hin turre
I was so happy to meet you both	Lamaan keessan waliin wal arguu kootti baay'een gammade
This is definitely coming.	Kun akka dhufu beekamaadha.
Sounds like a great time.	Yeroo guddaa fakkaata.
I have no idea what to make of that	Sana maal akkan godhu yaada hin qabu
Not even sure about me.	Waa'ee koo illee mirkanaa'aa miti.
Of course, there was nothing he could do.	Wanti inni gochuu dandaʼu akka hin jirre beekamaadha.
I know what’s ahead of me	Waan na dura jiru nan beeka
If you were some like that.	Osoo ati tokko tokko taate akkas.
You're there.	Achi jirta.
I thought I thought it was a good thing	Natti fakkaate waan gaarii natti fakkaate
It wasn’t me, of course.	Ana hin turre, beekamaadha.
It was hers.	Kan ishee ture.
I can't live in the past.	Kan darbe keessa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
It was the only thing she loved about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan isheen jaallattu isa qofa ture.
All of this is there.	Kun hundi ni jira.
I have to know.	Ani beekuu qaba.
Part of it is.	Kutaa isaa tokko.
She doesn't know the language.	Afaan hin beektu.
So where ???	Kanaaf bakka ???
It still doesn’t work.	Ammallee hin hojjetu.
Only you can know that.	Sana beekuu kan danda'u si qofa.
There was never anyone special in my house.	Mana koo keessatti namni adda ta'e gonkumaa hin jiru ture.
We weren’t one for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf tokko hin turre
I thought he meant drink	Dhugaatii jechuu isaa natti fakkaate
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
That means you can’t ask any questions.	Kana jechuun gaaffii tokkollee gaafachuu hin dandeessu.
Not sure that's a bad thing	Sun waan hamaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti
I know you want that	Akkas akka barbaaddu nan beeka
He's looking at you.	Si ilaalaa jira.
It never works like that.	Gonkumaa akkasitti hin hojjetu.
Time is nothing.	Yeroon homaa miti.
We are no different.	Nuti adda miti.
But I only saw one.	Garuu tokko qofa arge.
And it happened again.	Ammas ta'e.
Be there together.	Waliin achi ta'aa.
I was glad to help.	Gargaaruu kootti gammadeera.
His was in his car.	Kan isaa konkolaataa isaa keessa ture.
But not often.	Garuu yeroo baayyee miti.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
I wasn’t looking at her shoes	Kophee ishee ilaalaa hin turre
It wasn’t a thing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan hin turre.
I don’t mean that at all	Tasumaa akkas jechuu koo miti
Just like I did a year ago.	Akkuma waggaa tokko dura godhe.
I was looking for the door.	Balbala barbaadaa ture.
I want to give you a little something	Waan xiqqoo siif kennuu barbaada
Only one week.	Torban tokko qofa.
Probably not buying so many shoes any time soon.	Tarii yeroo dhiyootti kophee hamma kanaa bitachuu dhiisuu.
I was the only one who could see it	Kan arguu danda'u ana qofa ture
Most of the time it is right on.	Yeroo baayyee sirriitti irra jira.
Which isn’t a bad thing.	Kan waan hamaa hin taane.
It must be right.	Sirrii ta'uu qaba.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
I mean another chance with you	Carraa biraa si waliin jechuu kooti
This shouldn’t be the case.	Kun akkas ta’uu hin qabu.
I was just like my father	Anis akkuma abbaa koo ture
I had been waiting for her all day	Guyyaa guutuu ishee eegaa ture
I don’t think so anymore.	Kana booda akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
I had no idea about it	Waa'ee kanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
There is no one to help me.	Namni na gargaaru hin jiru.
But not now.	Garuu amma miti.
In our household.	Mana keenya keessatti.
It should work like clockwork.	Akka sa'aatii hojjechuu qaba.
. . . .	.
Maybe it wouldn’t work for you.	Tarii siif hin hojjetu ture.
I think you're right	Ati sirrii natti fakkaata
It is in our case.	Dhimma keenya keessa jira.
When he did, it was always something important.	Yeroo inni godhu yeroo hundumaa waan barbaachisaa ture.
You seem like a good person.	Ati nama gaarii fakkaata.
He should know this	Waan kana beekuu qaba
You’re doing that tonight.	Halkan kana akkas gochaa jirta.
I didn’t know him at all	Tasumaa isa hin beekne ture
Its new and bad.	Waan haaraa fi hamaa isaa.
I'm sure there must be such a thing	Wanti akkasii jiraachuu akka qabu mirkanaa'adha
There's a lot going on	Waan baay'een deemaa jira
I have something to tell you.	Waan sitti himu qaba.
I wasn’t expecting it	Ani eegaa hin turre
I would be.	Ani ....ta'a.
It caused the accident.	Balaa kanaaf sababa ta'e.
Clearly not now.	Amma akka hin taane ifaadha.
I can say that it did	Akkas ta'e jechuu nan danda'a
Only during the day.	Guyyaa qofa.
I want to know everything about her	Waa'ee ishee waan hundumaa beekuu barbaada
I knew you knew the whole truth	Dhugaa jiru guutuu akka beektu nan beeka ture
Something would have happened.	Silaa wanti tokko ni ta'a ture.
It was only a few weeks	Torban muraasa qofa ture
Something very important.	Waan baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e.
His timing was just like hers.	Yeroon isaa akkuma kan ishee ture.
He found a few things.	Waan muraasa argate.
But I have to go	Ani garuu deemuun qaba
They didn’t need my help.	Gargaarsa koo isaan hin barbaachifne.
I can't see your eyes	Ija kee arguu hin danda'u
I don't think that's very good.	Sun baay'ee gaarii natti hin fakkaatu.
She wasn’t a girl.	Isheen intala hin turre.
I never love anyone else	Ani gonkumaa nama biraa hin jaalladhu
This is correct, but only up to a point.	Kun sirrii dha, garuu hanga tokko qofa.
I think that will stay with me for the rest of my life	Sun jireenya koo guutuu na bira jiraata jedheen yaada
He has a long career.	Hojii yeroo dheeraa qaba.
Sometimes it was.	Yeroo tokko tokko ture.
Maybe it will happen, he said.	Tarii ni ta'a jedhe.
I can't believe we are husband and wife	Abbaa manaa fi haadha manaa ta'uu keenya amanuu hin danda'u
She had enough problems.	Rakkoo gahaa qabdi turte.
It wouldn't have been a bad life with her.	Silaa ishee waliin jireenya hamaa hin ta'u ture.
You’re working on this book.	Kitaaba kana irratti hojjechaa jirta.
But that’s just my opinion.	Garuu sun yaada koo qofa.
You can give us yourself.	Ofii nuuf kennuu dandeessu.
That doesn’t really matter.	Sun dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
I know what happened	Waan ta'e nan beeka
One of three things.	Waan sadii keessaa tokko.
But what works.	Garuu waan hojjetu.
I don’t know if we can survive	Jiraachuu akka dandeenyu hin beeku
I will do that.	Ani akkas nan godha.
I didn’t know what to make of him	Maal akkan isa godhu hin beeku ture
I can't believe what happened	Waan ta'e amanuu hin danda'u
That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t go.	Kana jechuun nuti deemuu hin qabnu jechuu miti.
I couldn’t believe it, a fellow	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye, nama akka kooti
I want the timing to be right	Yeroon isaa sirrii akka ta'u nan barbaada
I couldn’t do this anymore.	Kana booda kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
I wanted to ask you a few questions	Gaaffii muraasa si gaafachuu barbaade
The one in the area.	Kan naannoo sana jiru.
It should be early today.	Har'a dafee ta'uu qaba.
But no one could be sure.	Garuu namni mirkanaa'aa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
This is just part of it.	Kun kutaa isaa qofa.
This works well in most situations.	Kun haala baay’ee keessatti akka gaariitti hojjeta.
This time it is no problem.	Yeroo kana rakkoo hin qabu.
He was a good one.	Inni gaarii ture.
But she didn't think it would happen here.	Garuu asitti ni ta'a jettee hin yaadne.
I didn't want to be his food	Nyaata isaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
I know you can’t tell me	Natti himuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
It shouldn't have happened.	Silaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I don’t know why you didn’t tell me.	Maaliif akka natti hin himne hin beeku.
I was there, not like that	Ani achi ture, akkas miti
He is still here.	Ammallee as jira.
I didn’t know she was home	Mana akka jirtu hin beeku ture
He didn't know when it would come.	Yoom akka dhufu hin beekne.
This should happen for a while.	Kun yeroo muraasaaf ta’uu qaba.
Look at the bigger picture.	Suuraa guddaa ilaalaa.
That may not be what you want.	Sun waan ati barbaaddu taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I didn't know it was a dog	Saree ta'uu isaa hin beeku ture
If you don't understand.	Yoo hin hubanne ta'e.
I can't see any reason why he shouldn't	Sababni inni akka hin taane arguu hin danda'u
It didn’t go very well.	Baayyee gaarii hin deemne.
I care about you so much	Ani baay'een siif yaada
But I couldn’t see that.	Garuu sana arguu hin dandeenye.
This one is different.	Inni kun adda.
I think you would love something more	Waan kana caalaa ta'e ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
It could have been a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu danda'a ture.
He has a wife and three children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee sadii qaba.
I really didn’t know what to say	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
He still hadn't told anyone what had happened	Ammallee waan ta'e namatti hin himne ture
Lots of food.	Nyaata baay'ee.
Other.	Kan biraa.
He is a must.	Inni dirqama.
He should know.	Beekuu qaba.
Not everyone can do it.	Namni hundi gochuu hin danda'u.
I couldn't talk to anyone about it.	Waa'ee kanaa namatti dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
We can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
But people do good things.	Namoonni garuu waan gaarii hojjetu.
It was still daytime.	Ammallee guyyaa ture.
There was enough reason.	Sababni gahaa ture.
Now I can talk about other things	Amma waa'ee waan biraa dubbachuu nan danda'a
I think we have enough now	Amma waan gahaa qabna jedheen yaada
I just couldn’t believe he did all those things	Wantoota sana hunda akka godhe qofa amanuu hin dandeenye
I thought it was a complete disaster	Balaa guutuu natti fakkaate
We don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu.
It’s not clear exactly why he did that.	Maaliif akkas godhe sirriitti ifa miti.
All we have is today.	Wanti nuti qabnu har'a qofa.
I had my man.	Nama koo qaba ture.
He has to eat something else	Waan biraa nyaachuu qaba
You can work on some later.	Booda tokko tokko irratti hojjechuu dandeessu.
You can tell it will happen.	Akka ta'u himuu dandeessa.
I wanted to make it more special.	Caalaatti adda akka ta'u gochuu barbaade.
I think she’s just thinking about something else	Waan biraa qofa kan itti yaaddu natti fakkaata
That's how it happens together.	Akkas waliin ta'a.
It's still right.	Ammas sirrii dha.
I couldn't have done it without you	Osoo ati hin taane hin danda'u ture
It really just does.	Dhuguma qofa ni godha.
There was nothing more we could have done	Kana caalaa silaa gochuu dandeenyu hin turre
There was nothing else going on in her life at that point, he thought.	Jireenya ishee keessatti yeroo sanatti wanti biraa hin jiru jedhee yaade.
Where is.	Eessa jira.
I wanted him for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isa barbaade
That was a problem.	Sun rakkoo ture.
I can't say anything more.	Kana caalaa homaa jechuu hin danda'u.
I like what he’s doing	Waan inni hojjechaa jiru natti tola
I wasn't sure she could.	Isheen akka dandeessu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I just didn't know that was the case	Akkas akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
He was alone.	Inni kophaa isaa ture.
He was much older.	Inni baayʼee umuriin isaa guddaa ture.
Sometimes this can be true.	Yeroo tokko tokko kun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I knew then that he was beyond my help	Gargaarsa koo ol akka ta'e yeroo sanatti beeka ture
I just didn't think about it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waa'ee kanaa hin yaadne qofa ture.
He was not one of himself.	Inni nama ofii isaa keessaa tokko hin turre.
Very good friends.	Hiriyyoota baayyee gaarii.
Maybe you really should go now.	Tarii dhuguma amma deemuu qabda ta'a.
I know there is a problem	Rakkoon akka jiru nan beeka
All that stuff works.	Wanti sun hundi ni hojjeta.
I knew they were dangerous	Balaa akka qaban nan beeka ture
That would have been something.	Silaa sun waan tokko ture.
He’s not the guy out there who doesn’t know what he’s doing.	Inni gurbaa ala jiru kan waan hojjetu hin beekne miti.
I love you so, so truly and completely	Ani baay'een, baay'ee dhugaa fi guutummaatti si jaalladha
I can't give more than that.	Kana caalaa kennuu hin danda'u.
I think he did very well on that.	Sana irratti baayyee gaarii hojjete natti fakkaata.
I didn’t mean to say you couldn’t	Ani akka ati hin dandeenye jechuu hin barbaanne
It was a question.	Gaaffii ture.
That was important to him.	Sun isaaf barbaachisaa ture.
I could go now.	Amma deemuu nan danda'a ture.
I didn’t know what to tell him	Waan itti himu hin beeku ture
You're a lot like him.	Ati baay'ee isa fakkaata.
Someone else has to do the other work	Hojii biraa namni biraa hojjechuu qaba
I knew them very well.	Baayyee gaarii isaan beeka ture.
I'm just so so happy she's with me	Ani qofa baay'ee baay'ee gammade isheen na waliin jirtu
He knows the right answer.	Deebii sirrii ta'e ni beeka.
That’s not why.	Kanaaf miti.
She couldn't be.	Isheen ta'uu hin dandeenye.
Something could be wrong	Wanti tokko dogoggora ta'uu danda'a
It has to come.	Dhufuu qaba.
You know it’s nothing.	Homaa akka hin taane beekta.
He still wants to be human	Ammas nama ta'uu barbaada
Or is there?.	Moo jiraa?.
I know it’s not right.	Sirrii akka hin taane nan beeka.
He wasn't sure what to do	Maal akka godhu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I haven’t had that for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas hin qabu
I just don’t know where to go from here.	As irraa eessa akkan deemu qofa hin beeku.
They are good things in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti wantoota gaarii dha.
I looked the other way	Anis karaa biraa ilaale
I was thinking that.	Ani akkas jedheen yaada ture.
He didn't have much to say.	Waan baay'ee jedhu hin qabu ture.
He really should have known something was wrong	Silaa dhuguma wanti tokko dogoggora akka ta'e beekuu qaba ture
I absolutely don’t know any	Ani guutummaatti tokkollee hin beeku
In a household.	Mana tokko keessatti.
I love how it turned out.	Akkamitti akka ta'e baay'een jaalladha.
I mean, you can stay	Turuu dandeessa jechuu kooti
I knew it had to be his father	Abbaa isaa ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture
They want to know more.	Caalaatti beekuu barbaadu.
It’s my mistake.	Dogoggora kooti.
I knew it would happen, one day	Akka ta'u nan beeka ture, guyyaa tokko
It is necessary.	Barbaachisa.
I couldn’t see his eyes	Ija isaa arguu hin dandeenye
I think there’s an opportunity to do some good	Carraan waan gaarii tokko tokko hojjechuuf jira jedheen yaada
He was right, of course.	Inni sirrii akka ture beekamaadha.
I don't think it should	Hin qabu jedheen yaada
I didn’t see it then.	Yeroo sana hin argine.
Just like my people.	Akkuma namoota koo.
If so , it is	Yoo akkas ta'e .
I think she doesn’t have to	Isheen dirqama hin qabdu jedheen yaada
Nothing else really matters.	Wanti biraa dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
So far so obvious.	Hanga ammaatti akkas ifaadha.
But, it happened.	Garuu, ni ta'e.
I can just be with them	Isaan waliin ta'uu qofa nan danda'a
The two must be very different.	Lamaan isaanii baayyee adda ta'uu qabu.
I’m bright, you know	Ani ifaadha, beekta
It doesn’t help.	Hin gargaaru.
He and his mouth.	Inni fi afaan isaa.
I think you can do it	Ni dandeessu jedheen yaada
If we had stayed together, things would have been different.	Osoo waliin turre silaa wanti hundi adda ta'a ture.
But we don’t have it.	Garuu hin qabnu.
I'm sure you have yours.	Kan kee akka qabdu mirkanaa'adha.
They don’t have kids together.	Ijoollee waliin hin qaban.
The worst of it.	Isa keessaa isa hamaa.
Your time is not now.	Yeroon kee amma miti.
She was all wrong.	Hundi ishee dogoggora turte.
He is a human being.	Inni nama.
I did that, really.	Ani akkas godhe, dhuguma.
When it is out of season.	Yeroo yeroon isaa ala ta'u.
Maybe you're not quite there yet.	Tarii ammallee guutummaatti achi hin jirre ta'a.
The time for action is now.	Yeroon gochaa amma.
I shouldn’t have spoken to you like that	Silaa akkasitti sitti dubbachuu hin qabu ture
It’s not just a contemporary thing.	Waan yeroo sanaa qofa miti.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay’ee.
It may even be funny at the time.	Yeroo sanatti qoosaa illee taʼuu dandaʼa.
Having some time.	Yeroo muraasa qabaachuu.
I like it a little bit	Xiqqoo natti tola
He looked at her again	Ammas ishee ilaale
You can get that.	Sana argachuu dandeessa.
I couldn’t see inside.	Keessatti arguu hin dandeenye.
I’m still working on something.	Ammallee waan tokko irratti hojjechaa jira.
He went on it.	Irratti deeme.
It was in excellent condition.	Haala gaarii irra ture.
We didn’t agree with everything, but that doesn’t matter.	Waan hunda irratti walii hin galle, garuu sun hin barbaachisu.
I’m still pleased with myself	Ammallee ofitti gammadeera
But not my father.	Garuu abbaa koo miti.
But this one didn't understand that.	Inni kun garuu sana homaa hin hubanne.
Maybe he didn't do it sooner.	Tarii dafee hin goone ta'a.
You can have that one.	Isa sana qabaachuu dandeessa.
I really enjoyed this bar.	Mana dhugaatii kana baay'een gammade.
I couldn’t tell him anything.	Homaa itti himuu hin dandeenye.
I wanted to quit that morning	Ganama sana dhiisuu barbaade
Life after life.	Jireenya jireenya booda.
I hope we can help each other.	Wal gargaaruu akka dandeenyu abdiin qaba.
This was too late.	Kun yeroon booda ture.
What was happening now was happening then.	Wanti amma ta'aa ture yeroo sana ta'aa ture.
It took me two weeks.	Torban lama natti fudhate.
But that was nothing new.	Garuu sun waan haaraa hin turre.
You can't ask anyone.	Nama gaafachuu hin dandeessu.
He didn’t do it that day.	Guyyaa sana hin goone.
The catch of the day.	Qabduu guyyaa sanaa.
I can't see anything about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa arguu hin danda'u
It wasn’t just me	Ana qofa hin turre
He says he doesn’t care who comes with us.	Eenyu akka nu waliin dhufu dhimma hin qabu jedha.
He probably won't do it again	Ammas hin godhu ta'a
He said it was possible.	Ni danda'ama jedhe.
I can't stay here without you	Si malee as turuu hin danda'u
This has always been the case	Yeroo hundumaa kana ture
I thought so.	Akkas jedheen yaade.
A little something for you	Waan xiqqoo siif ta'u
I want to stay that way for a bit	Xiqqoo akkasitti turuu barbaada
But he thought about it.	Inni garuu ni yaade.
He would have been better off yelling more	Silaa kana caalaa iyyuu isaatiin gaarii ture
His mouth found hers again.	Afaan isaa ammas kan ishee argate.
He was trying to do the right thing.	Waan gaarii hojjechuuf yaalaa ture.
I am very, very good	Ani baayyee baayyee gaarii dha
My! 	Koo!
But I can't do that.	Ani garuu kana gochuu hin danda'u.
I had the dog in my arms	Saree sana harka koo keessaa qaba ture
No one knew he was here.	As akka jiru namni beeku hin turre.
In the afternoon he was waiting.	Waaree booda inni eegaa ture.
It didn't work.	Hin hojjenne.
You have to ask him this.	Kana isa irraa gaafachuu qabda.
There are two reasons.	Sababni lama jira.
I really don't know why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I think he's right.	Inni sirrii natti fakkaata.
You will love this.	Kana ni jaallattu.
There was no one to tell us what to do	Namni maal akka goonu nutti himu hin turre
It wasn’t his time, he wasn’t in any mood.	Yeroon isaa hin turre, miira tokkollee keessa hin turre.
What did he do.	Maal godhe.
I could believe that	Kana amanuu nan dandaʼa ture
It was in everything he did.	Waan inni hojjete hunda keessa ture.
There must be something more.	Kana caalaa wanti jiru jiraachuu qaba.
I wish it was that easy	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee natti tola
But they are in trouble.	Garuu rakkoo keessa jiru.
I wasn’t one of those	Ani warra kana keessaa tokko hin turre
He saw many people there	Bakka sanatti namoota hedduu arge
Just like she was.	Akkuma isheen turte.
He is completely helpless in her hands	Harka ishee keessaa guutummaatti gargaarsa hin qabu
Proper.	Kan ta'u.
I think it will be long tonight	Halkan kana dheeraa ta'a jedheen yaada
Some must have answers.	Tokko tokko deebii qabaachuu qaba.
He is in everything.	Inni waan hundumaa keessa jira.
I would never be good enough for him	Ani gonkumaa isaaf gaarii hin ta'u ture
That’s exactly right.	Kanuma sirrii dha.
I want to do the right thing	Waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuu nan barbaada
It was what he did best.	Waan inni hunda caalaa hojjete ture.
You should have seen it.	Silaa arguu qabda turte.
I was very pleased with it	Ani baay'een itti gammade
Maybe it's just him.	Tarii isa qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I couldn’t find any problems	Rakkoo tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
I really enjoyed this book	Kitaaba kana baay'een itti gammade
Look people in the eye.	Namoota ija keessa ilaalaa.
We used to have this, but we don’t anymore.	Duraan kana qabna turre, kana booda garuu hin qabnu.
In that case it may not be current.	Haala sana keessatti yeroo ammaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
He says it might be important.	Barbaachisaa ta'uu danda'a jedha.
I have no idea if it's bad or not.	Hamaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa yaada hin qabu.
I never know.	Ani gonkumaa hin beeku.
Isn’t that one thing? 	Sun waan tokko mitii?
They certainly don’t understand.	Isaan akka hin hubanne beekamaadha.
I don't think so.	Akkas jedhee hin yaadu.
It could be something environmental.	Waan naannoo ta'uu danda'a.
I know it wasn’t.	Akka hin turre nan beeka.
I think it's a good place for him.	Bakka gaarii isaaf ta'u natti fakkaata.
Do you have any other ideas?.	Yaada biraa qabduu?.
It will be a great thing for him.	Isaaf waan guddaa ta'a.
But this is not a new problem.	Garuu kun rakkoo haaraa miti.
I think that’s right	Sun sirrii natti fakkaata
It was really too much of a good thing.	Dhuguma waan gaarii garmalee ture.
I'm happy too.	Anis gammadeera.
I love you and I just want what's best for you	Si jaalladha waan siif ta'u qofa barbaada
It was just what she wanted.	Waan isheen barbaaddu qofa ture.
I'm waiting for one.	Tokko eegaa jira.
It wasn’t lucky though.	Carraa hin turre garuu.
You don’t do these things.	Wantoota kana hin gootu.
It was not a very good picture.	Suuraa baayyee gaarii hin turre.
I didn’t think that was the right job.	Sun hojii sirrii natti hin fakkaatu ture.
It doesn’t go any further right now	Yeroo ammaa kana kana caalaa hin deemu
He was still with me.	Inni ammallee na waliin ture.
I always loved his hands	Yeroo hundumaa harka isaa nan jaalladha ture
I've often thought that.	Yeroo baay'ee akkas jedheen yaada ture.
I can be for you.	Siif ta'uu nan danda'a.
I love all of these things	Wantoota kana hunda nan jaalladha
It always happened.	Yeroo hunda ni ta'a ture.
How come I didn't think of it before? 	Akkamitti ta'e kanaan dura hin yaadne?
I just can't live with this anymore	Kana booda kanaan jiraachuu qofa hin danda'u
What's more, you know it's true.	Kan biraa maaltu jira, dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekta.
Not that it was.	Akka ture miti.
It has nothing but time	Yeroo malee homaa hin qabu
No one seems to be home right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana namni mana jiru hin fakkaatu.
This was another day of work for us.	Kun guyyaa hojii biraa nuuf ture.
I would love to go back one day.	Guyyaa tokko duubatti deebi'uu nan jaalladha.
I know where you are	Bakka jirtu nan beeka
Only for a short time.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
Not sure why it didn't work.	Maaliif akka hin hojjenne mirkanaa'aa miti.
We have people like him.	Namoota akka isaa qabna.
He couldn't do anything to me.	Homaa na gochuu hin dandeenye.
He thought it was so good.	Akkas gaarii itti fakkaate.
He never gave any answer.	Deebii tokkollee kenne hin beeku.
From their parents.	Warra isaanii irraa.
I know a lot of your work.	Hojii keessan baay'een beeka.
This seems like a big deal.	Kun waan guddaa fakkaata.
I thought about it a lot	Baay'een itti yaade
It was terrible.	Hamaa ture.
I know the date, the time	Guyyaa, sa'aatii nan beeka
You’re one thing.	Ati waan tokko.
Wouldn't that be good?.	Sun gaarii hin ta'uu?.
I didn’t mean for you to leave	Ani akka ati deemtu jechuu hin turre
But I don’t know how to do it.	Garuu akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
This isn't going to happen.	Kun hin ta'u.
I’m not up on anything anymore.	Kana booda waan tokko irratti ol hin jiru.
A subject you know well	Dhimma ati sirriitti beektu
But that has a time and a place.	Garuu sun yeroo fi bakka qaba.
That’s what I said when we met.	Yeroo wal argine akkas jedheen ture.
It was very large.	Baayyee guddaa ture.
But you can have something.	Garuu waan tokko qabaachuu dandeessa.
I want to know about this happening.	Waa'ee ta'aa jiru kana beekuu barbaada.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
But it’s not a big deal.	Garuu waan guddaa miti.
I know you did your best	Waan dandeessu hunda akka goote nan beeka
I hope she can go with us	Isheen nu waliin deemuu akka dandeessu abdiin qaba
But she is not like that.	Isheen garuu akkas miti.
I just can't do that right now	Yeroo ammaa kana akkas gochuu qofa hin danda'u
More than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa.
He said that he did.	Akka godhe jedhe.
This should be our problem from now on.	Kun kana booda rakkoo keenya ta'uu qaba.
I want to ask you about this	Waa'ee kanaa isin gaafachuu barbaada
It will never be perfect	Yoomiyyuu guutuu hin ta'u
I saw something in you	Waan tokko si keessatti arge
I hadn’t thought about it.	Ani itti hin yaadne ture.
You know it's too late.	Yeroo booda ta'uu isaa beekta.
I didn’t even have to ask	Gaafachuu illee hin qabu ture
Like her mother.	Akkuma haadha ishee.
Lots of danger there.	Balaa baay'ee achitti.
I'm doing pretty good.	Ani baayyee gaarii ta'aa jira.
All over my hands.	Harka koo hunda irra.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
But, you don’t have the money.	Garuu, qarshii hin qabdu.
I didn't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I almost did it again	Ammas gochuuf jedheen ture
But it does the job well.	Garuu hojii sana akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I don't think I can have it	Akka kootti qabaachuu hin danda'u
That’s all she has to do.	Wanti isheen gochuu qabdu kanuma qofa.
This should go both ways.	Kun karaa lamaan deemuu qaba.
This means that we have light within us.	Kana jechuun ifa keessa keenya qabna.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
Just a very bad feeling.	Miira baay'ee hamaa qofa.
I really like this guy	Gurbaa kana baay'een jaalladha
He shouldn’t be here yet	Ammallee as jiraachuu hin qabu
He can give them away.	Isaan kennuu dandaʼa.
I didn’t want to have that fact.	Dhugaa sana qabaachuu hin barbaanne.
I doubt it, either.	Anis nan shakka.
She had no drinking problems.	Rakkoo dhugaatii hin qabdu turte.
As is probably the case.	Akkuma ta'uu hin oolle.
Maybe we shouldn’t believe him.	Tarii isa amanuu hin qabnu.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
He should have been watching him	Silaa isa ilaalaa jiraachuu qaba ture
No one knows this.	Kana namni beeku hin jiru.
I want to do something	Waan tokko hojjechuu barbaada
I just don’t think it’s right.	Qofa sirrii natti hin fakkaatu.
He didn’t do the right thing.	Waan sirrii hin hojjenne.
I could be there with them	Isaan waliin achi jiraachuu nan dandaʼa ture
That couldn't be more wrong.	Sun kana caalaa dogoggora ta'uu hin danda'u.
He said something very simple.	Waan baayyee salphaa ta'e dubbate.
I think that's a very unreasonable idea	Sun yaada baayyee sababa hin qabne natti fakkaata
I could never believe it	Ani gonkumaa amanuu hin dandeenye
I don’t want to live like that anymore.	Kana booda akkas jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
I was alone with my thoughts	Yaada koo waliin kophaa koo ture
I just didn’t see things coming.	Wantoota dhufuu qofa hin argine.
I think you should buy us something	Waan tokko nuuf bitachuu qabda jedheen yaada
I knew he was right but still	Sirrii akka ta'e nan beeka ture garuu ammas
It was late in the afternoon again.	Ammas waaree booda ture.
I wondered why she did that	Maaliif akkas goote jedheen yaade
She should have known.	Isheen beekuu qabdi turte.
A big drink, please.	Dhugaatii guddaa maaloo.
There is no exception.	Kan kanaan ala hin jiru.
They were on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra turan.
Not good enough.	Gaarii gahaa miti.
I can't come with you	Si waliin dhufuu hin danda'u
I didn’t see any of them	Tokkollee hin argine
We need many things.	Wantoota hedduu nu barbaachisa.
I couldn't say anything	Homaa jechuu hin dandeenye
He didn't say that	Waan sana hin dubbanne
We had to be that hope.	Abdii sana taʼuu qabna turre.
I didn’t understand the problem, I didn’t understand	Rakkoo jiru hin hubanne, hin hubanne
Not for very long.	Baayyee yeroo dheeraaf miti.
You are mine.	Ati kooti.
That didn’t last long.	Sun yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I have my job.	Hojii koo qaba.
I didn’t know you were here	As akka jirtu hin beeku ture
But not now, not now.	Garuu amma miti, amma miti.
It can only do so much	Waan baay'ee qofa hojjechuu danda'a
I want you to leave now	Amma akka deemtu barbaada
You, me, everything.	Ati, ana, hunda.
It has a good one.	Gaarii qaba.
But something in my life wasn’t perfect.	Garuu jireenya koo keessatti wanti tokko guutuu hin turre.
It was his only.	Kan isaa qofa ture.
I want you there with me	Na waliin achitti si barbaada
She was in grave danger.	Balaa guddaa keessa turte.
But that was a long time ago.	Garuu sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
I think you are something else	Ati waan biraa natti fakkaata
But I can't say	Ani garuu jechuu hin danda'u
And now they can even be something else.	Ammas waan biraa illee ta’uu danda’u.
I think you could have done better.	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa jedheen yaada.
It wasn’t entirely on its own.	Guutummaatti ofuma isaatiin hin turre.
I mean really love it.	Dhuguma jaalladhu jechuu kooti.
I mean, it was bad.	Hamaa ture jechuu kooti.
That's what's important.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
But it’s different for you.	Garuu siif adda.
Always love me like this.	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti na jaalladhu.
You are not her mother.	Ati haadha ishee miti.
Big mistake with an adult	Dogoggora guddaa nama guddaa waliin
You don’t need it anymore	Kana booda si hin barbaachisu
He saw her interest in him again.	Fedhii isheen isaaf qabdu ammas arge.
I hadn’t seen that coming	Sun dhufuu isaa hin argine ture
I don't even know what happened.	Waan ta'e illee hin beeku.
I could see them, but they couldn't see me	Isaan arguu nan danda'a ture, isaan garuu na arguu hin dandeenye
I was pretty good at it	Ani baay'ee gaarii ture
It looks pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
All I want is to be with you again.	Wanti ani barbaadu ammas si waliin ta'uu qofa.
But that was the problem.	Garuu rakkoon sun kanuma ture.
You are here to stay.	Ati turuuf as jirta.
They were good.	Isaan gaarii turan.
I never did, except for one that wasn’t.	Ani gonkumaa hin goone, tokko kan akkas hin taane malee.
I have known far worse than you in my time	Yeroo kootti si caalaa baayʼee hamaa taʼe beeka
You are not a father.	Ati abbaa miti.
It must be later.	Booda ta'uu qaba.
It was very different.	Baayyee adda ture.
I couldn’t find a good way to do this though	Kana gochuuf karaa gaarii argachuu hin dandeenye garuu
Everything happens in a context.	Wanti hundi haala tokko keessatti ta'a.
I wonder what it will be	Maal ta'a jedheen yaada
I haven't told him yet	Hanga ammaatti itti hin himne
He seems to know his job.	Hojii isaa waan beeku fakkaata.
Just two years later.	Waggaa lama qofa booda.
Opportunities there are few.	Carraan achi jiru muraasa.
I should have told you long ago by now	Silaa amma dura yeroo dheeraa sitti himuu qaba ture
One thing was right.	Wanti tokko sirrii ture.
I have no problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoo hin qabu.
Always old, always new.	Yeroo hundumaa durii, yeroo hundumaa haaraa dha.
He looks good and looks really good.	Inni gaarii fakkaata dhuguma gaarii fakkaata.
I think he did that.	Inni akkas godhe natti fakkaata.
I thought it was mine	Kan koo natti fakkaate
I don't understand what's going on here.	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle.
I know you want this.	Kana akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
That’s just a name.	Sun maqaa qofa.
He was willing to help.	Gargaaruuf fedhii qaba ture.
I don't like anything about you.	Waa'ee kee homaa hin jaalladhu.
So everyone was happy.	Kanaaf namni hundi gammade.
Again, this is nothing new.	Ammas kun waan haaraa miti.
I don't think it's anything	Ani homaa natti hin fakkaatu
I wouldn’t want him to	Ani akka inni godhu hin barbaadu ture
It did them a lot of good	Gaarii baay'ee isaan hojjete
Age is important.	Umuriin barbaachisaa dha.
I really don’t know where that time went.	Dhuguma yeroon sun eessa akka deeme hin beeku.
You love each other.	Wal jaallattu.
He saw something no one else did	Waan namni biraa hin hojjenne arge
I couldn’t live here	As jiraachuu hin dandeenye
It was his own.	Kan isaa ture.
I was out there.	Ani achi ala ture.
That's what it's supposed to be.	Sun ta'uu qaba.
It doesn’t matter what a person was in the past.	Namni tokko yeroo darbe maal akka ture homaa hin qabu.
I can't do this.	Ani kana gochuu hin danda'u.
He knew that voice well	Sagalee sana sirriitti beeka ture
He is certainly right.	Inni sirrii akka taʼe beekamaadha.
I couldn’t find any problems	Rakkoo tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
I was working.	Ani hojjechaa ture.
But nothing worked for me.	Garuu wanti naaf hojjete hin jiru.
I think this is very important	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
It's just too big.	Baayyee guddaa qofa.
He should know exactly who he is	Eenyu akka ta'e sirriitti beekuu qaba
I didn’t have any problems.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin qabu ture.
That worked really well.	Sun dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjete.
I didn’t think it was a good idea.	Yaada gaarii natti hin fakkaatu ture.
I just started to be human.	Ani amma nama ta'uu jalqabe.
It really wasn’t.	Dhuguma hin turre.
Enough of the large amount	Hamma guddaa gahaa
He must tell the whole story.	Guutuu isaa himuu qaba.
That should never have happened.	Sun gonkumaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I think he knows it.	Inni waan beeku natti fakkaata.
I wanted more from him	Caalaatti isa irraa argachuu barbaade
I know it will happen	Akka ta'u nan beeka
I looked up at him.	Anis ol jedheen ilaale.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
They look good.	Isaan gaarii fakkaatu.
They like to do that.	Isaan akkas gochuu jaallatu.
They know themselves in it.	Isa keessatti of beeku.
Then, they had another great idea.	Sana booda, yaada guddaa biraa qaban.
I wonder what he will do.	Maal godha jedheen yaada.
But one thing is right.	Waan tokko garuu sirrii dha.
I can see them all right	Ani sirriitti isaan arguu nan danda'a
He's making a joke.	Qoosaa hojjechaa jira.
I was expecting this	Kana eegaa ture
I went here, too.	Anis as deeme.
He was home again.	Ammas mana ture.
You have the right person.	Nama sirrii qabda.
What happened is now clear to us.	Waan ta'e amma ifa nuuf ta'e.
It's unclear what happened next	Kana booda maaltu akka ta'e ifa miti
I know exactly what you are	Maal akka taate sirriitti beeka
Nothing that important, you know.	Wanti hangas barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru, beekta.
I was looking for you	Si barbaadaa ture
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammade.
I love that about him	Waa'ee isaa sana nan jaalladha
He really had it.	Dhuguma qaba ture.
They all have one thing in common.	Hundi isaanii waan wal fakkaatu tokko qabu.
He was in serious danger.	Balaa hamaa keessa ture.
I should have said something earlier	Silaa kanaan dura waan tokko dubbachuu qaba ture
But in time they will.	Yeroo booda garuu ni ta'u.
I know a lot of people up there	Namoota hedduu achi ol nan beeka
He has no children.	Ijoollee hin qabu.
I saw no other way.	Karaa biraa hin argine.
She certainly didn’t.	Isheen akka hin goone beekamaadha.
She had that good.	Gaarii sana qabdi turte.
Two weeks ago about.	Torban lama dura waa'ee.
He should never have been in that situation	Silaa gonkumaa haala sana keessa jiraachuu hin qabu ture
I knew what he was doing.	Waan inni hojjechaa jiru nan beeka ture.
I knew she didn’t want to give him away	Isa kennuu akka hin barbaanne nan beeka ture
I didn’t even do that	Ani akkas illee hin goone
We have plenty of time.	Yeroo hedduu qabna.
I wouldn’t tell him that.	Ani akkas itti hin himu.
I hope it works out well for you	Akka gaariitti akka siif ta'u abdiin qaba
Nothing else is more important.	Wanti biraa caalaa barbaachisaa ta’e tokkollee hin jiru.
I didn’t really know their names until now.	Maqaa isaanii hanga ammaatti dhuguma hin beeku ture.
I knew he had it for me	Naaf akka qabu nan beeka ture
I know what you want.	Waan barbaaddu nan beeka.
A very long time indeed	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa dhuguma
I couldn’t see that.	Sana arguu hin dandeenye.
I hadn’t seen anyone	Nama tokkollee hin argine ture
I was like that.	Ani akkas ture.
They are always there for me.	Yeroo hundumaa naaf jiru.
That was the right thing to do.	Wanti sirrii taʼe sun ture.
I knew he wanted to do something else	Waan biraa hojjechuu akka barbaadu nan beeka ture
You know you have to live without.	Malee jiraachuu akka qabdu ni beekta.
I need Him to help me	Inni akka na gargaaru na barbaachisa
You can be right.	Sirriitti dubbachuu dandeessa.
This isn’t exactly the case.	Kun sirriitti hin ta’u.
I have two problems in this case.	Dhimma kana keessatti rakkoo lama qaba.
I just didn't know what it was	Maal akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
I want to know more	Kana caalaa beekuu barbaada
It only worked a couple of times.	Yeroo lama lama qofa hojjete.
There was nothing these men did not do.	Wanti namoonni kun hin goone hin turre.
I was really trying	Dhuguma yaalaa ture
That way I can see so much more	Akkasitti waan baay'ee arguu nan danda'a
I said what he thinks	Waan inni yaadu jedheen
Things happened very quickly after that.	Sana booda wanti baay’ee dafee ta’e.
But it really does work.	Garuu dhuguma ni hojjeta.
Time doesn't matter.	Yeroon homaa hin qabu.
Maybe you have them.	Tarii isaan qabda ta'a.
I don't understand why this happened.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle.
Look at something else.	Waan biraa ilaalaa.
Long episode, and excellent.	Kutaa dheeraa, fi baayyee gaarii dha.
I have to go.	Ani deemuun qaba.
A new life, together	Jireenya haaraa, waliin
We did our job.	Hojii keenya hojjenne.
They want it.	Isaan barbaadu.
It’s never a bad thing.	Gonkumaa waan hamaa miti.
There was little else she could do.	Wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu kan biraa xiqqoo ture.
Not as good as a real book, though.	Akka kitaaba dhugaa gaarii miti garuu.
I don’t know what they were expecting before.	Kanaan dura maal eegaa akka turan hin beeku.
I thought this was a good idea	Kun yaada gaarii natti fakkaate
I really don’t know what to do now	Dhuguma amma maal akkan godhu hin beeku
I was again.	Ani ammas ture.
I hadn’t seen him in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf hin argine ture
This was not going to go well.	Kun akka gaariitti deemuuf hin turre.
She had many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qabdi turte.
I think that’s a great idea	Sun yaada guddaa natti fakkaata
It doesn't have a sound.	Sagalee hin qabu.
It was one of the few things that couldn't happen.	Wantoota muraasa ta'uu hin dandeenye keessaa tokko ture.
You can see the house.	Mana sana arguu dandeessu.
I only have a little time	Yeroo xiqqoo qofa qaba
We need to make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuu qabna.
It was terrible.	Hamaa ture.
He knew me my whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu na beeka ture.
She was mine.	Isheen kan koo turte.
I had no idea this could happen	Kun ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu ture
I can make this clear.	Kana ifa gochuu nan danda'a.
It didn't work.	Hin hojjenne.
I have the same problem	Anis rakkoo wal fakkaatu qaba
I think it should be very soon	Baayyee dafee ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
I didn't want to see you	Si arguu hin barbaanne
I couldn’t believe her	Ishee amanuu hin dandeenye
I can't believe anyone would do this	Namni kana godhu jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I want it to be different	Adda akka ta'u nan barbaada
I can't say enough about her work	Waa'ee hojii ishee gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
I can't believe this.	Kana amanuu hin danda'u.
I want him to know this	Kana akka beeku nan barbaada
I just didn’t have the space	Bakka sana qofa hin qabu ture
I didn't want it to happen	Ani akka ta'u hin barbaanne
I thought we needed some space	Bakka tokko tokko nu barbaachisa jedheen yaade
I’ve always liked it	Yeroo hundumaa natti tola ture
The one that works.	Kan hojjetu.
He has the money.	Maallaqa qaba.
I wasn’t really in the mood.	Dhuguma miira keessa hin turre.
No one is perfect.	Namni guutuu hin jiru.
Very good, but still not human.	Baayyee gaarii dha, garuu ammas nama miti.
Perhaps you are.	Tarii taʼuu dandeessa.
Now you are in trouble.	Amma rakkoo keessa jirta.
It worked better, it worked better.	Caalaatti hojjete, caalaa hojjete.
I just need to not see you	Si arguu dhiisuu qofa na barbaachisa
It's time to.	Yeroon itti...
I think he is our only hope	Abdii keenya isa qofa natti fakkaata
It should have been so different this morning.	Silaa ganama kana akkas adda ta'uu qaba ture.
I couldn't see very well.	Baayyee gaarii arguu hin dandeenye.
I just wasn't sure it was a good idea	Yaada gaarii ta'uu isaa qofa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I can't do this to them	Ani kana isaan irratti gochuu hin danda'u
He can't live without me.	Ana malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
I wasn’t going to do it though	Ani garuu gochuuf hin turre
It all seemed pretty clear.	Hundi isaa baayyee ifa ta'ee itti fakkaate.
I don’t know what was before me	Waan na dura ture hin beeku
I was a little girl.	Ani intala xiqqoo ture.
He could be a boy.	Inni gurbaa ta'uu danda'a.
I can't eat anymore	Kana booda nyaachuu hin danda'u
It wasn’t true	Dhugaa hin turre
My favorite time of year.	Yeroon waggaa keessaa baay'ee jaalladhu.
Lots of children.	Ijoollee baay'ee.
That may have been true once, but it is no longer true.	Sun yeroo tokko dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa, kana booda garuu dhugaa miti.
He realized what was at stake	Waan balaa irra jiru hubate
It seems easy.	Salphaa fakkaata.
That's what's going to happen.	Kan ta'uuf jiru kanuma.
I could be wrong.	Ani dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
In my eyes.	Ija koo keessa.
I can't be here anymore	Kana booda as jiraachuu hin danda'u
I was trying to help him	Isa gargaaruuf yaalaa ture
I'm just a little bit.	Ani xiqqoo qofa.
They.	Isaan.
But this can help in some cases.	Garuu kun haala tokko tokko keessatti gargaaruu danda’a.
You said maybe you don’t need it anymore.	Tarii kana booda si hin barbaachisu jette.
Lots and lots of food.	Nyaata baay'ee fi baay'ee.
As they have.	Akkuma qabu.
But there is nothing else here.	Garuu asitti wanti biraa hin jiru.
I can't give you an answer.	Deebii siif kennuu hin danda'u.
It could have been much worse.	Silaa baayyee hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
He would have had it.	Silaa qaba ture.
I don't know anymore.	Kana booda hin beeku.
Now that would be one thing.	Amma sun waan tokko ta'a.
But there was no one.	Namni garuu hin turre.
Not that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura miti.
I thought it would be better for you	Siif wayya jedheen yaade
He had an issue.	Inni dhimma qaba ture.
I said, maybe tomorrow	jedheen, tarii boru ta'a
We are here to help!.	Gargaaruuf as jirra!.
I have a lot of questions	Gaaffii baay'een qaba
But there is no life.	Garuu jireenya hin jiru.
A little goes a long way here	Xiqqoo asitti karaa dheeraa deema
He wasn’t quite sure why he was doing it	Maaliif akkas akka godhu sirriitti hin beeku ture
There is no one else	Namni biraa hin jiru .
I think you have that picture.	Suuraa sana waan qabdu natti fakkaata.
They must be.	Ta'uu qabu.
No one could find it.	Namni argachuu hin dandeenye.
I have to do something	Waan tokko gochuun qaba
This is obvious.	Kun ifaadha.
I hoped the time would come sooner	Yeroon dafee akka dhufu abdiin qaba ture
I wasn’t quite there for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf guutummaatti achi hin turre
This may not be the case.	Kun taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I told him a couple of things.	Tokko lama itti hime.
And it had happened again.	Ammas ta'ee ture.
But you are not the person you were.	Garuu ati nama turte sana miti.
I have nothing to do with them.	Ani isaan waliin homaa hin qabu.
He may not get another chance	Carraa biraa argachuu dhiisuu danda'a
But it wasn’t necessarily.	Garuu dirqama hin turre.
I should have found her, she said.	Silaa ishee argachuu qaba ture jette.
A big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa.
Probably a lot of it.	Tarii baay'ee ta'a.
But it clearly works for him	Garuu isaaf akka hojjetu ifaadha
None of them are with him.	Tokkollee waliin hin jiru.
I know where she is	Bakka isheen jirtu nan beeka
I had him right here	Ani sirriitti asitti isa qaba ture
I’ve been waiting for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf eegaa ture
None of them could see it.	Isaan keessaa namni tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
I know where it will be.	Eessa akka ta'u nan beeka.
A little later maybe, but not right now.	Xiqqoo booda tarii, garuu yeroo ammaa miti.
But it never works.	Gonkumaa garuu hin hojjetu.
I knew she knew me	Isheen akka na beektu nan beeka ture
I couldn’t believe what we just did up there	Waan amma achi ol hojjenne amanuu hin dandeenye
You look a lot like me.	Ati baay'ee na fakkaata.
It didn’t matter anymore	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu ture
I wondered what he was doing with all this	Kana hunda maal gochaa jira jedheen yaade
He still didn’t know when to do it.	Ammas yoom akka godhu hin beeku ture.
This, of course, cannot do.	Kun, beekamaadha, gochuu hin danda’u.
I knew what he was doing.	Waan inni hojjetu nan beeka ture.
It works on it.	Irratti hojjeta.
That's a good question.	Gaaffii gaarii dha.
I don't know you at all.	Ani tasumaa si hin beeku.
I can give them to you.	Isaan siif kennuu nan danda'a.
I wasn’t there for him	Ani isaaf hin turre
This was a good one.	Kun gaarii ture.
That was it for him.	Isaaf kanuma ture.
I was always giggling.	Yeroo hundumaa nan qoosaa ture.
I mean before all this	Kana hunda dura jechuu kooti
I wondered where he was	Eessa ture jedheen yaade
The problem is that this is not entirely accurate.	Rakkoon jiru kun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
I haven’t seen anyone in there in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf nama achi keessa jiru hin argine
I think he’s just alone	Inni kophaa isaa qofa natti fakkaata
I didn’t care for him	Ani isaaf dhimma hin qabu ture
But those were the same two.	Garuu sun lamaan tokko turan.
That may mean it, but this really, really works.	Sun jechuu danda'a, garuu kun dhuguma, dhuguma ni hojjeta.
Then you can eat it.	Sana booda nyaachuu dandeessa.
I hadn’t thought of that	Ani sana hin yaadne ture
I know all about her	Waa'ee ishee hunda nan beeka
Everyone could have known what was happening, as it turned out.	Namni hundi waan ta'aa jiru beekuu danda'a ture, akkuma ta'e.
There was no other.	Kan biraa hin turre.
He had a job to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
I really just need to know	Dhuguma beekuu qofa na barbaachisa
We were always in good shape, always.	Yeroo hundumaa haala gaarii irra turre, yeroo hundumaa.
That’s where he went.	Sana bakka inni deeme.
But it’s not mine.	Garuu kan koo miti.
He has three.	Sadii qaba.
Still no one was home.	Ammas namni mana ture hin jiru.
I think this is my biggest mistake.	Kun dogoggora koo isa guddaa natti fakkaata.
I certainly do.	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha.
I have to do something about that	Sana irratti waan tokko gochuun qaba
I know everyone here	Nama as jiru hunda nan beeka
I think that’s how he found us	Akkasitti nu argate jedheen yaada
Now is the time to do this.	Yeroon kana itti goonu amma.
Her many children.	Ijoollee ishee baay'ee.
He may be true.	Inni dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
I wasn't being a mother	Ani haadha ta'aa hin turre
But they do work.	Garuu ni hojjetu.
We had no one else to do them.	Nama biraa isaan godhu hin qabnu turre.
Not sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
That is not the same as speaking.	Sun dubbachuu wajjin tokko miti.
I still do that.	Ammallee akkas nan godha.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
I think there could have been two	Silaa lama ta'uu danda'u jedheen yaada
But none of them have any idea what that means.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee maal jechuu akka ta’e yaada xiqqoo qabu.
I am in no danger	Ani balaa tokkollee keessa hin jiru
I still knew nothing	Ammallee homaa hin beeku ture
He was a boy.	Gurbaa ture.
She was a bit more.	Isheen xiqqoo caalaa turte.
I hadn’t been there in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf achi hin deemne ture
I knew a lot of people	Namoota baay'een beeka ture
It just had something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qofa qaba ture.
It wasn’t a good place.	Bakka gaarii hin turre.
Clearly, he was not one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko akka hin taane ifa taʼe.
But he still loves food.	Garuu ammallee nyaata ni jaallata.
I was someone someone loved	Ani nama namni tokko jaallatu ture
That’s a good situation.	Sun haala gaarii dha.
She didn't want to know herself.	Ofii ishee beekuu hin barbaanne.
I think he can help me	Inni na gargaaruu danda'a jedheen yaada
I think it’s just more true.	Caalaatti dhugaa qofa natti fakkaata.
But for sure it will be here longer than anyone would like.	Garuu mirkanaa'aa ta'ee asitti yeroo dheeraa kan namni barbaadu caalaa ta'a.
I didn’t want you to know.	Akka ati beektu hin barbaanne.
He wants to do this.	Kana gochuu barbaada.
I want him alone, helpless	Kophaa isaa, gargaarsa hin qabne nan barbaada
I’m not sure if that’s possible	Sun ni danda’ama ta’uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa’aa miti
I have no idea why it exists	Maaliif akka jiru yaada hin qabu
In reality this is not so.	Dhugaa jiru keessatti kun akkas miti.
He wants to help us.	Nu gargaaruu barbaada.
I can't ask her that.	Sana ishee gaafachuu hin danda'u.
The desire to live.	Fedhii jiraachuu.
That is a very good thing.	Sun waan baayyee gaarii dha.
I love that guy.	Gurbaa sana nan jaalladha.
I really want to know the truth.	Dhugaa jiru beekuu baay'een barbaada.
He really wanted it.	Dhuguma barbaade.
I can't do this, it's not like that	Kana gochuu hin danda'u, akkas miti
Now tell me what you want.	Amma waan barbaaddu natti himi.
Maybe there's nothing in it.	Tarii wanti keessa hin jiru ta'a.
I can do that at home	Mana kootti akkas gochuu nan dandaʼa
They become waiting.	Isaan eegaa ta'u.
It would never happen.	Gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
I should never do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin qabu
You have to tell me what happened.	Waan ta'e natti himuu qabda.
That’s my only reason.	Sababni koo kana qofa.
I think it is possible	Ni danda'ama jedheen yaada
I didn’t know what to do.	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
But look at it today.	Garuu har'a ilaalaa.
He couldn’t, of course	Hin dandeenye, beekamaadha
This is the right thing to do.	Kun waan sirrii dha.
I think about everything	Waan hundumaa nan yaada
But the problem is it won't.	Garuu rakkoon jiru hin ta'u.
A lot of filling.	Guutuu baay'ee.
Except that it is necessary.	Barbaachisaa ta'uu isaa malee.
I want you inside me	Keessa kootti si barbaada
He wanted a place to go	Bakka itti deemu barbaade
We should be looking at that idea.	Yaada sana ilaalaa jiraachuu qabna.
Not a good idea.	Yaada gaarii miti.
He is here.	Inni as jira.
A lot can happen in that moment	Yeroo sanatti waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a
I love her so much	Baay'een ishee jaalladha
I knew her father.	Abbaa ishee nan beeka ture.
You don't have to come.	Dhufuu hin qabdu.
He said something.	Waan tokko jedhe.
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
It works for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hojjeta.
Someone stared at them	Namni tokko ija keessa isaan ilaale
I needed a job and I still do.	Hojii na barbaachisa ture ammas nan barbaada.
I think it should be, but it isn't	Ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada, garuu hin ta'u
Hopefully that won’t be necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa akka hin taane abdii qabna.
This could not have happened without humans.	Kun nama malee ta’uu hin danda’u ture.
It’s still in the danger zone.	Ammallee naannoo balaa keessa jira.
But you just wait.	Garuu isin qofa eegaa.
I wasn’t good with this guy	Gurbaa kana waliin gaarii hin turre
I just didn’t know what to tell him	Waan itti himu qofa hin beeku ture
I was a lucky man, a very lucky man	Ani nama carraa qabu, nama baayyee carraa qabu ture
No problems so far.	Hanga ammaatti rakkoon hin jiru.
I have another question though	Gaaffii biraa qaba garuu
I can't seem to do without her	Ishee malee waanan hojjechuu hin danda'u natti fakkaata
I know that you are.	Akka ati jirtu nan beeka.
It wasn’t that good.	Hangas gaarii hin turre.
I would love to go with you	Si waliin deemuun baay'ee natti tola
I am one of the lucky few	Ani warra carraa qaban muraasa keessaa tokko
Look at this and this issue.	Dhimma kanaa fi kana ilaalaa.
It’s the size of my arm.	Hamma harka kooti.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Ani qofa amanuu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t know anyone else was there	Namni biraa akka jiru hin beeku ture
Maybe it's nothing.	Tarii homaa miti.
I knew she had my interest	Fedhii koo akka qabdu nan beeka ture
I want to make her mine	Kan koo ishee gochuu barbaada
I didn't know why at the time.	Yeroo sanatti maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
It would have been different	Silaa adda ta'a ture
I want that for you	Ani siif akkas ta'uu barbaada
It was something.	Waan tokko ture.
I want to go alone	Kophaa koo deemuu barbaada
That would never work.	Sun gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
I didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
It’s as bright as day in here.	As keessa akka guyyaa ifaadha.
I wanted to do something different	Waan adda taʼe hojjechuu nan barbaade
I couldn’t get any sleep	Hirriba tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
Just me, alone, again.	Ana qofa, kophaa koo, ammas.
It went very well.	Baayyee gaarii deeme.
It was only two hours of sleep	Hirriba sa'aatii lama qofa ture
I didn’t really have one	Dhuguma tokko hin qabu ture
That’s really it.	Dhuguma kanuma.
But you never know when.	Garuu yoom akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beektu.
It was like living entirely in a book.	Guutummaatti kitaaba keessa jiraachuu fakkaata ture.
He still didn't know what he had done, what he had done	Ammallee maal akka hojjete, maal akka hojjete hin beeku ture
That’s not an excuse.	Sun sababa miti.
I didn’t want the money	Ani qarshii hin barbaanne
I think he should come with me	Na waliin dhufuu qaba jedheen yaada
I am going to help him	Ani isa gargaaruuf deema
You have to play.	Taphachuu qabda.
They had something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qabu turan.
I couldn't tell you how	Akkamitti akka ta'e sitti himuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t know she would	Isheen akka gootu hin beeku ture
I really really don’t want to know.	Dhuguma dhuguma beekuu hin barbaadu.
I had nothing to say on the matter	Dhimma kana irratti waanan jedhu hin qabu ture
Can't help myself though	Of gargaaruu hin danda'u garuu
I think this is the right time	Yeroon kun yeroo sirrii natti fakkaata
He stared at her for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ija keessa ishee ilaale.
You can do a lot of good.	Waan gaarii hedduu hojjechuu dandeessa.
I wasn’t looking for my place	Bakka koo barbaadaa hin turre
I know what you’re thinking.	Waan ati yaaddu nan beeka.
I don't say anything	Ani homaa hin jedhu
It just seemed right.	Sirrii qofa fakkaata ture.
It was just to be with him	Isa waliin ta'uuf qofa ture
It’s an old photo.	Suuraa durii dha.
Maybe, maybe not.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a, tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
He was very happy.	Inni baayʼee gammade.
He was wrong.	Dogoggora qaba ture.
There was nothing else you could do.	Wanti biraa ati gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
I knew he wasn’t thinking right at the time	Yeroo sanatti sirriitti akka hin yaadne nan beeka ture
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
I'm looking into it.	Ani keessa ilaalaa jira.
I wish it hadn't happened	Osoo hin taane ta'ee natti tola ture
It must be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu qaba.
No curiosity, no interest.	Fedhii beekuu hin qabu, fedhii hin qabu.
I just don’t know who.	Eenyu qofa hin beeku.
Many are still around.	Baay'een isaanii ammallee naannoo sana jiru.
I could never make myself	Ani gonkumaa of gochuu hin dandeenye
Tomorrow is a new day.	Boru guyyaa haaraa dha.
I have high hopes for him	Isaaf abdii guddaa qaba
Good and bad.	Gaarii fi hamaa.
I really can't believe he's gone	Dhuguma akka inni hin jirre amanuu hin danda'u
I saw the dress.	Uffata sana arge.
I love you very, very much	Baay'een baay'een si jaalladha
Still, there is no problem here.	Ammas yoo ta'e asitti rakkoon hin jiru.
You don't have to know.	Beekuu hin qabdu.
There was a time.	Yeroo tokko ni ture.
I can't tell.	Himuu hin danda'u.
Where he shouldn't have come	Bakka silaa dhufuu hin qabne
I think about everything	Waan hundumaa nan yaada
But now tell me something else.	Amma garuu waan biraa natti himi.
I'm working on it.	Ani irratti hojjechaa jira.
I didn't realize you were in today	Har'a keessa akka jirtu hin hubanne
You don’t like that.	Sana hin jaallattu.
I was three years old.	Umuriin koo waggaa sadii ture.
A day walker, different in my opinion	Nama guyyaa deemu, akka kootti adda
Without being.	Osoo hin taane.
That, of course, is just not true.	Sun, beekamaadha, dhugaa miti qofa.
But this is really different from the issue at hand.	Garuu kun dhuguma dhimma harka jiru irraa adda.
That's when it happens.	Yeroo sanatti ta'a.
I saw nothing on the road	Karaa irratti homaa hin argine
What happened was terrible.	Wanti ta'e hamaa ture.
I just can’t seem to help it.	Ani waanan gargaaruu hin dandeenye qofa natti fakkaata.
I have a lot to say about that book.	Waa'ee kitaaba sanaa waan baay'ee jedhu qaba.
I didn't really know what it was	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku ture
It looked like one big joke.	Qoosaa guddaa tokko fakkaata ture.
There is never any.	Gonkumaa hin jiru.
I love photography of everyday life	Suuraa jireenya guyyaa guyyaa baay'een jaalladha
I can get them both	Isaan lamaan argachuu danda'a
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii dha.
I’m working on a new book	Kitaaba haaraa irratti hojjechaa jira
I walked right out of my house	Anis sirriitti mana koo keessaa ba'e
I wanted to tell him it wasn’t true	Dhugaa akka hin taane itti himuu barbaade
They must be true.	Isaan dhugaa ta’uu qabu.
About us.	Waa'ee keenya.
I knew she wanted me to be good	Akkan gaarii ta'u akkan barbaaddu nan beeka ture
Let me make it simple.	Mee salphaa akkan godhu.
I knew they weren’t up to any good	Isaan hanga gaarii tokkollee akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
I know it’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
They just come.	Isaan qofa dhufu.
I shouldn’t have made an exception for this job	Silaa hojii kanaaf ala gochuu hin qabu ture
We have no place anymore.	Kana booda bakka hin qabnu.
You’re here, you’re there.	Ati as jirta, achi jira.
I just don’t meet people like that.	Namoota akkasii waliin wal hin argine qofa.
But I don’t do it anymore.	Garuu kana booda hin godhu.
They had no one else.	Nama biraa hin qaban turan.
I didn’t see her all day	Guyyaa guutuu ishee hin argine
I thought I thought it	Natti fakkaate natti fakkaate
You don't do anything.	Homaa hin gootu.
This was not such a good thing.	Kun akkas waan gaarii hin turre.
I think she was waiting for me	Isheen na eegaa turte jedheen yaada
It just can't be you.	Si ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
I mean, I didn’t see him	Isa hin argine jechuu kooti
But not entirely outside.	Garuu guutummaatti ala miti.
So, even, it has their names.	Kanaaf, illee, maqaa isaanii qaba.
But sometimes they would come.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko ni dhufu turan.
Just look at his location.	Bakka isaa qofa ilaalaa.
If that was even a thing.	Osoo sun illee waan tokko ta'ee.
We still have time.	Ammallee yeroo qabna.
I always thought that would be the case	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'a jedheen yaade
I don’t do it.	Hin godhu.
These are no longer children.	Kun kana booda ijoollee miti.
Time was nothing but work.	Yeroon hojii malee homaa hin turre.
So going over those.	Kanaaf warra sana irra deemuu.
He is sure of it.	Inni mirkanaa'aa dha.
I don’t have that feeling this year	Bara kana miira akkasii hin qabu
No one wants you here.	Namni asitti si barbaadu hin jiru.
I knew what it was like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture
She was there today.	Har'a achi turte.
Great stuff, just today	Waan guddaa, har'a qofa
I'm still waiting for your name	Ammallee maqaa kee eegaa jira
Thus, for him.	Akkasitti, isaaf.
Now this was twice in one week.	Amma kun torban tokko keessatti yeroo lama ture.
It was after two things.	Waan lama booda ture.
There was no need to do it.	Gochuun hin barbaachisu ture.
In this lifetime.	Jireenya kana keessatti.
I needed it at home	Mana keessatti na barbaachisa ture
It was that good.	Akkasitti gaarii ture.
Without him, many of us were already too big.	Isa malee baay'een keenya duruu baayyee guddaa turre.
That is the reality.	Wanti dhugaa jiru kanuma.
I can't really comment	Dhuguma yaada kennuu hin danda'u
I didn’t know the exact time	Yeroo sirriitti hin beeku ture
I didn't want to ask him that	Ani akkas jedhee isa gaafachuu hin barbaanne
I know them.	Ani isaan beeka.
Please wait for me.	Mee na eegaa.
We don't do it	Hin goonu .
They are here to stay.	Isaan turuuf as jiru.
glad it wasn’t just me.	ana qofa akka hin taane gammadeera.
It really does.	Dhuguma ni godha.
I just need time	Yeroo qofa na barbaachisa
But there's a lot going on.	Garuu waan baay'een ta'aa jira.
It wasn’t true! 	Dhugaa hin turre!
he told himself.	jedhee ofitti hime.
But she didn't know.	Garuu hin beektu turte.
I wondered what that even meant	Sun illee maal jechuu akka taʼe nan yaade
But he made one tiny little mistake.	Garuu dogoggora xiqqoo xiqqoo tokko hojjete.
Good job guys.	Hojii gaarii gurbaa.
When you do, I can't go wrong.	Yeroo gootu dogoggora deemuu hin danda'u.
To some extent	Hamma tokko
Maybe that will help you.	Tarii sun si gargaaruu dandaʼa taʼa.
Like, really, really good.	Akka, dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii.
He has three.	Sadii qaba.
I couldn’t get any answers	Deebii tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
He was a completely different person, a new person.	Nama guutummaatti adda ta'e, nama haaraa ture.
It will be an easy book.	Kitaaba salphaa ta'a.
I am alone here most of the time	Yeroo baayyee asitti kophaa koo jira
I am not perfect.	Ani guutuu miti.
That’s a mistake.	Sun dogoggora.
I hesitated a little	Xiqqoo duubatti jedheen
She is not at home.	Mana hin jirtu.
Perhaps this is the time of the.	Tarii kun yeroo kan...
I really can't live without it.	Dhuguma isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
It won't happen again.	Ammas hin ta'u.
Not that it really matters.	Dhuguma dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
There are many things you can do to help your situation.	Haala keessa jirtu gargaaruuf wantoota hedduu gochuu dandeessa.
I think he likes her	Ishee waan jaallatu natti fakkaata
She didn’t know his name.	Maqaa isaa hin beektu turte.
I had nothing to say to her.	Waan isheen jedhu hin qabu ture.
I don't think I'm funny at all.	Ani tasumaa nama qoosaa ta'ee natti hin fakkaatu.
I can't do this alone	Kana kophaa koo gochuu hin danda'u
I think that will always stay with me	Sun yeroo hundumaa na bira jiraata jedheen yaada
I think you still care	Ammallee siif yaaddu natti fakkaata
But he can't.	Garuu hin danda'u.
I don’t think this is a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii natti hin fakkaatu.
I know he can do better	Kana caalaa hojjechuu akka danda'u nan beeka
He wasn't here when it happened.	Yeroo ta'u as hin turre.
I don’t want to give that up.	Sana dhiisuu hin barbaadu.
His was much worse than mine.	Kan isaa kan koo caalaa baayyee hamaa ture.
Maybe it's just always different.	Tarii yeroo hundumaa adda ta'uu qofa ta'a.
I wondered what he really thought	Dhuguma maal yaade jedheen yaade
That's how it was.	Akkas ta'ee ture.
Except sometimes, they can.	Yeroo tokko tokko malee, ni danda’u.
It didn’t work for me.	Naaf hin hojjenne.
I couldn’t know the answer	Deebii isaa beekuu hin dandeenye
I know he wants to help	Gargaaruu akka barbaadu nan beeka
He got the terrible truth.	Inni dhugaa hamaa argate.
That seems obvious.	Sun ifa fakkaata.
I have been trying all of this for the past month.	Ji'a darbe kana hunda yaalaa ture.
Sometimes I do that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas nan godha.
But then he favors us even more.	Sana booda garuu caalaatti tola nuuf godha.
The work itself was more important.	Hojiin ofii isaa caalaa barbaachisaa ture.
You want something.	Ati waan tokko barbaaddu jira.
He wanted an answer.	Deebii barbaade.
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
I had no idea what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Look at your house.	Mana keessan ilaalaa.
Maybe he would have been one of them.	Tarii silaa isaan keessaa tokko ta'a ture.
But that’s not entirely accurate.	Garuu sun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
That didn’t happen here.	Asitti sun hin taane.
But not now.	Garuu amma miti.
But I didn't know.	Ani garuu hin beeku ture.
I can't believe it otherwise	Kana malee amanuu hin danda'u
That would be much easier.	Sun baayyee salphaa ta'a.
Something has to give.	Waan tokko kennuu qaba.
You were the one who had to find her.	Ishee argachuu kan qabdu si ture.
It didn’t seem to work for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf waan hojjete hin fakkaatu ture.
You know who you are.	Eenyu akka taate ni beekta.
Then there is language.	Sana booda afaan jira.
I want some alone time with you	Yeroo muraasa kophaa koo si waliin barbaada
He may come back later	Booda deebi'uu danda'a
She doesn't have a little bit.	Xiqqoo hin qabdu.
I looked at the watch on my wrist.	Sa'aatii harka koo irra jiru ilaale.
I didn't think of anything else	Waan biraa hin yaadne
They did, and they still do.	Gochaa turan, ammas ni hojjetu.
I still have some time	Ammallee yeroo muraasa qaba
Can't say more about it	Kana caalaa waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
That this is no longer the case.	Kana booda akkas akka hin taane.
He said he didn't know much about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beeku jedhe.
I can get it most of the time	Yeroo baayyee argachuu nan danda'a
He said he didn't want one.	Tokko hin barbaadu jedhe.
You know your work.	Hojii keessan ni beektu.
I don’t know anyone anymore	Kana booda nama tokkollee hin beeku
That was something she had to do.	Sun waan isheen gochuu qabdu ture.
I won't be a problem	Ani rakkoo hin ta'u
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
I know you are looking somewhere	Bakka tokko akka ilaalaa jirtu nan beeka
That meant nothing.	Jechuun homaa jechuu hin turre.
I have no demands on the wife.	Haadha manaa irraa gaaffii hin qabu.
I told him there was no one up there	Anis achi ol namni tokkollee akka hin jirre itti hime
I can totally be myself.	Ani guutummaatti ofii koo ta'uu nan danda'a.
I just didn’t know how to tell you	Akkamitti akkan sitti himu qofa hin beeku ture
I can't say enough good things about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
He probably will be.	Inni tarii ni ta'a.
Look for Him!.	Isa barbaadaa!.
The afternoon before the accident.	Balaa kanaan dura waaree booda.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
She was still a novice.	Ammallee nama haaraa turte.
I don't know, but it could happen.	Hin beeku, garuu ta'uu danda'a.
I want to be very clear, here.	Baayyee ifa ta'uu barbaada, asitti.
I’m just doing my job.	Hojii koo qofa hojjechaa jira.
We can’t do anything tonight.	Halkan kana homaa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
They want evil.	Hamaa barbaadu.
I know who you are.	Eenyu akka taate nan beeka.
Sometimes, they have good intentions.	Yeroo tokko tokko, yaada gaarii qabu.
I want him now.	Amma isa barbaada.
Who knows that could happen.	Eenyutu beeka sun ta'uu danda'a.
He had no job and no hope	Hojii fi abdii hin qabu ture
He needed that.	Sana isa barbaachisa ture.
I've never been funny	Ani nama qoosaa ta'ee hin beeku
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Kana irratti namni na gargaaru jiraa ?.
After something.	Waan tokko booda.
Without him.	Isa malee.
I knew those things about her	Waa'ee ishee wantoota sana nan beeka ture
He says it again.	Ammas akkas jedha.
We have them, lots of them.	Isaan ni qabna, baay’een isaanii.
I used to love this place	Duraan bakka kana baay'een jaalladha ture
I didn't know much.	Waan baay'ee hin beeku ture.
He didn’t know how to like it.	Akkamitti akka jaallatu hin beeku ture.
I have no idea about doing it.	Ani waa'ee hojjechuuf yaada hin qabu.
I didn’t know you liked them	Akka isaan jaallattu hin beeku ture
I love her so much.	Baay'een ishee jaalladha.
The truth about where he went, what he did while he was there.	Dhugaa bakka inni deeme, yeroo achi ture maal akka hojjete.
This is not correct in this case.	Kun haala kana keessatti sirrii miti.
I think that's pretty good	Sun baayyee gaarii natti fakkaata
You need it.	Ati si barbaachisa.
I can almost see that one	Isa sana arguu nan danda'a jechuun ni danda'ama
I saw it work night after night	Halkan halkan akka hojjetu arge
I hope not too much	Baay'ee akka hin taane abdiin qaba
Maybe that's what it is.	Tarii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
I had no other books	Kitaaba biraa hin qabu ture
I think he really meant what he said	Dhuguma waan jedhe jechuu isaa natti fakkaata
That was the problem.	Rakkoon ture kanuma ture.
He wants the answer now	Deebii isaa amma barbaada
It was just too much.	Garmalee qofa ture.
It really should be.	Dhuguma ta'uu qaba.
Sometimes that happens now.	Yeroo tokko tokko amma akkas taʼa.
A few hours ago.	Sa'aatii muraasa dura.
I know what she can do	Waan isheen gochuu dandeessu nan beeka
Not with him.	Isa waliin miti.
This time, it worked.	Yeroo kana, hojjete.
But otherwise, it was just the two of them.	Garuu yoo kana hin taane, isaan lamaan qofa turan.
If we are.	Yoo nuti.
No one knows that better than he does.	Sana isa caalaa namni beeku hin jiru.
He had something else to do, he wasn’t going	Waan biraa hojjechuu qaba ture, hin deemu ture
That’s how that works then.	Yeroo sanatti sun akkasitti hojjeta.
They didn’t have any time.	Yeroo tokkollee hin qaban turan.
Now, it seemed inappropriate.	Amma, waan sirrii hin taane fakkaata ture.
No one knows anything.	Namni homaa beeku hin jiru.
I know him very well.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka.
It was very, very different.	Baayyee baayyee adda ture.
I said the same thing to her	Anis kanuma isheen jedhe
It’s not like you do it.	Akka ati gootu miti.
He was more than alone.	Kophaa isaa caalaa ture.
I think you have good language.	Afaan gaarii qabda jedheen yaada.
He had high hopes for us	Abdii guddaa nuuf qaba ture
He was right, of course.	Inni sirrii akka ture beekamaadha.
A month later he left	Ji'a tokko booda deeme
I hope it all went well	Hundi isaa akka gaariitti akka deeme abdiin qaba
Not good, not bad.	Gaarii miti, hamaa miti.
But she needs to know better.	Garuu caalaatti beekuu qabdi.
Then it worked well.	Sana booda akka gaariitti hojjete.
The best part of the day.	Kutaa guyyaa keessaa isa gaarii.
Something else entirely.	Guutummaatti waan biraa.
Just like us.	Akkuma keenya.
Clearly, she did.	Akka goote ifaadha.
I can't talk about it right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
Where you go.	Bakka ati deemtu.
Didn't do much of anything this morning	Ganama kana homaa baay'ee hin hojjenne
He rarely had to, mostly.	Inni yeroo muraasaaf dirqama qaba ture, irra caalaa.
Love seeing him.	Isa arguu jaalladhu.
Sorry, but I can't.	Dhiifama garuu hin danda'u.
I know now that he wants this for me	Kana akka naaf barbaadu amma beeka
No one else knew.	Namni biraa hin beeku ture.
That was a very dangerous thing to do.	Sun waan baayʼee balaa qabu ture.
But you never know what will happen.	Garuu waan ta'u gonkumaa hin beektu.
I think you have a good thing going here	Waan gaarii as deemaa jirtu natti fakkaata
I can't find her.	Ishee argachuu hin danda'u.
I couldn’t see living my life without her.	Ishee malee jireenya koo jiraachuu arguu hin dandeenye.
It was something that happened.	Waan ta'e ture.
This may not be true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I knew he wouldn’t be here long	Yeroo dheeraa akka as hin turre nan beeka ture
I don't know what exactly the timing will be	Yeroon isaa sirriitti maal akka ta'u hin beeku
I know you know what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru akka beektu nan beeka
We hadn’t thought of a name.	Maqaa hin yaadne turre.
He didn’t have that joke.	Qoosaa sana hin qabu ture.
I wonder how old she must be.	Umuriin ishee meeqa akka ta'u nan yaada.
I think that’s important.	Sun barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
But it became what it was.	Garuu waan ta'e ta'e.
I couldn’t find him, he couldn’t find me	Ani isa argachuu hin dandeenye, inni na argachuu hin dandeenye
I love it here	Asitti baay'een jaalladha
That might be what you want.	Wanti ati barbaaddu sun taʼuu dandaʼa.
If it works.	Yoo hojjete.
I didn’t want to be in school	Mana barumsaa jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I think we should stay here	As turuu qabna jedheen yaada
I knew the idea of ​​what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada beeka ture.
A couple of questions.	Gaaffii tokko lama.
I always thought that	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedheen yaada ture
I wanted to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu barbaade.
So it seems like a good thing.	Kanaaf waan gaarii fakkaata.
I know exactly what happened	Waan ta'e sirriitti beeka
She didn’t know without hope.	Abdii malee hin beektu turte.
I'm not feeling good about this area	Ani waa'ee naannoo kanaa miira gaarii hin qabu
I’m looking for a way to go.	Karaa tokko irra deemuu barbaadaa jira.
She holds his hand.	Harka isaa qabdi.
He was a different dog there.	Inni achitti saree adda ta'e ture.
They know where you are.	Bakka jirtu ni beeku.
I don’t think I do	Ani waan godhu natti hin fakkaatu
It will be very good for you.	Baayyee gaarii siif ta'a.
I have a good feeling about you	Waa'ee kee miira gaarii qaba
That would have been a long time ago.	Silaa sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
You’re like me.	Ati akka kooti.
I have no ill will towards them	Ani isaan irratti yaada hamaa hin qabu
There are some problems.	Rakkoon tokko tokko jira.
I could live without it.	Isa malee jiraachuu nan danda'a ture.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
Not everyone likes it.	Namni hundi hin jaallatu.
Said.	Jedhe.
He just couldn't.	Hin dandeenye qofa.
It wasn’t right.	Sirrii hin turre.
I think they should be different	Adda ta'uu qabu jedheen yaada
I wondered who it could be	Eenyu ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
You can go.	Deemu dandeessa.
As you go, you have a good idea.	Akkuma deemtu yaada gaarii qabda.
I knew what he could do	Waan inni gochuu dandaʼu nan beeka ture
I didn’t want to do that	Ani akkas gochuuf hin barbaanne
But nothing is coming.	Garuu wanti dhufu hin jiru.
There was the problem.	Rakkoon achi ture.
I had no idea how.	Akkamitti akka ta'u yaada hin qabu ture.
He was very important to us.	Inni nuuf baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
I don't know what to do	Waan godhu hin beeku
I thought about it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf jedheen yaade.
I know you care about me	Akka na yaaddu nan beeka
It was a shoe.	Kophee ture.
I don’t know how to help her.	Akkamitti akkan ishee gargaaru hin beeku.
Then something goes wrong.	Sana booda wanti tokko dogoggora ta'a.
We were inside.	Keessa turre.
After a while he was gone.	Yeroo muraasa booda hin turre.
A simple name for a simple person	Maqaa salphaa nama salphaa
That seems to be what happened here.	Asitti kan ta'e kanuma fakkaata.
I don’t love myself.	Of hin jaalladhu.
There could never be another like her, she said.	Kan akka ishee kan biraa gonkumaa jiraachuu hin danda'u jette.
I really enjoyed this episode	Kutaa kana baay'een gammade
That's what I mean.	Akkas jechuu kooti.
I won’t do it anymore	Kana booda hin godhu
But, both have obvious issues.	Garuu, lamaan isaanii dhimma ifa ta’e qabu.
But with everything else, maybe he doesn't need it.	Garuu waan biraa hundumaa wajjin tarii isa hin barbaachisu ta'a.
Fortunately, the eyes quickly looked up	Akka carraa ta'ee ija dafee ol ilaale
A good person, as she said	Nama gaarii, akkuma isheen jette
It never works.	Gonkumaa hin hojjetu.
I usually say that's not the case	Yeroo baay'ee akkas miti jedha
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
You are my everything.	Ati waan hundumaa kooti.
No one has done it like him.	Namni akka isaa hojjete hin jiru.
He still didn’t have a job	Ammallee hojii hin qabu ture
They have no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban.
They may not be.	Taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼu.
He had a job.	Hojii qaba ture.
I think you should meet her	Ishee waliin wal arguu qabdu jedheen yaada
But you can’t live for him.	Garuu isaaf jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
He is a good man.	Inni nama gaarii dha.
It was a really good night for us	Dhuguma halkan gaarii nuuf ture
At all risks, really.	Balaa hundumaa irratti, dhuguma.
But look at it.	Garuu ilaalaa.
There is an exception.	Kan kanaan ala ta'e garuu jira.
There was no night there.	Bakka sanatti halkan hin turre.
I was in the room looking at the door	Kutaa keessa balbala ilaalaa ture
I wasn’t always so lucky	Yeroo hundumaa akkas carraa hin qabu ture
He told me what he needed.	Waan isa barbaachisu natti hime.
This is certainly not the case.	Kun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
This is something new.	Kun waan haaraa dha.
This could be her issue in a few weeks.	Kun torban muraasa booda dhimma ishee ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't want to be that person	Ani nama sana ta'uu hin barbaanne
I didn't know something like that would happen	Waan akkasii akka ta'u hin beeku ture
Wait a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf eegaa.
I was sure no one knew much about him	Namni waa'ee isaa baay'ee beeku akka hin jirre mirkanaa'aa ture
He couldn’t make a mistake	Dogoggora hojjechuu hin dandeenye
It shouldn't have been like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I couldn’t believe this	Kana amanuu hin dandeenye
He was waiting for his time.	Yeroo isaa eegaa ture.
It didn’t do anything for me.	Homaa naaf hin goone.
This isn’t him.	Kun isa miti.
I could never satisfy this demand.	Gaaffii kana gonkumaa guutuu hin dandeenye.
Look like me.	Ana fakkaataa.
I don’t know that girl	Intala sana hin beeku
It was in his voice.	Sagalee isaa keessa ture.
Not everyone can do that.	Namni hundi akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
So, a lot of it.	Kanaaf, baay'ee.
It can help.	Gargaaruu danda'a.
It seems so obvious now.	Amma akkas ifa fakkaata.
They are doing a lot of things wrong.	Waan baay'ee dogoggora hojjechaa jiru.
I hoped he wouldn’t	Akkas akka hin goone abdiin qaba ture
It took me a lot of time to do it.	Hojjechuuf yeroo baayyee natti fudhate.
It didn’t do too well.	Garmalee gaarii hin hojjenne.
This is obviously a different situation.	Kun haala adda ta’e akka ta’e beekamaadha.
I would say about three years	Gara waggaa sadii nan jedha
I can do better than that	Kana caalaa hojjechuu nan danda'a
It didn't work very often.	Yeroo baayyee hin hojjenne.
He shouldn’t have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture
It could be worse.	Kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
I wonder why he was here	Maaliif as ture jedheen yaada
I already said sorry	Duraan dhiifama jedheen ture
I intend to go tomorrow	Boru deemuuf yaada qaba
I am going to make this clear.	Kana ifa gochuuf jira.
She won't go again.	Ammas hin deemtu.
He should have done that much.	Silaa hanga sana gochuu qaba ture.
Nobody likes that.	Namni akkas jaallatu hin jiru.
It wasn't much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee hin turre.
I didn’t want to have this feeling	Miira kana qabaachuu hin barbaanne
Something with some real life to it.	Waan jireenya dhugaa tokko tokko qabu gara isaatti.
Right on me.	Sirriitti na irra.
They just want something to work.	Wanti tokko akka hojjetu qofa barbaadu.
They were good for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf gaarii turan.
I was a good teacher.	Ani barsiisaa gaarii ture.
I really think she’s sorry	Dhuguma isheen dhiifama natti fakkaata
Even with my friends, I like to get my work done quickly.	Hiriyyoota koo wajjin illee dafee hojii koo hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
That’s what’s important.	Kan barbaachisaa ta’e kanuma.
I shouldn’t be here at all, really	Ani tasumaa as jiraachuu hin qabu, dhuguma
I didn’t have the answer in my hand	Deebii harka kootti hin qabu ture
We went though.	Deemne garuu.
Just him and his wife.	Isaa fi haadha manaa isaa qofa.
He is no different.	Inni adda miti.
But he had it in him.	Garuu of keessaa qaba ture.
He shouldn’t have done anything at all	Silaa tasumaa homaa gochuu hin qabu ture
Again, not the best part of the day.	Ammas, guyyaa keessaa isa gaarii miti.
I really, really do.	Dhuguma, dhuguma nan godha.
I didn’t know from what	Maal irraa hin beeku ture
I didn’t see you there	Achitti si hin argine
I thought it was you.	Ati akka taate natti fakkaate.
But they have one thing in common.	Garuu waan wal fakkaatu tokko qabu.
I won’t tell you what to do.	Waan gootu sitti hin himu.
That’s the whole problem.	Rakkoon jiru hundi kanuma.
I couldn't find much about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee argachuu hin dandeenye.
I obviously want to know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu akkan barbaadu ifaadha.
I wanted someone else to work with him	Namni biraa akka isa waliin hojjetu nan barbaada ture
I didn't tell him but that's what happened	Ani itti hin himne garuu akkas ta'e
No problems so far.	Hanga ammaatti rakkoon hin jiru.
They didn’t have these.	Isaan kun hin qaban turan.
Someone who went the right way.	Nama karaa sirrii irra deeme.
That was often the case.	Yeroo baayyee akkas ture.
I couldn’t do that to her	Ani akkas ishee gochuu hin dandeenye
We stayed here long enough.	Yeroo dheeraa gahaa as turre.
He knows this.	Kana ni beeka.
It worked very, very well.	Baayyee baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjete.
I thought that would be great	Sun waan guddaa ta'a jedheen yaade
He really had it.	Dhuguma qaba ture.
It wasn’t loud.	Sagalee guddaa hin qabu ture.
I saw it shortly after that.	Sana booda yeroo muraasa booda arge.
I could tell him later	Booda itti himuu nan danda'a ture
He didn’t even have a job	Hojii illee hin qabu ture
Not yet, he thought.	Ammallee miti jedhee yaade.
He has to go.	Deemu qaba.
But it’s not like me.	Garuu akka koo miti.
I knew my very large house well	Mana koo isa baayʼee guddaa taʼe sirriitti beeka ture
Now she has to go home.	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu qabdi.
I have a bad feeling about it.	Waa'ee kanaa miira hamaa qaba.
The dog, of course.	Saree, beekamaadha.
It looks a lot like him.	Baayyee isa fakkaata.
This was not always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa kun hin turre.
I wondered what he had up his sleeve	Maal harka isaa ol qaba jedheen yaade
He thought of his wife	Haadha manaa isaa yaade
I have no idea where	Eessa akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
I didn't think it would happen but it really does	Ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne garuu dhuguma ni jira
I wondered who it must be	Eenyu ta'uu qaba jedheen yaade
I am now in your hands	Ani amma harka keessan jira
I said it was fine	Anis gaarii dha jedheen
It was just a bit of luck	Xiqqoo carraa qofa ture
I want that time to be special	Yeroon sun adda akka ta'u nan barbaada
I think they would want that.	Isaan akkas ni barbaadu jedheen yaada.
It doesn't matter though.	Dhimma hin qabu garuu.
He says he better go now.	Amma deemuu wayya jedha.
I wasn't sure it was true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
We are always in it.	Yoom iyyuu keessa jirra.
He really should know	Dhuguma beekuu qaba
You must come in full tomorrow.	Boru guutummaatti dhufuu qabda.
He thought he could stay	Turuu nan danda'a jedhee yaade
That everything came from nothing.	Wanti hundi homaa irraa akka dhufe.
But this time was different.	Yeroon kun garuu adda ture.
There was nothing else.	Wanti biraa hin turre.
Not much, but it's home.	Baay'ee miti, garuu mana dha.
We hope all is well.	Hundi akka gaariitti abdii qabna.
He wanted to know her	Ishee beekuu barbaade
Then nothing happens.	Sana booda wanti ta'u hin jiru.
We were in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa turre.
But for this and then.	Garuu kanaaf fi sana booda.
Throughout the year.	Waggaa guutuu.
Would, if it were me	Silaa, osoo ana ta'ee
But then, it was none of his business.	Garuu sana booda, dhimma isaa hin turre.
There was even a chance he would do it again.	Carraan inni ammas akka godhu illee ture.
I can do one better for you	Tokko kana caalaa siif gochuu nan danda'a
What he did then, he’s doing again, now.	Waan yeroo sana godhe, ammas hojjechaa jira, amma.
I hope we can be friends	Hiriyyoota ta'uu akka dandeenyu abdiin qaba
He says nothing happened.	Homaa hin taane jedha.
It quickly became great	Dafee guddaa ta'e
Then he did it again.	Sana booda ammas godhe.
Those he could do nothing about.	Warra inni homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
Often, they do everything but not each other.	Yeroo baayyee, waan hunda ni hojjetu malee wal hin hojjetu.
I know you have to do this alone	Kana kophaa kee gochuu akka qabdu nan beeka
Perhaps he was optimistic.	Tarii abdii guddaa qaba ture.
All of them.	Hundi ana.
I couldn't believe this was actually happening	Kun dhuguma ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
I don't know what it is, exactly.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku, sirriitti.
I think they’re going to do it soon	Yeroo dhiyootti hojjechuuf jiru jedheen yaada
But you have to know the facts.	Garuu dhugaa jiru beekuu qabda.
He was a bad man.	Nama hamaa ture.
I don’t, obviously.	Ani garuu hin qabu, ifaadha.
I love that so much about you	Waa'ee kee akkas baay'een jaalladha
I knew something was wrong	Waan tokko akka taʼe nan beeka ture
You know that feeling.	Miira sana ni beekta.
I already have my answer	Deebii koo duruu qaba
I like it	Natti tola
I know this will quickly become known to you	Kun dafee akka isin beektu nan beeka
You don't know the place.	Bakka sana hin beektu.
Good night.	Halkan gaarii.
But they were not easy.	Isaan garuu salphaa hin turre.
They have two mothers.	Haadha lama qabu.
I saw that happening	Wanti sun ta'aa jiru arge
It was everything to him.	Isaaf waan hundumaa ture.
But not as much as you might think.	Garuu hamma ati yaaddu miti.
Then he does nothing.	Sana booda homaa hin godhu.
I was a bad guy	Ani nama hamaa ture
Someone who wants to find his way home	Nama karaa mana isaa argachuu barbaadu
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
Money, money, money.	Maallaqa, maallaqa, maallaqa.
I can't tell him to go home	Gara manaatti deebi'uu itti himuu hin danda'u
I’m doing you a favor	Tola siif gochaa jira
The problem was too big and widespread.	Rakkoon jiru garmalee guddaa fi bal’aa ture.
It has a lot more going for it	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee deemuu qaba
He needs a door.	Balbala barbaada.
I had a feeling it might be something like that.	Miira waan akkasii ta'uu danda'a jedheen ture.
I mean, he has everything.	Waan hundumaa qaba jechuu kooti.
The past means nothing.	Kan darbe jechuun homaa jechuu miti.
You are right.	Ati sirrii dha.
I know what you’re thinking	Waan ati yaaddu nan beeka
He is certainly on his way to it.	Gara isaatti karaa irra akka jiru beekamaadha.
I knew a girl who did this	Intala kana goote nan beeka ture
I couldn’t believe what I just saw	Waan amma arge amanuu hin dandeenye
He started again.	Ammas jalqabe.
Now, none of this will be easy.	Amma, kun tokkollee salphaa hin ta’u.
Why is it	Maaliif .
It might even work.	Illee hojjechuu danda'a.
That’s how they like to play.	Akkasitti taphachuu ni jaallatu.
I don’t have a good answer for you	Deebii gaarii siif hin qabu
It would have been more specific	Silaa caalaatti adda ta'a ture
He came again.	Ammas dhufe.
Someone we can live with	Nama waliin jiraachuu dandeenyu
I hope nothing happened	Wanti ta'e akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
Again, he could not do this	Ammas kana gochuu hin dandeenye
Maybe they should have stayed together.	Tarii silaa waliin turuu qabu turan.
That's an idea.	Sun yaada.
I thought things would be different	Wanti adda taʼa jedheen yaade ture
Maybe, maybe not.	Tarii, tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
No one needed to know.	Namni beekuu hin barbaachifne.
I didn’t know at all	Ani tasumaa hin beeku ture
It was much bigger than a dog.	Saree caalaa baayyee guddaa ture.
You can’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeessu.
I just couldn’t live with her	Ishee waliin jiraachuu qofa hin dandeenye
Maybe you never saw it.	Tarii tasumaa hin argine ta'a.
Check your answers.	Deebii keessan ilaalaa.
Everything is in hand.	Hundi harka jiru.
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
I think that’s a good thing	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaata
It wasn’t like that before.	Duraan akkas hin turre.
I thought we were great together	Waliin guddaa taane natti fakkaate
I don’t know what that was	Sun maal akka ture hin beeku
I knew it would never work	Yoomiyyuu akka hin hojjenne nan beeka ture
Home, they didn’t have it.	Mana, isaan hin qaban turan.
I cannot help you with this	Kanaan isin gargaaruu hin danda'u
I think it could have been	Ta'uu danda'a ture jedheen yaada
It can't last long, though.	Yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u garuu.
I really have no idea how	Dhuguma akkamitti akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
Like you just have to give up.	Akkuma harka kennuu qofa qabdu.
I told him what we had seen	Waan argine itti hime
He's not there tonight.	Halkan kana hin jiru.
You never go home, not really.	Ati gonkumaa gara manaatti hin deemtu, dhuguma miti.
I didn’t really know anyone else that well	Dhuguma nama biraa akkas sirriitti hin beeku ture
I doubt you can	Akka ati dandeessu nan shakka
I had no idea he could do something like that.	Waan akkasii hojjechuu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu ture.
Not sure what is happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru mirkanaa'aa miti.
Who would say such a thing.	Eenyutu waan akkasii jedha.
I am a lonely parent	Ani warra kophaa kooti
I want my house.	Mana koo barbaada.
You have a way with him.	Isa waliin karaa qabda.
So many of them.	Kanaaf baay'ee isaanii.
I wouldn’t know you existed	Silaa akka ati jirtu hin beeku
No luck and no kids around.	Carraa fi ijoollee naannoo hin jiru.
But we have work to do.	Garuu hojii qabna.
In this way, in this way.	Haala kanaan, karaa kanaan.
No one has ever been good to me but you.	Si malee namni naaf gaarii ta'ee hin beeku.
Perhaps he did not speak at all.	Tarii tasumaa hin dubbanne taʼa.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
I am not important.	Ani barbaachisaa miti.
He had to tell her.	Itti himuu qaba ture.
But it wasn’t my business.	Garuu dhimma koo hin turre.
We had a long drive.	Konkolaataa dheeraa qabna turre.
I looked up the road	Anis karaa sana ol ilaale
Being, he's here.	Ta'uu, inni as jira.
You are never home.	Ati gonkumaa mana hin jirtu.
I’m not saying any of this is wrong.	Kana keessaa tokkollee dogoggora jechuu koo miti.
I want someone to help me with them	Nama isaan waliin na gargaaru nan barbaada
They don’t have it.	Hin qaban.
But everything is fine.	Garuu wanti hundi gaarii dha.
I want him to be looking at me	Akka inni na ilaalaa jiru nan barbaada
I couldn't stay there	Achi turuu hin dandeenye
But this time you didn’t even need eyes.	Garuu yeroo kana ija illee hin barbaachifne.
You are an important person.	Ati nama barbaachisaa dha.
That seemed a bit much.	Sun xiqqoo waan baay'ee fakkaata ture.
I told him my situation	Haala koo itti hime
I said you are with her	Ishee waliin jirta jedheen
This is really nice.	Kun dhuguma namatti tola.
That's what's important.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma.
It used to be a big problem.	Duraan rakkoo guddaa ture.
But she just wasn't sure.	Garuu isheen mirkanaa'aa hin turre qofa.
Your problem is our problem.	Rakkoon keessan rakkoo keenya.
I mean, it was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture jechuu kooti.
Please look at my picture.	Mee suuraa koo ilaalaa.
Obviously that wasn’t true.	Sun dhugaa akka hin turre ifaadha.
It happens in a moment.	Yeroo muraasa keessatti ta'a.
This can all happen in about a day	Kun hundi gara guyyaa tokko keessatti ta’uu danda’a
We have no idea what is going on.	Waan deemaa jiru yaada hin qabnu.
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
I can give you everything here	Waan hundumaa asitti siif kennuu nan danda'a
He knew he wasn't thinking right.	Sirriitti akka hin yaadne ni beeka ture.
I did not know how to handle the situation	Haala sana akkamitti akkan dandaʼu hin beeku ture
I mean other than me	Ana malee kan biraa jechuu kooti
Then we were a lot.	Sana booda baay'ee turre.
It must be bad for you.	Siif hamaa ta'uu qaba.
We have to do it now.	Amma gochuu qabna.
But it is not clear.	Garuu ifa miti.
I don’t think they’re real.	Isaan dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu.
I used to think nothing of it.	Duraan homaa itti hin yaadu ture.
I had no idea things were so bad	Wanti akkas hamaa akka taʼe yaada hin qabu ture
Everything is different now.	Amma wanti hundi adda.
Time is on my hands	Yeroon harka koo irra jira
I was pretty sure that would be nothing	Sun homaa akka ta'u baay'een mirkanaa'aa ture
I just didn’t say anything.	Ani homaa hin dubbanne qofa.
I love my life right now	Jireenya koo yeroo ammaa kana nan jaalladha
I can't go anymore	Kana booda deemuu hin danda'u
A girl just like her	Intala akkuma ishee fakkaattu
There was no other sensation as she did so.	Osoo isheen kana gootu miira biraa hin turre.
I thought maybe it was yours	Tarii kan kee ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
I think it says a lot	Waan baay'ee dubbata jedheen yaada
Very good in some cases.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti baayyee gaarii dha.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
He had a bad feeling about it	Miira hamaa waa'ee isaa qaba ture
I want to know more.	Caalaatti beekuu barbaada.
I never wanted to go	Ani gonkumaa deemuu hin barbaanne
He was becoming a father	Abbaa ta'aa ture
I have no idea who it is	Eenyu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
Still not long enough.	Ammas dheeraa gahaa hin ta'u.
I want to, though.	Ani nan barbaada, garuu.
You have to get the job done in plenty of time.	Yeroo baay’ee keessatti hojii sana hojjechuu qabda.
I can't eat any of them now.	Amma isaan keessaa tokkollee nyaachuu hin danda'u.
Great idea.	Yaada guddaa.
I didn't see what it was	Maal akka ta'e hin argine
I love you.	Si jaalladha.
But that came up.	Garuu sun dhufe.
I told him never to speak to me again.	Kana booda gonkumaa akka natti hin dubbanne itti hime.
He is absolutely right.	Inni guutummaatti sirrii dha.
I thought of my mother	Haadha kootti yaade
I couldn't see who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye
I need you way more than you think	Karaa ati yaaddu caalaa baay'een si barbaada
It could have been hers.	Silaa kan ishee ta'uu danda'a.
It’s not my thing though.	Waan koo miti garuu.
A lot of people were on this	Namoonni baay'een kana irratti turan
It never goes any further.	Kana caalaa gonkumaa hin deemu.
I don’t have a husband.	Abbaa manaa hin qabu.
It is in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jira.
They were drinking a lot.	Baayyee dhugaa turan.
It was everything they expected.	Isaan eegaa turan hunda ture.
That was obvious a long time ago.	Sun yeroo dheeraa dura ifa ture.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
I knew she was leaving	Akka deemtu nan beeka ture
I'm watching her right now	Yeroo ammaa kana ishee ilaalaa jira
I hadn’t thought of it that way.	Akkasitti hin yaadne ture.
But it doesn't look like this one is going to be easy.	Garuu inni kun salphaa ta'uuf deemu hin fakkaatu.
It works very well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I couldn’t tell you any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee sitti himuu hin dandeenye
I said they would do it for me	Naaf godhu jedheen
He says, it could have been her	Inni jedha, silaa ishee ta'uu danda'a ture
I won't tell you about those	Waa'ee warra sanaa sitti hin himu
I couldn’t leave them there like that	Akkasitti achitti isaan dhiisuu hin dandeenye
He knew it well enough.	Akka gaariitti beeka ture.
Which is very big and dangerous	Kan baayyee guddaa fi balaa qabu
You know it's me.	Ana ta'uu isaa beekta.
I was never good enough	Ani gonkumaa gaarii hin turre
A place that is special to you.	Bakka siif adda ta'e.
I wish that were the case	Osoo akkas ta'ee natti tola
I couldn’t even respond	Deebii kennuu illee hin dandeenye
I knew she had a lot.	Baay'ee akka qabdu nan beeka ture.
I could never have done it without him	Isa malee gonkumaa gochuu hin danda'u ture
We just wanted to ask them questions about it.	Waa’ee kanaa gaaffii isaan gaafachuu qofa barbaanne.
We still have a lot of work to do.	Ammallee hojii baay'ee qabna.
You shouldn’t do this.	Kana gochuu hin qabdu.
I think it works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta jedheen yaada.
If she did, she never spoke to me.	Yoo akkas goote garuu gonkumaa natti hin dubbanne.
The reason why soon became more clear.	Sababni maaliif akka ta'e yeroo muraasa booda caalaatti ifa ta'e.
But they don’t have it.	Garuu hin qaban.
My wife, she was in danger.	Haadha manaa koo, balaa keessa turte.
So what can I do? 	Kanaaf maal gochuu danda'a?
Wait and see.	Eegaa ilaalaa.
I didn’t need anything else	Waan biraa na hin barbaachifne
There was never a time when she wasn’t there for me.	Yeroon isheen naaf hin jirre hin turre.
So I was here.	Kanaaf as ture.
He wanted to stay in his hands	Harka isaa keessa turuu barbaade
I can't tell you any more	Kana caalaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
I don’t want it anymore.	Kana booda hin barbaadu.
They had a name.	Maqaa qaban turan.
He didn’t seem to recognize her anymore.	Kana booda waan ishee beeku hin fakkaatu ture.
It's just bad.	Hamaa qofa.
Maybe you can make him like it more	Tarii caalaatti akka isa jaallatu gochuu dandeessa
I wasn’t going to do it again.	Ammas gochuuf hin turre.
He was in the light.	Inni ifa keessa ture.
I thought he went out with friends	Hiriyyoota waliin waan ba'e natti fakkaate
I knew it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf beeka ture.
They’re not just his friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota isaa qofa miti.
Very few in the past year.	Waggaa darbe keessa baayyee muraasa.
I love everything about it	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa nan jaalladha
But I was sure this morning, if you didn't already know.	Garuu ganama kana mirkanaa'aa ture, yoo kanaan dura hin beekne.
This is obvious.	Kun ifaadha.
All you think about is work.	Wanti ati yaaddu hojii qofa.
I’m going with my daughter	Intala koo waliin deemaa jira
It's just nice when it happens.	Yeroo ta'u qofa namatti tola.
One question though.	Gaaffii tokko garuu.
Maybe it's nothing.	Tarii homaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I'm going here.	Ani as deema.
Sometimes it happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni ta’a.
I told him exactly what happened	Waan ta'e sirriitti itti hime
Someone is working.	Namni tokko hojjechaa jira.
He didn’t say anything else after that.	Sana booda waan biraa hin dubbanne.
I don't go often.	Yeroo baay'ee hin deemu.
Everything he said was true.	Wanti inni dubbate hundi dhugaa ture.
He had a job for me.	Hojii naaf qaba ture.
It was new at the time.	Yeroo sanatti haaraa ture.
I don’t want to do these things	Wantoota kana gochuu hin barbaadu
What it should be.	Waan ta'uu qabu.
No one knows his real name.	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa namni beeku hin jiru.
Try it on.	Irratti yaalaa.
Now she had to do something.	Amma waan tokko gochuu qabdi turte.
I will do it now.	Amma nan godha.
I think it’s important.	Barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
I didn't understand her	Ishee hin hubanne
I am with you.	Ani isin waliin jira.
He is definitely trying to do too much.	Garmalee hojjechuuf yaalaa akka jiru beekamaadha.
I said I had no chance.	Carraa hin qabu jedheen.
New and complete.	Haaraa fi guutuu ta'e.
You can believe it.	Amanuu dandeessu.
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Tarii eenyu akka ta'e namni beeku hin turre ta'a.
I really didn’t know what to think right now	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kana maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture
It’s just always been that way.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas qofa ture.
I don’t necessarily do that.	Ani dirqama akkas hin godhu.
Nice to meet you guys	Isin wal arguu kootti gammadeera
Not that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura miti.
I love people like that	Namoota akkasii nan jaalladha
But no one knows.	Garuu namni beeku hin jiru.
He better be to work.	Inni hojjechuuf ta'uu wayya.
I love it in everything.	Waan hundumaa keessatti baay'een jaalladha.
I want to know everything about you	Waa'ee kee waan hundumaa beekuu barbaada
I don’t want to stay in it	Ani keessa turuu hin barbaadu
Something has to come of this.	Kana keessaa wanti tokko dhufuu qaba.
It’s okay to be wrong.	Dogoggora jechuun homaa miti.
Perhaps that is the case.	Tarii akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
But who certainly shouldn't.	Garuu eenyutu mirkanaa'aa ta'uu akka hin qabne.
What he said was his simple truth.	Wanti inni jedhe dhugaa isaa isa salphaa ture.
I don't know what he said	Waan inni jedhe hin beeku
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
He knew it so well.	Inni akka malee beeka ture.
Good, good, good.	Gaarii, gaarii, gaarii.
This is happening.	Kun ta'aa jira.
It was her only hope.	Abdii ishee qofa ture.
I can't see his point	Yaada isaa arguu hin danda'u
I think that’s for sure	Sun waan mirkanaa’aa natti fakkaata
That was a very long time.	Yeroon sun yeroo baayyee dheeraa ture.
But he has it.	Garuu qaba.
Maybe it wasn't.	Tarii hin turre ta'a.
I’m not the only one saying this.	Kana kan jedhu ana qofa miti.
But you know, that says a lot about you.	Garuu beekta, sun waa'ee kee waan baay'ee dubbata.
But this seems unlikely.	Garuu kun waan hin taane fakkaata.
You need to see someone.	Nama tokko arguu qabda.
I wasn't quite sure why that was	Maaliif akkas ta'e sirriitti hin beeku ture
This has been going on for a long time.	Kun yeroo dheeraaf deemaa tureera.
He wanted to cry.	Iyyuu barbaade.
I had no time for this tonight	Halkan kana kanaaf yeroo hin qabu ture
No one told me.	Namni natti hime hin jiru.
But that’s wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora.
This can be a good thing and a bad thing.	Kun waan gaarii fi hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
I thought everything would be fine	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'a jedheen yaade
It was an easy task.	Hojii salphaa ture.
I thought, it really doesn’t matter	Anis yaade, dhuguma homaa miti
Sometimes they tell us.	Yeroo tokko tokko nutti himu.
It was a car.	Konkolaataa ture.
I understood almost nothing about them.	Waa'ee isaanii homaa naaf hin galle jechuun ni danda'ama.
Sorry, that’s not the case.	Dhiifama, akkas miti.
There are still mistakes.	Ammas dogoggora jiru.
I want to talk more about the house	Waa'ee mana sanaa caalaatti dubbachuu barbaada
I knew you were one, you were one	Ati tokko, ati tokko akka taate nan beeka ture
I hope all was going well	Hundi akka gaariitti deemaa akka ture abdiin qaba
But he wants you.	Garuu si barbaada.
Is that what happened.	Kan ta'e kanuma moo.
I think you should do that	Akkas gochuu qabda jedheen yaada
I wonder why he does that	Maaliif akkas godha jedheen yaada
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
I didn’t even have to meet her	Ishee waliin wal arguu illee hin qabu ture
I thought you were something else	Ati waan biraa natti fakkaate
I didn’t know she was going to do this now	Amma kana gochuuf akka deemtu hin beeku ture
She would be a snack.	Nyaata salphaa ta'a turte.
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu akkas miti.
But I had to do it	Ani garuu gochuun qaba ture
I don't need much space.	Bakka baay'ee na hin barbaachisu.
I was a ridiculous person.	Ani nama qoosaa ture.
Wait and wait.	Eegaa fi eegaa.
I love you so much	Baay'een si jaalladha
It should be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu qaba.
But I know that you know	Akka ati garuu akka beektu nan beeka
It is in the works.	Hojii irra jira.
Glad to see you	Si arguu kootti gammadeera
I want to do this but I don’t have the money	Kana gochuu barbaada malee maallaqa hin qabu
The timing wasn’t right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii hin turre.
This, of course, is wrong.	Kun, dogoggora akka ta’e beekamaadha.
On his hands.	Harka isaa irra.
It works them well.	Akka gaariitti isaan hojjeta.
More than anything, he wanted to help .	Waan hundumaa caalaa gargaaruu barbaade .
We can’t do it.	Hin dandeenyu.
I love you, except for the house and the money	Si jaalladha, manaa fi qarshii malee
The problem is still there, they are working on this.	Rakkoon ammallee jira, kana irratti hojjechaa jiru.
That may be true.	Sun dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
It was like being with her mother.	Akkuma haadha ishee waliin ta'uu ture.
It had images and sounds and feelings.	Suuraa fi sagalee fi miira qaba ture.
I know what you did last year	Waan bara darbe goote nan beeka
He is in a good place now	Amma bakka gaarii irra jira
I don't know anything about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku
I have some life inside me.	Jireenya tokko tokko keessa kootti qaba.
Everything was new.	Wanti hundi waan haaraa ture.
They had their eyes on me the whole time.	Yeroo guutuu ija isaanii natti qaban turan.
they may not have.	qabaachuu dhiisuu danda'u.
Only I can do this.	Kana gochuu kan danda'u ana qofa.
I don't want money.	Ani qarshii hin barbaadu.
It was a long and dangerous road.	Karaa dheeraa fi balaa qabu ture.
He looks like a completely new person.	Nama guutummaatti haaraa fakkaata.
He didn’t need to.	Inni hin barbaachifne.
He wanted to make a lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa argachuu barbaade.
My friends.	Hiriyyoota koo.
I wondered what had happened	Maaltu ta'e jedheen yaade
I didn’t know what he meant then	Yeroo sana maal jechuu akka barbaade hin beeku ture
But he still didn’t go to school.	Garuu ammas mana barumsaa hin deemne.
We’re the good guys here.	Nuti warra gaarii asitti.
I think nobody wants it	Namni barbaadu hin jiru jedheen yaada
They’re all just so good.	Hundi isaanii akkas gaarii qofa.
I won’t tell you anything bad new	Waan haaraa hamaa sitti hin himu
They matter a lot.	Isaan baayyee dhimma qabu.
I couldn't really tell him much	Dhuguma waan baay'ee itti himuu hin dandeenye
I just can't leave him	Isa dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u
But to be on the other side of that.	Garuu sanaa isa biraa irra ta'uuf.
But I would have wanted to	Silaa garuu nan barbaada ture
Just a little too long, he thought.	Xiqqoo dheeraa qofa jedhee yaade.
Not very good at that.	Sana irratti baayyee gaarii miti.
This was a lot to ask of her.	Kun waan baay'ee ishee irraa gaafachuu ture.
I can get him, you can't	Ani isa argachuu nan danda'a, ati hin dandeessu
I just need to know who is doing what.	Eenyu maal akka hojjetu beekuu qofa na barbaachisa.
I'm sure it's obvious.	Waan ifa ta'e akka ta'e mirkanaa'adha.
This isn't about that.	Kun waa'ee kanaa miti.
I know that much.	Hamma sana beeka.
I thought it was him	Isa natti fakkaate
Pretty much everything is on the road.	Waan hundumaa baay'ee karaa irra jira.
What happened was an accident.	Wanti ta'e balaa ture.
He thought he knew the way.	Karaa waan beeku itti fakkaate.
It wasn’t for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hin turre.
I'm sure it's nothing	Homaa akka hin taane mirkanaa'adha
I know she's great, but who knows what could have been	Isheen guddaa akka taate nan beeka, garuu maaltu ta'uu akka danda'u eenyutu beeka
That’s really nothing new.	Sun dhuguma waan haaraa miti.
Classes with another teacher.	Kutaa barsiisaa biraa waliin.
It happens with everything.	Waan hundumaa waliin ta'a.
Where to go.	Eessa deemuuf.
I knew it could only be one thing	Waan tokko qofa ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka ture
He had nothing more to offer.	Kana caalaa kan qabu hin turre.
Maybe it's too late now.	Tarii amma yeroon isaa darbe ta'uu hin oolu.
I was working a lot	Ani baay'ee hojjechaa ture
I want to stay clear	Ifa ta'ee turuu barbaada
I was still trying to help	Ammallee gargaaruuf yaalaa ture
You have to live.	Jiraachuu qabda.
I didn’t need anyone	Nama tokkollee na hin barbaachifne
I know how this is	Kun akkamitti akka ta'e nan beeka
It is still in operation.	Ammas hojii irra jira.
I wanted to eat more of them.	Isaan kana caalaa nyaachuu barbaade.
I love her more than life	Jireenya caalaa ishee jaalladha
I know what happened.	Waan ta'e nan beeka.
But no one helps me.	Garuu namni na gargaaru hin jiru.
I desperately need work	Hojiin baayʼee na barbaachisa
I'm sure we will.	Akka goonu mirkanaa'adha.
But I don’t know how to do it.	Garuu akkamitti akka godhu hin beeku.
I love mornings.	Ganama baay'een jaalladha.
I really have no idea.	Dhuguma yaada tokkollee hin qabu.
He might go tonight.	Halkan kana deemuu danda'a.
A moment or two passed before he spoke	Dubbachuu isaa dura yeroon tokko lama darbe
I would have known that	Silaa sana nan beeka ture
He went upstairs.	Ol deeme.
Until recently this was not true.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti kun dhugaa hin turre.
I was completely alone	Guutummaatti kophaa koo ture
I'm still very curious about them	Ammallee waa'ee isaanii baay'een fedhii qaba
' to '.	' gara '.
Then, he made it happen.	Sana booda, akka ta’u godhe.
Not really sure.	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa miti.
I mean, one of these days	Guyyaa kana keessaa tokko jechuu kooti
I never wanted this house	Mana kana gonkumaa hin barbaanne
That shouldn’t be too obvious.	Kana jechuun garmalee ifa ta’uu hin qabu.
It doesn’t mean he knows but doesn’t work.	Beeka malee hin hojjetu jechuu miti.
I mean, you are very nice	Ati baayyee namatti tola jechuu kooti
Like a real evil.	Akka hamaa dhugaa.
Everything was pretty great here.	Asitti wanti hundi baayyee guddaa ture.
I always say it	Yeroo hundumaa nan jedha
He didn’t look well.	Inni akka gaariitti hin fakkaatu ture.
I almost couldn't ask	Gaafachuu hin dandeenye jechuun ni danda'ama
I think this is a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii natti fakkaata.
I’ve enjoyed it so far	Hanga ammaatti itti gammadeera
That’s how I really saw you	Dhuguma akkasitti si arge
No one would ever want it.	Namni tokkollee gonkumaa hin barbaadu ture.
He is a tall man.	Nama dheeraa dha.
I was just a little girl	Ani intala xiqqoo qofa ture
I've been waiting for you	Si eegaa tureera
I will do as he asks	Akka inni gaafate nan godha
Isn't that pretty great?.	Sun baayyee guddaa mitii?.
I think it was three	Sadii ture jedheen yaada
Like most things.	Akkuma wantoota baay'ee.
We can’t do what we want.	Waan barbaanne gochuu hin dandeenyu.
I know this very well	Ani kana baay'een beeka
I think that would work	Sun ni hojjeta jedheen yaada
Within a year.	Waggaa tokko keessatti.
Soon he got what he wanted.	Yeroo muraasa booda waan barbaade argate.
You don’t belong anywhere else.	Ati kan bakka biraa miti.
It wasn’t much work, really.	Hojii guddaa hin turre, dhuguma.
He doesn't even have a house.	Mana illee hin qabu.
He wants to eat her	Ishee nyaachuu barbaada
I want you to need it	Ani akka isin barbaachisu barbaada
But watch what happens.	Garuu maal akka ta'u ilaalaa.
I had a lot going for me	Waan baay'ee naaf deemu qaba ture
I don’t know what else to say.	Kan biraa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku.
I mean, it's obvious.	Jechuun koo ifaadha.
They love their cars.	Konkolaataa isaanii ni jaallatu.
I don't think that's very important.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu.
You need to have a good answer.	Deebii gaarii qabaachuu qabda.
It's got an hour and we're there	Sa'aatii qaba achitti jirra
But this was different.	Garuu kun adda ture.
That, of course, was the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma akka ture beekamaadha.
But this may be the best of them all	Garuu kun hunda isaanii keessaa isa gaarii ta’uu danda’a
This could be you.	Kun si ta'uu danda'a.
Nothing was going to happen.	Wanti ta'uuf deemu hin turre.
I can't really say much more than that	Dhuguma kana caalaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu hin danda'u
This time is different.	Yeroon kun adda.
This was a very dangerous man.	Kun nama baayyee balaa qabu ture.
Now everyone has new ideas.	Amma namni hundi yaada haaraa qaba.
I thought you were someone else	Ati nama biraa natti fakkaate
Probably both of us.	Lamaan keenyayyuu ta'uu hin oolu.
I want to be a little alone	Xiqqoo kophaa ta'uu barbaada
So sorry for that.	Kanaaf dhiifama.
No more is needed.	Kana caalaa hin barbaachisu.
I am not yours.	Ani kan kee miti.
But staying for a while.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf turuu.
I mean, great.	Guddaa jechuu kooti.
This was not the case.	Kun akkas hin turre.
Someone else will be.	Namni biraa ni ta'a.
I had to do something to stop this from happening	Kun akka hin taane waan tokko gochuun qaba ture
He's becoming great.	Inni guddaa ta'aa jira.
By itself, that’s not enough.	Ofii isaatiin sun gahaa miti.
That’s how it works, simple like that.	Akkasitti hojjeta, salphaa akkasitti.
I want to make that clear	Sana ifa gochuu barbaada
I know many, many things	Waan baay'ee baay'een beeka
I know him, I know him.	Ani isa beeka.
I can't believe we can't do something	Waan tokko gochuu hin dandeenyu jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
Just not sure what that would be.	Sun maal akka ta'u qofa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I can't have you like this	Akkasitti si qabaachuu hin danda'u
They had some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko qaban turan.
If you don’t have them.	Yoo isaan hin qabne.
I always want to give, give, give.	Yoomiyyuu kennuu, kennuu, kennuu nan barbaada.
He knows exactly what he’s doing	Waan inni hojjetu sirriitti beeka
Look at my hands.	Harka koo ilaalaa.
I mean to tell you.	Sitti himuu jechuu kooti.
You have to do something for me.	Waan tokko naaf gochuu qabda.
I was just a guy.	Ani gurbaa qofa ture.
You don’t want to do that.	Isin akkas gochuu hin barbaaddu.
There is no problem there.	Achitti rakkoon hin jiru.
There’s no reason he should know.	Sababni inni beekuu qabu hin jiru.
All of this may be so.	Kun hundi akkas ta’uu danda’a.
I have to leave now	Amma irraa deemuun qaba
I told him what was going on	Waan deemaa jiru itti hime
But nothing happens.	Garuu wanti ta'u hin jiru.
Someone came out of the closet	Namni tokko kutaa manaa keessaa ba'e
I thought about what to do	Waan godhu jedheen yaade
But no one saw her.	Garuu namni ishee arge hin turre.
I didn’t think she could do that	Isheen akkas gochuu waan dandeessu natti hin fakkaatu ture
I want to know what she wants	Waan isheen barbaaddu beekuu barbaada
Only two, no more.	Lama qofa, kana caalaa hin jiru.
It was almost like she wanted it	Akka isheen barbaade jechuun ni danda'ama
Something is different this time.	Yeroo kana wanti tokko adda.
I have something to tell you.	Waan sitti himu qaba.
That's going to be true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uuf deema.
I can see it happening though.	Ta'aa jiru garuu arguu nan danda'a.
He didn’t seem to know anyone.	Nama tokkollee waan beeku hin fakkaatu ture.
I couldn't see him.	Isa arguu hin dandeenye.
I doubt she would have disliked her	Silaa ishee hin jaallattu jedheen shakka
I couldn’t leave him there	Achitti isa dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I only have my father	Abbaa koo qofa qaba
But that doesn’t work here.	Garuu sun asitti hin hojjetu.
I can't believe this	Kana amanuu hin danda'u
I was just happy to do it	Hojjechuu kootti qofa gammade
Sorry, but it's happening.	Dhiifama garuu ta'aa jira.
I totally disagree.	Ani guutummaatti walii hin galle.
Not for this one.	Isa kanaaf miti.
Except for something important.	Waan barbaachisaa tokko malee.
I didn't say anything	Ani homaa hin dubbanne
She has no children.	Ijoollee hin qabdu.
But tonight that was different.	Halkan kana garuu sun adda ture.
I should never have asked.	Silaa gonkumaa gaafachuu hin qabu ture.
But that’s not even a bad thing.	Garuu sun waan hamaa illee miti.
I love her more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa ishee jaalladha
None found his job easy.	Hojii isaa salphaa kan argate tokkollee hin jiru.
Perhaps it was just a new sense of optimism.	Tarii miira haaraa abdii gaarii qabaachuu qofa taʼuu dandaʼa.
That’s the real problem.	Rakkoon dhugaa jiru kanuma.
But now I can't imagine working anywhere else.	Amma garuu bakka biraa hojjechuu yaadu hin danda'u.
There was a lot going on.	Waan baay'een ta'aa ture.
I don't know if it's right or not.	Sirrii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
I would love to make it happen that way	Akkas akka ta'u gochuun baay'een jaalladha
I don’t have a house	Mana hin qabu
It would never have worked.	Silaa gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
He was a better man than her.	Inni nama ishee caalaa gaarii ture.
He is a good teacher.	Barsiisaa gaarii dha.
They didn’t do this.	Isaan kana hin goone.
I have no idea where you’re going	Eessa akka deemtu yaada hin qabu
It wasn’t that big of a deal.	Waan hangas guddaa hin turre.
But I don't know what happened to him.	Maal akka itti ta'e garuu hin beeku.
I think he wondered what that meant.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e yaade jedheen yaada.
I could never do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
said.	jedhe.
This is unlikely to happen.	Kun ta'uuf hin oolu.
That’s absolutely right.	Sun guutummaatti sirrii dha.
I still have this problem	Ammallee rakkoon kun qaba
I just couldn’t eat it.	Nyaachuu qofa hin dandeenye.
But it probably won’t.	Garuu akka hin taane hin oolu.
You're there.	Ati achi jirta.
I hadn’t seen his car when I left	Yeroon deemu konkolaataa isaa hin argine ture
Many still do this.	Baay'een isaanii ammallee akkasitti godhu.
That happens every hour on the clock.	Sun sa'aatii hunda sa'aatii irratti ni ta'a.
Environmental issues.	Dhimma naannoo.
But it had to be him.	Garuu isa ta'uu qaba ture.
That looked like himself.	Sun ofii isaa fakkaata ture.
I think about something	Waa'ee waan tokko nan yaada
You didn’t understand me, you didn’t understand.	Na hin hubanne, hin hubanne.
So teach me.	Kanaaf na barsiisaa.
It didn't matter what he said	Waan inni jedhe homaa hin qabu ture
I’m sorry I ever did this.	Yoomiyyuu kana gochuu kootti dhiifama.
I saw who she really was	Dhuguma eenyu akka taate isheen arge
They had something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qabu turan.
There were three people in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa namoonni sadii turan.
But we can't go back now.	Garuu amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
I don't mean it to be	Ani akkas ta'uuf jechuu koo miti
A good one, it seems	Kan gaarii, fakkaata
I truly love my job and the people I work with	Hojii koo fi namoota wajjin hojjechuu koo dhuguma nan jaalladha
It’s up there now.	Amma achi ol jira.
But I want one.	Tokko garuu nan barbaada.
We have something in common, you know.	Waan wal fakkaatu qabna, beekta.
On his condition.	Haala isaa irratti.
He had one night with friends.	Halkan tokko hiriyyoota isaa wajjin qaba ture.
I didn't want this to happen.	Kun akka ta'u hin barbaanne.
He did a good couple of days.	Guyyaa lama lama gaarii hojjete.
Another little noise.	Sagalee xiqqoo kan biraa.
Bad for us.	Hamaa nuuf.
I won’t tell you his name	Maqaa isaa sitti hin himu
Look at everything else.	Wanti biraa hundi ilaalaa.
Now, tell me.	Amma, natti himi.
All he could see was light.	Wanti inni arguu dandaʼu ifa qofa ture.
in.	keessa.
But that's not what happened.	Garuu waan ta'e kana miti.
Maybe not much, but .	Tarii baay'ee miti, garuu .
I can't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin danda'u.
I didn’t want to see it	Ani arguu hin barbaanne
It's good for you.	Siif gaarii dha.
But still one.	Garuu ammas tokko.
The job was really nothing out of the ordinary.	Hojiin sun dhuguma wanti adda taʼe hin turre.
We did the work.	Hojii hojjenne.
Then they will know about us.	Sana booda waa'ee keenya ni beeku.
Plenty of space inside.	Keessatti bakka baay'ee qaba.
He didn't say much about it.	Waa'ee kanaa waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
It's a much more common question than an answer.	Deebii caalaa gaaffii baay'ee beekamaadha.
He has a wife and some children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee tokko tokko qaba.
I know your father and mother	Abbaa kee fi haadha kee nan beeka
It will be different at night, as you may know.	Halkan adda ta'a, akkuma beektu ta'a.
It just has to play the New Year’s Eve situation.	Haala bara haaraa taphachuu qofa qaba.
Maybe this will all be fine.	Tarii kun hundi gaarii ta'a.
She was exactly that.	Isheen sirriitti kanuma turte.
We did it then and there.	Yeroo sanaa fi achitti hojjenne.
Now, you don’t care.	Amma, siif dhimma hin qabdu.
That would have been something.	Silaa sun waan tokko ta'a ture.
This was not enough.	Kun gahaa hin turre.
I like how it turned out.	Akkamitti akka ta'e natti tola.
He hadn’t worked a day	Guyyaa tokkollee hin hojjenne ture
Anyone willing to go?.	Namni deemuuf fedhii qabu jiraa?.
The old one.	Kan durii.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu dhimma hin qabu.
I really do like him	Dhuguma akka isaa nan godha
I was looking for another place.	Bakka biraa barbaadaa ture.
I seemed to know that would work for me.	Sun akka naaf hojjetu waanan beeku natti fakkaata ture.
That’s how it’s always been	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture
But I couldn’t find it.	Garuu argachuu hin dandeenye.
It’s not for us.	Nuuf miti.
You were right there.	Ati sirriitti achi turte.
I don't say that.	Akkas hin jedhu.
I can't give you everything	Waan hundumaa siif kennuu hin danda'u
Next year, maybe.	Bara dhufu, tarii.
He tried another one.	Kan biraa yaale.
Maybe that's what it is.	Tarii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
He had something else	Waan biraa qaba ture
He always said that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedha ture.
I know you didn’t know any better at the time	Yeroo sanatti kana caalaa akka hin beekne nan beeka
It didn’t happen for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf hin taane
But there is something you can do.	Garuu wanti ati gochuu dandeessu tokko jira.
There is no work.	Hojiin hin jiru.
But we have a new idea.	Garuu yaada haaraa qabna.
She has no answer.	Deebii hin qabdu.
I think this is a mistake.	Kun dogoggora natti fakkaata.
I want you to do me a little favor.	Xiqqoo tola akka naaf gootu nan barbaada.
He was very nice.	Inni baay'ee namatti tola ture.
But that never happened.	Garuu sun gonkumaa hin taane.
I can’t seem to make myself go	Akkan deemu of gochuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
I just couldn’t function.	Hojii hojjechuu qofa hin dandeenye.
I love dogs, always have	Saree nan jaalladha, yeroo hundumaa qaba
He has many ideas.	Yaada hedduu qaba.
It doesn’t matter where you are.	Bakka jirtu homaa hin qabu.
That’s just one meal.	Sun nyaata tokko qofa.
I could think of a worse way	Karaa kana caalaa hamaa taʼe yaadu nan dandaʼa ture
He couldn’t have it.	Inni qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
I like that about you though	Waa'ee kee garuu akkas natti tola
I don't want money	Ani qarshii hin barbaadu
He may not have much time	Yeroo baayʼee qabaachuu dhiisuu dandaʼa
We have to be.	Ta'uu qabna.
He still had a wife.	Ammallee haadha manaa qaba ture.
I am not alone in this response	Deebii kana keessatti kophaa koo miti
I said not this time	Yeroo kana miti jedheen
I think he knows what he’s doing	Waan hojjetu beeka jedheen yaada
It was already there.	Duraan ture.
He probably helped him that night.	Halkan sana isa gargaaruu hin oolu ture.
We only have one life.	Jireenya tokko qofa qabna.
I knew it would be my place.	Bakka koo akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
That won't be necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa hin ta'u.
Best time of the year.	Yeroo waggaa keessaa isa gaarii.
It looks good to me.	Natti gaarii fakkaata.
I can't live without her	Ishee malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
He’s the only one.	Inni qofa.
We’re not saying they do, of course.	Akkas godhu jechuu keenya miti, beekamaadha.
I think that won't be easy	Sun salphaa hin ta'u jedheen yaada
Lots of questions answered	Gaaffii baay'een deebii argate
He could never make a mistake	Yoomiyyuu dogoggora hojjechuu hin dandeenye
I wasn't so sure anymore	Kana booda akkasitti mirkanaa'aa hin turre
If you don't have it, you don't have it.	Yoo hin qabdu ta'e hin qabdu.
A lot of people do.	Namoonni baay'een ni godhu.
Unless he knows something.	Waan tokko yoo beeku malee.
I enjoyed it today	Har'a itti gammadeera
I enjoyed it very much.	Baayyee itti gammadeera.
I don't have many of them	Baay'ee isaanii hin qabu
I love that feeling.	Miira sana nan jaalladha.
It would have been different.	Silaa adda ta'a ture.
There must be something else at that point.	Yeroo sanatti wanti biraa jiraachuu qaba.
I still can't seem to find it though	Ammas waanan argachuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata garuu
I like it	Natti tola
That doesn’t mean everyone didn’t know.	Kana jechuun namni hundi hin beeku ture jechuu miti.
I can make this work	Kana akka hojjetu gochuu nan danda'a
Glad to have found you.	Si argachuu kootti gammadeera.
We had little money.	Maallaqa xiqqoo qabna turre.
But inside.	Garuu keessaa.
I mean, it was like that.	Akkas ture jechuu kooti.
I hadn’t even done my homework	Hojii manaa koo illee hin hojjenne ture
Usually he is	Yeroo baay'ee inni ta'a
To do the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechuuf.
I want to know the answer	Anis deebii kanaa beekuu barbaada
I didn't want to answer him	Deebii isaaf kennuu hin barbaanne
Nothing, it was fine.	Homaa hin qabu, gaarii ture.
He told us that.	Akkas nutti hime.
Tell them you need help.	Gargaarsa akka si barbaachisu itti himi.
The reason for this is not entirely clear.	Sababni kanaa guutummaatti ifa miti.
As much as his father, that one.	Hamma akka abbaa isaa, isa sana.
He obviously doesn’t know this.	Kana akka hin beekne ifaadha.
I was just watching there one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa achi ilaalaa ture.
I've never been on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra ta'ee hin beeku.
I know what he knows	Waan inni beeku nan beeka
But you never really know.	Garuu dhuguma gonkumaa hin beektu.
It wasn’t his.	Kan isaa hin turre.
I knew all about that	Waa'ee sanaa hunda nan beeka ture
He knew what the reason was.	Sababni isaa maal akka ta’e beeka ture.
I know you were expecting him	Isa eegaa akka turte nan beeka
Only a few weeks.	Torban muraasa qofa.
I couldn't believe what was happening	Waan ta'aa jiru amanuu hin dandeenye
I didn't know, inside	Hin beeku ture, keessa
He got the same error again.	Ammas dogoggora wal fakkaatu argate.
I know them too well	Ani garmalee isaan beeka
Very good road and hands.	Karaa fi harka baayyee gaarii.
I can't see there's a problem	Rakkoon akka jiru arguu hin danda'u
I can't see any reason why he shouldn't.	Sababni inni akka hin taane arguu hin danda'u.
I get a little lonely at home	Mana keessatti xiqqoo kophaa natti ta'a
I think that’s where he went	Bakka inni deeme sana natti fakkaata
But you are new to this.	Ati garuu kanaaf haaraa dha.
So, that was all it was.	Kanaaf, kana qofa ture.
But he had his moments.	Garuu yeroo isaa qaba ture.
I could have been that	Ani akkas ta'uu nan danda'a ture
He doesn’t do that here.	Asitti akkas hin godhu.
I know you as well as you know me	Akkuma ati na beektu si beeka
I didn't know what that meant	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I really shouldn’t say that	Dhuguma akkas jechuu hin qabu
I don't even know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
We were in a very different situation.	Haala baayyee adda ta'e keessa turre.
I knew about it.	Waa'ee isaa nan beeka ture.
Not when you look like that.	Yeroo akkas fakkaattu miti.
That’s for a reason.	Sun sababa qaba.
I didn't know much about cars	Waa'ee konkolaataa baay'ee hin beeku ture
I knew what was there	Waan achi jiru nan beeka ture
Upon.	Irratti.
I shouldn’t have spoken	Silaa dubbachuu hin qabu ture
Something is not right about all this.	Kana hunda irratti wanti tokko sirrii miti.
He must know he is still here	Ammallee as jiraachuu isaa beekuu qaba
You have to have it on hand.	Harka keessa qabaachuu qabda.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I hadn’t really thought of that	Dhuguma sana hin yaadne ture
If so, great.	Yoo akkas ta'e guddaa.
I haven’t seen you in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf si hin argine
I think she did that.	Isheen akkas goote natti fakkaata.
He knows what to do.	Waan godhu ni beeka.
He went out, went out.	Inni ba'e, ba'e.
This is not entirely true.	Kun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
But that wasn’t the worst part.	Garuu sun waan hunda caalaa hamaa hin turre.
I like everything about him	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa natti tola
That nothing is going to happen.	Homaa ta'uuf akka hin jirre.
I think it will do me good	Gaarii naaf godha jedheen yaada
It wouldn't have happened if I hadn't told you	Osoo sitti hin himne hin ta'u ture
I think it must be me	Ana ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
I said he should help me	Na gargaaruu qaba jedheen
I wish this wasn’t the case	Kun osoo hin taane natti tola
No need for that, really.	Sana hin barbaachisu, dhuguma.
Going to work and back.	Gara hojii fi deebi'uu.
Which is probably very true.	Kan tarii baayyee dhugaa ta'uu hin oolu.
So I wonder why this is happening.	Kanaaf maaliif akkas ta'aa jira jedheen yaada.
I didn't know what it was	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
It went well, apparently.	Akka gaariitti deeme, fakkaata.
There was nothing she could do.	Wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
I knew she was right	Sirrii akka taate nan beeka ture
A really good episode	Kutaa dhuguma gaarii
This was not entirely so.	Kun guutummaatti akkas hin turre.
Didn't do any work today	Har'a hojii tokkollee hin hojjenne
Our biggest one so far.	Guddaa keenya hanga ammaatti.
I think you can go now	Amma deemuu dandeessu jedheen yaada
I can see right through you	Karaa kee sirriitti arguu nan danda'a
Not like him.	Akka isaa miti.
Everyone is everyone.	Namni hundi nama hunda.
Many of them were my friends.	Baay'een isaanii hiriyyoota koo turan.
I can't talk about it right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
But luck was not with her.	Garuu carraan ishee waliin hin turre.
He was just looking for food	Nyaata qofa barbaadaa ture
But you know.	Garuu beekta.
So they can have it.	Kanaaf qabaachuu danda'u.
I have said my part	Ani kutaa koo jedheen jira
Perhaps some will.	Tarii tokko tokko ni godhu taʼa.
One time out of three it works like this.	Sadii keessaa yeroo tokko akkasitti hojjeta.
I won’t do that anymore	Kana booda akkas hin godhu
But it was too late.	Garuu yeroon booda dhufe ture.
We couldn’t have done such a good job.	Hojii gaarii akkasii hojjechuu hin dandeenyu ture.
I don't have much to offer.	Waan baay'ee hin qabu.
He wasn’t with anyone else.	Nama biraa waliin hin turre.
I mean really really great stuff	Dhuguma dhuguma waan guddaa jechuu kooti
This was very dangerous.	Kun balaa guddaa qaba ture.
He knew this wasn’t necessary.	Kun barbaachisaa akka hin taane beeka ture.
I was just waiting to be alone again	Ammas kophaa ta'uu qofa eegaa ture
I may not know tomorrow	Boru beekuu dhiisuu danda'a
Nothing, I told myself	Homaa hin qabu jedheen ofitti hime
He had no idea what he wanted to happen next.	Kana booda maaltu akka ta'u barbaadu yaada hin qabu ture.
I couldn't see very well	Baayyee gaarii arguu hin dandeenye
But I could never say that to him.	Garuu gonkumaa akkas itti jechuu hin dandeenye.
But even he has questions.	Garuu inni illee gaaffii qaba.
I haven't told him yet.	Ammallee itti hin himne.
He took the money.	Maallaqa fudhate.
You could be in that situation right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana haala sana keessa jiraachuu dandeessa.
I never knew what it was.	Maal akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
It wasn’t like that for us.	Nuuf akkas hin turre.
This is your business.	Kun dhimma keessan.
He should have done it a long time ago.	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura gochuu qaba ture.
We just didn’t.	Nuti garuu hin taane qofa.
If it's true.	Yoo dhugaa ta'e.
She was wrong.	Isheen dogoggora turte.
They go for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa deemu.
He saw you in his arms	Harka isaa keessa si arge
I shouldn’t have asked.	Silaa gaafachuu hin qabu ture.
She was him.	Isheen isa turte.
It will all be fine.	Hundi isaa gaarii ta'a.
I think you can help me	Na gargaaruu dandeessu jedheen yaada
Today I wasn't sure about anything anymore.	Har'a kana booda waa'ee homaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I hope it was a good one	Kan gaarii akka ture abdiin qaba
Usually a year.	Yeroo baayyee waggaa tokko.
That and her sense of humor.	Sun fi miira qoosaa ishee.
I know you can do the job	Hojii sana hojjechuu akka dandeessu nan beeka
He quickly walked down the street	Dafee karaa irra deeme
You can see some of them here.	Isaan keessaa muraasa isaanii as irraa arguu dandeessu.
None of them knew about it.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waa’ee kanaa hin beeku ture.
I want someone to know	Namni akka beeku nan barbaada
It was very extreme.	Baayyee garmalee ture.
He has no children.	Ijoollee hin qabu.
He thought about it tonight.	Halkan kana waa'ee isaa yaade.
Rather than something you don’t know exactly.	Waan sirriitti hin beekne irra.
I mean, look at that picture	Suuraa sana ilaalaa jechuu kooti
But there has to be a reason.	Garuu sababni jiraachuu qaba.
Look at her.	Ishee ilaalaa.
Maybe not everything.	Tarii waan hundumaa miti.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
I can't help you much	Baay'ee si gargaaruu hin danda'u
I want you to go today	Har'a akka deemtu nan barbaada
I haven’t seen him in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isa hin argine.
Before, until recently	Duraan, hanga yeroo dhiyootti
I can't comment for you.	Siif yaada kennuu hin danda'u.
I mean, knowing someone	Nama beekuu jechuu kooti
I knew he needed help	Gargaarsa akka isa barbaachisu nan beeka ture
If true, he had no car.	Yoo dhugaa ta'e konkolaataa hin qabu ture.
He is still not a boy.	Ammas gurbaa miti.
Simple and really really important to me.	Salphaa fi dhuguma dhuguma naaf barbaachisaa dha.
It was such a bad thing.	Wanti akkasii hamaa ture.
What he did.	Waan inni hojjete.
When you’re not in that you’re not there.	Yeroo ati sana keessa hin jirre ati achi hin jirtu.
I just have to tell you	Sitti himuu qofa qaba
I had no real friends	Hiriyyoota dhugaa hin qabu ture
I had no idea what it could be about	Waa'ee maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu ture
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
I told him about you	Waa'ee kee itti hime
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa.
I was pretty good at it	Ani baayyee gaarii ture
I didn’t need anything	Homaa na hin barbaachifne
A truly special moment	Yeroo dhuguma adda ta'e
Just look around you.	Naannoo keessan qofa ilaalaa.
Good? 	Gaarii?
She shouldn't have said that	Silaa waan sana isheen jechuu hin qabu ture
My work became my reason for being.	Hojiin koo sababa jiraachuu koo ta’e.
I mostly enjoyed it	Irra caalaa itti gammadeera
But it came to nothing.	Garuu homaa hin taane dhufe.
He had no children.	Ijoollee hin qabu ture.
You need time.	Yeroo si barbaachisa.
But he went away.	Garuu deeme.
I doubt it would have been	Silaa akka ture nan shakka
He knew she would, of course	Akka isheen gootu beeka ture, beekamaadha
I think you need alone time	Yeroo kophaa kee si barbaachisa jedheen yaada
I love that place so much.	Bakka sana baay'een jaalladha.
I can't leave well enough alone	Kophaa koo akka gaariitti dhiisuu hin danda'u
I think that language is good.	Afaan sun gaarii natti fakkaata.
He says he likes that.	Sana natti tola jedha.
I couldn’t find them	Isaan argachuu hin dandeenye
I don't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
You know it, you know.	Ni beekta.
I thought maybe you could.	Tarii ni dandeessu jedheen yaade.
Nothing can do it.	Wanti danda'u hin jiru.
I can't believe you made it all the way here	Karaa hunda asitti akka goote amanuu hin danda'u
It’s not just about being willing to help.	Gargaaruuf fedhii qabaachuu qofa miti.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
Maybe it was everything, he thought.	Tarii waan hundumaa ta'uu danda'a jedhee yaade.
It was a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii ture.
Lots of friends.	Hiriyyoota baay'ee.
I wasn't sure of anything	Homaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I thought he knew what you did.	Waan ati goote waan beeku natti fakkaate.
I wasn’t expecting this	Kana eegaa hin turre
Always a little more.	Yeroo hundumaa xiqqoo caalaa.
We are here to help!.	Gargaaruuf as jirra!.
Things like .	Wantoota akka .
This can get so easy.	Kun akkas salphaa ta'ee argachuu danda'a.
I really didn’t know	Dhuguma hin beeku ture
I could have told you that	Silaa akkas sitti himuu nan danda'a ture
He was here for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf as ture.
It didn't matter where.	Eessa akka ta'e homaa hin turre.
They have to do it now.	Amma gochuu qabu.
He’s a tall guy.	Inni gurbaa dheeraa dha.
Everything and everyone is important.	Wanti hundi fi namni hundi barbaachisaa dha.
But they hadn’t met my parents yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti warra koo waliin wal hin argine turan.
I think he would be lonely at home alone	Kophaa isaa mana keessatti kophaa ta'a jedheen yaada
It would have been.	Ni ta'a ture.
If you don't want to.	Yoo hin barbaanne.
It would be one of those	Silaa warra sana keessaa tokko ta'a
That's better than nothing.	Sun homaa ta'uu irra wayya.
I think it's kind of funny	Akka qoosaa ta'ee natti fakkaata
It seems to be in good shape.	Haala gaarii irra kan jiru fakkaata.
I don’t want to stay here	Ani as turuu hin barbaadu
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
I really really wanted it	Ani baay'een baay'een barbaade
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
Maybe that's how it should be.	Tarii akkas ta'uu qaba.
We were just people	Nuti namoota qofa turre
Nothing more that night.	Halkan sana kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
Maybe it was working.	Tarii hojjechaa ture ta'a.
But he knew it couldn't be.	Garuu ta'uu akka hin dandeenye beeka ture.
I know who you are	Nama ati taate nan beeka
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Tarii, tarii, tarii.
He has the best friends one could ask for	Hiriyyoota gaarii namni tokko gaafachuu dandaʼu qaba
But I need your help	Ani garuu gargaarsa keessan nan barbaada
He certainly isn’t.	Inni akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You.	Ati.
That’s just one issue.	Sun dhimma tokko qofa.
I had nothing to do with it	Ani waan kana godhu hin qabu ture
I really need it.	Dhuguma na barbaachisa.
They were a great time.	Yeroo guddaa turan.
I only saw you a few times.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa si arge.
I didn't have much to do with him.	Isa waliin waanan baay'ee hin qabu ture.
A really bad night.	Halkan dhuguma hamaa.
For a while he was my all-time favorite.	Yeroo muraasaaf inni yeroo hundumaa jaalladhu ture.
I’d rather stay that way	Akkasitti turuu naaf wayya
She has no idea.	Yaada hin qabdu.
Very early in his case.	Dhimma isaa keessatti baayyee dafee.
I don’t want to talk about it right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
Sometimes, it wasn’t at all.	Yeroo tokko tokko, tasumaa hin turre.
I don't know what to say.	Waan jedhu hin beeku.
We have a lot of things to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabnu baay'ee qabna.
This cannot be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin danda'u.
This can mean two things.	Kun waan lama jechuu danda’a.
I know people.	Namoota nan beeka.
I didn't think about that	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne
No one knows exactly the answer.	Deebii isaa sirriitti namni beeku hin jiru.
I mean, she didn’t think	Isheen hin yaadne jechuu kooti
A matter of fact.	Dhimma dhugaa.
But when he did, he was in it all.	Garuu yeroo godhu hunda keessa ture.
About the two of them together.	Waa'ee isaan lamaan waliin ta'uu.
A little bit more.	Xiqqoo caalaa.
She didn't want him thinking about her right now	Yeroo ammaa kana akka inni waa'ee ishee yaadu hin barbaanne
She became the reason.	Isheen sababa taate.
I know a lot of people	Namoota baay'een beeka
I still could, you know	Ammallee nan danda'a ture, beekta
I have no idea what this could be	Kun maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu
I have such high hopes	Abdii guddaa akkasii qaba
You know it’s not.	Akka hin taane beekta.
He just has to do something	Waan tokko gochuu qofa qaba
I don't want to be alone again	Ammas kophaa ta'uu hin barbaadu
I know it's true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka
He didn’t have time for that	Kanaaf yeroo hin qabu ture
It gave me a place to go.	Bakka itti deemu naaf kenne.
I don't think anyone should live like that.	Namni akkas jiraachuu qaba jedhee hin yaadu.
He said this stuff could be dangerous.	Wanti kun balaa qabaachuu danda'a jedhe.
I really want to go back to that time.	Yeroo sanatti deebi'uu baay'een barbaada.
I can't believe it was all an accident	Hundi isaa balaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
They were her children.	Ijoollee ishee turan.
You would know just what to do.	Silaa maal akka gootu qofa beekta.
I could do the work in my sleep	Hojii sana hirriba koo keessatti hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture
I was once one of them	Ani yeroo tokko isaan keessaa tokko ture
Something everyone around can see.	Waan namni naannoo sana jiru hundi arguu danda'u.
Or did she do it.	Moo isheen goote.
Three years ago.	Waggaa sadii dura.
He really wants the best for you.	Inni dhuguma waan gaarii siif barbaada.
I thought he meant it	Jechuun jechuu isaa natti fakkaate
Who doesn't need a house.	Kan mana hin barbaachifne.
He shouldn’t have been there	Silaa achi jiraachuu hin qabu ture
It couldn't be here.	As ta'uu hin dandeenye.
So now you are.	Kanaaf amma ati jirtu.
Everything became possible.	Wanti hundi ni danda’ama ta’e.
You have to stay with them.	Isaan bira turuu qabda.
All that is needed is money.	Wanti barbaachisu maallaqa qofa.
That’s absolutely nothing.	Sun guutummaatti homaa miti.
He looked at me with eyes.	Ija natti ilaale.
I started helping myself	Of gargaaruu jalqabe
But maybe not.	Garuu tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
Like his mother.	Akkuma haadha isaa.
I’m still looking for help here.	Ammallee asitti gargaarsa barbaadaa jira.
I’m right here with you	Ani sirriitti as jira si waliin
I'm sure they were right about that.	Waa'ee sanaa sirrii akka turan mirkanaa'adha.
This was necessary.	Kun barbaachisaa ture.
I think he’s in me	Inni na keessa jira jedheen yaada
I couldn’t do it before.	Kana dura hin dandeenye.
I don’t understand why you did that	Maaliif akkas goote naaf hin galle
But then, that doesn't mean much.	Garuu sana booda, sun waan baay'ee jechuu miti.
That does a great deal.	Sun waan guddaa hojjeta.
Getting to make mistakes.	Dogoggora gochuu argachuu.
It must be me.	Natti ta'uu qaba.
Sometimes they seem to work well.	Yeroo tokko tokko waan gaarii hojjetu fakkaata.
I think they were just that	Isaan kana qofa turan jedheen yaada
I can't think of it.	Yaadu hin danda'u.
There is nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
He’s not that bad.	Inni hangas hamaa miti.
He was waiting for one of his men.	Namoota isaa keessaa tokko eegaa ture.
I really think about that	Dhuguma sana nan yaada
She was everything.	Isheen waan hundumaa turte.
He was right.	Inni sirrii ture.
I mean, never.	Yoomiyyuu miti jechuu kooti.
She said she couldn't.	Hin danda'u jette.
But not this week.	Garuu torban kana miti.
I just can't leave you here	Ani garuu asitti qofa si dhiisuu hin danda'u
He said he couldn't.	Hin danda'u jedhe.
We both had great jobs.	Lamaan keenyayyuu hojii guddaa qabna turre.
What you said.	Waan ati jette.
He didn’t have to eat anything	Homaa nyaachuu hin qabu ture
I know it will be a lot of people	Namoota baay'ee akka ta'u nan beeka
Maybe it's just the thing.	Tarii wanti jiru qofa ta'a.
What's going on?.	Maaltu ta'aa jira?.
I don’t know the answer to that.	Deebii sanaa hin beeku.
It was so ridiculous.	Akkasitti qoosaa ture.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
That means that and .	Kana jechuun sun fi .
He lives around there.	Naannoo achi jiraata.
I don't mean that.	Kana jechuu koo miti.
It’s just the truth.	Dhugaa qofa.
I can't do this again	Ammas kana gochuu hin danda'u
I hope that helps!. 	Sun akka gargaaru abdiin qaba!. 
who works with me.	kan na waliin hojjetu.
It’s been around for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf tureera.
Of course she does.	Isheen akka gootu beekamaadha.
I didn’t speak, for the most part.	Ani hin dubbanne, irra caalaa.
Long and loud.	Dheeraa fi sagalee guddaa qabu.
I had the same idea	Anis yaada wal fakkaatu qaba ture
He looked at them again.	Ammas isaan ilaale.
There is nothing like them.	Wanti akka isaanii hin jiru.
Not entirely sure how much.	Meeqa akka ta'e guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
It should be easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa ta'uu qaba.
You may know a few.	Muraasa beektu ta'a.
I thought everyone knew by now	Yeroo ammaatti namni hundi beeka jedheen yaade
He should have seen it sooner	Silaa dafee arguu qaba ture
Sometimes even more than that.	Yeroo tokko tokko sanaa ol illee.
But that was a disaster.	Garuu sun balaa ture.
I can't even live a life.	Jireenya illee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
But that’s not what she meant.	Garuu akkas jechuu ishee miti.
Then again, it may not.	Sana booda ammas ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I could know this all day	Kana guyyaa guutuu beekuu nan danda'a ture
They didn’t have it.	Hin qaban turan.
She was wrong.	Dogoggora turte.
As if it were	Akka waan .
I wasn't sure anything would have happened	Silaa wanti tokko akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I couldn’t eat it.	Nyaachuu hin dandeenye.
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
No one had ever done that before.	Kanaan dura namni akkas godhe hin beeku.
The great one.	Kan guddaa.
No one knew much about him.	Waa'ee isaa namni waan baay'ee beeku hin turre.
I didn't want it to happen	Akka ta'u hin barbaanne
Without question one of my favorite times of the year.	Gaaffii tokko malee yeroo waggaa keessaa ani baay'ee jaalladhu keessaa tokko.
This later in the new house.	Kun booda mana haaraa keessatti.
It was a little above him now	Amma xiqqoo isa ol ture
Maybe he could help her.	Tarii ishee gargaaruu danda'a ta'a.
It made it easy.	Salphaa godhe.
They were similar in that.	Sana keessatti wal fakkaatu turan.
A little here, a little there.	Xiqqoo asitti, xiqqoo achitti.
I cannot give you what is already yours	Waan duruu kan kee ta'e siif kennuu hin danda'u
We hope it helps you.	Akka isin gargaaru abdii qabna.
What we don't talk about.	Waan wal hin dubbanne.
He had a pretty good idea who he was	Eenyu akka ta'e yaada baay'ee gaarii qaba ture
I began to know something	Waan beekuu jalqabe
I couldn’t tell you the exact date	Guyyaa sirrii sitti himuu hin dandeenye
It’s perfectly clear what’s going on.	Waan deemaa jiru guutummaatti ifaadha.
I thought we went through the whole thing	Dhimma sana hunda keessa deemne natti fakkaate
I never want to do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin barbaadu
He’ll probably apologize	Dhiifama gaafachuu hin oolu
He didn't speak.	Hin dubbanne.
I do this every morning	Ganama ganama kana nan godha
The simpler the better.	Hamma salphaa ta'e gaarii ta'a.
I didn't tell him anything else.	Anis waan biraa itti hin himne.
He didn’t have that one	Isa sana hin qabu ture
I think there’s more to it than that	Kana caalaa waan jiru natti fakkaata
Now, this was over a long time ago.	Amma, kun yeroo dheeraa ol ture.
It looks a lot like him.	Baay'ee isa fakkaata.
That's what it's supposed to be.	Sun ta'uu qaba.
He had plenty of time.	Yeroo baay'ee qaba ture.
He should have gone with them.	Silaa isaan waliin deemuu qaba ture.
She'll be fine.	Isheen gaarii ta'a.
No one has done it better.	Namni kana caalaa hojjete hin jiru.
Most likely they will be.	Baay’ee kan hin oolle ni ta’u.
They couldn’t see around them	Naannoo isaanii arguu hin dandeenye
I hope you are doing well	Akka gaariitti akka jirtu abdiin qaba
I couldn’t go any further	Kana caalaa deemuu hin dandeenye
People wanted to feel better.	Namoonni miira gaarii qabaachuu barbaadu turan.
I wasn’t a part of it for long after that.	Sana booda yeroo dheeraaf kutaa isaa hin turre.
I didn't know what she thought of him.	Isheen waa'ee isaa maal akka yaaddu hin beeku ture.
Glad to see him	Isa arguu kootti gammadeera
I was thinking about these people	Ani waaʼee namoota kanaa nan yaada ture
They would be watching everything.	Silaa waan hunda ilaalaa jiru.
That's what happened.	Kan ta'e kanuma.
We can’t do it anymore.	Kana booda hin dandeenyu.
He is in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jira.
I wondered what he was really doing	Dhuguma maal hojjechaa jira jedheen yaade
I have nothing to tell her about her father.	Waa'ee abbaa ishee homaa itti himu hin qabu.
Just like us,' she said.	Akkuma keenya,' jette.
Perhaps he does not.	Tarii hin qabu taʼa.
You know, you know.	Beektaa, ni beekta.
It wouldn't happen anymore	Kana booda hin ta'u ture
I would have wanted to.	Silaa nan barbaada ture.
Make no mistake, they have him.	Dogoggora hin qabu, isa qaban.
I have.	Ani qaba.
I just love her so much	Baay'ee ishee jaalladha qofa
He could never be the right father.	Abbaa sirrii ta’uu gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
More of that tomorrow.	Boru kanuma caalaa.
I love real friends besides my man	Nama koo malee hiriyyoota dhugaa nan jaalladha
You need a lot of help.	Gargaarsa guddaa si barbaachisa.
I'll be going soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti nan deema.
I love you too much to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf baay'een si jaalladha.
We have to go together, we have to stay together.	Waliin deemuu qabna, waliin turuu qabna.
But it can be done.	Garuu ta'uu danda'a.
I know you better than you know yourself	Ati of beektu caalaa ani si beeka
I should have said new	Silaa haaraa jechuu qaba ture
I couldn't say why.	Maaliif jechuu hin dandeenye.
I think you two should meet	Isin lamaan wal arguu qabdu jedheen yaada
It was her idea.	Yaada ishee ture.
I had no idea it existed	Jiraachuu isaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I was looking at it this morning	Har'a ganama ilaalaa ture
He did then as he does now	Yeroo sanatti akkuma ammaa godhe
I really want you to go with me tonight.	Halkan kana akka na waliin deemtu baay'een barbaada.
They didn't have much time together.	Yeroo baay'ee waliin hin qaban turan.
But with us you never know.	Garuu nu waliin gonkumaa hin beektu.
I care what you’re going through	Waan ati keessa jirtu naaf dhimma
I really should stay here tonight	Dhuguma halkan kana as turuu qaba
It was loud, so loud.	Sagalee guddaa, akka malee sagalee guddaa qaba ture.
They must make a big mistake	Dogoggora guddaa hojjechuu qabu
I have a problem with this	Kanaan rakkoon qaba
That needs to be worked on.	Sana irratti hojjechuu barbaachisa.
He is.	Inni ... dha.
I thought that’s what she wanted	Akkasitti waan barbaaddu natti fakkaate
Not what he meant.	Maal jechuu isaa miti.
He should have spoken sooner	Silaa dafee dubbachuu qaba ture
He wasn’t the one.	Inni kan hin turre.
I was very happy at home	Mana keessatti baay'een gammade
Clearly, none of this is good enough.	Kun tokkollee gaarii akka hin taane ifaadha.
Then he drove away.	Sana booda konkolaataa isaatiin deeme.
It's not going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin deemu.
I need something good before that	Sana dura waan gaarii na barbaachisa
I can't believe you did this for me	Kana naaf goote jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I want to play with him	Isa waliin taphachuu barbaada
I just want to know about him and stuff like that	Waa'ee isaa fi waan akkasii qofa beekuu barbaada
It’s not dangerous.	Balaa hin qabu.
I didn't know it was so bad	Akkas hamaa akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I never wanted to be good	Gaarii ta'uu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
I know she knows it.	Isheen akka beektu nan beeka.
Coming home for a few hours sleep.	Hirriba sa'aatii muraasaaf gara manaatti deebi'uu.
But you know your father.	Garuu abbaa kee beekta.
Maybe he doesn’t have a dog.	Tarii saree hin qabu.
I couldn't see what she had in her hand	Waan isheen harka ishee keessa qabdu arguu hin dandeenye
Most of the time, you.	Yeroo baay'ee, ati.
It wasn’t complete without him	Isa malee guutuu hin turre
This lives on.	Kun jiraata.
It wasn’t such a bad place.	Bakka hamaa akkasii hin turre.
I know everything about his life	Waa'ee jireenya isaa waan hundumaa nan beeka
That thing didn’t have her.	Wanti sun ishee hin qabu ture.
He said that would work.	Sun ni hojjeta jedhe.
I can say you are so lucky	Akkas carraa qabda jechuu nan danda'a
The problem was hers.	Rakkoon kan ishee ture.
There was no problem.	Rakkoon tokkollee hin turre.
I couldn't tell anyone	Namatti himuu hin dandeenye
They were the only two out here.	As ala turan lamaan isaanii qofa turan.
We have plenty of time now.	Amma yeroo hedduu qabna.
I always need some help	Yeroo hundumaa gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa
He did not want to know who it was	Eenyu akka taʼe beekuu hin barbaanne
I think he likes that idea	Yaada sana waan jaallatu natti fakkaata
I think anything is possible	Wanti hundi ni danda'ama jedheen yaada
I want to believe her	Ishee amanuu barbaada
But it happened.	Garuu ni ta'e.
That time is not now.	Yeroon sun amma miti.
He knew this place.	Bakka kana ni beeka ture.
But it really isn’t.	Garuu dhuguma akkas miti.
Everything was going fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deemaa ture.
We have a clear picture.	Suuraa ifa ta'e qabna.
My favorite pair.	Lamaan ani jaalladhu.
Very, very wrong.	Baayyee baayyee dogoggora.
Such a day.	Guyyaa akkasii.
I like the one here though	Kan asitti garuu natti tola
I know what is going to happen to him	Waan isa ta'uuf deemu nan beeka
I hope it helps someone	Nama tokko akka gargaaru abdiin qaba
People tell me things.	Namoonni waan tokko natti himu.
Nothing seems to help.	Wanti gargaaru hin fakkaatu.
Being.	Ta'uu.
Without a sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa malee.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
He knew what that meant.	Kana jechuun maal akka taʼe beeka ture.
I doubt that was the case though	Akkas akka ture garuu nan shakka
I didn’t want to do it again	Ammas gochuu hin barbaanne
I wasn’t going to do it	Ani gochuuf hin deemne
I did like her, too.	Anis akka ishee godhe.
You must be kidding.	Qoosaa jirtu ta'uu qaba.
Tell me what to do.	Waan godhu natti himi.
I wasn’t working for you	Ani si hojjechaa hin turre
It just worked.	Hojjete qofa.
At best we have a date.	Yoo gaarii ta'e guyyaa qabna.
I can't believe that's the case	Akkas ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
Not sure what happened there.	Waan achitti ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
Then they help me inside.	Sana booda keessa na gargaaru.
I wasn’t myself	Ani ofii koo hin turre
Then someone thought.	Sana booda namni tokko yaade.
I couldn't have done that without you	Osoo ati hin taane akkas gochuu hin danda'u ture
He still wanted to know why.	Ammas maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaade.
I just couldn’t believe my good luck	Carraa gaarii koo qofa amanuu hin dandeenye
I'm just not sure	Ani garuu mirkanaa'aa miti
I couldn’t see them.	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
That night I saw his eyes	Halkan sana ija isaa arge
Maybe it's too soon.	Tarii dafee ta'uu danda'a.
Now they love it.	Amma ni jaallatu.
No one wants to play with him.	Namni isa waliin taphachuu barbaadu hin jiru.
They must be a bad place.	Bakka hamaa ta'uu qabu.
I told her you knew her	Anis akka ati ishee beektu itti hime
I wanted to give up everything	Waan hundumaa dhiisuu barbaade
I didn’t want to know his thoughts	Yaada isaa beekuu hin barbaanne
We agreed that it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane irratti walii galle.
Then I saw little	Sana booda waan xiqqoo arge
But that’s not how it should work.	Garuu akkasitti hojjechuu hin qabu.
Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow but it will happen.	Tarii har'a miti tarii boru miti ta'a garuu ni ta'a.
That’s why we have it.	Kanaaf qabna.
You have to tell me what you want.	Maal akka barbaaddu natti himuu qabda.
I said that yesterday	Kaleessa akkas jedheen ture
I looked at him closely	Anis sirriitti isa ilaale
I couldn’t give it a chance anymore.	Kana booda carraa itti kennuu hin dandeenye.
But they have money.	Garuu qarshii qabu.
But she is not interested.	Garuu fedhii hin qabdu.
This night was later than usual.	Halkan kun yeroo biraa caalaa booda ture.
I knew there was something different about you	Waa'ee kee wanti adda ta'e akka jiru nan beeka ture
You don’t know what you want.	Waan barbaaddu hin beektu.
To that extent, you know now.	Hanga sanatti amma beekta.
I always had this feeling	Yeroo hundumaa miira kana qaba ture
He couldn't speak, just looked at her.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye, ishee ilaale qofa.
None of this is certain.	Kun tokkollee mirkanaa’aa miti.
I know what she wants	Waan isheen barbaaddu nan beeka
It’s been around for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf tureera.
This is completely wrong.	Kun guutummaatti dogoggora.
I knew there was more	Kana caalaa akka jiru nan beeka ture
They have to meet.	Wal arguu qabu.
I knew something was up	Waan tokko akka ta'e nan beeka ture
You just knew he wanted you	Akka si barbaadu qofa beekta turte
Go to your house.	Mana keessan deemaa.
It's working today.	Har'a hojjechaa jira.
I hope this helps you	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba
No one knew what that meant.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe namni beeku hin turre.
I’m still working on it.	Ammallee irratti hojjechaa jira.
That’s kind of like .	Sun akka waan .
I want to believe it.	Ani amanuu barbaada.
Look up!.	Ol ilaalaa!.
He knows his voice so well.	Sagalee isaa akka malee beeka.
There was hope in that room.	Kutaa sana keessa abdiin ture.
I wondered if something had happened	Waan tokko ta'ee jiraa jedheen yaade
Very good stuff, just very good!.	Wantoota baayyee gaarii, baayyee gaarii qofa!.
I haven’t been here for a bit	Xiqqoo as hin turre
He saw it coming.	Inni dhufuu isaa arge.
That little bit .	Xiqqoo sana .
I knew where she was	Eessa akka jirtu nan beeka ture
I shouldn't have made you do that tonight	Halkan kana akkas akka gootu si gochuu hin qabu ture
They were wrong in this.	Kana keessatti dogoggora turan.
I like it a little bit	Xiqqoo natti tola
After their light that is.	Ifa isaanii booda jechuun.
I think he knows what happened	Waan ta'e waan beeku natti fakkaata
It’s nothing but yourself and what you want to do.	Ofii fi waan hojjechuu barbaaddu malee homaa miti.
You have to live in it.	Keessa jiraachuu qabda.
They are going.	Isaan deemaa jiru.
That's what I said.	Akkas jedheen ture.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
No one knows what he’s doing.	Waan inni hojjetu namni beeku hin jiru.
I need to know you want me.	Na barbaaddu beekuu qaba.
I just need another hour	Sa'aatii biraa qofa na barbaachisa
I know what you just said	Waan amma jette nan beeka
It has never been different from that	Sana irraa adda ta'ee hin beeku
I want a lot more than that	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee barbaada
I don't know why that is.	Maaliif akkas akka ta'e hin beeku.
It would have been someone else for him.	Silaa isaaf nama biraa ta'a ture.
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
I don't know what's going on.	Maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
I'm not very committed	Ani baay'ee kan of kenne miti
It doesn't, of course.	Hin ta'u, beekamaadha.
Nothing like that happened there.	Achitti wanti akkasii hin taane.
I didn’t do that.	Ani akkas hin goone.
I have no idea.	Ani yaada hin qabu.
She is not real.	Isheen dhugaa miti.
In the night.	Halkan keessa.
It does work.	Ni hojjeta.
But so far, so good.	Garuu hanga ammaatti, akkas gaarii.
This works in other cases, but not here.	Kun haala biraa keessatti hojjeta, garuu asitti hin hojjetu.
Seems easy enough to do.	Hojjechuuf salphaa gahaa fakkaata.
I still couldn’t see him well enough	Ammallee akka gaariitti isa arguu hin dandeenye
It would have been nice enough.	Silaa gahaa ta'ee namatti tola.
I didn’t understand everything	Waan hundumaa naaf hin galle
I didn’t see them properly.	Ani sirriitti isaan hin argine.
Opportunity doesn’t come looking for you.	Carraan si barbaadaa hin dhufu.
This is no longer a new idea.	Kana booda kun yaada haaraa miti.
There are just too many people who don't know.	Namoonni hin beekne baay'ee qofa.
That's how I'm looking at it.	Akkasitti ilaalaa jira.
She did just that.	Isheen kanuma goote.
Hours and hours every night.	Halkan hunda sa'aatii fi sa'aatii.
But it still wasn’t enough.	Garuu ammas gahaa hin turre.
I don't want to be like my parents	Akka warra koo taʼuu hin barbaadu
But this is just wrong.	Garuu kun dogoggora qofa.
I still really wanted it	Ammas baay'een barbaada ture
I can't tell you all this	Kana hunda sitti himuu hin danda'u
I know why you didn’t tell me	Maaliif akka natti hin himne nan beeka
He found himself in a lot of trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa of argate.
Can't tell me enough about you.	Waa'ee kee gahaa natti himuu hin danda'u.
To.	Gara.
I can do that later.	Booda sana gochuu nan dandaʼa.
I never know what he did	Waan inni godhe gonkumaa hin beeku
He knew what he was doing that night.	Halkan sana maal akka hojjetu ni beeka ture.
You’re here now.	Amma as jirta.
Good night.	Halkan gaarii.
But I was happy to see them.	Isaan arguu kootti garuu gammadeera.
But no one has seen him yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti namni isa arge hin jiru.
I like what you said	Waan ati jette natti tola
It was me who came out	Kan ba'e ana ture
You never know what is going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf deemu gonkumaa hin beektu.
You should ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu qabdu.
What he has	Waan inni qabu
Probably all of those things.	Tarii wantoota sana hunda.
Still not a big deal.	Ammas waan guddaa miti.
But that didn’t last long.	Garuu sun yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I didn’t know you were willing to work.	Hojii hojjechuuf fedhii akka qabdu hin beeku ture.
Always.	Yeroo hunda.
It's not about anything.	Waa'ee tokkollee miti.
I don't even know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
I could have done so much for you	Silaa waan baay'ee siif gochuu nan danda'a ture
We were together for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf waliin turre.
It wasn’t true.	Dhugaa hin turre.
I know you love her very much	Baay'ee akka ishee jaallattu nan beeka
I really like this .	Kana baay'een jaalladha .
I didn’t want to apologize	Dhiifama gaafachuu hin barbaanne
I'm sorry he's not there.	Inni hin jiru jedheen dhiifama.
I didn’t know who she was	Eenyu akka taate hin beeku ture
In the room.	Kutaa keessa.
I wanted to be yours	Kan kee ta'uu barbaade
She used to expect me to do it.	Dura akkan akkan godhu na eegaa turte.
It's not very complete.	Baay'ee guutuu miti.
I used to be like that, of course	Duraan akkas akkan ture beekamaadha
I didn’t think you were here.	Ati as jirta jedhee hin yaadne.
Not on him, but on my life, on myself.	Isa irratti osoo hin taane, jireenya koo irratti, ofii koo irratti.
I'll go with him	Isa waliin nan deema
But nothing was right for him.	Garuu wanti isaaf ta'u hin turre.
He seemed curious.	Inni waan beekuu barbaadu fakkaata ture.
I didn't get too worked up about it.	Waa'ee kanaa garmalee hin hojjenne.
I am completely happy.	Guutummaatti gammadeera.
I wondered how old he was	Umuriin isaa meeqa jedheen yaade
I didn’t want her to know that she could do this.	Kana gochuu akka dandeessu akka beektu hin barbaanne.
Maybe it's a must.	Tarii dirqama ta'a.
I have to admit, she was right	Ani amanuu qaba, isheen sirrii turte
It's been easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa ta'ee ture.
I think you could have done something	Silaa waan tokko gochuu dandeessa jedheen yaada
So, we have to live together.	Kanaaf, waliin jiraachuu qabna.
But not in my opinion.	Garuu akka kootti miti.
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
No problem	Rakkoo hin qabu
I know you probably believe me	Na amanuu akka hin oolle nan beeka
I didn't even have time	Yeroon iyyuu hin qabu ture
That should be there.	Sun achi jiraachuu qaba.
I didn't think it would be like that	Akkas ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
No one was going to help them.	Namni isaan gargaaruuf deemu hin turre.
But of course not.	Garuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I couldn't help it.	Gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I certainly wasn’t one of them	Ani isaan keessaa tokko akkan hin turre beekamaadha
But mostly it’s never that bad.	Garuu irra caalaa gonkumaa akkas hamaa miti.
I thought you were different	Ati adda natti fakkaate
Today her one person was me.	Har'a ishee namni tokko ana ture.
I always loved her name	Yeroo hundumaa maqaa ishee nan jaalladha ture
I could never have done it.	Silaa gonkumaa gochuu hin danda'u ture.
He wanted to see it.	Arguu barbaade.
Can't find anything that works	Waan hojjetu argachuu hin danda'u
I have a lot tomorrow	Boru waan baay'een qaba
This was so very special.	Kun akkas baayyee adda ture.
I love you so much	Baay'een si jaalladha
Comment.	Yaada kennuu.
In the car.	Konkolaataa keessa.
I’m not saying you’re not real	Ati dhugaa miti jechuu koo miti
I didn’t really mean it.	Dhuguma jechuu koo hin turre.
You’ll need two.	Lama si barbaachisa.
People were not good for no reason.	Namoonni sababa malee gaarii hin turre.
I want.	Nan barbaada.
I didn't want to be like that	Ani akkas ta'uu hin barbaanne
It was just one thing with these people.	Namoota kana waliin waan tokko qofa ture.
I knew she always wanted the best for me	Yeroo hundumaa wanta gaarii akka naaf barbaaddu nan beeka ture
I have no intention of going	Ani deemuuf yaada hin qabu
He didn't need an hour.	Sa'aatii tokkollee isa hin barbaachifne.
You have to go back sometime.	Yeroo tokko duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
It’s just hope.	Abdii qofa.
I don't even know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
Things were better then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti jiru wayya ture.
He still didn’t say anything	Ammallee homaa hin dubbanne
But he won’t be of any help to you.	Garuu inni gargaarsa tokkollee siif hin godhu.
I want to see you both soon	Dafee isin lamaan arguu barbaada
I know what it’s like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka
I was happy with this prospect	Abdii kanaan gammade
I think this should happen.	Kun ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
Some time ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura.
I don't want anything	Ani homaa hin barbaadu
They are good people.	Namoota gaarii dha.
I shouldn’t have said anything.	Silaa homaa dubbachuu hin qabu ture.
They are in there.	Isaan achi keessa jiru.
You know who knows my parents.	Warra koo beeku beekta.
I couldn't tell you exactly why	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti sitti himuu hin danda'u ture
I thought I could play	Taphachuu danda'a jedheen yaade
He didn't speak.	Hin dubbanne.
She said she was really good with her.	Dhuguma ishee waliin gaarii dha jette.
You can see this much.	Hamma kana arguu dandeessu.
I was hers.	Ani kan ishee ture.
I knew he had no money	Maallaqa akka hin qabne nan beeka ture
More people know each other than they ever will.	Namoonni baay'een yoomiyyuu wal beeku caalaa wal beeku.
He has a medical need	Fedhii yaalaa qaba
But it's almost more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
I wouldn't have thought that about you	Silaa waa'ee kee akkas hin yaadu ture
He’s in one of our rooms.	Inni kutaa keenya keessaa tokko keessa jira.
But not much.	Garuu baay'ee miti.
I knew that answer.	Deebii sana nan beeka ture.
I will not let her see my children.	Ijoollee koo akka isheen hin argine nan godha.
He wants the truth.	Dhugaa barbaada.
I wanted to know so much more	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee beekuu barbaade
But I didn't know you	Ani garuu si hin beekne
Which she did.	Kan isheen goote.
That’s how we did it.	Akkasitti hojjenne.
Like a lot of.	Akka baay'ee.
I already know what your job is	Hojiin kee maal akka ta'e duruu beeka
His stuff is extremely good.	Wanti isaa garmalee gaarii dha.
I had both my parents	Warra koo lamaan qaba ture
I was always home alone	Yeroo hundumaa kophaa koo mana jira ture
Who would have thought?.	Silaa eenyutu yaada ture?.
No one understood	Namni hubate hin jiru
I really want to see them again	Ammas isaan arguu baay'een barbaada
But today it was nothing.	Har'a garuu homaa hin turre.
I had the same reaction	Anis deebii wal fakkaatu qaba ture
There are no jobs in this area.	Naannoo kana keessatti hojiin hin jiru.
I want it so badly.	Ani akka malee barbaada.
Luckily for me, I thought	Akka carraa kootti yaade
I am with him at my work.	Hojii koo irratti waliin jira.
But they don’t mean it badly.	Garuu hamaa jechuu isaanii miti.
He, like.	Inni, akka.
I’m not really into what I’m saying	Dhuguma waanan jedhu keessa hin jiru
I don’t think either of us thought it would last.	Lamaan keenyayyuu waan turuuf waan yaadne natti hin fakkaatu.
Not really sure on that.	Sana irratti dhuguma mirkanaa'aa miti.
Maybe you never did.	Tarii ati gonkumaa hin goone ta'a.
I can't ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u.
I don't know why this is.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
If not more than that.	Yoo kana caalaa hin taane.
We were inside.	Keessa turre.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
I'm on one right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana tokko irra jira.
I'm not, it can't be	Ani miti, ta'uu hin danda'u
I hope he does.	Akka godhu abdiin qaba.
This could happen again.	Kun ammas ta’uu danda’a.
So, so, so lucky.	Kanaaf, akkas, akkas carraa.
For this reason,.	Sababa kanaaf,.
I was willing to do it	Anis gochuuf fedhii qaba ture
I wouldn’t have needed anything else	Silaa waan biraa na hin barbaachisu ture
Not on your life.	Jireenya kee irratti miti.
Now I’m watching you both	Amma lamaan keessan ilaalaa jira
He knows everything.	Waan hundumaa ni beeka.
But people want to know who you are.	Namoonni garuu eenyu akka taate beekuu barbaadu.
But it was.	Garuu ni ture.
I just hadn’t seen her in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee hin argine qofa ture
Perhaps that is what it is.	Tarii kanuma taʼuu hin oolu.
I have a lot to tell you	Waan baay'een sitti himuu qaba
Right now that’s not necessary.	Yeroo ammaa kana sun barbaachisaa miti.
I don’t want to go without you.	Si malee deemuu hin barbaadu.
He knew that before he could say how.	Akkamitti jechuu osoo hin dandeenye sana beeka ture.
It has a great sound.	Sagalee guddaa qaba.
My true parents.	Warra koo dhugaa.
I love when he does that	Yeroo inni akkas godhu baay'een jaalladha
Just one, probably out of place.	Tokko qofa, tarii bakka hin qabne.
That’s not the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma miti.
That’s perfectly fine though.	Sun garuu guutummaatti gaarii dha.
But I have no idea why.	Garuu maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I really wanted her right now	Yeroo ammaa kana baay'een ishee barbaade
I know he has it.	Akka qabu nan beeka.
I have a lot to say about that book	Waa'ee kitaaba sanaa waan baay'ee jedhu qaba
But it could have been good.	Garuu silaa gaarii ta'uu danda'a ture.
I know the real reason	Sababni isaa isa dhugaa nan beeka
You know what you did.	Waan goote ni beekta.
They loved the area.	Naannoo sana ni jaallatu turan.
He wasn’t a human being.	Nama hin turre.
But he did something else important.	Garuu waan barbaachisaa kan biraa hojjete.
. . . .	.
It looked like tomorrow would be a day of questions.	Boru guyyaa gaaffii waan ta'u fakkaata ture.
They are not entirely wrong.	Guutummaatti dogoggora hin qaban.
It was a very bad thing.	Waan baayyee hamaa ture.
The timing was right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii ture.
I know my dog ​​does.	Saree koo akka gootu nan beeka.
It wasn’t my thing.	Waan koo hin turre.
They're about to make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuuf jedhu.
Maybe I'm not saying it right.	Tarii sirriitti jechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
If it were a girl.	Osoo intala ta'ee.
Something was wrong up there.	Achi ol wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
I can get my work done on time	Hojii koo yeroon hojjechuu nan danda'a
I already knew what she was thinking	Maal akka yaaddu duruu beeka ture
Instead.	Bakka isaa.
Love the things.	Wantoota jaalladhu.
That works well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Never not at all.	Gonkumaa tasumaa miti.
I’d rather say that again	Ammas akkas jechuun naaf wayya
I had no idea what to do tonight	Halkan kanaa maal akkan godhu yaada hin qabu ture
This is not yet complete.	Kun hanga ammaatti guutuu miti.
This wasn’t just dedication.	Kun of kennuu qofa hin turre.
I didn't think this would be possible for you.	Kun siif danda'a jedhee hin yaadne ture.
She needs our help.	Gargaarsa keenya ishee barbaachisa.
It looked a little too good to be true.	Xiqqoo baay'ee gaarii fakkaata ture.
You know nothing about the work.	Hojii keessaa homaa hin beektu.
I didn't know what was going on in her life	Jireenya ishee keessatti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
This wasn’t good enough.	Kun gaarii hin turre.
There was nothing there for him.	Achitti wanti isaaf ta'u hin turre.
They were the only friends he had.	Hiriyyoota inni qabu isaan qofa turan.
Not much, but some.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane tokko tokko.
I can't do everything.	Waan hundumaa gochuu hin danda'u.
She said it was mine.	Kan kooti jette.
But then again she should have known better.	Garuu sana booda ammas silaa caalaatti beekuu qabdi turte.
I know the good and the bad in it	Gaarii fi hamaa keessa jiru nan beeka
I was just playing with you	Si waliin taphachuu qofa ture
You have to have help.	Gargaarsa qabaachuu qabda.
So no long-term commitment.	Kanaaf waadaa yeroo dheeraa hin jiru.
What did I think	Maal jedheen yaade
I couldn't be with someone	Nama tokko waliin ta'uu hin dandeenye
I didn’t even want to	Ani iyyuu hin barbaanne
Then he is gone.	Sana booda inni hin jiru.
I want to scream but I can't find my voice	Iyyuu barbaada garuu sagalee koo argachuu hin danda'u
But this is not working.	Garuu kun hojjechaa hin jiru.
I know almost nothing about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama.
No one wants her here.	Asitti namni ishee barbaadu hin jiru.
They just need you right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana qofa si barbaadu.
But they have good reason.	Garuu sababa gaarii qabu.
I have plenty of time	Yeroo baay'een qaba
I'm looking for it.	Ani barbaada.
But he has it.	Garuu qaba.
I know enough to say	Waan jedhu gahaa nan beeka
I was in a great mood this morning.	Ganama kana miira guddaa keessa ture.
With complete abandonment.	Guutummaatti dhiisuu waliin.
More likely about, then.	Caalaatti waa'ee ta'uu danda'a, kanaaf.
I really couldn’t believe he was gone	Dhuguma akka inni hin jirre amanuu hin dandeenye
I was home today.	Har'a mana ture.
She is never without him.	Isheen gonkumaa isa malee hin jirtu.
But that was all later.	Garuu sun hundi booda ture.
She still has it.	Hanga ammaatti qabdi.
I hadn’t noticed him before	Kanaan dura isa hin hubanne ture
She hadn’t done anything.	Homaa hin goone turte.
Not sure if you know this.	Kana beektu ta'uu kee mirkanaa'aa miti.
But, it was nothing anymore.	Garuu, kana booda homaa hin turre.
It was better than the truth.	Dhugaa irra wayya ture.
He never has a good answer to his question	Gaaffii isaa kanaaf deebii gaarii gonkumaa hin qabu
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
Today, tomorrow, next week.	Har'a, boru, torban dhufu.
I might not have recognized them on the street	Silaa karaa irratti isaan hin beeku ta'a
It’s all here.	Hundi isaa as jira.
He is no longer there.	Kana booda hin jiru.
He had plenty of time	Yeroo hedduu qaba ture
He looked good tonight.	Halkan kana gaarii fakkaata ture.
I didn’t know what to make of this response	Deebii kana maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
It's very long.	Baayyee dheeraa dha.
It’s not your room.	Kutaa keessan miti.
He thought about it all the time	Yeroo hunda itti yaada ture
I saw you outside his room yesterday	Kaleessa kutaa isaa ala si arge
That this is a disaster.	Kun balaa akka ta’e.
I didn’t realize anyone owned this place	Bakka kana namni akka qabu hin hubanne
It just has to.	Qaba qofa.
I didn't know what was supposed to happen	Waan ta'uu qabu hin beeku ture
I want to stay home with you	Si waliin mana turuu barbaada
Should be back tomorrow morning.	Boru ganama deebi'uu qaba.
I hadn’t thought of it that way before.	Kanaan dura akkasitti hin yaadne ture.
I have to tell you this	Kana sitti himuu qaba
And I was working for us	Anis nuuf hojjechaa ture
I started playing a little bit	Xiqqoo taphachuu jalqabe
He enjoyed it very much.	Inni baayʼee itti gammade.
To help each other.	Wal gargaaruuf.
What works in one situation may not work in another.	Wanti haala tokko keessatti hojjetu haala biraa keessatti hojjechuu dhiisuu danda’a.
Tell him that.	Akkas itti himi.
But you won’t do it anymore.	Garuu kana booda hin gootu.
I mean, there is, but it doesn't happen	Ni jira jechuu kooti, ​​garuu hin ta'u
I already know that name, of course	Maqaa sana duruu beeka, beekamaadha
He was just a nice guy.	Inni nama gaarii qofa ture.
Two of my favorite people.	Namoota ani baay'ee jaalladhu keessaa lama.
And I did, a long time ago	Anis nan godhe, yeroo dheeraa dura
He’s not coming.	Inni hin dhufu.
I was across the street, looking at cars, you know	Ani karaa biraa ture, konkolaataa ilaalaa ture, beekta
That’s the only chance they have	Carraa isaan qaban kana qofa
I hadn’t thought of any	Ani tokkollee hin yaadne ture
It couldn't have been better	Kana caalaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture
I don’t want to go anywhere else.	Bakka biraa deemuu hin barbaadu.
I was one of them.	Ani tokko ture.
I’m not a little girl	Ani intala xiqqoo miti
He has a good voice.	Sagalee gaarii qaba.
I said it was going to happen	Ta'uuf jira jedheen
I know you did your best	Waan dandeessu hunda akka goote nan beeka
I couldn’t eat anything.	Homaa nyaachuu hin dandeenye ture.
Not another question.	Gaaffii biraa miti.
I looked up at the clock	Ol jedheen sa'aatii sana ilaale
He could buy what he needed.	Waan isa barbaachisu bitachuu dandaʼa ture.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
He is not the man he used to be.	Inni nama duraan ture miti.
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I still can't.	Ammallee hin danda'u.
She wasn’t perfect, but no one is.	Isheen guutuu hin turre, garuu namni guutuu hin taane.
He wanted to know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaade
Him, not so sure.	Isa, akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
John was delighted.	Yohaannis ni gammade.
He could have had it.	Inni qabaachuu danda'a ture.
We are good people.	Nuti namoota gaarii dha.
It really was the worst thing.	Dhuguma waan hunda caalaa hamaa ture.
They will come.	Isaan ni dhufu.
I almost made a mistake.	Dogoggora hojjechuuf jedheen ture.
If he's that good.	Yoo inni akkas gaarii ta'e.
She is not my mother.	Isheen haadha koo miti.
Look at what we have done.	Mee waan hojjenne ilaalaa.
Tom couldn’t see anything.	Toom homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
Wife and children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee.
I wanted to know your name	Maqaa kee beekuu barbaade
It’s obvious.	Ifa dha.
We were still watching.	Ammallee ilaalaa turre.
That time has passed.	Yeroon sun darbe.
It doesn’t do anything at all.	Tasumaa homaa hin hojjetu.
That’s what it looked like.	Sun akkas fakkaata ture.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Waan ta'u hin beeku ture
He didn’t see me.	Inni na hin argine.
We are together now.	Amma waliin jirra.
I didn’t think it was inevitable	Ani garuu waan hin oolle natti hin fakkaatu ture
I have so much in my life with you	Jireenya koo keessatti waan baay'ee si waliin qaba
It was better that way.	Akkasitti wayya ture.
It was too good and too nice.	Garmalee gaarii fi garmalee namatti tola ture.
I wanted to do the same.	Anis akkas gochuun barbaade.
I began to believe it	Anis itti amanuu jalqabe
I knew there wasn't much he could do	Waan inni gochuu danda'u baay'ee akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
I was that kind of girl sometimes	Ani yeroo tokko tokko intala akkasii ture
But we are here to help.	Garuu gargaaruuf as jirra.
I knew why, but I couldn't say anything	Maaliif akka ta'e nan beeka ture, garuu homaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye
Just too good to be true.	Garmalee gaarii qofa.
He knows himself better	Caalaatti of beeka
If that were true.	Osoo sun dhugaa ta'ee.
I love my home here	Mana koo asitti baay'een jaalladha
I didn’t know him well	Ani sirriitti isa hin beeku ture
Check out your new space.	Bakka haaraa keessan ilaalaa.
Now it's my opinion.	Amma kan yaada kooti.
I didn’t think he wanted me	Ani waan na barbaadu natti hin fakkaatu ture
I have a lot to think about	Waan baay'ee itti yaadu qaba
He didn't do that.	Akkas hin goone.
I thought you were the only one	Ati qofa natti fakkaate
He was there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi ture.
Of.	Kan.
He just wants you to know one thing	Waan tokko qofa akka beektu barbaada
You are certainly unique.	Ati adda akka taate beekamaadha.
I just didn't know why	Maaliif akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
He has to do his job.	Hojii isaa hojjechuu qaba.
I am still very happy.	Ammas baay'ee gammadeera.
I do this, every day	Kana nan godha, guyyaa hunda
That's what can happen.	Kan ta'uu danda'u kanuma.
I didn’t even want her here tonight	Halkan kana asitti illee ishee hin barbaanne
I wanted to believe her so badly.	Baay'ee ishee amanuu barbaade.
I love our house.	Mana keenya nan jaalladha.
I had nothing to do with you yet	Ani hanga ammaatti homaa si waliin gochuu hin qabu ture
I couldn't find it ahead of time.	Yeroo dura argachuu hin dandeenye.
But not a little.	Garuu xiqqoo miti.
But none of it comes.	Garuu tokkollee hin dhufu.
This was very important.	Kun baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
I love you all	Hundi keessan isin jaalladha
It’s still mine.	Ammallee kan kooti.
We shouldn’t give him a chance.	Carraa isaaf kennuu hin qabnu.
I can't be like that	Ani akkas ta'uu hin danda'u
I have been watching the situation	Haala jiru ilaalaa tureera
She is not dangerous.	Isheen balaa hin qabdu.
I didn’t notice any problems	Rakkoo tokkollee hin hubanne
I mean, look at this place	Bakka kana ilaalaa jechuu kooti
Even this same hand.	Harka wal fakkaatu kana illee.
So, every single person needs to work all the time.	Kanaaf, namni tokko tokko tokko yeroo hunda hojjechuu barbaachisa.
But it’s so wrong, so badly wrong.	Garuu akkas dogoggora, akkas hamaa dogoggora.
You never know.	Yoomiyyuu hin beektu.
I don't know what to say.	Waan jedhu hin beeku.
You have to have some.	Tokko tokko qabaachuu qabda.
Not so exactly, obviously.	Akkas sirriitti miti, ifaadha.
I was doing exactly the same thing	Anis sirriitti kanuma hojjechaa ture
You wouldn’t do it.	Ati hin gootu turte.
I wish they didn't have to do it	Osoo isaan gochuu hin qaban ta'ee natti tola
They were all good.	Hundi isaanii gaarii turan.
Here was a man.	Asitti namni tokko ture.
Great problems and great opportunities	Rakkoo guddaa fi carraa guddaa
I didn't want that to happen anymore.	Kana booda akkas ta'uu hin barbaanne.
It would be a dangerous job.	Hojii balaa qabu ta'a.
No luck so far.	Hanga ammaatti carraa hin qabu.
I don't do it.	Ani hin godhu.
She hadn’t thought about any of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin yaadne turte.
I think you’re right	Sirrii jette natti fakkaata
A lot of people were waiting, like us.	Namoonni baay'een eegaa turan, akkuma keenya.
I am not a thinker.	Ani nama yaadu miti.
I need a place.	Bakka na barbaachisa.
It was just an idea.	Yaada qofa ture.
Really.	Dhuguma.
I mean later this morning	Ganama kana booda jechuu kooti
Hopefully it’s nothing serious.	Waan hamaa akka hin taane abdii qabna.
You don’t understand.	Siif hin galle.
Do you have a chance?.	Carraa qabduu?.
Still, this stuff has to happen.	Ammas ta’ee, wanti kun ta’uu qaba.
I wanted to know everything about him	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa beekuu barbaade
It was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture.
I love her, you know	Ani ishee jaalladha, beektaa
I want to help with that	Sana keessatti gargaaruu barbaada
I almost couldn't do it	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye jechuun ni danda'ama
She was very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola turte.
This may not be the case in real life.	Kun jireenya dhugaa keessatti ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
But I knew we had to do something	Waan gochuu akka qabnu garuu nan beeka ture
I have no idea why	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
I thought it was right	Sirrii natti fakkaate
I love that guy.	Gurbaa sana nan jaalladha.
I know that would really help me a lot	Sun dhuguma baayʼee akka na gargaaru nan beeka
How can it be.	Akkamitti ta'uu danda'a.
Now you need an answer.	Amma deebii si barbaachisa.
I thought that was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora natti fakkaate.
I've always loved it.	Yeroo hundumaa baay'een jaalladha.
I am no longer alone	Kana booda kophaa koo miti
I have no idea where it is	Eessa akka jiru yaada hin qabu
The only problem is who.	Rakkoon jiru eenyu qofa.
I think that will do it, guys	Sun ni godha jedheen yaada gurbaa
Then someone new.	Sana booda nama haaraa.
But one cannot leave it at that.	Garuu namni tokko akkasitti dhiisuu hin danda'u.
Nothing at all, really.	Tasumaa homaa miti, dhuguma.
I wasn't being that girl	Intala sana ta'aa hin turre
Then he saw them.	Sana booda isaan arge.
It was a little early	Xiqqoo dafee ture
It was a desire.	Fedhii ture.
Someone thought these things.	Namni tokko wantoota kana yaade.
It was very large.	Baayyee guddaa ture.
Not sure here.	Asitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
He was walking to the bar	Gara mana dhugaatii sanaa deemaa ture
What you love most and why you love it.	Waan baay'ee jaallattu fi maaliif akka jaallattu.
This must be a great job.	Kun hojii guddaa ta'uu qaba.
Not so much today.	Har'a hangas miti.
No one else can be you.	Namni biraa si ta'uu hin danda'u.
They'll be good for you out there.	Isaan achi keessaa gaarii siif ta'u.
I didn’t know any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku ture
That thing isn’t going away.	Wanti sun hin deemu.
I would never have any issues	Silaa gonkumaa dhimma tokkollee hin qabu ture
He wasn’t in the room.	Kutaa keessa hin turre.
Really happy for him.	Dhuguma isaaf gammade.
I didn't tell him why.	Maaliif akka ta'e itti hin himne.
You don't want to help me.	Na gargaaruu hin barbaaddu.
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
It would be just another two days.	Silaa guyyaa lama kan biraa qofa ta'a.
A bad day.	Guyyaa hamaa.
I had to do it yesterday	Kaleessa gochuun qaba ture
Look at this.	Kana ilaalaa.
But that didn’t matter anymore.	Garuu kana booda sun barbaachisaa hin turre.
I know what he doesn’t know	Waan inni hin beekne nan beeka
I meant nothing by that	Kana jechuun homaa jechuu koo hin turre
It's going to be a lot.	Baay'ee ta'a.
I was sure it wasn't an accident.	Balaa akka hin taane mirkanaa'aa ture.
That was me at my worst	Sun ani yeroo hamaa kootti ture
That's just not happening.	Sun ta'aa hin jiru qofa.
But so far nothing had come of it.	Garuu hanga ammaatti wanti irraa dhufe hin turre.
None of them spoke	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin dubbanne
I had no idea what was ahead of me	Waan na dura jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
We are outside.	Nuti ala jirra.
I doubt anyone would say that now	Amma namni akkas jedhu jira jedheen shakka
I wanted to do more with him tonight	Halkan kana isa waliin kana caalaa hojjechuu barbaade
That's not what happened.	Kan ta'e akkas miti.
I never understood this	Kana yoomiyyuu naaf hin galle
You can’t eat without it.	Isa malee nyaachuu hin dandeessu.
We are on the road.	Karaa irra jirra.
Not my mother though.	Haadha koo miti garuu.
From a long way off.	Karaa dheeraa irraa.
I don't even know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
I wondered what would happen	Maal ta'a jedheen yaade
But he doesn't.	Garuu hin godhu.
We still can't.	Ammallee hin dandeenyu.
I think I should talk about it	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu qaba jedheen yaada
This is not an idea.	Kun yaada miti.
I want to know more	Kana caalaa beekuu barbaada
There is one thing he doesn't want, though.	Inni hin barbaanne tokko jira garuu.
But we need your help!.	Garuu gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa!.
Good luck next year	Carraa gaarii bara dhufu
I want your children	Ijoollee keessan nan barbaada
Just a little bit now it works.	Xiqqoo qofa amma ni hojjeta.
We are still here.	Ammallee as jirra.
That can be a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I couldn’t see her	Ishee arguu hin dandeenye
You were just you.	Ati si qofa turte.
Now he says to himself.	Amma ofitti akkas jedha.
It was all here.	Hundi isaa asitti ture.
I mean, look at it.	Mee ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
I always thought it was just about me.	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee koo qofa jedheen yaada ture.
It wasn’t an issue.	Dhimma hin turre.
Been here for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf as ture.
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I really didn’t know.	Dhuguma hin beeku ture.
He becomes everything, no one else becomes anything.	Inni waan hundumaa ta'a, namni biraa homaa hin ta'u.
So I think we got along pretty well	Kanaaf akka gaariitti kan walii galle natti fakkaata
Not just now.	Amma qofa miti.
I should know better	Ani caalaatti beekuu qaba
She was looking at me, not him.	Isheen isa osoo hin taane na ilaalaa turte.
I think it’s easiest that way.	Akkasitti hunda caalaa salphaa natti fakkaata.
This is my job.	Kun hojii kooti.
We are going where no one has gone before.	Bakka kanaan dura namni hin deemne deemaa jirra.
He did this only once.	Kana yeroo tokko qofa godhe.
Which you know.	Kan ati beektu.
I would never have done that to you	Silaa yoomiyyuu akkas si hin godhu ture
He must go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qaba.
She doesn't know anything.	Isheen homaa hin beektu.
So go back home.	Kanaaf gara manaatti deebi'i.
You knew he was there, of course.	Akka inni achi jiru beekta turte, beekamaadha.
I’m still working on it	Ammas irratti hojjechaa jira
But that wasn’t right.	Garuu sun sirrii hin turre.
I just really like it.	Ani baay'ee natti tola qofa.
To be great.	Guddaa ta'uuf.
I don't think so.	Akkas miti jedheen yaada.
Which is a possibility.	Kan ta'uu danda'u.
I could say both of these	Kana lamaan jechuu nan danda'a ture
A little but not too much	Xiqqoo garuu baay'ee miti
Glad she had it.	Isheen akka qabdu gammade.
I was just doing my job	Hojii koo qofa hojjechaa ture
He wanted me to love it so, so badly.	Akkas, akka malee akkan jaalladhu barbaade.
I thought maybe you could suggest something.	Tarii waan tokko yaada kennuu dandeessa jedheen yaade.
Maybe you did, but you didn't tell me.	Tarii ni beekta ta'a, garuu natti hin himne.
But one thing was wrong.	Wanti tokko garuu dogoggora ture.
I didn’t see him in a week	Torban tokko booda isa hin argine
I didn’t know he had it in him	Isa keessa akka qabu hin beeku ture
Many of them.	Baay'ee isaanii.
I can do it quickly.	Dafee hojjechuu nan danda'a.
That's what it might be.	Kana ta'uu danda'a.
Someone loves you.	Namni si jaallata.
I thought it was pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate.
I didn’t want to leave her alone in the car	Konkolaataa keessa kophaa ishee dhiisuu hin barbaanne
I couldn't have done better	Kana caalaa hojjechuu hin danda'u ture
I think he was right.	Inni sirrii ture natti fakkaata.
This week.	Torban kun.
I think about it a lot.	Baay'een itti yaada.
Sorry, but that's how it should be.	Dhiifama garuu akkas ta'uu qaba.
There he saw something else.	Achitti waan biraa arge.
Sometimes it happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni ta'a.
I was very happy at that moment.	Yeroo sanatti baay'een gammade.
I think it must be something else	Waan biraa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
It was really like that.	Dhuguma akkas ture.
He knew then what he intended to do.	Waan inni gochuuf yaade yeroo sana beeka ture.
Within a month.	Ji'a tokko keessatti.
But I could do it	Ani garuu gochuu nan dandaʼa ture
It just can't be that way.	Akkas qofa ta'uu hin danda'u.
This can be a great thing.	Kun waan guddaa ta’uu danda’a.
But it’s not the only way.	Garuu karaa kana qofa miti.
Something about that mattered.	Waaʼee sanaa wanti tokko barbaachisaa ture.
Not when you have the time and desire.	Yeroo fi fedhii yeroo qabdu miti.
Only two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama qofa.
I was never able to give myself completely.	Guutummaatti of kennuu gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
I quickly saw that something was different at work	Hojii irratti wanti adda taʼe akka taʼe dafee arge
I wish it were.	Osoo ta'ee natti tola.
The issue of forgiveness.	Dhimma dhiifama.
I did not know what it was	Maal akka taʼe hin beeku ture
I want to work with you	Si waliin hojjechuu barbaada
I suspect he wasn’t telling the truth.	Dhugaa hin dubbanne jedheen shakka.
I wasn’t around	Ani naannoo sana hin turre
I like that part better.	Kutaa sana caalaatti natti tola.
Real people with real lives.	Namoota dhugaa jireenya dhugaa qaban.
I didn't know what it was except for something	Waan tokko malee maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I don't think so.	Ani natti hin fakkaatu.
I'm going to help you.	Si gargaaruuf deema.
He was a guy you knew well.	Gurbaa ati sirriitti beektu ture.
We have great things with our little room.	Kutaa keenya xiqqoo waliin waan guddaa qabna.
You will always love your children.	Yeroo hundumaa ijoollee keessan ni jaallattu.
I want you to do something	Waan tokko akka gootu nan barbaada
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
I really want that to happen again	Ammas akkas ta'uu baay'een barbaada
I need to go.	Deemuun na barbaachisa.
I don't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
This can’t be you.	Kun si ta’uu hin danda’u.
I wasn't sure what was right at the time	Yeroo sanatti waan sirrii ta'e tokko mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I want to know how to do this.	Kana akkamitti akkan godhu beekuu barbaada.
I was very happy where I went	Bakka deemuu kootti baay'een gammade
He even thought it could be more than one	Tokko ol ta'uu danda'a jedhee illee yaade
It was always clear.	Yeroo hundumaa ifa ture.
That's it.	Kana moo.
They weren’t human.	Isaan nama hin turre.
You are so good.	Ati akka malee gaarii dha.
I know it was bad for him	Isaaf hamaa akka ture nan beeka
Boy, it was great.	Gurbaa, guddaa ture.
Neither of us said anything.	Lamaan keenyayyuu homaa hin dubbanne.
I didn't want to think	Yaadu hin barbaanne
Still no one came.	Ammas namni dhufe hin jiru.
I don't have anything.	Ani homaa hin qabu.
But today I doubt anyone will come	Har'a garuu namni dhufu akka jiru nan shakka
I'm on the road.	Ani karaa irra jira.
Everything seemed bigger than it should have been.	Wanti hundi waan ta'uu qabu caalaa guddaa fakkaata ture.
I wouldn’t have wanted to do that	Silaa akkas gochuu hin barbaadu ture
I'm not saying that's the case.	Akkas ta'a hin jedhu.
It’s on everything.	Waan hundumaa irra jira.
Not sure though.	Mirkanaa'aa miti garuu.
It was a house I hadn’t seen before	Mana kanaan dura hin argine ture
I love that.	Sana nan jaalladha.
Now it’s in my hands.	Amma harka koo keessa jira.
I didn’t know these people	Namoota kana hin beeku ture
I didn’t want them there.	Achitti isaan hin barbaanne.
I think it can go a long way	Karaa dheeraa deemuu danda'a jedheen yaada
The problem seems to be similar in this case.	Rakkoon jiru dhimma kanaan wal fakkaata fakkaata.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
It will be true.	Dhugaa ta'a.
I couldn’t do it alone	Kophaa koo gochuu hin dandeenye
But that couldn't happen.	Garuu sun ta'uu hin dandeenye.
But I still don’t understand.	Garuu ammallee hin hubanne.
Very well, he had to go.	Baayyee gaarii, deemuu qaba ture.
He must know everything that is going on	Waan deemaa jiru hunda beekuu qaba
Doing a very good job.	Hojii baayyee gaarii hojjechuu.
As this work happens.	Akkuma hojiin kun ta'u.
I hoped he wouldn’t notice	Akka hin hubanne abdiin qaba ture
Where everyone knows everyone else.	Bakka namni hundi nama hunda beeku.
But it was never easy.	Garuu gonkumaa salphaa hin turre.
I have to take a chance.	Carraa gochuun qaba.
Man needs a job	Namni hojii barbaada
I wasn’t expecting you so soon	Akkas dafee si eegaa hin turre
Maybe, I thought.	Tarii jedheen yaade.
Eventually I knew it was working	Yeroo booda hojjechaa akka jiru nan beeka ture
I don't think you can.	Ni dandeessu natti hin fakkaatu.
I can't do this all day	Guyyaa guutuu kana gochuu hin danda'u
He couldn’t do that again	Ammas akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
Like his father.	Akkuma abbaa isaa.
He was waiting for you.	Si eegaa ture.
But it’s not the only one.	Garuu isa qofa miti.
I didn’t go with her	Ani ishee waliin hin deemne
I knew this was all new to him	Kun hundi isaaf haaraa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
It had to be in her.	Ishee keessa ta'uu qaba ture.
He needed something.	Waan tokko isa barbaachisa ture.
Can't find one there	Tokko achitti argachuu hin danda'u
But we’re the only ones.	Garuu nuti qofa.
I hope it goes well today	Har'a akka gaariitti akka deemu abdiin qaba
But he tried.	Garuu yaale.
They only have one problem.	Rakkoo tokko qofa qaban.
Now, not so much.	Amma, hangas miti.
So we did that.	Kanaaf akkas goone.
I want you in my arms every night	Halkan halkan harka kootti si barbaada
Later, he wondered why he did it.	Booda, maaliif akkas godhe jedhee yaade.
I wanted everything she wanted to give me	Waan isheen naaf kennuu barbaaddu hunda nan barbaada ture
Please wait a moment.	Mee yeroo muraasa eegaa.
Much will be needed	Waan baay'een ni barbaachisa
I didn't know much about it	Waa'ee kanaa waan baay'ee hin beeku ture
We didn't even talk for very long.	Baayyee yeroo dheeraa illee hin dubbanne.
That's what I mean.	Akkas jechuu kooti.
I know you’re in there	Achi keessa akka jirtu nan beeka
No one else was with us.	Namni biraa nu waliin hin turre.
But I haven’t seen any issues with that yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti dhimma sanaa tokkollee hin argine.
It doesn’t have anyone.	Nama hin qabu.
I still have a lot of opportunities.	Ammallee carraa baay'een qaba.
If you don't understand, it's okay.	Yoo siif hin galle rakkoo hin qabu.
That's all I can say.	Hanga kana qofa jechuu danda'a.
I think it’s just fine	Ani waan gaarii qofa natti fakkaata
I just couldn’t help myself	Of gargaaruu qofa hin dandeenye
I need your insides	Keessa kee na barbaachisa
He wants to talk about us	Waa'ee keenya dubbachuu barbaada
But he says so much.	Hanga kana garuu ni jedha.
He had the same clothes	Uffata wal fakkaatu qaba ture
I’m not sure that’s right.	Sun sirrii ta’uu isaa mirkanaa’aa miti.
I love them together	Waliin isaanii baay'een jaalladha
But I didn't have it	Ani garuu hin qabu ture
I just didn’t know the language	Afaan sana qofa hin beeku ture
He knew it looked good.	Gaarii akka fakkaatu ni beeka ture.
I didn't want that to happen	Akkas ta'uu hin barbaanne
We didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akka goonu hin beekne.
I knew something special was happening here	Asitti wanti adda taʼe tokko akka taʼe nan beeka ture
Now, that seems unlikely.	Amma, akkas waan hin taane fakkaata.
He was alone for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf kophaa isaa ture.
It’s not for you.	Siif miti.
But you can’t do that.	Garuu akkas gochuu hin dandeessu.
I don’t want to be here at all	Ani tasumaa as jiraachuu hin barbaadu
You have a great voice.	Sagalee guddaa qabda.
I don't think of anyone but you.	Si malee nama biraa hin yaadu.
Perhaps they even are.	Tarii illee taʼuu dandaʼu.
We have to believe in ourselves.	Ofitti amanuu qabna.
It really never works well though.	Dhuguma garuu gonkumaa akka gaariitti hin hojjetu.
That doesn't seem to be the case today.	Sun har'a waan ta'e hin fakkaatu.
There is no one.	Namni hin jiru.
But we had to do it before that.	Garuu sana dura hojjechuu qabna turre.
We never seem to have enough time together.	Yeroo gahaa waliin qabnu gonkumaa hin fakkaatu.
I mean, you know where	Eessa akka ta'e beektaa jechuu kooti
I just need to live a little	Xiqqoo jiraachuu qofa na barbaachisa
But they were there when it wasn’t.	Garuu yeroo hin taane achi turan.
This doesn't sound like much.	Kun waan baay'ee hin fakkaatu.
It was right there.	Sirriitti achi ture.
I hadn’t seen them until then.	Hanga sanatti isaan hin argine ture.
I looked around.	Anis naannoo koo ilaale.
He was great.	Inni guddaa ture.
But she said none of this.	Isheen garuu waan kana keessaa tokkollee hin dubbanne.
He is here to help me.	Inni na gargaaruuf as jira.
She said it worked well tomorrow.	Boru akka gaariitti hojjete jette.
But he doesn’t seem to think we understand.	Garuu waan nuti hubanne waan itti fakkaate hin fakkaatu.
Good times they already had.	Yeroo gaarii isaan duraan qaban.
I can't believe he just said that	Akkas qofa jedhe amanuu hin danda'u
I didn't see her.	Ishee hin argine.
You know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru ni beekta.
You know, you shouldn’t do that.	Beektaa akkas gochuu hin qabdu.
I think that should have happened.	Sun ta'uu qaba ture jedheen yaada.
It will be clear with you.	Si waliin ifa ta'a.
I didn’t see where he went	Bakka inni deeme hin argine
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
Returning to the house.	Gara manaatti deebi'uu.
I saw the same thing	Anis kanuma arge
He went to him.	Gara isaatti deeme.
You always can.	Yeroo hundumaa ni dandeessa.
He was evil.	Inni hamaa ture.
I can't do it, not anyone else	Ani gochuu hin danda'u, nama biraa miti
That was the real voice, not his.	Sun sagalee dhugaa ture malee kan isaa miti.
He doesn’t do any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin godhu.
I don't want this place.	Bakka kana hin barbaadu.
Name !.	Maqaa !.
I don’t know why you think you need one	Maaliif tokko si barbaachisa jettee yaaddu hin beeku
I think they are doing well for me here.	Asitti waan gaarii naaf hojjechaa jiru natti fakkaata.
You just need to believe in yourself.	Ofitti amanuu qofa si barbaachisa.
That might help.	Sun gargaaruu dandaʼa.
Tell me you still have no money.	Ammas qarshii hin qabdu natti himi.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Dogoggora hin turre.
It was just an idea	Yaada qofa ture
They looked pretty great.	Isaan baayyee guddaa fakkaatu turan.
They are not needed.	Isaan hin barbaachisu.
I just have to have it.	Qaba qofa qaba.
He does not know that there is anyone but himself.	Ofii isaa malee namni akka jiru hin beeku.
I hope he knows this	Kana akka beeku abdiin qaba
I wouldn't be here otherwise.	Osoo akkas ta'ee as hin ta'u ture.
That's never been an issue for him.	Sun dhimma isaaf ta'ee hin beeku.
But it is only a matter of time.	Garuu dhimma yeroo qofa.
Hope this helps you out.	Kun akka si gargaaru abdii qabna.
You should never do it.	Gonkumaa hojjechuu hin qabdu.
It is not a good idea to do this.	Kana gochuun yaada gaarii miti.
They have one daughter	Intala tokko qabu
But we are trying.	Garuu yaalaa jirra.
I mean, you can see what she looks like	Maal akka fakkaattu arguu dandeessa jechuu kooti
We have to speak up.	Dubbachuu qabna.
He has a wife and three children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee sadii qaba.
It doesn’t require much food.	Nyaata baay’ee hin barbaadu.
Everything is fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii dha.
Seems easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata.
And yet it happened.	Ammas ta'ee.
We are here to help.	Gargaaruuf as jirra.
I know you still have it.	Ammallee akka qabdu nan beeka.
I just love you so much	Baay'ee si jaalladha qofa
Not now but soon.	Amma hin taane yeroo dhiyootti.
I knew that was the case	Akkas akka ta'e nan beeka ture
I thought this was a little too simple	Kun xiqqoo garmalee salphaa natti fakkaate
I can tell you think about them all the time	Yeroo hunda waa'ee isaanii akka yaaddu sitti himuu nan danda'a
It was all wrong, of course.	Hundi isaa dogoggora akka ture beekamaadha.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
Walking on the road.	Karaa irra deemuu.
To be perfect again.	Ammas guutuu ta'uuf.
And he did so.	Akkas godhe.
He went up to the back	Duubatti ol ba'e
I think this is a great idea	Kun yaada guddaa natti fakkaata
You don't know that for sure.	Sana mirkanaa'aa hin beektu.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
But it was necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa ture.
Her hands, his hands.	Harka ishee, harka isaa.
I have to go to the hospital tonight	Halkan kana mana yaalaa deemuun qaba
I don't know anything about it	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku
You can’t do anything for me.	Ati waan tokkollee naaf gochuu hin dandeessu.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Waan tokko jechuu miti.
I'm very interested in what I think	Waan yaadu baay'een fedhii qaba
I thought she didn't seem sure she was there.	Achi akka jirtu waan mirkanaa'aa hin fakkaatu natti fakkaate.
Except, there was none, not anymore.	Malee, tokkollee hin turre, kana booda hin turre.
That it doesn’t happen.	Akka hin taane.
More needs to be done.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu barbaachisa.
They are not the same.	Isaan tokko miti.
I once knew this man	Yeroo tokko nama kana beeka ture
You didn’t do anything.	Ati homaa hin goone.
I have no home without him	Isa malee mana hin qabu
I hope all turns out well	Hundi akka gaariitti akka ta'u abdiin qaba
He still had much to do	Ammas waan baayʼee hojjechuu qabu ture
She was in it.	Isheen keessa turte.
It was bright.	Ifa ture.
You know this, you know.	Ati kana beekta.
I don't want that to happen here	Asitti akkas akka ta'u hin barbaadu
I didn't want to stay there any longer than necessary	Yeroo barbaachisaa ta'e caalaa achi turuu hin barbaanne
He was here somewhere.	Inni bakka tokko as ture.
I think it's a good thing.	Waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
No one knew why.	Maaliif akka ta'e namni beeku hin turre.
I thought about that one a lot.	Isa sanaa baay'een yaade.
Then maybe.	Sana booda tarii.
It was all good stuff.	Hundi isaa waan gaarii ture.
He couldn't help it	Gargaaruu hin dandeenye ture
But neither of them happened.	Garuu lamaan isaaniiyyuu hin taane.
It’s not him.	Isa miti.
I can totally do that	Guutummaatti akkas gochuu nan danda'a
You have a lot in common.	Waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu qabdu.
Too much of his father in him.	Garmalee abbaa isaa isa keessa.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
You know why you love it.	Maaliif akka jaallattu ni beekta.
I just couldn’t go.	Ani qofa deemuu hin dandeenye.
You have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
Seems easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata.
Such a simple picture.	Suuraa salphaa akkasii.
This is right.	Kun sirrii dha.
That's what it might be.	Kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
The moment of danger was now.	Yeroon balaa amma ture.
I have to go for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf deemuun qaba
I want him here with me.	Asitti na waliin isa barbaada.
That's a lot for you to do.	Sun waan baay'ee siif gochuu qabda.
It’s the only thing we can do.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu qofa.
He was good at this.	Kana irratti ga’umsa qaba ture.
I need your help now	Gargaarsa keessan amma barbaada
I mean, it's obvious what it is.	Maal akka ta'e ifaadha jechuu kooti.
I hadn’t spoken to him.	Ani itti hin dubbanne ture.
I don't mean to say	Jechuu jechuu koo miti
I love that about him.	Waa'ee isaa akkasitti nan jaalladha.
It wasn't much.	Baay'ee hin turre.
It has to work.	Hojjechuu qaba.
I was great at my job	Hojii koo irratti guddaa ture
I like it here.	Asitti natti tola.
I was happy for him.	Isaaf gammade.
It didn't matter much.	Baay'ee dhimma hin qabu ture.
I don't know any of their names	Maqaa isaanii tokko illee hin beeku
I loved my father.	Abbaa koo nan jaalladha ture.
It happens on its own.	Ofii isaatiin ta'a.
He didn’t know what to do with his hands.	Harka isaatiin maal akka godhu hin beekne.
I don't know the truth about the past	Waa'ee darbe dhugaa hin beeku
But this is not very clear.	Garuu kun baayyee ifa miti.
You know it, you know.	Ni beekta.
I can't do anything	Ani homaa gochuu hin danda'u
I wish he was with us today.	Har'a osoo nu waliin ta'ee natti tola.
We had a new home.	Mana haaraa qabna turre.
I think everyone did everything they could have done.	Namni hundi waan silaa gochuu danda'u hunda hojjete jedheen yaada.
Didn't do very well.	Baay'ee gaarii hin hojjenne.
He looked at what he was going to do.	Maal akka godhu ilaale.
They looked like humans.	Nama fakkaatu turan.
I couldn't tell you.	Sitti himuu hin dandeenye.
This is almost always obvious.	Kun yeroo hunda jechuun ni danda’ama ifaadha.
Luckily, of course.	Carraa akka ta'e beekamaadha.
I didn’t know what that was like, to do that	Sun maal akka fakkaatu hin beeku ture, akkas gochuuf
I don’t fully understand it, but there, it’s not there	Guutummaatti naaf hin galle, garuu achi, achi hin jiru
She needed it too much.	Garmalee ishee barbaachisa ture.
I hope he hasn’t gone yet	Ammallee akka hin deemne abdiin qaba
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
I still want to be around.	Ammallee naannoo koo jiraachuu barbaada.
I want this to be about me	Kun waa'ee koo akka ta'u nan barbaada
He eats without any issues.	Dhimma tokko malee nyaata.
I didn’t see her do that.	Isheen akkas gootu hin argine.
Should come around in the morning.	Ganama naannoo dhufuu qaba.
Again, there was no one like him.	Ammas namni akka isaa hin turre.
Maybe you have it.	Tarii qabda ta'a.
We had an idea.	Yaada qabna turre.
I looked over at her	Anis gara biraa ishee ilaale
I think it’s my favorite.	Kan ani jaalladhu natti fakkaata.
It's different when it's your job.	Yeroo hojii kee ta'u adda.
you should ask yourself.	keessan gaafachuu qabdu.
But you have a book.	Garuu kitaaba qabda.
I can't help myself anymore	Kana booda of gargaaruu hin danda'u
I have a bad feeling about it	Waa'ee kanaa miira hamaa qaba
A lot of it is really good stuff	Baay'een isaa dhuguma waan gaarii dha
This would be right now.	Kun amma sirrii ta’a.
Not just us, but everyone.	Nu qofa osoo hin taane, nama hunda.
I didn't want to be like him	Ani akka isaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
Not really.	Dhuguma miti.
It was a bar.	Mana dhugaatii ture.
Rather than living without each other.	Wal malee jiraachuu irra.
Mine, not yours.	Kan koo malee kan kee miti.
I have no idea where it is.	Eessa akka jiru yaada hin qabu.
But why are you so interested now.	Garuu amma maaliif akkas fedhii qabda.
Another and then another.	Kan biraa sana booda kan biraa.
I am not the person you want me to be	Ani nama ati akkan ta'u barbaaddu miti
I can't find anything else for it.	Wanti biraa itti argachuu hin danda'u.
I know they never are.	Isaan gonkumaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
I sure hope it does.	Akka ta'u abdiin qaba jedheen mirkanaa'adha.
She had no idea what she wanted to ask.	Waan gaafachuu barbaaddu yaada hin qabdu turte.
I never could.	Ani gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
You can’t just eat one.	Tokko qofa nyaachuu hin dandeessu.
I mean, talking about the kids	Waa'ee ijoollee dubbachuu jechuu kooti
It must be one guy.	Gurbaa tokko ta'uu qaba.
I shouldn’t have said anything	Silaa homaa dubbachuu hin qabu ture
I wanted to be like them	Anis akkuma isaanii ta'uu barbaade
It wasn’t going very well.	Baayyee gaarii hin deemu ture.
Then he told her who he was.	Sana booda eenyu akka ta'e itti hime.
If he does, he makes a serious mistake.	Yoo akkas godhe dogoggora guddaa hojjeta.
There was no one in the house but me.	Mana keessa ana malee namni hin turre.
I can't do it without you.	Si malee gochuu hin danda'u.
Then his hands.	Sana booda harka isaa.
I can tell you that much.	Hamma sana sitti himuu danda'a.
If you haven't seen it, you must.	Yoo hin argine ta'e dirqama.
I have a lot of questions.	Gaaffii baay'ee qaba.
But we weren't.	Nuti garuu hin turre.
He really loves you, you know.	Inni dhuguma si jaallata, beekta.
There is no problem with either of these.	Kana lamaan rakkoon hin jiru.
I love it so much.	Baay'een jaalladha.
I couldn't believe what just happened	Waan amma ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
One couldn’t help but recognize her.	Namni tokko ishee beekuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
I mean, look at my mom	Haadha koo ilaalaa jechuu kooti
They have three children.	Ijoollee sadii qabu.
But now I can't seem to get it to work.	Amma garuu akka hojjetu gochuu waanan hin dandeenye fakkaata.
Some good ideas.	Yaada gaarii tokko tokko.
Then he asked me to leave	Sana booda akkan deemu na gaafate
I still think about her.	Ammallee waa'ee ishee nan yaada.
Everything was going well.	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti deemaa ture.
I have nothing bad to say about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan hamaa jedhu hin qabu.
The timing will never be right.	Yeroon sun gonkumaa sirrii hin ta'u.
One of them was a girl.	Isaan keessaa tokko intala tokko turte.
This was his time.	Yeroon kun yeroo isaa ture.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
I don’t want to.	Hin barbaadu.
I had to do this	Kana gochuun qaba ture
I go with my wife and two kids.	Haadha manaa koo fi ijoollee koo lama waliin nan deema.
Way.	Karaa.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
I think that could work	Sun hojjechuu danda'a jedheen yaada
I want you, I want you	Si barbaada, si barbaada
I told him not to.	Anis akka hin goone itti hime.
We are here for you.	Siif as jirra.
People need to get to know them better.	Namoonni caalaatti isaan beekuu qabu.
He is them, not himself.	Inni isaan malee ofii isaa miti.
They were like that.	Isaan akkas turan.
I don’t know how many but some.	Meeqa hin beeku garuu tokko tokko.
I really have to go now	Dhuguma amma deemuun qaba
She said she didn't.	Hin goone jette.
Tell me who did this.	Kana kan godhe eenyu akka ta'e natti himi.
She shouldn't have said anything	Silaa homaa isheen jechuu hin qabu ture
I need a little bit of that	Sana keessaa xiqqoo na barbaachisa
He had an issue.	Dhimma qaba ture.
He said it wouldn't happen.	Hin ta'u jedhe.
I can't stay here.	As turuu hin danda'u.
The cat and the dog.	Saree fi saree.
That would never happen.	Sun gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
You had to know when enough was enough.	Yoom gahaa akka ta'e beekuu qabda turte.
After that, everything else becomes somewhat easier.	Sana booda wanti biraa hundi hamma tokko salphaa ta'a.
I think you're good for him	Ati isaaf gaarii natti fakkaata
I shouldn't have said it	Silaa jechuu hin qabu ture
We have two.	Lama qabna.
I still have no food.	Ammallee nyaata hin qabu.
It was good, really good.	Gaarii ture, dhuguma gaarii ture.
I didn’t know what to say at the time	Yeroo sanatti maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
I was looking for him	Ani isa barbaadaa ture
I knew it really wasn’t.	Dhuguma akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
We stayed right by her.	Sirriitti ishee bira turre.
He’s the only one.	Inni qofa.
This is a possibility.	Kun ta’uu danda’a.
I love that idea	Yaada sana baay'een jaalladha
It was the best one.	Isa gaarii ture.
Certainly not twice.	Yeroo lama akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I haven’t gone for three weeks	Torban sadii hin deemne
That was a real person.	Sun nama dhugaa taʼe ture.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
But I was very happy	Ani garuu baay'een gammade
Moreover	Caalaatti .
I seriously need to go	Ani akka malee deemuun na barbaachisa
I think what you said is extremely important.	Wanti ati jette garmalee barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
She became a joke.	Qoosaa taate.
It looked different now.	Amma adda fakkaata ture.
Then I started coming to.	Sana booda gara dhufuu jalqabe.
I didn’t think it was my idea anymore	Kana booda yaada koo natti hin fakkaatu ture
You were the only one.	Ati qofa turte.
But she was real.	Garuu isheen dhugaa turte.
Everyone is looking at her.	Hundi ishee ilaalaa jiru.
Glad to see him	Isa arguu kootti gammadeera
She was too young.	Isheen garmalee xiqqoo turte.
I would have no way of knowing	Silaa karaa itti beeku hin qabu ture
I never wanted to have it	Yoomiyyuu qabaachuu hin barbaanne
I think he just doesn’t care	Inni dhimma hin qabne qofa natti fakkaata
He shouldn't have been in them.	Silaa isaan keessa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
Then you can go on your way.	Sana booda karaa kee deemuu dandeessa.
I have a lot to say about him.	Waa'ee isaa waanan jedhu baay'ee qaba.
Many of them.	Baay'ee isaanii.
Now, it works.	Amma, ni hojjeta.
I still can't believe what's happening	Ammallee waan ta'aa jiru amanuu hin danda'u
Now we are friends.	Amma hiriyyoota taane.
No one else seems to have it.	Namni biraa waan qabu hin fakkaatu.
He even said that.	Inni illee akkas jedhe.
It shouldn’t stay on	Irra turuu hin qabu
It won't be great anymore.	Kana booda guddaa hin ta'u.
He’s making such a big deal out of nothing.	Homaa irraa waan guddaa akkasii hojjechaa jira.
I was with them all morning	Ganama guutuu isaan waliin ture
It's going to be a part.	Kutaa ta'uuf deema.
I really can't.	Dhuguma hin danda'u.
If it happened, it had to happen.	Yoo ta'e ta'uu qaba ture.
He already knew this.	Kana duruu beeka ture.
I don’t know the hand.	Harka hin beeku.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
They don’t interact with each other	Waliin wal hin qaban
But a little bit.	Garuu xiqqoo.
He went quickly.	Dafee deeme.
She shouldn’t see me.	Isheen na arguu hin qabdu.
Someone else made it happen.	Namni biraa akkas akka ta'u godhe.
But you don't have it.	Garuu hin qabdu.
You have to be willing.	Fedhii qabaachuu qabda.
Better be there when she does.	Yeroo isheen gootu achi jiraachuu wayya.
We can’t have anything.	Homaa qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
She really doesn’t like it.	Dhuguma isheen hin jaallattu.
It was this dress.	Uffata kana ture.
But we’re a little different.	Garuu xiqqoo adda taane.
I couldn’t see them	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye ture
He said he knew a guy.	Gurbaa tokko nan beeka jedhe.
I wasn't sure she was even real	Isheen dhugaa illee akka taate mirkanaa'aa hin turre
None of you are there.	Isin keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
It was still early.	Ammallee dafee ture.
Three years later he is gone.	Waggaa sadii booda hin jiru.
He said that.	Akkas jedheera.
As it matters.	Akkuma dhimma qabu.
I knew you had it in you	Si keessa akka qabdu nan beeka ture
I never realized that	Akkas ta'uu isaa gonkumaa hin hubanne
He came twice before	Duraan yeroo lama dhufe
Very good condition.	Haala baayyee gaarii dha.
This is very, very, very wrong.	Kun baayyee baayyee baayyee dogoggora.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
I can tell you something.	Waan tokko sitti himuu nan danda'a.
But I like it	Ani garuu natti tola
It’s not going to.	Deemu miti.
I didn’t want to be around him	Naannoo isaa jiraachuu hin barbaanne
But I didn’t think things through.	Garuu waan tokko sirriitti hin yaadne.
Today is different.	Har'a adda.
This is going to happen.	Kun ta'uuf deema.
Just doing their job.	Hojii isaanii qofa hojjechuu.
I didn't see how anyone could.	Namni tokko akkamitti akka danda'u hin argine.
He’s doing just fine.	Inni akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
Maybe he should have	Tarii qabaachuu qaba ture
I can't stay there any longer	Kana booda achi turuu hin danda'u
He was like that.	Inni akkas ture.
It looked pretty bad.	Baayyee hamaa fakkaata ture.
It doesn’t matter that much.	Hanga kana dhimma hin qabu.
There is no other.	Kan biraa hin jiru.
But it’s just not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti qofa.
I think it’s one of my best	Ani waan gaarii koo keessaa tokko natti fakkaata
Where to go.	Bakka deemuuf.
I wasn’t supposed to see them again	Ammas isaan arguu hin qabu ture
So he’s doing fine on his own.	Kanaaf ofuma isaatiin gaarii hojjechaa jira.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
But there it was, exactly what he needed.	Garuu achi ture, sirriitti waan isa barbaachisu.
I want him there.	Achitti isa barbaada.
I really wanted to know about this	Waa'ee kanaa baay'een beekuu barbaade
He asked what he had said.	Maal jedhe gaafate.
Still not a problem.	Ammas rakkoo miti.
I could never go back again	Kana booda gonkumaa duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
He was my husband.	Inni abbaa manaa koo ture.
Their problem is not homelessness.	Rakkoon isaanii mana hin qabne miti.
I think we have a long day tomorrow	Boru guyyaa dheeraa qabna jedheen yaada
I was with him, too.	Anis waliin ture.
I didn’t want to do what anyone else was doing.	Waan namni biraa hojjechaa jiru hojjechuu hin barbaanne.
This is not right, he told himself.	Kun sirrii miti jedhee ofitti dubbate.
But it doesn’t seem to be working.	Garuu waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
No one knew he was going.	Akka deemu namni beeku hin turre.
Everything about him was different	Waa'ee isaa wanti hundi adda ture
It was a good night.	Halkan gaarii ture.
I didn’t want her to do that.	Akka isheen akkas gootu hin barbaanne.
It’s not us.	Nu miti.
This was the one.	Kun isa kana ture.
But maybe they shouldn't be.	Garuu tarii ta'uu hin qaban ta'a.
He was with me.	Na waliin ture.
He knew what was coming.	Waan dhufu ni beeka ture.
There must be some reason.	Sababni tokko tokko jiraachuu qaba.
I need time.	Yeroon na barbaachisa.
I want to give myself completely	Ani guutummaatti of kennuu barbaada
This year everything went his way.	Bara kana wanti hundi karaa isaa deeme.
He didn't go.	Inni hin deemne.
I didn't think about it any more.	Kana caalaa waa'ee kanaa hin yaadne.
They were the only ones out here.	As ala isaan qofa turan.
I didn't know how this could happen	Kun akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku ture
Only three days.	Guyyaa sadii qofa.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
He knew it was irrelevant then.	Inni yeroo sanatti barbaachisaa akka hin taane beeka ture.
I didn’t know you knew him	Akka ati isa beektu hin beeku ture
I was alone this time	Yeroo kana kophaa koo ture
He said he wanted to help	Gargaaruu barbaada jedhe
There are times when you want nothing.	Yeroon ati homaa hin barbaanne jira.
Today, however, he knows little.	Har'a garuu waan xiqqoo beeka.
You have a lot to do with this.	Kana waliin waan hedduu hojjechuu qabda.
If you do, this is for you.	Yoo akkas goote kun siif ta'a.
As much as you know.	Hamma beektu.
I don't know you.	Ani si hin beeku.
It was just about him.	Waa'ee isaa qofa ture.
This may just be the most important one.	Kun isa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe qofa taʼuu dandaʼa.
He wasn't there when it happened.	Yeroo ta'u achi hin turre.
I looked up at him.	Anis ol jedheen isa ilaale.
I wanted to know more about him	Waa'ee isaa caalaatti beekuu barbaade
Good with kids.	Ijoollee wajjin gaarii dha.
I only have one of myself	Ofii koo keessaa tokko qofa qaba
Because it doesn't matter.	Sababni isaa homaa hin qabu.
I know him, he knows me.	Ani isa beeka, inni na beeka.
Your problem is my problem.	Rakkoon keessan rakkoo kooti.
They look like him.	Isa fakkaatu.
There is nowhere to go.	Bakka itti deemu hin jiru.
I didn't want to tell my father about my problem	Rakkoo koo abbaa kootti himuu hin barbaanne
He looked into her eyes	Ija ishee keessa ilaale
I couldn’t quite believe it.	Guutummaatti amanuu hin dandeenye.
I know you mean well	Akka gaariitti akka jechuu kee nan beeka
I thought I’d be better off tonight	Halkan kana naaf wayya jedheen yaade
Nothing like that would happen in our lives.	Wanti akkasii jireenya keenya keessatti hin ta'u ture.
I have been searching for good answers my whole life	Jireenya koo guutuu deebii gaarii barbaadaa tureera
I know it wasn’t all yours, though	Hundi isaa kan kee akka hin turre nan beeka, garuu
I really wanted to see everyone	Nama hunda arguu baay'een barbaade
He must know what is happening	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba
Together they are him.	Waliin isaan isa.
Opportunity to work together	Carraa waliin hojjechuu
It's just the right time.	Yeroo sirrii ta'e qofa.
This doesn't happen often.	Kun yeroo baay'ee hin ta'u.
I don’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akka godhu hin beeku.
We had a chance.	Carraa qabna turre.
But I can't say I have to go.	Garuu deemuu qaba jechuu hin danda'u.
He wouldn’t have done it.	Silaa hin godhu ture.
But nothing really worked.	Garuu dhuguma wanti hojjete hin jiru.
I don't know what it will be but it will work.	Maal akka ta'u hin beeku garuu ni hojjeta.
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf.
I mean this time.	Yeroo kana jechuu kooti.
He came out here to be alone	Kophaa ta'uuf as ba'e
Every night was more special.	Halkan hundi caalaatti adda ture.
I should never have said that	Silaa gonkumaa akkas jechuu hin qabu ture
I like that very much.	Sun baayʼee natti tola.
This was going to be a big deal.	Kun waan guddaa ta'uuf ture.
It took him a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa itti fudhate.
I can be back here in two days	Guyyaa lama booda as deebi'uu nan danda'a
You never have to do it again.	Kana booda gonkumaa gochuu hin qabdu.
I have a completely different opinion	Ani yaada guutummaatti adda ta'e qaba
It is not a duty.	Dirqama miti.
Now it works without any problems.	Amma rakkoo tokko malee hojjeta.
So much for that.	Kanaaf baay'ee.
It worked for me.	Naaf hojjete.
I didn’t want to believe him	Isa amanuu hin barbaanne
You can see this in the picture.	Kana suuraa irratti arguu dandeessu.
I don’t want anything, I don’t want anything.	Homaa hin barbaadu, hin barbaadu.
I want my father.	Abbaa koo nan barbaada.
It shouldn’t be like that.	Akkas ta’uu hin qabu.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
I can't be with you anymore	Kana booda si waliin ta'uu hin danda'u
I couldn't believe it was so soon	Dafee akka ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
You are unique.	Ati adda taate.
I love it very, very, very much	Baay'een, baay'een, baay'een jaalladha
It was probably too late, but .	Yeroon sun yeroon isaa darbe taʼuu hin oolu, garuu .
Tonight they were both in the room.	Halkan kana lamaan isaanii kutaa keessa turan.
But I don't like them.	Ani garuu isaan hin jaalladhu.
She was there to do a job.	Hojii hojjechuuf achi turte.
But it looked dangerous.	Garuu balaa kan qabu fakkaata ture.
Some of your time	Yeroo kee keessaa muraasa
He told her he needed to stop drinking	Dhugaatii dhiisuu akka qabu itti hime
They are looking into me.	Na keessaa ilaalaa jiru.
What he does with them, what.	Wanti inni isaan waliin hojjetu, wanti.
He said it wasn't me.	Ani miti jedhe.
But look at this guy.	Garuu gurbaa kana ilaalaa.
I would never have done that	Silaa yoomiyyuu akkas hin godhu ture
I knew this was going to be really bad.	Kun dhuguma hamaa akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
I don’t have to tell you any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee sitti himuu hin qabu
I know he loves you	Akka inni si jaallatu nan beeka
Language is the language.	Afaan jechuun afaan.
But that's exactly what happened.	Garuu sirriitti kanuma ta'e.
That would be completely wrong.	Sun guutummaatti dogoggora ta’a.
I haven’t told my wife yet.	Haadha manaa kootti hanga ammaatti hin himne.
He had to go back.	Deebi'uu qaba ture.
I mean, very few people	Namoota baayyee muraasa jechuu kooti
Meant.	Jechuu barbaade.
I knew he was right.	Sirrii ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture.
He should do so often	Yeroo baayʼee akkas gochuu qaba
I don't know what exactly the reason is.	Sababni isaa sirriitti maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
Much more than it should be	Waan ta'uu qabu caalaa baay'ee
So he came to the hospital.	Kanaaf gara mana yaalaa dhufe.
Where he didn't want to be	Bakka inni ta'uu hin barbaanne
None of them are there.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
Except for the	Kan jedhu malee .
I couldn’t live in my house anymore	Kana booda mana koo keessa jiraachuu hin dandeenye
You never really know, I think.	Dhuguma gonkumaa hin beektu, natti fakkaata.
But not everyone does.	Garuu namni hundi hin godhu.
I need to be forgiven	Dhiifama gochuun na barbaachisa
I didn’t know where else to go	Kan biraa eessa akkan deemu hin beeku ture
I can't do anything about those people	Namoota sanaa homaa gochuu hin danda'u
It happened a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ta'e.
I want to be the one to do that	Ani nama akkas godhu ta'uu barbaada
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
I love them much more than myself	Ofii koo caalaa baay'een isaan jaalladha
It’s always nothing.	Yeroo hundumaa homaa miti.
I had no desire to go anywhere else	Bakka biraa deemuuf fedhii hin qabu ture
I mean, I really love it	Dhuguma jaalladha jechuu kooti
It can't be in the morning.	Ganama ta'uu hin danda'u.
I'll do one for you.	Tokko siif godha.
I just thought it was a joke	Qoosaa qofa natti fakkaate
Most of the time, it doesn't go well.	Yeroo baayyee, akka gaariitti hin deemu.
I shouldn’t do that to her	Ani akkas ishee irratti gochuu hin qabu
It couldn't have been easier.	Silaa kana caalaa salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
That’s what they don’t understand.	Kan isaan hin hubanne kanuma.
Not really saying much else.	Dhuguma waan biraa baay'ee jechuu miti.
You are a good person.	Ati nama gaarii dha.
Didn't do very well.	Baayyee gaarii hin goone.
There were many this time.	Yeroo kana hedduu turan.
I wanted to tell him about it	Waa'ee kanaa itti himuu barbaade
Check that out with them.	Sana isaan waliin ilaalaa.
They may do nothing.	Homaa gochuu dhiisuu dandaʼu.
I’m not saying you can’t	Hin dandeessu jechuu koo miti
One of them did nothing.	Isaan keessaa tokko homaa hin goone.
I want it to happen quickly.	Dafee akka ta'u nan barbaada.
He didn’t even have that	Sana illee hin qabu ture
It is in us.	Nu keessa jira.
I think they could do nothing but help us	Nu gargaaruu malee homaa gochuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
But, it’s time now.	Garuu, yeroon isaa amma.
But he is not like that.	Garuu inni akkas miti.
I really enjoyed your class	Kutaa kee baay'een gammade
I can do that.	Ani akkas gochuu nan danda'a.
I can truly see your father in you	Dhuguma abbaa kee si keessaa arguu nan danda'a
But that wasn't what mattered.	Garuu wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma hin turre.
But I couldn’t find it.	Garuu argachuu hin dandeenye.
He knew what he had to do.	Waan gochuu qabu ni beeka ture.
It went well enough.	Akka gaariitti deeme.
Maybe a little of both.	Tarii xiqqoo lamaan isaanii keessaa.
But that’s not everything.	Garuu sun waan hunda miti.
This is not a problem.	Kun rakkoo miti.
He couldn't go back	Deebi'uu hin dandeenye
But I couldn’t do everything.	Garuu waan hunda gochuu hin dandeenye.
I love these people.	Namoota kana nan jaalladha.
Maybe it's too much.	Tarii garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
I mean real feeling	Miira dhugaa jechuu kooti
A few nights ago.	Halkan muraasa dura.
But it was nothing too obvious.	Garuu waan garmalee ifa ta'e hin turre.
I just didn’t want to give him a chance	Carraa isaaf kennuu qofa hin barbaanne
I love this time of year.	Yeroo waggaa kana baay'een jaalladha.
I didn’t belong to these people	Ani kan namoota kanaa hin turre
I have it here before me	Ani asitti na dura qaba
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
You can go back there, please.	Achitti deebi'uu dandeessa maaloo.
He knew exactly what was waiting for us out there	Waan achi keessaa nu eegaa jiru sirriitti beeka ture
I didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I didn’t want her to live like this.	Akkas jiraachuu akka qabdu hin barbaanne.
There's just no reason for it.	Sababni itti ta'u hin jiru qofa.
He looked much older.	Inni baayʼee umuriin isaa guddaa fakkaata ture.
He had no chance	Carraa tokkollee hin qabu ture
We have to be here.	As ta'uu qabna.
But this morning I saw no one there.	Ganama kana garuu nama achitti hin argine.
You are no different.	Ati adda miti.
I want to go do everything with you	Waan hundumaa si waliin hojjechuuf deemuu barbaada
I didn't know what was right or wrong	Waan sirrii fi dogoggora ta'e hin beeku ture
I can't buy anything right now	Yeroo ammaa kana homaa bitachuu hin danda'u
We are on the road.	Karaa irra jirra.
We are not the same.	Nuti tokko miti.
I have been here a while	Yeroo muraasa as tureera
I couldn't be that person	Ani nama sana ta'uu hin dandeenye
I love you, can you ever forgive me	Si jaalladha, yoomiyyuu dhiifama naaf gochuu dandeessaa
There is a job.	Hojiin tokko jira.
You seem to know a great deal.	Waan guddaa beekta fakkaata.
He is in serious trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa keessa jira.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
I already know enough	Ani duruu gahaa beeka
It was always someone else.	Yeroo hundumaa nama biraa ture.
It doesn’t matter what you think.	Waan yaaddu homaa hin qabu.
I think you know what you’re doing	Waan gootu waan beektu natti fakkaata
That's what he did to me.	Kana na godhe.
There was no one.	Namni hin turre.
This means that the.	Kana jechuun kan.
Throughout.	Guutummaatti.
I need space and time to think	Bakka fi yeroo itti yaadu na barbaachisa
I really thought they were better	Dhuguma isaan kana caalaa natti fakkaate
I can't be with someone	Nama tokko waliin ta'uu hin danda'u
I knew she was in for something	Waan keessa akka jirtu nan beeka ture
But he could not find one.	Tokko garuu argachuu hin dandeenye.
I really wanted a picture of her	Suuraa ishee baay'een barbaade
I don't know if they exist	Jiraachuu isaanii hin beeku
I wanted to see them together.	Waliin isaan arguu barbaade.
It should be completely smooth.	Guutummaatti sirriitti sirriitti ta'uu qaba.
Almost everyone thought so.	Namni hundi jechuun ni danda’ama akkas jedhee yaade.
I saw my opportunity	Carraa koo arge
You can help us.	Nu gargaaruu dandeessu.
This is the reality.	Dhugaa jiru kana.
I don't know who this person is.	Namni kun eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku.
It’s all well and good.	Hundi isaa gaarii fi gaarii dha.
There is nothing.	Homaa hin jiru.
He has it.	Isa qaba.
This was a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii ture.
I hadn’t met them before	Kanaan dura isaan waliin wal hin argine ture
They can say things they can't.	Waan hin dandeenye jechuu danda'u.
I think that's how it should be	Akkas ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
I always loved her parents	Yeroo hundumaa warra ishee nan jaalladha ture
Then he looked at me.	Sana booda na ilaale.
Which she does.	Kan isheen gootu.
We have to go,' he said.	Deemu qabna,' jedhe.
One, you don't want it to be real.	Tokko, dhugaa akka ta'u hin barbaaddu.
But I know what you're going for	Waan deemtu garuu nan beeka
I want to get me one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko naaf argachuu barbaada
I know she’s with you	Isheen si waliin akka jirtu nan beeka
This was not a house.	Kun mana hin turre.
But this was something very different.	Garuu kun waan baayyee adda ta'e ture.
I thought you would be older	Ati umuriin kee guddaa ta'a jedheen yaade
I shouldn’t have left you that long	Silaa hanga sana si dhiisuu hin qabu ture
Someone who tells you who you are.	Nama eenyu akka taate sitti himu.
I didn’t want any big trouble	Rakkoo guddaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
I could help him with that.	Kanaan isa gargaaruu nan dandaʼa ture.
I didn’t have any of them	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin qabne
No one was home at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namni mana ture hin jiru.
Often, they were better.	Yeroo baayʼee, isaan caalaa turan.
It’s a place.	Bakka dha.
I mean everything, just everything.	Hunda, hunda qofa jechuu kooti.
This was true.	Kun dhugaa ture.
Such as this.	Kan akka kanaa.
I didn't know what to say.	Waan jedhu hin beeku ture.
The lives of these children.	Jireenya ijoollee kanaa.
I thought this would be easy	Kun salphaa ta'a jedheen yaade
I don't want this to happen.	Kun akka ta'u hin barbaadu.
I know not everyone can do this	Namni hundi kana gochuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
I can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin danda'u.
I looked up at my mother	Ol jedheen haadha koo ilaale
I suggest you leave now	Amma akka deemtu yaada kooti
I thought of nothing but her	Ishee malee homaa hin yaadne
I knew nothing about this guy.	Waa'ee gurbaa kanaa homaa hin beeku ture.
He had no sleep.	Hirriba hin qabu ture.
He wanted to be clear	Ifa ta'uu barbaade
He had no obligation.	Dirqama hin qabu ture.
You have to do more than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabda.
I won't tell him anything.	Ani homaa itti hin himu.
Tell me, Dad.	Abbaa natti himi.
I wonder what it is about	Waa'ee maali jedheen yaada
No one had told her how to do that.	Akkamitti akkas gootu namni itti hime hin turre.
When he comes to school.	Yeroo mana barumsaa dhufu.
But look at this.	Garuu kana ilaalaa.
What did you say about it.	Waa'ee maal jette.
I told her I was better off without her	Ishee malee naaf wayya jedheen itti hime
I love you completely.	Guutummaatti si jaalladha.
It's not about what you can't do.	Waa'ee waan ati gochuu hin dandeenye miti.
I hope she always did	Yeroo hundumaa akkas gochaa akka turte abdiin qaba
People are looking at you.	Namoonni si ilaalaa jiru.
Everything works fine in the local environment.	Naannoo naannoo keessatti wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I think everyone knows who he is.	Namni hundi eenyu akka ta'e waan beeku natti fakkaata.
Another issue, and perfectly fine.	Dhimma biraa, fi guutummaatti gaarii dha.
His work preceded mine.	Hojiin isaa kan koo dura ture.
No one knew his.	Kan isaa namni beeku hin turre.
That wasn’t true.	Sun dhugaa hin turre.
At that point I thought she couldn’t speak.	Yeroo sanatti dubbachuu hin dandeessu jedheen yaade.
I can't be with you	Si waliin ta'uu hin danda'u
I am so lucky to have you in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti si argachuu kootti baay'een carraa qaba.
I really hope you do	Dhuguma akka isin ta'u abdiin qaba
I want you to go before me	Akka ati na dura deemtu nan barbaada
But it was just a little bit.	Garuu xiqqoo qofa ture.
He had been working on this car before	Konkolaataa kana dura hojjechaa ture
We need to make it all work.	Hundi isaa akka hojjetu gochuu qabna.
It's not me, though.	Ana miti garuu.
Soon, he would say.	Yeroo dhiyootti, jedha ture.
It may not be obvious.	Tarii ifa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I'm going tonight	Halkan kana deemaa jira
I think the chances are pretty good	Carraan jiru baayyee gaarii natti fakkaata
Not very well, but she was working.	Baayyee gaarii miti, garuu isheen hojjechaa turte.
I am never going to be a good enough husband.	Ani gonkumaa abbaa manaa gaarii gahaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
I can't believe this	Kana amanuu hin danda'u
Still not quite there.	Ammas guutummaatti hin jiru.
And it’s happening again.	Ammas ta’ee jira.
I can't go back there	Achitti deebi'uu hin danda'u
But now I know better.	Amma garuu caalaatti beeka.
That's what's happening.	Kan ta'aa jiru kanuma.
I just need to give it time.	Yeroo kennuu qofa na barbaachisa.
I am glad to have him with us	Isa nu bira jiraachuu kootti gammadeera
Little.	Xiqqoo.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu qofa.
That would never ever happen.	Sun gonkumaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
I want to go home now, please	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaada maaloo
I don't want to come back here again.	Ammas as deebi'uu hin barbaadu.
He was never supposed to come back.	Inni gonkumaa deebi'uu hin qabu ture.
I really like this one	Isa kana baay'een jaalladha
But someone is going to do it.	Garuu namni tokko hojjechuuf deema.
I knew it was nothing	Homaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
Everything looks good.	Wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata.
He must have it.	Inni qabaachuu qaba.
That is not the case today.	Har'a akkas hin taane.
Everything seemed right, but something was very wrong.	Wanti hundi sirrii fakkaata ture, garuu wanti tokko baay'ee dogoggora ture.
He knew exactly what he meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaade sirriitti beeka ture
I need your help please	Gargaarsa keessan na barbaachisa mee
Not sure why this would happen.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
That’s not a big deal.	Sun waan guddaa miti.
I know you have to	Akka ati gochuu qabdu nan beeka
He told her she still couldn’t eat	Ammallee nyaachuu akka hin dandeenye itti hime
I couldn't have asked for more	Kana caalaa gaafachuu dhiisuu hin danda'u ture
I wonder who did that	Eenyu akkas godhe jedheen yaada
I don't need anything	Homaa na hin barbaachisu
This is only in very specific cases, of course.	Kun haala baayyee adda ta’e keessatti qofa akka ta’e beekamaadha.
Sometimes they work late.	Yeroo tokko tokko yeroon booda hojjetu.
It’s completely fine.	Guutummaatti gaarii dha.
You can’t do that.	Sana gochuu hin dandeessu.
It looked good.	Gaarii fakkaata ture.
I knew he had thought of this idea before	Yaada kana kanaan dura akka yaade nan beeka ture
I can't, I just can't.	Hin danda'u, hin danda'u qofa.
He should know that this is true	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekuu qaba
I think you need something	Waan si barbaachisa jedheen yaada
I don't know, but something happened inside her	Ani hin beeku, garuu keessa ishee keessatti wanti tokko ta'e
I told you just one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko qofa sitti hime.
I'm not your parents	Ani warra kee miti
I was with her, too.	Anis ishee waliin ture.
Maybe too obvious.	Tarii garmalee ifa ta'uu danda'a.
It was still with him, maybe it always will be.	Ammas isa bira ture, tarii yeroo hundumaa ni ta'a.
I just need a little help.	Gargaarsa xiqqoo qofa na barbaachisa.
I know him very well	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka
There was nothing else	Wanti biraa hin turre
It means someone she knows.	Nama isheen beektu jechuu dha.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
But things were very different today.	Garuu har'a wanti baayyee adda ture.
That's what happened last week.	Torban darbe wanti akkasii ta'e.
I didn't know any other way.	Karaa biraa itti ta'u hin beeku ture.
It might just be me.	Ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I don't have anything like that	Ani waan akkasii hin qabu
I can't do any more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin danda'u.
. . . .	.
Everyone has one.	Namni hundi tokko qaba.
This was different, very different.	Kun adda ture, baayyee adda ture.
She was one of many.	Baay'ee keessaa tokko turte.
She should never have stayed home.	Silaa gonkumaa mana turuu hin qabdu turte.
That was two weeks ago.	Sun torban lama dura ture.
They were just there.	Isaan achi qofa turan.
I have none of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin qabu.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
There are people here.	Namoonni as jiru.
Instead ?.	Bakka isaa ?.
You can live there, you can live there.	Achi jiraachuu dandeessa, achi jiraachuu dandeessa.
I really want to see him	Isa arguu baay'een barbaada
Certainly not in mine.	Kan koo keessa akka hin jirre beekamaadha.
I don't have that.	Ani akkas hin qabu.
He's out at work tomorrow.	Boru hojii irratti ala jira.
Today that’s not true.	Har’a sun dhugaa miti.
I know a lot of people who don't	Namoota akkas hin goone baay'een beeka
This was much more than enough.	Kun baayyee gahaa ol ture.
I need a lot of sleep	Hirriba baay'een na barbaachisa
So far it is accurate.	Hanga ammaatti sirrii dha.
I never want to be him again.	Amma booda isa ta'uu gonkumaa hin barbaadu.
Had you been there you would have known.	Silaa achi turte silaa beekta.
That one was the worst.	Inni sun isa hamaa ture.
I just had to have it in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti qabaachuu qofa qaba ture
That's not going to happen.	Sun ta'uuf hin deemu.
He had to answer.	Deebii kennuu qaba ture.
It was only three hours.	Yeroon isaa sa'aatii sadii qofa ture.
But there must be more to it than that.	Garuu kana caalaa waan biraa jiraachuu qaba.
There were two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama turan.
This is nothing at all.	Kun tasumaa homaa miti.
I knew how that worked	Sun akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka ture
That stuff is pretty cool.	Wanti sun baayyee namatti tola.
Maybe just a couple of hours.	Tarii sa'aatii lama lama qofa.
Now she had three children around.	Amma ijoollee sadii naannoo ishee qabdi turte.
I don't think this is true	Kun dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu
I wouldn't have known otherwise.	Silaa osoo akkas ta'ee hin beeku ture.
He was very good to me.	Inni baay'ee naaf gaarii ture.
Then you’re the one.	Sana booda ati.
That was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture.
He said that.	Akkas jedheera.
I know she wants to see you	Si arguu akka barbaaddu nan beeka
How come you didn’t talk to your kids.	Akkamitti ijoollee keessan waliin hin dubbanne.
She didn't know anyone the right age.	Nama umuriin isaa sirrii ta'e hin beektu turte.
I couldn’t ask for anything more	Kana caalaa waan tokko gaafachuu hin dandeenye
Just tell me what you need.	Waan si barbaachisu qofa natti himi.
I didn't want to be alone anymore	Kana booda kophaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
I mean, we get along well	Akka gaariitti waliin walii jirra jechuu kooti
I can't live without children	Ijoollee malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
He didn’t go to work.	Hojii hojjechuuf hin deemne.
I know a great deal about her	Waa'ee ishee waan guddaa beeka
You don't have any.	Ati tokkollee hin qabdu.
I just wasn’t interested	Ani qofa fedhii hin qabu ture
We are here to help you.	Isin gargaaruuf as jirra.
So much for that.	Kanaaf baay'ee.
Eat a good diet.	Nyaata gaarii nyaachuu.
I wasn't sure about any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
They shouldn’t have much trouble.	Rakkoo guddaa qabaachuu hin qaban.
We had work to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabna turre.
Then they come at it again.	Sana booda ammas itti dhufu.
I knew it wasn’t my idea	Yaada koo akka hin taane nan beeka ture
He always seems to know everyone.	Yeroo hundumaa nama hunda waan beeku fakkaata.
She seems to have done it before.	Kanaan dura waan goote fakkaata.
I know exactly where she is.	Bakka isheen jirtu sirriitti beeka.
You have to work with us.	Nu waliin hojjechuu qabda.
I want to be doing something	Waan tokko hojjechaa jiraachuu barbaada
Probably not much.	Tarii baay'ee miti.
This is usually good.	Yeroo baayyee kun gaarii dha.
I don't say anything	Ani homaa hin jedhu
No mistake, just nothing.	Dogoggora hin qabu, homaa qofa.
He didn’t look like me at all.	Inni tasumaa na hin fakkaatu ture.
I didn’t think he would	Inni waan godhu natti hin fakkaatu ture
I hope you can’t tell them	Akka isaan himuu hin dandeenye abdiin qaba
Not sure if it's the right way.	Karaa sirrii ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
You know that part.	Kutaa sana ni beekta.
Then there were my children.	Sana booda ijoollee koo turan.
I knew it was hopeless	Abdii akka hin qabne nan beeka ture
One of them spoke to me.	Isaan keessaa tokko natti dubbate.
But it doesn’t matter anymore.	Garuu kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
I can't do it.	Ani hojjechuu hin danda'u.
Now, he rarely talks about his feelings.	Amma, waa’ee miira isaa yeroo muraasaaf dubbata.
It wouldn’t go any further.	Kana caalaa hin deemu ture.
Nobody here noticed	Namni as jiru hin hubanne
He already knew the answer	Deebii isaa duruu beeka ture
But that wasn’t my issue.	Garuu sun dhimma koo hin turre.
You have to do something.	Waan hojjechuu qabda.
I know them too well.	Ani garmalee isaan beeka.
I really want to meet them	Isaan waliin wal arguu baay'een barbaada
He wants what is right for you	Waan siif ta'u barbaada
We met one day.	Guyyaa tokko wal argine.
He was such a nice guy about it.	Inni waa'ee kanaa gurbaa akkasii namatti tola ture.
I know he can see that in my eyes	Ija koo keessatti sana arguu akka dandaʼu nan beeka
Very good idea.	Yaada baayyee gaarii ta'e.
But still it was nothing.	Garuu ammas homaa hin turre.
I didn’t understand that for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas naaf hin galle.
I had so many questions	Gaaffii baay'een qaba ture
They are really, really good parents.	Dhuguma dhuguma warra gaarii dha.
That's just too long.	Sun baayyee dheeraa qofa.
I hope not every night is like this	Halkan hundi akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba
I can meet you tomorrow.	Boru wal arguu nan danda'a.
I hadn't really thought about that	Dhuguma waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne ture
It seemed so easy.	Baayyee salphaa fakkaata ture.
I couldn't believe it was true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye.
He knew what had to happen now.	Waan amma taʼuu qabu ni beeka ture.
I had no idea.	Yaada hin qabu ture.
I was really excited!	Dhuguma gammadeera!
I don't understand this	Kana naaf hin galle
I’m right here in front of you	Ani sirriitti si dura as jira
This was completely wrong.	Kun guutummaatti dogoggora ture.
She didn't need it.	Ishee hin barbaachifne.
I never knew who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
I didn’t want it at all	Ani tasumaa hin barbaanne
I couldn’t ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
I said there was no chance	Carraan hin jiru jedheen
I hoped that was not the case	Akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba ture
Not with this person.	Nama kanaan miti.
I would definitely go there again.	Ammas achi deemuun koo hin oolu.
She's not there.	Isheen achi hin jirtu.
It wasn’t anything like that	Waan akkasii hin turre
That was really great.	Sun dhuguma guddaa ture.
He had something else to do.	Waan biraa hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
He knew that voice very well.	Sagalee sana baayyee sirriitti beeka ture.
But that's not what happened.	Garuu waan ta'e kana miti.
I don't love you, dog	Si hin jaalladhu saree
I wonder if anyone can really do it	Dhuguma namni danda'u jiraa jedheen yaada
We have nothing now.	Amma homaa hin qabnu.
He didn't do anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin hojjenne.
We’ve been friends for a long time.	Hiriyyoota yeroo dheeraaf turre.
Probably not much.	Tarii baay'ee miti.
I am none of these things	Ani wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee miti
It was never going to happen.	Gonkumaa ta'uuf hin turre.
I can't do anything to help her	Ishee gargaaruuf homaa gochuu hin danda'u
I thought you knew who this was	Kana eenyu akka ta'e ni beektu jedheen yaade
I enjoyed it very much	Baay'een itti gammadeera
He thought about it.	Isa irratti yaade.
Not sure about that	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa miti
They were the only two things they had.	Wantoota isaan qaban lamaan qofa turan.
I can't believe you know all this time	Yeroo kana hunda beekta jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
So tell me now.	Kanaaf amma natti himi.
I have to do this for me	Kana naaf gochuun qaba
That's how he did it.	Akkasitti godhe.
I am by no means alone in this	Kana keessa tasumaa kophaa koo miti
I hope this can help you.	Kun akka isin gargaaruu danda'u abdiin qaba.
He knows exactly where he is in her house	Mana ishee keessa eessa akka jiru sirriitti beeka
I can't play anymore	Kana booda taphachuu hin danda'u
Now I want to be around all the time.	Amma yeroo hunda naannoo koo jiraachuu barbaada.
I didn't look like my father	Ani waan abbaa koo hin fakkaatu ture
Perhaps he was right.	Tarii sirrii ture taʼa.
But I can't.	Ani garuu hin danda'u.
Talking about them.	Waa'ee isaanii dubbachuu.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
Time you never knew without him	Yeroo isa malee hin beekne
But it didn’t go that far.	Garuu hanga kana hin deemne.
Let's look at it now.	Mee amma ilaalaa.
I want to be a good person	Nama gaarii ta'uu nan barbaada
I know, already.	Ani beeka, duruu.
I didn’t want to work on one	Tokko irratti hojjechuu hin barbaanne
One week requires three.	Torban tokko sadii barbaada.
Which is a good thing.	Kan waan gaarii ta'e.
I'm not saying that would be bad	Sun hamaa ta'a jechuu koo miti
He took two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama fudhate.
I knew there was something here	Asitti waan tokko akka jiru nan beeka ture
You can become a human being.	Nama ta'uu dandeessa.
I have him in my mouth	Afaan koo keessa isa qaba
If it was just him, it wouldn't matter.	Osoo inni qofa ta'ee barbaachisaa hin ta'u ture.
It wasn’t that great at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas guddaa hin turre.
I always thought that would be the case	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'a jedheen yaada ture
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
It’s really good.	Dhuguma gaarii dha.
I hoped she wouldn’t notice	Isheen akka hin hubanne abdiin qaba ture
You just have to ask.	Gaafachuu qofa qabda.
He was a real man.	Nama dhugaa ture.
So it was too late.	Kanaaf yeroon darbe.
If it were easy, everyone would do it.	Osoo salphaa ta'ee namni hundi ni hojjeta ture.
I want to know more about it	Waa'ee kanaa caalaatti beekuu barbaada
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
It works very well for me.	Baayyee naaf hojjeta.
I can do my homework later	Hojii manaa koo booda hojjechuu nan dandaʼa
Today is my duty day.	Har'a guyyaa dirqama kooti.
She was on her way.	Karaa irra turte.
He didn't think he could.	Inni ni danda'a jedhee hin yaadne.
I didn’t know I knew any of these people	Namoota kana keessaa tokkollee beekuu koo hin beekne
But then the time passed.	Garuu sana booda yeroon sun darbe.
I want to be around you and boy	Naannoo kee fi gurbaa ta'uu barbaada
Many of us have several.	Baay'een keenya hedduu qabna.
You don’t need it.	Si hin barbaachisu.
I’m not saying we should know	Beekuu qabna jechuu koo miti
I mean that at the time	Yeroo sanatti akkas jechuu kooti
But they are looking at me.	Garuu na ilaalaa jiru.
No one knows why that would happen.	Namni akkas ta'ee maaliif akka ta'u hin beeku.
You want us.	Nu barbaaddu.
This isn't all about you.	Kun hundi waa'ee kee miti.
I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
It’s my passion.	Fedhii kooti.
For a moment I wondered if something was wrong	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti tokko dogoggora jiraa jedheen yaade
I need you now as much as you need me.	Akkuma ati na barbaaddu amma si barbaada.
I think about everything.	Waan hundumaa nan yaada.
I didn't understand this	Ani kana hin hubanne
I recognize that voice	Sagalee sana nan beeka
I was the one who found you	Kan si argate ana ture
No one is really saying that.	Dhuguma namni akkas jechuu isaa hin jiru.
Before long, people are looking for something new.	Yeroo muraasa booda namoonni waan haaraa biraa barbaadaa jiru.
But it was never enough.	Garuu gonkumaa gahaa hin turre.
I wasn’t in that mood	Ani akkasitti miira keessa hin turre
He can tell something is going on.	Waan tokko akka deemaa jiru beekuu danda'a.
I wish she was mine	Osoo isheen kan koo taate natti tola
I didn’t notice for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hin hubanne.
I really want this to work	Kun akka hojjetu baay'een barbaada
I still can't believe it.	Ammallee amanuu hin danda'u.
So it doesn't happen that way.	Kanaaf akkasitti hin ta'u.
This happens all the time.	Kun yeroo hundumaa ni ta’a.
I mean a lot of things by that.	Kana jechuun waan baay’ee jechuu kooti.
Much, much, much more.	Baay'ee baay'ee baay'ee caalaa.
Maybe something a little simpler is better.	Tarii wanti xiqqoo salphaa ta'e wayya ta'a.
I am one of the lucky ones	Ani warra carraa qaban keessaa tokko
You can go home.	Gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
They have a lot of work to do though.	Hojii baay'ee qabu garuu.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
There were a lot of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee turan.
I am in a fortunate position	Ani haala carraa qabu keessa jira
I think you have a lot going for you.	Waan baay'ee siif deemu waan qabdu natti fakkaata.
I don’t know why she made such a big deal about it.	Maaliif akkas irratti waan guddaa akka goote hin beeku.
I think now is a good time	Amma yeroo gaarii natti fakkaata
There wasn't much he could do out here.	As ala wanti inni gochuu danda'u baay'ee hin turre.
It wasn’t complete without her	Ishee malee guutuu hin turre
I know it’s not that easy	Akkas salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
He wasn't going to be the one to do it.	Inni nama kana godhu ta'uuf hin turre.
A little bit of that	Xiqqoo sana keessaa
She had no idea what she had done.	Waan goote yaada hin qabdu turte.
We weren’t together for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf waliin hin turre.
I know something is wrong	Waan tokko akka dogoggora ta'e nan beeka
I didn't think things could handle it	Wanti waan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu ture
They come here.	Halkan dhufu.
No mistake, just nothing.	Dogoggora hin qabu, homaa qofa.
But not all of it.	Garuu hunda isaa miti.
I didn’t know you were in here	As keessa akka jirtu hin beeku ture
No more, tonight.	Kana booda hin jiru, halkan kana.
I want to get a drink with you	Si waliin dhugaatii argachuu barbaada
And I didn't want to be good.	Anis gaarii ta'uu hin barbaanne.
He was once one of them.	Yeroo tokko isaan keessaa tokko ture.
I knew it would happen again.	Ammas akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
I was a different person then	Ani yeroo sana nama adda ture
I doubt it’s been working for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf hojjechaa akka ture nan shakka
I couldn't go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
That’s important and pretty obvious.	Sun barbaachisaa fi baay’ee ifaadha.
She should be here.	Isheen as ta'uu qabdi.
I couldn't then, I can't now.	Yeroo sanatti hin dandeenye, amma hin danda'u.
I don't have to.	Ani dirqama miti.
I mean, that's pretty important out there.	Sun achi keessaa baayyee barbaachisaa dha jechuu kooti.
I know now that this is true	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa amma beeka
She was a mother.	Haadha ture.
I don’t want it anymore.	Kana booda hin barbaadu.
People are going.	Namoonni deemaa jiru.
A while passed.	Yeroon tokko darbe.
I know you’re trying to help	Gargaaruuf yaalaa akka jirtu nan beeka
He didn't do it very often.	Yeroo baay'ee hin godhu ture.
You know this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu ni beekta.
Again, it was a great answer.	Ammas deebii guddaa ture.
I knew it was too good to be true	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii akka ta'e nan beeka ture
This is not a big deal.	Kun dhimma guddaa miti.
I looked at the picture again	Ammas suuraa sana ilaale
I know it will never go away	Yoomiyyuu akka hin deemne nan beeka
Everything is possible here.	Asitti wanti hundi ni danda'ama.
I thought so, too.	Anis akkas jedheen yaada ture.
Just like them.	Akkuma isaanii.
It was just the truth.	Dhugaa qofa ture.
How long ago was that.	Yeroo meeqa dura ture sun.
One might ask how he could have said such a thing.	Namni tokko akkamitti waan akkasii dubbachuu dandaʼa ture jedhee gaafachuu dandaʼa.
I haven’t spoken to anyone yet	Hanga ammaatti nama waliin hin dubbanne
I want him to love me	Akka inni na jaallatu nan barbaada
I would love to get some feedback.	Yaada tokko tokko argachuu nan jaalladha.
This can't be good!.	Kun gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u!.
I think she’s great	Isheen guddaa natti fakkaata
I saw nothing of them	Isaan keessaa homaa hin argine
But I don't think we should do that here	Asitti garuu kana gochuu qabna jedhee hin yaadu
Perhaps that could work.	Tarii sun hojjechuu dandaʼa.
Their problems were his.	Rakkoon isaanii kan isaa ture.
I just looked him in the eye	Ija keessa isa ilaale qofa
I don't do anything.	Ani homaa hin godhu.
He had no children	Ijoollee hin qabu ture
It's been happening.	Ta'ee jira.
This shouldn't be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu.
It looks a lot, it looks great.	Baayyee fakkaata, guddaa fakkaata.
It’s not even necessary.	Barbaachisaa illee miti.
Everything works except one thing.	Waan tokko malee wanti hundi ni hojjeta.
He wasn’t there.	Inni hin turre.
I certainly have an opinion	Ani yaada akkan qabu beekamaadha
But only one problem.	Garuu rakkoo tokko qofa.
Even the one with eyes.	Kan ija qabu illee.
I didn't tell him anything.	Homaa itti hin himne.
I think they will help	Ni gargaaru jedheen yaada
It really never happens.	Dhuguma gonkumaa hin ta'u.
Now I know two things	Amma waan lama beeka
Why would anyone want her .	Namni maaliif ishee barbaada .
It's probably something you've always wanted to do.	Waan yeroo hunda hojjechuu barbaaddu ta'uu hin oolu.
He looked like my father	Abbaa koo fakkaata ture
Perhaps he was thinking as he said.	Tarii akkuma jedhe yaada ture.
But, it was like that.	Garuu, akkas ture.
That we need help.	Gargaarsa akka nu barbaachisu.
Only.	Qofa.
Again, again, again.	Ammas, ammas.
That’s completely wrong.	Sun guutummaatti dogoggora.
My lucky day.	Guyyaa carraa koo.
He didn't know it was his daughter	Intala isaa ta'uu hin beeku ture
He did that for a very long time	Yeroo baayyee dheeraaf akkas godhe
I might have thought	Silaa jedheen yaade ta'a
I just didn’t speak to anyone	Ani nama tokkollee hin dubbanne qofa ture
It was that thing.	Waan sana ture.
I can't do it tonight now	Halkan kana amma gochuu hin danda'u
Now, she couldn’t do that.	Amma, isheen akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
But otherwise they can be both.	Garuu yoo kana hin taane lamaan isaanii ta'uu danda'u.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
I was with you throughout	Yeroo hundumaa keessa si waliin ture
I would never have thought of it	Silaa gonkumaa hin yaadu ture
They know you have it.	Akka qabdu ni beeku.
He came out of three.	Sadii keessaa ba'e.
I am as curious as you are.	Ani akkuma kee fedhii guddaa qaba.
I told him it wasn’t a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii akka hin taane itti hime.
I was so into the guy.	Ani akkasitti gurbaa sana keessa ture.
I think she was fine	Isheen gaarii turte jedheen yaada
I was just saying.	jechuu koo qofa ture.
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa.
It matters right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana dhimma qaba.
I suspect not	Akka hin taane nan shakka
I love it when it happens.	Yeroo ta'u baay'een jaalladha.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
It was a huge disaster.	Balaa guddaa ture.
I was sure about it	Waa'ee kanaa mirkanaa'aa ture
I wanted to have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu barbaade.
I like this girl already	Intala kana duruu natti tola
He had a feeling he was right.	Miira sirrii ta'uu isaa qaba ture.
I am absolutely thrilled	Ani guutummaatti gammadeera
I never needed it again	Kana booda gonkumaa na hin barbaachisu ture
That may help, it may not.	Sun gargaaruu dandaʼa, taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
That can be done.	Sun gochuun ni danda’ama.
Maybe it's the night.	Tarii halkan ta'uu danda'a.
In one room, like this one.	Kutaa tokko keessatti, akka kanaa.
I just can't do anything about it	Ani homaa gochuu qofa hin danda'u
You can do this.	Kana gochuu dandeessa.
They are all good.	Hundi isaanii gaarii dha.
Me, not so much.	Ana, hangas miti.
I think it’s what you make of it.	Waan ati irraa gootu natti fakkaata.
Still, it would have been fine.	Ammas ta'ee silaa gaarii ture.
That would be, you know, pretty bad.	Sun, beekta, baayyee hamaa ta'a.
Very good friends.	Hiriyyoota baayyee gaarii.
Someone gave me a chance.	Namni tokko carraa naaf kenne.
The way they go.	Karaa itti deemu.
I knew what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka ture.
I am in the same situation	Anis haala wal fakkaatu keessa jira
They are old school.	Isaan mana barumsaa durii dha.
He was making a terrible mistake	Dogoggora hamaa hojjechaa ture
I didn’t always understand.	Yeroo hundumaa naaf hin galle.
He had a job to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
I'm watching two o'clock in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii lama ilaalaa jira.
Both of you.	Lamaan keessan.
That can be a good thing and a bad thing.	Sun waan gaarii fi hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
But they were his.	Isaan garuu kan isaa turan.
We made a mistake.	Dogoggora hojjenne.
I think it looks better now than it did in the old days	Bara durii caalaa amma waan gaarii fakkaata jedheen yaada
I don't know him.	Ani isa hin beeku.
I didn’t think anything of it	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne
They have no more questions.	Kana booda gaaffii hin qaban.
I was waiting a little bit	Xiqqoo eegaa ture
I mean, you really didn’t have to	Dhuguma dirqama hin turre jechuu kooti
He looked at it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ilaale.
Now, of course, everyone seems to have one.	Amma, beekamaadha, namni hundi tokko waan qabu fakkaata.
They are not mine.	Isaan kan koo miti.
This is certainly not the case.	Kun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That should be enough.	Sun gahaa ta'uu qaba.
There's not much else around.	Naannoo sanatti wanti biraa baay'ee hin jiru.
I really didn't want to talk about it now.	Dhuguma amma waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
I sleep a lot now.	Amma baay'een hirriba.
I have no problem with anything.	Ani homaa irratti rakkoo hin qabu.
I should have told him earlier.	Silaa kanaan dura itti himuu qaba ture.
Not very long.	Baayyee dheeraa miti.
He didn't tell anyone	Namatti hin himne
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
I didn’t know her name	Maqaa ishee hin beeku ture
You are in our house.	Mana keenya keessa jirta.
You have to go with your feelings	Miira kee waliin deemuu qabda
He was that guy.	Inni gurbaa sana ture.
I don’t sleep at all	Ani tasumaa hirriba hin qabu
I have said it.	jedheen jira.
I'm not qualified anymore	Kana booda ga'umsa hin qabu
I’ve been watching you.	Si ilaalaa tureera.
I should never have gone.	Silaa gonkumaa deemuu hin qabu ture.
I don't have anything else.	Waan biraa hin qabu.
I mean, just the door	Balbala qofa jechuu kooti
They are still together.	Ammallee waliin jiru.
For the most part, he didn't speak.	Irra caalaa hin dubbanne.
You know the inside.	Keessa beekta.
We are always there.	Yeroo hundumaa ni jirra.
Now that’s two.	Amma sun lama.
I am definitely not a morning person	Ani nama ganama akka hin taane beekamaadha
I could do this all day	Guyyaa guutuu kana gochuu nan dandaʼa ture
It's always pretty much around me	Yeroo hundumaa baay'ee naannoo kooti
He knew what to do.	Waan godhu beeka ture.
Maybe it's too soon.	Tarii dafee ta'uu danda'a.
That was true enough a week ago.	Sun torban tokko dura dhugaa gahaa ture.
He had a feeling this would happen.	Kun akka ta'u miira qaba ture.
I wish they hadn't done that	Osoo akkas hin goone ta'ee natti tola
We agreed with this.	Kana waliin walii galle.
In his hands.	Harka isaa keessa.
I thought they were my friends	Hiriyyoota koo natti fakkaate
I was pretty sure you would	Akka ati gootu baay'ee mirkanaa'aa ture
Everything seemed to come out right with this one	Tokko kanaan wanti hundi sirriitti waan ba'e fakkaata ture
But I can't do that.	Garuu akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
There was nothing she could do about that.	Sana irratti wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
I hadn’t seen one before	Kana dura tokkollee hin argine ture
We would have no issues.	Silaa dhimma tokkollee hin qabnu turre.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
That’s what he would have done.	Silaa kanuma godha ture.
We need your help.	Gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa.
I am a mother, you are a mother.	Ani haadha, ati haadha.
I don’t really know this area.	Dhuguma naannoo kana hin beeku.
But there was no one in the room.	Garuu kutaa sana keessa namni hin turre.
Often more than that.	Yeroo baayyee kana caalaa.
He always wanted money	Yeroo hundumaa maallaqa barbaada ture
I still love them both	Ammallee lamaan isaanii nan jaalladha
Just your room.	Kutaa keessan qofa.
I had to have it, of course	Ani qabaachuu qaba ture, beekamaadha
It’s a good idea.	Yaada gaarii dha.
I think that’s around it	Naannoo isaa kanuma natti fakkaata
It’s not a bad life here.	Asitti jireenya hamaa miti.
That wasn’t it.	Sun hin turre.
He knew this time would come	Yeroon kun akka dhufu beeka ture
Wait, wait, wait.	Eegaa eegaa eegaa.
I want to say something.	Waan tokko jechuu barbaada.
But now tell me.	Amma garuu natti himi.
I can't always find them	Yeroo hunda isaan argachuu hin danda'u
He would have had a name to think of.	Silaa maqaa itti yaadu qaba ture.
We were in good shape.	Haala gaarii irra turre.
I had no idea what she was going to say	Maal jechuu akka deemtu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I had no idea what that meant.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
But he got lucky.	Garuu carraa argate.
They need to know their place.	Bakka isaanii beekuu qabu.
He often works with my father.	Yeroo baayyee abbaa koo waliin hojjeta.
It would have gotten bad pretty quickly	Silaa dafee hamaa ta'a ture
I think he said that.	Akkas jedhe natti fakkaata.
I do this all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa kana nan godha.
I want to say that.	Ani akkas jedheen barbaada.
Little by little.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo.
But they are different.	Garuu isaan adda.
I know this person.	Nama kana nan beeka.
I didn’t do it.	Ani hin goone.
I said it doesn't work like that	Akkasitti hin hojjetu jedheen
I had no intention of doing such a thing	Waan akkasii hojjechuuf homaa hin yaadne ture
I was with him, too.	Anis isa waliin ture.
But I doubt it very much	Ani garuu baay'een shakka
It has three functions.	Hojii sadii qaba.
But she was like that.	Isheen garuu akkas turte.
I might have it.	Ani qabaachuu danda'a.
I love them so much.	Baay'een isaan jaalladha.
I wouldn’t go, not without him.	Ani hin deemu ture, isa malee miti.
There was no time like that.	Yeroon akkas ta'e hin turre.
But I don't tell anyone	Ani garuu namatti hin himu
I just couldn't believe it was me	Ana ta'uu isaa qofa amanuu hin dandeenye
Except we didn’t.	Nuti hin goone malee.
This even without an issue.	Kun dhimma tokko malee illee.
Not very good.	Baayyee gaarii miti.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
I didn't understand at all	Ani tasumaa naaf hin galle
But it is a must.	Garuu dirqama.
I didn't want to be one of those	Ani warra sana keessaa tokko ta'uu hin barbaanne
I told him what had happened	Waan ta'e itti hime
She is not a human being.	Isheen nama miti.
I want to get back to my life	Jireenya kootti deebi'uu barbaada
Inside you, in a place, in a situation.	Keessa kee, bakka tokko keessa, haala tokko keessa.
But that’s not enough, he said.	Garuu sun gahaa miti jedhe.
Many of us did that here.	Baay'een keenya asitti akkas goone.
I am with them.	Ani isaan waliin jira.
He knew he was on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra akka jiru ni beeka ture.
What was that.	Maal ture sun.
You just don’t know everything.	Waan hundumaa hin beektu qofa.
I thought he was different	Inni adda natti fakkaate
With his own wife?.	Haadha manaa ofii waliin?.
I know what she’s doing	Waan isheen gootu nan beeka
You don’t make it very easy.	Baayyee salphaa hin gootu.
I need them.	Isaan na barbaachisa.
I know he loves me very much.	Baay'ee akka na jaallatu nan beeka.
I had to do something.	Waan tokko gochuun qaba ture.
I didn’t know her real name.	Maqaa ishee isa dhugaa hin beeku ture.
There is no time.	Yeroon hin jiru.
I will always love you	Yeroo hundumaa si jaalladha
I hope you weren’t.	Ati akka hin turre abdiin qaba.
It took time.	Yeroo fudhate.
I have been waiting for you for hours and hours	Sa'aatii fi sa'aatii si eegaa tureera
I want to make a suggestion.	Yaada tokko kennuu barbaada.
I can't stop seeing them.	Isaan arguu dhiisuu hin danda'u.
She just had to go. 	Isheen deemuu qofa qabdi turte. 
it was really, really good.	dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii ture.
You know more about them than you should.	Waaʼee isaanii wanta beekuu qabdu caalaa beekta.
I really hope so	Dhuguma akkas akka ta'u abdiin qaba
You've been working so hard.	Ati baay'ee hojjechaa turte.
she said.	jette.
You can't go back.	Deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
I don't think it will happen anymore.	Kana booda waan ta'u natti hin fakkaatu.
I know you want to see me.	Na arguu akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
With the dog.	Saree waliin.
All this life.	Jireenya kana hunda.
I hadn’t seen them before	Kanaan dura isaan hin argine ture
That’s what we’ve seen.	Kan argine kanuma.
But it was the only way they had.	Garuu karaa isaan qaban qofa ture.
I still have them all, of course.	Ammallee hunda isaanii akkan qabu beekamaadha.
I thought that would be me.	Sun ana ta'a jedheen yaade.
He was trying to make it work	Akka hojjetu gochuuf yaalaa ture
They didn’t understand.	Isaan hin hubanne.
This is my life’s work.	Kun hojii jireenya kooti.
It's always just somewhat.	Yeroo hundumaa hamma tokko qofa ta'a.
But it wasn’t a joke.	Garuu qoosaa hin turre.
It won't be a full hour	Sa'aatii guutuu hin ta'u
No real job, no real job.	Hojii dhugaa hin qabu, hojii dhugaa hin qabu.
He wasn't there.	Achi hin turre.
I already know this.	Kana duruu beeka.
You are doing a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjechaa jirta.
It seems to be.	Ni fakkaata.
I knew it would happen, though	Akka ta'u nan beeka ture, garuu
He may be more omniscient.	Kana caalaa waan hunda beeku ta’uu danda’a.
It's just bad.	Hamaa qofa.
I need a drink.	Dhugaatii na barbaachisa.
I have someone working on it right now	Yeroo ammaa kana nama irratti hojjetu qaba
You have done nothing to your wife	Haadha manaa kee irratti homaa hin goone
But this is not what happens.	Garuu waan ta'u kana miti.
I would love your feedback.	Yaada keessan baay'een jaalladha.
He wants the truth.	Dhugaa jiru barbaada.
Now he was an adult.	Amma nama guddaa ture.
I can't believe it took me this long	Yeroo dheeraa kana natti fudhate jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I can’t tell you what that moment was	Yeroon sun maal akka ta’e sitti himuu hin danda’u
He didn’t really have a life	Dhuguma jireenya hin qabu ture
But it still didn’t work.	Garuu ammas hin hojjenne.
I mean, you know me pretty well	Ati baay'ee na beektu jechuu kooti
I just can't talk about it	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu qofa hin danda'u
I told him the truth.	Dhugaa jiru itti hime.
It may not be you.	Si ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I mean, this is really good	Kun dhuguma gaarii dha jechuu kooti
You were a big help to me tonight.	Halkan kana gargaarsa guddaa naaf taate.
So it was one of two things that was going to happen.	Kanaaf waan ta'uuf deemu lama keessaa tokko ture.
I didn’t know this thing existed	Wanti kun akka jiru hin beeku ture
But it really wasn’t like that.	Garuu dhuguma akkas hin turre.
He is very well known.	Inni baay'ee beekamaadha.
It's not what our job is.	Hojiin keenya maal akka ta'e miti.
I loved working with them	Isaan waliin hojjechuu nan jaalladha ture
I wasn’t in that mood	Miira akkasii keessa hin turre
Everyone is ahead of me.	Hundi na dura.
But that was tomorrow.	Sun garuu boru ture.
Why, really.	Maaliif, dhuguma.
I know what she wants	Waan isheen barbaaddu nan beeka
I won't tell you why why	Maaliif maaliif akka ta'e sitti hin himu
I won't do it again.	Ammas hin godhu.
I am unemployed.	Ani hojii malee jira.
She said she didn't.	Hin goone jette.
She's pretty good at them.	Isheen isaan irratti baayyee gaarii dha.
I wondered what that was	Sun maali jedheen yaade
If they had to be, they were there.	Yoo ta’uu qaban, yoo ta’uu qaban achi turan.
I can do that.	Ani akkas gochuu nan danda'a.
I think this is possible.	Kun ni danda'ama jedheen yaada.
You have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
He didn’t have anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin qabu ture.
I like money.	Maallaqa natti tola.
Keep your comments, you two.	Yaada keessan eegaa isin lamaan.
You have to live for these people.	Namoota kanaaf jiraachuu qabda.
I would never do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture
There was no problem.	Rakkoon hin turre.
But there is nothing.	Garuu homaa hin jiru.
No need to comment.	Yaada kennuu hin barbaachisu.
I told him the idea	Anis yaada sana itti hime
Not a little bit.	Hanga xiqqoo miti.
That you are.	Akka ati.
I knew she was out there	Isheen ala akka jirtu nan beeka ture
I still can't go.	Ammas deemuu hin danda'u.
He couldn't have done it	Hin danda'u ture
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I walked right into it	Anis sirriitti isa keessa deeme
This can work.	Kun hojjechuu danda'a.
I was trying to help him.	Isa gargaaruuf yaalaa ture.
That didn’t happen.	Sun hin taane.
I knew it was not in a very good place	Bakka baayyee gaarii akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
There she said.	Achitti jette.
I didn’t know you were here.	As akka jirtu hin beeku ture.
There's not much else around.	Naannoo sanatti wanti biraa baay'ee hin jiru.
I already have three carts	Duraan gaarii sadii qaba
But not otherwise.	Garuu osoo akkas ta'ee hin taane.
I want to know about tonight	Waa'ee halkan kanaa beekuu barbaada
You are not with me.	Ati na waliin hin jirtu.
First this happens then this.	Dura kun ta'a sana booda kun.
I know that is a terrible thing to say	Sun jechuun waan hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka
It wouldn't have been perfect	Silaa guutuu hin ta'u ture
He never stayed here.	Asitti gonkumaa hin turre.
They know, now, what we have.	Isaan beeku, amma, waan nuti qabnu.
He hadn't told me about it.	Waa'ee kanaa natti hin himne ture.
It wasn’t that long.	Yeroo dheeraa hangas hin turre.
It doesn’t mean any of what it says.	Waan jedhu keessaa tokkollee jechuu miti.
If you disagree, no problem.	Yoo walii hin galle rakkoo hin qabu.
I'm not very good at it though.	Ani garuu baayyee ga'umsa hin qabu.
They are still there.	Ammas achi jiru.
But that only goes so far.	Garuu sun hanga kana qofa deema.
I thought he was so lucky	Akkas carraa qaba jedheen yaade
He was right on the money.	Maallaqa sana irratti sirrii ture.
It can go even higher.	Kana caalaa ol deemuu danda'a.
I don't know if that's good or bad.	Sun gaarii moo hamaa ta'uu hin beeku.
He should have known all along	Silaa yeroo hundumaa beekuu qaba ture
Not much else is right.	Wanti biraa baay'een sirrii miti.
You have just enough time.	Yeroo gahaa qofa qabda.
I’m not going to do that again	Ammas akkas gochuuf hin jiru
I couldn't stay here	As turuu hin dandeenye
I seem to be just like them	Anis akkuma isaanii fakkaata
I was right.	Sirrii jedheen ture.
I'm good about it.	Ani waa'ee kanaa gaarii dha.
That still doesn’t work.	Sun ammallee hin hojjetu.
But today was the worst day of his life.	Har'a garuu guyyaa jireenya isaa keessatti isa hamaa ture.
But that may not be what he meant.	Garuu wanti inni jechuu barbaade kana taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
Time and place.	Yeroo fi bakka.
I wanted to ask you about it.	Waa'ee isaa isin gaafachuu barbaade.
I have a few problems here.	Asitti rakkoo muraasa qaba.
Everything seems to be there.	Wanti hundi waan jiru fakkaata.
I wasn’t really in any mood for this.	Dhuguma kanaaf miira tokkollee keessa hin turre.
I can't believe my eyes	Ija koo amanuu hin danda'u
Many people have	Namoonni baay'een qaban
I am the voice of many without one	Ani tokko malee sagalee namoota hedduu
That goes both ways.	Sun karaa lamaan deema.
I mean, look outside	Ala ilaalaa jechuu kooti
I need help with this one.	Isa kanaan gargaarsa na barbaachisa.
It doesn't work very well.	Baay'ee hin hojjetu.
Who loves to live life.	Jireenya jiraachuu kan jaallatu.
I mean, that’s really not true at all	Kana jechuun koo, dhuguma sun tasumaa dhugaa miti
I'm sure you really know this.	Kana dhuguma akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
It should be, really.	Ta'uu qaba, dhuguma.
Then it will work.	Sana booda ni hojjeta.
But I was always waiting.	Garuu yeroo hunda eegaa ture.
Even, sometimes, a lot of money.	Illee, yeroo tokko tokko, maallaqa guddaa.
I need it here.	Asitti na barbaachisa.
I knew he was someone who would help me	Nama na gargaaru akka ta'e nan beeka ture
But they could be something else.	Garuu waan biraa ta'uu danda'u.
Even something great.	Waan guddaa illee.
You can see it in her eyes.	Ija ishee keessatti arguu dandeessa.
I'm sure of that	Sana mirkanaa'aa dha
He wanted food.	Nyaata barbaade.
You have no idea what it does.	Maal akka hojjetu yaada hin qabdu.
I think it went all the way through though	Karaa hunda keessa darbe natti fakkaata garuu
If you have to ask at all.	Yoo tasumaa gaafachuu qabda ta'e.
He is at home.	Inni mana jira.
It just doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu qofa.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.	Ani guutummaatti itti gammadeera.
I thought it was a good opportunity to do something new.	Waan haaraa hojjechuuf carraa gaarii natti fakkaate.
This is an important question.	Kun gaaffii barbaachisaa dha.
She was always such a good girl	Yeroo hundumaa intala gaarii akkasii ture
That's not what matters right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma miti.
He said this month.	Ji'a kana jedhe.
But that’s not necessary.	Garuu sun hin barbaachisu.
That has been clear for some time.	Sun yeroo muraasaaf ifa ta'ee jira.
He wanted to do the right thing	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjechuu barbaade
I don't want to see you.	Si arguu hin barbaadu.
She is ours.	Isheen kan keenya.
She, she, she.	Isheen, isheen, isheen.
He started walking towards him	Gara isaatti deemuu jalqabe
This was a good reason	Kun sababa gaarii ture
That’s just my little thing on it.	Sun waan xiqqoo koo isa irra jiru qofa.
I’m happy with my way	Karaa kootti gammadeera
You don't know about it.	Waa'ee isaa hin beektu.
It was a little before three in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii sadii dura xiqqoo ture.
He was then.	Inni yeroo sana ture.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
That stuff is in there.	Wanti sun achi keessa jira.
Very much obliged to you.	Baay'ee dirqama siif ta'e.
That’s it first of all.	Hunda dura kanuma.
She was reluctant to go with him.	Isa waliin deemuuf fedhii hin qabdu turte.
I knew better than that	Kana caalaa nan beeka ture
I have my good days and bad days	Guyyaa gaarii fi guyyaa hamaa koo qaba
This should not be one of those times.	Yeroon kun yeroo sana keessaa tokko ta'uu hin qabu.
But that one the other day was pretty good.	Garuu inni guyyaa darbe sun baayyee gaarii ture.
It's still on.	Ammallee irra jira.
It could have been something else.	Silaa waan biraa ta'uu danda'a ture.
He had no idea what to do with his hands.	Harka isaatiin maal akka godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
How did this thing happen.	Wanti kun akkamitti ta'e.
Sometimes that’s just it.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas qofa.
You never know where you are.	Bakka jirtu gonkumaa hin beektu.
That’s how people are.	Namoonni akkasitti jiru.
But things were different.	Garuu wanti jiru adda ture.
I knew it would happen.	Akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
He wanted to be outside	Ala ta'uu barbaade
But he looks so much like you.	Garuu inni akka malee si fakkaata.
Still, we better do what we can.	Ammas ta'ee waan dandeenyu yoo goonu wayya.
It wasn’t her.	Ishee hin turre.
I just wanted one thing.	Waan tokko qofa barbaade.
I thought maybe some	Tarii tokko tokko jedheen yaade
I wasn't about to let that happen	Ani akkas akka ta'uuf hin turre
I can't go along with that	Sana waliin deemuu hin danda'u
No one thinks that way.	Namni akkas yaadu hin jiru.
He is here now.	Amma as jira.
I love the idea of ​​it	Yaada isaa baay'een jaalladha
He should have known you could find her.	Silaa akka ati ishee argachuu dandeessu beekuu qaba ture.
He may not have one.	Tokko qabaachuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I just can't believe he's gone	Inni akka hin jirre qofa amanuu hin danda'u
I want everyone to love her.	Namni hundi akka ishee jaallatu nan barbaada.
I think they were just waiting for that to go away	Isaan deemuuf sana qofa eegaa turan jedheen yaada
I wasn’t so lucky at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas carraa hin qabu ture.
I thought he was really nice	Dhuguma nama gaarii natti fakkaate
It’s not too obvious, though.	Garmalee ifa miti garuu.
Then he got lucky.	Sana booda carraa argate.
Not.	Miti.
It’s not going to do anything at all.	Tasumaa homaa hojjechuuf hin deemu.
I didn't want to know that	Kana beekuu hin barbaanne
None in the whole house.	Mana guutuu keessa tokkollee hin jiru.
Not that they would know if it was him.	Osoo inni ta'e ni beeku jechuu miti.
I didn’t know this guy	Gurbaa kana hin beeku ture
It can handle anything you have.	Waan ati qabdu hunda danda'a.
But no one said anything.	Garuu namni homaa dubbate hin jiru.
I always think of you	Yeroo hundumaa si yaada
This time it’s better for me	Yeroo kana naaf wayya
I really wanted to go	Deemu baay'een barbaade
That was something else.	Sun waan biraa ture.
It all happened in a moment.	Hundi isaa yeroo muraasa keessatti ta'e.
I said I had no way.	Anis karaa hin qabu jedheen.
New job opportunities.	Carraa hojii haaraa.
You have no way of knowing whether it’s dangerous or not.	Balaa qabaachuu fi dhiisuu isaa karaa itti beektu hin qabdu.
I really need your help	Gargaarsa keessan baay'een barbaada
We can’t help this.	Kana gargaaruu hin dandeenyu.
You don’t have to do this.	Kana gochuun dirqama miti.
He is right here.	Asitti sirrii dha.
I’m really looking into this	Dhuguma kana ilaalaa jira
I was alone.	Ani kophaa koo ture.
I didn’t want to see it	Ani arguu hin barbaanne
Expect it to be nothing.	Homaa miti jettanii eegaa.
He really didn’t know what he was doing for a living	Dhuguma jireenya isaaf maal akka hojjetu hin beeku ture
I wish it wasn’t.	Osoo hin taane natti tola.
There is no such person.	Namni akkasii hin jiru.
You just might get it.	Tarii qofa argachuu dandeessa.
He looks a lot like you, you know.	Inni baayyee si fakkaata, beekta.
I thought he was a really nice guy	Dhuguma gurbaa gaarii natti fakkaate
I didn’t want to know anymore	Kana booda beekuu hin barbaanne
This is not the case.	Kun akkas miti.
He wanted a wife and many children	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee hedduu barbaada ture
I only saw him here once	Yeroo tokko qofa asitti isa arge
Tell them what they need to know.	Waan beekuu qaban itti himi.
It was another place and another time	Bakka biraa fi yeroo biraa ture
It certainly doesn’t seem that way.	Akkas akka hin fakkaatu beekamaadha.
He had no truth	Dhugaa tokkollee hin qabu ture
He has three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba.
I couldn't believe this was happening.	Kun ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye.
, but some are new.	, tokko tokko garuu haaraa dha.
I have to go	Ani deemuu qaba
I’ve been watching you.	Si ilaalaa tureera.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
After this week if that's anything.	Torban kana booda yoo sun homaa ta'e.
But no one there knows him	Achitti garuu namni isa beeku hin jiru
Just go backwards.	Duubatti deebi'uu qofa.
At one point I told him that wasn’t a good idea	Yeroo tokko sun yaada gaarii akka hin taane itti hime
Look at it like this.	Akkasitti ilaalaa.
I told him about the idea.	Anis waa'ee yaada sanaa itti hime.
There was a time.	Yeroon ni ture.
But, by then it was definitely too late.	Garuu, yeroo sanatti yeroon isaa akka darbe beekamaadha.
So we had two houses at the time.	Kanaaf yeroo sanatti mana lama qabna turre.
What do you do.	Maal gootu.
I have a problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoon qaba.
Nothing was a problem.	Wanti rakkoo hin turre.
It’s just not true.	Dhugaa miti qofa.
She would never know herself to be here.	As akka jiru gonkumaa of hin beektu turte.
He looked up at her.	Ol jedhee ilaale.
Going home so late.	Akkasitti yeroon booda gara manaatti deebi'uu.
But I shouldn’t say you should do otherwise.	Garuu kana malee gochuu qabda jechuu hin qabu.
This is really happening.	Kun dhuguma ta'aa jira.
I didn't even know what just happened	Waan amma ta'e illee hin beeku ture
She has no life.	Jireenya hin qabdu.
I have much more to say	Kana caalaa waanan jedhu hedduu qaba
Become for us.	Nuuf ta'aa.
It may not be the case.	Ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Someone she was like that.	Nama isheen akkas turte.
I couldn’t see them	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye
I didn’t want him to know	Akka inni beeku hin barbaanne
I knew then that the time was right	Yeroo sanatti yeroon isaa sirrii akka taʼe nan beeka ture
I wondered who would be sitting next to me	Eenyutu na bira taa'a jedheen yaade
But you are not like that.	Ati garuu akkas miti.
Not many were there	Baay'een achi hin turre
I can't really talk now	Amma dhuguma dubbachuu hin danda'u
I don’t know if there’s anything out there.	Wanti ala jiru jiraachuu hin beeku.
After what happened.	Waan ta'ee booda.
He had to have a chance.	Carraa argachuu qaba ture.
Some people like it	Namoonni tokko tokko ni jaallatu
That's where I want to be.	Bakka ta'uu barbaadu kanuma.
Couldn't comment	Yaada kennuu hin dandeenye
Two, he thought.	Lamaan jedhee yaade.
I’m glad it didn’t.	Akka hin taane gammadeera.
I can't tell you that	Ani akkas sitti himuu hin danda'u
I didn't see anything	Homaa hin argine
That’s obvious.	Sun ifaadha.
I need another drink.	Dhugaatii biraa na barbaachisa.
I have no idea what it will be.	Maal akka ta'u yaada hin qabu.
I want her here right now	Yeroo ammaa kana as ishee barbaada
I walked a long way home from school.	Mana barumsaa irraa karaa dheeraa gara manaatti deeme.
I will do whatever it takes to make that happen	Sana akka ta'uuf waan barbaachisu hunda nan godha
I can just eat it.	Nyaachuu qofa nan danda'a.
For a while I thought I had	Yeroo muraasaaf qaba jedheen yaade
He seems to have found someone who enjoyed it.	Nama itti gammade waan argate fakkaata.
That doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous.	Balaa hin qabu jechuu miti.
Three years later he is gone	Waggaa sadii booda hin jiru
It has been a great passion.	Fedhii guddaa ta'ee ture.
I can't do another one.	Kan biraa gochuu hin danda'u.
I still love your mother	Ammallee haadha kee nan jaalladha
Parents with children.	Warra ijoollee qaban.
They knew this was not their place.	Kun bakka isaanii akka hin taane ni beeku turan.
I knew she was with us	Nu waliin akka jirtu nan beeka ture
It was happening.	Ta'aa ture.
That’s how it should have been.	Akkas ta’uu qaba ture.
That’s too good to be true.	Sun garmalee gaarii dha.
I know what works for me	Waan naaf hojjetu nan beeka
I thought it would ever be enough for me	Yoomiyyuu naaf ta'a jedheen yaade
That can be a problem.	Sun rakkoo taʼuu dandaʼa.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
There is only one problem with her	Ishee waliin rakkoon tokko qofa
It’s not unique.	Adda miti.
It’s better for us than anything else	Hunda caalaa nuuf wayya
I shouldn't have said that stuff about your parents.	Silaa waa'ee warra kee waan sana dubbachuu hin qabu ture.
Wife and daughter.	Haadha manaa fi intala.
I am here against my will	Fedhii koo malee as jira
They are on and inside.	Irra fi keessa jiru.
I didn't know you meant that	Kana jechuu kee akka ta'e hin beeku ture
But it was not to be.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
Only one week!.	Torban tokko qofa!.
I didn’t know you were here	As akka jirtu hin beeku ture
No one had ever done that to him before.	Kanaan dura namni akkas isa godhe hin beeku.
We have to eat it.	Nyaachuu qabna.
Maybe that's their point.	Tarii yaada isaanii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
I think he loves her	Ishee jaallatu natti fakkaata
she said.	jette.
You never do it.	Ati gonkumaa hin gootu.
I didn’t want it to go any further.	Kana caalaa akka deemu hin barbaanne.
Everything else here is really nice.	Wanti biraa as jiru hundi dhuguma namatti tola.
He wants you.	Si barbaada.
He had some good ideas.	Yaada gaarii tokko tokko qaba ture.
That went really well.	Sun dhuguma akka gaariitti deeme.
I think he saw more than he said	Kan inni dubbate caalaa waan arge natti fakkaata
But it wasn't going to happen.	Garuu ta'uuf hin turre.
He has the money.	Maallaqa qaba.
I wonder if anyone can help	Namni gargaaruu danda'u jiraa jedheen yaada
I thought that was doing good.	Sun waan gaarii hojjechaa jira jedheen yaade.
I hope it wasn’t one of your people.	Namoota keessan keessaa tokko akka hin turre abdiin qaba.
Otherwise, not so much.	Yoo kana hin taane hangas miti.
He knew then that she was his mother	Haadha isaa akka taate yeroo sana beeka ture
It was really like that.	Dhuguma akkas ture.
No one asked you for anything good.	Waan gaarii namni si gaafate hin jiru.
I shouldn’t have even said anything	Silaa homaa dubbachuu illee hin qabu ture
I thought the same as you	Anis akkuma kee yaade
That came later.	Sun booda dhufe.
What was in him was here.	Wanti isa keessa ture as ture.
We have to earn our living, you know.	Jireenya keenya argachuu qabna beekta.
You are here now, in my house.	Amma as jirta, mana koo keessa.
I couldn't believe it	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye
But, of course, we certainly have nothing.	Garuu, beekamaadha, homaa akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
When she doesn’t have it.	Yeroo isheen hin qabne.
He almost had no time now	Amma yeroo hin qabu ture jechuun ni danda'ama
I thought he was doing better	Inni kana caalaa hojjechaa jira jedheen yaade
As you said, you can’t tell anyone.	Akkuma jette namatti himuu hin dandeessu.
It certainly did for me	Naaf akka godhe beekamaadha
Clearly, we are not.	Nuti akka hin taane ifaadha.
To go for it.	Isaaf deemuuf.
She was right.	Sirrii jettee turte.
I still didn’t want him to go	Ammallee akka inni deemu hin barbaanne
Obviously I was wrong.	Ani dogoggora akkan ture ifaadha.
I thought he was a man	Nama natti fakkaate
I think that’s my favorite thing	Sun waanan jaalladhu natti fakkaata
If, if, if.	Yoo, yoo, yoo.
I didn't tell him who he was	Ani eenyu akka ta'e itti hin himne
He is waiting outside your house	Mana keessan ala eegaa jira
But he went with his friends.	Inni garuu hiriyyoota isaa waliin deeme.
I have a bad feeling here	Asitti miira hamaa qaba
It has a name, you know	Maqaa qaba, beekta
That it's just one big thing.	Waan guddaa tokko qofa akka ta'e.
But what is it?.	Garuu maali?.
He wasn’t a bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa hin turre.
I mean, this is pretty new.	Kun baayyee haaraa dha jechuu kooti.
I just can't go back	Duubatti deebi'uu qofa hin danda'u
You are not a human being.	Ati nama miti.
But he never did.	Garuu gonkumaa hin goone.
I know all about my father	Waa'ee abbaa koo hunda nan beeka
This could have happened.	Kun ta'uu danda'a ture.
I want what you have	Waan ati qabdu nan barbaada
Which he didn’t understand.	Kan inni hin hubanne.
I can't be around you	Ani naannoo kee jiraachuu hin danda'u
I like simple things	Wantoota salphaa nan jaalladha
That much he knows.	Hanga kana inni beeka.
I couldn't go back to my room alone	Kophaa koo kutaa kootti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
I wonder how you know about it.	Akkamitti waa'ee isaa beekta jedheen yaada.
I can't go back to that house	Mana sanatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
I'm just too self-aware	Ani garmalee of beeka qofa
It worked for us.	Nuuf hojjete.
A daughter without a mother.	Intala haadha malee.
He was only three years old at the time.	Yeroo sanatti umuriin isaa sadii qofa ture.
The perfect one.	Kan guutuu ta'e.
It was a feeling.	Miira ture.
It wasn’t a great feeling.	Miira guddaa hin turre.
Ba'e.	Ba'e.
That didn’t last long though.	Sun garuu yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
It’s really completely unhelpful here	Dhuguma asitti guutummaatti gargaarsa hin qabu
I think you love me	Akka waan na jaallattu natti fakkaata
Just the money, please. 	Maallaqa qofa maaloo. 
Not from here.	As irraa miti.
But you have to keep going.	Garuu itti deemuun dirqama.
He probably did a lot.	Baay’ee kan inni godhe ta’uu hin oolu.
I was with my mother	Haadha koo waliin ture
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
She doesn't have time.	Yeroo hin qabdu.
She certainly wasn’t good enough for you.	Isheen siif gaarii akka hin turre beekamaadha.
People may not want you to.	Namoonni akka ati hin barbaanne taʼa.
They say this.	Kana jedhu.
But of course not.	Garuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It can happen, it will happen.	Ta'uu danda'a, ni ta'a.
I don’t mean to give it to us like that	Akkasitti nuuf kennuu jechuu koo miti
I’m not the only one who does this.	Kana kan godhu ana qofa miti.
And again and again.	Ammas ammas.
I can't tell you just yet	Yeroo ammaa kana qofa sitti himuu hin danda'u
Spot .	Bakka .
I haven’t seen them but they are there	Isaan hin argine garuu achi jiru
It shouldn't be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu hin qabu.
But I didn’t see any.	Garuu tokkollee hin argine.
Everything became possible.	Wanti hundi ni danda’ama ta’e.
She had to go back.	Deebi'uu qabdi turte.
That must be a lot of money.	Sun maallaqa guddaa ta'uu qaba.
I know you have a lot to offer	Waan baay'ee akka qabdu nan beeka
I had no idea she could play like that	Akkasitti taphachuu akka dandeessu yaada hin qabu ture
I wanted to do something new	Waan haaraa hojjechuu barbaade
Now was the chance to say something.	Amma carraan waan tokko dubbachuu ture.
She needed a job.	Hojii ishee barbaachisa ture.
He was such a good man.	Nama gaarii akkasii ture.
It must be just the two of us.	Nu lamaan qofa ta'uu qaba.
I can't even talk about it with them	Isaan waliin illee waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
We really need to stop doing that.	Dhuguma sana gochuu dhiisuu qabna.
I couldn't stay here.	As turuu hin dandeenye.
I wanted everything to go well	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti akka deemu nan barbaada ture
You will love it.	Ni jaallattu.
I really didn’t need one.	Dhuguma tokko na hin barbaachifne.
I really don't have it.	Dhuguma hin qabu.
I don’t mean to yell at you	Sitti iyyuu jechuu koo miti
That is not necessary.	Sun hin barbaachisu.
I know she means well	Akka gaariitti jechuu ishee nan beeka
Love it again.	Ammas jaalladhu.
Which is not the case.	Kan hin taane.
This would never work.	Kun gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
In a severe environment this may not be the case.	Naannoo hamaa keessatti kun ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I know it’s not bad	Hamaa akka hin taane nan beeka
He wanted to leave her alone	Kophaa ishee dhiisuu barbaade
You have a voice for him.	Isaaf sagalee qabda.
I know what is happening inside you.	Waan keessa kee ta'aa jiru nan beeka.
They always do a great job	Yeroo hundumaa hojii guddaa hojjetu
Not a good answer.	Deebii gaarii miti.
I couldn't do anything	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
He knows me so well.	Inni akka malee na beeka.
Clearly, something was wrong.	Wanti tokko dogoggora akka taʼe ifaadha.
I couldn’t have done it otherwise.	Silaa akkas ta’ee gochuu hin danda’u ture.
So that’s how it was.	Kanaaf akkas ture.
I can't stay here any longer	Kana booda as turuu hin danda'u
It wasn't something he liked to do very often.	Waan yeroo baay'ee hojjechuu jaallatu hin turre.
He wanted to know what happened in there	Waan achi keessa ta'e beekuu barbaade
They are not entirely wrong.	Isaan guutummaatti dogoggora hin qaban.
Your car, someone said.	Konkolaataa keessan jedhe namni tokko.
I know you love it there	Achitti akka jaallattu nan beeka
I thought nothing was happening around me.	Naannoo kootti wanti ta'aa jiru waan hin jirre natti fakkaate.
I thought it came across well.	Akka gaariitti waan dhufe natti fakkaate.
It's going to be bad.	Hamaa ta'a.
I want to be with you, all of you	Si waliin, hunda keessan waliin ta'uu barbaada
Not that something happened.	Wanti tokko ta'e jechuu miti.
Please be like that.	Mee akkas ta'aa.
It really doesn’t matter.	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
On the house.	Mana irratti.
I want to apologize for the same	Anis kanuma dhiifama gaafachuu barbaada
He was going to help her.	Ishee gargaaruuf ture.
But that rarely happens.	Garuu akkas yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
I wasn’t in his mood	Ani miira isaa keessa hin turre
They were very funny about it.	Waa'ee kanaa baay'ee qoosaa turan.
They were there, of course.	Isaan achi akka turan beekamaadha.
I couldn't believe what had happened	Waan ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
But it really isn’t.	Garuu dhuguma akkas miti.
Not much though.	Baay'ee miti garuu.
He should know he won’t do it again	Ammas akka hin goone beekuu qaba
All this stuff.	Wanti kana hunda.
I love that sort of thing	Waan akkasii nan jaalladha
But it’s not me.	Garuu ana miti.
Not his mother, not his father.	Haadha isaa miti, abbaa isaa miti.
Sorry, this opportunity no longer exists.	Dhiifama, carraan kun kana booda hin jiru.
You can stay here.	Asitti turuu dandeessu.
He never was.	Inni gonkumaa hin turre.
I love those guys.	Warra sana nan jaalladha.
I still had no idea what to tell him	Ammallee maal akkan itti himu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
As it always was, perhaps.	Akkuma yeroo hundumaa ture, tarii.
Just like you said.	Akkuma ati jette.
I don't know what to do.	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
It doesn’t really matter where you are.	Bakka jirtu dhuguma homaa hin qabu.
That’s how it all started.	Hundi akkasitti jalqabe.
I go by a lot of names	Maqaa baay'een deema
I don't think about her.	Ani waa'ee ishee hin yaadu.
I think it was a mistake for him	Isaaf dogoggora ture jedheen yaada
But that didn’t matter.	Garuu sun homaa hin turre.
He was the real one.	Inni dhugaa ture.
I would have known then that this was not right	Kun sirrii akka hin taane silaa yeroo sana beeka ture
She was like that once.	Yeroo tokko akkas turte.
Now he has a completely different life	Amma jireenya guutummaatti adda ta'e qaba
I will never tell anyone what happened here tonight.	Halkan kana waan asitti ta'e gonkumaa namatti hin himu.
He will always be with us	Inni yeroo hundumaa nu waliin ni jiraata
Not really doing anything.	Dhuguma homaa gochuu miti.
He knew exactly what he was doing	Waan inni godhu sirriitti beeka ture
It meant trouble.	Rakkoo jechuu ture.
I didn't tell him anything	Ani homaa itti hin himne
He was always in the house	Yeroo hunda mana keessa ture
It’s not a bad feeling.	Miira hamaa miti.
I want to go home now	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaada
You don’t want me here.	As akkan jiru hin barbaaddu.
Consider the situation of the homeless.	Mee haala namoota mana hin qabne ilaalaa.
We have to leave it there.	Achitti dhiisuu qabna.
I still hadn’t forgiven him	Ammallee dhiifama isaaf hin goone ture
It's very good.	Baay'ee gaarii dha.
That didn’t last long.	Sun yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
They are great at this.	Isaan kana irratti guddaa dha.
But what one can do.	Garuu waan namni tokko gochuu danda'u.
There was no reason he had.	Sababni inni qabu hin turre.
But to me it is different.	Ana bira garuu adda.
Nothing in a year.	Waggaa tokko keessatti homaa hin jiru.
Looks like there must be something here.	Asitti waan tokko jiraachuu qaba fakkaata.
But we were waiting.	Garuu eegaa turre.
I looked at the lights near my door	Ifa naannoo balbala kootti jiru ilaale
But, it only worked in one case.	Garuu, dhimma tokko qofa irratti hojjete.
We need everyone to do this.	Kana gochuuf nama hunda nu barbaachisa.
Kee his mother.	Kee haadha isaa.
He was in something.	Waan tokko keessa ture.
So he was right after all.	Kanaaf hundumaa booda sirrii ture.
I wish this never happened	Kun yoomiyyuu osoo hin taane natti tola
But you’re lucky.	Garuu ati carraa qabda.
No one is interested.	Namni fedhii qabu hin jiru.
It doesn't matter now.	Amma dhimma hin qabu.
I mean, things are pretty much the same now.	Ammas wanti jiru baay'ee wal fakkaata jechuu kooti.
I need them both.	Isaan lamaan na barbaachisa.
But that was all it was, a disaster.	Garuu kana qofa ture, balaa.
I was a bad girl	Ani intala hamaa ture
What was happening in your house.	Waan mana keessan keessa ta'aa ture.
I thought, today is going to be a good day	Anis yaade, har'a guyyaa gaarii ta'uuf deema
It's just right.	Sirrii qofa.
If she hesitates .	Yoo isheen duubatti jette .
Their time is now.	Yeroon isaanii amma.
She was someone else.	Isheen nama biraa turte.
I didn’t want to stop being with him	Isa waliin jiraachuu dhiisuu hin barbaanne
Some of them are pretty obvious.	Isaan keessaa tokko tokko baayyee ifaadha.
I don’t think this was good.	Kun gaarii ture natti hin fakkaatu.
It took him a month.	Ji'a tokko itti fudhate.
I will never do that again	Kana booda gonkumaa akkas hin godhu
Sometimes, that may not matter.	Yeroo tokko tokko, sun dhimma hin qabu taʼa.
Maybe she wasn't, he thought.	Tarii isheen hin taane ta'a jedhee yaade.
I really can't live like this any longer	Dhuguma kana caalaa akkasitti jiraachuu hin danda'u
He must be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu qaba.
But that’s it, just the two of us.	Garuu kanuma, nu lamaan qofa.
I couldn't have done it without you	Si malee gochuu hin danda'u ture
I wanted to go to her	Gara ishee deemuun barbaade
So I thought you wanted me to help	Kanaaf akkan gargaaru barbaaddu jedheen yaade
I want to do that now.	Amma akkas gochuu nan barbaada.
You are the truth.	Ati dhugaa kanuma.
I thought it already existed	Duraan jira jedheen yaada ture
He may be the one.	Inni ta'uu danda'a.
Not really my area of ​​interest.	Dhuguma naannoo fedhii koo miti.
said.	jedhe.
I will never tell anyone what you said	Waan ati jette gonkumaa namatti hin himu
I think something might happen soon	Yeroo dhiyootti wanti tokko ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
That much is obvious.	Hamma kana ifaadha.
In a past life he could have been a teacher	Jireenya darbe keessatti barsiisaa ta'uu danda'a ture
I didn't know this place	Bakka kana hin beekne
I couldn’t find anything that would tell me that.	Waan akkas natti himu tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
Just like in the past.	Akkuma durii.
Now I know you love me	Amma akka ati na jaallattu nan beeka
They are not right.	Isaan sirrii miti.
I wasn’t enough.	Ani gahaa hin turre.
I have no money at all.	Maallaqa tasumaa hin qabu.
I was trying to do my job	Hojii koo hojjechuuf yaalaa ture
I’m more interested in you.	Ani kana caalaa siif fedhii qaba.
More is better, to an extent.	Caalaatti wayya, hanga tokko.
I just really want you	Dhuguma si barbaada qofa
We have two issues.	Dhimma lama qabna.
Otherwise, there is none.	Yoo kana hin taane hin jiru.
That may no longer be the case.	Kana booda akkas taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
But she usually doesn't do it at night.	Garuu yeroo baayyee halkan hin gootu.
I don’t want anything more	Kana caalaa homaa hin barbaadu
He knew she had been in there.	Isheen achi keessa akka turte ni beeka ture.
But they are not the same.	Garuu isaan tokko miti.
He couldn't do it again	Ammas gochuu hin dandeenye
The exception, of course	Kan adda ta'e beekamaadha
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
I know it's all true	Hundi isaa dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka
I have been working on this for a long, long time.	Kana irratti yeroo dheeraaf yeroo dheeraaf hojjechaa tureera.
She wasn’t the only mother in the crowd	Namoota keessaa haadha qofa hin turre
I couldn't find this.	Kana argachuu hin dandeenye.
' at '.	' itti '.
Perhaps the most important thing.	Tarii wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe taʼuu dandaʼa.
There is no obvious reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni ifa ta’e hin jiru.
It has people in every hold	Qabduu hunda keessatti namoota qaba
This time the real one	Yeroo kana kan dhugaa
He was trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa ture.
They must be.	Ta'uu qabu.
I am not my clothes.	Ani uffata koo miti.
I can't answer him	Isaaf deebii kennuu hin danda'u
Not like himself today.	Har'a akka ofii miti.
It was pretty obvious why.	Maaliif akka ta'e baay'ee ifa ture.
I can be their father	Ani abbaa isaanii ta'uu nan danda'a
I know that feeling all too well	Miira sana akka gaariitti nan beeka
We need to be clear.	Ifa ta'uu qabna.
I can't seem to get enough!.	Waan gahaa argachuu hin danda'u natti fakkaata!.
Is.	Dha.
He was a boy.	Inni gurbaa ture.
Obviously not necessary.	Barbaachisaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
I went inside, too.	Anis keessa deeme.
There is nothing real.	Wanti dhugaa hin jiru.
I told him everything	Waan hundumaa itti hime
I didn’t realize he was up there the whole time	Yeroo guutuu achi ol akka ture hin hubanne
Really love them.	Dhuguma isaan jaalladhu.
No one knew where she was.	Eessa akka jirtu namni beeku hin turre.
I didn't understand that.	Akkasitti naaf hin galle.
I wasn’t necessarily.	Ani dirqama hin turre.
I shouldn’t say no one, except a few	Nama hin qabu jechuu hin qabu, muraasa malee
This is the one.	Kun isa.
I thought they would be after us	Nu booda ni ta'u jedheen yaade
Now it's ours.	Amma kan keenya.
He was absolutely right.	Inni guutummaatti sirrii ture.
I knew he was there for me	Naaf akka jiru nan beeka ture
He should have stayed with her longer	Silaa yeroo dheeraa ishee bira turuu qaba ture
They are in my hands now.	Amma harka koo keessa jiru.
I didn’t always know this	Yeroo hundumaa kana hin beeku ture
I think about the house.	Waa'ee manaa nan yaada.
I want someone else to do it.	Namni biraa akka godhu nan barbaada.
All that kind of stuff.	Wantoota akkasii hunda.
But we have a problem.	Garuu rakkoo qabna.
I think you're right	Ati sirrii natti fakkaata
It became very dangerous	Baay'ee balaa ta'e
You know that it is.	Akka ta'e ni beekta.
I can't make you think that	Akkas akka yaaddu gochuu hin danda'u
It's probably a nickname.	Maqaa maqaa ijoollee ta'uu hin oolu.
It was more of a disaster.	Kana caalaa balaa ture.
I can't even do that.	Sana illee gochuu hin danda'u.
What happened was simple.	Wanti ta'e salphaa ture.
He was a dangerous guy	Gurbaa balaa qabu ture
Maybe a few.	Tarii muraasa.
It's happening a lot more.	Baayyee caalaa ta'aa jira.
I don’t want to comment on something that doesn’t exist.	Waan hin jirre yaada kennuu hin barbaadu.
There, she had said.	Achitti, jettee turte.
I never could.	Ani gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
I think we need to go somewhere	Bakka deemuu qabna jedheen yaada
I had no idea there was anything going on	Waan tokko akka jiru yaada hin qabu ture
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
To make you whole again	Ammas guutuu si gochuuf
I know it’s not that easy a task	Hojii hangas salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
There is no reason why.	Sababni itti ta'u hin jiru.
It’s not going to work anymore.	Kana booda hojjechuuf hin deemu.
They are our friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota keenya.
As it happened before.	Akkuma duraan ta'e.
There could be more, but there should be this much.	Kana caalaa jiraachuu danda’a, garuu hamma kana jiraachuu qaba.
I'm not here.	Ani as hin jiru.
This was nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa hin turre.
None of them are there.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
He was a little thing.	Inni waan xiqqoo ture.
It looks bad.	Hamaa fakkaata.
I knew it was coming	Akka dhufu nan beeka ture
That’s why they were all there.	Hundi isaanii kanaaf turan.
I think a lot of it is obvious	Waan baay'een isaa ifa natti fakkaata
I left saying it was ours.	Kan keenya jedheen ba'e.
I mean, a year ago nobody wanted him.	Waggaa tokko dura namni isa barbaadu hin turre jechuu kooti.
As he can.	Akkuma inni danda'u.
Maybe it's just like this	Tarii akkuma kana ta'uu danda'a
That is not the case.	Sun akkas miti.
But none of them had an answer.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee deebii hin qabu ture.
Serious car accident	Balaa konkolaataa hamaa
That might work.	Sun hojjechuu danda'a.
Those are really good.	Isaan sun dhuguma gaarii dha.
There was no one.	Namni hin turre.
I know you won’t do that	Akkas akka hin goone nan beeka
I didn’t want to do it	Ani gochuu hin barbaanne
Then the boys walked inside.	Sana booda gurbaa keessa deeme.
He had so much, so much, to think about	Waan baay'ee, baay'ee, kan itti yaadu qaba ture
They had no father, no mother.	Abbaa hin qaban, haadha hin qaban turan.
I knew what you did to him	Waan ati isa irratti goote nan beeka ture
He didn’t have anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I told him what I thought	Anis yaada koo itti hime
It wasn’t working at the time.	Yeroo sanatti hojjechaa hin turre.
I didn’t think you had it in you	Si keessa waan qabdu natti hin fakkaatu ture
I saw her, she was with someone.	Ishee arge, nama tokko waliin turte.
I went upstairs to my room	Anis gara kutaa kootti ol ba'e
I mean, all of us	Hundi keenya jechuu kooti
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
I didn’t see any of them.	Tokkollee hin argine.
He did it entirely on his own.	Guutummaatti ofuma isaatiin hojjete.
I can tell you who you are	Eenyu akka taate sitti himuu nan danda'a
Three times he said to himself.	Yeroo sadii ofitti jedhe.
But I can't believe he did	Kana godhe garuu amanuu hin danda'u
Which we were.	Kan turre.
I wondered if that was true	Sun dhugaa taʼuu isaa nan yaade
Maybe, maybe, it was the right thing to do.	Tarii, tarii, waan sirrii ta’e ture.
So there seemed to be an opportunity there.	Kanaaf carraan achi jiru fakkaata ture.
I was happy to be with her	Ishee wajjin taʼuu kootti gammadeera
Just about a good time.	Waa'ee yeroo gaarii qofa.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
Not sure if it's true or not	Dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti
There is no one else.	Namni biraa hin jiru.
It is dangerous, of course.	Balaa akka qabu beekamaadha.
I don't want to go back there.	Achitti deebi'uu hin barbaadu.
I thought so	Akkas jedheen yaade
I didn’t know them at the time	Yeroo sanatti isaan hin beeku ture
He didn't have time	Yeroo hin qabu ture
A lot of things can happen.	Wanti baay'een ta'uu danda'a.
I thought she was in danger	Balaa keessa waan jirtu natti fakkaate
I could see right through them	Karaa isaanii sirriitti arguu nan dandaʼa ture
I can do better than you	Si caalaa hojjechuu nan danda'a
I thought you wanted to	Ati waan barbaaddu natti fakkaate
I can't believe you would do that to me.	Akkas na gootu jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
Work.	Hojii.
He started everything.	Inni waan hundumaa jalqabe.
Which is very real.	Kan baayyee dhugaa ta'e.
Good and good.	Gaarii fi gaarii.
But you said nothing.	Ati garuu homaa hin dubbanne.
I want you to love me	Akka ati na jaallattu nan barbaada
I want to live life with her	Jireenya ishee waliin jiraachuu barbaada
I don't want to live	Ani jiraachuu hin barbaadu
And I had to do it.	Anis gochuun qaba ture.
But tonight, something was wrong.	Garuu halkan kana, wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
He needs to know it’s not her in there.	Achi keessa ishee akka hin taane beekuu qaba.
I think that's all	Kana qofa ta'a jedheen yaada
I couldn’t think of anything else to do	Waan biraa hojjechuuf yaadu hin dandeenye
Not by himself.	Ofii isaatiin miti.
I thought he was pretty good	Inni baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate
Do we really need another one?.	Dhuguma kan biraa nu barbaachisa?.
I was waiting a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa eegaa ture.
I knew it wasn’t him	Isa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
It’s my life.	Jireenya kooti.
If something goes wrong.	Yoo wanti tokko dogoggora ta'e.
Just simple things we have in common	Wantoota salphaa nuti wal fakkaatu qofa
My only hope was that he got my vote.	Abdiin koo sagalee koo argate qofa ture.
That said, it really was pretty big here.	Kana jechuun, dhuguma asitti baayyee guddaa ture.
They used to love her.	Duraan ishee jaallatu turan.
Just the two of you.	Isin lamaan qofa.
I thought, it’s time	jedheen yaade, yeroon isaa amma
Everything you need to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu hunda.
The work is very, very clear.	Hojiin baayyee baayyee ifaadha.
He didn’t need it anymore	Kana booda isa hin barbaachisu ture
I would have known him	Silaa isa beeka ture
It may just be noise here.	Asitti sagalee qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I hope there are no problems	Rakkoon akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
I didn’t see that coming.	Dhufuu sana hin argine.
Probably very good.	Tarii baayyee gaarii ta'a.
I love you, you know that	Si jaalladha, ati kana beekta
This was inexcusable.	Kun dhiifama kan hin qabne ture.
But it’s just not like that.	Garuu akkas miti qofa.
He had no idea what he could do	Maal gochuu akka dandaʼu yaada hin qabu ture
But how should he know.	Garuu akkamitti beekuu qaba.
Consider the answer.	Mee deebii kana ilaalaa.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
But that probably wasn't going to happen.	Garuu sun tarii ta'uuf hin turre.
But she was his only.	Isheen garuu kan isaa qofa turte.
More often than you think.	Yeroo baayyee kan ati yaaddu caalaa.
Where it wasn’t ours	Bakka kan keenya hin turre
So far you are doing a good job with me.	Hanga ammaatti hojii gaarii na waliin hojjechaa jirta.
They are making fun of me so much.	Akka malee natti qoosaa jiru.
This was true until very recently.	Kun hanga yeroo baayyee dhiyootti dhugaa ture.
Luck was with us.	Carraan nu waliin ture.
I don’t do this like that	Ani akkas kana hin godhu
I know what can happen on a night like that	Halkan akkasii maaltu ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka
I can't have enough of him	Isa gahaa qabaachuu hin danda'u
You never did it.	Ati gonkumaa hin goone.
I was three years old at the time	Yeroo sanatti umuriin koo waggaa sadii ture
Again, not necessarily a bad thing.	Ammas, dirqama waan hamaa miti.
I was extremely happy	Garmalee gammadeera
He had some old jobs	Hojii durii tokko tokko qabaa ture
It will be good for him.	Isaaf gaarii ta'a.
I know this will be her favorite	Kun waan isheen jaallattu akka ta'u nan beeka
Great, just perfect.	Guddaa, guutuu qofa.
I didn't understand anything about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa naaf hin galle.
It becomes necessary first.	Dura barbaachisaa ta’a.
I couldn’t get any answers though	Deebii tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye garuu
That was really something else.	Kana jechuun dhuguma waan biraa ture.
He wasn’t the only one.	Inni qofa hin turre.
That’s probably not the case.	Sun ta’uu hin oolu.
It was too long.	Garmalee dheeraa ture.
I know there has to be a problem	Rakkoon jiraachuu akka qabu nan beeka
I know a few people like that	Namoota akkasii muraasa nan beeka
I would love to do that to you	Akkas si gochuun baay'een jaalladha
They love each other.	Wal jaallatu.
He must know what will happen	Waan ta'u beekuu qaba
It was all bad.	Hundi isaa hamaa ture.
I already knew about that one	Waa'ee isa sanaa duruu beeka ture
I want you here.	Asitti si barbaada.
This is what you want.	Wanti ati barbaaddu kana.
Maybe you just can't do it anymore.	Tarii kana booda gochuu hin dandeessu qofa ta'a.
We can’t say what’s best for you here.	Asitti maaltu siif wayya jechuu hin dandeenyu.
I love my house.	Mana koo nan jaalladha.
I have my reasons for doing this	Kana gochuuf sababa koo qaba
I want you in my life so badly	Jireenya koo keessatti akka malee si barbaada
They know what they were doing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti maal hojjechaa akka turan ni beeku.
I wouldn't have gone otherwise	Osoo akkas ta'ee hin deemu ture
So he gave me your book.	Kanaaf kitaaba kee naaf kenne.
But something had happened.	Garuu wanti tokko ta'ee ture.
That's probably my biggest one.	Sun kan koo isa guddaa ta'uu hin oolu.
Fortunately, that wasn't the case.	Akka carraa ta'ee akkas hin turre.
A new life.	Jireenya haaraa.
You were here.	Ati as turte.
But not soon enough.	Garuu dafee miti.
I still could not believe that it really happened	Ammallee dhuguma akka taʼe amanuu hin dandeenye
He wanted to see him again	Ammas isa arguu barbaade
I'm waiting for something to happen	Waan tokko ta'u eegaa jira
I know he loves the feeling of being inside me	Miira keessa koo jiraachuu isaa akka jaallatu nan beeka
I always thought there would be time	Yeroo hundumaa yeroon ni jira jedheen yaada ture
They come from within.	Keessaa dhufu.
I don't understand what just happened	Waan amma ta'e naaf hin galle
I think this might be my new favorite place.	Kun bakka haaraa jaalladhu ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada.
She still had it.	Ammas qabdi turte.
I am not him.	Ani isa miti.
It looked very real.	Baayyee dhugaa fakkaata ture.
It’s not like we were together.	Akka waliin turre miti.
I couldn’t live where you were	Bakka ati jirtu jiraachuu hin dandeenye
It must be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu qaba.
It’s not good anymore.	Kana booda gaarii miti.
I didn't think about all this	Dhimma kana hunda hin yaadne
The good old days.	Bara gaarii durii.
This is a good house.	Kun mana gaarii dha.
I won’t say it was easy	Salphaa ture hin jedhu
He got it right.	Inni sirriitti argate.
They are your children.	Isaan ijoollee keessan.
I think he should come back soon	Dafee deebi'uu qaba jedheen yaada
I told him everything for nothing	Waan hundumaa homaa malee itti hime
I don't do this.	Ani kana hin godhu.
I think people should buy their own books.	Namoonni kitaaba ofii bitachuu qabu jedheen yaada.
We need to do more on this.	Kana irratti kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
There were very few people.	Namoonni baayyee muraasa turan.
They were very optimistic.	Abdii guddaa qaban turan.
Now it’s different.	Amma adda.
He wants to be human	Nama ta'uu barbaada
Everyone has enough of everything.	Namni hundi waan hundumaa gahaa qaba.
I thought it was a matter of will	Dhimma fedhii natti fakkaate
I can't believe I didn't tell you	Sitti hin himne jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
She needs to see him now.	Amma isa arguu qabdi.
I know that's a lot of money	Sun maallaqa guddaa akka ta'e nan beeka
Same place, same time.	Bakka wal fakkaatu, yeroo wal fakkaatu.
A few weeks later he was gone	Torban muraasa booda inni hin jiru ture
He looked at my hand again	Ammas harka koo ilaale
I wanted to do the same.	Anis akkas gochuu barbaade.
I didn’t want to know, not really.	Ani beekuu hin barbaanne, dhuguma miti.
And yet it happened! 	Ammas ta'ee!
. . . .	.
But I can't tell him that	Ani garuu akkas itti himuu hin danda'u
It should never have happened.	Gonkumaa akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
He is a very good teacher.	Barsiisaa baayyee gaarii dha.
I absolutely love mine	Kan koo guutummaatti nan jaalladha
I know you still have it.	Ammallee akka qabdu nan beeka.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
It was all, most likely, true.	Hundi isaa, baay’ee hin oolu, dhugaa ture.
It would have been great.	Silaa guddaa ta'a.
I didn’t see your car	Konkolaataa kee hin argine
I think they do a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjetu natti fakkaata.
I know you, of course	Ani si beeka, beekamaadha
Maybe someone here can tell me what happened.	Tarii namni as jiru maaltu akka ta'e natti himuu danda'a.
I can't stay on him any longer	Kana caalaa isa irratti turuu hin danda'u
You are too emotional.	Garmalee miira keessa jirta.
That is a possibility.	Sun taʼuu dandaʼa.
A lot of work is still needed	Ammas hojiin baay'een barbaachisa
He can be a good guy.	Inni nama gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
Certainly not now.	Amma akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I really didn't want to be that guy.	Dhuguma gurbaa sana ta'uu hin barbaanne.
Look at this place.	Bakka kana ilaalaa.
Like, a whole lot more.	Akka, guutummaatti baay'ee caalaa.
And I just couldn’t see it	Anis arguu hin dandeenye qofa
I don't know anything about it	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku
He wanted me.	Inni na barbaade.
Just like you just did.	Akkuma amma goote.
I have nothing in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti homaa hin qabu
I mean, you know that	Kana ni beektu jechuu kooti
I just thought about it	Anis itti yaade qofa
It doesn't matter why.	Maaliif akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
After that, the job was much easier.	Sana booda hojiin baayyee salphaa ture.
That wasn’t how we worked.	Akkasitti hojjenne hin turre.
I wanted to be myself	Ani ofii koo ta'uu barbaade
He did the job.	Hojii sana hojjete.
I couldn't see that happening	Akkas ta'uu isaa arguu hin dandeenye
He wasn’t there for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi hin turre.
You must have just been working too hard.	Garmalee hojjechaa turte qofa ta'uu qaba.
I know almost nothing about them	Waa'ee isaanii homaa hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama
But there is nothing else.	Waan biraa garuu hin jiru.
I didn’t really know him though	Ani garuu dhuguma isa hin beeku ture
But nothing is coming.	Garuu wanti dhufu hin jiru.
I don’t think he likes her	Ishee jaallatu natti hin fakkaatu
I'm the highway.	Ani karaa guddaa sanaa.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
A great man.	Nama guddaa.
He did not say where he was.	Eessa akka jiru hin dubbanne.
Most of the time this does not work.	Yeroo baayyee kun hin hojjetu.
She was tall.	Isheen dheeraa turte.
It can still be done.	Ammas gochuun ni danda’ama.
Three weeks passed.	Torban sadii darbe.
Now he had no shoes.	Amma kophee hin qabu ture.
But you can’t have it both ways.	Garuu karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
There was so much he didn't know.	Waan inni hin beekne baay'ee ture.
That is a very good thing.	Sun waan baayyee gaarii dha.
I knew nothing about cars	Waa'ee konkolaataa homaa hin beeku ture
I can't say who it was.	Eenyu akka ture dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I should be out there	Ani achi ala ta'uu qaba
Probably just as likely.	Tarii akkuma kana ta'uu hin oolu.
We don’t do this.	Kana hin goonu.
First that hasn’t happened yet.	Dura kan ammallee hin taane.
So you.	Kanaaf ati.
It was still a very big risk.	Ammallee balaa baayyee guddaa ture.
I just know that way well	Karaa sana sirriitti beeka qofa
You knew that.	Kana beekta turte.
They are the problem.	Isaan rakkoo jiru.
It says that.	Akkas jedha.
He did it.	Ni godhe.
I didn't think this would happen until now	Hanga ammaatti kun ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
I knew we needed them though	Isaan akka nu barbaachisu nan beeka ture garuu
It had its time and place	Yeroo fi bakka isaa qaba ture
Just the truth, please.	Dhugaa qofa, mee.
I have always loved her very much	Yeroo hundumaa baay'een ishee jaalladha ture
This was important to him	Kun isaaf barbaachisaa ture
I can really make this work.	Dhuguma kana akka hojjetu gochuu nan danda'a.
I thought you were your mother	Ati haadha kee natti fakkaate
Looks like a possible year.	Bara ta'uu danda'u fakkaata.
I couldn’t ask her any questions	Gaaffii tokkollee ishee gaafachuu hin dandeenye
One thing is clear to me.	Wanti tokko naaf ifaadha.
I just have to ask you for a little favor	Tola xiqqoo qofa si gaafachuu qaba
Like many others.	Akkuma hedduu.
But this was the worst of the worst.	Garuu kun isa hamaa keessaa isa hamaa ture.
So I wasn’t in the mood	Kanaaf miira keessa hin turre
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
I think pretty badly	Ani baay'ee hamaa ta'ee nan yaada
But that was terrible, you know.	Garuu sun waan hamaa ture, beekta.
It's not just about having friends and being nice.	Hiriyyoota qabaachuu fi nama gaarii ta'uu qofa miti.
I still want it and you still have it	Ammallee barbaada ati ammallee qabda
He was very lucky.	Baayyee carraa qaba ture.
I like that to be true	Sun dhugaa ta'ee natti tola
You don’t know any of them well.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee akka gaariitti hin beektu.
I need you to do me a favor	Tola akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa
He is sure of it.	Inni mirkanaa'aa dha.
I really think so.	Dhuguma akkas natti fakkaata.
I know who he’s with	Eenyu waliin akka jiru nan beeka
I had no other idea	Yaada biraa hin qabu ture
I couldn't tell the truth	Dhugaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye
I’m looking at them.	Isaan ilaalaa jira.
That’s the important part.	Sun kutaa barbaachisaa dha.
I wasn’t good enough	Ani gaarii hin turre
Being the best.	Kan caalaa ta'uu.
He would have been there three days	Silaa guyyaa sadii achi ture
Clearly, that could be the case.	Akkas ta’uu akka danda’u ifaadha.
Glad to see the light in them	Ifa isaan keessa jiru arguu kootti gammadeera
I wasn’t going without them	Isaan malee deemaa hin turre
We have the other hand.	Harka biraa qabna.
They had a way with clothes.	Uffata waliin karaa qabu turan.
I wish he never did.	Yoomiyyuu akka hin goone natti tola.
I want to know more about you	Waa'ee keessan caalaatti beekuu barbaada
I wanted to tell him	Anis itti himuu barbaade
You're still at home.	Ammas mana jirta.
He was really right about you	Dhuguma waa'ee kee sirrii ture
Otherwise very similar.	Yoo kana hin taane baayyee wal fakkaata.
I hope you can see me later	Booda na arguu akka dandeessu abdiin qaba
But it won't be long.	Garuu dheeraa hin ta'u.
When it doesn’t work, it doesn’t feel good.	Yeroo hin hojjenne miira gaarii hin qabu.
We didn't get to see each other much.	Wal arguu baayyee hin dandeenye.
I love this person.	Nama kana nan jaalladha.
But this can’t be right.	Garuu kun sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u.
I am a wife and a mother.	Ani haadha manaa fi haadha.
I have a feeling he doesn't even care about me anymore.	Kana booda waa'ee koo illee akka hin yaadne miira qaba.
Throughout the year.	Waggaa guutuu.
But it wasn’t easy.	Garuu salphaa hin turre.
I mean, just look at me	Na ilaalaa qofa jechuu kooti
I saw him on the road, though	Karaa irratti isa arge, garuu
We were home this time.	Yeroo kana mana turre.
But it’s not this one.	Garuu isa kana miti.
Just a few moments, please.	Yeroo muraasa qofa maaloo.
I couldn’t ask myself that.	Waan akkasii of gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
Cause !.	Sababa !.
I know two of them	Isaan keessaa lama beeka
That shouldn't be much of a problem.	Sun rakkoo guddaa ta'uu hin qabu.
This is happening now.	Kun amma waan ta'aa jira.
This person must be exposed	Nama kana ifa gochuun dirqama
That was good enough.	Sun gaarii ture.
I didn’t mean that though	Ani garuu akkas jechuu koo hin turre
He asked me to come to him.	Gara isaa akkan dhufu na gaafate.
I still couldn’t answer	Ammallee deebii kennuu hin dandeenye
It won't be any other way.	Karaa biraa hin ta'u.
It has both of those things.	Wantoota sana lamaan qaba.
That time, things didn’t go my way.	Yeroo sana, wanti akka kootti hin deemne.
He should have said something sooner	Silaa dafee waan tokko dubbachuu qaba ture
I have no desire to ever do that again	Kana booda gonkumaa akkas gochuuf fedhii hin qabu
I hope it helps you	Akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba
It shouldn't be here.	Asitti ta'uu hin qabu.
But that’s not a bad thing.	Garuu sun waan hamaa miti.
Big deal, you know.	Dhimma guddaa, beekta.
I like it that simple.	Akkas salphaa ta'ee natti tola.
I can see the real me	Ana isa dhugaa arguu nan danda'a
I could make her mine	Kan koo ishee gochuu nan danda'a ture
I'm not sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti.
I think this is my biggest mistake	Kun dogoggora koo isa guddaa natti fakkaata
With his school.	Mana barumsaa isaa waliin.
But I will do it.	Ani garuu nan godha.
I need say no more.	Kana caalaa hin jechuun na barbaachisa.
It might be better than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
Then it gets bad.	Sana booda hamaa ta'a.
He wanted to help.	Gargaaruu barbaade.
I had no idea what I wanted him to know	Waan inni beekuu akkan barbaadu yaada hin qabu ture
I wish that was the case today	Har'a akkas ta'ee natti tola
It is a very good room.	Kutaa baayyee gaarii dha.
He says their two names.	Maqaa isaanii lamaan jedha.
Whatever happens, it happens.	Maaltu ta'a, ni ta'a.
But you shouldn't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin qabdu.
But not so different perhaps.	Garuu akkas adda miti tarii.
He should have been here.	Silaa as jiraachuu qaba ture.
He has a bad feeling	Miira hamaa qaba
I didn’t think it was important	Barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
But without him.	Garuu isa malee.
I love you very, very much.	Baay'ee baay'een si jaalladha.
This wasn’t going so well.	Kun hangas gaarii hin deemu ture.
Just wanted to know if you had any ideas	Yaada qabaachuu kee qofa beekuu barbaade
Not sure about that.	Sana irratti mirkanaa'aa miti.
He had the car.	Konkolaataa sana qaba ture.
But it only does one thing.	Garuu waan tokko qofa hojjeta.
I'll walk through it.	Ani keessa nan deema.
There is no reason for it.	Sababni qabu hin jiru.
I am very, very happy	Baay'ee baay'een gammadeera
New.	Haaraa.
I was in it.	Ani keessa ture.
Everything, in this case, being me.	Wanti hundi, haala kana keessatti, ana ta'uu.
Now it's my business.	Amma dhimma koo.
They come, they go.	Isaan dhufu, ni deemu.
But it is not like that at all.	Garuu tasumaa akkas miti.
Now he had something to do.	Amma waan hojjetu qaba ture.
That was kind of a good thing.	Sun akka waan gaarii ture.
No one could tell me what to do.	Namni maal akkan godhu natti himuu hin dandeenye.
I have a couple of these	Isaan kana keessaa lama lama qaba
he thought to himself	jedhee yaade
It happened today.	Har'a ta'e.
I used to love him a lot.	Duraan baay'een isa jaalladha ture.
No recent past.	Yeroo dhiyootti kan darbe hin jiru.
It's my own.	Ofii kooti.
He should have stayed home then	Silaa yeroo sana mana turuu qaba ture
Now we are making it clear.	Amma ifa gochaa jirra.
He’s not really interested in me.	Inni dhuguma naaf fedhii hin qabu.
He does his job.	Hojii isaa hojjeta.
A new day.	Guyyaa haaraa.
But I can't tell him that	Ani garuu akkas itti himuu hin danda'u
He looked at her in the daylight	Ifa guyyaa keessa ishee ilaale
I love this moment with him	Yeroo kana isa waliin jiru baay'een jaalladha
I didn't know what it was about him	Waa'ee isaa maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I knew something was wrong about me.	Waa'ee koo wanti dogoggora ta'e akka jiru nan beeka ture.
I knew what he was doing	Waan inni hojjetu nan beeka ture
You can't tell what it is.	Maal akka ta'e beekuu hin dandeessu.
This was excellent.	Kun baayyee gaarii ture.
Nothing much happened.	Wanti baay'ee ta'e hin jiru.
This would be excessive.	Kun garmalee ta'a.
They will be.	Ni ta'u.
I can't imagine being anywhere else	Bakka biraa ta'uu yaadu hin danda'u
I knew he knew me, but I couldn’t speak	Akka na beeku nan beeka ture, garuu dubbachuu hin dandeenye
A car that works often	Konkolaataa yeroo baayyee hojjetu
That is,.	Sun ...dha,.
He didn't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himne.
It was a little bit.	Xiqqoo ture.
Sorry about that.	Waa'ee kanaa dhiifama.
You should have seen her.	Silaa ishee arguu qabda turte.
You are more emotional than he is.	Ati isa caalaa miira qabda.
I thought you had two	Lamaan qabdu natti fakkaate
I know you’re right	Sirrii akka taate nan beeka
Everything was his.	Wanti hundi kan isaa ture.
I thought about it.	Anis itti yaade.
They were there to help me.	Isaan na gargaaruuf achi turan.
But, that’s life.	Garuu, sun jireenya.
We have little of any of them at the moment.	Yeroo ammaa kana isaan keessaa tokkollee xiqqoo qabna.
That’s just too good.	Sun garmalee gaarii qofa.
I want to ask you something	Waan tokko isin irraa gaafachuu barbaada
But there would be.	Garuu ni jiraata ture.
I just thought you needed to know about this one	Waa'ee isa kanaa beekuu qabdu qofa jedheen yaade
For this reason.	Yaada kanaaf.
I thought it was good	Gaarii natti fakkaate
The problem is with him.	Rakkoon jiru isa bira jira.
I looked around a bit	Xiqqoo naannoo koo ilaale
She was never there.	Isheen gonkumaa achi hin turre.
They are the only ones	Isaan kana qofa
I know all about it.	Waa'ee kanaa hunda nan beeka.
I wouldn’t have wanted her to	Silaa akka isheen gootu hin barbaadu ture
I was really excited about this one	Isa kanaaf baay'een gammade
He was here when it happened	Yeroo ta'u as ture
It may have nothing to do with him	Isa waliin homaa hin qabu ta'a
I couldn’t find anything else	Waan biraa argachuu hin dandeenye
It was then.	Yeroo sana ture.
I wasn’t going to do it though.	Ani garuu gochuuf hin turre.
I think this is going to be a great book.	Kun kitaaba guddaa ta'uuf deema jedheen yaada.
That's not a very good home environment.	Sun naannoo manaa baayyee gaarii miti.
She really needs to do something.	Dhuguma waan tokko gochuu qabdi.
Have a bad day.	Guyyaa hamaa ta'aa.
It had to be me.	Ana ta'uu qaba ture.
I love him more than anything in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti waan hundumaa caalaa isa jaalladha
I have everything in here	Waan hundumaa as keessa qaba
He looked at the moment.	Yeroo sana ilaale.
I wondered what I was going to do	Maal gochuuf deema jedheen yaade
He found a bit of humor in this.	Kana keessatti qoosaa xiqqoo argate.
I could have had it.	Ani qabaachuu nan danda'a ture.
They may not know you.	Si beekuu dhiisuu danda'u.
I was right, that was bad.	Ani sirrii ture, sun hamaa ture.
I’ve never said it before	Kanaan dura jedhee hin beeku
I think about that guy	Ani waa'ee gurbaa sanaa nan yaada
But people still do it.	Garuu namoonni ammallee ni hojjetu.
This shouldn't be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu.
He loves what he does.	Waan hojjetu ni jaallata.
Just hold on.	Qabaa qofa.
He didn’t know what to do	Maal akka godhu hin beeku ture
Nothing has a name.	Wanti maqaa qabu hin jiru.
So they think about it.	Kanaaf yaadu.
Still, people do work.	Ammas namoonni hojii hojjetu.
I couldn't go back	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
One thing is clear.	Wanti tokko ifaadha.
It was a small thing.	Waan xiqqoo ture.
That sounds pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
Which can be without.	Kan malee ta'uu danda'u.
It was a good life.	Jireenya gaarii ture.
But mostly that was it.	Garuu irra caalaa kanuma ture.
No one seems to be at home.	Namni mana jiru hin fakkaatu.
She didn’t know what to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu hin beektu turte.
I could come tonight but not now	Halkan kana dhufuu nan danda'a ture garuu amma miti
Most of the time it's not right.	Yeroo baayyee sirrii miti.
This is still a very good picture.	Kun ammallee suuraa baayyee gaarii dha.
I can't work with you anymore	Kana booda si waliin hojjechuu hin danda'u
Everyone wants something fresh and new.	Namni hundi waan haaraa fi haaraa barbaada.
Take a look at that.	Mee sana ilaalaa.
Most people do it	Namoonni baay'een ni hojjetu
That was what he was saying.	Wanti inni jedhu akkas ture.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I didn’t know there was another one	Kan biraa akka jiru hin beeku ture
But he obviously was.	Inni garuu akka ture ifaadha.
It wasn’t going well.	Akka gaariitti deemaa hin turre.
That is the function of the room.	Hojiin kutaa sanaa kanuma.
I can't say exactly when	Yoom akka ta'e sirriitti dubbachuu hin danda'u
It certainly wasn’t that bad.	Akkas hamaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I certainly don’t know.	Ani akkan hin beekne beekamaadha.
I wanted to ask him a few questions	Gaaffii muraasa isa gaafachuu barbaade
I want to see them.	Isaan arguu barbaada.
They are the parents.	Isaan warra.
Some little time.	Yeroo xiqqoo tokko tokko.
He could still do it.	Ammas ni danda'a ture.
I can tell you're in the mood	Miira keessa akka jirtu sitti himuu nan danda'a
I enjoyed it very much	Baayʼee itti gammadeera
Many, many years now.	Waggaa hedduu, hedduu amma.
We met there.	Achitti wal argine.
Obviously you can’t.	Akka hin dandeenye ifaadha.
A lot can happen in a year	Waggaa tokko keessatti waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a
With good reason, but still.	Sababa gaarii qaba, garuu ammas.
That’s not them.	Sun isaan miti.
I know what we can be	Maal ta'uu akka dandeenyu nan beeka
I have a lot of ideas.	Yaada baay'een qaba.
All that matters is how you can help.	Wanti barbaachisaa taʼe, akkamitti gargaaruu akka dandeessu qofa.
They may be right.	Isaan sirrii taʼuu dandaʼu.
She doesn't have anything good.	Isheen waan gaarii hin qabdu.
I don't seem to be able to.	Ani waanan danda'u hin fakkaatu.
Again he got what he wanted.	Ammas waan barbaade argate.
I just love you so much	Baay'ee si jaalladha qofa
It’s not unique.	Adda miti.
I couldn’t find it anymore.	Kana booda argachuu hin dandeenye.
The reason for this is unclear.	Sababni kanaa ifa miti.
He’s a good dog, really.	Inni saree gaarii dha, dhuguma.
I'm not waiting anymore.	Kana booda eegaa hin jiru.
I love your mother, you know that	Haadha kee nan jaalladha, ati kana beekta
She had to do it.	Isheen gochuu qabdi turte.
I’m glad I got it	Ani argachuu kootti gammadeera
I think in the morning.	Ganama jedheen yaada.
I know he still has it	Ammallee akka qabu nan beeka
He said it wasn't.	Akkas miti jedhe.
Like that was the only reason.	Akkuma sababni sun qofa ture.
I didn't need much	Baay'ee na hin barbaachifne
I have no idea what’s out there	Waan ala jiru yaada hin qabu
In every single room.	Kutaa tokko hunda keessatti.
Now they had none.	Amma tokkollee hin qaban turan.
It took him a year.	Waggaa tokko itti fudhate.
It may be right.	Sirrii ta’uu danda’a.
Sorry, I can't.	Dhiifama, hin danda'u.
Should have done this hours ago.	Silaa sa'aatii dura kana gochuu qaba ture.
Obviously, things didn't happen.	Wanti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Tomorrow will be the best day of your life.	Boru guyyaa jireenya kee keessaa isa gaarii ta'a.
They all need to know.	Hundi isaanii beekuu qabu.
But we don't.	Nuti garuu hin goonu.
It may or may not work.	Hojjechuu danda'a ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
They come from life	Jireenya irraa dhufu
I just didn't know where	Eessa akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
I knew he didn’t want a reputation like that	Maqaa gaarii akkasitti akka hin barbaanne nan beeka ture
It requires commitment	Of kennuu barbaada
I had no idea she was going to do that	Isheen akkas gochuuf akka jirtu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It would be necessary.	Silaa barbaachisaa ta'a.
Try it for a while!.	Yeroo muraasaaf yaalaa!.
I don’t like them.	Ani isaan hin jaalladhu.
Still not a big deal.	Ammas waan guddaa miti.
But now look at what they have.	Amma garuu waan isaan qaban ilaalaa.
I couldn’t always have my way.	Yeroo hundumaa karaa koo qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
That’s what makes you.	Kan si godhu kanuma.
Every night, sometimes even daylight.	Halkan hunda, yeroo tokko tokko ifa guyyaa illee.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu homaa hin qabu.
I know there’s another one coming	Kan biraa akka dhufu nan beeka
Like, really good.	Akka, dhuguma gaarii dha.
I really did, many times	Dhuguma nan godhe, yeroo baay'ee
Now I know who he is	Amma eenyu akka ta'e nan beeka
I can never get back with him.	Yoomiyyuu isa waliin deebi'uu hin danda'u.
I know he wants to see you both	Lamaan keessan arguu akka barbaadu nan beeka
I saw her not too long ago	Yeroo dheeraa dura miti ishee arge
I told him I couldn't believe you were doing this.	Kana gochaa jirta jedhee amanuu hin danda'u jedhee itti hime.
I haven’t met him in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isa waliin wal hin argine
If you do, you can come back.	Yoo akkas goote deebi'uu dandeessa.
I can ask questions	Gaaffii gaafachuu nan danda'a
She will be such a good girl from now on	Amma booda intala gaarii akkasii ta'a
I didn't speak to him	Ani itti hin dubbanne
It wasn’t there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti hin turre.
I don’t need any help	Gargaarsa tokkollee na hin barbaachisu
But he knew better.	Inni garuu caalaatti beeka ture.
That's what I came up with.	Kanaan dhufe.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
But there’s no reason they can’t do both.	Garuu sababni isaan lamaan gochuu hin dandeenye hin jiru.
You were right about it.	Waa'ee isaa sirrii turte.
Not sure of that	Sana mirkanaa'aa miti
Sometimes you just didn’t know how to do it.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkamitti akka gootu qofa hin beektu turte.
I wasn’t alone for long	Ani kophaa koo yeroo dheeraa hin turre
It really was out of place	Dhuguma bakka hin qabu ture
This was for a while.	Kun yeroo muraasaaf ture.
He wanted to ask for answers.	Deebii gaafachuu barbaade.
Important we more than that.	Barbaachisaa nuti kana caalaa.
Last time I couldn’t	Yeroo darbe hin dandeenye
Completely different scenario.	Guutummaatti haala adda ta'e.
I just didn't quite know when	Yoom akka ta'e qofa sirriitti hin beeku ture
But this was only his opinion.	Kun garuu yaada isaa qofa ture.
He was probably right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu hin oolu.
I know why you are here	Maaliif akka as jirtu nan beeka
I can't leave it here	Asitti dhiisuu hin danda'u
We don’t need it.	Nu hin barbaachisu.
Now I have to ask you two something	Amma waan tokko isin lamaan gaafachuu qaba
I'm not even sure there's one answer.	Deebii tokko akka jiru illee mirkanaa'aa miti.
With that he saw where he was going.	Kanaan eessa akka deemu arge.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
I wasn’t looking for any money	Maallaqa tokkollee barbaadaa hin turre
Those were not in place.	Isaan sun bakka isaanii hin turre.
I didn't want him.	Isa hin barbaanne.
It wouldn't happen later down the road.	Booda karaa irratti hin ta'u ture.
But he seemed to have none.	Garuu waan hin qabne fakkaata ture.
Every part of you.	Kutaa kee hunda.
I thought you were someone else.	Ati nama biraa natti fakkaate.
No one should tell him where he is.	Namni eessa akka jiru itti himuu hin qabu.
I would have liked to have had it a little longer	Silaa xiqqoo dheeraa qabaachuu nan barbaada ture
Now, it’s not entirely clear what this means.	Amma, kun maal jechuu akka ta’e guutummaatti ifa miti.
She was never going to forgive me for anything.	Isheen gonkumaa homaa naaf dhiifama gochuuf hin turre.
You can't back away from her.	Ishee irraa duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
It couldn't have happened.	Silaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
You have a lot going on.	Waan baay'ee deemaa jiru qabda.
He looked at her for a moment	Yeroo muraasaaf ishee ilaale
A chance to do well again	Carraa ammas waan gaarii hojjechuuf
I didn’t belong	Ani kan ofii hin turre
All those people were fine at the time.	Namoonni sun hundi yeroo sanatti gaarii turan.
That’s not my job.	Sun hojii koo miti.
It shouldn’t be like that.	Akkasitti jiraachuu hin qabu.
We were in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa turre.
But we only had one car.	Garuu konkolaataa tokko qofa qabna turre.
There is nothing here.	Wanti as hin jiru.
It’s not just a picture.	Suuraa qofa miti.
Everything he said was true.	Wanti inni jedhe hundi dhugaa ture.
He can't be a father.	Abbaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
He would have had it.	Silaa qaba ture.
He asked me what he could do for me.	Maal naaf gochuu danda'a jedhee na gaafate.
I need their help.	Gargaarsa isaanii na barbaachisa.
As it was.	Akkuma ture.
Hope is good.	Abdiin gaarii dha.
Time has three parts.	Yeroon kutaa sadii qaba.
I didn’t understand why he wanted me	Maaliif akka na barbaadu naaf hin galle
I really hope it does	Dhuguma akka ta'u abdiin qaba
Then I'll go.	Sana booda nan deema.
I might just be able to do this	Ani kana gochuu qofa danda'a ta'a
He says it was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture jedha.
Very large.	Baayyee guddaa.
He had time.	Yeroo qaba ture.
It took a little bit.	Xiqqoo fudhate.
It’s really obvious.	Dhuguma ifaadha.
I was waiting, too	Anis eegaa ture
You can go somewhere new.	Bakka haaraa deemuu dandeessa.
Now I could believe this.	Amma kana amanuu nan danda'a ture.
They were no different.	Isaan adda hin turre.
He says he hasn't seen any of that money yet.	Maallaqa sana keessaa tokkollee hanga ammaatti hin argine jedha.
I didn't know what it could be, at the time.	Maal ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku ture, yeroo sanatti.
It was his mistake.	Dogoggora isaa ture.
No one else should have known.	Silaa namni biraa beekuu hin qabu ture.
I own it and it looks great	Ani kan qaba fi baayyee gaarii fakkaata
She’s not that much, you should know that.	Isheen hanga kanaa miti, kana beekuu qabda.
She was one of many children	Ijoollee hedduu keessaa tokko turte
I could live anywhere	Bakka barbaade jiraachuu nan danda'a ture
I didn’t have a car anymore	Kana booda konkolaataa hin qabu ture
I don't know what to do	Waan godhu hin beeku
I didn’t intend to do this	Kana gochuuf hin yaadne
On, on, on.	Irratti, irratti, irratti.
It is in the late period.	Yeroo booda keessa jira.
I can't get a job.	Hojii argachuu hin danda'u.
Maybe there's a reason for that.	Tarii sababni sanaa jira ta'a.
He asked me the same question again.	Ammas gaaffii sana na gaafate.
It was not an easy time.	Yeroon sun yeroo salphaa hin turre.
Now it was no longer a question.	Amma kana booda gaaffii hin turre.
This was better.	Kun wayya ture.
I can't even do it.	Ani illee hin danda'u.
I love that sort of thing	Waan akkasii nan jaalladha
I can't go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
But you can get back on track.	Garuu karaa irra deebi'uu dandeessa.
But it's me.	Garuu ana.
I can still see a lot of them	Ammallee baay'ee isaanii arguu nan danda'a
I want to be in it.	Ani keessa jiraachuu barbaada.
I have more than enough space at my house	Mana kootti bakka gahaa ol qaba
So everyone was happy.	Kanaaf namni hundi gammade.
I think they are great	Isaan guddaa natti fakkaata
I don't have to stay here	Ani as turuu hin qabu
I thought there was some hope.	Abdiin tokko tokko jira jedheen yaade.
I couldn’t see the tall man.	Nama dheeraa sana arguu hin dandeenye.
I didn't know what would happen	Maal akka ta'u hin beeku ture
Today you are somewhere, tomorrow you are somewhere else.	Har'a bakka tokko jirta, boru bakka biraa jirta.
I have him for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa qaba.
Not much at all.	Tasumaa baay'ee miti.
Check it out with mine and she never has time.	Isa koo waliin ilaalaa isheen gonkumaa yeroo hin qabdu.
I didn't realize how big it was	Hamma isaa guddaa ta'uu isaa hin hubanne
Again, we agreed.	Ammas walii galle.
I had no real friends	Hiriyyoota dhugaa hin qabu ture
He already knows he will do that	Akkas akka godhu duruu beeka
I knew he was on his way	Karaa irra akka jiru nan beeka ture
But really, he is.	Garuu dhuguma, inni.
That problem is different from the one before us.	Rakkoon sun isa nu dura jiru irraa adda.
I thought you wanted to see it	Arguu barbaaddu natti fakkaate
He was trying to help	Gargaaruuf yaalaa ture
We’re in a very different situation today.	Har’a haala baay’ee adda ta’e keessa jirra.
I didn't want to be a good person	Ani nama gaarii ta'uu hin barbaanne ture
I didn’t have time to think about it	Yeroon itti yaadu hin qabu ture
He wants the best for us tonight	Halkan kana waan gaarii nuuf barbaada
I haven’t known her for very long	Baayyee yeroo dheeraaf ishee hin beekne
Go with them.	Isaan waliin deemaa.
The only thing that is real is this moment, right now.	Wanti dhugaa ta'e yeroo kana qofa, yeroo ammaa kana.
Anyone have any suggestions?.	Namni yaada qabu jiraa?.
I had to admit, it looked pretty good	Ani amanuu qaba ture, baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture
Some people do that to you.	Namoonni tokko tokko akkas si godhu.
Therefore, as	Kanaaf, akka .
She had things to do.	Wantoota hojjechuu qabdu qabdi turte.
Something very special.	Waan baayyee adda ta'e.
I couldn't have done it without you.	Osoo kee malee gochuu hin danda'u ture.
It’s the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii dha.
That's right.	Sirrii dha.
I knew who he was.	Eenyu akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
I was very excited	Ani baay'een gammade
I hope that helps.	Sun akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I'll know when soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti yoom beeka.
I didn't know it was you	Si ta'uu hin beeku ture
I just couldn’t believe it	Ani qofa amanuu hin dandeenye
This should help.	Kun gargaaruu qaba.
I couldn’t eat anything	Homaa nyaachuu hin dandeenye
I should have found you	Silaa si argachuu qaba ture
It’s not all that simple.	Kun hundi akkas salphaa miti.
I’m still myself.	Ammallee ofii kooti.
It took two hours.	Sa'aatii lama fudhate.
We spoke our interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii keenya dubbanne.
Someone who didn’t go	Nama hin deemne
I really want a pair of shoes.	Kophee tokko baay'een barbaada.
It wants to be clear.	Ifa ta'uu barbaada.
Not much of an idea.	Yaada baay'ee miti.
He wasn't sure but he thought he made a mistake.	Inni mirkanaa'aa hin turre garuu dogoggora hojjete itti fakkaate.
I wouldn't be too sure	Silaa garmalee mirkanaa'aa hin ta'u ture
I knew you loved him	Akka ati isa jaallattu nan beeka ture
I just didn’t know anyone else who came up here	Namni biraa as ol dhufe qofa hin beeku ture
He even thought maybe he was right	Tarii sirrii ta'uu danda'a jedhee illee yaade
I wondered why that was.	Maaliif akkas taʼe jedheen yaade.
But mostly he has something else to do.	Garuu irra caalaa waan biraa hojjechuu qaba.
But you are there.	Ati garuu jirta.
Even if you hadn't done asking.	Osoo gaafachuu hin goone ta'ee illee.
I just have it.	Ani qofa qaba.
Even my hands.	Harka koo illee.
You are very different here.	Asitti baayyee adda taate.
But we didn't.	Nuti garuu hin taane.
I think you are in danger	Balaa keessa waan jirtu natti fakkaata
He was not in any danger.	Balaa tokkollee keessa hin turre.
Not much, you know.	Baay'ee miti beekta.
I can help you with that	Sana irratti si gargaaruu nan danda'a
I don't know anymore.	Sana booda hin beeku.
I know almost everyone.	Nama hunda nan beeka jechuun ni danda'ama.
That was her.	Sun ishee turte.
It was not an easy year.	Bara salphaa hin turre.
He wanted to know the truth	Dhugaa jiru beekuu barbaade
I had to have it.	Ani qabaachuu qaba ture.
I looked up at her.	Ol jedheen ishee ilaale.
But it is not like that at all.	Garuu tasumaa akkas miti.
I can't believe what you have here	Waan ati asitti qabdu amanuu hin danda'u
It really doesn’t matter.	Dhuguma homaa hin qabu.
I knew where she was going	Eessa akka deemtu nan beeka ture
Maybe in coming and going, once.	Tarii dhufuu fi deemuu keessatti, yeroo tokko.
For a moment I had no idea what to say	Yeroo muraasaaf maal akkan jedhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
But not more than that.	Kana caalaa garuu miti.
This seemed like a good opportunity.	Kun carraa gaarii fakkaata ture.
Which no longer exists.	Kan kana booda hin jirre.
I just wouldn’t need one	Silaa tokko qofa na hin barbaachisu ture
Which wasn’t entirely true.	Kan guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre.
I haven’t seen you in a few weeks	Torban muraasaaf si hin argine
To some extent, I think that’s fair	Hamma tokko akkas jechuun sirrii natti fakkaata
No one seemed to notice.	Namni waan hubate hin fakkaatu ture.
Today.	Har'a.
I think that’s a good thing	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaata
He couldn't do jokes	Qoosaa hojjechuu hin danda'u ture
It’s just his real voice.	Sagalee isaa isa dhugaa qofa.
I really wanted to know why	Maaliif akka ta'e baay'een barbaada ture
I wanted to get to know you	Si beekuu barbaade
You have to do a good morning.	Ganama gaarii hojjechuu qabda.
It just seems right.	Sirrii qofa fakkaata.
It had pictures and everything.	Suuraa fi waan hunda qaba ture.
But there is a problem.	Garuu rakkoon jira.
I think one of us should stay there	Tokko keenya achi turuu qaba jedheen yaada
He just wanted to do it tonight	Halkan kana isa qofa hojjechuu barbaade
I wonder how things will go then	Yeroo sanatti wanti akkamitti deemu jedheen yaada
No one knew what to say.	Namni maal akka jedhu hin beeku ture.
I had hardly seen anyone.	Nama tokkollee baay'ee hin argine ture.
No one wants it.	Namni barbaadu hin jiru.
It was really quite nice.	Dhuguma baayyee namatti tola ture.
I know what you care about me.	Waan ati naaf yaaddu nan beeka.
This is not one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko miti.
I didn’t tell him everything.	Waan hundumaa itti hin himne.
It doesn’t need to be exact.	Sirrii ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
I saw nothing but him	Isa malee waan biraa hin argine
I don't know if this is a good idea or not.	Kun yaada gaarii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
No one knows everything.	Namni waan hunda beeku hin jiru.
He must admit this	Kana amanuu qaba
It has more than enough work	Hojii gahaa ol qaba
Maybe this, maybe that.	Tarii kana, tarii akkas ta'a.
With my wife.	Haadha manaa koo waliin.
I can't be with anyone	Nama waliin ta'uu hin danda'u
I doubt you have other ideas	Yaada biraa akka qabdu nan shakka
I was already so into him	Ani duruu akkasitti isa keessa ture
It may be right.	Sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
What do I think.	Maal jedheen yaada.
I can't help it	Gargaaruu hin danda'u
It has more than you think	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa qaba
I didn’t know anything else	Waan biraa hin beeku ture
I think you should go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabdu jedheen yaada.
It was going well.	Akka gaariitti deemaa ture.
No one thought of it.	Namni yaade hin jiru.
I’m just one guy.	Ani gurbaa tokko qofa.
Look into the facts.	Dhugaa jiru keessa ilaalaa.
I’m not like that anymore	Ani kana booda akkas miti
They say I just can't do it now.	Amma qofa hin danda'u jedhu.
But it wasn’t enough.	Garuu gahaa hin turre.
Just look at you guys.	Isin qofa ilaalaa.
It was something else.	Waan biraa ture.
But he had something.	Garuu waan tokko qaba ture.
He knows exactly where he is	Eessa akka jiru sirriitti beeka
Your money, maybe, but not mine.	Maallaqa kee, tarii, garuu kan koo miti.
He said he just had to see.	Arguu qofa qaba jedhe.
You know what it’s like in the morning here.	Asitti ganama maal akka fakkaatu beekta.
He was in it.	Inni keessa ture.
I want them here in the hour	Sa'aatii keessatti as isaan barbaada
I just said it will happen.	Ani qofa jedheen ni ta'a.
I didn't know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture.
Perhaps you do not have it.	Tarii hin qabdu taʼa.
It was just certain	Mirkanaa'aa qofa ture
I was glad that wasn’t the case.	Akkas akka hin taane nan gammade.
You're not there.	Ati hin jirtu.
You can make that happen.	Akkas akka ta'u gochuu dandeessa.
I have a problem with them	Isaan waliin rakkoon qaba
I didn’t want to play anymore	Kana booda taphachuu hin barbaanne
You can never know your dog.	Saree kee gonkumaa beekuu hin dandeessu.
Then he never did that again.	Sana booda kana booda gonkumaa akkas hin goone.
That sort of thing doesn't happen often in real life.	Wanti akkasii yeroo baay'ee jireenya dhugaa keessatti hin ta'u.
She couldn’t see herself.	Ofii ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
I know you want her	Ishee akka barbaaddu nan beeka
I’m just saying I have one.	Tokko qaba jechuu koo qofa.
Something had to give, he had.	Waan tokko kennuu qaba ture, ni qaba ture.
Very good idea	Yaada baayyee gaarii
People are not willing to help me.	Namoonni na gargaaruuf fedhii hin qaban.
He got a car.	Konkolaataa argate.
So I couldn't ask you.	Eegaa si gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
I just need a little time	Yeroo xiqqoo qofa na barbaachisa
I didn’t mean that	Ani akkas jechuu hin barbaanne
I wonder if he’s alone	Kophaa isaa jiraa jedheen yaada
She was going, but didn’t really want to go.	Isheen deemaa turte, garuu dhuguma deemuu hin barbaanne.
But it was.	Garuu ni ture.
I wondered how long it had been	Yeroon isaa meeqa jedheen yaade
He was a pretty big guy.	Inni gurbaa baay'ee guddaa ture.
I was just glad I got something	Waan tokko argachuu kootti qofa gammade
I just didn’t want him to do it.	Ani akka inni godhu qofa hin barbaanne.
It was just a little bit today.	Har'a xiqqoo qofa ture.
I know you know this	Kana akka beektu nan beeka
I wouldn’t have thought about it.	Silaa itti hin yaadu ture.
He couldn’t, of course.	Hin dandeenye, beekamaadha.
I mean something completely different	Waan guutummaatti adda ta'e jechuu kooti
I just hadn’t thought of it before	Kana dura hin yaadne qofa ture
There is just no forgiveness for this.	Kanaaf dhiifama gochuun hin jiru qofa.
I didn’t really see that one coming.	Dhuguma isa sana dhufuu hin argine.
I just can't see it.	Ani qofa arguu hin danda'u.
This week was no better.	Torban kun kana caalaa hin turre.
I could do this all day.	Guyyaa guutuu kana gochuu nan dandaʼa ture.
There's not much you can do in that situation.	Haala sana keessatti waan baay'ee hojjechuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I didn’t realize this involved that	Kun akkas akka of keessaa qabu hin hubanne
I knew what he could do.	Maal gochuu akka dandaʼu nan beeka ture.
We still need a house.	Ammas mana nu barbaachisa.
I'm looking for it.	Ani nan barbaada.
I think everyone was excited.	Namni hundi waan gammade natti fakkaata.
One of them is your father.	Isaan keessaa tokko abbaa kee.
I can do a lot of things	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu nan danda'a
We needed help.	Gargaarsa nu barbaachisa ture.
This was one of those nights.	Kun halkan sana keessaa tokko ture.
It doesn’t seem so bad.	Akkas hamaa hin fakkaatu.
He is none of these.	Inni kana keessaa tokkollee miti.
A year has passed.	Waggaa tokko darbe.
I didn’t really think of it that way	Dhuguma akkasitti hin yaadne
As they seem to go.	Akkuma deemu fakkaatu.
I was just playing around	Ani taphachuu qofa ture
It’s in good hands.	Harka gaarii keessa jira.
He must be fully aware of everything that is going on	Waan deemaa jiru hunda guutummaatti beekuu qaba
I couldn't see what it was	Maal akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye
This works very well.	Kun baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I think it’s money.	Maallaqa natti fakkaata.
Look around you.	Naannoo keessan ilaalaa.
It's going to be you.	Si ta'uuf deema.
A good life, you might say.	Jireenya gaarii jechuu dandeessu.
I, I don’t want to do that.	Ani, akkas gochuu hin barbaadu.
I couldn’t give it mine	Kan koo itti kennuu hin dandeenye
Maybe that's why?.	Tarii kanaaf ta'uu danda'a?.
But they do of course.	Garuu ni godhu beekamaadha.
It has everything you need.	Waan isin barbaachisu hunda qaba.
I love your work so much	Hojii kee baay'een jaalladha
I wonder what is that about me.	Waa'ee koo maaltu akkas ta'a jedheen yaada.
I want you in my mouth.	Afaan koo keessa si barbaada.
This, he knew, would be the worst part.	Kun, kutaa hunda caalaa hamaa akka ta'u beeka ture.
He shouldn’t have been here.	Silaa as jiraachuu hin qabu ture.
He wouldn't have.	Silaa hin qabu ture.
I think you know everything.	Waan hundumaa waan beektu natti fakkaata.
He hasn't spoken yet	Ammallee hin dubbanne
Sometimes it works, I thought.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta jedheen yaade.
It involves a return.	Deebi'uu of keessaa qaba.
I didn’t want to ask before	Kanaan dura gaafachuu hin barbaanne
It would have been a good morning	Silaa ganama gaarii ta'a ture
And I was just there.	Anis achi qofa ture.
None of them are good reasons.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee sababa gaarii miti.
I haven't seen you two together much	Lamaan keessan baay'ee waliin hin argine
But it’s still no one else’s business.	Garuu ammas dhimma nama biraa miti.
Maybe you have it.	Tarii qabaachuu dandeessa.
I just love you so much	Ani baay'een si jaalladha qofa
There would be nothing.	Silaa wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
We are good at that.	Sana irratti ga'umsa qabna.
That’s how it’s going to work.	Akkasitti hojjechuuf deema.
I can't leave that out	Sana dhiisuu hin danda'u
Everything went very well.	Wanti hundi baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme.
Before that, you need to know about it.	Kana dura waaʼee isaa beekuu qabda.
I didn’t know anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin beeku ture.
Then he thought about the bigger picture.	Sana booda waa'ee suuraa guddaa sana yaade.
I couldn’t do anything for him	Homaa isaaf gochuu hin dandeenye
Always was, probably always will be.	Yeroo hundumaa ture, tarii yeroo hundumaa ni ta'a.
I want someone to tell me what to do.	Namni maal akkan godhu akka natti himu nan barbaada.
It was terrible.	Hamaa ture.
I didn’t know what she knew	Waan isheen beektu hin beeku ture
I didn’t want to give that impression	Yaada sana kennuu hin barbaanne
Clearly, that was no longer true.	Kana booda sun dhugaa akka hin turre ifaadha.
Only if you knew.	Osoo beektu qofa.
One more night.	Halkan tokko kan biraa.
Not sure about this one.	Isa kanaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
How many of them did not speak.	Meeqa keessaa hin dubbanne.
Neither of us wanted to leave each other at the time.	Yeroo sanatti lamaan keenyayyuu wal dhiisuu hin barbaanne.
It was just what it was.	Maal qofa ture.
I like danger, but I’m not a bad guy.	Balaa nan jaalladha malee gurbaa hamaa miti.
But someone has to speak up.	Garuu namni tokko dubbachuu qaba.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
He has something to say.	Waan jedhu qaba.
The problem was time.	Rakkoon yeroo ture.
That has never happened before.	Kana dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
I made it work for him.	Akka itti hojjetu nan godhe.
I can do it again.	Ammas gochuu nan danda'a.
It’s no different than me.	Ana irraa adda hin qabu.
Everything you want.	Waan barbaaddu hunda.
I won’t do that to him	Ani akkas isa hin godhu
I can't give you his medical stuff	Waan yaalaa isaa siif kennuu hin danda'u
It can't be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I don't want anything else.	Kan biraa hin barbaadu.
It wasn’t her car.	Konkolaataa ishee hin turre.
I'll go somewhere else	Bakka biraa nan deema
It looked really good.	Dhuguma gaarii fakkaata ture.
You are with them in good times and bad.	Yeroo gaarii fi hamaa keessa isaan waliin jirta.
I didn’t mean that	Ani akkas jechuu koo hin turre
But she could see nothing.	Isheen garuu homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
This seems simple.	Kun salphaa fakkaata.
I didn’t know anyone was out there	Namni tokkollee akka ala jiru hin beeku ture
I already knew she wasn’t going with anyone	Nama waliin akka hin deemne duraan beeka ture
I wonder what he meant	Maal dubbachuu barbaade jedheen yaada
He was the only person there.	Nama achi jiru isa qofa ture.
He is not at home.	Inni mana hin jiru.
No one really saw this coming.	Dhuguma namni kun dhufuu isaa arge hin jiru.
She let her do it for you.	Isheen akka siif gootu goote.
But it wasn’t true.	Garuu dhugaa hin turre.
It was his house.	Mana isaa ture.
She, however.	Isheen garuu.
But that would be wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora ta'a.
I love working with you	Si waliin hojjechuu baay'een jaalladha
He should have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu qaba ture
I couldn’t believe they weren’t there	Isaan akka hin jirre amanuu hin dandeenye
I need it before tomorrow morning	Boru ganama dura na barbaachisa
I couldn’t believe he even had to ask that question	Gaaffii sana gaafachuu illee akka qabu amanuu hin dandeenye
We don't have time.	Yeroo hin qabnu.
That’s just great.	Sun waan guddaa qofa.
These people may never be.	Namoonni kun gonkumaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼu.
If it ever does, certainly not again.	Yoom iyyuu yoo ta'e, kana booda akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I still can't see anyone about	Ammallee waa'ee nama tokkollee arguu hin danda'u
Maybe none of them	Tarii isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru ta'a
I'll be fine with him.	Isa waliin gaarii ta'a.
This night was a great time.	Halkan kun yeroo guddaa ture.
But that certainly never happened.	Garuu akkas ta’ee akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
He loves you.	Si inni jaallata.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
I don't think of her	Ani ishee hin yaadu
He was doing a good job	Hojii gaarii hojjechaa ture
But now she	Amma garuu isheen .
I can't stay in this house with him	Mana kana keessa isa waliin turuu hin danda'u
That may be irrational.	Sun yaada kan hin qabne taʼuu dandaʼa.
Only two hours.	Sa'aatii lama qofa.
He didn’t quite look like mine.	Inni guutummaatti kan koo hin fakkaatu ture.
It goes there.	Achitti deema.
I thought it would be funny.	Qoosaa ta'a jedheen yaade.
Very nice indeed!.	Baayyee namatti tola dhuguma!.
I need help, you know that	Gargaarsa na barbaachisa, kana beekta
I am alone and alone	Ani kophaa koo fi kophaa kooti
It's happening right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana ta'aa jira.
But he was lucky.	Garuu carraa qaba ture.
I have no idea what that is.	Sun maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I can even rarely go without this stuff	Waan kana malee yeroo muraasaaf illee deemuu nan danda'a
You must come with me.	Ana waliin dhufuu qabda.
I would never say anything like that	Ani gonkumaa waan akkasii hin jedhu ture
It happens every hour, every day.	Sa'aatii hunda, guyyaa hunda ni ta'a.
They knew they could never go home.	Yoomiyyuu gara manaatti deebi'uu akka hin dandeenye ni beeku turan.
I wanted to stay with you	Si bira turuu barbaade
I wouldn’t do anything	Ani homaa hin godhu ture
We are still here.	Ammas as jirra.
So a few of them.	Kanaaf isaan keessaa muraasa.
Wait and see.	Eegaa ilaalaa.
I saw him only moments later	Yeroo muraasa qofa booda isa arge
I didn’t just want to say you were right	Sirrii jette jechuu qofa hin barbaanne
No one has come around to tell you what to do.	Namni maal akka gootu sitti himu naannoo dhufe hin jiru.
Why is this happening.	Kun maaliif ta'aa jira.
He wants her so badly.	Akka malee ishee barbaada.
If someone cares, I want to	Namni tokko yoo dhimma itti ba'e nan barbaada
But he has his return.	Garuu deebi'uu isaa qaba.
He is still doing so	Hanga ammaatti akkas gochaa jira
It was his life.	Jireenya isaa ture.
I don't think it will happen.	Ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadu.
I’m not into this stuff.	Ani waan kana keessa hin jiru.
He didn’t do anything here	Asitti homaa hin hojjenne
Not much there.	Achitti baay'ee miti.
But he stayed there all week.	Inni garuu torban guutuu achi ture.
I just want to know what's going on in there	Waan achi keessa ta'aa jiru qofa beekuu barbaada
I could say a lot more than that	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu nan danda'a ture
I was in time for this issue.	Dhimma kana yeroon ture.
You must have some questions for me.	Gaaffii tokko tokko naaf qabaachuu qabdu.
I really don't think it's very good.	Dhuguma baayyee gaarii natti hin fakkaatu.
But I don't know how to say it.	Akkamitti akkan jedhu garuu hin beeku.
I don't mean ours.	Keenya jechuu koo miti.
They are our light.	Isaan ifa keenya.
But this is not entirely correct.	Garuu kun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
Now, look at my hands.	Amma, harka koo ilaalaa.
I really think so	Dhuguma akkas jedheen yaada
It's just a question.	Gaaffii qofa.
It was something we could do	Waan dandeenyu ture
I know almost nothing about her	Waa'ee ishee homaa hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama
I used to do that on his hands	Duraan harka isaa irratti akkas nan godha ture
Now, it’s no longer in question.	Amma, kana booda gaaffii keessa hin jiru.
I have something to tell you	Waan sitti himu qaba
I didn’t want to work.	Hojii hojjechuu hin barbaanne.
I didn’t want any commitment	Waadaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
This was worse than anything before.	Kun waan kanaan dura ture hunda caalaa hamaa ture.
There wasn't much time.	Yeroon baay'ee hin turre.
A real dog.	Saree dhugaa.
You don't know.	Hin beektu.
Maybe it's us.	Tarii nu ta'uu danda'a.
I couldn’t do this.	Kana hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
Going over everything.	Waan hundumaa irra deemuu.
I think about this	Kana irratti nan yaada
I wasn’t there, anymore	Ani achi hin turre, kana booda
He had nothing to say about it.	Waa'ee kanaa waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
It’s in you.	Si keessa jira.
I didn’t want to believe any of it.	Isa keessaa tokkollee amanuu hin barbaanne.
I want to know these things	Wantoota kana beekuu barbaada
But that’s okay.	Garuu sun homaa miti.
She’s not looking at me.	Isheen na ilaalaa hin jirtu.
We don’t have it.	Nuti hin qabnu.
He tried again.	Ammas yaale.
There was nothing to help them here.	Asitti wanti isaan gargaaru hin turre.
He is still doing it.	Ammas gochaa jira.
I know he will do it	Akka inni godhu nan beeka
Otherwise I like it.	Yoo kana hin taane natti tola.
He’s just another bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa biraa qofa.
You know one thing.	Tokko ni beekta.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
I just didn't want to be alone	Kophaa ta'uu qofa hin barbaanne
He said that you are.	Akka ati jirtu jedhe.
I know it was an accident	Balaa akka ture nan beeka
He needs time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaadu barbaada.
They help each other.	Wal gargaaru.
There was no one on the road.	Karaa irra namni hin turre.
It's really how things are.	Dhuguma wanti jiru akkamitti akka ta'e.
Everyone in the place knew what had happened.	Bakka sana jiru hundi waan ta'e ni beeka ture.
Tell them the situation.	Haala jiru itti himi.
But something was really wrong.	Garuu dhuguma wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
I didn't mean it of course	Ani jechuu koo hin turre beekamaadha
I have a couple of questions.	Gaaffii tokko lama qaba.
This can be a mistake.	Kun dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼa.
He is doing well in life	Jireenya keessatti haala gaarii irra jira
I know he's trying now	Amma akka yaalaa jiru nan beeka
I couldn't have done it alone	Silaa kophaa koo gochuu hin danda'u ture
But we need that voice.	Garuu sagalee sana nu barbaachisa.
At the time I didn't even know he was different.	Yeroo sanatti inni adda ta'uu isaa illee hin beeku ture.
Time didn’t do it.	Yeroon hin goone.
I say sorry.	Dhiifama jedha.
I care about it.	Ani itti dhimma qaba.
It was complete.	Guutuu ture.
I just didn’t have the time.	Yeroo hin qabu ture qofa.
A couple of hours maybe	Sa'aatii lama lama tarii
I should probably do that.	Ani tarii akkas gochuu qaba.
Just like in the old days.	Akkuma bara durii.
I know you don’t see it	Akka hin argine nan beeka
He sought him, but could not find him	Isa barbaade, garuu isa argachuu hin dandeenye
I can't see into the past	Waan darbe keessa arguu hin danda'u
I would never tell him the truth	Dhugaa jiru gonkumaa itti hin himu ture
I think that's the girl	Intala sana natti fakkaata
I didn't want to talk about it, even.	Ani waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne, illee.
Her old room.	Kutaa ishee durii.
I say go for it.	Anis itti deemaa jedha.
People love it.	Namoonni ni jaallatu.
I'm here to stay.	Ani as jira.
I can only give so much	Hanga sana qofa kennuu danda'a
I still do it.	Ammallee nan godha.
But it never happened.	Garuu ta'ee hin beeku.
That certainly isn't here.	Sun mirkanaa'aa as hin jiru.
It will never be without him	Yoomiyyuu isa malee hin ta'u
I hardly knew anyone	Nama tokkollee baayʼee hin beeku ture
I know you know the truth	Dhugaa akka beektu nan beeka
It worked for me.	Naaf hojjete.
It was there.	Achi ture.
I can't believe it's happening right now	Yeroo ammaa kana ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I had none of that anymore	Kana booda sana keessaa tokkollee hin qabu ture
I can tell you it was some work	Hojii tokko tokko akka ture sitti himuu nan danda'a
I don't think so	Akkas natti hin fakkaatu
It was a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ture.
It had all happened.	Hundi isaa ta'ee ture.
It had been a while.	Yeroo muraasa ta'ee ture.
She was doing the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechaa turte.
So you like it.	Kanaaf sitti tola.
I didn't think that was going to happen	Akkas waan ta'uuf deemu natti hin fakkaatu ture
Now you know what to do.	Amma maal akka gootu beekta.
I haven’t seen them in a few weeks	Torban muraasa booda isaan hin argine
I love people.	Namoota nan jaalladha.
Just like your parents.	Akkuma warra kee.
But he got a life.	Garuu jireenya argate.
Sometimes not always.	Yeroo tokko tokko yeroo hunda miti.
Then of course he wasn't.	Sana booda akka hin turre beekamaadha.
He got an idea.	Yaada tokko argate.
I can't have too many.	Baay'ee qabaachuu hin danda'u.
I won't do anything to you	Ani homaa si hin godhu
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
I couldn’t walk anymore	Kana booda deemuu hin dandeenye
Most people don't care.	Namoonni baay'een dhimma hin qaban.
I'm happy to be myself.	Of ta'uu isaatiin gammadeera.
I recognize that voice	Sagalee sana nan beeka
I have a very, very good feeling about tonight	Waa'ee halkan kanaa miira baayyee baayyee gaarii qaba
She just didn’t seem to have it.	Ishee qofa waan hin qabne fakkaata ture.
He knows where he wants to be.	Bakka ta'uu barbaadu ni beeka.
He wanted them so badly	Akka malee isaan barbaade
It would have been nice.	Silaa gaarii ta'a.
I didn’t want to do that to him	Ani akkas isa gochuu hin barbaanne
I have nothing to tell you	Waan sitti himu hin qabu
Not that one.	Isa sana miti.
There are many of us now.	Amma baay'ee jirra.
I didn’t know what she looked like	Maal akka fakkaattu hin beeku ture
She had to say it.	Jechuu qabdi turte.
It just has to be me	Ana ta'uu qofa qaba
But I won't say more	Kana caalaa garuu hin jedhu
There is one reason.	Sababni tokko.
I knew he wanted to ask me	Na gaafachuu akka barbaadu nan beeka ture
That didn't tell me much.	Sun waan baay'ee natti hin himne.
I know this never happens in reality.	Kun dhugaa jiru keessatti gonkumaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
You don’t know what it was then.	Yeroo sana maal akka ture hin beektu.
I thought it was just him, you know	Isa qofa jedheen yaade, beekta
No one seemed to do just one thing.	Namni waan tokko qofa hojjetu hin fakkaatu ture.
They all loved him.	Hundi isaanii isa jaallatu turan.
I don't say anything to her about it	Waa'ee kanaa homaa ishee hin jedhu
I wonder what she was doing	Maal hojjechaa turte jedheen yaada
I don't know what else could be wrong.	Kan biraa maaltu dogoggora ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
But it wasn’t true, of course.	Garuu dhugaa hin turre, beekamaadha.
I wanted to be like them	Anis akka isaanii ta'uu barbaade
I didn't think so	Akkasitti hin yaadne
That’s why it was.	Kanaaf ture.
In one room.	Kutaa tokko keessatti.
It really didn’t matter.	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabu ture.
I never said that.	Akkas jedhee hin beeku.
Look at this one.	Isa kana ilaalaa.
So we have plenty of time.	Kanaaf yeroo baay'ee qabna.
She was his wife.	Isheen haadha manaa isaa turte.
I know this other part	Kutaa biraa kana nan beeka
Like a bright day.	Akka guyyaa ifa.
I hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
Usually this doesn't happen.	Yeroo baayyee kun hin ta'u.
I can't say enough good things	Waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
I really have to go	Dhuguma deemuun qaba
So everything works.	Kanaaf wanti hundi ni hojjeta.
I would never do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture
This does not mean that they are not dangerous.	Kana jechuun balaa hin qaban jechuu miti.
Just like with cars.	Akkuma konkolaataa waliin.
I didn't know what it meant.	Maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I never wanted to stay here	Asitti turuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
Now, sometimes you may have times when you can’t do that.	Amma, yeroo tokko tokko yeroo akkas gochuu hin dandeenye qabaachuu dandeessa.
The fact that she needs to see him again.	Ammas isa arguu akka qabdu dhugaa jiru.
I can be out doing something	Ani waan tokko hojjechaa ala ta'uu nan danda'a
I just didn't know how	Akkamitti akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
I am willing to go with this idea	Yaada kanaan deemuuf fedhii qaba
That couldn't happen.	Sun ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I love the new name	Maqaa haaraa kana baay'een jaalladha
Not on my watch.	Sa'aatii koo irratti miti.
I knew he wouldn’t be here long	Yeroo dheeraa akka as hin turre nan beeka ture
I can't tell you what's good and what's bad	Waan gaarii fi waan hamaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
It's doing well.	Gaarii hojjechaa jira.
I went through a lot	Waan baay'ee keessa darbe
He has a house here.	Asitti mana qaba.
We have to do that.	Sana gochuu qabna.
They were the only ones we had.	Isaan qofa nu bira turre.
And on the	Ani kan .
I have no interest in you	Ani fedhii tokkollee siif hin qabu
It's never about me.	Waa'ee koo gonkumaa miti.
I would never have thought of that	Silaa gonkumaa akkas hin yaadu ture
It was definitely a long day.	Guyyaa dheeraa akka ture beekamaadha.
Everything about her, really.	Waa'ee ishee waan hundumaa, dhuguma.
Someone is watching them.	Namni isaan ilaalaa jira.
I don't really know if it's right or not.	Sirrii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa sirriitti hin beeku.
But you have to have a new name.	Garuu maqaa haaraa qabaachuu qabda.
Maybe too long.	Tarii garmalee dheeraa ta'uu danda'a.
I'm not going to be that person	Ani nama sana hin ta'u
I hope that is of some help	Sun gargaarsa tokko tokko akka ta'u abdiin qaba
Of course, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You obviously can’t do that.	Kana gochuu akka hin dandeenye ifaadha.
I have issues with them	Ani dhimma isaan irratti qaba
I can't give you anything	Ani homaa siif kennuu hin danda'u
I think he's a good man.	Nama gaarii natti fakkaata.
I'm just a human being	Ani nama qofa
Not all of you are enough.	Hundi keessan gahaa miti.
It should have what you need	Waan isin barbaachisu qabaachuu qaba
It was a mistake, a disaster.	Dogoggora, balaa ture.
But he didn't speak.	Garuu hin dubbanne.
A lot of work is still needed.	Ammas hojiin baay'een barbaachisa.
But none currently exist.	Garuu yeroo ammaa kana tokkollee hin jiru.
That comic book I’m working on all the time.	Kitaaba qoosaa yeroo hunda irratti hojjechaa jiru sana.
But we did it.	Garuu hojjenne.
If everyone sees it.	Yoo namni hundi arge.
But it’s not money.	Garuu qarshii miti.
I still didn’t know	Ammallee hin beeku ture
I'm saying that.	Ani akkas jedha.
He already knew who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e duruu beeka ture
How much should they tell him.	Meeqa itti himuu qabu.
I can't live anymore	Kana booda jiraachuu hin danda'u
I might have an idea who did this	Eenyu akka kana godhe yaada qabaachuu danda'a
I did, and I will again.	Anis nan godhe, ammas nan godha.
They look like a good mother.	Waan gaarii haadha fakkaatu.
That doesn’t mean he does.	Kana jechuun ni godha jechuu miti.
That said, we didn’t.	Kana jechuun, nuti hin taane.
I was none of those things	Ani wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin turre
We need it.	Nu barbaachisa.
One of them, by itself, is not enough.	Isaan keessaa tokko, ofuma isaatiin, gahaa miti.
That’s a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii dha.
But you are there now.	Ati garuu amma achi jirta.
And yet, not ever.	Ammas ta'ee gonkumaa miti.
We need to find you two there.	Achitti isin lamaan argachuu qabna.
I don’t want to find them.	Isaan argachuu hin barbaadu.
And I just thought it was a good thing	Anis waan gaarii natti fakkaate qofa
That was not much to say.	Akkas jechuun baayʼee hin turre.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun haala akkasii miti.
I look exactly like my mom	Ani sirriitti haadha koo fakkaata
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
He saw my hand.	Harka koo arge.
It will always be yours.	Yeroo hundumaa kan kee ta'a.
That's what he said.	Kana jedhe.
I know this was the right guy	Kun gurbaa sirrii akka ture nan beeka
It's been a little while	Yeroo xiqqoo ta'ee jira
I didn’t quite know what to do	Maal akkan godhu sirriitti hin beeku ture
Now, it’s different.	Amma, adda.
That was good enough.	Sun gaarii ture.
Often this is possible, but not always.	Yeroo baayyee kun ni danda'ama, garuu yeroo hunda miti.
A lot of money	Maallaqa guddaa
That is the current situation.	Haala amma jiru kanuma.
I really can't answer right now.	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kana deebii kennuu hin danda'u.
I don’t know the true extent and I probably never will	Hamma dhugaa hin beeku tarii gonkumaa hin beeku
They care about us.	Isaan nuuf yaadu.
Now you know how he got his nickname.	Maqaa maqaa ijoollee isaa akkamitti akka argate amma beekta.
Everything has a reason.	Wanti hundi sababa qaba.
It was a great idea.	Yaada guddaa ture.
I love that you want to do this	Kana gochuu akka barbaaddu nan jaalladha
You can do those things.	Wantoota sana hojjechuu dandeessa.
Probably the most important one.	Tarii isa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
I didn’t have that much money with me	Maallaqa hamma sanaa of biraa hin qabu ture
I mean, that’s okay	Sun homaa miti jechuu kooti
I think this is a mistake.	Kun dogoggora natti fakkaata.
But that’s my father.	Garuu sun abbaa kooti.
Everything was going to be fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'uuf ture.
But we didn’t have that kind of time.	Yeroo akkasii garuu hin qabnu turre.
But obviously not.	Garuu akka hin taane ifaadha.
I just didn't know where that could be	Sun eessa ta'uu akka danda'u qofa hin beeku ture
Not my whole self.	Ofii koo guutuu miti.
She obviously wants to live here.	As jiraachuu akka barbaaddu ifaadha.
That means it's for you.	Kana jechuun siif ta'a.
That wasn’t the case then	Yeroo sana akkas hin turre
It was something new in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti waan haaraa naaf ture.
I didn't understand anything	Homaa hin hubanne
I could see the part then	Yeroo sanatti kutaa sana arguu nan dandaʼa ture
We are here now.	Amma as jirra.
He knew something was wrong	Waan tokko akka dogoggora ta'e beeka ture
It was during the day.	Guyyaa ture.
I can find some time	Yeroo muraasa argachuu nan danda'a
They stayed in the room for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf kutaa sana keessa turan.
I couldn’t stay much longer.	Kana caalaa yeroo dheeraa turuu hin dandeenye.
Nothing happens for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf wanti ta'u hin jiru.
Where she is.	Bakka isheen jirtu.
They shouldn’t get it.	Argachuu hin qaban.
So, we did it.	Kanaaf, ni goone.
There is no time this morning.	Ganama kana yeroon hin jiru.
I want you to want to be with me	Na waliin ta'uu akka barbaaddu nan barbaada
I couldn’t see anything.	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
Not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti.
He had to be with them.	Isaan waliin ta'uu qaba ture.
I can't tell you, yet	Sitti himuu hin danda'u, ammallee
I'll have you soon	Yeroo dhiyootti si qaba
They don't seem to have any others.	Kan biraa waan qaban hin fakkaatu.
Then, like everyone else, I couldn’t play this morning.	Sana booda akkuma nama hundumaa ganama kana taphachuu hin dandeenye.
Really love them.	Dhuguma isaan jaalladhu.
Most people just want a good answer.	Namoonni baay'een deebii gaarii argachuu qofa barbaadu.
I think that's the most important thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma natti fakkaata.
I think a lot of people were	Namoonni baay'een akka turan natti fakkaata
But it certainly was something like that.	Garuu waan akkasii akka ture beekamaadha.
That was really something.	Sun dhuguma waan tokko ture.
It was something inside something else.	Waan biraa keessa waan tokko ture.
I don't know much about anything.	Waa'ee homaa baay'ee hin beeku.
I didn’t see a reason not to.	Sababni akka hin taane hin argine.
It will be great there.	Achitti guddaa ta'a.
We can't get much food.	Nyaata baay'ee argachuu hin dandeenyu.
She said there wasn't.	Hin jiru jette.
It can only be one thing.	Waan tokko qofa ta'uu danda'a.
But then, not necessarily.	Garuu sana booda, dirqama miti.
Perhaps even hopeful.	Tarii abdii illee qabaachuu dandaʼa.
I need more of this in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti kana caalaa na barbaachisa.
He didn’t quite do the job.	Hojii sana guutummaatti hin hojjenne.
I could do things that no one else could do.	Wantoota namni biraa gochuu hin dandeenye hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture.
They certainly never do.	Isaan kana gonkumaa akka hin goone beekamaadha.
All that work was waiting for me.	Hojiin sun hundi na eegaa ture.
We have no obligation.	Dirqama hin qabnu.
I was outside but inside.	Ani ala ture garuu keessa ture.
It was a hand she knew well.	Harka isheen sirriitti beektu ture.
There was no need to do this right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana gochuun hin barbaachisu ture.
I do this all the time.	Kana yeroo hunda nan godha.
You thought you knew me until then.	Hanga sanatti waan na beektu sitti fakkaate.
I need time.	Yeroon barbaada.
It worked well for me.	Akka gaariitti naaf hojjete.
You don't know anything.	Ati homaa hin beektu.
Someone was here.	Namni tokko as ture.
I knew then that you didn’t mean it	Ati jechuu akka hin taane yeroo sana beeka ture
Almost a lot.	Gara baay'ee.
Someone was definitely in the house.	Namni tokko mana sana keessa akka ture beekamaadha.
I couldn’t do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I didn't realize it was you	Si ta'uu hin hubanne
He knows about you.	Waa'ee kee ni beeka.
I thought that was pretty cool	Sun baayyee namatti tola jedheen yaade
You know you will.	Akka gootu beekta.
I want to know what is going on	Waan deemaa jiru beekuu barbaada
But this was different.	Kun garuu adda ture.
I didn't even know who he was	Eenyu akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture
Didn't see her much.	Baay'ee ishee hin argine.
I couldn’t tell him what to do	Waan godhu itti himuu hin dandeenye
I won't tell you anything about the truth.	Waa'ee dhugaa jiru homaa sitti hin himu.
I didn't want to believe it	Anis amanuu hin barbaanne
I was good at my job	Hojii koo irratti gaarii ture
She shouldn't be here, in this room.	Isheen as ta'uu hin qabdu, kutaa kana keessa.
I wanted to be myself, find myself and live myself	Of ta'uu, of argachuu fi of jiraachuu barbaade
I can't do that to you again	Ammas akkas si gochuu hin danda'u
I couldn’t tell anyone the truth	Dhugaa jiru namatti himuu hin dandeenye
I still have no idea why this happens.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u ammallee yaada hin qabu.
I can't leave her like that	Akkasitti ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u
It should be going now.	Amma deemaa jiraachuu qaba.
I wasn’t late.	Ani yeroon booda hin turre.
Everyone there had it.	Namni achi jiru hundi qaba ture.
She's still not herself at all, you know.	Ammallee ofii ishee tasumaa hin jirtu beekta.
I don't mean for any of this to happen	Kana keessaa tokkollee akka ta'u jechuu koo miti
I couldn’t help her.	Ishee gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
He was certainly there.	Inni achi akka ture beekamaadha.
He knew she had an idea.	Yaada akka qabdu beeka ture.
One problem, though.	Rakkoon tokko garuu.
But he really has to go	Dhuguma garuu deemuu qaba
She was alone, he knew that much.	Isheen kophaa ishee turte, inni hanga sana beeka ture.
It was just completely wrong for us.	Guutummaatti nuuf dogoggora qofa ture.
He's looking at you	Si ilaalaa jira
I saw that a lot so far today.	Har'a hanga ammaatti sana baay'ee arge.
He spoke to it.	Itti dubbate.
Clearly, this was not the case.	Kun akkas akka hin turre ifaadha.
You are the most important person in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti nama hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taate.
He spoke the truth.	Dhugaa dubbate.
I didn't tell him exactly	Ani sirriitti itti hin himne
No one thought anything of me leaving now.	Amma deemuu koo namni homaa yaade hin jiru.
You never know much.	Waan baay'ee gonkumaa hin beektu.
I think he’s not really human	Dhuguma nama miti jedheen yaada
I am good to go.	Ani deemuuf gaarii dha.
I can't help you.	Si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I don’t like them anymore	Kana booda isaan hin jaalladhu
I could have it for you in a week	Torban tokko booda siif qabaachuu nan danda'a ture
I knew this wasn’t going to go well.	Kun akka gaariitti akka hin deemne nan beeka ture.
No clothes, nothing.	Uffata hin qabu, homaa hin qabu.
He didn’t seem happy.	Inni waan gammade hin fakkaatu ture.
I didn't realize he had a lot	Baay'ee akka qabu hin hubanne
Maybe, maybe not.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a, tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
He lives here.	Inni as jiraata.
A place where we can live	Bakka itti jiraachuu dandeenyu
I want you to know this	Kana akka beektu nan barbaada
I wondered what our language would think	Afaan keenya maal yaada jedheen yaade
I didn’t want to be with anyone else	Nama biraa bira jiraachuu hin barbaanne
He still had much to do.	Ammas waan baayʼee hojjechuu qabu ture.
You were right about that.	Waa'ee kanaa sirrii turte.
From just up there.	Achi ol qofa irraa.
I could never tell him the truth	Dhugaa jiru gonkumaa itti himuu hin dandeenye
Everything gave way to his duty.	Wanti hundi dirqama isaaf bakka kenne.
That's why she said it.	Kanaaf jette.
I know a lot of people feel bad because of this.	Sababa kanaan namoonni baay'een miira hamaa akka qaban nan beeka.
This isn’t all bad.	Kun hundi hamaa miti.
This can be a lot of things.	Kun waan baay’ee ta’uu danda’a.
This will be important to us later.	Kun booda barbaachisaa nuuf ta'a.
I don't need much.	Waan baay'ee na hin barbaachisu.
I thought there was really something going on	Dhuguma waan tokko ni jira jedheen yaade
He was that great.	Inni hangas guddaa ture.
Unless we don't want to.	Yoo akka nuti hin barbaanne malee.
We need to help them	Isaan gargaaruu qabna
I just can't leave her	Ishee dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u
I love that about her	Waa'ee ishee sana nan jaalladha
That’s what she needs to do.	Kan isheen gochuu qabdi kanuma.
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
He was in good hands with her	Ishee waliin harka gaarii qaba ture
Not until now.	Hanga ammaatti miti.
I'm that girl.	Ani intala sana.
Sometimes now, at night.	Yeroo tokko tokko amma, halkan.
He had a question.	Gaaffii qaba ture.
It is already clear.	Duraan ifaadha.
I didn’t want you in this but now you are	Kana keessatti si hin barbaanne amma garuu jirta
One of them says nothing.	Isaan keessaa tokko homaa hin jedhu.
I highly doubt whether it will happen now	Amma ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa baay'een shakka
He wants to go home.	Inni gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaada.
Until recently.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti.
Probably my favorite thing ever.	Tarii waan ani yoomiyyuu jaalladhu ta'uu danda'a.
So that doesn’t work for you.	Kanaaf sun siif hin hojjetu.
No one is joking.	Namni qoosaa jiru hin jiru.
I wish it was different	Osoo adda ta'ee natti tola
I didn't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I loved when he was there	Yeroo inni achi ture baayʼee natti tola ture
I know you need to see her.	Ishee arguu akka qabdu nan beeka.
I thought you were my wife	Ati haadha manaa koo natti fakkaate
Not on me, but on the clothes.	Ana irratti osoo hin taane, uffata irratti.
That's what she said.	Akkas jettee turte.
He was walking a lot.	Baay'ee deemaa ture.
She wouldn't have done it.	Silaa hin gootu turte.
He knows where he’s going.	Eessa akka deemu ni beeka.
I was one of those people	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko ture
I hadn’t expected to stay long.	Yeroo dheeraa turuuf jedhee hin yaadne ture.
He has a desire.	Fedhii qaba.
But I knew better than that	Ani garuu kana caalaa beeka ture
Which, for the most part, they do.	Kan, irra caalaa, isaan hojjetu.
I just didn’t know how to do it	Akkamitti akkan godhu qofa hin beeku ture
I came across this a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura kanaan wal arge.
I had better not go any further.	Kana caalaa deemuu dhiisuu naaf wayya ture.
I used to think it was a complete disaster	Duraan balaa guutuu natti fakkaata ture
She has many names.	Maqaa hedduu qabdi.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
I think you’ll love it	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
Another new one.	Kan biraa haaraa.
I think we should have more children	Ijoollee baay'ee qabaachuu qabna jedheen yaada
He was just a little man.	Inni nama xiqqoo qofa ture.
Savage.	Hamaa.
What little she is	Waan xiqqoo isheen taate
I know my duty.	Dirqama koo nan beeka.
Sometimes I can't believe you	Yeroo tokko tokko si amanuu hin danda'u
I know it doesn’t mean that	Akkas jechuu akka hin taane nan beeka
He cares a lot about me.	Inni baayʼee naaf yaada.
You didn't want to be him.	Ati isa ta'uu hin barbaanne.
I mean, they can.	Ni danda'u jechuu kooti.
People want to know.	Namoonni beekuu barbaadu.
But his getting a job.	Garuu hojii argachuu isaa.
That's all for us today.	Har'a nuuf kana qofa.
You don’t have to do all of this.	Kana hunda gochuun dirqama miti.
Everyone is different here.	Asitti namni hundi adda adda.
He is looking at her.	Inni ishee ilaalaa jira.
They all knew it.	Hundi isaanii ni beeku turan.
But they needed more.	Garuu kana caalaa isaan barbaachisa ture.
I wanted to believe you so much	Baay'een si amanuu barbaade
This one is the most obvious.	Inni kun hunda caalaa ifaadha.
He must have time.	Yeroo qabaachuu qaba.
We wanted to go, you know.	Deemu barbaanne, beekta.
He can play it.	Taphachuu danda'a.
Only three months.	Ji'a sadii qofa.
I want everything, you know? 	Ani waan hundumaa barbaada, beektaa?
he says	jedha
People who couldn’t live.	Namoota jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
It’s not their job.	Hojii isaanii miti.
I wouldn’t have thought about it	Silaa itti hin yaadu ture
The people he loves.	Namoota inni jaallatu.
And she did it again.	Ammas goote.
That’s just one little thing.	Sun waan xiqqoo tokko qofa.
This is much more accurate.	Kun baay’ee caalaatti sirrii dha.
I wondered where he was now.	Amma eessa jira jedheen yaade.
I think about you often.	Yeroo baay'ee waa'ee kee nan yaada.
No one is doing it.	Namni tokkollee hin hojjetu.
It wasn't about anything like that.	Waa'ee waan akkasii hin turre.
I'm not too sure.	Ani baay'ee mirkanaa'aa miti.
Just like my mother.	Akkuma haadha kooti.
I don’t have it.	Hin qabu.
She seems to be doing just fine.	Isheen waan gaarii hojjechaa jirtu fakkaata.
If that were the case.	Osoo akkas ta'ee.
One of them can even see anything.	Isaan keessaa tokko waan tokko illee arguu dandaʼa.
We’ll be in it soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti keessa jirra.
I don't think you know him.	Ati isa beektu natti hin fakkaatu.
I can't believe no one helps	Namni tokkollee hin gargaaru jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I have a feeling it may not happen now	Miira amma ta'uu dhiisuu danda'u qaba
I like the light here.	Ifa as jiru natti tola.
I know He loves you	Inni akka si jaallatu nan beeka
He thought about it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf itti yaade.
He shouldn't have been like that.	Inni akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I couldn't go today.	Har'a deemuu hin dandeenye.
That was too late, of course.	Sun yeroon booda akka ture beekamaadha.
But it still doesn’t seem to be working.	Garuu ammallee waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
I can't go back just yet.	Amma qofa duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
That’s how he made money.	Akkasitti maallaqa argate.
I wish that were the case.	Osoo akkas ta'ee natti tola.
Good day's work.	Hojii guyyaa gaarii.
I might have a problem	Rakkoo qabaachuu nan danda'a
I think I wouldn't be human without it	Osoo hin taane nama hin ta'u jedheen yaada
It had been their way for a long time.	Karaa isaanii yeroo dheeraa ture.
She said why she was here.	Maaliif akka as turte jette.
I loved playing.	Taphachuu nan jaalladha ture.
I was alone in my room	Kutaa koo keessa kophaa koo ture
I’m not just saying that.	Ani akkas jechuu qofa miti.
Still, they're not bad.	Ammas ta'ee isaan hamaa miti.
It seemed fine at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan gaarii fakkaata ture.
He was a bit the other way.	Inni xiqqoo karaa biraa ture.
I thought it was true at the time	Yeroo sanatti dhugaa natti fakkaate
He always knew just what to say.	Yeroo hundumaa waan jedhu qofa beeka ture.
But sometimes I can't.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko hin danda'u.
I know what he means.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade nan beeka.
But, that wasn’t the worst part.	Garuu, sun waan hunda caalaa hamaa hin turre.
There is no one else here.	Asitti namni biraa hin jiru.
So this is happening.	Kanaaf kun ta'aa jira.
I knew he wasn’t waiting for me	Na eegaa akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
That would be us.	Sun nu ta'a ture.
In this case the.	Haala kana keessatti kan.
They were then and they are now.	Yeroo sana turan ammas jiru.
It’s dangerous.	Balaa qaba.
Now it’s different.	Amma adda.
It’s not this thing.	Waan kana miti.
Name? 	Maqaa?
he says.	jedha.
You are my mother.	Ati haadha kooti.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
You don’t need to do anything more.	Kana caalaa waan tokko gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
He went through this time.	Yeroo kana keessa darbe.
I didn’t agree with my mother.	Haadha koo waliin walii hin galle.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Namatti himuu hin qabdu.
I think you know that	Kana waan beektu natti fakkaata
It seemed unimportant.	Wanti barbaachisaa hin taane fakkaata ture.
I didn’t tell with that.	Sana waliin hin himne.
She has nothing.	Isheen homaa hin qabdu.
I should have been here for him	Silaa isaaf as ta'uu qaba ture
I was doing you a favor	Tola siif gochaa ture
It was bright.	Ifa ture.
I had no idea about all this	Waa'ee kana hunda yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I didn't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I was pretty sure of myself	Ofitti baay'een mirkanaa'aa ture
This is just one of many	Kun hedduu keessaa tokko qofa
I just need a few good friends.	Hiriyyoota gaarii muraasa qofa na barbaachisa.
He has a good reputation	Maqaa gaarii qaba
I couldn’t make him do that	Akkas akka godhu gochuu hin dandeenye
No one knew, no one wanted to know.	Namni beeku hin turre, namni beekuu barbaadu hin turre.
I don't want to see you.	Si arguu hin barbaadu.
But you know the truth.	Dhugaa jiru garuu beekta.
They are all the same thing.	Hundi isaanii waan tokko.
That’s our era.	Sun bara keenya.
I love myself.	Of jaalladha.
This can't be true, I thought to myself.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u jedheen ofitti yaade.
I knew nothing about cars	Waa'ee konkolaataa homaa hin beeku ture
I was outside most of the night.	Halkan guutuu yeroo baayʼee ala ture.
He wanted it, he was there.	Inni barbaade, achi ture.
It must be really great	Dhuguma guddaa ta'uu qaba
He was theirs.	Inni kan isaanii ture.
Somewhere that is not here.	Bakka tokko kan as hin jirre.
We didn’t know what to do now.	Amma maal akka goonu hin beekne.
I am not a human being.	Ani nama miti.
It does both of those things.	Wantoota sana lamaan ni hojjeta.
No one else looks exactly like you.	Namni biraa sirriitti akka kee hin fakkaatu.
It was fresh, not so bad.	Haaraa ture, akkas hamaa hin turre.
In this case it was me.	Haala kana keessatti ana ture.
In this case they were right.	Haala kana keessatti sirrii turan.
I'm very interested.	Ani baay'een fedhii qaba.
I don't know why this happens.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u hin beeku.
It should have been more obvious	Silaa caalaatti ifa ta'uu qaba ture
I couldn't have been bad enough to do that	Ani akkas gochuuf hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture
They often do it.	Yeroo baayyee ni godhu.
But I’m not sure at all.	Garuu tasumaa mirkanaa’aa miti.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin turre.
I have a lot of money	Maallaqa baay'een qaba
I’m pretty sure this is correct	Kun sirrii ta’uu isaa mirkanaa’aa dha
He did as you said	Akkuma ati jette godhe
It really came to me	Dhuguma natti dhufe
I didn’t want to live anywhere else.	Bakka biraa jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
But that would be a bit much.	Garuu sun xiqqoo baay'ee ta'a.
All of you.	Hundi keessan.
Someone is looking for you.	Namni tokko si barbaadaa jira.
He was never good at these things	Wantoota kana irratti gonkumaa gaarii hin turre
I wasn't sure what it was, but it was true	Maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre, garuu dhugaa ture
But it’s there, no question.	Garuu achi jira, gaaffii hin qabu.
I started walking towards my room	Gara kutaa kootti deemuu jalqabe
I think that’s a bad thing	Sun waan hamaa natti fakkaata
She would never have wanted me to know that.	Silaa kana akkan beeku gonkumaa hin barbaaddu turte.
None of them are right	Isaan keessaa tokkollee sirrii miti
I only know a little bit	Ani xiqqoo qofa beeka
I think that’s really important	Sun dhuguma barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
I want him in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti isa barbaada
I think you have a handle	Qabduu waan qabdu natti fakkaata
That something needs to be done.	Waan tokko hojjechuu akka barbaachisu.
I want it so much, more than you know	Ani baay'een barbaada, waan ati beektu caalaa
I did, but not anymore	Anis nan godhe, garuu kana booda miti
Still very good.	Ammas baayyee gaarii dha.
I know you don’t understand	Akka siif hin galle nan beeka
I had no idea of ​​that at all	Ani tasumaa yaada sana hin qabu ture
He gave it to her.	Itti kenne.
It works very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
They are waiting for you.	Si eegaa jiru.
More about the.	Caalaatti waa'ee.
No one said it looked good.	Namni gaarii fakkaata jedhe hin jiru.
It's not her, though.	Ishee miti garuu.
I know this isn’t really the case	Kun dhuguma akka hin taane nan beeka
During the week.	Torban keessaa.
I could never live off that	Sana irraa gonkumaa jiraachuu hin dandeenye
Perhaps he saw them all along.	Tarii yeroo hundumaa isaan arge taʼa.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
A lot of people are watching.	Namoonni baay'een ilaalaa jiru.
I think that would be a good idea	Sun yaada gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
I still couldn’t believe my eyes	Ammallee ija koo amanuu hin dandeenye
It's not something that happens in real life.	Waan jireenya dhugaa keessatti ta'u miti.
This was not one of those times.	Yeroon kun yeroo sana keessaa tokko hin turre.
Then he said something else.	Sana booda waan biraa dubbate.
She didn’t know what she was.	Maal akka taate hin beektu turte.
Of course, this only happens to yourself.	Kun ofii kee qofa irratti akka ta’u beekamaadha.
I want to know why	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaada
I think we have a good handle on it	Qabduu gaarii irratti qabna jedheen yaada
I need to say she is	Isheen jechuun na barbaachisa
I knew it was.	Akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
Now it happened.	Amma ni ta'e.
But I knew everything	Ani garuu waan hundumaa beeka ture
I won't say it anymore.	Kana booda hin jedha.
', '.	', '.
She had no idea where she was.	Eessa akka jirtu yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
You know how it goes.	Akkamitti akka deemu beekta.
I like it now more than ever	Yoomiyyuu caalaa amma natti tola
I can certainly tell you	Sitti himuu akkan danda'u beekamaadha
I gave it to him.	Anis itti kenne.
I said you can't do it yourself	Ofii gochuu hin dandeessu jedheen
That was the worst.	Sun isa hamaa ture.
Probably not much.	Baay'ee ta'uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
I’ve known him for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa beeka.
Always.	Yeroo hundumaa.
Everything else looks fine.	Wanti biraa hundi gaarii fakkaata.
I never knew it could be so good	Akkas gaarii ta'uu akka danda'u gonkumaa hin beeku ture
Which happens a lot.	Kan baay'ee ta'u.
I really wanted to be a father	Abbaa ta'uu baay'een barbaada ture
I know you know him.	Isa akka beektu nan beeka.
I knew it was bad.	Hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
On that very large area	Naannoo baayyee guddaa ta'e sana irratti
I might have a few ideas	Yaada muraasa qabaachuu danda'a
You can see the issue here.	Dhimma kana as irraa arguu dandeessu.
I don't quite understand	Ani sirriitti naaf hin galle
They knew everything about everyone.	Waa'ee nama hundumaa waan hunda beeku turan.
I really don’t understand why it doesn’t work.	Dhuguma maaliif akka hin hojjenne naaf hin galle.
I thought that came out really well	Sun dhuguma gaarii ta'ee ba'e jedheen yaade
I wasn't looking at the clock	Sa'aatii ilaalaa hin turre
He wanted it so badly	Akka malee barbaade
I really want to know who it is	Eenyu akka ta'e baay'een beekuu barbaada
I know you’re on to something.	Waan tokko irra akka jirtu nan beeka.
Boy and girl.	Gurbaa fi intala.
I don't know anything	Ani homaa hin beeku
I had no idea how to go about it	Akkamitti akkan itti deemu yaada hin qabu ture
She is only three years old.	Umuriin ishee sadii qofa.
Better lucky than good.	Gaarii caalaa carraa qabaachuu wayya.
I didn’t want any of this part	Kutaa kana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
I didn't want to talk about it	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne
But not this time.	Yeroo kana garuu miti.
He was in such a mood	Miira akkasii keessa ture
She couldn’t leave herself	Ofii ishee dhiisuu hin dandeenye
He certainly knew differently.	Inni waan adda taʼe akka beeku beekamaadha.
He knew it was just a bad day.	Guyyaa hamaa qofa akka ta'e beeka ture.
She hadn’t been there.	Isheen hin turre turte.
Just like you said.	Akkuma ati jette.
I was wrong to say	Jechuun koo dogoggora ture
I didn’t think it was very important	Baayyee barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
It was as good as an apology.	Akkuma dhiifama gaafachuu gaarii ture.

No one else would have known this.	Silaa namni biraa kana hin beeku ture.
I think it would have worked	Silaa ni hojjeta jedheen yaada
Probably as good as you.	Tarii akkuma kee gaarii ta'a.
I just didn’t understand why she looked so different	Maaliif akkas adda akka fakkaattu qofa hin hubanne
I'm so glad you're here!.	Baay'een gammade as jirtu!.
It’s not a room.	Kutaa miti.
I think we have to tell the time	Yeroo himuu qabna jedheen yaada
She said come back here.	Asitti deebi'i jette.
He didn’t want anyone to know anything	Namni homaa akka beeku hin barbaanne
I couldn't have asked for more.	Silaa kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture.
I just didn’t know how to tell him	Akkamitti akkan itti himu qofa hin beeku ture
I didn’t like school	Mana barumsaa hin jaalladhu ture
It seems to be somewhat contained.	Hamma tokko kan of keessaa qabu fakkaata.
I tried it from time to time.	Yeroo yeroon yaale.
Such a very special person.	Nama baayyee adda ta'e akkasii.
One little girl, she was like that	Intala xiqqoo tokko, akkas turte
Was there anything more, he wondered. 	Kana caalaa wanti jiraa jedhee yaade.

There will be another time.	Yeroon biraa ni jiraata.

That was really nice.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola ture.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
I absolutely love everything about it	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa guutummaatti nan jaalladha
I think he started it	Inni waan jalqabe natti fakkaata
It still didn’t matter.	Ammallee dhimma hin qabu ture.
I can't go.	Deemu hin danda'u.
This time it took longer.	Yeroo kana yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
I want to be like him.	Anis akka isaa ta'uu barbaada.
I'm not sure what else will be revealed though	Kan biraa maaltu ifa akka ta'u garuu mirkanaa'aa miti
I think we’re on our way to doing that.	Sana gochuuf karaa irra jirra jedheen yaada.
I really couldn't have asked for more.	Dhuguma kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture.
We can't answer a lot of these things	Wantoota kana keessaa baay'ee deebii kennuu hin dandeenyu
This way it is doing very well.	Haala kanaan baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jira.
That's where it should be.	Bakka ta'uu qabu kanuma.
I knew about these things	Waa'ee wantoota kanaa nan beeka ture
After that it was much easier.	Sana booda baayyee salphaa ture.
He looked into his eyes again	Ammas ija isaa keessa ilaale
I know what’s in it	Waan keessa jiru nan beeka
There is no one.	Namni hin jiru.
He still wasn't quite sure how, but he knew it was.	Akkamitti akka ta'e ammallee sirriitti hin beeku ture, garuu akka ta'e beeka ture.
I need her help tomorrow.	Boru gargaarsa ishee barbaachisa.
I don't have a lot of clothes.	Uffata baay'ee hin qabu.
I think people are optimistic	Namoonni abdii guddaa qabu jedheen yaada
In the hour.	Sa'aatii keessatti.
Someone was outside.	Namni tokko ala ture.
I want to make one thing clear	Waan tokko ifa gochuu barbaada

But they are all the same .	Garuu hundi isaanii tokko .
That you need to do it and stay longer.	Akka ati gochuu qabduu fi yeroo dheeraa turuu akka qabdu.
It was nothing anymore.	Kana booda homaa hin turre.
But that’s wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora.
I really wanted a girl	Intala tokko baay'een barbaada ture
. . . .	.
It was good afterwards	Booda gaarii ture
I was just kidding you	Sitti qoosaa qofa ture
They’re really looking at that.	Dhuguma sana ilaalaa jiru.
I knew it really wasn’t	Dhuguma akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I don’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beeku.
Time means.	Yeroo jechuun.
That's how it happens most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee akkas ta'a.
But he couldn't stay.	Garuu turuu hin dandeenye.
It was the real one.	Kan dhugaa ture.
Just for a few hours.	Sa'aatii muraasaaf qofa.
This was the house.	Kun mana ture.
I think it's going to be an annual	Waggaa waggaa ta'uuf deema jedheen yaada
Not yet, but we hope.	Ammallee miti, garuu abdii qabna.
Nothing else works.	Wanti biraa hin hojjetu.
I mean, it's not right.	Sirrii miti jechuu kooti.
I really like this thing	Waan kana baay'een jaalladha
I need someone to tell me what to do	Nama maal akkan godhu natti himu na barbaachisa
I wasn't sure what she was expecting	Waan isheen eegaa akka jirtu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Many.	Hedduu.
I told him it was too soon	Dafee akka ta'e itti hime
I had no idea what to do with it.	Maal akkan itti godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
He is a man in his will.	Fedhii isaa keessatti nama dha.
He wouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas hin godhu ture.
He took the money.	Maallaqa sana fudhate.
I suspect that.	Akkas jedheen shakka.
I know you don’t want to see me like that.	Akkasitti na arguu akka hin barbaanne nan beeka.
It usually works.	Yeroo baayyee ni hojjeta.
We have a good afternoon.	Waaree booda gaarii qabna.
He was there when this happened	Yeroo kun ta'u achi ture
Maybe it's someone else.	Tarii nama biraa ta'uu danda'a.
I know you want what's best for me	Waan naaf ta'u akka barbaaddu nan beeka
I know absolutely nothing	Ani guutummaatti homaa hin beeku
Maybe it's the name.	Tarii maqaa ta'uu danda'a.
I have a good opinion about it	Waa'ee isaa yaada gaarii qaba
He wanted to be good.	Gaarii ta'uu barbaade.
I can do that too.	Anis sana gochuu nan dandaʼa.
But one had to be enough.	Garuu tokko gahaa ta'uu qaba ture.
What she can do that will probably help.	Wanti isheen sana gochuu dandeessu gargaaruu hin oolu.
He has it.	Isa qaba.
But he was so much more than that.	Inni garuu kana caalaa baayʼee ture.
It was only a matter of time before they found her.	Ishee argachuu isaanii dura dhimma yeroo qofa ture.
But he couldn't do it.	Garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
I don’t really know the problem.	Dhuguma rakkoo jiru hin beeku.
From nothing, comes nothing.	Homaa irraa, homaa hin dhufu.
It could be good!.	Gaarii ta'uu danda'a!.
I have friends with money	Hiriyyoota qarshii qaban qaba
Where everything and everything is in its place	Bakka waan hundumaa fi waan hundumaa bakka isaa jiru
She was there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi turte.
I have no idea what happened to her.	Maal akka ishee ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I told her what she did yesterday	Waan kaleessa goote itti hime
I don’t like it one bit	Xiqqoo tokkollee hin jaalladhu
Then I just couldn’t help myself	Sana booda of gargaaruu qofa hin dandeenye
I know this, I know.	Ani kana nan beeka.
That could have always been the case for us.	Yeroo hundumaa nuuf akkas taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
You can still do this right now.	Ammas yeroo ammaa kana gochuu dandeessa.
It was dangerous to do so.	Kana gochuun balaa qaba ture.
It's probably a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu hin oolu.
It should have been easy enough.	Silaa salphaa gahaa ta'uu qaba ture.
Tom was our father.	Toom abbaa keenya ture.
He is acting like a gentleman	Akka nama gaariitti hojjechaa jira
I really don’t need another one	Dhuguma kan biraa na hin barbaachisu
She.	Ishee.
None was clear.	Tokkollee ifa hin turre.
I've never been alone	Ani kophaa ta'ee hin beeku
He didn't tell me anything.	Homaa natti hin himne.
No one could have been more indifferent.	Kana caalaa namni dhimma hin qabne ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I can't see him well enough	Akka gaariitti isa arguu hin danda'u
It was going to be a long year.	Waggaa dheeraa ta'uuf ture.
He wants it in everything	Waan hundumaa keessatti barbaada
You are a good mother.	Ati haadha gaarii dha.
I know him, I know him.	Ani isa beeka.
It’s like everyone else is doing it.	Akka waan namni hundi hojjechaa jiru.
Its time has passed.	Yeroon isaa darbe.
Today, however, is different.	Har'a garuu adda.
I love that dog.	Saree sana nan jaalladha.
I was a person of interest	Ani nama fedhii qabu ture
If you are, you know.	Yoo taate beekta.
We were waiting for you.	Si eegaa turre.
We can never go back.	Yoomiyyuu duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
But that wasn't going to happen.	Garuu sun ta'uuf hin turre.
She was looking right at me.	Isheen sirriitti na ilaalaa turte.
A dog, that’s all, a simple dog	Saree, kana qofa, saree salphaa
That's pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii dha.
He was walking a lot	Baay'ee deemaa ture
Be here now.	Amma as ta'aa.
There wasn't much detail here.	Asitti baay'een bal'aa hin turre.
Asking for help.	Gargaarsa gaafachuu.
Just look around you!.	Naannoo keessan qofa ilaalaa!.
But there is one thing you need to know.	Garuu wanti beekuu qabdu tokko jira.
I couldn't believe it was true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
I certainly have help	Gargaarsa akkan qabu beekamaadha
I'm not going to be	Ani ta'uuf hin deemu
Then it won't happen.	Sana booda hin ta'u.
Of course, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I looked at both of them	Anis lamaan isaanii ilaale
Really, that’s it.	Dhuguma, kanuma.
She certainly knew.	Isheen akka beektu beekamaadha.
It was so right.	Akkas sirrii ture.
But there is nothing more.	Kana caalaa wanti garuu hin jiru.
I shouldn't be important	Ani barbaachisaa ta'uu hin qabu
It was going to be a very long day.	Guyyaa baayyee dheeraa ta'uuf ture.
I think this could be exactly what you are looking for.	Kun sirriitti waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada.
It couldn't have been a boy.	Gurbaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
It seemed a lot longer, longer than it needed to be.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa, kan ta'uu qabu caalaa dheeraa fakkaata ture.
I couldn’t answer it	Deebii itti kennuu hin dandeenye
I couldn’t do that here	Asitti akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
It seems to be coming in the long run.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti waan dhufu fakkaata.
We don’t need any drinks.	Dhugaatii tokkollee nu hin barbaachisu.
Everything seemed fine here.	Asitti wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
It's never happened before.	Kanaan dura ta'ee hin beeku.
I still wasn't sure.	Ammallee mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It may not even be true.	Dhugaa illee ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I have a bad feeling about all of this	Kana hunda irratti miira hamaa qaba
I told him that it was.	Anis akka ta'e itti hime.
I just can't leave them	Isaan dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u
I was just a human being.	Ani nama qofa ture.
Now there is one.	Amma tokko jira.
It’s not just a question.	Gaaffii qofa miti.
Not that she was looking for someone.	Nama barbaadaa turte jechuu miti.
I hope it works out well for you.	Akka gaariitti akka siif ta'u abdiin qaba.
But I didn't think of him that way	Ani garuu akkasitti isa hin yaadne
I enjoyed it very much	Baay'een itti gammade
He wanted me here.	Asitti na barbaade.
But he hadn't worked out what it was.	Garuu maal akka ta'e hin hojjenne ture.
Which they become.	Kan isaan ta'u.
He should have gotten the big one	Silaa isa guddaa sana argachuu qaba ture
I had hardly seen anyone	Nama tokkollee baay'ee hin argine ture
It wasn't much.	Baay'ee hin turre.
It’s really important.	Dhuguma barbaachisaa dha.
I mean, it's a must.	Dirqama jechuu kooti.
I really didn’t want to go along	Dhuguma waliin deemuu hin barbaanne
I can talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu nan danda'a.
I didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I don't think about it	Ani itti hin yaadu
You don’t have that.	Ati akkas hin qabdu.
I know why you did it	Maaliif akka goote nan beeka
This time, however, it is different.	Yeroo kana garuu adda.
I know something happened with him	Waan tokko akka isa waliin ta'e nan beeka
Not to talk to him.	Isa waliin akka hin dubbanne.
We are doing good things.	Waan gaarii hojjechaa jirra.
There is indeed.	Dhuguma ni jira.
Why do you do that.	Maaliif akkas gootu.
But it can’t be that way.	Garuu akkas ta’uu hin danda’u.
But I wasn't sure.	Garuu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
A chance to be that person	Carraa nama sana ta'uuf
I wouldn’t do it.	Ani hin godhu ture.
Soon.	Dhiyootti.
It’s not going to help anything.	Homaa gargaaruuf hin deemu.
Many of us did that.	Baay'een keenya akkas goone.
But at that time	Yeroo sanatti garuu .
I just didn’t see her do it	Ani garuu akka isheen gootu hin argine
I have no interest at all	Fedhii tokkollee hin qabu tasumaa
She was her own.	Isheen kan ishee turte.
Everything was just a question of time.	Wanti hundi gaaffii yeroo qofa ture.
I was there today and couldn't find an answer	Har'a achi ture deebii argachuu hin dandeenye
Then he looked at me.	Sana booda na ilaale.
Maybe I'll never know again.	Tarii kana booda gonkumaa hin beeku ta'a.
Any help you have out there?.	Gargaarsa achi keessaa qabdu jiraa?.
I couldn't stay indoors for a while longer	Kana caalaa yeroo muraasaaf mana keessa turuu hin dandeenye
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
He must have time.	Yeroo qabaachuu qaba.
This probably shouldn’t happen, but it does.	Kun ta’uu hin qabu tarii, garuu ni ta’a.
They want to help you.	Isaan si gargaaruu barbaadu.
I came here to help you	Si gargaaruuf as dhufe
I think people are in a good place	Namoonni bakka gaarii irra jiru jedheen yaada
I was about to become a father	Abbaa ta'uuf jedheen ture
He used to have shoes, new shoes	Duraan kophee, kophee haaraa qaba ture
But only there.	Garuu achi qofa.
This time, it wasn’t.	Yeroo kana, hin turre.
I wanted to do something	Waan tokko hojjechuu barbaade
That's not what happened.	Kan ta'e akkas miti.
I think that’s true	Sun dhugaa natti fakkaata
He has to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu qaba.
I'm going to help.	Gargaaruuf deema.
I didn’t know how to do this	Kana akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku ture
There was more to it than that, of course.	Kana caalaa waan biraa akka ture beekamaadha.
What happened was true.	Wanti ta'e dhugaa ture.
He looked into my eyes	Ija koo keessa ilaale
I still like it, that’s mine	Ammallee natti tola, sun kan kooti
I don’t need anything right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti na hin barbaachisu.
I wasn't really sure what he was here to do	Maal hojjechuuf as akka dhufe dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
I couldn’t find anything like that	Waan akkasii argachuu hin dandeenye
I know you know who he is, what he is.	Eenyu akka ta'e, maal akka ta'e akka beektu nan beeka.
I want to be who you want me to be	Ani eenyu akkan ta'u barbaaddu ta'uu barbaada
I couldn’t quite believe it	Ani guutummaatti amanuu hin dandeenye
It’s not like it used to be.	Akka durii miti.
I hope it helps you	Akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba
I hope I can work with you again	Ammas isin waliin hojjechuu akkan danda'u abdiin qaba
maybe it won’t.	tarii hin ta’u.
I am only kidding, of course.	Ani qoosaa qofa akkan jiru beekamaadha.
He wasn’t even interested	Fedhii illee hin qabu ture
I looked around again	Ammas naannoo koo ilaale
And I was, too.	Anis ture.
I would have said it all the time	Silaa yeroo hunda jedheen ture
They shouldn't be though.	Ta'uu hin qaban garuu.
I like your work.	Hojii kee natti tola.
There was no one to tell us what to do.	Namni maal akka goonu nutti himu hin turre.
Your children in school.	Ijoollee keessan mana barumsaa.
I wouldn’t do that.	Ani akkas hin godhu ture.
She has eyes only for you.	Ija siif qofa qabdi.
But she was here now.	Isheen garuu amma as turte.
This won’t happen for long.	Kun yeroo dheeraaf hin ta’u.
Yours may never be.	Kan kee gonkumaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
She was better than anyone he knew.	Isheen nama inni beeku caalaa gaarii turte.
They can do many things.	Waan hedduu hojjechuu dandaʼu.
Not good in this way.	Haala kanaan gaarii miti.
Now isn't she something.	Amma isheen waan tokko mitii.
I knew something was up	Waan tokko akka ta'e nan beeka ture
Probably, of course.	Tarii, beekamaadha.
That's how it worked.	Akkasitti hojjete.

She wasn’t, but he was.	Isheen hin turre, garuu inni ture.
I want to tell you something.	Waan tokko sitti himuu barbaada.
I knew what this was all about	Wanti kun hundi maal akka taʼe nan beeka ture
That’s not a mistake.	Sun dogoggora miti.

I know what that is.	Sun maal akka ta'e nan beeka.
I should never have gone.	Silaa gonkumaa deemuu hin qabu ture.
I had no idea you existed	Ati akka jirtu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It doesn’t go away for long	Yeroo dheeraa hin deemu
You did me a favor.	Gaarii goote ana.
He wasn’t that great.	Inni hangas guddaa hin turre.
I just didn’t know any other way	Karaa biraa qofa hin beeku ture
Just me, my wife and our dog.	Ana qofa, haadha manaa koo fi saree keenya.
It's very long.	Baayyee dheeraa dha.
We have nothing now.	Amma homaa hin qabnu.
It was too much.	Garmalee ture.
Early and often.	Dafee fi yeroo baay’ee.
He wasn't sure about his father	Waa'ee abbaa isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
It may come later.	Booda dhufuu danda'a ta'uu danda'a.

They will be wrong.	Dogoggora ni ta'u.

We’re doing the best we can.	Waan dandeenyu hunda hojjechaa jirra.

Not tonight but soon.	Halkan kana osoo hin taane yeroo dhiyootti.
None of this could be true.	Kun tokkollee dhugaa ta’uu hin dandeenye.
He was right the whole time	Yeroo sana guutuu sirrii ture
There is no one.	Namni hin jiru.
I told him we could go together	Waliin deemuu akka dandeenyu itti hime
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
Who is she?.	Isheen eenyu?.
But then something happened.	Garuu sana booda wanti tokko ta'e.
If it weren’t easy.	Osoo salphaa hin taane.
But we saw a lot of them.	Garuu baay'ee isaanii argine.
I didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.

You can meet him.	Isa waliin wal arguu dandeessu.
Until then ,	Hanga sanatti .
Maybe she should say something now.	Tarii amma waan tokko dubbachuu qabdi ta'a.
It was someone else.	Nama biraa ture.
I had so many questions as to why	Maaliif jedhee gaaffii baay'een qaba ture
This was his night.	Kun halkan isaa ture.
On.	Irra.
He didn’t do it that morning	Ganama sana hin goone
That's not going to happen.	Sun hin ta'u.
He has been a bad husband and father	Abbaa manaa fi abbaa hamaa ta'ee jira
I know why she knows.	Maaliif akka isheen beektu nan beeka.
But it was there.	Garuu achi ture.
Not much luck there.	Carraa baay'ee achi miti.
She never wanted that.	Isheen gonkumaa akkas hin barbaaddu turte.
That didn’t last long.	Sun yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I have no idea how this works in reality.	Kun dhugaa jiru keessatti akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu.
She is one of us.	Isheen nu keessaa tokko.
He’s going to stay.	Inni turuuf deema.
It didn’t mean trouble.	Rakkoo jechuu hin turre.
But they have to be good.	Garuu gaarii ta'uu qabu.
I know he knows me	Akka inni na beeku nan beeka
They love to eat.	Nyaachuu ni jaallatu.
You can tell them everything you’ve been doing.	Waan hojjechaa turte hunda itti himuu dandeessa.
He knows the truth.	Dhugaa jiru ni beeka.
I thought it would be easy.	Salphaa ta'a jedheen yaade.
It’s a job.	Hojii dha.
This can't be life.	Kun jireenya ta'uu hin danda'u.
She had no hands.	Harka hin qabdu turte.
It is no longer perfect	Kana booda guutuu miti
It was too good to be true.	Garmalee gaarii ture.
It was always about me and just me.	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee koo fi ana qofa ture.
That’s not a question.	Sun gaaffii miti.
Now she doesn't have any.	Amma tokkollee hin qabdu.
One of them was in critical condition.	Isaan keessaa tokko haala hamaa keessa ture.
I wish we could play again	Osoo ammas taphachuu dandeenyu natti tola
This is not the case.	Kun akkas miti.
I think that might not be helpful	Sun gargaarsa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a jedheen yaada
Not right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana miti.

She won’t be around much longer.	Kana caalaa yeroo dheeraaf hin jirtu.
But we were in it.	Garuu keessa turre.
This is not an easy matter	Kun dhimma salphaa miti
I mean really a lot.	Dhuguma baay'ee jechuu kooti.
I don’t really think of him that way.	Dhuguma akkasitti isa hin yaadu.

I did not realize that was a problem	Sun rakkoo akka taʼe hin hubanne
It was just the two of them.	Isaan lamaan qofa ture.
We did it in the past.	Yeroo darbe hojjenne.
This is not one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko miti.
I couldn’t help but forgive him	Dhiifama isaaf gochuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye

In two parts.	Kutaa lama keessatti.
When in this situation.	Yeroo haala kana keessa jiru.

I mean, it's not like that	Akkas miti jechuu kooti
I want to tell him about it but I can't	Waa'ee isaa itti himuu barbaada garuu hin danda'u
Any one of us could have done something similar.	Nu keessaa namni tokko illee waan wal fakkaatu hojjechuu dandaʼa ture.
There’s just nothing there.	Achitti homaa hin jiru qofa.
But sometimes.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko.
This has never happened.	Kun ta'ee hin beeku.

How do they do that.	Akkamitti akkas godhu.

I know what we have to do	Waan gochuu qabnu nan beeka
I'm a guy.	Ana gurbaa.
Day in and day out.	Guyyaa keessaa fi guyyaa keessaa.
He wants one.	Tokko barbaada.
He wanted to know what she thought	Maal akka yaaddu beekuu barbaade
I’m not going to go for it	Ani itti hin deemu
But he was right.	Garuu inni sirrii ture.
Little things.	Wantoota xiqqoo.
She certainly thought nothing of it.	Isheen homaa akka itti hin yaadne beekamaadha.
But it’s still human.	Garuu ammallee nama.
You’re new here.	Asitti haaraa taate.
What he said was so true.	Wanti inni jedhe akka malee dhugaa ture.
But this is not what you want.	Garuu kun waan ati barbaaddu miti.
He knew who he was.	Eenyu akka ta'e ni beeka ture.
But there are	Garuu ni jiru .
I don't want that to happen anymore.	Kana booda akkas ta'uu hin barbaadu.
He can go home soon.	Dafee gara manaatti deebi'uu danda'a.
It wasn't and it never was.	Hin turre ammas ta'ee hin beeku.
Sometimes he’s right, but most of the time he’s wrong.	Yeroo tokko tokko sirrii dha, garuu yeroo baay’ee dogoggora.
Our work.	Hojii keenya.
Who was he, really.	Inni eenyu ture, dhuguma.
It would have been just fine	Silaa gaarii qofa ture
When playing.	Yeroo taphachuu.
There was no man before him.	Namni isa dura hin turre.
I can't believe he would do that	Akkas godha jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I think he really cares about me	Inni dhuguma naaf yaadu natti fakkaata
It had three rooms.	Kutaa sadii qaba ture.
Purpose.	Dhimma.
I always knew you were special	Yeroo hundumaa adda akka taate nan beeka ture
That’s how they think.	Akkasitti yaadu.
I have a job, but I can't help myself	Hojii qaba, garuu of gargaaruu hin danda'u
They are not the same.	Isaan tokko miti.
I think he enjoyed that	Sana itti gammade natti fakkaata
This has been going on for a long time, of course.	Kun yeroo dheeraaf akka ture beekamaadha.
It wasn’t mine.	Kan koo hin turre.
I couldn’t have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
He can play it.	Taphachuu danda'a.
Mine was fine.	Kan koo gaarii ture.
I want to give him a chance	Carraa isaaf kennuu barbaada
A big dog, a dog.	Saree guddaa, saree.
It was so true.	Akkas dhugaa ture.
It’s huge, it’s huge.	Guddaa, guddaa dha.
I mean, there was a time when he was	Yeroon inni ture tokko ture jechuu kooti
This may not be what you want.	Kun waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
But they do.	Garuu ni godhu.
I know someone like that	Nama akkasii nan beeka
He should have known there was more.	Kana caalaa akka jiru beekuu qaba ture.
People are watching.	Namoonni ilaalaa jiru.
I don’t know what to make of that.	Sana maal akka godhu hin beeku.
I'm going to go too.	Anis deemaa jira.
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
But I doubt it.	Garuu shakka.
That didn’t work.	Sun hin hojjenne.
Really a lot.	Dhuguma baay'ee.
Then again, it may not.	Sana booda ammas ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I was here watching their lives	Jireenya isaanii ilaalaa as ture
He thought about everything she said	Waan isheen jette hunda yaade
I doubt anyone knew they had it together	Waliin akka qaban namni beeku akka jiru nan shakka
I didn’t know she was with you	Isheen si waliin akka jirtu hin beeku ture
Maybe it's for us.	Tarii nuuf ta'a.
This was something new.	Kun waan haaraa ture.
It is in their hands.	Harka isaanii keessa jira.
He has to go.	Inni deemuu qaba.
Before all this, he was fine	Kana hunda dura gaarii ture
It was there, it worked.	Achi ture, hojjete.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
We need work.	Hojiin nu barbaachisa.
So they go for three days.	Kanaaf guyyaa sadii deemu.
He got another drink.	Dhugaatii biraa argate.
You never know.	Ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
They were very good.	Baayyee gaarii turan.
It wasn't what he was expecting.	Waan inni eegaa ture hin turre.
I know what we have to do	Waan gochuu qabnu nan beeka
It is an even more important book.	Kana caalaa kitaaba barbaachisaa dha.
It didn’t work out well.	Akka gaariitti hin hojjenne.
Love the light within the light.	Ifa ifa keessaa jaalladhu.
A stranger wouldn't know anything about me	Namni hin beekne waan waa'ee koo beeku hin beeku ture
I can get that one	Isa sana argachuu danda'a
They know what is needed.	Waan barbaachisu ni beeku.
Of course, we have problems.	Rakkoo akka qabnu beekamaadha.
I thought that was a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaate.
She said she loved me.	Na jaalladha jette.
I know you can do better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu akka dandeessu nan beeka.
This time it seems again.	Yeroo kana ammas fakkaata.
He had a real thing last year.	Waan dhugaa bara darbe qaba ture.
That wasn’t true at the time.	Yeroo sanatti sun dhugaa hin turre.
I am sure about that	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa dha
We have a lot going for this year.	Bara kanaaf waan baay'ee qabna.
I didn’t see anyone else	Nama biraa hin argine
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
He is a man like me.	Nama akka kooti.
It's just like that.	Akkas qofa.
I couldn't have done it.	Silaa gochuu hin danda'u ture.
You don’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beektu.
But this doesn't work.	Kun garuu hin hojjetu.
I thought it would happen.	Ni ta'a jedheen yaade.
I can't believe he wants any of those things	Wantoota sana keessaa tokko illee akka barbaadu amanuu hin danda'u
I wasn’t home even when he left.	Yeroo inni deemu illee mana hin turre.
But that was it.	Garuu kanuma ture.
I still have that book.	Kitaaba sana ammallee qaba.
He says he is one of them.	Inni isaan keessaa tokko jedha.
I can't just go walk down the aisle with you	Si waliin karaa irra deemuu qofa deemuu hin danda'u
He wants to help.	Gargaaruu barbaada.
But she didn't want to.	Isheen garuu hin barbaanne.
I shouldn’t give it a chance anymore	Kana booda carraa kennuu hin qabu
But wait, that’s not all.	Garuu eegaa, kana qofa miti.
That can't be a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I certainly am.	Ani akkan jiru beekamaadha.
He is a very good father.	Abbaa baayyee gaarii dha.
Where was that, he wondered.	Sun eessa ture jedhee yaade.
But now you can't see it.	Amma garuu arguu hin dandeessu.
But it’s not working.	Garuu hojjechaa hin jiru.
I am inside him, inside her.	Ani keessa isaa, keessa ishee jira.
But I didn't tell anyone	Ani garuu namatti hin himne
No one but him went up.	Isa malee namni ol ba'e hin jiru.
They have nothing in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu hin qaban.
I don't do this.	Ani kana hin godhu.
He knew exactly what he was talking about	Waan inni jedhu sirriitti beeka ture
I knew the real answer	Deebii dhugaa isaa nan beeka ture
I love everything he does.	Waan inni hojjetu hunda nan jaalladha.
Everything went clear.	Wanti hundi ifa ta'ee deeme.
I couldn't find it.	Argachuu hin dandeenye.
I'm pretty sure you already know this	Kana duruu akka beektu mirkanaa'aa dha
I know how and why this happens	Kun akkamitti fi maaliif akka ta'u nan beeka
I said you can see her tomorrow	Boru ishee arguu dandeessa jedheen
No one was happy at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namni gammade hin jiru.
I was no better than her	Ani ishee caalaa hin turre
Like maybe not anymore.	Akkuma tarii kana booda hin taane.
It always worked.	Yeroo hundumaa hojjeta ture.
I didn't realize it was really happening	Dhuguma akka ta'aa jiru hin hubanne
I couldn't do it.	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye.
I couldn’t help but respond	Deebii kennuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I didn't see you there either	Anis achitti si hin argine
I hope it’s not bad.	Hamaa akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
I don't like him.	Ani isa hin jaalladhu.
He's doing fine.	Inni gaarii ta'aa jira.
I had better go	Ani deemuun naaf wayya ture
This isn't going to happen.	Kun hin ta'u.
I don't want a wife.	Ani haadha manaa hin barbaadu.
He had an idea.	Yaada tokko qaba ture.
I had no intention of doing this	Kana gochuuf yaada hin qabu ture
Not just knowing what happened there.	Waan achitti ta'e beekuu qofa miti.
That's what happens.	Kan ta'u kanuma.
Everything is in place.	Wanti hundi bakka isaa jira.
We are the parents.	Nuti warra.
But, it doesn’t work.	Garuu, hin hojjetu.
I thought you were good at that	Kana irratti ati gaarii natti fakkaate
He loves his job.	Hojii isaa ni jaallata.
I hoped he knew that	Kana akka beeku abdiin qaba ture
I saw him walking into your bar	Mana dhugaatii keessan keessa yeroo deemu arge
Then he went out.	Yeroo sana ba'e.
How did you do it?.	Akkamitti goote?.
He couldn't be.	Inni ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I will make everything perfect	Ani waan hundumaa guutuu nan godha
But I want to see you in the morning	Ani garuu ganama si arguu nan barbaada
It takes time.	Yeroo barbaada.
We couldn’t eat when we wanted to.	Yeroo barbaanne nyaachuu hin dandeenye.
This isn’t a big deal.	Kun waan guddaa miti.
This very good life	Jireenya baayyee gaarii kana
That’s ours.	Sun kan keenya.
One of us, always.	Tokko keenya, yeroo hundumaa.
When it comes to.	Yeroo gara.
We have it tomorrow.	Boru qabna.
He knew exactly what had happened	Waan ta'e sirriitti beeka ture
This is the biggest problem.	Rakkoo guddaa kana.
But it looked like her.	Garuu ishee fakkaata ture.
Perhaps that is the problem.	Tarii rakkoon sun kanuma taʼuu dandaʼa.
I need some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
About three times.	Gara yeroo sadii.
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
People know us.	Namoonni nu beeku.
This is my own.	Kun kan kooti.
What a situation.	Haala maal.
Something from him, perhaps.	Waan tokko isa irraa, tarii.
I mean, he should have, maybe	Silaa qaba ture jechuu kooti, ​​tarii
So, you know,.	Kanaaf, beekta,.
Nothing else did.	Wanti biraa hin goone.
We’re doing the best we can.	Waan dandeenyu hunda hojjechaa jirra.
I could get my chance one day	Carraa koo guyyaa tokko argachuu nan danda'a ture
It was so nice to do this.	Kana gochuun baay'ee namatti tola ture.
She has an opinion on everything.	Waan hundumaa irratti yaada qabdi.
This was their daily routine.	Kun hojii isaanii guyyaa guyyaa ture.
I think of the problem	Rakkoo jiru nan yaada
He was my everything.	Inni waan hundumaa koo ture.
It has been a good life.	Jireenya gaarii ta'ee jira.
Now it will happen.	Amma ni ta'a.
With the two of them, in my house.	Isaan lamaan waliin, mana koo keessatti.
They all look like this one.	Hundi isaanii isa kana fakkaatu.
Still, he hadn't said anything.	Ammas ta'ee homaa hin dubbanne ture.
But nothing else did.	Garuu wanti biraa hin goone.
I didn’t know him well	Ani sirriitti isa hin beeku ture
I haven’t seen them, simple as that.	Isaan hin argine, salphaa akka sanaa.
They’re out there, boys.	Isaan ala jiru gurbaa.
I can't see him.	Isa arguu hin danda'u.
So it goes away.	Kanaaf ni deema.
I’ve been looking for you	Si barbaadaa tureera
It was a terrible night.	Halkan hamaa ture.
He should be clear about that.	Waa'ee sanaa ifa ta'uu qaba.
I feel for you on that one.	Isa sana irratti siif miira.
It’s just a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa.
There is no emotion in his voice.	Sagalee isaa keessatti miira hin qabu.
I'm sure nothing.	Homaa akka hin jirre mirkanaa'adha.
I didn’t think anyone else was	Namni biraa waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu ture
This is probably correct.	Kun sirrii taʼuu hin oolu.
I always wanted them, but it never happened	Yeroo hundumaa isaan barbaada ture, garuu gonkumaa hin taane
He asked me a few questions.	Gaaffii muraasa na gaafate.
I could live there for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf achi jiraachuu nan dandaʼa ture
To make things less easy.	Wantoota salphaa akka hin taane gochuuf.
To do more.	Caalaatti hojjechuuf.
I told him the idea.	Anis yaada sana itti hime.
It just seemed wrong.	Dogoggora qofa fakkaata ture.
It was true, of course.	Dhugaa ture, beekamaadha.
Everything went well.	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti deeme.
It was his idea.	Yaada isaa ture.
I knew inside that he was good	Inni gaarii akka taʼe keessa kootti nan beeka ture
Those were great.	Isaan sun guddaa turan.
He goes on his own.	Ofii isaatiin deema.
But he was only one man.	Inni garuu nama tokko qofa ture.
I hope this happens	Kun akka ta'u abdiin qaba
Wait a moment and see.	Yeroo muraasa eegaa ilaalaa.
It just works a lot.	Baayyee hojjeta qofa.
I couldn’t help but respond	Deebii kennuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
He saw too much of me in her	Ishee keessatti garmalee na arge
But you did your best.	Ati garuu waan dandeessu hunda goote.
I love making my own	Kan koo hojjechuu nan jaalladha
It's been great.	Guddaa ta'ee jira.
If not, it probably is.	Yoo hin taane ta'uu hin oolu.
It wasn’t always on the road.	Yeroo hunda karaa irra hin turre.
I want to be a teacher	Barsiisaa ta'uu barbaada
Having someone that wants her so much.	Nama akkasitti ishee barbaadu qabaachuu.
I can't tell you any more	Kana caalaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
A lot of things like that happened	Wanti akkasii baay'een ta'e
But she just wasn’t there.	Garuu isheen achi hin turre qofa.
That would be the right person to do that.	Sun nama sirrii akkas godhu ta'a.
I wouldn’t know what to say	Silaa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
She is no longer there.	Kana booda hin jirtu.
It couldn't have been true.	Silaa dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
There is no hope in it.	Abdiin keessa hin jiru.
He should not have done this	Silaa kana gochuu hin qabu ture
We can't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeenyu.
I knew what was coming.	Waan dhufu nan beeka ture.
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't know that about him.	Waa'ee isaa akkas hin beeku ture.
I was really happy with how it turned out	Akkamitti akka ta'e baay'een gammade
They can do a lot of work.	Hojii baay'ee hojjechuu danda'u.
You don't know if they're right or not.	Sirrii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaanii hin beektu.
It could be a job.	Hojii ta'uu danda'a.
We thought it would be for him.	Isaaf akka ta'uuf yaadne.
I don't know if that's the case.	Akkas ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
I didn't know much about her other than her name	Maqaa ishee malee waa'ee ishee waan baay'ee hin beeku ture
She wasn’t the only one.	Ishee qofa hin turre.
I was there alone with no money	Ani kophaa koo qarshii tokko malee achi ture
I love him more and more	Ani caalaatti isa jaalladha
They should be helpful.	Gargaarsa ta'uu qabu.
But the task will not be easy.	Hojiin sun garuu salphaa hin ta'u.
This was not clear.	Kun ifa hin turre.
He’s right, but it doesn’t matter.	Inni sirrii dha, garuu homaa hin qabu.
Didn't see them very often	Yeroo baay'ee isaan hin argine
I still love her.	Ammallee ishee jaalladha.
It should be everyone.	Nama hunda ta'uu qaba.
I don't know why, really.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku, dhuguma.
They tell us what happened.	Waan ta'e nutti himu.
I want to get to know you	Si beekuu barbaada
But she was different.	Isheen garuu adda turte.
They shouldn't be a problem.	Rakkoo ta'uu hin qaban.
He got it right	Inni sirriitti argate
I mean the whole situation.	Haala guutuu jechuu kooti.
It seems clear to us that there is.	Akka jiru ifa nutti fakkaata.
I wanted something else entirely.	Guutummaatti waan biraa barbaade.
He might know what that is.	Sun maal akka taʼe beekuu dandaʼa.
He says he’s going with her.	Ishee waliin deema jedha.
This would be enough.	Kun gahaa ta'a ture.
I didn’t have that kind of money	Maallaqa akkasii hin qabu ture
There is no other reason.	Sababni biraa hin jiru.
He didn’t know his way around.	Karaa isaa naannoo isaa hin beekne.
When in his opinion such.	Yeroo akka yaada isaatti akkasii.
There are a lot of people right now	Namoonni baay'een yeroo ammaa jiru
I really can't believe it	Dhuguma amanuu hin danda'u
You can do this.	Kana gochuu dandeessa.
I wish everyone knew that	Osoo namni hundi akkas beeku natti tola
I want you to go with me	Akka na waliin deemtu nan barbaada
No one else does.	Namni biraa hin godhu.
I didn’t think anything of it at the time	Yeroo sanatti homaa itti hin yaadne
He would have to do all that tomorrow.	Boru sana hunda gochuu qaba ture.
Something special	Waan adda ta'e
He wasn’t going to do that.	Inni akkas gochuuf hin turre.
But he could do it.	Garuu ni danda'a ture.
Just that one thing.	Waan tokko sana qofa.
More than good.	Gaarii caalaa.
I doubt this is the case.	Kun akka ta'e nan shakka.
He wants what is best for him.	Waan isaaf gaarii ta'e barbaada.
But I didn't understand	Ani garuu hin hubanne ture
I knew you were a good person	Nama gaarii akka taate nan beeka ture
It really doesn’t matter	Dhuguma homaa hin qabu
This, however, did not seem to work.	Kun garuu waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu ture.
I didn’t understand any of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin hubanne.
I can't let that happen	Akkas akka ta'u gochuu hin danda'u
There just aren't many there.	Baay'een achi hin jiru qofa.
No one likes them, no one wants them.	Namni isaan jaallatu hin jiru, namni isaan barbaadu hin jiru.
This is nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa miti.
We are doing good things.	Waan gaarii hojjechaa jirra.
Sometimes it is very unclear to me.	Yeroon tokko tokko baayyee naaf ifa miti.
You don't know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru hin beektu.
It didn’t go well.	Akka gaariitti hin deemne.
It's never been like that.	Akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
I think it's true.	Dhugaa natti fakkaata.
It was always a problem.	Yeroo hundumaa rakkoo ture.
I like this house.	Mana kana natti tola.
How many hours.	Sa'aatii meeqa.
I had no idea she was so tiny.	Akkas xiqqoo akka taate yaada hin qabu ture.
We don’t do that here.	Asitti akkas hin goonu.
I love you, you know that	Si jaalladha, ati kana beekta
Everything is not about you.	Wanti hundi waa'ee kee miti.
I am not your father.	Ani abbaa kee miti.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
It almost looks like that.	Akkas fakkaata jechuun ni danda'ama.
It was nowhere to go.	Bakka itti deemu hin turre.
I have no idea how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu.
No one knew where she was.	Eessa akka jirtu namni beeku hin turre.
I always liked it there	Yeroo hundumaa achitti natti tola ture
Obviously no one told me.	Ifa qaba namni natti hime hin jiru.
Big money and everyone wants that.	Maallaqa guddaa fi sana namni hundi barbaada.
He can't be.	Inni ta'uu hin danda'u.
They didn’t need it.	Isaan hin barbaachifne.
I hope you like them	Akka isaan jaallattu abdiin qaba
It was really bad for him	Dhuguma itti hamaa ture
I can still see.	Ammas arguu danda'a.
I wondered why he wanted to see me	Maaliif na arguu barbaade jedheen yaade
This time around.	Yeroo kana.
We went inside.	Keessa deemne.
I want him here with me	Ani as na waliin isa barbaada
He knows he made a mistake.	Dogoggora akka hojjete ni beeka.
He thought about the question	Gaaffii jedhu irratti yaade
He's doing his best.	Waan danda'u hunda hojjechaa jira.
I’m working on that.	Sana irratti hojjechaa jira.
He shouldn’t have spoken to me like that.	Silaa akkasitti natti dubbachuu hin qabu ture.
I suggest you look for someone else	Nama biraa akka barbaaddu yaada kooti
She really needed to sleep.	Dhuguma hirriba ishee barbaachisa ture.
Maybe we don't need it.	Tarii nu hin barbaachisu ta'a.
He knew his mother well	Haadha isaa sirriitti beeka ture
It really looked more like some of the guys in the background.	Dhuguma caalaatti gurbaa tokko tokko duubatti fakkaate.
Like a lot of kids really.	Akka ijoollee baay'ee dhuguma.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
I have a lot going on with school right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana mana barumsaa wajjin waan baay'ee deemaa jira.
They? 	Isaan?
Then it will happen.	Sana booda ni ta'a.
I'm sure he has his way	Karaa isaa akka qabu mirkanaa'adha
I like his idea.	Yaada isaa natti tola.
Tell your dog you want that person.	Nama sana akka barbaaddu saree kee itti himi.
I watched them for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan ilaalaa ture
I knew there could be none	Tokkollee jiraachuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture
I was never sure she really loved him	Dhuguma akka isa jaallattu mirkanaa'aa ta'ee hin beeku
It was going to be her big chance.	Carraa ishee guddaa ta'uuf ture.
I thought it had already gone	Duraan waan deeme natti fakkaate
He could play anything if we wanted him to	Yoo nuti barbaanne waan hunda taphachuu danda'a ture
I need to know how you did it	Akkamitti akka kana goote beekuu qaba
I'll be going soon	Yeroo dhiyootti nan deema
But I want to be	Ani garuu ta'uu nan barbaada
He gave it to me.	Naaf kenne.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
I can't believe it's working so quickly	Dafee hojjechaa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I want to ask you some questions	Gaaffii tokko tokko isin gaafachuu barbaada
I have no idea what to do with them	Maal akkan isaan godhu yaada hin qabu
But it's not really about that.	Garuu dhuguma waa'ee sanaa miti.
I’ve always been so happy	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti gammadeera
There is nothing for him.	Wanti isaaf ta'u hin jiru.
That doesn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu.
I will always love you more than myself	Yeroo hundumaa of caalaa si jaalladha
These people are still working.	Namoonni kun ammallee hojjechaa jiru.
I looked at the door to my room	Balbala kutaa koo ilaale
It obviously didn’t work very well.	Baayyee akka gaariitti akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
I just didn’t know what else to do	Waan biraa akkan godhu qofa hin beeku ture
I can't say what it was	Maal akka ture dubbachuu hin danda'u
You have a lot to do.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabda.
Now I had to do something	Amma waan tokko gochuun qaba ture
They think a lot.	Baay'ee yaadu.
I had to make it work	Akka hojjetu gochuun qaba ture
But I don't know how to say it	Akkamitti akkan jedhu garuu hin beeku
They have two children together.	Ijoollee lama waliin qabu.
Except it couldn't be that way.	Akkas ta'uu hin dandeenye malee.
I know you know what you’re doing	Waan gootu akka beektu nan beeka
I can't do more for him now	Amma kana caalaa isaaf gochuu hin danda'u
I’m happy with my luck.	Carraa kootti gammadeera.
I really like this one	Isa kana baayyee natti tola
I don’t know him at all	Ani tasumaa isa hin beeku
I was expecting more	Kana caalaa eegaa ture
I can tell you the truth	Dhugaa jiru sitti himuu nan danda'a
He said he saw me more than his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa caalaa na arge jedhe.
You can live longer.	Yeroo dheeraa jiraachuu dandeessa.
Ideas in the room.	Yaada kutaa keessaa.
That's not always the case.	Yeroo hunda akkas hin ta'u.
He says you can't.	Hin dandeessu jedha.
I certainly love her	Ani akkan ishee jaalladhu beekamaadha
He did not seek their help	Gargaarsa isaanii hin barbaanne
I can't live with myself anymore	Kana booda of waliin jiraachuu hin danda'u
He didn’t go.	Hin deemne.
I was very happy that year	Bara sana baay'een gammade
It wasn’t a job.	Hojii hin turre.
I think you can go home now	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeessa jedheen yaada
I may be the exception.	Ani kanaan ala ta'uu danda'a.
It was from his parents.	Warra isaa irraa ture.
It went big then.	Yeroo sanatti guddaa deeme.
But it will happen soon.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti ni ta'a.
He likes that idea.	Yaada sana ni jaallata.
I had two from my mother	Haadha koo irraa lama qaba ture
She was there for a couple of months.	Ji'a lama lama achi turte.
I only have you two	Ani isin lamaan qofa qaba
It works perfectly fine.	Guutummaatti gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
You're most likely.	Ati baay'ee hin oolu.
This is not one of her good days.	Kun guyyaa gaarii ishee keessaa tokko miti.
Might do another two	Lamaan biraa hojjechuu danda'a
I think that would have been so good for you	Silaa akkas siif gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
He has such a problem	Rakkoo akkasii qaba
I know that feeling.	Miira sana nan beeka.
Very .	Baayyee .
You can get back to us.	Nutti deebi'uu dandeessu.
No answer with the environment.	Naannoo waliin deebii hin qabu.
I’m not going anywhere else but here	As malee bakka biraa hin deemu
I'm enjoying it.	Ani itti gammadeera.
People were up there.	Namoonni achi ol turan.
He looked great.	Inni guddaa fakkaata ture.
It’s my father.	Abbaa kooti.
I could no longer live without her	Kana booda ishee malee jiraachuu hin danda'u ture
It wasn't going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin turre.
She hadn’t even gone.	Isheen illee hin deemne turte.
He did everything he could.	Waan danda'u hunda godhe.
You have two hours.	Sa'aatii lama qabda.
She needed much, much more.	Kana caalaa baayʼee baayʼee ishee barbaachisa ture.
He obviously doesn’t exist.	Inni akka hin jirre ifaadha.
I am not in my house.	Ani mana koo keessa hin jiru.
I know a lot about her, but certainly not everything	Waa'ee ishee waan baay'een beeka, garuu waan hundumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha
Should be a great time!.	Yeroo guddaa ta'uu qaba!.
I doubt whether you’ll find anything	Waan tokko argachuu fi dhiisuu kee nan shakka
You can’t stay here any longer.	Kana caalaa as turuu hin dandeessu.
Here, it was different.	Asitti, adda ture.
Everything is working except this one thing.	Waan tokko kana malee wanti hundi hojjechaa jira.
I wouldn't tell him anything about real feelings	Waa'ee miira dhugaa homaa itti hin himu ture
But mostly they love money.	Garuu irra caalaa maallaqa jaallatu.
No job, no wife.	Hojii hin qabu, haadha manaa hin qabu.
They need to see that this is nothing.	Kun homaa akka hin taane arguu qabu.
I really don’t think it matters.	Dhuguma waan dhimma qabu natti hin fakkaatu.
I didn't know if you knew	Beektu ta'uu hin beeku ture
She had the reality now.	Dhugaa jiru amma qabdi turte.
I really didn’t want to know.	Dhuguma beekuu hin barbaanne.
He didn't have to do that.	Akkas gochuun isa hin barbaachifne ture.
I haven’t been here before	Kanaan dura as hin turre
But they were no longer children.	Garuu kana booda ijoollee hin turre.
He loved many people.	Namoota baayʼee ni jaallata ture.
Nothing seemed to work for me.	Wanti naaf hojjetu hin fakkaatu ture.
I wonder when this happened	Kun yoom ta'e jedheen yaada
I'd rather not talk about it	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu dhiisuu naaf wayya
Now he had her.	Amma ishee qaba ture.
saw.	arge.
But there is nothing we can do about it now.	Garuu amma wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
Lots of reasons for it.	Sababni baay'ee isaaf.
Not very long.	Baayyee dheeraa miti.
She obviously does.	Isheen akka gootu ifaadha.
Local, local, local.	Naannoo, naannoo, naannoo.
But I haven’t even done that much yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti hanga kana illee hin hojjenne.
It was always going to be this way	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'uuf ture
Hope that helps some.	Sun tokko tokko akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I knew nothing about it until after it happened	Hanga ta'ee booda waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture
I wondered where that went	Sun eessa deeme jedheen yaade
I have no idea why that is	Maaliif akkas ta'e yaada hin qabu
I don’t think it works.	Waan hojjetu natti hin fakkaatu.
That you can do something like that.	Waan akkasii hojjechuu akka dandeessu.
I didn’t understand.	Hin hubanne.
I don't want that to happen.	Akkas akka ta'u hin barbaadu.
We hope it helps.	Akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
The timing is different.	Yeroon isaa adda.
You know this could be good for me.	Kun naaf gaarii ta'uu akka danda'u beekta.
I know you weren’t mean in your opinion	Yaada kee irratti akka ati hamaa hin turre nan beeka
That was never me.	Sun gonkumaa ana hin turre.
We did the best we could.	Waan dandeenyu hunda hojjenne.
You don’t know these people.	Namoota kana hin beektu.
I didn’t know what to say to these people	Namoota kanaan maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
I saw him again.	Ammas isa arge.
We were hers.	Nuti kan ishee turre.
I think this is a good time	Yeroon kun gaarii natti fakkaata
They had questions.	Gaaffii qaban turan.
How you navigate the environment matters.	Akkamitti naannoo keessa akka deemtu dhimma qaba.
It was my duty.	Dirqama koo ture.
Not even his mother.	Haadha isaa illee miti.
I am very happy to meet you	Isin wal arguu kootti baay'een gammade
He had a lot going for him.	Waan baay'ee itti deemu qaba ture.
They have their best and worst moments now.	Yeroo gaarii fi hamaa isaanii amma qabu.
I want to know everything about you	Waa'ee kee hunda beekuu barbaada
From the right place.	Bakka sirrii ta’e irraa.
I didn't know that.	Kana hin beeku ture.
I was watching, too	Anis ilaalaa ture
A week passed without the slightest interest	Torban tokko fedhii xiqqoo malee darbe
I have many questions on my time	Yeroo koo irratti gaaffii hedduu qaba
I have many thoughts on this	Kana irratti yaada hedduu qaba
He didn’t do it once.	Yeroo tokkollee hin goone.
I have no one but her	Ishee malee nama hin qabu
He had a bad one.	Inni hamaa qaba ture.
I like this but it’s not unique	Kana natti tola garuu adda miti
I’ve been here a long time, watching you	Yeroo dheeraaf as ture, isin ilaalaa jira
A year ago it should have been hers	Waggaa tokko dura silaa kan ishee ta'uu qaba ture
I never intended to do that	Ani tasumaa akkas gochuuf hin yaadne
I mean, all the time	Yeroo hunda jechuu kooti
I wasn’t waiting for you	Si eegaa hin turre
They know each other.	Wal beeku.
Now a lot of people know us. 	Amma namoonni baay'een nu beeku. 
How did it happen.	Akkamitti ta'e.
It's just life.	Jireenya qofa.
I need a lot of time alone	Kophaa koo yeroo baay'ee na barbaachisa
I know you don’t want to come here but you have to.	As dhufuu akka hin barbaanne nan beeka garuu qabda.
They could have helped me, but they never could.	Silaa na gargaaruu dandaʼu turan, garuu gonkumaa na gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
People say that, but it’s not the same thing.	Namoonni akkas jedhu, garuu waan tokko miti.
But now there is no more.	Amma garuu kana caalaa hin jiru.
I still don’t understand what he wants.	Ammallee waan inni barbaadu hin hubanne.
Look at my house.	Mana koo ilaalaa.
The same reason.	Sababni wal fakkaatu.
I couldn’t work out the context.	Haala yaada keessa jiru hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
Someone has to eat.	Namni tokko nyaachuu qaba.
I can't do it anymore	Kana booda gochuu hin danda'u
This one wasn’t.	Inni kun hin turre.
I have no desire to stay any longer	Kana booda turuuf fedhii hin qabu
He was right of course.	Inni sirrii ture beekamaadha.
Not sure anyone would.	Namni akkas godhu mirkanaa'aa miti.
I wouldn’t have thought you two were friends	Silaa isin lamaan hiriyyoota natti hin fakkaatu ture
Then again, it may not be true.	Sana booda ammas dhugaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
It should have been.	Silaa ta'uu qaba ture.
I'm looking for her.	Ani ishee barbaada.
He's doing great today.	Har'a waan guddaa hojjechaa jira.
Not yesterday, not tomorrow, but today.	Kaleessa miti, boru miti, har'a malee.
I wasn't even sure if they were around	Naannoo isaanii jiraachuu fi dhiisuu isaanii illee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I thought so, too.	Anis akkas jedheen yaade.
But it didn’t look good.	Garuu gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
Then they think again.	Sana booda ammas yaadu.
He had no answer	Deebii homaa hin qabu ture
No one said that happened	Namni akkas ta'e jedhe hin jiru
I think he just got lucky	Carraa qofa argate natti fakkaata
I don’t know why it didn’t last.	Maaliif akka hin turre hin beeku.
I am extremely self-aware	Ani garmalee of beeka
You seem to be in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirtu fakkaata.
She did that today.	Har'a akkas goote.
I certainly am.	Ani akkan jiru beekamaadha.
He didn’t do it.	Inni hin goone.
She was a very good mother.	Haadha baayyee gaarii turte.
We weren’t like that.	Nuti akkas hin turre.
I didn’t want to, really	Ani hin barbaanne, dhuguma
I don’t need that.	Sana na hin barbaachisu.
Almost everyone has a car.	Namni hundi konkolaataa qaba jechuun ni danda'ama.
I have a feeling like that	Miira akkas ta'e qaba
Maybe he already had.	Tarii duraan qaba ture ta'a.
Time was money.	Yeroon maallaqa ture.
I wasn't too sure why	Maaliif akka ta'e garmalee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I used to be looking for a name	Duraan maqaa barbaadaa ture
I wanted him in my arms	Harka kootti isa barbaade
But he loves it.	Garuu ni jaallata.
I’ve said worse than that	Kana caalaa hamaa jedheen jira
I know what he wants me to do	Waan akkan godhu na barbaadu nan beeka
I can't see him.	Isa arguu hin danda'u.
It wasn't very specific in your answer though.	Deebii kee keessatti garuu baay'ee adda hin turre.
Join us now.	Amma nu waliin ta'aa.
I know you’ve wanted this for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf kana akka barbaaddu nan beeka
I didn't really know who he was	Dhuguma eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
That says something	Sun waan tokko jedha
I was three years old at the time	Yeroo sanatti umuriin koo waggaa sadii ture
But even that is usually not needed.	Garuu sun illee yeroo baayyee hin barbaachisu.
I mean, everything went well.	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti deeme jechuu kooti.
He saw everything.	Waan hundumaa arge.
He didn't do that.	Akkas hin goone.
So he needed time.	Kanaaf yeroo isa barbaachisa ture.
I don't have a problem with this now	Kana amma rakkoo hin qabu
It still wasn’t easy.	Ammas salphaa hin turre.
I knew it was good.	Gaarii akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
Which is wrong.	Kan dogoggora ta'e.
We need this.	Kana nu barbaachisa.
He didn't want food.	Nyaata hin barbaanne.
I definitely don’t have it anymore	Kana booda akkan hin qabne beekamaadha
That should do it.	Sun gochuu qaba.
That is our problem.	Rakkoon keenya kanuma.
I knew you didn’t understand at the time.	Yeroo sanatti siif hin galle nan beeka ture.
I didn't say anything.	Ani homaa hin dubbanne.
I must have it.	Ani qabaachuu qaba.
Nothing mattered but his work.	Hojii isaa malee wanti barbaachisaa hin turre.
We used to be roommates on the road.	Duraan karaa irratti kutaa waliin turre.
I wanted to stay with him	Isa bira turuu barbaade
I knew it would be a disaster.	Balaa akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
It could have been more of a person.	Silaa caalaatti nama tokko ta'uu danda'a ture.
None was too much.	Tokkollee baay'ee ture.
Maybe it's too much.	Tarii garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t know what else to say	Kan biraa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
That’s really not that different.	Sun dhuguma akkas adda miti.
I couldn’t ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
I’ve never been on one before.	Kana dura tokko irra turee hin beeku.
I still have no chance.	Ammas carraa hin qabu.
He didn’t really want her.	Dhuguma ishee hin barbaanne.
I couldn’t stay a moment longer	Kana caalaa yeroo muraasaaf turuu hin dandeenye
She had said.	Jettee turte.
I thought it was good.	Anis gaarii natti fakkaate.
What is the problem.	Rakkoon jiru maali.
But there was nothing else.	Garuu wanti biraa hin turre.
But he couldn't do it.	Garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
If he goes away.	Yoo inni deeme.
He’s always been very clear on that.	Yeroo hundumaa sana irratti baay’ee ifa ture.
So far, we don't have much of the facts in front of us.	Hanga ammaatti dhugaa jiru nu dura jiru baayyee hin qabnu.
What makes a good wife?.	Haadha manaa gaarii maaltu godha?.
I had no idea why that might be	Maaliif akkas taʼuu akka dandaʼu yaada hin qabu ture
You couldn’t have given it away.	Silaa kennuu hin dandeessu turte.
He looked at her again, over his hand.	Ammas ishee ilaale, harka isaa irra.
I hadn’t noticed it before	Kanaan dura hin hubanne ture
I can't make you what you once were	Akka ati yeroo tokko turte si gochuu hin danda'u
One of the best places.	Bakka hunda caalaa gaarii ta'e tokko.
I need more than that	Kana caalaa na barbaachisa
But now it was nothing.	Amma garuu homaa hin turre.
We should see more of him, shouldn’t we.	Isa caalaa arguu qabna, hin qabnu.
You shouldn’t give it to this person.	Nama kanaaf kennuu hin qabdu.
Some people like it.	Namoonni tokko tokko ni jaallatu.
He always knows what time it is.	Yeroo hunda sa'aatii meeqa akka ta'e ni beeka.
Glad to have you here!.	Asitti si argachuu kootti gammadeera!.
I should never have come here.	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture.
It's a good one.	Kan gaarii dha.
I think you are right.	Ati sirrii dha jedheen yaada.
I mean, look at me.	Na ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
I’m not a guy anymore.	Ani kana booda gurbaa miti.
I told him about this book.	Waa'ee kitaaba kanaa itti hime.
He could have left it there.	Silaa achitti dhiisuu danda'a ture.
I never said that.	Ani akkas jedhee hin beeku.
But this was not enough.	Kun garuu gahaa hin turre.
It had to be someone after.	Nama booda jiru ta'uu qaba ture.
I am where she is, sometimes.	Ani bakka isheen jirtu sana jira, yeroo tokko tokko.
It’s my house.	Mana kooti.
It still seemed important.	Ammas barbaachisaa fakkaata ture.
That was never his problem.	Rakkoon isaa sun gonkumaa hin turre.
They were with school children.	Ijoollee mana barumsaa waliin turan.
I wonder what they will be	Maal ta'u jedheen yaada
When he said it wasn’t entirely a question.	Yeroo isaan jedhe guutummaatti gaaffii miti.
I told him, too.	Anis itti hime.
All of this matters.	Kun hundi dhimma qaba.
I like the work.	Hojiin natti tola.
I knew all the answers	Deebii isaa hunda nan beeka ture
There were people on the road.	Karaa irra namoonni turan.
So I like it a lot	Kanaaf baay'ee natti tola
He had a pretty good idea of ​​how now.	Akkamitti akka ta'e amma yaada gaarii qaba ture.
He noticed something was different.	Waan tokko akka adda ta’e hubate.
Mine didn’t really look like the picture.	Kan koo dhuguma akka suuraa sanaa hin taane.
. . . .	.
Why did you say.	Maaliif jettee.
I still can't be human	Ammas nama ta'uu hin danda'u
I certainly knew him	Ani akkan isa beeku beekamaadha
I thought he knew better	Inni kana caalaa waan beeku natti fakkaate
But that's how it had to be.	Garuu akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
All but one.	Tokko malee hunda.
This is not about this week's issue.	Kun waa'ee dhimma torban kanaa miti.
This night was all about you, not about me.	Halkan kun waa'ee kee qofa ture malee waa'ee koo miti.
He seemed quite happy.	Inni baayʼee waan gammade fakkaata ture.
After a while.	Yeroo muraasa booda.
Maybe you didn't see me.	Tarii na hin argine ta'a.
I won't tell him what you said	Waan ati jette itti hin himu
About the house.	Waa'ee manaa.
Never have, never have.	Gonkumaa hin qabu, gonkumaa hin qabu.
It was the same every week.	Torban hunda akkuma ture.
I can help you out.	Si gargaaruu nan danda'a.
I think it's probably worse for him.	Isaaf kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada.
All now.	Hundi amma.
Maybe he wanted to.	Tarii barbaade ta'a.
He is no longer in himself	Kana booda of keessa hin jiru
The current one, obviously not.	Kan yeroo ammaa kana, akka hin taane ifaadha.
It was my mother’s name.	Maqaa haadha koo ture.
I used to teach, you know.	Duraan barsiisaa ture beekta.
He didn’t even know what he was doing, not really.	Waan hojjetu illee hin beeku ture, dhuguma miti.
Not after the fact.	Dhugaa jiru booda miti.
It was too long.	Garmalee dheeraa ture.
I absolutely love it here.	Asitti guutummaatti baay'een jaalladha.
So I don't need it.	Kanaaf na hin barbaachisu.
Now go back home.	Amma gara manaatti deebi'i.
I had no idea who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I didn’t need any votes right now	Yeroo ammaa kana sagalee tokkollee na hin barbaachifne
It was then that his career began.	Yeroo sanatti ture hojiin isaa kan jalqabe.
It has for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf qaba
I didn't know what it meant	Maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
There’s really no excuse.	Dhuguma sababni hin jiru.
You know nothing about these people's lives.	Waa'ee jireenya namoota kanaa homaa hin beektu.
Check it out and it should be fine.	Itti ilaalaa gaarii ta'uu qaba.
It's just an accident.	Balaa qofa.
But it didn't do much for you.	Garuu waan baay'ee siif hin goone.
You know, of course.	Beektaa, beekamaadha.
I’m definitely not in the mood.	Miira keessa akkan hin jirre beekamaadha.
Before all that little girl.	Intala xiqqoo sana hunda dura.
The one that's great.	Kan guddaa ta'e.
Many never did.	Baay'een isaanii gonkumaa hin goone.
I think this is a good thing	Kun waan gaarii natti fakkaata
But it wasn’t necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa hin turre.
Except this week.	Torban kana malee.
His mother's hand.	Harka haadha isaa.
That was good, but not enough for him.	Sun gaarii ture, garuu isaaf gahaa hin turre.
I know what’s at stake	Waan balaa irra jiru nan beeka
I need to go with you	Si waliin deemuun na barbaachisa
But not all of them.	Hundi isaanii garuu miti.
I wasn't really sure when	Yoom akka ta'e dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre
On the highway.	Karaa guddaa irratti.
I didn't need a car for hours.	Konkolaataa sa'aatii dheeraaf hin barbaachisu ture.
He could have done that well.	Gaarii kana gochuu dandaʼa ture.
I just thought about it, and it happened	Anis itti yaade qofa, ta'e
Now that, voice of.	Amma sana, sagalee of.
But it didn't go very well afterwards.	Garuu booda baayyee gaarii hin deemne.
It needs to be big.	Guddaa ta'uu barbaachisa.
He was there, he was there.	Inni achi ture, achi ture.
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I just don’t know who wants it	Eenyu akka barbaadu qofa hin beeku
But of course it can.	Garuu beekamaadha ni danda'a.
I’m just looking at you	Si qofa ilaalaa jira
He seemed happy to see me.	Na arguu isaatiin waan gammade fakkaata ture.
It was then.	Yeroo sana ture.
Then it won't happen.	Sana booda hin ta'u.
It just might be.	Ta'uu danda'a qofa.
But it was then.	Garuu yeroo sana ture.
My work keeps me on the road a lot.	Hojiin koo baay'ee karaa irra na qaba.
I didn’t really think anything of it	Dhuguma homaa itti hin yaadne
They have to give you something.	Waan tokko siif kennuu qabu.
It must be morning again.	Ammas ganama ta'uu qaba.
I wanted to be among them	Isaan keessaa ta'uu barbaade
They are everywhere.	Bakka hunda jiru.
You can fill it up there.	Achitti guutuu dandeessa.
It was never that bad again.	Amma booda hangas hamaa ta'ee hin beeku.
I'm looking for the real thing.	Waan dhugaa barbaadaa jira.
Until he.	Hanga inni.
She should have known.	Beekuu qabdi turte.
Just wait and see.	Eegaa qofa ilaalaa.
He thought it was good.	Gaarii itti fakkaate.
I used to have the same problem	Duraan rakkoon wal fakkaatu qaba ture
I didn’t really see anything wrong with it	Dhuguma waan dogoggora qabu tokkollee hin argine
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
A lot of things can happen	Wanti baay'een ta'uu danda'a
In the long run.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti.
But it certainly wasn’t.	Garuu akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I don’t want them.	Ani isaan hin barbaadu.
I was looking right into his eyes	Anis sirriitti ija isaa keessa ilaalaa ture
That thing was huge.	Wanti sun guddaa ture.
He had a wicked sense of humor	Miira qoosaa hamaa qaba ture
I just can't leave her there alone	Kophaa ishee achitti dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u
You’re a problem.	Ati rakkoo.
I am no exception.	Anis kanaan ala miti.
This works well, really, really well.	Kun akka gaariitti hojjeta, dhuguma, dhuguma akka gaariitti.
So I was so excited.	Kanaaf akkasitti gammade.
He gave it to me without question.	Gaaffii tokko malee naaf kenne.
I just didn’t have it.	Ani qofa hin qabu ture.
Who knows what’s out there.	Waan ala jiru eenyutu beeka.
It was the perfect name.	Maqaa guutuu ture.
And I wasn't any good at it	Anis kana irratti ga'umsa tokkollee hin qabu ture
I hadn’t thought of that	Ani akkas jedhee hin yaadne ture
He was a great dog.	Inni saree guddaa ture.
I wanted to tell you that	Sana sitti himuu barbaade
She is only three months old.	Umuriin ishee ji'a sadii qofa.
He thought of his mother and father.	Haadha isaa fi abbaa isaa yaade.
He's a good one.	Inni gaarii dha.
I knew who she really was	Dhuguma eenyu akka taate nan beeka ture
It's just like that.	Akkasitti qofa.
I had no idea about it	Waa'ee kanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
As such things always do, it passed.	Akkuma wanti akkasii yeroo hunda godhu, darbe.
Otherwise, it will be the same as before.	Yoo kana hin taane akkuma duraan ta'e ta'a.
I love him very much	Baay'een isa jaalladha
I think it should be obvious	Ifa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
Something was definitely not right.	Wanti tokko sirrii akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I couldn’t see why he couldn’t stay longer	Maaliif kana caalaa turuu akka hin dandeenye arguu hin dandeenye
But it doesn’t quite work.	Garuu guutummaatti hin hojjetu.
This was all a long time ago.	Kun hundi yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
But it’s not me.	Garuu ana miti.
I didn’t know any of them well	Isaan keessaa tokkollee akka gaariitti hin beeku ture
I don't know how much.	Meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku.
I just didn’t care enough	Ani garuu dhimma gahaa hin qabu ture
Everything was great.	Wanti hundi guddaa ture.
I'm pretty good at it.	Ani baay'ee gaarii dha.
Hopefully it will be soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti akka ta'u abdii qabna.
I just have no idea.	Yaada hin qabu qofa.
A little longer.	Xiqqoo dheeraa ta'e.
Like this one.	Akka isa kanaa.
It was right.	Sirrii ture.
You don’t do it in your daily routine.	Hojii guyyaa guyyaa kee keessatti hin gootu.
It was such a night.	Halkan akkasii ture.
I love how he is treating me	Akkamitti akka inni na ilaalaa jiru baay'een jaalladha
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
I hope that is clear.	Sun ifa akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
But this is not the serious issue at hand.	Garuu dhimma hamaa harka jiru kana miti.
Other.	Kan biraa.
Things could go wrong.	Wanti dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼa.
It was a great day.	Guyyaa guddaa ture.
I was waiting for this moment	Yeroo kana eegaa ture
I wanted to ask him something	Waan tokko isa gaafachuu barbaade
He wants you and no one else	Si barbaada malee nama biraa hin barbaadu
But she didn't know what to do.	Isheen garuu maal akka gootu hin beektu turte.
I have to go now	Amma deemuun qaba
He should have just given up	Silaa harka kennuu qofa qaba ture
I think to some extent	Hamma tokko jedheen yaada
There is no one here.	Namni as hin jiru.
I looked her in the eye.	Anis ija keessa ishee ilaale.
If he tells me what to do, I doubt it.	Waan godhu yoo natti hime nan shakka.
I love children.	Ijoollee nan jaalladha.
I know him really well	Dhuguma sirriitti isa beeka
I think of you very much	Baay'een siif yaada
I was a threesome.	Ani nama sadii ture.
But, it happened.	Garuu, ta'e.
I think she just did what she could	Waan dandeessu qofa goote jedheen yaada
He certainly wanted to.	Inni akka barbaade beekamaadha.
I know it’s not something you like	Waan ati jaallattu akka hin taane nan beeka
He knew he could.	Akka danda'u beeka ture.
I wouldn’t have come to it.	Silaa itti hin dhufu ture.
His work is much better known than his life.	Hojiin isaa jireenya isaa caalaa baayyee beekamaadha.
They would be here.	Silaa as jiru.
He wants to know.	Inni beekuu ni barbaada.
Seems like a good reason.	Sababa gaarii fakkaatu.
He wanted to stay in that place	Bakka sanatti turuu barbaade
I mean, it was light	Ifa ture jechuu kooti
He shouldn't have done it	Silaa gochuu hin qabu ture
They tell you what's good.	Waan gaarii ta'e sitti himu.
I looked around in the small space	Bakka xiqqoo sana keessa naannoo koo ilaale
This one is dangerous.	Inni kun balaa qaba.
I think that’s a good idea	Sun yaada gaarii natti fakkaata
Just tell the truth.	Dhugaa dubbachuu qofa.
There was no one in the room.	Kutaa sana keessa namni tokkollee hin turre.
I can give you a good time	Yeroo gaarii siif kennuu nan danda'a
But what does he know.	Garuu maal beeka.
But I have to go.	Ani garuu deemuun qaba.
I can't be around these people right now	Yeroo ammaa kana naannoo namoota kanaa jiraachuu hin danda'u
I know you were with him	Isa waliin akka turte nan beeka
He talks about his teacher all the time.	Waa'ee barsiisaa isaa yeroo hunda ni dubbata.
But this time.	Garuu yeroo kana.
Then she did that.	Sana booda akkas goote.
I really don't want to talk about it	Dhuguma waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu
You don’t just want to make money.	Maallaqa qofa argachuu hin barbaaddu.
Over time, I mean myself	Yeroo booda ofii koo jechuu kooti
We had it in the room with my dad.	Abbaa koo waliin kutaa sana keessatti qabna turre.
You don't know him.	Ati isa hin beektu.
I mean everything.	Waan hundumaa jechuu kooti.
That couldn't have happened.	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
But that couldn’t happen.	Garuu sun ta’uu hin dandeenye.
This one works, this one doesn’t.	Inni kun ni hojjeta, inni kun hin hojjetu.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
I just didn't really know what it was	Maal akka ta'e qofa sirriitti hin beeku ture
A long week.	Torban dheeraa.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Garuu wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
I think that’s important	Sun barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
I mean, you were great.	Ati guddaa turte jechuu kooti.
I told him something	Anis waan tokko itti hime
I think of myself the whole time	Yeroo guutuu ofitti yaada
People know it’s not.	Namoonni akka hin taane ni beeku.
He was more like a man than a boy.	Inni gurbaa caalaa nama fakkaata ture.
I haven’t done it yet, not quite	Ammallee hin goone, guutummaatti miti
They’re just not quite yours.	Isaan guutummaatti kan kee miti qofa.
It’s very dangerous.	Baayyee balaa qaba.
I knew all about you	Waa'ee kee hunda nan beeka ture
You are a good guy.	Ati gurbaa gaarii dha.
This is us.	Kun nuti.
So even we.	Kanaaf nuti illee.
But I knew who she was	Ani garuu eenyu akka taate nan beeka ture
Nothing else is happening.	Wanti biraa ta'aa jiru hin jiru.
He is not such a person.	Inni nama akkasii miti.
There is no reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni hin jiru.
I am not a human being.	Ani nama miti.
He didn't seem to think it was too bad.	Baayyee hamaa waan itti fakkaate hin fakkaatu.
She had enough to think about right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana waan itti yaaddu gahaa qabdi turte.
You didn’t do that.	Ati akkas hin goone.
It is dangerous in this way.	Haala kanaan balaa qaba.
I couldn't be that person anymore	Kana booda nama sana ta'uu hin danda'u ture
I didn’t see that coming	Sun dhufuu isaa hin argine
Hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
I’m not just myself anymore	Kana booda ani ofii koo qofa miti
Maybe they'll get lucky.	Tarii carraa argachuu danda'u.
As he is.	Akkuma inni.
I just didn’t want to	Ani qofa hin barbaanne
The problem was with your daughter.	Rakkoon intala kee waliin ture.
I hope someone knows what to do	Namni maal akka godhu akka beeku abdiin qaba
A special time.	Yeroo adda ta'e.
I had never been in such a nice house before	Kanaan dura mana tola akkasii keessa hin turre
They have nothing.	Isaan homaa hin qaban.
It was gone in an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko keessatti deeme.
Maybe that's how this is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a kun.
But everyone went away.	Hundi garuu deeme.
Everything was going to be different after this night.	Halkan kana booda wanti hundi adda ta'uuf ture.
Of course, this is not always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It’s time for me to go.	Yeroon ani deemu amma.
It’s not your business.	Dhimma kee miti.
I hope it works again.	Ammas akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
He is still there.	Ammas achi jira.
I'm so excited!.	Baay'een gammadeera!.
We need to do this.	Kana gochuu qabna.
You wouldn’t want to do that.	Ati akkas gochuu hin barbaaddu turte.
I have a lot of money on this man	Nama kana irratti qarshii baay'ee qaba
I know you are willing to do this	Kana gochuuf fedhii akka qabdu nan beeka
It’s dangerous.	Balaa qaba.
The one that was there, I think was after us	Kan achi ture, nu booda ture jedheen yaada
He loved his mother.	Haadha isaa ni jaallata ture.
Yours was great.	Kan keessan guddaa ture.
I was alone and in my house	Kophaa koo fi mana koo keessa ture
We shouldn't be, but we are.	Ta'uu hin qabnu, garuu jirra.
You really didn’t belong there.	Dhuguma ati kan achi hin turre.
It took a good while.	Yeroo gaarii fudhate.
It was right.	Sirrii ture.
Then this opportunity came along.	Sana booda carraan kun dhufe.
We had another situation, some time ago.	Haala biraa qabna turre, yeroo muraasa dura.
That you don’t want them there	Achitti akka isaan hin barbaanne
I really want a new pair	Lamaan haaraa baay'een barbaada
It’s a great amount	Hamma guddaa ta’e
It may not even be good.	Gaarii illee ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
It was his mistake.	Dogoggora isaa ture.
This may be a necessary time but it is not enough.	Yeroon kun yeroo barbaachisaa ta'uu danda'a garuu gahaa miti.
I wouldn’t go with him	Ani isa waliin hin deemu ture
I couldn’t give him any.	Tokkollee isaaf kennuu hin dandeenye.
Now I don't understand anything.	Amma waan tokkollee hin hubanne.
I don’t know these people	Namoota kana hin beeku
I had no idea where she was going	Eessa akka deemtu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
Not very clear though.	Baayyee ifa miti garuu.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Kana booda gochuu hin dandeenye.
He obviously won’t tell you everything.	Waan hunda akka sitti hin himne ifaadha.
They still have no idea.	Ammas yaada hin qaban.
We don’t need it though.	Nu hin barbaachisu garuu.
I can't be in the same room	Kutaa tokko keessa ta'uu hin danda'u
This seemed like a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii fakkaata ture.
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
I just don't understand why	Maaliif akka ta'e qofa naaf hin galle
I doubt we can survive long	Yeroo dheeraa jiraachuu akka dandeenyu nan shakka
The waiting period passed.	Yeroon eegaa darbe.
Now that’s one thing.	Amma sun waan tokko.
I like him a little more.	Xiqqoo caalaa isa jaalladha.
But there’s really no right or wrong.	Garuu dhuguma sirrii fi dogoggora hin jiru.
I wonder why I haven’t seen any	Maaliif tokkollee hin argine jedheen yaada
Things we shouldn't talk about.	Wantoota waa'ee isaanii dubbachuu hin qabne.
Even more than that.	Sana illee caalaa.
Hope this helps you out.	Kun akka si gargaaru abdii qabna.
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
Therefore, she should have received nothing more.	Kanaaf, kana caalaa homaa argachuu hin qabdu turte.
You're right about that.	Waa'ee kanaa sirrii dha.
This is not a chance.	Kun carraa miti.
It’s just not right.	Sirrii miti qofa.
He was very large.	Inni baayyee guddaa ture.
I think that’s there.	Sun waan jiru natti fakkaata.
He had a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa qaba ture.
I can't see him, not yet	Isa arguu hin danda'u, ammallee miti
But of course he knew me well.	Garuu beekamaadha inni akka gaariitti naaf beeka ture.
Until several weeks later.	Hanga torban hedduu booda.
Very good!.	Baayyee gaarii dha!.
Something was wrong, very wrong.	Wanti tokko dogoggora ture, baayyee dogoggora ture.
He saw what he wanted.	Waan inni barbaadu arge.
Tell me what’s real, and what’s not.	Maal dhugaa, maal akka hin taane natti himi.
You don't have very long.	Baayyee dheeraa hin qabdu.
You can help me out.	Na gargaaruu dandeessu.
You haven’t seen him, you can’t.	Isa hin argine, hin dandeessu.
Nothing much matters after that, not really.	Sana booda wanti baay'ee barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru, dhuguma miti.
We shouldn’t have too much trouble though.	Rakkoo guddaa qabaachuu hin qabnu garuu.
Sometimes, it still is.	Yeroo tokko tokko, amma iyyuu akkas taʼa.
I couldn't do that to him	Kana isa gochuu hin dandeenye
Late to the interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii irratti yeroon booda.
He said he had to eat.	Nyaachuu akka qabu dubbateera.
He had two children.	Ijoollee lama qaba ture.
It would be a great thing.	Waan guddaa ta'a.
I didn’t have to do the work	Ani hojii sana gochuu hin qabu ture
That's not going to happen.	Sun hin ta'u.
I couldn’t find any of mine	Kan koo tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
This is probably not the case.	Kun akkas ta’uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
I only have a couple of days before they return	Isaan deebi'uu isaanii dura guyyaa lama lama qofa qaba
I knew nothing about them.	Waa'ee isaanii homaa hin beeku ture.
I would never intend to do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuuf hin yaadu ture
Now I know what to do.	Amma maal akkan godhu beeka.
At the time, I did not care about either	Yeroo sanatti waaʼee lamaan isaanii iyyuu dhimma hin qabu ture
I didn’t realize he was there	Achi akka jiru hin hubanne
I had been waiting for him for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf isa eegaa ture
Something that doesn't have time.	Waan yeroo hin qabne.
We are interested.	Fedhii qabna.
I know it shouldn't be, but it had	Ta'uu akka hin qabne nan beeka, garuu ni qaba ture
But now she did.	Amma garuu akkas goote.
You can see what is happening here.	Waan ta'aa jiru as irraa arguu dandeessu.
I wasn't sure about that	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
He wasn’t there for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi hin turre.
I was really happy with how it turned out	Akkamitti akka ta'e baay'een gammade
I had it, for your sake	Ani qaba ture, siif jedhee
But still nothing.	Garuu ammas homaa hin jiru.
I don’t know how to say this.	Kana akkamitti akkan jedhu hin beeku.
I wanted to know everything about him	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa beekuu barbaade
I don’t know what he saw in her	Waan inni ishee keessatti arge hin beeku
I was just another guy	Ani gurbaa biraa qofa ture
I never knew that was happening	Sun ta'aa akka jiru tasumaa hin beeku ture
This is your truth.	Kun dhugaa keessan.
He is nowhere to be found.	Inni bakka hin jiru.
I could never go back to it	Gonkumaa itti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
But you are one.	Ati garuu tokko.
They want something but.	Waan tokko tokko malee barbaadu.
But that wasn’t even the worst.	Garuu sun isa hamaa illee hin turre.
I’m here for you now	Amma siif as jira
I was no better than them	Ani isaan caalaa hin turre
Everything turned out fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee ba'e.
I went there, too.	Anis achi deeme.
I wouldn't have known much about that	Silaa waa'ee sanaa waan baay'ee hin beeku ture
In this case, there is no chance.	Haala kanaan carraan hin jiru.
I don’t think it’s our dog.	Saree keenya natti hin fakkaatu.
I looked around sharply	Anis akka malee naannoo koo ilaale
Maybe someone was there.	Tarii namni tokko achi ture ta'a.
It was quick.	Dafee ture.
We didn’t see what we knew we saw.	Waan argine beekne hin argine.
He cares about you so much.	Inni baay'ee sitti yaada.
I know when something is going to happen	Wanti tokko yoom akka ta'u nan beeka
It’s not a chance.	Carraa miti.
Sorry, it took me a while	Dhiifama, xiqqoo natti fudhate
I mean, unless she is	Yoo isheen hin taane malee jechuu kooti
I should never have come here	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture
No one overstated it.	Namni garmalee dubbate hin jiru.
I really wanted to see what you had	Waan ati qabdu arguu baay'een barbaade
I know you are always good at your job	Yeroo hundumaa hojii kee irratti akka gaarii taate nan beeka
This was going to work.	Kun hojjechuuf ture.
I have no idea what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I think this will happen.	Kun ta'a jedheen yaada.
I’m glad I spoke to him	Itti dubbachuu kootti gammadeera
I won't come with you	Si waliin hin dhufu
That would be good enough.	Sun gaarii gahaa ta'a.
Every two days of the week.	Torban keessaa guyyaa lama hunda.
I thought it was just one night	Halkan tokko qofa waan ta'e natti fakkaate
It's always 'in'.	Yeroo hunda 'keessa' jira.
I know someone who works with them	Nama isaan waliin hojjetu nan beeka
I already know what is happening	Waan ta'aa jiru duruu beeka
I know this very well	Dhimma kana sirriitti beeka
I didn't want to have to do this	Kana gochuun dirqama ta'uu hin barbaanne
Sometimes he has a sense of humor	Yeroo tokko tokko miira qoosaa qaba
That was where he was a dog.	Bakka inni saree ture sana ture.
But that doesn’t mean it’s not there.	Garuu achi hin jiru jechuu miti.
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
I just can't leave her there.	Achitti ishee dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u.
That's happening a lot.	Sun waan baay'ee ta'aa jira.
Good people there.	Namoota gaarii achitti.
I know how it is true.	Akkamitti dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka.
I now know who you mean	Eenyu jechuu akka barbaaddu amma beeka
Three out of three.	Sadii keessaa sadii.
I still want to do all those things	Ammallee wantoota sana hunda hojjechuu nan barbaada
I wondered if he was in car trouble	Rakkoo konkolaataa keessa jiraa jedheen yaade
This was the time.	Yeroon kun ture.
He wanted to eat one.	Tokko nyaachuu barbaade.
I wasn’t in it at all yesterday	Kaleessa tasumaa keessa hin turre
I couldn’t live without you	Si malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I know nothing about them	Waa'ee isaanii homaa hin beeku
Then he looked at us.	Sana booda nu ilaale.
That's enough for me	Kana naaf gahaa jira
They do a job all the time.	Hojii yeroo hunda hojjetu.
I don't want to be anything.	Ani homaa ta'uu hin barbaadu.
A new school.	Mana barumsaa haaraa.
A room in your own home.	Kutaa mana ofii keessa jiru.
I already know it won’t	Akka hin taane duruu beeka
We worked very well together that day.	Guyyaa sana baayyee gaarii waliin hojjenne.
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
Nobody ever goes away.	Namni gonkumaa hin deemu.
I knew what was happening	Waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka ture
I couldn’t speak anymore	Kana booda dubbachuu hin dandeenye
He’s not like that, at all.	Inni akkas miti, tasumaa.
He didn’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabu ture.
They were all on food food.	Hundi isaanii nyaata nyaata irra turan.
I mean, just look at that dress	Uffata sana qofa ilaalaa jechuu kooti
I think that’s dangerous	Sun balaa qaba jedheen yaada
He didn’t have that many clothes with him	Uffata hamma kanaa of biraa hin qabu ture
Good with kids.	Ijoollee wajjin gaarii dha.
I had no idea what was going on here.	Asitti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I didn’t have a week	Torban tokko hin qabu ture
You can see they have this very badly.	Kana baayyee hamaa akka qaban arguu dandeessu.
I didn't want to talk about that	Waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne
I wondered where exactly he was at that moment	Yeroo sanatti sirriitti eessa jira jedheen yaade
Truth as he saw it.	Dhugaa akkuma arge.
I’m not telling you any of that	Ani waan akkasii tokkollee sitti hin himu
I have to help him.	Ani isa gargaaruu qaba.
But this time was different.	Yeroon kun garuu adda ture.
Tell me you still love me.	Ammallee akka na jaallattu natti himi.
If people don’t have money, we have to help someone.	Yoo namoonni qarshii hin qabne nama gargaaruu qabna.
It looked bad.	Hamaa fakkaata ture.
What we were looking for.	Waan barbaadaa turre.
No one noticed she was gone.	Namni tokkollee akka isheen hin jirre hubate hin jiru.
I can't tell you everything	Waan hundumaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
It was only once, wasn't it.	Yeroo tokko qofa ture mitii.
We all have that he has an opinion	Hundi keenya yaada akka qabu qabna
I never would have thought it would have been possible	Silaa gonkumaa ni danda'ama jedhee hin yaadu ture
But only for a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
There should be no desire anymore	Kana booda fedhii jiraachuu hin qabu
I thought they were completely human.	Isaan guutummaatti nama natti fakkaate.
Glad to see him	Isa arguu kootti gammadeera
I think he should get a teaching job.	Hojii barsiisaa argachuu qaba jedheen yaada.
I know that he is very good	Baayyee gaarii akka taʼe nan beeka
He wants to eat people here	Asitti nama nyaachuu barbaada
I wanted to be with them.	Isaan waliin ta'uu barbaade.
But this is indeed possible.	Garuu kun dhuguma ni danda’ama.
I don't quite know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'u guutummaatti hin beeku.
I want to stay here.	As turuu barbaada.
He did that with you today	Har'a si waliin akkas godhe
I know better than not	Ani osoo hin taane caalaa beeka
I don't have a picture.	Suuraa hin qabu.
But it’s not your daughter.	Garuu intala kee miti.
He knew it was true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa ni beeka ture.
Probably, he said.	Tarii ta'uu hin oolu jedhe.
All that kind of stuff.	Waan akkasii hunda.
I would have done whatever she said	Silaa waan isheen jette hunda nan godha ture
It had their names, everything	Maqaa isaanii qaba ture, waan hundumaa
I know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka.
Some of this stuff is really, really good.	Wanti kun tokko tokko dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii dha.
I know you think so	Akkas akka yaaddu nan beeka
I don't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
I have been here several times	Yeroo hedduu as tureera
I knew he wouldn’t be here long	Yeroo dheeraaf as akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
But you have to be good.	Garuu gaarii ta'uu qabda.
Then we did that.	Sana booda akkas goone.
I think her father's	Kan abbaa ishee natti fakkaata
You have to be different.	Adda ta'uu qabda.
What is the problem?.	Rakkoon jiru maali?.
You can live without it.	Isa malee jiraachuu dandeessa.
That he couldn't do it.	Akka gochuu hin dandeenye.
I wondered if anyone was still there	Ammas namni achi jiru jiraa jedheen yaade
It could have been a good book.	Kitaaba gaarii ta'uu danda'a ture.
I still think this is true.	Ammallee kun dhugaa natti fakkaata.
She understood nothing about herself.	Waa'ee ofii ishee homaa hin hubanne.
We all have one.	Hundi keenya tokko qabna.
But two years later, things look different.	Garuu waggaa lama booda wanti jiru adda fakkaata.
I didn’t even know myself anymore	Kana booda of illee hin beeku ture
I didn’t do it.	Ani hin hojjenne.
I want to know what's important to you.	Waan siif barbaachisaa ta'e beekuu barbaada.
I meant I didn’t understand	Hin hubanne jechuu barbaade
He wouldn't have gone.	Silaa hin deemu ture.
I could have no idea about my career	Waa'ee hojii koo yaada tokkollee qabaachuu hin danda'u ture
I made it happen.	Ani akka ta'u godhe.
Time for me to go.	Yeroon ani itti deemu.
There was no turning back from one.	Tokko irraa deebi'uu hin turre.
Probably with reason.	Sababa waliin ta'uu hin oolu.
We are here, in the now, in the present moment.	Nuti as jirra, amma keessa, yeroo ammaa keessa.
I really don’t understand	Dhuguma naaf hin galle
It just needed some time for me	Yeroo muraasa qofa naaf barbaade
Luck didn't know what to do.	Carraan maal akka godhu hin beekne.
I love her so much.	Baay'een ishee jaalladha.
Not this girl.	Intala kana miti.
I don’t know what to do with it.	Maal akka itti godhu hin beeku.
There is no need to do this.	Kana gochuun hin barbaachisu.
But they still have a very big mistake.	Garuu ammallee dogoggora baayyee guddaa qabu.
I sit with these people	Namoota kana waliin taa'a
A wife who loves him	Haadha manaa isa jaallattu
We won’t do it for you.	Siif hin goonu.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Kana booda waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
I go all day without a good meal	Guyyaa guutuu nyaata gaarii malee nan deema
I went through it with my own kids.	Ijoollee ofii koo waliin keessa darbe.
I love our life here	Jireenya keenya asitti baay'een jaalladha
It doesn’t mean it didn’t work.	Hin hojjenne jechuu miti.
I know exactly what to do to help you	Si gargaaruuf maal akkan godhu sirriitti beeka
I couldn’t help any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
He really seems to know everyone.	Dhuguma nama hunda waan beeku fakkaata.
Without Him, it is nothing.	Isa malee homaa miti.
It doesn’t matter what came first.	Maaltu duraan dhufe homaa hin qabu.
Longer than usual	Yeroo biraa caalaa yeroo dheeraa
I thought the whole thing was a joke	Wanti hundi qoosaa natti fakkaate
Even the girl.	Intala illee.
But that doesn't mean much.	Garuu sun waan baay'ee jechuu miti.
I didn’t want to meet any of these people	Namoota kana keessaa tokkollee wal arguu hin barbaanne
That’s not what we have.	Kan nuti qabnu kanuma miti.
She was in it.	Isheen keessa turte.
I just didn't know what would happen	Maal akka ta'u qofa hin beeku ture
She was like that most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee akkas turte.
They even make you sleep better.	Hirriba gaarii illee si godhu.
I could ask him about it	Waaʼee kanaa isa gaafachuu nan dandaʼa ture
I hope it works out well	Akka gaariitti akka hojjetu abdiin qaba
It should have been.	Silaa ta'uu qaba ture.
I shouldn't have said it.	Silaa jechuu hin qabu ture.
You can in a year.	Waggaa tokko booda ni dandeessu.
You can just see it.	Arguu qofa dandeessu.
There was no one else in the vicinity but himself.	Naannoo sana keessa ofii isaa malee namni biraa hin turre.
He was pleased with himself.	Ofitti gammade.
No matter what, we still have time.	Homaa hin taane ammallee yeroo qabna.
I just can't do it anymore	Kana booda gochuu qofa hin danda'u
I think that’s a good thing	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaata
He looked her in the eye	Ija keessa ishee ilaale
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
It would have really been something.	Silaa dhuguma waan tokko ta'a ture.
It's working now.	Amma hojjechaa jira.
I love you so much	Baay'een si jaalladha
I like it very much	Baayyee natti tola
He wanted to come.	Inni dhufuu barbaade.
She couldn't be right, he thought.	Isheen sirrii ta'uu hin dandeessu jedhee yaade.
But then it doesn't.	Garuu sana booda hin ta'u.
You're a lot like him.	Ati baay'ee isa fakkaata.
He looked at his watch.	Sa'aatii isaa ilaale.
He had this stuff in life.	Jireenya keessatti waan kanaa qaba ture.
Except that it rarely works.	Yeroo muraasaaf akka hojjetu malee.
Maybe it's your daughter.	Tarii intala kee ta'uu danda'a.
It was good for him.	Isaaf gaarii ture.
I don't know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku.
I can't see why she would love someone like her	Nama akka ishee maaliif akka jaallattu arguu hin danda'u
That afternoon.	Guyyaa sana waaree booda.
It’s nothing but a question, a question.	Gaaffii, gaaffii malee homaa miti.
There was something different about them.	Waa'ee isaanii wanti adda ta'e tokko ture.
I still couldn't turn back, it was that clear.	Ammallee duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye, hangas ifa ture.
Who knows, he might even ask for your help.	Eenyutu beeka gargaarsa kee illee gaafachuu danda'a.
I said sorry many times	Yeroo baay'ee dhiifama jedheen ture
I am on them.	Ani isaan irra jira.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
It's never been like that with you!	Si waliin akkas ta'ee hin beeku!
That is.	Sun ...dha.
It should help with that	Sana gargaaruu qaba
Like everyone else does, really.	Akkuma namni hundi godhu, dhuguma.
I'm sure everything will be fine	Wanti hundi gaarii akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha
But people come there.	Garuu namoonni achi dhufu.
I need someone there	Nama achi jiru na barbaachisa
I told him everything	Waan hundumaa itti hime
More than good.	Gaarii caalaa.
I wanted that life and nothing else.	Jireenya sana barbaadu malee kan biraa hin barbaadu ture.
Now it seems none of them want the job.	Amma isaan keessaa tokkollee hojii sana waan hin barbaanne fakkaata.
Almost no one has done that.	Namni akkas godhe hin jiru jechuun ni danda’ama.
One of us always goes, you know.	Tokko keenya yeroo hunda ni deema, beekta.
It’s not really you.	Dhuguma si miti.
But it’s nice.	Garuu namatti tola.
I think maybe you should be with him	Tarii isa waliin ta'uu qabdu jedheen yaada
There's one every two hours.	Sa'aatii lama keessatti tokko jira.
I don't have a father now	Ani amma abbaa hin qabu
I didn't want to talk about my father	Waa'ee abbaa koo dubbachuu hin barbaanne
I have been both.	Ani lamaan isaaniiyyuu ta'ee jira.
It was nothing to him.	Isaaf homaa hin turre.
It wasn't going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin turre.
We’re on it.	Nuti irra jirra.
He wants her badly right now	Yeroo ammaa kana akka malee ishee barbaada
More than anything, she needed food.	Waan hundumaa caalaa nyaata ishee barbaachisa ture.
Maybe you're over that.	Tarii ati sanaa ol jirta ta'a.
I knew it looked really good here.	Asitti dhuguma gaarii akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture.
Maybe he has it.	Tarii qabaachuu danda'a.
He had no chance.	Carraa hin qabu ture.
He wants to live.	Jiraachuu barbaada.
He will do everything for you	Waan hundumaa siif godha
Sounds very similar.	Sagalee baayyee wal fakkaata.
That was none of his business.	Sun dhimma isaa tokkollee hin turre.
That's how it goes.	Akkasitti deema.
He had to find them sooner.	Dafee isaan argachuu qaba ture.
I never realized it was that bad	Hamma kana hamaa akka ta'e gonkumaa hin hubanne
It really was the good old days.	Dhuguma bara gaarii durii ture.
If you don't agree with me, tell me!.	Yoo natti walii hin galle natti himi!.
He certainly makes you think.	Inni akka yaaddu akka si godhu beekamaadha.
You have to find him.	Isa argachuu qabda.
I can't believe he would do this	Kana godha jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
It could be what happens later	Wanti booda ta'u ta'uu danda'a
He had all these feelings	Miira kana hunda qaba ture
He was in it.	Inni keessa ture.
I wondered what he thought about it	Waa'ee kanaa maal yaada jedheen yaade
It worked very well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjete.
He had three that year.	Waggaa sana sadii qaba ture.
It's my own.	Ofii kooti.
He pretty much knows who he is.	Eenyu akka ta'e baay'ee beeka.
I have no problem with people who disagree with me.	Namoota na waliin walii hin galle waliin rakkoo hin qabu.
Need to buy a lot more.	Kana caalaa baay'ee bitachuu barbaachisa.
But she could not speak.	Isheen garuu dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t even think about that	Sana illee hin yaadne
He is working there.	Achitti hojjechaa jira.
It just doesn’t exist.	Hin jiru qofa.
I don’t think it matters.	Dhimma waan qabu natti hin fakkaatu.
I was sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa ture.
I didn’t see them later	Booda isaan hin argine
I didn't really think much of it at the time	Yeroo sanatti dhuguma baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I didn’t know how to help him	Akkamitti akkan isa gargaaru hin beeku ture
I didn't know what had happened	Waan ta'e hin beeku ture
But right now you are.	Garuu yeroo ammaa kana ati.
But it wasn’t entirely true.	Garuu guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre.
It wasn’t his house.	Mana isaa hin turre.
Now it's good.	Amma gaarii dha.
She looks a lot like me.	Isheen baay'ee na fakkaata.
She seems to have the answer.	Deebii waan qabdu fakkaata.
I hope nothing went wrong	Wanti dogoggora ta'e akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
But it does work.	Garuu ni hojjeta.
It wasn’t that important.	Hangas barbaachisaa hin turre.
They have someone else here.	Asitti nama biraa qabu.
Now I can do something to help	Amma waan gargaaru gochuu nan danda'a
But not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf garuu miti.
She doesn’t love me.	Isheen na hin jaallattu.
He would have needed it.	Silaa isa barbaachisa ture.
I can feel in you	Si keessatti miira qabaachuu nan danda'a
I could be wrong about those.	Waa'ee warra sanaa dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
I want to help you figure out who did it	Eenyu akka godhe akka beektu si gargaaruu barbaada
I knew your father a long time ago	Abbaa kee yeroo dheeraa dura beeka ture
It wasn’t there at the time	Yeroo sanatti hin turre
He loves her.	Ishee ni jaallata.
Maybe this is an opportunity.	Tarii kun carraa ta'uu danda'a.
I never said that	Ani akkas jedhee hin beeku
Sometimes it happens at the bar.	Yeroo tokko tokko mana dhugaatii irratti ta'a.
They love it up there.	Achitti ol ni jaallatu.
I shouldn’t have gone with a girl	Silaa intala tokko waliin deemuu hin qabu ture
I wasn’t even here.	Ani as illee hin turre.
Again, that is my answer.	Ammas deebii koo kanuma.
They have children.	Ijoollee qabu.
He knew how it worked.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu beeka ture.
Maybe he told her to go home.	Tarii gara manaatti deebi'uu itti hime ta'a.
It is not even all that dangerous.	Hanga kana hunda illee balaa hin qabu.
It was nothing more than that.	Kana caalaa homaa hin turre.
I think it would be a good help	Gargaarsa gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
It should work for you.	Siif hojjechuu qaba.
It’s not a sound here.	Asitti sagalee miti.
That is often the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas taʼa.
I want this with you	Kana isin waliin barbaada
It wasn’t working, of course.	Hojjechaa hin turre, beekamaadha.
Something must be wrong.	Waan tokko dogoggora ta'uu qaba.
I knew it wasn’t going away	Akka hin deemne nan beeka ture
It's never happened before.	Kanaan dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
Which wasn’t.	Kan hin turre.
His job was simple.	Hojiin isaa salphaa ture.
I know this isn’t always easy.	Kun yeroo hunda salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
They may not even know you are here.	As akka jirtu illee beekuu dhiisuu danda'u.
I don’t want that either, not with you, you’re different.	Anis sana hin barbaadu, si waliin miti, ati adda.
It wasn’t in your place.	Bakka keessan hin turre.
I still think that’s true	Ammallee sun dhugaa natti fakkaata
I used to tell myself.	Duraan ofitti jedheen ture.
I didn’t know what to do with myself.	Waan ofitti godhu hin beeku ture.
Once it was nothing.	Yeroo tokko homaa hin turre.
But now wait.	Amma garuu eegaa.
I think that's always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'a jedheen yaada.
I have absolutely no idea what he said	Waan inni jedhe tasumaa yaada hin qabu
It seemed so easy.	Baayyee salphaa fakkaata ture.
Nothing bad has happened yet.	Waan hamaa hanga ammaatti hin taane.
A really great dog.	Saree dhuguma guddaa.
I mean a new life for us	Jireenya haaraa nuuf jechuu kooti
But he was a man.	Garuu nama ture.
I told him it was unnecessary	Anis akka hin barbaachifne itti hime
He was getting good at this	Kana irratti gaarii ta'aa ture
But he didn’t do this.	Garuu kana hin goone.
He's good at what he does.	Waan hojjetu irratti ga'umsa qaba.
But that is not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas miti.
Everyone thinks that.	Namni hundi akkas jedhee yaada.
He wanted to meet her	Ishee waliin wal arguu barbaade
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
It all works out.	Hundi isaa ni hojjeta.
No one could find him.	Namni isa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I love helping people	Namoota gargaaruu nan jaalladha
I thought maybe you knew	Tarii beektu jedheen yaade
Not like this, not anymore.	Akkasitti miti, kana booda miti.
This is working fine.	Kun gaarii hojjechaa jira.
But his work was an important one.	Garuu hojiin isaa hojii barbaachisaa ture.
I’m watching the dog	Ani saree ilaalaa jira
Something was really wrong.	Dhuguma wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
I know he loves me.	Akka na jaallatu nan beeka.
I’m not here to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf as hin jiru.
You will really love it.	Dhuguma ni jaallattu.
It's too good to be true.	Garmalee gaarii dha.
Tell him that.	Akkas itti himi.
But it happened.	Garuu ni ta'e.
I'll be fine.	Ani gaarii ta'a.
I know you very well	Ani akka gaariitti si beeka
It’s a job.	Hojii dha.
But if he did, it didn’t matter.	Garuu yoo godhe homaa hin turre.
They were friends, her friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota turan, hiriyyoota ishee turan.
But he couldn't say anything.	Garuu homaa jechuu hin dandeenye.
I wanted nothing more than to have him	Isa qabaachuu malee homaa hin barbaanne
You can’t buy me.	Na bitachuu hin dandeessu.
There is no possible reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni ta’uu danda’u hin jiru.
I can help answer it	Deebii isaa gargaaruu nan danda'a
I didn’t quite understand what he meant at the time	Yeroo sanatti maal jechuu akka barbaade sirriitti naaf hin galle
Again, this is just this week.	Ammas, kun torban kana qofa.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
That’s all, nothing more.	Kana qofa, kana caalaa homaa miti.
He knew she wanted more.	Kana caalaa akka barbaaddu ni beeka ture.
I doubt he can see me	Na arguu akka danda'u nan shakka
I have nothing else to say	Waan biraa jedhu hin qabu
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
Tonight, not so.	Halkan kana, akkas miti.
What you want doesn't come through.	Wanti ati barbaaddu keessa hin dhufu.
I do my best to keep up with him	Isa waliin deemuuf waanan dandaʼu hunda nan godha
Not any more than anywhere else.	Bakka biraa caalaa miti.
I knew the dangers better than they did	Balaa jiru isaan caalaa nan beeka ture
He had it.	Inni qaba ture.
I did, two years ago	Anis nan godhe, waggaa lama dura
I thought he really liked me	Dhuguma waan na jaallatu natti fakkaate
Sometimes, though.	Yeroo tokko tokko garuu.
I have him for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isa qaba
He would have had her.	Silaa ishee qaba ture.
She has a job to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabdu qabdi.
I couldn’t do it to her	Ani ishee irratti gochuu hin dandeenye
He, of course, has another name.	Inni, maqaa biraa akka qabu beekamaadha.
I don't think so, but it could happen.	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu, garuu ta'uu danda'a.
He thought about what you said	Waan ati jette itti yaade
I wasn’t a human being.	Ani nama hin turre.
He wanted to be me again	Ammas ana ta'uu barbaade
I was watching but couldn’t do anything about it	Ani ilaalaa ture garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
I don’t need it anymore	Kana booda na hin barbaachisu
I was being ridiculous	Ani qoosaa ta'aa ture
Not so much a car.	Konkolaataa hangas miti.
He was always right	Yeroo hundumaa sirrii ture
Now none of that exists.	Amma sun tokkollee hin jiru.
That's one of the things we don't want to happen.	Sun waan keenya ta'uu hin barbaanne keessaa tokko.
They weren’t.	Isaan hin turre.
You are here, not there.	Ati as jirta malee achi miti.
It had taken nothing away from her.	Homaa ishee irraa fudhate hin turre.
Now is not the time.	Amma yeroon isaa miti.
You can’t have any.	Tokkollee qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
Here she was a boy.	Asitti gurbaa turte.
Part of your job	Hojii kee keessaa kutaa tokko
He wasn’t with anyone else	Nama biraa waliin hin turre
It will only be one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa ta'a.
My problem is sometimes I don't know what it is.	Rakkoon koo yeroo tokko tokko maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
She never said his name.	Maqaa isaa jettee hin beektu.
So, he, now knows.	Kanaaf, inni, amma beeka.
I don’t think he’s great at anything.	Waan tokko irratti waan guddaa natti hin fakkaatu.
No problems so far.	Hanga ammaatti rakkoo hin qabu.
One was my father.	Tokko abbaa koo ture.
I thought it was pretty cool	Baayyee namatti tola jedheen yaade
But, to do this, we need many of us, working together.	Garuu, kana gochuuf baay’ee keenya, waliin hojjechuu nu barbaachisa.
I think I need one of us now	Tokko keenya amma na barbaachisa jedheen yaada
I didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
I wanted it, more than anything	Ani barbaade, waan hundumaa caalaa
I was looking for answers	Deebii barbaadaa ture
You still have to do it.	Ammas gochuu qabda.
I was pretty sure of this.	Kana baay'een mirkanaa'aa ture.
I always loved that one	Yeroo hundumaa isa sana nan jaalladha ture
It never worked, of course.	Gonkumaa hin hojjenne, beekamaadha.
I was very happy today	Har'a baay'een gammade
You are the one.	Ati isa tokko.
I don't know if this works.	Kun hojjechuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
Maybe he's here.	Tarii inni as jira ta'a.
I mean, just absolutely great.	Jechuun koo, guutummaatti guddaa qofa jechuu kooti.
She will never think of him.	Isheen yoomiyyuu isa hin yaaddu.
I looked up at the clock	Sa'aatii sana ol jedheen ilaale
Probably not.	Akkas taʼuu dhiisuu hin oolu.
I wouldn’t say that.	Ani akkas hin jedhu ture.
Not so sure.	Akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
It works just like that.	Akkuma kana ni hojjeta.
I thought you could do it	Ni dandeessaa jedheen yaade
But I didn't know your name	Maqaa kee garuu hin beeku ture
I think you know him	Ati isa beektu natti fakkaata
I don't mean to be.	Ta'uu jechuu koo miti.
He is nothing like that.	Inni homaa akkas miti.
Just to make that perfectly clear.	Sana guutummaatti ifa gochuuf qofa.
This was not easy.	Kun salphaa hin turre.
From this issue.	Dhimma kana irraa.
Not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf miti.
None of them are there.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
I think she knew that at the time	Yeroo sanatti sana waan beektu natti fakkaata
Of course, this means a couple of things.	Kun waan tokko lama jechuu akka ta’e beekamaadha.
Otherwise, they will know.	Yoo kana hin taane ni beeku.
He is working there.	Achitti hojjechaa jira.
I couldn’t stay with him all the time	Yeroo hundumaa isa bira turuu hin dandeenye
I can't always last long	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u
This is not good.	Kun gaarii miti.
A very good day.	Guyyaa baayyee gaarii.
I love, love, love them.	Isaan nan jaalladha, nan jaalladha, nan jaalladha.
It doesn't matter if you're right or not.	Sirrii ta'uu fi dhiisuu kee homaa hin qabu.
One doesn’t do that in my house.	Tokko mana koo keessatti akkas hin godhu.
She has no idea.	Yaada hin qabdu.
This one seemed right.	Inni kun sirrii fakkaata ture.
He wasn’t there yet.	Ammallee achi hin turre.
They were all good people.	Hundi isaanii namoota gaarii turan.
He hasn't done it yet.	Ammallee hin goone.
He was absolutely right.	Inni guutummaatti sirrii ture.
It was in the workplace.	Bakka hojii keessa ture.
Now, she didn’t see his issue.	Amma, isheen dhimma isaa hin argine.
First of all, the good stuff.	Dura waan gaarii.
It was true.	Dhugaa ture.
I just like to say that	Akkas jechuu qofa natti tola
It was happening now.	Amma ta'aa ture.
Just for tonight though.	Halkan kanaaf qofa garuu.
I like the light of this one	Ifa isa kanaa natti tola
That would have been bad.	Silaa sun hamaa ture.
That’s how he knew.	Akkasitti beeka ture.
Not really.	Dhuguma miti.
I just need to know what to do	Waan godhu beekuu qofa na barbaachisa
There was only one problem.	Rakkoon tokko qofa ture.
I think that's what's important.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma natti fakkaata.
So far, none of them have been a problem.	Hanga ammaatti isaan keessaa tokkollee rakkoon hin turre.
But this is.	Garuu kun.
I just can't believe it	Ani qofa amanuu hin danda'u
I didn’t have time to think about it	Yeroon itti yaadu hin qabu ture
Most of the time it doesn't happen.	Yeroo baay'ee hin ta'u.
I love it so much!!.	Ani baay'een jaalladha!!.
I didn’t know where to go	Eessa akkan deemu hin beeku ture
There would be only one more month.	Ji'a tokko qofa kan biraa ni jiraata ture.
All the more reason to do it	Sababni hunda caalaa hojjechuuf
It works so well.	Ni hojjeta akka malee gaarii dha.
Not exactly the same.	Sirriitti tokko miti.
It worked well for him.	Akka gaariitti isaaf hojjete.
I just didn’t see him like that	Akkasitti isa hin argine qofa
I can't play along anymore	Kana booda waliin taphachuu hin danda'u
I know exactly what you are going through	Waan keessa jirtu sirriitti beeka
But it’s not us.	Garuu nu miti.
But we still had hope.	Garuu ammas abdii qabna turre.
We talked about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dubbanne.
It was often enough.	Yeroo baayʼee gahaa ture.
I wasn’t expecting anyone	Nama tokkollee eegaa hin turre
Great.	Guddaa.
This time, you’re in luck.	Yeroo kana, carraa qabda.
I can still do my job	Ammallee hojii koo hojjechuu nan danda'a
He looked this way and that.	Karaa kanaa fi achi ilaale.
I couldn’t ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
I looked around the room	Kutaa sana keessa naannoo koo ilaale
He had no chance.	Carraa hin qabu ture.
What happened in the morning.	Wanti ganama ta'e.
I couldn't live without it	Isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u ture
He didn't have it.	Hin qabu ture.
I know he can do it.	Akka danda'u nan beeka.
Nothing is more important to us.	Nuuf wanti kana caalaa barbaachisaa ta’e hin jiru.
Just some of what he needs.	Waan isa barbaachisu keessaa muraasa qofa.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Kanaaf sababni lama jiraachuu danda’a.
Sometimes I do that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas nan godha.
I love him so much, I can't do that to him	Ani baay'een isa jaalladha, akkas isa irratti gochuu hin danda'u
There is nothing to tell him though.	Waan itti himu hin jiru garuu.
Now I haven’t made the same mistake.	Amma dogoggora wal fakkaatu hin hojjenne.
It’s obvious why you’re here.	Maaliif akka as jirtu ifaadha.
It almost looks like a reverse error.	Dogoggora duubatti deebi'uu fakkaata jechuun ni danda'ama.
She wouldn't have known.	Silaa hin beektu turte.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
It probably won't work.	Hin hojjetu ta'uu hin oolu.
One, two, three.	Tokko, lama, sadii.
Find out the truth.	Dhugaa jiru barbaadaa.
I didn't want him to be human	Nama akka ta'u hin barbaanne
Apparently he had been drinking that all his life.	Jireenya isaa guutuu akkas dhugaa ture fakkaata.
But it’s not entirely wrong.	Garuu guutummaatti dogoggora miti.
It was an obvious opportunity, then.	Carraa ifa ta’e ture, kanaaf.
he asked himself.	jedhee of gaafate.
I can't find any errors	Dogoggora tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u
They were right to some extent.	Hamma tokko sirrii turan.
I think it's a very good book	Kitaaba baayyee gaarii ta'e natti fakkaata
You have enough of them.	Isaan gahaa qabda.
I think that’s important	Sun barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
It’s not our problem.	Rakkoo keenya miti.
When, I can't tell.	Yoom, himuu hin danda'u.
But here he thought of something else.	Halkan garuu waan biraa yaade.
A new hope.	Abdii haaraa.
I had no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Not working too much but something.	Baay'ee hojjechuu osoo hin taane waan tokko.
Something seems wrong.	Waan tokko dogoggora fakkaata.
I didn’t want him to go	Akka inni deemu hin barbaanne
It’s happened many times.	Yeroo baay’ee ta’ee jira.
I hadn’t thought of it before	Kanaan dura hin yaadne ture
Maybe I'll never see him again	Tarii kana booda isa arguu hin danda'u
Place, place, place.	Bakka, bakka, bakka.
So .	Kanaaf .
I think we should go there	Achi deemuu qabna jedheen yaada
We hope it helps.	Akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
I think it would have looked good	Silaa gaarii fakkaata jedheen yaada
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
I mean, just look at it	Mee ilaalaa qofa jechuu kooti
But that’s how it’s always been.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
I couldn’t live like that.	Akkas jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe three of them.	Tarii sadii ta'uu danda'a.
Playing with them.	Isaan waliin taphachuu.
He can get it. 	Inni argachuu danda'a. 
You have a voice for him.	Isaaf sagalee qabda.
I can give you a name	Maqaa tokko siif kennuu nan danda'a
I really do.	Dhuguma nan godha.
He never had a chance.	Carraa argate hin beeku.
I just said I was helping	Gargaaruu qofa jedheen ture
But I haven’t even done that much yet	Garuu hanga ammaatti hanga kana illee hin hojjenne
Looks like you still have a ways to go.	Ammallee karaa itti deemtu waan qabdu fakkaata.
I think this is a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii natti fakkaata.
I still didn’t know his name	Ammallee maqaa isaa hin beeku ture
I want to be with you	Si waliin ta'uu barbaada
It was mine.	Kan koo ture.
I'm not waiting.	Ani eegaa hin jiru.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
Didn't see him much	Baay'ee isa hin argine
All the good stuff.	Wantoota gaarii hunda.
You're not here today.	Har'a as hin jirtu.
I must be the one.	Ani ta'uu qaba.
Man would have been fine	Namni silaa gaarii ta'a
I can't see that happening.	Akkas ta'uu arguu hin danda'u.
I didn't know that was your father	Sun abbaa kee ta'uu hin beeku ture
I can't even scream anymore	Kana booda iyyuu hin danda'u
But that can’t be the case.	Garuu sun ta’uu hin danda’u.
There was nothing working.	Wanti hojjetu hin turre.
He has a very good eye.	Ija baayyee gaarii qaba.
He knew both places well	Bakka lamaan sirriitti beeka ture
But it didn’t seem to matter.	Garuu waan dhimma qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
You have to do what she wants.	Waan isheen barbaaddu gochuu qabda.
I haven’t seen anyone in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf nama hin argine.
I already know who you are	Eenyu akka taate duruu beeka
I want to give you a name	Maqaa siif kennuu barbaada
The 'how' is no longer relevant.	'Akkamitti' jedhu amma barbaachisaa miti.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
I just couldn’t have it	Ani qofa qabaachuu hin dandeenye
The feeling that someone was watching me	Miira namni tokko na ilaalaa ture
If this is the case, this is not a problem.	Yoo kun ta'e kun rakkoo hin qabu.
I know more about it than you do	Si caalaa waa'ee isaa beeka
One thing just doesn’t seem quite right to me.	Wanti tokko qofa guutummaatti sirrii natti hin fakkaatu.
I can still get you the real thing	Ammallee waan dhugaa siif argachuu nan danda'a
I wasn’t the same person	Ani nama tokko hin turre
Now the house.	Amma mana.
You have to be yourself.	Of ta'uu qabda.
I didn't need her anymore today	Har'a booda ishee hin barbaachisu ture
It was really easy.	Dhuguma salphaa ture.
I think it works well for me	Akka gaariitti naaf hojjeta jedheen yaada
We did our job.	Hojii keenya hojjenne.
You are not from here.	Ati as irraa miti.
I know a lot of people	Namoota baay'een beeka
If something happens.	Yoo wanti tokko ta'e.
He told us later.	Booda nutti hime.
No one knew me.	Namni na beeku hin turre.
This is becoming too easy.	Kun garmalee salphaa ta'aa jira.
He used to teach her mother	Duraan haadha ishee barsiisaa ture
Good from bad.	Gaarii hamaa irraa.
This was too much, too soon.	Kun garmalee ture, dafee ture.
You can give up, of course.	Harka kennuu dandeessa, beekamaadha.
I didn’t think of you at all	Ani tasumaa si hin yaadne
Couldn’t do anything about that.	Sana irratti homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
He told them their names	Maqaa isaanii itti hime
Wait a while though.	Yeroo muraasa eegaa garuu.
I can't have one of mine	Kan koo tokko qabaachuu hin danda'u
This is exactly what would have happened.	Kun sirriitti waan silaa ta'a ture.
I could say a lot of things	Waan hedduu dubbachuu nan danda'a ture
Just a lot of comments like that.	Yaada akkasii baay'ee qofa.
It just wouldn't happen.	Hin ta'u qofa ture.
They were right about some things.	Waa'ee wantoota tokko tokko sirrii turan.
He had no home	Mana hin qabu ture
I didn't want to be alone	Kophaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
Very much like that.	Baayyee akkas.
I’m not that person anymore.	Kana booda ani nama sana miti.
I didn’t see any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee hin argine
I doubt he will.	Akka inni godhu nan shakka.
I knew it had to go somewhere	Bakka tokko deemuu akka qabu nan beeka ture
He’s not even an adult.	Inni nama guddaa illee miti.
It didn’t work until recently	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti hin hojjenne
But before that, it is usually very nice.	Garuu sana dura yeroo baayyee baayyee namatti tola.
I can always help, you know	Yeroo hundumaa gargaaruu nan danda'a, beekta
As of the present time.	Akka yeroo ammaatti.
I hoped she was still with him	Ammallee isa waliin akka jirtu abdiin qaba ture
Everything you really need.	Waan dhuguma si barbaachisu hunda.
Everything was in working order.	Wanti hundi haala hojii irra ture.
I thought it was still there	Ammas waan jiru natti fakkaate
I came for you.	Siif jedheen dhufe.
I was just kidding about it	Ani itti qoosaa qofa ture
Maybe not everyone.	Tarii nama hunda miti.
I need you to do this for me	Kana akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa
He was looking into his eyes	Ija isaa ilaalaa ture
I hadn’t been able to have any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee qabaachuu hin dandeenye ture.
I mean, you're right	Ati sirrii jechuu kooti
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
I want to be a good person like that.	Nama gaarii akkas ta'uu barbaada.
It was important, he told himself.	Barbaachisaa ture jedhee ofitti hime.
I don’t know what to do with myself	Waan ofitti godhu hin beeku
But this was not the case.	Kun garuu akkas hin turre.
I knew that this was the real thing	Wanti dhugaa taʼe kana akka taʼe nan beeka ture
I wasn’t interested.	Ani fedhii hin qabu ture.
I am nothing like that.	Ani homaa akkas miti.
What do you have?.	Maal qabdu?.
I don't think it's a dog.	Saree natti hin fakkaatu.
But this was too much.	Garuu kun garmalee ture.
You have an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko qabda.
But really, it’s not.	Garuu dhuguma, akkas miti.
What does she look like.	Maal isheen fakkaattu.
That's for sure	Kana mirkanaa'aa dha
I’m working on something.	Waan tokko irratti hojjechaa jira.
Not a bad day’s work.	Hojii guyyaa hamaa miti.
I don't know how, not yet	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku, ammallee miti
Not a great idea.	Yaada guddaa mitii.
You can purchase the book here.	Kitaaba kana as irraa bitachuu dandeessu.
Will know more later.	Booda caalaatti ni beeka.
I didn't understand what her problem was	Rakkoon ishee maal akka ta'e naaf hin galle
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
Only you can handle her.	Kan ishee danda'u si qofa.
He had no name, no home	Maqaa hin qabu, mana hin qabu ture
Maybe it will work.	Tarii ni hojjeta ta'a.
They have no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qaban.
Look at it again.	Ammas ilaalaa.
I hope it wasn’t long	Yeroo dheeraa akka hin turre abdiin qaba
Maybe, even the same.	Tarii, wal fakkaatu illee ta'a.
You might think that is perfectly fine.	Sun guutummaatti gaarii dha jettanii yaaddu taʼa.
We need your help.	Gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa.
I had no idea what that might mean	Sun maal jechuu akka dandaʼu yaada hin qabu ture
Maybe it will never go away.	Tarii gonkumaa hin deemu ta'a.
I know what her problem is	Rakkoon ishee maal akka ta'e nan beeka
She hadn’t seen his hand yet.	Harka isaa hanga ammaatti hin argine turte.
I would not hesitate to stay there again	Ammas achi jiraachuu irraa duubatti hin jedhu ture
He had such high hopes all afternoon	Waaree booda guutuu abdii guddaa akkasii qaba ture
Which is fine, but that’s all	Kan gaarii, garuu sana qofa
Someone is looking for you.	Namni si barbaada.
Something I rarely saw.	Waan yeroo muraasaaf qofa arge.
I looked around the room	Anis kutaa sana keessa ilaale
What were you doing.	Maal hojjechaa turte.
I just care about you so much	Ani baay'ee siif yaada qofa
He is not their man.	Nama isaanii miti.
Not sure what is going wrong.	Waan dogoggora ta'aa jiru mirkanaa'aa miti.
I knew she liked him, but still	Isheen akka isa jaallattu nan beeka ture, garuu ammas
I know him better than you do	Ani si caalaa isa beeka
Let me know if it's something you're looking for.	Waan barbaaddu yoo ta'e natti himi.
Now they don’t need it.	Amma isaan hin barbaachisu.
I doubt there is any hope for me.	Abdiin akka naaf jiru nan shakka.
I think it's just the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ta'e qofa natti fakkaata.
He hadn’t gone away.	Inni hin deemne ture.
I didn’t know her that well	Ani akkasitti ishee hin beeku ture
I wanted to say something many times	Yeroo baay'ee waan tokko dubbachuu barbaade
Not again, he thought.	Ammas miti jedhee yaade.
I doubt the whole thing took an hour.	Wanti hundi sa'aatii tokko akka fudhate nan shakka.
Someone was watching me.	Namni tokko na ilaalaa ture.
He is the one who	Inni waan .
I knew he was great	Guddaa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
I want to be in the here and now	Ani as fi amma keessa ta'uu barbaada
Everyone went away.	Hundi deeme.
I want to make this clear	Kana ifa gochuun barbaada
I still have no idea what is going on	Ammallee waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu
What is that.	Sun maali.
I couldn't even tell you why	Maaliif akka ta'e illee sitti himuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t understand that at all	Sana tasumaa naaf hin galle
Not much else.	Waan biraa baay'ee miti.
But no one knows anything.	Garuu namni homaa hin beeku.
It doesn't have to be that way, but it is.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu, garuu ni jira.
That’s not bad at all.	Sun tasumaa hamaa miti.
But he enjoyed it.	Inni garuu itti gammade.
It was you.	Ati ture.
After a while I saw him coming after us	Yeroo muraasa booda nu booda dhufuu isaa arge
I can't believe it only lasted a week	Torban tokko qofa akka ture amanuu hin danda'u
There was a lot of drinking.	Dhugaatii baay'ee ture.
He might know what that is.	Sun maal akka taʼe beekuu dandaʼa.
We had one car that was.	Konkolaataa tokko qabna turre kan ture.
Just hang out with them sometimes, that’s all	Yeroo tokko tokko isaan waliin taphachuu qofa, kana qofa
She will never go to school.	Yoomiyyuu mana barumsaa hin deemtu.
I was the one.	Ani isa ture.
All are the same to us.	Hundi nuuf tokko.
I certainly wasn’t	Ani akkan hin turre beekamaadha
That’s not that long.	Sun hangas dheeraa miti.
He looked up at her.	Ol jedhee ilaale.
He was good, so good.	Inni gaarii ture, akkas gaarii ture.
We got along very well.	Baayyee gaarii waliin walii galle.
It didn’t seem real.	Dhugaa hin fakkaatu ture.
I need it so badly.	Ani akka malee na barbaachisa.
It was late in the afternoon.	Yeroon isaa waaree booda ture.
We have to work together, all the time.	Waliin hojjechuu qabna, yeroo hunda.
I'm not going there again.	Ammas achi hin deemu.
It’s not their voice.	Sagalee isaanii miti.
I wondered when all this happened	Kun hundi yoom ta'e jedheen yaade
But he did some thinking.	Garuu yaada tokko tokko godhe.
There is no home answer.	Deebii manaa hin jiru.
I looked at him again, really looked at him	Ammas isa ilaale, dhuguma isa ilaale
He wanted to know where she was going.	Eessa akka deemtu beekuu barbaade.
He knows the place, of course.	Bakka sana ni beeka, beekamaadha.
You really should stop doing that.	Dhuguma sana gochuu dhiisuu qabda.
This was just plain wrong.	Kun dogoggora ifa ta’e qofa ture.
I just really wanted you there	Ani achitti baay'een si barbaade qofa
He has to go now.	Amma deemuu qaba.
I never wanted to come back here	Asitti deebi'uu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
I know what you want to do	Waan gochuu barbaaddu nan beeka
I can't stay anywhere for long	Bakka tokko illee yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u
It’s never been very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa ta’ee hin beeku.
It was a great night	Halkan guddaa ture
I love how you are with me	Akkamitti akka ati na waliin jirtu baay'een jaalladha
You don't want money.	Maallaqa hin barbaaddu.
You have to believe in it.	Itti amanuu qabda.
Not even his real name.	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa illee miti.
I know what he likes	Waan inni jaallatu nan beeka
This can’t be the case.	Kun ta’uu hin danda’u.
Someone was there who needed to know about it.	Namni waa'ee kanaa beekuu qabu tokko achi ture.
But you don't.	Garuu hin gootu.
That's all.	Kanuma qofa.
They never ever became true.	Isaan gonkumaa gonkumaa dhugaa hin taane.
But that was true, it wasn’t.	Garuu sun dhugaa ture, hin turre.
I don’t want to make another mistake.	Dogoggora biraa hojjechuu hin barbaadu.
I would have never said it before.	Silaa kanaan dura jedhee hin beeku.
I didn't want to be hopeful	Abdii qabaachuu hin barbaanne ture
But it was her only passerby.	Garuu nama karaa irra deemu ishee qofa ture.
He has something to say.	Waan jedhu qaba.
I knew there had to be	Jiraachuu akka qabu nan beeka ture
I didn't think of anything else	Waan biraa hin yaadne
I had you two years later	Waggaa lama booda si qaba ture
I have a good feel for this one	Isa kanaa miira gaarii qaba
But it is of no help.	Garuu gargaarsa tokkollee hin qabu.
A big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa.
I wasn’t good at all	Ani tasumaa gaarii hin turre
But that's not really what's going on here.	Garuu dhuguma wanti asitti ta'aa jiru sun miti.
I didn’t want to meet them.	Isaan waliin wal arguu hin barbaanne.
They don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qaban.
That was a mistake that should never have happened.	Sun dogoggora gonkumaa ta'uu hin qabne ture.
I thought he would be nice about it, but he wasn't	Waa'ee kanaa ni tola jedheen yaade, garuu akkas hin taane
I thought I knew.	Ani beeka jedhee yaade.
I just love you where you are	Bakka jirtu qofa si jaalladha
But it may be for a while.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf ta'uu danda'a.
I wasn't sure she was sure	Mirkanaa'aa akka taate mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I couldn't tell him.	Itti himuu hin dandeenye.
I looked at her but she wasn’t looking at me	Ishee ilaale malee isheen na ilaalaa hin turre
It was there though.	Achi ture garuu.
That became a major problem throughout his career.	Sun bara hojii isaa hunda keessatti rakkoo guddaa ta'e.
I had no idea there was so much going on	Waan baay'een akka jiru yaada hin qabu ture
He has to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu qaba.
No one knew who we were	Eenyu akka taane namni beeku hin turre
He exists but does not exist.	Inni jira malee hin jiru.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
I don't quite understand	Ani sirriitti naaf hin galle
He had no way to help with that	Sana irratti karaa itti gargaaru hin qabu ture
That’s really how it started.	Dhuguma akkasitti jalqabe.
It was a good one.	Gaarii ture.
It must be all night.	Halkan guutuu ta'uu qaba.
I think he loves you	Inni si jaallatu natti fakkaata
That’s what got my dad a job there.	Abbaa koo hojii achitti argate kanuma.
I knew it was true	Dhugaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture
They love him in there.	Achi keessa isa jaallatu.
I can still do it.	Ammallee gochuu nan danda'a.
We have some time.	Yeroo muraasa qabna.
I didn't want to.	Ani hin barbaanne.
Two pairs of eyes staring back at her	Ija lama lama ishee duubatti ilaalaa jiru
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
I want you here for a few hours	Sa'aatii muraasaaf asitti si barbaada
That we are.	Akka nuti.
He gave everything he had.	Waan qabu hunda kenne.
But it looks good.	Garuu gaarii fakkaata.
I can't leave her there	Achitti ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u
You don’t need it.	Si hin barbaachisu.
Lots of new questions to ask her	Gaaffii haaraa baay'een ishee gaafachuu qabu
It just has so many emotions.	Miira baay'ee qofa qaba.
I can still see it	Ammallee arguu nan danda'a
A little out of the way, but still nice	Xiqqoo karaa irraa ba'e, garuu ammas namatti tola
I’m still working on it.	Ammas irratti hojjechaa jira.
One was bad and one was good.	Tokko hamaa tokko gaarii ture.
It just needs some work.	Hojii tokko tokko qofa barbaada.
I think it works better.	Kana caalaa hojjeta jedheen yaada.
I thought about this	Kanaan yaade
I don't think about it	Ani itti hin yaadu
He didn't do much more.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee hin hojjenne.
That’s really all there is to it.	Dhuguma wanti jiru kana qofa.
It just seems a little outdated.	Xiqqoo yeroon isaa darbe fakkaata qofa.
Maybe it's the night.	Tarii halkan ta'uu danda'a.
I don’t want anything more from her	Kana caalaa homaa ishee irraa hin barbaadu
She said I was going.	Ani deemaa jira jette.
We agreed with them.	Isaan irratti walii galle.
Otherwise, sorry.	Kanaan ala dhiifama.
This can’t be the case.	Kun ta’uu hin danda’u.
I want to know what that looks like	Sun maal akka fakkaatu beekuu barbaada
A great guy.	Gurbaa guddaa.
I thought it was a dog	Saree natti fakkaate
A little sorry this has to happen	Dhiifama xiqqoo kun ta'uu qaba
I didn't want to have to say it.	Jechuun dirqama ta'uu hin barbaanne ture.
It’s nothing but work, work, work.	Hojii, hojii, hojii malee homaa miti.
Sometimes after his work.	Yeroo tokko tokko hojii isaa booda.
I have no voice anymore	Kana booda sagalee hin qabu
I don’t know why it took so long though.	Maaliif akka yeroo dheeraa itti fudhate hin beeku garuu.
I couldn’t live with that	Sana waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye
It has to be right here, otherwise you can't ask.	Asitti sirriitti ta'uu qaba, yoo kana hin taane gaafachuu hin dandeessu.
She should have forgiven me.	Silaa naaf dhiisuu qabdi turte.
I know it was a mistake.	Dogoggora akka ture nan beeka.
I thought you said it	Akka ati jette natti fakkaate
I hope that was funny.	Sun qoosaa akka ture abdiin qaba.
The same thing happened a couple of days later	Guyyaa lama lama booda kanuma ta'e
It took two months.	Ji'a lama fudhate.
I can't do it now.	Amma hin danda'u.
But it is not like that	Garuu akkas miti
Things looked good.	Wanti gaarii fakkaata ture.
I went with them	Anis isaan waliin deeme
Someone she was working with.	Nama isheen waliin hojjechaa turte.
Then again, maybe you're right.	Sana booda ammas tarii sirrii ta'uu dandeessa.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
It could have worked.	Silaa hojjechuu danda'a ture.
I want to ask him many things	Waan hedduu isa gaafachuu barbaada
Sometimes it doesn't.	Yeroo tokko tokko hin ta'u.
I didn't think he wanted to talk about it	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu waan barbaadu natti hin fakkaatu ture
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf.
It’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola.
I don't mean for this to happen	Kun akka ta'u jechuu koo miti
That's it.	Kanuma.
He saw a place where there was no life	Bakka jireenya hin qabne arge
I could never live like that	Ani gonkumaa akkas jiraachuu hin dandeenye
One, it is wrong.	Tokko, dogoggora dha.
But you really don’t.	Garuu dhuguma hin qabdu.
I had no intention of doing that today	Har'a akkas gochuuf yaada hin qabu ture
Mostly none of them.	Irra caalaa isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
Not too bad in the long run.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti baayyee hamaa miti.
I don't think this is a problem	Kun rakkoo natti hin fakkaatu
I didn’t want this to go any further	Kun kana caalaa akka deemu hin barbaanne
This just started this week.	Kun torban kana qofa jalqabe.
I didn’t know what to do about it.	Kana irratti maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
I can't speak.	Dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Love your life.	Jireenya kee jaalladhu.
But I didn't care	Ani garuu dhimma hin qabu ture
I know you don’t have that kind of money	Maallaqa akkasii akka hin qabne nan beeka
He shouldn't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
You are not like us.	Ati akka keenya miti.
I hoped it wasn’t money	Maallaqa akka hin taane abdiin qaba ture
I think we have something in common	Waan wal fakkaatu qabna jedheen yaada
I want to ask you something	Waan tokko si gaafachuu barbaada
I was the only one he was looking at	Kan inni ilaalaa ture ana qofa ture
Look up there.	Achi ol ilaalaa.
I still like them.	Ammallee isaan natti tola.
That's how time went, a lot of it.	Akkasitti yeroon darbe, baay'een isaa.
They can be hours.	Sa’aatii ta’uu danda’u.
I couldn’t really say	Dhuguma jechuu hin dandeenye
He thought about what he had said	Waan inni jedhe itti yaade
I can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
They are still working.	Ammas hojjechaa jiru.
I know he looked at me	Akka na ilaale nan beeka
There must be.	Jiraachuu qaba.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Waan ta'u hin beeku ture
She had to go.	Deemu qabdi turte.
I know her name.	Maqaa ishee nan beeka.
They are doing very, very well.	Baayyee baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
I know you want a life that is your own	Jireenya kan kee ta'e akka barbaaddu nan beeka
I’m glad I went.	Deemuu kootti gammadeera.
It’s mine, not mine.	Kan kooti malee kan koo miti.
I can't see how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e arguu hin danda'u.
He knew that voice.	Sagalee sana ni beeka ture.
I hadn't thought much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne ture
Go on the road.	Karaa irra deemaa.
Maybe more than that sometimes.	Tarii yeroo tokko tokko kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t even see him	Isa illee hin argine
You need something else.	Waan biraa si barbaachisa.
I don’t want any more.	Kana caalaa hin barbaadu.
What does that look like.	Sun maal fakkaata.
It wants to be in your arms and stay there	Harka kee keessa ta'ee achi turuu barbaada
She was home, of course.	Isheen mana akka turte beekamaadha.
I hope that is not the case	Akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba
I can't say anything bad about them at all	Waa'ee isaanii waan hamaa dubbachuu hin danda'u tasumaa
I think it would have been helpful, you know	Silaa gargaaruu danda'a jedheen yaada, beekta
But he was more than that.	Inni garuu kana caalaa ture.
I wouldn’t have done that to you	Silaa akkas si hin godhu ture
Now you know most everything.	Amma waan hundumaa irra caalaa beekta.
I don't think so.	Akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
But, look, there they are.	Garuu, ilaalaa, achi jiru.
Long enough to make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuuf dheeraa.
Like really bad.	Akka dhuguma hamaa.
It’s not my business.	Dhimma koo miti.
He wanted to say her name but couldn’t	Maqaa ishee dubbachuu barbaade garuu hin dandeenye
Tell me what you want me to say.	Waan akkan jedhu barbaaddu natti himi.
I wondered why he did that	Maaliif akkas godhe jedheen yaade
I didn’t want to know any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee beekuu hin barbaanne
I think it will fit you well	Akka gaariitti siif ta'a jedheen yaada
That didn’t last long.	Sun yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I had no idea what to think about it	Waa'ee kanaa maal akkan yaadu yaada hin qabu ture
She doesn't care.	Isheen dhimma hin qabdu.
Is there such a thing?.	Wanti akkasii jiraa?.
I told him that wasn’t enough time	Yeroon sun gahaa akka hin taane itti hime
They expected more.	Kana caalaa eegaa turan.
I know what it’s like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka
It was a simple fact.	Dhugaa salphaa ture.
You don’t know what you want.	Waan barbaaddu hin beektu.
She had time.	Yeroo qabdi turte.
I have been looking for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf barbaadaa tureera
I’m not like that either	Anis akkas miti
But the real problem is people.	Garuu rakkoon dhugaa namoota.
I could do it quick and easy for you	Dafee fi salphaa siif gochuu nan danda'a ture
But, well, funny.	Garuu, gaarii dha, qoosaa.
That wasn’t that long ago.	Sun hangas yeroo dheeraa dura miti.
I can't even	Hin danda'u illee .
Glad I found him	Isa argachuu kootti gammadeera
He was that good.	Inni akkas gaarii ture.
He knew all this already	Kana hunda duruu beeka ture
I didn’t agree with this.	Kana irratti walii hin galle.
Just my name and nothing else.	Maqaa koo qofa malee waan biraa miti.
I know his voice	Sagalee isaa nan beeka
It looked pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
While you still can.	Osoo ammallee dandeessu.
It doesn’t help me.	Na hin gargaaru.
Look at him.	Isa ilaalaa.
I think everyone knows who he is	Namni hundi eenyu akka ta'e waan beeku natti fakkaata
He had a job.	Hojii qaba ture.
I'm just so excited.	Ani baay'een gammade qofa.
In the bar.	Mana dhugaatii keessatti.
I can't do that.	Akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
But there things were serious.	Garuu achitti wanti hamaa ture.
He doesn't have a single voice.	Sagalee tokko hin qabu.
Two things became very clear to me.	Wanti lama baay’ee naaf ifa ta’e.
No one got it.	Namni argate hin jiru.
I know a few of them	Isaan keessaa muraasa nan beeka
That was certainly the case.	Akkas akka ture beekamaadha.
I want him really well	Dhuguma akka gaariitti isa barbaada
We have more than enough space.	Bakka gahaa ol qabna.
He didn't do this.	Kana hin goone.
I love you, my wife.	Si jaalladha haadha manaa koo.
That’s how it went.	Akkasitti deeme.
I hope they have a dog	Saree akka qaban abdiin qaba
I couldn’t quite see myself	Guutummaatti of arguu hin dandeenye
I don't have the reason you have.	Sababni ati qabdu hin qabu.
They have no eyes.	Ija hin qaban.
But of course, they certainly didn’t need her.	Garuu beekamaadha, akka isheen isaan hin barbaachifne beekamaadha.
I know them, they know me	Ani isaan beeka, isaan na beeku
So far I've really enjoyed it	Hanga ammaatti baay'een itti gammadeera
I want you to think of something in your room	Kutaa kee keessatti waan tokko akka yaaddu nan barbaada
We went yesterday.	Kaleessa deemne.
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
I didn't want to believe it.	Anis amanuu hin barbaanne.
He had no mother	Haadha hin qabu ture
I really didn’t think that was her problem	Dhuguma rakkoon ishee akkas natti hin fakkaatu ture
That’s really incorrect.	Sun dhuguma sirrii miti.
Even he may not have seen this performance coming.	Inni illee ga'umsa kana dhufuu isaa hin argine ta'a.
This time, however, it is different.	Yeroo kana garuu adda.
It was just that good.	Akkas qofa gaarii ture.
He hadn’t thought about it.	Inni itti hin yaadne ture.
He became one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'e.
I didn’t know her, at all	Ani ishee hin beekne, tasumaa
But everyone did everything.	Garuu namni hundi waan hunda hojjete.
I know what you want	Waan ati barbaaddu nan beeka
I'm the one.	Ani isa.
They needed every little bit of it.	Xiqqoo isaa hunda isaan barbaachisa ture.
I really didn’t know what to do with this part	Dhuguma kutaa kanaan maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I always look for ways.	Yeroo hundumaa karaa nan barbaada.
Not sure if I was clear in my question.	Gaaffii koo keessatti ifa ta'uu fi dhiisuu koo mirkanaa'aa miti.
There's a lot on it.	Waan baay'ee irra jira.
But he went away.	Inni garuu ni deeme.
It’s all the same.	Hundi isaa tokko.
It still hadn’t happened.	Ammallee hin taane ture.
I am exactly the same	Anis sirriitti wal fakkaata
I wish she hadn't done this	Osoo isheen kana hin goone ta'ee natti tola
I couldn’t do anything about it	Ani garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
It's a chance for you.	Carraa siif ta'a.
I was waiting for a month.	Ji'a tokko eegaa ture.
I was alone and often very lonely	Kophaa koo fi yeroo baayʼee baayʼee kophaa koo ture
They love it.	Ni jaallatu.
I knew she was there	Isheen achi akka jirtu nan beeka ture
That way you can live with the answer.	Akkasitti deebii isaa waliin jiraachuu dandeessa.
This doesn’t have to be a big deal.	Kun dirqama guddaa ta’uu hin qabu.
Someone should know.	Namni tokko beekuu qaba.
I was one of those people.	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko ture.
I want to be on this	Kana irratti ta'uu barbaada
It was something new.	Waan haaraa ture.
I hope it will be one	Tokko akka ta'u abdiin qaba
I am a human being like you.	Ani akkuma kee nama.
I didn't know about anything else though	Waa'ee waan biraa garuu hin beeku ture
I want to come back soon	Dafee deebi'uu barbaada
All around my mother.	Naannoo haadha koo hunda.
I wasn’t bad, she said	Ani hamaa hin turre jette
People know about us.	Namoonni waa'ee keenya ni beeku.
He just bought it here.	Inni amma asitti bite.
But I would never, ever say that	Ani garuu gonkumaa, yoomiyyuu akkas hin jedhu
There were a lot of emotions.	Miira baay'een ture.
But many of them don't.	Garuu baay'een isaanii hin qaban.
I think they might all be the same book	Tarii hundi isaanii kitaaba tokko ta'uu danda'u jedheen yaada
I know he's different	Inni adda ta'uu isaa nan beeka
I used to not do that	Duraan akkas hin godhu ture
I don't know what happened then	Yeroo sanatti maaltu akka ta'e hin beeku
I know a lot about them	Waa'ee isaanii waan baay'een beeka
Tell me everything.	Waan hundumaa natti himi.
We hope we can.	Akka dandeenyu abdii qabna.
He didn’t need it anymore.	Kana booda isa hin barbaachisu ture.
He would have been good at it	Silaa irratti gaarii ta'a ture
It was then that he began.	Yeroo sana ture kan inni jalqabe.
You are not one of them.	Ati isaan keessaa tokko miti.
But that wasn’t on time.	Garuu sun yeroo irratti hin turre.
Maybe she's right.	Tarii isheen sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
He never thinks of me again.	Kana booda gonkumaa na hin yaadu.
It was a good meal.	Nyaata gaarii ture.
I can't do anything	Ani homaa gochuu hin danda'u
Lucky man, he thought, he didn’t have any real problems.	Namni carraa qabu, rakkoo dhugaa tokkollee akka hin qabne yaade.
I'm excited.	Ani gammadeera.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Akkas ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
He has questions to ask	Gaaffii gaafachuu qabu qaba
Maybe it doesn't matter.	Tarii homaa hin qabu ta'a.
It just worked.	Hojjete qofa.
Then it becomes a much bigger problem.	Sana booda rakkoo baayyee guddaa ta'a.
He’s not looking for me.	Inni na barbaadaa hin jiru.
I didn't want to see it	Ani arguu hin barbaanne ture
That’s not a good time.	Yeroon sun yeroo gaarii miti.
Everyone has money.	Namni hundi maallaqa qaba.
I always thought this was over the top	Yeroo hundumaa kun waan ol ta'e jedheen yaada ture
She wasn’t alone in there.	Achi keessa kophaa ishee hin turre.
But he didn’t seem to have it.	Garuu waan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
I used to love school.	Duraan mana barumsaa nan jaalladha ture.
Thus their	Akkasitti isaanii .
He shouldn't have stayed long	Yeroo dheeraa turuu hin qabu ture
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
This is a completely new situation.	Kun haala guutummaatti haaraa dha.
He had no idea what his problem was	Rakkoon isaa maal akka taʼe yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I still care about you	Ammallee siif yaada
A week, sooner if necessary	Torban tokko, yoo barbaachisaa ta’e dafee
It was not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin turre.
I can't live without it.	Isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
You're really.	Ati dhuguma.
I was a good guy.	Ani nama gaarii ture.
It looks pretty good there though.	Achitti garuu baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
I really have to go	Dhuguma deemuun qaba
Some people do.	Namoonni tokko tokko ni godhu.
There was only one.	Tokko qofa ture.
It usually works.	Yeroo baayyee ni hojjeta.
All of me.	Hundi koo.
But where is he?.	Garuu eessa jira?.
We need to work with them.	Isaan waliin hojjechuu qabna.
Every night I know what it is	Halkan hunda maal akka ta'e nan beeka
It can't be this good.	Gaarii kana ta'uu hin danda'u.
You are watching yourself doing it.	Of gochaa jirtu ilaalaa jirta.
This thing is good.	Wanti kun gaarii dha.
It was something we needed to know.	Waan beekuu qabnu ture.
He thought it was an important job	Hojii barbaachisaa ta'e jedhee yaade
But it never happens.	Garuu gonkumaa hin ta'u.
So far, though, it looks good.	Hanga ammaatti garuu gaarii fakkaata.
I hadn’t seen him before	Kanaan dura isa hin argine ture
He wants to know everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu barbaada.
So far I haven't thought about it yet	Hanga ammaatti waa'ee kanaa hanga ammaatti hin yaadne
I want no part of this	Ani kutaa kanaa tokkollee hin barbaadu
I knew she wanted me	Isheen akka na barbaaddu nan beeka ture
It was good for him.	Isaaf gaarii ture.
I wonder how you know what we need	Waan nu barbaachisu akkamitti beekta jedheen yaada
And that’s not all.	Kana illee qofa miti.
Just like me.	Akkuma koo.
The only problem was that something was me.	Rakkoon ture wanti tokko ana ta'uu isaa qofa ture.
We don’t do it.	Hin goonu.
You have to come now.	Amma dhufuu qabda.
This is how this works here.	Asitti kun akkasitti hojjeta.
The one of the road.	Kan karaa.
Whenever it was.	Yeroo ture hunda.
This time I couldn’t walk all night	Yeroo kana halkan guutuu deemuu hin dandeenye
But we can’t help her.	Garuu ishee gargaaruu hin dandeenyu.
I always loved it	Yeroo hundumaa nan jaalladha ture
He really should come back	Dhuguma deebi'uu qaba
It would have been bad.	Silaa hamaa ta'a.
He had said it was nothing.	Homaa miti jedhee ture.
I didn’t even know her real name	Maqaa ishee isa dhugaa illee hin beeku ture
Not your mother.	Haadha kee miti.
I never tell anyone what is going on	Waan ta'aa jiru gonkumaa namatti hin himu
I didn’t belong here, he said	Ani kan as hin turre jedhee ture
But they have a problem.	Garuu rakkoo qabu.
I think it might even be true	Dhugaa illee ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
I want to know the truth	Dhugaa jiru beekuu barbaada
But now, we have.	Amma garuu, qabna.
Sometimes it works.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta.
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
It didn’t matter anymore	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu ture
They know how this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu ni beeku.
I’d rather see something else	Waan biraa arguu naaf wayya
I can speak the truth of this.	Dhugaa kanaa dubbachuu nan danda'a.
Which you are not.	Kan ati hin taane.
He's not very big.	Inni baayyee guddaa miti.
Now you are with me.	Amma na waliin jirta.
You’re not going there.	Ati achi hin deemtu.
Other than that, things are pretty good.	Kana malee wanti jiru baayyee gaarii dha.
I didn't want anyone to know about that	Waa'ee sanaa namni tokkollee akka beeku hin barbaanne
Not a good situation.	Haala gaarii miti.
I had no sense of it	Ani miira hin qabu ture
I couldn't find anything about it here.	Asitti waa'ee isaa homaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
He is not here now.	Amma as hin jiru.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
I think it was another voice	Sagalee biraa ture natti fakkaata
I doubt it very much	Baay'een shakka
I really have to go now.	Dhuguma amma deemuun qaba.
I mean, just look at them	Isaan qofa ilaalaa jechuu kooti
So I love him even more	Kanaaf caalaatti isa jaalladha
I can't speak right now	Yeroo ammaa kana dubbachuu hin danda'u
I almost told him everything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf waan hunda itti hime jechuun ni danda'ama.
It doesn’t help.	Hin gargaaru.
You know what is right.	Waan sirrii ta'e ni beekta.
I haven’t seen you around in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf naannoo si hin argine
That’s what we’re trying to do.	Kana gochuuf yaalaa jirra.
I always had a father with me here	Yeroo hundumaa asitti abbaa na waliin qaba ture
Maybe he didn't think about it.	Tarii waa'ee kanaa hin yaadne ta'a.
She couldn't be right.	Isheen sirrii ta'uu hin dandeenye.
A whole other life.	Jireenya biraa guutuu.
Maybe I can do something for you	Tarii waan tokko siif gochuu danda'a
I’ve only been in there twice	Yeroo lama qofa achi keessa ture
I think that's what happens	Akkas ta'a jedheen yaada
He should have known that	Silaa sana beekuu qaba ture
If this person is important to you then .	Yoo namni kun siif barbaachisaa ta'e sana booda .
I wouldn't have been able to see what happened to me.	Silaa wanti natti dhufe arguu hin danda'u ture.
I have no place to think	Bakka itti yaadu hin qabu
I didn’t want to see her.	Ishee arguu hin barbaanne.
I couldn’t believe him	Isa amanuu hin dandeenye
The problem is me.	Rakkoon jiru ana.
That was obviously an issue with him before.	Sun kanaan dura dhimma isa waliin ture ifaadha.
She didn't know exactly what it was.	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti hin beektu turte.
There were many of them.	Isaan baay'ee turan.
Someone already lives there.	Namni tokko duruu achi jiraata.
He is very good.	Inni baayyee gaarii dha.
This time, however, is different.	Yeroon kun garuu adda.
I didn't even know what it was	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture
I want to tell you everything	Waan hundumaa sitti himuu barbaada
But I can't see it clearly	Ani garuu sirriitti arguu hin danda'u
I don't know how, but we made it work	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu akka hojjetu goone
You will never do it.	Yoomiyyuu hin gootu.
That's why it happens.	Kanaaf ni ta'a.
I thought he wanted to know	Inni beekuu barbaada jedheen yaade
I have to go there now	Amma gara sanaa deemuun qaba
Maybe she shouldn't.	Tarii isheen gochuu hin qabdu ta'a.
That is not the case now.	Amma akkas miti.
I just didn’t want that life	Jireenya sana qofa hin barbaanne
It was obvious that he really wanted to go.	Dhuguma deemuu akka barbaadu ifa ture.
It was so bad no one else was outside.	Baayyee hamaa ture namni biraa ala hin turre.
You should have seen what he did yesterday.	Silaa waan kaleessa hojjete arguu qabda turte.
But I think he went away	Inni garuu deeme natti fakkaata
A voice came from above	Sagalee ol irraa dhufe
I don't know how to be.	Akkamitti akkan ta'u hin beeku.
You seem to be there.	Ati waan jirtu fakkaata.
I knew it had to be one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture
Which seems simple enough.	Kan salphaa gahaa fakkaatu.
I have to do what he says	Waan inni jedhu gochuun qaba
I didn't want to be alone again	Ammas kophaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
I mean, it’s nothing but me	Ana malee homaa miti jechuu kooti
These two men had much in common.	Namoonni lamaan kun waan baayʼee wal fakkaatu qabu turan.
I have that issue too.	Anis dhimma sana qaba.
There is one fact.	Dhugaa jiru tokko.
Maybe it's your mother.	Tarii haadha kee ta'uu danda'a.
He is a human being.	Inni nama.
It wasn’t a dog.	Saree hin turre.
I just couldn't not be with her	Ishee waliin ta'uu dhiisuu qofa hin dandeenye
I was very pleased with it.	Ani baay'een itti gammade.
That it shouldn't have had to.	Silaa dirqama ta'uu akka hin qabne.
They had no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban turan.
I wonder why she has two	Maaliif lama qabdi jedheen yaada
I didn't tell him it was all my opinion	Hundi yaada koo akka ta'e itti hin himne
I already had, but I didn’t say anything	Duraan qaba ture, garuu homaa hin dubbanne
I love to work.	Hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
I think that’s great	Sun waan guddaa natti fakkaata
I thought maybe we were more than friends	Tarii hiriyyoota caalaa taane jedheen yaade
Just as simple as that.	Akkuma salphaa sana.
She was just being herself again.	Isheen ammas of ta'uu qofa turte.
He thought of the idea	Yaada sana yaade
We are not one of them.	Nuti isaan keessaa tokko miti.
I want to know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaada.
The man asked why he had done so.	Namni kun sababa akkas godhe gaafate.
We were in the main room.	Kutaa guddaa sana keessa turre.
Someone said it would be a problem.	Namni tokko rakkoo ta'a jedhe.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
But I don't know anything about you	Ani garuu waa'ee kee homaa hin beeku
I don't know of course.	Hin beeku beekamaadha.
It was still true.	Ammas dhugaa ture.
Now they have him.	Amma isa qaban.
Something seems wrong	Waan tokko dogoggora fakkaata
He looks like a bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa fakkaata.
He would have had it.	Silaa qaba ture.
I know what's going to happen	Waan ta'u nan beeka
I didn't know him all that well	Ani akkas hunda isa hin beeku ture
You have to give me that.	Sana naaf kennuu qabda.
I mean, how.	Akkamitti jechuu kooti.
I even hope we don’t meet.	Akka wal hin argine illee abdiin qaba.
I really didn’t know what to do with myself	Dhuguma maal akkan of godhu hin beeku ture
Please help me out.	Mee na gargaaruu qabda.
I want to have something real	Waan dhugaa ta'e qabaachuu nan barbaada
I said it, but it wasn't from me	Anis jedhe malee ana biraa hin turre
I thought it was one of my worst	Hamaa koo keessaa tokko natti fakkaate
Not quite there.	Guutummaatti achi miti.
No one is doing that today.	Har'a namni akkas gochaa jiru hin jiru.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
But maybe that's exactly what it takes.	Garuu tarii sirriitti wanti barbaachisu kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
But not all of them look good.	Hundi isaanii garuu gaarii hin fakkaatu.
He told them all their names	Maqaa isaanii hunda itti hime
Maybe it wasn't.	Tarii hin turre ta'a.
You can't help it.	Gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
If only it would have worked.	Osoo ta'ee qofa hojjechuu qaba ture.
I want your opinion about it	Waa'ee isaa yaada keessan nan barbaada
There is a time.	Yeroon jira.
It's too obvious.	Garmalee ifaadha.
It came in the way after the fact	Dhugaa jiru booda karaa keessa dhufe
He seemed like a nice guy.	Inni nama gaarii fakkaata ture.
I could never do anything like that	Waan akkasii gochuu gonkumaa hin dandeenye
I still don't understand	Ammallee hin hubanne
Of course, everyone knows what this really means.	Kun dhuguma maal akka taʼe namni hundi akka beeku beekamaadha.
I want to say it does, but it doesn't.	Ni jira jechuu barbaada, garuu hin ta'u.
I don't understand why it's so big	Maaliif akkas guddaa akka ta'e naaf hin galle
But he was important.	Garuu inni barbaachisaa ture.
He had nothing but time	Yeroo malee homaa hin qabu ture
But I couldn’t help but comment.	Garuu yaada kennuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
I’m not that girl anymore	Ani kana booda intala sana miti
But it does matter.	Garuu dhimma qaba.
He really shouldn’t have.	Dhuguma qabaachuu hin qabu ture.
He was looking at her	Ishee ilaalaa ture
He didn’t have to do that at all.	Tasumaa akkas gochuun isa hin barbaachifne.
I knew what was coming	Waan dhufu nan beeka ture
It’s nice when it works.	Yeroo hojjetu namatti tola.
But you can't speak.	Garuu dubbachuu hin dandeessu.
It made people different	Namoota adda godhe
I looked at him well	Anis akka gaariitti isa ilaale
There must be something.	Waan tokko jiraachuu qaba.
I couldn't even turn back	Duubatti deebi'uu illee hin dandeenye
This is in error.	Kun dogoggora keessa jira.
It's not perfect, just to be clear.	Inni guutuu miti, ifa ta'uuf qofa.
I absolutely love this issue.	Dhimma kana guutummaatti nan jaalladha.
Often, though, he does not.	Yeroo baayʼee garuu hin godhu.
It's very nice	Baayyee namatti tola
Something happened in that room.	Kutaa sana keessatti wanti tokko ta'e.
I think that's the girl	Intala sun natti fakkaata
I knew what that felt like	Sun maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture
She was absolutely right.	Isheen guutummaatti sirrii turte.
I wouldn't have thought about it	Silaa waa'ee isaa hin yaadu ture
We need that.	Sana nu barbaachisa.
Maybe he just likes cats.	Tarii saree qofa jaallata ta'a.
Now you, of course, don’t need money.	Amma ati, qarshii akka si hin barbaachifne beekamaadha.
No catch had him	Qabduu tokkollee isa hin qabu ture
They really had no idea.	Dhuguma yaada tokkollee hin qaban turan.
I couldn't work enough hours	Sa'aatii gahaa hojjechuu hin dandeenye
I may have been like that before, but not anymore	Ani kanaan dura akkas ta'uu danda'a, garuu kana booda miti
He didn't talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa hin dubbanne.
I thought he was just human	Nama qofa natti fakkaate
I don’t have it, anymore.	Ani hin qabu, kana booda.
I don't know what that means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku.
This is not like a real job.	Kun akka hojii dhugaa miti.
You could have come back.	Silaa deebi'uu dandeessa turte.
He still couldn't speak.	Ammas dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
Nothing is going to happen.	Wanti ta'u hin jiru.
I can't give it to him	Isaaf kennuu hin danda'u
I couldn’t even scream anymore	Kana booda iyyuu hin dandeenye
But not entirely.	Garuu guutummaatti miti.
I could be wrong about this	Kana irratti dogoggora ta'uu danda'a
And I'm going to be different.	Anis adda ta'uuf deema.
It’s not that big of a deal.	Waan hangas guddaa miti.
We are together tonight.	Halkan kana waliin jirra.
Later that morning.	Booda ganama sana.
It's not right.	Sirrii miti.
I couldn't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye.
That’s what happened here.	Sun asitti ta’e.
He still didn't know she was watching him.	Ammallee akka isheen isa ilaalaa jirtu hin beeku ture.
About what he knows.	Waa'ee waan inni beeku.
But he came again.	Garuu ammas dhufe.
I can't help myself	Of gargaaruu hin danda'u
I want to stay here with you	Si waliin as turuu barbaada
I am definitely interested	Fedhii akkan qabu beekamaadha
He obviously isn’t.	Inni akka hin taane ifaadha.
Still no one came for him.	Ammas namni isaaf dhufe hin jiru.
I don't have the right time.	Yeroo sirrii irra hin qabu.
He wants to live a simple life.	Jireenya salphaa jiraachuu barbaada.
He didn’t want to see her again	Ammas ishee arguu hin barbaanne
He loves you.	Inni si jaallata.
I just wanted to be with her.	Ishee waliin ta'uu qofa barbaade.
It wasn’t that easy.	Akkas salphaa hin turre.
I need you to be here for me	Naaf akka as jirtu si barbaachisa
A little something, no big deal	Xiqqoo waan tokko, waan guddaa miti
I can't believe it's him	Isa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
I think everyone should have two	Namni hundi lama qabaachuu qaba jedheen yaada
We wanted something new.	Waan haaraa barbaanne.
She said she couldn't.	Hin danda'u jette.
Sounds that tell you what's what.	Sagalee maal maal akka ta'e sitti himu.
It is certainly not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Talking about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu.
It’s just more than that.	Kana caalaa qofa.
He didn’t do anything like that.	Homaa akkasii hin hojjenne.
I need to know something	Waan tokko beekuu na barbaachisa
I didn’t know what to think.	Maal akka yaadu hin beeku ture.
I know you don't want to see that happen	Akkas akka ta'u arguu akka hin barbaanne nan beeka
But there are.	Garuu ni jiru.
Something that really matters.	Waan dhuguma barbaachisaa ta'e.
He is still there.	Ammallee achi jira.
She was here.	Isheen as turte.
But a lot of things have to happen.	Garuu wanti baay'een ta'uu qaba.
I know both of these people.	Namoota kana lamaan nan beeka.
That can never be the case.	Gonkumaa akkas taʼuu hin dandaʼu.
I can't be on the road	Karaa irra jiraachuu hin danda'u
I could not have been more helpful.	Kana caalaa gargaaruu hin dandaʼu ture.
He had no idea where he was going, or why.	Eessa akka deemu, maaliif akka deemu yaada hin qabu ture.
I wanted no part of it	Kutaa isaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
I’m just unlucky	Ani nama carraa hin qabne qofa
I should never have left her	Silaa gonkumaa ishee dhiisuu hin qabu ture
They’re not the only ones.	Isaan qofa miti.
It’s not really their thing, not entirely.	Dhuguma waan isaanii miti, guutummaatti miti.
It is possible, however.	Ni danda'ama garuu.
He was still your father.	Ammallee abbaa kee ture.
He was very lucky.	Baay'ee carraa qaba ture.
But that was really good for me	Garuu sun dhuguma naaf gaarii ture
Just playing with her	Ishee waliin taphachuu qofa
So this is not right.	Kanaaf kun sirrii miti.
I didn’t know who was watching us, or how	Eenyu akka nu ilaalaa jiru, akkamitti akka nu ilaalaa jiru hin beeku ture
So he was there.	Kanaaf achi ture.
But it wouldn’t help.	Garuu hin gargaaru ture.
I couldn’t find the question	Gaaffii sana argachuu hin dandeenye
Everything is fine.	Hundi gaarii dha.
Someone else, someone else.	Nama biraa, nama biraa.
I just need to know what you said.	Waan ati jette beekuu qofa na barbaachisa.
I wasn't sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
What she was doing.	Waan isheen hojjechaa turte.
He looks like this .	Inni akkas fakkaata .
But it didn’t last long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
Important work.	Hojii barbaachisaa.
I just can't believe she's gone	Isheen akka hin jirre qofa amanuu hin danda'u
I told him everything, even a little bit	Waan hundumaa, xiqqoo illee itti hime
Maybe two parts.	Tarii kutaa lama ta'uu danda'a.
I wish it were otherwise.	Osoo akkas ta'ee gaarii ture.
This is still possible.	Kun ammallee ni danda'ama.
Another was obvious.	Kan biraa ifa ture.
I didn’t see a car the whole way here	Karaa guutuu asitti konkolaataa tokko hin argine
I wanted to forgive you yesterday	Kaleessa dhiifama siif gochuu barbaade
None of it matters anymore.	Kana booda tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
Look at this one.	Isa kana ilaalaa.
I would have gone	Silaa nan deema ture
You don’t like them.	Isaan hin jaallattu.
She was exactly the right person	Isheen sirriitti nama sirrii turte
I already knew him well.	Duraan akka gaariitti isa beeka ture.
I didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
It didn't look like much.	Baay'ee hin fakkaatu ture.
It seemed easy.	Salphaa fakkaata ture.
I didn’t want her to leave, not yet	Akka isheen deemtu hin barbaanne, ammallee miti
It wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa hin turre.
Really glad to be here	Dhuguma as jiraachuu kootti gammadeera
I'm trying not to say too much	Baay'ee akkan hin dubbanne yaalaa jira
I can tell you have it bad	Hamaa akka qabdu sitti himuu nan danda'a
Only a couple of hours.	Sa'aatii lama lama qofa.
In this case,.	Haala kana keessatti,.
I wasn't sure then	Yeroo sana mirkanaa'aa hin turre
But not to that extent .	Garuu hanga sanatti miti .
I didn't really know him very well	Dhuguma baay'ee isa hin beeku ture
Night, after night, after night.	Halkan, halkan booda, halkan booda.
We are expecting new things.	Wantoota haaraa eegaa jirra.
It seemed like a good idea.	Yaada gaarii fakkaata ture.
Hope this helps someone else.	Kun nama biraa akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
But then I really thought that was just one episode.	Garuu sana booda dhuguma sun kutaa tokko qofa jedhee yaade.
They will help you there.	Achitti si gargaaru.
These were older children.	Isaan kun ijoollee umuriin isaanii guddaa taʼe turan.
Not everyone knows everything about everything.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa namni hundi waan hunda hin beeku.
Everything else works.	Wanti biraa hundi ni hojjeta.
I shouldn't be.	Ani ta'uu hin qabu.
He would say they needed that much.	Hanga sanaa isaan barbaachisa jedha ture.
I was just looking at it this morning	Ganama kana qofa ilaalaa ture
Therein lies the problem.	Sana keessaa rakkoon jira.
But now neither of them were there.	Garuu amma isaan lamaan achi hin turre.
We were all there.	Hundi keenya turre.
He was just a guy with an idea.	Gurbaa yaada qabu tokko qofa ture.
I've never been with them	Isaan waliin ta'ee hin beeku
All in one year.	Hundi waggaa tokko keessatti.
Not too sure about anything else	Waan biraa irratti garmalee mirkanaa'aa miti
I can’t seem to do any better now.	Amma kana caalaa hojjechuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
I won't say more	Kana caalaa hin jedhu
I don't have much anymore.	Kana booda baay'ee hin qabu.
Maybe it's the real thing.	Tarii waan dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
I wanted to tell you something	Waan tokko sitti himuu barbaade
It is still clear outside.	Ammas ala ifaadha.
But they had to do something.	Garuu waan tokko gochuu qabu turan.
But it’s okay, it’s no big deal.	Garuu homaa miti, waan guddaa miti.
I knew what was the right thing to do.	Wanti sirrii taʼe maal akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
Of course, I could be completely wrong.	Guutummaatti dogoggora taʼuu akkan dandaʼu beekamaadha.
But it wasn’t the right answer.	Garuu deebii sirrii hin turre.
I like the simplicity.	Salphaa natti tola.
He had to work on that sort of thing.	Waan akkasii irratti hojjechuu qaba ture.
A man of money.	Nama qarshii.
But we don't have time.	Garuu yeroo hin qabnu.
I can't find a good way to do this though	Kana gochuuf karaa gaarii ta'e garuu argachuu hin danda'u
But he was on his way.	Inni garuu karaa irra ture.
Everything is our problem.	Wanti hundi rakkoo keenya.
Being out here.	As ala ta'uu.
Very good times, very very good times.	Yeroo baayyee gaarii, yeroo baayyee baayyee gaarii.
I had my life together	Jireenya koo waliin qaba ture
Everything is fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii dha.
I can't find any way to do this.	Karaa kana itti godhu tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u.
I know this is bad	Kun hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka
That came very quickly.	Sun baayyee dafee dhufe.
He seemed to know everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hunda waan beeku fakkaata ture.
I was very happy for him	Isaaf baay'een gammade
I still can't be working.	Ammallee hojjechaa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
I thought everyone wasn’t	Namni hundi hin turre jedheen yaade
You have to help him.	Isa gargaaruu qabda.
Two weeks is a long time.	Torban lama yeroo dheeraa dha.
Not everyone knows this.	Kana namni hundi hin beeku.
I haven’t been doing this my whole life	Jireenya koo guutuu kana gochaa hin turre
Glad to see this	Kana arguu kootti gammadeera
This was not necessarily so.	Kun dirqama akkas hin turre.
But one has to go further.	Garuu namni tokko kana caalaa deemuu qaba.
I could have gone there	Silaa achi deemuun nan dandaʼa ture
It is a time of questioning.	Yeroo gaaffii dha.
I didn’t really want to live anymore	Kana booda dhuguma jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I still don't understand.	Ammallee hin hubanne.
Not after the day she had.	Guyyaa isheen qabdu booda miti.
All he knows is the language of money.	Wanti inni beeku afaan qarshii qofa.
I want it to be true	Dhugaa akka ta'u nan barbaada
You know what that does to me.	Sun maal akka na godhu beekta.
This is obvious.	Kun ifaadha.
I told him we did.	Akkas goone jedheen itti hime.
I mean, you.	Ati jechuu kooti.
I still don’t know what that means	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta’e ammallee hin beeku
I still don't understand	Ammallee hin hubanne
What's in it today?.	Har'a keessa maaltu jira?.
I didn’t even care anymore	Kana booda dhimma illee hin qabu ture
I was with them for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan waliin ture.
But it wasn’t clear.	Garuu ifa hin turre.
I thought they knew my father	Abbaa koo ni beeku jedheen yaade
Must be a good time!.	Yeroo gaarii ta'uu qaba!.
I mean, he really loves me	Dhuguma na jaallata jechuu kooti
I wasn’t here tonight.	Halkan kana as hin turre.
He needs help.	Gargaarsa isa barbaachisa.
They have the facts.	Dhugaa jiru qabu.
It will always be good for you	Yeroo hundumaa gaarii siif ta'a
He gave that night to the spot.	Halkan sana bakka sanatti kenne.
I just need to give it some time	Yeroo muraasa kennuu qofa na barbaachisa
It had taken me a while.	Yeroo natti fudhate ture.
Not only that, but nothing has ever gone wrong with this car.	Kana qofa osoo hin taane konkolaataa kana irratti wanti dogoggora ta'ee hin beeku.
I know it wasn’t like this before	Kanaan dura akkasitti akka hin turre nan beeka
I think something is going to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf jira jedheen yaada.
I don’t want to see them anymore.	Kana booda isaan arguu hin barbaadu.
That's all it can be.	Kana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
He said there wasn't.	Hin jiru jedhe.
You would never know.	Silaa gonkumaa hin beektu turte.
It couldn't be clearer	Kana caalaa ifa ta'uu hin danda'u
I usually liked it	Yeroo baayʼee natti tola ture
One of us has to go.	Tokko keenya deemuu qaba.
He had many friends around him.	Hiriyyoota hedduu naannoo isaa qaba ture.
They work very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjetu.
Not the same girl.	Intala tokko miti.
. . . .	.
That wouldn’t have occurred to me.	Silaa sun natti hin dhufu ture.
He should have apologized	Dhiifama gaafachuu qaba ture
I was doing exactly the same thing.	Anis sirriitti kanuma hojjechaa ture.
Maybe it’s the part that doesn’t have the most.	Tarii kutaa hunda caalaa hin qabne ta’uu danda’a.
I know you stayed with me almost all night	Halkan guutuu jechuun ni danda'ama akka na bira turte nan beeka
We had the light.	Ifa qabna turre.
But that’s not why.	Garuu kanaaf miti.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
I think he's just so happy now	Amma baay'ee gammade qofa natti fakkaata
I don't know anyone like that.	Nama akkasii hin beeku.
I like it very much.	Baayyee natti tola.
Very nice environment.	Naannoo baayyee namatti tola.
I know all about your guys	Waa'ee gurbaa kee hunda nan beeka
We didn’t do anything, we didn’t do anything.	Homaa hin hojjenne, homaa hin hojjenne.
I wouldn’t have hesitated.	Silaa duubatti hin jedhu ture.
They are .	Isaan ... dha .
He came with them.	Isaan waliin dhufe.
I knew nothing about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku ture
That stuff is important.	Wanti sun barbaachisaa dha.
It was a great idea	Yaada guddaa ture
I would have said he was absolutely right	Silaa guutummaatti sirrii dha jedheen ture
There is no one.	Namni tokkollee hin jiru.
From the inside.	Keessaa irraa.
Now we were in it together.	Amma waliin keessa turre.
I knew nothing about comedy	Waa'ee qoosaa homaa hin beeku ture
He wanted to tell about her	Waa'ee ishee himuu barbaade
If so, you are in for a lot of work.	Yoo ta'e hojii baay'ee keessa jirta.
I really love it so much	Dhuguma baay'een jaalladha
I can't be this person	Ani nama kana ta'uu hin danda'u
I wondered how that could happen	Akkamitti akkas taʼuu dandaʼa jedheen yaade
They were there all night.	Halkan guutuu achi turan.
But it can only be true up to a point.	Garuu hanga tokko qofa dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
They were new at the time.	Yeroo sanatti isaan haaraa turan.
I like it very much.	Baayyee natti tola.
We weren’t one for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf tokko hin turre.
I had no idea then	Yeroo sanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
Couldn’t do anything about that	Sana irratti homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
No one there wants to see you now.	Namni achi jiru amma si arguu hin barbaadu.
I think you should know	Beektu ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
He did a very good job.	Hojii baayyee gaarii hojjete.
On the way.	Karaa irratti.
She still doesn't like it.	Ammas hin jaallattu.
But it is not perfect well.	Garuu akka gaariitti guutuu miti.
Can anyone help me please.	Namni na gargaaru jiraa maaloo.
They can even ask.	Gaafachuu illee ni danda’u.
But that’s not a huge problem.	Garuu sun rakkoo guddaa miti.
I couldn’t live here anymore	Kana booda as jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I can't go back now	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
I can't believe this is happening	Kun ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
In the old days, we.	Bara durii, nuti.
It was really bad.	Dhuguma hamaa ture.
The guy who was with me last night.	Gurbaa kaleessa halkan na waliin ture.
This is not right	Kun sirrii miti
It's probably going to be good.	Gaarii ta'uu hin oolu.
I think she’s right	Isheen sirrii natti fakkaata
I wondered what he thought about all this	Waa'ee kana hunda maal akka yaadu natti fakkaate
I won’t tell him what you did	Waan ati goote itti hin himu
Then there was nothing again.	Sana booda ammas homaa hin turre.
It worked so well.	Akka malee hojjete.
This shouldn't be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu.
It does work.	Ni hojjeta.
I need him desperately.	Inni baayʼee na barbaachisa.
I will never forgive you	Yoomiyyuu dhiifama siif hin godhu
Two become one.	Lama tokko ta’u.
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo miti.
That was what he wanted.	Kan inni barbaade kanuma ture.
I love it so much.	Baay'een jaalladha.
I thought he wanted to tell me something, but he couldn’t	Waan tokko natti himuu barbaada jedheen yaade, garuu hin dandeenye
But it was her.	Garuu ishee ture.
It worked very well.	Baayyee hojjete.
It doesn't matter if it started right on their watch or before.	Sirriitti sa'aatii isaanii irratti jalqabe moo duraan homaa hin qabu.
He wants to be good	Gaarii ta'uu barbaada
I didn't know what was going on anymore	Kana booda waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
First, I have a few questions	Dura gaaffii muraasa qaba
So far.	Hanga ammaatti.
I didn’t know how to do that.	Akkamitti akkas godhu hin beeku ture.
She wasn’t going to leave.	Isheen deemuuf hin turre.
I wonder how it works	Akkamitti hojjeta jedheen yaada
This thing really exists.	Wanti kun dhuguma jira.
I've never been wrong about that though	Ani garuu waa'ee sanaa dogoggora jedhee hin beeku
He doesn't like to talk to me about stuff like that.	Waa'ee waan akkasii natti dubbachuu hin jaallatu.
But now we have to do something else.	Garuu amma waan biraa hojjechuu qabna.
It was a dog.	Saree ture.
But this was something completely different.	Garuu kun waan guutummaatti adda ture.
I can't help him now	Amma isa gargaaruu hin danda'u
I want to see it and feel it.	Arguu fi miira qabaachuu nan barbaada.
They like to drink.	Dhugaatii ni jaallatu.
I don’t know what to do after that.	Sana booda maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I don't like anyone else	Kan biraa hin jaalladhu
Knowing that it is.	Akka ta'e beekuu.
She didn’t know these people.	Namoota kana hin beektu turte.
But it wasn’t her.	Garuu ishee hin turre.
That has never happened before.	Kana dura akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
Not anymore, he says.	Kana booda miti jedha.
I know the present and the past	Kan ammaa fi kan darbe nan beeka
I would have known nothing.	Silaa homaa hin beeku ture.
I still have both cars.	Ammallee konkolaataa lamaan qaba.
I really couldn’t.	Dhuguma hin dandeenye.
You're not sure.	Ati mirkanaa'aa miti.
I didn’t think it was that bad	Hamma kana hamaa ture natti hin fakkaatu ture
I mean, maybe we shouldn’t	Tarii gochuu hin qabnu jechuu kooti
He wants that girl.	Intala sana barbaada.
There are people here.	Namoonni as jiru.
Your mother.	Haadha kee.
He was about to do something terrible.	Waan hamaa hojjechuuf jedha ture.
A place of no hope	Bakka abdii hin qabne
If it had been.	Yoo ta'ee ture.
The reason for this is obvious.	Sababni kanaa ifaadha.
Maybe we shouldn't.	Tarii nuti gochuu hin qabnu ta'a.
I was wrong was wrong.	Ani dogoggora ture dogoggora ture.
That doesn't mean we won't.	Hin goonu jechuu miti.
I have no idea what happened	Waan ta'e yaada hin qabu
I am so good at it.	Ani akkas gaarii dha.
I want it in your room	Kutaa kee keessa nan barbaada
Two are not one.	Lama tokko miti.
I came right up.	Ani sirriitti ol dhufe.
Perhaps that is the case.	Tarii akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
I want him to go away	Akka inni biraa deemu nan barbaada
Everything seems fine.	Wanti hundi waan gaarii fakkaata.
So what you said didn't work.	Kanaaf wanti ati jette hin hojjenne.
But I couldn't see it	Ani garuu arguu hin dandeenye
He got a chance.	Carraa argate.
And I wasn’t even around when he was	Anis yeroo inni ture sanatti illee hin turre
It’s a life.	Jireenya dha.
I like this guy right now	Gurbaa kana yeroo ammaa kana natti tola
I am somewhere else.	Ani bakka biraa jira.
It seems like a good thing.	Waan gaarii fakkaata.
I don't know why.	Maaliif hin beeku.
You are now one of us.	Ati amma nu keessaa tokko taate.
He was trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa ture.
But he would if he wanted to.	Garuu osoo barbaade ni godha ture.
I wondered what else he knew	Kan biraa maal beeka jedheen yaade
Something was very wrong.	Wanti tokko baay'ee dogoggora ture.
She was not what he wanted.	Isheen waan inni barbaadu hin turre.
She said that one day.	Guyyaa tokko akkas jettee turte.
I didn’t need that light	Ifa sana na hin barbaachifne
I was hopeless, hopeless	Ani abdii malee, abdii malee ture
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
We have to see it.	Arguu qabna.
They have a job.	Hojii qabu.
You're waiting up here.	Asitti ol eegaa jirta.
The reason seems obvious.	Sababni isaa ifa fakkaata.
A little thing.	Waan xiqqoo.
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
All for him.	Hundi isaaf.
That's when it got really bad.	Yeroo sanatti dhuguma hamaa ta'e.
Funny there.	Qoosaa achitti.
We really had it both ways	Dhuguma karaa lamaan qabna turre
I couldn’t do my job	Hojii koo hojjechuu hin dandeenye
I just didn't want to talk about that	Waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu qofa hin barbaanne
I have to do that.	Ani akkas gochuun qaba.
I know that’s not the case	Akkas akka hin taane nan beeka
I saw two outside not a while ago	Yeroo muraasa dura osoo hin taane ala lama arge
I really didn’t want to go	Dhuguma deemuu hin barbaanne
I thought you were gone	Ati waan hin jirre natti fakkaate
But I don't have anyone else	Ani garuu nama biraa hin qabu
I saw him at the party	Affeerraa sanatti isa arge
People knew this.	Namoonni kana ni beeku turan.
This was once a home.	Kun yeroo tokko mana ture.
I know exactly what that feels like	Sun maal akka fakkaatu sirriitti beeka
Until now, perhaps.	Hanga ammaatti tarii.
Everyone enjoyed the house.	Namni hundi mana sanatti gammade.
I need a few.	Muraasa na barbaachisa.
I think that’s another thing	Sun waan biraa natti fakkaata
He knew exactly where he was going	Eessa akka deemu sirriitti beeka ture
I didn’t see him in the car	Konkolaataa keessaa isa hin argine
Something no one can really tell.	Waan dhuguma namni tokkollee himuu hin dandeenye.
I have a lot going on with you.	Waan baay'ee isin waliin deemaa jira.
We are going to work together.	Waliin hojjechuuf jirra.
Maybe he had his reasons.	Tarii sababa isaa qaba ture ta'a.
Maybe I love her too much	Tarii garmalee ishee jaalladha
Of who, what and why.	Kan eenyu, maal fi maaliif.
That time has passed.	Yeroon sun darbe.
I can't talk about it anymore	Kana booda waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
I didn’t understand that at the time	Yeroo sanatti akkas naaf hin galle ture
Really, really good job.	Hojii dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii.
I still have all my issues.	Ammallee dhimma koo hunda qaba.
He had to do this.	Kana gochuu qaba ture.
She said good good.	Gaarii gaarii jette.
Everyone wants something.	Namni hundi waan barbaada.
He had us.	Inni nu qaba ture.
Then he spoke again.	Sana booda ammas dubbate.
It doesn’t do it for me.	Naaf hin godhu.
I have a little problem.	Rakkoo xiqqoo qaba.
I didn't want to talk about her	Waa'ee ishee dubbachuu hin barbaanne
I know the area a lot better than you do	Naannoo sana baay'ee si caalaa beeka
You have to have people.	Namoota qabaachuu qabda.
I have them, theirs	Ani isaan qaba, kan isaanii
But he seemed like such a great guy.	Garuu gurbaa guddaa akkasii fakkaata ture.
They are, however, by no means the complete picture.	Isaan garuu tasumaa suuraa guutuu miti.
I don't want to talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
I know now that this will never work	Kun gonkumaa akka hin hojjenne amma beeka
This shouldn’t be the case.	Kun ta’uu hin qabu.
I couldn’t tell him anything	Homaa itti himuu hin dandeenye
They need that.	Sana isaan barbaachisa.
It may be among those who do not have it.	Kan hin qabne keessaa ta’uu danda’a.
I knew then, in that moment, that we were together	Yeroo sanatti, yeroo sanatti, akka waliin taane beeka ture
That's what I think	Kanuma jedheen yaada
I can't be of any help to you	Ani gargaarsa tokkollee siif ta'uu hin danda'u
He just wants him to know that something will happen.	Waan tokko akka ta'u qofa akka beeku barbaada.
I couldn't say anything	Homaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye
I want this place.	Bakka kana barbaada.
There was only one possibility.	Carraan tokko qofa ture.
He didn’t do anything else	Waan biraa hin hojjenne
But nothing was as bad as this.	Garuu wanti akka kanaa hamaa ta'e hin turre.
They know you are not one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko akka hin taane ni beeku.
I want to know what happened.	Waan ta'e beekuu barbaada.
It is in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jira.
They never have it.	Gonkumaa hin qaban.
As we did.	Akkuma goone.
I knew she wasn’t in the mood	Miira keessa akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
I didn’t think anything of it.	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne.
I don't think it's good.	Akka kootti gaarii miti.
He would have had nothing	Silaa homaa hin qabu ture
They were great.	Isaan guddaa turan.
Then it does exactly the same thing.	Sana booda sirriitti kanuma hojjeta.
You have to make it the easy way to go.	Karaa salphaa itti deemtu gochuu qabda.
She had to live.	Jiraachuu qabdi turte.
Without him she had nothing.	Isa malee homaa hin qabdu turte.
That's not going to happen.	Sun ta'uuf hin deemu.
You are not a bad person.	Ati nama hamaa miti.
But he was happy.	Inni garuu gammade.
Not sure why	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti
I didn’t want a teacher	Ani barsiisaa hin barbaanne
I want to know more about it	Waa'ee isaa caalaatti beekuu barbaada
That's right.	Sun sirrii dha.
I couldn’t find any.	Tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
It was a name.	Maqaa ture.
He had a good job.	Hojii gaarii qaba ture.
But it works now.	Garuu amma ni hojjeta.
I have to say it really does the job well	Dhuguma hojii sana akka gaariitti hojjeta jechuun qaba
You can be better than this girl.	Intala kana caalaa ta'uu dandeessu.
I could never ask her.	Gonkumaa ishee gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
I was just trying to help	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa ture
I didn’t think she knew we were watching	Akka ilaalaa turre waan beektu natti hin fakkaatu ture
Now that’s just ridiculous.	Amma sun qoosaa qofa.
I don’t have time right now	Yeroo ammaa kana yeroo hin qabu
You're not here.	Ati as hin jirtu.
You can not	Hin dandeessu .
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
he had to have.	qabaachuu qaba ture.
I didn’t know the gentleman	Ani nama gaarii sana hin beeku ture
I definitely don’t want to walk on you	Si irra deemuu akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha
I think this is different	Kun adda natti fakkaata
I think you already know this	Kana duruu beektu jedheen yaada
She is not the only one of them.	Isaan keessaa ishee qofa miti.
Looks like he wanted more.	Kana caalaa barbaade fakkaata.
It says things like why	Waan akka maaliif jedha
It wasn’t what he needed.	Waan isa barbaachisu hin turre.
He was only there a few times though.	Yeroo muraasa qofa achi ture garuu.
It still doesn’t exist.	Ammas hin jiru.
You can do two things.	Waan lama gochuu dandeessu.
I need to do this, I always have	Kana gochuun na barbaachisa, yeroo hundumaa qaba
Which is important.	Kan barbaachisaa ta'e.
I knew the real reason	Sababni isaa isa dhugaa nan beeka ture
A fact, if not obvious	Dhugaa tokko, yoo ifa hin taane
Only two problems.	Rakkoo lama qofa.
So expect a lot.	Kanaaf waan baay'ee eegaa.
A couple of times, maybe	Yeroo lama lama, tarii
Everything has its place.	Wanti hundi bakka isaa qaba.
I can't really see them	Dhuguma isaan arguu hin danda'u
Not sure about that.	Sana irratti mirkanaa'aa miti.
The work is there.	Hojiin achi jira.
I hoped she had enough sense	Miira gahaa akka qabdu abdiin qaba ture
It was clear from her voice that something was wrong.	Sagalee ishee irraa wanti tokko dogoggora akka ta'e ifa ture.
I can ask you.	gaafachuu nan danda'a.
But he knows that’s not the case anymore.	Garuu kana booda akkas akka hin taane beeka.
He already knew.	Inni duruu beeka ture.
We had a house.	Mana qabna turre.
They were good.	Isaan gaarii turan.
A reality we all have to live with	Dhugaa hundi keenya waliin jiraachuu qabnu
There's no reason she should be.	Sababni isheen ta'uu qabdu hin jiru.
Which sometimes happens.	Kan yeroo tokko tokko ta'u.
Then another two.	Sana booda lama kan biraa.
I know why you want me	Maaliif akka na barbaaddu nan beeka
I told him it was fine	Anis gaarii akka ta'e itti hime
He started doing that	Akkas gochuu jalqabe
I think it would be a great, great thing.	Waan guddaa, guddaa ta'a jedheen yaada.
This doesn’t work at all.	Kun tasumaa hin hojjetu.
I knew he was right then	Yeroo sanatti sirrii akka ta'e nan beeka ture
Perhaps the most important thing in our lives.	Tarii jireenya keenya keessatti wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe taʼuu dandaʼa.
We did a really good job of that.	Sana dhuguma hojii gaarii hojjenne.
Everyone has one.	Namni hundi tokko qaba.
I thought you would like them	Isaan ni jaallattu jedheen yaade
It was a good question.	Gaaffii gaarii ture.
It just wouldn't have worked.	Silaa qofa hin hojjetu ture.
Walking at night.	Halkan deemuu.
She was my mother.	Haadha koo turte.
I want to say you can but you can’t.	Ni dandeessu jechuu barbaada garuu hin dandeessu.
That she was so lonely.	Akka malee kophaa ishee akka turte.
He never knew his father.	Abbaa isaa gonkumaa hin beeku.
Month.	Ji'a.
I say a lot, but not a lot	Baay'een jedha malee baay'ee miti
There is a chance	Carraan jira
Maybe that's what it is.	Tarii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
I have to do something that helps	Waan gargaaru gochuun qaba
I didn't think much of it at the time	Yeroo sanatti baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I'm right.	Ani sirrii dha.
Not to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uuf miti.
Now? 	Amma?
I have no idea.	Yaada hin qabu.
It seemed like a timeless week.	Torban yeroo hin qabne fakkaata ture.
I wish we had thought of this a long time ago.	Osoo yeroo dheeraa dura kana yaadne ta'ee natti tola.
I love giving and receiving them	Isaan kennuu fi argachuu nan jaalladha
A little bit more.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo caalaa.
I used to joke with him	Duraan isa waliin qoosaa ture
I want you inside me.	Keessa kootti si barbaada.
I think it’s a great, simple idea.	Yaada guddaa, salphaa natti fakkaata.
But it may not be.	Garuu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Things were very wrong here.	Asitti wanti baay'ee dogoggora ture.
I know it's something	Waan tokko akka ta'e nan beeka
I like that, if anything	Sana natti tola, yoo wanti tokko ta'e
I was expecting this.	Kana eegaa ture.
But you’re not there.	Garuu ati hin jirtu.
I want you in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti si barbaada
Better be anywhere but here.	As malee bakka biraa ta'uu wayya.
I have no help for you now	Ani amma siif gargaarsa hin qabu
I certainly don’t want to.	Akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
I love my old school	Mana barumsaa koo isa durii nan jaalladha
We had enough of us.	Nu gahaa qabna turre.
I went to my side.	Anis gara kootti deeme.
You probably know.	Ati beekta ta'a.
I don't know about anything anymore.	Kana booda waa'ee homaa hin beeku.
I still have them so far.	Ammallee hanga ammaatti isaan qaba.
It’s not a book.	Kitaaba miti.
I know you have to do this	Kana gochuu akka qabdu nan beeka
How do you do this.	Akkamitti kana gootu.
I am not a mother.	Ani haadha miti.
I wondered if he was still there	Ammas achi jiraa jedheen yaade
No watch, looked around the bar	Sa'aatii hin qabu, naannoo mana dhugaatii ilaale
It wasn’t one of those things he had to answer for.	Waan deebii kennuu qabu keessaa tokko hin turre.
One can never see the whole picture	Namni tokko suuraa guutuu gonkumaa arguu hin danda'u
One is not required.	Tokko hin barbaachisu.
She was in a very bad joke.	Qoosaa baayyee hamaa keessa turte.
He has the money.	Maallaqa qaba.
It doesn't go that far.	Hanga kana hin deemu.
I didn’t want to have it with someone	Nama tokko waliin qabaachuu hin barbaanne
That's a possibility.	Sun ta'uu danda'a.
I told him everything	Waan hundumaa itti hime
I was a big dog in that one.	Ani isa sana keessatti saree guddaa ture.
They are not needed.	Isaan hin barbaachisu.
I was never going to be with a girl	Ani gonkumaa intala tokko waliin ta'uuf hin turre
I know how that works	Sun akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka
I couldn’t say my name	Maqaa koo dubbachuu hin dandeenye
I always loved that house	Yeroo hundumaa mana sana nan jaalladha ture
I’m not saying that, you know	Akkas jechuu koo miti, beekta
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
He’s doing better, you know.	Inni kana caalaa hojjechaa jira, beekta.
Tell me you love me.	Na jaallattu natti himi.
You need to know the truth.	Dhugaa beekuu qabda.
She has everything she needs.	Waan ishee barbaachisu hunda qabdi.
But it is necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa dha.
I can't go back again.	Ammas duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
There is one problem though.	Rakkoon tokko garuu jira.
That was the case in my case.	Dhimma koo irratti akkas ture.
I think he always knew the answer	Deebii isaa yeroo hundumaa waan beeku natti fakkaata
They had many problems.	Rakkoo hedduu qaban turan.
I just didn’t think about it	Ani garuu itti hin yaadne qofa
He wasn’t really there	Dhuguma achi hin turre
A lot of people do.	Namoonni baay'een ni godhu.
I had to go with them	Isaan waliin deemuun qaba ture
You couldn’t stay with me.	Ati na bira turuu hin dandeenye.
It should be up.	Ol ta'uu qaba.
I was there, that day	Ani achi ture, guyyaa sana
Just one little thing.	Waan xiqqoo tokko qofa.
She was waiting at my house.	Mana kootti eegaa turte.
So he was always there.	Kanaaf yoomiyyuu achi ture.
That would have been the case.	Silaa akkas ta'a ture.
The work maybe.	Hojiin tarii.
I think you always have this in you	Yeroo hundumaa kana keessa qabda natti fakkaata
He has that.	Sana qaba.
I thought you might be	Ati ta'uu dandeessa jedheen yaade
He went away with nothing.	Homaa tokko malee deeme.
He was just a guy.	Inni gurbaa qofa ture.
I won't say it anymore.	Kana booda hin jedhu.
He had friends, but no real friends	Hiriyyoota qaba ture, garuu hiriyyoota dhugaa hin qabu ture
But you can’t stay outside anymore.	Garuu kana booda ala turuu hin dandeessu.
It just really wasn’t there	Dhuguma qofa achi hin turre
I have only one question.	Gaaffii tokko qofa qaba.
I have no hope of doing anything good	Ani waan gaarii hojjechuuf abdii hin qabu
It was nothing to him.	Homaa isaaf hin turre.
He was the only guy there.	Gurbaa achi ture isa qofa ture.
I was a very, very, very bad boy	Ani gurbaa baayyee baayyee baayyee hamaa ture
I don't understand.	Naaf hin galle.
He knew this one well	Isa kana sirriitti beeka ture
For a few weeks.	Torban muraasaaf.
He is good with people.	Namoota waliin gaarii dha.
But there was no problem.	Garuu rakkoon hin turre.
In this case, and.	Haala kana keessatti, fi.
But that’s just me.	Garuu sun ana qofa.
I can't believe there's no hope for him	Abdiin isaaf hin jiru jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
In a situation such as he is.	Haala akka inni keessa jiru keessatti.
I just can't have this	Ani kana qabaachuu qofa hin danda'u
I am not a bad person	Ani nama hamaa miti
I like it so much now!	Amma baay'ee natti tola!
It’s better to give up.	Harka kennuu wayya.
I didn’t think about it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf itti hin yaadne.
I want to know you and trust you	Si beekuu fi si amanuu barbaada
But he didn't think he could.	Garuu waan danda'u jedhee hin yaadne.
I have nowhere else to go	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin qabu
He wouldn't have been able to	Silaa hin danda'u ture
That’s just my opinion though.	Sun garuu yaada koo qofa.
Two whole weeks.	Torban lama guutuu.
I don’t think anyone really knows.	Dhuguma namni beeku natti hin fakkaatu.
The worst of it.	Kan hamaa.
The most important one is our mother.	Inni hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e haadha keenya.
Now, this is not true.	Amma, kun dhugaa miti.
No one else does.	Namni biraa hin godhu.
This was true.	Kun dhugaa ture.
Not the same people though.	Namoota tokko miti garuu.
They knew where he was going.	Eessa akka deemu beeku turan.
As good as it is.	Akkuma gaarii yoo ta'e.
Just a couple of questions.	Gaaffii tokko lama qofa.
I'm not going with you.	Ani si waliin hin deemu.
They know what’s real.	Waan dhugaa ta’e ni beeku.
He has to work with it.	Itti waliin hojjechuu qaba.
A little longer perhaps, but still pretty much the same	Xiqqoo dheeraa tarii, garuu ammas baay'ee wal fakkaata
I might have someone in there tomorrow	Boru nama tokko achi keessaa qabaachuu nan danda'a
It can't work for you	Siif hojjechuu hin danda'u
I can do this now	Kana amma danda'a
He knew it could be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu akka danda'u beeka ture.
Now he had him.	Amma isa qaba ture.
When she was with me it was different, better	Yeroo isheen na waliin turte adda ture, wayya
He absolutely does.	Inni guutummaatti ni godha.
I didn't know he was your teacher	Barsiisaa kee ta'uu isaa hin beeku ture
When everything is too much.	Yeroo wanti hundi garmalee ta'u.
I’m in it, now.	Ani keessa jira, amma.
I want to be clear about that.	Waa'ee sanaa ifa ta'uu barbaada.
One week is right	Torban tokko sirrii dha
Out of the past.	Waan darbe keessaa ba'e.
We have to leave it there	Achitti dhiisuu qabna
I didn’t want a drink	Dhugaatii hin barbaanne
Those aren’t real problems.	Isaan sun rakkoo dhugaa miti.
Maybe he wasn't.	Tarii inni hin turre ta'a.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that	Xiqqoo kana, xiqqoo sana
He had to, he says here that he did.	Inni dirqama ture, akka inni godhe asitti dubbata.
Still, nothing is quite right.	Ammas ta’ee, wanti guutummaatti sirrii ta’e hin jiru.
I really don't know what's going to happen.	Dhuguma waan ta'uuf jiru hin beeku.
They’re all in a room together, all alone.	Hundi isaanii kutaa tokko keessatti waliin jiru, hundi isaanii kophaa isaanii.
He had no time for this nonsense	Waan hin taane kanaaf yeroo hin qabu ture
Again he said nothing.	Ammas homaa hin dubbanne.
It’s just fine with who we are.	Eenyu akka taane gaarii qofa.
So it works.	Kanaaf ni hojjeta.
This may be the most unique aspect of the job.	Kun wanta hojii sanaa hunda caalaa adda taʼe taʼuu dandaʼa.
It was all your father.	Hundi isaa abbaa kee ture.
I still had no idea who she was.	Ammallee eenyu akka taate yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I just can't help myself	Of gargaaruu qofa hin danda'u
Maybe, I think it should be too much	Tarii, garmalee ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
That can only mean good things.	Sun waan gaarii qofa jechuu danda’a.
But he never does.	Garuu gonkumaa hin godhu.
You can give up.	Harka kennuu dandeessa.
I hadn’t really thought about it.	Dhuguma itti hin yaadne ture.
We can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
I wonder why this started to become a problem	Kun maaliif rakkoo ta'uu jalqabe jedheen yaada
It's just the language.	Afaan qofa.
It was exactly what needed to happen.	Sirriitti waan ta'uu qabu ture.
I wasn't sure how to handle this.	Kana akkamitti akkan danda'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
She would never have wanted this.	Silaa kana gonkumaa hin barbaaddu ture.
Look at you guys.	Isin ilaalaa.
No one did anything.	Namni waan tokko hojjete hin jiru.
I wish someone would say more.	Namni tokko kana caalaa yoo dubbate natti tola.
People know about it.	Namoonni waa'ee isaa ni beeku.
We were all there.	Hundi keenya turre.
I want to know what that is	Sun maal akka ta'e beekuu barbaada
Tell him where to be.	Eessa akka ta'u itti himi.
A little bit of this	Xiqqoo kana keessaa
I didn’t understand him	Ani isa hin hubanne ture
I don't know your name.	Maqaa kee hin beeku.
I want you to be there	Akka ati achi jirtu nan barbaada
But I knew it was there	Garuu akka jiru nan beeka ture
There is no time.	Yeroon hin jiru.
He hasn't done it yet.	Ammallee hin goone.
I couldn’t see anyone	Nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye
That's how it's going to be.	Akkas ta'uuf deema.
I couldn’t see them.	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
But look what we have here.	Garuu ilaalaa waan asitti qabnu.
And I did the same thing.	Anis akkas godhe.
It's a very good thing.	Waan baayyee gaarii ta'e.
He was nothing like you.	Inni akka kee homaa hin turre.
I like it that simple	Akkas salphaa ta'ee natti tola
I love my husband.	Abbaa manaa koo nan jaalladha.
Nothing happened.	Wanti tokkollee hin taane.
I think it’s true, most of the time.	Dhugaa natti fakkaata, yeroo baay’ee.
I wasn’t looking at her	Ani ishee ilaalaa hin turre
Something like that has happened here, many, many times.	Wanti akkasii asitti, yeroo baay’ee, yeroo baay’ee ta’ee jira.
Which none of us have.	Kan nu keessaa tokkollee hin qabne.
I couldn’t say anything inappropriate	Waan sirrii hin taane dubbachuu hin dandeenye
So far, so good.	Hanga ammaatti, akkasitti gaarii.
You became home.	Ati mana taate.
He told me he had it.	Akka qabu natti hime.
I have to admit it looks pretty good	Baayyee gaarii akka fakkaatu amanuu qaba
I could never have left him	Silaa gonkumaa isa dhiisuu hin danda'u ture
But it wouldn't have been any better.	Garuu silaa kana caalaa hin ta'u ture.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
He didn’t have a proper job.	Hojii sirrii hin qabu ture.
I think you can really be something	Dhuguma waan tokko ta'uu dandeessa jedheen yaada
I have to go back a little bit	Xiqqoo duubatti deebi'uu qaba
I’m not you anymore	Kana booda ani si miti
It took a little while.	Yeroo xiqqoo fudhate.
You need to ask for help.	Gargaarsa gaafachuu qabda.
He was in a terrible state.	Haala hamaa keessa ture.
He needs time to think about it	Yeroo itti yaadu barbaada
Some great stuff.	Waan guddaa tokko tokko.
I like being different	Adda ta'uu nan jaalladha
He spoke their language.	Afaan isaanii dubbata ture.
How it should be lived.	Akkamitti jiraachuu qaba.
They couldn’t be that.	Isaan akkas ta’uu hin dandeenye.
I didn't want to tell him why.	Maaliif akka ta'e itti himuu hin barbaanne.
Look at my path.	Karaa koo ilaalaa.
They are waiting for me.	Na eegaa jiru.
I can come here again tonight	Halkan kana ammas as dhufuu nan danda'a
A great man.	Nama guddaa.
Not a good situation.	Haala gaarii miti.
Now that doesn’t matter.	Amma sun homaa hin qabu.
I can see you just fine	Ani akka gaariitti si arguu nan danda'a
Nuts, nuts, nuts.	Nuti, nuti, nuti.
We may have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabna ta'a.
I really can’t say enough about everything and everyone	Dhuguma waa’ee waan hundumaa fi nama hundumaa gahaa dubbachuu hin danda’u
Nobody wants that.	Namni akkas barbaadu hin jiru.
We have many eyes.	Ija hedduu qabna.
I love nights like that	Halkan akkasii nan jaalladha
It all seems to go there.	Hundi isaanii gara achitti waan deemu fakkaata.
Maybe I should walk on it.	Tarii irra deemuu qaba ta'a.
I never knew what to do about that	Waa'ee sanaa maal akkan godhu gonkumaa hin beeku ture
Now I don't know what it is.	Amma maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
I'm the only one ever.	Ani qofa yoomiyyuu.
Hope this helps you out.	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdii qabna.
He's there later.	Booda achi jira.
She wasn’t in it.	Isheen keessa hin turre.
I really have nothing to say	Dhuguma waanan jedhu hin qabu
This was an obvious mistake.	Kun dogoggora ifa taʼe ture.
I know it's been a long time	Yeroo dheeraa akka ta'e nan beeka
You can always find another job.	Yeroo hundumaa hojii biraa argachuu dandeessa.
Another day, she would have.	Guyyaa biraa, ni qabdi turte.
This could just be me though.	Kun ana qofa ta'uu danda'a garuu.
It could come anytime.	Yoomiyyuu dhufuu danda'a.
I could see no way around it	Karaa itti naannoo isaa jiru tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
I didn’t want to know more.	Kana caalaa beekuu hin barbaanne.
I started asking him questions	Gaaffii isa gaafachuu jalqabe
Now was not the time.	Amma yeroon isaa hin turre.
I didn’t realize she wanted me so much	Hamma kana akka na barbaaddu hin hubanne
They were one.	Isaan tokko turan.
I know what it was	Maal akka ture nan beeka
I haven’t seen my house in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf mana koo hin argine
With this person.	Nama kana waliin.
Just wanted your opinion on it	Yaada keessan qofa irratti barbaade
We still don’t care.	Ammallee dhimma hin qabnu.
I think he was waiting for me	Na eegaa ture natti fakkaata
I think everything happens for a reason.	Wanti hundi sababa qaba jedheen yaada.
They’re just different.	Adda ta’uu isaanii qofa.
All that is needed is a good idea.	Wanti barbaachisu yaada gaarii qofa.
I looked around.	Anis naannoo koo ilaale.
I think so.	Akkas jedheen yaada.
I love that feeling.	Miira sana nan jaalladha.
But I knew the truth.	Dhugaa jiru garuu nan beeka ture.
Maybe they have.	Tarii qaban ta'a.
It was a house.	Mana ture.
I thought of that, too	Anis sana yaade
I know my husband.	Abbaa manaa koo nan beeka.
Within a year.	Waggaa tokko keessatti.
She wouldn’t have gone along with that.	Silaa sana waliin hin deemtu turte.
I thought he must have an issue	Dhimma tokko qabaachuu qaba jedheen yaade
We are in the same school.	Mana barumsaa tokko keessa jirra.
I went up to my room	Gara kutaa kootti ol ba'e
I hoped it wouldn’t go too far	Garmalee akka hin deemne abdiin qaba ture
But it’s not my opinion.	Garuu yaada koo miti.
He doesn’t know me.	Na hin beeku.
They are doing really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
I know it can happen with you	Si waliin ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka
I know it's a little bit	Xiqqoo ta'uu isaa nan beeka
Someone who is different.	Nama adda ta'e.
I certainly know all this	Kana hunda akkan beeku beekamaadha
More than meeting their parents.	Warra isaanii waliin wal arguu caalaa.
We have something more important.	Waan kana caalaa barbaachisaa ta’e tokko qabna.
Not doing what anyone wants me to do	Waan namni tokkollee akkan godhu barbaadu gochuu dhiisuu
What you want may not be the best.	Wanti ati barbaaddu hunda caalaa gaarii taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
You can still have it.	Ammas qabaachuu dandeessa.
I didn't tell anyone about it	Waa'ee kanaa namatti hin himne
I told him that wasn't much	Anis sun baay'ee akka hin taane itti hime
I told him a lot of truth	Dhugaa baay'een itti hime
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I couldn’t tell you that	Kana sitti himuu hin dandeenye
But he didn’t like me.	Garuu na hin jaallatu ture.
He should have said this.	Waan kana jechuu qaba ture.
I couldn’t tell my mom the truth	Dhugaa jiru haadha kootti himuu hin dandeenye
I don't mean that.	Akkas jechuu koo miti.
It never seemed like enough.	Gonkumaa waan gahaa ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
I didn't know her	Ani ishee hin beekne
I haven’t known him for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isa hin beekne
We need to work together.	Waliin hojjechuu qabna.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
I think about it every day and night	Halkan fi guyyaa hunda itti yaada
There was no reason.	Sababni tokkollee hin turre.
I know you’re lonely	Kophaa akka taate nan beeka
I think we’re just too different	Garmalee adda taane qofa natti fakkaata
But he didn’t seem interested.	Garuu fedhii kan qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
They should not eat late at night.	Halkan yeroon booda nyaata nyaachuu hin qaban.
I think it could be dangerous	Balaa qabaachuu danda'a jedheen yaada
It's probably right.	Sirrii ta'uu hin oolu.
I hope he knows what he’s doing	Waan hojjetu akka beeku abdiin qaba
That’s going to help us.	Sun nu gargaaruuf deema.
Probably not very big.	Baay'ee guddaa ta'uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
Everything will be fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'a.
I think it's right	Sirrii natti fakkaata
I think it was his voice.	Sagalee isaa ture natti fakkaata.
I didn’t know any better	Kana caalaa hin beeku ture
I can't quite believe it's still happening.	Ammallee ta'aa jiraachuu isaa guutummaatti amanuu hin danda'u.
Nothing so far.	Hanga ammaatti homaa hin jiru.
he thought to himself	jedhee yaade
I never knew anyone else before.	Kanaan dura nama biraa beeku hin beeku.
I need to do something	Waan tokko gochuun na barbaachisa
Maybe they should give a little.	Tarii xiqqoo kennuu qabu ta'a.
I thought you were one of them	Isaan keessaa ati tokko natti fakkaate
He should have seen right through it	Silaa karaa isaatiin sirriitti arguu qaba ture
The old thing.	Waan durii.
John had to work.	Joon hojjechuu qaba ture.
Enjoyed the food very much.	Nyaata sanatti baayyee gammade.
Just a little bit of time.	Yeroo xiqqoo qofa.
It requires a full commitment	Waadaa guutuu barbaada
I told him how all this happened	Akkamitti kun hundi akka ta'e itti hime
It wouldn't have been the right thing to do.	Silaa waan sirrii hin ta'u ture.
This is not about the girl, it never was.	Kun waa'ee intala sanaa miti, gonkumaa hin turre.
It was a clear night.	Halkan ifa ta'e.
Not my mother.	Haadha koo miti.
I told him it was a few weeks	Torban muraasa akka ta'e itti hime
I couldn't tell him.	Itti himuu hin dandeenye.
I really hope this isn’t one of those times	Yeroon kun yeroo sana keessaa tokko akka hin taane dhuguma abdiin qaba
All of this can be extremely different.	Kun hundi garmalee adda ta’uu danda’a.
This is not the answer.	Kun deebii miti.
I know thoughts, actions, actions	Yaada, hojii, hojiin beeka
But we shouldn’t do that.	Garuu kana gochuu hin qabnu.
I didn’t know anywhere else to go	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin beeku ture
I want to go tomorrow	Boru deemuu barbaada
I wanted to stop thinking	Yaadu dhiisuu barbaade
He knew now that he had to have it.	Akka qabaachuu qabu amma beeka ture.
I don’t do it.	Hin godhu.
That all works out.	Sun hundi ni hojjeta.
Boy, they were wrong.	Gurbaa, dogoggora turan.
I couldn’t forgive him	Dhiifama isaaf gochuu hin dandeenye
I couldn’t ask any questions	Gaaffii tokkollee gaafachuu hin dandeenye
He was there, that was enough.	Inni achi ture, sun gahaa ture.
But it’s right.	Garuu sirrii dha.
This rarely happens.	Kun yeroo muraasaaf ta’a.
I wouldn't have wanted to.	Silaa hin barbaadu ture.
It's not that bad,' she said.	Akkas hamaa miti,' jette.
I mean, there were no people	Namoonni hin turre jechuu kooti
But it seems right.	Garuu sirrii fakkaata.
How can it be	Akkamitti ta'uu danda'a .
I saw him just moments ago	Yeroo muraasa dura qofa isa arge
Nothing was going with us.	Wanti nu waliin deemu hin turre.
That’s how you want it, right.	Akkasitti ati barbaaddu mitiiree.
One could see right through it.	Namni tokko sirriitti karaa isaatiin arguu danda’a ture.
You can’t help everyone.	Nama hunda gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
As you know, the.	Akka beektu kan.
In this case, that doesn’t really matter.	Haala kana keessatti, sun dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
It would have been right.	Silaa sirrii ta'a.
But she was fine.	Garuu isheen gaarii turte.
I have my own.	Kan koo qaba.
He is not obliged.	Dirqama irra hin jiru.
He was a great guy.	Gurbaa guddaa ture.
He told her not to do that	Akkas akka hin goone itti hime
If so, that's fine.	Yoo ta'e gaarii dha.
I wasn't really sure	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre
He does not tell us what this was.	Kun maal akka ture nutti hin himu.
It wasn't about him.	Waa'ee isaa hin turre.
I like it very much.	Baayyee natti tola.
I don't know about this one.	Waa'ee isa kanaa hin beeku.
I'm pretty sure he made his week.	Torban isaa akka godhe mirkanaa'aa dha.
I was everything and everyone.	Ani waan hundumaa fi nama hunda ture.
Just saw a new car last night.	Kaleessa halkan konkolaataa haaraa qofa arge.
I don’t love you any more than you love me.	Ani akka ati na jaallattu caalaa si hin jaalladhu.
I know him, I know him.	Ani isa beeka.
I didn't know who he was then	Yeroo sana eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
Except it's going to happen again.	Ammas ta'uuf jira malee.
I haven’t really done it yet	Dhuguma hanga ammaatti hin goone
I want to know what happened.	Waan ta'e beekuu barbaada.
She was here three months.	Ji'a sadii as turte.
I couldn't think.	Yaadu hin dandeenye.
It’s not my problem.	Rakkoo koo miti.
I think it might be true	Dhugaa ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
I just didn’t have that desire	Fedhii sana qofa hin qabu ture
I love the passion.	Fedhii baay'een jaalladha.
It’s on the road.	Karaa irra jira.
I was wrong, like really wrong.	Ani dogoggora ture, akka dhuguma dogoggora.
The time was not soon enough.	Yeroon sun dafee hin turre.
But you don't have it.	Garuu hin qabdu.
I want to do this for him	Kana isaaf gochuun barbaada
He didn't do it now.	Amma hin goone.
I knew he didn’t want to see me	Na arguu akka hin barbaanne nan beeka ture
That seems like a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa fakkaata.
No one is here for long.	Namni yeroo dheeraaf as hin jiru.
I should never have come here	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture
I didn't know what she was saying.	Waan isheen jedhu hin beekne.
I just wasn’t interested	Fedhii qofa hin qabu ture
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
But what she means.	Jechuun ishee garuu.
It’s not you.	Ati miti.
I know you did.	Akka ati goote nan beeka.
This is no longer true.	Kun kana booda dhugaa miti.
He would have needed it.	Silaa isa barbaachisa ture.
We were so very different.	Akkas baayyee adda turre.
We have no place in our house.	Mana keenya keessatti bakka hin qabnu.
I’m not into any of them.	Ani isaan keessaa tokkollee keessa hin jiru.
Can't say more about it	Kana caalaa waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
It was bright.	Ifa ture.
I was a very bad thing	Ani waan baayyee hamaa ture
Obviously you can’t.	Akka hin dandeenye ifaadha.
It shouldn’t have gone that way	Silaa akkasitti deemuu hin qabu ture
Everything was in working order	Wanti hundi haala hojii irra ture
That’s not necessarily a bad thing of course.	Sun dirqama waan hamaa miti beekamaadha.
I thought she was for a moment	Yeroo muraasaaf ishee natti fakkaate
Most likely the right person is around.	Baay’ee kan hin oolle namni sirrii ta’e naannoo keessan jira.
About...	Waa'ee...
So he went away.	Kanaaf deeme.
I think that was a huge mistake	Sun dogoggora guddaa ture jedheen yaada
Husband, wife and children	Abbaa manaa, haadha manaa fi ijoollee
It would have really been something.	Silaa dhuguma waan tokko ta'a ture.
This person is a human being.	Namni kun nama.
But it would never work.	Garuu gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
We thought it was great.	Guddaa nutti fakkaate.
Lots of questions to be answered.	Gaaffii baay'ee deebii argachuu qabu.
That's the kind of guy he was.	Gurbaa inni akkas ture.
Everyone else does.	Kan biraa hundi ni godhu.
I can't speak anymore	Kana booda dubbachuu hin danda'u
He is tall.	Inni dheeraa dha.
I never want to see her again.	Kana booda gonkumaa ishee arguu hin barbaadu.
She was new.	Isheen haaraa turte.
He always had good luck there	Yeroo hundumaa achitti carraa gaarii qaba ture
It just has a feeling	Miira qofa qaba
I really didn’t need it right now	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kana na hin barbaachifne
I hadn’t seen him before.	Kanaan dura isa hin argine ture.
It wasn’t much help.	Gargaarsa guddaa hin turre.
He didn’t need any more	Kana caalaa isa hin barbaachifne
Almost everything about each other.	Waa'ee walii waan hundumaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
I have been trying for you.	Siif yaalaa tureera.
I can never play enough of that	Sana gahaa taphachuu gonkumaa hin danda'u
That's not what needs to happen.	Wanti ta'uu qabu kanuma miti.
We’re both fine.	Lamaan keenyayyuu gaarii jirra.
I still don't know if that's the case.	Ammallee akkas ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
You don’t have another week.	Torban biraa hin qabdu.
But only during the day.	Garuu guyyaa qofa.
Perhaps none really happened.	Tarii dhuguma tokkollee hin taane taʼa.
That’s their problem.	Rakkoon isaanii kanuma.
Does anyone know how to make this happen?.	Kana akkamitti akka ta'u namni beeku jiraa?.
I still had so many questions about her.	Ammallee waa'ee ishee gaaffii baay'een qaba ture.
You need someone to help you	Nama si gargaaru barbaada
Simple as that really.	Salphaa akka sana dhuguma.
I’ve always known that	Yeroo hundumaa sana beeka
I think that’s really important	Sun dhuguma barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
They are trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa jiru.
I wasn't sure if it was good or bad	Gaarii fi hamaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
It was a terrible time.	Yeroon sun yeroo hamaa ture.
But I know them.	Ani garuu isaan beeka.
Why buy a new one?.	Maaliif haaraa bitachuu?.
I want to go.	Ani deemuu barbaada.
But there was no one.	Garuu namni hin turre.
He really wanted her.	Inni dhuguma ishee barbaada ture.
I wanted to know if you knew them	Isaan beekuu kee beekuu barbaade
I still don’t know how he did it.	Akkamitti akka godhe ammallee hin beeku.
I really like these people.	Namoota kana baay'een jaalladha.
I just have this feeling	Miira kana qofa qaba
To do this, it must be perfect.	Kana gochuuf guutuu ta’uu qaba.
I wouldn't have done it otherwise	Osoo akkas ta'ee hin godhu ture
I started screaming right then	Anis yeroo sana iyyuu jalqabe
He told me he had something to tell me.	Waan natti himu akka qabu natti hime.
The time was now.	Yeroon isaa amma ture.
I still wasn't sure what it was	Ammallee maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre
It can be a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa ta'uu danda'a.
He is with you as one in your sleep	Hirriba kee keessatti akka tokko si waliin jira
I always like it there	Yeroo hundumaa achitti natti tola
I knew what we needed	Waan nu barbaachisu nan beeka ture
It may not happen tomorrow.	Boru ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I can't do without my job	Hojii koo malee hojjechuu hin danda'u
I hope he comes after us.	Nu booda akka dhufu abdiin qaba.
Then he had an idea.	Sana booda yaada tokko qaba ture.
I had no curiosity either	Anis fedhii beekuu hin qabu ture
I can't play anymore	Kana booda taphachuu hin danda'u
Right? 	Sirrii?
They really love me.	Isaan dhuguma na jaallatu.
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
She can’t believe it.	Isheen amanuu hin dandeessu.
I knew this was true	Kun dhugaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture
Maybe it's true.	Tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
That’s what you want.	Kan ati barbaaddu kanuma.
I wonder what he was doing in my room	Kutaa koo keessatti maal hojjechaa ture jedheen yaada
But not her real name.	Garuu maqaa ishee isa dhugaa miti.
But I couldn’t find it.	Garuu argachuu hin dandeenye.
It really wasn’t an issue.	Dhuguma dhimma hin turre.
I didn't know what it was then	Yeroo sana maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I didn’t know what else to do.	Kan biraa maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
This is just not the case.	Kun akkas miti qofa.
I want that life.	Jireenya sana nan barbaada.
They love each other very much.	Baay'ee wal jaallatu.
You can ask him.	Isa gaafachuu dandeessu.
You are absolutely correct.	Ati guutummaatti sirrii dha.
It was there.	Achi ture.
Many know a lot about a lot of things.	Baay'een waa'ee waan baay'ee waan baay'ee beeka.
That was never going to happen.	Sun gonkumaa ta'uuf hin turre.
They know they are good.	Gaarii ta'uu isaanii ni beeku.
It had happened at that time.	Yeroo sanatti ta'ee ture.
He needs to know why you are doing this	Maaliif akkas akka gootu beekuu qaba
But she .	Garuu isheen .
I just didn't know it was that bad.	Akkas hamaa ta'uu isaa qofa hin beeku ture.
It has everything we need	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda qaba
He seems like a good guy.	Gurbaa gaarii fakkaata.
It was the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ture.
But I don't think so.	Ani garuu akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
I will never do it again	Kana booda yoomiyyuu hin godhu
I can’t seem to help myself.	Of gargaaruu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
But it was before that.	Garuu sana dura ture.
I want to go with her	Ishee waliin deemuun barbaada
He has food and she doesn’t	Nyaata qaba isheen hin qabdu
Have.	Qaba.
He still hasn’t spoken to me.	Ammallee natti hin dubbanne.
It could be something.	Waan tokko ta'uu danda'a.
There’s no real reason, you just know.	Sababni dhugaa hin jiru, ati qofa beekta.
I’m not really kidding.	Dhuguma qoosaa hin jiru.
Something happened here, something real.	Asitti wanti tokko ta'e, waan dhugaa ta'e.
I know almost nothing about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama
He no longer told the exact time.	Kana booda yeroo sirrii hin himne.
We need to find Him.	Isa argachuu qabna.
I think she knows it	Isheen waan beektu natti fakkaata
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
He hadn’t told anyone yet, though not completely	Guutummaatti osoo hin taane hanga ammaatti namatti hin himne ture
I didn’t want that at all	Ani tasumaa akkas hin barbaanne ture
I know the area a lot better than you do.	Naannoo sana baay'ee si caalaa beeka.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Kun akka hin taane ifaadha.
I don't really understand what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru dhuguma naaf hin galle.
It’s not really my business.	Dhuguma dhimma koo miti.
He was going every night	Halkan hunda deemaa ture
But it was no more.	Garuu kana caalaa hin turre.
The same thing.	Kan wal fakkaatu.
I was pretty bad out there at work	Ani hojii irratti achi keessaa baayyee hamaa ture
So there you have it.	Kanaaf achitti qabda.
But they don’t have it.	Garuu hin qaban.
Until you realized you were her	Hanga ati ishee ta'uu kee hin hubanne
Maybe just a few weeks.	Tarii torban muraasa qofa.
I hope he still thinks so	Ammas akkas akka yaadu abdiin qaba
I really want that	Sana baay'een barbaada
I was sure it was simple nonsense	Waan hin taane salphaa akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa ture
It couldn’t have been more accurate.	Kana caalaa sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u ture.
But now I think things might be different	Amma garuu wanti adda ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
I want to ask them something	Waan tokko isaan gaafachuu barbaada
It was really long.	Dhuguma dheeraa ture.
I love who she is now	Amma eenyu akka taate nan jaalladha
It was a lot.	Baay'ee ture.
I hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
Next week.	Torban dhufu.
I can meet your friends	Hiriyyoota kee waliin wal arguu nan danda'a
I'll be looking for you in three hours	Sa'aatii sadii booda si barbaada
I wouldn't be able to sleep	Silaa hirriba hin danda'u ture
I need them.	Isaan na barbaachisa.
He had a wife who loved him well.	Haadha manaa akka gaariitti isa jaallattu qaba ture.
That's what sets him apart from most people.	Namoota baay'ee irraa kan adda isa godhu kanuma.
It’s not an easy one.	Kan salphaa miti.
There was nothing of the newcomer about her.	Waa'ee ishee wanti nama haaraa sanaa hin turre.
It was currently three days.	Yeroo ammaatti guyyaa sadii ture.
Maybe it will be this week.	Tarii torban kana ni ta'a.
we must go back.	duubatti deebi'uu qabna.
But we didn’t.	Garuu nuti hin taane.
I just can't forgive that	Sana qofa dhiifama gochuu hin danda'u
I need something similar with this.	Kana waliin waan wal fakkaatu na barbaachisa.
I shouldn’t be watching this	Kana ilaalaa jiraachuu hin qabu
A dangerous job	Hojii balaa qabu
I knew he wanted me	Akka na barbaadu nan beeka ture
It was very important to us.	Baayyee barbaachisaa nuuf ture.
I wonder what else is going on.	Kan biraa maaltu deemaa jira jedheen yaada.
He didn’t have good parents.	Warra gaarii hin qabu ture.
I didn’t see them.	Isaan hin argine.
The reason for this is unclear.	Sababni kanaa ifa miti.
This is what we wanted.	Kan nuti barbaanne kana.
I had so many questions and no answers	Gaaffii baay'een qaba ture deebii tokkollee hin qabu ture
I need it so much.	Baay'ee na barbaachisa.
If she should live that long.	Yoo hangas jiraachuu qabdi.
I didn't know she was sure.	Mirkanaa'aa akka taate hin beeku ture.
He had a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa qaba ture.
I hadn’t thought of it that way	Akkasitti hin yaadne ture
I'd rather have her with you	Osoo isheen si bira turte naaf wayya
We are working on the situation.	Haala jiru irratti hojjechaa jirra.
Obviously not here.	Asitti akka hin taane ifaadha.
I am in no mood.	Ani yaada tokkollee keessa hin jiru.
I knew it would happen	Akka ta'u nan beeka ture
I couldn't find anything specific about it	Waa'ee isaa waan adda ta'e argachuu hin dandeenye
Very, very good for us.	Baayyee baayyee gaarii nuuf.
I'm glad it's you	Si ta'uu isaatti gammadeera
But I couldn't do that	Ani garuu akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
I'm not sure that's the case.	Akkas akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
They were so wrong.	Isaan baay'ee dogoggora turan.
I should have told you all this	Silaa kana hunda sitti himuu qaba ture
Always a human being.	Yeroo hundumaa nama.
But she doesn’t care.	Garuu isheen dhimma hin qabdu.
He has something to say.	Waan jedhu qaba.
I really don’t understand.	Dhuguma naaf hin galle.
That's a lot.	Baay'ee jechuun.
Check it out for me.	Naaf ilaalaa.
I don't want to be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu hin barbaadu.
This is no longer necessary.	Kana booda kun barbaachisaa miti.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
I just couldn’t believe I was doing this	Kana gochaa jira jedhee amanuu qofa hin dandeenye
There just isn't much time.	Yeroon baay'ee hin jiru qofa.
I couldn’t see that one.	Isa sana arguu hin dandeenye.
But it could be true.	Garuu dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
As they should have been.	Akkuma silaa ta'uu qabu.
She has no one.	Nama hin qabdu.
Only a few.	Muraasa qofa.
It was me in there.	Achi keessa ana ture.
He wanted to know.	Inni beekuu barbaade.
There was a lot going on that day	Guyyaa sana waan baay'een deemaa ture

It’s just in me.	Ana qofa keessa jira.
I can't tell you where it is.	Eessa akka jiru sitti himuu hin danda'u.
They knew the truth.	Dhugaa jiru beeku turan.
I couldn't talk to her about it	Waa'ee kanaa ishee waliin dubbachuu hin dandeenye
Sometimes that’s a good thing.	Yeroo tokko tokko sun waan gaarii dha.
We need to have jobs and jobs.	Hojii fi hojii qabaachuu qabna.
When they may not have.	Yeroo isaan qabaachuu dhiisuu danda'u.
I can only talk about them	Waa'ee isaanii qofa dubbachuu danda'a
Just everyday life.	Jireenya guyyaa guyyaa qofa.
I just know better	Ani akka gaariitti qofa beeka
Which he did.	Kan inni godhe.
It was time to make everything clear.	Yeroon waan hunda ifa godhu ture.
We need them right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana isaan barbaachisa.
I don’t know what it’s like anymore.	Kana booda maal akka fakkaatu hin beeku.
We saw her name.	Maqaa ishee argine.
He knew exactly where he was	Bakka jiru sirriitti beeka ture
I wasn't sure if it was him	Isa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
This was his house.	Kun mana isaa ture.
Wondering what I can find in them.	Maal isaan keessa argachuu danda'a yaada jedhu.
I already knew we got along well	Akka gaariitti akka walii galle duruu beeka ture
I want you to go for it	Akka ati itti deemtu nan barbaada
He could have done that well	Gaarii kana gochuu dandaʼa ture
That would be a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ta'a.
I am no longer myself.	Ani kana booda ofii koo miti.
I want to go with them	Isaan waliin deemuu barbaada
I didn't think it would be like that	Akkas ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
That's what happens here.	Asitti kan ta'u kanuma.
We need to know more.	Caalaatti beekuu qabna.
He has a really good life	Dhuguma jireenya gaarii qaba
I certainly was, but he thought it was a good thing.	Ani akkan ture beekamaadha, garuu inni waan gaarii natti fakkaate.
I can't say that, yet	Akkas jechuu hin danda'u, ammallee
I would totally be like him	Ani guutummaatti akkuma isaa ta'a ture
A man without hope.	Nama abdii hin qabne.
But I didn't do anything	Ani garuu homaa hin goone
One didn't have him.	Inni tokko isa hin qabu ture.
I think it will do me some good	Gaarii tokko tokko naaf godha jedheen yaada
No one else can give you that.	Namni biraa sana siif kennuu hin danda'u.
Time to get some work done.	Yeroo hojii tokko tokko hojjechuuf.
This sounds more like what you want.	Kun caalaatti waan ati barbaaddu fakkaata.
I doubt this was easy	Kun salphaa akka ture nan shakka
He asked for help.	Gargaarsa gaafate.
We have the opportunity to do something different.	Waan adda ta'e hojjechuuf carraa qabna.
I didn't know what that thing was	Wanti sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I was right.	Ani sirrii ture.
They often involve a great deal of risk.	Yeroo baay’ee balaa guddaa of keessaa qabu.
That's how I wanted you.	Akkas si barbaade.
I was no longer that person	Kana booda ani nama sana hin turre
I didn’t want what he had.	Waan inni qabu hin barbaanne.
Now you are on your way to becoming an adult.	Amma karaa nama guddaa ta'uu irra jirta.
I could tell her to go home.	Mana akka deemtu itti himuu nan danda'a ture.
Probably just not.	Tarii qofa ta'uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
He had a desire.	Fedhii tokko qaba ture.
Maybe we all are.	Tarii hundi keenya ta'uu danda'a.
People in her life already.	Namoota jireenya ishee duraan.
Herself about a year ago.	Ofii ishee gara waggaa tokko dura.
Not the same person.	Nama tokko miti.
I know you were doing it for me	Naaf gochaa akka turte nan beeka
A real bad feeling.	Miira hamaa dhugaa.
I wondered what I saw	Maal arge jedheen yaade
It could have been but it wasn't.	Ta'uu danda'a ture garuu hin turre.
She didn’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabdu turte.
It happens in two days.	Guyyaa lama keessatti ta'a.
I had no idea what was in them	Waan isaan keessa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I can still help her.	Ammallee ishee gargaaruu nan danda'a.
I shouldn’t have said any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee dubbachuu hin qabu ture
He didn't say anything.	Homaa hin dubbanne.
I didn’t see anything else.	Waan biraa hin argine.
That was the time.	Yeroon sun yeroo ture.
That’s perfectly fine.	Sun guutummaatti gaarii dha.

It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
That's it so far.	Hanga ammaatti sun.
They should be back soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti deebi'uu qabu.
Nothing, I don’t have to give.	Homaa, kennuu hin qabu.
He has a job.	Hojii qaba.
I can't believe they're real	Dhugaa ta'uu isaanii amanuu hin danda'u
It was easier here.	Asitti salphaa ture.
I couldn’t at the time.	Yeroo sanatti hin dandeenye.
So, it does happen.	Kanaaf, ni ta'a.
Glad I got them both	Isaan lamaan argachuu kootti gammadeera
He had no current clothes.	Uffata yeroo ammaa hin qabu ture.
This is sometimes, but not always, obvious.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko, garuu yeroo hundumaa miti, ifaadha.
I had a question for you though	Gaaffii tokko siif qaba ture garuu
He can't find any.	Inni tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u.
I can't live without children	Ijoollee malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
Ours is so obvious right now.	Kan keenya yeroo ammaa kana akka malee ifaadha.
Tell me what happened.	Waan ta'e natti himi.
People who are not us.	Namoota nu hin taane.
He was a dog in and through.	Inni nama saree keessaa fi karaa ture.
He would have in the past.	Silaa yeroo darbe qaba ture.
Like a mother, like a daughter.	Akka haadha, akka intala.
He is in it.	Inni keessa jira.
We’re both good to go.	Lamaan keenyayyuu deemuun gaarii dha.
It won’t go on for long, though.	Yeroo dheeraa hin deemu garuu.
I don't know if it's bad or not.	Hamaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
But this better not last too long.	Garuu kun yeroo dheeraa turuu dhiisuu wayya.
I can't do that to her this time	Yeroo kana akkas ishee gochuu hin danda'u
I thought it would happen again	Ammas ni ta'a jedheen yaade
I love this place already	Bakka kana duruu baay'een jaalladha
It was just this time.	Yeroo kana qofa ture.
A little, but that’s not important right now	Xiqqoo, garuu yeroo ammaa kana sun barbaachisaa miti
I couldn't get back to my place	Bakka kootti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
They don’t need one.	Tokko isaan hin barbaachisu.
Must be a lot of girls.	Intala baay'ee ta'uu qaba.
I just didn't want any of that to happen	Sana keessaa tokkollee akka ta'u qofa hin barbaanne
This cannot be happening.	Kun ta'aa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
She wasn’t thinking of herself.	Isheen of hin yaaddu turte.
We need more than that.	Kana caalaa nu barbaachisa.
I want to give a little	Xiqqoo kennuu barbaada
Sometimes it seems like that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas fakkaata.
No longer two people but one.	Kana booda nama lama osoo hin taane tokko.
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
It has all the clothes you need	Uffata isin barbaachisu hunda qaba
I knew nothing about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku ture.
But that’s the problem.	Garuu rakkoon jiru kanuma.
I certainly didn’t go.	Ani akkan hin deemne beekamaadha.
But you can’t find him.	Garuu isa argachuu hin dandeessu.
It can't be all that bad.	Akka sana hunda hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Good! 	Gaarii!
not exactly.	sirriitti miti.
Still nothing there.	Ammallee achitti wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
Man cannot buy his desires on his own	Namni fedhii isaa ofuma isaatiin bitachuu hin danda’u
He was doing it.	Gochaa ture.
Just like her.	Akkuma ishee.
And now it went further.	Ammas kana caalaa deeme.
No one asked him what was wrong.	Namni maaltu ta'e jedhee isa gaafate hin jiru.
This is not necessary, however.	Kun garuu hin barbaachisu.
I joined her at the door	Anis balbala irratti ishee waliin ta'e
I'm sure it was nothing, but it seemed real	Homaa akka hin turre mirkanaa'adha, garuu dhugaa natti fakkaate
Not always, of course.	Yeroo hunda miti beekamaadha.
They are more human-like.	Isaan caalaatti nama fakkaatu.
I like it soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti natti tola.
I wasn’t looking at you	Si ilaalaa hin turre
All on the same meal.	Hundi isaanii nyaata tokko irratti.
Who knows what will come of it.	Maaltu irraa dhufu eenyutu beeka.
I know yours.	Kan keessan nan beeka.
I really like this guy	Gurbaa kana baay'een jaalladha
I just didn’t want anyone to know.	Namni tokkollee akka beeku qofa hin barbaanne.
I didn’t know it at the time, but that was it.	Yeroo sanatti hin beeku ture, garuu kanuma ture.
He should get a new one	Haaraa argachuu qaba
We can't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeenyu.
He should have known it wouldn’t work.	Silaa akka hin hojjenne beekuu qaba ture.
I can't be here with you	Si waliin as jiraachuu hin danda'u
None of that matters anymore	Kana booda wanti sun tokkollee dhimma hin qabu
I can't go without her.	Ishee malee deemuu hin danda'u.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
It could be me.	Ana ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't know who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I didn't understand what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle
Again, no one is telling me what to say or not to say.	Ammas maal akkan jedhu fi hin dubbanne namni natti himu hin jiru.
You really are.	Dhuguma ati jirtu.
I think that’s possible	Sun ni danda’ama jedheen yaada
No one had an answer.	Namni deebii qabu hin turre.
He looked outside again	Ammas ala ilaale
Now I wasn't so sure about that	Amma waa'ee sanaa hangas mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I mean, everything is completely different.	Wanti hundi guutummaatti adda jechuu kooti.
I didn't have much time	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabu ture
But there were some problems that came up.	Garuu rakkoon tokko tokko kan dhufe ture.
It was a disaster, of course.	Balaa akka ture beekamaadha.
He wanted to go.	Inni deemuu barbaade.
He has a favor to ask for	Tola gaafachuu qabu qaba
I couldn't go back to the house	Mana sanatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
I need him to do that again	Ammas akkas akka godhu na barbaachisa
They can get it too.	Isaan illee argachuu dandaʼu.
Perhaps there was still one.	Tarii amma iyyuu tokko ture taʼa.
What does it look like?.	Maal fakkaata?.
I couldn't do this one	Isa kana hojjechuu hin dandeenye
I didn't want to see it.	Arguu hin barbaanne.
I have to go.	Ani deemuu qaba.
I could never have done that.	Silaa gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin danda'u ture.
He didn’t know himself	Of hin beeku ture
He is obvious.	Inni ifaadha.
I think of what she said	Waan isheen jette nan yaada
In a few .	Muraasa keessatti .
This year	Bara kana .
It was nothing to him.	Isaaf homaa hin turre.
I suspect he doesn’t like us	Nu hin jaallatu jedheen shakka
She only had one.	Tokko qofa qabdi turte.
They are all the same.	Hundi isaanii tokko.
I can't tell you anything else	Waan biraa sitti himuu hin danda'u
Not that it was good, though.	Gaarii ture jechuu miti garuu.
I think I might know what to do	Waan godhu beekuu danda'a jedheen yaada
I'm not important enough, apparently.	Ani barbaachisaa gahaa miti, fakkaata.
But not much.	Garuu baay'ee miti.
Again she was wrong.	Ammas isheen dogoggora turte.
Then he asked me my name.	Sana booda maqaa koo na gaafate.
I can see a little of him in you	Isa xiqqoo si keessaa arguu nan danda'a
I don't know how many days have passed.	Guyyaa meeqa akka darbe hin beeku.
No one told him.	Namni itti hime hin jiru.
That’s not what works for me.	Kan naaf hojjetu sun miti.
I must say that was good	Sun gaarii ture jechuun qaba
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He wanted them.	Isaan barbaada ture.
I don't know what to say.	Maal akkan jedhu hin beeku.
Not even with you.	Si waliin illee miti.
Grade.	Kutaa.
I probably should have said this earlier	Silaa kanaan dura kana jechuu qaba ture ta'a
I shouldn’t ask that	Ani akkas jedhee gaafachuu hin qabu
She didn’t get involved.	Isheen keessa hin galle.
I didn’t know what he was looking for	Waan inni barbaadaa ture hin beeku ture
I was older than I was.	Ani umuriin koo guddaa ture.
This is probably not the case.	Kun akkas ta’uu hin oolu.
I would say the same thing	Silaa kanuma nan jedha
It only happened once.	Yeroo tokko qofa ta'e.
It doesn't work properly.	Sirriitti hin hojjetu.
I really don’t think so.	Dhuguma natti hin fakkaatu.
But she didn't think it would happen here.	Garuu asitti ni ta'a jettee hin yaadne.
That’s not true, but it doesn’t matter.	Sun dhugaa miti, garuu homaa hin qabu.
But that’s not entirely clear.	Garuu sun guutummaatti ifa miti.
He has something to say	Waan jedhu qaba
I was so out of place.	Ani akkas bakka hin qabne ture.
There wasn't much to do today	Har'a waan baay'ee hojjechuuf hin turre
It is very dangerous.	Balaa guddaa qaba.
She’s still not looking at me.	Ammallee na ilaalaa hin jirtu.
He is no longer there.	Kana booda hin jiru.
That's what he loves the most.	Kan inni baay'ee jaallatu kanuma.
Maybe some time ago.	Tarii yeroo muraasa dura ta'uu danda'a.
It is extremely important now.	Amma garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
I am not after food.	Ani nyaata booda hin jiru.
He wasn’t there at the time	Yeroo sanatti achi hin turre
That was your one chance.	Carraa kee tokko kanuma ture.
I love it here.	Asitti baay'een jaalladha.
I want to do something else	Waan biraa hojjechuu barbaada
Then it’s not sound.	Sana booda sagalee miti.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I think it will be good for you	Siif gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
I knew you were out there	Akka ati ala jirtu nan beeka ture
But not quite the same.	Garuu guutummaatti wal fakkaatu miti.
I could live without either of them	Isaan lamaan keessaa tokko malee jiraachuu nan dandaʼa ture
Maybe you're wrong.	Tarii dogoggora ta'uu dandeessa.
There was nothing there to shout about.	Achitti wanti iyyuu danda'u hin turre.
She didn’t know me.	Isheen na hin beektu turte.
I had plenty of time yesterday	Kaleessa yeroo baay'een qaba ture
I never wanted to know	Ani gonkumaa beekuu hin barbaanne
So, I don’t do any.	Kanaaf, tokkollee hin godhu.
You had time in those days.	Bara sanatti yeroo qabda turte.
It was me and it was with me.	Na turee fi na waliin ture.
I wanted to do more and see more and be more.	Caalaatti hojjechuu fi caalaatti arguu fi caalaatti ta'uu barbaade.
There are so many things here	Waan baay'ee as jiru
I won't do it now.	Amma hin godhu.
She has a good idea of ​​what is going on.	Waan deemaa jiru yaada gaarii qabdi.
I can find your mother	Haadha kee argachuu nan danda'a
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
That's what I thought	Kana natti fakkaate
Usually that doesn't work very well.	Yeroo baayyee sun baayyee gaarii hin hojjetu.
I could no longer see their eyes.	Kana booda ija isaanii arguu hin dandeenye.
He’s in the car and he’s on the road.	Konkolaataa keessa jira karaa irra jira.
Without it, however	Osoo hin taane garuu
I think we should be back soon	Yeroo dhiyootti deebi'uu qabna jedheen yaada
I think they all do a good job	Hundi isaanii hojii gaarii hojjetu jedheen yaada
So we were too.	Kanaaf nuti illee turre.
But he saw her.	Inni garuu ishee arge.
I think it goes further	Kana caalaa waan deemu natti fakkaata
A very big man, but a man	Nama baayyee guddaa, garuu nama
It’s very dangerous.	Baayyee balaa guddaa qaba.
Looks like new!.	Haaraa fakkaata!.
He told me what to do.	Waan godhu natti hime.
Didn't do anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa hin goone.
Among them.	Isaan keessaa.
I think that would be really neat	Sun dhuguma sirrii ta'a jedheen yaada
They are doing something.	Waan tokko hojjechaa jiru.
I no longer have this problem	Kana booda rakkoon kun hin qabu
Two weeks later	Torban lama booda
I certainly do	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha
I can't find what it was then or what it is now.	Yeroo sana maal akka turee fi amma maal akka ta'e argachuu hin danda'u.
All this time he knew everything.	Yeroo kana hunda waan hunda beeka.
I can get another job	Hojii biraa argachuu nan danda'a
This cannot be the case.	Kun ta'uu hin danda'u.
That and the shoes.	Sana fi kophee.
I suggest you forgive	Dhiifama akka gootu yaada kooti
So far I am thoroughly pleased with myself.	Hanga ammaatti sirriitti ofitti gammadeera.
I'd rather not talk.	Dubbachuu dhiisuu naaf wayya.
No one spoke for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf namni dubbate hin jiru.
When you love you so much.	Yeroo ati akkas si jaallatu.
We have to do it ourselves.	Ofii keenya gochuu qabna.
I can't do anything	Ani homaa gochuu hin danda'u
That's exactly what happened.	Kan ta'e sirriitti kanuma.
I wanted to be just like her	Anis akkuma ishee ta'uu barbaade
It’s not just this one.	Isa kana qofa miti.
I think he did a pretty good job	Hojii baayyee gaarii hojjete natti fakkaata
But then it was very different.	Garuu sana booda baayyee adda ture.
I thought you could say that	Akkas jechuu dandeessa jedheen yaade
I can't even help you	Si gargaaruu illee hin danda'u
You could say he is a completely new person	Nama guutummaatti haaraa dha jechuu dandeessa
That shouldn't be the case.	Sun ta'uu hin qabu.
But it still contains good intentions.	Garuu ammas yaada gaarii of keessaa qaba.
I wasn't sure that was even possible	Sun illee ni danda'ama ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
No one would tell me why	Maaliif akka ta'e namni natti himu hin jiru ture
Something I didn't want to happen.	Waan ta'uu hin barbaanne.
I didn’t want to live	Ani jiraachuu hin barbaanne
Not just rarely, but often.	Yeroo muraasa qofa osoo hin taane, yeroo baayyee.
You’re not in trouble, yet.	Rakkoo keessa hin jirtu, ammallee.
I never did it.	Ani gonkumaa hin goone.
You can’t trust these people.	Namoota kana amanuu hin dandeessu.
That’s all you can believe right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti ati amanuu dandeessu kana qofa.
It wouldn’t have occurred to me.	Silaa natti hin dhufu ture.
You are not me'.	Ati ana miti'.
I could have done better	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu nan danda'a ture
I can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin danda'u.
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu akkas miti.
I’m not a guy anymore.	Kana booda ani gurbaa miti.
not at all sure what that is.	sun maal akka ta’e gonkumaa mirkanaa’aa miti.
I thought you didn’t really care	Ati dhuguma dhimma hin qabdu jedheen yaade
He had no one for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf nama hin qabu ture
You never know when it will happen.	Yoom akka ta'u gonkumaa hin beektu.
It was great.	Guddaa ture.
There was only one thing that could do this.	Kana gochuu kan danda'u waan tokko qofa ture.
He said he had no food.	Nyaata hin qabu jedheen.
This was a big deal for him.	Kun isaaf waan guddaa ture.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
I didn't realize it was all this	Kana hunda akka ta'e hin hubanne
It was the only voice in the room right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sagalee kutaa sana keessa jiru qofa ture.
I don’t want to be around him.	Ani naannoo isaa jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
He wasn't saying it.	Jechuu isaa hin turre.
I have a matter.	Ani dhimma qaba.
They want you.	Isaan si barbaadu.
It was a huge mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa ture.
I mean, it was nothing	Homaa hin turre jechuu kooti
He went somewhere.	Bakka tokko deeme.
The most recent one.	Kan yeroo dhiyootti.
This was not necessary.	Kun hin barbaachisu ture.
He should never have given up	Silaa gonkumaa harka kennuu hin qabu ture
But that's not what this is about.	Garuu kun waa'ee kanaa miti.
I didn’t want to go	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne
It was what he was.	Waan inni ture ture.
I just can't do that to myself	Of irratti akkas gochuu qofa hin danda'u
I needed a job and money.	Hojii fi maallaqa na barbaachisa ture.
He's in a completely different situation now.	Amma guutummaatti haala adda ta'e irra jira.
Not entirely accurate, however.	Guutummaatti sirrii miti garuu.
I don't know how it happened .	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku .
Which is very dangerous	Kan baayyee balaa qabu
You are a wife.	Ati haadha manaa dha.
I had my parents around me	Warra koo naannoo koo ture
It looked like a lot.	Baayyee fakkaata ture.
She didn't know who was in there.	Eenyu akka achi keessa jiru hin beektu turte.
She had such eyes.	Ija akkasii qabdi turte.
They were at a different place in their lives.	Jireenya isaanii keessatti bakka adda taʼe irra turan.
I can be like that too	Anis akkas ta'uu nan danda'a
Everything looks pretty good around here.	Naannoo asitti wanti hundi baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
That is, the.	Kana jechuun.
There is no problem anymore.	Kana booda rakkoon hin jiru.
I wouldn’t really call it sleep	Dhuguma hirriba hin jedhu ture
Then I will do it	Sana booda nan godha
I haven’t for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hin qabu.
I mean all those people	Namoota sana hunda jechuu kooti
I didn’t know what to tell him	Waan itti himu hin beeku ture
This is not enough.	Kun gahaa miti.
She didn’t look like me.	Isheen na hin fakkaattu turte.
Then to me. 	Sana booda natti. 
I don't know.	ani hin beeku.
He looks like someone he knows.	Nama inni beeku fakkaata.
But I can't find her	Ani garuu ishee argachuu hin danda'u
I really think that’s important	Dhuguma sun barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
Fortunately, it's fine.	Akka carraa ta'ee gaarii dha.
Getting her interested.	Fedhii ishee argachuu.
Three years, it’s a road.	Waggaa sadii, karaa dha.
That was the worst thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa hamaa taʼe sun ture.
It seems to have exactly what you’re looking for.	Waan ati barbaaddu sirriitti waan qabu fakkaata.
I started to back away	Anis duubatti deebi'uu jalqabe
Not on her.	Ishee irratti miti.
There are so many things you can do.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu dandeessu.
Fortunately, no one else knew about it except me	Akka carraa ta'ee ana malee namni biraa hin beeku ture
He had been there two days now.	Amma guyyaa lama achi ture.
I didn’t need another girl.	Intala biraa na hin barbaachifne.
He wanted to know if there was anyone else here	Asitti namni biraa jiraachuu isaa beekuu barbaade
That all goes away.	Sun hundi ni deema.
I’m not going to do those though.	Ani garuu warra sana hojjechuuf hin deemu.
I need time to think about it	Yeroon itti yaadu na barbaachisa
I always thought of myself as a good mother	Yeroo hundumaa akka haadha gaariitti of yaada ture
It shouldn't be a big deal.	Waan guddaa ta'uu hin qabu.
In this case we have.	Haala kana keessatti qabna.
Not a week.	Torban tokko miti.
I love you so much	Baay'een si jaalladha
Not a little girl.	Intala xiqqoo miti.
He became a new person	Nama haaraa ta'e
We need all the help we can get.	Gargaarsa argachuu dandeenyu hunda nu barbaachisa.
It's happening right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana waan ta'aa jiru.
I don't have much to say.	Waan baay'ee dubbachuu hin qabu.
You wouldn't know them, otherwise.	Silaa isaan hin beektu turte, osoo akkas ta'ee.
This is what he was looking at.	Kun waan inni ilaalaa ture.
No one knows, it just happens.	Namni beeku hin jiru, ta'a qofa.
You had an answer.	Deebii qabda turte.
I checked my watch again	Ammas sa'aatii koo ilaale
I don't even know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
They are so lucky.	Akka malee carraa qabu.
Look at this one.	Isa kana ilaalaa.
You don't have to talk about them.	Waa'ee isaanii dubbachuu hin qabdu.
I mean, it could exist	Jiraachuu danda'a jechuu kooti
I didn't understand you.	Si hin hubanne.
I enjoyed it immensely.	Ani akka malee itti gammade.
I don’t know why not.	Maaliif akka hin taane hin beeku.
They have a job and a life.	Hojii fi jireenya qabu.
I wouldn’t want to be in that situation	Ani haala sana keessa jiraachuu hin barbaadu ture
The problem has to come from within.	Rakkoon jiru keessaa dhufuu qaba.
All he can do right now is buy time.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti inni gochuu danda'u yeroo bitachuu qofa.
We have something in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu qabna.
But it was still a big mistake.	Garuu ammas dogoggora guddaa ture.
I know you have one	Tokko akka qabdu nan beeka
He says my father.	Abbaa koo jedha.
It's right there.	Sirriitti achi jira.
I couldn’t tell anything else	Waan biraa himuu hin dandeenye
It still looks like old times.	Ammas bara durii fakkaata.
It wasn’t enough for us.	Nu gahaa hin turre.
I have to do what everyone else wants	Waan namni hundi barbaadu gochuun qaba
I haven’t seen you in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf si hin argine
I have a couple of questions	Gaaffii tokko lama qaba
You have to have someone.	Nama qabaachuu qabda.
I didn’t know who she was	Eenyu akka taate hin beeku ture
That is their job.	Hojiin isaanii kanuma.
I would love to do that	Ani akkas gochuun baayʼee natti tola
That, however, is not the case.	Sun garuu hin ta'u.
I didn't see what happened	Waan ta'e hin argine
He doesn't need it.	Isa hin barbaachisu.
It wasn’t there anymore.	Kana booda hin turre.
He’s not even here yet.	Ammallee as illee hin jiru.
But he understood.	Garuu hubate.
I said it was okay	Anis homaa miti jedheen
So it was pretty clear what needed to happen.	Kanaaf maaltu ta'uu akka qabu baay'ee ifa ture.
I am no longer myself	Ani kana booda ofii koo miti
He seems to have done so.	Akkas waan godhe fakkaata.
I couldn’t say more.	Kana caalaa jechuu hin dandeenye.
Seems easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata.
This happens to many people.	Kun namoota baay’ee irratti ni ta’a.
Good luck to us.	Carraa keenya gaarii.
They were right, of course.	Isaan sirrii akka turan beekamaadha.
It was one of the many things about them that stood out.	Waa'ee isaanii wantoota hedduu adda ta'e keessaa tokko ture.
But that’s what they call life.	Garuu jireenya kanuma jedhu.
You didn’t tell me anything.	Ati homaa natti hin himne.
He was the guy who did that.	Inni gurbaa akkas godhe ture.
I already knew what she was thinking	Waan isheen yaaddu duruu beeka ture
he said to himself	jedhee ofitti jedhe
But it wasn’t what she wanted.	Garuu waan isheen barbaaddu hin turre.
I know everything will work out for you	Wanti hundi akka siif ta'u nan beeka
After what we saw today.	Waan har'a argine booda.
Be a good mother and a good father.	Haadha gaarii fi abbaa gaarii ta'aa.
I shouldn’t say it but it is	Jechuu hin qabu garuu ni jira
I don't know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
I just can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu qofa hin danda'u.
You can ask about this later.	Booda waa'ee kanaa gaafachuu dandeessu.
I don't mean to yell	Iyyuu jechuu koo miti
It was my existence.	Jiraachuu koo ture.
I didn’t, but just	Ani hin goone, garuu qofa
But not many mistakes.	Garuu dogoggora baay'ee miti.
I think we should speak up.	Dubbachuu qabna jedheen yaada.
I don't think there's much you can say about it	Waa'ee kanaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu dandeessu hin jiru jedheen yaada
There were no real people in them.	Namoonni dhugaa isaan keessa hin turre.
I knew him better than he knew me then	Yeroo sana na beeku caalaa ani isa beeka
This time, it’s just real.	Yeroo kana, dhugaa qofa.
Didn't do much along the way	Karaa irratti waan baay'ee hin hojjenne
That doesn’t mean they have what it takes.	Kana jechuun waan isaan barbaachisu qaban jechuu miti.
Not one of them.	Tokkollee miti.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf si waliin kophaa ta'uu barbaade
He started towards him	Gara isaatti jalqabe
So I know you’re new.	Kanaaf haaraa akka taate nan beeka.
Today, nearly all of them.	Har’a, hundi isaanii jechuun ni danda’ama.
She became a little bit.	Xiqqoo taate.
Your time is not long, you know.	Yeroon kee dheeraa miti, ni beekta.
I was only in your house one day	Guyyaa tokko qofa mana keessan ture
I really do like you	Dhuguma akka kee nan godha
That’s how people work better.	Akkasitti namoonni caalaatti hojjetu.
He may have an early night	Halkan dafee qabaachuu danda'a
I can't do what he says	Waan inni jedhu gochuu hin danda'u
That's how it happens most of the time.	Yeroo baayyee akkas ta'a.
He was human, as it were.	Nama ture, akka waan.
I just like it a lot more now	Amma baay'ee natti tola qofa
He thought she was his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa itti fakkaate.
Now, I just have one issue.	Amma, dhimma tokko qofa qaba.
It’s not her voice that’s problematic.	Rakkoo kan qabu sagalee ishee miti.
They are similar but not the same.	Wal fakkaata malee tokko miti.
They love me.	Isaan na jaallatu.
I think it's a good thing.	Waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
I might be able to help	Gargaaruu nan dandaʼa taʼa
He still has a chance	Ammallee carraa qaba
This one really worked.	Inni kun dhuguma hojjete.
Maybe this is a mistake.	Tarii kun dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
I don’t like school here	Asitti mana barumsaa hin jaalladhu
I'm looking at her.	Ani ishee ilaalaa jira.
People help each other.	Namoonni wal gargaaru.
But he couldn't tell.	Garuu beekuu hin dandeenye.
It’s not a picture.	Suuraa miti.
It wasn't just about not backing down.	Duubatti deebi'uu dhiisuu qofa hin turre.
Which makes you special to me.	Kan naaf adda si godhu.
To do something different with my life.	Jireenya koo irraa waan adda ta'e hojjechuuf.
I wasn't sure if it was funny.	Qoosaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I then tried again, again nothing	Anis sana booda ammas yaale, ammas homaa hin taane
I was still alone	Ammas kophaa koo ture
But now that wasn't going to happen.	Amma garuu akkas ta'uuf hin turre.
But not like you.	Garuu akka kee miti.
I didn't really know what it was	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku ture
I don't know what will happen to this house.	Mana kana maal akka ta'u hin beeku.
I would have wanted to make room for him	Silaa bakka isaaf kennuu nan barbaada ture
I have good days and bad days	Guyyaa gaarii fi guyyaa hamaa qaba
But this is just what he did.	Garuu kun waan inni godhe qofa.
More people are looking for work	Namoonni baay'een hojii barbaadaa jiru
No one else can do this.	Namni biraa kana gochuu hin danda'u.
That didn’t work out so well.	Sun akkas gaarii hin taane.
I think you need all the time you can get	Yeroo argachuu dandeessu hunda si barbaachisa jedheen yaada
I never wanted to stay there for the rest of my life	Jireenya koo guutuu achi turuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
I won't do it now.'	Amma hin godhu' jedhe.
I would never have known.	Silaa gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
Everything seemed to come out right with this one.	Tokko kanaan wanti hundi sirriitti waan ba'e fakkaata ture.
The father of the father	Abbaa kan abbaa
I knew that could never happen	Sun gonkumaa taʼuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
I knew it was this one	Isa kana akka ta'e nan beeka ture
She wasn’t like that, not anymore.	Isheen akkas hin turre, kana booda miti.
I couldn't say why.	Maaliif jechuu hin dandeenye.
Not like my father.	Akka abbaa koo miti.
She wouldn’t have wanted that.	Silaa akkas hin barbaaddu ture.
I didn't do anything	Ani homaa hin goone
I know what yours is	Kan kee maal akka ta'e nan beeka
It was more than curiosity	Fedhii beekuu caalaa ture
I like it there.	Achitti natti tola.
It was a night.	Halkan ta'e.
He never needed it.	Gonkumaa isa hin barbaachifne.
I doubt it ever will	Yoomiyyuu akka ta'u nan shakka
I couldn’t see anymore	Kana booda arguu hin dandeenye
He had been looking for her for hours	Sa'aatii dheeraaf ishee barbaadaa ture
You don’t have to do that if you don’t want to.	Yoo hin barbaanne akkas gochuun dirqama miti.
It was always him.	Yeroo hundumaa isa ture.
Most of the time, it works very well.	Yeroo baayyee, baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
I wouldn't have thought this could have happened to us.	Silaa kun nuuf ta'uu danda'a jedhee hin yaadu ture.
I wonder what he wants	Maal barbaada jedheen yaada
I didn't think much of it at the time	Yeroo sanatti baay'ee itti hin yaadne
That’s how important it is.	Akkas barbaachisaa dha.
I can't do this without him	Isa malee kana gochuu hin danda'u
This was nothing new.	Kun waan haaraa hin turre.
I want you more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa si barbaada
A local man.	Nama naannoo sanaa.
That’d be good.	Sun gaarii ta’a.
But not more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa miti.
She doesn't need it.	Ishee hin barbaachisu.
I just didn’t know what she wanted	Waan isheen barbaaddu qofa hin beeku ture
We don’t have a problem.	Rakkoo hin qabnu.
I'm so glad to see you	Si arguu kootti baay'een gammade
I think it will be next year for him	Isaaf bara dhufu ta'a jedheen yaada
They should ask questions.	Gaaffii gaafachuu qabu.
One of you guys.	Isin keessaa tokko.
It would be different, just the two of them.	Silaa adda ta'a, isaan lamaan qofa.
But, he’s not just a teacher.	Garuu, inni barsiisaa qofa miti.
I wanted to tell you that	Akkas sitti himuu barbaade
He was waiting for you	Si eegaa ture
It may not last long.	Yeroo dheeraa turuu dhiisuu danda'a.
That was not the only thing that went wrong.	Wanti dogoggora taʼe kana qofa hin turre.
I can't tell you that	Ani akkas sitti himuu hin danda'u
I wish everyone didn’t know	Osoo namni hundi hin beekne natti tola
They love each other.	Wal jaallatu.
The lighting works well though.	Ifa garuu akka gaariitti hojjeta.
People love that stuff.	Namoonni waan sana ni jaallatu.
It came later in time.	Yeroo booda dhufe.
I had no idea how I would be	Akkamitti akkan ta'u yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It's not right.	Sirrii miti.
But I couldn't do it	Ani garuu gochuu hin dandeenye
Then again, it may not.	Sana booda ammas, ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
He said it wouldn't happen.	Hin ta'u jedhe.
Everyone will.	Namoonni hundi ni.
Maybe we can't live like that.	Tarii akkas jiraachuu hin dandeenyu ta'a.
Now they were together again.	Amma ammas waliin turan.
I need to do something soon	Yeroo dhiyootti waan tokko gochuun na barbaachisa
This cannot be reversed.	Kun duubatti deebi’uu hin danda’u.
You know, like, work.	Beektaa, akka, hojii.
So, he said.	Kanaaf, jedhe.
If it isn’t.	Yoo hin taane.
Keeshan looked at himself	Keessan of ilaale
I won't say his name.	Maqaa isaa hin jedhu.
But that’s not entirely true.	Garuu sun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
I don’t think this is a good morning	Kun ganama gaarii natti hin fakkaatu
With all that.	Sana hunda waliin.
Maybe that will never happen	Tarii sun gonkumaa hin ta'u ta'a
I met her last month	Ji'a darbe ishee waliin wal arge
And he will do it again.	Ammas ni godha.
I only want the best for you	Waan gaarii qofa siif barbaada
We have so much more than we thought.	Kan nuti yaadne caalaa waan baay'ee qabna.
He took both her hands in his.	Harka ishee lamaan harka isaatti fudhate.
If anyone knows.	Yoo namni beeku.
It can be helpful.	Gargaarsa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I wish that was the case in our case	Osoo dhimma keenya irratti akkas ta'ee natti tola
Things she shouldn’t know.	Wantoota isheen beekuu hin qabne.
That didn’t work.	Sun hin hojjenne.
I forgive you, this time	Dhiifama siif godha, yeroo kana
I have a good feeling about you.	Ani waa'ee kee miira gaarii qaba.
I hoped this time would come later	Yeroon kun booda akka dhufu abdiin qaba ture
He is right.	Inni sirrii dha.
I will go for three days	Guyyaa sadii nan deema
I couldn’t speak for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
But what is there.	Garuu maaltu jira.
I don't think that would be a very good idea.	Sun yaada baayyee gaarii ta'a jedhee hin yaadu.
Just friends.	Hiriyyoota qofa.
In fact, it is.	Dhugaa irratti.
Not even me.	Ana illee miti.
He is waiting for him.	Isa eegaa jira.
She was a big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa turte.
I had no idea about it	Waa'ee kanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I mean the whole situation.	Haala guutuu jechuu kooti.
Silly.	Salphaa.
I need you a lot right now	Yeroo ammaa kana baay'een si barbaachisa
He saw everything	Waan hundumaa arge
Someone needs to help them out of this situation.	Haala kana keessaa namni isaan gargaaru jiraachuu qaba.
I just thought I would.	Anis jedheen yaada qofa.
I have a feeling like that	Miira akkas ta'e qaba
There, that was better.	Achitti, sun wayya ture.
I started by doing that.	Sana gochuudhaan jalqabe.
I doubt anyone is	Namni akka jiru nan shakka
I love things like that	Wantoota akkasii nan jaalladha
He would still do them for us	Ammas isaan nuuf godha ture
I know it was her.	Ishee akka turte nan beeka.
I think you need him	Inni si barbaachisa jedheen yaada
He knows the place, of course.	Bakka sana ni beeka, beekamaadha.
He knew them too well, he could see them too well.	Garmalee sirriitti isaan beeka, garmalee sirriitti isaan arguu danda'a ture.
But it’s not her.	Garuu ishee miti.
I can't play it.	Ani taphachuu hin danda'u.
They must be housekeepers.	Mana eegaa ta'uu qabu.
So you don’t like that one book.	Kanaaf kitaaba tokko sana hin jaallattu.
I can't see who is doing it	Eenyu akka gochaa jiru arguu hin danda'u
Here, not so much.	Asitti, hangas miti.
Lots of yours.	Kan keessan baay'ee.
But this doesn’t work.	Garuu kun hin hojjetu.
He thought he should never have come here	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture jedhee yaade
I wasn’t as lucky as you	Ani akka kee carraa hin qabu ture
I can't talk anymore tonight	Halkan kana kana booda dubbachuu hin danda'u
I have no new ideas.	Yaada haaraa hin qabu.
You were lucky.	Carraa qabda turte.
She was one of many children.	Ijoollee hedduu keessaa tokko turte.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing.	Sun dirqama waan hamaa ta’uu hin qabu.
I didn't know who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I mean, who knows what could happen	Waan ta'uu danda'u eenyutu beeka jechuu kooti
You can’t buy this life.	Jireenya kana bitachuu hin dandeessu.
I would have needed them later	Silaa booda isaan na barbaachisa ture
I could do nothing but help.	Gargaarsa malee homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
She was up there.	Isheen achi ol turte.
This is obviously not true.	Kun dhugaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
But today was a good day.	Har'a garuu guyyaa gaarii ture.
I am now a mother.	Ani amma haadha.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
I’m never going to do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuuf hin deemu
I think a lot of people do	Namoonni baay'een ni godhu jedheen yaada
I really enjoyed this book	Kitaaba kana baay'een gammade
I have to go somewhere	Bakka tokko deemuun qaba
Someone obviously needs to tell him.	Namni tokko itti himuu akka qabu ifaadha.
I looked it all up	Ani barbaadu hunda isaa ilaale
I haven’t seen her before.	Kanaan dura ishee hin argine.
I say, I say, again	Ani nan jedha, nan jedha, ammas
They weren’t good enough.	Isaan gaarii hin turre.
He's been great.	Inni guddaa ta'ee jira.
I mean, who cares.	Eenyutu dhimma qaba jechuu kooti.
I'm looking for it.	Ani barbaadaa jira.
But without him, we have to do those things alone.	Garuu isa malee wantoota sana kophaa keenya hojjechuu qabna.
Man, their existence	Nama, jiraachuu isaanii
You can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
I know this is the reality	Dhugaa jiru kana akka ta'e nan beeka
I did not know who he was.	Eenyu akka taʼe hin beeku ture.
I could stay there all day	Guyyaa guutuu achi turuu nan dandaʼa ture
That wasn’t the answer.	Sun deebii hin turre.
I'm pretty sure there were two answers.	Deebii lama akka ture mirkanaa'aa dha.
This was going to happen.	Kun ta'uuf ture.
I love you so much.	Baay'een si jaalladha.
I couldn’t find my father	Abbaa koo argachuu hin dandeenye
None of that really matters to us.	Wanti sun tokkollee dhuguma nuuf barbaachisaa miti.
I can't believe how something happened	Wanti tokko akkamitti akka ta'e amanuu hin danda'u
Which I didn’t want.	Kan ani hin barbaanne.
I think they could have done better in that area.	Silaa naannoo sanatti kana caalaa hojjechuu danda'u turan jedheen yaada.
I mean better than them	Isaan caalaa gaarii jechuu kooti
I always say that, all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas nan jedha, yeroo hundumaa.
It was just our luck.	Carraa keenya qofa ture.
I knew nothing about it	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture
Hopefully this is not a problem.	Kun rakkoo akka hin taane abdii qabna.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
It was mine.	Kan koo ture.
You're here.	Ati as jirta.
I can be honest about them.	Waaʼee isaanii dhugaa dubbachuu nan dandaʼa.
But I know she doesn’t need to	Isheen garuu akka hin barbaachifne nan beeka
I know exactly what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeka.
It just wasn’t right.	Qofa sirrii hin turre.
Nothing could be simpler.	Wanti kana caalaa salphaa taʼuu dandaʼu hin jiru.
Not that they have as much luck.	Carraa hamma kanaa qaban jechuu miti.
I must be the one there	Ani kan achi jiru ta'uu qaba
Just like she was.	Akkuma isheen turte.
He was just trying to help one of his kids.	Inni ijoollee isaa keessaa tokko gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa ture.
I am a wife and a mother.	Ani haadha manaa fi haadha.
But tonight I’m glad I came with him	Halkan kana garuu isa waliin dhufuu kootti gammadeera
I am not alone, he said	Ani kophaa koo miti jedhe
That’s really it.	Dhuguma kanuma.
I was a good husband and father	Ani abbaa manaa fi abbaa gaarii ture
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
It wasn’t there anymore.	Kana booda hin turre.
I didn’t know anything	Ani homaa hin beeku ture
I need so much more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee na barbaachisa.
But this can be a problem.	Garuu kun rakkoo ta’uu danda’a.
I thought it must be just you	Si qofa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaade
He was in great trouble	Rakkoo guddaa keessa ture
I have been waiting for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf eegaa ture.
I can't go back now	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
He could have found someone.	Silaa nama argachuu danda'a ture.
Sorry, but there is.	Dhiifama garuu ni jira.
I think we were wrong about it	Waa'ee isaa dogoggora turre natti fakkaata
I can't leave my mother alone	Haadha koo kophaa dhiisuu hin danda'u
I knew he was having a bad day	Guyyaa hamaa akka qabu nan beeka ture
Didn’t need any work	Hojii tokkollee hin barbaachifne
I don't think you will.	Ni gootu natti hin fakkaatu.
I haven’t seen you all day	Guyyaa guutuu si hin argine
I couldn’t give you hope, not so soon	Abdii siif kennuu hin dandeenye, akkas dafee miti
Not this person.	Nama kana miti.
I told him this morning	Ganama kana itti hime
I want to believe you	Si amanuu barbaada
A long, long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa dura.
I don't know if it happened or not.	Ta'ee jiraachuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
It’s different there.	Achitti adda.
I am willing to help you loved one	Ani nama jaallattu si gargaaruuf fedhii qaba
I couldn’t meet him.	Isa waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye.
But still no luck.	Garuu ammas carraa hin qabu.
I didn’t know why I was doing this	Maaliif akkas akkan godhu hin beeku ture
So far I think it works for me.	Hanga ammaatti waan naaf hojjetu natti fakkaata.
But that’s not enough.	Garuu sun gahaa miti.
In the old days.	Bara durii.
I'm sure it's just a mistake.	Dogoggora qofa akka ta'e mirkanaa'adha.
I didn't do anything.	Ani homaa hin goone.
I can't help him without that name	Maqaa sana malee isa gargaaruu hin danda'u
But it has been.	Garuu tureera.
I have nothing else to say today	Har'a waan biraa jedhu hin qabu
They are looking at me now.	Amma na ilaalaa jiru.
I have no idea what to make of it	Maal irraa akkan godhu yaada hin qabu
Even living in the same house.	Mana tokko keessa jiraachuu illee.
This should be good.	Kun gaarii ta'uu qaba.
I think they go together.	Waliin deemu natti fakkaata.
I know a lot of things are true	Waan baay'een dhugaa akka ta'e nan beeka
I can't help you anymore.	Kana booda si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I don’t have a feeling	Miira hin qabu
All the good stuff.	Waan gaarii hunda.
You know them.	Ati isaan beekta.
I couldn’t find another one	Kan biraa argachuu hin dandeenye
He couldn’t see them, but he shouldn’t have.	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye, garuu arguu hin qabu ture.
He didn’t do that.	Inni akkas hin goone.
I have no idea what she wants.	Waan isheen barbaaddu yaada hin qabu.
He was still in the same room	Ammallee kutaa tokko keessa ture
I couldn’t find anything	Homaa argachuu hin dandeenye
I can't stay here long	Asitti yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u
There was nothing better for me.	Kana caalaa wanti naaf hin turre.
I wanted to be the one she had on her	Ani isa isheen ishee irratti qabdu ta'uu barbaade
I couldn’t see anything	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye
I don’t think we need him anymore.	Kana booda isa nu barbaachisu natti hin fakkaatu.
It was that simple.	Akkas salphaa ture.
I can't do that anymore	Kana booda akkas gochuu hin danda'u
I know you’re a good person	Nama gaarii akka taate nan beeka
I definitely still do.	Ammallee akkan godhu beekamaadha.
I have no idea what happened.	Maaltu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
Do you .	Ati .
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
I can't believe he did that	Akkas akka godhe amanuu hin danda'u
I just don’t know what to do with you.	Maal akkan si godhu qofa hin beeku.
But now it’s.	Amma garuu.
There was so much he still didn't know.	Kan inni ammallee hin beekne baay'ee ture.
You are here for you.	Ati siif as jirta.
Every day, every night, every hour.	Guyyaa hundumaa, halkan hundumaa, sa’aatii hundumaa.
No one will ever know.	Namni gonkumaa beeku hin jiru.
That doesn’t sound like what you want.	Sun waan ati barbaaddu hin fakkaatu.
But not in your case, obviously.	Garuu dhimma keessan irratti akka hin taane, ifaadha.
There was nothing that worked.	Wanti hojjete hin turre.
You and the girl.	Ati fi intala.
This is my father.	Kun abbaa kooti.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Kana jechuun homaa jechuu miti.
I can't make you do anything	Homaa akka gootu si gochuu hin danda'u
He had done nothing.	Homaa hin goone ture.
Of course, it certainly is.	Kan beekamaadha, akka ta’e beekamaadha.
It was beyond his day.	Guyyaa isaa ol ture.
Mine wasn't going to be some of them.	Kan koo isaan keessaa tokko tokko ta'uuf hin turre.
I need you so much in my life, girl	Jireenya koo keessatti baay'een si barbaachisa intala
That was a great night.	Halkan sun halkan guddaa ture.
I couldn’t see what she did	Waan isheen goote arguu hin dandeenye
Just a simple question.	Gaaffii salphaa qofa.
I really, really do.	Ani dhuguma, dhuguma nan godha.
During the interview, I wondered how it worked	Yeroo gaaffii fi deebii sanatti akkamitti hojjete jedheen yaade
All but one.	Tokko malee hunda.
I knew what it was like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture
He didn't speak again.	Ammas hin dubbanne.
Not when it mattered.	Yeroo barbaachisaa ture miti.
I didn’t know what to do here	Asitti maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
You don't have to go back anymore	Kana booda duubatti deebi'uu hin qabdu
That person is not going to be me.	Namni sun ana ta'uuf hin deemu.
I could never do the right thing, ever	Yoomiyyuu waan sirrii hojjechuu hin dandeenye, yoomiyyuu
I never knew what it was	Maal akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku ture
Nothing is more important than my job.	Hojii koo caalaa wanti barbaachisaa taʼe hin jiru.
There was no need for one.	Tokko hin barbaachisu ture.
That she knows.	Akka isheen beektu.
I think he needs some space	Bakka tokko tokko isa barbaachisa jedheen yaada
I couldn’t be more wrong.	Kana caalaa dogoggora ta’uu hin danda’u.
But she didn't go.	Isheen garuu hin deemne.
I think the timing was right	Yeroon isaa sirrii ture jedheen yaada
Then someone was at the door.	Sana booda namni tokko balbala irra ture.
Then he has no voice.	Sana booda sagalee hin qabu.
I wanted to ask him something.	Waan tokko isa gaafachuu barbaade.
I can make you one of us	Nu keessaa tokko si gochuu nan danda'a
In them it was always morning.	Isaan keessatti yeroo hunda ganama ture.
I know he did the job, but never again.	Hojii sana akka hojjete nan beeka, garuu kana booda gonkumaa.
She was his favourite.	Isheen kan inni jaallattu turte.
I need help	Gargaarsa nan barbaada
I know all about that guy	Waa'ee gurbaa sanaa hunda nan beeka
But not more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa miti.
But we are there.	Nuti garuu achi jirra.
I want to do well at my job	Hojii koo irratti akka gaariitti hojjechuu nan barbaada
What you want is not a great opportunity.	Waan barbaaddu carraa guddaa miti.
He looks like my father	Abbaa koo fakkaata
He was on the right track	Karaa sirrii irra ture
For good reason, as you probably know.	Sababa gaarii qaba, akkuma beektu taʼa.
We need to help her.	Ishee gargaaruu qabna.
He wanted to know everything	Waan hundumaa beekuu barbaade
He needed him more than anything right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waan hundumaa caalaa isa barbaada ture
I didn’t know how to help them.	Akkamitti akkan isaan gargaaru hin beeku ture.
I know we are not alone	Kophaa keenya akka hin taane nan beeka
I have no idea how you do it	Akkamitti akka gootu yaada hin qabu
I wondered what was up with that picture	Suuraa sana irraa maaltu jira jedheen yaade
I'm just my opinion.	Ana qofa yaada koo.
I know it can happen	Ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka
Few, not many.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane muraasa.
I couldn’t ask for more	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye
I could get a job soon	Yeroo dhiyootti hojii argachuu nan danda'a ture
I couldn't get enough of this place	Bakka kana gahaa ta'uu hin dandeenye
Everything is going to be fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'uuf deema.
That's right.	Sirrii dha.
He wanted to go with her	Ishee waliin deemuu barbaade
I know what you are	Maal akka taate nan beeka
One was the exception.	Tokko kanaan ala ta’e.
Most of the time it is in now.	Yeroo baayyee amma keessa jira.
I know what mine is	Kan koo maal akka taʼe nan beeka
He wasn't entirely sure where he was supposed to go.	Bakka deemuu akka qabu guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Look where he is now.	Amma eessa akka jiru ilaalaa.
The past is not yours.	Kan darbe kan kee miti.
I'm not saying that all that happens	Sun hundi akka ta'u jechuu koo miti
Not so much this time.	Yeroo kana hangas miti.
I couldn’t find anything.	Homaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
The problem is that’s not enough.	Rakkoon jiru sun gahaa miti.
I couldn’t find one	Tokko argachuu hin dandeenye
But you can help.	Garuu gargaaruu dandeessa.
I know you won’t do that again.	Ammas akkas akka hin goone nan beeka.
I can tell him the truth	Anis dhugaa jiru itti himuu danda'a
You will love this.	Kana ni jaallattu.
You know being a parent.	Warra ta'uu ni beektu.
He was the same guy again	Ammas gurbaa sana ture
They knew they were dangerous.	Balaa akka qaban ni beeku turan.
I was alone in the house	Mana keessa kophaa koo ture
I knew this would be their answer	Kun deebii isaanii akka ta'u nan beeka ture
I love him, so much.	Ani isa jaalladha, kanaaf baay'een.
I just can't be idle	Ani hojii malee ta'uu qofa hin danda'u
Comment on that.	Sana irratti yaada kennuu.
I wonder what was in it	Maaltu keessa ture jedheen yaada
We need to see the light.	Ifa arguu qabna.
That's not what she said.	Kana miti jette.
I might be able to work with this	Kanaan hojjechuu nan danda'a ta'a
I really wanted to go back inside	Keessatti deebi'uu baay'een barbaade
They needed to know who else knew.	Eenyu kan biraa akka beeku beekuu qabu turan.
There were two of them.	Lama turan.
I want to tell my friends.	Hiriyyoota kootti himuu barbaada.
It's not a place for us.	Bakka nuuf hin ta'u.
I didn't know if that was good or not	Sun gaarii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku ture
I saw what happened.	Waan ta'e arge.
What is the problem?.	Rakkoon jiru maali?.
I mean, that was bad enough.	Sun hamaa gahaa ture jechuu kooti.
Now he wants a drink	Amma dhugaatii barbaada
Another time.	Yeroo biraa.
But it’s not good.	Garuu gaarii miti.
I know this, I know.	Ani kana nan beeka.
It's a little longer.	Xiqqoo dheeraa dha.
I wonder what's going on	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen yaada
They’re just real.	Isaan dhugaa qofa.
This is still wrong.	Kun ammallee dogoggora.
You thought you were going to the local one.	Gara kan naannoo sanaa deemtu sitti fakkaate.
I want to be with him	Isa wajjin taʼuu nan barbaada
We need to be more than that.	Sana caalaa ta'uu qabna.
I already know about those two	Waa'ee lamaan sanaa duruu beeka
Then he knew nothing.	Sana booda homaa hin beekne.
He should know better	Caalaatti beekuu qaba
He has three children	Ijoollee sadii qaba
This was a big deal for him	Kun isaaf waan guddaa ture
For a while that was fine.	Yeroo muraasaaf sun gaarii ture.
That’s not going to last.	Sun turuuf hin deemu.
He's waiting for you.	Si eegaa jira.
Then another one.	Sana booda kan biraa.
I couldn’t believe my good luck	Carraa gaarii koo amanuu hin dandeenye
This is my opportunity.	Kun carraa kooti.
Not sure it matters.	Dhimma akka qabu mirkanaa'aa miti.
It really was that good.	Dhuguma akkas gaarii ture.
But someone did.	Garuu namni tokko godhe.
I thought of my real mother	Haadha koo isa dhugaa nan yaade
I don’t know if you know this.	Kana beektu moo hin beektu hin beeku.
I know that's how it's supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka.
Everyone we met.	Nama wal argine hunda.
So sorry about that.	Kanaaf dhiifama waa'ee kanaa.
There is nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
Now there may never be another chance.	Amma carraan biraa gonkumaa jiraachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
I thought you knew something	Waan beektu jedheen yaade
I was there three ago	Sadii dura achi ture
This can be a good thing and a bad thing.	Kun waan gaarii fi hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
I know that place for you	Bakka sana siif beeka
People want more, you know.	Namoonni kana caalaa barbaadu, beekta.
I want to go home	Gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaada
None of them are inside.	Tokkollee keessaa hin jiru.
The best thing about living here.	Wanti gaarii ta'e as jiraachuu.
Most importantly.	Hunda caalaa.
I thought it was the right thing to do	Waan sirrii natti fakkaate
He always says it’s not true	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa miti jedha
He has a car outside.	Konkolaataa ala qaba.
Can you help with this? 	Kana irratti gargaaruu dandeessaa?
Right now that’s not necessary.	Yeroo ammaa kana sun barbaachisaa miti.
One problem may be time.	Rakkoon tokko yeroo taʼuu dandaʼa.
Just really good.	Dhuguma gaarii qofa.
It always would have been.	Yeroo hundumaa silaa.
No one told me.	Namni natti hime hin jiru.
I know a few of them	Isaan keessaa muraasa beeka
I just didn’t want you to leave	Akka ati deemtu qofa hin barbaanne
I still had no idea who she was	Ammallee eenyu akka taate yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
But I know better than that	Ani garuu kana caalaa beeka
Otherwise it is in new condition.	Yoo kana hin taane haala haaraa keessa jira.
I love life here.	Jireenya as jiru baay'een jaalladha.
I mean, we really don’t have to do two pictures.	Dhuguma suuraa lama hojjechuu hin qabnu jechuu kooti.
I’d rather not.	Ani osoo hin taane naaf wayya.
He needs to make this work.	Kana akka hojjetu gochuu qaba.
Someone said he knew me	Namni tokko na beeka jedhe
I didn’t even talk to him	Isa waliin illee hin dubbanne
I think it’s money.	Maallaqa natti fakkaata.
I will never be home with myself.	Yoomiyyuu ofii koo waliin mana hin jiru.
This must be the case.	Kun ta'uu qaba.
I know you don’t want to do it	Akka ati gochuu hin barbaanne nan beeka
I’m glad I have it.	Ani qabaachuu kootti gammadeera.
There is no chance of that.	Carraan sanaa hin jiru.
About...	Waa'ee...
I have only one thought.	Yaada tokko qofa qaba.
We are still working	Ammas hojjechaa jirra
Just for this week.	Torban kanaaf qofa.
But no one was there.	Garuu namni achi hin turre.
I just wanted to be clear.	Ifa ta'uu qofa barbaade.
People love being around them.	Namoonni naannoo isaanii jiraachuu ni jaallatu.
He was a good man.	Nama gaarii ture.
Nowadays, everyone wants to know everything about everyone else.	Yeroo ammaa kana namni hundi waa'ee nama hundumaa waan hunda beekuu barbaada.
I fully intend to stay here for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf as turuuf guutummaatti yaada qaba
It's never been like that.	Akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
I really didn’t need him to do that	Dhuguma akkas gochuun isaa na hin barbaachifne
You should know, he thought.	Beekuu qabdu jedhee yaade.
Just her mother.	Haadha ishee qofa.
More than you had before.	Kan kanaan dura qabdu caalaa.
Exclusive every night	Halkan hunda kan adda ta'e
People love them.	Namoonni isaan ni jaallatu.
I'm really sorry about that	Kanaaf dhuguma dhiifama
I can definitely handle it all day tonight and tomorrow.	Halkan kanaa fi boru guyyaa guutuu akkan danda'u beekamaadha.
He always wants the worst	Yeroo hundumaa isa hamaa barbaada
No one told me about it	Namni waa'ee kanaa natti hime hin jiru
She had no way of knowing.	Karaa itti beektu hin qabdu turte.
Very nice guy.	Gurbaa baayyee namatti tola.
I can't believe that worked	Sun hojjete jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
He only did that twice	Yeroo lama qofa akkas godhe
I think that should work.	Sun hojjechuu qaba jedheen yaada.
We are still waiting for an answer.	Ammallee deebii eegaa jirra.
He never did he now has a reason.	Inni gonkumaa hin goone inni amma sababa qaba.
He might get lucky tonight	Halkan kana carraa argachuu danda'a
I am no exception	Anis kanaan ala miti
She was a very good person.	Nama baayyee gaarii turte.
We are watching you.	Isin ilaalaa jirra.
I just saw this.	Kana amma arge.
I couldn’t stop coming	Dhufuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I don’t want to know anymore.	Kana booda beekuu hin barbaadu.
You can’t have everything.	Waan hundumaa qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
I would have gone tomorrow	Silaa boru deema ture
I can't tell him about it	Waa'ee isaa itti himuu hin danda'u
This should be enough for us.	Kun nuuf gahaa ta'uu qaba.
I love saying your name	Maqaa kee jechuu baay'een jaalladha
This is now.	Kun amma.
I'm very excited	Baay'een gammadeera
Maybe he was in it.	Tarii keessa ture ta'a.
I wondered what they would do	Maal godhu jedheen yaade
I didn’t know how to say it	Akkamitti akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
I never said you couldn’t work	Hojii hin dandeessu jedhee hin beeku
This 'everything else' was something they never talked about.	'Wanti biraa hundi' kun waan isaan gonkumaa hin dubbanne ture.
But he never did.	Garuu gonkumaa hin goone.
She is not an issue.	Isheen dhimma miti.
I never know what she thinks	Waan isheen yaaddu gonkumaa hin beeku
We are what we are.	Nuti waan taane.
But that’s not what we did.	Garuu waan nuti goone kana miti.
I think this is a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
But I don't know what to do.	Garuu maal gochuu akkan qabu hin beeku.
Maybe that will be enough.	Tarii sun gahaa ta'uu danda'a.
I hope you don’t know	Akka ati hin beekne abdiin qaba
You can tell me why you did it.	Maaliif akka goote natti himuu dandeessa.
I love you more than anything.	Waan hundumaa caalaa si jaalladha.
I don't know what's in it.	Waan keessa jiru hin beeku.
It doesn’t matter where you have to go.	Bakka deemuun qabdu homaa hin qabu.
At that time, he often .	Yeroo sanatti yeroo baayʼee .
I can't think of anyone who could do better.	Nama kana caalaa hojjechuu danda'u yaadu hin danda'u.
Now it was one of those times.	Amma yeroo sana keessaa tokko ture.
It must be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu qaba.
It doesn’t seem to work well.	Akka gaariitti waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
Not me anymore, extremely unlucky	Ani kana booda miti, garmalee carraa hin qabne
He was in a good mood all day.	Guyyaa guutuu miira gaarii keessa ture.
Then we went on our way.	Sana booda karaa keenya deemne.
I think this is a pretty big deal.	Kun waan baayyee guddaa natti fakkaata.
She doesn’t seem to be.	Isheen waan taate hin fakkaattu.
I could not quite see what it was	Maal akka taʼe sirriitti arguu hin dandeenye
I know there’s more to it than that	Kana caalaa akka jiru nan beeka
I don’t go to school.	Mana barumsaa hin deemu.
He has perfect parents	Warra guutuu qaba
There is no one like him.	Namni akka isaa hin jiru.
He says he didn't have time	Yeroo hin qabu ture jedha
I think they can see me	Na arguu danda'u jedheen yaada
I wonder what he did there	Achitti maal godhe jedheen yaada
I saw some opportunity for ideas.	Carraa yaada tokko tokko arge.
We are now.	Amma jirra.
Bad, bad, bad.	Hamaa, hamaa, hamaa.
I love them so much	Baay'een isaan jaalladha
I had that with him	Ani akkas isa waliin qaba ture
I didn't tell him much	Baay'ee itti hin himne
That is probably a mistake.	Sun dogoggora taʼuu hin oolu.
She was in the wrong.	Dogoggora keessa turte.
I’m not sure when it started	Yoom akka jalqabe mirkanaa’aa miti
After a while a voice spoke to me.	Yeroo muraasa booda sagalee tokko natti dubbate.
I think about humor a lot	Waa'ee qoosaa baay'een yaada
I mean, you.	Si jechuu kooti.
He didn't know me.	Ana hin beeku ture.
Not a bad one, this time.	Kan hamaa miti, yeroo kana.
It really will happen.	Dhuguma ni ta'a.
He didn't want to answer.	Deebii kennuu hin barbaanne.
I knew he would love it	Akka inni jaallatu nan beeka ture
I can never find her.	Yoomiyyuu ishee argachuu hin danda'u.
But he is not like that.	Inni garuu akkas miti.
But, you never know.	Garuu, ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
We’re on it.	Irra jirra.
That’s just his way.	Sun karaa isaa qofa.
They have great hopes.	Abdii guddaa qabu.
I didn’t see him go	Yeroo inni deemu hin argine
I don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabu.
I think this is right but it doesn't work.	Kun sirrii natti fakkaata garuu hin hojjetu.
He was much older than you.	Inni baayyee si caalaa guddaa ture.
That’s what those people were like.	Namoonni sun akkas turan.
I can't live without it	Isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
I mean, something outside.	Waan ala jechuu kooti.
I'm thinking of you.	Ani siif yaada.
I thought it was something different	Waan adda ta'e natti fakkaate
I haven’t been with you for a while now	Yeroo muraasaaf amma si waliin hin turre
There was nothing out of the ordinary.	Wanti adda ta'e tokkollee hin turre.
There is nothing.	Homaa hin jiru.
I told him it was no big deal	Anis waan guddaa akka hin taane itti hime
But it was like that.	Garuu akkas ture.
I can't help but do that	Akkas gochuu dhiisuu hin danda'u
But he had friends.	Garuu hiriyyoota qaba ture.
Now he was sure	Amma mirkanaa'aa ture
Someone has, but it wouldn't be him.	Namni tokko qaba, garuu isa hin ta'u ture.
A lot of things.	Waan baay'ee.
I think you should give it a chance	Carraa kennuu qabdu jedheen yaada
But there was no other.	Kan biraa garuu hin turre.
I can eat them though	Ani garuu isaan nyaachuu nan danda'a
I was happy to see her	Anis ishee arguu kootti gammadeera
I had nothing for him	Homaa isaaf hin qabu ture
It's a good picture.	Suuraa gaarii dha.
This is not one of them	Kun isaan keessaa tokko miti
I didn’t have to do anything, you did it all	Homaa gochuun na hin barbaachifne, ati hunda goote
Not so much today.	Har'a hangas miti.
These people are not real.	Namoonni kun dhugaa miti.
Every single person there .	Namni tokko tokko achi jiru hundi .
It's just like that.	Akkas qofa.
I saw it but I just couldn’t believe it	Arge garuu amanuu qofa hin dandeenye
I was just doing it.	Ani qofa hojjechaa ture.
I don’t need this.	Kana na hin barbaachisu.
She had to say it.	Jechuu qabdi turte.
I didn’t want to know the answer	Deebii isaa beekuu hin barbaanne
Much more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee.
I didn’t see her.	Ani ishee hin argine.
Tonight this is one of them	Halkan kana kun isaan keessaa tokko
I didn’t want you to have any part of it	Kutaa tokkollee akka ati qabdu hin barbaanne
I can't believe he's doing this to me	Akkas na gochaa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
But our time, my time, will never come.	Garuu yeroon keenya, yeroon koo, gonkumaa hin dhufu.
He had nowhere else to go	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin qabu ture
That was not good at all.	Sun tasumaa gaarii hin turre.
He doesn’t have to tell me twice.	Yeroo lama natti himuu hin qabu.
Just why, I didn’t know.	Maaliif qofa, hin beeku ture.
She was right about everything.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa irratti sirrii turte.
It can be really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
It sounds too simple to be true, but it works.	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee salphaa fakkaata, garuu ni hojjeta.
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
I can see them.	Isaan arguu nan danda'a.
He could have done that.	Kana gochuu dandaʼa ture.
Almost no one knows, she said.	Namni beeku hin jiru jechuun ni danda'ama jette.
There is that.	Sana jira.
I am currently watching them.	Yeroo ammaa isaan ilaalaa jira.
You need money.	Maallaqa si barbaachisa.
I came just as he did	Anis yeroo inni dhufe sanatti dhufe
What he needed was a reputation.	Wanti isa barbaachisu maqaa gaarii qabaachuu ture.
I couldn't see why this was true.	Kun maaliif dhugaa akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye.
Of course, this is not exactly the case.	Kun sirriitti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He has no children	Ijoollee hin qabu
It’s on the doorstep now.	Amma balbala irra jira.
No one noticed her, no one looked her way.	Namni ishee hin hubanne, namni karaa ishee ilaale hin jiru.
I won't say more	Kana caalaa hin jedhu
Me, not so good.	Ana, akkas gaarii miti.
It was in his eyes.	Ija isaa keessa ture.
I told him it wasn’t a good idea	Yaada gaarii akka hin taane itti hime
I didn’t make any big mistakes	Dogoggora guddaa tokkollee hin hojjenne
It makes them yours.	Kan keessan isaan godha.
This was a new life.	Kun jireenya haaraa ture.
I can't say much about my father	Waa'ee abbaa koo baay'ee dubbachuu hin danda'u
I didn't intend for it to happen	Akka ta'uuf hin yaadne
One had no money.	Tokko qarshii hin qabdu turte.
It was at her place, like school.	Bakka ishee ture, akka mana barumsaa.
I really want to meet them.	Isaan waliin wal arguu baay'een barbaada.
No one had ever done that before.	Kanaan dura namni akkas godhe hin beeku.
I know where you were	Bakka akka turte nan beeka
But there was nothing in the room to help her.	Garuu kutaa sana keessa wanti ishee gargaaru hin turre.
I don't understand why you want to come back here	Maaliif akka as deebi'uu barbaaddu naaf hin galle
I didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
Hope is not enough.	Abdiin gahaa miti.
I want to go to the moon	Ji'a keessa deemuun barbaada
I knew this answer, to some extent	Deebii kana nan beeka ture, hamma tokko
I still think about him	Ammallee waa'ee isaa nan yaada
You're going to be fine.	Ati gaarii ta'uuf jirta.
I can't give it to you	Siif kennuu hin danda'u
I certainly don’t need it	Akka na hin barbaachifne beekamaadha
There she was, the girl he loved.	Achi turte, intala inni jaallatu.
I just didn’t know what to do	Waan godhu qofa hin beeku ture
So he stays there for a while.	Kanaaf yeroo muraasaaf achi jiraata.
But that certainly wasn’t the problem.	Garuu rakkoon sun akkas akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I'm up here.	Ani as ol jira.
It was too obvious.	Garmalee ifa ture.
More than emotion.	Miira caalaa.
It was real life.	Jireenya dhugaa ture.
Not much more than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee hin jiru.
I couldn’t stay any longer	Kana booda turuu hin dandeenye
I didn't like to ask her much at the time	Yeroo sanatti waan baay'ee ishee gaafachuu hin jaalladhu ture
You’re better off not doing it.	Osoo hin goone siif wayya.
I think we all have some	Hundi keenya hamma tokko qabna jedheen yaada
Just people who do that.	Namoota akkas godhu qofa.
He wants the truth.	Dhugaa barbaada.
This is a mistake.	Kun dogoggora.
Getting back on track.	Karaa irra deebi'uu.
This need not be easy, however.	Kun garuu salphaa ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
Which couldn't be right.	Kan sirrii ta'uu hin dandeenye.
A long time ago	Yeroo dheeraa dura
So much around everything going on now.	Waan baay'ee naannoo waan hundumaa amma deemaa jiru.
So look into it now.	Kanaaf amma keessa ilaalaa.
Then she was different.	Sana booda adda turte.
I couldn’t believe this.	Kana amanuu hin dandeenye.
You can’t talk your way through this any more.	Kana irra karaa kee dubbachuu hin dandeessu.
You know a couple better than most.	Isin tokko lama irra caalaa beektu.
This can’t have been happening.	Kun ta’aa ture ta’uu hin danda’u.
Good ideas.	Yaada gaarii.
He wanted another one.	Kan biraa barbaade.
He had this idea here and now	Yaada kana asitti fi amma qaba ture
It’s just her luck.	Carraa ishee qofa.
he thought to himself	jedhee yaade
I'm pretty sure that works	Sun akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa dha
It can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u.
Maybe it shouldn’t exist.	Tarii jiraachuu hin qabu.
But I don’t think it really matters anymore	Kana booda garuu dhuguma dhimma hin qabu jedheen yaada
Of course I did.	Akkan godhe beekamaadha.
So look at me now.	Kanaaf amma na ilaalaa.
I know that's a bad thing	Sun waan hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka
He has a lot to do.	Waan baay'ee gochuu qaba.
They knew it would never be anything else.	Yoomiyyuu waan biraa akka hin taane ni beeku turan.
I can never get enough	Ani gonkumaa gahaa argachuu hin danda'u
I knew it was an accident	Balaa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
He knew with his eyes, that he was gone	Ija isaatiin beeka ture, akka hin jirre
I had to do something quickly	Dafee waan tokko gochuun qaba ture
I couldn’t see her like that	Akkasitti ishee arguu hin dandeenye
I couldn’t do any of this without you	Si malee kana keessaa tokkollee gochuu hin dandeenye
All looked good.	Hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
It’s okay, I told myself	Homaa miti jedheen ofitti hime
But it was during the day.	Garuu guyyaa ture.
You need to know this.	Kana beekuu qabda.
I wouldn't have done it, otherwise	Silaa hin godhu ture, osoo akkas ta'ee
Often, though, this is not the case.	Yeroo baayʼee garuu akkas miti.
I'm doing a lot more now.	Amma kana caalaa waan baay'ee hojjechaa jira.
There was no one in there.	Namni achi keessa hin turre.
He looked at it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ilaale.
Once he saw her.	Yeroo tokko ishee arge.
But he is not the same person.	Garuu inni nama tokko miti.
I mean, what more could you ask for?.	Kana caalaa maal gaafachuu dandeessu jechuu kooti?.
Maybe it's a human being.	Tarii nama ta'uu danda'a.
I think he will be fine with his help	Gargaarsa isaatiin gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
He knew all this but couldn’t tell anyone.	Kana hunda beeka ture garuu namatti himuu hin dandeenye.
They can still do it.	Ammas ni danda'u.
I think it will ever happen	Yoomiyyuu ni ta'a jedheen yaada
Unless you are a human being.	Yoo nama taate malee.
I already knew him well	Duraan akka gaariitti isa beeka ture
He should have done better	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu qaba ture
I had my chance with him	Carraa koo isa waliin qaba ture
He didn’t look bad.	Inni hamaa hin fakkaatu ture.
How everyone looked up to him.	Akkamitti namni hundi ol jedhee isa ilaale.
I need to go somewhere	Bakka tokko deemuun na barbaachisa
I am of course from duty	Ani dirqama irraa akkan ta'e beekamaadha
All my time is mine.	Yeroon koo hundi kan kooti.
The simple feeling of not being alone	Miira salphaa kophaa ta'uu dhiisuu
You know a little bit.	Waan xiqqoo beektu.
You can’t do more than that.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
Sometimes I can see more.	Yeroo tokko tokko caalaatti arguu dandaʼa.
I know your feelings	Miira kee nan beeka
It was obviously out of duty.	Dirqama irraa akka ture ifaadha.
We still have feelings.	Ammallee miira qabna.
That’s how it worked back then.	Yeroo sanatti akkasitti hojjeta ture.
From the girl? 	Intala irraa?
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
It must have been true again.	Ammas dhugaa ture ta'uu qaba.
He knew something was wrong	Waan tokko akka dogoggora taʼe beeka ture
I hadn’t seen her in so long	Yeroo dheeraa akkasii keessatti ishee hin argine ture
He has already spoken.	Duraan dubbateera.
Never more so than this.	Gonkumaa kana caalaa hin taane.
I can't believe this is happening.	Kun ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
He wouldn’t intend to help	Gargaaruuf hin yaadu ture
Maybe they do better.	Tarii kana caalaa hojjetu ta'a.
He might know what that is	Sun maal akka taʼe beekuu dandaʼa
Lots of work to get things going.	Hojii baay'ee waan tokko akka deemu gochuuf.
That was obvious.	Sun ifa ture.
I mean, you never know	Ati gonkumaa hin beektu jechuu kooti
They often, even have a lot.	Yeroo baayʼee, baayʼee illee qabu.
He had no sense of time	Miira yeroo hin qabu ture
They are not dangerous.	Isaan balaa hin qaban.
He wouldn't do that unless it was necessary	Yoo barbaachisaa ta'e malee akkas hin godhu ture
Like, really, really great.	Akka, dhuguma, dhuguma guddaa.
I was sure she was.	Akka isheen taate mirkanaa'aa ture.
I want more, much more	Kana caalaa, kana caalaa baayyee barbaada
It was two years ago.	Waggaa lama dura ture.
I still enjoyed it	Ammas itti gammadeera
He was always in his lab.	Yeroo hunda mana yaalaa isaa keessa ture.
But there will be more to come.	Garuu kana caalaa kan dhufu ni jiraata.
I don't know why that happened.	Maaliif akkas ta'e hin beeku.
It shouldn't be one big issue.	Dhimma guddaa tokko ta'uu hin qabu.
It wasn’t much of a problem	Rakkoo guddaa hin qabu ture
That would have been the right thing to do.	Silaa wanti sirrii ta'e sun ture.
I know that’s not true	Sun dhugaa akka hin taane nan beeka
I know that he knows.	Inni akka beeku nan beeka.
She wasn’t as tall as he was.	Isheen akka isaa dheeraa hin turre.
I just can't do it yet	Ammallee gochuu hin danda'u qofa
I mean, you have no money	Maallaqa hin qabdu jechuu kooti
I wanted to do as he asked	Anis akkuma inni gaafate gochuu barbaade
It is certainly not dangerous.	Balaa akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
But you don't.	Garuu hin gootu.
It's just an answer.	Deebii qofa.
I can't get enough of him	Isa irraa gahaa argachuu hin danda'u
He said we did that.	Akkas goone jedhe.
It wasn’t just my time to go.	Yeroon koo yeroon itti deemu qofa hin turre.
I want to work with him	Isa waliin hojjechuu barbaada
He was pleased with himself.	Ofitti gammade.
Something was wrong with this.	Kana irratti wanti tokko dogoggora ture.
I can't believe what you just said	Waan amma jette amanuu hin danda'u
We have a guy.	Gurbaa tokko qabna.
I just need it to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuuf qofa na barbaachisa.
This couldn’t be happening.	Kun ta’aa jiraachuu hin danda’u ture.
It was something we did.	Waan hojjenne ture.
I want to believe that.	Sana amanuu barbaada.
They work with me.	Ana waliin hojjetu.
This can’t be the case.	Kun ta’uu hin danda’u.
You people are really doing your job well.	Isin namoonni dhuguma hojii keessan akka gaariitti hojjechaa jirtu.
But that was out there.	Garuu sun ala ture.
That was what mattered.	Wanti barbaachisaa ture kanuma ture.
It wasn’t a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa hin turre.
This seems likely.	Kun waan ta'uu danda'u fakkaata.
I couldn't have asked for more	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture
He had his moments.	Yeroo isaa qaba ture.
She had no time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu hin qabdu turte.
We need time.	Yeroo nu barbaachisa.
It was just one of those nights.	Halkan sana keessaa tokko qofa ture.
Keep going!.	Itti deemaa!.
There wasn't much time left.	Yeroon baay'een hin turre ture.
So there was no one.	Kanaaf namni tokkollee hin turre.
I said it was okay	Anis homaa miti jedheen
I could have left it at that	Silaa akkasitti dhiisuu nan danda'a ture
I love this time of year	Yeroo waggaa kana baay'een jaalladha
I was sure you didn't want me	Akka ati na hin barbaanne mirkanaa'aa ture
They have no children	Ijoollee hin qaban
It wasn’t there yet.	Ammallee hin turre.
Sometimes there is a reason to do so.	Yeroo tokko tokko sababni akkas gochuu qabnu jira.
But they may not be.	Garuu ta’uu dhiisuu danda’u.
Once he found his mother.	Yeroo tokko haadha isaa argate.
I don’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabu.
I really think so	Dhuguma akkas natti fakkaata
I suspect it requires a lot of money	Maallaqa baayyee barbaada jedheen shakka
I just thought I would.	Anis jedheen yaada qofa.
I am no longer alone	Kana booda kophaa koo miti
Many come to us.	Baay'een gara keenya dhufu.
But he is right.	Garuu inni sirrii dha.
No problem with office hours	Sa'aatii hojii irratti rakkoo hin qabu
So I didn't talk about it	Kanaaf waa'ee isaa hin dubbanne
But it is necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa dha.
He should have known something was wrong	Silaa waan tokko dogoggora ta'uu beekuu qaba ture
All are in good to very good condition.	Hundi isaanii haala gaarii hanga baayyee gaarii irra jiru.
But she’s right.	Garuu isheen sirrii dha.
I wasn’t one of those people	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko hin turre
I know you don’t want to.	Akka hin barbaanne nan beeka.
I will never go there again	Kana booda yoomiyyuu achi hin deemu
This is sometimes not the case.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko akkas miti.
I don’t have to be in a bad mood over a dress	Uffata tokko irratti miira hamaa keessa jiraachuu hin qabu
I was with her on the inside, not on the outside looking in	Ani ala keessa ilaalaa osoo hin taane keessa ishee waliin ture
That’s what I started with.	Kanaan jalqabe.
You shouldn’t have done it.	Silaa gochuu hin qabdu turte.
I hoped he could.	Inni akka danda'u abdiin qaba ture.
I am going to go to them.	Ani gara isaanii deemuuf jira.
I can't live in both places	Bakka lamaan jiraachuu hin danda'u
They didn’t have shoes in those days.	Bara sanatti kophee hin qaban turan.
I don't do that now.	Amma akkas hin godhu.
I haven’t done that yet	Ani hanga ammaatti akkas hin goone
I must apologize to you	Dhiifama keessan gaafachuu qaba
He is right.	Inni sirrii dha.
It’s not too late.	Yeroo booda miti.
I want to do something about that.	Sana irratti waan tokko gochuu barbaada.
Maybe it was too soon.	Tarii dafee ture ta'a.
Until then, I had no problems.	Hanga sanatti rakkoo hin qabu ture.
He knew he would, if it were her.	Inni akka godhu beeka ture, osoo ishee ta'ee.
I just really needed them	Ani garuu dhuguma isaan barbaachisa ture
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Now maybe I need to do that.	Amma tarii akkas gochuun na barbaachisa.
I doubt it is.	Ta'uu isaa nan shakka.
But this is my job.	Garuu kun hojii kooti.
It stayed like this all day.	Guyyaa guutuu akkasitti ture.
He knows we were in the right.	Inni sirrii keessa akka turre ni beeka.
It sounds like a joke.	Qoosaa fakkaata.
That's it.	Kanuma.
No one asked for money.	Namni qarshii gaafate hin jiru.
She was once.	Yeroo tokko turte.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
You can only tell.	Ati qofa himuu dandeessa.
I don’t have it.	Ani hin qabu.
It’s dangerous there.	Achitti balaa qaba.
Was.	Ture.
He seems to love the wife.	Haadha manaa akka jaallatu fakkaata.
He wasn’t with anyone else.	Nama biraa waliin hin turre.
I certainly don't want to be like that.	Ani akkas ta'uu akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
I thought it was pretty good	Baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate
This was her home now, their home.	Kun amma mana ishee ture, mana isaanii ture.
Hopefully it will be a great year.	Bara guddaa akka ta'u abdii qabna.
John was not one of them.	Yohaannis isaan keessaa tokko hin turre.
I mean the car, this guy	Konkolaataa jechuu kooti, ​​gurbaa kana
It was still a very long year.	Ammallee waggaa baayyee dheeraa ture.
He did so often.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas godha ture.
Not sure it totally worked.	Guutummaatti akka hojjete mirkanaa'aa miti.
If not, fine.	Yoo hin taane gaarii.
I said that might not be a bad idea.	Sun yaada hamaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a jedheen ture.
I could have been there for him more	Silaa kana caalaa isaaf achi jiraachuu nan danda'a ture
Now I have an idea.	Amma yaada qaba.
But he didn't go away for long.	Inni garuu yeroo dheeraaf hin deemne.
I need some sleep	Hirriba xiqqoo na barbaachisa
I certainly knew what had happened	Waan taʼe akkan beeku beekamaadha
I knew we could do it	Akka gochuu dandeenyu nan beeka ture
Full though.	Guutuu garuu.
I could have done something	Silaa waan tokko gochuu nan danda'a ture
I hope it can help us	Akka nu gargaaruu danda'u abdiin qaba
I didn’t want any of them	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
It was great.	Guddaa ture.
I never make it up.	Gonkumaa ol hin godhu.
That’s not at all certain.	Sun gonkumaa mirkanaa’aa miti.
It shouldn't be now.	Amma ta'uu hin qabu.
He should have known something wasn’t right	Silaa wanti tokko sirrii akka hin taane beekuu qaba ture
He knows exactly what you want	Waan ati barbaaddu sirriitti beeka
Exactly this way.	Sirriitti karaa kanaan.
It looked like that.	Akkas fakkaata ture.
Not that one.	Isa sana miti.
If he finds one.	Yoo tokko argate.
I want it here tomorrow	Boru as barbaada
I wonder who gave it to me	Eenyutu naaf kenne jedheen yaada
This was right.	Kun sirrii ture.
I absolutely love them	Ani guutummaatti isaan jaalladha
It shouldn’t have worked that way.	Akkasitti hojjechuu hin qabu ture.
I think they have.	Akka qaban natti fakkaata.
I was obviously in danger	Balaa keessa akkan ture ifaadha
Maybe he was right.	Tarii sirrii ture ta'a.
I could ask you the same thing	Anis kanuma si gaafachuu nan danda'a ture
Everything else is possible.	Wanti biraa hundi ta'uu danda'a.
I disagree with that comment	Ani yaada sana irratti walii hin galle
I want to do my best.	Waan danda'u hunda gochuu nan barbaada.
It will never be enough.	Gonkumaa gahaa hin ta'u.
You know, it eats.	Beektaa nyaata.
This is all my stuff.	Kun waan koo hunda.
I didn’t do anything to them	Ani homaa isaan hin hojjenne
It looked like that.	Akkas fakkaata ture.
I love you, but it’s not like that.	Si jaalladha malee akkas miti.
I didn’t want to mother him	Ani isa haadha gochuu hin barbaanne
This is not the right thing to do.	Kun waan sirrii miti.
I thought it was because of his mother	Sababa haadha isaatiin natti fakkaate
I’ve been watching you	Si ilaalaa tureera
Nothing seemed right to us.	Wanti sirrii nutti fakkaate hin jiru.
This is not the case at all.	Kun tasumaa akkas miti.
She didn't know what to do.	Waan gootu hin beekne.
I didn't understand this either	Anis kana hin hubanne
What works for me may not work for you.	Wanti naaf hojjetu siif hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
It’s not you.	Si miti.
You can tell me then.	Yeroo sana natti himuu dandeessu.
When, of course, that wasn’t the case.	Yeroo, beekamaadha, akkas hin turre.
She had questions about the passion.	Waa'ee fedhii sanaa gaaffii qabdi turte.
I said sorry many times.	Yeroo baay'ee dhiifama jedheen ture.
I’m very happy with my idea	Yaada kootti baay’een gammade
I can't go back on them	Isaan irratti duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
It can never be.	Gonkumaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
It has many problems.	Rakkoo hedduu qaba.
There was no one here.	Asitti namni tokkollee hin turre.
I didn’t see her in the afternoon.	Waaree booda ishee hin argine.
I love him very much.	Baay'een isa jaalladha.
This was one for him.	Kun isaaf tokko ture.
It can be very different in your home.	Mana keessan keessatti baayʼee adda taʼuu dandaʼa.
Time was not an issue.	Yeroon dhimma hin turre.
You don't know what's in it.	Waan keessa jiru hin beektu.
I wasn’t there yet	Ani ammallee achi hin turre
As it should be.	Akkuma ta'uu qabu.
He needs to know how	Akkamitti akka ta'e beekuu qaba
I hadn’t thought of it that way	Akkasitti hin yaadne ture
I really just can't do it.	Dhuguma qofa gochuu hin danda'u.
I did it and we did it.	Ani godhe nuti hojjenne.
No idea how much it is now	Amma meeqa akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
This is exactly wrong.	Kun sirriitti dogoggora.
Then, now he went.	Sana booda, amma deeme.
There is none of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
There is still time.	Ammas yeroon jira.
You could have done better!.	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa turte!.
I couldn't go back now	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
She can’t seem to find her voice.	Sagalee ishee argachuu waan hin dandeenye fakkaata.
But I didn't think it was real	Ani garuu waan dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
I know what this thing does	Wanti kun maal akka hojjetu nan beeka
I think we're good	Gaarii ta'uu keenya natti fakkaata
I didn’t know you were kidding	Akka ati qoosaa jirtu hin beeku ture
But it’s not without risk.	Garuu balaa malee miti.
But this shouldn’t be the case for you.	Kun garuu siif ta’uu hin qabu.
No one knew what to do with it.	Namni maal akka itti godhu hin beeku ture.
He would have been there all along.	Silaa yeroo hundumaa achi jira ture.
I knew what was right	Waan sirrii taʼe nan beeka ture
They can see better than we can.	Nu caalaa arguu danda'u.
I could never have that again with my old friends	Hiriyyoota koo durii wajjin kana booda gonkumaa akkas qabaachuu hin dandeenye
I still wouldn’t have you.	Ammallee si hin qabu ture.
I thought you were older	Ati umuriin kee guddaa natti fakkaate
I knew it was him, it had to be	Isa akka ta'e nan beeka ture, ta'uu qaba
It doesn't do anything.	Homaa hin godhu.
I couldn’t afford one	Tokko bitachuu hin dandeenye
You still need it.	Ammas si barbaachisa.
The two men said nothing.	Namoonni lamaan homaa hin dubbanne.
Nothing more happens tonight.	Halkan kana kana caalaa wanti ta'u hin jiru.
This one will work.	Inni kun ni hojjeta.
I had to make this work	Kana akka hojjetu gochuun qaba ture
I told him that was true	Anis sun dhugaa akka taʼe itti hime
What was he trying to do.	Maal gochuuf yaalaa ture.
I never want to see you again	Amma booda gonkumaa si arguu hin barbaadu
You have to be clear about where you are going.	Bakka deemtu ifa ta'uu qabda.
He wasn’t there that year	Bara sana achi hin turre
They loved their children.	Ijoollee isaanii ni jaallatu turan.
But that wasn’t the only reason.	Garuu sababni isaa kana qofa hin turre.
That was a lot.	Sun baay'ee ture.
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun haala akkasii miti.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
I can never go back again	Kana booda gonkumaa duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
Not much, but still pretty good.	Baay'ee miti, garuu ammas baay'ee gaarii dha.
You have to find him.	Isa argachuu qabda.
I can tell him about my thoughts	Waa'ee yaada koo itti himuu nan danda'a
We don’t need a new one.	Haaraa nu hin barbaachisu.
What is there, now? 	Maaltu jira, amma?
I didn’t know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku ture.
. . . .	.
He had no father.	Abbaa hin qabu ture.
It’s not like it used to be.	Akka duraan ture miti.
I know that you know.	Akka ati beektu nan beeka.
I can't believe what just happened	Waan amma ta'e amanuu hin danda'u
It is in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jira.
I hadn’t thought of it that way before	Kana dura akkasitti hin yaadne ture
But after that.	Garuu sana booda.
That wouldn't be so easy.	Sun akkas salphaa hin ta'u ture.
Is everyone interested?.	Namni hundi fedhii qabaa?.
Nothing happened, everything was fine.	Homaa hin taane, wanti hundi gaarii ture.
Of course, he would not do such a thing.	Waan akkasii akka hin goone beekamaadha.
A lot of it didn't happen	Baay'een isaa hin taane
I told him it was one of one.	Tokko keessaa tokko akka ta'e itti hime.
No one wanted to do it.	Namni gochuu barbaade hin turre.
You’re doing the best you can right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana waan dandeessu hunda hojjechaa jirta.
Exactly what we need to do.	Sirriitti waan hojjechuu qabnu.
I didn’t want to go	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne
This shouldn't happen, but it does.	Kun ta'uu hin qabu, garuu ni ta'a.
This week will be a little different.	Torban kun xiqqoo adda ta'a.
He should have known he knew all about it	Silaa waa'ee isaa hunda akka beeku beekuu qaba ture
You are one of us.	Ati nu keessaa tokko.
I have to do this.	Kana gochuun qaba.
How much more was it.	Meeqa caalaa ture.
She is not there now.	Amma hin jirtu.
I want you to know everything he says	Waan inni jedhu hunda akka beektu nan barbaada
I'm not there.	Ani hin jiru.
It might have been, but it really wasn't.	Silaa ta'uu danda'a, garuu dhuguma hin turre.
I can't leave you.	Si dhiisuu hin danda'u.
I know all their answers	Deebii isaanii hunda nan beeka
I can't believe this	Kana amanuu hin danda'u
Easy like that.	Salphaa akkasitti.
None of them could have known anything of the latest.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waan haaraa kana irraa homaa beekuu hin danda'u ture.
This is a bit important.	Kun xiqqoo barbaachisaa dha.
It’s not in me.	Ana keessa hin jiru.
We do have some hope though.	Nuti garuu abdii tokko tokko qabna.
All of them, just people.	Hundi isaanii, namoota qofa.
Like children.	Akkuma ijoollee.
It must be said.	Jechuun dirqama.
I haven’t seen you in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf si hin argine
I know that part of it.	Kutaa isaa sana nan beeka.
It wasn’t my place.	Bakka koo hin turre.
That would be most accurate.	Sun hunda caalaa sirrii taʼa.
I mean, I think it's just light.	Kana jechuun koo, ifa qofa natti fakkaata jechuu kooti.
He did that to me last week.	Torban darbe akkas na godhe.
Everything seemed so wrong.	Wanti hundi akka malee dogoggora fakkaata ture.
I think that is very important	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
He shouldn’t have told anyone	Namatti himuu hin qabu ture
That’s her there.	Sun ishee achitti.
It seemed easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata ture.
If so, it didn't work.	Yoo akkas ta'e hin hojjenne.
I know you’re right.	Sirrii akka taate nan beeka.
This time had to be right	Yeroon kun sirrii ta’uu qaba ture
I know you know it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu akka beektu nan beeka.
Which is the real thing.	Kan dhugaa ta'e.
He knew what he had done.	Waan kana godhe ni beeka ture.
But our work is still clear.	Garuu hojiin keenya ammallee ifaadha.
He never wanted to.	Inni gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
I'm working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa jira.
I didn’t want to be here anymore	Kana booda as jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I haven’t seen him in three years now	Amma waggaa sadii booda isa hin argine
He needs to know why you need him	Maaliif akka si barbaachisu beekuu qaba
I couldn’t make another mistake	Dogoggora biraa hojjechuu hin dandeenye
I mean, he was that person, but he wasn't	Nama sana ture jechuu kooti, ​​hin turre malee
I can't leave her.	Ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u.
You have it.	Ati adda.
Not really there.	Dhuguma achi miti.
I don’t have to answer it	Deebii itti kennuu hin qabu
He should know better than that.	Kana caalaa beekuu qaba.
He should have quit then	Silaa yeroo sanatti dhiisuu qaba ture
I never did it.	Ani gonkumaa hin goone.
Nowadays everyone can do that.	Yeroo ammaa kana namni hundi sana gochuu danda'a.
She was not altruistic.	Isheen kan of kennuu hin turre.
Seems.	Fakkaata.
You two guard the door.	Isin lamaan balbala eegaa.
I have always enjoyed you	Yeroo hundumaa sitti gammadeera
I looked up at him.	Ol jedheen isa ilaale.
I know it's mine.	Kan koo akka ta'e nan beeka.
In time, he got to know them better	Yeroo booda baayʼee isaan beeka ture
But I knew it.	Ani garuu nan beeka ture.
I knew he would never do that again	Kana booda waan akkasii akka hin goone nan beeka ture
He may be an old man.	Inni nama durii ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t see it that way.	Akkasitti hin argine.
Playing with her, against her, in her mouth.	Ishee waliin taphachuu, ishee irratti, afaan ishee keessaa.
I didn’t need anything else	Waan biraa na hin barbaachifne
No one should ever see them.	Namni tokkollee gonkumaa isaan arguu hin qabu.
But this time I don't know the answer.	Yeroo kana garuu deebii isaa hin beeku.
It was three hours later.	Sa'aatii sadii booda ture.
He says they will.	Ni godhu jedha.
But you had it.	Garuu qabda turte.
There had to be a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni jiraachuu qaba ture.
I thought you did that earlier	Duraan akkas goote natti fakkaate
I think it's a lot.	Baayyee natti fakkaata.
That should be enough for him.	Sun isaaf gahaa ta’uu qaba.
That is very important.	Sun baayʼee barbaachisaa dha.

I want to find them more than anything.	Isaan argachuu waan hundumaa caalaa barbaada.
He wanted to know her.	Ishee beekuu barbaade.
No one is going to tell you what to do.	Namni maal akka gootu sitti himu hin jiru.
I really want to help	Gargaaruu baay'een barbaada
No one else has walked in your shoes.	Namni biraa kophee kee keessa deeme hin jiru.
Go back three years.	Waggaa sadii dura deemaa.
No one else was around.	Namni biraa naannoo sana hin turre.
Here, there was no problem.	Asitti, rakkoon hin turre.
I can tell these things	Wantoota kana himuu nan danda'a
There may be no reason.	Sababni hin jiru ta'a.
I love that so much	Sana baay'een jaalladha
I can’t seem to do that	Ani akkas gochuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
Not my parents’ lives.	Jireenya warra koo miti.
There’s more to come, of course.	Kan biraa kan dhufu akka jiru beekamaadha.
I thought they were just acting	Isaan taphachuu qofa natti fakkaate
That's what it's supposed to be.	Sun ta'uu qaba.
Things were not like that in real life	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti wanti akkas hin turre
No one wants to talk to me.	Namni na waliin dubbachuu barbaadu hin jiru.
But people weren’t supposed to know that.	Garuu namoonni kana beekuu hin qaban turan.
He came inside.	Gara keessaa dhufe.
We are in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirra.
I wanted to be him.	Ani isa ta'uu barbaade.
We couldn’t have done it without her.	Osoo ishee malee gochuu hin dandeenyu ture.
They waited there, did nothing.	Achitti eegaa turan, homaa hin goone.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
I was watching him a lot.	Baay'een isa ilaalaa ture.
He started that one.	Isa sana jalqabe.
I have no idea whatsoever	Ani yaada tokkollee hin qabu

He had nothing to say	Waan jedhu hin qabu ture
You don't do anything.	Ati homaa hin gootu.
You never know.	Ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
He never does that.	Inni gonkumaa akkas hin godhu.
I absolutely love it	Ani guutummaatti nan jaalladha
I hope to be a good wife	Haadha manaa gaarii ta'uuf abdiin qaba
None of them are true.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee dhugaa miti.
He should have known sooner	Silaa dafee beekuu qaba ture
I hope someone here can help.	Namni as jiru tokko akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
But, I didn’t see it coming.	Garuu, dhufuu isaa hin argine.
It might be for you.	Siif ta'uu danda'a.
There is no one on them.	Namni isaan irra hin jiru.
Not much, just a little bit.	Baay'ee miti xiqqoo qofa.
But for a while he doesn't	Yeroo muraasaaf garuu hin qabu
They were doing it.	Gochaa turan.
But it would just leave me alone.	Garuu na dhiisuu qofa ture.
I have more money than you think	Maallaqa ati yaaddu caalaa qaba
It looks a lot like a car.	Baayyee konkolaataa fakkaata.
It wasn’t easy.	Salphaa hin turre.
This didn't seem likely.	Kun waan ta'uu danda'u hin fakkaatu ture.
It sounds good.	Sagalee gaarii dha.
I need it to happen quickly though	Dafee akka ta'u garuu na barbaachisa
But nothing like that happened.	Garuu wanti akkasii hin taane.

Everything, at that moment, is the same.	Wanti hundi, yeroo sanatti, tokko.
But they still have each other.	Garuu ammallee wal qabu.

You are two people.	Isin nama lama.

It had to be one of you.	Isin keessaa tokko ta'uu qaba ture.
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.

But I would do what she wanted	Ani garuu waan isheen barbaaddu nan godha ture
It wasn’t bad for him.	Isaaf hamaa hin turre.
I didn’t want to do that.	Kana gochuu hin barbaanne.

I knew nothing about my father	Waa'ee abbaa koo homaa hin beeku ture
We are really lucky.	Dhuguma carraa qabna.

Then something is going to happen.	Sana booda wanti tokko ta'uuf jira.
The long one this time	Kan dheeraa yeroo kana
Not saying much about that.	Waa'ee sanaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu miti.
I think for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf jedheen yaada

Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
I couldn’t see it then	Yeroo sana arguu hin dandeenye

I didn't think he could do it on his own	Ofii isaatiin waan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu ture
It didn’t look like me anymore	Kana booda na hin fakkaatu ture
I want it to come in my mouth	Afaan koo keessa akka dhufu nan barbaada

We just talked about it.	Isa dubbanne qofa.
He knows that, now.	Inni sana beeka, amma.
It’s a mistake.	Dogoggora dha.
I didn't think so.	Akkasitti hin yaadne.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
I know you know that, girl	Kana akka beektu nan beeka intala
You know that you are.	Akka taate beekta.
He had a real job.	Hojii dhugaa qaba ture.
Everything is fine so far.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi gaarii dha.
He can't seem to do it and needs some help.	Hojjechuu waan hin dandeenye fakkaata gargaarsa tokko tokko barbaada.
If we have to meet here.	Yoo asitti wal arguu qabna ta'e.

You think so.	Akkas jettanii yaaddu.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a.
Which she is not.	Kan isheen hin taane.
He was great.	Inni guddaa ture.
She was right, he didn’t understand.	Isheen sirrii turte, inni hin hubanne.
But sometimes I think about it	Yeroo tokko tokko garuu itti yaada
That was not the case in the bar case.	Dhimma mana dhugaatii keessatti akkas hin turre.
I am still with you.	Hanga ammaatti si waliin jira.
I think he might have	Inni qabaachuu danda'a jedheen yaada
They, of course, did not.	Isaan, akkas akka hin goone beekamaadha.
I just can't see the problem.	Rakkoo jiru qofa arguu hin danda'u.
It seems like a mistake	Dogoggora fakkaata
I want to make something happen	Waan tokko akka ta'u gochuu barbaada
That said, it does a good job.	Kana jechuun hojii gaarii hojjeta.
He wanted that.	Inni akkas barbaada ture.
So it works both ways.	Kanaaf karaa lamaan hojjeta.
I knew what he was doing right	Waan inni sirriitti hojjechaa jiru nan beeka ture
He is not here now.	Amma as hin jiru.
I’m always trying new things	Yeroo hundumaa waan haaraa yaalaa jira
So maybe later.	Kanaaf tarii booda.
I knew this house.	Mana kana nan beeka ture.
I don't know if this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
I suspect this was not true	Kun dhugaa akka hin turre nan shakka
A couple thoughts on this.	Yaada lama lama kana irratti.
I can't make you do it.	Akka ati gootu si gochuu hin danda'u.
Love how this turned out!.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'e jaalladhu!.
They were real people.	Namoota dhugaa turan.
There was no one outside.	Namni ala hin turre.
It should be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu qaba.
I didn’t want to see that episode again	Kutaa sana kana booda arguu hin barbaanne
Everyone wants to do that.	Namni hundi akkas gochuu barbaada.
I just couldn’t tell anyone	Namatti himuu qofa hin dandeenye
Something like that.	Waan akkasii tokko tokko.
You need something else.	Waan biraa si barbaachisa.

Some people are lucky.	Namoonni tokko tokko carraa qabu.
I didn't see her.	Ishee hin argine.
But that’s not the father there.	Garuu sun abbaa achi miti.
Now I'm not so sure.	Amma akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I know you still have it	Ammallee akka qabdu nan beeka
I wasn’t looking at her the whole time	Yeroo guutuu ishee ilaalaa hin turre
Wait a little longer.	Xiqqoo eegaa.
I still have a lot of work to do	Ammallee hojii baay'een qaba
I can't do anything now	Amma homaa gochuu hin danda'u
I know nothing else.	Kana malee homaa hin beeku.
Feeling, feeling	Miira, miira
I think it might be possible	Ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
He lived just around the corner from my house.	Mana koo irraa naannoo qofa jiraata ture.
I shouldn’t have asked	Silaa gaafachuu hin qabu ture
Everything is the same thing.	Wanti hundi waan tokko.
I want that feeling again	Miira sana ammas barbaada
I thought it was easy.	Salphaa natti fakkaate.
But not often.	Garuu yeroo baayyee miti.
Last year I was on nothing	Waggaa darbe homaa irra hin turre
I wondered how that would work	Sun akkamitti hojjeta jedheen yaade
I had no idea what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I was with my friends	Hiriyyoota koo waliin ture
Good night, my daughter.	Halkan gaarii intala koo.
There is no one.	Namni hin jiru.
He already knew he was no help	Gargaarsa tokkollee akka hin taane duruu beeka ture
They want to make it look good.	Gaarii akka fakkaatu gochuu barbaadu.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
I need you to do me the right big favor	Tola guddaa sirrii akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa
This was a bit risky.	Kun xiqqoo balaa qaba ture.
Purpose.	Dhimma.
That can't be the case.	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u.
So far, it seems.	Hanga ammaatti fakkaata.
It’s my mother.	Haadha kooti.
I wanted to tell him the real reason.	Sababni dhugaa dhufe itti himuu barbaade.
This was wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.	Kun dogoggora dogoggora dogoggora dogoggora dogoggora dogoggora ture.
I just can't be sure	Ani garuu mirkanaa'aa ta'uu hin danda'u
In the hour she was gone.	Sa'aatii keessatti isheen hin jirre.
We don’t have that.	Nuti akkas hin qabnu.
Nobody was about.	Namni waa'ee hin turre.
But it’s not mine to say.	Garuu jechuun kan koo miti.
I don’t really care.	Ani dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
Again, this is not true.	Ammas kun dhugaa miti.
But they are not like us.	Isaan garuu akka keenya miti.
They had to do something different.	Waan adda taʼe hojjechuu qabu turan.
She didn’t like to ask for anything.	Homaa gaafachuu hin jaallattu turte.
What was that.	Maal ture sun.
I didn’t have it before	Kana dura hin qabu ture
How can it be.	Akkamitti ta'uu danda'a.
I was the only one who understood me	Kan na hubate ana qofa ture
We should be looking at all other avenues.	Karaa biraa hunda ilaalaa jiraachuu qabna.
Many people.	Namoonni baay'een.
He has a desire.	Fedhii qaba.
I think it’s still there	Ammallee waan jiru natti fakkaata
I'm thinking about it.	Ani itti yaada.
What's going on here.	Waan asitti deemaa jiru.
Just the two of you.	Isin lamaan qofa.
He was very clear.	Inni baayyee ifa ture.
I'm pretty sure you can go without it though.	Ani garuu akka ati isa malee deemuu dandeessu baay'ee mirkanaa'aa dha.
I always have someone who loves me the most	Yeroo hundumaa nama hunda caalaa na jaallatu qaba
You have a lot of time ahead of you.	Yeroon baay'ee si dura jira.
Look at it like this.	Akkasitti ilaalaa.
From the car.	Konkolaataa irraa.
He thought about it for a moment	Yeroo muraasaaf itti yaade
He didn't say anything else	Waan biraa hin dubbanne
I still don't know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e ammallee hin beeku.
It was a bad day at work.	Hojii irratti guyyaa hamaa ture.
Here in this section.	As kutaa kana keessatti.
We were friends.	Hiriyyoota turre.
I don’t know what to think	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku
That's why they say.	Kanaaf jedhu.
I’m not saying you can’t.	Hin dandeessu jechuu koo miti.
I certainly wasn’t there again	Ammas achi akkan hin turre beekamaadha
I can't fill it for you	Siif guutuu hin danda'u
Just ask a few questions before, during and after.	Duraan, yeroo fi booda gaaffii muraasa gaafachuu qofa.
That’s how it started, really.	Akkasitti jalqabe, dhuguma.
I probably don't know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beeku ta'a.
I didn’t see you there	Achitti si hin argine
Not after this morning.	Ganama kana booda miti.
I'm enjoying it	Ani itti gammadeera
I can't really see anything else	Dhuguma waan biraa arguu hin danda'u
I really think of her a lot	Dhuguma baay'een ishee yaada
His father, his father’s father, everything.	Abbaa isaa, abbaa abbaa isaa, waan hundumaa.
Nothing happened for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf wanti ta'e hin jiru.
It didn't look too good tonight.	Halkan kana baayyee gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
I don't understand the reason for this	Sababni kanaa naaf hin galle
But that's not what happened here.	Garuu asitti kan ta'e akkas miti.
He knows me so very little.	Inni akkas baayyee xiqqoo na beeka.
One of the many.	Baay'ee keessaa tokko.
I don't have one idea in common with them	Ani yaada tokko isaan waliin wal fakkaatu hin qabu
They were good people.	Isaan namoota gaarii turan.
I mean, the night was great	Halkan sun guddaa ture jechuu kooti
We have a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee qabna.
But it's happening.	Garuu ta'aa jira.
I couldn't leave him here alone	Kophaa isaa asitti isa dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I'm sure we all did it.	Hundi keenya akka hojjenne mirkanaa'adha.
I knew it was a problem.	Rakkoo akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
I told him to back off, but he doesn't	Duubatti deebi'i jedheen ture, garuu hin godhu
She was in the .	Isheen keessa turte .
They should do this.	Kana gochuu qabu.
Nothing real, nothing helpful.	Wanti dhugaa hin jiru, wanti gargaaru hin jiru.
He has the worst luck anyone knows	Carraa hamaa namni beeku qaba
I knew it wasn’t going away	Akka hin deemne nan beeka ture
This was a worse place to be.	Kun bakka ta'uu qabu kana caalaa hamaa ture.
But none of us did.	Garuu nu keessaa tokkollee hin goone.
But he's a good man.	Garuu nama gaarii.
But he knew it would be enough.	Garuu akka gahaa ta'u beeka ture.
I want you here with me now	Amma asitti na waliin si barbaada
But I still couldn't see what it was.	Garuu ammallee maal akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye.
It doesn’t help.	Hin gargaaru.
I didn't know	Ani hin beeku ture
I have a big day tomorrow	Boru guyyaa guddaa qaba
She didn't want what she wanted.	Waan barbaaddu malee hin barbaanne.
Maybe now is his chance.	Tarii amma carraa isaa ta'uu danda'a.
These two are different.	Kun lamaan adda adda.
I’m not going to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf hin deemu.
I wouldn't be able to tell.	Silaa himuu hin danda'u ture.
That seems right.	Sun sirrii fakkaata.
Maybe everything would be fine.	Tarii wanti hundi gaarii ta'a ture.
I wanted to ask her how she did it	Akkamitti akka goote ishee gaafachuu barbaade
I couldn't stay here long	Yeroo dheeraa as jiraachuu hin danda'u ture
It was her car.	Konkolaataa ishee ture.
I really don't know	Dhuguma hin beeku
It seemed easy.	Salphaa fakkaata ture.
Even in the night.	Halkan keessa illee.
Otherwise there was no sound.	Yoo kana hin taane sagalee hin turre.
I shouldn’t have even said that.	Silaa akkas jechuu illee hin qabu ture.
I need more of this in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti kana caalaa na barbaachisa
This is going to be my life now.	Kun jireenya koo amma ta'uuf deema.
I couldn’t see anything	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye
Something I haven’t seen before.	Waan kanaan dura hin argine.
This doesn’t have to be the case.	Kun dirqama akkas ta’uu hin qabu.
You can be a real person.	Nama dhugaa ta'uu dandeessa.
If she’s there, I won’t go	Yoo isheen achi jirtu hin deemu
I am right inside you	Ani sirriitti keessa kee jira
But I couldn't see him	Ani garuu isa arguu hin dandeenye
Not really sure, it's the right one	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa miti, isa sirrii dha
Now I know exactly what to do	Amma maal akkan godhu sirriitti beeka
He tried again.	Ammas yaale.
He didn’t like it.	Inni hin jaallatu ture.
I was a lot at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baay'een ture.
It’s just a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa.
With these people.	Namoota kana waliin.
I didn't know you had so much in you.	Waan baay'ee akka si keessa qabdu hin beeku ture.
But we don’t have that.	Garuu nuti sana hin qabnu.
Except for being a teacher.	Barsiisaa ta'uu malee.
I had to do the right thing	Waan sirrii taʼe gochuun qaba ture
Who knows nothing.	Kan homaa hin beekne.
Except that it wasn’t.	Akka hin turre malee.
But this is wrong.	Garuu kun dogoggora.
Now that can only be good!.	Amma sun gaarii qofa ta'uu danda'a!.
It was very important to us.	Nuuf baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
That wasn’t his job.	Sun hojii isaa hin turre.
I recognize that voice.	Sagalee sana nan beeka.
She didn't know.	Hin beektu turte.
I knew nothing about that	Waa'ee sanaa homaa hin beeku ture
I think it’s very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola jedheen yaada.
I want everything, you know? 	Ani waan hundumaa barbaada, beektaa?
I couldn't believe myself	Of amanuu hin dandeenye
he says.	jedha.
I know something is wrong	Waan tokko akka dogoggora ta'e nan beeka
It bought me some time.	Yeroo muraasa naaf bite.
I can't say one bad thing about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan hamaa tokko dubbachuu hin danda'u.
It was very clear.	Baayyee ifa ture.
They weren’t going to do that.	Isaan akkas gochuuf hin turre.
It came out of you.	Si keessaa ba'e.
I really enjoyed this one	Isa kana baay'een itti gammade
Seeing the reality.	Dhugaa jiru arguu.
I didn’t know what to do	Waan godhu hin beeku ture
He wants more than anything right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waan hunda caalaa barbaada
That's not usually the case.	Yeroo baay'ee akkas miti.
I have one of them.	Ani tokko qaba.
No hesitation whatsoever.	Duubatti deebi'uu tokkollee hin qabu.
But I have a lot in me	Ani garuu waan baay'ee of keessaa qaba
They had to go now.	Amma deemuu qabu turan.
Not that there was much.	Baay'ee ture jechuu miti.
That’s what it was.	Kanuma ture.
One of his names.	Maqaa isaa keessaa tokko.
I think that was a huge mistake.	Sun dogoggora guddaa ture jedheen yaada.
They were so big and very bright.	Isaan akkas guddaa fi baayyee ifa turan.
That, of course, was pretty bad.	Sun, beekamaadha, baay’ee hamaa ture.
But this was a sure thing.	Garuu kun waan mirkanaa’aa ture.
I will do that for you	Ani akkas siif nan godha
But it looks bad.	Garuu hamaa fakkaata.
I think that’s obvious.	Sun ifa natti fakkaata.
I think he knows that.	Kana waan beeku natti fakkaata.
A year is a long time	Waggaa tokko yeroo dheeraa dha
I have to go this way.	Karaa kanaan deemuun qaba.
He just had to say.	Jechuun qofa qaba ture.
But there was nothing in it.	Garuu wanti keessa hin turre.
I can't tell you his name	Maqaa isaa siif jechuu hin danda'u
But we have a problem.	Garuu rakkoo qabna.
I couldn’t eat any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee nyaachuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t know you could do that	Akkas gochuu akka dandeessu hin beeku ture
He never knew it.	Inni gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
There can never be another.	Kan biraa gonkumaa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
In my eyes.	Ija koo keessatti.
Maybe he's good.	Tarii inni gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
You are exactly right.	Ati sirriitti sirrii dha.
I don't think there is.	Kan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
That's what happens.	Kan ta'u kanuma.
They never did.	Isaan gonkumaa hin goone.
I thought it went well	Akka gaariitti deeme natti fakkaate
I wonder where they all are today	Har'a hundi isaanii eessa jiru jedheen yaada
I can make you anything you want to be.	Waan ta'uu barbaaddu hunda si gochuu nan danda'a.
The more he gave, the better he got.	Hamma kenne gaarii argate.
I hadn't really thought about it	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa hin yaadne ture
No one knows him.	Namni isa beeku hin jiru.
Should do it every other day	Guyyaa lama lama gochuu qaba
It's never going to happen.	Gonkumaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
Maybe she was.	Tarii isheen turte ta'a.
He doesn’t do any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin godhu.
You know he loves me.	Akka na jaallatu ni beekta.
He knew them both very well.	Isaan lamaan baayyee sirriitti beeka ture.
It worked very well for me.	Baayyee naaf hojjete.
I don't know her name.	Maqaa ishee hin beeku.
But that doesn't mean anything will happen.	Garuu wanti tokko ni ta'a jechuu miti.
I think we didn’t need anything	Homaa nu hin barbaachifne jedheen yaada
If he ever does.	Yoom iyyuu yoo godhe.
I can't believe it happened.	Ta'e jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
Which she does.	Kan isheen gootu.
He already knew the answer.	Deebii isaa duruu beeka ture.
They were nothing.	Isaan homaa hin turre.
I am definitely not alone.	Ani kophaa koo akkan hin taane beekamaadha.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
But there is a problem here.	Garuu asitti rakkoon jira.
It would have never happened.	Silaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
I was alone for a long time	Anis yeroo dheeraaf kophaa koo ture
What can never happen must happen.	Wanti gonkumaa ta’uu hin dandeenye ta’uu qaba.
She was no different.	Isheen adda hin turre.
I thought it was a good year.	Bara gaarii natti fakkaate.
You should not make this mistake.	Dogoggora kana gochuu hin qabdu.
I was sure she would	Akka gootu mirkanaa'aa ture
He is more important than that.	Inni kana caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
But then again, it could happen.	Garuu sana booda ammas, ta'uu danda'a.
Two are different.	Lama adda adda.
But not now.	Garuu amma miti.
I didn't want to say anything to him	Ani homaa itti dubbachuu hin barbaanne
It doesn’t work though.	Hin hojjetu garuu.
But wait!' he asked. 	Garuu eegaa!’ jedhee gaafate.
I mean, you should have seen some of his stuff	Silaa waan isaa tokko tokko arguu qabda ture jechuu kooti
No one could.	Namni tokkollee hin dandeenye.
I hope it works that way	Akkasitti akka hojjetu abdiin qaba
But you weren’t there.	Garuu ati achi hin turre.
The girl you couldn’t recognize.	Intala ati beekuu hin dandeenye.
It could have been a lot worse though.	Silaa garuu baayyee hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
We were just kids, really.	Ijoollee qofa turre, dhuguma.
I just can't get it right	Ani garuu sirriitti argachuu hin danda'u qofa
Like everyone else does.	Akkuma namni hundi godhu.
I am just one person	Ani nama tokko qofa
I don't have much time	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabu
I didn't want to be lucky.	Carraa ta'uu hin barbaanne.
It has its own life.	Jireenya isaa qaba.
They are still there.	Ammas jiru.
So we need to know.	Kanaaf beekuu qabna.
Small problem here	Rakkoo xiqqoo asitti
I thought that was a really good one	Sun dhuguma isa gaarii natti fakkaate
Sometimes they do.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjetu.
In the present case, however.	Dhimma amma jiru keessatti garuu.
To be yourself.	Of ta'uuf.
I don't know what's right	Maaltu sirrii akka ta'e hin beeku
But there is something you need to see.	Garuu wanti ati arguu qabdu jira.
I thought you were my mother	Ati haadha koo natti fakkaate
He already knew he wouldn’t	Akka hin goone duruu beeka ture
I knew nothing about them	Waa'ee isaanii homaa hin beeku ture
They can be a lot of work.	Hojii baay’ee ta’uu danda’u.
I knew it would never happen	Yoomiyyuu akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I wouldn’t tell him anything, but he didn’t have anything	Ani homaa itti hin himu ture, garuu homaa hin qabu ture
A little bit about me	Xiqqoo waa'ee koo
That's all.	Kanuma qofa.
You don’t make it easy.	Salphaa hin gootu.
Maybe he didn't.	Tarii hin goone ta'a.
If you don't see about.	Yoo hin argine waa'ee.
He should have eaten less	Silaa waan xiqqoo nyaachuu qaba ture
We were the only ones watching.	Kan ilaalaa turre nu qofa ture.
I don’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beeku.
I wondered what he wanted	Maal barbaada jedheen yaade
Which makes it all so much worse.	Wanti hunda isaa baayyee caalaa hamaa isa godhu.
That works fine so far.	Sun hanga ammaatti gaarii hojjeta.
I haven’t seen them in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan hin argine
I thought he did a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjete natti fakkaate.
I think about this, from time to time	Kana nan yaada, yeroo yeroon
I only ever wanted you	Ani yoomiyyuu si qofa barbaade
Never more so than this.	Gonkumaa kana caalaa hin taane.
He has a life here now	Amma asitti jireenya qaba
She did, but he didn’t.	Isheen akkas goote, inni garuu hin goone.
They need your help.	Gargaarsa keessan isaan barbaachisa.
But not my parents.	Garuu warra koo miti.
I'm definitely doing my best.	Ani waanan danda'u hunda gochaa akkan jiru beekamaadha.
But they will be together.	Garuu waliin ta'u.
Better not talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu dhiisuu wayya.
I have no idea how he knows about it.	Akkamitti akka inni waa'ee kanaa beeku yaada hin qabu.
They want your vote.	Sagalee keessan barbaadu.
I could do a good job here	Asitti hojii gaarii hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture
There was nothing he could know.	Wanti inni beekuu danda'u hin turre.
Time, as in, time.	Yeroon, akkuma keessa, yeroo.
Everything else was there.	Wanti biraa hundi achi ture.
He didn't do anything to her.	Homaa ishee hin goone.
He is looking for the truth	Dhugaa barbaadaa jira
That it's nothing.	Homaa akka hin taane.
It seemed important.	Waan barbaachisaa fakkaata ture.
I think you care about me	Ati naaf yaaddu natti fakkaata
You may not need to do anything.	Homaa gochuun si hin barbaachisu taʼa.
He can't be here.	Inni as ta'uu hin danda'u.
He didn't do anything good	Waan gaarii hin hojjenne
This was for a while	Kun yeroo muraasaaf ture
I think you’ll love it	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
I don't understand much	Waan baay'ee naaf hin galle
Sound, of course.	Sagalee, beekamaadha.
I want her to look like her	Isheen akka ishee fakkaattu nan barbaada
We stayed in this one place longer than usual.	Bakka tokko kana keessa yeroo biraa caalaa yeroo dheeraa turre.
I’m not quite the same	Ani guutummaatti akkasitti wal hin fakkaatu
I'm pretty good at that	Ani sun baayyee gaarii dha
It wasn’t me.	Ana hin turre.
It was in my new room	Kutaa koo isa haaraa keessa ture
Repeat this a few times.	Kana yeroo muraasa irra deebi'i.
A little different.	Xiqqoo adda.
I wanted to go again, but I couldn’t	Ammas deemuu barbaade, garuu hin dandeenye
I don’t think this is one.	Kun tokko natti hin fakkaatu.
It's all possible right here.	Hundi isaa sirriitti asitti ni danda'ama.
It is very new.	Baayyee haaraa dha.
But there is nothing there.	Garuu achitti wanti tokkollee hin jiru.
He shouldn’t have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture
He bought me a little car, even.	Konkolaataa xiqqoo naaf bite, illee.
It’s our time.	Yeroon keenya.
I’m just a part of it.	Ani kutaa isaa qofa.
New to us.	Haaraa nuuf.
It was so obvious.	Akkas ifa ture.
I wonder why he is doing this	Maaliif akkas gochaa jira jedheen yaada
I mean, it can be funny	Qoosaa ta'uu danda'a jechuu kooti
He’s like me.	Inni akka kooti.
I can believe a lot of what he says	Waan inni jedhu baay'een amanuu danda'a
But three things occurred to me.	Garuu wanti sadii natti dhufe.
There is no answer.	Deebii hin qabu.
I could stay here with you	Asitti si waliin turuu nan danda'a ture
All seemed clear.	Hundi ifa fakkaata ture.
You don’t understand one bit.	Xiqqoo tokkollee siif hin galle.
He didn't forgive anything.	Homaa dhiifama hin goone.
Something much bigger than me.	Waan na caalaa baayyee guddaa ta'e.
That is absolutely not true.	Sun gonkumaa dhugaa miti.
Probably a bit extreme.	Xiqqoo garmalee ta'uu hin oolu.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
She was a good people.	Namoota gaarii turte.
I know what happened.	Waan ta'e nan beeka.
I think you’ll love it	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
I know you want to talk.	Dubbachuu akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
I have no interest.	Fedhii tokkollee hin qabu.
Two parents, two children.	Warra lama, ijoollee lama.
I can't tell you any more	Kana caalaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
This man has many names.	Namni kun maqaa hedduu qaba.
I like that in a guy	Gurbaa tokko keessatti akkas natti tola
A fact she knows all too well	Dhugaa isheen sirriitti beektu
I don’t like them anymore.	Kana booda isaan hin jaalladhu.
I've always loved it	Yeroo hundumaa baay'een jaalladha
He was obviously expecting this.	Kana eegaa akka ture ifaadha.
I have a feeling it won’t.	Akka hin taane miira qaba.
You have to ask them about it.	Waa'ee isaa isaan gaafachuu qabda.
There wasn’t one.	Tokkollee hin turre.
That, however, is not the question before us.	Sun garuu gaaffii nu dura jiru miti.
But she was here.	Isheen garuu as turte.
It doesn't have to be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu hin qabu.
We just haven’t made a big deal out of it.	Nuti waan guddaa irraa hin hojjenne qofa.
He just might do it.	Inni qofa gochuu danda'a.
I love cats and dogs	Saree fi saree nan jaalladha
That would be a problem.	Sun rakkoo ta'a.
I still can't believe you did that, out here	Ammallee akkas akka goote amanuu hin danda'u, as ala
I thought you knew me	Na beektu natti fakkaate
I knew she didn’t need to sleep like that	Akkasitti hirriba akka ishee hin barbaachifne nan beeka ture
You have a job.	Hojii tokko qabda.
I do that often.	Yeroo baayyee akkas nan godha.
No one else got involved.	Namni biraa harka keessa hin galle.
Nothing much in common there.	Achitti waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu hin jiru.
If only he were his father.	Osoo abbaa isaa ta'ee.
It may still be ancient times.	Ammas bara durii ta'uu danda'a.
I wonder what happened	Maaltu ta'e jedheen yaada
You are not alone.	Ati si qofa miti.
I am going with him	Anis isa waliin deemaa jira
I never know, really	Ani gonkumaa hin beeku, dhuguma
They know Him.	Isa beeku.
But he didn't go	Garuu hin deemne
He may not have gone that long	Yeroo dheeraa sana hin deemne taʼa
A little too much sometimes	Xiqqoo garmalee yeroo tokko tokko
I didn’t see them in people.	Namoota keessa isaan hin argine.
A very long time ago.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa dura.
They could have helped me, but they never could.	Silaa na gargaaruu dandaʼu turan, garuu gonkumaa na gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I know his voice	Sagalee isaa nan beeka
On the situation.	Haala jiru irratti.
I know you do	Akka ati gootu nan beeka
I have to do that.	Ani akkas gochuu qaba.
He didn’t quite look like mine.	Inni guutummaatti kan koo hin fakkaatu ture.
I want to know who did this	Eenyu akka kana godhe beekuu barbaada
I want him in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti isa barbaada
You're doing fine without me.	Ana malee gaarii ta'aa jirta.
But that wasn’t the problem.	Garuu rakkoon sun kanuma hin turre.
It was their only hope.	Abdii isaanii qofa ture.
No one was coming for me.	Namni naaf dhufu hin turre.
That seems to be everything.	Sun waan hundumaa fakkaata.
It's not the same thing.	Waan tokko miti.
I couldn’t help it, I didn’t want to help it	Ani gargaaruu hin dandeenye, gargaaruu hin barbaanne
But then no more.	Sana booda garuu kana caalaa hin jiru.
I knew what he meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaade nan beeka ture
I knew you needed that	Sana akka si barbaachisu nan beeka ture
I like it a lot more now	Amma baay'ee natti tola
Just like she did.	Akkuma isheen goote.
It wasn’t that easy for me.	Akkas naaf salphaa hin turre.
I know it’s not true.	Dhugaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
I mean, of course.	Jechuun koo beekamaadha.
He was here.	Inni as ture.
When we can do this, we should do so.	Yeroo kana gochuu dandeenyu akkas gochuu qabna.
Unless you are making one now.	Amma tokko hojjechaa jirta yoo ta'e malee.
I’m not in your way	Ani karaa kee hin jiru
We wanted to be more authentic	Kana caalaa dhugaa ta'uu barbaanne
I have been waiting.	Ani eegaa tureera.
He didn’t want her to know the whole truth	Dhugaa guutuu akka isheen beektu hin barbaanne
What he was doing then was good.	Wanti inni yeroo sana hojjechaa ture gaarii ture.
Everything seemed fine after that.	Sana booda wanti hundi sirriitti fakkaata ture.
Now you have to stay in one place for a while.	Amma yeroo muraasaaf bakka tokko turuu qabdu.
I think you should be	Ta'uu qabda jedheen yaada
I can't believe this	Kana amanuu hin danda'u
I hesitated for a moment	Yeroo muraasaaf duubatti jedheen
I did everything I could against her	Ani waanan danda'u hunda ishee irratti godhe
Something he wasn’t into.	Waan inni keessa hin turre.
So they were here for a while	Kanaaf yeroo muraasaaf as turan
I didn't talk to her today	Har'a ishee waliin hin dubbanne
I didn't think so.	Akkasitti hin yaadne.
He was out there when everything went wrong	Yeroo wanti hundi itti deemu achi ala ture
I think it will be good	Gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
We need to know exactly where.	Eessa akka ta'e sirriitti beekuu qabna.
It still doesn't work.	Ammas hin hojjetu.
You have to speak for him.	Isaaf dubbachuu qabda.
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
There isn’t one.	Tokko hin jiru.
I want you to be there.	Akka ati achi jirtu nan barbaada.
I just wanted to tell you my feelings.	Miira koo qofa sitti himuu barbaade.
He really should get an hour	Dhuguma sa'aatii argachuu qaba
They have three children	Ijoollee sadii qabu
He may even see him again.	Ammas isa arguu illee dandaʼa.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
I can't eat this.	Kana nyaachuu hin danda'u.
Not really sure what happened this time.	Dhuguma yeroo kana maaltu akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
I think it’s dangerous, maybe even dangerous.	Balaa qaba, tarii balaa illee qaba jedheen yaada.
I’ve been working on this all day	Guyyaa guutuu kana irratti hojjechaa ture
This is one question, not two.	Kun gaaffii tokko malee lama miti.
He still couldn’t speak	Ammallee dubbachuu hin dandeenye
Always my full name.	Yeroo hundumaa maqaa koo guutuu.
I can't see our work	Hojii keenya arguu hin danda'u
For a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf.
It wouldn't have seemed like it.	Silaa waan hin fakkaatu ture.
This is like.	Kun akka.
I don't want to do this.	Ani kana gochuu hin barbaadu.
I wish things were different	Osoo wanti adda ta'ee natti tola
We have a hat.	Kophee qabna.
Except in times like the present.	Yeroo akka ammaa malee.
I have the same problem.	Anis rakkoo wal fakkaatu qaba.
This is definitely not the same.	Kun tokko akka hin taane beekamaadha.
They could be much more than that.	Isaan kana caalaa baay’ee ta’uu danda’u.
I can't believe he's gone	Inni akka hin jirre amanuu hin danda'u
That’s the job, really.	Hojiin sun kanuma, dhuguma.
I couldn’t leave this little guy alone	Gurbaa xiqqoo kana kophaa dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t even know myself	Of illee hin beeku ture
It just did the job.	Hojii sana qofa hojjete.
It could have been a disaster.	Silaa balaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
He wanted to know if he was leaving tomorrow	Boru akka deemu beekuu barbaade
I can't tell you how	Akkamitti akka ta'e sitti himuu hin danda'u
But he was a man.	Inni garuu nama ture.
I saw it there.	Achitti arge.
When she thought of nothing else.	Yeroo isheen waan biraa hin yaadne.
She's a little obvious.	Isheen waan xiqqoo ifaadha.
I wouldn’t be here at all	Silaa tasumaa as hin jiru ture
I didn’t think about it at all	Ani tasumaa itti hin yaadne
You couldn't have known what was happening.	Silaa waan ta'aa jiru beekuu hin dandeessu turte.
He got that absolutely right	Sana guutummaatti sirriitti argate
I couldn't believe that was all	Kana qofa akka ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
I can give you one other name	Maqaa biraa tokko siif kennuu nan danda'a
That was her big mistake.	Dogoggora ishee guddaa sun ture.
He already knew the truth of what happened that day	Dhugaa wanta guyyaa sana taʼe duruu beeka ture
I wonder how that will happen.	Sun akkamitti ta'a jedheen yaada.
I came here to be with you	Si waliin ta'uuf as dhufe
I can't do more .	Kana caalaa gochuu hin danda'u .
You really don’t need it.	Dhuguma si hin barbaachisu.
It could have been both.	Silaa lamaan isaanii ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t know what to do	Waan godhu hin beeku ture
It didn’t matter where he was.	Bakka inni jiru homaa hin turre.
Again, something is clearly not right.	Ammas wanti tokko sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
Something seems to be happening, but it's not clear what.	Waan tokko waan ta'u fakkaata, garuu maal akka ta'e ifa miti.
They are right to do so.	Isaan kana gochuun isaanii sirrii dha.
I hope things are different now	Amma wanti jiru adda akka ta'u abdiin qaba
These are different.	Isaan kun adda.
I thought maybe you had	Tarii qabda jedheen yaade
I saw her way.	Karaa ishee arge.
Then he looked at the clock.	Sana booda sa'aatii ilaale.
He seemed like a nice guy.	Inni nama gaarii fakkaata ture.
I don't have time to tell him about it	Waa'ee isaa yeroo itti himu hin qabu
We don’t have to go anywhere.	Bakka tokko deemuu hin qabnu.
She was great.	Isheen guddaa turte.
They were in danger.	Balaa keessa turan.
I don't mean to yell at you today	Har'a sitti iyyuu jechuu koo miti
It really, really does exist.	Dhuguma, dhuguma ni jira.
We have money in that.	Sana keessa maallaqa qabna.
This will indeed happen	Kun dhuguma ni ta'a
He didn't seem to care.	Inni waan dhimma itti ba'e hin fakkaatu.
I thought it was too much	Garmalee natti fakkaate
Soon they were outside on the street.	Yeroo muraasa booda ala karaa irra turan.
I had no such idea	Yaada akkasii hin qabu ture
I mean, it just lives the other way.	Karaa biraa qofa jiraata jechuu kooti.
That’s how I think of her	Akkasitti ishee yaada
Two in the morning, three in the afternoon.	Ganama lama, waaree booda sadii.
I didn’t want to see anyone	Nama tokkollee arguu hin barbaanne
I didn’t think that was true	Sun dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
That’s the obvious reason.	Sababni ifa ta’e kanuma.
If anything like that ever happens.	Yoom iyyuu wanti akkasii yoo ta'e.
He says only three months.	Ji'a sadii qofa jedha.
He had no clothes.	Uffata hin qabu ture.
Please tell me the truth.	Mee dhugaa jiru natti himi.
I just didn’t know what to say	Waan jedhu qofa hin beeku ture
He thought it looked good.	Gaarii fakkaata jedhee yaade.
But most of the time it's still pretty big.	Garuu yeroo baayyee ammallee baayyee guddaa dha.
He was so good.	Inni akka malee gaarii ture.
It is not a complete hope.	Abdii guutuu miti.
He knows the joke.	Qoosaa ni beeka.
Perhaps this is true.	Tarii kun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
Sometimes I think about them	Yeroo tokko tokko waa'ee isaanii nan yaada
Not exactly	Sirriitti miti .
It was the right issue	Dhimma sirrii ture
I couldn't tell	Ani beekuu hin dandeenye
She doesn’t do it.	Isheen hin gootu.
Not these children of the house.	Ijoollee manaa kana miti.
Such as.	Kan akka.
I haven’t said anything to him, yet	Ani homaa itti hin dubbanne, hanga ammaatti
I mean nothing, of course	Homaa jechuu koo miti, beekamaadha
It just wasn’t that kind of thing.	Wanti akkasii qofa hin turre.
I didn't do it yesterday before.	Kana dura kaleessa hin goone.
I was a schoolteacher	Ani barsiisaa mana barumsaa ture
Not up to you.	Hanga sitti miti.
I want to do this right.	Kana sirriitti gochuu barbaada.
I thought about luck	Waa'ee carraa jedheen yaade
I was just so excited	Ani akka malee gammade qofa ture
I love what he does	Waan inni hojjetu baay'een jaalladha
I didn’t want to live without her	Ishee malee jiraachuu hin barbaanne
It’s not just about money.	Maallaqa qofa miti.
You’re better than me.	Ana caalaa si wayya.
But there isn’t.	Garuu hin jiru.
I don't want to, I couldn't go back	Ani hin barbaadu, duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
They still exist.	Ammas ni jiru.
Nothing special.	Wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
Many of us are there.	Baay'een keenya achi jirra.
But she’s not just bad.	Garuu isheen hamaa qofa miti.
I shouldn't have come back here	Silaa as deebi'uu hin qabu ture
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
I wasn’t like any of them	Ani akka isaan keessaa tokkollee hin turre
But maybe it's true.	Garuu tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
He thought it was right.	Sirrii itti fakkaate.
This is not the reality.	Kun dhugaa jiru miti.
It’s just, you were there.	Inni qofa, ati achi turte.
We have two.	Lama qabna.
I was on the full car	Ani konkolaataa guutuu irra ture
We agreed not to go there.	Achi akka hin deemne walii galle.
I didn’t know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku ture.
I am in exactly the same situation	Anis sirriitti haala wal fakkaatu keessa jira
But she didn’t have it.	Garuu hin qabdu turte.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
Maybe you can really help me.	Tarii dhuguma na gargaaruu dandeessa taʼa.
You may not want to be, but you are.	Taʼuu hin barbaaddu taʼa, garuu ni jirta.
You were someone else.	Ati nama biraa turte.
This would not happen here.	Kun asitti hin ta'u ture.
I think you might recognize her	Tarii ishee beekuu dandeessu jedheen yaada
I would never have done that.	Silaa gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
I could usually go with them	Yeroo baayyee isaan waliin deemuu nan danda'a ture
Three long years.	Waggaa dheeraa sadii.
I want us to do that.	Akkas akka goonu nan barbaada.
I thought you would like that idea	Yaada sana ni jaallattu jedheen yaade
I didn't see her much after that	Sana booda baay'ee ishee hin argine
Good, he thought it should be.	Gaarii, akkas ta'uu qaba jedhee yaade.
He really wanted to talk.	Dubbachuu baay'ee barbaade.
Seems like the right way.	Karaa sirrii fakkaata.
He is here almost every day	Guyyaa hunda jechuun ni danda'ama as jira
I didn't know who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
It's better not to be.	Ta'uu dhiisuu wayya.
We have to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabna.
It’s just his dog.	Saree isaa qofa.
My wife on my arm and all.	Haadha manaa koo harka koo irra fi hunda.
He said he was sorry after another time.	Yeroo biraa booda dhiifama jedhe.
I'm not, it can't be.	Ani miti, ta'uu hin danda'u.
They are more than obligatory.	Isaan dirqama caalaa.
How to tell you.	Akkamitti akka sitti himu.
It was all real.	Hundi isaa dhugaa ture.
But she’s right.	Garuu isheen sirrii dha.
I don't know much more,' he said.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee hin beeku,' jedhe.
He needs to know what she wants	Waan isheen barbaaddu beekuu qaba
He went both ways.	Karaa lamaan deeme.
He has the money.	Maallaqa qaba.
I don’t have a picture this time.	Yeroo kana suuraa hin qabu.
I know a lot that can help you	Waan si gargaaruu danda'u baay'een beeka
Not really sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e dhuguma mirkanaa'aa miti.
I didn’t mean anything	Homaa jechuu koo hin turre
I didn’t speak my voice.	Sagalee koo hin dubbanne.
I could live with that	Sana waliin jiraachuu nan danda'a ture
I can't say I'm sorry enough	Dhiifama gahaa jechuu hin danda'u
It’s you, not me.	Ati malee ana miti.
I knew no one was there.	Namni tokkollee akka hin jirre nan beeka ture.
I know what you need.	Waan si barbaachisu nan beeka.
I mean, look at those eyes	Ija sana ilaalaa jechuu kooti
I hope there is none of this	Kana keessaa homaa akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
Old, but nice.	Durii, garuu namatti tola.
I was no longer looking in from the outside	Kana booda ala keessa ilaalaa hin turre
I’m working on that, you know.	Sana irratti hojjechaa jira, beekta.
It’s my way.	Karaa kooti.
We are together.	Waliin jirra.
I knew it wouldn’t be an easy one	Kan salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I still don’t know what to make of it.	Ammallee maal akka irraa godhu hin beeku.
I don't have to do it for you	Siif gochuu hin qabu
It was that kind of week.	Torban akkasii ture.
That would be a bad time for him.	Yeroon sun isaaf yeroo hamaa ta'a.
A couple of weeks will be enough	Torban lama tokko gahaa ta'a
This is important.	Kun barbaachisaa dha.
I don't know what that is.	Sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
I thought it would be different	Ani garuu adda ta'a jedheen yaade
I know you want answers.	Deebii akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
She didn’t understand why she did what she did	Waan goote maaliif akka goote hin hubanne
I really hope it is	Dhuguma akka ta'e abdiin qaba
I’m not the only one who thinks that	Ani qofa miti kan akkas yaadu
She had three children with him.	Ijoollee sadii isa waliin qabdi turte.
The one that's great.	Kan guddaa ta'e.
He doesn’t seem to notice.	Inni waan hubate hin fakkaatu.
I think there’s something in us.	Waan nu keessa jira jedheen yaada.
I can't believe it	Ani amanuu hin danda'u
I just couldn’t stay home, you know	Mana turuu qofa hin dandeenye, beekta
A little different this time.	Yeroo kana xiqqoo adda.
I know this is yours	Kun kan kee ta'uu nan beeka
I didn’t really want to be here	Ani dhuguma as jiraachuu hin barbaanne
This isn’t a big deal.	Kun waan guddaa miti.
I don't think it's his idea.	Yaada isaa natti hin fakkaatu.
I went out with him.	Anis isa waliin ba'e.
He had other ideas.	Yaada biraa qaba ture.
We didn’t know what to do.	Maal gochuu akka qabnu hin beekne.
You are not too tall.	Ati garmalee dheeraa miti.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Ani qofa amanuu hin barbaanne
You're the same.	Ati kanuma.
I wasn’t really that good at the time.	Ani yeroo sanatti dhuguma akkas gaarii hin turre.
This is going to be motherhood and wifehood.	Kun haadha ta'uu fi haadha manaa ta'uuf deema.
I have to do this	Kana gochuun qaba
I know exactly where he is	Bakka inni jiru sirriitti beeka
I'm usually not like that	Ani yeroo baayyee akkas miti
If he wanted her.	Osoo ishee barbaade.
I already knew where I was going	Eessa akkan deemu duruu beeka ture
But there isn't much.	Garuu baay'ee hin jiru.
There’s nothing you can do about that.	Sana irratti wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
It was just one thing.	Waan tokko qofa ture.
He knew better than she did.	Inni ishee caalaa beeka ture.
I haven’t had one yet.	Hanga ammaatti tokkollee hin qabu.
I never want to do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin barbaadu.
That’s how it was.	Akkas turee.
He certainly does.	Akka godhu beekamaadha.
I just didn’t know what to say	Waan jedhu qofa hin beeku ture
It’s not even our business.	Dhimma keenya illee miti.
I can't really even have that much here	Dhuguma hanga sanatti asitti illee qabaachuu hin danda'u
She was not one of them.	Isheen isaan keessaa tokko hin turre.
He had one good year.	Waggaa gaarii tokko qaba ture.
I love you so, so, so much	Akkas, akkas, baay'een si jaalladha
Now, wait, this could work.	Amma, eegaa, kun hojjechuu danda'a.
I want her to know.	Akka isheen beektu nan barbaada.
He was in a terrible state.	Haala hamaa keessa ture.
I had never been to this place before	Kanaan dura bakka kana hin deemne ture
I wonder what they’re all doing tonight	Hundi isaanii halkan kana maal hojjechaa jiru jedheen yaada
He wants to go.	Inni deemuu barbaada.
I want it not to happen.	Ani akka hin taane barbaada.
I have no idea why this is	Kun maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
Right in my hands.	Sirriitti harka koo keessa.
It’s not life.	Jireenya miti.
He’s really good at it.	Dhuguma itti gaarii dha.
It was everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee wanti hundi ture.
You can join me in it.	Itti na waliin ta'uu dandeessu.
I would never say anything like that.	Ani gonkumaa waan akkasii hin jedhu ture.
Which, in this case, you don’t.	Kan, haala kana keessatti, ati hin goone.
I can't tell you why right now	Yeroo ammaa kana maaliif akka ta'e sitti himuu hin danda'u
I will never be her.	Ani yoomiyyuu ishee hin ta'u.
He knew it was going to be a long day.	Guyyaa dheeraa ta'uuf akka jiru ni beeka ture.
No one can see her.	Namni ishee arguu hin danda'u.
Which they may not be.	Kan isaan hin taane ta’uu danda’u.
I really think you should go now	Dhuguma amma deemuu qabda jedheen yaada
I didn’t know this existed	Kun akka jiru hin beeku ture
Probably everything you know.	Tarii waan ati beektu hunda ta'uu hin oolu.
I can't say much more than that	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu hin danda'u
I mean really, really	Dhuguma, dhuguma jechuu kooti
Take a look at that.	Mee sana ilaalaa.
I haven’t seen them in a week	Torban tokko booda isaan hin argine
That’s one thing.	Wanti tokko kanuma.
Everything was going smoothly.	Wanti hundi sirriitti deemaa ture.
I didn't think about it	Ani itti hin yaadne
I was just a human being.	Ani nama qofa ture.
It was a good episode.	Kutaa gaarii ture.
Everyone knew that.	Namni hundi sana beeka ture.
Now I think they were drinking.	Amma dhugaa turan jedheen yaada.
She had pictures, she had everything.	Suuraa qabdi turte, waan hunda qabdi turte.
I want to get back to the guy	Gurbaa sanatti deebi'uu barbaada
I know where we were.	Bakka turre nan beeka.
They may be right.	Isaan sirrii taʼuu dandaʼu.
I told him we were too	Anis nuti illee ta'uu keenya itti hime
I think it says all of that	Kana hunda kan jedhu natti fakkaata
I didn’t say any of that though	Ani garuu sana keessaa tokkollee hin dubbanne
That was a disaster.	Sun balaa ture.
There was no answer though.	Deebii tokkollee hin turre garuu.
I didn’t want to be here	Ani as jiraachuu hin barbaanne
Clearly, it is not.	Akka hin taane ifaadha.
I am not some people.	Ani namoota tokko tokko miti.
I didn't know what it was	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I didn’t do any of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
That’s not a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii miti.
There was still plenty of time.	Ammas yeroon baay'ee ture.
But it really wasn’t like that.	Garuu dhuguma akkas hin turre.
I had high hopes for you	Abdii guddaa siif qaba ture
It’s just what she thinks.	Waan isheen yaaddu qofa.
You just know something is out there, but you don't know what it is.	Waan tokko akka ala jiru qofa beekta, garuu maal akka ta'e hin beektu.
That’s all I was expecting.	Kana qofa eegaa ture.
I probably won’t see you for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf si arguu hin oolu
He had a few friends there	Hiriyyoota muraasa achitti qaba ture
I haven’t done that for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas hin goone
Why did it take this long?.	Maaliif yeroo dheeraa kana fudhate?.
I still want to be that guy.	Ammallee gurbaa sana ta'uu barbaada.
I want every piece of you	Ani kutaa keessan hunda nan barbaada
Like, you just have it.	Akka, ati qofa qabda.
I was there two years ago	Waggaa lama dura achi ture
It came this way.	Karaa kanaan dhufe.
I wasn't sure who could ask.	Eenyu gaafachuu akka danda'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It’s not giving anything away.	Homaa kennuu miti.
I don't mean that	Akkas jechuu koo miti
I wasn’t there.	Ani hin turre.
I just can't say enough about this place	Waa'ee bakka kanaa gahaa jechuu qofa hin danda'u
They are very interested.	Baayyee fedhii qabu.
I can get another one	Kan biraa argachuu nan danda'a
You can be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu dandeessa.
He wondered what would happen.	Maaltu ta'a jedhee yaade.
He's a good teacher, you know.	Barsiisaa gaarii dha beekta.
No one could say.	Namni jechuu hin dandeenye.
Now it’s better.	Amma wayya.
It's a terrible thing.	Waan hamaa.
I didn't want to believe this could be true	Kun dhugaa ta'uu danda'a jedhee amanuu hin barbaanne
Here this week, there that week.	Torban kana asitti, torban sana achitti.
She’s always been like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas turte.
This is our opportunity, you know.	Kun carraa keenya, beekta.
We need to do this.	Kana gochuu qabna.
He wasn’t a father.	Abbaa hin turre.
I mean a lot.	Baay'ee jechuu kooti.
He knew exactly who he was	Eenyu akka ta'e sirriitti beeka ture
I don't know that you have it.	Akka qabdu hin beeku.
Of course, no one else tried anything like that that day.	Guyyaa sana namni biraa waan akkasii yaale akka hin jirre beekamaadha.
I looked around the bar	Anis naannoo mana dhugaatii sanaa ilaale
I will do it now.	Ani amma nan godha.
I hope that's nothing.	Sun homaa akka ta'e abdiin qaba.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Dogoggora hin turre.
It works well together.	Akka gaariitti waliin hojjeta.
They can still do it but not much else.	Ammas hojjechuu danda'u garuu waan biraa baay'ee miti.
They are not that.	Isaan sun miti.
He could never do that to her.	Inni gonkumaa akkas ishee gochuu hin dandeenye.
He knew the area well	Naannoo sana sirriitti beeka ture
I need help from you both	Gargaarsa isin lamaan irraa barbaada
Great dog, lots of names.	Saree guddaa, maqaa baay'ee.
I should never have gone	Silaa gonkumaa deemuu hin qabu ture
It's just for you.	Siif qofa kan ta'e.
You can only know what is true for you.	Waan siif dhugaa ta'e qofa beekuu dandeessa.
The old is the new.	Kan durii haaraa dha.
How can they make it work.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu gochuu danda’u.
There really is.	Dhuguma jira.
I didn’t realize it took so long	Yeroo dheeraa akka fudhate hin hubanne
But then you know you love her.	Garuu sana booda akka ishee jaallattu beekta.
I didn't know he was out, and coming back	Ani akka inni ba'e, fi deebi'uu isaa hin beeku ture
I think he lives nearby	Inni naannoo sana jiraata natti fakkaata
Like a lot of lots.	Akka baay'ee baay'ee.
This may be timely.	Kun tarii yeroon ta’uu danda’a.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
I can give you his name	Maqaa isaa siif kennuu nan danda'a
I mean, not exactly, of course	Sirriitti miti jechuu kooti, ​​beekamaadha
Opportunity is important.	Carraan barbaachisaa dha.
I wasn't sure of anything anymore	Kana booda homaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Within a week.	Torban tokko keessatti.
Nothing seemed to me.	Wanti tokko natti fakkaate hin jiru.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
He stared at them again.	Ammas ija keessa isaan ilaale.
He was right, man realized.	Inni sirrii akka ture namni hubate.
What it was and what it did.	Maal turee fi maal hojjete.
For him that is not existence.	Isaaf sun jiraachuu miti.
I love working with kids.	Ijoollee wajjin hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
I didn’t tell him that	Ani akkas itti hin himne
I don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabu.
I didn’t want to leave him	Isa dhiisuu hin barbaanne
I can't go any further	Kana caalaa deemuu hin danda'u
I think that was the worst	Sun isa hamaa ture jedheen yaada
You have another question.	Gaaffii biraa qabda.
I can do it.	Hojjechuu nan danda'a.
This is probably true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu hin oolu.
I know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
I didn’t see any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin argine
I was very excited about this work	Hojii kanaaf baay'een gammade
He was looking for himself	Of barbaadaa ture
I always wanted to see this place	Yeroo hundumaa bakka kana arguu nan barbaada ture
He won’t do this for you.	Inni kana siif hin godhu.
I mean, it won't, at all	Hin ta'u jechuu kooti, ​​tasumaa
It would have been more dangerous.	Silaa kana caalaa balaa qaba ture.
I’m not into bad guys	Ani gurbaa hamaa keessa hin beeku
Not a terrible mistake.	Dogoggora hamaa miti.
Would that be an issue?.	Sun dhimma ta'aa?.
I wish I knew them better	Caalaatti osoon isaan beekuu natti tola
Desire not to be so great.	Fedhii akkas guddaa akka hin taane.
I couldn't help but be who.	Eenyu ta'uu dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
She was his mother when he was little.	Haadha isaa yeroo xiqqoo turte.
Certainly things were easier back then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti tokko salphaa akka ture beekamaadha.
This is not good.	Kun gaarii miti.
I really wanted to believe them.	Ani baay'een isaan amanuu barbaade.
Sometimes things happen this way.	Yeroo tokko tokko wanti akkasitti taʼa.
But it must be.	Garuu ta'uu qaba.
I wondered what this one would look like	Inni kun maal fakkaata jedheen yaade
It shouldn’t have gone that way	Silaa akkasitti deemuu hin qabu ture
He is no longer there.	Kana booda hin jiru.
But it wasn't meant to be.	Garuu akkas ta'uuf hin turre.
I couldn’t say more.	Kana caalaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
He didn't even know himself	Of illee hin beekne
I couldn't go back anymore.	Kana booda duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
I wasn’t up there for long	Yeroo dheeraaf achi ol hin turre
But it had to be said.	Garuu jechuun dirqama ture.
He was a good guy, through and through.	Inni gurbaa gaarii ture, karaa fi karaa.
I couldn’t tell you what he did there	Waan achitti hojjete sitti himuu hin dandeenye
He could have told.	Silaa himuu danda'a ture.
He doesn't think about it.	Inni itti hin yaadu.
He can be great.	Inni guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
He is my husband.	Inni abbaa manaa kooti.
I think I should talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu qaba jedheen yaada.
Not sure he can.	Akka danda'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
He even wants children.	Ijoollee illee barbaada.
I knew I had nothing	Ani beeka ture homaa hin qabu ture
Not what he wanted, he knew that much.	Kan inni barbaadu miti, hamma sana beeku ture.
This is just what happened.	Kun waan ta'e qofa.
I never have, not really.	Ani gonkumaa hin qabu, dhuguma miti.
None of this is like me.	Kana keessaa tokkollee akka koo miti.
I can do whatever he can do.	Waan inni gochuu danda'u hunda gochuu nan danda'a.
It would have been a must.	Silaa dirqama ture.
I think we made a mistake	Dogoggora hojjenne natti fakkaata
No one wants them.	Namni isaan barbaadu hin jiru.
He should have helped you	Silaa si gargaaruu qaba ture
They don’t, but they do.	Hin qaban, garuu ni godhu.
I couldn’t do anything else this time	Yeroo kana waan biraa hojjechuuf hin dandeenye
I think it must be something else	Waan biraa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
But it’s not a good idea.	Garuu yaada gaarii miti.
We have to be.	Ta'uu qabna.
I need it so much	Baay'ee na barbaachisa
I don't know what's going to happen.	Maal akka ta'u hin beeku.
I hope no one saw me	Namni na arge akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
He wasn't sure he knew the answer	Deebii isaa akka beeku mirkanaa'aa hin turre
There must be a reason.	Sababni jiraachuu qaba.
He had nothing to say.	Waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
Sometimes I wonder why	Yeroo tokko tokko maaliif jedheen yaada
But it’s not easy anymore.	Garuu kana booda salphaa miti.
I just thought, you know	Ani akkas qofa yaade, beekta
No one did anything.	Namni homaa hin goone.
Being very good.	Baay'ee gaarii ta'uu.
It wasn't going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin turre.
I love you all my children	Ijoollee koo hunda keessan nan jaalladha
He was lucky that didn’t happen.	Carraa qaba ture akkas hin taane.
That’s one of my names.	Maqaa koo keessaa tokko kanuma.
I knew nothing better.	Kana caalaa homaa hin beeku ture.
Would be a problem if.	Silaa rakkoo ta'aa osoo.
She’s not interested in me.	Isheen naaf fedhii hin qabdu.
That is often the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas taʼa.
Not a bad idea.	Yaada hamaa miti.
I hadn’t really thought this through	Kana sirriitti hin yaadne ture
She needed a drink.	Dhugaatii ishee barbaachisa ture.
I want to stay.	Ani turuu barbaada.
He would have been that person.	Silaa nama sana ta'a ture.
We have to live a life.	Jireenya jiraachuu qabna.
Look at that girl over there.	Intala sana achi ilaalaa.
I began to see myself	Of arguu jalqabe
They are all the same.	Hundi isaanii kanuma.
I don’t like them.	Ani isaan hin jaalladhu.
Most of the time she was mean to us.	Yeroo baay'ee isheen nutti hamaa turte.
He wants great things with you	Si waliin waan guddaa barbaada
I couldn’t sleep, at all	Hirriba hin dandeenye, tasumaa
I’d rather be at home.	Mana kootti naaf wayya.
I have to do that.	Sana gochuun qaba.
But I'm not so sure.	Garuu hangas mirkanaa'aa miti.
I think we did enough for tonight	Halkan kanaaf waan gahaa hojjenne natti fakkaata
He doesn’t do this every time you want him to.	Yeroo barbaaddu hunda kana hin godhu.
Nothing can happen without a sufficient reason	Sababa gahaa malee wanti ta’uu hin danda’u
Again, it wasn’t quite right.	Ammas, guutummaatti sirrii hin turre.
You have to make this work.	Kana akka hojjetu gochuu qabda.
Of course, you can’t.	Akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
He wants to know everything	Waan hundumaa beekuu barbaada
I just can't live without them for long	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan malee jiraachuu qofa hin danda'u
I can't believe my eyes	Ija koo amanuu hin danda'u
I couldn't believe it was her	Ishee ta'uu ishee amanuu hin dandeenye
I can't help you much with this one	Isa kanaan baay'ee si gargaaruu hin danda'u
He wondered if she knew.	Isheen beektaa jedhee yaade.
We don't have her anymore.	Kana booda akka ishee hin qabnu.
I know you’re not doing it alone	Ati kophaa kee akka hin hojjenne nan beeka
To say it’s not important is just not true.	Barbaachisaa miti jechuun dhugaa miti qofa.
They had done nothing together.	Waliin homaa hin hojjenne turan.
Maybe you were right.	Tarii ati sirrii turte ta'a.
I wanted to be one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu barbaade
I don’t have to tell you this	Kana sitti himuu hin qabu
Even his house.	Mana isaa illee.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
They are doing everything right.	Waan hunda sirriitti hojjechaa jiru.
He didn’t want his money.	Maallaqa isaa hin barbaanne.
I knew it wasn’t	Akka hin taane nan beeka ture
Look at her carefully.	Sirriitti ishee ilaalaa.
No one in the house knows.	Mana keessatti namni beeku hin jiru.
Not many people.	Namoonni baay'een miti.
We had shoes.	Kophee qabna turre.
No one would have been able to find it.	Silaa namni tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u ture.
Couldn't have asked for much more	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee gaafachuu hin danda'u ture
This wasn't happening.	Kun ta'aa hin turre.
I haven’t seen it before	Kanaan dura hin argine
This is just not true.	Kun dhugaa miti qofa.
This had better be good.	Kun gaarii ta'uu wayya ture.
There seemed to be no hope for him.	Abdiin isaaf waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
But maybe.	Garuu tarii.
But we have little time.	Garuu yeroo xiqqoo qabna.
He was extremely happy.	Garmalee gammade.
I said I don't have anything like that.	Ani waan akkasii hin qabu jedheen.
He had to be all good, he had to be.	Inni hunda gaarii ta'uu qaba ture, ta'uu qaba ture.
You know that it is.	Akka ta'e ni beekta.
That’s a good guy.	Sun gurbaa gaarii dha.
I don't think it will happen.	Ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadu.
You have to be a little housewife.	Haadha manaa xiqqoo ta'uu qabda.
She said so, but it wasn’t true.	Akkas jette, garuu dhugaa hin turre.
Perhaps it still does.	Tarii amma iyyuu ni taʼa.
He had the money.	Maallaqa sana qaba ture.
But it wasn’t necessary.	Garuu hin barbaachisu ture.
I had no idea that such a thing could happen	Wanti akkasii taʼuu akka dandaʼu yaada hin qabu ture
But there is something else, something sinister.	Garuu wanti biraa jira, wanti hamaa.
I can never see myself with anyone else	Nama biraa wajjin gonkumaa of arguu hin danda'u
This is not an idea.	Kun yaada miti.
At that point it probably was.	Yeroo sanatti tarii ta'uu hin oolu.
Now he even has a new job!	Amma hojii haaraa illee qaba!
And it happened again.	Ammas ta'e.
For this night.	Halkan kanaaf.
He looked a lot like you back then	Yeroo sanatti baay'ee si fakkaata ture
That we were one.	Akka nuti tokko turre.
She shouldn’t care, not anymore.	Isheen dhimma qabaachuu hin qabdu, kana booda miti.
I will never know why	Maaliif akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku
I have no idea where you’re going.	Eessa akka deemtu yaada hin qabu.
They were trying to do things right.	Waan sirriitti hojjechuuf yaalaa turan.
One is with me, on the way.	Tokko na waliin jira, karaa irra jira.
I have no idea what to tell you	Waan sitti himu yaada hin qabu
I know she loves seeing you	Isheen si arguu akka jaallattu nan beeka
Sounds great and is in very good condition.	Sagalee guddaa qaba, haala baayyee gaarii irra jira.
He thought for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf yaade.
She certainly doesn’t care.	Isheen dhimma akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
But, that’s life.	Garuu, sun jireenya.
She was watching.	Isheen ilaalaa turte.
They have no children like us.	Akkuma keenya ijoollee hin qaban.
I was the one in the wrong	Ani isa dogoggora keessa ture
I often do that with her	Yeroo baayyee ishee waliin akkas nan godha
But he would never, ever make a mistake about me.	Garuu inni gonkumaa, gonkumaa waa'ee koo dogoggora hin hojjetu ture.
Love that dog.	Saree sana jaalladhu.
Now that works perfectly fine.	Amma sun guutummaatti gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
You are not your job.	Ati hojii kee miti.
This time I go alone	Yeroo kana kophaa koo nan deema
I am not your wife.	Ani haadha manaa kee miti.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
Not in our house.	Mana keenya keessa miti.
This shouldn’t even have happened.	Kun illee ta’uu hin qabu ture.
I know what you mean	Waan jechuu barbaaddu nan beeka
That’s dangerous.	Sun balaa qaba.
I was just like her.	Anis akkuma ishee ture.
There is nothing you can do right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
No question about that	Waa'ee sanaa gaaffii hin qabu
I told him never to do that again.	Kana booda gonkumaa akkas akka hin goone itti hime.
I thought you would have liked them.	Silaa isaan jaallattu jedheen yaade.
I mean, that's what we've been doing	Akkas ta'aa turre jechuu kooti
I did, and now she is gone	Anis nan godhe, amma isheen hin jirtu
No problem with that, good for you.	Sana irratti rakkoo hin qabu, siif gaarii.
They had plenty of time, she said.	Yeroo hedduu qaban jette.
But of course that’s not entirely accurate.	Garuu sun guutummaatti sirrii akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He knew how to do that.	Akkamitti akkas godhu beeka ture.
I am absolutely nothing	Ani guutummaatti homaa miti
It looks like this from the top.	Irraa akkas fakkaata.
I'm not sure about anything	Ani waa'ee homaa mirkanaa'aa miti
I wasn't sure what she wanted me to say	Maal akkan jedhu barbaaddu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
All looked good.	Hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
Glad to have him here.	Asitti isa argachuu kootti gammadeera.
But it doesn't have to be all work.	Garuu hunda hojii ta'uu hin qabu.
I had to do it for you	Siif gochuun qaba ture
It would have been right.	Silaa sirrii ta'a.
Nothing more than meets the eye here	Ija waliin wal arguu caalaa asitti hin jiru
I want to know what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaada
I didn’t really know him.	Dhuguma isa hin beeku ture.
I didn’t belong here	Ani kan as hin turre
I wonder what he was looking for	Maal barbaadaa ture jedheen yaada
I should have asked you a question a long time ago.	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura gaaffii tokko si gaafachuu qaba ture.
But it is not complete.	Garuu guutuu miti.
It will be good to see him later	Booda yoo isa argine gaarii ta'a
It always was.	Yeroo hundumaa ture.
Nowadays.	Yeroo ammaa kana.
This is going on.	Kun deemaa jira.
I can't see my place	Bakka koo arguu hin danda'u
People have cars.	Namoonni konkolaataa qabu.
He just loves them.	Inni qofa isaan jaallata.
I didn’t see my father	Abbaa koo hin argine
It wasn’t a great light.	Ifa guddaa hin turre.
He could have helped him.	Silaa isa gargaaruu dandaʼa ture.
That was a great thing.	Sun waan guddaa ture.
He has a good sense of humor	Miira qoosaa gaarii qaba
I am no longer one of them.	Ani kana booda isaan keessaa tokko miti.
They have no idea what happened.	Waan ta'e yaada hin qaban.
We were both bad.	Lamaan keenyayyuu hamaa turre.
No one wants him here.	Asitti namni isa barbaadu hin jiru.
You can't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeessu.
So that was all good.	Kanaaf sun hundi gaarii ture.
I thought this would be good	Kun gaarii ta'a jedheen ture
I think we’ve been waiting a long time for her mom	Haadha ishee yeroo dheeraa eegaa turre natti fakkaata
Twenty years ago, no one had one.	Waggaa 20 dura namni tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I didn’t know what to think	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture
I didn't see you around	Naannoo si hin argine
This probably has two reasons.	Kun sababa lama qabaachuu hin oolu.
Now she wouldn't do it for him.	Amma isheen isaaf hin gootu turte.
He was working full time	Yeroo guutuu hojjechaa ture
Of course I didn’t.	Akkan hin goone beekamaadha.
Now he spoke.	Amma dubbate.
This is a must!.	Kun gochuun dirqama!.
I wonder what’s with the light	Ifa waliin maaltu jira jedheen yaada
I know you can’t do that	Akkas gochuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
This is probably not true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
I know what you’ve been doing	Waan ati hojjechaa turte nan beeka
That’s how it started, before the light.	Akkasitti jalqabe, ifa dura.
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
But there was a reason.	Garuu sababni jira ture.
I love you so, so truly and completely.	Ani baay'een, baay'ee dhugaa fi guutummaatti si jaalladha.
It was long enough	Yeroo dheeraa gahaa ture
But he didn't tell anyone.	Garuu namatti hin himne.
I loved everyone and everything.	Nama hundumaa fi waan hundumaa nan jaalladha ture.
This is perfectly clear.	Kun guutummaatti ifaadha.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
I sit with this for a while	Kana waliin yeroo muraasaaf taa'a
It would be right but wrong.	Silaa sirrii ta'a garuu dogoggora.
I knew this was all too good to be true	Kun hundi dhugaa ta’uuf baay’ee gaarii akka ta’e nan beeka ture
She wouldn’t go without it.	Isheen malee hin deemtu turte.
That’s not our problem.	Sun rakkoo keenya miti.
So we don't have much time.	Kanaaf yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu.
It’s my job.	Hojii kooti.
She was wrong.	Dogoggora turte.
There is nothing he does not know.	Wanti inni hin beekne hin jiru.
I didn't see this.	Kana hin argine.
We were the same age.	Umuriin keenya tokko turre.
But there were a lot of mistakes.	Garuu dogoggora baay'een ture.
I thought it was really great	Dhuguma guddaa natti fakkaate
I should have said my father.	Silaa abbaa koo jechuun qaba ture.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
I didn't even know how	Akkamitti akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture
I really want to know.	Ani baay'een beekuu barbaada.
This time seemed different.	Yeroon kun waan adda ta'e fakkaata ture.
I really hope this goes somewhere	Kun bakka tokko akka deemu dhuguma abdiin qaba
So now you know what happened.	Kanaaf waan ta'e amma beekta.
He needs to know about you.	Waa'ee kee beekuu qaba.
It didn’t even have a name then.	Yeroo sana maqaa illee hin qabu ture.
But they were the lucky ones.	Garuu isaan warra carraa qaban turan.
I know he will.	Akka godhu nan beeka.
He wanted to do this.	Kana gochuu barbaade.
We are similar but different.	Nuti wal fakkaata garuu adda.
He was the real one.	Inni dhugaa ture.
I have many children	Ijoollee baay'een qaba
I couldn’t believe this.	Kana amanuu hin dandeenye.
Said.	Jedhe.
But it’s not good.	Garuu gaarii miti.
I, too, thought it was more old-fashioned.	Anis, bara durii caalaa natti fakkaate.
he asked me, smirking.	jedhee na gaafate.
About what is that.	Waa'ee maali sun.
No one else really knew what was going on in there.	Namni biraa dhuguma waan achi keessa ta'aa jiru beeku hin turre.
So it took time.	Kanaaf yeroo fudhate.
We can certainly do it here.	Asitti gochuu akka dandeenyu beekamaadha.
He should know this about me.	Waa'ee koo kana beekuu qaba.
It didn't seem like a lonely place	Bakka kophaa ta'e hin fakkaatu ture
Environment.	Naannoo.
Didn't do very well.	Baay'ee gaarii hin hojjenne.
I was very happy with this one.	Isa kanaan baayyee gammade.
Lots of pictures.	Suuraa baay'ee.
But she is still not in the light.	Garuu ammallee ifa keessa hin jirtu.
I didn’t mean to tell you that	Akkasitti sitti himuu hin barbaanne
But here it was different here.	Asitti garuu asitti adda ture.
I said it at the time	Yeroo sanatti jedheen ture
I think about it a lot	Waa'ee isaa baay'een yaada
It was unclear why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ifa hin turre.
I have no idea what it could be	Maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu
I don't know what's right.	Maaltu sirrii akka ta'e hin beeku.
I wouldn’t have known what else to do with myself	Silaa waan biraa ofitti godhu hin beeku ture
I didn't want to believe this was happening	Kun ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin barbaanne
He looked at what he was going to do.	Maal akka godhu ilaale.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
I wasn't good at that	Ani sana irratti ga'umsa hin qabu ture
It was just one of you.	Isin keessaa tokko qofa ture.
Just a week later.	Torban tokko booda qofa.
Not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf miti.
I'll be perfectly fine	Ani guutummaatti gaarii ta'a
But it hadn’t happened.	Garuu hin taane ture.
I had no idea what had come my way	Waan natti dhufe yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I had it up a lot a lot of the time	Yeroo baay'ee baay'een ol qaba ture
I have a lot to say about him	Waa'ee isaa waanan jedhu baay'ee qaba
I really like him a lot	Dhuguma baay'een isa jaalladha
It started this morning	Ganama kana jalqabe
He couldn’t do it alone.	Kophaa isaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t know what she meant.	Waan isheen dubbachuu barbaaddu hin beeku ture.
Last week was a different picture.	Torban darbe suuraa adda ta'e ture.
He’s dangerous.	Inni balaa qaba.
I mean, it shouldn't be	Ta'uu hin qabu jechuu kooti
I needed a job and I still do	Hojii na barbaachisa ture ammas nan barbaada
Most people are incompetent.	Namoonni baay'een ga'umsa hin qaban.
That definitely helps.	Sun akka gargaaru beekamaadha.
It works now.	Amma ni hojjeta.
But this is a possibility	Garuu kun ta'uu danda'a
I hope you don’t see me like that	Akkasitti akka na hin argine abdiin qaba
I know it looks bad, but nothing else happened	Hamaa akka fakkaatu nan beeka, garuu wanti biraa hin taane
I can't have too many.	Baay'ee qabaachuu hin danda'u.
Just not much now.	Amma qofa baay'ee miti.
Which is the worst so far.	Kan hanga ammaatti hamaa ta'e.
Obviously I’m interested	Fedhii akkan qabu ifaadha
Clearly, that was not the case here.	Asitti akkas akka hin turre ifaadha.
I am not like him.	Ani akka isaa miti.
I didn’t tell you any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee sitti hin himne
I wanted to live a little	Xiqqoo jiraachuu barbaade
I don’t need any help doing that.	Sana gochuuf gargaarsa tokkollee na hin barbaachisu.
I didn’t know what to do before	Kanaan dura maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I wasn't sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It’s not going to work anymore.	Kana booda hojjechuuf hin deemu.
It wasn’t right anymore.	Kana booda sirrii hin turre.
But he knows one thing.	Garuu waan tokko beeka.
He has something like that.	Inni waan akkasii qaba.
Like so many times before.	Akkuma yeroo baay'ee kanaan dura.
I went with my mother	Haadha koo waliin deeme
I can stay a little longer	Xiqqoo turuu nan danda'a
He doesn't exist now.	Amma hin jiru.
I know someone is right for me	Namni naaf ta'u akka jiru nan beeka
I can't talk about it	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
There.	Achi.
She said she didn't have it.	Hin qabu jette.
Which she should be.	Kan isheen ta'uu qabdu.
Try it now.	Amma yaalaa.
Maybe he had.	Tarii qaba ture ta'a.
I can't believe everything that happened	Waan ta'e hunda amanuu hin danda'u
You can't give me too much.	Baay'ee naaf kennuu hin dandeessu.
Soon she was fully human again	Yeroo muraasa booda ammas guutummaatti nama taate
I didn’t know what else to do	Kan biraa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
A great man, she had said	Nama guddaa, jettee turte
We need to be very clear here.	Asitti baay’ee ifa ta’uu qabna.
I knew this was just one night	Kun halkan tokko qofa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Tarii xiqqoo, tarii baay'ee ta'a.
I just can't do it.	Ani qofa hin danda'u.
I have to go now.	Amma deemuun dirqama.
But nothing seems to work.	Garuu wanti hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
I think everyone did that	Namni hundi akkas godhe natti fakkaata
But I am not alone.	Garuu kophaa koo miti.
Of course, you can’t do that in this case.	Kana keessatti akkas gochuu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
, environment.	, naannoo.
I didn’t know what to think of that	Sana maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture
This long time	Yeroo kana dheeraa
We were making mistakes, bad mistakes.	Dogoggora, dogoggora hamaa hojjechaa turre.
Nothing ever happened about them.	Waa'ee isaanii wanti tokkollee ta'ee hin beeku.
We’re on it.	Irratti jirra.
I began to ask a question	Gaaffii tokko gaafachuu jalqabe
I think you know exactly what this is.	Kun maal akka ta'e sirriitti beektu jedheen yaada.
None of them spoke.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin dubbanne.
It seemed a little to me	Xiqqoo natti fakkaata ture
I looked at the picture again	Ammas suuraa sana ilaale
I know this place.	Bakka kana nan beeka.
Walk through them.	Isaan keessa deemaa.
I could talk to my father	Abbaa kootti dubbachuu nan dandaʼa ture
You can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
I can't leave him now	Amma isa dhiisuu hin danda'u
I have no idea what happened	Waan ta'e yaada hin qabu
But we realized he was just doing his job.	Garuu hojii isaa qofa akka hojjetu hubanne.
He didn't want me to come.	Akkan dhufu hin barbaanne.
I know your father, and your mother	Abbaa kee, fi haadha kee nan beeka
Again, it is only a matter of time.	Ammas dhimma yeroo qofa.
Sometimes you’re going to do them.	Yeroo tokko tokko isaan hojjechuuf jirta.
I just thought everyone knew.	Namni hundi waan beeku qofa natti fakkaate.
I didn’t think he understood me	Inni waan na hubate natti hin fakkaatu ture
I don’t think they need it	Isaan waan isaan barbaachisu natti hin fakkaatu
I didn’t see it that way	Akkasitti hin argine
There is nothing but me.	Ana malee wanti jiru hin jiru.
I thought it might be nice if it was longer	Osoo dheeraa ta'ee gaarii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
But there is a problem.	Garuu rakkoon jiru jira.
I can't leave one of you	Isin keessaa tokko dhiisuu hin danda'u
She was adorable.	Isheen namatti tola turte.
He isn’t.	Inni miti.
That was the case 20 years ago.	Waggaa 20 dura akkas ture.
He does that.	Akkas godha.
This was what she needed.	Kun waan ishee barbaachisu ture.
He was there even longer than I was.	Inni ana caalaa illee yeroo dheeraa achi ture.
I love her and her work	Ishee fi hojii ishee nan jaalladha
The eye of the self.	Ija ofii.
This one doesn’t.	Inni kun hin godhu.
I still don't agree.	Ammas walii hin galle.
It’s just you and me tonight.	Halkan kana ana fi si qofa.
I still cared a lot about him	Ammallee baay'een isaaf yaada ture
He needs an answer.	Deebii barbaada.
Finding her hand.	Harka ishee argachuu.
The daughter of the husband.	Intala abbaa manaa.
But really .	Garuu dhuguma .
I don't mean that.	Kana jechuu koo miti.
Now it wasn’t enough.	Amma gahaa hin turre.
I thought they were real.	Isaan dhugaa natti fakkaate.
I knew there was one, but not where	Tokko akka jiru nan beeka ture, garuu eessa miti
You are always there for me.	Yeroo hundumaa naaf jirta.
I know the job is dangerous	Hojiin sun balaa akka qabu nan beeka
Of course, that is no longer the case.	Kana booda akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I saw this man, I knew him well.	Nama kana arge, sirriitti isa beeka.
Getting his hands on it.	Harka isaa argachuu.
I didn’t exactly go to her	Ani sirriitti gara ishee hin deemne
I didn't want to be with her	Ishee waliin ta'uu hin barbaanne
Things would be great.	Silaa wanti guddaa ta'a.
So there we had it.	Kanaaf achitti qabna turre.
I knew it wasn’t his real name	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
But it’s not even quite like that.	Garuu guutummaatti akkas illee miti.
I don't know what to do.	Ani maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I am not non-existent like her.	Ani akka ishee kan hin jirre miti.
It was just an idea that had always been there.	Yaada yeroo hundumaa ture qofa ture.
I think of you all the time during the day.	Guyyaa keessaa yeroo hunda si yaada.
I love food.	Nyaata nan jaalladha.
Please get here.	Mee as gahaa.
We were in such a bad situation and we didn’t want it well.	Haala hamaa akkasii keessa turre akka gaariitti hin barbaanne.
We hope it works out well.	Akka gaariitti akka hojjetu abdii qabna.
A little man, one of many.	Nama xiqqoo, hedduu keessaa tokko.
There are only two jobs.	Hojiin jiru lama qofa.
When he tells.	Yeroo himu.
Two months ago.	Ji'a lama dura.
He was in a bad place	Bakka hamaa keessa ture
I don't agree with you.	Si waliin walii hin galle.
This week was a good one.	Torban kun gaarii ture.
But then it happens again with someone else, and again, and again.	Garuu sana booda ammas nama biraa wajjin ta’a, ammas, ammas ni ta’a.
Almost everyone can.	Namni hundi jechuun ni danda’ama.
I can't really say why.	Dhuguma maaliif jechuu hin danda'u.
I think these look just like them	Isaan kun akkuma isaanii fakkaatu jedheen yaada
Not even a little bit.	Xiqqoo illee miti.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
I think they will make two.	Lama ni godhu jedheen yaada.
I knew she had a job.	Hojii akka qabdu nan beeka ture.
He may be the one.	Inni ta'uu danda'a.
I saw the two of you together.	Lamaan keessan waliin arge.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
I haven’t been to that class yet	Kutaa sana hanga ammaatti hin deemne
That's it.	Kanuma.
I didn’t want that.	Ani akkas hin barbaanne.
She should have known that.	Silaa kana beekuu qabdi turte.
I don't think so	Ani kana hin yaadu
We need to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
Nothing more is going on.	Kana caalaa wanti deemaa jiru hin jiru.
I didn’t do enough	Ani gahaa hin hojjenne
But that’s dangerous.	Garuu sun balaa qaba.
Sometimes it would happen.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni taʼa ture.
Always doing the right thing.	Yeroo hundumaa waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuu.
I have nowhere else to go.	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin qabu.
I still couldn’t do that	Ammallee akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
I already know what she’s thinking	Waan isheen yaaddu duruu beeka
I hope it works out well.	Akka gaariitti akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
She is mine, mine, mine.	Isheen kan kooti, ​​kan kooti, ​​kan kooti.
But this will do the job.	Garuu kun hojii ni hojjeta.
Like tomorrow would have been nice.	Akka boru silaa gaarii ture.
I was right to do this	Kana gochuun koo sirrii ture
They have to eat.	Nyaachuu qabu.
But he didn't go.	Garuu hin deemne.
I didn't want him around anyone but me	Ana malee naannoo nama biraa akka ta'u hin barbaanne
She didn’t do anything.	Isheen homaa hin goone.
I don’t know who it was	Eenyu akka ture hin beeku
It didn’t seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu ture.
But no one was, really.	Garuu namni tokkollee hin turre, dhuguma.
I couldn’t get enough of him	Isa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye
I go there all the time	Yeroo hundumaa achi nan deema
But this had to be such a big deal.	Garuu kun waan guddaa akkasii ta'uu qaba ture.
I don't mean for this to happen	Kun akka ta'uuf jechuu koo miti
I would do that tomorrow	Boru akkas nan godha ture
It must be morning again.	Ammas ganama ta'uu qaba.
I was an idea.	Ani yaada tokko ture.
I was kind of sure.	Ani akka waan mirkanaa'aa ture.
It's never been right before.	Kana dura sirrii ta'ee hin beeku.
Making it clear that you don’t do anything else.	Waan biraa akka hin hojjenne ifa gochuu.
I want it to be my accident, not hers	Kan ishee osoo hin taane balaa koo akka ta'u nan barbaada
But it was a lot.	Garuu baay'ee ture.
He was in my room at the time	Yeroo sanatti kutaa koo keessa ture
I told him about it today	Har'a waa'ee isaa itti hime
These people looked like her.	Namoonni kun ishee fakkaatu turan.
But what we need to do goes further.	Garuu wanti gochuu qabnu kana caalaa deema.
I didn’t want to eat it	Nyaachuu hin barbaanne
I wonder what they are doing	Maal hojjechaa jiru jedheen yaada
I have the same issue	Anis dhimma wal fakkaatu qaba
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
I have one question though.	Gaaffii tokko qaba garuu.
He is not one of us.	Inni nu keessaa tokko miti.
But he doesn’t need to do that.	Garuu akkas gochuun isa hin barbaachisu.
I can't see who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e arguu hin danda'u.
It wasn’t a real thing.	Wanti dhugaa hin turre.
I doubt he could even have that feeling	Miira sana illee qabaachuu akka dandaʼu nan shakka
I can't say what's got me	Waan na qabu kana dubbachuu hin danda'u
You’re looking for each other.	Wal barbaaddu.
But something went wrong.	Garuu wanti tokko dogoggora ta'e.
I couldn’t see anything.	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
It was from his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa irraa ture.
I couldn't be with him anymore	Kana booda isa waliin ta'uu hin dandeenye
I have a big problem with that	Sana irratti rakkoo guddaa qaba
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
Mostly it was just one other girl.	Irra caalaa intala biraa tokko qofa ture.
I was teased a lot in school	Mana barumsaa keessatti baay'een qoosaa ture
If we can.	Yoo dandeenye.
He was evil.	Inni hamaa ture.
He gave me money.	Maallaqa naaf kenne.
I’m always watching.	Yeroo hundumaa ilaalaa jira.
I left, no problem	Anis ba'e, rakkoo tokko malee
It hasn’t happened yet.	Ammallee hin taane.
Lots of hands on them.	Harka baay'ee isaan irratti.
I hadn't even told him the most important part	Kutaa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e illee itti hin himne ture
But it’s not me.	Garuu ana miti.
I can't live like that anymore	Kana booda akkas jiraachuu hin danda'u
When this happens you have to drop everything to help him.	Yeroo kun ta'u isa gargaaruuf waan hundumaa dhiisuu qabda.
A very large amount.	Hamma baayyee guddaa ta'e.
Would love to do it again.	Ammas yoo hojjete ni jaallata.
Tell them why.	Maaliif akka ta'e itti himi.
He has the money.	Maallaqa qaba.
I just couldn’t go	Ani qofa deemuu hin dandeenye
It’s not something like that.	Waan akkasii miti.
I didn’t have that	Ani akkas hin qabu ture
He might be all of that.	Inni tarii sana hunda ta'uu danda'a.
I could get my thing	Waan koo argachuu nan danda'a ture
It doesn’t work without it.	Isa malee hin hojjetu.
It wouldn't have been like that.	Silaa akkas hin ta'u ture.
It was going to be a lot more than that	Kana caalaa baay'ee ta'uuf ture
Not now, not tonight.	Amma miti, halkan kana miti.
Just look at my father.	Abbaa koo qofa ilaalaa.
I want to be a good mom	Haadha gaarii ta'uu nan barbaada
So sorry for that.	Kanaaf dhiifama.
He still doesn't do anything.	Ammas homaa hin godhu.
People were not interested in this subject.	Namoonni dhimma kanaaf fedhii hin qaban turan.
I mean, look at him.	Isa ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
But this may not be easy.	Garuu kun salphaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Not as much as it should be.	Hamma ta'uu qabu miti.
But it was a must.	Garuu dirqama ture.
I mean, look at those two	Isaan lamaan sana ilaalaa jechuu kooti
I thought things would be different this time.	Yeroo kana wanti adda ta'a jedheen yaade.
You would do well to have them.	Isaan qabaachuu kee gaarii taʼa.
It’s not that big of a deal, by itself.	Waan hangas guddaa miti, ofuma isaatiin.
I didn’t understand what he meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaade hin hubanne
I don't know anything about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku
I didn’t think it worked	Hojjete natti hin fakkaatu ture
I know you can do it.	Akka dandeessu nan beeka.
I saw the eyes.	Ija arge.
He knew it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane beeka ture.
It's just ours.	Keenya qofa.
Tell me a little about it.	Waa'ee isaa xiqqoo natti himi.
They do important work.	Hojii barbaachisaa taʼe hojjetu.
He is still there.	Ammas achi jira.
He is, of course, right.	Inni, sirrii akka ta’e beekamaadha.
I think that’s how it goes	Akkasitti deema jedheen yaada
Medical work today.	Hojii yaalaa har'a.
I know I’m not the only one.	Ana qofa akka hin taane nan beeka.
Perhaps it was too late.	Tarii yeroon isaa darbe taʼuu dandaʼa.
I definitely don’t want to stay here	As turuu akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha
I shouldn’t have known that	Silaa sana beekuu hin qabu ture
But this time things were a little different.	Yeroo kana garuu wanti xiqqoo adda ta'e.
I hope it works.	Akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
Then he glanced at me.	Sana booda ija natti ilaale.
Boy, that’s really something.	Gurbaa, sun dhuguma waan tokko.
A very dangerous place, to be sure	Bakka baayyee balaa qabu, mirkanaa'aa ta'uuf
He doesn’t help.	Inni hin gargaaru.
Nothing is really what it seems.	Dhuguma wanti waan fakkaatu hin jiru.
I was no longer alone	Kana booda kophaa koo hin turre
They were like dogs.	Isaan akka saree turan.
I certainly don’t want you to know this	Kana akka beektu akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha
I wasn't sure he would	Akka inni godhu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I just can't see my life but in you	Jireenya koo si keessa malee arguu qofa hin danda'u
But none of them did.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
I don’t know where to go from here.	As irraa eessa akkan deemu hin beeku.
He was always into that kind of thing	Yeroo hundumaa waan akkasii keessa ture
He wouldn’t do anything like that.	Inni waan akkasii hin hojjetu ture.
If you are, I can't answer.	Yoo taate deebii kennuu hin danda'u.
I think you do that.	Ati akkas gootu natti fakkaata.
That someone was me.	Namni tokko ana akka ture.
There is no answer there.	Achitti deebii hin qabu.
He was in there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi keessa ture.
No one knows exactly what to do.	Namni maal akka godhu sirriitti beeku hin jiru.
One year too many.	Waggaa tokko baay'ee.
I didn't see what it was	Maal akka ta'e hin argine
I wasn't sure she wanted it well enough.	Isheen akka gaariitti akka barbaaddu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But this was easier said than done.	Kun garuu dubbachuu caalaa gochuu caalaa salphaa ture.
I know that's really wrong.	Sun dhuguma dogoggora akka ta'e nan beeka.
I was the one who did this	Kana kan godhe ana ture
But maybe, they will now.	Garuu tarii, amma ni ta'u.
It’s just not good enough.	Gaarii miti qofa.
But he did what he did.	Garuu waan hojjete.
This can't be my life.	Kun jireenya koo ta'uu hin danda'u.
Everything works already.	Wanti hundi duruu hojjeta.
It’s in the on.	Irratti keessa jira.
This is not easy to do.	Kun gochuun salphaa miti.
Not yet, man.	Ammas miti nama.
But you don’t think so.	Garuu akkas jettee hin yaaddu.
Something she wanted to say	Waan tokko isheen jechuu barbaade
I thought he was there	Achi jira jedheen yaade
At the same time, there were problems at home	Kanuma waliin mana keessatti rakkoon ture
So they were in them.	Kanaaf isaan keessa turan.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
I can't help but see it	Arguu dhiisuu hin danda'u
She was great.	Isheen guddaa turte.
I want you in my mouth	Afaan koo keessa si barbaada
It’s probably happened a lot of times.	Yeroo baay’ee ta’uu hin oolu.
I can't have everything	Waan hundumaa qabaachuu hin danda'u
I don’t have to.	Dirqama hin qabu.
I used to think it would be so bad	Duraan akkas hamaa ta'a jedheen yaada ture
This is my life now.	Kun amma jireenya kooti.
I didn't think so	Ani akkas hin yaadne
We still have a chance.	Ammas carraa qabna.
I seriously doubt it	Ani akka malee shakka
I never knew him, you know	Ani gonkumaa isa hin beeku, beekta
I know what he needs	Waan isa barbaachisu nan beeka
He's working up to it.	Hanga isaatti hojjechaa jira.
You don’t have to do this, you know.	Kana gochuu hin qabdu, beekta.
But it’s just a big deal.	Garuu dhimma guddaa qofa.
I think it’s a great idea.	Yaada guddaa natti fakkaata.
But I am not here	Ani garuu as hin jiru
It’s not a bad thing.	Waan hamaa miti.
No one really stands out.	Dhuguma namni adda ta'e hin jiru.
He was still looking up.	Ammallee ol ilaalaa ture.
That’s why he lives.	Kanaaf jiraata.
I think of you very much	Baay'een siif yaada
In this case.	Haala kana keessatti.
I couldn’t find anything.	Waan tokko argachuu hin dandeenye.
That that could ever happen.	Akka sun yoomiyyuu ta'uu danda'a.
I think it's a good idea.	Yaada gaarii natti fakkaata.
His feelings.	Miira isaa.
I love how it turned out	Akkamitti akka ta'e baay'een jaalladha
You can't say anything.	Waan tokko dubbachuu hin dandeessu.
Except it wasn’t herself.	Ofii ishee hin turre malee.
He knew them well.	Inni sirriitti isaan beeka ture.
I mean really bad.	Dhuguma hamaa jechuu kooti.
But with me it was different.	Ana waliin garuu adda ture.
But just how.	Garuu akkamitti qofa.
Everyone knows about them	Waa'ee isaanii namni hundi ni beeka
But now she had no clothes.	Amma garuu uffata tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
He wanted to talk more	Caalaatti dubbachuu barbaade
I say, never again.	Ani akkas jedha, kana booda gonkumaa.
I might say the problem.	Rakkoon jechuu danda'a.
That said it's still not good enough.	Sun jedhe ammallee gaarii miti.
It's just not on it.	Irratti hin jiru qofa.
Nothing is more important than that.	Kana caalaa wanti barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru.
I think he was a good man.	Nama gaarii ture natti fakkaata.
We didn’t get involved.	Nuti harka keessa hin galle.
I will do this.	Kana nan godha.
I had that my whole life	Jireenya koo guutuu sana qaba ture
But we really don’t.	Garuu dhuguma hin goonu.
I thought you must be here.	As jiraachuu qabda jedheen yaade.
I wanted to eat him	Anis isa nyaachuu barbaade
Now she was gone.	Amma isheen hin jiru turte.
I couldn’t do it.	Ani hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
It's a good joke, not his	Qoosaa gaarii malee kan isaa miti
Everyone is different.	Hundi adda adda.
Not for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf miti.
There was a lot going on around me.	Naannoo kootti waan baay'een ta'aa ture.
It’s not an easy thing.	Waan salphaa miti.
He can do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuu danda'a.
Not what was there but what wasn’t there.	Waan achi ture osoo hin taane waan hin jirre.
He could have known.	Silaa beekuu danda'a ture.
Better to live without it.	Isa malee jiraachuu wayya.
I wasn't sure you wanted me	Akka ati na barbaaddu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
No shoes here	Asitti kophee hin qabu
I shouldn’t have told him anything	Silaa homaa itti himuu hin qabu ture
I really like it	Dhuguma natti tola
He was right.	Inni sirrii ture.
People only have so much.	Namoonni hamma kana qofa qabu.
I know what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka
I wondered what had happened	Maaltu ta'e jedheen yaade
This is the most important part.	Kun kutaa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
There is only one reason to live.	Sababni jiraachuu qabnu tokko qofa.
I was just as bad as they were	Anis akkuma isaanii hamaa ture
Maybe no one ever will.	Tarii namni yoomiyyuu hin godhu ta'a.
I don't know what's wrong	Waan dogoggora ta'e hin beeku
A lot of things can go wrong.	Waan baay'een dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
That’s all he was willing to do	Kana gochuuf qofa fedhii qaba ture
I was never sure why	Maaliif akka ta'e gonkumaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I have no idea what just happened	Waan amma ta'e yaada hin qabu
But it's good.	Garuu gaarii dha.
I’m not good with people.	Ani namoota waliin gaarii miti.
We had little in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu xiqqoo qabna turre.
I was one lucky man	Ani nama carraa qabu tokko ture
But he needs it.	Garuu isa barbaachisa.
I couldn’t see inside	Keessa arguu hin dandeenye
I know you want to help	Gargaaruu akka barbaaddu nan beeka
I could have everything	Waan hundumaa qabaachuu nan danda'a ture
It’s just so out there.	Akkas qofa achi keessa jira.
I'm thinking about it	Ani itti yaada
I didn't want to tell the truth.	Dhugaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
I love you so much.	Baay'een si jaalladha.
I didn't know what was going on at the time, of course.	Yeroo sanatti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture, beekamaadha.
There may be more than one.	Tokko ol ta’uu danda’a.
He stared at his eyes for a moment, watching.	Yeroo muraasaaf ija isaa ilaale, ilaalaa.
I knew the name.	Maqaa sana nan beeka ture.
Many, many years.	Waggaa hedduu, hedduu.
I’ve been waiting for this my whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu kanaaf eegaa ture.
I thought it was great there	Achitti guddaa natti fakkaate
But he doesn't have the money.	Garuu qarshii hin qabu.
I know my way around	Karaa koo nan beeka
There is a possibility that this could be true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu akka danda'u carraan jira.
I couldn’t believe she really wanted me	Dhuguma akka na barbaaddu amanuu hin dandeenye
I didn't know it was her dog	Saree ishee ta'uu hin beeku ture
But it does so much more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa waan baay'ee hojjeta.
He was pretty sure he got his way	Karaa isaa baay'ee akka argate mirkanaa'aa ture
I really have to go, girl	Dhuguma deemuun qaba intala koo
I could get my thing.	Waan koo argachuu nan danda'a ture.
What is this?.	Kun maali?.
Become one with your environment.	Naannoo keessan waliin tokko ta'aa.
He may be out for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf ala ta'uu danda'a
I always wanted to have a dog house	Yeroo hundumaa mana saree qabaachuu nan barbaada ture
I needed the job.	Hojiin sun na barbaachisa ture.
But that’s exactly what you need to do.	Garuu sirriitti kanuma gochuu qabdu.
Not one, but many.	Tokko miti, hedduu.
But we are trying.	Garuu yaalaa jirra.
He has a new hat.	Kophee haaraa qaba.
I want her to go home with you	Akka isheen si waliin gara manaatti deemtu nan barbaada
Good luck .	Carraa gaarii .
I don't have anything.	Ani homaa hin qabu.
He did everything he could.	Waan danda'u hunda godhe.
He shouldn’t be around	Naannoo isaa jiraachuu hin qabu
It didn’t go well.	Akka gaariitti hin deemne.
I still do that.	Ammallee akkas nan godha.
I need to get him to tell me everything	Waan hundumaa akka natti himu gochuun na barbaachisa
We wanted to do something about that.	Sana irratti waan tokko gochuu barbaanne.
No one has me and no one ever will.	Namni na hin qabu namni yoomiyyuu hin qabu.
They had to come.	Dhufuu qabu turan.
It didn’t seem bad at the time.	Yeroo sanatti hamaa hin fakkaatu ture.
That’s how it’s always been.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
I can't go back there.	Achitti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
I really, really, exist	Ani dhuguma, dhuguma, jira
She didn’t always think that way.	Yeroo hunda akkasitti hin yaaddu turte.
It’s not what it seems.	Waan fakkaatu miti.
There was no time.	Yeroon hin turre.
. . . .	.
Even their own.	Kan isaanii illee.
The problem with that.	Rakkoon sanaa.
We have that they are not.	Isaan akka hin taane ni qabna.
I don't think we understand each other.	Waan wal hubanne natti hin fakkaatu.
So we did something a little different.	Kanaaf waan xiqqoo adda ta'e hojjenne.
It was easier than that.	Kana caalaa salphaa ture.
He asked after you.	Si booda gaafate.
He still wasn't quite right, of course.	Inni ammallee guutummaatti sirrii akka hin turre beekamaadha.
He went away again.	Ammas deeme.
That's how I'm looking at it.	Akkasitti ilaalaa jira.
I want to be a guy	Ani gurbaa ta'uu barbaada
But they are wrong about us.	Garuu waa'ee keenya dogoggora qabu.
I always wanted to do something else	Yeroo hundumaa waan biraa hojjechuu nan barbaada ture
But you are my wife.	Ati garuu haadha manaa kooti.
You must never leave me.	Gonkumaa na dhiisuu hin qabdu.
Lots of work.	Hojii baay'ee.
You just have your hands.	Harka kee qofa qabda.
In other words, they can buy and eat.	Kana jechuun, bitachuu fi nyaachuu danda’u.
I don't see him as often outside of work.	Hojiin ala akka yeroo baay'ee isa hin argine.
He should never have done that	Silaa gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture
I should never have come here.	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture.
I can't see much of anything now	Amma homaa baay'ee arguu hin danda'u
After seeing what you did, you are gone	Waan ati goote arge booda ati hin jirtu
I didn’t really think about this	Kana sirriitti hin yaadne
So take a good look at it.	Kanaaf akka gaariitti ilaalaa.
I couldn't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye.
Morning.	Ganama.
He does, how.	Inni ni godha, akkamitti.
I hope this helps you a bit.	Kun xiqqoo akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I don’t want them here.	Asitti isaan hin barbaadu.
But it is a must.	Garuu dirqama.
He had us there.	Achitti nu qaba ture.
So you can have a teacher.	Kanaaf barsiisaa qabaachuu dandeessa.
It must have been before.	Kanaan dura ta’uu qaba.
They may be.	Ta'uu danda'u.
I couldn’t live without him	Isa malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I love goodwill.	Fedhii gaarii nan jaalladha.
Not acting, exactly.	Taphachuu miti, sirriitti.
But that was not a good place.	Garuu sun bakka gaarii hin turre.
I had more questions than answers	Deebii caalaa gaaffii baay'een qaba ture
You definitely want to.	Ati akka barbaaddu beekamaadha.
You have to do this for me.	Kana naaf gochuu qabda.
But I don't think so.	Ani garuu akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
I told him it was really great	Dhuguma guddaa akka ta'e itti hime
Of her time.	Kan yeroo ishee.
I have nothing to say.	Waan jedhu hin qabu.
That wasn't happening.	Sun ta'aa hin turre.
I still have no chance.	Ammas carraa hin qabu.
It's not really about the idea.	Dhuguma waa'ee yaada miti.
Now it is clear to me.	Amma naaf ifaadha.
They have a lot to do.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabu.
He said my wife.	Haadha manaa koo jedhe.
I knew that was wrong	Sun dogoggora akka taʼe nan beeka ture
I can't really have a house girl	Dhuguma intala manaa qabaachuu hin danda'u
I want to be like you	Anis akka kee ta'uu barbaada
It just doesn't have much.	Waan baay'ee hin qabu qofa.
Who wants to be.	Kan ta'uu barbaadu.
I don't know at all.	Ani tasumaa hin beeku.
He looked at her.	Ishee ilaale.
This thing had none of that.	Wanti kun sana keessaa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
But not, really.	Garuu miti, dhuguma.
The two men did not speak.	Namoonni lamaan hin dubbanne.
I wanted something in my mouth	Afaan koo keessa waan tokko barbaade
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii dha.
Maybe not as bad as it used to be, but still.	Tarii akka durii hamaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a, garuu ammas.
I knew you were gone.	Akka ati hin jirre nan beeka ture.
I knew what he was saying	Waan inni jedhu nan beeka ture
I need help around the house.	Gargaarsa naannoo manaa na barbaachisa.
Everyone else is going to stay another day.	Kan biraa hundi guyyaa biraa turuuf jira.
I didn't think this would happen	Kun ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne ture
But it went by so quickly.	Garuu akkas dafee darbe.
This is not just what happened here.	Kun waan asitti ta'e qofa miti.
I didn’t want any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
A little money	Maallaqa xiqqoo
I really wanted a picture of us together	Suuraa waliin taane baay'een barbaade
I love working on it	Irratti hojjechuu nan jaalladha
We are one.	Nuti tokko.
Now it's a reality.	Amma dhugaa ta'e.
I had so many questions	Gaaffii baay'een qaba ture
It didn’t go well.	Akka gaariitti hin deemne.
But she wouldn’t treat us like that.	Garuu akkasitti nu hin qabdu turte.
He needs sleep.	Hirriba isa barbaachisa.
I wish it wasn't, but it is	Osoo akkas hin taane natti tola, garuu akkas ta'a
They were there.	Achi turan.
Sounds like a great idea.	Yaada guddaa fakkaata.
I didn’t understand why he was alone	Maaliif kophaa akka ture naaf hin galle
We don’t have to stay in here.	As keessa turuu hin qabnu.
We did the right thing	Waan sirrii hojjenne
She's not here.	Isheen as hin jirtu.
This can’t be enough.	Kun gahaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
But he didn't.	Garuu hin goone.
I don't mean anything like that.	Waan akkasii jechuu koo miti.
I love talking about everything a lot	Waa'ee waan hundumaa baay'een dubbachuu nan jaalladha
I didn't need it.	Na hin barbaachifne.
I thought this was what she wanted.	Kana waan barbaaddu natti fakkaate.
That no one should live like he has.	Namni akka inni qabu jiraachuu akka hin qabne.
I don’t know, exactly.	Hin beeku, sirriitti.
I can’t seem to stop doing this	Kana gochuu dhiisuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
I couldn't do it	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye
I want to live with you	Si waliin jiraachuu barbaada
They have to do it themselves, but that rarely happens.	Ofii isaanii gochuu qabu, garuu sun yeroo muraasaaf ta’a.
I wish he was still with me	Ammallee osoo na waliin ta'ee natti tola
He had to speak up.	Dubbachuu qaba ture.
They were watching.	Isaan ilaalaa turan.
But you can go this way.	Garuu karaa kanaan deemuu dandeessa.
It was once in your shoes	Yeroo tokko kophee kee keessa ture
He told me his real name.	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa natti hime.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
It’s not an issue.	Dhimma miti.
But in the last night.	Garuu halkan darbe keessa.
She had nothing.	Homaa hin qabdu turte.
Very good question.	Gaaffii baayyee gaarii.
That’s really important.	Sun dhuguma barbaachisaa dha.
It's just the two of us.	Nu lama qofa.
I mean, everybody wants to work.	Namni hundi hojjechuu barbaada jechuu kooti.
That's what happens to us.	Kanuma nuuf ta'a.
I think it's one of two things	Waan lama keessaa tokko waan ta'e natti fakkaata
I was on my way home.	Anis karaa gara manaatti deemaa ture.
A lot more than you know.	Waan baay'ee waan ati beektu caalaa.
Maybe it's true.	Tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
I think so	Akkas jedheen yaada
He wasn’t real.	Inni dhugaa hin turre.
There is never a problem with food.	Nyaata irratti rakkoon gonkumaa hin jiru.
No one has an idea.	Namni yaada qabu hin jiru.
He wanted to believe her	Ishee amanuu barbaade
I knew it would be something great.	Waan guddaa akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
Not sure what else we can do.	Waan biraa maal gochuu akka dandeenyu mirkanaa'aa miti.
I couldn’t go any further	Kana caalaa deemuu hin dandeenye
I couldn’t believe it, I didn’t want to believe it.	Amanuu hin dandeenye, amanuu hin barbaanne.
Something that never happened.	Waan gonkumaa hin taane.
She doesn’t belong here.	Isheen kan as miti.
I just can't meet a potential husband	Abbaa manaa ta'uu danda'u waliin wal arguu qofa hin danda'u
It has two issues.	Dhimma lama qaba.
He loves us both.	Inni lamaan keenyayyuu ni jaallata.
I like them.	Isaan natti tola.
I don't think he's human.	Nama natti hin fakkaatu.
You don’t need to go any further.	Kana caalaa deemuun si hin barbaachisu.
I can't leave him now.	Amma isa dhiisuu hin danda'u.
I want to say	Jechuun barbaada
I can't believe he would do that	Akkas godha jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
But it rarely happens in real life situations.	Garuu haala jireenya dhugaa keessatti yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
I think he should have both of them.	Isaan lamaan qabaachuu qaba jedheen yaada.
I looked at yours.	Keessan ilaale.
I hadn’t thought about it	Ani hin yaadne ture
He often worked at night.	Yeroo baayʼee halkan hojjeta ture.
I loved everything he did.	Waan isa godhe hunda nan jaalladha ture.
This is life.	Kun jireenya.
He couldn’t find any.	Inni tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
I don't think so.	Ani akkasitti hin yaadu.
I love it so much.	Ani baay'een jaalladha.
I just couldn’t tell you before	Kana dura sitti himuu hin dandeenye qofa
You're about.	Ati waa'ee.
What works for me may not work for you.	Wanti naaf hojjetu siif hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
It doesn’t help here	Asitti hin gargaaru
It hasn't happened very often.	Yeroo baayyee hin taane.
It can work for you.	Siif hojjechuu danda'a.
I was there, you know	Ani achi ture, beekta
I am definitely interested in more	Kana caalaa fedhii akkan qabu beekamaadha
That was the most important thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe kanuma ture.
I need food	Nyaata na barbaachisa
I don’t mean it.	jechuu koo miti.
I’m just trying to see.	Arguu qofa yaalaa jira.
I don't think you can.	Ni dandeessu natti hin fakkaatu.
That was good enough.	Sun gaarii gahaa ture.
I hope it comes that way.	Akkas akka dhufu abdiin qaba.
That was just not necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa hin turre qofa ture.
They had one daughter	Intala tokko qaban turan
I think he’s going to go	Inni deemuuf deema jedheen yaada
You have nothing.	Ati homaa hin qabdu.
It was going bad.	Hamaa deemaa ture.
Right there.	Sirriitti achitti.
I got along really well with one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko waliin dhuguma akka gaariitti waliin ture
I didn’t think it was a good idea	Yaada gaarii natti hin fakkaatu ture
Maybe too good to be true.	Tarii garmalee gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
Only it didn't work very well.	Qofa baayyee gaarii hin hojjenne.
Just like this.	Akkuma kana qofa.
Together with together.	Waliin waliin.
I'm a little different.	Ani xiqqoo adda.
Very, very long.	Baayyee baayyee dheeraa.
Nothing else can do this.	Wanti biraa kana gochuu danda'u hin jiru.
It wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa hin turre.
He told me the truth.	Dhugaa natti hime.
It’s just not good enough.	Gaarii gahaa miti qofa.
This is obviously not true.	Kun dhugaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
Almost every day.	Guyyaa hunda jechuun ni danda'ama.
I don’t have a bad day.	Guyyaa hamaa hin qabu.
I didn't know about it	Waa'ee isaa hin beeku ture
He should stay with us.	Nu bira turuu qaba.
But something was different.	Garuu wanti tokko adda ture.
Not that that matters at all.	Sun tasumaa dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
All the work.	Hojii hunda.
But we had no excuse.	Garuu sababa hin qabnu turre.
It required a little imagination.	Yaada xiqqoo barbaada ture.
Mine worked so great.	Kan koo akkasitti guddaa hojjete.
No one knew where he had gone.	Eessa akka deeme namni beeku hin turre.
Look at this house.	Mana kana ilaalaa.
He has one.	Tokko qaba.
I didn’t mean any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee jechuu koo hin turre
You know it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa ni beekta.
I don't tell you anything.	Homaa hin himu.
He said it couldn't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u jedhe.
We still have a lot of work to do.	Ammallee hojii baay'ee qabna.
I needed something in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti waan tokko na barbaachisa ture.
There is a possibility.	Carraan jiru jira.
Great! 	Guddaa!
you think you’re right.	jettanii yaaddu.
I didn't say anything	Ani homaa hin dubbanne
Can't be too good.	Garmalee gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I want you to be there	Akka ati achi jirtu nan barbaada
That will never happen again.	Kana booda sun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
I really don't know why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I have no idea what my problem is	Rakkoon koo maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
I don’t look that good.	Ani akkas gaarii hin fakkaatu.
That’s what it was.	Kanuma ture.
I just didn't see how	Akkamitti akka ta'e qofa hin argine
Someone had to do it.	Namni tokko gochuu qaba ture.
You don't know about anything.	Waa'ee homaa hin beektu.
She was in the inner room.	Kutaa keessaa keessa turte.
I always knew when she was with her	Yeroo hundumaa yoom ishee wajjin turte nan beeka ture
Great doing about nothing in my eyes.	Ija koo keessatti waa'ee homaa hojjechuu guddaa.
I had no idea this was happening	Kun akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I wanted to go back to him	Gara isaatti deebi'uu barbaade
That wouldn't happen now.	Silaa amma sun hin ta'u ture.
But you don't.	Garuu hin gootu.
I think it will work	Ni hojjeta jedheen yaada
This doesn’t seem to work.	Kun waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
I need a good reason	Sababa gaarii na barbaachisa
I can't see how anything could work	Wanti tokko akkamitti hojjechuu akka danda'u arguu hin danda'u
I can't speak right now.	Yeroo ammaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I was home a lot.	Baay'een mana ture.
I didn’t really know either of them	Ani lamaan isaaniiyyuu dhuguma hin beeku ture
They often do.	Yeroo baay’ee ni godhu.
I don't think anyone knows exactly what's going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru namni sirriitti beeku waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
I know she would love to meet you	Si waliin wal arguu akka jaallattu nan beeka
You are the one.	Ati isa.
It was completely me.	Guutummaatti ana ture.
But that is not the case with us.	Garuu waa'ee keenya akkas miti.
I hope this helps someone.	Kun nama tokko akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
There was no one there.	Namni achi hin turre.
You could have been mine.	Silaa kan koo ta'uu dandeessa turte.
I wouldn't want it any other way	Karaa biraa akka ta'u hin barbaadu ture
I mean nothing to you	Siif jechuun homaa jechuu koo miti
But nothing works for me.	Garuu wanti naaf hojjetu hin jiru.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
I think he's a good man	Nama gaarii natti fakkaata
This is correct, of course.	Kun sirrii dha, beekamaadha.
Not now, but back then, it was.	Amma miti, garuu yeroo sanatti, ni ture.
I don't know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku
I'm not sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti.
We still need them.	Ammas isaan barbaachisa.
I told her that she of course could	Ani akka isheen beekamaadha akka dandeessu itti hime
I don't know what you're going to do to me.	Maal akka na gootu hin beeku.
She had no time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu hin qabdu turte.
I knew it would happen at some point	Yeroo tokko tokko akka ta'u nan beeka ture
I had no idea where she was	Eessa akka jirtu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I was hopeless and hopeless	Abdii fi abdii hin qabu ture
It does an exceptional job.	Hojii adda ta'e hojjeta.
I know what he wants to do	Waan inni gochuu barbaadu nan beeka
I think it’s a really easy job.	Hojii dhuguma salphaa natti fakkaata.
It could be a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
I love the feel of his mouth	Miira afaan isaa baay'een jaalladha
I hope to go there again	Ammas achi akkan deemu abdiin qaba
But it can be even more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa illee ta’uu danda’a.
That’s what we need.	Wanti nu barbaachisu sana.
But she still had a ways to go.	Garuu ammallee karaa itti deemtu qabdi turte.
I thought it was my picture.	Suuraa koo natti fakkaate.
This time though, it’s different.	Yeroo kana garuu, adda.
He now understood what he meant.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade amma hubate.
But a lot of it.	Garuu baay'ee.
I didn't know what to say	Waan jedhu hin beeku ture
Maybe it's not just money.	Tarii maallaqa qofa miti ta'a.
This is probably true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu hin oolu.
No one came.	Namni dhufe hin jiru.
I know you need to see her	Ishee arguu akka qabdu nan beeka
I just don’t want any of mine.	Ani kan koo tokkollee hin barbaadu qofa.
I don't know now.	Amma hin beeku.
Then it passed.	Sana booda darbe.
I couldn't have asked for more	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture
They all loved being with you.	Hundi isaanii si waliin taʼuu ni jaallatu turan.
You can do a couple of things.	Waan tokko lama hojjechuu dandeessa.
I like that to be true	Sun dhugaa ta'ee natti tola
I was already waiting for you	Duraan si eegaa ture
That may be true, but it’s not necessary.	Sun dhugaa ta’uu danda’a, garuu barbaachisaa miti.
I wanted nothing else	Kana malee homaa hin barbaanne
I am one of very many	Ani baayyee hedduu keessaa tokko
It's not about them.	Waa'ee isaanii miti.
We have a chance.	Carraa qabna.
I know there is something with the old house	Mana durii sana waliin waan tokko akka jiru nan beeka
Maybe she did.	Tarii isheen goote ta'a.
But that’s really the only reason.	Garuu dhuguma sababni isaa kana qofa.
I know you do.	Akka ati gootu nan beeka.
This reason, and the.	Sababni kun, fi kan.
I can't believe this is happening	Kun ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
That's all.	Kana qofa.
No one got it.	Namni argate hin jiru.
I really don't know what it is.	Dhuguma maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
I didn’t know it at the time	Yeroo sanatti hin beeku ture
It was something no one had seen before.	Waan kanaan dura namni hin argine ture.
He knew he had nowhere to go.	Bakka itti deemu akka hin qabne beeka ture.
I really wasn’t that interested at the time	Dhuguma yeroo sanatti hangas fedhii hin qabu ture
Everything we have.	Waan qabnu hunda.
There are two of us	Lama jirra
Then nothing happens.	Sana booda wanti ta'u hin jiru.
I know a few things about you.	Waa'ee kee waan muraasa beeka.
He did his job.	Hojii isaa hojjete.
I like that sort of thing	Waan akkasii natti tola
I love him, so much more	Ani isa jaalladha, kana caalaa baay'ee
She's not right.	Isheen sirrii miti.
It went well for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf akka gaariitti deeme.
I knew we could do this.	Kana gochuu akka dandeenyu nan beeka ture.
It couldn't have been easy.	Waan salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
There is nothing.	Homaa hin jiru.
He had somewhere to go, someone to be with	Bakka itti deemu, nama waliin ta'u qaba ture
Please take a closer look.	Mee akka gaariitti ilaalaa.
He says he's not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti jedha.
Maybe you already know about it.	Tarii waa'ee isaa duraan beektu ta'a.
I didn’t want to believe her	Ishee amanuu hin barbaanne
I intend to help you	Si gargaaruuf yaada qaba
I'm the one who should be.	Ani kan ta'uu qabu.
I didn’t intend to do this	Kana gochuuf hin yaadne
I didn’t mean that.	Ani akkas jechuu koo hin turre.
People are not like that.	Namoonni akkas miti.
Just a simple task.	Hojii salphaa qofa.
He never went to.	Inni gonkumaa gara.
Which is important.	Kan barbaachisaa ta'e.
I really don't understand how to deal with this problem.	Dhuguma rakkoo kana akkamitti akkan danda'u naaf hin galle.
I thought about it a lot later	Booda baay'een itti yaade
I thought there was hope with him	Isa waliin abdiin jira jedheen yaade
But, that doesn’t seem to be the case for long.	Garuu, yeroo dheeraaf akkas waan hin taane fakkaata.
It has to be a place.	Bakka ta'uu qaba.
I didn’t know she looked like that	Akkas akka fakkaattu hin beeku ture
It wasn’t true, though.	Dhugaa hin turre malee.
She was more important.	Isheen caalaatti barbaachisaa turte.
Good on them.	Isaan irratti gaarii.
One job.	Hojii tokko.
Except tonight.	Halkan kana malee.
This is not an easy task	Kun hojii salphaa miti
Completely different.	Guutummaatti adda.
Like clothes.	Akkuma uffata.
She was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii turte.
They are on the road.	Karaa irra jiru.
I think that’s dangerous.	Sun balaa qaba jedheen yaada.
They love their cars.	Konkolaataa isaanii ni jaallatu.
That's what he said.	Kana jedhe.
But it’s right.	Garuu sirrii dha.
You can't say that.	Akkas jechuu hin dandeessu.
You don't look like much.	Baay'ee hin fakkaattu.
I have nothing to say	Waan jedhu hin qabu
We got in there.	Achitti galle.
I didn’t know she had it in her	Ishee keessaa akka qabdu hin beeku ture
But they are almost identical.	Garuu wal fakkaatu jechuun ni danda'ama.
But that does little in the near future.	Garuu sun yeroo dhiyootti waan xiqqoo hojjeta.
I can believe everything you said	Waan ati jette hunda amanuu nan danda'a
I'm going to go like that.	Ani akkas nan deema.
she said.	jette.
It was a dog.	Saree ture.
That’s what makes you human.	Kan nama si godhu kanuma.
We have a good location.	Bakka gaarii qabna.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Matter.	Wanta.
That's what he loves the most.	Kan inni baay'ee jaallatu kanuma.
It must be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu qaba.
Just like you said.	Akkuma ati jette.
I was after one for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf tokko booda ture.
I can see it clearly	Ani sirriitti arguu nan danda'a
What he did was great.	Wanti inni hojjete guddaa ture.
Not telling anyone anything.	Namatti homaa himuu dhiisuu.
I have to do it .	Ani gochuu qaba .
I didn’t really know what to do this morning	Ganama kana maal akkan godhu dhuguma hin beeku ture
I think the job worked out well for him	Hojiin sun waan gaarii isaaf hojjete natti fakkaata
More than you know.	Kan ati beektu caalaa.
What is happening is possible.	Wanti ta'aa jiru ni danda'ama.
Little by little.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo xiqqoo.
I still think about what could be up there	Ammallee waan achi ol ta'uu danda'u nan yaada
So, there she was.	Kanaaf, achi turte.
Again, again, again.	Ammas, ammas.
Towards his day.	Gara guyyaa isaatti.
But it just wasn’t there yet.	Garuu ammallee qofa hin turre.
Not that there isn’t something here.	Asitti wanti tokko hin jiru jechuu miti.
But that was little help.	Garuu sun gargaarsa xiqqoo ture.
he asked himself.	jedhee of gaafate.
Mine hasn’t worked yet	Kan koo ammallee hin hojjenne
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
I hadn’t met him yet	Hanga ammaatti isa waliin wal hin argine ture
Maybe a lot of it.	Tarii baay'ee ta'uu danda'a.
He’s human, but we don’t have that against him.	Inni nama, garuu nuti sana isa irratti hin qabnu.
Your real name.	Maqaa kee isa dhugaa.
But no one asked her.	Garuu namni ishee gaafate hin turre.
A couple of days later she would have been gone	Guyyaa lama lama booda silaa hin jirtu turte
Not for this person, not just yet.	Nama kanaaf miti, amma qofa miti.
You know it's going to happen.	Akka ta'u beekta.
I wonder how they know.	Akkamitti beeku jedheen yaada.
I thought he was just lucky	Inni carraa guddaa qabu qofa jedheen yaade
Not like us.	Akka keenya miti.
I was his.	Ani kan isaa ture.
You often have no idea.	Yeroo baayyee yaada hin qabdu.
It didn’t matter if we knew.	Osoo beekne homaa hin turre.
He didn't.	Hin goone.
I think she was onto something	Waan tokko irra turte natti fakkaata
We were really in trouble.	Dhuguma rakkoo keessa turre.
It started out a lot.	Baay'ee jalqabe.
I don't even know what happened with her	Waan ishee waliin ta'e illee hin beeku
She was that kind of girl.	Isheen intala akkasii turte.
Maybe things would have been different back then.	Tarii yeroo sanatti wanti jiru adda ta'a ture.
That wouldn't be true.	Sun dhugaa hin ta'u.
Repeat after me boy, repeat after me.	Na booda irra deebi'i gurbaa, na booda irra deebi'i.
He rarely does that.	Inni yeroo muraasaaf akkas godhu.
I’m happy now.	Amma gammadeera.
But why does it matter.	Garuu maaliif dhimma qaba.
It’s not him.	Isa miti.
I can't do that for you	Ani akkas siif gochuu hin danda'u
It just happened so quickly.	Akkas dafee ta'e qofa.
One day when.	Guyyaa tokko yeroo...
This is still happening.	Kun ammallee ta'aa jira.
He didn't tell anyone	Kana namatti hin himne
He has a wife and three children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee sadii qaba.
Everyone knows this much.	Hamma kana namni hundi ni beeka.
I couldn't see if it was.	Yoo ta'e arguu hin dandeenye.
I would never be.	Ani gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
I thought about a lot of things at that point	Yeroo sanatti waan baay'een yaade
It was a little bit of everything.	Waan hundumaa keessaa xiqqoo ture.
I know what he means	Maal jechuu akka barbaade nan beeka
Not for this one.	Isa kanaaf miti.
But.	Garuu.
No one did anything.	Namni homaa hin goone.
I can't live without you	Si malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
He doesn't exist now.	Amma hin jiru.
To you she is just a name.	Siif isheen maqaa qofa.
Always the same mistake.	Yeroo hunda dogoggora wal fakkaatu.
Everything exists twice.	Wanti hundi yeroo lama jira.
Only for a short time.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
I didn't want to know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu hin barbaanne
I'm going to walk my dog.	Saree koo nan deema.
I can do this for you	Kana siif gochuu nan danda'a
Work clothes.	Uffata hojii.
All but nothing.	Hundi malee homaa miti.
He’s not really there.	Inni dhuguma achi hin jiru.
We need to do something, but we have no idea what.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna, garuu maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabnu.
It's all very clear.	Hundi isaa baayyee ifaadha.
Wait and see, wait and see.	Eegaa ilaalaa, eegaa ilaalaa.
She didn't have much time, she didn't need to.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabdu turte, hin barbaachisu ture.
They love each other	Wal jaallatu
I hope it wasn’t even this one	Inni kun illee akka hin turre abdiin qaba
It looked really great.	Dhuguma guddaa fakkaata ture.
It got out of my way.	Karaa koo keessaa ba'e.
I certainly know yours	Kan keessan akkan beeku beekamaadha
I don't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu.
No one is coming.	Namni hin dhufu.
I think she's probably the only one.	Ishee qofa ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada.
I still wish it was last year	Ammas bara darbe osoo ta'ee natti tola
I need a week.	Torban tokko na barbaachisa.
I wouldn’t have gone anywhere else	Silaa bakka biraa hin deemu ture
No one knows.	Namni hin beeku.
Last year something happened.	Bara darbe wanti tokko ta'e.
I thought it must be.	Ta'uu qaba jedheen yaade.
We need to work together on this.	Kana irratti waliin hojjechuu qabna.
But I don't like it	Ani garuu hin jaalladhu
voting for the.	sagalee kennuu.
Everyone really loves it.	Namni hundi dhuguma ni jaallata.
It can be dangerous.	Balaa ta'uu danda'a.
But it does, it does.	Garuu ni godha, ni godha.
This was the exception.	Kun kanaan ala ture.
Not right now.	Yeroo ammaa miti.
They must be.	Isaan ta’uu qaba.
Always.	Yeroo hundumaa.
I think that’s a good idea.	Sun yaada gaarii natti fakkaata.
I didn’t understand that at the time.	Yeroo sana sana naaf hin galle.
He could have done anything he wanted.	Silaa waan barbaade hunda gochuu danda'a ture.
I haven’t seen him in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf isa hin argine
He was there last year	Bara darbe achi ture
She was very good.	Baayyee gaarii turte.
she said.	jette.
I told him about me	Waa'ee koo itti hime
It seems so simple.	Akkas salphaa fakkaata.
I always love myself more	Yeroo hundumaa caalaatti of jaalladha
We were within a year or two of our age.	Umuriin keenya waggaa tokko lama keessatti turre.
I didn’t want to know more	Kana caalaa beekuu hin barbaanne
But you have to do something.	Garuu waan tokko hojjechuu qabda.
I mean, it just doesn’t exist.	Hin jiru qofa jechuu kooti.
There are many of us.	Nuti baay'ee jirra.
What happened.	Waan ta'e.
Not even my daughter.	Intala koo illee miti.
I can see a lot but a month	Ji'a tokko malee baay'een arguu danda'a
I couldn’t tell him that.	Akkas itti himuu hin dandeenye.
You probably know what that means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe beektu taʼa.
I don’t know anyone here	Asitti nama hin beeku
I wouldn’t have gone for it.	Silaa itti hin deemu ture.
I can't believe you did this.	Kana goote jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
I had no idea where he was	Eessa akka jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I know what you can do	Waan gochuu dandeessu nan beeka
Tell me about your wife and daughter.	Waa'ee haadha manaa fi intala kee kanaa natti himi.
I have no such desire	Fedhii akkasii hin qabu
I can't believe all this	Kana hunda amanuu hin danda'u
I wasn’t the person he wanted to see.	Ani nama inni arguu barbaadu hin turre.
You can see it in the picture.	Suuraa irratti arguu dandeessu.
I knew who you were, you know	Eenyu akka taate nan beeka ture, beekta
This is not the case, however.	Kun garuu akkas miti.
Good on them.	Isaan irratti gaarii.
I have no idea what is going on with this	Kana waliin maaltu akka jiru yaada hin qabu
A little goes a long way	Xiqqoo karaa dheeraa deema
You think you’re doing fine.	Ati waan gaarii hojjechaa jirtu sitti fakkaata.
I wonder why that is.	Maaliif akkas ta'e jedheen yaada.
He had a lot of work to do today.	Har'a hojii baay'ee hojjechuu qaba ture.
He certainly wasn’t.	Inni akka hin turre beekamaadha.
Still no one saw them.	Ammas namni isaan arge hin jiru.
If you haven't seen it, check it out.	Yoo hin argine ta'e ilaalaa.
I think it all works well	Hundi akka gaariitti hojjeta jedheen yaada
You know what, it really doesn’t matter.	Maal beekta, dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
But one can only ask so much.	Garuu namni tokko hanga kana qofa gaafachuu danda'a.
It’s a little different when you have to do that.	Yeroo sana gochuu qabdu xiqqoo adda.
He must get it.	Argachuu qaba.
I could work with that.	Sana waliin hojjechuu nan danda'a ture.
It wasn’t right, but he had to do it.	Sirrii hin turre, garuu gochuu qaba ture.
We are still doing so.	Ammas akkas gochaa jirra.
I was not a good wife	Ani haadha manaa gaarii hin turre
This will be a must.	Kun dirqama ta’a.
I was just sure of myself	Ofii koo qofa mirkanaa'aa ture
I know that part	Kutaa sana nan beeka
I didn't want you to think badly of me	Akka ati hamaa naaf yaaddu hin barbaanne
Everything went well.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'e.
He says it doesn’t matter, it’s okay.	Dhimma hin qabu, homaa miti jedha.
I'm still doing my best	Ammas waanan danda'u hunda gochaa jira
I think about her every day of my life	Jireenya koo keessatti guyyaa hunda waa'ee ishee nan yaada
Not that he meant it.	Jechuu isaa miti.
It was a long long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dheeraa dura ture.
You know you did.	Akka goote beekta.
But that's what's happening.	Garuu akkas ta'aa jira.
This must be a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta'uu qaba.
This is a good one.	Kun gaarii dha.
What is this.	Kun maali.
Now it was different.	Amma adda ture.
I saw her this morning	Har'a ganama ishee arge
We had shoes.	Kophee qabna turre.
I'll be them.	Ani isaan ta'a.
It was the real one.	Kan dhugaa ture.
I'm interested in what's happening though	Waan ta'aa jiru garuu fedhii qaba
There is nothing wrong with it.	Homaa itti hin jiru.
But there is a reason.	Garuu sababni isaa jira.
It mattered to him.	Isaaf dhimma qaba ture.
It’s a really good feeling.	Dhuguma miira gaarii dha.
But it wouldn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u ture.
I didn't know that.	Kana hin beeku ture.
They are not like that at all.	Isaan tasumaa akkas miti.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
But it wasn’t enough.	Garuu gahaa hin turre.
Not on this.	Kana irratti miti.
Just stay with me.	Na bira turuu qofa.
This will not be easy.	Kun salphaa hin ta'u.
But I know someone who has it	Nama qabu garuu nan beeka
He still cared about it.	Ammas dhimma itti ba'e.
I knew your father well	Abbaa kee sirriitti beeka ture
It could have been.	Silaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
It’s my parents.	Warra kooti.
But that doesn’t work anymore.	Garuu sun kana booda hin hojjetu.
I didn’t do that.	Ani akkas hin goone.
That’s important here.	Asitti sun barbaachisaa dha.
I have a reason	Ani sababa qaba
I think he was waiting for you	Inni si eegaa ture natti fakkaata
A truly unique home.	Mana dhuguma adda ta'e.
He thought he could do better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandaʼa jedhee yaade.
Such a good guy.	Gurbaa gaarii akkasii.
I didn’t want him to come with me	Akka inni na waliin dhufu hin barbaanne
But I didn't do anything	Ani garuu homaa hin goone
She did it.	Ni goote.
He shouldn't do that.	Akkas gochuu hin qabu.
To do this.	Kana gochuuf.
I thought she was doing so well	Akkas gaarii hojjechaa turte natti fakkaate
I will do it now.	Amma nan godha.
He found one.	Tokko argate.
I’m not going to do that	Ani akkas gochuuf hin deemu
I thought you were	Ani sitti fakkaate .
I should have told you a long time ago	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura sitti himuu qaba ture
He was so right.	Inni akkas sirrii ture.
This time around.	Yeroo kana.
Then again, you never know.	Sana booda ammas, ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
It's about my daughter now.	Waa'ee intala kooti amma.
This is new to him.	Kun isa irratti haaraa dha.
This can work.	Kun hojjechuu danda'a.
But it could include more.	Garuu kana caalaa of keessaa qabaachuu danda'a.
It couldn't be, but it is.	Ta'uu hin dandeenye, garuu ni jira.
This is three days.	Guyyaa sadii kan ta'e kana.
That’s what he did that night.	Halkan sana akkas godhe.
He could still do it.	Ammas ni dandaʼa ture.
I mean, there were always people around.	Yeroo hunda namoonni naannoo sana turan jechuu kooti.
Something she has to make happen.	Waan isheen akka ta'u gochuu qabdu.
I don't have to believe him	Isa amanuu hin qabu
I’ve known you for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf si beeka.
A true man does what he has	Namni dhugaa waan qabu hojjeta
There may be irregular sounds.	Sagalee sirrii hin taane jiraachuu danda’a.
A lot of work is still needed.	Ammas hojiin baay'een barbaachisa.
I was right, you know	Ani sirrii ture, beekta
You know it's a real girl.	Intala dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekta.
I say alone time, of course	Yeroo kophaa koo nan jedha, beekamaadha
How can it be.	Akkamitti ta'uu danda'a.
I wondered what all this could mean	Kun hundi maal jechuu danda'a jedheen yaade
It was a great day here.	Asitti guyyaa guddaa ture.
It was a nonsense.	Waan hin taane ture.
I can make it go away	Ani akka inni deemu gochuu nan danda'a
Not if you say so, girl.	Yoo akkas jette miti intala.
It wouldn’t have gone that far	Silaa hangas hin deemu ture
But there is no such thing there.	Garuu achitti wanti akkasii hin jiru.
This was one of my passions.	Kun fedhii koo tokko ture.
Look at the clock.	Sa'aatii ilaalaa.
While he couldn't go back.	Osoo deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
I know it’s not right	Sirrii akka hin taane nan beeka
He could never find it.	Inni gonkumaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I am currently looking at your pictures	Yeroo ammaa kana suuraa keessan ilaalaa jira
I would have gone with her	Silaa ishee waliin deema ture
I already knew, pretty much, what was happening	Duraan beeka, baay'ee, waan ta'aa jiru
I wish he hadn’t gone	Osoo hin deemne natti tola ture
A girl with no clothes	Intala uffata hin qabne
Sorry, you .	Dhiifama, ati .
I don't think it's a possibility.	Waan ta'uu danda'u natti hin fakkaatu.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
For a long time no one could speak.	Yeroo dheeraaf namni dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I couldn’t live in it again.	Ammas keessa jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
But that’s not entirely the case.	Garuu guutummaatti kana miti.
This one definitely still needs work.	Inni kun ammallee hojii akka barbaadu beekamaadha.
I may never even find him	Tarii gonkumaa isa argachuu illee hin danda'u
All around you.	Naannoo kee hunda.
I need to do the right thing for him	Waan sirrii isaaf gochuun na barbaachisa
It was her voice.	Sagalee ishee ture.
I was pretty sure.	Baay'een mirkanaa'aa ture.
Why are we there	Maaliif jirra .
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
I like that you care so much	Ati baay'ee naaf yaaddu natti tola
I was alone at the time	Yeroo sana kophaa koo ture
He’s the one with the real problem.	Rakkoo dhugaa kan qabu isa.
I couldn’t stay there for long	Yeroo dheeraaf achi jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I think that’s all you have to do	Kana qofa gochuu qabda jedheen yaada
I was looking at you for it, you know	Isaaf si ilaalaa ture, beekta
It was much more than that.	Kana caalaa baayʼee ture.
Everything just has to work.	Wanti hundi hojjechuu qofa qaba.
I love your voice.	Sagalee kee baay'een jaalladha.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
That was almost two years ago.	Sun waggaa lama dura jechuun ni danda’ama.
But it usually works.	Garuu yeroo baayyee ni hojjeta.
It didn't seem too bad at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baayyee hamaa hin fakkaatu ture.
I love watches.	Sa'aatii baay'een jaalladha.
I just had your job	Hojii kee qofa qabaa ture
It wasn’t work, really.	Hojii hin turre, dhuguma.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.	Osoo akkas ta'ee as hin jirtu turte.
I need you to do something	Waan tokko akka gootu na barbaachisa
Nothing happens without Him.	Isa malee wanti ta'u hin jiru.
It may be, it may not be.	Ta'uu danda'a, ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I didn't realize that was such a problem	Sun rakkoo akkasii akka ta'e hin hubanne
I always thought I didn't know what it was	Yeroo hunda maal akka ta'e hin beeku jedheen yaada
But that's how it happened.	Garuu akkasitti ta'e.
I didn't know it was him	Isa ta'uu hin beeku ture
I don't know what else to tell you	Ani waan biraa sitti himu hin beeku
We should have done that first.	Dura sana gochuu qabna turre.
A stranger glanced back	Namni hin beekne tokko ija duubatti ilaale
But it wasn’t supposed to be like that.	Garuu akkas ta’uu hin qabu ture.
He said that it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane dubbateera.
They are looking for someone like them.	Nama akka isaanii barbaadaa jiru.
I’m with her now.	Amma ishee waliin jira.
I wonder what it could have been about	Silaa waa'ee maal ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
One came to me.	Tokko natti dhufe.
You’re like me.	Ati akka kooti.
That was a long time ago.	Sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
It’s not that great.	Akkas guddaa miti.
I get very lonely here	Asitti baay'een kophaa ta'a
This thing did it.	Wanti kun ni godhe.
It may be late.	Yeroo booda ta'uu danda'a.
Coming soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti.
Maybe they both have.	Tarii lamaan isaaniiyyuu qaban ta'a.
This is obviously incorrect.	Kun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
I wanted to ask him about it	Waa'ee kanaa isa gaafachuu barbaade
It’s just a mistake.	Dogoggora qofa.
I didn't have a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee hin qabu ture.
But they were.	Garuu ni turan.
They would do it again tomorrow.	Boru ammas ni godhu turan.
I almost didn't see it	Ani hin argine jechuun ni danda'ama ture
I was trying a lot	Baay'een yaalaa ture
I had no interest in it anymore	Kana booda fedhii tokkollee itti hin qabu ture
I think that takes some work	Sun hojii tokko tokko barbaada jedheen yaada
Most likely a little bit of both.	Baay'ee kan hin oolle xiqqoo lamaan isaanii ta'uu hin oolu.
A lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee.
I think so now.	Amma akkas natti fakkaata.
I mean, it was just an idea	Yaada qofa ture jechuu kooti
Like really, now.	Akka dhuguma, amma.
Every hour of every day.	Guyyaa hunda sa'aatii hunda.
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
That would be a lot.	Sun baay'ee ta'a.
It’s my business.	Dhimma kooti.
I can afford it, you know that	Ani qarshii nan danda'a, ati kana beekta
Many, many hours.	Sa'aatii hedduu hedduu.
I have another idea.	Yaada biraa qaba.
I can't play with anyone else	Kan biraa waliin taphachuu hin danda'u
I wouldn’t do that with a dog	Ani garuu saree wajjin akkas hin godhu ture
I didn't tell him to go back for this reason.	Sababa kanaaf duubatti deebi'i itti hin himne.
I was searching for answers	Deebii barbaadaa barbaadaa ture
So we have to ask.	Kanaaf gaafachuu qabna.
I should have told you everything	Silaa waan hundumaa sitti himuu qaba ture
There is nothing you can do about it.	Waan ati gochuu dandeessu tokkollee hin jiru.
This was not life.	Kun jireenya hin turre.
I have plenty of time.	Yeroo baay'een qaba.
It doesn’t matter if no one is here but us.	Nu malee namni as hin jiru homaa miti.
He was happy now, very happy.	Inni amma gammade, baay'ee gammade.
There must be more we can do.	Kana caalaa wanti nuti hojjechuu dandeenyu jiraachuu qaba.
He didn't talk about that.	Waa'ee sanaa hin dubbanne.
I couldn't believe what had happened	Waan ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
I really need to know that he will always love me	Dhuguma yeroo hundumaa akka na jaallatu beekuu qaba
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I became the reason.	Anis sababa ta'e.
He should have had a lot to say	Silaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu qaba ture
That would happen later.	Sun booda ta'a ture.
It will never be perfect.	Yoomiyyuu guutuu hin ta'u.
It can be, of course.	Ta’uu danda’a, beekamaadha.
That was always the worst that could happen.	Yeroo hundumaa wanti hamaa taʼuu dandaʼu sun ture.
All you have to do is fill it up.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu guutuu qofa.
He needs an answer.	Deebii barbaada.
But it still happens.	Garuu ammas ni ta'a.
I didn’t know how to go about it	Akkamitti akkan deemu hin beeku ture
You have to see him.	Isa arguu qabda.
I just told him what happened	Waan ta'e qofa itti hime
I'm not sure what exactly this means	Kun sirriitti maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku
He is here with me now.	Amma na waliin as jira.
I can't believe no one thought of it before	Kana dura namni itti yaade hin jiru jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I think you love me too much	Garmalee waan na jaallattu natti fakkaata
I didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I will always love him.	Yeroo hundumaa isa nan jaalladha.
Until then, everything is fine.	Hanga sanatti wanti hundi gaarii dha.
Wait, something was still not right.	Eegaa ammallee wanti tokko sirrii hin turre.
This is not really the case.	Kun garuu dhuguma akkas miti.
Some people are different	Namoonni tokko tokko adda
I have been watching them a lot	Baay'een isaan ilaalaa tureera
He gave me an idea.	Yaada naaf kenne.
It didn’t last long	Yeroo dheeraaf hin turre
Maybe two, three years ago.	Tarii waggaa lama, sadii dura.
I can't walk on it without me.	Ana malee irra deemuu hin danda'u.
You once had an idea.	Yeroo tokko yaada qabda turte.
That's what I thought.	Akkas natti fakkaate.
I can never be with her again	Amma booda yoomiyyuu ishee waliin ta'uu hin danda'u
That was all we wanted.	Nuti barbaanne kana qofa ture.
He looked up from his watch.	Sa'aatii isaa irraa ol ilaale.
You have to be clear on that.	Sana irratti ifa ta'uu qabda.
I'm sure you're right about that part.	Kutaa sanaa sirrii akka taate mirkanaa'adha.
He should have just been there	Silaa achi jiraachuu qofa qaba ture
It wouldn’t come if it wasn’t necessary	Osoo barbaachisaa hin taane hin dhufu ture
Of course, similar does not mean identical.	Wal fakkaata jechuun wal fakkaata jechuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I don't tell you anything	Homaa hin himu
I think it was probably a good idea.	Tarii yaada gaarii ture jedheen yaada.
No one ever does it.	Namni tokkollee gonkumaa hin godhu.
I knew the whole time	Yeroo sana guutuu nan beeka ture
Maybe, for him, we were.	Tarii, isaaf, nuti turre ta'a.
That probably means he doesn’t exist.	Kana jechuun tarii inni hin jiru jechuu ta’a.
He thought about it all day and all night	Guyyaa guutuu fi halkan guutuu itti yaade
I couldn’t find any.	Tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
He has a great sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa guddaa qaba.
Everything looks mostly good.	Wanti hundi irra caalaa gaarii fakkaata.
It may be	Ta'uu danda'a .
He didn’t do any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin goone.
I am right here.	Ani sirriitti as jira.
I'm probably not being good.	Ani tarii gaarii ta'aa hin jiru.
No one else is out there.	Namni biraa ala jiru hin jiru.
They had one.	Tokko qaban turan.
I can't do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
This isn’t going to happen.	Kun hin ta’u.
I'm sure we're both clear on that.	Sana irratti lamaan keenya ifa ta'uu keenya mirkanaa'adha.
He was about him.	Inni waa'ee isaa ture.
But this is.	Garuu kun.
He even wants two.	Lama illee barbaada.
I couldn’t ask her why	Maaliif jedhee ishee gaafachuu hin dandeenye
I really want this guy.	Gurbaa kana baay'een barbaada.
That would be something new.	Sun waan haaraa ta'a.
It was people.	Namoota ture.
I'm sure you know exactly what you're doing.	Waan gootu akka gaariitti akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
I was very happy with him	Isaatti baay'een gammade
I doubt he is a very sensitive person	Nama baayyee miira qabu ta'uu isaa nan shakka
I can't do anything about that.	Sana irratti homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
He saw it, but he didn't see it	Arge malee hin argine
It is very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
That might be the right thing to do.	Sun wanta sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
That definitely helps.	Sun akka gargaaru beekamaadha.
No one has it.	Namni hin qabu.
I don't say anything.	Ani homaa hin jedhu.
These were good people.	Isaan kun namoota gaarii turan.
Just to be clear.	Ifa ta'uuf qofa.
Until he.	Hanga isa.
I thought so.	Akkas jedheen yaade.
That’s really nice.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola.
I think I would be wrong there	Achitti dogoggora ta'a jedheen yaada
Not really my favorite time of year.	Dhuguma yeroon waggaa keessaa yeroo ani baay'ee jaalladhu miti.
Better there than here.	As caalaa achitti wayya.
I like it.	Natti tola.
I knew this would happen	Kun akka ta'u nan beeka ture
But that didn’t matter.	Garuu sun homaa hin turre.
I can make it happen	Ani akka ta'u gochuu nan danda'a
Just what’s in my eyes.	Waan ija koo keessa jiru qofa.
I don’t do it.	Hin godhu.
He had a lot of money on some people	Namoota tokko tokko irratti qarshii guddaa qaba ture
I just haven’t met that one yet	Isa sana hanga ammaatti hin wal argine qofa
I want more than that.	Kana caalaa barbaada.
I want to talk to you again soon	Yeroo dhiyootti ammas sitti dubbachuu barbaada
I thought my problem was big enough.	Rakkoon koo guddaa gahaa natti fakkaate.
They didn’t understand me.	Isaan na hin hubanne.
This certainly shouldn’t be the case.	Kun ta’uu akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
But she doesn't seem to be.	Isheen garuu waan taate hin fakkaattu.
I thought you might be a problem	Rakkoo ta'uu dandeessa jedheen yaade
I think that was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture jedheen yaada.
She didn’t know what she wanted.	Waan barbaaddu hin beektu turte.
I didn’t know he was here	As akka jiru hin beeku ture
You know, she was a good home for him.	Beektaa isheen isaaf mana gaarii turte.
I didn’t know anyone in the place.	Bakka sanatti nama hin beeku ture.
He doesn’t do that here	Asitti akkas hin godhu
That is, .	Sun ...dha, .
They had many questions.	Gaaffii hedduu qaban turan.
It sounds funny now, but at the time it was pretty serious.	Amma qoosaa fakkaata, garuu yeroo sanatti baayyee hamaa ture.
I overthink everything.	Waan hundumaa garmalee nan yaada.
Not one but two cars.	Konkolaataa tokko osoo hin taane lama.
It was a huge mistake	Dogoggora guddaa ture
It is always right to do so.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas gochuun sirrii dha.
I thought you already knew this	Kana duruu waan beektu natti fakkaate
I want it, I like it.	Ani barbaada, natti tola.
But now it will be different.	Amma garuu adda ta'a.
They may still be there.	Ammas achi jiraachuu danda'u.
It was what he had.	Kan inni qabu ture.
But he did more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa hojjete.
I don't know anything about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku.
I want to know everything now	Waan hundumaa amma beekuu barbaada
We should have both known that.	Silaa lamaan keenyayyuu kana beekuu qabna turre.
I could be myself.	Ani ofii koo ta'uu danda'a.
There is no single answer to this.	Kanaaf deebii tokko hin jiru.
No one said it would be easy.	Namni salphaa ta'a jedhe hin jiru.
I didn’t know what to make of this	Kana maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I’ve always loved them	Yeroo hundumaa isaan jaalladha
There was really nothing anyone could do for him.	Dhuguma wanti namni tokko isaaf gochuu danda'u hin turre.
But I can't find it.	Garuu argachuu hin danda'u.
This seemed obvious to me.	Kun ifa natti fakkaate.
There was no one there.	Namni achi hin turre.
I didn't really think about it before now	Amma dura dhuguma waa'ee isaa hin yaadne
You really have to do it.	Dhuguma gochuu qabda.
He hadn’t spoken back	Duubatti hin dubbanne ture
I am willing to work with you	Isin waliin hojjechuuf fedhii qaba
I am absolutely thrilled	Ani guutummaatti gammadeera
I haven’t spoken to her, not right now	Ani ishee waliin hin dubbanne, yeroo ammaa miti
We have a chance.	Carraa qabna.
I knew this was my chance.	Kun carraa koo akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
This is not my father.	Kun abbaa koo miti.
Your problem.	Rakkoo keessan.
So far, so good.	Hanga ammaatti, akkas gaarii.
He had a daughter.	Intala tokko qaba ture.
Soon they would come looking for him.	Yeroo dhiyootti isa barbaadaa dhufu turan.
In many cases they were in the right place.	Haala baay'ee keessatti bakka sirrii turan.
It wasn’t completely.	Guutummaatti hin turre.
It was just what we needed	Waan nu barbaachisu qofa ture
If that were the case, he would say this.	Osoo akkas ta'ee akkas jedha ture.
He wanted to be human	Nama ta'uu barbaade
You know you will.	Akka gootu beekta.
He has a house.	Mana qaba.
Just tell us where she is.	Bakka isheen jirtu qofa nuuf himi.
But he had a reason.	Garuu sababa qaba ture.
Only three weeks.	Torban sadii qofa.
I didn’t want to see them anymore	Kana booda isaan arguu hin barbaanne
It certainly wasn’t.	Akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I know every part of you	Kutaa kee hunda nan beeka
He had her.	Ishee qaba ture.
I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
I am just like my mother.	Ani akkuma haadha kooti.
I can't tell you what's going to happen	Waan ta'uuf jiru sitti himuu hin danda'u
How can you not love that!?.	Akkamitti sana hin jaallattu!?.
I thought if I had to, I would	Ani akkas ta'uu qaba yoo ta'e nan godha jedhee yaade
I want some of this.	Kana keessaa muraasa barbaada.
I want you to know that you can have it	Akka ati qabaachuu dandeessu akka beektu nan barbaada
I really, really wanted it	Ani baay'een barbaade, baay'een barbaade
I think they say that up there	Achi ol akkas jedhu natti fakkaata
They were still together.	Ammas waliin turan.
We did a lot of things together.	Waan hedduu waliin hojjenne.
In our case	Keenya keessatti .
I wondered where he was	Eessa jira jedheen yaade
One of them left the room	Isaan keessaa tokko kutaa sana keessaa ba'e
Not much noise at all.	Sagalee baay'ee miti tasumaa.
It’s not a problem anymore.	Kana booda rakkoo miti.
Good with the old ones	Warra durii wajjin gaarii dha
I had no idea how exactly this would help them.	Kun sirriitti akkamitti akka isaan gargaaru yaada hin qabu ture.
I want to know everything you know	Waan ati beektu hunda beekuu barbaada
You can usually tell.	Yeroo baayyee beekuu dandeessa.
That’s exactly how it was	Sirriitti akkas ture
I couldn't believe it	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye
Perhaps that is a good thing.	Tarii sun waan gaarii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I didn’t really know them	Dhuguma isaan hin beeku ture
Certainly not twice in the same book.	Kitaaba tokko keessatti yeroo lama akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I really really wanted to leave him.	Ani baay'een baay'een isa dhiisuu barbaade.
But he is still wrong.	Ammas garuu dogoggora qaba.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
He almost didn't want to	Hin barbaanne jechuun ni danda'ama
So we have a few.	Kanaaf muraasa qabna.
I hope he’s gone for a long time then	Yeroo sanatti yeroo dheeraaf akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
Always so good.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas gaarii.
But they were right about the house.	Garuu waa'ee manaa sirrii turan.
I saw it, too.	Anis arge.
But he was good.	Inni garuu gaarii ture.
But it was more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa ture.
I don't understand something.	Waan tokko naaf hin galle.
I think it’s very important	Barbaachisaa ta’uu isaa baay’ee natti fakkaata
This one was completely different.	Inni kun guutummaatti adda ture.
It wants to be home.	Mana ta'uu barbaada.
But it could have been my imagination.	Garuu yaada koo ta'uu danda'a ture.
I wonder if you can give me this one	Isa kana naaf kennuu dandeessu jedheen yaada
I have a few questions	Gaaffii muraasa qaba
You can’t leave them.	Isaan dhiisuu hin dandeessu.
I just thought I should know this	Kana beekuu qaba jedheen yaade qofa
They were there.	Achi turan.
Of course, we all need money.	Hundi keenya qarshii akka nu barbaachisu beekamaadha.
I really didn’t need it	Dhuguma na hin barbaachifne
You haven’t seen me play well here in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf asitti akka gaariitti taphachuu na hin argine.
They had much in common.	Waan baayʼee wal fakkaatu qabu turan.
I was with him all day	Guyyaa guutuu isa waliin ture
That would work.	Sun ni hojjeta ture.
He did everything he had to do.	Waan gochuu qabu hunda hojjete.
Then he did it again.	Sana booda ammas godhe.
I wanted to talk about my wife	Waa'ee haadha manaa koo dubbachuu barbaade
It must be in this one.	Isa kana keessa ta'uu qaba.
This was never going to be enough.	Kun gonkumaa gahaa ta'uuf hin turre.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I’m not exactly like you	Ani sirriitti akka kee miti
I think this is it	Kun isa kana jedheen yaada
But look at it.	Garuu ilaalaa.
That they were different.	Akka isaan adda turan.
So she would have been watching.	Kanaaf silaa ilaalaa turte.
It could have been just that.	Silaa kana qofa ta'uu danda'a ture.
This is not entirely true.	Kun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
I haven’t seen you around here before	Kana dura naannoo asitti si hin argine
Much, much more.	Baay'ee baay'ee caalaa.
You don’t know how to walk in it.	Isa keessa deemuu hin beektu.
It doesn’t matter anymore	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu
The man.	Namni.
I didn’t know then	Yeroo sana hin beeku ture
I wasn’t with him for his money	Maallaqa isaaf jedhee isa waliin hin turre
That’s your chance.	Carraan keessan kanuma.
He wasn't sure if he believed her.	Ishee amanuu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
You will love it.	Ni jaallattu.
The real picture	Suuraa dhugaa
It is no longer needed.	Kana booda hin barbaachisu.
I hope it works	Akka hojjetu abdiin qaba
I think it’s going to do extremely well.	Garmalee gaarii hojjechuuf deema jedheen yaada.
I don't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu.
That wasn’t their job.	Sun hojiin isaanii hin turre.
He has a very good one	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e qaba
He hadn’t been to school.	Mana barumsaa hin deemne ture.
There is no one in there.	Nama tokkollee achi keessa hin jiru.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
We were them.	Nuti isaan turre.
I have no idea what’s in it	Waan keessa jiru yaada hin qabu
I was very familiar with this feeling	Miira kana baay'een beeka ture
I knew someone who would say that	Namni akkas jedhu nan beeka ture
It makes everything clear.	Waan hunda ifa godha.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
I just wanted to know.	Beekuu qofa barbaade.
I am the right person	Ani nama sirrii dha
It can't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin danda'u.
I couldn’t see you at all	Tasumaa si arguu hin dandeenye
I’m trying to work on that.	Sana irratti hojjechuuf yaalaa jira.
He had a lot to think about	Waan baay'ee itti yaadu qaba ture
It can be bad.	Hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
All that is needed is to make it willing.	Wanti barbaachisu fedhii akka ta'u gochuu qofa.
I was trying to make a joke	Qoosaa tokko hojjechuuf yaalaa ture
You were right this afternoon.	Har'a waaree booda sirrii turte.
I think he does a good job with them	Isaan waliin hojii gaarii hojjeta jedheen yaada
He is not there right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana achi hin jiru.
I think you have a problem	Rakkoo qabdu natti fakkaata
He must buy time first.	Dura yeroo bitachuu qaba.
Sometimes they go away.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni deemu.
I wonder why she did that	Maaliif akkas goote jedheen yaada
The less we know, the better.	Hamma xiqqoo beekne gaarii dha.
She was bright.	Isheen ifa turte.
I, first of all, think of myself	Ani, hunda dura, ofitti yaada
I can't tell him what he wants	Waan inni barbaadu himuu hin danda'u
Things don’t look so bad anytime soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti wanti akkas hamaa hin fakkaatu.
I didn't know this man	Ani nama kana hin beeku ture
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
I didn’t know then	Yeroo sana hin beeku ture
I had to do it for this opportunity	Carraa kanaaf gochuun qaba ture
I was the only one in the room	Kutaa sana keessa kan ture ana qofa ture
But most people knew.	Garuu namoonni baay'een ni beeku turan.
In the same situation.	Haala wal fakkaatu keessatti.
Not now, not here.	Amma miti, asitti miti.
I’m not sure it’s always so true.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas dhugaa ta’uu isaa mirkanaa’aa miti.
I want to know the truth	Dhugaa jiru beekuu nan barbaada
I really can't believe it	Dhuguma amanuu hin danda'u
You can have him.	Isa qabaachuu dandeessa.
It was all he intended to do.	Waan inni gochuuf yaadu qofa ture.
I didn’t know my parents	Warra koo hin beeku ture
Things seemed great at the time.	Yeroo sanatti wanti jiru waan guddaa fakkaata ture.
That's what happened.	Kan ta'e kanuma.
This was something new.	Kun waan haaraa ta’e ture.
It wasn’t easy for him.	Isaaf salphaa hin turre.
I just had to make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuu qofa ture.
I really wanted her to love me	Akka isheen na jaallattu baay'een barbaada ture
Everyone had an opinion.	Namni hundi yaada qaba ture.
I really like this one.	Isa kana baayyee natti tola.
That shouldn't have happened.	Sun ta'uu hin qabu ture.
To help you both.	Lamaan keessan gargaaruuf.
But that is not what they mean.	Kana jechuu isaanii garuu miti.
I'm glad he's mine.	Inni kan koo ta'uu isaatti gammadeera.
We don’t have enough help.	Gargaarsa gahaa hin qabnu.
Maybe we don’t have to know what to do in a situation.	Tarii haala tokko keessatti maal akka goonu beekuu hin qabnu.
Now, of course.	Amma, beekamaadha.
I have no idea what to do about that.	Waa'ee sanaa maal gochuu akka qabu yaada hin qabu.
I have more to say	Kana caalaa waanan jedhu qaba
But there is a problem.	Garuu rakkoon jira.
How's it going, my boy.	Akkamitti gurbaa koo.
You need more than that.	Kana caalaa si barbaachisa.
I know what you are.	Maal akka taate nan beeka.
I could no longer live in the house	Kana booda mana sana keessa jiraachuu hin dandeenye
They are in this together.	Kana keessa waliin jiru.
This isn’t you.	Kun ati miti.
I don’t think this is a good idea	Kun yaada gaarii natti hin fakkaatu
I want to get to know you better.	Caalaatti si beekuu barbaada.
I knew him well enough	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka ture
I know this is not easy	Kun salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
But maybe that's just me.	Garuu ta'uu danda'a sun ana qofa.
It certainly can be.	Ta’uu akka danda’u beekamaadha.
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
He was waiting for someone	Nama eegaa ture
I really hope not	Dhuguma akka hin taane abdiin qaba
Great, while staying.	Guddaa, osoo turuu.
Just helping each other.	Wal gargaaruu qofa.
There didn’t seem to be anything to say.	Wanti jedhu waan jiru hin fakkaatu ture.
In that area.	Naannoo sana keessatti.
He is making a mistake	Dogoggora hojjechaa jira
There is a time.	Yeroon jira.
He found one.	Tokko argate.
It should be completely easy.	Guutummaatti salphaa ta'uu qaba.
It doesn’t seem like a bad case.	Dhimma hamaa hin fakkaatu.
Long-term desire to give up what’s important	Fedhii yeroo dheeraa waan barbaachisaa ta’e dhiisuu
I knew this was not good	Kun gaarii akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I have nothing bad to say about it	Waa'ee isaa waan hamaa jedhu hin qabu
I have no idea if any of them are true or not	Isaan keessaa tokkollee dhugaa ta’uu fi dhiisuu isaa yaada hin qabu
I shouldn’t have told him	Silaa itti himuu hin qabu ture
Not how it doesn’t exist.	Akkamitti hin jiru miti.
Look at them!.	Isaan ilaalaa!.
I mean, good.	Gaarii jechuu kooti.
I'm going to do a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuuf deema.
But he knows it.	Garuu ni beeka.
I could be completely wrong	Guutummaatti dogoggora ta'uu nan danda'a
I'm in it.	Ani keessa jira.
I wonder what's going on.	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen yaada.
They want money.	Maallaqa barbaadu.
They are doing a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
None of this seems right.	Kun tokkollee sirrii hin fakkaatu.
I didn’t really think about it	Dhuguma itti hin yaadne
Maybe it even works.	Tarii illee ni hojjeta ta'a.
Not many answers.	Deebii baay'ee miti.
That would be a few hours.	Sun sa'aatii muraasa ta'a.
Long time, waiting.	Yeroo dheeraa, eegaa.
I can't live without them	Isaan malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
I care what he thinks	Waan inni yaadu naaf dhimma
That would be a great thing	Sun waan guddaa ta'a
It really doesn’t matter.	Dhuguma homaa hin qabu.
It has a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa qaba.
I couldn’t get the right answer	Deebii sirrii argachuu hin dandeenye
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
I doubt it very much.	Baay'een shakka.
You're not there.	Ati hin jirtu.
He's waiting for you.	Si eegaa jira.
But again, this is just my opinion.	Garuu ammas, kun yaada koo qofa.
Not something we wanted to go home to.	Waan gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaanne miti.
He seems to be doing well.	Waan gaarii hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
Didn't see him much.	Baay'ee isa hin argine.
I wonder what he was doing here	Asitti maal hojjechaa ture jedheen yaada
A couple of things though.	Waan tokko lama garuu.
Hope this helps someone else.	Kun nama biraa akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
But not anymore.	Garuu kana booda miti.
That’s all I’ve been doing my whole life	Jireenya koo guutuu kana qofa hojjechaa ture
He already had enough money	Duraan qarshii gahaa qaba ture
You didn’t know me.	Ati na hin beektu turte.
I think that's very likely	Sun baay'ee carraa guddaa qaba jedheen yaada
I couldn’t find him	Isa argachuu hin dandeenye
Maybe you don't have one.	Tarii tokko hin qabdu ta'a.
I knew something was happening	Waan tokko ta'aa akka jiru nan beeka ture
Even that is optimistic.	Sun illee abdii guddaa qaba.
I want to go with him	Isa waliin deemuu barbaada
But we didn’t, really.	Garuu nuti hin taane, dhuguma.
No one can do it.	Namni tokkollee hin danda'u.
It wasn’t on it	Irratti hin turre
I should never have come here	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture
Good.	Gaarii.
I thought so, too	Anis akkas jedheen yaada ture
Maybe you shouldn't.	Tarii gochuu hin qabdu ta'a.
I would never be alone again	Kana booda gonkumaa kophaa koo hin ta'u ture
I can't do it.	Hojjechuu hin danda'u.
I didn’t mean to tell you that, now.	Ani akkas sitti himuu hin barbaanne, amma.
You know what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru ni beekta.
I know where this is	Kun eessa akka jiru nan beeka
You know you did that.	Akkas akka goote beekta.
I know it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka.
But maybe he's on his way.	Tarii garuu karaa irra jira ta'a.
This can mean being too, too obvious.	Kun garmalee, garmalee ifa ta’uu jechuu danda’a.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
He already knew what had happened	Waan ta'e duruu beeka ture
I'm good at doing my job	Ani hojii koo hojjechuu irratti ga'umsa qaba
I think it's a good thing.	Waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
Tell her you have work to do.	Hojiin akka qabdu itti himi.
He just has it.	Inni qofa qaba.
But I could never make it home.	Garuu gonkumaa mana gochuu hin dandeenye.
But now everything was different.	Amma garuu wanti hundi adda ture.
I didn’t think through it very well	Baayyee gaarii keessa hin yaadne
Only a few times.	Yeroo muraasa qofa.
He didn't speak again.	Ammas hin dubbanne.
It not only has to be good, it has to be really good.	Gaarii ta'uu qofa osoo hin taane dhuguma gaarii ta'uu qaba.
She should have known.	Silaa beekuu qabdi turte.
Right now, though, she had a job to do.	Yeroo ammaa garuu hojii hojjechuu qabdi turte.
She was such a good girl.	Intala gaarii akkasii turte.
But they were not alone.	Garuu kophaa isaanii hin turre.
There was nothing else to do now.	Amma gochuu malee wanti biraa hin turre.
Right now I really just didn’t need that	Yeroo ammaa kana dhuguma kana qofa na hin barbaachifne
I just can't find any	Ani tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u qofa
We should never know him.	Gonkumaa isa beekuu hin qabnu.
It should be clear.	Ifa ta'uu qaba.
Just like you.	Akkuma kee.
I can tell you right now, that's wrong	Yeroo ammaa kana sitti himuu nan danda'a, sun dogoggora
We met several times after that.	Sana booda yeroo baay’ee wal argine.
He found my mother for me.	Haadha koo naaf argate.
This is very nice.	Kun baayyee namatti tola.
I wanted him a lot	Baay'een isa barbaade
I can't tell him the truth	Dhugaa jiru itti himuu hin danda'u
I have nothing to say, but it’s okay.	Waan jedhu hin qabu, garuu homaa miti.
Today is the day.	Har'a guyyaa dha.
It wasn’t there before.	Duraan hin turre.
Just like mine was.	Akkuma kan koo ture.
I had no idea what she looked like	Maal akka fakkaattu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I didn’t want to eat with them	Isaan waliin nyaachuu hin barbaanne
Completely unnecessary	Guutummaatti kan hin barbaachifne
I don't mean anything.	Homaa jechuu koo miti.
But they haven’t, yet.	Garuu hin qaban, ammallee.
I saw him a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura isa arge.
That should keep us going for a while.	Sun yeroo muraasaaf akka nu deemu qaba.
I really like his little voice.	Sagalee isaa xiqqoo baay'een jaalladha.
Do that and everything works fine.	Sana gochuun wanti hundi akka gaariitti hojjeta.
There was no one before him	Isa dura namni tokkollee hin turre
I thought she was above that sort of thing	Waan akkasii sanaa ol waan jirtu natti fakkaate
But it certainly wasn’t true.	Garuu dhugaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
It is really important to do this.	Kana gochuun dhuguma barbaachisaa dha.
I can tell you this it would not have been good.	Kana sitti himuu nan danda'a silaa gaarii hin ta'u.
I have a lot of it.	Baay'een qaba.
There were three people inside.	Namoonni sadii keessa turan.
No mistake about it.	Waa'ee isaa dogoggora hin qabu.
I can help him with that	Sana irratti isa gargaaruu nan danda'a
I'm waiting on it.	Irratti eegaa jira.
Everything was as it was.	Hundi akkuma ture.
She was great, but not that great.	Isheen guddaa turte, garuu hamma sana guddaa miti.
Lots of good stuff there	Waan gaarii baay'ee achitti
Sometimes, a big help.	Yeroo tokko tokko, gargaarsa guddaa.
It was really excellent.	Dhuguma baayyee gaarii ture.
It doesn’t even work.	Illee hin hojjetu.
He knew her mother well	Haadha ishee sirriitti beeka ture
I was here.	Ani as ture.
I can't be a father right now	Yeroo ammaa kana abbaa ta'uu hin danda'u
But now there was something he had to do.	Garuu amma wanti inni gochuu qabu tokko ture.
Sometimes during the week it just happens.	Torban keessaa yeroo tokko tokko akkas qofa ta'a.
At the door of the New Year.	Balbala bara haaraa irratti.
Not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti.
I’ve been working on this all day.	Guyyaa guutuu kana irratti hojjechaa ture.
He doesn’t do anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin hojjetu.
That’d be good.	Sun gaarii ta’a.
I think they should be.	Ta'uu qabu jedheen yaada.
You have no idea what it is.	Maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabdu.
He always wanted him	Yeroo hundumaa isa barbaada ture
I never knew it again.	Kana booda gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
There was a guy.	Gurbaa tokko ture.
I have exactly the same issue	Anis sirriitti dhimma wal fakkaatu qaba
He understood that.	Sana hubate.
It was so bad.	Akka malee hamaa ture.
I only need one pair.	Lamaan tokko qofa na barbaachisa.
I never know how to say these things	Wantoota kana akkamitti akkan jedhu gonkumaa hin beeku
I want to know if that is true	Sun dhugaa taʼuu fi dhiisuu isaa beekuu barbaada
That was always easy.	Yeroo hundumaa sun salphaa ture.
They are still doing the same thing.	Ammas kanuma ta'aa jiru.
I love making new friends	Hiriyyoota haaraa argachuu nan jaalladha
Tomorrow, of course, he will have to do his job.	Boru garuu hojii isaa hojjechuu akka qabu beekamaadha.
It was a big deal at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan guddaa ture.
He realized he wouldn't last long.	Yeroo dheeraa akka hin turre hubate.
I don’t have time to do anything	Waan tokko hojjechuuf yeroo hin qabu
She must be.	Ta'uu qabdi.
Not even his own wife knew anyone.	Haadha manaa ofii illee nama tokkollee hin beekne.
I had a lot of money	Maallaqa baay'een qaba ture
I wondered where I could have gone	Silaa eessa deemuu danda'a jedheen yaade
I never wanted to be like him.	Ani gonkumaa akka isaa ta'uu hin barbaanne.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
I was home in a matter of hours	Sa'aatii muraasa keessatti mana ture
It’s just that simple.	Akkas salphaa qofa.
I didn't know that.	Ani kana hin beeku ture.
I have a real person.	Ani nama dhugaa qaba.
It works fine so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii hojjeta.
No one is sure what to make of it.	Namni maal akka itti godhu mirkanaa'aa hin jiru.
I think we’re both in danger	Lamaan keenyayyuu balaa keessa jirra jedheen yaada
It can mean anything.	Waan hundumaa jechuu danda’a.
Nothing we haven't seen many times before.	Waan kanaan dura yeroo baay'ee hin argine hin jiru.
I didn't understand why he wanted to be with those people.	Maaliif namoota sana waliin ta'uu akka barbaadu naaf hin galle.
I enjoyed it very much	Baay'een itti gammade
Not without great danger.	Balaa guddaa malee miti.
He didn't have time.	Yeroo hin qabu ture.
This is not an accident.	Kun balaa miti.
I still think it's probably the drink	Ammallee dhugaatii sana ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada
A guy with a voice.	Gurbaa sagalee qabu.
They didn’t even have good lighting.	Ifa gaarii illee hin qaban turan.
It didn’t even have a name	Maqaa illee hin qabu ture
They were very different.	Isaan baayʼee adda turan.
I know there is more to me	Kana caalaa akka naaf jiru nan beeka
I will do everything I can against him.	Waan danda'u hunda isa irratti nan godha.
We need to know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu qabna.
That wasn’t necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa hin turre.
He wasn't saying that.	Akkas jechuu hin turre.
I said I thought you were him	Ati isa natti fakkaate jedheen ture
Now I could get help	Amma gargaarsa argachuu nan danda'a ture
You're going to be fine.	Ati gaarii ta'uuf jirta.
You can’t seem to have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu waan hin dandeenye fakkaata.
I was sure she would never tell anyone.	Isheen gonkumaa namatti akka hin himne mirkanaa'aa ture.
It’s not me.	Ana miti.
Next month it will be someone else.	Ji'a dhufu nama biraa ta'a.
He loved the girl very much.	Intala sana baayʼee jaallata ture.
I didn’t tell anyone	Ani namatti hin himne
He didn't even say anything negative about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan hamaa illee hin dubbanne.
I know all about you and your reputation.	Waa'ee kee fi maqaa gaarii kee hunda nan beeka.
I certainly thought about it.	Ani akkan itti yaade beekamaadha.
It's in a very different situation.	Haala baayyee adda ta'e keessa jira.
I need all of you this time	Yeroo kana hunda keessan barbaada
I want to know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaada.
They didn’t belong there.	Isaan kan achi hin turre.
They are working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa jiru.
It’s different from what he has.	Waan inni qabu irraa adda.
They look very real.	Baayyee dhugaa fakkaatu.
I can't answer him.	Isaaf deebii kennuu hin danda'u.
There was no one of them.	Namni isaanii hin turre.
Really good.	Gaarii dhugaa.
But, there can only be one.	Garuu, tokko qofa ta’uu danda’a.
You know you couldn’t have done that.	Silaa kana gochuu akka hin dandeenye beekta.
It was that good.	Akkasitti gaarii ture.
Everything he has to do.	Wanti inni gochuu qabu hunda.
I’ve always liked it.	Yeroo hundumaa natti tola ture.
Not sure what she needs.	Waan ishee barbaachisu mirkanaa'aa miti.
I have a vague idea of ​​where he was	Eessa akka ture yaada ifa hin taane qaba
I looked at her as she did me	Anis akkuma isheen na goote ishee ilaale
I think that was really about it	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa sun ture jedheen yaada
He knew in a moment what had happened	Waan ta'e yeroo muraasa keessatti beeka
I had no idea what was ahead of me	Waan na dura jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It may not be a car.	Konkolaataa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I could have just found her door	Silaa balbala ishee qofa argachuu danda'a ture
This is extremely dangerous.	Kun garmalee balaa qaba.
You have the will to live.	Fedhii jiraachuu qabda.
I think I can tell you a lot	Waan baay'ee sitti himuu danda'a jedheen yaada
I couldn’t do this alone.	Kana kophaa koo gochuu hin dandeenye.
I think that’s a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa natti fakkaata.
He could have done without it.	Silaa kana malee gochuu danda'a ture.
Please, just let me think.	Maaloo, akkan yaadu qofa.
It was a matter of when.	Dhimma yoom ture.
As it should be.	Akkuma ta'uu qabu.
As it should be.	Akkuma ta'uu qabu.
You're not too bad.	Ati baayyee hamaa miti.
I hope to be around them	Naannoo isaanii akkan ta'u abdiin qaba
A good man and a good father	Nama gaarii fi abbaa gaarii
I didn’t know it didn’t matter.	Ani hin beeku ture homaa hin qabu ture.
He stared at him for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ija keessa isa ilaale.
But he is having some issues.	Garuu dhimma tokko tokko qabaa jira.
I knew what he was saying	Maal akka jedhu nan beeka ture
They were always different.	Yeroo hundumaa adda adda turan.
Perhaps, this time.	Tarii, yeroo kana.
This is not your mother.	Kun haadha kee miti.
You knew he wanted to go.	Deemu akka barbaadu beekta turte.
Not that it will be easy.	Salphaa ta'a jechuu miti.
I am not in that situation	Ani haala sana keessa hin jiru
He told me he was sorry.	Dhiifama natti hime.
I wasn't doing much more	Ani baay'ee kana caalaa hojjechaa hin turre
One thing was different, it was me.	Wanti tokko adda ture, ana ture.
I still can't quite believe this is happening	Ammallee kun ta'aa jiraachuu isaa guutummaatti amanuu hin danda'u
I don't know what.	Maal hin beeku.
I don’t think that’s what you want.	Akkas waan ati barbaaddu natti hin fakkaatu.
I just need to work.	Hojjechuu qofa na barbaachisa.
I have only one answer.	Deebii tokko qofa qaba.
You know you want it.	Akka barbaaddu ni beekta.
I didn’t know where she was	Eessa akka jirtu hin beeku ture
Then he told us.	Sana booda nutti hime.
I hadn’t thought about it at all.	Homaa itti hin yaadne ture.
I can't quite do it tomorrow	Boru guutummaatti hin danda'u
It wouldn’t have helped.	Silaa hin gargaaru ture.
I didn’t do any of that right	Sana keessaa tokkollee sirriitti hin hojjenne
This wasn’t a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa hin turre.
They were alone.	Isaan kophaa turan.
But we have to do that.	Garuu akkas gochuu qabna.
Please check it out now!.	Mee amma ilaalaa!.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
It was more him than you.	Si caalaa isa ture.
I knew he would be leaving soon	Yeroo dhiyootti akka deemu nan beeka ture
All he had to do was get some food.	Wanti inni gochuu qabu nyaata tokko tokko argachuu qofa ture.
Maybe I'm the only one who likes them.	Tarii kan isaan jaallatu ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
Nobody does that today.	Har'a namni akkas godhu hin jiru.
He knew he would.	Akka godhu beeka ture.
There is one thing he cannot do.	Wanti inni gochuu hin dandeenye tokko jira.
That’s not the answer.	Sun deebii miti.
We just have to make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuu qofa qabna.
We’re the good guys here.	Nuti warra gaarii asitti.
I know more about you than you think	Waa'ee kee waan ati yaaddu caalaa nan beeka
But you have to tell me.	Garuu natti himuu qabda.
You have a way about you.	Waa'ee kee karaa qabda.
Sorry, so sorry	Dhiifama, kanaaf dhiifama
I didn’t see her.	Ani ishee hin argine.
I’m right here and I’m not leaving	Ani sirriitti as jira malee hin deemu
Like the real one.	Akka isa dhugaa.
I might say too much	Garmalee jechuu danda'a
He is still not at home.	Ammallee mana hin jiru.
I didn't want to go back inside	Keessatti deebi'uu hin barbaanne
I wanted to believe it.	Anis amanuu barbaade.
I think that’s a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
That’s a possibility.	Sun ta’uu danda’a.
I wouldn’t have gone anywhere else	Silaa bakka biraa hin deemu ture
You have to live a good life.	Jireenya gaarii jiraachuu qabda.
So for a while we both did something different.	Kanaaf yeroo muraasaaf lamaan keenyayyuu waan adda taʼe hojjenne.
I didn’t want to give up	Harka kennuu hin barbaanne
He is not at home right now	Yeroo ammaa kana mana hin jiru
I still love them	Ammallee isaan jaalladha
I can't give him any answers	Deebii tokkollee isaaf kennuu hin danda'u
It was going to be a long day.	Guyyaa dheeraa ta'uuf ture.
It seemed ridiculous.	Qoosaa fakkaata ture.
Even then, not quite.	Yeroo sanatti illee guutummaatti miti.
I need to go, to be with her	Deemuun na barbaachisa, ishee waliin ta'uuf
Nothing will ever be the same.	Wanti tokkollee yoomiyyuu wal fakkaatu hin jiru.
I saw a very large room.	Kutaa baayyee guddaa ta'e tokko arge.
I just need it for a day alone	Guyyaa kophaa ta'uuf qofa na barbaachisa
He must respond.	Deebii kennuu qaba.
I love this one and this one	Isa kanaa fi isa kana baay'een jaalladha
I thought it was a great question though.	Gaaffii guddaa natti fakkaate garuu.
I want to believe him though	Isa amanuu barbaada garuu
It's going to be a lot.	Baay'ee ta'a.
And he did it again.	Ammas godhe.
It wasn’t me anymore.	Kana booda ana hin turre.
I mean, they know each other really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti wal beeku jechuu kooti.
It takes a long time	Yeroo dheeraa barbaada
I think they will love it	Ni jaallatu jedheen yaada
He told her he wanted another one.	Kan biraa akka barbaadu itti hime.
I hope everyone at home is doing well	Namni mana jiru hundi akka gaariitti akka jiru abdiin qaba
He didn’t know how much time he had.	Yeroo meeqa akka qabu hin beeku ture.
I hope this helps someone else.	Kun nama biraa akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
It went for a long, long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf yeroo dheeraaf deeme.
It was a lot of work	Hojii baay'ee kan ture
I don’t want a job.	Hojii hin barbaadu.
You have to believe that.	Sana amanuu qabda.
They are good.	Isaan gaarii dha.
There would have been nothing.	Silaa homaa hin jiru ture.
I am not his little girl.	Ani intala isaa xiqqoo miti.
This all happened.	Kun hundi ta'e.
This wasn’t him.	Kun isa hin turre.
I began to wonder what they could be	Maal ta’uu danda’u jedheen of gaafachuu jalqabe
He knew exactly what he meant, but he didn't care	Maal jechuu akka barbaade sirriitti beeka ture, garuu homaa hin qabu ture
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
But he must have it.	Garuu qabaachuu qaba.
I thought you knew.	Ni beekta jedheen yaade.
It must be unique.	Adda ta'uu qaba.
I wasn't sure she wanted to see me again	Ammas na arguu akka barbaaddu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
That he was.	Inni akka ture.
I don't have such a problem	Rakkoo akkasii hin qabu
Your people need you right now.	Namoonni keessan yeroo ammaa kana isin barbaadu.
You can't tell what it is.	Maal akka ta'e beekuu hin dandeessu.
I think there is something in this.	Kana keessa waan jiru natti fakkaata.
What's going on.	Maaltu deemaa jira.
I certainly do.	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha.
I'm not the right person.	Ani nama sirrii miti.
Sorry for the hour	Sa'aatii kanaaf dhiifama
This is a big problem.	Kun rakkoo guddaa qaba.
She should have seen it.	Silaa arguu qabdi turte.
That was our only chance.	Carraa keenya kana qofa ture.
We had two hours.	Sa'aatii lama qabna turre.
Except that it certainly wasn’t.	Akka hin turre beekamaadha malee.
One can never know.	Namni gonkumaa beekuu hin danda'u.
I really like the car	Konkolaataa baayyee natti tola
I don't think so.	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
A couple of them even knew who she was	Isaan keessaa tokko lama eenyu akka taate illee beeku turan
I looked into his eyes	Anis ija isaa keessa ilaale
I am right with you	Ani sirriitti si waliin jira
I hadn’t done this before	Kana dura kana hin goone ture
I really didn't know what it was	Dhuguma maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
Mostly from his mother.	Irra caalaa haadha isaa irraa.
For a moment there was nothing but noise.	Yeroo muraasaaf sagalee malee wanti biraa hin turre.
Even with husband and wife.	Abbaa manaa fi haadha manaa wajjin illee akkas.
You know it's really pretty simple.	Dhuguma baayyee salphaa akka ta'e beekta.
I didn’t need them for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan hin barbaachifne
There was a time when it could have been.	Yeroon silaa ta'uu danda'u tokko ture.
She would never have.	Silaa gonkumaa hin qabdu turte.
I was looking for something	Waan tokko barbaadaa ture
I think this is just an important issue.	Kun dhimma barbaachisaa qofa natti fakkaata.
I know why it happened.	Maaliif akka ta'e nan beeka.
If it were.	Osoo ta'ee.
I want to go to them	Gara isaanii deemuun barbaada
Seeing what happens.	Waan ta'u arguu.
But this was a different case.	Garuu kun dhimma adda ture.
Where were you.	Eessa turte.
I'm not going there	Ani achi hin deemu
One of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokko.
That is certainly not the case.	Sun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I need to do this	Kana gochuun na barbaachisa
In this she was like her father.	Kana keessatti akkuma abbaa ishee turte.
I am interested in this job	Hojii kanaaf fedhii qaba
I could really make him go	Dhuguma akka inni deemu gochuu nan dandaʼa ture
I could never do that to you	Ani gonkumaa akkas si gochuu hin dandeenye
I don’t have it anymore.	Kana booda hin qabu.
We met again soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti ammas wal argine.
He said it wasn't right.	Sirrii miti jedhe.
I can only tell you what needs to be in there.	Waan achi keessa ta'uu qabu qofa sitti himuu danda'a.
But I think about it.	Ani garuu itti yaada.
It wasn’t a thing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan hin turre.
It was too soon to do that, of course.	Sana gochuuf dafee akka ture beekamaadha.
I thought he did some really good stuff	Waan dhuguma gaarii taʼe tokko tokko hojjete jedheen yaade
I think it’s just what he really needs	Dhuguma waan isa barbaachisu qofa natti fakkaata
It could have been worse, you know.	Silaa kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture, beekta.
But none of it worked.	Garuu tokkollee hin hojjenne.
Then he could not meet the demand.	Sana booda gaaffii jiru guutuu hin dandeenye.
They would have known that.	Silaa sana ni beeku turan.
I don't understand exactly	Sirriitti naaf hin galle
That’s how it should work.	Akkasitti hojjechuu qaba.
Now that would be something!.	Amma sun waan tokko ta'a!.
Always alone.	Yeroo hunda kophaa isaanii.
More likely, it’s not.	Caalaatti, akkas miti.
But now I could go back	Amma garuu duubatti deebi'uu nan danda'a ture
I'm the one at home.	Ana kan manaa.
I don't know how to do this.	Akkamitti akkan kana godhu hin beeku.
That is important to say.	Kana jechuun barbaachisaa dha.
I couldn’t leave her there	Achitti ishee dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I knew this wasn’t going to be easy.	Kun salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
I don't want to tell.	Himuu hin barbaadu.
You’re doing a good job with them.	Isaan waliin hojii gaarii hojjechaa jirta.
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I knew you weren’t going for it	Akka ati itti hin deemne nan beeka ture
I wonder what took him so long	Maaltu yeroo dheeraa itti fudhate jedheen yaada
He wasn’t looking at me.	Inni na ilaalaa hin turre.
If we didn't, it wouldn't have happened.	Osoo hin goone ta'ee hin ta'u ture.
I can't give you children	Ijoollee siif kennuu hin danda'u
Not with you.	Si waliin miti.
Still not my favorite.	Ammas kan ani jaalladhu miti.
I don't know about my favorites.	Waa'ee jaalladhu hin beeku.
We hadn’t seen each other for three long days.	Guyyaa sadii dheeraa wal hin argine turre.
I want him in there.	Achi keessa isa barbaada.
You just need to believe it.	Amanuu qofa si barbaachisa.
Man walking a small dog	Namni saree xiqqoo tokko deemaa jiru
It's very dangerous	Baay'ee balaa qaba
He never has a good answer to his question.	Gaaffii isaa kanaaf deebii gaarii gonkumaa hin qabu.
I want that to be clear.	Sana ifa ta'uu barbaada.
We are doing the work.	Hojii hojjechaa jirra.
I intend to stay here	As turuuf yaada qaba
She was very reluctant.	Baayyee fedhii hin qabdu turte.
It was never even a thought.	Yaada illee ta'ee hin beeku.
It could be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta’uu danda’a.
I still couldn’t see anyone	Ammallee nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye
It has really bad	Dhuguma hamaa qaba
He knew he could unerringly retreat.	Dogoggora malee duubatti deebi'uu akka danda'u beeka ture.
I mean, he was right	Inni sirrii ture jechuu kooti
I know that’s not easy	Sun salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
It has three parts.	Kutaa sadii qaba.
You are becoming like your mother.	Akka haadha kee ta'aa jirta.
No one wanted it as badly as they did.	Namni akka isaanii hamaa barbaade hin jiru.
I didn’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture.
She couldn’t come with him where he wanted to go.	Bakka inni deemuu barbaadu isheen isa waliin dhufuu hin dandeenye.
I had no hope of this	Kana abdii hin qabu ture
I have nothing to say	Waan himu hin qabu
Not more than that.	Kana caalaa miti.
Sometimes it is very unclear to me.	Yeroon tokko tokko baayyee naaf ifa miti.
We did the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjenne.
I, too, love the tall ones	Anis, warra dheeraa nan jaalladha
It's going very well	Baayyee gaarii ta'aa jira
I wouldn't have wanted to	Silaa hin barbaadu ture
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I want this and that.	Kanaa fi sana nan barbaada.
I didn’t need anyone	Nama tokkollee na hin barbaachifne
Everything is in place.	Wanti hundi bakka isaa jira.
I could work out	Hojii hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture
But they didn’t have it.	Garuu hin qaban turan.
We need a lot more.	Caalaatti baay'ee nu barbaachisa.
Tell, not ask.	Himuu malee gaafachuu miti.
It’s dangerous here.	Asitti balaa qaba.
Can you believe it?.	Amanuu dandeessaa?.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
She had a little time to think about it.	Yeroo xiqqoo itti yaaddu qabdi turte.
I know it will help.	Akka gargaaru nan beeka.
I wonder if you already know this	Kana duruu beektaa jedheen yaada
They are being too good.	Garmalee gaarii ta'aa jiru.
I knew he was right.	Sirrii akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
I’m still here for you	Ammallee siif as jira
I don't want to go back there tomorrow.	Boru achitti deebi'uu hin barbaadu.
It's very dangerous.	Baay'ee balaa qaba.
I knew she would	Akka isheen gootu nan beeka ture
I didn't think so	Ani akkas jedhee hin yaadne
But now he couldn't do it	Amma garuu gochuu hin dandeenye
This one didn’t.	Inni kun hin goone.
I think you should be like that	Akkas ta'uu qabda jedheen yaada
I was going to my parents	Gara warra koo deemaa ture
I obviously have an opinion	Yaada akkan qabu ifaadha
I mean, I really know someone	Dhuguma nama beeku jechuu kooti
I didn't see much after that	Sana booda waan baay'ee hin argine
He had nothing else to do.	Waan biraa hojjetu hin qabu ture.
It looked like a house.	Mana fakkaata ture.
Everything you need is here.	Wanti isin barbaachisu hundi as jira.
She wouldn’t go away.	Isheen hin deemtu turte.
Hopefully you never need that again.	Kana booda sun gonkumaa akka si hin barbaachifne abdii qabna.
I wanted time to think about it	Yeroon itti yaadu barbaade
Three were bad, one was good.	Sadii hamaa ture, tokko gaarii ture.
I thought you were	Ati natti fakkaate
But that eye.	Garuu ija sana.
I'm sure that's how you have to find him	Akkasitti isa argachuu akka qabdu mirkanaa'adha
It wasn't much but it was better than nothing.	Baay'ee hin turre garuu homaa hin taane caalaa gaarii ture.
I couldn’t do that to you	Ani akkas si gochuu hin dandeenye
So that’s how it was.	Kanaaf akkas ture.
I just have myself.	Ofii koo qofa qaba.
This was extremely important.	Kun garmalee barbaachisaa ture.
It wouldn’t work here.	Asitti hin hojjetu ture.
I don't know what this will be in the long run.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti kun maal akka ta'u hin beeku.
This was a girl.	Kun intala turte.
She certainly did.	Isheen akka goote beekamaadha.
I wanted to get feedback on that.	Sana irratti yaada argachuu barbaade.
None of them were there.	Tokkollee achi hin turre.
A very long time indeed.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa dhuguma.
So that doesn’t work.	Kanaaf sun hin hojjetu.
I knew what he wanted.	Waan inni barbaadu nan beeka ture.
It was never a mistake.	Gonkumaa dogoggora hin turre.
No one would have thought it possible.	Silaa namni ni danda'ama jedhee yaadu hin jiru.
I wanted to do a good job	Hojii gaarii hojjechuu nan barbaada ture
I knew he would do that	Akkas akka godhu nan beeka ture
I was here two days	Guyyaa lama as ture
I don’t have to.	Dirqama hin qabu.
This never really happened.	Kun dhuguma ta’ee hin beeku.
Three in one year.	Waggaa tokko keessatti sadii.
Not that there was much time to eat.	Yeroon nyaachuu baay'ee ture jechuu miti.
I mean, we were just new friends	Hiriyyoota haaraa qofa turre jechuu kooti
I mean, really, who else is there	Dhuguma eenyutu biraa jira jechuu kooti
Maybe it's different for you.	Tarii siif adda ta'uu danda'a.
She was such a great girl.	Intala guddaa akkasii turte.
I could see the truth in everything	Waan hundumaa keessatti dhugaa arguu nan dandaʼa ture
This was such a meal.	Kun nyaata akkasii ture.
I can't tell him what he did	Waan inni godhe itti himuu hin danda'u
It's never happened before.	Kanaan dura ta'ee hin beeku.
He's waiting for me.	Na eegaa jira.
I can't say enough good things about them	Waa'ee isaanii waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
Maybe even too much.	Tarii garmalee illee ta'uu danda'a.
I can't eat anymore.	Kana booda nyaachuu hin danda'u.
He was important.	Inni barbaachisaa ture.
He didn’t have any money	Maallaqa tokkollee hin qabu ture
You may meet some.	Tokko tokko waliin wal arguu dandeessa.
I hadn’t noticed it before	Kanaan dura hin hubanne ture
I never thought that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas jedhee hin yaadne.
I'm so glad to see you	Si arguu kootti baay'een gammade
She wasn't sure if she saw us	Nu arguu fi dhiisuu ishee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Something in him is not right.	Wanti isa keessa jiru tokko sirrii miti.
I shouldn't know this	Ani kana beekuu hin qabu
I am very excited to work with her again.	Ammas ishee waliin hojjechuuf baayyee gammadeera.
I haven’t seen anyone do this yet so I did.	Ani hanga ammaatti nama kana godhu hin argine kanaaf nan godhe.
I don't know if that's true anymore	Kana booda sun dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku
This is the guy.	Gurbaa kana.
I was trying to help you	Si gargaaruuf yaalaa ture
It was clear what was happening now.	Waan amma ta'aa jiru ifa ture.
I probably could.	Ani tarii nan dandaʼa ture.
He was helpless to do anything else	Waan biraa hojjechuuf gargaarsa hin qabu ture
I’ve always been so happy.	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti gammadeera.
Better than some of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko tokko caalaa gaarii dha.
It’s right in the name.	Maqaa keessa sirriitti jira.
Not that it was so early.	Akkas dafee ture jechuu miti.
I didn't even know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture.
There is no hope.	Abdiin hin jiru.
He had to give up everything.	Waan hundumaa dhiisuu qaba ture.
I know you love me now	Amma akka na jaallattu nan beeka
He used to eat for his food	Duraan nyaata isaaf nyaata ture
I hope it will be	Akka ta'u abdiin qaba
But I haven't told him yet	Hanga ammaatti garuu itti hin himne
I think that’s a great idea.	Sun yaada guddaa natti fakkaata.
You can tell me your way about what happened.	Waan ta'e karaa kee natti himuu dandeessa.
I thought there were two of you	Isin lama waan jirtu natti fakkaate
I didn’t know she had a dog	Saree akka qabdu hin beeku ture
I like it a little bit	Xiqqoo natti tola
He couldn't help me.	Na gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
It could have been better.	Silaa kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
They still had a few hours.	Ammallee sa'aatii muraasa qaban turan.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
Just one thought.	Yaada tokko qofa.
I wanted to be a father to you	Siif abbaa ta'uu barbaade
There was nothing at all	Homaa tokkollee hin turre
You need them.	Isaan si barbaachisa.
He wasn’t the only one.	Inni qofa hin turre.
She was dangerous.	Isheen balaa qabdi turte.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin hojjenne.
Someone else has to do that.	Namni biraa akkas gochuu qaba.
I can’t do that, I couldn’t.	Ani akkas gochuu hin danda’u, hin danda’u ture.
I could ask you around	Naannoo siif gaafachuu nan danda'a ture
Sorry, but too often.	Dhiifama, garuu yeroo baay'ee.
I knew if we went something would happen	Yoo deemne waan tokko akka ta'u nan beeka ture
I can’t seem to think	Yaadu waanan hin dandeenye fakkaata
I mean, it’s not necessary	Barbaachisaa miti jechuu kooti
I couldn’t do anything.	Waan tokko hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
I'm sure she didn't say it	Isheen akka hin dubbanne mirkanaa'adha
He seemed to have missed everything around him.	Waan naannoo isaa jiru hunda waan darbe fakkaata ture.
They’re not kidding a bit.	Xiqqoo hin qoosaa jiru.
I couldn't have done it without her	Ishee malee kana gochuu hin danda'u ture
What could be the problem ?.	Rakkoon maal ta'uu danda'a ?.
I want to know how this happened	Kun akkamitti akka ta'e beekuu barbaada
To stay, sometimes you need something.	Turuuf yeroo tokko tokko waan tokko si barbaachisa.
I don't have to go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
It’s a bit dangerous.	Xiqqoo balaa qaba.
I want the good and the bad.	Gaarii fi hamaa nan barbaada.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
But we are the reality.	Garuu nuti dhugaa jiru.
But I didn't understand much.	Garuu waan baay'ee hin hubanne.
You might get lucky there.	Achitti carraa argachuu dandeessa.
He has something to say	Waan jedhu qaba
This obviously doesn’t work.	Kun akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
Then we knew a lot.	Sana booda waan baay'ee beekne.
I don't know anything.	Ani homaa hin beeku.
I am going to be a father	Ani abbaa ta'uuf deema
I passed the house that night	Halkan sana mana sana bira darbe
I would never think of you that way	Ani gonkumaa akkas sitti hin yaadu ture
It used to be you once	Duraan yeroo tokko si ture
I didn't know how to tell him what had happened	Waan ta'e akkamitti akkan itti himu hin beeku ture
You can’t do any better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
She didn't know when that would happen.	Yoom akkas ta'u hin beektu turte.
No one knows him.	Namni isa beeku hin jiru.
This language is important.	Afaan kun barbaachisaa dha.
Who doesn’t.	Kan hin goone.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammadeera.
There was a reason we were together.	Sababni waliin turre tokko ture.
I know these are bad times	Yeroon kun yeroo hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka
I was both of those people	Ani namoota sana lamaan ture
That was who she was, what she did.	Eenyu akka taate, maal akka goote kanuma ture.
We have a picture together.	Suuraa waliin qabna.
That's kind of what's happening here.	Asitti waan ta'aa jiru akkasii.
Maybe it's something else.	Tarii waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
But we have to go back to what was before.	Garuu waan kanaan dura ture irratti duubatti deebi'uu qabna.
I can't tell you other than that	Kana malee sitti himuu hin danda'u
I have no problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoo hin qabu.
You never know what he might say.	Maal jechuu akka dandaʼu gonkumaa hin beektu.
I don’t want anyone else to know	Namni biraa akka beeku hin barbaadu
I could be there with them.	Isaan waliin achi jiraachuu nan dandaʼa ture.
She was the one who knew.	Kan beektu isheen ture.
I didn't tell him anything.	Homaa itti hin himne.
I think you might be right	Sirrii ta'uu dandeessa jedheen yaada
They shouldn't be any problem.	Rakkoo tokkollee ta'uu hin qaban.
This is your business.	Kun dhimma keessan.
Maybe just one person.	Tarii nama tokko qofa.
But it is possible.	Garuu ni danda'ama.
She didn't know.	Isheen hin beekne.
Maybe even better.	Tarii kana caalaa gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
I haven’t seen him in a couple of weeks	Torban lama lama booda isa hin argine
I didn’t know he had it in him.	Isa keessa akka qabu hin beeku ture.
I think that’s just right	Sun sirrii qofa jedheen yaada
How much work would that be.	Sun hojii meeqa ta'a.
So many people want to know what you know now.	Kanaaf namoonni baay'een waan ati amma beektu beekuu barbaadu.
I still can't believe she did that	Ammallee akkas akka goote amanuu hin danda'u
He has no father.	Abbaa hin qabu.
But that’s not enough.	Garuu sun gahaa miti.
I think they were doing that to mine	Kan koo irratti akkas gochaa turan jedheen yaada
I can't do that, you know.	Ani akkas gochuu hin danda'u beekta.
That is not the case here.	Asitti akkas miti.
I like everything about you	Waa'ee kee waan hundumaa natti tola
I think they were waiting for us	Isaan nu eegaa turan natti fakkaata
If you really don’t want to.	Yoo dhuguma hin barbaanne.
More things like that.	Wantoota akkasii caalaa.
A girl perhaps.	Intala tokko tarii.
But she doesn’t have to.	Garuu isheen dirqama miti.
I told her she didn’t need that.	Sana akka ishee hin barbaachifne itti hime.
I used to love her so much	Duraan baay'een ishee jaalladha
Then there was two.	Sana booda lama ture.
The worst of the worst.	Hamaa keessaa isa hamaa.
No one even knows your name.	Maqaa kee illee namni beeku hin jiru.
I couldn't believe how much time had passed	Yeroon baay'een akka darbe amanuu hin dandeenye
But it's not very vocal.	Garuu baayyee sagalee hin qabu.
She hadn’t thought of that.	Isheen akkas hin yaadne turte.
I knew nothing better than you	Si caalaa homaa hin beeku ture
Very likely.	Baay'ee hin oolu.
You are not wrong.	Ati dogoggora miti.
Such a simple thing.	Waan salphaa akkasii.
When no one else is watching.	Yeroo namni biraa ilaalaa hin jirre.
I couldn’t ask anyone to help me.	Nama akka na gargaaru gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
Something I haven’t seen before.	Waan kanaan dura hin argine.
That wasn’t entirely clear to me.	Sun guutummaatti naaf ifa hin turre.
So they can exist.	Kanaaf jiraachuu danda'u.
This is one of my suggestions.	Kun yaada koo keessaa tokko.
He came through very clearly.	Inni baayyee ifa ta'ee keessa darbe.
I know you know something	Waan tokko akka beektu nan beeka
It was nothing without her	Ishee malee homaa hin turre
I could have known her better, really	Silaa caalaatti ishee beekuu danda'a, dhuguma
Boy, was he right.	Gurbaa, sirrii turee.
I couldn’t help the guy	Gurbaa sana gargaaruu hin dandeenye
Not everyone did it.	Namni hundi hin goone.
I think he should come with me.	Na waliin dhufuu qaba jedheen yaada.
I thought he was here	Inni as jira jedheen yaade
I will definitely do that	Ani akkas gochuun koo hin oolu
I knew this was true.	Kun dhugaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
I just want to know why you did that	Maaliif akkas goote qofa beekuu barbaada
Little things like that	Waan xiqqoo akkasii
I wasn’t that kind of guy	Ani gurbaa akkasii hin turre
He knew about that.	Waa'ee sanaa ni beeka ture.
I’m not the only one who does it all the time.	Yeroo hunda kan hojjetu ana qofa miti.
But that can't be that simple.	Garuu sun hangas salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I know he is wrong.	Dogoggora akka qabu nan beeka.
It says who can come and who can go.	Eenyu dhufuu danda'a eenyutu deemuu danda'a jedha.
You knew them both.	Isaan lamaan beekta turte.
Lots of kids, lots of people.	Ijoollee baay'ee, namoota baay'ee.
I know you know better than that.	Kana caalaa akka ati beektu nan beeka.
He wasn’t here.	Inni as hin turre.
I want to eat something	Waan tokko nyaachuu barbaada
I know you don't understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e akka siif hin galle nan beeka.
We were just there.	Nuti achi qofa turre.
I don’t think they’re right for me.	Isaan naaf sirrii natti hin fakkaatu.
I love her so much	Baay'een ishee jaalladha
I'm not much.	Ani baay'ee miti.
I didn’t want to see it anymore.	Kana booda arguu hin barbaanne.
I just looked around	Anis naannoo koo qofa ilaale
I couldn’t leave him	Isa dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I just want to know what happened	Waan ta'e qofa beekuu barbaada
Sometimes it doesn’t even come to us.	Yeroo tokko tokko illee nutti hin dhufu.
That just wasn’t going to happen in this job.	Hojii kana keessatti sun ta’uuf hin turre qofa ture.
But this was even better.	Garuu kun kana caalaa gaarii ture.
But maybe even that would be an overstatement.	Garuu tarii sun illee garmalee dubbachuu ta'a.
Mostly me.	Irra caalaa ana.
It's just us.	Nu qofa.
He wants more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa barbaada
Even the money.	Maallaqa illee.
So much for that.	Kanaaf baay'ee.
Having someone.	Nama qabaachuu.
It doesn’t work any better.	Kana caalaa hin hojjetu.
You were there.	Ati achi turte.
I can't do it to them	Isaan irratti gochuu hin danda'u
I really have to go.	Dhuguma deemuun qaba.
Sometimes it was just too much.	Yeroo tokko tokko garmalee ta'uu qofa ture.
Not much like him.	Akka isaa baay'ee miti.
But never the same parents.	Garuu gonkumaa warra tokko.
He is no longer in that position	Kana booda bakka sana hin jiru
Perhaps she was right.	Tarii sirrii jettee turte taʼa.
Lots of questions answered.	Gaaffii baay'een deebii argate.
I didn't want to ask	Gaafachuu hin barbaanne
I wanted my husband and kids.	Abbaa manaa koo fi ijoollee koo nan barbaada ture.
This is not good.	Kun gaarii miti.
He started walking towards her.	Gara ishee deemuu jalqabe.
I'm not in this mood today	Har'a miira kana keessa hin jiru
I had no one to help me, either.	Anis nama na gargaaru hin qabu ture,
I didn’t want to live anywhere else	Bakka biraa jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I wanted to be just as lucky	Anis akkuma carraa ta'uu barbaade
I loved her so much	Baay'een ishee jaalladha ture
He shouldn’t have.	Inni qabaachuu hin qabu ture.
I didn't know that about you	Waa'ee kee akkas hin beeku ture
I wouldn't have thought much of it	Silaa baay'ee itti hin yaadu ture
He hadn’t seen that coming.	Inni sun dhufuu isaa hin argine ture.
I want to do something important	Waan barbaachisaa taʼe tokko hojjechuu nan barbaada
Someone has to do it.	Namni tokko hojjechuu qaba.
I don’t need that.	Sana na hin barbaachisu.
I didn't see anything	Ani homaa hin argine
I didn’t really mean it	Dhuguma jechuu koo hin turre
I don’t say it.	Hin jedhu.
I knew he didn’t know	Akka hin beekne nan beeka ture
It’s just that you don’t know right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana hin beektu jechuu qofa.
I can't make it work	Akka hojjetu gochuu hin danda'u
This has never been the case.	Kun akkasitti ta'ee hin beeku.
So therein lies the problem.	Kanaaf rakkoon jiru achi keessa jira.
I was just one person.	Ani nama tokko qofa ture.
You don’t need to do anything.	Homaa gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
It’s not like we talked.	Akka waan dubbanne miti.
I wondered why.	Maaliif jedheen yaade.
I can't say who.	Eenyu jechuu hin danda'u.
That’s my father.	Sun abbaa kooti.
I told him a drink would be fine	Dhugaatii tokko gaarii akka ta'u itti hime
But she was right.	Garuu isheen sirrii turte.
I wasn’t around for him.	Ani isaaf naannoo hin turre.
I was here with my friends	Hiriyyoota koo waliin as ture
I didn't know you.	Ani si hin beekne ture.
He was wrong in this.	Kana keessatti dogoggora ture.
I can do it tomorrow	Boru gochuu nan danda'a
I know there was no one else around	Naannoo sanatti namni biraa akka hin turre nan beeka
But this is different.	Garuu kun adda.
It will never make you anything else.	Yoomiyyuu waan biraa si hin godhu.
I never want to quit	Gonkumaa dhiisuu hin barbaadu
And I did it, too.	Anis nan godhe.
There must be a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni jiraachuu qaba.
It's not me, though.	Ana miti garuu.
Everyone who works there.	Namni achitti hojjetu hunda.
You can't make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuu hin dandeessu.
It has a clock.	Sa'aatii qaba.
I knew you would forgive me	Dhiifama akka naaf gootu nan beeka ture
It must be her.	Ishee ta'uu qaba.
He may be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I didn’t want to do any of it	Ani tokkollee gochuu hin barbaanne
Three times it happened.	Yeroo sadii akkas ta'e.
She didn't mean it.	Jechuun ishee hin turre.
I hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
Who do you think it is.	Eenyu jettanii yaaddu.
The problem was, it just wasn’t entirely true.	Rakkoon ture, guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre qofa ture.
I really want them.	Dhuguma isaan barbaada.
Not so, absolutely.	Akkas miti, guutummaatti.
They make excuses.	Isaan sababa ni godhu.
But it often seems like the problem is today.	Garuu yeroo baay’ee rakkoon har’a keessa jiru fakkaata.
They are not the same.	Isaan tokko miti.
I love my father very much	Abbaa koo baay'een jaalladha
I am absolutely thrilled	Ani guutummaatti gammadeera
It was like that with parents like her.	Warra akka ishee waliin akkas ture.
I didn’t want to go with them	Isaan waliin deemuu hin barbaanne
He should be left alone	Kophaa isaa dhiisuu qaba
I want to know the answer to this question	Gaaffii kanaaf deebii isaa beekuu barbaada
I now know what that means	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe amma beeka
It is really necessary.	Dhuguma barbaachisa.
So, he did it.	Kanaaf, ni godhe.
The wife's thoughts.	Yaada haadha manaa.
You might think it's not so bad.	Akkas hamaa miti jettanii yaaddu ta'a.
I think it exists now.	Amma waan jiru natti fakkaata.
A simple thing in the big picture, perhaps.	Suuraa guddaa keessatti waan salphaa, tarii.
There’s just a chance.	Carraan qofa jira.
Look at it now.	Amma itti ilaalaa.
But, what was is still there.	Garuu, wanti ture ammallee jira.
It doesn’t mean.	Jechuu miti.
He is here now.	Inni amma as jira.
Maybe it's forgiveness.	Tarii dhiifama ta'uu danda'a.
But she was the only one.	Garuu ishee qofa turte.
This is not without risk.	Kun balaa malee miti.
There was really only one thing he needed to know.	Dhuguma wanti inni beekuu qabu tokko qofa ture.
But someone else did.	Garuu namni biraa akkas godhe.
He told me about the problems in my life.	Rakkoo jireenya koo keessatti natti hime.
Not that it could never happen.	Yoomiyyuu ta'uu hin danda'u jechuu miti.
I don’t want you to do it.	Akka ati gootu hin barbaadu.
It takes two people	Nama lama barbaada
Everyone said that.	Namni hundi akkas jedhe.
After me of course!.	Ana booda beekamaadha!.
Maybe she should tell someone what was going on.	Tarii waan ta'aa ture namatti himuu qabdi ta'a.
I don't have to know.	Beekuu hin qabu.
I don't mean anything	Ani homaa jechuu koo miti
I mean your parents.	Warra keessan jechuu kooti.
Those seem certain.	Isaan sun waan mirkanaa'aa ta'e fakkaata.
He could have done it.	Silaa gochuu danda'a ture.
Something was better than nothing.	Waan tokko homaa hin taane caalaa gaarii ture.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
I can't live with them	Isaan waliin jiraachuu hin danda'u
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
It works well in mine.	Kan koo keessatti akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Tomorrow, he thought.	Boru jedhee yaade.
It makes something else clear.	Waan biraa ifa godha.
It wants to be something	Waan tokko ta'uu barbaada
Everything is new here.	Asitti wanti hundi haaraa dha.
Older people like to see them there.	Namoonni umuriin isaanii guddaa taʼe achitti isaan arguu ni jaallatu.
I have work for him tomorrow	Boru hojiin isaaf qaba
It’s a guy.	Gurbaa dha.
There was plenty of time then.	Yeroo sanatti yeroon baay'ee ture.
He is a human being.	Inni nama.
Then who knows.	Sana booda eenyutu beeka.
I can see everything	Waan hundumaa arguu nan danda'a
Which they have.	Kan isaan qaban.
I must have my whole life ahead of me	Jireenya koo guutuu na dura qabaachuu qaba
Sometimes saying sorry isn’t enough.	Yeroo tokko tokko dhiifama jechuun gahaa miti.
It must already be in you.	Duraan si keessa jiraachuu qaba.
I didn’t know any of them	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin beekne
It probably should have happened.	Silaa ta'uu qaba ture ta'uu hin oolu.
I should have told you	Silaa sitti himuu qaba ture
I really hope not	Dhuguma akka hin taane abdiin qaba
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
I want him, so very much	Ani isa barbaada, kanaaf baay'ee baay'ee
I think that's what you said	Kan ati jette akkas natti fakkaata
Something she really didn’t understand.	Waan dhuguma isheen hin hubanne.
That was different.	Sun adda ture.
I’m not a good person	Ani nama gaarii hin taane
I think he loves you	Inni akka si jaallatu natti fakkaata
It was a life.	Jireenya ture.
He has to do another one	Kan biraa hojjechuu qaba
Just our opinion though.	Yaada keenya qofa garuu.
I think it will happen this week.	Torban kana ni ta'a jedheen yaada.
I don't mean it to be	Akkas ta'uuf jechuu koo miti
He had his two children with him.	Ijoollee isaa lamaan of biraa qaba ture.
I have no idea what he’s going to do	Waan inni gochuuf deemu yaada tokkollee hin qabu
I have no idea how he got them	Akkamitti akka isaan argate yaada hin qabu
They were the ones who had.	Kan qaban turan.
She’s not the only one.	Ishee qofa miti.
I didn’t want to do any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee gochuu hin barbaanne.
From time to time before.	Yeroo yeroon dura.
I didn’t talk to her.	Ani ishee waliin hin dubbanne.
I want to do my best	Waan danda'u hunda gochuu nan barbaada
We are doing what he tells us to do.	Waan inni nutti himu hojjechaa jirra.
I thought it was mine to do them	Isaan hojjechuuf kan koo natti fakkaate
I couldn’t do this alone	Kana kophaa koo gochuu hin dandeenye
I think it would be a great, great thing	Waan guddaa, guddaa ta'a jedheen yaada
Not with her, not with anyone.	Ishee waliin miti, eenyu waliin miti.
It's good together.	Waliin gaarii dha.
But it happens soon.	Garuu dafee ta'a.
Great man, great man	Nama guddaa, nama guddaa
But I couldn’t see them.	Garuu isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
He didn’t want her to know he knew she was watching him.	Isa ilaalaa akka jirtu akka beeku akka isheen beektu hin barbaanne.
I didn't want to talk about them	Waa'ee isaanii dubbachuu hin barbaanne
Someone else made it happen .	Namni biraa akkas akka ta'u godhe .
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Three and three.	Sadii fi sadii.
You can see what you think.	Waan yaaddu arguu dandeessa.
That is exactly what is needed.	Wanti barbaachisu sirriitti kanuma.
I know this is different	Kun adda akka ta'e nan beeka
I might work on one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko irratti hojjechuu danda'a
We were both of us.	Lamaan keenyayyuu turre.
I thought it was going well	Akka gaariitti deemaa jira jedheen yaade
I had time to make this work	Kana akka hojjetu gochuuf yeroon qaba ture
No one was happy.	Namni gammade hin jiru.
But that’s him.	Garuu sun isa.
I haven’t been up here in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf as ol hin turre.
But they have to be.	Garuu isaan ta'uu qabu.
He was the most important.	Inni hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ture.
I’ve been like that my whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu akkas ture.
I have no idea where she is	Eessa akka jirtu yaada hin qabu
I can't believe they haven't noticed that for so long	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas akka hin hubanne amanuu hin danda'u
I think it went well	Akka gaariitti deeme natti fakkaata
He wasn’t even on duty.	Dirqama irra illee hin turre ture.
It started.	Jalqabe.
I will be yours, yours alone.	Ani kan kee ta'a, kan kee qofa ta'a.
I was sure there was more	Kana caalaa akka jiru mirkanaa'aa ture
She needs to know that.	Sana beekuu qabdi.
Please, it's a must.	Maaloo, dirqama.
No one saw that coming.	Namni sun dhufuu isaa arge hin jiru.
They must be doing something.	Waan tokko hojjechaa jiraachuu qabu.
But how.	Garuu akkamitti.
This is my opinion.	Kun yaada kooti.
We still have the same eyes.	Ammas ija wal fakkaatu qabna.
They don’t have kids together	Ijoollee waliin hin qaban
He said he loved me	Nama na jaalladha jedhe
Living in one place that.	Bakka tokko jiraachuu kan.
We went the way.	Karaa deemne.
It was inside him, this voice.	Keessa isaa ture, sagalee kana.
They have their time.	Yeroo isaanii qabu.
When you think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu.
He knew everything.	Waan hundumaa beeka ture.
New.	Haaraa.
please.	maaloo.
That way you can see what you have.	Akkasitti waan qabdu arguu dandeessa.
But of course she does.	Garuu akkas akka gootu beekamaadha.
I had such high hopes for you	Abdii guddaa akkasii siif qaba ture
I can't live without you anymore	Kana booda si malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
I could no longer answer his name.	Kana booda maqaa isaaf deebii kennuu hin dandeenye.
One of them must be her.	Isaan keessaa tokko ishee ta'uu qaba.
He is in her territory.	Inni naannoo ishee keessa jira.
I don't even know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
A tall man with long arms.	Nama dheeraa harka dheeraa qabu.
That was kind of a disaster.	Sun akka balaa guddaa ture.
That’s not my idea of ​​a good time.	Sun yaada koo yeroo gaarii miti.
I love you that much	Hamma sana si jaalladha
I can see that in you	Sana si keessatti arguu nan danda'a
I didn't know about it	Waa'ee isaa hin beeku ture
It was something in me.	Waan na keessa ture.
He had little interest though.	Fedhii xiqqoo qaba ture garuu.
Now I’m doing even better	Amma kana caalaa hojjechaa jira
But of course it could be worse.	Garuu kana caalaa hamaa ta’uu akka danda’u beekamaadha.
There is no need for that.	Sana hin barbaachisu.
This, however, took time.	Kun garuu yeroo fudhate.
But there was a problem.	Garuu rakkoon ture.
But this isn’t how it works.	Garuu kun akkasitti hin hojjetu.
I told him he was out	Anis akka inni ba'e itti hime
I think it doesn’t matter	Homaa hin qabu jedheen yaada
I can't believe you'd do that	Akkas akka gootu amanuu hin danda'u
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
I still couldn’t see it.	Ammallee arguu hin dandeenye.
You know what’s coming.	Waan dhufu beekta.
No one knew better.	Kana caalaa namni beeku hin turre.
We did that one.	Isa sana hojjenne.
I was completely and utterly alone	Guutummaatti fi guutummaatti kophaa koo ture
I saw the picture.	Suuraa sana arge.
She didn’t know they did that anymore.	Kana booda akkas gochuu isaanii hin beektu turte.
This is what happened now.	Amma ta'e kana.
We are always looking for them.	Yeroo hundumaa isaan barbaadaa jirra.
It wasn’t always easy.	Yeroo hundumaa salphaa hin turre.
I know you’re there	Achi akka jirtu nan beeka
No one else is me.	Namni biraa ana hin jiru.
He had a new life.	Jireenya haaraa qaba ture.
I can't stay out of her for long	Yeroo dheeraa ishee ala turuu hin danda'u
I wasn’t expecting this.	Kana eegaa hin turre.
I had my eye on it then.	Yeroo sanatti ija koo qaba ture.
I can never get back with him	Yoomiyyuu isa waliin deebi'uu hin danda'u
I still can't tell you anything else	Ammallee waan biraa sitti himuu hin danda'u
While all of this is not the same situation, it works well.	Kun hundi haala tokko osoo hin taane, akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I didn’t know them	Ani isaan hin beekne
This doesn't work.	Kun hin hojjetu.
I needed it tonight	Halkan kana na barbaachisa ture
We have two work items.	Wantoota hojii lama qabna.
But.	Garuu.
He wanted to stay indoors	Mana keessa turuu barbaade
Just working together.	Waliin hojjechuu qofa.
He said it would never be anything.	Gonkumaa homaa hin ta'u jedhe.
It seemed like a pretty good idea at the time.	Yeroo sanatti yaada baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
I want to work on my house	Mana koo irratti hojjechuu nan barbaada
He may be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
It doesn’t matter.	Dhimma hin qabu.
I have a waiting car.	Konkolaataa eegaa jiru qaba.
I really just couldn’t do it without help.	Dhuguma gargaarsa malee gochuu qofa hin dandeenye.
They are my parents.	Isaan warra kooti.
They still do that.	Ammas akkas godhu.
This was no easy task	Kun hojii salphaa hin turre
I didn’t want to see him	Isa arguu hin barbaanne
What she did was wrong.	Wanti isheen goote dogoggora ture.
I doubt you ever will	Ati gonkumaa akka hin goone nan shakka
But this is not my opinion.	Kun garuu yaada koo miti.
Nothing much, really.	Waan baay'ee hin jiru, dhuguma.
I knew he didn't care about me	Waa'ee koo akka hin yaadne nan beeka ture
He probably would have	Silaa qabaachuu hin oolu
He still had questions to ask.	Ammallee gaaffii gaafachuu qabu qaba ture.
He’s just all his emotions.	Inni miira isaa hunda qofa.
I just can't do that	Ani akkas gochuu qofa hin danda'u
It was just his feelings.	Miira isaa qofa ture.
I know why he did that.	Maaliif akkas akka godhe nan beeka.
Reason is no longer reason.	Sababni kana booda sababa miti.
Unless you do that.	Yoo akkas goote malee.
She had to come.	Isheen dhufuu qabdi turte.
I had no real idea where	Eessa akka ta'e yaada dhugaa hin qabu ture
Many people come looking for him	Namoonni baay'een isa barbaadaa dhufu
I need some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
He realized that no one had tried this	Namni kana yaale akka hin jirre hubate
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
A lot can happen in three months	Ji'a sadii keessatti waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a
You could be on to something.	Waan tokko irratti ta'uu dandeessa.
Not sure what people were expecting.	Namoonni maal akka eegaa turan mirkanaa'aa miti.
I can find another way to help	Karaa biraa itti gargaaru argachuu nan dandaʼa
She wouldn’t have been able to believe it.	Silaa amanuu hin dandeessu turte.
It really should work.	Dhuguma hojjechuu qaba.
They needed food.	Nyaata isaan barbaachisa ture.
No one is around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin jiru.
He wants something.	Waan tokko barbaada.
I wondered what had happened	Maaltu ta'e jedheen yaade
We still have a lot to offer.	Ammas waan baay'ee qabna.
Just living in the night.	Halkan keessa jiraachuu qofa.
I could do very well here	Asitti baayyee gaarii hojjechuu nan danda'a ture
We have them from that time, you know.	Yeroo sanaa irraa isaan qabna, beekta.
That never happened.	Sun gonkumaa hin taane.
It's not like it happens every day.	Akka guyyaa hunda ta'u miti.
I didn’t know what to think anymore	Kana booda maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture
I looked right into his eyes.	Anis sirriitti ija isaa keessa ilaale.
Now you have me.	Amma na qabda.
It’s very dangerous.	Baayyee balaa qaba.
But this was important.	Garuu kun waan barbaachisaa ture.
They’re not bad.	Isaan hamaa miti.
It wasn’t bad, it was really good.	Hamaa hin turre, dhuguma gaarii ture.
I hope that you, don’t want them.	Akka ati, akka isaan hin barbaanne abdiin qaba.
I didn't think about it	Ani itti hin yaadne
No one seemed to notice.	Namni waan hubate hin fakkaatu ture.
You’re doing your job.	Hojii kee hojjechaa jirta.
I saw what he was doing.	Waan inni hojjechaa jiru arge.
This may be true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
He wants it, you know.	Inni barbaada, beekta.
Probably like this morning.	Tarii akkuma ganama kana.
They are no longer children.	Kana booda ijoollee miti.
The whole door.	Balbala guutuu.
I like this episode.	Kutaa kana natti tola.
I can't live without it	Isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
Maybe it never will.	Tarii gonkumaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I just hadn’t noticed how time had passed	Yeroon akkamitti akka darbe qofa hin hubanne ture
He did all of that.	Sana hunda godhe.
I wouldn't have wanted to know.	Silaa beekuu hin barbaadu ture.
It worked for us	Nuuf hojjete
Not now, not ever.	Amma miti, yoomiyyuu miti.
I knew we could do this	Kana hojjechuu akka dandeenyu nan beeka ture
I didn’t see them.	Isaan hin argine.
That could have been really bad.	Sun dhuguma hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
I needed him as much as he needed me	Anis akkuma inni na barbaadu isa barbaada ture
I wanted to, too.	Anis barbaade.
But he couldn't.	Hin dandeenye malee.
Someone was out there.	Namni tokko achi ala ture.
I shouldn’t be here.	Ani as jiraachuu hin qabu.
I will say nothing more	Kana caalaa homaa hin jedhu
I went with him, too.	Anis isa waliin deeme.
It was working well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa ture.
I looked so different	Ani baay'ee adda fakkaata ture
It's going to be a long night.	Halkan dheeraa ta'uuf jira.
But that may be easier said than done.	Garuu sun dubbachuu caalaa gochuu caalaa salphaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I wouldn't have done it otherwise.	Osoo akkas ta'ee hin godhu ture.
Maybe he thought it was his.	Tarii kan isaa itti fakkaate ta'a.
But not entirely.	Garuu guutummaatti miti.
That would work.	Sun ni hojjeta ture.
Now I know what to do	Amma maal akkan godhu beeka
They have money.	Maallaqa qabu.
He always knew what had happened, what would happen	Yeroo hundumaa waan ta'e, maal akka ta'u beeka ture
No one else needs to know.	Namni biraa beekuu hin barbaachisu.
It’s really no big deal.	Dhuguma waan guddaa miti.
I really just want to get to know you	Dhuguma si beekuu qofa barbaada
It has what you want	Waan ati barbaaddu qaba
Look at me.	Na ilaalaa.
I shouldn't have returned it to you	Silaa siif deebi'uu hin qabu ture
I just made it happen	Ani akka ta'u qofa godhe
I was outside with him when it happened	Yeroo ta'u isa waliin ala ture
All we have to do is find it.	Wanti nuti gochuu qabnu argachuu qofa.
Working hours.	Yeroo hojii.
But he wanted to.	Garuu barbaade.
It wouldn't be easy.	Waan salphaa hin ta'u ture.
I just need to see her	Ishee arguu qofa na barbaachisa
He had to admit he was lucky	Carraa akka qabu amanuu qaba ture
It wasn't something like we have today.	Waan akka har'a qabnu hin turre.
And I was working for him.	Anis isaaf hojjechaa ture.
It came from nothing.	Homaa irraa dhufe hin jiru.
He wouldn’t come to her.	Gara ishee hin dhufu ture.
It doesn’t go away for long	Yeroo dheeraa hin deemu
Maybe it was me.	Tarii ana ta'uu hin oolu.
But only a little bit.	Garuu xiqqoo qofa.
But we won’t, in this case.	Garuu hin goonu, haala kana keessatti.
I knew something wasn’t right	Waan tokko sirrii akka hin taane nan beeka ture
See where that goes.	Sun eessa akka deemu ilaalaa.
But that’s the only reason.	Garuu sababni isaa kana qofa.
But then, it was just great.	Garuu sana booda, guddaa qofa ture.
I can't sleep anymore.	Kana booda hirriba hin danda'u.
Not yet, but soon.	Ammallee miti, garuu yeroo dhiyootti.
Again, nothing happened.	Ammas homaa hin taane.
I love that name	Maqaa sana baay'een jaalladha
I don't know what to say	Waan jedhu hin beeku
So he wasn’t going to help.	Kanaaf gargaaruuf hin turre.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
If he knew about it, he didn't care.	Yoo waa'ee isaa beeka ta'e dhimma hin qabu ture.
I want to find the real thing	Waan dhugaa ta'e argachuu barbaada
He has enough work.	Hojii gahaa qaba.
I couldn’t meet him	Isa waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye
I need some help with this	Kana irratti gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa
I knew then that the time was right.	Yeroo sanatti yeroon isaa sirrii akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
He should have done this.	Silaa kana gochuu qaba ture.
But she had to see her mother.	Garuu haadha ishee arguu qabdi turte.
Perhaps another time.	Tarii yeroo biraa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I'm sure he did.	Akka godhe mirkanaa'adha.
I don't know what to do	Waan godhu hin beeku
He would be everything we needed.	Inni waan nu barbaachisu hunda ta'a ture.
He was my idea.	Inni yaada koo ture.
You have to have feelings.	Miira qabaachuu qabda.
It's going to be great.	Guddaa ta'a.
I don't want to know anything	Waan tokko beekuu hin barbaadu
He had to help himself.	Of gargaaruu qaba ture.
But he was.	Inni garuu ture.
No one wants to think that way	Namni akkas yaadu hin barbaadu
He was a different person before.	Nama duraan adda ta'e ture.
I really love it here	Asitti dhuguma baay'een jaalladha
It couldn't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I want it to be good	Gaarii akka ta'u nan barbaada
But he has no chance.	Garuu carraa hin qabu.
I almost didn't want to believe what he was saying	Waan inni jedhu amanuu hin barbaanne jechuun ni danda'ama
It wasn’t even his job.	Hojii isaa illee hin turre.
A life similar to yours.	Jireenya jireenya kee wajjin wal fakkaatu.
It still exists.	Ammas jira.
But nothing seemed problematic.	Garuu wanti rakkoo qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
We hope it helps you.	Akka isin gargaaru abdii qabna.
I have nothing bad to say.	Waan hamaa jedhu hin qabu.
I love everything about it	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa nan jaalladha
He didn't know how that was possible, but he knew.	Akkamitti sun ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku ture, garuu ni beeka ture.
I still don’t know what she looks like.	Maal akka fakkaattu ammallee hin beeku.
and he will not go again.	ammas hin deemu.
I couldn't see much, but it was enough	Baay'ee arguu hin dandeenye, garuu gahaa ture
What was it and what happened.	Maal ture maaltu ta'e.
I wasn’t any better	Ani kana caalaa hin turre
I want you to get to know him.	Akka ati isa beektu nan barbaada.
I was very wrong.	Baay'een dogoggora ture.
I didn't want to talk about it	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne
Maybe he was just in a bad mood.	Tarii miira hamaa keessa qofa ture ta'a.
It has no place in your life anymore.	Kana booda jireenya kee keessatti bakka hin qabu.
I think he’s trying	Inni yaalaa jira jedheen yaada
They need to be said.	Isaan jechuu barbaachisa.
This, however, did not happen.	Kun garuu hin taane.
I probably did not do that	Ani akkas hin goone taʼa
It was playing.	Taphachuu ture.
There wasn't much in it that I could see.	Wanti baay'ee arguu danda'u keessa hin turre.
No one thought it was possible.	Namni ni danda'ama jedhee yaade hin jiru.
It may not be what anyone else likes but that's not important.	Waan namni biraa jaallatu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a garuu sun barbaachisaa miti.
I didn't think so	Akkasitti hin yaadne
I was working on mine last week.	Torban darbe kan koo irratti hojjechaa ture.
We hope you don’t need anything else.	Kana malee homaa akka isin hin barbaachifne abdii qabna.
I may not give him a chance	Carraa isaaf kennuu dhiisuu danda'a
Lots of noise.	Sagalee baay'ee.
I don't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu.
It couldn't be too late.	Yeroon booda ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I couldn't do this	Waan kana gochuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t know what to do with you	Maal akkan si godhu hin beeku ture
Not a good idea, but not a disaster.	Yaada gaarii miti, garuu balaa miti.
I think you will soon know	Yeroo dhiyootti ni beektu jedheen yaada
It was for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ture.
I was the only one who knew it was coming	Akka dhufu kan beeku ana qofa ture
We were good enough	Gaarii gahaa turre
I don’t have a job anymore	Kana booda hojii hin qabu
I looked at my father	Abbaa koo ilaale
When she.	Yeroo isheen.
I never thought it would be obvious.	Ifa ta'a jedhee hin beeku.
I don’t think he even looked at them.	Illee waan isaan ilaale natti hin fakkaatu.
Their only hope.	Abdii isaanii qofa.
We did everything.	Waan hunda hojjenne.
I thought of my parents	Warra kootti yaade
I have pictures with a lot of people	Namoota baay'ee waliin suuraa qaba
I think he was true to his feelings	Miira isaatiin dhugaa ture jedheen yaada
But she had a husband.	Garuu abbaa manaa qabdi turte.
He isn’t.	Inni miti.
I hope you don’t see me	Akka na hin argine abdiin qaba
I didn’t like being around people	Namoota bira jiraachuu hin jaalladhu ture
Work.	Hojii.
He was my father.	Inni abbaa koo ture.
They are doing it.	Gochaa jiru.
I was happy with myself.	Ofitti gammadeera.
In one whole year.	Waggaa tokko guutuu keessatti.
Everything will be fine.	Hundi gaarii ta'a.
I don't understand that.	Sana naaf hin galle.
He thought about it.	Itti yaade.
But that couldn't happen.	Garuu sun ta'uu hin dandeenye.
Maybe it's time now.	Tarii yeroon isaa amma ta'uu danda'a.
Those are just a few.	Isaan sun muraasa qofa.
I was so happy to get back to it	Itti deebi'uu kootti baay'een gammade
What works for me, works for me.	Wanti naaf hojjetu, naaf hojjeta.
I'm going to be myself	Ani ofii koo ta'uuf deema
It didn’t do very well.	Baayyee gaarii hin hojjenne.
I was glad he didn’t go	Inni akka hin deemne nan gammade
We are here to help!.	Gargaaruuf as jirra!.
He may say something important.	Waan barbaachisaa taʼe tokko dubbachuu dandaʼa.
I couldn't stay here long	Yeroo dheeraa as jiraachuu hin danda'u ture
Tell them what we saw here.	Waan asitti argine itti himi.
But maybe it could do better.	Garuu tarii kana caalaa hojjechuu danda'a.
I never tell anyone.	Ani gonkumaa namatti hin himu.
Maybe it never will.	Tarii gonkumaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It seems to work.	Waan hojjetu fakkaata.
More than we can say.	Kan jechuu dandeenyu caalaa.
Maybe you did, but maybe you didn't.	Tarii ati goote ta'a, tarii garuu hin goone ta'a.
I saw your mother there	Haadha kee achitti arge
I knew her and she was always nice	Ani ishee beeka ture yeroo hunda namatti tola turte
He liked to say that he was.	Akkas ta'uu isaa dubbachuu ni jaallata ture.
I didn't think it would be a problem	Rakkoo ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
I’m not going to do anything.	Ani homaa gochuuf hin deemu.
I could have been a teacher	Barsiisaa ta'uu nan danda'a ture
They don’t have all the answers.	Deebii hunda hin qaban.
This is probably not what you want.	Kun tarii waan ati barbaaddu miti.
This is my own.	Kun kan kooti.
I know you’re trying	Akka ati yaalaa jirtu nan beeka
It made him special.	Adda isa godhe.
He said he wouldn't have done well there.	Silaa achitti gaarii hin ta'u jedhe.
Not one little bit.	Xiqqoo tokkollee miti.
This was not always the case	Yeroo hundumaa kun akkas hin turre
I'm sure it's okay to say	Jechuun homaa akka hin taane mirkanaa'adha
I can ask them later	Booda isaan gaafachuu nan danda'a
But not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf garuu miti.
Only children.	Ijoollee qofa.
It all seemed to happen in a matter of moments.	Kun hundi yeroo muraasa keessatti waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
He wasn’t the only one.	Inni qofa hin turre.
That’s nothing new.	Sun waan haaraa miti.
I thought nothing of it, of course	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne, beekamaadha
No one else would have told me that.	Silaa namni biraa akkas natti himu hin jiru.
You have to believe in yourself.	Ofitti amanuu qabda.
I was trying not to think about it	Ani akkan itti hin yaadne yaalaa ture
They are on the road.	Karaa irra jiru.
You didn’t want anything from him.	Ati homaa irraa hin barbaanne.
I didn't think that was possible	Akkas ta'uu danda'a jedhee hin yaadne
I couldn’t see what he was doing	Waan inni hojjetu arguu hin dandeenye
That’s my feeling here.	Asitti miira koo kanuma.
Right now you are.	Yeroo ammaa kana ati.
This was a very serious situation.	Kun haala baayyee hamaa ture.
Silly.	Salphaa.
We wanted to do it.	Hojjechuu barbaanne.
You really don’t know anything yet.	Dhuguma hanga ammaatti homaa hin beektu.
The right one.	Kan sirrii ta'e.
It was nothing new.	Waan haaraa hin turre.
Can someone help me please.	Namni tokko na gargaaruu danda'a maaloo.
But we never do.	Garuu gonkumaa hin goonu.
He’s just so ridiculous.	Inni akkasitti qoosaa qofa.
He shouldn't have one.	Tokko qabaachuu hin qabu.
He is now there.	Inni amma jira.
He is right.	Inni sirrii dha.
I knew him better now.	Amma caalaatti isa beeka ture.
We still had no money.	Ammas qarshii hin qabnu turre.
He is with me.	Inni na waliin jira.
She will be gone for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin jirtu.
I really wanted you to love me	Ani akka ati na jaallattu baay'een barbaade
Not everyone is like you.	Namni hundi akka kee miti.
I didn't know much about him	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beeku ture
That's very different.	Sun baayyee adda.
I really want that kind of feeling	Miira akkasii baay'een barbaada
I have to go further.	Kana caalaa deemuun qaba.
Repeat after me.	Ana booda irra deebi'i.
Something is really wrong.	Dhuguma wanti tokko dogoggora.
I would never have thought of it that way	Silaa gonkumaa akkasitti hin yaadu ture
That ever went away.	Sun yoomiyyuu deeme.
I couldn’t see them.	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
That works well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I didn’t know what else to do	Kana booda maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
Really, just a little bit.	Dhuguma, xiqqoo qofa.
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii.
I didn’t know you could get it like that	Akkasitti argachuu akka dandeessu hin beeku ture
I will never know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku.
But it doesn't do anything.	Garuu homaa hin godhu.
Now they have to be.	Amma isaan ta'uu qabu.
Who knows what will happen.	Waan ta'u eenyutu beeka.
Not with you.	Si waliin miti.
He really should have earned this.	Dhuguma kana argachuu qaba ture.
But it really isn’t.	Garuu dhuguma akkas miti.
I have no idea whatsoever	Ani yaada tokkollee hin qabu
Boy, he can do it.	Gurbaa, ni danda'a.
Now I say look at this car.	Amma konkolaataa kana ilaalaa jedha.
He wants to see you, this is where you are.	Inni si arguu barbaada, bakka ati jirtu kana.
Nothing happens ahead of time.	Yeroon dura wanti ta'u hin jiru.
That was something we really had to work on.	Sun waan dhuguma irratti hojjechuu qabnu ture.
But certainly not all.	Garuu hunda akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It looks good now.	Amma gaarii fakkaata.
It’s certainly not just one thing.	Waan tokko qofa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It's working very well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjechaa jira.
I have the same feeling	Anis miira wal fakkaatu qaba
That’s really nice.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola.
It was a disaster.	Balaa ture.
There is no problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoon hin jiru.
He should have known this would happen	Silaa kun akka ta'u beekuu qaba ture
There are some things we need to work on.	Wantoota tokko tokko irratti hojjechuu qabnu jiru.
I thought to myself.	jedheen ofitti yaade.
Look at him.	Isa ilaalaa.
I told him all about you	Waa'ee kee hunda itti hime
Probably not a good thing.	Tarii waan gaarii miti.
I wasn't sure who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
I still don't know.	Ammallee hin beeku.
I have no idea why he thinks that	Maaliif akkas akka yaadu yaada hin qabu
He would have walked on.	Silaa irra deema ture.
I mean, I said.	jedheen jechuu kooti.
I didn’t talk to anyone	Nama tokkollee waliin hin dubbanne
I started to back away.	Anis duubatti deebi'uu jalqabe.
You can never go away.	Yoomiyyuu deemuu hin dandeessu.
I still wasn't sure about it	Ammallee waa'ee isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I think he was a child	Ijoollee ture jedheen yaada
Didn't do anything, really.	Homaa hin hojjenne, dhuguma.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Ani garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
I can't leave anything out	Waan tokko dhiisuu hin danda'u
You know you can do it.	Akka dandeessu ni beekta.
Of course, this was not always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas akka hin turre beekamaadha.
Within an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko keessatti.
Just too many of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee qofa.
That, he didn’t.	Kana, hin goone.
Everyone was just human.	Namni hundi nama qofa ture.
I didn't really care in those days.	Bara sanatti baayʼee dhimma hin qabu ture.
We just knew it was the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ta'uu qofa beekne.
This is obviously incorrect.	Kun sirrii akka hin taane ifaadha.
Look at them.	Isaan ilaalaa.
I can't believe you would do that to me	Akkas na gootu jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
That we really were.	Dhuguma akka turre.
But people are different.	Garuu namoonni adda.
You know what you know.	Waan beektu ni beekta.
I just wasn’t in the mood right now	Yeroo ammaa kana miira keessa hin turre qofa
I didn’t think so a while ago.	Yeroo xiqqoo dura akkas hin yaadne.
That’s not all, though.	Kana qofa miti garuu.
That’s not their job.	Sun hojii isaanii miti.
Look up at them.	Isaan ol ilaalaa.
Two to go.	Lama deemuuf.
I thought about it more this morning	Ganama kana caalaatti itti yaade
But he was right.	Garuu sirrii ture.
Mine isn’t that bad.	Kan koo hangas hamaa miti.
But we never do.	Garuu gonkumaa hin goonu.
But he says he won't come.	Garuu hin dhufu jedha.
This is new.	Kun haaraa dha.
But they are there for us.	Garuu isaan nuuf jiru.
A very big picture thing indeed.	Waan suuraa baayyee guddaa ta'e dhuguma.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
I really didn't even know why	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture
But not for the most part.	Garuu irra caalaa miti.
Today is not your day.	Har'a guyyaa keessan miti.
He always knew he was coming to this.	Yeroo hundumaa gara kanaa akka dhufu beeka ture.
Nothing can help you here.	Wanti asitti si gargaaruu danda'u hin jiru.
I wish this had happened a long time ago	Osoo kun yeroo dheeraa dura ta'ee natti tola
She’s not an accident.	Isheen balaa miti.
I still barely knew him	Ammallee baayʼee isa hin beeku ture
So something is wrong.	Kanaaf wanti tokko dogoggora.
But he still knows who he is.	Garuu ammallee eenyu akka ta'e ni beeka.
What’s going to happen? 	Maaltu taʼa?
You know how to be alone.	Akkamitti kophaa ta'uu akka qabdu ni beekta.
That was all it was.	Kana qofa ture.
Not in her eyes.	Ija ishee keessatti miti.
I didn’t know these people	Namoota kana hin beeku ture
I need a good night’s sleep	Hirriba gaarii na barbaachisa
She wouldn't have known.	Silaa hin beektu turte.
He never knew he was coming around	Inni yoomiyyuu naannoo isaa dhufuu isaa hin beeku ture
I went to my father	Abbaa koo bira deeme
I know the date, the time.	Guyyaa, sa'aatii nan beeka.
My whole life.	Jireenya koo guutuu.
This is just such a situation.	Kun haala akkasii qofa.
I sure hope so.	Akkas abdiin qaba jedheen mirkanaa'adha.
I knew she was more than that	Isheen kana caalaa akka taate nan beeka ture
I didn’t want to give it a chance	Carraa itti kennuu hin barbaanne
I didn't think about it	Anis itti hin yaadne
I think he’s someone everyone should know.	Nama namni hundi beekuu qabu natti fakkaata.
Except for two things.	Waan lama malee.
I just can't leave her here	Asitti ishee dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u
He didn’t want to see her again.	Ammas ishee arguu hin barbaanne.
It seems like it could happen.	Ta'uu waan danda'u fakkaata.
I know it very well	Ani akka gaariitti beeka
He was a good one.	Inni gaarii ture.
I thought you would love it	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaade
He wants you.	Inni si barbaada.
Maybe this is a mistake.	Tarii kun dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
It's not just that.	Kan qofa miti.
Then we have that.	Sana booda sana qabna.
This is not right, that is not right.	Kun sirrii miti, sun sirrii miti.
It just seemed to work.	Waan hojjetu qofa fakkaata ture.
All those promises.	Waadaa sana hunda.
I can't do any better	Kana caalaa hojjechuu hin danda'u
She just didn't know who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e qofa hin beektu turte.
I didn't even know why	Maaliif akka ta'e illee hin beeku ture
Not one of them.	Tokkollee miti.
I have never seen a book like this	Kitaaba akka kanaa hin argine
I definitely still do	Ammallee akkan godhu beekamaadha
I mean, it was a lot.	Baay'ee ture jechuu kooti.
Just look at them.	Isaan qofa ilaalaa.
Perhaps he was not in real danger.	Tarii balaa dhugaa keessa hin turre taʼa.
He had someone to do all of that	Nama waan kana hunda hojjetu qaba ture
But I hadn't spoken	Ani garuu hin dubbanne ture
I was me, not me.	Ani ana ture malee ana hin turre.
I could not find the error.	Dogoggora sana argachuu hin dandeenye.
I wanted to tell you then	Yeroo sana sitti himuu barbaade
I had my children.	Ijoollee koo qaba ture.
He should have had it before	Kana dura qabaachuu qaba ture
In one lifetime.	Jireenya tokko keessatti.
She has to speak again.	Dubbachuu qabdi ammas.
I looked around.	Anis naannoo koo ilaale.
I need some help here.	Asitti gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
Maybe I'll just go home	Tarii gara manaatti qofa deebi'uu danda'a
It would have been nice	Silaa gaarii ture
Now, tell me about her.	Amma, waa'ee ishee natti himi.
I am not at home most of the time.	Yeroo baayʼee mana koo hin jiru.
I couldn’t even see anything	Homaa illee arguu hin dandeenye
He did it on his own.	Ofii isaatiin hojjete.
We still have it.	Ammallee qabna.
It should never have come.	Silaa gonkumaa dhufuu hin qabu ture.
I’m always watching.	Yeroo hundumaa ilaalaa jira.
Nothing special about that.	Sana keessatti wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
I'm not coming from here	Ani as irraa hin dhufu
I wondered what he wanted	Maal barbaada jedheen yaade
We’ve always been together.	Yeroo hundumaa waliin turre.
They want you to love them.	Akka ati isaan jaallattu barbaadu.
I didn’t think she even knew him	Isheen illee waan isa beektu natti hin fakkaatu ture
He wanted what he wanted	Waan inni barbaadu barbaade
It has to come from within.	Keessaa dhufuu qaba.
Now it's quick.	Amma dafee.
He knows where you are.	Bakka jirtu ni beeka.
I was a great wife for a very long time	Ani yeroo baayyee dheeraaf haadha manaa guddaa ture
I wanted to do something different.	Waan adda taʼe hojjechuu nan barbaade.
It was a good night.	Halkan sun gaarii ture.
It may not be the case.	Ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Really seeing.	Dhuguma arguu.
I have been there, twice	Ani achi tureera, yeroo lama
That’s why it exists.	Kanaaf jira.
I could find you then	Yeroo sanatti si argachuu nan danda'a ture
As such, the opportunity for feedback was greater in this context.	Akka kanaan carraan yaada kennuu haala kana keessatti guddaa ture.
I didn’t realize it was so late	Akkasitti yeroon booda dhufuu isaa hin hubanne
No one was outside of this.	Namni kanaan ala hin turre.
I wanted to be up there with them	Isaan waliin achi ol ta'uu barbaade
If you're here, if you're in the room, you need it.	Yoo as jirta ta'e yoo kutaa keessa jirta ta'e si barbaachisa.
I think that’s what he wants.	Kan inni barbaadu kana natti fakkaata.
I know what you’re thinking.	Waan ati yaaddu nan beeka.
None of that happens here	Sana keessaa tokkollee asitti hin ta'u
Two years ago.	Waggaa lama dura.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
He knows exactly what he gave us.	Waan nuuf kenne sirriitti beeka.
He should have stayed	Silaa turuu qaba ture
I don't have anyone who loves me	Nama na jaallatu hin qabu
It will happen, one day.	Ta'a, guyyaa tokko.
This was a good idea.	Kun yaada gaarii ture.
I can't stay here any longer.	Kana booda as turuu hin danda'u.
He didn't tell me.	Natti hin himne.
He wants to eat you	Si nyaachuu barbaada
Nobody did that anymore.	Kana booda namni akkas godhe hin jiru.
She of course, is right.	Isheen beekamaadha, sirrii dha.
I still have a favor for you	Ammallee tola siif qaba
I knew that at the time	Yeroo sanatti akkas nan beeka ture
Lots of people coming and going.	Namoonni dhufuu fi deemu baay'ee.
I am completely with you	Guutummaatti isin waliin jira
I don’t know how you can do that.	Akkamitti akkas gochuu akka dandeessu hin beeku.
I had no idea what to do	Maal akkan godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I don’t have it.	Hin qabu.
I want to do something a little different	Waan xiqqoo adda ta'e hojjechuu barbaada
What happened today should not have happened.	Wanti har'a ta'e ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I'll go in your place	Ani bakka kee nan deema
It doesn't seem like that now.	Amma akkas hin fakkaatu.
We were just about playing.	Waa'ee taphachuu qofa turre.
I wanted to do something right	Waan tokko sirriitti hojjechuu nan barbaade
He was new here.	Asitti haaraa ture.
I can't believe it's you	Si ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
They all have it.	Hundi isaanii qabu.
I couldn’t believe she knew me like that	Akkasitti akka na beektu amanuu hin dandeenye
It was a very dangerous environment.	Naannoo baayyee balaa qabu ture.
I said it was very good.	Anis baayyee gaarii dha jedheen.
He was a great time.	Inni yeroo guddaa ture.
It was a new life.	Jireenya haaraa ture.
You know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e ni beekta.
It wasn’t just in this situation.	Haala kana qofa keessatti hin turre.
She never does.	Isheen gonkumaa hin gootu.
I have nothing to say about any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee waanan jedhu hin qabu.
You need work to do that.	Kana gochuuf hojii si barbaachisa.
I knew it was just a moment	Yeroo muraasa qofa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
I’m not going to go for it.	Ani itti hin deemu.
I can't believe you did this	Kana goote jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I mean, you're human	Ati nama jechuu kooti
I can't tell anyone but you	Si malee namatti himuu hin danda'u
Sorry not enough time.	Dhiifama yeroo gahaa miti.
It doesn't have a sound.	Sagalee hin qabu.
I won't do it now.	Amma hin godhu.
I didn't think anything else about it	Waa'ee kanaa waan biraa hin yaadne
A little goes a very long way	Xiqqoo karaa baayyee dheeraa deema
He had a chance.	Carraa qaba ture.
Nothing really happened there.	Dhuguma achitti wanti ta'e hin jiru.
It is very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
All he asked for was money.	Wanti inni gaafate qarshii qofa ture.
It's not much different.	Baay'ee adda miti.
It's going to be.	Kan ta'u ta'a.
But, it seemed important she knew, now.	Garuu, barbaachisaa fakkaata ture isheen beektu, amma.
I really need my sleep	Hirriba koo baay'ee na barbaachisa
I think she’s right.	Isheen sirrii natti fakkaata.
I had no issues with that.	Sana irratti dhimma tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Except it's just me.	Ana qofa yoo ta'e malee.
This doesn't seem right.	Kun sirrii hin fakkaatu.
I haven’t really seen anyone here yet	Dhuguma hanga ammaatti nama tokkollee asitti hin argine
No need, really.	Hin barbaachisu, dhuguma.
He hadn’t done that in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas hin goone ture.
This time there was none of that.	Yeroo kana sun tokkollee hin turre.
I mean, almost nowhere	Bakka hin jirre jechuun ni danda'ama jechuu kooti
I didn't mean for this to happen.	Kun akka ta'uuf hin yaadne.
I have absolutely no idea	Ani tasumaa yaada hin qabu
I want to live life here with you	Jireenya asitti si waliin jiraachuu barbaada
After such a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa akkasii booda.
I didn’t want to see him anymore	Kana booda isa arguu hin barbaanne
You your work there, me here with mine.	Ati hojii kee achitti, ana kan koo waliin asitti.
Their job is not easy.	Hojiin isaanii salphaa miti.
A man of truth.	Nama dhugaa qabu.
I think we should stay here if we can	Yoo dandeenye as turuu qabna jedheen yaada
I always thought it was just me	Yeroo hundumaa ana qofa jedheen yaada ture
No more without shoes	Kana booda kophee malee hin ta'u
He had a lot of questions	Gaaffii baay'ee qaba ture
But still more can happen in a year.	Garuu ammas caalaa waggaa tokko keessatti waan baay'een ta'uu danda'a.
Which in itself is no easy task.	Kan ofuma isaatiin hojii salphaa hin taane.
That’s what it was.	Kanuma ture.
I know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
He thought he looked good.	Inni gaarii fakkaata jedhee yaade.
I have no idea why.	Maaliif jedhee yaada hin qabu.
I am pretty new to this area.	Ani naannoo kanaaf baayyee haaraa dha.
It can't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin danda'u.
I want to tell you what happened.	Waan ta'e himuu barbaada.
I just can't believe this	Kana qofa amanuu hin danda'u
To make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuuf.
In the light.	Ifa keessatti.
I want answers, real	Deebii barbaada, dhugaa
A girl with no problems in life	Intala jireenya keessatti rakkoo hin qabne
I could never ever get enough of this	Kana gonkumaa gonkumaa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye
I don't quite understand why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti naaf hin galle.
But we had to do it.	Garuu gochuu qabna turre.
I’m going to stay with the guys	Ani gurbaa bira turuuf deema
She was right there.	Isheen sirriitti turte.
Which could be tomorrow.	Kan boru ta'uu danda'u.
But not much is clear.	Garuu waan baay'een ifa hin taane.
But then, of course she did.	Garuu sana booda, akka goote beekamaadha.
In this case it was home.	Haala kana keessatti mana ture.
I had never seen any of these people before	Namoota kana keessaa tokkollee kanaan dura hin argine ture
It's not bad.	Hamaa mitii.
I know you love her more than me	Ana caalaa ishee akka jaallattu nan beeka
Not that I can ask.	Gaafachuu danda'a jechuu miti.
I have no idea where that time went.	Yeroon sun eessa akka deeme yaada hin qabu.
I can't find my mistakes.	Dogoggora koo argachuu hin danda'u.
Still like me	Ammallee akkuma ana
Nothing else should matter.	Wanti biraa dhimma qabaachuu hin qabu.
I wouldn’t have thought of that	Silaa akkas hin yaadu ture
I have no idea if it happened or not.	Ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa yaada hin qabu.
I didn’t want that kind of life	Jireenya akkasii hin barbaadu ture
If you want that, it won’t help you	Yoo akkas barbaaddu si hin gargaaru
Not everyone can do that.	Namni hundi akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
I think you need someone to find you	Nama si barbaadu si barbaachisa jedheen yaada
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
A month, maybe longer	Ji'a tokko, tarii kana caalaa dheeraa ta'uu danda'a
I should never have gone with him	Silaa gonkumaa isa waliin deemuu hin qabu ture
I can tell you this here	Kana asitti sitti himuu nan danda'a
He was absolutely great.	Inni guutummaatti guddaa ture.
Maybe it's true but we can't say the real reason.	Tarii dhugaa ta'uu danda'a garuu sababa dhugaa dubbachuu hin dandeenyu.
No help, nothing	Gargaarsa hin qabu, homaa hin qabu
But not his food.	Garuu nyaata isaa miti.
A very good day.	Guyyaa baayyee gaarii.
I was glad he did.	Kana gochuu isaatiin gammadeera.
Everything was outside.	Wanti hundi ala ture.
I have to go to her.	Gara ishee deemuun qaba.
As it was.	Akkuma ture.
I could have done without it.	Silaa kana malee gochuu nan danda'a ture.
I looked over at my new dog	Anis saree koo haaraa sana bira ilaale
But it does.	Garuu ni godha.
But this is me.	Garuu kun ana.
It might just work.	Tarii hojjechuu qofa danda'a.
He didn’t have it though.	Hin qabu ture malee.
He knows us so well.	Inni akka malee nu beeka.
It used to be, he thought.	Duraan ture jedhee yaade.
He seemed extremely happy to see me.	Na arguu isaatiin garmalee waan gammade fakkaata ture.
No one can really help.	Dhuguma namni gargaaruu danda'u hin jiru.
But that wasn’t it.	Garuu sun hin turre.
You have to help me here.	Asitti na gargaaruu qabda.
It was never really me.	Dhuguma ana ta'ee hin beeku.
You have a great day tomorrow.	Boru guyyaa guddaa qabda.
He has.	Inni qaba.
None of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
I can't do this without you	Si malee kana gochuu hin danda'u
I have been watching you both for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isin lamaan ilaalaa tureera.
It does your job.	Hojii kee hojjeta.
I don’t know if he knows that.	Kana beekuu isaa hin beeku.
I don’t like this place	Bakka kana hin jaalladhu
This one was very similar.	Inni kun baayyee wal fakkaata ture.
He quickly realized that was the case.	Akkas ta'uu isaa dafee hubate.
I wasn’t there.	Ani hin turre.
I didn’t think anything of it	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne
I told him everything.	Waan hundumaa itti hime.
Look at that money.	Maallaqa sana ilaalaa.
Very, very much.	Baay'ee baay'ee.
I know you love it	Akka jaallattu nan beeka
How everyone is doing the same thing	Akkamitti namni hundi waan tokko hojjechaa jiru
I can't do this anymore.	Kana booda kana gochuu hin danda'u.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I certainly can’t find any right now	Yeroo ammaa kana tokkollee argachuu akkan hin dandeenye beekamaadha
He'll be fine, of course.	Inni gaarii ta'a, beekamaadha.
I was extremely good at this though	Ani garuu kana irratti garmalee gaarii ture
They make it seem real.	Dhugaa akka fakkaatu godhu.
I didn’t do this for you	Ani kana siif hin goone
I really have no idea why you do that	Dhuguma maaliif akkas gootu yaada hin qabu
I didn’t realize he was there waiting for me	Achitti na eegaa akka jiru hin hubanne
I think I really like it	Dhuguma natti tola jedheen yaada
I couldn’t even help myself	Of gargaaruu illee hin dandeenye
I didn’t really understand how that worked	Sun akkamitti akka hojjetu dhuguma hin hubanne
Maybe that's how it should be.	Tarii akkas ta'uu qaba.
I always think about you	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee kee nan yaada
Just two or three really good ones.	Lama sadii qofa dhuguma gaarii.
Which is not the case.	Kan hin taane.
Nothing similar now.	Amma homaa wal fakkaatu hin jiru.
I don't want to have to do it again.	Ammas gochuun dirqama ta'uu hin barbaadu.
A man devoted to his duty	Nama dirqama isaaf of kenne
I don’t need it tonight	Halkan kana na hin barbaachisu
I would think about that too	Anis kana irratti nan yaada ture
But we did it.	Garuu ni goone.
I want to talk about you.	Waa'ee kee dubbachuu barbaada.
This one was a good idea.	Inni kun yaada gaarii ture.
Not with the issue.	Dhimma waliin miti.
I think he can do it	Inni gochuu danda'a jedheen yaada
You’re not that important.	Ati hangas barbaachisaa miti.
I would never say that	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin jedhu ture
It’s not that bad.	Hamma kana hamaa miti.
It was always good.	Yeroo hundumaa gaarii ture.
He sure doesn't want me around.	Inni mirkanaa'aa naannoo na hin barbaadu.
I can't see them now	Amma isaan arguu hin danda'u
He never thought, it was an accident.	Inni gonkumaa hin yaadne, balaa ture.
I thought she needed a drink	Dhugaatii ishee barbaachisa jedheen yaade
I have two questions.	Gaaffii lama qaba.
But I didn't do it	Ani garuu hin goone
Which is not entirely accurate.	Kan guutummaatti sirrii hin taane.
I can't be.	Ani ta'uu hin danda'u.
What should we do?	Maal gochuu qabna.
This seems like the right answer.	Kun deebii sirrii fakkaata.
I wondered what they were doing	Maal gochaa jiru jedheen yaade
He was right at the time.	Yeroo sanatti sirrii ture.
It didn’t matter if he knew those people or not.	Namoota sana beekuu fi dhiisuu isaa homaa hin turre.
I like a little bit of everything	Waan hundumaa xiqqoo natti tola
I mean, he was great	Inni guddaa ture jechuu kooti
There was nothing there though.	Achitti wanti tokkollee hin turre garuu.
I would have done that	Silaa akkas nan godha ture
Lots of noise .	Sagalee baay'ee .
Now that’s just bad.	Amma sun hamaa qofa.
I want to admit it, though	Ani amanuu barbaada, garuu
I still didn’t want to believe it	Ammallee amanuu hin barbaanne
I just want to know why	Maaliif akka ta'e qofa beekuu barbaada
Maybe an hour.	Tarii sa'aatii tokko.
No one knew where he was going.	Eessa akka deemu namni beeku hin turre.
I couldn't believe this was all true	Kun hundi dhugaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
This is a possibility.	Kun ta’uu danda’a.
Now I was alone with the kids	Amma ijoollee waliin kophaa koo ture
It's not right.	Sirrii miti.
That doesn’t help.	Sun hin gargaaru.
We are absolutely fine.	Nuti guutummaatti gaarii dha.
I know little about their daily lives	Waa'ee jireenya isaanii guyyaa guyyaa xiqqoo nan beeka
They want to know who looks good.	Eenyu akka gaarii fakkaatu beekuu barbaadu.
He really was.	Inni dhuguma ture.
And he will do it again.	Ammas ni godha.
Every night.	Halkan hunda.
You’re not in a good mood.	Miira gaarii keessa hin jirtu.
A few but not many	Muraasa garuu baay'ee miti
He never really did.	Dhuguma gonkumaa hin goone.
All this hope.	Abdiin kun hundi.
I wasn’t the one for him	Ani isa isaaf hin turre
He needs to make some money.	Maallaqa tokko tokko argachuu qaba.
Fortunately, no one was in there at the time.	Akka carraa ta'ee yeroo sanatti namni achi keessa hin turre.
He has a clear language.	Afaan ifa ta’e qaba.
In this case it wasn’t even my business.	Haala kana keessatti dhimma koo illee hin turre.
But not for long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraaf miti.
Lots of things you haven't done.	Wantoota baay'ee ati hin goone.
Then it was.	Sana booda ture.
Something is going to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf jira.
But that wasn’t all really.	Garuu sun hundi dhuguma hin turre.
It’s not just him.	Isa qofa miti.
But that’s how they work together.	Garuu akkasitti waliin hojjetu.
I almost wish that were the case	Osoo akkas ta'ee natti tola jechuun ni danda'ama
I couldn't go.	Ani deemuu hin dandeenye.
And I did the same thing.	Anis akkas godhe.
Hours and hours.	Sa'aatii fi sa'aatii.
It’s not just part of it.	Kutaa isaa qofa miti.
He knows the truth.	Dhugaa dhugaa ni beeka.
You know that’s not true.	Sun dhugaa akka hin taane ni beekta.
That was me.	Sun ana ture.
We have children.	Ijoollee qabna.
I just love it so much	Baay'ee jaalladha qofa
I just didn’t know what to do	Ani garuu maal akkan godhu qofa hin beeku ture
She didn’t want him to go.	Isheen akka inni deemu hin barbaanne.
In the hospital.	Mana yaalaa keessatti.
You can't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeessu.
I'm very fond of it.	Ani baay'ee natti tola.
I can't do it for you	Siif gochuu hin danda'u
I know she wants the best for me	Isheen waan gaarii akka naaf barbaaddu nan beeka
Maybe he's just good.	Tarii inni gaarii qofa ta'uu danda'a.
Not sure it even works.	Illee akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa miti.
I knew this was just one night.	Kun halkan tokko qofa akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
He is my life.	Inni jireenya kooti.
That wouldn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu ture.
I’ve wanted to say that for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas jechuu barbaade
I’m good at them.	Ani isaan irratti gaarii dha.
They can buy that.	Sana bitachuu danda'u.
But that's not going to happen.	Garuu sun hin ta'u.
I was in a really good mood though	Ani garuu dhuguma miira gaarii keessa ture
He knew he had made a mistake.	Dogoggora akka hojjete beeka ture.
I think he wants to do the right thing	Waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuu barbaada jedheen yaada
You like doing that.	Sun gochuun sitti tola.
She hadn’t thought of that.	Akkas jettee hin yaadne turte.
They had no chance.	Carraa hin qaban turan.
Expect a couple of hours here	Sa'aatii lama lama asitti eegaa
I was looking for you	Si barbaadaa ture
It was like that in those days, not now	Bara sana amma osoo hin taane akkas ture
If someone leaves the meal.	Yoo namni nyaata keessaa ba'e.
Chances are that shouldn't happen.	Carraan sun ta'uu hin qabu.
Not so today.	Akkas miti har'a.
You had nothing.	Ati homaa hin qabdu turte.
He didn’t have a good answer	Deebii gaarii hin qabu ture
It was all the same.	Hundi isaa tokko ture.
But this can’t be right.	Garuu kun sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u.
I didn’t want to play	Taphachuu hin barbaanne
I knew he had it	Akka inni qabu nan beeka ture
I love you, sorry	Si jaalladha dhiifama
I was the exception.	Ani kanaan ala ture.
Now, that’s a good dog.	Amma, sun saree gaarii dha.
It all took time.	Hundi isaa yeroo fudhate.
You are right on this issue.	Dhimma kana irratti sirrii dha.
She has no idea.	Yaada hin qabdu.
But that’s not the time right now.	Garuu yeroon sun yeroo ammaa miti.
I couldn’t see him anymore	Kana booda isa arguu hin dandeenye
I think it was funny	Qoosaa ture jedheen yaada
He knew exactly what he had done.	Waan hojjete sirriitti beeka ture.
Not that time at all, that’s okay.	Yeroon sun tasumaa miti, sun homaa miti.
That was never the case in our case.	Dhimma keenya keessatti wanti akkasii gonkumaa hin turre.
It seems to be in good shape.	Haala gaarii irra kan jiru fakkaata.
I know stuff like that	Waan akkasii nan beeka
I think those are good ideas	Isaan sun yaada gaarii natti fakkaata
But that wasn’t the only thing.	Garuu wanti kana qofa hin turre.
I know it's not going to be human	Nama ta'uuf akka hin deemne nan beeka
I didn’t mean anything from it	Irraa homaa jechuu koo hin turre
You need sleep, and you still need it.	Hirriba si barbaachisa, ammas si barbaachisa.
I want to do it again.	Ammas gochuun barbaada.
This didn't work.	Kun hin hojjenne.
He didn't want anything.	Homaa hin barbaanne.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
That can be a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii ta’uu danda’a.
Why it doesn't work.	Maaliif akka hin hojjenne.
I really didn’t want to know.	Dhuguma beekuu hin barbaanne.
It could be you.	Si ta'uu danda'a.
I want some alone time with you	Yeroo xiqqoo kophaa koo si waliin barbaada
My wife's husband.	Haadha manaa koo.
I am sure it will happen	Akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa dha
Not to make it clear, though.	Ifa gochuuf miti garuu.
I said that was fine with me.	Anis sun naaf gaarii dha jedheen.
It will be fine without him	Isa malee gaarii ta'a
You know what’s coming.	Waan dhufu ni beekta.
But not entirely.	Garuu guutummaatti miti.
It was obviously really great.	Dhuguma guddaa akka ture ifaadha.
There's a lot going on, you know	Waan baay'een deemaa jira, beekta
You have to find a way.	Karaa argachuu qabda.
I don't know anything about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku.
They were on the road.	Karaa irra turan.
Now it looked very different.	Amma garuu baayyee adda fakkaata ture.
I certainly disagree with them.	Ani isaan waliin akkan walii hin galle beekamaadha.
I said I have no way.	Karaa hin qabu jedheen.
The reason for this was man.	Sababni kanaa nama ture.
I need that for me.	Sana naaf barbaachisa.
We are your only true chance.	Carraa dhugaa keessan nu qofa.
I think we should have it	qabaachuu qabna jedheen yaada
Should be back in a week	Torban booda deebi'uu qaba
I was with her that day.	Guyyaa sana ishee waliin ture.
Except that she wasn’t a wife.	Haadha manaa akka hin turre malee.
Something else had to go there.	Wanti biraa achi deemuu qaba ture.
Me on my own.	Ana of irratti.
But she never did.	Isheen garuu gonkumaa hin goone.
It shouldn't have existed.	Jiraachuu hin qabu ture.
This is usually not necessary.	Yeroo baayʼee kun barbaachisaa miti.
There must be.	Jiraachuu qaba.
No one has seen you.	Namni si arge hin jiru.
But I couldn't say that	Ani garuu akkas jechuu hin dandeenye
You don't know where you are.	Bakka jirtu hin beektu.
He tried that.	Sana yaale.
But he is doing great.	Inni garuu waan guddaa hojjechaa jira.
I can be their father.	Ani abbaa isaanii ta'uu nan danda'a.
I think you did something very important for him	Waan baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e tokko isaaf goote jedheen yaada
But that wouldn't be necessary.	Garuu sun barbaachisaa hin ta'u ture.
I was the only girl in the car.	Konkolaataa sana keessa intala ana qofa ture.
He had hope.	Abdii qaba ture.
He was a good man.	Nama gaarii ture.
I want to tell him this	Kana itti himuu barbaada
Maybe I have something for you	Tarii waan tokko siif qabaachuu danda'a
She didn't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabdu turte.
He did nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin goone.
It just doesn’t exist anymore.	Kana booda hin jiru qofa.
No one likes him.	Namni isa jaallatu hin jiru.
I'm not with anyone.	Ani nama waliin hin jiru.
But not more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa miti.
I wanted to be like that.	Ani akkas ta'uu barbaade.
He knows a lot.	Baay'ee beeka.
I just want to know what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru qofa beekuu barbaada
Of course, he could do better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu akka dandaʼu beekamaadha.
I would do whatever I needed to	Waan na barbaachisu hunda nan godha ture
This was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ture.
No problems so far.	Hanga ammaatti rakkoon hin jiru.
But it will be easier.	Garuu salphaa ta'a.
I suspect you are too	Ati illee akka jirtu nan shakka
I had to go with him.	Isa waliin deemuun qaba ture.
But it didn’t look like that.	Garuu akkas hin fakkaatu ture.
I don’t think there’s anything you can do about it.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
In my case it was my mother.	Dhimma koo irratti haadha koo ture.
You have me.	Ati na qabda.
I say it won't happen.	Hin ta'u nan jedha.
It was something new.	Waan haaraa ture.
I was here alone	Ani kophaa koo as ture
There may not be anything in there.	Achi keessa wanti tokkollee jiraachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
It still doesn’t exist.	Ammallee hin jiru.
I didn’t need that.	Sana na hin barbaachifne.
He's here most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee as jira.
He is doing well.	Inni waan gaarii hojjechaa jira.
It didn’t really matter, of course.	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabu ture, beekamaadha.
I made it happen so many times.	Yeroo baayyee akkas akka ta'u nan godhe.
Just new friends.	Hiriyyoota haaraa qofa.
Look me in the eye.	Ija keessa na ilaalaa.
I can't have that kind of life there	Jireenya akkasii achitti qabaachuu hin danda'u
I can give it to you now	Amma siif kennuu nan danda'a
Maybe that's why.	Tarii kanaaf ta'uu danda'a.
I'll probably be back now	Amma deebi'uu hin oolu
in.	keessa.
I didn’t go to a class.	Kutaa tokko hin deemne.
We can’t tell.	Himuu hin dandeenyu.
I’ve been with you for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf si bira ture
I really wish I didn’t have to go tomorrow.	Dhuguma osoo boru deemuun hin barbaachifne natti tola.
I can't see this issue	Dhimma kana arguu hin danda'u
I'm happy for you.	Siif gammadeera.
Not everyone likes you.	Namni hundi si hin jaallatu.
I know you were just doing your job	Hojii kee qofa hojjechaa akka turte nan beeka
This was pretty bad.	Kun baayyee hamaa ture.
Just to help someone else.	Nama biraa gargaaruuf qofa.
I like a lot about him	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'een natti tola
I wasn't really sure	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa hin turre
He wasn’t doing much good.	Gaarii guddaa hojjechaa hin turre.
It just started.	Amma jalqabe.
My new life.	Jireenya koo haaraa.
I didn't know him	Ani isa hin beekne
I don't think so.	Akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
I didn't do anything.	Ani homaa hin goone.
He lives in the place for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf bakka sana keessa jiraata.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
That's what I want	Anis kanuma barbaada
I didn’t quite see the whole picture.	Suuraa guutuu sirriitti hin argine.
I didn't know what time of day it was	Guyyaa keessaa sa'aatii meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku ture
Now turn back.	Amma duubatti deebi'i.
But that’s not the case this time.	Garuu yeroo kana akkas miti.
He even considered doing it again	Ammas hojjechuuf illee yaade
I know this isn’t everything	Kun waan hunda akka hin taane nan beeka
You don’t know what’s out there.	Waan ala jiru hin beektu.
Not exactly mine.	Sirriitti kan koo miti.
I can't do everything for you	Waan hundumaa siif gochuu hin danda'u
I thought so	Akkas jedheen yaade
I knew where it was going	Eessa akka deemu nan beeka ture
I didn't tell him why.	Maaliif akka ta'e itti hin himne.
I might just get another drink	Dhugaatii biraa qofa argachuu danda'a
But who could that person be?.	Garuu namni sun eenyu ta'uu danda'a?.
I will make my way towards it	Karaa koo gara isaatti nan godha
He was my everything.	Inni waan hundumaa koo ture.
These lucky people.	Namoota carraa qaban kana.
He had a good feeling.	Miira gaarii qaba ture.
That’s nothing new, she said.	Sun waan haaraa miti jette.
They are human.	Isaan nama.
Just not here.	Asitti miti qofa.
It should give you an idea.	Yaada siif kennuu qaba.
It won’t go away for long	Yeroo dheeraaf hin deemu
Just like you.	Akkuma kee.
I need time to do this	Kana hojjechuuf yeroo na barbaachisa
Then it won't happen.	Sana booda hin ta'u.
I don’t want to be here	Ani as jiraachuu hin barbaadu
I’ll just go for it.	Ani qofa itti deema.
Many have, but only rarely.	Baay'een isaanii qaban, garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
But mostly when.	Garuu irra caalaa yeroo.
That was really good.	Sun dhuguma gaarii ture.
All of them.	Hundi isaanii.
I didn't have much to say about that	Waa'ee sanaa waan baay'ee jedhu hin qabu ture
It was just too soon	Dafee qofa ture
I began to fill her in on what had happened	Waan ta'e ishee guutuu jalqabe
I don't know what you mean.	Maal jechuu kee hin beeku.
He wanted to stay here	Asitti turuu barbaade
Someone sits outside.	Namni tokko ala taa'a.
That’s not my issue.	Sun dhimma koo miti.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
She was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola turte.
Even when it’s not, it’s really .	Yeroo kana hin taane illee, dhuguma .
I had a lot of work for him	Hojii baay'een isaaf qaba ture
I still know almost nothing about it, really.	Ammallee waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama, dhuguma.
I could help with that.	Sana irratti gargaaruu nan danda'a ture.
I could see no emotion in her eyes	Ija ishee keessaa miira tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye
It’s not a human being.	Nama miti.
She was still his.	Ammas kan isaa turte.
It's not about the good stuff.	Waa'ee waan gaarii miti.
I think so.	Akkas jedheen yaada.
Now no one could come to him.	Amma namni itti dhufuu hin dandeenye.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
But she had everything.	Garuu waan hundumaa qabdi turte.
I think they might know that	Isaan kana beekuu danda'u jedheen yaada
Lots of work though	Hojii baay'ee garuu
I search everywhere, but I can't find it	Bakka hunda barbaada, garuu argachuu hin danda'u
But that was not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas hin turre.
She hadn't noticed, as he had noticed her clothes.	Isheen hin hubanne turte, akkuma inni uffata ishee hubate.
I didn’t think everything was so bad	Wanti hundi hamma kana hamaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
We cannot do more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
They really have a lot of great stuff.	Dhuguma waan baayyee guddaa ta'e qabu.
When we did, we did well on a couple of them.	Yeroo kana goonu, isaan keessaa tokko lama irratti gaarii hojjenne.
Sometimes I wonder why.	Yeroo tokko tokko maaliif jedheen yaada.
I don't know exactly.	Ani sirriitti hin beeku.
I don’t have a real answer.	Deebii dhugaa hin qabu.
I love the dresses	Uffata baay'een jaalladha
I know with what now.	Maal waliin amma beeka.
I wonder what it was	Maal ture jedheen yaada
Still our daughter.	Ammas intala keenya.
It wasn’t doing so well.	Hanga gaarii hojjechaa hin turre.
The work is still on.	Hojiin ammallee irra jira.
I saw it there this morning	Ganama kana achitti arge
But this is not going to be so easy.	Garuu kun akkas salphaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
I don't think about it	Ani itti hin yaadu
Now he had no one, nothing.	Amma nama hin qabu, homaa hin qabu ture.
He knew you when you were unconscious	Yeroo ati of hin beekne si beeka ture
It became a very lively place.	Bakka baayyee jireenya qabu taate.
Something is very wrong.	Waan baayyee dogoggora ta'e tokko jira.
I thought his chances were good	Carraan isaa gaarii natti fakkaate
He certainly isn’t.	Inni akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Not like me.	Akka koo miti.
He is going with you.	Inni si waliin deemaa jira.
That's what happens.	Kanuma ta'a.
I thought of my father	Abbaa kootti yaade
It wasn’t helpful.	Gargaarsa hin turre.
Of course, it could be worse.	Kana caalaa hamaa ta’uu akka danda’u beekamaadha.
I could never see myself doing that	Ani akkas gochuu koo gonkumaa of arguu hin dandeenye
Now I have no answer.	Amma deebii hin qabu.
I knew what it could be	Maal ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka ture
It was pretty obvious why.	Maaliif akka ta'e baay'ee ifa ture.
I need to make a big question	Gaaffii guddaa tokko gochuun na barbaachisa
I should never have told him that	Silaa gonkumaa akkas itti himuu hin qabu ture
But you can't.	Garuu hin dandeessu.
I don't know who that is.	Sun eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku.
Which is not extensive.	Kan bal'aa hin taane.
I wanted to know what was going on in there	Waan achi keessa ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaade
I can't do everything.	Waan hundumaa gochuu hin danda'u.
We just have to see it.	Arguu qofa qabna.
If it were a book.	Osoo kitaaba ta'ee.
Are you one of them?.	Ati isaan keessaa tokko?.
She needed to know what it was.	Maal akka taʼe beekuu qabdi turte.
You are nothing like him.	Ati homaa akka isaa miti.
It was too much.	Garmalee ture.
I can't tell you what to do	Waan gootu sitti himuu hin danda'u
They knew that night.	Halkan sana ni beeku turan.
I'm from her.	Ani ishee irraa.
It was what he needed.	Waan isa barbaachisu ture.
Maybe that's when today.	Tarii har'a yeroo sana ta'uu danda'a.
No one should be in that space.	Namni tokkollee bakka sana keessa jiraachuu hin qabu.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
That was true.	Sun dhugaa ture.
I wasn’t quite myself after the accident	Balaa booda guutummaatti ofii koo hin turre
But it was me.	Garuu ana ture.
We need to know.	Beekuu qabna.
Sometimes she was her.	Yeroo tokko tokko isheen ishee turte.
I can't believe it happened	Ta'e jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I can't believe he did this for me	Kana naaf godhe jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
That is often not the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas miti.
I couldn’t help myself with this one.	Isa kanaan of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
I wasn’t going to leave	Ani deemuuf hin turre
I want to be inside her.	Keessa ishee ta'uu barbaada.
A good photo location.	Bakka suuraa gaarii ta'e.
There's nothing in there for you.	Achi keessaa wanti siif ta'u hin jiru.
Not many people.	Namoonni baay'een miti.
But I couldn't find any.	Ani garuu tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
I almost can't believe it	Ani amanuu hin danda'u jechuun ni danda'ama
He wanted one.	Tokko barbaade.
Tell me now.	Amma natti himi.
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
On a day like this	Guyyaa akka kanaa
If so, that's fine.	Yoo ta'e gaarii dha.
I was the picture.	Ani suuraa ture.
This was not his way.	Kun karaa isaa hin turre.
He wouldn't do that to her again	Ammas akkas ishee hin godhu ture
I knew it was only a matter of time	Dhimma yeroo qofa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
This is not going to be your whole life.	Kun jireenya kee guutuu ta'uuf hin deemu.
He was a man.	Inni nama ture.
I knew why she was leaving	Maaliif akka deemtu nan beeka ture
You can go back to my house.	Mana kootti deebi'uu dandeessa.
He doesn’t do that.	Inni akkas hin godhu.
She had nothing but them.	Isaan malee homaa hin qabdu turte.
I know you can’t see it	Arguu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
I am one of those people	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko
I told him to go	Anis deemaa jedheen
Someone has to say them.	Namni tokko isaan jechuu qaba.
He didn’t do anything good here	Asitti waan gaarii tokkollee hin hojjenne
Again, great work!.	Ammas hojii guddaa!.
I couldn't leave you	Si dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I mean, nothing.	Homaa jechuu kooti.
He had a lot of it.	Baay'ee qaba ture.
None of what you said is true.	Wanti ati jette tokkollee dhugaa miti.
He was extremely good at this.	Kana irratti garmalee gaarii ture.
I could do that.	Ani akkas gochuu nan dandaʼa ture.
I didn’t know you were here.	As akka jirtu hin beeku ture.
He has plenty of time.	Yeroo hedduu qaba.
I hope everything turns out well	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti akka ta'u abdiin qaba
I couldn’t do that to her	Ani akkas ishee gochuu hin dandeenye
We had enough money.	Maallaqa gahaa qabna turre.
I have no idea why they didn’t	Maaliif akka hin goone yaada hin qabu
I didn’t know it would go this far	Hanga kana akka deemu hin beeku ture
I always think about it	Yeroo hundumaa itti yaada
I know better than that	Kana caalaa nan beeka
I didn’t know how to say it	Akkamitti akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
It’s here.	Halkan dha.
I was about to do it, just now	Anis gochuuf jedheen ture, amma qofa
I began to see something.	Waan tokko arguu jalqabe.
This is the most likely reason.	Sababni baay’ee ta’uu danda’u kana.
He was the right person, of course.	Namni sirrii ture beekamaadha.
But what he wanted was someone who didn’t want him.	Garuu wanti inni barbaade nama isa hin barbaanne ture.
These people are not children.	Namoonni kun ijoollee miti.
. . . .	.
Just give up.	Harka kennuu qofa.
Lots of food.	Nyaata baay'ee.
I had no idea why this was happening	Kun maaliif akka ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It’s really important.	Dhuguma barbaachisaa dha.
I have no luck at all	Ani tasumaa carraa hin qabu
I had to do the same thing	Anis kanuma gochuun qaba ture
I was up here in my house	Ani as ol mana koo keessa ture
That’s not it.	Kana miti.
I have no idea they were both	Isaan lamaan akka turan yaada hin qabu
But it will be different.	Garuu adda ta'a.
It just never happened.	Ta'ee hin beeku qofa.
He wondered what that meant	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe yaade
Now she had a home.	Amma mana qabdi turte.
Maybe they are.	Tarii isaan ta'uu danda'u.
I am not forgiving.	Ani dhiifama hin godhu.
I think they should have something	Waan qabaachuu qabu jedheen yaada
I didn’t know any of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku ture.
Who became always there	Kan yeroo hunda achi jiru ta'e
But it seemed like a long time.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa natti fakkaate.
I am one of these people	Ani namoota kana keessaa tokko
Not who we are.	Eenyu akka taane miti.
It is not a question of hope.	Gaaffii abdii miti.
This was just too much.	Kun garmalee qofa ture.
I can get time with them	Isaan waliin yeroo argachuu nan danda'a
This was the best meal they had.	Kun nyaata isaan qaban keessaa isa gaarii ture.
His name, my name.	Maqaa isaa, maqaa koo.
I will never go there.	Ani gonkumaa achi hin deemu.
He was there every day.	Guyyaa hunda achi ture.
I didn’t realize he was leaving	Akka inni deemu hin hubanne
I was in school, of course.	Mana barumsaa akkan ture beekamaadha.
They want a house.	Mana barbaadu.
Not full time, of course.	Yeroo guutuu miti, beekamaadha.
I like that very much	Sun baayʼee natti tola
He just has stuff.	Inni waan qofa qaba.
He had some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko qaba ture.
I can't do anything about this	Kana irratti homaa gochuu hin danda'u
I was alone, doing nothing	Ani kophaa koo ture, homaa hin goone
Many languages ​​have spoken about me.	Afaan baay'ee kan waa'ee koo dubbate.
I could never make you a good husband.	Ani gonkumaa abbaa manaa gaarii si gochuu hin dandeenye.
It worked out well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete.
Not someone else.	Nama biraa miti.
We often shake hands.	Yeroo baayyee harka wal qabna.
Still nothing happens.	Ammas wanti ta'u hin jiru.
We have that in common.	Sana waan wal fakkaatu qabna.
I know what that is now	Sun maal akka ta'e amma beeka
That’s not usually the case.	Yeroo baay’ee akkas miti.
He was perfect.	Inni guutuu ture.
I couldn't talk about anything	Waa'ee homaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye
But he didn’t go.	Garuu inni hin deemne.
I still enjoyed it	Ammallee itti gammadeera
We have to live here.	As jiraachuu qabna.
He was there when it happened.	Yeroo ta'u achi ture.
He didn't do that.	Akkas hin goone.
A lot of people are like me.	Namoonni baay'een akka kooti.
Such, however, is not true.	Kan akkasii garuu dhugaa miti.
I really didn't know anything about it	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa waan tokkollee hin beeku ture
You should be up here.	As ol ta'uu qabda.
I hope this is a big mistake	Kun dogoggora guddaa akka ta'e abdiin qaba
I think I think they need some time	Yeroo muraasa akka isaan barbaachisu natti fakkaata jedheen yaada
It would be a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'a.
I didn’t think he was good enough.	Inni gaarii natti hin fakkaatu ture.
But it really didn’t do any work	Dhuguma garuu hojii tokkollee hin hojjenne
I’m really excited.	Dhuguma gammadeera.
No one knew anything.	Namni homaa beeku hin turre.
I didn’t know you existed	Ati akka jirtu hin beeku ture
I enjoyed it very much.	Baayyee itti gammadeera.
She was not a human being.	Isheen nama hin turre.
Many of us are there	Baay'een keenya achi jirra
You really don’t have it.	Dhuguma hin qabdu.
I’m not sure if the reasoning is valid or not.	Sababni sirrii ta’uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa’aa miti.
It was early but it was sure.	Dafee ture garuu mirkanaa'aa ture.
But she didn’t have it.	Garuu hin qabdu turte.
I'm not here much anymore	Kana booda baay'ee as hin jiru
Which goes to my point.	Kan gara yaada kootti deemu.
He shouldn't have been with her.	Ishee waliin ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I have nowhere to go	Bakka itti deemu hin qabu
I can't do that right now	Yeroo ammaa kana akkas gochuu hin danda'u
I had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I didn't say anything	Ani homaa hin dubbanne
No one can stay here for very long.	Namni baayyee dheeraaf as turuu hin danda'u.
From what he told me, that was a possibility.	Waan inni natti hime irraa, sun waan ta'uu danda'u ture.
It was a drink.	Dhugaatii ture.
I don't think so.	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
It seemed to work.	Waan hojjetu fakkaata ture.
It was never an interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii ta'ee hin beeku.
The time is now.	Yeroon amma.
I’m glad he’s here.	As jiraachuu isaatti gammadeera.
He just looked at me.	Na ilaale qofa.
I wasn’t bright enough.	Ani ifa gahaa hin turre.
We can’t do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
I’m doing really well with my diet	Nyaata koo irratti dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jira
So this was it, he thought.	Kanaaf kun ture jedhee yaade.
But more on them, later.	Garuu caalaatti isaan irratti, booda.
He wouldn't have been able to.	Silaa hin danda'u ture.
Maybe it doesn't even exist.	Tarii illee hin jiru ta'a.
and.	fi.
That’s what it was.	Kana turee.
Then I didn't care about him anymore	Sana booda kana booda waa'ee isaaf dhimma hin qabu ture
Except for a few people.	Namoota muraasa malee.
It used to work	Duraan hojjechaa ture
I used to be around a lot.	Duraan baay'ee naannoo isaa ture.
She just didn’t want to be involved.	Isheen garuu harka keessaa qabaachuu qofa hin barbaanne.
It seemed like a mistake.	Dogoggora fakkaata ture.
I think it’s good to go.	Deemuuf gaarii natti fakkaata.
I love that about him.	Waa'ee isaa sana nan jaalladha.
Not each other, not anymore.	Wal miti, kana booda miti.
If so, no problem.	Yoo akkas ta'e rakkoo hin qabu.
He must know something else he knows	Waan biraa inni beeku beekuu qaba
She was looking at me.	Isheen na ilaalaa turte.
I know a lot of it from home.	Baay'ee isaa manaa beeka.
Once I couldn’t do that	Yeroo tokko akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
They had to tell us what to do.	Waan goonu nutti himuu qabu turan.
They all exist today.	Hundi isaanii har’a jiru.
This is a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii dha.
You know and I know.	Ati beekta anis beeka.
But these people are never parents.	Garuu namoonni kun gonkumaa warra miti.
I can't tell you how to be yourself	Akkamitti of ta'uu akka qabdu sitti himuu hin danda'u
Not that it's any more important.	Kana caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e jechuu miti.
If so, well and good.	Yoo akkas ta'e gaarii fi gaarii.
I went home with her.	Ishee waliin gara manaatti deeme.
Very good hands, but not good enough	Harka baayyee gaarii, garuu gaarii gahaa miti
He couldn’t keep up with his own life, he thought.	Jireenya ofii waliin deemuu hin dandeenye jedhee yaade.
I have no idea what went wrong	Maaltu akka dogoggora ta'e yaada hin qabu
You can leave your comments here.	Yaada keessan as irratti dhiisuu dandeessu.
I think that probably spoke to all of us	Sun tarii hunda keenya dubbate jedheen yaada
I didn't want any of it to happen	Isa keessaa tokkollee akka ta'u hin barbaanne
I knew this wasn’t going to be easy.	Kun salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
I'm very happy for him.	Baay'een isaaf gammadeera.
They were very tall men.	Isaan namoota baayʼee dheeraa turan.
I wish they hadn't done that	Osoo akkas hin goone ta'ee natti tola
I could be totally wrong with this though	Ani garuu kanaan guutummaatti dogoggora ta'uu danda'a
You have no idea what that looks like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu yaada hin qabdu.
I just can't do anything here	Asitti homaa gochuu qofa hin danda'u
I said that was fine	Anis sun gaarii dha jedheen
It was already there.	Duraan ture.
I know good people.	Namoota gaarii nan beeka.
I couldn’t tell him that, of course	Ani akkas itti himuu hin dandeenye, beekamaadha
I think he was still waiting for me	Ammas na eegaa ture natti fakkaata
You have to help him.	Isa gargaaruu qabda.
He knew that voice well	Sagalee sana sirriitti beeka ture
I can't tell him.	Itti himuu hin danda'u.
I’m lucky, everyone has a job	Ani carraa qaba, namni hundi hojii qaba
He always wanted me.	Yeroo hundumaa na barbaada ture.
This is no small thing.	Kun waan xiqqoo miti.
You can give of yourself.	Of kennuu dandeessa.
I love that part more than almost anything else	Kutaa sana waan hundumaa caalaa jechuun ni danda'ama baay'een jaalladha
I thought that was a good thing	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaate
I can't go home again	Ammas gara manaatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
The easiest one.	Kan salphaa ta'e.
But I didn't care	Ani garuu dhimma hin qabu ture
This time we did the right thing.	Yeroo kana waan sirrii ta'e hojjenne.
I think that’s everything, so far	Waan hundumaa kanuma natti fakkaata, hanga ammaatti
You know what you are.	Maal akka taate ni beekta.
I was going to make a new one.	Haaraa hojjechuuf ture.
All your work.	Hojii keessan hunda.
People don’t always have that luck.	Namoonni yeroo hunda carraa akkasii hin qaban.
It looks bad.	Hamaa fakkaata.
You know he does.	Akka godhu ni beekta.
It happened after hours.	Sa'aatii booda ta'e.
They hadn’t seen it.	Isaan hin argine turan.
It doesn’t seem to matter.	Dhimma waan qabu hin fakkaatu.
We have no real friends.	Hiriyyoota dhugaa hin qabnu.
It was a life he loved.	Jireenya inni jaallatu ture.
I was pretty bad at this.	Kana irratti baay'een hamaa ture.
I knew he wouldn’t be here long.	Yeroo dheeraaf as akka hin jirre nan beeka ture.
I just haven’t seen you around here before	Kana dura naannoo asitti si hin argine qofa
It seemed like a minor issue.	Dhimma xiqqoo fakkaata ture.
Tonight it’s just noise	Halkan kana sagalee qofa
You are doing great.	Waan guddaa hojjechaa jirta.
They know me so well.	Isaan akka malee na beeku.
This way people could leave me alone.	Haala kanaan namoonni kophaa na dhiisuu danda'u turan.
I didn't even see who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e illee hin argine
I couldn’t help asking if you needed something all the time	Yeroo hunda waan tokko si barbaachisa jedhee gaafachuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
She didn't need this now.	Amma kana ishee hin barbaachifne.
Didn't see it happen	Akka ta'u hin argine
He wanted to be with her	Ishee waliin ta'uu barbaade
That was a good feeling.	Sun miira gaarii ture.
I mean, I’m not here anymore	Kana booda as hin jiru jechuu kooti
I walked right out of there	Anis sirriitti achi keessaa ba'e
I should have asked her more about that	Silaa waa'ee sanaa caalaatti ishee gaafachuu qaba ture
I saw him do something, and it was very wrong	Waan tokko hojjechuu isaa arge, baayʼee dogoggora ture
But before that, there were many of them.	Kana dura garuu baay'een isaanii turan.
Not that you have to know that, necessarily.	Sana beekuu qabda jechuu miti, dirqama.
I just love it right now	Yeroo ammaa kana qofa baay'een jaalladha
There would be no answer.	Silaa deebii hin jiru ture.
They knew good and evil.	Gaarii fi hamaa ni beeku turan.
I hadn’t seen her in a few weeks	Torban muraasaaf ishee hin argine ture
They didn’t see me.	Isaan na hin argine.
You think you are.	Ati akka jirtu sitti fakkaata.
Not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin ta'u.
About almost everything.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
I wasn't sure what else was going on	Waan biraa maaltu akka ta'aa jiru mirkanaa'aa hin turre
You know what happens in these things.	Wantoota kana keessatti maaltu akka ta'u ni beekta.
I began to help him	Anis isa gargaaruu jalqabe
You know that we do.	Akka nuti goonu beekta.
Not even that I couldn't leave him	Kanaaf illee miti isa dhiisuu hin dandeenye
But maybe you won't.	Garuu tarii hin gootu ta'a.
I can't believe no one wants to buy this	Namni kana bitachuu barbaadu hin jiru jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
It’s just a question of time and time again.	Gaaffii yeroo fi yeroo qofa.
Feelings, emotions, thoughts	Miira, miira, yaada
This was a new idea.	Kun yaada haaraa ture.
What was mine.	Kan koo maal ture.
I didn’t notice it weeks ago	Torban dura hin hubanne
Who was like that.	Eenyu akkas ture.
It was like him doing this.	Kana gochuun isaa akka isaa ture.
So even we.	Kanaaf nuti illee.
I was alone long before that	Sana dura yeroo dheeraa dura kophaa koo ture
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
He had done nothing	Homaa hin goone ture
I didn’t know who she was	Eenyu akka taate hin beeku ture
You are a human being	Ati nama dha .
I know you want more	Kana caalaa akka barbaaddu nan beeka
I want to work on it	Irratti hojjechuu barbaada
I know everyone.	Nama hunda nan beeka.
I'm trying a lot.	Baay'een yaalaa jira.
But you don't understand.	Garuu siif hin galle.
That’s how he gave himself up.	Akkasitti of kenne.
But maybe.	Garuu tarii.
But for him.	Garuu isaaf.
A very important person	Nama baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e
But why should this happen.	Garuu kun maaliif ta'uu qaba.
Sorry, but there is.	Dhiifama garuu ni jira.
I didn’t know this existed	Kun akka jiru hin beeku ture
Every little thing throughout.	Guutummaatti waan xiqqoo hunda.
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
He would have lived there.	Silaa achi jiraata ture.
Must be later in the day.	Guyyaa booda ta'uu qaba.
But none of that happened.	Garuu sun tokkollee hin taane.
I shouldn’t have told you, yet	Sitti himuu hin qabu ture, ammallee
It wasn’t good enough.	Gaarii gahaa hin turre.
I could have done better maybe	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu nan danda'a ture tarii
But it shouldn't have been him.	Garuu isa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I didn’t want to know any of them	Isaan keessaa tokkollee beekuu hin barbaanne
So, it's been pretty good.	Kanaaf, baayyee gaarii ta'ee jira.
Love your wife.	Haadha manaa kee jaalladhu.
I would never do it.	Ani gonkumaa hin godhu ture.
But, they were still different.	Garuu, ammallee adda turan.
He must know what happened	Waan ta'e beekuu qaba
I couldn’t help myself, anymore	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye, kana booda
No one does not know the way.	Namni karaa hin beekne hin jiru.
I'm not so sure you're a guy	Ani akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti gurbaa ta'uu kee
I didn’t do anything to it	Ani homaa itti hin goone
He would have had every reason to do so.	Silaa akkas gochuuf sababa guutuu qaba ture.
I didn't know what was going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru hin beeku ture.
That’s not a problem anymore.	Kana booda sun rakkoo miti.
Which is very important.	Kan baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e.
That's when it came.	Yeroo sana ture kan dhufe.
I said that would be fine.	Anis sun gaarii ta'a jedheen ture.
It must be you.	Si ta'uu qaba.
I didn’t know who she was	Eenyu akka taate hin beeku ture
That’s absolutely right.	Sun guutummaatti sirrii dha.
It couldn’t have been any other way.	Karaa biraa ta’uu hin danda’u ture.
It’s just really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola qofa.
I have no idea why this is happening	Kun maaliif akka ta'aa jiru yaada hin qabu
Now it would work.	Amma ni hojjeta ture.
Loud and clear.	Sagalee guddaa fi ifa ta’e.
I always thought you were too good for me	Yeroo hundumaa ati baay'ee naaf gaarii taate jedheen yaada ture
I saw no humor in that	Sana keessatti qoosaa tokkollee hin argine
It was his favorite place.	Bakka inni jaallatu ture.
It looks like herself.	Akka ofii ishee fakkaata.
That could be an entire day.	Sun guyyaa guutuu taʼuu dandaʼa.
This was extremely good.	Kun garmalee gaarii ture.
I began to wonder what they could be.	Maal ta’uu danda’u jedheen of gaafachuu jalqabe.
It was dangerous.	Balaa qaba ture.
It looks pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
This was none of that.	Kun sana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
I knew what he wanted	Waan inni barbaadu nan beeka ture
I have been there several times	Yeroo hedduu achi tureera
I wasn’t trying to do that	Ani akkas gochuuf yaalaa hin turre
We need to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
They are nothing.	Isaan homaa miti.
I knew this all along	Kana yeroo hundumaa beeka ture
Everything that could ever happen.	Wanti yoomiyyuu ta’uu danda’u hunda.
So it wasn’t such a good idea	Kanaaf yaada gaarii akkasii hin turre
I won’t do this anymore.	Kana booda kana hin godhu.
I was just like that.	Ani akkas qofa ture.
They weren’t.	Isaan hin turre.
I thought about my father	Waa'ee abbaa kootti yaade
And the.	Fi kan.
I know her too well	Garmalee akka gaariitti ishee beeka
But that’s not why.	Garuu kanaaf miti.
So far I cared very little	Hanga ammaatti baay'ee xiqqoo dhimma itti ba'e
She was one of them.	Isheen tokko turte.
Maybe he really thought that.	Tarii dhuguma akkas jedhee yaade ta'a.
I can't believe you're here.	As jirta jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
He might have to go,' he said.	Deemu qaba ta'a,' jedhe.
Soon I will make her look like you again	Yeroo dhiyootti ammas akka si fakkaattu nan godha
During the day.	Guyyaa keessa.
I knew it was my father.	Abbaa koo ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture.
Maybe I'll never see him again.	Tarii kana booda isa arguu hin danda'u.
I haven’t done this for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf kana hin goone
I didn’t want to leave you here for long	Yeroo dheeraa asitti si dhiisuu hin barbaanne
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
He did that well.	Sana akka gaariitti godhe.
I want to know.	Ani beekuu barbaada.
It's not happening right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana ta'aa hin jiru.
Not entirely sure if that's a good thing or not.	Sun waan gaarii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
There is something we don’t understand.	Waan nuti hin hubanne tokko jira.
She could not have believed much else.	Silaa waan biraa baayʼee amanuu hin dandeessu turte.
You are mine and only mine.	Ati kan kooti kan koo qofa.
She did not know whether any of it was true.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee dhugaa taʼuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beektu turte.
I never know without one.	Tokko malee gonkumaa hin beeku.
I know exactly what this feels like	Kun maal akka fakkaatu sirriitti beeka
That it was true.	Dhugaa akka ture.
It’s not like that for you.	Siif akkas miti.
What we are.	Waan taane.
He can still do something.	Ammas waan tokko gochuu danda'a.
It could be even higher than that.	Kana caalaa illee ol ta'uu danda'a.
It certainly wasn’t anymore.	Kana booda akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I haven’t seen my wife all day	Guyyaa guutuu haadha manaa koo hin argine
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
I came alone, all the way	Kophaa koo dhufe, karaa hundumaa
He said it wasn't right.	Sirrii miti jedhe.
He is not one of them.	Inni isaan keessaa tokko miti.
Not so with this one.	Isa kanaan akkas miti.
It came to himself.	Ofitti dhufe.
I just need to eat .	Nyaachuu qofa na barbaachisa .
But that's it.	Garuu kanuma.
He made it really great.	Dhuguma guddaa akka ta'u godhe.
I didn’t have that either	Anis sana hin qabu ture
I didn’t mean that.	Ani akkas jechuu hin barbaanne.
But it may not happen here.	Garuu asitti ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
She was always there.	Yeroo hundumaa achi turte.
And it still exists.	Ammas ni jira.
I should have done as he asked this morning	Silaa ganama kana akkuma inni gaafate gochuun qaba ture
I know they were here	As akka turan nan beeka
Knowing things you can’t know.	Wantoota beekuu hin dandeenye beekuu.
He shouldn’t have been anywhere else	Bakka biraa jiraachuu hin qabu ture
But he was hopeless.	Garuu abdii hin qabne ture.
They had so much more.	Isaan kana caalaa waan baay'ee qaban turan.
My favorite though is my mother’s.	Kan ani jaalladhu garuu kan haadha kooti.
I need what you know	Waan ati beektu na barbaachisa
But that doesn’t work now.	Garuu sun amma hin hojjetu.
Outside of him, nothing much happened.	Isa ala wanti baay'ee ta'e hin jiru.
That’s why it must be such an issue.	Kanaaf akkas dhimma ta’uu qaba.
Sorry about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dhiifama.
But it wasn’t his.	Garuu kan isaa hin turre.
It seems so simple.	Akkasitti salphaa fakkaata.
She was in it.	Isheen keessa turte.
Wrong, just a little bit	Dogoggora, xiqqoo qofa
I’m not saying they’re not good.	Isaan gaarii miti jechuu koo miti.
I can't do any more	Kana caalaa gochuu hin danda'u
I’m doing that, obviously.	Ani akkas gochaa jira, ifaadha.
It's not right and it doesn't help.	Sirrii miti hin gargaaru.
There is no other	Kan biraa hin jiru
I didn't do anything	Ani homaa hin goone
I think today is a good day	Har'a guyyaa gaarii natti fakkaata
Many hours.	Sa'aatii baay'ee.
We have no intention of this happening.	Kun akka ta'u yaada hin qabnu.
This can be around the room.	Kun naannoo kutaa ta’uu danda’a.
I just think you need to know this	Kana beekuu qabdu qofa jedheen yaada
There is now.	Amma jira.
Her father's friends.	Hiriyyoota abbaa ishee.
But I wouldn't tell him that	Ani garuu akkas itti hin himu ture
We are in the mood though.	Miira keessa jirra garuu.
I didn’t have him the whole time	Yeroo guutuu isa hin qabne
He shouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture.
It's just never been about that.	Waa'ee sanaa qofa ta'ee hin beeku.
He saw that he still had some money	Ammallee qarshii tokko tokko akka qabu arge
Just an idea.	Yaada qofa.
I really didn’t want anything	Dhuguma homaa hin barbaanne
He never did it.	Inni gonkumaa hin goone.
He must be good.	Inni gaarii ta'uu qaba.
It’s a different job than the one that went before.	Kan kanaan dura deeme irraa hojii adda.
He looked out of place.	Bakka hin qabne ilaale.
I didn’t want to talk anymore.	Kana booda dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
It wasn’t completely hopeless	Guutummaatti abdii hin qabne hin turre
These are new.	Isaan kun haaraa dha.
I can't believe this is happening	Kun ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
That’s one of the reasons she loves him.	Sababni isheen isa jaallattu keessaa tokko kanuma.
I still don't understand.	Ammallee naaf hin galle.
I didn’t really understand it at the time	Yeroo sanatti dhuguma hin hubanne
It was a disaster.	Balaa ture.
There was a guy.	Gurbaa tokko ture.
You're just you.	Ati si qofa.
I couldn't say anything to her.	Homaa ishee dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
It seems like a long time ago now.	Amma yeroo dheeraa dura fakkaata.
I couldn't make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuu hin dandeenye.
I like my job too much	Hojii koo garmalee natti tola
They know what will happen soon.	Waan yeroo dhiyootti ta'u ni beeku.
It looks a lot like him.	Baay'ee isa fakkaata.
Maybe I just have to do some	Tarii tokko tokko hojjechuu qofa qaba ta'a
He looked around the room for another good long while	Naannoo kutaa sanaa yeroo dheeraa gaarii kan biraa ilaale
I know him very well	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka
I wanted to ask you	Si gaafachuu barbaade
Saying something, maybe.	Waan tokko dubbachuu, tarii.
I just need some space for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf bakka muraasa qofa na barbaachisa
I still saw around her	Ammallee naannoo ishee arge
She’s not like you.	Isheen akka kee miti.
I'm excited.	Ani gammadeera.
Just this one time.	Yeroo tokko kana qofa.
That's how it should always be	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'uu qaba
There must be.	Jiraachuu qaba.
Which is very important	Kan baay’ee barbaachisaa ta’e
That’s how good it is that day.	Guyyaa sana akkasitti gaarii dha.
I just can't buy that	Ani sana qofa bitachuu hin danda'u
When you think about it, it’s not a big deal.	Yeroo itti yaaddu waan guddaa miti.
I know you’re in here.	As keessa akka jirtu nan beeka.
Just one of his moments, now.	Yeroo isaa keessaa tokko qofa, amma.
It was just that part.	Kutaa sana qofa ture.
But I won't tell him	Ani garuu itti hin himu
He has a funny sense of humor	Miira qoosaa qoosaa qaba
I think everyone pretty much came around.	Namni hundi baay'ee naannoo sana dhufe jedheen yaada.
He had friends and a good reputation	Hiriyyoota fi maqaa gaarii qaba ture
I mean, it really doesn’t matter	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabu jechuu kooti
I'm on it.	Ani isa irra jira.
It did me good.	Gaarii naaf godhe.
You could see right then.	Yeroo sanatti sirriitti arguu dandeessa turte.
I thought we were in this together	Kana keessa waliin jirra jedheen yaade
It's becoming more than me.	Na caalaa ta'aa jira.
I can't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin danda'u.
Just that one voice all night.	Halkan guutuu sagalee tokko sana qofa.
You know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e beekta.
It's the right time.	Yeroo sirrii ta'e.
I have two things for you	Waan lama siif qaba
Wait, maybe that was last year.	Eegaa tarii sun bara darbe ta'uu danda'a.
They were already right there with him.	Isaan duruu sirriitti isa waliin turan.
I hope someone can help me.	Namni tokko na gargaaruu akka danda'u abdiin qaba.
He can't have it.	Inni qabaachuu hin danda'u.
It seemed like the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ta'e fakkaata ture.
We are no different from you.	Nuti isin irraa adda miti.
I could always know with her	Yeroo hundumaa ishee wajjin beekuu nan dandaʼa ture
But this time, he thought, was different.	Yeroon kun garuu adda ture jedhee yaade.
Lots and lots of sleep.	Hirriba baay'ee fi baay'ee.
You weren’t here.	Ati as hin turre.
At the time, I think this is a good thing	Yeroo sanatti kun waan gaarii natti fakkaata
We are not like that.	Nuti akkas miti.
I didn’t notice any problems.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin hubanne.
This could be my chance.	Kun carraa koo ta’uu danda’a.
She couldn’t find her car	Konkolaataa ishee argachuu hin dandeenye
I wasn’t that into that	Ani akkasitti hin turre sana keessa hin turre
I can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
They need to go.	Deemuun isaan barbaachisa.
I didn’t know where to go or what to do	Eessa akkan deemu fi maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I have been watching them a lot.	Baay'ee isaan ilaalaa tureera.
I know what you are going through.	Waan keessa jirtu nan beeka.
I was right, that was bad.	Ani sirrii ture, sun hamaa ture.
It would have been him.	Silaa isa ta'a.
He’s not the only one.	Inni qofa miti.
I'd rather have it on where it belongs	Bakka itti ta'u irratti qabaachuu naaf wayya
I have no idea how it works	Akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu
We're looking at it.	Itti ilaalaa jirra.
I think this is very likely.	Kun baay’ee kan hin oolle natti fakkaata.
I had no luck there either	Anis achi irratti carraa hin qabu ture
I know who you really are	Dhuguma eenyu akka taate nan beeka
I think she did the best she could.	Waan dandeessu hunda goote jedheen yaada.
It doesn't matter what happened.	Waan ta'e homaa hin qabu.
They want people with many interests.	Namoota fedhii hedduu qaban barbaadu.
I didn’t know where that thing was going.	Wanti sun eessa akka deemu hin beeku ture.
I know this now.	Kana amma beeka.
I wouldn’t intend to do that either	Anis akkas gochuuf hin yaadu ture
I didn’t know what to do with them	Maal akkan isaan godhu hin beeku ture
I hardly saw my friends	Hiriyyoota koo baayʼee natti hin argine
Now, what time is it again?.	Amma, ammas sa'aatii meeqa?.
I have a lot of work to do	Hojii baay'een qaba
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
But it went by so quickly	Garuu akkas dafee darbe
He wanted to stay.	Turuu barbaade.
But as lucky as I am.	Garuu akkuma carraa kooti.
I love the area.	Naannoo sana nan jaalladha.
He said there was no time.	Yeroon hin jiru jedhe.
I didn't want to be with them	Isaan waliin ta'uu hin barbaanne
I didn’t know it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti hin beeku ture.
I hope it is going to be a good job.	Hojii gaarii ta'uuf akka jiru abdiin qaba.
I'm really sorry.	Dhuguma dhiifama.
I was just better than you	Ani si caalaa qofa ture
I need him so much.	Baay'ee isa barbaada.
I want it to be a part of me	Kutaa koo akka ta'u nan barbaada
You certainly weren’t.	Ati akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I was right there.	Ani sirriitti achi ture.
Anyone else have this problem?.	Namni biraa rakkoo kana qabu jiraa?.
He was there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi ture.
I don’t need your help anymore	Kana booda gargaarsa keessan hin barbaadu
There was still time.	Ammas yeroon ture.
Sometimes you have to work at it.	Yeroo tokko tokko itti hojjechuu qabda.
I wanted to do all of that	Sana hunda gochuun barbaade
This time I saw a car, but a different car.	Yeroo kana konkolaataa arge, garuu konkolaataa adda ta'e.
They say more to us.	Caalaatti nuuf jedhu.
She's a must.	Isheen dirqama.
I couldn't believe it was him.	Isa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye.
Only children.	Ijoollee qofa.
He didn’t do anything to the guy	Gurbaa sana homaa hin goone
Luckily for us that doesn't mean much.	Carraa nuuf ta'e sun waan baay'ee jechuu miti.
I just can't believe it happened	Akka ta'e qofa amanuu hin danda'u
I know she loves seeing you	Isheen si arguu akka jaallattu nan beeka
She was right, of course.	Isheen sirrii akka turte beekamaadha.
A little money	Maallaqa xiqqoo
Up to three.	Hanga sadii.
I knew she would love that part	Kutaa sana akka jaallattu nan beeka ture
But it isn’t.	Garuu miti.
Did a bit of this and that.	Xiqqoo kanaa fi sana hojjete.
The past had no place in his life now.	Kan darbe amma jireenya isaa keessatti bakka hin qabu ture.
I think it was pretty cool though	Baayyee namatti tola ture natti fakkaata garuu
One of them is yours, one is mine.	Isaan keessaa tokko kan kee, tokko kan kooti.
All of them.	Hundi isaanii.
Just an idea, you know.	Yaada qofa, beekta.
She was very nice.	Isheen baayʼee namatti tola turte.
Everything else works fine.	Wanti biraa hundi akka gaariitti hojjeta.
He gave it a great deal of thought	Yaada guddaa itti kenne
You can never do enough.	Gonkumaa gahaa hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
But you know this.	Ati garuu kana beekta.
What should I do?.	Maal gochuu qaba?.
You have our man.	Nama keenya qabda.
To make the day yours.	Guyyaa sana kan keessan gochuuf.
I didn’t want to answer it	Deebii itti kennuu hin barbaanne
It is very, very important.	Baayyee baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
I know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
But not right now.	Garuu yeroo ammaa miti.
So they never had to comment on it.	Kanaaf gonkumaa yaada irratti kennuu hin qaban turan.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
I've been waiting for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf eegaa jira
Two in one.	Tokko keessatti lama.
I don't mean to yell	Iyyuu jechuu koo miti
Maybe I should go home.	Tarii gara manaatti deebi'uu qaba.
Man walking a small dog.	Namni saree xiqqoo tokko deemaa jiru.
I would never have thought of that	Silaa gonkumaa akkas hin yaadu ture
It doesn't have to be.	Dirqama ta'uu hin qabu.
I wanted to be hers	Kan ishee ta'uu barbaade
I didn’t want to eat it	Nyaachuu hin barbaanne
He may account for some of this.	Kana keessaa muraasa isaa sababa taʼuu dandaʼa.
Everything goes well for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deema.
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
He knew exactly what was happening	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeka ture
I don't understand something.	Waan tokko naaf hin galle.
That’s really important.	Sun dhuguma barbaachisaa dha.
She's got me.	Isheen na qabdi.
Things were not good in those days.	Bara sana wanti gaarii hin turre.
That’s very possible.	Sun baay’ee ni danda’ama.
I really wanted to be with you	Si waliin ta'uu baay'een barbaade
He wasn’t there.	Inni hin jiru ture.
She just had to ask.	Gaafachuu qofa qabdi turte.
Very important part of you	Kutaa keessan baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e
He said, "Come back.	Deebi'i jedhe.
I thought it was really good	Dhuguma gaarii ta'ee natti fakkaate
I was no better than him	Ani isa caalaa hin turre
He should have known it would happen	Silaa akka ta'u beekuu qaba ture
Everyone wanted to know who did it.	Namni hundi eenyu akka godhe beekuu barbaade.
Not her outfit of the day.	Uffata ishee guyyaa sanaa miti.
That’s absolutely it.	Sun guutummaatti.
I loved doing that kind of thing	Waan akkasii hojjechuu nan jaalladha ture
It's not just about us.	Waa'ee keenya qofa miti.
But then he didn't want to.	Sana booda garuu hin barbaanne.
Just the two of us.	Nu lamaan qofa.
It's not about this.	Waa'ee kanaa miti.
Maybe not anymore, not like before.	Tarii kana booda miti, akka durii miti.
I think I can do it this time	Yeroo kanaan waanan danda'u natti fakkaata
You hold me there for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf achitti na qabda.
This can’t last long	Kun yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda’u
I would have been with them.	Silaa isaan waliin ture.
Nothing against her.	Homaa ishee irratti hin jiru.
I can't help you, now, but much later	Si gargaaruu hin danda'u, amma, garuu baay'ee booda
I don’t know why he’s there.	Maaliif akka inni jiru hin beeku.
Mostly simple things.	Irra caalaa wantoota salphaa.
I would never have thought of it	Silaa gonkumaa hin yaadu ture
They have to come.	Isaan dhufuu qabu.
I will say this much	Hamma kana nan jedha
I partied a lot.	Baay'een affeerraa godhe.
It must be returned	Deebi'uu qaba
He has been there.	Inni achi tureera.
I was waiting.	Ani eegaa ture.
I’m really happy with that.	Dhuguma sanatti gammadeera.
It's working now.	Amma hojjechaa jira.
He is currently in school	Yeroo ammaa mana barumsaa jira
I’m not up to it.	Ani hanga isaa hin jiru.
That wasn’t enough.	Sun gahaa hin turre.
He thought she would be fine.	Isheen gaarii ta'a jedhee yaade.
It’s just a question of when.	Gaaffii yoom jedhu qofa.
This really, really works.	Kun dhuguma, dhuguma ni hojjeta.
That, of course, is yours.	Sun, kan kee akka ta’e beekamaadha.
He asked what we had.	Maal qabna jedhee gaafate.
Without work.	Hojii malee.
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
And it’s not like that anymore.	Ammas akkas miti.
He knew it so well.	Inni akka malee beeka ture.
A very different time	Yeroo baayyee adda ta'e
A lot is happening right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waan baay'ee ta'aa jira
Where she was working at the time.	Bakka yeroo sana hojjechaa turte.
Husband and wife.	Abbaa manaa fi haadha manaa.
Like a mother like a daughter.	Akka haadha akka intala.
I wanted to ask a favor	Tola tokko gaafachuu barbaade
Clearly there is something to this.	Kana keessa waan tokko akka jiru ifaadha.
I can do a little of that, but not a whole lot.	Xiqqoo sana gochuu nan danda'a, garuu baay'ee guutuu miti.
A very serious situation	Haala baayyee hamaa ta'e
No one really stands out	Dhuguma namni adda ta'e hin jiru
Clearly, this was no such time.	Yeroon kun yeroo akkasii akka hin turre ifaadha.
People shouldn't be out of work that much.	Namoonni hangas hojii ala ta'uu hin qaban.
I didn’t know you were here	As akka jirtu hin beeku ture
I would never have been able to play like her	Silaa akka ishee taphachuu gonkumaa hin danda'u ture
A man of simple interests	Nama fedhii salphaa qabu
He still hadn't caught her.	Ammas ishee hin qabne ture.
I didn’t see how it started	Akkamitti akka jalqabe hin argine
Which is a problem.	Kan rakkoo ta'e.
Nothing else is going on.	Wanti biraa deemaa jiru hin jiru.
It was nothing like here.	Akka asitti homaa hin turre.
I don’t want that anymore	Kana booda sana hin barbaadu
Boy, they were wrong.	Gurbaa, dogoggora turan.
He should have stayed in that position	Silaa bakka sana turuu qaba ture
Right here.	Sirriitti asitti.
I can't come right now	Yeroo ammaa dhufuu hin danda'u
I really didn’t know what to do	Dhuguma maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
It was the best we could do.	Inni hunda caalaa nuti gochuu dandeenyu ture.
This was what you would do.	Kun waan ati gootu ture.
I will do that.	Akkas nan godha.
I wasn't sure before	Kanaan dura mirkanaa'aa hin turre
It was pretty bad this morning.	Ganama kana baayyee hamaa ture.
Enough.	Gahaa.
I can't believe anyone would do that	Namni akkas godha jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
We did the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjenne.
We are not the people who made them.	Nuti namoota isaan hojjete miti.
Maybe one of them saw something.	Tarii isaan keessaa tokko waan tokko arge ta'a.
It really has to work on my hands	Dhuguma harka koo irratti hojjechuu qaba
It was something he didn’t understand.	Waan inni hin hubanne ture.
But the problem is that we have a bigger picture here.	Garuu rakkoon jiru asitti suuraa guddaa qabna.
I knew what this was	Kun maal akka taʼe nan beeka ture
He isn’t. 	Inni miti. 
They are not the same thing.	Isaan waan tokko miti.
I only saw a couple of them in my time.	Yeroo kootti isaan keessaa tokko lama qofa arge.
Wrong.	Dogoggora.
Which is pretty good.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e.
That works well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Nothing is too good for us.	Wanti garmalee nuuf gaarii ta'e hin jiru.
She is a good disaster.	Isheen balaa gaarii dha.
That’s not the same thing.	Sun waan tokko miti.
Wait for him.	Isa eegaa.
He looked so smooth out there.	Inni achi keessaa akka malee sirriitti fakkaata ture.
But this was easier said than done.	Garuu kun dubbachuu caalaa gochuu caalaa salphaa ture.
He’s going to do great things later	Booda waan guddaa hojjechuuf deema
But she wouldn’t.	Garuu hin gootu turte.
I wanted to know more	Caalaatti beekuu barbaade
That’s all one thing.	Sun hundi waan tokko.
I mean, no one is.	Namni tokkollee hin jiru jechuu kooti.
I like doing that.	Sana gochuun natti tola.
I don't mean that.	Ani akkas jechuu koo miti.
I knew it could only be one thing.	Waan tokko qofa ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka ture.
That’s just wrong.	Sun dogoggora qofa.
It has to be something you are willing to do.	Waan ati gochuuf fedhii qabdu ta'uu qaba.
I wanted to tell him so much more.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee itti himuu barbaade.
I didn’t see anything that looked out of place.	Waan bakka hin qabne fakkaatu hin argine.
You don't have to be like them.	Ati akka isaanii ta'uu hin qabdu.
I want someone to tell me what to do	Namni maal akkan godhu akka natti himu nan barbaada
It’s on them.	Isaan irra jira.
I didn’t think she needed to go there	Achi deemuun waan ishee barbaachisu natti hin fakkaatu ture
He still matters in their thoughts.	Inni amma iyyuu yaada isaanii keessatti dhimma qaba.
I think he's a good guy	Gurbaa gaarii natti fakkaata
I know you have questions	Gaaffii akka qabdu nan beeka
He shouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture.
That was a lot of work.	Sun hojii guddaa ture.
A real man.	Nama dhugaa.
Didn't need much else.	Waan biraa baay'ee hin barbaachifne.
You don’t have to go, you know.	Deemuun dirqama miti, beekta.
She has no place.	Bakka hin qabdu.
I didn't need a very large room	Kutaa baayyee guddaa ta'e na hin barbaachisu ture
He said there were three of them.	Isaan keessaa sadii akka turan jedhe.
He asked if anyone wanted to go back.	Namni duubatti deebi'uu barbaadu jiraa jedhee gaafate.
I almost love him so much	Baay'een isa jaalladha jechuun ni danda'ama
He is on his way now.	Amma karaa irra jira.
I didn't want to be unsure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa akka hin taane hin barbaanne.
That's how everything went!!!.	Wanti hundi akkasitti deeme!!!.
I never saw him again	Kana booda isa hin argine
I'm the only one.	Ani qofa.
I really don't know why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I don’t know what else to do with them.	Kana biraa maal akkan isaan godhu hin beeku.
It’s just a matter of time.	Yeroo qofa.
I think it looks pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata jedheen yaada.
I have been watching it almost every night	Halkan hunda jechuun ni danda'ama ilaalaa tureera
I know what’s up there	Waan achi ol jiru nan beeka
I’m not there yet.	Ani ammallee achi hin jiru.
Only a few, though.	Muraasa qofa garuu.
He always knows what to do.	Yeroo hundumaa waan godhu ni beeka.
He wanted them, all the time	Isaan barbaada ture, yeroo hunda
I shouldn't have told you any of this	Waan kana keessaa tokkollee sitti himuu hin qabu ture
This was not the case.	Kun akkas hin turre.
I still have a lot to offer.	Ammallee waan baay'ee qaba.
I know we are different	Adda akka taane nan beeka
Then again, probably not a good idea.	Sana booda ammas, tarii yaada gaarii miti.
He has a big mouth.	Afaan guddaa qaba.
He thought it would never come.	Yoomiyyuu hin dhufuu jedhee yaade.
I just can't get it today	Har'a qofa argachuu hin danda'u
We had to have your help.	Gargaarsa keessan qabaachuu qabna turre.
But I didn't tell him that	Ani garuu akkas itti hin himne
I just didn't know how to do that.	Akkamitti akkas akka ta'u qofa hin beeku ture.
It doesn’t mean he doesn’t love his mother.	Haadha isaa hin jaallatu jechuu miti.
I hadn’t noticed when he did	Yeroo inni akkas godhu hin hubanne ture
I have many thoughts on this.	Kana irratti yaada hedduu qaba.
I want to work on myself	Ofii koo irratti hojjechuu barbaada
I was not interested in their work	Ani hojii isaanii kanaaf fedhii hin qabu ture
I told him it was out of the question	Gaaffii keessaa akka ba'e itti hime
I hoped he knew what he was doing	Waan hojjetu akka beeku abdiin qaba ture
I started to back away	Anis duubatti deebi'uu jalqabe
It looked like that.	Akkas fakkaata ture.
That she now knows.	Akka isheen amma beektu.
No one understood him.	Namni isa hubate hin jiru.
I think this is a mistake.	Kun dogoggora natti fakkaata.
He couldn't say why	Maaliif jechuu hin danda'u ture
Not at all, he told her.	Tasumaa miti jedhee itti hime.
You are the only one.	Ati tokko qofa.
This is neither good nor bad.	Kun gaarii fi hamaa miti.
This is going great.	Kun guddaa deemaa jira.
It just seemed right.	Waan sirrii ta'e qofa fakkaata ture.
But that doesn’t mean it’s completely in the clear.	Garuu guutummaatti ifa keessa jira jechuu miti.
I said it would be you	Si ta'a jedheen
And I just didn’t want to believe it	Anis amanuu qofa hin barbaanne
But he says so little.	Garuu akkas xiqqoo dubbata.
I was just playing around	Ani taphachuu qofa ture
I just like doing it	Hojjechuu qofa natti tola
Very little.	Baayyee xiqqoo.
It was the right picture.	Suuraa sirrii ture.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Ani garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t know what he wanted	Waan inni barbaadu hin beeku ture
I couldn't leave you	Si dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I knew someone had to know something	Namni tokko waan tokko beekuu akka qabu nan beeka ture
I know everyone loves to comment.	Namni hundi yaada kennuu akka jaallatu nan beeka.
I wouldn’t want it if it wasn’t	Osoo hin taane hin barbaadu ture
I am that person.	Ani nama sana.
I don't understand.	Naaf hin galle.
It has a room.	Kutaa qaba.
They are becoming themselves.	Of ta'aa jiru.
I love the sound of it though	Sagalee isaa garuu nan jaalladha
I can't say anything about that	Waa'ee sanaa homaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
I didn't think about it	Anis itti hin yaadne
I can't say anything yet	Hanga ammaatti homaa jechuu hin danda'u
He wants to believe in himself	Ofitti amanuu barbaada
If not for a long time after that.	Sana booda yeroo dheeraaf yoo hin taane.
I know you will.	Akka gootu nan beeka.
But she didn’t want that.	Garuu isheen akkas hin barbaaddu turte.
Another little girl, maybe.	Intala xiqqoo kan biraa, tarii.
He’s got me.	Inni na qaba.
I didn’t realize she looked like that	Akkas akka ishee fakkaattu hin hubanne
That all works out.	Sun hundi ni hojjeta.
I, of course, was constantly staring at her	Ani, yeroo hunda ija keessa ishee ilaalaa akkan ture beekamaadha
I didn't know about you	Waa'ee kee hin beeku ture
He really knew her.	Inni dhuguma ishee beeka ture.
This is a mistake, but it is not a new mistake.	Kun dogoggora, garuu dogoggora haaraa miti.
It may be late.	Yeroo booda ta'uu danda'a.
He didn't say anything more, but he didn't.	Kana caalaa homaa hin dubbanne, garuu hin dubbanne.
It will be really good.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'a.
No more is needed.	Kana caalaa hin barbaachisu.
Good luck with that.	Kanaaf carraa gaarii.
He certainly knew that.	Inni dhuguma sana beeka ture.
She has to come back.	Deebi'uu qabdi.
He really, really had.	Inni dhuguma, dhuguma qaba ture.
Not that he would ever do such a thing.	Waan akkasii yoomiyyuu ni hojjeta jechuu miti.
But we don’t really need a drink.	Garuu dhugaatii dhuguma nu hin barbaachisu.
I know everything about you	Waa'ee kee waan hundumaa nan beeka
I don't, but so what.	Ani hin qabu, garuu kanaaf maal.
We can't go back anymore.	Kana booda duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
That’s the problem with you.	Rakkoon si waliin jiru kanuma.
I knew what we both needed	Lamaan keenyayyuu maal akka nu barbaachisu nan beeka ture
I didn’t mean to do that terrible thing	Waan hamaa sana hojjechuuf hin yaadne
But it was only for a while.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa ture.
Then we saw this.	Sana booda kana argine.
Obviously he could never do that.	Inni gonkumaa akkas gochuu akka hin dandeenye ifaadha.
But that may not be the case.	Garuu akkas ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Later in the year.	Booda waggaa keessa.
I thought he might be able to help you	Inni si gargaaruu danda'a jedheen yaade
He was much older.	Inni baayyee umuriin isaa guddaa ture.
Three.	Sadii.
It might be a little longer	Xiqqoo dheeraa ta'uu danda'a
But you have to do something.	Garuu waan hojjechuu qabda.
You can’t get anything from me.	Ana irraa homaa argachuu hin dandeessu.
I didn’t know what to do with myself	Waan ofitti godhu hin beeku ture
But he is not like us.	Inni garuu akka keenya miti.
But then it happens.	Garuu sana booda ni ta'a.
Except for one place.	Bakka tokko malee.
I wasn’t alone in the room	Kutaa keessa kophaa koo hin turre
Now he has a lot of money	Amma qarshii baay'ee qaba
I will go with them.	Isaan waliin nan deema.
I know this feeling all too well	Miira kana sirriitti beeka
There is no time.	Yeroon hin jiru.
I think you know where it is	Eessa akka ta'e waan beektu natti fakkaata
But he couldn't do anything.	Garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I think this is what you want.	Kan ati barbaaddu kana natti fakkaata.
This is not a very simple question.	Kun gaaffii baayyee salphaa miti.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
Not in this, he thought.	Kana keessa miti jedhee yaade.
He was here, he was there, he was everywhere.	Inni as ture, achi ture, bakka hunda ture.
I’m glad it went quickly	Dafee deemuu isaatti gammadeera
I don’t know what worked.	Wanti hojjete hin beeku.
He thought only of himself.	Of qofa yaade.
No one went up there.	Namni achi ol ba'e hin jiru.
I want to get that money	Maallaqa sana argachuu nan barbaada
Then he knows the answer.	Sana booda deebii isaa ni beeka.
I hope it happens again	Ammas akka ta'u abdiin qaba
Full name of the character.	Maqaa guutuu.
I was there for a while, just waiting	Yeroo muraasaaf achi ture, eegaa qofa
It was her time.	Yeroon ishee ture.
Usually you don't need any help.	Yeroo baayyee gargaarsa tokkollee hin barbaaddu.
I hope he found you well	Akka gaariitti akka si argate abdiin qaba
It can last for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf turuu danda’a.
Now they had it bad.	Amma hamaa qaban turan.
I still had a lot, in those days	Ammallee baay'een qaba ture, bara sanatti
I have no jobs and no hope	Hojii fi abdii hin qabu
That can be very important.	Sun baayʼee barbaachisaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I thought it would be good	Gaarii ta'a jedheen yaade
I am fully aware of that	Sana guutummaatti beeka
I couldn’t do anything else.	Waan biraa gochuu hin dandeenye.
Of course, some of this is somewhat positive.	Kun tokko tokko hanga tokko gaarii akka taʼe beekamaadha.
It’s not really my business.	Dhuguma dhimma koo miti.
I wondered what they were doing	Maal gochaa jiru jedheen yaade
It wasn’t easy.	Salphaa hin turre.
I think it's about time.	Waa'ee yeroo natti fakkaata.
He was really doing this	Dhuguma kana gochaa ture
Knowing where it’s going, where things are.	Eessa akka deemu, wanti eessa akka jiru beekuu.
I think we need to know more about it	Waa'ee isaa caalaatti beekuu qabna jedheen yaada
I want you to think about that	Sana irratti akka yaaddu nan barbaada
That’s where he is.	Bakka inni jiru kanuma.
He should be clear on that	Sana irratti ifa ta'uu qaba
Maybe that was the case in life.	Tarii jireenya keessatti akkas ture ta'a.
And I just couldn’t see it.	Anis arguu hin dandeenye qofa.
I told him something but it wasn’t true	Ani waan tokko itti hime malee dhugaa hin taane
Excessive talking.	Garmalee dubbachuu.
I can go all the way too	Anis karaa hundumaa deemuu dandaʼa
I know what to do about that.	Waa'ee sanaa maal akkan godhu nan beeka.
But now it was nothing.	Amma garuu homaa hin turre.
Maybe it's because of him.	Tarii sababa isaatiin ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t need a job	Hojiin na hin barbaachisu ture
I want to do that again	Ammas akkas gochuu nan barbaada
I haven't seen any emotion from her yet	Hanga ammaatti miira tokkollee ishee irraa hin argine
A week later we were together again	Torban tokko booda ammas waliin turre
It worked really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjete.
I can do without it	Isa malee gochuu nan danda'a
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin turre.
It wasn’t him.	Isa hin turre ture.
That doesn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu.
Two weeks ago	Torban lama dura
I didn't see him.	Ani isa hin argine.
Maybe someone lives at home.	Tarii namni tokko mana jiraata ta'a.
Please help.	Mee gargaaru.
This can be a very long night.	Kun halkan baayyee dheeraa ta'uu danda'a.
But it was then.	Garuu yeroo sana ture.
He has two children.	Ijoollee lama qaba.
I didn't know much about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan baay'ee hin beeku ture.
I knew something was wrong	Waan tokko akka dogoggora ta'e nan beeka ture
No one else can do this for you.	Namni biraa kana siif gochuu hin danda'u.
I want you to know that you are not alone	Ati kophaa kee akka hin taane akka beektu nan barbaada
He’s not interested in me not now.	Inni naaf fedhii hin qabu amma miti.
He wanted to see her later	Booda ishee arguu barbaade
I may see you this coming week	Torban dhufu kana si arguu danda'a
Everything is right.	Wanti hundi sirrii dha.
He was right, of course.	Sirrii akka ture beekamaadha.
I knew what it was like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture
I have become a mother	Ani haadha ta'ee jira
He gave him everything he needed	Waan isa barbaachisu hunda isaaf kenne
This doesn't work.	Kun hin hojjetu.
It’s not a chance.	Carraa miti.
He doesn't seem to have given anything.	Waan waan kenne hin fakkaatu.
Not so, mother.	Akkas miti haadha.
I thought he did a good job	Hojii gaarii hojjete natti fakkaate
That’s how it’s always been.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
I haven't seen that.	Ani akkas hin argine.
He wasn't much of a bartender.	Inni nama mana dhugaatii baay'ee hin turre.
It’s not for kids.	Kan ijoollee miti.
I just really love you	Dhuguma si jaalladha qofa
There must be something else you can do.	Wanti biraa ati gochuu dandeessu jiraachuu qaba.
I doubt he's right.	Sirrii akka ta'e nan shakka.
He had known them for a long time, he thought.	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan beeka ture jedhee yaade.
I don’t really have a reason.	Dhuguma sababa hin qabu.
I can't live with you	Si waliin jiraachuu hin danda'u
They were very nice to us.	Isaan baay'ee nutti tola turan.
But I have to admit it	Ani garuu amanuu qaba
I didn’t want that moment	Yeroo sana hin barbaanne
But now he has nothing.	Amma garuu homaa hin qabu.
I don't know if this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa hin beeku.
I didn’t want to go, it wasn’t my idea	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne, yaada koo miti
He was no longer in my room	Kana booda kutaa koo keessa hin turre
They do worse than nothing.	Homaa hin taane caalaa hamaa hojjetu.
Better than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa wayya.
I don’t need any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee na hin barbaachisu.
I couldn’t see an answer in that	Sana keessatti deebii arguu hin dandeenye
But tomorrow night.	Garuu boru halkan.
It’s pretty big, right.	Baayyee guddaa dha, sirrii dha.
He wanted to know everything	Waan hundumaa beekuu barbaade
He was very happy.	Baayʼee gammade.
I was looking to do something different.	Ani garuu waan adda taʼe hojjechuuf barbaadaa ture.
Everything you need.	Waan isin barbaachisu hunda.
It is no longer needed.	Kana booda hin barbaachisu.
I thought it was just time	Yeroon isaa qofa natti fakkaate
This is our school.	Kun mana barumsaa keenya.
I didn't see her.	Ishee hin argine.
All of you.	Hundi keessan.
She was nothing.	Isheen homaa hin turre.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It’s not just what’s coming, really.	Waan dhufu qofa miti, dhuguma.
It was no small thing	Waan xiqqoo hin turre
Last year was something different.	Bara darbe waan adda ta'e ture.
Maybe she has it.	Tarii qabdi ta'a.
A little chance, but better than never.	Carraa xiqqoo, garuu tasumaa hin taane caalaa gaarii.
I'm still not going	Ammallee hin deemu
Be a good guy.	Gaarii ta'aa.
I wanted those things.	Wantoota sana nan barbaada ture.
Two weeks, no early remission.	Torban lama, dafee dhiifama hin qabu.
I think it's a new picture	Suuraa haaraa natti fakkaata
He had one just like him	Tokko akkuma isaa qaba ture
You can still be together.	Ammas waliin ta'uu dandeessu.
Just good, really good.	Gaarii qofa, dhuguma gaarii dha.
And I said that of course.	Anis akkas jedheen beekamaadha.
I knew he wasn’t so lucky	Akkas carraa akka hin qabne nan beeka ture
But then it would be another book, not this one.	Garuu sana booda kitaaba kana osoo hin taane kan biraa ta'a ture.
See everything with me.	Waan hundumaa na waliin ilaalaa.
But that will be tomorrow.	Sun garuu boru ta'a.
But I can't find him.	Ani garuu isa argachuu hin danda'u.
I looked around again	Ammas naannoo koo ilaale
I want to buy a car.	Konkolaataa bitachuu nan barbaada.
I never wanted to make that kind of comment	Yaada akkasii kennuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
You are not a good person.	Ati nama gaarii miti.
Very different from me.	Ana irraa baayyee adda.
Nothing was out of place.	Wanti bakka hin qabne hin turre.
I shouldn't have said that.	Ani akkas jechuu hin qabu ture.
I was wrong, of course.	Ani dogoggora akkan ture beekamaadha.
I thought about her all the time	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee ishee nan yaada ture
I hadn't even thought that was possible	Sun ni danda'ama jedhee illee hin yaadne ture
I could ask him later	Booda isa gaafachuu nan dandaʼa ture
We had to turn back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qabna turre.
About getting to know you.	Waa'ee si beekuu.
I love when he does that	Yeroo inni akkas godhu nan jaalladha
Now it has ample space	Amma bakka bal'aa qaba
Sometimes he had it with him.	Yeroo tokko tokko of biraa qaba ture.
It wasn’t always for you	Yeroo hundumaa siif hin turre
But I want my clothes	Uffata koo garuu nan barbaada
He couldn't do that.	Akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
He must know everything	Waan hundumaa beekuu qaba
Things like that.	Wantoota akkasii.
Never a good idea.	Gonkumaa yaada gaarii miti.
I will never be alone again	Kana booda yoomiyyuu kophaa koo hin ta'u
It is unclear why he did not do so.	Maaliif akkas akka hin goone ifa miti.
I couldn’t ask him to come	Akka dhufu isa gaafachuu hin dandeenye
That’s what he had told himself.	Kanuma ofitti hime ture.
He is now in good shape.	Amma haala gaarii irra jira.
I knew I shouldn’t have left you there alone	Silaa achitti kophaa si dhiisuu akka hin qabne nan beeka ture
I never know what to say.	Waan jedhu gonkumaa hin beeku.
I mean, he had a wife and a daughter	Haadha manaa fi intala qaba ture jechuu kooti
No one has done this before.	Kana dura namni kana godhe hin jiru.
I said it was easy.	Salphaa jedheen.
Time has no name.	Yeroon maqaa hin qabu.
I was one of them.	Ani isaan keessaa tokko ture.
If you are truthful.	Yoo dhugaa taate.
I hope it helps someone.	Nama tokko akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I really didn’t quite know what to say	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu sirriitti hin beeku ture
I think that’s everything	Waan hunda kanuma natti fakkaata
This is not like you.	Kun akka kee miti.
One hour, two hours, three hours.	Sa'aatii tokko, sa'aatii lama, sa'aatii sadii.
I think they all do	Hundi isaanii ni godhu jedheen yaada
He worked with everything.	Waan hundumaa waliin hojjete.
I know this about him.	Waa'ee isaa kana nan beeka.
I mean, I really looked at him.	Dhuguma isa ilaale jechuu kooti.
This has always been the case.	Yeroo hundumaa kana ture.
I think you're right.	Ati sirrii natti fakkaata.
I want to do something like that.	Waan akkasii hojjechuu nan barbaada.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
We have a problem.	Rakkoo qabna.
Just a little bit though.	Xiqqoo qofa garuu.
I couldn’t live without her	Ishee malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye
People still love him.	Namoonni amma iyyuu isa jaallatu.
He must eat it.	Nyaachuu qaba.
I thought we got along really well	Dhuguma akka gaariitti walii galle natti fakkaate
I love children.	Ijoollee nan jaalladha.
It’s okay to say I don’t understand.	Naaf hin galle jechuun homaa miti.
That’s my mom with us kids.	Sun haadha koo nu ijoollee waliin.
I don't know what to do.	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
He didn't speak again.	Ammas hin dubbanne.
I couldn't stay here.	As turuu hin dandeenye.
No one was looking for them.	Namni isaan barbaadu hin turre.
She seems to know a few things.	Waan muraasa waan beektu fakkaata.
That sounds easy.	Sun salphaa fakkaata.
I wondered what this could be	Kun maal ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
He is not there.	Inni achi miti.
I really want to know what he was doing	Dhuguma maal hojjechaa akka ture beekuu barbaada
I don’t make a big deal out of this	Kana keessaa waan guddaa hin godhu
Now he was here.	Amma as ture.
That wasn’t my problem.	Rakkoon koo sun hin turre.
I haven't told you about them yet	Waa'ee isaanii hanga ammaatti sitti hin himne
He wants you all your size	Hamma kee hunda si barbaada
No one saw her outside.	Namni ala ishee arge hin jiru.
For his own sake.	Isaaf jedhee.
But there is some hope.	Garuu abdiin tokko tokko jira.
But he will be different.	Inni garuu adda ta'a.
I wasn’t really interested in this idea at all	Yaada kanaaf dhuguma tasumaa fedhii hin qabu ture
Can anyone help me please.	Namni na gargaaru jiraa mee.
I just need to know it’s there	Achi akka jiru beekuu qofa na barbaachisa
She’s good at that.	Isheen sana irratti gaarii dha.
You know it's always going to happen.	Yeroo hundumaa akka ta'u ni beekta.
He wants to talk to you.	Inni sitti dubbachuu barbaada.
I should have told him earlier	Silaa kanaan dura itti himuu qaba ture
I could have gone back	Silaa duubatti deebi'uu nan danda'a ture
I knew nothing about it	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture
Not this year.	Bara kana miti.
Glad to see you here.	Asitti si arguu kootti gammadeera.
I can do that, you know	Ani akkas gochuu nan danda'a, beekta
They know it's a mistake.	Dogoggora akka ta'e ni beeku.
He wanted to be someone else	Nama biraa ta'uu barbaade
He has a lot of things to do	Waan hojjechuu qabu baay'ee qaba
I think about the other night, like, all the time	Waa'ee halkan biraa nan yaada, akka, yeroo hundumaa
We agreed it was an important issue.	Dhimma barbaachisaa ta'uu isaa irratti walii galle.
I always have this.	Yeroo hundumaa kana qaba.
I'm not so sure this is the case	Kun akka ta'e hangas mirkanaa'aa miti
It took us all day.	Guyyaa guutuu nu fudhate.
I will do nothing without you	Si malee homaa hin godhu
I know what was going on in there	Waan achi keessa ta'aa ture nan beeka
I mean, she was there	Achi turte jechuu kooti
None of that works anymore.	Sana keessaa tokkollee kana booda hin hojjetu.
Nothing, he thought.	Homaa miti jedhee yaade.
Later that morning.	Booda ganama sana.
I was watching him today	Har'a isa ilaalaa ture
Look at who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e ilaalaa.
This worked very well.	Kun baayyee gaarii hojjete.
But look at the crowd.	Garuu namoota baay'ee ilaalaa.
I should never have left her alone.	Silaa gonkumaa kophaa ishee dhiisuu hin qabu ture.
I can talk about everything	Waan hundumaa dubbachuu nan danda'a
I didn’t feel good about myself	Ofitti miira gaarii hin qabu ture
You can go.	Deemtu dandeessa.
I knew there was something in you	Si keessa waan tokko akka jiru nan beeka ture
I often think that.	Yeroo baay'ee akkas jedheen yaada.
She wasn’t interested.	Isheen fedhii hin qabdu turte.
I wonder where they are going	Eessa deemaa jiru jedheen yaada
you have to give up.	dhiisuu qabda.
I really enjoyed this book	Kitaaba kana baay'een gammadeera
I didn't talk to anyone	Nama waliin hin dubbanne
I should have told you earlier	Silaa kana dura sitti himuu qaba ture
I knew we had to do something	Waan gochuu akka qabnu nan beeka ture
I have been trying to do this	Kana gochuuf yaalaa tureera
I thought you should know	Beekuu qabda jedheen yaade
I still can't believe they're the same thing	Ammallee waan tokko ta'uu isaanii amanuu hin danda'u
It may not go away for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf deemuu dhiisuu danda'a
They just want something different.	Waan adda ta'e qofa barbaadu.
he asked himself	jedhee of gaafate
So he gave me a year.	Kanaaf waggaa tokko naaf kenne.
So many of them will be.	Kanaaf baay'een isaanii ni ta'u.
This one will be easy.	Inni kun salphaa ta'a.
Later of the.	Booda of kan.
I could go to my room	Gara kutaa kootti deemuu nan dandaʼa ture
I didn't see him around much after that.	Sana booda baay'ee naannoo isaa hin argine.
He did a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjete.
I think it should be.	Ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
I think he’s a dangerous man	Inni nama balaa guddaa qabu natti fakkaata
I can't say exactly what	Sirriitti maal jechuu hin danda'u
Usually for us	Yeroo baay'ee nuuf
I don't need anything.	Homaa na hin barbaachisu.
I wonder who looked at our costumes	Eenyutu nuti uffata keenya ilaale jedheen yaada
I didn't want to ask you a question	Gaaffii si gaafachuu hin barbaanne
I want to know	Ani beekuu barbaada
It's going now.	Amma deemaa jira.
It was good but needed a bit of work	Gaarii ture garuu hojii xiqqoo barbaada ture
It would have been much easier.	Silaa baayyee salphaa ture.
It's just not in today	Har'a qofa keessa hin jiru
We had our moments.	Yeroo keenya qabna turre.
I doubt this is the case.	Kun akkas ta'uu isaa nan shakka.
I had no idea what to say	Waan jedhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
You can tell me.	Himuu dandeessu.
He has a terrible chance	Carraa hamaa qaba
You know how he does it.	Akkamitti akka godhu ni beekta.
You don’t make me tell.	Ati akkan himu hin gootu.
But this was not the case.	Garuu kun akkas hin turre.
After a long time they were outside.	Yeroo dheeraa booda ala turan.
You don't have to be waiting for something to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf eegaa jiraachuu hin qabdu.
But that is not what happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e akkas miti.
But I can't live without books	Ani garuu kitaaba malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
I love to eat.	Nyaachuu nan jaalladha.
Except that he did.	Inni akka godhe malee.
I can't say why right now	Yeroo ammaa kana maaliif akka ta'e jechuu hin danda'u
They didn’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qaban turan.
I didn’t want him to go so badly	Ani akka malee akka inni deemu hin barbaanne
I have a lot of work to do	Hojii baay'een qaba
I doubt much will come of that.	Sana keessaa waan baay'een akka dhufu nan shakka.
I wish things weren't like this	Osoo wanti akkasitti hin taane ta'ee natti tola
No one really knows who they are anymore.	Namni kana booda dhuguma eenyu akka ta’e hin beeku.
He didn't want to know.	Beekuu hin barbaanne.
But, it’s nothing new.	Garuu, waan haaraa miti.
I mean, things are going really well	Dhuguma wanti jiru akka gaariitti deemaa jira jechuu kooti
I didn’t know what to say at the time	Yeroo sanatti maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
I couldn’t eat like that anymore	Amma booda akkas nyaachuu hin dandeenye
They say that.	Akkas jedhu.
I knew it couldn't be	Ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture
I always knew this was coming	Yeroo hundumaa kun akka dhufu nan beeka ture
I want something to happen	Wanti tokko akka ta'u nan barbaada
So you have nothing.	Kanaaf homaa hin qabdu.
More than anything, I need time	Waan hundumaa caalaa yeroon na barbaachisa
People looked different.	Namoonni adda fakkaatu turan.
I need to be forgiven	Dhiifama gochuun na barbaachisa
She had it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf qabdi turte.
You are always .	Yeroo hundumaa ati .
There was no reason for him to think otherwise.	Sababni inni waan biraa itti yaadu hin turre.
But he is good.	Garuu inni gaarii dha.
He had a place to go	Bakka itti deemu qaba ture
It’s important to him, therefore.	Isaaf barbaachisaa dha, kanaaf.
Here, that seems highly questionable.	Asitti, sun gaaffii guddaa kan qabu fakkaata.
I don’t think he told me the whole truth.	Dhugaa guutuu waan natti hime natti hin fakkaatu.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Waan ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
It’s really a good job.	Dhuguma hojii gaarii dha.
It’s in his book.	Kitaaba isaa keessa jira.
I am with you all the way	Karaa hundumaa si waliin jira
I know he wants to help.	Gargaaruu akka barbaadu nan beeka.
I would definitely go again	Ammas deemuun koo hin oolu
They are all very accurate.	Hundi isaanii baayyee sirrii dha.
I think you might be right	Sirrii ta'uu dandeessa jedheen yaada
He wanted to know who it was	Eenyu akka taʼe beekuu barbaade
It should be good.	Gaarii ta'uu qaba.
No more was needed.	Kana caalaa hin barbaachisu ture.
Now look at them.	Amma isaan ilaalaa.
I'm not exactly sure why, but I sure am	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku, garuu mirkanaa'aa dha
I didn't know many people.	Namoota baay'ee hin beeku ture.
He’s not one of his best.	Inni gaarii isaa keessaa tokko miti.
I have some questions	Gaaffii tokko tokko qaba
I'm just not sure.	Ani qofa mirkanaa'aa miti.
Not a bad feeling.	Miira hamaa hin taane.
I was so wrong about them and us	Ani waa'ee isaan fi nuti waan baay'een dogoggora ture
It’s not your business.	Dhimma kee miti.
I knew it wasn’t a new car	Konkolaataa haaraa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I am not alone in doing this	Kana kan godhu kophaa koo miti
I'm not sure that's true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
It doesn't have a sound.	Sagalee hin qabu.
You’re a problem.	Ati rakkoo.
I don't know my name	Maqaa koo hin beeku
We need to help her.	Ishee gargaaruu qabna.
I don’t think we ever will	Yoomiyyuu waan goonu natti hin fakkaatu
I wasn’t looking for any trouble	Rakkoo tokkollee barbaadaa hin turre
I didn't tell you anything	Ani homaa sitti hin himne
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
Except this one which is extremely good.	Kan garmalee gaarii ta'e kana malee.
I was already over him	Ani duruu isa irra ture
I don't have it, it wouldn't be right	Ani hin qabu, sirrii hin ta'u
I know you did that.	Akkas akka goote nan beeka.
I can't do this to you anymore	Kana booda kana si gochuu hin danda'u
There was no real answer to this.	Kanaaf deebii dhugaa hin turre.
This shouldn’t ask too much, though.	Kun garuu baay’ee gaafachuu hin qabu.
That’s just me though.	Sun garuu ana qofa.
I think it will happen very soon	Baayyee dafee ni ta'a jedheen yaada
I can't see myself with him	Isa waliin of arguu hin danda'u
A good enough name.	Maqaa gahaa gaarii.
I can't live any longer.	Kana caalaa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
That's probably why.	Kanaaf ta'uu hin oolu.
He was very good.	Inni baayyee gaarii ture.
This time maybe not.	Yeroo kana tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
I couldn’t go without him	Isa malee deemuu hin dandeenye
I’m here to help you.	Si gargaaruuf as jira.
Have a nice day people.	Guyyaa gaarii namoota.
He still didn't know what to say.	Ammas maal akka jedhu hin beekne.
I just couldn’t go.	Ani qofa deemuu hin dandeenye.
I was expecting more, much more	Kana caalaa, baay'ee caalaa eegaa ture
I started it.	Kan jalqabe ana.
He should have left him then	Silaa yeroo sana isa dhiisuu qaba ture
Some weeks a little more, some a little less.	Torban tokko tokko xiqqoo caalaa, tokko tokko xiqqoo xiqqoo.
Someone has to do it.	Namni tokko gochuu qaba.
I was very emotional at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baay'een miira keessa ture.
It’s not what it seems.	Waan fakkaatu miti.
You certainly shouldn’t ask.	Gaafachuu akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
It's a good place.	Bakka gaarii dha.
I shouldn’t have left them there	Silaa achitti isaan dhiisuu hin qabu ture
And it’s still the same.	Ammas kanuma.
I can't quite believe she's mine	Isheen kan koo ta'uu ishee guutummaatti amanuu hin danda'u
I was one of the lucky few	Ani warra carraa qaban muraasa keessaa tokko ture
Perhaps you already have.	Tarii duraan qabdu taʼa.
I just said to quit a little	Xiqqoo dhiisuu qofa jedheen ture
That’s my father.	Sun abbaa kooti.
He had no sound.	Sagalee hin qabu ture.
No one else looked at me.	Namni biraa na ilaale hin jiru.
I didn't understand what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle.
He wanted to live life with her.	Jireenya ishee waliin jiraachuu barbaade.
Who would have thought.	Silaa eenyutu yaada ture.
He made himself think of nothing.	Homaa akka hin yaadne of godhe.
It’s doing their job, again.	Hojii isaanii hojjechaa jira, ammas.
I wondered what he could say	Maal jechuu danda'a jedheen yaade
I'm going to do it.	Ani itti deemaa jira.
But there can be.	Garuu jiraachuu danda'a.
I just thought you might know something	Waan tokko beektu ta'a jedheen yaade qofa
You can do it here.	Halkan gochuu dandeessa.
He is not old enough.	Umuriin isaa gahaa miti.
Serious, serious problems.	Rakkoo hamaa, hamaa.
He seemed to have no such luck.	Carraa akkasii hin qabu fakkaata ture.
I couldn’t believe he was still there	Ammas akka jiru amanuu hin dandeenye
I think this is a mistake	Kun dogoggora natti fakkaata
I want you as much as you want me	Anis akkuma ati na barbaaddu si barbaada
He had no evil	Hamaa hin qabu ture
He’s just different from me.	Inni ana irraa adda qofa.
It doesn't come of itself.	Ofii hin dhufu.
I know a lot about you	Waa'ee kee waan baay'een beeka
I know there has to be something	Waan tokko jiraachuu akka qabu nan beeka
I looked at his cart	Anis gaarii isaa ilaale
I was with my parents	Warra koo waliin ture
But there is hope.	Abdiin garuu jira.
I thought about going	Anis deemuuf yaade
I knew she was in there	Achi keessa akka jirtu nan beeka ture
So it has to work.	Kanaaf hojjechuu qaba.
He just wasn’t that into me.	Inni akkas na keessa hin turre qofa.
Everything went well so far.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deeme.
I know there are a lot of you	Isin baay'ee akka jirtu nan beeka
He looked at me again.	Ammas na ilaale.
He thought about an answer.	Deebii tokko irratti yaade.
Maybe it's nothing.	Tarii homaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
But maybe that’s not right.	Garuu tarii sun sirrii miti.
He wanted something else.	Waan biraa barbaade.
It’s not for you.	Siif miti.
I was right.	Sirrii jedheen ture.
I want to be alone for him	Isaaf kophaa ta'uu barbaada
Once there was a reason.	Yeroo tokko sababni jira ture.
I was the one who did that to you	Kan akkas si godhe ana ture
He did that for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf akkas godhe.
I didn’t intend to do that	Ani akkas gochuuf hin yaadne
But he couldn't do it.	Inni garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
Can't.	Hin danda'u.
He must know he is there.	Inni achi jiraachuu isaa beekuu qaba.
Again, the door.	Ammas balbala.
I don’t mean you, of course.	Si jechuu koo miti, beekamaadha.
I should have done it earlier	Silaa kana dura gochuun qaba ture
He can do that again	Ammas akkas gochuu danda'a
I knew what he meant.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade nan beeka ture.
He realized she didn’t want to say her name.	Maqaa ishee dubbachuu akka hin barbaanne hubate.
They can school their children.	Ijoollee isaanii mana barumsaa gochuu danda’u.
I thought that might be good	Sun gaarii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
I don’t, even for you.	Ani hin godhu, siif illee.
Maybe soon, but definitely not yet.	Tarii yeroo dhiyootti, garuu ammallee akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I wondered if you could find her	Ishee argachuu dandeessaa jedheen yaade
I don't think so.	Akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
They knew it wasn’t their job.	Hojii isaanii akka hin taane ni beeku turan.
It was three years ago.	Waggaa sadii dura ture.
It works very well so far.	Hanga ammaatti baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
I know what that feels like	Sun maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka
I should have done it all	Silaa hunda gochuun qaba ture
He went through everything	Waan hundumaa keessa darbe
They already think little of us.	Isaan duruu waan xiqqoo nutti yaadu.
They can do it.	Ni danda'u.
I couldn’t believe my eyes	Ija koo amanuu hin dandeenye
We were good enough.	Gaarii gahaa turre.
Yours seems to be something like that.	Kan kee garuu waan akkasii fakkaata.
We are in a new era.	Bara haaraa keessa jirra.
Very, very nice.	Baayyee baayyee namatti tola.
I can eat the food just fine	Nyaata sana akka gaariitti nyaachuu nan danda'a
He didn’t want to be left alone.	Kophaa isaa dhiisuu hin barbaanne.
I had none of those things	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin qabu ture
A lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
We have two opinions.	Yaada lama qabna.
I have, you have, we all have	Ani qaba, qabda, hundi keenya qabna
I just didn't know that was the case	Akkas akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
She was a human being.	Isheen nama turte.
He looked at it again.	Ammas ilaale.
Of course, this never happens.	Kun gonkumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I know what you have to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabdu nan beeka.
In our household.	Mana keenya keessatti.
I really wish that was the case.	Dhuguma osoo akkas ta'ee natti tola.
That thing wouldn’t have caught up with her.	Silaa wanti sun ishee hin qabu ture.
Things she shouldn’t know.	Wantoota isheen beekuu hin qabne.
But no one wants to be that girl.	Garuu namni intala sana ta'uu barbaadu hin jiru.
That seems inevitable.	Sun waan hin oolle fakkaata.
He wants to live a life	Jireenya jiraachuu barbaada
That was obvious to us.	Sun nuuf ifa ture.
I haven't thought about it yet	Hanga ammaatti hin yaadne
It doesn't matter what it is.	Maal akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
He said it again.	Ammas jedhe.
But we had very little.	Garuu baayyee xiqqoo qabna turre.
I want to be where you are	Bakka ati jirtu nan barbaada
It's just like that.	Akkas qofa.
It worked, until it went.	Hojjete, hanga deeme.
They are nothing like this.	Isaan homaa akka kanaa miti.
I didn’t know what to do with them	Maal akkan isaan godhu hin beeku ture
They have to be in the same place.	Bakka tokko ta'uu qabu.
Someone else and she would.	Namni biraa fi isheen silaa.
She was something.	Isheen waan tokko turte.
I just have one thing for him	Waan tokko qofa isaaf qaba
But he’s not really a bad guy.	Garuu dhuguma nama hamaa miti.
They are not real.	Isaan dhugaa miti.
They don't have much around them.	Waan baay'ee naannoo isaanii hin qaban.
Luckily it wasn't necessary.	Akka carraa ta'ee barbaachisaa hin turre.
Now you are in a new situation.	Amma haala haaraa keessa jirta.
He's a good one.	Inni gaarii dha.
I never knew my real father	Abbaa koo isa dhugaa gonkumaa hin beeku ture
But there were few such people.	Garuu namoonni akkasii muraasa turan.
I know she exists.	Akka isheen jirtu nan beeka.
We only have you our important question.	Si qofa qabna gaaffii keenya barbaachisaa.
She was only there for a couple of hours.	Sa'aatii lama lama qofa achi turte.
But it was like that.	Garuu akkas ture.
They were hopeful.	Abdii qaban turan.
Look where he is now.	Amma eessa akka jiru ilaalaa.
He is not good for you.	Inni siif gaarii miti.
I can't see him like that	Akkasitti isa arguu hin danda'u
At that moment I saw why there was nothing here	Yeroo sanatti maaliif asitti homaa akka hin jirre arge
I should have said that.	Silaa akkas jechuun qaba ture.
It doesn't matter though.	Dhimma hin qabu garuu.
I couldn't believe this was happening	Kun ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
I feel really good about it	Waa'ee kanaa dhuguma miira gaarii qaba
I have no idea.	Ani yaada hin qabu.
But this doesn’t work.	Garuu kun hin hojjetu.
He was there for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf achi ture.
Someone had to do it	Namni tokko gochuu qaba ture
I go everywhere.	Bakka hunda nan deema.
I knew that was coming	Sun akka dhufu nan beeka ture
I can't say that's a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii dha jechuu hin danda'u.
I didn’t talk to him	Isa waliin hin dubbanne
No one had any idea what he had just said.	Waan amma jedhe namni yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I know you know what happened	Waan ta'e akka beektu nan beeka
This was terrible.	Kun hamaa ture.
So it works.	Kanaaf ni hojjeta.
He wouldn't be who he is now.	Silaa amma eenyu akka ta'e hin ta'u ture.
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
He knew perfectly well.	Inni guutummaatti sirriitti beeka ture.
Look at her dress.	Uffata ishee ilaalaa.
He knew things no man could know.	Wantoota namni beekuu hin dandeenye beeka ture.
I still have that.	Ammallee sana qaba.
A clear day.	Guyyaa ifa ta'e.
I love that!.	Sana nan jaalladha!.
It doesn’t mean that.	Jechuun jechuu miti.
There is no question.	Gaaffii hin qabu.
She's the only one.	Isheen qofa.
I don’t exactly like it.	Ani sirriitti hin jaalladhu.
He doesn’t need that.	Sana isa hin barbaachisu.
I love your daughter	Intala kee nan jaalladha
You had to have someone though.	Nama qabaachuu qabda turte garuu.
Not such a good idea.	Yaada gaarii akkasii miti.
Not hours ago.	Sa'aatii dura miti.
It may no longer be.	Kana booda taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
He did bad things to a lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee irratti waan hamaa hojjete.
That someone treated you very badly.	Namni tokko baayyee hamaa akka si ilaale.
I couldn’t get an answer	Deebii argachuu hin dandeenye
It has a lot in it.	Waan baay'ee of keessaa qaba.
I have no problem with that at all.	Sana irratti tasumaa rakkoo hin qabu.
It wasn’t their business.	Dhimma isaanii hin turre.
He just wanted a feeling.	Miira qofa barbaade.
That was pretty easy.	Sun baayʼee salphaa ture.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
What happens after that.	Isa booda maaltu ta'a.
I mean, sure he can do well	Ani jechuun koo, mirkanaa'aa inni gaarii hojjechuu danda'a
It is, but that’s not important.	Ni jira, garuu sun barbaachisaa miti.
But, of course, no one thought about that.	Garuu, beekamaadha, namni waa’ee sanaa yaade hin jiru.
It was too early, too soon.	Dafee ture, dafee ture.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
She has to go.	Isheen deemuu qabdi.
Then, I wanted to go home.	Sana booda, gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaade.
I wonder how they are doing that	Akkamitti akkas gochaa jiru jedheen yaada
They look like a great place	Bakka guddaa fakkaatu
It's a complete duty.	Dirqama guutuu ta'e.
I think she has her reasons	Sababa ishee qabdi jedheen yaada
I might ask you the same question.	Gaaffii wal fakkaatu si gaafachuu danda'a.
I want to know him	Isa beekuu barbaada
Couldn't ask for much more, I think.	Kana caalaa baay'ee gaafachuu hin dandeenye, natti fakkaata.
I knew what forgiveness meant	Dhiifama jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e nan beeka ture
He will be waiting for you.	Inni si eegaa jiraata.
That's not really a lot of people.	Sun dhuguma namoota baay'ee miti.
That's going to be huge.	Sun guddaa ta'uuf deema.
Walking in the light.	Ifa keessa deemuu.
That is probably why.	Kanaaf taʼuu hin oolu.
So I was very happy.	Kanaaf baay'een gammade.
Not one.	Tokko miti.
I didn’t know what to say	Maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
Something outside the room.	Waan kutaa ala jiru.
It wasn't about why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin turre.
I know it couldn't have been easy.	Silaa salphaa ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka.
I know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka.
We have time.	Yeroo qabna.
There is none of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
This is the same thing.	Kun kanuma.
I can never go back	Yoomiyyuu deebi'uu hin danda'u
It seems right.	Sirrii fakkaata.
I couldn’t leave them here	Asitti isaan dhiisuu hin dandeenye
You will never leave again.	Kana booda gonkumaa hin deemtu.
But he didn't think about it.	Garuu hin yaadne.
I really enjoyed this episode	Kutaa kana baay'een itti gammadeera
She didn’t like him then.	Yeroo sanatti isa hin jaallattu turte.
I thought you were here	Ati as jirta jedheen yaade
I didn’t see why they wouldn’t just do that	Maaliif akkas qofa akka hin goone hin argine
He knows a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee beeka.
It's much more important than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee barbaachisaa dha.
They are very wrong.	Isaan baay'ee dogoggora.
Just like the duty.	Akkuma dirqama.
I suspect it wasn’t a bad life	Jireenya hamaa akka hin turre nan shakka
I knew what was in it.	Waan keessa jiru nan beeka ture.
People want that.	Namoonni akkas barbaadu.
There had to be something, something really dangerous.	Waan tokko, wanti dhuguma balaa qabu tokko jiraachuu qaba ture.
He’s not the only one like him.	Inni qofa miti kan akka isaa.
But we went on.	Garuu itti deemne.
I didn’t want to see her	Ishee arguu hin barbaanne
He wanted to know him	Isa beekuu barbaade
It may not have been necessary.	Barbaachisaa hin turre ta'a.
I am one of the lucky ones	Ani warra carraa qaban keessaa tokko
But I couldn’t do any of that.	Garuu sana keessaa tokkollee gochuu hin dandeenye.
We have no idea what it looks like.	Maal akka fakkaatu yaada hin qabnu.
On a first, no problem.	Dura tokko irratti, rakkoo hin qabu.
Those would come later.	Isaan sun booda dhufu turan.
Not his father though.	Abbaa isaa miti garuu.
I had to do this.	Kana gochuun qaba ture.
Maybe he wants to do it	Tarii gochuu barbaada ta'a
I know why you did what you did today	Waan har'a goote maaliif akka goote nan beeka
It all seems too much to me.	Hundi isaa natti baay'ee natti fakkaata.
It was doing very well	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa ture
They can exist.	Jiraachuu danda'u.
It was a tall man thing.	Waan nama dheeraa ture.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
I really want to do that	Sana gochuuf baay'een barbaada
You will never do that.	Yoomiyyuu akkas hin gootu.
I knew it was too easy	Garmalee salphaa akka ture nan beeka ture
I just can't get this right	Kana qofa sirriitti argachuu hin danda'u
So completely unlike her.	Kanaaf guutummaatti ishee irraa adda.
She needed food.	Nyaata ishee barbaachisa ture.
I didn’t go all the way	Karaa hundumaa hin deemne
They had a good life.	Jireenya gaarii qaban turan.
That was a terrible situation.	Sun haala hamaa ture.
No one loves her.	Namni ishee jaallatu hin jiru.
I wasn’t good enough.	Ani gaarii hin turre.
Today was supposed to be a good day.	Har'a guyyaa gaarii ta'uu qaba ture.
I know your thoughts on this guy	Yaada keessan gurbaa kana irratti nan beeka
Maybe you're right.	Tarii sirrii jette ta'a.
But I would never do that.	Ani garuu gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
This is not the time for that.	Yeroon kun yeroo sanaa miti.
We were waiting.	Eegaa turre.
Everyone who was here knew about it.	Namni as ture hundi waa'ee kanaa ni beeka ture.
They are both.	Isaan lamaan.
It was easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa ture.
Where he used to go	Bakka inni duraan deemaa ture
People who are nothing like you.	Namoota akka kee homaa hin taane.
Hope this can be her home	Kun mana ishee ta'uu akka danda'u abdii
I should never have gone back	Silaa gonkumaa duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu ture
Until recently that is.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti sun jechuun.
That's very dangerous.	Sun baayyee balaa qaba.
I hadn't even noticed he was out	Akka inni ba'e illee hin hubanne ture
You will have to go to my place.	Bakka koo deemuun dirqama ta'a.
I mean what it used to mean	Duraan maal jechuu akka ta'e jechuu kooti
She has everything.	Waan hundumaa qabdi.
Someone like them.	Nama akka isaanii.
I love the sound of it	Sagalee isaa baay'een jaalladha
I know her very well	Ani akka gaariitti ishee beeka
I didn’t mean anything negative	Waan hamaa jechuu koo hin turre
No one wanted to talk about it.	Namni waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu barbaade hin turre.
She didn’t realize she wasn’t good enough	Isheen akka gaarii hin taane hin hubanne
Doesn't seem like much, does it.	Baay'ee hin fakkaatu mitii.
I didn’t even see that.	Sana illee hin argine.
I mean, it wasn’t that long.	Hamma kana hin turre jechuu kooti.
I saw all those things	Wantoota sana hunda nan arge
It’s never been anything dangerous.	Gonkumaa waan balaa qabu hin taane.
I knew he wasn’t my father	Abbaa koo akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I wondered about the possibilities	Waa'ee waan ta'uu danda'u nan yaade
You and she.	Ati fi isheen.
Teacher, thoughtful.	Barsiisaa, nama yaadu.
I hadn’t seen it before	Kanaan dura hin argine ture
They know the truth.	Dhugaa jiru ni beeku.
You have enough time.	Yeroo gahaa qabda.
I thought that was a pretty good way	Sun karaa baay'ee gaarii ta'e natti fakkaate
I don't have anything.	Ani homaa hin qabu.
But they’re not the only ones.	Garuu isaan qofa miti.
I love that question.	Gaaffii sana baay'een jaalladha.
We have to go.	Deemuu qabna.
We don’t do it.	Nuti hin goonu.
We'll be with him tomorrow.	Boru isa waliin jirra.
Then join us.	Sana booda nu waliin ta'aa.
I just like it a lot more now.	Amma baay'ee natti tola qofa.
I think I came at a bad time	Yeroo hamaa waanan dhufe natti fakkaata
Look at this issue.	Dhimma kana ilaalaa.
I know he is watching us	Akka nu ilaalaa jiru nan beeka
Of course, he had to admit that he wasn’t.	Akka hin taane amanuu akka qabu beekamaadha.
That’s a mistake.	Sun dogoggora.
I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
But it’s not good.	Garuu gaarii miti.
I think he would have loved it all	Silaa hunda isaa ni jaallata jedheen yaada
This is a possibility.	Kun ta’uu danda’a.
Of course you have.	Akka qabdu beekamaadha.
It can work in a day.	Guyyaa tokko keessatti hojjechuu danda'a.
Now it has another name.	Amma maqaa biraa qaba.
But at the time, he had many problems.	Yeroo sanatti garuu rakkoo hedduu qaba ture.
I never said anything	Ani homaa jedhee hin beeku
It was quick.	Dafee ture.
Two for me, two.	Naaf lama lama.
That was another reason for doing it this way.	Akkasitti gochuuf sababni biraa kanuma ture.
Now, things were different.	Amma, wanti jiru adda ture.
He still had no answer	Ammallee deebii hin qabu ture
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
We don’t have this feeling.	Miira kana hin qabnu.
I knew it would be with you	Si waliin akka ta'u nan beeka ture
We have a house there.	Achitti mana qabna.
Now he knew what that was.	Amma wanti sun maal akka taʼe beeka ture.
I want that as much as you do	Anis akkuma kee sana barbaada
Which, of course, she is.	Kan, beekamaadha, isheen taate.
I didn’t really know my parents	Dhuguma warra koo hin beeku ture
I don't want money.	Ani qarshii hin barbaadu.
It will do you a lot of good.	Gaarii baay'ee siif godha.
I gave him a lot.	Waan baay'een isaaf kenne.
That won't be necessary.	Sun barbaachisaa hin ta'u.
I am not a wife to him	Ani isaaf haadha manaa miti
I just have it.	Ani qofa qaba.
I can't tell anymore.	Kana booda himuu hin danda'u.
He is drinking too much.	Garmalee dhugaa jira.
It was more than I thought.	Ani waan yaade caalaa ture.
I didn't know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
You have to stay here.	Asitti turuu qabda.
I have no idea, really	Ani yaada hin qabu, dhuguma
I know what you are going to say	Waan ati jechuu deemtu nan beeka
I’m glad I did it.	Hojjechuu kootti gammadeera.
He wasn't doing too badly	Baay'ee hamaa hojjechaa hin turre
A very important person	Nama baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e
I might say some things.	Waan tokko tokko jechuu danda'a.
I know you will do your best.	Waan dandeessu hunda akka gootu nan beeka.
Nobody did that in my time.	Yeroo kootti namni akkas godhe hin jiru.
I just love them so much	Ani baay'een isaan jaalladha qofa
It’s like having him in my mouth.	Afaan koo keessa isa qabaachuu fakkaata.
This is not entirely accurate.	Kun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
He could have found something.	Silaa waan tokko argachuu danda'a ture.
It won't be a house.	Mana hin ta'u.
The truth is that’s not all.	Dhugaa jiru garuu kana qofa miti.
I know it can only ever be about tonight	Yoomiyyuu waa'ee halkan kanaa qofa ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka
I looked just like him	Anis akkuma isaa fakkaata ture
It can't happen here.	Asitti ta'uu hin danda'u.
Proper.	Kan ta'u.
He said he loved us.	Nu jaalladha jedhe.
Now it’s just the two of them.	Amma lamaan qofa.
I really wanted to cry	Iyyuu baay'een barbaade
I thought you wanted me	Na barbaaddu natti fakkaate
It was never enough.	Gonkumaa gahaa hin turre.
I need everyone there	Nama achi jiru hunda na barbaachisa
I just didn't quite know how	Akkamitti akka ta'u qofa sirriitti hin beeku ture
I didn’t want anything more.	Kana caalaa waanan qabu hin barbaanne.
He’s onto some good stuff.	Inni waan gaarii tokko tokko irra jira.
I know you wouldn’t have.	Silaa akka hin qabne nan beeka.
I still couldn't believe it was him	Ammallee isa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
It’s not about making money.	Maallaqa argachuu miti.
There is	Ni jira .
I haven't thought about it yet	Hanga ammaatti hin yaadne
Sorry, there’s nothing we can do about it.	Dhiifama, wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
About.	Waa'ee.
I think it's very accurate	Baayyee sirrii natti fakkaata
I was trying to do something nice for you	Waan gaarii siif hojjechuuf yaalaa ture
He talked about a lot of things.	Waa'ee waan baay'ee dubbate.
I don't know how yet.	Akkamitti hanga ammaatti hin beeku.
Not all of it is right.	Hundi sirrii miti.
They are looking for help.	Gargaarsa barbaadaa jiru.
I think this is all some big mistake	Kun hundi dogoggora guddaa tokko tokko natti fakkaata
I recognize that voice.	Sagalee sana nan beeka.
I always make it special	Yeroo hunda adda akka ta'u nan godha
He must know that is not true	Sun dhugaa akka hin taane beekuu qaba
We have a lot of the same interests.	Fedhii wal fakkaatu baay'ee qabna.
You are mine.	Ati kan kooti.
Simple conditions, really.	Haala salphaa, dhuguma.
But here, there is none.	Garuu asitti, tokkollee hin jiru.
This month we are doing something a little different.	Ji'a kana waan xiqqoo adda ta'e hojjechaa jirra.
I need this more than anything	Kana waan hunda caalaa na barbaachisa
You know everyone.	Nama hunda beekta.
I want another room	Kutaa biraa nan barbaada
I can't be your wife	Ani haadha manaa kee ta'uu hin danda'u
So that was her problem.	Kanaaf rakkoon ishee kanuma ture.
I had it.	Ani qaba ture.
That was something we were looking into.	Sun waan nuti keessa ilaalaa turre ture.
It was never enough.	Gonkumaa gahaa hin turre.
But even that didn’t last long.	Garuu sun illee yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I don't know how much.	Meeqa akka ta'e hin beeku.
That’s why I love you.	Kanaaf si jaalladha.
We don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu.
I began to wonder	Anis of gaafachuu jalqabe
I almost couldn't find you	Si argachuu hin dandeenye jechuun ni danda'ama
Obviously not then.	Yeroo sana akka hin taane ifaadha.
I haven't seen it yet, it can't be anything	Hanga ammaatti hin argine, homaa ta'uu hin danda'u
I even said it was very obvious	Baayyee ifaadha jedheen illee ture
We have to think about his name.	Maqaa isaaf yaadu qabna.
Look for new people.	Namoota haaraa barbaadaa.
More than that, please.	Sana caalaa mee.
We are not those people.	Nuti namoota sana miti.
That is not the case now.	Amma akkas miti.
It was their life.	Jireenya isaanii ture.
He had no interest though	Fedhii tokkollee hin qabu ture garuu
I wonder if he’s involved	Inni harka keessa jiraa jedheen yaada
It was late in the afternoon.	Yeroon isaa waaree booda ture.
So they have to ask the parents for money.	Kanaaf warra qarshii gaafachuu qabu.
I wanted her with me	Ishee na waliin barbaade
That is probably the biggest one.	Sun tarii isa guddaa taʼuu hin oolu.
I really can't see that happening.	Dhuguma akkas ta'uu isaa arguu hin danda'u.
Maybe it's an annual.	Tarii waggaa waggaa ta'uu danda'a.
Forgiveness for it.	Dhiifama isaaf.
I haven’t known them for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan hin beeku
Nobody was in anything.	Namni homaa keessa hin turre.
He tried his father's door.	Balbala abbaa isaa yaale.
He knew exactly who she was	Eenyu akka taate sirriitti beeka ture
He has his own.	Kan isaa qaba.
I didn't know what to think about it	Waa'ee kanaa maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
I wanted to tell him the truth	Dhugaa jiru itti himuu barbaade
But that is clearly not the case.	Garuu akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
I saw her in school, here	Mana barumsaa keessatti ishee arge, asitti
You have to find her.	Ishee argachuu qabda.
I thought you didn’t care	Ati dhimma hin qabdu jedheen yaade
That's going to happen.	Sun ta'uuf jira.
But it’s not just the environment.	Garuu naannoo qofa miti.
What you want to do for you is there.	Wanti ati siif gochuu barbaaddu achi jira.
I just can't do you right now	Yeroo ammaa kana qofa si gochuu hin danda'u
This should be the case.	Kun ta’uu qaba.
They stayed with me for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa na waliin turan.
We are always on our way to it.	Yeroo hundumaa gara isaatti karaa irra jirra.
That seems like a big deal.	Sun waan guddaa ta’e fakkaata.
I thought this would be a good time.	Yeroon kun yeroo gaarii ta'a jedheen yaade.
What exists, exists.	Wanti jiru, jira.
I have no other way.	Karaa biraa hin qabu.
I could never do anything like that	Waan akkasii hojjechuu gonkumaa hin dandeenye
I didn't tell him about that though	Waa'ee sanaa garuu itti hin himne
It could have been anything it needed to be.	Waan ta’uu qabu hunda ta’uu danda’a ture.
I want you to love me this much	Hamma kana akka na jaallattu nan barbaada
That said, you still have to ask the bartender.	Kana jechuun ammallee nama mana dhugaatii hojjetu gaafachuu qabda.
We have almost nothing.	Homaa hin qabnu jechuun ni danda'ama.
He is with us.	Inni nu waliin jira.
It was late in the afternoon.	Yeroon isaa waaree booda ture.
I hadn’t seen them in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan hin argine ture.
I could get it for you	Siif argachuu nan danda'a ture
He knows nothing about me	Waa'ee koo homaa hin beeku
I like this drink.	Dhugaatii kana natti tola.
I think this is what we need to do.	Kun waan gochuu qabnu natti fakkaata.
Everyone could say that.	Namni hundi akkas jechuu danda'a ture.
Great great great.	Guddaa guddaa guddaa.
I was so excited about this little guy	Waa'ee gurbaa xiqqoo kanaa baay'een gammade
Maybe he really means it.	Tarii dhuguma jechuu ta'uu danda'a.
You don't have anything right.	Waan sirrii hin qabdu.
You are absolutely there.	Ati guutummaatti jirta.
This one seemed to enjoy it.	Inni kun waan itti gammade fakkaata ture.
But it had to come from somewhere.	Garuu bakka tokko irraa dhufuu qaba ture.
I love that food.	Nyaata sana baay'een jaalladha.
He would not have existed.	Silaa inni hin jiru ture.
He is my father.	Inni abbaa kooti.
I didn’t think about it any more until recently	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti kana caalaa itti hin yaadne
I can't tell you what's going to happen	Waan ta'uuf jiru sitti himuu hin danda'u
Like a little girl.	Akka intala xiqqoo.
But it’s not that simple.	Garuu akkas salphaa miti.
So it was easy.	Kanaaf salphaa ture.
I don't know exactly.	Sirriitti hin beeku.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
It was something that would happen.	Waan ta’u ture.
That wasn’t easy.	Sun salphaa hin turre.
Not the chance of that.	Carraa sanaa miti.
He's not there.	Achi hin jiru.
I didn't have much to say about it	Waa'ee kanaa waanan jedhu baay'ee hin qabu ture
As we do, of course.	Akkuma goonu beekamaadha.
That's how she did it.	Akkasitti goote.
It was a lot of money at the time.	Yeroo sanatti maallaqa guddaa ture.
I'm pretty sure it did.	Akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa dha.
I am a very, very good guy.	Ani gurbaa baayyee baayyee gaarii dha.
I couldn’t walk everything	Waan hundumaa deemuu hin dandeenye
I have nothing to say to any of you.	Isin keessaa tokkollee waanan jedhu hin qabu.
What's going on?.	Maaltu ta'aa jira?.
Otherwise good idea.	Yoo kana hin taane yaada gaarii.
I don’t know if he got them.	Isaan argachuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
It doesn’t have a good one.	Gaarii hin qabu.
This could be my chance.	Kun carraa koo ta'uu danda'a.
I am sure about that	Waa'ee kanaa mirkanaa'aa dha
Everyone around knows what happened there.	Waan achitti ta'e namni naannoo sana jiru hundi ni beeka.
The problem is, it’s not true.	Rakkoon jiru, dhugaa miti.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
Do you think you have what it takes?.	Waan barbaachisu waan qabdu sitti fakkaataa?.
That we both do.	Akka lamaan keenya iyyuu akka goonu.
It was a little bit earlier.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo duraan ture.
This is not a new idea.	Kun yaada haaraa miti.
He wanted everything.	Waan hundumaa barbaada ture.
I was once one of those people	Ani yeroo tokko namoota sana keessaa tokko ture
It’s good so far.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii dha.
I want to play with my kids	Ijoollee koo waliin taphachuu barbaada
He used to have feelings	Duraan miira qaba ture
If we understand each other	Yoo wal hubanne .
I can't believe she's gone	Isheen akka hin jirre amanuu hin danda'u
Everything went really well	Dhuguma wanti hundi sirriitti deeme
There was a little bit of me there	Xiqqoo na keessaa achi ture
I didn’t want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaanne.
Year in and year out.	Waggaa keessaa fi waggaa keessaa.
I saw these really big eyes	Ija dhuguma guddaa kana arge
But it was none of these things.	Garuu wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
My wife's husband.	Haadha manaa koo.
I didn’t even know who bought the place	Bakka sana namni bite illee hin beeku ture
She needs to say something.	Waan tokko dubbachuu qabdi.
But this was her territory.	Garuu kun naannoo ishee ture.
You just do it.	Ati qofa gootu.
But it was possible.	Garuu ni danda'ama ture.
I know it’s okay to say	Jechuun homaa akka hin taane nan beeka
I'm sure of that.	Sana mirkanaa'aa dha.
They certainly were.	Akka turan beekamaadha.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Ani amanuu qofa hin barbaanne
She couldn’t quite say that.	Isheen guutummaatti akkas jechuu hin dandeenye.
A very, very young girl	Intala baayyee baayyee xiqqoo
I can do this, no problem	Kana gochuu nan danda'a, rakkoo hin qabu
I have it now.	Amma qaba.
While it is in our house	Osoo ta'u mana keenya keessa jira
I only have this one	Ani isa kana qofa qaba
I know you don’t.	Akka ati hin goone nan beeka.
I might know a few names	Maqaa muraasa beekuu danda'a
It hasn’t been there yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin turre.
A little bit of both	Xiqqoo lamaan isaanii
I think about it often.	Yeroo baay'ee nan yaada.
This works well for me.	Kun akka gaariitti naaf hojjeta.
Then it will be easier.	Sana booda salphaa ta'a.
They had no children together	Ijoollee waliin hin qaban turan
I have to think that’s very likely.	Sun carraa guddaa qaba jedheen yaadu qaba.
I was waiting for that question	Gaaffii sana eegaa ture
I knew it was me, always me	Ana akka ta'e nan beeka ture, yeroo hundumaa ana
That's the obvious thing you can tell.	Wanti ifa ta'e ati himuu dandeessu kanuma.
I looked at him inside.	Anis keessa isa ilaale.
No one would ever know.	Namni tokkollee gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
I know you're thinking about that	Waa'ee sanaa akka yaaddu nan beeka
They can see him.	Isa arguu danda'u.
She was nothing.	Isheen homaa hin turre.
He thought she was someone else.	Nama biraa akka taate yaade.
I have a good feeling about it	Ani waa'ee isaa miira gaarii qaba
Always was, always will be.	Yeroo hundumaa ture, yeroo hundumaa ni ta'a.
What? 	Maal?
said.	jedhe.
For a moment it seemed like too much work.	Yeroo muraasaaf hojii garmalee guddaa fakkaata ture.
But it shouldn't have been him.	Garuu isa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
Not so in this case.	Haala kana keessatti akkas miti.
Everything is right	Wanti hundi sirrii dha
No one could see a thing.	Namni tokkollee waan tokko arguu hin dandeenye.
That’s really nice.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola.
That’s not life.	Sun jireenya miti.
I am nothing but nothing else.	Ani waan tokko malee waan biraa miti.
There is nothing else you can do.	Wanti biraa ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
We haven’t seen it in our lives.	Jireenya keenya keessatti hin argine.
I was hers, she was mine	Ani kan ishee ture, isheen kan koo turte
I couldn’t believe he was even thinking about that	Sana illee yaada keessa akka jiru amanuu hin dandeenye
When it's easier.	Yeroo salphaa ta'e.
I have no idea what’s in it.	Waan keessa jiru yaada hin qabu.
I need help please.	Gargaarsa na barbaachisa maaloo.
I didn’t do anything for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf homaa hin hojjenne
It was more exact than that.	Sana caalaa sirriitti ture.
I looked around.	Anis naannoo koo ilaale.
It’s not going to last.	Waan turuuf hin deemu.
You should know, you were there.	Beekuu qabda, ati achi turte.
So he went away for a while	Kanaaf yeroo muraasaaf ni deeme
There's not much you can say about that.	Waa'ee sanaa waan baay'ee jechuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I have nowhere else to go.	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin qabu.
I still can't see her as my own	Ammallee akka kan kootti ishee arguu hin danda'u
That was a special time in my life.	Yeroon sun jireenya koo keessatti yeroo adda taʼe ture.
It had to be a place.	Bakka ta'uu qaba ture.
So it's pretty good.	Kanaaf baayyee gaarii dha.
I want something similar, but way easier	Ani waan wal fakkaatu nan barbaada, garuu karaa salphaa ta'e
I often wonder what he is up to now.	Yeroo baayyee amma maal irra jira jedheen yaada.
This is usually not a good idea.	Yeroo baay’ee kun yaada gaarii miti.
That's where it belongs.	Bakka itti ta'u kanuma.
I just went through them, of course.	Isaan qofa keessa darbe, beekamaadha.
I have many of you	Baay'ee keessan qaba
I know you have something	Waan tokko akka qabdu nan beeka
I'm new to this, but this	Ani kanaaf haaraa dha, garuu kana
He might find someone else.	Nama biraa argachuu danda'a.
Not just the greatest, but the best.	Guddaa qofa osoo hin taane, isa gaarii.
I didn’t want him to go	Akka inni deemu hin barbaanne
I think a lot of people do	Namoonni baay'een ni godhu jedheen yaada
This all works well.	Kun hundi akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I know it wasn’t easy for you	Siif salphaa akka hin turre nan beeka
Expect something good.	Waan gaarii eegaa.
I like it very much.	Baay'ee natti tola.
I can't tell you anymore	Kana booda sitti himuu hin danda'u
It could have been a disaster.	Silaa balaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
He has to help himself.	Of gargaaruu qaba.
Again, it's not just about one person.	Ammas waa'ee nama tokko qofa miti.
It could have been later.	Silaa booda ta'uu danda'a ture.
I know it wasn’t	Akka hin turre nan beeka
I like it that simple.	Akkas salphaa ta'ee natti tola.
The problem is important.	Rakkoon jiru barbaachisaa dha.
Really, there would only be one person.	Dhuguma, silaa namni tokko qofa jiraata.
If you don't.	Yoo hin goone.
This one, however, is different.	Inni kun garuu adda.
They were no different.	Isaan adda hin turre.
I won't do anything for you	Ani homaa siif hin godhu
I never wanted to live in that place	Bakka sana jiraachuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
He didn’t want people to know	Namoonni akka hin beekne hin barbaanne
He went above and beyond.	Kanaa ol deeme.
Couldn't be so lucky	Akkas carraa qabaachuu hin dandeenye
Anyone have any suggestions?.	Namni yaada qabu jiraa?.
I mean, look at you now	Amma si ilaalaa jechuu kooti
I wonder what that was	Sun maal ture jedheen yaada
More than anything else.	Waan hundumaa caalaa.
We had them.	Isaan qabna turre.
We cannot live in the past.	Kan darbe keessa jiraachuu hin dandeenyu.
But nobody really knew much about him.	Garuu dhuguma namni waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee beeku hin turre.
But it could still be even bigger.	Garuu ammas kana caalaa guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
Just like she did.	Akkuma isheen goote.
A very long time ago indeed	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa dura dhuguma
I think it’s really cool	Dhuguma namatti tola jedheen yaada
These are not related.	Isaan kun wal hin qaban.
I didn't have much time	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabu ture
Sometimes it’s better to do nothing.	Yeroo tokko tokko homaa gochuu dhiisuu wayya.
I was just looking for you	Si qofa barbaadaa ture
People like her .	Namoonni akka ishee .
Who knows what is happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru eenyutu beeka.
You wouldn’t know me.	Silaa na hin beektu ture.
He didn’t have anything like that	Waan akkasii hin qabu ture
It’s always wrong.	Yeroo hundumaa dogoggora.
I didn't mean for this to happen	Kun akka ta'uuf hin yaadne
It’s not just me	Ana qofa miti
I didn’t have any of it.	Ani tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I was looking for help, I was looking for answers	Gargaarsa barbaadaa ture, deebii barbaadaa ture
Today, however, that is not the case.	Har'a garuu akkas miti.
I knew what was going on inside	Waan keessa ta'e nan beeka ture
But only for a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
He didn't want to find her	Hanga ishee argachuu hin barbaanne
I was so mean to you	Ani akka malee sitti hamaa ture
Someone I couldn't see about.	Nama waa'ee isaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I couldn't do anything	Waan tokko gochuu hin dandeenye
I could never see you like that	Ani gonkumaa akkasitti si arguu hin dandeenye
I think you should do it.	Ati gochuu qabdu jedheen yaada.
. . . .	.
It 's a good thing	Waan gaarii dha .
I can't believe you have the time	Yeroo qabdu jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
If so, where.	Yoo akkas ta'e eessa.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
That could be him.	Sun isa ta’uu danda’a.
But obviously not.	Garuu akka hin taane ifaadha.
I would never have done anything	Silaa gonkumaa homaa hin godhu ture
So everything else should be right.	Kanaaf wanti biraa hundi sirrii ta'uu qaba.
I think he realized it was me	Ana ta'uu isaa waan hubate natti fakkaata
My father.	Abbaa koo.
It wouldn't happen any other time.	Yeroo biraa hin ta'u ture.
I told myself I could do this.	Kana gochuu nan danda'a jedhee ofitti hime.
I need you to do it.	Akka ati gootu na barbaachisa.
I mean, something happened today	Har'a wanti tokko ta'e jechuu kooti
I don’t need any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee hin barbaadu.
I am always there.	Yeroo hundumaa nan jira.
She wasn’t giving anything away.	Isheen homaa kennuu hin turre.
I wouldn't have understood	Silaa naaf hin galle
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
That was a really long time ago.	Sun dhuguma yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
I had no idea what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru homaa hin beeku ture
You guys should know.	Isin beekuu qabdu.
I’m hoping, very much, that everything goes well	Ani abdiin qaba, baay’ee, wanti hundi akka gaariitti akka deemu
Maybe even in the morning.	Tarii ganama illee ta'a.
They’re just trying to get a job done.	Hojii tokko hojjechuuf qofa yaalaa jiru.
I didn't think they existed anymore	Kana booda jiru jedhee hin yaadne ture
He had no idea what he wanted, why he was hesitant	Maal akka barbaadu, maaliif akka duubatti jedhu yaada hin qabu ture
Someone who needs help.	Nama gargaarsa barbaadu.
But they are not the real thing.	Garuu isaan waan dhugaa miti.
We need to respond.	Deebii kennuu qabna.
I know you care a lot	Baayyee akka siif yaadu nan beeka
I?m more clear on that today.	Ani har?a sana irratti caalaatti ifaadha.
With .	Waliin .
I didn't think I could do this	Kana gochuu danda'a jedhee hin yaadne
This is not the case.	Kun akkas miti.
Not great, not bad.	Guddaa miti, hamaa miti.
I didn’t know a thing	Waan tokko hin beeku ture
To do this.	Kana gochuuf.
He knew this voice.	Sagalee kana ni beeka ture.
I don't know what it is, exactly.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku, sirriitti.
Right.	Sirrii.
It says on the door.	Balbala irratti akkas jedha.
I looked up into her eyes	Ol jedheen ija ishee keessa ilaale
Like buying food.	Akka nyaata bitachuu.
I didn't do it with a lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee waliin hin goone.
It always works.	Yeroo hunda ni hojjeta.
I don't know what you are.	Maal akka taate hin beeku.
Outside of this space.	Bakka kanaan ala.
I can't be.	Ani ta'uu hin danda'u.
Only in this one case really.	Haala tokko kana qofa keessatti dhuguma.
He was such a good man.	Nama gaarii akkasii ture.
I hadn’t realized it was still there	Ammallee akka jiru hin hubanne ture
He has everything.	Waan hunda qaba.
So this had to be his life.	Kanaaf kun jireenya isaa ta’uu qaba ture.
I want to make one thing perfectly clear	Waan tokko guutummaatti ifa gochuu barbaada
They want a place.	Bakka barbaadu.
He has a desire.	Fedhii qaba.
Not feeling so good.	Miira akkas gaarii hin taane.
I don't think this is right.	Kun sirrii natti hin fakkaatu.
They weren’t that bad.	Isaan akkas hamaa hin turre.
He didn't speak like that	Akkasitti hin dubbanne
I can never tell you how much.	Meeqa akka ta'e gonkumaa sitti himuu hin danda'u.
This was supposed to happen.	Kun ta’uu qaba ture.
I don’t want him to know we saw him.	Isa argine akka beeku hin barbaadu.
She wasn’t alone.	Isheen kophaa ishee hin turre.
I still can't tell him the truth	Hanga ammaatti dhugaa itti himuu hin danda'u
The two of them go together.	Lamaan isaanii waliin deemu.
He said you have to go.	Deemu qabda jedhe.
I am here for you.	Siif jedheen as jira.
We should have known.	Beekuu qabna turre.
How can I do that .	Akkamitti akkas gochuu danda'a .
It doesn’t have to feel good.	Miira gaarii qabaachuu hin qabu.
Not me on the other guy.	Ana gurbaa biraa irratti miti.
By himself.	Ofii isaatiin.
This is the one.	Kun isa.
I think that's what happened here	Asitti kan ta'e akkas jedheen yaada
Clearly, it is not.	Akka hin taane ifaadha.
I hope it will be sometime soon	Yeroo muraasa booda akka ta'u abdiin qaba
It may not be the case.	Ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
If you are, the person has a good reputation.	Yoo ati taate namni sun maqaa gaarii qaba.
How many times have we been there.	Yeroo meeqa achi turre.
In my hands.	Harka koo keessa.
But the person is not right.	Garuu namni sirrii miti.
You just have to do you	Si gochuu qofa qabda
I don’t want to see what’s going on now	Amma maaltu akka jiru arguu hin barbaadu
I didn’t know what to make of myself	Maal akkan of godhu hin beeku ture
You are not his wife yet.	Ati ammallee haadha manaa isaa miti.
We have three children.	Ijoollee sadii qabna.
Probably not great.	Tarii guddaa miti.
I had high hopes for you, once	Abdii guddaa siif qaba ture, yeroo tokko
Fortunately, it doesn't have to	Akka carraa ta'ee dirqama miti
It could have been really bad.	Silaa dhuguma hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
I didn’t know any of those things	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku ture
So, we weren’t bad.	Kanaaf, nuti hamaa hin turre.
I can't really say.	Dhuguma jechuu hin danda'u.
That seemed right.	Sun sirrii fakkaata ture.
Just one problem.	Rakkoo tokko qofa.
I need to go that far	Hanga sana deemuun na barbaachisa
I want to know what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaada
Human, but more than that.	Nama, garuu kana caalaa.
Maybe we were too human.	Tarii baay'ee nama turre ta'a.
I have the same question about her eyes	Waa'ee ija ishee gaaffii wal fakkaatu qaba
I couldn’t make it work	Akka hojjetu gochuu hin dandeenye
There was no chance.	Carraan hin turre.
I thought it was just me.	Ana qofa natti fakkaate.
I said it doesn't work	Hin hojjetu jedheen
I didn’t want that.	Ani akkas hin barbaanne.
He wanted to know who that was	Sun eenyu akka taʼe beekuu barbaade
But then he didn't want to.	Sana booda garuu hin barbaanne.
He is looking for a way.	Karaa barbaadaa jira.
That’s my job.	Hojiin koo kanuma.
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do anything.	Kana jechuun homaa gochuu hin qabdu jechuu miti.
I just want to be with you tonight	Halkan kana qofa si waliin ta'uu barbaada
No one looked at her.	Namni ishee ilaale hin jiru.
I know better than to do that.	Sana gochuu caalaa ani beeka.
I didn’t want it to go that far	Hanga kana akka deemu hin barbaanne
I think you need us more	Isin caalaa nu barbaaddu natti fakkaata
We were a lot of kids.	Ijoollee baay'ee turre.
He was very good to us.	Inni baayʼee gaarii nuuf ture.
It’s really not like that.	Dhuguma akkas miti.
I can't tell.	Himuu hin danda'u.
He must know these things.	Wantoota kana beekuu qaba.
This was not a problem.	Kun rakkoo hin turre.
He knows exactly what to do	Waan godhu sirriitti beeka
Just like the duty.	Akkuma dirqama.
But not everyone is so sure.	Garuu namni hundi akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I want to know exactly where you are	Bakka jirtu sirriitti beekuu barbaada
He is doing the work.	Hojii hojjechaa jira.
I loved her so much, but she couldn't see that	Ani baay'een ishee jaalladha ture, garuu isheen kana arguu hin dandeenye
I don't mean that.	Akkas jechuu koo miti.
But I know better than that	Ani garuu kana caalaa beeka
No one is here but me.	Ana malee namni asitti hin jiru.
I thought he loved me.	Na jaallatu natti fakkaate.
I won't go before tomorrow.	Boru dura hin deemu.
Then it’s better.	Sana booda wayya.
She was a morning person.	Nama ganama turte.
They’ll be long.	Dheeraa ta’u.
But he had to work on it.	Garuu irratti hojjechuu qaba ture.
This happens sometimes.	Kun yeroo tokko tokko ni ta’a.
It was his voice and still not quite his voice.	Sagalee isaa ture ammas guutummaatti sagalee isaa miti.
There is no need to go together.	Waliin deemuun hin barbaachisu.
This happens quite often.	Kun yeroo baay’ee ta’a.
I love a little bit of this	Kana keessaa xiqqoo nan jaalladha
He said very little about you.	Waa'ee kee baay'ee xiqqoo dubbate.
I'm sure you can't go back there	Achitti deebi'uu akka hin dandeenye mirkanaa'adha
Which he is not.	Kan inni hin taane.
I didn't understand much at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baayʼee natti hin hubanne.
Of course, you cannot do that.	Akkas gochuu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
He's a good one.	Inni gaarii dha.
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I need more of them.	Isaan kana caalaa na barbaachisa.
That would work.	Sun ni hojjeta ture.
I won’t be here for long	Yeroo dheeraaf as hin jiru
I'm still not sure.	Ammallee mirkanaa'aa miti.
I knew what was happening	Waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka ture
Nobody knows much about them.	Waa'ee isaanii namni waan baay'ee beeku hin jiru.
It can't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin danda'u.
It was there, right there.	Achi ture, sirriitti achi ture.
I know it will happen.	Akka ta'u nan beeka.
They want me to go.	Akkan deemu barbaadu.
Mistakes that no longer matter	Dogoggora kana booda dhimma hin qabne
We are going to work on it.	Irratti hojjechuuf jirra.
It wasn’t bad.	Hamaa hin turre.
But you still have it.	Garuu ammallee qabda.
We hadn’t met him.	Isa waliin wal hin argine turre.
I love her, I love her.	Ishee nan jaalladha.
I think it was like that	Akkas ture jedheen yaada
I don't know how it happened	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku
I wanted nothing more to make it big	Guddaa gochuuf kana caalaa homaa hin barbaanne
It would have been easier.	Silaa salphaa ture.
Only a few	Muraasa qofa .
There is no more work.	Kana booda hojiin hin jiru.
I mean, none of this is really my thing	Kun tokkollee dhuguma waan koo miti jechuu kooti
I think he likes it more than I do	Ana caalaa waan jaallatu natti fakkaata
It happens often.	Yeroo baay’ee ni ta’a.
I have so much to tell you and so little time	Waan baay'ee sitti himuu fi yeroo xiqqoo qaba
There were many such people.	Namoonni akkasii baay'ee turan.
No lights, no pictures.	Ifa hin qabu, suuraa hin qabu.
I don't know with him	Ani isa waliin hin beeku
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
I hope we always do	Yeroo hundumaa akka goonu abdiin qaba
That will happen very soon.	Sun baayyee dhiyootti ta'a.
They say there is still hope.	Ammas abdiin jira jedhu.
I have time to think about it	Yeroon itti yaadu qaba
I knew what it was like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture
No one had seen any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee namni arge hin turre.
I know what happens with people	Namoota waliin maal akka ta'u nan beeka
A year was a long time	Waggaa tokko yeroo dheeraa ture
I had no idea if any of them worked.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee yoo hojjetu yaada hin qabu ture.
But it’s not working.	Garuu hojjechuu miti.
I need alone time with you	Yeroon kophaa koo si waliin na barbaachisa
He tried it on her.	Ishee irratti yaale.
I want to know what it’s like	Maal akka fakkaatu beekuu barbaada
I have been there.	Ani achi tureera.
She did what she did.	Waan goote goote.
I love that good feeling	Miira gaarii sana nan jaalladha
I certainly wasn’t a good person	Ani nama gaarii akkan hin turre beekamaadha
Someone came out.	Namni tokko ba'e.
It can’t be both ways.	Karaa lamaan ta’uu hin danda’u.
But they know it exists.	Garuu akka jiru ni beeku.
You know what you want.	Waan barbaaddu ni beekta.
Better be the right person.	Nama sirrii ta'uu wayya.
But he didn’t do any more.	Garuu kana caalaa hin hojjenne.
He was always there.	Yeroo hundumaa achi ture.
I have no idea what is going on	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada hin qabu
It was just an idea.	Yaada qofa ture.
He gave me this.	Kana naaf kenne.
No one needed to tell me that.	Namni akkas natti himuu hin barbaachifne.
I don’t have a book here	Asitti kitaaba hin qabu
So you have to tell him.	Kanaaf itti himuu qabda.
Too late to do anything, of course.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf yeroon isaa darbe, beekamaadha.
It was easy enough to do.	Hojjechuuf salphaa gahaa ture.
I know he cares a lot about this issue	Dhimma kanaaf baay'ee akka yaadu nan beeka
You just have to be more than one guy.	Gurbaa tokko caalaa ta'uu qofa qabda.
It wasn’t clear.	Ifa hin turre.
I wasn't sure that would work.	Sun akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I thought it was everything.	Waan hundumaa natti fakkaate.
I must be going.	Ani deemaa jiraachuu qaba.
We need to work together.	Waliin hojjechuu qabna.
I said there was	Anis ni jira jedheen
It's just that it's one.	Tokko ta'uu isaa qofa.
I still couldn’t believe he was with me	Ammallee inni na waliin akka jiru amanuu hin dandeenye
I can do it again.	Ammas gochuu nan danda'a.
I think maybe it is.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada.
I wanted to give you that opportunity	Carraa sana siif kennuu barbaade
I don’t have anyone to tell.	Nama itti himu hin qabu.
It was my mother.	Haadha koo ture.
I love him very, very much	Ani baay'een baay'een isa jaalladha
They shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qaban.
I think someone told me something.	Namni tokko waan tokko natti hime natti fakkaata.
Afterwards? 	Sana booda?
It took me a year to do that one.	Isa sana hojjechuuf waggaa tokko natti fudhate.
There should be none of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee jiraachuu hin qabu.
I knew it was too easy	Garmalee salphaa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
I know it's really long but that's how it happened.	Dhuguma dheeraa akka ta'e nan beeka garuu akkasitti ta'e.
There was no time for school.	Yeroon mana barumsaa hin turre.
Here I had him, soon to be alone	Asitti isa qaba ture, yeroo dhiyootti kophaa koo ta'uuf
It doesn’t mean he didn’t want you.	Si hin barbaanne jechuu miti.
Looks like they have enough space.	Bakka gahaa qaban fakkaata.
I have to admit, everything is going well	Ani amanuu qaba, wanti hundi akka gaariitti deemaa jira
Couldn't be so lucky	Akkas carraa qabaachuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t really think about it	Dhuguma itti hin yaadne
A guy who isn’t even interested	Gurbaa fedhii illee hin qabne
I think you’re really interested	Dhuguma fedhii qabda jedheen yaada
There were three of us.	Sadii turre.
One was a boy.	Tokko gurbaa ture.
You still don’t know anything, but you know you don’t know anything.	Ammallee homaa hin beektu, garuu homaa akka hin beekne beekta.
I didn't know it was true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa hin beeku ture.
I was in no mood to do anything	Ani homaa hojjechuuf miira hin qabu ture
I didn’t intend to do any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee gochuuf hin yaadne
I have no feelings for him.	Miira hin qabu isaaf.
But he thought, now, about his parents.	Garuu inni yaade, amma, waa'ee warra isaa.
I can do it sometime later	Yeroo tokko booda gochuu nan danda'a
Something was happening there.	Achitti wanti tokko ta'aa ture.
So there were two.	Kanaaf lama turan.
I love this picture, I always have	Suuraa kana nan jaalladha, yeroo hundumaa qaba
I might be able to give you that reason	Sababa sana siif kennuu danda'a ta'a
Nothing can get him here this day.	Guyyaa kana wanti asitti isa argachuu hin danda'u.
I have been there several times	Yeroo hedduu achi tureera
I really want him now	Amma baay'een isa barbaada
I don’t have it now.	Amma hin qabu.
I should have said new.	Silaa haaraa jechuu qaba ture.
As if it were.	Akka waan.
I should never have done it.	Silaa gonkumaa gochuu hin qabu ture.
Nothing is voiceless.	Wanti sagalee hin qabne hin jiru.
Everything will be great.	Wanti hundi guddaa ta'a.
The reason should be obvious	Sababni isaa ifa ta'uu qaba
I sit up a little	Xiqqoo ol jedheen taa'a
The right situation.	Haala sirrii ta’e.
I’m doing better than that.	Ani kana caalaa hojjechaa jira.
That seemed all too real, though.	Sun garuu baayʼee dhugaa fakkaata ture.
Just something about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan tokko qofa.
I didn’t want to give it to you	Siif kennuu hin barbaanne
I hope it helps.	Akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I think it's language, though.	Afaan natti fakkaata garuu.
I had no idea who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
Fortunately, there were no problems.	Akka carraa ta'ee rakkoon tokkollee hin turre.
I didn’t quite know how to say it.	Akkamitti akka jedhu sirriitti hin beeku ture.
He probably didn’t have it.	Inni tarii hin qabu ture.
I don't need it.	Na hin barbaachisu.
But nothing came of it.	Garuu wanti dhufe hin jiru.
I know all this well	Kana hunda sirriitti beeka
This may be a necessary time but it is not enough.	Yeroon kun yeroo barbaachisaa ta'uu danda'a garuu gahaa miti.
A little thing, really	Waan xiqqoo, dhuguma
He was not at the accident	Balaa sanatti hin turre
Even if it just happened this morning.	Ganama kana qofa ta'e illee.
We mean.	Nuti jechuun.
He took one.	Tokko fudhate.
He had a reason to tell her.	Sababa itti himu qaba ture.
We are the same.	Nuti kanuma.
It shouldn’t help you	Si gargaaruu hin qabu
They may be right.	Isaan sirrii taʼuu dandaʼu.
It had already happened.	Duraan ta'ee ture.
He already knows the answer of course	Deebii isaa duruu beeka beekamaadha
Man has a small house	Namni mana xiqqoo qaba
I didn’t know them well	Ani sirriitti isaan hin beeku ture
But you don’t do it like that.	Garuu akkasitti hin gootu.
Only you have this answer.	Deebii kana kan qabdu si qofa.
I could do nothing else	Waan biraa gochuu hin dandaʼu ture
I thought it was really good.	Dhuguma gaarii natti fakkaate.
Which he was looking for.	Kan inni barbaadaa ture.
Then the moment came as she knew it would.	Sana booda yeroon sun akkuma isheen beektu dhufe.
No two ways about it.	Karaa lama hin qabu waa'ee isaa.
There is still a chance it could come back to us.	Ammas carraan nutti deebi'uu danda'u jira.
I mean, they want me	Na barbaadu jechuu kooti
I hope there is.	Akka jiru abdiin qaba.
That’s all I want to say	Kana qofa jechuu barbaada
I mean the real thing	Waan dhugaa jechuu kooti
I'm much more than that.	Ani baay'ee kana caalaa.
I didn't think it was anything too special	Waan garmalee adda ta'e natti hin fakkaatu ture
I know, you didn’t mean it	Ani beeka, jechuu kee hin turre
He has to help his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa gargaaruu qaba.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
I doubt it will happen	Akka ta'u nan shakka
I could have left him there	Silaa achitti isa dhiisuu nan danda'a ture
This seems unlikely	Kun waan hin taane fakkaata
I so want to have you here.	Ani akkasitti isin asitti qabaachuu barbaada.
But it’s not your problem.	Garuu rakkoo keessan miti.
What works for me may not work for you.	Wanti naaf hojjetu siif hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
I was sure it was him	Isa akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa ture
People often do that.	Namoonni yeroo baayʼee akkas godhu.
But now he couldn't.	Amma garuu hin dandeenye.
But it is not clear how.	Garuu akkamitti ifa miti.
I still said it was pretty good.	Ammallee baayyee gaarii jedheen ture.
I just thought you didn’t know	Ani akka ati hin beekne qofa natti fakkaate
Not a good situation.	Haala gaarii miti.
I don't know why this has to happen.	Kun maaliif ta'uu akka qabu hin beeku.
I thought he cared about me	Naaf yaadu natti fakkaate
He did something.	Waan tokko hojjete.
You can't say it.	Jechuu hin dandeessu.
I still want him	Ammallee isa barbaada
That was all it was.	Kana qofa ture.
I knew very little about him other than his name.	Maqaa isaa malee waa'ee isaa baay'ee xiqqoo beeka ture.
I looked at him inside.	Anis keessa isa ilaale.
Maybe a lot, maybe a little.	Tarii baay'ee, tarii xiqqoo.
I wondered what he was doing now	Amma maal hojjechaa jira jedheen yaade
Believe it or not.	Amanuu moo hin amanuu.
Which was not very long.	Kan baayyee dheeraa hin turre.
It’s possible that he never will.	Inni gonkumaa akka hin taane ta’uu danda’a.
It was one of his favorite things about her.	Wantoota inni ishee irraa baayʼee jaallatu keessaa tokko ture.
It was no longer his	Kana booda kan isaa hin turre
In reality.	Dhugaa jiru keessatti.
For some reason then.	Sababa tokko irraa yeroo sana.
But someone had assumed it was a mistake.	Garuu namni tokko dogoggora jedhee fudhate ture.
I didn’t realize it helped but I think so	Gargaaruu isaa hin hubanne garuu akkas jedhee yaada
I couldn't see how he could	Akkamitti akka danda'u arguu hin dandeenye
I can see it in her eyes.	Ija ishee keessaa arguu danda'a.
He got an answer.	Deebii argate.
He knew she had it.	Akka qabdu ni beeka ture.
I know people we can stay with	Namoota waliin turuu dandeenyu nan beeka
Lots of rooms.	Kutaa baay'ee.
Never have, never will.	Gonkumaa hin qabu, gonkumaa hin ta'u.
To some extent this was true.	Hamma tokko kun dhugaa ture.
Really glad to see you	Dhuguma si arguu kootti gammadeera
I didn't know you had so much in you	Waan baay'ee akka si keessa qabdu hin beeku ture
It's just not a great place anymore.	Kana booda bakka guddaa ta'uu qofa miti.
He realized I just had to get the timing right	Yeroo sirrii ta'e argachuu qofa akkan qabu hubate
He has everything.	Waan hundumaa qaba.
We have a way.	Karaa qabna.
I knew he didn’t know me	Akka na hin beekne nan beeka ture
And it will happen again.	Ammas ni ta'a.
Tell us what we can do better.	Waan kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeenyu nuuf himi.
They are in a joke.	Qoosaa keessa jiru.
It’s not just environmental conditions.	Haala naannoo qofa miti.
Except when there is.	Yeroo jiru malee.
He had no job.	Hojii hin qabu ture.
I shouldn’t have asked you that one	Silaa isa sana si gaafachuu hin qabu ture
If it does anything at all.	Yoo waan tokko hojjete tasumaa.
But I know one thing	Ani garuu waan tokko beeka
It's better to be.	Ta'uu wayya.
I couldn’t do this to her	Kana ishee irratti gochuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t feel that way before.	Duraan akkas natti hin turre.
I was sure about that	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa ture
They are.	Isaan ... dha.
I won’t need it for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf na hin barbaachisu
Most likely her father.	Baay'ee kan hin oolle abbaa ishee.
I know it can't be easy	Salphaa ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
It has more than enough space	Bakka gahaa ol qaba
He told me he would help me.	Akka na gargaaru natti hime.
Not today.	Har'a miti.
In my car.	Konkolaataa koo keessatti.
I'm with you.	Si waliin jira.
I don't think of anything else.	Waan biraa hin yaadu.
It won't be easy for you.	Siif salphaa hin ta'u.
She was expecting something.	Waan tokko eegaa turte.
I was, really.	Ani ture, dhuguma.
Everything was there.	Wanti jiru hundi achi ture.
Look at it like this.	Akkasitti ilaalaa.
I like it that way a lot	Akkasitti baayyee natti tola
Nothing else is needed.	Kan biraa hin barbaachisu.
I hoped he could handle the reality	Dhugaa jiru akka danda'u abdiin qaba ture
I know you were trying to help	Gargaaruuf yaalaa akka turte nan beeka
I was home alone all night	Halkan guutuu kophaa koo mana ture
But what she really wanted was a girl.	Garuu wanti isheen dhuguma barbaaddu intala ture.
I knew nothing about fatherhood.	Waa'ee abbaa ta'uu homaa hin beeku ture.
I just thought you should know	Beekuu qabdu qofa jedheen yaade
I know now that none of this is true	Kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa akka hin taane amma beeka
You're there.	Ati jirta.
I was the one he wanted	Ani isa inni barbaadu ture
Good on him.	Isa irratti gaarii.
He said my name.	Maqaa koo jedhe.
It just has to be.	Ta'uu qofa qaba.
He now knew what that meant	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka taʼe amma beeka ture
I am always alone, I am really alone	Yeroo hundumaa kophaa kooti, ​​dhuguma kophaa koo jira
It wants to be for you.	Siif ta'uu barbaada.
He had no chance.	Carraa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
But now none of that exists.	Garuu amma sun tokkollee hin jiru.
But someone was in the room with me.	Garuu namni tokko kutaa sana keessa na waliin ture.
I don't know what to do	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku
It wasn’t until.	Hanga hin turre.
So much much more.	Kanaaf baayyee baay'ee caalaa.
Man on man.	Namni nama irratti.
I really like this school.	Mana barumsaa kana baay'een jaalladha.
I, of course, was constantly staring at her.	Ani, yeroo hunda ija keessa ishee ilaalaa akkan ture beekamaadha.
I think it was necessary	Barbaachisaa ture jedheen yaada
I don't think so.	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu.
He was making a terrible mistake.	Dogoggora hamaa hojjechaa ture.
I'm a guy.	Ani gurbaa dha.
I wonder why that is	Maaliif akkas ta'e jedheen yaada
Look into his eyes.	Ija isaa keessa ilaalaa.
Night and day.	Halkan fi guyyaa.
Full time.	Yeroo guutuu.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
She was that good.	Isheen akkas gaarii turte.
I'm not the one.	Ani miti.
This was all good for me	Kun hundi naaf gaarii ture
I knew he loved me.	Akka na jaallatu nan beeka ture.
He didn't know why he did that	Maaliif akkas akka godhe hin beeku ture
She had no hope.	Abdii tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
That could just be me.	Sun ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
It should work well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechuu qaba.
I mean, you have to be real about it	Waa'ee kanaa dhugaa ta'uu qabda jechuu kooti
I will always love you	Yeroo hundumaa si jaalladha
I wouldn’t want to do anything else.	Ani waan biraa hojjechuu hin barbaadu ture.
Maybe it doesn't.	Tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
No one asked them.	Namni isaan gaafate hin jiru.
He had not seen the light for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ifa hin argine ture
But that wasn’t his problem.	Garuu rakkoon isaa sun hin turre.
I really don’t want to know.	Dhuguma beekuu hin barbaadu.
Nothing out there today does that.	Har'a wanti ala jiru tokkollee akkas godhu hin jiru.
I shouldn’t be around you	Ani naannoo kee jiraachuu hin qabu
As we have it.	Akkuma qabnu.
It must be great.	Guddaa ta'uu qaba.
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
I really didn’t know what to say	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
I love life on the road	Jireenya karaa irra jiru nan jaalladha
I think you already know why	Maaliif akka ta'e duruu beektu jedheen yaada
He was always here	Yeroo hundumaa as ture
Not sure that's a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
This wasn’t working.	Kun hojjechaa hin turre.
He’s not a bad guy, really.	Inni nama hamaa miti, dhuguma.
I think she meant it against her	Ishee irratti jechuu ishee natti fakkaata
I wish it happened more often	Yeroo baay'ee osoo ta'ee natti tola
But it happened.	Garuu ta'e.
Then sometimes .	Sana booda yeroo tokko tokko .
That would be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'a.
I didn't tell him	Ani itti hin himne
It doesn't have to do much.	Baay'ee hojjechuu hin qabu.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammadeera.
Right in your eyes.	Sirriitti ija keessan keessa.
He has to believe it.	Inni amanuu qaba.
I want to do these things	Wantoota kana hojjechuu nan barbaada
You have to help him.	Isa gargaaruu qabda.
I hope there is none of this.	Kana keessaa homaa akka hin jirre abdiin qaba.
I became the father of my life	Ani abbaa jireenya koo ta'e
I wasn’t going to do it	Ani gochuuf hin turre
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo miti.
It was you.	Si ture.
I think it would be a great, great thing.	Waan guddaa, guddaa ta'a jedheen yaada.
I can't help you there	Achitti si gargaaruu hin danda'u
I could live without them	Isaan malee jiraachuu nan danda'a ture
We are two people.	Nuti nama lama.
None of it was needed.	Tokkollee hin barbaachifne.
I didn’t know anyone there	Nama achi jiru hin beeku ture
That was no problem.	Sun rakkoo hin qabu ture.
I could even tell you about it	Waa'ee isaa illee sitti himuu nan danda'a ture
I think it can do a lot of good	Gaarii guddaa hojjechuu danda'a jedheen yaada
I'm looking for that.	Sana barbaadaa jira.
Then I can do it twice.	Sana booda yeroo lama gochuu nan danda'a.
I want to do something different	Waan adda ta'e hojjechuu barbaada
I was so happy to find it.	Argachuu kootti baay'een gammade.
I do, more than you think	Ani nan godha, waan ati yaaddu caalaa
I didn’t know what to tell him.	Waan itti himu hin beeku ture.
I hope you think so, Dad.	Akkas akka yaaddu abdiin qaba abbaa.
That working day.	Guyyaa hojii sana.
We can’t do that.	Nuti akkas gochuu hin dandeenyu.
I don't know exactly what it is.	Sirriitti maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
We have to do something.	Waan hojjechuu qabna.
There is a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni jira.
I need two shoes real bad.	Kophee lama na barbaachisa dhugaa hamaa.
I thought it might be you	Si ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
you must come to me.	gara koo dhufuu qabda.
It hadn’t worked.	Hin hojjenne ture.
No sense of what is right.	Miira waan sirrii ta'e hin qabu.
How did you say it.	Akkamitti jette.
I don’t mean any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee jechuu koo miti.
He was a great guy.	Inni gurbaa guddaa ture.
This says a lot.	Kun waan baay'ee dubbata.
You go together.	Waliin deemtu.
Maybe it should be.	Tarii ta'uu qaba.
I don’t know what the reason was	Sababni isaa maal akka ture hin beeku
Her feelings.	Miira ishee.
I didn't want to talk to anyone right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana namatti dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
I just didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu qofa hin beeku ture
You know it’s not.	Akka hin taane ni beekta.
Where would he have gone? 	Silaa eessa deema ture?
. . . .	.
I know him very well	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka
Maybe he had.	Tarii qaba ture ta'a.
Maybe two in the morning.	Tarii ganama sa'aatii lama ta'uu danda'a.
Work, work, work.	Hojii, hojii, hojii.
On our way home.	Karaa keenya gara manaatti.
He said sorry again.	Ammas dhiifama jedhe.
But he wouldn’t do it.	Garuu hin godhu ture.
We’ve been friends for a long time.	Hiriyyoota yeroo dheeraaf turre.
They couldn’t do enough for us.	Isaan gahaa nuuf gochuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe they should have.	Tarii qabaachuu qabu ta'a.
But no one can know everything.	Garuu namni tokkollee waan hundumaa beekuu hin danda'u.
They had no children	Ijoollee hin qaban turan
We’re just old friends.	Nuti hiriyyoota durii qofa.
I knew you were special	Ati adda ta'uu kee nan beeka ture
We did something together.	Waan tokko waliin hojjenne.
It should be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu qaba.
But maybe they are.	Garuu tarii isaan.
But we need to find something.	Garuu waan tokko argachuu qabna.
He should have known better	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture
They could have done better with him.	Silaa isa waliin akka gaariitti hojjechuu danda'u turan.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
I couldn’t ask for anything anymore.	Kana booda homaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
It was on it.	Irra ture.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
I hoped everything was fine	Wanti hundi gaarii akka ta'e abdiin qaba ture
I can't have that.	Ani sana qabaachuu hin danda'u.
But even that wasn’t enough.	Garuu sun illee gahaa hin turre.
A little too much, it seems	Xiqqoo garmalee, fakkaata
I hope to work with you	Isin waliin hojjechuuf abdiin qaba
You know my situation.	Haala koo ni beekta.
That’s exactly what we did.	Nuti sirriitti kanuma goone.
I didn't quite understand what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti naaf hin galle
I haven’t seen it yet	Ammallee hin argine
But I was skeptical.	Ani garuu nan shakka ture.
He always did this before saying something important.	Waan barbaachisaa tokko dubbachuu isaa dura yeroo hundumaa kana godha ture.
I don't know why, but they do.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu ni beeku.
So now it took a lot of time.	Kanaaf amma yeroo baay'ee fudhate.
It had everything we needed.	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda qaba ture.
It all worked as you said.	Hundi akkuma ati jette hojjete.
I had no idea it was like that for so long	Yeroo dheeraa akkas ta'uu isaa yaada hin qabu ture
Up on it.	Isa irratti ol.
I know those two well	Isaan lamaan sana sirriitti beeka
He may never get another chance	Carraa biraa gonkumaa argachuu dhiisuu danda'a
I don’t understand why it doesn’t work though.	Maaliif akka hin hojjenne garuu naaf hin galle.
This was a real thing.	Kun waan dhugaa ture.
I don't say anything else	Kana malee hin jedhu
These are just a few.	Isaan kun muraasa qofa.
It's not mine.	Kan koo miti.
I have to do this now	Kana amma gochuun qaba
Not today, I can't come now	Har'a miti amma dhufuu hin danda'u
He always does very badly.	Yeroo hunda baayyee hamaa ni hojjeta.
Maybe that will be good for us.	Tarii sun nuuf gaarii ta'a.
He's good at that.	Inni sana irratti ga'umsa qaba.
Everyone who goes with them.	Kan isaan waliin deemu hunda.
I didn't have a lot of space	Bakka baay'ee hin qabu ture
I already know what happened	Waan ta'e duruu beeka
I hope it exists and is still waiting for me	Jiraachuu fi ammallee na eegaa akka jiru abdiin qaba
Very good condition.	Haala baayyee gaarii dha.
Not two.	Lama miti.
I think it will come in time.	Yeroo booda waan dhufu natti fakkaata.
I couldn't be either	Anis ta'uu hin dandeenye
He wanted to.	Inni barbaade.
I think probably probably.	Tarii ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada.
I didn’t want to do any of those things	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee gochuu hin barbaanne
This is not my dress	Kun uffata koo miti
Just this morning.	Ganama kana qofa.
When it didn’t work.	Yeroo hin hojjenne.
I can't talk about it	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
It can’t be true.	Dhugaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
I think not talking	Dubbachuu dhiisuu natti fakkaata
Look at another one.	Kan biraa ilaalaa.
It may still be the case.	Ammas akkas ta'uu danda'a.
It was what it was.	Waan ture ture.
I should know more about it	Waa'ee isaa caalaatti beekuu qaba
I thought about my mother	Waa'ee haadha kootti yaade
Better than nothing.	Homaa hin taane irra wayya.
I couldn't find it	Argachuu hin dandeenye
Might do that sometime this week	Torban kana yeroo tokko akkas gochuu danda'a
They will be on your car.	Konkolaataa keessan irra ni ta'u.
I still couldn’t see her	Ammallee ishee arguu hin dandeenye
It does the job.	Hojii hojjeta.
We are human beings.	Nuti nama dha.
I just thought you needed to know the facts	Dhugaa jiru beekuu qabdu qofa jedheen yaade
I couldn't go back any further.	Kana caalaa duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
I couldn't have helped you	Silaa si gargaaruu hin danda'u ture
That’s just how it works for us.	Akkasitti qofa nuuf hojjeta.
I mean really really bad.	Dhuguma dhuguma hamaa jechuu kooti.
Maybe that didn’t matter.	Tarii sun homaa hin qabu ture.
It still wasn’t three.	Ammallee sadii hin turre.
I’m not with them anymore	Kana booda isaan waliin hin jiru
I just can't buy that	Sana bitachuu qofa hin danda'u
Only once.	Yeroo tokko qofa.
Too much forgiveness.	Garmalee dhiifama.
I should have said it a long time ago	Silaa amma dura yeroo dheeraa jechuu qaba ture
I love goodwill	Fedhii gaarii nan jaalladha
I shouldn’t have even gotten the job	Silaa hojii sana illee argachuu hin qabu ture
I had someone in there with me.	Nama achi keessa na waliin qaba ture.
He thought about it for a moment before answering.	Deebii kennuu isaa dura yeroo muraasaaf itti yaade.
I think you can see what he can do.	Waan inni gochuu danda'u arguu dandeessu jedheen yaada.
I just can't believe it's true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa qofa amanuu hin danda'u
He looked at his own hand.	Harka ofii ilaale.
It couldn’t have been otherwise.	Silaa akkas ta’uu hin danda’u ture.
Did this really happen?, he says.	Dhuguma kun ta'ee?, jedha.
That’s one reason.	Sun sababa tokko.
I couldn’t tell you that.	Ani akkas sitti himuu hin dandeenye.
But they have one thing in common.	Garuu waan wal fakkaatu tokko qabu.
But only you can have it.	Garuu kan qabaachuu danda'u si qofa.
It was an important part of it.	Kutaa isaa isa barbaachisaa ture.
He doesn’t have to know anyone is around.	Namni naannoo isaa akka jiru beekuu hin qabu.
I can't say this enough	Kana gahaa jechuu hin danda'u
They want opportunities.	Carraa barbaadu.
Myself, myself, just us.	Ofii, ofii koo, nu qofa.
Perhaps this is what he needs to do.	Tarii wanta inni gochuu qabu kana taʼuu dandaʼa.
I mean, it wasn’t even a question	Gaaffii illee hin turre jechuu kooti
But of course he thought so.	Garuu beekamaadha akkas jedhee yaadu ture.
But she had feelings about that.	Garuu waa'ee sanaa miira qabdi turte.
It was there but she just couldn’t see it.	Achi ture garuu isheen arguu hin dandeenye qofa.
But how does all that really matter.	Garuu sun hundi akkamitti dhuguma dhimma qaba.
I didn’t know they were so loud.	Akkas sagalee guddaa akka qaban hin beeku ture.
But that's what happened.	Garuu kan ta'e kanuma.
Maybe I'm wrong.	Tarii ani dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't know much about it	Waa'ee isaa baay'ee hin beeku ture
He can be truly unique.	Inni dhuguma adda taʼuu dandaʼa.
That’s not us.	Sun nu miti.
The past, they can talk about	Kan darbe, waa'ee isaa dubbachuu danda'u
I only have this part	Kutaa kana qofa qaba
That really started something.	Sun dhuguma waan tokko jalqabe.
He says he needs a job.	Hojii barbaada jedha.
We have a very good idea though.	Yaada baayyee gaarii qabna garuu.
I wanted to go.	Ani deemuu barbaade.
That has to come from within.	Sun keessaa dhufuu qaba.
Isn't that really the best?!.	Dhuguma sun hunda caalaa hin ta'uu?!.
I’m just watching him walk the dog	Ani osoo inni saree sana deemu qofa ilaalaa jira
Now tell me what happened.	Amma waan ta'e natti himi.
You've only been here two hours.	Sa'aatii lama qofa as turte.
I’m not that guy.	Ani gurbaa sana miti.
I used to love him a lot	Duraan baay'een isa jaalladha ture
I have no intention of doing that	Ani akkas gochuuf yaada hin qabu
I looked away.	Anis gara biraa ilaale.
I can't do that kind of thing	Waan akkasii hojjechuu hin danda'u
I know she wants to tell you herself	Ofii ishee sitti himuu akka barbaaddu nan beeka
But it was a mistake.	Garuu dogoggora ture.
But we can’t do it without you.	Garuu isin malee gochuu hin dandeenyu.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
I still can't talk about it	Ammallee waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
You should have asked someone to tell you your duties.	Silaa nama tokko dirqama kee akka sitti himu gaafachuu qabda turte.
He had to talk to him about that.	Waa'ee sanaa itti dubbachuu qaba ture.
But everyone knew what he was and who he was.	Garuu namni hundi maal akka ta'ee fi eenyu akka ta'e beeka ture.
He didn’t know what to do with them.	Maal akka isaan godhu hin beeku ture.
Maybe they should have.	Tarii qabaachuu qabu.
I had no way of knowing if it was morning or night.	Ganama moo halkan ta’uu isaa karaa itti beeku hin qabu ture.
I hope that.	Abdii kooti akka.
It was just bad luck.	Carraa hamaa qofa ture.
I don't have an answer right now.	Yeroo ammaa deebii itti hin qabu.
It was none of their business.	Dhimma isaanii tokkollee hin turre.
I didn’t do that stuff	Ani waan sana hin hojjenne
I didn’t even see him.	Isa illee hin argine.
Clearly, I was in a different situation.	Haala adda taʼe keessa akkan ture ifaadha.
Except for that one time.	Yeroo tokko sana malee.
Not a wife rather than a husband.	Abbaa manaa irra haadha manaa miti.
But I couldn't believe it	Ani garuu amanuu hin dandeenye
He couldn’t do that.	Inni akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I didn't want to stay there	Bakka sana turuu hin barbaanne
I'm still not sure why	Maaliif akka ta'e ammallee mirkanaa'aa miti
But perhaps that would be a good thing.	Tarii garuu sun waan gaarii taʼa.
I hope it helps you.	Akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I don’t want this anymore	Kana booda kana hin barbaadu
I have no idea if that is true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu isaa yaada hin qabu.
I was a good guy.	Ani gurbaa gaarii ture.
He didn’t have enough truth	Dhugaa gahaa hin qabu ture
I didn’t know it before	Kanaan dura hin beeku ture
Not such a good idea.	Yaada gaarii akkasii miti.
I know it, I know it.	Ani nan beeka.
I still wasn't too sure	Ammallee baay'ee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I knew that was not the case	Akkas akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I began to speak.	Anis dubbachuu jalqabe.
I can’t seem to help her	Ishee gargaaruu waanan hin dandeenye fakkaata
It's okay if you don't want to tell me why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yoo natti himuu hin barbaanne homaa miti.
It looked like a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii fakkaata ture.
I think he just likes to say that	Akkas jechuu qofa waan jaallatu natti fakkaata
I don’t even know anymore.	Kana booda illee hin beeku.
I want to do this	Kana gochuu nan barbaada
No one else has met this person.	Namni biraa nama kanaan wal arge hin jiru.
There was nothing else we could do.	Wanti biraa gochuu dandeenyu hin turre.
In the past.	Yeroo darbe.
He knew that feeling too well	Miira sana garmalee sirriitti beeka ture
I saw him go this way	Karaa kanaan deemuu isaa arge
I just don't care.	Ani garuu dhimma hin qabu qofa.
I have known you for a very long time	Yeroo baayyee dheeraaf si beeka
He came on his own.	Inni ofii isaatiin dhufe.
He wanted to know a lot	Waan baay'ee beekuu barbaade
Nothing else happened.	Wanti biraa hin taane.
Good afternoon.	Waaree booda gaarii.
I can believe a lot of what he says.	Waan inni jedhu baay'een amanuu danda'a.
I think it’s a good one	Kan gaarii dha jedheen yaada
I think that's probably true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada.
We still need them	Ammas isaan barbaachisa
He had to work.	Hojjechuu qaba ture.
I knew it was my father	Abbaa koo ta'uu isaa nan beeka ture
Nothing can have it.	Wanti qabaachuu danda'u hin jiru.
I think that’s all you really need to know	Dhuguma beekuu qabdu kana qofa jedheen yaada
I certainly know them	Ani akkan isaan beeku beekamaadha
He didn’t need to.	Inni hin barbaachifne.
I want to be somewhere else, somewhere other than here.	As malee bakka biraa, bakka biraa ta'uu barbaada.
I want to go with you.	Si waliin deemuu barbaada.
This is not what happened.	Kun waan ta'e miti.
Really very .	Dhuguma baayyee .
I would never love with him	Ani gonkumaa isa waliin hin jaalladhu ture
We haven’t met, of course.	Wal hin argine beekamaadha.
I needed a job and money	Hojii fi maallaqa na barbaachisa ture
That was just great.	Sun waan guddaa qofa ture.
But they didn’t understand.	Garuu hin hubanne turan.
I doubt we can.	Akka dandeenyu nan shakka.
It will be clear soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti ifa ta'a.
We talked a little bit.	Xiqqoo dubbanne.
I would love your feedback.	Yaada keessan baay'een jaalladha.
This one was new.	Inni kun haaraa ture.
It's not a return.	Deebi'uu miti.
You need it.	Si barbaachisa.
But I know you're doing the right thing	Waan gaarii ta'e akka gootu garuu nan beeka
As far as I'm concerned.	Hanga kootti.
I'm really very sorry.	Dhuguma baayyee dhiifama.
One has to help one another.	Namni nama gargaaruu qaba.
I think it’s a great idea	Yaada guddaa natti fakkaata
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
not sure how to do this.	akkamitti akka kana godhu mirkanaa’aa miti.
She said sorry	Dhiifama jettee .
I can't live with that	Sana waliin jiraachuu hin danda'u
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
They know what it looks like.	Maal akka fakkaatu ni beeku.
He shouldn’t have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture
I think you’ll love it	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
This now became clear to him.	Kun amma ifa isaaf ta’e.
That’s how it should work.	Akkasitti hojjechuu qaba.
You two look alike.	Isin lamaan wal fakkaattu.
I was fairly certain of her answer.	Deebii ishee irratti hamma tokko mirkanaa'aa ture.
I should have asked if she was an adult	Silaa nama guddaa taate jedhee gaafachuu qaba ture
I always know what it says	Yeroo hundumaa maal akka jedhu nan beeka
It looked too good to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii fakkaata ture.
Your father.	Abbaa kee.
Before that, there is nothing.	Sana dura homaa hin jiru.
You can’t help yourself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
Not more than he saw himself.	Of arge caalaa miti.
I can't say what it is	Maal akka ta'e dubbachuu hin danda'u
They will be very different.	Baayyee adda ta'u.
I feel much better today	Har'a baayyee naaf wayya
He is no longer with us.	Kana booda nu bira hin jiru.
We need to talk about this.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu qabna.
I quickly looked around	Dafee naannoo koo ilaale
We weren’t really all there	Dhuguma hunda achi hin turre
But you don't do that.	Ati garuu waan akkasii hin gootu.
I couldn’t just go with him	Isa waliin qofa deemuu hin dandeenye
I think she needs it	Ishee barbaachisa jedheen yaada
That had to be funny.	Sun qoosaa ta'uu qaba ture.
I didn’t talk to him	Isa waliin hin dubbanne
I just didn't want it to happen in my room	Kutaa koo keessatti akka ta'u qofa hin barbaanne
I don’t know, really.	Hin beeku, dhuguma.
I wouldn't be able to tell you	Silaa sitti himuu hin danda'u ture
He is a human being.	Inni nama.
I didn’t know all this	Kana hunda hin beeku ture
This one is.	Inni kun.
She was with some friends.	Hiriyyoota tokko tokko waliin turte.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
It could never do enough	Gonkumaa gahaa ta’ee hojjechuu hin dandeenye
I will do the same again.	Ammas akkas nan godha.
Just an hour later.	Sa'aatii tokko booda qofa.
I’m really not that interested in it.	Dhuguma hangas itti fedhii hin qabu.
That's all that happened.	Sun hundi ta'e.
Little by little.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo.
I don’t think he got one.	Tokko waan argate natti hin fakkaatu.
I only walked this road once in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti yeroo tokko qofa karaa kana irra deeme.
He needs an answer.	Deebii barbaada.
But it was just one of those things.	Garuu wantoota sana keessaa tokko qofa ture.
I think that would have been the case	Silaa akkas ta'a ture jedheen yaada
This was just another one.	Kun kan biraa qofa ture.
They may be waiting for him.	Isaan isa eegaa jiraachuu dandaʼu.
I am not enough.	Ani gahaa miti.
Some really good ideas.	Yaada dhuguma gaarii tokko tokko.
He was trying to help the situation	Haala jiru gargaaruuf yaalaa ture
Which we can do.	Kan gochuu dandeenyu.
You can just do you now.	Amma qofa si gochuu dandeessa.
This was his father.	Kun abbaa isaa ture.
A very lucky man.	Nama baayyee carraa qabu.
It still wasn’t enough.	Ammas gahaa hin turre.
That’s why I’m here.	Kanaaf as jira.
It just seemed too long.	Baayyee dheeraa qofa fakkaata ture.
I didn’t know what to say then	Yeroo sana maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
I thought it shouldn’t work	Hojjechuu hin qabu jedheen yaade
That’s important to us.	Sun nuuf barbaachisaa dha.
I can't see you anymore	Kana booda si arguu hin danda'u
But that’s one thing.	Garuu sun waan tokko.
You know we can do it.	Akka gochuu dandeenyu ni beektu.
If this is so.	Yoo kun akkas ta'e.
That he needs help.	Gargaarsa akka isa barbaachisu.
I just thought it might be good	Tarii gaarii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade qofa
I need an answer.	Deebii na barbaachisa.
This is probably not what you want.	Kun tarii waan ati barbaaddu miti.
I want to ask what that means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e gaafachuu barbaada.
We had to do it again	Ammas gochuu qabna turre
I can't believe she was my teacher	Barsiisaa koo akka turte amanuu hin danda'u
The then and there.	Kan yeroo sanaa fi achi.
Nothing like it here.	Wanti asitti fakkaatu hin jiru.
You can tell, you know.	Himuu dandeessa, beekta.
He must know his place.	Bakka isaa beekuu qaba.
Except my father's life	Jireenya abbaa koo malee
Having an issue though.	Dhimma qabaachuu garuu.
It’s my hand.	Harka kooti.
He must have help.	Gargaarsa qabaachuu qaba.
They were good.	Isaan gaarii turan.
It worked for me.	Naaf hojjete.
He just went out for a few things	Waan muraasaaf qofa ba'e
I thought you were different.	Ati adda natti fakkaate.
Quick is a good amount.	Dafee hamma gaarii dha.
That was two years ago.	Sun waggaa lama dura ture.
Inside the work.	Hojii keessaa.
I hadn’t seen her like this in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkasitti ishee hin argine ture
I need some money.	Maallaqa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
Only for a moment though.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa garuu.
I'm not entirely sure why it's so important.	Maaliif akkas barbaachisaa akka ta'e guutummaatti hin beeku.
I knew what that meant	Kana jechuun maal akka taʼe nan beeka ture
He must be so lucky	Akkas carraa qabaachuu qaba
In this case two of them.	Haala kana keessatti isaan keessaa lama.
I didn't know if that was good or bad	Sun gaarii fi hamaa ta'uu hin beeku ture
I'm just a human being.	Ani nama qofa.
They are the same age.	Umuriin isaanii tokko.
It gave me something to think about.	Waan itti yaadu naaf kenne.
It’s not that bad.	Akkas hamaa miti.
None of this seems entirely true to me yet.	Kun tokkollee hanga ammaatti guutummaatti dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu.
I told him it was a mistake	Dogoggora jedheen itti hime
When it happens, it must be outside the car.	Yeroo ta'u konkolaataa ala ta'uu qaba.
I think it seems to me	Natti fakkaata jedheen yaada
I don’t even know what it was.	Maal akka ture illee hin beeku.
I know it will go with me	Na waliin akka deemu nan beeka
We need to be clear about it.	Waa'ee isaa ifa ta'uu qabna.
He was so special.	Inni akkas adda ture.
He knew exactly what she was thinking.	Waan isheen yaaddu sirriitti beeka ture.
It will go again.	Ammas ni deema.
I didn’t have time to think about it	Yeroon itti yaadu hin qabu ture
That is our job.	Hojiin keenya kanuma.
But then, of course, of course not.	Garuu sana booda, beekamaadha, akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He spoke too much.	Garmalee dubbate.
It seems she never saw him again.	Kana booda waan isa hin argine fakkaata.
I know what this is.	Kun maal akka ta'e nan beeka.
When you think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu.
I can't say exactly when it started.	Yoom akka jalqabe sirriitti dubbachuu hin danda'u.
One with a full voice.	Tokko sagalee guutuu qabu.
I only saw them yesterday	Kaleessa qofa isaan arge
I haven’t told anyone yet	Hanga ammaatti namatti hin himne
They knew each other, they loved each other.	Wal beeku, wal jaallatu turan.
Being a father's daughter.	Intala abbaa ta'uu.
We had several of them in the house.	Mana keessa hedduu isaanii qabna turre.
Nothing is certain.	Wanti mirkanaa'aa ta'e hin jiru.
Probably more than you need to know.	Tarii waan beekuu qabdu caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
But nobody really knows.	Garuu dhuguma namni beeku hin jiru.
They have a terrible reputation.	Maqaa gaarii hamaa qabu.
You are absolutely correct.	Ati guutummaatti sirrii dha.
Not only that, but.	Kana qofa osoo hin taane.
He just couldn't do it.	Inni qofa hin danda'u ture.
We have to stay there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi turuu qabna.
That hasn’t happened yet in the long run.	Sun yeroo dheeraa keessatti ammallee hin taane.
That’s not the same thing.	Sun waan tokko miti.
That was a really good thing.	Sun dhuguma waan gaarii ture.
I was looking for some work	Hojii tokko tokko barbaadaa ture
It’s just my luck.	Carraa koo qofa.
They know this.	Isaan kana ni beeku.
Except that she wasn’t one.	Isheen tokko akka hin turre malee.
He was doing me a favor	Inni tola naaf gochaa ture
But it didn’t look like one.	Garuu tokko hin fakkaatu ture.
I didn’t intend to do that	Ani akkas gochuuf hin yaadne
I want you to go here tonight	Halkan kana akka as deemtu barbaada
He was pretty sure this was what he had.	Inni waan inni qabu kana ta'uu isaa baay'ee mirkanaa'aa ture.
There was no one else in the waiting room.	Kutaa eegaa keessa namni biraa hin turre.
See what happens.	Waan ta'u ilaalaa.
We have a hand in everything	Waan hundumaa keessa harka qabna
I just wasn't sure what it was	Maaltu akkas ta'e qofa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I shouldn't talk about it	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin qabu
I mean, I mean.	Jechuun kooti.
I am not so lucky.	Ani akkas carraa hin qabu.
I knew she probably was	Tarii akka turte nan beeka ture
He would have wanted to	Silaa iyyuu barbaada ture
It worked well for me.	Akka gaariitti naaf hojjete.
No one can get anything.	Namni homaa argachuu hin danda'u.
Once upon a time.	Yeroo tokko.
I know this is the right guy	Kun gurbaa sirrii ta'uu isaa nan beeka
I have a few on hand	Muraasa harka kootti qaba
This will be a lot.	Kun baay'ee ta'a.
I know where it is	Bakka jiru nan beeka
I didn’t want to live anymore	Kana booda jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I thought that was a good thing	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaate
It just didn’t do it for me.	Naaf hin goone qofa.
He didn’t have a job, he didn’t work.	Hojii hin qabu ture, hojii hin hojjenne.
I will do this alone	Kana kophaa koo nan godha
He didn't want him to be alone	Kophaa isaa akka ta'u hin barbaanne
I don't know then.	Ani yeroo sana hin beeku.
Until.	Hamma.
I think he was in a bad situation	Haala hamaa keessa ture natti fakkaata
So, he took someone else.	Kanaaf, nama biraa fudhate.
I think you should do that	Akkas gochuu qabda jedheen yaada
It wants to be all around you	Naannoo kee hunda ta'uu barbaada
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
We can’t tell.	Himuu hin dandeenyu.
But things were looking up.	Garuu wanti jiru ol ilaalaa ture.
But maybe I don't need one.	Tarii garuu tokko na hin barbaachisu ta'a.
I can't see what the problem is from here	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e as irraa arguu hin danda'u
That doesn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu.
Didn't think about that for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne.
Today is your day.	Har'a guyyaa keessan.
That was a mistake, of course.	Sun dogoggora akka ture beekamaadha.
I have no idea what to say	Waan jedhu yaada hin qabu
So, I think I can be forgiven	Kanaaf, dhiifama argachuu danda’a jedheen yaada
But it’s not as simple as that.	Garuu akka sanaa salphaa miti.
I'm sure on that one.	Isa sana irratti mirkanaa'aa dha.
I can have that tomorrow	Boru sana qabaachuu nan danda'a
What really matters.	Wanti dhuguma barbaachisaa ta'e.
I just couldn’t speak	Dubbachuu qofa hin dandeenye
There is, of course.	Akka jiru beekamaadha.
I knew it wouldn’t work	Akka hin hojjenne nan beeka ture
I had a lot of work to do	Hojii baay'een qaba ture
He just loves it.	Inni qofa jaallata.
I need your help with my mom	Gargaarsa keessan haadha koo waliin barbaada
But now it is different.	Amma garuu adda.
I can't do anything good here.	Asitti waan gaarii tokkollee hojjechuu hin danda'u.
It's a good night.	Halkan gaarii dha.
I’m lucky she didn’t.	Isheen akkas hin goone carraa kooti.
I had a lot of questions about it all	Waa'ee kana hunda gaaffii baay'een qaba ture
I think that’s great	Sun waan guddaa natti fakkaata
Should be back in a while	Yeroo muraasa booda deebi'uu qaba
I thought she needed to see me more.	Isheen caalaatti na arguu qabdi jedheen yaade.
I think he knew it was that day.	Guyyaa sana akka ta'e waan beeku natti fakkaata.
I just don’t think it’s necessary	Barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu qofa
I wasn’t looking.	Ani ilaalaa hin turre.
We are in such a time now.	Amma yeroo akkasii keessa jirra.
It doesn't seem like the right time, and all.	Yeroo sirrii ta'ee hin fakkaatu, fi hunda.
I looked the other way.	Anis karaa biraa ilaale.
But it was extremely nice.	Garuu garmalee namatti tola ture.
I don't know if it will be tonight or not.	Halkan kana ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
I didn’t have time to think about it.	Yeroon itti yaadu hin qabu ture.
People love to see us play.	Namoonni taphachuu keenya arguu ni jaallatu.
It’s not what it was.	Waan ture miti.
I thought he understood	Akka waan hubate natti fakkaate
I can still do something	Ammas waan tokko hojjechuu nan danda'a
I think that’s a good answer	Sun deebii gaarii natti fakkaata
I couldn’t believe my luck	Carraa koo amanuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t see anyone	Nama tokkollee hin argine
I thought it already existed.	Duraan jira jedheen yaada ture.
That was the worst.	Sun isa hamaa ture.
Maybe I can't eat anymore.	Tarii kana booda nyaachuu hin danda'u ta'a.
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
Very very good .	Baayyee baayyee gaarii .
I know you like that	Akkas akka jaallattu nan beeka
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
So you know he can’t do anything for you.	Kanaaf homaa siif gochuu akka hin dandeenye beekta.
We are not willing to do this.	Kana gochuuf fedhii hin qabnu.
I can help you with this	Kanaan isin gargaaruu nan danda'a
It must be helpful.	Gargaarsa taʼuu qaba.
It didn’t look like anything.	Homaa hin fakkaatu ture.
You can’t be any other than yourself.	Ofii kee malee kan biraa ta’uu hin dandeessu.
People were still staring.	Namoonni ammallee ija keessa ilaalaa turan.
They could have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu danda'u turan.
She didn’t need him.	Isheen isa hin barbaachifne.
I just thought it took me	Na fudhate qofa natti fakkaate
But that’s not how it happened, not there or here.	Garuu akkasitti hin taane, achi miti as miti.
I can't leave you	Si dhiisuu hin danda'u
It wasn’t that early for him.	Isaaf hangas dafee hin turre.
But this is not true.	Garuu kun dhugaa miti.
I have exactly the same issue.	Anis sirriitti dhimma wal fakkaatu qaba.
But even that was a risk.	Garuu sun illee balaa ture.
There is no single factor that caused the accident.	Wanti balaa kanaaf sababa ta’e tokko hin jiru.
Just the reality of the moment.	Dhugaa yeroo sanaa qofa.
I didn’t know there was anyone else here	Asitti namni biraa akka jiru hin beeku ture
Not in a year.	Waggaa tokko keessatti miti.
Usually a couple of hours.	Yeroo baayyee sa'aatii lama lama.
I didn’t really know him	Dhuguma isa hin beeku ture
Not who you know.	Eenyu akka beektu miti.
You have to give it to him.	Isaaf kennuu qabda.
She was, you know.	Isheen turte, beekta.
I knew then that something was wrong	Yeroo sanatti wanti tokko dogoggora akka jiru nan beeka ture
Look at what he did.	Waan inni hojjete ilaalaa.
The past was something.	Kan darbe waan ture.
You are very lucky.	Baay'ee carraa qabda.
They could do it again, but I didn't think they would.	Ammas gochuu danda'u, garuu ni godhu jedhee hin yaadne.
I thought about it a lot.	Waa'ee kanaa baay'een yaade.
I really should know better	Dhuguma kana caalaa beekuu qaba
I wonder where she was	Eessa turte jedheen yaada
Just one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko qofa.
She doesn’t have many friends and doesn’t want anymore.	Hiriyyoota hedduu hin qabdu kana booda hin barbaaddu.
That's how you do it.	Akkasitti ni gootu.
They are all very human.	Hundi isaanii baay'ee nama.
I didn’t know what was in it	Waan keessa jiru hin beeku ture
It’s my part.	Kutaa kooti.
That’s how we did it.	Akkasitti hojjenne.
But he wants more.	Garuu kana caalaa barbaada.
This was not an entirely new concept.	Kun guutummaatti yaada haaraa hin turre.
I wish things were different	Silaa wanti adda ta'ee natti tola
I just couldn’t see her like that.	Akkasitti ishee arguu hin dandeenye qofa.
But that won't be enough.	Garuu sun gahaa hin ta'u.
Nothing just happened to it.	Homaa itti hin taane qofa.
We are going to do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuuf jirra.
It had to be his money.	Maallaqa isaa ta'uu qaba ture.
I need to give you something about me	Waa'ee koo waan tokko siif kennuu barbaachisa
I mean, look at me.	Na ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
Not days, certainly not weeks.	Guyyaa miti torban akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Your old friends.	Hiriyyoota kee durii.
I could be working for him	Ani isaaf hojjechaa jiraachuu danda'a
He had no intention of doing so	Akkas gochuuf yaada hin qabu ture
All he wants to do is help people.	Wanti inni gochuu barbaadu namoota gargaaruu qofa.
I have no idea where it is.	Eessa akka jiru yaada hin qabu.
I thought she just said that	Akkas qofa jette natti fakkaate
I always thought he was a great guy	Yeroo hundumaa gurbaa guddaa natti fakkaata ture
That's how it happened.	Akkasitti ta'e.
I need some help with this.	Kana irratti gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
Everything was wrong, he told himself.	Wanti hundi dogoggora ture jedhee ofitti hime.
But this doesn’t help.	Garuu kun hin gargaaru.
That was for a while.	Sun yeroo muraasaaf ture.
Sometimes it feels very light.	Yeroo tokko tokko miira baayyee salphaa ta'a.
It still doesn’t exist.	Ammallee hin jiru.
The man who.	Nama nama...
Hopefully this will work.	Kun akka hojjetu abdii qabna.
That they don’t work.	Isaan akka hin hojjenne.
I couldn’t find anyone	Nama argachuu hin dandeenye
Sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko.
I was just another stranger in the crowd	Ani nama biraa namoota hedduu keessaa hin beekne qofa ture
Not that it matters now, of course.	Amma dhimma qaba jechuu miti, beekamaadha.
I think it was him	Isa ture jedheen yaada
He just wants to live his life.	Jireenya isaa jiraachuu qofa barbaada.
But it is very good!.	Garuu baayyee gaarii dha!.
That's not good.	Sun gaarii miti.
I think you should leave this to me	Kana naaf dhiisuu qabdu jedheen yaada
We weren’t together for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf waliin hin turre.
I told him it wouldn’t work	Hin hojjetu jedheen itti hime
He always knows.	Yeroo hundumaa ni beeka.
I know my children better than anyone else.	Ijoollee koo hunda caalaa nan beeka.
He was very clear about that.	Waa'ee sanaa baay'ee ifa ture.
He looked him in the eye	Ija keessa isa ilaale
He's extremely positive about it.	Inni waa'ee kanaa garmalee gaarii dha.
But that’s not perfect.	Garuu sun guutuu miti.
Everything that matters.	Wanti barbaachisaa taʼe hundi.
Nothing he said seemed to help.	Wanti inni dubbate tokkollee waan gargaaru hin fakkaatu.
I certainly was once	Yeroo tokko akkan ture beekamaadha
He was doing his job.	Hojii isaa hojjechaa ture.
I have a big problem with that	Sana irratti rakkoo guddaa qaba
I like the language.	Afaan natti tola.
I couldn't believe he said that	Akkas jedhe amanuu hin dandeenye
I know the situation	Haala jiru nan beeka
I wish you would do that more often	Osoo yeroo baay'ee akkas gootu natti tola ture
Except, of course, it wasn’t.	Malee, beekamaadha, akkas hin turre.
I think he was looking at the bigger picture.	Suuraa guddaa sana ilaalaa ture natti fakkaata.
She had her answer.	Deebii ishee qabdi turte.
But that was before.	Garuu sun kanaan dura ture.
I can't get any job	Hojii tokkollee argachuu hin danda'u
Hopefully it's a good one.	Kan gaarii ta'uu abdii qabna.
It was her, and now she wasn’t.	Ishee turte, ammas hin turre.
He was like that.	Inni akkas ture.
He thought something happened.	Waan tokko ta'e yaade.
I could have helped you	Silaa si gargaaruu nan danda'a ture
I didn’t realize he was there	Achi akka jiru hin hubanne
I can still say the same thing about you	Ammas waa'ee kee kanuma jechuu nan danda'a
I know him a little better now	Amma xiqqoo caalaatti isa beeka
I'm not sure, but maybe.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti, garuu tarii.
Maybe good, maybe bad.	Tarii gaarii, tarii hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
He didn't do this.	Kana hin goone.
I can't believe she would do that to her	Akkas akka ishee gootu amanuu hin danda'u
Later maybe, but not yet.	Booda tarii, garuu ammallee hin taane.
They absolutely do.	Isaan guutummaatti ni godhu.
That's it.	Kanuma.
I didn’t know how to tell you	Akkamitti akkan sitti himu hin beeku ture
I said the same thing	Anis kanuma jedhe
I couldn't believe it was true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
I know why it comes.	Maaliif akka dhufu nan beeka.
It couldn't have been important.	Barbaachisaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I looked at him for a moment	Yeroo muraasaaf isa ilaale
I'm working on it.	Ani hojjechaa jira.
I am very, very happy	Baay'ee baay'een gammadeera
Lots of noise.	Sagalee baay'ee.
We stayed for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf turre.
You have to be someone else.	Nama biraa ta'uu qabda.
I mean hours and days	Sa'aatii fi guyyaa jechuu kooti
Everything looks pretty good.	Wanti hundi baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
I am having the same issue.	Anis dhimma wal fakkaatu qabaa jira.
I knew it, too.	Anis ni beeka ture.
Everyone in this room.	Kutaa kana keessa namni hundi.
So it can come.	Kanaaf dhufuu danda'a.
He still has a lot to do.	Ammas waan baay'ee hojjechuu qaba.
I know this person.	Nama kana nan beeka.
Not giving away any errors.	Dogoggora tokkollee kennuu miti.
But it was pretty big.	Garuu baayyee guddaa ture.
But it’s okay to say you didn’t.	Garuu hin goone jechuun homaa miti.
I never know what to say	Waan jedhu gonkumaa hin beeku
It could come anytime.	Yoomiyyuu dhufuu danda'a.
At the same time.	Kanuma waliin.
It is in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jira.
I want to know what you did.	Waan ati goote beekuu barbaada.
Sometimes I wish it was, it's not	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas ta'ee natti tola, akkas miti
He realized he knew nothing about her.	Waa'ee ishee homaa akka hin beekne hubate.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
But hope is in our hands.	Abdiin garuu harka keenya keessa jira.
I couldn’t say their names now.	Amma maqaa isaanii dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I should have told you before that	Silaa sana dura sitti himuu qaba ture
We need to find her.	Ishee argachuu qabna.
But it must be wrong.	Garuu dogoggora ta'uu qaba.
It’s still not enough.	Ammallee gahaa miti.
I thought it would be more than that	Kana caalaa ta'a jedheen yaade
I wanted to be her again	Ammas ishee ta'uu barbaade
It's just what happens.	Waan ta'u qofa.
It doesn’t look like him at all.	Homaa isa hin fakkaatu.
I'm not so in the mood for this	Ani akkasitti miira kanaaf hin jiru
That’s very likely.	Sun carraa guddaa qaba.
But I know this	Kana garuu nan beeka
I love that time of year	Yeroo waggaa sana baay'een jaalladha
I certainly thought	Ani akkan yaade beekamaadha
I can't see his work	Hojii isaa arguu hin danda'u
I can't do it.	Ani hin danda'u.
Similar to yours.	Kan kee wajjin wal fakkaata.
But tonight I didn't think it would happen	Halkan kana garuu ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
What happened.	Maal ta'e.
He didn't like to talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin jaallatu ture.
I’m not here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana as hin jiru.
It’s all in the moment.	Hundi isaa yeroo keessa jira.
I want it to happen quickly	Dafee akka ta'u nan barbaada
I couldn’t see any of it.	Tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
There is nothing they cannot do.	Wanti isaan gochuu hin dandeenye hin jiru.
This is as obvious as real life.	Kun akkuma jireenya dhugaa ifaadha.
If you didn't have a dog, you'd need it.	Osoo saree hin qabdu ta'ee si barbaachisa ture.
She never said this much.	Hanga kana jettee hin beektu.
Now I know it was a mistake.	Amma dogoggora akka ture nan beeka.
I know exactly where you are	Bakka jirtu sirriitti beeka
Really, nothing.	Dhuguma, homaa hin jiru.
That was right.	Sun sirrii ture.
But I think it’s important.	Garuu barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
I don’t mean to go like this tonight	Halkan kana akkasitti deemuuf jechuu koo miti
Not that it probably didn’t work.	Tarii hin hojjenne jechuu isaa miti.
I don't know what happened.	Maaltu akka ta'e hin beeku.
It becomes too obvious.	Garmalee ifa ta'a.
They all know this.	Hundi isaanii kana ni beeku.
That's us.	Sun nuti.
It has a feeling.	Miira qaba.
I wasn't entirely sure about it	Waa'ee kanaa guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I have a lot of questions that need answers	Gaaffii deebii barbaadu baay'een qaba
I just need to stay here for tonight	Halkan kanaaf as turuu qofa na barbaachisa
Perhaps nothing more is needed	Tarii kana caalaa wanti barbaachisu hin jiru
I am never alone with her	Ani gonkumaa kophaa koo ishee waliin hin jiru
Things were great at the time.	Yeroo sanatti wanti guddaa ture.
He wants to find me.	Na argachuu barbaada.
But you are not there.	Ati garuu hin jirtu.
I had someone around here to help me	Nama naannoo asitti na gargaaru qaba ture
They were still those people, of course.	Ammas namoota sana akka turan beekamaadha.
I wasn’t going to make it easy	Salphaa gochuuf hin turre
I'm looking at it.	Ani ilaalaa jira.
Just saw it last week	Torban darbe qofa arge
A little small, but nice	Xiqqoo xiqqoo, garuu namatti tola
I know you love that car.	Konkolaataa sana akka jaallattu nan beeka.
I knew exactly how to handle it	Akkamitti akkan qaban sirriitti beeka ture
I had no reason for that.	Sababni akkas ta'uuf hin qabu ture.
They all had their eyes on me.	Hundi isaanii ija isaanii natti qaban turan.
I absolutely love my home and my neighborhood	Mana koo fi naannoo koo guutummaatti nan jaalladha
There is nothing else I can say.	Kan biraa ani jedhu hin jiru.
I shouldn't have told him it was okay	Silaa homaa miti jedhee itti himuu hin qabu ture
I wonder if he even cares	Inni illee dhimma qabaa jedheen yaada
They didn’t have dogs.	Saree hin qaban turan.
Good question though	Gaaffii gaarii garuu
I want to know what it is	Maal akka ta'e beekuu barbaada
But I haven’t figured that out yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti sana hin hubanne.
She was what he needed.	Isheen waan isa barbaachisu turte.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Garuu waan hin hojjenne fakkaata.
I think everyone loves food	Namni hundi nyaata waan jaallatu natti fakkaata
Just tell me the truth.	Dhugaa jiru qofa natti himi.
He asked her why.	Maaliif jedhee ishee gaafate.
Mine is not going to be like that.	Kan koo akkas ta'uuf hin deemu.
I want the best for him	Waan gaarii isaaf barbaada
They want to be relevant, not just alive.	Jiraachuu qofa osoo hin taane barbaachisaa ta’uu barbaadu.
I hope it will be you	Akka isin ta'u abdiin qaba
They want more.	Kana caalaa barbaadu.
All so quickly.	Hundi akkas dafee.
I wonder what would happen in real life, if the same thing happened.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti maaltu ta'a jedheen yaada, osoo wanti wal fakkaatu ta'e.
I was trying to be funny	Qoosaa ta'uuf yaalaa ture
I don’t have it.	Ani hin qabu.
I just stared at her	Anis ija keessa ishee ilaale qofa
Another week passed.	Torban biraa darbe.
Not enough money.	Maallaqa gahaa miti.
I know exactly where she is	Bakka isheen jirtu sirriitti beeka
Sooner is a good amount, really.	Dafee hamma gaarii dha, dhuguma.
If no one else really is.	Yoo dhuguma namni biraa hin jirre.
Time no longer seemed important.	Yeroon kana booda barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu ture.
He didn't mean it	Jechuu hin barbaanne
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
It wasn’t true.	Dhugaa hin turre.
To do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf.
I have no idea how that happens.	Akkamitti akkas ta'u yaada hin qabu.
He should have told her the truth	Silaa dhugaa itti himuu qaba ture
I was evil.	Ani hamaa ture.
I didn't know that was the case	Akkas akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I wonder what he was doing in there	Achi keessa maal hojjechaa ture jedheen yaada
I don’t know how I did it but I did it.	Akkamitti akkan godhe hin beeku garuu nan godhe.
This was all too much.	Kun hundi garmalee ture.
Not a good idea.	Yaada gaarii miti.
I like this one.	Isa kana natti tola.
It’s not about getting an answer.	Deebii argachuu miti.
I didn't know any of that about you.	Waa'ee kee sana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku ture.
Now we are one.	Amma tokko taane.
I shouldn’t have had any feelings for him	Miira tokkollee isaaf qabaachuu hin qabu ture
I don’t have to.	Dirqama hin qabu.
I shouldn’t have said that	Silaa waan sana dubbachuu hin qabu ture
I didn't mean that.	Akkas jechuu hin barbaanne.
I do that many times in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti yeroo baayʼee akkas nan godha.
They are not needed.	Isaan hin barbaachisu.
There is no other.	Kan biraa hin jiru.
I know this is wrong.	Kun dogoggora akka ta'e nan beeka.
I should have told you this two days ago	Silaa guyyaa lama dura kana sitti himuu qaba ture
I want what you can give me	Waan ati naaf kennuu dandeessu nan barbaada
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
It looks like someone is walking.	Nama deemaa jiru fakkaata.
We don’t have any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin qabnu.
I know what you want	Waan ati barbaaddu nan beeka
I thought you would like the joke	Qoosaa sana ni jaallattu jedheen yaade
Slightly wider, surround sound	Xiqqoo bal’aa, sagalee naannoo
I have a problem though.	Rakkoon qaba garuu.
It is very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
Something like that happens.	Wanti akkasii ni ta'a.
His, hers and the truth.	Kan isaa, kan ishee fi dhugaa.
He would have had a daughter, you know	Silaa intala qaba ture, beekta
No one seemed to know where he was.	Eessa akka jiru namni beeku hin fakkaatu ture.
I want to work part time	Yeroo muraasaaf hojjechuu barbaada
It’s just nice with everything.	Waan hundumaa wajjin qofa namatti tola.
I'm trying to help you.	Si gargaaruuf yaalaa jira.
If not, they should go home again.	Yoo hin taane ammas gara manaatti deebi'uu qabu.
Not who did it.	Eenyu akka godhe miti.
I don't want to do that.	Ani akkas gochuu hin barbaadu.
I didn’t know enough.	Ani gahaa hin beeku ture.
They need our money.	Maallaqa keenya isaan barbaachisa.
I don’t understand how it doesn’t work.	Akkamitti akka hin hojjenne naaf hin galle.
It was a different place.	Bakka adda ta'e ture.
I know they need to be home	Mana ta'uu akka qaban nan beeka
That's almost true.	Sun dhugaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
I think you will like her.	Ishee ni jaallattu jedheen yaada.
He had nothing new to say	Waan haaraa jedhu hin qabu ture
He didn't think about work.	Waa'ee hojii hin yaadne.
You can help me out.	Na gargaaruu dandeessu.
They say this is just too good to be true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii qofa jedhu.
It's going to me.	Gara kootti deema.
I wish it was me	Osoo ana ta'ee natti tola
I don’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku.
It was someone in him, he thought.	Nama isa keessa jiru ture jedhee yaade.
I could eat it later	Booda nyaachuu nan danda'a ture
The whole truth.	Dhugaa guutuu.
I'm at home.	Ani mana jira.
It was really good for a while	Dhuguma yeroo muraasaaf gaarii ture
I didn’t know them	Ani isaan hin beekne
I wasn’t interested in doing anything	Homaa hojjechuuf fedhii hin qabu ture
I couldn't find it.	Argachuu hin dandeenye.
I hadn’t seen her yet	Hanga ammaatti ishee hin argine ture
It didn’t seem so great at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas guddaa hin fakkaatu ture.
Maybe it will never be time.	Tarii yeroon isaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ta'a.
I didn’t know anything	Ani homaa hin beeku ture
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
But I know it's an important question	Gaaffii barbaachisaa ta'uu isaa garuu nan beeka
I couldn’t find anything.	Homaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I knew something was seriously wrong	Wanti tokko dogoggora guddaa akka qabu nan beeka ture
On the working.	Hojjechuu irratti.
I don't want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaadu.
It was great.	Guddaa ture.
Again, he was the only guy in the room.	Ammas, kutaa sana keessatti gurbaa isa qofa ture.
Now I did it.	Amma nan godhe.
I think we should speak up	Dubbachuu qabna jedheen yaada
I probably never will be	Ani tarii gonkumaa hin ta'u
She just did what she could do.	Waan isheen gochuu dandeessu qofa goote.
I don't want anything else	Kan biraa hin barbaadu
Something that is necessary.	Waan nama barbaachisu.
It’s on my way.	Karaa koo irra jira.
I knew why, of course	Maaliif akka taʼe nan beeka ture, beekamaadha
I saw them.	Isaan arge.
Maybe it was true.	Tarii dhugaa ture ta'a.
It has never been more true than today.	Har'a caalaa dhugaa ta'ee hin beeku.
It became really important.	Dhuguma barbaachisaa ta'e.
This was here, now.	Kun as ture, amma.
I have this.	Ani kana qaba.
Tell me what he means.	Jechuun isaa natti himi.
He doesn’t need this now.	Amma kana isa hin barbaachisu.
I think about it every day and night.	Halkan fi guyyaa hunda itti yaada.
He has no problems.	Inni rakkoo hin qabu.
It doesn't seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu.
She had questions to ask.	Gaaffii gaafachuu qabdu qabdi turte.
That was pretty bad.	Sun baayyee hamaa ture.
That doesn’t mean there wasn’t one, though.	Tokko hin turre jechuu miti garuu.
Not a bad place.	Bakka hamaa miti.
As it can be.	Akkuma ta'uu danda'u.
I didn’t really know them that well	Dhuguma akkasitti isaan hin beeku ture
It's going to be a disaster.	Balaa ta'uuf deema.
I want to be your wife	Haadha manaa kee ta'uu nan barbaada
Sorry, but there is.	Dhiifama garuu ni jira.
Nothing else to do.	Waan biraa hojjechuu hin qabne.
People want you.	Namoonni si barbaadu.
He could still come back.	Ammas deebi'uu danda'a ture.
This should be easy.	Kun salphaa ta'uu qaba.
Who knows.	Eenyutu beeka.
I would never have thought of it	Silaa gonkumaa hin yaadu ture
There is no such thing here.	Asitti wanti akkasii hin jiru.
I know we were bad	Hamaa akka turre nan beeka
It’s really something.	Dhuguma waan tokko.
Most people have nothing.	Namoonni baay'een homaa hin qaban.
A great man, a good man	Nama guddaa, nama gaarii
Everything else she needs to know.	Waan biraa isheen beekuu qabdu hunda.
Everything goes smoothly.	Wanti hundi sirriitti deema.
It gave me a chance to help you.	Carraa si gargaaruuf naaf kenne.
If it were that simple, everyone could be doing it.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee namni hundi hojjechaa jiraachuu danda'a.
It’s just that it was a very long time ago.	Baayyee dheeraa dura ture jechuu qofa.
Didn't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beekne.
I don’t know how to work well with people.	Namoota waliin akka gaariitti hojjechuu hin beeku.
I didn’t do anything to you	Ani homaa si hin goone
They loved it.	Isaan ni jaallatu turan.
I wondered who would want to buy it.	Eenyutu bitachuu barbaada jedheen yaade.
Now, he was more.	Amma, inni caalaa ture.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
You know you can’t.	Akka hin dandeenye beekta.
Look at that picture.	Suuraa sana ilaalaa.
He didn't do this.	Kana hin goone.
I've never been like that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
I know what he means.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade nan beeka.
No one said anything.	Namni homaa dubbate hin jiru.
But it does work.	Garuu ni hojjeta.
I can't do anything about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa gochuu hin danda'u
That was something they all had in common.	Sun waan hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu ture.
That still seems a bit unrealistic.	Sun ammallee xiqqoo waan dhugaa hin taane fakkaata.
But that’s irrelevant right now.	Garuu sun yeroo ammaa kana barbaachisaa miti.
There is nothing any of us can do to help you.	Wanti nu keessaa tokkollee si gargaaruu danda'u hin jiru.
No one is around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin jiru.
I still think it’s right	Ammallee sirrii natti fakkaata
I could have gone home	Silaa gara manaatti deebi'uu nan danda'a ture
We were trying our best.	Nuti waan dandeenyu hunda yaalaa turre.
I can always see the truth in everything	Yeroo hundumaa waan hundumaa keessatti dhugaa arguu nan danda'a
But I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e garuu hin beeku.
I told him my thoughts once	Yaada koo yeroo tokko itti hime
Without you	Si malee .
But not here.	Asitti garuu miti.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin qabu ture.
They had to find the little girl.	Intala xiqqoo sana argachuu qabu turan.
I wouldn’t just be waiting around	Silaa naannoo qofa eegaa hin jiru ture
I know it can't be me	Ana ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
He looked at his house more than he did.	Isa caalaa mana isaa ilaale.
People want a lot of things.	Namoonni waan hedduu barbaadu.
I don't have to say that	Ani akkas jechuu hin qabu
I knew what it was like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture
I could tell him everything	Waan hundumaa itti himuu nan dandaʼa ture
I couldn't have said it.	Silaa jechuu hin danda'u ture.
But I know what happened	Waan ta'e garuu nan beeka
Maybe it shouldn't have been.	Tarii akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I have no problem with your little question	Gaaffii xiqqoo keessan kanaan rakkoo hin qabu
Someone is waiting.	Namni tokko eegaa jira.
Everything important was in place.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta’e hundi bakka isaa ture.
This is life	Kun jireenya .
I don't have a reason.	Ani sababa hin qabu.
I mean, it was early	Dafee ture jechuu kooti
She just didn't last very long.	Isheen baay'ee hin turre qofa.
He can be very optimistic about this.	Kana keessatti abdii guddaa qabaachuu dandaʼa.
Now, in my house.	Amma, mana koo keessatti.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Inni nama akkasii hin turre.
Can't get any higher than that	Kana caalaa ol argachuu hin danda'u
Now we are here again.	Amma ammas as jirra.
I can't play anymore.	Kana booda taphachuu hin danda'u.
I didn't know him	Ani isa hin beekne
In this way they were one.	Haala kanaan isaan tokko turan.
So he had no real answer	Kanaaf deebii dhugaa hin qabu ture
When this happens, two things can happen.	Yeroo kun ta’u wanti lama ta’uu danda’a.
Love your name.	Maqaa kee jaalladhu.
That obviously doesn’t work.	Sun akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
This is a long way to go.	Kun karaa dheeraa dha.
He never could.	Gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
I didn't really see it being an issue	Dhuguma dhimma ta'uu isaa hin argine
I was never a parent.	Ani gonkumaa warra hin turre.
We are in the truth.	Nuti dhugaa keessa jirra.
That's the most important thing about this.	Wanti kana keessaa wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma.
I can help with that.	Sana irratti gargaaruu nan danda'a.
I'm just not sure.	Ani garuu mirkanaa'aa miti.
You know you can do the job.	Hojii sana hojjechuu akka dandeessu beekta.
I’m really happy for you, when you need me	Dhuguma sitti gammadeera, yeroo ati na barbaaddu
All very old school.	Hundi isaanii mana barumsaa baayyee durii.
I thought it didn’t matter	Homaa hin qabu jedheen yaade
I really should let it happen	Dhuguma akka ta'u dhiisuu qaba
I'm just without anyone.	Ani nama tokko malee qofa.
It would have been an idea.	Silaa yaada ture.
Now you need those things.	Amma wantoota sana si barbaachisa.
This is something new.	Kun waan haaraa dha.
It didn’t do very well.	Baayyee gaarii hin hojjenne.
Now he is doing so.	Amma akkas gochaa jira.
She'll be fine.	Isheen gaarii ta'a.
I thought maybe never	Tarii gonkumaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a jedheen yaade
It eats him up.	Isa nyaata.
I wanted to ask that question.	Gaaffii sana gaafachuu barbaade.
There is nothing like the old days.	Waan akka durii hin jiru.
Obviously somewhere else.	Bakka biraa akka ta'e ifaadha.
A couple of days, maybe more	Guyyaa lama lama, tarii kana caalaa
There is no reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni hin jiru.
You can help.	Gargaaruu dandeessa.
Easy money, he told himself.	Maallaqa salphaa jedhee ofitti hime.
It’s not like that.	Akkasitti miti.
I didn’t want that to happen in my book	Kitaaba koo irratti akkas akka ta’u hin barbaanne
That wasn’t good enough.	Sun gaarii hin turre.
Why would anyone want to go somewhere else.	Namni maaliif bakka biraa deemuu barbaada.
Maybe he doesn't know what he's doing.	Tarii waan hojjetu hin beeku ta'a.
That's for sure.	Kana mirkanaa'aa dha.
Such a good man.	Nama gaarii akkasii.
It wasn't going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin turre.
They were there, right there.	Isaan achi turan, sirriitti achi turan.
No one should live like that.	Namni akkas jiraachuu hin qabu.
I know what we have is real	Wanti nuti qabnu dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan beeka
He might well have believed it.	Inni akka gaariitti amanuu dandaʼa ture.
I think there’s a bit there.	Achitti xiqqoo waan jiru natti fakkaata.
I can't live without you	Si malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
So far.	Hanga ammaatti.
That was extremely dangerous.	Sun garmalee balaa qaba ture.
He wouldn’t do it.	Inni hin godhu ture.
It was my mistake.	Dogoggora koo ture.
I don’t want to be here without you	Osoo ati hin taane as jiraachuu hin barbaadu
They know when you’re there.	Yeroo ati achi jirtu ni beeku.
I didn't think much of this	Kana baay'ee hin yaadne
Few people.	Namoonni muraasa.
But this is clearly not the case.	Garuu kun akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
You were not a good little girl.	Ati intala xiqqoo gaarii hin turre.
Two of us, now.	Lama keenya, amma.
I can't tell you any more	Kana caalaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
What came with it came with it.	Kan waliin dhufe waliin dhufe.
But they didn’t think so.	Garuu akkas hin yaadne turan.
To be really special.	Dhuguma adda ta'uuf.
What more could there be.	Kana caalaa maaltu jira ture.
Such as.	Kan akka.
But not this time.	Garuu yeroo kana miti.
Good luck next year.	Bara dhufu carraa gaarii.
There is no other way to do this.	Kana karaa biraa hin jiru.
I mean, of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha jechuu kooti.
I don’t know exactly where she is.	Bakka isheen jirtu sirriitti hin beeku.
You’re doing it, you’re doing good.	Ati hojjechaa jirta, waan gaarii hojjechaa jirta.
He shouldn't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
When.	Yoom.
It was a simple accident.	Balaa salphaa ture.
I didn't want to know anything about them	Waa'ee isaanii homaa beekuu hin barbaanne
I think this is very important	Kana baayyee barbaachisaa jedheen yaada
You will know in a moment.	Yeroo muraasa booda ni beektu.
It’s not one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko miti.
I know this place very well	Bakka kana baay'een beeka
I just wasn’t that into it	Ani hanga sana keessa hin turre qofa
Just like in the old days.	Akkuma bara durii.
I didn't know it was you	Si ta'uu hin beeku ture
Not sure why though.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti garuu.
It came out after only about three months	Gara ji'a sadii qofa booda ba'e
I need someone with a real job	Nama hojii dhugaa qabu na barbaachisa
His work is good.	Hojiin isaa gaarii dha.
But we saw enough.	Garuu gahaa argine.
They don’t matter here.	Asitti isaan dhimma hin qaban.
They are there.	Isaan achi jiru.
I know we haven’t known each other for a long time	Yeroo dheeraa akka wal hin beekne nan beeka
It’s not a human being.	Nama miti.
It was what he meant.	Waan inni jechuu barbaade ture.
It happened, but not very often.	Ni ta'e, garuu yeroo baay'ee miti.
I knew the place.	Bakka sana nan beeka ture.
I can't tell you why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sitti himuu hin danda'u.
It looks really good.	Dhuguma gaarii fakkaata.
Someone may not even have one.	Namni tokko tokkollee qabaachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
It was so very possible.	Akkas baay'ee ni danda'ama ture.
I just can't help myself	Of gargaaruu qofa hin danda'u
You still can’t get that.	Ammas sana argachuu hin dandeessu.
He is the only one who can do it today.	Har'a kan gochuu danda'u isa qofa.
Just like he did.	Akkuma inni godhe.
I hope I am often	Yeroo baayyee akkan jiru abdiin qaba
Everything else looks fine.	Wanti biraa hundi gaarii fakkaata.
It doesn’t matter what you’re doing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti maal hojjechaa akka jirtu homaa hin qabu.
I told him it was just a joke	Qoosaa qofa akka ta'e itti hime
Just a mother.	Haadha qofa.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I didn’t really think that would have been possible	Silaa akkas ni danda’ama jedhee baay’ee hin yaadu ture
It was a huge mistake	Dogoggora guddaa ture
But there is no such thing.	Garuu wanti akkasii hin jiru.
I think you're right	Ati sirrii natti fakkaata
He went away again.	Ammas deeme.
I can tell you something.	Waan tokko sitti himuu danda'a.
But you know.	Garuu beekta.
It was a disaster, really.	Balaa ture, dhuguma.
I know you know feelings.	Miira akka beektu nan beeka.
He’s been here before.	Inni kanaan dura as ture.
I think they should be this morning	Har'a ganama ta'uu qabu jedheen yaada
He has to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qaba.
I know you love it.	Akka jaallattu nan beeka.
It doesn't exist yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin jiru.
It really needs to work harder.	Dhuguma caalaatti hojjechuu qaba.
I think she knows that	Isheen kana waan beektu natti fakkaata
It was all wrong.	Hundi isaa dogoggora ture.
I want to be inside of her so badly	Akka malee keessa ishee ta'uu barbaada
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I can't tell you the truth.	Dhugaa sitti himuu hin danda'u.
I don’t have to speak for him.	Isaaf dubbachuu hin qabu.
I couldn’t do that now.	Amma akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
But it was just that one.	Garuu tokko sana qofa ture.
He couldn’t do that.	Inni akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
If you don’t, you won’t.	Yoo hin goone hin gootu.
You could say he was larger than life.	Inni jireenya caalaa guddaa ture jechuu dandeessa.
There was a time.	Yeroon tokko ture.
It’s so obvious now.	Amma akka malee ifaadha.
I could ask her a lot of things	Waan baay'ee ishee gaafachuu nan danda'a ture
It would be easier.	Salphaa ta'a ture.
I knew she still loved me	Ammallee akka na jaallattu nan beeka ture
You know, probably not.	Beektaa, tarii hin ta'u.
I know better.	Ani caalaatti beeka.
But it seems necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa fakkaata.
I can't be who you want me to be	Ani eenyu akkan ta'u barbaaddu ta'uu hin danda'u
That’s how I think of her.	Akkasitti ishee yaada.
That's nothing.	Sun homaa miti.
I then commented on it	Anis kana booda yaada itti kenne
She hadn’t noticed yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin hubanne turte.
This is fascinating.	Kun namatti tola.
I couldn’t make myself say more	Kana caalaa akkan jedhu of gochuu hin dandeenye
He must live a life.	Jireenya jiraachuu qaba.
She was a human being.	Isheen nama turte.
Two hours later.	Sa'aatii lama booda.
I doubt it will be long	Yeroo dheeraa akka ta'u nan shakka
Not her mother.	Haadha ishee miti.
No more of that stuff.	Kana booda waan sana hin jiru.
This was one of those moments.	Yeroon kun yeroo sana keessaa tokko ture.
That’s how I go with him.	Akkasitti isa waliin deema.
You have to do this.	Kana gochuu qabda.
Now none of that matters.	Amma sun tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
I don't think so.	Ani akkas hin fakkaatu.
This took real work.	Kun hojii dhugaa fudhate.
She had a great voice for such a young girl.	Intala xiqqoo akkasii kanaaf sagalee guddaa qabdi turte.
Ever found out what that was.	Yoom iyyuu sun maal akka ta'e argate.
I couldn’t do anything to her	Homaa ishee gochuu hin dandeenye
Like a dog.	Akka saree.
I wondered where the problem was	Rakkoon sun eessa jira jedheen yaade
I want to know if it works.	Hojjechuu isaa beekuu barbaada.
Not like in the old days.	Akka bara durii miti.
I looked him right in the eye	Anis sirriitti ija isaa keessa isa ilaale
They say it's okay.	Rakkoo hin qabu jedhu.
I don't have time for that	Kanaaf yeroo hin qabu
I would have been alone, completely alone	Silaa kophaa koo, guutummaatti kophaa koo ture
I can be what you want me to be	Ani waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu nan danda'a
He had no answer	Deebii hin qabu ture
Only for a moment though.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa garuu.
I just need your help	Gargaarsa keessan qofa na barbaachisa
It was a lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa ture.
I wanted to do this for you	Kana siif gochuu barbaade
If it's not too bad.	Yoo baayyee hamaa hin taane.
Didn't see him much	Baay'ee isa hin argine
But that wasn’t true.	Garuu sun dhugaa hin turre.
I mean, people love me.	Namoonni na jaallatu jechuu kooti.
It wasn’t like him.	Akka isaa hin turre.
They were in their new home.	Mana isaanii haaraa keessa turan.
I didn’t want to come here	Ani as dhufuu hin barbaanne
I couldn't find it.	Argachuu hin dandeenye.
But none had worked.	Garuu tokkollee hin hojjenne ture.
I doubt he needs much help	Gargaarsa guddaa akka isa barbaachisu nan shakka
I am curious to know	Ani beekuu barbaadaa jira
I didn’t know why she wanted to see it	Maaliif arguu akka barbaaddu hin beeku ture
That meant working on people.	Kana jechuun namoota irratti hojjechuu ture.
I wanted to go with my friends	Hiriyyoota koo wajjin deemuun barbaade
Someone found this passage important.	Namni tokko kutaa kana barbaachisaa ta’ee argate.
No one wanted it.	Namni barbaade hin jiru.
I knew she had it	Akka isheen qabdu nan beeka ture
But it may not be enough.	Garuu gahaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Maybe a little bit.	Tarii xiqqoo xiqqoo ta'uu danda'a.
He wouldn't, you know.	Hin godhu ture, beekta.
He should have stayed on	Silaa irra turuu qaba ture
It was all going well.	Hundi isaa akka gaariitti deemaa ture.
It was true enough.	Dhugaa gahaa ture.
I thought he had gone a long time ago	Yeroo dheeraa dura waan deeme natti fakkaate
Really, that’s it.	Dhuguma, kanuma.
Year in, year out.	Waggaa keessa, waggaa ba'e.
This is just not true.	Kun dhugaa miti qofa.
Look for those things.	Wantoota sana barbaadaa.
Glad to see her	Ishee arguu kootti gammadeera
I couldn’t get any answers	Deebii tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
I have plenty of time to help you	Yeroon isin gargaaruuf baay'ee qaba
I would never have known.	Silaa gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
He has no reason to help him	Sababni isa gargaaru hin qabu
He really did like the guy	Dhuguma akka gurbaa sanaa godhe
You have the facts.	Dhugaa jiru qabda.
It didn’t matter what went on before.	Kanaan dura maaltu akka deeme homaa hin turre.
I want to be a father.	Ani abbaa ta'uu barbaada.
It was the same every night.	Halkan hunda kanuma ture.
This happens to some children.	Kun ijoollee tokko tokko irratti ni ta’a.
They wanted to know why.	Maaliif akka taʼe beekuu barbaadu turan.
He said my name.	Maqaa koo jedhe.
We had a great time and lots of jokes together.	Yeroo guddaa fi qoosaa hedduu waliin hojjechuu qabna turre.
A clear clear feeling.	Miira ifa ta’e ifa ta’e.
But sometimes, it can be too soon.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko, dafee ta'uu danda'a.
That doesn’t help anyone.	Sun nama hin gargaaru.
It will always be yours	Yoomiyyuu kan kee ta'a
They should help more.	Caalaatti gargaaruu qabu.
I still can't see that	Ammas sana arguu hin danda'u
It seemed longer than that.	Kana caalaa dheeraa fakkaata ture.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta yeroo tokko tokko hin hojjetu.
What is.	Maali.
Glad to have him here now	Amma asitti isa argachuu kootti gammadeera
You have a chance to be different.	Carraa adda ta'uu qabda.
I think that’s what you want	Akka ati barbaaddu natti fakkaata
I’m going to do the same thing	Anis kanuma hojjechuuf deema
Great for a day stay inside.	Guyyaa tokko keessa turuuf baayyee gaarii dha.
That’s how it would work.	Silaa akkasitti hojjeta ture.
He was trying to help	Gargaaruuf yaalaa ture
I always wanted someone to love me	Yeroo hundumaa namni tokko akka na jaallatu nan barbaada ture
I mean, look at you.	Si ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
It came with nothing	Homaa tokko malee dhufe
It wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa hin turre.
It should work both ways.	Karaa lamaan hojjechuu qaba.
Like a guy.	Akka gurbaa.
Sometimes it happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni ta'a.
They didn’t belong there.	Isaan kan achi hin turre.
He wanted to find her.	Ishee argachuu barbaade.
That you should never do the same thing twice.	Gonkumaa yeroo lama waan tokko gochuu akka hin qabne.
I haven’t seen her yet	Hanga ammaatti ishee hin argine
Now I saw it.	Amma arge.
Which is unnecessary.	Kan hin barbaachifne.
I still have no idea where he went	Ammallee eessa akka deeme yaada hin qabu
This was more like him.	Kun caalaatti isa fakkaata ture.
I want to know more about you	Waa'ee kee caalaatti beekuu barbaada
We only saw her once.	Yeroo tokko qofa ishee argine.
I always suspected that	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedheen shakka ture
I thought they were there the whole time	Yeroo sana guutuu achi turan jedheen yaade
I have no feelings for him	Miira isaaf hin qabu
It was just when.	Yoom qofa ture.
I am not alone in that thought	Yaada sana keessa kophaa koo miti
I mean here.	Asitti jechuu kooti.
But that wasn’t so bad.	Garuu sun hangas hamaa hin turre.
No big feelings, just that simple fact.	Miira guddaa hin qabu, dhugaa salphaa sana qofa.
Just a big mistake, really.	Dogoggora guddaa qofa, dhuguma.
Maybe he didn't see her.	Tarii ishee hin argine ta'a.
Clearly, this is a problem.	Kun rakkoo akka ta’e ifaadha.
But it wouldn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu ture.
You have something more important to do today.	Har'a waan kana caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e hojjechuu qabda.
Hope everyone feels a little better.	Namni hundi xiqqoo miira gaarii akka qabu abdii qabna.
This is not necessary.	Kun barbaachisaa miti.
This is never easy.	Kun gonkumaa salphaa miti.
They can come after someone else and someone else and someone else.	Nama biraa fi nama biraa fi nama biraa booda dhufuu danda'u.
If he enjoys it.	Yoo itti gammade.
It was always in there	Yeroo hundumaa achi keessa ture
He was everything.	Inni hunda ture.
I just don’t have any interest.	Fedhii tokkollee hin qabu qofa.
I wanted to say all this but I couldn’t	Waan kana hunda dubbachuu barbaade garuu hin dandeenye
It does the right thing for you.	Waan sirrii siif hojjeta.
I still wonder why they haven’t done that	Ammallee maaliif akkas hin goone jedheen yaada
It was very simple.	Baayyee salphaa ture.
I was going somewhere with my mother	Haadha koo waliin bakka tokko deemaa ture
As you should be.	Akkuma ta'uu qabdu.
I don't know if it is.	Ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
But, hopefully it will come soon.	Garuu, yeroo dhiyootti akka dhufu abdii qabna.
She had this.	Kana qabdi turte.
I'm sure of that.	Sana mirkanaa'aa dha.
You don’t seem to be.	Hin fakkaattu.
It’s got to be right.	Sirrii ta’uu qaba.
Then a week later.	Sana booda torban tokko.
But that’s how it seems to work.	Garuu akkasitti waan hojjetu fakkaata.
It was going to be our day	Guyyaa keenya ta'uuf ture
They will do their job.	Hojii isaanii ni hojjetu.
It’s not just about money.	Maallaqa qofa miti.
It’s in my father’s name.	Maqaa abbaa koo irra jira.
He wanted to be alone	Kophaa ta'uu barbaade
My father, but not my father.	Abbaa koo, garuu abbaa koo miti.
I still can't go home though	Ammallee gara manaatti deebi'uu hin danda'u garuu
Now I have three.	Amma sadii qaba.
Not much, but some.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane tokko tokko.
He’s known me for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf na beeka.
You’re just playing.	Ati taphachuu qofa.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
When there is.	Yeroo jiru.
I never would have been able to.	Silaa gonkumaa hin danda'u ture.
He only did that a couple of times.	Yeroo lama lama qofa akkas godhe.
Something like that.	Waan akkasii.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
I didn't want to make a big deal about it	Waa'ee kanaa waan guddaa gochuu hin barbaanne
Unless you don't want kids.	Ijoollee hin barbaanne yoo ta'e malee.
I really didn’t think he was here	Dhuguma waan inni as jiru natti hin fakkaatu ture
I think they will help us	Nu gargaaru jedheen yaada
It became a complete nothing.	Guutummaatti waan hin qabne ta’e.
This looks pretty good.	Kun baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
So we can’t live there.	Kanaaf achi jiraachuu hin dandeenyu.
It was his mother.	Haadha isaa ture.
But he couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye.
I thought we should go	Deemuu qabna jedheen yaade
This could all be true.	Kun hundi dhugaa ta'uu danda'a.
I wouldn't be sure about that	Waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa hin ta'u ture
Sometimes, that happens.	Yeroo tokko tokko, akkas ta'a.
One hope was all that happened	Abdiin tokko waan ta'e qofa ture
I think we all agree that this person is you	Namni kun si ta'uu keenya hundi keenya irratti walii galle natti fakkaata
She wasn’t that much.	Isheen hanga sanaa hin turre.
I don’t know what to think myself	Ofii koo maal akkan yaadu hin beeku
I'm so glad I found you.	Si argachuu kootti baay'een gammade.
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
That’s just money.	Sun maallaqa qofa.
It’s not just me.	Ana qofa miti.
He wasn’t always great	Yeroo hundumaa nama guddaa hin turre
Someone noticed a dog in the car.	Namni tokko konkolaataa keessa saree tokko hubate.
He’s just too good.	Inni garmalee gaarii qofa.
If so, you must tell me.	Yoo akkas ta'e natti himuu qabda.
He looked at the moment.	Yeroo sana ilaale.
I just couldn’t find that one answer	Ani garuu deebii tokko sana argachuu hin dandeenye
Just living alone.	Jiraachuu kophaa qofa.
If only things were different.	Osoo wanti adda ta'ee.
But it was so bad.	Garuu akkas hamaa ture.
No one was looking for him.	Namni isa barbaadu hin turre.
Tell me about it.	Waa'ee isaa natti himi.
Before long, something was looking up.	Yeroo muraasa booda wanti tokko ol ilaalaa ture.
One cannot be at a disadvantage in these things	Namni tokko wantoota kana keessatti haala hamaa keessa jiraachuu hin danda’u
No one thought of it.	Namni yaade hin jiru.
It won't be much help	Gargaarsa guddaa hin ta'u
They were up there.	Isaan achi ol turan.
It didn’t matter at the time	Yeroo sanatti dhimma hin qabu ture
I didn’t tell anyone, except you	Namatti hin himne, si malee
I can't do that to him	Ani akkas isa gochuu hin danda'u
I wouldn’t say noise at all	Ani tasumaa sagalee hin jedhu ture
They never were.	Isaan gonkumaa hin turre.
I mean really into you	Dhuguma si keessa jechuu kooti
I shouldn’t have had it.	Ani qabaachuu hin qabu ture.
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii dha.
Then you have a chance.	Sana booda carraa qabda.
Just like him.	Akkuma isaa.
This is not your house.	Kun mana keessan miti.
It obviously doesn’t work.	Akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
You are on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra jirta.
Maybe it will happen.	Tarii ni ta'a.
A really long time ago	Dhuguma yeroo dheeraa dura
But he wants to ask her.	Inni garuu ishee gaafachuu barbaada.
More than you.	Si caalaa.
No one would have seen anything.	Silaa namni homaa arge hin jiru.
I don't mean anything	Homaa jechuu koo miti
It was once mine.	Yeroo tokko kan koo ture.
He looked at his picture again	Ammas suuraa isaa ilaale
Those are the parents.	Isaan sun warra.
They just have to come back.	Deebi'uu qofa qabu.
But she didn't know.	Isheen garuu hin beektu turte.
It's just the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii ta'e qofa.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
He had a question	Gaaffii qaba ture
None of it was needed.	Tokkollee hin barbaachifne.
I want to be a teacher.	Barsiisaa ta'uu barbaada.
He must know what is happening	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba
That's what I've said.	Akkas jedheen jira.
So now you know.	Kanaaf amma beekta.
Maybe it doesn't matter.	Tarii homaa hin ta'u.
There was no one on the road.	Karaa irra namni hin turre.
I didn't think it would be like that	Akkas ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
That's going to be true.	Sun dhugaa ta'uuf deema.
The sound above everything else	Sagalee waan biraa hunda irra jiru
The same is true of light.	Ifa illee kanuma.
I couldn’t even speak their language	Afaan isaanii illee dubbachuu hin dandeenye
I know you were just here to be with me	Na waliin ta'uuf qofa akka as turte nan beeka
It was a mistake for me to do this.	Kana gochuun koo dogoggora ture.
What no one really knew was why he did it.	Wanti namni dhuguma hin beekne maaliif akka godhe ture.
I didn’t do anything	Ani homaa hin hojjenne
It all seemed too good to be true	Hundi isaa dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii fakkaata ture
I don't think so.	Ani na hin fakkaatu.
This is our problem.	Kun rakkoo keenya.
He gave me a mouth.	Afaan naaf kenne.
I won’t do it anymore.	Kana booda hin godhu.
I can only talk about them.	Waa'ee isaanii qofa dubbachuu danda'a.
I knew he was happy	Akka gammade nan beeka ture
She holds my hand.	Harka koo qabdi.
I think that was a mistake	Sun dogoggora ture jedheen yaada
I just have an idea about it	Waa'ee yaada qofa qaba
Just not right now.	Yeroo ammaa miti qofa.
I knew he would love it.	Akka inni jaallatu nan beeka ture.
But it wasn't too bad.	Garuu baayyee hamaa hin turre.
They can do a few of them.	Isaan keessaa muraasa gochuu dandaʼu.
I still couldn't believe it happened	Ammallee akka ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
You had to do this.	Kana gochuu qabdu turte.
It was a great job.	Hojii guddaa ture.
I know him a little bit.	Xiqqoo isa beeka.
That's pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii dha.
I just need his luck.	Carraa isaa qofa na barbaachisa.
You have the money.	Maallaqa qabda.
I don’t want answers but I need to know the truth.	Deebii hin barbaadu garuu dhugaa beekuu qaba.
What did he do.	Maal godhe.
There just wasn’t any.	Tokkollee hin turre qofa.
She said this, he said that.	Isheen kana jette, inni akkas jedhe.
They absolutely love it.	Isaan guutummaatti ni jaallatu.
I think it looks good	Gaarii fakkaata jedheen yaada
The thing is nothing.	Wanti homaa miti.
But, as it was, we understood.	Garuu, akkuma ture, nuti hubanne.
They had done nothing to him.	Isaan homaa isa hin goone turan.
He makes us drinks.	Dhugaatii nuuf godha.
On a clear night.	Halkan ifa ta'e irratti.
I saw some people there	Namoota tokko tokko achitti arge
I know it's something	Waan tokko akka ta'e nan beeka
He quickly looked at my other eye	Dafee ija biraa koo ilaale
I think they are right	Isaan sirrii natti fakkaata
So far, nothing has been serious.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hamaa hin turre.
I will say the job was easy	Hojiin sun salphaa ture nan jedha
we cannot have it.	qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
I hadn’t thought about it	Ani itti hin yaadne ture
Look at me.	Na ilaalaa.
I don't know how this is happening.	Kun akkamitti akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
I want to be my other self	Ani ofii koo isa biraa ta'uu barbaada
But I know this.	Kana garuu nan beeka.
I am in very good shape	Ani haala baayyee gaarii irra jira
There's not much you can do about it.	Wanti baay'ee ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
But it was too much.	Garuu garmalee ture.
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
He was the only one who did.	Kan kana godhe isa qofa ture.
I can't believe she does that every night	Halkan hunda akkas akka gootu amanuu hin danda'u
Wife and children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee.
I knew he would	Akka inni godhu nan beeka ture
I really enjoyed that episode	Kutaa sana baay'een gammade
We spoke twice.	Yeroo lama dubbanne.
It’s just so great.	Akka malee guddaa qofa.
I went with him to go with him	Isa waliin deemuuf isa waliin deeme
I knew what had happened	Waan taʼe nan beeka ture
You're doing a lot for me here.	Asitti waan baay'ee naaf hojjechaa jirta.
It’s in him.	Isa keessa jira.
I didn’t know what you were thinking	Waan ati yaaddu hin beeku ture
I thought I was already here	Duraan as jira jedheen yaade
I have to go to them	Gara isaanii deemuun qaba
But it really wasn’t like that.	Garuu dhuguma akkas hin turre.
My night was so great.	Halkan koo akkas guddaa ture.
Sometimes she wouldn’t.	Yeroo tokko tokko hin gootu turte.
You are not in every thought.	Yaada hunda keessa hin jirtu.
There must be something else going on there.	Wanti biraa achitti deemaa jiru jiraachuu qaba.
He didn’t want to.	Inni hin barbaanne.
She was holding me.	Isheen na qabdi turte.
He didn’t have all the facts	Dhugaa jiru hunda hin qabu ture
You are so much more than that.	Ati baay'ee kana caalaa jirta.
You care about me.	Ati naaf yaaddu.
He thought about tonight	Waa'ee halkan kanaa yaade
Not so much anymore.	Kana booda hangas miti.
I won't tell him anything	Ani homaa itti hin himu
He wants to believe.	Amanuu barbaada.
I have to do this for me	Kana naaf gochuun qaba
I think someone did something to her.	Namni tokko waan tokko ishee godhe natti fakkaata.
One of us has to go	Tokko keenya deemuu qaba
This must be the case.	Kun ta'uu qaba.
Two gave.	Lama kenne.
He should have done better	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu qaba ture
Now, that must be true.	Amma, sun dhugaa ta’uu qaba.
Not that it was a good thing.	Waan gaarii ture jechuu miti.
I wasn’t going to leave	Ani deemuuf hin turre
I know what happens there	Waan achitti ta'u nan beeka
She would have had nothing.	Silaa homaa hin qabdu ture.
She was really on tonight.	Dhuguma halkan kana irra turte.
That's what should happen.	Kan ta'uu qabu kanuma.
I wish it was me instead of you	Silaa bakka siif ta'ee ana ta'ee natti tola
I want you more than you know	Caalaa ati beektu caalaa si barbaada
Can't see past that night	Halkan sana darbe arguu hin danda'u
That was my mother.	Sun haadha koo turte.
It does a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjeta.
I wondered what they would do now	Amma maal godhu jedheen yaade
That was on her.	Sana ishee irra ture.
They just need to work with us.	Nu waliin hojjechuu qofa isaan barbaachisa.
It would be a problem I didn't need their name	Rakkoo maqaa isaanii na hin barbaachifne ta'a
I hadn’t seen him there.	Achitti isa hin argine ture.
But sometimes you can.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko ni dandeessa.
It didn’t go very well.	Baayyee gaarii hin deemne.
He doesn’t have to do that alone.	Inni kophaa isaa akkas gochuu hin qabu.
She hadn't realized he was coming at her.	Isheen akka inni itti dhufu hin hubanne turte.
It’s not our job.	Hojii keenya miti.
I’m not looking her in the eye	Ani ija keessa ishee ilaalaa hin jiru
It seems he didn't.	Waan hin goone fakkaata.
I wasn't so sure now.	Amma akkasitti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
She is not my daughter.	Isheen intala koo miti.
I should have asked you a year ago	Silaa waggaa tokko dura si gaafachuu qaba ture
I can't know him at all	Ani tasumaa isa beekuu hin danda'u
I was just, you know	Ani qofa ture, beekta
But that can’t be right.	Garuu sun sirrii ta’uu hin danda’u.
I never could again.	Amma booda gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
I just don’t know what to say.	Waan jedhu qofa hin beeku.
I didn't know about it	Waa'ee kanaa hin beeku ture
This is going to be long.	Kun dheeraa ta'uuf deema.
It’s better than good.	Gaarii caalaa gaarii dha.
I quickly became a single mother	Dafee haadha kophaa jirtu ta'e
It's not as bad.	Akka hamaa miti.
But it was nothing.	Garuu homaa hin turre.
Nothing else matters.	Wanti biraa dhimma hin qabu.
There are.	Jiru.
I do hope you go home soon	Ani akkas godhu yeroo dhiyootti gara manaatti akka deemtu abdiin qaba
There really wasn't much.	Dhuguma baay'ee hin turre.
I didn't want to tell you	Sitti himuu hin barbaanne
You can make it work.	Akka hojjetu gochuu dandeessa.
I looked at her hand	Anis gara harka ishee ilaale
It was just a feeling, a bad feeling.	Miira qofa ture, miira hamaa ture.
I love it that way.	Akkasitti nan jaalladha.
I hope my career goes well	Hojiin koo akka gaariitti akka deemu abdiin qaba
Perhaps there was something he could find.	Tarii wanti inni argachuu dandaʼu jiraachuu dandaʼa.
Little do you know about me.	Waa'ee koo waan xiqqoo beektu.
I told myself there was still hope	Ammas abdiin akka jiru ofitti hime
We have almost nothing in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu waan hin qabne jechuun ni danda’ama.
He wanted everything exactly right.	Waan hundumaa sirriitti sirriitti barbaada ture.
I so you don’t know me anymore	Ani akkas kana booda na hin beekne
He knows how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e ni beeka.
I would say it was him.	Isa ture nan jedha.
I know what will happen to my clothes around here	Uffata koo naannoo as jiru maal akka ta'u nan beeka
But he couldn't speak.	Garuu dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
Not bad but not great.	Hamaa miti garuu guddaa miti.
Now that didn’t matter.	Amma sun homaa hin turre.
It is an important light.	Ifa barbaachisaa dha.
You care about us.	Ati nuuf dhimma qabda.
A special time	Yeroo adda ta'e
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
Great times	Yeroo guddaa
Then he did it.	Sana booda ni godhe.
But she still doesn't know what's wrong.	Garuu ammallee maaltu akka dogoggora ta'e hin beektu.
I have my duty.	Dirqama koo qaba.
I would be alone.	Silaa kophaa koo ta'a ture.
But she has no idea what's going on, either.	Garuu maaltu akka ta'e yaada hin qabdu, isheen illee.
I wanted to give you something	Waan tokko siif kennuu barbaade
It certainly wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I think it went pretty well	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee deeme natti fakkaata
When you were older.	Yeroo umuriin kee guddaa turte.
I know you have them	Isaan akka qabdu nan beeka
It should be easy but it's not.	Salphaa ta'uu qaba garuu akkas miti.
We are in a good position.	Haala gaarii keessa jirra.
You don’t need anything else.	Waan biraa si hin barbaachisu.
But it matters more to us.	Garuu caalaatti nuuf dhimma qaba.
I told him not to	Anis akka hin goone itti hime
I know how to handle this	Kana akkamitti akkan danda'u nan beeka
It was very bad.	Baayyee hamaa ture.
He may not find another job.	Hojii biraa argachuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I think it might be possible	Ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
It was two years ago.	Waggaa lama dura ture.
It was someone else.	Nama biraa ture.
Neither existed in real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti lamaan isaaniiyyuu hin turre.
We have many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qabna.
I had no idea what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I would never think of doing anything more	Kana caalaa waan tokko hojjechuuf gonkumaa hin yaadu ture
I should be back this afternoon	Har'a waaree booda deebi'uu qaba
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
He was probably in error	Dogoggora keessa ture ta'uu hin oolu
In a dress.	Uffata tokko keessatti.
But it would have been different.	Garuu silaa adda ta'a ture.
I should have told him a long time ago	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura itti himuu qaba ture
Everything was there.	Wanti hundi achi ture.
I couldn’t do without them.	Isaan malee hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
But he didn’t do this.	Garuu kana hin goone.
I knew it was a reason	Sababa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
I didn’t do this	Ani kana hin goone
Everything was easy.	Wanti hundi salphaa ture.
I know she wasn’t real	Isheen dhugaa akka hin turre nan beeka
Good luck in your career.	Carraa gaarii hojii keessan keessatti.
But we don’t have that anymore.	Garuu kana booda sana hin qabnu.
Hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
I mean this time	Yeroo kana jechuu kooti
He might have her.	Ishee qabaachuu danda'a.
This happened all the time.	Kun yeroo hunda ni ta'a ture.
But he certainly didn’t.	Garuu akka hin goone beekamaadha.
But she didn't.	Isheen garuu hin goone.
That was good enough.	Sun gaarii ture.
you think you’re right.	jettanii yaaddu.
There is nothing we can do for him.	Wanti nuti isaaf gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
Not even her doing so.	Akkas gochuun ishee illee miti.
But this was too much.	Garuu kun garmalee ture.
You can't.	Hin dandeessu.
I started walking on them	Isaan irra deemuu jalqabe
Assignment.	Hojii manaa.
I gave him everything	Waan hundumaa itti kenne
I just want to see more	Ani garuu kana caalaa arguu barbaada
But no one could find him there.	Garuu namni achitti isa argachuu hin dandeenye.
I knew this would happen.	Kun akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
I'm so glad you're here!.	Baay'een gammade as jirtu!.
I didn’t notice anyone around	Nama tokkollee naannoo sanatti hin hubanne
I really don’t know what to do	Dhuguma waanan godhu hin beeku
He has been an adult for a long time now.	Amma yeroo dheeraaf nama guddaa ta'ee jira.
In .	Keessa .
We can’t be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu hin dandeenyu.
Meant.	Jechuu barbaade.
Which should be like my real job.	Kan akka hojii koo isa dhugaa ta'uu qabu.
They are there right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana achi jiru.
I really don’t understand the problem.	Dhuguma rakkoon jiru naaf hin galle.
I mean, really, there is	Dhuguma, ni jira jechuu kooti
I have no idea why this is.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I can't believe what you just did for me	Waan amma naaf goote amanuu hin danda'u
Maybe it's too much.	Tarii garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
I can't say that now	Amma akkas jechuu hin danda'u
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
I wasn't so sure now.	Amma akkasitti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
This was one of his favorite places.	Kun bakka inni baay'ee jaallatu keessaa tokko ture.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
Look at what’s coming.	Waan dhufu ilaalaa.
But he saw it.	Inni garuu arge.
It was his desire.	Fedhii isaa ture.
I always wanted to know more	Yeroo hundumaa kana caalaa beekuu nan barbaada ture
I mean, no one is here	Namni as hin jiru jechuu kooti
They were no more.	Isaan kana booda hin turre.
I was not one of them.	Ani isaan keessaa tokko hin turre.
Most people don't do that.	Namoonni baay'een akkas hin godhu.
I wish it wasn't.	Osoo hin taane ta'ee natti tola.
I was on it for hours	Sa'aatii dheeraaf irra ture
He didn’t look well.	Inni akka gaariitti hin fakkaatu ture.
I never think about you	Ani gonkumaa waa'ee kee hin yaadu
Not sure it's a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I wanted to go quickly	Dafee deemuun barbaade
He said everything he could.	Waan danda'u hunda dubbateera.
You just tell me one thing.	Ati waan tokko qofa natti himi.
I couldn't have seen it coming	Silaa dhufuu isaa arguu hin danda'u ture
It started without you	Si malee jalqabe
I really hoped she would forgive me	Dhuguma dhiifama akka naaf gootu abdiin qaba ture
I have no father anymore	Kana booda abbaa hin qabu
She was just doing her job.	Hojii ishee qofa hojjechaa turte.
He should have known nothing would come of it	Silaa wanti irraa dhufu akka hin jirre beekuu qaba ture
But I didn't mean it	Ani garuu jechuu koo hin turre
I couldn't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
But I don't know.	Ani garuu hin beeku.
He knows he has to find him.	Isa argachuu akka qabu ni beeka.
Again, if it's what you want, I'll go	Ammas waan ati barbaaddu yoo ta'e nan deema
No one should say.	Namni jechuu hin qabu.
About me, this time.	Waa'ee koo, yeroo kana.
I told him a few plain truths	Dhugaa ifa taʼe muraasa itti hime
I think it should be a wider area	Naannoo bal'aa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
I think maybe it will	Tarii ni ta'a jedheen yaada
You just knew he wanted you.	Akka si barbaadu qofa beekta turte.
See what it says there.	Achitti maal akka jedhu ilaalaa.
Maybe they didn't realize it themselves.	Tarii ofii isaanii hin hubanne ta'a.
I’m looking for my daughter	Intala koo barbaadaa jira
He thought the same about us.	Waa'ee keenya kanuma yaade.
He had nothing to say	Waan jedhu hin qabu ture
A little girl without a father.	Intala xiqqoo abbaa hin qabne.
I wonder if that would be true	Sun dhugaa ta'aa jedheen yaada
I'm going to go.	Ani nan deema.
Not that anyone out there knows it's from us, of course.	Namni ala jiru nu biraa akka ta'e beeka jechuu miti, beekamaadha.
In.	Keessa.
Be in it now.	Amma keessa ta'aa.
He should have stayed with him	Silaa isa bira turuu qaba ture
But this time, she wasn’t as lucky.	Yeroo kana garuu, isheen akka carraa hin qabdu turte.
I wasn’t looking for anything like that.	Waan akkasii barbaadaa hin turre.
I can get you that help	Gargaarsa sana siif argachuu nan danda'a
You think you know everything about them.	Waa'ee isaanii waan hunda waan beektu sitti fakkaata.
That it isn’t anyone.	Nama tokkollee akka hin taane.
I think it goes with the environment	Naannoo sanaa wajjin ni deema jedheen yaada
I told him a couple of weeks	Torban lama lama itti hime
It wasn’t the real one.	Kan dhugaa hin turre.
I can help a lot of people	Namoota baay'ee gargaaruu nan danda'a
There is a chance.	Carraan jira.
It happened a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ta'ee ture.
I saw none of that yesterday	Kaleessa sana keessaa tokkollee hin argine
I'm sure it's good for him.	Isaaf gaarii akka ta'e mirkanaa'adha.
You have to come.	Dhufuu qabda.
I think it’s obvious that it’s not.	Akka hin taane ifa natti fakkaata.
That's not what's happening here.	Asitti waan ta'aa jiru kanuma miti.
You are just the same as everyone else.	Ati nama hundumaa wajjin tokko qofa.
He knew the way well	Karaa sana sirriitti beeka ture
I don't know how to do it.	Ani gochuu hin beeku.
Some people just have everything.	Namoonni tokko tokko waan hundumaa qofa qabu.
So maybe it will work.	Kanaaf tarii ni hojjeta ta'a.
I am currently looking for a job	Yeroo ammaa kana hojii barbaadaa jira
Not that that’s what she was doing, really.	Waan isheen hojjechaa turte akkas jechuu miti, dhuguma.
I have been trying them.	Isaan yaalaa tureera.
Most people are not like that	Namoonni baay'een akkas miti
I think you could have done something.	Silaa waan tokko gochuu dandeessa jedheen yaada.
Now he looked at her.	Amma ishee ilaale.
They were more like people.	Isaan caalaatti namoota fakkaatu turan.
We don’t have it.	Hin qabnu.
I know what he’s doing	Waan inni godhu nan beeka
He never goes to a school.	Inni gonkumaa mana barumsaa tokko hin deemu.
He wasn’t there.	Inni achi hin turre.
In my house.	Mana koo keessatti.
This might work very well.	Kun tarii baay'ee gaarii ta'ee hojjechuu danda'a.
We didn’t have a name for it.	Maqaa itti hin qabnu turre.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
In every section.	Kutaa hunda keessatti.
It works very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
It didn’t go well.	Gaarii hin deemne.
A sense that something isn’t quite right	Miira wanti tokko guutummaatti sirrii hin taane jedhu
I don’t know why it didn’t work.	Maaliif akka hin hojjenne hin beeku.
They tell us what we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu nutti himu.
I don’t have a favorite.	Ani jaalladhu hin qabu.
He knew it was a mistake.	Dogoggora akka taʼe ni beeka ture.
What we don't know is what happens after that.	Wanti nuti hin beekne sana booda maaltu ta'a.
All she knew was that he was gone.	Wanti isheen beektu, inni hin jiru qofa ture.
I was totally going to do it	Ani guutummaatti hojjechuuf ture
It was a little before my time.	Yeroon koo xiqqoo dura ture.
I wondered if he had children.	Ijoollee qabaa jedheen yaade.
They want him to go.	Akka deemu barbaadu.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
Maybe it's good.	Tarii gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
This is nothing.	Kun homaa miti.
That was always the real me.	Yeroo hundumaa ana dhugaa kanuma ture.
I didn't do a very good job of that	Ani hojii baayyee gaarii sana hin hojjenne
Children, they know everything.	Ijoollee, waan hunda beeku.
You will love it.	Ni jaallattu.
It seemed a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura fakkaata ture.
But we weren't.	Nuti garuu hin turre.
I still want it on the eyes all the time	Ammallee yeroo hunda ija irratti barbaada
I didn't know.	Hin beekne.
We've been doing this a lot.	Kana baay'ee hojjechaa turre.
I need you to go to your father	Abbaa kee bira akka deemtu si barbaachisa
I had no question it was true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa gaaffii hin qabu ture
Tell them we can do better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu akka dandeenyu itti himi.
But look at us.	Garuu nu ilaalaa.
They have a name.	Maqaa qabu.
He said he only saw it once.	Yeroo tokko qofa arge jedhe.
It was lucky, I thought	Carraa ta'ee ture jedheen yaade
Then I would think	Sana booda nan yaada ture
This is very different.	Kun baayyee adda.
You just have to do it.	Ati qofa gochuu qabda.
But he did so much more.	Garuu kana caalaa waan baay'ee hojjete.
It can't be anything.	Homaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Not ahead of time.	Yeroo dura miti.
Not on me.	Ana irratti miti.
It shouldn’t have gone that way.	Silaa akkasitti deemuu hin qabu ture.
They are only doing one job.	Hojii tokko qofa hojjechaa jiru.
You know, this is my opinion.	Beektaa kun yaada kooti.
He must give it to him.	Isaaf kennuu qaba.
If it were easy, everyone would do it.	Osoo salphaa ta'ee namni hundi ni hojjeta ture.
I still have some on my hat	Ammallee kophee koo irra tokko tokko qaba
You can see their thoughts.	Yaada isaanii arguu dandeessu.
I still don’t do that	Ammas akkas hin godhu
It didn’t, it didn’t, it didn’t.	Hin, hin taane, hin taane.
But that wasn’t entirely true.	Garuu sun guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre.
So he should get this job.	Kanaaf hojii kana argachuu qaba.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I know about it.	Waa'ee isaa nan beeka.
I think you like her	Ishee jaallattu jedheen yaada
I want everything he just said and more	Waan inni amma dubbate hundumaa fi kana caalaa nan barbaada
So I love her too much	Kanaaf garmalee ishee jaalladha
I will be life to you	Ani jireenya siif ta'a
I can get them.	Isaan argachuu nan danda'a.
Just like at home.	Akkuma mana keessatti.
Not exactly sure	Sirriitti mirkanaa'aa miti
It could be something else.	Kan biraa ta’uu danda’a.
Something seemed different about her, but I wasn't sure what.	Waa'ee ishee wanti tokko adda fakkaata ture, garuu maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It was a language.	Afaan ture.
It was a great job.	Hojii guddaa ture.
I could see it just fine	Ani akka gaariitti arguu nan dandaʼa ture
What's going on.	Waan deemaa jiru.
Now I have two of yours	Amma kan kee lama qaba
Not even her name.	Maqaa ishee illee miti.
I had no one to tell me what was going to happen	Nama maaltu akka ta'u natti himu hin qabu ture
Some nights.	Halkan tokko tokko.
I say this again here	Kanaan asitti ammas jedha
I told you everything	Waan hundumaa sitti hime
I don't want to know	Ani beekuu hin barbaadu
Right now it was one of those times.	Yeroo ammaa kana yeroo sana keessaa tokko ture.
He becomes one with his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa waliin tokko ta'a.
I haven’t spoken to her in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee waliin hin dubbanne
That would be right.	Sun sirrii ta'a.
I don’t always think that way	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti hin yaadu
No one wants to .	Namni tokko hin barbaadu .
It could not have been otherwise.	Silaa akkas ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
That is a possibility.	Sun taʼuu dandaʼa.
I want to apologize to you	Dhiifama isin gaafachuu barbaada
It was pretty easy.	Baay'ee salphaa ture.
I don’t want to leave him.	Isa dhiisuu hin barbaadu.
I wasn't sure what happened	Waan ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I didn't want to have to do this.	Kana gochuun dirqama ta'uu hin barbaanne.
He probably won't be.	Inni hin ta'u ta'uu hin oolu.
I intended to stay here, with you	As turuuf yaade, si waliin
It looked bad.	Hamaa fakkaata ture.
I didn't realize that could happen .	Akkas ta'uu akka danda'u hin hubanne .
You there still.	Ati achitti ammallee.
I wonder how you know about it	Akkamitti waa'ee isaa beekta jedheen yaada
It just wasn’t in him.	Isa keessa hin turre qofa.
I think everyone enjoyed that	Namni hundi waan sanatti gammade natti fakkaata
She just had .	Isheen qofa qabdi turte .
I was trying to make a bit of a joke	Xiqqoo qoosaa hojjechuuf yaalaa ture
It seems that it is not.	Akkas miti fakkaata.
I love you more than you think	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa si jaalladha
It’s his and mine.	Kan isaa fi kan kooti.
It was so much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee ture.
I don't want anyone else.	Ani nama biraa hin barbaadu.
There was nothing I could do but go home.	Mana kootti deebi'uu malee wanti godhu hin turre.
I didn't know it was happening	Akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
It hasn’t worked for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hin hojjenne.
I have no idea what he was doing there	Achitti maal hojjechaa akka ture yaada hin qabu
I know you better.	Caalaatti si beeka.
I didn't know how it would happen	Akkamitti akka ta'u hin beeku ture
She was a little something.	Isheen xiqqoo waan tokko turte.
It 's not just	Qofa miti .
But he loves you.	Garuu si jaallata.
Again, we agreed.	Ammas walii galle.
It's just so bad.	Akka malee hamaa qofa.
That hasn’t happened yet.	Sun hanga ammaatti hin taane.
Not.	Miti.
I think you’ll love it.	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada.
It could still be his work.	Ammas hojii isaa ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't think so.	Ani akkas jedhee hin yaadne.
Nothing has passed.	Kan darbe hin jiru.
She hadn’t gone away.	Isheen hin deemne turte.
It’s still working.	Ammallee hojjechaa jira.
I know what you did tonight.	Halkan kana maal akka goote nan beeka.
They knew who he was.	Eenyu akka ta'e ni beeku turan.
I hope that will be the case.	Akkas akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
I’m not there yet.	Ani ammallee achi hin jiru.
But I knew it wasn’t	Akka hin taane garuu nan beeka ture
That's happening.	Sun ta'aa jira.
I am a mother.	Ani haadha.
It’s devouring.	Nama nyaata.
That was something she hadn’t thought of before.	Sun waan isheen kanaan dura hin yaadne ture.
What does it look like?.	Maal fakkaata?.
I have no idea what is going on	Waan deemaa jiru yaada hin qabu
You know better.	Ati caalaatti beekta.
You all know it.	Hundi keessan ni beektu.
It’s not just who you are.	Eenyu akka taate qofa miti.
When, she didn’t know.	Yoom, isheen hin beekne.
But it just doesn’t work in this way.	Garuu haala kanaan qofa hin hojjetu.
I know we would have none of that	Silaa sana keessaa tokkollee akka hin qabne nan beeka
But they were wrong about that.	Garuu waa'ee sanaa dogoggora turan.
Other than that, they can be very different	Kanaan ala baay’ee adda ta’uu danda’u
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
It was going to be great.	Guddaa ta'uuf ture.
I thought it was right	Sirrii natti fakkaate
Now it is needed.	Amma barbaachisa.
That's very accurate.	Baayyee sirrii dha.
Past.	Kan darbe.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
She could shop around with him, so she said.	Isheen naannoo isaa isa waliin bitachuu dandeessu, kanaaf jette.
Your situation is not now.	Haala keessan amma miti.
Some time passed, but no one spoke	Yeroon tokko darbe, garuu namni dubbate hin jiru
Every moment is nice.	Yeroon hundi namatti tola.
I always wanted to have a bar, you know	Yeroo hundumaa mana dhugaatii qabaachuu nan barbaada ture, beekta
He always wanted a dog	Yeroo hundumaa saree barbaada ture
I think about this a lot	Waa'ee kanaa baay'een yaada
I’m all over it.	Ani hunda irra jira.
It was absolutely right.	Guutummaatti sirrii ture.
But I was wrong about that	Ani garuu waaʼee sanaa dogoggora ture
Maybe you can.	Tarii ni dandeessu ta'a.
I've been here a couple of months now	Amma ji'a lama lama as ture
Maybe he was in on it.	Tarii irratti keessa ture ta'a.
It seems to work very well.	Baayyee gaarii waan hojjetu fakkaata.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
Someone was out there.	Namni tokko achi ala ture.
I mean like never	Akka gonkumaa jechuu kooti
Of course, he needs money.	Maallaqa akka isa barbaachisu beekamaadha.
Of course, this is not always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I can't believe how things turned out for me	Wanti akkamitti akka naaf ta'e amanuu hin danda'u
You know how this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu ni beektu.
I didn’t notice anything anymore.	Kana booda homaa hin hubanne.
He quickly thought more about it.	Dafee kana caalaa itti yaade.
She knew nothing.	Isheen homaa hin beektu turte.
I think they were pretty accurate	Isaan baay'ee sirrii turan jedheen yaada
I know the way to go	Karaa itti deemu nan beeka
It can be all of these things.	Wantoota kana hunda ta’uu danda’a.
Check out the full episode.	Guutuu isaa ilaalaa.
Not now, against this man.	Amma miti, nama kana irratti.
I wanted to get to know them a little better.	Xiqqoo isaan beekuu barbaade.
I know you already know this	Kana duruu akka beektu nan beeka
I had no intention of going with him	Isa waliin deemuuf yaada hin qabu ture
We are in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jirra.
I know why we haven’t seen more	Kana caalaa maaliif akka hin argine nan beeka
It’s very dangerous.	Baayyee balaa qaba.
What could be more obvious.	Kana caalaa maaltu ifa ta'uu danda'a.
I know about these things.	Waa'ee wantoota kanaa nan beeka.
I don’t think there is one.	Tokko waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
I could never go home	Yoomiyyuu gara manaatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
That’s my problem, not theirs.	Sun rakkoo kooti malee kan isaanii miti.
But it just looked too bad.	Garuu garmalee hamaa qofa fakkaata ture.
But there is nothing inevitable about this.	Kana keessa garuu wanti hin oolle hin jiru.
I think it's a slow motion.	jedheen yaada.
But he was no longer that person.	Garuu kana booda nama sana hin turre.
I think he loves me.	Inni na jaallatu natti fakkaata.
It took hours and hours.	Sa'aatii fi sa'aatii fudhate.
No one is coming to help you.	Namni si gargaaruuf dhufu hin jiru.
I have no idea what this is	Kun maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
Look for a picture.	Suuraa barbaadaa.
I know a lot about this	Waa'ee kanaa waan baay'een beeka
He needs forgiveness.	Dhiifama isa barbaachisa.
Then it goes one of three places.	Sana booda bakka sadii keessaa tokko deema.
Totally and completely so.	Guutummaatti fi guutummaatti akkas.
If you know, you know.	Yoo beekta ta'e ni beekta.
I wanted to be with him	Isa waliin ta'uu barbaade
I want to get back to my life.	Jireenya kootti deebi'uu barbaada.
You.	Ati.
It was a great opportunity.	Carraa guddaa ture.
I couldn't do it now.	Amma hin dandeenye.
I shouldn’t have it.	Ani qabaachuu hin qabu.
I know that name	Maqaa sana nan beeka
It always happens here.	Yeroo hunda asitti ni ta'a.
It was still there though.	Ammas achi ture garuu.
He has money, lots of money	Maallaqa qaba, maallaqa baay'ee qaba
Everyone but one.	Namni hundi tokko malee.
An important person.	Nama barbaachisaa.
I don’t understand any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee naaf hin galle
But it happens all the time.	Garuu yeroo hunda ni ta'a.
Tomorrow will be a full day.	Boru guyyaa guutuu ta'a.
This is probably not the case.	Kun ta'uu hin oolu.
I want to get to know her better	Caalaatti ishee beekuu barbaada
I still want that.	Ammallee sana barbaada.
That's what she said.	Kana jette.
Something could happen.	Wanti tokko taʼuu dandaʼa.
That is not the case here.	Asitti akkas miti.
Then it will be fine.	Sana booda gaarii ta'a.
That may not be easy.	Sun salphaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I’ve been waiting for you for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf si eegaa ture
You're still not so into him.	Ammas akkasitti isa keessa hin jirtu.
I couldn’t find anything	Homaa argachuu hin dandeenye
Look at this and this.	Kanaa fi kana ilaalaa.
That's about it.	Waa'ee isaa kanuma.
He already knew the truth	Dhugaa jiru duruu beeka ture
Now I think that was a mistake	Amma sun dogoggora ture jedheen yaada
This is not that time.	Yeroon kun yeroo sana miti.
I don't understand that	Sana naaf hin galle
I didn’t know anyone with a dog	Nama saree qabu hin beeku ture
But with everything else.	Garuu waan hundumaa waliin.
I love her ideas	Yaada ishee baay'een jaalladha
He had no name.	Maqaa hin qabu ture.
I can't help you again	Ammas si gargaaruu hin danda'u
She was enough for him and his feelings.	Isaa fi miira isaa gahaa turte.
Question.	Gaaffii.
I knew it was a big deal	Waan guddaa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
He has enough food.	Nyaata gahaa qaba.
I had said, 'It's not.	jedheen ture.
I didn't want that.	Kana hin barbaanne.
I had to do it again	Ammas gochuun qaba ture
It does him good.	Gaarii isaaf godha.
He obviously has a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa akka qabu ifaadha.
I don’t want to stay here in the house	As mana keessa turuu hin barbaadu
I never want to be without you again	Amma booda gonkumaa si malee jiraachuu hin barbaadu
She’s right, of course.	Isheen sirrii dha, beekamaadha.
It was never about that.	Waa'ee sanaa ta'ee hin beeku.
Maybe he didn't really want to.	Tarii dhuguma hin barbaanne ta'a.
He was a really nice guy.	Dhuguma nama gaarii ture.
Nobody just talked about ideas.	Namni waa'ee yaada qofa dubbate hin jiru.
Just one problem.	Rakkoo tokko qofa.
You know my work.	Hojii koo ni beekta.
Now that’s it.	Amma kanuma.
That's how I'm looking at it	Akkasitti ilaalaa jira
But obviously you do.	Garuu akka gootu ifaadha.
I thought it was what she wanted	Waan isheen barbaaddu natti fakkaate
He was right!.	Inni sirrii ture!.
It’s not my job.	Hojii koo miti.
You have to be willing.	Fedhii qabaachuu qabda.
It was a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii ture.
I think she has more shoes than clothes	Uffata caalaa kophee waan qabdu natti fakkaata
I don't know how to do it though.	Akkamitti akkan godhu garuu hin beeku.
I don't know who she is.	Eenyu akka taate hin beeku.
I just couldn’t forgive him	Dhiifama isaaf qofa gochuu hin dandeenye
You would have to be funny.	Silaa nama qoosaa ta'uu qabda turte.
He’s some guy off the street.	Inni gurbaa tokko tokko karaa irraa.
It was somewhere else	Bakka biraa ture
I don't think this happened	Kun waan ta'e natti hin fakkaatu
Sometimes he did that.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas godha ture.
I don’t do that.	Akkas hin godhu.
I can't say enough good things about it	Waa'ee isaa waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
Probably not, but you might have a chance.	Tarii hin ta'u, garuu carraa argachuu dandeessa.
You didn’t want to.	Ati hin barbaanne.
I think it came out well	Akka gaariitti ba'e natti fakkaata
I can't tell you about them right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waa'ee isaanii sitti himuu hin danda'u
He didn't want to see anyone	Nama arguu hin barbaanne
I don't know your name.	Maqaa kee hin beeku.
Only not always the same people.	Qofa yeroo hunda namoota tokko miti.
It wouldn't have been so easy.	Silaa akkas salphaa hin ta'u ture.
I think that was all	Kana qofa ture jedheen yaada
A week passed.	Torban tokko darbe.
I think it looks ridiculous	Qoosaa fakkaata jedheen yaada
I was trying to be nice	Ani nama gaarii ta'uuf yaalaa ture
I can't get enough of him	Isa gahaa argachuu hin danda'u
I am nothing and everything.	Ani homaa fi waan hundumaa miti.
So it looks a bit like here.	Kanaaf xiqqoo as fakkaata.
He wants us to do it.	Inni akka nuti goonu barbaada.
I have been wanting to say that	Akkas jechuu barbaadaa tureera
I love playing with him	Isa waliin taphachuu nan jaalladha
Had it a year ago.	Waggaa tokko dura qaba ture.
It can be the simplest of things.	Wantoota keessaa isa salphaa ta’uu danda’a.
He has money, he has a lot of money	Maallaqa qaba, maallaqa guddaa qaba
I don't think it will be human	Nama ta'a jedhee hin yaadu
Which they never wanted to happen.	Kan isaan tasumaa akka ta’u hin barbaanne.
He looked at the shoes again	Ammas kophee sana ilaale
It doesn’t even work.	Illee hin hojjetu.
I never know his name.	Maqaa isaa gonkumaa hin beeku.
It just worked together.	Waliin hojjete qofa.
Sometimes even things.	Yeroo tokko tokko waan illee.
I don't want him.	Ani isa hin barbaadu.
I want to be back in my house	Mana koo keessa deebi'uu barbaada
I think you always have	Yeroo hundumaa waan qabdu natti fakkaata
I don't know what to say.	Waan jedhu hin beeku.
I want that kind of life	Jireenya akkasii nan barbaada
He wouldn't go.	Inni hin deemu ture.
He should know your mother better than you do	Haadha kee si caalaa beekuu qaba
It doesn’t help.	Hin gargaaru.
I wondered why this was	Kun maaliif akka ta'e jedheen yaade
Maybe that's not even the case.	Tarii sun illee ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
That’s for a reason.	Sun sababa qaba.
She was fine.	Isheen gaarii turte.
But once she was outside.	Yeroo tokko garuu ala turte.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I don't think anything of it	Ani homaa itti hin yaadu
It was a terrible thing.	Waan hamaa ture.
It didn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu ture.
He got a life.	Jireenya argate.
It's really obvious that this will happen.	Kun akka ta'u dhuguma ifaadha.
I think he's a good man	Nama gaarii natti fakkaata
I didn’t want to do that	Ani akkas gochuu hin barbaanne
I thought it would be very different.	Baayyee adda ta'a jedheen yaade.
He needed money.	Maallaqa isa barbaachisa ture.
I can't do it.	Ani gochuu hin danda'u.
But he doesn't do anything like that.	Garuu waan akkasii hin hojjetu.
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
It would have been that easy.	Silaa akkas salphaa ture.
I knew he was around	Naannoo sana akka jiru nan beeka ture
Then they are idle.	Sana booda hojii malee jiru.
I know you care about me	Akka naaf yaaddu nan beeka
I want to stop doing that in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti akkas gochuu dhiisuu nan barbaada.
That’s how it all works.	Hundi akkasitti hojjeta.
We are in this together.	Kana keessa waliin jirra.
That’s very likely.	Sun carraa guddaa qaba.
Sorry, but I must say.	Dhiifama garuu jechuun dirqama.
But I didn’t know enough about such things.	Garuu waa’ee wantoota akkasii gahaa hin beeku ture.
I don't think that would be a problem, but you never know.	Sun rakkoo ta'a jedhee hin yaadu, garuu ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
I wanted him so badly.	Ani akka malee isa barbaade.
I just can't quit	Dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u
I have two questions	Gaaffii lama qaba
This worked very well.	Kun baayyee gaarii hojjete.
You are in the wrong place.	Bakka hin taane jirta.
He wanted to be with her tonight	Halkan kana ishee waliin ta'uu barbaade
He should make that very clear	Sana baayyee ifa gochuu qaba
But he was wrong about you.	Waa'ee kee garuu dogoggora ture.
Hopefully.	Abdii guutuu.
It’s not a big deal so far.	Hanga ammaatti waan guddaa miti.
So he just did what he knew how to do.	Kanaaf waan hojjechuu beeku qofa hojjete.
You need my space here	Bakka koo asitti isin barbaachisa
We are all in danger.	Hundi keenya balaa keessa jirra.
Later, the book.	Booda, kitaaba.
I didn't tell you.	Ani sitti hin himne.
He was here today.	Har'a as ture.
They know this.	Kanaan ni beeku.
I had it pretty good really	Ani baay'ee gaarii qaba ture dhuguma
But he knew what was happening.	Garuu waan ta'aa jiru ni beeka ture.
I haven’t spoken to her in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf ishee waliin hin dubbanne
Can't find anything on it.	Irratti homaa argachuu hin danda'u.
I think that’s the reason he gave	Sababni inni kenne kanuma natti fakkaata
I didn’t know there was such a thing	Wanti akkasii akka jiru hin beeku ture
It was too big.	Garmalee guddaa ture.
I was alone, she was watching	Ani kophaa koo ture, isheen ilaalaa turte
I love you both so much	Lamaan keessan baay'een jaalladha
I always wanted to do that	Yeroo hundumaa akkas gochuu nan barbaada ture
That I often am.	Yeroo baay'ee akkan ta'a.
It has a long way to go	Karaa dheeraa qaba
I hope you don’t see me in this	Kana keessatti akka na hin argine abdiin qaba
They love it more.	Caalaatti ni jaallatu.
I have.	Ani ... qaba.
I knew it was you.	Ati akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
It’s not mine anymore.	Kana booda kan koo miti.
It’s working well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
I couldn’t make it work very well	Baayyee akka gaariitti akka hojjetu gochuu hin dandeenye
But they need your help.	Garuu gargaarsa keessan isaan barbaachisa.
I know you know who you are	Eenyu akka taate akka beektu nan beeka
More likely several weeks.	Caalaatti torban hedduu.
Looks like a good opportunity.	Carraa gaarii fakkaata.
He just did what he could.	Waan danda'u qofa hojjete.
That's how they can work.	Akkasitti hojjechuu danda'u.
Later I saw him in his room.	Booda kutaa isaa keessatti isa arge.
My mom, she’s not into that.	Haadha koo, isheen sana keessa hin jirtu.
She didn’t need to.	Isheen hin barbaachifne.
It was an opportunity.	Carraa ture.
They are old school.	Isaan mana barumsaa durii dha.
When they don’t have it.	Yeroo isaan hin qabne.
There is no problem here.	Asitti rakkoon hin jiru.
I think he has the right idea	Yaada sirrii qaba jedheen yaada
Now I know why she loves it	Amma maaliif akka isheen jaallattu nan beeka
I know what you were looking for	Waan ati barbaadaa turte nan beeka
She has no sense of humor at all.	Tasumaa miira qoosaa hin qabdu.
I wanted to get it right	Sirriitti argachuu barbaade
You will be needed.	Isin ni barbaachisa.
I can't tell you what to do or not to do	Waan gootu fi hin goone sitti himuu hin danda'u
I knew better than to ask	Gaafachuu caalaa nan beeka ture
I still couldn’t see her	Ammallee ishee arguu hin dandeenye
But it was better than not good.	Garuu gaarii hin taane caalaa gaarii ture.
I think it was probably me	Ana ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada
I don't do anything about it.	Kana irratti homaa hin godhu.
That he knows.	Akka inni beeku.
He started walking towards me.	Gara kootti deemuu jalqabe.
You have to know.	Beekuu qabda.
This does two things.	Kun waan lama hojjeta.
I couldn't have done this without you	Osoo ati hin taane kana gochuu hin danda'u ture
I never wanted to come here	Ani tasumaa as dhufuu hin barbaanne
Everything is absolutely fine.	Wanti hundi guutummaatti gaarii dha.
I can't go back inside	Keessatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
I need you so much.	Baay'een si barbaada.
No one knew us.	Namni nu beeku hin turre.
I don't want to know.	Ani beekuu hin barbaadu.
If you do nothing, nothing happens.	Yoo homaa hin goone wanti ta'u hin jiru.
That was her worst moment.	Yeroon sun yeroo hamaa ishee ture.
I wasn’t like that.	Ani akkas hin turre.
I haven’t noticed him yet.	Hanga ammaatti isa hin hubanne.
I know what you care about me	Waan ati naaf yaaddu nan beeka
It doesn't have to do much, really.	Baay'ee hojjechuu hin qabu, dhuguma.
So that was good.	Kanaaf sun gaarii ture.
You just couldn’t believe it	Ati qofa amanuu hin dandeenye
Much better than last time though.	Yeroo darbe caalaa baay'ee garuu miira gaarii qaba.
So I'm very excited.	Kanaaf baay'een gammadeera.
Everyone thinks about it is my opinion, a lot	Namni hundi itti yaadu yaada kooti, ​​baay'ee
I should never have given up on him	Silaa gonkumaa isaaf dhiisuu hin qabu ture
I really want to get to know you.	Dhuguma si beekuu barbaada.
It’s not our day.	Guyyaa keenya miti.
No one answered.	Namni deebii kenne hin jiru.
I thought it was such a big deal	Ani akkas waan guddaa natti fakkaate
They should have the same sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa wal fakkaatu qabaachuu qabu.
That sounds like him.	Sun akka isaa fakkaata.
Not everyone is like me.	Namni hundi akka koo miti.
I think about you a lot	Waa'ee kee baay'een yaada
It could be the worst thing we could do in reality.	Wanti dhugaa jiru keessatti gochuu dandeenyu hunda caalaa hamaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I think you have one inside of you	Keessa kee keessaa tokko waan qabdu natti fakkaata
I am not such a person.	Ani nama akkasii miti.
He would have loved it.	Silaa ni jaallatu ture.
I wonder if anyone knows if that is the case	Akkas ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa namni beeku jiraa jedheen yaada
He would make such a good father.	Abbaa gaarii akkasii ni godha ture.
I had your wife a few hours ago	Sa'aatii muraasa dura haadha manaa keessan qaba ture
She's probably right.	Isheen sirrii ta'uu hin oolu.
They can do something simple.	Waan salphaa ta'e hojjechuu danda'u.
That one is different.	Inni sun adda.
Said.	Jedhe.
It’s not all important.	Hundi isaa barbaachisaa miti.
I didn’t talk to her	Ani ishee waliin hin dubbanne
Which is not the case.	Kan hin taane.
Look around you inside.	Mee keessa naannoo keessan ilaalaa.
He might never do anything again	Tarii kana booda gonkumaa homaa gochuu dhiisuu dandaʼa
I can't stay here any longer	Kana caalaa as turuu hin danda'u
I hoped this wasn't about me	Kun waa'ee koo akka hin taane abdiin qaba ture
He stared at her for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ija keessa ilaale.
Everything but nothing.	Waan hundumaa malee homaa miti.
This has not been the case for some time.	Kun yeroo muraasaaf hin taane.
That he did.	Akka inni godhe.
I'm sure it doesn't.	Akka hin taane mirkanaa'adha.
The man watching her, however.	Namni ishee ilaalaa jiru garuu.
But he never did.	Garuu gonkumaa hin goone.
Nothing too bad.	Wanti garmalee hamaa hin jiru.
We went to the house.	Gara manaatti deemne.
He is looking at our mistakes	Dogoggora keenya ilaalaa jira
Not even a little bit	Xiqqoo illee miti
This may indeed be the case, but it’s not the only one.	Kun dhuguma ta’uu danda’a, garuu isa qofa miti.
But in this case it does.	Garuu haala kana keessatti ni ta’a.
When, exactly.	Yoom, sirriitti.
I love my mother.	Haadha koo nan jaalladha.
Not as bad as you though.	Akka kee hamaa miti garuu.
I just didn't see it.	Qofa hin argine.
It’s just my room.	Kutaa koo qofa.
That could be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
He was truly a great teacher.	Dhuguma barsiisaa guddaa ture.
I wasn't sure what he meant.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Someone who was there told me.	Namni achi ture tokko natti hime.
They didn’t have it.	Hin qaban turan.
He knows his stuff.	Waan isaa ni beeka.
He wasn't sure if he was going or not	Deemu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
It goes inside.	Keessatti deema.
I can't make you do it	Akka hojjetu si gochuu hin danda'u
I can't believe what we don't know	Waan nuti hin beekne amanuu hin danda'u
Now you can go home.	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
He speaks the truth.	Dhugaa ni dubbata.
He was just doing his job.	Hojii isaa qofa hojjechaa ture.
She seemed to be .	Isheen akka waan .
I didn’t know the name	Maqaa hin beeku ture
He saw that it would happen.	Akka ta'u arge.
It has everything you need	Waan si barbaachisu hunda qaba
They have no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban.
I hope that’s not a mistake	Sun dogoggora akka hin taane abdiin qaba
He still had questions.	Ammallee gaaffii qaba ture.
It works now.	Amma hojjeta.
I'm not the only one who came out	Kan ba'e ana qofa miti
It works well for me.	Akka gaariitti naaf hojjeta.
Because I know it is now	Sababni isaa amma akka ta'e nan beeka
I'm waiting for an answer	Deebii eegaa jira
We didn’t really do anything just to do something.	Dhuguma waan tokko hojjechuuf qofa waan hin hojjenne.
He wouldn't have gone.	Silaa hin deemu ture.
I didn't know it was so bad	Akkas hamaa akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I think he got something	Waan argate jedheen yaada
You really don’t need it.	Dhuguma si hin barbaachisu.
He can make mistakes.	Dogoggora hojjechuu danda'a.
It can happen in the long run.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti ta’uu danda’a.
I need to know everything	Waan hundumaa beekuu na barbaachisa
I can't be without you	Si malee ta'uu hin danda'u
I want to ask if it passed.	Darbe jedheen gaafachuu barbaada.
Really checked that one out.	Dhuguma isa sana ilaale.
It was one o'clock in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii tokko ture.
Now he came.	Amma dhufe.
She didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beektu turte.
You are the right person for me.	Ati naaf nama sirrii dha.
You don’t want that.	Ati akkas hin barbaaddu.
You can’t talk to her like that.	Akkasitti ishee dubbachuu hin dandeessu.
But, obviously, that is not the case.	Garuu, akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
That’s what I thought at the time	Yeroo sanatti akkas jedheen yaade
I thought this was what he wanted.	Anis waan inni barbaadu kana natti fakkaate.
Everyone did that.	Namni hundi akkas godhe.
But he had his moments.	Garuu yeroo isaa qaba ture.
It was my whole life	Jireenya koo guutuu ture
There was definitely something very wrong about them.	Waa'ee isaanii wanti baay'ee dogoggora ta'e akka ture beekamaadha.
We did it well.	Akka gaariitti hojjenne.
Except that this was real life.	Kun jireenya dhugaa akka ture malee.
Easy to handle and go	Qabduu fi deemuu salphaa
I didn’t think she wanted anything more	Kana caalaa waan barbaaddu natti hin fakkaatu ture
I could never do anything like that	Waan akkasii hojjechuu gonkumaa hin dandeenye
Maybe her clothes.	Tarii uffata ishee.
I have to admit he was good	Inni gaarii akka ture amanuu qaba
I know that dress	Uffata sana nan beeka
It still matters.	Ammallee dhimma qaba.
That happens all the time in here.	Sun yeroo hunda as keessa ta'a.
Sometimes a little thing, sometimes a big thing.	Yeroo tokko tokko waan xiqqoo, yeroo tokko tokko waan guddaa.
Why are you so good.	Maaliif akkas gaarii taate.
Tell me what it looks like.	Maal akka fakkaatu natti himi.
Now, you have this opportunity again.	Amma, carraa kanaan ammas qabdu.
But this is not, and never has been.	Garuu kun akkas miti, ta'ee hin beeku.
I’m trying to help, but you have to tell me everything.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa jira, garuu waan hundumaa natti himuu qabda.
I don’t tell them what to believe.	Waan isaan amanuu qaban itti hin himu.
Now they only have three.	Amma sadii qofa qabu.
There was no time to ask.	Yeroon gaafachuu hin turre.
Everyone was right.	Namni hundi sirrii ture.
He said a couple of days	Guyyaa lama lama jedhe
I just want to say .	Ani jechuu barbaada qofa .
I didn’t think she wanted that.	Akkas waan barbaaddu natti hin fakkaatu ture.
That was a while ago though.	Sun garuu yeroo muraasa dura ture.
You are nothing.	Ati homaa miti.
He has perfect parents.	Warra guutuu qaba.
We all have it.	Hundi keenya qabna.
With two children.	Ijoollee lama waliin.
Only one situation.	Haala tokko qofa.
So we looked for a way to do that.	Kanaaf karaa sana itti goonu barbaanne.
How many, I cannot tell.	Meeqa, jedhee himuu hin danda'u.
You can't be evil.	Hamaa ta'uu hin dandeessu.
sorry it took me so long.	dhiifama yeroo dheeraa natti fudhate.
He knows exactly what he can do.	Waan inni gochuu danda'u sirriitti beeka.
Just a lot of that kind of stuff.	Waan akkasii baay'ee qofa.
I like that about him	Waa'ee isaa akkas natti tola
It was a good time.	Yeroon sun yeroo gaarii ture.
I know about these things	Waa'ee wantoota kanaa nan beeka
He has.	Inni qaba.
For a long time neither of them said anything.	Yeroo dheeraaf lamaan isaaniiyyuu homaa hin dubbanne.
I love his hands, his mouth	Harka isaa, afaan isaa nan jaalladha
I was a good teacher	Ani barsiisaa gaarii ture
I think maybe you can help me	Tarii na gargaaruu dandeessu jedheen yaada
I just knew he was right	Ani garuu sirrii akka ta'e nan beeka ture
You are wrong.	Ati dogoggora qabda.
I wasn't sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But that could just be me.	Garuu sun ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I would never have done that at my house	Silaa mana kootti gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture
Except he didn’t.	Inni hin goone malee.
Bad money.	Maallaqa hamaa.
I thought you might be interested!	Fedhii qabaachuu dandeessa jedheen yaade!
You still have a problem.	Ammallee rakkoo qabda.
He meant more than that.	Kana caalaa jechuu isaa ture.
I never understood that	Ani gonkumaa akkas naaf hin galle
It seemed to have done the job.	Hojii waan hojjete fakkaata ture.
I can’t seem to help myself	Of gargaaruu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
Everyone seemed to know.	Namni hundi waan beeku fakkaata ture.
I thought she was you	Isheen si natti fakkaate
You can go there.	Achitti deemuun ni danda'ama.
People were really nice.	Namoonni dhuguma namatti tola turan.
Sometimes it can always mean a lot of times.	Yeroo tokko tokko yeroo hundumaa yeroo baay’ee jechuu danda’a.
This is happening.	Kun ta'aa jira.
Tell me how you want it.	Akkamitti akka barbaaddu natti himi.
I want to know what she was	Maal akka turte beekuu barbaada
Good dog, good dog.	Saree gaarii, saree gaarii.
But it may not be good for you.	Garuu siif gaarii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It’s working well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
I know it must be great	Guddaa ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka
But I couldn't tell him exactly	Ani garuu sirriitti itti himuu hin dandeenye
I just didn’t understand it	Ani garuu hin hubanne qofa
I wonder what happened.	Maal ta'e jedheen yaada.
But these were not people he knew.	Garuu kun namoota inni beeku hin turre.
He started walking down the street	Karaa irra deemuu jalqabe
But no one knows.	Garuu namni beeku hin jiru.
But it had to work.	Garuu hojjechuu qaba ture.
It was really like that.	Dhuguma akkas ture.
And I just said that.	Anis akkas jedheen qofa.
He is in danger.	Balaa keessa jira.
You’re not the only one.	Si qofa miti.
I can't seem to do anything today	Har'a homaa gochuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
This one was easy.	Inni kun salphaa ture.
He should have been here	Silaa as jiraachuu qaba ture
I couldn’t believe my good luck	Carraa gaarii koo amanuu hin dandeenye
I should have gone to her	Silaa gara ishee deemuun qaba ture
I need my money.	Maallaqa koo na barbaachisa.
If we meet again.	Yoo wal argine.
I knew he was going to do his best.	Waan danda'u hunda gochuuf akka jiru nan beeka ture.
It’s just not that simple.	Akkas salphaa miti qofa.
Maybe you just need someone to do it for you.	Tarii nama siif godhu qofa si barbaachisa ta'a.
Who is with me?.	Eenyutu na waliin jira?.
He thought he was the only one who got it.	Kan argate isa qofa itti fakkaate.
It wasn’t, though.	Hin turre malee.
It’s a good feeling.	Miira gaarii dha.
This is clearly not the case.	Kun akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
I didn't mean for it to happen that way	Akkasitti akka ta'uuf hin yaadne
I always want to	Yeroo hundumaa nan barbaada
They have their time.	Yeroo isaanii qabu.
It used to be good.	Duraan gaarii ture.
I was my father's daughter	Ani intala abbaa koo ture
There is another, more telling reason.	Sababni biraa, kana caalaa namatti himu jira.
I have a bad feeling about it	Ani waa'ee isaa miira hamaa qaba
I love you both so much	Lamaan keessan baay'een jaalladha
I didn't know it was possible	Ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku ture
I can tell you the truth.	Dhugaa jiru sitti himuu nan danda'a.
I didn’t see him.	Isa hin argine.
I used to love going home.	Duraan gara manaatti deebi'uu nan jaalladha ture.
I was doing that a lot tonight	Halkan kana baay'een akkas gochaa ture
I told him all about it	Waa'ee isaa hunda itti hime
But nothing seemed to work.	Garuu wanti tokkollee waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu ture.
But that's not the only possible answer.	Garuu deebii ta'uu danda'u kana qofa miti.
Last week it came again.	Torban darbe ammas dhufe.
You know some of these people.	Namoota kana keessaa tokko tokko ni beektu.
It was here.	Halkan ture.
I can't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin danda'u.
I can't say exactly what it is.	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti dubbachuu hin danda'u.
What he went through.	Waan keessa darbe.
I have no idea what it is	Maal akka isa ta'e yaada hin qabu
He knew little of it.	Inni waan xiqqoo beeku ture.
Many hours.	Sa'aatii baay'ee.
But I knew better than that	Ani garuu kana caalaa beeka ture
You have three.	Sadii qabda.
I'm not sure it's accurate to call this easy	Kana salphaa jechuun sirrii ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti
I haven’t been home in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf mana hin galle
I think that’s important.	Sun barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
I can't tell you anything	Homaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
I was around them a lot	Baay'een naannoo isaanii ture
But she wasn't there.	Isheen garuu hin jirtu turte.
It came around little by little.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo naannoo dhufe.
Fortunately, we are there to help you.	Akka carraa ta'ee isin gargaaruuf achi jirra.
I think you’ll love this one	Isa kana ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
That’s how it works now.	Amma akkasitti hojjeta.
Nobody really comes here anymore.	Kana booda dhuguma namni as dhufu hin jiru.
I, in real life, have always known him that way.	Ani, jireenya dhugaa keessatti, yeroo hundumaa akkasitti isa beeka.
I didn’t want this job anymore	Kana booda hojii kana hin barbaadu ture
They love us.	Nu jaallatu.
I saw him in here.	As keessa isa arge.
None of this should have happened.	Kun tokkollee ta’uu hin qabu ture.
They just weren’t good enough.	Isaan gaarii gahaa hin turre qofa.
I don't know.	Ani hin beeku.
He was always right	Yeroo hundumaa sirrii ture
I wonder if anyone is out there anymore	Kana booda namni ala jiru jiraa jedheen yaada
This happened often.	Kun yeroo baayʼee ni taʼa ture.
Look at me for years.	Waggaa na ilaalaa.
Everything was different in our house.	Mana keenya keessatti wanti hundi adda ture.
If she was, you would know.	Osoo isheen taate ni beekta turte.
Walk down the road and see where it goes.	Karaa irra deemuun eessa akka deemu ilaalaa.
I’m just a guy who loves money.	Ani gurbaa maallaqa jaallatu qofa.
I have to give him that	Sana isaaf kennuu qaba
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
I don't know anything about you	Waa'ee kee homaa hin beeku
Sometimes it may not be right.	Yeroo tokko tokko sirrii taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
But not right now.	Garuu yeroo ammaa miti.
It didn't matter who it was, or what it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e, maal akka ta'e homaa hin turre.
I know you are in big trouble now	Amma rakkoo guddaa keessa akka jirtu nan beeka
I still can't believe this	Ammallee kana amanuu hin danda'u
Except they didn’t.	Isaan hin goone malee.
I am one of these people.	Ani namoota kana keessaa tokko.
But other than that, not much.	Garuu kanaan ala baay'ee miti.
He wants that.	Sana barbaada.
I may very well do that.	Ani baay'ee gaarii ta'ee akkas gochuu danda'a.
Some people like it.	Namoonni tokko tokko ni jaallatu.
They have one daughter.	Intala tokko qabu.
I am certainly not.	Ani akkan hin taane beekamaadha.
I am a good father.	Ani abbaa gaarii dha.
Like, two years later.	Akka, waggaa lama booda.
Something is better than nothing.	Waan tokko homaa hin taane irra wayya.
But one thing	Garuu waan tokko .
We worked together once.	Yeroo tokko waliin hojjenne.
There is no one like me.	Namni akka koo hin jiru.
But it doesn't matter what just happened.	Garuu wanti amma ta'e homaa miti.
She wouldn't do that unless she had to.	Osoo dirqama ta'ee malee akkas hin gootu turte.
I just can't do it anymore.	Kana booda gochuu qofa hin danda'u.
I didn’t want any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
I don't want to talk about it.	Ani waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
I really wasn’t in any position to make the picture.	Dhuguma suuraa sana hojjechuuf haala tokkollee keessa hin turre.
He should have just stayed home	Silaa qofa mana turuu qaba ture
Glad to be with us.	Nu waliin ta'uu kootti gammadeera.
They want something.	Waan tokko barbaadu.
It’s all around you.	Naannoo kee hunda jira.
I don't have any problems.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin qabu.
I then looked at the clock	Anis sana booda sa'aatii sana ilaale
They don’t care.	Isaan dhimma hin qaban.
He was still in that position	Ammas bakka sana ture
I went through two without much trouble	Rakkoo guddaa malee lama keessa darbe
He’d go almost everywhere	Bakka hunda jechuun ni danda’ama deema ture
But very few.	Garuu baayyee muraasa.
I knew it really was	Dhuguma akka ta'e nan beeka ture
I'm not exactly sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku.
I don’t know what to do with it.	Maal akkan itti godhu hin beeku.
It wasn’t in the past.	Yeroo darbe hin turre.
It must be one of you.	Isin keessaa tokko ta'uu qaba.
He said that.	Akkas jedhe.
She was right.	Isheen sirrii turte.
I know it’s going bad	Akka hamaa deemu nan beeka
He couldn't tell anything	Homaa himuu hin dandeenye
It was enough life for me	Jireenya naaf gahaa ture
There wasn't much to see.	Waan baay'ee arguu hin turre.
I wanted to know more about that.	Waa'ee sanaa caalaatti beekuu barbaade.
It’s just not from me.	Ana irraa miti qofa.
I wasn't sure of anything	Waan tokkollee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
You’re in for something.	Waan tokko keessa jirta.
All, all, all.	Ol, ol, ol.
She said she should get it.	Argachuu qabdi jette.
I sure hope not	Akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba jedheen mirkanaa'adha
But she could not speak.	Isheen garuu dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
He had two children.	Ijoollee lama qaba ture.
There were only three of us.	Sadii qofa turre.
From everything and everyone around you.	Waan hundumaa fi nama naannoo kee jiru hunda irraa.
There was no turning back from one.	Tokko irraa deebi'uu hin turre.
It came out really well though.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'ee garuu ba'e.
We met one night.	Halkan tokko wal argine.
He might even get a new car	Konkolaataa haaraa illee argachuu dandaʼa
But I will say this	Kana garuu nan jedha
If their house.	Yoo mana isaanii.
I can't eat it.	Nyaachuu hin danda'u.
It can't be anything.	Homaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
He had every intention of doing that	Sana gochuuf yaada hunda qaba ture
Which was a lot of times.	Kan yeroo baay'ee ture.
I never really saw him again	Kana booda dhuguma tasumaa isa hin argine
I might even have something for you	Waan tokko illee siif qabaachuu danda'a
But he had other ideas.	Yaada biraa garuu qaba ture.
I like it very much	Baay'ee natti tola
I can't just stay here all night	Halkan guutuu qofa as turuu hin danda'u
You should have said that earlier.	Silaa kanaan dura akkas jechuu qabda turte.
Except that's to say.	Kana jechuu malee.
He had a few things going on.	Waan muraasa deemaa ture qaba ture.
It doesn’t mean you’re not enough.	Ati gahaa miti jechuu miti.
I am in a lot of trouble	Ani rakkoo guddaa keessa jira
Glad to see him	Isa arguu kootti gammadeera
It was a simple question.	Gaaffii salphaa ture.
Can you do this for me.	Kana naaf gochuu dandeessaa.
I think so.	Akkas jedheen yaada.
Then he started eating.	Sana booda nyaachuu jalqabe.
But, but.	Garuu, garuu.
We had it at my place.	Bakka kootti qabna turre.
So they can do that.	Kanaaf akkas gochuu danda'u.
Everything will happen.	Wanti hundi ni ta'a.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
I didn't think it would happen so soon	Akkas dafee waan ta'u natti hin fakkaatu ture
One is in the past, one is in the present.	Tokko kan darbe, tokko kan ammaa keessa jira.
I'm pretty sure it was her	Ishee akka taate mirkanaa'aa dha
I like his desire to be great.	Fedhii inni guddaa ta'uuf qabu natti tola.
Perhaps he can.	Tarii ni dandaʼa taʼa.
With one.	Tokko waliin.
These are just a few.	Isaan kun muraasa qofa.
I need time to think about it.	Yeroon itti yaadu na barbaachisa.
I said it was okay	Anis homaa hin qabu jedheen
Lots of work this week.	Torban kana hojii baay'ee.
He still had daylight	Ammallee ifa guyyaa qaba ture
Who, always has.	Eenyu, yeroo hundumaa qaba.
He was looking for answers.	Deebii barbaada ture.
You are right there.	Ati sirriitti achi jirta.
Look inside, right?.	Keessatti ilaalaa mitiiree?.
I thought to myself.	jedheen yaade.
With the past.	Kan darbe waliin.
They are going to be a big help.	Gargaarsa guddaa ta'uuf jiru.
I could always tell him the truth	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa jiru itti himuu nan dandaʼa ture
I didn’t see him like that	Akkasitti isa hin argine
Her own eyes.	Ija ofii ishee.
But they’re not easy at all	Garuu isaan tasumaa salphaa miti
It was this situation.	Haala kana turee.
I can tell you something	Waan tokko sitti himuu nan danda'a
I couldn’t do that at home	Mana keessatti akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
I understood almost nothing about them	Waa'ee isaanii homaa naaf hin galle jechuun ni danda'ama
More of her.	Caalaatti ishee.
I wouldn’t do it again	Silaa ammas hin godhu ture
I know nothing about her.	Waa'ee ishee homaa hin beeku.
She needs your help.	Gargaarsa keessan ishee barbaachisa.
I didn't understand anything	Waan tokkollee naaf hin galle
But that would never work.	Garuu sun gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
He knows what's good.	Waan gaarii ta'e ni beeka.
I could have been one of them	Silaa isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu nan danda'a ture
I already knew this was going to happen	Kun akka ta'uuf jiru duruu beeka ture
I knew it was a good idea	Yaada gaarii akka taʼe nan beeka ture
I knew it wasn’t an accident.	Balaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
But that’s not what he wants now.	Garuu amma waan barbaade kana miti.
This was happening.	Kun ta'aa ture.
I didn’t want her in my house	Mana koo keessa ishee hin barbaanne
No longer new, no longer new.	Kana booda haaraa miti, kana booda haaraa miti.
I can't believe my luck	Carraa koo amanuu hin danda'u
It's been a long time.	Baay'ee tureera.
I can't do it without you	Si malee hojjechuu hin danda'u
But she didn't.	Garuu isheen hin taane.
It should happen soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti ta'uu qaba.
I was working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa ture.
This is probably not the case	Kun akkas ta’uu dhiisuu hin oolu
I just can't anymore	Kana booda qofa hin danda'u
I don’t know how to do this.	Kana akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
He may not come.	Inni dhufuu dhiisuu danda'a.
Try it yourself!.	Ofii kee yaalaa!.
But it doesn’t matter anymore.	Garuu kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
A big part of them	Kutaa guddaa isaan keessaa
I want you to do something for me	Waan tokko akka naaf gootu nan barbaada
I knew that was what he wanted	Kan inni barbaadu akkas ta'e nan beeka ture
Therefore , it is not	Kanaaf akka hin .
One thing was true.	Wanti tokko dhugaa ture.
They have two children	Ijoollee lama qabu
I don’t have time to do that again	Ammas akkas gochuuf yeroo hin qabu
No one saw it coming.	Namni dhufuu isaa arge hin jiru.
I can't say enough about this book.	Waa'ee kitaaba kanaa gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I know why it makes me	Maaliif akka na godhu nan beeka
These are my children.	Isaan kun ijoollee kooti.
I can never have enough of that.	Sana gonkumaa gahaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
Now it’s different.	Amma adda.
We are too different.	Garmalee adda taane.
It would have looked very different then.	Silaa yeroo sanatti baayyee adda fakkaata ture.
He was even aware of that to some extent	Sana hanga tokko illee beeka ture
Anyone who wants to speak can speak.	Namni dubbachuu barbaadu hundi dubbachuu danda'a.
I don’t have her workbook yet.	Kitaaba hojii ishee hanga ammaatti hin qabu.
It wasn't good.	Gaarii hin turre.
I want them to not care.	Akka isaan dhimma hin qabne nan barbaada.
All good here except.	Hundi gaarii asitti malee.
Just a little bit.	Xiqqoo qofa.
Lucky I’m still working.	Carraa ammallee hojjechaa jiraachuu kooti.
Tell me what you need.	Waan si barbaachisu natti himi.
Everything is important, so nothing is important.	Wanti hundi barbaachisaa dha, kanaaf wanti barbaachisaa ta’e hin jiru.
Everything has been fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee jira.
People just want to be here.	Namoonni as jiraachuu qofa barbaadu.
So just eat without it.	Kanaaf isa malee nyaachuu qofa.
I really wanted to go	Ani akkan deemuuf baay'een barbaade
It was very large.	Baayyee guddaa ture.
But here, here is different.	Garuu asitti, asitti adda.
Glad to see this	Kana arguu kootti gammadeera
I thought so	Akkas jedheen yaade
I know her feelings	Miira ishee nan beeka
You can stay.	Turuu dandeessu.
That wasn’t the problem.	Rakkoon ture kanuma hin turre.
I think I can do your job	Hojii keessan hojjechuu nan danda'a jedheen yaada
I had no idea what that might mean	Sun maal jechuu akka dandaʼu yaada hin qabu ture
It was still perfectly fine.	Ammas guutummaatti gaarii ture.
I think he found what he was looking for	Waan barbaadaa ture waan argate natti fakkaata
I didn't realize that was possible	Sun ta'uu akka danda'u hin hubanne
I don’t know when mine started	Kan koo yoom akka jalqabe hin beeku
The possibilities are obvious.	Carraan jiru ifaadha.
It only happened once or twice.	Yeroo tokko lama qofa ta'e.
All that matters now is the past.	Amma wanti barbaachisaa ta'e waan darbe qofa.
I thought he was going somewhere	Bakka tokko waan deemu natti fakkaate
Not but he took it.	Fudhate malee miti.
I knew about you, though	Waa'ee kee beeka ture, garuu
You know our real name.	Maqaa keenya isa dhugaa ni beektu.
I can't go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
He became the one.	Isa ta'e.
You’re just a guy.	Ati gurbaa qofa.
Neither of us could do that.	Lamaan keenyayyuu sana hin dandeenye.
A lifetime ago really	Jireenya guutuu dura dhuguma
But something else has to happen.	Garuu wanti biraa ta'uu qaba.
I know you would have done what you could	Silaa waan dandeessu akka gootu nan beeka
That wasn’t like him.	Sun akka isaa hin turre.
What we need to do.	Waan gochuu qabnu.
I knew it would be soon	Yeroo dhiyootti akka jiru nan beeka ture
It was in some area.	Naannoo tokko tokko keessa ture.
it’s not much.	baay’ee miti.
I will never come here again	Kana booda yoomiyyuu as hin dhufu
But it’s right.	Garuu sirrii dha.
Just like the present day.	Akkuma yeroo ammaa.
This is my problem.	Kun rakkoo kooti.
It was a huge mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa ture.
I do that at home for nothing	Waan tokko malee mana keessatti akkas nan godha
All of it most of the time.	Hundi isaa yeroo baay'ee.
She didn’t need to.	Isheen hin barbaachifne.
I didn't understand what it was	Maal akka ta'e hin hubanne
I knew it would work	Akka hojjetu nan beeka ture
But this was not the case	Kun garuu akkas hin turre
He was still in the house until well after three.	Inni ammallee hanga sadii booda gaariitti mana sana keessa ture.
She was too young.	Isheen garmalee xiqqoo turte.
Maybe you have a good reason.	Tarii sababa gaarii qabda ta'a.
But many of them are the same.	Garuu baay'een isaanii tokko.
They just need fresh ideas.	Yaada haaraa qofa isaan barbaachisa.
This wasn’t the case.	Kun hin turre.
He was around a lot.	Inni baay'ee naannoo isaa ture.
I was looking outside.	Anis ala ilaalaa ture.
That was the most important thing	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe kanuma ture
This work consists of two parts.	Hojiin kun kutaa lama of keessaa qaba.
I will make him great.	Guddaa isa nan godha.
A couple of days after that	Guyyaa lama lama sana booda
I'm walking down the street	Ani karaa irra deemaa jira
He didn't talk about the situation	Waa'ee haala jiru hin dubbanne
All mine wanted today.	Kan koo hundi har'a barbaada ture.
But nobody did it.	Garuu namni godhe hin jiru.
That’s one risk.	Sun balaa tokko.
I didn’t even know your names	Maqaa keessan illee hin beeku ture
You are probably right.	Dhugaa dubbachuu kee hin oolu.
But we were able to.	Garuu ni dandeenye.
He’s doing really well.	Inni dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa jira.
I could be doing something completely wrong.	Ani waan guutummaatti dogoggora ta'e hojjechaa jiraachuu danda'a.
Met with this morning	Har'a ganama waliin wal arge
This was fortunately a simple matter.	Kun akka carraa ta'ee dhimma salphaa ture.
It would be easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa ta'a ture.
I couldn’t eat anymore	Kana booda nyaachuu hin dandeenye
I can't see a possible way	Karaa ta'uu danda'u arguu hin danda'u
I still didn’t think he was a bad person.	Ammallee nama hamaa natti hin fakkaatu ture.
Great location! 	Bakka guddaa!
That is exactly our problem.	Rakkoon keenya sirriitti kanuma.
Someone I thought you said something	Nama waan jette natti fakkaate
I haven’t had food in my mouth in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf nyaata afaan koo keessa hin qabne
This doesn't seem right.	Kun sirrii hin fakkaatu.
What is needed.	Wanti barbaachisu.
I couldn't quite see what it was.	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti arguu hin dandeenye.
I should have told you before now	Silaa amma dura sitti himuu qaba ture
Of course, you can do these things.	Wantoota kana gochuu akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
I didn't have it today.	Har'a hin qabu ture.
I wanted to give the most accurate	Kan hunda caalaa sirrii ta'e kennuu barbaade
He has a wife and children of his own.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee ofii qaba.
I think of being different	Adda ta'uu nan yaada
I think you already know the truth about it	Waa'ee isaa dhugaa jiru duruu beektu jedheen yaada
But it still doesn't work.	Garuu ammas hin hojjetu.
I can't see how it could work	Akkamitti hojjechuu akka danda'u arguu hin danda'u
I knew it would be daylight soon	Yeroo dhiyootti ifa guyyaa akka ta'u nan beeka ture
He was there that night	Halkan sana achi ture
You can have two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama qabaachuu dandeessa.
She was a real girl.	Intala dhugaa turte.
I can tell you this is definitely not my thing.	Kun waan koo akka hin taane beekamaadha sitti himuu nan danda'a.
Right now, maybe.	Yeroo ammaa kana, tarii.
The problem was the road.	Rakkoon ture karaa ture.
This has often happened.	Yeroo baay’ee kun ta’ee jira.
Hope can help.	Abdiin gargaaruu dandaʼa.
That wasn’t her job.	Hojiin ishee sun hin turre.
There is nothing special about this.	Kana keessaa wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
Not sure what is going on here.	Asitti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru mirkanaa'aa miti.
It was easy at the time.	Yeroo sanatti salphaa ture.
It was a part of my life.	Kutaa jireenya koo ture.
She had to be here.	As jiraachuu qabdi turte.
I did that of course.	Ani akkas godhe beekamaadha.
I’m good, really.	Ani gaarii dha, dhuguma.
But it's him.	Garuu isa.
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
This is not just luck.	Kun carraa qofa miti.
I was drinking.	Ani dhugaa ture.
I wonder what is that about me	Waa'ee koo maaltu akkas ta'a jedheen yaada
He made it true.	Dhugaa akka ta'u godhe.
But he just seemed like a guy.	Garuu inni gurbaa qofa fakkaata ture.
I always want to stay different	Yeroo hundumaa adda ta'ee turuu nan barbaada
That’s all I thought	Kana qofa natti fakkaate
You’re not going there.	Ati achi hin deemtu.
Not now, not when he needed her the most.	Amma miti, yeroo inni baay'ee ishee barbaadu miti.
They are one.	Isaan tokko.
I just didn't need a watch	Sa'aatii qofa na hin barbaachifne
I’m just there to help her.	Ani ishee gargaaruuf qofa achi jira.
I always do that	Yeroo hundumaa akkas nan godha
I need this stuff in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti wanti kun na barbaachisa
I can't believe my luck.	Carraa koo amanuu hin danda'u.
I can make a few suggestions	Yaada muraasa kennuu nan danda'a
Not really sure what to say	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu mirkanaa'aa miti
He didn’t want me here.	Asitti na hin barbaanne ture.
I wondered what this one was	Inni kun maali jedheen yaade
Sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko.
I mean, just looking at you	Si ilaalaa qofa jechuu kooti
Then, it would be the right time.	Sana booda, yeroo sirrii ta’a ture.
Not all of them together.	Hundi isaanii waliin miti.
I need to go now.	Amma deemuun na barbaachisa.
But nothing more about it.	Garuu kana caalaa waa'ee isaa hin jiru.
I knew why it happened.	Maaliif akka ta'e nan beeka ture.
We made a life together	Jireenya waliin hojjenne
I couldn’t see anything	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye
This person doesn’t.	Namni kun hin godhu.
We need to ask new questions.	Gaaffii haaraa gaafachuu qabna.
But this was not her idea of ​​a good time.	Garuu kun yaada isheen yeroo gaarii hin turre.
I hadn’t even seen him	Isa illee hin argine ture
This is not what he should be doing.	Kun waan inni gochuu qabu miti.
There just aren’t enough times for her to do that.	Yeroon isheen akkas gootu gahaa miti qofa.
That was something none of us wanted.	Sun waan nu keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne ture.
I can't tell you what	Maal sitti himuu hin danda'u
He didn't say it anymore.	Kana booda hin jedhe.
You were right about that.	Waa'ee sanaa sirrii turte.
I should never have told	Silaa gonkumaa himuu hin qabu ture
I’m pretty sure nothing came out the door.	Wanti balbala keessaa ba’e akka hin jirre mirkanaa’aa dha.
I didn't do much though	Ani garuu waan baay'ee hin hojjenne
I would have liked it.	Silaa natti tola ture.
I never wanted to be in this again	Kana booda kana keessa jiraachuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
I would never be her	Ani gonkumaa ishee hin ta'u ture
I'm so glad I found you	Si argachuu kootti baay'een gammade
I need you to do me a favor.	Tola akka naaf gootu na barbaachisa.
He should have known better than to do that	Silaa sana gochuu caalaa beekuu qaba ture
We are yours, yours alone.	Nuti kan keessan, kan keessan qofa.
I can't do enough	Ani gahaa ta'ee hojjechuu hin danda'u
I couldn't say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin dandeenye.
I really don’t know what to make of him.	Dhuguma maal akka isa gootu hin beeku.
He didn't understand this	Kana hin hubanne
Not just when you were little.	Yeroo xiqqoo turte qofa miti.
He should have done those things	Silaa wantoota sana gochuu qaba ture
It’s not just the road though.	Karaa qofa miti garuu.
He started walking again	Ammas deemuu jalqabe
I think this will work.	Kun ni hojjeta jedheen yaada.
Lots of light	Ifa baay'ee
I almost did these things	Wantoota kana hojjechuuf jedheen ture
You're not going.	Ati hin deemtu.
Probably not necessary.	Tarii hin barbaachisu.
You have to go.	Deemu qabda.
That's how it worked, most of the time.	Akkasitti hojjeta ture, yeroo baayyee.
He will do so today.	Har'a akkas ni godha.
I think that’s one thing	Sun waan tokko natti fakkaata
I love every bit of it	Xiqqoo isaa hunda nan jaalladha
You have to find answers there.	Achitti deebii argachuu qabda.
He was very happy.	Baay'ee gammade.
That was your moment.	Yeroon kee sun ture.
We did it two months ago.	Ji'a lama dura hojjenne.
I have been looking for this opportunity for a long time	Carraa kana yeroo dheeraaf barbaadaa ture
You can come then.	Yeroo sana dhufuu dandeessa.
They are in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jiru.
This seems to be true.	Kun dhugaa fakkaata.
They are in a bad way.	Karaa hamaa keessa jiru.
They know me very well.	Isaan baay'ee gaarii na beeku.
I hope this works.	Kun akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
But there may not be much time.	Garuu yeroon baay'ee jiraachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
This is not enough at all.	Kun tasumaa gahaa miti.
And yet there is still hope.	Ammas ammas abdiin jira.
He seemed very happy.	Inni baay'ee gammade fakkaata ture.
I didn’t think it was important	Barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
They still had work to do.	Ammallee hojii qabu turan.
I was home for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf mana ture
Maybe I can never do that	Tarii gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin danda'u ta'a
I should never have done it	Silaa gonkumaa gochuu hin qabu ture
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
I think there is no such thing	Waan akkasii hin jiru jedheen yaada
It hasn’t worked yet	Hanga ammaatti hin hojjenne
They still don’t have to do that.	Ammallee akkas gochuu hin qaban.
My work is my business.	Hojiin koo dhimma kooti.
It has only two names	Maqaa lama qofa qaba
I know that will never happen.	Yoomiyyuu akkas akka hin taane nan beeka.
I don't mean it.	Jechuu koo miti.
I am not one.	Ani tokko miti.
I knew I could never afford one.	Yoomiyyuu tokko bitachuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture.
I mean, he's not human.	Inni nama miti jechuu kooti.
Unlike everywhere else in the area.	Bakka naannoo sana jiru hunda irraa adda.
I can meet you there	Achitti wal arguu nan danda'a
That told you they had something.	Sun waan tokko akka qaban sitti hime.
What could be easier?.	Maaltu salphaa ta'uu danda'a?.
It’s so simple and great.	Akka malee salphaa fi guddaa dha.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
I wasn't yet someone who could do that.	Ani ammallee nama waan akkasii hojjechuu danda'u hin taane ture.
If only we all could.	Osoo hundi keenya dandeenyu.
I can help with that	Sana irratti gargaaruu nan danda'a
But this was something she wanted worse than me.	Garuu kun waan isheen na caalaa hamaa barbaaddu ture.
I never want to see him again	Kana booda gonkumaa isa arguu hin barbaadu
It must be a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu qaba.
My life, my.	Jireenya koo, koo.
I don't know what to say.	Maal akkan jedhu hin beeku.
I just like everything about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa qofa natti tola.
I can still help her	Ammallee ishee gargaaruu nan danda'a
There were just too many.	Baay'ee qofa turan.
He's looking at you	Si ilaalaa jira
I mean, they’re there.	Isaan achi jiru jechuu kooti.
But, now it could be worse.	Garuu, amma kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
There is only so much you can do to a house.	Mana tokko irratti gochuu dandeessu hamma kana qofa.
He was a great man.	Nama guddaa ture.
They’re just people.	Isaan namoota qofa.
No one here should know.	Namni as jiru beekuu hin qabu.
He did so many things for me.	Waan baay'ee naaf godhe.
I love my mother very much	Haadha koo baay'een jaalladha
This will be you.	Kun si ta'a.
I still don’t understand that	Ammallee sana naaf hin galle
I don't quite understand why	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti naaf hin galle
I know what is going to happen	Waan ta'uuf jiru nan beeka
But I wasn't sure.	Garuu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It’s not hers.	Kan ishee miti.
The interview just started	Gaaffii fi deebii amma jalqabe
This is not an accident.	Kun balaa miti.
A couple of things.	Waan lama lama.
Now I can see it's too late.	Amma yeroon isaa darbe ta'uu isaa arguu danda'a.
He might have thought.	Silaa yaade ta'a.
I say that much for him.	Hamma sana isaaf jedha.
I think you’ll love it	Ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
I like when they have so much time	Yeroo akkasitti yeroo baay'ee qaban natti tola
I wasn't sure if they were always like that though	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'uu isaanii garuu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
You must come with me, now, to my room.	Na waliin dhufuu qabda, amma, gara kutaa kootti.
Not bad really.	Hamaa miti dhuguma.
I don't know.	Hin beeku.
You wouldn’t be there.	Ati hin jirtu turte.
Independent if year.	Of danda'a yoo waggaa.
You are always somewhere.	Yeroo hundumaa bakka tokko jirta.
I will make them yours	Kan keessan isaan nan godha
Then he talked about his mother.	Sana booda waa'ee haadha isaa dubbate.
I’d really rather not eat that.	Dhuguma sana nyaachuu dhiisuu naaf wayya.
I love that.	Sana nan jaalladha.
I have questions about this before	Waa'ee kanaan dura gaaffii qaba
That’s not just here.	Sun as qofa miti.
It’s just inevitable.	Waan hin oolle qofa.
This is completely wrong.	Kun guutummaatti dogoggora.
It's better than that.	Caalaatti wayya.
I love you, you should know that	Si jaalladha, kana beekuu qabda
No one really knows.	Dhuguma namni beeku hin jiru.
I couldn't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
She had to see it.	Isheen arguu qabdi turte.
I didn’t want to repeat myself	Of irra deebi’uu hin barbaanne
Obviously he could never do that	Inni gonkumaa akkas gochuu akka hin dandeenye ifaadha
But we can’t stay here any longer.	Garuu kana booda as turuu hin dandeenyu.
I don’t have parents	Warra hin qabu
All of our work.	Hojii keenya hunda.
I like it very much	Baayyee natti tola
He spoke again.	Ammas dubbate.
Unique to us.	Nuuf kan adda ta'e.
I knew him so well.	Ani akka malee isa beeka ture.
I had no idea it was that good	Hangas gaarii ta'uu isaa yaada hin qabu ture
Yesterday she had everything she wanted at her disposal.	Kaleessa waan barbaaddu hunda harka ishee keessa qabdi turte.
I couldn’t do anything else	Waan biraa gochuu hin dandeenye
He wanted to.	Inni barbaade.
In my eyes that is absolutely right.	Ija kootti sun guutummaatti sirrii dha.
I was no longer looking at two people	Kana booda nama lama ilaalaa hin turre
Must do great schoolwork	Hojii mana barumsaa guddaa hojjechuu qaba
But they were just too big.	Garuu isaan baayyee guddaa qofa turan.
I didn't think it would be like that.	Akkas ta'a jedhee hin yaadne.
There were not many people there.	Achitti namni baay'ee hin turre.
I told him he was exactly right	Sirriitti sirrii akka ture itti hime
She was very good.	Isheen baayyee gaarii turte.
You are not real.	Ati dhugaa miti.
Now what could be more perfect.	Amma maaltu kana caalaa guutuu ta'uu danda'a.
It was part of him, not part of him.	Kutaa isaa ture malee kutaa isaa miti.
I always knew they had my dog	Yeroo hundumaa saree koo akka qaban nan beeka ture
He knows you through and through.	Inni karaa fi karaa si beeka.
Mass.	Hanga.
I knew it was a terrible mistake	Dogoggora hamaa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
They don’t seem any different.	Isaan garuu adda hin fakkaatu.
Neither of us were sure about it.	Lamaan keenyayyuu waa’ee kanaa mirkanaa’aa hin turre.
I think that’s right	Sun sirrii natti fakkaata
That’s not so bad.	Sun hangas hamaa miti.
So, this must be something else.	Kanaaf, kun waan biraa ta’uu qaba.
You have no problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoo hin qabdu.
That wasn’t always the case	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre
That's just the way it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qabu qofa.
It didn’t matter anymore	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu ture
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
Much taller than you	Si caalaa baayyee dheeraa
I always know more about you	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee kee caalaatti beeka
Love her mother.	Haadha ishee jaalladhu.
But maybe they should have.	Tarii garuu qabaachuu qabu ta'a.
You just have to believe in it.	Itti amanuu qofa qabda.
But that's not what this is about.	Garuu kun waa'ee kanaa miti.
My feelings and my thoughts.	Miira koo fi yaada koo.
I know you will always be there for me	Yeroo hundumaa akka naaf jirtu nan beeka
He was a great man.	Nama guddaa ture.
I wonder if anyone is there	Namni achi jiraa jedheen yaada
Sorry about that, everyone.	Dhiifama waa'ee sanaa, hunda.
I didn't think she was qualified	Isheen ga'umsa waan qabdu natti hin fakkaatu ture
I rarely do it.	Ani yeroo muraasaaf nan godha.
He was something different.	Inni waan adda ta'ee ture.
You don't like anyone else.	Kan biraa hin jaallattu.
Tell him about it.	Itti himi.
That's a pretty good feeling, you know.	Sun miira baayyee gaarii dha, beekta.
Who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e.
You should have seen that coming.	Sun dhufuu isaa arguu qabda turte.
I couldn’t help but believe them	Isaan amanuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
Not before that afternoon.	Waaree booda sana dura miti.
He was in really bad shape	Dhuguma haala hamaa keessa ture
I didn't know much more	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee hin beeku ture
But that’s not the case anymore.	Garuu kana booda akkas miti.
They certainly aren’t.	Isaan akka hin taane beekamaadha.
She hadn’t been there.	Isheen hin turre turte.
He wasn’t there.	Inni hin turre.
I don't want to talk about them.	Waa'ee isaanii dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
They like it, you don’t.	Isaan ni jaallattu, ati hin jaallattu.
He needs a car.	Konkolaataa barbaada.
No one else saw it.	Namni biraa arge hin jiru.
I wasn't good at much of it.	Ani baay'ee irratti ga'umsa hin qabu ture.
I can't eat anything	Homaa nyaachuu hin danda'u
I know he loves me very much	Baay'ee akka na jaallatu nan beeka
This one time.	Yeroo tokko kana.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I can't go.	Ani deemuu hin danda'u.
I wouldn’t want to do this if it weren’t for you	Osoo ati hin taane kana gochuu hin barbaadu ture
That is the task before us.	Hojiin nu dura jiru kanuma.
But you don’t have to live without it.	Garuu isa malee jiraachuu hin qabdu.
I don't know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku.
We disagreed on some things.	Wantoota tokko tokko irratti walii hin galle.
I want to do something for you	Waan tokko siif gochuu barbaada
Maybe not that one.	Tarii isa sana miti.
We are just human beings.	Nuti nama qofa.
You need to do something else.	Waan biraa gochuun si barbaachisa.
I can do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu nan danda'a.
I doubt you need to do anything.	Waan tokko gochuun akka si barbaachisu nan shakka.
It may not be anything.	Homaa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
I can see her.	Ishee arguu nan danda'a.
I knew it was going to be bad	Hamaa akka ta'u nan beeka ture
I can't, really.	Hin danda'u, dhuguma.
I have to go.	Ani deemuu qaba.
We hadn't done much for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf waan baay'ee hin hojjenne turre.
I wanted to do something different	Waan adda taʼe hojjechuu barbaade
Sometimes that’s not the case.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas miti.
They’re more independent.	Caalaatti of danda’u.
You know what that sounds like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu beekta.
I had no idea this would happen	Kun akka ta'u yaada hin qabu ture
I know you can help me	Na gargaaruu akka dandeessu nan beeka
No one wants it.	Namni barbaadu hin jiru.
The two are similar.	Lamaan wal fakkaatu.
Not that there will be one .	Tokko ni jiraata jechuu miti .
This is no question.	Kun gaaffii hin qabu.
They are good people.	Namoota gaarii dha.
I wanted what she had.	Waan isheen qabdu barbaade.
I would love some help.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko nan jaalladha.
Then tell him exactly what to do.	Sana booda maal akka godhu sirriitti itti himi.
I will probably do this often.	Yeroo baayyee kana gochuun koo hin oolu.
Very good condition.	Haala baayyee gaarii.
He could have done it.	Silaa gochuu danda'a ture.
There must be a lot of people in here.	As keessa namoonni baay'een jiraachuu qabu.
That she wasn’t really interested in him.	Dhuguma isaaf fedhii akka hin qabne.
I hadn’t seen it yet	Hanga ammaatti hin argine ture
He looked at her but didn’t see her.	Ishee ilaale malee ishee hin argine.
I could not have done this	Silaa kana gochuu hin danda'u ture
I don’t have a feeling.	Miira hin qabu.
Great job, again.	Hojii guddaa, ammas.
I know exactly where he was	Bakka inni ture sirriitti beeka
I want to know them.	Isaan beekuu barbaada.
That can't be right.	Sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
Maybe someone was there.	Tarii namni tokko achi ture ta'a.
These are not our problems.	Isaan kun rakkoo keenya miti.
All my life, I’ve been there.	Jireenya koo guutuu, achi ture.
I saw nothing at all	Tasumaa homaa hin argine
There was something he had to tell.	Waan himuu qabu tokko ture.
It’s so obvious.	Akkas ifaadha.
I was nothing to these people	Ani namoota kanaaf homaa hin turre
It wasn’t just a duty.	Dirqama qofa hin turre.
They are already becoming our reality.	Duruu dhugaa keenya ta'aa jiru.
Except for something important.	Waan barbaachisaa tokko malee.
That’s what’s going on there now.	Amma achi deemaa jiru kanuma.
I absolutely love it though.	Ani garuu guutummaatti nan jaalladha.
He never knew who was watching.	Eenyu akka ilaalaa jiru gonkumaa hin beekne.
So please take a look.	Kanaaf mee ilaalaa.
He is almost unconscious	Of hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama
That is.	Sun ...dha.
I had nothing to say to her	Waan isheen jedhu hin qabu ture
You two wait here.	Isin lamaan as eegaa.
He knew she would.	Akka isheen gootu beeka ture.
He never told the truth	Yeroo tokkollee dhugaa hin dubbanne
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
I wondered where he was	Eessa jira jedheen yaade
He was my favorite man.	Inni nama ani jaalladhu ture.
It was really obvious.	Dhuguma ifa ture.
It was necessary to do this.	Kana gochuun barbaachisaa ture.
I mean, it was a little day	Guyyaa xiqqoo tokko ture jechuu kooti
That’s about a third of my life.	Sun gara harka sadii jireenya kooti.
A bit of luck, that.	Xiqqoo carraa, sana.
He was very good at it.	Baay'ee itti ga'umsa qaba ture.
I love your photos	Suuraa keessan baay'een jaalladha
It had to be a picture.	Suuraa ta'uu qaba ture.
You don’t think about it.	Ati itti hin yaaddu.
Not everyone knew about it.	Namni hundi waa'ee kanaa hin beeku ture.
That works well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Clearly, that is no longer the case.	Kana booda akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
It was easier to do than they expected.	Kan isaan eegaa turan caalaa gochuun salphaa ture.
He knew everybody.	Nama hunda beeka ture.
Two hours later on the same person.	Sa'aatii lama booda nama tokko irratti.
I told him he was completely joking	Guutummaatti qoosaa akka jiru itti hime
I can't leave these people	Namoota kana dhiisuu hin danda'u
We are with them.	Isaan waliin jirra.
Nothing else seemed too important.	Wanti biraa garmalee barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu ture.
No past, no future.	Kan darbe hin jiru, kan dhufu hin jiru.
They will want their room.	Isaan kutaa isaanii ni barbaadu.
It didn’t last long	Yeroo dheeraaf hin turre
This is very good.	Kun baayyee gaarii dha.
I pretty much know who he was	Eenyu akka ture baay'een beeka
You are in danger.	Balaa keessa jirta.
She didn’t know how to know this.	Kana akkamitti akka beektu hin beektu turte.
Who he was.	Inni eenyu akka ture.
Hope to see you soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti wal arguu akka dandeenyu abdii qabna.
I can see you tomorrow morning	Boru ganama si arguu nan danda'a
But it was a long time ago.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Now it's mine.	Amma kan kooti.
I don't know what he's doing.	Waan hojjetu hin beeku.
I went out like it was my job	Ani akka waan hojii kootti ba'e
I can just see them on the road	Karaa irra qofa isaan arguu nan danda'a
I still won’t tell you	Ammallee sitti hin himu
I love that sort of thing.	Waan akkasii nan jaalladha.
It was just her place	Bakka ishee qofa ture
None wanted to go, but we had to go.	Deemuu barbaadu tokkollee hin turre, garuu deemuu qabna turre.
I didn’t really know what he was talking about.	Waan inni jedhu dhuguma hin beeku ture.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
Great in your work.	Hojii keessan keessatti guddaa dha.
It looked worse than usual	Yeroo biraa caalaa hamaa fakkaata ture
I want this.	Ani kana barbaada.
Now he is in that situation	Amma haala sana keessa jira
Which he did.	Kan inni godhe.
I don't think so	Akkas miti jedheen yaada
I knew nothing about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture.
Life after life after life.	Jireenya booda jireenya booda.
There was nothing similar.	Wanti wal fakkaatu hin turre.
But it matters to us.	Garuu nuuf dhimma qaba.
There is nothing.	Homaa hin jiru.
I mean, that wasn’t just me	Sun ana qofa hin turre jechuu kooti
I think he knows that	Kana waan beeku natti fakkaata
No one needs to know.	Namni beekuu hin barbaachisu.
There was nothing she could do.	Wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
I can't believe the time went by so quickly	Yeroon akkas dafee darbe jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
But tonight, it was different.	Garuu halkan kana, adda ture.
It was just a suggestion	Yaada kennuu qofa ture
It was in their eyes.	Ija isaanii keessa ture.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
I shouldn't have been like that	Ani akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture
The book of the day.	Kitaaba guyyaa.
That was often the case.	Yeroo baayyee akkas ture.
I mean, none of us live like that	Akkasitti jiraachuu jechuu kooti, ​​nu keessaa tokkollee miti
I think he should know	Beekuu qaba jedheen yaada
It was as simple as that.	Akkuma sanaa salphaa ture.
Who did nothing.	Kan homaa hin goone.
So far so good.	Hanga ammaatti akkas gaarii.
Didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beekne.
I was good at walking	Ani deemuu irratti ga'umsa qaba ture
I thought it was great	Guddaa natti fakkaate
But these people.	Garuu namoonni kun.
It can even be dangerous.	Balaa illee taʼuu dandaʼa.
I am very good.	Ani baayyee gaarii dha.
There are no two.	Lama hin jiru.
I wanted to see him, today	Isa arguu barbaade, har'a
It was more than filling	Guutuu caalaa ture
I have my affairs in my hands	Dhimma koo harka kootti qaba
But he did not know what it was	Maal akka taʼe garuu hin beeku ture
It worked so well.	Akka malee hojjete.
Then one went up.	Sana booda tokko ol ba'e.
All she had to do was get it.	Wanti isheen gochuu qabdu argachuu qofa ture.
But maybe it won't work.	Tarii garuu hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
That’s definitely not a problem.	Sun rakkoo akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
He knew it.	Inni ni beeka ture.
This is not a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa miti.
Maybe in an hour, maybe in a day, but soon.	Tarii sa'aatii tokko booda, tarii guyyaa tokko booda, garuu yeroo dhiyootti.
I know they were trying to help	Gargaaruuf yaalaa akka turan nan beeka
It didn’t work that way	Akkasitti hin hojjenne
I would never do that to her	Ani gonkumaa akkas ishee hin godhu ture
I think about it all the time	Yeroo hunda itti yaada
You don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beektu.
I need her help with my mom	Haadha koo wajjin gargaarsa isheen na barbaachisa
He really had his passion at that point	Dhuguma yeroo sanatti fedhii isaa qaba ture
The feel of his voice.	Miira sagalee isaa.
I didn’t know that fact before	Dhugaa sana kanaan dura hin beeku ture
It looked very different from what we have today.	Kan har'a qabnu irraa baayyee adda fakkaata ture.
I can't talk about it at all	Waa'ee isaa tasumaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
He may already have.	Duraan qabaachuu danda'a.
But I couldn't believe it	Ani garuu amanuu hin dandeenye
He seemed to enjoy it very much	Baay'ee waan itti gammade fakkaata ture
Same language, of course.	Afaan wal fakkaatu, beekamaadha.
It could be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
What is it.	Maal isa.
I want to know what he’s doing	Maal akka hojjetu beekuu barbaada
But it didn’t happen that way.	Garuu akkas hin taane.
The one that's great.	Kan guddaa ta'e.
He started doing that again	Ammas akkas gochuu jalqabe
I can’t seem to help it	Ani waanan gargaaruu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
I can't say exactly when it started	Yoom akka jalqabe sirriitti dubbachuu hin danda'u
I hadn't thought about that idea enough	Yaada sana gahaa ta'ee hin yaadne ture
Better than the old days.	Bara durii caalaa gaarii dha.
Great day and great week!	Guyyaa guddaa fi torban guddaa!
In the old days she would have.	Bara durii silaa qabdi turte.
She doesn't care.	Isheen dhimma hin qabdu.
But he couldn't tell.	Garuu beekuu hin dandeenye.
They weren’t that good.	Isaan hangas gaarii hin turre.
Sometimes it works.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta.
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
He is truly my father.	Dhuguma abbaa kooti.
But, who knows.	Garuu, eenyutu beeka.
I can't get that.	Ani sana argachuu hin danda'u.
I couldn’t see any better.	Kana caalaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t really know how to do that	Dhuguma akkas gochuuf hin beeku ture
If it doesn't, it won't.	Yoo hin taane hin ta'u.
I will.	Ani nan.
I can't leave them	Isaan dhiisuu hin danda'u
That everything came from nothing.	Wanti hundi homaa irraa akka dhufe.
You are in serious trouble.	Rakkoo hamaa keessa jirta.
I wondered where I was going	Eessa akkan deemu yaade
Perhaps you will not go at all.	Tarii tasumaa hin deemtu taʼa.
I was very happy for him	Isaaf baay'een gammade
He wanted to come back here.	Asitti deebi'uu barbaade.
I wanted to do this and repeat	Kana hojjechuu fi irra deebi'uu barbaade
I hadn't realized it was this week.	Torban kana akka ta'e hin hubanne ture.
But, it will not be perfect, ever.	Garuu, guutuu hin ta'u, yoomiyyuu.
It does the job for you	Hojii sana siif hojjeta
I have no idea what it could be	Maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu
It must be there.	Achitti ta'uu qaba.
But it’s still not enough.	Garuu ammallee gahaa miti.
This is what happens now.	Amma kan ta'u kana.
Then you can fill it out.	Sana booda guutuu dandeessa.
No one was there anymore.	Kana booda namni achi hin turre.
It’s extremely dangerous.	Garmalee balaa qaba.
I didn’t want the money.	Ani qarshii hin barbaanne.
You are not in the imagination.	Ati yaada keessa hin jirtu.
I wasn't sure what the timing was.	Yeroon sun maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
They were his.	Kan isaa turan.
I’ve been like that my whole life	Jireenya koo guutuu akkas ture
I really hope he likes it	Dhuguma akka inni jaallatu abdiin qaba
You have to know people.	Namoota beekuu qabda.
I probably don't have it	Ani tarii hin qabu
But then he needed new things.	Sana booda garuu wantoota haaraa isa barbaachisa ture.
That one is me.	Inni sun ana.
Maybe you won't.	Tarii hin gootu ta'a.
But one thing is different.	Garuu wanti tokko adda.
I know exactly what it’s like	Maal akka fakkaatu sirriitti beeka
They can be the same thing.	Isaan waan tokko ta’uu danda’u.
Not very long.	Baayyee dheeraa miti.
I think she would be great	Isheen guddaa ta'a jedheen yaada
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
It just can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
I just can't seem to find the right one	Kan sirrii ta'e argachuu qofa waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
It was just as he said.	Akkuma jedhe ture.
He asked for help.	Gargaarsa gaafate.
I looked at him wondering what was going on	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen isa ilaale
I know where you are	Bakka jirtu nan beeka
Unless, unless, unless.	Yoo malee, yoo ta'e malee, yoo ta'e malee.
I like that about her.	Waa'ee ishee akkas natti tola.
But now it is clear to me.	Garuu amma naaf ifaadha.
I think we didn't really talk about it	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa hin dubbanne jedheen yaada
I couldn’t believe my luck.	Carraa koo amanuu hin dandeenye.
He wanted nothing.	Inni homaa barbaade.
Until recently, no one ever did	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti namni akkas godhe hin beeku
Time to get back on track.	Yeroon karaa irra deebi'uu.
But that would be a big mistake.	Garuu sun dogoggora guddaa ta'a.
He seemed to be real.	Inni waan dhugaa ture fakkaata ture.
I knew something would happen	Waan tokko akka ta'u nan beeka ture
I still don’t know what to do.	Ammallee maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I think he’s still waiting	Ammas eegaa jira jedheen yaada
I don't understand why	Maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle
There is a problem today.	Har'a rakkoon jira.
Been in here a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa as keessa ture.
In this case, I couldn’t do that.	Haala kana keessatti akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I mean, it's not like that	Akkas miti jechuu kooti
But this did not last long.	Garuu kun yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I wanted to be together with her	Ishee waliin waliin ta'uu barbaade
That wasn't something that happened very often.	Sun waan yeroo baay'ee ta'u hin turre.
I always wanted to go	Yeroo hundumaa deemuu nan barbaada ture
But she was making fun of my question.	Garuu gaaffii koo qoosaa turte.
I should have found her, she said	Silaa ishee argachuu qaba ture jette
I could totally do this	Guutummaatti kana gochuu nan danda'a ture
You should find it very easy.	Baayyee salphaa ta'ee argachuu qabda.
We had enough of us.	Nu gahaa qabna turre.
It has such a great sense of past.	Miira guddaa akkasii kan darbe qaba.
I wasn’t in the room	Ani kutaa sana keessa hin turre
He knew he had to tell the truth.	Dhugaa dubbachuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
It was exactly the same.	Sirriitti wal fakkaata ture.
I could stay in there all day	Guyyaa guutuu achi keessa turuu nan danda'a ture
I have an opinion about you too	Anis waa'ee kee yaada qaba
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
That night was just night.	Halkan sun halkan qofa ture.
There was no time before.	Yeroon dura hin turre.
I couldn't have done it alone	Silaa kophaa koo hojjechuu hin danda'u ture
She would never think of them again.	Kana booda gonkumaa isaan hin yaaddu turte.
I thought you might be.	Ati ta'uu dandeessa jedheen yaade.
And I thought that was you here	Anis asitti sun si ta'uu kee natti fakkaate
I can't say I would have known anything else	Silaa waan biraa beeka jechuu hin danda'u
It requires a clear answer	Deebii ifa ta'e barbaada
He loved to talk about himself.	Waa'ee ofii isaa dubbachuu ni jaallata ture.
I still loved my children.	Ammallee ijoollee koo nan jaalladha ture.
Usually this was me.	Yeroo baayyee kun ana ture.
I was all of those things	Ani wantoota sana hunda ture
I love this girl so much	Intala kana baay'een jaalladha
It needs to be done more.	Caalaatti hojjechuu barbaachisa.
No one wanted them.	Namni isaan barbaade hin jiru.
So he didn't say anything.	Kanaaf homaa hin dubbanne.
But he didn't say anything.	Garuu homaa hin dubbanne.
He knew better.	Inni caalaatti beeka ture.
More people would know about it.	Silaa namoonni baay'een waa'ee isaa ni beeku.
I thought that was going too far	Sun garmalee waan deemu natti fakkaate
I didn’t want to live in the present anymore	Kana booda yeroo ammaa keessa jiraachuu hin barbaanne
He wants the truth.	Dhugaa barbaada.
I don’t have that problem.	Rakkoo sana hin qabu.
I want to play with you	Si waliin taphachuu barbaada
I knew it wasn’t true	Dhugaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I can't ask about that yet	Waa'ee sanaa hanga ammaatti gaafachuu hin danda'u
This is really nothing new.	Kun dhuguma waan haaraa miti.
I didn’t know she would do that	Ani garuu akkas akka gootu hin beeku ture
He wasn’t in the mood	Miira keessa hin turre
I didn't say anything.	Ani homaa hin dubbanne.
They want to know more.	Caalaatti beekuu barbaadu.
He's doing fine.	Inni gaarii hojjechaa jira.
Now they want to stay at work.	Amma hojii irra turuu barbaadu.
I knew something wasn’t right now	Waan tokko amma sirrii akka hin taane nan beeka ture
A lot of people were watching.	Namoonni baay'een ilaalaa turan.
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
I always told him great work	Yeroo hunda hojii guddaa itti hime
Just thoughts that come and go.	Yaada dhufuu fi deemu qofa.
Please find her.	Mee ishee barbaadaa.
I haven't told him yet	Ammallee itti hin himne
A lot of people are working on it.	Namoonni baay'een irratti hojjechaa jiru.
He wasn’t outside long.	Yeroo dheeraa ala hin turre.
New clothes.	Uffata haaraa.
I have a few questions though	Gaaffii muraasa qaba garuu
Now it’s just the two of them.	Amma isaan lamaan qofa.
I was there with you	Si waliin achi ture
I really don’t need it	Dhuguma na hin barbaachisu
I don’t know if you can do that.	Akkas gochuu dandeessu hin beeku.
People needed to know what he saw.	Namoonni waan inni arge beekuu qabu turan.
I knew it had to happen	Ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture
I haven’t done anything wrong so far.	Hanga ammaatti waan hamaa hin hojjenne.
What could go wrong!.	Maaltu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a!.
Maybe he's right.	Tarii sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
It didn’t happen in real life.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti hin taane.
But he couldn't do it.	Garuu gochuu hin dandeenye.
I need a little help	Gargaarsa xiqqoo na barbaachisa
It looked absolutely terrible.	Guutummaatti hamaa fakkaata ture.
I can no longer give myself to him	Kana booda ofii koo isaaf kennuu hin danda'u
And I did the same thing.	Anis akkas godhe.
I would never have thought of it	Silaa gonkumaa hin yaadu ture
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
We have it.	Nuti adda.
I was sure it was true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa ture
Maybe this is the reason.	Tarii sababni kun ta'uu danda'a.
That was it.	Sana ture.
It was that simple.	Akkas salphaa ture.
I didn’t know you had to have one	Tokko qabaachuu akka qabdu hin beeku ture
They are the ones.	Isaan sun isa.
It wasn't going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin turre.
They have everything they need.	Waan isaan barbaachisu hunda qabu.
I don't know what's going on about this.	Waa'ee kanaa maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
But everything about this year was different.	Garuu waa'ee bara kanaa wanti hundi adda ture.
We are nothing like that.	Nuti homaa akkas miti.
It didn’t look so good now.	Amma akkas gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
He needs food.	Nyaata barbaada.
I really like this guy here	Gurbaa kana asitti baay'een jaalladha
I was just a girl.	Ani intala qofa ture.
I know she was doing something to her	Waan tokko ishee irratti gochaa akka turte nan beeka
So far, no one has looked at me.	Hanga ammaatti namni na ilaale hin jiru.
Maybe we should do it.	Tarii nuti gochuu qabna.
I want to say.	Jechuun barbaada.
I have been waiting for this for a long time	Kana yeroo dheeraaf eegaa ture
A hopeful gleam came into her eyes	Ifa abdii qabu tokko ija ishee keessa dhufe
I will do that soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti akkas nan godha.
I can never do duty	Ani gonkumaa dirqama hojjechuu hin danda'u
There was no work.	Hojiin hin turre.
I know how you can be	Akkamitti akka ta'uu dandeessu nan beeka
He needs to play more	Kana caalaa taphachuu qaba
Two of them are.	Isaan keessaa lama.
I go much further than that.	Kana caalaa baay'een deema.
He knew it wasn’t.	Akka hin taane beeka ture.
I still have no answer	Ammallee deebii hin qabu
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
It was really really nice.	Dhuguma dhuguma namatti tola ture.
It has a condition.	Haala qaba.
She's probably my daughter.	Isheen intala koo ta'uu hin oolu.
But then he was gone.	Sana booda garuu hin jiru ture.
He thought he knew what that could be about.	Sun waa'ee maal ta'uu akka danda'u waan beeku itti fakkaate.
I am glad I did this	Kana gochuu kootti gammadeera
. . . .	.
None of this should happen.	Kun tokkollee ta’uu hin qabu.
Not sure if this is correct.	Kun sirrii ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
How can you tell.	Akkamitti himuu dandeessa.
I just can't right now	Yeroo ammaa kana qofa hin danda'u
He had already barely lived up to it.	Inni duruu jireenya isaa guutuu hin dandeenye ture.
I know he is, him and his wife	Inni akka ta'e nan beeka, inni fi haadha manaa isaa
It can be a problem though.	Rakkoo ta'uu danda'a garuu.
He can't be that dangerous.	Inni balaa hamma kanaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Just like yours.	Akkuma kan keessan.
That was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture.
He doesn't know me.	Na hin beeku.
But she couldn't.	Garuu hin dandeenye turte.
He wants you.	Si barbaada.
I really hoped it would	Dhuguma akka ta'u abdiin qaba ture
I think that’s what he meant	Kana jechuu barbaade natti fakkaata
It should have happened a long time ago.	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura ta'uu qaba ture.
I knew there was no hope for me	Abdiin naaf akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
It didn’t do well with him	Isa irratti gaarii hin hojjenne
She will have to.	Isheen dirqama ta'a.
I wonder where they are	Eessa jiru jedheen yaada
This is probably not the right way.	Kun tarii karaa sirrii ta'e miti.
I didn't realize it was that bad	Akkas hamaa akka ta'e hin hubanne
Not good enough.	Gaarii gahaa miti.
He had no one but them.	Isaan malee nama biraa hin qabu ture.
You don't know what this is going to be.	Kun maal akka ta'u hin beektu.
No one can do that.	Namni akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
People see more and do better.	Namoonni caalaatti arguu fi caalaatti hojjetu.
I was very happy that week though	Torban sana garuu baay'een gammade
They love me.	Na jaallatu.
I really don’t know how to do it.	Ani dhuguma akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku.
It was quick.	Dafee ture.
But he knew a lot.	Garuu baay'ee beeka ture.
There must be a reason.	Sababni jiraachuu qaba.
No one knows this better than you.	Kana si caalaa namni beeku hin jiru.
He was a boy.	Gurbaa ture.
It should have been more obvious.	Silaa caalaatti ifa ta'uu qaba ture.
Perhaps the	Tarii kan .
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
He’s on to something.	Inni waan tokko irra jira.
But she wasn't.	Isheen garuu hin turre.
I certainly have.	Ani akkan qabu beekamaadha.
He looked at the clock again	Ammas sa'aatii ilaale
No one like you has a life.	Namni akka kee jireenya hin qabu.
I wasn't sure what would happen after that	Sana booda maaltu akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre
He has one like him.	Tokko akka isaa qaba.
It was a bad year.	Bara hamaa ture.
He just can't do it.	Inni qofa gochuu hin danda'u.
I think it works a little bit on this	Kana irratti xiqqoo hojjeta jedheen yaada
But that wasn’t the case here.	Garuu asitti akkas hin turre.
We just knew we had to do this.	Kana gochuu akka qabnu qofa beekne.
It just has to be your passion	Fedhii kee qofa ta'uu qaba
He was inside me now.	Inni amma na keessa ture.
Maybe you are.	Tarii ati jirtu ta'a.
I want you to do me a favor	Tola akka naaf gootu nan barbaada
This is certainly not true.	Kun dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I still have a lot to do	Ammallee waanan hojjechuu qabu baayʼee qaba
It’s really really good.	Dhuguma dhuguma gaarii dha.
I couldn’t say that stuff	Waan sana dubbachuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t know what else to say	Kan biraa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
What would they have done.	Silaa maal godhu turan.
I wonder why this happens.	Kun maaliif ta'a jedheen yaada.
I never wanted to be that person	Nama akkasii ta'uu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
It never goes any further.	Kana caalaa gonkumaa hin deemu.
I wanted it to be simple.	Salphaa akka ta'u barbaade.
That wouldn't happen anymore.	Silaa kana booda sun hin ta'u ture.
That’s just how it works.	Akkasitti qofa hojjeta.
With everyone different	Nama adda ta'e hunda waliin
We did everything on time.	Waan hunda yeroon hojjenne.
It doesn’t matter, we’re here.	Homaa hin qabu, as jirra.
I can't stay home today	Har'a mana turuu hin danda'u
She's the only one.	Isheen qofa.
I think you have good language	Afaan gaarii qabda jedheen yaada
I was very much like that.	Ani baay'ee akkas ture.
Now, this isn’t everyone, obviously.	Amma, kun nama hunda miti, ifaadha.
Better than good, really.	Gaarii caalaa gaarii dha, dhuguma.
I think it's good.	Gaarii natti fakkaata.
I want a mother like that	Haadha akkasii barbaada
I knew what had happened	Waan ta'e nan beeka ture
But it wouldn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu ture.
I go to my work	Hojii kootti nan deema
I hadn’t seen her like that	Ani akkasitti ishee hin argine ture
It’s really good.	Dhuguma gaarii dha.
She was so very special.	Isheen akkas baayyee adda turte.
It was real life.	Jireenya dhugaa ture.
I was still the only person around	Ammas nama naannoo sana jiru ana qofa ture
I am certainly not.	Ani akkan hin taane beekamaadha.
Such a great place.	Bakka guddaa akkasii.
More, perhaps.	Caalaatti, tarii.
They still loved her.	Ammas ishee jaallatu turan.
If it works, great.	Yoo hojjete guddaa.
It is doing very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jira.
I can't seem to find it	Argachuu waanan hin dandeenye fakkaata
He worked all day.	Guyyaa guutuu hojjete.
I didn't know what to do about that.	Waa'ee sanaa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
I just have to believe it	Ani amanuu qofa qaba
I knew he enjoyed it	Akka itti gammade nan beeka ture
I couldn't see very well	Baay'ee gaarii arguu hin dandeenye
I will never tell	Yoomiyyuu hin himu
He had no one for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf nama hin qabu ture.
She needs to be on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra deemuu qabdi.
I need to do this alone	Kana kophaa koo gochuun na barbaachisa
People who didn’t understand	Namoota hin hubanne
This wasn’t the case.	Kun hin turre.
He had all the questions everyone would	Gaaffii namni hundi godhu hunda qaba ture
Time requires space.	Yeroon bakka barbaada.
I'm sorry, but that's how it is	Dhiifama garuu akkas ta'a
I thought it would be pretty great.	Baayyee guddaa ta'a jedheen yaade.
I was more than happy	Caalaatti gammadeera
All of this.	Kana hunda.
You can't do it anymore.	Kana booda hin dandeessu.
This is just one.	Kun tokko qofa.
I mean, it wasn’t bad at all	Tasumaa hamaa hin turre jechuu kooti
No one said that, but it sure was.	Namni akkas jedhe hin jiru, garuu mirkanaa'aa ture.
I saw that three had the same room	Sadii kutaa tokko akka qaban arge
I'm not good enough.	Ani gaarii miti.
But that shouldn't be the case.	Garuu sun ta'uu hin qabu.
He looked over the situation.	Haala jiru irra ilaale.
But why wait.	Garuu maaliif eegaa.
I'm still working on it.	Ammas itti hojjechaa jira.
We are all one we are.	Hundi keenya tokko nuti.
You’re not the only one.	Si qofa miti.
Now I knew who he was	Amma eenyu akka ta'e nan beeka ture
I don’t know where it’s going.	Eessa akka deemu hin beeku.
It was a really bad time	Dhuguma yeroo hamaa ture
But they weren’t interested.	Garuu fedhii hin qaban turan.
I thought he would be a good husband for you	Abbaa manaa gaarii siif ta'a jedheen yaade
He was no longer qualified	Kana booda ga'umsa hin qabu ture
I would never have done that.	Silaa gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
I should probably go	Ani tarii deemuu qaba
Not another one.	Kan biraa miti.
Nobody took that.	Sana namni fudhate hin jiru.
It didn't look like anyone could be doing it.	Namni tokkollee hojjechaa jiraachuu waan danda'u hin fakkaatu ture.
A little unclear from your question.	Gaaffii keessan irraa xiqqoo ifa miti.
I didn’t need to say that.	Akkas jechuun na hin barbaachifne.
I couldn’t ask for anything more.	Kana caalaa waan gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
I need you to do that.	Akkas akka gootu na barbaachisa.
It's almost like he wants it	Akka inni barbaadu jechuun ni danda'ama
You know what happens then.	Yeroo sanatti maal akka ta'u ni beekta.
I never wanted to be one.	Ani gonkumaa tokko ta'uu hin barbaanne.
Even at night.	Halkan illee.
You did it.	Ati goote.
That’s your job.	Hojiin kee kanuma.
That is, the.	Kana jechuun.
Or was it two?.	Moo lama ture?.
I would have done this.	Silaa kana nan godha ture.
You know, he lives a life.	Beektaa jireenya jiraata.
It was a good school.	Mana barumsaa gaarii ture.
I had him.	Ani isa qaba ture.
You know this now.	Kana amma beekta.
Going in a few hours.	Sa'aatii muraasa booda deemaa jira.
You might even be able to make them.	Isaan hojjechuu illee ni dandeessa taʼa.
He has no father	Abbaa hin qabu
This is life.	Kun jireenya.
I am one of those people.	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko.
He wasn't so sure about himself.	Waa'ee ofii isaa hangas mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I wanted to go alone	Kophaa koo deemuu barbaade
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I wanted to be myself.	Ani ofii koo ta'uu barbaade.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
Not long to go now.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre amma deemuuf.
He had some questions.	Gaaffii tokko tokko qaba ture.
About the old days.	Waa'ee bara durii.
I don’t have a new book.	Kitaaba haaraa hin qabu.
That’s what you want.	Kan ati barbaaddu kanuma.
See if it's true or not.	Dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa ilaalaa.
I just didn't have much time to think about it	Ani garuu yeroo baay'ee itti yaadu hin qabu ture
He knew what she was.	Maal akka taate beeka ture.
I could recognize myself in some things	Wantoota tokko tokko keessatti of beekuu nan dandaʼa ture
I should never have gone	Silaa gonkumaa deemuu hin qabu ture
I just want to be smart.	Beeka ta'uu qofa barbaada.
It’s a book.	Kitaaba dha.
There is no other opportunity.	Carraan biraa hin jiru.
I just can't believe all this, that's all	Kana hunda qofa amanuu hin danda'u, kana qofa
But it was nothing.	Garuu homaa hin turre.
I have no idea what to say.	Maal akka jedhu yaada hin qabu.
I didn’t understand, but that was okay	Naaf hin galle, garuu sun homaa ture
I don't have much time	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabu
I really should go home	Dhuguma gara manaatti deebi'uu qaba
Of course, there are problems.	Rakkoon akka jiru beekamaadha.
It was going to be her big comeback.	Deebi'uu ishee guddaa ta'uuf ture.
I cannot do this without light	Ifa malee kana gochuu hin danda'u
I have no real friends	Hiriyyoota dhugaa hin qabu
I didn't know what that meant either	Anis sun maal jechuu akka taʼe hin beeku ture
I cannot do that to my parents	Warra koo irratti akkas gochuu hin dandaʼu
They have their own issues.	Dhimma isaanii qabu.
I think that is possible	Sun ni danda'ama jedheen yaada
Savage.	Hamaa.
He thought too much of himself	Garmalee ofitti yaade
He said nothing to his mother.	Haadha isaatiin homaa hin dubbanne.
He was always a teacher	Yeroo hundumaa barsiisaa ture
Which is the date in question.	Kan guyyaa gaaffii keessa jiru.
This is becoming a bigger and bigger issue.	Kun dhimma guddaa fi guddaa ta’aa jira.
We agreed.	Walii galle.
I couldn’t live with that.	Sana waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
This one was my job.	Inni kun hojii koo ture.
I just can't do this	Ani kana gochuu qofa hin danda'u
I did that to myself	Anis akkas ofitti godhe
I hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
But he is right.	Inni garuu sirrii dha.
Said.	Jedhe.
He is the same age as me.	Umuriin isaa akkuma kooti.
It was a simple question.	Gaaffii salphaa ture.
A few days later we were fine.	Guyyaa muraasa booda gaarii turre.
I still have bad days and good days	Ammallee guyyaa hamaa fi guyyaa gaarii qaba
You can never be.	Gonkumaa ta'uu hin dandeessu.
He said he desperately needed the money.	Maallaqa kana akka malee akka barbaadu dubbateera.
I knew nothing about them	Waa'ee isaanii homaa hin beeku ture
More sleep than work.	Hojii caalaa hirriba baay'ee.
You can absolutely do this.	Kana guutummaatti gochuu dandeessa.
Hands are the ones.	Harka jechuun.
There are only two things you can do.	Wanti ati gochuu dandeessu lama qofa.
I love how it looks!.	Akkamitti akka fakkaatu baay'een jaalladha!.
No one has come here.	Namni as dhufe hin jiru.
Like, right now.	Akka, yeroo ammaa.
So wait for it.	Kanaaf eegaa.
I won't say anything about them.	Ani waa'ee isaanii homaa hin jedhu.
I can't believe it, but they say so.	Ani amanuu hin danda'u, garuu akkas jedhu.
I wondered what was different this time	Yeroo kana maaltu adda jedheen yaade
He had many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qaba ture.
That’s just a suggestion.	Sun yaada qofa.
He's so happy she's here.	Inni baay'ee gammadeera isheen as jirtu.
I was alone in the light	Ifa keessa kophaa koo ture
He hadn't even noticed her, but she was there.	Inni ishee illee hin hubanne ture, garuu isheen achi turte.
I certainly do.	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha.
This is usually what you want to do.	Yeroo baayyee waan ati gochuu barbaaddu kana.
It's going to be a very long time.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa ta'uuf jira.
That’s how we’re going to do it.	Akkasitti gochuuf jirra.
He was waiting for them	Isaan eegaa ture
I wonder what we’re doing tomorrow	Boru maal gochaa jirra jedheen yaada
When she’s not with him.	Yeroo isheen isa waliin hin jirre.
I like the feel of it	Miira isaa natti tola
I can't believe this is happening	Kun ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
She didn't have much.	Waan baay'ee hin qabdu turte.
But it really didn’t matter.	Garuu dhuguma dhimma hin qabu ture.
I wouldn't have wanted to.	Silaa hin barbaadu ture.
There, you can go now.	Achitti, amma deemuu dandeessa.
I do that again here.	Ani asitti ammas akkas nan godha.
I have no intention of doing that now	Amma akkas gochuuf yaada hin qabu
I couldn’t help saying sorry	Dhiifama jechuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I think this was not a good idea	Kun yaada gaarii hin turre jedheen yaada
Two questions, please.	Gaaffii lama mee.
Otherwise everything was fine.	Yoo kana hin taane wanti hundi gaarii ture.
He was not clear on this	Kana irratti ifa hin turre
Please be specific.	Mee adda ta'aa.
Maybe you'll go.	Tarii ni deemtu ta'a.
It was true, though.	Dhugaa ture garuu.
You can come back here.	Asitti deebi'uu dandeessu.
I didn’t see her again.	Ammas ishee hin argine.
I think she is.	Isheen akka jirtu natti fakkaata.
I don’t think anyone else saw it	Namni biraa waan arge natti hin fakkaatu
He shouldn't stay here.	As turuu hin qabu.
I think you both need to find this place	Lamaan keessan iyyuu bakka kana argachuu qabdu jedheen yaada
It was the door.	Balbala ture.
If only.	Yoo qofa.
I don’t know how to go about this.	Kana akkamitti akka deemu hin beeku.
He thought about it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf itti yaade.
This time, however, it may be different.	Yeroo kana garuu adda ta'uu danda'a.
Now look at your food.	Amma nyaata keessan ilaalaa.
There is nothing you can do in that situation.	Haala sana keessatti wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
But then it wasn’t.	Garuu sana booda hin turre.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
It’s just a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa.
But then something happened today.	Garuu sana booda har'a wanti tokko ta'e.
I wouldn't have said it.	Silaa hin jedhu ture.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
I have a lot of that	Sana baay'een qaba
He is a good father.	Abbaa gaarii dha.
I was glad that wasn’t the case	Akkas akka hin taane nan gammade
Everything is new.	Wanti hundi haaraa dha.
I love this dog so much.	Saree kana baay'een jaalladha.
I didn't need it.	Na hin barbaachifne.
I will do whatever it takes.	Waan barbaachisu hunda nan godha.
I never knew you could do this	Kana gochuu akka dandeessu gonkumaa hin beeku ture
We didn’t talk.	Nuti hin dubbanne.
Something wasn't right about her.	Waa'ee ishee wanti tokko sirrii hin turre.
I can't make it not happen.	Akka hin taane gochuu hin danda'u.
I wondered how she did that	Akkamitti akkas goote jedheen yaade
He came before the house.	Mana dura dhufe.
I still have a lot to offer.	Ammallee waan baay'ee qaba.
I wouldn’t have thought of him as a bad guy	Silaa nama hamaa jedhee hin yaadu ture
Which is very long.	Kan baayyee dheeraa ta'e.
I was me.	Ani ana ture.
I can't say much more right now	Yeroo ammaa kana kana caalaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu hin danda'u
He looked pretty good out there.	Inni achi keessaa baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
First, as	Dura akka .
That was then, this is now.	Sun yeroo sana ture, kun amma.
But not at that time though.	Garuu yeroo sanatti miti garuu.
But we have to find a place.	Garuu bakka argachuu qabna.
Which, of course, he was.	Kan, beekamaadha, inni ture.
No one saw her.	Namni ishee arge hin jiru.
Not if it isn’t.	Yoo hin taane miti.
It wasn’t their business.	Dhimma isaanii hin turre.
Now it was just the two of them.	Amma isaan lamaan qofa ture.
You know how to do this.	Kana akkamitti akka gootu ni beekta.
In some cases.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti.
Hope everything works out well for you.	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti akka siif ta'u abdii qaba.
I never do it.	Ani gonkumaa hin godhu.
I have to go.	Ani deemuu qaba.
They want to see something new.	Waan haaraa arguu barbaadu.
So that’s how it was.	Kanaaf akkas ture.
I thought so.	Akkas jedheen yaade.
That wasn’t good enough.	Sun gaarii hin turre.
Now you just wait.	Amma ati eegaa qofa.
They are with us.	Isaan nu waliin jiru.
We all have our problems.	Hundi keenya rakkoo keenya qabna.
About this accident.	Waa'ee balaa kanaa.
I was a girl.	Ani intala ture.
Now look at me.	Amma na ilaalaa.
He wanted to help.	Gargaaruu barbaade.
I wasn't entirely sure	Guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I thought it was a good idea.	Yaada gaarii natti fakkaate.
That’s the same thing.	Sun kanuma.
I was sure it was her	Ishee akka taate mirkanaa'aa ture
It worked for us.	Nuuf hojjete.
He knows a lot.	Baay'ee beeka.
Sometimes you don’t.	Yeroo tokko tokko hin gootu.
I love playing for him	Isaaf taphachuu nan jaalladha
She didn’t seem to want any food.	Nyaata tokkollee waan barbaaddu hin fakkaatu ture.
He knew three of them well	Isaan keessaa sadii sirriitti beeka ture
No one was here who shouldn't have been.	Namni silaa ta'uu hin qabne as hin turre.
I mean, he's not human.	Inni nama miti jechuu kooti.
They really don’t need it.	Dhuguma isaan hin barbaachisu.
This is so, so important.	Kun akkas, baay’ee barbaachisaa dha.
But that doesn’t mean we can’t find someone.	Garuu nama argachuu hin dandeenyu jechuu miti.
I can't comment about anything else.	Waa'ee waan biraa yaada kennuu hin danda'u.
I thought it was a good idea	Yaada gaarii natti fakkaate
I can't quit, I have to live longer	Dhiisuu hin danda'u, kana caalaa jiraachuu qaba
He must respond quickly	Dafee deebii kennuu qaba
But only a little bit.	Garuu xiqqoo qofa.
I think that’s more than that	Kana caalaa akkas jedheen yaada
If you don't, it doesn't matter.	Yoo hin goone ta'e homaa hin qabu.
But you know it was .	Garuu akka ture beekta .
It was another life.	Jireenya biraa ture.
He will do everything for you.	Waan hundumaa siif godha.
So wait for it.	Kanaaf eegaa.
It was a great time.	Yeroon sun yeroo guddaa ture.
I never say never.	Ani gonkumaa gonkumaa hin jedhu.
Glad it was there.	Achi ta'uu isaatti gammadeera.
Only we can do it.	Kan dandeenyu nu qofa.
She was watching you.	Isin ilaalaa turte.
I know you have feelings	Miira akka qabdu nan beeka
I think it might help	Gargaaruu danda'a jedheen yaada
You can do this!!.	Kana gochuu dandeessu!!.
But mostly her.	Garuu irra caalaa ishee.
A little bit of what goes on.	Waan deemu xiqqoo xiqqoo.
She was just a girl.	Isheen intala qofa turte.
They were still good.	Ammas gaarii turan.
Maybe they'll come to me in broad daylight.	Tarii guyyaa bal'aa keessa naaf dhufu ta'a.
I wonder why that is.	Maaliif akkas ta'e jedheen yaada.
She didn’t know where she was going.	Eessa akka deemtu hin beektu turte.
But maybe he's not that bad.	Garuu tarii inni hangas hamaa miti ta'a.
He has it.	Isa qaba.
You know who you are.	Eenyu akka taate ni beekta.
I couldn't do anything	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye
But it was good.	Garuu gaarii ture.
I looked into it.	Anis keessa ilaale.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Garuu, homaa hin qabu.
He now knew why.	Maaliif akka ta'e amma beeka ture.
I want to know what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaada
You didn’t do anything like that.	Ati waan akkasii hin goone.
I always have them.	Yeroo hundumaa isaan qaba.
It was something like that.	Waan akkasii ture.
She didn't know what to do about it.	Waa'ee isaa maal akka gootu hin beektu turte.
I'll do my best, though.	Waan danda'u hunda nan godha, garuu.
It was him doing something he shouldn’t have done.	Waan silaa gochuu hin qabne hojjechuu isaa ture.
She doesn’t know him.	Isheen isa hin beektu.
It doesn't have to be long.	Dheeraa ta'uu hin qabu.
Light and hope and commitment	Ifa fi abdii fi of kennuu
Before the accident.	Balaa kanaan dura.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I was there.	Ani achi ture.
I thought nothing of it, of course.	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne, beekamaadha.
They had to admit it wasn’t all easy.	Hundi isaa salphaa akka hin turre amanuu qabu turan.
It's just a lot.	Baay'ee qofa.
But that's exactly what happened.	Garuu sirriitti kanuma ta'e.
I knew it was too much	Garmalee akka ta'e nan beeka ture
You know why, of course.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekta, beekamaadha.
I knew this was inevitable	Kun waan hin oolle ta'uu nan beeka ture
It should have been me	Silaa ana ta'uu qaba ture
I didn't know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
Look at my face.	Adda koo ilaalaa.
It was just an idea.	Yaada qofa ture.
They must be going somewhere.	Bakka tokko deemaa jiraachuu qabu.
We have no idea.	Yaada hin qabnu.
Take a look at this.	Mee kana ilaalaa.
I want to know the truth about me	Dhugaa waa'ee koo beekuu barbaada
I think that’s not true anymore	Kana booda sun dhugaa miti jedheen yaada
I wonder what they want	Maal barbaadu jedheen yaada
Not everyone likes that.	Namni hundi akkas hin jaallatu.
I hope this helps you.	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I have no idea why, but something just occurred to me.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu, garuu wanti tokko qofa natti dhufe.
I know you know this.	Kana akka beektu nan beeka.
It goes well.	Akka gaariitti deema.
A bit like a dog really	Xiqqoo akka saree dhuguma
It wouldn’t help her current situation.	Haala amma ishee keessa jirtu hin gargaaru ture.
I know what's going on	Maal ta'aa akka jiru nan beeka
It’s not a human being.	Nama miti.
I think that's what's happening here	Asitti kan ta'aa jiru kanuma jedheen yaada
This had been a new path for him.	Kun isaaf karaa haaraa ta’ee ture.
I don’t need this job.	Hojiin kun na hin barbaachisu.
They were together.	Waliin turan.
But that is not the case now.	Amma garuu akkas miti.
It wasn’t a room.	Kutaa hin turre.
What's the matter? 	Maaltu jira?
They never did it.	Isaan gonkumaa hin hojjenne.
I had no idea what to tell him	Waan itti himu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
They didn’t have any money.	Maallaqa tokkollee hin qaban turan.
I shouldn’t be here	Ani as jiraachuu hin qabu
It must be a long day.	Guyyaa dheeraa ta'uu qaba.
Clearly, this could be a whole book.	Kun kitaaba guutuu ta’uu akka danda’u ifaadha.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
This can be a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta’uu danda’a.
He came to a new place.	Bakka haaraa dhufe.
I couldn’t find her.	Ishee argachuu hin dandeenye.
Three long years, that’s what it took me.	Waggaa dheeraa sadii, kanuma natti fudhate.
I can't tell you who	Eenyu sitti himuu hin danda'u
I have as much as he told me.	Hamma natti hime qaba.
I couldn't tell you.	Sitti himuu hin dandeenye.
She doesn't have a house.	Mana hin qabdu.
Now, we have to go.	Amma, deemuu qabna.
I haven’t seen him yet	Ammallee isa hin argine
Nothing seemed to help.	Wanti gargaaru hin fakkaatu ture.
Hopefully this is clear.	Kun ifa ta'uu abdii qabna.
I can give you that	Sana siif kennuu nan danda'a
Perhaps that is the case.	Tarii akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
This is extremely good.	Kun garmalee gaarii dha.
I know what it’s like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka
Look at all these people.	Namoota kana hunda ilaalaa.
But tell me more about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa caalaatti natti himi.
I have no interest	Fedhii tokkollee hin qabu
It was like living in a house.	Mana keessa jiraachuu fakkaata ture.
I knew she was doing extremely well	Garmalee gaarii hojjechaa akka turte nan beeka ture
I think this is excessive.	Kun garmalee natti fakkaata.
This was not what was going on.	Kun waan deemaa ture hin turre.
I didn't know what had happened	Waan ta'e hin beeku ture
I have no idea what happened after that	Sana booda maaltu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
That can work sometimes.	Sun yeroo tokko tokko hojjechuu dandaʼa.
But it wasn’t true.	Garuu dhugaa hin turre.
I hoped he was doing well	Akka gaariitti akka jiru abdiin qaba ture
You are with me.	Ati na waliin jirta.
This would be great.	Kun guddaa ta'a.
I told him you were doing it.	Ati hojjechaa jirta jedheen itti hime.
I wasn't just trying to be right on the money	Maallaqa irratti sirrii ta'uuf qofa yaalaa hin turre
You are not a human being.	Ati nama miti.
That's how it should be, he told himself.	Akkas ta'uu qaba jedhee ofitti hime.
I really don’t know how to go about it.	Dhuguma akkamitti akkan itti deemu hin beeku.
Look in the picture.	Suuraa keessaa ilaalaa.
There were no people who never understood them.	Namoonni isaan gonkumaa hin hubanne hin turre.
He wanted the truth.	Dhugaa barbaade.
I looked at them carefully	Anis sirriitti isaan ilaale
He just can't see my part of me	Kutaa koo qofa na arguu hin danda'u
It doesn't matter what just happened	Waan amma ta'e homaa hin qabu
She really didn’t know.	Dhuguma isheen hin beektu turte.
I didn't know about you guys	Ani waa'ee keessan hin beeku ture
People without hope.	Namoota abdii hin qabne.
I was doing some thinking this morning.	Ganama kana yaada tokko tokko hojjechaa ture.
But this is not our business.	Garuu kun dhimma keenya miti.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
That they always were	Yeroo hundumaa akka turan
We have to give up.	Dhiisuu qabna.
I did as he said	Anis akkuma inni jedhe godhe
I know he will do it.	Akka inni godhu nan beeka.
He should have been there for you	Silaa siif achi jiraachuu qaba ture
No one would have been able to find him.	Silaa namni isa argachuu hin danda'u ture.
He did so reluctantly	Fedhii malee akkas godhe
I wanted to see that place again	Bakka sana ammas arguu barbaade
I knew it was him	Isa akka ta'e nan beeka ture
This is not the case.	Kun akkas miti.
Maybe you hope he can.	Tarii akka danda'u abdii qabda ta'a.
You know how to help parents.	Warra gargaaruu beekta.
I didn’t have that, either.	Anis sana hin qabu ture,
I can hardly believe it	Ani baay'ee amanuu hin danda'u
We are in real trouble.	Rakkoo dhugaa keessa jirra.
You that morning.	Ati ganama sana.
Two days ago.	Guyyaa lama dura.
He wouldn't have wanted to be in his room.	Silaa kutaa isaa keessa jiraachuu hin barbaadu ture.
I doubt they are dangerous.	Balaa akka qaban nan shakka.
I could have done it.	Ani nan dandaʼa ture.
It wasn’t a bad thing.	Waan hamaa hin turre.
I have to go there tomorrow	Boru achi deemuu qaba
He was around for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf naannoo sana ture
That should all be right.	Sun hundi sirrii ta'uu qaba.
Then again she had a way with people.	Sana booda ammas namoota waliin karaa qabdi turte.
I could have you now	Amma si qabaachuu nan danda'a ture
I can't see who she is	Eenyu akka taate arguu hin danda'u
I looked up at him a lot	Baay'ee ol jedheen isa ilaale
But this time it doesn't work.	Yeroo kana garuu hin hojjetu.
I knew little about him	Waa'ee isaa waanan beeku xiqqoo ture
But I didn’t get into that opportunity.	Garuu carraa sana keessa hin galle.
No one else here seems to have it.	Namni biraa asitti waan qabu hin fakkaatu.
It wasn’t any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee hin turre.
Almost everyone.	Nama hunda jechuun ni danda'ama.
He didn't do anything like that.	Waan akkasii hin hojjenne.
I can't see how it can survive	Akkamitti jiraachuu akka danda'u arguu hin danda'u
I have to make it happen	Akka ta'u gochuun qaba
We have to live a life.	Jireenya jiraachuu qabna.
He had three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba ture.
One more important than what came before.	Kan duraan dhufe caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e tokko.
I know, everything	Ani beeka, waan hundumaa
I knew what he was thinking	Waan inni yaadu nan beeka ture
Of course you can see it now.	Amma arguu akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
I'd rather not have to	Ani dirqama ta'uu dhiisuu naaf wayya
I still don't know.	Ammas hin beekne.
He had to know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba ture.
He doesn’t like it one bit.	Xiqqoo tokkollee hin jaallatu.
They are wrong about this.	Waa'ee kanaa dogoggora qabu.
But certainly not now.	Garuu amma akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That must be something.	Sun waan tokko ta’uu qaba.
He didn't do anything wrong	Waan hamaa hin hojjenne
I wasn’t someone who needed help	Ani nama gargaarsa barbaadu hin turre
I mean, it came to us earlier	Duraan nutti dhufe jechuu kooti
I have no idea what that is	Sun maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
She is not human enough.	Isheen nama gahaa miti.
I didn’t know what to do with you	Maal akkan si godhu hin beeku ture
I couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t see anyone.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye, nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
I love that moment.	Yeroo sana baay'een jaalladha.
We are going to be who we are.	Nuti eenyu akka taane ta'uuf jirra.
Everything seems to work fine.	Wanti hundi waan gaarii hojjetu fakkaata.
You have to see this.	Kana arguu qabda.
That seemed like a bad thing.	Sun akka waan hamaa fakkaata ture.
Now I wanted him inside me	Amma keessa koo keessa isa barbaade
He can do whatever he wants.	Waan barbaade gochuu dandaʼa.
But then again it would never happen.	Garuu sana booda ammas gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
It always took us longer.	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo dheeraa nutti fudhate.
There can't be one that big in here.	As keessa tokko hangas guddaa ta'e jiraachuu hin danda'u.
It is more necessary.	Caalaatti barbaachisa.
I hope that is not the case	Akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba
He was not disinterested.	Inni fedhii hin qabne hin turre.
But that was the case in those days.	Garuu bara sana akkas ture.
I have some work to do there	Hojii tokko tokko achitti hojjechuu qabu qaba
They are completely different.	Isaan guutummaatti adda.
Not too sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e baay'ee mirkanaa'aa miti.
It’s really not like that.	Dhuguma akkas miti.
Take a look!.	Mee ilaalaa!.
I couldn’t help myself anymore.	Sana booda of gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
But no one thought about it.	Garuu namni itti yaade hin jiru.
I didn't know it would be a problem	Rakkoo akka ta'u hin beeku ture
He doesn't like to talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin jaallatu.
I think that would be pretty easy	Sun baayyee salphaa ta'a jedheen yaada
He always knew.	Yeroo hundumaa beeka ture.
But it still doesn’t work.	Garuu ammas hin hojjetu.
I have been doing this for a very long time	Yeroo baayyee dheeraaf kana hojjechaa ture
I didn't know why, but there they were.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture, garuu achi keessa turan.
I think it will come in time	Yeroo booda waan dhufu natti fakkaata
There is nothing for him.	Homaa isaaf hin jiru.
Nothing more is needed.	Kana caalaa wanti hin barbaachisu.
Maybe in an hour, maybe in a day, but soon.	Tarii sa'aatii tokko booda, tarii guyyaa tokko booda, garuu yeroo dhiyootti.
You shouldn’t see it there.	Achitti arguu hin qabdu.
But it can be done.	Garuu ta'uu danda'a.
I certainly don’t want to	Akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha
They really, really have to believe it.	Dhuguma, dhuguma amanuu qabu.
I'm not entirely sure what happened to that.	Sana maaltu akka ta'e guutummaatti hin beeku.
I didn’t want to make the same mistake again	Ammas dogoggora wal fakkaatu hojjechuu hin barbaanne
I wonder how he could have gotten it right	Akkamitti sirriitti argachuu danda'a ture jedheen yaada
It has been the worst in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti isa hamaa ta'ee jira.
I have to tell him we have to go.	Deemuu qabna jedheen itti himuu qaba.
They were her favorites.	Isaan kan isheen jaallattu turan.
Man is still man.	Namni ammallee nama.
I need help with that	Sana irratti gargaarsa na barbaachisa
The timing seemed right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii fakkaata ture.
To do good things.	Waan gaarii hojjechuuf.
I could see everything	Waan hundumaa arguu nan dandaʼa ture
Sometimes this is an important answer.	Yeroo tokko tokko kun deebii barbaachisaa dha.
I want to do something	Waan tokko hojjechuu barbaada
I didn’t understand why she needed it	Maaliif akka ishee barbaachisu naaf hin galle
We have a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee qabna.
The new girl.	Intala haaraa.
I do that from time to time.	Yeroo yeroon akkas nan godha.
All day long, you’re the only one.	Guyyaa guutuu, ati qofa jirta.
I know about them.	Waa'ee isaanii nan beeka.
I hope he is still in good shape	Ammallee haala gaarii irra akka jiru abdiin qaba
There’s something much simpler we can do.	Wanti baay’ee salphaa ta’e hojjechuu dandeenyu jira.
I think it’s not a good idea right now	Yeroo ammaa kana yaada gaarii miti jedheen yaada
I know what you have done	Waan ati goote nan beeka
Our own.	Kan keenya.
I wasn’t that great.	Ani hangas guddaa hin turre.
I think we worked very well together.	Baayyee gaarii waliin hojjenne jedheen yaada.
I can talk about them for hours	Waa'ee isaanii sa'aatii dheeraaf dubbachuu nan danda'a
Everything is working fine.	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
I knew she was there	Achi akka jirtu nan beeka ture
We’re going to go.	Deemaa jirra.
This is what happened that night.	Halkan sana kan ta'e kana.
They’re not that interested.	Isaan hangas fedhii hin qaban.
But it is not the whole truth.	Garuu dhugaa guutuu miti.
I want to do what is right	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjechuu nan barbaada
I had no idea what would happen then.	Yeroo sana maaltu akka ta'u yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
She should have told him then.	Silaa yeroo sanatti itti himuu qabdi turte.
He had only one chance	Carraa tokko qofa qaba ture
This was not enough.	Kun gahaa hin turre.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
I don't say them.	Isaan hin jedhu.
he says.	jedha.
I knew it would happen.	Akka ta'u nan beeka ture.
I know you were there	Achi akka turte nan beeka
He had been doing this for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa kana gochaa ture.
That’s how it’s always been.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
But there may be more to it than that.	Garuu kana caalaa waan biraa jiraachuu danda'a.
It seems to be what everyone wants.	Waan namni hundi barbaadu fakkaata.
I used to think it was lucky.	Duraan carraa natti fakkaata ture.
A long, long time.	Yeroo dheeraa, dheeraa.
I want to quit my job	Hojii koo dhiisuu barbaada
He looked at the girl again.	Ammas intala sana ilaale.
A little too much.	Xiqqoo garmalee.
We need three, though.	Sadii nu barbaachisa garuu.
I can't do anything now	Amma homaa gochuu hin danda'u
What we have.	Waan qabnu.
Of course, this is not exactly the case.	Kun sirriitti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You can't know.	Beekuu hin dandeessu.
This is not about us.	Kun waa'ee keenya miti.
So, he thought three of them.	Kanaaf, isaan keessaa sadii jedhee yaade.
To make a shoe.	Kophee tokko hojjechuuf.
I'm not sure about that.	Ani waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
It was a good night.	Halkan gaarii ture.
This no longer works.	Kun kana booda hin hojjetu.
It just has a place	Bakka qofa qaba
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
I knew it wasn’t	Akka hin taane nan beeka ture
That seemed right.	Sun sirrii fakkaata ture.
I wondered who would want it	Eenyu barbaada jedheen yaade
He goes everywhere.	Bakka hunda deema.
See how it goes.	Akkamitti akka deemu ilaalaa.
I do not know why that is	Maaliif akkas akka taʼe hin beeku
No one went.	Namni hin deemne.
This is not a requirement.	Kun dirqama miti.
Something that's just him.	Waan isa qofa ta'e.
It happened then and it happens now.	Yeroo sana ta'e amma ni ta'a.
You are not one of them.	Ati isaan keessaa tokko miti.
But not getting it.	Garuu argachuu miti.
Not even a human being.	Nama illee miti.
I'm not sure where she is now though.	Amma eessa akka jirtu garuu mirkanaa'aa miti.
But he has little help around him.	Garuu naannoo isaa gargaarsa xiqqoo qaba.
I mean your parents	Warra keessan jechuu kooti
But it’s nice.	Garuu namatti tola.
He had some questions to ask.	Gaaffii tokko tokko gaafachuu qabu qaba ture.
It was nothing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti homaa hin turre.
What do you think will happen?.	Maal ta'a jettanii yaaddu?.
I think this whole thing is such a great idea	Wanti kun hundi yaada guddaa akkasii natti fakkaata
Except for one.	Tokko malee.
Look for them.	Isaan barbaadaa.
That may be the case.	Akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
He was just doing time	Yeroo qofa hojjechaa ture
I still love her so much	Ammallee baay'een ishee jaalladha
It was obvious to me that he hadn’t.	Akka hin qabne naaf ifa ture.
It wasn’t a bad feeling.	Miira hamaa hin turre.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
I can't live like that	Akkas jiraachuu hin danda'u
I know you have to go.	Deemu akka qabdu nan beeka.
There is absolutely no reason to do this.	Kana gochuuf sababni gonkumaa hin jiru.
I wouldn't have known what happened	Silaa waan ta'e hin beeku ture
I thought this was what you wanted	Kun waan ati barbaaddu natti fakkaate
What your job is.	Hojiin kee maal akka ta'e.
If that were even possible.	Osoo sun illee ni danda’ama ta’ee.
It really does work.	Dhuguma ni hojjeta.
It can only do so much.	Waan baay'ee qofa hojjechuu danda'a.
I need you to go to that place	Bakka sana akka deemtu si barbaachisa
I'll go there, too.	Anis achi nan deema.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay’ee.
She did that today.	Har'a akkas goote.
I have nothing more to say.	Kana caalaa waanan jedhu hin qabu.
I want to meet you, soon	Si waliin wal arguu barbaada, dafee
More than anything and everyone.	Waan hundumaa fi nama hunda caalaa.
From what I've seen, it looks like it's not.	Waan arge irraa, akka hin taane fakkaata.
He hasn't done it yet.	Ammallee hin goone.
He didn’t want anyone to know	Namni akka beeku hin barbaanne
Hopefully it will be a great year.	Bara guddaa akka ta'u abdii qabna.
We didn't talk about what we did if that's what you mean.	Waan hojjenne hin dubbanne yoo akkas jechuu kee ta'e.
He didn’t do the right thing	Waan sirrii hin hojjenne
But I have a dog	Ani garuu saree qaba
I know that little girl	Intala xiqqoo sana nan beeka
I think you can help me with some problems	Rakkoo tokko tokko na gargaaruu dandeessa jedheen yaada
Except that they are not.	Isaan akka hin taane malee.
I can go with the parents	Warra waliin deemuu danda'a
Most of the time this works.	Yeroo baayyee kun ni hojjeta.
I hadn’t seen him in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf isa hin argine ture
It just looks great.	Guddaa fakkaata qofa.
I was happy to see him	Anis isa arguu kootti gammadeera
I want to stay with you	Si bira turuu barbaada
If you are truthful.	Yoo dhugaa taate.
I’ve said that many times	Yeroo baay’ee akkas jedheen ture
I wasn't sure he actually had one	Dhuguma tokko qabaachuu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
This has all happened before.	Kun hundi kanaan dura ta’ee ture.
You can't believe it.	Amanuu hin dandeessu.
I think he did better today	Har'a kana caalaa waan hojjete natti fakkaata
I don't know what he's doing.	Waan hojjetu hin beeku.
I wondered if any of this was true	Kun keessaa tokkollee dhugaa taʼuu isaa nan yaade
It was a disaster, of course.	Balaa akka ture beekamaadha.
he asked himself.	jedhee of gaafate.
That’s not why.	Kanaaf miti.
I like that about you	Waa'ee kee kana natti tola
He wanted to scream, but he couldn’t	Iyyuu barbaade, garuu hin dandeenye
What about me for this.	Ana kanaaf maal.
Why don't I do it.	Ani maaliif hin godhu.
I did as he did	Anis akkuma inni godhe godhe
I am not that opinion	Ani yaada sana miti
Not just next year, but right now.	Bara dhufu qofa osoo hin taane, yeroo ammaa.
His stuff is all here.	Wanti isaa hundi as jira.
It's just a sound.	Sagalee qofa.
I had no idea where I was going	Eessa akkan deemu yaada hin qabu ture
But for a long time no one knew.	Yeroo dheeraaf garuu namni kana beeku hin turre.
No one else knows.	Namni biraa hin beeku.
I was fine with that.	Sana waliin gaarii ture.
I still knew it	Ammas nan beeka ture
I have no idea who has me	Eenyu akka na qabu yaada hin qabu
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
I can give you one other name.	Maqaa biraa tokko siif kennuu nan danda'a.
I’m not home, this isn’t home.	Ani mana hin jiru, kun mana miti.
I did it often.	Yeroo baayʼee nan godha ture.
I started asking her what it was like there	Achitti maal fakkaata jedheen ishee gaafachuu jalqabe
We cannot live without it.	Isa malee jiraachuu hin dandeenyu.
All these things.	Wantoota kana hunda.
Not that he would have known.	Silaa beeka jechuu miti.
He wouldn’t have done it	Silaa hin godhu ture
They’re not that good.	Isaan akkas gaarii miti.
This is a possibility.	Kun ta'uu danda'a.
I used to teach in one	Duraan tokko keessatti barsiisaa ture
I wouldn't want that to happen	Ani akkas akka ta'u hin barbaadu ture
I know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e nan beeka.
He said he would look at you.	Si ilaalaa jedhe.
Who asked me.	Kan na gaafate.
I think it's her.	Ishee natti fakkaata.
We shouldn’t be here.	Nuti as jiraachuu hin qabnu.
One can never tell.	Namni gonkumaa himuu hin danda'u.
So, we went again.	Kanaaf, ammas deemne.
He was not in real danger.	Balaa dhugaa keessa hin turre.
I like it a lot better then.	Yeroo sanatti baay'ee natti tola.
I shouldn’t have come to school	Silaa mana barumsaa dhufuu hin qabu ture
Things like that.	Wantoota akka sanaa.
I like to know from time to time	Yeroo yeroon beekuu nan jaalladha
I mean everything else	Waan biraa hunda jechuu kooti
I think they are wrong about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dogoggora waan qaban natti fakkaata.
He’s not a bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa miti.
It just wasn’t mine.	Kan koo qofa hin turre.
It certainly wasn’t us.	Nu akka hin turre beekamaadha.
It seemed out of nowhere.	Waan keessaa waan ba'e fakkaata ture.
There was plenty of time.	Yeroon baayʼee ture.
He knows when the right time is.	Yeroon sirrii yoom akka ta’e ni beeka.
We still have each other.	Ammallee wal qabna.
I can work with that	Sana waliin hojjechuu nan danda'a
I just need the feeling	Miira qofa na barbaachisa
They’re just the two of them.	Isaan lamaan qofa.
We need to get help.	Gargaarsa argachuu qabna.
I think this is none of your business.	Kun dhimma keessan miti jedheen yaada.
We usually don't do that.	Yeroo baay'ee akkas hin goonu.
If she is there.	Yoo isheen achi jirtu.
It’s always there.	Yeroo hundumaa achi jira.
They want to be with their friends.	Hiriyyoota isaanii wajjin taʼuu barbaadu.
I certainly love her.	Ani akkan ishee jaalladhu beekamaadha.
He thinks to himself that he shouldn't have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture jedhee ofitti yaada
It looked good.	Gaarii fakkaata ture.
Some time ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura.
Everything is going well.	Wanti hundi sirriitti deemaa jira.
A great day.	Guyyaa guddaa.
I wanted to get back at him	Isa irratti deebi'uu barbaade
You were in the doorway.	Ati balbala keessa turte.
And I just have to give up	Anis harka kennuu qofa qaba
This is not entirely accurate.	Kun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
I can't tell you the truth yet	Hanga ammaatti dhugaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
I thought he did this all the time	Yeroo hunda kana kan godhu natti fakkaate
They must have been waiting.	Eegaa turan ta'uu qaba.
I don't want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaadu.
It is doing very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jira.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
Not everything is necessary.	Wanti hundi barbaachisaa miti.
That thing will exist.	Wanti sun ni jiraata.
I wouldn’t have thought of that	Silaa sana hin yaadu ture
It doesn't really seem like it.	Dhuguma hin fakkaatu.
I love my father very much	Abbaa koo baay'een jaalladha
I have her in a few of my classes	Kutaa koo muraasa keessatti ishee qaba
Everything is fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii dha.
You can pretty much do anything.	Ati baay'ee waan hundumaa hojjechuu dandeessa.
I couldn't go now.	Amma deemuu hin dandeenye.
I wasn't sure what it was	Maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Until then, everything is fine.	Hanga sanatti wanti hundi gaarii dha.
I'm just like you.	Anis akkuma kee.
They were in enough trouble.	Rakkoo gahaa keessa turan.
I enjoyed it very much	Baay'een itti gammadeera
I mean, look at that guy over there	Gurbaa sana achi ilaalaa jechuu kooti
It was a real disaster	Balaa dhugaa ture
I know what to say to make it stay	Akka inni turuuf maal akkan jedhu nan beeka
But that’s how it started.	Garuu akkasitti jalqabe.
Again and again and again.	Ammas ammas ammas.
Maybe I was too excited.	Tarii garmalee gammadeera.
I thought that was good	Sun gaarii natti fakkaate
I think it was the right thing to do	Waan sirrii ture natti fakkaata
They were sure.	Isaan mirkanaa'aa turan.
There was no one around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin turre.
It looks pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
You have to get it.	Argachuu qabda.
I know she will forgive me	Akka isheen dhiifama naaf gootu nan beeka
I didn’t know where she was	Eessa akka jirtu hin beeku ture
It didn't matter who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e homaa hin turre.
I didn’t really like her that much	Dhuguma hangas ishee hin jaalladhu ture
I can't do this with you anymore	Kana booda kana si waliin gochuu hin danda'u
Then, the other way around.	Sana booda, karaa biraa.
I knew their case	Dhimma isaanii nan beeka ture
I don’t think she does.	Isheen waan gootu natti hin fakkaatu.
Everything was fine.	Hundi gaarii ture.
I knew what he was thinking.	Waan inni yaadu nan beeka ture.
He knew that much.	Hanga sana beeka ture.
I can do this for him	Kana isaaf gochuu nan danda'a
You have to tell me how you know.	Akkamitti akka beektu natti himuu qabda.
They are going for the better.	Gara gaariitti deemaa jiru.
You were right, it was the right thing.	Sirrii turte, waan sirrii ture.
I wasn't a very good person	Ani nama baayyee gaarii hin turre
It was a good time.	Yeroo gaarii ture.
Whatever works for you.	Waan siif hojjetu hunda.
I did not understand how	Akkamitti akka taʼe naaf hin galle
I can find something new out of old things	Wantoota durii keessaa waan haaraa argachuu nan danda'a
That's how it goes.	Akkasitti deema.
I won’t tell you what that did to me	Sun maal akka na godhe sitti hin himu
But that was a long time ago.	Garuu sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
I always knew you were great	Yeroo hundumaa akka ati guddaa taate nan beeka ture
They are just there.	Isaan achi qofa jiru.
There is, of course.	Jira, beekamaadha.
Obviously, things are not so simple.	Wanti akkas salphaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It’s really not like that .	Dhuguma akkas miti .
You can’t do this to people.	Namoota irratti kana gochuu hin dandeessu.
I like his work	Hojiin isaa natti tola
I really like the sound of it	Sagalee isaa baayyee natti tola
It looked like something he had done before.	Waan kanaan dura hojjete fakkaata ture.
I knew there was something about you	Waa'ee kee waan tokko akka jiru nan beeka ture
It was a small handful.	Harka xiqqoo ture.
I think you're right	Ati sirrii natti fakkaata
That’s not my issue.	Sun dhimma koo miti.
You can be vague.	Ati ifa hin taane ta'uu dandeessa.
This can be a bad idea.	Kun yaada hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
I don't know.	Hin beeku.
I didn’t know all the names	Maqaa hunda hin beeku ture
I can be yours, I can be different	Ani kan keessan ta'uu nan danda'a, adda ta'uu nan danda'a
He should have been an adult there	Silaa nama guddaa achi jiru ta'uu qaba ture
We have a lot of work ahead of us.	Hojii baay'ee nu dura jira.
I wouldn't be able to tell you	Silaa sitti himuu hin danda'u ture
I can't do that to that guy	Gurbaa sana irratti akkas gochuu hin danda'u
You know exactly what he did.	Waan inni hojjete sirriitti beekta.
We’re going to make one.	Tokko hojjechuuf jirra.
He had a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee qaba ture.
I am happy to be here.	As jiraachuu kootti gammadeera.
I didn't understand much	Baay'ee naaf hin galle
It took two weeks.	Torban lama fudhate.
A lot of people do that	Namoonni baay'een akkas godhu
I didn’t want to make another mistake	Dogoggora biraa hojjechuu hin barbaanne
This is not a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa miti.
I had nothing more to say	Kana caalaa waanan jedhu hin qabu ture
She was trying to help us.	Nu gargaaruuf yaalaa turte.
I always know when the time is right	Yeroo hundumaa yeroon isaa yoom akka sirrii ta'e nan beeka
You are not wrong.	Ati dogoggora hin qabdu.
He wanted a life.	Jireenya barbaada ture.
I can't tell you what you don't know	Waan ati hin beekne sitti himuu hin danda'u
But he didn't understand.	Garuu hin hubanne ture.
I’m just trying to help.	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa jira.
We had nothing else.	Waan biraa hin qabnu turre.
There was nothing they couldn’t do for us.	Wanti isaan nuuf gochuu hin dandeenye hin turre.
I already knew he wasn't inside	Keessa akka hin jirre duruu beeka ture
I'm looking for her too	Anis ishee barbaadaa jira
He wondered what it could be.	Maal ta'uu danda'a jedhee yaade.
I know you can do the job	Hojii sana hojjechuu akka dandeessu nan beeka
It does the job.	Hojii sana hojjeta.
Why not, of course.	Maaliif akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You can help people from that.	Sana irraa namoota gargaaruu dandeessa.
He had a job.	Hojii qaba ture.
I just need to get it alone	Kophaa isaa argachuu qofa na barbaachisa
I wasn’t here tonight.	Halkan kana as hin turre.
I did as you said	Anis akkuma ati jette godhe
It’s all dangerous.	Hundi isaa balaa qaba.
It must be returned	Deebi'uu qaba
I thought you might be in trouble	Rakkoo keessa jiraachuu dandeessa jedheen yaade
But I can't tell him that	Ani garuu akkas itti himuu hin danda'u
I just can't believe this guy's luck	Carraa gurbaa kanaa qofa amanuu hin danda'u
I want you to know something	Waan tokko akka beektu nan barbaada
This is working.	Kun hojjechaa jira.
It was a matter of when	Dhimma yoom ture
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
I know that it is important to him	Isaaf barbaachisaa akka taʼe nan beeka
But that’s not really a problem.	Garuu sun dhuguma rakkoo miti.
I want you two to do nothing	Isin lamaan homaa akka hin goone nan barbaada
I couldn't go back anymore	Kana booda duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
You guys are.	Isin warra.
I am alone, but I am not alone	Ani kophaa kooti, ​​garuu kophaa koo miti
We stayed with him for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isa bira turre.
I know how you did it	Akkamitti akka goote nan beeka
But you were drinking.	Garuu ati dhugaa turte.
I know what it does to people	Namoota irratti maal akka godhu nan beeka
So, it’s nothing new.	Kanaaf, waan haaraa miti.
Today seemed like yesterday	Har'a kaleessa natti fakkaate
It’s just what we can do.	Waan gochuu dandeenyu qofa.
I want to forgive him	Dhiifama isaaf gochuu barbaada
I know the truth.	Dhugaa jiru nan beeka.
He's waiting for you	Si eegaa jira
I think that’s a good thing	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaata
I think everything is fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii natti fakkaata.
I love your mother too much not to	Haadha kee garmalee jaalladha akka hin taane
That was the thing about them.	Waa'ee isaanii wanti sun ture.
It is still unclear why.	Maaliif akka ta'e ammallee ifa miti.
It had never happened.	Ta'ee hin beeku ture.
That’s not quite right here.	Sun asitti guutummaatti sirrii miti.
It has a great sound	Sagalee guddaa qaba
We wanted to see that happen	Akkas akka ta'u arguu barbaanne
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
It has three eyes.	Ija sadii qaba.
I can't do this for you	Ani kana siif ta'uu hin danda'u
They have a place here.	Asitti bakka qabu.
He’s just a human being.	Inni nama qofa.
They were all trying to be positive.	Hundi isaanii waan gaarii ta'uuf yaalaa turan.
This is all right.	Kun hundi sirrii dha.
I still don't understand.	Ammallee naaf hin galle.
That's if she was home.	Sun osoo isheen mana taate.
Not many were there.	Baay'een achi hin turre.
I have a lot of opportunities	Carraa baay'een qaba
I have a lot of drinking	Dhugaatii baay'een qaba
Look at the picture.	Suuraa ilaalaa.
Probably better not to mention that.	Tarii sana dubbachuu dhiisuu wayya.
The simplest, perhaps.	Kan salphaa ta'e, tarii.
I don't understand why this would happen.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u naaf hin galle.
Now I'm not so sure.	Amma garuu akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I am never alone here	Asitti kophaa koo gonkumaa hin jiru
I was in a different room	Ani garuu kutaa adda taʼe keessa ture
But only a little bit.	Garuu xiqqoo qofa.
I always loved it.	Yeroo hundumaa nan jaalladha ture.
But things inside you.	Garuu wantoota keessa kee jiru.
But he knows him.	Inni garuu isa ni beeka.
I couldn’t believe my luck	Carraa koo amanuu hin dandeenye
It could do some good, in the long run.	Gaarii tokko tokko hojjechuu danda'a, yeroo dheeraa keessatti.
I can't do anything for you.	Ani homaa siif gochuu hin danda'u.
Maybe he had before.	Tarii kanaan dura qaba ture ta'a.
You matter the most.	Ati hunda caalaa dhimma qabda.
But, it can be done.	Garuu, gochuun ni danda'ama.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Garuu waan hin hojjenne fakkaata.
So it took me a long time.	Kanaaf yeroo dheeraa natti fudhate.
I think so without any thought	Akkas jedheen yaada tokko malee
I'm still waiting for an answer.	Ammallee deebii eegaa jira.
It was one of hers.	Kan ishee tokko ture.
But you should know.	Garuu beekuu qabdu.
But that’s my problem.	Garuu rakkoon koo kanuma.
I think we have a chance.	Carraa qabna jedheen yaada.
He thinks of me here, now, tonight.	Inni asitti, amma, halkan kana na yaada.
You better go without us.	Nu malee deemuun siif wayya.
His is a lot.	Kan isaa baay'ee.
It's not anything.	Waan tokkollee miti.
I still didn't know enough about her.	Ammallee waa'ee ishee gahaa hin beeku ture.
It looks pretty bad	Baayyee hamaa fakkaata
I wasn’t with my friends	Hiriyyoota koo waliin hin turre
It was the year before, and it was fine.	Waggaa sana dura ture, gaarii ture.
I don’t have to get a whiff of their thoughts	Yaada isaanii keessaa xiqqoo xiqqoo argachuu hin qabu
I know now that it was a mistake	Dogoggora akka ture amma beeka
He's a good one.	Inni gaarii dha.
But it’s different when it’s your wife.	Garuu yeroo haadha manaa kee taate adda.
I think they can't see it	Kan isaan arguu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
It’s just working right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana hojjechuu qofa.
That’s how it’s going to work.	Akkasitti hojjechuuf deema.
I doubt this is the case.	Kun akka ta'e nan shakka.
I really needed them.	Dhuguma na barbaachisa turan.
It was the same as what existed at the time	Waan yeroo sanatti ture waliin tokko ture
She was big and loud.	Isheen guddaa fi sagalee guddaa qabdu turte.
He knew exactly what she was going to do	Waan isheen gochuuf deemtu sirriitti beeka ture
I'm not right.	Ani sirrii miti.
You would have to ask for one.	Tokko gaafachuu qabda turte.
To be great.	Guddaa ta'uuf.
I can't tell you everything	Waan hundumaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
I’m working on another one.	Kan biraa irratti hojjechaa jira.
This is not so easy.	Kun akkas salphaa miti.
I don't know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
I think we need that money.	Maallaqa sana nu barbaachisa jedheen yaada.
Something none of us have.	Waan nu keessaa namni tokko qabnu.
Now it was their car.	Amma konkolaataa isaanii ture.
I have a lot in common with my mother.	Haadha koo wajjin waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu qaba.
Man.	Nama.
It should be a house for us	Mana nuuf ta'u qaba
It's not mine.	Kan koo miti.
I hope this helps you.	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I was his everything	Ani waan hundumaa isaa ture
But this is not certain.	Garuu kun mirkanaa’aa miti.
I could never work like that	Ani gonkumaa akkasitti hojjechuu hin dandeenye
He had no idea he was wrong	Inni dogoggora akka qabu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It was his own.	Kan isaa ture.
He was great to work with.	Inni waliin hojjechuuf guddaa ture.
I didn’t get in here	Ani asitti hin galle
Sometimes that can happen.	Yeroo tokko tokko sun taʼuu dandaʼa.
I need food right now	Yeroo ammaa kana nyaata na barbaachisa
I could have gone.	Silaa deemuu nan danda'a ture.
I knew she would.	Akka isheen gootu nan beeka ture.
Such people have no sense.	Namoonni akkasii miira hin qaban.
I didn’t see that one	Isa sana hin argine
No one was at the door at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namni balbala irra hin turre.
I am not your father.	Ani abbaa kee miti.
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
I did this.	Ani kana godhe.
I saw what you did to him	Waan ati isa irratti goote arge
He was something.	Inni waan tokko ture.
But I can still see her.	Garuu ammallee ishee arguu danda'a.
I wondered why he was here	Maaliif as jira jedheen yaade
But I couldn't leave him	Ani garuu isa dhiisuu hin dandeenye
It would never work.	Gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
None is too soon.	Tokkollee dafee hin jiru.
But not everyone has it easy.	Garuu namni hundi salphaa hin qabu.
I very rarely do that.	Ani baayyee yeroo muraasaaf akkas godhu.
I want to know if it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekuu barbaada.
Still very good.	Ammas baayyee gaarii dha.
I know he cares about me	Akka naaf yaadu nan beeka
He knew he had a hand in what was happening here.	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru keessatti harka akka qabu ni beeka ture.
That was a bit of luck really.	Sun xiqqoo carraa ture dhuguma.
I thought everyone in the room was watching me	Kutaa keessa namni hundi na ilaalaa jira jedheen yaade
I think more of everyone in the house.	Nama mana keessa jiru hunda caalaa nan yaada.
But of course not.	Garuu akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I was not interested at all	Ani tasumaa fedhii hin qabu ture
Look for it now.	Amma barbaadaa.
He had it really bad.	Inni dhuguma hamaa qaba ture.
There must be.	Jiraachuu qaba.
Wait and see.	Eegaa ilaalaa.
It could not have been better.	Silaa kana caalaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
Three threes.	Sadii sadii.
It used to be different.	Duraan adda ture.
I have to go.	Ani deemuun qaba.
Just one little girl.	Intala xiqqoo tokko qofa.
I even love them both	Lamaan isaanii illee nan jaalladha
I can't say exactly when.	Yoom sirriitti jechuu hin danda'u.
I wasn’t good enough for him at all	Ani tasumaa isaaf gaarii hin turre
That doesn’t work now.	Sun amma hin hojjetu.
She won’t be gone for long now.	Amma yeroo dheeraaf hin deemtu.
But he often did not.	Yeroo baayʼee garuu hin godhu ture.
You’re like that.	Ati akkas jirta.
It seemed inevitable.	Waan hin oolle fakkaata ture.
He went home from work	Hojii irraa gara manaatti deeme
Something we can’t do right now.	Waan yeroo ammaa kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
None of us are.	Tokkollee nu keessaa hin jiru.
I sure want that job.	Hojii sana akkan barbaadu mirkanaa'adha.
I mean, you were great	Ati guddaa turte jechuu kooti
Sometimes it was so perfect.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas guutuu ture.
Which is completely different	Kan guutummaatti adda ta'e
I can't do it alone	Ani kophaa koo hojjechuu hin danda'u
He is doing the right thing	Waan sirrii hojjechaa jira
You can't have too many.	Baay'ee qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
It wasn’t there anymore.	Kana booda hin turre.
It is the best of all.	Hunda caalaa gaarii dha.
I thought that was a pretty good way.	Sun karaa baay'ee gaarii ta'e natti fakkaate.
It’s just her.	Ishee qofa.
Maybe it doesn't.	Tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
I’m just a little girl.	Ani intala xiqqoo qofa.
I thought you were still here	Ammallee as jirta jedheen yaade
I couldn't believe he could do this to me	Kana na gochuu danda'a jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
He accepted without a sound.	Sagalee tokko malee fudhate.
Not any of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee miti.
Again, great work!.	Ammas hojii guddaa!.
I think you will love him	Isa ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
I didn't know what was going to happen	Waan ta'uuf jiru hin beeku ture
Those have nothing to do with the life you want.	Isaan sun jireenya ati barbaaddu wajjin wal hin qaban.
Nothing happened for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti tokkollee hin taane.
Someone was here in the room with her.	Namni tokko ishee waliin as kutaa sana keessa ture.
It really just does	Dhuguma qofa ni godha
Mostly I was waiting.	Irra caalaa eegaa ture.
I didn't know you	Ani si hin beekne
This is certainly not the case.	Kun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Just like anything else.	Akkuma waan biraa.
Good job in saying so.	Akkas jechuu keessatti hojii gaarii.
Probably another accident he didn't want to talk about.	Tarii balaa biraa inni waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne ta'uu hin oolu.
I think you can do something nice for him	Waan gaarii isaaf gochuu dandeessa jedheen yaada
Sometimes it wasn’t easy.	Yeroo tokko tokko salphaa hin turre.
I certainly have my fill	Ani guutuu koo akkan qabu beekamaadha
It was a very big deal	Waan baayyee guddaa ture
But he did not know this.	Inni garuu kana hin beeku ture.
It's still right.	Ammas sirrii dha.
I still can't quite believe it	Ammallee guutummaatti amanuu hin danda'u
But it's probably just an idea.	Garuu tarii yaada qofa ta'uu hin oolu.
I couldn't believe it all happened	Hundi akka ta'e amanuu hin dandeenye
It's almost non-existent now.	Amma hin jiru jechuun ni danda'ama.
I could go this way.	Karaa kanaan deemuu nan danda'a ture.
He has two dogs.	Saree lama qaba.
There were no problems, everything seemed fine.	Rakkoon hin turre, wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
But it didn’t happen that way.	Garuu akkasitti hin taane.
It has its place.	Bakka isaa qaba.
That month.	Ji'a sana.
This was about it.	Kun waa'ee kanaa ture.
Right now we just need some time.	Yeroo ammaa kana yeroo muraasa qofa nu barbaachisa.
And I went up there.	Anis achitti ol ba'e.
You would know me very well.	Silaa baay'ee na beektu turte.
I know what you’re going to do	Waan gochuuf akka jirtu nan beeka
He should make that clear	Sana ifa gochuu qaba
They’re just, they’re just people.	Isaan qofa, isaan namoota qofa.
I would be sure of that.	Silaa sana mirkanaa'aa ta'a.
That’s okay, but it’s different.	Sun homaa miti, garuu adda.
They were enough.	Isaan gahaa turan.
She obviously has her answer.	Deebii ishee akka qabdu ifaadha.
He had a full career.	Hojii hojii guutuu qaba ture.
I like it	Natti tola .
We have a problem.	Rakkoo qabna.
He wants the truth.	Dhugaa barbaada.
I have a lot of friends	Hiriyyoota baay'een qaba
It will be on its way soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti karaa irra jira.
This isn’t that different.	Kun hangas adda miti.
I had no idea what might have happened	Waan taʼuu dandaʼu yaada hin qabu ture
But, he couldn’t stay.	Garuu, turuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe he couldn't, yet.	Tarii hin dandeenye ta'a, ammallee.
I know better than to ask	Gaafachuu caalaa nan beeka
I wanted to know.	Ani beekuu barbaade.
Everyone who thought it was so wrong.	Nama akkas dogoggora jedhee yaade hunda.
I know he's a good man	Nama gaarii akka ta'e nan beeka
I didn’t want that to happen in my book.	Kitaaba koo irratti akkas akka ta’u hin barbaanne.
I know you have a lot of questions	Gaaffii baay'ee akka qabdu nan beeka
I still couldn't go home	Ammallee gara manaatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
I look a lot like her.	Ani baay'een ishee fakkaata.
I haven’t seen them in a while now	Amma yeroo muraasaaf isaan hin argine
Then we were on our own	Sana booda ofii keenya irra turre
I can't stay with you	Si bira turuu hin danda'u
I can't stay here alone	Kophaa koo as turuu hin danda'u
He had no one and nothing	Nama fi homaa hin qabu ture
That won't be easy.	Sun salphaa hin ta'u.
I know her a lot	Baay'een ishee beeka
You weren’t there.	Ati hin turre.
No one knew his name.	Maqaa isaa namni beeku hin turre.
I went through them as if they were my own.	Akka waan kan kootti isaan keessa darbe.
Only it wasn’t so very clear what that was.	Qofa sun maal akka ta’e akkasitti baay’ee ifa hin turre.
Of course, he came many times.	Yeroo baayʼee akka dhufe beekamaadha.
He had a great idea	Yaada guddaa qaba ture
I need your help with them	Gargaarsa keessan isaan waliin barbaada
Not a big deal, just a little bit to do.	Waan guddaa osoo hin taane, xiqqoo qofa hojjechuu qabda.
They are not the same.	Isaan tokko miti.
But they had each other.	Garuu wal qaban turan.
There’s nothing there for you.	Achitti homaa siif hin jiru.
All you want, all you need, is someone to help.	Wanti ati barbaaddu, wanti si barbaachisu, nama gargaaru qofa.
Everything you need to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu hunda.
What is the problem ?.	Rakkoon jiru maali ?.
It just happens.	Ni ta'a qofa.
Something is just not right.	Wanti tokko sirrii miti qofa.
Not exactly easy.	Sirriitti salphaa miti.
What did you do.	Maal goote.
They really love each other.	Dhuguma wal jaallatu.
I want to go alone.	Kophaa koo deemuu barbaada.
He lives in the house.	Mana keessa jiraata.
I have no answer from the issue.	Dhimma irraa deebii hin qabu.
It was so clear the whole time.	Yeroo guutuu akkasitti ifa ture.
He looks fresh and good.	Inni haaraa fi gaarii fakkaata.
I just wanted to say one thing to you	Waan tokko qofa sitti dubbachuu barbaade
I enjoyed it very much	Baay'een itti gammadeera
She had done nothing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti homaa hin goone turte.
That’s what they have now.	Amma qaban kanuma.
I want to say you are right	Ati sirrii dha jechuu barbaada
I think he loves you.	Inni si jaallatu natti fakkaata.
Maybe even better.	Tarii kana caalaa gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
That worked for a while.	Sun yeroo muraasaaf hojjete.
I hadn’t thought of it that way	Akkasitti hin yaadne ture
I couldn't have done it	Silaa gochuu hin danda'u ture
That's not good.	Sun gaarii miti.
He is looking up at her	Ol jedhee ishee ilaalaa jira
He said it wasn't even his idea.	Yaada isaa illee miti jedhe.
It wasn’t working well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa hin turre.
Why, you never do anything again.	Maaliif, kana booda gonkumaa homaa hin gootu.
I have what he said here.	Ani waan inni jedhe asitti qaba.
The inside stuff doesn’t work.	Wanti keessaa hin hojjetu.
He was just like that.	Inni akkas qofa ture.
But I am not like you.	Ani garuu akka kee miti.
She wasn't the only one who spoke that way.	Ishee qofa akkasitti hin dubbanne.
It’s certainly not a bad thing, though.	Waan hamaa akka hin taane beekamaadha, garuu.
I think he's enough	Inni waan gahaa ta'e natti fakkaata
It’s just better that way.	Akkasitti qofa wayya.
It should be fine now.	Amma gaarii ta'uu qaba.
I think it's very accurate	Baayyee sirrii natti fakkaata
He hadn't told me much.	Waan baay'ee natti hin himne ture.
He has a very good life	Jireenya baayyee gaarii qaba
I had no idea what he was doing	Waan inni hojjetu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
People loved him.	Namoonni isa jaallatu turan.
I hope this goes well	Kun akka gaariitti akka deemu abdiin qaba
But he was a good man.	Garuu inni nama gaarii ture.
I don't know what any of this means.	Kana keessaa tokkollee maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku.
That’s your problem.	Rakkoon keessan kanuma.
He has a wife and two children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee lama qaba.
We only have three.	Sadii qofa qabna.
I mean, it was a disaster	Balaa ture jechuu kooti
Her eyes.	Ija ishee.
I don't have a bad feeling.	Miira hamaa hin qabu.
I don't mean that.	Ani akkas jechuu koo miti.
The only thing is, you have to have the right clothes.	Wanti jiru tokko qofa, uffata sirrii qabaachuu qabda.
Not this day.	Guyyaa kana miti.
I told my father what had happened	Waan ta'e abbaa kootti hime
It definitely comes with its problems.	Rakkoo isaa waliin akka dhufu beekamaadha.
Didn't do much else, for a long time	Waan biraa baay'ee hin hojjenne, yeroo dheeraaf
He is not there.	Inni achi hin jiru.
I can talk about it	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu nan danda'a
Then there he was, inside her.	Sana booda achi ture, keessa ishee.
Who took that.	Eenyutu sana fudhate.
I will never love you	Yoomiyyuu si hin jaalladhu
Looks too good to be true.	Garmalee gaarii fakkaata.
More than anything, I want to walk with you	Waan hundumaa caalaa si waliin deemuun barbaada
But I didn't say anything	Ani garuu homaa hin dubbanne
I know you can do it, my boy	Akka ati gochuu dandeessu nan beeka gurbaa koo
I didn't think much of it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baayʼee hin yaadne.
You can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeessu.
We don't think that's the case.	Akkas ta'e nutti hin fakkaatu.
They had no children.	Ijoollee hin qaban turan.
I didn't expect it, but it did	Ani hin yaadne, garuu akkas ta'e
This time no tomorrow mattered.	Yeroo kana boru tokkollee dhimma hin qabu ture.
Someone was there.	Namni tokko achi ture.
It wasn’t true.	Dhugaa hin turre.
No one is telling me what to do.	Namni maal akkan godhu natti himu hin jiru.
You can always leave them out.	Yeroo hundumaa isaan dhiisuu dandeessa.
No one could go back to it	Namni itti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
But it can be very simple.	Garuu baayyee salphaa ta'uu danda'a.
A simple thing in the big picture, perhaps	Suuraa guddaa keessatti waan salphaa, tarii
They want something different.	Waan adda ta'e barbaadu.
I didn’t talk to her	Ishee waliin hin dubbanne
So of all things.	Kanaaf waan hundumaa keessaa.
This was pretty much it for him tonight.	Kun halkan kana baay'ee isaaf ture.
Just walk inside.	Keessa deemuu qofa.
But it’s not just one.	Garuu tokko qofa miti.
I am going to help you	Ani isin gargaaruuf deema
I was pretty sure it wouldn't work	Akka hin hojjenne mirkanaa'aa ture
They work all day during the day.	Guyyaa guutuu guyyaa keessa hojjetu.
What is clear is that he did not.	Wanti ifa ta’e akkas hin goone.
That can't be the case anymore	Kana booda akkas ta'uu hin danda'u
I didn’t need anything more	Kana caalaa wanti na hin barbaachifne
They certainly had to get the idea then.	Yeroo sanatti yaada sana argachuu akka qaban beekamaadha.
I was alone in my thoughts	Yaada koo keessatti kophaa koo ture
I couldn’t leave it like that	Akkasitti dhiisuu hin dandeenye
We need to be more than that.	Sana caalaa ta'uu qabna.
Everyone loves each other.	Namni hundi wal jaallata.
A bit like me last week	Xiqqoo akka koo torban darbe
It’s just something he has to do	Waan hojjechuu qabu qofa
But none are needed.	Garuu tokkollee hin barbaachisu.
I know it’s not something you want to do	Waan ati gochuu barbaaddu akka hin taane nan beeka
He found her.	Ishee argate.
I think I want to know all about it	Waa'ee kana hunda beekuu barbaada jedheen yaada
I am not one of those	Ani warra sana keessaa tokko miti
She had a house.	Mana qabdi turte.
I know she’s not really our daughter	Dhuguma intala keenya akka hin taane nan beeka
I’m looking at them.	Isaan ilaalaa jira.
I can never have you	Yoomiyyuu si qabaachuu hin danda'u
It wasn’t home.	Mana hin turre.
Only humans can do this.	Kana kan godhu nama qofa.
I never knew what to say	Waan jedhu gonkumaa hin beeku ture
You don’t, you know.	Hin gootu, beekta.
It was clear that this would never happen.	Kun gonkumaa akka hin taane ifa ture.
We both have it.	Lamaan keenyayyuu qabna.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I want to go with you	Si waliin deemuu barbaada
So just look closely.	Kanaaf sirriitti ilaalaa qofa.
Otherwise, everything was in place.	Yoo kana hin taane garuu wanti hundi bakka isaatti ture.
But that is not enough.	Sun garuu gahaa miti.
So this matters to us.	Kanaaf kun nuuf dhimma qaba.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
I couldn't have said that at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas jechuu hin danda'u ture.
You'll be.	Si ta'a.
I have no reason not to.	Sababni hin qabne hin qabu.
I don't know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku.
That she always was.	Yeroo hundumaa akka turte.
I knew my way around	Karaa koo naannoo kootti nan beeka ture
This may be true, but it’s probably not the absolute truth.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu danda’a, garuu dhugaa guutuu ta’uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
I told him about it.	Anis waa'ee isaa itti hime.
Look at all the children.	Ijoollee hunda ilaalaa.
That was last week.	Sun torban darbe ture.
To him, this is obviously no big deal.	Isaaf kun waan guddaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
I did, but that wasn’t enough.	Anis nan godhe, garuu sun gahaa hin turre.
Just like he was.	Akkuma inni ture.
I know who looks good	Eenyu akka gaariitti akka fakkaatu nan beeka
You have the whole day.	Guyyaa guutuu qabda.
It wouldn't have been right.	Silaa sirrii hin ta'u ture.
Like it was really going to happen.	Akka waan dhuguma ta'uuf ture.
It just wasn't going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin turre qofa ture.
She is a mother, not a mother	Haadha malee haadha miti
As it should be.	Akkuma ta'uu qabu.
I know they were your friends	Hiriyyoota kee akka turan nan beeka
I can't see anything	Homaa arguu hin danda'u
I don't know exactly when	Yoom akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku
But not really.	Garuu dhuguma miti.
They are waiting for their time.	Yeroo isaanii eegaa jiru.
I looked at the door	Anis balbala ilaale
So there is nothing of interest.	Kanaaf wanti fedhii qabu hin jiru.
A lot of them, probably	Baay'ee isaanii, tarii
I was up here in my house.	Ani as ol mana koo keessa ture.
Some time ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura.
I really needed that	Sana baayʼee na barbaachisa ture
I can't give you a reason for this.	Kanaaf sababa siif kennuu hin danda'u.
That was obvious.	Sun ifa ture.
I want to find another one	Kan biraa argachuu barbaada
I know what you really are	Dhuguma maal akka taate nan beeka
Sorry about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dhiifama.
I couldn’t live with myself.	Of waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
I wanted to be like him	Anis akka isaa ta'uu barbaade
This could be one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko ta’uu danda’a.
You have to make them interested.	Akka fedhii qaban gochuu qabda.
That’s how they knew each other.	Akkasitti wal beeku turan.
There should be no such thing.	Wanti akkasii jiraachuu hin qabu.
I told him he didn’t have to do anything	Homaa gochuun akka hin qabne itti hime
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'een itti gammade.
He already knows how to do that.	Akkamitti akka sana godhu duruu beeka.
I didn’t know you were involved.	Ati harka keessa akka jirtu hin beeku ture.
Perhaps she did.	Tarii akkas goote taʼa.
I really thought she was here with me.	Dhuguma waan isheen as na waliin jirtu natti fakkaate.
I just couldn’t believe that	Kana qofa amanuu hin dandeenye
This was more important.	Kun caalaatti barbaachisaa ture.
That this is the case.	Kun akka ta'e.
I didn’t know what he was doing	Waan inni hojjetu hin beeku ture
I really hope you don't tell anyone about it	Waa'ee kanaa namatti akka hin himne dhuguma abdiin qaba
I can make it your way	Karaa kee akka ta'u gochuu nan danda'a
You have to go.	Deemu qabda.
Sounds like you’re on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra akka jirtu fakkaata.
I would quickly become myself	Dafee ofii koo ta'a ture
Maybe not today.	Tarii har'a ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Maybe no one is there.	Tarii namni tokkollee hin jiru ta'a.
But it's happening.	Garuu ta'aa jira.
Just being together.	Waliin ta'uu qofa.
I had to make this happen	Kana akka ta'u gochuun qaba ture
Must have full time.	Yeroo guutuu qabaachuu qaba.
I could have gone that day	Silaa guyyaa sana deemuu nan danda'a ture
It was all her.	Hundi ishee ture.
You don’t look good.	Ati gaarii hin fakkaattu.
I hope that is my problem	Rakkoon koo kanuma akka ta'e abdiin qaba
Going somewhere else.	Bakka biraa deemuu.
That’s not really true.	Sun dhuguma dhugaa miti.
I love that about him.	Waa'ee isaa sana nan jaalladha.
But it wasn’t good.	Garuu gaarii hin turre.
All there was, was a book.	Wanti ture, kitaaba qofa ture.
That’s a mistake.	Sun dogoggora.
Tonight this is one of them.	Halkan kana kun isaan keessaa tokko.
I didn’t know that either	Anis sana hin beeku ture
It wasn’t just clothes.	Uffata qofa hin turre.
Nothing is easy.	Wanti salphaa ta'e hin jiru.
I know what you have done	Waan ati goote nan beeka
No one would have known.	Silaa namni beeku hin jiru.
Not your best day.	Guyyaa kee isa gaarii miti.
It did him a lot of good	Gaarii baay'ee isa godhe
That’s just how it goes.	Akkasitti deemuu qofa.
So I knew what this was all about	Kanaaf, kun hundi maal akka taʼe nan beeka ture
I wasn't sure it was true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I have no answers that can help you.	Deebii si gargaaruu danda'u hin qabu.
He thought for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf yaade.
There we are, again.	Achi jirra, ammas.
It will be in question.	Gaaffii keessa ni jiraata.
You know what he means.	Maal jechuu isaa beekta.
He shouldn’t have even been there	Silaa achi illee jiraachuu hin qabu ture
I knew him well enough	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka ture
This wasn't too bad though.	Kun garuu baayyee hamaa hin turre.
I won’t do that tonight	Halkan kana akkas hin godhu
I don't understand this one.	Isa kana naaf hin galle.
I didn’t have much hope	Abdii guddaa hin qabu ture
I’m not going to do that.	Akkas gochuuf hin deemu.
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I really want to be here.	Ani baay'een as jiraachuu barbaada.
I absolutely love it!.	Guutummaatti nan jaalladha!.
He's going to be.	Inni ni ta'a.
Then he didn’t.	Sana booda hin goone.
I don't mean that	Akkas jechuu koo miti
I can't tell you how	Akkamitti sitti himuu hin danda'u
I wanted to be one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu barbaade
Perhaps it wasn't.	Tarii hin turre taʼa.
Something must be wrong.	Wanti tokko dogoggora taʼuu qaba.
One time, an accident.	Yeroo tokko, balaa.
You need to know this.	Kana beekuu qabda.
I can't do things right	Waan sirriitti hojjechuu hin danda'u
Of course, that is not the case	Akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha
You have a great voice.	Sagalee guddaa qabda.
But he wouldn’t do it.	Garuu hin godhu ture.
I love that little guy	Gurbaa xiqqoo sana nan jaalladha
But their time was up.	Garuu yeroon isaanii darbe.
He is no longer my teacher.	Kana booda barsiisaa koo miti.
In that place.	Bakka sanatti.
That’s not the only problem you have.	Rakkoon ati qabdu kana qofa miti.
I don't have time for that	Kanaaf yeroo hin qabu
I can't live without it	Isa malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
He was another great man.	Nama guddaa biraa ture.
I should have told him a long time ago	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura itti himuu qaba ture
But man has more.	Namni garuu kana caalaa qaba.
So sorry for that.	Kanaaf dhiifama.
This was not true.	Kun dhugaa hin turre.
So, you have to do something.	Kanaaf, waan tokko gochuu qabda.
I can do the right thing.	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjechuu nan dandaʼa.
So far, everyone loves the idea.	Hanga ammaatti namni hundi yaada kana ni jaallata.
But it’s not even.	Garuu iyyuu miti.
This is the one.	Kun isa.
You can do what works for you.	Waan siif hojjetu gochuu dandeessa.
She didn't know why she was doing that but it seemed right.	Maaliif akkas gochaa akka turte hin beektu garuu sirrii fakkaata ture.
She hadn’t seen it.	Isheen hin argine turte.
Not even very long.	Baayyee dheeraa illee miti.
I couldn’t do another one.	Kan biraa hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
It was just too fresh.	Garmalee haaraa qofa ture.
Now he understood.	Amma hubate.
I came up with just him.	Isa qofa jedheen dhufe.
I need it in my room.	Kutaa koo keessatti na barbaachisa.
It will be very good for you.	Baayyee gaarii siif ta'a.
Now we are friends.	Amma hiriyyoota taane.
Very, very accurate.	Baayyee baayyee sirrii dha.
Then it came to me.	Sana booda natti dhufe.
But not very long.	Garuu baay'ee dheeraa miti.
He is not one of us.	Inni nu keessaa tokko miti.
I hope she doesn’t see it though	Isheen garuu akka hin argine abdiin qaba
I thought about it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf jedheen yaade.
But they had to have it.	Garuu qabaachuu qabu turan.
Nothing is there for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf wanti achi jiru hin jiru.
I looked around the bar.	Anis naannoo mana dhugaatii sanaa ilaale.
It's going to be more for you.	Caalaatti siif ta'uuf deema.
I hope you are not in any trouble	Rakkoo tokko keessa akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
You never quite have it.	Ati gonkumaa guutummaatti hin qabdu.
He had no job to go to	Hojii itti deemu hin qabu ture
I couldn't do it.	Ani gochuu hin dandeenye.
I couldn't have been more wrong.	Kana caalaa dogoggora qabaachuu hin danda'u ture.
Just back here.	Asitti deebi'uu qofa.
I didn’t do that.	Ani akkas hin goone.
I'm looking inside.	Ani keessa barbaada.
He looked into his eyes	Ija isaa keessa ilaale
But some of them.	Garuu tokko tokko.
So he has every chance	Kanaaf carraa hunda qaba
But he was just as bad as everyone else.	Garuu akkuma nama hundumaa hamaa ture.
But you know who knows.	Garuu beekta eenyutu beeka.
But she would go no further.	Garuu kana caalaa hin deemtu turte.
He knew exactly what was happening	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeka ture
It doesn't matter what he says.	Waan inni jedhu homaa hin qabu.
Just playing up to it.	Hanga isaatti taphachuu qofa.
And yet it happened.	Ammas ta'ee.
That was it .	Kana ture .
I knew they were here	As akka turan nan beeka ture
I didn’t know anyone	Nama tokkollee hin beeku ture
I couldn't have asked for more	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u ture
I wanted to see her with someone like that	Nama akkasii waliin ishee arguu barbaade
I didn't need one, but what the hell	Tokko na hin barbaachifne, garuu maaltu ta'a
I would have gone	Silaa nan deema ture
I didn’t want her to go long	Yeroo dheeraa akka deemtu hin barbaanne
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
Which is not easy.	Kan salphaa hin taane.
I was on my way home	Anis karaa gara manaatti deemaa ture
I’m not just saying that	Ani kana qofa jechuu koo miti
I’ll never do that again, you know that	Kana booda yoomiyyuu akkas hin godhu, ati kana beekta
But this stuff might not necessarily be what you want.	Garuu wanti kun dirqama waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu hin danda'u.
Which you still don’t have.	Kan ammallee hin qabne.
You have no idea what is going on.	Waan deemaa jiru yaada hin qabdu.
I had everything going for me	Waan hundumaa naaf deemaa ture
I can't believe this guy	Gurbaa kana amanuu hin danda'u
This morning will be a good time.	Ganama kana yeroo gaarii ta'a.
I want to go now.	Amma deemuu barbaada.
Now I'm very happy.	Amma baay'een gammade.
Everything will be clear next week.	Torban dhufu wanti hundi ifa ta'a.
He had nowhere to go	Bakka itti deemu hin qabu ture
That’s one thing.	Sun waan tokko.
It couldn't be more different	Kana caalaa adda ta'uu hin danda'u
What could possibly go wrong?.	Maaltu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a?.
So every day, he got something.	Kanaaf guyyaa hunda, waan tokko argate.
But one thing was certain.	Garuu wanti tokko mirkanaa’aa ture.
We need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna.
But you need it.	Garuu si barbaachisa.
I had no life before you	Si dura jireenya hin qabu ture
But he knew what it was	Maal akka ta'e garuu beeka ture
I still want everything to be right	Ammas wanti hundi sirrii akka ta'u nan barbaada
You are absolutely there.	Ati guutummaatti jirta.
He is still on the road.	Ammas karaa irra jira.
That can't be right.	Sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I couldn’t leave him	Isa dhiisuu hin dandeenye
But he is a man.	Inni garuu nama dha.
They love me and they love each other.	Na jaallatu wal jaallatu.
This wasn’t hers.	Kun kan ishee hin turre.
He was such a great guy.	Gurbaa guddaa akkasii ture.
We must come again.	Ammas dhufuu qabna.
I can't say exactly why	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti dubbachuu hin danda'u
He had a little girl.	Intala xiqqoo tokko qaba ture.
I still couldn’t eat it	Ammallee nyaachuu hin dandeenye
I just didn't know what it was	Maal akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture
But it is not complete.	Garuu guutuu miti.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
You can make a lot of money up there.	Achi ol qarshii guddaa argachuu dandeessa.
I don't know why he thinks.	Maaliif akka yaadu hin beeku.
That’s my problem.	Rakkoon koo kanuma.
But that would obviously be wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora akka ta’u ifaadha.
I wondered what I would do	Maal godha jedheen yaade
I know you very well	Baay'ee si beeka
Perhaps you can tell me.	Tarii natti himuu dandeessu taʼa.
I just have to tell him	Itti himuu qofa qaba
I can see well with that	Sana waliin akka gaariitti arguu nan danda'a
It goes both ways.	Karaa lamaan deema.
But I couldn’t do anything with them.	Garuu isaan waliin homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
That may be true.	Sun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I'll go the other way.	Karaa biraa nan deema.
He didn’t have that house for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf mana sana hin qabu ture
It didn’t matter one bit	Xiqqoo tokkollee dhimma hin qabu ture
It doesn’t seem real anymore.	Kana booda dhugaa hin fakkaatu.
I can do that already	Ani duruu sana gochuu nan danda'a
He could no longer see me as me.	Kana booda akka kootti na arguu hin danda'u ture.
I just can't do this anymore	Kana booda kana gochuu qofa hin danda'u
He wants to know he'll be fine	Inni gaarii akka ta'u beekuu barbaada
She needed sleep.	Hirriba ishee barbaachisa ture.
Not important, really.	Barbaachisaa miti, dhuguma.
If not then go home.	Yoo hin taane sana booda gara manaatti deebi'i.
Sometimes, momentarily, he came to me.	Yeroo tokko tokko, yeroo muraasaaf, gara kootti dhufe.
It looks like a lot.	Baayyee fakkaata.
I think you're onto something.	Waan tokko irratti waan jirtu natti fakkaata.
But he was here.	Inni garuu as ture.
A few weeks ago.	Torban muraasa dura.
Of a new life.	Kan jireenya haaraa.
You shouldn’t have come here.	Silaa as dhufuu hin qabdu turte.
So this is the problem.	Kanaaf rakkoon jiru kana.
It would be much easier.	Silaa baayyee salphaa ta'a.
Then it will work.	Sana booda ni hojjeta.
This was not to be the case.	Kun akkasitti ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I didn't think so	Akkasitti hin yaadne
I could have gone.	Deemu nan danda'a ture.
I know it was a mistake	Dogoggora akka ture nan beeka
Maybe this is one of them.	Tarii kun isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu danda'a.
I knew this wasn’t going to go well	Kun akka gaariitti akka hin deemne nan beeka ture
That’s how it’s always been.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
He should have known better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
I think she never said she didn't know	Isheen hin beektu jettee hin beektu natti fakkaata
They had no children	Ijoollee hin qaban turan
In this case it will.	Haala kana keessatti ni ta’a.
That can’t be the case.	Sun akkas ta’uu hin danda’u.
Now it was mine.	Amma kan koo ture.
I haven’t seen any of them yet	Isaan keessaa hanga ammaatti tokkollee hin argine
Mostly just wrong.	Irra caalaa dogoggora qofa.
She didn't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabdu turte.
But that’s not enough.	Garuu sun gahaa miti.
He wanted to ask again	Ammas gaafachuu barbaade
I might buy it before that	Sana dura bitachuu danda'a
I don't want to believe anything.	Ani homaa amanuu hin barbaadu.
I wondered where everyone was	Namni hundi eessa jira jedheen yaade
There is too much.	Garmalee jira.
That’s the same thing.	Kanuma sana.
I didn't think it would happen.	Ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne.
Nobody could have done it better than you.	Namni si caalaa hojjechuu hin danda'u ture.
Not that he knows about the real house.	Waa'ee mana dhugaa beeka jechuu miti.
But he knows his job.	Garuu hojii isaa ni beeka.
We should have stayed.	Silaa turuu qabna turre.
I don't know his name.	Maqaa isaa hin beeku.
It wasn’t that bad.	Akkas hamaa hin turre.
He has a chance.	Carraa qaba.
I need you to be there for me	Akka ati naaf achi jirtu na barbaachisa
You’re not in it.	Ati keessa hin jirtu.
But this doesn't seem to work.	Kun garuu waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
This is my job.	Kun hojii kooti.
They are not interested in you.	Isaan siif fedhii hin qaban.
I knew then what could happen	Yeroo sanatti waan ta'uu danda'u nan beeka ture
They seem to have .	Isaan waan qaban fakkaata .
We have been waiting for this for a long time.	Kana yeroo dheeraaf eegaa turre.
I really wanted to see his place	Bakka isaa arguu baay'een barbaade
I can do it tomorrow	Guyyaa boru gochuu nan danda'a
A lot of people tell me that	Namoonni baay'een akkas natti himu
It works very well for me.	Naaf baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I can't leave him alone	Kophaa isaa dhiisuu hin danda'u
I had no idea it would be so much more.	Hamma kana caalaa akka ta'u yaada hin qabu ture.
You said it was happening before, it wasn't.	Kanaan dura ta'aa jira jettee, hin turre.
Except they were.	Isaan turan malee.
So it should be good.	Kanaaf gaarii ta'uu qaba.
He must know what is happening	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba
This seems obvious.	Kun ifa fakkaata.
She didn't know.	Isheen hin beekne turte.
He makes mistakes.	Dogoggora ni hojjeta.
Those people had a time.	Namoonni sun yeroo tokko qaban turan.
They should ask in my book.	Kitaaba koo keessatti gaafachuu qabu.
I didn't understand either	Anis naaf hin galle
Nothing is just what it is.	Wanti tokkollee waan jiru qofa miti.
I know there is no more	Kana caalaa akka hin jirre nan beeka
But no one ever asked me.	Garuu namni na gaafate hin beeku.
Then I will go	Yeroo sana nan deema
I hadn’t thought of it before	Kana dura hin yaadne ture
Maybe it's not necessary.	Tarii hin barbaachisu ta'a.
This is my life.	Kun jireenya kooti.
So it’s a good thing.	Kanaaf waan gaarii dha.
I didn't really think much of it	Dhuguma baay'ee itti hin yaadne
They don’t care about you, any of them.	Isaan siif dhimma hin qaban, isaan keessaa tokkollee.
Everything about the room was great.	Wanti kutaa sana keessa jiru hundi guddaa ture.
I don’t need my parents anymore	Kana booda warra koo na hin barbaachisu
You have enough without me.	Ana malee gahaa qabda.
So I know it’s not.	Kanaaf akka hin taane nan beeka.
I couldn't stop talking about you	Waa'ee kee dubbachuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I knew there was something here.	Asitti waan tokko akka jiru nan beeka ture.
But we are nothing.	Garuu nuti homaa miti.
I didn’t think they would do this.	Kana ni godhu jedhee hin yaadne.
She would never have done that.	Silaa gonkumaa akkas hin gootu turte.
Maybe if we.	Tarii yoo nuti.
A very light drink.	Dhugaatii baayyee salphaa ta'e.
I knew something was up	Waan tokko akka jiru nan beeka ture
I don’t know myself.	Of hin beeku.
That very rarely happens.	Sun baayyee yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
It’s not him, though.	Isa miti garuu.
I think you should meet him, get to know him	Isa waliin wal arguu qabdu, isa beekuu qabda jedheen yaada
There is no reason.	Sababni hin jiru.
Here, she had everything she could want.	Asitti, waan barbaaddu hunda qabdi turte.
I wasn't sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
You have three hours.	Sa'aatii sadii qabda.
Unique.	Adda.
I couldn't tell him about that	Waa'ee sanaa itti himuu hin dandeenye
I never knew they were real	Dhugaa ta'uu isaanii gonkumaa hin beeku ture
It's a good night.	Halkan gaarii dha.
I could never give up on her	Yoomiyyuu harka ishee kennuu hin dandeenye
I haven't seen it yet	Ammallee hin argine
But that didn’t work out that way.	Garuu sun akkasitti hin hojjenne.
There is no other problem.	Rakkoon biraa hin jiru.
Nothing else works.	Wanti biraa hin hojjetu.
I can ask them.	Isaan gaafachuu nan danda'a.
I can always find someone more interested	Yeroo hundumaa nama caalaatti fedhii qabu argachuu nan danda'a
I'm happy too.	Anis gammadeera.
I can't be the only one who knows	Kan beeku ana qofa ta'uu hin danda'u
This is more like him.	Kun caalaatti isa fakkaata.
It can only do very dangerous things.	Wantoota baay’ee balaa qaban qofa hojjechuu danda’a.
Now they have it.	Amma qaban.
Seems like the easiest way.	Karaa salphaa ta'e fakkaata.
That was going to happen.	Sun ta'uuf ture.
Which, of course, is definitely not the case.	Kan, beekamaadha, akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He wanted to stay there.	Achi turuu barbaade.
I love everyone at home	Nama mana jiru hunda nan jaalladha
I meant to tell you yesterday	Kaleessa sitti himuu jechuu kooti
Then one day, it’s here.	Sana booda guyyaa tokko, as jira.
I know you better than that	Kana caalaa si beeka
It usually works	Yeroo baayyee ni hojjeta
Then she became a teacher.	Sana booda barsiisaa taate.
That is very important.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
The right thing to do.	Wanti sirrii ta'e.
You said it.	Ati jette.
None of us should be here today.	Har'a nu keessaa tokkollee as jiraachuu hin qabu.
I looked at the picture carefully	Suuraa sana sirriitti ilaale
I shouldn’t have left her alone when she needed me	Yeroo isheen na barbaaddu kophaa ishee dhiisuu hin qabu ture
I can tell you this.	Kana sitti himuu nan danda'a.
It wasn't like that for a very long time.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraaf akkas hin turre.
I know you have a job	Hojii akka qabdu nan beeka
, .	, .
But that is not what is happening.	Garuu wanti ta'aa jiru akkas miti.
One didn’t do that, if it wasn’t necessary.	Tokko akkas hin goone, yoo barbaachisaa hin taane.
I don't know what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
I saw it, too.	Anis arge.
Everything is fine so far.	Hanga asitti wanti hundi gaarii dha.
I don’t mean to tell you what to do	Waan gootu sitti himuu jechuu koo miti
I just had no idea what to say	Ani garuu maal akkan jedhu yaada hin qabu ture
I have nothing bad to say about this at all	Waa'ee kanaa tasumaa waan hamaa jedhu hin qabu
I didn't tell him any of that though	Waa'ee sanaa tokkollee itti hin himne garuu
It wasn’t clear.	Ifa hin turre.
You don’t even want to.	Illee hin barbaaddu.
But it was so much more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa baayyee ture.
I thought it would work	Ni hojjeta jedheen yaade
I say I hope we can stay	Turuu akka dandeenyu abdiin qaba jedha
They were just things.	Isaan waan qofa turan.
You never were.	Ati gonkumaa hin turre.
That's how they do it.	Akkasitti godhu.
I can't do this anymore	Kana booda kana gochuu hin danda'u
Then he left for home.	Sana booda gara manaatti ba'e.
I had no idea what it could be	Maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I was just here to do a job	Hojii tokko hojjechuuf qofa as ture
They make it a duty to themselves.	Dirqama ofitti godhu.
Sometimes I just can't believe it	Yeroo tokko tokko qofa amanuu hin danda'u
Nothing like that was true.	Wanti akkasii dhugaa hin turre.
He has, he really does.	Inni qaba, dhuguma qaba.
You don't want us.	Nu hin barbaaddu.
He doesn't really know me.	Dhuguma na hin beeku.
I wanted to see it.	Anis arguu barbaade.
I don't know why this is happening	Kun maaliif akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku
But they were there now.	Garuu amma achi turan.
I have something else to do for you.	Waan biraa siif gootu qaba.
I am always with you	Yeroo hundumaa isin waliin jira
I thought we did all that	Kana hunda hojjenne jedheen yaade
I don’t know if they will do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuu fi dhiisuu isaanii hin beeku.
He said he didn't know.	Hin beeku jedhe.
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
I can't believe it isn't	Akka hin taane amanuu hin danda'u
It's mine.	Kan kooti.
It works well now.	Amma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I don't know what could possibly go wrong anymore.	Kana booda maaltu dogoggora ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku.
I wonder if you wouldn’t know that	Silaa sana hin beektu jedheen yaada
It was somewhat true.	Hamma tokko dhugaa ture.
I know it could be something, it probably is	Waan ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka, tarii ta'uu hin oolu
It can't be happening now.	Amma ta'aa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
I think everyone did well tonight	Halkan kana namni hundi waan gaarii hojjete natti fakkaata
I don't want one.	Tokko hin barbaadu.
I miss you so much.	Baay'een si yaade.
I mean, look at her dress	Uffata ishee ilaalaa jechuu kooti
Often she thinks	Yeroo baay'ee isheen yaada
It’s not all bad though.	Hundi isaa garuu hamaa miti.
I think there's a lot.	Baay'ee waan jiru natti fakkaata.
I don’t have it.	Hin qabu.
I can do whatever it takes	Waan barbaachisu hunda gochuu nan danda'a
They just don’t have it.	Isaan qofa hin qaban.
After a while.	Yeroo muraasa booda.
I knew we could see it now	Amma arguu akka dandeenyu nan beeka ture
I just need it this week	Torban kana qofa na barbaachisa
I have to do something this time	Yeroo kana waan tokko gochuun qaba
I want us to be together now	Amma akka waliin taane nan barbaada
This is not the place for you.	Kun bakka siif hin ta'u.
And he will do it again.	Ammas ni godha.
I don't really understand what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru dhuguma naaf hin galle.
I shouldn’t have said that	Silaa akkas jechuu hin qabu ture
I wasn't sure of anything anymore.	Kana booda homaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
That will probably do.	Sun gochuun hin oolu.
It doesn’t matter where it is.	Bakka jiru homaa hin qabu.
But now you are something else.	Amma garuu ati waan biraa taate.
I thought of you often	Yeroo baay'ee si yaada ture
One would like to believe that it is	Namni tokko akkas ta’uu isaa amanuu barbaada
I think this is simple enough.	Kun salphaa gahaa natti fakkaata.
This is obvious.	Kun beekamaadha.
Except mine, of course.	Kan koo malee, beekamaadha.
We were doing well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa turre.
This was maybe two years ago.	Kun tarii waggaa lama dura ture.
It has to be you, it has to be yourself.	Si ta'uu qaba, ofii kee ta'uu qaba.
He'll be fine.	Inni gaarii ta'a.
I didn't know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture.
I am pretty sure this should work for you.	Kun siif hojjechuu akka qabu mirkanaa'aa dha.
A lot had happened.	Waan baay'een ta'ee ture.
Maybe they will help.	Tarii ni gargaaru ta'a.
He took the big one.	Inni guddaa fudhate.
I knew nothing better	Kana caalaa homaa hin beeku ture
I was sure, it had been someone else	Ani mirkanaa'aa ture, nama biraa ta'ee ture
It all seems to be working.	Hundi isaa waan hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
Those who have money.	Warra qarshii qaban sun.
There was no reason for it.	Sababni itti ta'u hin turre.
That it could be the only one.	Isa qofa ta'uu akka danda'u.
He won't go without me.	Ana malee hin deemu.
I was in him, we were one	Ani isa keessa ture, tokko turre
Eating and playing.	Nyaachuu fi taphachuu.
I know there’s more to it than that	Kana caalaa akka jiru nan beeka
He knows the way so that shouldn't be a problem	Karaa beeka kanaaf sun rakkoo ta'uu hin qabu
It's not too bad.	Baay'ee hamaa miti.
But it was what she said.	Garuu waan isheen jette ture.
I think she is so good at her job	Hojii ishee irratti akka malee waan ga'umsa qabdu natti fakkaata
After a while he came to my car door	Yeroo muraasa booda gara balbala konkolaataa kootti dhufe
I just want one, but I can't have her	Tokko qofa barbaada, garuu ishee qabaachuu hin danda'u
Not just me, but you.	Ana qofa osoo hin taane si.
That's the only thing.	Waan sana qofa.
It can't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin danda'u.
It was always there.	Yeroo hunda ture.
He wanted to scream, but he couldn’t.	Iyyuu barbaade, garuu hin dandeenye.
I mean, we were going to go	Deemuuf turre jechuu kooti
I always doubted the father	Yeroo hundumaa abbaa sana nan shakka ture
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
It started a few hours ago	Sa'aatii muraasa dura jalqabe
They are going to do it.	Itti deemaa jiru.
I know what she wants to do	Waan isheen gochuu barbaaddu nan beeka
He was not alone in this.	Kana keessatti inni kophaa isaa hin turre.
We wanted to meet her.	Ishee waliin wal arguu barbaanne.
This is absolutely correct.	Kun guutummaatti sirrii dha.
No questions please.	Gaaffii hin qabu maaloo.
To become a teacher.	Barsiisaa ta'uuf.
I thought it would be a good way	Karaa gaarii ta'a jedheen yaade
I couldn’t find anyone	Nama tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
The reason should be obvious.	Sababni isaa ifa ta'uu qaba.
I saw that this was going to be so	Kun akkas ta'uuf akka jiru arge
He must always tell the truth	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa dubbachuu qaba
Two are dangerous.	Lama balaa qaba.
I just couldn’t leave you	Si dhiisuu qofa hin dandeenye
But that’s what makes it so important.	Garuu kan akka malee barbaachisaa isa godhu kanuma.
I knew this was coming.	Kun akka dhufu nan beeka ture.
But I knew what he meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaade garuu nan beeka ture
That’s the whole problem.	Rakkoon jiru hundi kanuma.
You don’t have to do that.	Ati akkas gochuu hin qabdu.
I still don't know.	Ammallee hin beeku.
I'm on it now	Ani amma irra ta'e
Still there was none.	Ammas tokkollee hin turre.
This is the important one.	Kun isa barbaachisaa dha.
I know it was.	Akka ture nan beeka.
But not with this one.	Garuu isa kana waliin miti.
That is not the case.	Sun akkas miti.
I have nothing left.	Kana booda homaa hin qabu.
He would go again.	Ammas ni deema ture.
What is this from	Maal irraa kun .
I just need clothes to stay home	Mana turuuf uffata qofa na barbaachisa
I told him what had happened	Waan ta'e itti hime
There are many of us.	Baay'ee keenya jirra.
I saw him but he didn’t see me	Ani isa arge malee inni na hin argine
I didn't see any of them for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf isaan keessaa tokkollee hin argine.
I didn't know why then, why.	Yeroo sana maaliif, maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
To do this, we need exactly two things.	Kana gochuuf sirriitti waan lama nu barbaachisa.
That’s what it was.	Kanuma ture.
I love it so much.	Ani baay'een jaalladha.
I can't think of it.	Yaadu hin danda'u.
No one wants to talk about it.	Namni waa'ee isaa dubbachuu barbaadu hin jiru.
He made that clear.	Sana ifa godhe.
He had said it.	Jedhee ture.
I’m glad I lived in the area for so long.	Yeroo dheeraaf naannoo sana jiraachuu kootti gammadeera.
But it looked good.	Garuu gaarii fakkaata ture.
You.	Ati.
If it is necessary.	Yoo dirqama ta'e.
I didn't see it.	Ani hin argine.
It was not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin turre.
He didn’t leave after two years	Waggaa lama booda hin deemne
What could be the reason.	Sababni isaa maal ta'uu danda'a.
That's it.	Kanuma.
They are doing some good things.	Waan gaarii tokko tokko hojjechaa jiru.
I really do, you know.	Dhuguma nan godha, beekta.
It was me who didn’t understand	Kan hin hubanne ana ture
Both men are in hand.	Namoonni lamaan harka keessa jiru.
I want to play in one	Tokko keessatti taphachuu barbaada
He had got it too well.	Garmalee akka gaariitti argate ture.
I think you just said that	Ati akkas jettee qofa natti fakkaata
I don't know how it happened	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku
I could help you with that	Sana irratti si gargaaruu nan danda'a ture
I love those things.	Wantoota sana nan jaalladha.
Hopefully this will work.	Kun akka hojjetu abdii qabna.
He told me when he was in me.	Yeroo na keessa jiru natti hime.
He said nothing more	Kana caalaa homaa hin dubbanne
He falls in love with her quickly	Dafee ishee jaallata
It all looked good.	Hundi isaa gaarii fakkaata ture.
I didn’t tell anyone anything	Ani homaa namatti hin himne
I'm about me now.	Ani amma waa'ee kooti.
We told the truth.	Dhugaa dubbanne.
He was still waiting.	Ammas eegaa ture.
I think he still loves her	Ammallee waan ishee jaallatu natti fakkaata
He told me that.	Akkas natti hime.
I love everyone.	Nama hunda nan jaalladha.
Just as simple as that.	Akkuma salphaa sana.
No one has spoken.	Namni dubbate hin jiru.
It was very extreme	Baayyee garmalee ture
I think he’s had the worst luck ever	Carraa hamaa hanga ammaatti argate natti fakkaata
At the time, however, this was not so obvious.	Yeroo sanatti garuu kun hangas ifa hin turre.
I should probably go home	Ani tarii gara manaatti deebi'uu qaba
It’s long and wide.	Dheeraa fi bal’aa dha.
Looking for something similar on this car	Konkolaataa kana irratti waan wal fakkaatu barbaada
I have no idea who it was	Eenyu akka ture yaada hin qabu
There is nothing he is looking for.	Wanti inni barbaadaa jiru hin jiru.
I think that's it.	Kana natti fakkaata.
You can have what you need.	Waan si barbaachisu qabaachuu dandeessa.
He says you are going to be fine.	Ati gaarii ta'uuf jirta jedha.
That was really important to us.	Sun dhuguma nuuf barbaachisaa ture.
Maybe someone was there.	Tarii namni tokko achi ture ta'a.
That took some time.	Sun yeroo fudhate.
He told me about you.	Waa'ee kee natti hime.
They work together in the same room.	Kutaa tokko keessatti waliin hojjetu.
Like, a whole lot more.	Akka, guutummaatti baay'ee caalaa.
I have no idea how it works	Akkamitti akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu
I couldn’t see what it looked like	Maal akka fakkaatu arguu hin dandeenye
I don’t like these people	Namoota kana hin jaalladhu
We had a job.	Hojii qabna turre.
I would have made a good wife to someone.	Silaa nama tokko haadha manaa gaarii nan godha ture.
Way so quickly.	Karaa akkas dafee.
I hadn't really said much.	Dhuguma baay'ee hin dubbanne ture.
Maybe it's probably.	Tarii ta'uu hin oolu.
I’ve never been on one before	Kana dura tokko irra turee hin beeku
He had something to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu qaba ture.
It seems to be very similar.	Baayyee waan wal fakkaatu fakkaata.
John understood this.	Joon kana hubate.
I thought you were a dog	Ati saree natti fakkaate
I always wanted to do more	Yeroo hundumaa kana caalaa hojjechuu nan barbaada ture
That's more of it.	Caalaatti kanuma.
But no one said you can’t do this.	Garuu namni kana gochuu hin dandeessu jedhe hin jiru.
He’s long gone.	Inni yeroo dheeraaf hin jiru.
But I don't know anything.	Garuu homaa hin beeku.
There is no one in there	Nama tokkollee achi keessa hin jiru
In my room.	Kutaa koo keessatti.
I know you still have problems with me	Ammallee na waliin rakkoo akka qabdu nan beeka
You can't give it to me.	Naaf kennuu hin dandeessu.
I wanted to know what he was doing	Waan inni hojjetu beekuu barbaade
I knew him, I don’t do this	Ani isa beeka ture, kana hin godhu
I didn’t quite know what to do	Maal akkan godhu sirriitti hin beeku ture
I mean, it just doesn’t have a voice.	Sagalee qofa hin qabu jechuu kooti.
Then a long drive home.	Sana booda konkolaataa dheeraa gara manaatti.
I hope it never happens	Yoomiyyuu akka hin taane abdiin qaba
I can't believe you are	Akka taate amanuu hin danda'u
He must have been waiting for her.	Ishee eegaa ture ta'uu qaba.
We did that one night.	Halkan tokko akkas goone.
It was pretty clear this afternoon.	Har'a waaree booda baayyee ifa ta'ee ture.
Probably a long time.	Tarii yeroo dheeraa ta'uu hin oolu.
But I didn't tell him that	Ani garuu kana itti hin himne
They were looking for them.	Isaan barbaadaa turan.
This is not happening.	Kun ta'aa hin jiru.
I wanted to know a little bit about how that happened	Akkamitti akkas ta'e xiqqoo beekuu barbaade
She can’t see it, of course.	Isheen arguu hin dandeessu, beekamaadha.
But then, can you tell me .	Garuu sana booda, natti himuu dandeessaa .
I really wanted to go.	Ani baay'een deemuu barbaade.
I don't know why, but it was	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu akkas ture
I was just going to a party	Affeerraa tokko qofa deemaa ture
But you can’t have my house.	Garuu mana koo qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
That doesn’t help.	Sun hin gargaaru.
I know he wants to play	Taphachuu akka barbaadu nan beeka
She wasn't doing this now.	Amma kana hin gochaa turte.
But there is still time.	Garuu ammas yeroon jira.
I still love you so much	Ammallee baay'een si jaalladha
This never happened.	Kun gonkumaa ta'ee hin beeku.
I had no idea that was the case	Akkas akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
The timing must be right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii ta'uu qaba.
I thought there would be time	Yeroon ni jira jedheen yaade
I think you will like them	Isaan ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
People well there.	Namoonni akka gaariitti achitti.
This is not your business.	Kun dhimma keessan miti.
We’re all in here.	Hundi keenya as keessa jirra.
But it's just too much of a good thing for us.	Garuu nuuf waan gaarii garmalee ta'uu qofa.
But there is a problem with this.	Garuu kana irratti rakkoon jira.
He wanted to go back	Duubatti deebi'uu barbaade
It seems to be a problem.	Rakkoo waan ta'e fakkaata.
Not a mother.	Haadha miti.
Everything was right	Waan hundumaa sirrii ture
It’s still in my hands.	Ammallee harka koo keessa jira.
I love you more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa si jaalladha
That person is ourselves.	Namni sun ofii keenya.
They are inside me.	Isaan keessa koo jiru.
I want to do the right thing	Waan sirrii ta'e hojjechuu nan barbaada
You can do this, you know.	Kana gochuu dandeessa, beekta.
He gave me everything.	Waan hundumaa naaf kenne.
You're right about that.	Waa'ee kanaa sirrii dha.
I just thought you need to know, that’s all	Ani beekuu qabdu qofa jedheen yaade, kana qofa
He had no reason to do it.	Sababni itti godhu hin qabu ture.
I always wanted to be alone	Yeroo hundumaa kophaa koo taʼuu nan barbaada ture
I always wanted to be with him more	Yeroo hundumaa caalaatti isa wajjin taʼuu nan barbaada ture
This whole time.	Yeroo kana guutuu.
He should have done this a long time ago	Silaa kana yeroo dheeraa dura gochuu qaba ture
You have no idea it is happening.	Ta'aa jiraachuu isaa yaada hin qabdu.
I just have to go somewhere else	Bakka biraa deemuu qofa qaba
That's all that happened.	Sun hundi ta'e.
But I told him this was different.	Garuu wanti kun adda ta'uu itti hime.
We were just people here.	Asitti namoota qofa turre.
He wasn't sure if he believed it.	Inni amanuu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
He can do almost anything he wants.	Waan barbaade hunda jechuun ni danda'ama.
You’re making it work.	Akka hojjetu gochaa jirta.
Some girl with a problem.	Intala tokko tokko rakkoo qabdu.
It would have been nice.	Silaa gaarii ture.
I had the same reaction.	Anis deebii wal fakkaatu qaba ture.
I could never leave all my friends here	Hiriyyoota koo hunda asitti dhiisuu gonkumaa hin dandeenye
I still hadn't really seen her today	Har'a ammallee dhuguma ishee hin argine ture
Maybe three times.	Tarii yeroo sadii.
I hope we can see more of this	Kana caalaa arguu akka dandeenyu abdiin qaba
It doesn't happen any more out here.	As ala kana caalaa hin ta'u.
He didn’t want to be in his shoes	Kophee isaa keessa jiraachuu hin barbaadu ture
He can do whatever he wants.	Waan barbaade gochuu dandaʼa.
I can't have this in my house	Kana mana koo keessatti qabaachuu hin danda'u
But it is, so it should be.	Garuu ni jira, kanaaf ta'uu qaba.
He should have come sooner	Silaa dafee dhufuu qaba ture
There’s just none for us.	Tokkollee nuuf hin jiru qofa.
I know very little.	Baayyee xiqqoo beeka.
He is just that good.	Inni akkas qofa gaarii dha.
I didn’t want any of it.	Ani tokkollee hin barbaanne.
The obvious answer.	Deebii ifa ta'e.
I wasn't watching much	Baay'ee ilaalaa hin turre
I have you in my room	Kutaa koo keessa si qaba
I don't know what it will be, but there has to be something.	Maal akka ta'u hin beeku, garuu waan tokko jiraachuu qaba.
I know you really do like him	Dhuguma akka isaa akka gootu nan beeka
I just can't seem to find the right one	Kan sirrii ta'e qofa waanan argachuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata
Perhaps that is true.	Tarii sun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
There was hope.	Abdiin ture.
I hope it comes soon	Yeroo dhiyootti akka dhufu abdiin qaba
I was going too.	Anis deemaa ture.
It's a little bit like that.	Xiqqoo akkas ta'a.
That it was.	Akka ture.
I doubt he made it through the night	Halkan keessa akka darbe nan shakka
I couldn't say it	Jechuu hin dandeenye
Probably too soon.	Tarii dafee ta'uu hin oolu.
I don’t understand any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee naaf hin galle
Which is really good.	Kan dhuguma gaarii dha.
I am well pleased with myself	Ofii kootti akka gaariitti gammadeera
I’m not sure if that’s possible.	Sun ni danda’ama ta’uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa’aa miti.
I couldn’t believe what he just said	Waan amma jedhe amanuu hin dandeenye
I want to be with you for a long time	Yeroo dheeraa si waliin ta'uu barbaada
From being funny to	Qoosaa ta'uu irraa gara
I was waiting for him	Anis isa eegaa ture
It would have worked.	Silaa ni hojjeta ture.
I still know it.	Ammallee nan beeka.
That was my father.	Sun abbaa koo ture.
Is there a job around?.	Hojii naannoo jiru jiraa?.
I can be honest about that	Waa'ee sanaa dhugaa dubbachuu nan danda'a
I can't leave her now	Amma ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u
It must be one.	Tokko ta'uu qaba.
I just didn't know if it was true or not	Dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa qofa hin beeku ture
I thought about her a lot	Waa'ee ishee baay'een yaade
I didn’t see it, but it was obvious that she had	Ani hin argine, garuu akka qabdu ifa ture
I don't really know why anymore	Kana booda maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku
I want to ask what that means	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e gaafachuu barbaada
She certainly knew them.	Isheen akka isaan beektu beekamaadha.
He’s been doing that for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas gochaa ture
It wasn’t until a couple of years later	Waggaa lama lama booda hin turre
Without a place.	Bakka hin qabne.
It can’t be any other.	Kan biraa ta’uu hin danda’u.
What do you look like.	Maal fakkaattu.
But you can never be like us.	Garuu gonkumaa akka keenya ta'uu hin dandeessu.
I think they might be very interested	Baay'ee fedhii qabaachuu danda'u jedheen yaada
I don't even know what it is exactly	Sirriitti maal akka ta'e illee hin beeku
It's the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e.
I don’t want you to think so.	Akka ati yaaddu hin barbaadu.
He didn’t want anyone else	Nama biraa hin barbaadu ture
I like that better	Sana caalaatti natti tola
I hesitated for a moment and looked around	Yeroo muraasaaf duubatti jedheen naannoo koo ilaale
I know about this stuff	Waa'ee waan kanaa nan beeka
Not a little bit this time.	Yeroo kana xiqqoo xiqqoo miti.
I couldn't see much.	Waan baay'ee arguu hin dandeenye.
I never understood how	Akkamitti akka ta'e gonkumaa naaf hin galle ture
I know this is not enough	Kun gahaa akka hin taane nan beeka
It can even be dangerous.	Balaa illee ta’uu danda’a.
Age, of course, is a factor.	Umuriin, waan tokko akka taʼe beekamaadha.
I’m not that interested.	Ani akkasitti fedhii hin qabu.
I know a lot of what it's like.	Maal akka fakkaatu baay'een beeka.
I didn't think about it	Ani itti hin yaadne
Life is life is life.	Jireenya jireenya jireenya.
The problem is people.	Rakkoon jiru namoota.
I don’t like them.	Ani isaan hin jaalladhu.
I didn't know what that was	Sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I hoped he could	Inni akka danda'u abdiin qaba ture
It just doesn’t work that way.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu qofa.
He wasn’t there yet.	Ammallee achi hin turre.
I never wanted to go	Ani gonkumaa deemuu hin barbaadu ture
We are now.	Amma jirra.
We just have it.	Nuti qofa qabna.
Sometimes he did what he had to do.	Yeroo tokko tokko waan gochuu qabu hojjeta ture.
He didn’t seem to know what to say.	Waan jedhu waan hin beekne fakkaata ture.
There must be so much more to it than that.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee qabaachuu qaba.
It’s not a good feeling.	Miira gaarii miti.
I just didn't want to talk about	Waa'ee dubbachuu qofa hin barbaanne
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
It's never good.	Gonkumaa gaarii miti.
It doesn't seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu.
I am so happy to have them in our lives	Jireenya keenya keessatti isaan qabaachuu kootti baay'een gammade
I didn’t see where to do it	Eessa akkan godhu hin argine
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
A big, tall man	Nama guddaa fi dheeraa
I suspect, however, that it doesn’t matter	Ani garuu, dhimma hin qabu jedheen shakka
It was a long day.	Guyyaa dheeraa ture.
Room, where he found it.	Kutaa, bakka inni itti argate.
Not in here.	As keessaa miti.
You don't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabdu.
I didn’t want any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne
This one was the one.	Inni kun ture.
I have no desire to speak anymore	Kana booda fedhii dubbachuu hin qabu
None of them spoke to each other.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee wal hin dubbanne.
My job is to	Hojiin koo .
She didn’t need anyone else.	Nama biraa ishee hin barbaachifne.
He couldn't see me.	Na arguu hin dandeenye.
It's very likely that someone will.	Namni tokko akka ta'u baay'ee hin oolu.
He has a place to go	Bakka itti deemu qaba
If not, that’s your problem.	Yoo hin taane rakkoon kee kanuma.
I can see him right	Ani sirriitti isa arguu nan danda'a
I was the worst in the room	Ani kutaa sana keessatti isa hamaa ture
She should have been.	Silaa ta'uu qabdi turte.
I didn’t know the girl	Intala sana hin beeku ture
I'm not sure, really	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti, dhuguma
I have to do this sometime	Yeroo tokko kana gochuun qaba
But nothing happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e hin jiru.
But there's still something about them that you love.	Garuu ammallee waa'ee isaanii wanti ati jaallattu jira.
We have very good money to buy.	Maallaqa baayyee gaarii bitachuu dandeenyu qabna.
These people were right.	Namoonni kun sirrii turan.
But she’s not the only one.	Garuu ishee qofa miti.
I have a little problem	Xiqqoo rakkoon qaba
He had to help me.	Na gargaaruu qaba ture.
I know who they were before all this	Kana hunda dura eenyu akka turan nan beeka
More.	Caalaa.
I love you so, so, so much	Baay'een, baay'een, baay'een si jaalladha
They look pretty great.	Isaan baayyee guddaa fakkaatu.
I can make you anything you want to be	Waan ta'uu barbaaddu hunda si gochuu nan danda'a
I love every bit of it	Xiqqoo isaa hunda nan jaalladha
Nothing more was needed.	Kana caalaa wanti barbaachisu hin turre.
But now we have to go further.	Amma garuu kana caalaa deemuu qabna.
I can't leave you with him anymore	Kana booda isa bira si dhiisuu hin danda'u
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
Not just one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa miti.
I haven't thought much about it yet	Hanga ammaatti baay'ee itti hin yaadne
All she needed was to see this.	Wanti ishee barbaachisu kana arguu qofa ture.
Today that person is me.	Har'a namni sun ana.
Right after that.	Isa booda sirriitti.
I didn't really care though	Ani garuu baay'ee dhimma hin qabu ture
I was pretty sure he was wrong.	Dogoggora akka qabu baay'een mirkanaa'aa ture.
You are possible.	Ati ni danda'ama.
I shouldn’t do this to her.	Kana ishee irratti gochuu hin qabu.
A lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee.
I thought maybe it was good	Tarii gaarii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
I love you both so much	Isin lamaan baay'een jaalladha
Not the same dog.	Saree wal fakkaatu miti.
Sometimes it's just great, I know it can be too much.	Yeroo tokko tokko guddaa ta'uu qofa, garmalee ta'uu akka danda'u nan beeka.
Not really, though.	Dhuguma miti malee.
As you have before.	Akkuma kanaan dura qabdu.
I know this guy a lot	Gurbaa kana baay'een beeku
He had nothing.	Homaa hin qabu ture.
I knew you wanted me	Akka ati na barbaaddu nan beeka ture
This is one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko.
I thought he was doing pretty well	Baayyee gaarii waan hojjechaa jiru natti fakkaate
Same time next year, same place.	Bara dhufu yeroo wal fakkaatu, bakka wal fakkaatu.
I think it's the right thing to do	Ani waan sirrii ta'e natti fakkaata
He's just happened.	Inni amma ta'e.
I couldn’t tell you before	Kana dura sitti himuu hin dandeenye
No one even seemed to notice.	Namni illee waan hubate hin fakkaatu ture.
But my father.	Garuu abbaa koo.
He must have her.	Ishee qabaachuu qaba.
He should have bought them all	Silaa hunda isaanii bitachuu qaba ture
I was as good as it went	Ani akkuma deeme gaarii ture
I saw her, she was with someone	Ishee arge, nama tokko waliin turte
I probably was, too.	Anis taʼuu hin oolu.
I really love you.	Dhuguma si jaalladha.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
I don't know about it.	Ani waa'ee isaa hin beeku.
He didn't tell us anything different.	Waan adda ta'e nutti hin himne.
A lot of things happen	Wanti baay'een ni ta'a
He didn’t do well.	Inni gaarii hin hojjenne.
I love it when that happens	Yeroo sun ta'u baay'een jaalladha
I think you need sleep	Hirriba si barbaachisa jedheen yaada
This was something else.	Kun waan biraa ture.
That was it.	Sana ture.
But some things were clear.	Garuu wanti tokko tokko ifa ture.
That’s going to be obvious.	Sun ifa ta’a.
I don't know any of them	Ani tokkollee hin beeku
I had no qualifications at the time.	Yeroo sanatti ga'umsa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I’m not important anymore	Kana booda ani barbaachisaa miti
I'm not going to school tomorrow	Boru mana barumsaa hin deemu
I said it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti jedheen ture.
It's going to be great	Guddaa ta'uuf deema
She says, 'It's.	Isheen jedha.
I couldn’t see her.	Ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
I can't be that person	Ani nama sana ta'uu hin danda'u
We can’t find anything else.	Waan biraa argachuu hin dandeenyu.
But I can't do it.	Garuu gochuu hin danda'u.
We have to get it.	Argachuu qabna.
We can’t leave him up there.	Achitti ol isa dhiisuu hin dandeenyu.
I've never been like that	Ani akkas ta'ee hin beeku
It’s not a problem.	Rakkoo miti.
I couldn’t meet his eyes	Ija isaa waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye
I will make it happen	Ani akka ta'u nan godha
But you need money to do that.	Garuu sana gochuuf qarshii si barbaachisa.
When she was human, she was a mother.	Yeroo nama turte haadha turte.
I know it has to be.	Akka ta'uu qabu nan beeka.
But she didn't want to.	Isheen garuu hin barbaanne.
That's not happening.	Sun ta'aa hin jiru.
What a man.	Maal nama.
I could be wrong though.	Ani garuu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
I think that would be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'a jedheen yaada.
I know you’re in there	Achi keessa akka jirtu nan beeka
I know this is not easy for you	Kun siif salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
I am none of those things	Ani wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee miti
I can’t seem to find it.	Ani waanan argachuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
Everything is right.	Wanti hundi sirrii dha.
I want to know who you are	Eenyu akka taate beekuu barbaada
I want you with me.	Ana waliin si barbaada.
That’s very possibly true.	Sun baay’ee ta’uu danda’a dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
It was a lot.	Baay'ee ture.
It may not be something everyone has.	Tarii waan namni hundi qabu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
You don't have to come here.	As dhufuu hin qabdu.
If it should be.	Yoo ta'uu qaba.
No one had ever seen me	Namni na arge hin beeku ture
They should be good.	Gaarii ta'uu qabu.
We didn't meet.	Wal hin argine.
I already know the answer	Deebii isaa duruu beeka
Available.	Jira.
I didn't want to be hopeful.	Abdii qabaachuu hin barbaanne ture.
I have to go now.	Amma deemuun qaba.
But that's about like.	Garuu sun waa'ee akka.
I said I had no chance	Carraa hin qabu jedheen

Everything is possible!.	Wanti hundi ni danda'ama!.

So far everything has been good so far.	Hanga ammaatti wanti hundi hanga ammaatti gaarii ture.

It just has to be.	Ta'uu qofa qaba.
I can do it often	Yeroo baayyee hojjechuu nan danda'a
He said he had to go, he had to go.	Deemu qaba, deemuu qaba jedhe.
One day, without problems	Guyyaa tokko, rakkoo malee
I wanted everything he could give me.	Waan inni naaf kennuu dandaʼu hunda nan barbaada ture.
Who looked at the whole and that.	Eenyu guutuu fi sana ilaale.
Many of them already love you.	Baay'een isaanii duruu si jaallatu.
I think he's a good man	Nama gaarii natti fakkaata
I want to be her.	Ani ishee ta'uu barbaada.
But it’s just not that funny	Garuu akkas qoosaa miti qofa
He was trying to help her	Ishee gargaaruuf yaalaa ture
But when he could, I knew he would	Yeroo danda'u garuu akka godhu nan beeka ture
There is nothing in it.	Wanti keessa hin jiru.
You don't want to talk about these things.	Waa'ee wantoota kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaaddu.
He doesn’t want any of it.	Inni tokkollee hin barbaadu.
I can do so much more	Kana caalaa baayʼee hojjechuu nan dandaʼa
One day, he left.	Guyyaa tokko, deeme.
No one wanted to know	Namni beekuu barbaade hin jiru
We did a little work on your case.	Dhimma keessan irratti hojii xiqqoo hojjenne.
Everyone but you.	Si malee hunda.
I wanted to go, too.	Anis deemuu barbaade.
I have nothing to do	Ani waanan godhu hin qabu
Everything is different then.	Yeroo sanatti wanti hundi adda adda.
But I didn’t want to comment like that.	Garuu akkas yaada kennuu hin barbaanne.
But that was three weeks ago.	Garuu sun torban sadii dura ture.
I just didn’t tell you the whole truth.	Dhugaa guutuu qofa sitti hin himne.

I want to do some.	Tokko tokko hojjechuu barbaada.
She had to get some.	Tokko tokko argachuu qabdi turte.
He doesn't like it.	Inni hin jaallatu.
He can still be that person.	Ammas nama sana ta'uu danda'a.
I enjoyed it in there	Achi keessa itti gammade
Can’t find what you want?.	Waan barbaaddu argachuu hin dandeenye?.
I know this happens very rarely, if ever.	Kun baayyee yeroo muraasaaf akka ta'e nan beeka, yoo ta'e illee.
I want this as badly as you do	Anis kana akkuma keessan hamaa barbaada
Everything would have been bad.	Silaa wanti hundi hamaa ta'a ture.
He certainly knows all the answers.	Deebii hunda akka beeku beekamaadha.

I hope all goes well	Hundi akka gaariitti akka deemu abdiin qaba
He was just doing it with his voice	Sagalee isaatiin qofa hojjechaa ture
Maybe that's the way it is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a.
But never mine is as good as his.	Garuu gonkumaa kan koo akka isaa gaarii miti.
I just didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e qofa hin beeku ture.
I can't do anything else	Waan biraa hojjechuu hin danda'u
I didn’t want to play anymore.	Kana booda taphachuu hin barbaanne.
But I know that you know.	Akka ati garuu akka beektu nan beeka.
Together they are so neat.	Waliin akkasitti sirrii dha.
So he’s on it.	Kanaaf inni irra jira.
There was a time when he stood out.	Yeroon inni adda ta'e tokko ture.
I doubt anyone would.	Namni akkas godhu nan shakka.
I love your language.	Afaan kee nan jaalladha.
I really wanted that one	Isa sana baay'een barbaade
They look so great with everything.	Waan hundumaa wajjin baayyee guddaa fakkaatu.
I passed them the day before	Guyyaa tokko dura isaan bira darbe
There were many of them.	Isaan baay'ee turan.
It can't last long, though	Yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u garuu
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
There is nothing we can do right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.

She’s not in there yet.	Ammallee achi keessa hin jirtu.
He didn’t tell me anything for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf homaa natti hin himne.
He asked her to go with him.	Isa waliin akka deemtu ishee gaafate.
That girl, who has no name.	Intala sana, kan maqaa hin qabne.
I couldn’t be in the same room as her	Kutaa ishee wajjin tokko keessa jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I thought I’d rather never say their names	Maqaa isaanii gonkumaa hin dubbanne naaf wayya jedheen yaade
I didn’t see her do that.	Isheen akkas gootu hin argine.
It seemed to work well.	Akka gaariitti waan hojjetu fakkaata ture.
That he doesn't.	Akka inni hin goone.
It was always true.	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa ture.
You are doing a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjechaa jirta.

I can't go without them	Isaan malee deemuu hin danda'u
We’re all human here.	Hundi keenya asitti nama.
It was bad in there.	Achi keessa hamaa ture.
He didn’t know me.	Inni na hin beeku ture.
But I still wasn't sure that was the case.	Garuu ammallee akkas ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I know what you are.	Maal akka taate nan beeka.
It really looks like forgiveness.	Dhuguma dhiifama fakkaata.
Love me a little, love me long.	Xiqqoo na jaalladhu, yeroo dheeraa na jaalladhu.
Everything works fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
So I would never forgive him	Kanaaf gonkumaa dhiifama hin godhu ture
It has a lot of things	Waan baay'ee qaba
I know you will never understand	Yoomiyyuu akka hin hubanne nan beeka
That’s one of our problems.	Rakkoo keenya keessaa tokko kanuma.
This sounds good, but it doesn’t work.	Kun gaarii fakkaata, garuu hin hojjetu.
I like that, if anything.	Sana natti tola, yoo wanti tokko ta'e.
He looked at the place	Bakka sana ilaale
I don't want to see anything.	Ani homaa arguu hin barbaadu.
I was making a lot of mistakes	Dogoggora baay'ee hojjechaa ture
He just told me what he wanted me to do.	Waan akkan godhu barbaadu qofa natti hime.
Boston and back.	Boston fi deebi'uu.
He wants something different	Waan adda ta'e barbaada
Then he looked around.	Sana booda naannoo isaa ilaale.
I was really alone right now	Yeroo ammaa kana dhuguma kophaa koo ture
I still don’t feel good about myself	Ammallee ofitti miira gaarii hin qabu
Glad I had him come with us	Nu waliin akka dhufu gochuu kootti gammadeera
They were really good.	Dhuguma gaarii turan.
What he thought.	Waan itti fakkaate.
There was no other work.	Hojiin biraa hin turre.
She wasn’t working.	Isheen hojjechaa hin turre.
I hadn’t met him before	Kanaan dura isa waliin wal hin argine ture
I was happy with that.	Sanatti gammade.
I have issues with them.	Ani dhimma isaan irratti qaba.
It wasn’t a problem	Rakkoon hin qabu ture
I couldn’t do anything good.	Homaa gaarii gochuu hin dandeenye.
We don’t have food.	Nyaata hin qabnu.
He’d never say good or bad.	Gaarii ta’ee hamaa ta’ee gonkumaa hin jedhu ture.
I thought she was into all of this	Kana hunda keessa waan jirtu natti fakkaate
I wouldn’t go to them	Silaa isaan bira hin deemu ture
You never understood what it was like.	Maal akka fakkaatu tasumaa siif hin galle.
I don’t mean for any of this to happen	Kana keessaa tokkollee akka ta’u jechuu koo miti
I have to ask a lot of questions	Gaaffii baay'ee gaafachuu qaba
Which was good for me.	Kan naaf gaarii ture.
A lot of times.	Yeroo baayyee baay'ee.
I do this all the time	Yeroo hundumaa kana nan godha
One of the many didn't want to be another	Baay'ee isaa keessaa tokko kan biraa ta'uu hin barbaanne
I want to know how he was treating you	Akkamitti akka si ilaalaa ture beekuu barbaada
That was a mistake, a complete mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture, dogoggora guutuu ture.
I just didn't want to know about it.	Waa'ee isaa beekuu qofa hin barbaanne.
It is not necessary right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana barbaachisaa miti.
I hadn't thought about it until now	Hanga ammaatti waa'ee isaa hin yaadne ture
One is going to be for you.	Tokko siif ta'uuf deema.
This is our life.	Jireenya keenya kana.
He had high hopes for this one	Isa kana irratti abdii guddaa qaba ture
I had to do that	Ani akkas gochuun qaba ture
It was no problem at all	Tasumaa rakkoo hin qabu ture
I knew him very well.	Baay'ee isa beeka ture.
I have hope.	Abdiin qaba.
Maybe that's what it is.	Tarii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
Of course, I had a lot to do	Waan hojjechuu qabu baayʼee akkan qabu beekamaadha
Chances are they.	Carraan isaan.
You have to ask him.	Isa gaafachuu qabda.
I’m happy with you here	Asitti si waliin gammadeera
I hadn’t even thought of that	Sana illee hin yaadne ture
So I think about it.	Kanaaf itti yaada.
But he has one.	Garuu tokko qaba.
I could have helped him	Silaa isa gargaaruu nan dandaʼa ture
Maybe it's just like you.	Tarii akkuma kee ta'uu danda'a.
I had no idea what it was	Maal akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
Very good idea	Yaada baayyee gaarii ta'e
I could never be with anyone else after him	Isa booda nama biraa wajjin gonkumaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture
It's not a bad thing.	Wanti hamaa miti.
I know what to do with her	Maal akkan ishee godhu nan beeka
He seems like a different person.	Nama adda ta'e fakkaata.
You can live up to three weeks without food.	Nyaata malee hanga torban sadii jiraachuu dandeessa.
She was on duty.	Dirqama irra turte.
He just stared for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ija qofa ilaale.
I was only two years old at the time.	Yeroo sanatti umuriin koo waggaa lama qofa ture.
She still wouldn’t go there.	Ammallee achi hin deemtu turte.
But now I can't.	Amma garuu hin danda'u.
It seemed like a bad idea.	Yaada hamaa fakkaata ture.
I was thinking that.	Ani akkas jedheen yaada ture.
But he said.	Garuu jedhe.
You know him, of course.	Isa ni beektu, beekamaadha.
Willingness to do things better	Wantoota caalaatti hojjechuuf fedhii qabaachuu
He was very much a boy.	Inni baay'ee gurbaa ture.
She doesn't really like being who she is.	Dhuguma eenyu akka taate ta'uu hin jaallattu.
He is extremely good.	Inni garmalee gaarii dha.
I can't say what it was.	Maal akka ture dubbachuu hin danda'u.
But today he had.	Har'a garuu qaba ture.
He may have an idea	Yaada qabaachuu danda'a
So I have no sense	Kanaaf miira hin qabu
A new book.	Kitaaba haaraa.
I can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin danda'u.
But she was fine.	Isheen garuu gaarii turte.
I told him how he could do better.	Akkamitti kana caalaa hojjechuu akka danda'u itti hime.
I didn’t understand it before	Kana dura naaf hin galle ture
He went without a hat	Kophee malee deeme
I know those people.	Namoota sana nan beeka.
She was in here.	Isheen as keessa turte.
He’s really good.	Inni dhuguma gaarii dha.
Unless, of course, that person is you.	Yoo, beekamaadha, namni sun si ta’e malee.
I think that was absolutely true	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa ture jedheen yaada
It used to be different.	Duraan adda ture.
I think she is very nice	Isheen baayyee namatti tola jedheen yaada
But it’s not entirely accurate.	Garuu guutummaatti sirrii miti.
I think someone knows	Namni waan beeku natti fakkaata
He should have known something was wrong right then and there.	Silaa yeroo sanaa fi achitti wanti tokko dogoggora akka jiru beekuu qaba ture.
I like mine.	Kan koo natti tola.
I thought you couldn’t	Hin dandeessu jedheen yaade
You can become a teacher.	Barsiisaa ta'uu dandeessa.
That would have been great.	Silaa sun waan guddaa ture.
All of this is still there next year.	Kun hundi bara dhufu ammallee jira.
But he knew enough.	Garuu waan gahaa beeka ture.
He doesn't like her.	Ishee hin jaallatu.
I thought there must be a reason	Sababni jiraachuu qaba jedheen yaade
I can't tell you what you don't know.	Waan ati hin beekne sitti himuu hin danda'u.
She shouldn’t have to do that.	Isheen akkas gochuu hin qabdu.
He saw what was happening	Waan ta'aa jiru arge
This, he could not do.	Kana, gochuu hin dandeenye.
Language is important.	Afaan barbaachisaa dha.
We’re on it.	Irra jirra.
I had no idea what had come over her	Waan ishee irra dhufe yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
Nothing worse than that.	Kana caalaa wanti hamaa hin ta'u.
You don't mean it.	Jechuu kee miti.
Which is sometimes true.	Kan yeroo tokko tokko dhugaa ta’e.
It will happen.	Ni ta'aa.
They know each other well.	Akka gaariitti wal beeku.
Within a week.	Torban tokko keessatti.
Only about two people	Nama tokko gara lama qofa
Always, always, always nice.	Yeroo hundumaa, yeroo hundumaa, yeroo hundumaa namatti tola.
All she was doing was living her life.	Wanti isheen hojjechaa turte jireenya ishee jiraachuu qofa ture.
I never wanted to know.	Ani gonkumaa beekuu hin barbaanne.
He was that good.	Inni akkas gaarii ture.
He wanted to know why	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaade
I belonged to someone else.	Ani kan nama biraa ture.
I don't know who makes it.	Nama godhu hin beeku.
If someone doesn’t understand, it’s not my problem.	Namni tokko yoo naaf hin galle rakkoo koo miti.
I'm looking for a way.	Karaa nan barbaada.
This was his great opportunity.	Kun carraa isaa guddaa ture.
I mean, just some clothes	Uffata tokko tokko qofa jechuu kooti
I saw two eyes looking at me	Ija lama na ilaalaa jiru arge
It was his, now what happened.	Kan isaa ture, amma maaltu ta'e.
Who knows why.	Maaliif akka ta'e eenyutu beeka.
For a long time it seemed they didn’t need any more.	Yeroo dheeraaf kana caalaa waan isaan hin barbaachifne fakkaata ture.
He had another reason for this.	Kanaaf sababa biraa qaba ture.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin hojjenne.
From the other side of the road.	Karaa biraa irraa.
I could not satisfy your request.	Gaaffii keessan guutuu hin dandeenye.
It should be clear why this is so.	Kun maaliif akka ta’e ifa ta’uu qaba.
I can't quite see it	Ani guutummaatti arguu hin danda'u
I love this book so much	Kitaaba kana baay'een jaalladha
I really want this not to happen.	Kun akka hin taane baay'een barbaada.
I’m just really happy for him.	Dhuguma isaaf qofa gammadeera.
She had everything she needed	Waan ishee barbaachisu hunda qabdi turte
You have to go.	Deemu qabda.
I can never go home now	Amma gonkumaa gara manaatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
I'm kind of a different person now.	Ani amma akka nama adda ta'ee jira.
It was really excellent.	Dhuguma baayyee gaarii ture.
He is currently looking for a job.	Yeroo ammaa hojii barbaadaa jira.
I know it's mine	Kan koo akka ta'e nan beeka
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
All good food, perhaps.	Nyaata gaarii hunda, tarii.
I doubt they exist.	Jiraachuu isaanii nan shakka.
Desire to still hope	Fedhii ammas abdii qabaachuu
I couldn’t find my dog	Saree koo argachuu hin dandeenye
But there is.	Garuu ni jira.
Later, it wasn’t.	Booda, hin turre.
I just need his luck	Carraa isaa qofa na barbaachisa
It was obviously true.	Dhugaa akka ture ifaadha.
They were better than them.	Isaan caalaa turan.
I could make mistakes	Dogoggora hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture
I am nothing and everything	Ani homaa fi waan hundumaa miti
Not sure at the time.	Yeroo sanatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I love it just as much	Anis akkuma kana nan jaalladha
I can't see inside.	Keessaa arguu hin danda'u.
He is not a good man.	Inni nama gaarii miti.
It was still my room there	Ammallee kutaa koo achi ture
Just on my hands.	Harka koo qofa irratti.
Let's see what happened.	Mee ilaalaa waan ta'e.
I can't leave you money	Maallaqa siif dhiisuu hin danda'u
It could have been great.	Silaa guddaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
It’s not really new.	Dhuguma haaraa miti.
He was apparently in relatively easy circumstances.	Inni haala salphaa keessa ture fakkaata.
This had to happen quickly.	Kun dafee ta’uu qaba ture.
They have to buy clothes.	Uffata bitachuu qabu.
But he knew the truth	Dhugaa jiru garuu beeka ture
I don’t want to, I don’t want to	Ani hin barbaadu, hin barbaadu
He knew exactly.	Inni sirriitti beeka ture.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
So it's pretty good.	Kanaaf baay'ee gaarii dha.
I mean, it could have been worse	Silaa kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture jechuu kooti
Everything was new and different.	Wanti hundi haaraa fi adda ture.
There's not much I can do about it.	Waa'ee kanaa wanti ani gochuu danda'u baay'ee hin jiru.
I wonder where that might be	Sun eessa ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
He didn’t say where he was going.	Eessa akka deemu hin dubbanne.
Of course, he could have just stayed with me.	Silaa na bira turuu qofa akka dandaʼu beekamaadha.
I don't mean to say.	Jechuu jechuu koo miti.
But you don't.	Ati garuu hin gootu.
We have a lot to talk about, apparently.	Waa'ee baay'ee dubbachuu qabna, fakkaata.
It happens often.	Yeroo baayyee ni ta'a.
Sounds like you’re on the right track.	Karaa sirrii irra akka jirtu fakkaata.
Maybe we should talk more later.	Tarii booda caalaatti dubbachuu qabna.
They are in the old school.	Mana barumsaa durii keessa jiru.
A different life	Jireenya adda ta'e
I don't want to live.	Ani jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
No one was interested.	Namni fedhii qabu hin turre.
No one thinks anything of it.	Namni homaa itti yaadu hin jiru.
In other words, we are only human.	Kana jechuun nuti namoota qofa.
In work clothes.	Uffata hojii keessatti.
It's not even clear what it is.	Maal akka ta'e illee ifa miti.
I don’t know what more you can ask for.	Kana caalaa maal gaafachuu akka dandeessu hin beeku.
But this was more than a few ways.	Garuu kun karaa muraasa caalaa ture.
That is not the case here.	Asitti akkas miti.
I told myself I wouldn’t.	Hin godhu jedhee ofitti hime.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
I was pretty good at it	Ani irratti baayʼee gaarii ture
There would be someone who would love him.	Silaa namni isa jaallatu ni jiraata.
I couldn't see where	Eessa akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye
The most genuine of things.	Wantoota keessaa isa hunda caalaa dhugaa ta'e.
I know him by his voice	Sagalee isaatiin isa beeka
What is true today was true last week.	Wanti har'a dhugaa ta'e torban darbe dhugaa ture.
I didn’t want to live, anymore	Jiraachuu hin barbaanne, kana booda
No one else said that.	Namni biraa akkas jedhee hin dubbanne.
I wanted to know how it all started	Kun hundi akkamitti akka jalqabe beekuu barbaade
He was there to do the job.	Hojii sana hojjechuuf achi ture.
I know this place well	Bakka kana sirriitti beeka
I just can't stay here	As turuu qofa hin danda'u
I’m not someone you want to know.	Ani nama ati beekuu barbaaddu miti.
He had to eat it	Nyaachuu qaba ture
All day long.	Guyyaa guutuu.
I didn't tell him much about what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru baay'ee itti hin himne
There is a problem, though.	Rakkoon garuu jira.
I hadn’t thought this through	Kana akka gaariitti hin yaadne ture
I had to go every day	Guyyaa hunda deemuun qaba ture
They were good people.	Isaan namoota gaarii turan.
Who knows what might help.	Waan gargaaruu danda'u eenyutu beeka.
No one could quite believe it.	Namni guutummaatti amanuu hin dandeenye.
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
All it takes is twice.	Wanti barbaachisu yeroo lama qofa.
There is no one in the room.	Kutaa keessa namni tokkollee hin jiru.
Wait for me there.	Achitti na eegaa.
He is not at home.	Inni mana hin jiru.
A lot of good that will do you	Gaarii baay'ee kan si godhu
But of course you can.	Garuu beekamaadha akka dandeessu.
That may be important.	Sun barbaachisaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I just couldn’t leave him alone	Kophaa isaa dhiisuu qofa hin dandeenye
I saw that day in her eyes	Guyyaa sana ija ishee keessatti arge
In this house.	Mana kana keessatti.
He thought up again.	Ammas ol jedhee yaade.
I know this voice	Sagalee kana nan beeka
But we’re more than up to the task.	Garuu nuti hojii sanaa caalaa ol jirra.
That would be a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii ta'a.
You can leave it at that.	Akkasitti dhiisuu dandeessa.
Exactly what happened is unclear.	Sirriitti maaltu ta'e ifa miti.
I still shouldn’t ask her	Ammallee ishee gaafachuu hin qabu
I can't do this right now	Yeroo ammaa kana kana gochuu hin danda'u
None of this should happen.	Kun tokkollee ta’uu hin qabu.
I mean, it always works.	Yeroo hundumaa ni hojjeta jechuu kooti.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
There was nothing anyone didn’t want.	Wanti namni tokko hin barbaanne hin turre.
It's not me, it's him.	Ana miti isa.
It’s not just a contemporary thing	Waan yeroo sanaa qofa miti
I thought I’d rather never say their names.	Maqaa isaanii gonkumaa hin dubbanne naaf wayya jedheen yaade.
These are different.	Isaan kun adda adda.
Really, really late.	Dhuguma, dhuguma booda.
She never wanted him.	Isheen gonkumaa isa hin barbaanne.
I know it can do the job for us	Hojii nuuf hojjechuu akka danda'u nan beeka
I hadn't meant for any of it to happen	Isa keessaa tokkollee akka ta'uuf hin yaadne ture
We can’t help it.	Gargaaruu hin dandeenyu.
But for tonight.	Garuu halkan kanaaf.
Now things were going to be different.	Amma wanti jiru adda ta'uuf ture.
It’s not something like that.	Waan akkasii miti.
They should know such things.	Waan akkasii beekuu qabu.
Just like the.	Akkuma.
It just took a very long time.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa qofa fudhate.
Now, you’re in it.	Amma, keessa jirta.
I mean, no one is.	Namni tokkollee hin jiru jechuu kooti.
It was very simple.	Baayyee salphaa ture.
I thought so.	Akkas jedheen yaade.
But he was involved.	Inni garuu harka keessaa qaba ture.
I wasn't sure how to handle this	Kana akkamitti akkan danda'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre
It doesn’t work exactly like that.	Sirriitti akkasitti hin hojjetu.
It could be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
There was no problem.	Rakkoon tokkollee hin turre.
I thought about it, and it happened	Anis itti yaade, ni ta'e
He asked me my name.	Maqaa koo na gaafate.
Not for him.	Isaaf miti.
I think we all have it	Hundi keenya qabna jedheen yaada
In this case, one of two things must happen.	Haala kana keessatti waan lama keessaa tokko ta’uu qaba.
You can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
I know what it is you want	Kan ati barbaaddu maal akka ta'e nan beeka
I didn’t know anything.	Ani homaa hin beeku ture.
I don't know anything about that	Waa'ee sanaa homaa hin beeku
There is no one here, he told her.	Asitti namni hin jiru jedhee itti hime.
Sorry, but you need to go.	Dhiifama garuu deemuun si barbaachisa.
All she wants is her mother.	Wanti isheen barbaaddu haadha ishee qofa.
We were both so lucky	Lamaan keenyayyuu akkas carraa qabna turre
No one could chance to recognize her	Namni tokkollee akka ishee beeku carraa hin dandeenye
I don't understand that.	Sana naaf hin galle.
Not very often.	Yeroo baayyee miti.
She had to go back.	Deebi'uu qabdi turte.
It really doesn't take much	Dhuguma waan baay'een hin barbaachisu
You don't like it.	Hin jaallattu.
I just can't give it to him	Isaaf kennuu qofa hin danda'u
I think this will be good for you	Kun siif gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada
Everyone knows this.	Kana namni hundi ni beeka.
I think it's a good thing.	Waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
Not even that.	Sana illee miti.
I don't have one.	Ani tokko hin qabu.
I can't give you that	Sana siif kennuu hin danda'u
I shouldn’t have told you	Silaa sitti himuu hin qabu ture
I cannot apologize to you enough	Dhiifama gahaa si gaafachuu hin danda'u
More than that, please.	Kana caalaa mee.
In our case.	Keenya keessatti.
Good luck to him.	Carraa gaarii isaaf.
It doesn’t work like that at all.	Tasumaa akkasitti hin hojjetu.
I think I thought it was me.	Ana waan natti fakkaate natti fakkaata.
It's about my money.	Waa'ee maallaqa kooti.
He thought he understood why.	Maaliif akka ta'e waan hubate itti fakkaate.
But it would never come.	Garuu gonkumaa hin dhufu ture.
It was the only job he could get.	Hojii inni argachuu dandaʼu isa qofa ture.
It should be everything in your life	Jireenya kee keessatti waan hundumaa ta'uu qaba
I don’t ever want you to leave	Yoomiyyuu akka ati deemtu hin barbaadu
I know what's going to happen	Waan ta'u nan beeka
He can give him as much money as he wants.	Maallaqa hamma barbaade isaaf kennuu danda'a.
He seemed like a nice guy.	Gurbaa gaarii fakkaata ture.
They couldn’t live together.	Waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
He gave him everything	Waan hundumaa isaaf kenne
But he should have known	Silaa garuu beekuu qaba ture
Keep a close eye on him.	Ija sirriitti isa ilaalaa.
That sounds good.	Sun gaarii fakkaata.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Dogoggora hin turre.
You can’t help some people.	Namoota tokko tokko gargaaruu hin dandeessu.
It’s just not our time, I told myself.	Bara keenya qofa miti jedheen ofitti hime.
You are not quite one of us yet.	Ati ammallee guutummaatti nu keessaa tokko miti.
Maybe he knew.	Tarii beeka ture ta'a.
You couldn’t have known.	Silaa beekuu hin dandeessu turte.
That's the kind of guy he was.	Gurbaa inni akkas ture.
I couldn’t always have my way	Yeroo hundumaa karaa koo qabaachuu hin dandeenye
That’s how it might be.	Akkas ta’uu danda’a.
Tomorrow will be today, today will be yesterday.	Boru har'a ta'a, har'a kaleessa ta'a.
They want us.	Nu barbaadu.
She still needs to know.	Ammas beekuu qabdi.
I wondered what had become of her	Maal ishee ta'e jedheen yaade
Good luck tomorrow.	Boru carraa gaarii.
I could do that much.	Hamma sana gochuu nan dandaʼa ture.
I think you can help me.	Na gargaaruu dandeessu jedheen yaada.
We should have helped each other.	Silaa wal gargaaruu qabna ture.
She was doing well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa turte.
He was a name, of course.	Inni maqaa akka ture beekamaadha.
I think this is his greatest work though.	Kun hojii isaa isa guddaa natti fakkaata garuu.
I thought to myself this would be very, very easy.	Kun baayyee baayyee salphaa ta'a jedheen ofitti yaade.
It can even help .	Illee gargaaruu danda'a .
Can't really do much else	Dhuguma waan biraa baay'ee hojjechuu hin danda'u
I wish this wasn’t the case.	Kun osoo hin taane natti tola.
They are all as bright as daylight.	Hundi isaanii akkuma ifa guyyaa ifaadha.
This was not one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko hin turre.
I have no idea how to do this.	Akkamitti akkan kana godhu yaada hin qabu.
But he didn't do anything like that.	Garuu waan akkasii hin hojjenne.
He shouldn't have done it.	Silaa gochuu hin qabu ture.
I could see you.	Si arguu nan danda'a ture.
Maybe it was this girl, maybe it wasn't.	Tarii intala kana ta'uu danda'a, tarii hin turre ta'a.
I can find another light	Ifa biraa argachuu nan danda'a
Otherwise, absolutely nothing.	Yoo kana hin taane, guutummaatti homaa miti.
You can have more.	Kana caalaa qabaachuu dandeessa.
We have a lot to do here.	Asitti waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabna.
But I knew my mother	Haadha koo garuu nan beeka ture
I wasn't much better than him	Ani baay'ee isa caalaa hin turre
Just two months later.	Ji'a lama qofa booda.
You are still in trouble.	Ammallee rakkoo keessa jirta.
It's so new to me!.	Naaf baay'ee haaraa dha!.
No one would have known.	Silaa namni beeku hin jiru.
The only thing that matters is doing it.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e hojjechuu qofa.
As in man.	Akkuma nama keessatti.
I didn't want to talk about it anymore	Kana booda waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne
Perhaps you do not have what he wants.	Tarii waan inni barbaadu of keessaa hin qabdu taʼa.
I doubt anyone said that	Namni akkas jedhe akka jiru nan shakka
He needs to do something about that soon.	Sana dafee waan tokko gochuu qaba.
More than we need.	Kan nu barbaachisu caalaa.
But everything seemed fine.	Garuu wanti hundi gaarii itti fakkaate.
I thought it really didn’t matter	Dhuguma homaa hin qabu jedheen yaade
That it was.	Akka ture.
Tell me what you don’t know.	Waan hin beekne natti himi.
I do it often.	Yeroo baayʼee nan godha.
He wasn’t like that.	Inni akkas hin turre.
We need to see a lot more.	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee arguu qabna.
That’s what we have to do now.	Amma waan gochuu qabnu kanuma.
What can you give?.	Maal kennuu dandeessa?.
I think it worked out pretty well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee waan hojjete natti fakkaata.
Someone has to say what it is	Namni tokko maal akka ta'e dubbachuu qaba
This is certainly not the case.	Kun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
They would have needed it later.	Silaa booda isaan barbaachisa ture.
I couldn’t find it yesterday	Kaleessa argachuu hin dandeenye
I have to go tonight	Halkan kana deemuun qaba
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I know how it happened	Akkamitti akka ta'e nan beeka
I was sure he wouldn't see me	Akka na hin argine mirkanaa'aa ture
Truck.	Konkolaataa guddaa.
We are clear.	Nuti ifaadha.
I shouldn't have been like that	Ani akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture
It never should have happened.	Gonkumaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I have to do this alone	Kana kophaa koo gochuun qaba
I couldn’t tell my mother	Haadha kootti himuu hin dandeenye
He looked up at her again.	Ammas ol jedhee ishee ilaale.
It was on to something bigger	Waan guddaa caalaa irra ture
She didn't say anything.	Isheen homaa hin dubbanne.
But other than that it was great.	Garuu kanaan ala guddaa ture.
I can't help it.	Ani gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I thought that would be me	Sun ana ta'a jedheen yaade
Didn't do much.	Baay'ee hin hojjenne.
I couldn’t find my car	Konkolaataa koo argachuu hin dandeenye
It can always be if they.	Yeroo hundumaa ta'uu danda'a yoo isaan.
But we didn't.	Nuti garuu hin taane.
I think about her often	Yeroo baayyee waa'ee ishee nan yaada
But this is on the way.	Garuu kun karaa irra jira.
I think you think that	Kana waan yaaddu natti fakkaata
I always liked that about them	Yeroo hundumaa waaʼee isaanii akkas natti tola ture
We had what we wanted.	Waan barbaanne qabna turre.
It seems very likely.	Baay'ee waan ta'uu danda'u fakkaata.
I will do my best to help you	Si gargaaruuf waanan danda'u hunda nan godha
Things were not easy for him.	Wanti isaaf salphaa hin turre.
Hopefully we have nothing in this case.	Haala kana keessatti homaa akka hin qabne abdii qabna.
He just said tonight.	Inni halkan kana qofa jedhe.
They were the only ones.	Isaan qofa turan.
I have two ideas.	Yaada lama qaba.
This seems a bit over the top.	Kun xiqqoo waan ol ta'e fakkaata.
Things are a little different this year.	Bara kana wanti xiqqoo adda.
I’m not like that.	Ani akkas miti.
A long, long time ago, maybe even a good man.	Yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa dura, tarii nama gaarii illee ta’uu danda’a.
What is that?' 	Sun maali?’ jedhee gaafate.
It's in a different room.	Kutaa adda ta'e keessa jira.
He didn’t really tell me anything.	Dhuguma homaa natti hin himne.
Glad to see him again.	Ammas isa arguu kootti gammadeera.
That was someone else’s problem.	Sun rakkoo nama biraa ture.
So maybe it's not his.	Kanaaf tarii kan isaa ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I couldn’t do it anymore	Kana booda gochuu hin dandeenye
A dangerous person in the wrong situation	Nama balaa qabu haala hin taane keessatti
That wasn’t my job.	Sun hojii koo hin turre.
By doing whatever it takes.	Waan barbaachisu hunda gochuudhaan.
You could have had everything.	Silaa waan hundumaa qabaachuu dandeessa turte.
It's always like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'a.
We need to stay up here for a bit.	Xiqqoo as ol turuu qabna.
A long, long time ago	Yeroo dheeraa, yeroo dheeraa dura
I can get back to you later	Booda sitti deebi'uu nan danda'a
Then he saw it was a girl	Yeroo sana intala ta'uu isaa arge
It had to be him.	Isa ta'uu qaba ture.
I would never have been able to go home	Silaa gonkumaa gara manaatti deebi'uu hin danda'u ture
You are doing great.	Guddaa hojjechaa jirtu.
I know he needs it right now	Yeroo ammaa kana akka isa barbaachisu nan beeka
It's not going to happen tomorrow.	Boru ta'uuf hin deemu.
I knew what she was	Maal akka taate nan beeka ture
He is not alone.	Kophaa isaa miti.
Of course, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But I have never been	Ani garuu ta'ee hin beeku
You can go.	Deemtu dandeessa.
It’s just time for him to go.	Yeroon inni itti deemu qofa.
Luck looked back at her.	Carraan duubatti ishee ilaale.
I was something else	Ani waan biraa ture
Everyone but herself.	Ofii ishee malee nama hunda.
I was wrong, of course	Ani dogoggora akkan ture beekamaadha
Which he can't.	Kan inni hin dandeenye.
It wasn’t going unanswered	Deebii malee deemaa hin turre
That’s all and nothing more.	Kana qofa malee kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
Everything else was easy.	Wanti biraa hundi salphaa ture.
It's nice how it turned out.	Akkamitti akka ta'e namatti tola.
I just want you home	Mana qofa si barbaada
But it will happen.	Garuu ni ta'a.
He’s just a guy.	Inni gurbaa qofa.
This feels good.	Kun miira gaarii qaba.
It may be good, it may not be good.	Gaarii ta'uu danda'a, gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u.
It’s not night yet.	Halkan ammallee miti.
There were many of us.	Baay'een keenya turre.
It never seemed like enough.	Gonkumaa waan gahaa ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
It came out great.	Guddaa ta'ee ba'e.
Sometimes it’s every night.	Yeroo tokko tokko halkan hunda ta’a.
That's where he went.	Sana bakka deeme.
We need to meet Him.	Isa waliin wal arguu qabna.
Then come back here.	Sana booda as deebi'i.
You better be around.	Ati naannoo kee jiraachuu siif wayya.
I hadn't thought about them before	Kana dura waa'ee isaanii hin yaadne ture
She had no way of knowing right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana karaa itti beektu hin qabdu turte.
But I can't see where it is.	Garuu bakka jiru arguu hin danda'u.
I need her more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa ishee na barbaachisa
It was in some area.	Naannoo tokko tokko keessa ture.
I need a big big one	Guddaa guddaa na barbaachisa
I just didn’t want any more	Kana caalaa qofa hin barbaanne
Nothing else worked.	Wanti biraa hin hojjenne.
Then it could be more.	Sana booda kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
It looked really good.	Dhuguma gaarii fakkaata ture.
He had it with him the whole time.	Yeroo guutuu of biraa qaba ture.
But it's happening later.	Garuu booda ta'aa jira.
He had no answer, he just walked out	Deebii hin qabu ture, ba'e qofa
Wait for that time.	Yeroo sanatti eegaa.
Shoes for a great job.	Kophee hojii guddaa hojjechuuf.
And I'll just sit here	Anis as qofa taa'a
Just a little help.	Gargaarsa xiqqoo qofa.
It doesn't happen on its own.	Ofii isaatiin hin ta'u.
He had a life, a career.	Jireenya, hojii qaba ture.
I could do so much for you.	Waan baay'ee siif gochuu nan danda'a ture.
I didn’t want to see anyone.	Nama tokkollee arguu hin barbaanne.
Lots of good ideas.	Yaada gaarii baay'ee.
Very, very happy.	Baayyee baayyee gammade.
I couldn’t help but comment on this picture	Suuraa kana irratti yaada kennuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I’ll probably never see him again.	Kana booda isa arguu hin oolu.
I thought he did some really good stuff.	Waan dhuguma gaarii taʼe tokko tokko hojjete jedheen yaade.
It's still good.	Ammallee gaarii dha.
I didn’t know anyone there.	Nama achi jiru hin beeku ture.
He didn't say anything else.	Waan biraa hin dubbanne.
I was right, that was bad	Ani sirrii ture, sun hamaa ture
I know you like that.	Akkas akka jaallattu nan beeka.
But it wasn’t mine.	Garuu kan koo hin turre.
It made her fall asleep.	Hirriba ishee godhe.
He almost couldn't see it	Arguu hin dandeenye jechuun ni danda'ama
I can stay but for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf malee turuu nan danda'a.
I am happy to be with her again	Ammas ishee wajjin taʼuu kootti gammadeera
I started towards him	Anis gara isaatti jalqabe
He didn’t have any of it.	Inni tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Everyone but you could see it.	Ati malee namni hundi arguu danda'a ture.
I think it should be.	Ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
Everything was fine after that.	Sana booda wanti hundi gaarii ture.
No one would tell me anything about it.	Namni waa'ee isaa homaa natti himu hin jiru ture.
I don't know who it is.	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku.
Sometimes even more.	Yeroo tokko tokko kana caalaa illee.
Not today, not ever.	Har'a miti, yoomiyyuu miti.
We just need the will.	Fedhii qofa nu barbaachisa.
That, and the dog.	Sana, fi saree.
He could be a lot of things, but he wasn't.	Inni waan baay'ee ta'uu danda'a, garuu akkas hin turre.
I have no idea what any of this means	Kana keessaa tokkollee maal jechuu akka ta’e yaada hin qabu
They can still vote.	Ammas sagalee kennuu danda'u.
I wasn’t that person	Ani nama sana hin turre
Completely different.	Guutummaatti adda.
It’s not something we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu miti.
I think he should know	Beekuu qaba jedheen yaada
They just didn’t do it for me.	Isaan qofa naaf hin goone.
I don’t mean to come so soon	Akkas dafee dhufuu jechuu koo miti
I'm sure he enjoyed that.	Sana akka itti gammade mirkanaa'adha.
Now that’s more of the same.	Amma sun caalaatti wal fakkaata.
Perhaps he did not do it anymore.	Tarii kana booda hin goone taʼa.
I certainly couldn’t.	Ani akkan hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
I didn’t know enough	Ani gahaa hin beeku ture
This is who she really is.	Dhuguma eenyu akka taate kana.
Maybe we are doing something right?.	Tarii waan tokko sirriitti hojjechaa jirra ta'a?.
I love him as much as I love my daughter	Ani akkuma intala kootti isa jaalladha
I like walking at night	Halkan deemuun natti tola
They were good last year.	Bara darbe gaarii turan.
Can't come soon enough!.	Dafee dhufuu hin danda'u!.
I didn’t want one at the time	Yeroo sanatti tokko hin barbaanne
I liked it very much.	Baayyee natti tola ture.
We were very lucky.	Baay'ee carraa qabna turre.
You don't know anything else.	Waan biraa hin beektu.
Perhaps it is inevitable.	Tarii hin oolu.
Had a similar issue once.	Yeroo tokko dhimma wal fakkaatu qaba ture.
Everything was the same.	Wanti hundi wal fakkaata ture.
He walked into the room.	Kutaa sana keessa deeme.
What they would have been.	Wanti isaan silaa turan.
I think that was important	Sun barbaachisaa ture jedheen yaada
I will never know.	Yoomiyyuu hin beeku.
I think this is none of your business	Kun dhimma keessan miti jedheen yaada
I wonder if he’s in trouble	Rakkoo keessa jiraa jedheen yaada
You need a car.	Konkolaataa si barbaachisa.
But he said nothing without reason.	Garuu sababa malee homaa hin dubbanne.
I hope you are not in another danger	Balaa biraa keessa akka hin jirre abdiin qaba
I was clear.	Ani ifa ture.
I don’t know where to go from here.	As irraa eessa akkan deemu hin beeku.
He looked at his father.	Abbaa isaa ilaale.
I think it was hours	Sa'aatii ture natti fakkaata
I didn't know you were a mother	Haadha ta'uu kee hin beeku ture
That is not usually the case.	Yeroo baayyee akkas miti.
I didn't want anything	Ani homaa hin barbaanne
She had to admit this.	Kana amanuu qabdi turte.
It didn’t really do anything	Dhuguma homaa hin hojjenne
People can know.	Namoonni beekuu danda'u.
I absolutely love it.	Ani guutummaatti nan jaalladha.
I was with him, but not really there	Ani isa waliin ture, garuu dhuguma achi hin turre
You have your own.	Kan kee qabda.
But it couldn't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin dandeenye.
It's usually not a big problem.	Yeroo baayyee rakkoo guddaa miti.
I was nothing to you	Ani siif homaa hin turre
That came later.	Sun booda dhufe.
But all around a good time.	Garuu naannoo hundumaa yeroo gaarii.
He’s not a great guy.	Gurbaa guddaa miti.
When everything is great, nothing is.	Yeroo wanti hundi guddaa ta'u wanti hin jiru.
So it's pretty good.	Kanaaf baay'ee gaarii dha.
He still didn’t say anything.	Ammallee homaa hin dubbanne.
She had not seen the light of day for a long time now.	Amma yeroo dheeraaf ifa guyyaa hin argine turte.
That's all that's happening.	Kan ta'aa jiru kana qofa.
I hadn’t thought of that	Ani akkas hin yaadne ture
But not soon enough.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti gahaa miti.
But he wasn’t interested	Garuu fedhii hin qabu ture
But it’s not easy.	Garuu salphaa miti.
I didn’t have time for it.	Yeroon isaaf hin qabu ture.
He had everything.	Waan hundumaa qaba ture.
One has to walk on it.	Tokko irra deemuu qaba.
At the same time,.	Kanuma waliin,.
You know, look at a lot of people.	Beektaa namoota baay'ee ilaalaa.
So now it took a lot of time.	Kanaaf amma yeroo baay'ee fudhate.
Look at you.	Si ilaalaa.
I want him, I love him so much	Isa barbaada, baay'een jaalladha
I mean, he is.	Isa jechuu kooti.
I still didn't know why	Maaliif akka ta'e hanga ammaatti hin beeku ture
I need him to do that again.	Ammas akkas akka godhu na barbaachisa.
Two years later.	Waggaa lama booda.
That was pretty cool.	Sun baayyee namatti tola ture.
They were both wrong.	Isaan lamaan dogoggora turan.
Among the many people.	Namoota baay'ee keessaa.
I can't see much of anything.	Waan baay'ee arguu hin danda'u.
There was nothing in the car to help.	Konkolaataa keessa wanti gargaaru hin turre.
He always does that right now.	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo ammaa akkas godha.
You really are something.	Dhuguma ati waan tokko.
This isn’t really the case.	Kun dhuguma akkas miti.
She said my name.	Maqaa koo jette.
But they may not know exactly.	Garuu sirriitti beekuu dhiisuu danda'u.
But I'm fine.	Ani garuu gaarii dha.
They tell me.	Isaan natti himu.
I can't live without her anymore	Kana booda ishee malee jiraachuu hin danda'u
I know you know where it is	Bakka jiru akka beektu nan beeka
I want to tell you something	Waan tokko sitti himuu barbaada
I thought you would want to know	Beekuu ni barbaaddu jedheen yaade
Until recently, my voice worked well.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti sagalee koo akka gaariitti hojjeta ture.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Kanaaf sababni lama ta’uu danda’a.
Not much, just now.	Baay'ee miti, amma qofa.
We were a lot.	Baay'ee turre.
He is a good man.	Nama gaarii dha.
Promises and possibilities.	Waadaa fi ta'uu danda'a.
We wanted to be right.	Sirrii ta'uu barbaanne.
It’s not what you have.	Waan qabdu miti.
No one has done it better than us.	Namni nu caalaa hojjete hin jiru.
Tomorrow is a new day.	Boru guyyaa haaraa dha.
That is not the case now.	Amma akkas miti.
Much like his father	Baay'ee akka abbaa isaa
I'm not like a father	Ani akka abbaa hin ta'u
No one knew about it.	Waa'ee kanaa namni beeku hin turre.
The best part of the day.	Kutaa guyyaa keessaa isa gaarii.
Doing all the work.	Hojii hunda hojjechuu.
I think more of everyone in the house	Nama mana keessa jiru hunda caalaa nan yaada
You know the answer to this.	Deebii kanaa ni beektu.
This is not an issue.	Kun dhimma miti.
I will be your teacher.	Ani barsiisaa kee ta'a.
It came with nothing.	Homaa tokko malee dhufe.
I wondered how old he was.	Umuriin isaa meeqa jedheen yaade.
What else is there?.	Kan biraa maaltu jira?.
They had to go back to it.	Itti deebi'uu qabu turan.
Not even him.	Isa illee miti.
Nobody made a big deal about it.	Namni waa'ee kanaa waan guddaa godhe hin jiru.
I hope he’s not interested in me	Inni naaf fedhii akka hin qabne abdiin qaba
I like it a lot more now.	Amma baay'ee natti tola.
Still, it happened.	Ammas ta'ee, ta'e.
I knew he had done it several times before.	Kana dura yeroo hedduu akka godhe nan beeka ture.
I came up with just him	Isa qofa jedheen dhufe
It's a good night.	Halkan gaarii dha.
I don't know what's going on here.	Asitti maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
It doesn’t have a good one.	Gaarii hin qabu.
Often.	Yeroo hedduu.
I could help around the house.	Naannoo manaa gargaaruu nan dandaʼa ture.
I was with him before	Dura isa waliin ture
Just one of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokko qofa.
He never wanted her to know	Akka isheen beektu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
He is there.	Inni achi jira.
He must know what is happening	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu qaba
This was very important.	Kun baay’ee barbaachisaa ture.
But we were wrong.	Garuu dogoggora turre.
I thought you had it.	Ati waan qabdu natti fakkaate.
Working on it.	Irratti hojjechuu.
I know everything about her	Waa'ee ishee waan hundumaa nan beeka
I knew this was true	Kun dhugaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture
He knows better.	Inni caalaatti beeka.
He knows he shouldn’t have come here.	As dhufuu akka hin qabne ni beeka.
No answer, nothing.	Deebii hin qabu, homaa hin qabu.
This was the time.	Kun yeroo ture.
I thought it was going pretty well	Baayyee gaarii deemaa jira jedheen yaade
I just don’t think so	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu qofa
Everything was happening so quickly.	Wanti hundi akkas dafee ta'aa ture.
This does a couple of things.	Kun waan tokko lama hojjeta.
I knew he was going	Akka inni deemu nan beeka ture
I wanted to know more, feel more	Caalaatti beekuu, caalaatti miira qabaachuu barbaade
I have the time.	Yeroon qaba.
I wonder what happened	Maaltu ta'e jedheen yaada
I’m not interested anymore	Kana booda fedhii hin qabu
He’s here with his wife.	Inni haadha manaa isaa waliin as jira.
We have another one.	Kan biraa qabna.
He still hasn’t said that.	Ammallee akkas hin dubbanne.
Just look at that.	Sana qofa ilaalaa.
I won’t do it anymore.	Kana booda hin godhu.
But you don't have to be that extreme.	Garuu hangas garmalee ta'uu hin qabdu.
She really didn’t need one.	Dhuguma tokko ishee hin barbaachifne.
I hope it will be.	Akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
It says nothing about us	Waa'ee keenya homaa hin jedhu
He didn’t have one for him	Tokko isaaf hin qabu ture
That’s not life.	Sun jireenya miti.
I shouldn't say that	Akkas jechuu hin qabu
He just looked at her	Ishee qofa ilaale
He didn’t have a good answer	Deebii gaarii hin qabu ture
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
He was just doing his job.	Inni hojii isaa qofa hojjechaa ture.
After sleep, however, something was different.	Hirriba booda garuu wanti adda ta'e tokko ture.
He knew exactly who he wanted.	Eenyu akka barbaadu sirriitti beeka ture.
Not bad, not good, not nothing.	Hamaa miti, gaarii miti, homaa miti.
If we didn't, none of us would be here.	Osoo akkas hin goone ta'ee nu keessaa tokkollee as hin jiru ture.
I was never good at much	Ani gonkumaa baay'ee irratti ga'umsa hin qabu ture
I think we need to talk about it	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu qabna jedheen yaada
You know one thing.	Tokko ni beekta.
It wasn’t there before	Duraan hin turre
That’s when I saw my mistake	Yeroo sanatti dogoggora koo arge
I am not interested in helping you	Ani isin gargaaruuf fedhii hin qabu
He is extremely good.	Inni garmalee gaarii dha.
I think this is going to be a great book	Kun kitaaba guddaa ta'uuf deema jedheen yaada
It was going to be great.	Guddaa ta'uuf ture.
He looked at it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ilaale.
I don't think it will.	Hin ta'u natti hin fakkaatu.
He was extremely happy	Garmalee gammade
I can't believe you didn't see me	Na hin argine jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I couldn’t leave you alone in that road	Karaa sana keessatti kophaa kee si dhiisuu hin dandeenye
But it was just as simple as that	Garuu akkuma sanaa salphaa ture
I never want to go!	Ani gonkumaa deemuu hin barbaadu!
But I don't understand why	Maaliif akka ta'e garuu naaf hin galle
It could be my friends.	Hiriyyoota koo ta'uu danda'a.
I can be someone else	Ani nama biraa ta'uu nan danda'a
That should be enough.	Sun gahaa ta'uu qaba.
He didn't say anything else	Waan biraa hin dubbanne
Lots of questions.	Gaaffii baay'ee.
She was once my father’s dog.	Yeroo tokko saree abbaa koo turte.
A little while ago.	Xiqqoo dura.
Now, it’s my mom’s turn.	Amma, yeroon haadha kooti.
But this was no longer true.	Garuu kun kana booda dhugaa hin turre.
I thought maybe she had	Tarii qabdi jedheen yaade
I didn’t think so, but we had to do something	Ani akkas natti hin fakkaatu ture, garuu waan tokko gochuu qabna turre
I was just looking at myself	Ofii koo qofa ilaalaa ture
I did this here and there	Halkan halkan kana nan godhe
It works fine for me.	Naaf gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
I had too many questions and not enough answers	Gaaffii baay'ee fi deebii gahaa hin qabu ture
He hadn't thought of that.	Inni akkas jedhee hin yaadne ture.
It was the state of his existence.	Haala jiraachuu isaa ture.
He saw you.	Inni si arge.
I told him it was a good name	Maqaa gaarii akka ta'e itti hime
This was their night.	Halkan isaanii kun ture.
I want to know the same thing	Anis kanuma beekuu barbaada
He certainly isn’t.	Inni akkas akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I do that from time to time	Yeroo yeroon akkas nan godha
Not going back here.	Asitti deebi'uu miti.
It was a good thing.	Waan gaarii ture.
None of this happened.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin taane.
You know, it was like that at the time.	Beektaa yeroo sanatti akkas ture.
I couldn’t see anything anymore.	Kana booda homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t want him to do it	Ani akka inni godhu hin barbaanne
I would say she was with him.	Isa waliin turte nan jedha.
I wanted no part of it.	Kutaa isaa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
This is not the case.	Kun miti.
I didn’t need anyone else	Nama biraa na hin barbaachifne
I love your place so much	Bakka kee baay'een jaalladha
He didn't think of anything	Homaa hin yaadne
Three weeks that were more like three months.	Torban sadii kan caalaatti ji'a sadii fakkaata ture.
I want to know more about this situation	Waa'ee haala kanaa caalaatti beekuu barbaada
You need to know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qabda.
I saw them in her room.	Kutaa ishee keessatti isaan arge.
It looked a little like you	Xiqqoo si fakkaata ture
It's not right.	Sirrii miti.
I mean, they’re still out there	Ammallee ala jiru jechuu kooti
I didn’t mean anything	Homaa jechuu koo hin turre
It's just not going to happen.	Ta'uuf hin deemu qofa.
I really wanted to help her	Ishee gargaaruu baay'een barbaade
This could be me.	Kun ana ta'uu danda'a.
Not with this one.	Isa kanaan miti.
I love my children.	Ijoollee koo nan jaalladha.
I'm not even sure if it's a feeling	Miira ta'uu isaa illee mirkanaa'aa miti
So many of us are alone.	Kanaaf baay'een keenya kophaa keenya.
I didn’t do any of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
Hope all goes well.	Hundi akka gaariitti akka deemu abdii qabna.
We all worked too hard.	Hundi keenya garmalee hojjenne.
This one only took two years.	Inni kun waggaa lama qofa fudhate.
It would be wrong in almost every case.	Haala hunda keessatti jechuun ni danda’ama dogoggora ta’a.
You can go home with this.	Kanaan gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
This is certainly not the case.	Kun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I'm not good at it.	Ani irratti ga'umsa hin qabu.
It will be real with you	Si waliin dhugaa ta'a
It was true.	Dhugaa ture.
Then it became a book.	Sana booda kitaaba ta'e.
You know this about me.	Waa'ee koo kana ni beekta.
I don't even have the truth.	Ani dhugaa illee hin qabu.
I couldn't leave you	Si dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I think that’s true.	Sun dhugaa natti fakkaata.
Nothing, maybe.	Homaa miti, tarii.
He didn’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabu ture.
This means that the.	Kana jechuun kan.
I'm looking for him.	Ani isa barbaada.
I am right now.	Ani amma jira.
He wouldn’t have done that to her	Silaa akkas ishee hin godhu ture
I never would have known him, but he did it for me	Silaa gonkumaa isa hin beeku ture, garuu inni naaf godhe
That never works.	Sun gonkumaa hin hojjetu.
She’s just a little bit.	Isheen xiqqoo qofa.
I think it's right.	Sirrii natti fakkaata.
I wondered what was going on	Maaltu ta'aa jira jedheen yaade
I like to do something	Waan tokko hojjechuu nan jaalladha
I don’t need anyone to make me whole.	Nama guutuu na godhu na hin barbaachisu.
Like you, I want to go home	Anis akkuma kee gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaada
I should never have asked her	Silaa gonkumaa ishee gaafachuu hin qabu ture
I’m definitely qualified	Ani ga’umsa akkan qabu beekamaadha
But, it does happen.	Garuu, ni ta'a.
But it’s not just asking.	Garuu gaafachuu qofa miti.
I don’t think these people would have done that.	Silaa namoonni kun akkas gochaa turan natti hin fakkaatu.
I should have told him a lot earlier	Silaa kana dura waan baay'ee itti himuu qaba ture
I could help you, you know	Si gargaaruu nan danda'a ture, beekta
I wanted to do the right thing	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjechuu nan barbaade
He didn't tell us anything different.	Waan adda ta'e nutti hin himne.
I love to eat food.	Nyaata nyaachuu nan jaalladha.
I can't see anything	Homaa arguu hin danda'u
I couldn’t give him children	Ijoollee isaaf kennuu hin dandeenye
I would have known.	Silaa nan beeka ture.
On the way.	Karaa irratti.
I know better than that.	Kana caalaa nan beeka.
You know that you know.	Akka beektu ni beekta.
He wouldn't say that.	Akkasitti hin jedhu ture.
I knew it wasn’t	Akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I want to talk to him	Isa dubbachuu barbaada
I didn’t notice any mistakes.	Dogoggora tokkollee hin hubanne.
When he went to	Yeroo inni gara .
It's not about that.	Waa'ee sanaa miti.
The language is clear.	Afaan ifaadha.
I had no luck on this much	Baay'ee kana irratti carraa hin qabu ture
What are you waiting for.	Maal eegaa jirtu.
Two weeks, maybe.	Torban lama, tarii.
I can't do it without you	Si malee gochuu hin danda'u
But that was not the case.	Wanti sun garuu hin turre.
Tonight would be her night.	Halkan kana halkan ishee ta'a ture.
I really like this one.	Isa kana baay'een jaalladha.
I doubt it very much.	Baay'een shakka.
I want to tell him this.	Kana itti himuu barbaada.
Elsewhere.	Bakka biraa.
But so far that is not the case.	Garuu hanga ammaatti akkas miti.
One doesn’t need much food	Namni nyaata baay’ee hin barbaadu
He knows his car.	Konkolaataa isaa ni beeka.
We were on our way to becoming human.	Karaa nama ta'uu irra turre.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
It may not last long	Yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u ta'a
It wasn’t like her.	Akka ishee hin turre.
But that wasn’t a problem.	Garuu sun rakkoo hin turre.
We stayed with our class.	Kutaa keenya waliin turre.
Hours, it will be.	Sa'aatii, ni ta'a.
Maybe it's not like that.	Tarii akkas ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
It is a well-known place.	Bakka beekamaadha.
I didn’t know what, but something wasn’t right here	Maal hin beeku ture, garuu asitti wanti tokko sirrii hin turre
On that day.	Guyyaa sanatti.
It could have been any of them.	Silaa isaan keessaa tokkollee ta’uu danda’a ture.
In this case, it’s not a chance.	Haala kana keessatti carraa miti.
I don’t have time during the week	Torban keessa yeroo hin qabu
I didn't want that to happen	Akkas akka ta'u hin barbaanne
It's definitely going to happen.	Ta'uuf jira jechuun hin oolu.
Just one new person.	Nama haaraa tokko qofa.
I did, and the problem still exists	Anis nan godhe, rakkoon sun amma iyyuu jira
You probably wouldn’t.	Ati tarii hin gootu turte.
I want to be yours	Ani kan kee ta'uu nan barbaada
They were becoming one.	Tokko ta'aa turan.
The old sound.	Sagalee durii.
Someone has to do something with him now.	Namni tokko amma waan tokko isa waliin gochuu qaba.
He’s excited.	Inni gammadeera.
That’s when he realized something else.	Yeroo sanatti waan biraa hubate.
I thought about you all day	Guyyaa guutuu waa'ee kee yaade
That's what happened with me.	Ana waliin ta'e kanuma.
I was right.	Ani sirrii ture.
I wondered what he said	Maal jedhe jedheen yaade
See that it happens.	Akka ta'u ilaalaa.
I wonder if anyone knows if that is the case.	Akkas ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa namni beeku jiraa jedheen yaada.
Maybe it never was.	Tarii gonkumaa hin turre.
I think it’s important	Barbaachisaa natti fakkaata
I don't mean that.	Ani akkas jechuu koo miti.
They have to be the same thing.	Waan tokko ta'uu qabu.
I used to not do that.	Duraan akkas hin godhu ture.
We are in a new place right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana bakka haaraa jirra.
I mean, that’s every day	Sun guyyaa hunda jechuu kooti
She was sure of it.	Isheen mirkanaa'aa turte.
I wanted to get to know him better	Caalaatti isa beekuu barbaade
Lots of fresh food to make	Nyaata haaraa baay'ee hojjechuuf
There is no problem.	Rakkoon hin jiru.
The right house of the house	Mana sirrii ta'e manaa
I’m not here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana as hin jiru.
I didn't know much.	Hedduu hin beeku ture.
He had almost the whole day there.	Guyyaa guutuu jechuun ni danda'ama achitti qaba ture.
He wanted me there.	Achitti na barbaade.
But even that didn’t seem enough.	Garuu sun illee waan gahaa hin fakkaatu ture.
They say this.	Kana jedhu.
I mean, they always do	Yeroo hundumaa ni godhu jechuu kooti
He thought he had found the light.	Ifa argate itti fakkaate.
I like this very much.	Kun baayyee natti tola.
No one else was in the room.	Namni biraa kutaa sana keessa hin turre.
We need to work together	Waliin hojjechuu qabna
Just like in the old days.	Akkuma bara durii.
There were only so many hours in the day.	Guyyaa keessa sa'aatii hamma kana qofa ture.
He has a chance.	Carraa qaba.
But this is not what happens.	Garuu wanti ta'u kana miti.
That is their job.	Hojiin isaanii kanuma.
So you.	Kanaaf ati.
I think that’s all we can do here tonight	Halkan kana asitti gochuu dandeenyu kana qofa jedheen yaada
I was about to leave	Anis deemuuf jedheen ture
I have a few questions.	Gaaffii muraasa qaba.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
I have said that.	Ani akkas jedheera.
I thought sure she had	Akka qabdu mirkanaa'aa jedheen yaade
I was still me, but not really	Ani ammallee ana ture, garuu dhuguma miti
I can't leave you here	Asitti si dhiisuu hin danda'u
I can't, I can't, I can't	Hin danda'u, hin danda'u, hin danda'u
I have no idea why you are here	Maaliif akka as jirtu yaada hin qabu
I need some help with this.	Kanaaf gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
But that could happen.	Garuu sun ta'uu danda'a.
Only one eye this time.	Yeroo kana ija tokko qofa.
That was lucky.	Sun carraa ture.
I have no idea about it	Waa'ee kanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu
I couldn’t live like that	Akkas jiraachuu hin dandeenye
They had no excuse.	Sababa hin qaban turan.
Not unimaginative, exactly, but .	Kan hin yaadne miti, sirriitti, garuu .
I couldn't believe this was happening	Kun ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
They absolutely can.	Isaan guutummaatti ni danda'u.
We weren’t quite friends anymore.	Kana booda guutummaatti hiriyyoota hin turre.
I couldn't tell.	Himuu hin dandeenye.
He knows us.	Inni nu beeka.
I told myself it was all my imagination	Hundi yaada kooti jedheen ofitti hime
So it can't be that bad.	Kanaaf hangas hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I couldn't see the way	Karaa arguu hin dandeenye
They’ve always been like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas turan.
They are always with us.	Yeroo hundumaa nu waliin jiru.
I still love it.	Ammallee nan jaalladha.
Once, twice.	Yeroo tokko, lama.
I know you don’t mean me	Ana jechuu akka hin taane nan beeka
But of course, he’s not here.	Garuu beekamaadha, inni as hin jiru.
Maybe that's where he got the idea.	Tarii bakka inni yaada sana argate sana ta'uu danda'a.
I wondered if he was still in his room	Ammas kutaa isaa keessa jiraa jedheen yaade
You have to live in the moment.	Yeroo sana keessa jiraachuu qabda.
I hadn’t seen this one before	Isa kana kanaan dura hin argine ture
It was mostly boys.	Irra caalaa gurbaa ture.
He was a good guy.	Inni nama gaarii ture.
What was happening now was not her father.	Wanti amma ta'aa jiru kun abbaa ishee hin turre.
I can tell something about you	Waa'ee kee waan tokko himuu nan danda'a
People like that, you don’t want around.	Namoonni akkasii, naannoo kee hin barbaaddu.
It came quickly.	Dafee dhufe.
I really hoped it wasn’t true	Dhuguma dhugaa akka hin taane abdiin qaba ture
We can’t help ourselves.	Of gargaaruu hin dandeenyu.
I’m just saying I have one	Tokko qaba jechuu koo qofa
That could have been the case.	Silaa akkas ta'uu danda'a ture.
I still didn’t know what to do	Ammallee waanan godhu hin beeku ture
I didn’t really think about it at all	Dhuguma tasumaa itti hin yaadne
But walk through something with me.	Garuu waan tokko keessa na waliin deemaa.
It couldn't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
He said nothing about his problems.	Rakkoo isaa homaa hin dubbanne.
But not all of them were.	Hundi isaanii garuu hin turre.
You can’t do it alone.	Kophaa kee hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
No one really knew him.	Namni dhuguma isa beeku hin turre.
He was the hope.	Inni abdii ture.
I won’t say any more now	Amma kana caalaa hin jedhu
Just like this.	Akkuma kana.
I like your ideas too much	Yaada keessan garmalee natti tola
I still need it as much as everyone else.	Ammallee akkuma nama hundumaa na barbaachisa.
I never do, not really.	Ani gonkumaa hin godhu, dhuguma miti.
I think it’s a joke.	Qoosaa natti fakkaata.
I could just live in here	As keessa jiraachuu qofa nan danda'a ture
But you can see my eyes.	Garuu ija koo arguu dandeessa.
I haven’t done that for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas hin goone
No one was going to do it for you.	Namni siif gochuuf deemu hin turre.
Maybe not that night, but soon after.	Tarii halkan sana miti, garuu yeroo muraasa booda.
I don't think much of him.	Ani baay'ee isa hin yaadu.
I can never go back there	Yoomiyyuu achitti deebi'uu hin danda'u
What could be the problem.	Rakkoo maal ta'uu danda'a.
It didn’t happen.	Hin taane.
He should tell his parents.	Warra isaatti himuu qaba.
Almost no one else.	Namni biraa hin jiru jechuun ni danda'ama.
Everything you needed to know was already there.	Wanti beekuu qabdu hundi duruu achi ture.
It was who he was now.	Amma eenyu akka ta'e ture.
No one wanted to be easy.	Namni salphaa ta'uu barbaade hin jiru.
I know why he had to go	Maaliif akka deemuu qabu nan beeka
I think they are something else.	Isaan waan biraa natti fakkaata.
We won’t do that anymore.	Kana booda akkas hin goonu.
That is entirely possible.	Sun guutummaatti taʼuu dandaʼa.
Then we have to go.	Sana booda deemuu qabna.
That's not really what was going to happen.	Dhuguma wanti ta'uuf ture sun miti.
I think they were making fun of me	Natti qoosaa turan natti fakkaata
Someone who understood	Nama hubate
We need something different.	Waan adda ta'e nu barbaachisa.
He never wanted her to know the truth	Dhugaa jiru akka beektu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
He knew that voice so well	Sagalee sana akkasitti beeka ture
He knew he would never see it again.	Kana booda akka hin argine beeka ture.
I think it's yours	Kan keessan natti fakkaata
I mean like a good thing.	Akka waan gaariitti jechuu kooti.
Every night is different.	Halkan hunda adda adda.
Check it out!!!.	Mee ilaalaa!!!.
There is no reason for this.	Kanaaf sababni hin jiru.
I don't want to do that.	Akkas gochuu hin barbaadu.
I was my own.	Ani kan koo ture.
I love that person	Ani nama sana nan jaalladha
Maybe he can.	Tarii ni danda'a ta'a.
It looks like that.	Akkas fakkaata.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	Yeroo sanatti yaada gaarii fakkaata ture.
If it does, it will happen.	Yoo ta'e ni ta'a.
That’s how he should find them.	Akkasitti isaan argachuu qaba.
I can't do it like that.	Akkasitti gochuu hin danda'u.
Maybe you can stay for a while.	Tarii yeroo muraasaaf turuu dandeessa.
This is probably not what you want.	Kun tarii waan ati barbaaddu miti.
I can't tell you about it	Waa'ee isaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
We have a house.	Mana qabna.
But one morning.	Garuu ganama tokko.
It was very different then.	Yeroo sanatti baayyee adda ture.
So you must leave us now.	Kanaaf amma nu dhiisuu qabdu.
Everything is going for me.	Wanti hundi naaf deemaa jira.
He knew them very well	Baay'ee isaan beeka ture
This is not a new book.	Kun kitaaba haaraa miti.
Nothing really special.	Dhuguma waan adda ta'e hin jiru.
I should probably go back	Ani tarii deebi'uu qaba
We had it pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii qabna turre.
She holds it to herself.	Ofitti qabdi.
Things like that.	Wantoota akkasii.
But what else he could not say.	Garuu kan biraa maaltu ture jechuu hin dandeenye.
He hesitated again.	Ammas duubatti jedhe.
He was there when it happened	Yeroo ta'u achi ture
I know no one likes me in school	Mana barumsaa keessatti namni na jaallatu akka hin jirre nan beeka
He really needs to do something about that.	Dhuguma waa'ee sanaa waan tokko gochuu qaba.
I am just one person	Ani nama tokko qofa
I wanted children and a simple life	Ijoollee fi jireenya salphaa nan barbaada ture
No way.	Gonkumaa hin ta'u.
So very, very wrong.	Kanaaf baayyee baayyee dogoggora.
What is inside him.	Waan keessa isaa keessa jiru.
I know he did.	Akka godhe nan beeka.
I didn’t want to do this	Ani kana gochuu hin barbaanne
I didn't think about it anymore.	Kana booda waa'ee kanaa hin yaadne.
It is very possible.	Baayyee ni danda'ama.
I will do it soon.	Dafee nan godha.
I can't do that to you	Ani akkas si gochuu hin danda'u
He’s the only one.	Inni qofa.
I know this can't be right	Kun sirrii ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
I wasn't in the mood to be lucky	Ani akka carraa ta'uuf miira keessa hin turre
I mean, there isn’t one.	Tokkollee hin jiru jechuu kooti.
Everything had taken much longer than it needed to.	Wanti hundi yeroo barbaachisaa taʼe caalaa baayʼee fudhate ture.
I think it took a while	Yeroo fudhate natti fakkaata
I couldn't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I love my life.	Jireenya koo nan jaalladha.
I didn't know why at the time	Yeroo sanatti maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture
One of them said.	Isaan keessaa tokko jedhe.
I was happy with myself	Ofitti gammadeera
Like everyone else.	Akkuma nama hundumaa.
I wasn’t above that kind of thinking	Ani yaada akkasii ol hin turre
I saw it again.	Ammas arge.
I have a long day tomorrow	Boru guyyaa dheeraa qaba
I knew it was important	Barbaachisaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture
It works a lot.	Baay'ee hojjeta.
But it looks really good.	Garuu dhuguma gaarii fakkaata.
Even more than myself.	Ofii koo caalaa illee.
That didn't work out very well.	Sun baayyee gaarii hin hojjenne.
Look into his eyes.	Ija isaa keessa ilaalaa.
I need your feedback	Yaada keessan na barbaachisa
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
I just thought I would.	Anis jedheen yaada qofa.
Now, it's still not easy, but it's possible.	Amma, ammallee salphaa miti, garuu ni danda'ama.
It just happened last week.	Torban darbe qofa ta'e.
One of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko.
I think you could have done better	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa jedheen yaada
We are still there.	Ammas achi jirra.
She doesn't like it.	Isheen hin jaallattu.
I really don’t know anything	Dhuguma waanan beeku hin qabu
He wasn't that interested about it all.	Inni waa'ee kana hundumaa hangas fedhii hin qabu ture.
I couldn't say that.	Akkas jechuu hin dandeenye.
I saw your mother.	Haadha kee arge.
But now it is different.	Amma garuu adda.
I can do what she can't	Waan isheen hin dandeenye hojjechuu nan danda'a
There must be.	Jiraachuu qaba.
But he didn't.	Garuu hin goone.
Except she wasn’t.	Isheen hin turre malee.
He being different from her mother.	Inni haadha ishee irraa adda ta’uu isaatiin.
I know this is not a problem.	Kun rakkoo akka hin taane nan beeka.
I really don’t want to give them up just yet.	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kana qofa isaan dhiisuu hin barbaadu.
He could have known.	Silaa beekuu danda'a ture.
I'm not going to the clinic with him tonight	Halkan kana gara mana yaalaa isa waliin hin deemu
I never said that.	Ani akkas jedhee hin beeku.
Nothing out of the ordinary, just luck, nothing she could see.	Waan adda ta'e hin jiru, carraa qofa, waan isheen arguu dandeessu hin jiru.
He knew exactly what was happening in him	Waan isaa keessatti ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeka ture
I know your name	Maqaa kee nan beeka
I didn't understand either	Anis naaf hin galle
I mean, you're like that.	Ati akkas jechuu kooti.
I didn’t know what he meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaade hin beeku ture
This is, of course, perfectly valid.	Kun, beekamaadha, guutummaatti sirrii dha.
There is nothing anyone can do about it.	Wanti namni tokkollee gochuu danda'u hin jiru.
She said sorry.	Dhiifama jette.
That’s one way.	Sun karaa tokko.
I wanted to be him	Isa ta'uu barbaade
I want to be very clear about this.	Waa'ee kanaa baay'ee ifa ta'uu barbaada.
But that was it.	Garuu kanuma ture.
He knows exactly what he’s doing.	Waan inni hojjetu sirriitti beeka.
I know you have a job	Hojii akka qabdu nan beeka
He took everything he had.	Waan qabu hunda fudhate.
I know that moment	Yeroo sana nan beeka
I would have no way of knowing, of course	Silaa karaa itti beeku hin qabu ture, beekamaadha
That is not an easy task.	Sun hojii salphaa miti.
It’s everywhere right now	Yeroo ammaa kana bakka hunda jira
Now I have real and genuine friends	Amma hiriyyoota dhugaa fi dhugaa qaba
The main road.	Karaa guddaa.
I never want to see them again	Kana booda gonkumaa isaan arguu hin barbaadu
It worked out well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete.
This, however, was not always so.	Kun garuu yeroo hunda akkas hin turre.
I wasn't sure what would happen afterwards	Booda maaltu akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre
You're out there.	Ati ala jirta.
I didn’t know what to make of him	Maal akkan isa godhu hin beeku ture
Not yet you are not.	Ammallee miti ati hin jirtu.
He looks just like me except nothing	Waan tokko malee akkuma koo fakkaata
I have no idea what that’s supposed to mean.	Sun maal jechuu akka qabu yaada hin qabu.
I didn’t want to see anything	Homaa arguu hin barbaanne
I must say it was a good time.	Yeroo gaarii ture jechuu qaba.
Then he thought	Sana booda yaade
But he said nothing about you.	Garuu waa'ee kee homaa hin dubbanne.
I was a perfect man	Ani nama guutuu ture
I wonder when it will happen.	Yoom ta'a jedheen yaada.
I shouldn’t be here	Ani as jiraachuu hin qabu
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
Many people have.	Namoonni baay'een qaban.
Maybe it's a dog.	Tarii saree ta'uu danda'a.
You have a chance.	Carraa qabda.
I can't say much more right now	Yeroo ammaa kana kana caalaa waan baay'ee dubbachuu hin danda'u
Maybe, maybe, maybe .	Tarii, tarii, tarii .
This later became a book.	Kun booda kitaaba ta’e.
I want to, but not here	Ani barbaada, garuu asitti miti
I told myself I could do this	Kana gochuu nan danda'a jedhee ofitti hime
We're looking at it.	Itti ilaalaa jirra.
It looks pretty good.	Baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
I love you there so much	Achitti baay'een si jaalladha
I don't have to do this	Ani kana gochuu hin qabu
I couldn’t believe she did that	Akkas akka goote amanuu hin dandeenye
I know there’s something she’s not telling us	Waan isheen nutti hin himne akka jiru nan beeka
He wants another house available to us, just for us	Mana biraa nu harka jiru barbaada, nuuf qofa
I didn't know why then	Yeroo sana maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture
I couldn't find much about him	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee argachuu hin dandeenye
He just seems to.	Inni qofa fakkaata.
That's how it works.	Akkasitti hojjeta.
I just need some alone time	Yeroo muraasa kophaa koo qofa na barbaachisa
I know all about you	Waa'ee kee hunda nan beeka
He never does that.	Inni gonkumaa akkas hin godhu.
It’s really nothing like her.	Dhuguma akka ishee homaa miti.
This one is mine.	Inni kun kan kooti.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
I mean really good money	Maallaqa dhuguma gaarii jechuu kooti
This didn't work.	Kun hin hojjenne.
He knows nothing about his current friends	Waa'ee hiriyyoota isaa yeroo ammaa homaa hin beeku
She's a must.	Isheen dirqama.
I wanted to eat alone today	Har'a kophaa koo nyaachuu barbaade
You are absolutely correct.	Ati guutummaatti sirrii dha.
They were people.	Isaan namoota turan.
I can buy you some time	Yeroo muraasa siif bitachuu nan danda'a
It had to be somewhere else and another.	Bakka biraa fi kan biraa ta'uu qaba ture.
As you should know.	Akkuma beekuu qabdu.
I know this.	Kana nan beeka.
Not to say!.	Jechuu miti!.
That's probably still the case.	Ammas akkas ta'uu hin oolu.
More time than we need, really.	Yeroo nu barbaachisu caalaa, dhuguma.
He had the money.	Maallaqa qaba ture.
It was never necessary.	Gonkumaa barbaachisaa hin turre.
I'm here to stay.	Ani as jira.
I just want more from you	Caalaatti isin irraa barbaada qofa
But no one knew much.	Garuu namni waan baay'ee beeku hin turre.
I didn’t think anyone else noticed	Namni biraa waan hubate natti hin fakkaatu ture
I never know anything about it	Waa'ee isaa gonkumaa homaa hin beeku
But then why should it be.	Garuu sana booda maaliif ta'uu qaba.
I was never a dog person but now I have several.	Ani nama saree ta'ee hin beeku amma garuu hedduu qaba.
I thought that was great	Sun waan guddaa natti fakkaate
Nothing exactly different.	Wanti sirriitti adda ta'e hin jiru.
I had to help her	Ani ishee gargaaruu qaba ture
That he didn't want to.	Akka inni hin barbaanne.
Here, none of that.	Asitti, sana keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
People are good.	Namoonni gaarii dha.
He’s the only one.	Inni qofa.
That would have been the case for you	Silaa akkas siif ta'a ture
We have a little idea that might help.	Yaada xiqqoo gargaaruu danda'u qabna.
I love this girl so much.	Intala kana baay'een jaalladha.
I don't know the girl.	Intala hin beeku.
A very good person.	Nama baayyee gaarii.
You know something.	Waan tokko beekta.
All those good times when we were kids.	Yeroo gaarii sana hunda yeroo ijoollee turre.
We are doing this.	Kana gochaa jirra.
There was such a positive aspect to going about this job	Hojii kanaan deemuun waan gaarii akkasii qaba ture
I have to do something	Waan tokko gochuun qaba
during.	yeroo.
It's just a book.	Kitaaba qofa.
That's how you do it.	Akkasitti gootu.
There must be some about.	Waa'ee tokko tokko jiraachuu qaba.
For the most part, everyone is nice.	Irra caalaa namni hundi namatti tola.
I didn't tell him why	Maaliif akka ta'e itti hin himne
In that light.	Ifa sana keessatti.
I certainly never do	Ani gonkumaa akkan hin goone beekamaadha
I'm doing that a lot tonight.	Halkan kana baay'ee sana hojjechaa jira.
But I don’t know how to go about it.	Garuu akkamitti akkan itti deemu hin beeku.
Of course, this should have happened before it was obvious.	Kun osoo ifa hin taane ta’uu akka qabu beekamaadha.
You really don’t need anything that big.	Dhuguma waan guddaa akkasii si hin barbaachisu.
But no one had anything bad to say.	Garuu namni waan hamaa jedhu hin qabu ture.
I never want to be alone	Ani gonkumaa kophaa ta'uu hin barbaadu
You can do it.	Hojjechuu dandeessa.
He may be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
It seems to be working well so far.	Hanga ammaatti akka gaariitti waan hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
I would have known him all along	Silaa yeroo hundumaa isa beeka ture
I can help you with this	Kanaan isin gargaaruu nan danda'a
I know it will be lonely, stay tuned	Kophaa isaa akka ta'u nan beeka, na eegaa
I had no idea what she could do	Maal gochuu akka dandeessu yaada hin qabu ture
That is, before.	Kana jechuun duraan.
A lot of people know about this girl.	Waa'ee intala kanaa namoonni baay'een beeku.
When it would come was another question.	Yoom akka dhufu gaaffii biraa ture.
I wanted to be her.	Ani ishee ta'uu barbaade.
Look at it.	Itti ilaalaa.
I have no idea what he was in for	Waan keessa ture yaada hin qabu
They all had one thing in common.	Hundi isaanii waan wal fakkaatu tokko qabu turan.
Said.	Jedhe.
I really don't know.	Dhuguma hin beeku.
They are well on that.	Sana akka gaariitti irra jiru.
But I have enough of both already	Ani garuu lamaan isaaniiyyuu duruu gahaa qaba
I know now what that was	Sun maal akka ture amma beeka
I want to have friends	Hiriyyoota qabaachuu nan barbaada
I thought he loved me	Na jaallatu natti fakkaate
I could have her tonight	Halkan kana ishee qabaachuu nan danda'a ture
Love yourself a little bit.	Xiqqoo of jaalladhu.
With the dog.	Saree waliin.
He won't tell you.	Inni sitti hin himu.
I didn’t want it anymore	Kana booda hin barbaadu ture
That it can fill you up.	Akka siif guutuu danda'a.
This has been important for a long time.	Kun yeroo dheeraaf barbaachisaa ture.
That just wasn’t true.	Sun dhugaa hin turre qofa.
I still want that job	Ammallee hojii sana barbaada
They were always around.	Yeroo hundumaa naannoo sana turan.
You're the only one.	Ati qofa.
It should be a couple of hours.	Sa'aatii lama lama ta'uu qaba.
I was sure that was the case	Akkas akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa ture
What does he know.	Maal beeka.
Everything else works fine so far.	Wanti biraa hundi hanga ammaatti akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I think that’s all we can do	Kana qofa gochuu dandeenyu natti fakkaata
Neither of you are here.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu as hin jirtu.
I think about existence	Waa'ee jiraachuu nan yaada
All they have to do is.	Wanti isaan gochuu qaban qofa.
A little bit here, a little bit there	Xiqqoo asitti, xiqqoo xiqqoo achi
I know you have one.	Tokko akka qabdu nan beeka.
Was.	Ture.
But I wanted to do more.	Garuu kana caalaa hojjechuu barbaade.
He’s absolutely fine and wants to play.	Inni guutummaatti gaarii dha taphachuu barbaada.
I think he's pretty cool.	Inni baayyee namatti tola jedheen yaada.
I have a lot of their clothes	Uffata isaanii baay'een qaba
I didn’t see her again	Ammas ishee hin argine
Someone who could never leave her.	Nama gonkumaa ishee dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
But now things are different.	Amma garuu wanti jiru adda.
It matters to me right now	Yeroo ammaa kana naaf dhimma
He must know what is at stake	Waan balaa irra jiru beekuu qaba
She was my wife.	Isheen haadha manaa koo turte.
No one did it.	Namni godhe hin jiru.
The question of time	Gaaffii yeroo
The biggest problem.	Rakkoo guddaa.
But now, there’s just nothing there.	Amma garuu, achitti wanti tokkollee hin jiru qofa.
So this is extremely important.	Kanaaf kun garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
I have said my little one.	Ani xiqqoo koo jedheen jira.
I’m happy for these kids.	Ijoollee kanaaf gammadeera.
He knows about me.	Waa'ee koo ni beeka.
They have the same idea.	Yaada tokko qabu.
You didn’t think about whether or not you did something.	Waan tokko gochuu fi dhiisuu kee hin yaadne.
I don’t mean to respond that way	Akkasitti deebii kennuu jechuu koo miti
It was different when we were kids.	Yeroo ijoollee turre adda ture.
Like them, he didn’t look so good.	Akkuma isaanii akkas gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
That's what happens.	Sun ta'a.
She didn't speak.	Isheen hin dubbanne.
I wasn’t a great husband	Ani abbaa manaa guddaa hin turre
Now tell me the truth.	Amma dhugaa natti himi.
I wish there wasn't	Osoo hin jiru ta'ee natti tola
I just thought of myself up there	Anis achi ol jedheen of yaade qofa
I enjoyed it very much	Baay'een itti gammadeera
She didn’t know where else she could go.	Bakka biraa deemuu dandeessu hin beektu turte.
But that’s not exactly the case.	Garuu sirriitti akkas miti.
It certainly gave him the opportunity he had been waiting for.	Carraa eegaa ture akka isaaf kenne beekamaadha.
I didn't know many of them	Baay'ee isaanii hin beeku ture
She must be up there alone.	Kophaa ishee achi ol ta'uu qabdi.
I didn't know what was happening before.	Kanaan dura waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku.
I'm looking for someone.	Nama barbaadaa jira.
If they don’t, you won’t.	Yoo isaan hin goone ati hin gootu.
But now we have to buy it.	Amma garuu bitachuu qabna.
You can’t know what it’s like.	Maal akka fakkaatu beekuu hin dandeessu.
I always thought he was a boy	Yeroo hundumaa gurbaa natti fakkaata ture
You could be a girl.	Intala ta'uu dandeessa.
Her father, her father.	Abbaa ishee, abbaa ishee.
It was the right part.	Kutaa sirrii ture.
No one wants that!.	Namni akkas hin barbaadu!.
Maybe it wasn't.	Tarii hin turre ta'a.
But this is.	Garuu kun.
Where were you again?	Ammas eessa turte.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
You are our father.	Ati abbaa keenya.
I want them not to do that.	Akkas akka hin goone nan barbaada.
He may not have the time	Yeroo qabaachuu dhiisuu danda'a
He certainly got his.	Kan isaa akka argate beekamaadha.
I mean, our house.	Mana keenya jechuu kooti.
That wasn’t good enough for us.	Sun nuuf gaarii hin turre.
He had his chance.	Carraa isaa qaba ture.
This work is dangerous.	Hojiin kun balaa qaba.
You don't like it.	Hin jaallattu.
It was very accurate.	Baayyee sirrii ture.
It seems to have little going on.	Waan waan xiqqoo itti deemu fakkaata.
I don't know how this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu hin beeku.
It doesn’t look like work.	Hojii hin fakkaatu.
But she didn't know that.	Isheen garuu kana hin beektu turte.
He has a place that is home.	Bakka mana ta'e qaba.
This was now.	Kun amma ture.
She’s not the only one.	Ishee qofa miti.
I didn’t think it was important	Barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
Now there is nothing we can do.	Amma wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
I knew you were with me for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akka na waliin jirtu nan beeka ture
I love that they are yours	Kan kee ta'uu isaanii nan jaalladha
She hadn’t seen it.	Isheen hin argine turte.
He had no idea why or how.	Maaliif akkamitti yaada tokkollee kan qabu hin turre.
I like it that simple	Akkas salphaa ta'ee natti tola
I was going and looking for it	Anis deemaa barbaadaa ture
It gets easier, really.	Salphaa ta'a, dhuguma.
Sometimes that’s not the case.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas miti.
I know this works.	Kun akka hojjetu nan beeka.
Only so often.	Yeroo baayyee qofa.
I have plenty of time.	Yeroo baay'een qaba.
It won't be a month.	Ji'a tokko hin ta'u.
You don’t want them in this.	Kana keessatti isaan hin barbaaddu.
I think she didn’t want to go	Isheen deemuu hin barbaanne natti fakkaata
I didn’t want to stop telling you	Sitti himuu dhiisuu hin barbaanne
I knew she would do it again	Ammas akka gootu nan beeka ture
If something happens.	Yoo wanti ta'e.
It doesn’t look like him at all	Homaa isa hin fakkaatu
It has something in common with yourself	Waan ofii kee wajjin wal fakkaatu qaba
I mean, I wanted to know why	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaade jechuu kooti
I have to do that.	Sana gochuun qaba.
It just worked very well.	Baayyee gaarii qofa hojjete.
Many of us did that.	Baay'een keenya akkas goone.
Tell me about yourself.	Waan kee natti himi.
From my past.	Waan darbe koo irraa.
Not right now.	Yeroo ammaa miti.
That looks really good.	Sun dhuguma gaarii fakkaata.
Glad to see him.	Isa arguu kootti gammadeera.
While she was working.	Osoo isheen hojjechaa turte.
I had no school yesterday	Kaleessa mana barumsaa hin qabu ture
A lot has happened in that house.	Mana sana keessatti waan baay'ee ta'ee jira.
I can't do that.	Sana gochuu hin danda'u.
So it's nothing.	Kanaaf homaa miti.
I can't see anything	Homaa arguu hin danda'u
and all that.	fi sana hunda.
Only one person.	Nama tokko qofa.
Someone is watching from the other side	Namni tokko karaa biraa irraa ilaalaa jira
I still wasn't sure this was a good idea	Ammallee kun yaada gaarii akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I don't want to talk to you	Si waliin dubbachuu hin barbaadu
I want to make one thing clear.	Waan tokko ifa gochuu barbaada.
He doesn't want me.	Na hin barbaadu.
I couldn’t believe it, and she couldn’t believe it either	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye, isheen illee amanuu hin dandeenye
I love that stuff.	Waan sana baay'een jaalladha.
But he is not here.	Garuu as hin jiru.
I didn’t even know you had me	Na qabaachuu kee illee hin beeku ture
He had a question.	Gaaffii qaba ture.
I was right it was different	Ani sirrii ture adda ture
But now it seemed unnecessary.	Amma garuu waan hin barbaachifne fakkaata ture.
I need to make everything clear to you	Waan hundumaa siif ifa gochuun na barbaachisa
But that was a long time ago.	Garuu sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
He had no chance.	Carraa hin qabu ture.
I love this picture	Suuraa kana baay'een jaalladha
I need it in two hours	Sa'aatii lama keessatti na barbaachisa
I don't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu.
They are not all the same.	Hundi isaanii tokko miti.
We don't have time for that.	Kanaaf yeroo hin qabnu.
You need a lot of help.	Gargaarsa guddaa si barbaachisa.
Its easy.	Salphaa isaa.
They have similar feelings.	Miira wal fakkaatu qabu.
I knew it would never happen.	Yoomiyyuu akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
Didn't know you were one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu kee hin beekne.
I just mean that.	Ani akkasitti qofa jechuu kooti.
I love some things about you	Waa'ee kee waan tokko tokko nan jaalladha
I think you will love him	Isa ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
I should have given him more of my time	Silaa yeroo koo caalaa isaaf kennuu qaba ture
I never knew we were anything bad	Waan hamaa ta'uu keenya gonkumaa hin beeku ture
You are one.	Ati tokko.
This doesn't seem to work in my case.	Kun dhimma koo keessatti waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
I don't know where it is.	Eessa akka ta'e hin beeku.
There wasn't much in it.	Waan baay'een keessa hin turre.
All this waiting.	Kun hundi eegaa.
I can't say more than that.	Kana caalaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I'm just not sure about this one	Isa kanaa qofa mirkanaa'aa miti
They have two children, a boy and a girl.	Ijoollee lama gurbaa fi intala tokko qabu.
It's just a sound.	Sagalee qofa.
I can have a job, a wife and kids	Hojii, haadha manaa fi ijoollee qabaachuu nan danda'a
I was still in school.	Ammallee mana barumsaa ture.
You never know what you don’t know.	Waan hin beekne gonkumaa hin beektu.
Nothing else should happen.	Wanti biraa ta'uu hin qabu.
So it’s not like that.	Kanaaf akkas miti.
That’s why we were here.	Kanaaf as turre.
He couldn’t believe he had done the right thing	Waan sirrii akka hojjete amanuu hin dandeenye
I was the eye, watching	Ani ija ture, ilaalaa ture
Not so much, really.	Hanga kana miti, dhuguma.
They are now.	Amma jiru.
Someone who is different	Nama adda ta'e
. . . .	.
I think it’s a great thing.	Waan guddaa natti fakkaata.
It’s long and wide.	Dheeraa fi bal’aa dha.
That's how I can feel	Akkasitti miira qabaachuu nan danda'a
I don't know of such a case	Dhimma akkasii hin beeku
I was theirs now	Ani amma kan isaanii ture
I can't say that was the case this time.	Yeroo kana akkas ture jechuu hin danda'u.
I thought everyone knew that.	Kana namni hundi waan beeku natti fakkaate.
None of this was what we expected.	Kun hundi waan nuti yaadne hin turre.
I would have known now.	Silaa amma beeka ture.
I gave it the name of what was around me	Maqaa waan naannoo koo jiru itti kenne
To be clear, it's not.	Ifa ta'uuf, akkas miti.
It doesn't seem to be coming.	Kan dhufu hin fakkaatu.
I don’t know how to say it.	Akkamitti akkan jedhu hin beeku.
I may not be.	Ani ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
You can be a voice.	Sagalee ta'uu dandeessa.
I didn't know it would be like that	Akkas akka ta'u hin beeku ture
Some new clothes.	Uffata haaraa tokko tokko.
He is always here.	Yeroo hundumaa as jira.
I don't know about it	Ani waa'ee isaa hin beeku
Many have it now.	Baay'een amma qabu.
From my work.	Hojii koo irraa.
Nothing but space.	Bakka malee homaa hin jiru.
We agreed on that.	Sana irratti walii galle.
But that wasn’t the case, of course.	Garuu akkas hin turre beekamaadha.
It has to be this part.	Kutaa kana ta'uu qaba.
I really looked like my father	Ani dhuguma abbaa koo fakkaata ture
I want to play with you more	Caalaatti si waliin taphachuu barbaada
I wonder where he lives	Eessa jiraata jedheen yaada
A little, but not that much.	Xiqqoo, garuu hamma sana miti.
It wasn’t us.	Nu hin turre.
She did it several times.	Yeroo hedduu goote.
We went to school.	Mana barumsaa deemne.
All that matters is what we can do.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta’e maal gochuu akka dandeenyu qofa.
I have to go with her dog	Saree ishee waliin deemuun qaba
I don’t mean that at all	Ani tasumaa akkas jechuu koo miti
I didn't think all that had happened before	Wanti sun hundi duraan waan taʼe natti hin fakkaatu ture
As he talks about .	Akkuma inni waa'ee .
I wanted to talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu barbaade.
It wouldn't have been much.	Silaa waan baay'ee hin ta'u ture.
I can't believe it's just us	Nu qofa akka ta'e amanuu hin danda'u
That really should be .	Sun dhuguma ta'uu qaba .
He took what he wanted.	Waan barbaade fudhate.
It still works.	Ammas ni hojjeta.
I will definitely do this again.	Ammas kana gochuun koo hin oolu.
I don't know the name.	Maqaa hin beeku.
They were still there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti ammallee achi turan.
I never want to see them again.	Kana booda gonkumaa isaan arguu hin barbaadu.
But they do both together.	Garuu lamaan isaanii waliin ni godhu.
It obviously doesn’t work.	Akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
And I said that of course.	Anis akkas jedheen beekamaadha.
I'm not exactly sure why this happens.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u sirriitti hin beeku.
I love you and I am with you	Si jaalladha si waliin jira
I knew that couldn't happen	Wanti akkasii ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture
I mean, staying here	As turuu jechuu kooti
I know where it’s going	Eessa akka deemu nan beeka
I need you to find me some things	Waan tokko tokko akka naaf barbaaddu na barbaachisa
It's pretty good without it.	Isa malee baayyee gaarii dha.
Usually, this isn’t much of a problem.	Yeroo baay’ee, kun rakkoo guddaa miti.
I want you with me today	Har'a na waliin si barbaada
Tell him it’s dangerous.	Balaa akka qabu itti himi.
He just seems to have something to do.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf waan qabu qofa fakkaata.
I hope he tells us soon for sure	Yeroo dhiyootti akka nutti himu abdiin qaba mirkanaa'adha
It was late in the afternoon again.	Ammas waaree booda ture.
I'm just so glad to see you again	Ammas si arguu kootti baay'een gammade qofa
He knows what to do.	Waan godhu ni beeka.
Now I’m not here anymore.	Amma kana booda as hin jiru.
I know you can help her.	Ishee gargaaruu akka dandeessu nan beeka.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
I am new to it.	Ani haaraa dha.
I mean, he's probably not	Inni tarii hin ta'u jechuu kooti
Now look at him.	Amma isa ilaalaa.
I think maybe she was right	Tarii isheen sirrii turte jedheen yaada
You should be at work in an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko booda hojii irra jiraachuu qabda.
But he is here.	Inni garuu as jira.
This was really what was happening.	Dhuguma waan ta'aa ture kana ture.
That will never come.	Sun gonkumaa hin dhufu.
I think he spoke to me	Natti dubbate natti fakkaata
Maybe you can tell me.	Tarii natti himuu dandeessu ta'a.
Until recently that is.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti sun jechuun.
I had a lot of time alone	Kophaa koo yeroo baayʼee qaba ture
We both wanted it that way.	Lamaan keenyayyuu akkasitti barbaanne.
I like that whole soundtrack	Sagalee guutuu sana natti tola
She shouldn't be here.	Isheen as ta'uu hin qabdu.
Things no one else does.	Wantoota namni biraa hin hojjenne.
They were right about it.	Waa'ee isaa sirrii turan.
I think they were waiting for me to say something	Maal akkan jedhu na eegaa turan jedheen yaada
Two things are for sure.	Wanti lama mirkanaa'aa ta'uu isaa.
It just wasn’t an issue for him anymore.	Kana booda isaaf dhimma qofa hin turre.
I couldn't believe it.	Amanuu hin dandeenye.
This is probably a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta’uu hin oolu.
Tell me what to do.	Waan godhu natti himi.
The only proper answer to this is none.	Kanaaf deebii sirrii ta’e tokkollee kennuu qofa.
I made all of this happen	Kana hunda akka ta'u nan godhe
As it turns out this was not so.	Akkuma ta'e kun akkas hin turre.
He seems to be very interested.	Fedhii guddaa kan qabu fakkaata.
I couldn’t see her way	Karaa ishee arguu hin dandeenye
But this work is mine.	Garuu hojiin kun kan kooti.
I can't right now.	Yeroo ammaa hin danda'u.
I think it is possible	Ni danda'ama jedheen yaada
That was very true.	Sun baayʼee dhugaa ture.
This was on him.	Kun isa irra ture.
As he had done before.	Akkuma kanaan dura gochaa ture.
I just need to be alone	Kophaa ta'uu qofa na barbaachisa
I walked right up to him	Anis sirriitti gara isaatti ol ba'e
So I was happy with this dress.	Kanaaf uffata kanaan gammade.
The person will leave.	Namni sun ni deema.
But not my hands.	Garuu harka koo miti.
She would probably never know.	Isheen tarii gonkumaa hin beektu turte.
One is him.	Tokko isa.
I wondered how I could make it happen	Akkamitti akka ta'u gochuu danda'a jedheen yaade
I think it turned out really well.	Dhuguma gaarii ta'ee ba'e natti fakkaata.
I mean, with everything	Waan hundumaa wajjin jechuu kooti
Maybe I will too.	Tarii anis akkas nan godha ta'a.
He loves his new life.	Jireenya isaa haaraa ni jaallata.
It never happened before.	Duraan akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
He is a good people.	Inni namoota gaarii dha.
she said.	jette.
I want to be your husband	Ani abbaa manaa kee ta'uu barbaada
I can't do anything anymore	Kana booda waan tokko hojjechuu hin danda'u
I have nothing wrong with them	Isaan waliin waan hamaa hin qabu
I used to love her a lot	Duraan baay'een ishee jaalladha ture
But that is not the case here.	Garuu asitti akkas miti.
But it’s not just her car.	Garuu konkolaataa ishee qofa miti.
I said you can stay here for a few days	Guyyaa muraasaaf as turuu dandeessu jedheen
I need it early at night	Halkan dafee na barbaachisa
It worked really well for me.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti na hojjete.
I thought it wouldn’t work	Hin hojjetu jedheen yaade
Which is exactly what happened.	Kan ta'e sirriitti.
Then came the voice.	Sana booda sagalee dhufe.
Not good today.	Har'a gaarii miti.
All that kind of stuff.	Waan akkasii hunda.
It really is my life.	Dhuguma jireenya kooti.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
He should have returned a long time ago.	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura deebi'uu qaba ture.
Both of those are very helpful to me.	Sun lamaan baayʼee na gargaaru.
I never wanted to be one	Ani gonkumaa tokko ta'uu hin barbaanne
He is always watching you	Yeroo hundumaa isin ilaalaa jira
It went funny.	Qoosaa ta'ee deeme.
But I really didn’t understand how to do it.	Garuu dhuguma akkamitti akkan godhu naaf hin galle.
He didn’t do those things.	Wantoota sana hin hojjenne.
I love that sort of thing	Waan akkasii nan jaalladha
Not everything is what you think it is.	Wanti hundi akka ati yaaddu miti.
These were people who couldn’t go anywhere else.	Kun namoota bakka biraa deemuu hin dandeenye turan.
I couldn’t get enough of him	Isa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye
It had to be larger than life	Jireenya caalaa guddaa ta'uu qaba ture
Now we are not the only ones.	Amma nu qofa miti.
These people are not the same as us.	Namoonni kun nu waliin tokko miti.
Only, really.	Qofa, dhuguma.
He didn't understand what she said.	Waan isheen jette itti hin galle.
I told him what that was.	Sun maal akka ture itti hime.
It's like my thing.	Akka waan kooti.
I really had nothing to say	Dhuguma waanan jedhu hin qabu ture
Very good at home.	Mana keessatti baayyee gaarii dha.
He didn't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himne.
But the time was not now.	Yeroon garuu amma hin turre.
I would have no way of knowing, of course.	Silaa karaa itti beeku hin qabu ture, beekamaadha.
I wanted to talk to you alone	Kophaa koo sitti dubbachuu barbaade
He was truly a great man	Dhuguma nama guddaa ture
We didn’t say anything to each other.	Homaa wal hin dubbanne turre.
He was very happy.	Inni baay'ee gammade.
I won’t be here long	Yeroo dheeraa as hin jiru
Everything that makes them human.	Waan nama isaan godhu hunda.
It worked out well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete.
I don’t have a bar here.	Asitti mana dhugaatii hin qabu.
But hope was the worst.	Abdiin garuu hunda caalaa hamaa ture.
It didn’t last long	Yeroo dheeraaf hin turre
Everything had to be great.	Wanti hundi guddaa ta'uu qaba ture.
I didn’t want any of that part.	Kutaa sana keessaa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
I know this guy a lot	Gurbaa kana baay'een beeka
It was fine at the time.	Yeroo sanatti gaarii ture.
You never have to give me an excuse.	Gonkumaa sababa naaf kennuu hin qabdu.
I love her work so much	Hojii ishee baay'een jaalladha
They know little about you.	Waa'ee kee waan xiqqoo beeku.
It seemed like nobody did.	Namni waan hin goone fakkaata ture.
It is in good condition.	Haala gaarii irra jira.
I'm enjoying it.	Ani itti gammadeera.
I'm sure he's not going there	Achi akka hin deemne mirkanaa'adha
I wasn’t alone in this.	Kana keessatti kophaa koo hin turre.
It took a while, but that's what happened.	Yeroo fudhate, garuu kanuma ta'e.
Often, this isn’t true.	Yeroo baay’ee, kun dhugaa miti.
I love that too much	Sana garmalee nan jaalladha
He had no one in his life.	Jireenya isaa keessatti nama hin qabu ture.
So far so good, this is working.	Hanga ammaatti akkas gaarii, kun hojjechaa jira.
He was in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa ture.
That's it.	Kanuma.
I had said it.	Jedheen ture.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
I think he may be right though	Inni garuu dhugaa ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
All he needed was to eat.	Wanti isa barbaachisu nyaachuu ture.
I think it does.	Ni qaba jedheen yaada.
He didn't want to do that again	Ammas akkas gochuu hin barbaadu ture
So very lucky.	Kanaaf baayyee carraa.
That would have been something.	Silaa sun waan tokko ta'a ture.
That may not be the case.	Akkas taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
I wouldn’t go without her.	Ishee malee hin deemu ture.
Everything is working fine without any problems.	Rakkoo tokko malee wanti hundi gaarii hojjechaa jira.
Just a few hours, he thought.	Sa'aatii muraasa qofa jedhee yaade.
But he’s out there.	Garuu inni ala jira.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Garuu tarii sun waan gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
That should work.	Sun hojjechuu qaba.
I don't want that.	Ani akkas hin barbaadu.
I would have loved that.	Silaa sana nan jaalladha ture.
I want to be one of them	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu barbaada
He said that at a good time.	Yeroo gaarii akkas jedhe.
He is married and has three children.	Haadha manaa qaba, ijoollee sadii qaba.
He has to do something	Waan tokko gochuu qaba
I have nothing now.	Amma homaa hin qabu.
I mean my whole life	Jireenya koo guutuu jechuu kooti
I didn’t want to know.	Ani beekuu hin barbaanne.
Not so like her.	Akkas akka ishee miti.
I wouldn’t have thought about it	Silaa itti hin yaadu ture
You're nothing much.	Ati homaa hin baay'ee.
It's going to me.	Gara kootti deemaa jira.
I can't say more than that	Kana caalaa jechuu hin danda'u
Join us now!.	Amma nu waliin ta'aa!.
All those things.	Wantoota sana hunda.
I love this new feel	Miira haaraa kana baay'een jaalladha
This was all about me.	Kun hundi waaʼee koo ture.
None of this seemed true.	Kun tokkollee dhugaa hin fakkaatu ture.
It was everywhere	Bakka hunda ture
I knew she would love it	Akka isheen jaallattu nan beeka ture
They know everything.	Waan hundumaa beeku.
It just seemed like the right thing to do	Waan sirrii ta'e qofa natti fakkaate
Good drinking time	Yeroo dhugaatii gaarii
That doesn't happen much anymore.	Kana booda sun baay'ee hin ta'u.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
Not until now.	Hanga ammaatti miti.
Today I just can't work on it anymore.	Har'a kana booda irratti hojjechuu qofa hin danda'u.
I couldn’t speak anymore	Kana booda dubbachuu hin dandeenye
Maybe you are, maybe you're not.	Tarii ati jirta, tarii hin jirtu ta'a.
Something is not right, again.	Wanti tokko sirrii miti, ammas.
I want to make that clear already	Sana duruu ifa gochuu barbaada
I just didn’t have that	Ani akkas qofa hin qabu ture
Not everyone could do that.	Namni hundi akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I said as much.	Anis hamma sana jedhe.
I wanted to do something like that	Waan akkasii hojjechuu nan barbaada ture
A husband she didn’t want	Abbaa manaa isheen hin barbaanne
I can get that.	Sana argachuu nan danda'a.
What he saw.	Waan inni arge.
I need something real	Wanti dhugaa ta'e na barbaachisa
I made it work for him.	Akka itti hojjetu nan godhe.
He had a very good life.	Jireenya baayyee gaarii qaba ture.
I just can't do it.	Qofa gochuu hin danda'u.
We are at my house.	Mana koo jirra.
That’s how it worked with us.	Akkasitti nu waliin hojjete.
You don't want to.	Hin barbaaddu.
I can't stop talking	Dubbachuu dhiisuu hin danda'u
It was a great place.	Bakka guddaa ture.
I didn’t want to live without him	Isa malee jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I want you to do something for me.	Waan tokko akka naaf gootu nan barbaada.
They didn’t have anything right.	Waan sirrii hin qaban turan.

I needed a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee na barbaachisa ture.
A man without a place	Nama bakka hin qabne
I just couldn’t see anything	Homaa arguu qofa hin dandeenye
I can't believe what just happened	Waan amma ta'e amanuu hin danda'u
Up went my hands and my shoes.	Harka koo fi kophee koo ol deeme.
He wanted to stay together	Waliin turuu barbaade
It may not have been right here.	Asitti sirriitti hin turre ta'a.
I know, big mistake.	Ani beeka, dogoggora guddaa.
I want to be us.	Ani nu ta'uu barbaada.
I doubt this is true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa nan shakka.
This is not the help she needs.	Kun gargaarsa ishee barbaachisu miti.
I passed it by this morning	Ganama kana bira darbe
I should never have come here	Silaa gonkumaa as dhufuu hin qabu ture
I am new to it.	Ani haaraa dha.
I like it really good.	Ani dhuguma gaarii natti tola.
For this time.	Yeroo kanaaf.
No one was there.	Namni achi ture hin turre.
I hope it will be one.	Tokko akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
You can think of it.	Yaadu dandeessa.
If you don’t, it won’t work.	Yoo hin goone hin hojjetu.
I just need to do these things alone	Wantoota kana kophaa koo hojjechuu qofa na barbaachisa
I thought he was gone	Inni waan hin jirre natti fakkaate
They want to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu barbaadu.
He would have known.	Silaa ni beeka ture.
I can never see her again	Kana booda gonkumaa ishee arguu hin danda'u
She needs to find a place.	Bakka argachuu qabdi.
I'm sure it wasn't.	Akka hin turre mirkanaa'adha.
I don’t know that at all	Sana tasumaa hin beeku
Hope all turns out well	Hundi akka gaariitti akka ta'u abdii qabna
She doesn't care about him.	Isheen waa'ee isaaf dhimma hin qabdu.
I love them so much	Baay'een isaan jaalladha
I need her to want me	Isheen akka na barbaaddu na barbaachisa
Something wasn’t right.	Wanti tokko sirrii hin turre.
Maybe he's in danger.	Tarii balaa keessa jiraachuu danda'a.
That's not going to happen with you.	Si waliin akkas ta'uuf hin deemu.
I wouldn’t want to be in your shoes	Kophee kee keessa jiraachuu hin barbaadu ture
I should have told you sooner	Silaa dafee sitti himuu qaba ture
Not sure though.	Mirkanaa'aa miti garuu.
I had to do something	Waan tokko gochuun qaba ture
He was the one she wanted.	Inni isa isheen barbaaddu ture.
I knew he had me.	Na akka qabu nan beeka ture.
There is nothing for him but to go.	Deemu malee homaa isaaf hin jiru.
When it is appropriate to do so.	Yeroo akkas gochuun sirrii ta'u.
You have to believe that.	Sana amanuu qabda.
It makes one thing clear	Waan tokko ifa godha
There is nothing.	Homaa hin jiru.
Again, we are human beings.	Ammas nuti nama dha.
I wanted them on mine more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa kan koo irratti isaan barbaade
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
They come often.	Yeroo baayyee dhufu.
But sometimes something happens.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko wanti tokko ni ta'a.
I just didn’t know what to do	Maal akkan godhu qofa hin beeku ture
I was just trying to do my job	Hojii koo hojjechuuf qofa yaalaa ture
We can’t do it.	Hin dandeenyu.
I wonder who it could be	Eenyu ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
He can go as far as he wants.	Hamma barbaade deemuu danda’a.
I know a lot, you know	Ani waan baay'ee beeka, beekta
That's pretty long.	Sana baayyee dheeraa.
I can't tell you now	Amma sitti himuu hin danda'u
It wasn’t like that before.	Duraan akkas hin turre.
But it was pretty bad.	Garuu baayyee hamaa ture.
Too much of it.	Garmalee baay'ee.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Most of the time that doesn't work.	Yeroo baayyee sun hin hojjetu.
I like what you are	Waan taate natti tola
This is certainly a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii akka taʼe beekamaadha.
No one wanted to give him a job.	Namni hojii isaaf kennuu barbaade hin turre.
They would be on their way though.	Silaa karaa irra jiru garuu.
I didn’t know where he was	Eessa akka jiru hin beeku ture
It does exactly the same thing.	Sirriitti kanuma hojjeta.
She didn’t know his name.	Maqaa isaa hin beektu turte.
It didn’t work for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf hin hojjenne
That was the problem here.	Rakkoon asitti ture kanuma ture.
He knew every sound by now	Sagalee hunda yeroo ammaatti beeka ture
Then I knew what it was	Sana booda maal akka ta'e nan beeka ture
We have a lot around my work.	Naannoo hojii kootti waan baay'ee qabna.
Now he was the exception.	Amma kan ala ta'e isa ture.
I want to get to know her	Ishee beekuu barbaada
The mother of the boy.	Haadha gurbaa.
Can anyone please help me.	Namni mee na gargaaru jiraa.
I could do some things.	Waan tokko tokko hojjechuu nan danda'a ture.
But even that may be too late.	Garuu sun illee yeroon booda ta’uu danda’a.
I’ve known for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf beeka.
I wasn't sure what she wanted	Waan isheen barbaaddu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I always do it.	Yeroo hundumaa nan godha.
I want to ask about your wife, that's all.	Waa'ee haadha manaa kee gaafachuu barbaada, kana qofa.
He has enough money.	Maallaqa gahaa qaba.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
That will never happen.	Sun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
No one likes to talk about them.	Namni waa'ee isaanii dubbachuu jaallatu hin jiru.
I can't see you, just me	Si arguu hin danda'u, ana qofa
This works fine for me.	Kun gaarii naaf hojjeta.
Certainly not today.	Har'a akka hin taane beekamaadha.
You can’t just do one thing.	Waan tokko qofa hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
I didn’t think you were interested	Fedhii qabda jedhee hin yaadne
A place as unique as you are	Bakka akkuma kee adda ta'e
He has everything	Waan hundumaa qaba
You have to be together.	Waliin ta'uu qabdu.
He didn't tell anyone	Namatti hin himne
It seemed to do.	Waan godhu fakkaata ture.
I still can't believe it, really.	Ammallee amanuu hin danda'u, dhuguma.
A lot of things.	Waan baay'ee.
But that was all right.	Garuu sun hundi sirrii ture.
That is a possibility.	Sun taʼuu dandaʼa.
Great thing, it happens.	Waan guddaa, ni ta'a.
I'm not sure he knows	Inni akka beeku mirkanaa'aa miti
I still can't believe any of this is happening	Ammallee kana keessaa tokkollee ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t understand any of this.	Kana keessaa tokkollee hin hubanne.
I didn't know it would be like that	Akkas akka ta'u hin beeku ture
It was just too much.	Garmalee qofa ture.
I thought about it a lot	Waa'ee kanaa baay'een yaade
Now look at it.	Amma ilaalaa.
Lots of bad people there.	Namoota hamaa baay'ee achitti.
What they do to people.	Waan nama irratti godhu.
What we need to do.	Waan gochuu qabnu.
I think that's the case.	Ani akkas jedheen yaada.
I think we have a good chance	Carraa gaarii qabna jedheen yaada
I couldn’t recognize them.	Isaan beekuu hin dandeenye.
I have a problem with that part	Kutaa sana irratti rakkoon qaba
You just didn’t want him to come to you.	Akka inni sitti dhufu qofa hin barbaanne.
Sometimes he wanted to ask her why.	Yeroo tokko tokko maaliif akka taʼe ishee gaafachuu barbaada ture.
Sorry it was my opinion	Dhiifama yaada koo ture
I didn't really know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti hin beeku ture
I don't have to say that.	Ani akkas jechuu hin qabu.
I have no problem with that, except for one thing.	Sana irratti rakkoo hin qabu, waan tokko malee.
It wants something long, but not too long	Waan dheeraa barbaada, garuu baay'ee dheeraa miti
I wasn’t going to do that	Ani akkas gochuuf hin turre
I'm sorry I went so far.	Hanga kana deeme dhiifama.
It wasn’t great before.	Duraan guddaa hin turre.
I think that will be enough	Sun gahaa ta'a jedheen yaada
This wasn’t working.	Kun hojjechaa hin turre.
I didn't say anything to him.	Ani homaa itti hin dubbanne.
I wanted something different.	Waan adda ta'e barbaade.
I didn't want this to happen	Kun akka ta'u hin barbaanne
I think that's what's important	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e kanuma natti fakkaata
It's just a life.	Jiraa qofa.
No one else around.	Nama biraa naannoo hin jiru.
One question though.	Gaaffii tokko garuu.
Soon after that he got a feeling inside himself.	Sana booda yeroo muraasa booda of keessaa miira argate.
I can't tell you how much.	Meeqa akka ta'e sitti himuu hin danda'u.
Who gave me the idea.	Kan yaada naaf kenne.
It was true enough, but not enough.	Dhugaa gahaa ture, garuu gahaa hin turre.
I shouldn’t have gone	Silaa deemuu hin qabu ture
He does a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjeta.
I know what you are	Maal akka taate nan beeka
Look into his eyes again.	Ammas ija isaatiin ilaalaa.
When no one else does.	Yeroo namni biraa hin goone.
I went to my house	Gara mana kootti deeme
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
I have been with you for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isin waliin ture
He was my hand.	Inni harka koo ture.
I know all about that	Waa'ee sanaa hunda nan beeka
I don’t have children’s voices.	Sagalee ijoollee hin qabu.
There was nothing she could say.	Wanti isheen jechuu dandeessu hin turre.
But there is no need to overreact.	Garuu garmalee deebii kennuu hin barbaachisu.
I think it will work for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ni hojjeta jedheen yaada
But none of us could help him.	Garuu nu keessaa tokkollee isa gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
Hers was an opportunity here and now.	Kan ishee carraa asitti fi amma ture ture.
I mean genuine desire	Fedhii dhugaa jechuu kooti
I knew she was waiting	Akka eegaa jirtu nan beeka ture
I love everything about you	Waa'ee kee waan hundumaa nan jaalladha
I haven’t met him yet	Ammallee isa waliin wal hin argine
There were too many of us.	Garmalee baay'ee turre.
I'm going to be bad	Ani hamaa ta'uuf deema
I didn't think about it.	Ani itti hin yaadne.
I didn't really know why	Maaliif akka ta'e dhuguma hin beeku ture
I think this is happening with a lot of people	Kun namoota hedduu waliin ta'aa jira jedheen yaada
I can't just go for nothing	Homaa tokko malee qofa deemuu hin danda'u
But you can answer.	Garuu deebii kennuu dandeessa.
I have good days but I have even worse days.	Guyyaa gaarii qaba garuu kana caalaa guyyaa hamaa qaba.
In the past month.	Ji'a darbe keessa.
But we can’t afford it anymore.	Garuu kana booda qarshii hin dandeenyu.
That is often not the case.	Yeroo baayʼee akkas miti.
I have no idea what it was.	Maal akka ture yaada hin qabu.
I can't believe you would do that to me	Akkas na gootu jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I know who you are.	Eenyu akka taate nan beeka.
I didn’t tell him anything but he knew.	Ani homaa itti hin himne garuu inni beeka ture.
I was just the guy who said, all	Ani gurbaa jedhe qofa ture, hunda
I know her better than you do	Ani si caalaa ishee beeka
I didn’t know anything.	Ani homaa hin beeku ture.
I was like that.	Ani akkas ture.
I was only here a week	Torban tokko qofa as ture
I knew something was going on with him	Waan tokko akka isa waliin deemaa jiru nan beeka ture
It wasn’t my business.	Dhimma koo hin turre.
It seemed like a hopeless task.	Hojii abdii hin qabne fakkaata ture.
I didn't want to be that person	Ani nama sana ta'uu hin barbaanne
It was like that for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkas ture
I think he knows better	Inni kana caalaa waan beeku natti fakkaata
He had to think.	Yaadu qaba ture.
Clearly, he did not.	Akkas akka hin goone ifaadha.
That could not be right.	Sun sirrii taʼuu hin dandaʼu ture.
If that were the case.	Osoo akkas ta'ee.
I was becoming human	Ani nama ta'aa ture
Look at your children.	Ijoollee keessan ilaalaa.
It will be good for him.	Isaaf gaarii ta'a.
I'm sure you'll love it	Akka jaallattu mirkanaa'adha
I hadn’t spoken to her in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf ishee waliin hin dubbanne ture
I didn't know anything	Ani homaa hin beekne
He was always here.	Yeroo hundumaa as ture.
I probably shouldn't tell you any of this	Kana keessaa tokkollee sitti himuu hin qabu ta'a
I had the same feeling	Anis miira wal fakkaatu qaba ture
Until it’s mine.	Hamma kan kooti.
Unless you do something.	Waan tokko yoo goote malee.
That’s how much the person is.	Namni sun hamma sana.
I didn't want to go back there	Achitti deebi'uu hin barbaanne
I think that would have been nice.	Silaa sun gaarii ture jedheen yaada.
I don't come here very often	Yeroo baayyee as hin dhufu
I saw another question about this here.	Waa'ee kanaa gaaffii biraa asitti arge.
I really didn’t know what to say	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
I just can't get a job	Hojii argachuu qofa hin danda'u
There and there.	Achi fi achi.
Must.	Dirqama.
But then, I never could.	Garuu sana booda, gonkumaa hin dandeenye.
Think about it.	Mee yaadu.
It’s not a dog then.	Yeroo sana saree miti.
It's more than you think.	Kan ati yaaddu caalaa ta'a.
Look at us now.	Amma nu ilaalaa.
I thought this would work	Kun ni hojjeta jedheen yaade
I think that helps tremendously	Sun gargaarsa guddaa qaba jedheen yaada
Doing it again would be different.	Ammas gochuun adda ta'a.
I can't tell you any more	Kana caalaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
It's not going.	Deemaa hin jiru.
I was my age before him	Ani umuriin koo isa dura ture
You know one thing.	Tokko ni beekta.
It's going pretty well so far.	Hanga ammaatti baayyee gaarii ta'ee deemaa jira.
It may not be you.	Si ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
Someone looked into his eyes.	Namni tokko ija isaa keessaa ilaale.
I didn’t want to give the impression that you weren’t	Ati akka hin taane yaada kennuu hin barbaanne
He found her.	Ishee argate.
I can't do that here	Asitti akkas gochuu hin danda'u
I think you really need it	Dhuguma si barbaachisa jedheen yaada
I know that house.	Mana sana nan beeka.
I can get it with all of life	Jireenya hundumaa wajjin argachuu nan danda'a
But it was none of her business.	Garuu dhimma ishee hin turre.
We have to do that in the car.	Konkolaataa keessatti sana gochuu qabna.
I would love some of your comments.	Yaada keessan tokko tokko baay'een jaalladha.
I just can't say any more	Kana caalaa jechuu qofa hin danda'u
Like who you are.	Akka eenyu akka taate.
No more is needed.	Kana caalaa hin barbaachisu.
We have a whole day.	Guyyaa guutuu qabna.
This seems bad.	Kun hamaa fakkaata.
I am one of those people	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko
But it wasn’t and it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre hin turre.
I didn’t want anyone else around	Nama biraa naannoo sana jiraachuu hin barbaanne
It is possible, however.	Ni danda'ama garuu.
I don't care	Ani dhimma hin qabu
Without her consent.	Fedhii ishee malee.
Let's talk about.	Mee waa'ee.
I couldn’t see anything.	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
But you didn’t.	Garuu ati hin taane.
He looked like his father.	Abbaa isaa fakkaata ture.
I can't tell you what it is	Maal akka ta'e sitti himuu hin danda'u
I want to know if it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekuu barbaada.
So, we have to do it.	Kanaaf, gochuu qabna.
He says it's going to be good, but he knows it.	Gaarii ta'uuf deema jedha, garuu ni beeka.
It was going to be a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii ta'uuf ture.
I am sure you will love this idea	Yaada kana akka jaallattu mirkanaa'adha
I don’t think it was my idea	Yaada koo ture natti hin fakkaatu
It looks like him.	Isa fakkaata.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
This would have been a disaster and a mistake.	Silaa kun balaa fi dogoggora ta’a ture.
It couldn’t be.	Ta’uu hin dandeenye.
He had a few friends out there.	Hiriyyoota muraasa achi keessaa qaba ture.
But I can't live without books.	Ani garuu kitaaba malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
I will not be one of them	Ani isaan keessaa tokko hin ta'u
She was still with him.	Ammallee isa waliin turte.
We need more than desire.	Fedhii caalaa waan nu barbaachisa.
I can still say that	Ammas akkas jechuu danda'a
He had that right.	Inni sana sirriitti qaba ture.
He could have had it.	Inni qabaachuu danda'a ture.
It would be a good thing.	Waan gaarii ta'a.
I can't really talk about that	Dhuguma waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
There must be.	Jiraachuu qaba.
I love everyone here	Nama as jiru hunda nan jaalladha
There is only one problem.	Rakkoon tokko qofa.
But it is not the same as existence.	Garuu jiraachuu wajjin tokko miti.
He wanted to see her again	Ammas ishee arguu barbaade
I don’t mean then	Yeroo sana jechuu koo miti
She is not alone.	Isheen kophaa ishee miti.
As you do again.	Akkuma ammas gootu.
I wasn't sure about it	Waa'ee isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
That certainly hasn’t happened yet.	Sun hanga ammaatti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Sorry it wasn’t sooner.	Dhiifama dafee hin turre.
It seems so obvious now.	Amma akkas ifa fakkaata.
What happens.	Wanti ta'u.
None of that belongs to me.	Sana keessaa tokkollee kan koo miti.
Sounds like a lot went over it.	Waan baay'een irra deeme fakkaata.
It seemed so real.	Akkas dhugaa fakkaata ture.
You have the answer now.	Deebii isaa amma qabda.
I mean, she’s right here	Isheen sirriitti asitti jechuu kooti
He is looking for the truth.	Dhugaa barbaadaa jira.
He was a very good man.	Nama baayyee gaarii ture.
They wouldn’t have needed it, really.	Silaa isaan hin barbaachisu ture, dhuguma.
The problem will be elsewhere.	Rakkoon bakka biraa ta'a.
I could do it in my sleep	Hirriba koo keessatti gochuu nan danda'a ture
I couldn't have been more wrong	Kana caalaa dogoggora qabaachuu hin danda'u ture
I love you, you are my life	Si jaalladha, ati jireenya kooti
It may not be the case.	Ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
This is not true.	Kun dhugaa miti.
I know her father	Abbaa ishee nan beeka
Look what's happening up there.	Mee ilaalaa waan achi ol ta'aa jiru.
I really mean this time.	Dhuguma yeroo kana jechuu kooti.
It wasn’t around.	Naannoo hin turre.
I mean, please.	Mee jechuu kooti.
There was nothing she could say, nothing she could do.	Wanti isheen jechuu dandeessu, wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
It shouldn't be more than that.	Kana caalaa ta'uu hin qabu.
One of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko.
No one had to say anything.	Namni homaa dubbachuu hin qabu ture.
I wonder who gave you that idea	Yaada sana eenyutu siif kenne jedheen yaada
I think he knows something	Waan tokko waan beeku natti fakkaata
It was a disaster.	Balaa ture.
I can't talk about it	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
That should do it.	Sun gochuu qaba.
Perhaps he is right.	Tarii sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I was not one of them	Ani isaan keessaa tokko hin turre
I need him to be there.	Isa na barbaachisa.
He never, ever, ever did .	Inni gonkumaa, gonkumaa, gonkumaa hin goone .
He didn’t want to go.	Inni deemuu hin barbaanne ture.
They’ve been doing things for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf waan hojjechaa turan.
I have no idea how.	Akkamitti akka ta'u yaada hin qabu.
I couldn’t have that.	Sana qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
I still went to their house sometimes	Ammas yeroo tokko tokko gara mana isaanii nan deema ture
I am sure you will.	Akka gootu mirkanaa'adha.
Enjoyed it while it lasted	Osoo turuu itti gammade
I knew he was doing something	Waan hojjechaa akka jiru nan beeka ture
He was in the car at the time	Yeroo sana konkolaataa keessa ture
They were very good to us.	Isaan baayyee gaarii nuuf turan.
I feel good about coming here	As dhufuu kootti miira gaarii qaba
Not like himself today.	Har'a akka ofii miti.
But he never does.	Garuu gonkumaa hin godhu.
I want to know what's going on in here	As keessa maal akka ta'e beekuu barbaada
You’re not the only one, you know.	Ati qofa miti beekta.
This was no such book.	Kun kitaaba akkasii hin turre.
I can help you with that.	Sana irratti si gargaaruu nan danda'a.
But it’s not him.	Garuu isa miti.
I’ve always wanted you	Yeroo hundumaa si barbaada ture
Take a look!.	Mee ilaalaa!.
It is in very good condition.	Haala baayyee gaarii irra jira.
I have a dog.	Ani saree qaba.
He must know that it is true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa beekuu qaba
I totally didn't want that to happen	Ani guutummaatti akkas akka ta'u hin barbaanne
Now we have them again.	Amma ammas isaan qabna.
But it looks pretty bad now.	Garuu amma baayyee hamaa fakkaata.
You don’t want it that way.	Akkasitti hin barbaaddu.
Me, and only me.	Ana, fi ana qofa.
There is no time.	Yeroon hin jiru.
He has eyes, you know	Ija qaba isin beekta
I didn’t need anything else from him	Isa biraa waan biraa na hin barbaachifne
We need to know what tells us who did it.	Waan eenyu akka hojjete nutti himu beekuu qabna.
I hadn’t seen her.	Ishee hin argine ture.
But it’s not working.	Garuu hojjechaa hin jiru.
I was sure it would turn out well	Akka gaariitti akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa ture
The problem must be something else.	Rakkoon jiru waan biraa ta'uu qaba.
That wasn’t how it was supposed to go.	Akkasitti deemuu qabu hin turre.
But that time doesn’t seem to matter now.	Garuu yeroon sun amma homaa hin fakkaatu.
It doesn't happen much.	Baay'ee hin ta'u.
I really have to go	Dhuguma deemuun qaba
I can tell him more tomorrow	Boru kana caalaa itti himuu nan danda'a
I'm sure we can do it.	Hojjechuu akka dandeenyu mirkanaa'adha.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
I didn't expect that to happen	Sana akka ta'u hin yaadne
But that’s no help for us now.	Garuu sun amma nuuf gargaarsa hin qabu.
They love it.	Isaan ni jaallatu.
Work.	Hojii.
I want to live life with you	Jireenya si waliin jiraachuu barbaada
That’s how this thing started.	Wanti kun akkasitti jalqabe.
It wouldn’t go any further.	Kana caalaa hin deemu ture.
It didn’t work long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin hojjenne.
They were just watching their kids.	Ijoollee isaanii qofa ilaalaa turan.
I know this is not always the case	Kun yeroo hunda akka hin taane nan beeka
It was becoming a very serious problem	Rakkoo baayyee hamaa ta'aa ture
A good thing, of course.	Waan gaarii ta'e beekamaadha.
He couldn't see any more than he could	Kan inni danda'u caalaa arguu hin dandeenye
It might not work.	Tarii hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
How she was looking right at me.	Akkamitti isheen sirriitti na ilaalaa turte.
I can't go back just yet	Amma qofa deebi'uu hin danda'u
This one is probably the easiest one.	Inni kun tarii kan salphaa ta'uu hin oolu.
I couldn’t find one	Tokko argachuu hin dandeenye
I told him there was no way.	Karaa hin qabu jedheen itti hime.
But that doesn’t make them wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora isaan hin godhu.
If it is not great.	Yoo guddaa hin taane.
I say not at all	Ani tasumaa miti jedha
I couldn’t stay with her any longer	Kana booda ishee bira turuu hin dandeenye
That was enough.	Kana gahaa ture.
Not in the same place.	Bakka tokko miti.
She’s not the only one.	Ishee qofa miti.
I can tell nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa himuu hin danda'u.
I totally did that.	Ani guutummaatti akkas godhe.
It says that.	Akkas jedha.
But this is it.	Garuu isa kana.
I wasn’t looking at it that way	Ani akkasitti hin ilaalaa ture
I didn't think about that.	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne.
I can't be with you right now	Yeroo ammaa kana si bira jiraachuu hin danda'u
But now it was nothing.	Amma garuu homaa hin turre.
He is on his own.	Inni ofuma isaatiin jira.
It’s doing great so far.	Hanga ammaatti guddaa hojjechaa jira.
He was still in it.	Ammallee keessa ture.
He wanted to know about her condition	Waa'ee haala ishee beekuu barbaade
I was just looking at it.	Ani qofa ilaalaa ture.
I knew the way.	Karaa nan beeka ture.
I hadn’t seen them there before.	Kanaan dura achitti isaan hin argine ture.
Everyone can have an opinion.	Namni hundi yaada qabaachuu danda'a.
He was lucky though.	Carraa qaba ture garuu.
One person	Namni tokko .
I can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin danda'u.
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
This is an issue.	Kun dhimma.
I hope everyone enjoyed this meal	Namni hundi nyaata kana akka itti gammade abdiin qaba
I am not myself.	Ani ofii koo miti.
And it's happened again.	Ammas ta'ee jira.
Three.	Sadii.
But we can no longer be anything else.	Garuu kana booda waan biraa ta'uu hin dandeenyu.
I just had no idea what to do with them	Maal akkan isaan godhu qofa yaada hin qabu ture
I suspect that's all	Kana qofa akka ta'e nan shakka
Not sure if this is a good thing or not.	Kun waan gaarii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
I knew everything I needed to know	Waan beekuu qabu hunda nan beeka ture
I had no idea what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru homaa hin qabu ture
I didn't know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
Just a little thing, really	Waan xiqqoo qofa, dhuguma
He should have said it.	Silaa jechuu qaba ture.
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
So sorry for that.	Kanaaf dhiifama.
Just a little bit more .	Xiqqoo caalaa qofa .
I definitely wanted to help my mom, though	Haadha koo gargaaruu akkan barbaade beekamaadha, garuu
I needed something simple	Waan salphaa taʼe na barbaachisa ture
Not in this way.	Haala kanaan miti.
Now you can find her in there.	Amma achi keessa ishee argachuu dandeessa.
You think it's true.	Dhugaa sitti fakkaata.
That sounds like a good idea.	Sun yaada gaarii fakkaata.
I don’t know enough to say otherwise.	Akkas miti jechuun gahaa hin beeku.
He had to get help.	Gargaarsa argachuu qaba ture.
I knew it was coming.	Akka dhufu nan beeka ture.
Then it became a book	Sana booda kitaaba ta'e
The two of them are one.	Lamaan isaanii tokko.
But maybe it would be different then.	Garuu tarii yeroo sanatti adda ta'uu danda'a.
It is working without any problems.	Rakkoo tokko malee hojjechaa jira.
Something that is not right.	Waan sirrii hin taane.
He looked at my hand	Harka koo ilaale
He can't do it.	Inni gochuu hin danda'u.
It was just him, nothing more.	Inni qofa ture, kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
I hadn’t done my job	Hojii koo hin hojjenne ture
He loves her.	Ishee ni jaallata.
You can see it in his eyes.	Ija isaa keessatti arguu dandeessa.
They were around.	Isaan naannoo sana turan.
All of it.	Hundi isaa.
But this rarely happens.	Garuu kun yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
But that didn’t happen for us.	Garuu sun nuuf hin taane.
I have a job for you	Hojii siif qaba
I wasn't about to let that happen	Ani akkas akka ta'uuf hin turre
I had not realized how many people that really was	Dhuguma sun namoota meeqa akka taʼe hin hubanne ture
What do they say	Maal jedhu .
He knows exactly what he means, and what he thinks.	Maal jechuu isaa, fi maal akka yaadu sirriitti beeka.
He shouldn't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
So they were here for a while.	Kanaaf yeroo muraasaaf as turan.
But what can I tell you.	Garuu maal sitti himi.
Not so much.	Hanga kana miti.
Not me, of course.	Ana miti, beekamaadha.
A very long way.	Karaa baayyee dheeraa.
I wanted to believe it was.	Akkas ta'uu isaa amanuu barbaade.
You won’t do it anymore.	Kana booda hin gootu.
I didn’t talk to you	Sitti hin dubbanne
I really enjoyed doing that.	Sana gochuun baay'een gammade.
This was great.	Kun guddaa ture.
It didn’t look new anymore	Kana booda haaraa hin fakkaatu ture
It is not necessary for this case.	Dhimma kanaaf barbaachisaa miti.
But that’s not a good reason.	Garuu sun sababa gaarii miti.
He loves that.	Sana ni jaallata.
She had no answers.	Deebii tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
I know you weren’t yourself	Ati ofii kee akka hin turre nan beeka
But when you love them you just can’t get enough.	Garuu yeroo isaan jaallattu gahaa argachuu qofa hin dandeessu.
I just need a little time	Yeroo xiqqoo qofa na barbaachisa
Glad to be of help.	Gargaarsa ta'uu kootti gammadeera.
I knew I would never see him again	Kana booda akka isa hin argine nan beeka ture
He wasn’t home yet.	Ammallee mana hin turre.
I thought it was a joke	Qoosaa natti fakkaate
I don’t understand any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee naaf hin galle.
Maybe he's right.	Tarii sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
I can do that for you	Ani akkas siif gochuu nan danda'a
It doesn’t go away for long	Yeroo dheeraa hin deemu
You can't tell.	Himuu hin dandeessu.
I can get work done quickly	Hojii dafee hojjechuu nan danda'a
Not even that long.	Yeroo dheeraa sana illee miti.
This was something completely new	Kun waan guutummaatti haaraa ture
Our morning, his afternoon.	Ganama keenya, waaree booda isaa.
But maybe not.	Garuu tarii hin ta'u.
I love when that happens	Yeroo sun ta'u nan jaalladha
They are going about their daily lives.	Jireenya isaanii guyyaa guyyaa deemaa jiru.
If it were me, I would doubt that.	Osoo ana ta'ee sana nan shakka ture.
I have to do this.	Kana gochuun qaba.
You need to know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qabda.
I know it wasn’t	Akka hin turre nan beeka
But it is not necessary.	Garuu hin barbaachisu.
But it wouldn't be for long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraaf hin ta'u ture.
This.	Kana.
It had to be important.	Kan barbaachisaa ta’uu qaba ture.
But it's not clear what that means.	Garuu sun maal jechuu akka ta'e ifa miti.
But there is something going on.	Garuu waan deemaa jiru jira.
Everything else looks fine.	Wanti biraa hundi gaarii fakkaata.
It just started two weeks ago	Torban lama dura qofa jalqabe
Maybe we were.	Tarii nuti turre ta'a.
We are working on this now.	Kana irratti amma hojjechaa jirra.
I didn’t see that one.	Isa sana hin argine.
I want to be with you.	Si waliin ta'uu barbaada.
He just doesn’t come.	Inni qofa hin dhufu.
I think he really enjoyed it	Dhuguma itti gammade natti fakkaata
I didn’t want to see it	Ani arguu hin barbaanne
But that doesn’t work.	Garuu sun hin hojjetu.
I think he saw something he didn’t tell me	Waan natti hin himne waan arge natti fakkaata
I hope someone knows the answer.	Deebii isaa namni akka beeku abdiin qaba.
You can't be.	Ta'uu hin dandeessu.
You have to know what you are doing.	Waan gootu beekuu qabda.
It hasn’t been there yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin turre.
I didn’t mean anything negative by that	Kana jechuun waan hamaa jechuu koo hin turre
I can't see why that would be.	Maaliif akkas akka ta'u arguu hin danda'u.
I can't believe I didn't see her here	Asitti ishee hin argine jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
He never did it.	Inni gonkumaa hin goone.
They could, but they couldn't.	Ni danda'u turan, garuu hin dandeenye.
I should have done this	Silaa kana gochuun qaba ture
From just giving up drinking.	Dhugaatii dhiisuu qofa irraa.
I mean, look at this	Kana ilaalaa jechuu kooti
They love playing with him.	Isa waliin taphachuu ni jaallatu.
I want to know everything that is going on	Waan deemaa jiru hunda beekuu barbaada
It may even stay that way for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf illee akkasitti turuu danda'a.
I really didn’t understand anything anymore	Dhuguma kana booda homaa naaf hin galle
Look at that moment.	Yeroo sana ilaalaa.
I know he’s just around	Inni naannoo qofa akka jiru nan beeka
Some bad stuff.	Waan hamaa tokko tokko.
I just couldn’t do that to him.	Ani akkas isa gochuu hin dandeenye qofa.
He just looked at him	Isa qofa ilaale
But seeing something more.	Garuu waan caalaatti arguu.
I don't know anything about you.	Waa'ee kee homaa hin beeku.
I just can't get it on the handle	Qabduu qofa irratti argachuu hin danda'u
We did some things.	Waan tokko tokko hojjenne.
He is still doing something new.	Ammas waan haaraa hojjechaa jira.
You have to get it.	Argachuu qabda.
I don’t really know what to do	Maal akkan godhu sirriitti hin beeku
It was such a great idea.	Yaada guddaa akkasii ture.
I think that's about it.	Waa'ee isaa kanuma natti fakkaata.
I know it's very long.	Baayyee dheeraa akka ta'e nan beeka.
That cannot be the case with a wife.	Haadha manaa wajjin garuu akkas taʼuu hin dandaʼu.
I didn't think about you	Waa'ee kee hin yaadne
It’s not clear exactly why he did that	Maaliif akkas godhe sirriitti ifa miti
We were drinking.	Dhugaa turre.
It does a lot of things well.	Waan baay'ee akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I was the best one.	Ani isa gaarii ture.
What did he do? 	Maal godhe?
'nothing'.	'homaa'.
I didn't think of him often	Yeroo baay'ee isa hin yaadu ture
I mean, I'm not sure.	jechuu kooti.
I didn’t think he had said anything like that before	Kanaan dura waan akkasii dubbate natti hin fakkaatu ture
Those are good ones.	Isaan sun gaarii dha.
This could be his life.	Kun jireenya isaa ta’uu danda’a.
One thing though.	Waan tokko garuu.
Again, it wasn’t just a picture.	Ammas suuraa qofa hin turre.
I have a lot of money	Maallaqa baay'een qaba
Three times to be exact.	Yeroo sadii sirriitti yoo dubbanne.
It was for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf ture
I’m a good guy now.	Ani amma gurbaa gaarii dha.
I never have enough	Yoomiyyuu gahaa hin qabu
Maybe you know something, maybe you don't.	Tarii waan tokko beekta, tarii hin beektu ta'a.
Of course, she can tell you just where that is.	Sun eessa akka jiru qofa sitti himuu akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
In his eyes.	Ija isaa keessatti.
I had no idea it would be so much more	Hamma kana caalaa akka ta'u yaada hin qabu ture
This is very.	Kun baayyee...
I can tell you this much	Hamma kana sitti himuu nan danda'a
I don't think he knows anything.	Waan beeku natti hin fakkaatu.
I really can't believe my eyes	Dhuguma ija koo amanuu hin danda'u
I’m just here to help you	Si gargaaruuf qofa as jira
I'm sure he does.	Akka inni godhu mirkanaa'adha.
You can be one of us.	Ati nu keessaa tokko ta'uu dandeessa.
But it never happened.	Garuu gonkumaa hin taane.
But there is more here.	Garuu asitti kana caalaa jira.
I don't think it will ever happen	Yoomiyyuu ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadu
I'm glad he's back.	Deebi'uu isaatti gammadeera.
I think maybe it is	Tarii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
Sounds good, you might think.	Sagalee gaarii dha, jettanii yaaddu ta'a.
It went well.	Gaarii ta'ee darbe.
It was a dress.	Uffata ture.
I have no feeling for it	Miira tokkollee itti hin qabu
You don’t need me telling you what to do all the time.	Yeroo hunda maal akka gootu sitti himuu koo si hin barbaachisu.
Some of the truth in that, you know.	Sana keessaa dhugaa tokko tokko, beekta.
It can go a lot of ways.	Karaa baay'ee deemuu danda'a.
An easy one really.	Kan salphaa dhuguma.
When she’s here.	Yeroo isheen as jirtu.
Everything about him seemed to be right on.	Wanti waa'ee isaa hundi sirriitti waan irra jiru fakkaata ture.
He certainly did.	Akka godhe beekamaadha.
I didn’t quite know what to say	Waan jedhu sirriitti hin beeku ture
Only older kids.	Ijoollee umuriin isaanii guddaa ta'e qofa.
So we went on the road.	Kanaaf karaa irra deemne.
But this was no accident.	Garuu kun balaa hin turre.
All of it.	Hundi isaa.
This was a bit different.	Kun xiqqoo adda ture.
I'm trying to help.	Gargaaruuf yaalaa jira.
This is not our job.	Kun hojii keenya miti.
I think we did that today.	Har'a akkas goone natti fakkaata.
I love these kids.	Ijoollee kana nan jaalladha.
Someone like you and me	Nama akka koo fi kee
Things didn’t go right anymore.	Kana booda wanti sirriitti hin deemne.
I think of him all the time	Yeroo hundumaa isa nan yaada
Anymore.	Kana caalaa.
I can make him go away	Akka inni deemu gochuu nan danda'a
It wouldn't have been easy.	Silaa salphaa hin ta'u ture.
Why did you do it.	Maaliif goote.
I just didn’t say anything	Ani homaa hin dubbanne qofa
He seemed disinterested.	Inni waan fedhii hin qabne fakkaata ture.
I'm going to go too.	Anis deemaa jira.
There was no reason he should.	Sababni akkas gochuu qabu hin turre.
I think this sounds great	Kun waan guddaa fakkaata jedheen yaada
I can't do anything else	Waan biraa gochuu hin danda'u
Like it never happened.	Akkuma gonkumaa hin taane.
I love you, I want to be with you	Si jaalladha, si waliin ta'uu barbaada
I didn’t want to go with someone who knew me that well.	Nama akkasitti na beeku waliin deemuu hin barbaanne.
I still have that book with me	Kitaaba sana ammallee of biraa qaba
I always thought it was me.	Yeroo hundumaa ana jedheen yaada ture.
Stay tuned for us.	Nu eegaa.
I know this about me	Waa'ee koo kana nan beeka
Like tomorrow would have been nice	Akka boru silaa gaarii ture
I know you can do this	Kana gochuu akka dandeessu nan beeka
I know one of them well	Isaan keessaa tokko akka gaariitti beeka
I didn’t want to leave anyone behind.	Nama tokkollee dhiisuu hin barbaanne.
We just talked about it only.	Waa'ee isaa qofa dubbanne qofa.
You know none of us think about it.	Nu keessaa tokkollee akka itti hin yaadne beekta.
I think it's going to happen.	Ta'uuf jira jedheen yaada.
They are absolutely right.	Isaan guutummaatti sirrii dha.
Didn't do a very good job	Hojii baayyee gaarii hin hojjenne
Just a little more than nothing.	Homaa hin taane caalaa xiqqoo qofa.
I think he enjoyed it	Itti gammade natti fakkaata
He was extremely happy.	Garmalee gammade.
See here, here and here.	Asitti, as fi as ilaalaa.
I really can't believe they are mine	Dhuguma kan koo ta'uu isaanii amanuu hin danda'u
But you did your best.	Ati garuu waan dandeessu hunda goote.
Hats are a good idea, always.	Kophee yaada gaarii dha, yeroo hunda.
This is an important issue.	Kun dhimma barbaachisaa dha.
I can't do that to her	Ani akkas ishee gochuu hin danda'u
I can't really say more about that	Dhuguma waa'ee sanaa kana caalaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
Not for long.	Yeroo dheeraa miti.
I can't see anything through it.	Homaa keessaa arguu hin danda'u.
It’s not something new.	Waan haaraa miti.
They have nothing, no food.	Homaa hin qaban, nyaata hin qaban.
I am fully aware of that	Sana guutummaatti beeka
I just didn’t know how to do it	Akkamitti akka godhu qofa hin beeku ture
She had many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qabdi turte.
I could just eat you	Si nyaachuu qofa nan danda'a ture
I thought you were someone else	Ati nama biraa natti fakkaate
I want to know what happened	Waan ta'e beekuu barbaada
I already had a promise	Waadaa duraan qaba ture
It seemed easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa fakkaata ture.
She was always extremely good to me.	Yeroo hundumaa garmalee naaf gaarii turte.
That’s really nice, but probably not helpful.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola, garuu tarii hin gargaaru.
I told him it wasn’t a joke.	Qoosaa akka hin taane itti hime.
Which is pretty good.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e.
If so, how?.	Yoo akkas ta'e akkamitti?.
You became so much more	Ati baay'ee kan biraa taate
I think it's someone else	Nama biraa natti fakkaata
He didn’t want anyone to know	Namni tokkollee akka beeku hin barbaanne
I think the timing is pretty good	Yeroon isaa baayyee gaarii natti fakkaata
It may still be possible here.	Ammas asitti ni danda'ama ta'a.
He may be working tonight	Halkan kana hojjechaa jiraachuu danda'a
I think it was for that reason	Sababa kanaaf ture jedheen yaada
It could have been.	Silaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
With names and everything.	Maqaa fi waan hundumaa waliin.
I thought nothing would help.	Wanti na gargaaru hin jiru jedheen yaade.
I'm really sorry.	Dhuguma dhiifama.
I didn’t know how to tell my parents	Akkamitti akkan warra kootti himu hin beeku ture
It would have been easier on him	Silaa isa irratti salphaa ta'a ture
I want him to love me.	Akka inni na jaallatu nan barbaada.
Mine was enough	Kan koo gahaa ture
No one told me anything about them.	Namni waa'ee isaanii homaa natti hime hin turre.
Nothing else is out there.	Wanti biraa ala hin jiru.
There always seemed to be someone else around.	Yeroo hundumaa namni biraa naannoo sana jiru fakkaata ture.
On the way home.	Karaa gara manaatti.
She certainly didn’t know what she was doing.	Waan hojjechaa turte akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
I don't understand it completely	Guutummaatti naaf hin galle
You do nothing about this.	Kana irratti homaa hin gootu.
This was an old problem.	Kun rakkoo durii ture.
All he can ask for is .	Wanti inni gaafachuu danda'u .
Your good ideas.	Yaada gaarii keessan.
I will never say it again.	Kana booda gonkumaa hin jedhu.
I didn't realize any of that would happen	Sana keessaa tokkollee akka ta'u hin hubanne
He may not have a chance tomorrow	Boru carraa argachuu dhiisuu danda'a
But this time you didn’t even need eyes.	Garuu yeroo kana ija illee hin barbaachifne.
Just his opinion.	Yaada isaa qofa.
He didn't do one.	Tokko hin goone.
Anyone else have this problem?.	Namni biraa rakkoo kana qabu jiraa?.
He is with us.	Inni nu waliin jira.
I love how it turned out.	Akkamitti akka ta'e baay'een jaalladha.
That really did not look too good.	Sun dhuguma baayʼee gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
Two works better on one.	Lama tokko irratti caalaatti hojjeta.
She didn’t speak to me.	Isheen natti hin dubbanne.
I know you will do your best	Waan dandeessu hunda akka gootu nan beeka
Maybe that was bad enough.	Tarii sun hamaa gahaa ture ta'a.
I really wasn't too sure about it	Dhuguma waa'ee kanaa baay'ee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
One, you can see it.	Tokko, arguu dandeessa.
I never should have known if you hadn't spoken up	Osoo ati hin dubbanne ta'ee gonkumaa beekuu hin qabu ture
He knew that, but he didn’t know how.	Sana beeka, garuu akkamitti akka beeku hin beeku.
I wonder why that is, now.	Maaliif akkas ta'e jedheen yaada, amma.
What you have to do for me.	Waan ati naaf gochuu qabdu.
I think about this a lot.	Waa'ee kanaa baay'een yaada.
I know you want to see them.	Isaan arguu akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
The one of all time.	Kan yeroo hundumaa.
I don't know who he was at the time.	Yeroo sanatti eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku.
But that can't be right.	Garuu sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I told him what had happened	Waan ta'e itti hime
What worked for me may not work for you.	Wanti naaf hojjete siif hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
It was great.	Guddaa ture.
Maybe it's the time of year.	Tarii yeroo waggaa ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t even know that	Sana illee hin beeku ture
But mostly, of course, we were there.	Garuu irra caalaa, beekamaadha, achi turre.
That's a good question.	Gaaffii gaarii dha.
I couldn’t leave it like that	Akkasitti dhiisuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t see any problems.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin argine.
I can't do this anymore	Kana booda kana gochuu hin danda'u
I had no idea what was inside.	Waan keessa jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It looked exactly like her picture.	Suuraa ishee sirriitti fakkaata ture.
I'm not going there again.	Ammas achi hin deemu.
He has to tell her everything she doesn’t already know	Waan isheen duraan hin beekne hunda itti himuu qaba
It’s not that big of a deal.	Waan hangas guddaa miti.
I hope this is clear enough.	Kun ifa gahaa akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
But no one knew exactly what it was.	Garuu maal akka ta'e namni sirriitti beeku hin turre.
They are my opinions.	Isaan yaada kooti.
He started again.	Ammas jalqabe.
I very much doubt he cares about him at all	Inni tasumaa akka isaaf yaadu baay'een shakka
He was a very good guy to do.	Gurbaa baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjechuuf ture.
I can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
Then nothing more.	Sana booda kana caalaa homaa hin jiru.
I can't believe what he said in it	Waan inni keessa dubbate amanuu hin danda'u
I think that’s great	Sun waan guddaa natti fakkaata
I thought it was bad.	Hamaa natti fakkaate.
I think you two already know each other	Isin lamaan duruu wal beektu jedheen yaada
One is obvious.	Tokko ifaadha.
Of course, we can.	Akka dandeenyu beekamaadha.
Moments later, he was gone	Yeroo muraasa booda, inni hin jiru ture
I don’t think that’s true	Sun dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu
A bit about that.	Waa'ee sanaa xiqqoo.
I know what you need	Waan si barbaachisu nan beeka
I want to go along with it	Itti waliin deemuu barbaada
I can't believe it's true	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa amanuu hin danda'u
I don’t know how she did it, but she did.	Akkamitti akka goote hin beeku, garuu goote.
I think it’s just a joke	Qoosaa qofa natti fakkaata
You can have my money.	Maallaqa koo qabaachuu dandeessa.
See how it goes.	Akkamitti akka deemu ilaalaa.
He is in his room.	Kutaa isaa keessa jira.
So we went for it.	Kanaaf deemne.
I hope it works out well	Akka gaariitti akka hojjetu abdiin qaba
I told him almost everything	Waan hundumaa itti hime jechuun ni danda'ama
That was easy.	Sun salphaa ture.
There was nothing she could do for him.	Waan isheen isaaf gochuu dandeessu hin turre.
He knows what you look like.	Maal akka fakkaattu ni beeka.
He should have known this was going to happen	Kun ta'uuf akka jiru beekuu qaba ture
That wasn’t always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre.
He knew the place well	Bakka sana sirriitti beeka ture
He should be back soon	Dafee deebi'uu qaba
I'm going to say.	jedheen jedha.
Not by himself.	Ofii isaatiin miti.
I just can't go back	Duubatti deebi'uu qofa hin danda'u
That’s not how it works for me.	Akkasitti naaf hin hojjetu.
This cannot be right.	Kun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
They have no names.	Maqaa hin qaban.
He could have found us if he wanted to.	Osoo barbaade nu argachuu danda'a ture.
He looked at it again.	Ammas ilaale.
I thought of my parents.	Warra kootti yaade.
None of them are necessary.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee barbaachisaa miti.
In some cases.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti.
I think he knows the guy	Gurbaa sana waan beeku natti fakkaata
They needed food.	Nyaata isaan barbaachisa ture.
Someone who took it from her mother	Nama haadha ishee irraa fudhate
I like to give a little time	Yeroo xiqqoo kennuu nan jaalladha
I looked around wildly	Ani akka malee naannoo koo ilaale
I didn’t know any of it	Isa keessaa tokkollee hin beekne
It could be very bad, it could be good.	Baayyee hamaa ta'uu danda'a, gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
I knew this was too good to be true	Kun baayyee gaarii akka ta'e nan beeka ture
Living in the past.	Kan darbe keessa jiraachuu.
I hadn't thought about that.	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne ture.
No one knows this.	Kana namni beeku hin jiru.
I was very pleased with this issue.	Dhimma kanaan baay'een gammade.
I know what it’s like	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka
I still have you for tonight	Halkan kanaaf ammallee si qaba
They were in the light.	Isaan ifa keessa turan.
He did the sound, he did everything.	Sagalee hojjete, waan hunda hojjete.
Then you will know about it.	Sana booda waa'ee isaa ni beekta.
This will be a dangerous time.	Yeroon kun yeroo balaa ta'a.
It’s like living there again.	Ammas achi jiraachuu fakkaata.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
In this year.	Bara kana keessatti.
To be exact.	Sirrii ta'uuf.
It just doesn’t do it for me.	Naaf qofa hin godhu.
You can do that from here.	Sana as irraa gochuu dandeessa.
I should not have this happening in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti waan kana ta'aa jiru qabaachuu hin qabu
I think she needs her time	Yeroo ishee ishee barbaachisa jedheen yaada
I can't stay here any longer	Kana booda as turuu hin danda'u
I never said that.	Ani akkas jedhee hin beeku.
Domestic problems.	Rakkoo mana keessaa.
It could have been a lot of things though.	Silaa waan baay'ee ta'uu danda'a ture garuu.
I knew what happened there	Waan achitti ta'e nan beeka ture
Look at what happened.	Waan ta'e ilaalaa.
It’s always been a bit like that	Yeroo hundumaa xiqqoo akkas ture
That’s for good reason.	Sun sababa gaarii qaba.
Why was this happening? 	Kun maaliif ta'aa ture?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
No luck so far.	Hanga ammaatti carraa hin qabu.
Shouldn’t you have one?.	Tokko qabaachuu hin qabduu?.
You can’t go to them.	Gara isaanii deemuu hin dandeessu.
It’s not doing anything good.	Waan gaarii hojjechuu miti.
I know who took her	Eenyu akka ishee fudhate nan beeka
You were interested.	Fedhii qabda turte.
I think that's pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii natti fakkaata.
I didn't know any of this	Waa'ee kanaa tokkollee hin beeku ture
This is not yet clear.	Kun hanga ammaatti ifa miti.
Someone is watching.	Namni tokko ilaalaa jiru.
But that's what happened.	Garuu kan ta'e kanuma.
I just couldn’t help myself.	Of gargaaruu qofa hin dandeenye.
What if it's.	Maal yoo ta'e.
It’s not my money.	Maallaqa koo miti.
We’re not the only ones.	Nuti qofa mitii.
They can be what you like.	Isaan waan ati jaallattu ta'uu danda'u.
I am with my father.	Abbaa koo waliin jira.
They are still around.	Ammallee naannoo sana jiru.
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
But not that day.	Garuu guyyaa sana miti.
I was thinking that.	Ani akkas jedheen yaada ture.
He's not right for you.	Inni siif hin ta'u.
I can't go back there	Achitti deebi'uu hin danda'u
He is right on many, many issues.	Dhimma hedduu hedduu irratti sirrii dha.
I don’t understand why someone would do this to her	Namni tokko maaliif akkas akka ishee godhu naaf hin galle
But this night was different.	Halkan kun garuu adda ture.
If necessary.	Yoo barbaachisaa ta'e.
He had a chance in that.	Sana keessatti carraa qaba ture.
She was right there in the car.	Konkolaataa sana keessa sirriitti achi turte.
She really should just go now.	Dhuguma amma qofa deemuu qabdi.
He shouldn’t have done that	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture
It's not a problem now but it will be in time.	Amma rakkoo miti garuu yeroon ta'a.
But this is never, ever true.	Garuu kun gonkumaa, yoomiyyuu dhugaa miti.
I couldn’t do that to him	Ani akkas isa gochuu hin dandeenye
I knew he knew better.	Kana caalaa akka beeku nan beeka ture.
It was something I saw that day.	Waan guyyaa sana arge ture.
I'm too dangerous to stay here.	Ani baay'ee balaa qaba as turuuf.
I know you don’t think so	Akkas akka sitti hin yaadne nan beeka
But she was there.	Garuu achi turte.
I thought that was very wrong.	Sun baayyee dogoggora natti fakkaate.
But it didn’t happen that way.	Garuu akkasitti hin taane.
I wanted to be with them	Isaan waliin ta'uu barbaade
Good and bad.	Gaarii fi hamaa.
I told him this wasn’t some comic book	Kun kitaaba qoosaa tokko tokko akka hin taane itti hime
I mean really.	Dhuguma jechuu kooti.
I couldn’t go any further	Kana caalaa deemuu hin dandeenye
I hope yours is as good as mine	Kan keessan akkuma koo gaarii akka ta'u abdiin qaba
I don’t know any of this.	Waan kana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku.
But she’s nice.	Garuu isheen namatti tola.
Wrong, you are wrong.	Dogoggora, ati dogoggora.
It should be, but it's not.	Ta'uu qaba, garuu hin ta'u.
That doesn’t mean he’s happy with us.	Kana jechuun garuu nutti gammadeera jechuu miti.
As in this case.	Akkuma haala kanaa.
It’s not like anything else.	Akka waan biraa miti.
He wasn’t really in the mood for it	Dhuguma miira isaa keessa hin turre
! 	!
I don't want you	Ani si hin barbaadu
Not so with this book.	Kitaaba kanaan akkas miti.
But it does more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa ni hojjeta.
He wasn't sure what to do	Maal akka godhu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I was older than them	Ani isaan caalaa umuriin koo ture
I couldn't believe this was happening again	Kun ammas ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
No one else cares.	Namni biraa dhimma hin qabu.
She was such a bad girl	Intala hamaa akkasii ture
I need you to do this	Kana akka gootu na barbaachisa
Things like.	Waan akka.
I haven’t seen her here, yet	Asitti ishee hin argine, hanga ammaatti
You’re not just a mom, you’re not just a wife.	Ati haadha qofa miti, haadha manaa qofa miti.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
I used to teach that	Duraan sana barsiisaa ture
Clothes, shoes, now I mean that	Uffata, kophee, amma kana jechuu kooti
But that’s wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora.
I knew I would never see him again.	Kana booda akka isa hin argine nan beeka ture.
I know her better now	Amma caalaatti ishee beeka
But I have to admit it	Ani garuu amanuu qaba
I couldn’t believe he took it	Inni fudhate jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
But that doesn’t matter	Garuu sun homaa hin qabu
I don't have to go back now.	Amma duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
I want to know all that	Sana hunda beekuu barbaada
It looked like a lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee fakkaata ture.
Look at our father.	Abbaa keenya ilaalaa.
I love you so much more than you know	Kan ati beektu caalaa baay'een si jaalladha
This wasn’t just an idea.	Kun yaada qofa hin turre.
I hope you do that.	Akkas akka gootu abdiin qaba.
I hoped it was more than that.	Kana caalaa akka ta'e abdiin qaba ture.
But this is really incorrect.	Garuu kun dhuguma sirrii miti.
There is nothing more we can do.	Kana caalaa wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
I thought the same thing	Anis kanuma jedheen yaade
Then he will know.	Sana booda ni beeka.
I’m here to help you	Si gargaaruuf as jira
I think you should give this, for us, a chance	Kana, nuuf, carraa kennuu qabdu jedheen yaada
I hope this helps you	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba
That’s the problem with doing things.	Waan hojjechuu irratti rakkoon jiru kanuma.
That’s how it is.	Akkasitti jira.
I couldn't even cry.	Iyyuu hin dandeenye.
He shouldn't have done it.	Silaa gochuu hin qabu ture.
That’s just fine.	Sun gaarii qofa.
Just a lot of noise.	Sagalee baay'ee qofa.
This was a great job.	Kun hojii guddaa ture.
I really do not know why that is	Dhuguma maaliif akkas akka taʼe hin beeku
But this has not happened so far.	Kun garuu hanga ammaatti hin taane.
It's not something that happened.	Waan ta'e miti.
I'm not exactly sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku.
I really wanted to see you just today	Har'a qofa si arguu baay'een barbaade
They want to stay.	Isaan turuu barbaadu.
I know you now, boy	Amma si beeka gurbaa
I thought it would be a problem after a while	Yeroo muraasa booda rakkoo ta'a jedheen yaade
I am extremely nice.	Ani garmalee namatti tola.
We were all emotional.	Hundi keenya miira keessa turre.
I want you bad, but it wouldn't be right	Hamaa si barbaada, garuu sirrii hin ta'u ture
I wasn't sure about it	Waa'ee kanaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
You may not be my teacher.	Barsiisaa koo ta'uu dhiisuu dandeessa.
If it were true, I would be very happy	Osoo dhugaa ta'ee, baay'een gammade
I looked at what he had done	Waan inni hojjete ilaale
I know it’s not easy	Salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
No one is about.	Namni waa'ee hin jiru.
I just couldn’t do it at the time	Yeroo sanatti gochuu qofa hin dandeenye
Nothing mattered.	Wanti barbaachisaa hin turre.
He had parents.	Warra qaba ture.
A lot is on the way	Baay'een karaa irra jira
I couldn’t answer him	Deebii isaaf kennuu hin dandeenye
I can't stay long now.	Amma yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda'u.
They just didn’t want it.	Isaan qofa hin barbaanne.
But I don't know why	Maaliif akka ta'e garuu hin beeku
I knew this was coming	Kun akka dhufu nan beeka ture
That's good.	Sun gaarii dha.
Currently,.	Yeroo ammaatti,.
They had to find me first.	Dura na argachuu qabu turan.
She hadn’t done anything.	Homaa hin goone turte.
I never thought this could happen	Kun ta'uu danda'a jedhee gonkumaa hin yaadu ture
I knew all about not being myself	Waa'ee ofii koo ta'uu dhiisuu hunda nan beeka ture
No one wants to be around them.	Namni naannoo isaanii jiraachuu barbaadu hin jiru.
That's what happened.	Kanuma ta'e.
You never know.	Ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
It was indeed.	Dhuguma ture.
We have a job.	Hojii qabna.
He was once a man.	Yeroo tokko nama ture.
You’re doing something.	Waan tokko hojjechaa jirta.
I know what he was trying to do	Waan yaalaa ture nan beeka
He was working too hard at it	Garmalee itti hojjechaa ture
Your whole life.	Jireenya kee guutuu.
You can ask yourself.	Of gaafachuu dandeessa.
But you guys.	Garuu isin.
Does anyone know if that still exists?.	Sun ammallee jiraachuu isaa namni beeku jiraa?.
This was not an easy matter.	Kun dhimma salphaa hin turre.
He needs sleep.	Hirriba isa barbaachisa.
A great deal in itself	Ofii isaatiin waan guddaa
This has never been a problem.	Kun rakkoo ta'ee hin beeku.
We were together, but we weren’t.	Waliin turre, garuu hin turre.
You could be just like me in a couple of years.	Waggaa lama lama booda akkuma koo ta'uu dandeessa turte.
This seemed to be the answer.	Kun deebii waan ta’e fakkaata ture.
Maybe she’s right.	Tarii isheen sirrii dha.
It really wasn’t enough, I mean it wasn’t enough	Dhuguma gahaa hin turre, gahaa hin turre jechuu kooti
She had it coming.	Isheen akka dhufu qabdi turte.
That was right.	Sun sirrii ture.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
That wasn’t such a bad idea.	Sun yaada hamaa akkasii hin turre.
It is absolutely correct.	Guutummaatti sirrii dha.
It’s just his luck.	Carraa isaa qofa.
It really has to see someone	Dhuguma nama arguu qaba
I love this picture.	Suuraa kana baay'een jaalladha.
If it weren't for her.	Osoo isheen hin taane.
Again, this is my opinion.	Ammas yaada koo kana.
People love it so much.	Namoonni baay'ee jaallatu.
It may be different for you.	Siif adda ta'uu danda'a.
But she has it.	Garuu qabdi.
That's how it happens.	Akkasitti ta'a.
Everywhere and everyone.	Bakka hunda fi nama hunda.
But it’s not in her.	Garuu ishee keessa hin jiru.
I can't be what he wants	Ani waan inni barbaadu ta'uu hin danda'u
Just like my mother.	Akkuma haadha kooti.
You didn’t know it was there.	Achi akka jiru hin beektu turte.
I wanted to see his eyes	Ija isaa arguu barbaade
But only there.	Garuu achi qofa.
He didn’t want his hand	Harka isaa hin barbaanne
None of them interested in me.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee naaf fedhii hin qabne.
This one would work.	Inni kun ni hojjeta ture.
But it is not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti.
Perhaps he is right	Tarii sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa
I thought it was so much more than that	Kana caalaa waan baay'ee natti fakkaate
We have everything we need inside us.	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda keessa keenya qabna.
I couldn’t speak the whole way.	Karaa guutuu dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
I can't live with you.	Si bira jiraachuu hin danda'u.
I didn’t want to see anyone right now	Yeroo ammaa kana nama arguu hin barbaanne
Nobody in here understood	Namni as keessa jiru hin hubanne
I loved getting new clothes	Uffata haaraa argachuu nan jaalladha ture
I couldn’t find him.	Isa argachuu hin dandeenye.
Funny, nothing more	Qoosaa, kana caalaa homaa miti
I can't help it, really	Ani gargaaruu hin danda'u, dhuguma
I would never do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin godhu.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
One other day.	Guyyaa biraa tokko.
He stayed with them for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan bira ture
He seems to be interested.	Fedhii kan qabu fakkaata.
So I didn’t know the answer	Kanaaf deebii hin beeku ture
This wasn't going to happen.	Kun ta'uuf hin turre.
It went very quickly	Baayyee dafee deeme
He did not like to be idle.	Hojii malee taʼuu hin jaallatu ture.
You have to have it.	Ati qabaachuu qabda.
But that can't be right.	Garuu sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u.
Not even for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf illee hin jiru.
Everyone wants something.	Namni hundi waan tokko barbaada.
I wondered where the problem was.	Rakkoon sun eessa jira jedheen yaade.
I hadn’t really thought of it that way	Dhuguma akkasitti hin yaadne ture
I hadn’t thought of that.	Ani sana hin yaadne ture.
I'm happy for you.	Siif gammadeera.
I didn’t even want to	Ani iyyuu hin barbaanne
It was as simple as that	Akkuma sanaa salphaa ture
I can't say it really worked though	Dhuguma hojjete jechuu hin danda'u garuu
We saw it two or three months later.	Ji'a lama sadii booda argine.
I didn’t know what else we could have done	Silaa waan biraa gochuu dandeenyu hin beeku ture
He is willing to forgive	Dhiifama gochuuf fedhii qaba
I can't leave her alone	Kophaa ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u
I knew she was special	Isheen adda akka taate nan beeka ture
No one ever made any money.	Namni maallaqa tokkollee argate hin beeku.
I think it's just about what you can say	Waa'ee waan ati jechuu dandeessu qofa natti fakkaata
I didn’t want to tell him that.	Ani akkas itti himuu hin barbaanne.
It could be something.	Waan tokko ta'uu danda'a.
Making big money big money.	Maallaqa guddaa maallaqa guddaa argachuu.
I thought we had a lot to play for first.	Dura waan baay'ee taphachuu qabna jedheen yaade.
Maybe it's a mistake.	Tarii dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
He's them.	Inni isaan.
He wasn’t here yet.	Inni hanga ammaatti as hin turre.
I didn’t want to go anymore	Kana booda deemuu hin barbaanne
I thought this was a great idea.	Kun yaada guddaa natti fakkaate.
He didn’t, and he won’t do it again.	Inni hin goone, ammas hin godhu.
We have food outside.	Nyaata ala qabna.
They just hadn’t done it up to that point.	Hanga sanatti qofa hin hojjenne turan.
I couldn't believe all this was happening	Kun hundi ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
I want it to work for us	Akka nuuf hojjetu nan barbaada
Just one chance.	Carraa tokko qofa.
I didn’t know what to think.	Maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture.
I want to know about this happening	Waa'ee ta'aa jiru kana beekuu barbaada
I wouldn't be here if I didn't know what I wanted.	Ani osoon waanan barbaadu hin beekne as hin ta'u ture.
It was her mother's.	Kan haadha ishee turte.
It always seemed that way.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas fakkaata ture.
And then again.	Sana booda ammas.
Sorry about another night.	Waa'ee halkan biraa dhiifama.
I didn't think about it.	Ani itti hin yaadne.
It seemed so easy.	Baay'ee salphaa fakkaata ture.
Just like with me.	Akkuma na waliin.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
He knows everything that has happened and will happen.	Waan ta'ee fi ta'u hunda ni beeka.
Not just people older than me.	Namoota na caalaa umuriin isaanii guddaa ta'e qofa miti.
It was always right, right	Yeroo hundumaa sirrii, sirrii ture
It didn't work.	Hin hojjenne.
We were on there together.	Waliin achi irra turre.
I thought we had it in us.	Nu keessa qabna jedheen yaade.
But not all of them are valid.	Garuu hundi isaanii kan sirrii miti.
I mean, he’s a really good guy	Dhuguma gurbaa gaarii dha jechuu kooti
I'm going to do it.	Ani hojjechuuf deema.
But things are new.	Garuu wanti haaraa dha.
I just like being bad sometimes, that's all	Yeroo tokko tokko hamaa ta'uu qofa natti tola, kana qofa
She made it look easy.	Salphaa akka fakkaatu goote.
They were like, like, watching us.	Isaan akka, akka, nu ilaalaa turan.
He shouldn't have answered	Silaa deebii kennuu hin qabu ture
Just what we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu qofa.
This was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ture.
I thought it was a good name for us	Maqaa gaarii nuuf ta'e natti fakkaate
I love the guy, but I love him.	Gurbaa nan jaalladha, garuu ni jaalladha.
It sounded like a voice.	Sagalee fakkaata ture.
I think about all that	Sana hunda nan yaada
I don’t think there was any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee waan ture natti hin fakkaatu.
I was obviously very wrong	Baay'ee dogoggora akkan ture ifaadha
They were men before you.	Isaan si dura namoota turan.
More than anything, he wanted answers	Waan hundumaa caalaa deebii barbaada ture
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
It wasn’t true.	Dhugaa hin turre.
There was a lot she didn't know about this time.	Waa'ee yeroo kanaa waan baay'ee isheen hin beekne ture.
We won't do it now.	Amma hin goonu.
I know about everything	Waa'ee waan hundumaa nan beeka
They have no one but me.	Ana malee nama biraa hin qaban.
He was there that day	Guyyaa sana achi ture
I like it very much	Baayyee natti tola
But apparently that wasn’t the case.	Garuu akkas hin turre fakkaata.
I think it's true, but maybe sometimes it's not	Dhugaa natti fakkaata, tarii garuu yeroo tokko tokko akkas hin taane ta'a
There is a time.	Yeroon tokko jira.
I am on you, he said.	Ani isin irra jira jedhe.
Should I ask this much?.	Hanga kana gaafachuu qabaa?.
I'm not at home.	Ani mana hin jiru.
I really don’t understand his point	Dhuguma yaada isaa naaf hin galle
I haven’t even met her	Ishee waliin illee wal hin argine
I’ve never been in it	Ani keessa turee hin beeku
A lot of things can go wrong	Waan baay'een dogoggora ta'uu danda'a
They may ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu dandaʼu.
Maybe it was never about us.	Tarii waa'ee keenya ta'ee hin beeku ta'a.
I have a past, we all do	Ani waan darbe qaba, hundi keenya ni qabna
I can be a good husband to you.	Ani siif abbaa manaa gaarii ta'uu nan danda'a.
There is no such thing out here.	Asitti ala akkasii hin jiru.
After all this, I have to admit something	Kana hunda booda waan tokko amanuu qaba
It was that simple.	Akkas salphaa ture.
He interviewed me.	Gaaffii fi deebii naaf godhe.
This is not a mistake.	Kun dogoggora miti.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
But, you can’t get anything out of anything.	Garuu, waan tokko keessaa homaa argachuu hin dandeessu.
I think this definitely helps	Kun akka gargaaru beekamaadha jedheen yaada
There is no mistake.	Dogoggora hin qabu.
That would be great.	Sun guddaa ta'a.
It’s not what you think.	Waan ati yaaddu miti.
I don’t just mean his eyes	Ija isaa qofa jechuu koo miti
That's not much.	Sun baay'ee miti.
I wish we could, but we can’t	Osoo dandeenyu natti tola, garuu hin dandeenyu
I mean, nothing happened.	Homaa hin taane jechuu kooti.
No one had it.	Namni tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Not that he was fully human, exactly.	Inni guutummaatti nama ture jechuu miti, sirriitti.
I was waiting for this day	Guyyaa kana eegaa ture
In this he was right.	Kana keessatti inni sirrii ture.
I wonder what else happened	Kan biraa maaltu ta'e jedheen yaada
This time things seem to be different for me.	Yeroo kana wanti adda naaf ta'u fakkaata.
It’s not home yet.	Ammallee mana hin taane.
I do that with everybody	Nama hunda waliin akkas nan godha
Then it’s no big deal.	Sana booda waan guddaa miti.
I had no idea what had happened	Waan ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I thought that was good	Sun gaarii natti fakkaate
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
Sometimes it could be good	Yeroo tokko tokko gaarii taʼuu dandaʼa ture
We don’t need to say that at all.	Tasumaa akkas jechuun nu hin barbaachisu.
I hope you don’t have any of them	Isaan keessaa tokkollee akka hin qabne abdiin qaba
I mean, they really know all about them	Dhuguma waa'ee isaanii hunda beeku jechuu kooti
I thought of some pretty good names.	Maqaa baay'ee gaarii tokko tokko yaade.
I don't know much.	Waan baay'ee hin beeku.
Everything that had to come from life was theirs	Jireenya irraa wanti dhufuu qabu hundi kan isaanii ture
That didn’t work.	Sun hin hojjenne.
Not everyone is like you.	Namni hundi akka kee miti.
This is exactly what they were doing.	Kun sirriitti waan isaan hojjechaa turan.
I wouldn’t have had to do anything	Silaa homaa gochuun na hin barbaachisu ture
I think it’s myself	Ofii kooti jedheen yaada
Self and father.	Ofii fi abbaa.
But I like it here	Asitti garuu natti tola
You never know.	Ati gonkumaa hin beektu.
But wait, something just occurred to me.	Garuu eegaa, wanti tokko amma natti dhufe.
Who knows, but that seems like a lot.	Eenyu beeka, garuu sun waan baay'ee fakkaata.
I love this man very much	Nama kana baay'een jaalladha
Something that takes time.	Waan yeroo barbaadu.
But it wasn’t his.	Garuu kan isaa hin turre.
I think people are optimistic.	Namoonni abdii guddaa qabu jedheen yaada.
I love when this happens.	Yeroo kun ta'u nan jaalladha.
Or a girl?.	Moo intala?.
We have opportunities and opportunities.	Carraa fi carraa qabna.
These two would go so well together.	Kun lamaan akkasitti waliin deemu turan.
There is nothing we can do for these people.	Namoota kanaaf wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
Everything you want.	Waan barbaaddu hunda.
That wasn’t it.	Kana hin turre.
I know what's going on inside him.	Keessa isaa maaltu akka ta'aa jiru nan beeka.
I know the year.	Waggaa nan beeka.
She needs to know.	Isheen beekuu qabdi.
Hers, perhaps.	Kan ishee tarii.
From the girl.	Intala irraa.
Then they might be.	Sana booda taʼuu dandaʼu.
See what more is in it.	Kana caalaa maaltu akka keessa jiru ilaalaa.
It should have been funny, but it wasn't.	Silaa qoosaa ta'uu qaba ture, garuu hin turre.
I mean, she only had me	Ana qofa qabdi turte jechuu kooti
It looked like she had a few tonight.	Halkan kana muraasa waan qabdu fakkaata ture.
No one said anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf namni homaa hin dubbanne.
This was a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii ture.
Maybe I'm not saying it right	Tarii sirriitti jechuu dhiisuu danda'a
It still wouldn't happen.	Ammas hin ta'u ture.
It works well together	Akka gaariitti waliin hojjeta
She was the mother of three children	Haadha ijoollee sadii turte
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
I can't even see the car from here	Konkolaataa illee as irraa arguu hin danda'u
He should have said that	Silaa akkas jechuu qaba ture
There is nothing there for you.	Achitti wanti siif ta'u hin jiru.
I just have this feeling.	Miira kana qofa qaba.
I wasn't sure any of it was true anymore	Kana booda keessaa tokkollee dhugaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
It should have been home	Silaa mana ta'uu qaba ture
But I wanted to go with him	Ani garuu isa waliin deemuun barbaade
We have plenty of time.	Yeroo baay'ee qabna.
I didn't think much of it	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne
Maybe it doesn't.	Tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
I know exactly what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeka
But maybe it should be.	Garuu tarii ta'uu qaba.
I could give you one	Tokko siif kennuu nan danda'a ture
Not after what happened.	Waan ta'ee booda miti.
Which isn’t a bad thing.	Kan waan hamaa hin taane.
So unsure in herself.	Kanaaf ofii ishee keessatti mirkanaa’aa miti.
I know where we were	Bakka turre nan beeka
I don't know when that will happen.	Sun yoom akka ta'u hin beeku.
I certainly do.	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha.
We need to do this.	Kana gochuu qabna.
I never want to see you again	Amma booda gonkumaa si arguu hin barbaadu
But I need your help	Gargaarsa keessan garuu barbaada
I hope that will be long	Sun dheeraa akka ta'u abdiin qaba
We did a good job.	Waan gaarii hojjenne.
I didn’t know what else to do	Kan biraa maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I think you’ll really like it	Dhuguma ni jaallattu jedheen yaada
Today is different.	Har'a adda.
But that’s not right.	Garuu sun sirrii miti.
But no one else did.	Garuu namni biraa hin goone.
That worked well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjete.
I thought this would be a good time	Yeroon kun yeroo gaarii ta'a jedheen yaade
I didn't tell him anything.	Ani homaa itti hin himne.
So that’s my answer.	Kanaaf deebii koo kanuma.
I am new to it too.	Anis irratti haaraa dha.
I didn’t speak to anyone during the day.	Guyyaa nama tokkollee hin dubbanne.
I had no idea this was going to happen	Kun ta'uuf akka jiru yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
There is no problem.	Rakkoon hin jiru.
You have that right.	Ati sirrii sana qabda.
I had no idea where I was going	Eessa akkan deemu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
That 's all	Kana qofa .
You are doing well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechaa jirta.
I started to get the picture	Suuraa sana argachuu jalqabe
We need to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabna.
I couldn't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin dandeenye.
I was someone else and not even me, but a different guy	Ani nama biraa malee ana illee osoo hin taane, gurbaa adda ta'e
I hadn’t worked on it	Ani irratti hin hojjenne ture
Something about him is not quite right.	Waa'ee isaa wanti guutummaatti sirrii hin taane jira.
It doesn't have to be long.	Dheeraa ta'uu hin qabu.
I thought it was too long.	Garmalee dheeraa natti fakkaate.
You still don’t need it	Ammallee si hin barbaachisu
I don’t belong here	Ani kan as miti
I love this job so much.	Hojii kana baay'een jaalladha.
I thought he might be right	Sirrii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaade
I don't know exactly what's going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru sirriitti hin beeku.
He was just a guy.	Inni gurbaa qofa ture.
I love to go.	Deemuun baay'ee natti tola.
He did this to both of us.	Kana lamaan keenya irratti godhe.
I am not clear	Ani ifa hin taane
He said you are going to do this.	Kana gochuuf jirta jedhe.
This is just one of many.	Kun hedduu keessaa tokko qofa.
I just thought we got along	Walii galle qofa natti fakkaate
I want to tell them we made a mistake	Dogoggora hojjenne itti himuu barbaada
Just couldn’t get enough	Qofa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye
I hesitated in the doorway	Balbala keessaa duubatti jedheen
I didn’t want to know	Ani beekuu hin barbaanne
Easy, he thought.	Salphaa jedhee yaade.
I don't know how this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu hin beeku.
I don’t want answers but questions	Gaaffii malee deebii hin barbaadu
He seemed to be there to help.	Gargaaruuf waan jiru fakkaata ture.
It was another matter.	Dhimma biraa ture.
Everything was wrong with me.	Wanti hundi natti dogoggora ture.
He was only there when he was alone	Yeroo inni kophaa jiru qofa achi ture
If not, that it's bad.	Yoo hin taane, akka inni hamaa ta'e.
I knew what this was	Kun maal akka ta'e nan beeka ture
This time we had someone do it.	Yeroo kana nama tokko akka godhu qabna turre.
I think you know what that means now	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e amma waan beektu natti fakkaata
If you don’t have them, you should buy them.	Yoo isaan hin qabne ta’e bitachuu qabda.
I couldn’t find any errors	Dogoggora tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye
I thought they would be	Ni ta'u jedheen yaade
He gave a life.	Jireenya tokko kenne.
In some cases it can be very serious.	Haala tokko tokko keessatti baay’ee hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
But it didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraaf garuu hin turre.
I still don't know how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e ammallee hin beeku.
They were good people.	Namoota gaarii turan.
I want to know.	Ani beekuu barbaada.
I can't say how or when	Akkamitti fi yoom jechuu hin danda'u
I can see it in his clothes	Uffata isaatiin arguu nan danda'a
I didn't realize it would happen	Akka ta'u hin hubanne
She wouldn’t go away.	Isheen hin deemtu turte.
Not this guy.	Gurbaa kana miti.
He didn’t want to come with me.	Na waliin dhufuu hin barbaanne.
I can do it later	Booda gochuu nan danda'a
I know a lot of people.	Namoota baay'een beeka.
I was working up here	Ani as ol hojjechaa ture
It seemed to have worked.	Hojjete fakkaata ture.
It is not complete without Him	Isa malee guutuu miti
I have nothing in common with her anymore.	Kana booda waan ishee waliin wal fakkaatu hin qabu.
That's just different.	Sun waan adda ta'e qofa.
I can't seem to find what's going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru argachuu waanan hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
I didn’t realize it then	Yeroo sana hin hubanne ture
I am very happy with this car	Konkolaataa kanaan baay'een gammadeera
I don't know.	Ani hin beeku.
I want it all to work	Hundi isaa akka hojjetu nan barbaada
He should have known long ago	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura beekuu qaba ture
He couldn't help anyone.	Nama gargaaruu hin danda'u ture.
I wanted her to hold my hand again	Ammas akka harka koo qabdu barbaade
He had many good opportunities.	Carraa gaarii hedduu qaba ture.
That’s not always true.	Sun yeroo hundumaa dhugaa miti.
It’s just there.	Achi qofa jira.
I could do that all day	Guyyaa guutuu akkas gochuu nan dandaʼa ture
He was right.	Inni sirrii ture.
We were together for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf waliin turre.
It just has to play the New Year’s Eve situation	Haala bara haaraa taphachuu qofa qaba
I may have some here	Asitti tokko tokko qabaachuu danda'a
It’s better this way.	Haala kanaan wayya.
I could have done something.	Silaa waan tokko gochuu nan danda'a ture.
Nothing seemed to help.	Wanti gargaaru hin fakkaatu ture.
He seems to know him better than himself.	Inni ofii isaa caalaa waan isa beektu fakkaata.
Me, him and her and his wife.	Ana, isaa fi ishee fi haadha manaa isaa.
I obviously don’t mean that	Akkas jechuu akkan hin barbaanne ifaadha
Maybe they should have.	Tarii qabaachuu qabu ta'a.
It was going to be a long night.	Halkan dheeraa ta'uuf ture.
But in this case he was right.	Garuu haala kana keessatti inni sirrii ture.
We are there.	Ni jirra.
This is the moment.	Yeroon kun yeroo sana.
I don't want much	Waan baay'ee hin barbaadu
That wouldn’t help.	Sun hin gargaaru ture.
One with her.	Tokko ishee waliin.
I wasn’t enough for him	Ani isaaf gahaa hin turre
They were very good.	Baayyee gaarii turan.
But I wasn't doing that	Ani garuu akkas gochaa hin turre
I’ve known him for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf isa beeka
She wouldn't have thought much of it.	Silaa baay'ee hin yaaddu ture.
I want you to go to your room	Kutaa kee akka deemtu nan barbaada
More than a chance to be a mere thinker.	Carraa nama yaada qofa ta'uu caalaa.
Neither of us can speak.	Lamaan keenyayyuu dubbachuu hin dandeenyu.
I just didn’t want to be in that position.	Bakka sana jiraachuu qofa hin barbaanne.
People are human.	Namoonni nama.
Didn't do it to be bad	Hamaa ta'uuf hin goone
They just have a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa deemuu qofa qabu.
I had no idea he was coming here	Akka inni as dhufu yaada hin qabu ture
But he wouldn't say it.	Garuu hin jedhu ture.
That may be appropriate.	Sun sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I really didn’t know	Dhuguma hin beeku ture
You didn’t do anything.	Ati homaa hin goone.
He is with us now.	Amma nu bira jira.
I didn't know what enlightenment meant	Ifa jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku ture
Glad to see him.	Isa arguu kootti gammadeera.
I never said it would be easy	Salphaa ta'a jedhee hin beeku
He was very good at his job.	Hojii isaa irratti baayyee gaarii ture.
He is looking for us.	Nu barbaadaa jira.
But he knew that couldn’t be the case.	Garuu akkas ta’uu akka hin dandeenye beeka ture.
It always works for me.	Yeroo hunda naaf hojjeta.
You become your true thoughts.	Ati yaada dhugaa kee ta'a.
All day, every day.	Guyyaa guutuu, guyyaa hunda.
I then looked around the bar	Anis sana booda naannoo mana dhugaatii sanaa ilaale
I wanted her, he thought	Ani ishee barbaada jedhee yaade
But it will be good	Garuu gaarii ta'a
I think that seems right	Sun sirrii fakkaata jedheen yaada
You are truly unique.	Dhuguma adda taate.
But that didn’t last long.	Garuu sun yeroo dheeraaf hin turre.
I know that exactly	Sana sirriitti beeka
We didn’t have it then.	Yeroo sanatti hin qabnu turre.
I think about you all day long	Guyyaa guutuu waa'ee kee nan yaada
You didn’t say anything.	Ati homaa hin dubbanne.
It was a highlight of the day.	Guyyaa sanatti waan guddaa ture.
Just doing the best he can.	Waan danda'u hunda gochuu qofa.
So it wasn’t good	Kanaaf gaarii hin turre
I love that about him	Waa'ee isaa sana nan jaalladha
I don't understand this answer.	Deebii kana naaf hin galle.
Again, just my opinion.	Ammas yaada koo qofa.
I wish this wasn’t the case	Kun osoo hin taane natti tola ture
I was going tomorrow	Boru deemaa ture
Right before eating.	Nyaata nyaachuu dura sirriitti.
We’ve been doing this for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf kana gochaa turre.
Going there soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti achi deemaa jira.
It’s not going to	Deemu miti
You can be yourself.	Of ta'uu dandeessa.
He had two issues.	Dhimma lama qaba ture.
So now they’re going to do something similar.	Kanaaf amma waan wal fakkaatu hojjechuuf jiru.
She didn’t know what she wanted to say to someone.	Namatti maal jechuu akka barbaaddu hin beektu turte.
I can't help those people	Namoota sana gargaaruu hin danda'u
It’s not a bad thing.	Waan hamaa miti.
I couldn’t do anything else	Waan biraa gochuu hin dandeenye
Let us know how we can help you.	Akkamitti akka si gargaaruu dandeenyu nuuf himi.
But not exactly.	Garuu sirriitti miti.
I thought about it again some more	Ammas hamma tokko itti yaade
He knows a lot of things	Waan baay'ee beeka
He knew that well enough	Sana sirriitti beeka ture
But we need more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa nu barbaachisa.
But it seemed more appropriate as she walked away	Garuu yeroo isheen deemtu caalaatti sirrii fakkaata ture
I need her in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti ishee na barbaachisa
But I never knew it	Ani garuu gonkumaa hin beeku ture
That’s how it happened.	Akkasitti ta’e.
I really want to go home	Ani baay'een gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaada
It’s not easy.	Salphaa miti.
This happened all the time.	Kun yeroo hunda ni ta'a ture.
I mean, it was like work, work, work	Akka hojii, hojii, hojii ture jechuu kooti
It was that good.	Akkasitti gaarii ture.
He shouldn't even be on there.	Inni achi irra illee ta'uu hin qabu.
I did not have much time.	Yeroo baayʼee hin qabu ture.
Something just happened.	Waan tokko amma ta'e.
He was here, but now he was gone.	Inni as ture, amma garuu hin turre.
This doesn’t work for me.	Kun naaf hin hojjetu.
I just can't quit	Ani qofa dhiisuu hin danda'u
I don’t want it completely anymore	Kana booda guutummaatti hin barbaadu
Things like that.	Wantoota akkasii.
You are going to be a very good mother.	Haadha baayyee gaarii ta'uuf jirta.
They look very human.	Baay'ee nama fakkaatu.
He should know right now	Yeroo ammaa kana beekuu qaba
Nothing without her.	Ishee malee homaa miti.
I'm just a little bit interested though	Ani garuu xiqqoo qofa fedhii qaba
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Not true, of course.	Dhugaa miti, beekamaadha.
Something had to give.	Waan tokko kennuu qaba ture.
This isn’t you.	Kun ati miti.
You can .	Ni dandeessa .
I didn’t know what he meant.	Maal jechuu akka barbaade hin beeku ture.
The same sound.	Sagalee wal fakkaatu.
That was a long time ago.	Sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Now he can go home.	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu danda'a.
I didn’t know him, but he knew something	Ani isa hin beekne, garuu inni waan beeku ture
Everyone knew everyone else’s issues.	Namni hundi dhimma nama hundumaa beeka ture.
I need a new place to go	Bakka haaraa itti deemu na barbaachisa
It has something everyone wants.	Waan namni hundi barbaadu qaba.
I wasn’t there either.	Anis hin jiru ture.
I don’t know any better.	Kana caalaa hin beeku.
He wouldn’t go to bars.	Mana dhugaatii hin deemu ture.
He didn’t even have a home.	Mana illee hin qabu ture.
One thing we all need to do.	Waan tokko hundi keenya gochuu qabna.
Can't make that work.	Sana akka hojjetu gochuu hin danda'u.
That’s the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kanuma.
I was never your father	Ani abbaa kee ta'ee hin beeku
That’s how it went.	Akkasitti deeme.
I like it very much	Baayyee natti tola
More about me.	Waa'ee koo caalaatti.
So I went to make one.	Kanaaf tokko hojjechuuf deeme.
I think it could have been something else	Silaa waan biraa ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada
It’s not just bad.	Hamaa qofa miti.
We always have hope.	Yeroo hundumaa abdii qabna.
A lot of people make that mistake	Namoonni baay'een dogoggora sana hojjetu
Now it's just me.	Amma ana qofa.
It wasn’t true at the time.	Yeroo sanatti dhugaa hin turre.
It wasn’t like anywhere else to go.	Akka bakka biraa itti deemu hin turre.
I couldn't be alone with her now	Amma kophaa koo ishee waliin ta'uu hin dandeenye
Perhaps this is not necessary.	Tarii kun barbaachisaa miti.
That was in the past.	Sun kan darbe ture.
With a very good one.	Kan baayyee gaarii ta'e waliin.
This night is for us.	Halkan kun nuuf ta'a.
I know it’s not that easy	Akkas salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka
It was a mistake, but I can't go back in this situation.	Dogoggora ture, garuu haala kana keessatti duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
I couldn’t really do anything.	Dhuguma waan tokko gochuu hin dandeenye.
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
She is certainly much more dangerous than she seems.	Isheen isheen fakkaattu caalaa baayyee balaa akka qabdu beekamaadha.
He was in enough trouble.	Rakkoo gahaa keessa ture.
This can go big.	Kun guddaa deemuu danda'a.
We didn’t want other people in our lives	Jireenya keenya keessatti namoota biraa hin barbaanne
I know she wants me to do that	Isheen akkas akkan godhu barbaaddu nan beeka
This is where you need to be.	Bakka ta'uu qabdu kana.
But a long time ago.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa dura.
Not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti.
I will be right here.	Ani sirriitti asitti nan ta'a.
They are very nice people.	Namoota baayyee gaarii dha.
Just my opinion.	Yaada koo qofa.
It’s really really good.	Dhuguma dhuguma gaarii dha.
I don't have a problem now.	Amma rakkoo hin qabu.
Completely, completely different.	Guutummaatti, guutummaatti adda.
I'm still not sure about that.	Ani hanga ammaatti waa'ee sanaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
But that didn’t matter.	Garuu sun homaa hin turre.
I think I'm waiting for someone	Nama waanan eegaa jiru natti fakkaata
I do know you a little better	Ani garuu xiqqoo caalaa si beeka
I always knew you loved me	Yeroo hundumaa akka ati na jaallattu nan beeka ture
I like that a lot	Sun baayyee natti tola
I don’t know what to do with it	Maal akkan itti godhu hin beeku
That’s how I would do it	Ani akkasitti nan godha ture
Sometimes it can be a lonely affair.	Yeroo tokko tokko dhimma kophaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I was looking for something.	Waan tokko barbaadaa ture.
It was her light and that would be yours.	Ifa ishee ture sun kan kee ta'a ture.
We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past.	Dogoggora darbe irra deebi’uu hin dandeenyu.
But I am very clear	Ani garuu baay'ee ifaadha
How can they know? 	Akkamitti beekuu dandaʼu?
Of this, more later.	Kana keessaa, caalaatti booda.
One of his classes.	Kutaa isaa keessaa tokko.
I think it has a date	Guyyaa qaba jedheen yaada
He couldn’t live without me for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ana malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
I didn't really care for the teacher	Barsiisaa kanaaf baay'ee dhimma hin qabu ture
But we knew nothing.	Nuti garuu homaa hin beekne.
We are not your problem.	Nuti rakkoo keessan miti.
Most probably.	Irra caalaa hin oolu.
I didn’t do that.	Ani akkas hin goone.
Nothing could have been further from the truth.	Silaa dhugaa irraa kana caalaa wanti ta’uu danda’u hin jiru.
I often wonder what he is up to now	Yeroo baayyee amma maal irra jira jedheen yaada
They’re just ideas.	Isaan yaada qofa.
I always knew this	Yeroo hundumaa kana nan beeka ture
He knows what to do.	Waan godhu ni beeka.
I was very excited about this work	Hojii kanaaf baay'een gammade
One look and you’ll know.	Tokko ilaalaa ni beekta.
I can't tell him what to do	Waan godhu itti himuu hin danda'u
I don’t need them anymore.	Kana booda isaan hin barbaachisu.
You know he does.	Akka inni godhu beekta.
I thought about my mother	Waa'ee haadha koo jedheen yaade
That you don’t need the food.	Nyaata sana akka si hin barbaachifne.
I could live with this	Kana waliin jiraachuu nan danda'a ture
She didn’t see any of it.	Isheen tokkollee hin argine.
I didn't want that and we both agreed	Ani akkas hin barbaadu ture lamaan keenya iyyuu irratti walii galle
I didn’t do what was going on with me	Waan na waliin deemaa jiru hin goone
Very good so far.	Hanga ammaatti baayyee gaarii dha.
I don't know if you know this.	Kana beekuu keessan hin beeku.
Which happened.	Kan ta'e.
It’s still dangerous.	Ammallee balaa qaba.
I can still have a mother	Ammas haadha qabaachuu nan danda'a
I know, it’s still a bit early.	Ani beeka, ammallee xiqqoo dafee jira.
If he wants to ask you.	Yoo si gaafachuu barbaade.
I told him that wasn’t true	Anis sun dhugaa akka hin taane itti hime
We are working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa jirra.
So he didn’t feel bad about it.	Kanaaf miira hamaa itti hin taane.
We need these things.	Wantoota kana nu barbaachisa.
Nothing happens here.	Asitti wanti ta'u hin jiru.
Man has problems in his life	Namni jireenya isaa keessatti rakkoo qaba
Like if it's.	Akka yoo ta'e.
It was so much better not to know.	Beekuu osoo hin taane akkasitti wayya ture.
A year later my mother	Waggaa tokko booda haadha koo
You don’t have yourself.	Ati of hin qabdu.
You know your age.	Ati umuriin kee ni beekta.
A little goes a long way	Xiqqoo karaa dheeraa deema
Not why, but just how.	Maaliif osoo hin taane akkamitti qofa.
It was going to be our day.	Guyyaa keenya ta'uuf ture.
There were few such people at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namoonni akkasii muraasa turan.
I hope someone can help me with this.	Kana irratti namni tokko akka na gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I still couldn’t see anything	Ammallee homaa arguu hin dandeenye
I didn't know anything was wrong	Waan dogoggora ta'e tokkollee hin beeku ture
But none of that mattered.	Garuu sun tokkollee dhimma hin qabu ture.
I'm pretty good at this	Kana irratti baay'een ga'umsa qaba
It works very well for me.	Baayyee gaarii naaf hojjeta.
Look at what he does.	Waan inni hojjetu ilaalaa.
They are all very human.	Hundi isaanii baay'ee nama.
But they could have.	Garuu qabaachuu danda'u turan.
We still have to be teachers.	Ammas barsiisaa ta'uu qabna.
This one is.	Inni kun.
It took me about three hours.	Gara sa'aatii sadii natti fudhate.
It seems to be.	Waan fakkaata.
I have a couple of issues with this.	Kana irratti dhimma tokko lama qaba.
Eating at me.	Natti nyaachuu.
She didn’t even know her own name.	Maqaa ofii illee hin beektu turte.
This is not your book.	Kun kitaaba keessan miti.
It’s just something that exists.	Waan jiru qofa.
I wasn’t interested in any of that	Sana keessaa tokkollee fedhii hin qabu ture
You don't know us.	Ati nu hin beektu.
I really couldn’t believe it.	Dhuguma amanuu hin dandeenye.
I suggest you do that	Ani akkas akka gootu yaada kooti
He wouldn’t have done that at the time	Yeroo sanatti akkas hin godhu ture
It seemed like a long way.	Karaa dheeraa fakkaata ture.
Another time, another year .	Yeroo biraa, waggaa biraa .
Everything becomes clear.	Wanti hundi ifa ta'a.
I was lucky in my career	Hojii koo keessatti carraa guddaa qaba ture
They have two children together	Waliin ijoollee lama qabu
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
This was my real issue.	Kun dhimma koo isa dhugaa ture.
But, wait in the way.	Garuu, karaa keessa eegaa.
See what happens.	Waan ta'u ilaalaa.
I can't believe he got this	Kana argate jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I wondered exactly who he was	Ani sirriitti eenyu akka ta'e yaade
I doubt going there would be helpful	Achi deemuun gargaarsa akka qabu nan shakka
That’s how we should have it.	Akkasitti qabaachuu qabna.
We couldn't really see much outside	Dhuguma ala waan baay'ee arguu hin dandeenye
I knew that one drink was a bad idea	Dhugaatii tokko yaada hamaa akka taʼe nan beeka ture
Very much.	Baayyee.
Not much of an idea.	Yaada baay'ee miti.
There is nothing more.	Kana caalaa wanti jiru hin jiru.
It has enough problems	Rakkoo gahaa qaba
Then he has questions for us.	Sana booda gaaffii nuuf qaba.
Obviously, this works both ways.	Kun karaa lamaan akka hojjetu beekamaadha.
It really could only have been one of two people.	Dhuguma namoota lama keessaa tokko qofa ta'uu danda'a ture.
It was just in my room	Kutaa koo keessa qofa ture
I didn't think he could see me completely	Guutummaatti na arguu waan danda'u natti hin fakkaatu ture
That was not the case with this book.	Kitaaba kanaan garuu akkas hin turre.
I wasn’t that girl anymore	Kana booda ani intala sana hin turre
We weren't supposed to be like that.	Nuti akkas ta'uu hin qabnu turre.
They do not	Isaan hin .
That’s really nothing.	Sun dhuguma homaa miti.
I am just one person.	Ani nama tokko qofa.
You can never know.	Gonkumaa beekuu hin dandeessu.
What happens, happens.	Wanti ta'u, ni ta'a.
It is an important one.	Kan barbaachisaa dha.
That time was now.	Yeroon sun amma ture.
But this wasn’t to be.	Garuu kun ta’uu hin qabu ture.
I know you know this	Kana akka beektu nan beeka
He should still have it	Ammas qabaachuu qaba
You can’t see me now.	Amma na arguu hin dandeessu.
This was a good while ago.	Kun yeroo gaarii dura ture.
I think it must have been a month ago	Ji'a tokko dura ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada
I can't leave you two alone together, ever	Lamaan keessan kophaa keessan waliin dhiisuu hin danda'u, yoomiyyuu
It was so, but it wasn’t perfect.	Akkas ture, garuu guutuu hin turre.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
It was around three in the morning.	Ganama naannoo sa'aatii sadii ture.
I knew it was really none of my business	Dhuguma dhimma koo akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I knew my mother.	Haadha koo nan beeka ture.
Today he is on everything.	Har'a waan hunda irra jira.
I had no idea what to say.	Waan jedhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I could see fine without them.	Isaan malee gaarii arguu nan danda'a ture.
I never know how to speak in these things	Wantoota kana keessatti dubbachuu gonkumaa hin beeku
He says a couple can work for me.	Lamaan lama naaf hojjechuu danda'a jedha.
We didn’t even talk.	Nuti illee hin dubbanne.
You have a lot of work to do.	Hojii baay'ee qabda.
They have no real idea what happened.	Waan ta'e yaada dhugaa hin qaban.
We were together.	Waliin turre.
I still don't understand	Ammallee naaf hin galle
I used to love that so much	Duraan akkas baay'een jaalladha ture
I didn’t know how to do that	Akkamitti akkas godhu hin beeku ture
Nothing happened.	Wanti ta'e hin jiru.
It seems a little bit.	Xiqqoo fakkaata.
He didn't say much.	Baay'ee hin dubbanne.
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
I will do that.	Ani akkas nan godha.
I didn't do much of that at the time	Yeroo sanatti sana keessaa baay'ee hin hojjenne
The timing never seemed right.	Yeroon sun gonkumaa sirrii hin fakkaatu ture.
It wouldn’t really exist.	Silaa dhuguma hin jiru ture.
I am sure it will happen.	Akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa dha.
Someone has to see them.	Namni tokko isaan arguu qaba.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
I mean, until.	Hanga jechuu kooti.
I think it sounds great.	Sagalee guddaa natti fakkaata.
It doesn't seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu.
I'll do it right	Sirrii nan godha
We can’t do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
No need, really.	Hin barbaachisu, dhuguma.
Not a good idea.	Yaada gaarii miti.
Not sure how this works, exactly.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu mirkanaa'aa miti, sirriitti.
It's not about them.	Waa'ee isaanii miti.
They have their time.	Yeroo isaanii qabu.
This was not without reason.	Kun sababa malee hin turre.
I think we have something here	Asitti waan tokko qabna jedheen yaada
That’s always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa kanuma.
I can never do it.	Yoomiyyuu hin danda'u.
I told him it was a mistake.	Dogoggora akka ta'e itti hime.
It’s not working anymore.	Kana booda hojjechaa hin jiru.
I wasn’t a good person	Ani nama gaarii hin turre
Hope this helps you out.	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdii qabna.
Getting a feel for it.	Miira isaa argachuu.
This is not going to be easy to say.	Kun jechuun salphaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
I can be a different person	Nama adda ta'uu nan danda'a
But that may take some doing.	Garuu sun tokko tokko gochuu gaafachuu dandaʼa.
I just want you for tonight	Halkan kanaaf qofa si barbaada
You should already know this.	Kana duruu beekuu qabdu.
Perhaps they are friends.	Tarii hiriyyoota taʼuu dandaʼu.
It wouldn't have happened	Silaa hin ta'u ture
I can't go.	Deemu hin danda'u.
I thought that would be very nice of him	Sun baay'ee isa tola jedheen yaade
He didn't have much to tell	Waan baay'ee himu hin qabu ture
Things that probably shouldn't be.	Wantoota tarii ta'uu hin qabne.
I have two questions about that	Waa'ee sanaa gaaffii lama qaba
I know what that means	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e nan beeka
She certainly didn’t know she was watching.	Isheen akka ilaalaa jirtu akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
I want to ask for help	Gargaarsa gaafachuu barbaada
He told me they had a chance.	Carraa akka qaban natti hime.
Most people know this.	Namoonni baay'een kana ni beeku.
But she didn't see it.	Isheen garuu hin argine.
We have the same idea.	Nuti yaada wal fakkaatu qabna.
It’s just a great thing.	Waan guddaa qofa.
I know exactly what's going on	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeka
I am really getting lonely	Dhuguma kophaa koo ta'aa jira
I can't sleep anymore	Kana booda hirriba hin danda'u
I thought at that moment	Yeroo sanatti jedheen yaade
She didn't speak.	Isheen hin dubbanne.
He knew that well enough.	Sana sirriitti beeka ture.
I was expecting that	Sana eegaa ture
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
I never, ever wanted that car	Konkolaataa sana gonkumaa, gonkumaa hin barbaanne
I’m glad he came	Inni dhufuu isaatti gammadeera
I was just there with my kids.	Ijoollee koo waliin qofa achi ture.
On its own, that wasn’t enough.	Ofii isaatiin sun gahaa hin turre.
He's never been like that.	Inni akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
I mean, it wasn’t like him	Akka isaa hin turre jechuu kooti
I have no idea what’s in here	Waan as keessa jiru yaada hin qabu
No one knew where she was now.	Amma eessa akka jirtu namni beeku hin turre.
I always knew the truth	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa jiru nan beeka ture
It shouldn't have been like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
Most of the time, it doesn't.	Yeroo baay'ee, hin ta'u.
He had not done this.	Kana hin goone ture.
When he was waiting.	Yeroo inni eegaa ture.
It really looks like forgiveness.	Dhuguma dhiifama fakkaata.
I don’t know, we’ll just have to see.	Hin beeku, arguu qofa qabna.
This one is going to be a bit more.	Inni kun xiqqoo caalaa ta'uuf deema.
You can go back there	Achitti deebi'uu dandeessa
It was so obvious.	Akkas ifa ture.
This is not to say that it is not dangerous.	Kun balaa hin qabu jechuu miti.
I thought it was your opinion	Yaada keessan jedheen natti fakkaate
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
He did exactly what he had to do	Waan gochuu qabu sirriitti hojjete
I know this has to happen	Kun ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka
I could work with him	Isa wajjin hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture
But she was none of those things.	Isheen garuu wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin turre.
I'm not good enough.	Ani gaarii miti.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I know you did this for me	Kana akka naaf goote nan beeka
But that was a very long time ago.	Garuu sun yeroo baayyee dheeraa dura ture.
Right now it’s just not there yet.	Yeroo ammaa kana ammallee hin jiru qofa.
I should have been the one to go	Silaa kan deemu ana ta'uu qaba ture
Whatever it was about them, it was none of my business.	Waa'ee isaanii maal iyyuu yoo ta'e, dhimma koo tokkollee hin turre.
I know that's still a lot	Sun ammallee baay'ee akka ta'e nan beeka
I need to go over them with you tonight	Halkan kana si waliin isaan irra deemuun na barbaachisa
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
I’m here for the long haul	Ani as jira yeroo dheeraaf
I don’t want to know that time.	Yeroo sana beekuu hin barbaadu.
The problem is nothing.	Rakkoon homaa hin qabu.
I knew it wasn’t	Akka hin taane nan beeka ture
He is still doing this.	Ammas kana hojjechaa jira.
But I will say this	Ani garuu kana nan jedha
I think it’s a matter of when, not if	Dhimma yoom malee yoo miti jedheen yaada
I have no other questions	Gaaffii biraa hin qabu
He looks nice.	Inni namatti tola fakkaata.
He certainly doesn’t belong there entirely alone.	Inni guutummaatti kophaa isaa kan achi akka hin taane beekamaadha.
We don’t need it here.	Asitti nu hin barbaachisu.
Have.	Qaba.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
It was a whole day before her.	Guyyaa guutuu ishee dura ture.
I didn’t think about any of those things	Wantoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin yaadne
I can't do anything with him	Isa waliin homaa gochuu hin danda'u
I wanted to know more about her	Waa'ee ishee caalaatti beekuu barbaade
One job.	Hojii tokko.
I hoped I would never know that feeling.	Miira sana gonkumaa akkan hin beekne abdiin qaba ture.
I wanted to be like him	Anis akkuma isaa taʼuu barbaade
Your time is not now.	Yeroon kee amma miti.
I love everything about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa nan jaalladha.
You really haven’t done your homework.	Dhuguma hojii manaa kee hin hojjenne.
Glad to see that now.	Amma sana arguu isaatti gammadeera.
I think you have to be fresh	Haaraa ta'uu qabda jedheen yaada
When one of them is yours.	Isaan keessaa tokko kan kee yeroo ta'u.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba ture.
I think we should leave this out	Kana keessa dhiisuu qabna jedheen yaada
If you don’t want it, you don’t want it.	Yoo hin barbaanne hin barbaanne.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
What I thought she meant	Maal jechuu ishee akkan yaade
That can't be the case.	Sun akkas ta'uu hin danda'u.
I mean, he's probably a great dad	Abbaa guddaa ta'uu hin oolu jechuu kooti
No one knew it was coming for him.	Namni isaaf dhufuu beeku hin turre.
Very long time in some cases	Yeroo baayyee dheeraa haala tokko tokko keessatti
I hoped no one noticed	Namni akka hin hubanne abdiin qaba ture
I don't mean for that to happen	Wanti akkasii akka ta'uuf jechuu koo miti
We had a simple life.	Jireenya salphaa qabna turre.
Then I can live	Sana booda jiraachuu nan danda'a
I wouldn’t say we were exactly friends	Sirriitti hiriyyoota turre hin jedhu
All she knew was here and now here and now.	Wanti isheen beektu as fi amma as fi amma qofa ture.
I can see you, you know	Si arguu nan danda'a, beekta
He was waiting for someone to go with him.	Akka nama waliin deemu eegaa ture.
I don’t know anything, I didn’t do anything	Ani homaa hin beeku, homaa hin goone
No one should know it exists.	Namni akka jiru beekuu hin qabu.
He was looking for something very specific.	Inni waan baayʼee adda taʼe barbaadaa ture.
I couldn’t believe my own eyes	Ija ofii amanuu hin dandeenye
I could do that strap.	Qabduu sana gochuu nan danda'a ture.
I really care about you	Dhuguma siif yaada
All she wanted was for someone to know.	Wanti isheen barbaaddu namni tokko akka beeku ture.
It doesn’t go away.	Hin deemu.
He thought he should say something, but he didn't know what it meant.	Waan tokko dubbachuu qaba jedhee yaade, garuu maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beekne.
You don’t need to do anything in that situation.	Haala sana keessatti homaa gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
He didn’t want anyone to know	Namni akka beeku hin barbaanne
I have to say this though	Kana jechuun qaba garuu
But there is no such thing.	Garuu wanti akkasii hin jiru.
Let me just .	Mee akkan qofa .
I think he’s looking for it	Inni barbaadaa jira jedheen yaada
Wait for a day.	Guyyaa tokko eegaa.
He said you might be right.	Sirrii ta'uu dandeessa jedhe.
I don't know of any other pictures.	Suuraa biraa hin beeku.
I didn't know all about that	Waa'ee sana hunda hin beeku ture
It was someone else's.	Kan nama biraa ture.
I like her eyes.	Ija ishee natti tola.
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I do, almost every day	Ani nan godha, guyyaa hunda jechuun ni danda’ama
Again, again, again.	Ammas, ammas, ammas.
He doesn't exist now.	Amma hin jiru.
Everything seemed easy.	Wanti hundi salphaa natti fakkaate.
I don’t think that’s true.	Sun dhugaa natti hin fakkaatu.
Then he did something.	Sana booda waan tokko godhe.
I think that was absolutely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa ture jedheen yaada.
I don't mean that.	Akkas jechuu koo miti.
Most of the time I can’t do this	Yeroo baay’ee kana gochuu hin danda’u
The timing seemed right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii fakkaata ture.
But that's not the only possible answer.	Garuu deebii ta'uu danda'u kana qofa miti.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
Better ask him.	Isa gaafachuu wayya.
But you have to give it.	Garuu kennuu qabda.
Maybe everything is wrong.	Tarii wanti hundi dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
It could be one of one.	Tokko keessaa tokko ta’uu danda’a.
I think you two have a lot in common.	Isin lamaan waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu natti fakkaata.
But then again maybe they have.	Garuu sana booda ammas tarii qaban ta'a.
I definitely would have liked to meet her	Silaa ishee waliin wal arguu akkan barbaadu beekamaadha
We just wanted to ask a couple of questions.	Gaaffii tokko lama qofa gaafachuu barbaanne.
I can't say the name of the verb	Maqaa gochaa jechuu hin danda'u
They love that.	Sana ni jaallatu.
We need all the hands we have.	Harka qabnu hunda nu barbaachisa.
He did look into the eyes.	Inni dhuguma ija keessa ilaale.
He wants more than anything.	Waan hundumaa caalaa barbaada.
I have no idea what she was doing there.	Achitti maal hojjechaa akka turte yaada hin qabu.
It should be to go with everything	Waan hundumaa waliin deemuuf ta'uu qaba
That wouldn't be good.	Sun gaarii hin ta'u ture.
But I won't tell him everything	Waan hundumaa garuu itti hin himu
I knew he hadn’t	Akka hin qabne nan beeka ture
The problem is, it doesn’t work.	Rakkoon jiru, hin hojjetu.
He was in real trouble	Rakkoo dhugaa keessa ture
You are exactly where you need to be.	Bakka ta'uu qabdu sirriitti jirta.
Until she.	Hanga isheen.
Nothing is going to happen here.	Asitti wanti ta'uuf deemu hin jiru.
They say it's good	Gaarii ta'e jedhu
He didn't even ask questions.	Gaaffii illee hin goone.
It certainly helps.	Gargaarsa akka qabu beekamaadha.
It wasn’t so much on its own.	Ofii isaatiin hangas hin turre.
He started walking towards her	Gara ishee deemuu jalqabe
So that’s not the problem.	Kanaaf rakkoon jiru kanuma miti.
This is what happens.	Wanti ta'u kana.
Perhaps you can do that.	Tarii akkas gochuu dandeessa taʼa.
I love it so much.	Ani baay'een jaalladha.
The good and the bad.	Waan gaarii fi hamaa.
I'm not good enough for you	Ani siif gaarii miti
I know that never happened with my mother.	Haadha koo waliin akkas ta'ee akka hin beekne nan beeka.
I don’t know what to make of this.	Kana maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I hadn’t seen that one before	Isa sana kanaan dura hin argine ture
It’s not doing you any good.	Gaarii siif gochaa hin jiru.
He shouldn't have come	Silaa dhufuu hin qabu ture
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
They are good people.	Isaan namoota gaarii dha.
It was certainly their way.	Karaa isaanii akka ture beekamaadha.
But then he realized.	Garuu sana booda hubate.
Therefore, we	Kanaaf, nuti .
But he should have known.	Garuu beekuu qaba ture.
Without anything else.	Waan tokko malee.
I’m still really looking for the answer	Ammallee dhuguma deebii isaa barbaadaa jira
I didn’t care at all	Ani garuu tasumaa dhimma hin qabu ture
Someone has to have it.	Namni tokko qabaachuu qaba.
I had to do my job.	Hojii koo hojjechuu qaba ture.
He wants to play bad.	Hamaa taphachuu barbaada.
But that’s not all they have in common.	Garuu kana qofa osoo hin taane waan wal fakkaatu qabu.
This was better.	Kun wayya ture.
A year ago it would have been easier	Waggaa tokko dura silaa salphaa ture
I really want that	Sana baay'een barbaada
Us and our money.	Nu fi qarshii keenya.
He has been everywhere.	Bakka hunda tureera.
I really had no sense of this	Dhuguma kanaaf miira tokkollee hin qabu ture
I could not have been more wrong.	Kana caalaa dogoggora taʼuu hin dandaʼu ture.
Which he didn’t do.	Kan inni hin hojjenne.
It just went wrong.	Dogoggora qofa deeme.
I wanted it a lot	Baay'een barbaade
If so, she was one of them.	Yoo akkas ta'e isheen isaan keessaa tokko turte.
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
But that just seems wrong.	Garuu sun dogoggora qofa fakkaata.
She still had a chance.	Ammallee carraa qabdi turte.
He wanted to know if you were home	Mana jiraachuu kee beekuu barbaade
But I couldn't tell him that	Ani garuu akkas itti himuu hin dandeenye
By now we knew he was a boy.	Yeroo ammaatti gurbaa ta'uu isaa beekne.
I knew it had to be you	Si ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture
He has to give me an answer.	Deebii naaf kennuu qaba.
I thought she wanted to be alone	Kophaa ta'uu waan barbaaddu natti fakkaate
Her old home.	Mana ishee durii.
I hope you have something good for me	Waan gaarii akka naaf qabdu abdiin qaba
I was probably two of those	Ani tarii warra sana keessaa lama taʼuu hin oolu
Three of us, three of them.	Sadii keenya, isaan keessaa sadii.
I know how this thing works	Wanti kun akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka
So far it has been easy	Hanga ammaatti salphaa ta'ee ture
It becomes a real thing.	Waan dhugaa ta'a.
No one ever wanted to live here.	Namni as jiraachuu barbaade hin beeku.
You would think this would be the easy one.	Kun isa salphaa ta'a jettanii yaaddu.
I think it’s very nice	Baayyee namatti tola jedheen yaada
I know this is absolutely true	Kun guutummaatti dhugaa ta’uu isaa nan beeka
It must be a problem.	Rakkoo ta'uu qaba.
There is no work today.	Har'a hojiin hin jiru.
I would never go for it.	Ani gonkumaa itti hin deemu ture.
That was his issue.	Sun dhimma isaa ture.
I told him the truth	Anis dhugaa itti hime
He became himself again	Ammas of ta'e
I need help with this	Kana irratti gargaarsa na barbaachisa
My new job.	Hojii koo haaraa.
A place of hope.	Bakka abdii qabu.
I still can't believe this is happening	Ammallee kun ta'aa jira jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
I was going to go, but I couldn’t make myself	Ani akkan deemu ture, garuu akkan of gochuu hin dandeenye
But you know that’s not how it works, she said.	Garuu akkasitti akka hin hojjenne beekta jette.
Then work took him up again.	Sana booda hojiin ammas ol isa fudhate.
But it had been a disaster.	Garuu balaa hamaa ta'ee ture.
Maybe it's just the timing.	Tarii yeroon qofa ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t know you would	Akka gootu hin beeku ture
Everyone knew it by now.	Yeroo ammaatti namni hundi beeka ture.
He still wants to be human.	Ammas nama ta'uu barbaada.
I can't come today.	Har'a dhufuu hin danda'u.
I can give it to you.	Siif kennuu nan danda'a.
Let me tell you.	Mee sitti himi.
It would have been just her	Silaa ishee qofa ta'a ture
I know you won’t do that again	Ammas akkas akka hin goone nan beeka
She was not being a good mother	Haadha gaarii ta'aa hin turre
I want to talk to you about that.	Waa'ee sanaa sitti dubbachuu barbaada.
We still have work to do.	Ammallee hojii qabna.
They would have told each other.	Silaa waliin himu turan.
Nothing works.	Wanti hojjetu hin jiru.
That's how we should do it.	Akkasitti gochuu qabna.
We can’t help you.	Si gargaaruu hin dandeenyu.
I can see that in my case	Sana dhimma koo keessatti arguu nan danda'a
There could be no other reason.	Sababni biraa jiraachuu hin danda’u ture.
I love working with her.	Ishee waliin hojjechuu baay'een jaalladha.
No one knew she was here.	As akka jirtu namni beeku hin turre.
I can never leave him alone.	Yoomiyyuu kophaa isaa dhiisuu hin danda'u.
I wanted to ask you about it	Waa'ee isaa isin gaafachuu barbaade
But we can't.	Garuu hin dandeenyu.
I can't do that from here.	Ani as irraa akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
It’s not a great area.	Naannoo guddaa miti.
It didn't work.	Hin hojjenne.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Waan akkasii akka jiru yaada hin qabu ture.
It’s not new.	Haaraa miti.
It was absolutely right.	Guutummaatti sirriitti ture.
I haven’t seen you in a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf si hin argine
It’s just money.	Maallaqa qofa.
I couldn't say it.	Jechuu hin dandeenye.
I just can't believe it	Ani qofa amanuu hin danda'u
You need her.	Ishee si barbaachisa.
I don’t mean a problem, it’s not like that	Rakkoo jechuu koo miti, akkas miti
I'm sure everything will be fine	Wanti hundi gaarii akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha
But it probably doesn't matter.	Garuu homaa ta'uu hin oolu.
He went to another place.	Gara biraa deeme.
Sometimes he has to give way	Yeroo tokko tokko karaa kennuu qaba
I knew nothing before that	Sana dura homaa hin beeku
Looks right, guys.	Sirrii fakkaata gurbaa.
I have a job.	Hojiin qaba.
Why, I don’t even know when.	Maaliif, yoom illee hin beeku.
Again, this was nothing new.	Ammas kun waan haaraa hin turre.
Good luck to them.	Isaan carraa gaarii.
I had no idea she could do this	Kana gochuu akka dandeessu yaada hin qabu ture
But nothing seems to happen.	Garuu wanti ta'u hin fakkaatu.
She didn't know what she was thinking.	Maal akka yaaddu hin beekne.
I love every bit of my work	Hojii koo xiqqoo hunda nan jaalladha
He's not who I told you he was.	Inni eenyu akka ta'e sitti hime miti.
All of these are there.	Kun hundi ni jiru.
I can’t go very long.	Baay’ee dheeraa deemuu hin danda’u.
Just for tonight.	Halkan kanaaf qofa.
But he wouldn't go.	Garuu hin deemu ture.
It just wasn’t his idea.	Qofa yaada isaa hin turre.
Not just sometimes, but all the time.	Yeroo tokko tokko qofa osoo hin taane, yeroo hunda.
I have no idea what that means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
I didn’t know what to do with him.	Waan isaaf godhu hin beeku ture.
That’s when he realized what he had to do.	Yeroo sanatti waan gochuu qabu hubate.
She was drinking.	Isheen dhugaa turte.
It's definitely not about you.	Waa'ee kee akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I said pretty much the same thing	Anis baayʼee kanuma jedheen ture
I shouldn’t have seen him	Silaa isa arguu hin qabu ture
I don’t intend to stay in that room.	Kutaa sana keessa turuuf hin yaadu.
But he didn’t seem to notice.	Garuu waan hin hubanne fakkaata ture.
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
I don't love you, dog.	Si hin jaalladhu saree.
But there is hope.	Garuu abdiin jira.
I wasn't sure I wanted her to know	Akka isheen beektu akkan barbaadu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I love it, but it has many problems.	Ani baay'een jaalladha, garuu rakkoo hedduu qaba.
I don’t want your clothes.	Uffata kee hin barbaadu.
They want to have money.	Maallaqa qabaachuu barbaadu.
I always wanted to help people	Yeroo hundumaa namoota gargaaruu nan barbaada ture
He was right about it	Waa'ee isaa sirrii ture
He even has a job.	Hojii illee qaba.
No answer, yet.	Deebii hin qabu, hanga ammaatti.
I am everything to you	Ani waan hundumaa siif ta'a
Just say it.	Jedhu qofa.
I couldn’t see that she didn’t care.	Isheen dhimma akka hin qabne arguu hin dandeenye.
I do hope, that it helps you	Ani abdiin qaba, akka isin gargaaru
I couldn’t see it well	Akka gaariitti arguu hin dandeenye
But no one was coming.	Garuu namni dhufu hin jiru ture.
None of them are there.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin jiru.
I think it was bad	Hamaa ture jedheen yaada
You are not yourself.	Ati ofii kee miti.
I can live with that	Sana waliin jiraachuu nan danda'a
That wasn’t the worst part.	Sun waan hunda caalaa hamaa hin turre.
I have been watching.	Ani ilaalaa tureera.
It may not be too late.	Yeroo booda ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I really don't know.	Dhuguma hin beeku.
Fewer cars, but that’s it.	Konkolaataa muraasa, garuu kanuma.
But he couldn't eat it.	Garuu nyaachuu hin dandeenye.
I’m never going to go.	Ani gonkumaa hin deemu.
He had a different teacher	Barsiisaa adda taʼe qaba ture
It’s the time of my day.	Yeroon guyyaa kooti.
I would never do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin godhu.
I think this whole thing is great.	Wanti kun hundi waan guddaa natti fakkaata.
There was a lot that seemed wrong with that.	Wanti sana irratti dogoggora fakkaatu baay'ee ture.
As.	Akka.
I have no idea what this is	Kun maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
Now we have a car.	Amma konkolaataa qabna.
I can't live with this anymore	Kana booda kanaan jiraachuu hin danda'u
I didn't see her that much last year	Bara darbe akkas baay'ee ishee hin argine
But I can’t stay much longer.	Garuu kana caalaa baay’ee turuu hin danda’u.
Now that may not be the case.	Amma garuu sun taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
There is nothing you can do about this.	Kana irratti wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
That eye.	Ija sana.
They are very similar.	Baayyee wal fakkaatu.
I think it’s his biggest danger right now	Yeroo ammaa kana balaa isaa isa guddaa natti fakkaata
Maybe he can do this.	Tarii kana gochuu danda'a.
I don't want anyone but that person.	Nama sana malee nama hin barbaadu.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
It’s really not like that.	Dhuguma akkas miti.
It was the real one.	Kan dhugaa ture.
They are all wrong.	Hundi isaanii dogoggora.
I really don’t need another one.	Dhuguma kan biraa na hin barbaachisu.
I love that girl so much	Intala sana baay'een jaalladha
So, sorry for that.	Kanaaf, kanaaf dhiifama.
I have no idea what our time means anymore	Yeroon keenya kana booda maal jechuu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
I had a lot of drinking, that's all	Dhugaatii baay'een qaba ture, kana qofa
I could never go back	Yoomiyyuu duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
That’s a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii dha.
I was so wrong about everything	Waan hundumaa irratti baay'een dogoggora ture
Many of them.	Baay'ee isaanii.
He should have been here earlier	Duraan as jiraachuu qaba ture
Maybe it was nothing.	Tarii homaa hin turre ta'a.
It was one morning.	Ganama tokko ture.
Not a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii miti.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
I want to believe in it.	Ani itti amanuu barbaada.
He wants to shout at it	Itti iyyuu barbaada
Bad day with bad stuff	Guyyaa hamaa waan hamaa waliin
I can't do that not now	Ani akkas gochuu hin danda'u amma miti
It wasn’t always like this though.	Yeroo hunda akkas hin turre garuu.
This is not an easy matter.	Kun dhimma salphaa miti.
It was quick.	Dafee ture.
I thought that said a lot.	Sun waan baay'ee dubbate jedheen yaade.
They would have all known each other by then.	Silaa yeroo sanatti hundi isaanii wal beeku turan.
It wasn't much, but it was hers.	Baay'ee hin turre, garuu kan ishee ture.
That's when I wanted to go home	Yeroo sanatti gara manaatti deebi'uu barbaade
It was all she said.	Wanti isheen jette qofa ture.
I could not have stayed much longer	Silaa kana caalaa baayʼee turuu hin dandaʼu ture
I didn't know it was the same thing	Kanuma ta'uu isaa hin beeku ture
I don't know how it happened.	Akkamitti akka ta'e hin beeku.
Good location with us	Bakka gaarii nu waliin
It's probably right.	Sirrii ta'uu hin oolu.
I can't stay here any longer	Kana booda as turuu hin danda'u
I know about that	Waaʼee kanaa nan beeka
I still can't see anything	Ammallee homaa arguu hin danda'u
I was hoping it would be soon	Yeroo dhiyootti akka ta'u abdiin qabaa ture
I have been in that house	Mana sana keessa tureera
I was only three years old at the time	Yeroo sanatti umuriin koo waggaa sadii qofa ture
I don't know about anything like that.	Waa'ee waan akkasii hin beeku.
She may have had hope a long time ago	Yeroo dheeraa dura abdii qabdi turte ta'a
He should have stayed longer	Silaa kana caalaa achi turuu qaba ture
That’s how it went.	Akkasitti deeme.
He is mine, not yours.	Inni kan kooti malee kan kee miti.
Which should be great for you.	Kan siif guddaa ta'uu qaba.
I can never go home again	Amma booda yoomiyyuu gara manaatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
He shouldn't do that.	Akkas gochuu hin qabu.
Which wasn’t a problem, per se.	Kan rakkoo hin turre, ofuma isaatiin.
So, we did it.	Kanaaf, ni goone.
It looks like you.	Si fakkaata.
But maybe not.	Tarii garuu hin ta'u ta'a.
Very similar to the facts of the present case.	Dhugaa dhimma amma jiru waliin baayyee wal fakkaatu.
Now she’s a different girl.	Amma intala adda taate.
I didn’t know anyone in there	Nama achi keessa jiru hin beeku ture
They still have to play us next year	Ammas bara dhufu nu taphachuu qabu
I don’t know what to make of them	Maal akkan isaan irraa godhu hin beeku
Maybe it would have gone further.	Tarii silaa kana caalaa deeme ta'a.
I wanted to ask you something	Waan tokko si gaafachuu barbaade
We just didn’t understand it.	Nuti garuu hin hubanne qofa.
I never understood why	Maaliif akka ta'e gonkumaa naaf hin galle
He still had no answer for it	Ammallee deebii isaaf hin qabu ture
A long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa.
Then again, maybe it wasn't.	Sana booda ammas tarii hin turre ta'a.
I wish it was but it's not	Osoo ta'ee natti tola garuu hin ta'u
I think it's a good question.	Gaaffii gaarii natti fakkaata.
Which happened.	Kan ta'e.
What if that's the case.	Maal yoo akkas ta'e.
If not, we have a problem.	Yoo hin taane rakkoo qabna.
But something different.	Garuu waan adda ta'e.
I know his name, but nothing more.	Maqaa isaa nan beeka, garuu kana caalaa homaa hin qabu.
He had a chance.	Carraa qaba ture.
I know what he’s doing	Waan inni hojjechaa jiru nan beeka
I just thought, you know .	Ani akkas jedheen yaade qofa, beekta .
She had no idea what it was except for something.	Waan tokko malee maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabdu turte.
It doesn’t work exactly like that.	Sirriitti akkasitti hin hojjetu.
Afternoon.	Waaree booda.
I want to live life with you	Jireenya si waliin jiraachuu barbaada
But he didn’t do this.	Garuu kana hin goone.
I hadn’t thought about it either	Anis itti hin yaadne ture
A lot of things can go wrong.	Wanti baay'een dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
Lots of names.	Maqaa baay'ee.
I was nothing like them	Ani homaa akka isaanii hin turre
Often you even intend to do the job well.	Yeroo baayʼee hojii sana akka gaariitti hojjechuuf illee yaada qabda.
I don’t know where I’m going	Eessa akkan deemu hin beeku
That's all I can tell you	Kana qofa sitti himuu danda'a
I can meet you	Ani wal arguu nan danda'a
That told me a lot.	Sun waan baay'ee natti hime.
I can't believe my good luck	Carraa gaarii koo amanuu hin danda'u
He is in good shape today.	Har'a haala gaarii irra jira.
Not entirely sure why it didn't work.	Maaliif akka hin hojjenne guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
She was here.	Isheen as turte.
He needs time.	Yeroo isa barbaachisa.
He wanted to stay that way for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf akkasitti turuu barbaade
I couldn’t believe we were still doing this	Ammallee kana gochaa jirra jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
I just love him so much	Ani baay'een isa jaalladha qofa
I can tell you this much	Hamma kana sitti himuu nan danda'a
But that's what happened.	Garuu kan ta'e kanuma.
Something seemed wrong.	Waan tokko dogoggora fakkaata ture.
I don't want anything.	Ani homaa hin barbaadu.
They love the facts.	Dhugaa jiru ni jaallatu.
Maybe more so now.	Tarii amma caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
So there was no time.	Kanaaf yeroon hin turre.
But it’s not just there.	Garuu achi qofa miti.
Perhaps both are true.	Tarii lamaan isaanii iyyuu dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼu.
This is happening now.	Kun amma ta'aa jira.
Bad, just bad.	Hamaa, hamaa qofa.
I want to do this.	Kana gochuun barbaada.
But this doesn't work.	Kun garuu hin hojjetu.
But I would never have told him that	Silaa garuu gonkumaa akkas itti hin himu ture
I even wondered if the past had really happened	Wanti darbe dhuguma taʼuu isaa illee nan yaade
I think about him all the time	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee isaa nan yaada
You don’t need his help.	Gargaarsa isaa hin barbaaddu.
Maybe it's us.	Tarii nuti ta'a.
I was outside with my dog.	Saree koo waliin ala ture.
That was a little nice.	Sun xiqqoo namatti tola ture.
In what we’ve done, what we’ve all done, is unforgivable.	Waan hojjenne, waan hundi keenya hojjenne, dhiifama hin qabne keessatti.
This never happened	Kun gonkumaa ta’ee hin beeku
A lot had happened during that year	Waggaa sana keessatti waan baay'een ta'ee ture
But there would be more.	Garuu kana caalaa ni jiraata ture.
I thought everyone would think of pictures	Namni hundi suuraa irratti yaada jedheen yaade
I saw him the day after he found it	Guyyaa inni argate booda isa arge
I think you should go home, now	Gara manaatti deemuu qabda jedheen yaada, amma
I don't understand such things	Waan akkasii naaf hin galle
Loud enough all by itself.	Sagalee guddaa gahaa hunda ofuma isaatiin.
That is exactly what I would have done	Silaa sirriitti kanuma nan godha ture
He is not always here	Yeroo hundumaa as hin jiru
I love my job.	Hojii koo nan jaalladha.
I wondered how he knew all this	Kana hunda akkamitti beeka jedheen yaade
This is what he told me.	Kan inni natti hime kana.
I know this person.	Nama kana nan beeka.
That’s not what happened here.	Asitti wanti akkasii hin taane.
Who are like us.	Kan akkuma keenya.
But now you have to tell me the truth.	Amma garuu dhugaa jiru natti himuu qabda.
You and your father.	Ati fi abbaa kee.
I can't see how it could be bad for you	Akkamitti siif hamaa ta'uu akka danda'u arguu hin danda'u
I didn’t know what else to say	Kana caalaa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
She’s no different.	Isheen adda miti.
Certainly not good.	Gaarii akka hin taane beekamaadha.
If it's good.	Yoo gaarii ta'e.
It’s none of these things.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee miti.
You’re looking at the whole picture.	Suuraa guutuu ilaalaa jirta.
Now this can be a problem.	Amma kun rakkoo ta'uu danda'a.
I’ve never said that to her in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti akkas jedhee isheen hin beeku
Not in this situation.	Haala kana keessa miti.
I mean, not entirely.	Guutummaatti miti jechuu kooti.
It was very simple.	Baayyee salphaa ture.
Tom didn't know what to do.	Toom maal akka godhu hin beeku ture.
This was not what he needed right now.	Kun yeroo ammaa kana waan isa barbaachisu hin turre.
I couldn’t see him, but he was there	Isa arguu hin dandeenye, garuu achi ture
More so another time.	Caalaatti yeroo biraa.
It wouldn't be right.	Silaa sirrii hin ta'u.
I can't ask for anything else	Waan biraa gaafachuu hin danda'u
He couldn't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin dandeenye.
I'll be fine though	Ani garuu gaarii ta'a
But there is another reason.	Garuu sababni biraa jira.
What he wanted.	Waan inni barbaade.
I can't speak.	Dubbachuu hin danda'u.
There is no time anymore.	Yeroon kana booda hin jiru.
I couldn’t find him	Isa argachuu hin dandeenye
While their problems can be serious.	Rakkoon isaan qaban hamaa ta'uu kan danda'u yoo ta'u.
Only a few times, she said.	Yeroo muraasa qofa jette.
It was a disaster, that should never have happened.	Balaa guddaa ture, sun gonkumaa ta'uu hin qabu ture.
He couldn’t come to me.	Gara koo dhufuu hin dandeenye.
He didn’t want to know that.	Sana beekuu hin barbaadu ture.
This was pretty simple.	Kun baayyee salphaa ture.
I know your father very well	Abbaa kee baay'een beeka
As in the everyday.	Akkuma guyyaa guyyaa keessatti.
I just looked at them together	Waliin qofa isaan ilaale
I still have it.	Ammallee qaba.
I don't know what the reason for this is	Sababni kanaa maal akka ta'e hin beeku
He can help you.	Inni si gargaaruu dandaʼa.
It wasn’t a good day.	Guyyaa gaarii hin turre.
They couldn't have been better.	Isaan kana caalaa ta'uu danda'u hin turre.
I just couldn’t tell her	Ishee qofa himuu hin dandeenye
You’re in it.	Keessa jirta.
Then and one.	Sana booda fi tokko.
I want to know about you	Waa'ee kee beekuu barbaada
I didn’t want to talk anymore	Kana booda dubbachuu hin barbaanne
He was so sure of himself.	Inni akkas ofitti mirkanaa'aa ture.
Not so much, anymore.	Hanga kana miti, kana booda.
You were like a boy.	Ati akka gurbaa turte.
She was the girl.	Intala isheen turte.
We always have such a great time.	Yeroo hundumaa yeroo guddaa akkasii qabna.
Hope this helps.	Kun akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
You people need to do something about it.	Isin namoonni waa'ee isaa waan tokko gochuu qabdu.
I have no idea who it is	Eenyu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
They are still there.	Ammallee achi jiru.
I came here yesterday	Kaleessa as dhufe
This was an obvious mistake.	Kun dogoggora ifa ta’e ture.
Something was important.	Wanti tokko barbaachisaa ture.
This probably won’t work.	Kun tarii hin hojjetu.
I’m glad I did it	Hojjechuu kootti gammadeera
I told him about my parents	Waa'ee warra koo itti hime
It's just great.	Guddaa qofa.
Everyone loves him.	Namni hundi isa jaallata.
I want it, again.	Ani barbaada, ammas.
I was waiting for him	Anis isa eegaa ture
Where, I wondered.	Eessa jedheen yaade.
He was completely right, of course.	Guutummaatti sirrii ture, beekamaadha.
I hadn’t told my mom he was coming over	Haadha kootti akka inni bira dhufu hin himne ture
I know nothing about this.	Dhimma kana homaa hin beeku.
He should have come to you	Silaa gara kee dhufuu qaba ture
Yesterday again.	Kaleessa ammas.
It was too dangerous, too dangerous.	Garmalee balaa qaba ture, garmalee balaa qaba ture.
That seems right.	Sun sirrii fakkaata.
But tonight I wasn't sure.	Garuu halkan kana mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
That he came here to help me	Akka inni na gargaaruuf as dhufe
Now I know who you are	Amma eenyu akka taate nan beeka
He is not completely human.	Guutummaatti nama miti.
I can't do that to them	Ani akkas isaan irratti gochuu hin danda'u
I knew what you wanted	Waan ati barbaaddu nan beeka ture
We can’t see it.	Arguu hin dandeenyu.
I like to make mistakes	Dogoggora hojjechuu nan jaalladha
That’s one thing.	Sun waan tokko.
Which was the case.	Kan ture.
You guys are really good.	Isin dhuguma gaarii dha.
I mean, what happened to you two	Isin lamaan maal taate jechuu kooti
It took a whole day, then a day.	Guyyaa guutuu, sana booda guyyaa tokko fudhate.
You don't do this.	Kana hin gootu.
I haven’t in a long time	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti hin qabu
But it’s not that different here.	Garuu asitti hangas adda miti.
You can't see me.	Na arguu hin dandeessu.
Now, this sounds so simple, it’s not.	Amma, kun akka malee salphaa fakkaata, akkas miti.
Always with them.	Yeroo hundumaa isaan waliin.
I haven’t had that for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf akkas hin qabu
I don’t know how that works.	Sun akkamitti akka hojjetu hin beeku.
There is a man there.	Namni achi jira.
If so, you're in luck.	Yoo akkas ta'e carraa qabda.
I didn’t know what else to say.	Kan biraa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture.
It could have been a mistake.	Dogoggora ta'uu danda'a ture.
They have a daughter together.	Intala tokko waliin qabu.
That's exactly it.	Sirriitti kanuma.
He wants sleep but it doesn’t come	Hirriba barbaada malee hin dhufu
But there is a lot of work out there.	Garuu hojiin baay'een achi keessa jira.
It's never about anyone else.	Waa'ee nama biraa gonkumaa miti.
Wrong, that wasn't even his to do	Dogoggora, sun kan isaa illee hin turre hojjechuuf
I knew it would be like that	Akkas akka ta'u nan beeka ture
I want to be very clear.	Baayyee ifa ta'uu barbaada.
So it’s dangerous.	Kanaaf balaa qaba.
He’s with a girl .	Inni intala tokko waliin jira .
Now was the chance to say something.	Amma carraan waan tokko dubbachuu ture.
But more than that, it has to be.	Garuu kana caalaa, ta'uu qaba.
I wanted to know why this was	Kun maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaade
I know you have it.	Akka ati qabdu nan beeka.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
Just tell me that.	Kana qofa natti himi.
She wasn't much of a drinker.	Isheen baay'ee dhugaatii hin turre.
It was certainly a special time.	Yeroon sun yeroo adda taʼe akka ture beekamaadha.
No one would say anything.	Namni homaa hin jedhu ture.
You can stay local.	Naannoo keessan turuu dandeessa.
But of course he wasn’t there.	Garuu beekamaadha inni achi hin turre.
I saw him in his room	Kutaa isaa keessatti isa arge
A great way to help people	Karaa guddaa namoota gargaaruuf gargaaru
I don't know much about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beeku.
That was her.	Sun ishee turte.
This year’s one.	Kan bara kanaa.
Never more than now	Amma caalaa gonkumaa hin ta'u
A little something after a long time	Waan xiqqoo yeroo dheeraa booda
Not a very good job.	Hojii baayyee gaarii miti.
One catch though.	Qabduu tokko garuu.
There was no one in there.	Achi keessa namni hin turre.
I knew there was no one else in here	As keessa namni biraa akka hin jirre nan beeka ture
I have a lot of work to do	Hojii baay'een qaba
I think he’ll do just fine	Inni akka gaariitti ni hojjeta jedheen yaada
After a week, he rarely eats.	Torban tokko booda yeroo muraasaaf nyaata.
I can't believe you didn't even tell him	Ati illee itti hin himne jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
It's still not happening.	Ammallee ta'aa hin jiru.
I think you have a go	Deemtu qabda jedheen yaada
He could have had such a great life.	Jireenya guddaa akkasii qabaachuu danda'a ture.
What they need.	Waan isaan barbaachisu.
I mean, when you think about it.	Yeroo itti yaaddu jechuu kooti.
It works for you.	Siif hojjeta.
They shouldn't have been.	Isaan ta'uu hin qaban turan.
Very good question indeed	Gaaffii baayyee gaarii dhuguma
Clothes, it seemed.	Uffata, fakkaata ture.
That was pretty cool.	Sun baayyee namatti tola ture.
They think you owe them something.	Waan tokko akka isaan irraa qabdu itti fakkaata.
I can't know anything outside of it	Isa ala homaa beekuu hin danda'u
I mean, nothing matters	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru jechuu kooti
We don’t do that.	Akkas hin goonu.
I doubt he was telling the truth	Dhugaa dubbate jedheen shakka
It doesn't matter why.	Maaliif akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
What happens after that.	Sana booda maaltu ta'a.
Need.	Fedhii.
I don't know everything.	Waan hundumaa hin beeku.
No one saw him.	Namni isa arge hin jiru.
This was a job.	Kun hojii ture.
I couldn't go back	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenye
Not exactly human.	Sirriitti nama miti.
She’s exactly like me.	Isheen sirriitti akkuma kooti.
Probably not too bad.	Tarii baay'ee hamaa hin ta'u.
It was somewhat in his case.	Dhimma isaa irratti hamma tokko ture.
I still couldn’t believe it	Ammallee amanuu hin dandeenye
There were many of them.	Hedduu turan.
They have three children.	Ijoollee sadii qabu.
I just couldn’t find him.	Isa argachuu qofa hin dandeenye.
That didn’t happen.	Sun hin taane.
It’s not an issue but it’s different from them.	Dhimma miti garuu isaan irraa adda.
It was good money at the time.	Yeroo sanatti qarshii gaarii ture.
I can't do otherwise	Kanaan ala gochuu hin danda'u
They know me.	Isaan na beeku.
I wasn’t in any mood	Miira tokkollee keessa hin turre
This hour.	Sa'aatii kana.
I wondered why he did that	Maaliif akkas godhe jedheen yaade
I don't know what that means.	Maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku.
I couldn’t believe her	Ishee amanuu hin dandeenye
I don’t want him there.	Achitti isa hin barbaadu.
He stayed with them for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan bira ture
We can’t make him do anything.	Homaa akka godhu gochuu hin dandeenyu.
But he thought of the children.	Garuu ijoollee sana yaade.
He didn’t even have clothes	Uffata illee hin qabu ture
I had no idea it was that bad	Akkas hamaa ta'uu isaa yaada hin qabu ture
I mean, it's not about the real thing	Waa'ee waan dhugaa miti jechuu kooti
Good luck.	Carraa gaarii.
He knows what to do for me.	Waan naaf godhu ni beeka.
I couldn't tell anyone about it	Waa'ee kanaa namatti himuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t know where to do it.	Eessa akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
I am just looking for the truth	Ani dhugaa qofa barbaadaa jira
I wasn’t in the mood to go	Miira deemuuf hin turre
I didn't know that about her	Waa'ee ishee akkas hin beeku ture
I didn’t want to be in the house	Mana keessa jiraachuu hin barbaanne
I still don’t want to ask them for money.	Ammas maallaqa isaan gaafachuu hin barbaadu.
This is now clear.	Kun amma ifaadha.
They know the area well.	Naannoo sana sirriitti beeku.
And it wasn’t there yet.	Ammas hin turre.
But it’s different.	Garuu adda.
A completely new language	Afaan guutummaatti haaraa
Now I have many, many ideas	Amma yaada hedduu hedduu qaba
That's what should happen.	Kan ta'uu qabu kanuma.
Another night passed.	Halkan biraa darbe.
No one knew who was right.	Eenyu akka sirrii ta'e namni beeku hin turre.
I think about her all the time	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee ishee nan yaada
I didn't know.	Ani hin beeku ture.
I had no idea where to go from here	As irraa eessa akkan deemu yaada hin qabu ture
But then again, why would I want to.	Garuu sana booda ammas maaliif barbaada.
He did well there.	Achitti waan gaarii hojjete.
It was always there for him	Yeroo hundumaa isaaf ture
There really is no reason for this.	Dhuguma sababni kanaaf hin jiru.
They are always together.	Yeroo hunda waliin jiru.
He thought of everything she was going for	Waan isheen deemtu hunda yaade
Just wait for me.	Na eegaa qofa.
You would know better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekta.
I think everything else is fine	Wanti biraa hundi gaarii natti fakkaata
They were there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi turan.
I had a lot of work to do today	Har'a hojii baay'een qaba ture
Good, but it needs to be great.	Gaarii, garuu guddaa ta'uu qaba.
I love you two more then you will ever know	Lamaan keessan caalaa isin jaalladha sana booda yoomiyyuu ni beektu
He didn’t want his money	Maallaqa isaa hin barbaanne
You’re on the road.	Karaa irra jirta.
I gave him a lot	Waan baay'een isaaf kenne
This is not the case.	Kun akkas miti.
He had so many questions, so much to say	Gaaffii baay'ee, waan baay'ee jedhu qaba ture
I think they’re real	Isaan dhugaa natti fakkaata
She’s right, of course.	Isheen sirrii dha, beekamaadha.
He has one.	Tokko qaba.
You, me, can’t do this alone.	Ati, ana, kophaa keenya kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
What is going on seems pretty simple.	Wanti deemaa jiru baayyee salphaa fakkaata.
We are not your friends.	Nuti hiriyyoota keessan miti.
Neither of us spoke.	Lamaan keenyayyuu hin dubbanne.
Inside the house.	Mana keessaa.
She had no chance.	Carraa hin qabdu turte.
Maybe you mean someone else's.	Tarii kan nama biraa jechuu kee ta'a.
You weren’t there.	Ati hin turre.
I looked up again.	Ammas ol jedheen ilaale.
But he did more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa hojjete.
That time is not now.	Yeroon sun amma miti.
It becomes of itself.	Of ta'a.
But, maybe not.	Garuu, tarii hin ta'u ta'a.
No one was there.	Namni tokkollee achi hin turre.
I hope this helps you	Kun akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba
That’s all you can do.	Kana qofa gochuu dandeessu.
I mean, obviously someone has to do it	Namni tokko gochuu akka qabu ifaadha jechuu kooti
Now it seemed he couldn't even do that.	Amma akkas illee gochuu waan hin dandeenye fakkaata ture.
Without Him, it is nothing.	Isa malee homaa miti.
My friends.	Hiriyyoota koo.
I am very good.	Ani baayyee gaarii dha.
People are not like that.	Namoonni akkas miti.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
I wasn't very emotional	Baay'ee miira keessa hin turre
That’s why it was.	Kanaaf ture.
I’d rather go to both.	Lamaan isaanii bira deemuu naaf wayya.
Not after this night.	Halkan kana booda miti.
In my daughter’s life.	Jireenya intala koo keessatti.
I didn’t really want her here	Ani dhuguma ishee asitti hin barbaanne
You can't do it now.	Amma hin dandeessu.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
I'm glad this happened.	Kun ta'uu isaatti gammadeera.
I didn't want it to be easy.	Salphaa akka ta'u hin barbaanne.
Everyone but her.	Ishee malee namni hundi.
But it certainly wasn’t true.	Garuu dhugaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
I didn’t want to live anymore	Kana booda jiraachuu hin barbaanne
They want to have your car, your house and your wife.	Konkolaataa kee, mana kee fi haadha manaa kee qabaachuu barbaadu.
It works without problems.	Rakkoo malee hojjeta.
I knew exactly what to say, when to say it	Maal akkan jedhu, yoom akkan jedhu sirriitti beeka ture
I would never be like him	Ani gonkumaa akka isaa hin ta'u ture
Again, that’s fine.	Ammas, sun gaarii dha.
Time passed quickly.	Yeroon dafee darbe.
I love it here.	Asitti baay'een jaalladha.
What do they look like.	Maal fakkaatu.
I can tell you this.	Kana sitti himuu nan danda'a.
But it may soon be a thing of the past.	Garuu yeroo dhiyootti waan darbe ta'uu danda'a.
They shouldn’t have your little girl.	Intala kee xiqqoo qabaachuu hin qaban.
It was bad enough for this one	Isa kanaaf hamaa gahaa ture
You have to come.	Dhufuu qabda.
I need someone who knows what he’s doing	Nama waan inni hojjetu beeku na barbaachisa
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
I think that is very important.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
It's not my opinion.	Yaada koo hin ta'u.
I think it was nothing.	Homaa hin turre jedheen yaada.
That's what we did.	Akkas goone.
I mean, obviously someone has to do it.	Namni tokko gochuu akka qabu ifaadha jechuu kooti.
He shouldn’t have given up.	Silaa harka kennuu hin qabu ture.
I really wanted to tell him everything	Waan hundumaa itti himuu baay'een barbaade
A little too soon	Xiqqoo garmalee dafee
I didn't think so.	Ani akkas jedhee hin yaadne.
I was waiting, too	Anis eegaa ture
I knew this was not true	Kun dhugaa akka hin taane nan beeka ture
I didn’t see that.	Sana hin argine.
It was someone else’s picture.	Suuraa nama biraa ture.
But it’s not a big deal.	Garuu waan guddaa miti.
It can be easy.	Salphaa ta’uu danda’a.
This is our time.	Yeroon kun yeroo keenya.
But now he has nothing.	Amma garuu homaa hin qabu.
Which he doesn’t have.	Kan inni hin qabne.
It wasn’t from her.	Ishee irraa hin turre.
I know you want kids	Ijoollee akka barbaaddu nan beeka
Let's see what happened.	Mee maal ta'e ilaalaa.
This is not my dress.	Kun uffata koo miti.
But I think you're good at it	Ati garuu itti gaarii natti fakkaata
Many unanswered questions.	Gaaffii hedduu deebii hin qabne.
They were and they can be again.	Isaan turan ammas ta'uu danda'u.
I have a career going well.	Hojii akka gaariitti deemaa jiru qaba.
I don't know what's going on about this	Waa'ee kanaa maaltu akka ta'aa jiru hin beeku
I couldn't know your question	Gaaffii keessan kana beekuu hin dandeenye
Mine was different.	Kan koo garuu adda ture.
Not that she was .	Isheen akka turte miti .
That’s just me though.	Sun garuu ana qofa.
I just looked up at him	Anis ol jedheen isa ilaale qofa
I didn't know what was going on	Waan ta'aa jiru hin beeku ture
He thinks it's pretty obvious.	Baayyee ifa ta'ee itti fakkaata.
You can see it there.	Achitti arguu dandeessu.
You need to work on these.	Isaan kana irratti hojjechuu qabdu.
It was nothing anymore	Kana booda homaa hin turre
Hope that helps.	Abdiin sun akka gargaaru.
It had to be three.	Sadii ta'uu qaba ture.
But it’s still working.	Garuu ammas hojjechaa jira.
He only had one.	Tokko qofa qaba ture.
It was unforgivable.	Dhiifama kan hin qabne ture.
I love someone who has an idea	Nama yaada qabu nan jaalladha
I could buy this.	Kana bitachuu nan danda'a ture.
No, not really.	Miti dhuguma miti.
I didn’t say anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf homaa hin dubbanne.
We are still there.	Ammas jirra.
It all went perfect.	Hundi isaa guutuu ta'ee deeme.
He has been a good girl.	Intala gaarii ta'ee jira.
I know you did this	Kana akka goote nan beeka
Maybe it's probably.	Tarii ta'uu hin oolu.
I could never see that happening	Yoomiyyuu akkas taʼuu isaa arguu hin dandeenye
But not in my house.	Garuu mana koo keessatti miti.
This may be the case for you.	Kun siif taʼuu dandaʼa.
The problem is, he really loves her.	Rakkoon isaa, dhuguma ishee jaallata.
No one was looking for her.	Namni ishee barbaadu hin turre.
I'm not there.	Ani hin jiru.
That was the most important thing in her life	Jireenya ishee keessatti wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa taʼe sun ture
I didn’t think he had said anything like that before.	Kanaan dura waan akkasii dubbate natti hin fakkaatu ture.
But this didn’t happen.	Garuu kun hin taane.
I went with him, too	Anis isa waliin deeme
Not completely.	Guutummaatti miti.
I should never have left you alone	Silaa gonkumaa kophaa si dhiisuu hin qabu ture
But most people are not.	Garuu namoonni baay'een akkas miti.
Maybe it was true.	Tarii dhugaa ture ta'a.
But they were very, very efficient.	Garuu baayyee baayyee ga'umsa qaban turan.
But now there was no chance.	Garuu amma carraan hin turre.
Can't do much about that.	Sana irratti waan baay'ee hojjechuu hin danda'u.
I am not your teacher.	Ani barsiisaa keessan miti.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Hin danda'u, hin danda'u, hin danda'u.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
But what a feeling when you do.	Garuu yeroo gootu maal miira.
Not sure anyone really knows.	Dhuguma namni beeku akka jiru mirkanaa'aa miti.
I know you’re not.	Ati akka hin taane nan beeka.
I love him, but I can't live with him	Ani isa jaalladha, garuu isa waliin jiraachuu hin danda'u
Not his father.	Abbaa isaa miti.
Everything that can exist will exist.	Wanti jiraachuu danda'u hundi ni jiraata.
But I was wrong.	Ani garuu dogoggora ture.
We saw what happened when she didn't.	Yeroo isheen hin qabne waan ta'e argine.
I don’t understand why not	Maaliif akka hin taane naaf hin galle
I just told him the truth and the truth	Dhugaa fi dhugaa qofa itti hime
It can't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin danda'u.
It’s a good idea.	Yaada gaarii dha.
I wasn't sure it would ever quite happen.	Yoomiyyuu guutummaatti akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
You can't see what he can do like that.	Akkasitti maal gochuu akka danda'u arguu hin dandeessu.
No one can know.	Namni beekuu hin danda'u.
But no one knows anything.	Garuu namni homaa beeku hin jiru.
I just told him the truth	Dhugaa jiru qofa itti hime
Maybe right, maybe wrong.	Tarii sirrii ta'uu danda'a, tarii dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
I could work with you	Si waliin hojjechuu nan danda'a ture
But that can't be the case.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin danda'u.
This was not a mistake.	Kun dogoggora hin turre.
The man.	Namni.
Had to buy some time	Yeroo muraasa bitachuu qaba ture
This is not the case now.	Kun amma miti.
Now, even we.	Amma, nuti illee.
I don't know what happened	Waan ta'e hin beeku
This can matter a great deal.	Kun dhimma guddaa qabaachuu danda’a.
But, this is better.	Garuu, kun wayya.
I went at it for a very long time.	Yeroo baayyee dheeraaf itti deeme.
It wants to be for you	Siif ta'uu barbaada
You have them,' she said.	Isaan qabda,' jette.
We mean this time.	Yeroo kana jechuu keenya.
I'm sure she did.	Akkas akka goote mirkanaa'adha.
This is not easy.	Kun salphaa miti.
Now he has a room	Amma kutaa qaba
They must exist.	Jiraachuu qabu.
I could never be one of them.	Ani gonkumaa isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
He realized this was different.	Kun adda akka ta'e hubate.
I'm going to go too.	Anis deemaa jira.
He has a few but none go to his school.	Muraasa qaba garuu tokkollee mana barumsaa isaa hin deemu.
It's very wrong.	Baayyee dogoggora.
I really have no idea why.	Dhuguma maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
This time, not so much.	Yeroo kana, hangas miti.
No one came along the way.	Namni karaa irra dhufe hin jiru.
The truth about him is no more important than the truth about us.	Dhugaa waa'ee isaa dhugaa waa'ee keenya jiru caalaa barbaachisaa miti.
This can work.	Kun hojjechuu danda'a.
Someone has to be home.	Namni tokko mana ta'uu qaba.
Not better than him.	Isa caalaa miti.
That she was going to do something she really loved.	Waan dhuguma jaallattu hojjechuuf akka turte.
I didn't know what was wrong with you	Maal akka si ta'e hin beeku ture
I wanted to be like my father	Anis akka abbaa koo ta'uu barbaade
This should work much better than that.	Kun kana caalaa baayyee hojjechuu qaba.
Every moment can be important.	Yeroon hundi barbaachisaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I couldn’t really say	Dhuguma jechuu hin dandeenye
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
Thus it was a mistake to believe them.	Akkasitti isaan amanuu dogoggora ture.
He didn't tell me anything.	Homaa natti hin himne.
I thought he did that.	Inni akkas godhe natti fakkaate.
I hope that works.	Sun akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
What came before him.	Waan isa dura dhufe.
I was just trying to help	Gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa ture
It's not the same thing.	Waan tokko miti.
I won't go any other way.	Karaa biraa hin deemu.
I can't say anything else	Waan biraa dubbachuu hin danda'u
Now.	Amma.
Why is this the case?.	Maaliif akkas ta'e?.
I think you have to find someone	Nama argachuu qabda jedheen yaada
They were the same thing.	Isaan waan tokko turan.
Glad to see me.	Na arguu kootti gammadeera.
I thought all you needed was me	Wanti si barbaachisu ana qofa jedheen yaade
He was with us.	Inni nu waliin ture.
It has a problem.	Rakkoo qaba.
I told him, too.	Anis itti hime.
You need to do this.	Kana gochuuf si barbaachisa.
She's probably your daughter.	Isheen intala kee ta'uu hin oolu.
It could have been worse.	Silaa kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
This can only be good	Kun gaarii qofa ta’uu danda’a
This wasn’t good enough.	Kun gaarii hin turre.
They must be.	Ta'uu qabu.
Maybe he should have gone home	Silaa gara manaatti deebi'uu qaba ture ta'a
I thought it would be me	Ana ta'a jedheen yaade
I don't do anything	Ani homaa hin godhu
It could be one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko ta’uu danda’a.
I was in it.	Ani keessa ture.
I wonder where he really lives	Dhuguma eessa jiraata jedheen yaada
I don’t really know what to do.	Maal akkan godhu sirriitti hin beeku.
I think that’s exactly what it was	Sirriitti akkas ture jedheen yaada
There's no reason to be.	Sababni ta'uuf hin jiru.
There was no one like him.	Namni akka isaa hin turre.
Why was she even here.	Maaliif as illee turte.
I said it was mine	Ani kan kooti jedheen ture
But that's not happening.	Garuu sun ta'aa hin jiru.
That says everything about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan hundumaa kanuma jedha.
He wasn't sure why he did it, just that it was right.	Maaliif akka godhe mirkanaa'aa hin turre, sirrii ta'uu isaa qofa.
I would be .	Ani ta'a .
That it came from somewhere else.	Bakka biraa irraa akka dhufe.
I need a new one	Haaraa na barbaachisa
I certainly do.	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha.
Now it's becoming a reality.	Amma dhugaa ta'aa jira.
It took time.	Yeroo fudhate.
It wasn’t just me.	Ana qofa hin turre.
Someone there could help.	Namni achi jiru tokko gargaaruu dandaʼa ture.
He wanted to know what was going on.	Waan ta'aa jiru beekuu barbaade.
So, we are waiting.	Kanaaf, eegaa jirra.
We can’t do it.	Hin dandeenyu.
You have to know her.	Ishee beekuu qabda.
He didn’t talk to anyone	Namatti hin dubbanne
I wasn’t always willing to do that	Yeroo hundumaa akkas gochuuf fedhii hin qabu ture
I didn’t really know him	Ani dhuguma isa hin beeku ture
I really didn’t know what to think	Dhuguma maal akkan yaadu hin beeku ture
We were doing something else at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan biraa hojjechaa turre.
But we shouldn’t have more.	Garuu kana caalaa qabaachuu hin qabnu.
The one that's great.	Kan guddaa ta'e.
I care about you so much	Ani baay'een siif yaada
We hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdii qabna.
I had to do what was best for him	Waan isaaf gaarii taʼe gochuun qaba ture
The time is always now.	Yeroon yeroo hundumaa amma.
He didn't have it.	Hin qabu ture.
It wasn’t too late.	Yeroon booda hin turre.
But I can't help you	Ani garuu si gargaaruu hin danda'u
He didn't have any	Tokkollee hin qabu ture
I was great.	Ani guddaa ture.
He’s a good guy.	Inni gurbaa gaarii dha.
But it’s just a part.	Garuu kutaa qofa.
All that mattered now was the truth.	Amma wanti barbaachisu dhugaa qofa ture.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Kana caalaa maal gochuu akka danda'u hin beeku ture.
I had no questions for him	Gaaffii tokkollee isaaf hin qabu ture
Just wait and see.	Eegaa qofa.
I still can't believe it	Ammallee amanuu hin danda'u
But, it was not to be.	Garuu, ta'uu hin qabu ture.
He told her not to tell anyone	Namatti akka hin himne itti hime
He was in it.	Inni keessa ture.
It’s not a question of whether it really is.	Dhuguma ta’uu fi dhiisuu isaa gaaffii miti.
We just can’t see him.	Isa arguu qofa hin dandeenyu.
I hoped it wasn't about me	Waa'ee koo akka hin taane abdiin qaba ture
These are not easy times.	Yeroon kun yeroo salphaa miti.
I'm better than him.	Ani isa caalaa.
It should be easy enough.	Salphaa gahaa ta'uu qaba.
That could have been a mistake.	Sun dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
It must be with him	Isa waliin ta'uu qaba
Maybe it will happen.	Tarii ni ta'a.
People are interested in him	Namoonni isaaf fedhii qabu
I hope that helps.	Sun akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I wouldn't be here otherwise	Osoo akkas ta'ee as hin jiru ture
I just want to know who you are	Eenyu akka taate qofa beekuu barbaada
You can never be more than you already are.	Ati gonkumaa akka ati duraan jirtu caalaa ta'uu hin dandeessu.
Then something different happened.	Sana booda wanti adda ta'e tokko ta'e.
They were there.	Jiru turan.
It really wasn’t.	Dhuguma hin turre.
I couldn't ask right now	Yeroo ammaa kana gaafachuu hin dandeenye
Then he realized he didn’t want anything.	Sana booda homaa akka hin barbaanne hubate.
I know it's going to happen	Ta'uuf akka jiru nan beeka
It wasn't now.	Amma hin turre.
I have an impossibly large book.	Kitaaba guddaa ta'uu hin dandeenye qaba.
He needs help.	Gargaarsa barbaada.
Many people have.	Namoonni baay'een qaban.
That’s not easy.	Sun salphaa miti.
I didn’t quite know what to say.	Maal akkan jedhu sirriitti hin beeku ture.
I told him that seemed about right	Anis sun gara sirrii fakkaata jedheen itti hime
I don’t say it.	Hin jedhu.
She had had enough.	Isheen gahaa ta'ee turte.
I know what’s going on	Waan deemaa jiru nan beeka
I was glad that wasn’t the case	Akkas akka hin taane nan gammade
Everything was so loud.	Wanti hundi akka malee sagalee guddaa qaba ture.
We went over this.	Kana irra deemne.
He got his money.	Maallaqa isaa argate.
It was obvious that he did.	Akka godhe ifa ture.
I thought it was pretty good	Baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate
Two days, two nights.	Guyyaa lama, halkan lama.
But it would never have happened.	Garuu silaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
I am a wife and a mother	Ani haadha manaa fi haadha
You were then .	Ati yeroo sana turte .
We have it.	Qabna.
I wasn't trying to be nice	Ani nama gaarii ta'uuf yaalaa hin turre
This is going to be a long night.	Kun halkan dheeraa ta'uuf deema.
But not this year.	Bara kana garuu miti.
I know you probably have something to do	Waan hojjechuu qabdu qabaachuu akka hin oolle nan beeka
We had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabnu turre.
I never intended to do it	Ani tasumaa hojjechuuf hin yaadne
I can't believe he did that in his clothes	Uffata isaatiin akkas godhe jedhee amanuu hin danda'u
From their eyes.	Ija isaanii irraa.
I just said he could	Ni danda'a jedheen qofa
It was supposed to be a really great night.	Halkan dhuguma guddaa ta'uu qaba ture.
We are nothing.	Nuti homaa miti.
But it was something.	Garuu waan tokko ture.
Very good stuff.	Waan baayyee gaarii.
Important.	Barbaachisaa.
I love people.	Namoota nan jaalladha.
It's a very good thing.	Waan baayyee gaarii dha.
Maybe someone can help me.	Tarii namni tokko na gargaaruu danda'a.
A lot of people didn't really want it	Namoonni baay'een dhuguma hin barbaanne
It's for you.	Siif ta'a.
He often did.	Yeroo baayʼee ni godha ture.
He would have thought about it.	Silaa itti yaada ture.
I don’t want to know anymore.	Kana booda beekuu hin barbaadu.
It has more than enough	Waan gahaa ol qaba
I think it was probably an accident	Balaa ta'uu hin oolu jedheen yaada
I already know what you meant	Waan ati jechuu akka turte duruu beeka
This is very nice.	Kun baayyee namatti tola.
I can tell you those people are real	Namoonni sun dhugaa ta'uu isaanii sitti himuu nan danda'a
I want to live my best life.	Jireenya koo isa gaarii jiraachuu nan barbaada.
I didn't know that much about it	Waa'ee isaa hangas hin beeku ture
You never have any issues with him.	Isa waliin dhimma tokkollee gonkumaa hin qabdu.
I couldn’t do that	Ani akkas gochuu hin dandeenye
I had no such hesitation	Ani duubatti deebi'uu akkasii hin qabu ture
Maybe not even that long.	Tarii hangas dheeraa illee miti.
I just need to stay a little longer	Xiqqoo turuu qofa na barbaachisa
I didn’t see her do that	Isheen akkas gootu hin argine
But, it seems like that is not the case.	Garuu, akka waan akkas hin taane fakkaata.
This isn’t necessarily a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa ta’uu hin qabu.
It’s still in there.	Ammallee achi keessa jira.
As it was.	Akkuma ture.
Just tell him.	Itti himi qofa.
It still looked like a drink.	Ammallee dhugaatii fakkaata ture.
What to do when things go wrong.	Yeroo wanti tokko dogoggora ta'u maal gochuu qabna.
But it just takes luck.	Garuu carraa qofa barbaachisa.
I shouldn’t have told you that	Silaa akkas sitti himuu hin qabu ture
It couldn't be any different.	Adda ta'uu hin dandeenye.
But he doesn't go.	Garuu hin deemu.
I know you love it	Akka jaallattu nan beeka
A real person would never do that.	Namni dhugaa gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
I wonder why he did that	Maaliif akkas godhe jedheen yaada
Nothing like that happened.	Wanti akkasii hin taane.
I still couldn't get back to my room.	Ammallee gara kutaa kootti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
I couldn't say it.	Jechuu hin dandeenye.
They do, but they need some work.	Ni hojjetu, garuu hojii tokko tokko barbaadu.
But he could do it.	Garuu gochuu danda'a ture.
I hadn't thought much of it.	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne ture.
I’m, like, excited.	Ani, akka, gammadeera.
It just works.	Hojjeta qofa.
I just need some sleep	Hirriba xiqqoo qofa na barbaachisa
I thought everyone got one	Namni hundi tokko argate jedheen yaade
But that should be an exception.	Garuu sun ala ta’uu qaba.
He was wrong about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dogoggora ture.
I can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu hin danda'u.
He looked again, this time longer	Ammas ilaale, yeroo kana dheeraa
Maybe that's a bad answer.	Tarii sun deebii hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
It’s not that important.	Hangas barbaachisaa miti.
Works great for me.	Naaf guddaa hojjeta.
She holds her hand against me a little.	Xiqqoo harka ishee natti qabdi.
They are not the same thing.	Isaan waan tokko miti.
He was doing the right thing	Waan sirrii hojjechaa ture
He wasn’t really in danger.	Dhuguma balaa keessa hin turre.
They know the truth of the situation.	Dhugaa haala jiru ni beeku.
That could only have come from him.	Sun isa irraa qofa dhufuu danda’a ture.
I am nothing like you	Ani akka kee homaa miti
I couldn’t have that	Sana qabaachuu hin dandeenye
We hope it goes well.	Akka gaariitti akka deemu abdii qabna.
he got it a year later.	waggaa tokko booda argate.
I didn’t talk to her	Ishee waliin hin dubbanne
I have to tell you about the car	Waa'ee konkolaataa sitti himuu qaba
But this was not true.	Garuu kun dhugaa hin turre.
We only need one.	Tokko qofa nu barbaachisa.
I haven’t been completely honest with you	Guutummaatti siif dhugaa hin dubbanne
There was nothing he had to give me.	Wanti inni naaf kennuu qabu hin turre.
In the bar.	Mana dhugaatii keessatti.
That night, for the most part, she was gone.	Halkan sana, irra caalaa, isheen hin turre.
That was a really good hour.	Sun sa'aatii gaarii dhuguma ture.
Tell them what's going on here.	Waan asitti ta'aa jiru itti himi.
As .	Akka .
It happened much later.	Baayyee booda ta'e.
I couldn’t believe he was doing this to me	Akkas na gochaa jira jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
I was interested in her but he was right there	Ani fedhii ishee ture garuu inni sirriitti achi ture
I didn't want to talk about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne.
But he didn't understand.	Garuu hin hubanne.
He said very little.	Baayyee xiqqoo jedhe.
And I went out.	Anis ba'e.
I didn’t quite know what to say	Maal akkan jedhu sirriitti hin beeku ture
It was all good .	Hundi isaa gaarii ture .
Maybe there's even some truth to it.	Tarii dhugaa tokko tokko illee jiraachuu danda'a.
I didn’t think it was necessary before	Kanaan dura barbaachisaa natti hin fakkaatu ture
I couldn’t go any further	Kana caalaa deemuu hin dandeenye
I didn’t see anyone else.	Nama biraa hin argine.
No other can do that	Kan biraa akkas gochuu hin danda'u
He didn’t go, he doesn’t exist.	Inni hin deemne, hin jiru.
It's a very good idea.	Yaada baayyee gaarii dha.
But sometimes, it happens.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko, ni ta'a.
I'm really excited about this year.	Bara kana baay'een gammadeera.
But this should be an exception.	Garuu kun ala ta’uu qaba.
I didn’t know what to make of her	Maal akkan ishee godhu hin beeku ture
I didn’t want to see them	Isaan arguu hin barbaanne
Everything but his own.	Kan isaa malee waan hunda.
I will be a completely different person	Ani nama guutummaatti adda ta'e ta'a
He looked at her for a moment.	Yeroo xiqqoo ishee ilaale.
I can make you whatever you want to be	Waan ta'uu barbaaddu si gochuu nan danda'a
It was something.	Waan tokko ture.
I want to be that person too	Anis nama sana ta'uu barbaada
And now and ever.	Ammas ta'ee yoomiyyuu.
I didn’t do this for me	Ani kana naaf hin goone
He shouldn’t be here.	Inni as jiraachuu hin qabu.
New name, new life	Maqaa haaraa, jireenya haaraa
He didn’t do that.	Inni akkas hin goone.
That wasn’t entirely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre.
Very bad feeling.	Miira baayyee hamaa.
But it's pretty good.	Garuu baayyee gaarii dha.
We should have had enough.	Silaa gahaa qabaachuu qabna turre.
Without any money.	Maallaqa tokko malee.
I’m not interested in helping her any more	Kana caalaa ishee gargaaruuf fedhii hin qabu
The problem is that there is none.	Rakkoon inni hin jiru.
About everything else.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa.
We had nothing.	Homaa hin qabnu turre.
That seems unnecessary.	Sun waan hin barbaachifne fakkaata.
But I thought about it	Ani garuu itti yaade
I rarely want one.	Tokkollee yeroo muraasaaf barbaada.
None of that could have happened.	Sana keessaa tokkollee taʼuu hin dandaʼu ture.
You are this time.	Ati yeroo kana.
I don't do that.	Ani akkas hin godhu.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
Maybe he didn't have one.	Tarii tokko hin qabu ture ta'a.
I don't understand	Naaf hin galle
I have to do something nice for him	Waan gaarii isaaf gochuun qaba
I would have loved a picture of that	Silaa suuraa sanaa baay'een jaalladha ture
I love this so much.	Kana baay'een jaalladha.
I totally belonged there.	Ani guutummaatti kan achi ture.
You're not there.	Ati hin jirtu.
Hopefully you already know this.	Kana duruu akka beektu abdii qabna.
That doesn't sound like much.	Sun waan baay'ee hin fakkaatu.
I recognize that voice	Sagalee sana nan beeka
But that’s not good enough anymore.	Garuu kana booda sun gaarii miti.
I think that’s a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
That would have been better.	Sun wayya ture.
It requires a lot.	Baay'ee barbaada.
I may not know tomorrow.	Boru beekuu dhiisuu danda'a.
I came here looking for a way to do that	Karaa sana itti godhu barbaadaa as dhufe
I like that I can help them	Isaan gargaaruu akkan danda'u natti tola
So someone wondered what was going on.	Kanaaf namni tokko maaltu ta'aa jira jedhee yaade.
He has such excellent clothes	Uffata baayyee gaarii akkasii qaba
I know you won’t	Akka hin goone nan beeka
This was not my era.	Kun bara koo hin turre.
This is obviously going to be different.	Kun adda ta'uuf akka jiru ifaadha.
He had my place.	Bakka koo qaba ture.
I had no idea what to think	Maal akkan yaadu yaada hin qabu ture
Today was a little different.	Har'a garuu xiqqoo adda ture.
That's exactly how it should be.	Sirriitti akkas ta'uu qaba.
It was after this year.	Bara kana booda ture.
Think about it for a moment.	Mee yeroo muraasaaf yaadu.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
He should have gone earlier	Silaa kanaan dura deemuu qaba ture
I thought we understood each other	Wal hubanne natti fakkaate
You know what’s coming.	Waan dhufu beekta.
It must be with you	Si waliin ta'uu qaba
It was a great idea guy.	Gurbaa yaada guddaa ture.
But you don't love me.	Ati garuu na hin jaallattu.
I don't know what to say now.	Amma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku.
I was with some guy friends	Hiriyyoota gurbaa tokko tokko waliin ture
I can't get it now.	Amma argachuu hin danda'u.
I knew what that other thing had to be	Wanti biraa sun maal ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture
He wasn’t the right person.	Namni sirrii hin turre.
I have two thoughts on that	Sana irratti yaada lama qaba
She was in school.	Mana barumsaa keessa turte.
We did the best we could .	Waan dandeenyu hunda hojjenne .
I would love to see her again	Ammas yoo ishee arguu baay'een jaalladha
I’m willing to go with you though .	Si waliin deemuuf fedhii qaba garuu .
We are watching you.	Isin ilaalaa jirra.
It would have worked fine.	Silaa gaarii hojjeta ture.
The opportunity for a new life	Carraa jireenya haaraa
isn’t that such a simple question?.	gaaffii salphaa akkasii mitii?.
I knew then we had to go	Yeroo sanatti deemuun akka qabnu nan beeka ture
Nothing happened without him.	Isa malee wanti ta'e hin jiru.
I didn’t mean anything.	Homaa jechuu koo hin turre.
He is extremely good.	Inni garmalee gaarii dha.
But then again, just maybe.	Garuu sana booda ammas, tarii qofa.
This was something new, he thought.	Kun waan haaraa ture jedhee yaade.
I knew her mother very well	Haadha ishee baay'een beeka ture
Look at it from their eyes.	Ija isaanii irraa ilaalaa.
I haven’t for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf hin qabu
These, however, are different.	Isaan kun garuu adda adda.
you must have.	qabaachuu qabda.
I usually go a lot	Yeroo baayyee baay'een deema
I didn’t see what you had	Waan ati qabdu hin argine
Therefore, it is a must.	Kanaaf dirqama.
I love my wife very much	Haadha manaa koo baay'een jaalladha
His everyday life.	Jireenya isaa guyyaa guyyaa.
I still have work to do	Ammallee hojiin qaba
On my way.	Karaa koo irra.
It’s been there for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf jira
He looked his way again	Ammas karaa isaa ilaale
No one knew who we were.	Eenyu akka taane namni beeku hin turre.
This was not a new idea.	Kun yaada haaraa hin turre.
I was never sure.	Ani gonkumaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Often this is not an excuse.	Yeroo baay’ee kun sababa hin ta’u.
I had to do it, but still	Gochuun qaba ture, garuu ammas
I would have been better off without them	Isaan malee naaf wayya ture
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
Except for their children.	Ijoollee isaanii malee.
Just another time.	Yeroo biraa qofa.
I need your opinion on this	Waan kana irratti yaada keessan barbaada
I knew there had to be something	Waan tokko jiraachuu akka qabu nan beeka ture
I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do	Waan sirrii ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
No one comes from that place now.	Amma bakka sana keessaa namni dhufu hin jiru.
I still had nothing to say	Ammallee waanan jedhu hin qabu ture
I will never be in that situation again	Kana booda yoomiyyuu haala sana keessa hin jiru
It’s better if you don’t know.	Yoo hin beekne wayya.
I need your opinion on something.	Waan tokko irratti yaada keessan na barbaachisa.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
I don’t know why it works, but it does.	Maaliif akka hojjetu hin beeku, garuu ni hojjeta.
All she wanted was a home.	Wanti isheen barbaaddu mana qofa ture.
I can't really find a clear answer	Dhuguma deebii ifa ta'e argachuu hin danda'u
He would have loved to stay.	Silaa turuu ni jaallata ture.
It’s not my business, it’s not your business.	Dhimma koo miti, dhimma kee miti.
I thought you couldn't be from here.	As irraa ta'uu hin dandeessu jedheen yaade.
I am not one of those people	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko miti
I wasn't sure it probably was	Tarii akka ture mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I was going to leave	Anis deemuuf ture
She never knew her father again.	Kana booda abbaa ishee hin beekne.
That would have been easy.	Silaa sun salphaa ture.
I doubt that.	Kana nan shakka.
I have nothing bad to say about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hamaa dubbachuu hin qabu.
I know it's a perfectly simple and obvious question	Gaaffii guutummaatti salphaa fi ifa ta'e akka ta'e nan beeka
Boy! 	Gurbaa!
But not yet.	Garuu ammallee miti.
Now this is very important.	Amma kun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
There is nothing new about this idea, however.	Waa'ee yaada kanaa garuu wanti haaraa ta'e hin jiru.
You said you did it.	Ati goote jette.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Sun dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
That didn’t happen.	Sun hin taane.
He thought that would be the case at home.	Mana keessatti akkas ta'a jedhee yaade.
So much for waiting.	Eegaa baay'ee.
Even that does not help much.	Sun illee baayʼee hin gargaaru.
John told me.	Yohaannis natti hime.
Not that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura miti.
I just didn’t know what to do	Ani garuu maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture
I was looking for some things	Waan tokko tokko barbaadaa ture
So much indeed.	Kanaaf baay'ee dhuguma.
But she wasn't there.	Garuu isheen achi hin turre.
Nothing would work.	Wanti tokkollee hin hojjetu ture.
But that's just me.	Garuu sun ana ta'uu koo qofa.
But I couldn't do it	Ani garuu gochuu hin dandeenye
Not after today.	Har'a booda miti.
I want to go back to my room	Gara kutaa kootti deebi'uu barbaada
But not here.	Garuu asitti miti.
I have no idea what this could be.	Kun maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu.
We have to see it.	Arguu qabna.
He wanted to go back in the house	Mana keessa deebi'uu barbaade
Not a single day and not a single night later.	Guyyaa tokkollee hin taane halkan tokkollee booda hin jiru.
The feel of his hands on her.	Miira harka isaa ishee irratti.
My children.	Ijoollee koo.
It shouldn't be like that.	Akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
Which is just as good.	Kan akkuma kana gaarii ta'e.
I can't give you any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee siif kennuu hin danda'u.
More than yourself, to be with.	Ofii caalaa, waliin ta'uuf.
I'm sure she knew things weren't right.	Wanti sirrii akka hin taane akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
I wasn't sure what he meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaade mirkanaa'aa hin turre
Most of the time it was nothing.	Yeroo baayyee homaa hin turre.
They want me.	Na barbaadu.
How should we know.	Akkamitti beekuu qabna.
I wish I had known him	Silaa osoo isa beekuu natti tola ture
He loves me.	Inni na jaallata.
I didn’t know there was such a thing	Wanti akkasii akka jiru hin beeku ture
I can't live like that	Akkas jiraachuu hin danda'u
I think it’s a disaster	Balaa natti fakkaata
I couldn’t live without him	Isa malee jiraachuu hin dandeenye
He looked at him completely	Guutummaatti isa ilaale
I'm good at that.	Ani sana irratti ga'umsa qaba.
I have to go with you.	Si waliin deemuu qaba.
That's going to be us.	Sun nu ta'uuf deema.
Really, really good.	Dhuguma, dhuguma gaarii dha.
I may not know much about my husband	Waa'ee abbaa manaa koo baay'ee beekuu dhiisuu danda'a
I don't know.	Ani hin beeku.
I hadn’t thought of doing anything like that	Waan akkasii hojjechuuf hin yaadne ture
I knew him well enough.	Ani akka gaariitti isa beeka ture.
I think you are one of those people	Nama akkasii keessaa tokko taate jedheen yaada
I want you to say nothing	Homaa akka hin dubbanne nan barbaada
Only a few times.	Yeroo muraasa qofa.
He didn't say anything else	Waan biraa hin dubbanne
He didn't talk about it	Waa'ee isaa hin dubbanne
Can't really ask for anything more.	Kana caalaa dhuguma waan tokko gaafachuu hin danda'u.
I absolutely love it.	Ani guutummaatti nan jaalladha.
Lots of work.	Hojii baay'ee.
And I did exactly that.	Anis sirriitti akkas godhe.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Wanti hundi waan gaarii deemu fakkaata ture.
I must be the one.	Ani ta'uu qaba.
I want to know who we are in my area	Naannoo koo keessatti eenyu akka taane beekuu barbaada
I don't understand why this happened	Kun maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle
I was just telling the truth	Ani dhugaa dubbachuu qofa ture
I want that to be clear	Sun ifa akka ta'u nan barbaada
I didn't understand what was happening at all	Waan ta'aa jiru tasumaa naaf hin galle
But it was only for a while.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa ture.
Not for him.	Isaaf miti.
No one came to see me.	Namni na arguu dhufe hin jiru.
A few, even.	Muraasa, illee.
Tell me something.	Waan tokko natti himi.
I didn’t think about it.	Hin yaadne.
I think we were like that.	Akkas turre natti fakkaata.
Your time is not now.	Yeroon keessan amma miti.
Then something goes wrong.	Sana booda wanti tokko dogoggora ta'a.
He knew that voice too well	Sagalee sana garmalee sirriitti beeka ture
She has no feelings.	Miira tokkollee hin qabdu.
He didn't do that.	Akkas hin goone.
This is obviously wrong.	Kun dogoggora akka ta’e beekamaadha.
I mean, she’s like my mother	Akka haadha kooti jechuu kooti
That’s not like you.	Sun akka kee miti.
He is still here with us.	Ammallee as nu waliin jira.
And yet, they’re there.	Ammas ta’ee, isaan achi jiru.
It didn’t work once.	Yeroo tokko hin hojjenne.
He could get anything he wanted from her.	Waan barbaade ishee irraa argachuu danda'a ture.
I can help you and help myself	Si gargaaruu fi of gargaaruu nan danda'a
She didn't need this.	Kana ishee hin barbaachifne.
Look at me, look at us.	Na ilaalaa, nu ilaalaa.
He wants the truth	Dhugaa barbaada
He must know what is going on	Waan deemaa jiru beekuu qaba
We’ve been working on a lot of work.	Hojii hedduu irratti hojjechaa turre.
I was glad to help	Gargaaruu kootti gammadeera
No one knows what that’s like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu namni beeku hin jiru.
This is the opportunity.	Carraan jiru kana.
Those were apologies.	Isaan sun dhiifama gaafachuu turan.
I just didn’t have that desire	Fedhii sana qofa hin qabu ture
I used to think they were friends	Duraan hiriyyoota natti fakkaata ture
I couldn’t find another one like this	Kan akka kanaa kan biraa argachuu hin dandeenye
He wanted them, but he couldn’t find them	Isaan barbaada ture, garuu argachuu hin dandeenye
She didn’t know what to do with those two.	Isaan lamaan sana maal akka gootu hin beektu turte.
This is important to us.	Kun nuuf barbaachisaa dha.
I didn’t tell my parents	Warra kootti hin himne
People could only see them.	Namoonni isaan qofa arguu dandaʼu turan.
He wanted to stay a while	Yeroo xiqqoo turuu barbaade
They will do it again.	Ammas ni godhu.
He knew he had a chance.	Carraa akka qabu ni beeka ture.
I won’t do that this time	Yeroo kana akkas hin godhu
It’s not without a path.	Karaa hin qabne miti.
I love you all more than life	Jireenya caalaa hunda keessan jaalladha
You think you love me.	Na jaallattu sitti fakkaata.
Just say it.	Jedhu qofa.
How and when.	Akka fi yoom.
I didn’t do anything to you	Ani homaa si hin goone
But I didn't think about it	Ani garuu itti hin yaadne
They really love me.	Isaan dhuguma na jaallatu.
I knew this was wrong	Kun dogoggora akka ta'e nan beeka ture
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
You know.	Ati beekta.
His was a little different.	Kan isaa xiqqoo adda ture.
I really do.	Dhuguma nan godha.
It can't be too easy.	Baayyee salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
I hadn’t made any mistakes	Dogoggora tokkollee hin hojjenne ture
I wanted him, all of him	Ani isa barbaade, hunda isaa
I was already and he wouldn’t come	Ani duraan ture inni hin dhufu ture
I knew exactly what she meant	Maal jechuu akka barbaaddu sirriitti beeka ture
He wasn’t great.	Inni guddaa hin turre.
It would be easier.	Salphaa ta'a ture.
That was a great thing	Sun waan guddaa ture
That sounds bad, but it’s not.	Sun hamaa fakkaata, garuu akkas miti.
I didn’t think anything of it.	Ani homaa itti hin yaadne.
It’s just too real.	Garmalee dhugaa qofa.
We don’t have a room together.	Kutaa tokko waliin hin qabnu.
As you are now.	Akkuma amma jirtu.
He is not like that in his own person.	Inni nama ofii keessatti akkas miti.
' year'.	' waggaa'.
I don't say anything.	Ani homaa hin jedhu.
I love having everyone in the house.	Nama hunda mana keessa jiraachuu nan jaalladha.
I make all things new	Waan hundumaa haaraa nan godha
That seemed like a good idea.	Sun yaada gaarii fakkaata ture.
What it looks like there.	Achitti maal fakkaata.
I thought you had the problem, not me	Ati rakkoo qabu natti fakkaate malee ana miti
She didn’t have to.	Isheen dirqama hin turre.
I want him to be his own person.	Nama ofii akka ta'u nan barbaada.
So they have to.	Kanaaf qabu.
But in reality,.	Garuu dhugaa jiru keessatti,.
They can all be the same.	Hundi isaanii wal fakkaatu ta'uu danda'a.
I always knew it	Yeroo hundumaa nan beeka ture
I knew this was going to happen	Kun akka ta'uuf jiru nan beeka ture
I never knew who it was	Eenyu akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku ture
Every morning is new.	Ganama ganama haaraa dha.
I’m, of course, looking at all the possibilities	Ani, beekamaadha, waan ta’uu danda’u hunda ilaalaa jira
I still don’t understand what he means	Maal jechuu akka barbaade hanga ammaatti naaf hin galle
I'm not involved.	Ani harka keessa hin jiru.
I know him very well	Ani baay'ee gaarii isa beeka
It was not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin turre.
I was outside looking inside	Ani ala ture keessa ilaalaa ture
I really think so.	Dhuguma akkas jedheen yaada.
That's what I wanted	Anis kanuma barbaade
During the day.	Guyyaa keessa.
I mean, there’s nothing out there	Wanti ala jiru hin jiru jechuu kooti
I just can't believe it.	Ani qofa amanuu hin danda'u.
I have no idea what’s coming.	Waan dhufu yaada hin qabu.
And yet it happened!.	Ammas ta'ee!.
Maybe he just can.	Tarii inni qofa danda'a ta'a.
I had nothing more to say to this person	Nama kanaan kana caalaa waanan jedhu hin qabu ture
It was what he was doing, really.	Waan inni hojjechaa ture ture, dhuguma.
It wasn’t like that for us.	Nuuf akkas hin turre.
I can't be everywhere and do everything quickly	Bakka hunda ta'ee waan hunda dafee hojjechuu hin danda'u
Nobody cared about anything.	Namni homaa dhimma itti ba'e hin turre.
That seems to be what happened in this case.	Dhimma kana keessatti kan ta’e kanuma fakkaata.
I never wanted to be different	Adda ta'uu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
He is not like us.	Inni akka keenya miti.
It’s not required, but probably not a bad idea.	Hin barbaachisu, garuu tarii yaada hamaa miti.
He knew that fact.	Dhugaa sana ni beeka ture.
He wouldn't even tell anyone her name.	Maqaa ishee illee namatti hin himu ture.
I know what she’s going through	Waan isheen keessa jirtu nan beeka
Look at them.	Isaan ilaalaa.
I know you have to find something	Waan tokko argachuu akka qabdu nan beeka
Maybe they still can.	Tarii ammallee ni danda'u ta'a.
It worked out.	Ni hojjete.
I can't do anything wrong	Waan hamaa hojjechuu hin danda'u
I didn’t realize she felt this way	Akkasitti miira akka qabdu hin hubanne
I can't tell you any more	Kana caalaa sitti himuu hin danda'u
She is my wife.	Isheen haadha manaa kooti.
And yet, not ever.	Ammas ta'ee gonkumaa miti.
But this has not happened so far.	Kun garuu hanga ammaatti hin taane.
That works so far.	Sun hanga ammaatti ni hojjeta.
I couldn’t understand why he was looking at me like that	Maaliif akkasitti na ilaalaa akka ture naaf hin galle
He was a great guy and a great class.	Gurbaa guddaa fi kutaa guddaa ture.
But that’s not enough.	Garuu sun gahaa miti.
It was only a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa ture.
I think of them as my good fortune	Akka carraa gaarii kootti isaan yaada
We had no idea what to do.	Maal goonu yaada hin qabnu turre.
Everything else was fine.	Wanti biraa hundi gaarii ture.
He didn’t know if he had time.	Yeroo qabaachuu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku ture.
It could still be about.	Ammas waa'ee ta'uu danda'a.
I wonder where he is	Eessa jira jedheen yaada
It seemed like a good idea at the time	Yeroo sanatti yaada gaarii natti fakkaate
But it wasn't supposed to be.	Garuu ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I don't know anything about it	Waa'ee isaa homaa hin beeku
He has everything tonight	Halkan kana waan hunda qaba
It was a little different.	Xiqqoo adda ture.
I just couldn’t leave him alone.	Kophaa isaa dhiisuu qofa hin dandeenye.
I have no one in me at all	Ani tasumaa nama of keessaa hin qabu
Not at that time.	Yeroo sana miti.
Clearly, it is not.	Akka hin taane ifaadha.
How everyone is doing the same thing.	Akkamitti namni hundi waan tokko hojjechaa jiru.
It’s not enough of him.	Isa gahaa miti.
He still wants to be me	Ammas ana ta'uu barbaada
He said he didn't have it.	Hin qabu ture jedhe.
I just couldn’t say it.	Jechuu qofa hin dandeenye.
I really didn’t want an answer	Dhuguma deebii hin barbaadu ture
It could not have been otherwise.	Silaa akkas ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
He knew everything and everyone.	Waan hundumaa fi nama hunda beeka ture.
Made everything really easy.	Waan hundumaa dhuguma salphaa godhe.
They are my only true friends.	Hiriyyoota koo dhugaa isaan qofa.
I think you should apologize to me	Dhiifama naaf gaafachuu qabda jedheen yaada
This one isn’t like that.	Inni kun akkas miti.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
It was a good episode.	Kutaa gaarii ture.
Must be him with the room	Kutaa waliin isa ta'uu qaba
It was two years.	Waggaa lama ture.
I don't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
Please, just let me think.	Maaloo, akkan yaadu qofa.
But you have to stay here until then.	Garuu hanga sanatti as turuu qabda.
We are looking for work.	Hojii barbaadaa jirra.
I didn’t want to know.	Ani beekuu hin barbaanne.
I didn’t know them in here	As keessa isaan hin beeku ture
I can't help you without the truth.	Dhugaa malee si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I may be an extreme case.	Ani dhimma garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
I mean, he was never, ever that into me.	Inni gonkumaa, gonkumaa akkasitti gara kootti hin turre jechuu kooti.
I can't think of anything else to do	Waan biraa hojjechuuf yaadu hin danda'u
It came to me.	Natti dhufe.
I know now that only children make these mistakes	Dogoggora kana kan godhu ijoollee qofa akka ta'e amma beeka
I think it was great	Guddaa ture jedheen yaada
Her chance was now.	Carraan ishee amma ture.
He is almost unconscious	Of hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama
Great job on their hands though.	Hojii guddaa harka isaanii irratti garuu.
That’s not a problem.	Sun rakkoo miti.
I know you can’t forgive me	Dhiifama naaf gochuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
That seems to work fine.	Sun sirriitti waan hojjetu fakkaata.
He should have gone home	Silaa gara manaatti deebi'uu qaba ture
This would not be one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko hin ta'u ture.
I totally want to be with you	Guutummaatti si waliin ta'uu barbaada
I wasn’t for you	Ani siif hin turre
As it happens.	Akkuma akkas ta'u.
But he did it.	Garuu ni godhe.
It's just an answer.	Deebii qofa.
That's nothing.	Sun homaa miti.
I mean, this was it.	Kun ture jechuu kooti.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
You don’t seem to be.	Hin fakkaattu.
Perhaps it is true.	Tarii dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I wouldn't be able to get a job	Silaa hojii argachuu hin danda'u ture
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
I looked at the money in my hand	Maallaqa harka koo keessa jiru ilaale
He still hadn't even seen her	Ammallee ishee arguu illee hin qabu ture
I want to be like her	Anis akka ishee ta'uu barbaada
I certainly don’t know	Ani akkan hin beekne beekamaadha
It’s not like you don’t see it.	Akka hin argine miti.
I like good food, with good people	Nyaata gaarii, namoota gaarii wajjin nyaachuu nan jaalladha
He wanted a dog more than anything	Waan hundumaa caalaa saree barbaada ture
You’re that person.	Ati nama sana.
House, wife.	Mana, haadha manaa.
I didn't want to go back there anymore	Kana booda achitti deebi'uu hin barbaanne
I want this.	Ani kana barbaada.
He thought he knew everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hunda waan beeku itti fakkaate.
We went almost everywhere.	Bakka hunda jechuun ni danda’ama deemne.
They’re not the only ones.	Isaan qofa miti.
I definitely don’t want to	Ani akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha
Loud, loud, loud!.	Sagalee guddaa, sagalee guddaa, sagalee guddaa!.
I looked towards my door	Gara balbala kootti ilaale
But it didn’t seem necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu ture.
I just can't leave him	Isa dhiisuu qofa hin danda'u
She would go no further.	Isheen kana caalaa hin deemtu turte.
I want to be that person	Ani nama sana ta'uu barbaada
Don’t you have any other jobs? 	Hojii biraa hin qabduu?
So far very few.	Hanga ammaatti baayyee muraasa.
But maybe you could do it.	Garuu tarii gochuu dandeessa turte.
You know what you need to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu ni beekta.
He was always a great father.	Yeroo hundumaa abbaa guddaa ture.
He never has a good answer to his question.	Gaaffii isaa kanaaf deebii gaarii gonkumaa hin qabu.
I couldn't tell anyone.	Namatti himuu hin dandeenye.
It seems to be working.	Waan hojjechaa jiru fakkaata.
He can't seem to see anything at all	Tasumaa homaa arguu hin danda'u fakkaata
So it always happens.	Kanaaf yeroo hundumaa ni ta'a.
I love all this about you	Waa'ee kee kana hunda nan jaalladha
But you can't.	Garuu hin dandeessu.
I just don’t know what else to do.	Waan biraa akkan godhu qofa hin beeku.
He wanted to buy them	Isaan bitachuu barbaade
I didn't have many friends	Hiriyyoota baay'ee hin qabu ture
He knows she’s not.	Isheen akka hin taane ni beeka.
If it's not me, the dog.	Yoo ana hin taane saree.
You just need to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu qofa si barbaachisa.
I knew you loved it	Akka ati jaallattu nan beeka ture
You obviously know nothing about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa akka hin beekne ifaadha.
I don’t know what to make of this.	Kana maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
It’s just what you do.	Kan ati gootu qofa.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
I didn’t see him go	Yeroo deemu hin argine
But he realized something else.	Garuu waan biraa hubate.
He knew exactly what he was doing tonight	Halkan kana maal akka hojjetu sirriitti beeka ture
It’s not just good.	Gaarii qofa miti.
I shouldn’t have told him	Silaa itti himuu hin qabu ture
But that was a long time ago	Garuu sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture
I can do it for you in just an hour	Sa'aatii tokko qofa keessatti siif gochuu nan danda'a
I didn’t see him here tonight	Halkan kana asitti isa hin argine
Much more, but not with us	Baay'ee caalaa, garuu nu waliin miti
I'm just that good	Ani akkas qofa gaarii dha
I couldn't believe it was her	Ishee ta'uu ishee amanuu hin dandeenye
I know her feelings	Miira ishee nan beeka
I thought you might like to see something very different	Waan baayyee adda ta'e arguu jaallattu ta'a jedheen yaade
But now it doesn't exist.	Amma garuu hin jiru.
That it was.	Akka ture.
I didn’t want to tell him anything	Homaa itti himuu hin barbaanne
They must be.	Isaan ta'uu qabu.
I want you in my life	Jireenya koo keessatti si barbaada
Never enough, he thought.	Gonkumaa gahaa miti jedhee yaade.
One there, there were many.	Tokko achitti, baay'ee turan.
Not sure what could have gone wrong.	Silaa maaltu dogoggora ta'uu akka danda'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
I certainly could do that	Ani akkas gochuu akkan dandaʼu beekamaadha
They had none of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin qaban turan.
But it would be different if we did it right now.	Garuu yeroo ammaa kana osoo goone adda ta'a.
What just happened.	Waan amma ta'e.
We didn’t say anything to each other.	Homaa wal hin dubbanne.
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
I'm nowhere to be found	Ani bakka hin jiru
From returning to his parents' house.	Mana warra isaatti deebi'uu irraa.
You think you are different.	Ati adda ofitti fakkaata.
This is just a human being.	Kun nama qofa.
Which is lucky.	Kan carraa ta'e.
I think he even said that himself.	Ofii illee akkas jedhe natti fakkaata.
You know, knowing his way around.	Beektaa, karaa isaa beekuu.
Glad I stayed there	Achi turuu kootti gammadeera
I like things my way	Wantoota akka kootti nan jaalladha
You have to come right	Sirriitti dhufuu qabda
People say they saw him.	Namoonni isa argine jedhu.
I don't know you.	Si hin beeku.
I could still see him	Ammallee isa arguu nan dandaʼa ture
It's going to be a good time.	Yeroo gaarii ta'uuf deema.
I hope they were good	Gaarii akka turan abdiin qaba
You need to know this.	Kana beekuu qabda.
I probably never will	Ani tarii gonkumaa hin godhu
I didn’t love him anymore	Kana booda isa hin jaalladhu ture
He loves you.	Inni si jaallata.
He always had a room.	Yeroo hunda kutaa tokko qaba ture.
I mean, just look at her	Ishee qofa ilaalaa jechuu kooti
I thought we talked about it earlier.	Duraan waa'ee isaa waan dubbanne natti fakkaate.
But she didn't go.	Isheen garuu hin deemne.
He doesn’t have to give himself up	Of kennuu hin qabu
It works well now.	Amma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
That hadn’t happened before.	Kanaan dura sun hin taane ture.
I have nothing against cats	Ani saree irratti homaa hin qabu
He didn't need it.	Isa hin barbaachifne.
That’s really nice of them.	Sun dhuguma isaan keessaa namatti tola.
People weren’t really expecting it.	Namoonni dhuguma hin eegaa turan.
I don't know who it is	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku
This would not work.	Kun hin hojjetu ture.
I think they’ve been waiting for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf eegaa turan natti fakkaata
They were looking for their mother.	Haadha isaanii barbaadaa turan.
Problems can be opportunities	Rakkoon carraa ta’uu danda’a
I have to apologize to you	Dhiifama siif gaafachuu qaba
It shouldn’t go long	Yeroo dheeraa deemuu hin qabu
I'm working on it now	Amma irratti hojjechaa jira
It's not hers.	Kan ishee hin taane.
You can see them like this in this picture.	Suuraa kana irratti akkasitti isaan arguu dandeessu.
It was together.	Waliin ture.
But that’s all.	Garuu kana qofa.
Everything seemed fine	Wanti hundi gaarii natti fakkaate
A clear picture.	Suuraa ifa ta'e.
It’s not like it used to be.	Akka durii miti.
He wasn’t the only one.	Isa qofa hin turre.
Alone for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf kophaa ta'ee.
I was with him on that	Sana irratti isa waliin ture
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Kana booda waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
I didn’t think he was in danger	Balaa keessa waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu ture
I can't stay here any longer	Kana booda as turuu hin danda'u
He said he left his wife for me.	Haadha manaa isaa naaf dhiisuu isaa dubbate.
I really didn’t want this	Dhuguma kana hin barbaanne
I didn’t need any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
I couldn’t see his eyes.	Ija isaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I know that he cares deeply about you	Inni baayʼee akka si yaadu nan beeka
I have hope, he thought to himself	Abdiin qaba jedhee ofitti yaade
I had no idea what he wanted	Waan inni barbaadu homaa hin beeku ture
I always have something to say	Yeroo hundumaa waanan jedhu qaba
I can't say it.	jechuu hin danda'u.
I have nothing more to say here	Kana caalaa asitti waanan jedhu hin qabu
Like that's ever going to happen.	Akkuma sun yoomiyyuu ta'uuf deemu.
He knows people well	Namoota akka gaariitti beeka
I don't think you are.	Ati akkas natti hin fakkaattu.
It would have been easier.	Silaa salphaa ta'a.
You have nothing to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabdu hin qabdu.
I can see it there	Achitti arguu nan danda'a
I hope it helps you.	Akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I didn't understand what he was saying	Waan inni jedhu naaf hin galle
It does work.	Ni hojjeta.
Look at that house.	Mana sana ilaalaa.
I can't leave her here	Asitti ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u
I said we just have to give this money	Maallaqa kana kennuu qofa qabna jedheen
I hadn’t thought of that.	Ani akkas hin yaadne ture.
He did it today.	Har'a ni godhe.
I think he knew he didn’t have a long life	Jireenya yeroo dheeraa akka hin qabne waan beeku natti fakkaata
you can’t have it.	qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
I want to know exactly what happened	Waan ta'e sirriitti beekuu barbaada
We are going to help you.	Isin gargaaruuf jirra.
But he couldn't go.	Garuu deemuu hin dandeenye.
I can't do this without you.	Si malee kana gochuu hin danda'u.
I am not one.	Ani tokko miti.
He works for his father.	Abbaa isaaf hojjeta.
I wanted to believe him	Isa amanuu barbaade
They look good, they feel good, and everyone loves them.	Gaarii fakkaatu, miira gaarii qabu, namni hundi isaan jaallata.
He may get nothing out of it.	Homaa irraa argachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
That could have been a bad idea.	Sun yaada hamaa taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
He just really, really doesn’t care.	Inni dhuguma, dhuguma dhimma hin qabu qofa.
I had no idea who she was	Eenyu akka taate yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
It just goes like this.	Akkasitti qofa deema.
He couldn't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin dandeenye.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
I didn’t know what to think	Maal akka yaadu hin beeku ture
I am that person.	Ani nama sana.
Another one a year later	Waggaa tokko booda kan biraa
I didn't know things could be so bad	Wanti akkas hamaa ta'uu akka danda'u hin beeku ture
She said sorry again.	Dhiifama jettee ammas.
This man is really going somewhere.	Namni kun dhuguma bakka tokko deemaa jira.
I think it sounds good	Sagalee gaarii qaba jedheen yaada
It should be this way.	Haala kana ta'uu qaba.
I know he told you that, but it wasn’t true	Akkas akka sitti hime nan beeka, garuu dhugaa hin turre
Names of children.	Maqaa ijoollee.
But most importantly, it has to be larger than life.	Garuu hunda caalaa jireenya caalaa guddaa ta'uu qaba.
He still wanted him, he wanted him	Ammas isa barbaada ture, isa barbaada ture
He should have stayed with her	Silaa ishee bira turuu qaba ture
I hoped it wasn't too big	Baay'ee guddaa akka hin taane abdiin qaba ture
He knew what we were.	Maal akka taane beeka ture.
These are good people.	Isaan kun namoota gaarii dha.
You can't hold it.	Qabduu hin dandeessu.
I don’t want any obligations for you.	Dirqama tokkollee siif hin barbaadu.
I don’t have any money anymore	Kana booda qarshii hin qabu
I have to go back to my house	Mana kootti deebi'uu qaba
This time from the wife.	Yeroo kana haadha manaa irraa.
He has everything.	Waan hunda qaba.
Something no one else has worked on.	Waan namni biraa irratti hin hojjenne.
That was enough for me	Kana naaf gahaa ture
Last night was pretty bad	Halkan darbe baayyee hamaa ture
You don’t mean them.	Isaan jechuu kee miti.
More, they work long hours.	Caalaatti, sa’aatii dheeraa hojjetu.
I know that you know.	Akka beektu nan beeka.
You’re working on yourself.	Of irratti hojjechaa jirta.
I hope that’s not the case with his daughter	Intala isaa akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba
I think about them all the time	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee isaanii nan yaada
You can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeessu.
It just can't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu akka hin dandeenye qofa.
To be that year again.	Ammas bara sana ta'uuf.
People are in danger.	Namoonni balaa keessa jiru.
All of his time.	Yeroo isaa hunda.
It can be great.	Guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
I was an adult.	Ani nama guddaa ture.
Sometimes even more than that.	Yeroo tokko tokko sanaa ol illee.
I thought we had something	Waan tokko qabna jedheen yaade
Things looked perfectly fine.	Wanti jiru guutummaatti gaarii fakkaata ture.
There really is.	Dhuguma jira.
I think it’s great and all that	Guddaa fi kana hunda natti fakkaata
But she didn't look like herself.	Isheen garuu of hin fakkaattu turte.
I have no answer at that time.	Yeroo sanatti deebii hin qabu.
Please look at my picture.	Mee suuraa koo ilaalaa.
I would never think of going anywhere else.	Bakka biraa deemuuf gonkumaa hin yaadu ture.
is he you? 	inni ati?
I saw nothing about that	Waa'ee sanaa homaa hin argine
Yet.	Ammallee.
I could never do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I didn’t see them coming	Isaan dhufuu isaanii hin argine
Now, not so much.	Amma, hangas miti.
I just can't do anything here.	Asitti homaa gochuu qofa hin danda'u.
I don’t mean to come across like that to you	Ani akkasitti sitti dhufuu jechuu koo miti
They should have seen it.	Silaa arguu qabu turan.
I think he was great in the situation	Haala keessa guddaa ture natti fakkaata
This was a bad night.	Halkan kun halkan hamaa ture.
I should know better, of course	Kana caalaa beekuu qaba, beekamaadha
But one person knows.	Namni tokko garuu ni beeka.
There is still time, and there is still hope.	Ammas yeroon jira, ammas abdiin jira.
Both times around the house.	Yeroo lamaan naannoo manaa.
This isn’t exactly my favorite sound.	Kun sirriitti sagalee ani jaalladhu miti.
Sometimes I have them	Yeroo tokko tokko isaan qaba
No one is around tonight.	Halkan kana namni naannoo hin jiru.
So easy for me.	Kanaaf salphaa naaf.
I want to know what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e beekuu barbaada.
I couldn’t stop thinking	Yaadu dhiisuu hin dandeenye
She was working outside.	Isheen ala hojjechaa turte.
I think you can see this is true	Kun dhugaa ta'uu isaa arguu dandeessu jedheen yaada
And I just said it.	Anis jedheen qofa.
But now that doesn’t matter.	Amma garuu sun homaa hin qabu.
But everyone is different.	Garuu namni hundi adda adda.
It would never have been great.	Silaa gonkumaa guddaa hin ta'u ture.
I don't know why that happened.	Maaliif akkas ta'e hin beeku.
I didn’t know you had it in you	Si keessa akka qabdu hin beeku ture
It was easy, but it took time.	Salphaa ture, garuu yeroo fudhate.
I couldn’t believe this.	Kana amanuu hin dandeenye.
I really hope something comes of it.	Dhuguma waan tokko akka irraa dhufu abdiin qaba.
Just out of her room	Kutaa ishee keessaa ba'e qofa
I think we have something new	Waan haaraa qabna jedheen yaada
I want you to know everything	Waan hundumaa akka beektu nan barbaada
We’re only human, you know.	Nuti nama qofa, beektaa.
This is not an easy thing.	Kun waan salphaa miti.
He may be a little older, but that's it	Xiqqoo umuriin isaa guddaa ta'uu danda'a, garuu kanuma
He could have made me come to him.	Silaa gara isaa akkan dhufu gochuu danda'a ture.
I just need one thing.	Waan tokko qofa na barbaachisa.
Something is going on right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana wanti tokko tokko deemaa jira.
He never does much else.	Waan biraa baay'ee gonkumaa hin hojjetu.
I can't say that.	Ani akkas jechuu hin danda'u.
He was the only one.	Inni qofa ture.
I couldn't do anything.	Waan tokko gochuu hin dandeenye.
I love that about you	Waa'ee kee sana baay'een jaalladha
That’s what always works.	Yeroo hunda kan hojjetu kanuma.
I don't want anything.	Ani homaa hin barbaadu.
Maybe it was nothing.	Tarii homaa hin turre ta'a.
A little bit of everything	Xiqqoo waan hundumaa
I didn't want that to happen to my wife	Haadha manaa koo irratti akkas akka ta'u hin barbaanne
This was very, very bad.	Kun baayyee baayyee hamaa ture.
I had no idea what he was on about	Waa'ee maal irratti akka ture yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I didn't want to be completely alone	Guutummaatti kophaa ta'uu hin barbaanne
Where you can help a lot there, you know.	Bakka ati baay'ee gargaaruu dandeessu achitti, beekta.
I wanted to be with my wife	Haadha manaa koo wajjin taʼuu nan barbaade
But many do.	Baay'een garuu ni godhu.
I thought it was pretty good	Baayyee gaarii natti fakkaate
Then I saw nothing	Sana booda homaa hin argine
That was two years ago.	Sana waggaa lama dura.
All of us.	Hundi keenya.
That wasn’t exactly true.	Sun sirriitti dhugaa hin turre.
Except this time it will be different.	Yeroo kana malee adda ta'a.
She was nothing.	Ishee homaa hin turre.
That seems to work.	Sun waan hojjetu fakkaata.
That may be appropriate.	Sun sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
Where was he now?.	Amma eessa ture?.
The one you have right now.	Kan yeroo ammaa qabdu.
I had to be wrong.	Ani dogoggora ta'uu qaba ture.
I couldn't see her much	Baay'ee ishee arguu hin dandeenye
I told him there was no need for that	Sana akka hin barbaachifne itti hime
You have your time and money.	Yeroo fi qarshii kee qabda.
He just loved to play	Inni taphachuu qofa jaallata ture
Many of them knew.	Baay'een isaanii ni beeku turan.
You always have ideas.	Yaada yeroo hunda qabda.
I always liked my home.	Yeroo hundumaa mana koo natti tola ture.
What he was looking for, he didn’t know.	Waan inni barbaadaa ture, hin beeku ture.
I didn't know about her	Waa'ee ishee hin beeku ture
It worked very well.	Baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjete.
Not much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay'ee miti.
I just need to be a little higher	Xiqqoo ol ta'uu qofa na barbaachisa
They do a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjetu.
I can't go back that far	Hanga sana duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u
Maybe I can do something for you.	Tarii waan tokko siif gochuu danda'a.
I thought it was great	Guddaa natti fakkaate
Love this car.	Konkolaataa kana jaalladhu.
It was all one piece.	Hundi isaa kutaa tokko ture.
I knew this feeling so well	Miira kana akkasitti nan beeka ture
Tomorrow there again.	Boru ammas achitti.
Boy you have a lot of people here.	Gurbaa as namoota baay'ee qabda.
Then it was easy.	Sana booda salphaa ture.
I wasn't sure it would ever happen.	Yoomiyyuu akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
That sounded more like him.	Sun caalaatti isa fakkaata ture.
Not everyone got everything.	Namni hundi waan hunda argachuu hin dandeenye.
I will always love you	Yeroo hundumaa si jaalladha
It's just so bad.	Akka malee hamaa qofa.
Maybe you're not.	Tarii ati hin taane ta'a.
Just like she has.	Akkuma isheen qabdu.
I still love so much about him.	Ammas waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee jaalladha.
He took it from them.	Isaan irraa fudhate.
I want to go there.	Achi deemuu barbaada.
I wanted to be with my mom	Haadha koo waliin ta'uu barbaade
I would go no further	Ani kana caalaa hin deemu ture
All that hope.	Abdii sana hunda.
While she was.	Osoo isheen.
No one said anything.	Namni homaa dubbate hin jiru.
We didn't have a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee hin qabnu turre.
But hopefully not much more.	Garuu kana caalaa baay'ee akka hin taane abdii qabna.
It wouldn’t have mattered then	Silaa yeroo sanatti dhimma hin qabu ture
He must come.	Inni dhufuu qaba.
I don't know the date.	Guyyaa isaa hin beeku.
You have to be.	Ta'uu qabda.
I think I would have.	Silaa jedheen yaada.
I don't know what happened there, but something.	Achitti maaltu akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu waan tokko.
I would like your opinion on that.	Sana irratti yaada keessan barbaada.
And I was almost certain	Anis mirkanaa'aa ture jechuun ni danda'ama
She was extremely accurate.	Garmalee sirrii turte.
Is there anything new?.	Waan haaraa jiraa?.
Just too many people.	Namoonni baay'ee qofa.
He just goes away.	Inni qofa deema.
He doesn't know any of it.	Inni tokkollee hin beeku.
He did it for me.	Inni naaf godhe.
I know what you’ve been doing	Waan ati hojjechaa turte nan beeka
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
I hadn’t noticed it yet	Hanga ammaatti hin hubanne ture
But he didn't.	Garuu hin goone.
You don't know them.	Isaan hin beektu.
I hope it happens soon	Yeroo dhiyootti akka ta'u abdiin qaba
That's right.	Sun sirrii dha.
It’s not long now.	Amma dheeraa miti.
But I never know.	Ani garuu gonkumaa hin beeku.
You don't have to do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin qabdu.
I couldn’t tell myself	Ofitti himuu hin dandeenye
I know him very well	Baay'ee isa beeka
I wasn't sure you could do it	Akka ati gochuu dandeessu mirkanaa'aa hin turre
So I was very happy	Kanaaf baay'een gammade
I didn’t think anyone knew	Namni waan beeku natti hin fakkaatu ture
I need food.	Nyaata na barbaachisa.
I know you can do it well	Akka gaariitti gochuu akka dandeessu nan beeka
I didn’t know what else to say	Kan biraa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture
It was a great day.	Guyyaa guddaa ture.
I hoped she liked it	Akka isheen jaallattu abdiin qaba ture
I didn’t know why she didn’t just tell the truth	Maaliif dhugaa qofa akka hin dubbanne hin beeku ture
I don't mean that	Ani akkas jechuu koo miti
Everything like.	Waan hunda akka.
You are looking for the truth.	Dhugaa barbaadaa jirta.
I don't mean that	Akkas jechuu koo miti
Not sure you know what that is right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sun maal akka ta'e akka beektu mirkanaa'aa miti.
This would not work.	Kun hin hojjetu ture.
There were a lot of people.	Namoonni baay'een turan.
We have almost everything.	Waan hundumaa qabna jechuun ni danda’ama.
Maybe we need time outside.	Tarii yeroo ala nu barbaachisa ta'a.
Many.	Hedduu.
I’ve been waiting for you for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf si eegaa ture
We don’t do it.	Nuti hin goonu.
I say just go for it	Anis itti qofa deemaa jedha
This was a good one.	Kun gaarii ture.
Not sure of the girl's name	Maqaa intala kanaa mirkanaa'aa miti
You can just do your best.	Waan dandeessu hunda qofa hojjechuu dandeessa.
Look at that.	Sana ilaalaa.
But he would do it.	Garuu ni godha ture.
I need him so much.	Baay'ee isa barbaada.
But it still looks good.	Garuu ammas waan gaarii fakkaata.
But one has to go further.	Garuu namni tokko kana caalaa deemuu qaba.
It wasn’t very big.	Baayyee guddaa hin turre.
I'm not saying it can't happen	Ta'uu hin danda'u jechuu koo miti
I didn’t know where we could go	Eessa deemuu akka dandeenyu hin beeku ture
Maybe it's at mine.	Tarii kan koo bira jira ta'a.
He was about to be two.	Inni lama ta'uuf jedha ture.
I could always tell him the truth	Yeroo hundumaa dhugaa jiru itti himuu nan dandaʼa ture
I wish it was just that simple	Osoo akkas salphaa qofa ta'ee natti tola
This was going to be her home now.	Kun amma mana ishee ta'uuf ture.
You just couldn’t see it.	Ati qofa arguu hin dandeenye.
We don’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qabnu.
I used to be able to do that	Duraan akkas gochuu nan danda'a ture
I haven’t spoken to him yet	Hanga ammaatti isa waliin hin dubbanne
If we want it, we can’t get it.	Yoo barbaanne argachuu hin dandeenyu.
He realized he had made a mistake	Dogoggora akka hojjete hubate
I already know who this is	Kun eenyu akka ta'e duruu beeka
I want to do more than that.	Sana caalaa hojjechuu barbaada.
No one had ever reacted like that before.	Kanaan dura namni akkasitti deebii kenne hin beeku.
I didn’t know how to tell him	Akkamitti akkan itti himu hin beeku ture
He should have been in the car	Silaa konkolaataa sana keessa jiraachuu qaba ture
I think he just needs time.	Yeroo qofa isa barbaachisa jedheen yaada.
It’s still in the same old place.	Ammallee bakka durii sana keessa jira.
In the present tense.	Yeroo ammaa keessatti.
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
But he had a drink.	Garuu dhugaatii qaba ture.
Morning.	Ganama.
He will be in the crowd.	Inni namoota baay'ee keessa ta'a.
He came to me.	Gara koo dhufe.
Everything is about you, and what you think you want.	Wanti hundi waa'ee kee, fi waan ati barbaaddu sitti fakkaata.
I didn’t recognize the car.	Konkolaataa sana hin beekne.
But they are not.	Isaan garuu miti.
It was a real moment.	Yeroon sun yeroo dhugaa ture.
Time and place.	Yeroo fi bakka.
He doesn’t seem to understand us at all.	Inni tasumaa waan nu hubate hin fakkaatu.
It’s not clear what it does.	Maal akka hojjetu ifa miti.
You should know that as well as you know everything else about me.	Waa'ee koo waan biraa hundumaa akkuma beektu sana beekuu qabda.
That’s your problem.	Rakkoon kee kanuma.
But sometimes you really need it.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko dhuguma si barbaachisa.
And I told him so.	Anis akkas itti hime.
I didn't realize that	Akkas akka ta'e hin hubanne
I did it to help you	Si gargaaruuf jedheen godhe
What happened should not have happened.	Wanti ta'e ta'uu hin qabu ture.
But most of the time he's really right.	Garuu yeroo baay'ee dhuguma sirrii dha.
But it is a must.	Garuu dirqama.
I already knew he thought he loved me	Na jaallatu akka itti fakkaate duruu beeka ture
I went along with it.	Anis waliin deeme.
I told him who was going	Eenyu akka deemu itti hime
I used to love his ideas	Duraan yaada isaa baay'een jaalladha ture
I thought I was better off that way	Akkasitti naaf wayya jedheen yaade
I even thought they were friends	Hiriyyoota illee natti fakkaate
I won't go without you	Si malee hin deemu
Try it today!.	Har'a yaalaa!.
I was expecting you sooner than tomorrow	Boru caalaa dafee si eegaa ture
It would have been.	Silaa ta'a ture.
It’s not that bad.	Hamma kana hamaa miti.
He is never wrong.	Inni gonkumaa dogoggora hin qabu.
I think it looks good on you	Sitti gaarii fakkaata jedheen yaada
They were now.	Isaan amma turan.
It’s not for us.	Nuuf miti.
i love it so much.	baay'een jaalladha.
You can do it well.	Akka gaariitti hojjechuu dandeessa.
Look at me.	Na ilaalaa.
Now it was the only job he was there for.	Amma hojii inni achi ture qofa ture.
I didn't think so.	Ani hin yaadne.
But I would never do it.	Ani garuu gonkumaa hin godhu ture.
I have a couple of ideas as to what it could be	Maal ta'uu akka danda'u yaada tokko lama qaba
I was having a lot of problems with her	Rakkoo hedduu ishee waliin qabaa ture
I never have it.	Ani gonkumaa hin qabu.
A small amount perhaps	Hamma xiqqoo tarii
I know better than you	Si caalaa nan beeka
I know you can do it	Akka ati gochuu dandeessu nan beeka
I think that was a mistake	Sun dogoggora ture jedheen yaada
No one is coming after me.	Namni na booda dhufu hin jiru.
I didn’t understand it at the time	Yeroo sana naaf hin galle
You have to believe it.	Amanuu qabda.
This is my house.	Kun mana kooti.
It was good but different.	Gaarii ture garuu adda ture.
Sometimes something in their lives.	Yeroo tokko tokko jireenya isaanii keessatti waan tokko.
I didn’t really know anyone that well	Dhuguma nama akkas sirriitti hin beeku ture
I just said I went with you	Si waliin deeme jedheen qofa
I wondered what he was doing	Maal hojjechaa jira jedheen yaade
He told you he still loved you, he just couldn’t stay here.	Ammallee akka si jaallatu sitti hime, as turuu qofa hin dandeenye.
I thought that would never happen	Sun gonkumaa hin ta'u jedheen yaade
He just does his job.	Hojii isaa qofa hojjeta.
Everything was bad	Wanti hundi hamaa ture
You must go.	Ati deemuun dirqama.
I want to tell you.	Himuu barbaada.
I thought about her often	Yeroo baayʼee waaʼee ishee nan yaada ture
But that can’t be the case.	Garuu sun ta’uu hin danda’u.
They are watching us.	Nu ilaalaa jiru.
But not much.	Garuu baay'ee miti.
I can't answer right now	Yeroo ammaa kana deebii kennuu hin danda'u
But you are different.	Ati garuu adda.
He saw everything	Waan hunda arge
The one we have now.	Kan amma qabnu.
Many people do, but this is not the case.	Namoonni baay'een ni godhu, garuu kun akkas miti.
You really have to believe you can have one.	Dhuguma tokko qabaachuu akka dandeessu amanuu qabda.
It was clear she wanted to say something else.	Waan biraa dubbachuu akka barbaaddu ifa ture.
He didn't have long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin qabu ture.
They love this.	Kana ni jaallatu.
He wants that.	Sana barbaada.
This time the real one.	Yeroo kana kan dhugaa.
And that’s not all.	Kana qofa miti.
But he didn't know why	Maaliif akka ta'e garuu hin beeku ture
Now I wasn't sure.	Amma mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
He had nothing in his hands.	Harka isaa keessaa homaa hin qabu ture.
I can get it for you later	Booda siif argachuu nan danda'a
But he is watching her.	Garuu ishee ilaalaa jira.
If you haven't seen it, check it out.	Yoo hin argine ta'e ilaalaa.
I will definitely do this again	Ammas kana gochuun koo hin oolu
I can never live with myself	Yoomiyyuu ofii koo waliin jiraachuu hin danda'u
That certainly didn’t go over well.	Sun akka gaariitti akka hin deemne beekamaadha.
I'm still not sure just how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e qofa ammallee hin beeku.
He knew he had to say something more.	Kana caalaa waan tokko dubbachuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
All of this matters.	Kun hundi dhimma qaba.
I have to go quickly	Dafee deemuun qaba
I hadn't thought about that	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne ture
No one else would have told me that.	Silaa namni biraa akkas natti himu hin jiru.
A wife, of all things	Haadha manaa, kan waan hundumaa
I know the area well.	Naannoo sana sirriitti beeka.
I saw you this afternoon	Har'a waaree booda si arge
I know you’re not here tonight	Halkan kana as akka hin jirre nan beeka
But it has to be right.	Garuu sirrii ta'uu qaba.
You have to do more than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qabda.
He was there with them	Isaan waliin achi ture
But she said nothing to help.	Isheen garuu gargaaruuf homaa hin dubbanne.
I mean, not everyone but me	Ana malee nama hunda miti jechuu kooti
I wanted to be like them.	Anis akka isaanii ta'uu barbaade.
I'm in this.	Ani kana keessa jira.
They should be loud.	Sagalee guddaa qabaachuu qabu.
But this was a different time.	Garuu yeroon kun yeroo adda ture.
He thought he could.	Ni danda'a jedhee yaade.
I haven’t been with anyone in a while	Yeroo muraasaaf nama waliin hin turre
I know exactly what happens here	Asitti maaltu akka ta'u sirriitti beeka
He probably even responded.	Deebii illee kennuu hin oolu.
That’s just dangerous.	Sun balaa qofa qaba.
I have no other questions.	Gaaffii biraa hin qabu.
It should have come to me earlier.	Silaa kanaan dura natti dhufuu qaba ture.
That requires feedback.	Sun yaada deebii barbaada.
I know you will never know	Yoomiyyuu akka hin beekne nan beeka
But I don’t think she’s a threat.	Garuu isheen balaa natti hin fakkaatu.
But he didn't see her.	Garuu ishee hin argine.
Glad to see you again	Ammas si arguu kootti gammadeera
This is where it had to be.	Bakka kana ta'uu qaba ture.
I can't believe what just happened	Waan amma ta'e amanuu hin danda'u
You can still do it.	Ammas ni dandeessa.
I can't see it.	Arguu hin danda'u.
He was looking at him.	Isa ilaalaa ture.
It used to be like that.	Duraan akkas ture.
I have a lot of money	Maallaqa baay'een qaba
I didn’t want everyone from school to know	Mana barumsaa irraa namni hundi akka beeku hin barbaanne
I think one thing is absolutely clear.	Wanti tokko guutummaatti ifa natti fakkaata.
I had better do that now	Amma akkas gochuun naaf wayya ture
I would never do that	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture
I didn’t want him to leave	Akka inni biraa deemu hin barbaanne
That’s what it means.	Kana jechuun kanuma.
I know your voice	Sagalee kee nan beeka
I can do good things	Waan gaarii hojjechuu nan dandaʼa
But she had it.	Garuu qabdi turte.
That's what happened with my mother.	Haadha koo waliin ta'e kanuma.
It was very good.	Baayyee gaarii ture.
There will be another soon.	Kan biraa yeroo dhiyootti ni jiraata.
She didn’t quite know how to handle this.	Kana akkamitti akka qabdu sirriitti hin beektu turte.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
Before her two men.	Namoota ishee lamaan dura.
There is no place for anything.	Wanti bakka hin qabu.
This was a highlight of my life	Kun jireenya koo keessatti wanta adda taʼe ture
I can get a job, if necessary	Hojii argachuu nan danda'a, yoo barbaachisaa ta'e
I looked just like her	Anis akkuma ishee fakkaata ture
I haven’t seen you around in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf naannoo si hin argine.
I just wanted to know if you knew that guy.	Gurbaa sana beektu ta'uu kee qofa beekuu barbaade.
I’m not going to help.	Gargaaruuf hin deemu.
It’s not this one.	Isa kana miti.
That’s the only possibility.	Carraan isaa kanuma qofa.
He knew that feeling all too well	Miira sana sirriitti beeka ture
Not a good fact.	Dhugaa gaarii miti.
Otherwise, you have no idea.	Yoo kana hin taane garuu yaada hin qabdu.
I don't mean that.	Kana jechuu koo miti.
I really didn’t need that right now	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kana sun na hin barbaachifne
Glad to see you	Si arguu kootti gammadeera
There was nothing else like it out there.	Wanti akkasii ala jiru biraa hin turre.
I'm good at that.	Ani sana irratti ga'umsa qaba.
It was really really good.	Dhuguma dhuguma gaarii ture.
It’s just not that simple .	Akkas salphaa miti qofa .
If so, he made a terrible mistake.	Yoo akkas ta'e dogoggora hamaa hojjete.
He didn’t have time for that	Kanaaf yeroo hin qabu ture
It’s really in it.	Dhuguma keessa jira.
I can do that from here	Sana as irraa gochuu nan danda'a
I think it is possible.	Ni danda'ama jedheen yaada.
This time, it was so bad.	Yeroo kana, akka malee hamaa ture.
I couldn’t believe his thoughts	Yaada isaa amanuu hin dandeenye
I was once one of those people.	Ani yeroo tokko namoota sana keessaa tokko ture.
Maybe she's the one.	Tarii isheen ta'uu danda'a.
Sounds like a good idea.	Yaada gaarii fakkaata.
It seemed completely authentic.	Guutummaatti dhugaa fakkaata ture.
A new life perhaps	Jireenya haaraa tarii
I had no idea much about it	Waa'ee waan kanaa baay'ee yaada hin qabu ture
Everything is different now	Amma wanti hundi adda
I can see that in you.	Sana si keessatti arguu nan danda'a.
This isn't going to happen.	Kun hin ta'u.
I wasn't sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Most of the time it was good for me.	Yeroo baay'ee naaf gaarii ture.
I think we got along well	Akka gaariitti walii galle jedheen yaada
Tell him that.	Akkas itti himi.
I really enjoyed the day.	Guyyaa sana baay'een gammade.
He sought them out there.	Achitti isaan barbaade.
You have to walk on it.	Irra deemuu qabda.
It was late in the afternoon.	Yeroon isaa waaree booda ture.
I was sure he was there.	Achi akka jiru mirkanaa'aa ture.
Man has everything he needs	Namni waan isa barbaachisu hunda qaba
I know you haven’t done anything	Homaa akka hin goone nan beeka
I go during the week.	Torban keessa nan deema.
A very large amount of money	Maallaqa baayyee guddaa
Later in the day.	Booda guyyaa keessa.
I know how much it is.	Meeqa akka ta'e nan beeka.
Now I certainly think	Amma akkan yaadu beekamaadha
That was the only job he could find.	Hojiin inni argachuu dandaʼu kanuma qofa ture.
But, we didn’t.	Garuu, nuti hin taane.
I did it again.	Ammas nan godhe.
I can't get the facts	Dhugaa jiru argachuu hin danda'u
She was something.	Isheen waan tokko turte.
It must be my father.	Abbaa koo ta'uu qaba.
It stayed in place for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf bakka isaa ture.
I was a bit much	Xiqqoo baay'een ture
They didn’t understand.	Isaan hin hubanne.
That might be my parents.	Sun tarii warra koo ta'uu danda'a.
Only time will tell.	Yeroon kan himu qofa.
Not the best, not the worst.	Kan gaarii miti, isa hamaa miti.
It can even be dangerous.	Balaa illee taʼuu dandaʼa.
I think people should buy their own books	Namoonni kitaaba ofii bitachuu qabu jedheen yaada
There was no need for that.	Sana hin barbaachisu ture.
I like it a lot more now	Amma baay'ee natti tola
This time things are different.	Yeroo kana wanti adda ta'a.
No one did anything.	Namni waan tokko hojjete hin jiru.
I didn’t meet her eyes.	Ija ishee waliin wal hin argine.
So, we told them who we were.	Kanaaf, eenyu akka taane itti himne.
I'm sure it helps	Akka gargaaru mirkanaa'adha
I still have no answer.	Ammas deebii hin qabu.
You need to tell me more.	Kana caalaa natti himuu qabda.
That's all.	Kana qofa.
You have, you know, totally how it works.	Ati qabda, beekta, guutummaatti akkamitti akka hojjetu.
There is still time.	Ammallee yeroon jira.
It really does work.	Dhuguma ni hojjeta.
Today.	Har'a.
One would be wrong.	Tokko dogoggora ta'a.
They knew me.	Isaan na beeku turan.
Look at what's happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru ilaalaa.
I couldn’t live with myself	Of waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye
I want to be just like you.	Anis akkuma kee ta'uu barbaada.
I had them both in my house	Isaan lamaan mana koo keessa qaba ture
Man wants to.	Namni barbaada.
I really don’t understand	Dhuguma naaf hin galle
We were alone.	Kophaa keenya turre.
I rarely had any idea what to say	Waan jedhu yaada tokkollee yeroo muraasaaf qaba ture
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
I hope we can get the full version tomorrow!	Boru guutuu isaa argachuu akka dandeenyu abdiin qaba!
Maybe it's you.	Tarii si ta'uu danda'a.
But no one asked him.	Garuu namni isa gaafate hin turre.
That’s all I need to go work on	Kana qofa irratti hojjechuuf deemuu qaba
People can play those.	Namoonni warra sana taphachuu danda'u.
It was clear that this was my life now.	Kun amma jireenya koo akka ta'e ifa ture.
You don’t need to.	Ati hin barbaachisu.
But I only have one.	Garuu tokko qofa qaba.
Even better than she was now.	Isheen amma turte caalaa illee.
Look at me.	Na ilaalaa.
Lots of work but nice	Hojii baay'ee garuu namatti tola
We really had no idea what it meant.	Dhuguma maal jechuu akka taʼe yaada hin qabnu turre.
I didn’t know his name	Maqaa isaa hin beeku ture
He didn't say much now.	Amma baay'ee hin dubbanne.
From the eyes.	Ija irraa.
They were perfect.	Isaan guutuu turan.
He can give it to you.	Inni siif kennuu danda'a.
He thought of going but didn’t	Deemuuf yaade garuu hin deemne
That hope becomes clear.	Abdiin sun ifa ta'a.
I wasn't sure of anything.	Homaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
You are in a position to do something.	Waan tokko gochuuf haala keessa jirta.
I really don't know much about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee hin beeku.
I know what he wants	Waan inni barbaadu nan beeka
I knew he liked that	Akkas akka jaallatu nan beeka ture
Nowadays, it never seems to work.	Yeroo ammaa garuu gonkumaa waan hin hojjenne fakkaata.
Things may be different now.	Amma wanti jiru adda taʼuu dandaʼa.
I must have it.	Ani qabaachuu qaba.
He was on his way when he arrived	Yeroo inni dhufu karaa irra ture
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
I mainly said that in my comments	Irra caalaa yaada koo irratti akkas jedheen ture
It just started for him.	Isaaf qofa jalqabe.
It does the job.	Hojii ni hojjeta.
You should see this one!.	Isa kana arguu qabdu!.
I didn’t really have my hopes up	Dhuguma abdii koo ol hin qabu ture
The feeling of the moment, again.	Miira yeroo sanaa, ammas.
It could be me.	Ana ta'uu danda'a.
But he was working with them.	Garuu isaan waliin hojjechaa ture.
I don't have to tell him what he can do or where he can go.	Maal gochuu akka danda'u, eessa akka deemu himuu hin qabu.
Check out my comments.	Yaada koo ilaalaa.
I hope I never see him more.	Kana caalaa gonkumaa akkan isa hin argine abdiin qaba.
I had no idea what the moment was	Yeroon sun maal akka taʼe yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Maal hojjechuuf akka deeme hin beeku ture
I can't help it.	Ani gargaaruu hin danda'u.
I know what you said is true	Wanti ati jette dhugaa ta'uu nan beeka
Neither of us said anything for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf lamaan keenyayyuu homaa hin dubbanne.
You're not going.	Hin deemtu.
We didn’t have one.	Tokko hin qabnu turre.
It sounds like a lot of work.	Hojii guddaa fakkaata.
Sometimes things happen this way.	Yeroo tokko tokko wanti akkasitti taʼa.
I still have no sense.	Ammallee miira hin qabu.
They and you.	Isaanii fi isin.
He’s waiting for you in your room.	Kutaa kee keessa si eegaa jira.
There will be problems.	Rakkoon ni jiraata.
You should have known better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu qabda turte.
She was wrong.	Dogoggora turte.
You know what they were.	Maal akka turan ni beekta.
I knew you in your past life	Jireenya kee isa darbe keessatti si beeka ture
He is important.	Inni barbaachisaa dha.
It was still on, so everything was fine	Ammallee irra ture, kanaaf wanti hundi gaarii ture
I was perfectly fine alone	Kophaa koo guutummaatti gaarii ture
I really don’t understand.	Dhuguma naaf hin galle.
This is the most important idea.	Kun yaada hunda caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
I know you want them in your life	Jireenya kee keessatti akka isaan barbaaddu nan beeka
I think this could work better	Kun caalaatti hojjechuu danda'a jedheen yaada
I thought about you a lot	Waa'ee kee baay'een yaade
I want you to know this	Kana akka beektu nan barbaada
We don’t do that.	Nuti akkas hin goonu.
I couldn’t see anyone	Nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye
I don’t know where the problem is, everything seems fine.	Rakkoon jiru eessa akka jiru hin beeku, wanti hundi gaarii fakkaata.
I still want everything good.	Ammallee waan hundumaa gaarii barbaada.
That's right there.	Achitti sirrii dha.
This is an opportunity to do something.	Kun carraa waan tokko hojjechuuf ta’e.
I can't go right now	Yeroo ammaa kana deemuu hin danda'u
It’s just always there.	Yeroo hundumaa qofa jira.
They all seem like nice people.	Hundi isaanii namoota gaarii fakkaatu.
I certainly wasn’t that good	Ani akkas gaarii akkan hin turre beekamaadha
I know it's great.	Guddaa akka ta'e nan beeka.
I didn’t understand any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin hubanne.
Maybe she was right.	Tarii isheen sirrii turte ta'a.
But that’s never enough.	Garuu sun gonkumaa gahaa miti.
You have to be like that outside of work.	Hojiin ala akkas ta'uu qabda.
But they couldn’t say.	Garuu isaan jechuu hin dandeenye.
I never wanted anyone	Nama barbaadu gonkumaa hin barbaanne
It's just being true.	Dhugaa ta'uu qofa.
We must have done something right	Waan sirriitti hojjenne ta'uu qaba
But there was nothing.	Garuu wanti tokko hin turre.
I knew he was right	Sirrii akka taʼe nan beeka ture
I mean, somebody had to do it	Namni tokko gochuu qaba ture jechuu kooti
That wasn’t enough.	Sun gahaa hin turre.
A man with many names.	Nama maqaa hedduu qabu.
I couldn’t tell him the truth	Dhugaa jiru itti himuu hin dandeenye
But he wouldn’t do it.	Garuu hin godhu ture.
Not something I wanted to happen.	Waan tokko akka ta'u barbaade miti.
He really must be gone for a long time.	Dhuguma yeroo dheeraaf hin jiru ta'uu qaba.
I didn’t know what to do with myself.	Waan ofitti godhu hin beeku ture.
That’s not who we are.	Eenyu akka taane kanuma miti.
I knew better than to answer	Deebii kennuu caalaa nan beeka ture
We have a guy.	Gurbaa tokko qabna.
This one worked out.	Inni kun ni hojjete.
I will never have him.	Yoomiyyuu isa hin qabu.
I wanted to tell him, but my voice wouldn’t work	Itti himuu barbaade, garuu sagalee koo hin hojjetu ture
I have nothing to do with them	Ani isaan waliin homaa hin qabu
I could be wrong though	Ani garuu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a
I think it was a bit bigger than a car.	Konkolaataa caalaa xiqqoo guddaa ture jedheen yaada.
It requires a completely different mindset.	Yaada guutummaatti adda ta’e barbaada.
It was a problem of time.	Rakkoo yeroo ture.
I’m just doing my job	Ani hojii koo qofa hojjechaa jira
It doesn’t matter anymore	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu
I won’t tell you how to do it	Akkamitti akka gootu sitti hin himu
That's it.	Kana moo.
But this is not an issue.	Garuu kun dhimma miti.
Someone you love and care deeply about.	Nama ati baay'ee jaallattu fi itti yaaddu.
We just went to work.	Hojii qofa deemne.
I mean, you know, there were both of them.	Beektaa jechuu kooti, ​​isaan lamaan turan.
It seemed like nothing.	Waan hin taane fakkaata ture.
I want to know what he has to tell us.	Waan inni nutti himuu qabu beekuu barbaada.
She was all right.	Waan hundumaa sirriitti turte.
Everything will be so easy.	Wanti hundi akkasitti salphaa ta'a.
I don’t have any in my house anymore	Kana booda mana koo keessatti tokkollee hin qabu
I didn't think it was for this at all	Tasumaa kanaaf waan ta'e natti hin fakkaatu ture
Everything about them was wrong.	Waa'ee isaanii wanti hundi dogoggora ture.
I have only a little time to be with you	Yeroon si waliin ta'uuf qabu xiqqoo qofa
Not exactly new.	Sirriitti haaraa miti.
But it didn't work out very well.	Garuu baayyee gaarii hin taane.
I know what he’s going to do	Waan inni gochuuf jedhu nan beeka
But we don’t have this time.	Garuu yeroo kana hin qabnu.
You have to know Him.	Isa beekuu qabda.
I want to have my clothes though	Uffata koo garuu qabaachuu nan barbaada
But not with this.	Kana waliin garuu miti.
We need to be doing things right	Waan sirriitti hojjechaa jiraachuu qabna
Nothing could be clearer.	Kana caalaa wanti ifa ta’uu danda’u hin jiru.
He had no one else	Nama biraa hin qabu ture
Not unless someone else wants it.	Namni biraa yoo barbaade malee miti.
This would be good.	Kun gaarii ta'a.
If we can.	Yoo dandeenye.
I want to know why he left	Maaliif akka deeme beekuu barbaada
I wouldn’t go for it	Ani itti hin deemu ture
There was no one around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin turre.
He knew when the day and hour were.	Isaa yoom akka guyyaa fi sa'aatii beeka ture.
He may not and cannot be anything else.	Inni waan biraa ta’uu dhiisuu fi hin danda’u ta’a.
I can't ask for more	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin danda'u
I think they could do nothing but help us.	Nu gargaaruu malee homaa gochuu hin dandeenye natti fakkaata.
I’m going there right now	Yeroo ammaa kana achi deemaa jira
That's nothing, isn't it?.	Sun homaa mitii?.
That can never happen.	Sun gonkumaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
I don't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himu.
It wasn’t easy.	Waan salphaa hin turre.
Perhaps, too much.	Tarii, garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
This is right.	Kun sirrii dha.
Very, very nice.	Baayyee baayyee namatti tola.
I always knew when you were	Yeroo hundumaa yoom akka ati taate nan beeka ture
So you don't know what's in it.	Kanaaf waan keessa jiru hin beektu.
A little bit there.	Xiqqoo achitti.
I knew it was a problem	Rakkoo akka ta'e nan beeka ture
It’s always me.	Yeroo hundumaa ana.
Go home to yourself.	Ofitti gara manaatti deebi'i.
I didn’t know anything else.	Waan biraa hin beeku ture.
This is just such a person.	Kun nama akkasii qofa.
They were everywhere.	Bakka hunda turan.
They were waiting for me.	Na eegaa turan.
That's how she was.	Akkas turte.
I know you can and will if you have to	Yoo dirqama ta'e akka dandeessu fi akka gootu nan beeka
I'll go my own way.	Karaa koo nan deema.
It was after them.	Isaan booda ture.
Maybe it's right.	Tarii sirrii dha.
I have no idea what he’s doing there	Achitti maal akka hojjetu yaada hin qabu
It had taken a little while though.	Yeroo xiqqoo fudhate ture garuu.
But nothing worked.	Garuu wanti hojjete hin jiru.
We don’t have it.	Nuti qabna miti.
Everything was really good.	Dhuguma wanti hundi gaarii ture.
The right one.	Kan sirrii ta'e.
It was just in him.	Isa keessa qofa ture.
I think you still have it	Ammallee waan qabdu natti fakkaata
I wouldn’t want you to.	Ani akka ati gootu hin barbaadu ture.
That seemed ominous.	Sun waan hamaa fakkaata ture.
I couldn’t meet his eyes	Ija isaa waliin wal arguu hin dandeenye
I thought maybe .	Tarii jedheen yaade .
That wasn’t right out there tonight.	Sun halkan kana achi keessaa sirrii hin turre.
That's how I'm looking at it.	Akkasitti ilaalaa jira.
I doubt we will	Akka goonu nan shakka
They should be clear within an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko keessatti ifa ta'uu qabu.
No way, it won't happen.	Karaa hin qabu, hin ta'u.
This just happened last week.	Kun torban darbe qofa ta'e.
He didn’t have any parts	Kutaa tokkollee hin qabu ture
I really love you	Dhuguma si jaalladha
I mean, we obviously have nothing in common	Waan wal fakkaatu akka hin qabne ifaadha jechuu kooti
I still hadn't even thought about it	Ammallee waa'ee isaa illee hin yaadne ture
I have a lot of money	Maallaqa baay'een qaba
But she had no money for him.	Garuu qarshii isaaf hin qabdu turte.
She had an idea.	Yaada qabdi turte.
He didn't speak very often	Yeroo baay'ee hin dubbanne
I was really alone now	Dhuguma amma kophaa koo ture
I don’t have it.	Ani hin qabu.
It is not clear what this means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta’e ifa miti.
But now he knew better.	Garuu amma caalaatti beeka ture.
It's just like that.	Akkas qofa.
I would love some of your comments	Yaada keessan tokko tokko baay'een jaalladha
You don't know how I feel about it.	Miira ani waa'ee kanaa qabu hin beektu.
A little more, perhaps.	Xiqqoo caalaa, tarii.
I never wanted to be with him.	Isa waliin ta'uu gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
One little thing can go a long way	Wanti xiqqoo tokko karaa dheeraa deemuu danda'a
Bad times.	Yeroo hamaa.
I told him what had happened	Waan ta'e itti hime
I really wanted to be	Ta'uu baay'een barbaade
Like the one tonight.	Akkuma isa halkan kanaa.
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I have to admit it looks good	Gaarii akka fakkaatu amanuu qaba
I couldn’t stay here now.	Amma as turuu hin dandeenye.
I knew it was coming	Akka dhufu nan beeka ture
He’s not looking at her.	Inni ishee ilaalaa hin jiru.
I’m not there already	Ani amma dura achi hin jiru
You never want to say, you know, that this is it.	Ati gonkumaa jechuu hin barbaaddu, beekta, kana akka ta’e.
I wonder what we’re doing tonight	Halkan kana maal gochaa jirra jedheen yaada
I mean, it’s not funny.	Qoosaa miti jechuu kooti.
Like, later on.	Akkuma, yeroo booda.
They should have known that.	Silaa sana beekuu qabu turan.
She had to make it happen.	Akka ta'u gochuu qabdi turte.
Not everyone wants to do that.	Namni hundi akkas gochuu hin barbaadu.
Maybe it's the dog.	Tarii saree sana ta'uu danda'a.
That, it happens.	Kan, ta'a.
Nothing more, really.	Kana caalaa homaa hin jiru, dhuguma.
Good guy, good guy	Gurbaa gaarii, gurbaa gaarii
We need to do this now.	Kana amma gochuu qabna.
You are all there.	Hundi keessan jirta.
available.	jira.
I didn’t want anyone else	Nama biraa hin barbaanne
That’s all working fine.	Sun hundi gaarii hojjechaa jira.
Work.	Hojii.
I don't want one to be you	Tokko akka si ta'u hin barbaadu
But it was from that.	Garuu sana irraa ture.
I knew he would love it	Akka inni jaallatu nan beeka ture
I know him, I know myself with him	Ani isa beeka, isa waliin of beeka
It’s dangerous for us to think that way.	Akkas ta’ee yoo yaadne balaa nuuf ta’a.
But the timing wasn’t right.	Garuu yeroon isaa sirrii hin turre.
Now you are an adult.	Amma nama guddaa taate.
I have high hopes though	Abdii guddaa qaba garuu
I didn't say anything else to him.	Waan biraa itti hin dubbanne.
I wonder how people can live like this	Namoonni akkamitti akkas jiraachuu danda'u jedheen yaada
He had none of the nothing	Homaa keessaa tokko hin qabu ture
That's all.	Kana qofa.
I don't know who did it.	Eenyu akka godhe hin beeku.
But we have some new questions because of it.	Garuu sababa isaatiin gaaffii haaraa tokko tokko qabna.
I saw her.	Ani ishee arge.
Night and day really.	Halkan fi guyyaa dhuguma.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
I didn't know him	Ani isa hin beekne
But pretty much the same idea.	Garuu baay'ee yaada wal fakkaatu.
But we need two things.	Garuu waan lama nu barbaachisa.
I didn't think it would happen	Ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne
I wasn't sure you were right	Dhugaa ta'uu kee mirkanaa'aa hin turre
I couldn’t leave that out	Sana dhiisuu hin dandeenye
No one would have known.	Silaa namni beeku hin jiru.
You are me.	Ati ana.
I can tell you what that was.	Sun maal akka ture sitti himuu nan danda'a.
It wasn’t just a picture.	Suuraa qofa hin turre.
She has no one.	Nama hin qabdu.
But sometimes it happens.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko ni ta'a.
It would have been great.	Silaa guddaa ture.
Day in and day out.	Guyyaa keessaa fi guyyaa keessaa.
I love this place so much!	Bakka kana baay'een jaalladha!
We need to make this happen.	Kana akka ta'u gochuu qabna.
Of course, that never happens.	Sun gonkumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu homaa hin qabu.
I have no idea what to do now	Amma maal akkan godhu yaada hin qabu
I don’t think you can do that.	Akkas gochuu waan dandeessu natti hin fakkaatu.
No one wants anything.	Namni homaa barbaadu hin jiru.
This is not my area.	Kun naannoo koo miti.
I have a good feeling about it	Waa'ee kanaa miira gaarii qaba
I shouldn’t have said that	Silaa akkas jechuu hin qabu ture
I want you there with me	Na waliin akka achi jirtu nan barbaada
I didn't tell him.	Ani itti hin himne.
It was too dangerous.	Garmalee balaa qaba ture.
I could have been one of them.	Silaa isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu nan danda'a ture.
I’m glad I got to know him	Isa beekuu kootti gammadeera
I always thought about you	Yeroo hundumaa waa'ee kee nan yaada ture
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
No one else was like her.	Namni biraa akka ishee hin turre.
I knew you didn’t understand.	Akka siif hin galle nan beeka ture.
We need to get that	Sana argachuu qabna
Lots of opportunities.	Carraa baay'ee.
Certainly it could be her mother.	Haadha ishee ta'uu akka danda'u beekamaadha.
I don’t know what came from them	Waan isaan irraa dhufe hin beeku
He wouldn't go now	Amma hin deemu ture
This is probably not true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
I hope it will be.	Akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
I just can't do this again	Ammas kana gochuu qofa hin danda'u
I want you inside me, now	Keessa kootti si barbaada, amma
It’s not really dangerous.	Dhuguma balaa hin qabu.
I want it very much.	Baay'een barbaada.
It worked very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjete.
I certainly wouldn’t tell anyone	Namatti akkan hin himne beekamaadha
Age shouldn’t be a factor.	Umuriin sababa ta’uu hin qabu.
But some people did.	Namoonni tokko tokko garuu ni godhu turan.
She made me come here.	As akkan dhufu na goote.
Maybe they will be.	Tarii ni ta'u ta'a.
Everyone loves this place.	Bakka kana namni hundi ni jaallata.
Not that it really matters.	Dhuguma dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
So far this is what I have tried.	Hanga ammaatti waanan yaale kana.
I never want to do that again	Kana booda gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin barbaadu
That shouldn’t be a problem.	Sun rakkoo ta’uu hin qabu.
I can't speak.	Dubbachuu hin danda'u.
I completely forgive you, my boy	Ani guutummaatti dhiifama siif godha gurbaa koo
Not before, but more importantly, not after.	Duraan osoo hin taane, kana caalaa barbaachisaa dha, booda miti.
I don't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himu.
You really are very incompetent.	Dhuguma ati baayyee ga'umsa hin qabdu.
I haven’t thought about it yet	Hanga ammaatti itti hin yaadne
The night was upon them.	Halkan isaan irra ture.
Your people were good people.	Namoonni keessan namoota gaarii turan.
I haven’t done any of that in a long time	Yeroo dheeraa keessatti sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne
From the subject.	Dhimma irraa.
I suggest that this is not the case	Kun akka hin taane yaada kooti
I really don't think about it much anymore	Dhuguma kana booda baay'ee hin yaadu
I could have done better	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu nan danda'a ture
He's pretty good at that sort of thing.	Inni waan akkasii irratti baayyee gaarii dha.
We hadn’t talked about this possibility before.	Kana dura waa’ee carraa kanaa hin dubbanne turre.
He wants me.	Na barbaada.
Everything is fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii dha.
You're in a completely different place.	Bakka guutummaatti adda ta'e keessa jirta.
It just might be.	Ta'uu qofa danda'a.
I have so much for you to do	Ani waan baay'ee siif gootu qaba
I really wanted to but I couldn't	Ani baay'een barbaade garuu hin dandeenye
He is still here.	Ammallee as jira.
I didn’t know him.	Isa hin beeku ture.
I just needed the money	Maallaqa sana qofa na barbaachisa ture
I was in the same situation	Anis haala wal fakkaatu keessa ture
Better than nothing.	Homaa ta'uu irra wayya.
I know almost nothing about children.	Waa'ee ijoollee homaa hin beeku jechuun ni danda'ama.
Something very serious	Waan baayyee hamaa ta'e
That’s when I saw her.	Yeroo sanatti ishee arge.
In and around my mouth.	Afaan koo keessaa fi naannoo isaa.
She is.	Isheen ... dha.
But you know better.	Garuu ati caalaatti beekta.
I should think it would be obvious	Ifa ta'a jedheen yaadu qaba
Man is dangerous.	Namni balaa qaba.
That was not inevitable.	Sun waan hin oolle hin turre.
I couldn’t tell him anything	Homaa itti himuu hin dandeenye
I think that was where he came from	Bakka inni dhufe sana ture jedheen yaada
I can't do anything good here	Asitti waan gaarii tokkollee hojjechuu hin danda'u
This has been special for us.	Kun adda nuuf ta'ee jira.
They were looking at her.	Ishee ilaalaa turan.
Good but not great.	Gaarii garuu guddaa miti.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
I certainly do that.	Ani akkas akkan godhu beekamaadha.
I mean, it's a big deal	Waan guddaa jechuu kooti
I thought you knew that	Kana waan beektu natti fakkaate
Whatever the food.	Nyaata maal iyyuu yoo ta'e.
It was all pretty great.	Hundi isaa baayyee guddaa ture.
But every single person took it.	Garuu namni tokko tokko tokko fudhate.
He stayed in that position for a while	Yeroo muraasaaf bakka sana ture
I know this exactly.	Kana sirriitti beeka.
I didn't understand this either	Anis kana hin hubanne
I'm working on mine	Kan koo irratti hojjechaa jira
A week later, an hour, a year	Torban tokko booda, sa'aatii tokko, waggaa tokko
She is very unique.	Baayyee adda qabdi.
I mean, this is all the same thing.	Kun hundi waan tokko jechuu kooti.
But he wasn't there.	Garuu achi hin turre.
I just want him to be a good person	Nama gaarii qofa akka ta'u nan barbaada
We wouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas hin goonu turre.
I didn’t know her.	Ishee hin beeku ture.
Being your own.	Kan keessan ta'uu.
I can be your twin	Ani lamaan kee ta'uu nan danda'a
But I have two problems with this.	Kana irratti garuu rakkoo lama qaba.
It looks really bad.	Dhuguma hamaa fakkaata.
No one has ever told me that before.	Namni kanaan dura akkas natti hime hin jiru.
I thought about it a lot	Baay'een itti yaade
He's not there for a couple of hours	Sa'aatii lama lama achi hin jiru
I love the person you are	Nama ati taate nan jaalladha
I can't do that for you.	Ani akkas siif gochuu hin danda'u.
Everyone here knows everyone else.	Asitti namni hundi nama hunda beeka.
I couldn't see what it was, yet	Maal akka ta'e arguu hin dandeenye, ammallee
Again, I began to walk in the light.	Ammas, ifa keessa deemuu jalqabe.
I should have known I needed him	Silaa akka inni na barbaachisu beekuu qaba ture
I want to know what it is and why	Maal akka ta'ee fi maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaada
She was doing her job.	Hojii ishee hojjechaa turte.
Can't you?.	Hin dandeessu?.
Most people just want a good answer	Namoonni baay'een deebii gaarii argachuu qofa barbaadu
But there was no hope.	Garuu abdiin hin turre.
I really wanted to go home	Gara manaatti deebi'uu baay'een barbaade
He loves everyone.	Nama hunda ni jaallata.
In this way, we are all the same.	Haala kanaan hundi keenya wal fakkaata.
I couldn’t think of anything else	Waan biraa yaadu hin dandeenye
There were two of us.	Lamaan keenya turre.
How this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu.
This was bad, but it could always be worse.	Kun hamaa ture, garuu yeroo hundumaa kana caalaa hamaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I like it simple.	Salphaa ta'ee natti tola.
How can you not love it?.	Akkamitti hin jaallattu?.
You need to know this.	Kana beekuu qabda.
We weren’t going along then	Yeroo sana waliin deemaa hin turre
Can't work around it	Naannoo isaa hojjechuu hin danda'u
He looks new.	Inni haaraa fakkaata.
We are going to do something.	Waan tokko gochuuf jirra.
But you know me.	Ati garuu na beekta.
But they’re not the only ones.	Garuu isaan qofa miti.
That said, they don't have to be the same thing.	Kana jechuun, isaan waan tokko ta'uu hin qaban.
That is very important.	Sun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
I think we have good reason.	Sababa gaarii qabna jedheen yaada.
That you still love it, just don’t buy it.	Ammas akka jaallattu, bitachuu dhiisuu qofa.
It's for you.	Siif ta'a.
I don’t mean that at all	Ani tasumaa akkas jechuu koo miti
He wasn’t in here.	Inni as keessa hin turre.
I knew you would.	Akka gootu nan beeka ture.
You don't know me.	Ati na hin beektu.
I wasn't quite sure what that even meant	Sun illee maal jechuu akka taʼe guutummaatti hin beeku ture
By himself.	Ofii isaatiin.
It has for a long time	Yeroo dheeraaf qaba
I was with her.	Ani ishee waliin ture.
Maybe someone did.	Tarii namni tokko akkas godhe ta'a.
I always wanted this life	Yeroo hundumaa jireenya kana barbaada ture
He had a bad feeling about this one	Isa kanaaf miira hamaa qaba ture
I didn’t see a problem with that	Sana irratti rakkoo hin argine
I know how to do that	Akkamitti akkan sana godhu nan beeka
I couldn't have done it without him	Silaa isa malee gochuu hin danda'u ture
My eyes are bad.	Ija koo hamaa.
It was terrible.	Hamaa ture.
I wasn't sure if it was good or bad	Gaarii fi hamaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa hin turre
You think you know what you don’t.	Waan hin beekne akka ati beektu sitti fakkaata.
Everyone wants to do that.	Namni hundi akkas gochuu barbaada.
I need someone.	Nama na barbaachisa.
None of these things work.	Wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjetu.
I wasn’t expecting it	Ani eegaa hin turre
They were still waiting.	Ammas eegaa turan.
Like her parents.	Akkuma warra ishee.
I'm there, too.	Anis jira.
I wish none of this happened	Kun tokkollee osoo hin taane natti tola
Not too soon.	Dafee miti.
It was her mother.	Haadha ishee ture.
I can't stay in this place any longer	Kana booda bakka kana turuu hin danda'u
I didn’t quite do it.	Ani guutummaatti hin goone.
I know you can’t quit your job	Hojii kee dhiisuu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka
But so far everything seems to be going well.	Garuu hanga ammaatti wanti hundi haala gaarii irra kan jiru fakkaata.
I didn’t think about it that much	Ani hangas itti hin yaadne
About my work.	Waa'ee hojii koo.
She didn’t need any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee ishee hin barbaachifne.
I can't be here all the time	Yeroo hundumaa as jiraachuu hin danda'u
You are the only person who can help me.	Nama na gargaaruu danda'u si qofa.
It’s not good anymore	Kana booda gaarii miti
I thought that was a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaate.
I was expecting it to look bad	Hamaa fakkaata jedheen eegaa ture
I wanted to scream.	Ani iyyuu barbaade.
That’s the whole problem.	Rakkoon jiru hundi kanuma.
Which always happens.	Kan yeroo hunda ta'u.
He is still there.	Ammas achi jira.
I just thought it was a joke	Qoosaa qofa natti fakkaate
Then we became friends again.	Sana booda ammas hiriyyoota taane.
I mean really.	Dhuguma jechuu kooti.
It must be in the morning.	Ganama ta'uu qaba.
But some people do.	Namoonni tokko tokko garuu ni godhu.
I don't know what happened there, but I'm not with them anymore.	Achitti maaltu akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu kana booda isaan waliin hin jiru.
I was a name.	Ani maqaa ture.
We are in a good position in our class.	Kutaa keenya keessatti bakka gaarii irra jirra.
The time has now passed.	Yeroon amma darbe.
We had a real problem.	Rakkoo dhugaa qabna turre.
I didn’t want to tell him that	Ani akkas itti himuu hin barbaanne
He was willing to work with you	Si waliin hojjechuuf fedhii qaba ture
It really seems like they have.	Dhuguma waan qaban fakkaata.
He wouldn't have.	Silaa hin qabu ture.
I wonder what happened to those people	Namoota sana maaltu ta'e jedheen yaada
But that doesn’t exist anymore.	Garuu sun kana booda hin jiru.
Everyone about him knew that.	Namni waa'ee isaa jiru hundi kana ni beeka ture.
I wanted to give up my life.	Jireenya koo dhiisuu barbaade.
I think this is important.	Kun barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
Not two.	Lama miti.
He lives in it.	Inni keessa jiraata.
I've never been in there	Ani achi keessa kan ta'ee hin beeku
I can't say enough good things	Waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u
This isn’t me.	Kun ana miti.
I can't do another one.	Kan biraa gochuu hin danda'u.
I wondered what that might mean.	Sun maal jechuu akka dandaʼu nan yaade.
This wasn't it, there was no need for him here.	Kun hin turre, asitti wanti isa barbaachisu hin turre.
I was sure at the time.	Yeroo sanatti mirkanaa'aa ture.
That wouldn't be so bad.	Sun akkas hamaa hin ta'u ture.
He said he wanted to give us a chance.	Carraa nuuf kennuu barbaada jedhe.
I wish it was, but it's not	Osoo ta'ee natti tola, garuu hin ta'u
More people want to see it.	Namoonni baay'een arguu barbaadu.
He had nothing.	Homaa hin qabu ture.
I can leave this matter at that.	Dhimma kana akkasitti dhiisuu nan danda'a.
I can't ask.	Gaafachuu hin danda'u.
She was drinking tonight.	Halkan kana dhugaa turte.
I want to be in that.	Sana keessa ta'uu barbaada.
I haven’t figured this out yet	Hanga ammaatti kana hin hubanne
I told him it was on	Irra jira jedheen itti hime
If he wants something, he goes for it.	Yoo waan tokko barbaade itti deema.
He took the food quickly.	Nyaata sana dafee fudhate.
He wanted me for something.	Waan tokko na barbaade.
I didn't think there was	Ni jira jedhee hin yaadne
But that didn’t matter.	Garuu sun homaa hin qabu ture.
You are no longer that person.	Kana booda ati nama sana miti.
I knew nothing better than you.	Si caalaa homaa hin beeku ture.
We should do it again soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti ammas gochuu qabna.
It was good to go.	Deemuun gaarii ture.
But then we went home.	Sana booda garuu gara manaatti deemne.
It’s the most important thing right now	Yeroo ammaa kana waan hunda caalaa barbaachisaa dha
But he did more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa hojjete.
I can do better than you.	Si caalaa hojjechuu nan danda'a.
Excellent.	Baay'ee gaarii.
There was still hope.	Ammallee abdiin ture.
That was my mistake last week.	Torban darbe dogoggora koo kanuma ture.
He doesn’t seem to have done so.	Akkas waan godhe hin fakkaatu.
Bad bad bad.	Hamaa hamaa hamaa.
I’ve been there with her a couple of times.	Yeroo lama lama ishee waliin achi tureera.
We have to be here.	As ta'uu qabna.
I need to do that now	Amma sana gochuun na barbaachisa
I need to know a little something	Waan xiqqoo beekuu na barbaachisa
This looked pretty good.	Kun baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
I think it would be great though	Ani garuu guddaa ta'a jedheen yaada
I have to do it twice.	Yeroo lama gochuun qaba.
But this wasn’t working.	Garuu kun hojjechaa hin turre.
That's how it worked, most of the time.	Akkasitti hojjeta ture, yeroo baayyee.
What are they doing is all you need to meet.	Maal gochaa jiru waan ati wal arguu qabdu hunda.
Always wanted to see it but never did.	Yeroo hundumaa arguu barbaada ture garuu arguu hin beeku.
I have no problem with your question	Anis gaaffii keessan irratti rakkoo hin qabu
I often thought that	Yeroo baayʼee akkas jedheen yaada ture
Not that often we disagree	Yeroo baayyee akkasitti walii hin galle miti
That never really happens	Sun dhuguma gonkumaa hin ta'u
That wasn’t them.	Sun isaan hin turre.
I love the freshness	Haaraa ta'uu isaa nan jaalladha
This was no longer my father.	Kana booda kun abbaa koo hin turre.
This was not the case.	Kun akkas hin turre.
I never saw her again that day	Guyyaa sana booda ishee hin argine
Sometimes with both.	Yeroo tokko tokko lamaan isaanii waliin.
You just have to find them.	Isaan argachuu qofa qabda.
It must be one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu qaba.
He doesn't know anything.	Inni homaa hin beeku.
We have a room.	Kutaa qabna.
Interviews and interviews.	Gaaffii fi deebii.
I said that was fine	Anis sun gaarii dha jedheen
Usually wrong, very wrong.	Yeroo baay'ee dogoggora, baay'ee dogoggora.
He had a lot of ideas.	Yaada baay'ee qaba ture.
I hadn't thought much about it	Waa'ee isaa baay'ee hin yaadne ture
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
I don’t understand the past.	Waan darbe naaf hin galle.
But that was good enough.	Garuu sun gaarii gahaa ture.
If not a car, then something in the house.	Yoo konkolaataa hin taane, sana booda waan mana keessa jiru.
In those days, when you had a good job, you wouldn’t go.	Bara sana yeroo hojii gaarii qabdu hin deemtu turte.
It's not right.	Sirrii miti.
During that month.	Ji'a sana keessa.
Like that was going to happen.	Akkuma sun ta'uuf ture.
The present is not the same as in the past.	Kan ammaa akka durii miti.
You should have been there.	Silaa achi jiraachuu qabda ture.
He was always thoughtful.	Yeroo hundumaa kan yaadu ture.
I want to go tomorrow.	Boru deemuu barbaada.
That he can do it.	Akka inni gochuu danda'u.
It's going to be really, really great.	Dhuguma dhuguma guddaa ta'uuf deema.
I'm here to help.	Gargaaruuf as jira.
I don't understand them.	Isaan naaf hin galle.
In me, about me.	Ana keessa, waa'ee koo.
He knew he loved her.	Ishee akka jaallatu ni beeka ture.
I don’t think anyone else is in here.	Namni biraa as keessa waan jiru natti hin fakkaatu.
Something from the past.	Waan bara durii irraa.
Money John around.	Maallaqa Yohaannis naannoo.
Maybe it's forgiveness.	Tarii dhiifama ta'uu danda'a.
But she could not believe it.	Isheen garuu kana amanuu hin dandeenye.
A little different.	Xiqqoo adda.
Nothing seems to work.	Wanti hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
Maybe that's how it should be.	Tarii akkas ta'uu qaba.
Mostly it’s just me.	Irra caalaa ana qofa.
I think we worked well together.	Akka gaariitti waliin hojjenne jedheen yaada.
It was a long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Where no one knows.	Bakka namni tokkollee hin beekne.
Now you have nothing.	Amma homaa hin qabdu.
This becomes very clear to us.	Kun baay’ee ifa nuuf ta’a.
He looked at us.	Nu ilaale.
These were good things.	Kun wantoota gaarii turan.
Must.	Dirqama.
Then she was there.	Sana booda achi turte.
But they do a very good job of it.	Garuu hojii baayyee gaarii itti hojjetu.
I didn’t want her there.	Akka isheen achi jirtu hin barbaanne.
This is that year.	Kun bara sana.
That was no longer true.	Kana booda sun dhugaa hin turre.
She is not my wife.	Isheen haadha manaa koo miti.
For a while this didn’t matter.	Yeroo muraasaaf kun homaa hin turre.
They didn’t do their homework.	Hojii manaa isaanii hin hojjenne.
Consider what happened when this happened.	Yeroo kun ta'u maaltu akka ture mee ilaalaa.
But of course it is possible.	Garuu beekamaadha ni danda'ama.
We were just looking for the right place.	Bakka sirrii barbaadaa turre qofa.
Someone who is not me.	Nama ana hin taane.
This shouldn’t be true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu hin qabu.
It was too simple.	Garmalee salphaa ture.
She had to do this.	Kana gochuu qabdi turte.
It’s on the way home.	Karaa manaa irra jira.
He could have done this.	Kana gochuu danda'a ture.
I couldn’t find the question.	Gaaffii sana argachuu hin dandeenye.
I was just so happy to go.	Deemuu kootti baayʼee gammade qofa ture.
It’s my house.	Mana kooti.
Me for him.	Ana isaaf.
It was good though.	Gaarii ture garuu.
Just one question.	Gaaffii tokko qofa.
Locals rarely come here.	Namoonni naannoo sanaa yeroo muraasaaf as dhufu.
You’re bigger than me.	Na caalaa guddaa taate.
That should have done it.	Sun gochuu qaba ture.
He told her everything she needed to know.	Waan beekuu qabdu hunda itti hime.
It meant extreme danger.	Balaa garmalee jechuu ture.
It’s almost hopeless.	Abdii hin qabne jechuun ni danda’ama.
This was your idea.	Kun yaada keessan ture.
You’re not the only one.	Ati qofa miti.
I'm very skeptical.	Ani baay'een shakka.
It can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u.
This is a good guy.	Kun gurbaa gaarii dha.
It would have been.	Silaa.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
They are very similar.	Baayyee wal fakkaatu.
It was very simple.	Baayyee salphaa ture.
That’s not exactly right.	Sun sirriitti sirrii miti.
You could see that last year.	Bara darbe sana arguu dandeessa turte.
He might come here to help.	Gargaaruuf as dhufuu danda'a.
I haven’t seen anyone in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf nama hin argine.
He had his way with her.	Karaa isaa ishee waliin qaba ture.
He had no mouth.	Afaan hin qabu ture.
He wanted me to go.	Akkan deemu barbaade.
But it’s not like that, is it.	Garuu akkas miti mitii.
But still, he was great.	Garuu ammas, inni guddaa ture.
He still hasn't told me much.	Ammallee waan baay'ee natti hin himne.
You only need one place.	Bakka tokko qofa si barbaachisa.
There had never been such a time before.	Kanaan dura yeroon akkasii hin turre.
I have no domestic help.	Gargaarsa manaa hin qabu.
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
Now he was here.	Amma as ture.
But not much help.	Garuu gargaarsa guddaa miti.
They had good reason to do so.	Kana gochuuf sababa gaarii qabu turan.
People like you.	Namoonni akka kee.
This is so very wrong.	Kun akkas baayyee dogoggora.
He wondered what to say, what to do.	Maal jedha, maal godhu jedhee yaade.
One could even say she was daddy's daughter.	Namni tokko intala abbaa ture jechuu illee danda'a.
I could help her.	Ishee gargaaruu nan dandaʼa ture.
I hadn’t really thought this through.	Kana sirriitti hin yaadne ture.
Until recently, that is.	Hanga yeroo dhiyootti, jechuun.
This doesn't seem to have happened.	Kun waan ta'e hin fakkaatu.
My little house.	Mana koo xiqqoo.
They have two children.	Ijoollee lama qabu.
With a little bit.	Xiqqoo waliin.
But maybe that wasn't always the case.	Garuu tarii yeroo hunda akkas hin turre ta'a.
It won't be long.	Dheeraa hin ta'u.
You don't have to say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin qabdu.
Nothing special.	Wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
Maybe he's a little bigger than us.	Tarii inni nu caalaa xiqqoo guddaa ta'uu danda'a.
I haven’t met her yet.	Ammallee ishee waliin wal hin argine.
He didn’t have to do that.	Akkas gochuun isa hin barbaachifne.
I mean mostly.	Irra caalaa jechuu kooti.
Then a loud noise.	Sana booda sagalee guddaa tokko.
But you know what it is.	Garuu maal akka ta'e beekta.
Having the same exact issue.	Dhimma sirrii wal fakkaatu qabaachuu.
Please wait a moment.	Mee yeroo muraasaaf eegaa.
Someone else was there that night.	Halkan sana namni biraa achi ture.
I mean the language.	Afaan jechuu kooti.
I mean that, of course	Akkas jechuun koo beekamaadha
It’s not for you.	Siif miti.
A few drinks, that’s all	Dhugaatii muraasa, kana qofa
He realized the answer too late.	Deebii isaa yeroon booda hubate.
It’s not just my husband.	Abbaa manaa koo qofa miti.
You had time to do that in the good old days.	Bara gaarii durii sana gochuuf yeroo qabda turte.
I saw a lot here	Asitti waan baay'ee arge
I couldn't say it.	Jechuu hin dandeenye.
This should have done it.	Kun gochuu qaba ture.
You're not good enough.	Ati gaarii miti.
This was a great time.	Yeroon kun yeroo guddaa ture.
I got over it in a matter of hours	Sa'aatii muraasa keessatti irra darbe
I don’t mean it, not really	Ani jechuu koo miti, dhuguma miti
I can live with that.	Sana waliin jiraachuu nan danda'a.
But I can't do what I say	Maal jedhee garuu hojjechuu hin danda'u
You just have this feeling.	Miira kana qofa qabda.
I didn't, but she can't be alone	Ani hin goone, garuu isheen kophaa ta'uu hin dandeessu
I knew it had to be something like that	Waan akkasii ta'uu akka qabu nan beeka ture
You shouldn’t be here.	As jiraachuu hin qabdu.
He meant well, of course.	Inni gaarii jechuu isaa beekamaadha.
It worked very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjete.
We really need it.	Dhuguma nu barbaachisa.
I don’t love myself	Of hin jaalladhu
I need a couple of days	Guyyaa lama lama na barbaachisa
He was the only one who got that.	Sana kan argate isa qofa ture.
As.	Akka.
Not sure.	Mirkanaa'aa miti.
But it is dangerous.	Garuu balaa qaba.
So we have to go further.	Kanaaf kana caalaa deemuun dirqama.
Only once.	Yeroo tokko qofa.
I wondered why though.	Maaliif jedheen yaade garuu.
I will go with them.	Isaan waliin nan deema.
It was just one of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokko qofa ture.
Again, nothing had happened.	Ammas wanti taʼe hin turre.
She didn't tell him where she was	Bakka jirtu itti hin himne
He was in it twice.	Yeroo lama keessa ture.
But, that is not the reality of this case.	Garuu, sun dhugaa dhimma kanaa miti.
I couldn't play the part .	Kutaa sana taphachuu hin danda'u ture .
But not in two days.	Garuu guyyaa lama keessatti miti.
They have to work together.	Waliin hojjechuu qabu.
This is the real work.	Hojiin dhugaa kana.
They are in this room, tonight.	Kutaa kana keessa jiru, halkan kana.
I have no idea what that means	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta'e yaada hin qabu
But that's about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa kanuma.
I think that’s a good idea.	Sun yaada gaarii natti fakkaata.
I am a human being.	Ani nama.
We had two years.	Waggaa lama qabna turre.
They don’t have time.	Yeroo hin qaban.
Not too long.	Baay'ee dheeraa miti.
I'm happy for him.	Isaaf gammadeera.
This is the right way.	Kun karaa sirrii dha.
I have.	Ani qaba.
Who has no idea.	Eenyu yaada hin qabu.
I was in it.	Ani keessa ture.
It was just the door.	Balbala qofa ture.
Now she had to go home.	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu qabdi turte.
They were twins.	Isaan lamaan lamaan turan.
They’re not that great.	Isaan hangas guddaa miti.
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
It wasn’t.	Hin turre.
I can do it.	Ani gochuu nan danda'a.
Not sure that you do.	Akka ati gootu mirkanaa'aa miti.
It could have even been human.	Silaa nama illee ta'uu danda'a ture.
Love it so much.	Baay'ee jaalladhu.
I think it must be a guy.	Gurbaa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
he had to give up.	dhiisuu qaba ture.
I knew what it was like.	Maal akka fakkaatu nan beeka ture.
I couldn’t help her.	Ishee gargaaruu hin dandeenye.
It is in another time.	Yeroo biraa keessa jira.
I was like, this wasn’t going to work.	Ani akka, kun hin hojjetu ture.
He never has time for me.	Inni gonkumaa naaf yeroo hin qabu.
I can't leave her.	Ishee dhiisuu hin danda'u.
He thought so.	Akkas jedhee yaade.
It needs to go.	Deemu barbaachisa.
He can help them.	Isaan gargaaruu dandaʼa.
Yours is the right.	Kan keessan.
But look at him.	Garuu isa ilaalaa.
I still love her.	Ammallee ishee jaalladha.
I can't do anything.	Waan hojjechuu hin danda'u.
I like it better that way.	Akkasitti caalaatti natti tola.
Another and another.	Kan biraa fi kan biraa.
It was really pretty simple.	Dhuguma baayyee salphaa ture.
Maybe it's here.	Tarii as ta'uu danda'a.
They had to find him.	Isa argachuu qabu turan.
It's going to be bad.	Hamaa ta'a.
Watch the relevant interview here.	Gaaffii fi deebii barbaachisaa ta'e as ilaalaa.
That’s where you go wrong.	Bakka ati dogoggora deemtu kanuma.
All you do is sleep.	Wanti ati gootu hirriba qofa.
That's happening.	Sun ta'aa jira.
He loved doing and being new things.	Inni waan haaraa hojjechuu fi ta'uu ni jaallata ture.
That should have been hours ago.	Sun sa'aatii dura ta'uu qaba ture.
Knowing in playing.	Taphachuu keessatti beekuu.
I can be everything you need.	Ani waan isin barbaachisu hunda ta'uu nan danda'a.
There’s really nothing else like it.	Dhuguma wanti akkasii kan biraa hin jiru.
Being who he is, he couldn’t do anything else.	Eenyu ta’uu isaatiin waan biraa gochuu hin danda’u ture.
We need all the people we can get.	Namoota argachuu dandeenyu hunda nu barbaachisa.
He couldn't do that.	Akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
But that’s not the problem.	Garuu rakkoon jiru kanuma miti.
In this section.	Kutaa kana keessatti.
This one didn’t.	Inni kun hin goone.
That’s a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii dha.
They should give me a chance.	Carraa naaf kennuu qabu.
Very good clothes.	Uffata baayyee gaarii.
It was so great.	Akkas guddaa ture.
What happened, happened.	Waan ta'e, ta'e.
Much of this was good.	Kun baay’een isaa gaarii ture.
He took everyone.	Nama hunda fudhate.
I couldn’t quite believe it.	Ani guutummaatti amanuu hin dandeenye.
We didn’t have time for that.	Kanaaf yeroo hin qabnu turre.
The timing wasn’t right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii hin turre.
He obviously doesn’t exist.	Inni akka hin jirre ifaadha.
I knew this had to go.	Kun deemuu akka qabu nan beeka ture.
I've never been like that.	Ani akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
You know more dangerous than them.	Isaan caalaa balaa qabu beekta.
My own among them.	Isaan keessaa kan koo.
You were absolutely right.	Ati guutummaatti sirrii turte.
So you must have my clothes.	Kanaaf uffata koo qabaachuu qabda.
It’s just that simple.	Akkas salphaa qofa.
It was knowing that he wasn’t really that different from us.	Dhuguma akkas nu irraa adda akka hin taane beekuu ture.
But let me make one thing clear.	Garuu mee waan tokko ifa godhu.
You don’t have to do that.	Akkas gochuun dirqama miti.
That’s not real life.	Sun jireenya dhugaa miti.
I will do my best.	Waan danda'u hunda nan godha.
You know his name.	Maqaa isaa ni beekta.
He was just one person.	Inni nama tokko qofa ture.
It couldn't have happened.	Silaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
But, that would not be the case.	Garuu, akkas hin ta'u ture.
It doesn’t need to involve risk.	Balaa of keessaa qabaachuu hin barbaachisu.
I think so, but I'm not sure.	Akkas jedheen yaada, garuu mirkanaa'aa miti.
Maybe he and she .	Tarii inni fi isheen .
That was new.	Sun haaraa ture.
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
What you did.	Waan ati goote.
Yours and mine.	Kan kee fi kan koo.
Maybe we should have it.	Tarii qabaachuu qabna ta'a.
There were many of them.	Isaan baay'ee turan.
Didn't say much along the way.	Karaa irratti waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
Now I doubt it ever will.	Amma yoom iyyuu yoo ta'e nan shakka.
A full year ago.	Waggaa guutuu dura.
No one was there, but no one was there.	Namni tokkollee hin turre, garuu namni tokkollee hin turre.
I think they were ahead of their time.	Yeroo isaanii dura kan turan natti fakkaata.
How to know and know that.	Akkamitti beekuu fi sana beekuu.
Please more, more.	Mee caalaatti, caalaa.
That you’re interested in it, even.	Akka ati itti fedhii qabdu, illee.
But it was like that for a while.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf akkas ture.
No one told me that.	Namni akkas natti hime hin jiru.
But they never get their hands on him.	Garuu gonkumaa harka isaanii isa hin qaban.
Everything will be fine.	Hundi gaarii ta'a.
Inside the.	Keessatti.
They are together now.	Amma waliin jiru.
Maybe they are.	Tarii isaan ta'uu danda'u.
I don't know that they have anything to say about him.	Waa'ee isaa waan jedhu akka qaban hin beeku.
Nothing.	Homaa.
You don't know us.	Nu hin beektu.
No one saw anything.	Namni homaa arge hin jiru.
This is not true.	Kun dhugaa miti.
All that stuff.	Wanti sana hunda.
I still love you.	Ammallee si jaalladha.
I know you did.	Akka ati goote nan beeka.
I was just trying you.	Si qofa yaalaa ture.
In this case she is wrong.	Haala kana keessatti isheen dogoggora.
The only thing you have is yours.	Wanti ati qabdu tokko kan kee qofa.
They have long arms.	Harka dheeraa qabu.
We were both so lucky.	Lamaan keenyayyuu akkas carraa qabna turre.
When she was little.	Yeroo isheen xiqqoo turte.
But that’s not enough.	Garuu sun gahaa miti.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
He was looking for a real person.	Nama dhugaa barbaada ture.
This will be my year.	Kun bara koo ta'a.
Probably, never.	Tarii, gonkumaa miti.
I am very happy as of now.	Akka ammaatti baay'een gammadeera.
But, is this so, it certainly cannot be.	Garuu, kun akkas ta’aa, ta’uu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
Sometimes you don't know for sure.	Yeroo tokko tokko mirkanaa'aa hin beektu.
He knew that it could never happen.	Kan gonkumaa ta’uu akka danda’u ni beeka ture.
Important, must have.	Barbaachisaa, qabaachuu qaba.
No one but me survived.	Ana malee namni hin oolle.
Everything is working again.	Wanti hundi ammas hojjechaa jira.
I couldn’t say more.	Kana caalaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
She became someone else.	Nama biraa taate.
But it's not about you.	Garuu waa'ee kee miti.
But that was about it.	Garuu waa'ee isaa sun ture.
They want Him.	Isa barbaadu.
I have some ideas.	Ani yaada tokko tokko qaba.
I came home, too.	Anis gara manaatti dhufe.
But he couldn't do it on his own.	Garuu ofuma isaatiin hojjechuu hin danda'u ture.
It worked extremely well.	Garmalee akka gaariitti hojjete.
I didn’t want a husband.	Ani abbaa manaa hin barbaanne.
Not that he did much good.	Gaarii guddaa hojjete jechuu miti.
It’s not an idea.	Yaada miti.
Someone has to do it.	Namni tokko gochuu qaba.
Maybe they didn't.	Tarii isaan hin taane ta'a.
Outside of work.	Hojii ala.
The little girl.	Intala xiqqoo.
Sometimes it has a place but not always.	Yeroo tokko tokko bakka qaba garuu yeroo hunda miti.
But they are wrong.	Garuu dogoggora qabu.
Like the door.	Akkuma balbala.
So many things, so many emotions.	Wantoota baay'ee, miira baay'ee.
It doesn’t work anymore.	Kana booda hin hojjetu.
Everything worked fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjete.
Forgiveness is still possible.	Dhiifama gochuun ammallee ni danda'ama.
I certainly thought about it many times.	Yeroo baay'ee akkan yaade beekamaadha.
I wouldn’t have told him anything.	Silaa homaa itti hin himu ture.
I think it's right.	Sirrii natti fakkaata.
It seemed so wrong, everything seemed so wrong.	Akka malee dogoggora fakkaata ture, wanti hundi akka malee dogoggora fakkaata ture.
This is certainly important.	Kun barbaachisaa akka taʼe beekamaadha.
A lot of people are like that.	Namoonni baay'een akkas ta'u.
You are not a bad person.	Ati nama hamaa miti.
At that point you can be very lucky indeed.	Yeroo sanatti dhuguma baay'ee carraa qabaachuu dandeessa.
He knew his place.	Bakka isaa ni beeka ture.
About what happened.	Waa'ee waan ta'e.
It was doing really well.	Dhuguma gaarii hojjechaa ture.
It was true that we didn't have much in common.	Waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu akka hin qabne dhugaa ture.
I know this girl.	Intala kana nan beeka.
We still have a lot of work to do.	Ammallee hojii baay'ee qabna.
He said wait for him there.	Achitti isa eegaa jedhe.
We worked well together.	Akka gaariitti waliin hojjenne.
But it’s just a possibility.	Garuu carraa jiru qofa.
He was tall, good-looking.	Inni dheeraa, nama gaarii ture.
You shouldn't be here.	As ta'uu hin qabdu.
Now, you could be wrong.	Amma, dogoggora ta'uu dandeessa.
We have to play well.	Akka gaariitti taphachuu qabna.
That’s what you’re doing.	Wanti ati gochaa jirtu kanuma.
You know who and what you are.	Eenyu akka taate fi maal akka taate ni beekta.
But maybe it could do better.	Garuu tarii kana caalaa hojjechuu danda'a.
I just didn't know any better.	Kana caalaa kana qofa hin beeku ture.
The reason for the action.	Sababni gochaa.
It’s not just friends.	Hiriyyoota qofa miti.
It was necessary to say.	Jechuun dirqama ture.
Now it’s just one of us.	Amma nu keessaa tokko qofa.
I could ask him where he was at the time.	Yeroo sanatti eessa akka ture isa gaafachuu nan danda'a ture.
I mean that a lot.	Baay'ee akkas jechuu kooti.
That’s what it was.	Kanuma ture.
It couldn't have happened.	Silaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
Then he began to speak.	Sana booda dubbachuu jalqabe.
You knew nothing about it.	Ati waa'ee isaa homaa hin beektu turte.
I couldn't think.	Yaadu hin dandeenye.
Perhaps he wants another one now.	Tarii amma kan biraa barbaada taʼa.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
He's got enough.	Inni waan gahaa ta'e qaba.
It’s just her luck.	Carraa ishee qofa.
I have a feeling you do it often.	Yeroo baayyee akka gootu miira qaba.
This is a car.	Kun konkolaataa dha.
I don't understand why it's happening.	Maaliif akka ta'aa jiru naaf hin galle.
They’re just the two of them.	Isaan lamaan qofa.
It’s not us.	Nu miti.
She didn't say anything.	Isheen homaa hin dubbanne.
It made it easy.	Salphaa godhe.
That’s our business.	Sun dhimma keenya.
But he’s not here yet.	Garuu ammallee as hin jiru.
None of it was mine anymore.	Kana booda tokkollee kan koo hin turre.
It doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u.
He loves that stuff.	Inni waan sana ni jaallata.
He knows you love him.	Akka ati isa jaallattu ni beeka.
I still couldn’t see her without her clothes.	Uffata ishee malee ammallee ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
I have no idea.	Ani yaada hin qabu.
You know it’s not.	Akka hin taane beekta.
I enjoyed it very, very much.	Baayyee baayyee itti gammadeera.
I don't think so.	Natti hin fakkaatu.
He was the only person in the room.	Kutaa sana keessa nama qofa ture.
But this problem, of course, is certainly not new.	Garuu rakkoon kun, beekamaadha, haaraa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I couldn't stop talking about you.	Waa'ee kee dubbachuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
It was always going to be something.	Yeroo hundumaa waan tokko ta'uuf ture.
If nothing else, he should have told his wife.	Yoo waan biraa hin taane, silaa haadha manaa isaatti himuu qaba ture.
I'll go for something else.	Waan biraa nan deema.
Sometimes you have to do it.	Yeroo tokko tokko gochuu qabda.
It could have been later.	Silaa booda ta'uu danda'a ture.
I can't do anything.	Ani homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
That's not going to happen.	Sun hin ta'u.
So we did what we had to do.	Kanaaf, wanta gochuu qabnu hojjenne.
as a person who.	akka nama eenyu.
So we went for it.	Kanaaf deemne.
They even look alike, a bit.	Isaan illee wal fakkaatu, xiqqoo.
In your car.	Konkolaataa keessan keessatti.
He wanted it so badly.	Inni akka malee barbaade.
But I couldn’t find him.	Garuu isa argachuu hin dandeenye.
She didn’t want to do that.	Isheen akkas gochuu hin barbaanne.
It all seemed real.	Hundi isaa dhugaa fakkaata ture.
I haven’t seen him play yet.	Hanga ammaatti taphachuu isaa hin argine.
Couldn't do anything about that now.	Amma waa'ee sanaa homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
This probably shouldn’t be a daily routine.	Kun tarii hojii guyyaa guyyaa ta’uu hin qabu.
It has this condition.	Haala kana qaba.
Two is not enough.	Lama gahaa miti.
I don't understand why this happened.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e naaf hin galle.
Not better than you.	Si caalaa miti.
He wouldn't have needed it.	Silaa isa hin barbaachisu ture.
It’s much more than that.	Kana caalaa baay’ee ta’e.
Everyone has a bad time.	Namni hundi yeroo hamaa qaba.
This was his real existence.	Kun jiraachuu isaa isa dhugaa ture.
Talk.	Dubbachuu.
But it has been necessary.	Garuu barbaachisaa ta'ee ture.
20 years ago.	Waggaa 20 dura.
I wonder what else is out there.	Kan biraa maaltu achi keessa jira jedheen yaada.
Nothing ever happened.	Homaa ta'ee hin beeku.
Eating at work.	Hojii irratti nyaata nyaachuu.
He knew what was happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru ni beeka ture.
He has three.	Sadii qaba.
He probably isn't.	Inni tarii ta'uu hin oolu.
It does something .	Waan tokko hojjeta .
You can even live someone else’s life.	Jireenya nama biraa illee jiraachuu dandeessa.
I have been waiting for this.	Kana eegaa tureera.
I don’t have a house.	Mana hin qabu.
He did it for you, for us.	Siif, nuuf godhe.
He had been there all morning without a thought of his work.	Ganama guutuu hojii isaa yaada tokko malee achi ture.
It would be nice if you did.	Osoo akkas goote gaarii ta'a.
But this is our mother.	Garuu kun haadha keenya.
I can't see it.	Ani arguu hin danda'u.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I think we did it.	Hojjenne natti fakkaata.
This is not my place.	Kun bakka koo miti.
I love questions.	Gaaffii baay'een jaalladha.
These people were great.	Namoonni kun guddaa turan.
I’ve known him for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isa beeka.
She doesn’t have to.	Isheen dirqama miti.
But no one really knows you unless they’ve been there.	Garuu dhuguma namni si beeku hin jiru yoo isaan achi turan malee.
I've been drinking a lot.	Baay'ee dhugaa tureera.
I could do it.	Hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture.
But he wasn’t like you.	Inni garuu akka kee hin turre.
He did that.	Sana godhe.
We talked about all this.	Kana hunda dubbanne.
But he does something different.	Inni garuu waan adda ta'e tokko hojjeta.
But not very long.	Garuu baay'ee dheeraa miti.
This was not what he wanted.	Kun waan inni barbaade hin turre.
Look at my hands.	Harka koo ilaalaa.
It was very dangerous.	Baayyee balaa qaba ture.
He knew there was a problem.	Rakkoon akka jiru ni beeka ture.
He has a school.	Mana barumsaa qaba.
I don’t know, that seems a bit dangerous.	Hin beeku, sun xiqqoo balaa qaba fakkaata.
I’m doing better now, really.	Amma kana caalaa hojjechaa jira, dhuguma.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
This works well for me.	Kun akka gaariitti naaf hojjeta.
The only problem is, they haven't really said what yet.	Rakkoon jiru, hanga ammaatti dhuguma maal akka ta'e hin dubbanne qofa.
They want to do right.	Isaan sirrii hojjechuu barbaadu.
I’ve known them for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf isaan beeka.
This is a good job.	Kun hojii gaarii dha.
I thought it was really great.	Dhuguma guddaa natti fakkaate.
But with you, he will.	Si waliin garuu ni godha.
They love it.	Ni jaallatu.
We never have time.	Gonkumaa yeroo hin qabnu.
I hope we can meet again.	Ammas wal arguu akka dandeenyu abdiin qaba.
Not just to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf qofa miti.
This is all obvious.	Kun hundi ifaadha.
Maybe we're not that special.	Tarii nuti hangas adda hin taane ta'a.
He is now our father.	Inni amma abbaa keenya.
I never think about it that way.	Ani akkasitti waa'ee isaa gonkumaa hin yaadu.
He had to help them.	Isaan gargaaruu qaba ture.
It was a real moment.	Yeroon sun yeroo dhugaa ture.
This was not enough.	Kun gahaa hin turre.
You are a very good case.	Ati dhimma baayyee gaarii dha.
Perhaps they are wrong to do so.	Tarii akkas gochuun isaanii dogoggora taʼuu dandaʼa.
Not the same job but exactly the same.	Hojii wal fakkaatu osoo hin taane sirriitti wal fakkaata.
But not then.	Garuu yeroo sana miti.
It must be one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu qaba.
Not for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf hin ta'u.
I can speak now.	Amma dubbachuu nan danda'a.
This wasn’t right.	Kun sirrii hin turre.
It wasn’t out of place.	Bakka ala hin turre.
But he doesn't have it.	Garuu hin qabu.
For a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf.
I didn’t know she knew.	Isheen akka beektu hin beeku ture.
She’s wrong, so wrong.	Isheen dogoggora qabdi, kanaaf dogoggora.
Not that he thought it would be like that.	Akkas ta'a jedhee yaade miti.
I don't love you, dog.	Si hin jaalladhu saree.
She had no children.	Ijoollee hin qabdu turte.
I knew he would do that.	Akkas akka godhu nan beeka ture.
In that area.	Naannoo sanatti.
Thoughts, thoughts, thoughts .	Yaada, yaada, yaada .
She had someone to go.	Nama deemu qabdi turte.
A completely different car, a completely different concept.	Konkolaataa guutummaatti adda ta'e, yaada guutummaatti adda ta'e.
It was on everything, up there.	Waan hundumaa irratti ture, achi ol.
This is not the issue.	Dhimma kana miti.
That may be true.	Sun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
He could never tell you.	Inni gonkumaa sitti himuu hin dandeenye.
The only thing obvious.	Wanti ifa ta'e qofa.
That sounds a lot like what we have now.	Sun waan amma qabnu baay'ee fakkaata.
He had to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuu qaba ture.
I still couldn’t see it.	Ammallee arguu hin dandeenye.
You can’t ask for anything more.	Kana caalaa waan tokko gaafachuu hin dandeessu.
It was a job.	Hojii ture.
I just don’t have it in me anymore.	Kana booda of keessaa hin qabu qofa.
What a husband.	Maal abbaa manaa.
We never have a chance.	Carraa gonkumaa hin qabnu.
I can't say enough about it.	Waa'ee isaa gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Something in that, maybe.	Waan sana keessa jiru, tarii.
But she wasn't supposed to know that.	Isheen garuu kana beekuu hin qabdu turte.
But this was different.	Kun garuu adda ture.
Just like what he does every morning.	Akkuma waan ganama ganama hojjetu ta'ee.
I just don’t want to go alone.	Kophaa koo deemuu qofa hin barbaadu.
He knew his own wife.	Haadha manaa ofii isaa beeka ture.
As we do.	Akkuma goonu.
He wasn’t there now.	Inni amma hin jiru ture.
In the afternoon he realized why.	Waaree booda maaliif akka ta'e hubate.
This is not what you want.	Kun waan ati barbaaddu miti.
She had to be.	Ta'uu qabdi turte.
Neither of us could play.	Lamaan keenyayyuu taphachuu hin dandeenye.
There was no one out.	Namni ba'e hin turre.
They had everything they needed.	Waan isaan barbaachisu hunda qabu turan.
It was her daughter.	Intala ishee ture.
What are you waiting for?.	Maal eegaa jirtu?.
You’ll need them later.	Booda isaan si barbaachisa.
Not all of them were great.	Hundi isaanii guddaa hin turre.
A little time passed.	Yeroon xiqqoo darbe.
He had two children.	Ijoollee lama qaba ture.
I will go to them.	Gara isaanii nan deema.
But he knew it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkasitti akka hin taane beeka ture.
It’s not a reason at all.	Tasumaa sababa miti.
I knew that couldn't happen.	Akkas ta'uu akka hin dandeenye nan beeka ture.
It must have been things he saw.	Wantoota inni arge taʼuu qaba.
You can always be yourself.	Yoomiyyuu of ta'uu dandeessa.
I have been here a long time.	Asitti yeroo dheeraa tureera.
Good friends now.	Hiriyyoota gaarii amma.
I still don't understand how this can happen.	Kun akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u ammallee naaf hin galle.
I'm excited.	Ani gammadeera.
Look at it again.	Ammas ilaalaa.
You know it, you know.	Ni beekta.
It’s not unique.	Adda miti.
It works well here.	Asitti akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I think she’s good for him.	Isheen isaaf gaarii natti fakkaata.
So it would be a good time.	Kanaaf yeroo gaarii ta'a.
That's for us.	Sun nuuf ta'a.
He never wanted her.	Inni gonkumaa ishee hin barbaanne.
What should we do?	Maal gochuu qabna.
Not good enough.	Gaarii gahaa miti.
It was just where you said it would be.	Bakka ati jette qofa ture.
It certainly can't be.	Ta'uu akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
I couldn't see her properly.	Ani sirriitti ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
Sometimes they can even be funny.	Yeroo tokko tokko qoosaa illee taʼuu dandaʼu.
But it came too late.	Garuu yeroon booda dhufe.
Wait a moment .	Yeroo muraasa eegaa .
We need to be absolutely clear on that.	Sana irratti guutummaatti ifa ta’uu qabna.
Maybe you two .	Tarii isin lamaan .
He wanted to speak again.	Ammas dubbachuu barbaade.
One of them in the car outside.	Isaan keessaa tokko konkolaataa ala jiru keessa.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
That’s what he would have done.	Silaa kanuma godha ture.
I don't think so.	Natti hin fakkaatu.
It wasn't very clear.	Baayyee ifa hin turre.
But he didn't.	Garuu hin goone.
They are good and they know it.	Isaan gaarii dha ni beeku.
Whether this is true or not, is not the question.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa, gaaffii miti.
This was my mother.	Kun haadha koo turte.
He must be making some mistakes.	Dogoggora tokko tokko hojjechaa jiraachuu qaba.
He has a wife and three children.	Haadha manaa fi ijoollee sadii qaba.
But it’s not their job.	Garuu hojii isaanii miti.
But we are better off.	Garuu nuti ni wayya.
It wasn't too bad in there.	Achi keessa baayyee hamaa hin turre.
You were drinking.	Ati dhugaa turte.
We are trying to work on it.	Itti hojjechuuf yaalaa jirra.
We have no idea where he is right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana eessa akka jiru yaada hin qabnu.
What was, was.	Wanti ture, ture.
Who is he? 	Inni eenyu?
I said it was going to happen.	Ta'uuf jira jedheen.
Speaking in this way.	Haala kanaan dubbachuu.
I don’t have any new clothes.	Uffata haaraa hin qabu.
The work seems right.	Hojiin sirrii fakkaata.
I wanted to be with them, not me.	Ana osoo hin taane isaan waliin ta'uu barbaade.
It had become her.	Ishee ta'ee ture.
It wasn’t a problem anymore.	Sana booda rakkoo hin turre.
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Some people would say it still exists.	Namoonni tokko tokko ammallee jira jedhu turan.
It’s just not where we can see her.	Bakka ishee arguu dandeenyu qofa miti.
But you can have a great watch.	Garuu sa'aatii guddaa qabaachuu dandeessa.
I don't know his real name.	Maqaa isaa isa dhugaa hin beeku.
It doesn't do anything.	Homaa hin godhu.
Making her want it.	Ishee akka barbaaddu gochuu.
Dad and daughter, obviously.	Abbaa fi intala, ifaadha.
So please take a look.	Kanaaf mee ilaalaa.
All well and good.	Hundi gaarii fi gaarii dha.
I have no other job.	Hojii biraa hin qabu.
Everyone knew that about me.	Waa'ee koo namni hundi akkas beeka ture.
Maybe you know why.	Tarii sababa isaa beektu ta'a.
Things were different tonight.	Halkan kana wanti jiru adda ture.
You know how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu ni beekta.
Today seemed like a good day.	Har'a guyyaa gaarii fakkaata ture.
I don't want trouble.	Rakkoo hin barbaadu.
Everything that can happen now.	Waan amma ta'uu danda'u hunda.
I still don't know.	Ammas hin beeku.
This is not good.	Kun gaarii miti.
I really don't even want to talk about it.	Dhuguma waa'ee isaa dubbachuu illee hin barbaadu.
To make something happen.	Waan tokko akka ta'uuf.
This can’t last long.	Kun yeroo dheeraa turuu hin danda’u.
It might even have been true.	Dhugaa illee taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
Which you do.	Kan ati gootu.
But it was then.	Garuu yeroo sana ture.
Sometimes he is even right.	Yeroo tokko tokko illee sirrii dha.
He wants to.	Inni barbaada.
Great.	Guddaa.
I knew he could see everything inside me.	Waan keessa koo jiru hunda akka arguu danda'u nan beeka ture.
What is the reason for this error.	Dogoggora kanaaf sababni maali.
Everything around us has a reason.	Wanti naannoo keenya jiru hundi sababa qaba.
I have no idea.	Yaada hin qabu.
He has a house.	Mana qaba.
It makes their year.	Waggaa isaanii godha.
But it didn’t work for me.	Garuu naaf hin hojjenne.
It happens for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
Maybe someone found it a long time ago.	Tarii namni tokko yeroo dheeraa dura argate ta'a.
It's just a sound.	Sagalee qofa.
You can believe me.	Na amanuu dandeessu.
It had to be.	Ta'uu qaba ture.
It’s in a good neighborhood.	Naannoo gaarii keessa jira.
Boston has no such luck.	Boston carraa akkasii hin qabdu.
He needs to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qaba.
I am very lucky.	Ani baayyee carraa qaba.
Everything, it seemed, was waiting.	Wanti hundi, waan eegaa jiru fakkaata ture.
Maybe we all have that in us.	Tarii hundi keenya sana nu keessa qabna ta'a.
Just what he needs.	Waan isa barbaachisu qofa.
He took both eyes.	Ija lamaan fudhate.
But now that is not necessary.	Amma garuu sun barbaachisaa miti.
He didn’t speak for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf hin dubbanne.
It’s not someone else’s.	Kan nama biraa miti.
The past is irrelevant.	Wanti darbe barbaachisaa miti.
You are absolutely fine.	Ati guutummaatti gaarii dha.
She wasn’t watching them.	Isheen isaan ilaalaa hin turre.
This is certainly what seems to have happened.	Kun waan ta’e fakkaatu akka ta’e beekamaadha.
He may be gone for a few hours.	Sa'aatii muraasaaf hin jirre ta'a.
This, so far, is probably my favorite.	Kun, hanga ammaatti, tarii kan ani jaalladhu ta’uu hin oolu.
I was just trying to be nice.	Gaarii ta'uuf qofa yaalaa ture.
He seemed to be in a great mood though.	Inni garuu miira guddaa keessa waan jiru fakkaata ture.
This seems unlikely.	Kun waan hin taane fakkaata.
Look at the door.	Mee balbala ilaalaa.
I don't know what happens there.	Achitti maaltu akka ta'u hin beeku.
So we’re just waiting.	Kanaaf eegaa qofa jirra.
I don’t know that girl.	Intala sana hin beeku.
You can’t do more than that.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
We need to know this.	Kana beekuu qabna.
More than nothing.	Homaa hin taane caalaa.
He was there then and he is here now.	Yeroo sanatti achi ture ammas as jira.
They are doing a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
He is in danger.	Balaa keessa jira.
There is still hope.	Ammas abdiin jira.
I think this is a big mistake.	Kun dogoggora guddaa natti fakkaata.
I’m with someone.	Nama tokko waliin jira.
She had it.	Isheen qabdi turte.
Then another voice.	Sana booda sagalee biraa.
I was like obvious.	Ani akka ifa ture.
I would have done it.	Silaa nan godha ture.
You know how this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu ni beektu.
I absolutely love it.	Guutummaatti nan jaalladha.
He had a reason.	Sababni qaba ture.
It's going to happen.	Ni ta'a.
Now everything works.	Amma wanti hundi ni hojjeta.
Everything you need to know.	Waan beekuu qabdu hunda.
This was no easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa hin turre.
It wasn't much.	Baay'ee hin turre.
About .	Waa'ee .
Such a thing is never true.	Wanti akkasii gonkumaa dhugaa miti.
It’s not me.	Ana miti.
This was very clear.	Kun baayyee ifa ture.
He was hers, hers alone.	Inni kan ishee ture, kan ishee qofa ture.
Now he could do a little better.	Amma kana caalaa xiqqoo hojjechuu danda'a ture.
There was nothing there.	Achitti wanti tokkollee hin turre.
Check it out later this time.	Yeroo kana booda ilaalaa.
I, he said.	Ani, jedhe.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Which works for me.	Kan naaf hojjetu.
I’m just looking at it.	Ani qofa ilaalaa jira.
But they were together.	Garuu waliin turan.
It could have been a lot of things though.	Silaa waan baay'ee ta'uu danda'a ture garuu.
A very good book.	Kitaaba baayyee gaarii.
He didn’t make that mistake.	Dogoggora sana hin hojjenne.
This is our job.	Kun hojii keenya.
he says.	jedha.
That person is just evil.	Namni sun hamaa qofa.
But I know it.	Ani garuu nan beeka.
That has happened many times.	Yeroo baayyee wanti akkasii ta'ee jira.
Both of you .	Lamaan keessan iyyuu .
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
I made him come.	Akka inni dhufu nan godhe.
It was terrible.	Hamaa ture.
I really don’t understand.	Dhuguma naaf hin galle.
But it never happened.	Garuu gonkumaa hin taane.
I think that was great.	Sun guddaa ture jedheen yaada.
But this was not happening.	Garuu kun ta'aa hin turre.
He can't do it.	Inni hin danda'u.
Sometimes, something has to give.	Yeroo tokko tokko, wanti tokko kennuu qaba.
I could do that now.	Amma akkas gochuu nan dandaʼa ture.
They want you.	Isaan si barbaadu.
He was great.	Inni guddaa ture.
That was a long time ago.	Sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
I like that.	Ani akkas natti tola.
But you couldn't be more wrong.	Garuu kana caalaa dogoggora ta'uu hin dandeessu.
He knew that voice well.	Sagalee sana sirriitti beeka ture.
This never happened.	Kun gonkumaa ta’ee hin beeku.
Now you think about it.	Amma itti yaaddu.
Even a little bit.	Xiqqoo illee.
That is no longer here.	Sun kana booda asitti hin jiru.
This should be the easiest.	Kun hunda caalaa salphaa ta'uu qaba.
I don't like children.	Ijoollee hin jaalladhu.
He was certainly older.	Inni umuriin isaa guddaa akka ture beekamaadha.
Good! 	Gaarii!
There was no need for another.	Kan biraa hin barbaachisu ture.
It was just a matter of finding the right subject.	Dhimma sirrii ta'e argachuu qofa ture.
But that was the problem.	Rakkoon garuu kanuma ture.
I love him very much.	Baay'een isa jaalladha.
I have to say it’s really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola jechuu qaba.
About what is important in life.	Waa'ee jireenya keessatti waan barbaachisaa ta'e.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
Repeat next time.	Yeroo biraa irra deebi'i.
But not always.	Garuu yeroo hunda miti.
Most of the time, it doesn't.	Yeroo baay'ee, hin ta'u.
I don't know what to do.	Maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
Maybe she should have.	Tarii qabaachuu qabdi turte ta'a.
I don't know if this is true or not.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
That was me.	Sun ana ture.
Now we are going.	Amma deemaa jirra.
Look at him.	Isa ilaalaa.
They are all the same.	Hundi isaanii tokko.
It’s not the same thing at all.	Tasumaa waan tokko miti.
She had no answers.	Deebii hin qabdu turte.
It wasn’t a big house.	Mana guddaa hin turre.
He wanted somewhere else.	Bakka biraa barbaada ture.
No one seems to be around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin fakkaatu.
All of you inside.	Hundi keessan keessa.
It is not necessary after that time.	Yeroo sana booda barbaachisaa miti.
But it’s all good.	Garuu hundi gaarii dha.
Not for a while too soon.	Yeroo muraasaaf dafee miti.
Sometimes we just have to give up.	Yeroo tokko tokko harka kennuu qofa qabna.
He can find another one.	Kan biraa argachuu danda’a.
He wanted to tell.	Himuu barbaade.
No one can help it.	Namni gargaaruu hin danda'u.
It seems that we are not.	Nuti waan hin taane fakkaata.
But even this would not work.	Garuu kun illee hin hojjetu ture.
We're looking at it.	Itti ilaalaa jirra.
You don't know.	Hin beektu.
I may not know today.	Har'a beekuu dhiisuu danda'a.
I don't think about it right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana hin yaadu.
This will indeed happen.	Kun dhuguma ni ta'a.
We don’t do this.	Kana hin goonu.
But she just had to say that.	Garuu akkas jechuu qofa qabdi turte.
That it couldn't be.	Akka ta'uu hin dandeenye.
Without the eyes.	Ija malee.
It will be someone who knows her.	Nama ishee beeku ta'a.
But it’s obviously not good enough.	Garuu gaarii akka hin taane ifaadha.
. . . .	.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
This was no big deal.	Kun waan guddaa hin turre.
But we did it.	Garuu ni goone.
Then it started again.	Sana booda ammas jalqabe.
Now you are with me.	Amma na waliin jirta.
We are no different.	Nuti adda miti.
I shouldn't have had him here.	Silaa asitti isa qabaachuu hin qabu ture.
As of now, it doesn’t matter anymore.	Akka ammaatti kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
But there’s always a reason.	Garuu yeroo hunda sababni jira.
It’s not easy, it’s never easy.	Salphaa miti, gonkumaa salphaa miti.
There’s nothing else she can do.	Kan biraa isheen gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
I could never give any answer.	Gonkumaa deebii tokkollee kennuu hin dandeenye.
It's probably true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin oolu.
Not you but the question.	Ati osoo hin taane gaaffii.
I have it now.	Amma qaba.
It seemed to be working.	Waan hojjechaa jiru fakkaata ture.
I know it’s not mine.	Kan koo akka hin taane nan beeka.
But today we were working with him on walking through it.	Har'a garuu keessa deemuu irratti isa waliin hojjechaa turre.
I like that very much.	Sana baayyee natti tola.
She was sure in her answers.	Deebii ishee keessatti mirkanaa'aa turte.
Two weeks ago.	Torban lama dura.
Right then and right there.	Yeroo sanatti fi sirriitti achitti.
It was always different.	Yeroo hundumaa adda ture.
Not three times.	Yeroo sadii miti.
More like.	Caalaatti akka.
I would have done that.	Silaa akkas nan godha ture.
But he was, above all, a gentleman.	Garuu inni, hunda caalaa, nama gaarii ture.
Once it was an issue, she wasn’t good.	Yeroo tokko dhimma ture, isheen gaarii hin turre.
That’s obvious.	Sun ifaadha.
I want us to be friends.	Akka hiriyyoota taane nan barbaada.
Luckily he did both.	Akka carraa ta'ee lamaan isaaniiyyuu ni godhe.
She could not have been more wrong.	Kana caalaa dogoggora taʼuu hin dandeessu turte.
I'm sure it doesn't.	Akka hin taane mirkanaa'adha.
I should have known that, but I don’t.	Silaa sana beekuu qaba ture, garuu hin beeku.
But this one does.	Inni kun garuu ni godha.
All of them for nothing.	Hundi isaanii homaa malee.
I couldn't have done it.	Silaa gochuu hin danda'u ture.
Maybe he even has.	Tarii illee qabaachuu danda'a.
. . . .	.
There is no need to do it again.	Ammas gochuun hin barbaachisu.
It really doesn't.	Dhuguma hin ta'u.
But the problem remains.	Garuu rakkoon jiru ammallee jira.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.	Xiqqoo kana, xiqqoo sana.
We are similar, but different.	Nuti wal fakkaata, garuu adda adda.
It worked out well.	Akka gaariitti hojjete.
It’s better not to.	Osoo hin taane wayya.
This can be very true.	Kun baay’ee dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
I still want to go.	Ammas deemuun barbaada.
It didn’t work then, it doesn’t work now.	Yeroo sana hin hojjenne, amma hin hojjetu.
But here is something different.	Garuu asitti wanti adda ta'e.
None of them were probably looking too good at the time.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee tarii yeroo sanatti garmalee gaarii ilaalaa hin turre.
You don’t need to do anything else.	Waan biraa gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
And I said, 'It is.	Anis akkas jedheen.
Right on your shoes.	Kophee kee irratti sirriitti.
I have nothing bad to say about them really.	Waa'ee isaanii waan hamaa dubbachuu hin qabu dhuguma.
Not even tonight.	Halkan kana illee miti.
It was just a few drinks.	Dhugaatii muraasa qofa ture.
I didn't see it.	Hin argine.
You are.	Ati ...dha.
I don't want that.	Ani akkas hin barbaadu.
I'm not with him.	Ani isa waliin hin jiru.
They know their own situation better than we do.	Haala ofii nu caalaa beeku.
They don’t feel good.	Miira gaarii hin qaban.
But they are not us.	Garuu isaan nu miti.
But I can't do it.	Garuu ani gochuu hin danda'u.
I hope that helps my case.	Sun dhimma koo akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I couldn't have done this without you.	Osoo ati hin taane kana gochuu hin danda'u ture.
This worked for me.	Kun naaf hojjete.
But today it wasn't.	Har'a garuu hin turre.
But it worked for me.	Garuu naaf hojjete.
But then, they couldn’t say anything.	Garuu sana booda, homaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye turan.
Just his eyes.	Ija isaa qofa.
Where we have been before.	Bakka kanaan dura turre.
It will be just like in the old days.	Akkuma bara durii ta'a.
As it always was.	Akkuma yeroo hundumaa ture.
I didn’t want it to go badly.	Hamaa akka deemu hin barbaanne.
I don't understand how much of it happened.	Baay'een isaa akkamitti akka ta'e naaf hin galle.
Something very serious.	Waan baayyee hamaa ta'e.
Another good thing about it.	Waan gaarii biraa waa'ee isaa.
Now there were two of them.	Amma isaan keessaa lama turan.
We can’t do it without it.	Isa malee gochuu hin dandeenyu.
We did it.	Hojjenne.
I am very happy.	Ani baayyee gammadeera.
I love my new home.	Mana koo haaraa nan jaalladha.
This is all just fine.	Kun hundi gaarii qofa.
This was not one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko hin turre.
Now it was mine.	Amma kan koo ture.
He is a human being.	Inni nama.
Nothing really happened there.	Dhuguma achitti wanti ta'e hin jiru.
It is not perfect at all.	Tasumaa illee guutuu miti.
Someone is working.	Namni tokko hojjechaa jira.
I'm sure there is.	Akka jiru mirkanaa'adha.
That’s how right it is.	Akkas sirrii dha.
Not enough to last us very long.	Baayyee yeroo dheeraa nuuf turuuf gahaa miti.
I don't know what the problem is.	Rakkoon jiru maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
We just didn’t.	Nuti garuu hin taane qofa.
I have been around.	Ani naannoo sana tureera.
It was a great moment in her life.	Jireenya ishee keessatti yeroo guddaa ture.
Sometimes this may not be the case.	Yeroo tokko tokko kun taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
Which is not the case.	Kan hin taane.
It worked, he always had it for him.	Hojjete, yeroo hundumaa isaaf qaba ture.
Of what we have done.	Waan hojjenne keessaa.
I wouldn’t have gone anywhere else.	Silaa bakka biraa hin deemu ture.
Who you are and what you don’t do was more important.	Eenyu akka taate maal akka hin goone caalaatti barbaachisaa ture.
I was never sure she really loved him.	Dhuguma akka isa jaallattu mirkanaa'aa ta'ee hin beeku.
No lights, no sound, no nothing.	Ifa hin qabu, sagalee hin qabu, homaa hin qabu.
But this did not last long.	Garuu kun yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I want you to know her.	Ishee akka beektu nan barbaada.
That’s one of my reasons.	Sababni koo keessaa tokko kanuma.
There was nothing else for him to do.	Wanti biraa inni hojjetu hin turre.
With her life and their lives.	Jireenya ishee fi jireenya isaanii waliin.
But he certainly didn’t.	Garuu akka hin goone beekamaadha.
Ours has plenty.	Kan keenya baay'ee qaba.
But she had to come.	Garuu dhufuu qabdi turte.
The day and that.	Guyyaa fi sana.
No one was with her.	Namni ishee waliin hin turre.
One of us.	Tokko keenya.
I was very pleased with this.	Kana baay'een gammade.
Not so, obviously.	Akkas miti, ifaadha.
There it is, of course.	Achi jira, beekamaadha.
Most people like to talk about themselves.	Namoonni baay’een waa’ee ofii isaanii dubbachuu jaallatu.
He didn’t like going here alone.	Kophaa koo as deemuu hin jaallatu ture.
I hoped he understood.	Akka hubate abdiin qaba ture.
They are in school.	Mana barumsaa keessa jiru.
I can't see why they can't just leave us alone.	Maaliif kophaa keenya qofa nu dhiisuu akka hin dandeenye arguu hin danda'u.
Those were real.	Isaan sun dhugaa turan.
That’s not work for you.	Sun siif hojii miti.
More likely so.	Caalaatti akkas ta'uu danda'a.
It’s not really good.	Dhuguma gaarii miti.
Fortunately, it's not needed.	Akka carraa ta'ee hin barbaachisu.
It wouldn't have happened at home.	Silaa mana keessatti hin ta'u ture.
Obviously, something was wrong.	Wanti tokko dogoggora akka ture ifaadha.
He spoke after a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa booda dubbate.
But you don't love me.	Ati garuu na hin jaallattu.
I'm going to work on a lot of that today.	Har'a waan sana baay'ee irratti hojjechuuf deema.
It doesn't do anything.	Homaa hin godhu.
I don't think that's the case.	Akkas ta'a jedhee hin yaadu.
But those are the ones you want.	Garuu warra ati barbaaddu sun.
Then several weeks ago, it happened.	Sana booda torban hedduu dura, ta'e.
He didn’t want me to go.	Akkan deemu hin barbaanne.
He doesn't have any sound.	Sagalee tokkollee hin qabu.
It doesn't have a sound.	Sagalee hin qabu.
It might just mean a book.	Kitaaba jechuu qofa ta’uu danda’a.
You know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'uuf jiru ni beekta.
It is in the past.	Yeroo darbe keessa jira.
I had a chance to do it.	Carraa gochuun qaba ture.
We agreed to it.	Itti walii galle.
You tell me.	Ati natti himi.
But then, maybe he had.	Garuu sana booda, tarii qaba ture ta'a.
Please take a look.	Mee ilaalaa.
I couldn’t see anything.	Waan tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
I don't know why it would happen.	Maaliif akka ta'u hin beeku.
It must be in that area.	Naannoo sanatti ta'uu qaba.
It was doing very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa ture.
I had no idea how.	Akkamitti akka ta'e yaada hin qabu ture.
I was his hope.	Ani abdii isaa ture.
They were pretty good last year.	Bara darbe baayyee gaarii turan.
He's looking at her.	Ishee ilaalaa jira.
I know it's me.	Ana akka ta'e nan beeka.
I know it’s not.	Akka hin taane nan beeka.
That was fine, as far as it went.	Sun gaarii ture, hanga deeme.
It was doing very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa ture.
We have enough new ones.	Haaraa gahaa qabna.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Waan hojjetu hin beeku ture.
It was a joke.	Qoosaa ture.
The bad old days.	Bara hamaa durii.
Enough.	Gahaa.
It wasn’t something he looked at.	Waan inni ilaale hin turre.
That's not right.	Sun sirrii miti.
So, tell me.	Kanaaf, natti himi.
You can't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeessu.
It was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture.
He needs to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu qaba.
He couldn't.	Hin dandeenye.
Usually during the week.	Yeroo baayyee torban keessa.
She was much older than me.	Isheen baay'ee na caalaa turte.
Location, location, location!.	Bakka, bakka, bakka!.
But we are still there.	Garuu ammas achi jirra.
We only had to stay an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko qofa turuu qabna turre.
That’s not mine.	Sun kan koo miti.
Nothing seemed to work.	Wanti hojjetu hin fakkaatu ture.
It’s my job.	Hojii kooti.
He thought about it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf yaada itti kenne.
There was no work.	Hojiin tokkollee hin turre.
But it was true.	Garuu dhugaa ture.
But, this is not the case.	Garuu, kun akkas miti.
Just like us.	Akkuma keenya.
It just wouldn’t have looked right.	Silaa sirrii hin fakkaatu ture qofa.
Most likely, it’s probably both.	Baay’ee kan hin oolle, lamaan isaaniiyyuu ta’uu hin oolu.
He loves to know.	Beekuu baay'ee jaallata.
She has a lot of friends.	Hiriyyoota baay'ee qabdi.
The people who should have been there for you were not there.	Namoonni silaa siif ta'uu qaban hin turre.
I wasn't so sure.	Ani akkas mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It should have been.	Silaa ta'uu qaba ture.
Much better than me.	Na caalaa baayyee gaarii dha.
I thought of him often.	Yeroo baay'ee isa yaada ture.
I thought we were in good shape.	Haala gaarii keessa jirra jedheen yaade.
What can you tell me?.	Maal natti himuu dandeessu?.
Your mother.	Haadha kee.
But he was.	Inni garuu ture.
I am new to these things.	Ani wantoota kanaaf haaraa dha.
We are, however.	Nuti garuu.
I'm not there.	Ani achi hin jiru.
That seemed like an extremely simple answer.	Sun deebii garmalee salphaa fakkaata ture.
Whatever happens, it happens.	Waan ta'u, ni ta'a.
No one had a chance to live.	Namni carraa jiraachuu qabu hin turre.
I just can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu qofa hin danda'u.
If so, come back.	Yoo akkas ta'e deebi'i.
That’s just not true anymore.	Sun kana booda dhugaa miti qofa.
Now we have too much.	Amma garmalee qabna.
He seemed to have thought it over.	Inni waan itti yaade fakkaata ture.
He needed food.	Nyaata isa barbaachisa ture.
I know exactly what that feels like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu sirriitti beeka.
That would be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'a.
It will be easier now.	Amma salphaa ta'a.
He is good for you.	Inni siif gaarii dha.
You are like my children.	Isin akka ijoollee kooti.
I'm sure this will turn out well.	Kun akka gaariitti akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha.
You can't help but be yourself.	Of ta'uu dhiisuu hin dandeessu.
He’s up there waiting for us.	Inni achi ol nu eegaa jira.
It used to be pretty good.	Duraan baayyee gaarii ture.
It wasn’t easy.	Salphaa hin turre.
She was doing all of that herself.	Sana hunda ofuma ishee hojjechaa turte.
Wait for an hour.	Sa'aatii tokko eegaa.
They know my name.	Maqaa koo ni beeku.
He’s good, but not that good.	Inni gaarii dha, garuu hangas gaarii miti.
They had to eat some.	Muraasa nyaachuu qabu turan.
I’m sorry, but that’s just it.	Dhiifama, garuu akkas qofa.
I’m not just saying that.	Ani akkas jechuu qofa miti.
It has people.	Namoota qaba.
It was easy to say you had to help the girl.	Intala sana gargaaruu qabda jechuun salphaa ture.
They had to know there was one.	Tokko akka jiru beekuu qabu turan.
But that wasn’t the reason.	Garuu sababni sun hin turre.
I still shouldn’t go.	Ammallee deemuu hin qabu.
He had nothing to say.	Inni waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
But even.	Garuu illee.
That was true.	Sun dhugaa ture.
But not anymore.	Garuu kana booda miti.
I won’t be coming here anymore.	Kana booda as hin dhufu.
She had no idea what to do about that.	Waa'ee sanaa maal akka godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
He can’t seem to help himself.	Of gargaaruu waan hin dandeenye fakkaata.
It shouldn't be necessary.	Barbaachisaa ta'uu hin qabu.
They will come.	Isaan ni dhufu.
Very large room.	Kutaa baayyee guddaa.
I’m really happy for you, when you need me.	Dhuguma sitti gammadeera, yeroo ati na barbaaddu.
He was great.	Inni guddaa ture.
I still wonder why it happened at the time.	Ammallee yeroo sanatti maaliif ta'e jedheen yaada.
You're good at it.	Ati irratti ga'umsa qabda.
I think this is my favorite moment of her season.	Yeroon kun bara ishee baay'ee jaalladhu natti fakkaata.
I love one.	Tokko nan jaalladha.
It’s not his house.	Mana isaa miti.
He really loves you.	Dhuguma si jaallata.
I think of a lot of things to do this thing.	Waan kana akka hojjetu waan baay'een yaada.
I didn’t want her.	Ani ishee hin barbaanne.
They always want one to be good.	Yeroo hundumaa tokko gaarii akka ta’u barbaadu.
It took a little while.	Yeroo xiqqoo fudhate.
So what again.	Kanaaf ammas maal ta'a.
And now it was time to do something.	Ammas yeroon waan tokko hojjechuuf ture.
He knew too much.	Inni baay'ee beeka ture.
In the old days they were all on it.	Bara durii hundi isaanii irra turan.
But I thought nothing of it at the time.	Garuu yeroo sanatti homaa itti hin yaadne.
Real place, real time.	Bakka dhugaa, yeroo dhugaa.
He should have known better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
That shouldn't have happened.	Silaa akkas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
I was important out there.	Ani achi keessaa barbaachisaa ture.
She was obviously looking for someone.	Nama barbaadaa akka turte ifaadha.
But that didn’t happen.	Garuu sun hin taane.
Only, that's not it.	Qofa, kana miti.
I have nothing else to say.	Waan biraa jedhu hin qabu.
There is none here.	Asitti tokkollee hin jiru.
But not much.	Garuu baay'ee miti.
I love him, I love him.	Ani isa jaalladha.
He didn't tell anyone what happened.	Waan ta'e namatti hin himne.
Nothing just comes up.	Homaa hin dhufu qofa.
But that’s not what’s important here.	Asitti garuu wanti barbaachisaa ta’e kanuma miti.
It could have been us.	Silaa nu ta'uu danda'a ture.
But I didn't go.	Ani garuu hin deemne.
That was very important.	Sun baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
It’s working well now.	Amma akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
It has been in my house.	Mana koo keessa tureera.
Wait for your watch.	Eegaa sa'aatii keessan.
It has a problem.	Rakkoo qaba.
But three were right.	Garuu sadii sirrii turan.
But, it happened.	Garuu, ta'e.
You have a lot in common with them.	Isaan waliin waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu qabda.
I don’t think it helps me.	Naaf gargaaru natti hin fakkaatu.
People loved it.	Namoonni ni jaallatu turan.
They had everything.	Waan hundumaa qaban turan.
You're the only one.	Ati qofa.
He is the and the.	Inni kan fi kan.
It was something I would have to ask her about later.	Waan booda ishee gaafachuu qabu ture.
Everyone knows about them.	Waa'ee isaanii namni hundi ni beeka.
He was more real than you.	Inni si caalaa dhugaa ture.
He tried again.	Ammas yaale.
I was before him.	Ani isa dura ture.
I wasn’t going to do it though.	Ani garuu gochuuf hin turre.
Hope.	Abdii.
It was very good for me.	Baayyee gaarii naaf ture.
Someone said he wanted my room.	Namni tokko kutaa koo barbaada jedhe.
That wouldn’t work very well here.	Sun asitti baay’ee hin hojjetu ture.
I'm sure it was great.	Guddaa akka ture mirkanaa'adha.
But it has a long way to go.	Garuu karaa dheeraa qaba.
It was a picture.	Suuraa ture.
You could have done it.	Ni dandeessa turte.
So we don’t do that.	Kanaaf akkas hin goonu.
It won't be a problem.	Rakkoo hin ta'u.
The obvious truth.	Dhugaa ifa ta'e.
He couldn’t make a mistake.	Dogoggora hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
It started very well.	Baayyee gaarii jalqabe.
I love my father.	Abbaa koo nan jaalladha.
She’s always been like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas turte.
He doesn't know he's different.	Inni adda ta'uu hin beeku.
You know what it's about.	Waa'ee maal akka ta'e beekta.
I know better now, of course.	Amma caalaatti beeka, beekamaadha.
I had better not know.	Osoo hin beekne wayya ture.
But he wasn’t home.	Garuu mana hin turre.
That’s exactly what’s wrong.	Sirriitti waan hin taane kanuma.
So far this is working for us.	Hanga ammaatti kun nuuf hojjechaa jira.
But that’s not the worst part.	Garuu sun waan hunda caalaa hamaa miti.
But this is still not enough.	Garuu kun ammallee gahaa miti.
He was looking for his father.	Abbaa isaa barbaadaa ture.
He just didn’t do it this year.	Bara kana qofa hin goone.
I am not a bad person.	Ani nama hamaa miti.
What should we do, what should we do.	Maal gochuu qabna, maal gochuu qabna.
I can't live in that.	Sana keessa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
You will love this stuff.	Waan kana ni jaallattu.
This is not something that happens.	Kun waan ta'u miti.
On his condition.	Haala isaa irratti.
To help me out.	Na gargaaruuf.
It’s definitely outdated.	Yeroon isaa yeroon isaa darbe beekamaadha.
Everything we need.	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda.
It has a lot of emotions.	Miira baay'ee qaba.
Go to the dog.	Saree deemaa.
He could always have.	Yeroo hundumaa qabaachuu danda'a ture.
It’s not my favorite thing.	Wanti ani jaalladhu miti.
This is very dangerous.	Kun balaa guddaa qaba.
You can't do that very often.	Yeroo baayyee akkas gochuu hin dandeessu.
This was all in your imagination.	Kun hundi yaada keessan ture.
That was probably my biggest mistake.	Dogoggora koo isa guddaa sun taʼuu hin oolu.
You shouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabdu turte.
I just have some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko qofa qaba.
Except that he knew it was.	Akka ta'e beekuu isaa malee.
That doesn’t seem necessary here.	Asitti sun barbaachisaa hin fakkaatu.
It was nothing to him.	Isaaf homaa hin turre.
You have to help him.	Isa gargaaruu qabda.
People are people.	Namoonni namoota.
But not here.	Asitti garuu miti.
He is here now.	Amma as jira.
Only for a short time.	Yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
But he can have it.	Garuu qabaachuu danda'a.
You can't tell about that.	Waa'ee sanaa himuu hin dandeessu.
It still doesn't work.	Ammas hin hojjetu.
Now I like this much better.	Amma kun baayyee caalaa natti tola.
Join us for the journey.	Nu waliin ta'aa.
Like a mother.	Akkuma haadha.
You need to see it.	Arguu si barbaachisa.
But no one spoke.	Garuu namni dubbate hin jiru.
One problem, thought.	Rakkoo tokko, yaada.
She has no other.	Kan biraa hin qabdu.
The most important thing is people.	Wanti hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e nama.
You can even make another one.	Kan biraa illee hojjechuu dandeessa.
I mean a lot.	Baay'ee jechuu kooti.
It’s most definitely happening.	Inni hunda caalaa mirkanaa’aa ta’ee ta’aa jira.
It has a long enough name as it does.	Maqaa dheeraa gahaa akkuma qabu qaba.
That thing had him.	Wanti sun isa qaba ture.
He needs someone to do that for him.	Nama akkas isaaf godhu isa barbaachisa.
You can even scream.	Iyyuu dandeessa.
Your wholeness.	Guutuu keessan.
You don’t know it exists anymore.	Kana booda akka jiru hin beektu.
Boy, of course.	Gurbaa, beekamaadha.
This was a real thing.	Kun waan dhugaa ture.
But he needed more.	Garuu kana caalaa isa barbaachisa ture.
It still seemed outdated.	Ammas waan yeroon isaa darbe fakkaata ture.
He thought that was a good idea.	Sun yaada gaarii itti fakkaate.
But maybe not.	Tarii garuu hin ta'u ta'a.
It really wasn’t the man’s problem.	Dhuguma rakkoon nama sana hin turre.
But she didn’t have that much time.	Garuu yeroo hamma kanaa hin qabdu turte.
None of us ever have.	Tokkollee keenya gonkumaa hin qabu.
You were in it.	Ati keessa turte.
So we’re looking at it.	Kanaaf ilaalaa jirra.
Not that they have much.	Waan baay'ee qaban jechuu miti.
Everything you need.	Waan isin barbaachisu hunda.
Really love it.	Dhuguma jaalladhu.
For that to happen, they have to believe in themselves.	Sun akka ta’uuf ofitti amanuu qabu.
Who knows how he got there.	Akkamitti akka achitti dhufe eenyutu beeka.
I knew what was happening then.	Yeroo sanatti waan ta'aa jiru nan beeka ture.
But no one knows.	Garuu namni beeku hin jiru.
I could never be.	Ani gonkumaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
You can have your time to go now.	Yeroo kee amma deemuuf qabaachuu dandeessa.
Maybe I couldn't talk to you.	Tarii sitti dubbachuu hin dandeenye ta'a.
But that doesn't mean much.	Garuu sun waan baay'ee jechuu miti.
But they are wrong.	Isaan garuu dogoggora qabu.
Great, right there.	Guddaa, sirriitti achitti.
It’s not a job anymore.	Kana booda hojii miti.
He spoke again.	Ammas dubbate.
He was in a terrible state.	Haala hamaa keessa ture.
Not talking about it much.	Waa'ee isaa baay'ee dubbachuu miti.
But it really didn’t matter.	Dhuguma garuu homaa hin turre.
I didn’t really think about it.	Dhuguma itti hin yaadne.
Hope it eats, but who knows what else.	Abdii nyaata, garuu eenyutu beeka maal biraa.
There is only one.	Kan jiru tokko qofa.
But it takes a lot of hands.	Garuu harka baay'ee barbaada.
Was that or just didn't want him around.	Sana ture moo qofa naannoo isaa hin barbaanne.
It happens for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
I know you better than you know yourself.	Ati of beektu caalaa ani si beeka.
This, of course, is not the case at all.	Kun, tasumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That was two months ago.	Sun ji'a lama dura ture.
They knew this was it.	Kun akka ta'e ni beeku turan.
But that was one thing.	Garuu sun waan tokko ture.
I knew that.	Kana nan beeka ture.
If he ever does.	Yoom iyyuu yoo godhe.
He didn't talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa hin dubbanne.
You guys are good.	Isin gaarii dha.
None of that is true.	Sana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa miti.
Now you are there.	Amma ati jirtu.
No one wanted to do anything.	Namni tokkollee homaa gochuu hin barbaanne.
But you have to make a living for yourself, my boy.	Garuu jireenya ofii hojjechuu qabda gurbaa koo.
But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti hin jiru jechuu miti.
Really bad idea.	Dhuguma yaada hamaa.
Now there was no one else on the road.	Amma namni biraa karaa irra hin turre.
I certainly couldn’t do anything about it.	Ani homaa gochuu akkan hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Tarii boru ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
What more he was alone again.	Maal caalaa ammas kophaa isaa ture.
People want to know what it is.	Namoonni maal akka ta'e beekuu barbaadu.
I'll look for you tomorrow.	Boru si barbaada.
Then, there’s the problem.	Sana booda, rakkoon jira.
What will they be.	Maal ta'u.
Some good ideas.	Yaada gaarii tokko tokko.
But timing was everything.	Yeroon garuu waan hunda ture.
She had to see him.	Isa arguu qabdi turte.
It wasn't so right.	Akkas sirrii hin turre.
Never around when you need him.	Yeroo isa barbaaddu gonkumaa naannoo hin taane.
It was the absolute truth.	Dhugaa guutuu ture.
The very best of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee gaarii.
You have your time.	Yeroo kee qabda.
I think we have a lot going for us.	Waan baay'ee nuuf deemaa jiru natti fakkaata.
No one likes it too much.	Namni garmalee jaallatu hin jiru.
That was her age.	Umuriin ishee akkas ture.
Our new life.	Jireenya keenya haaraa.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
Not even him.	Isa illee miti.
Bigger than a book.	Kitaaba caalaa guddaa.
Most of the time, it seems, it wasn’t.	Yeroo baay’ee, akkas hin turre fakkaata.
It has something you love.	Waan ati jaallattu qaba.
I started asking them.	Anis isaan gaafachuu jalqabe.
I just can't do it like that.	Ani akkasitti hojjechuu qofa hin danda'u.
I can do a lot with this.	Kanaan waan baay'ee hojjechuu nan danda'a.
But he could do it.	Garuu ni danda'a ture.
That, however, is not going to be the issue here.	Sun garuu dhimma asitti hin deemu.
It doesn’t mean it’s not good.	Gaarii miti jechuu miti.
I wondered what had happened.	Maaltu ta'e jedheen yaade.
We didn’t do that.	Nuti akkas hin goone.
I have no idea what he’s doing.	Waan inni hojjetu yaada hin qabu.
This should help with both things.	Kun waan lamaan gargaaruu qaba.
This would be a terrible thing.	Kun waan hamaa ta'a.
It’s my duty.	Dirqama kooti.
Everyone already knows about this one.	Waa'ee isa kanaa namni hundi duruu beeka.
It really does work.	Dhuguma hojii hojjeta.
I might say too much.	Garmalee jechuu danda'a.
I would be.	Ani ta'a.
But we had to see it coming.	Garuu dhufuu isaa arguu qabna turre.
That’s my daughter.	Sun intala kooti.
That’s not always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin ta’u.
But this is not the case at all.	Garuu kun tasumaa akkas miti.
Perhaps she was.	Tarii isheen turte taʼa.
Throughout this year.	Waggaa kana guutuu.
He bought me a lot of things.	Waan hedduu naaf bite.
It wasn't right, he thought.	Sirrii hin turre jedhee yaade.
He was still there.	Ammas achi ture.
But that is not necessarily the case.	Garuu dirqama akkas miti.
These are the ones.	Isaan kun.
It was great!.	Guddaa ture!.
Sorry about this afternoon.	Waa'ee har'a waaree booda dhiifama.
There must be something we can do.	Waan gochuu dandeenyu jiraachuu qaba.
From your hands to mine.	Harka kee irraa gara kootti.
We wanted to be with you.	Si waliin ta'uu barbaanne.
It’s really really important.	Dhuguma dhuguma barbaachisaa dha.
Something happened in you.	Waan tokko si keessatti ta'e.
There wasn’t one.	Tokkollee hin turre.
I could get my thing.	Waan koo argachuu nan danda'a ture.
We need pictures.	Suuraa nu barbaachisa.
It was his, now.	Kan isaa ture, amma.
I wanted to be him.	Isa ta'uu barbaade.
It was all she could do.	Wanti isheen gochuu dandeessu qofa ture.
But I was happy this time, really.	Garuu yeroo kana gammade, dhuguma.
It looks a lot, it looks very good.	Baayyee fakkaata, baayyee gaarii fakkaata.
It was something he hadn’t seen before.	Kan inni kanaan dura hin argine ture.
Perhaps he was older than he looked.	Tarii inni fakkaatu caalaa umuriin isaa guddaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
I thought it was more than that.	Kana caalaa natti fakkaate.
Someone says something important.	Namni tokko waan barbaachisaa tokko dubbata.
I am just one person.	Ani nama tokko qofa.
Tell me now.	Amma natti himi.
He didn't want her.	Ishee hin barbaanne.
I have the time and money now.	Yeroo fi maallaqa amma qaba.
They could walk down the street.	Karaa irra deemuu danda'u turan.
We need to play better than that.	Kana caalaa taphachuu qabna.
I don't know you.	Ani si hin beeku.
He wasn’t looking at me.	Inni na ilaalaa hin turre.
I'm sure of it.	Ani mirkanaa'aa dha.
I don’t want to help him.	Isa gargaaruu hin barbaadu.
I would have done it.	Silaa nan godha ture.
Must.	Dirqama.
Great job, as always!.	Hojii guddaa, akkuma yeroo hunda!.
No one is around tonight.	Halkan kana namni naannoo hin jiru.
I have a problem with that part.	Kutaa sana irratti rakkoon qaba.
But maybe that wasn't the case.	Tarii garuu akkas hin turre ta'a.
There is no problem.	Rakkoon hin jiru.
You might still wonder what we were doing.	Ammallee maal hojjechaa turre jettanii yaaddu taʼa.
I had no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
Then who knows.	Sana booda eenyutu beeka.
Look at that.	Sana ilaalaa.
Many are never the same.	Baay’een isaanii gonkumaa tokko miti.
I can't help it.	Ani gargaaruu hin danda'u.
But then there she was again.	Garuu sana booda ammas achi turte.
But you can’t know.	Garuu beekuu hin dandeessu.
She was wrong.	Dogoggora turte.
I would go further.	Kana caalaa nan deema ture.
We can be exactly like them.	Nuti sirriitti akkuma isaanii ta'uu danda'a.
He wouldn't go.	Hin deemu ture.
I still wasn't sure who that was.	Ammallee sun eenyu akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
But it doesn't, it never has.	Garuu hin ta'u, ta'ee hin beeku.
Otherwise you will never see it.	Yoo kana hin taane gonkumaa arguu hin dandeessu.
I don't know what to do.	Waan godhu hin beeku.
This is really something.	Kun dhuguma waan tokko.
I don’t know what else to do.	Kana booda maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
I'd rather talk about you.	Waa'ee kee dubbachuu naaf wayya.
It was just this sound.	Sagalee kana qofa ture.
I was the only person inside.	Nama keessa jiru ana qofa ture.
It must be something.	Waan tokko ta'uu qaba.
He can see what they don't.	Waan isaan hin argine arguu danda'a.
It was just luck.	Carraa qofa ture.
It was nothing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti homaa hin turre.
I really want to work with them now.	Amma isaan waliin hojjechuu baay'een barbaada.
We have to go now.	Amma deemuu qabna.
The cat eats the cat.	Saree nyaata saree.
. . . .	.
She was in her car.	Konkolaataa ishee keessa turte.
I don’t have that feeling anymore.	Kana booda miira sana hin qabu.
I didn’t see the light.	Ifa hin argine.
What does he know.	Maal beeka.
We were good to go.	Deemuuf gaarii turre.
It happens for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
It would have never happened.	Silaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
Everything is exactly the same.	Wanti hundi sirriitti wal fakkaata.
Now look at it.	Amma ilaalaa.
Not sure why.	Maaliif akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
It wasn’t what he wanted.	Waan inni barbaadu hin turre.
You wouldn’t be there.	Ati hin jirtu turte.
Tell me about your career.	Waa'ee hojii kee natti himi.
It’s a good opportunity.	Carraa gaarii dha.
I can't make myself clear.	Of ifa gochuu hin danda'u.
He was in a mood.	Miira keessa ture.
It can’t be anything else.	Waan biraa ta’uu hin danda’u.
We need to work together.	Waliin hojjechuu qabna.
Perhaps that is the case.	Tarii akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
I'm going with you.	Si waliin deemaa jira.
He didn’t want her to be in danger.	Balaa keessa akka jirtu hin barbaanne ture.
It was always like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'a ture.
You're not even from here.	Ati as irraa illee miti.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
This was no time to joke.	Yeroon kun yeroo itti qoosaa hin turre.
There is no problem.	Rakkoon hin jiru.
It becomes a problem.	Rakkoo ta'a.
I don't think it's anything else.	Waan biraa natti hin fakkaatu.
You know from what we were doing, we were having a great time.	Waan hojjechaa turre irraa beekta, yeroo guddaa turre.
They still have to play us next year.	Ammas bara dhufu nu taphachuu qabu.
But we are never alone, not really.	Garuu gonkumaa kophaa keenya miti, dhuguma miti.
I will never go anywhere else.	Ani gonkumaa bakka biraa hin deemu.
We should have known better.	Silaa caalaatti beekuu qabna turre.
I wonder if this is going to work.	Kun hojjechuuf jiraa jedheen yaada.
They do the job better than they should.	Waan hojjechuu qaban caalaa hojii sana hojjetu.
Her favorite foods.	Nyaata isheen jaallattu.
That's about it.	Waa'ee isaa kana.
But there is no need to do this.	Garuu kana gochuun hin barbaachisu.
But that wasn’t bad.	Garuu sun hamaa hin turre.
But now I like it.	Amma garuu natti tola.
I know where you’re going.	Eessa akka deemtu nan beeka.
It is never necessary.	Gonkumaa hin barbaachisu.
Could someone have done something.	Namni tokko waan tokko gochuu danda'a turee.
Which you are.	Kan ati taate.
It took some time.	Yeroo muraasa fudhate.
I have a lot of stuff to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu baay'een qaba.
He is so right.	Inni akkas sirrii dha.
I like it.	Natti tola.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
I couldn’t see that way.	Karaa sana arguu hin dandeenye.
Just like when we were kids.	Akkuma yeroo ijoollee turre.
Now.	Amma.
If so, it worked.	Yoo akkas ta'e ni hojjete.
That has them.	Sun isaan qaba.
We don't have time for it.	Yeroo itti hin qabnu.
Everything is in there.	Wanti hundi achi keessa jira.
Much more than that.	Baay'ee caalaa.
So no one was looking for him.	Kanaaf namni isa barbaadu hin turre.
Now everything was clear.	Amma wanti hundi ifa ta'e.
But it’s completely different.	Garuu guutummaatti adda.
She was more real to me than myself.	Isheen ofii koo caalaa dhugaa naaf turte.
I'm not going to go.	Ani hin deemu.
But he didn't need it.	Garuu isa hin barbaachifne.
He is not a bad man.	Nama hamaa miti.
Money, money, money.	Maallaqa, maallaqa, maallaqa.
He’s onto something.	Inni waan tokko irra jira.
He would never do it.	Inni gonkumaa hin godhu ture.
Then it will be now again.	Sana booda ammas amma ta'a.
They were human beings.	Isaan nama turan.
I couldn’t have done it otherwise.	Silaa akkas ta’ee gochuu hin danda’u ture.
Please check us out!.	Mee nu ilaalaa!.
He knew what he needed.	Waan isa barbaachisu ni beeka ture.
He needs your help.	Gargaarsa keessan isa barbaada.
But more than nothing.	Garuu homaa hin taane caalaa.
But I couldn’t find it.	Garuu ani argachuu hin dandeenye.
Like, really late.	Akka, dhuguma booda.
The hour of the day.	Sa'aatii guyyaa sanaa.
I think that’s a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
He may be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
Therefore, from	Kanaaf, irraa .
I am not that girl.	Ani intala sana miti.
One said he could do nothing about it.	Tokko homaa gochuu akka hin dandeenye dubbateera.
What you think you should do.	Waan gochuu qabda jettee yaaddu.
He knew it perfectly.	Inni guutummaatti beeka ture.
He seemed to be searching for something.	Waan tokko waan barbaadaa jiru fakkaata ture.
But for two reasons.	Garuu sababa lama.
But he wouldn't tell, not yet.	Garuu hin himu ture, ammallee miti.
You can't do it.	Ati hin dandeessu.
I can't help you.	Si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
It was pretty funny to me.	Natti baay'ee qoosaa ture.
I didn’t want them this time.	Yeroo kana isaan hin barbaanne.
I think that would be a lot.	Sun waan baay'ee ta'a jedheen yaada.
He saw himself.	Of arge.
These are really good ones.	Isaan kun dhuguma warra gaarii dha.
It's going now.	Amma deemaa jira.
I didn’t know them.	Isaan hin beeku ture.
I still can't believe someone would do that.	Ammallee namni tokko akkas godha jedhee amanuu hin danda'u.
Even his own.	Kan isaa illee.
It can be a problem.	Rakkoo ta'uu danda'a.
Maybe it's luck.	Tarii carraa ta'uu danda'a.
Complete trilingual.	Guutuu afaan sadii.
She is not one of them.	Isheen isaan keessaa tokko miti.
If the.	Yoo kan.
But it wasn’t.	Garuu hin turre.
I really didn't know what it was, but it was more than that.	Dhuguma maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture, garuu kana caalaa.
I'm just like you.	Anis akkuma kee.
They are just there.	Isaan achi qofa jiru.
If not now, when?.	Yoo amma hin taane yoom?.
He must just be playing with me.	Inni na waliin taphachuu qofa ta'uu qaba.
When everything went wrong.	Yeroo wanti hundi itti dogoggora ta'e.
I have something.	Ani waan tokko qaba.
Just one problem.	Rakkoo tokko qofa.
Anything could have happened.	Wanti hundi taʼuu dandaʼa ture.
Now things are different.	Amma wanti jiru adda.
There was hope for us.	Abdiin nuuf ture.
Clearly, he really was.	Dhuguma akka ture ifaadha.
That made his day.	Sun guyyaa isaa godhe.
I had no idea what to say.	Maal akka jedhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
But it wasn’t for him.	Isaaf garuu hin turre.
They are good people.	Isaan namoota gaarii dha.
I don’t think she has.	Isheen waan qabdu natti hin fakkaatu.
Perhaps he came that morning.	Tarii ganama sana dhufe taʼa.
People like us.	Namoonni akka keenya.
More than that, please.	Kana caalaa maaloo.
I have no hope.	Abdii hin qabu.
You know everything.	Waan hundumaa ni beekta.
But it wasn’t everything.	Garuu waan hunda hin turre.
But only one thought.	Garuu yaada tokko qofa.
No one else knows about such things.	Waa'ee wantoota akkasii namni biraa hin beeku.
He did that very few times.	Yeroo baayyee muraasa akkas godhe.
But he didn't want to.	Garuu hin barbaanne.
I know it’s not that easy a task.	Hojii hangas salphaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
I do that a lot.	Ani baay'een akkas godha.
But 'this' was bad.	Garuu 'kun' hamaa ture.
Loud noise in that place.	Sagalee guddaa bakka sanatti.
We really don’t have time to stay any longer.	Dhuguma kana booda turuuf yeroo hin qabnu.
This was pretty bad.	Kun baayyee hamaa ture.
Might.	Tarii.
I said it was fine.	Anis gaarii jedheen.
It doesn't seem like anything.	Homaa hin fakkaatu.
This was all wrong.	Kun hundi dogoggora ture.
He didn’t say anything about that.	Sana irratti homaa hin dubbanne.
She has a daughter.	Intala tokko qabdi.
This is a sound.	Kun sagalee dha.
I'm not so sure anymore.	Kana booda akkasitti mirkanaa'aa miti.
Of course you can.	Akka dandeessu beekamaadha.
We are there.	Achi jirra.
This was often not the case.	Yeroo baayʼee kun akkas hin turre.
At the right time.	Yeroo sirriitti.
I think this could be an issue.	Kun dhimma ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada.
No problem.	Rakkoo hin qabu.
It doesn’t seem to matter.	Dhimma waan qabu hin fakkaatu.
No one had anything to say.	Namni waan jedhu hin qabu ture.
It's better not to talk too much.	Baay'ee dubbachuu dhiisuu wayya.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
It shouldn't be.	Ta'uu hin qabu.
But they don’t have a problem.	Garuu isaan rakkoo hin qaban.
Not that there’s a problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoon jira jechuu miti.
I think you're right.	Ati sirrii natti fakkaata.
You are truly unique.	Dhuguma ati adda taate.
I'm still watching though.	Ammas ilaalaa jira garuu.
It took a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
We all have them.	Hundi keenya isaan qabna.
She has to do this.	Kana gochuu qabdi.
But that was completely different.	Garuu sun guutummaatti adda ture.
As she must.	Akkuma isheen dirqama.
I know he will do it.	Akka inni godhu nan beeka.
But there will be something.	Garuu waan tokko ni jiraata.
Out.	Ala.
But who knows.	Garuu eenyutu beeka.
He had everything.	Waan hundumaa qaba ture.
Maybe in a year, it will be.	Tarii waggaa tokko booda, ni jiraata.
Then it went further.	Sana booda kana caalaa deeme.
I certainly do.	Ani akkan godhu beekamaadha.
My real job.	Hojii koo isa dhugaa.
It is more important than life itself.	Jireenya ofii caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
Very good indeed.	Dhuguma baayyee gaarii dha.
This is not true.	Kun dhugaa miti.
I thought that was a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii natti fakkaate.
That’s a really good thing.	Sun dhuguma waan gaarii dha.
You need it when you need it.	Yeroo barbaaddu si barbaachisa.
Now there are two ways to play it.	Amma karaa lama itti taphachuu dandeenyu jira.
I still don’t know who she is.	Ammallee eenyu akka taate hin beeku.
This is not the case now.	Kun amma miti.
That's all it would be.	Kana qofa ta'a ture.
Then it worked.	Sana booda hojjete.
I don't know about myself.	Waa'ee koo hin beeku.
That would have been nice.	Silaa sun gaarii ture.
Home.	Mana.
It was such a place.	Bakka akkasii ture.
We have good things about this.	Waa'ee kanaa waan gaarii qabna.
You are a mother.	Ati haadha.
No one else can do it.	Namni biraa gochuu hin danda'u.
It should have been something completely different.	Silaa waan guutummaatti adda ta'e ta'uu qaba ture.
This seemed to be more about the cat.	Kun waa'ee saree caalaa waan ta'e fakkaata ture.
They know it doesn’t work.	Akka hin hojjenne ni beeku.
We didn’t talk like that.	Akkasitti wal hin dubbanne.
She is not yours.	Isheen kan kee miti.
So that's a good thing.	Kanaaf waan gaarii.
Everyone loves money.	Namni hundi maallaqa ni jaallata.
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
I didn’t understand.	Hin hubanne.
He has been good to me.	Inni gaarii naaf ta'ee jira.
The way they go.	Karaa itti deemu.
That's why she said it.	Kanaaf jette.
A name he didn't know.	Maqaa inni hin beekne.
It's really very nice.	Dhuguma baayyee namatti tola.
She doesn't have a car.	Konkolaataa hin qabdu.
How did this happen? 	Kun akkamitti taʼe?
Speaking in a good voice.	Sagalee gaarii dubbachuu.
It was that simple.	Akkas salphaa ture.
Now he had her.	Amma ishee qaba ture.
I don’t know those people.	Namoota sana hin beeku.
It had to be someone else.	Nama biraa ta'uu qaba ture.
This should have been easy.	Kun salphaa ta'uu qaba ture.
We have to play well.	Akka gaariitti taphachuu qabna.
He did it so badly.	Akka malee hamaa godhe.
I'm thinking about it.	Ani itti yaada.
We should have just left it there.	Silaa achitti dhiisuu qofa qabna turre.
Once, maybe she had.	Yeroo tokko, tarii qabdi turte.
Now you can get around to it.	Amma naannoo isaa argachuu dandeessu.
This, however, is still not accurate enough.	Kun garuu ammallee sirrii gahaa miti.
Which obviously doesn’t work.	Kan akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
I looked at the guy up the road.	Gurbaa karaa ol jiru sana ilaale.
But only for a moment.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf qofa.
Check it out on	Irratti ilaalaa .
No one could.	Namni tokkollee hin dandeenye.
I could be wrong about this.	Kana irratti dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
We've been easy to work with.	Hojjechuuf salphaa ta'ee turre.
There are still people.	Ammas namoonni jiru.
Good luck.	Carraa gaarii.
But very few of them.	Garuu isaan keessaa baayyee muraasa.
It was our day.	Guyyaa keenya ture.
I don’t know what you mean.	Maal jechuu akka barbaaddu hin beeku.
They love it.	Ni jaallatu.
We can’t do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
With my wife.	Haadha manaa koo waliin.
Much was clear to him.	Waan baay'een isaaf ifa ture.
Mine was easy.	Kan koo salphaa ture.
What was clear was that she was amused.	Wanti ifa ta'e ishee qoosaa ture.
You are waiting for a place.	Bakka eegaa jirta.
But this was bad.	Garuu kun hamaa ture.
But her.	Garuu ishee.
Not everyone is like that though.	Namni hundi akkas miti garuu.
He rarely does that.	Inni yeroo muraasaaf akkas godhu.
The problem tonight wasn’t his problem.	Rakkoon halkan kana rakkoo isaa hin turre.
I was the only one.	Ani qofa ture.
This had to be true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu qaba ture.
There is nothing else.	Kana malee wanti biraa hin jiru.
But that is not the case now.	Garuu amma akkas miti.
A simple question.	Gaaffii salphaa.
This time no one has an answer.	Yeroo kana namni deebii qabu hin jiru.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Tarii waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu hin barbaanne ta'a.
There is no need to ever do that.	Yoomiyyuu akkas gochuun hin barbaachisu.
You did that to me, before.	Ati akkas na goote, kanaan dura.
A very good book.	Kitaaba baayyee gaarii ta'e.
Let's see how it turned out.	Mee ilaalaa akkamitti akka ta'e.
It was good that he did.	Akkas godhe gaarii ture.
He started yelling at me tonight.	Halkan kana natti iyyuu jalqabe.
I really didn’t want to go.	Dhuguma deemuu hin barbaanne.
Maybe someone who looks like her.	Tarii nama ishee fakkaatu ta'uu danda'a.
Looks like we have it there.	Achitti waan qabnu fakkaata.
You were right.	Ati sirrii turte.
He had a good handle, it was a good day.	Qabduu gaarii qaba ture, guyyaa gaarii ture.
He should have known that.	Silaa sana beekuu qaba ture.
But no one said that.	Garuu namni akkas jedhe hin jiru.
You need a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee si barbaachisa.
You’re looking at him.	Isa ilaalaa jirta.
He wasn’t looking at me anymore.	Kana booda na ilaalaa hin turre.
It was a little different.	Xiqqoo adda ture.
You better know.	Ati beekuu wayya.
I don't know what will help.	Wanti gargaaru hin beeku.
No one was looking for her.	Namni ishee barbaadaa hin turre.
I don't think it will happen.	Ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadu.
Now it's mine.	Amma kan kooti.
People just weren’t into that.	Namoonni akkas keessa hin turre qofa.
It matters.	Dhimma qaba.
I love him very much.	Ani baay'een isa jaalladha.
But it doesn't happen!.	Garuu hin ta'u!.
Then another after that.	Sana booda kan biraa sana booda.
But everything else is completely different.	Garuu wanti biraa hundi guutummaatti adda.
I need to do that for me.	Sana naaf gochuu barbaachisa.
It can't be a girl.	Intala ta'uu hin danda'u.
They do that the whole time.	Yeroo guutuu akkas ni godhu.
That's going to be huge.	Sun guddaa ta'uuf deema.
That's all that happens.	Kan ta'u kanuma qofa.
I can't give you an answer on that.	Sana irratti deebii siif kennuu hin danda'u.
Not an exaggeration.	Garmalee dubbachuu miti.
I will definitely go with you.	Si waliin akkan deemu beekamaadha.
I'll be him.	Ani isa ta'a.
It didn't seem to be her business.	Dhimma ishee waan ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
Something very important.	Waan baayyee barbaachisaa ta'e tokko.
I want a little something.	Waan xiqqoo nan barbaada.
That sounds like a lot.	Sun waan baay'ee fakkaata.
I had no idea what to do.	Maal akka godhu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It’s a great thing.	Waan guddaa.
He should have been here.	Silaa as jiraachuu qaba ture.
Lots of good food.	Nyaata gaarii baay'ee.
I was the one who found her.	Kan ishee argate ana ture.
That was certainly the case.	Akkas akka ture beekamaadha.
I just need his luck.	Carraa isaa qofa na barbaachisa.
He was no longer human.	Kana booda nama hin turre.
A great teacher.	Barsiisaa guddaa.
If he was around long enough.	Yoo yeroo dheeraa gahaa naannoo sana ture.
I have a great forgiveness.	Dhiifama guddaa qaba.
Everything is there.	Wanti hundi achi jira.
He wanted to see her.	Ishee arguu barbaade.
I know him so well.	Ani akka malee sirriitti isa beeka.
I am a mother.	Ani haadha.
In that case,.	Haala sana keessatti,.
So it’s not just about doing it.	Kanaaf gochuu qofa miti.
He was my father.	Inni abbaa koo ture.
She didn’t, she really didn’t.	Isheen hin goone, dhuguma hin goone.
This may be true.	Kun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
This was the case.	Kun ture.
Such a great passion.	Fedhii guddaa akkasii.
You are mine.	Ati kan kooti.
I'll go somewhere else.	Bakka biraa nan deema.
He had no idea where he was going.	Eessa akka deemu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
We are not good enough for you.	Nuti siif gaarii miti.
But that time is no more.	Yeroon sun garuu kana booda hin jiru.
We have a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa qabna.
Perhaps he could earn this.	Tarii kana argachuu dandaʼa ture.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
No more of this old stuff.	Kana booda waan durii kana hin jiru.
You don’t have to do this.	Kana gochuun dirqama miti.
But of course, that’s just me.	Garuu beekamaadha, sun ana qofa.
Someone else has seen this.	Namni biraa kana arge jira.
They work with me.	Ana waliin hojjetu.
If they weren’t, they would go.	Osoo hin taane ni deemu turan.
This time you have a chance.	Yeroo kana carraa qabda.
It was so obvious at the time.	Yeroo sanatti akka malee ifa ture.
He was a nice guy.	Inni namatti tola ture.
I like this extremely well.	Kun garmalee natti tola.
Maybe better than she knows herself.	Tarii isheen of beektu caalaa gaarii ta'a.
That’s important.	Sun barbaachisaa dha.
After a while no one wanted to talk about it.	Yeroo muraasa booda namni waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu barbaade hin jiru.
But then, he would.	Garuu sana booda, ni godha ture.
There is no one like him.	Namni akka inni fakkaatu hin jiru.
We couldn’t have done it without all of you.	Osoo hunda keessan hin taane gochuu hin dandeenyu ture.
Your hope has to be there.	Abdiin kee achi jiraachuu qaba.
But it's me.	Garuu ana.
Which is working for me.	Kan naaf hojjechaa jiru.
Same exact issue.	Dhimma sirrii wal fakkaatu.
I am there for him.	Ani isaaf jira.
Otherwise it won't happen.	Yoo kana hin taane hin ta'u.
But, he has some things working for him.	Garuu, waan tokko tokko isaaf hojjetu qaba.
No one spoke to her at all.	Namni tasumaa ishee waliin dubbate hin turre.
No one wanted them.	Namni isaan barbaade hin jiru.
That's it.	Kanuma.
I would go instead.	Bakka isaa nan deema ture.
We were with you the whole way.	Karaa guutuu isin waliin turre.
But if that is not the case.	Garuu yoo akkas hin taane.
And I went to it.	Anis itti deeme.
That I just couldn’t make myself.	Akkan of gochuu qofa hin dandeenye.
They work together from now on.	Ammaa booda waliin hojjetu.
Look at that day.	Guyyaa sana ilaalaa.
I think it's about right.	Waa'ee sirrii natti fakkaata.
I really wanted to go this year.	Bara kana deemuu baay'een barbaade.
She is not your mother.	Isheen haadha kee miti.
We can’t say that.	Kana jechuu hin dandeenyu.
He just knows.	Inni qofa beeka.
He didn’t have any eyes.	Ija tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I didn’t make her think that.	Akkas akka yaaddu waanan godhe hin turre.
If she is home.	Yoo isheen mana taate.
You are here with me.	Ati as na waliin jirta.
I have a job.	Hojiin qaba.
People want all the same houses.	Namoonni mana hunda wal fakkaatu barbaadu.
There was always someone else there.	Yeroo hundumaa namni biraa achi ture.
I want to know what happened.	Waan taʼe beekuu nan barbaada.
But he wants her to know what's going to happen.	Garuu waan ta'uuf jiru akka isheen beektu barbaada.
They should live a good life.	Jireenya gaarii jiraachuu qabu.
She's not me.	Isheen ana miti.
I'll be looking for it soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti barbaada.
It’s all his own.	Hundi isaa kan isaa.
Before your time, of course.	Yeroo keessan dura, beekamaadha.
The one that works.	Kan hojjetu.
It could have been though.	Silaa ta'uu danda'a ture garuu.
But two things are clear.	Garuu wanti lama ifaadha.
Except that it's true.	Dhugaa ta'uu isaa malee.
He has a desire.	Fedhii qaba.
It really wasn’t that bad.	Dhuguma akkas hamaa hin turre.
But of course it didn’t matter.	Garuu beekamaadha homaa hin turre.
No one asked him.	Namni isa gaafate hin jiru.
I just have two questions, really.	Gaaffii lama qofa qaba, dhuguma.
He didn't say her name.	Maqaa ishee hin dubbanne.
But he couldn’t find a job.	Garuu hojii argachuu hin dandeenye.
Very happy so far.	Baayyee gammade hanga ammaatti.
Today was hers.	Har'a kan ishee ture.
He had a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee qaba ture.
There are, however.	Ni jiru garuu.
Sorry.	Dhiifama.
I couldn’t see them.	Isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
I knew someone in a similar situation.	Nama haala wal fakkaatu keessa jiru nan beeka ture.
There were two of them.	Lama turan.
I think it’s clear that he did.	Akka godhe ifa natti fakkaata.
All these dangers.	Balaa kana hunda.
I can't tell you what.	Maal sitti himuu hin danda'u.
I'm not entirely sure.	Ani guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I'm not doing anything.	Homaa hojjechaa hin jiru.
You are interested.	Fedhii qabda.
No one goes alone.	Namni kophaa isaa hin deemu.
As in you alone.	Akkuma si qofa keessatti.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf si waliin kophaa ta'uu barbaade.
I just don’t want to.	Ani qofa hin barbaadu.
We really don’t care.	Dhuguma dhimma hin qabnu.
I'm sure of that.	Sana mirkanaa'aa dha.
That’s one thing.	Sun waan tokko.
Have.	Qaba.
No one says that.	Namni akkas jedhu hin jiru.
It was a picture.	Suuraa ture.
He asked what had happened.	Maal ta'e jedhee gaafate.
It sounds like a joke.	Qoosaa fakkaata.
He knows some many things and a few well.	Waan hedduu tokko tokko fi muraasa akka gaariitti beeka.
None of this was good.	Kun tokkollee gaarii hin turre.
But it wouldn't have been good enough.	Garuu silaa gaarii hin ta'u ture.
I have no idea what it is.	Maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
He was all of this.	Inni kana hunda ture.
Many.	Hedduu.
I like the question.	Gaaffii natti tola.
That he was in a dangerous job.	Hojii balaa keessa akka ture.
That was a good thing.	Sun waan gaarii ture.
Without each other.	Wal malee.
It obviously consists of two parts.	Kutaa lama akka of keessaa qabu ifaadha.
We have to go.	Deemu qabna.
Don't mother.	Hin haadha.
He made everything he did work for you.	Waan hojjetu hunda akka siif ta'u godhe.
I don’t know any of these people.	Namoota kana keessaa tokkollee hin beeku.
If you do, you couldn't be more wrong.	Yoo akkas goote kana caalaa dogoggora ta'uu hin dandeessu.
I’m not just lucky.	Ani carraa qofa miti.
Together it is very dangerous.	Waliin balaa guddaa qaba.
But nothing is better.	Garuu wanti homaa hin taane wayya.
That would happen tomorrow.	Sun boru ta'a ture.
That's not good.	Sun gaarii miti.
Not that I think it’s a mistake.	Dogoggora jedhee yaadu miti.
That’s their problem.	Rakkoon isaanii kanuma.
But they have to speak up.	Garuu dubbachuu qabu.
Maybe it's him.	Tarii isa ta'uu danda'a.
He just knew he needed one.	Tokko akka isa barbaachisu qofa beeka ture.
None are going home tomorrow.	Boru tokkollee gara manaatti hin deemu.
I knew what he was looking at, looking for.	Waan inni ilaalaa jiru, barbaadaa akka jiru nan beeka ture.
But not everyone can do this.	Garuu namni hundi kana gochuu hin danda'u.
I loved my parents.	Warra koo nan jaalladha ture.
Going for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf deemuun.
It is important to do this.	Kana gochuun barbaachisaa dha.
Year, year, year.	Waggaa, waggaa, waggaa.
But they do it together.	Garuu waliin godhu.
It usually works.	Yeroo baay'ee ni hojjeta.
It’s not helpful.	Gargaarsa miti.
Hands here, mouths there.	Harka asitti, afaan achi.
So it was really good for us.	Kanaaf dhuguma nuuf gaarii ture.
Very different.	Baayyee adda.
But, it wasn’t that bad.	Garuu, hangas hamaa hin turre.
It lasted for hours.	Sa'aatii dheeraaf ture.
It is not necessary.	Barbaachisaa miti.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
Sometimes they come.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni dhufu.
We are absolutely obliged.	Guutummaatti dirqama qabna.
There were two of us.	Lama turre.
I don't have anything.	Homaa hin qabu.
You certainly don’t have to do those things.	Wantoota sana gochuu akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
I don't know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'u hin beeku.
He never said what it was.	Maal akka ta'e gonkumaa hin dubbanne.
I looked up at him.	Anis ol jedheen ilaale.
It wasn’t that long ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura hin turre.
There is a problem.	Rakkoon jira.
It was too much, too soon.	Garmalee, dafee ture.
They were great stuff.	Isaan waan guddaa turan.
I have been there.	Ani achi tureera.
He was helpless.	Gargaarsa hin qabu ture.
But it’s not without risk.	Garuu balaa malee miti.
This time it was a bit different.	Yeroo kana xiqqoo adda ture.
They are people.	Namoota dha.
Playing with it.	Itti taphachuu.
Now, three questions.	Amma, gaaffii sadii.
He still didn’t want her to know.	Ammallee akka isheen beektu hin barbaanne.
It’s important.	Barbaachisaa dha.
I'm not sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti.
He looked up from his book.	Kitaaba isaa keessaa ol jedhee ilaale.
Can you get this for him.	Kana isaaf argachuu dandeessaa.
I could do something really special with this.	Kanaan waan dhuguma adda ta'e hojjechuu nan danda'a ture.
It wasn't early.	Dafee hin turre.
It wasn’t right but it was enough.	Sirrii hin turre garuu gahaa ture.
He thought it was easy.	Salphaa itti fakkaate.
But it has the most important one.	Garuu isa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta’e qaba.
I know he did.	Akka godhe nan beeka.
In this case.	Haala kana keessatti.
I was for him.	Ani isaaf ture.
But he is no longer there.	Garuu kana booda hin jiru.
As it was, he wasn’t.	Akkuma ture, inni hin turre.
There really is.	Dhuguma jira.
I still hope someone does, but I hope someone isn’t me.	Ammallee namni tokko akka godhu abdiin qaba, garuu namni tokko ana akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
One was enough.	Tokko gahaa ture.
Then, the time began.	Sana booda, yeroon jalqabe.
Too much to see and not enough time.	Waan baay'ee arguu fi yeroo gahaa hin turre.
It's not here.	Asitti hin jiru.
Maybe he didn’t have it.	Tarii hin qabu ture.
It was already there.	Duraan ture.
In everyone, in everything.	Nama hunda keessatti, waan hundumaa keessatti.
But they are wrong.	Garuu dogoggora qabu.
I love this episode.	Kutaa kana baay'een jaalladha.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
There can be no more than one.	Tokko ol ta'uu hin danda'u.
You are not enough.	Ati gahaa miti.
I wasn't so sure.	Ani akkasitti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
It was my father.	Abbaa koo ture.
I'm here for you, girl.	Siif as jira intala.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoon hin qabu ture.
I was a very late starter.	Ani nama baayyee booda jalqabe ture.
You can do it now.	Amma gochuu dandeessa.
A bad idea.	Yaada hamaa.
Without feeling.	Miira hin qabne.
That’s when we went.	Yeroo sanatti deemne.
He told her not to do that.	Akkas akka hin goone itti hime.
Just like my mother.	Akkuma haadha kooti.
I didn't think much of it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
What more could you ask for?.	Kana caalaa maal gaafachuu dandeessa?.
You didn’t do that.	Ati akkas hin goone.
I'm not exactly sure why, but it does.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti hin beeku, garuu ni qaba.
Around him, around him.	Naannoo isaa, naannoo isaa.
This stuff works both ways.	Wanti kun karaa lamaan hojjeta.
He was different then.	Inni yeroo sana adda ture.
Meeting new people.	Namoota haaraa waliin wal arguu.
We were right, there.	Sirrii turre, achitti.
But there was no sound.	Garuu sagalee tokkollee hin turre.
Not him, not now.	Isa miti amma miti.
They come to help.	Gargaaruuf dhufu.
The sooner I know the better.	Akkuma dafee beeku caalaa gaarii dha.
I almost want to apologize.	Dhiifama gaafachuu barbaada jechuun ni danda'ama.
I know that feeling.	Miira sana nan beeka.
It was about us.	Waa'ee keenya ture.
Both of these are good things from time to time.	Kun lamaan yeroo yeroon waan gaarii ta’u.
I don't understand what exactly happens.	Sirriitti maaltu akka ta'u naaf hin galle.
This wasn’t the case.	Kun hin turre.
I didn’t want to give that up.	Sana dhiisuu hin barbaanne.
I think there will be.	Ni jiraata jedheen yaada.
I didn't really know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e dhuguma hin beeku ture.
There is no time today.	Har'a yeroon hin jiru.
I looked up at him.	Ol jedheen ilaale.
They want to be here.	As ta'uu barbaadu.
That she didn’t want them.	Akka isheen isaan hin barbaanne.
I don’t make this a big deal.	Kana dhimma guddaa hin godhu.
He was such a good father.	Abbaa gaarii akkasii ture.
But this was not the case.	Kun garuu akkas hin turre.
It was all becoming clear to me.	Hundi naaf ifa ta'aa ture.
I might be able to do this.	Kana gochuu nan danda'a ta'a.
That would be really bad.	Sun dhuguma hamaa ta'a.
But I don't agree with you.	Garuu si waliin walii hin galle.
One year.	Waggaa tokko.
They were just doing their job.	Hojii isaanii qofa hojjechaa turan.
Asking for help.	Gargaarsa gaafachuu.
I didn’t see anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin argine.
That was yours.	Sun kan kee ture.
Great great.	Guddaa guddaa.
I need to do that.	Sana gochuun na barbaachisa.
That’s all I wanted to tell you.	Kana qofa sitti himuu barbaade.
They rarely go at night.	Halkan yeroo muraasaaf ni deemu.
You two are.	Isin lamaan.
But it was nothing.	Garuu homaa hin turre.
Therefore, this may not be the exact reason for this.	Kanaaf, kun sababa sirrii kanaaf ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
Except for your children, that is.	Ijoollee keessan malee, jechuun.
I don't have any.	Ani tokkollee hin qabu.
And it’s still the same.	Ammas kanuma.
He only has one hand.	Harka tokko qofa qaba.
It was before anything else.	Waan biraa dura ture.
In one together.	Tokko keessatti waliin.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
She was doing the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechaa turte.
Not in her day and time.	Guyyaa fi yeroo ishee keessatti miti.
For sure you will love it.	Mirkanaa'aa ta'ee akka jaallattu.
He just had something different about him.	Inni waa'ee isaa waan adda ta'e qofa qaba ture.
Who knows when.	Yeroo eenyutu beeka.
I’d rather have them here.	Asitti isaan qabaachuu naaf wayya.
It was before my time.	Yeroon isaa yeroo koo dura ture.
That can't be the case.	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u.
He had many friends and many interests.	Hiriyyoota baayʼee fi fedhii baayʼee qaba ture.
I don’t have kids, but I want to have them.	Ijoollee hin qabu, garuu qabaachuu barbaada.
How do you	Akkamitti .
I can't live without them.	Isaan malee jiraachuu hin danda'u.
It's doing well.	Gaarii hojjechaa jira.
It could happen tonight.	Halkan kana ta'uu danda'a.
He wanted to cry.	Iyyuu barbaade.
Maybe something completely different.	Tarii waan guutummaatti adda ta'e ta'uu danda'a.
This will be necessary later.	Kun booda barbaachisaa ta’a.
I love going back.	Duubatti deebi'uu nan jaalladha.
You're there.	Ati achi jirta.
He got food.	Nyaata argate.
One stayed with us for a while.	Tokko yeroo muraasaaf nu bira ture.
It shouldn't be a big deal.	Waan guddaa ta'uu hin qabu.
They love their lives.	Jireenya isaanii ni jaallatu.
It'll be easy.	Salphaa ta'a.
But he quickly got over that.	Garuu sana dafee irra darbe.
He’s not really your father.	Inni dhuguma abbaa kee miti.
It’s in my book.	Kitaaba koo keessa jira.
They can be like that.	Isaan akkas ta’uu danda’u.
She is not real.	Isheen dhugaa miti.
It’s always different.	Yeroo hundumaa adda.
There was no one here.	Asitti namni tokkollee hin turre.
It still exists.	Ammallee jira.
It was still right.	Ammallee sirrii ture.
We never have her again.	Kana booda gonkumaa ishee hin qabnu.
Just like the person he was right now.	Akkuma nama yeroo ammaa ture sanaa.
This was all wrong, of course.	Kun hundi dogoggora akka ture beekamaadha.
It wasn’t there yet.	Ammallee hin turre.
It’s a good thing.	Waan gaarii dha.
But it might not be a good idea.	Garuu tarii yaada gaarii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I'm not sure what it means in the bigger picture.	Suuraa guddaa irratti maal jechuu akka ta'e hin beeku.
He probably should have.	Inni tarii qabaachuu qaba.
She was there then.	Yeroo sana achi turte.
It's just not bad.	Hamaa miti qofa.
But nothing is ever about just one thing.	Garuu wanti gonkumaa waa'ee waan tokko qofa ta'e hin jiru.
But then as he had.	Garuu sana booda akkuma inni qabu ture.
She wouldn't have thought.	Silaa hin yaaddu turte.
People have, you know.	Namoonni qabu, beekta.
There is no time.	Yeroon hin jiru.
But she said no more.	Isheen garuu kana caalaa hin dubbanne.
I can't say anything about it.	Waa'ee isaa homaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
But they may not give you exactly what you want.	Garuu waan ati barbaaddu sirriitti siif kennuu dhiisuu danda’u.
It seems right.	Sirriitti fakkaata.
I wanted to say a few things about this.	Kana irratti waan muraasa dubbachuu barbaade.
I am sure you know this.	Kana akka beektu mirkanaa'adha.
We wanted answers.	Deebii barbaanne.
It can be a problem.	Rakkoo ta'uu danda'a.
Maybe that's when today.	Tarii har'a yeroo sana ta'uu danda'a.
This is wrong, and therefore wrong.	Kun dogoggora, kanaaf dogoggora.
Meet your needs.	Fedhii keessan guutuu.
It was a drink, of course.	Dhugaatii dhugaa ture, beekamaadha.
That's it.	Kanuma.
He said he didn't understand.	Hin hubanne jedhe.
They are definitely not the same.	Isaan tokko akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He has her.	Inni ishee qaba.
No one is sure what to make of it.	Namni maal akka itti godhu mirkanaa'aa hin jiru.
He knew what was what.	Maal maal akka ta'e beeka ture.
What else could he do.	Kan biraa maal gochuu danda'a ture.
I never did it.	Ani gonkumaa hin goone.
We can’t have it both ways.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
I couldn't see much of them.	Waan baay'ee isaan arguu hin dandeenye.
Again, a good idea.	Ammas yaada gaarii.
We had to live in that.	Sana keessa jiraachuu qabna turre.
You have a full life to live.	Jireenya guutuu jiraachuu qabdu qabda.
When they have a voice.	Yeroo sagalee qabu.
There is a reason.	Sababni qaba.
What are we waiting for?.	Maal eegaa jirra?.
So, this happened.	Kanaaf, kun ta'e.
I have been there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi tureera.
She still can’t walk.	Ammallee deemuu hin dandeessu.
Sometimes it was better to be lucky.	Yeroo tokko tokko carraa qabaachuu wayya ture.
But no one seemed to enjoy it.	Garuu namni itti gammade hin fakkaatu ture.
It was just a feeling.	Miira qofa ture.
Currently, the reason is unclear.	Yeroo ammaa kana sababni isaa ifa miti.
That didn’t quite work.	Sun guutummaatti hin hojjenne.
He just wanted the area.	Inni naannoo sana qofa barbaade.
But not in this.	Garuu kana keessatti miti.
You don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beektu.
No question there.	Achitti gaaffii hin qabu.
It’s all us.	Hundi isaa nuti.
Wait at our door.	Balbala keenya eegaa.
You have a lot going for you.	Ati waan baay'ee siif deemu qabda.
By his wife.	Haadha manaa isaatiin.
That was something people needed to know.	Sun waan namoonni beekuu qaban ture.
You’ve known her for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee beekta.
But he said he could see it.	Garuu arguu danda'a jedhe.
We still have one, but now it’s different.	Ammallee tokko qabna, amma garuu adda.
He's going somewhere else.	Bakka biraa deemaa jira.
You can do what you love.	Waan jaallattu hojjechuu dandeessa.
It seems that only one person looks like this.	Namni tokko qofa akka fakkaatu kana fakkaata.
This night was not about us being bad.	Halkan kun waa'ee nuti hamaa ta'uu keenya hin turre.
I wanted to ask a question.	Gaaffii tokko gaafachuu barbaade.
That’s nothing new.	Sun waan haaraa miti.
He didn't even talk to me about these things.	Waa'ee wantoota kanaa ana waliin illee hin dubbanne.
No one told him anything.	Namni homaa itti hime hin jiru.
We didn’t become.	Nuti hin taane.
Boy, that did it.	Gurbaa, sun godhe.
You can usually find what you are looking for inside.	Yeroo baayyee waan barbaaddu keessa argachuu dandeessa.
I'm usually not like that.	Ani yeroo baayyee akkas miti.
Many of you are right.	Baay'een keessan sirrii dha.
In his house.	Mana isaa keessatti.
Not your favorite though.	Kan ati jaallattu miti garuu.
It works well.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta.
That’s how I came here.	Akkasitti as dhufe.
This isn't about you, it's about me.	Kun waa'ee kee osoo hin taane waa'ee kooti.
But nothing matters.	Garuu wanti dhimma hin qabu.
I knew we would.	Akka goonu nan beeka ture.
If this, then.	Yoo kun, sana booda.
He knew the name.	Maqaa sana ni beeka ture.
It was in his home area.	Naannoo mana isaa keessa ture.
I hope this one probably helps.	Inni kun tarii akka gargaaru abdiin qaba.
You only have one job.	Hojii tokko qofa qabda.
I wish things were different.	Osoo wanti adda ta'ee natti tola.
I still have it.	Ammas qaba.
Except maybe herself.	Tarii ofii ishee malee.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
No one saw him.	Namni isa arge hin jiru.
This couldn’t be true.	Kun dhugaa ta’uu hin dandeenye.
In a way that.	Haala akka...
Not all of them worked.	Hundi hin hojjenne.
You can buy it today.	Har'a bitachuu dandeessu.
It should be quick.	Dafee ta'uu qaba.
He's never been mean to me.	Inni natti hamaa ta'ee hin beeku.
Can you please help me in finding it.	Mee argachuu irratti na gargaaruu dandeessu.
You can never know this.	Kana gonkumaa beekuu hin dandeessu.
He was looking for you.	Inni si barbaadaa ture.
It seemed like she did.	Akkas waan goote fakkaata ture.
This is not asking for much.	Kun waan guddaa gaafachuu miti.
I think we did that.	Akkas goone natti fakkaata.
She’s just alone.	Isheen kophaa ishee qofa.
The problem was they wanted to see me.	Rakkoon ture na arguu barbaadu turan.
Just check for accuracy.	Sirrii ta'uu isaa qofa ilaalaa.
The tall guy.	Gurbaa dheeraa.
Maybe it's better that way.	Tarii akkas wayya ta'a.
Wrong!.	Dogoggora!.
We went well with them.	Akka gaariitti isaan waliin deemne.
It's okay.	Homaa miti.
Everything else is the same.	Wanti biraa hundi tokko.
It could have been just one of those things.	Silaa wantoota sana keessaa tokko qofa ta’uu danda’a ture.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
I know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru nan beeka.
I know now that none of this is true.	Kana keessaa tokkollee dhugaa akka hin taane amma beeka.
I don’t have it.	Hin qabu.
What makes a joke.	Qoosaa maaltu godha.
He was at work.	Hojii irra ture.
I still couldn’t believe it.	Ammallee amanuu hin dandeenye.
From her house.	Mana ishee irraa.
That won't happen anymore.	Kana booda sun hin ta'u.
You know the area.	Naannoo sana ni beektu.
There should be some book about it.	Waa'ee isaa kitaaba tokko tokko jiraachuu qaba.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Garuu isa qofa hin turre.
These do work though.	Isaan kun ni hojjetu garuu.
I didn't tell him anything.	Ani homaa itti hin himne.
She was wrong, of course.	Isheen dogoggora akka turte beekamaadha.
To do something.	Waan hojjechuuf.
What was he.	Maal inni ture.
We don’t have much luck up there.	Carraa guddaa achi ol hin qabnu.
Someone in the room did.	Namni kutaa sana keessa jiru tokko akkas godhe.
Obviously, something was wrong.	Wanti tokko dogoggora akka ture ifaadha.
Here, everyone had a place.	Asitti, namni hundi bakka qaba ture.
The only one.	Kan qofa.
This will not be an easy task.	Kun hojii salphaa hin ta’u.
This certainly hasn’t happened in real life yet.	Kun jireenya dhugaa keessatti hanga ammaatti akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I’m not telling you any of that.	Ani waan akkasii tokkollee sitti hin himu.
Which she has.	Kan isheen qabdu.
He had to say something.	Waan tokko dubbachuu qaba ture.
No one will tell me.	Namni natti himu hin jiru.
I didn't know about the new girl.	Waa'ee intala haaraa hin beeku ture.
He was waiting for someone.	Nama eegaa ture.
It contains life.	Jireenya of keessaa qaba.
I haven’t done it before.	Kanaan dura hin hojjenne.
Everything’s simple and streamlined.	Wanti hundi salphaa fi sirrii ta’e.
I did that a lot back in the day.	Bara sanatti baay'een akkas godha ture.
It wasn’t like that before.	Duraan akkas hin turre.
Maybe it's something else entirely.	Tarii guutummaatti waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
It will be my greatest moment!.	Yeroo koo isa guddaa ta'a!.
Home again, now.	Ammas gara manaatti, amma.
He wanted to live on his terms.	Haala isaatiin jiraachuu barbaade.
This is my father.	Kun abbaa kooti.
In the lab, alone, after hours.	Mana yaalaa keessatti, kophaa isaa, sa'aatii booda.
He’s our guy.	Inni gurbaa keenya.
We are in a different place.	Bakka adda ta'e keessa jirra.
If he wants to.	Yoo barbaade.
That's more of it.	Caalaatti kanuma.
He knew that voice.	Sagalee sana ni beeka ture.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
You can’t help but do this.	Kana gochuu dhiisuu hin dandeessu.
Some of these people need to find the truth.	Namoota kana keessaa tokko tokko dhugaa argachuu qabu.
You’re the only one.	Ati qofa jirta.
She must have a reason.	Sababa qabdi ta'uu qaba.
But it could have gone the other way.	Garuu karaa biraa deemuu danda'a ture.
Not that he doesn’t understand.	Akka hin hubanne miti.
I knew that feeling.	Miira sana nan beeka ture.
He lives a good life.	Jireenya gaarii jiraata.
But you just couldn’t do it.	Garuu ati gochuu hin dandeenye qofa.
It had been an accident.	Balaa ta'ee ture.
You can give it to me.	Naaf kennuu dandeessa.
He found his way.	Karaa isaa argate.
Except for school and back.	Mana barumsaa fi deebi'uu malee.
They think only of themselves.	Ofii qofa yaadu.
He thought through what had happened.	Waan ta'e keessaa yaade.
It is happening and it may be soon.	Ta'aa jiraachuu fi yeroo dhiyootti ta'uu danda'a.
Now there is something.	Amma wanti tokko jira.
But I didn’t know that.	Garuu sana hin beeku ture.
Not someone who is doing us a favor.	Nama tokko tola nuuf gochaa jiru miti.
She has a lot of them.	Baay'ee isaanii qabdi.
Not sure if something is serious.	Wanti tokko hamaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
You love your children.	Ijoollee keessan ni jaallattu.
I wasn’t trying to do that.	Ani akkas gochuuf yaalaa hin turre.
I’m not exactly into that mindset.	Ani sirriitti yaada sana keessa hin galle.
It’s all just this year.	Hundi isaa bara kana qofa.
You have to be a dog, really, that's what it is.	Saree ta'uu qabda, dhuguma, wanti jiru kanuma.
We need to find her.	Ishee argachuu qabna.
This has to be here, that has to be.	Kun asitti ta'uu qaba, sun ta'uu qaba.
I have to say a few times.	Yeroo muraasa jechuun qaba.
She just didn’t understand.	Isheen garuu hin hubanne qofa.
But they had money.	Garuu qarshii qabu turan.
This is very important.	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
They have no children at home.	Mana keessatti ijoollee hin qaban.
Man.	Nama.
I'm not saying that's what happened.	Akkas ta'e jechuu koo miti.
But enough was enough.	Garuu gahaa ture gahaa ture.
It may even be a valid reason.	Sababni sirrii illee ta’uu danda’a.
Now you know why.	Amma maaliif akka ta'e beekta.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
It could very well be.	Baay’ee gaarii ta’uu danda’a.
From there, it’s.	Achi irraa.
She was always in me.	Yeroo hundumaa na keessa turte.
It looks good.	Gaarii fakkaata.
Things no one else does.	Wantoota namni biraa hin hojjenne.
Now there were no eyes outside of them.	Amma isaan ala ija hin turre.
Maybe it's two things.	Tarii waan lama ta'a.
A very good book.	Kitaaba baayyee gaarii.
But there were a lot of people in the room.	Garuu kutaa sana keessa namoonni baay'ee turan.
But it hadn’t worked before.	Garuu kanaan dura hin hojjenne ture.
You will love this one.	Isa kana ni jaallattu.
That’s how it’s always been.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ture.
Then he goes away.	Sana booda ni deema.
I think he likes her.	Ishee waan jaallatu natti fakkaata.
I have nowhere else to go.	Bakka biraa itti deemu hin qabu.
I don't want to ask him anything.	Homaa isa gaafachuu hin barbaadu.
You know this is dangerous.	Kun balaa akka qabu ni beektu.
Think you might be interested?.	Fedhii qabaachuu dandeessa jettanii yaaddu?.
It works extremely well.	Garmalee gaarii hojjeta.
It was me today.	Har'a ana ture.
We have to be honest.	Dhugaa dubbachuu qabna.
You have to come along.	Waliin dhufuu qabda.
She had a job to do.	Hojii hojjechuu qabdu qabdi turte.
I couldn't speak here.	Asitti dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I couldn't find it now.	Amma argachuu hin dandeenye.
Of course, he only has to work with the same people.	Namoota tokko qofa waliin hojjechuu akka qabu beekamaadha.
That you are.	Akka ati jirtu.
I couldn't have said that.	Silaa akkas jechuu hin danda'u ture.
So we're going to be good.	Kanaaf gaarii ta'uuf jirra.
I know you’re doing it.	Akka hojjechaa jirtu nan beeka.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
But I can't stay here long.	Garuu yeroo dheeraa as turuu hin danda'u.
I don’t know how that one got past us.	Inni sun akkamitti akka nu bira darbe hin beeku.
I thought that was even possible.	Sun illee ni dandaʼa jedheen yaade.
But we didn’t know what to do.	Garuu maal akka goonu hin beekne.
That is not the case right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana akkas miti.
Two weeks later, no one did.	Torban lama booda namni hin goone.
I mean, there's only one.	Tokko qofa jechuu kooti.
If you did, you would be able to speak.	Osoo akkas goote dubbachuu ni dandeessa turte.
You don’t have to give one away.	Tokko kennuu hin qabdu.
Clearly, that is no longer the case.	Kana booda akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
Not really on her.	Dhuguma ishee irra miti.
That doesn't mean you don't.	Kana jechuun hin gootu.
Please join us!.	Mee nu waliin ta'aa!.
Right about here.	Sirriitti waa'ee asitti.
They must be.	Ta'uu qabu.
That he was.	Inni akka ture.
He used to say that.	Duraan akkas jedha ture.
He couldn't be a local.	Nama naannoo ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
There is nothing else.	Wanti biraa hin jiru.
But it came this way.	Garuu karaa kanaan dhufe.
He'll be fine.	Inni gaarii ta'a.
. . . .	.
It can go with a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee waliin deemuu danda'a.
I couldn’t see anyone.	Nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
Just as simple as that.	Akkuma salphaa sana.
But if it doesn’t.	Garuu yoo hin taane.
If he goes, good for him.	Yoo deeme gaarii isaaf.
It doesn’t mean.	Jechuu miti.
He was staring at them.	Ija keessa isaan ilaalaa ture.
I could have stayed indoors.	Silaa mana keessa turuu nan danda'a ture.
Still in school.	Ammallee mana barumsaa keessa.
You may be able to do the voice well.	Sagalee sana akka gaariitti hojjechuu dandeessa taʼa.
Nobody.	Namni tokkollee.
We are just human beings.	Nuti nama qofa.
You can’t get any better than that.	Kana caalaa argachuu hin dandeessu.
Maybe it didn't happen.	Tarii hin taane ta'a.
But it's nothing.	Garuu homaa miti.
But this need not be the case.	Garuu kun ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
But that’s not the only problem.	Garuu rakkoon jiru kana qofa miti.
He was dutifully right.	Dirqama qabu sirrii ture.
That's what's right for you.	Kan siif ta'u kanuma.
Me, you might say.	Ana, jechuu dandeessu.
It doesn’t mean it worked.	Hojjete jechuu miti.
He can't get enough.	Inni gahaa argachuu hin danda'u.
This is what.	Kun waan.
He saw his father in the car.	Abbaa isaa konkolaataa keessa arge.
Both of these will work.	Kun lamaan ni hojjetu.
That may be the case.	Akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
They will be on their way soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti karaa irra jiru.
We have it there.	Achitti qabna.
I was looking at her.	Ani ishee ilaalaa ture.
This is not my father.	Kun abbaa koo miti.
Yet.	Ammallee.
It stayed in place for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf bakka isaa ture.
This is not really true.	Kun dhuguma dhugaa miti.
But only if it works.	Garuu yoo hojjete qofa.
I didn't think about that.	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadne.
I can tell you how one goes.	Akkamitti tokko akka deemu sitti himuu nan danda'a.
I love this job so much.	Hojii kana baay'een jaalladha.
But he didn't need it much of the time.	Garuu yeroo baay'ee isa hin barbaachifne.
It seems so good.	Akkasitti waan gaarii fakkaata.
People knew about it, but they didn't say anything.	Namoonni waa'ee kanaa beeku, garuu homaa hin dubbanne.
I don't know why this is.	Kun maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku.
Then look at it.	Sana booda ilaalaa.
He got it quickly.	Dafee argate.
That’s how it should play out.	Akkasitti taphachuu qaba.
Very much, perhaps.	Baay'ee, tarii.
He is waiting for us.	Nu eegaa jira.
It is not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa miti.
Now it was different.	Amma adda ture.
Anything else would be better.	Wanti biraa kana caalaa gaarii ta'a.
People go a little further.	Namoonni xiqqoo caalaa deemu.
You could say it was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture jechuu dandeessa.
I’m just human, you know.	Ani nama qofa, beekta.
As he said.	Akkuma jedhe.
It could have been all good.	Hundi isaa gaarii ta’uu danda’a ture.
It was too big.	Garmalee guddaa ture.
Now this is it.	Amma isa kana.
This is not my job.	Kun hojii koo miti.
She had no idea what it was like.	Maal akka fakkaatu yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
I think there’s more to it than that.	Kana caalaa waan jiru jedheen yaada.
Good sound and play all around.	Sagalee gaarii fi naannoo hunda taphachuu.
It's a joke and not.	Qoosaa fi miti.
I looked right through it.	Anis sirriitti keessa ilaale.
He didn’t care, of course.	Inni dhimma hin qabu ture, beekamaadha.
Everyone should help.	Namni hundi gargaaruu qaba.
Maybe it's good.	Tarii gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
This cannot be true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
That didn’t happen here.	Asitti akkas hin taane.
I have to know she's right.	Isheen sirrii ta'uu ishee beekuu qaba.
We need Him.	Isa nu barbaachisa.
But you have to be willing to be wrong.	Garuu dogoggora ta'uuf fedhii qabaachuu qabda.
Every little mistake.	Dogoggora xiqqoo hunda.
Disaster, perhaps.	Balaa, tarii.
There is no time to do that.	Yeroon akkas gochuuf hin jiru.
She wasn’t there.	Isheen achi hin turre.
This is what happens.	Kun ni ta'a.
But it was good.	Garuu gaarii ture.
I'm the one.	Ani isa.
I can't say just when.	Yoom qofa jechuu hin danda'u.
I really have no idea what is going on.	Dhuguma waan ta'aa jiru yaada hin qabu.
She should have stayed home.	Silaa mana keessa turuu qabdi turte.
You can leave her here, she'll be fine.	Asitti ishee dhiisuu dandeessa, isheen gaarii ta'a.
I know it’s nothing, but still.	Homaa akka hin taane nan beeka, garuu ammas.
A good husband.	Abbaa manaa gaarii.
These people are like us.	Namoonni kun nu fakkaatu.
It’s not my business.	Dhimma koo miti.
Today would be different.	Har'a silaa adda ta'a.
None of those people spoke.	Namoota sana keessaa tokkollee hin dubbanne.
Not another time.	Yeroo biraa miti.
This is not how it should be.	Kun akka ta'uu qabu miti.
I want you to do this for me.	Kana akka naaf gootu nan barbaada.
You can see it.	Arguu dandeessu.
Now is not our time.	Amma yeroon keenya miti.
We have a lot of stuff like that.	Waan akkasii baay'ee qabna.
She did it.	Ni goote.
She made me say it several times.	Yeroo hedduu akkan jedhu na goote.
We still have some work to do here.	Ammas asitti hojii tokko tokko qabna.
But someone has to say this stuff.	Garuu namni tokko waan kana dubbachuu qaba.
Maybe they were right, maybe they weren't.	Tarii sirrii turan ta'a, tarii sirrii hin turre ta'a.
A lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee.
So it’s not going well for me.	Kanaaf naaf gaarii hin deemu.
I said it wasn't.	Anis akkas miti jedheen.
I don't want to stay.	Ani turuu hin barbaadu.
He said you might be right.	Sirrii ta'uu dandeessa jedhe.
He looked at it again.	Ammas ilaale.
I don't know his condition.	Haala isaa hin beeku.
It doesn't even need to be a thing.	Waan ta'uu illee hin barbaachisu.
Any thoughts about that.	Waa'ee sanaa yaada qabduu.
Cause.	Sababa.
I knew it wasn’t what she wanted.	Waan isheen barbaaddu akka hin taane nan beeka ture.
Date...	Guyyaa...
That wasn’t true.	Sun dhugaa hin turre.
When most people don't have it.	Yeroo namoonni baay'een hin qaban.
He had a wife.	Haadha manaa qaba ture.
But it's better than nothing.	Garuu homaa ta'uu irra wayya.
I just didn’t see that much interest there.	Fedhii hamma sanaa achitti hin argine qofa.
That is important to do.	Sun gochuun barbaachisaa dha.
But maybe it could happen.	Garuu tarii ta'uu danda'a.
We need to meet.	Wal arguu qabna.
He found trouble.	Rakkoo argate.
But it never worked.	Garuu gonkumaa hin hojjenne.
I knew her.	Ani ishee beeka ture.
Then again, who knows.	Sana booda ammas eenyutu beeka.
He shouldn't have come.	Silaa dhufuu hin qabu ture.
I don’t know the answer yet.	Deebii isaa hanga ammaatti beekuu hin dandeenye.
I’m glad I went.	Deemuu kootti gammadeera.
Nothing else was wrong.	Wanti biraa dogoggora hin turre.
This was what she did.	Kun waan isheen goote ture.
Otherwise it looked pretty good.	Yoo kana hin taane baayyee gaarii fakkaata ture.
You know me, you know me.	Ati na beekta.
The exception was me.	Kan kanaan ala ture ana ture.
I might be able to help.	Gargaaruu nan dandaʼa taʼa.
That she wants to have a party.	Affeerraa qabaachuu akka barbaaddu.
She needs to tell me what to do.	Waan godhu natti himuu qabdi.
Things like that.	Wantoota akkasii.
I’m glad I did my job.	Hojii koo hojjechuu kootti gammadeera.
He wasn't sure he wanted to.	Inni akka barbaadu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
This is the most important thing.	Kun waan hundumaa caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
That doesn’t work.	Sun hin hojjetu.
But it hasn’t been there yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti hin turre.
You think you want to see it.	Arguu barbaaddu sitti fakkaata.
It’s not something like that.	Waan akkasii miti.
I don’t have the answer.	Deebii isaa hin qabu.
But you are right.	Garuu ati sirrii dha.
Now this could be wrong.	Amma kun dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
It wasn’t going to last long.	Yeroo dheeraa turuuf hin turre.
Man does it, but it doesn't seem to be us.	Namni ni hojjeta malee nu ta'a hin fakkaatu.
That and that alone.	Sana fi sana qofa.
Room and board.	Kutaa fi nyaata.
This isn't just about you.	Kun waa'ee kee qofa miti.
But my father and mother, she said.	Abbaa koo fi haadha koo garuu jette.
I need a place for you.	Bakka siif barbaada.
I hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
He couldn't live.	Jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
It was them.	Isaan ture.
That he was still waiting for me.	Ammallee na eegaa akka ture.
A year has passed.	Waggaa tokko darbe.
We are not interested in doing that.	Nuti akkas gochuuf fedhii hin qabnu.
He wouldn't say what happened.	Waan ta'e hin jedhu ture.
I haven’t seen you in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf si hin argine.
He looked at it for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf ilaale.
They say he has no food.	Nyaata hin qabu jedhu.
This is going to be good.	Kun gaarii ta'uuf deema.
So many things could have gone wrong.	Kanaaf wanti baay'een dogoggora ta'uu danda'a ture.
About.	Waa'ee.
You don’t even think he’s good.	Inni gaarii illee sitti hin fakkaatu.
What else could I ask for.	Kan biraa maal gaafachuu danda'a ture.
It's so good.	Akkas gaarii dha.
I knew he was in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa akka jiru nan beeka ture.
I don't quite understand what you mean.	Maal jechuu kee sirriitti naaf hin galle.
I don't know, sorry.	Ani hin beeku dhiifama.
John was old school.	Yohaannis mana barumsaa durii ture.
He has three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba.
But then he wondered if it really was.	Sana booda garuu dhuguma akkas taʼuu isaa yaade.
He couldn't be watching where he was going.	Bakka deemu ilaalaa jiraachuu hin danda'u ture.
This is not on it.	Kun irra hin jiru.
It was a long time, of course.	Yeroo dheeraa akka ture beekamaadha.
We need to help.	Gargaaruu qabna.
Everything is going well.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deemaa jira.
He said that.	Akkas jedhe.
I can't say why right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana maaliif akka ta'e jechuu hin danda'u.
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
I knew he was right.	Sirrii akka taʼe nan beeka ture.
He obviously doesn’t want to see us.	Nu arguu akka hin barbaanne ifaadha.
I didn't think much of it.	Baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
Chances are you do.	Carraan akka ati gootu jira.
We have our own names.	Maqaa keenya qabna.
Not so much.	Hamma kana miti.
I don’t know where I’m going.	Eessa akkan deemu hin beeku.
But she had not gone.	Isheen garuu hin deemne turte.
It could never be anywhere else.	Bakka biraa ta'uu gonkumaa hin danda'u ture.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Kun akka hin taane ifaadha.
I had nothing to say to her.	Waan isheen jedhu hin qabu ture.
It still didn’t work.	Ammas hin hojjenne.
We can’t have it now.	Amma qabaachuu hin dandeenyu.
I know how a lot of things work.	Wanti baay'een akkamitti akka hojjetu nan beeka.
A long dog.	Saree dheeraa.
But now everyone saw it.	Amma garuu namni hundi arge.
That’s not lucky.	Sun carraa miti.
She is still two years old.	Ammallee umuriin ishee lama.
A lot of people do that.	Namoonni baay'een akkas godhu.
They couldn’t speak.	Isaan dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
We never really had to do them.	Dhuguma gonkumaa isaan gochuu hin qabnu ture.
Everything has to be perfect.	Wanti hundi guutuu ta'uu qaba.
You don’t have to do anything else.	Waan biraa gochuun dirqama miti.
All that time.	Yeroo sana hunda.
To be, you know.	Akka ta'uuf, beekta.
You have the right wife at home.	Mana keessatti haadha manaa sirrii qabda.
It’s not a job.	Hojii miti.
This is the problem.	Rakkoon jiru kana.
But he didn't go.	Garuu hin deemne.
It was good for him.	Isaaf gaarii ture.
I don’t know why I do that.	Maaliif akkas godhu hin beeku.
I'm looking for it.	Ani nan barbaada.
Good luck next year.	Carraa gaarii bara dhufu.
Three is obvious.	Sadii ifaadha.
Without her you are nothing.	Ishee malee ati homaa miti.
This was nothing.	Kun homaa hin turre.
That was all it was.	Kana qofa ture.
It was in excellent condition.	Haala gaarii irra ture.
He was so lucky.	Akkasitti carraa qaba ture.
It was really exactly right.	Dhuguma sirriitti sirrii ture.
We were looking for you.	Si barbaadaa turre.
About.	Waa'ee.
You know this.	Kana isin beektu.
They were all bad.	Hundi isaanii hamaa turan.
I love living here.	As jiraachuu nan jaalladha.
All to be something other than what you are.	Hundi waan ati taate malee waan biraa ta’uuf.
That's working fine.	Sun gaarii ta'ee hojjechaa jira.
Sometimes knowing the right answer.	Yeroo tokko tokko deebii sirrii beekuu.
You are not my husband.	Ati abbaa manaa koo miti.
But it was nothing.	Garuu homaa hin turre.
You just know.	Ati qofa beekta.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
It was a place like no other.	Bakka kan biraa hin taane ture.
I really don’t know what else to say.	Dhuguma kana caalaa maal akkan jedhu hin beeku.
I don't understand what happened.	Waan ta'e naaf hin galle.
They are not needed.	Isaan hin barbaachisu.
But it really doesn't.	Garuu dhuguma hin ta'u.
They know him well.	Isaan akka gaariitti isa beeku.
It certainly did for me.	Naaf akka godhe beekamaadha.
It can't matter.	Dhimma qabaachuu hin danda'u.
As it should be.	Akkuma ta'uu qabu.
It's just just.	Qofa qofa.
But now we have the full picture.	Amma garuu suuraa guutuu qabna.
That doesn't mean that.	Akkas jechuu miti.
You can have it tomorrow.	Boru qabaachuu dandeessa.
She has many of them.	Isaan keessaa hedduu qabdi.
This wasn't going to be easy.	Kun salphaa ta'uuf hin turre.
There's no reason it couldn't have happened.	Sababni hin jiru silaa akkas ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
No one is around.	Namni naannoo sana jiru hin jiru.
He had the right feeling.	Miira sirrii qaba ture.
It’s just a mistake.	Dogoggora qofa.
Always, always, someone else was there.	Yeroo hundumaa, yeroo hundumaa, namni biraa achi ture.
Hers and his.	Kan ishee fi kan isaa.
It doesn’t work.	Hin hojjetu.
I wouldn't have been able to say anything.	Silaa homaa dubbachuu hin danda'u ture.
Maybe she did.	Tarii isheen akkas goote ta'a.
Someone gave it to me.	Namni tokko naaf kenne.
Not sure this is necessary.	Kun barbaachisaa ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
So stay with me.	Kanaaf na waliin ta'aa.
He didn't do anything for us.	Homaa nuuf hin goone.
She is dangerous.	Isheen balaa qabdi.
Today, perhaps not.	Har'a tarii akkas miti.
But not today.	Garuu har'a miti.
Things to have.	Wantoota qabaachuu qaban.
She had to go back.	Deebi'uu qabdi turte.
This is now possible.	Kun amma ni danda'ama.
Some of them would be easy.	Isaan keessaa tokko tokko salphaa taʼa ture.
This will work.	Kun ni hojjeta.
But you never knew.	Garuu ati gonkumaa hin beekne.
Which doesn't work very often.	Kan yeroo baayyee hin hojjenne.
But this is not necessarily the case.	Garuu kun dirqama miti.
I never really know the answers to these things.	Dhuguma deebii wantoota kanaa gonkumaa hin beeku.
I was the one who did it.	Kan hojjete ana ture.
Again, this could just be me.	Ammas kun ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
They knew each other too well.	Garmalee wal beeku turan.
But this was the moment.	Garuu yeroon kun ture.
One didn’t know where she was.	Tokko bakka isheen jiru hin beekne.
You have to work on them.	Isaan irratti hojjechuu qabda.
Nothing that big of a deal.	Homaa hangas guddaa ta'e hin jiru.
One book, though.	Kitaaba tokko garuu.
We all have our stuff.	Hundi keenya waan keenya qabna.
I love the simplicity.	Salphaa ta'uu isaa nan jaalladha.
But so far nothing has worked.	Garuu hanga ammaatti wanti hojjete hin jiru.
This is not right.	Kun sirrii miti.
I can still see him.	Ammallee isa arguu nan danda'a.
This can't be happening, but it is, it really is.	Kun ta'aa jiraachuu hin danda'u, garuu ni jira, dhuguma ni jira.
It’s all the same for him.	Hundi isaaf wal fakkaata.
You never know who you might find!.	Eenyu argachuu akka dandeessu gonkumaa hin beektu!.
That might work.	Sun hojjechuu danda'a.
I have it now.	Amma qaba.
He told me I had to do whatever he thought was necessary.	Waan barbaachisa jedhee yaade hunda gochuu akkan qabu natti hime.
We were just kids.	Ijoollee qofa turre.
He’s here every night.	Halkan hunda as jira.
For this guy.	Gurbaa kanaaf.
That it is nothing to such things.	Wantoota akkasii kanaaf homaa akka hin taane.
He tried, it didn’t work.	Yaale, hin hojjenne.
You are in the right place.	Bakka sirrii jirta.
Then it’s fine.	Sana booda gaarii dha.
I wasn’t interested in doing it.	Ani hojjechuuf fedhii hin qabu ture.
Nothing was right.	Wanti tokkollee sirriitti hin turre.
He didn’t have enough work.	Hojii gahaa hin qabu ture.
I didn’t understand how.	Akkamitti akka taate hin hubanne.
He’s onto something.	Inni waan tokko irra jira.
The one that doesn’t work.	Kan hin hojjenne.
It just needs to find something in me.	Waan tokko na keessaa argachuu qofa barbaachisa.
Who knows though.	Eenyutu beeka garuu.
Nobody would do that.	Namni tokkollee waan akkasii hin hojjetu ture.
I didn’t want to eat it.	Nyaachuu hin barbaanne.
I still have no help.	Ammallee gargaarsa hin qabu.
It's just who he is.	Eenyu akka ta'e qofa.
They will be drinking and stuff.	Dhugaatii fi waan akkasii ni ta'u.
I don't know about it.	Waa'ee isaa hin beeku.
I really don’t know what to do now.	Dhuguma amma maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
It has to be two ways.	Karaa lama ta'uu qaba.
Who knows, it could happen.	Eenyu beeka, ta'uu danda'a.
That's how it seems.	Akkasitti fakkaata.
It seems to be happening now.	Kan amma ta'u fakkaata.
It was working fine a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura akka gaariitti hojjechaa ture.
I think it’s just true.	Dhugaa qofa natti fakkaata.
It’s good for me.	Naaf gaarii dha.
Around her, there was nothing.	Naannoo ishee, homaa hin turre.
I wasn't sure they knew anymore.	Kana booda beekuu isaanii mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
He is a good father.	Abbaa gaarii dha.
He said you know about that.	Waa'ee sanaa ni beekta jedhe.
I like it a lot more now.	Amma baay'ee natti tola.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
What is happening is not right.	Wanti ta'aa jiru sirrii miti.
It wasn’t a job.	Hojii hin turre.
It will never happen.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u.
Nothing could be so simple.	Wanti akkas salphaa taʼuu dandaʼu hin jiru.
This wasn’t the case.	Kun hin turre.
We have to find him, for sure.	Isa argachuu qabna, mirkanaa'aa.
It's probably been going on for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf deemaa ture ta'uu hin oolu.
I suppose you can comment.	Yaada kennuu dandeessu jedheen yaada.
The only problem is he’s not here yet.	Rakkoon inni ammallee as hin jiru qofa.
I don't know him well.	Ani sirriitti isa hin beeku.
As it happened.	Akkuma waan ta'e.
She has to go.	Deemu qabdi.
And I know you well enough.	Anis akka gaariitti si beeka.
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
But it wasn’t quite working.	Garuu guutummaatti hojjechaa hin turre.
It wasn’t himself.	Ofii isaa hin turre.
No one ever gave me anything.	Namni homaa naaf kenne hin beeku.
Very much indeed.	Baayyee dhuguma.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
You can never be one of them.	Ati gonkumaa isaan keessaa tokko ta’uu hin dandeessu.
But usually two.	Garuu yeroo baayyee lama.
There were a lot of people.	Namoonni baay'ee turan.
It’s not something you have.	Waan ati qabdu miti.
Not when you leave.	Yeroo deemtu miti.
I want to know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e beekuu barbaada.
I know he's only human.	Nama qofa akka ta'e nan beeka.
I don’t have any dog ​​food in the house.	Mana keessatti nyaata saree tokkollee hin qabu.
Maybe we're both right.	Tarii lamaan keenyayyuu sirrii ta'uu danda'a.
Things that should never see the light of day.	Wantoota ifa guyyaa arguu hin qabne.
One must know oneself.	Namni tokko of beekuu qaba.
You will know that in a moment.	Yeroo muraasa booda sana ni beekta.
You can’t do this again.	Ammas kana gochuu hin dandeessu.
Up here, it doesn’t work.	As ol, hin hojjetu.
I am a good person.	Ani nama gaarii dha.
Look at something.	Waan tokko ilaalaa.
So you have two issues.	Kanaaf dhimma lama qabda.
Why why why why why.	Maaliif maaliif maaliif maaliif.
They are completely different.	Isaan guutummaatti adda.
People will know.	Namoonni ni beeku.
I want no part of you.	Ani kutaa kee tokkollee hin barbaadu.
I didn't like talking about that kind of stuff.	Waa'ee waan akkasii dubbachuu hin jaalladhu ture.
This was like a part of it.	Kun akka kutaa isaa ture.
It matters to me right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana naaf dhimma.
I couldn’t even be interested.	Fedhii illee qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
I haven't thought much about it yet.	Hanga ammaatti baay'ee itti hin yaadne.
Everything would be fine.	Silaa wanti hundi gaarii ta'a.
You’re just saying you don’t like him.	Isa hin jaallattu jechuu kee qofa.
All he wants is his job.	Wanti inni barbaadu hojii isaa qofa.
That won't be so bad then.	Sun yeroo sana akkas hamaa hin ta'u.
Maybe one day.	Tarii guyyaa tokko.
Good for him.	Gaarii isaaf.
I like it a lot more now.	Amma baay'ee natti tola.
He had no idea where he was going.	Eessa akka deemu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
It was going to be a clear day.	Guyyaa ifa ta'uuf ture.
I really think about it a lot.	Dhuguma baay'een yaada.
It was a terrible accident.	Balaa hamaa ture.
I know he loves it.	Akka jaallatu nan beeka.
He wants the truth.	Dhugaa barbaada.
He knew he had them.	Isaan akka qabu ni beeka ture.
It all seemed fine to me.	Hundi gaarii natti fakkaate.
Very special to us.	Baayyee adda nuuf.
I enjoyed it.	Itti gammadeera.
It all went well.	Hundi isaa akka gaariitti deeme.
Nobody wanted to make money.	Namni maallaqa argachuu barbaadu hin turre.
But they have.	Garuu qaban.
What? 	Maal?
he says.	jedha.
Again, it is not true.	Ammas dhugaa miti.
I’m not a bad guy.	Ani gurbaa hamaa miti.
Only not just now.	Qofa amma qofa miti.
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
He now has a wife.	Amma haadha manaa qaba.
Someone has to give him help.	Namni tokko gargaarsa isaaf kennuu qaba.
It’s better for us than anything else.	Hunda caalaa nuuf wayya.
Not after today.	Har'a booda miti.
He seems to do just fine without it.	Isa malee waan gaarii hojjetu fakkaata.
Maybe that's the problem.	Tarii rakkoon jiru kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
Like this guy.	Akka gurbaa kanaa.
But still nothing happened.	Ammas garuu wanti ta'e hin jiru.
Just one of those things.	Wantoota sana keessaa tokko qofa.
You can’t have it both ways!.	Karaa lamaan qabaachuu hin dandeessu!.
Such a place.	Bakka akkasii.
Except for this one.	Isa kana malee.
Can't find his way here.	Karaa isaa asitti argachuu hin danda'u.
Now, she couldn’t do that.	Amma, isheen akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
That would be long.	Sun dheeraa ta'a.
None of them had said anything.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee homaa hin dubbanne ture.
But not just yet.	Garuu amma qofa miti.
I want to do more.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu nan barbaada.
It’s no different anymore.	Kana booda adda miti.
It would have been.	Silaa ta'a ture.
But this was a small suggestion.	Garuu kun yaada xiqqoo ture.
One of them was my mother.	Isaan keessaa tokko haadha koo turte.
Then again, he said what I wanted.	Sana booda ammas, waanan barbaadu jedhe.
We are not just our job!.	Nuti hojii keenya qofa miti!.
I care what you’re going through.	Waan ati keessa jirtu naaf dhimma.
I was doing what you wanted to do.	Waan gochuu barbaaddu hojjechaa ture.
I knew she still loved me.	Ammallee akka na jaallattu nan beeka ture.
It's just like that.	Akkas qofa.
Not after what I just saw.	Waan amma arge booda miti.
It wasn't going to happen.	Akka ta'uuf hin deemne.
Again, that is.	Ammas jechuun.
I wasn't sure what it was, but it was true.	Maal akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa hin turre, garuu dhugaa ture.
So far we have no clear idea what to do.	Hanga ammaatti maal akka goonu yaada ifa ta'e hin qabnu.
But they were so wrong.	Garuu isaan baayʼee dogoggora turan.
No two things are really the same.	Dhuguma wanti lama tokko hin jiru.
All of them.	Hundi ana.
Hopefully someone will help.	Namni tokko akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
Both of these are in excellent condition.	Isaan kun lamaan isaanii haala gaarii irra jiru.
He had nothing to tell her.	Waan itti himu hin qabu ture.
Not exactly bad.	Sirriitti hamaa miti.
Every day.	Guyyaa hunda.
But that doesn’t seem to work.	Garuu sun waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
That's not too bad.	Sun baayyee hamaa miti.
But now it is different.	Amma garuu adda.
Nothing is outside your own sense of self.	Miira ofii kee keessaa wanti ala ta’e hin jiru.
That has to come with time.	Sun yeroo waliin dhufuu qaba.
But sometimes it doesn't.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko hin ta'u.
We have to go.	Deemu qabna.
I don't want to go.	Ani deemuu hin barbaadu.
That's it.	Kanuma.
Mass .	Hanga .
But then he spoke.	Sana booda garuu dubbate.
Very good sense of humor.	Miira qoosaa baayyee gaarii.
It worked more, it worked some.	Caalaatti hojjete, tokko tokko hojjete.
I can't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin danda'u.
We cannot leave our lives behind.	Jireenya keenya duubatti dhiisuu hin dandeenyu.
This need not be a problem.	Kun rakkoo ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
I really didn’t want to play at all.	Dhuguma tasumaa taphachuu hin barbaanne.
But tell me one thing.	Waan tokko garuu natti himi.
You can't think.	Yaadu hin dandeessu.
She would never do any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee gonkumaa hin gootu turte.
It’s just the same thing with me.	Ana waliin waan tokko qofa.
It seems more like.	Caalaatti fakkaata.
But even that hadn’t happened.	Garuu sun illee hin taane ture.
I love, love, love.	Ani nan jaalladha, nan jaalladha, nan jaalladha.
He does a good job.	Hojii gaarii hojjeta.
We are fairly good, but not good enough.	Nuti hamma tokko gaarii dha, garuu gaarii miti.
But you are there.	Ati garuu jirta.
She wasn't so sure.	Isheen hangas mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
She has many ideas.	Yaada hedduu qabdi.
I mean really.	Dhuguma jechuu kooti.
I really don’t want to.	Dhuguma hin barbaadu.
This isn't much.	Kun baay'ee miti.
All that stuff.	Wanti sana hunda.
We both need some sleep.	Lamaan keenyayyuu hirriba xiqqoo nu barbaachisa.
I don't know if it's right or not.	Sirrii ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa hin beeku.
Nothing could be clearer.	Kana caalaa wanti ifa ta’uu danda’u hin jiru.
But I didn’t know that.	Garuu sana hin beeku ture.
But they are not.	Garuu isaan miti.
Things would have been the worst.	Silaa wanti hunda caalaa hamaa ta'a ture.
I think it’s a great idea.	Yaada guddaa natti fakkaata.
But he did it.	Garuu ni godhe.
I want to do it.	Ani hojjechuu barbaada.
Maybe nothing happened.	Tarii homaa hin taane ta'a.
He’s just a human being.	Inni nama qofa.
But it can help.	Garuu gargaaruu danda'a.
That's pretty good.	Sun baayyee gaarii dha.
It was a bit of an accident.	Xiqqoo balaa ture.
I will do it soon.	Dafee nan godha.
You don’t need any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee si hin barbaachisu.
But it wasn’t that simple.	Garuu hangas salphaa hin turre.
You are .	Ati ...dha .
So far that hasn’t happened.	Hanga ammaatti sun hin taane.
They weren’t that great.	Isaan hangas guddaa hin turre.
As if it were.	Akka waan.
He got the money.	Maallaqa argate.
It was the right question he asked.	Gaaffii sirrii inni gaafate ture.
Nobody ever goes there.	Namni gonkumaa achi hin deemu.
That’s a good idea.	Sun yaada gaarii dha.
What was is no more.	Wanti ture kana booda hin jiru.
I will never know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e gonkumaa hin beeku.
I’m with my parents.	Warra koo bira jira.
They had what it takes.	Waan barbaachisu qaban turan.
It doesn't look good.	Gaarii hin fakkaatu.
But not to a great extent.	Garuu hanga guddaa miti.
It has a name.	Maqaa qaba.
You may not know exactly what you need.	Waan si barbaachisu sirriitti beekuu dhiisuu dandeessa.
It was all very important.	Hundi isaa baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
I'm at home.	Ani mana jira.
He couldn’t quite.	Inni guutummaatti hin dandeenye.
Not from her.	Ishee irraa miti.
That was the time.	Yeroon sun akkas ture.
How can you be one of them.	Akkamitti isin keessaa tokko ta'uu dandeessu.
I am looking for answers.	Deebii barbaadaa jira.
It’s not true.	Dhugaa miti.
No one told them they had to do it.	Namni gochuu akka qaban itti hime hin jiru.
People are there for you.	Namoonni siif jiru.
Nothing like that has ever happened.	Wanti akkasii ta'ee hin beeku.
It was pretty easy.	Baay'ee salphaa ture.
But I don't know why, but it's not working.	Garuu maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku, garuu hojjechaa hin jiru.
It’s all very .	Hundi isaa baayyee .
They had a little bit.	Xiqqoo qaban turan.
It didn't matter much.	Baay'ee dhimma hin qabu ture.
I used to love his ideas.	Duraan yaada isaa baay'een jaalladha ture.
I have been working on it.	Irratti hojjechaa tureera.
We did very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjenne.
Now we can’t tell the truth.	Amma dhugaa dubbachuu hin dandeenyu.
That’s how it started.	Akkasitti jalqabe.
I knew the dangers.	Balaa isaa nan beeka ture.
All those things we can see.	Wantoota sana hunda arguu dandeenyu.
Look at the errors.	Dogoggora jiru ilaalaa.
We are your friends.	Nuti hiriyyoota keessan.
So he should know.	Kanaaf beekuu qaba.
Already a good girl.	Duraan intala gaarii.
At that time.	Yeroo sanatti.
He just isn’t in his house.	Inni mana isaa qofa hin jiru.
It didn’t, that’s wrong.	Akkas hin taane, sun dogoggora.
You are with me.	Ati na waliin jirta.
Nothing else to do, really.	Waan biraa hojjechuu hin qabu, dhuguma.
So, she was wrong.	Kanaaf, dogoggora turte.
Something is about to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uuf jedha.
Two months ago.	Ji'a lama dura.
Someone looked at everything.	Namni tokko waan hundumaa ilaale.
Almost like him.	Akka isaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
Not much.	Baay'ee miti.
I am none of these things.	Ani wantoota kana keessaa tokkollee miti.
They have no names.	Maqaa hin qaban.
I gave a little time there.	Yeroo xiqqoo achitti kenne.
Not even for you.	Siif illee miti.
I know more about you than you know yourself.	Waa'ee kee kan ati of beektu caalaa nan beeka.
A good feeling though.	Miira gaarii ta'e garuu.
He knows the food.	Nyaata ni beeka.
That’s one thing.	Sun waan tokko.
Only this and the here and now.	Kanaa fi as fi amma qofa.
She never did it.	Isheen gonkumaa hin goone.
I could have gone there.	Silaa achi deemuun nan dandaʼa ture.
It’s all ours.	Hundi isaa kan keenya.
He only happened once.	Inni yeroo tokko qofa ta'e.
Car.	Konkolaataa.
Perhaps it is a big deal.	Tarii waan guddaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
It's just a question.	Gaaffii qofa.
It wasn’t just me.	Ana qofa hin turre.
I suspect that's probably not the case.	Ani akkas ta'uu hin oolu jedheen shakka.
We are both the same.	Lamaan keenyayyuu tokko.
If only it were that simple.	Osoo akkas salphaa ta'ee.
People really don’t care.	Namoonni dhuguma dhimma hin qaban.
They hadn't talked about it yet.	Hanga ammaatti waa'ee kanaa hin dubbanne turan.
I couldn’t even speak the language.	Afaan sana illee dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
You could have her there, but you don’t.	Achitti ishee qabaachuu dandeessa, garuu hin qabdu.
I came here to work.	Ani hojjechuuf as dhufe.
But they were things he loved.	Garuu wantoota inni jaallatu turan.
Wait, not for us.	Nuuf osoo hin taane eegaa.
But not from this one.	Garuu isa kana irraa miti.
I want to eat this food.	Nyaata kana nyaachuu barbaada.
You don't want to.	Hin barbaaddu.
I couldn’t do the work.	Hojii hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
Maybe she didn't.	Tarii isheen hin goone ta'a.
And he did so again.	Ammas akkas godhe.
They would totally do that.	Silaa guutummaatti akkas godhu turan.
We need our friends.	Hiriyyoota keenya nu barbaachisa.
She did what she could.	Waan dandeessu goote.
That person is just not me.	Namni sun ana miti qofa.
I just told you.	Ani amma sitti hime.
Often, though, this is not the case.	Yeroo baayʼee garuu akkas miti.
Little by little.	Xiqqoo xiqqoo.
I wanted to go back to my car.	Gara konkolaataa kootti deebi'uu barbaade.
But that didn’t happen.	Garuu sun hin taane.
I'm looking at it now.	Amma ilaalaa jira.
Now that would have been something.	Amma silaa sun waan tokko ta'a ture.
I don't know what it used to be.	Ani waan duraan ture hin beeku.
Name of the name.	Maqaa maqaa.
They would soon be parents.	Yeroo dhiyootti warra ta'u turan.
He was one of them.	Inni tokko ture.
This time it's different.	Yeroo kana kan adda ta'e.
It’s going to stay there for a bit.	Xiqqoo achi turuuf deema.
That's how it can work.	Akkasitti hojjechuu danda'a.
That was the way it was for him.	Isaaf akkas ture.
It’s all new.	Hundi isaa haaraa dha.
? 	?
We didn't have much time.	Yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu turre.
I know exactly where you’re going with this.	Kanaan eessa akka deemtu sirriitti beeka.
But it's just.	Garuu qofa.
She didn’t know you well enough.	Isheen akka gaariitti si hin beektu turte.
He lives here.	Inni as jiraata.
They knew what he could do.	Maal gochuu akka dandaʼu ni beeku turan.
But there are.	Garuu ni jiru.
They didn’t have the money.	Maallaqa hin qaban turan.
But what was it like that.	Garuu maal ture akkas ture.
It never seems to go away for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf gonkumaa waan hin deemne fakkaata.
I did not understand how he could do that.	Akkamitti akkas gochuu akka dandaʼu naaf hin galle.
It was a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ture.
I think you’re not good enough.	Ati waan gaarii hin taane natti fakkaata.
Still or never, he thought.	Ammas ta'ee gonkumaa jedhee yaade.
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
I don't know anything.	Ani homaa hin beeku.
This is on me.	Kun ana irra jira.
Of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Maybe not so good.	Tarii hangas gaarii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
I can't go any further.	Kana caalaa deemuu hin danda'u.
This is not entirely accurate.	Kun guutummaatti sirrii miti.
I can still see it, now.	Ammas arguu nan danda'a, amma.
I'm sure she's right.	Isheen sirrii akka taate mirkanaa'adha.
If you do, you should apologize.	Yoo goote dhiifama gaafachuu qabda.
He bought one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko bite.
She was who she was.	Isheen eenyu akka taate turte.
This is my own.	Kun kan kooti.
I had no idea where I was going.	Eessa akkan deemu yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
He’s not alone out there.	Inni achi keessaa kophaa isaa miti.
I can't see anything.	Homaa arguu hin danda'u.
Luckily they do.	Akka carraa ta'ee ni godhu.
No one has ever seen anything like it.	Kan akka isaa namni arge hin jiru.
We’re just playing.	Nuti taphachuu qofa.
They know exactly what is happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeku.
No one answered today.	Har'a namni deebii kenne hin jiru.
I still have no answer.	Ammas deebii hin qabu.
It still works.	Ammas ni hojjeta.
Not sure though.	Mirkanaa'aa miti garuu.
Very soon now, someone will.	Baayyee dhiyootti amma, namni tokko ni ta'a.
I really need to do this.	Kana gochuun baay'ee na barbaachisa.
I still have no idea.	Ammas yaada hin qabu.
It seemed obvious to me.	Ifa natti fakkaate.
I have no desire to do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuuf fedhii tokkollee hin qabu.
That happens more than you think.	Sun waan ati yaaddu caalaa ta'a.
But not tonight.	Garuu halkan kana miti.
But, it’s right.	Garuu, sirrii dha.
Look at each other.	Wal ilaalaa.
As he said.	Akkuma jedhe.
A year has passed.	Waggaa tokko darbe.
It is different in this way.	Haala kanaan adda.
Then I hope it works.	Sana booda akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
It works well now.	Amma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
It may be for a lucky few.	Namoota carraa qaban muraasaaf ta'uu danda'a.

But that was in the past.	Garuu sun kan darbe ture.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
I certainly know that name.	Maqaa sana akkan beeku beekamaadha.
He had a house.	Mana qaba ture.

Then another good day, another good day.	Sana booda guyyaa gaarii kan biraa, guyyaa gaarii kan biraa.
People still have feelings.	Namoonni ammallee miira qabu.
Hopefully someone else will come for him.	Namni biraa akka isaaf dhufu abdii qabna.
I think you should know that part.	Kutaa sana beekuu qabdu jedheen yaada.
I didn't see anything.	Homaa hin argine.
They, of course, had kids who had to go to school tomorrow.	Isaan, beekamaadha, ijoollee boru mana barumsaa deemuu qaban qaban turan.

Everyone had a place.	Namni hundi bakka qaba ture.

We have to do our best for them.	Isaan waan dandeenyu hunda gochuu qabna.
It works, but it works.	Ni hojjeta garuu ni hojjeta.

One of them left the room.	Isaan keessaa tokko kutaa sana keessaa ba'e.
He works in a high-risk department.	Kutaa balaa guddaa qabu keessatti hojjeta.
He was different.	Inni adda ture.

You may never find it.	Tarii gonkumaa argachuu hin dandeessu.

But she was still a girl.	Garuu isheen ammallee intala turte.
She's right.	Isheen sirrii dha.

Not for a moment more.	Yeroo muraasaaf kana caalaa miti.
You can tell us what he said about that.	Waa'ee sanaa maal akka jedhe nuuf himuu dandeessa.

I’m not the only one.	Ani qofa miti.
It was me.	Ana ture.
I thought someone else gave it to me.	Namni biraa waan kenne natti fakkaate.
Working on my hands.	Harka koo irratti hojjechuu.
But he was glad to be back home.	Garuu gara manaatti deebi'uu isaatti gammade.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
All we need is a good man.	Wanti nu barbaachisu nama gaarii qofa.
I couldn’t do anything more to help.	Kana caalaa gargaaruuf homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
He was up to his eyes in them.	Isaan keessa hanga ija isaa ture.
She had no idea they were so dangerous.	Akkas balaa akka qaban yaada hin qabdu turte.
It didn't work.	Hin hojjenne.
But you’re not really like him.	Ati garuu dhuguma akka isaa miti.
No one had any money.	Namni maallaqa hin qabu ture.
But this is.	Garuu kun.
You have an idea.	Yaada qabda.
You can walk on it.	Irra deemuu dandeessa.
He knew that perfectly well.	Sana guutummaatti sirriitti beeka ture.
Wait and see.	Eegaa ilaalaa.
I said maybe.	Tarii jedheen.
At the same time, hope was dangerous.	Kanuma waliin abdiin balaa qaba ture.
No one went away.	Namni tokkollee hin deemne.
We should have told you.	Sitti himuu qabna turre.
Sometimes.	Yeroo tokko tokko.
He couldn't do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenye.
They better do this.	Isaan kana gochuu wayya.
He did so quickly.	Dafee akkas godhe.
It shouldn't have been that big of a deal.	Silaa waan guddaa hangas ta'uu hin qabu ture.
It doesn’t work like that.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu.
It’s a girl.	Intala dha.
They love you for it.	Itti si jaallatu.
But she didn’t know whether to believe it or not.	Garuu amanuu fi dhiisuu ishee hin beektu turte.
But now they don't care.	Amma garuu dhimma hin qaban.
I couldn't have been clearer about that.	Waa'ee sanaa kana caalaa ifa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
Sometimes that’s the case, but not often.	Yeroo tokko tokko akkas ta’a, garuu yeroo baay’ee hin ta’u.
They say it has never been so great.	Akkas guddaa ta'ee hin beeku jedhu.
When you are watching my children.	Yeroo ijoollee koo ilaalaa jirtu.
Maybe in the near future.	Tarii yeroo dhiyootti.
He would speak today.	Har'a ni dubbata ture.
A little about us.	Xiqqoo waa'ee keenya.
That's just not going to happen.	Sun ta'uuf hin deemu qofa.
A new life.	Jireenya haaraa.
No one can do anything.	Namni homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
He knows your name.	Maqaa kee ni beeka.
But that could just be me.	Garuu sun ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
You seem to be in it.	Keessa jirtu fakkaata.
These two knew each other.	Kun lamaan wal beeku turan.
You could see right through them.	Karaa isaanii sirriitti arguu dandeessa turte.
It's not a big deal.	Waan guddaa miti.
It requires real money.	Maallaqa dhugaa barbaada.
But that was as far as it went.	Sun garuu hamma deeme ture.
He still wants to make me his.	Ammas kan isaa na gochuu barbaada.
But you are not there.	Ati garuu hin jirtu.
It wasn’t a duty.	Dirqama hin turre.
He didn't do this.	Kana hin goone.
I can't see you today .	Har'a si arguu hin danda'u .
This was never the case.	Kun tasumaa hin turre.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.	Sun waan hamaa ta'uu hin qabu.
No one said this.	Namni kana jedhe hin jiru.
You never know, something could go wrong up there.	Gonkumaa hin beektu, achi ol wanti tokko dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
Everything was a book.	Wanti hundi kitaaba ture.
Where was it.	Eessa ture.
I don’t have any real food.	Nyaata dhugaa hin qabu.
Maybe he’s nice.	Tarii inni namatti tola.
He had never been.	Inni ta'ee hin beeku ture.
But that is no longer true.	Garuu sun kana booda dhugaa miti.
It came out pretty easy.	Baayyee salphaa ta'ee ba'e.
People knew not to speak around me.	Namoonni naannoo kootti akka hin dubbanne beeku turan.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu homaa hin qabu.
He didn’t want to be here.	Inni as jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
Everyday and not so everyday.	Guyyaa guyyaa fi kan akkas hin taane guyyaa guyyaa.
I know it's you.	Si ta'uu isaa nan beeka.
No one knows about everything.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa namni beeku hin jiru.
That wasn’t good enough.	Sun gaarii hin turre.
What do you look like now.	Waan amma maal fakkaattu.
I hadn’t even seen her.	Ishee illee hin argine ture.
They are looking at the room.	Kutaa sana ilaalaa jiru.
More than you do there.	Achitti gootu caalaa.
This had to be his father.	Kun abbaa isaa ta’uu qaba ture.
And that’s not all.	Kana qofa miti.
I don't even know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e illee hin beeku.
Maybe that’s exactly what happened.	Tarii sirriitti kanuma ta’uu danda’a.
Perhaps he can.	Tarii ni dandaʼa.
I have no idea what to say.	Waan jedhu yaada hin qabu.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu dhimma hin qabu.
I couldn't find it now.	Amma argachuu hin dandeenye.
I knew nothing about it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin beeku ture.
I was going to be inside her today.	Har'a keessa ishee ta'uuf ture.
A very lucky man.	Nama baayyee carraa qabu.
But it didn’t work this time.	Garuu yeroo kana hin hojjenne.
Nothing for you right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana homaa siif hin jiru.
We need them.	Isaan nu barbaachisa.
I know this is not good for him.	Kun isaaf gaarii akka hin taane nan beeka.
I have nothing to say about this.	Kana irratti waanan jedhu hin qabu.
I never wanted to do this again.	Kana booda kana gochuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
It will be too late to do it later.	Booda hojjechuuf yeroon booda ta'a.
This was the house.	Kun mana ture.
I know you don’t know.	Akka hin beekne nan beeka.
This was much worse than he had imagined.	Kun kan inni yaade caalaa baayʼee hamaa ture.
I was going for you.	Siif deemaa ture.
It took several hours.	Sa'aatii hedduu fudhate.
Too much around her.	Garmalee naannoo ishee.
It certainly should be.	Ta’uu akka qabu beekamaadha.
Whatever that might mean.	Sun maal jechuu ta’uu danda’a.
I can't do that to them.	Ani akkas isaan irratti gochuu hin danda'u.
Maybe he was joking about that.	Tarii waa'ee sanaa qoosaa ture ta'a.
But he's doing fine.	Garuu gaarii hojjechaa jira.
It can help.	Gargaaruu danda'a.
They’re really looking at that.	Dhuguma sana ilaalaa jiru.
Only with you.	Si waliin qofa.
It was pretty easy for him.	Isaaf baay'ee salphaa ture.
It has a place.	Bakka qaba.
A long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura.
He’s just teasing you.	Inni sitti qoosaa qofa jira.
While not yours.	Kan kee osoo hin taane.
It's just one night.	Halkan tokko qofa.
It was her money.	Maallaqa ishee ture.
You have to be good before you can be great.	Guddaa ta'uu kee dura gaarii ta'uu qabda.
It couldn't have happened.	Silaa ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
I am not your wife.	Ani haadha manaa kee miti.
Someone had to tell him.	Namni tokko itti himuu qaba ture.
I thought I was telling it that way.	Ani akkasitti himuu natti fakkaate.
The best time of my life.	Yeroo jireenya koo keessatti gaarii ta'e.
Everything we need to know.	Waan beekuu qabnu hunda.
You have to have a picture.	Suuraa qabaachuu qabda.
I haven’t seen it before.	Kana dura hin argine.
But not tonight.	Garuu halkan kana miti.
I would never have known.	Silaa gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
I would never say that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas hin jedhu ture.
He absolutely loves them.	Inni guutummaatti isaan jaallata.
Then none of you will.	Sana booda isin keessaa tokkollee hin godhu.
I wanted to make him like a dog.	Akka saree isa gochuu barbaade.
You can't do much about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan baay'ee gochuu hin dandeessu.
You have everything.	Waan hundumaa qabda.
Not just his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa qofa miti.
It’s not my thing.	Waan koo miti.
You haven’t seen me yet.	Hanga ammaatti na hin argine.
None is required.	Tokkollee hin barbaachisu.
No problem, as you said.	Rakkoo hin qabu akkuma jette.
I thought he was better for me.	Inni naaf wayya jedheen yaade.
A cat, maybe.	Saree tokko, tarii.
Maybe it's possible.	Tarii ta'uu danda'a.
The book is a book.	Kitaaba kitaaba.
You can go there.	Achi deemuu dandeessa.
But it’s more than that.	Garuu kana caalaa.
We have two.	Lama qabna.
We should have had one already.	Silaa amma dura tokko qabaachuu qabna turre.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Tarii boru halkan ta'a.
I sure hope it does.	Akka ta'u abdiin qaba jedheen mirkanaa'adha.
It shouldn’t exist anymore.	Kana booda jiraachuu hin qabu.
Maybe it wasn't.	Tarii hin turre ta'a.
Working, working on.	Hojjechuu, irratti hojjechuu.
He seemed to have it.	Inni waan qabu fakkaata ture.
They often do it.	Yeroo baayyee ni godhu.
They are one thing.	Isaan waan tokko.
I wonder what she did.	Maal goote jedheen yaada.
You were there.	Ati achi turte.
He intended to make you love him.	Akka ati isa jaallattu gochuuf yaade.
It’s just so obvious.	Akkas qofa ifaadha.
She couldn't have known this was bad.	Kun hamaa ta'uu beekuu hin dandeessu turte.
Nothing about it seems like a good idea.	Waa'ee isaa wanti yaada gaarii hin fakkaatu.
But it went no further.	Garuu kana caalaa hin deemne.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
But he knew it was there.	Garuu achi akka jiru ni beeka ture.
Full time.	Yeroo guutuu.
Never, ever, ever.	Yoomiyyuu, yoomiyyuu, yoomiyyuu.
But this is very wrong.	Garuu kun baayyee dogoggora.
What's so special about you.	Waa'ee kee maaltu adda ta'e.
But that's not the case.	Garuu waan kana miti.
That would be going along.	Sun waliin deemaa jiraachuu ta'a.
Look at your hands.	Harka keessan ilaalaa.
Not tomorrow, not next week, but today.	Boru miti, torban dhufu miti, har'a malee.
You have to live your life.	Jireenya kee jiraachuu qabda.
Now, it doesn't.	Amma, hin ta'u.
Both of these are good.	Kun lamaan isaaniiyyuu gaarii dha.
We'll check it out.	Ni ilaalaa.
One of them asked another question.	Isaan keessaa tokko gaaffii biraa gaafate.
We must have gone two or three times.	Yeroo lama sadii deemne ta’uu qaba.
He tried two.	Lama yaale.
It was insensitive.	Miira hin qabne ture.
Everything is going well .	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee deemaa jira .
After a while I think of nothing.	Yeroo muraasa booda homaa hin yaadu.
Sorry it’s just not like that.	Dhiifama akkas miti qofa.
Good sounding.	Sagalee gaarii.
Right then and there.	Yeroo sanatti sirriitti.
It may never do anything good.	Yoomiyyuu waan gaarii tokkollee hojjechuu dhiisuu danda’a.
I can't really help you.	Dhuguma si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Time is over man.	Yeroon nama ol.
But he was in good shape.	Garuu haala gaarii irra ture.
So much longer.	Kanaaf baay'ee dheeraa.
We disagreed as to whether this was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ta'uu fi dhiisuu isaa irratti walii hin galle.
He stared at him for a long moment.	Yeroo dheeraaf ija keessa isa ilaale.
This was one guy.	Kun gurbaa tokko ture.
I'm sure of that now.	Sana amma mirkanaa'aa dha.
Why you should vote.	Maaliif sagalee kennuu qabdu.
Oh! 	Maaloo!
He obviously isn’t.	Inni akka hin taane ifaadha.
I wanted to be different.	Anis adda ta'uu barbaade.
In my case it worked without it.	Dhimma koo irratti isa malee hojjete.
But it really wasn’t that late.	Garuu dhuguma hangas booda hin turre.
But this is my life.	Garuu kun jireenya kooti.
Nothing going on in the afternoon.	Waaree booda wanti itti deemu hin jiru.
It was on her tongue.	Afaan ishee irra ture.
This language is somewhat vague.	Afaan kun hamma tokko ifa miti.
They were in the light.	Isaan ifa keessa turan.
Nobody likes ideas anymore.	Kana booda namni yaada jaallatu hin jiru.
He couldn't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
It may not even exist.	Jiraachuu illee dhiisuu danda’a.
But this was a joke.	Garuu kun qoosaa ture.
Now it works well so far.	Amma hanga ammaatti akka gaariitti hojjeta.
I didn’t really think about it.	Dhuguma itti hin yaadne.
I think this is completely inaccurate.	Kun guutummaatti sirrii miti jedheen yaada.
But it wouldn't be me.	Garuu ana hin ta'u ture.
I think it’s important.	Barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
Not on the whole picture.	Suuraa guutuu irratti miti.
This was a frequent occasion.	Yeroon kun yeroo baayʼee ture.
With so much else you can do.	Waan biraa baay'ee hojjechuu dandeessu waliin.
That can’t be the case here.	Asitti akkas ta’uu hin danda’u.
Who are we?	Nuti eenyu.
She doesn’t seem to understand.	Isheen waan hin hubanne fakkaata.
It required more than hope.	Abdii qabaachuu caalaa waan baayʼee barbaada ture.
No one would ever know.	Namni tokkollee gonkumaa hin beeku ture.
No one will do it for you.	Namni siif godhu hin jiru.
But again, it's just my opinion.	Garuu ammas yaada koo qofa.
He went through it.	Isa keessa darbe.
I don't know him.	Ani isa hin beeku.
They didn’t.	Isaan hin taane.
That was where he wanted to be right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana bakka inni ta'uu barbaade sana ture.
They are good people.	Isaan namoota gaarii dha.
Look, we don’t care.	Ilaalaa nuti dhimma hin qabnu.
It came with nothing.	Homaa tokko malee dhufe.
This stuff was everywhere.	Wanti kun bakka hunda ture.
I want to do more than just see.	Arguu qofa osoo hin taane waan biraa hojjechuu barbaada.
In those days.	Bara sanatti.
Then we had to leave.	Sana booda deemuun dirqama ture.
It was very clear .	Baayyee ifa ture .
I'm sure it doesn't.	Akka hin taane mirkanaa'adha.
He can see it.	Inni arguu danda'a.
They can do this.	Kana gochuu dandaʼu.
But something has to happen, so just tell me.	Garuu wanti tokko ta'uu qaba, kanaaf natti himi qofa.
I would have done this.	Silaa kana nan godha ture.
They couldn't be real.	Isaan dhugaa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
With all those people.	Namoota sana hunda waliin.
I say not at all.	Ani tasumaa miti jedha.
It had been quite a day.	Guyyaa baay'ee ta'ee ture.
This will be the answer.	Kun deebii isaa ta’a.
I still didn’t know her name.	Ammas maqaa ishee hin beeku ture.
And I did my thing.	Anis waan koo godhe.
I don't understand the money.	Maallaqa naaf hin galle.
I love how it looks now.	Amma akkamitti akka fakkaatu baay'een jaalladha.
A good father.	Abbaa gaarii.
Not much here.	Asitti baay'ee miti.
He doesn’t like to play outside.	Ala taphachuu hin jaallatu.
I would never do that to us.	Ani gonkumaa akkas nu hin godhu ture.
One cannot know otherwise.	Namni tokko waan akkas hin taane beekuu hin danda’u.
It was a good episode.	Kutaa gaarii ture.
I won’t do that anymore.	Kana booda akkas hin godhu.
He was a man like himself.	Nama akka isaa ture.
He wanted something he could do on his own.	Waan ofuma isaatiin hojjechuu dandaʼu barbaade.
It was very true.	Baayyee dhugaa ture.
She needs my help.	Gargaarsa koo ishee barbaachisa.
I know that much.	Ani hanga sana beeka.
That’s how you have to live.	Akkasitti jiraachuu qabda.
That's just how it happened.	Akkasitti qofa ta'e.
He just didn’t do anything.	Homaa hin goone qofa.
She has children.	Ijoollee qabdi.
That's how it happens.	Akkas ta'a.
To help you both.	Lamaan keessan gargaaruuf.
But this seems to be what happened.	Garuu waan ta'e kana fakkaata.
You will need to go for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf akka deemtu si barbaachisa.
But it was nothing.	Garuu homaa hin turre.
I want to do what is right.	Waan sirrii taʼe hojjechuu nan barbaada.
I recognize that voice.	Sagalee sana nan beeka.
So she still has problems.	Kanaaf ammallee rakkoo qabdi.
I just didn't think this would happen.	Kun ni ta'a jedhee qofa hin yaadne.
I really don’t know what to do next.	Dhuguma kana booda maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
They are good children.	Ijoollee gaarii dha.
She had no idea.	Yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
It would still work.	Ammas ni hojjeta ture.
I could have made a big mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa hojjechuu nan dandaʼa ture.
As they all have.	Akkuma hundi isaanii qaban.
With a guy.	Gurbaa tokko waliin.
Tell them why it has to be that way.	Maaliif akkas ta'uu akka qabu itti himi.
I couldn't see it.	Arguu hin dandeenye.
This is very, very wrong!!!.	Kun baayyee baayyee dogoggora!!!.
I just have nowhere else to go.	Bakka biraa itti deemu qofa hin qabu.
I will say it again.	Ammas nan jedha.
I was almost in a good mood.	Miira gaarii keessa ture jechuun ni danda'ama.
He started talking about his wife again.	Ammas waa'ee haadha manaa isaa dubbachuu jalqabe.
They are with me.	Ana waliin jiru.
It’s not my business.	Dhimma koo miti.
Then they come here.	Sana booda as dhufu.
I can't believe it.	Ani amanuu hin danda'u.
It all seemed unreal.	Hundi isaa waan dhugaa hin taane fakkaata ture.
But not in this one.	Garuu isa kana keessatti miti.
Why is that happening.	Maaliif akkas ta'a.
That you were here.	Akka ati as turte.
Then he thought again.	Sana booda ammas yaade.
Maybe then it would be.	Tarii yeroo sana ni ta'a ture.
I didn’t want to do this alone.	Kana kophaa koo gochuu hin barbaanne.
You have them.	Isaan qabda.
Ours was a noisy school.	Kan keenya mana barumsaa sagalee guddaa qabu ture.
I've said with whom.	Eenyu waliin jedheen jira.
I just couldn’t that day.	Guyyaa sana qofa hin dandeenye.
Now we are alone.	Amma kophaa keenya.
But this was home.	Garuu kun mana ture.
I am alone in my house.	Mana koo keessa kophaa koo jira.
I am going to be a father.	Ani abbaa ta'uuf deema.
So, he becomes.	Kanaaf, inni ta'a.
It was a mistake.	Dogoggora ture.
I love you more than you do.	Isin caalaa isin jaalladha.
You are all here.	Hundi keessan as jirtu.
They know exactly what is happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru sirriitti beeku.
This, however, was a mistake.	Kun garuu dogoggora ture.
It may contain errors.	Dogoggora of keessaa qabaachuu danda’a.
I was good enough.	Ani gaarii gahaa ture.
But, again, this is different.	Garuu, ammas, kun adda.
Time, accuracy.	Yeroo, sirrii ta'uu.
That's a lot.	Sun baayyee.
The one that's great.	Kan guddaa ta'e.
We have two reasons for this.	Kanaaf sababa lama qabna.
You just didn’t need a book.	Kitaaba qofa hin barbaachifne.
This is not clear.	Kun ifa miti.
I walk into something.	Waan tokko keessa nan deema.
I am not a parent.	Ani warra miti.
If we don’t, who will?.	Yoo hin goone eenyutu godha?.
Not too much though.	Garmalee miti garuu.
I was in retreat.	Ani duubatti deebi'uu keessa ture.
It can only be a good thing.	Waan gaarii qofa ta'uu danda'a.
That was a terrible thing.	Sun waan hamaa ture.
None of them would work.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin hojjetu ture.
That's how it should be.	Akkas ta'uu qaba.
How did you not tell us.	Akkamitti nutti hin himne.
But he can't.	Garuu hin danda'u.
I was about to do it.	Anis gochuuf jedheen ture.
Husband and wife.	Abbaa manaa fi haadha manaa.
It was just what happened.	Waan ta'e qofa ture.
You can’t give it hope.	Abdii itti kennuu hin dandeessu.
Not you, not them.	Ati miti isaan miti.
He had three children.	Ijoollee sadii qaba ture.
Most of the time he was right.	Yeroo baayʼee sirrii ture.
Now he looked at his hand.	Amma harka isaa ilaale.
It used to be pretty bad.	Duraan baayyee hamaa ture.
That was me, now.	Sun ana ture, amma.
It works really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
He told me all about them.	Waa'ee isaanii hunda natti hime.
I didn't tell him.	Ani itti hin himne.
I really doubt it.	Dhuguma nan shakka.
She has to answer.	Deebii kennuu qabdi.
I hope we never have to again.	Kana booda gonkumaa akka hin qabne abdiin qaba.
Other than that we have nothing more.	Sana ala kana caalaa homaa hin qabnu.
I’ve known her for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ishee beeka.
Maybe you won't.	Tarii hin gootu ta'a.
Otherwise, you must tell us what happens.	Kanaan ala waan ta'u nutti himuu qabdu.
I’m glad I did it.	Hojjechuu kootti gammadeera.
You can’t just walk away.	Deemuu qofa hin dandeessu.
It was a lot, it was a lot.	Baay'ee ture, baay'ee ture.
They weren’t good enough.	Isaan gaarii hin turre.
A name you would know.	Maqaa silaa beektu.
It works well, for the most part.	Akka gaariitti hojjeta, irra caalaa.
Something special.	Waan adda ta'e.
But he doesn't go.	Garuu hin deemu.
We can't do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin dandeenyu.
We weren’t interested.	Fedhii hin qabnu turre.
Comments and stuff like that.	Yaada kennuu fi waan akkasii.
But now there was no time.	Amma garuu yeroon hin turre.
There is no one like him.	Namni akka isaa hin jiru.
We were once human.	Yeroo tokko nama turre.
Like almost everything else inside me.	Akkuma waan keessa koo jiru hunda jechuun ni danda'ama.
Two, it couldn’t survive.	Lama, jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
It was this man.	Nama kana ture.
But it seems.	Garuu fakkaata.
I didn’t understand anything anymore.	Kana booda homaa naaf hin galle.
But it didn’t happen.	Garuu hin taane.
It’s a dangerous question.	Gaaffii balaa ta’a.
I saw him yesterday.	Kaleessa isa arge.
This is probably not easy.	Kun salphaa ta’uu hin oolu.
It happened in nothing.	Homaa keessaa ta'e.
She was clear enough.	Isheen gahaa ta'ee ifa turte.
I enjoyed it.	Itti gammade.
It was an important thing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan barbaachisaa ture.
Something out there, mostly.	Waan ala jiru, irra caalaa.
Something a little more sinister.	Waan xiqqoo caalaa hamaa ta'e.
They would all be together in a small room.	Hundi isaanii kutaa xiqqoo tokko keessa waliin ta'u turan.
Everything he said was enough.	Wanti inni dubbate hundi gahaa ture.
I really didn’t know what to say.	Dhuguma maal akkan jedhu hin beeku ture.
Tell them the truth.	Dhugaa jiru itti himi.
Here, it was nothing.	Asitti, homaa hin turre.
I wanted to make that different.	Waan sana adda gochuu barbaade.
A long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura.
But I want to.	Ani garuu nan barbaada.
We are not a threat.	Nuti balaa miti.
He should have stopped talking.	Dubbachuu dhiisuu qaba ture.
Maybe she didn’t have it.	Tarii hin qabdu turte.
I have a lot of stuff to do.	Waan hojjechuu qabu baay'een qaba.
I could still see him.	Ammallee isa arguu nan dandaʼa ture.
With someone else.	Nama biraa waliin.
Are you the one?.	Ati moo?.
Which is absolutely fine.	Kan guutummaatti gaarii dha.
They always want what someone else has.	Yeroo hundumaa waan namni biraa qabu barbaadu.
I know the truth.	Dhugaa jiru nan beeka.
That was the biggest thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa guddaa taʼe sun ture.
It was such an idea.	Yaada akkasii ture.
This, of course, was not true.	Kun, dhugaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
We have been waiting for you all day.	Guyyaa guutuu isin eegaa turre.
There are definitely problems with what is going on.	Waan deemaa jiru irratti rakkoon akka jiru beekamaadha.
He will never know.	Inni yoomiyyuu hin beeku.
Of course, you can’t.	Akka hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
Must have a car.	Konkolaataa qabaachuu qaba.
Again, it's just an idea.	Ammas yaada qofa.
Usually, these people are in a good mood.	Yeroo baayyee, namoonni kun miira gaarii keessa jiru.
She has some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko qabdi.
Great feeling.	Miira guddaa.
But he couldn't say.	Garuu jechuu hin dandeenye.
Just helping out.	Gargaaruu qofa.
I know mine does.	Kan koo akka godhu nan beeka.
Now that’s not such a good idea.	Amma sun yaada gaarii akkasii miti.
He made it happen.	Inni akka ta'u godhe.
Maybe there's something he can do.	Tarii wanti inni gochuu danda'u jiraachuu danda'a.
He’s not doing so well.	Inni akkas gaarii hojjechaa hin jiru.
But it is a house.	Garuu mana dha.
But not entirely.	Garuu guutummaatti miti.
I don’t know if you know how this works.	Kun akkamitti akka hojjetu beekuu keessan hin beeku.
If you don’t do a good job.	Yoo hojii gaarii hin hojjenne.
Didn't know what it was.	Maal akka ta'e hin beekne.
He knew him well enough.	Inni akka gaariitti isa beeka ture.
This was not where she wanted to be.	Kun bakka isheen ta'uu barbaaddu hin turre.
I was really a new person with him.	Dhuguma nama haaraa isa waliin ture.
He was really involved.	Dhuguma harka keessaa qaba ture.
We cannot ask what it means.	Maal jechuu akka ta'e gaafachuu hin dandeenyu.
There's a	Achi keessaa .
But they needed good luck.	Garuu carraa gaarii isaan barbaachisa ture.
No one comes to her.	Namni gara ishee dhufu hin jiru.
Now he thought.	Amma jedhee yaade.
He had a chance.	Carraa qaba ture.
We still have one.	Ammas tokko qabna.
He didn’t stay there long.	Yeroo dheeraa achi hin turre.
But you can probably date it almost exactly.	Garuu tarii sirriitti jechuun ni danda'ama guyyaa itti himuu dandeessa.
Nothing vague about it.	Waa'ee isaa wanti ifa hin taane hin jiru.
I think about it every day, every night.	Guyyaa hunda, halkan hunda itti yaada.
He wants her.	Ishee barbaada.
She didn’t know if she had a nickname before.	Kanaan dura maqaa maqaa ijoollee qabduu hin beektu turte.
He wanted so badly to believe her.	Ishee amanuu akka malee barbaade.
Then he saw them.	Sana booda isaan arge.
You know, you don’t even have to do this.	Beektaa kana gochuu illee hin qabdu.
I'm sure it will happen.	Akka ta'u mirkanaa'adha.
They are my friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota kooti.
He had to help him this time.	Yeroo kana isa gargaaruu qaba ture.
It couldn't be right.	Sirrii ta'uu hin dandeenye.
He went on it.	Irratti deeme.
Not many of them.	Isaan keessaa baay'ee miti.
But it had to be.	Garuu ta'uu qaba ture.
He was just teasing me.	Inni natti qoosaa qofa ture.
We had you here last year.	Bara darbe asitti si qabna turre.
He thought everything would be fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii ta'a jedhee yaade.
Get back to it.	Itti deebi'i.
Finding and much like.	Argachuu fi baay'ee akka.
He's doing something.	Waan tokko hojjechaa jira.
You don't care.	Ati dhimma hin qabdu.
I enjoyed it.	Itti gammadeera.
This is where we should meet.	Bakka wal arguu qabnu kana.
Every night was a little different .	Halkan hundi xiqqoo adda ture .
See what happens.	Waan ta'u ilaalaa.
He always knew he wasn’t that person.	Yeroo hundumaa nama sana akka hin taane beeka ture.
He could have known.	Silaa beekuu danda'a ture.
I can't do that again.	Ammas akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
But it's nothing.	Garuu homaa ta'a.
But you are not there yet.	Ati garuu ammallee hin jirtu.
There is no one to help me.	Namni na gargaaru hin jiru.
They were still there.	Ammas ni turan.
We have to play well.	Akka gaariitti taphachuu qabna.
I have nothing else of my own.	Waan of biraa hin qabu.
This thing doesn’t have that problem.	Wanti kun rakkoo sana hin qabu.
But you didn't do that.	Ati garuu akkas hin goone.
I couldn’t see her.	Ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
Maybe even that one.	Tarii inni sun illee ta'uu danda'a.
No one has ever seen anything like it.	Namni waan akkasii arge hin jiru.
No problems so far.	Hanga ammaatti rakkoo hin qabu.
It’s better if you don’t.	Yoo hin taane wayya.
It wasn’t a problem.	Rakkoo hin turre ture.
I have it now.	Amma qaba.
Tell him everything.	Waan hundumaa itti himi.
This is the correct answer.	Kun deebii sirrii dha.
So easy to do it.	Kanaaf salphaa ta'ee hojjechuuf.
I was extremely happy.	Garmalee gammadeera.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
He had to go now.	Amma deemuu qaba ture.
I couldn’t get the same feeling.	Miira wal fakkaatu argachuu hin dandeenye.
Not everyone is like that.	Namni hundi akkas miti.
But they knew very little.	Garuu waan baay'ee xiqqoo beeku turan.
You have to work when you have to work.	Yeroo hojjechuu qabdu hojjechuu qabda.
That this is how things happen.	Wanti akkasitti akka ta'u.
But that wasn’t always the case.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre.
They weren’t bad people.	Namoota hamaa hin turre.
It really didn’t happen.	Dhuguma hin taane.
Just a little, but it was enough.	Xiqqoo qofa, garuu gahaa ture.
No one asked me to do it.	Namni akkan godhu na gaafate hin jiru.
Sometimes you need it.	Yeroo tokko tokko si barbaachisa.
But now things are different.	Amma garuu wanti jiru adda.
Who doesn’t.	Kan hin goone.
I thought it was a joke.	Qoosaa natti fakkaate.
I like the question.	Gaaffii natti tola.
They will be some of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko tokko ta’u.
He is the most dangerous.	Inni hunda caalaa balaa qaba.
No one will be.	Namni tokkollee hin ta'u.
This is with our lives.	Kun jireenya keenya waliin.
That's an issue.	Sun dhimma.
This is not true at all.	Kun tasumaa dhugaa miti.
Someone else already said that.	Namni biraa duruu akkas jedhe.
Not that lucky, of course.	Carraa sanaa miti, beekamaadha.
Not one and the same.	Tokko fi tokko miti.
It’s not that kind of night.	Halkan akkasii miti.
They are doing a terrible job.	Hojii hamaa hojjechaa jiru.
It must be food.	Nyaata ta'uu qaba.
I wouldn’t intend to do it.	Ani gochuuf hin yaadu ture.
That one didn’t see me.	Inni sun na hin argine.
This morning	Har'a ganama .
That's not good.	Sun gaarii miti.
She needed to know where he was.	Bakka inni jiru beekuu qabdi turte.
He was the only one who could.	Kan danda'u isa qofa ture.
A couple of days is no problem.	Guyyaa lama lama rakkoo hin qabu.
My name with him for this life.	Jireenya kanaaf maqaa koo isa waliin.
I and.	Ani fi.
He worked with him.	Isa waliin hojjete.
It would be lonely.	Kophaa ta'a ture.
I enjoyed it.	Ani itti gammade.
We stayed with her for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf ishee waliin turre.
That thing was huge.	Wanti sun guddaa ture.
Like, he doesn’t have that.	Akka, inni sana hin qabu.
It works very well for me.	Baayyee gaarii naaf hojjeta.
Last time I was a year ago I went through it all.	Yeroon darbe waggaa tokko dura ture hunda keessa darbe.
There’s something else you need to do.	Wanti biraa hojjechuu qabdu jira.
I always loved being home, always.	Yeroo hundumaa mana jiraachuu nan jaalladha ture, yeroo hundumaa.
He is a human being.	Nama dha.
That’s how everything becomes their problem.	Akkasitti wanti hundi rakkoo isaanii ta’a.
But he had done nothing good.	Garuu waan gaarii tokkollee hin goone ture.
What can I tell you	Maal sitti himi .
It just works really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti qofa hojjeta.
They weren’t the only ones.	Isaan qofa hin turre.
But it was very important in those days.	Bara sanatti garuu baayʼee barbaachisaa ture.
All we have today .	Hundi har'a qabnu .
It requires a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee barbaada.
I didn’t see anything else.	Waan biraa hin argine.
Evil and truth.	Hamaa fi dhugaa.
She has nothing.	Homaa hin qabdu.
Maybe they know all about you.	Tarii waa'ee kee hunda beeku ta'a.
Someone is in the room with me.	Namni tokko na waliin kutaa keessa jira.
That wasn’t the case today.	Har’a akkas hin turre.
It will be soon.	Dafee ta'a.
I'm sure a lot of people have, but not all of them.	Namoonni baay'een akka qaban mirkanaa'adha, garuu hunda isaanii miti.
But you know how it works.	Garuu akkamitti akka hojjetu beekta.
It was pretty good, but easy.	Baayyee gaarii ture, garuu salphaa ture.
But it is not his.	Kan isaa garuu miti.
She didn’t know any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin beektu turte.
Which is exactly right.	Kan sirriitti sirrii ta'e.
It's just not very big.	Baay'ee guddaa miti qofa.
He wasn’t doing anything.	Homaa hojjechaa hin turre.
That’s why they’re here.	Kanaaf as jiru.
He doesn’t like it with kids.	Ijoollee waliin hin jaallatu.
That’s not a big deal.	Sun waan guddaa miti.
What he has to do.	Waan inni gochuu qabu.
No one should know.	Namni beekuu hin qabu.
I know it was nothing more than a night.	Halkan tokko caalaa homaa akka hin taane nan beeka.
That would be enough.	Sun gahaa ta’a ture.
Not loud, not screaming.	Sagalee guddaa hin qabu, iyyuu miti.
You know where you’re going.	Bakka deemtu ni beekta.
He didn't have any.	Tokkollee hin qabu ture.
He has a house there.	Achitti mana qaba.
It could be someone else's.	Kan nama biraa ta'uu danda'u.
You better get it.	Ati argachuu wayya.
Everything looks different.	Wanti hundi adda fakkaata.
But it won't be enough.	Garuu gahaa hin ta'u.
I have nothing more to say.	Kana caalaa waanan jedhu hin qabu.
Maybe we were.	Tarii nuti turre ta'a.
This one seems to be an exception.	Inni kun waan ala ta’e fakkaata.
If it were.	Osoo ta'ee.
He spoke for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf dubbata ture.
I want to be a guy.	Ani gurbaa ta'uu barbaada.
But he knows he's right.	Garuu sirrii akka ta'e beeka.
It's just bad.	Hamaa qofa.
She still had no idea.	Ammallee yaada tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
Probably not.	Tarii ta'uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
But it's okay if this isn't you.	Garuu kun si hin taane yoo ta'e homaa miti.
Doing them tomorrow.	Boru isaan gochuu.
But they had me.	Garuu na qaban turan.
I think it’s a mistake.	Dogoggora natti fakkaata.
But this time was different.	Yeroon kun garuu adda ture.
They weren’t so obvious.	Isaan akkas ifa hin turre.
It's not going to be a big deal.	Waan guddaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
It is not easy to do.	Gochuun salphaa miti.
I can't get a car.	Konkolaataa argachuu hin danda'u.
You are not in any trouble.	Rakkoo tokkollee keessa hin jirtu.
Now that’s good money.	Amma sun maallaqa gaarii dha.
They are in here .	Isaan as keessa jiru .
She had to admit that he had done well.	Inni gaarii akka godhe amanuu qabdi turte.
That’s who you really are.	Dhuguma eenyu akka taate kanuma.
It just took a job.	Hojii qofa fudhate.
But someone else was there.	Garuu namni biraa achi ture.
I could do that now, you know.	Amma akkas gochuu nan danda'a ture, beekta.
It can be a lot.	Baay’ee ta’uu danda’a.
We had a lot in common.	Waan baay'ee wal fakkaatu qabna turre.
He would have been a good man if anything had happened.	Osoo wanti tokko ta'e nama gaarii ta'a ture.
You can do this in many ways.	Kana karaa hedduu gochuu dandeessa.
He was more than happy.	Inni caalaatti gammade.
This was going to happen sooner.	Kun dafee ta'uuf ture.
I always thought everyone knew this.	Yeroo hundumaa kana namni hundi ni beeka jedheen yaada ture.
But you don’t have to do that.	Garuu akkas gochuun dirqama miti.
We were the same people we used to be.	Namoota duraan turre sana turre.
But this night was different.	Garuu halkan kun adda ture.
But we had no idea.	Garuu yaada tokkollee hin qabnu turre.
We need more than that.	Kana caalaa nu barbaachisa.
If he asks you, back me up.	Yoo si gaafate na duubatti deebi'i.
Not in sleep.	Hirriba keessa miti.
It may not be obvious, but it’s important.	Ifa ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a, garuu barbaachisaa dha.
It worked very well for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf baayyee gaarii hojjete.
Good all around conditions.	Haala hunda naannoo gaarii.
I think they really like each other.	Dhuguma wal jaallatu jedheen yaada.
I'm looking at this one today.	Isa kana har'a ilaalaa jira.
It's not even supposed to be that funny.	Akkasitti qoosaa ta'uu illee hin qabu.
I can buy that.	Sana bitachuu nan danda'a.
They weren't home much.	Isaan baay'ee mana hin turre.
Fortunately, no one was in there.	Akka carraa ta'ee namni achi keessa hin turre.
No one could find it.	Namni argachuu hin dandeenye.
It must be something.	Waan tokko ta'uu qaba.
I couldn't live in that.	Sana keessa jiraachuu hin danda'u ture.
This wasn’t another girl.	Kun intala biraa hin turre.
Maybe, it's something else.	Tarii, waan biraa ta'uu danda'a.
More than this time.	Yeroo kana caalaa.
Neither of you spoke.	Lamaan keessan illee hin dubbanne.
It wasn’t all bad.	Hundi isaa hamaa hin turre.
He’s not looking at me.	Inni na ilaalaa hin jiru.
We have nothing in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu hin qabnu.
I knew my father.	Abbaa koo nan beeka ture.
I love everything he does.	Waan inni hojjetu hunda nan jaalladha.
These are like	Isaan kun akka .
Those people want their kids.	Namoonni sun ijoollee isaanii barbaadu.
I don't know with whom.	Eenyu waliin akka ta'e hin beeku.
They are in this new place.	Bakka haaraa kana keessa jiru.
This whole life.	Jireenya kana guutuu.
Why is it? 	Maaliif?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
He asked about you.	Waa'ee kee gaafate.
He has no children, however.	Ijoollee hin qabu garuu.
We didn’t understand.	Nuti hin hubanne.
But look at us.	Garuu nu ilaalaa.
Have a matter.	Dhimma qabaa.
I have that.	Ani akkas qaba.
But now he was himself again.	Amma garuu ammas ofii isaa ta'e.
I hope this is not the case.	Kun akkas akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
He could very well see what happened.	Waan ta’e baay’ee gaarii ta’ee arguu danda’a ture.
It never happened before.	Duraan akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
Getting a chance to play this year.	Bara kana carraa taphachuu argachuu.
But not my real mother.	Garuu haadha koo isa dhugaa miti.
I thought it was right.	Sirrii natti fakkaate.
It had to be with the two of us.	Lamaan keenya waliin ta'uu qaba ture.
It was just a joke, of course.	Qoosaa qofa akka ture beekamaadha.
We all have them.	Hundi keenya isaan qabna.
Maybe I'll find something out about it.	Tarii waa'ee kanaa waan tokko argachuu danda'a.
They are watching us.	Nu ilaalaa jiru.
One problem will be about school.	Rakkoon tokko waa'ee mana barumsaa ta'a.
It should be good.	Gaarii ta'uu qaba.
He looked into her eyes again.	Ammas ija keessa ilaale.
Thing, not so much.	Wanti, hangas miti.
You can play it two ways.	Karaa lama taphachuu dandeessa.
I want you too much.	Garmalee si barbaada.
He didn't tell us about who we were.	Waa'ee eenyu akka taane nutti hin himne.
I think that might be good.	Sun gaarii ta'uu danda'a jedheen yaada.
In ideal operating conditions.	Haala hojii gaarii ta'e keessatti.
Not necessary this year.	Bara kana barbaachisaa miti.
It was never even a thought.	Yaada illee ta'ee hin beeku.
It seems like you need it in this case.	Haala kana keessatti waan si barbaachisu fakkaata.
I am certainly not.	Ani akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That’s what my man did here.	Kan namni koo asitti godhe kanuma.
I really wanted a girl.	Intala tokko baay'een barbaada ture.
I have another question.	Gaaffii biraa qaba.
All the good stuff.	Wantoota gaarii hunda.
To be a little bit.	Xiqqoo ta’uuf.
I couldn't say exactly why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
I don’t have to play friends.	Hiriyyoota taphachuu hin qabu.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
They outperform humans in both cases.	Haala lamaan keessatti nama caalaa hojjetu.
He knows everything he needs to know.	Waan beekuu qabu hunda ni beeka.
This is my issue.	Kun dhimma kooti.
Everything was in good shape.	Wanti hundi haala gaarii irra ture.
That will never happen.	Sun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
You know everything about me now.	Waa'ee koo waan hundumaa amma beekta.
It began to become clearer.	Ifa ta’uu jalqabe.
It was a good feeling.	Miira gaarii ture.
Be in the present moment.	Yeroo ammaa keessa ta'aa.
Lucky you don’t have time.	Carraa qaba ati yeroo hin qabdu.
I want to know.	Ani beekuu barbaada.
I almost love him so much.	Baay'een isa jaalladha jechuun ni danda'ama.
He certainly went through a lot.	Waan baay'ee keessa akka darbe beekamaadha.
You know, not me, but us.	Ati beekta malee ana miti, nuti.
But, of course, that’s okay.	Garuu, beekamaadha, sun homaa miti.
This should have worked.	Kun hojjechuu qaba ture.
Not sure if he does that.	Sana gochuu fi dhiisuu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
Exactly what she needs.	Sirriitti waan ishee barbaachisu.
I think it is so obvious.	Akkas ifaadha jedheen yaada.
It’s nothing more than that.	Kana caalaa homaa miti.
It's true, it's true.	Dhugaa, dhugaa ta'e.
I know you want to.	Akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
It always works.	Yeroo hunda hojjeta.
I think that's about right.	Sun waa'ee sirrii natti fakkaata.
He hadn’t done his job.	Hojii isaa hin hojjenne ture.
I just, really .	Ani qofa, dhuguma .
I’ve always said that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas jedheen ture.
We all have to believe her.	Hundi keenya ishee amanuu qabna.
I didn't want to believe it.	Anis amanuu hin barbaanne.
Again, not my mother at all.	Ammas, tasumaa haadha koo miti.
It can exist without certainty.	Mirkanaa’aa malee jiraachuu danda’a.
She didn't know why she had to say anything.	Maaliif waan tokko dubbachuu akka qabdu hin beektu turte.
You cannot do this work alone.	Hojii kana kophaa kee hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
That seems about right.	Sun waa'ee sirrii fakkaata.
Mostly I don’t have time.	Irra caalaa yeroo hin qabu.
We have our own.	Kan keenya qabna.
He was one of her friends.	Hiriyyoota ishee keessaa tokko ture.
It was going to be a long night.	Halkan dheeraa ta'uuf ture.
You can have your own.	Kan kee qabaachuu dandeessa.
There was no time to tell him.	Yeroon itti himu hin turre.
That’s when it started.	Yeroo sanatti jalqabe.
There was no one else.	Namni biraa hin turre.
Shouldn't see much.	Baay'ee arguu hin qabu.
But a lot of them are good ones.	Garuu baay'een isaanii warra gaarii dha.
They are absolutely right.	Isaan guutummaatti sirrii dha.
Now she is home.	Amma mana taate.
You can around here.	Naannoo asitti ni dandeessu.
That wasn’t always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre.
We didn’t do it alone.	Kophaa keenya hin hojjenne.
But they are a good thing.	Isaan garuu waan gaarii dha.
But just play with him.	Garuu isa waliin taphachuu qofa.
But look around us now.	Garuu amma naannoo keenya ilaalaa.
But still nothing happened.	Ammas garuu wanti ta'e hin jiru.
From not playing.	Taphachuu dhiisuu irraa.
A desire .	Fedhii tokko .
He had to help me with all that.	Sana hunda irratti na gargaaruu qaba ture.
So it never was.	Kanaaf tasumaa hin turre.
I couldn't ask questions.	Gaaffii gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
Very good hands, but not good enough.	Harka baayyee gaarii, garuu gaarii gahaa miti.
You have to believe that.	Sana amanuu qabda.
He had only one answer.	Deebii tokko qofa qaba ture.
They were never friends.	Isaan gonkumaa hiriyyoota hin turre.
It was only a couple of years.	Waggaa lama lama qofa ture.
We were all there.	Hundi keenya achi turre.
We don’t need that here.	Asitti sun nu hin barbaachisu.
I couldn’t believe it worked.	Hojjete jedhee amanuu hin dandeenye.
It’s just what he does.	Waan inni hojjetu qofa.
We need to work together .	Waliin hojjechuu qabna .
He gave them a sense of it.	Isaan kanaaf miira kenne.
This can't really be happening.	Kun dhuguma ta'aa jiraachuu hin danda'u.
It is completely wrong.	Guutummaatti dogoggora.
But there must be something else.	Garuu wanti biraa jiraachuu qaba.
He didn't think about it.	Homaa itti hin yaadne.
All that kind of stuff.	Wantoota akkasii hunda.
I think that’s really something.	Sun dhuguma waan tokko natti fakkaata.
I didn’t want to do that.	Akkas gochuu hin barbaanne.
When you .	Yeroo ati .
Maybe he just didn't understand her.	Tarii ishee qofa hin hubanne ta'a.
There was no one to help me.	Namni na gargaaru hin jiru ture.
They knew her too well.	Garmalee ishee beeku turan.
I'm working on it.	Ani hojjechaa jira.
Once that happened.	Yeroo tokko akkas ta'e.
It may or may not exist.	Jiraachuu fi dhiisuu danda’a.
All you have to do is eat.	Wanti ati gochuu qabdu nyaachuu qofa.
Maybe not today, but some other day.	Tarii har'a osoo hin taane, guyyaa biraa.
He would have sat down.	Silaa taa'a ture.
Everyone wants one.	Namni hundi tokko barbaada.
I wanted to do something to help.	Waan gargaaru tokko gochuun barbaade.
He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t have to.	Homaa hin dubbanne, garuu dirqama hin turre.
That is probably not the case.	Sun taʼuu hin oolu.
They are in plain error.	Dogoggora ifa ta’e keessa jiru.
It should be just one issue.	Dhimma tokko qofa ta’uu qaba.
This is my issue.	Kun dhimma kooti.
It had to be something else.	Waan biraa ta'uu qaba ture.
Just one of many.	Baay'ee keessaa tokko qofa.
This is the right one.	Kun kan sirrii dha.
That’s pretty important in my book.	Kitaaba koo keessatti sun baay’ee barbaachisaa dha.
This seems very similar.	Kun baayyee wal fakkaata fakkaata.
Why of all people it had to be him.	Maaliif namoota hundumaa keessaa isa ta'uu qaba ture.
He has been that good to me.	Inni hangas naaf gaarii ta'ee jira.
I'm right there.	Ani sirriitti achi jira.
Very little girl.	Intala xiqqoo baay'ee.
It will be a must to go.	Deemuun dirqama ta'a.
I couldn’t do any more than I used to.	Kan duraan hojjechaa ture caalaa hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
They were trying to do something different.	Waan adda ta'e hojjechuuf yaalaa turan.
They are by no means alone.	Isaan kun tasumaa kophaa isaanii miti.
Maybe more than enough.	Tarii gahaa ol ta'uu danda'a.
A long time ago.	Yeroo dheeraa dura.
This was not what she wanted.	Kun waan isheen barbaaddu hin turre.
It just can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
Not her mother.	Haadha ishee miti.
People want answers.	Namoonni deebii barbaadu.
Look for them.	Isaan barbaadaa.
Thus, we are here to help you.	Haala kanaan, isin gargaaruuf as jirra.
New things and places.	Waan fi bakka haaraa.
That seems right.	Sun sirrii fakkaata.
I think he's right.	Inni sirrii natti fakkaata.
It was just great.	Guddaa qofa ture.
He thought of everything.	Waan hundumaa yaade.
It's not a bad one.	Kan hamaa miti.
But even that was no big deal.	Garuu sun illee waan guddaa hin turre.
That's what I mean.	Kana jechuu kooti.
Like the kids he thought again.	Akkuma ijoollee ammas yaade.
Clearly, he did not do this.	Kana akka hin goone ifaadha.
Taller than me.	Ana caalaa dheeraa.
This can be good.	Kun gaarii ta’uu danda’a.
But I still wanted more.	Garuu ammas kana caalaa barbaade.
He had to tell her.	Itti himuu qaba ture.
I wouldn’t have said anything.	Silaa homaa hin jedhu ture.
But not this time.	Yeroo kana garuu miti.
But he got it.	Garuu ni argate.
She didn’t do that.	Isheen akkas hin goone.
He knew this was bad.	Kun hamaa akka taʼe ni beeka ture.
It’s a long way to go.	Karaa dheeraa dha.
Helping children with their homework.	Ijoollee hojii manaa isaanii irratti gargaaruu.
But it’s on my name.	Garuu maqaa koo irra jira.
No one else does.	Namni biraa hin godhu.
So that’s what he did.	Kanaaf waan inni godhe kanuma.
Fortunately, that's not entirely the case.	Akka carraa ta'ee, guutummaatti akkas miti.
It is still in operation.	Ammallee hojii irra jira.
Not an easy matter, perhaps.	Dhimma salphaa miti tarii.
This is not the time we need to have now.	Yeroon kun yeroo amma qabaachuu qabnu miti.
It didn't happen exactly.	Sirriitti hin taane.
Everyone needs feedback, all the time.	Namni hundi yaada barbaada, yeroo hunda.
I am not one of them.	Ani isaan keessaa tokkollee miti.
There was no one there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti namni hin jirre ture.
I know you’re right.	Sirrii akka taate nan beeka.
But they do work.	Garuu hojii hojjetu.
I know they are always loud here.	Asitti yeroo hunda sagalee guddaa akka qaban nan beeka.
But that’s usually the case.	Garuu yeroo baay’ee akkas ta’a.
That's what we did today.	Har'a kan hojjenne kanuma.
But he couldn't do anything.	Garuu homaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
That's very dangerous.	Sun baayyee balaa qaba.
That seems like a long time.	Sun yeroo dheeraa fakkaata.
They want to find me.	Na argachuu barbaadu.
Everyone wants that.	Namni hundi sana barbaada.
It better not be anywhere else.	Bakka biraa ta'uu dhiisuu isaa wayya.
I can be what you want me to be.	Ani waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu nan danda'a.
All of you must.	Hundi keessan dirqama.
It's not about you.	Waa'ee kee miti.
They can be what you want.	Isaan waan ati barbaaddu ta'uu danda'u.
I didn’t go this route.	Karaa kana hin deemne.
We really worked very well together.	Dhuguma baayyee gaarii waliin hojjenne.
That’s not the only problem with my mouth.	Rakkoon afaan koo qabu kanuma qofa miti.
Nothing would have happened.	Silaa wanti ta'u hin jiru.
It can't be all that bad.	Hamma kana hunda hamaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
That was a question he could go back on.	Sun gaaffii inni duubatti deebi'uu danda'u ture.
I love that place so much.	Bakka sana baay'een jaalladha.
Sometimes, though, that’s not always good enough.	Yeroo tokko tokko garuu yeroo hunda sun gaarii miti.
I had no books today.	Har'a kitaaba hin qabu ture.
Now, tell me.	Amma, natti himi.
I mean, .	Kana jechuun koo, .
I wouldn't be here otherwise.	Osoo akkas ta'ee as hin jiru ture.
No one spoke to me.	Namni natti dubbate hin jiru.
We are going to do this.	Kana gochuuf jirra.
But one guy came out a little before three.	Garuu gurbaa tokko sadii dura xiqqoo ba'e.
I really needed them.	Dhuguma na barbaachisa turan.
One of the big ones.	Guddaa tokko.
I don't think about that.	Ani waa'ee sanaa hin yaadu.
They are still there.	Ammas achi jiru.
Are you interested in interest?.	Fedhii fedhii qabduu?.
Perhaps she was all of those things.	Tarii isheen wantoota sana hunda turte taʼa.
They should not be doing this.	Kana gochaa jiraachuu hin qaban.
I have to give him that.	Sana isaaf kennuu qaba.
It wasn’t required of him.	Isa irraa hin barbaachifne.
He was in something.	Waan tokko keessa ture.
Maybe, just maybe you can live your life.	Tarii, tarii qofa jireenya kee jiraachuu dandeessa ta'a.
She is very sensitive.	Isheen baayyee miira qabdi.
He is very dangerous.	Inni baayyee balaa qaba.
Now everyone loves it.	Amma namni hundi ni jaallata.
Very different.	Baayyee adda.
It wasn’t her idea.	Yaada ishee hin turre.
It was nothing in those days, you know.	Bara sanatti homaa hin turre beekta.
There was no help for him here.	Asitti gargaarsa tokkollee isaaf hin turre.
But there is hope, still.	Garuu abdiin jira, ammallee.
But not in this case.	Garuu haala kana keessatti miti.
I still don’t know if we can do it.	Ammallee gochuu dandeenyu hin beeku.
She was just trying to help.	Gargaaruu qofa yaalaa turte.
He came out an hour later.	Sa'aatii tokko booda ba'e.
You have to do it often.	Yeroo baay'ee gochuu qabda.
Try the door.	Balbala yaalaa.
We thought it was old, of course.	Durii akka taate yaadne, beekamaadha.
It will still be a matter of time.	Ammas dhimma yeroo ta'a.
I have that, too.	Anis sana qaba.
You don’t like my opinion.	Yaada koo hin jaallattu.
That you want to be.	Akka ati ta'uu barbaaddu.
Just so much anymore.	Kana booda baay'ee qofa.
It was about what she wanted.	Waa'ee waan isheen barbaaddu ture.
I know you have it.	Akka qabdu nan beeka.
Still no one saw him.	Ammas namni isa arge hin jiru.
But I was almost always on time.	Garuu yeroo hunda yeroon ture jechuun ni danda'ama.
I must make you my wife.	Haadha manaa koo si gochuun qaba.
I doubt anyone cared.	Namni dhimma itti ba'e akka hin jirre nan shakka.
You seem to have a problem.	Rakkoo waan qabdu fakkaata.
Something had to happen.	Waan tokko ta'uu qaba ture.
Not that, please not! 	Kana miti, maaloo akkas miti!
. . . .	.
It doesn’t mean us.	Nu jechuu miti.
That’s how they looked.	Akkasitti fakkaatu turan.
That was one question.	Sun gaaffii tokko ture.
But it didn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjenne.
Probably no one does.	Tarii namni tokkollee hin godhu.
Her mouth came out.	Afaan ishee ba'e.
He knew me well enough.	Inni akka gaariitti na beeka ture.
I had the time.	Yeroon qaba ture.
If you don't want to be one yourself.	Yoo ofii kee tokko ta'uu hin barbaanne.
Good luck here.	Halkan carraa gaarii.
She wasn’t important.	Isheen barbaachisaa hin turre.
He loved the moon.	Ji'a ni jaallata ture.
Just look at her outfit.	Uffata ishee qofa ilaalaa.
Maybe a long time.	Tarii yeroo dheeraa ta'uu danda'a.
It’s still a mistake.	Ammallee dogoggora.
They work very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjetu.
Now he had him.	Amma isa qaba ture.
He wanted a drink.	Dhugaatii barbaade.
Tell me where it’s going.	Eessa akka deemu natti himi.
This was unreasonably late.	Kun sababa malee booda ture.
There's no reason to be.	Sababni ta'uuf hin jiru.
I saw her in everywhere.	Bakka hunda keessa ishee arge.
It has been a very bad year.	Bara baayyee hamaa ta'ee ture.
It was all very nice.	Hundi isaa baayyee namatti tola ture.
I mean, it doesn't happen.	Hin ta'u jechuu kooti.
But that’s not such a bad thing.	Garuu sun waan hamaa akkasii miti.
She should have never told him about them.	Silaa waa'ee isaanii gonkumaa itti himuu hin qabdu turte.
I wish it wasn’t.	Osoo hin taane natti tola.
What does he know.	Maal beeka.
He was doing good.	Inni waan gaarii hojjechaa ture.
This is a mistake.	Kun dogoggora.
They shouldn’t know anything else.	Waan biraa beekuu hin qaban.
Of course, nothing happened.	Wanti ta’e akka hin jirre beekamaadha.
This career started very well.	Hojiin kun baayyee gaarii jalqabe.
Maybe it's just like this.	Tarii akkuma kana ta'uu danda'a.
She’s just a girl.	Isheen intala qofa.
So now they want another house.	Kanaaf amma mana biraa barbaadu.
Not just pictures, but all of it.	Suuraa qofa osoo hin taane, hunda isaa.
No one has their way with them.	Namni karaa isaa isaan waliin qabu hin jiru.
But I did it.	Ani garuu nan godhe.
Which we promised.	Kan waadaa galle.
It can be one of two things.	Wantoota lama keessaa tokko ta’uu danda’a.
I can't have that, not yet.	Sana qabaachuu hin danda'u, ammallee miti.
It can be very good for you.	Baayyee gaarii siif ta'uu danda'a.
To his hands.	Gara harka isaatti.
We should have been there.	Silaa achi jiraachuu qabna turre.
He is alone.	Inni kophaa isaa jira.
You don't have to tell him.	Itti himuu hin qabdu.
No one has any job there at all.	Namni tokkollee achitti hojii tokkollee hin qabu tasumaa.
Not many guys.	Gurbaa baay'ee hin jiru.
I just walked past the bar the other day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa mana dhugaatii sana bira darbe.
he says.	jedha.
I might have a picture of that.	Suuraa sanaa qabaachuu danda'a.
But that wasn’t the worst part.	Garuu sun waan hunda caalaa hamaa hin turre.
Maybe a lot of things happen.	Tarii wanti baay'een ni ta'a.
If it’s good, that’s it.	Yoo gaarii ta’e kanuma.
He was no longer there.	Kana booda achi hin turre.
You have to do something.	Waan tokko gochuu qabda.
That didn’t seem like a big deal.	Sun waan guddaa hin fakkaatu ture.
I can't do anything.	Ani homaa gochuu hin danda'u.
That's how it should be.	Akkasitti ta'uu qaba.
But I want more than that.	Ani garuu kana caalaa barbaada.
It’s not money.	Maallaqa miti.
He does that.	Akkas godha.
This wasn’t right.	Kun sirrii hin turre.
Do you think it will work?.	Ni hojjeta jettanii yaaddu?.
No one else liked working with her.	Namni biraa ishee waliin hojjechuu jaallatu hin turre.
But maybe it's good now.	Garuu tarii amma gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
It’s really nothing.	Dhuguma homaa miti.
He was so good to me.	Inni akkasitti naaf gaarii ture.
I couldn't be without him.	Isa malee ta'uu hin dandeenye.
I have no idea about that.	Waa'ee sanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu.
It was wrong to do so.	Akkas gochuun dogoggora ture.
I didn’t want her to go with me.	Akka isheen na waliin deemtu hin barbaanne.
He doesn’t have his chance.	Carraa isaa hin qabu.
I would always be alone.	Yeroo hundumaa kophaa koo taʼa ture.
You are an important person.	Ati nama barbaachisaa dha.
No luck today.	Har'a carraa hin qabu.
He was a good man.	Nama gaarii ture.
But she wasn't.	Isheen garuu hin turre.
But he still had plenty of time on his hands.	Garuu ammas yeroo baay'ee harka isaa irra ture.
I saw them today.	Har'a isaan arge.
You just need to get some help, she said.	Gargaarsa tokko tokko argachuu qofa si barbaachisa jette.
I didn’t know you could do that.	Akkas gochuu akka dandeessu hin beeku ture.
Many were not so lucky.	Baay'een isaanii akkas carraa hin qaban turan.
Without a hat.	Kophee malee.
This is not an idea.	Kun yaada miti.
Right now, that rarely happens.	Yeroo ammaa kana, sun yeroo muraasaaf taʼa.
It’s not just mine.	Kan koo qofa miti.
He should have known.	Silaa beekuu qaba ture.
A real dog.	Saree dhugaa.
It just wasn’t like that.	Akkas qofa hin turre.
You’re not even there.	Ati illee hin jirtu.
They were that bad.	Akkasitti hamaa turan.
What did you say.	Maali jette.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
It wasn’t a joke.	Qoosaa hin turre.
It’s deserted without us, but not for long.	Nu malee nama malee jira, garuu yeroo dheeraaf miti.
But no one was pleased with themselves.	Garuu namni ofitti gammade hin jiru.
Bad morning.	Ganama hamaa.
More than interested.	Fedhii qabaachuu caalaa.
You know them.	Ati isaan beekta.
Work, but simple.	Hojii, garuu salphaa.
Then it got bad again.	Sana booda ammas hamaa ta'e.
This is what happened.	Wanti ta'e kana.
They were in danger.	Balaa keessa turan.
Maybe another time.	Tarii yeroo biraa.
While this	Osoo kun .
He can help us.	Inni nu gargaaruu dandaʼa.
He was a good guy.	Inni nama gaarii ture.
All the things he loves about her.	Wantoota ishee irraa jaallatu hunda.
Book, book, book.	Kitaaba, kitaaba, kitaaba.
I mean, not any more.	Kana caalaa miti jechuu kooti.
No one seemed to have an answer.	Namni deebii qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
That’s all, nothing at all.	Kana qofa, tasumaa homaa miti.
That very rarely happens.	Sun baayyee yeroo muraasaaf ta'a.
I just think of her.	Ishee qofa yaada.
It should be very easy for you.	Baayyee salphaa siif ta'uu qaba.
It wasn't exactly.	Sirriitti hin turre.
A good house.	Mana gaarii.
The whole way.	Karaa guutuu.
I don't know anything more about that.	Waa'ee sanaa kana caalaa homaa hin beeku.
I didn’t, you know.	Ani hin goone, beekta.
You both have it.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu qabdu.
I can't speak.	Dubbachuu hin danda'u.
But none of them seem to work.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
The three-dimensional one.	Kan sadii ta'e.
He's just too cute to be real.	Inni dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee namatti tola qofa.
It was unforgivable.	Dhiifama kan hin qabne ture.
He does so many things for us.	Waan baay'ee nuuf hojjeta.
You know that better than I do.	Sana ana caalaa beekta.
I didn't see much of him.	Isa baay'ee hin argine.
He certainly didn’t.	Inni akka hin goone beekamaadha.
He got one and two.	Tokko fi lama argate.
He had a couple of children.	Ijoollee tokko lama qaba ture.
Maybe it never will.	Tarii gonkumaa hin ta'u ta'a.
It seemed everywhere and nowhere.	Bakka hundumaa fi bakka hin jirre fakkaata ture.
Then he saw a little girl.	Sana booda intala xiqqoo tokko arge.
I have been working.	Hojjechaa tureera.
But he couldn’t do that.	Garuu sana gochuu hin dandeenye.
You must forgive me.	Dhiifama naaf gochuu qabda.
But this was not all.	Garuu kun hundi hin turre.
It doesn’t make them any more special.	Caalaatti adda isaan hin godhu.
To be a scholar.	Beeka ta'uuf.
But I still have that kind of problem.	Garuu ammallee rakkoo akkasii qaba.
It is completely waiting for you.	Guutummaatti si eegaa jira.
You should never do this.	Gonkumaa kana gochuu hin qabdu.
We have their names.	Maqaa isaanii qabna.
I like our chances.	Carraa keenya natti tola.
That’s how she has time.	Akkasitti yeroo qabdi.
He did nothing more.	Kana caalaa homaa hin goone.
That it's just me.	Ana qofa ta'uu koo.
No one has it, but someone does.	Namni tokkollee hin qabu, garuu namni qaba.
Maybe one day.	Tarii guyyaa tokko.
So good at her job.	Kanaaf hojii ishee irratti gaarii dha.
She said she had it.	Akka qabdu jette.
I had a problem with someone like that.	Nama akkasii waliin rakkoon qaba ture.
But she was nothing of the sort.	Garuu isheen homaa akkasii hin turre.
Something seemed wrong with his eyes.	Ija isaa irratti wanti tokko waan dogoggora ta'e fakkaata ture.
I just need you.	Si qofa na barbaachisa.
I didn't know who it was.	Eenyu akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
You know it, you know.	Ati ni beekta.
The two are not the same.	Lamaan isaanii tokko miti.
You are both right.	Lamaan keessan iyyuu sirrii dha.
He wondered if that mattered.	Sun dhimma qabaa jedhee yaade.
You can’t do more than that.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeessu.
Maybe he still was.	Tarii ammallee ture ta'a.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Tarii akkas ta'uu danda'a.
But then, this wasn’t like that at all, really.	Garuu sana booda, kun tasumaa akkas hin turre, dhuguma.
But what if it happens.	Garuu maal yoo ta'e.
Probably not yet.	Tarii hanga ammaatti miti.
This is not very accurate.	Kun baayyee sirrii miti.
This is how it should be.	Kun akkas ta'uu qaba.
I love their food.	Nyaata isaanii baay'een jaalladha.
In bad times, as now, they still have.	Yeroo hamaa keessatti akkuma ammaa ammallee qabu.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Kana booda waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
I love all your work.	Hojii kee hunda nan jaalladha.
He has a life.	Jireenya qaba.
We are getting really really bad.	Dhuguma dhuguma hamaa ta'aa jirra.
You don’t want me here.	Asitti na hin barbaaddu.
He realized now that he was in grave danger.	Balaa hamaa keessa akka jiru amma hubate.
Something was definitely not right here.	Asitti wanti tokko sirrii akka hin turre beekamaadha.
Maybe it's already too late.	Tarii duruu yeroon booda ta'uu danda'a.
Now is a good time.	Amma yeroo gaarii dha.
I thought you really didn’t know he would.	Dhuguma akka inni godhu hin beektu jedheen yaade.
We can no longer help you.	Kana booda isin gargaaruu hin dandeenyu.
It’s not an easy thing.	Waan salphaa miti.
My night went there.	Halkan koo achi deeme.
I don't like him.	Ani isa hin jaalladhu.
It was two in the afternoon.	Waaree booda sa'aatii lama ture.
Some people are like that.	Namoonni tokko tokko akkas.
That’s how we are in the house.	Akkasitti mana keessa jirra.
I am none of these things.	Ani waan kana keessaa tokkollee miti.
That is obviously not true.	Sun dhugaa akka hin taane ifaadha.
Maybe a year.	Tarii waggaa tokko.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
But I don't understand.	Ani garuu naaf hin galle.
He had it.	Inni qaba ture.
But nothing happened.	Garuu wanti ta'e hin turre.
I don’t have a bar here.	Asitti mana dhugaatii hin qabu.
This is my feeling.	Kun miira kooti.
It's not time to go back.	Yeroon duubatti deebi'uu miti.
You must be kidding.	Qoosaa jirtu ta'uu qaba.
I will never be good enough.	Ani gonkumaa gaarii hin ta'u.
But if he does.	Garuu yoo godhe.
Both of them.	Lamaan isaanii iyyuu.
It’s all about emotion.	Hundi isaa miira.
He only wanted the best for you.	Inni waan gaarii qofa siif barbaada ture.
This seems a bit extreme.	Kun xiqqoo garmalee waan ta'e fakkaata.
None of those people knew it was me.	Namoota sana keessaa tokkollee ana ta'uu isaa hin beeku ture.
I think it's a bad idea.	Yaada hamaa natti fakkaata.
This was extremely dangerous, but she didn't need long.	Kun garmalee balaa qaba ture, garuu yeroo dheeraa ishee hin barbaachifne.
We must do our best.	Waan dandeenyu hunda gochuu qabna.
But you are different.	Ati garuu adda.
Now wait here.	Amma as eegaa.
His devotion to this was enormous.	Kanaaf of kennuu inni qabu baay’ee guddaa ture.
Like just now.	Akkuma amma qofa.
It doesn’t go any further.	Kana caalaa hin deemu.
She didn't speak very well of you at all.	Isheen tasumaa waa'ee kee baay'ee gaarii hin dubbanne.
I think he suspects me.	Na shakka jedheen yaada.
But he was in a bad situation.	Garuu haala hamaa keessa ture.
I know everything you mean.	Waan ati jechuu barbaaddu hunda nan beeka.
It had been good.	Gaarii ta'ee ture.
There is no such thing.	Wanti akkasii hin jiru.
It hasn’t always worked out that way for us.	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti nuuf hin hojjenne.
It took longer than one would think.	Yeroo namni tokko yaadu caalaa yeroo dheeraa fudhate.
We mean for that to happen.	Sana akka ta'uuf jechuu keenya.
That can be dangerous.	Sun balaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
It was very clear.	Baay'ee ifa ture.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
That is extremely important.	Sun garmalee barbaachisaa dha.
Some time passed.	Yeroon tokko tokko darbe.
We can’t stay here now.	Amma as turuu hin dandeenyu.
Their hope and clarity of thought.	Abdii fi ifa yaada isaanii.
Everything seems to be going well.	Wanti hundi akka gaariitti waan deemu fakkaata.
She really was like that.	Dhuguma isheen akkas turte.
We can’t just leave them alone.	Isaan qofa dhiisuu hin dandeenyu.
None of them did that.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee akkas hin goone.
He doesn't love me.	Inni na hin jaallatu.
That should probably happen.	Sun tarii ta'uu qaba.
You're not wrong about everything though.	Ati garuu waa'ee hunda dogoggora hin qabdu.
Let me just do it.	Mee akkan godhu qofa.
He had no one.	Nama hin qabu ture.
I even have no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e illee yaada hin qabu.
I just look like her.	Ani ishee qofa fakkaata.
There was nothing around here.	Naannoo asitti homaa hin turre.
Good night everyone.	Halkan gaarii hunda.
Her and everyone else.	Ishee fi nama hunda.
He found his voice.	Sagalee isaa argate.
But this time was different.	Yeroon kun garuu adda ture.
She was not a wife to him.	Isheen isaaf haadha manaa hin turre.
They are in one or two.	Tokko fi lama keessa jiru.
Another one of my favorites.	Kan biraa kan ani jaalladhu keessaa tokko.
But I don't have time.	Ani garuu yeroo hin qabu.
I couldn't go back to my wife.	Gara haadha manaa kootti deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
This was the day.	Kun guyyaa ture.
Another time, perhaps.	Yeroo biraa, tarii.
That seems obvious enough.	Sun waan ifa ta’e gahaa fakkaata.
That's how we are now.	Amma akkas jirra.
I wanted to ask a question.	Gaaffii tokko gaafachuu barbaade.
As good as it got at the time.	Akkuma yeroo sanatti argate gaarii.
But obviously not.	Garuu akka hin taane ifaadha.
Not much, but some.	Baay'ee osoo hin taane tokko tokko.
I can get this to work no problem.	Kana akka hojjetu gochuu nan danda'a rakkoo hin qabu.
He didn't have time.	Yeroo hin qabu ture.
They need it.	Isaan barbaachisa.
Everything was fine now.	Amma wanti hundi gaarii ture.
The existence of this thing.	Wanti kun jiraachuu.
They were lucky.	Carraa qaban turan.
Everything was just too much.	Wanti hundi garmalee qofa ture.
I hope it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
It was all wrong.	Hundi isaa dogoggora ture.
That doesn’t mean you should never quit.	Kana jechuun gonkumaa dhiisuu hin qabdu jechuu miti.
You have to come to Him.	Gara isaa dhufuu qabda.
Tell them you don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e akka hin beekne itti himi.
It definitely took its time.	Yeroo isaa akka fudhate beekamaadha.
I don’t need it anymore.	Kana booda na hin barbaachisu.
She was in it for a while.	Isheen yeroo muraasaaf keessa turte.
It must be first.	Dura ta'uu qaba.
You are not in desire.	Fedhii keessa hin jirtu.
You would be here again.	Ati ammas as jirta ture.
We all have it.	Hundi keenya qabna.
Just a few answers.	Deebii muraasa qofa.
That is what he did.	Kan godhe kanuma ture.
I am sure it will happen.	Akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa dha.
People are so interested.	Namoonni akkasitti fedhii qabu.
This is the only exception.	Kan kanaan ala jiru kana qofa.
Three no one came to.	Sadii namni itti dhufe hin jiru.
We wanted to find someone else.	Nama biraa argachuu barbaanne.
But this is up there.	Garuu kun achi ol jira.
I don’t like them.	Ani isaan hin jaalladhu.
Then onto her.	Sana booda ishee irratti.
But it never was.	Garuu gonkumaa hin turre.
He wants me to tell him.	Akkan itti himu barbaada.
But you’re not kidding me.	Garuu ati natti hin qoosaa jirtu.
Otherwise, everything else doesn’t matter.	Yoo kana hin taane wanti biraa hundi dhimma hin qabu.
There were three children.	Ijoollee sadii turan.
I have the same problem.	Anis rakkoo wal fakkaatu qaba.
You have to have some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko qabaachuu qabda.
Finding a new place.	Bakka haaraa argachuu.
A bad place.	Bakka hamaa.
I didn’t see anyone.	Nama tokkollee hin argine.
It would be right as always.	Silaa akkuma yeroo hundumaa sirrii ta'a.
She doesn't have you.	Isheen si hin qabdu.
But not much.	Garuu baay'ee miti.
He seemed to be in a bad mood.	Nama miira gaarii hin qabne fakkaata ture.
You all think very highly of me.	Hundi keessan baayyee ol naaf yaaddu.
We need more of the likes of you.	Kan akka keessan caalaa nu barbaachisa.
We don’t need them.	Isaan nu hin barbaachisu.
No problem, yet.	Rakkoon hin jiru, ammallee.
We don't have time.	Yeroo hin qabnu.
Not yet, he told himself.	Ammallee miti jedhee ofitti hime.
Sorry, just not like that.	Dhiifama, akkas miti qofa.
You can do whatever it takes at that point.	Yeroo sanatti waan barbaachisu hunda gochuu dandeessa.
That's what's happening now.	Amma ta'aa jiru kanuma.
She doesn’t seem to be amused.	Isheen waan qoosaa jirtu hin fakkaattu.
I couldn’t ask for more.	Kana caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
This may be a matter of time.	Kun dhimma yeroo ta’uu danda’a.
But he didn't do that.	Garuu akkas hin goone.
It has two parts.	Kutaa lama qaba.
He looked evil.	Inni hamaa fakkaata ture.
I just need a little time.	Yeroo xiqqoo qofa na barbaachisa.
About what happened.	Waa'ee waan ta'e.
Something may never happen.	Yoomiyyuu wanti tokko taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
It's a very good idea.	Yaada baayyee gaarii dha.
He thought that was pretty cool.	Sun baayyee namatti tola jedhee yaade.
It had been enough today.	Har'a gahaa ta'ee ture.
He seemed like a sure man.	Nama mirkanaa'aa fakkaata ture.
It was a good working day.	Guyyaa hojii gaarii ture.
Always new.	Yeroo hundumaa haaraa.
It was more important than that.	Kana caalaa barbaachisaa ture.
It just couldn't happen.	Ta'uu hin dandeenye qofa.
They have a lot of time.	Yeroo baay'ee qabu.
I think you're a good person.	Ati nama gaarii natti fakkaata.
But all this is still not enough.	Garuu kun hundi ammallee gahaa miti.
We are all good.	Hundi keenya gaarii dha.
I have been there for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf achi tureera.
I have.	Ani qaba.
He was the only one who could know.	Kan beekuu danda'u isa qofa ture.
You are not entirely wrong.	Guutummaatti dogoggora hin qabdu.
How can you do it.	Akkamitti dandeessa.
There was a problem.	Rakkoon ture.
I don’t think you ever will.	Yoomiyyuu waan gootu natti hin fakkaatu.
He seems to love children.	Ijoollee waan jaallatu fakkaata.
I have to go now.	Amma deemuun dirqama.
What happens next is unclear.	Booda maaltu ta'u ifa miti.
Maybe that's what happened now.	Tarii amma wanti akkasii ta'ee jira ta'a.
I hope one of you can help me.	Tokko keessan akka na gargaaru abdiin qaba.
But it wasn't going to happen here.	Garuu asitti ta'uuf hin turre.
This time it works.	Yeroo kana ni hojjeta.
It's not a return.	Deebi'uu miti.
But hope is in our hands.	Abdiin garuu harka keenya keessa jira.
But he doesn't seem happy.	Garuu waan gammade hin fakkaatu.
No one knows about it.	Namni waa'ee isaa beeku hin jiru.
I'm here to help.	Gargaaruuf as jira.
I don't mean anything.	Homaa jechuu koo miti.
Nothing really stood out.	Dhuguma wanti adda taʼe tokkollee hin turre.
But it is not like that at all.	Garuu tasumaa akkas miti.
So the timing was right.	Kanaaf yeroon sun sirrii ture.
Mostly things are good.	Irra caalaa wanti gaarii dha.
Very, very nice work.	Hojii baayyee baayyee namatti tola.
Everything that is needed.	Waan barbaachisu hunda.
Like, tomorrow, even.	Akka, boru, illee.
But it wasn’t then.	Garuu yeroo sana hin turre.
I don't know her very well.	Ani ishee baay'ee hin beeku.
But I didn’t see any of them.	Garuu isaan keessaa tokkollee hin argine.
It could still happen.	Ammas ta'uu danda'a.
You have a voice.	Sagalee qabda.
I'm with you.	Si waliin jira.
Why are you here.	Maaliif as jirta.
There isn’t.	Hin jiru.
That works well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti hojjeta.
Like he knew it would be.	Akkuma inni akka ta'u beeku.
They have no real friends.	Hiriyyoota dhugaa hin qaban.
We had to buy one of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko bitachuu qabna turre.
This was not true.	Kun dhugaa hin turre.
Which we all were.	Kan hundi keenya turre.
It’s not my business.	Dhimma koo miti.
It was still new.	Ammallee haaraa ture.
That’s all there is now.	Amma kan jiru kana qofa.
Everyone has a name.	Namni hundi maqaa qaba.
That was very likely.	Sun carraa guddaa qaba ture.
You can tell me.	Himuu dandeessu.
Maybe it's always on time.	Tarii yeroo hundumaa yeroon ta'uu danda'a.
They could not do much better.	Isaan kana caalaa baayʼee hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
There she said.	Achitti jette.
We are here to help each other.	Wal gargaaruuf as jirra.
She couldn’t have helped herself.	Silaa of gargaaruu hin dandeessu turte.
I should have done my homework.	Silaa hojii manaa koo hojjechuu qaba ture.
I didn't think I could survive another night in there.	Halkan biraa achi keessa jiraachuu danda'a jedhee hin yaadne.
You have to do your job.	Hojii kee hojjechuu qabda.
You did it.	Ati goote.
No one could see it.	Namni arguu hin dandeenye.
He may be right.	Inni sirrii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I have no idea what to do.	Waan godhu yaada hin qabu.
But not this morning.	Garuu ganama kana miti.
They were real, of course.	Isaan dhugaa akka turan beekamaadha.
I'm just your mother.	Ani haadha kee qofa.
They are all very good.	Hundi isaanii baayyee gaarii dha.
It’s all the same.	Hundi isaa tokko.
Everything goes away.	Wanti hundi ni deema.
You shouldn't get it.	Argachuu hin qabdu.
Not much though.	Baay'ee miti garuu.
Seeing something else.	Waan biraa arguu.
Not often but sometimes.	Yeroo baayyee osoo hin taane yeroo tokko tokko.
People like right and wrong.	Namoonni sirrii fi dogoggora ni jaallatu.
It's unclear who that person will be.	Namni sun eenyu akka ta'u ifa miti.
Better than last year.	Waggaa darbe caalaa gaarii dha.
If you are not one of us, you do not exist.	Yoo ati nu keessaa tokko hin taane hin jirtu.
But it would be wrong.	Garuu dogoggora ta'a.
It’s a really good idea.	Dhuguma yaada gaarii dha.
I could have known better.	Silaa kana caalaa beekuu danda'a ture.
Of course, this is not the only one.	Kun qofa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He wanted it for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf barbaada ture.
But it’s not that simple.	Garuu akkas salphaa miti.
A few things.	Waan muraasa.
We have it and it does.	Qabna ni godha.
You are right to go now.	Amma deemuun keessan sirrii dha.
Some people love them.	Namoonni tokko tokko isaan ni jaallatu.
Never a long time.	Gonkumaa yeroo dheeraa miti.
I think that is very wrong.	Sun baayyee dogoggora natti fakkaata.
Which she can be.	Kan isheen ta'uu dandeessu.
This was someone else.	Kun nama biraa ture.
He said that tonight was the night.	Halkan kana halkan akka ta'e dubbate.
He still wanted it.	Ammas barbaada ture.
I know it's too much.	Garmalee akka ta'e nan beeka.
I never have, never have.	Ani gonkumaa hin qabu, gonkumaa hin qabu.
So it passed.	Kanaaf darbe.
He didn't speak.	Hin dubbanne.
We have many of them.	Isaan keessaa hedduu qabna.
You are always here to help us.	Yeroo hundumaa nu gargaaruuf as jirtu.
You don't do this very often.	Yeroo baay'ee kana hin gootu.
I have no idea why.	Maaliif akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
Not much of it was better than mine.	Baay'een isaa kan koo caalaa hin turre.
I love it so much.	Baay'een jaalladha.
He has a great idea.	Yaada guddaa qaba.
I didn't understand this either.	Anis kana hin hubanne.
It’s not for us.	Nuuf miti.
He wasn’t there.	Inni hin turre.
He got two.	Lama argate.
You are not truly unique, even.	Ati adda taate dhugaa miti, illee.
I think it's very unlikely.	Ani baay'ee akka hin taane natti fakkaata.
That may be the case.	Akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
We had nothing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti homaa hin qabnu turre.
They were evil.	Isaan hamaa turan.
Nothing more was needed.	Kana caalaa wanti barbaachisu hin turre.
Sorry .	Dhiifama .
It would have been much easier that way.	Silaa akkasitti baayyee salphaa ture.
An important night.	Halkan barbaachisaa ta'e.
I’m still interested though.	Ammallee fedhii qaba garuu.
Neither had children.	Lamaan isaanii ijoollee hin qaban turan.
I certainly don’t want to.	Akkan hin barbaanne beekamaadha.
You can't speak.	Dubbachuu hin dandeessu.
He would have known what to do.	Silaa waan godhu beeka ture.
I wanted to be in there so badly.	Ani akka malee hamaa ta'ee achi keessa ta'uu barbaade.
He will be with us soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti nu waliin ta'a.
This didn't look like her.	Kun ishee hin fakkaattu ture.
I don't really like that.	Ani akkas baay'ee hin jaalladhu.
In that case this does not exist.	Haala sana keessatti kun hin jiru.
He would have loved them.	Silaa isaan jaallata ture.
She was a dog.	Isheen saree turte.
I'm very happy with it.	Ani baayyee itti gammadeera.
I think that works very well.	Sun baayyee gaarii ta'ee hojjeta jedheen yaada.
They were just friends.	Hiriyyoota qofa turan.
None of this mattered.	Kun tokkollee dhimma hin qabu ture.
There are only three of them.	Isaan kun sadii qofa.
But that’s always wrong.	Garuu sun yeroo hundumaa dogoggora.
I have to live with that.	Sana waliin jiraachuu qaba.
Is this just a mistake.	Kun dogoggora qofa moo.
That she used to be.	Duraan akka turte.
Nothing seems clearer.	Wanti kana caalaa ifa ta'e hin fakkaatu.
That’s not what he meant.	Kana jechuu isaa miti.
I didn’t see him with anyone though.	Ani garuu nama tokko waliin isa hin argine.
He had a couple of ideas.	Yaada tokko lama qaba ture.
Who was right and who was wrong is irrelevant.	Eenyu sirrii ture eenyutu dogoggora ture barbaachisaa miti.
I have a problem though.	Rakkoon qaba garuu.
Not entirely sure on that.	Sana irratti guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa miti.
I didn’t think of any of that.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin yaadne.
I love you, my boy.	Si jaalladha gurbaa koo.
So you have to go back.	Kanaaf duubatti deebi'uu qabda.
It was for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ture.
That’s not always the case.	Yeroo hunda akkas miti.
Not much, he thought.	Baay'ee miti jedhee yaade.
I'm looking for it.	Ani barbaada.
He was there many times.	Yeroo baay'ee achi ture.
There is nothing inside me.	Keessa kootti homaa hin jiru.
Her parents real name.	Maqaa dhugaa warra ishee.
He looked like .	Inni fakkaata ture .
But there were a lot of problems.	Garuu rakkoon baay'ee ture.
You shouldn't talk like that.	Akkasitti dubbachuu hin qabdu.
Then there is time.	Sana booda yeroon jira.
But of course that’s not true at all.	Garuu beekamaadha sun tasumaa dhugaa miti.
But you have to do this for me.	Garuu waan kana naaf gochuu qabda.
They have something she doesn’t have.	Waan isheen hin qabne qabu.
He must find her.	Ishee argachuu qaba.
It doesn’t need to be obvious.	Ifa ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
I'm not that good at that sort of thing.	Ani waan akkasii irratti hangas ga'umsa hin qabu.
You can, you know.	Ni dandeessa, beekta.
He was never real.	Inni gonkumaa dhugaa hin turre.
It doesn't have to be.	Dirqama ta'uu hin qabu.
It’s not something like that.	Waan akkasii miti.
This was his time.	Yeroon kun yeroo isaa ture.
I don't understand the reason for this.	Sababni kanaa naaf hin galle.
Needless to say it was.	Akka ture jechuun hin barbaachisu.
In my case that was a big problem.	Dhimma koo irratti sun rakkoo guddaa ture.
They have plenty of room for us.	Bakka baay'ee nuuf qabu.
Now you've said it.	Amma jettee jirta.
But that's how it happens.	Garuu akkas ta'a.
It was an easy task after this.	Kana booda hojii salphaa ture.
She had none of it.	Isheen tokkollee hin qabdu turte.
He lives here.	Inni as jiraata.
It’s not always there.	Yeroo hundumaa achi hin jiru.
He asked if anyone wanted to go back.	Namni duubatti deebi'uu barbaadu jiraa jedhee gaafate.
You should never do that.	Tasumaa akkas gochuu hin qabdu.
They want to see my work.	Hojii koo arguu barbaadu.
They were alone in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa kophaa isaanii turan.
I don't think so.	Ani natti hin fakkaatu.
It was an obvious question.	Gaaffii ifa ta'e ture.
They were too dangerous.	Garmalee balaa qaban turan.
This usually works well.	Kun yeroo baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
You can find it, you can find something.	Argachuu dandeessa, waan tokko argachuu dandeessa.
We have many problems.	Rakkoo hedduu qabna.
It must be unique.	Adda ta'uu qaba.
It’s better than it was.	Kan ture caalaa gaarii dha.
Jokes about .	Qoosaa waa'ee .
Only it wasn’t really our room anymore.	Qofa kana booda dhuguma kutaa keenya hin turre.
This is not enough.	Kun gahaa miti.
That someone here desperately needs help.	Namni as jiru tokko gargaarsa akka malee akka barbaadu.
I'm going to my room.	Gara kutaa kootti deemaa jira.
He was a nice guy.	Inni namatti tola ture.
But I saw none of this.	Garuu kana keessaa homaa hin argine.
It had to be you.	Si ta'uu qaba ture.
I think this is a big mistake.	Kun dogoggora guddaa natti fakkaata.
They have to help me.	Na gargaaruu qabu.
From the old man.	Nama durii irraa.
But he wanted more.	Garuu kana caalaa barbaade.
We’re both still there.	Lamaan keenyayyuu ammallee jirra.
But this year she was good.	Bara kana garuu gaarii turte.
But he is in trouble.	Garuu rakkoo keessa jira.
But she is a mother.	Garuu isheen haadha.
They are still together.	Ammas waliin jiru.
I was very excited.	Baay'een gammade.
Exactly here, there where.	Sirriitti asitti, achitti eessa.
I'll be fine.	Ani gaarii ta'a.
I don’t understand how you don’t understand that.	Akkamitti akka ati sana hin hubanne naaf hin galle.
I probably would have done it.	Ani tarii nan godha ture.
Good job on this one!.	Isa kana irratti hojii gaarii!.
He’s teaching me those things.	Wantoota sana na barsiisaa jira.
Of course, no one has any idea.	Namni yaada tokkollee akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
He didn't do it now.	Amma hin goone.
Maybe it didn't happen.	Tarii hin taane ta'a.
That was too late.	Yeroon sun baay'ee booda ture.
And they would do it again.	Ammas ni godhu turan.
Theirs, not mine.	Kan isaanii malee kan koo miti.
That’s when it hit me.	Yeroo sanatti natti dhufe.
Maybe you have something similar.	Tarii waan wal fakkaatu qabda ta'a.
I have no idea what it is.	Maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu.
It’s a job.	Hojii dha.
That's what happens around here.	Naannoo asitti kan ta'u kanuma.
But you can’t have everything.	Garuu waan hunda qabaachuu hin dandeessu.
Not always a good reason.	Yeroo hundumaa sababa gaarii miti.
You don't know.	Hin beektu.
They were rarely interested.	Fedhii qaban yeroo muraasa turan.
But it’s not a big deal.	Garuu waan guddaa miti.
A lot of people.	Namoota baay'ee.
Perhaps he was older than he looked.	Tarii inni fakkaatu caalaa umuriin isaa guddaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
They can all be good.	Hundi isaanii gaarii ta’uu danda’a.
He even says so himself.	Ofii illee akkas jedha.
This is a must.	Kun dirqama.
I mean really, really easy.	Dhuguma, dhuguma salphaa jechuu kooti.
You don't care.	Isin dhimma hin qabdu.
He went everywhere.	Bakka hunda deeme.
But it never mattered what she said.	Garuu waan isheen jette gonkumaa dhimma hin qabu ture.
I mean, from myself.	Ofii koo irraa jechuu kooti.
I wanted to make mine.	Kan koo gochuu barbaade.
I don’t understand how he knows this.	Kana akkamitti akka beeku hin galle.
We don't have time.	Yeroo hin qabnu.
It’s not just desire.	Fedhii qofa miti.
He was in great shape.	Haala guddaa keessa ture.
It was very different then.	Yeroo sanatti baayyee adda ture.
From the	Kan jedhu irraa .
I didn’t love her.	Ani ishee hin jaalladhu ture.
. . . .	.
You can get help.	Gargaarsa argachuu dandeessa.
One is all we need.	Tokko waan nu barbaachisu qofa.
Just last month around.	Ji'a darbe qofa naannoo.
But without him.	Garuu isa malee.
I haven’t seen you here before.	Kanaan dura asitti si hin argine.
He saw something in me.	Waan tokko na keessatti arge.
But he made a mistake.	Garuu dogoggora hojjete.
Which was real, she did.	Kan dhugaa ture, jettee goote.
Which, might be a good idea.	Kan, yaada gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
That took a great deal of time.	Sun yeroo guddaa fudhate.
I know you want to help.	Gargaaruu akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
You know about what's different and your thinking.	Waa'ee maaltu adda akka ta'ee fi yaada kee beekta.
He is not just one person.	Inni nama tokko qofa osoo hin taane.
It's big and spacious.	Guddaa fi bal'aa dha.
It looks like a good one.	Kan gaarii fakkaata.
I can do better than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu nan danda'a.
He is not such a thing.	Inni waan akkasii miti.
He works alone.	Kophaa isaa hojjeta.
They knew he was out there.	Akka inni ala jiru beeku turan.
A lot of things are good.	Wanti baay'een gaarii dha.
I wouldn't have thought that about him.	Silaa waa'ee isaa akkas hin yaadu ture.
We were alone, no one around.	Kophaa turre, namni naannoo sana jiru hin turre.
It doesn't matter why.	Maaliif akka ta'e homaa hin qabu.
He may come back later.	Booda deebi'uu danda'a.
It’s wrong.	Dogoggora qaba.
I was no longer alone.	Kana booda kophaa koo hin turre.
As if it were	Akka waan .
It didn't always have to be me.	Yeroo hunda ana ta'uu hin qabu ture.
It was just him.	Isa qofa ture.
No one knows but you.	Si malee namni beeku hin jiru.
I wanted to know all about it.	Waa'ee isaa hunda beekuu barbaade.
But you don't know that.	Ati garuu sana hin beektu.
I certainly have mine.	Kan koo akka qabu beekamaadha.
None of us were there.	Tokkollee keenya hin turre.
He wasn’t there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti achi hin turre.
I wanted to be better than you.	Si caalaa ta'uu barbaade.
I like some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko nan jaalladha.
Two becomes one.	Lama tokko ta'a.
Today, he's right.	Har'a, inni sirrii dha.
Then you have everything you need here.	Sana booda waan si barbaachisu hunda asitti qabda.
I am teaching.	Ani barsiisaa jira.
I wasn’t myself.	Ani ofii koo hin turre.
Now she would never have one.	Amma gonkumaa tokko hin qabdu turte.
Check it out in its entirety.	Guutummaatti ilaalaa.
Who he was.	Eenyu akka ture.
Which is not the case.	Kan hin taane.
Maybe not soon enough for me.	Tarii dafee naaf gahaa miti.
They have to do it now.	Amma gochuu qabu.
I am absolutely sure about it.	Waa'ee isaa guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa dha.
He can help you.	Inni si gargaaruu dandaʼa.
All day, nothing happened.	Guyyaa guutuu, wanti ta'e hin jiru.
My other answer is see how you do that.	Deebii koo inni biraa akkamitti akka sana gootu ilaalaa.
It has to come from her.	Ishee irraa dhufuu qaba.
What works, works.	Waan hojjetu, hojjeta.
Thus he was not so endearing.	Akkasitti akkas nama jaallatu hin turre.
He has a good job.	Hojii gaarii qaba.
But wait, that’s not really the case.	Garuu eegaa, dhuguma akkas miti.
But it doesn’t work.	Garuu hin hojjetu.
That’s one of the problems with the question he has.	Gaaffii inni qabu keessaa rakkoo tokko kanuma.
Just saying bad things.	Hamaa dubbachuu qofa.
There was something in this whole situation.	Haala kana hunda keessatti wanti tokko tokko ture.
Except for mistakes, for nothing.	Dogoggora malee, homaa malee.
Exactly the same place.	Bakka sirriitti wal fakkaatu.
It seems like a good life.	Jireenya gaarii fakkaata.
We need to be curious.	Fedhii beekuu qabna.
I hope we do.	Akka goonu abdiin qaba.
It wasn’t good at all.	Tasumaa gaarii hin turre.
Here, there was none.	Asitti, tokkollee hin turre.
That shouldn't be the case.	Sun ta'uu hin qabu.
Really with you.	Dhuguma si waliin.
I had no reason to do the right thing at the time.	Yeroo sanatti waan sirrii hojjechuuf sababa hin qabu ture.
That’s not just a theory.	Sun yaada qofa miti.
Other than that, just fine.	Kanaan ala, gaarii qofa.
She doesn’t seem to be with any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waliin waan jirtu hin fakkaattu.
You can help.	Gargaaruu dandeessa.
It won't happen again.	Ammas hin ta'u.
She will never think of him.	Isheen yoomiyyuu isa hin yaaddu.
He would indeed.	Dhuguma ni godha ture.
She doesn’t have her arm around him.	Isheen harka ishee isa hin qabdu.
But only daylight.	Garuu ifa guyyaa qofa.
They all do the job.	Hundi isaanii hojii sana hojjetu.
That reason is incorrect.	Sababni sun sirrii miti.
She was at home.	Isheen mana turte.
I really really enjoyed that.	Dhuguma dhuguma sanatti gammadeera.
This is somewhat accurate.	Kun hanga tokko sirrii dha.
That’s just not me.	Sun ana miti qofa.
That was a different time.	Yeroon sun yeroo adda taʼe ture.
You already have a problem.	Duraan rakkoo qabda.
I can never forgive you for this.	Kanaaf gonkumaa dhiifama siif gochuu hin danda'u.
You’re a nice guy.	Ati namatti tola.
There is no time anymore.	Yeroon kana booda hin jiru.
It was a terrible thing.	Waan hamaa ture.
I would do everything he did.	Waan inni godhe hunda nan godha ture.
I go with him, father.	Isa waliin deema abbaa.
This has never been a problem for us.	Kun rakkoo nuuf ta'ee hin beeku.
Not everyone likes everything all the time.	Namni hundi yeroo hunda waan hunda hin jaallatu.
As always, no one was there.	Akkuma yeroo hundumaa namni achi hin turre.
I'm looking into it.	Ani keessa ilaalaa jira.
He had come here to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechuuf as dhufe ture.
Just something, rarely.	Waan tokko qofa, yeroo muraasa.
I saw a different picture.	Ani garuu suuraa adda ta'e arge.
But, it didn’t work.	Garuu, hin hojjenne.
I can see that in him.	Sana isa keessatti arguu nan danda'a.
It's probably too late now.	Amma yeroon isaa darbe ta'uu hin oolu.
That was all I loved about it.	Wanti natti jaalladhu kana qofa ture.
I know what's going to happen.	Waan ta'u nan beeka.
As always alone.	Akkuma yeroo hundumaa kophaa isaa.
You need my car I need it.	Konkolaataa koo si barbaachisa na barbaachisa.
Maybe we both were.	Tarii lamaan keenyayyuu akkas turre ta'a.
It was his feelings.	Miira isaa ture.
But it went bad again.	Garuu ammas hamaa deeme.
He is not our man.	Inni nama keenya miti.
I hope it works out well.	Akka gaariitti akka hojjetu abdiin qaba.
Some little thing.	Wanti xiqqoo tokko tokko.
I mean, yours.	Kan kee jechuu kooti.
You knew that.	Ati kana beekta turte.
None of this might have happened.	Kun tokkollee taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa ture.
I have a lot of people I know.	Namoota beeku baay'ee qaba.
She had to fill them.	Isaan guutuu qabdi turte.
You don’t know what it’s like here.	Asitti maal akka fakkaatu hin beektu.
This wasn’t acting.	Kun taphachuu hin turre.
You have to do it right.	Sirrii gochuu qabda.
But it still doesn't work.	Garuu ammas hin hojjetu.
Who knows why not.	Maaliif akka hin taane eenyutu beeka.
None of those feelings had a name.	Miira sana keessaa tokkollee maqaa hin qabu ture.
I couldn't see him.	Isa arguu hin dandeenye.
He knew what he had to do on this day.	Guyyaa kana maal gochuu akka qabu ni beeka ture.
It was not unreasonable to do so.	Kana gochuun sababa hin qabne hin turre.
The problem is me.	Rakkoon jiru ana.
I think that would work.	Sun ni hojjeta jedheen yaada.
They weren’t with me.	Isaan na waliin hin turre.
No one noticed before.	Kanaan dura namni hubate hin jiru.
I had no time to say anything.	Yeroon homaa jedhu hin qabu ture.
The most important part.	Kutaa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
No one seems to know what that might be.	Sun maal ta’uu akka danda’u namni beeku hin jiru fakkaata.
I think he can do it.	Inni gochuu danda'a jedheen yaada.
I didn't see you.	Si hin argine.
It is not a necessary condition.	Haala barbaachisaa miti.
I want her here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana as ishee barbaada.
Clearly, he did.	Akka godhe ifaadha.
We are very.	Nuti baayyee...
There’s nothing we can do about that.	Sana irratti wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu hin jiru.
That's all.	Waan kana qofa.
Let's see if that's the case	Mee sun haala .
He looked dangerous.	Inni balaa fakkaata ture.
Then he would have always had her.	Sana booda silaa yeroo hundumaa ishee qaba ture.
It 's not easy	Salphaa mitii .
But he didn't.	Inni garuu hin goone.
He went out of his way with strangers.	Namoota hin beekne waliin karaa isaa ba'e.
It does nothing but nothing.	Waan tokko malee homaa hin godhu.
But he seemed very happy.	Garuu baayyee waan gammade fakkaata ture.
This is what we all hope for.	Kun hundi keenya abdii qabna.
Not everyone has that opportunity.	Carraa sana namni hundi hin qabu.
I wouldn't have done it otherwise.	Osoo akkas ta'ee hin godhu ture.
It would have been	Silaa .
What happened?' 	Waan ta'e?'
I think he bought that.	Sana waan bite natti fakkaata.
It wasn’t like that at all.	Tasumaa akkas hin taane.
It's just the truth.	Dhugaa ta'e qofa.
He should have done that a long time ago.	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura akkas gochuu qaba ture.
She was alone in her very large house.	Mana ishee baayyee guddaa keessa kophaa ishee turte.
She is the lucky few.	Isheen warra carraa qaban muraasa.
But they were doing everything right.	Garuu waan hunda sirriitti hojjechaa turan.
Maybe a little bit.	Tarii xiqqoo.
We have to give up a lot.	Waan baay'ee dhiisuu qabna.
This worked a little bit better.	Kun xiqqoo xiqqoo akka gaariitti hojjete.
This was an important thing.	Kun waan barbaachisaa ture.
We are here right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana as jirra.
I might ask her questions later.	Booda gaaffii ishee gaafachuu danda'a.
They’re just there to help themselves.	Of gargaaruuf qofa achi jiru.
Everything else looked fine.	Wanti biraa hundi gaarii fakkaata ture.
At the time, though, it seemed fine.	Yeroo sanatti garuu gaarii fakkaata ture.
So it exists now.	Kanaaf amma jira.
But there will be one.	Garuu tokko ni jiraata.
I have no issue with this.	Kana irratti dhimma tokkollee hin qabu.
He wasn’t doing so great.	Inni akkas guddaa hojjechaa hin turre.
Like, a lot of names.	Akka, maqaa baay'ee.
I could eat all day, every day.	Guyyaa guutuu, guyyaa hunda nyaachuu nan danda'a ture.
He never got a chance though.	Carraa argate hin beeku garuu.
I was a little too excited.	Xiqqoo garmalee gammadeera.
We couldn’t do it alone.	Kophaa keenya gochuu hin dandeenye.
One chance, just one chance.	Carraa tokko, carraa tokko qofa.
He wants her that way.	Inni akkasitti ishee barbaada.
It’s not like it used to be.	Akka durii miti.
Maybe it's a mistake.	Tarii dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
That we can still be together.	Ammas waliin ta'uu akka dandeenyu.
The reason for this remains unclear.	Sababni kanaa hanga ammaatti ifa hin taane.
Not perfect, really.	Guutuu miti, dhuguma.
Is there anyone who can help me.	Namni na gargaaru jiraa.
I didn’t want any trouble.	Rakkoo tokkollee hin barbaanne.
That was nothing.	Sun homaa hin turre.
My little thing? 	Wanti koo xiqqoo?
he asked the scientist.	jedhee gaafate.
He came to help.	Gargaaruuf dhufe.
It was always there for you.	Yeroo hundumaa siif ture.
I can't help him, any more than you can.	Ani isa gargaaruu hin danda'u, akka ati dandeessu caalaa.
It would have been great.	Silaa baayyee gaarii ture.
So he told himself.	Kanaaf ofitti hime.
You just can’t do that anymore.	Kana booda akkas gochuu qofa hin dandeessu.
He was the only person in the room.	Kutaa sana keessatti nama qofa ture.
But one must oblige.	Garuu namni tokko dirqama qabaachuu qaba.
But it’s not exactly funny.	Garuu sirriitti qoosaa miti.
If you are a human being.	Yoo nama taate.
She should know.	Beekuu qabdi.
She didn’t quite know what to do.	Maal akka gootu sirriitti hin beektu turte.
I want to do this for him.	Kana isaaf gochuun barbaada.
I have no idea about that at all.	Waa'ee sanaa tasumaa yaada hin qabu.
They are going to do something.	Waan tokko gochuuf jiru.
Maybe he really loves me.	Tarii dhuguma na jaallata ta'a.
Now she was different.	Amma adda turte.
I'm glad he is.	Inni ta'uu isaatti gammadeera.
He was right about that.	Sana irratti sirrii ture.
I think that’s wrong.	Sun dogoggora jedheen yaada.
I can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
But there is no such thing.	Garuu wanti akkasii hin jiru.
Long luck there.	Carraa dheeraa achitti.
He couldn’t make a mistake.	Dogoggora hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
He wasn’t with them.	Isaan waliin hin turre.
She said that many times.	Yeroo baay'ee akkas jette.
Can't see who's in it.	Eenyu akka keessa jiru arguu hin danda'u.
But he would do nothing.	Garuu homaa hin godhu ture.
It’s a joke, not a joke.	Qoosaa malee qoosaa miti.
You have to do what works for you.	Waan siif hojjetu hojjechuu qabda.
Maybe they still do.	Tarii ammallee ni godhu ta'a.
But maybe it's out there.	Garuu tarii achi ala ta'a.
But he hadn't told anyone why.	Garuu maaliif akka ta'e namatti hin himne ture.
That is what they would have done.	Silaa kanuma godhu turan.
But I couldn’t find any.	Garuu tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
So they have a way longer than us.	Kanaaf karaa keenya caalaa dheeraa qabu.
It’s not the real one.	Kan dhugaa miti.
No one there knows me.	Namni achitti na beeku hin jiru.
We’re going to do something tomorrow.	Boru waan tokko gochuuf jirra.
You are not an easy person.	Ati nama salphaa miti.
That would be a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ta'a.
Not really sure.	Dhuguma mirkanaa'aa miti.
I still couldn’t believe it.	Ammallee amanuu hin dandeenye.
Often, that is not enough.	Yeroo baayʼee, sun gahaa miti.
But she didn't want me.	Isheen garuu na hin barbaanne.
Wait for the right person.	Nama sirrii eegaa.
That is certainly not the case.	Sun akka hin taane beekamaadha.
he asked around.	jedhee naannoo isaa gaafate.
I don't think he did anything different.	Waan adda ta'e hojjete jedhee hin yaadu.
Look at this like this.	Mee kana akkasitti ilaalaa.
She was a mother.	Haadha ture.
He looked at me.	Na ilaale.
Perhaps that is true.	Tarii sun dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
He just wasn't very good at it.	Inni garuu baayyee ga'umsa hin qabu ture.
We have a pretty good idea of ​​where he is.	Bakka inni jiru yaada baayyee gaarii qabna.
You can be fine with all that.	Sana hundumaa wajjin gaarii taʼuu dandeessa.
Now you're there.	Amma achi jirta.
But we don't have to be right.	Garuu sirrii ta'uu hin qabnu.
It was three in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii sadii ture.
I love how it works here.	Asitti akkamitti akka hojjetu baay'een jaalladha.
But this seemed like something we could do.	Garuu kun waan gochuu dandeenyu fakkaata ture.
Please, just look at me.	Maaloo, ana qofa ilaalaa.
I don’t need you in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti si hin barbaachisu.
I won’t go to school with you.	Si waliin mana barumsaa hin deemu.
That wasn’t always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre.
But nothing happens.	Wanti ta'u garuu hin jiru.
I think that's the right thing to do.	Wanti sirrii ta'e sun natti fakkaata.
But that couldn’t last much longer.	Garuu sun kana caalaa yeroo dheeraa turuu hin dandeenye.
I'm new too.	Anis haaraa dha.
That person was already gone.	Namni sun duruu hin jiru ture.
It does, but it was a great year.	Ni ta'a, garuu bara guddaa ture.
She was always positive.	Yeroo hundumaa yaada gaarii qabdi turte.
He had probably had enough of her.	Inni tarii ishee gahaa ta'ee ture.
But they didn’t do it alone.	Garuu kophaa isaanii hin hojjenne.
He could have been here.	As jiraachuu danda'a ture.
Probably the worst of the season.	Tarii kan bara kanaa isa hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
It even had my name on it.	Maqaa koo illee irra ture.
So we don’t have all the answers.	Kanaaf deebii hunda hin qabnu.
I can't tell you any more now.	Kana caalaa amma sitti himuu hin danda'u.
What more could you ask for in a job.	Hojii tokko keessatti kana caalaa maal gaafachuu dandeessa.
He is at home now.	Amma mana jira.
But it hadn’t worked.	Garuu hin hojjenne ture.
I can play with it.	Itti taphachuu nan danda'a.
But then it never is.	Garuu sana booda gonkumaa hin jiru.
He shouldn’t be here.	Inni as jiraachuu hin qabu.
We were at home.	Mana turre.
They know who you are.	Eenyu akka taate ni beeku.
I thought he would.	Ni godha jedheen yaade.
But it’s just me.	Garuu ana qofa.
That it came from somewhere else.	Bakka biraa irraa akka dhufe.
I don’t know how to do this.	Akkamitti akka kana godhu hin beeku.
He has to buy himself what he has to do.	Waan gochuu qabu ofii isaa bitachuu qaba.
Not me, never meant me.	Ana miti, gonkumaa ana jechuu barbaade.
I can't eat much right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana baay'ee nyaachuu hin danda'u.
But this has little reason.	Garuu kun sababa xiqqoo qaba.
There is no need to go together.	Waliin deemuun hin barbaachisu.
It could be a couple of hours.	Sa'aatii lama lama ta'uu danda'a.
But maybe they shouldn't have been.	Garuu tarii akkas ta'uu hin qaban turan ta'a.
I didn’t know her well.	Ani sirriitti ishee hin beeku ture.
It could be this week.	Torban kana ta'uu danda'a.
It was just a joke.	Qoosaa qofa ture.
He knew all this well.	Kana hunda sirriitti beeka ture.
Someone knows something.	Namni tokko waan tokko beeka.
You never know who you could have been.	Silaa eenyu ta'uu akka dandeessu gonkumaa hin beektu.
I’m in this for the long haul.	Ani yeroo dheeraaf kana keessa jira.
Nobody likes that.	Namni akkas jaallatu hin jiru.
She is my everything.	Isheen waan hundumaa kooti.
Anyone have any suggestions?.	Namni yaada qabu jiraa?.
He works on his jokes.	Qoosaa isaa irratti hojjeta.
He was very still instructive.	Inni baay'ee ammas barsiisaa ture.
The car that used to be there.	Konkolaataa duraan ture sana.
Eating alone tonight.	Halkan kana kophaa nyaachuu.
Perhaps it was a genuine mistake.	Tarii dogoggora dhugaa taʼuu dandaʼa.
He had no one else.	Nama biraa hin qabu ture.
I always know where he is.	Yeroo hundumaa eessa akka jiru nan beeka.
But there is a problem.	Garuu rakkoon jira.
This problem is more than what happened.	Rakkoon kun ta'e caalaa.
Think about it	Mee yaadu .
I don't know, but maybe you do.	Hin beeku garuu tarii beekta ta'a.
Very nice guy.	Gurbaa baayyee namatti tola.
This was definitely not how it was supposed to be.	Kun akkas ta'uu qabu akka hin turre beekamaadha.
That should do it, he thought.	Sun gochuu qaba jedhee yaade.
What they have that they don’t have.	Maal qaban kan hin qabne.
Often this happens twice.	Yeroo baayyee kun yeroo lama ta’a.
It’s just really perfect.	Dhuguma guutuu qofa.
We were all doing the same job.	Hundi keenya hojii tokko hojjechaa turre.
He looked like their father.	Abbaa isaanii fakkaata ture.
I want you as my wife.	Akka haadha manaa kootti si barbaada.
You need more than that.	Kana caalaa si barbaachisa.
She had a new job.	Hojii haaraa qabdi turte.
You shouldn't have talked to me about it.	Silaa waa'ee isaa natti dubbachuu hin qabdu turte.
It was really special.	Dhuguma adda ture.
From where he is, he can see everything.	Bakka jiru irraa waan hundumaa arguu danda’a.
He became a father too late.	Abbaa ta'e yeroon booda ture.
There couldn’t be anything else.	Wanti biraa jiraachuu hin danda’u ture.
It was as she knew it.	Akkuma isheen beektu ture.
It was never a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ta'ee hin beeku.
He was waiting.	Inni eegaa ture.
We were the ones.	Nuti turre.
He could no longer do it on his own.	Kana booda ofuma isaatiin hojjechuu hin dandeenye.
By that, we mean no one makes money for it.	Kana jechuun namni maallaqa itti godhu hin jiru jechuu keenya.
But he had to work on it.	Garuu irratti hojjechuu qaba ture.
This is possible, but not easy to do.	Kun ni danda’ama, garuu gochuun salphaa miti.
Things are never right.	Wanti gonkumaa sirrii miti.
This isn’t an interview.	Kun gaaffii fi deebii hin ta’u.
You don’t have time, you have life.	Yeroo hin qabdu jireenya qabda.
I want the real thing.	Waan dhugaa nan barbaada.
It looked completely different.	Guutummaatti adda fakkaata ture.
I know that this is a very similar life.	Kun jireenya baayʼee akka wal fakkaatu nan beeka.
In our case this is not necessary.	Haala keenya keessatti kun hin barbaachisu.
No one is above you.	Namni si ol hin jiru.
There wasn't much time at all.	Yeroon baay'ee hin turre tasumaa.
not.	miti.
But they are nothing.	Garuu isaan homaa miti.
You have it	Ni qabduu .
As we inevitably do.	Akkuma nuti gochuun keenya waan hin oolle.
I didn’t mean that.	Ani akkas jechuu hin barbaanne.
So not much.	Kanaaf baay'ee miti.
They have to work alone.	Kophaa isaanii hojjechuu qabu.
That’s when it hit me.	Yeroo sanatti natti dhufe.
I don’t even have a good picture.	Suuraa gaarii illee hin qabu.
We should have played them more often.	Silaa yeroo baay'ee isaan taphachuu qabna turre.
It will eat you up.	Si nyaata.
When he spoke.	Yeroo inni dubbate.
But no one wanted to live in them.	Garuu namni isaan keessa jiraachuu barbaadu hin turre.
It might just come back to you.	Sitti deebi'uu qofa danda'a.
They want you to do these things.	Wantoota kana akka gootu barbaadu.
I didn't know.	Hin beeku ture.
It's all good!.	Hundi isaa gaarii dha!.
I don't want to do too much of that.	Sana keessaa baay'ee hojjechuu hin barbaadu.
In that case.	Haala sana keessatti.
There was nothing fatherly about him.	Isa keessa wanti abbaa hin turre.
No one could ask for more.	Namni kana caalaa gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
He did more than that.	Kana caalaa hojjete.
It has that feeling.	Miira sana qaba.
He could have done more if he wanted to.	Osoo barbaade kana caalaa hojjechuu danda'a ture.
But they are not the same.	Garuu isaan tokko miti.
There may be three of them.	Isaan keessaa sadii ta’uu danda’a.
Once they could admit she wasn't doing her job.	Yeroo tokko hojii ishee akka hin hojjenne amanuu danda'u turan.
But it is clear.	Garuu ifaadha.
Now what about it? 	Amma maal?
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
I didn't know what that could mean.	Sun maal jechuu akka danda'u hin beeku ture.
But maybe that was good enough.	Tarii garuu sun gaarii ture taʼa.
The timing seemed right.	Yeroon isaa sirrii fakkaata ture.
A long name.	Maqaa dheeraa.
But he didn't do anything.	Garuu homaa hin goone.
We need to have a new voice.	Sagalee haaraa qabaachuu qabna.
But who knows .	Garuu eenyutu beeka .
I don't think it's right.	Ani sirrii natti hin fakkaatu.
You're in a really special place.	Bakka dhuguma adda ta'e keessa jirta.
Hopefully we’re in the house on that.	Sana irratti mana keessa akka galle abdii qabna.
It was just a drink.	Dhugaatii qofa ture.
That’s a possibility.	Sun ta’uu danda’a.
There is nothing you can do now.	Amma wanti ati gochuu dandeessu hin jiru.
Even what we did wasn’t enough.	Wanti nuti hojjenne illee gahaa hin turre.
I don’t want that for you.	Ani akkas siif hin barbaadu.
We had our problems.	Rakkoo keenya qabna turre.
It's all happening again.	Hundi isaa ammas ta'aa jira.
This is all new.	Kun hundi haaraa dha.
Not that it mattered much.	Baay'ee dhimma qaba ture jechuu miti.
It’s the best night.	Halkan hunda caalaa gaarii dha.
We have to go.	Nuti deemuu qabna.
That was the worst.	Sun isa hamaa ture.
A few times.	Yeroo muraasa.
He did not tell his parents what had happened.	Waan taʼe warra isaatti hin himne.
I'm not even sure it's accurate.	Illee sirrii ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
Often, it is not.	Yeroo baayʼee, akkas miti.
Couldn't find one big enough.	Tokko guddaa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
He had no children.	Ijoollee hin qabu ture.
You’re just a housewife.	Ati nama manaa qofa.
Nothing too important.	Wanti baay'ee barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru.
It's not like it couldn't happen.	Akka waan ta'uu dhiisuu danda'u miti.
How it didn’t happen.	Akkamitti hin taane.
Not myself.	Ofii koo miti.
We can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin dandeenyu.
That's how I love you.	Akkasitti si jaalladha.
Not a year.	Waggaa tokko miti.
It’s not a big deal so far.	Hanga ammaatti waan guddaa miti.
They know you have it, you know.	Isaan akka ati qabdu ni beeku, beekta.
But it was more than that, she said.	Garuu kana caalaa ture jette.
You are like my mother.	Ati akka haadha kooti.
He’s still there, he loves it.	Ammallee jira, ni jaallata.
Not in this case.	Haala kana keessatti miti.
It seems to be true.	Dhugaa fakkaata.
Now, maybe that's a good thing.	Amma, tarii sun waan gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
I am in the past.	Ani kan darbe keessa jira.
This usually worked.	Kun yeroo baayʼee ni hojjeta ture.
Language being one of them.	Afaan isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu.
But he did a great job.	Garuu hojii guddaa hojjete.
I will do my best.	Waan danda'u hunda nan godha.
We don’t do this time.	Yeroo kana hin goonu.
I didn’t need any help.	Gargaarsa tokkollee hin barbaanne.
He was a good guy.	Inni nama gaarii ture.
Where she could never return.	Bakka isheen gonkumaa deebi'uu hin dandeenye.
But this is what this job does to you.	Garuu hojiin kun waan si godhu kana.
They may not need help from adults.	Gargaarsa namoota guddaa irraa isaan hin barbaachisu taʼa.
What could be more?.	Kana caalaa maaltu jira?.
No one knows about it.	Namni waa'ee isaa beeku hin jiru.
Anymore.	Kana caalaa.
His evil eyes.	Ija isaa isa hamaa.
I don't love you anymore.	Kana booda si hin jaalladhu.
Someone had to see it.	Namni tokko arguu qaba ture.
But he didn't talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa garuu hin dubbanne.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
They now have two children, a boy and a girl.	Amma ijoollee lama, gurbaa fi intala tokko qabu.
Nothing is the same.	Wanti tokko hin jiru kan wal fakkaatu.
But then, she didn’t speak either.	Garuu sana booda, isheen illee hin dubbanne.
Maybe you can do something about it.	Tarii waan tokko gochuu dandeessu ta'a.
I like my house.	Mana koo natti tola.
It certainly wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
But it can be done.	Garuu ta'uu danda'a.
But it was not without its problems.	Garuu rakkoo isaa malee hin turre.
He thought it was all he had done.	Waan hojjete hunda jedhee yaade.
She didn’t know what to think.	Waan yaaddu hin beektu turte.
There was no one outside.	Namni ala hin turre.
I think this must be a joke.	Kun qoosaa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
It doesn't mean it won't happen.	Hin ta'u jechuu miti.
We have no idea what to do.	Waan goonu yaada hin qabnu.
It doesn’t have a name.	Maqaa hin qabu.
If nothing else, she had a good reputation.	Yoo waan biraa hin taane maqaa gaarii qabdu turte.
That’s just my opinion.	Sun yaada koo qofa.
Largely because of it.	Sababa guddaa sababa isaatiin.
This is how you know yourself.	Haala kanaan of beekta.
He had plenty of time.	Yeroo hedduu qaba ture.
There was nothing there.	Achitti homaa tokkollee hin turre.
I never wanted to live in that place.	Bakka sana jiraachuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
It's just plain wrong to do.	Gochuun dogoggora ifa ta'e qofa.
That’s not the case anymore.	Kana booda akkas miti.
There is no need to answer this.	Kanaaf deebii kennuu hin barbaachisu.
We have children, but not together.	Ijoollee qabna malee waliin miti.
It still works.	Ammas ni hojjeta.
Just look at the name.	Maqaa qofa ilaalaa.
He is the parent.	Inni warra.
No one seemed to be there.	Namni achi hin jiru fakkaata ture.
I’m not kidding you.	Ani sitti qoosaa hin jiru.
Really good food.	Dhuguma nyaata gaarii.
I don’t want to meet him.	Isa waliin wal arguu hin barbaadu.
Being a yearly thing.	Waan waggaa ta'uu.
Last time I couldn’t.	Yeroo darbe hin dandeenye.
To my parents.	Warra kootti.
This is working really well.	Kun dhuguma akka gaariitti hojjechaa jira.
That’s not the whole truth.	Sun dhugaa guutuu miti.
That would be me.	Sun ana ta'a ture.
But I am good at it.	Garuu ani irratti ga'umsa qaba.
You can ask him about that.	Waa'ee sanaa isa gaafachuu dandeessa.
It’s still mine.	Ammallee kan kooti.
But he had his reasons.	Garuu sababa isaa qaba ture.
I didn’t realize you said it, of course.	Akka jette hin hubanne, beekamaadha.
I can't say enough good things about it.	Waa'ee isaa waan gaarii gahaa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
Most of the time, they could have.	Yeroo baay’ee, qabaachuu danda’u turan.
It looks like this.	Kana fakkaata.
It wasn’t too late.	Yeroo booda hin turre.
It won't be a year.	Waggaa hin ta'u.
There is no reason not to.	Sababni hin goone hin jiru.
But he got a life.	Garuu jireenya argate.
We all seem to have the same problem.	Hundi keenya rakkoo tokko qabna fakkaata.
A month later.	Ji'a tokko booda.
Of course, they are not all the same.	Hundi isaanii tokko akka hin taane beekamaadha.
He told himself something.	Waan tokko ofitti hime.
She is a	Isheen nama .
I think that’s true.	Sun dhugaa natti fakkaata.
I think you already know this.	Kana duruu beektu jedheen yaada.
None of them understood his work.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hojii isaa hin hubanne.
That is exactly the problem.	Rakkoon jiru sirriitti kanuma.
He was right in that.	Sana keessatti sirrii ture.
This time, quickly.	Yeroo kana, dafee.
This is probably a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii ta'uu hin oolu.
I didn’t even know myself.	Of illee hin beeku ture.
It was his way.	Karaa isaa ture.
Perhaps you can help him.	Tarii isa gargaaruu dandeessa taʼa.
Just like you, really.	Akkuma kee, dhuguma.
Not ever, probably.	Yoomiyyuu miti, tarii.
I can't go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
I couldn't say it.	Jechuu hin dandeenye.
You shouldn’t eat this.	Kana nyaachuu hin qabdu.
But now we are all good.	Amma garuu hundi keenya gaarii dha.
She was just watching.	Isheen qofa ilaalaa turte.
I would have been watching.	Silaa ilaalaa ture.
They were all bad.	Hundi isaanii hamaa turan.
They weren’t bad people.	Namoota hamaa hin turre.
Maybe even mine.	Tarii kan koo illee ta'uu danda'a.
Like in your own home.	Akka mana ofii keessatti.
But we are not cars.	Garuu nuti konkolaataa miti.
I didn’t know him.	Ani isa hin beeku ture.
Nobody out there knows she’s here.	Namni ala jiru isheen as akka jirtu hin beeku.
That, we have something in common.	Sana, waan wal fakkaatu qabna.
It was a good life for us here .	Jireenya gaarii asitti nuuf ture .
But it is not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti.
But this was not enough.	Garuu kun gahaa hin turre.
You don’t have to say it’s wrong.	Dogoggora jechuu hin qabdu.
He has to work on everything.	Waan hundumaa irratti hojjechuu qaba.
I could be wrong on that.	Sana irratti dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
That would be good.	Sun gaarii ta'a.
They all do that.	Hundi isaanii akkas godhu.
People mostly didn’t.	Namoonni irra caalaa hin goone.
We have limited space.	Bakka muraasa qabna.
Throughout his life.	Jireenya isaa hundumaa keessatti.
This is my voice.	Kun sagalee kooti.
No one looked at them.	Namni isaan ilaale hin jiru.
But not everyone does.	Garuu namni hundi hin godhu.
This doesn't work very well.	Kun baayyee gaarii hin hojjetu.
They may come back a little later.	Xiqqoo booda deebi'uu danda'u.
It doesn’t work, it doesn’t help anything.	Hin hojjetu, homaa hin gargaaru.
Not for him, exactly.	Isaaf miti, sirriitti.
Someone has to know the facts.	Namni tokko dhugaa jiru beekuu qaba.
You’re not the only one.	Si qofa miti.
We got along really well.	Dhuguma akka gaariitti waliin walii galle.
But he was walking on it.	Inni garuu irra deemaa ture.
I love a good time.	Yeroo gaarii nan jaalladha.
If it did, it didn't last long.	Yoo ta'e yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
Why it happened.	Maaliif ta'e.
He is always waiting for me.	Yeroo hundumaa na eegaa jira.
What happens after a third of the time.	Yeroo harka sadii booda maaltu ta'a.
Things went badly for him.	Wanti hamaa isaaf deeme.
I don’t know enough.	Ani gahaa hin beeku.
She hadn’t gone all the way.	Karaa hunda hin deemne turte.
We weren’t there for him.	Isaaf nuti achi hin turre.
He has indeed spoken.	Inni dhuguma dubbateera.
He tried everything.	Waan hundumaa yaale.
I’m very happy, really.	Baayyee gammadeera, dhuguma.
It's all just bad.	Hundi hamaa qofa.
I think it would be a good idea.	Yaada gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada.
We still have another week.	Ammas torban biraa qabna.
He was a boy, really.	Inni gurbaa ture, dhuguma.
Sana ala	Sana ala .
We are not like that.	Nuti akkas miti.
I've said I'll wait for you.	Si eegaa jedheen jira.
You can tell me your name.	Maqaa kee natti himuu dandeessa.
They were still good, just not that good.	Ammallee gaarii turan, hangas gaarii miti qofa.
Not a full sense in that at all.	Sana keessatti miira guutuu miti tasumaa.
It may be necessary, but it’s not enough.	Barbaachisaa ta’uu danda’a, garuu gahaa miti.
It was so obvious to me.	Akkas naaf ifa ture.
It is in the works.	Hojii irra jira.
I never have time.	Yoomiyyuu yeroo hin qabu.
Maybe he knows best.	Tarii inni hunda caalaa beeka ta'a.
Pretty much everything is on the road.	Waan hundumaa baay'ee karaa irra jira.
he thought to himself.	jedhee yaade.
It has no place in his life.	Jireenya isaa keessatti bakka hin qabu.
But it wasn’t, not quite.	Garuu hin turre, guutummaatti miti.
I have a lot of work to do.	Hojii baay'een qaba.
They are looking for favors.	Isaan tola barbaadaa jiru.
Everyone thought that except me.	Ana malee namni hundi akkas jedhee yaade.
So much of it was nonsense.	Kanaaf baay'een isaa waan hin taane ture.
Introduce us to her'.	Ishee waliin nu wal barsiisaa'.
But this was what was needed.	Kun garuu waan barbaachisu ture.
I haven’t even met her.	Ishee waliin illee wal hin argine.
It was still good.	Ammas gaarii ture.
He was a good dog.	Inni saree gaarii ture.
I never tell anyone about it.	Waa'ee kanaa gonkumaa namatti hin himu.
They may have some suggestions that will help you.	Yaada tokko tokko si gargaaru qabaachuu dandaʼu.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
If it were true.	Osoo dhugaa ta'ee.
Something about that mattered.	Waaʼee sanaa wanti tokko barbaachisaa ture.
You can do a lot of work.	Hojii baay'ee hojjechuu dandeessa.
One would be good.	Tokko gaarii ta'a.
I'm not sure.	Ani mirkanaa'aa miti.
Doing it themselves.	Ofii isaanii hojjechuu.
They may very well be.	Isaan baay'ee gaarii ta'uu danda'u.
Great job indeed.	Hojii guddaa dhuguma.
This had to be the big one.	Kun isa guddaa ta'uu qaba ture.
She used to be at home.	Duraan mana turte.
He told her not to do that.	Akkas akka hin goone itti hime.
He was going to be a father.	Abbaa ta'uuf ture.
But that’s how it was, at the time.	Garuu akkas ture, yeroo sanatti.
That’s not a bad idea.	Sun yaada hamaa miti.
He probably knows everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu hin oolu.
We disagreed on what we should do.	Maal gochuu akka qabnu irratti walii hin galle.
It was really easy.	Dhuguma salphaa ture.
Maybe it's the simplicity.	Tarii salphaa ta'uu isaa ta'uu danda'a.
Then they just looked human.	Sana booda nama qofa fakkaatu turan.
I haven’t been able to ask her anything yet.	Hanga ammaatti homaa ishee gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
It was all very well but it didn't work.	Hundi isaa baayyee gaarii ture garuu hin hojjenne.
There was no more time.	Yeroon kana booda hin turre.
But that night was the worst of it.	Halkan sun garuu isa keessaa isa hamaa ture.
It’s just that simple.	Akkasitti salphaa qofa.
You are so good to me.	Ati baay'ee naaf gaarii dha.
He seemed pleased with himself.	Ofitti gammade fakkaata ture.
There was no such thing in his day.	Bara isaatti wanti akkasii hin jiru ture.
He wanted her to be like him.	Akka ishee barbaade.
I don’t care about you, I love you.	Ani siif dhimma hin qabu, si jaalladha.
It's my picture'	Suuraa kooti'.
It looked like that.	Akkas fakkaata ture.
That was even more true now than it was then.	Sun yeroo sana caalaa amma caalaatti dhugaa ture.
Been here for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf as ture.
Nothing would have come of it.	Silaa wanti irraa dhufu hin jiru ture.
Not a bad day.	Guyyaa hamaa miti.
On my shoes maybe, on my clothes.	Kophee koo irratti tarii, uffata koo irratti.
Talking about something.	Waa'ee tokko dubbachuu.
How could that be? 	Akkamitti akkas taʼuu dandaʼa?
I can tell you for nothing.	Waan tokko malee sitti himuu nan danda'a.
Now he's joking.	Amma qoosaa jira.
One of them said he never answered.	Isaan keessaa tokko deebii kenne hin beeku jedheera.
I'm going to go too.	Anis nan deema.
It was just the right thing to do.	Waan sirrii taʼe qofa ture.
Except he had to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu qaba ture malee.
Things no one else does.	Wantoota namni biraa hin hojjenne.
Mostly new doors.	Irra caalaa balbala haaraa.
I think that’s really bad for you.	Sun dhuguma siif hamaa natti fakkaata.
About everything, really.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa, dhuguma.
Something is not right, not right at all.	Wanti tokko sirrii miti, tasumaa sirrii miti.
It’s still early here.	Ammas asitti dafee jira.
Now it is clear	Amma ifaadha .
Maybe that's what it is.	Tarii kanuma ta'uu danda'a.
He seemed unable to speak.	Dubbachuu waan hin dandeenye fakkaata ture.
They don’t care about us.	Isaan nuuf dhimma hin qaban.
But maybe they should be.	Garuu tarii ta'uu qabu.
He wasn’t the same person he used to be.	Nama duraan ture hin turre.
Maybe that's just me.	Tarii sun ana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
No one has passed up here.	Namni as ol darbe darbe hin jiru.
He knew very little.	Inni baayyee xiqqoo beeka ture.
It should have come to me.	Silaa natti dhufuu qaba ture.
We can’t get that .	Akkas argachuu hin dandeenyu .
I always think of you.	Yeroo hundumaa si yaada.
He was doing fine.	Inni gaarii hojjechaa ture.
He may not be in it well.	Inni akka gaariitti keessa jiraachuu dhiisuu danda'a.
I don’t know how to say bad things about people.	Namoota irratti hamaa dubbachuu hin beeku.
That may be too obvious.	Sun garmalee ifa ta’uu danda’a.
We have two rooms together.	Kutaa lama waliin qabna.
She certainly didn’t.	Isheen akka hin goone beekamaadha.
Nothing very special.	Wanti baayyee adda ta'e hin jiru.
He has many ideas.	Yaada hedduu qaba.
He certainly wasn’t alone.	Kophaa isaa akka hin turre beekamaadha.
How to live alone.	Akkamitti kophaa jiraachuu.
I can never do that.	Ani gonkumaa akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
They should know.	Beekuu qabu.
I go to them a lot.	Baay'een isaan bira nan deema.
I know you are the one.	Ati isa tokko ta'uu kee nan beeka.
It’s really just one day.	Dhuguma guyyaa tokko qofa.
It was true.	Dhugaa ture.
I can't handle being alone well.	Kophaa ta'uu akka gaariitti hin danda'u.
The two are exactly the same.	Lamaan isaanii sirriitti wal fakkaatu.
Not at all, really.	Tasumaa miti, dhuguma.
What was, was.	Wanti ture, ture.
She looked nothing like herself.	Isheen homaa of hin fakkaattu turte.
No one is exactly who we think they are.	Namni sirriitti nama nuti yaadne hin jiru.
Not in your own home.	Mana ofii keessa miti.
But he knows it.	Inni garuu ni beeka.
She is new.	Isheen haaraa dha.
But always, always the same people.	Garuu yeroo hundumaa, yeroo hundumaa namoota tokko.
Mother to both sides.	Haadha gara lamaan.
I want more from my food.	Nyaata koo irraa waan baay'een barbaada.
She has her mother.	Haadha ishee qabdi.
You are in me.	Ati ana keessa jirta.
Not there now.	Amma achi miti.
He must have been trying.	Yaalaa ture ta'uu qaba.
It was probably hers.	Kan ishee ta'uu hin oolu.
A lot of things like that happened.	Wanti akkasii baay'ee ta'e.
Tommy came out of it.	Toomiin keessaa ba'e.
We need to do the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e gochuu qabna.
Something inside her seemed to have given way.	Keessa ishee keessatti wanti tokko waan bakka kenne fakkaata ture.
One person, one voice.	Nama tokko, sagalee tokko.
She doesn't have you.	Isheen si hin qabdu.
It was a good question, really.	Gaaffii gaarii ture, dhuguma.
She wasn’t completely alone.	Guutummaatti kophaa ishee hin turre.
Usually, but not always.	Yeroo baayyee, garuu yeroo hunda miti.
So you have to go home.	Kanaaf gara manaatti deebi'uu qabda.
This could be one of them.	Kun isaan keessaa tokko ta’uu danda’a.
He wanted to be good.	Gaarii ta'uu barbaade.
It’s not an issue.	Dhimma hin taane.
Time is not what it seems.	Yeroon waan fakkaatu miti.
You can walk on it.	Irra deemuu dandeessa.
I couldn’t see anything.	Homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
I think maybe she did.	Tarii akkas goote natti fakkaata.
This was not necessary.	Kun barbaachisaa hin turre.
I really don’t know what to do.	Dhuguma maal akkan godhu hin beeku.
It works a lot.	Baay'ee hojjeta.
Not her father's.	Kan abbaa ishee miti.
You still have feelings.	Ammallee miira qabda.
This doesn't work.	Kun hin hojjetu.
There is nothing like us.	Wanti akka keenya hin jiru.
Which would be wrong.	Kan dogoggora ta'a.
I am not sure that will happen.	Akkas akka ta'u mirkanaa'aa miti.
It doesn’t make them bad.	Hamaa isaan hin godhu.
I was evil.	Ani hamaa ture.
It was all she knew.	Isheen waan beektu qofa ture.
Except, it wasn’t.	Malee, hin turre.
Just like you do.	Akkuma ati gootu.
You can talk about your problems.	Rakkoo kee irratti dubbachuu dandeessa.
they just have to do it.	qofa gochuu qabu.
It is not a wife's duty.	Dirqama haadha manaa miti.
We don’t need it.	Nu hin barbaachisu.
What a teacher you are.	Maal barsiisaa taate.
By itself this was pretty cool.	Ofii isaatiin kun baayyee namatti tola ture.
But maybe you're doing something else.	Garuu tarii waan biraa hojjechaa jirta ta'a.
It looks like a lot.	Baayyee fakkaata.
He should have known then.	Silaa yeroo sana beekuu qaba ture.
She had a little dog in her arms.	Saree xiqqoo tokko harka ishee keessaa qabdi turte.
She didn’t want to be here.	Isheen as jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
I could eat all day.	Guyyaa guutuu nyaachuu nan danda'a ture.
You just look at those two.	Isin warra lamaan sana qofa ilaalaa.
Now he certainly has.	Amma akka qabu beekamaadha.
In my room.	Kutaa koo keessatti.
It was a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa ture.
So he had no answer.	Kanaaf deebii hin qabu ture.
Not identical, but similar .	Wal fakkaataa miti, garuu wal fakkaata .
You must have no one but me.	Ana malee nama tokkollee qabaachuu hin qabdu.
They are on the road.	Karaa irra jiru.
Just a lot of it.	Baay'ee isaa qofa.
You think you do.	Ati waan gootu sitti fakkaata.
But what it was.	Garuu maal akka ture.
No one said that, but it sure was.	Namni akkas jedhe hin jiru, garuu mirkanaa'aa ture.
But he didn’t go.	Garuu inni hin deemne.
You don't need to make a big deal about it.	Waa'ee kanaa waan guddaa gochuun si hin barbaachisu.
The work is obvious why.	Hojiin maaliif akka ta'e ifaadha.
They always do it.	Yeroo hundumaa ni godhu.
This should work just fine.	Kun akka gaariitti hojjechuu qaba.
One of them will work.	Isaan keessaa tokko ni hojjeta.
But that’s not it.	Garuu sun miti.
We just met yesterday morning.	Kaleessa ganama qofa wal argine.
I can't see any other way.	Karaa biraa arguu hin danda'u.
You know that's how it's supposed to be.	Akkas ta'uu akka qabu ni beekta.
I know you will do your best.	Waan dandeessu hunda akka gootu nan beeka.
Better not talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu dhiisuu wayya.
Times are more clear.	Yeroon caalaatti ifaadha.
All are the same to us.	Hundi nuuf tokko.
They may not see us, but we are there.	Nu arguu dhiisuu danda'u, garuu nuti achi jirra.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
I don't have anything	Ani homaa hin qabu .
Everything was fuzzy in the room around us.	Kutaa naannoo keenya jiru keessatti wanti hundi ifa hin taane ture.
You can't stay.	Turuu hin dandeessu.
They need our help.	Gargaarsa keenya isaan barbaachisa.
But we should have known.	Garuu silaa beekuu qabna turre.
Very, very dangerous.	Baayyee baayyee balaa qaba.
It must be a house.	Mana ta'uu qaba.
My luck didn’t last all year.	Carraan koo waggaa guutuu hin turre.
You have to have the road with you.	Karaa si waliin qabaachuu qabda.
They're good about that.	Isaan waa'ee sanaa gaarii dha.
It's a good thing this doesn't have to happen anymore.	Kana booda kun ta'uu akka hin qabne waan gaarii dha.
They may have something for you to do.	Waan siif gootu qabaachuu dandaʼu.
Maybe he's doing both?.	Tarii lamaan isaanii hojjechaa jira ta'a?.
I like to just do my thing.	Waan koo qofa hojjechuu nan jaalladha.
He is not a newcomer.	Inni nama haaraa miti.
There is nothing here.	Wanti as hin jiru.
But that’s not it .	Garuu sun miti .
It wasn’t, of course.	Hin turre, beekamaadha.
All that matters is time.	Wanti jiru yeroo qofa.
That's how it happened, really.	Akkas ta'e, dhuguma.
He should not have done this.	Silaa kana gochuu hin qabu ture.
They know exactly what that is.	Sun maal akka ta’e sirriitti beeku.
I looked at my wife again.	Ammas haadha manaa koo ilaale.
You don’t know them .	Ati isaan hin beektu .
I enjoyed it very much.	Baay'ee itti gammadeera.
But I will say this.	Ani garuu kana nan jedha.
Please and	Mee fi .
I was very happy for him.	Isaaf baay'een gammade.
We need more of them.	Isaan kana caalaa nu barbaachisa.
He wasn’t going to do anything.	Homaa gochuuf hin turre.
Not tonight, maybe not ever.	Halkan kana miti, tarii gonkumaa miti.
I can't speak from the outside of that.	Sana ala irraa dubbachuu hin danda'u.
No problem, though.	Rakkoo hin qabu garuu.
He lived alone.	Inni kophaa isaa jiraata ture.
Everything seems to be there.	Wanti hundi waan jiru fakkaata.
Something is definitely happening that we don’t realize.	Wanti nuti hin hubanne tokko ta’aa akka jiru beekamaadha.
We have to let go, though.	Dhiisuu qabna garuu.
No one else was here.	Namni biraa as hin turre.
I couldn’t go alone this time.	Yeroo kana kophaa deemuu hin dandeenye.
I wasn’t there.	Ani achi hin turre.
It’s here.	Halkan dha.
So they should be very accurate.	Kanaaf baay’ee sirrii ta’uu qabu.
Now she had it.	Amma qabdi turte.
It was a while ago.	Yeroo muraasa dura ture.
I can't get enough of them.	Isaan gahaa argachuu hin danda'u.
He probably should have known better.	Inni tarii kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
Not big enough to do that just yet.	Amma qofa akkas gochuuf guddaa miti.
Except for my home, there was nowhere to go.	Mana koo malee, bakka itti deemu hin turre.
But the timing wasn’t right.	Garuu yeroon isaa sirrii hin turre.
The problem was, I didn't know what it was.	Rakkoon ture, maal akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
But he obviously did.	Garuu akka godhe ifaadha.
Now, we’re all busy.	Amma, hundi keenya hojii baay’ee qabna.
This no longer works.	Kun kana booda hin hojjetu.
But you’re not there.	Garuu ati hin jirtu.
This book is.	Kitaaba kana.
With ways and desires.	Karaa fi fedhii waliin.
No one knew.	Namni beeku hin turre.
After all this time you did.	Yeroo kana hunda booda ati goote.
Now it’s just me and him.	Amma ana fi isa qofa.
I know it will happen.	Akka ta'u nan beeka.
I hesitated by the door.	Anis balbala bira duubatti jedheen.
That’s dangerous.	Sun balaa qaba.
But something different happened.	Garuu wanti adda ta'e ta'e.
We can’t go wrong here.	Asitti dogoggora deemuu hin dandeenyu.
He could be wrong tonight.	Halkan kana dogoggora ta'uu danda'a.
No one was really happy.	Namni dhuguma gammade hin jiru.
You must be with us.	Nu waliin ta'uu qabdu.
It had everything we needed.	Waan nu barbaachisu hunda qaba ture.
Everyone has to work together.	Hundi waliin hojjechuu qabu.
It's never going to happen.	Gonkumaa ta'uuf hin deemu.
It could be something very new.	Waan baayyee haaraa ta'uu danda'a.
It is working without any problems.	Rakkoo tokko malee hojjechaa jira.
He was my guy.	Inni gurbaa koo ture.
I want you to know this.	Kana akka beektu nan barbaada.
He should have known that.	Silaa sana beekuu qaba ture.
But that is certainly not certain.	Garuu sun mirkanaa'aa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Things seemed different.	Wanti jiru adda fakkaata ture.
But we need your help.	Garuu gargaarsa keessan nu barbaachisa.
From the old stuff.	Wantoota durii irraa.
He wanted to find them.	Isaan argachuu barbaade.
We both saw you.	Lamaan keenyayyuu si argine.
You probably haven't seen it.	Ati hin argine ta'a.
He couldn't come.	Dhufuu hin dandeenye.
But he really didn’t.	Garuu dhuguma hin goone.
I don't know what exactly the timing will be.	Yeroon isaa sirriitti maal akka ta'u hin beeku.
Sometimes, it just doesn’t work.	Yeroo tokko tokko, hin hojjetu qofa.
You don't know me.	Ati naaf hin beektu.
It was one of the greatest nights of my life.	Halkan jireenya koo keessatti halkan guddaa taʼe keessaa tokko ture.
Maybe it's a joke.	Tarii qoosaa ta'uu danda'a.
Many people go.	Namoonni baay'een deemu.
But this one another time.	Garuu kan kanaa yeroo biraa.
They know better.	Isaan caalaatti beeku.
All for the better.	Hundi gara gaariitti.
I think on your place.	Bakka keessan irratti natti fakkaata.
She shouldn't have been like that.	Isheen akkas ta'uu hin qabdu turte.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Kana booda dhimma hin qabu.
It is better not to talk too much.	Garmalee dubbachuu dhiisuu wayya.
I wonder how it goes for you.	Akkamitti akka siif deemu yoo natti tola.
I had no idea what it was.	Maal akka ta'e yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
If you’re good, you’re good.	Yoo gaarii taate gaarii dha.
I am that good.	Ani akkasitti gaarii dha.
I looked him in the eye.	Anis ija keessa ilaale.
He is your father and he loves you.	Inni abbaa kee fi inni si jaallata.
I didn't tell him what it was.	Maal akka ta'e itti hin himne.
I don't want much.	Waan baay'ee hin barbaadu.
Look at that little guy.	Mee gurbaa xiqqoo sana ilaalaa.
Perhaps she had.	Tarii qabdi turte taʼa.
He says it's too much.	Garmalee jedha.
This is my daughter.	Kun intala kooti.
We were the only car on the road.	Konkolaataa karaa irra ture nu qofa ture.
It couldn't be easier.	Salphaa ta'uu hin dandeenye.
It should come soon.	Dafee dhufuu qaba.
I hope he likes them.	Akka isaan jaallatu abdiin qaba.
Sometimes it was a chore.	Yeroo tokko tokko hojii manaa taʼa ture.
I mean, good.	Gaarii jechuu kooti.
It's going to be different for you.	Siif adda ta'uuf deema.
I’ve been working all morning.	Ganama guutuu hojjechaa ture.
He already knows me.	Inni duruu na beeka.
Perhaps that is asking too much.	Tarii sun garmalee gaafachuu taʼuu dandaʼa.
That’s really what they need to do.	Dhuguma waan isaan gochuu qaban kana.
I came across this today.	Har'a kanaan wal arge.
I am still happy.	Ammas gammadeera.
But then I have no idea.	Garuu sana booda yaada hin qabu.
No one could find my mother.	Namni haadha koo argachuu hin dandeenye.
Then when she said.	Sana booda yeroo jette.
There these two.	Achitti lamaan isaanii kana.
But maybe that's not a problem.	Garuu tarii sun rakkoo hin qabu ta'a.
It was a nonsense.	Waan hin taane ture.
The exact time is not important.	Yeroon sirrii ta'e barbaachisaa miti.
We did well here.	Asitti waan gaarii hojjenne.
I'm probably one of them.	Ani tarii isaan keessaa tokko ta'uu hin oolu.
It is	Ni .
That sounds more like me, than you.	Sun caalaatti na fakkaata, si caalaa.
In the car on the way home.	Konkolaataa keessa karaa manaa.
Except she was rarely wrong.	Yeroo muraasaaf dogoggora ta'uu ishee malee.
It had been	Ta'ee turee .
You don't want to live.	Jiraachuu hin barbaaddu.
But it’s nothing else.	Garuu waan biraa miti.
There was nothing anyone could do for him.	Wanti namni tokkollee isaaf gochuu danda'u hin turre.
That took some time.	Sun yeroo fudhate.
Our mother is not real.	Haadha keenya dhugaa miti.
It wasn’t great.	Guddaa hin turre.
Nothing like that has happened before.	Amma dura wanti akkasii hin jiru.
They absolutely need to be more.	Isaan kana caalaa ta'uu guutummaatti isaan barbaachisa.
I didn’t have it before.	Kana dura hin qabu ture.
I'm looking for it.	Ani nan barbaada.
But there is more to it than that, of course.	Garuu kana caalaa wanti akka jiru beekamaadha.
Today was a pretty great day.	Har'a guyyaa baayyee guddaa ture.
It’s in all their languages.	Afaan isaanii hunda keessa jira.
We were a little while ago.	Yeroo xiqqoo turre.
Tonight must be the night.	Halkan kana halkan ta'uu qaba.
I know really well.	Ani dhuguma sirriitti beeka.
Not so much about luck there.	Waa'ee carraa achitti baay'ee miti.
You can go all the way back.	Karaa hundumaa duubatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
Then you will know.	Sana booda ni beekta.
Only one person.	Nama tokko qofa.
He must come to us.	Gara keenya dhufuu qaba.
Lots of jokes.	Qoosaa baay'ee.
He had to know what had happened.	Waan taʼe beekuu qaba ture.
Then its wrong.	Sana booda dogoggora isaa.
Sometimes a long time.	Yeroo tokko tokko yeroo dheeraa.
Not exactly human.	Sirriitti nama miti.
He had to eat something.	Waan tokko nyaachuu qaba ture.
I'm saying that.	Ani akkas jedha.
But that’s not what we have.	Garuu waan nuti qabnu kana miti.
The problem still exists.	Rakkoon ammallee jira.
But he had to go somewhere.	Garuu bakka tokko deemuu qaba ture.
This is not always the case, however.	Kun yeroo hunda hin ta'u garuu.
You have to go with them.	Isaan waliin deemuu qabda.
Not that she didn’t want to do it.	Isheen gochuu hin barbaanne jechuu miti.
Waiting right outside with my wife and daughter.	Haadha manaa koo fi intala koo waliin sirriitti ala eegaa jiru.
Maybe you'll be fine.	Tarii gaarii ta'uu dandeessa.
She was becoming a mother.	Isheen haadha ta'aa turte.
She should know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qabdi.
Nan his even.	Nan isaa illee.
Look at yourself, there.	Of ilaalaa, achitti.
Not asking for much.	Waan baay'ee gaafachuu miti.
She must be, he thought.	Isheen ta'uu qabdi jedhee yaade.
It’s not that bad.	Akkasitti hamaa miti.
Time is not important.	Yeroon barbaachisaa miti.
She was still there.	Ammallee achi turte.
But his voice is different.	Garuu sagalee isaa adda ta'e.
But that's really what happened this week.	Garuu dhuguma torban kana keessa kan ta'e kanuma.
They have that.	Sana qabu.
Everyone can eat this.	Kana namni hundi nyaachuu danda'a.
But maybe now, you know, you should go.	Garuu tarii amma, beekta, deemuu qabda ta'a.
It would be a mistake on my part.	Ana irraa dogoggora ta'a.
I thought this was a great book.	Kun kitaaba guddaa natti fakkaate.
I don’t think you ever will.	Yoomiyyuu waan gootu natti hin fakkaatu.
They can be real.	Isaan dhugaa ta’uu danda’u.
He wouldn’t have told me.	Silaa natti hin himu ture.
I love my life with you.	Jireenya koo si waliin baay'een jaalladha.
He doesn’t want you.	Inni si hin barbaadu.
Maybe you didn't have one.	Tarii tokko hin qabdu turte ta'a.
He's been great.	Inni guddaa ta'ee jira.
He should have done that sooner.	Silaa dafee sana gochuu qaba ture.
With a little bit.	Xiqqoo qabu waliin.
He's looking for me.	Na barbaadaa jira.
This is what happened to me.	Wanti natti dhufe kun.
He had a life here.	Jireenya asitti qaba ture.
This was a good one.	Kun gaarii ture.
He will be someone else for a while now.	Amma yeroo muraasaaf nama biraa ta'a.
That was just one of those things.	Sun wantoota sana keessaa tokko qofa ture.
Which again wasn’t, of course.	Kan ammas hin turre, beekamaadha.
This is not helpful.	Kun gargaarsa miti.
I'm very excited.	Baay'een gammadeera.
She raises her eyebrows.	Ija ishee ol qabdi.
I may find myself alone.	Kophaa koo of argachuu danda'a.
It was a great job.	Hojii guddaa ture.
But he didn't do anything.	Garuu homaa hin goone.
But more than nothing.	Garuu homaa hin taane caalaa.
You can’t do that.	Sana gochuu hin dandeessu.
He has to go.	Inni deemuu qaba.
I had no idea what this could be.	Kun maal ta’uu akka danda’u yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I saw a little girl.	Intala xiqqoo arge.
It is always in .	Yeroo hundumaa keessa jira .
It’s not really necessary.	Dhuguma barbaachisaa miti.
Sometimes I think no one can.	Yeroo tokko tokko namni tokkollee hin danda'u jedheen yaada.
Still there was no one at all.	Ammas tasumaa namni tokkollee hin turre.
But it was good enough.	Garuu gaarii gahaa ture.
I haven’t been able to find them yet.	Hanga ammaatti isaan argachuu hin dandeenye.
I still wasn't sure.	Ammallee mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
We have a lot on him from before.	Duraan irraa waan baay'ee isa irratti qabna.
He’s not the worst.	Inni isa hamaa miti.
Not more than that.	Caalaatti miti.
I hope it can come soon.	Dafee dhufuu akka danda'u abdiin qaba.
But they really don’t have to.	Garuu dhuguma dirqama hin qaban.
I couldn’t ask her.	Ishee gaafachuu hin dandeenye.
He said once.	Yeroo tokko jedhe.
It's probably not important.	Barbaachisaa ta'uu dhiisuu hin oolu.
There is no one outside.	Namni ala hin jiru.
You don’t even have to be here.	Ati as jiraachuu illee hin qabdu.
It’s not that easy.	Akkas salphaa miti.
You know you don’t have this money.	Maallaqa kana akka hin qabne ni beektu.
I didn't see you.	Si hin argine.
In her household.	Mana ishee keessatti.
I know you want kids.	Ijoollee akka barbaaddu nan beeka.
So he didn't say much.	Kanaaf waan baay'ee hin dubbanne.
It seemed neat enough but sleepy.	Sirrii gahaa fakkaata ture garuu hirriba.
It usually has a dog on it.	Yeroo baayyee saree irra jiru qaba.
Daily work.	Hojii guyyaa guyyaa.
They just think they have it.	Qaban qofa itti fakkaata.
He wanted to be with her.	Ishee waliin ta'uu barbaade.
Not too sure of myself.	Of irratti garmalee mirkanaa'aa miti.
It’s all there.	Hundi isaa jira.
So it’s dangerous.	Kanaaf balaa qaba.
He didn't do that.	Akkas hin goone.
Then she’s the only one.	Sana booda isheen qofa.
It’s day, it’s night.	Guyyaa dha, halkan dha.
We’re just trying to help him.	Isa gargaaruuf qofa yaalaa jirra.
It’s not enough of him.	Isa gahaa miti.
It seemed to have.	Qabu fakkaata ture.
It’s not a mistake.	Dogoggora miti.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Garuu tarii sun waan gaarii ta'uu danda'a.
It was my mother’s.	Kan haadha kooti ture.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Garuu isa qofa hin turre.
This happens to all parents.	Kun warra hunda irratti ni ta’a.
We are not the problem.	Nuti rakkoo hin taane.
That'll be tomorrow.	Sun boru ta'a.
She should have gone a long time ago.	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura deemuu qabdi turte.
But it should work well.	Garuu akka gaariitti hojjechuu qaba.
I hope you don’t have to tonight.	Halkan kana dirqama akka hin qabne abdiin qaba.
I don't want to know anything about them.	Waa'ee isaanii homaa beekuu hin barbaadu.
It probably never will be.	Yoomiyyuu ta'uu hin oolu.
You are always there.	Yeroo hundumaa achi jirta.
I think you should go to him.	Gara isaa deemuu qabda jedheen yaada.
She was who she used to be.	Isheen duraan eenyu akka turte turte.
But he wouldn’t do it.	Garuu hin godhu ture.
He has only one life.	Jireenya tokko qofa qaba.
He was the worst.	Inni hunda caalaa hamaa ture.
It worked very well.	Baayyee hojjete.
It obviously doesn’t work.	Akka hin hojjenne ifaadha.
That will never happen.	Sun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
Now it's clear.	Amma ifa ta'e.
Not in real life, nobody would do that.	Jireenya dhugaa keessatti osoo hin taane namni waan akkasii hin hojjetu ture.
I don’t like not doing anything.	Homaa gochuu dhiisuu hin jaalladhu.
But this is not always the case.	Garuu kun yeroo hundumaa akkas hin ta’u.
It’s not you.	Ati miti.
What more can you ask for.	Kana caalaa maal gaafachuu dandeessa.
The time of day doesn’t matter.	Yeroon guyyaa homaa hin qabu.
That’s usually the case.	Yeroo baay’ee akkas ta’a.
It doesn't seem right.	Sirrii hin fakkaatu.
Maybe you weren't.	Tarii ati hin turre ta'a.
Wrong.	Dogoggora.
I thought it was great.	Guddaa natti fakkaate.
This happens quite often.	Kun yeroo baay’ee ni ta’a.
But now that matters little.	Amma garuu sun dhimma xiqqoo qaba.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
It was always your biggest problem.	Yeroo hundumaa rakkoo kee isa guddaa ture.
Age was the most important risk factor.	Umuriin sababa balaa isa hunda caalaa barbaachisaa ture.
Perhaps that is the case here.	Tarii asitti akkas taʼuu dandaʼa.
He probably should have spoken up a long time ago.	Silaa yeroo dheeraa dura dubbachuu qaba ture ta'a.
She didn’t have to.	Isheen dirqama hin turre.
Maybe they're all just good friends.	Tarii hundi isaanii hiriyyoota gaarii qofa ta'uu danda'u.
I had no idea it would be you.	Si ta'a jedhee yaada hin qabu ture.
But for us it was really, really bad.	Garuu nuuf dhuguma, dhuguma hamaa ture.
But that’s not necessary right now.	Garuu yeroo ammaa kana sun barbaachisaa miti.
. . . .	.
But even this didn’t happen.	Garuu kun illee hin taane.
They have children.	Ijoollee qabu.
I couldn’t see anyone.	Nama tokkollee arguu hin dandeenye.
I need some help with something.	Waan tokko irratti gargaarsa tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
That you know.	Akka ati beektu.
I mean, we can’t go now.	Amma deemuu hin dandeenyu jechuu kooti.
A homeless person in need of medical assistance.	Nama mana hin qabne gargaarsa yaalaa barbaadu.
It was pretty easy for me.	Naaf baayyee salphaa ture.
Luck just looked at him.	Carraan isa ilaale qofa.
She had no reason to be.	Sababa akkas ta'uuf hin qabdu turte.
I think it's a good thing.	Waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
She had her answer.	Deebii ishee qabdi turte.
That’s not our job.	Sun hojii keenya miti.
It is at the risk of saying there is too much.	Garmalee jira jechuun balaa irra jira.
I’ll let you know it doesn’t work.	Akka hin hojjenne akka beektu nan godha.
They don’t have shoes.	Kophee hin qaban.
Three weeks later.	Torban sadii booda.
I can live here, I can buy my food here.	As jiraachuu nan danda'a, nyaata koo as bitachuu nan danda'a.
It is not clear what this means.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka ta’e ifa miti.
Me, with my new clothes.	Ana, uffata koo haaraa waliin.
I looked at myself.	Anis of ilaale.
But something was different.	Garuu wanti tokko adda ture.
Fortunately, you never have to.	Akka carraa ta'ee gonkumaa dirqama hin qabdu.
Clothes exactly like us.	Uffata sirriitti akkuma keenya.
We can’t help each other.	Wal gargaaruu hin dandeenyu.
My problem seems to lie mostly in the regression department.	Rakkoon koo irra caalaa kutaa duubatti deebi'uu keessa waan jiru fakkaata.
You're kidding.	Qoosaa jirta.
Not that he really meant it.	Dhuguma jechuu isaa miti.
Not for him, but for you.	Isaaf osoo hin taane siif.
I doubt that is the case.	Akkas akka ta'e nan shakka.
I know what he's saying.	Waan jedhu nan beeka.
He likes a little dog way more than most people.	Nama baay'ee caalaa karaa saree xiqqoo jaallata.
Without one hand.	Harka tokko malee.
It is not necessary, it is not complete.	Hin barbaachisu, guutuu hin qabu.
That’s all we have.	Qabnu kana qofa.
But it’s not that simple.	Garuu akkas salphaa miti.
I’ve always wanted you.	Yeroo hundumaa si barbaada ture.
This work cannot be reversed.	Hojiin kun duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
He wasn’t indifferent.	Dhimma hin qabne hin turre.
Someone came out.	Namni tokko ba'e.
It’s in you.	Si keessa jira.
It was a little early.	Xiqqoo dafee ture.
But they’re not all that bad.	Garuu hundi isaanii hangas hamaa miti.
He doesn’t do any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin godhu.
She had children.	Ijoollee qabdi turte.
That you don’t want to, obviously.	Akka hin barbaaddu, ifaadha.
I'm going to go too.	Anis deemaa jira.
But that wasn’t easy.	Garuu wanti sun salphaa hin turre.
I know there’s more to it than that.	Kana caalaa akka jiru nan beeka.
Tell me if it works.	Yoo hojjete himi.
We don't have to talk about it.	Waa'ee isaa dubbachuu hin qabnu.
He wanted to be alone.	Kophaa ta'uu barbaade.
It wasn't knowing.	Beekuu hin turre.
They may be right.	Isaan sirrii taʼuu dandaʼu.
Towards me.	Gara kootti.
It was in that moment.	Yeroo sana keessa ture.
They needed sleep.	Hirriba isaan barbaachisa ture.
This must be the case.	Kun ta'uu qaba.
. . . .	.
That person is in no real danger.	Namni sun balaa dhugaa keessa hin jiru.
I didn't know why then, why.	Yeroo sana maaliif, maaliif akka ta'e hin beeku ture.
Should.	Ta'uu qaba.
Now there is no hesitation for me.	Amma naaf duubatti deebi'uu hin qabu.
You are extremely alone here.	Asitti garmalee kophaa kee jirta.
They certainly would.	Silaa akkas godhu beekamaadha.
He knew this well.	Kana sirriitti beeka ture.
I can't have any other ideas.	Yaada biraa qabaachuu hin danda'u.
That can never be without error.	Sun dogoggora malee gonkumaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
They had no chance.	Carraa hin qaban turan.
Tomorrow night, it would be the new moon.	Boru halkan, ji'a haaraa ta'a ture.
But it wasn’t enough.	Garuu gahaa hin turre.
Does anyone have any idea what it could be??.	Maal ta'uu akka danda'u namni yaada qabu jiraa??.
It's just not on it.	Irratti hin jiru qofa.
It doesn’t seem to be working.	Kan hojjetu hin fakkaatu.
I couldn’t have them around like you.	Akka kee naannoo kootti isaan qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
It seems about time.	Waa'ee yeroon isaa waan ta'e fakkaata.
He didn't tell anyone.	Namatti hin himne.
It’s my voice.	Sagalee kooti.
So then we were there.	Kanaaf sana booda achi turre.
You don’t have to do that.	Ati akkas gochuu hin qabdu.
Some money, maybe.	Maallaqa tokko tokko, tarii.
There was no one in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa namni hin turre.
I hope it wasn’t too wrong.	Baayyee dogoggora akka hin turre abdiin qaba.
I hope it helps you.	Akka isin gargaaru abdiin qaba.
I just don't know enough about this stuff.	Ani waa'ee waan kanaa gahaa hin beeku qofa.
Please tell me about yourself.	Mee waa'ee kee natti himi.
Again, to be clear.	Ammas ifa ta'uuf.
No one can do that for him.	Namni akkas isaaf gochuu hin danda'u.
No one said much.	Namni baay'ee dubbate hin jiru.
She thought she was doing the right thing.	Waan sirrii hojjechaa akka jirtu itti fakkaate.
But during questioning, someone asked him about it.	Garuu yeroo gaaffii keessa namni tokko waa'ee isaa isa gaafate.
But we had it.	Garuu qabna turre.
I want to find her.	Ishee argachuu barbaada.
Not so sure about them.	Waa'ee isaanii hangas mirkanaa'aa miti.
But it’s not an easy book.	Garuu kitaaba salphaa miti.
He wanted me to tell him about it.	Waa'ee kanaa akkan itti himu barbaade.
Today that was no problem at all.	Har'a sun tasumaa rakkoo hin qabu ture.
So it had to be something else.	Kanaaf waan biraa ta'uu qaba ture.
I don't know much about anything.	Waa'ee homaa baay'ee hin beeku.
Nothing more happened.	Kana caalaa wanti ta'e hin jiru.
I’m not there already.	Ani amma dura achi hin jiru.
Just to be clear.	Akka ifa ta'uuf qofa.
But wait, wait, wait.	Garuu eegaa eegaa eegaa.
I have no answer to this.	Kanaaf deebii hin qabu.
There was nothing there in our area.	Naannoo keenya keessatti achitti wanti tokkollee hin turre.
I’ve always wanted you.	Yeroo hundumaa si barbaada ture.
One happens in the present.	Tokko yeroo ammaa keessa ta'a.
You just want some time with a good time.	Yeroo gaarii waliin yeroo tokko tokko qofa barbaaddu.
You are in serious danger.	Balaa hamaa keessa jirta.
But he wasn’t one of them.	Garuu inni isaan keessaa tokko hin turre.
It didn’t seem to work.	Waan hojjetu hin fakkaatu ture.
That said, he came out.	Kana jechuun ba'e.
I told him about you.	Waa'ee kee itti hime.
Good guy, all parts.	Gurbaa gaarii, kutaa hunda.
Forgiveness takes time.	Dhiifama gochuun yeroo barbaada.
You're going to.	Ati gara...
He was a guy who made you think.	Gurbaa akka ati yaaddu godhe ture.
Maybe it's not.	Tarii ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
He had a place to go.	Bakka itti deemu qaba ture.
Everything important was there.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e hundi achi ture.
I know it’s dangerous.	Balaa akka qabu nan beeka.
The father has a voice.	Abbaa sagalee qaba.
I didn't care.	Ani dhimma hin qabu ture.
There is always something you can do better.	Yeroo hundumaa wanti kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessu tokko jira.
As they should have been.	Akkuma silaa ta'uu qabu.
I didn’t want to be here like that.	Ani akkasitti as jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
That’s never good enough.	Sun gonkumaa gaarii miti.
There is no answer.	Deebii hin qabu.
I didn't understand her.	Ishee hin hubanne.
We are still looking for a place.	Ammas bakka barbaadaa jirra.
We can’t do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
It’s really a good thing.	Dhuguma waan gaarii dha.
He did a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee hojjete.
I knew his wife.	Haadha manaa isaa nan beeka ture.
He even thought they had it.	Qaban illee itti fakkaate.
As .	Akka .
No one would have known us there.	Silaa achitti namni nu beeku hin jiru.
You have to know.	Beekuu qabda.
He still didn’t tell her that, of course.	Ammas akkas itti hin himne beekamaadha.
It should be easy.	Salphaa ta'uu qaba.
Everyone had to be around all the time.	Namni hundi yeroo hunda naannoo sana jiraachuu qaba ture.
They know a great deal about you.	Waa'ee kee waan guddaa beeku.
Except that it doesn’t.	Akka hin taane malee.
But then, that was nothing new.	Garuu sana booda, sun waan haaraa hin turre.
I don’t want him to know.	Akka inni beeku hin barbaadu.
Another, another, another.	Kan biraa, kan biraa, kan biraa.
But you have to tell me what's going on.	Garuu waan ta'aa jiru natti himuu qabda.
I didn't want to tell him I couldn't play.	Taphachuu hin danda'u itti himuu hin barbaanne.
There was nothing he could say.	Wanti inni jechuu danda'u hin turre.
It would all be on your terms.	Hundi isaa haala keessan irratti ta'a ture.
Then their problems began.	Sana booda rakkoon isaanii jalqabe.
There just wasn’t time.	Yeroon hin turre qofa.
This was all good.	Kun hundi gaarii ture.
They love their children very much.	Ijoollee isaanii baay'ee jaallatu.
I would have liked to know her better.	Silaa caalaatti ishee beekuu nan barbaada ture.
I've always been so sure of myself.	Yeroo hundumaa akkasitti ofitti mirkanaa'aa ture.
We have a place waiting for you.	Bakka isin eegaa jiru qabna.
This seems to be the answer.	Kun deebii ta'a fakkaata.
People are happening a lot in life.	Namoonni jireenya keessatti waan baay'ee ta'aa jiru.
Nothing else was working.	Wanti biraa hojjechaa hin turre.
We don’t have to get any more money.	Maallaqa biraa argachuu hin qabnu.
So far it works great.	Hanga ammaatti baayyee hojjeta.
It couldn't be simpler.	Kana caalaa salphaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
She wasn't sure what to do at the time.	Yeroo sanatti maal akka gootu mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
Clearly, that is not the case here.	Asitti akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
He was just a man.	Inni nama qofa ture.
Everyone who goes with them.	Kan isaan waliin deemu hunda.
There was plenty of others.	Kan biraa baay'ee ture.
I’m doing better than that.	Ani kana caalaa hojjechaa jira.
To do this.	Kana hojjechuuf.
You have no way to go.	Karaa itti deemtu hin qabdu.
I can tell you what's in it.	Waan keessa jiru sitti himuu nan danda'a.
I think it's a good one.	Kan gaarii natti fakkaata.
I hope everything is different now.	Amma wanti hundi adda akka ta'u abdiin qaba.
It's almost like you want me to leave.	Akkan akkan deemu barbaaddu jechuun ni danda'ama.
She is ever so right.	Isheen yoomiyyuu akkasitti sirrii dha.
No one wanted to know anything.	Namni homaa beekuu hin barbaanne.
They are nobody.	Isaan nama tokkollee miti.
I mean, look at it.	Mee ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
This doesn't seem to have happened.	Kun waan ta'e hin fakkaatu.
Look at a little bit of hope.	Abdii xiqqoo tokko ilaalaa.
I have to go.	Deemuun qaba.
Ours is really good.	Kan keenya dhuguma gaarii dha.
But it is not true.	Garuu dhugaa miti.
I thought this was a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii natti fakkaate.
I was more than indifferent at the time.	Yeroo sanatti dhimma hin qabne caalaa ture.
It looked big and dangerous.	Guddaa fi balaa kan qabu fakkaata ture.
But that wasn't really what happened at the party.	Garuu dhuguma affeerraa sana irratti wanti ta'e akkas hin turre.
It would be a dog life.	Jireenya saree ta'a ture.
I’m not even kidding you right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana sitti qoosaa illee miti.
All the friends.	Hiriyyoota hunda.
I think that’s good.	Sun gaarii natti fakkaata.
He seems to understand everything.	Waan hundumaa waan hubate fakkaata.
They hadn’t spoken in a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf wal hin dubbanne turan.
That wasn’t how it was supposed to go.	Akkasitti deemuu qabu hin turre.
So much for that.	Kanaaf baay'ee.
Like a mother, like a daughter.	Akka haadha, akka intala.
We never have anything in common.	Waan wal fakkaatu gonkumaa hin qabnu.
They would be on it for a long time.	Silaa yeroo dheeraaf irra jiru.
But he was such a man.	Inni garuu nama akkasii ture.
I didn't say anything else to him.	Waan biraa itti hin dubbanne.
I had no idea about it.	Waa'ee kanaa yaada tokkollee hin qabu ture.
We all worked late.	Hundi keenya yeroon booda hojjenne.
I couldn’t find any.	Tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
But we are there.	Garuu achi jirra.
It’s not just me.	Ana qofa miti.
Certainly not so bad .	Akkas hamaa akka hin taane beekamaadha .
As soon as you have the space.	Akkuma bakka sana qabdu.
I want to see you so badly.	Akka malee si arguu barbaada.
Questions that require many answers.	Gaaffii deebii hedduu barbaadu.
Everything works fine except for one thing.	Waan tokko malee wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
We did all of that.	Sana hunda hojjenne.
Please	Mee .
They want to be good, they want to be great.	Gaarii ta'uu barbaadu, guddaa ta'uu barbaadu.
I want to be a good guy.	Ani gurbaa gaarii ta'uu barbaada.
You're not bad.	Ati hamaa miti.
I doubt there is anyone inside.	Keessa namni jiraachuu isaa nan shakka.
But this can’t be different.	Garuu kun adda ta’uu hin danda’u.
She's a good one.	Isheen gaarii dha.
He didn’t work anymore that night.	Halkan sana kana booda hin hojjenne.
It was always ours.	Yeroo hundumaa kan keenya ture.
Especially his wife.	Caalaatti haadha manaa isaa.
I'm not doing anything.	Homaa hojjechaa hin jiru.
I have something to tell you.	Waan sitti himu qaba.
He will do the right thing.	Waan sirrii ta'e ni hojjeta.
They are the only ones.	Isaan kana qofa.
It’s just that he’s always with you.	Yeroo hundumaa si waliin jiraachuu isaa qofa.
He apologized again.	Ammas dhiifama gaafate.
Maybe it's my name.	Tarii maqaa koo ta'uu danda'a.
You know your place, where you belong.	Bakka kee, bakka ati kan kee akka ta'e ni beekta.
It all works out.	Hundi isaa ni hojjeta.
It was all he said.	Inni dubbate hunda ture.
So again ,	Kanaaf ammas .
I don’t even think it’s funny.	Qoosaa illee natti hin fakkaatu.
New to us.	Haaraa nuuf.
But this has never been the case.	Garuu kun akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Kana irratti wanti inni gochuu danda'u hin turre.
It was what everyone thought.	Waan namni hundi yaadu ture.
We went for it and it was for us.	Itti deemne nuuf ta'e.
It wasn't very good at the time.	Yeroo sanatti baayyee gaarii hin turre.
I am one of those people.	Ani namoota sana keessaa tokko.
Please, please, please .	Maaloo, maaloo, maaloo .
Now we only have one.	Amma tokko qofa qabna.
Better not tell anyone.	Osoo namatti hin himne wayya.
I'd rather talk about now.	Waa'ee ammaa dubbachuu naaf wayya.
Not more of the same.	Kan wal fakkaatu caalaa miti.
But you know entirely too much.	Garuu guutummaatti garmalee beekta.
You know our good name.	Maqaa gaarii keenya ni beektu.
It would be a good thing.	Waan gaarii ta'a.
They just come.	Isaan qofa dhufu.
He's already.	Isa duruu.
But neither is perfect.	Garuu lamaan isaaniiyyuu guutuu miti.
I didn’t want to know anymore.	Kana booda beekuu hin barbaanne.
Perhaps she was very good.	Tarii baayʼee ishee gaarii taʼuu dandaʼa.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
Nothing came of it.	Wanti irraa dhufe hin jiru.
It’s not like that.	Akkas miti.
Always, again.	Yeroo hundumaa, ammas.
No one asked him.	Namni isa gaafate hin turre.
With your wife.	Haadha manaa kee waliin.
That could be you.	Sun si ta'uu danda'a.
It was a simple question.	Gaaffii salphaa ture.
This was very long.	Kun baayyee dheeraa ture.
But drinking wasn’t one of them, not now.	Garuu dhugaatii isaan keessaa tokko hin turre, amma miti.
This is not working at all.	Kun tasumaa hojjechaa hin jiru.
They love him very much.	Baay'ee isa jaallatu.
One, and only one.	Tokko, fi tokko qofa.
To .	Gara .
Which he told her.	Kan inni itti hime.
But you were one .	Garuu ati tokko turte .
No one could say.	Namni jechuu hin dandeenye.
It wouldn't even have been possible.	Silaa akkas ta'uu illee hin danda'u ture.
We need to do more in our passion.	Fedhii keenya keessatti kana caalaa hojjechuu qabna.
There was a lot of stuff like that.	Wanti akkasii baay'ee ture.
You were around there.	Ati naannoo sana turte.
I will never go there again.	Kana booda gonkumaa achi hin deemu.
If this happens, nothing happens.	Yoo kun ta'e wanti ta'u hin jiru.
Just wait a few moments.	Yeroo muraasa qofa eegaa.
Maybe someone else will know.	Tarii namni biraa ni beeka ta'a.
That is not true.	Sun dhugaa miti.
No one can know what I know.	Waan ani beeku namni beekuu hin danda'u.
But this was too much even for him.	Garuu kun isaaf illee baay'ee ture.
You can’t get that from anyone else.	Sana nama biraa irraa argachuu hin dandeessu.
It could be going big.	Guddaa deemaa jiraachuu danda'a.
Which he never has, never has.	Kan inni gonkumaa hin qabne, gonkumaa hin qabu.
Next year, maybe, maybe not.	Bara dhufu, tarii, tarii hin ta'u.
But that’s a must.	Garuu sun dirqama.
What was the job.	Hojiin maal ture.
Everyone loves it.	Namni hundi ni jaallata.
I could never believe it.	Ani gonkumaa amanuu hin dandeenye.
He is the truth.	Inni dhugaa dha.
The light in him.	Ifa isa keessa jiru.
They were still good people.	Ammallee namoota gaarii turan.
But the part	Garuu kutaa .
It was really nothing more.	Dhuguma kana caalaa homaa hin turre.
I thought a lot of it was.	Baay'een isaa akkas natti fakkaate.
It didn’t happen.	Hin taane.
They were real.	Isaan dhugaa turan.
But it was her only passerby.	Garuu nama karaa irra deemu ishee qofa ture.
You just need to believe in yourself.	Ofitti amanuu qofa si barbaachisa.
This was not the night she knew.	Halkan isheen beektu kun hin turre.
But they were not locals.	Garuu namoota naannoo sanaa hin turre.
She should have known.	Isheen beekuu qabdi turte.
They are looking at it.	Itti ilaalaa jiru.
I couldn't see much.	Waan baay'ee arguu hin dandeenye.
I didn't tell you all about it.	Waa'ee isaa hunda sitti hin himne.
It was very, very wrong.	Baayyee baayyee dogoggora ture.
I didn’t know what to do here.	Asitti maal akkan godhu hin beeku ture.
. . . .	.
They are not interested.	Fedhii hin qaban malee.
That’s not his issue.	Sun dhimma isaa miti.
But we don't have much time right now.	Garuu yeroo ammaa yeroo baay'ee hin qabnu.
We would have had children.	Silaa ijoollee qabna turre.
Never in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti gonkumaa.
I still have some.	Ammallee tokko tokko qaba.
I went along with it.	Anis waliin deeme.
Maybe she has kids.	Tarii ijoollee qabdi ta'a.
I love them so much.	Ani baay'een isaan jaalladha.
You know exactly how to look for that now.	Sana akkamitti akka barbaaddu amma sirriitti beekta.
There is no reason why.	Sababni maaliif akka ta'e hin jiru.
Maybe there is no answer.	Tarii deebii hin jiru ta'a.
Bad, bad ideas.	Yaada hamaa, hamaa.
I think that's very unlikely.	Sun baay'ee hin oolu jedheen yaada.
Nothing special here.	Asitti wanti adda ta'e hin jiru.
I should be fine.	Ani gaarii ta'uu qaba.
The newcomer was one of their own.	Haaraa dhufe kan isaanii keessaa tokko ture.
It was that good.	Akkasitti gaarii ture.
Nothing more is needed.	Kana caalaa wanti hin barbaachisu.
It doesn’t sound funny.	Sagalee qoosaa hin qabu.
If not then go home.	Yoo hin taane sana booda gara manaatti deebi'i.
This must be the case.	Kun ta'uu qaba.
I hope not tonight.	Halkan kana akka hin taane abdiin qaba.
But I'm still not sure.	Garuu ammallee mirkanaa'aa miti.
That works very well.	Sun baayyee gaarii hojjeta.
But most of all, it was that night.	Hunda caalaa garuu halkan sana ture.
That was the problem this time.	Yeroo kana rakkoon isaa kanuma ture.
should have, perhaps.	qabaachuu qaba ture, tarii.
But it was a little too late.	Garuu xiqqoo booda ture.
It was great at the time.	Yeroo sanatti guddaa ture.
Even his friends.	Hiriyyoota isaa illee.
He was so funny.	Inni akkasitti qoosaa ture.
It was a lot last month.	Ji'a darbe baay'ee ture.
Obviously, things don’t have to go that way.	Wanti akkasitti deemuu akka hin qabne beekamaadha.
He went to her father.	Gara abbaa ishee deeme.
So it’s not true.	Kanaaf dhugaa miti.
I always want to stay different.	Yeroo hundumaa adda ta'ee turuu nan barbaada.
We have three.	Sadii qabna.
Almost as little about him as you do.	Waa'ee isaa akkuma keessan xiqqoo jechuun ni danda'ama.
It looks bad.	Hamaa fakkaata.
We are not like that.	Nuti akkas miti.
But there is no one else.	Namni biraa garuu hin jiru.
Then you are good to go.	Sana booda deemuuf gaarii dha.
This is not a problem.	Kun rakkoo hin qabu.
We still have enough money.	Ammas qarshii gahaa qabna.
They are not like reality.	Isaan akka dhugaa jiru miti.
I love the feel of his mouth.	Miira afaan isaa baay'een jaalladha.
Their willingness to do something.	Waan tokko hojjechuuf fedhii qabaachuu isaanii.
I think about it almost all the time.	Yeroo hunda jechuun ni danda’ama itti yaada.
But it has a name.	Garuu maqaa qaba.
He's probably a terrible accident.	Inni balaa hamaa ta'uu hin oolu.
He was a good worker.	Inni nama gaarii hojjetu ture.
Just a little bit of time.	Yeroo xiqqoo qofa.
It didn’t last long.	Yeroo dheeraa hin turre.
I am currently working on it.	Yeroo ammaa kana irratti hojjechaa jira.
It's not right.	Sirrii miti.
He knows the dangers.	Balaa isaa ni beeka.
This means that	Kana jechuun .
She was his name.	Isheen maqaa isaa turte.
I don't want to say that.	Waan akkasii dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
But it’s not his.	Garuu isaa miti.
Maybe it's both.	Tarii lamaan isaanii ta'uu danda'a.
That sounds like a lot.	Sun waan baay'ee fakkaata.
When everything was going great.	Yeroo wanti hundi guddaa ta'ee deemaa ture.
It all started about a year ago.	Hundi isaa gara waggaa tokko dura jalqabe.
For a few hours.	Sa'aatii muraasaaf.
I just don't need sleep like most people.	Akka namoota baay'ee hirriba qofa na hin barbaachisu.
I don't have it	Hin qabu .
It seems like a year ago.	Bara tokko dura fakkaata.
So I didn’t do well this time.	Kanaaf yeroo kana gaarii hin hojjenne.
Nothing can go wrong in a week.	Torban tokko keessatti wanti dogoggora ta'uu hin danda'u.
It’s certainly nothing new.	Waan haaraa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Then she had to tell the truth.	Sana booda dhugaa dubbachuu qabdi turte.
That certainly goes a long way.	Sun karaa dheeraa akka deemu beekamaadha.
Like always being on the road.	Akka yeroo hunda karaa irra jiraachuu.
You can’t live there now.	Amma achi jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
It doesn’t work like that though.	Akkasitti hin hojjetu garuu.
I still think of you.	Ammallee si yaada.
On both works.	Hojii lamaan irratti.
He has a job.	Hojii qaba.
They are ours.	Isaan kan keenya.
I was the lucky one.	Ani kan carraa qabu ture.
But he doesn't have it.	Garuu hin qabu.
I know that much about him.	Waa'ee isaa hangas beeka.
I really don't want to be alone right now.	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kophaa ta'uu hin barbaadu.
But it hasn’t happened yet.	Garuu hanga ammaatti hin taane.
That’s when something hit me.	Yeroo sanatti wanti tokko natti dhufe.
I looked at him.	jedheen ilaale.
I was very pleased with myself.	Ofitti baay'een gammade.
It's an hour ago.	Sa'aatii tokko dura jira.
That’s a must.	Sun dirqama.
It makes fun of me.	Itti natti qoosaa.
I'm not about that.	Ani waa'ee sanaa miti.
It was an hour later in the morning.	Ganama sa'aatii tokko booda ture.
They were watching his work.	Hojii isaa ilaalaa turan.
I just didn’t realize it at the time.	Yeroo sanatti qofa hin hubanne ture.
We have enough money.	Maallaqa gahaa qabna.
It shouldn't exist.	Jiraachuu hin qabu.
The work is good.	Hojiin gaarii dha.
You can leave me here.	Asitti na dhiisuu dandeessu.
I think this works for me.	Kun waan naaf hojjetu natti fakkaata.
So I was happy for him.	Kanaaf isaaf gammade.
All he does is scream.	Wanti inni godhu iyyuu qofa.
It’s a different job than the one that went before.	Kan kanaan dura deeme irraa hojii adda.
But this is what usually happens.	Garuu yeroo baay'ee kan ta'u kana.
But it’s not a good one.	Garuu kan gaarii miti.
I know him a little bit.	Xiqqoo isa beeka.
Very, very good.	Baay'ee, baay'ee gaarii.
The problem here is not your diet.	Rakkoon asitti jiru nyaata kee miti.
They are going tomorrow.	Boru deemaa jiru.
That seems pretty simple.	Sun baayyee salphaa fakkaata.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Homaa gochuu hin barbaanne.
That’s really not a long time at all.	Sun dhuguma yeroo dheeraa miti tasumaa.
What does it do? 	Maal godha?
Why is that???.	Maaliif akkas ta'e???.
I can't leave you.	Si dhiisuu hin danda'u.
This doesn’t seem like a big deal.	Kun waan guddaa hin fakkaatu.
I 'm so sorry	Baay'een dhiifama .
That's why it happened.	Kanaaf ta'e.
It was one of many.	Hedduu keessaa tokko ture.
I just can't see it.	Ani qofa arguu hin danda'u.
I don’t have time.	Yeroo hin qabu.
You have to fill this.	Kana guutuu qabda.
I just didn't think it would happen so soon.	Dafee akkas ta'a jedhee hin yaadne qofa.
You have nothing.	Ati homaa hin qabdu.
He cares for us.	Inni nuuf yaada.
But this is with everything.	Garuu kun waan hundumaa wajjin jira.
Everything is in it.	Wanti hundi keessa jira.
Maybe it's a book.	Tarii kitaaba ta'uu danda'a.
He had to know that they were like him.	Isaan akka isaa taʼuu isaanii beekuu qaba ture.
It was for a long time.	Yeroo dheeraaf ture.
It never happened before.	Duraan akkas ta'ee hin beeku.
It was a good thing.	Waan gaarii ture.
But we don't do that.	Nuti garuu kana hin goonu.
In this case, that's not very helpful.	Haala kana keessatti, sun baayyee hin gargaaru.
But it is not like that.	Garuu akkas miti.
We understood.	Nuti hubanne.
I loved everyone.	Nama hunda nan jaalladha ture.
Just my opinion.	Yaada koo qofa.
There were a lot of people around the old house.	Naannoo mana durii sanaa namoonni baay'een turan.
This is really something.	Kun dhuguma waan tokko.
They didn’t have it before.	Kanaan dura hin qaban turan.
He had a big problem.	Rakkoo guddaa qaba ture.
I thought it would really work.	Dhuguma ni hojjeta jedheen yaade.
But not tonight.	Garuu halkan kana miti.
I'm sure I'm sorry about that.	Waa'ee sanaa dhiifama akkan qabu mirkanaa'adha.
Who were together, right together.	Kan waliin turan, sirriitti waliin turan.
But it still wasn’t perfect.	Garuu ammallee guutuu hin turre.
That doesn't do that.	Jechuun akkas hin godhu.
But only part of it.	Garuu kutaa isaa qofa.
The reason, I think, is obvious.	Sababni isaa, natti fakkaata, ifaadha.
Didn't see it happen.	Akka ta'u hin argine.
They say that.	Akkas jedhu.
We are working together.	Waliin hojjechaa jirra.
I want to buy from them.	Isaan irraa bitachuu barbaada.
This wouldn't be so bad.	Kun hangas hamaa hin ta'u ture.
You know my work.	Hojii koo beekta.
I can't tell you any more.	Kana caalaa sitti himuu hin danda'u.
And it didn’t happen again.	Ammas hin taane.
Lots of drinking.	Dhugaatii baay'ee.
We saw a few people.	Namoota muraasa argine.
Something more important.	Waan caalaa barbaachisaa ta'e.
It just seemed like the right time.	Yeroo sirrii ta'e qofa fakkaata ture.
It was genuine curiosity.	Fedhii beekuu dhugaa ture.
Not a little bit.	Xiqqoo miti.
We had this yesterday.	Kana kaleessa qabna turre.
I didn't mean to be like that.	Ani akkas ta'uuf hin yaadne.
It was the sound of your voice.	Sagalee sagalee kee ture.
The timing wasn’t perfect.	Yeroon sun guutuu hin turre.
But it shouldn't be like that.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
Very, very soon.	Baayyee baayyee yeroo dhiyootti.
What, she didn’t know.	Maal, isheen hin beektu turte.
They would be here two days.	Silaa guyyaa lama as ta'u.
I can't say more than that.	Kana caalaa jechuu hin danda'u.
I can’t quit yet.	Ammas dhiisuu hin danda’u.
Now it is obvious.	Amma beekamaadha.
Then it will be fine.	Sana booda gaarii ta'a.
He was pretty good before.	Kanaan dura baayyee gaarii ture.
I 'm not sure	Ani kana .
He just wants to see you.	Inni si arguu qofa barbaada.
I hope you are doing well.	Akka gaariitti akka jirtu abdiin qaba.
But it was still a mistake.	Garuu ammas dogoggora ture.
I think they are pretty great.	Isaan baayyee guddaa natti fakkaata.
Most people mean something very different.	Namoonni baay’een jechuun waan baay’ee adda ta’e jechuu dha.
She just didn't last very long.	Isheen baay'ee hin turre qofa.
That night, none.	Halkan sana, tokkollee hin jiru.
Nothing happened for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti ta'e hin jiru.
She really had eyes.	Dhuguma ija qabdi turte.
He had to stay there.	Achi turuu qaba ture.
It works a lot.	Baay'ee hojjeta.
I really really do.	Dhuguma dhuguma nan godha.
It’s not always the right answer.	Yeroo hunda deebii sirrii miti.
He doesn't need it.	Isa hin barbaachisu.
It’s not a joke.	Qoosaa miti.
Then he went out again.	Sana booda ammas ba'e.
It was a really great time.	Yeroon sun dhuguma yeroo guddaa ture.
I just can't be like that.	Ani akkas ta'uu hin danda'u qofa.
I still can’t really believe it.	Ammallee dhuguma amanuu hin dandeenye.
I wanted to play more.	Caalaatti taphachuu barbaade.
We all need that to happen.	Hundi keenya wanti akkasii akka ta'u qabna.
They need it a lot.	Baay'ee isaan barbaachisa.
I'm just me.	Ani ana qofa.
It's still not right.	Ammas sirrii miti.
It was like everything else.	Akkuma waan hundumaa ture.
There was still time though.	Ammas yeroon jira ture garuu.
He was only three years old.	Umuriin isaa sadii qofa ture.
I couldn’t leave him alone.	Kophaa isaa dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
Serious problems.	Rakkoo hamaa.
But that was all they had.	Garuu isaan qaban kana qofa ture.
He didn’t have like any issues.	Inni akka dhimma tokkollee hin qabu ture.
They are all in the same area.	Hundi isaanii naannoo tokko keessa jiru.
That wasn’t entirely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa hin turre.
That there is no such thing.	Kan akka hin jirre.
It didn't matter what the reason was.	Sababni isaa maal akka ta'e garuu homaa hin turre.
We need to respond to this.	Kanaaf deebii kennuu qabna.
Nothing would work.	Wanti tokkollee hin hojjetu ture.
Sorry about that .	Dhiifama waa'ee sanaa .
He was dangerous.	Inni balaa qaba ture.
I couldn't stay here.	As turuu hin dandeenye.
Now he was going.	Amma deemaa ture.
It really just works.	Dhuguma qofa hojjeta.
We have to do that.	Sana gochuu qabna.
As always.	Akkuma yeroo hundumaa.
It’s been on for two years.	Waggaa lama irra jira.
I mean, of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha jechuu kooti.
But, he couldn’t do it.	Garuu, gochuu hin dandeenye.
He has nothing.	Inni homaa hin qabu.
That was a really long time ago.	Sun dhuguma yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
I’m in school, you know.	Ani mana barumsaa jira, beektaa.
I know, that everything that happened happened.	Ani beeka, wanti ta'e hundi akka ta'e.
But someone had to do it.	Garuu namni tokko gochuu qaba ture.
All she did was sleep.	Wanti isheen goote hirriba qofa ture.
But he still thought he was wrong.	Garuu ammas dogoggora akka qabu itti fakkaate.
To help with homework.	Hojii manaa gargaaruuf.
You know that part.	Kutaa sana ni beekta.
You don’t have to do something.	Waan tokko gochuun dirqama miti.
He was a man of the house.	Nama manaa ture.
But he thought he knew.	Garuu waan beeku itti fakkaate.
I never understood why.	Maaliif akka ta'e gonkumaa hin hubanne.
It's not a retreat.	Duubatti deebi'uu miti.
This doesn't seem right.	Kun sirrii hin fakkaatu.
No one had to do it.	Namni tokkollee gochuu hin qabu ture.
It can be a lot of things.	Waan baay’ee ta’uu danda’a.
That's how it happened.	Akkas ta'e.
But they are not.	Garuu isaan miti.
He should have known better.	Kana caalaa beekuu qaba ture.
It just seems ridiculous.	Qoosaa qofa fakkaata.
But that's about it all.	Garuu waa'ee hundumaa kanuma.
I can't eat them.	Isaan nyaachuu hin danda'u.
We looked for each other.	Wal barbaanne.
A few suggestions.	Yaada muraasa.
He told her something was dangerous.	Wanti tokko balaa akka qabu itti hime.
You can do two.	Lama gochuu dandeessa.
That was a mistake.	Sun dogoggora ture.
It will be way too easy.	Karaa baayyee salphaa ta'a.
Of course I did.	Akkan godhe beekamaadha.
I didn't want to ask.	Gaafachuu hin barbaanne.
But he still has his.	Garuu ammallee kan isaa qaba.
He should know better.	Caalaatti beekuu qaba.
He was the boy in my class.	Inni kutaa koo keessatti gurbaa ture.
She’s right, obviously.	Isheen sirrii dha, ifaadha.
He didn't think of anything.	Homaa hin yaadne.
You are here to stay.	Ati turuuf as jirta.
Took the long way home.	Karaa dheeraa gara manaatti fudhate.
No one wants to live there.	Namni achi jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
It wasn’t even work with her.	Ishee waliin hojii illee hin turre.
He hardly knows he's on it.	Inni akka irra jiru baay'ee hin beeku.
But that’s the only reason.	Garuu sababni isaa kana qofa.
He needs a drink.	Dhugaatii isa barbaachisa.
Of course, I couldn’t speak.	Dubbachuu akkan hin dandeenye beekamaadha.
But, we should not go back that far.	Garuu, hanga sana duubatti deebi'uu hin qabnu.
It was very much like that.	Baay'ee akkas ture.
He tried again	Ammas yaale .
They just do work.	Hojii hojii qofa hojjetu.
But he says he has no chance.	Garuu carraa hin qabu jedha.
No one was looking at him.	Namni isa ilaalaa hin turre.
That’s your time.	Yeroon kee sun.
I really didn’t know what to make of it.	Dhuguma maal akkan itti godhu hin beeku ture.
This is dangerous for you.	Kun siif balaa dha.
Everything was like that .	Wanti hundi akkas ture .
Maybe we should do it.	Tarii nuti gochuu qabna ta'a.
We were all in on the joke.	Hundi keenya qoosaa sana keessa turre.
They know his full name.	Maqaa isaa guutuu ni beeku.
She doesn’t look bad.	Isheen hamaa hin fakkaattu.
I didn’t want to believe him.	Isa amanuu hin barbaanne.
I thought you would love to see me inside.	Keessatti na arguu ni jaallattu jedheen yaade.
I need help, father.	Gargaarsa na barbaachisa abbaa.
I saw him play a lot.	Baay'ee taphachuu isaa arge.
Usually all of those things.	Yeroo baayyee wantoota sana hunda.
But there was no one.	Garuu namni hin turre.
Clearly, that was her problem.	Rakkoon ishee kanuma akka ture ifaadha.
Maybe it's both.	Tarii lamaan isaanii ta'uu danda'a.
The reason was simple.	Sababni isaa salphaa ture.
I won't say more.	Kana caalaa hin jedhu.
Everyone could go home.	Namni hundi gara manaatti deebi'uu danda'a ture.
It’s not a picture.	Suuraa miti.
So good luck!.	Kanaaf carraa gaarii!.
His prospects were excellent.	Abdiin isaa baayyee gaarii ture.
I saw no other way.	Karaa biraa hin argine.
I have no other idea.	Yaada biraa hin qabu.
And that’s not all.	Kana qofa miti.
I don’t have food.	Nyaata hin qabu.
Look at the facts.	Dhugaa jiru ilaalaa.
We need to work together.	Waliin hojjechuu qabna.
But this doesn’t seem right.	Garuu kun sirrii hin fakkaatu.
Everything about them is different.	Waa'ee isaanii wanti hundi adda adda.
It wasn’t a good night.	Halkan gaarii hin turre.
This couldn’t happen.	Kun ta’uu hin dandeenye.
I'm not going to be.	Ani garuu hin ta'u.
I saw her twice.	Yeroo lama ishee arge.
What, who knows.	Maal, eenyutu beeka.
But this should never have happened.	Garuu kun gonkumaa ta’uu hin qabu ture.
That’s just me.	Sun ana qofa.
Like everyone else.	Akkuma nama hundumaa.
But not anymore.	Garuu kana booda miti.
But mostly his children.	Garuu irra caalaa ijoollee isaa.
More, even.	Caalaatti, illee.
He wants to believe he can help her.	Ishee gargaaruu akka danda'u amanuu barbaada.
He didn't say anything to her.	Homaa itti hin dubbanne.
That was another one of my mistakes.	Sun dogoggora koo keessaa kan biraa ture.
It doesn’t work yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin hojjetu.
Not many of us.	Baay'ee keenya miti.
I certainly don’t think so.	Ani akkas akkan hin yaadne beekamaadha.
You know what you need to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu ni beekta.
That was a long time ago, of course.	Sun yeroo dheeraa dura akka ta’e beekamaadha.
I am one of his eyes.	Ani ija isaa tokko.
He’s really doing a great job.	Dhuguma hojii guddaa hojjechaa jira.
There was nothing there.	Achitti wanti tokkollee hin turre.
But he wasn't here.	Garuu as hin turre.
The name of his wife.	Maqaa haadha manaa isaa.
She never knew her father.	Abbaa ishee gonkumaa hin beektu turte.
Being alone doesn’t mean being in nothing.	Kophaa jiraachuu jechuun homaa keessa jiraachuu jechuu miti.
But we have a big problem.	Garuu rakkoo guddaa qabna.
I still think that’s true.	Ammallee sun dhugaa natti fakkaata.
Why are you still here?.	Ammas maaliif as jirta?.
Think of someone like that.	Nama akkasii yaadu.
This can't be good.	Kun gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u.
I hadn’t, with her.	Ani hin qabu ture, ishee waliin.
It is more important than that.	Kana caalaa barbaachisaa dha.
She was rarely alone at parties.	Affeerraa irratti yeroo muraasa qofa kophaa ishee turte.
That’s just his sense of humor.	Sun miira qoosaa isaa qofa.
This time, it’s okay.	Yeroo kana, homaa miti.
She couldn't	Isheen hin dandeenye .
I have been before.	Ani kanaan dura ture.
He always knew what she was thinking.	Yeroo hundumaa waan isheen yaaddu ni beeka ture.
This told me something.	Kun waan tokko natti hime.
Like the boy.	Akkuma gurbaa.
Go with me to the new ones.	Gara warra haaraa na waliin deemaa.
You are the only person you can forgive.	Nama dhiifama gochuu dandeessu si qofa.
I really didn’t want anything.	Dhuguma homaa hin barbaanne.
Maybe you didn't know there was such a problem.	Tarii rakkoon akkasii akka jiru hin beektu ta'a.
They still have it.	Ammas qabu.
I know, kidding .	Ani beeka, qoosaa .
Maybe you didn't have time .	Tarii yeroo hin qabdu turte ta'a .
Work, work.	Hojii, hojii.
I couldn’t have that.	Sana qabaachuu hin dandeenye.
A good man.	Nama gaarii.
Look at my hands.	Harka koo ilaalaa.
The opportunity to eat something new was fantastic.	Carraan waan haaraa nyaachuu baay'ee namatti tola ture.
I think it would have been.	Silaa ta'a jedheen yaada.
She doesn’t need to.	Isheen hin barbaachisu.
He doesn’t like living here.	As jiraachuu hin jaallatu.
It was all a long time ago.	Hundi isaa yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
None of them knew about it.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee waa’ee kanaa hin beeku ture.
But the wife	Garuu haadha manaa .
But it doesn't happen.	Garuu hin ta'u.
I don’t like them at all.	Ani tasumaa isaan hin jaalladhu.
It was never too late.	Gonkumaa yeroon booda hin turre.
I know it was good.	Gaarii akka ture nan beeka.
But now everything works great.	Amma garuu wanti hundi guddaa hojjeta.
It was a great thing.	Waan guddaa ture.
I couldn't say why.	Maaliif jechuu hin dandeenye.
I 'm just	Ani qofa .
She didn’t know what he was thinking.	Waan inni yaadu hin beektu turte.
I had no idea what it was.	Maal akka ta'e yaada hin qabu ture.
We need to know what happened there.	Waan achitti ta'e beekuu qabna.
We have, we have	Qabna, qabna .
You can't.	Hin dandeessu.
Everything you need to do.	Waan gochuu qabdu hunda.
This was two nights ago.	Kun halkan lama dura ture.
Sorry, can't help you there.	Dhiifama, achitti si gargaaruu hin danda'u.
Just some guys.	Gurbaa tokko tokko qofa.
Nothing else is going to work there.	Wanti biraa achitti hojjechuuf deemu hin jiru.
He gave a little.	Xiqqoo kenne.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Waan barbaade hunda gochuu dandaʼa ture.
It should have been me.	Silaa ana ta'uu qaba ture.
I think there is nothing special about this.	Kana keessa wanti adda ta'e waan hin jirre natti fakkaata.
I want to get feedback.	Yaada argachuu nan barbaada.
He got a job.	Hojii argate.
It all seems so simple at the time.	Hundi isaa yeroo sanatti baayyee salphaa fakkaata.
This one, however, is very different.	Inni kun garuu baayyee adda.
That job does that to you.	Hojiin sun akkas si godha.
It has a great sound.	Sagalee guddaa qaba.
It was completely missed.	Guutummaatti kan darbe ture.
But who can say.	Garuu eenyutu jechuu danda'a.
Except there were two of them.	Isaan keessaa lama turan malee.
Maybe you can buy something.	Tarii waan tokko bitachuu dandeessu.
It was a good year!.	Bara gaarii ture!.
Except it's probably for you.	Siif ta'uu hin oolu malee.
I doubt it ever will.	Yoomiyyuu ta'uu isaa nan shakka.
He did what he came to do.	Waan hojjechuuf dhufe hojjete.
We had to ask.	Gaafachuu qabna turre.
That was then, this is now.	Sun yeroo sana ture, kun amma.
But, it’s not what you think.	Garuu, waan ati yaaddu miti.
But, it didn’t.	Garuu, hin taane.
You know he meant what he said.	Waan jedhe jechuu isaa beekta.
Except for my clothes.	Uffata koo malee.
Yelling at your shoes.	Kophee kee irratti iyyuu.
That you do it once.	Yeroo tokko akka gootu.
But if that's the way it's going to be, then that's the way it should be.	Garuu yoo akkas ta'u ta'e akkas ta'uu qaba.
That was once a lot.	Sun yeroo tokko baayʼee ture.
I can't see the way.	Karaa arguu hin danda'u.
I want to know if it could be an issue.	Dhimma ta'uu akka danda'u beekuu barbaada.
That wasn’t true.	Sun dhugaa hin turre.
You are my daughter, now.	Ati intala kooti, ​​amma.
I need someone here.	Asitti nama na barbaachisa.
They were very good to me.	Isaan baayyee naaf gaarii turan.
He found his way.	Karaa isaa argate.
That was what we meant.	Wanti nuti jechuu barbaanne akkas ture.
You know what’s inside you.	Waan keessa kee jiru ni beekta.
I need say no more.	Kana caalaa hin jechuun na barbaachisa.
But only last year.	Garuu bara darbe qofa.
If not.	Yoo miti.
That she was waiting for him.	Akka isheen isa eegaa turte.
About being older.	Waa'ee umuriin isaa guddaa ta'uu.
That’s not what made her bad.	Kan ishee hamaa godhe sana miti.
But they say they are doing more.	Garuu kana caalaa hojjechaa jirra jedhu.
He won’t need any of this any time soon.	Yeroo dhiyootti kana keessaa tokkollee isa hin barbaachisu.
Look at him today.	Har'a isa ilaalaa.
It was there at the time.	Yeroo sanatti ni ture.
But it came.	Garuu dhufe.
Not someone else.	Nama biraa miti.
It didn’t work that way.	Akkasitti hin hojjenne.
Her work is not good.	Hojiin ishee gaarii miti.
Now they were old friends.	Amma hiriyyoota durii turan.
He knew it wasn't.	Hin turre ni beeka ture.
They love it.	Isaan ni jaallatu.
What did I think.	Maal jedheen yaade.
That’s how we did it.	Akkasitti hojjenne.
She has no answer.	Deebii hin qabdu.
I intend to do so tomorrow.	Boru akkas gochuuf yaada.
There would have been nothing.	Silaa homaa hin jiru ture.
That’s just fine.	Sun gaarii qofa.
As .	Akka .
It could have been him.	Silaa isa ta'uu danda'a ture.
He wants to be a father.	Abbaa ta'uu barbaada.
You can do better than that.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandeessa.
They were his friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota isaa turan.
I couldn’t see anything inside.	Keessatti homaa arguu hin dandeenye.
Where are you?.	Eessa jirta?.
No one wants that to happen.	Namni akkas akka ta'u barbaadu hin jiru.
Day and night.	Guyyaa fi guyyaa.
He was a man of interest.	Inni nama fedhii qabu ture.
Clearly, that is not what happened.	Wanti taʼe akkas akka hin taane ifaadha.
Then came the opportunity for disaster.	Sana booda carraan balaa dhufe.
But that was in the past.	Garuu sun yeroo darbe ture.
You should have seen me before.	Silaa kanaan dura na arguu qabda turte.
More familiar, really.	Caalaatti nama beeku, dhuguma.
Ideas of what is not.	Yaada waan hin taane.
Some people need to go to the hospital.	Namoonni tokko tokko mana yaalaa deemuun isaan barbaachisa.
It was really nice.	Dhuguma namatti tola ture.
She doesn't have anything good.	Isheen waan gaarii hin qabdu.
It does absolutely nothing else.	Tasumaa waan biraa hin hojjetu.
He seemed very happy.	Inni baay'ee gammade fakkaata ture.
I'm sure she's right.	Isheen sirrii akka taate mirkanaa'adha.
That's how you should be .	Akkas ta'uu qabda .
This is just a very good book.	Kun kitaaba baayyee gaarii qofa.
They had too much.	Garmalee qaban turan.
You can still see what is happening.	Ammas waan ta'aa jiru arguu dandeessu.
I have theirs.	Kan isaanii qaba.
To help me out.	Na gargaaruuf.
But still a dog.	Garuu ammas saree.
You were there.	Ati achi turte.
I couldn’t help but do that.	Akkas gochuu dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
But a few of them.	Isaan keessaa garuu muraasa.
But there is a reason.	Garuu sababni jira.
It was finding her father.	Abbaa ishee argachuu ture.
You could do something else without them.	Osoo isaan hin taane waan biraa hojjechuu dandeessa.
But you know she loves you more than anything.	Garuu waan hundumaa caalaa akka si jaallattu beekta.
Everything about him seemed so contained.	Waa'ee isaa wanti hundi akkasitti kan of keessaa qabu fakkaata ture.
Go back in there.	Achi keessa deebi'i.
We should have gotten this three years ago.	Kana waggaa sadii dura argachuu qabna turre.
Something like that may indeed be true.	Wanti akkasii dhuguma dhugaa ta’uu danda’a.
He is now in good shape.	Amma haala gaarii irra jira.
It is not necessary.	Hin barbaachisu.
They shouldn't be like that.	Isaan akkas ta'uu hin qaban.
Maybe they're all friends already.	Tarii duruu hundi isaanii hiriyyoota ta'uu danda'a.
My only problem is.	Rakkoon koo qofa.
I didn’t do that.	Ani akkas hin goone.
But not so soon.	Garuu akkas dafee miti.
She’s not the only one.	Ishee qofa miti.
Now it had become a big deal.	Amma waan guddaa ta'ee ture.
We were in it.	Nuti keessa turre.
It is absolutely correct.	Guutummaatti sirrii dha.
No one can help anyone.	Namni tokkollee nama gargaaruu hin danda'u.
You have a name.	Maqaa qabda.
I didn't know why.	Maaliif akka ta'e hin beekne.
Perhaps it was the money.	Tarii maallaqa sana taʼuu dandaʼa.
It was not an easy task.	Hojii salphaa hin turre.
John, that was me.	Yohaannis, sun ana ture.
But he saw that it could not be.	Garuu ta'uu akka hin dandeenye arge.
This is our desire.	Kun fedhii keenya.
If not, there would be problems.	Osoo hin taane rakkoon ni jiraata ture.
Never needed it, until now.	Gonkumaa hin barbaachifne, hanga ammaatti.
He did more of his thing.	Inni waan isaa caalaa godhe.
I wanted to buy him a hat.	Kophee isaaf bitachuu barbaade.
Perhaps that is the problem.	Tarii rakkoon sun kanuma taʼuu dandaʼa.
He started there as a new teacher.	Barsiisaa haaraa ta'ee achitti jalqabe.
He can do it if he wants to.	Yoo barbaade hojjechuu danda'a.
Stepping back for a moment.	Yeroo muraasaaf duubatti deebi'uu.
We are currently looking into this matter.	Yeroo ammaa dhimma kana ilaalaa jirra.
I started screaming.	Anis iyyuu jalqabe.
Like how that you.	Akka akkamitti akka ati.
I saw no one there.	Achitti nama tokkollee hin argine.
No one here knows how it works.	Namni asitti akkamitti akka hojjetu beeku hin jiru.
But he doesn't have it.	Garuu hin qabu.
I have work in the morning.	Ganama hojiin qaba.
That's how it could work.	Akkasitti hojjechuu danda'a ture.
That she was.	Akka isheen turte.
He was the man he was.	Inni nama akka ture ture.
None of them were doing that.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee akkas gochaa hin turre.
I can say that.	Kana jechuu nan danda'a.
There was no reason.	Sababni hin turre.
It was just in him, that was all.	Isa keessa qofa ture, kana qofa ture.
In the broad.	Bal'aa keessatti.
We were the only ones.	Nuti qofa turre.
Everyone wants answers.	Namni hundi deebii barbaada.
But it looks good.	Garuu gaarii fakkaata.
It's just what we're supposed to be.	Waan ta'uu qabnu qofa.
You have to stay on it.	Irratti turuu qabda.
There will always be work.	Hojiin yeroo hundumaa ni jiraata.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
Still, it seemed like a good idea.	Ammas yaada gaarii fakkaata ture.
Once he came to my room .	Yeroo tokko kutaa kootti dhufe .
This was a mistake.	Kun dogoggora ture.
He realized it wouldn’t be long.	Yeroo dheeraa akka hin taane hubate.
There’s just nothing there.	Achitti wanti tokkollee hin jiru qofa.
I want to know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e beekuu barbaada.
I think it must be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
Something we can do.	Waan tokko gochuu dandeenyu.
I have no problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoo tokkollee hin qabu.
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.	Akka hin taane mirkanaa'aa dha.
I need to go.	Deemuun na barbaachisa.
A lot of people didn't.	Namoonni baay'een hin goone.
But you have to give me something here.	Garuu asitti waan tokko naaf kennuu qabda.
I don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
It involved a lot of work.	Hojii guddaa kan of keessaa qabu ture.
He knew he could never go back.	Yoomiyyuu duubatti deebi'uu akka hin dandeenye beeka ture.
Nothing matters in that situation.	Haala sana keessatti wanti barbaachisaa ta’e hin jiru.
But he rarely came up.	Garuu yeroo muraasaaf ol dhufe.
She was on to something.	Waan tokko irra turte.
It worked out.	Ni hojjete.
It's unclear what happened after that.	Sana booda maaltu ta'e ifa miti.
They all say the same thing.	Hundi isaanii kanuma jedhu.
She did so much for me.	Waan baay'ee naaf goote.
As .	Akka .
This person has issues just like you.	Namni kun dhimma akkuma kee qaba.
How can it be different.	Akkamitti adda ta'uu danda'a.
I didn’t know what to do with myself.	Waan ofitti godhu hin beeku ture.
I was late too.	Anis yeroon booda ture.
Now we need to get that.	Amma sana argachuu qabna.
I didn’t just go one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa hin deemne.
It couldn't have been good.	Gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
This is not true.	Kun dhugaa miti.
I didn’t think about it.	Hin yaadne.
But he just can’t seem to do it.	Garuu waan gochuu hin dandeenye qofa fakkaata.
This was not easy.	Kun salphaa hin turre.
It was necessary.	Barbaachisaa ture.
No one is kidding themselves.	Namni ofitti qoosaa jiru hin jiru.
I can still get it.	Ammallee argachuu danda'a.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Akkamitti akkan godhu qofa hin beeku.
He came to help.	Gargaaruuf dhufe.
You really don't understand.	Dhuguma siif hin galle.
I saw you there one night.	Halkan tokko achitti si arge.
This didn't do anything.	Kun homaa hin goone.
He doesn't exist now.	Amma hin jiru.
Still so much to do and so little time.	Ammas waan baay'ee hojjechuu fi yeroo xiqqoo.
Who cares about it? 	Eenyutu dhimma qaba?
. . . .	.
One of them knows.	Isaan keessaa tokko ni beeka.
Nothing about my guy.	Waa'ee gurbaa koo homaa miti.
That was all it was.	Kana qofa ture.
This is a sound.	Kun sagalee dha.
That was one of them.	Sun tokko ture.
He should have done better.	Silaa isa caalaa hojjechuu qaba ture.
Not one.	Tokko miti.
Not that he absolutely had to.	Inni guutummaatti dirqama ta'uu qaba ture jechuu miti.
I need it.	Na barbaachisa.
He looked fine.	Inni gaarii fakkaata ture.
She was all that was needed.	Isheen waan barbaachisu hunda turte.
He lives with his father.	Abbaa isaa waliin jiraata.
Not alone, alone.	Kophaa miti, kophaa.
It didn't matter.	Dhimma hin qabu ture.
I think that’s important.	Sun barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
We all worked together.	Hundi keenya waliin hojjenne.
It was becoming a problem.	Rakkoo ta'aa ture.
Maybe not her father.	Tarii abbaa ishee miti ta'a.
As they say later.	Akkuma booda jedhu.
There was nothing similar before.	Kanaan dura wanti wal fakkaatu hin turre.
A plain old car crash.	Balaa konkolaataa durii ifa ta'e.
It was a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee ture.
You, with me.	Ati, na waliin.
It is not such a book.	Kitaaba akkasii miti.
But much of what he said was absolutely right.	Garuu wanti inni dubbate baay’een isaa guutummaatti sirrii ture.
As you said.	Akkuma jette.
But she wasn't.	Isheen garuu hin turre.
Maybe it's too much.	Tarii garmalee ta'uu danda'a.
It must have a voice.	Sagalee qabaachuu qaba.
Let's see why this is.	Mee ilaalaa kana maaliif.
It can help you.	Si gargaaruu dandaʼa.
It was ahead of its time.	Yeroo isaa dura ture.
I don’t know his full name.	Maqaa isaa guutuu hin beeku.
They had money.	Maallaqa qaban turan.
This time he got lucky.	Yeroo kana carraa argate.
You can’t just say that.	Akkas jechuu qofa hin dandeessu.
They have their own.	Ofii isaanii qabu.
I think it was yesterday.	Kaleessa natti fakkaata.
I highly doubt this.	Kana baay'een shakka.
I think it should work so well.	Akkasitti akka gaariitti hojjechuu qaba jedheen yaada.
Very big and too big for me.	Baayyee guddaa fi naaf baayyee guddaa dha.
No excuse, except myself.	Sababa hin qabu, ofii koo malee.
They were all there.	Hundi isaanii achi turan.
Please, please go.	Maaloo, mee deemaa.
The problem is	Rakkoon jiru .
It wasn’t yesterday.	Kaleessa hin turre.
I don't know what he meant by that.	Kana jechuun maal jechuu akka barbaade hin beeku.
Probably her teacher.	Tarii barsiisaa ishee ta'uu hin oolu.
Even my husband sometimes.	Abbaa manaa koo illee yeroo tokko tokko.
This was not her accident.	Kun balaa ishee hin turre.
With everyone.	Nama hunda waliin.
In this case.	Haala kana keessatti.
It may already be too late.	Duraan yeroon booda ta'uu danda'a.
I loved my dog.	Saree koo nan jaalladha ture.
Please tell me.	Mee natti himi.
Three boys, one girl.	Gurbaa sadii, intala tokko.
It’s working well for us so far.	Hanga ammaatti akka gaariitti nuuf hojjechaa jira.
It wasn’t a boy’s room.	Kutaa gurbaa hin turre.
But it’s not right.	Garuu sirrii miti.
That was always the case at night.	Halkan yeroo hunda kanuma ture.
There isn’t that much.	Hamma sana hin jiru.
Something different was happening with you.	Waan adda ta'e tokko si waliin ta'aa ture.
None of them are good.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee gaarii miti.
Wait, we already are.	Eegaa, nuti duruu jirra.
He has a lot of work to do.	Hojii baay'ee qaba.
I would never have gone to a place like that.	Silaa bakka akkasii gonkumaa hin deemu ture.
One came for him.	Tokko isaaf dhufe.
But he was here.	Inni garuu as ture.
None of that works.	Sana keessaa tokkollee hin hojjetu.
Life in the room.	Jireenya kutaa.
Which is making fun of me.	Kan na qoosaa jiru.
But you were looking up there.	Ati garuu achi ol barbaadaa turte.
Today will be different.	Har'a adda ta'a.
You need help, we’re here.	Gargaarsa si barbaachisa, as jirra.
He is not alone.	Inni kophaa isaa miti.
The problem is, there are very few of them.	Rakkoon jiru, isaan keessaa baayyee muraasa.
You need to have a home.	Mana qabaachuu barbaachisa.
None of them really matter.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee dhuguma dhimma hin qabu.
No one seems interested.	Namni fedhii qabu hin fakkaatu.
He has a bad mouth.	Afaan hamaa qaba.
The only problem is it’s not true.	Rakkoon jiru dhugaa miti qofa.
What happened is not about you.	Wanti ta'e waa'ee kee miti.
It may not be the case.	Akkas ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
Then another day.	Sana booda guyyaa biraa.
Most of the time.	Yeroo baay'ee.
They are all together all the time.	Hundi isaanii yeroo hunda waliin jiru.
We’re looking great.	Guddaa fakkaataa jirra.
Sometimes he was amused.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni qoosaa ture.
Not so this time.	Yeroo kana akkas miti.
But she isn’t like that.	Garuu isheen akkas miti.
They don’t need that much.	Isaan hanga sana hin barbaachisu.
It was perhaps the only question that seemed important.	Tarii gaaffii barbaachisaa fakkaatu isa qofa ture.
He is very well known.	Inni baay'ee beekamaadha.
But it is not necessary.	Garuu dirqama miti.
It’s really no big deal.	Dhuguma waan guddaa miti.
If it is absolutely irrelevant for no other reason.	Yoo sababa biraa malee guutummaatti barbaachisaa hin taane.
I had two things going for me.	Waan lama naaf deemaa ture.
But this is not an easy road.	Garuu kun karaa salphaa miti.
Maybe, but maybe not.	Tarii, garuu tarii hin ta'u.
That should have been hours ago.	Sun sa'aatii dura ta'uu qaba ture.
Some people like it.	Namoonni tokko tokko ni jaallatu.
You didn’t speak and no one told us.	Ati hin dubbanne namni nutti hime hin jiru.
Maybe this is a joke.	Tarii kun qoosaa ta'uu danda'a.
It can't be true.	Dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Even this one.	Inni kun illee.
We were the same age.	Umuriin keenya tokko turre.
None of them thought this was true.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee kun dhugaa taʼuu isaa hin yaadne.
But that’s just me.	Garuu sun ana qofa.
There was little he could see.	Wanti arguu danda'u xiqqoo ture.
So far, none can.	Hanga ammaatti tokkollee hin danda'u.
You know, but it’s my job.	Beektaa garuu hojii kooti.
That seems to be about it.	Sun waa'ee isaa waan ta'e fakkaata.
I just think it does.	Ni godha jedheen yaada qofa.
He just needs luck.	Carraa qofa isa barbaachisa.
I know it wasn’t easy.	Salphaa akka hin turre nan beeka.
It was all very vague.	Hundi isaa baayyee ifa hin taane ture.
Not all, but many do.	Hundi miti, garuu baay'een ni godhu.
Our stuff is not much.	Wanti keenya baay'ee miti.
But they always know.	Garuu isaan yeroo hundumaa beekuu.
As they are with us.	Akkuma nu bira jiru.
I told you just one.	Tokko qofa sitti hime.
I'm not there.	Ani hin jiru.
But that will never happen.	Garuu sun gonkumaa hin ta'u.
It can last a few weeks.	Torban muraasaaf turuu danda'a.
They say it wasn't.	Hin turre jedhu.
None of that mattered.	Sana keessaa tokkollee dhimma hin qabu ture.
That he then needed someone with a sense of humor.	Sana booda nama miira qoosaa qabu akka isa barbaachisu.
Maybe there was nothing inside.	Tarii keessa isaa wanti tokkollee hin turre ta'a.
It was a huge mistake.	Dogoggora guddaa ture.
He just couldn’t make it work.	Inni akka hojjetu gochuu qofa hin dandeenye.
But it will be too late.	Garuu yeroon booda ta'a.
They are nothing.	Isaan homaa miti.
But he really didn’t have to.	Dhuguma garuu dirqama hin qabu ture.
It started with nothing.	Homaa tokko malee jalqabe.
But you have another one.	Garuu kan biraa qabda.
It could have been worse.	Silaa kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
I can see it clearly.	Ani sirriitti arguu nan danda'a.
I'm looking at that.	Sana ilaalaa jira.
It’s not you.	Ati miti.
Those people need help.	Namoonni sun gargaarsa barbaadu.
It's not bad.	Hamaa miti.
It still wasn’t enough.	Ammas gahaa hin turre.
It is very new.	Baayyee haaraa dha.
So we really have a lot to do.	Kanaaf dhuguma waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabna.
He says maybe.	Tarii jedha.
He was infamous.	Inni maqaa gaarii hin qabne ture.
Never thought of a way.	Gonkumaa karaa hin yaadne.
Some people were going.	Namoonni tokko tokko deemaa turan.
This is what is happening in your case.	Dhimma keessan keessatti waan ta'aa jiru kana.
What else could go wrong?.	Kan biraa maaltu dogoggora ta'uu danda'a?.
He's pretty much the same.	Inni baayyee wal fakkaata.
I have lots and lots of questions.	Gaaffii baay'ee fi baay'ee qaba.
Everyone is different.	Namni hundi adda adda.
No one else does.	Namni biraa hin godhu.
I think it was bad.	Hamaa ture jedheen yaada.
Except he didn’t.	Inni hin goone malee.
She probably never will.	Isheen tarii gonkumaa hin gootu ta'a.
It doesn't help much.	Baay'ee hin gargaaru.
None of them spoke for a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf isaan keessaa tokkollee hin dubbanne.
She always had her way.	Yeroo hundumaa karaa ishee qabdi turte.
I didn't understand that.	Sana hin hubanne.
I love this picture.	Suuraa kana baay'een jaalladha.
I don't say that.	Akkas hin jedhu.
They were older.	Isaan umuriin isaanii guddaa ture.
People need to see that and know that.	Namoonni sana arguu fi beekuu qabu.
Not the same person.	Nama tokko miti.
Most of the time, you don't have that.	Yeroo baayyee, sana hin qabdu.
I think he’s in trouble.	Rakkoo keessa jira jedheen yaada.
I think that would be too extreme.	Sun garmalee garmalee ta'a jedheen yaada.
It could happen anytime.	Yoomiyyuu ta'uu danda'a.
We have a date.	Guyyaa qabna.
It’s a good name.	Maqaa gaarii dha.
But that may not do anything for me.	Garuu sun homaa naaf gochuu dhiisuu danda'a.
He knew a lot of things.	Waan baay'ee beeka ture.
I have some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko qaba.
They all work together.	Hundi isaanii waliin hojjetu.
It’s just a question of what you like to eat.	Gaaffii maal nyaachuu jaallattu qofa.
It's been happening.	Ta'ee jira.
That can't be right though.	Sun sirrii ta'uu hin danda'u malee.
It must be something.	Waan tokko ta'uu qaba.
We have to believe that.	Sana amanuu qabna.
Nothing happens without a reason.	Sababa malee wanti ta'u tokkollee hin jiru.
That’s the most helpful thing.	Wanti hunda caalaa gargaaru kanuma.
The problem was, it wasn’t enough.	Rakkoon ture, gahaa hin turre.
It was very, very real .	Baayyee baay'ee dhugaa ture .
Things used to be bad.	Duraan wanti hamaa ture.
As if it were	Akka waan .
Which, really is just as good.	Kan, dhuguma akkuma kana gaarii dha.
This thing would work.	Wanti kun ni hojjeta ture.
That's why it had to be.	Kanaaf ta'uu qaba ture.
Not everyone can work here.	Asitti namni hundi hojjechuu hin danda'u.
You have to play more.	Caalaatti taphachuu qabda.
The people in the room were not much different.	Namoonni kutaa sana keessa turan baayʼee adda hin turre.
You have to have one.	Tokko qabaachuu qabda.
Just like my life exactly.	Akkuma jireenya koo sirriitti.
A lot of things.	Waan baay'ee.
It will be a few weeks before they arrive.	Isaan dhufuu isaanii dura torban muraasa booda ta'a.
This is not so perfect.	Kun akkas guutuu miti.
They have to see me.	Na arguu qabu.
It wasn’t an accident.	Balaa hin turre.
It was their way.	Karaa isaanii ture.
I used to have no one at that time.	Duraan yeroo sanatti nama hin qabne ture.
But the best one.	Garuu isa gaarii.
I doubt there is.	Ni jira jedheen shakka.
I couldn’t get enough of him.	Isa gahaa argachuu hin dandeenye.
It won't happen now.	Amma hin ta'u.
You really can.	Dhuguma ni dandeessa.
I couldn’t see it anymore.	Sana booda arguu hin dandeenye.
He seems to know too much.	Garmalee waan beeku fakkaata.
It was his duty.	Dirqama isaa ture.
You can still make her human.	Ammas nama ishee gochuu dandeessa.
Loneliness and exclusion at school.	Mana barumsaa keessatti kophaa ta'uu fi ala ta'uu.
But at the time it seemed great.	Yeroo sanatti garuu waan guddaa fakkaata ture.
We all have interests.	Hundi keenya fedhii qabna.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Akkas ta'uu isaa mirkanaa'aa miti.
No one else can do it.	Namni biraa gochuu hin danda'u.
It was always hers.	Yeroo hundumaa kan ishee ture.
You don't know where he is.	Eessa akka jiru hin beektu.
I know exactly what it is.	Maal akka ta'e sirriitti beeka.
Long, this time.	Dheeraa, yeroo kana.
He got that from them.	Sana isaan irraa argate.
This would not be an easy task, for sure.	Kun hojii salphaa hin ta’u ture, mirkanaa’aa dha.
The biggest one? 	Kan guddaa?
No one else spoke.	Namni biraa hin dubbanne.
Chances are not real.	Carraan dhugaa miti.
It was a dress, as it were.	Uffata ture, akka waan.
I was everything.	Ani waan hundumaa ture.
You know him much better than we do.	Ati nu caalaa baayʼee isa beekta.
They are not good parents.	Warra gaarii miti.
That night was ours.	Halkan sun kan keenya ture.
No one would disagree with this.	Namni kana irratti walii hin galle hin jiru.
People say things have a reason.	Namoonni wanti tokko sababa qaba jedhu.
They have to go with that time.	Yeroo sana waliin deemuu qabu.
Most people don't have it.	Namoonni baay'een hin qaban.
It doesn't go quickly.	Dafee hin deemu.
You may have friends who already have kids.	Hiriyyoota duraan ijoollee qaban qabaachuu dandeessa.
All together now.	Hundi waliin amma.
Then, it would be the right time.	Sana booda, yeroo sirrii ta’a ture.
He didn't tell me who he was.	Eenyu akka ta'e natti hin himne.
He knows exactly.	Inni sirriitti beeka.
Take a look at this.	Mee kana ilaalaa.
That is often all that is needed.	Yeroo baayʼee wanta barbaachisu kana qofa.
But it could be a lot worse than that.	Garuu kana caalaa baayyee hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
This may work, but it may not work.	Kun hojjechuu danda'a, garuu hojjechuu dhiisuu danda'a.
Then a week later.	Sana booda torban tokko.
Sometimes, we all agree.	Yeroo tokko tokko, hundi keenya walii galle.
It has a big issue.	Dhimma guddaa qaba.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
I don’t know where I’m going.	Eessa akkan deemu hin beeku.
It would all be easy.	Hundi isaa salphaa ta'a ture.
I just don’t know how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu qofa hin beeku.
I don't know why this happens.	Kun maaliif akka ta'u hin beeku.
There are three people in the room with me.	Kutaa sana keessa namoonni sadii na waliin jiru.
A good teacher.	Barsiisaa gaarii.
It hasn’t worked yet.	Hanga ammaatti hin hojjenne.
He spoke too much.	Garmalee dubbate.
That's very nice.	Sun baayyee namatti tola.
Of course not often.	Yeroo baayyee akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It was the good and the bad.	Kan gaarii fi hamaa ture.
Who knows what could happen if he does.	Yoo godhe maaltu ta'uu akka danda'u eenyutu beeka.
But it’s still not good enough.	Garuu ammallee gaarii miti.
But, it never happened.	Garuu, gonkumaa hin taane.
You can stay indoors.	Mana keessa turuu dandeessu.
But I have an idea.	Ani garuu yaada tokko qaba.
He shouldn’t have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu hin qabu ture.
It has a light.	Ifa qaba.
That’s really special.	Sun dhuguma adda.
Without doing anything.	Osoo homaa hin hojjenne.
This work, however, is a bit different.	Hojiin kun garuu xiqqoo adda.
She really had it in for me.	Dhuguma naaf keessa qabdi turte.
She was more than a daughter to him.	Isheen isaaf intala caalaa turte.
I know it’s too late.	Yeroon isaa akka darbe nan beeka.
Only one this time, a girl.	Yeroo kana tokko qofa, intala.
I didn’t say anything like that.	Ani waan akkasii hin dubbanne.
You can quit your job.	Hojii kee dhiisuu dandeessa.
That's not what happened here.	Kan asitti ta'e garuu kanuma miti.
This will have to be done.	Kun gochuun dirqama ta'a.
It should have been just three.	Sadii qofa ta'uu qaba ture.
Now look at you.	Amma si ilaalaa.
Perhaps he could find some clarity there.	Tarii achitti ifa taʼe tokko tokko argachuu dandaʼa taʼa.
I didn't do this today.	Har'a kana hin goone.
It happened yesterday.	Kaleessa ta'e.
He loves it, all of it.	Inni ni jaallata, hunda isaa.
He didn’t stay there long.	Yeroo dheeraa achi hin turre.
Hopefully it will work then.	Yeroo sanatti akka hojjetu abdii qabna.
It had been an accident.	Balaa ta'ee ture.
Not necessary but but you can.	Barbaachisaa miti garuu garuu ni dandeessa.
If it doesn't, it won't.	Yoo hin taane hin ta'u.
It worked very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjete.
The obvious thing.	Wanti ifa ta'e.
Some people on the street he didn’t know.	Namoota tokko tokko karaa irratti inni hin beekne.
Maybe you were right.	Tarii ati sirrii turte ta'a.
I mean, of course not.	Akka hin taane beekamaadha jechuu kooti.
He considered not answering at all.	Tasumaa deebii kennuu dhiisuu yaade.
A lot can happen over time.	Yeroo booda wanti baay'een ta'uu danda'a.
In good times.	Yeroo gaarii keessatti.
The homeless problem, however, comes first.	Rakkoon mana hin qabne garuu hunda dura.
That is not the case here.	Asitti akkas miti.
You know exactly what that was.	Sun maal akka ture sirriitti beekta.
You are sure that you are.	Mirkanaa'aa akka jirtu.
Not that he would have done well.	Silaa waan gaarii hojjete jechuu miti.
They should earn a good reputation.	Maqaa gaarii argachuu qabu.
We don’t belong here.	Nuti kan as hin taane.
He'll be fine.	Inni gaarii ta'a.
It was something that was there.	Waan achi ture ture.
There were three people.	Namoonni sadii turan.
This was not one of those times.	Yeroon kun yeroo sana keessaa tokko hin turre.
And I went upstairs.	Anis ol ba'e.
I think he likes that idea.	Yaada sana waan jaallatu natti fakkaata.
He just does it.	Inni qofa ni hojjeta.
We both needed that.	Lamaan keenyayyuu sana nu barbaachisa ture.
He had a reason to tell her.	Sababa itti himu qaba ture.
He wouldn’t exist anymore.	Silaa kana booda hin jiru ture.
There is no right or wrong.	Sirrii fi dogoggora hin jiru.
And it was them again.	Ammas isaan ture.
I don’t think of them.	Ani isaan hin yaadu.
A very different case.	Dhimma baayyee adda ta'e.
Which is something very special.	Kan waan baayyee adda ta'e.
It really wouldn’t do anything right now.	Dhuguma yeroo ammaa kana homaa hin hojjetu ture.
You have no reason.	Sababa hin qabdu.
He’s not a bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa miti.
She was just living her life to the fullest.	Jireenya ishee guutummaatti jiraachuu qofa turte.
It didn't look like much.	Baay'ee hin fakkaatu ture.
They always come here.	Yeroo hunda as dhufu.
It was me that she couldn’t stay.	Ana ture kan isheen turuu hin dandeenye.
But this was not the only problem.	Garuu rakkoo kana qofa hin turre.
Except, of course, there was someone.	Malee, beekamaadha, namni tokko akka ture beekamaadha.
That’s not my point at all.	Sun tasumaa yaada koo miti.
It's not necessarily a good thing.	Waan gaarii ta'uu hin qabu.
It totally works .	Guutummaatti ni hojjeta .
I want you to go with him.	Isa waliin akka deemtu nan barbaada.
He was something different.	Inni waan adda ta'ee ture.
Not so, obviously.	Akkas miti, ifaadha.
I couldn't say exactly why.	Maaliif akka ta'e sirriitti dubbachuu hin dandeenye.
There is a right time.	Yeroon sirrii ta'e tokko jira.
We were going to be a problem.	Rakkoo ta'uuf turre.
They were certainly premature.	Yeroo malee akka turan beekamaadha.
I don't have anything like that.	Ani waan akkasii hin qabu.
Been there, done that, know it well.	Achi ture, sana godhe, sirriitti beeka.
You know the way home from here.	Karaa manaa as irraa beekta.
All her friends.	Hiriyyoota ishee hunda.
But, that’s just my opinion.	Garuu, sun yaada koo qofa.
He said it was just a joke.	Qoosaa qofa jedhe.
But I couldn’t live with her.	Garuu ishee waliin jiraachuu hin dandeenye.
You have to have that mindset.	Yaada sana qabaachuu qabda.
No one saw anything.	Namni homaa arge hin turre.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book.	Kitaaba kana sirriitti itti gammade.
I didn’t know her.	Ani ishee hin beeku ture.
He could have done better.	Kana caalaa hojjechuu dandaʼa ture.
Maybe he could have done things differently.	Tarii waan adda ta'e hojjechuu danda'a ture.
Same old house.	Mana durii wal fakkaatu.
I never know what to think of it.	Maal akkan itti yaadu gonkumaa hin beeku.
Apparently he didn’t.	Akkas hin goone fakkaata.
I just don't know what it is.	Maal akka ta'e qofa hin beeku.
A lot of money.	Maallaqa guddaa.
I love him very much.	Ani baay'een isa jaalladha.
What does that say.	Sun maal jedha.
It would have been great.	Silaa guddaa ta'a.
He just loves to joke.	Inni qoosaa qofa jaallatu.
It’s not really a problem.	Dhuguma rakkoo miti.
She was like that .	Isheen akkas turte .
He bought it for you.	Siif bite.
Thus, I am sorry.	Akka kanaan dhiifama.
I was interested.	Ani fedhii qaba ture.
He would have been that person.	Silaa nama sana ta'a ture.
I do, a lot.	Ani nan godha, baay'ee.
If not, you have to work your way through it.	Yoo hin taane karaa kee hojjechuu qabda.
They have no truth.	Dhugaa hin qaban.
At that time John's.	Yeroo sanatti kan Yohaannis.
He is two years old.	Umuriin isaa waggaa lama.
But it's nothing.	Garuu homaa miti.
Nobody really knew.	Dhuguma namni beeku hin turre.
But that’s not all.	Garuu kana qofa miti.
Two weeks today.	Torban lama har'a.
You are right that it is not easy.	Salphaa akka hin taane sirrii dha.
Today is the year of.	Har'a bara...
Someone is still in there.	Namni tokko ammallee achi keessa jira.
What happened cannot be undone.	Wanti ta'e duubatti deebi'uu hin danda'u.
Here, that was not the case.	Asitti, akkas hin turre.
You’re doing your best.	Waan dandeessu hunda hojjechaa jirta.
Maybe there is no problem at all.	Tarii rakkoon tokkollee hin jiru ta'a.
We need to be clear on that.	Sana irratti ifa ta'uu qabna.
There is no other time to be in it.	Yeroon biraa keessa jiraachuu hin jiru.
It really doesn’t matter.	Dhuguma homaa hin qabu.
She didn't want this.	Kana hin barbaaddu turte.
I will be that guy.	Ani gurbaa sana ta'a.
I don't want that either.	Anis akkas hin barbaadu.
We need to be their voice.	Sagalee isaanii ta'uu qabna.
This way you know they’re real.	Haala kanaan dhugaa ta’uu isaanii ni beekta.
I can never be anything else with her.	Ishee waliin gonkumaa waan biraa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Who is ours.	Eenyu kan keenya.
You still don't know what's right for you.	Ammallee waan siif ta'u hin beektu.
He’s always done that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas gochaa ture.
They still love me.	Ammallee na jaallatu.
But he tried.	Garuu yaale.
I think she was really just lonely.	Dhuguma isheen kophaa ishee qofa turte jedheen yaada.
To be complete.	Guutuu ta'uuf.
They should get a room.	Kutaa tokko argachuu qabu.
Not even a little bit.	Xiqqoo illee miti.
Now was his chance.	Amma carraan isaa ture.
But this is not true.	Garuu kun dhugaa miti.
They were not themselves.	Isaan ofii isaanii hin turre.
It was three in the afternoon.	Sa'aatii sadii waaree booda ture.
You can go now, today, this time.	Amma, har'a, yeroo kana deemuu dandeessa.
Worked very well on it.	Baayyee gaarii irratti hojjete.
The hope was it wasn’t too late.	Abdiin ture yeroon booda hin turre.
It was what she wanted.	Waan isheen barbaaddu ture.
Everything seemed much clearer now.	Amma wanti hundi baayyee ifa fakkaata ture.
I wasn’t alone for long.	Yeroo dheeraaf kophaa koo hin turre.
I can't be one of those people though.	Ani garuu namoota sana keessaa tokko ta'uu hin danda'u.
She hadn’t noticed that.	Isheen kana hin hubanne turte.
I didn’t see that one coming.	Tokko sana dhufuu hin argine.
All we can do is stay with him.	Wanti nuti gochuu dandeenyu isa bira jiraachuu qofa.
I can't ask, I can't tell, I can't speak .	Gaafachuu hin danda'u, himuu hin danda'u, dubbachuu hin danda'u .
It can't be, but it was right there.	Ta'uu hin danda'u, garuu sirriitti achi ture.
This is a very important apology.	Kun dhiifama baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
This is my life, he thought.	Kun jireenya kooti jedhee yaade.
What are you waiting for.	Maal eegaa jirtu.
You can do nothing and do no good.	Homaa gochuu fi waan gaarii hojjechuu hin dandeessu.
At the door.	Balbala irratti.
He didn’t want to be here.	Inni as jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
It's like that with everything.	Waan hundumaa wajjin akkas ta'a.
There was a lot of drinking.	Dhugaatii baay'ee ture.
Nothing much matters without it.	Isa malee wanti baay'ee barbaachisaa ta'e hin jiru.
I want to be a good husband and father.	Abbaa manaa fi abbaa gaarii ta'uu barbaada.
I have a problem with that part.	Kutaa sana irratti rakkoon qaba.
He is a man of.	Inni nama...
But this is not the case.	Garuu kun miti.
He knew she loved him.	Isheen akka isa jaallattu ni beeka ture.
In this case one of two things will happen.	Haala kana keessatti waan lama keessaa tokko ni ta'a.
They are not his.	Isaan kan isaa miti.
But it can't be.	Garuu ta'uu hin danda'u.
They had to go!.	Deemuu qabu turan!.
Tell them you are there.	Ati akka jirtu itti himi.
I wasn't sure he even understood it correctly.	Sirriitti illee akka hubate mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
I'm not kidding.	Ani qoosaa hin jiru.
This is really getting ridiculous.	Kun dhuguma qoosaa ta'aa jira.
He had good reasons for doing so.	Kana gochuuf sababa gaarii qaba ture.
But not everything.	Garuu waan hundumaa miti.
During.	Yeroo.
This is something new.	Kun waan haaraa dha.
They were there yesterday.	Kaleessa achi turan.
Maybe three, but no more.	Tarii sadii ta'uu danda'a, garuu kana caalaa hin ta'u.
This is your whole.	Kun guutuu keessan.
They may not get it.	Tarii argachuu dhiisuu danda'u.
Which can be a good thing.	Kan waan gaarii ta'uu danda'u.
There are no shoes.	Kophee hin jiru.
There were plenty of both this year.	Bara kana lamaan isaanii baay'ee turan.
But I didn’t know anyone well.	Garuu nama tokkollee akka gaariitti hin beekne.
It was too late.	Yeroon isaa baayyee booda ture.
I'm a good person.	Ani nama gaarii.
I always want to be doing something else.	Yeroo hundumaa waan biraa hojjechaa jiraachuu nan barbaada.
He had a way with people.	Namoota waliin karaa qaba ture.
He said try it tonight.	Halkan kana yaalaa jedhe.
It’s still inside him, in his eyes.	Ammallee keessa isaa jira, ija isaa keessa.
It was a whole new feeling.	Miira guutummaatti haaraa ture.
Big problem with work.	Hojii waliin rakkoo guddaa.
Maybe even three.	Tarii sadii illee ta'uu danda'a.
I still have time to go.	Ammas yeroon deemu qaba.
That is the real reason.	Sababni dhugaa kanuma.
It’s all one person.	Hundi isaa nama tokko.
But he can't.	Garuu hin danda'u.
I have no idea what is important.	Waan barbaachisaa ta'e yaada hin qabu.
Why didn’t you go for it.	Maaliif itti hin deemne.
You have no idea where you are.	Bakka jirtu yaada hin qabdu.
Everyone was very nice.	Namni hundi baayyee namatti tola ture.
We needed more tomorrow.	Boru kana caalaa barbaachisa ture.
They do something.	Waan tokko hojjetu.
He said that.	Akkas jedheera.
We have to go now.	Amma deemuu qabna.
Maybe no one noticed.	Tarii namni hubate hin jiru ta'a.
I need some ideas.	Yaada tokko tokko na barbaachisa.
But they work well for me.	Garuu akka gaariitti naaf hojjetu.
Be with them.	Isaan waliin ta'aa.
I think it’s very important.	Baayyee barbaachisaa natti fakkaata.
It happened very quickly.	Baayyee dafee ta'e.
You can ask there.	Achitti gaafachuu dandeessu.
I couldn't say anything.	Homaa jechuu hin dandeenye.
Nothing else is needed.	Wanti biraa hin barbaachisu.
The afternoon is mine.	Waaree booda kan kooti.
It took us two months.	Ji'a lama nutti fudhate.
That was so obvious.	Sun akka malee ifa ture.
I said they could.	Ni danda'u jedheen.
It won't be, sorry.	Hin ta'u dhiifama.
He wouldn't tell me what he said.	Waan isaan jedhe natti hin himu ture.
They don’t have money in work.	Hojii keessatti qarshii hin qaban.
But they never get their hands on him.	Garuu gonkumaa harka isaanii isa hin qaban.
I think it will be good.	Gaarii ta'a jedheen yaada.
Probably it was him.	Tarii isa ta'uu hin oolu.
He did not make any doors.	Balbala tokkollee hin goone.
He didn't seem to belong there now.	Amma kan achi ta'e hin fakkaatu ture.
We stayed all night.	Halkan guutuu turre.
If and when he did.	Yoo fi yoom godhe.
He should have done better.	Silaa kana caalaa hojjechuu qaba ture.
You can't live.	Jiraachuu hin dandeessu.
Something you need to do more.	Waan caalaatti hojjechuu qabdu.
I have to do something to help my father.	Abbaa koo gargaaruuf waan tokko gochuu qaba.
I just don’t want to go right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana deemuu qofa hin barbaadu.
They don’t have to know how it works.	Akkamitti akka hojjetu beekuu hin qaban.
This has been my whole life.	Kun jireenya koo guutuu ta'ee jira.
That seemed like a lifetime ago.	Sun jireenya guutuu dura fakkaata ture.
But not to my father.	Garuu abbaa kootti miti.
Not enough food.	Nyaata gahaa miti.
It was more than that.	Caalaatti ture.
Look at that one.	Isa sana ilaalaa.
Maybe not in our lifetime.	Tarii jireenya keenya keessatti hin ta'u ta'a.
It wasn't always going to be that way though.	Yeroo hundumaa garuu akkas ta'uuf hin turre.
He wouldn’t have been here at all.	Silaa tasumaa as hin turre.
This is something new.	Kun waan haaraa dha.
Then, he went away.	Sana booda, deeme.
I don’t want you to drive.	Konkolaataa akka deemtu hin barbaadu.
They have the same hope that everyone else has.	Abdii namni hundi qabu tokko qabu.
It would have done little.	Silaa waan xiqqoo hojjeta ture.
But he really knows what he wants.	Garuu dhuguma waan barbaadu beeka.
I’m not a shoe man.	Ani nama kophee qabu miti.
Maybe it wasn’t loud enough.	Tarii sagalee guddaa hin qabu ture.
So there were a couple of good ideas.	Kanaaf yaada gaarii lama lama turan.
There was not a shred of light.	Ifa xiqqoo tokkollee hin turre.
I have absolutely no idea.	Ani gonkumaa yaada hin qabu.
Time is our problem.	Yeroon rakkoo keenya.
It seems a little now.	Xiqqoo amma fakkaata.
You can see that.	Sana arguu dandeessu.
I went, I went, I went.	Deeme, deeme, deeme.
So he can't find me.	Kanaaf na argachuu hin danda'u.
He was at home here.	Asitti mana ture.
But it was a mistake.	Garuu dogoggora ture.
Look at yourself.	Of ilaalaa.
There should be no such thing.	Wanti akkasii jiraachuu hin qabu.
It is in another place.	Bakka biraa keessa jira.
But you had to be in the mood.	Garuu miira keessa jiraachuu qabda turte.
I can't believe that.	Sana amanuu hin danda'u.
No one ever does.	Namni gonkumaa godhu hin jiru.
I don't have much to offer.	Waan baay'ee hin qabu.
He didn't tell me what happened.	Waan ta'e natti hin himne.
But not this time.	Yeroo kana garuu miti.
It was right though.	Sirrii ture garuu.
It seemed like an important part.	Kutaa barbaachisaa fakkaata ture.
Where to go.	Bakka itti deemu.
That can't be the case.	Sun ta'uu hin danda'u.
Not admitting mistakes.	Dogoggora amanuu dhiisuu.
Very bad idea.	Yaada baayyee hamaa.
I couldn't leave it.	Dhiisuu hin dandeenye.
Exactly who started it.	Eenyu akka jalqabe sirriitti.
It’s completely fine.	Guutummaatti gaarii dha.
I don't want to do it.	Ani gochuu hin barbaadu.
It’s still good, though .	Ammallee gaarii dha, garuu .
But that is not the case with us.	Garuu akkas miti kan keenya.
But everything was fine.	Garuu wanti hundi gaarii ture.
He understood better now how it could be.	Akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u amma caalaatti hubate.
I know you can do it.	Akka ati gochuu dandeessu nan beeka.
I still think you should give me some time.	Ammas yeroo muraasa naaf kennuu qabdu jedheen yaada.
I can't do that unless you excuse me.	Yoo ati dhiifama naaf goote malee akkas gochuu hin danda'u.
That he still loves me.	Ammallee akka na jaallatu.
This was just fine.	Kun gaarii qofa ture.
This was the answer, I was sure.	Kun deebii ture, mirkanaa'aa ture.
He started walking again.	Ammas deemuu jalqabe.
That’s fine, you might say.	Sun gaarii dha jechuu dandeessa.
But there is one exception.	Garuu kan ala ta'e tokko.
It’s after two.	Lama booda dha.
They all knew, they didn’t tell me.	Hundi isaanii ni beeku, natti hin himne.
Glad to see you.	Si arguu kootti gammadeera.
He knew everything about me.	Waa'ee koo waan hundumaa beeka ture.
But, he doesn’t do that.	Garuu, akkas hin godhu.
None of it matters.	Isa keessaa tokkollee dhimma hin qabu.
I mean, look at me.	Na ilaalaa jechuu kooti.
But this is certainly not true.	Garuu kun dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It was all of this.	Kana hunda ture.
But that doesn’t mean you’re not a great person.	Garuu ati nama guddaa miti jechuu miti.
They say it is only a matter of time.	Dhimma yeroo qofa jedhu.
Which, of course, is definitely not the case.	Kan, beekamaadha, akka hin taane beekamaadha.
She would have been a great mother and a great home.	Silaa haadha guddaa fi mana guddaa qabdu turte.
This one is great.	Inni kun guddaa dha.
It's always like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'a.
I haven’t been there before.	Kanaan dura achi hin turre.
But he knew it was true.	Garuu dhugaa ta'uu isaa beeka ture.
But nothing came of it.	Garuu wanti dhufe hin jiru.
It was just here, now.	As qofa ture, amma.
He has really good hands.	Dhuguma harka gaarii qaba.
You made it happen.	Ati akka ta'u goote.
He needs money	Maallaqa barbaada .
I think he knows his own name very well.	Maqaa ofii isaa baayyee waan beeku natti fakkaata.
So now you know how.	Kanaaf akkamitti akka ta'e amma beekta.
I love all those people.	Namoota sana hunda nan jaalladha.
Not a whole three.	Sadii guutuu miti.
He had good hands.	Harka gaarii qaba ture.
You won’t do that anymore.	Kana booda akkas hin gootu.
This is when it happened.	Yeroo kana ta'e.
But it may not be.	Garuu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
You can go to him.	Gara isaa deemuu dandeessa.
I didn’t want to do school work.	Hojii mana barumsaa hojjechuu hin barbaanne.
I would never, ever do that in my life.	Jireenya koo keessatti gonkumaa, gonkumaa akkas hin godhu ture.
People loved working there.	Namoonni achitti hojjechuu ni jaallatu turan.
He has to live with his affairs.	Dhimma isaa waliin jiraachuu qaba.
You don’t seem to be.	Ati hin fakkaattu.
I think maybe it should be.	Tarii ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
One good interview.	Gaaffii fi deebii gaarii tokko.
But this was not always the case.	Garuu kun yeroo hundumaa hin turre.
It was time to get real.	Yeroon isaa dhugaa ta'uu qabu ture.
It’s everywhere.	Bakka hunda jira.
Sounds like a lot of life.	Jireenya baay'ee fakkaata.
But a lot of people were probably trying.	Garuu namoonni baay'een yaalaa turan ta'uu hin oolu.
He was just here this morning.	Inni ganama kana qofa as ture.
Clearly, nothing happened.	Wanti taʼe akka hin jirre ifaadha.
But now was not the time.	Amma garuu yeroon isaa hin turre.
I know you can do it.	Akka dandeessu nan beeka.
She doesn’t need any trouble.	Rakkoo tokkollee ishee hin barbaachisu.
We are trying to do something about it in our lives.	Jireenya keenya keessatti waan tokko itti gochuuf yaalaa jirra.
He has two children.	Ijoollee lama qaba.
He kind of lived in there.	Inni akka waan achi keessa jiraata ture.
You can even scream.	Iyyuu dandeessa.
He wasn’t the only one.	Inni qofa hin turre.
He was going to do something.	Inni waan tokko gochuuf ture.
More like curiosity.	Caalaatti fedhii beekuu fakkaata.
We can’t do it alone.	Kophaa keenya gochuu hin dandeenyu.
It looks good.	Gaarii fakkaata.
To work with sound.	Sagalee wajjin hojjechuuf.
Once upon a time,	Yeroo tokko, .
Not a great hope.	Abdii guddaa miti.
Keep it in there.	Achi keessa eegaa.
You need it .	Si barbaachisa .
Very much work.	Baay'ee hojii.
Nobody really noticed it before.	Dhuguma kanaan dura namni hubate hin jiru.
He didn't do anything.	Homaa hin goone.
I would have had to go.	Silaa deemuun dirqama ture.
He's doing his best.	Waan danda'u hunda gochaa jira.
Now, everything in life is risky.	Amma, jireenya keessatti wanti hundi balaa qaba.
I thought you were.	Ati natti fakkaate.
This seemed to be happening.	Kun waan ta'aa jiru fakkaata ture.
No one looked at anyone else.	Namni nama biraa ilaale hin jiru.
Look at your mouth.	Afaan keessan ilaalaa.
Everyone in here knows this.	Namni as keessa jiru hundi kana ni beeka.
I did it for him.	Ani isa godhe.
His life's work.	Hojii jireenya isaa.
This was not his wife’s name.	Kun maqaa haadha manaa isaa hin turre.
But then I didn't know.	Sana booda garuu hin beeku ture.
Everyone wants money.	Namni hundi maallaqa barbaada.
I think it's all still very fresh.	Hundi isaa ammallee baayyee haaraa dha jedheen yaada.
When that happens, it's two on one.	Yeroo sun ta'u lama tokko irratti ta'a.
But not more than yourself.	Garuu ofii kee caalaa miti.
Everything was very nice.	Wanti hundi baayyee namatti tola ture.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Hin danda'u, hin danda'u, hin danda'u.
I'm not sure this is really about the picture.	Kun dhuguma waa'ee suuraa akka ta'e mirkanaa'aa miti.
I could have given all this up.	Silaa kana hunda dhiisuu nan danda'a ture.
But it’s not entirely wrong.	Garuu guutummaatti dogoggora miti.
It wasn’t that bad.	Hamma kana hamaa hin turre.
It worked against her.	Ishee irratti hojjete.
Neither of us have really been alone.	Lamaan keenyayyuu dhuguma kophaa keenya hin taane.
He wasn't entirely sure.	Inni guutummaatti mirkanaa'aa hin turre.
This was her greatest moment.	Yeroon kun yeroo ishee isa guddaa ture.
He didn't seek help.	Gargaarsa hin barbaanne.
That would just happen today.	Sun har'a qofa ta'a ture.
That's it so far.	Hanga ammaatti sun.
All you have is this moment.	Wanti ati qabdu yeroo kana qofa.
That was what we wanted.	Wanti nuti barbaanne kanuma ture.
Doing this seems to help quite a bit.	Kana gochuun xiqqoo waan gargaaru fakkaata.
Then again, the timing may not be right.	Sana booda ammas yeroon isaa sirrii ta’uu dhiisuu danda’a.
It was a school.	Mana barumsaa ture.
He couldn't answer.	Deebii kennuu hin dandeenye.
That is probably fine.	Sun gaarii taʼuu hin oolu.
She was looking the other way.	Karaa biraa ilaalaa turte.
That was really nice.	Sun dhuguma namatti tola ture.
Well not true, as it turns out.	Akka gaariitti dhugaa miti, akkuma ta'e.
It's been pretty bad.	Baayyee hamaa ta'ee jira.
Not that it matters now.	Amma dhimma qaba jechuu miti.
But it’s not her.	Garuu ishee miti.
It wasn’t like that.	Akkas hin turre.
But this is nothing new.	Kun garuu waan haaraa miti.
Then we have two issues.	Sana booda dhimma lama qabna.
This is just one person.	Kun nama tokko qofa.
I still don’t know what that looks like.	Sun maal akka fakkaatu ammallee hin beeku.
People didn’t want to know.	Namoonni beekuu hin barbaanne.
I am in danger.	Ani balaa keessa jira.
I’m doing my job.	Hojii koo hojjechaa jira.
It used to be so easy.	Kanaan dura akka malee salphaa ture.
So please has anyone done it before.	Kanaaf maaloo namni kanaan dura hojjete jiraa.
Now he's just a human being.	Amma nama qofa.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Tarii, tarii, tarii.
It should have been her.	Silaa ishee ta'uu qaba ture.
Many loved him.	Baay'een isa jaallatu turan.
They wouldn’t have needed it.	Silaa isaan hin barbaachisu ture.
Most of the time it doesn't happen.	Yeroo baay'ee hin ta'u.
Then something happened.	Sana booda wanti tokko ta'e.
We haven’t worked together for very long.	Baayyee yeroo dheeraa waliin hin hojjenne.
It took time.	Yeroo fudhate.
It was all about the passion.	Hundi isaa waaʼee fedhii sanaa ture.
But it shouldn't be like that.	Garuu akkas ta'uu hin qabu.
They thought they had this but apparently they didn’t.	Kana waan qaban itti fakkaate garuu akka hin taane fakkaata.
But not at all.	Garuu tasumaa miti.
It may be the case.	Ta'uu danda'a.
After that, no one knew where to go.	Sana booda namni eessa akka deemu hin beeku ture.
It's very clear.	Baayyee ifaadha.
He said it would be in the car.	Konkolaataa keessa ta'a jedhe.
I know what you want to say.	Waan dubbachuu barbaaddu nan beeka.
Not at all, not at all.	Tasumaa miti, tasumaa miti.
So you can go for it.	Kanaaf deemuu dandeessa.
It's not something that happens quickly.	Waan dafee ta'u miti.
I mean, it’s not just me.	Ana qofa miti jechuu kooti.
I didn't know that.	Ani akkas sana hin beeku ture.
I think it’s around there.	Naannoo achi jira jedheen yaada.
Not even her.	Ishee illee miti.
Sometimes it does, most of the time it doesn't.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni qaba, yeroo baay'ee hin qabu.
He was my man.	Inni nama koo ture.
Sorry something went wrong.	Dhiifama wanti tokko dogoggora ta'e.
It’s just not a good idea.	Yaada gaarii miti qofa.
He wonders what that might be.	Sun maal taʼuu dandaʼa jedhee yaada.
So, stay tuned with us.	Kanaaf, nu waliin eegaa.
I didn’t do any work that day.	Guyyaa sana hojii tokkollee hin hojjenne.
You can even quit.	Ati iyyuu dhiisuu dandeessa.
It came along well.	Akka gaariitti dhufe.
This can be serious.	Kun hamaa ta’uu danda’a.
It could have been his.	Silaa kan isaa ta'uu danda'a ture.
It wasn’t even a joke.	Qoosaa illee hin turre.
It doesn’t do me any good.	Gaarii naaf hin godhu.
That’s how it was.	Akkas ture.
But that’s all we thought.	Garuu kana qofa yaadne.
I wish we talked about it more.	Caalaatti waa'ee isaa yoo dubbanne natti tola.
They often did.	Yeroo baayʼee ni godhu turan.
Not yet that says.	Ammallee miti kan jedhu.
It all works but there is a problem.	Hundi ni hojjeta garuu rakkoon jira.
We are still looking into this.	Kana ammallee ilaalaa jirra.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
But they were there.	Garuu isaan achi turan.
It would never happen again.	Kana booda gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
So it must be great.	Kanaaf guddaa ta'uu qaba.
Time didn’t matter.	Yeroon homaa hin turre.
They always want more.	Yeroo hundumaa kana caalaa barbaadu.
You should see my house.	Mana koo arguu qabda.
It was an important answer at the time.	Yeroo sanatti deebii barbaachisaa ture.
It's not the right thing to do at all.	Tasumaa waan sirrii ta'e miti.
I am just one of you.	Ani isin keessaa tokko qofa.
But now it wasn’t.	Amma garuu akkas hin turre.
It won't be a problem.	Rakkoo hin ta'u.
She should have apologized to him.	Silaa dhiifama isa gaafachuu qabdi turte.
Which was real, of course.	Kan dhugaa ture beekamaadha.
It seems timeless.	Yeroo kan hin qabne fakkaata.
She didn’t want anyone else to know she was here.	As akka jirtu namni biraa akka beeku hin barbaanne.
No one else is around.	Namni biraa naannoo sana jiru hin jiru.
But it really didn’t happen.	Garuu dhuguma hin taane.
That wouldn’t help.	Sun hin gargaaru ture.
I have another one.	Kan biraa qaba.
We don’t need that now.	Amma sun nu hin barbaachisu.
It was her perfect afternoon.	Waaree booda ishee guutuu ture.
he needs it.	isa barbaachisa.
He didn’t say anything wrong.	Dogoggora hin dubbanne.
I certainly could.	Ani akkan dandaʼu beekamaadha.
But we are still here.	Garuu ammallee as jirra.
It is possible, however.	Ni danda'ama garuu.
But in this case .	Garuu haala kana keessatti .
It's been very accurate.	Baayyee sirrii ta'ee jira.
I said it was too good.	Garmalee gaarii dha jedheen ture.
That went well enough.	Sun akka gaariitti deeme.
Special.	Kan adda ta’e.
I don’t need your money.	Maallaqa kee na hin barbaachisu.
You are all looking at a good reality.	Hundi keessan dhugaa gaarii ilaalaa jirtu.
But that wasn’t the case this week.	Garuu torban kana akkas hin turre.
He wondered how many he couldn’t see.	Meeqa arguu hin dandeenye jedhee yaade.
He wasn't looking so good this morning.	Ganama kana akkas gaarii hin fakkaatu ture.
I wish I didn't have to go this route.	Osoo karaa kanaan deemuu hin qabu ta'ee natti tola.
They know it's a joke.	Qoosaa ta'uu isaa ni beeku.
What she did .	Waan isheen goote .
Never too much of a good thing.	Gonkumaa waan gaarii garmalee hin taane.
I know a lot about her, but certainly not everything.	Waa'ee ishee waan baay'een beeka, garuu waan hundumaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
That won't be enough.	Sun gahaa hin ta'u.
But, it quickly got easier.	Garuu, dafee salphaa ta'e.
A very big accident.	Balaa baayyee guddaa.
If something happens, it happens.	Yoo wanti tokko ta'e ni ta'a.
But it could be worse.	Garuu kana caalaa hamaa ta'uu danda'a.
I didn't want to know everything about her.	Waa'ee ishee waan hunda beekuu hin barbaanne.
You have a full life to live.	Jireenya guutuu jiraachuu qabdu qabda.
This was a desire.	Kun fedhii ture.
It was then.	Yeroo sana ture.
I just can't help myself.	Of gargaaruu qofa hin danda'u.
This is not an easy matter.	Kun dhimma salphaa miti.
He didn’t have time to think about it.	Yeroo itti yaadu hin qabu ture.
But he was our man, he had to be.	Garuu inni nama keenya ture, ta'uu qaba ture.
It really couldn’t be simpler.	Dhuguma kana caalaa salphaa ta’uu hin danda’u.
He knew me better than anyone.	Nama hunda caalaa na beeka ture.
They’re almost friends.	Hiriyyoota jechuun ni danda’ama.
I want it to happen.	Akka ta'u nan barbaada.
It must be a girl, he thought.	Intala ta'uu qaba jedhee yaade.
But they would have been wrong.	Garuu silaa dogoggora turan.
There was always a reason.	Yeroo hundumaa sababni jira ture.
One of them.	Isaan keessaa tokko.
It's about me.	Waa'ee kooti.
He looked at all of us there.	Warra achi turre hunda ilaale.
Someone like me.	Nama akka kootti.
I wasn't hoping that would happen.	Akkas ta'a jedhee abdii hin qabu ture.
You had to do this for me.	Kana naaf gochuu qabda turte.
If such ever comes out.	Yoo kan akkasii yoomiyyuu ba'e.
This doesn’t seem likely.	Kun waan ta’uu danda’u hin fakkaatu.
I enjoyed it very much.	Baayʼee itti gammadeera.
He did very well out there.	Achi keessaa baayyee gaarii hojjete.
Who did what he wanted.	Kan waan barbaade hojjete.
I wish none of us knew that.	Osoo namni keenya tokkollee akkas hin beekne natti tola.
As far as my room.	Hanga kutaa kootti.
A lot of people do.	Namoonni baay'een ni godhu.
He wants his father.	Abbaa isaa barbaada.
Sometimes it worked.	Yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta ture.
This is exactly what it is.	Kun sirriitti kanuma.
It's very good.	Baayyee gaarii dha.
Two hours later we did it again.	Sa'aatii lama booda ammas hojjenne.
I didn’t know her.	Ishee hin beeku ture.
I just have to say this.	Kana jechuu qofa qaba.
Good luck, hope this helps.	Carraa gaarii, kun akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
There are things you don't know about me.	Waa'ee koo wantoota ati hin beekne ni jiru.
He did a great job.	Hojii guddaa hojjete.
These are just kids.	Kun ijoollee qofa.
She was a problem.	Rakkoo turte.
It’s dangerous in there.	Achi keessa balaa qaba.
I did it often.	Yeroo baayʼee nan godha ture.
Doesn't seem to help much.	Waan baay'ee waan gargaaru hin fakkaatu.
He loved food.	Nyaata ni jaallata ture.
It’s not something as simple as that.	Waan akka sanaa salphaa miti.
She wasn’t important.	Isheen barbaachisaa hin turre.
No one else knows them.	Namni biraa isaan beeku hin jiru.
It may not be for you sooner.	Dafee siif ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
He just doesn't.	Inni hin ta'u qofa.
It had three rooms.	Kutaa sadii qaba ture.
This was everyone.	Kun nama hunda ture.
It’s not enough on its own.	Ofii isaatiin gahaa miti.
It’s like everything is in the eye.	Akka waan hunda ija keessa jira.
She didn’t need me to do that.	Isheen akkas gochuun na hin barbaachifne.
You seem to know a lot about this.	Waa'ee kanaa waan baay'ee beektu fakkaata.
He seems to have done so.	Inni akkas godhe fakkaata.
If they can go long enough.	Yoo gahaa ta’ee deemuu danda’u.
The important thing at all was to respond.	Wanti barbaachisaa ta'e tasumaa deebii kennuu ture.
But they were just too big.	Garuu isaan baayyee guddaa qofa turan.
You have such a good one.	Isa gaarii akkasii qabda.
It's going to be a disaster.	Balaa ta'uuf deema.
But it is not true in all cases.	Garuu haala hunda keessatti dhugaa miti.
I could find no reason for this.	Kanaaf sababa tokkollee argachuu hin dandeenye.
It was terrible.	Hamaa ture.
Someone should know.	Namni tokko beekuu qaba.
But I couldn't.	Ani garuu hin dandeenye.
There is only one thing we can do now.	Amma wanti gochuu dandeenyu tokko qofa.
Nothing, even.	Homaa miti, illee.
It was in a bar.	Mana dhugaatii tokko keessa ture.
It wasn’t necessary.	Barbaachisaa hin turre.
This is not your business.	Kun dhimma keessan miti.
But nobody said much.	Garuu namni baay'ee dubbate hin jiru.
This is not the answer.	Kun deebii miti.
Just like her own.	Akkuma kan ishee.
But it is not necessary.	Garuu hin barbaachisu.
He was being nice, trying to help me.	Inni nama gaarii ta'aa ture, na gargaaruuf yaalaa ture.
Fortunately, no one seemed to want it.	Akka carraa ta'ee namni waan barbaadu hin fakkaatu ture.
This can happen quickly.	Kun dafee ta’uu danda’a.
Then repeat twice.	Sana booda yeroo lama irra deebi’i.
There is no one	Namni tokkollee hin jiru .
Much, much more.	Hedduu hedduu caalaa.
But she doesn't do that.	Isheen garuu akkas hin gootu.
I can tell you your favorite picture.	Suuraa kee jaalladhu sitti himuu nan danda'a.
I would love to buy a whole lot of them.	Guutuu isaanii bitachuu nan jaalladha.
That was it.	Sana ture.
But other than that it was him.	Garuu kanaan ala isa ture.
That you have an issue.	Dhimma akka qabdu.
That was a complete disaster.	Sun balaa guutuu ture.
They know they weren’t.	Isaan akka turan mitii ni beeku.
They will go again.	Ammas ni deemu.
Bad, but nice.	Hamaa, garuu namatti tola.
Then everything works fine.	Sana booda wanti hundi gaarii ta'ee hojjeta.
You don't	Ati hin .
You have another job to do.	Hojii biraa hojjechuu qabdu.
It had been bad.	Hamaa ta'ee ture.
That’s pretty much all we can say.	Kana jechuun, baay’ee, waan jechuu dandeenyu qofa.
But this is something new.	Garuu kun waan haaraa dha.
We just have to make one comment.	Yaada tokko qofa kennuu qabna.
He still had a chance.	Ammas carraa qaba ture.
He loved the girl very much.	Intala sana baayʼee jaallata ture.
I wanted to know.	Ani beekuu barbaade.
But she was right.	Isheen garuu sirrii turte.
He wants to give up.	Harka kennuu barbaada.
But not much, see.	Garuu baay'ee miti ilaalaa.
But it really has to go further then that.	Garuu dhuguma sana booda kana caalaa deemuu qaba.
It had been good.	Gaarii ta'ee ture.
Over time this can happen.	Yeroo booda kun ta’uu danda’a.
She was my daughter.	Isheen intala koo turte.
This is going to work.	Kun hojjechuuf deema.
None of them worked.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee hin hojjenne.
A lot had happened.	Waan baay'een ta'ee ture.
But it still doesn't happen.	Garuu ammas hin ta'u.
There was nothing he could do now.	Amma wanti inni gochuu danda'u hin turre.
No one is here at all.	Namni asitti tasumaa hin jiru.
If he gets his way, he is in danger.	Karaa isaa yoo argate balaa keessa jira.
They have their jobs.	Hojii isaanii qabu.
It wasn’t someone he knew.	Nama inni beeku hin turre.
If so, it's a good idea.	Yoo akkas ta'e yaada gaarii dha.
He didn’t really get into it.	Inni dhuguma keessa hin galle.
Inside her clothes.	Uffata ishee keessaa.
I didn't think so.	Ani hin yaadne.
It’s not his joke.	Qoosaa isaa miti.
But that didn’t matter.	Garuu sun homaa hin turre.
He wants everyone.	Nama hunda barbaada.
I wasn’t there.	Ani hin turre.
He had no one else in sight.	Nama biraa ija keessa hin qabu ture.
He asked not to tell anyone.	Namatti akka hin himne gaafate.
Which isn’t bad.	Kan hamaa hin taane.
There was only one hope.	Abdiin tokko qofa ture.
He was in a room.	Kutaa tokko keessa ture.
Which is not extensive.	Kan bal'aa hin taane.
It was a great life.	Jireenya guddaa ture.
The problem still exists.	Rakkoon ammas jira.
I could just ask her.	Ishee gaafachuu qofa nan danda'a ture.
We were never alone.	Nuti gonkumaa kophaa keenya hin taane.
That’s nothing new.	Sun waan haaraa miti.
Where are you right now?.	Yeroo ammaa eessa jirta?.
No one passed me by.	Namni na bira darbe hin jiru.
That was just ridiculous.	Sun qoosaa qofa ture.
They always go go go go.	Yeroo hundumaa deemuu deemuu deemuu deemu.
He may know someone.	Nama tokko beekuu danda'a.
All of this is important.	Kun hundi barbaachisaa dha.
It just won't be anything else.	Waan biraa qofa hin ta'u.
It’s nothing too much.	Garmalee homaa miti.
I couldn’t see her in the crowd.	Namoota keessaa ishee arguu hin dandeenye.
It looks exactly the same to you.	Sitti sirriitti kanuma fakkaata.
He had her car.	Konkolaataa ishee qaba ture.
But another time .	Garuu yeroo biraa .
He was really into it.	Dhuguma keessa ture.
He could have stayed here.	As turuu danda'a ture.
After a long time.	Yeroo dheeraa booda.
The problem is here.	Rakkoon as jira.
But that is not what happens.	Garuu wanti ta'u akkas miti.
I am with him.	Ani isa waliin jira.
No one, really, was good enough.	Namni, dhuguma, gaarii gahaa hin turre.
Simple, but definitely not easy.	Salphaa, garuu salphaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
I think that looks good.	Sun gaarii fakkaata jedheen yaada.
Or for you	Siif moo .
Time passed quickly.	Yeroon dafee darbe.
They tell them their names.	Maqaa isaanii itti himu.
Up and around.	Ol fi naannoo.
He certainly did last year.	Bara darbe akka godhe beekamaadha.
This is still our time.	Yeroon kun ammallee yeroo keenya.
So, I may not do that now.	Kanaaf, amma akkas gochuu dhiisuu danda'a.
If so, many of us.	Yoo akkas ta'e baay'ee keenya.
I shouldn't have come back here.	Silaa as deebi'uu hin qabu ture.
Now it’s different with you.	Amma si waliin adda.
He hesitated before answering.	Deebii kennuu isaa dura duubatti jedhe.
He knows her well.	Inni sirriitti ishee beeka.
Age was not a factor.	Umuriin sababa hin turre.
They have what they need.	Waan isaan barbaachisu qabu.
He knew these people.	Namoota kana ni beeka ture.
It was a moment before she spoke.	Dubbachuu ishee dura yeroo muraasa ture.
I know this works.	Kun akka hojjetu nan beeka.
They were nothing.	Isaan homaa hin turre.
You know where you are.	Bakka jirtu ni beekta.
He wants him to go to his old school.	Mana barumsaa isaa isa durii akka deemu barbaada.
I'm just so excited.	Ani baay'een gammade qofa.
Walk through them.	Isaan keessa deemaa.
But that was a setback.	Garuu sun duubatti deebi'uu ture.
He wasn’t a bad guy.	Inni nama hamaa hin turre.
It's very nice.	Baayyee namatti tola.
And it happened again.	Ammas ta'e.
It couldn't have been better for us.	Kana caalaa nuuf ta'uu hin danda'u ture.
That’s not a joke.	Sun qoosaa miti.
We never seem to have enough time together.	Yeroo gahaa waliin qabnu gonkumaa hin fakkaatu.
They were absolutely .	Isaan guutummaatti turan .
None of them worked well.	Tokkollee akka gaariitti hin hojjenne.
So they were waiting.	Kanaaf eegaa turan.
It was easier than not doing it.	Gochuu dhiisuu caalaa salphaa ture.
It would have been	Silaa .
It will be fine without them.	Isaan malee gaarii ta'a.
But there are.	Garuu ni jiru.
This was pretty simple.	Kun baayyee salphaa ture.
This seems very hopeless.	Kun baayyee abdii kan hin qabne fakkaata.
I think it should be more.	Caalaatti ta'uu qaba jedheen yaada.
It is our duty.	Dirqama keenya.
I hope that's nothing.	Sun homaa akka ta'e abdiin qaba.
He’s probably with her.	Inni ishee waliin jiraachuu hin oolu.
I already started.	Duraan jalqabe.
She didn’t always think of you where you were.	Yeroo hundumaa bakka jirtu si hin yaaddu turte.
He wants more than anything.	Waan hundumaa caalaa barbaada.
Opportunity in many ways.	Carraa karaa baay'ee.
Which he probably has.	Kan inni qabaachuu hin oolu.
Not that bad of a car, even for us.	Konkolaataa hangas hamaa miti, nuuf illee.
She didn’t need to do what she did.	Waan goote gochuun ishee hin barbaachisu ture.
But nothing works for me.	Garuu wanti naaf hojjetu hin jiru.
She had many friends.	Hiriyyoota hedduu qabdi turte.
We were always together .	Yeroo hundumaa waliin turre .
He was a duty.	Inni dirqama ture.
He lives in the area.	Inni naannoo sana jiraata.
I'm not on a good answer yet.	Hanga ammaatti deebii gaarii irratti hin jiru.
This seems like such a great job.	Kun hojii guddaa akkasii fakkaata.
They have to work with us.	Nu waliin hojjechuu qabu.
She would never like him that much.	Isheen gonkumaa akkasitti isa hin jaallattu turte.
Even the same room.	Kutaa wal fakkaatu illee.
But a lot of people like me.	Garuu namoonni baay'een na jaallatu.
You were one of my people.	Ati namoota koo keessaa tokko turte.
But it's just that he's his father.	Garuu abbaa isaa ta'uu isaa qofa.
But now I can't find it.	Amma garuu argachuu hin danda'u.
No one tells me anything.	Namni homaa natti himu hin jiru.
But still not quite.	Garuu ammallee guutummaatti miti.
She had her children in there.	Ijoollee ishee achi keessa qabdi turte.
Things he has to fill.	Wantoota inni guutuu qabu.
Just the facts.	Dhugaa jiru qofa.
Like she needs me too much.	Akkuma isheen garmalee na barbaaddu.
It doesn't get any clearer.	Kana caalaa ifa hin ta'u.
I just knew everything.	Waan hundumaa beekuu qofa ture.
This is an important time.	Yeroon kun barbaachisaa dha.
If only it were ours.	Osoo kan keenya qofa ta'ee.
But this doesn’t seem right.	Garuu kun waan sirrii hin fakkaatu.
I really want that.	Sana baay'een barbaada.
I'm not too bad.	Ani baayyee hamaa hin jiru.
She had a lot to do.	Waan baay'ee hojjechuu qabdi turte.
Before that, you need to know a few things.	Sana dura wantoota muraasa beekuu qabda.
He must be here.	Inni as jiraachuu qaba.
But this wasn’t a job.	Garuu kun hojii hin turre.
Not the worst, not the best.	Kan hamaa miti, isa gaarii miti.
It just happened one day.	Guyyaa tokko qofa ta'e.
It was only you ever.	Yoomiyyuu si qofa ture.
But some don’t.	Garuu tokko tokko hin.
She had work in the morning.	Ganama hojii qabdi turte.
Nothing could happen there.	Achitti wanti taʼuu hin dandeenye.
Mine is a little different.	Kan koo xiqqoo adda.
I never wanted to talk about it.	Waa'ee kanaa dubbachuu gonkumaa hin barbaanne.
I’m not interested in doing it right now.	Yeroo ammaa kana hojjechuuf fedhii hin qabu.
It still doesn’t exist.	Ammas hin jiru.
We weren’t working together.	Waliin hojjechaa hin turre.
I am absolutely kidding.	Ani guutummaatti qoosaa jira.
Sounds like a lot of work.	Hojii baay'ee fakkaata.
It can't be.	Ta'uu hin danda'u.
Someone has to quit, really.	Namni tokko dhiisuu qaba, dhuguma.
Everyone looks different.	Namni hundi adda adda fakkaata.
Someone had to do something.	Namni tokko waan tokko gochuu qaba ture.
I wasn’t expecting this.	Kana eegaa hin turre.
He is now teaching.	Amma barsiisaa jira.
He passed it on from his father.	Abbaa isaa irraa itti darbe.
But it’s still there.	Garuu ammallee achi jira.
I hope she is well with you.	Isheen akka gaarii siif ta'u abdiin qaba.
That’s not entirely true.	Sun guutummaatti dhugaa miti.
He saw how it could be.	Akkamitti ta'uu akka danda'u arge.
He’s just in good shape.	Inni haala gaarii qofa qaba.
Now it's mine.	Amma kan kooti.
I don't want to go back.	Duubatti deebi'uu hin barbaadu.
Very easy job to do.	Hojii baayyee salphaa ta'e hojjechuuf.
Everything is fine.	Wanti hundi gaarii dha.
Something you know she needs to do.	Waan isheen gochuu akka qabdu beektu.
Other times, not so much.	Yeroo biraa, hangas miti.
It doesn’t have a big door.	Balbala guddaa hin qabu.
A place without a good reputation.	Bakka maqaa gaarii hin qabne.
He just doesn’t look good.	Inni gaarii hin fakkaatu qofa.
They are doing it.	Gochaa jiru.
Just look at him, people with money.	Isa qofa ilaalaa, namoota maallaqa qaban.
You are going to do it.	Ati gochuuf jirta.
There, that’s better.	Achitti, sun wayya.
That's exactly what was happening.	Wanti ta'aa ture sirriitti kanuma ture.
You have a chance.	Carraan keessan jira.
He had to talk to him about that.	Waa'ee sanaa itti dubbachuu qaba ture.
About the old house.	Waa'ee mana durii sanaa.
Reluctantly, at that.	Fedhii malee, yeroo sanatti.
It is clear on this issue.	Dhimma kana irratti ifaadha.
You have to be yourself.	Of ta'uu qabda.
He said that.	Akkas jedhe.
That’s not a good reason.	Sun sababa gaarii miti.
Lots of pictures.	Suuraa baay'ee.
But we were not many people.	Garuu nuti namoota baay'ee hin turre.
I know that little girl.	Intala xiqqoo sana nan beeka.
She was going to do this.	Kana hojjechuuf turte.
I don't know how this happens.	Kana akkamitti akka ta'u hin beeku.
That works sometimes.	Sun yeroo tokko tokko ni hojjeta.
She said it could be me.	Ana ta'uu danda'a jette.
People	Namoonni .
Maybe even an accident.	Tarii balaa illee ta'uu danda'a.
We didn’t have any.	Tokkollee hin qabnu turre.
Why this happens is still unclear.	Maaliif akkas ta'u ammallee ifa miti.
That was their big thing.	Sun waan guddaa isaanii ture.
Both of us, both of us, both of us.	Nuti lamaan keenya, lamaan keenyayyuu, lamaan keenya.
But that’s not the real reason.	Garuu sababni dhugaa sun miti.
They always matter.	Yeroo hunda dhimma qabu.
She was enormous.	Isheen baayʼee guddaa turte.
I always knew this.	Yeroo hundumaa kana nan beeka ture.
So far it’s been doing fine.	Hanga ammaatti gaarii hojjechaa ture.
If you don’t, you won’t.	Yoo hin goone garuu hin gootu.
She has no children.	Ijoollee hin qabdu.
You know her, you know her.	Ati ishee beekta.
But how do you know when that will happen?.	Garuu yoom akkas ta'u akkamitti beekta?.
This is very important.	Kun baayyee barbaachisaa dha.
They are people.	Isaan namoota.
It still gets really bad for me.	Ammas dhuguma natti hamaa ta'a.
I am a mother and a daughter.	Ani haadha fi intala.
What they have is not theirs.	Wanti isaan qaban kan isaanii miti.
Not bad, just different.	Hamaa miti, adda qofa.
But it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.	Garuu dhimma hin qabu, dhimma hin qabu.
It’s something completely new.	Waan guutummaatti haaraa dha.
She certainly knows nothing.	Isheen homaa akka hin beekne beekamaadha.
She wasn't a crowd.	Isheen namoota baay'ee hin turre.
So far I have been very pleased.	Hanga ammaatti baay'een gammadeera.
She was now a hopeful wife and mother.	Amma haadha manaa fi haadha abdii qabdu turte.
You can leave comments here.	Yaada asitti dhiisuu dandeessu.
They are in good shape for the most part.	Irra caalaa haala gaarii irra jiru.
I have great hopes.	Abdii guddaa qaba.
But wait a little longer.	Garuu xiqqoo eegaa.
That is what this work did to people.	Hojiin kun namoota irratti kan godhe kanuma ture.
He didn't tell me.	Natti hin himne.
When does he say.	Yoom jedha.
She is gracious, always good to us.	Isheen tola qabdi, yeroo hunda nuuf gaarii dha.
Her occupation is probably housewife.	Hojiin ishee haadha manaa ta'uu hin oolu.
It doesn’t work without some.	Tokko tokko malee hojii hin hojjetu.
I think we all have it.	Hundi keenya qabna jedheen yaada.
I didn’t want to see any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee arguu hin barbaanne.
Something she had to go for.	Waan tokko isheen itti deemuun dirqama ta'e.
I went with him, too.	Anis isa waliin deeme.
We have a voice.	Sagalee qabna.
They are doing very well.	Baayyee gaarii hojjechaa jiru.
Then, I had no chance.	Sana booda, carraa tokkollee hin qabu ture.
But that would be the case from now on.	Garuu amma booda akkas ta'a ture.
She had only one dress.	Uffata tokko qofa qabdi turte.
But then, it really was the most special day.	Garuu sana booda, dhuguma guyyaa hunda caalaa adda ta'e ture.
It will be	Ni ta'a .
That stuff would never work.	Wanti sun gonkumaa hin hojjetu ture.
Someone who is different	Nama adda ta'e .
And again and again.	Ammas ammas.
They would have helped her now.	Silaa amma ishee gargaaru turan.
One had no money.	Tokko qarshii hin qabdu turte.
You're holding me.	Na qabaa jirta.
He wanted everything.	Waan hundumaa barbaada ture.
We needed them.	Isaan nu barbaachisa turan.
Other than him, things go little better.	Isa malee wanti biraa xiqqoo gaarii ta'ee deema.
But we can’t know each other.	Garuu wal beekuu hin dandeenyu.
This may not be a bad thing.	Kun waan hamaa taʼuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
She was my mother.	Isheen haadha koo turte.
When the	Yeroon .
I like it very much.	Baayyee natti tola.
I thought nothing of it.	Waa'ee kanaa homaa hin yaadne.
So I didn’t forgive with help.	Kanaaf gargaarsa waliin dhiifama hin goone.
You don’t need your money.	Maallaqa kee si hin barbaachisu.
But, that was about it.	Garuu, waa'ee isaa sun ture.
The one that works great.	Kan guddaa hojjetu.
Tell me what you think about that.	Waa'ee sanaa maal akka yaaddu natti himi.
I think you really love me.	Dhuguma na jaallattu natti fakkaata.
They have a spacious interior.	Keessa bal'aa qabu.
Being new in the work.	Hojii keessatti haaraa ta'uu.
He knew this was important.	Kun barbaachisaa akka taʼe beeka ture.
I couldn't even cry.	Iyyuu hin dandeenye.
Like, really really.	Akka, dhuguma dhuguma.
Not everyone is like you.	Namni hundi akka kee miti.
Tom found the girl.	Toom intala sana argate.
Very few people know this.	Kana kan beeku namoonni baayyee muraasa.
Indeed it did, here the other day.	Dhuguma ni godhe, guyyaa darbe asitti.
they may not have.	qabaachuu dhiisuu danda'u.
We are too different.	Garmalee adda taane.
I just want to get it .	Ani argachuu qofa barbaada .
He may not have any.	Tokkollee qabaachuu dhiisuu danda’a.
It was very pleasant.	Baayyee namatti tola ture.
We can’t do that.	Kana gochuu hin dandeenyu.
But not in this way.	Garuu haala kanaan miti.
I don't know exactly.	Ani sirriitti hin beeku.
People say they want to know.	Namoonni beekuu barbaadu jedhu.
He must have been watching her the whole way.	Karaa sana hunda ishee ilaalaa ture taʼuu qaba.
Look at each other.	Wal ilaalaa.
So far.	Hanga ammaatti.
Now the problem is.	Amma rakkoon.
Please, this way.	Maaloo, karaa kanaan.
Everything came from her.	Wanti hundi ishee irraa dhufe.
Everyone in school knows it.	Mana barumsaa jiru hundi ni beeka.
They are watching us.	Nu ilaalaa jiru.
But that did it.	Garuu sun godhe.
But we wanted to do something very different.	Garuu waan baayyee adda ta'e hojjechuu barbaanne.
What would she be without him.	Isa malee maaltu ishee ta'a.
He wants you all your size.	Hamma kee hunda si barbaada.
That was this morning.	Kan ganama kana ture.
It’s there, and it’s not there yet.	Achi jira, ammas hin jiru.
He looked the other way.	Karaa biraa ilaale.
I know what is real.	Waan dhugaa ta'e nan beeka.
He may not know.	Inni beekuu dhiisuu dandaʼa.
It wasn’t just another person.	Namni biraa qofa hin turre.
We thought it was a good handle.	Qabduu gaarii nutti fakkaate.
He had too much of his father in him.	Abbaa isaa garmalee of keessaa qaba ture.
It doesn’t help that much.	Akkas hin gargaaru.
Just like now.	Akkuma amma.
That’s not my issue.	Sun dhimma koo miti.
They have, like, nothing.	Isaan, akka, homaa hin qaban.
He thought he was protecting himself.	Of eegaa akka jiru itti fakkaate.
Not sure what is happening.	Waan ta'aa jiru mirkanaa'aa miti.
They can be in a matter of hours.	Sa'aatii muraasa keessatti ta'uu danda'u.
A great way to help people.	Karaa guddaa namoota gargaaruuf gargaaru.
I will never go there.	Ani gonkumaa achi hin deemu.
It looked too good to be true.	Dhugaa ta'uuf baay'ee gaarii fakkaata ture.
Not anymore.	Kana booda miti.
Like they can see in and through her.	Akkuma ishee keessa fi karaa ishee arguu danda'u.
It has all of that.	Sana hunda qaba.
I gave my real name.	Maqaa koo isa dhugaa nan kenne.
He knew he had something with him.	Waan tokko akka of biraa qabu ni beeka ture.
It was that bad.	Hamma sana hamaa ture.
They have hope.	Abdii qabu.
He must get it.	Inni argachuu qaba.
They may not do that now.	Amma akkas gochuu dhiisuu dandaʼu.
But now it doesn't exist.	Amma garuu hin jiru.
I don't know where she is.	Eessa akka jirtu hin beeku.
I can see people all the time.	Yeroo hundumaa namoota arguu nan danda'a.
I wanted to live that long.	Yeroo dheeraa sana jiraachuu barbaade.
Of course, neither is often true at all.	Yeroo baayʼee lamaan isaanii iyyuu tasumaa dhugaa akka hin taane beekamaadha.
Still nothing happened.	Ammas wanti ta'e hin jiru.
I can help you with this.	Kana irratti si gargaaruu danda'a.
It was so high.	Akkas ol ture.
I couldn’t do more.	Kana caalaa gochuu hin dandeenye.
I need more than that.	Kana caalaa na barbaachisa.
It was necessary, but such a great idea.	Barbaachisaa ture, garuu yaada guddaa akkasii.
She didn't mean it .	Jechuun ishee hin turre .
It was obvious that that didn’t matter.	Sun dhimma akka hin qabne ifa ture.
But it almost didn't happen.	Garuu hin taane jechuun ni danda'ama.
He will always be there.	Yeroo hundumaa ni jiraata.
He really likes those things.	Wantoota sana dhuguma ni jaallata.
It was all there in his eyes.	Hundi isaa ija isaa keessa achi ture.
You must come with us.	Nu waliin dhufuu qabda.
It's never going to be more accurate than it is now.	Yoomiyyuu ammaa caalaa sirrii ta'uuf hin deemu.
But that was no big deal.	Garuu sun waan guddaa hin turre.
I can't say anything now.	Amma homaa jechuu hin danda'u.
I didn’t want what he had.	Waan inni qabu hin barbaanne.
He doesn't want to be good.	Inni gaarii ta'uu hin barbaadu.
It's always like that.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas ta'a.
He loves alone time.	Yeroo kophaa isaa ni jaallata.
It can't be as good as it gets.	Hanga gaarii ta'uu hin danda'u.
You need to be more specific.	Caalaatti adda ta'uu qabda.
Then again it wouldn't work.	Sana booda ammas hin hojjetu ture.
He wants to be with you.	Inni si waliin ta'uu barbaada.
They looked human.	Nama fakkaatu turan.
I didn't think it would happen.	Ni ta'a jedhee hin yaadne.
The most obvious one.	Kan hunda caalaa ifa ta'e.
It was a dangerous job for us.	Nuuf hojii balaa qabu ture.
With the truth.	Dhugaa waliin.
Nobody knew anything.	Namni homaa hin beeku ture.
He was still curious.	Ammallee fedhii guddaa qaba ture.
It happens almost every morning.	Ganama hunda jechuun ni danda’ama ni ta’a.
They are not the same.	Isaan wal hin fakkaatu.
They don’t have to do those anymore.	Kana booda warra sana hojjechuu hin qaban.
Then again, they may not be very good.	Sana booda ammas, baay’ee gaarii ta’uu dhiisuu danda’u.
Then he gave the only answer he could.	Sana booda deebii kennuu danda’u qofa kenne.
Not once in a while.	Yeroo tokko miti.
No one understood her.	Namni ishee hubate hin jiru.
Probably better than me.	Na caalaa ta'uu hin oolu.
They would have been fine.	Silaa gaarii ta'u turan.
It’s not something new.	Waan haaraa miti.
You already have a job.	Duraan hojii qabda.
I think it's a very valid question.	Gaaffii baayyee sirrii ta'e natti fakkaata.
But it doesn't matter.	Garuu dhimma hin qabu.
No one could see through it.	Namni keessa arguu hin dandeenye.
Long and complete.	Dheeraa fi guutuu ta’e.
These are not correct.	Isaan kun sirrii miti.
Living in the here and now.	As fi amma keessa jiraachuu.
When no one else does.	Yeroo namni biraa hin goone.
This doesn’t need to be the case.	Kun akkas ta’uu hin barbaachisu.
You have to work up to it.	Hanga isaatti hojjechuu qabda.
I can't, I couldn't.	Ani hin danda'u, hin danda'u ture.
He could have lived again.	Ammas jiraachuu danda'a ture.
He was my father .	Inni abbaa koo ture .
How did it happen.	Akkamitti ta'e.
It works well now.	Amma akka gaariitti hojjeta.
You can go back again.	Ammas duubatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
What you have to say.	Waan jechuu qabdu.
But that’s not what he wants.	Garuu waan inni barbaadu kana miti.
But this is problematic.	Garuu kun rakkoo qaba.
I was really excited for this episode at the time.	Yeroo sanatti kutaa kanaaf baay'een gammade.
It may not be what you think.	Tarii waan ati yaaddu ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
He is with someone else.	Nama biraa waliin jira.
You know who knows my parents.	Warra koo beeku beekta.
I don't know if you can tell.	Himuu dandeessu hin beeku.
It’s all just emotions.	Hundi isaa miira qofa.
I thought that was an accident.	Balaa sana natti fakkaate.
They don’t even have a name.	Maqaa illee hin qaban.
You shouldn’t be doing what you’re doing.	Waan gochaa jirtu hojjechaa jiraachuu hin qabdu.
It can't exist.	Jiraachuu hin danda'u.
They are the good ones.	Isaan warra gaarii dha.
I didn’t understand the question.	Gaaffii sana hin hubanne.
We would never do it.	Yoomiyyuu hin goonu turre.
No one else should know.	Namni biraa beekuu hin qabu.
Lots of places.	Bakka baay'ee.
You already have everything in there.	Duraan waan hundumaa achi keessa qabda.
Right now this needed some doing.	Yeroo ammaa kana kun gochuu tokko tokko barbaade.
It looked like three people.	Nama sadii fakkaata ture.
It may be true	Dhugaa ta'uu danda'a .
It may be a thing of the past.	Waan darbe ta'uu danda'a.
Now this seems like a big deal.	Amma kun waan guddaa fakkaata.
They tell you what you can eat.	Waan nyaachuu akka dandeessu sitti himu.
Not the one there.	Kan achi miti.
How did that happen?.	Sun akkamitti ta'e?.
That’s part of my commitment.	Sun kutaa waadaa kooti.
I have no idea there.	Achitti yaada hin qabu.
That's what's wrong.	Kan dogoggora ta'e kanuma.
It would have never happened.	Silaa gonkumaa hin ta'u ture.
That’s not a mistake.	Sun dogoggora miti.
Never, whatever he told you.	Yoomiyyuu hin ta'u, waan inni sitti hime hunda.
I like everything.	Waan hundumaa natti tola.
I'm going there now.	Amma achi deemaa jira.
But he knew, he knew.	Garuu beeka ture, beeka ture.
That's what I mean.	Kanuma jechuu kooti.
But I don’t think she’s a threat.	Garuu isheen balaa natti hin fakkaatu.
I had no idea this could happen.	Kun ta'uu akka danda'u yaada hin qabu ture.
But that doesn't matter.	Sun garuu homaa miti.
There is an answer.	Deebii ni jira.
I don’t have a job.	Hojii hin qabu.
You're a human being.	Ati nama.
He loves you though .	Inni si jaallata garuu .
That’s always been my problem.	Yeroo hundumaa rakkoon koo kanuma ture.
That's pretty obvious.	Sun baayyee ifaadha.
I really mean that.	Dhuguma akkas jechuu kooti.
I think this is a great idea.	Kun yaada guddaa natti fakkaata.
He did that for us.	Inni akkas nuuf godhe.
But this is not a good time.	Garuu yeroon kun yeroo gaarii miti.
Like every other year.	Akkuma waggaa biraa.
Your favorite place and person.	Bakka fi nama jaallattu.
But this didn’t work.	Garuu kun hin hojjenne.
There must be time.	Yeroon jiraachuu qaba.
We are all in this room.	Hundi keenya kutaa kana keessa jirra.
He wondered where this could be.	Kun eessa ta'uu danda'a jedhee yaade.
I'd rather not know.	Osoo hin beekne naaf wayya.
She should have seen it coming.	Silaa dhufuu isaa arguu qabdi turte.
It's the right way.	Karaa sirrii ta'e.
But we wanted to go further.	Garuu kana caalaa deemuu barbaanne.
It looked very long.	Baayyee dheeraa fakkaata ture.
We need to be willing.	Fedhii qabaachuu qabna.
They were old friends.	Hiriyyoota durii turan.
That's exactly how it might be.	Sirriitti akkas ta'uu danda'a.
It was nothing.	Homaa hin turre.
Maybe that's all.	Tarii kana qofa ta'uu danda'a.
When she is not there.	Yeroo isheen hin jirre.
But, then again, maybe not.	Garuu, sana booda ammas, tarii hin ta'u.
I knew nothing about fatherhood.	Waa'ee abbaa ta'uu homaa hin beeku ture.
Maybe we still are.	Tarii ammallee jirra ta'a.
You know, that sort of thing.	Beektaa, waan akkasii.
Perhaps they still do.	Tarii amma iyyuu ni godhu taʼa.
That didn’t seem so bad.	Sun akkas hamaa hin fakkaatu ture.
That’s all we need to know.	Kana qofa beekuu qabnu.
I couldn't tell him any more.	Kana caalaa itti himuu hin dandeenye.
It wasn’t too good.	Garmalee gaarii hin turre.
I know my place.	Bakka koo nan beeka.
It really wasn’t.	Dhuguma hin turre.
I have little issues now.	Amma dhimma xiqqoo qaba.
It was deserted now, no one there at all.	Amma namni hin jirre ture, tasumaa achitti namni tokkollee hin jiru.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Tarii akkas jedhee hin yaadu ta'a.
That is the reality.	Wanti dhugaa jiru kanuma.
Few people.	Namoonni muraasa.
I don't know what that is.	Sun maal akka ta'e hin beeku.
It really is a very good school.	Dhuguma mana barumsaa baayyee gaarii dha.
You should never give up on any of them.	Isaan keessaa tokkollee gonkumaa harka kennuu hin qabdu.
I don't want to talk to him.	Ani itti dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
They’re not exactly wrong.	Isaan sirriitti dogoggora miti.
He just didn’t do anything.	Homaa hin goone qofa.
Now he was deserted.	Amma nama malee ture.
But it wasn’t like that.	Garuu akkas hin turre.
You may be the lucky one.	Ati kan carraa qabu ta'uu dandeessa.
She was going to work her way.	Isheen karaa ishee hojjechuuf turte.
Everything goes smoothly.	Wanti hundi sirriitti deema.
I certainly enjoyed hers.	Kan ishee akkan itti gammade beekamaadha.
They were always there.	Yeroo hundumaa achi turan.
You are on my way.	Ati karaa koo irra jirta.
And I just sit there.	Anis taa'a qofa.
We all have to go.	Hundi keenya deemuu qabna.
I don't know how to be clearer.	Kana caalaa akkamitti akkan ifa ta'u hin beeku.
That’s all you can do in this situation.	Haala kana keessatti gochuu dandeessu kana qofa.
But there was work.	Garuu hojiin ni ture.
People who are extremely opinionated.	Namoota garmalee yaada qaban.
They tell me this is an important opportunity.	Kun carraa barbaachisaa akka ta’e natti himu.
It means your opinion.	Yaada keessan jechuu dha.
You can make some serious money.	Maallaqa guddaa tokko tokko argachuu dandeessa.
But that doesn’t really work.	Garuu sun dhuguma hin hojjetu.
I thought that was great.	Sun waan guddaa natti fakkaate.
He asked me for an opinion.	Yaada na gaafate.
It worked well in both of those.	Isaan lamaan sana keessatti akka gaariitti hojjete.
Not that anyone noticed.	Namni tokkollee akka hubate miti.
He got a hand.	Harka tokko argate.
But it’s inside of him.	Garuu keessa isaa jira.
She must be there for him.	Isheen isaaf ta'uu qabdi.
We hope it helps.	Akka gargaaru abdii qabna.
He didn’t go to school.	Mana barumsaa hin deemne.
It all started here.	Hundi kan jalqabe asitti ture.
Only the dog knows the real answer.	Deebii dhugaa kan beeku saree qofa.
But it still doesn’t work.	Garuu ammallee hin hojjetu.
You are still my daughter.	Ati ammallee intala kooti.
That’s how I know.	Akkasitti beeka.
There we were, just the two of us, with no one around.	Achi turre, nu lamaan qofa, nama naannoo keenya hin jirre.
I never understood it.	Ani gonkumaa naaf hin galle.
But no one else is doing this.	Garuu namni biraa kana gochaa hin jiru.
He loves his job.	Hojii isaa ni jaallata.
Sometimes this is an important answer.	Yeroo tokko tokko kun deebii barbaachisaa dha.
We just can’t do anything.	Homaa gochuu qofa hin dandeenyu.
Indeed, it does.	Dhuguma, qaba.
I want to live, that’s all.	Jiraachuu barbaada, kana qofa.
He was outside just a little while ago.	Yeroo xiqqoo dura qofa ala ture.
He was a terrible accident.	Inni balaa hamaa ture.
For a while nothing seemed to happen.	Yeroo muraasaaf wanti ta'u hin fakkaatu ture.
You need to know something.	Waan tokko beekuu qabda.
He was one year old.	Umuriin isaa waggaa tokko ture.
He began his work.	Hojii isaa jalqabe.
This cannot be true.	Kun dhugaa ta'uu hin danda'u.
Nothing, nothing .	Homaa, homaa hin jiru .
Still no one came.	Ammas namni dhufe hin jiru.
That wasn’t always the case.	Yeroo hundumaa akkas hin turre.
But sometimes inevitable.	Garuu yeroo tokko tokko kan hin oolle.
But it’s still good.	Garuu ammas gaarii dha.
Maybe things are not so different here.	Tarii asitti wanti akkas adda ta'uu dhiisuu danda'a.
That’s a mistake.	Sun dogoggora.
They should know you.	Si beekuu qabu.
Today and tomorrow are two such days.	Har'a fi boru guyyaa akkasii lama.
I can't be with you.	Si waliin ta'uu hin danda'u.
I wish it wasn’t.	Osoo hin taane natti tola.
He loves you so much.	Baay'ee si jaallata.
What he says.	Waan inni jedhu.
She really was something.	Dhuguma waan tokko turte.
There is no problem with them.	Isaan waliin rakkoon hin jiru.
If it is wrong .	Yoo dogoggora ta'e .
This is not true in all cases.	Kun haala hunda keessatti dhugaa miti.
In the house.	Mana keessa.
Many of us couldn't do that.	Baay'een keenya akkas gochuu hin dandeenye.
I mean everyone.	Nama hunda jechuu kooti.
Now you can go home.	Amma gara manaatti deebi'uu dandeessa.
He was all alone.	Inni hundi kophaa isaa ture.
I want you to do this.	Kana akka gootu nan barbaada.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.	Xiqqoo kana, xiqqoo sana.
He took everything.	Waan hundumaa fudhate.
Hour after hour, still not enough.	Sa'aatii sa'aatii, ammas gahaa miti.
So you can do all of that.	Kanaaf sana hunda gochuu dandeessa.
You can believe it.	Amanuu dandeessu.
I would have sat at the bar.	Silaa mana dhugaatii sana taa'a ture.
You can always do something new.	Yeroo hundumaa waan haaraa hojjechuu dandeessa.
That was a long time ago.	Sun yeroo dheeraa dura ture.
Nothing is so obvious.	Wanti akkas ifa ta'e hin jiru.
They were your friends.	Isaan hiriyyoota kee turan.
This was a simple fact.	Kun dhugaa salphaa ture.
I had said, 'It's not.	jedheen ture.
I can never do this here.	Kana asitti gonkumaa gochuu hin danda'u.
My luck was in it.	Carraan koo keessa ture.
They should have done that.	Silaa akkas gochuu qabu turan.
I have a real problem with that.	Sana irratti rakkoo dhugaa qaba.
No one seemed to be there.	Namni tokkollee waan hin jirre fakkaata ture.
I think it's bright enough for my eyes at night.	Halkan ija kootti ifa gahaa natti fakkaata.
I’m really excited.	Dhuguma gammadeera.
Very, very happy about that.	Baayyee baayyee gammadeera waa'ee sanaa.
Now he had only one question, it was a simple one.	Amma gaaffii tokko qofa qaba ture, gaaffii salphaa ture.
No one was even around her.	Namni naannoo ishee illee hin turre.
Today, however, is different.	Har'a garuu adda.
Not all of them have met yet.	Hundi isaanii hanga ammaatti wal hin argine.
I'm here this morning.	Har'a ganama as jira.
But you had to do it that way.	Ati garuu akkasitti gochuu qabda turte.
Sometimes they do both.	Yeroo tokko tokko lamaan isaaniiyyuu ni godhu.
I haven’t had one in a while.	Yeroo muraasaaf tokko hin qabu ture.
We are all human beings.	Hundi keenya nama.
I don't want to talk to you.	Si waliin dubbachuu hin barbaadu.
Maybe he couldn't say anything.	Tarii homaa dubbachuu hin dandeenye ta'a.
Certainly not anymore.	Kana booda akka hin taane beekamaadha.
It was very dangerous.	Baayyee balaa qaba ture.
It was a joke.	Qoosaa ture.
Maybe more than that.	Tarii kana caalaa ta'uu danda'a.
Then he thought about what she had said.	Sana booda waan isheen jette itti yaade.
I don't want to live without you.	Si malee jiraachuu hin barbaadu.
And yet, many of them are the same.	Ammas ta'ee, baay'een isaanii kanuma.
That was the time.	Yeroon sun akkas ture.
This one might be different though.	Inni kun garuu adda ta'uu danda'a.
I absolutely love him some.	Ani guutummaatti isa tokko tokko nan jaalladha.
We are the same people.	Nuti namoota tokko.
But at the time.	Garuu yeroo sanatti.
It was his feelings.	Miira isaa ture.
Not without you.	Si malee miti.
Which is absolutely true.	Kan guutummaatti dhugaa ta'e.
So, we did that.	Kanaaf, akkas goone.
I don't want to make a new one.	Haaraa gochuu hin barbaadu.
But, it was nothing.	Garuu, homaa hin turre.
You can buy food at the snack bar.	Mana nyaata salphaa sanatti nyaata bitachuu dandeessu.
That’s what we’re going to do.	Kanuma gochuuf jirra.
It was just desire.	Fedhii qofa ture.
He loves to play.	Taphachuu ni jaallata.
You can’t do everything but you can do something.	Waan hundumaa gochuu hin dandeessu garuu waan tokko gochuu dandeessa.
I didn’t have any of it.	Ani tokkollee hin qabu ture.
I think this is a good thing.	Kun waan gaarii natti fakkaata.
What can anyone say.	Namni maal jechuu danda'a.
They all know this fact.	Hundi isaanii dhugaa kana ni beeku.
Almost no one else is there.	Namni biraa tokkollee hin jiru jechuun ni danda'ama.
I didn’t realize it would help that much.	Hamma kana akka gargaaru hin hubanne.
Obviously she was.	Isheen akka turte ifaadha.
He is a very good dog.	Inni saree baayyee gaarii dha.
He had a lot of money.	Maallaqa baay'ee qaba ture.
It wasn’t like that at all.	Tasumaa akkas hin turre.
It didn’t seem to matter anymore.	Kana booda waan dhimma qabu hin fakkaatu ture.
I don't know whether to speak or not.	Dubbachuu fi dhiisuu hin beeku.
He did so at that time.	Yeroo sanatti akkas godhe.
I didn’t want to be in his way.	Karaa isaa keessa jiraachuu hin barbaanne.
It wasn’t in my room.	Kutaa koo keessa hin turre.
What's going to happen.	Maal ta'a.
Nothing more is going to happen with him.	Kana caalaa wanti isa waliin ta'uuf hin jiru.
All she had to do was be herself.	Wanti isheen gochuu qabdu of ta'uu qofa ture.
She was really really nice.	Dhuguma dhuguma namatti tola turte.
When he wanted it.	Yeroo barbaade.
Sometimes it doesn't matter.	Yeroo tokko tokko homaa hin ta'u.
All we have to do is find it.	Wanti nuti gochuu qabnu argachuu qofa.
A lot of problems nowadays.	Rakkoo baay'ee yeroo ammaa.
It wasn’t a driveway.	Karaa konkolaataa hin turre.
I go to work.	Hojii nan deema.
About almost everything.	Waa'ee waan hundumaa jechuun ni danda'ama.
They had the worst.	Hamaa qaban turan.
No one else does.	Namni biraa hin godhu.
We are alone here.	Asitti kophaa keenya jirra.
I want to know what you did.	Waan ati goote beekuu barbaada.
I like it very much.	Baayyee natti tola.
Nothing is happening.	Wanti ta'aa jiru hin jiru.
But that is not necessarily the case.	Garuu dirqama akkas miti.
There is a problem.	Rakkoon jira.
It was wrong to do so.	Akkasitti gochuun dogoggora ture.
Yelling a lot.	Iyyuu baay'ee.
It should have been enough.	Silaa gahaa ta'uu qaba ture.
You have to get it from somewhere.	Bakka tokko irraa argachuu qabda.
But you don't.	Ati garuu hin gootu.
Not more than once.	Yeroo tokko caalaa miti.
I couldn't see him.	Isa arguu hin dandeenye.
What to do when you don’t know what to do.	Maal gochuu qabda yeroo maal gootu hin beekne.
He thinks about it, but not for long.	Inni itti yaada malee yeroo dheeraaf miti.
There was no one to help me.	Namni na gargaaru hin turre.
