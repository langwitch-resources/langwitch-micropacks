That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And they were.	Kandi bari.
I was just thinking.	Natekerezaga gusa.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
If it were my advice.	Iyo yaba inama yanjye.
In fact, he is not a very good guy.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo ari umusore mwiza cyane.
She can eat normally.	Arashobora kurya bisanzwe.
But he was too young.	Ariko yari muto cyane.
They were one and the same, he chose.	Bari umwe kandi umwe, yahisemo.
We cannot know who he is or who he is.	Ntidushobora kumenya uwo ari we cyangwa uwo ari we.
You can't say it's bad.	Ntushobora kuvuga ko ari mubi.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
You have to win.	Ugomba gutsinda.
I'm glad you can find the time.	Nishimiye ko ushobora kubona umwanya.
He did not know where.	Ntabwo yari azi aho.
He thought to himself.	Yatekerezaga wenyine.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza wenyine.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
He was still alone.	Yari akiri wenyine.
He has a dog.	Afite imbwa.
But he knows nothing.	Ariko nta na kimwe azi.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
He could do everything he could.	Ibyo yashoboraga gukora byose.
That was a great thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza cyane.
No one had money.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite amafaranga.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I would do it.	Nari kubikora.
I really want to be with her.	Ndashaka kubana na we cyane.
He felt he was well prepared for this.	Yumvise yiteguye neza ibi.
He is working on his book.	Arimo gukora igitabo cye.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
My daughter would be there too.	Umukobwa wanjye na we yaba ahari.
She is not his wife.	Ntabwo ari umugore we.
I hope he has.	Ndizera ko afite.
She's scared!	Afite ubwoba!
The house was absolutely beautiful.	Inzu yari nziza rwose.
Or a bad guy.	Cyangwa umusore mubi.
This one had been around for a long time.	Uyu yari amaze igihe kinini.
He said it was not for long.	Yavuze ko atari mu gihe gito.
This or that.	Ibi cyangwa ntacyo.
He saw his father on the phone.	Yabonye se kuri terefone.
You can't be alone.	Ntushobora kuba wenyine.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
And if he had.	Niba kandi yari afite.
You may be right.	Urashobora kuba ufite ukuri.
It's not here for me.	Ntabwo ari hano kuri njye.
The problem is, we were.	Ikibazo nuko, twari twe.
You can't tell someone.	Ntushobora kubwira umuntu.
We have to get out of this world.	Tugomba kuva kuri iyi si.
This is great and easy.	Ibi nibyiza cyane kandi byoroshye.
He wants to talk about his time.	Arashaka kuvuga umwanya we.
This would be great.	Ibi byaba byiza.
He goes home to live.	Agiye murugo kubana.
Or you can have anything.	Cyangwa ushobora kugira ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
She feels she needs more.	Yumva ko akeneye byinshi.
You are a young man.	Uri umusore.
I'm here to stay.	Ndi hano kuguma.
That's it!	Ubu ni bwo!.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
It is not always easy.	Ntabwo rwose ari ibintu byoroshye.
That's not the case now.	Ntabwo aribyo ubu.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni cyo kibazo.
You can't think.	Ntushobora gutekereza.
You can see anything.	Urashobora kubona ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I saw that he was not.	Nabonye atari we.
He says this is very good.	Avuga ko ibi ari byiza cyane.
But he didn't have a phone.	Ariko ntabwo yari afite terefone.
He did not know when.	Ntiyari azi igihe icyo ari cyo.
So far, no.	Kugeza ubu, ntabwo.
We are ashamed.	Dufite isoni.
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
I can't say right now.	Sinshobora kuvuga ubu.
In fact, it is all.	Mubyukuri, byose ni.
He was on my side at the time.	Icyo gihe yari kuri njye.
Or for both.	Cyangwa kuri bombi.
This is like a movie for me.	Ibi ni nka firime kuri njye.
They are just children.	Ni abana gusa.
It was not too far.	Ntabwo byari kure cyane.
Going home one girl every night is great.	Kujya murugo umukobwa umwe buri joro nibyiza cyane.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
Now I know what it is.	Ubu nzi icyo aricyo.
He left early in the morning.	Yagiye kare mu gitondo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
Why do you want to do this?	Kuki ushaka gukora ibi?
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
Not you either.	Ntabwo nawe.
You can be.	Urashobora kuba.
The teacher asked a question.	Umwarimu yabajije ikibazo.
That's what my friend told me.	Nibyo inshuti yanjye yambwiye.
He knows a lot about movies.	Azi byinshi kuri firime.
He thought about it for a long time.	Yatekereje kuri icyo kibazo igihe kirekire.
And he is not here.	Kandi ntabwo ari hano.
A lot to do here.	Byinshi byo gukora hano.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ibyo byose ni ukuri.
No problem watching.	Nta kibazo cyo kureba.
He did not do well.	Ntabwo yakoze neza.
And I have a job.	Kandi mfite akazi.
I would like a party.	Ndashaka ibirori.
It's not good at all.	Ntabwo ari mwiza na gato.
He has no reason.	Nta mpamvu afite.
He may have gone home.	Ashobora kuba yari yagiye murugo.
Did you say anything	Hari icyo wavuze?
I just don't know what to do first.	Gusa sinzi icyo gukora mbere.
I really want them to live here.	Ndashaka rwose ko aba hano.
Doing something.	Gukora ikintu.
He would have gone.	Yaba yagiye.
There is a lot to come.	Hariho byinshi byo kuza.
You have to go now.	Ugomba kugenda nonaha.
Or an idea.	Cyangwa igitekerezo.
And he wouldn't even tell me before.	Kandi ntiyari no kumbwira mbere.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
It's not over.	Ntabwo ari hejuru.
.	.
Tomorrow will be better than today, that's for sure.	Ejo bizaba byiza kurenza uyumunsi, nibyo rwose.
The book is a gift.	Igitabo ni impano.
Great time with him.	Igihe kinini hamwe na we.
One more thing.	Ikindi kintu kimwe.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
The teacher seemed happy to pick up the phone.	Umwarimu yasaga naho yishimiye gufata terefone.
What we need to do more.	Ibyo dukeneye gukora cyane.
He said quickly.	Yavuze vuba.
The problems are many.	Ibibazo ni byinshi.
He is smart.	Afite ubwenge.
He needs to do things.	Akeneye gukora ibintu.
He saw that he was right.	Yabonye ko afite ukuri.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
You don’t have to study.	Ntabwo ugomba kwiga.
But here's something he can't do.	Ariko hano hari ikintu adashobora kugenda.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
He is not one of us.	Ntabwo ari umwe muri twe.
Do you have an idea ?.	Waba ufite igitekerezo?.
I thought maybe he was inside.	Natekereje ko ahari yari imbere.
If not, most people would.	Niba atari byo, abantu benshi bari kubikora.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
That's exactly what he wanted.	Nibyo rwose yashakaga.
And this is not just money.	Kandi ibi ntabwo ari amafaranga gusa.
They know where we are.	Bazi aho turi.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
Or anything from the beginning.	Cyangwa ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose kuva mbere.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
I am looking for a friend.	Ndashaka inshuti.
I know it's great.	Nzi ko ari byiza cyane.
I'm not around.	Ntabwo ndi hafi yanjye.
He had been away for a while.	Yari amaze igihe gito.
You can even say something.	Urashobora no kuvuga ikintu.
This is exactly what his father wanted.	Ibi nibyo rwose se yashakaga.
No one was present.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze ahari.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
But now we are.	Ariko ubu turi.
But he is scared.	Ariko afite ubwoba.
You need to go.	Ukeneye kugenda.
It was where it should have been.	Yari aho yagombaga kuba.
Of course he hadn't gone alone.	Ni ukuri ntabwo yari yagiye wenyine.
But before we do anything else, we have to eat.	Ariko mbere yo gukora ikindi kintu cyose, tugomba kugira icyo kurya.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yagize.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
Eventually he got help.	Amaherezo yaje kubona ubufasha.
My car was gone.	Imodoka yanjye yari yagiye.
Nothing less.	Nta kintu gito.
That's great.	Nibyo byiza cyane.
I'm not happy about that, obviously.	Ntabwo nishimiye ibi, biragaragara.
And at the time, it was a good idea.	Kandi icyo gihe, byari igitekerezo cyiza.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
But he knows he can't.	Ariko azi ko adashobora.
I felt bad for the family.	Numvise nabi umuryango.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
He tried to think clearly.	Yagerageje gutekereza neza.
I knew my wife.	Nari nzi umugore wanjye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Her clothes were beautiful.	Imyenda ye yari nziza.
It wasn't as if he really wanted to see one of them.	Ntabwo byari nkaho ashaka rwose kubona kimwe muri byo.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
I know this is not what you want to hear.	Nzi ko ibi atari byo ushaka kumva.
I want to say more.	Ndashaka kuvuga byinshi.
It was a beautiful day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza cyane.
I am looking for a girl.	Ndashaka umukobwa.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
I knew it was true.	Nari nzi ko mubyukuri.
That was it.	Icyo yari cyo.
But, well, well.	Ariko, neza.
We have nothing.	Ntacyo dufite.
I knew it all the time.	Nari nzi igihe cyose.
To see	Kubona.
You never did.	Ntabwo wigeze ukora.
She wanted to be with you.	Yashakaga kubana nawe.
Obviously not much.	Biragaragara ko atari byinshi.
He is.	Niwe.
You have to be.	Ugomba kuba.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
It was a thing.	Byari ibintu.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
You know everything, but you know for sure.	Uzi ibintu byose, ariko uzi neza ko ntacyo.
But they were.	Ariko bari.
I know he is.	Nzi ko ari we.
You are moving too fast.	Urimo kugenda vuba cyane.
No one is involved.	Nta muntu urimo.
Or for me.	Cyangwa kuri njye.
He says nothing wrong with anyone.	Nta kintu kibi avuga ku muntu.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko ari ukuri.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I doubt you have much money alone.	Ndashidikanya ko ufite amafaranga menshi wenyine.
It's really good.	Mubyukuri ni byiza.
I can't say right now.	Sinshobora kuvuga nonaha.
She is his wife.	Ni umugore we.
Talk to you soon.	Kuvugana nawe.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I knew it well enough.	Nari nzi neza bihagije.
She was a woman.	Yari umugore.
And that would be it.	Kandi ibyo byaba.
In fact, you might be wondering.	Mubyukuri, waba utekereza neza.
Good question.	Ikibazo cyiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Woman.	Umugore.
Her youngest child.	Umwana we muto.
And it's good.	Kandi ni mwiza.
I'm glad he finally did something at home.	Nishimiye ko amaherezo yakoze ikintu murugo.
That you do this.	Ko ukora ibi.
But what I mean is that you now have friends.	Ariko icyo nshaka kuvuga nuko ubu ufite inshuti.
But! 	Ariko!
in the end.	amaherezo.
Are you studying?	Urimo kwiga?
But you are also human.	Ariko nawe uri umuntu.
I am a friend.	Ndi inshuti.
He has to figure out what the problem is.	Agomba kumenya ikibazo icyo ari cyo.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
I thought you did the same.	Natekereje ko nawe wabikoze.
He says money.	Avuga ko amafaranga.
He does nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora.
He was his father.	Yari se.
He heard something.	Hari ikintu yumvise.
They probably know where he went.	Birashoboka ko bazi aho yagiye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's the same with you.	Ni kimwe nawe.
I think they knew nothing.	Ntekereza ko ntacyo bari bazi.
He had to do something, but there was nothing good to do.	Yagombaga kugira icyo akora, ariko nta kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I don't want to go.	Ntashaka kugenda.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
I am very happy to do so.	Nishimiye cyane kubikora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He is a bad boy.	Ni umuhungu mubi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
I haven't seen anything yet.	Ntacyo nabonye kuri ubu.
I can't have it.	Sinshobora kugira.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
More and more.	Byinshi kandi byinshi.
If you like that, that's fine.	Niba ukunda ibyo, nibyiza.
This will not be good.	Ibi ntabwo bizaba byiza.
You are a smart girl.	Uri umukobwa uzi ubwenge.
The truth is very possible.	Ukuri birashoboka cyane.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
I was thinking about that.	Natekerezaga kuri ibyo.
And he can.	Kandi arashobora.
What he did say was that he had to do what he liked.	Icyo yari yavuze ni uko agomba gukora ibyo akunda.
You don't have to be an expert.	Ntugomba kuba umuhanga.
He was scared, but he had faith.	Yari afite ubwoba, ariko yari afite kwizera.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko turi benshi cyane.
He said you look good.	Yavuze ko usa neza.
You don't have one.	Ntabwo ufite.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
Anything.	Ikintu cyose.
He was the only one who did it.	Ni we wenyine wabikoze.
But that's exactly what happened later.	Ariko ibyo mubyukuri nyuma.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
No one did it.	Nta n'umwe wabikoze.
I have enough of that!	Mfite ibyo bihagije!
I feel it every day.	Numva buri munsi.
They were one and the same person.	Bari umuntu umwe kandi umwe.
He doesn't like it.	Nta byo akunda.
That's a good thing.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza.
We need more.	Dukeneye byinshi.
I am working hard.	Ndimo gukora cyane.
She was also a working girl.	Na we yari umukobwa ukora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Not many things you have.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byinshi ufite.
Nothing good.	Nta cyiza.
What is it today.	Ni iki muri iki gihe.
Well, that's not a big deal.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
It wasn't you.	Ntabwo wari wowe.
For him, you have to help.	Kuri we, ugomba gufasha.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Nishimiye ko uri hano hamwe nanjye.
You can go with what you want.	Urashobora kujyana nibyo ushaka.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
He did it sometimes.	Yakoze rimwe na rimwe.
He thought of her.	Yatekereje kuri we.
I know.	Nzi kumenya.
I feel like that was probably the best thing ever.	Ndumva ibyo bishoboka ko byari byiza cyane.
And he was not worried.	Kandi ntabwo yari afite impungenge.
But he knew in that look that he had failed.	Ariko yari azi ko atari byo.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
His family was good to him.	Umuryango we wari mwiza kuri we.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
Nothing good or bad.	Nta kintu cyiza cyangwa kibi.
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
They are good friends.	Ni inshuti nziza.
I guess we have to think.	Ndakeka ko tugomba gutekereza.
I love the baby.	Nkunda umwana.
I know he is right.	Nzi ko afite ukuri.
That was a concern.	Ibyo byari impungenge.
I am always scared.	Mfite ubwoba buri gihe.
He did not want to go back.	Ntiyashakaga gusubira inyuma.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
It is neither now nor ever.	Ntabwo ari ubu cyangwa nta na rimwe.
But it went wrong.	Ariko byagenze nabi.
They had no "opinion" on the matter.	Ntabwo bari bafite "igitekerezo" kuri iki kibazo.
Not enough for.	Ntabwo bihagije kuri.
Perhaps, he had gone too far.	Ahari, yari yagiye kure cyane.
He wanted to be both.	Yashakaga kuba bombi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
Or the same.	Cyangwa kimwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He just asked questions.	Yabajije ibibazo gusa.
It was a wonderful day.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane.
Do they have money?	Bafite amafaranga?
He never did anything else.	Ntiyigeze akora ikindi kintu.
Eventually, he came to terms with it.	Amaherezo, yaje kuvugana.
I'm scared.	Ndi ubwoba.
What is my favorite book?	Igitabo nkunda cyane ni iki.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba gukora neza.
It was great right now.	Byari byiza kuri ubu.
He could do everything.	Yashoboraga byose.
He is not sure if he can do it.	Ntabwo rwose azi neza ko ashobora kubikora.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
But he never did anything.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
I'm sure I am.	Nzi neza ko ndi.
But there is no turning back.	Ariko nta gusubira inyuma.
And of all.	Kandi muri bose.
Everything is fine then.	Byose ni byiza icyo gihe.
She is OK.	Afite neza.
This is you for me, and for me.	Uyu ni wowe kuri njye, nanjye kuri we.
There is also food.	Hariho kandi ibiryo.
I know it's just a problem.	Nzi ko ari ikibazo gusa.
.	.
Little did he know that.	Ntiyari azi ko aribyo.
Well if you don't want to talk.	Nibyiza niba udashaka kuvuga.
He may be there for a long time.	Ashobora kuba ahari igihe kirekire.
He is working hard.	Arimo gukora cyane.
I don't need to read anything.	Ntabwo nkeneye gusoma ikintu na kimwe.
But he really was.	Ariko rwose yari we.
I didn't get my phone.	Ntabwo nabonye terefone yanjye.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
Looks like you're doing really well.	Birasa nkaho ukora neza rwose.
He was looking for a house.	Yashakaga inzu.
He thought it was not then.	Yatekereje ko atari icyo gihe.
It was not my fault.	Ntabwo byari amakosa yanjye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I need clothes.	Nkeneye imyenda.
But he seems to be the only one for me.	Ariko asa naho ari wenyine kuri njye.
It was easy.	Byari ibintu byoroshye.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
He was not going to do it.	Ntabwo yari agiye kubikora.
That is good and good.	Ibyo nibyiza kandi byiza.
Time to do something.	Igihe cyo gukora ikintu.
But I can't.	Ariko ntashobora.
Just not today.	Gusa si uyu munsi.
He was not worried.	Ntabwo yari afite impungenge.
He wanted to go to school.	Yashakaga kujya ku ishuri.
Or 'just'.	Cyangwa 'gusa'.
I'm going to do something good.	Ngiye gukora ikintu cyiza.
He thought he could help.	Yatekereje ko ashobora gufasha.
I like to read.	Nkunda gusoma.
Everyone has this.	Umuntu wese afite ibi.
And that's not always a bad thing.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo bisanzwe ikintu kibi.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibyo ni mubyukuri.
We must all work together.	Tugomba gukora twese hamwe.
However, you saw nothing.	Ariko, nta na kimwe wabonye.
You don't know what to do.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo gukora.
But that's right.	Ariko nibyo.
The opportunity to hear.	Amahirwe yo kumva.
But nothing good.	Ariko nta cyiza.
Every child in this world should study well.	Umwana wese kuri iyi si akwiye kwiga neza.
But it is easier to say than to do.	Ariko byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
Very high.	Hejuru cyane.
However, that was not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
I didn’t want to let anyone down.	Sinifuzaga kureka umuntu uwo ari we wese.
What? 	Niki?
he said.	yavuze.
This is also good.	Ibi kandi ni byiza.
But it was a lot.	Ariko byari byinshi.
I mean, that's exactly what he said.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko aribyo yavuze yatekereje.
I mean, a lot of money.	Ndashaka kuvuga, amafaranga menshi.
Ahari.	Ahari.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
He didn’t have much to look at.	Ntabwo yari afite ibintu byinshi byo kureba.
I don't want to hear.	Sinshaka kumva.
I shouldn't have come here.	Sinari nkwiye kuza hano.
It’s a job, it’s a job.	Ni akazi, ni akazi.
He was still very far away.	Yari akiri kure cyane.
In fact the fear is ‘now’.	Mubyukuri ubwoba ni 'ubu'.
We have to have a reason.	Tugomba kugira impamvu.
And he can.	Kandi arashobora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
I should help with that.	Nkwiye gufasha muri ibyo.
Maybe you could try something else.	Ahari ushobora kugerageza ikindi kintu.
I don't want to be friends with you.	Sinshaka kuba inshuti nawe.
I'm not going later.	Ntabwo ngiye nyuma.
I'm sure everyone does.	Nzi neza ko buri muntu abikora.
I'm thinking of getting a job here.	Ndatekereza gufata akazi hano.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It's not about being together.	Ntabwo ari kubana.
I don't know them all.	Sinzi bose.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
There is.	Hariho.
That is very clear.	Ibyo biragaragara cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I need help.	Nkeneye ubufasha.
He said he has no problem drinking.	Yavuze ko nta kibazo cyo kunywa afite.
She knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko ari mwiza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It's normal. 	Ni ibintu bisanzwe.
'	'
Things we have.	Ibintu dufite.
We have to play well here.	Tugomba gukina neza hano.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It's just the same.	Ni kimwe gusa.
He is glad that he did not do so.	Yishimiye ko atabikoze.
It is not a problem for us to stay outside.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri twe kuguma hanze.
He could say nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kuvuga.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Man per day.	Umuntu ku munsi.
You have to do it quickly.	Ugomba kubikora vuba.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
We have to.	Tugomba.
And when it does go wrong.	Kandi iyo byagenze nabi.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
I think he is here.	Ndatekereza ko ari hano.
No one, really, but especially him.	Nta muntu n'umwe, mubyukuri, ariko cyane cyane we.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
I am the only one who has a house.	Ninjye wenyine ufite inzu.
He was just a young man.	Yari umusore gusa.
The car looked good.	Imodoka yasaga neza.
No one has anything.	Nta muntu ufite ikintu.
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
And to me.	Kandi ku.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
And for no reason.	Kandi nta mpamvu.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Sometimes, you can't win.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntushobora gutsinda.
Very low.	Hasi cyane.
He doesn't need to.	Ntabwo akeneye.
Every day is a gift.	Buri munsi ni impano.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
That's very difficult.	Nibyo bigoye cyane.
Not really far away.	Ntabwo rwose ari kure.
He didn't really need it.	Ntabwo yari akeneye rwose.
He made a mistake.	Yakoze amakosa.
Tonight, however, he seemed worried.	Iri joro ariko, yasaga naho afite impungenge.
Here is a book.	Hano hari igitabo.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He did.	Yabikoze.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
There is another problem.	Hariho ikindi kibazo.
I think he may have my youngest child.	Ndatekereza ko ashobora kuba afite umwana wanjye muto.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
I found it to be true.	Nabonye ko ari ukuri.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Nzi neza ko bizaba byiza.
They are many.	Ni benshi.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
Good girl!	Umukobwa mwiza!
We were very high on that.	Twari hejuru cyane kuri ibyo.
I like to help.	Nkunda gufasha.
That is not true at all.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri rwose.
Before you act, you must read this.	Mbere yo kugira icyo ukora, ugomba gusoma ibi.
I never did anything.	Sinigeze nkora ikintu na kimwe.
It was not a chance.	Ntabwo byari amahirwe.
I can do the same thing.	Nshobora gukora ikintu kimwe.
But that was good enough.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza bihagije.
I can go now.	Nshobora kugenda ubu.
I want to do things right.	Ndashaka gukora ibintu neza.
I think it's me though.	Ntekereza ko ari njye ariko.
It is very good and very good.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byiza rwose.
Everything went well until morning.	Byose byagenze neza kugeza mu gitondo.
And he wanted to do something.	Kandi yashakaga kugira icyo akora.
He had each of those.	Yari afite buri kimwe muri ibyo.
I wondered what to do.	Natekereje icyo gukora.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
Finding something you think is good.	Kubona ikintu utekereza ko ari cyiza.
It was yesterday.	Yari ejo.
It's not hard to do.	Ntabwo bigoye gukora.
The only problem is 'time'.	Ikibazo gusa ni 'igihe'.
People are here.	Abantu ni hano.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
Of course we do.	Nukuri natwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
To be like.	Kuba nka.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
I ask questions.	Ndabaza ibibazo.
There is more to it.	Hariho byinshi kuri byo.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
And you are.	Kandi uri.
Neither of us needed it.	Ntabwo se hari n'umwe muri twe wari ukeneye.
The whole family is.	Umuryango wose ni.
It's the same.	Buri kimwe.
This is a beautiful house.	Iyi ni inzu nziza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo byose.
He knows what he can do.	Azi icyo ashobora gukora.
All he could see now was him alone.	Icyo yashoboraga kubona ubu ni we wenyine.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
We have to do it every morning !.	Tugomba kubikora buri gitondo!.
I think more than anyone else at home.	Ntekereza ko kurenza abantu bose murugo.
You can't even get married.	Ntushobora na nyuma yo gushaka.
They have many.	Bafite benshi.
I know it happened.	Nzi ko byagenze.
You can go for help or.	Ushobora kujya gushaka ubufasha cyangwa.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
You have to know everything.	Ugomba kumenya byose.
I was very young at the time.	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane.
We were not close.	Ntabwo twari hafi.
He knew he had to do something.	Yari azi ko agomba kugira icyo akora.
He looked down and said nothing.	Yarebye hasi ntacyo avuga.
I was three years old.	Nari mfite imyaka itatu.
You are doing well.	Ukora neza.
We have to do things right.	Tugomba gukora ibintu neza.
Work to do.	Akazi ko gukora.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
I'm not sure if someone meant something bad.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko umuntu yashakaga kuvuga ikintu kibi.
I know we are friends.	Nzi ko turi inshuti.
He wanted it right.	Yashakaga neza.
I know the baby is going to be a baby.	Nzi ko umwana agiye kuba umwana.
It's close.	Ari hafi.
Go back.	Gusubira inyuma.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
All of this is not always possible.	Ibi byose ntabwo buri gihe bishoboka.
And so was he.	Kandi na we ni ko yari.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
He knows it's possible.	Azi ko bishoboka.
We had that time.	Twari dufite icyo gihe.
I used to be an expert.	Nigeze kuba umuhanga.
I know he never thought of living together before.	Nzi ko atigeze atekereza cyane kubana mbere.
He was a young child.	Yari umwana muto.
And that's good enough.	Kandi nibyiza bihagije.
But everything will be fine.	Ariko ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
He hadn't thought about it for a long time.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe kinini atekereza kuri iki kibazo.
I found it easy to walk.	Nabonye byoroshye kugenda.
He has to go and he has to go now.	Agomba kugenda kandi agomba kugenda nonaha.
It is your family.	Ni umuryango wawe.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
He is on top.	Ari hejuru.
Tell her son.	Bwira umuhungu we.
And it is absolutely possible.	Kandi birashoboka rwose.
You can stop reading.	Urashobora guhagarika gusoma.
You can buy anything.	Urashobora kugura ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
He was gone.	Yari amaze kugenda.
It was too high for me.	Byari hejuru cyane kuri njye.
I think we have problems.	Ntekereza ko dufite ibibazo.
And that's a big deal.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu kinini.
I don't need much work.	Ntabwo nkeneye akazi cyane.
And it was not good.	Kandi ntabwo byari byiza.
But now he's gone too.	Ariko ubu na we yagiye.
They were scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
I'm sure you can do it.	Nzi neza ko ushobora kubikora.
We have to buy more food.	Tugomba kugura ibiryo byinshi.
Eventually he would find something good.	Amaherezo yari kubona ikintu yari mwiza.
He went.	Yagiye.
You were so beautiful.	Wari mwiza rwose.
if any.	niba hari.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
But it was difficult.	Ariko byari bigoye.
But then he looked in the room.	Ariko nyuma yarebye mu cyumba.
That's not an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
We were really high.	Twari hejuru rwose.
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
He is ready to do it.	Yiteguye kubikora.
He went in the morning.	Yagiye mu gitondo.
But he.	Ariko we.
I have my car.	Mfite imodoka yanjye.
I am too.	Nanjye ndi.
You are my friend.	Uri inshuti yanjye.
I have done well so far.	Nakoze neza kugeza ubu.
He is not someone you know.	Ntabwo ari umuntu uzi.
You are not listening.	Ntabwo uri kumva.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
One has to do better when speaking.	Umuntu agomba gukora neza mugihe avuga.
I really want to buy everything.	Ndashaka rwose kugura byose.
These are the good things of faith.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza byo kwizera.
Not really one.	Mubyukuri ntabwo ari umwe.
He was a young man who wanted to work, he wanted to study.	Yari umusore ushaka gukora, ashaka kwiga.
One, it was his father's house.	Umwe, yari inzu ya se.
And that was it.	Kandi ibyo byari byo.
He thought about his choice.	Yatekereje ku byo yahisemo.
I'm glad you're here later.	Nishimiye ko uri hano nyuma.
Sometimes it is not.	Rimwe na rimwe sibyo.
He wouldn't tell me.	Ntabwo yari kumbwira.
Not now.	Ntabwo ubu.
Very good.	Cyane cyane cyiza.
And he has to be.	Kandi agomba kuba.
They have children.	Bafite abana.
In all things.	Muri byose.
The car had gone.	Imodoka yari yagiye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
I saw it here.	Nabonye hano.
It was good to be out of everything.	Byari byiza kuva muri byose.
I know this world.	Nzi iyi si.
You have children.	Ufite abana.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
He is the only one.	Niwe wenyine.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
She was a very bad woman.	Yari umugore mubi cyane.
Maybe he should.	Birashoboka ko agomba.
I didn't know you were here.	Sinari nzi ko uri hano.
We have enough of that.	Dufite ibyo bihagije.
Nothing, nothing outside.	Nta kintu na kimwe, nta hanze.
I see it as a gift.	Mbona ko ari impano.
There is something to do.	Hariho ibyo gukora.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Things.	Ibintu.
Not at any time.	Ntabwo ari igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
He said he had to leave.	Yavuze ko agomba kugenda.
Everyone wants to play.	Umuntu wese arashaka gukina.
He didn't want to be.	Ntiyashakaga kuba.
Do you have to go?	Ugomba kugenda?
If he had.	Niba yari afite.
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
Age.	Imyaka.
It looks good.	Asa neza.
This is not the only problem.	Ntabwo ari iki kibazo gusa.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
And not really.	Kandi sibyo rwose.
She felt good.	Yumvise ari mwiza.
I am nothing.	Ntacyo ndi cyo.
You think you can do anything!	Utekereza ko ushobora gukora ikintu cyose!.
Everything you need	Ibyo ukeneye byose.
It is a loving family.	Ni umuryango ukunda.
Can we all get along well?	Twese dushobora kubana neza?
There is a reason.	Hariho impamvu.
In that he is right.	Muri ibyo afite ukuri.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi nibyo rwose.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
You have to do the same.	Nawe ugomba kubikora.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
You have to have something you like.	Ugomba kugira ibyo ukunda.
I am a dog.	Ndi imbwa.
I can't believe he's gone.	Sinshobora kwizera ko yagiye.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
He got it all.	Yabonye byose.
We can't take years to study.	Ntidushobora gufata imyaka yo kwiga.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
She doesn't like children.	Ntabwo akunda abana.
But he had to be good.	Ariko yagombaga kuba mwiza.
I want to believe that.	Ndashaka kwizera ko aribyo.
He wanted to know everything.	Yashakaga kumenya byose.
He thought so.	Yatekereje ko aribyo.
He seemed to be talking.	Yasaga naho yashakaga kuvuga.
You just did it.	Wabikoze gusa.
Someone you love.	Umuntu ukunda.
You can only say what you saw.	Urashobora kuvuga gusa ibyo wabonye.
I mean, that's not true.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko atari byo.
It's a good idea to have friends.	Ni ikintu cyiza kugira inshuti.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
Everyone should read this.	Umuntu wese agomba gusoma ibi.
It's his car.	Ni imodoka ye.
Bottom line is what we have.	Hasi nibyo dufite.
I have a daughter.	Mfite umukobwa.
Here.	Hano.
I'm not doing well.	Ntabwo nkora neza.
Everyone knows who you mean.	Abantu bose bazi uwo ushaka kuvuga.
It was like his father.	Byari nka se.
He was not a bad person.	Ntiyari umuntu mubi.
It's not money at the moment.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga muri iki gihe.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
You are a child.	Uri umwana.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Abantu bose bari bazi ko azaba ahari.
I just didn't know what to do.	Gusa sinari nzi icyo gukora.
No one had.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
He had to be good.	Yagombaga kuba mwiza.
But if.	Ariko niba.
Making money.	Kubona amafaranga.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
No one knows.	Nta muntu n'umwe bazi.
I'm here tomorrow.	Ndi hano ejo.
I thought you might try.	Natekereje ko ushobora kugerageza.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
Maybe he should go.	Ahari agomba kugenda.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
And she is always beautiful.	Kandi ahora ari mwiza.
I had heard.	Nari numvise.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I knew you were doing the same thing.	Nari nzi ko ukora kimwe.
That's it.	Turi uko.
Bombi.	Bombi.
Is it possible?	Birashoboka?
If they knew he had problems.	Niba bari bazi ko afite ibibazo.
He is trying hard.	Arimo kugerageza cyane.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I need to be here.	Nkeneye kuba hano.
You have to get a job.	Ugomba kubona akazi.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
Me and me and me and me.	Njye na njye nanjye nanjye nanjye.
You really were.	Wari rwose.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
But now, nothing.	Ariko ubu, nta kintu.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
If that's what you want.	Niba aribyo ushaka.
Leave this alone.	Kureka ibi wenyine.
If they were here.	Niba bari hano.
You can tell me.	Urashobora kumbwira.
He is not an expert.	Ntabwo ari umuhanga.
Or food.	Cyangwa ibiryo.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It's true now.	Ni ukuri ubu.
Not at all possible.	Ntabwo bishoboka rwose.
I don’t know how this is possible.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo ibi bishoboka.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikibazo kinini.
You are not sure what to do with that fact.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo gukora kuri uko kuri.
He was young and beautiful.	Yari muto kandi mwiza.
You are not sure if this is possible.	Ntabwo uzi neza niba bishoboka.
I had no one.	Nta muntu n'umwe nari mfite.
I'm good at this.	Ndi mwiza kuri ibi.
Niki, type.	Niki, turi.
He was not as scared as usual.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba nk'uko byari bisanzwe.
It was not very far.	Ntiyari kure cyane.
Easy, good, good.	Byoroshye, byiza, byiza.
Much of it actually.	Byinshi mubyukuri.
And that is possible.	Kandi ngo birashoboka.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
I don't want to see that again.	Sinshaka kongera kubona icyo kintu.
He thought it was a good thing.	Yatekereje ko ari ikintu cyiza.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
This is it.	Iyi ni.
That's not what he expected.	Ntabwo ari uko yari yiteze.
Or her son.	Cyangwa umuhungu we.
I'm sure, like me.	Nzi neza ko, nkanjye.
I've never heard of such a thing before.	Sinigeze numva ikintu kibi mbere.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi neza ko yabikoze.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije bihagije.
Maybe there is a chance.	Ahari hariho amahirwe.
The young man was worried and scared.	Umusore yari afite impungenge kandi afite ubwoba.
I have time.	Mfite umwanya.
Especially during meals.	Cyane cyane mugihe cyo kurya.
And you can't do anything.	Kandi ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
But for me, the movie is great.	Ariko kuri njye, firime ni nziza cyane.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
You have to.	Ugomba.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko aribyo.
I know nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe nzi.
This is him.	Uyu ni we.
He always says.	Ahora avuga.
Well done kids.	Neza abana.
But it’s not just work.	Ariko si akazi gusa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane ko umwanya muto hano, yatekereje.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Very bad thing.	Ikintu kibi cyane.
This is not very good, but it is good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza cyane, ariko nibyiza.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
One found a house.	Umwe yabonye inzu.
It will not be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza.
He was ready for something else.	Yari yiteguye ikindi kintu.
Time to look.	Umwanya wo kureba.
He didn’t have to go far.	Ntabwo yagombaga kujya kure.
He came almost another time.	Yaje hafi ikindi gihe.
I never got the money.	Sinigeze mbona amafaranga.
He had a house.	Yari afite inzu.
He didn't want to be there.	Ntiyashakaga kuba ahari.
That's what we need.	Nibyo dukeneye.
Today, not tomorrow.	Uyu munsi, si ejo.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
I think it's good.	Ndakeka ko ari byiza.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
I was happy.	Nari nishimiye.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko bazi ikintu atazi.
And that is possible.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka.
I think that's exactly what happened.	Ntekereza ko aribyo rwose.
Obviously this is a long thing.	Biragaragara ko iki ari ikintu kirekire.
This was just a movie.	Iyi yari firime gusa.
They are good friends.	Ni inshuti nziza.
From there.	Kuva aho.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
I’ve seen a lot, in fact.	Nabonye byinshi, mubyukuri.
Sometimes it is absolutely possible.	Rimwe na rimwe birashoboka rwose.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
The money is here.	Amafaranga ari hano.
He told me once.	Yambwiye rimwe.
That's not what I do.	Ntabwo ari ibyo nkora.
She is so beautiful to her children.	Ni mwiza cyane kubana be.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
You can take whomever you want.	Urashobora gufata uwo ushaka.
Everything was fine for him.	Byose byari byiza kuri we.
I can't think of that.	Sinshobora gutekereza icyo kintu.
And there is a problem for us.	Kandi hariho ikibazo kuri twe.
But he would not do it.	Ariko ntiyari kubikora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, kuri ubu nibyo.
She is not the woman of her choice.	Ntabwo ari umugore yahisemo.
We are far from all.	Turi kure ya bose.
I don't know who that is.	Sinzi uwo bishoboka.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
Everyone was there.	Abantu bose bari.
She needs a job.	Akeneye akazi.
She likes to walk her dog.	Akunda kugenda imbwa ye.
He did not know how to do it.	Ntabwo yari azi uko yabikoze.
He knew it was there.	Yari azi ko ahari.
He knew better than to look back.	Yari azi neza kuruta kureba inyuma.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I want to win today.	Ndashaka gutsinda uyu munsi.
But only here.	Ariko hano gusa.
This is true.	Iki ni ukuri.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
I had the opportunity to get a job.	Nagize amahirwe yo kubona akazi.
This is probably a problem for many of us.	Ibi birashoboka ko ari ikibazo kuri benshi muri twe.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
I believe it is a mistake.	Nizera ko ari amakosa.
I was just a boy.	Nari umuhungu gusa.
He can wait.	Ashobora gutegereza.
I knew the plan.	Nari nzi gahunda.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
Or maybe he was looking for a friend.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yashakaga inshuti.
She was looking for a baby.	Yashakaga umwana.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nibyo.
That was easier said than done.	Ibyo byari byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
With it, you can do whatever you want.	Hamwe na we, urashobora gukora uko ushaka.
Probably not all.	Birashoboka ko atari byose.
His last chance was gone.	Amahirwe ye ya nyuma yagiye.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
Like a phone.	Kimwe na terefone.
There is nothing to do at that time.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gukora icyo gihe.
We must do the same.	Natwe tugomba kubikora.
We are not.	Ntabwo turi.
She knew in that look that he had arrived in her room.	Yari azi ko, ubu, hano mu cyumba cye.
He never spoke.	Ntiyigeze avuga.
I didn't need to play again.	Sinari nkeneye kongera gukina.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
He said things would be better.	Yavuze ko ibintu byari kuba byiza.
That's what we have to do.	Nibyo tugomba gukora.
Not at all, either.	Na gato, kandi.
But the idea is big.	Ariko igitekerezo ni kinini.
And that's not what I mean.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo nshaka kuvuga.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
I'm scared of everything.	Mfite ubwoba muri byose.
He did not want them to do so.	Ntiyashakaga ko abikora.
He wanted to go home.	Yashakaga gutaha.
But she was just one woman.	Ariko yari umugore umwe gusa.
He admitted to making a mistake.	Yemeye ko yakoze amakosa.
I don't know when.	Sinzi igihe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He had children behind.	Yari afite abana inyuma.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
Or not.	Cyangwa sibyo.
I like to watch.	Nkunda kureba.
He must have a reason.	Agomba kuba afite impamvu.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I had one of those.	Nari mfite kimwe muri ibyo.
That's right, here.	Nibyo, hano.
You can do it at home, people.	Urashobora kubikora murugo, abantu.
No giving up.	Nta kureka.
Maybe good, good.	Ahari mwiza, mwiza.
Well, a lot of things.	Nibyiza, ibintu byinshi.
I didn't know what happened.	Sinari nzi uko byagenze.
The boy doesn't know what to say.	Umuhungu ntazi icyo avuga.
He used to play all the time.	Yakundaga gukina igihe cyose.
Or outside.	Cyangwa hanze.
This is what everyone loves.	Ibi nibyo buri wese akunda.
It was a way.	Byari uburyo.
He can't stay.	Ntashobora kuguma.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje kuri ibyo.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
But he never worried.	Ariko ntiyigeze agira impungenge.
I’m not a lot of people.	Ntabwo ndi abantu benshi.
He couldn't have come better.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kuza neza.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
But he was not in it or in it.	Ariko ntabwo yari muri yo cyangwa muri yo.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I would not wait.	Ntabwo nari gutegereza.
Tell me the truth.	Mbwira ukuri.
Everything.	Buri kintu cyose.
No one knew where he was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho ari.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
They have very little time.	Bafite umwanya muto cyane.
He was now in front of her.	Ubu yari imbere ye.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose aribyo.
I'm not sure about this.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibi.
First wife.	Umugore wa mbere.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
There is nothing we can do about it right now.	Nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora kuri ubu.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I have to stay.	Ngomba kuguma.
Yari.	Yari.
He is a good child.	Ni umwana mwiza.
That day is not far away.	Uwo munsi ntabwo uri kure.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
He did not want her to leave.	Ntiyashakaga ko agenda.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, biragaragara ibyo tugomba gukora ubu.
Obviously you don’t want to live.	Biragaragara ko udashaka kubaho.
It’s another thing to give up.	Ni ikindi kintu cyo kureka.
All he knew was that he had to talk to her.	Icyo yari azi gusa ni uko agomba kuvugana na we.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, rwose.
This is a good time for us.	Iki ni igihe cyiza kuri twe.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari kuri bose.
One by one.	Umwe kuri umwe.
I know my phone is alone.	Nzi ko terefone yanjye ari wenyine.
He came to tell me.	Yaje kumbwira.
Or anything you can think of.	Cyangwa ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose ushobora gutekereza.
He didn't have time to look.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo kureba.
You must have done it before.	Ugomba kuba wabikoze mbere.
He used to do things.	Yakundaga gukora ibintu.
He is young, he knows how to speak well, and he speaks well.	Ari muto, azi kuvuga neza, no kuvuga neza.
Trying to find out.	Kugerageza kumenya.
Food was all he needed before.	Ibiryo nibyo yari akeneye mbere.
He has a dog.	Afite imbwa.
That's not what he does.	Ntabwo aribyo akora.
He knew he had to go.	Yari azi ko agomba kugenda.
This, of course, is very difficult.	Ibi biragaragara, ariko, kuba bigoye cyane.
Apparently he didn't.	Biragaragara ko atabikoze.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She was not a very beautiful woman.	Ntabwo yari umugore mwiza cyane.
Question.	Ikibazo.
Today the boy is not alone.	Uyu munsi ntabwo umuhungu ari wenyine.
I had.	Nari mfite.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
But he wants food.	Ariko arashaka ibyo kurya.
It worked really well.	Byagenze neza rwose.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
I mean, he tried.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yagerageje.
If so, everyone would do it.	Niba aribyo, abantu bose bari kubikora.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
The big one.	Kinini kinini.
That was yesterday.	Ibyo byari ejo.
More than you are	Kurenza uko uri.
I guess.	Ndakeka.
We need more.	Dukeneye byinshi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
He is a good man, very good.	Ni umuntu mwiza, neza rwose.
He’s not a guy to watch.	Ntabwo ari umusore wo kureba.
We need to ask for advice.	Tugomba gusaba inama.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
She is very beautiful.	Ari mwiza cyane.
She was happy to see her daughter.	Yishimiye kubona umukobwa we.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It’s not a matter of waiting.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo cyo gutegereza.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I think this is just fine.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza gusa.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
He was close.	Yari hafi.
You have to work hard.	Ugomba gukora cyane.
I don't know why he did it.	Sinzi impamvu yabikoze.
He is ready to go.	Yiteguye kugenda.
Definitely buy more.	Rwose kugura byinshi.
He got it wrong.	Yabonye nabi.
It is not a prison.	Ntabwo ari gereza.
And he probably has the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi.
I would stay with him.	Nari kuguma hamwe na we.
I don't understand.	Ntabwo ndimo ndumva.
Going home, that's right.	Kujya murugo, nibyo.
This here, and here and here.	Ibi hano, na hano na hano.
There is a party here.	Hano hari ibirori.
Everyone knows everything.	Abantu bose bazi byose.
He didn’t try to tell me it would be good.	Ntabwo yagerageje kumbwira ko byaba byiza.
He wants to live again.	Ashaka kongera kubaho.
It really had to be.	Yagombaga rwose kuba.
Getting a movie.	Kubona firime.
But he was not an expert.	Ariko ntabwo yari umuhanga.
The school was outside.	Ishuri ryari hanze.
I am the only one.	Uwo ni njye wenyine.
He has no plans.	Nta gahunda afite.
It was time.	Byari igihe.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Yari azi ibintu byose yari akeneye kumenya.
In his father's house.	Mu nzu ya se.
He has a young son.	Afite umuhungu muto.
It is not his fault at all.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye rwose.
Everyone wants to do better.	Umuntu wese arashaka gukora neza.
I think there are good things.	Ntekereza ko hari ibintu byiza.
What would he look like? 	Ni iki yari kureba?
Things are good today.	Ibintu ni byiza muri iki gihe.
This time he had the best things he heard.	Iki gihe yari afite ibintu byiza yumvise.
Then he came to where I am.	Icyo gihe yaje aho ndi.
He did it all.	Yakoze byose.
I love what you do.	Nkunda ibyo ukora.
He is a young man.	Ni umusore.
I can't take anything else!	Sinshobora gufata ikindi kintu!
I can't wait.	Sinshobora gutegereza.
He can play.	Arashobora gukina.
He was lucky.	Yari afite amahirwe.
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza.
His father too.	Se na we.
It will not be a problem for me at all.	Ntabwo bizaba ikibazo na gato kuri njye.
But for me it is not.	Ariko kuri njye ntabwo aribyo.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ntacyo ushobora gukora.
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I know nothing.	Ntacyo nzi.
What do you think	Uratekereza iki?
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
This is good.	Ibi nibyiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I need to get out of here.	Nkeneye kuva hano.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
We are working hard.	Turi gukora cyane.
It seems very difficult, doesn't it?	Birasa naho bigoye cyane, sibyo?
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
There are so many.	Hariho benshi cyane.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
He gave the dog food.	Yahaye imbwa ibiryo.
I had a whole family.	Nagize umuryango wose.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
It’s something he can never do.	Ni ikintu adashobora na rimwe gukora.
He knows nothing about anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe azi ku kintu na kimwe.
A young man who works.	Umusore ukora akazi.
But working fast is not easy.	Ariko gukora vuba ntabwo byoroshye.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
More than that.	Kurenza kuri.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi impamvu neza.
I love it so much.	Nkunda cyane.
Who he is	Ni uwo ari we.
I had one house.	Nari mfite inzu rimwe.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
For me, that was good.	Kuri njye, ibyo byari byiza.
Too long	Igihe kirekire cyane.
Let it be the little thing of.	Reka kuba ikintu gito cya.
I feel nothing for him.	Ntacyo numva kuri we.
You had a plan.	Wari ufite gahunda.
Playing backwards.	Gukina inyuma.
Not that day.	Ntabwo ari uwo munsi.
But it looks like he will eventually do it.	Ariko birasa nkaho amaherezo azabikora.
Close, and close.	Hafi, kandi hafi.
That's what he could do.	Ni byo yashoboraga gukora.
You can come here.	Urashobora kuza hano.
He tried to think about what he was saying.	Yagerageje gutekereza kubyo avuga.
I'm not very good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza cyane.
Someone was inside me.	Hari umuntu wari muri njye.
It's just a school.	Ni ishuri gusa.
It’s not a party.	Ntabwo ari ibirori.
A woman should not say her age.	Umugore ntabwo agomba kuvuga imyaka ye.
You have to go back and you have to go back soon.	Ugomba gusubira inyuma kandi ugomba gusubira vuba.
You have to be able to try anything you want.	Ugomba kuba ushobora kugerageza ikintu cyose ushaka.
It is an opportunity for him.	Ni amahirwe kuri we.
That was something he knew.	Ibyo byari ibintu yari azi.
There is a plan.	Hariho gahunda.
He has to take it.	Agomba gufata.
Out here	Hanze aha.
Obviously not good.	Biragaragara ko atari byiza.
There is work.	Hariho akazi.
I think it's because he knows something.	Ntekereza ko ari uko hari icyo azi.
It would not have been easy.	Ntabwo byari kuba byoroshye.
And a bad thing to do.	Kandi ikintu kibi cyo gukora.
But he said nothing to anyone.	Ariko ntacyo yabwiye umuntu.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
He wants to talk.	Arashaka kuvuga.
I want to take my wife.	Ndashaka gutwara umugore wanjye.
I was just here.	Nari hano gusa.
He was looking for a house.	Yashakaga inzu.
Little did he know that he would do it.	Ntiyari azi ko azabikora.
You have to stop doing that.	Ugomba guhagarika gukora ibyo.
He didn’t have to think much.	Ntabwo yagombaga gutekereza cyane.
I need to know how he did it.	Nkeneye kumenya uko yabikoze.
He didn't want to hear.	Ntiyashakaga kumva.
I didn't know what to do!	Sinari nzi icyo gukora!
But that was enough.	Ariko ibyo byari bihagije.
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
This one is for us.	Uyu kuri twe.
That's exactly what I feel.	Nibyo rwose numva ari njye.
You can do anything.	Urashobora gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
He went.	Yagiye.
'	'
It doesn't look right to me.	Ntabwo asa naho ari ukuri kuri njye.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
He was not a friend.	Ntiyari inshuti.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
It was not good at all.	Ntiyari mwiza na gato.
You knew who he was.	Wari uziko ari we.
This was very close.	Ibi byari hafi cyane.
There was fear then.	Icyo gihe hari ubwoba.
Her hair was down.	Umusatsi we wari hasi.
You can have a house.	Urashobora kugira inzu.
He thought he would do it.	Yatekereje ko azabikora.
He found school difficult and often had problems.	Yabonye ishuri bigoye kandi yakundaga kugira ibibazo.
Maybe it was him.	Ahari uwo yari we.
I'm sure that is true.	Nzi neza ko mubyukuri.
That was a lot.	Ibyo byari byinshi.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
Something.	Ikintu.
I was going to school.	Nari ngiye ku ishuri.
It went wrong.	Byagenze nabi.
Things were good for everyone when he was here.	Ibintu byari byiza kuri buri wese igihe yari hano.
He can do it.	Arashobora kubikora.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He really is.	Ni we rwose.
That's great, isn't it?	Nibyiza cyane, sibyo?
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
But not for long.	Ariko si igihe gito.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
He went.	Yagiye.
It will be great.	Bizaba byiza cyane.
No one wants to stay here.	Nta n'umwe ushaka kuguma hano.
It was a matter of waiting.	Byari ikibazo cyo gutegereza.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I don't see this.	Ntabwo mbona ibi.
That was close to me.	Ibyo byari hafi yanjye.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
I love this house.	Nkunda iyi nzu.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
But this is not a problem.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Everything went well before.	Byose byagenze neza mbere.
He tried to try.	Yagerageje kugerageza.
And it was really good.	Kandi byari byiza rwose.
You didn't have one in you.	Ntabwo wari ufite muri wowe.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
That is something else.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu.
But it was difficult.	Ariko byari bigoye.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Dropping out of school.	Kureka ishuri.
This was normal.	Ibi byari ibintu bisanzwe.
And I don’t have to.	Kandi ntagomba.
Not that he was going.	Ntabwo ari uko yari agiye.
We have to go!	Tugomba kugenda!
He had to stop thinking.	Yagombaga kureka gutekereza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari yaba yagiye vuba cyane.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
They had a lot of time.	Bari bafite igihe kinini.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
Probably none of that.	Birashoboka ko nta na kimwe muri byo.
They are not afraid.	Ntabwo bafite ubwoba.
I'm glad to be.	Nishimiye kuba ya.
For me, that's right.	Kuri njye, nibyo.
It was easy, really.	Byari byoroshye, mubyukuri.
I want to drive my car.	Ndashaka gutwara imodoka yanjye.
Here, look at his house.	Hano, kureba inzu ye.
There is a guy here who can do anything.	Hano hari umusore ushobora gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
I was actually.	Nari mubyukuri.
I am one.	Ndi umwe.
It will not be the same.	Ntabwo bizaba kimwe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He wanted to do it.	Yashakaga kubikora.
Normal good things.	Ibintu byiza bisanzwe.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
He is my dog.	Ni imbwa yanjye.
You have a job.	Ufite akazi.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
Or almost everyone.	Cyangwa hafi ya bose.
It is possible and possible.	Birashoboka kandi birashoboka.
My wife is one.	Umugore wanjye ni umwe.
He is talking.	Arimo kuvuga.
Is that possible?	Ibyo birashoboka?
It was hard to find the right time.	Byari bigoye kubona umwanya mwiza.
There is no stopping work.	Nta guhagarika akazi.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
I'm sure he has.	Nzi neza ko afite.
Only you are far from him.	Wowe gusa uri kure ye.
You can't be both.	Ntushobora kuba bombi.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
This is normal.	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe.
She needs to drink.	Akeneye kunywa.
There is a lot to look forward to.	Hariho byinshi byo gutegereza.
He did not do that.	Ibyo atabikoze.
I was a smart guy.	Nari umusore uzi ubwenge.
John in a short time.	Yohana mu gihe gito.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
Just work.	Akazi gusa.
And here it is.	Kandi hano ari hano.
Anything you can think of.	Ikintu cyose ushobora gutekereza.
I thought he might be.	Natekerezaga ko ashobora kuba.
For everyone.	Kuri buri wese.
You need to have a good reading book.	Ugomba kubona igitabo cyiza cyo gusoma.
Almost all of us.	Hafi ya twese.
It's not hair.	Ntabwo ari umusatsi.
All of this is great.	Ibi byose nibyiza cyane.
You should not drink and drive.	Ntugomba kunywa no gutwara.
Now we have to go back to school.	Ubu tugomba gusubira ku ishuri.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko.
You know what.	Ibyo uzi neza.
I got it right.	Nabonye neza.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
I want to see both of them again.	Ndashaka kongera kubona bombi.
I'm going to be behind you.	Ngiye kuba inyuma yawe.
There are a lot of people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I mean, he knows exactly what he's doing.	Ndashaka kuvuga, azi neza ibyo akora.
But he knew full well that he was right.	Ariko yari azi neza ko afite ukuri.
Too much.	Kuba cyane.
They have a lot.	Bafite byinshi.
But not here.	Ariko sibyo hano.
And maybe we are.	Kandi birashoboka ko turi.
It's a good day for him.	Ni umunsi mwiza kuri we.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari aha.
He is the best of us all.	Niwe mwiza muri twese.
I don't think it's easy.	Ntabwo mbona ko byoroshye.
He should have come sooner.	Yari akwiye kuza vuba.
That is very high.	Ibyo ni hejuru cyane.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And there is more to it.	Kandi hariho byinshi kuri byo.
He needed to be alone.	Yari akeneye kuba wenyine.
It will be very soon.	Bizaba vuba cyane.
They wouldn't tell me.	Ntabwo bari kumbwira.
I have to stay.	Ngomba kuguma.
I hope you are beautiful.	Nizera ko uri mwiza.
He was absolutely scared.	Yari afite ubwoba rwose.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I knew it was true.	Nari nzi ko ari ukuri.
I would not have had the time.	Ntabwo nari kuba mfite umwanya.
I don't like this.	Ntabwo nkunda ibi.
That is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibintu.
Not to mention.	Nta kuvuga.
It is advice.	Ni inama.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba hano.
This was certainly true.	Ibi rwose byari ukuri.
There is so much!	Hariho byinshi cyane!
I can't see.	Ntashobora kubona.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
But he says nothing.	Ariko ntacyo avuga.
At the time, he was ready to leave.	Muri icyo gihe yari yiteguye kugenda.
Maybe a good idea.	Ahari igitekerezo cyiza.
But we are just friends.	Ariko turi inshuti gusa.
Everything was fine.	Ibintu byose byari byiza.
He has no problem.	Nta kibazo afite.
This is early in the morning.	Ibi mu gitondo cya kare.
Or for him alone.	Cyangwa kuri we wenyine.
The child asked for more.	Umwana yasabye byinshi.
He had come to where he was.	Yari yaje aho ari.
The young man said nothing.	Umusore ntacyo yavuze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Or living together.	Cyangwa kubana.
I really wanted to do it.	Nashakaga kubikora mubyukuri.
And you can.	Kandi urashobora.
If you have any ideas.	Niba ufite igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose.
It was only once.	Ryari rimwe gusa.
One bad place.	Umwanya umwe mubi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I am his friend.	Ndi inshuti ye.
She wants to live in a nice house.	Ashaka kuba mu nzu nziza.
My favorite boy	Umuhungu nkunda.
You don’t have to go back.	Ntugomba gusubira inyuma.
I know how he works.	Nzi uko akora.
And ,, he needed to try something, anything.	Kandi ,, yari akeneye kugerageza ikintu, ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
But he was worried that this was too much.	Ariko yari afite impungenge ko ibyo ari byinshi.
But you can't do that.	Ariko ntushobora kubikora.
Her first son.	Umuhungu we wa mbere.
Until one day.	Kugeza umunsi umwe.
What is he looking for?	Arimo gushaka iki?
He knows nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe azi.
I know how to win.	Nzi gutsinda.
I have good friends.	Mfite inshuti nziza.
How he was sometimes.	Uburyo yari rimwe na rimwe.
He was not sure what to say.	Ntiyari azi neza icyo avuga.
Doing something does nothing.	Gukora ikintu ntacyo ukora.
There is one small thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gito.
Here he is seeing for the first time.	Hano arimo kubona bwa mbere.
It was close.	Byari hafi.
There is always that possibility.	Buri gihe hariho ibyo bishoboka.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Or whatever.	Cyangwa ibyo aribyo byose.
I really need advice.	Nkeneye rwose inama.
I'm sorry	Mbabajwe.
Food for one.	Ibiryo kuri kimwe.
He has time, and he has a lot.	Afite umwanya, kandi ni byinshi.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.

He was right about that.	Yari afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
He asked for his time.	Yasabye umwanya we.
I am for him.	Ni njye kuri we.
I thought it was great !.	Natekereje ko byari byiza!.
It will be here.	Bizaba hano.
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.
He was right about that.	Yari afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
I like movies.	Nkunda firime.
All of us.	Twese.
Not much of it.	Ntabwo ari byinshi muri byo.
Good stuff !!.	Ibintu byiza !!.
Stop thinking about this.	Reka gutekereza kuri ibi.
I am very happy to buy.	Nishimiye cyane kugura.
But you are so beautiful.	Ariko uri mwiza cyane.
Everything was going well.	Ibintu byose byari kugenda neza.
And this would be true.	Kandi ibi byaba ari ukuri.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
She is happy to be able to help.	Yishimiye ko ashobora gufasha.
He had come.	Yari yaje.
He never lived on time.	Ntiyigeze aba ku gihe.
I am very happy with what happened.	Nishimiye cyane uko byagenze.
He had a job.	Yari afite akazi.
He made the right choice.	Yahisemo neza.
I should have done.	Nari nkwiye gukora.
No.	Na.
He could only see.	Yashoboraga kureba gusa.
He said it was a lot.	Yavuze ko byari byinshi.
Another time.	Ikindi gihe.
But it looks good on me.	Ariko birasa neza kuri njye.
I thought it was a really good thing.	Natekereje ko ari ikintu cyiza rwose.
And that's right.	Kandi ibyo nibyo.

You know what would happen.	Uzi uko byari kugenda.
You don't know for sure.	Ntabwo uzi neza.
We had a lot.	Twari dufite byinshi.
But for him, it was nothing.	Ariko kuri we, nta cyo byari.
He had come.	Yari yaje.
The truth is you can.	Ukuri urashobora.
No one said.	Nta muntu wavuze.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
For many, that's right.	Kuri benshi, nibyo.
He said something bad.	Yavuze neza ikintu kibi.
I really don't know much about him.	Ntabwo rwose nzi byinshi kuri we.
No need to look back.	Nta mpamvu yo kureba inyuma.
I was just his wife.	Nari umugore we gusa.
He thought he was crazy.	Yatekereje ko adafite ubwenge.
That's really good for me.	Nibyiza rwose kuri njye.
This is the place.	Ibi ni.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
That's right.	Ibyo ni byo.
You had done it.	Wari wabikoze.
He could have done better.	Yashoboraga gukora neza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He has a top.	Afite hejuru.
You have a lot of time.	Ufite igihe kinini.
I like the way he went out.	Nkunda uburyo yagiye hanze.
He would be old.	Yaba afite imyaka.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
He said it was too high.	Yavuze ko byari hejuru cyane.
He is a good dog.	Ni imbwa nziza.
There is a feeling that we are one family.	Hariho kumva ko turi umuryango umwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Eventually, however, he had to go to work.	Ariko, amaherezo, yagombaga kujya ku kazi.
Apparently not him.	Biragaragara ko atari we.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
Three years is a short time.	Imyaka itatu ni igihe gito.
I can't eat.	Ntashobora kurya.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko byari byiza.
But it is too small.	Ariko ni gito cyane.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
Not now, or.	Ntabwo ari ubu, cyangwa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
My son works hard.	Umwana wanjye akora cyane.
Not every idea is good.	Ntabwo igitekerezo cyose ari cyiza.
I am a young man.	Ndi umusore.
Everything was normal.	Byose byari bisanzwe.
I did nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nakoze.
In or out.	Muri cyangwa hanze.
There is only one girl who wants to talk.	Hariho umukobwa umwe gusa ashaka kuvugana.
I just doubt it.	Ndashidikanya gusa.
I was here before.	Nari hano mbere.
We needed money.	Twari dukeneye amafaranga.
I can't take anything else.	Sinshobora gufata ikindi.
None of us.	Hari n'umwe muri twe.
They didn't have time to do it.	Ntabwo bari bafite umwanya wo kubikora.
Someone.	Umuntu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Maybe he could see something.	Birashoboka ko hari ikintu yashoboraga kubona.
It started at a young age.	Yatangiye akiri muto.
I saw someone.	Nabonye umuntu.
He needed help.	Yari akeneye ubufasha.
Someone mentioned my daughter.	Hari umuntu wavuze umukobwa wanjye.
He told me later.	Yambwiye nyuma.
I can’t just stop things.	Sinshobora guhagarika ibintu gusa.
He could have done better.	Yashoboraga kurenza.
He lives nearby.	Aba hafi.
I wasn’t even going to think about that possible.	Ntabwo nari ngiye no gutekereza kuri ibyo bishoboka.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
His family had one.	Umuryango we wari ufite umwe.
I just didn't know how to do it.	Gusa sinari nzi kubikora.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
He was not really ready to go.	Ntabwo rwose yari yiteguye kugenda.
He says a lot.	Avuga byinshi.
It’s something we can go above and beyond.	Ni ikintu dushobora kujya hejuru.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
You don’t have time to think.	Ntabwo ufite umwanya wo gutekereza.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
He would not work.	Ntabwo yari gukora.
I have that.	Mfite ibyo.
The space he wanted.	Umwanya yashakaga.
How close.	Niki hafi.
But there is a problem with that.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kuri ibyo.
He thought he could win.	Yatekereje ko ashobora gutsinda.
If not, you can try it now.	Niba atari byo, ushobora kugerageza ubu.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
And here is something everyone can understand.	Kandi hano hari ikintu buri wese ashobora kumva neza.
One cannot be anything one wants.	Umuntu ntashobora kuba ikintu cyose ashaka.
But more.	Ariko ikindi.
And I love it all.	Kandi nkunda kandi byose.
Things were just fine.	Ibintu byari gusa.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
You are a small person.	Uri umuntu muto.
You have a lot of problems, right?	Ufite ibibazo byinshi, sibyo?
He didn't want to tell anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kubwira umuntu.
But they were close.	Ariko bari hafi.
It was good that he was leaving.	Byari byiza ko agenda.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko ari ukuri kuva mbere.
And what one needs.	Kandi icyo umuntu akeneye.
It's not like me.	Ntabwo ari nkanjye.
I was just thinking.	Natekerezaga gusa.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ukeneye kuba wowe gusa.
But in reality, that's not all.	Ariko mubyukuri byose, ntabwo aribyo.
I wanted to say more.	Nashakaga kuvuga byinshi.
Only it was true.	Gusa byari ukuri.
With everyone, in fact.	Numuntu wese, mubyukuri.
Me too, especially.	Nanjye, cyane cyane.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
Maybe we.	Ahari twe.
Nothing would happen.	Ntacyo byari kuba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
There is a party here.	Hano hari ibirori.
And in fact, he had to make a film.	Kandi mubyukuri, yagombaga gukora firime.
I didn’t think much of it.	Ntabwo natekereje kuri byinshi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
But none of that.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
He was young but intelligent.	Yari muto ariko afite ubwenge.
He didn't know why he didn't want to.	Ntiyari azi impamvu atigeze ashaka.
You really have to go.	Ugomba kugenda rwose.
Everything is nothing.	Ibintu byose ntacyo.
I'm really close.	Ndi hafi rwose.
There is so much to have.	Hariho byinshi cyane byo kugira.
You want to work today.	Ushaka gukora uyu munsi.
He thought like his father.	Yatekereje nka se.
The woman too.	Umugore na we.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
Things to know.	Ibintu ugomba kumenya.
There are many things you can do.	Hariho ibintu byinshi ushobora gukora.
He spoke to me.	Yavuze kuri njye.
As it turned out in the end.	Nkuko byagenze amaherezo.
I should have won.	Nari nkwiye gutsinda.
He thought the plan was good.	Yatekereje ko gahunda yari nziza.
She needs her time to be a child.	Akeneye igihe cye cyo kuba umwana.
But that was a lot for him.	Ariko ibi byari byinshi kuri we.
These are things like, or.	Ibi ni ibintu nka, cyangwa.
He was a young man, if young, a young man.	Yari umusore, niba ari muto, umusore.
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
He didn't have to help.	Ntabwo yagombaga gufasha.
But neither is he.	Ariko na we ntabwo aribyo.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
For everything.	Kuri byose.
But he has to wait.	Ariko agomba gutegereza.
Outside, he was alone.	Hanze, yari wenyine.
You can tell me.	Urashobora kumbwira.
One has to.	Umuntu agomba.
That is not the case and you know why.	Ntabwo aribyo kandi uzi impamvu.
He was probably alone.	Birashoboka ko yari wenyine.
I want to do this as he does.	Ndashaka gukora ibi nkuko abikora.
I didn't know you had a car.	Sinari nzi ko ufite imodoka.
And there are plenty of opportunities to come.	Kandi hari amahirwe menshi yo kuza.
They know for sure that they have.	Bazi neza ko bafite.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
You don't have one.	Ntabwo ufite.
A boy can have a good idea.	Umuhungu arashobora kugira igitekerezo cyiza.
When you are young, you should.	Iyo uri muto, ugomba.
You need more.	Ukeneye byinshi.
You saw.	Wabonye.
I ask everything now.	Ndabaza buri kintu ubu.
Of course, he is not alone.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari wenyine.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Whatever it was on him.	Ibyo ari byo byose yari kuri yo.
I think he is the only one.	Ndakeka ko ari we wenyine.
Please, please.	Nyamuneka, nyamuneka.
But there is one problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kimwe.
This was not his beautiful home.	Iyi ntiyari inzu ye nziza.
I can't.	Sinshobora.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ni umukobwa mwiza.
When is the best time to do this?	Ni ryari igihe cyiza cyo gukora ibi?
I don't want to go back to school.	Sinshaka gusubira ku ishuri.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
Anything a good person can be, is.	Ikintu cyose umuntu mwiza ashobora kuba, ni.
You didn't need to.	Ntabwo wari ukeneye.
', it was'.	', yari'.
We have food.	Dufite ibyo kurya.
It would be the same idea.	Byaba ari igitekerezo kimwe.
A really good book.	Igitabo cyiza rwose.
But if all goes well.	Ariko niba byose byagenze neza.
My beautiful daughter.	Umukobwa wanjye mwiza.
But he didn't mean to offend.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kuvuga.
It is close now.	Ubu ni hafi.
There is nothing he can do now.	Nta kintu na kimwe ashobora gukora ubu.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
But no one ever heard of it.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wigeze yumva.
I don't know what it would be like.	Sinzi uko byari kugenda.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, sibyo.
This person must be good.	Uyu muntu agomba kuba nta cyiza.
I mean obviously.	Ndashaka kuvuga biragaragara.
I like planning.	Nkunda gahunda.
That's a big deal.	Icyo ni ikintu kinini cyane.
Sometimes, the party is here and there.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibirori hano na hano.
And you can't see.	Kandi ntushobora kureba.
I am your friend.	Ndi inshuti yawe.
And it is.	Kandi ni.
He said you may be right.	Yavuze ko ushobora kuba ufite ukuri.
It's your money.	Ni amafaranga yawe.
But he did nothing wrong.	Ariko nta kibi yigeze akora.
Please let go.	Nyamuneka reka.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka, birashoboka.
I need help.	Nkeneye ubufasha.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
But he.	Ariko we.
Knowing and knowing are not the same.	Kumenya no kumenya ntabwo ari kimwe.
I really hope he does.	Ndizera rwose ko abikora.
I don't know why he didn't.	Sinzi impamvu atabikoze.
I can go back to school.	Nshobora gusubira ku ishuri.
This is true for everyone.	Ibi ni ukuri kuri buri wese.
But not really, maybe.	Ariko sibyo mubyukuri, birashoboka.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
He wants to live.	Ashaka kubaho.
He knew he was right.	Yari azi ko avuga ukuri.
Probably never.	Birashoboka ko ntazigera mbona.
But he had to go.	Ariko yagombaga kugenda.
Anything he asked for.	Ikintu cyose yasabye.
This is his son.	Uyu ni umuhungu we.
But he thought it was good.	Ariko yatekereje ko ari byiza.
You have to talk to.	Ugomba kuvugana na.
If this were the case, I would not say.	Niba ibi byari ikibazo, ntashobora kuvuga.
Being a good and kind person.	Kuba umuntu mwiza kandi mwiza.
He did not know who he was.	Ntiyari azi uwo ari we.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Nothing good to do.	Nta kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
But that’s a good idea.	Ariko ni igitekerezo cyiza.
It will be a wonderful experience.	Bizaba ibintu byiza rwose.
I saw.	Nabonye.
With i.	Hamwe na i.
Maybe we should go.	Ahari tugomba kugenda.
You don't have to make a movie.	Ntugomba gukora firime.
It's all about money.	Bose ni amafaranga.
He left early in the morning.	Yagiye kare mu gitondo.
He never had much luck or reason to drive.	Ntabwo yigeze agira amahirwe menshi cyangwa impamvu yo gutwara.
You got the money.	Wabonye amafaranga.
He was only thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu gusa.
You really need to try this.	Ukeneye rwose kugerageza ibi.
I have something to do.	Mfite ibyo gukora.
For something.	Ku kintu.
It's bad.	Ni mubi.
The idea is not true.	Igitekerezo ntabwo ari ukuri.
I was the only one who saw everything.	Ninjye wenyine nabonye ikintu cyose.
I was at school.	Nari ku ishuri.
He absolutely must.	Agomba rwose.
Seeing something bad.	Kubona ikintu kibi.
He wanted to hear.	Yashakaga kumva.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
You probably had a job alone.	Birashoboka ko wari ufite akazi wenyine.
Not the same today.	Ntabwo ari kimwe muri iki gihe.
This is good.	Iyi ni nziza.
How long do you have to go?	Ugomba kugenda kugeza ryari?
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
Not bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi.
His wife.	Umugore we.
But it looks like he's sitting still.	Ariko birasa nkaho yicaye gato.
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
Where the girl was.	Aho umukobwa yari.
It's almost here.	Ari hafi hano.
And that is all.	Kandi ibyo aribyo byose.
He had to know everything.	Yagombaga kumenya byose.
He was not a child.	Ntiyari umwana.
If you are lucky.	Niba ufite amahirwe.
It's just a family.	Ni umuryango gusa.
He said.	Yavuze.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
It will not be a problem.	Ntabwo bizaba ikibazo.
That's not difficult.	Ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
They were worried.	Bari bafite impungenge.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
The house is beautiful.	Inzu ni nziza.
I was down.	Nari hasi.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
Everyone wants to be close to you.	Umuntu wese arashaka kuba hafi yawe.
Like his father.	Kimwe na se.
But you are human.	Ariko uri umuntu.
I don't know why or when.	Sinzi impamvu cyangwa igihe.
He was not the boy he needed to be.	Ntabwo yari umuhungu yari akeneye kuba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
What do you think	Uratekereza iki?
That's good enough for me.	Nibyiza bihagije kuri njye.
He went alone.	Yagiye wenyine.
This is definitely a good thing.	Ibi rwose ni ibintu byiza.
I work here.	Nkora hano.
You can't be.	Ntushobora kuba.
It was good there.	Byari byiza aho.
All on time.	Byose ku gihe.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
I believe in this reason.	Ndizera iyi mpamvu.
This program was not very good, however.	Iyi gahunda ntabwo yari nziza cyane, ariko.
And no one ever heard of anything.	Kandi nta muntu numwe wigeze yumva ikintu.
You can't wait !.	Ntushobora gutegereza!.
What he said was true.	Ibyo yavuze byari ukuri.
He did not know for sure.	Ntabwo yari azi neza.
The player started playing as a child.	Umukinnyi yatangiye gukina akiri umwana.
I don't know where we are now.	Sinzi aho turi ubu.
He is ashamed.	Afite isoni.
I feel it every day.	Ndumva buri munsi.
They had nothing.	Nta na kimwe bari bafite.
Maybe he has a look.	Ahari yaba afite kureba.
We have a way.	Dufite uburyo.
Everyone in the background.	Buri wese muri nyuma.
There are people.	Hariho abantu.
He had nothing.	Nta cyo yari afite.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
He sat down for a while.	Yicaye gato.
Or he doesn't want to know.	Cyangwa ntabwo yifuza kumenya.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
Both were down.	Bombi bari hasi.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
Since then, no one has seen a boy.	Kuva icyo gihe, nta muntu n'umwe wari wabonye umuhungu.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
She was very nice to him.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri we.
But this is too much.	Ariko ibi ni byinshi cyane.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
Or outside.	Cyangwa hanze.
I want you to think tomorrow.	Ndashaka ko utekereza ejo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I don’t want a party or anything else.	Ntashaka ibirori cyangwa ikindi kintu icyo aricyo cyose.
It’s a gift, he meant.	Ni impano, yashakaga kuvuga.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I'm not at home.	Ntabwo ndi murugo.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I had the last problem.	Nari mfite ikibazo cya nyuma.
But it is not easy at all.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye na gato.
He was here before.	Yari hano mbere.
Your gift.	Impano yawe.
It's not something you can buy.	Ntabwo ari ikintu ushobora kugura.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
You have something else.	Ufite ikindi kintu.
He just needs time.	Akeneye igihe gusa.
I wanted to play.	Nashakaga gukina.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
There is nothing in it.	Nta kintu na kimwe muri we.
But this morning.	Ariko muri iki gitondo.
He wanted to, and he was the only one.	Yashakaga, kandi ni we wenyine.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
Eventually, he got the chance.	Amaherezo, yabonye umwanya.
I am thinking of buying a new car.	Ndatekereza kugura imodoka nshya.
This is you.	Uyu niwowe.
We have to be on top.	Tugomba kuba hejuru.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
Drink if you have to.	Kunywa niba ugomba.
It's not Sunday.	Ntabwo aricyo cyumweru.
Niki ?.	Niki?.
He has no one.	Nta muntu afite.
You just saw it.	Wabonye gusa.
I found the truth.	Nabonye ukuri.
You have to do what you have to do.	Ugomba gukora ibyo ugomba gukora.
Work is not tomorrow.	Akazi ntabwo ari ejo.
You are good to me.	Uri mwiza kuri njye.
You don’t have to do everything.	Ntugomba gukora byose.
Everything is great.	Byose ni byiza cyane.
But we have to do the work.	Ariko tugomba gukora akazi.
She has found great things and works very well.	Yabonye ibintu byiza kandi akora neza cyane.
He was not just a man.	Ntabwo yari umuntu gusa.
He will be here.	Azaba hano.
We are where we are.	Turi aho turi.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
Do it today.	Kubikora kuri uyu munsi.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The food here is excellent.	Ibiryo hano ni byiza cyane.
I am looking for a place of my own.	Ndashaka umwanya wenyine wenyine.
You can try.	Urashobora kugerageza.
It was a lot for him.	Byari byinshi kuri we.
That is not the case with everyone.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri bose.
I don't have to.	Ntagomba.
He thought it was very easy.	Yatekereje ko byoroshye cyane.
I know nothing about myself.	Ntacyo nzi kuri njye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo bishoboka.
It was a learning process.	Byari gahunda yo kwiga.
And you only want one.	Kandi ushaka umwe gusa.
He was too.	Na we yari we.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
You can make a lot of money.	Urashobora kubona amafaranga menshi.
He spoke quickly.	Yavuze vuba vuba.
She decided to go and eat.	Yahisemo kujya kurya.
Everyone wants money!	Umuntu wese arashaka amafaranga!
I would like to have a massage.	Ndashaka hejuru.
He is a bad guy.	Ni umusore mubi.
Whatever you want.	Ibyo ushaka byose.
A really long time.	Igihe kinini rwose.
No one told him where he was going.	Nta muntu n'umwe yabwiye aho agiye.
But that's not what you want.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo ushaka.
He is not really one of us.	Mubyukuri ntabwo ari umwe muri twe.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
There is so much you can do.	Hariho byinshi cyane ushobora gukora.
I don't know the problem.	Sinzi ikibazo.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
It was a beautiful night.	Muri iri joro yari mwiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That was all.	Ibyo byari byose.
He may also be good.	Ashobora no kuba mwiza.
Looking for something else?	Urashaka ikindi kintu?
It was always the best thing ever.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane buri gihe.
What do they know?	Ni iki bazi?.
You have to do this.	Ugomba gukora ibi.
I want to do something else.	Ndashaka gukora ikindi kintu.
Looks like it's possible.	Birasa nkaho bishoboka.
He left this morning.	Yagiye kuva muri iki gitondo.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
That's a long time.	Icyo ni igihe kinini.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
He has something to say.	Hari icyo avuga.
I wonder where he went.	Ndabaza aho yagiye.
He went away from you.	Yagiye kure yawe.
He never liked this.	Ntabwo yigeze akunda ibi.
A little thing.	Ikintu gito.
Did you know that?	Wari uziko aribyo.
No one knew exactly what to do.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi neza icyo yari gukora.
I was one.	Nari umwe.
But one.	Ariko umwe.
He did not want to drink or eat.	Ntiyashakaga kunywa cyangwa ibiryo.
What do you do?	Ukora iki?.
I had a long time.	Nagize igihe kirekire.
He hopes to return to work soon.	Yizeye gusubira mu kazi vuba aha.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
That's right.	Nibyo.
This one was young.	Uyu yari muto.
It's good too.	Nibyiza kandi.
He must be in school.	Agomba kuba mu ishuri.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
Probably not all.	Birashoboka ko atari byose.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He didn't want anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga.
You can't do that tonight.	Ntushobora kubikora iri joro.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
What do you think about this ?.	Uratekereza iki kuri ibi?.
I can't wait to hear what happened.	Sinshobora gutegereza kumva uko byagenze.
This is exactly what happened.	Ibi nibyo rwose.
I see a mistake.	Mbona amakosa.
They were scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba.
I was not a child.	Sinari umwana.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kubikora.
Is that all?	Ibyo aribyo byose?
He is scared, and he has a reason.	Afite ubwoba, kandi afite impamvu.
He should know that by now.	Agomba kumenya ko kugeza ubu.
You must not make mistakes.	Ntugomba gukora amakosa.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I deserve it.	Nkwiye.
I don't need anything.	Ntacyo nkeneye.
I don’t know much about any of that.	Ntabwo nzi byinshi kuri kimwe muri ibyo.
But this was above all.	Ariko ibi byari hejuru.
Tonight after returning home it would be great.	Iri joro nyuma yo gusubira murugo byaba byiza.
A gifted young man.	Umusore ufite impano.
I don’t like to think too much.	Ntabwo nkunda gutekereza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, byari byinshi.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu ibyo aribyo.
This was a mistake.	Ibi byari amakosa.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
You should have talked to him.	Wari ukwiye kuvugana nawe.
And in fact.	Kandi mubyukuri.
It’s not always a good thing.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari ikintu cyiza.
No one has said anything about it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze avuga ikintu kuri ibyo.
He seemed to have never heard of it.	Yasaga naho atigeze yumva.
Who knows where.	Ninde uzi aho.
Smart boy	Umuhungu uzi ubwenge.
I was very young.	Nari muto cyane.
We are not here.	Ntabwo turi hano.
That's what happened.	Ni ko byagenze.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe.
I don’t want to tell anyone.	Sinshaka kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I hope so with you.	Nizere ko nawe.
But all that is good.	Ariko ibyo byose nibyiza.
You think back.	Utekereza inyuma.
She got her favorite gift.	Yabonye impano yakundaga.
Money first.	Amafaranga mbere.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
He had none.	Nta n'umwe yari afite.
But close.	Ariko hafi.
That's not what we need.	Ntabwo aribyo dukeneye.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
I'm not sure what that is.	Sinzi neza icyo aricyo.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibyo nibyo rwose.
He wanted faith.	Yashakaga kwizera.
He used to talk and talk.	Yakundaga kuvuga no kuvuga.
I think it would be very difficult.	Ntekereza ko byaba bigoye cyane.
It's early in the morning.	Hari mu gitondo cya kare.
Well, at least we didn't go down without explaining ourselves first.	Nibyo, birashoboka ko turi.
You have to take the time.	Ugomba gufata umwanya.
His wife never loved children.	Umugore we ntabwo yigeze akunda abana.
I have been here ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe ndi hano.
It seems simple enough.	Birasa naho byoroshye bihagije.
He was probably scared.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ubwoba.
It's your fault.	Ni amakosa yawe.
It was not us.	Ntabwo byari twe.
He did a lot.	Yakoze byinshi.
I know they are out.	Nzi ko bari hanze.
I can't do much.	Sinshobora gukora byinshi.
If you want to study, you have to study hard.	Niba ushaka kwiga, ugomba kwiga cyane.
He heard it all.	Yumvise byose.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
You are doing well.	Urimo ukora neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa.
Money.	Amafaranga.
But he went too far.	Ariko yagiye kure cyane.
I need	Nkeneye.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo ari cyo.
We can't leave.	Ntidushobora kuva.
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
Everyone wants to play every day.	Umuntu wese arashaka gukina buri munsi.
I mean, you really don't do anything.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri ntacyo ukora.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
My best friend.	Inshuti yanjye nziza.
I understand what you are looking for.	Ndumva icyo urimo gushaka.
If not, then so be it.	Niba kandi atari byo.
For many, it was not a big deal.	Kuri benshi, ntabwo byari ikibazo kinini.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Money is almost easy.	Amafaranga hafi byoroshye.
You are one of them.	Uri umwe muri we.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Another problem.	Ikindi kibazo.
Nothing at all.	Nta na kimwe rwose.
And that is true.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri.
I have no problem with that.	Ntabwo mfite ikibazo na gito kuri ibyo.
He has no.	Ntabwo afite.
I know you know that.	Nzi ko uzi uko.
It is my hair.	Ni umusatsi wanjye.
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
Everything was.	Ibintu byose yari.
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza.
It was a lot of things.	Byari ibintu byinshi cyane.
The best is possible.	Nibyiza cyane birashoboka.
I mean, you can.	Ndashaka kuvuga, urashobora.
He was a good friend.	Yari inshuti nziza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
We have to get out of here.	Tugomba kuva hano.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
He had a book.	Yari afite igitabo.
He knew what he was doing.	Yari azi ibyo yakoze.
He would not be on the phone.	Ntabwo yari kuva kuri terefone.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora kuri ibyo.
He had it now.	Yari afite ubu.
I love the program so much.	Nkunda gahunda cyane.
But he would do it.	Ariko yari kubikora.
I was going to take time off.	Nari ngiye gufata umwanya wo kugenda.
he says.	avuga.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
Questions?	Ibibazo?
You have no home income.	Ntabwo ufite amafaranga yo murugo.
Nothing to do, nothing to do.	Nta kintu cyo gukora, nta gukora.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
He tried but could not speak.	Yagerageje ariko ntashobora kuvuga.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
She chose to help the dog.	Yahisemo gufasha imbwa.
There is a woman here.	Hano hari umugore.
It's been a long time coming.	Yagiye igihe kirekire.
He was completely alone.	Yari wenyine rwose.
She asked her son to return.	Yasabye umuhungu we gutaha.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
It's because he's at home.	Ni uko ari murugo.
Or did he do it.	Cyangwa yigeze kubikora.
And he was alone.	Kandi yari wenyine.
I think you can do better.	Ndatekereza ko ushobora gukora neza.
I have heard that food is good.	Numvise ko ibiryo ari byiza.
It was a great plan.	Byari gahunda nziza.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
I just make money.	Gusa mbona amafaranga.
Much easier.	Byinshi byoroshye.
I have something to do.	Mfite icyo gukora.
He never thought.	Ntiyigeze atekereza.
If possible.	Niba bishoboka.
You can't do everything.	Ntushobora gukora byose.
It works well.	Akora neza.
You have to read everything you can see.	Ugomba gusoma ibintu byose ushobora kubona.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I don't know much about it.	Sinzi byinshi kuri byo.
I know you're scared.	Nzi ko ufite ubwoba.
I just didn't understand what it was.	Gusa sinigeze numva icyo aricyo.
I know he does.	Nzi ko abikora.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
And it's okay if you're good.	Kandi nibyiza niba wari mwiza.
I like a lot of things.	Nkunda ibintu byinshi.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I wanted to be.	Nashakaga kuba.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva uri hasi cyane uyumunsi.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
I knew you were younger than me.	Nari nzi ko uri muto kundusha.
Drink it all.	Kunywa byose.
We can't talk to him, so far.	Ntidushobora kuvugana na we, kugeza ubu.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
It was not his thing.	Ntabwo yari ikintu cye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not good.	Rimwe na rimwe ni byiza, rimwe na rimwe si byiza.
Kinini.	Kinini.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
Trying to think.	Kugerageza gutekereza.
I didn't want to leave.	Sinifuzaga kuva aho.
In his first week there was a lot to catch.	Mu cyumweru cye cya mbere hari byinshi byo gufata.
And this is my dog.	Kandi iyi ni imbwa yanjye.
I have a good idea.	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza.
I can't wait for you.	Sinshobora gutegereza nawe.
It's really good.	Mubyukuri ni byiza.
For all.	Kuri bose.
I have everything.	Mfite ibintu byose.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
Or do something else.	Cyangwa gukora ikindi kintu.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
You have to wait.	Ugomba gutegereza.
It’s not really about being together.	Ntabwo rwose ari kubana.
Everyone wants money.	Umuntu wese arashaka amafaranga.
To his father.	Kuri se.
Of course not.	Nibyo ntabwo.
From where you are.	Kuva aho uri.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
The problem is time.	Ikibazo ni umwanya.
There are so many people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi cyane.
They are on schedule.	Bari muri gahunda.
I am in school.	Ndi mwishuri.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
Soon, it is possible.	Vuba, birashoboka.
Luck was behind him.	Amahirwe yari inyuma ye.
A lot to do.	Byinshi byo gukora.
I just feel like it's time to go home.	Gusa numva ari igihe cyo gutaha.
You think about everything.	Utekereza kuri byose.
I don't know what.	Sinzi icyo.
he wanted to know.	yashakaga kumenya.
Take a job.	Gufata akazi.
I don’t think he had much.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko yari afite byinshi.
But this is true.	Ariko ibi ni byo.
I know exactly where it is.	Nzi neza aho ari.
I don't know what to do wrong.	Sinzi icyo nkora nabi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo kandi nibyo.
But sometimes you have to look ahead.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe ugomba kureba imbere.
But his father was right.	Ariko se yari afite ukuri.
What did he mean? 	Yashakaga kuvuga iki?
Isn't he lucky?	Ntabwo afite amahirwe?
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba hano.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I don't like it in me.	Ntabwo nkunda muri njye.
I don’t want you to have it.	Sinshaka ko ushobora kugira.
Chances are.	Amahirwe.
He went inside the room.	Yagiye imbere mu cyumba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
I was in that.	Nari muri ibyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It wasn’t too much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi cyane.
I have a house.	Mfite inzu.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
You can do better.	Urashobora gukora neza.
I didn't know where he could be.	Sinari nzi aho ashobora kuba.
There is no phone here.	Nta terefone hano.
And they would be right.	Kandi bari kuba bafite ukuri.
I guess that's possible.	Ndakeka ko bishoboka.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I don't know much about him.	Ntabwo nzi byinshi kuri we.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Apparently he didn't know what to do.	Biragaragara ko atari azi icyo gukora.
Everything you love is what you are going to do.	Ibyo ukunda byose nibyo ugiye gukora.
He does nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora.
He went to work.	Yagiye ku kazi.
Big is good.	Kinini ni byiza.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
But this was just above.	Ariko ibi byari hejuru gusa.
Not good enough for my needs.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije kubyo nkeneye.
It was all.	Byari byose.
Chances are.	Amahirwe.
This is a family.	Ubu ni umuryango.
At the time, I didn't think much of it.	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo ari amafaranga yanjye.
It was just an idea.	Byari igitekerezo gusa.
Pretty girl, really.	Umukobwa mwiza cyane, mubyukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
Are you sure you want to view this?	Uzi neza ko ushaka kubona ibi?
I wanted to do it.	Nashakaga kubikora.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It was not all.	Ntabwo byari byose.
He chose to act instead of thinking.	Yahisemo gukora aho gutekereza.
For both.	Kuri bombi.
They are scared.	Bafite ubwoba.
Someone behind him.	Hari umuntu inyuma ye.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
he says.	avuga.
It was good to go again.	Byari byiza kongera kugenda.
Food is a good thing.	Ibiryo ni ikintu cyiza.
Not really enough.	Ntabwo bihagije rwose.
Please stop!	Nyamuneka reka kureka!
You can't say.	Ntushobora kuvuga.
You are right.	Waba ufite ukuri.
And good.	Kandi nziza.
I wanted to be human.	Nashakaga kuba umuntu.
Watching a really good movie.	Kureba firime nziza rwose.
No problem here.	Nta kibazo hano.
And no.	Kandi ntabwo.
We just have to see.	Tugomba kubona gusa.
Looking for something to read?	Urashaka ikintu cyo gusoma?
I really saw it.	Nabonye rwose.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
He asked that morning.	Yabajije icyo gitondo.
There is only one person.	Hariho umuntu umwe gusa.
There is so much we can do.	Hariho ibintu byinshi dushobora gukora.
He has to go now.	Agomba kugenda ubu.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
I really enjoyed the opportunity.	Nishimiye amahirwe cyane.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje kuri icyo kibazo.
And you can't say.	Kandi ntushobora kuvuga.
She was as beautiful as ever.	Yari mwiza cyane nka mbere.
He didn't want to do anything.	Ntiyashakaga gukora ikintu na kimwe.
He said he couldn't see what he was doing.	Yavuze ko adashobora kubona icyo akora.
If you were here.	Niba wari hano.
It was just scary.	Byari ubwoba gusa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You were probably at work.	Birashoboka ko wari ku kazi.
I didn't know that.	Sinari nzi icyo.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
If we have to.	Niba tugomba.
It was really easy to learn things here.	Byari byoroshye rwose kwiga ibintu hano.
I don't know how you did it.	Sinzi uko wabikoze.
Please, please, please.	Nyamuneka, nyamuneka, nyamuneka.
He seemed reluctant to go.	Yasaga naho adashaka kugenda.
It is not good, but it is true.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko byari ukuri.
We have to stay here for a while.	Tugomba kuguma hano gato.
She looked good enough.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza bihagije.
Wherever he is he is very lucky.	Aho yaba afite amahirwe menshi.
Her hair was beautiful.	Umusatsi we wari usa neza.
I was out and about.	Nari hanze kandi hafi.
And he didn't want to go.	Kandi ntiyashakaga kugenda.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He feels like he wants to say more.	Yumva asa naho ashaka kuvuga byinshi.
But he had to be there.	Ariko yagombaga kuba ahari.
He felt enough.	Yumvise bihagije.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And it was good to think.	Kandi byari byiza gutekereza.
No one knew anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi ikintu.
We are in one now.	Turi muri umwe ubu.
It is not his family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango we.
I mean, not really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo mubyukuri.
Niki.	Niki.
You have a great idea.	Ufite igitekerezo cyiza.
Maybe younger.	Ahari muto.
That's what a boy does here.	Nibyo umuhungu akora hano.
What he was thinking was something else.	Icyo yatekerezaga ni ikindi kintu.
I'm sure he's not.	Nzi neza ko atari we.
You don't know what happened.	Ntabwo uzi uko byagenze.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga.
I also love the inside out.	Nkunda kandi imbere imbere.
This is him.	Uyu ni we.
That’s not really a problem.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikibazo.
At work.	Ku kazi.
Please, please.	Nyamuneka, nyamuneka.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He did not have a car.	Ntabwo yari afite imodoka.
I thought it was really good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza rwose.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, nibyo.
You may feel very bad.	Urashobora kumva nabi cyane.
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
But, but, but.	Ariko, ariko, ariko.
I had nothing.	Nta na kimwe nari mfite.
I'm not sure what to do.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo gukora.
He knew who he was.	Yari azi uwo ari we.
He can stay.	Arashobora kuguma.
That he cannot live without.	Ibyo adashobora kubana adafite.
Or a boy.	Cyangwa umuhungu.
It’s not just an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa.
It will be much, much better.	Bizaba byinshi, byiza cyane.
He hadn't looked far.	Ntabwo yari yarebye kure na gato.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo rwose.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I can't see.	Ntashobora kubona.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
This is the same thing.	Iki kintu kimwe.
He went.	Yagiye.
I can tell people to do things.	Nshobora kubwira abantu gukora ibintu.
Not at all.	Igihe kimwe ntabwo.
And you can't either.	Kandi nawe ntushobora.
It's home.	Ni gutaha.
He wanted to be something else.	Yashakaga kuba ikindi kintu.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
For him, and for me.	Kuri we, no kuri njye.
I am learning so much.	Ndimo kwiga byinshi cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I had a lot.	Nari mfite byinshi.
But there was not much they could do about it.	Ariko nta byinshi bari gukora kuri ibyo.
He said he was right.	Yavuze ko yari afite ukuri.
I didn't know what he was talking about.	Sinari nzi ibyo avuga.
I want to know everything.	Ndashaka kumenya byose.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
You like to win.	Ukunda gutsinda.
I'm going home.	Ngiye gutaha.
He did.	Yabikoze.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I like to be outside.	Nkunda kuba hanze.
Really good friends.	Mubyukuri inshuti nziza.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko bishoboka rwose ko yari afite ukuri.
Only. 	Gusa.
'	'
I really have.	Mfite rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I was so scared I didn't know what to do.	Nagize ubwoba cyane sinzi icyo gukora.
That was good.	Iyo yari nziza.
You don't have the money to do it.	Ntabwo ufite amafaranga yo kubikora.
It was his house.	Yari inzu ye.
They were not very close.	Ntabwo bari hafi cyane.
I was not afraid.	Ntabwo nagize ubwoba.
You are my friend.	Uri inshuti yanjye.
I think we have to work.	Ntekereza ko tugomba gukora.
I hope he does.	Ndizera ko abikora.
He is not eating.	Ntabwo arimo kurya.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
We have to move forward.	Tugomba kujya imbere.
I knew it then.	Nari nzi icyo gihe.
He is doing it alone.	Arimo kubikora wenyine.
He did not know why.	Ntiyari azi impamvu.
Very nice guy	Umusore mwiza cyane.
You have to do what you want.	Ukwiye gukora ibyo ushaka.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I feel lucky.	Ndumva mfite amahirwe.
I didn't think of anything.	Ntabwo natekerezaga ikintu na kimwe.
Like faith, he came to me.	Kimwe no kwizera, yaje kuri njye.
He was not ready to do that.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye kubikora.
One for each of us.	Umwe kuri buri wese muri twe.
I really needed the money.	Nari nkeneye amafaranga rwose.
This is your chance.	Ubu ni amahirwe yawe menshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
In fact, it is possible.	Mubyukuri, birashoboka rwose.
But there is a big problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kinini.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
The last thing.	Ikintu cya nyuma.
I saw it nearby.	Nabonye hafi.
It would be easy to see.	Byaba byoroshye kubona.
He used to have problems at school.	Yakundaga kugira ibibazo ku ishuri.
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
We are friends now.	Ubu turi inshuti.
They were close.	Bari hafi.
Everything and everyone.	Byose na buri wese.
Good for him, man.	Nibyiza kuri we, muntu.
He was in his room.	Yari mu cyumba cye.
I don't like a guy.	Ntabwo nkunda umusore.
Especially for me.	Cyane cyane kuri njye.
She was very nice and nice.	Yari mwiza cyane kandi mwiza.
He used to see the boy alone.	Yakundaga kubona umuhungu aho wenyine.
Just a problem.	Gusa ikibazo.
He got it right.	Yabonye neza.
But it was true.	Ariko byari ukuri.
They are absolutely smart.	Bafite ubwenge rwose.
I can't do that right now.	Sinshobora kubikora nonaha.
We had nothing to eat.	Ntabwo twari dufite icyo kurya.
I don't need it now.	Ntabwo nkeneye ubu.
I want to read a book.	Ndashaka gusoma igitabo.
Everything was normal.	Byose byari bisanzwe.
I mean, that.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko.
He was only thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu gusa.
If only you could think.	Niba ushobora gutekereza gusa.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, nibyo rwose.
Good baby	Umwana mwiza.
I didn't want anything.	Ntacyo nashakaga.
As long as we need to be.	Igihe cyose dukeneye kuba.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
It was all about him.	Yari byose kuri we.
He tried to see.	Yagerageje kubona.
I saw it, but not really.	Nabonye, ​​ariko ntabwo mubyukuri.
'Yes'.	'ya'.
That's the big deal.	Icyo ni ikibazo kinini.
I don’t know how to live.	Ntazi uburyo bwo kubaho.
He just asked questions.	Yabajije ibibazo gusa.
She really enjoyed the party.	Yishimiye cyane ibirori.
But he was really scared.	Ariko rwose yari afite ubwoba.
Tonight, you're going to help.	Iri joro, ugiye gufasha.
He had one too.	Yari afite umwe cyane.
I like.	Nkunda.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's not really money.	Ntabwo rwose ari amafaranga.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
For me, this is the time.	Kuri njye, uyu ni umwanya.
It was not very good.	Ntiyari mwiza cyane.
And almost everyone.	Kandi hafi ya bose.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
But you have very little time to do much.	Ariko ufite umwanya muto cyane wo gukora byinshi.
He probably expected you to do the same.	Birashoboka ko yari yiteze ko nawe abikora.
He did not know how long he had been.	Ntiyari azi igihe yamaze.
This is also not the case.	Ibi kandi ntabwo aribyo.
He just made a mistake.	Yakoze amakosa gusa.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
He said he had a plan.	Yavuze ko yari afite gahunda.
And that would be, really, really good.	Kandi ibyo byaba, mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
I'm really here.	Ndi hano rwose.
I see no one after him.	Nta muntu mbona nyuma ye.
I think it's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
It's not time.	Ntabwo ari igihe.
There is definitely something here.	Hano hari rwose.
All the best.	Ibintu byiza byose.
I didn’t know if this was normal.	Sinari nzi niba ibi byari bisanzwe.
I did this.	Nakoze ibi.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
As he had his place to be.	Nkuko yari afite aho agomba kuba.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
This was really good.	Ibi byari byiza rwose.
Bombi.	Bombi.
I like things.	Nkunda ibintu.
We have to stay together.	Tugomba kuguma hamwe.
I want to work harder and play harder.	Ndashaka gukora cyane no gukina cyane.
We have to live.	Tugomba kubaho.
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.
It is not his fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I saw this program recently.	Nabonye iyi gahunda vuba aha.
We can't go back now.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
You.	Wowe.
He had been gone for a long time.	Yari yagiye igihe kirekire.
There is so much to do,	Hariho byinshi byo gukora,
But it was not on time.	Ariko ntiyari mu gihe.
He did not know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo yari kuvuga.
He has no job.	Nta kazi afite.
You don't have to.	Ntugomba.
When he was a dog.	Iyo yari imbwa.
But I can't think of that.	Ariko ntashobora gutekereza kuri ibyo.
Everyone had to leave.	Umuntu wese yagombaga kuva.
It will be good to know how to do it.	Bizaba byiza kumenya kubikora.
But for everyone.	Ariko kuri buri wese.
They have good things.	Bafite ibintu byiza.
He knew he shouldn't.	Yari azi ko atagomba.
For me I see they know we are here.	Kuri njye mbona bazi ko turi hano.
He has never done that before.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora mbere.
He said he had.	Yavuze ko afite.
As for the boy.	Naho umuhungu.
I thought something.	Natekereje ko hari ikintu.
Well worth a look.	Byiza gutegereza.
I need to hear what you think.	Nkeneye kumva icyo utekereza.
Anyone can do it.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
He felt anxious.	Yumvise afite impungenge.
And existence is.	Kandi kubaho ni.
But then.	Ariko icyo gihe.
He needed to know.	Yari akeneye kumenya.
'	'
For him, alone.	Kuri we, wenyine.
I didn't know where we were.	Sinari nzi aho turi.
It's one day.	Ni umunsi umwe.
I want to be a guy one day.	Ndashaka kuba umusore umunsi umwe.
I didn't know all that.	Sinari nzi ibyo byose.
I should know better.	Nkwiye kumenya neza.
She is worried.	Afite impungenge.
You can definitely see and hear everything here, too.	Urashobora rwose kubona no kumva ibintu byose hano, kandi.
This is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibi.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
He did not think that his opinion was wrong.	Ntabwo yatekerezaga ko igitekerezo cye atari cyo.
Especially with him.	Cyane cyane na we.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
They would buy nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe bari kugura.
It seems to be the case.	Birasa nkaho ari byo.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I didn't know what to do outside.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora hanze.
He says why.	Avuga impamvu.
He could not go far.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kujya kure.
He thought for a moment before speaking.	Yatekereje gato mbere yuko avuga.
For many it was too much.	Kuri benshi byari byinshi cyane.
People may not have it.	Abantu ashobora kuba adafite.
Only one time.	Igihe kimwe gusa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
And everyone, really.	Kandi abantu bose, mubyukuri.
I have nothing and no house.	Ntacyo ndimo nta nzu.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
I just wanted to be me.	Nashakaga gusa kuba njye.
You do nothing.	Ntacyo ukora.
A lot of time to think here.	Igihe kinini cyo gutekereza hano.
I think we need that.	Ntekereza ko dukeneye ibyo.
It was good to wait !.	Byari byiza gutegereza!.
He saw nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
It was really nice to watch.	Byari byiza rwose kureba.
Either his wife, or.	Yaba umugore we, cyangwa se.
We were downstairs.	Twari umuntu uri hasi.
It's just going well.	Ari kugenda gusa neza.
I didn’t want him to hear this.	Sinifuzaga ko yumva ibi.
He must have been right.	Agomba kuba yari afite ukuri.
There is a chance he never thought before.	Hariho amahirwe atigeze atekereza mbere.
He would not swim too much.	Ntiyari koga cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
But children.	Ariko abana.
I didn’t know why or how.	Sinari nzi impamvu cyangwa uburyo.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
However, he did a lot.	Ariko, yakoze byinshi.
I don't want to think about anything.	Sinshaka gutekereza ku kintu na kimwe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ikibazo cyiza.
This is a dog.	Iyi ni imbwa.
But I also don’t do everything.	Ariko nanjye ntabwo nkora byose.
He is going to walk over you.	Agiye kugenda hejuru yawe.
It was a boy.	Byari umuhungu.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
he said before.	yavuze mbere.
I just didn't know it.	Gusa sinari nzi neza.
I mean, yes, but it's not.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ni, ariko sibyo.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
He had to go and do that.	Yagombaga kujya gukora ibyo.
He can play anything.	Arashobora gukina ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But I don’t have to.	Ariko ntagomba.
You too can believe the same thing.	Nawe urashobora kwizera ikintu kimwe.
Obviously that is it.	Biragaragara ko aribyo.
I don't know what to do.	Ntazi icyo agomba gukora.
I'm ashamed.	Mfite isoni.
He told me.	Yambwiye.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Upstairs as soon as possible.	Hejuru vuba bishoboka.
This is true.	Ubu ni ukuri.
We are so close to winning.	Turi hafi cyane yo gutsinda.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
In fact, nothing.	Mubyukuri, ntacyo.
That's what he does.	Nibyo akora.
I am human, and I am human.	Ndi umuntu, kandi ndi umuntu.
No one has seen it here.	Nta muntu wabonye hano kuri ibi.
Only, no.	Gusa, ntabwo.
Who he wanted.	Uwo yashakaga.
However, this is not the case here.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
But not for long.	Ariko si igihe kirekire.
You are not sure what it is.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo aricyo.
Finding a job was difficult.	Kubona akazi byari bigoye.
In all things.	Muri byose.
Early in the morning	Mu gitondo cya kare.
Out with you	Hanze nawe.
It is possible to drink only one or the other.	Birashoboka kunywa gusa cyangwa ikindi.
But not any book.	Ariko si igitabo icyo ari cyo cyose.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
He just tried to help.	Yagerageje gusa gufasha.
But sometimes it is possible.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.
That’s good advice.	Iyo ni inama nziza.
But you were right.	Ariko wari ufite ukuri.
He won't do it, he can't.	Ntabwo azabikora, ntashobora.
But he has to do it right.	Ariko agomba gukora neza kubikora.
It's really inside.	Ni imbere rwose.
In fact, this is true.	Mubyukuri, ibi ni ukuri.
He desperately needed help.	Yari akeneye cyane ubufasha.
He must know his place.	Agomba kumenya umwanya we.
We can't be too far away.	Ntidushobora kuba kure cyane.
Obviously.	Biragaragara rwose.
We were.	Twari .
I thought of him.	Natekereje kuri we.
Sometimes, it’s best to go ahead.	Rimwe na rimwe, ni byiza kujya imbere.
To say	Kuvuga.
We must find the opportunity.	Tugomba kubona amahirwe.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
I wanted to be better than that.	Nashakaga kuba mwiza kurenza ibyo.
Only I can do it.	Ninjye wenyine ushobora kubikora.
He went.	Yagiye.
Anyone.	Numuntu uwo ari we wese.
I was behind him.	Nari inyuma ye.
However, there is a chance.	Ariko, hariho amahirwe.
I have my car.	Mfite imodoka yanjye.
He had to do what he had to do.	Yagombaga gukora ibyo yagombaga gukora.
Maybe this is possible.	Ahari ibi birashoboka.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
They know what happened.	Bazi uko byagenze.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Her son.	Umuhungu we.
It would be nice if he did.	Byari byiza ko abikora.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
I have the same book.	Mfite igitabo kimwe.
I saw.	Nabonye.
We are not.	Ntabwo turi.
It's something.	Ni ikintu.
I have the same thing.	Mfite ikintu kimwe.
She is doing what she loves now.	Arimo akora ibyo akunda ubu.
And they were right.	Kandi bari bafite ukuri.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze rwose.
He wanted to know more.	Yashakaga kumenya byinshi.
In all things.	Muri byose.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
I knew it was bad.	Nari nzi ko ari mubi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Or before him.	Cyangwa imbere ye.
That question.	Icyo kibazo.
I have a lot of problems.	Mfite ibibazo byinshi.
I mean,.	Ndashaka kuvuga,.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
This is a movie.	Ni iyi firime.
But most people.	Ariko abantu benshi.
She was just a girl.	Yari umukobwa gusa.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
But he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ariko yari azi ko agomba kugira icyo akora.
The truth.	Ukuri.
What do you mean? 	Nibyo ushaka kuvuga?
It's up to him.	Ni kuri we.
There is no reason to do that.	Nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
He had nothing.	Ntabwo yari afite ikintu na kimwe.
The woman lives alone.	Umugore aba wenyine.
Opinion! 	Igitekerezo!
he says.	avuga.
All alone.	Byose wenyine.
They all knew who he was.	Bose bari bazi uwo ari we.
I was beautiful.	Nari mwiza.
We have a lot of work to do.	Dufite byinshi byo gufata byo gukora.
Tell your family.	Mbwira umuryango wawe.
He wants to be here.	Ashaka kuba hano.
I was just scared.	Nagize ubwoba gusa.
Everyone needs to do it.	Umuntu wese akeneye kubikora.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I want this.	Ndashaka ibi.
How do you do that?	Nigute ukora iki?
We are in this together.	Turi muri ibi hamwe.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka kandi.
The teacher went backwards.	Umwarimu yagiye inyuma.
I think this is the case.	Ntekereza ko ibi aribyo.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
If you can help that would be great.	Niba ushobora gufasha ibyo byaba byiza.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi sibyo.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
And he will do it.	Kandi azabikora.
I am three years old.	Mfite imyaka itatu.
In people.	Muri abantu.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
Glad he did.	Yishimiye ko yabikoze.
And you know why.	Kandi uzi impamvu.
We have to be.	Tugomba kuba.
It's after dinner.	Ari nyuma yo kurya.
He said he was.	Yavuze ko ari.
I needed help.	Nari nkeneye ubufasha.
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
Apparently that was not what he was expecting.	Biragaragara ko atari byo yari yiteze ko avuga.
I can't let this happen.	Sinshobora kureka ibi.
I can work all day.	Nshobora gukora umunsi wose.
He says that's it.	Avuga ko aribyo.
I wanted to do it again.	Nashakaga kongera kubikora.
But he was still very good.	Ariko yari akiri mwiza cyane.
He feels good.	Yumva neza.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
Not very likely.	Ntabwo bishoboka cyane.
This one was my friend.	Uyu yari inshuti yanjye.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Things were good at the time.	Icyo gihe ibintu byari byiza.
Here they are.	Hano bari.
And that's probably the problem.	Kandi birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I don't know how to do this.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo bwo gukora ibi.
You had.	Wari ufite.
I did exactly what you said.	Nakoze neza ibyo wavuze.
It was not a party.	Ntabwo yari ibirori.
He has to eat something.	Agomba kurya ikintu.
He had a hearing problem.	Yagize ikibazo cyo kumva ikibazo.
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
I just want to be nice.	Gusa ndashaka kuba mwiza.
They really weren’t.	Ntabwo rwose bari.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
I think you are.	Ndatekereza ko uri.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje kuri ibi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka mbere.
Good luck to everyone.	Amahirwe kuri buri wese.
There is a lot of money here.	Hano hari amafaranga menshi.
He did a little job.	Yakoze akazi gato.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I need to go, you too.	Nkeneye kugenda, nawe nawe.
Here, one should not try to think, one must understand.	Hano, umuntu ntagomba kugerageza gutekereza, agomba kumva.
The job is too big for him.	Akazi ni kinini kuri we.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
Not much for me.	Ntabwo ari byinshi kuri njye.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I would say the same thing.	Nari kuvuga ikintu kimwe.
That's a lot for me.	Ibyo ni byinshi kuri njye.
It's his car.	Ni imodoka ye.
Here.	Ibi.
But there are problems.	Ariko hariho ibibazo.
He would know what to do.	Yari kumenya icyo gukora.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
What you said at the time was good.	Ibyo wavuze icyo gihe byari byiza.
It was not a big deal.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo kinini.
I have every problem.	Mfite ikibazo cyose.
I'm not anyone.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu wese.
From now on everything was down.	Kuva aha byose byari hasi.
It is also possible to take a car.	Birashoboka kandi gufata imodoka.
He has gone too far with someone he does not know.	Yagiye kure n'umuntu atazi.
You do what you need to do.	Ukora ibyo ukeneye gukora.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
Not now, too early.	Ntabwo ari ubu, kare cyane.
In fact, they are here.	Mubyukuri, bari hano.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
I have nothing to do.	Nta kintu mfite cyo gukora.
You can be the best you can be.	Urashobora kuba mwiza ushobora kuba.
20 all together.	20 bose hamwe.
I'm not in jail.	Ntabwo ndi muri gereza.
But in the short term.	Ariko mugihe gito.
I have this.	Mfite ibi.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
With us.	Natwe.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
If you want to win, you need a friend.	Niba ushaka gutsinda, ukeneye inshuti.
And there are a lot of problems.	Kandi hariho ibibazo byinshi.
We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari kubana neza.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
There is only one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gusa.
But he can't stop.	Ariko ntashobora guhagarika.
We can't know.	Ntidushobora kumenya.
You have to do it now.	Ugomba gukora ubu.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
He was very skilled.	Yari umuhanga cyane.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo aribyo.
I don't believe this is enough.	Ntabwo nizera ko ibi bihagije.
She wants to know where her baby is.	Ashaka kumenya aho umwana we ari.
You or he may have a job.	Wowe cyangwa arashobora kugira akazi.
This is what it looks like.	Ibi nibyo asa.
Especially when you are friends.	Cyane cyane iyo uri inshuti.
You are the only one.	Ni wowe wenyine.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ni umukobwa mwiza.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
You have to do something. 	Ugomba kugira icyo ukora. 
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
are you working today ?.	urimo ukora uyu munsi?.
I just want to make sure that it is.	Gusa ndashaka kumenya neza ko aribyo.
It's the same.	Ni kimwe.
Your friend is nice, nice.	Inshuti yawe nziza, nziza.
All right now.	Byose ubu.
We have to win.	Tugomba gutsinda.
This is before you do it.	Ibi ni mbere yo kubikora.
I knew this was true.	Nari nzi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It would not have been so difficult.	Ntabwo byari kuba bigoye cyane.
You need the same.	Ukeneye kimwe.
'.	'.
I'm not sure if it's possible today.	Ntabwo nzi neza niba bishoboka muri iki gihe.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
I did really well.	Nakoze neza mubyukuri.
Really like him.	Mubyukuri nka we.
In fact, he also has no job.	Mubyukuri, nawe nta kazi afite.
You want to be scared.	Ushaka kubona ubwoba.
He wouldn't tell me why.	Ntabwo yari kumbwira impamvu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Sometimes, this is true.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibi ni ukuri.
I think he is the closest person to me.	Ntekereza ko ari we muntu wa hafi kuri njye.
It was not possible.	Ntabwo byari bishoboka.
I can't figure out the problem.	Sinshobora kumenya ikibazo.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
It was not a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi neza ko ari byo.
For one thing, you're going to take this.	Ikintu kimwe, ugiye gufata ibi.
I can't today.	Sinshobora uyu munsi.
I didn't know what it was.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo.
He said he looked good.	Yavuze ko yasaga neza.
Beyond reason	Kurenza ubwenge.
And well, at least.	Kandi nziza, kuri.
But especially nowadays.	Ariko cyane cyane muri iki gihe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
I never felt my age.	Sinigeze numva imyaka yanjye.
Father, however, does not want it to be done.	Se ariko, ntashaka ko abikora.
I had no reason not to do so.	Nta mpamvu nari mfite yo kutabikora.
But it's all my fault.	Ariko byose ni amakosa yanjye.
This was his man.	Uyu yari umuntu we.
Who would be.	Ninde wari kuba.
It is my family.	Ni umuryango wanjye.
It was simple and easy.	Byari byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
But, my phone.	Ariko, terefone yanjye.
It was all a good thing.	Byose byari ibintu byiza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kurya neza.
He is going to be in everything.	Agiye kuba muri byose.
That's all there is to it.	Ibyo aribyo byose mubyukuri.
You can't see anything.	Ntushobora kubona na kimwe.
He is not a stranger.	Ntabwo ari umuntu atazi.
They both knew the truth.	Bombi bari bazi ukuri.
Happy job.	Akazi yishimiye.
This is it now.	Ubu ni ubu.
If you are.	Niba uri.
You have very good hair.	Ufite umusatsi mwiza cyane.
I have to go wrong.	Ngomba kugenda nabi.
You really want to.	Mubyukuri urashaka.
Not good enough for my needs.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije kubyo nkeneye.
I think he was.	Ntekereza ko yari arimo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
She looked so beautiful.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza cyane.
And he is right.	Kandi afite ukuri.
All you can do is be yourself.	Ibyo ushobora kuba byose niwowe.
These were.	Aba bari.
You are not sure of that.	Ntabwo uzi neza ibyo.
He had nothing to say.	Ntiyari afite icyo avuga.
He only looked at her once.	Yarebye rimwe gusa hejuru ye.
The girl was mentally retarded.	Umukobwa nta ubwenge yari afite.
Every day was the same.	Buri munsi wari umwe.
What he did.	Ibyo yakoze.
Everything is great.	Byose ni byiza cyane.
In fact, it's really good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
But that is probably not the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari byo.
Today, you are the only one.	Uyu munsi, niwowe wenyine.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
I can't look up.	Sinshobora kureba hejuru.
You can try.	Urashobora kugerageza.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
I really didn't think so.	Ntabwo rwose natekerezaga ikindi.
And it probably didn't matter.	Kandi birashoboka ko ntacyo yari cyo.
What should we do? 	Tugomba gukora iki?
We are not very high.	Ntabwo turi hejuru cyane.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
We are in it.	Turi muri yo.
You are not sure of the problem.	Ntabwo uzi neza ikibazo.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
And he was young.	Kandi yari akiri muto.
I don’t know how that is possible.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo ibyo bishoboka.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi.
You have no plans.	Nta gahunda ufite.
Walking would have been difficult.	Kugenda byari kuba bigoye.
Apparently he was his master.	Biragaragara ko yari umuhanga we.
Please, he was gone.	Nyamuneka, yari yagiye.
so far.	kugeza ubu.
And it went wrong.	Kandi byagenze nabi.
Up.	Hejuru.
Or maybe it's not.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byo.
He made many friends in his time.	Yabonye inshuti nyinshi mugihe cye.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
This world, this world of mine.	Iyi si, iyi si yanjye.
This is a good thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.

I’m doing a lot of good.	Ndimo gukora byinshi byiza.
It was something.	Yari ikintu.
I want to think more.	Ndashaka gutekereza cyane.
I really need to work on that.	Nkwiye rwose gukora kuri ibyo.
No one did it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
He came close.	Yaje hafi.
I'm sorry.	Mbabajwe na.
He did very well.	Yakoze neza cyane.
I think it would be great.	Ntekereza ko byari kuba byiza.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira uko byagenze.
You have to stay away from me.	Ugomba kuguma kure yanjye.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
I am thirty years old.	Mfite imyaka mirongo itatu.
Does anyone know anything?	Hari umuntu uzi ikintu?
I love people here.	Nkunda abantu hano.
But you don’t have to stay if you don’t want to.	Ariko ntugomba kuguma niba udashaka.
No one wanted to talk.	Nta muntu n'umwe yashakaga kuvugana.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
I wanted to leave.	Nashakaga kuva aho.
The player never wanted to.	Umukinnyi ntabwo yigeze ashaka.
Who owns this house?	Ninde ufite iyi nzu?
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ariko ibyo ni amahirwe gusa.
Many good friends.	Inshuti nyinshi nziza.
She was a beautiful woman.	Yari umugore mwiza.
Carrying clothes, the same.	Gutwara imyenda, kimwe.
You are human.	Uri umuntu.
I really feel good about being in this world again.	Mubyukuri numva ari byiza kongera kuba muri iyi si.
Working is good.	Gukora ni byiza.
I love all that.	Nkunda ibyo byose.
He loved that.	Yakundaga ibyo.
He is not in this world.	Ntabwo ari muri iyi si.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
It’s a good thing to do.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
But we have to go very far.	Ariko tugomba kujya kure cyane.
It's good to be back.	Nibyiza gusubira.
He did not know what he meant.	Ntiyari azi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
At that point it would be gone.	Icyo gihe byari kugenda.
I don't want to be friends with you!	Sinshaka kuba inshuti nawe!
I am your son.	Ndi umuhungu wawe.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
Father, one.	Se, umwe.
Away.	Kure.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
I think that's the last thing we need.	Ntekereza ko aricyo kintu cya nyuma dukeneye.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
There was not much he could do until then.	Nta kintu kinini yashoboraga gukora kugeza icyo gihe.
Things here are a little tricky.	Ibintu hano ni ikibazo gito.
Anyone with this problem.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese afite iki kibazo.
He lives nearby.	Aba hafi ya hano.
He tried to retreat.	Yagerageje gusubira inyuma.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And they had a party.	Kandi bari bafite ibirori.
There is one problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo kimwe.
He had a daughter.	Yari afite umukobwa.
Not everything is good.	Ntabwo byose ari byiza.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
I can’t do everything today or even this week.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora byose uyumunsi cyangwa no muri iki cyumweru.
Can you have a good party?	Urashobora gukora ibirori neza?
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kuri uyu munsi.
What he said is true.	Ibyo yavuze ni ukuri.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
Cuba.	Kuba.
I'm not sure if there is anything else.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko hari ikindi kintu.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
We have to think first.	Tugomba gutekereza mbere.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
And on top.	Kandi hejuru.
No one is around you.	Nta n'umwe uri hafi yawe.
And you have.	Kandi ufite.
But he was here.	Ariko yari hano.
Not good so far.	Ntabwo ari byiza kugeza ubu.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekereje.
If there is no good, there is no evil.	Niba nta cyiza, nta kibi.
I should have stayed with him.	Nari nkwiye kuguma hamwe na we.
He would not understand.	Ntabwo yari kumva.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
I had an idea.	Nari mfite igitekerezo.
Together, we can do this.	Twese hamwe, dushobora gukora ibi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibi rwose nibyo byoroshye.
No one knew what to do.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo gukora.
It seems very difficult.	Birasa nkaho bigoye cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He has a job.	Afite akazi.
For everything.	Kuri buri kintu.
And that is not true.	Ibyo kandi ntabwo ari ukuri.
And for us.	Kandi kuri twe.
He can also speak.	Arashobora kandi kuvuga.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane.
They probably had the truth.	Birashoboka ko bari bafite ukuri.
She wanted to see her friend.	Yashakaga kubona inshuti ye.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
And a little.	Kandi gito.
We have to take time.	Tugomba gufata umwanya.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we yari afite ubwoba.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
It's not the same thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva byoroshye kugenda.
Only one can help.	Umwe gusa arashobora gufasha.
Things were very difficult.	Ibintu byari bigoye cyane.
Maybe he knows something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo yaba azi.
This is not your baby.	Uyu ntabwo ari umwana wawe.
That's it.	Uwo ni.
I think they were far enough away.	Ndatekereza ko bari kure bihagije.
Now he was scared.	Ubu yari afite ubwoba.
Most of the time no problem.	Igihe kinini nta kibazo.
Wisdom, meditation and meditation.	Ubwenge, gutekereza no gutekereza.
You too.	Nawe.
I could not buy what he said.	Sinigeze nshobora kugura ibyo yavuze.
But he had to.	Ariko yagombaga.
You do the same thing.	Ukora ikintu kimwe.
I know he doesn't want a family.	Nzi ko adashaka umuryango.
It will be good for everyone.	Bizaba byiza kuri bose.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
I have things to do.	Mfite ibintu byo gukora.
They knew what my son was doing.	Bari bazi icyo umuhungu wanjye akora.
Here he had everything he needed.	Hano yari afite ibyo yari akeneye byose.
Here we are.	Ni hano.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora byose.
It is not very good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza cyane.
And he knew it was me.	Kandi yari azi ko ari njye.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
It's up to him.	Ari kuri we.
I am looking for my daughter.	Ndashaka umukobwa wanjye.
I did something you didn't want to do.	Nakoze ikintu udashaka.
If so then.	Niba icyo gihe na.
He wants a family.	Ashaka umuryango.
She felt embarrassed.	Yumvise afite isoni.
A woman can't walk.	Umugore ntashobora kugenda.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Who has it ?.	Ninde ufite?.
I just knew.	Nari nzi gusa.
Or not.	Cyangwa sibyo.
Let the children.	Reka abana.
He knew he couldn't win.	Yari azi ko adashobora gutsinda.
He just knew it was there.	Yari azi gusa ko ahari.
You are doing things.	Urimo gukora ibintu.
Most people would do this, not just one.	Abantu benshi bari gukora ibi, ntabwo ari umwe gusa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
Today was a good day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atabikoze.
Too many are possible.	Benshi cyane birashoboka.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He had everything he wanted.	Yari afite ibyo yashakaga byose.
I had.	Nari mfite.
He was not ready to do that.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye kubikora.
He is not young.	Ntabwo akiri muto.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
Kandi.	Kandi.
You don’t know exactly the inside.	Ntabwo uzi neza imbere.
We have to go home.	Tugomba gutaha.
Things were going well.	Ibintu byari byiza.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
It's early in the morning.	Hari mu gitondo cya kare.
I heard a lot.	Numvise byinshi.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
I don't think he was.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko yari.
I want her to feel the same way.	Ndashaka ko na we yumva.
No one is here.	Nta muntu uri hano.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
That’s not the only thing here.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa hano.
But it seems.	Ariko birasa.
You have to help.	Ugomba gufasha.
I was there too.	Nanjye nari icyo gihe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Friends, it's easy to get caught.	Inshuti, byoroshye kubona gufata.
You know it's true.	Uzi ko ari ukuri.
You can go back.	Urashobora gusubira inyuma.
There is fear.	Hariho ubwoba.
You have to believe.	Ugomba kwizera.
But he knew what to do.	Ariko yari azi icyo gukora.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
He had enough of that.	Yari afite ibyo bihagije.
But he is not.	Ariko we sibyo.
He took his place.	Yafashe umwanya we.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
He must see and hear.	Agomba kubona no kumva.
You don't like it	Ntabwo ukunda.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You don't know exactly what happened.	Ntabwo uzi neza uko byagenze.
I didn't know what he was doing.	Sinari nzi icyo arimo gukora.
I did not know.	Sinari nzi.
Definitely a dog.	Rwose imbwa.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He will never hear.	Ntazigera yumva.
I don't need that this morning.	Ntabwo nkeneye ibyo muri iki gitondo.
And for some as a baby gets older, he or she will outgrow this.	Na we, yatangiye gato.
I don’t want to say it’s hard.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga ko bigoye.
Good friends	Inshuti nziza.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
I'm glad I'm worried.	Nishimiye impungenge.
This was good for both of them.	Ibi byari byiza kuri bombi.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
Like him.	Kimwe na we.
This is the family here.	Uyu ni umuryango hano.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
He loves his father.	Akunda se.
We have to do something.	Tugomba gukora ikintu.
You don't have to do anything.	Ntugomba kugira icyo ukora.
I know my hair.	Nzi umusatsi wanjye.
I have to go quickly.	Ngomba kugenda vuba.
The car started moving.	Imodoka yatangiye kugenda.
He is not my friend.	Ntabwo ari inshuti yanjye.
But he wanted to know more.	Ariko yashakaga kumenya byinshi.
I can't take this.	Sinshobora gufata ibi.
He knows why.	Azi impamvu.
I understand what you are up to.	Ndumva ibyo urimo.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
There is no one involved.	Nta n'umwe urimo.
This is probably normal.	Ibi birashoboka ko ari ibintu bisanzwe.
What did he say?	Yavuze iki?
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
There is not much you can do.	Nta byinshi ushobora gukora.
The child was the only child.	Umwana yari umwana wenyine.
And that will be enough.	Kandi ibyo bizaba bihagije.
And it's good to see.	Kandi ni byiza kureba.
It was not a small thing for me.	Ntabwo byari kuri njye ikintu gito.
Really good guy.	Mubyukuri umusore mwiza.
He didn't want anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga.
He says he is a friend.	Avuga ko ari inshuti.
He did not see the possibility.	Ntabwo yabonye uko bishoboka.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
People are scared.	Abantu bafite ubwoba.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I have to help.	Ngomba gufasha.
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
He said something.	Yavuze ikintu.
Here.	Hano.
You are very close.	Uri hafi cyane.
It will not be enough.	Ntabwo bizaba bihagije.
While this is true, it is clearly a mistake.	Mugihe ibi ari ukuri, biragaragara ko ari amakosa.
All in good time.	Byose mugihe cyiza.
It was not what he expected.	Ntabwo byari ibyo yari yiteze.
I want to know more.	Ndashaka kumenya neza.
Kandi.	Kandi.
That would be normal.	Ibyo byaba ari ibintu bisanzwe.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
On that day.	Kuri uwo munsi.
Knowing he has to.	Kumenya ko agomba.
There is	Hariho
There are good things here.	Hano hari ibintu byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I really can't wait for that day.	Ntabwo rwose nshobora gutegereza uwo munsi.
Bad times.	Igihe kibi.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo iki kibazo.
If you want.	Niba ushaka.
Maybe it was something else.	Ahari byari ikindi kintu cyose.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
You can try.	Urashobora kugerageza.
He had to say something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo avuga.
He found it difficult to eat.	Yabonye ko bigoye kurya.
I guess he knew where to look.	Ndakeka ko yari azi aho agomba kureba.
But there is a catch.	Ariko hariho gufata.
In all things.	Muri byose.
I have to stop.	Ngomba guhagarika.
I like that question.	Nkunda icyo kibazo.
I did.	Nakoze.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
He wanted to hear more about it, especially.	Yashakaga kumva byinshi muri byo, cyane.
He or she.	Ni we cyangwa twe.
Living with his father.	Kubana na se.
Above, one can have a bad idea.	Hejuru, umuntu ashobora kugira igitekerezo kibi.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikibazo kinini.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
Sometimes a day.	Rimwe na rimwe munsi.
He clearly feels bad about this.	Biragaragara ko yumva nabi kuri ibi.
Probably, very likely.	Birashoboka, birashoboka cyane.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I don't have to drive.	Ntabwo ngomba gutwara.
This is him.	Uyu niwe.
There is a truth to this.	Hariho ukuri kuri ibi.
Eventually, he came down.	Amaherezo, yaje hasi.
That was close.	Ibyo byari hafi.
Or for him.	Cyangwa kuri we.
I know everything about him.	Nzi byose kuri we.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
I was going to say the same thing.	Nari ngiye kuvuga ikintu kimwe.
You have to	Ugomba
I didn't know what it was.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo.
I don’t want him to look like her.	Ntashaka ko asa na we.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ni muto cyane kuri njye.
I really have a job to do.	Mfite rwose akazi ko gukora.
I thought it was a good idea.	Natekereje ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I want to go outside.	Ndashaka hanze.
More, more in me.	Byinshi, byinshi muri njye.
He was not sure what had happened.	Ntabwo yari azi neza uko byagenze.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I knew this and it was not very good.	Nari nzi ibi kandi ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
I feel like a child.	Numva ndi umwana.
You are very young.	Uri muto cyane.
It's not easy !.	Ntabwo byoroshye!.
He had a lot of problems.	Yari afite ibibazo byinshi.
But I can't.	Ariko ntashobora.
We have to work now.	Tugomba gukora ubu.
He has to act fast.	Agomba gukora vuba.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
It's a short time.	Ni igihe gito.
None of us did.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wabikoze.
Can you do anything about it?	Hari icyo ushobora gukora kuri ibyo?
Maybe this would be great.	Ahari ibi byaba ari byiza.
That wasn't true, but it would be enough.	Ntabwo byari ukuri rwose, ariko byari kuba bihagije.
There is one problem, though.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe, naho.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
You can tell.	Urashobora kuvuga.
That's what he wanted.	Ibyo ni byo yashakaga.
I have money.	Mfite amafaranga.
I can't swim.	Sinshobora koga.
I never wanted children.	Sinigeze nshaka abana.
You can't do it alone.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine.
I don't want his money.	Sinshaka amafaranga ye.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
He is very professional.	Ni umuhanga cyane.
He also said.	Yavuze kandi.
I want the same thing.	Ndashaka ikintu kimwe.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
Well, you can go.	Nibyiza, urashobora kugenda.
It’s something to see.	Ni ikintu cyo kubona.
He took the book.	Yafashe igitabo.
I know who he is.	Nzi uwo ari we.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
I got the idea.	Nabonye igitekerezo.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It was not us.	Ntabwo yari twe.
I saw nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe nabonye.
He does not always do so.	Ntabwo abikora buri gihe.
In this room.	Muri iki cyumba.
And after all.	Kandi nyuma ya byose.
But that's not good enough.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
Not to mention.	Nta kuvuga.
I want to read soon.	Ndashaka gusoma vuba.
If you want to do that, fine.	Niba ushaka gukora ibyo, nibyiza.
He had time to do it.	Yari afite umwanya wo kubikora.
He was alone in the house with her.	Yari wenyine mu nzu hamwe na we.
I knew.	Nari nzi.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Outside.	Hanze.
He went to her.	Yagiye kuri we.
Want to read more ???.	Ushaka gusoma byinshi ???.
But he had friends.	Ariko yari afite inshuti.
Everyone is so beautiful and so beautiful.	Umuntu wese ni mwiza rwose kandi ni mwiza rwose.
He can do it.	Ashobora kubikora.
He gave it to his father.	Yahaye se.
He thinks he shouldn't come.	Yibwira ko atari akwiye kuza.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
But he wants to.	Ariko arashaka.
I did a lot.	Nakoze cyane.
I thought he might be her.	Natekereje ko ashobora kuba ari we.
You need to know what it is.	Ugomba kumenya icyo aricyo.
Beautiful house.	Inzu nziza.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Now he had his problem.	Ubu yari afite ikibazo cye.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
I shouldn’t have been driving here.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gutwara imodoka hano.
He can't do anything.	Ntashobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
Taking a car.	Gufata imodoka.
He did not know where.	Ntabwo yari azi aho.
It's a great swim.	Ni koga cyane.
But it is also possible.	Ariko birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
I really need to talk to you.	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana nawe.
And we are here to stay.	Kandi turi hano kuguma.
He wanted to wait.	Yashakaga gutegereza.
We can't take this.	Ntidushobora gufata ibi.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
I know what you want.	Nzi icyo ushaka.
How.	Uburyo.
This is absolutely true.	Ibi rwose ni ukuri.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Quit.	Kureka.
You can't leave a good friend.	Ntushobora kureka inshuti nziza.
I am that person.	Ndi uwo muntu.
Eventually, he would leave.	Amaherezo, yari kugenda.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Niba atari uyu munsi, ejo, vuba.
Everyone knows everyone.	Buri wese azi abantu bose.
The house is not far from here.	Iyo nzu ntabwo iri kure aha.
He is here with us.	Ari hano hamwe natwe.
There is fear.	Hariho ubwoba.
At one point there were problems.	Igihe kimwe hariho ibibazo.
Nice to meet you.	Nishimiye kuvugana nawe.
You can stay.	Urashobora kuguma.
I am very happy with this.	Nishimiye cyane ibi.
He had a job to do before dawn.	Yari afite akazi akora mbere yuko bwira.
So far, nothing.	Kugeza ubu, ntacyo.
It was not normal now.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe ubu.
It was not today.	Ntabwo byari uyu munsi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I can't go back.	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma.
He must know for sure.	Agomba kumenya neza.
But he thought that would be the case.	Ariko yibwiraga ko ibyo byari kugenda.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, sibyo.
He is.	Niwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He should be too.	Na we agomba kuba.
The house is nice and nice.	Inzu ni nziza kandi nziza.
He is human and he is human.	Ni umuntu kandi ni umuntu.
That was a little difficult.	Ibyo byari bigoye gato.
And he had a friend.	Kandi yari afite inshuti.
He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kugenda.
To see	Kubona.
But it would be better if I went.	Ariko byaba byiza ngiye.
But we can't do that.	Ariko ntidushobora kugira ibyo.
I was going to say this.	Nari ngiye kuvuga ibi.
He took a seat in front of me.	Yafashe umwanya imbere yanjye.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Well, you can always try.	Nibyiza, urashobora buri gihe kugerageza.
Too much experimentation.	Kugerageza byinshi.
This is true.	Iki ni ukuri.
I'm worried.	Mfite impungenge.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
Swim up.	Koga hejuru.
You don't have to go early.	Ntugomba kugenda kare.
There is a house here	Hano hari inzu
I am happy for my family.	Nishimiye umuryango wanjye.
And that was it.	Kandi ibyo byari byo.
He had enough of that.	Yari afite ibyo bihagije.
He did not do everything right.	Ntabwo yakoze byose neza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Everyone wanted to talk one last time.	Umuntu wese yashakaga kuvugana bwa nyuma.
He is.	Niwe.
He knew he loved his father.	Yari azi ko akunda se.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
He felt it was a long time.	Yumvise ko byari igihe kirekire.
For everyone, I am too.	Kuri buri wese, nanjye ndimo.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe.
You know what it is.	Uzi icyo aricyo.
I’m not sure if any of that.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko hari kimwe muri ibyo.
I was not sure at the time.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza icyo gihe.
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
What did he think?	Yatekereje iki?
I need to work on more.	Nkeneye gukora kuri byinshi.
That's good enough for me.	Nibyiza bihagije kuri njye.
Going to.	Kujya kuri.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ni ko byagenze.
It is not difficult but it is not easy.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
It would be nice to have my day.	Byaba byiza umunsi wanjye.
He had to do it.	Yagombaga kubikora.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
But that was good for me.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza kuri njye.
I can't wait.	Ntashobora gutegereza.
There seems to be time for me here.	Nkaho hari umwanya kuri njye hano.
One cannot go back.	Umuntu ntashobora gusubira inyuma.
And it was about time.	Kandi byari hafi igihe.
We have all day.	Dufite umunsi wose.
We had nothing to do with it.	Ntacyo twari dufite cyo kubikora.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
You are not sure about that.	Ntabwo uzi neza kuri ibyo.
Well, at least you didn't go down without explaining yourself first.	Nibyiza, ufite igihe gito.
He was a very good player.	Yari umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
I really don't know.	Ntacyo nzi mubyukuri.
But we are just good friends.	Ariko turi inshuti nziza gusa.
Behind.	Inyuma.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
At that time I did not know.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi.
He began to retreat.	Yatangiye gusubira inyuma.
He needs to know more.	Agomba kumenya byinshi.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
And really, really good.	Kandi mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He could see nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
It's too early.	Ni kare cyane.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I know that's not true.	Nzi ko atari byo.
He agreed to talk to me.	Yemeye kuvugana nanjye.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
He just thought it was.	Yatekereje gusa ko ari.
We don't even have to stay.	Ntabwo tugomba no kuguma.
They have one daughter.	Bafite umukobwa umwe.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
You probably did.	Birashoboka ko wabikoze.
You can't help everyone.	Ntushobora gufasha abantu bose.
He could go at any time.	Yashoboraga kugenda igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
He sits for everyone.	Yicaye kuri bose.
I like a lot of things.	Nkunda ibintu byinshi.
You need to look up.	Ukeneye kureba hejuru.
Almost the same as going home.	Hafi kimwe no gusubira murugo.
He didn't seem to mind.	Ntabwo yasaga nkaho yibwiraga ko ari byiza.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
But it was easy.	Ariko byari byoroshye.
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.
This was true.	Ibi byari mubyukuri.
Sometimes, you have to work on it.	Rimwe na rimwe, ugomba gukora kuri yo.
I can walk.	Nshobora kugenda.
He found a good wife.	Yabonye umugore mwiza.
You can take a car.	Urashobora gufata imodoka.
Clearly, what he said was not true.	Biragaragara ko ibyo yavuze atari ukuri.
Work is work, and money is money.	Akazi ni akazi, kandi amafaranga ni amafaranga.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
In.	Muri.
It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari.
Maybe he didn't have time to go.	Birashoboka ko atari afite umwanya wo kugenda.
You need to do it.	Ukeneye kubikora.
It would be so easy.	Byaba byoroshye cyane.
He has nothing.	Nta na kimwe afite.
He didn't have much time to do it.	Ntabwo yari afite igihe kinini cyo kubikora.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I don't want him to be me.	Sinshaka ko ari njye.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
Anything to win.	Ikintu cyose cyo gutsinda.
Or on.	Cyangwa kuri.
He wanted to try something else.	Yashakaga kugerageza ikindi kintu.
For something.	Ku kintu.
He loved a lot about her.	Yakundaga byinshi kuri we.
But something to look forward to.	Ariko ikintu cyo gutegereza.
But he didn't want to hear it.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kumva.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
I like tennis.	Akunda tennis.
Far, but not far.	Kure, ariko ntabwo ari kure.
I am very tall.	Ndi hejuru cyane.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
There is so much to see.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona.
A girl can.	Umukobwa arashobora.
I heard this.	Numvise ibi.
Good book.	Igitabo cyiza.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I can't find a way to do that.	Sinshobora kubona uburyo bwo kubikora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He came later.	Yaje nyuma.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I know how to do it.	Nzi kubikora.
But that is probably not the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari byo.
Na se.	Na se.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikibazo kinini.
Very nice girl	Umukobwa mwiza cyane.
The house was beautiful.	Inzu yari nziza.
Please, please.	Nyamuneka, nyamuneka.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I think he's gone.	Ntekereza ko yagiye.
Good gift !.	Impano nziza!.
He was a very good man of his time.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane wo mu gihe cye.
He's out here enough.	Ari hanze hano bihagije.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo sibyo rwose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I was not close.	Sinari hafi.
But that was not his.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo yari we.
But I don’t know how to do it.	Ariko sinzi uburyo bwo gukora.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I didn't know what to think.	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza.
He had the opportunity to live.	Yagize amahirwe yo kubaho.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
Everything you have, you have.	Ibyo ufite byose, ufite.
I don't want this.	Sinshaka ibi.
You can see anything.	Urashobora kubona ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
But I don't know what it is.	Ariko ntazi icyo aricyo.
He never did much.	Ntiyigeze akora ikintu kinini.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
He is playing tennis.	Arimo gukina tennis.
Nothing, and never.	Nta na kimwe, kandi nta na rimwe.
But inside he was.	Ariko imbere yari.
You think you know what you want.	Utekereza ko uzi icyo ushaka.
Do you want to help with meals?	Urashaka gufasha mugihe cyo kurya?
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
That is in the morning.	Ibyo ni mu gitondo.
I knew nothing.	Ntacyo nari nzi.
And, he would have nothing to see tonight.	Kandi, nta na kimwe yari kubona muri iri joro.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And that's not enough.	Kandi ntabwo bihagije.
In the house	Mu nzu.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu cyo kuvuga.
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
He doesn't need to.	Ntabwo akeneye.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga cyane.
That will not be easy.	Ibyo ntabwo bizaba byoroshye.
He saw things.	Yabonye ibintu.
It wasn’t much to say.	Ntabwo byari byinshi byo kuvuga.
You can do this without any problems.	Ibi urashobora kubikora nta kibazo.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
I did wrong.	Nakoze nabi.
He must.	Agomba.
And you are.	Kandi uri.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko.
but in reality, it was a good day.	ariko mubyukuri, wari umunsi mwiza.
But he had come.	Ariko yari yaje.
I mean, it was just good.	Ndashaka kuvuga, byari byiza gusa.
His daughter looks very much like him.	Umukobwa we asa cyane na we.
He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kugenda.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
I thought about that for a long time.	Natekereje kuri ibyo igihe kirekire.
That's a good time.	Icyo gihe cyiza.
It was a great gift.	Byari impano nziza.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
If not me.	Niba atari njye.
But it is possible that this time around he would have had a chance.	Ariko birashoboka ko iki gihe yari kubona amahirwe.
He had children.	Yabonye abana.
He didn't want anything.	Nta na kimwe yashakaga.
He can make more money than me.	Arashobora kubona amafaranga menshi kundusha.
I think he was right.	Ntekereza ko yari afite ukuri.
He seemed young.	Yasaga naho ari muto.
But there.	Ariko aho.
He did it well.	Yabikoze neza.
I didn't think you were.	Sinatekerezaga ko uri.
And it is.	Kandi ni.
They know that.	Bazi ko aribyo.
Not just us.	Ntabwo ari twe gusa.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
This is not very good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
One can live that way.	Umuntu arashobora kubaho kubaho gutya.
But they are both scared.	Ariko bombi bafite ubwoba.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko nawe yari ahari.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
It's too early.	Hariho kare cyane.
He could do nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga gukora.
How we should live.	Uburyo tugomba kubaho.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
But he should have known better.	Ariko yari akwiye kumenya neza.
Recently.	Vuba aha.
It was time to do it.	Wari umwanya wo kubikora.
You have to be ashamed.	Ugomba kugira isoni.
But, sometimes.	Ariko, rimwe na rimwe.
None of us knew why.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari uzi impamvu.
He took the time.	Yafashe umwanya.
He didn't want his father at all.	Ntabwo yashakaga na gato se.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
My bad boy.	Umwana wanjye mubi.
This one he chose.	Uyu yahisemo.
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Igihe cyo gusubira mubyukuri.
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Your child inside.	Umwana wawe imbere.
The dog had to stay outside.	Imbwa yagombaga kuguma hanze.
He has a place.	Afite ibi.
I don't know anything else.	Sinzi ikindi.
And he was not worried.	Kandi ntiyari afite impungenge.
Sitting in front of him.	Yicaye imbere ye.
He was not alone, but he was alone.	Ntiyari wenyine, ariko yari wenyine.
He had to do it now.	Yagombaga kubikora ubu.
He is a young man who can 'work'.	Ni umusore 'arashobora gukora'.
I never liked it very much.	Sinigeze nkunda cyane.
One thing always.	Ikintu kimwe buri gihe.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo aribyo bose.
Until he does.	Kugeza atabikoze.
Maybe we have a talented guy in us.	Ahari dufite umusore ufite impano muri twe.
We were too.	Natwe twari.
This is true.	Ubu ni ukuri.
He is a young man.	Ni umusore.
Obviously for a while.	Biragaragara ko igihe gito.
It was not good.	Ntiyari nziza.
He does this all the time.	Ibyo abikora buri gihe.
And they were.	Kandi bari.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
Tell me, tell me.	Mbwira, mbwira.
This is normal.	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe.
It's good enough, and it will definitely be good enough.	Ni mwiza bihagije, kandi rwose azaba mwiza bihagije.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ahari.
To go	Kugenda.
I have this.	Mfite ibi.
He was a bad person.	Uwo yari umuntu mubi.
And nothing.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe.
But one has to look carefully.	Ariko umuntu agomba kureba neza.
But, one has to be whatever it is.	Ariko, umuntu agomba kuba icyo aricyo rwose.
He wanted more, more.	Yashakaga byinshi, byinshi.
He could see they had.	Yashoboraga kubona bafite.
I don't have to say.	Ntabwo ngomba kuvuga.
I think this is a good movie.	Ntekereza ko iyi ari firime nziza.
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
I think he wanted to.	Ntekereza ko yashakaga.
I think he was.	Ntekereza ko yari.
I was so scared.	Nagize ubwoba cyane.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
And he was probably right.	Kandi birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
Book, maybe.	Igitabo, ahari.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
But he was not.	Ariko ntabwo yari.
She was not his daughter.	Ntabwo yari umukobwa we.
He looked closely.	Yarebye cyane.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
At the time, he said everything was fine.	Icyo gihe yavuze ko ibintu byose byari byiza.
It's not far from here.	Ntabwo ari kure hano.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
It was a sight to behold.	Byari ibintu byo kubona.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	Kandi nta na kimwe kibi.
I don't want to go.	Ntashaka kugenda.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
It didn't happen that way.	Ntabwo byagenze gutya.
.	.
He should have gone.	Yari akwiye kugenda.
But that is not the problem.	Ariko icyo ntabwo ari ikibazo.
It was all normal.	Byose byari nkuko bisanzwe.
But as always, there is work to be done.	Ariko nkuko bisanzwe, hariho akazi ko gukora.
I don't want to say anything.	Sinshaka kugira icyo mbwira.
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
I was human.	Nari umuntu.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
However, where the problem is.	Ariko, aho ikibazo.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
I need to know that you can do it.	Nkeneye kumenya ko ushobora kubikora.
I was too.	Nanjye nari.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
There is no going back !.	Nta gusubira inyuma!.
But it all went awry.	Ariko byose byagenze nabi cyane.
Traveling the world.	Kugenda kuri iyi si.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Birashoboka ko ugomba kuguma murugo uyu munsi.
Space is short.	Umwanya ni muto.
Maybe he wants to talk.	Birashoboka ko ashaka kuvuga.
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
I don't have to be here at all.	Ntabwo ngomba kuba hano rwose.
I just had.	Nari mfite gusa.
There are about thirty cars here.	Hano hari imodoka nka mirongo itatu.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
What he had.	Icyo yari afite.
It's the same with children.	Ni ikintu kimwe kubana.
I wanted to hear something.	Nashakaga kumva ikintu.
It would be nice downstairs.	Byaba byiza hasi.
Maybe.	Yaba ahari.
Only I can do this.	Ninjye wenyine ushobora gukora ibi.
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora.
For me.	Kuri njye.
I made a mistake.	Nagize amakosa.
I saw it today.	Nabonye uyu munsi.
This movie is great for kids.	Iyi firime ni nziza kubana.
There are many of them.	Hariho byinshi muri byo.
He must have.	Agomba kugira.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
What did he say?	Yavuze iki?
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He sat there, thinking.	Yicaye aho, atekereza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
If he loves money.	Niba akunda amafaranga.
I don't think anyone did it.	Ntekereza ko nta muntu wabikoze.
He has to get out of here.	Agomba kuva hano.
I mean, good enough.	Ndashaka kuvuga, byiza bihagije.
He is about to do so.	Ari hafi kubikora.
He knew something, but he didn't know what it was.	Hari icyo yari azi, ariko ntabwo yari azi neza icyo aricyo.
She said her son was happy to be back at school.	Yavuze ko umuhungu we yishimiye gusubira ku ishuri.
He thought this was a good thing.	Yatekereje ko iki ari ikintu cyiza.
This was a working guy.	Uyu yari umusore ukora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You don't have time.	Ntabwo ufite umwanya.
Driving	Gutwara imodoka.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
But he didn't know he was gone.	Ariko ntiyari azi ko yagiye.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
We can't see a lot of people.	Ntidushobora kubona abantu benshi.
But he did not know why he had left.	Ariko ntiyari azi impamvu yagiye.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
But this was good for him.	Ariko ibi byari byiza kuri we.
Before you can have someone then.	Mbere yuko ushobora kugira umuntu icyo gihe.
I thought you were on me.	Natekereje ko uri kuri njye.
The book is very good.	Igitabo ni cyiza cyane.
He seemed to hear.	Yasaga naho yumva.
A woman is reading.	Umugore arimo gusoma.
The young man needed money.	Umusore yari akeneye amafaranga.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
I was in a meeting.	Nari mu nama.
I am a teacher.	Ndi umwarimu.
Think before you act.	Gutekereza mbere yuko akora.
But they are children.	Ariko ni abana.
Can you see	Urashobora kubona?
That was a really good thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza rwose.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
You were so close.	Wari hafi cyane.
You do a lot.	Ukora byinshi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He wanted both.	Yashakaga bombi.
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
There is nothing to do now.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gukora ubu.
And, play.	Kandi, gukina.
He got it wrong.	Yabonye nabi.
He went alone.	Yagiye wenyine.
But, in reality, it is not good.	Ariko, mubyukuri, ntabwo ari byiza.
I knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Nari nzi icyo kugerageza ikintu kinini.
Probably no one would have gone to jail.	Birashoboka ko nta muntu n'umwe wari kujya muri gereza.
He had many friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
I want to know what he said.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo yavuze.
We have to try.	Tugomba kugerageza.
He has a high opinion of him.	Afite igitekerezo cyo hejuru kuri we.
They were close to his age.	Bari hafi imyaka ye.
He used to drink a lot.	Yakundaga kunywa cyane.
But he knew more.	Ariko yari azi byinshi.
You too, man.	Nawe, muntu.
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo yari cyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Me too.	Nanjye.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
House is house.	Inzu ni inzu.
I needed to get out of the house.	Nari nkeneye kuva mu nzu.
I have a very good plan.	Mfite gahunda nziza cyane.
Anyone can do the job.	Umuntu wese arashobora gukora akazi.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
He lives nearby.	Aba hafi aha.
But there are problems.	Ariko hariho ibibazo.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
Women.	Akazi.
He didn’t have much plans.	Ntabwo yari afite gahunda nyinshi.
I want to know what that is.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
And that's exactly what I need.	Kandi ibyo nibyo nkeneye.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, ni byiza cyane.
This is you.	Uyu niwowe.
But there are good things to do.	Ariko hariho ibintu byiza byo gukora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko hano hari ikintu rwose.
He was very young.	Yari akiri muto cyane.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
He was gone now.	Yari yagiye ubu.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
I'm not sure what that is.	Sinzi neza ibyo aribyo.
But they were out.	Ariko bari hanze.
But things are real.	Ariko ibintu ni ukuri.
Not much he wants here.	Ntabwo ari byinshi ashaka hano.
He is not here now.	Ubu ntabwo ari hano.
Apparently you look good, you look good.	Biragaragara ko usa neza, usa neza.
You do everything now.	Ukora byose ubu.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
This is not the case today.	Ntabwo ari ukuri muri iki gihe.
Whatever he expected, it was not.	Ibyo yaba yiteze byose, ntabwo aribyo.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
He has a family.	Afite umuryango.
He wanted to do something.	Yashakaga kugira icyo akora.
However, this is not the case here.	Ariko, ntabwo aricyo kibazo hano.
I want to do the same.	Nanjye ndashaka kubikora.
I need to know everything.	Nkeneye kumenya byose.
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
Everything would be great.	Ibintu byose byari kuba byiza cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
You are very close now.	Ubu uri hafi cyane.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
It's really good.	Nibyiza cyane mubyukuri.
Nothing here for him.	Nta kintu na kimwe hano kuri we.
You always know where he is.	Buri gihe uzi aho ari.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byaba byiza.
Then we have problems.	Icyo gihe dufite ibibazo.
Play well.	Gukina neza.
Very close.	Hafi cyane.
They know nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe bazi.
Not here or here.	Ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
It was hard to walk.	Byari bigoye kugenda.
I wanted to win so badly.	Nashakaga gutsinda nabi cyane.
No one can walk.	Nta muntu ushobora kugenda.
We are good friends	Turi inshuti nziza.
Not to mention this.	Ibi nta kuvuga.
Why are you here	Kuki uri hano?
I thought it was great.	Natekereje ko byari byiza cyane.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
If not.	Niba atari byo.
I can't stay here.	Sinshobora kuguma hano.
He was on the ground at the time.	Icyo gihe yari hasi.
He knew it was time to do it.	Yari azi ko hari igihe cyo kubikora.
The child cannot.	Umwana ntashobora.
He has to be scared.	Agomba kugira ubwoba.
He wanted to do this, once.	Yashakaga gukora ibi, rimwe.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
I saw things.	Nabonye ibintu.
We are not afraid.	Ntabwo dufite ubwoba.
One was expecting.	Umwe yari yiteze.
He knew a lot.	Yari azi byinshi.
He had a father.	Yari afite se.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
He did it before, and he does.	Yabikoze mbere, kandi abikora.
But you have to go.	Ariko ugomba kugenda.
But good things.	Ariko ibintu byiza.
But things went well.	Ariko ibintu byagenze neza.
She was very young and beautiful.	Yari muto cyane kandi mwiza.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
It's good to read.	Nibyiza gusoma.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
All of that.	Ibyo byose.
He will be here.	Azaba hano.
Or maybe not at all.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byo rwose.
But you can do it.	Ariko urashobora kubikora.
Children like him.	Abana nka we.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I feel for him.	Ndumva kuri we.
I'm sorry for what he did.	Mbabajwe nibyo yakoze.
Or father.	Cyangwa se.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I can't.	Sinshobora.
We have to have one or the other.	Tugomba kugira kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
She was a woman, not a girl.	Yari umugore, ntabwo yari umukobwa.
We don't have it here.	Ntabwo dufite hano.
I think this is a good idea.	Ntekereza ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza.
He is walking a little.	Arimo kugenda gato.
I mean, in fact, it was.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri, byari.
The boy can't figure out when.	Umuhungu ntashobora kumenya igihe.
I thought.	Natekereje.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari ahari.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Same with me.	Kimwe nanjye.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
It was all about me.	Yari byose kuri njye.

He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
This was a gift.	Iyi yari impano.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
There is a new movie here.	Hano hari firime nshya.

And they are smart.	Kandi bafite ubwenge.
I mean, a little, well.	Ndashaka kuvuga, gato, neza.
Quit.	Kureka.
There was nothing wrong with him.	Ntacyo yari kuri we.
He had trouble walking.	Yari afite ikibazo cyo kugenda.
Everyone knew there was something to learn.	Abantu bose bari bazi ko hari ibintu byo kwiga.
They are good friends.	Ni inshuti nziza.
It was as if he had seen something.	Nkaho hari ikintu yabonye.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
A gift.	Impano.
This was very easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye cyane.
Who did it?	Ninde wabikoze?
Things were really good.	Ibintu byari byiza rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I have a lot of that.	Mfite byinshi muri byo.
I didn't want to know.	Sinifuzaga kumenya.
He had his whole family.	Yari afite umuryango we wose.
I didn't think so.	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo.
It's a good thing.	Ni ibintu byiza.
And he can be alone.	Kandi arashobora kuba wenyine.
He needs money.	Akeneye amafaranga.
If it's a party.	Niba ari ibirori.
Boy, girl, dog.	Umuhungu, umukobwa, imbwa.
Little did he know it was early in the morning.	Ntiyari azi ko hari mu gitondo cya kare.
Not very here, however.	Ntabwo ari hano cyane, ariko.
No catch.	Nta gufata.
There was one more thing he had to do first.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe yagombaga gukora mbere.
We have to.	Tugomba.
But we have to take my car.	Ariko tugomba gufata imodoka yanjye.
I'm afraid he has the truth.	Mfite ubwoba ko afite ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo yari gukora.
You have to stay home.	Ugomba kuguma murugo.
Want to see sooner or later?	Ushaka kubona vuba cyangwa ikindi.
Just look.	Kureba gusa.
He has to go now.	Agomba kugenda ubu.
It was close.	Byari hafi.
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
That was very easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye cyane.
In and out like that.	Muri no hanze gutya.
And he knows why.	Kandi azi impamvu.
Little boy, his hair.	Umuhungu muto, umusatsi we.
There is a slight wait.	Hariho gutegereza gato.
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
Little did he know that he could talk to you like that.	Ntabwo yari azi ko ashobora kuvugana nawe gutya.
Today he told me why.	Uyu munsi yambwiye impamvu.
I want to swim.	Ndashaka koga.
I am your wife now.	Ndi umugore wawe ubu.
Not before, and not now.	Ntabwo mbere, kandi si ubu.
Probably today.	Birashoboka uyu munsi.
He would not do what he does.	Ntabwo yari gukora ibyo akora.
I don’t have time to say much.	Ntabwo mfite umwanya wo kuvuga byinshi.
He did not know how.	Ntiyari azi uburyo.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, byari byiza mbere.
I know someone knows what I was looking for.	Nzi ko umuntu azi icyo nashakaga.
It was here before.	Byari hano mbere.
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
You have to be close.	Ugomba kuba uri hafi.
I need help.	Ngomba gushaka ubufasha.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ugomba kuva hano.
We were good friends this morning.	Twari inshuti nziza muri iki gitondo.
He thought well, and it was good.	Yatekerezaga neza, kandi byari byiza.
He has a lot.	Afite byinshi.
He needs to hear the truth.	Akeneye kumva ukuri.
It is my car.	Ni imodoka yanjye.
You can't stay here!	Ntushobora kuguma hano!
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
Money.	Amafaranga.
The child had to walk.	Umwana yagombaga kugenda.
No one knew where.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
He is a good man, a man.	Ni umuntu mwiza, muntu.
And one more thing.	Kandi ikindi kintu kimwe.
We have to go eat.	Tugomba kujya kurya.
I need money.	Nkeneye amafaranga.
He had a problem of his own.	Yari afite ikibazo wenyine.
Bombi.	Bombi.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
It’s not just money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga gusa.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
That’s not a very good thing.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ibintu byiza cyane.
I was in a small room.	Nari mu cyumba gito.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
This was a house.	Iyi yari inzu.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I can't stay.	Sinshobora kuguma.
I can do a lot.	Nshobora gukora byinshi.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
Stop talking!	Reka kuvuga!
He would not have taken the opportunity.	Ntabwo yari gufata amahirwe.
It was not his first choice.	Ntabwo yahisemo bwa mbere.
Anything.	Ikintu cyose.
I was never scared.	Sinigeze mbona ubwoba.
Everything he said was true.	Ibyo yavuze byose byari ukuri.
It was not a problem for me.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo kuri njye.
But what do you think ?.	Ariko utekereza iki?.
Simple is good.	Byoroshye ni byiza.
All for one.	Byose kuri umwe.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
I did really well.	Nakoze neza rwose.
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
You are a good young man.	Uri umusore mwiza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, mubyukuri.
But only one woman.	Ariko umugore umwe gusa.
Trying a lot of things.	Kugerageza ibintu byinshi.
You have to see the things he took.	Ugomba kubona ibintu yafashe.
He was here before.	Yari hano mbere.
He chose to cancel his breakfast.	Yahisemo guhagarika gahunda ye yo mu gitondo.
I saw this.	Nabonye ibi.
He had.	Yari afite.
We have this.	Dufite ibi.
Probably the worst case scenario.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kintu kibi cyane muri byose.
There is a person.	Hariho umuntu.
I can't get out of here.	Sinshobora kuva hano.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I can't even eat.	Sinshobora no kurya.
It’s not just an opportunity.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe gusa.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
Or us.	Cyangwa natwe.
He asked for money.	Yasabye amafaranga.
Anything you want to watch here.	Ikintu cyose ushaka kureba hano.
He chose to stay.	Yahisemo kuguma.
That's a good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
I can find something else to do.	Nshobora kubona ikindi kintu cyo gukora.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
It was simple enough.	Byari byoroshye bihagije.
But tonight he was not.	Ariko iri joro ntabwo yari.
Where did he go? 	Yagiye he?
These are difficult people.	Aba ni abantu bigoye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
They have time.	Bafite umwanya.
Maybe you are.	Birashoboka ko uri.
He wanted to be close.	Yashakaga kuba hafi.
You can always talk to me.	Urashobora buri gihe kuvugana nanjye.
We have to do something.	Tugomba gukora ikintu.
Or maybe it's not good.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byiza.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
I swim a lot.	Ndi koga cyane.
He is having a good time.	Arimo kubona umwanya mwiza.
You?	Wowe?
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga ibi mubyukuri.
And time.	Kandi igihe.
It was enough to go.	Byari bihagije kugenda.
He should have been there.	Yari akwiye kuba ahari.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's too low.	Ni hasi cyane.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
He’s playing a lot.	Arimo gukina cyane.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
I don't think you need help.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ushaka ubufasha.
At that time he asked many questions.	Icyo gihe yabajije ibibazo byinshi.
It just doesn't seem to work.	Ntashobora gusa nkaho.
One day everything will be fine.	Umunsi umwe ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo yari mwiza cyane.
It was not bad.	Ntiyari mubi.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
Just me	Ni njye gusa.
He chose to be	Yahisemo ko ari
She is glad she agreed.	Yishimiye ko yemeye.
And you are.	Kandi uri.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
I need time to look into this.	Nkeneye igihe cyo kureba muri ibi.
I really want to play.	Ndashaka rwose gukina.
It is very good for one.	Ni mwiza cyane kuri umwe.
You have to stop this.	Ugomba guhagarika ibi.
And you can tell me what happened.	Kandi urashobora kumbwira uko byagenze.
I hope you can live with us.	Nizere ko ushobora kubana natwe kubaho.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuza hano.
I hope it worked out.	Ndizera ko byagenze neza.
I mean, that's not true.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko atari byo.
One week a lot.	Rimwe mu cyumweru ni byinshi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
This is what we can do.	Ibi nibyo dushobora gukora.
If we have more, it would be better.	Niba dufite byinshi, byaba byiza.
Reason for being present.	Impamvu yo kuba ahari.
I knew better than to ask questions.	Nari nzi neza kuruta gushaka ibibazo.
I have a lot to do today.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora uyu munsi.
He really doesn't have to have anything else to drink.	Ntabwo rwose agomba kugira ikindi kintu cyo kunywa.
He could really play.	Yashoboraga gukina rwose.
It really is.	Nukuri biragaragara.
We are not young players.	Ntabwo turi umukinnyi muto.
He thought about his choice.	Yatekereje ku byo yahisemo.
Tomorrow, the first thing.	Ejo, ikintu cya mbere.
I think so badly.	Ndatekereza nabi cyane.
He wanted so much.	Yashakaga cyane.
I want to do more.	Ndashaka gukora ibintu byinshi.
He is, and he is not.	Ari, kandi sibyo.
He would do nothing here.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari gukora hano.
I want the truth.	Ndashaka ukuri.
That's a good thing to say.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza cyo kuvuga.
He chose to leave.	Yahisemo kugenda.
He and I.	We na njye.
Maybe later, not tonight, but tomorrow.	Ahari nyuma, ntabwo iri joro, ariko ejo.
He doesn’t really have to be here, he does this.	Ntabwo rwose agomba kuba hano, akora ibi.
Your wife was right.	Umugore wawe yari afite ukuri.
They knew why.	Bari bazi impamvu.
He did it easily.	Yakoze byoroshye.
I like being a girl.	Nkunda kuba umukobwa.
I'm working on that too.	Nanjye ndimo gukora kuri ibyo.
It seems simple but it is not.	Birasa naho byoroshye ariko sibyo.
One day, he came to where I was.	Umunsi umwe, yaje aho ndi.
The first day was very bad.	Umunsi wa mbere wari mubi cyane.
Not too low, not too high.	Ntabwo ari hasi cyane, ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
He saw.	Yabonye.
Now he wants to make a film.	Ubu arashaka gukora firime.
I don't know what happened.	Sinzi uko byagenze.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
You have a plan.	Ufite gahunda.
I don’t want to go without it.	Ntashaka kugenda adafite.
But they would see.	Ariko bari kubona.
I have a house.	Mfite inzu.
Someone did everything.	Umuntu yakoze ibintu byose.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He was not an outsider.	Ntiyari umuntu wo hanze.
It was not good.	Ntabwo yari mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
He chose to leave.	Yahisemo kugenda.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
But if you have to go, you have to.	Ariko niba ugomba kugenda, ugomba.
As high as possible.	Nka hejuru cyane.
However, this is not a good idea.	Ariko, iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
It would be nice to know the money.	Byaba byiza kumenya amafaranga.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga rwose.
That is very true.	Ibyo ni ukuri cyane.
It's only in the morning.	Hari mu gitondo gusa.
I had a hearing problem.	Nagize ikibazo cyo kumva.
If possible.	Niba bishoboka.
Stop giving up.	Reka kureka.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
It's not out !.	Ntabwo ari hanze!.
And, maybe.	Kandi ,, birashoboka.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
They would have known that this was not the case in the short term.	Bari kumenya ko atari ibi mugihe gito.
That's great !.	Nibyiza cyane!.
He knew he looked good.	Yari azi ko asa neza.
I don't have to work.	Ntabwo ngomba gukora.
Things were difficult.	Ibintu byari bigoye.
I have a problem with my schedule.	Mfite ikibazo muri gahunda yanjye.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
We are here.	Turi hano.
It's not enough to do something.	Ntabwo bihagije kugira icyo ukora.
Thinking about something is good.	Gutekereza ku kintu ni byiza.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
That's what you said.	Nibyo wavuze.
I have a favorite.	Mfite ibyo nkunda.
And not only that.	Kandi si ibi gusa.
I think it's me for me.	Ntekereza ko ari njye kuri njye.
Obviously that is not the case.	Biragaragara ko ibyo atari ukuri.
And you want to know why.	Kandi ushaka kumenya impamvu.
For me, it was great.	Kuri njye, byari byiza cyane.
I thought.	Natekereje.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko ntagomba.
Sometimes, nothing is good.	Rimwe na rimwe, nta kintu na kimwe ari ikintu cyiza.
This, obviously enough, is a good time.	Ibi, biragaragara ko bihagije, ni igihe cyiza.
That sounds bad!	Ibyo birasa nabi!
Take a good look.	Kureba neza.
He is not watching.	Ntacyo arimo kureba.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga neza.
The young man was nearby.	Umusore yari hafi.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
It was a party.	Byari ibirori.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
We are here now.	Ubu turi hano.
That is not true.	Uwo ntabwo ari ukuri.
He does things.	Akora ibintu.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
It's a good morning.	Hari mu gitondo cyiza.
What about you ?.	Wowe iki?.
He had to increase his workload.	Yagombaga kongera akazi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He wouldn't tell me much about her.	Ntabwo yari kumbwira byinshi kuri we.
I knew nothing about this.	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri ibi.
It is not true.	Ntabwo ari kuri.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
And I think he is right.	Kandi ndatekereza ko afite ukuri.
Later, i.	Nyuma, i.
This is a good idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo cyiza.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
He works all the time.	Akora buri gihe.
And let it be.	Reka kandi.
We have to go together, tonight.	Tugomba kugenda hamwe, iri joro.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
He has to do it.	Agomba kubikora.
We are just children.	Turi abana gusa.
Or, in fact, fear.	Cyangwa, mubyukuri, ubwoba.
But there is a good reason.	Ariko mubyukuri hariho impamvu nziza.
At all times, it was my fault to be so close.	Igihe cyose, byari amakosa yanjye kuba hafi cyane.
That's right.	Nukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We are in this room.	Turi muri iki cyumba.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
We have to look at that first and foremost.	Tugomba kureba kuri ibyo mbere na mbere.
I know this is a bad time.	Nzi ko iki ari igihe kibi.
But it was probably true.	Ariko birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
That we can go home.	Ko dushobora gutaha.
I had a problem too.	Ninjye yari afite ikibazo.
His father said he was doing well.	Se yavuze ko gukora neza.
It is not very easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
He wanted her to leave.	Yashakaga ko agenda.
She is glad she has.	Yishimiye ko afite.
I don't.	Ntabwo.
And I love it so much.	Kandi nkunda cyane.
He didn't need to comment.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kugira icyo avuga.
That's all.	Byose, nuko.
But he was not here.	Ariko ntabwo yari hano.
Not really a good idea.	Ntabwo rwose ari igitekerezo cyiza.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
It's a mistake.	Ni amakosa.
Wisdom.	Ubwenge.
One of us, now.	Umwe muri twe, ubu.
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He asked many questions.	Yabajije ibibazo byinshi.
It really was.	Byari ibintu rwose.
I was in school all the time.	Nari mwishuri igihe cyose.
He thought you had something to say.	Yatekereje ko hari icyo ushaka kuvuga.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You don't know how.	Ntabwo uzi uko.
That's right, beautiful girl.	Nibyo, umukobwa mwiza.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
He was not familiar with the plan.	Ntabwo yari azi neza gahunda.
I can't say enough good things.	Sinshobora kuvuga ibintu byiza bihagije.
He had a short time.	Yari afite igihe gito.
You didn't see it.	Ntabwo wabonye.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
There is.	Hariho.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
Another thing to try.	Ikindi kintu kimwe cyo kugerageza.
You're going to do this now.	Ugiye gukora ibi nonaha.
But it was difficult.	Ariko byari bigoye.
He likes this.	Akunda ibi.
I really like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo rwose.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
he said.	yavuze.
Or how things went.	Cyangwa uko ibintu byagenze.
No later.	Nta nyuma.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He thought it would wait.	Yatekereje ko byari gutegereza.
He wants what he can't have.	Ashaka ibyo adashobora kugira.
Or whatever.	Cyangwa ibyo aribyo byose.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
Coming or going later.	Kuza cyangwa kugenda nyuma.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
Were they right ?.	Bari bafite ukuri?.
I am a very good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza cyane.
But we can't do that.	Ariko ibi ntidushobora kubikora.
We have to try to understand what he thinks.	Tugomba kugerageza kumva icyo atekereza.
I don’t want my son to do what you do.	Sinshaka ko umuhungu wanjye akora ibyo ukora.
And he felt happy that he had done it.	Kandi yumvise yishimiye ko yabikoze.
Not only that, there is a lot of money.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa, hari amafaranga menshi.
In fact, this is exactly what her hair looks like.	Mubyukuri, ibi nibyo umusatsi we usa.
He may never feel that he is anyone.	Birashoboka ko adashobora na rimwe kumva ko ari umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
That's the way it is today.	Uyu munsi ni ko byagenze.
I knew he had done it once.	Nari nzi ko igihe kimwe yabikoze.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
Always	Buri gihe.
Like here.	Nka hano.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
It was nothing.	Ntabwo yari ikintu na kimwe.
He had to leave here.	Yagombaga kuva hano.
But that is not really the case.	Ariko ibyo mubyukuri, mubyukuri ntabwo bishoboka.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
We were in it now.	Twari muri yo ubu.
This is me!	Uyu ni njye!
Maybe you can think of something ?.	Ahari ushobora gutekereza ikintu?.
This one had.	Uyu yari afite.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
'	'
I can't see how he could have lived.	Sinshobora kubona uko yashoboraga kubaho.
I'm glad that.	Nishimiye ibyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You can play.	Urashobora gukina.
There are many here.	Hano hari benshi.
I know it's hard, but that's what we have to do.	Nzi ko bigoye, ariko nibyo tugomba gukora.
He didn't do much.	Ntabwo yakoze ibintu byinshi.
I have a lot to think about.	Mfite byinshi byo gutekereza.
You have to be good.	Ugomba kuba mwiza.
Getting help.	Kubona ubufasha.
There is so much to do here.	Hano hari byinshi byo gukora hano.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
They don't know what it is.	Ntabwo bazi icyo aricyo.
There is a reason.	Hariho impamvu.
Today he did something he never did before.	Uyu munsi yakoze ikintu atigeze akora mbere.
He is doing it.	Arimo kubikora.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo gito.
It's good money.	Nibyiza amafaranga.
Someone upstairs.	Umuntu uri hejuru.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
He can also win.	Ashobora no gutsinda.
It started now.	Yatangiye ubu.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
I'm out.	Ndi hanze.
I'm sorry, but there is a reason.	Mbabajwe nibyo, ariko hariho impamvu.
He was the one who said it before.	Niwe wavuze mbere.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
That was always a problem for him.	Buri gihe ibyo byari ikibazo kuri we.
Anything that someone has done you can do.	Ikintu icyo aricyo cyose umuntu yakoze nawe urashobora gukora.
We don’t have to wait for anyone.	Ntabwo tugomba gutegereza umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
I should go now.	Nkwiye kugenda ubu.
But that’s a good idea.	Ariko icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo aribyo.
You have to go to school every day.	Ugomba kujya mwishuri buri munsi.
He will be ready to go.	Azaba yiteguye kugenda.
No one said much.	Nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
He had not said enough.	Ntabwo yari yavuze bihagije.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
But this is not the day.	Ariko uyu si uwo munsi.
You have	Ufite.
It was if.	Byari niba.
But it is not here.	Ariko ntabwo iri hano.
I think he has.	Ntekereza ko afite.
As much as possible.	Nkuko bishoboka.
In a small room.	Mu cyumba gito.
But he didn't need to.	Ariko ntiyari akeneye.
This is a good time.	Iki ni igihe cyiza.
The child can't even speak right now.	Umwana ntashobora no kuvuga ubu.
Advice.	Inama.
Her son needs help.	Umuhungu we akeneye ubufasha.
You have to.	Ugomba.
I saw a movie.	Nabonye firime.
But that was not the case at all.	Ariko ntabwo byari amahirwe na gato.
Good for both.	Nibyiza kuri bombi.
I can't believe I saw this.	Sinshobora kwizera ko nabonye ibi.
If not now, when ?.	Niba atari nonaha, ryari?.
This is the only one.	Uyu niwe wenyine.
Nothing for me.	Ntacyo kuri njye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He will be out here.	Azaba ari hanze aha.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
He feels good.	Yumva neza.
I got the idea.	Nabonye igitekerezo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari amakosa.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
Probably one day.	Birashoboka ko umunsi umwe.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
You are making a mistake.	Urimo gukora amakosa.
I am a good friend	Ndi inshuti nziza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He was inside.	Yari imbere.
I don’t know if we can win.	Sinzi niba dushobora gutsinda.
We are in the same class at school.	Turi mu ishuri rimwe ku ishuri.
You have to get out of there.	Ugomba kuva aho.
And that's great.	Kandi nibyiza cyane.
Do what you want.	Gukora icyo ushaka.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
He is not in it.	Ntabwo ari muri we.
There is only one thing wrong.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa kibi.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
I need to be in you.	Nkeneye kuba muri wowe.
He was not.	Ntiyari.
And they have.	Kandi bafite.
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora gutya.
A big deal, really.	Ikintu kinini, mubyukuri.
He has many friends.	Afite inshuti nyinshi.
He did not know why.	Ntiyari azi impamvu.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nibyo.
I hope simple people are right.	Nizere ko abantu byoroshye bafite ukuri.
I don’t know how to walk normally.	Sinzi uburyo bwo kugenda bisanzwe.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
The girl was very young.	Umukobwa yari muto cyane.
Woman.	Umugore .
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's good to be beautiful.	Nibyiza kuba mwiza.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You.	Wowe.
But he is a wise child.	Ariko ni umwana uzi ubwenge.
I had a long time.	Nari igihe kinini.
One moment, please!	Umwanya umwe, nyamuneka!
I have a job ahead of me.	Mfite akazi imbere yanjye.
But at the time, he didn't think much of it.	Ariko icyo gihe ntabwo yari yatekereje neza.
He was a good boy, but a good one was not good enough.	Yari umwana mwiza, ariko mwiza ntabwo wari mwiza bihagije.
I was not in that world.	Ntabwo nari muri iyo si.
And you were alone.	Kandi wari wenyine.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
The problem is that you need to know how to do it.	Ikibazo nuko ukeneye kumenya kubikora.
Not really tonight.	Nukuri ntabwo ari iri joro.
I needed it today.	Nari nkeneye uyu munsi.
I saw what he could do.	Nabonye icyo ashobora gukora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It's really good my car.	Nibyiza rwose imodoka yanjye.
I did not tell my family.	Ntabwo nabwiye umuryango wanjye.
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza.
Sometimes it's good.	Rimwe na rimwe ni byiza.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
He had what he needed.	Yari afite ibyo yari akeneye.
I never liked this at all.	Sinigeze nkunda ibi na gato.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
You know it's true.	Uzi ko ari ukuri.
He started drinking a lot.	Yatangiye kunywa cyane.
There wasn’t much of it, but there was something.	Ntabwo byari byinshi muri byo, ariko hari ikintu.
He lives nearby.	Aba hafi hano.
I don’t think he can make a lot of money doing that.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ashobora kubona amafaranga menshi kubikora.
And, all of us.	Kandi, twese.
You probably did.	Birashoboka ko wabikoze.
No one should be here.	Nta muntu ugomba kuba hano.
He may have tried to help.	Birashoboka ko yagerageje gufasha.
He has no faith.	Nta kwizera afite.
He began to have trouble thinking clearly.	Yatangiye kugira ikibazo cyo gutekereza neza.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
He was not at school today.	Uyu munsi ntabwo yari ku ishuri.
And that was over.	Kandi ibyo byari hejuru.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
No one knew it was there.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi ko ahari.
I saw this.	Nabonye ibi.
I'm not going to look.	Ntabwo ngiye kureba.
This is my favorite.	Ibi nibyo nkunda.
Otherwise, we cannot live in this world.	Niba atari byo, ntidushobora kubaho muri iyi si.
No one did it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
He may be alone.	Ashobora kuba wenyine.
I used to be a boy.	Nigeze kuba umuhungu.
You can't go farther.	Ntushobora kujya kure kuruta hasi.
You'd better go now.	Byaba byiza ugiye ubu.
What a wonderful day!	Wari umunsi mwiza wo kubaho!
I didn't want to be here.	Sinifuzaga kuba hano.
I can't wait to play.	Sinshobora gutegereza gukina.
But he is not alone.	Ariko we si we wenyine.
But it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
You make a mistake.	Ukora amakosa.
It is not enough to live.	Ntabwo bihagije kubaho.
We.	Ni.
But he had started.	Ariko yari yatangiye.
He took the lead.	Yafashe imbere.
'	'
He may have been at the same time.	Ashobora kuba yari mugihe kimwe.
Boy	Umuhungu
He does nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza.
I'm sure he knows who he is.	Nzi neza ko azi uwo ari we.
It looks exactly right.	Birasa neza neza.
Stop reading.	Guhagarika gusoma.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
Everyone was there.	Umuntu wese uwo ari we wese yari ahari.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
He wants to do things.	Ashaka gukora ibintu.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
Everything is possible.	Byose birashoboka.
This one is gone.	Uyu yagiye.
And he could see nothing.	Kandi ntacyo yashoboraga kubona.
I hope it's not you.	Nizere ko atari wowe.
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
She is a young girl.	Ni umukobwa muto.
I really believe this is true.	Nizera rwose ko ibi ari ukuri.
I don't want this.	Sinshaka ibi.
I was thinking now.	Natekerezaga ubu.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Too much food.	Ibiryo byinshi cyane.
He looked inside.	Yarebye imbere.
He wanted to drink.	Yashakaga kunywa.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
All in all, inside.	Byose, imbere.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
That would be a problem.	Byari kuba ikibazo.
He didn't need to think much.	Ntabwo yari akeneye gutekereza cyane.
I don’t know, not really.	Sinzi, ntabwo mubyukuri.
We can't go back now.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
And when he is right, he is right.	Kandi iyo afite ukuri, aba afite ukuri.
He was not sure how to do it.	Ntabwo yari azi neza uko azabikora.
I have a problem today.	Mfite ikibazo muri iki gihe.
We have.	Dufite.
He knew he couldn't win.	Yari azi ko adashobora gutsinda.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo byose.
Good things.	Ibintu byiza.
You were not one.	Ntabwo wari umwe.
Not many people that day.	Ntabwo ari abantu benshi kuri uwo munsi.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
He did not know what to say.	Ntiyari azi ibyo yavuze.
It's in school.	Hari mu ishuri.
I mean people.	Ndashaka kuvuga abantu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And they knew when he would be there.	Kandi bari bazi igihe azaba ahari.
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
Pre-existence.	Kuba mbere yo kuba.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
Now he is doing well.	Ubu arimo akora neza.
I thought we were.	Natekereje ko turi.
He saw nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
He really works very low.	Rwose akora hasi cyane.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
But a great book!	Ariko igitabo cyiza cyane!
He needed to know that.	Yari akeneye kumenya icyo kintu.
That's not really the case.	Mugihe mubyukuri ibyo sibyo.
They are years old.	Bafite imyaka.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ariko kimwe.
And that, he thought, was what he wanted.	Kandi ibyo, yatekerezaga ko aribyo yashakaga.
He has a job.	Afite akazi.
I found a reason.	Nabonye impamvu.
The girl was right.	Umukobwa yari afite ukuri.
He wants to see a movie.	Ashaka kureba firime.
Everyone was upstairs.	Abantu bose bari hejuru.
But you are not here.	Ariko ntabwo uri hano.
They knew what to do.	Bari bazi icyo gukora.
Someone has to say something.	Umuntu agomba kugira icyo avuga.
Looking for something to drink?	Urashaka ikintu cyo kunywa?
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
I mean, all the time.	Ndashaka kuvuga, buri gihe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
He was looking for people.	Yashakaga abantu.
We must overcome fear.	Tugomba gutsinda ubwoba.
I know that is true.	Nzi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
He said it was difficult.	Yavuze ko bigoye.
This is not a person.	Uyu ntabwo ari umuntu.
It's good advice.	Ni inama nziza.
The girl really knew she was beautiful.	Nukuri umukobwa yari azi ko ari mwiza.
It always looks the same, but it doesn't.	Igihe cyose birasa naho, sibyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I'm glad he said that.	Nishimiye ko yavuze.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He didn't need to say anything else.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kugira ikindi avuga.
I knew how to do it.	Nari nzi kubikora.
Or just a movie.	Cyangwa firime gusa.
If anyone can do this.	Niba hari ushobora gukora ibi.
I think it's really good for everyone.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza rwose kuri buri wese.
She asked her son for money.	Yasabye umuhungu we amafaranga.
I don't believe in anything.	Ntabwo kwizera ikintu.
He knows a lot.	Azi ibintu byinshi.
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I need one.	Nkeneye umwe.
One was really nice.	Umwe yari mwiza rwose.
I got the money.	Nabonye amafaranga.
He was no longer at home.	Ntabwo yari akiri murugo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
His father was right.	Se yari afite ukuri.
He is.	Ni we.
It was good for us.	Byari byiza kuri twe.
I'm sure you know what it is.	Nzi neza ko uzi icyo aricyo.
He said there was no problem.	Yavuze ko nta kibazo.
To the phone.	Kuri terefone.
He was in each one.	Yari muri buri umwe.
I never saw anything wrong with me.	Ntabwo wigeze mbona amakosa kuri njye.
The little boy was embarrassed.	Umuhungu muto yari afite isoni.
It started.	Yatangiye.
I ask really.	Ndabaza mubyukuri mubyukuri.
He looked at his age.	Yarebye imyaka ye.
He tried to find something that he thought was good.	Yagerageje gushaka icyo yibwira ko ari cyiza.
I can never be her.	Sinshobora na rimwe kuba we.
At work.	Ku kazi.
Of course, they would do it now.	Nukuri, iki gihe bari kubikora.
I got the idea.	Nabonye igitekerezo.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo.
He got it right.	Yabonye neza rwose.
However, this is not easy.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
What do you think about this ?.	Uratekereza iki kuri ibi?.
But sometimes later.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe nyuma.
And you're right.	Kandi uri kuri.
I think he can do it.	Ndakeka ko ashobora kubikora.
Way to go.	Uburyo ku kintu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He has the opportunity to live.	Afite amahirwe yo kubaho.
He has a good family.	Afite umuryango mwiza.
I know the family.	Nzi umuryango.
She was probably there to arrest her son.	Yari ahari gufata umuhungu we.
You need someone.	Ukeneye umuntu.
You are beautiful too.	Nawe uri mwiza.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
As if.	Nkaho.
About here.	Hafi hano.
You have to help people.	Ugomba gufasha abantu.
He was right, as usual.	Yari afite ukuri, nk'uko bisanzwe.
Since then, he has not asked any questions.	Kuva icyo gihe, nta kibazo yabajije.
But you can do something good here.	Ariko urashobora gukora ikintu cyiza hano.
But, for me.	Ariko, kuri njye.
This is not the day.	Uyu si uwo munsi.
It's inside me.	Ni imbere muri njye.
Mary was a beautiful girl.	Mariya yari umukobwa mwiza.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari amakosa.
He was a young man.	Yari umusore.
And that is all.	Kandi ibyo aribyo byose.
I don't have to know anything else.	Ntabwo ngomba kumenya ikindi kintu.
I'm not sure why.	Ntabwo nzi neza impamvu.
Looking ahead.	Kureba imbere.
It's a great swim.	Ni koga cyane.
You are here.	Urimo hano.
He was no longer human.	Ntabwo yari akiri umuntu.
You can't help but feel that way.	Ntushobora kureka kumva neza ibyo.
You can't wait to get back to the schedule.	Ntushobora gutegereza gusubira muri gahunda.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
And there is a reason.	Kandi hariho impamvu.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
If you want to know.	Niba ushaka kumenya.
Read well.	Gusoma neza.
I have to get out of here.	Ngomba kuva hano.
I don't want money.	Ntashaka amafaranga.
It's okay, like, at the same time.	Nibyiza, nka, mugihe kimwe.
No one, you have the truth about everything.	Nta muntu n'umwe, ufite ukuri kuri byose.
He wanted to have everything.	Yashakaga ko agira byose.
It looks exactly right.	Birasa neza neza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikibazo cyiza.
And it won’t be.	Kandi ntabwo bizaba.
He was well aware that.	Yari azi neza ko.
What to do?	Gukora iki?
But it is not, and it is not.	Ariko sibyo, kandi sibyo.
He was there that day.	Uwo munsi yari ahari.
He started this.	Yatangiye ibi.
You have to.	Ugomba.
Tom was embarrassed.	Tom yagize isoni.
That's all there is to it.	Ibintu byose nibyo.
He came almost always.	Yaje hafi buri gihe.
He had enough.	Yari afite bihagije.
I know what he wants.	Nzi icyo ashaka.
Let it all go.	Kureka byose.
He was obviously human.	Biragaragara ko yari umuntu.
And there are not many of us.	Kandi nta benshi muri twe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was too much, too much.	Byari byinshi cyane, birashoboka cyane.
And he is.	Kandi ni we.
It wasn't good to be around me.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuba hafi yanjye.
Maybe his father.	Ahari na se.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I knew exactly what to do.	Nari nzi neza icyo yari gukora.
It wasn’t just you.	Ntabwo wari usa gusa.
He had to do something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo akora.
This, of course, is obvious.	Ibi, birashoboka, biragaragara.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byoroshye.
Who can help?	Ninde ushobora gufasha?
He is.	Niwe.
I just know it's good here.	Gusa nzi ko ari byiza hano.
All of that was his fault.	Ibyo byose byari amakosa ye.
He really wants to talk.	Arashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
But it was better than that.	Ariko byari byiza kuruta ibyo.
I never wanted to.	Sinigeze nshaka.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
There is so much to know.	Hariho byinshi byo kumenya.
They are children	Abana ni
I don't have time to do this.	Ntabwo mfite umwanya wo gukora ibi.
Too much meditation and reading.	Gutekereza cyane no gusoma.
I'm glad you're here today.	Nishimiye ko uri hano uyu munsi.
I know exactly what he means.	Nzi neza icyo ashaka kuvuga.
We would do something for everyone.	Twari gukora ikintu kuri buri wese.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Dog.	Imbwa.
Probably not a good idea.	Birashoboka ko atari igitekerezo cyiza.
And who he is.	Kandi uwo yaba ari we.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
It's almost there.	Hafi gato.
You were so beautiful.	Wari mwiza cyane.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
She is not a girl.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa.
At the time, he was well aware.	Icyo gihe yari azi neza.
He is reading a book.	Arimo gusoma igitabo.
I have one of them.	Mfite kimwe muri byo.
I know fear.	Nzi ubwoba.
He is one person.	Ni umuntu umwe.
I guess he didn't want to tell me.	Ndakeka ko adashaka kumbwira.
One has to know how to do it right.	Umuntu agomba kumenya kubikora neza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You are not as low as you are.	Ntabwo uri hasi nkuko uri.
I am very low.	Ndi hasi cyane.
This is probably what you want.	Ibi birashoboka ko aribyo ushaka.
But not really.	Ariko ntabwo mubyukuri.
He thought about it a lot.	Yatekereje kuri byinshi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But he was not ready to give up.	Ariko ntiyari yiteguye kureka.
Not sure what to do?	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo ukora?
I like this.	Nkunda ibi.
You can talk to him.	Urashobora kuvugana na we.
You can tell me down.	Urashobora kumbwira hasi.
There is only one thing to do.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa cyo gukora.
It has not always been easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byari byoroshye.
Where were we at the time.	Twari he igihe.
He was a young child.	Yari umwana muto.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva uri hasi cyane.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
All together	Byose hamwe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kubaho mubyukuri.
Not just outside.	Ntabwo ari gusa no hanze.
He wanted to go home.	Yashakaga gutaha.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
I thought it was really good.	Natekereje ko byari byiza rwose.
It is very small, and ,, very beautiful.	Ni muto cyane, kandi ,, mwiza cyane.
It’s not just me, it’s me.	Ntabwo ari njye kuri njye, wenyine.
Many are unlucky.	Benshi ntabwo bafite amahirwe.
Or you can.	Cyangwa urashobora.
I can go at any time.	Nshobora kugenda igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
And on and on and on, and on.	Kandi kuri no kuri no kuri, no kuri.
They have an idea.	Bafite igitekerezo.
What he would say.	Icyo yari kuvuga.
She will be absolutely beautiful.	Azaba mwiza rwose.
I didn't have one.	Ntabwo nari mfite.
You have a lot.	Ufite byinshi.
You can't wait.	Ntushobora gutegereza.
In fact, it was great.	Mubyukuri, byari byiza cyane.
Tonight, we all need to stay together.	Iri joro, twese tugomba kuguma hamwe.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
The food is really good and plentiful.	Ibiryo ni byiza rwose kandi ni byinshi.
I feel good about eating.	Numva ari byiza kurya.
She was probably her child.	Yari ahari umwana we.
And that things went wrong.	Kandi ko ibintu byagenze nabi.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
In fact, sometimes it's the same guy.	Mubyukuri, rimwe na rimwe ni umusore umwe.
We can't stay here.	Ntidushobora kuguma hano.
It was you.	Wari wowe.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
I do not understand.	Ntabwo numva.
I'm sure it's you.	Nzi neza ko ari wowe.
We are in one of those.	Turi muri kimwe muri ibyo.
You want to do it that way, okay with me.	Urashaka kubikora gutya, neza nanjye.
We have to travel a lot.	Tugomba kugenda cyane.
And this is his place.	Kandi aha ni umwanya we.
You can have this for me.	Urashobora kugira iyi kuri njye.
Anyone with any ideas.	Umuntu wese ufite igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
'	'
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
You want to come here.	Ushaka kuza hano.
I'm sure he shouldn't.	Nzi neza ko atagomba.
They were just good friends.	Bari inshuti nziza gusa.
You know how good it was.	Uzi uburyo byari byiza.
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
Let's leave it here.	Reka reka hano.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo gukora.
I needed to do it.	Nari nkeneye kubikora.
He was young.	Yari muto.
So far everything has gone well.	Kugeza ubu ibintu byose byagenze neza.
That you are the one.	Ko ari wowe uwo.
This one was not the same.	Uyu na we ntiyari uwo.
But he said nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yavuze.
He did not need children.	Ntiyari akeneye abana.
I have to do something.	Ngomba kugira icyo nkora.
He has to go to jail.	Agomba kujya muri gereza.
All the same.	Byose kimwe.
It's a long time.	Ni igihe kirekire.
I don't know why we're here.	Sinzi impamvu turi hano.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
Today, nothing.	Uyu munsi, nta na kimwe.
What do you think of the house?	Utekereza iki ku nzu?
I felt bad.	Numvise nabi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Little did he know that this was exactly what he needed to do.	Ntabwo yari azi ko aricyo kintu yari akeneye gukora.
I saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe nabonye.
It's the same here.	Ni kimwe hano.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
It was good to work.	Byari byiza gukora.
He was very young.	Yari akiri muto cyane.
We can do nothing.	Ntacyo dushobora gukora.
Like, All.	Nka, Byose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
That we are a family.	Ko turi umuryango.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, uri mubi cyane gukina.
He enjoyed his new car.	Yishimiye imodoka ye nshya.
But one thing is for sure.	Ariko ni ikintu, birashoboka.
I shouldn’t have eaten too much.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kurya cyane.
Who knew he had.	Ninde wari uzi ko afite.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari byose.
He needed to go home.	Yari akeneye gutaha.
He was just happy to be there.	Yishimiye gusa ko ahari.
Too much walking.	Kugenda cyane.
The problem is, someone did it.	Ikibazo nuko, umuntu yabikoze.
I should not have worried.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugira impungenge.
That's right, isn't it?	Nibyiza, sibyo?
Like reading?	Nkuko wo gusoma?
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
We all had a job.	Twese twari dufite akazi.
That's what he says.	Ibyo avuga nibyo.
I know he was.	Nzi ko yari.
About yes.	Hafi ya.
But no one.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe.
Definitely going to do it again.	Rwose ngiye kongera kubikora.
He is a very bad person.	Ni umuntu mubi cyane.
I am.	Ndi we.
Have a great day.	Umunsi mwiza rwose.
And he knew exactly where he was.	Kandi yari azi neza aho ari.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
No one seems to be working.	Nta n'umwe usa naho ukora.
He had everything he needed.	Ibyo yari akeneye byose.
He was close, close.	Yari hafi, hafi.
I like simple things.	Nkunda ibintu byoroshye.
I know how he works.	Nzi uko akora.
It's you	Ni wowe.
This time with many plans.	Iki gihe hamwe na gahunda nyinshi.
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.

We have your clothes.	Dufite imyenda yawe.
It's a good day.	Ni umunsi mwiza.
None of us did.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wigeze abikora.
What he looked like was good.	Ibyo yasaga byari byiza.
She is in school.	Ari mwishuri.
But he was a very good player.	Ariko yari umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
He also chose that.	Ibyo na byo yahisemo.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
Smart kids.	Abana bafite ubwenge.
But he saw nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
Ever since they were children.	Kuva bari abana.
He would not have gone without it.	Ntabwo yari kugenda adafite.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
You are so beautiful	Waba mwiza cyane.
Tell me why.	Mbwira impamvu.
He is a very intelligent person.	Ni umuntu uzi ubwenge cyane.
I feel nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe numva.
He has his book.	Afite igitabo cye.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
If there are people.	Niba hari abantu.
I did wrong.	Nakoze nabi.
We were.	Twari.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
That would be nice and easy.	Ibyo byaba ari byiza kandi byoroshye.
I think that's enough.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bihagije.
Who he is	Ni uwo ari we.
I'm afraid there is one.	Mfite ubwoba ko hariho umwe.
There is a girl here.	Hano hari umukobwa.
This is great.	Ibi nibyiza cyane.
He said it was a good plan.	Yavuze ko yari gahunda nziza.
I love both.	Nkunda bombi.
Just to have.	Kugira gusa.
Have you ever thought about what you are going to say?	Wigeze utekereza kubyo ugiye kuvuga?
I should not have lived to this day.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubaho kugeza uyu munsi.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
One every day.	Umwe buri munsi.
But it is not food.	Ariko si ibyo kurya.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
I wanted him to go.	Nashakaga ko agenda.
He also had things to do.	Na we yari afite ibintu byo gukora.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
She is better than her son.	Ni ikintu cyiza kuruta umuhungu we.
In fact, that's not good.	Mubyukuri, ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
Much to learn.	Byinshi byo kwiga.
He was absolutely there.	Yari ahari rwose.
He, who saw the dog, said nothing.	We, wabonye imbwa, ntacyo yavuze.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But things are really worse than that.	Ariko ibintu mubyukuri mubi kuruta ibyo.
That's when he agreed to leave.	Icyo gihe ni bwo yemeye kugenda.
It could have been something.	Ashobora kuba yari ikintu.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I don't want to do bad things.	Sinshaka gukora ibintu nabi.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
I'm trying.	Ndi kugerageza.
It seems.	Birasa.
Nothing very good.	Nta kintu cyiza cyane.
But really.	Ariko rwose.
He was now a real man.	Ubu yari umuntu rwose.
I knew that.	Nari nzi uko.
And this is my house.	Kandi iyi ni yo nzu yanjye.
He was a bad person.	Yari umuntu mubi.
I can't work either.	Nanjye sinshobora gukora.
And here.	Kandi hano.
At the time, he was 20 years old.	Icyo gihe, yari afite imyaka 20.
That would be great.	Ibyo byaba ari ibintu byiza cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Something to know and to know.	Ikintu cyo kumenya no kumenya.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
I think about that sometimes.	Ntekereza kuri ibyo rimwe na rimwe.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
If he is gone.	Niba yagiye.
I don't have to do anything.	Ntabwo ngomba gukora ikintu.
I didn't want to see much.	Sinifuzaga kubona byinshi.
You would go.	Wari kugenda.
He was very young.	Yari akiri muto cyane.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I was on my way to work.	Nari ngiye ku kazi.
But he was right.	Ariko yari afite ukuri.
There is so much you can do.	Hariho byinshi ushobora gukora.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona na rimwe.
It was his book.	Yari igitabo cye.
He had no problem with that.	Nta kibazo yari afite kuri ibyo.
We are not the same people.	Ntabwo turi abantu umwe.
And you don’t like a boy.	Kandi ntabwo ukunda umuhungu.
He could have lived with that.	Yashoboraga kubana nibyo.
Man, that was great!	Muntu, byari byiza!
All this together.	Ibi byose hamwe.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza kubona.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
I think they were very close.	Ntekereza ko bari hafi cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Reading or eating.	Gusoma cyangwa kurya.
He has never had a problem before.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ikibazo mbere.
I was human.	Nari umuntu.
He was my friend.	Yari inshuti yanjye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He has a family.	Afite umuryango.
I was about to win.	Nari hafi gutsinda.
And he would go too.	Kandi na we yari kugenda.
All of this here.	Ibi byose hano.
I didn’t know it would do that.	Sinari nzi ko byari kubikora.
Outside.	Hanze.
There are more people here than usual.	Hano hari abantu benshi cyane kuruta uko byari bisanzwe.
He is.	Ni we.
You can help.	Urashobora gufasha.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
And there are many.	Kandi hariho benshi.
It was a thing.	Byari ibintu.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
I can't say that.	Sinshobora kuvuga kuri ibyo.
He thought maybe he needed it.	Yatekerezaga ko ahari yari akeneye.
I thought you said you wanted to help.	Natekereje ko wavuze ko ushaka gufasha.
He has to be here very soon.	Agomba kuba hano vuba cyane.
I'm not sure what that is, exactly.	Sinzi neza icyo aricyo, neza.
It would be really easy.	Byaba byoroshye rwose.
You have to work alone.	Ugomba gukora wenyine.
That's what he knew.	Nibyo yari azi.
You are a good boy.	Uri umuhungu mwiza.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
She loves my daughter.	Akunda umukobwa wanjye.
But he did a lot.	Ariko yakoze cyane.
Let's, let's.	Reka, reka.
He was sure he was going to try again.	Yari azi neza ko agiye kongera kugerageza.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
He is just one person.	Ni umuntu umwe gusa.
Now we have to go and do it.	Ubu tugomba kujya kubikora.
Looks like a good plan.	Birasa na gahunda nziza.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza kubona.
Or a party.	Cyangwa ibirori.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
Later, he went outside as usual.	Nyuma, yagiye hanze nkuko bisanzwe.
I need	Nkeneye.
I wanted to be a child.	Nashakaga kuba umwana.
But that is another matter.	Ariko icyo ni ikindi kibazo.
He obviously has his thing.	Biragaragara ko afite ikintu cye.
You can't have that.	Ntushobora kugira ibyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
I haven't seen it since.	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona.
He travels a lot and is always gone.	Agenda cyane kandi ahora yagiye.
Here, it is for everyone.	Hano, ni kuri buri wese.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
I don't know anything else.	Sinzi ikindi.
He did not have his phone.	Ntabwo yari afite terefone ye.
Her hair was bad.	Umusatsi we wari mubi.
Like many, in fact.	Kimwe na benshi, mubyukuri.
Always the same.	Igihe cyose ni kimwe.
Or a friend.	Cyangwa inshuti.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
.	.
I don't know who you are.	Ntabwo nzi uwo uri we.
He was looking for money.	Yashakaga amafaranga.
That was enough.	Byari bihagije.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari muto, mubyukuri.
Play everything you love from tomorrow to today.	Gukina ibyo ukunda byose kuva ejo kugeza uyu munsi.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
Money, money, money!	Amafaranga, amafaranga, amafaranga!
Later, later.	Nyuma, nyuma.
He was embarrassed.	Yari afite isoni.
You have a lot of money.	Ufite amafaranga menshi.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He said he did not know why.	Yavuze ko atazi impamvu.
Something above.	Ikintu hejuru.
That was before.	Ibyo byari mbere.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
The young man admitted to being scared.	Umusore yemeye ko afite ubwoba.
You have to have a way.	Ugomba kugira uburyo.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
I hope it will be early.	Ndizera ko bizaba kare.
I was well aware of that little thing.	Nari nzi neza icyo kintu gito.
That phone call is not good.	Iyo terefone yawe ntabwo ari nziza.
If you want to do well, you can.	Niba ushaka gukora neza, urashobora.
He was sure he had.	Yizeye neza ko yari afite.
And not just me.	Kandi si njye gusa.
The house is beautiful.	Inzu ni nziza.
He has not acted since.	Kuva icyo gihe ntabwo yakoze.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora.
But it is a plan.	Ariko ni gahunda.
But that's right.	Ariko ibyo ni byo.
He is a player.	Ni umukinnyi.
I'm not sure what to do about it.	Sinzi neza icyo gukora kuri ibyo.
But that is not what happened.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo byagenze.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
And he.	Na we.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Nibyiza kuruta kugenda.
He knows the plan.	Azi gahunda.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
Really good guy.	Mubyukuri umusore mwiza.
Things were great.	Ibintu byari byiza cyane.
That is why.	Iyo ni yo mpamvu.
If you need anything.	Niba hari icyo ukeneye.
He is my best friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye nziza.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko yabikoze.
You have to try !.	Ugomba kugerageza!.
He looked away.	Yarebye kure.
She is my child.	Ni umwana wanjye.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
You have faith.	Ufite kwizera.
I really had no reason.	Ntabwo rwose nari mfite impamvu.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He knew nothing.	Nta cyo yari azi.
But he never felt happy.	Ariko ntiyigeze yumva yishimiye.
Everything.	Byose.
My car is good.	Imodoka yanjye ni nziza.
You too.	Nawe.
And not now.	Kandi si ubu.
It was not a chance.	Ntabwo byari amahirwe.
I always thought it was great.	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko byari byiza cyane.
Where could he go?	Yashoboraga kujya he?
It was a car.	Yari imodoka.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He said he was fine there.	Yavuze ko yari mwiza ahari.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He just had to think.	Yagombaga gutekereza gusa.
This is nothing.	Ibi ntacyo.
You are talking.	Urimo kuvuga.
But one cannot know things well.	Ariko umuntu ntashobora kumenya neza ibintu.
Things are similar here.	Ibintu birasa hano.
He would not understand.	Ntabwo yari kumva.
We are all about to win.	Twese turi hafi gutsinda.
Tomorrow is Sunday.	Ejo hari ku cyumweru.
Drink too much.	Kunywa cyane.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
We have to do it now.	Tugomba kubikora ubu.
I like my hair.	Nkunda umusatsi wanjye.
That was difficult.	Ibyo byari bigoye.
Before doing so.	Mbere yo kubikora.
Here we were all.	Hano twese twari.
Probably me too.	Birashoboka nanjye.
So many people, that.	Abantu cyane, ibyo.
He needed to eat more.	Yari akeneye kurya byinshi.
I need money.	Nkeneye amafaranga.
He was really worried.	Yari afite impungenge rwose.
It is faith.	Ni kwizera.
We are not here.	Ntabwo turi hano.
You said a lot.	Wavuze byinshi.
I don't think it would be difficult.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko byaba bigoye.
But he said it was not.	Ariko yavuze ko atari byo.
I don't know what to think.	Sinzi icyo ntekereza.
I don’t have time for everyone.	Ntabwo mfite umwanya kuri buri wese.
It's not down.	Ntabwo ari hasi.
But here's the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo kibi.
He says he has a good idea.	Avuga ko afite igitekerezo cyiza.
Quit.	Kureka.
You've talked to him before.	Wigeze kuvugana nawe mbere.
It's okay to be nice sometimes.	Nibyiza kugira neza rimwe na rimwe.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda na gato.
Anyway, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo yari afite ikibazo kinini.
They were here, now they are not.	Bari hano, ubu ntabwo bari.
He heard her walk behind him.	Yumvise kugenda inyuma ye.
However, he was very worried.	Ariko, yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
No big deal.	Nta kibazo kinini.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He was far from me.	Yari kure yanjye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
And we have nothing to do.	Kandi ntacyo dufite cyo gukora.
He knew he was ready.	Yari azi ko yari yiteguye.
I like to do things.	Nkunda gukora ibintu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ikintu cyiza.
In any case first.	Kuri ibyo aribyo byose mbere.
There is a drink.	Hariho kunywa.
I have a daughter.	Mfite umukobwa.
No one can do everything.	Nta muntu ushobora gukora byose.
Why not?	Kuki atari byo?
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I knew then.	Icyo gihe nari nzi.
She wants to go home.	Ashaka gutaha.
You're just scared.	Gusa ufite ubwoba.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
That would be in each of us.	Ibyo byaba muri buri wese muri twe.
Apparently he loved both.	Biragaragara ko yakundaga bombi.
he said.	yavuze.
And you think.	Kandi uratekereza.
I don't really want to.	Sinshaka rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But he wanted more.	Ariko yashakaga byinshi.
My house is beautiful.	Inzu yanjye nziza.
At the time, I didn't think of anything.	Icyo gihe nta kintu na kimwe natekerezaga.
She thought she was beautiful.	Yatekereje ko yari mwiza.
That's right.	Ibyo ni byo ariko.
I am learning a lot.	Ndimo kwiga byinshi.
It's a short time.	Ni umwanya muto.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, birasa nabi.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
Yes, he is happy to be like his father.	Nibyo, yishimiye kuba nka se.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
But that is not what I do.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo nkora.
This is it.	Ubu ni bwo.
I wanted to see what you look like.	Nashakaga kureba uko usa.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I mean, you can stay with me.	Ndashaka kuvuga, urashobora kuguma hamwe nanjye.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo byari kugenda.
There is so much to do!	Hariho byinshi byo gukora!
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
I don't want to do that all the time.	Sinshaka kubikora buri gihe.
It was just in him.	Byari muri we gusa.
I don't have much time.	Ntabwo mfite igihe kinini.
It was really easy to see.	Kubona byari byoroshye rwose.
This time with a very nice person.	Iki gihe hamwe numuntu mwiza cyane.
It all looks so good.	Byose birasa neza neza.
He wants to go and do something else.	Ashaka kujya gukora ikindi kintu.
I don't want to go back.	Sinshaka gusubira inyuma.
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo yari cyo.
Anyone could have something in their house.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kugira ibyo mu nzu ye.
It was not his time to do anything.	Ntabwo yari umwanya we wo gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
We had a lot of good plans.	Twari dufite gahunda nyinshi nziza.
Outside.	Hanze.
Being outside was difficult.	Kuba hanze byari bigoye.
I don't want to be his friend.	Sinshaka kuba inshuti ye.
A girl loves a girl.	Umukobwa akunda umukobwa.
I wanted to know where he was.	Nashakaga kumenya aho ari.
That's not true!	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri!
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He started thinking about everything.	Yatangiye gutekereza kuri byose.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I tried.	Nigeze kugerageza.
In fact they were nothing.	Mubyukuri ntacyo bari cyo.
I was not scared at all.	Ntabwo nagize ubwoba na gato.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I can't do it right.	Sinshobora kubikora neza.
It is not a good thing to learn.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza cyo kwiga.
He used to drive his car.	Yakundaga gutwara imodoka ye.
If you want to succeed, you have to work hard.	Niba ushaka gutsinda, ugomba gukora cyane.
Apparently the woman was scared.	Biragaragara ko umugore yagize ubwoba.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
I finally found something to do.	Amaherezo nabonye ikintu cyo gukora.
That's good! 	Nibyiza!
Someone like him.	Umuntu usa na we.
You too.	Nawe.
It really was.	Byari ibintu rwose.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
The best part is, you really have to do it.	Byiza byoroshye, mubyukuri, gusa ugomba kubona kubikora.
You don't have to be here.	Ntugomba kuba hano.
He loved dogs.	Yakundaga imbwa.
All so far.	Byose kugeza ubu.
He never had.	Ntabwo yigeze agira.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
How is that possible?	Nigute bishoboka.
And I didn’t hear much of it.	Kandi ntabwo numvise byinshi muri byo.
It really is a big deal.	Nukuri ni ikintu kinini.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ikintu cyiza.
You have to go by bus.	Ugomba kujya muri bisi.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Everyone has that.	Umuntu wese afite ibyo.
He was not one.	Ntabwo yari umwe.
They were too far away.	Bari kure cyane.
But that is not the case.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo cyiza.
You are right.	Ufite ukuri.
Everyone was outside.	Abantu bose bari hanze.
We were a family.	Twari umuryango.
You have your time.	Ufite umwanya wawe.
That is the same thing.	Icyo ni ikintu kimwe.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
I needed a lot of money.	Nari nkeneye amafaranga menshi.
I can't believe it's me.	Ntashobora kwizera ko ari njye.
That was a concern.	Ibyo byari impungenge.
You don’t have to think.	Ntugomba gutekereza.
Where is he? 	Ari he?
Something without going backwards.	Ikintu nta gusubira inyuma.
I don't have a house.	Ntabwo mfite inzu.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
But this is not really the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo mubyukuri.
You had.	Wari ufite.
He wanted her to leave.	Yashakaga ko agenda.
There are many.	Hariho benshi.
You can go fast.	Urashobora kugenda vuba.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It would be so easy.	Byaba byoroshye cyane.
I knew it was him.	Nari nzi ko ari we.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
You've probably been here before.	Birashoboka ko wigeze kuba hano mbere.
It's bad!	Ari mubi!
Not many friends.	Ntabwo ari inshuti nyinshi.
You are working hard.	Urimo gukora cyane.
But there is one thing everyone should know.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe buri wese agomba kumenya.
He tried to get to work.	Yagerageje kujya ku kazi.
He did not know where.	Ntiyari azi aho.
More here.	Byinshi hano.
He used to talk a lot.	Yakundaga kuvuga cyane.
I love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa.
But that is another matter.	Ariko icyo ni ikindi kibazo.
That's great and we are.	Nibyiza cyane kandi turi.
That's what he said.	Ibyo ni byo yavuze.
I never had to ask for anything.	Ntabwo nigeze ngomba gusaba ikintu na kimwe.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
That's what he said.	Nibyo yari yavuze.
He is ready to do his day.	Yiteguye gukora umunsi we.
And in fact, it was.	Kandi mu kuri, ni ko yari.
I'm about to leave.	Ndi hafi yo kugenda.
Absolutely this.	Ibi rwose.
I think it's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
The girl is right.	Umukobwa afite ukuri.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You know you have.	Uzi ko ufite.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
You are doing what you have to do.	Urimo ukora ibyo ugomba.
I can't understand what you mean.	Sinshobora kumva icyo ushaka kuvuga.
You weren't working.	Ntabwo wari ukora.
To know	Kumenya.
It was all up to him.	Byose byari kuri we.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
Same with you.	Kimwe nawe.
He knew what he wanted.	Yari azi icyo ashaka.

Money or.	Amafaranga cyangwa.

Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo byari ukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But we need to go far.	Ariko dukeneye kujya kure.
I want to go to that room.	Ndashaka kujya muri icyo cyumba.
He could not see or hear anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona cyangwa kumva.
You want something else.	Urashaka ikindi kintu.
Especially my daughter.	Cyane cyane umukobwa wanjye.
I liked his idea.	Nishimiye igitekerezo cye.
It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
Someone is looking back.	Umuntu arimo kureba inyuma.
The food here was good.	Ibiryo hano byari byiza.
In it.	Muri yo.
He asked if you could find time for him today.	Yabajije niba ushobora kubona umwanya kuri we uyu munsi.
He wanted to take over.	Yashakaga gufata.
Not to mention.	Nta kuvuga.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
He knew it was going to be very easy.	Yari azi ko byari byoroshye cyane.

She is very beautiful.	Ari mwiza cyane.

We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
He didn't want to.	Ntabwo yashakaga.
He probably didn't know what it was.	Birashoboka ko atari azi icyo aricyo.
He should not stay.	Ntagomba kuguma.
And here it is.	Hano kandi ntabwo ahari.
It was at the same time.	Byari mugihe kimwe.

It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
I mean, that's not true.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko atari byo.
And you need something to do.	Kandi ukeneye ikintu cyo gukora.
But no one did.	Ariko nta n'umwe yabikoze.
They have.	Bafite.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
Or even do it.	Cyangwa no kubikora.
Or not you now.	Cyangwa si wowe ubu.
Do you want it now?	Urashaka ubu?
She is scared before eating.	Agira ubwoba mbere yo kurya.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
I can't even talk to you.	Sinshobora no kuvugana nawe.
You know where you want to go.	Uzi aho ushaka kujya.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
We have to have that.	Tugomba kugira ibyo.
It was very common so far.	Byari bisanzwe cyane kugeza ubu.
Eventually, he got his chance.	Amaherezo, yabonye amahirwe ye.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
He did very well.	Yakoze neza cyane.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
And for no reason.	Kandi nta mpamvu.
It's not a bad idea at all.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi na gato.
Give up or try.	Kureka cyangwa kugerageza.
He didn't have to figure out why.	Ntabwo yagombaga kumenya impamvu.
I made a lot of money.	Nabonye amafaranga menshi.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
Good thing to have.	Ikintu cyiza cyo kugira.
It is best to have a plan for retreat.	Nibyiza kugira gahunda yo gusubira inyuma.
He loved the outdoors.	Yakundaga hanze.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
We really needed the money.	Twari dukeneye amafaranga rwose.
I am very happy to do so.	Nishimiye cyane kubikora.
I can't be the only person here.	Ntabwo nshobora kuba umuntu wenyine hano.
They would not just read the book.	Ntabwo bari gusoma igitabo gusa.
He told me he was in his room.	Yambwiye ko ari mu cyumba cye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You can't see anything.	Ntushobora kubona ikintu na kimwe.
I'm sure now.	Nzi neza ko ubu.
He is only three years old.	Afite imyaka itatu gusa.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He thought he had no good.	Yatekereje ko nta cyiza yari afite.
He needed to go.	Yari akeneye ko agenda.
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
His father went to work every morning.	Se yagiye ku kazi buri gitondo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo aribyo.
Not in his time.	Ntabwo ari mugihe cye.
He told me not to go.	Yambwiye ko ntagomba kugenda.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibi birasa neza.
There is, however, something great.	Hariho, ariko, hari ikintu kinini.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
You should not stop studying.	Ntugomba guhagarika kwiga.
He thought he was not at the same time.	Yatekereje ko atari mu gihe kimwe.
She is not a girl.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa.
And he did something.	Kandi yagize icyo akora.
He knows who he is.	Azi uwo ari we.
That is something else he said.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu yavuze.
We have to make money.	Tugomba kubona amafaranga.
He is intelligent and thoughtful.	Ni umuntu uzi ubwenge kandi utekereza.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
Everyone should talk to me.	Umuntu wese agomba kuvugana nanjye.
It's good here.	Hano ni byiza.
We were! 	Twari twe!
I want to.	Ndashaka.
He was not human.	Ntiyari umuntu.
Much of that.	Byinshi muri ibyo.
It was good and good.	Byari byiza kandi byiza.
That's fine now.	Nibyiza ubu.
It's nothing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu na kimwe.
But this is what he did.	Ariko ibi nibyo yakoze.
That was easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye.
That's good!	Nibyiza!
This whole thing.	Iki kintu cyose.
He could have something to eat.	Yashoboraga kugira icyo ashaka kurya.
What do you think	Uratekereza iki?
We would do it in a short time.	Twari kubikora mugihe gito.
That would be.	Ibyo byaba.
It's good to think.	Nibyiza gutekereza cyane.
And that was usually enough.	Kandi byari bisanzwe bihagije.
But he had gone too far.	Ariko yari yagiye kure cyane.
You have to find someone.	Ugomba gushaka umuntu.
You are not too bad.	Ntabwo uri mubi cyane.
However, doing this well is not easy.	Ariko, gukora ibi neza ntabwo byoroshye.
He is trying to figure out what to do.	Arimo kugerageza gushaka icyo gukora.
You don't have to do that.	Ntugomba kubikora.
The viewing area is included.	Umwanya wo kureba urimo.
This is a great thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza cyane.
I understand this very well.	Ndumva neza ibi.
This is good.	Iyi ni nziza.
But you have to go.	Ariko ugomba kugenda.
But it was close.	Ariko byari ibintu hafi.
Who did it?	Ninde wabikoze?
, no.	, na.
That is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibintu.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
He thought he should not be alone.	Yatekereje ko atagomba kuba wenyine.
He heard instead of seeing.	Yumvise aho kubona.
He has a lot in his father.	Afite byinshi muri se.
He can also talk here.	Ashobora kandi kuvugana hano.
Is this a bad person?	Uyu ni umuntu mubi?
She is watching her children.	Arimo kureba abana be.
We can't do that together now.	Ntidushobora no kubikora hamwe nonaha.
He did.	Yabikoze.
There is only one.	Hariho gusa.
You don't have to do that.	Ntugomba kubikora.
Outside, outside, outside.	Hanze, hanze, hanze.
But he says nothing.	Ariko ntacyo avuga.
She would be a woman.	Yaba umugore.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
This is a great book.	Iki ni igitabo cyiza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
But you have to stay here.	Ariko ugomba kuguma hano.
He was nearby.	Yari hafi aho.
I don't like this.	Ntabwo nkunda ibi.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
Very good.	Cyiza cyane.
I don't know where.	Sinzi aho.
This sounds good to me.	Ibi birasa neza kuri njye.
And he was worried.	Kandi yagize impungenge.
We are a gift.	Ni impano.
But something else at the time.	Ariko ikindi kintu icyo gihe.
It's so beautiful, so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane, mwiza cyane.
Dog.	Imbwa.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nawe.
There was not much in him.	Ntabwo byari byinshi muri we.
In the movie.	Muri firime.
Much was true.	Byinshi byari ukuri.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye gukora.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane.
He hears everything.	Yumva ibintu byose.
But nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
He was.	Yari we.
Whatever you think.	Ibyo ari byo byose ushobora gutekereza.
Na se.	Na se.
I mean, here.	Ndashaka kuvuga, hano.
They have a lot of good things.	Bafite ibintu byinshi byiza.
You don't have to see anything.	Ntugomba kubona ikintu na kimwe.
If it is nothing, it is nothing.	Niba ari ntacyo, ntacyo.
I got the chance.	Nabonye amahirwe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You are not out.	Ntabwo uri hanze.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
Are you 	Niwowe?
You should not misunderstand anything.	Ntugomba kumva nabi ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I mean, he was good enough.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yari mwiza bihagije.
I don't believe so.	Ntabwo nizera ko aribyo.
And you know what he looks like.	Kandi uzi uko asa.
But today is not a good day.	Ariko uyu munsi ntabwo ari umunsi mwiza.
You love the truth.	Ukunda ukuri.
He chose to.	Yahisemo ko agomba.
I didn't want to.	Ntabwo nashakaga.
If not, they would be down.	Niba atari byo, bari kuba hasi.
But you are inside.	Ariko uri imbere.
Simple is the best.	Byoroshye ni byiza cyane.
You have to try hard.	Ugomba kugerageza cyane.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
We are intelligent people.	Turi abantu bazi ubwenge.
Can't live together? 	Ntushobora kubana?
.	.
It is not very easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
He didn't need to talk, nor did I.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kuvuga, cyangwa nanjye nkanjye.
I never wanted to leave my last house.	Sinigeze nshaka kuva mu nzu yanjye ya nyuma.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
He wanted to know.	Yashakaga kumenya.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
And there is probably more.	Kandi birashoboka ko hari byinshi.
He is who you are.	Ni uwo uri we.
The one you have now.	Uwo ufite ubu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko atigeze akunda ibibazo.
We need a lot of money.	Dukeneye amafaranga menshi.
You can't do it right.	Ntushobora kubikora neza.
We can't be sure it's not good.	Ntidushobora kumenya ko rwose atari byiza.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
I am working hard now.	Ubu ndimo gukora cyane.
Sometimes more than money.	Rimwe na rimwe kuruta amafaranga.
Especially to do it together.	Cyane cyane kubikora hamwe.
Someone had to have help there.	Umuntu yagombaga kugira ubufasha aho.
I think so.	Ntekereza kubikora.
We have a way.	Dufite uburyo.
He didn’t have time to think, he had to work.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo gutekereza, yagombaga gukora.
But he was.	Ariko yari.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo gihe ni bwo.
Obviously, inside.	Biragaragara, imbere.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
He wouldn't even talk to you at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yari no kuvugana nawe.
Maybe we should all be.	Ahari twese tugomba kuba.
I really enjoyed the party.	Nishimiye cyane ibirori.
I know the same thing.	Nzi ikintu kimwe.
Tell me this.	Mbwira ibi.
As a matter of fact.	Nkuko mubyukuri.
That's great right now.	Nibyiza cyane ubu.
Waiting for the time.	Gutegereza igihe.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
You are nothing to me.	Ntacyo uri kuri njye.
I never believed that.	Sinigeze nizera ibyo.
I found it a problem.	Nabonye ko ari ikibazo.
It wasn’t much of that.	Ntabwo byari byinshi muri ibyo.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
I mean, that.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko.
Obviously not the same thing.	Biragaragara ko atari ikintu kimwe.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
Do it later.	Kubikora nyuma.
Where do you think a child might be?	Utekereza ko umwana ashobora kuba ari he?
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
She was a young girl.	Yari umukobwa muto.
He just thought it was.	Yatekereje gusa ko ari.
Definitely not there before.	Rwose ntabwo yari ahari mbere.
That's not what he was afraid of, though.	Ntabwo aribyo yari afite ubwoba, ariko.
How to talk to you.	Uburyo bwo kuvugana nawe.
I am also worried about this.	Nanjye mfite impungenge kuri ibi.
Snake.	Ejo.
But that was far from over.	Ariko ibyo byari kure cyane.
It's not hard enough.	Ntabwo bigoye bihagije.
You can learn, this.	Urashobora kwiga, ibi.
You can stay there.	Urashobora kuguma aho.
He said he was ready.	Yavuze ko yiteguye.
I don't like this.	Ntabwo nkunda ibi.
It wasn't something he felt right.	Ntabwo byari ibintu yumvise neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Na ????????? 	Na ?????????
Only.	Gusa.
Everything in this room was great.	Ibintu byose byari muri iki cyumba byari byiza.
It's money.	Ni amafaranga.
What we really needed was obviously.	Twari dukeneye rwose biragaragara.
He wants to win.	Ashaka gutsinda.
And he may have been right.	Kandi ashobora kuba yari afite ukuri.
You have to act as if everything was fine.	Ugomba gukora nkaho ibintu byose byari byiza.
This one was not good.	Uyu ntiyari mwiza.
We don’t have to buy.	Ntabwo tugomba kugura.
As a boy, I couldn't do that.	Nari umuhungu, sinshobora kubikora.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
You can tell he was a good person.	Urashobora kumva ko yari umuntu mwiza.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
For me, especially.	Kuri njye, cyane cyane.
It would just be.	Byaba gusa.
He was not good at being alone.	Ntabwo yari mwiza mu kuba wenyine.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
All together	Twese hamwe.
Behind him, above him.	Inyuma ye, hejuru ye.
You have to look at each person.	Ugomba kureba kuri buri muntu.
I didn't see it all.	Ntabwo nabonye byose.
Not many.	Nta benshi.
With us.	Natwe.
People know he has a lot of talent.	Abantu bazi ko afite impano cyane.
Lots of opportunities.	Amahirwe menshi.
You can't be.	Ntushobora kuba.
There is work here.	Hano hari akazi.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
However, there is a big problem here.	Ariko, hano hari ikibazo kinini.
We have to take time.	Tugomba gufata umwanya.
He was a very bad man.	Yari umuntu mubi cyane.
He seemed scared.	Yasaga naho yari afite ubwoba.
He thought he wanted the same thing he did.	Yatekerezaga ko ashaka ikintu kimwe yakoze.
I need to find something.	Nkeneye kubona ikintu.
He must know.	Agomba kumenya.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
But we must.	Ariko tugomba.
I just wanted to make sure it was there.	Nashakaga gusa kumenya neza ko ahari.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ntiyari azi ikindi gukora.
He knew it was true.	Yari azi ko ari ukuri.
But he is.	Ariko uwo ni we.
I heard something bad.	Numvise ikintu kibi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He tried to help the child.	Yagerageje gufasha umwana.
I knew what you wanted.	Nari nzi icyo ushaka.
That's really possible.	Ibyo rwose birashoboka.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
But he knew who he was.	Ariko yari azi uwo ari we.
Anyone can do it.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
He finally came home!	Amaherezo yaje murugo!
Back and forth.	Inyuma imbere.
He wanted my house.	Yashakaga inzu yanjye.
Everything was probably true.	Byose birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
He looked away in embarrassment.	Yarebye kure afite isoni.
This is much earlier than usual.	Ibi ni kare cyane kuruta uko byari bisanzwe.
That's not a bad idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi.
I feel things.	Numva ibintu.
I don't.	Ntabwo.
I also know that it is good for him.	Nzi kandi ko ari byiza kuri we.
Something really, really, really bad.	Ikintu rwose, mubyukuri, kibi rwose.
He doesn't want to live.	Ntabwo yifuza kubaho.
But everything went wrong.	Ariko ibintu byose byagenze nabi.
It's great outside.	Nibyiza cyane hanze.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
I don't know how you can go.	Sinzi uko ushobora kugenda.
What you think is true.	Ibyo utekereza nukuri.
But he has an idea.	Ariko afite igitekerezo.
We all need that sometimes.	Twese dukeneye ibyo rimwe na rimwe.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But it wasn’t very good here.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza cyane hano.
Lots of cars.	Imodoka nyinshi.
You've got a good boy.	Wabonye umuhungu mwiza.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Igihe cyo gusubira imbere.
Maybe he will actually do it.	Ahari azabikora mubyukuri.
You also feel alone.	Urimo no kumva wenyine.
There is something here for everyone.	Hano hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
Obviously something is wrong here.	Biragaragara ko hano hari ikintu kibi.
He didn't do that!	Ibyo atabikoze!
She was happy to be leaving.	Yishimiye ko yari kureka akazi.
But I can't.	Ariko ntashobora.
He wanted this.	Yashakaga ibi.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
But he was always lucky.	Ariko buri gihe yari afite amahirwe.
No one was around.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hafi ye.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
that's possible.	ni ibyo bishoboka.
And so it was.	Kandi byagenze gutya.
You need help.	Ukeneye ubufasha.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
There is a boy here who looks like you.	Hano hari umuhungu usa nawe.
I'm not him.	Ntabwo ndi we.
For many.	Kuri benshi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
You are doing well.	Urimo ukora neza.
I hope you do the right thing.	Nizere ko ukora ibintu byiza.
It's a good thing.	Ni ibintu byiza.
I just thought above.	Natekereje gusa hejuru.
He never did and never will.	Ntiyigeze agira kandi ntazigera abikora.
We have that.	Dufite ibyo.
I wanted to see.	Nashakaga kubona.
I have things to learn.	Mfite ibintu byo kwiga.
And it's very close.	Kandi ni hafi cyane.
He thought it was something.	Yatekereje ko ari ikintu.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
The first thing to learn.	Ikintu cya mbere cyo kwiga.
I'm a good guy with a problem.	Ndi umusore mwiza ufite ikibazo.
But let it be.	Ariko reka.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
If so, that's fine.	Niba aribyo, nibyiza.
And it was good, it was really hard.	Kandi byari byiza, byari bigoye rwose.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
He didn't have time before, but he would do it.	Ntiyari afite umwanya mbere, ariko yari kubikora.
It's close.	Ari hafi.
There is not much to it.	Nta byinshi kuri byo.
One can believe.	Umuntu ushobora kwizera.
He does everything in his time.	Akora byose mugihe cye.
I'm going to leave.	Ngiye kugenda.
Friends are absolutely right.	Inshuti nibyo rwose.

Same with me.	Kimwe nanjye.
So much for me really.	Byinshi cyane kuri njye rwose.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
What are you looking for.	Urimo gushaka iki.
This is really good.	Ibi mubyukuri ni byiza.
Who deserves it?	Ninde ukwiye?
If that is the case.	Niba aricyo kibazo.
Everyone has to go.	Umuntu wese agomba kugenda.
You have to do what you have to do.	Ugomba gukora ibyo ugomba.
I loved it so much.	Nari nkunda cyane.
There really is one.	Nkuko rwose hariho umwe.
He knew how to do a lot.	Yari azi gukora byinshi.
That they know better, in fact.	Ko bazi neza, mubyukuri.
Maybe you have too.	Birashoboka ko nawe ufite.

It looks exactly right.	Birasa neza neza.
In fact, they have.	Mubyukuri, bafite.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.

He would be your age.	Yaba afite imyaka yawe.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I can't do this.	Ibi ntashobora gukora.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
That seems more likely than ever.	Ibyo birasa nkaho bishoboka cyane kuruta mbere.
No one is here.	Nta muntu uri hano.
But we cannot go back.	Ariko ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
He needed to think more about his plan.	Yari akeneye gutekereza cyane kuri gahunda ye.
We have no children.	Ntabwo dufite abana.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
They have a lot of problems.	Bafite ibibazo byinshi.
We had our first child.	Twari dufite umwana wa mbere.
But I didn't know it existed.	Ariko sinari nzi ko ahari.
But it was really good.	Ariko byari byiza rwose.
But he did it right.	Ariko yabikoze neza.

I never saw her dressed.	Sinigeze mbona yambaye.
You are in my house.	Uri mu nzu yanjye.

He needed a friend.	Yari akeneye inshuti.
He had to think about what to do.	Yagombaga gutekereza icyo gukora.
Something or person.	Ikintu cyangwa umuntu.

He had a lot of money and was doing nothing.	Yari afite amafaranga menshi kandi ntacyo akora.
I can go.	Nshobora kujyana.
We were outside.	Twari hanze.
His whole family feels close to me.	Umuryango we wose numva uri hafi yanjye.
It is not the same thing as living.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe no kubaho.
You don't have to know now.	Ntugomba kumenya nonaha.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
He can be both.	Arashobora kuba bombi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
You are talking here.	Urimo kuvuga hano.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
I thought about it a lot.	Natekereje cyane kuri ibyo.
It is not in this good time.	Ntabwo ari muri iki gihe cyiza.
the teacher said.	umwarimu yavuze.
As you should.	Nkuko ugomba.
Children have many friends.	Abana bafite inshuti nyinshi.
Her youngest child	Umwana we muto

It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
And that was good advice.	Kandi iyo yari inama nziza.
I need someone.	Nkeneye umuntu.
You can be a boy.	Urashobora kuba umuhungu.
I want to buy a house.	Ndashaka kugura inzu.
He has to be close.	Agomba kuba hafi.
But it would not be here.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuba hano.
Lots.	Byinshi.
Nothing good to do.	Nta kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Easier to say than to do.	Byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
She is your daughter.	Ni umukobwa wawe.
I don't want to be alone.	Sinshaka kuba wenyine.
He thought it was not good.	Yatekereje ko atari byiza.
And he.	Na we.
Never.	Nta na rimwe.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
You have to talk to him.	Ugomba kuvugana nawe.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
He did that now.	Ibyo yabikoze ubu.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He didn't have time to do anything.	Ntiyari afite umwanya wo kugira icyo akora.
He went.	Yagiye.
No one can hear.	Nta muntu ushobora kumva.
He was dressed.	Yari yambaye.
All we need is	Ibyo dukeneye byose.
Will it be good?	Bizaba byiza?
It was just an opportunity.	Byari amahirwe gusa.
All of this was true.	Ibi byose byari ukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We only have today.	Dufite uyu munsi gusa.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza muri njye.
And let it be.	Kandi reka.
Who knew you had so many.	Ninde wari uzi ko ufite benshi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's in me.	Ni muri njye.
I hope he can get a job soon.	Nizere ko ashobora kubona akazi vuba.
He thought I should go back.	Yatekereje ko ngomba gusubira inyuma.
It is best to read the book.	Nibyiza cyane ko gusoma igitabo.
I saw that.	Nabonye ibyo.
Probably, however.	Birashoboka, ariko.
Absolutely not me.	Rwose ntabwo ari njye.
You can be anyone.	Urashobora kuba uwo uri we wese.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
You can leave here tomorrow.	Urashobora kuva hano ejo.
I guess there is one thing.	Ndakeka ko hari ikintu kimwe.
I mean, that’s good.	Ndashaka kuvuga, nibyiza.
They were three years old.	Bari bafite imyaka itatu.
House.	Inzu.
And no one ever thought he would be human.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wigeze atekereza ko azaba umuntu.
Lots.	Byinshi.
He saw what he was saying.	Yabonye icyo avuga.
But here it is.	Ariko hano ari.
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
This is not exactly the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
In front of me.	Imbere yanjye.
You are not doing well today.	Ntabwo ukora neza uyu munsi.
Or for him.	Cyangwa se kuri we.
I could never do that alone.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora gukora uwo wenyine.
I know what I'm seeing.	Nzi ibyo mbona.
He does nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora.
He had the first place.	Yari afite umwanya wa mbere.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu gito yashoboraga gukora.
I think it’s a good thing to do.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
But he never worried.	Ariko ntiyigeze agira impungenge.
Obviously that is not the case.	Biragaragara ko ibyo atari byo.
I need that.	Nkeneye ibyo.
He didn't think about it.	Ntabwo yatekereje kuri we.
One thing he could do.	Ikintu kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
He wanted something else, he wanted something else.	Yashakaga ikindi, yashakaga ikindi.
I think he didn't know what to do.	Ntekereza ko atari azi icyo gukora.
I was happy to do it.	Nari nishimiye kubikora.
You have to do that.	Ugomba gukora ibyo.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
He has been here ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe ari hano.
Just now you said you did it.	Gusa ubu wavuze ko wabikoze.
The girl is so beautiful.	Umukobwa ni mwiza cyane.
I should be nice.	Nkwiye kuba mwiza.
Only this.	Ibi gusa.
We need more of us.	Dukeneye byinshi muri twe.
That went wrong.	Ibyo byagenze nabi.
It’s not a good movie.	Ntabwo ari firime nziza.
I was nothing and no one.	Ntacyo nari cyo kandi nta muntu.
Tell me what happened.	Mbwira uko byagenze.
There is a long time here.	Hano hari igihe kirekire.
The top would be the bottom.	Hejuru yaba hasi.
He is here with us in this room.	Ari hano hamwe natwe muri iki cyumba.
He wanted to go home.	Yashakaga gusubira mu nzu.
It was a really difficult thing to do.	Byari ibintu bigoye rwose gukora.
You have to wait and see.	Ugomba gutegereza rimwe na rimwe.
But in reality, stop.	Ariko mubyukuri, reka kureka.
I wanted to do better.	Nashakaga gukora neza.
I can't say why.	Sinshobora kuvuga impamvu.
She loves school.	Akunda ishuri.
One thing for sure.	Ikintu kimwe rwose.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka mbere.
But good idea.	Ariko igitekerezo cyiza.
You can come.	Urashobora kuza.
Question?	Ikibazo?
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
Good to have you.	Nibyiza kumva ufite.
No one ever did.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze akora.
Well not everyone but that is not the case.	Nibyiza ntabwo abantu bose ariko ntabwo aribyo.
I like to read.	Nkunda gusoma.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
There are a lot of people.	Hari abantu benshi.
We are here.	Turi hano.
He is doing it behind you.	Arimo kubikora inyuma yawe.
It was not a big deal.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo kinini.
If it is money you need.	Niba ari amafaranga ukeneye.
I don't know where we are.	Ntabwo nzi aho turi.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
I have to go quickly.	Ngomba kugenda vuba.
But he came to work a little later.	Ariko yaje gukora nyuma gato.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Niki, niba aricyo cyose, kibi?
Very nice girl	Umukobwa mwiza cyane.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
He needed a plan to do so.	Yari akeneye gahunda yo kubikora.
I needed a little time to walk.	Nari nkeneye umwanya muto wo kugenda.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
That's not normal.	Ntabwo aribyo bisanzwe.
Eat.	Kurya.
But they would all be leaving eventually.	Ariko bose bari kugenda amaherezo.
He got it wrong.	Yabonye nabi.
In fact they were.	Mubyukuri bari.
Who knows why.	Ninde uzi impamvu.
He wanted to do it on his own.	Yashakaga kubikora wenyine.
I know things.	Nzi ibintu.
That is not what he expected to hear.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yiteze kumva.
Now there is no.	Ubu nta.
And you want what he wants.	Kandi ushaka icyo ashaka.
I had something to eat.	Nari mfite ibyo kurya.
I have enough food.	Mfite ibyo kurya bihagije.
I don't understand that.	Ntabwo numva ibyo.
That is not the case here.	Ntabwo ari ibintu hano.
We have to.	Tugomba.
I'm going to make money.	Ngiye gushaka amafaranga.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
In fact, it was not true.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo byari ukuri.
I thought telling a friend would be a good idea.	Natekereje kubwira inshuti byaba igitekerezo cyiza.
I needed it there.	Nari nkeneye aho.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari ukuri.
He knows he is not alone.	Azi ko atari we wenyine.
We have a son.	Dufite umuhungu.
He is not working recently.	Ntabwo akora vuba aha.
It will be a good day.	Bizaba umunsi mwiza.
I thought that.	Natekereje ko.
You don't need this.	Ntabwo ukeneye ibi.
There are people here.	Hano hari abantu.
We are your family now.	Turi umuryango wawe ubu.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
He seemed to know everyone.	Yasaga naho azi abantu bose.
This is exactly what happened.	Ibi nibyo rwose.
He thought he was there for a while.	Yatekereje ko yari ahari igihe gito.
Anyone can see what it is.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubona icyo aricyo.
Of these, he was well aware that.	Muri ibyo, yari azi neza ko.
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni igitekerezo gusa.
In fact, it looked good.	Mubyukuri, yasaga neza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
However, there is something to look forward to.	Ariko, hari ikintu cyo kureba imbere.
There is money to work in the morning.	Mu gitondo hari amafaranga yo gukora.
He says it's good.	Avuga ko ari byiza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo cyiza.
He is not like him.	Ntabwo ari nka we.
He can really do it.	Arashobora gukora rwose.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
There is only one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I knew it well enough.	Nari nzi neza bihagije.
I know the truth.	Nzi ukuri icyo aricyo.
I like to read.	Nkunda gusoma.
I had no idea.	Ntacyo natekereje.
Everything was on schedule.	Ibintu byose byari kuri gahunda.
Can you go fast?	Urashobora kugenda vuba?
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
That too was his.	Uwo na we yari we.
And not just here.	Kandi si hano gusa.
Where should we go today?	Uyu munsi tugomba kujya he?
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko ari byiza.
He wanted this.	Yashakaga ibi.
It's really good.	Ni byiza rwose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko nanjye nari icyo gihe.
It started today.	Yatangiye uyu munsi.
Maybe another time.	Ahari ikindi gihe.
I hope he never had a problem.	Nizere ko atigeze agira ibibazo.
He is playing.	Arimo gukina.
There is a chance for him.	Hariho amahirwe ye.
We are here for the same thing.	Turi hano ku kintu kimwe.
Truth in the end.	Ukuri amaherezo.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nibyo.
That top is good.	Iyo hejuru ni byiza.
I have a problem understanding why.	Mfite ikibazo cyo kumva impamvu.
I love everyone at home.	Nkunda abantu bose murugo.
We are not children.	Ntabwo turi abana.
Everyone needs a car today!	Umuntu wese akeneye imodoka uyumunsi!
He had nothing to say.	Nta cyo yari afite cyo kuvuga.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
But it is something.	Ariko ni ikintu.
The truth is, he can be very helpful.	Ukuri nuko, arashobora gufasha cyane.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
Your house is far away.	Inzu yawe iri kure cyane.
Nothing.	Ntacyo.
It was really my fault.	Byari amakosa yanjye rwose.
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
I just don't know what to do.	Gusa sinzi icyo.
Obviously, this is not good.	Biragaragara, ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
Once.	Rimwe.
He knew up and down.	Yari azi hejuru no hasi.
He knew the car.	Yari azi imodoka.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He had.	Yari afite.
He wants to work.	Arashaka gukora.
I love this beauty so much.	Nkunda iyi nziza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo.
I like to have people upstairs.	Nkunda kugira abantu hejuru.
And obviously it was good.	Kandi biragaragara ko byari byiza.
Nothing big.	Nta kintu kinini.
No one knows much about it.	Nta muntu n'umwe uzi byinshi kuri byo.
He is not right.	Ntabwo afite ukuri.
He had a lot to live for.	Yari afite byinshi byo kubaho.
Your wife is gone.	Umugore wawe yagiye.
Nothing was wrong.	Ntacyo byari cyo.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
You have to do it now, in fact.	Ugomba kubikora nonaha, mubyukuri.
The food is excellent.	Ibiryo ni byiza cyane.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
I'm sorry about everything.	Mbabajwe na byose.
This was very easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye cyane.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
You have a very nice house.	Ufite inzu nziza cyane.
They are not people here.	Ntabwo ari abantu hano.
We can't stay here.	Ntidushobora kuguma hano.
We need to live together again.	Tugomba kongera kubana.
He loved it here.	Yakundaga hano.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
He also wanted to hear.	Yashakaga no kumva.
This was easy to do.	Ibi byari byoroshye gukora.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ari ukuri.
I don't want the truth.	Sinshaka ukuri.
We, you and me.	Twe, wowe na njye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntacyo, mubyukuri.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
You don't have to do anything.	Ntugomba gukora ikintu na kimwe.
One can do this for a long time.	Umuntu arashobora gukora ibi igihe kirekire.
He had something to say about this.	Yari afite icyo avuga kuri ibi.
That he could see.	Ko yashoboraga kubona.
And now or not.	Kandi ubu cyangwa ntabwo.
But nothing came of it.	Ariko ntacyo yaje.
We all have a long view.	Twese dufite kureba kure.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
It's one of those.	Ni kimwe muri ibyo.
We have to think.	Tugomba gutekereza.
That's what you do.	Nibyo ukora.
That's right.	Nibyo.
But, that’s an idea.	Ariko, icyo ni igitekerezo.
I want to see.	Ndashaka kureba.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi.
Before you even have to apply.	Mbere yuko ugomba no gusaba.
It was great here.	Byari byiza hano.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
If any.	Niba hari.
But we have to work hard.	Ariko tugomba gukora cyane.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kubikora.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
I want to do it again.	Ndashaka kongera kubikora.
I work every day.	Nkora buri munsi.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari amakosa.
This was definitely a problem.	Ibi rwose byari ikibazo.
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza.
He had a young man.	Yari afite umusore.
Maybe a lot of things.	Ahari ibintu byinshi.
You can't believe what he's saying.	Ntushobora kwizera ibyo avuga.
Who said that.	Ninde wavuze iki.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
Or this morning, in fact, he thought.	Cyangwa muri iki gitondo, mubyukuri, yatekereje.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
Someone is smart.	Umuntu afite ubwenge.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
Of course, we can come better.	Ni ukuri, dushobora kuza neza.
And it was.	Kandi byari.
He looked at everything.	Yarebye byose.
I just wanted to say.	Nashakaga kuvuga gusa.
For me.	Kuri njye.
However, things are not easy these days.	Ariko, ibintu ntabwo byoroshye muri iki gihe.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
But he was a good man.	Ariko yari umuntu mwiza.
Nothing too bad.	Nta kintu kibi cyane.
That's right.	Nukuri.
No job at all.	Nta kazi na gato.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
Quit.	Kureka.
What are you going to do.	Ugiye iki.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
He knows how to drive.	Azi neza gutwara.
They are not children.	Ntabwo ari abana.
You can't imagine that.	Ntushobora gutekereza gutya.
But you can't stay that way.	Ariko ntushobora kuguma uko.
He had a lot of problems.	Yari afite ibibazo byinshi.
You can try.	Urashobora kugerageza.
I can't wait.	Ntashobora gutegereza.
He looked at my age.	Yarebye imyaka yanjye.
I like being me.	Nkunda kuba njye.
You can't beat the time or the years.	Ntushobora gutsinda igihe cyangwa imyaka.
Everyone loved it.	Umuntu wese yakundaga.
What is your favorite time?	Niki gihe ukunda cyane?
I was in, he was after me.	Nari ndimo, we nyuma yanjye.
He was not at fault.	Ntabwo yari afite amakosa.
Today was the day.	Uyu munsi wari umunsi.
He now had no plans.	Ubu ntiyari afite gahunda.
I want to talk about the problems everyone has after reading that.	Ndashaka kuvuga ibibazo umuntu wese afite nyuma yo gusoma ibyo.
I was lucky.	Nari amahirwe yanjye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He took first place.	Yafashe umwanya wa mbere.
I am sorry that my family is so young.	Mbabajwe nuko umuryango wanjye ari muto cyane.
This house is on a lot.	Iyi nzu iri kuri byinshi.
But in it !!.	Ariko muri yo !!.
He had no reason to back down.	Nta mpamvu yari afite yo gusubira inyuma.
I didn't get the idea.	Ntabwo nabonye igitekerezo.
That's great for him.	Nibyiza cyane kuri we.
Everything is not good.	Byose ntabwo ari byiza.
It was here before.	Byari hano mbere.
In fact he was not there.	Mubyukuri ntabwo yari ahari.
I'm happy tomorrow.	Nishimiye ejo.
He needed money.	Yari akeneye amafaranga.
I was not.	Ntabwo nari.
You want to be in that house.	Urashaka kuba muri iyo nzu.
She saw where she was dressed.	Yabonye aho yambaye.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I think that would be great.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza cyane.
I have to go back down.	Ngomba gusubira hasi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I want to leave here.	Ndashaka kuva hano.
I know he is right.	Nzi ko afite ukuri.
There is so much to eat!	Hariho ibiryo byinshi byo kurya!
Good to see.	Nibyiza kureba.
He needed to stop this.	Yari akeneye guhagarika ibi.
And here and there.	Na hano hano.
It is very high.	Ari hejuru cyane.
I don't understand this.	Ntabwo numva ibi.
Good time	Igihe cyiza.
There can be many.	Birashoboka kuba byinshi.
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
This was his house.	Iyi yari inzu ye.
Tell me where you are.	Mbwira aho uri.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
Have a nice day?	Kugira umunsi mwiza?
I was lucky here.	Nagize amahirwe hano.
Always in fact.	Igihe cyose mubyukuri.
I want to hear.	Ndashaka kumva.
I want to live.	Ndashaka kubaho.
Everything went wrong before.	Byose byagenze nabi mbere.
I want to try it today.	Ndashaka kugerageza uyu munsi.
He really didn't have to work hard.	Mubyukuri ntabwo yagombaga gukora cyane.
Wisdom.	Ubwenge.
When you know you saw it.	Iyo uzi ko wabonye.
The house was very nice.	Inzu yari nziza cyane.
It's just money.	Ni amafaranga gusa.
I can't think or speak well.	Sinshobora gutekereza cyangwa kuvuga neza.
For him.	Kuri we.
He has a high opinion of him.	Afite igitekerezo cyo hejuru kuri we.
Most of the time without looking.	Igihe kinini nta kureba.
Things are not easy right now.	Ibintu ntabwo byoroshye kuri ubu.
Well, you have to eat well.	Nibyiza, ugomba kurya neza.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
She loved to swim.	Yakundaga koga cyane.
You can be whatever you want.	Urashobora kuba icyo ushaka cyose.
I hope he has.	Nizera ko afite.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
We can never.	Ntidushobora na rimwe.
A little higher.	Hejuru gato.
And they have the truth.	Kandi bafite ukuri.
I'm not going to buy a new car.	Ntabwo ngiye kugura imodoka nshya.
They knew what he was doing.	Bari bazi ibyo yakoze.
I believe everything he says.	Nizera ibyo avuga byose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
But it was probably good.	Ariko birashoboka ko byari byiza.
Only you can do it.	Gusa ushobora kubikora.
But not here or now.	Ariko ntabwo ari hano cyangwa ubu.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
But that was good.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza.
It was a simple, simple thing.	Byari ibintu byoroshye, byoroshye.
And the boy was beautiful.	Kandi umuhungu yari mwiza.
It's your chance.	Ni amahirwe yawe.
He wanted more for us.	Yashakaga byinshi kuri twe.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
He wants to talk in the movies.	Arashaka kuvuga muri firime.
Everything was just right.	Byose byari ukuri gusa.
I can't stay here with you.	Sinshobora kuguma hano hamwe nawe.
We were here.	Twari hano.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Gifts are not.	Impano ntabwo.
But that thing.	Ariko icyo kintu.
This is good.	Ibi nibyiza.
I know what you need.	Nzi ibyo ukeneye.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we yabikoze.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
It’s something to see.	Ni ikintu cyo kubona.
You didn't see it.	Ntabwo wabonye.
And you are.	Kandi uri.
He is doing it.	Arimo kubikora.
Everyone has to do that.	Umuntu wese agomba gukora ibyo.
On top of that, it’s good to watch.	Hejuru hejuru, nibyiza kureba.
I don't want to say anything else.	Sinshaka kuvuga ikindi kintu.
You don’t have to talk to one.	Ntugomba kuvuga kugeza umwe.
We needed that for him.	Twari dukeneye ibyo kuri we.
This was one for me.	Uyu yari umwe kuri njye.
He's going to stay here, with me.	Agiye kuguma hano, hamwe nanjye.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu.
New house.	Inzu nshya.
But that was probably enough.	Ariko birashoboka ko byari bihagije.
No one had a very good thing.	Nta n'umwe wari ufite ikintu cyiza cyane.
Everyone wants all that.	Umuntu wese arashaka ibyo byose.
I think that's the case.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byo.
I was not sure what he would do.	Sinigeze nzi neza icyo azabikora.
So much so that sometimes, he thought.	Byinshi cyane rimwe na rimwe, yatekereje.
It's a good day.	Ni umunsi mwiza.
He wanted to do everything.	Yashakaga gukora byose.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
I hadn’t thought about this.	Sinari natekereje kuri ibi.
That's it! 	Ubu ni bwo!
For the first time.	Bwa mbere.

He was behind her.	Yari inyuma ye.
He chose to be her friend.	Yahisemo ko ari inshuti ye.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Inside and out.	Imbere no hejuru.
You don't have to do anything else.	Ntugomba gukora ikindi kintu.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
He was not ready, he was not ready.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye, ntabwo yari yiteguye.

That question is big.	Icyo kibazo ni kinini.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari bigoye kuri bose.
He is a very handsome young man.	Ni umusore mwiza cyane.
You really don't have to do that.	Ntugomba rwose kubikora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He was worried there.	Yari afite impungenge aho.

You and I are now.	Ni wowe na njye ubu.
It was a lot.	Byari byinshi.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
He has to do it on his own.	Agomba kubikora wenyine.
I don't want to see this.	Sinshaka kubona ibi.
But we have to get out of here.	Ariko tugomba kuva hano.
I have to get out of here.	Ngomba kuva hano.
That's fine.	Aba ni.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He would know if he had.	Yari kumenya niba afite.
He didn't even know it now.	Ntabwo yari no kumenya ubu.
But, for now.	Ariko, kuri ubu.

You really have to get it.	Mubyukuri ugomba kubona.
Well, read on.	Nibyiza, gusoma vuba.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.

No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe yabwiye.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
It was outside.	Hanze yari hanze.
Everyone has a car.	Umuntu wese afite imodoka.

You can't do this every week.	Ntushobora kubikora buri cyumweru.
I am so happy to be here.	Nishimiye cyane kuba hano.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Even today, he did not know why.	No muri iki gihe, ntiyari azi impamvu.
There is only one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gusa.
This is not a good idea.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I don't know why, but what I heard is good.	Sinzi impamvu, ariko ibyo numvise ari byiza.
It's a mistake.	Ni amakosa.

He may be really good.	Ashobora kuba mwiza rwose.
Lots of things	Ibintu byinshi
He wanted to say what he said.	Yashakaga kuvuga ibyo yavuze.
All would be well.	Byose byaba byiza.
Do you know the plan?	Waba uzi gahunda?
That was enough for me.	Ibyo byari bihagije kuri njye.
There is not much we can do.	Nta byinshi dushobora gukora.
That was the first thing he saw.	Ni cyo kintu cya mbere yabonye.
Well, it was really good.	Nibyo, byari byiza rwose.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.

That's all we can do.	Ibyo aribyo byose dushobora gukora.
But tell me this.	Ariko mbwira ibi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You don't even have to talk to him.	Ntugomba no kuvugana nawe.
He chose to take the time.	Yahisemo gufata umwanya.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
It was a gift to him.	Byari impano kuri we.
Maybe they know something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo bazi.
And that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Kandi ni amahirwe yaje imbere.
Eating is a problem.	Kurya ni ikibazo.
But it was not good enough.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza bihagije.
This is his advice.	Iyi ni inama ye.
He is here until this week.	Ari hano kugeza muri iki cyumweru.
There is very little time to do something.	Hariho umwanya muto cyane wo gukora ikintu.
But they have simple things.	Ariko bafite ibintu byoroshye.
I thought you were here.	Natekereje ko uri hano.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
You were very young.	Wari muto cyane.
He came here yesterday.	Yaje hano ejo.
Getting a job.	Kubona akazi.
It's me.	Ndi njye.
And he is not the only one who wants it.	Kandi ntabwo ari we wenyine ushaka.
That was enough.	Ibi byari bihagije.
We needed that.	Twari dukeneye ibyo.
I like this swim.	Nkunda iyi koga.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Uzi neza ko ushaka kubikora?
He is ready soon.	Yiteguye vuba aha.
But he could see more.	Ariko yashoboraga kubona byinshi.
He is not a young man.	Ntabwo ari umusore muto.
They had no plans.	Nta gahunda bari bafite.
In that.	Muri ibyo.
Drink this.	Kunywa iki.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
He started to have a good idea.	Yatangiye kugira igitekerezo cyiza.
He just told the truth.	Yavuze ukuri gusa.
I'm not doing well today.	Uyu munsi ntabwo nkora neza.
He is sitting there.	Yicaye aho.
But he was also former.	Ariko na we yahoze.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
Only, he was very far away.	Gusa, yari kure cyane.
I was thinking about this.	Natekerezaga kuri ibi.
You don’t want any of that.	Ntabwo ushaka kimwe muri ibyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Did he see it here?	Yabonye hano?
Everyone wants to win.	Umuntu wese arashaka gutsinda.
That was enough.	Byari bihagije.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I like books.	Nkunda igitabo.
I love his wife very much.	Nkunda umugore we neza.
This was a lot for me.	Ibi byari byinshi kuri njye.
He began to tell the truth.	Yatangiye kuvuga ukuri.
He has to live with her until now.	Agomba kubana na we kugeza ubu.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo.
I really wanted to go.	Nashakaga rwose kujyana.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
Nothing wrong.	Nta kibi.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
I want it all, please.	Ndashaka byose, nyamuneka.
Ninde.	Ninde.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
We have to do the work.	Tugomba gukora akazi.
However, not all.	Ariko, si bose.
I'm sure there is more.	Nzi neza ko hari byinshi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
He saw things no one should do.	Yabonye ibintu nta muntu ugomba gukora.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
She must be at home.	Agomba kuba murugo.
Come on.	Hasi.
I thought she was just a girl.	Natekereje ko ari umukobwa gusa.
It was today.	Yari uyu munsi.
He never did.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora.
But he was not alone.	Ariko ntiyari wenyine.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
I think this will be another good thing for him.	Ntekereza ko ibi bizaba ikindi cyiza kuri we.
It is food for him just as people are food for him.	Ni ibiryo kuri we nkuko abantu ari ibiryo kuri we.
At the time, he had nothing.	Icyo gihe nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hafi ya byose.
I'm not sure if that's what you need.	Sinzi neza niba aribyo ukeneye.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
She now has a son.	Ubu afite umuhungu.
Apparently he was happy with this.	Biragaragara ko yari yishimiye ibi.
And in fact, that was true of him.	Kandi mubyukuri, ibyo byari ukuri kuri we.
I guess he didn't know much.	Ndakeka ko atari azi neza.
He has something.	Afite ikintu.
You don't have to do that.	Ntugomba kubikora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
If possible, e.g.	Niba bishoboka, nka.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
That's my phone.	Iyo ni terefone yanjye.
He is not my son.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu wanjye.
You know who he is.	Uzi uwo ari we.
I did nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nakoze.
Maybe right now.	Ahari kuri ubu.
I want to be a guy.	Ndashaka kuba umusore.
We had the first thing.	Twari dufite ikintu cya mbere.
But he had nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yari afite.
But I don’t want to.	Ariko ntashaka.
He heard nothing.	Ntacyo yumvise.
I needed to talk to him.	Nari nkeneye kuvugana na we.
There is a teacher.	Hariho umwarimu.
The gift looked down.	Impano yarebye hasi.
He said he wanted to talk.	Yavuze ko ashaka kuvuga.
I know a lot.	Nzi byinshi.
He can do anything.	Ashobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
To try	Kugerageza
I want him to go.	Ndashaka ko agenda.
But nothing.	Ariko ntacyo.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, yabonye kugenda.
Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko ni byiza.
That's what you said.	Nibyo wavuze.
It is best to do this before the child leaves.	Nibyiza kubikora mbere yuko umwana agenda.
Luckily for me he used to eat well.	Amahirwe kuri njye ko yakundaga kurya neza.
We are just friends.	Turi inshuti gusa.
You can definitely do that.	Urashobora rwose kubikora.
And they probably have the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
He was not coming.	Ntabwo yari agiye kuza.
Probably something else.	Birashoboka ko ari ikindi kintu.
We have friends.	Dufite inshuti.
.	.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
He just wanted to go home.	Yashakaga gusa gutaha.
He thought he was going to do it.	Yatekereje ko agiye kubikora.
He is.	Niwe.
And he is alone.	Kandi ni wenyine.
He looked frightened.	Yarebye afite ubwoba.
With one of them.	Hamwe na kimwe muri byo.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
He saw that.	Yabonye ko.
He did not know how to get out of the situation.	Ntiyari azi uburyo bwo kuva muri icyo kibazo.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
We have to help.	Tugomba gufasha.
About the same.	Hafi ya kimwe.
Not many, that's for sure.	Ntabwo ari benshi, nibyo rwose.
He had no plans now.	Nta gahunda yari afite ubu.
At that moment he thought of her.	Icyo gihe yatekereje kuri we.
I can't swim.	Ntashobora koga.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
Very bad.	Nabi cyane.
Like	Nka
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
You have seen a lot.	Wabonye byinshi.
He thought another time.	Yatekereje ikindi gihe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He had one son.	Yari afite umuhungu umwe.
I really don't have the means to speak.	Ntabwo rwose mfite uburyo bwo kuvuga.
I am not human.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu.
This is a good time.	Iki ni igihe cyiza.
He was ready to go.	Yari yiteguye kugenda.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, biragaragara ko atari njye.
I had a very nice house.	Nari mfite inzu nziza cyane.
And on top.	Kandi hejuru.
It just seems so difficult for me.	Gusa birasa naho bigoye kuri njye.
It was not a job.	Ntabwo byari akazi.
We have to live together.	Tugomba kubana.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
It's good to play.	Nibyiza gukina.
Not everything.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byose.
He was a good child.	Yari umwana mwiza.
Bottom line.	Hasi hasi.
I was hard.	Nari bigoye.
I feel nothing.	Nta na kimwe numva.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
And that is not a trivial matter.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari ikintu gito.
In school.	Mu ishuri.
You know a lot of people.	Uzi abantu benshi.
He was not ready to do that.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye kubikora.
Probably not. 	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
'	'
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
I mean he was my son.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yari umuhungu wanjye.
Want to know more?	Urashaka kumenya byinshi.
But for him it is not.	Ariko kuri we sibyo.
We have to be.	Tugomba kuba.
You have it all.	Ufite byose.
To no.	Kuri no.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ikintu kimwe rwose.
I hope he does.	Ndizera ko abikora.
No one was in front of him.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari imbere ye.
You can't see this.	Ntushobora kubona ibi.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
But it was something to do.	Ariko byari ikintu cyo gukora.
As a last resort.	Nka ya nyuma.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
I knew it was him.	Nari nzi ko ari we.
My wife did everything.	Umugore wanjye yakoze byose.
I can be anyone.	Nshobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
And you have to.	Kandi ugomba.
One of us had to go.	Umwe muri twe yagombaga kugenda.
He loved many people.	Yakundaga abantu benshi.
And she was so beautiful and so, so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane kandi rwose, mwiza.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
You didn't know you were going to live.	Ntabwo wari uzi ko ugiye kubaho.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He agreed to leave.	Yemeye kugenda.
There is a lot to catch.	Hariho byinshi byo gufata.
I'm sure that is possible.	Nzi neza ko ibyo bishoboka.
He went to the room.	Yagiye mu cyumba.
Who had it.	Ninde wari ufite.
But there is no need to wait.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo gutegereza.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, icyo aricyo cyose.
You can do it here.	Urashobora kubikora hano.
Here, let's.	Hano, reka.
In fact, it was worth the wait.	Mubyukuri, byari byiza gutegereza.
Your hair is beautiful!	Umusatsi wawe ni mwiza!
But there is more to it.	Ariko hariho byinshi kuri byo.
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
But it is something.	Ariko ni ikintu.
Especially if you have a family.	Cyane cyane niba ufite umuryango.
He never said anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze avuga.
He was at school at the time.	Icyo gihe yari ku ishuri.
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
I was a girl.	Nari umukobwa.
He has a family.	Afite umuryango.
This is really good.	Ibi ni byiza rwose.
I don't want any of that.	Sinshaka na kimwe muri ibyo.
It’s not after thinking.	Ntabwo ari nyuma yo gutekereza.
Down and close.	Hasi kandi hafi.
I don't think you want to go into this.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ushaka kujya muri iyi.
The event is a snake.	Ibirori ni ejo.
I was very embarrassed.	Nagize isoni cyane.
He thought that was really possible.	Yibwiraga ko ibyo bishoboka rwose.
I never thought of these two together.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza kuri aba bombi hamwe.
I don't want to stop anything.	Sinshaka guhagarika ikintu na kimwe.
I don't want to know the age.	Sinshaka kumenya imyaka.
The problem is big.	Ikibazo ni kinini.
That's right.	Nukuri.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
You can't tell anyone.	Ntushobora kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese.
But he was not very good.	Ariko ntabwo yari mwiza rwose.
Stop talking.	Reka kuvuga.
We can't do it.	Ntidushobora gukora.
He loved both.	Yakundaga bombi.
But not me.	Ariko si njye.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo.
I'm just happy to be friends.	Nishimiye gusa ko turi inshuti.
Is this true?	Ibi nibyo?
It was true for him.	Byari ukuri kuri we.
It’s a good thing to do.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I don’t want him to go.	Sinshaka ko agenda.
This was a major concern for me.	Ibi byari impungenge cyane kuri njye.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
I can't figure this out.	Sinshobora kumenya iki kibazo.
I'm not really scared or anything.	Ntabwo rwose mfite ubwoba cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
If this is true then this is another issue.	Niba ari ukuri ni ikindi kibazo.
Can't find new friends.	Ntashobora kubona inshuti nshya.
For us.	Kuri twe.
He is not in this house.	Ntabwo ari muri iyi nzu.
The day.	Umunsi.
I am a young man easy to walk.	Ndi umusore byoroshye kugenda.
We are one.	Turi umwe.
It would be nice to have a car again.	Byari byiza kongera kugira imodoka.
I really like this movie.	Nkunda iyi firime cyane.
But then.	Ariko icyo gihe.
You can't wait.	Ntushobora gutegereza.
Why did he have to come?	Kuki yagombaga kuza?
You have to do everything.	Ugomba gukora byose.
That, however, is easy.	Ibyo ariko, nibyo byoroshye.
I know how to do it.	Nzi kubikora.
He told me a lot.	Yambwiye byinshi.
I mean, really smart.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri ubwenge.
He doesn't do much today.	Ntabwo akora byinshi muri iki gihe.
I'm not going.	Ntabwo ngiye.
They have a family.	Bafite umuryango.
Everyone needs to play this.	Umuntu wese akeneye gukina ibi.
But that is not the case now.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo ubu.
I was not sure what to do.	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora.
That's right.	Ibyo ni byo.
I should quit now.	Nkwiye kureka ubu.
I can't figure out how.	Sinshobora kumenya uko.
And that's exactly what you have to do.	Kandi nibyo ugomba gukora.
They would tell me nothing.	Ntacyo bari kumbwira.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
We need more people like him.	Dukeneye abantu benshi nka we.
He seems to have a problem.	Asa nkaho afite ikibazo.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
You don’t have to take anything here.	Ntugomba gufata ikintu hano.
She is so happy to be one.	Yishimiye cyane kuba umwe.
In fact, never on time.	Mubyukuri, nta na rimwe ku gihe.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
And that is true.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri.
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
I mean, it's not the same.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo ari kimwe.
Like him.	Kimwe na we.
I suspect the latter.	Ndakeka cyane aba nyuma.
Very good inside.	Nibyiza cyane imbere.
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
This is very close.	Ibi hafi cyane.
He used to watch movies.	Yakundaga kureba firime.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
I think of normal things.	Ndatekereza ibintu bisanzwe.
And she is a beautiful woman.	Kandi ni umugore mwiza.
And you are that big thing.	Kandi uri icyo kintu kinini.
Nearby.	Hafi aho.
You want, you want, you want !.	Ushaka, ushaka, ushaka!.
That's right here.	Nibyo rwose hano.
Nothing for me here.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri njye hano.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
And he came.	Kandi yaje.
But what he wanted was something else.	Ariko icyo yashakaga ni ikindi kintu.
He is in all of us.	Ari muri twese.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi rwose ni ko byagenze.
If it is difficult you can do something else.	Niba bigoye urashobora gukora ikindi kintu.
But in reality.	Ariko mubyukuri.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
Nothing was wrong.	Ntacyo byari cyo.

I was going to do it.	Nari ngiye kubikora.
It really looks good.	Rwose birasa neza.
At first, he couldn't understand what he was seeing.	Mbere na mbere, ntabwo yashoboraga kumva icyo yabonye.
For him.	Kuri we.
He went a little above her.	Yagiye hejuru gato ye.
No one knew what he was talking about.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi icyo avuga.
I love this house.	Nkunda iyi nzu.
I don't know what you think.	Sinzi icyo utekereza.
But it doesn't look right.	Ariko ntabwo asa neza.
He had said that no one could hear anyone.	Yari yavuze ko nta muntu ushobora kumva umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I think that's exactly what happened.	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo rwose.
He needed time to think.	Yari akeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
He thought we were friends.	Yatekereje ko turi inshuti.
He is not sitting right now.	Ntabwo yicaye kuri ubu.
Absolutely!	Rwose!
Me too.	Nanjye.
I never saw why.	Sinigeze mbona impamvu.
In and out, in and out.	Muri no hanze, muri no hanze.
They have nothing.	Ntacyo bafite.
I don't want to go.	Sinshaka kugenda.
As we are.	Nkuko turi.
My son.	Umuhungu wanjye.
I think that.	Ntekereza ko ibyo.
Only your money, and that's it.	Amafaranga yawe gusa, kandi nibyo.
What do you think.	Icyo utekereza.
But this will be fine.	Ariko ibi bizaba byiza.
At one point, he never felt he wanted to work.	Rimwe, ntiyigeze yumva ashaka gukora.
He realized that he had no problem eating too much.	Yabonye ko nta kibazo yari afite cyo kurya byinshi.
You are my best friend.	Uri inshuti yanjye nziza.
I'm really into it.	Ndi mubyukuri kuri we.
Only wisdom.	Ubwenge gusa.
It would not be good for both of them.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza kuri bombi.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
I knew.	Nari nzi.
You should be too.	Nawe ugomba kuba.
I could never do anything better.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora gukora ikintu cyiza.
I have to do it.	Ngomba kubikora.
To live.	Kubaho.
I never heard him speak.	Sinigeze numva avuga umuntu.
That was enough.	Ibyo byari bihagije.
And the problem.	Kandi ikibazo.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
It’s a lot to think about.	Ni byinshi byo gutekereza.
All is well, in fact.	Byose ni byiza, mubyukuri.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He said it was not good.	Yavuze ko atari byiza.
Quit.	Kureka.
There is truth in truth.	Hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
Or maybe it's just that.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko aribyo rwose.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nawe.
I did a lot.	Nakoze byinshi.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
I thought about it all.	Natekereje kuri byose.
Man is good.	Umuntu ni mwiza.
Well, that was a lot for me.	Nibyo, byari byinshi kuri njye.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
One of them.	Kimwe muri byo.
He did nothing and saw nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze kandi ntacyo yabonye.
If money is not a problem,	Niba amafaranga atari ikibazo,
I need to stop looking back.	Nkeneye guhagarika kureba inyuma.
I don’t want to talk about this.	Sinshaka kuvuga kuri ibi.
You have to give up.	Ugomba kureka.
I know you are.	Nzi ko uri.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
She was his daughter.	Yari umukobwa we.
I didn't know what to think.	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza.
I feel lucky to have had that.	Ndumva mfite amahirwe yo kugira ibyo.
But that’s not easy.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
You can find out why.	Urashobora kubona impamvu.
He tried to figure out what to do.	Yagerageje kumenya icyo gukora.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
I am now in one.	Ubu ndi muri umwe.
He loved this.	Yakundaga ibi.
See, see.	Kubona, kubona.
You have to see this.	Ugomba kubona ibi.
That person, whoever he was, could have been a lot of people.	Uwo muntu, uwo ari we wese, yashoboraga kuba abantu benshi.
No problem with that.	Nta kibazo kuri ibyo.
This movie was great.	Iyi firime yari nziza cyane.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
I enjoyed my time.	Nishimiye umwanya wanjye.
I love how it happened.	Nkunda uko byagenze.
We have the money to do it.	Dufite amafaranga yo kubikora.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
You can learn nothing here.	Ntacyo ushobora kwiga hano.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
That's a long way to go.	Ibyo ni kure cyane yo kugenda.
Where we need to go.	Aho dukeneye kujya.
You didn't get a job.	Ntabwo wabonye akazi.
But he knew everything.	Ariko yari azi byose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
He was actually one of us.	Mubyukuri yari umwe muri twe.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
Coming forward.	Kuza imbere.
But you have to have an idea, an idea.	Ariko ugomba kugira igitekerezo, igitekerezo.
I do not.	Ntabwo nkora.
He was three years old.	Yari afite imyaka itatu.
Why is this?	Kuki ibi aribyo?
He later found out what he needed to know.	Nyuma yaje kumenya ibyo yari akeneye kumenya byose.
But there is one problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kimwe.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
It is not on this.	Ntabwo ari kuri ibi.
The question of knowing everything.	Ikibazo cyo kumenya byose.
You don't have time to read.	Ntabwo ufite umwanya wo gusoma.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Ntabwo nzi neza uburyo bwo gukora ibi.
Not much, obviously.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, biragaragara.
Sometimes, that was very difficult.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibyo byari bigoye cyane.
And it's on your phone.	Kandi iri kuri terefone yawe.
He may not want to know.	Ashobora kuba adashaka kumenya.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
But, not really.	Ariko, ntabwo mubyukuri.
I was drinking.	Nari ndimo kunywa.
We are on top.	Turi hejuru.
It may have been good, but he didn't really want to go.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza, ariko mubyukuri ntiyashakaga ko agenda.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
I knew what he liked.	Nari nzi icyo akunda.
No one could walk.	Numuntu uwo ari we wese ntabwo yashoboraga kugenda.
Little boy	Umuhungu muto.
I like to do it, really.	Nkunda kubikora, mubyukuri.
But it was so beautiful.	Ariko yari mwiza cyane.
This, however, is good.	Ibi ariko ni byiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
All the time, just this one time.	Igihe cyose, gusa iki gihe kimwe.
He told me that.	Yambwiye ibyo.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Not that he ever did it.	Ntabwo ari uko yigeze abikora.
They are absolutely scared.	Bafite ubwoba rwose.
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
I love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa.
But that is a good thing.	Ariko icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
We have work to do.	Dufite akazi ko gukora.
He told me something.	Yambwiye ikintu.
We were good friends.	Twari inshuti nziza.
It was not where he should be.	Ntiyari aho agomba kuba.
He knew why he didn't have one.	Yari azi impamvu atari afite.
I see myself doing the same thing.	Njye mbona nkora ikintu kimwe.
Very good and good to buy.	Byiza cyane kandi byiza kugura.
He wants to talk.	Arashaka kuvuga.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ahari.
After watching the movie.	Nyuma yo kureba firime.
His money was gone.	Amafaranga ye yari yagiye.
I do what he never did.	Nkora ibyo atigeze akora.
Today, that's right.	Uyu munsi, nibyo.
That morning at that time, and this morning.	Icyo gitondo icyo gihe, kandi muri iki gitondo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Or whatever.	Cyangwa ibyo aribyo byose.
He is a good dog.	Ni imbwa nziza.
Stop waiting to feel good.	Reka gutegereza kumva ko ari mwiza.
We have to study hard.	Tugomba kwiga cyane.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Opinion.	Igitekerezo.
He wants to talk.	Ashaka kuvuga.
I was looking for something.	Nashakaga ikintu.
However, it is not good.	Ariko, ntabwo ari byiza.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
He began to see the problem.	Yatangiye kubona ikibazo.
Just playing bad.	Gusa gukina nabi.
Or a day.	Cyangwa umunsi.
It was not easy for him.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye kuri we.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
Time.	Igihe.
Only.	Gusa.
Maybe you should.	Birashoboka ko ugomba.
This is my guy.	Uyu ni umusore wanjye.
We have to win.	Tugomba gutsinda.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
I want to leave here.	Ndashaka kuva hano.
All alone.	Byose wenyine.
I was just a friend.	Nari inshuti gusa.
He could see a girl.	Yashoboraga kubona umukobwa.
You don't know what it is.	Ntabwo uzi icyo aricyo.
It's good at home and at school.	Nibyiza murugo no mwishuri.
Uri.	Uri.
Probably not at all.	Birashoboka ko atari na rimwe.
I always have.	Buri gihe mfite.
I'm not working.	Ntabwo ndimo gukora akazi.
He loves to play.	Akunda gukina.
It's too soon.	Ni vuba cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He is on top.	Ari hejuru.
He heard nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yumvise.
But he had, and he will do it tomorrow.	Ariko yari afite, kandi ejo azabikora.
He needs to go fast.	Akeneye kugenda vuba.
I was a bad boy.	Nari umuhungu mubi.
We really didn’t have that.	Ntabwo rwose twari dufite.
But it is not my fault.	Ariko ntabwo ari amakosa yanjye.
In fact, this is possible.	Mubyukuri, ibi birashoboka.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
I am working hard.	Ndimo gukora cyane.
Just one day.	Umunsi umwe gusa.
The money came in a short time.	Amafaranga yaje igihe gito.
In fact, you may be able to help.	Mubyukuri, birashoboka ko nawe ushobora gufasha.
.	.
Did the bus come today?	Bisi yaje uyu munsi?
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
I think you deserve more.	Ntekereza ko ukwiye byinshi.
That's if he needs help.	Nibyo niba ashaka ubufasha.
At the time, he meant.	Icyo gihe, yashakaga kuvuga.
You were a boy.	Wari umuhungu.
You don't know what else to do here.	Ntabwo uzi neza ikindi gukora hano.
He was still out.	Yari akiri hanze.
Is it possible?	Birashoboka?
He should not have lived.	Ntiyari akwiye kubaho.
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza.
.	.
This is not difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye.
I really know the family.	Nzi umuryango rwose.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
You have time.	Ufite igihe.
As usual	Nkuko byari bisanzwe.
I thought a lot.	Natekereje cyane.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
Something he heard outside.	Hari ikintu yumvise hanze.
Anyone could see where.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kureba aho.
I didn't have time to do that.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kubikora.
When do you want	Urashaka ryari?
I saw the same.	Nabonye kimwe.
He is.	Ni we.
And it was a thing.	Kandi byari ibintu.
He looked inside.	Yarebye imbere.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I know you have.	Nzi ko ufite.
He absolutely must.	Agomba rwose.
Trying to talk to someone you loved.	Kugerageza kuvugana numuntu yakundaga.
But no one knew what to do.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo gukora.
The question is, why, and why now ?.	Ikibazo niki, kuki, kandi kuki ubu?.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
You can do it yourself if you know how.	Urashobora kubikora wenyine niba uzi uburyo.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
It's good that they're close.	Mugihe ari byiza ko bari hafi.
No attempt.	Nta kugerageza.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
I should have been something.	Nari nkwiye kuba ikintu.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
But here, here's the thing.	Ariko hano, hano hari ikintu.
Or whatever.	Cyangwa icyo aricyo cyose.
I don’t know the idea of ​​doing this.	Ntabwo nzi igitekerezo cyo gukora ibi.
And the boy did it wrong.	Kandi umuhungu yabikoze nabi.
But he was not.	Ariko ntabwo yari.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
It started on the ground.	Yatangiye hasi.
At present this is clearly the case.	Kuri ubu ibi biragaragara ko aribyo.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
The boy looked inside.	Umuhungu yarebye imbere.
Everyone wants something else.	Umuntu wese arashaka ikindi kintu.
Up.	Hejuru.
You can go at that time.	Urashobora kugenda icyo gihe.
With the plan.	Hamwe na gahunda.
It was hard to see much outside.	Byari bigoye kubona byinshi hanze.
There are people in the house.	Mu nzu hari abantu.
I '.	I '.
One thing, however, he knew for sure.	Ikintu kimwe ariko, yari azi neza ko.
I love it now.	Nkunda ubu.
My friend.	Inshuti yanjye.
This, however, is a mistake.	Ibi ariko, ni amakosa.
None of us know.	Nta n'umwe muri twe uzi.
You can see that for movies it is easy.	Urashobora kubona ko kuri firime byoroshye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
Or he will do it.	Cyangwa azabikora.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gusubira inyuma.
I'm not out.	Ntabwo ndi hanze.
He didn't tell me much.	Ntabwo yambwiye byinshi na gato.
I love everyone.	Nkunda abantu bose.
They were both right.	Bombi bari bafite ukuri.
It was my age.	Yari imyaka yanjye.
We are together.	Turi hamwe.
I was so bad.	Nari mubi cyane.
He just did it.	Yabikoze gusa.
I did and it worked.	Nakoze kandi byagenze neza.
One really has to.	Umuntu agomba rwose.
He may even have friends.	Ashobora no kugira inshuti.
He knew they were going to do it.	Yari azi ko bari kubikora.
I know he is not.	Nzi ko atari we.
It was difficult to say exactly what he was thinking.	Byari bigoye kuvuga neza icyo yatekerezaga.
So far so good.	Kuri ubu byagenze neza cyane.
I didn't know you could do this.	Sinari nzi ko ushobora gukora ibi.
He gave the boy.	Yahaye umuhungu.
That's right.	Nukuri.
he says.	avuga.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
They know the work he does.	Bazi akazi yakoze.
My good guy said nothing.	Umusore wanjye mwiza ntacyo yavuze.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
He did not know why he asked.	Ntabwo yari azi impamvu yabajije.
He needed money.	Yari akeneye amafaranga.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
In that case, it is not.	Kuri icyo kibazo, ntabwo aribyo.
He is not a good person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mwiza.
To me nothing.	Kuri njye ntacyo.
You can do it alone.	Urashobora gukora wenyine.
There is a chance here.	Hano hari amahirwe.
He said it was easy.	Yavuze ko byoroshye.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
I don't want to stay here.	Sinshaka kuguma hano.
He looked good in it.	Yarebye neza muri yo.
I can't say for a long time.	Sinshobora kuvuga igihe kirekire.
He had no idea.	Nta kintu na kimwe yatekereje.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
He was sure he was.	Yari azi neza ko ari we.
No reason at all.	Nta mpamvu rwose.
You were behind.	Wari inyuma.
We all have to work hard.	Twese tugomba gukora cyane.
It would be nice to help someone.	Byaba byiza gufasha umuntu.
I can't take it now.	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ubu.
It's just an idea.	Ni igitekerezo gusa.
This is definitely not the case.	Ibi rwose ntabwo aribyo.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
From the beginning.	Kuva kare.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
You can read it here.	Urashobora gusoma hano.
We have no way of knowing.	Ntabwo dufite uburyo bwo kumenya.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
Can you help ?.	Urashobora gufasha?.
He is smart.	Afite ubwenge.
This would be great.	Ibi byari kuba byiza.
I need you too.	Ninjye ukeneye.
He was still in prison.	Yari akiri muri gereza.
This is all.	Iyi ni ya byose.
I really don't need this.	Ntabwo rwose nkeneye ibi.
I don't want to talk to you	Sinshaka kuvugana nawe.
I have problems here.	Mfite ibibazo hano.
I have to work fast.	Ngomba gukora vuba.
But he was in it too.	Ariko na we yari muri we.
I'm going to talk to you well.	Ngiye kuvugana nawe neza.
He was behind me.	Yari inyuma yanjye.
It was good to go back.	Byari byiza gusubira inyuma.
I didn't want to stay in the house.	Sinifuzaga kuguma mu nzu.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You should have heard him say that.	Wari ukwiye kumva ibyo avuga.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I'm not a girl.	Ntabwo ndi umukobwa.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe.
She wanted to be with him tonight.	Yashakaga kubana na we muri iri joro.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
But that was it.	Ariko ibyo byari.
He hadn't thought he could be here.	Ntabwo yari yatekereje ko ashobora kuba hano.
He was a man of faith.	Yari umuntu ufite kwizera.
For one of us.	Kuri umwe muri twe.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
The reason was good.	Impamvu yari nziza.
You know you want to.	Uzi ko ushaka.
But he never said much.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze avuga byinshi.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
He said where he was going.	Yavuze aho agenda.
You can learn something.	Urashobora kwiga ikintu.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
But there is probably more to it.	Ariko birashoboka ko hari byinshi kuri byo.
Not just people like me.	Ntabwo abantu nkanjye gusa.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
He did it well.	Yabikoze neza.
That's exactly what happened to me.	Nibyo rwose kuri njye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Where he was.	Aho yari ari.
I have a new plan now.	Ndi gahunda nshya ubu.
I am lucky for him.	Mfite amahirwe kuri we.
This is not a problem.	Iki ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
Nothing here, nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe hano, nta kintu.
I guess it was.	Ndakeka yuko byari.
I wanted to feel nothing.	Nashakaga kumva ntacyo.
I know what to do.	Nzi icyo gukora.
Whatever it is.	Byose niba aribyo.
I have a child at home.	Mfite umwana murugo.
He found the truth about her.	Yabonye ukuri kuri we.
I know a guy.	Nzi umusore.
They knew what to do.	Bari bazi icyo gukora.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
He tried, but he was here before.	Yagerageje, ariko yari hano mbere.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
Not possible here.	Ntabwo bishoboka hano.
Stop that.	Reka ibyo.
We have to learn to live together.	Tugomba kwiga kubana.
He must be on time.	Agomba kuba ku gihe.
I can't do this.	Sinshobora gukora ibi.
And whatever it was, everything would be fine.	Kandi ibyo aribyo byose, ibintu byose byari kuba byiza.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
It was a problem.	Byari ikibazo.
You don't have to do anything.	Ntugomba gukora ikintu.
The big one.	Kinini na.
You can have any woman you want.	Urashobora kugira umugore uwo ari we wese ushaka.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane ko ahari.
I don't know how to try.	Sinzi uburyo bwo kugerageza.
There is.	Hariho.
Getting better from there.	Kubona neza kuva aho.
That's not difficult.	Ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
Everyone is film on film, film on film.	Umuntu wese ni firime kuri firime, firime muri firime.
I was very young.	Nari muto cyane.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
Beautiful house.	Inzu nziza.
He is just his friend.	Gusa ni inshuti ye.
You should have gone with him.	Wari ukwiye kujyana na we.
We have to.	Tugomba.
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
They know where to go.	Bazi aho tugomba kujya.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
He was just a young man.	Yari umusore gusa.
And he didn't know why.	Kandi ntiyari azi impamvu.
Just friends at home.	Gusa inshuti murugo.
That's good!	Nibyiza!.
But he was.	Ariko yari we.
I find it very good.	Njye mbona ari byiza cyane.
She was still a woman.	Yari akiri umugore.
It was not good for him.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri we.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
He knew exactly what to expect.	Yari azi neza icyo agomba gutegereza.
But it's too early.	Ariko ni kare.
I can’t think of them all.	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri bose.
Things like.	Ibintu nka.
That was me being the worst.	Uwo yari njye mubi cyane.
It will be difficult for a long time.	Bizaba bigoye igihe kirekire.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
That was probably the time he was gone.	Ibyo birashoboka ko iki gihe yari yagiye.
Here, one should not try to think, one must understand.	Hano, umuntu ntagomba kugerageza gutekereza, agomba kumva.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kujyana.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
There is just something else.	Gusa hariho ikindi kintu.
It hasn't been long.	Ntabwo yamaze igihe kinini.
You can stay where you need to be.	Urashobora kuguma aho igihe cyose ukeneye.
Big this time.	Kinini iki gihe.
You want something good.	Urashaka ikintu cyiza.
It was good to eat.	Byari byiza kurya.
It's a privilege, however.	Ni amahirwe, ariko.
Very good book.	Igitabo cyiza cyane.
I have money.	Mfite amafaranga.
Homecoming time.	Igihe cyo gutaha.
He said he was.	Yavuze ko ari.
I'm here to help.	Ndi hano gufasha.
Very bad thing.	Ikintu kibi cyane.
I don't know, anything else.	Sinzi, ikindi kintu.
You can absolutely do it.	Urashobora kubikora rwose.
He thinks a lot.	Yibwira cyane.
Someone I don't know.	Umuntu ntazi.
You have	Ufite.
It's good to eat.	Nibyiza kurya.
It looks exactly right.	Birasa neza neza.
It was above him.	Byari hejuru ye.
What we have is true.	Ibyo dufite ni ukuri.
Apparently his father had a way.	Biragaragara ko se yari afite uburyo.
His money was too much.	Amafaranga ye yari menshi cyane.
You don’t have to walk alone.	Ntugomba kugenda wenyine.
I don't think it would be good.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko yari kuba mwiza.
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
The problem is not that time.	Ikibazo ntabwo aricyo gihe.
But he has to try.	Ariko agomba kugerageza.
She says she loves her son.	Avuga ko akunda umuhungu we.
No big deal here.	Nta kibazo kinini hano.
There is so much to learn.	Hariho byinshi tugomba kwiga.
Everyone needs a good friend.	Umuntu wese akeneye inshuti nziza.
But that's not what he wants to hear.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo ashaka kumva.
He went back.	Yagiye inyuma.
But it is not the same.	Ariko ntabwo ari kimwe.
Just one.	Kimwe gusa.
I think you need time alone.	Ndatekereza ko ukeneye umwanya wenyine.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
Or maybe even earlier.	Cyangwa birashoboka mbere.
I have never done anything alone.	Ntacyo nigeze nkora wenyine.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
He would not exist.	Ntabwo yari kubaho.
It's the first day.	Ni umunsi wa mbere.
It's one of those.	Ni kimwe muri ibyo.
He told me to stop.	Yambwiye guhagarika.
But here we were.	Ariko hano twari.
Someone was at home.	Umuntu yari murugo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
He was right, too.	Na we yari afite ukuri.
You need time to think.	Ukeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
I didn't see it either.	Nanjye sinigeze mbona.
Or maybe work inside,	Cyangwa birashoboka gukora imbere imbere,
Things were simple.	Ibintu byari byoroshye.
She was still beautiful.	Yari akiri mwiza.
But he was ready.	Ariko yari yiteguye.
I know this would be great and good.	Nzi ko ibi byaba byiza cyane kandi neza.
Swimming before eating is a good idea.	Kugira koga mbere yo kurya ni igitekerezo cyiza.
He once told me he liked to swim.	Igihe kimwe yambwiye ko akunda koga.
I knew everything.	Nari nzi byose.
You are everyone's father.	Uri se wa buri wese.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
The big question is.	Ikibazo kinini ni iki.
She had hair.	Yari afite umusatsi.
I saw that.	Nabonye ibyo.
He has done it before and he can do it again.	Yabikoze mbere kandi arashobora kongera kubikora.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
The child needs to learn to speak.	Umwana akeneye kwiga kuvuga.
We have what we need here.	Dufite ibyo dukeneye hano.
Take a good look.	Kureba neza.
This is exactly what you buy.	Iyi nukuri kugura.
I don't believe it's bad.	Ntabwo nizera ko ari mubi.
He said he was really good.	Yavuze ko yari mwiza rwose.
You do this.	Ukora ibi.
I think you saw it for the first time.	Ntekereza ko wabonye bwa mbere.
He saw something.	Yabonye ikintu.
Anyway, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo yashoboraga kumenya byinshi kuri byo.
He saw that he was scared.	Yabonye ko yari afite ubwoba.
I think I'm the only one.	Ntekereza ko ari njye wenyine.
It's not a mistake or anything.	Ntabwo ari amakosa cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
You had a bad day.	Wari ufite umunsi mubi.
All you need is a good teacher.	Ukeneye gusa umwarimu mwiza.
I didn't do it at all.	Ntabwo nakoze na gato.
But he knew in that look that he had failed.	Ariko yari azi ko agomba kugerageza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
He is inside of her.	Ari imbere muri we.
I think he meant it.	Ndatekereza ko yashakaga kuvuga ko atari we.
He didn't want to do it.	Ntabwo yashakaga kubikora.
He had to, or could not.	Yagombaga, cyangwa ntashobora gukora.
We are good friends now.	Ubu turi inshuti nziza.
I don't want him either.	Sinshaka na we.
I'm not here to be friends with anyone.	Ntabwo ndi hano kuba inshuti numuntu uwo ari we wese.
Nothing too bad.	Nta na kimwe kibi cyane.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
He has many friends.	Afite inshuti nyinshi.
It was not on his agenda.	Ntabwo byari muri gahunda ye.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
They are in me.	Bari muri njye.
I do a lot.	Nkora byinshi.
It would be better not to do it.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza kutabikora.
I just wanted something to eat.	Nashakaga gusa icyo kurya.
They were close.	Bari hafi.
I hope he does.	Mfite kwizera ko azabikora.
I know what you're going to say.	Nzi icyo ugiye kuvuga.
I think a little.	Ntekereza gato.
I knew what he was going to do.	Nari nzi icyo yari gukora.
In fact we are.	Mubyukuri turi.
And they were many.	Kandi bari benshi.
He could have been here.	Yashoboraga kuba hano.
The same was true of his father.	Ni ko byagenze no kuri se.
He had no way of knowing when he was here.	Ntabwo yari afite uburyo bwo kumenya igihe yari amaze hano.
I wanted to win.	Nashakaga gutsinda.
If it had been so easy, everyone would have done it.	Niba byari byoroshye rwose, abantu bose bari kubikora.
He wanted what he wanted.	Yashakaga icyo yashakaga.
You have to learn to go backwards.	Ugomba kwiga gusubira inyuma.
I don't know if that is possible.	Sinzi niba ibyo bishoboka.
There wasn't much he could do about it.	Nta kintu kinini yashoboraga gukora kuri ibi.
No one said.	Nta muntu wavuze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's clear.	Biragaragara neza.
You were one.	Wari umwe.
We don’t have to think too far.	Ntabwo tugomba gutekereza kure cyane.
Good stuff, good stuff.	Ibintu byiza, byiza.
One day he wanted to be a teacher.	Umunsi umwe yashakaga kuba umwarimu.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
We are all one family.	Twese turi umuryango umwe.
This is very likely.	Ibi birashoboka cyane.
He tried to see.	Yagerageje kubona.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko abikora.
You know my wife.	Uzi umugore wanjye.
Until recently.	Kugeza vuba aha.
The girl thought she was beautiful.	Umukobwa yibwiraga ko ari mwiza.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
I really enjoy the job.	Nishimiye cyane akazi.
You can also just walk.	Urashobora no kugenda gusa.
I think it's really good to look at.	Ntekereza ko rwose ari byiza kureba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
Very much like me	Nkanjye cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He loved to watch.	Yakundaga kureba.
I wanted to see my family again.	Nashakaga kongera kubona umuryango wanjye.
He doesn't really know how to do it.	Ntabwo azi rwose uburyo bwo kubikora.
Both were just children.	Bombi bari abana gusa.
Before he could do that, he was on his side.	Mbere yuko agira icyo akora, yari kuri we.
He was bad.	Yari mubi mubi.
Nothing.	Ntacyo ari cyo.
He has problems.	Afite ibibazo.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
Good tonight.	Nibyiza kuri iri joro.
I can have a girl.	Nshobora kugira umukobwa.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
That movie is not very good.	Iyo firime ntabwo ari nziza cyane.
The boy was a boy, and everything was fine.	Umwana yari umuhungu, kandi byose byari byiza.
But, here we are.	Ariko, hano turi.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, we kundusha.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
He started problems.	Yatangiye ibibazo.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
But he had to do what he saw.	Ariko yagombaga gukora ibyo yabonye.
I am not a player.	Ntabwo ndi umukinnyi.
It's not over.	Ntabwo ari hejuru.
He doesn't have much.	Nta byinshi afite.
The truth.	Ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I just need to know if it would be better in the short term.	Gusa nkeneye kumenya niba byaba byiza mugihe gito.
We don't need it now.	Ntabwo dukeneye ubu.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
No one had.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite.
He knows that.	Azi uko.
You can stay with us tonight.	Urashobora kuguma hamwe natwe muri iri joro.
Almost but not.	Hafi ariko sibyo.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
We have to wait for the bus.	Tugomba gutegereza bisi.
He was a man of time.	Yari umuntu ukunda umwanya.
It was a great time.	Wari umwanya mwiza.
That's what he does here.	Nibyo akora hano.
You don't have to tell anyone.	Ntugomba kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He should have done more.	Yari akwiye gukora ibintu byinshi.
My wife is not.	Umugore wanjye sibyo.
He wants to go back.	Arashaka gusubira inyuma.
He didn't have time to do it.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo kubikora.
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
It's too much.	Ni byinshi cyane.
He can be anyone.	Ashobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I want more.	Ndashaka byinshi.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I can't go back.	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma.
Absolutely.	Ari rwose.
He knows what he's doing.	Azi ibyo akora.
It is for every house.	Ni kuri buri nzu.
Each of us.	Buri wese muri twe.
We! 	We!
'he said.	' yavuze.
He probably has none.	Birashoboka ko nta na kimwe afite.
This one does the job.	Uyu akora akazi.
Well, not always.	Nibyiza, ntabwo buri gihe.
We have to see things as they are.	Tugomba kubona ibintu uko bizaba.
Early in the day	Umunsi kare.
He is one.	Ni umwe.
He couldn't help but think, when he was still.	Ntabwo yashoboraga gutekereza gusa, igihe yari akiri.
He was just a child.	Yari umwana gusa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I'm on everything.	Ndi kuri byose.
I just did wrong.	Gusa nakoze nabi.
I don't know how to do it.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo bwo kubikora.
Something I did.	Hari ikintu nakoze.
There are many things here.	Hano hari ibintu byinshi.
I know where he went.	Nzi aho yagiye.
People were scared.	Abantu bari bafite ubwoba.
I know that is true.	Nzi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
I want to see what the girl knows.	Ndashaka kureba icyo umukobwa azi.
This is definitely a big deal.	Ibi rwose ni ikintu kinini.
I was looking for my daughter.	Nashakaga umukobwa wanjye.
He knew where he was.	Yari azi aho ari.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
My whole family.	Umuryango wanjye wose.
I know they have a lot to learn.	Nzi ko bafite byinshi byo kwiga.
Now more than ever.	Ubu kuruta ikindi gihe cyose.
Good friends, good friends.	Inshuti nziza, nziza.
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.
No one in this world can live without it.	Nta muntu n'umwe kuri iyi si ushobora kubaho adafite.
That was difficult for me.	Ibyo byari bigoye kuri njye.
If he did, he would do it.	Iyo abikora, yari gukora.
Only us.	Gusa natwe.
It's not a big deal, to me.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini, kuri njye.
I love how it happened.	Nkunda uko byagenze.
I wanted more, but.	Nashakaga byinshi, ariko.
I like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo.
That’s good advice.	Iyo ni inama nziza.
Not here, obviously.	Ntabwo ari hano, biragaragara.
And the little thing was.	Kandi ikintu gito yari.
I just need to talk to someone.	Nkeneye gusa kuvugana numuntu.
I just don't know what to do.	Gusa sinzi icyo gukora.
I thought he was doing everything.	Natekereje ko arimo akora ibintu byose.
That's right, so far.	Nibyo, kugeza ubu.
In fact, it's a good time.	Mubyukuri, ni igihe cyiza.
In time.	Mugihe.
He got what he wanted.	Yabonye icyo yashakaga.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
He needed a job.	Yari akeneye akazi.
That's right.	Nukuri.
In fact, you can do it now.	Mubyukuri, urashobora kubikora nonaha.
Maybe your family ?.	Ahari umuryango wawe?.
And we need that.	Kandi dukeneye ibyo.
Any idea how to do this.	Igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose uburyo bwo gukora ibi.
In that.	Muri ibyo.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
He was not sure what he wanted to do.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo yashakaga gukora.
You can't do that at home.	Ntushobora kubikora murugo.
It was hard to catch.	Byari bigoye gufata.
We don’t have a lot of people.	Ntabwo dufite abantu benshi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
Read well.	Gusoma neza.
However, his favorite foods are people.	Ariko, ibiryo akunda cyane ni abantu.
I didn’t want to know if he could do it.	Sinifuzaga kumenya niba ashobora kubikora.
It's a good car.	Ni imodoka nziza.
I didn't want to live.	Sinifuzaga kubaho.
You know you have a day.	Uzi ko ufite umunsi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I need to do something else.	Nkeneye gukora ikindi.
We have someone upstairs, upstairs.	Dufite umuntu hejuru, hejuru.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's great.	Ibyo byiza cyane.
He went to his room.	Yagiye mu cyumba cye.
I was a child at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umwana.
Ninde.	Ninde.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.
He can drive.	Arashobora gutwara.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari amakosa.
However, this is not always the case.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo buri gihe ari ukuri mubyukuri.
He had to return to work, he said.	Yagombaga gusubira ku kazi, yavuze.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
He was a good person, and he was my friend.	Yari umuntu mwiza, kandi yari inshuti yanjye.
He did not expect to see much.	Ntabwo yari yiteze kubona byinshi.
Well, not today.	Nibyo, ntabwo uyu munsi.
It's not right here.	Ntabwo ari hano neza.
I saw this, this morning.	Nabonye ibi, muri iki gitondo.
Really good things to say.	Mubyukuri ibintu byiza byo kuvuga.
I can do it easily.	Nshobora kubikora byoroshye.
But he chose to stay.	Ariko yahisemo kuguma.
I needed a plan.	Nari nkeneye gahunda.
That's what he looked like.	Ni cyo yasaga.
It's home.	Ni murugo.
You can't have that.	Ntushobora kugira ibyo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
He asked to know what had happened.	Yasabye kumenya uko byagenze.
I am here alone.	Ndi hano wenyine.
I was always scared when he was alone.	Nari mfite ubwoba igihe cyose iyo ari we wenyine.
I saw that before.	Nabonye iyo mbere.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He had said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yabwiye.
He knew what he was thinking.	Yari azi icyo atekereza.
No one can walk.	Nta muntu ushobora kugenda.
I need to go back to school.	Nkeneye gusubira ku ishuri.
I have to play.	Ngomba gukina.
If that's what you want.	Niba aribyo ushaka.
He was not sitting.	Ntiyari yicaye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And in fact, it is.	Kandi mubyukuri, nibyo.
I can't wait.	Sinshobora gutegereza.
He may even be here.	Ashobora no kuba hano.
That seems to be true, but it is not.	Ibyo birasa nkaho ari ukuri, ariko sibyo.
I need to stop talking.	Nkeneye guhagarika kuvuga.
You have to do it first.	Ugomba kubikora bwa mbere.
One position was available.	Umwanya umwe yari ahari.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He didn’t do much of it.	Ntabwo yakoze ikintu kinini muri byo.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
He was bad.	Ni we wari mubi.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
It's good to be back.	Nibyiza gusubira.
One of the many.	Umwe muri benshi.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko bazi ikintu atazi.
That's what we need to live.	Nibyo dukeneye kubaho.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, byiza ko ari hano.
You are a girl.	Uri umukobwa.
I'm not a bad boy.	Ntabwo ndi umuhungu mubi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi cyane.
There is only food here.	Hano hari ibiryo gusa.
He says he really does, though.	Avuga ko mubyukuri afite ariko.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I don't know much about him.	Ntabwo nzi byinshi kuri we.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo yahisemo wenyine.
I can't have this.	Ntabwo nshobora kugira ibi.
Really good stuff.	Mubyukuri, ibintu byiza rwose.
He can't say the time.	Ntashobora kuvuga igihe.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I was really lucky.	Nagize amahirwe rwose.
He knew he was close.	Yari azi ko ari hafi.
He told me he was scared.	Yambwiye ko afite ubwoba.
I saw things.	Nabonye ibintu.
We don't need money.	Ntabwo dukeneye amafaranga.
He did not know how long he had been.	Ntiyari azi igihe yamaze.
I am something else.	Ndi ikindi kintu.
That's not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije muri ibyo.
I guess so.	Ndakeka yuko.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
Recently we also have a lot to say.	Vuba aha kandi dufite byinshi byo kuvuga.
She became my favorite friend.	Yaje kuba inshuti yanjye nkunda.
Is there another problem?	Hari ikindi kibazo?
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe na kimwe.
He said nothing about what he saw.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze ku byo yabonye.
Not at all, not at all.	Ntabwo ari na rimwe, nta na hamwe.
He is walking and thinking fast and fast.	Arimo kugenda kandi atekereza vuba kandi vuba.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka, reka kuvuga mugihe cyo gukora.
In it he speaks.	Muri yo avuga.
It's not scary.	Ntabwo ari ubwoba.
It is not a car.	Ntabwo ari imodoka.
when.	ryari.
You could say that this is not good.	Urashobora kuvuga ko ibyo atari byiza.
Leave it for a while.	Kureka igihe gito.
I heard all that.	Ibyo byose numvise.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
Same with you.	Kimwe nawe.
I can't say the time.	Sinshobora kuvuga igihe.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I want to be with you.	Ndashaka kubana nawe.
I'm going to read a book too.	Nanjye ngiye gusoma igitabo.
Everything was outside.	Ibintu byose bari hanze.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
I made a lot of mistakes.	Nakoze amakosa menshi.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
It was a lot of money.	Byari amafaranga menshi cyane.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He was not behind.	Ntiyari inyuma.
You are not sure what you are talking about.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo urimo kuvuga.
He does nothing.	Ntacyo akora.
From top to bottom.	Kuva hejuru kugeza hasi.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
It was not on schedule.	Ntabwo byari muri gahunda.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko aribyo.
We just have to.	Tugomba gusa.
I'm glad it happened.	Nishimiye ko byagenze.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
I can do nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora.
And that would really be a problem.	Kandi ibyo rwose byari kuba ikibazo.
Where were we	Twari he?
Sometimes, you just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Rimwe na rimwe, ugomba gusa kugenda.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
She likes to go swimming.	Akunda kujya koga.
You don't have to.	Ntugomba.
He chose to go back to school.	Yahisemo gusubira ku ishuri.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
I got the money.	Nabonye amafaranga.
In front of him.	Imbere ye.
Good question!	Ikibazo cyiza!
I'm not normal.	Ntabwo rwose ndi bisanzwe.
There is something he is saying right.	Hariho ikintu avuga neza.
He knew what to expect now.	Yari azi icyo agomba gutegereza ubu.
But that is possible.	Ariko ibyo birashoboka.
One cannot just buy a job.	Umuntu ntashobora kugura akazi gusa.
I heard nothing about this.	Ntacyo numvise kuri ibi.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo.

Today, that is not the case.	Uyu munsi, ntabwo aribyo.
Tell me what you think.	Mbwira icyo utekereza.
He has made the right choice ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe yahisemo neza.

She came out with the most beautiful hair.	Yaje afite umusatsi mwiza cyane.
He saw that.	Yabonye ibyo.
You have to study.	Ugomba kwiga.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari bigoye kumva.
They are smart and they are here.	Bafite ubwenge kandi bari hano.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
And there is something.	Kandi hariho ikintu.

You are not sure if that is the case.	Ntabwo uzi neza niba aribyo.
Someone needs to do it.	Umuntu akeneye kubikora.
It's okay to just walk.	Nibyiza kugenda gusa.
It seems to be working now.	Birasa nkaho ari gukora ubu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.

But he did not know where he was.	Ariko ntiyari azi aho ari.
But that would be a mistake.	Ariko ibi byaba ari amakosa.
I was a young child.	Nari umwana muto.
I never wanted to.	Sinigeze nshaka.
And I know a lot about it.	Kandi nzi byinshi kuri byo.
This was really good.	Ibi byari byiza rwose.
I did just one thing.	Nagize ikintu kimwe gusa.
Same for everyone, in fact.	Kimwe kuri buri wese, mubyukuri.
I didn't want to be bad.	Sinifuzaga kuba mubi.
And you saw what happened.	Kandi wabonye uko byagenze.

Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You are not sure if that is the case.	Ntabwo uzi neza niba aribyo.
But for no reason.	Ariko nta mpamvu.
I just thought.	Natekereje gusa.
Only.	Gusa.
But enough for me.	Ariko bihagije kuri njye.
I was beautiful.	Nari mwiza.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
He obviously has that.	Biragaragara ko afite ibyo.
You can't stay here.	Ntushobora kuguma hano.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
No one today.	Nta n'umwe muri iki gihe.
We really are.	Turi rwose.
He admitted it was a bad thing to do.	Yemeye ko ari ikintu kibi gukora.
He has to go find problems.	Agomba kujya gushaka ibibazo.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
That is very high.	Ibyo ni hejuru cyane.
It was as if he didn't want to hear the truth.	Byari nkaho adashaka kumva ukuri.
She has to be home by now.	Agomba kuba murugo kugeza ubu.
That's a lot of people.	Ibyo ni abantu benshi cyane.
He has to drive fast.	Agomba gutwara vuba.
It wasn't good, but it was what we needed.	Ntabwo byari byiza, ariko byari ibyo dukeneye.

I have to play well inside.	Ngomba gukina neza imbere.
I need help.	Nkeneye ubufasha.

But right now, what you are doing is very good.	Ariko kuri ubu, ibyo ukora nibyiza cyane.
Then he came to where I am.	Icyo gihe yaje aho ndi.
You can be better than me.	Urashobora kundusha.
None of that.	Nta kintu na kimwe muri ibyo.
You think.	Uratekereza.
I thought it was a good idea.	Natekereje ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
That is a concern.	Ibyo ni impungenge.

It's best if someone agrees to help.	Nibyiza iyo umuntu yemeye gufasha.
To apply	Gusaba.
And it looks good.	Kandi asa neza.
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
We had a son.	Twari dufite umuhungu.
Good family.	Umuryango mwiza.
It was too much for one.	Byari byinshi kuri umwe.
It was really good what he did.	Byari byiza rwose ibyo yakoze.
And he has a lot of money.	Kandi afite amafaranga menshi cyane.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
There is a lot ahead.	Hano hari byinshi imbere.
And that's probably the case.	Kandi birashoboka ko aribyo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
There is probably something about that.	Birashoboka ko hari ikintu kuri ibyo.
In fact, it was not much.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo byari byinshi.
It would be a short time.	Byaba umwanya muto.
But it's good for me.	Ariko ni byiza kuri njye.
I really am not.	Ntabwo rwose ndi.

Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
It's good to play.	Nibyiza gukina.
It will be normal.	Bizaba bisanzwe.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
But that may not be the case for long.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari igihe kirekire.
You are doing something good.	Urimo ukora ikintu cyiza.
But that's not what you think.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo utekereza.
I want to see someone in me again.	Ndashaka kongera kubona umuntu muri njye.

I'm so sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe cyane nibyo urimo.
We are all one.	Twese turi umwe.

It's here.	Ndi hano.
There is something, though.	Hariho ikintu, naho.
I never thought it would be so difficult.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko byari kuba bigoye cyane.

He is not a bad guy.	Ntabwo ari umusore mubi.
He loves everyone.	Akunda abantu bose.
She had been working as a teacher for many years.	Yari amaze imyaka akora akazi ko kuba umwarimu.
I'm happy tonight.	Nishimiye iri joro.
But we need help.	Ariko dukeneye kubona ubufasha.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye gukora.
But he chose.	Ariko yahisemo.
For me, the same thing is true.	Kuri njye, ikintu kimwe ni ukuri.
He is not here, not for him.	Ntabwo ari hano, si kuri we.
He needs.	Akeneye.
However, sometimes this is not easy.	Ariko, rimwe na rimwe ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
I did nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nakoze.

Something he had never heard of.	Hariho ikintu atigeze yumva.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.

Eventually he came home.	Amaherezo yaje gutaha.
He went to do it.	Yagiye kubikora.
There is so much to see.	Hariho ibintu byinshi byo kubona.
They have nothing.	Nta na kimwe bafite.

That's exactly what we have.	Nibyo rwose dufite.
It was when one found out.	Byari mugihe umuntu yamenye.
You are not good, you are bad.	Ntabwo uri mwiza, uri mubi.
The questions were true.	Ibibazo byari ukuri.
He knew both.	Yari azi bombi.
He said.	Yavuze.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
He wants your child.	Ashaka umwana wawe.
One of the things he did.	Kimwe mu byo yakoze.
But nowhere could he go.	Ariko nta na hamwe yashoboraga kujya muri we.
Whether you are going to seek help or not.	Waba ugiye gushaka ubufasha cyangwa.
Especially the girl.	Cyane cyane umukobwa.

You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
We didn't need to do anything.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye gukora ikintu.
The young man was gone.	Umusore yari yagiye.
You don't know everything.	Ntabwo uzi byose.
There are many children.	Hariho abana benshi.

He came very close to doing so.	Yaje hafi cyane kubikora.
He was alone in the room at the time.	Icyo gihe yari wenyine mu cyumba.
He said that was possible.	Yavuze ko ibyo bishoboka.
To read	Gusoma.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
We really can't.	Ntidushobora rwose.
Travel time.	Igihe cyo kugenda.
He looked inside.	Yarebye imbere.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
But there is a way to do this.	Ariko hariho uburyo kuri ibi.
You can stay here or come home or whatever.	Urashobora kuguma hano cyangwa gutaha cyangwa ikindi icyo aricyo cyose.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
I don't know what to say.	Ntazi icyo avuga.

No one can drive.	Nta muntu ushobora gutwara.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Hano nta kintu cyiza hano.
In any case, we must do this again.	Ibyo ari byo byose, tugomba kongera gukora ibi.
Someone I don't know.	Umuntu ntazi.
That he did something wrong.	Ko yakoze ikintu kibi.
I was at work.	Nari ku kazi.
He bought a new house.	Yaguze inzu nshya.
It was good to play.	Byari byiza gukina.
But he does things especially this week.	Ariko akora ibintu cyane cyane muri iki cyumweru.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's the same problem.	Ni ikibazo kimwe.
He said that was a very good idea.	Yavuze ko icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza rwose.
We just have to look.	Tugomba kureba gusa.
But he also looked good.	Ariko na we yasaga neza.
A little down.	Hasi gato.
Tell me where he is.	Mbwira aho ari.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
Only, please.	Gusa, nyamuneka.
No big deal.	Nta kibazo kinini.
They were not friends.	Ntabwo bari inshuti.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga.
I want to swim a lot.	Ndashaka koga cyane.
I never felt he was happy with anything.	Sinigeze numva yishimiye ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
Man, it was great.	Umuntu, byari byiza.
Sometimes, that's exactly what you want.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibyo nibyo ushaka.
Day by day.	Umunsi, umunsi.
We are too.	Natwe turi.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
That's right.	Nibyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kuri twe.
He was not sure what he meant.	Ntiyari azi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
You don't have to talk until you want to talk.	Ntugomba kuvuga kugeza igihe ushaka kuvuga.
She needed help.	Yari akeneye gufasha.
He could see his house in the distance.	Yashoboraga kubona inzu ye kure.
No reading at all.	Nta gusoma byose.
For better or for worse,	Nibyiza cyangwa nabi,
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
That's a very bad idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo kibi cyane.
Was it hard to walk?	Kugenda byari bigoye?
But nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe.
He has the gift of victory.	Afite impano yo gutsinda.
You are a good friend.	Uri inshuti nziza.
He knows you're here.	Azi ko uri hano.
His friend would know what to do.	Inshuti ye yari kumenya icyo agomba gukora.
He wanted to learn everything.	Yashakaga kwiga byose.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri ibyo.
Looks like he needs it.	Birasa nkaho akeneye.
He looked as scared as ever.	Yarebye afite ubwoba nka mbere.
I can't stay away from him.	Sinshobora kuguma kure ye.
And that's fine.	Kandi nibyiza.
He speaks very quickly.	Avuga vuba cyane.
Not now and then.	Ntabwo ari nonaha kandi nyuma.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But it was really good.	Ariko byari byiza rwose.
He is sitting on the bus.	Yicaye muri bisi.
But you can't go back.	Ariko ntushobora gusubira inyuma.
He did really well.	Yakoze neza rwose.
Well, at least you didn't go down without explaining yourself first.	Nibyo, ni iki ushobora kubana.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
You were in it.	Wari urimo.
I can't understand right now.	Ntashobora kumva neza ubu.
This is obviously my favorite.	Ibi biragaragara ko nkunda cyane.
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
He used to walk fast.	Yakundaga kugenda vuba.
I thought he had.	Natekerezaga ko afite.
We have to work now.	Tugomba gukora ubu.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
Being here with you is not a good idea.	Kuba hano hamwe nawe ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
He did not know where he wanted to go.	Ntiyari azi aho yashakaga kujya.
I had it easy enough before.	Nari mfite byoroshye bihagije mbere.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari byose.
I can't go back down.	Sinshobora gusubira hasi.
That's all for me.	Ibyo aribyo byose kuri njye.
I don’t think they were close.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko bari hafi.
I saw your daughter.	Nabonye umukobwa wawe.
I can't live like that.	Sinshobora kubaho gutya.
Or more.	Cyangwa byinshi.
He seemed to love the house.	Yasaga nkaho akunda inzu.
I'm sure that's what you think.	Nzi neza ko aribyo utekereza.
You can't know me either.	Ntushobora kumenya nanjye.
She said she was fine.	Yavuze ko yari mwiza.
We can't see.	Ntidushobora kubona.
You can't get enough.	Ntushobora kubona bihagije.
True and true.	Kuri no kuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
This is a good thing.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
I never believed.	Sinigeze nizera.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
You have to play with what you get.	Ugomba gukina nibyo wabonye.
He needed something good.	Yari akeneye ikintu cyiza.
You have to be good at that time.	Ugomba kuba mwiza icyo gihe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I got it right.	Nabonye neza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kuri byose.
You can try this on your own.	Urashobora kugerageza ibi wenyine.
When something happens.	Mugihe hari ikintu.
It seems.	Birasa.
If anything, it was too much.	Niba hari icyo, byari byinshi cyane.
He really isn't.	Ntabwo rwose arimo.
That you are close to him.	Ko uri hafi ye.
Definitely your favorite.	Rwose ukunda.
No one should go.	Nta muntu ugomba kugenda.
More than ever.	Kurenza buri gihe.
It was hard to believe he was gone.	Byari bigoye kwizera ko yagiye.
It's not hard to see.	Ntabwo bigoye kubona.
Good.	Nziza.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
They were there.	Bari aho.
Stop doing that.	Reka gukora ibyo.
I think there is one small problem.	Ntekereza ko hari ikibazo kimwe gito.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
He should have done it alone.	Yari akwiye kubikora wenyine.
Things are not good.	Ibintu ntabwo ari byiza.
It's your turn.	Ni umwanya wawe.
Or trying to be.	Cyangwa kugerageza kuba.
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
That's right! 	Nibyo!
Because he likes to have a lot of money.	Ni uko akunda kugira amafaranga menshi.
It was about once in the morning.	Byari nka rimwe mu gitondo.
He would not be that person.	Ntabwo yari kuba uwo muntu.
Someone knew money.	Umuntu yari azi amafaranga.
He probably had nothing to do.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo yagombaga gukora.
Where are you?	Bari he?.
We are far away.	Turi kure cyane.
Every morning and every morning.	Buri gitondo na buri gitondo.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
In any case, he always does.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ahora akora.
Just tell me who you want.	Gusa mbwira uwo ushaka.
He told me he could really help.	Yambwiye ko ashobora rwose gufasha.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Down the car.	Hasi imodoka.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
I don’t know if any of us are ready for that.	Sinzi niba umwe muri twe yiteguye kubyo.
Apparently he did it before.	Biragaragara ko yabikoze mbere.
I was thinking this morning.	Natekerezaga kuri iki gitondo.
Nothing good right now.	Ntacyo cyiza ubu.
I mean at all.	Ndashaka kuvuga na gato.
This is true here.	Ibi ni ukuri hano.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
What he tried to do.	Icyo yagerageje gukora.
Dear, why did he just go?	Nyamuneka, kuki yagiye gusa?
I knew he meant it.	Nari nzi ko yashakaga kuvuga.
This is advice for everyone.	Iyi ni inama kuri buri wese.
Playing with him.	Gukina na we.
I mean, do you want to?	Ndashaka kuvuga, urashaka?
She was very happy.	Yishimiye cyane.
I saw a problem.	Nabonye ikibazo.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze avuga.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora.
That was good.	Ibyo byiza byari byiza.
It will just be a long journey.	Gusa bizaba ari kugenda cyane.
You can't study.	Ntushobora kwiga.
And he was really good.	Kandi yari mwiza rwose.
The young man began to study hard.	Umusore yatangiye kwiga cyane.
I really hope it was a good read.	Nizere rwose ko byari byiza gusoma.
He is right about the same thing.	Afite ukuri ku kintu kimwe.
He said it all, exactly.	Yavuze byose, neza na neza.
He gave his son his house.	Yahaye umuhungu we inzu ye.
But really.	Ariko rwose.
For me, it was not good.	Kuri njye, ntabwo byari byiza.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
You wouldn't do that, would you?	Ntabwo wari gukora ibyo, sibyo?
He was there.	Yari ahari.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I'm not good at this.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza kuri ibi.
But nothing wrong.	Ariko nta kibi.
'.	'.
I just wanted to, I wanted any woman, bad.	Nashakaga gusa, nashakaga umugore uwo ari we wese, mubi.
Stop that.	Reka ibyo.
But he knows for sure that it is not good!	Ariko azi neza ko atari byiza!
Her son was beautiful and handsome.	Umuhungu we yari mwiza kandi mwiza.
I need to get a new phone soon.	Ngomba kubona terefone nshya vuba aha.
Only if we can stay in the present.	Gusa niba dushobora kuguma muri iki gihe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, ibi byari byiza, nibyo rwose.
And he was just a boy.	Kandi yari umuhungu gusa.
One has to give up that.	Umuntu agomba kureka ibyo.
She is your daughter.	Ni umukobwa wawe.
He was not sure what he was up to.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo yari yiteguye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
The children are at home today.	Abana bari murugo uyu munsi.
The problem is.	Ikibazo ni iki.
He was not sure he could.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ashobora.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
He can't go back, he knows a lot.	Ntashobora gusubira inyuma, ibyo azi byinshi.
His problem is me.	Ikibazo cye ni njye.
I can definitely.	Nshobora rwose.
I can't believe it.	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
He thought badly.	Yatekereje nabi.
It was not easy, but it was at home.	Ntabwo byoroshye, ariko byari murugo.
I should quit.	Nkwiye kureka.
I have too.	Nanjye mfite.
Nothing.	Ntacyo ari cyo.
And my friend was right.	Kandi inshuti yanjye yari afite ukuri.
So much to see and learn.	Byinshi cyane kubona no kwiga.
He was not happy.	Ntabwo yishimiye.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He knew he was close.	Yari azi ko ari hafi.
He thought it was possible.	Yatekereje ko bishoboka.
There is a problem.	Hariho ikibazo.
And he's just a kid.	Kandi ni umwana gusa.
Working and waiting.	Gukora no gutegereza.
I am a young man.	Ndi umusore.
It’s not just money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga gusa.
Let's have money.	Reka dufite amafaranga.
Something or, or, or.	Ikintu cyangwa, cyangwa, cyangwa.
Really down, but out ?.	Hasi rwose, ariko hanze?.
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
And he was.	Kandi yari.
It was not very far.	Ntiyari kure cyane.
He is going where you are.	Agiye aho uri.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
It hasn't been long before that.	Ntabwo yamaze igihe kinini kuri ibyo.
And that is not good.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
We are not close.	Ntabwo turi hafi.
I wanted to do it tonight.	Nashakaga kubikora iri joro.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
But none of that.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
I did.	Nakoze.
Of course, he looks good.	Ni ukuri, asa neza.
I believe it is true.	Nizera ko ari ukuri.
One.	Umwe.

I need it here.	Ndi hano nkeneye.
I don't want to live again.	Sinshaka kongera kubaho.
Good thing to do.	Ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
He was good enough to say much.	Yari mwiza bihagije kuvuga byinshi.
Any child can learn to swim in a short time.	Umwana wese arashobora kwiga koga mugihe gito.
Maybe too high.	Ahari hejuru cyane.
This is my clothes.	Iyi si imyenda yanjye.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
And you are.	Kandi urimo.
Absolutely that.	Ibyo rwose.
I saw nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nabonye.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
But obviously there is someone at home.	Ariko biragaragara ko murugo hari umuntu.
He probably thought.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje.
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
Is this normal?	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe?
But he did nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yakoze.
He was ready to go.	Yari yiteguye kugenda.
One person, however, was not present.	Umuntu umwe ariko ntiyari ahari.
I’ve noticed that he always does.	Nabonye ko buri gihe akora.
You don't know for sure.	Ntabwo uzi neza.
Over the top.	Kurenza hejuru.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Yari azi neza icyo ashaka.
She is not any woman.	Ntabwo ari umugore uwo ari we wese.
Or you.	Cyangwa wowe.
He wanted to stay.	Yashakaga kuguma.
We may not do this.	Ibi dushobora kutabikora.
But it can't go very fast.	Ariko ntashobora kugenda vuba cyane.
Many.	Benshi.
It is not a thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu.
It's not close.	Ntabwo ari hafi.
The car is great.	Imodoka ni nziza.
You really shouldn’t drink too much.	Ntugomba rwose kunywa cyane.
He looked down, frightened.	Yarebye hasi, afite ubwoba.
He is right.	Arimo avuga neza.
I feel that way.	Ndumva ko aribyo.
I'm not sure if there is anything to see.	Ntabwo nzi neza niba hari icyo kubona.
It's not just here.	Ntabwo ari hano gusa.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
Or maybe earlier.	Cyangwa ahari mbere.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
With us.	Natwe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I should have known better.	Nari nkwiye kumenya neza.
I just want the truth.	Ndashaka ukuri gusa.
The guy looked good.	Umusore yasaga neza.
I can buy this.	Nshobora kugura ibi.
Good dog.	Imbwa nziza.
He was not expecting me.	Ntabwo yari yiteze kuri njye.
They were one.	Bari umwe.
He said it was something he had to do.	Yavuze ko ari ikintu yagombaga gukora.
I didn't know either.	Ntabwo nari nzi bombi.
He was not worried.	Ntiyari afite impungenge.
We must learn to live well.	Tugomba kwiga kubana neza.
He loved that.	Yakundaga ibyo.
And he had a lot to say.	Kandi hari byinshi yashakaga kuvuga.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
That's what you do well.	Nibyo ukora neza.
I always have.	Buri gihe mfite.
And he was still there.	Kandi yari akiri aho.
But he had a chance to think.	Ariko yari afite amahirwe yo gutekereza.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Very good stuff.	Ibintu byiza cyane.
Ninde.	Ninde.
I want to know what it is.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo aricyo.
It was too far.	Yari kure cyane.
You can't go back, you can't go forward.	Ntushobora gusubira inyuma, ntushobora kujya imbere.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
If anything you.	Niba hari ikintu wowe.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
He says it's not a good time now.	Avuga ko ubu atari igihe cyiza.
Please, look away.	Nyamuneka, yarebye kure.
He was a young man.	Yari umuntu akiri muto.
If not, you shouldn't.	Niba atari byo, ntagomba kubikora.
Something high.	Ikintu cyo hejuru.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
Luckily, that.	Afite amahirwe, uwo.
No need to do that here.	Nta mpamvu yo kubikora hano.
I'm a young man who knows that.	Ndi umusore uzi icyo.
I mean he is.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
I'm sure he is.	Nzi neza ko ari we.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, rwose ikibazo cyiza cyo kugira.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta n'umwe ufite.
But it's like.	Ariko ni nka.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
He knew they were here.	Yari azi ko bari hano.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
You never know what you're going to get!	Ntushobora kumenya icyo ugiye kubona!
It's good.	Ndi mwiza.
He knew he could do it alone.	Yari azi ko wenyine ashobora kubikora.
I can't believe she's young.	Sinshobora kwizera ko ari muto.
Yes, there is a car.	Nibyo, hariho imodoka.
I was close to him.	Nari hafi ye.
And it's your movie, that's fine.	Kandi ni firime yawe, nibyiza.
What he hears and thinks.	Ibyo yumva kandi atekereza.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
You have to be above everything from here on out.	Ugomba kuba hejuru ya byose kuva hano muri.
I just never heard of it.	Gusa sinigeze numva.
But it was not easy.	Ntabwo ariko byari byoroshye.
I'm just worried.	Mfite impungenge gusa.
But it would not come.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuza.
He was not well prepared for what he was saying.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye neza icyo avuga.
Can't stop looking.	Ntashobora guhagarika kureba.
But you have to come.	Ariko ugomba kuza.
And he probably has the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
He is here for me.	Ari hano kuri njye.
I'm not good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza.
This is your family.	Uyu ni umuryango wawe.
It was a bad idea.	Byari igitekerezo kibi.
I just didn’t know how or why.	Gusa sinari nzi uburyo cyangwa impamvu.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Yashakaga kuvugana na we gusa.
Everyone had problems.	Umuntu wese yagize ibibazo.
Not good enough.	Ntabwo ari mwiza bihagije.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
The last thing.	Ikintu cya nyuma.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Something to eat.	Ikintu cyo kurya.
I know that.	Nzi ko aribyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
I was just thinking.	Natekerezaga gusa.
It was going to be a lot.	Byari kugenda cyane.
He never mentioned his family.	Ntiyigeze avuga umuryango we.
I have to get everything right.	Ngomba kubona ibintu byose neza.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
And on top.	Kandi hejuru.
Maybe my wife.	Ahari umugore wanjye.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
It is not for him.	Ntabwo ari kuri we.
You think he's a good guy.	Utekereza ko ari umusore mwiza.
You know more.	Uzi byinshi.
You have to go now.	Ugomba kugenda ubu.
The thing is.	Ikintu ni uko.
One had to be lucky.	Umuntu yagombaga kugira amahirwe.
It's a privilege.	Ni amahirwe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Sometimes, the best thing to do is do nothing.	Rimwe na rimwe, ikintu cyiza cyo gukora ntacyo ukora.
You don’t have to walk alone.	Ntugomba kugenda wenyine.
You are not sure what it is.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo aricyo cyose.
There are so many of them here.	Hano hari byinshi muri bose.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
He found the door.	Yabonye umuryango.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
I didn't know what it was.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo.
I didn't see what happened.	Ntabwo nabonye uko byagenze.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
He knows everything.	Azi byose.
His youngest daughter.	Umukobwa we muto.
You need to know where to look.	Ugomba kumenya aho ugomba kureba.
He saw what he did.	Yabonye ibyo yakoze.
My son was right.	Umuhungu wanjye yari afite ukuri.
It is not possible, but it is possible.	Ntabwo bishoboka, ariko birashoboka.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
And nothing for him.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe kuri we.
And that's right.	Kandi ibi ni byo.
He didn't need to look up.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kureba hejuru.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
I believe a lot in me.	Ndizera byinshi muri njye.
The guy did a great job.	Umusore yakoze ikintu cyiza cyane.
He should have come home.	Yari akwiye gutaha.
I don't have to be scared anymore.	Ntabwo ngomba kongera kugira ubwoba.
He saw a lot.	Yabonye byinshi.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
He didn't want to be there.	Ntiyashakaga aho.
He had said nothing.	Nta kintu yari yavuze.
All you have to do is believe.	Ukeneye kwizera gusa.
I haven't seen much of it before.	Sinigeze mbona kimwe kinini, mbere.
In front of me.	Imbere yanjye.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
But he was there.	Ariko yari ahari.
I think you are too.	Ndatekereza ko nawe uri.
I don’t want him to go.	Ntashaka ko agenda.
He is a good boy, he is.	Ni umuhungu mwiza, ni.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
But he had to do more.	Ariko yagombaga gukora byinshi.
He had to move forward.	Yagombaga kujya imbere.
He sits next to me.	Yicaye hafi yanjye.
I don't want to come.	Sinshaka kuza.
Probably not just money.	Birashoboka ko atari amafaranga gusa.
If you have to.	Niba ugomba.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
It was just the truth.	Byari ukuri gusa.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Nothing much to say.	Nta kintu kinini cyo kuvuga.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
Nothing is too small.	Nta kintu na kimwe ari gito cyane.
I have a good family.	Mfite umuryango mwiza.
I was not.	Ntabwo nari.
And there is more to come.	Kandi hariho byinshi byo kuza.
In the end, it's me.	Amaherezo, ni njye.
The job is not too bad.	Akazi ntabwo ari kibi cyane.
Today is.	Uyu munsi urimo.
But I can't see it.	Ariko ntashobora kubona.
You know why.	Uzi impamvu.
And it was close.	Kandi byari hafi.
She is beautiful, but she has nothing.	Ni mwiza rwose, ariko ntacyo afite rwose.
She is scared and worried.	Afite ubwoba kandi afite impungenge.
They are in the same school.	Bari mu ishuri rimwe.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza cyane kubona.
He does nothing good for her.	Ntacyo akora cyiza kuri we.
I don't mean to offend.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga nabi.
I was beautiful.	Nari mwiza.
I don't have many friends.	Ntabwo mfite inshuti nyinshi.
Especially when.	Cyane cyane iyo.
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
It wasn’t much for us to do.	Ntabwo byari byinshi kuri twe gukora.
One last time.	Igihe kimwe cya nyuma.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
Everything is fine so far.	Ibintu byose ni byiza kugeza ubu.
Your favorite actor is currently filming.	Umukinnyi ukunda ubu arimo gukina firime.
Maybe a long time.	Ahari igihe kinini.
I know your wife.	Nzi umugore wawe.
Do you want to buy here?	Urashaka kugura hano?
I need it on top.	Nkeneye hejuru.
I was really scared.	Nari mfite ubwoba rwose.
I guess until the gameplay he did.	Ndakeka kugeza gukina gukina yakoze.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Me too	Njye na we.
He was sitting.	Yari yicaye.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
He looked behind me.	Yarebye inyuma yanjye.
I heard both.	Numvise bombi.
Getting more was a problem.	Kubona byinshi byari ikibazo.
They are friends.	Ni inshuti.
I am one.	Ndi umwe.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
I really needed to.	Nari nkeneye rwose.
What you need.	Icyo ukeneye.
It started with me.	Yatangiye kuri njye.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
I am very bad.	Ndi mubi cyane.
He said he used to play tennis.	Yavuze ko yakundaga gukina tennis.
Like he was a dog.	Nkuko yari imbwa.
Anyone can do simple things.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese arashobora gukora ibintu byoroshye.
In that case,.	Icyo gihe,.
Bose.	Bose.
That they were human.	Ko bari abantu.
Anything.	Ikintu cyose.
Where he was supposed to be, what he was supposed to do.	Aho yagombaga kuba, icyo yagombaga gukora.
He loves to play tennis.	Akunda gukina tennis.
They would probably eat more than usual.	Birashoboka ko bari kurya kuruta uko byari bisanzwe.
You are talking to me.	Urimo kuvugana nanjye.
I have a problem with quitting.	Mfite ikibazo cyo kureka.
He would be ready to work.	Yaba yiteguye gukora.
He had none of it.	Ntabwo yari afite muri we.
He needs to know everything.	Akeneye kumenya byose.
All together	Byose hamwe.
That's not the problem here.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo hano.
The expert said it was.	Umuhanga yavuze ko aribyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
That's a lot!	Ibyo ni byinshi!
It was good to go.	Kugenda byari byiza.
I'm going to work.	Ngiye ku kazi.
He is who you are.	Ni uwo uri we.
To think	Gutekereza.
You have to.	Ugomba.
He looked closely.	Yarebye cyane.
He thought he couldn't be both in the house.	Yatekereje ko ntashobora kuba bombi mu nzu.
I enjoyed playing here.	Nari nishimiye, gukina hano.
He asked for money.	Yasabye amafaranga.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
The whole family.	Umuryango wose.
He was young and beautiful.	Yari muto kandi mwiza.
He just wants to play with me.	Arashaka gukina nanjye gusa.
As hard as it is for me to believe sometimes.	Nkuko bigoye kuri njye kwizera rimwe na rimwe.
Inside him.	Imbere muri we.
We need time here.	Dukeneye umwanya hano.
But things were going very well.	Ariko ibintu byari byiza cyane.
It was here, at home.	Byari hano, murugo.
Most of it was luck.	Byinshi muri byo byari amahirwe.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
She loves her children.	Akunda abana be.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
Everything was fine.	Ibintu byose byari byiza.
I never got the money.	Sinigeze mbona amafaranga.
He thought it would be nice.	Yatekereje ko byari kuba byiza.
At the time, I had a plan.	Icyo gihe nari mfite gahunda.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
I think he never did.	Ntekereza ko atigeze abikora.
He was not human.	Ntiyari umuntu.
That is possible now.	Ibyo birashoboka ubu.
Thirty years earlier, it is possible.	Imyaka mirongo itatu mbere, birashoboka.
He knew it was.	Yari azi ko ari.
He had children.	Yari afite abana.
That is not the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
Who did it? 	Ninde wari wabikoze?
And alone.	Kandi wenyine.
The young man was gone.	Umusore yari yagiye.
There is truth in truth.	Hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
You can't talk for long.	Ntushobora kuvuga igihe kirekire.
It was great here.	Byari byiza hano.
It was a wonderful experience.	Yari ikintu cyiza cyane.
I want to take my wife.	Ndashaka gutwara umugore wanjye.
What do you think about this?	Uratekereza iki kuri iki kibazo?
You can't even do it.	Ntushobora no gukora.
Sometimes, you just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Rimwe na rimwe, ugomba gusubira inyuma.
He did very well.	Yagize neza cyane.
For me.	Kuri njye.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
I have no plans.	Nta gahunda mfite.
But I'm not sure if he can do it.	Ariko ntazi neza niba ashobora kubikora.
He never spoke.	Ntiyigeze avuga.
I know where he may be.	Nzi aho ashobora kuba.
I don't even want to do it.	Sinshaka no kubikora.
He spoke in support of the US Alliance, but said that maintaining some independence was important.	Yavuze neza kuri icyo kibazo.
Everyone knew everything.	Abantu bose bari bazi byose.
That really was it.	Ibyo rwose byari.
There are many of us.	Hariho benshi muri twe.
This was good for me.	Ibi byari byiza kuri njye.
There are simple things we can do.	Hariho ibintu byoroshye dushobora gukora.
This was a good thing for him.	Ibi byari ibintu byiza kuri we.
Much of it actually.	Byinshi mubyukuri.
That's not what we have today.	Ntabwo aribyo dufite uyu munsi.
He must also be here.	Agomba no kuba hano.
I did well in school.	Nakoze neza mu ishuri.
It was good to live.	Byari byiza kubaho.
You want to win.	Urashaka gutsinda.
I have nothing to say.	Ntacyo nshaka kuvuga.
However, this is not easy.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
Many, but not all.	Byinshi, ariko sibyo.
No.	Nta.
He is obviously smart.	Biragaragara ko afite ubwenge.
Something to catch.	Ikintu cyo gufata.
I don't really know.	Sinzi mubyukuri.
I didn't know if it was a good thing or not.	Ntabwo nari nzi niba aricyo kintu cyiza cyangwa atari cyo.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
'she is a very hardworking woman.	'ni umugore ukora cyane.
And, to know when to know when you are ahead.	Kandi, kumenya igihe cyo kumenya igihe uri imbere.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He does this sometimes.	Ibyo abikora rimwe na rimwe.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He had the truth above.	Yari afite ukuri hejuru.
He is a child.	Ni umwana.
I think that's a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari amakosa.
To this day, one was not.	Kuri uyumunsi, umwe ntiyari.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
I'm not sure if this is possible.	Sinzi neza niba ibi bishoboka.
That's the player.	Uwo ni umukinnyi.
But one had to do it.	Ariko umuntu yagombaga kubikora.
It was yesterday, in fact.	Byari ejo, mubyukuri.
I want to go back to school.	Ndashaka gusubira ku ishuri.
Everyone wants money.	Umuntu wese arashaka amafaranga.
I didn't need to.	Sinari nkeneye.
It is not his thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cye.
She loved to read.	Yakundaga cyane gusoma.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He went.	Yagiye.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
Your wife is so beautiful.	Umugore wawe ni mwiza cyane.
He thought he knew what he meant.	Yatekereje ko azi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I hope it has worked well so far.	Nizera ko byagenze neza kugeza vuba aha.
I mean, it's really good.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari byiza rwose.
And you can't do anything.	Kandi ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
This program is very good.	Iyi gahunda ni nziza cyane.
We need to know.	Tugomba kumenya.
For him, all he had was everything.	Kuri we, icyo yari afite ni byose.
This morning	Muri iki gitondo.
Everything he knew, was true.	Ibintu byose, yari azi, byari ukuri.
You just saw the mistake.	Wabonye gusa amakosa.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
No one is down.	Nta muntu uri hasi.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He needs to play.	Akeneye gukina.
You can't get out of that.	Ntushobora kuva muri ibyo.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
I think that's really good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza rwose.
He always has good advice.	Buri gihe agira inama nziza.
You can't have everything.	Ntushobora kugira byose.
If you have a long time.	Niba ufite igihe kirekire.
Beautiful house.	Inzu nziza.
It was a book.	Yari igitabo.
I have to too.	Nanjye ngomba.
It was good and good.	Byari byiza kandi byiza.
I just feel.	Ndumva gusa.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
He really didn't know anything.	Mubyukuri ntacyo yari azi.
For everything.	Kuri byose.
House.	Inzu.
Tomorrow would be a day.	Ejo byari kuba umunsi.
Why do you really love someone?	Kuki ukunda umuntu mubyukuri
And that is good for me.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza kuri njye.
But today is not a good day.	Ariko uyu munsi ntabwo ari umunsi mwiza.
I did this.	Nakoze ibi.
We were all kids at the same time.	Twese twari abana rimwe.
He wanted to come.	Yashakaga kuza.
Waiting was very difficult.	Gutegereza byari bigoye cyane.
He is not anyone.	Ntabwo ari umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
You have to do this.	Ugomba gukora ibi.
There is a small problem.	Hariho ikibazo gito.
Sometimes a lot of cars.	Rimwe na rimwe imodoka nyinshi.
And he.	Na we.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko aribyo.
To.	Kuri.
He looked worried.	Yarebye afite impungenge.
That's a lot.	Nibyo byinshi.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
I have something to do.	Mfite ibyo gukora.
Just tell me what you want.	Gusa mbwira icyo ushaka.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I think we need both.	Ntekereza ko dukeneye bombi.
We have nothing to eat.	Ntacyo dufite cyo kurya.
Living alone.	Kubaho wenyine.
I thought about all that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo byose.
In front of him.	Imbere ye.
I like it here.	Nkunda hano.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
Or maybe a lot of people.	Cyangwa ahari abantu benshi.
You have to take the time.	Ugomba gufata umwanya.
I was a little boy.	Nari umuhungu muto.
He did not know what he was thinking or feeling.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza cyangwa kumva.
That someone was right.	Ko umuntu yari afite ukuri.
In fact, far from it.	Mubyukuri, kure cyane.
You can tell me the truth.	Urashobora kumbwira ukuri.
And that's great.	Kandi nibyiza cyane.
He wants to say more.	Arashaka kuvuga byinshi.
The bus came here.	Bisi yaje hano.
Getting a job.	Kubona akazi.
And when.	Kandi ryari.
That was absolutely true.	Ibyo byari ukuri rwose.
They have nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe bafite.
He will not do it.	Ntabwo azabikora.
He always thinks of ways to help people.	Buri gihe atekereza uburyo bwo gufasha abantu.
But you have to find the right time.	Ariko ugomba kubona igihe neza.
But you can see.	Ariko urashobora kubona.
This is definitely not a problem.	Ibi rwose ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I was good at that.	Nari mwiza kuri ibyo.
I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva.
I feel it.	Ndimo ndumva.
I don't want to hear any more.	Sinshaka kumva ikindi kibazo.
He seemed scared.	Yasaga naho afite ubwoba.
It was outside.	Byari hanze.
Instead of just waiting.	Aho gutegereza gusa.
You want to do the same thing.	Ushaka gukora ikintu kimwe.
He didn't need to talk.	Ntiyari akeneye kuvuga.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
No problem.	Nta kibazo na kimwe.
But that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ariko ibyo nibyiza dushobora gukora nonaha.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
This is very likely.	Ibi birashoboka cyane.
But it was bad enough.	Ariko yari mubi bihagije.
I thought he could play.	Natekerezaga ko ashobora gukina.
He was going.	Yaba agiye.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu.
And he was going to do it.	Kandi yari agiye kubikora.
It's a good thing.	Ni ibintu byiza.
I can't work.	Sinshobora gukora.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
But not you.	Ariko si wowe.
I think things were very difficult.	Ntekereza ko ibintu byari bigoye cyane.
One can say something.	Umuntu arashobora kuvuga ikintu.
None of us can.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ushobora.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You saw.	Wabonye.
It was harder than that.	Byari bigoye kuruta ibyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It’s not hard to see why.	Ntabwo bigoye kubona impamvu.
You have to learn to live.	Ugomba kwiga kubaho.
But he seemed.	Ariko we yasaga naho.
I knew he had to be young.	Nari nzi ko agomba kuba akiri muto.
But me.	Ariko njye.
I'm not sure what to do.	Sinzi neza icyo gukora.
Everyone knows the truth.	Umuntu wese azi ukuri.
Maybe for a while.	Ahari igihe gito.
What is he up to now? 	Ni iki arimo kugeza ubu?
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
He can't go back.	Ntashobora gusubira inyuma.
Being here.	Kuba uri hano.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
If not.	Niba atari byo.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
I finally saw it.	Amaherezo nabonye.
It was simple, but good.	Byari byoroshye, ariko byiza.
But he did not know when he had it.	Ariko ntabwo yari azi igihe yari afite.
It's too low.	Ni munsi cyane.
It can't even exist.	Ntashobora no kubaho.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
It would be nice to be ready.	Byaba byiza yiteguye.
This was his bad day.	Uyu wari umunsi we mubi.
Really good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza rwose.
I'm sure that	Nzi neza ko
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
We need to know what happened.	Tugomba kumenya uko byagenze.
He was not dressed.	Ntabwo yari yambaye.
Making a movie was really good.	Gukora firime byari byiza rwose.
This is recent.	Ibi vuba aha.
You know the time.	Uzi igihe.
He had a job, and it looks like.	Yari afite akazi, kandi asa nkaho.
It was not a mistake.	Ntabwo byari amakosa.
It's not a job.	Ntabwo ari akazi.
I think he is smart.	Ntekereza ko afite ubwenge.
And to think that it was good.	Kandi gutekereza ko byari byiza.
Or it was.	Cyangwa byari.
This was your family.	Uyu wari umuryango wawe.
They have children.	Bafite abana.
It's really good to eat that.	Nibyiza rwose kurya ibyo.
But he did not raise the issue.	Ariko ntiyigeze avuga icyo kibazo.
You can't or can't.	Ntushobora cyangwa ntushobora.
None of this I do.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo nkora.
Or a car.	Cyangwa imodoka.
He is right, too.	Afite ukuri, kandi.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
He was sitting there.	Yari yicaye aho.
I doubt if it is possible.	Ndashidikanya niba bishoboka.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka kuba hano.
Please wait here.	Nyamuneka gutegereza hano.
He used to have problems at school.	Yakundaga kugira ibibazo ku ishuri.
And what he had just said was true.	Kandi ibyo yari amaze kuvuga byari ukuri.
I want to be beautiful.	Ndashaka kuba mwiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's really cool.	Ibyo ni byiza rwose.
I can't do that then.	Sinshobora kubikora icyo gihe.
I am everything.	Ndi byose.
It was on me.	Yari kuri njye.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
He’s going to win, not really.	Agiye gutsinda, ntabwo mubyukuri.
She was so beautiful now.	Yari mwiza cyane ubu.
I had no idea.	Ntacyo natekereje.
But this is good for children.	Ariko ibi nibyiza kubana.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
I want to be early.	Ndashaka kuba kare.
You think it's good.	Uratekereza ko ari mwiza.
It was very easy, this.	Byari byoroshye cyane, ibi.
More to learn, less time.	Byinshi byo kwiga, umwanya muto.
However, so far that is not the case.	Ariko, kugeza ubu ntabwo aribyo.
You don't have to do this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi.
He had problems before.	Yari afite ibibazo mbere.
I was not sure what it was.	Sinari nzi neza icyo aricyo.
he said.	yavuze.
He never wanted to be.	Ntiyigeze yifuza kuba.
We must always ask.	Tugomba gusaba buri gihe.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
Or is it.	Cyangwa ni.
I found nothing good.	Ntacyo nabonye cyiza.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
I now have a house.	Ubu mfite inzu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Good party.	Ibirori byiza.
Maybe even.	Ahari na mbere.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
My whole family is.	Umuryango wanjye wose ni.
No ground.	Nta hasi.
And that was true.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri.
I was not.	Ntabwo nari.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
I'm not sure about everything.	Ntabwo nzi neza kuri byose.
I don't want to come.	Ntashaka kuza.
He can eat.	Arashobora kurya.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
I saw something else.	Nabonye ikindi kintu.
To go	Kugenda.
I don't know this thing.	Ntazi iki kintu.
He saw the film.	Yabonye iyo firime.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I'm afraid that's the problem.	Mfite ubwoba ko aricyo kibazo.
Just waiting for the right opportunity.	Gutegereza gusa amahirwe akwiye.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
One has to know something.	Umuntu agomba kumenya ikintu.
In fact, there is nothing wrong with that.	Mubyukuri, nta kibi, nta kibi.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekereje cyane kuri byo.
But he was worried.	Ariko yari afite impungenge.
Or not.	Cyangwa sibyo.
I'm playing well.	Ndimo gukina neza.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
He does something he wants to do.	Akora ikintu ashaka gukora.
I have to go see things.	Ngomba kujya kureba ibintu.
One time.	Umwanya umwe.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
I wanted that with him.	Nashakaga ibyo hamwe na we.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
It was good to know.	Byari byiza kumenya.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
I did nothing.	Ntacyo nakoze.
He hears.	Yumva.
Someone wanted to know something.	Umuntu yashakaga kumenya ikintu.
I have a lot to say.	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
And he had a lot of good advice.	Kandi yari afite inama nyinshi nziza.
This is likely to be your down time.	Ibi birashoboka ko umwanya wawe wo hasi ushobora kuba.
All or nothing he thinks.	Byose cyangwa ibyo atekereza.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
Do you need help? 	Ukeneye ubufasha?
Her hair was beautiful and organized.	Umusatsi we wari mwiza kandi ufite gahunda.
It was really nice to read.	Byari byiza rwose gusoma.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I really didn't do much.	Ntabwo rwose nakoze byinshi.
I'm afraid to look.	Mfite ubwoba bwo kureba.
But you can find more.	Ariko urashobora kubona byinshi.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I'm not very good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza cyane.
It's the same.	Buri kimwe.
He wanted to make this film.	Yashakaga gukora iyi firime.
I was a young child at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umwana muto.
Money was not a thing.	Amafaranga ntiyari ikintu.
We all have a lot to learn.	Twese dufite byinshi byo kwiga.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
No phone.	Nta terefone.
I don't see any of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo mbona.
But there are children.	Ariko hariho abana.
That would be normal.	Ibyo byari kuba bisanzwe.
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.
Living with him.	Kubana na we.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I was so beautiful.	Nari mwiza cyane.
I wanted to be in that house.	Nashakaga kuba muri iyo nzu.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It's not good, but it's really good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko nibyiza rwose.
That's great.	Ibyo ni byiza cyane.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I wonder if this will happen to me soon.	Ndabaza niba ibi bizaba njye vuba.
That day is not today.	Uwo munsi ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
Hano hano.	Hano hano.
The day was beautiful.	Umunsi wari mwiza.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
Apparently he saw it.	Biragaragara ko yabonye.
This is obvious.	Ibi biragaragara.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
In front of him.	Imbere ye.
One has to do it alone.	Umuntu agomba kubikora wenyine.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It was his car.	Yari imodoka ye.
I don't want to do it again.	Sinshaka kongera kubikora.
This is good for me.	Ibi nibyiza kuri njye.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
We had none.	Ntabwo twari dufite.
If you have a family.	Niba ufite umuryango.
And he knows you can do it.	Kandi azi ko ushobora kubikora.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza.
She doesn't like children.	Ntabwo akunda abana.
I have a very good idea.	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
From his room.	Kuva mu cyumba cye.
He didn't know how to do it all the time.	Ntabwo yari azi kubikora igihe cyose.
He could see.	Yashoboraga kureba.
Or just people.	Cyangwa abantu gusa.
He is out here with us all.	Ari hanze hano hamwe natwe twese.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I have done nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nigeze nkora.
If anything.	Niba hari ikintu.
And my daughter is right.	Kandi umukobwa wanjye afite ukuri.
I have to go too.	Ninjye ugomba kugenda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
You have problems.	Ufite ibibazo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's true.	Ni ukuri kuri.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
I had a small problem.	Nagize ikibazo gito.
I was in his house.	Nari mu nzu ye.
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.
You are going to be beautiful.	Ugiye kuba mwiza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
The guy.	Umusore.
I was very far away.	Nari kure cyane.
Probably not inside.	Birashoboka ko atari imbere.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
Everyone was human.	Umwe wese yari umuntu.
Can you see the error?	Urashobora kubona amakosa?
Like me	Nkanjye.
She was a beautiful woman.	Yari umugore mwiza.
The boy is doing things.	Umuhungu arimo gukora ibintu.
However, he likes to talk a lot.	Ariko, akunda byinshi byo kuvuga.
We are human too.	Natwe turi abantu.
In your house.	Mu nzu yawe.
It's too young for me.	Ni muto cyane kuri njye.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
From the house.	Kuva mu nzu.
We have a lot of money.	Dufite amafaranga menshi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I can wait.	Nshobora gutegereza.
He’s thinking a lot and not really.	Arimo gutekereza cyane kandi sibyo rwose.
A good player is going to get a job.	Umukinnyi mwiza agiye kubona akazi.
Like me, today.	Nkanjye, uyu munsi.
In fact, this is true.	Mubyukuri, ibi ni ukuri.
There are people.	Hariho abantu.
That is what he expected.	Ibyo ni byo yari yiteze.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
She was a wonderful woman to me and to me.	Wari umugore mwiza kuri njye no kuri njye.
It wasn’t close enough.	Ntabwo byari hafi bihagije.
Maybe with a movie.	Ahari hamwe na firime.
I would not stay.	Ntabwo nari kuguma.
None of this is bad.	Nta na kimwe muri byo kibi.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I can't see.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona.
They were not friends.	Ntabwo bari inshuti.
We were here before.	Twari hano mbere.
He started the car.	Yatangiye imodoka.
He knows everything about it.	Azi byose kuri byo.
Everyone.	Umuntu wese.
I felt bad.	Numvise nabi.
Not good for everyone.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri buri wese.
Please? 	Nyamuneka?
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He said he did not know for sure.	Yavuze ko atari azi neza.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi nibyo aribyo byose.
I want to know what you think.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo utekereza.
He does nothing.	Ntacyo akora.
But that’s not easy.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
I don't mean to say.	Ntashaka kuvuga.
You know nothing.	Ntacyo uzi.
Or, well, well.	Cyangwa, neza.
He has something to say, something to say.	Hari icyo avuga, hari icyo avuga.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
What you have to believe.	Ibyo ugomba kwizera.
That's why.	Impamvu ni yo mpamvu.
I hope that is the case.	Ndizera ko aricyo kibazo.
That is something else.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu.
I want you to think about things for me.	Ndashaka ko utekereza ibintu kuri njye.
But there is a small problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo gito.
You have to listen.	Ugomba kumva.
No one was inside.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari imbere.
We were close.	Twari hafi.
And before that.	Kandi mbere.
I can't even figure out what it is.	Sinshobora no kubona icyo aricyo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, birashoboka ko aribyo.
It is not his fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
Nothing on the phone.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri terefone.
One week each.	Buri cyumweru kimwe.
I'm not you.	Ntabwo ndi wowe.
The guy knows what he's doing.	Umusore azi ibyo akora.
I was the only woman in the room.	Nari umugore wenyine mu cyumba.
What you want is possible.	Icyo ushaka birashoboka.
I had a bad day.	Nagize umunsi mubi.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
And sometimes you just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe ugomba gushaka ibintu ukeneye.
He was glad he asked.	Yishimiye ko yabajije.
He said he never did.	Yavuze ko atigeze abikora.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
Not a good time.	Ntabwo ari umwanya mwiza.
Maybe another time.	Ahari ikindi gihe.
And he is right.	Kandi afite ukuri.
It took a long time.	Yafashe igihe kirekire.
No one did it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
And I just thought.	Kandi natekereje gusa.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
A very intelligent player.	Umukinnyi uzi ubwenge cyane.
To have his money.	Kugira amafaranga ye.
She is OK here.	Afite neza neza hano.
He has.	Afite.
Let everything go.	Reka ibintu byose.
He loved his father very much.	Yakundaga se cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo ari uwo.
This is a person.	Uyu ni umuntu.
I don't want to see anything.	Sinshaka kubona ikintu na kimwe.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
I think it's years.	Ntekereza ko ari imyaka.
I don't see anything else you can say.	Ntabwo mbona ikindi ushobora kuvuga.
If you can try it, fine.	Niba ushobora kugerageza, byiza.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
There is one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe.
But he knows the same thing.	Ariko azi ikintu kimwe.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza kubona.
That's what he said.	Nibyo yavuze.
He had no hope.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yizeye.
You can't come.	Ntushobora kuza.
Most people would have.	Abantu benshi bari kugira.
I'm not here.	Ntabwo ndi hano.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I also wanted to talk.	Nanjye nashakaga kuvuga.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
Probably no reason.	Ahari nta mpamvu.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
I don't like it here.	Ntabwo nkunda hano.
That's what he said.	Nibyo yavuze.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Not many, maybe.	Ntabwo ari benshi, ahari.
But this was not a school.	Ariko iyi ntiyari ishuri.
I had this problem once.	Nagize iki kibazo rimwe.
Tell me why you are here.	Mbwira impamvu uri hano.
They are good friends.	Ni inshuti nziza.
That's all.	Ibyo ni byose.
Really, for me.	Nukuri, kuri njye.
Probably at that time.	Birashoboka ko icyo gihe.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
It's a problem.	Ari ikibazo.
Today I felt good.	Uyu munsi numvise ari byiza.
When and where they would eat.	Igihe n'aho bari kurya.
And nothing.	Kandi nta na kimwe.
Hearing everything, and doing nothing.	Kumva byose, kandi ntacyo ukora.
Many, many things.	Ibintu byinshi, byinshi.
She is beautiful and loving.	Ni mwiza kandi ukunda.
Just one of the many.	Umwe gusa muri benshi.

And, really good.	Kandi, nibyiza rwose.
We don't need anything else.	Ntabwo dukeneye ikindi.
And that is not good.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
That is possible.	Hariho ibyo bishoboka.
It is not his gift.	Ntabwo ari impano ye.
Maybe it's good.	Ahari nibyiza.
He was a bad person.	Yari umuntu mubi.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
Not that he has to.	Ntabwo ari uko agomba.
I am a favorite person.	Ndi umuntu ukunda.
You can tell from afar.	Urashobora kubwira kure.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
He had a problem.	Yari afite ikibazo.
I was a very young boy at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umuhungu muto cyane.
Why?	Kuki?
And probably not.	Kandi birashoboka ko atari byo.
Time to go far.	Igihe cyo kujya kure.
We have to act fast.	Tugomba gukora vuba.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I can't wait to see everything.	Sinshobora gutegereza kubona byose.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
He hadn't been out in a long time.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe kinini hanze.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.

He is just trying to help.	Arimo kugerageza gusa gufasha.
He said he did not know why.	Yavuze ko atazi impamvu yabikoze.
Drink in it.	Kunywa muri yo.
I am younger than him.	Ndi muto kuri we.
When you have that, you have a lot.	Iyo ufite ibyo, ufite byinshi.
He seemed to have everything.	Yasaga nkaho afite byose.
I have to live together.	Ninjye ugomba kubana.
Short time,.	Umwanya muto,.
He said for a long time.	Yavuze igihe kirekire.
Not too many.	Nta benshi cyane.
School does nothing.	Ishuri ntacyo ukora.
I didn't know what happened.	Sinari nzi uko byagenze.
Good things.	Ibintu byiza.
For me.	Kuri njye.
You have to do something.	Ugomba kugira icyo ukora.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
Why do you think of anything else.	Kuki utekereza ikindi kintu cyose.
Eventually it was gone.	Amaherezo yari yagiye.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
But things are not easy.	Ariko ibintu ntabwo byoroshye.
I really am.	Ndi mubyukuri.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He was looking for food.	Yashakaga ibiryo.
You have to know better than that.	Ugomba kumenya neza kuruta ibyo.
Not much to say.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo kuvuga.
At that time I had hair.	Icyo gihe nari mfite umusatsi.
I understand everything.	Ndumva byose.
He was thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
It will be here.	Bizaba hano.
And that's a bad thing.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu kibi.
Almost everyone.	Hafi ya bose.
It was good, the truth was enough, but it was not.	Yari mwiza, ukuri bihagije, ariko sibyo.
And we have work to do.	Kandi dufite akazi ko gukora.
And it was about the same time.	Kandi byari hafi igihe kimwe.
That's a good thing.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza.
That's great for him.	Nibyiza cyane kuri we.
You found his house.	Wabonye inzu ye.
You have what you want.	Ufite icyo ushaka.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He’s just a guy.	Ni umusore gusa.
We have to go, far away, from here.	Tugomba kugenda, kure, kuva hano.
And he knew it was true.	Kandi yari azi ko ari ukuri.
All meetings together.	Inama bose hamwe.
To say what he says.	Kuvuga icyo avuga.
I hope you can do it.	Nizere ko ushobora kubikora.
He saw.	Yabonye.
The little boy knew he was scared.	Umwana muto yari azi ko afite ubwoba.
He is trying to do something good.	Arimo kugerageza gukora ikintu cyiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Only my son.	Gusa umuhungu wanjye.
Too much work.	Gukora cyane.
You don't have to.	Ntabwo ukwiye.
Probably not too bad to be around.	Birashoboka ko atari mubi cyane kuba hafi.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
He knows how to drive.	Azi gutwara imodoka.
Living with him.	Kubana na we.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
That would be true.	Ibyo byaba ari ukuri.
Let's, let's.	Reka, reka.
He could see nothing here.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona hano.
He wouldn't feel like doing another job.	Ntabwo yari kumva ko nkora ikindi gihe.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
He is the only person here in his age.	Niwe muntu wenyine hano imyaka ye.
After buying a new car.	Amaze kugura imodoka nshya.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
He went.	Yagiye.
It's a wonderful thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyane.
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
Just live.	Kubaho gusa.
It's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
That would be a mistake.	Ibyo byaba ari amakosa.
Everything outside.	Byose hanze.
He did what he did.	Yakoze ibyo yakoze.
I was scared of this.	Nari mfite ubwoba kuri ibi.
You have it alone.	Ufite wenyine.
I want to go swimming.	Ndashaka kujya koga.
Being here first.	Kuba hano mbere.
I'm here and there.	Ndi muri hano na hano.
I don't have to.	Ntabwo ngomba.
No one deserves it.	Nta muntu n'umwe ukwiye.
I know this is true.	Nzi ko ibi ari ukuri.
I have a good plan.	Mfite gahunda nziza.
He had a lot.	Yari afite byinshi.
He has been living in this house for thirty years.	Amaze imyaka mirongo itatu aba muri iyi nzu.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibyo aribyo byose.
And it is not easy.	Kandi ntabwo byoroshye.
Here we have a problem.	Hano dufite ikibazo.
To know	Kumenya.
I'm not happy about it.	Ntabwo nishimiye cyane gukora.
We are very close.	Turi hafi cyane.
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
I just do things.	Nkora ibintu gusa.
Until.	Kugeza.
He is on top.	Ari hejuru.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kubikora rimwe gusa.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
Lots of good stuff.	Byinshi kubyo byiza.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
It wouldn't have happened in the morning.	Ntabwo byari kuba mu gitondo.
He was very prepared.	Yari yiteguye cyane.
He never liked it.	Ntabwo yigeze akunda na gato.
And he wanted to do it right.	Kandi yashakaga kubikora neza.
Lots of opportunities to be there early.	Amahirwe menshi kuba ahari kare.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza cyane cyane.
There is a catch.	Hariho ibyo gufata.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
It was very far ahead.	Byari imbere cyane.
I knew it wasn't a good idea to watch a movie.	Nari nzi ko atari igitekerezo cyiza cyo kureba firime.
Tell me a very big question.	Mbwira ikibazo kinini cyane.
This is absolutely true.	Ibi rwose ni ukuri.
But I can't have this.	Ariko ntashobora kugira ibi.
Niki.	Niki.
He went with someone.	Yagiye n'umuntu.
Up and down.	Hejuru na hasi.
He was not, once.	Ntabwo yari, rimwe.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
We have to take time.	Tugomba gufata umwanya.
You can only say how he sits.	Urashobora kuvuga gusa uko yicaye.
Nothing.	Ntacyo ari cyo.
But they probably have.	Ariko birashoboka ko bafite.
To live is.	Kubaho ni.
.	.
There are good things.	Hariho ibintu byiza.
I don't know what to do from here.	Sinzi icyo gukora kuva hano.
He wanted to say more.	Yashakaga kuvuga byinshi.
She can swim very fast.	Arashobora koga vuba cyane.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
It was all true.	Byose byari ukuri.
But now there is a problem.	Ariko ubu hariho ikibazo.
You don't have to go back here.	Ntugomba gusubira hano.
Tomorrow he can regain his faith.	Ejo arashobora kongera kwizera.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
This, he would be willing to try.	Ibi, yaba yiteguye kugerageza.
But we were.	Ariko twari.
I am a man of faith.	Ndi umuntu ufite kwizera.
There are a lot of people.	Hari abantu benshi.
I need to think about this.	Nkeneye gutekereza kuri ibi.
I like the way you think.	Nkunda uburyo utekereza.
She looked good enough.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza bihagije.
I'm going to do this thing.	Ngiye gukora iki kintu.
If this.	Niba ibi.
That's what everyone had.	Nibyo abantu bose bari bafite.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
You have nothing.	Ntacyo ufite.
It's his fault.	Ni amakosa ye.
What should he be thinking?	Ni iki agomba kuba atekereza?
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
In any case.	Muri ibyo aribyo byose.
If we are here, we are here.	Niba turi hano, turi hano.
I got it wrong.	Nabonye nabi.
It was a matter of survival.	Byari ikibazo cyo kubaho.
He mentions one of us.	Avuga umwe muri twe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
But I don’t want to tell you anything else.	Ariko ntashaka kumbwira ikindi.
I did nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nakoze.
He looked to see if anyone knew.	Yarebye kureba niba hari umuntu azi.
Maybe one day, but it's not.	Ahari umunsi umwe, ariko sibyo.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
The woman was very young.	Umugore yari akiri muto cyane.
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora.
She needs to go eat.	Akeneye kujya kurya.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
You can do anything else.	Urashobora gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
She was the worst girl in school.	Yari umukobwa mubi cyane mwishuri.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
This is the same thing.	Iki ni ikintu kimwe.
You can try simple things.	Urashobora kugerageza ibintu byoroshye.
I have to play.	Ngomba gukina.
Does he have a wife or child?	Yaba afite umugore cyangwa umwana?
We were not.	Ntabwo twari twe.
Everything was on schedule.	Byose byari kuri gahunda.
I need to work fast.	Nkeneye gukora vuba.
The idea is good.	Igitekerezo ni cyiza.
Maybe it's just me.	Birashoboka ko ari njye gusa.
It's at work.	Ndi ku kazi.
I thought.	Natekereje.
And you have no reason.	Kandi nta mpamvu ufite.
I don't know anyone here.	Nta muntu n'umwe nzi hano.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
I love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa.
I had enough of that.	Nari mfite ibyo bihagije.
Who knows what happened.	Ninde uzi uko byagenze.
And she wants to be together.	Kandi arashaka kubana.
He may have been right.	Ashobora kuba yari afite ukuri.
And he.	Na we.
I thought that was the case at the time.	Natekerezaga ko icyo gihe ari ukuri.
They have to come.	Bafite kuza.
I never had to.	Sinigeze ngomba.
I didn't think so.	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo.
He once saw a man like him.	Igihe kimwe yabonye umuntu usa na we.
It was hard, but it was good.	Byari bigoye, ariko byari byiza.
All together	Twese hamwe.
You know what you have here.	Uzi icyo ufite hano.
Na se.	Na se.
My daughter has to go.	Umukobwa wanjye agomba kugenda.
No need to do so far.	Nta mpamvu yo kubikora kugeza ubu.
He was not here before.	Ntabwo yari hano mbere.
Tonight it would be nice.	Iri joro byaba byiza.
Let's, let's.	Reka, reka.
Every day was.	Buri munsi wari.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko abikora.
What you can do.	Ibyo ushobora gukora.
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
It's good to have something. '	Nibyiza kugira ikintu '.
You have a bad guy.	Ufite umusore mubi.
Find out what happened and where it was.	Kumenya uko byagenze n'aho yari ari.
They were outside.	Bari hanze.
He was in.	Yari arimo.
He thought that was good.	Yatekereje ko ibyo byari byiza.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu mubyukuri.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
I know what you think.	Nzi icyo utekereza.
You have to make money.	Ugomba gushaka amafaranga.
If you can see.	Niba ushobora kubona.
Really?	Mubyukuri?
Going back is not good enough.	Gusubira inyuma ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
He is here tonight.	Ari hano muri iri joro.
For me, eating out is a big deal.	Kuri njye, kurya hanze ni ikintu kinini.
You think so.	Uratekereza cyane.
I do not have.	Ntabwo mfite.
It was not a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo.
But he can't go.	Ariko ntashobora kugenda.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
People know how to say a lot.	Abantu bazi neza kuvuga byinshi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I think this is true.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari ukuri.
We have to have that.	Tugomba kugira ibyo.
He has a son.	Afite umuhungu.
She has to be home by now.	Agomba kuba murugo kugeza ubu.
It seems like we have the same idea.	Birasa nkaho dufite igitekerezo kimwe.
That's right.	Nibyiza nibyo.
I'm just here.	Ndi hano gusa.
You know the plan.	Uzi gahunda.
We have to find something else.	Tugomba gushaka ikindi kintu.
Friends are absolutely right.	Inshuti nibyo rwose.
He will do it alone.	Azabikora wenyine.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
I was well aware now.	Nari nzi neza ubu.
Everything would be on schedule.	Ibintu byose byari kuba kuri gahunda.
I don't want to go.	Ntashaka kugenda.
He was ready to do it.	Yari yiteguye kubikora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo.
He was a bad person.	Yari umuntu mubi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
But you don't like what you think.	Ariko ntabwo ukunda ibyo utekereza.
In fact, it's really good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
Especially what he thought.	Cyane cyane icyo yatekerezaga.
Question.	Ikibazo.
It's a little simpler, but in reality it is possible.	Nibyiza byoroshye gato, ariko mubyukuri birashoboka.
Why? 	Kuki?
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, nibyiza rwose.
Okay, just a little bit.	Nibyiza, gusa gato.
He didn’t say much, in fact.	Ntabwo yavuze byinshi, mubyukuri.
I didn't know what happened.	Sinari nzi uko byagenze.
You had very close.	Wari ufite hafi cyane.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu kibi cyane gukora.
It's good to have a good life.	Nibyiza kubana neza.
Up and up.	Hejuru kandi hejuru.
They are lucky.	Bafite amahirwe.
They were worried.	Bari bafite impungenge.
Good kid, that was true.	Umwana mwiza, byari ukuri.
Or look up.	Cyangwa kureba hejuru.
He was a man like me.	Yari umuntu nkanjye.
Being at work all day.	Kuba ku kazi umunsi wose.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
'	'
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
I found a house.	Nabonye inzu.
But this was really good.	Ariko ibi byari byiza rwose.
It will not be a school.	Ntabwo bizaba ishuri.
Never enough	Nta na rimwe bihagije.
They were close to him.	Bari hafi ye.
You don't think so.	Ntabwo utekereza neza.
He does everything right.	Akora byose neza.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
And indeed we are.	Kandi rwose turi.
Being human.	Kuba umuntu.
Yes, you were right.	Nibyo, wari ufite ukuri.
Maybe you want to try something else.	Birashoboka ko ushaka kugerageza ikindi.
We have a lot to do.	Dufite byinshi byo gukora.
He had a problem getting a job.	Yari afite ikibazo cyo kubona akazi.
Any child can speak.	Umwana wese arashobora kuvuga.
I love,.	Nkunda ,.
The young man felt that he did not want to leave.	Umusore yumvise ko adashaka kugenda.
I have something to look at.	Mfite ikintu ukwiye kureba.
I was not sure if that was the case.	Sinari nzi neza niba aribyo.
He was out alone.	Yari hanze wenyine.
He wants to talk to you.	Ashaka kuvugana nawe.
You can also just walk.	Urashobora no kugenda gusa.
Not that he could do much.	Ntabwo ari uko yashoboraga gukora byinshi.
And again.	Gusa kandi.
You are seeing all this wrong.	Urimo kubona ibi byose nabi.
If not.	Niba atari byo.
We have to work outside.	Tugomba gukora hanze.
I think it's a great thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza cyane.
I have what we need.	Mfite ibyo dukeneye.
Everyone has the same problem.	Umuntu wese ufite ikibazo kimwe.
This is not good.	Iyi ntabwo ari nziza.
It's too low.	Ari hasi cyane.
The child was bad.	Umwana yari mubi.
He had to overcome this.	Yagombaga gutsinda ibi.
It was a great day to stay in the house.	Wari umunsi mwiza wo kuguma mu nzu.
He had come ready.	Yari yaje yiteguye.
I thought maybe.	Natekereje ahari.
It's a good time.	Nibyiza umwanya.
But he can't go.	Ariko ntashobora kugenda.
He wanted to go, now.	Yashakaga kugenda, ubu.
I don't know why.	Ntabwo nzi impamvu.
She was probably hairy.	Birashoboka ko yari umusatsi.
You are	Uri wowe.
Good plan.	Gahunda nziza.
I really am.	Nukuri ndi.
As you should.	Nkuko ugomba.
We don't need this.	Ntabwo dukeneye ibi.
It would be great to play.	Byaba byiza rwose gukina.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
They are not in that.	Ntabwo bari muri ibyo.
I wonder how old he is, actually.	Ndabaza imyaka afite, mubyukuri.
It's the same thing here.	Ni ikintu kimwe hano.
There is one family.	Hari umuryango umwe.
I hope this is good.	Ndizera ko ibi ari byiza.
He saw that.	Yabonye ibyo.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, birashoboka cyane.
He went into this program.	Yagiye muri iyi gahunda.
He did very well.	Yakoze neza cyane.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
I hope you can help.	Nizere ko ushobora gufasha.
Probably a very small thing.	Birashoboka ko ari ikintu gito cyane.
He wanted so much.	Yashakaga cyane.
You can see.	Urashobora kubona.
Is it possible?	Birashoboka?
This is good.	Ubu ni byiza.
That was him now.	Uwo yari we ubu.
He had a job to do.	Yari afite akazi ko gukora.
He also went.	Na we yagiye.
Reading is nothing.	Gusoma ntacyo.
Good luck to us.	Amahirwe kuri twe.
This was a lot.	Ibi byari byinshi.
The boy doesn't know what to say.	Umuhungu ntazi icyo avuga.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri.
There are a lot of people in his house.	Mu nzu ye hari abantu benshi.
I need to try harder.	Nkeneye kugerageza cyane.
All the best so far.	Ibintu byose byiza kugeza ubu.
Everyone was very close.	Abantu bose bari hafi cyane.
It's really bad.	Ni mubi rwose.
He could have done that for a long time.	Yashoboraga kubikora igihe kirekire.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
I am your best friend.	Ndi inshuti yawe nziza.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
Like me	Nkanjye.
But that's just us.	Ariko ibyo ni twe gusa.
He loves that.	Akunda ibyo.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I am not happy with this plan.	Ntabwo nishimiye iyi gahunda.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
Or try.	Cyangwa kugerageza.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
Great idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
He would do the same.	Na we yari gukora.
He had to go.	Yagombaga kugenda.
Or maybe this is it.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko ari iyi.
Yes, there is only one thing.	Nibyo, hari ikintu kimwe gusa.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I have been very lucky so far.	Nagize amahirwe menshi kugeza ubu.
Taking my baby.	Gufata umwana wanjye.
We don’t need the time we have right now.	Ntabwo dukeneye umwanya dufite ubu.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
I doubt if they were on him.	Ndashidikanya niba bari kuri we.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
He had to say something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo avuga.
I mean, when he was there.	Ndashaka kuvuga, igihe yari ahari.
Inside, there are.	Imbere, hari.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo yashakaga.
I need to take a good look.	Nkeneye kureba neza.
There are many of us.	Hariho benshi muri twe.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
But right now he is the right person.	Ariko kuri ubu niwe muntu ukwiye.
Very good, bad expert.	Nibyiza cyane, umuhanga mubi.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
But it is not close.	Ariko ntabwo iri hafi.
And work is work.	Kandi akazi ni akazi.
Same with you.	Kimwe nawe.
The money is worth it !.	Amafaranga akwiye!.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
That's not what he expected.	Ntabwo ari uko yari yiteze.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
It's just not that easy.	Gusa ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
In fact, you should not be alone with me.	Mubyukuri, ntugomba kuba wenyine nanjye.
That's what hair does.	Nibyo umusatsi ukora.
You are right.	Wavuze neza.
Each is a gift.	Buri kimwe ni impano.
To think that a person was young, when he was.	Gutekereza ko umuntu yari muto, igihe yari ariko.
I want to know more.	Ndashaka kumenya neza.
You didn't mention dogs.	Ntabwo wavuze imbwa.
We have a lot to eat.	Dufite byinshi byo kurya.
Something.	Ikintu.
He has to be outside.	Agomba kuba hanze.
I feel the latter.	Numva kuri nyuma.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo nibyo.
I'm not that person.	Ntabwo ndi uwo muntu.
But there is more to come.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo kuza.
He hears questions.	Yumva ibibazo.
I thought he needed help.	Natekereje ko akeneye ubufasha.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
I mean the player.	Ndashaka kuvuga umukinnyi.
He does nothing here.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora hano.
You can.	Urashobora.
It is I who do it.	Ni 'njye' kubikora.
His wife was in front of him.	Umugore we yari imbere ye.
We have to go fast.	Tugomba kugenda vuba.
She had a child.	Yari afite umwana.
She is not a woman.	Ntabwo ari umugore.
They were all there.	Bose bari aho.
But he needed to know more.	Ariko yari akeneye kumenya byinshi.
Getting a job.	Kubona akazi.
It's not a bad read.	Ntabwo ari gusoma nabi.
I really am not.	Ntabwo rwose ndi.
But he had done nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yari yakoze.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, birashoboka ko yabikoze.
You can't get a job.	Ntushobora kubona akazi.
If not, you may not see much.	Niba atari byo, ntushobora kubona byinshi.
But then he got in touch with someone.	Ariko nyuma yaje kuvugana n'umuntu.
It was not a good plan.	Ntabwo yari gahunda nziza.
That's not the whole point here.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo rwose hano.
Not if you want to go back outside.	Ntabwo niba ushaka gusubira hanze.
Very good nearby.	Nibyiza cyane hafi.
He really wanted to stay.	Yashakaga rwose kuguma.
No one was here.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hano.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
Everything is possible.	Byose birashoboka.
He was not one of them.	Ntiyari muri kimwe muri byo.
Swim too fast.	Koga vuba cyane.
At his house.	Ku nzu ye.
Now I can look in front of me.	Ubu nshobora kureba imbere yanjye.
Here, everything is recent.	Hano, ibintu byose ni vuba aha.
In fact, anything but.	Mubyukuri, ikintu cyose ariko.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
That's exactly what happened.	Nukuri nkuko byagenze.
I can't think of anything worse.	Sinshobora gutekereza ku kintu kibi.
Or they were.	Cyangwa bari.
I don't know what.	Sinzi icyo.
Good for everyone.	Nibyiza kuri bose.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It would be nice to work.	Byari kuba byiza gukora.
Walking is good.	Kugenda ni byiza.
But sometimes you have to do it.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe ugomba kubikora.
I have a lot of money and a lot of money.	Mfite amafaranga menshi kandi menshi.
I think here.	Ndatekereza hano.
It's not that hard.	Ntabwo bigoye rwose.
Did he go?	Yagiye?
If he had, he could not have left.	Niba yari afite, ntabwo yashoboraga kugenda.
He wanted to know everything.	Yashakaga kumenya ibintu byose.
I really needed it at the time.	Nari nkeneye rwose icyo gihe.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
It is not difficult for me.	Ntabwo bigoye kuri njye.
So far everything has been normal.	Kugeza ubu ibintu byose byari bisanzwe.
But he is not alone.	Ariko si we wenyine.
It's inside.	Ni imbere.
He had to think about her.	Yagombaga gutekereza kuri we.
Was that true?	Byari ukuri?.
I want to see.	Ndashaka kureba.
Everything is the same at the same time.	Buri kintu ni umwanya umwe mugihe.
He once saw a man like him.	Igihe kimwe yabonye umuntu usa na we.
It is also possible to quit now.	Birashoboka kandi kureka ubu.
This is obviously not the case.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari byo.
We don't need any of that.	Ntabwo dukeneye na kimwe muri byo.
He went.	Yagiye.
And he just had it in front of him.	Kandi yari afite gusa imbere ye.
Kinini.	Kinini.
I love everything you do.	Nkunda ibyo ukora byose.
Well, at least you didn't go down without explaining yourself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri urashobora kubikora.
Or plan.	Cyangwa gahunda.
He seems to think it's my fault.	Asa naho atekereza ko ari amakosa yanjye.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Waiting for more.	Gutegereza byinshi.
And it was normal.	Kandi byari bisanzwe.
He said he had.	Yavuze ko yari afite.
The problem of trying too many.	Ikibazo cyo kugerageza byinshi.
Who were you?	Wari wowe?.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He had a lot to think about.	Yari afite byinshi byo gutekereza.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
They knew better.	Bari bazi neza.
Maybe together we can figure this out.	Ahari hamwe dushobora kumenya iki kintu.
Today, there is a lot of money.	Uyu munsi, hari amafaranga menshi.
You are my son.	Uri umuhungu wanjye.
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
My clothes were on.	Imyenda yanjye yari imbere.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira ntabwo aribyo.
Like a movie.	Nka firime.
But he was right.	Ariko yari afite ukuri.
You don't have to take anything.	Ntugomba gufata ikintu na kimwe.
One can do it.	Umuntu arashobora kubikora.
I knew nothing.	Ntacyo nari nzi.
He just seemed to like it when he left school.	Gusa yasaga naho yishimiye kuva mu ishuri.
There are good things here.	Hano hari ibintu byiza.
It's the same with us.	Ni kimwe natwe.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He said.	Yavuze .
You have to learn to eat.	Ugomba kwiga kurya.
My son.	Umuhungu wanjye.
This sounds good, too.	Ibi birasa neza, kandi.
I want it here.	Ndashaka hano.
I was looking for a dog.	Nashakaga imbwa.
That's not good.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
He doesn't need to.	Ntabwo akeneye.
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
Obviously there was a lot I saw.	Biragaragara ko hari byinshi nabonye.
Whatever he does, he does well.	Ibyo akora byose, akora neza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
You can't really ask for more, can you?	Ntushobora rwose gusaba byinshi, urashobora?.
But he does not.	Ariko ntabwo akora.
I hope that's good.	Ndizera ko ibyo ari byiza.
Everything is really good.	Byose ni byiza rwose.
Here, no.	Hano, nta.
It was almost everything.	Byari hafi ya byose.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I want to help.	Ndashaka gufasha.
We don't need to do that here.	Ntabwo dukeneye kubikora hano.
I think there is something wrong here.	Ntekereza ko hano hari amakosa.
We are not the only ones who are scared.	Ntabwo ari twe gusa dufite ubwoba.
He had seen the car before.	Yabonye imodoka mbere.
Drink well.	Kunywa neza.
You can believe it is possible.	Urashobora kwizera ko bishoboka.
It's good to see things.	Nibyiza kureba ibintu.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I'm not trying.	Ntabwo ndimo kugerageza.
Bottom line.	Hasi hasi.
You don’t think about what you do.	Ntabwo utekereza kubyo ukora.
That he was also involved.	Ko nawe yari arimo.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I want to be here.	Ndashaka kuba hano.
However, it is not very difficult.	Ariko, ntabwo bigoye cyane.
It was not very good.	Ntiyari mwiza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I don't know what he's doing.	Sinzi icyo arimo gukora.
I think that's possible.	Ndatekereza ko bishoboka.
So far, so good.	Kure cyane, mubyukuri.
Behind.	Inyuma.
But it looks good.	Ariko birasa neza.
I was young.	Nari muto.
It was hard for everyone.	Byari bigoye kuri buri wese.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
Not many, maybe.	Ntabwo ari benshi, ahari.
You are at home.	Uri murugo.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
But he is not ready for work.	Ariko ntabwo yiteguye akazi.
Very good !.	Byiza cyane!.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
This one may be time consuming.	Uyu ashobora kuba akora igihe.
You have to have that.	Ugomba kugira ibyo.
You are smart.	Ufite ubwenge.
There is so much to see tomorrow.	Ejo hari byinshi byo kubona.
No one did anything.	Nta n'umwe wigeze agira icyo akora.
We are many.	Turi benshi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
He wanted to see.	Yashakaga kureba.
He did not know what it was.	Ntiyari azi icyo ari cyo.
And it's not easy.	Kandi ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
More than ever	Kurenza ubu.
I had a job.	Nari mfite akazi.
I want to know everything about him.	Ndashaka kumenya byose kuri we.
I don't want anything in the house.	Sinshaka ikintu na kimwe mu nzu.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
Here it is!	Hano ni!
I think that's the problem for us.	Ntekereza ko aricyo kibazo kuri twe.
He was looking for something.	Yashakaga ikintu.
There is before and after.	Hariho mbere na nyuma.
I was scared too.	Nanjye nagize ubwoba.
This is not possible.	Ibi ntabwo bishoboka.
I could never ask for better friends.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora gusaba inshuti nziza.
Almost everyone.	Hafi ya bose.
What he said.	Ibyo yavuze.
I don't want to hear.	Sinshaka kumva.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
But he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ariko yari azi ko yabikoze.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He can be anyone.	Ashobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ahari.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
He is just a man.	Ni umuntu gusa.
My friend is here.	Inshuti yanjye hano.
You don't need money.	Ntabwo ukeneye amafaranga.
That's all we can do.	Ibyo aribyo byose dushobora gukora.
Is there a bus nearby?	Hano hari bisi hafi hano?
I see it all the time.	Mbona buri gihe.
At the time, I didn't know anything.	Icyo gihe nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
They were both embarrassed.	Bombi bari bafite isoni.
That's a good day.	Ibyo ni umunsi mwiza.
He saw this.	Yabonye ibi.
At the time, no one knew exactly what it was.	Icyo gihe nta muntu numwe wari uzi neza icyo aricyo.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
Among the people around me.	Muri abantu hafi yanjye.
Anytime.	Igihe ni cyose.
He is obviously not human.	Biragaragara ko atari umuntu.
You have no one.	Nta muntu ufite.
That is not the case today.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo muri iki gihe.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
Quit.	Kureka.
But he doesn't understand.	Ariko ntabwo yumva.
It is not difficult to understand why.	Ntabwo bigoye kumva impamvu.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
It was hard for me.	Kuri njye byari bigoye.
There is a party here.	Hano hari ibirori.
I don't ask much.	Ntabwo ndabaza byinshi.
You have to talk to him.	Ugomba kuvugana nawe.
We have to be on it.	Tugomba kuba kuri yo.
It's not a good thing at all.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza rwose.
We must do the same.	Natwe tugomba kubikora.
I was once human again.	Nigeze kuba umuntu kandi.
More and more.	Byinshi kandi byinshi.
They are all up here.	Bose bari hejuru hano.
I know everything he does.	Nzi buri kintu cyose akora.
I didn’t want to see anyone.	Sinifuzaga kubona umuntu.
I knew he had nothing better to do.	Nari nzi ko nta cyiza yari afite.
I'm afraid that's the case.	Mfite ubwoba ko aribyo.
She loved being with him.	Yakundaga kubana na we.
He had to live with that.	Yagombaga kubana nibyo.
But here, nothing.	Ariko hano, nta na kimwe.
I want to know why.	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu.
I never heard what he said.	Sinigeze numva ibyo yavuze.
He left quickly.	Yagiye vuba vuba.
All of this is good, as he chose to stay here.	Ibi byose nibyiza, nkuko yahisemo kuguma hano.
And it's good for me.	Kandi ni byiza kuri njye.
''	''.
There is her son.	Hariho umuhungu we.
Gone, gone.	Yagiye, yagiye.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I didn't have one.	Ntabwo nari mfite.
That was very easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye cyane.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
We have time.	Dufite umwanya.
I'm not very good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza cyane.
They have a lot.	Bafite byinshi.
I don't have to do this.	Ntabwo ngomba gukora ibi.
He knew how to do it.	Yari azi kubikora.
And that's a good thing.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
You are not a woman.	Ntabwo uri umugore.
It can't go well.	Ntashobora kugenda neza.
I know it's not me.	Nzi ko atari njye.
He did what he did.	Yakoze ibyo yakoze.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He took the time.	Yafashe umwanya.
He works hard every day.	Akora cyane buri munsi.
I really enjoyed this one.	Nishimiye cyane iyi.
Is it okay?	Nibyiza?.
I don't want to do it here.	Sinshaka kubikora hano.
It's not you.	Ntabwo ari nawe.
Not at all.	Nta gihe kimwe.
I can't go back now.	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
Did you just see what he did?	Wabonye ibyo yakoze gusa?
Only true.	Gusa ni ukuri.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
Sometimes very.	Rimwe na rimwe cyane.
One thing he knew for sure.	Ikintu kimwe yari azi neza.
He was too young for her.	Yari akiri muto cyane kuri we.
She probably has only one son.	Birashoboka cyane ko afite umuhungu umwe gusa.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
But he needed someone to do it.	Ariko yari akeneye umuntu wo kubikora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birasa neza neza.
Learning things.	Kwiga ibintu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
All together	Byose hamwe.
He would do a lot of things today.	Yaba akora ibintu byinshi uyumunsi.
And let it be.	Kandi reka.
You have to come.	Ugomba kuza.
He had.	Yari afite.
They both knew what he was doing.	Bombi bari bazi ibyo yakoze.
You would do a lot.	Wari gukora byinshi.
We were not very close.	Ntabwo twari hafi cyane.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
We don't need your time.	Ntabwo dukeneye umwanya wawe.
I found the house easy.	Nabonye inzu byoroshye.
Inside.	Imbere.
Both are close.	Bombi bari hafi.
What are you going to do?	Ugiye gukora iki?
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza neza.
He really did.	Yakoze rwose.
There are people downstairs.	Hano hari abantu hasi.
But he was a good dog.	Ariko yari imbwa nziza.
He wants to talk.	Arashaka kuvuga.
You can do this.	Ibi urashobora kubikora.
There are things of faith.	Hariho ibintu byo kwizera.
He looked good tonight.	Yarebye neza muri iri joro.
You don’t have to do everything on your own.	Ntugomba gukora byose wenyine.
Much better than before.	Byiza cyane kuruta mbere.
That is the person.	Uwo ni we muntu.
She came to feel loved by a child.	Yaje kumva akunda umwana.
But today, he was worried.	Ariko muri iki gihe, yagize impungenge.
We can't go.	Ntidushobora kugenda.
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hafi ya byose.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
Your teacher has been away for a long time.	Umwarimu wawe yagiye mugihe kirekire.
But he had many friends.	Ariko yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
He started driving.	Yatangiye gutwara.
No one knew here.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi hano.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
I don't mean to say.	Ntashaka kuvuga.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
Same with you.	Kimwe nawe.
He needed money.	Yari akeneye amafaranga.
And we need everything we can get.	Kandi dukeneye ibyo dushobora kubona byose.
Good study of a person.	Kwiga neza umuntu.
I want to know what happened next.	Ndashaka kumenya uko byagenze nyuma.
He has me alone.	Afite njye wenyine.
If you have time.	Niba ufite umwanya.
It will be difficult.	Bizaba bigoye.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
Once a week is good.	Rimwe mu cyumweru ni byiza.
They were so many.	Bari benshi cyane.
I just didn't know what to do.	Gusa sinari nzi icyo gukora.
Are you sure that was enough?	Uzi neza ko ibyo byari bihagije?
Especially here in this room.	Cyane cyane hano muri iki cyumba.
It was good to play.	Byari byiza gukina.
Big question.	Ikibazo kinini.
She is just a girl.	Ni umukobwa gusa.
You can't talk to him.	Ntushobora kuvugana nawe.
Maybe with him is someone who can do anything.	Ahari hamwe na we ni umuntu ushobora gukora ikintu cyose.
He did well for everyone.	Yakoze neza kuri buri wese.
He is a very good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
There are many things here.	Hano hari ibintu byinshi.
Now more than ever.	Ubu kuruta ikindi gihe cyose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
What do you want to do?	Urashaka gukora iki?
No good, maybe.	Nta byiza, birashoboka.
Someone agreed without a problem.	Umuntu yemeye nta kibazo.
He looked at himself.	Yarebye wenyine.
He did wrong, not me.	Yakoze nabi, si njye.
We don't need to go far.	Ntabwo dukeneye kujya kure.
He never had a job.	Ntiyigeze agira akazi.
Or children.	Cyangwa abana.
That's fine with us.	Nibyiza natwe.
Ninde.	Ninde.
Doing something is something.	Gukora ikintu ni ikintu.
He was inside the house from the beginning.	Yari imbere mu nzu kuva mbere.
He was my best friend.	Yari inshuti yanjye rwose.
I don't know where you're going.	Ntazi iyo ugiye.
First and foremost, you need to know what you are looking for.	Mbere na mbere, ugomba kumenya icyo urimo gushaka.
One day is bad.	Umunsi umwe ni mubi.
I'm glad you're beautiful.	Nishimiye ko uri mwiza.
Much to think about.	Byinshi byo gutekereza.
There is a lot of money.	Hariho amafaranga menshi.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
Everything is the way it is.	Ibintu byose ni uburyo.
He tried to look closely.	Yagerageje kureba hafi.
You may not even know it exists.	Ntushobora no kumenya ko ahari.
But what you need most.	Ariko ibyo ukeneye cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He thought everything was fine.	Yatekereje ko byose ari byiza.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
Tell me what to do.	Mbwira icyo gukora.
He thought it wasn’t much.	Yatekereje ko atari byinshi.
He is a very loving person.	Numuntu ukunda cyane.
I got it right.	Nabonye neza.
One of the many.	Kimwe muri byinshi.
You know what to do.	Uzi icyo gukora.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
I have a good idea.	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza.
It was really hard.	Byari bigoye rwose.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo.
I had nothing and I had nothing.	Ntacyo nari mfite kandi ntacyo nari mfite.
And, last but not least, the headline made you read this article.	Kandi, amaherezo, birashoboka ko byari byiza.
He’s obviously a little ahead today.	Biragaragara ko ari imbere gato muri iki gihe.
He can do as he pleases.	Arashobora gukora uko ashaka.
He says that one day, he will have a car.	Avuga ko, umunsi umwe, azaba afite imodoka.
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.

I wanted to.	Nashakaga.

But there is nothing to do.	Ariko nta cyo gukora.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
He said no one believed him.	Yavuze ko nta muntu nizera.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I am everything else.	Ndi ikindi kintu cyose.
My son.	Umuhungu wanjye.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I never thought of leaving here.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuva hano.
I have never seen anyone.	Sinigeze mbona umuntu.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I want to be me.	Ndashaka kuba njye.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze akora na gato.
It's not scary.	Ntabwo ari ubwoba.
That's what we need to know.	Nibyo dukeneye kumenya.
You are scared of everything.	Ufite ubwoba kuri byose.
It was very difficult to watch.	Byari bigoye cyane kureba.
There is a time for you.	Hariho igihe wowe.
But a little work.	Ariko akazi gato.
However, the meal plan is good.	Ariko, gahunda yo kurya ni nziza.
Or that there is no.	Cyangwa ko nta.
He wants to talk.	Arashaka kuvuga.
There seems to be something here.	Nkaho hari ikintu hano.
This is really good.	Ibi rwose ni byiza.
It seems difficult.	Birasa nkaho bigoye.
He is a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I am a good boy.	Ndi umuhungu mwiza.
People you know are smart.	Abantu uzi ko bafite ubwenge.
I saw who he was.	Nabonye uwo ari we.
But here is the big problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo kinini.
I don't know where he is.	Sinzi aho ari.
He wanted to know when.	Yashakaga kumenya igihe.
I needed to read today.	Nari nkeneye gusoma uyu munsi.
None of us know what you are.	Nta n'umwe muri twe uzi icyo uri cyo.
She has been alone ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe aba wenyine.
People are everything.	Abantu ni byose.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
He thought he was a child, not a good one.	Yatekereje ko ari umwana, ntabwo ari mwiza.
But I never saw it.	Ariko sinigeze mbona.
It would not be good to go now.	Ntabwo byaba ari byiza kugenda ubu.
The guy was very nice.	Umusore yari mwiza cyane.
Nothing to see, nothing to hear.	Nta kintu cyo kubona, nta cyo kumva.
You are the problem here.	Uri ikibazo hano.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
But there I am alone.	Ariko hariho njye wenyine.
One for each.	Umwe kuri buri.
'	'
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
Just walking.	Kugenda gusa.
Behind.	Inyuma.
I know people he knows.	Nzi abantu azi.
He says he is too.	Avuga ko na we ari.
You don’t always have to take everything.	Ntabwo buri gihe ugomba gufata ibintu byose.
I need to do this.	Nkeneye gukora ibi.
But this time.	Ariko iki gihe.
But this is clear.	Ariko ibi biragaragara.
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
No one would know what he did.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kumenya ibyo yakoze.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza.
The opportunity to do something else.	Amahirwe yo gukora ikindi kintu.
You can find out why.	Urashobora kubona impamvu.
Knowing you're here.	Kumenya ko uri hano.
He asked for advice.	Yasabye inama.
It was not good to eat too much.	Ntabwo byari byiza kurya cyane.
This is the person.	Uyu ni uwo muntu.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
He was very thoughtful about the success plan.	Yatekereje cyane gutekereza kuri gahunda yo gutsinda.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I need to do something.	Nkeneye kugira icyo nkora.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo.
There is nothing to do.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gukora.
It is not his son or his family.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu we cyangwa umuryango we.
He used to go to movies.	Yakundaga kujya muri firime.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I just wanted to be in the movie.	Nashakaga gusa kuba muri firime.
I can't think of anything worse.	Sinshobora gutekereza ku kintu kimwe kibi.
Not all of us.	Ntabwo twese.
I am at home now.	Ubu ndi murugo.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
They have many children.	Bafite abana benshi.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
It was easy and easy to do.	Byari byoroshye kandi byoroshye gukora.
Sometimes things are very difficult.	Rimwe na rimwe ibintu bigoye cyane.
Either way, here it is.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hano ni.
I was so close!	Nari hafi cyane!
All, but one.	Byose, ariko kimwe.
Not much, in fact.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, mubyukuri.
Everyone should eat.	Umuntu wese agomba kurya.
You have to take the money and be careful.	Ugomba gufata amafaranga kandi neza.
He wanted normal things.	Yashakaga ibintu bisanzwe.
Not at this time.	Ntabwo ari iki gihe.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
But he must be alone.	Ariko agomba kuba wenyine.
He said he meant.	Yavuze ko yashakaga kuvuga.
But for him.	Ariko kuri we.
He hadn't thought about it for a while.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe atekereza kuri icyo kibazo.
Not on it.	Ntabwo ari kuri yo.
He says he does.	Avuga ko abikora.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
That we can be friends.	Ko dushobora kuba inshuti.
There is so much to say here.	Hano hari byinshi cyane byo kuvuga hano.
The first thing is tomorrow.	Ikintu cya mbere ejo.
He should have known better.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza.
This was far from him.	Ibi byari kure kuri we.
There are many things for us.	Hariho ibintu byinshi kuri twe.
He says let it go.	Avuga ko reka.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
I don't mean to say.	Sinshaka kuvuga.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
He just knew he had to try.	Yari azi gusa ko agomba kugerageza.
Did you have enough food today?	Wari ufite ibyo kurya bihagije uyu munsi?
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
Time.	Igihe.
I work here.	Nkora hano.
The last question.	Ikibazo cya nyuma.
One.	Umwe.
It's a good movie.	Ni firime nziza.
I think that’s just a problem.	Ntekereza ko ari ikibazo gusa.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ibintu gusa.
But not while he was at work.	Ariko atari mu gihe yari ku kazi.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I can't wait to see what you buy.	Sinshobora gutegereza kureba icyo kugura.
They are smart now.	Bafite ubwenge ubu.
Everything.	Byose.
It’s a good question to think about.	Ni ikibazo cyiza cyo gutekereza.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
You have to come here.	Ugomba kuza hano.
None of that.	Nta kintu na kimwe muri byo.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
He knows why.	Azi impamvu ahari.
We had.	Twari dufite.
I don’t know what he wants to do.	Ntazi icyo ashaka gukora.
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
He saw.	Yabonye.
A little time to wait.	Igihe gito cyo gutegereza.
He was a dog.	Yari imbwa.
I want to know more about it.	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi kuri byo.
At any time.	Igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
Today, however, this is not true.	Uyu munsi ariko, ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
Time is prison.	Igihe ni gereza.
I should have done more.	Nari nkwiye gukora byinshi.
Normal.	Ibintu bisanzwe.
Always be.	Kuba buri gihe.
Not at the moment.	Ntabwo ari muri iki gihe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga.
He could have been there.	Yashoboraga kuba ahari.
He wanted to try again.	Yashakaga kongera kugerageza.
Sometimes, he was lucky.	Rimwe na rimwe, yagize amahirwe.
I think he's out here.	Ndatekereza ko ari hanze aha.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
He knew his wife well.	Yari azi umugore we neza.
In fact, it's good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza.
But it is also very effective.	Ariko ni, kandi gukora neza cyane.
He told me I was doing nothing.	Yambwiye ko ntacyo nkora.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
I'm not going to do anything.	Ntacyo ngiye gukora.
You have your plan.	Ufite gahunda yawe.
But for me, I see you doing well so far.	Ariko kuri njye mbona ukora neza kugeza ubu.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
A young child.	Umwana muto.
I don’t know how that is possible.	Sinzi uko ibyo bishoboka.
What? 	Niki?
Most people are.	Abantu benshi ni.
Another thing I noticed.	Ikindi kintu nabonye.
I think it's a lot.	Ntekereza ko ari byinshi.
I had time, but probably not much.	Nari mfite igihe, ariko birashoboka ko atari byinshi.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
Probably the same.	Birashoboka ko ari kimwe.
I can't go now.	Ntashobora kugenda nonaha.
You tend to be a problem.	Ukunda kuba ikibazo.
The truth is.	Ukuri ni ukuri.
But everyone wanted to do that.	Ariko buri wese yashakaga gukora icyo kibazo.
Much later, when he had his own time.	Nyuma cyane, igihe yari afite umwanya we wenyine.
It's too young.	Ni muto cyane.
Definitely going to stay there.	Rwose ugiye kuguma aho.
You have to look.	Ugomba kureba.
Do you have a problem?	Ufite ikibazo?
Especially if you want to win.	Cyane cyane niba ushaka gutsinda.
Maybe one day.	Ahari umunsi umwe.
He probably had high expectations for her.	Birashoboka ko yari yiteze byinshi kuri we.
Ninde.	Ninde.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
We have to get out of this.	Tugomba kuva muri ibi.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
he said.	yavuze.
It would have been so easy.	Byari kuba byoroshye cyane.
Why did he do that.	Kuki yabikoze.
I feel it is a problem.	Numva ari ibibazo.
He said the boy.	Yavuze ko umuhungu.
At times, he tried to comment.	Rimwe na rimwe, yagerageje kugira icyo avuga.
I didn't see anyone.	Nta muntu nabonye.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
You may be right.	Urashobora kuba ufite ukuri.
He wants to know how.	Ashaka kumenya uko.
I like movies.	Nkunda firime.
And he didn't want to be.	Kandi ntiyashakaga kuba.
My son also has hearing problems.	Ikindi kandi umuhungu wanjye afite ikibazo cyo kumva.
That was hard to take.	Ibyo byari bigoye gufata.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
There is always so much.	Buri gihe hariho byinshi.
However, this is not the case here.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
And that's normal.	Kandi ibyo ni byo bisanzwe.
He made a mistake.	Yakoze amakosa.
And that's not good at all.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
This was a great time.	Uyu wari umwanya mwiza.
Tell someone.	Bwira umuntu.
It will be really good.	Bizaba byiza rwose.
It really wasn't.	Ntacyo byari cyo rwose.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
Get a good idea.	Kubona igitekerezo cyiza.
It's too far.	Ari kure cyane.
I love how I see it.	Nkunda uko mbona.
In fact, this is true of me.	Mubyukuri ibyo byari ukuri kuri njye.
He thought that was good.	Yatekereje ko ibyo byari byiza.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
I don't know girl	Sinzi umukobwa.
You are a good person.	Uri umuntu mwiza.
He may have been scared.	Ashobora kuba yari afite ubwoba.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
Yes, we are good friends.	Nibyo, turi inshuti nziza.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
As soon as possible.	Vuba bishoboka.
I know for sure.	Nzi neza rwose.
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
I am doing well.	Nkora neza.
What to do.	Icyo gukora.
I never thought of doing that.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza kubikora.
I have nothing.	Nta na kimwe mfite.
It's a great thing.	Ni ibintu byiza cyane.
I know you can do it.	Nzi ko ushobora kubikora.
And they were.	Kandi bari.
The problem of being today.	Ikibazo cyo kuba uyu munsi.
And he really loves this person.	Kandi akunda uyu muntu rwose.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
Just a boy.	Umuhungu gusa.
I'm afraid that's all we have.	Mfite ubwoba ko aribyo byose dufite.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byaba byiza.
Is everything ok	Byose ni byiza?
I'm doing something wrong.	Nkora ikintu kibi.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
I needed to know, to see.	Nari nkeneye kumenya, kubona.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I was young at the time.	Icyo gihe nari muto.
I saw that one.	Nabonye uwo.
I want to know why.	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
I am a beautiful girl.	Ndi umukobwa mwiza.
Much to think about.	Byinshi byo gutekereza.
He could have been simpler, but he had a better idea.	Yashoboraga kugira byoroshye, ariko yari afite igitekerezo cyiza.
He looked bad.	Yasaga nabi.
I want to be beautiful.	Ndashaka kuba mwiza.
This is new.	Iyi ni nshya.
Yari.	Yari.
As expected.	Nkuko yari yiteze.
They would all listen.	Bose bari kumva.
You have to come.	Ugomba kuza.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
I don’t want to eat anything today.	Sinshaka kurya ikintu muri iki gihe.
I hope your day at work is good.	Nizere ko umunsi wawe ku kazi ari mwiza.
We can't wait for more.	Ntidushobora gutegereza ikindi.
They are not human beings.	Ntabwo ari abantu.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
I can't look away.	Ntabwo nshobora kureba kure.
I am very worried.	Mfite impungenge cyane.
In the family.	Muri umuryango.
You can't take anything.	Ntushobora gufata ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
You can't even speak well.	Ntushobora no kuvuga neza.
He told his friend.	Yabwiye inshuti ye.
Good friends together	Inshuti nziza hamwe.
We have to see.	Tugomba kubona.
They were all there.	Bose bari.
If he is home now, he is worried.	Niba yari murugo ubu, afite impungenge.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ntiyari azi ikindi gukora.
I'm really bad.	Ndi mubi rwose.
He was not a young man.	Ntabwo yari umusore.
She feels like a girl.	Yumva ari umukobwa.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, rwose byari imyenda.
A little something for me.	Ikintu gito kuri njye.
You want to go far.	Ushaka kujya kure.
He knew what he wanted.	Yari azi icyo ashaka.
I wanted that.	Nashakaga ko.
Tell me everything, every little thing last.	Mbwira byose, buri kintu gito cya nyuma.
You can extend your time.	Urashobora kongera umwanya wawe.
There are a lot of people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi.
I do not have.	Ntabwo mfite.
He said.	Yavuze.
You really don't have to do it right.	Ntugomba rwose gukora neza.
That's not really the case.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
But not many.	Ariko si benshi.
It was not just an opportunity.	Ntabwo byari amahirwe gusa.
Outside and inside	Hanze no muri.
He did nothing.	Nta na kimwe yakoze.
Just what he needed.	Gusa icyo yari akeneye.
But he saw nothing.	Ariko nta na kimwe yabonye.
All of us.	Twese.
But really a good player.	Ariko rwose umukinnyi mwiza.
But we can't.	Ariko ntidushobora.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu rwose.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
We need to go.	Dukeneye kugenda.
We have food.	Dufite ibyo kurya.
It was as if he had already done so.	Yasaga nkaho yari amaze gukora.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba byiza.
We were in that.	Twari muri ibyo.
Things have not gone well recently.	Ibintu ntabwo byagenze neza vuba aha.
We had very little time.	Twari dufite umwanya muto cyane.
It's behind you.	Ari inyuma yawe.
And it's too early.	Kandi ni kare cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
The food is really good.	Ibiryo ni byiza rwose.
Only dogs.	Imbwa gusa.
A good person to do something fast.	Umuntu mwiza gukora ikintu vuba.
I didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga mubyukuri.
I want to help.	Ndashaka gufasha.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
It is not very good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza cyane.
I have a good idea.	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza.
He may have something.	Ashobora kuba afite ikintu.
'	'
He did it very well.	Yabikoze neza cyane.
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
That sounds bad.	Ibyo birasa nabi.
It's a great opportunity.	Ni amahirwe menshi.
I don't know what happened.	Sinzi uko byagenze.
He wanted to stay out.	Yashakaga kuguma hanze.
It was good at the time.	Icyo gihe byari byiza.
At that point, it would have.	Icyo gihe, byari kugira.
He just had.	Yari afite gusa.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
They have it all.	Bafite byose.
I think so too.	Ndatekereza ko na we ari.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
We have a lot to catch.	Dufite byinshi byo gufata.
I heard there was a problem coming.	Numvise ko hari ikibazo cyo kuza.
He had done nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yari yakoze.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
And that’s good, really.	Kandi ibyo nibyiza, mubyukuri.
I don't think so.	Njye mbona atari byiza.
He is a morning person.	Ni umuntu wo mu gitondo.
Obviously you need this low time.	Biragaragara ko ukeneye iki gihe cyo hasi.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
This is your time.	Uyu ni umwanya wawe.
When you need it.	Mugihe ukeneye.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
Or even to eat.	Cyangwa no kurya.
Everyone has a chance.	Umuntu wese afite amahirwe.
You don't know what you're up to.	Ntabwo uzi icyo ufite hejuru.
Once he knows the plan.	Amaze kumenya gahunda.
I need more.	Nkeneye byinshi.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
He was right about one thing.	Yari afite ukuri ku kintu kimwe.
It is very good and very good.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byiza cyane.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
They are in a meeting.	Bari mu nama.
He began to comment.	Yatangiye kugira icyo avuga.
He was not.	Ntiyari arimo.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
Bigger than that.	Kinini kuruta ibyo.
All right, that's right.	Byose, nibyo.
Someone knows.	Umuntu azi.
It wouldn't have happened today.	Ntabwo byari kubaho uyu munsi.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo.
Reading a book.	Gusoma igitabo.
I like to drive.	Nkunda gutwara.
You don't have to.	Ntabwo ukwiye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Tugomba kujya ku kazi ejo.
He doesn't have a good job.	Ntabwo afite akazi neza.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
And he was young.	Kandi yari muto.
I think he is.	Ntekereza ko ari we.
I love people who are scared.	Nkunda abantu bafite ubwoba.
I feel very good.	Numva ari byiza cyane.
That would be a lot.	Ibyo byaba ari byinshi.
Always swim before swimming.	Buri gihe koga mbere yo koga.
He was not going to play.	Ntabwo yari agiye gukina.
The idea is true.	Igitekerezo nukuri.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
I can't work on the floor.	Sinshobora gukora hasi.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
But not me.	Ariko ntabwo ari njye.
I'm happy to help.	Nishimiye gufasha.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I want to talk to you today if you are close.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe uyumunsi niba uri hafi.
He never thought there was anyone under him.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ko hari umuntu uri munsi ye.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza cyane kubikora.
He did.	Yabikoze.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo cyiza.
It has to be you.	Ugomba kuba wowe.
One look was enough.	Kureba kimwe byari bihagije.
Not much of it.	Ntabwo ari byinshi muri byo.
She likes to help.	Akunda gufasha.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
He was sitting.	Yari yicaye.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
It's not scary.	Ntabwo ari ubwoba.
Something, someone was there.	Ikintu, umuntu yari ahari.
Quit the job I did.	Reka akazi nakoze.
He knows nothing about this.	Nta kintu na kimwe ashobora kumenya kuri ibi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But they have a back.	Ariko bafite inyuma.
I saw that it was not a good thing.	Nabonye ko atari ibintu byiza.
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
I'm afraid he can.	Mfite ubwoba ko ashobora.
He is sitting very low.	Yicaye hasi cyane.
I need to go eat.	Nkeneye kujya kurya.
I had nothing to say.	Ntacyo nagize cyo kuvuga.
That was a mistake.	Ibyo byari amakosa.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
The more you can do, the better.	Uko ushobora gukora byinshi, nibyiza.
He was not human.	Ntabwo yari umuntu.
He is sitting there.	Yicaye aho.
To the phone.	Kuri terefone.
And that's just fine.	Kandi nibyiza gusa.
In this.	Muri ibi.
I can talk to anyone.	Nshobora kuvugana numuntu uwo ari we wese.
I do not believe.	Ntabwo nizera.
You don’t have to do this alone.	Ntabwo ugomba gukora ibi wenyine.
He is not a morning person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu wo mu gitondo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But it is not a job.	Ariko ntabwo ari akazi.
I'm glad that.	Nishimiye ibyo.
You have to be at home.	Ugomba kuba murugo.
He started the car.	Yatangiye imodoka.
It's not just you.	Ntabwo ari wowe gusa.
I had the money.	Nari mfite amafaranga.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
Tell me the truth.	Mbwira ukuri.
You can't read or hear anything else.	Ntushobora gusoma cyangwa kumva ikindi kintu cyose.
You are my wife.	Uri umugore wanjye.
But there is a higher.	Ariko hariho hejuru.
Or maybe it's not.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byo.
You don't think so.	Ntabwo utekereza.
I think you did the same.	Ndatekereza ko nawe wabikoze.
We have children.	Dufite abana.
He has a son.	Afite umuhungu.
No worries.	Ntabwo ari impungenge.
From there, let it go.	Kuva aho, reka reka.
Or he does things.	Cyangwa akora ibintu.
I hear him say something.	Ndumva avuga ikintu.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I don’t feel time, time.	Ntabwo numva umwanya, umwanya.
I'm worried about him.	Mfite impungenge kuri we.
It started very quickly.	Yatangiye vuba cyane.
We have to act fast.	Tugomba gukora vuba.
We don't have to wait.	Ntabwo tugomba gutegereza.
You have your advice.	Ufite inama yawe.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
There is a fear of victory.	Hariho ubwoba bwo gutsinda.
You can't live alone.	Ntushobora kubaho wenyine.
That's not the way it is.	Ntabwo ari uburyo bwa buri kintu.
I did not want to drink again.	Sinifuzaga kongera kunywa.
My wife is doing well.	Umugore wanjye akora neza.
But where he is today, he is a very good player.	Ariko aho ari uyu munsi, ni umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
We need to get a new car.	Tugomba kubona imodoka nshya.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
I was here before!	Nari hano mbere!
He went.	Yagiye.
I did nothing!	Ntacyo nakoze!
Everything is, and is.	Ibintu byose ni, kandi ni byose.
All alone.	Byose wenyine.
we can't go.	ntidushobora kugenda.
We can do nothing.	Ntacyo dushobora gukora.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
To him.	Kugeza kuri we.
One time.	Umwanya umwe.
There is so much to see!	Hariho byinshi byo kubona!
He could talk to anyone.	Yashoboraga kuvugana n'umuntu uwo ari we wese.
We were the last ones.	Twari aba nyuma.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
I can talk to you right now.	Nshobora kuvugana nawe neza ubu.
Always	Buri gihe.
He didn't really think about it.	Ntabwo yatekerezaga rwose.
It is not one of the above.	Ntabwo ari kimwe muri ibyo hejuru.
But believing this is not true.	Ariko kwizera ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
He has many friends.	Afite inshuti nyinshi.
There is a chance you can win.	Hari amahirwe ashobora gutsinda.
I was well aware of this.	Nari nzi neza ibi.
I saw this at work and at home.	Nabonye ibi ku kazi no murugo.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza.
Good hair	Umusatsi mwiza.
And everyone.	Kandi buri wese.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
He wanted to think clearly.	Yashakaga gutekereza neza.
He just liked to have people around.	Yakundaga gusa kugira abantu hafi.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
Who knows what.	Ninde uzi icyo.
They had no plans.	Ntabwo bari bafite gahunda.
I told no one.	Nta muntu nabwiye.
We shouldn't see that we are here.	Ntagomba kubona ko turi hano.
One young man tried to do it.	Umusore umwe yagerageje kubikora.
I feel it.	Ndimo ndumva.
But he could do nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yashoboraga gukora.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu icyo aricyo cyose.
He did not want to see anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kubona umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It would be too much, too soon.	Byari kuba byinshi cyane, vuba cyane.
It looks exactly right.	Birasa neza neza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Niki.	Niki.
They have money each and are a lot.	Bafite amafaranga buri umwe kandi ni menshi.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
He is.	Ni we.
He asked to study.	Yasabye kwiga.
He is trying to be good.	Arimo kugerageza kuba mwiza.
I thought he had.	Natekereje ko afite.
I need help.	Nkeneye ubufasha.
I wanted to say more.	Nashakaga kuvuga byinshi.
He did not know for sure.	Ntabwo yari azi neza.
I should have known he was a friend.	Nari nkwiye kumenya ko ari inshuti.
If so, we can find out where we are.	Niba aribyo, dushobora kumenya aho turi.
If you want.	Niba ushaka.
Not small if.	Ntabwo ari gito niba.
And, it was not easy.	Kandi ,, ntabwo byari byoroshye rwose.
I know where it is at all times.	Nzi aho ari igihe cyose.
She was a very beautiful woman.	Yari umugore mwiza cyane.
He needed to find the truth.	Yari akeneye kubona ukuri.
He is confident that he is going or not.	Yizeye neza ko agenda cyangwa ntacyo.
I have a problem figuring out what it is.	Mfite ikibazo cyo kumenya icyo aricyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, agomba kuba.
Maybe it will be enough.	Ahari bizaba bihagije.
The truth was that he could not find a family.	Ukuri ntabwo yashoboraga kubona umuryango.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
Away.	Kure.
In all things.	Muri byose.
She is worried.	Afite impungenge.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndakeka ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
It looks really good.	Birasa cyane mubyukuri.
He says it went well.	Avuga ko byagenze neza.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
You are not under your control.	Ntabwo uri munsi yawe.
He has a lot to do.	Afite byinshi byo gukora.
He is a very good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza rwose.
He is not anyone.	Ntabwo ari umuntu uwo ari we wese.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
Looks like it's possible.	Birasa nkaho bishoboka.
Everyone knows what to do.	Abantu bose bazi icyo gukora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, ibintu byose ni ukuri.
You can't try to do things.	Ntushobora kugerageza gukora ibintu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
I did what he said.	Nakoze ibyo yavuze.
I thought it was really good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza rwose.
He was expecting problems.	Yari yiteze ibibazo.
It is not an easy thing to live by.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye kubaho.
I know there is a lot to learn.	Nzi ko hari byinshi byo kwiga.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
This is not just an idea, it is a fact.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa, ibi nukuri.
And he is here with us.	Kandi ari hano hamwe natwe.
Sunday and schedule.	Ku cyumweru na gahunda.
'	'
I like things.	Nkunda ibintu.
She lives near him.	Aba hafi ye.
I want to make friends.	Ndashaka gushaka inshuti.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
He had to live well.	Yagombaga kubaho neza.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
But we must.	Ariko tugomba.
He said it was not now, never.	Yavuze ko atari ubu, nta na rimwe.
I was scared of him and me.	Nagize ubwoba kuri we no kuri njye.
But he never did.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze abikora.
Everyone.	Umuntu wese.
He can't do anything wrong.	Ntashobora gukora ikintu kibi.
He asked for help to leave.	Yasabye ubufasha bwo kugenda.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I thought quickly.	Natekereje vuba.
He thought he should not do this.	Yatekereje ko atagomba gukora ibi.
That's what you do when you're on top.	Nibyo ukora iyo uri hejuru.
The baby was beautiful.	Umwana yari mwiza.
And it’s probably just a coincidence.	Kandi birashoboka ko ari amahirwe gusa.
You can trust whatever you want.	Urashobora kwizera icyo ushaka cyose.
You have to stay.	Ugomba kuguma.
He speaks alone.	Avuga wenyine.
At the same time, you have to give up.	Igihe kimwe, ugomba kureka.
He is my best friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye nziza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
That he can be anyone he wants.	Ko ashobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese ashaka.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atabikoze.
Good thing !.	Ikintu cyiza!.
He wanted to quit his job.	Yashakaga kureka akazi.
There is a car.	Hariho imodoka.
One of us will do it.	Umwe muri twe azabikora.
He was happy to do something.	Yishimiye kugira icyo akora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
You want to be human.	Urashaka kuba umuntu.
You can't do much.	Ntushobora gukora byinshi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was great to come.	Byari byiza cyane kuza.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I want to win that day.	Ndashaka gutsinda uwo munsi.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
He saw her walking.	Yabonye agenda.
Apparently he didn't know where he was.	Biragaragara ko atari azi aho ari.
He was close to me, and that was enough.	Yari hafi yanjye, kandi ibyo byari bihagije.
I think so too.	Nanjye ndatekereza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You have to do it another time.	Ugomba kubikora ikindi gihe.
He could tell any girl that.	Yashoboraga kubwira umukobwa wese ibyo.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu ibi.
But we can't either.	Ariko ntidushobora kandi.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
No one had a phone.	Nta muntu wari ufite terefone.
If you think.	Niba utekereza.
He has a school.	Afite ishuri.
He never had a problem getting what he wanted.	Ntiyigeze agira ikibazo cyo kubona ibintu yashakaga.
I can't think straight.	Sinshobora gutekereza neza.
I did not know who he was.	Sinari nzi uwo ari we.
I was a young child.	Nari umwana muto.
He did not expect to speak.	Ntabwo yizeye kuvuga.
We were friends.	Twari inshuti.
I'm doing well on my own.	Ndimo gukora neza wenyine.
In fact, that is not always the case.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
It's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
However, he would not let his daughter go.	Ariko, ntiyari kureka umukobwa we.
He is.	Niwe.
I just wanted your time.	Nashakaga gusa umwanya wawe.
I feel the same way.	Ndumva ari kimwe.
I am a player.	Ndi umukinnyi.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje neza kuri icyo kibazo.
And this is not a good thing.	Kandi iki ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
You are a woman.	Uri umugore.
It’s a real gift.	Ni impano rwose.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I don't want to say goodbye.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga neza.
I was lucky, however.	Nagize amahirwe, ariko.
Good luck!	Amahirwe!
That's what one does.	Nibyo umuntu akora.
That's not what he wanted.	Ntabwo ari uko yashakaga.
She was probably her hair.	Birashoboka ko yari umusatsi we.
It's under.	Ni munsi ya.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza cyane kuri ibyo.
It worked really well.	Byagenze neza rwose.
I'm not sure why.	Ntabwo nzi neza impamvu ibyo.
This is a new house.	Iyi ni inzu nshya.
However, there was something he needed to do here before.	Ariko, hari ikintu yari akeneye gukora hano mbere.
He must know for sure.	Agomba kumenya neza.
I don't know exactly what happened.	Ntabwo nzi rwose uko byagenze.
I had a lot to do.	Nari mfite byinshi byo gukora.
He wanted to know what it was.	Yashakaga kumenya icyo aricyo.
Everyone has it today.	Umuntu wese afite muri iki gihe.
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka hano.
He was never there.	Ntiyigeze aho ari.
He was where he was.	Yari aho yari ari.
He is here every day.	Ari hano buri munsi akora.
But there is.	Ariko hariho.
I just wanted to go to the movies.	Nashakaga gusa kujya muri firime.
Her house was very nice.	Inzu ye yari nziza cyane.
I mean, it's great.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari nziza cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I should be one.	Nkwiye kuba umwe.
He should have worked harder.	Yari akwiye gukora cyane.
It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
I have to do the same.	Nanjye ngomba kubikora.
I have to get out of here.	Ngomba kuva hano.
I can't even be friends.	Sinshobora no kuba inshuti.
It wasn't good enough.	Ntabwo byari byiza bihagije.
Touching on abandonment together.	Gukora kuri kureka hamwe.
There is something else here.	Hari ikindi kintu hano.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
How to think.	Uburyo bwo gutekereza.
I believe in you.	Ndizera nawe.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
It is impossible to be here.	Ntabwo bishoboka ko hano.
They have the truth.	Bafite ukuri.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
I think about a lot.	Ntekereza kuri byinshi.
Really, really.	Nukuri, rwose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We just have to see.	Tugomba kubona gusa.
He thought he should.	Yatekereje ko agomba.
I was very tall.	Nari hejuru cyane.
If he was right, he wouldn't be here.	Niba yari afite ukuri, ntashobora kuguma hano.
I think he is here.	Ntekereza ko ari hano.
She is not a woman.	Ntabwo ari umugore.
It was good on time.	Byari byiza ku gihe.
But apparently he was.	Ariko biragaragara ko yari.
I also have occasionally.	Nanjye mfite rimwe na rimwe.
It was not far.	Ntiyari kure.
Something is up here.	Hano hari ikintu hejuru.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari muri byinshi.
None of us spoke.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wigeze avuga.
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	Gusa yari azi ko adashaka kuba wenyine.
He didn't know that and he didn't know why.	Ntabwo yari azi ibyo kandi ntabwo yari azi impamvu.
This would do nothing.	Ibi ntacyo byari gukora.
I want to stay in my house.	Ndashaka kuguma mu nzu yanjye.
It was time to play.	Byari igihe cyo gukina.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Can you think of anything ?.	Urashobora gutekereza ikintu cyose?.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Getting more.	Kubona byinshi.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You can't be.	Ntushobora kuba.
It’s a good idea to wait a bit.	Nibyiza gutegereza gato.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
I wanted to take the time.	Nashakaga gufata umwanya.
Probably not the best guy after all.	Birashoboka ko atari umusore mwiza nyuma ya byose.
They were nearby.	Bari hafi aho.
She is studying fast.	Ari kwiga vuba.
Where is he? 	Ari he?
I hope someone has something good.	Nizere ko umuntu afite ikintu cyiza.
Especially.	Cyane cyane.
I never saw a problem.	Nta kibazo nigeze mbona.
Much was true.	Byinshi byari ukuri.
Not that he did much.	Ntabwo ari uko yakoze byinshi.
I can't figure out what to do.	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya neza icyo gukora.
People were there.	Abantu bari aho.
Only, things went wrong.	Gusa, ibintu byagenze nabi.
I didn't have time.	Ntabwo nari mfite umwanya.
You can find out more here.	Urashobora kumenya byinshi hano.
No one has ever done that.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I'm here now.	Ndi hano ubu.
Where you can learn more about the program.	Aho ushobora kwiga byinshi kuri gahunda.
I understand why you should do this.	Ndumva impamvu ugomba gukora ibi.
But that was it.	Ariko byari uko.
It was just that.	Byari gusa.
I want you to be alone.	Ndashaka ko uri wenyine.
I don’t think it’s possible but it is possible.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko bishoboka ariko birashoboka.
It’s not a big deal for him to go.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe menshi kuri we yo kugenda.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
But he has problems.	Ariko afite ibibazo.
He just wanted to get back to work.	Yashakaga gusa gusubira ku kazi.
I knew it was just a matter of time.	Nari nzi ko ari ikibazo gusa.
Who.	Uwo.
You can tell from afar.	Urashobora kubwira kure.
You can learn more here.	Urashobora kwiga byinshi hano.
True or false.	Nukuri cyangwa ntabwo.
But the truth is something else.	Ariko ukuri ni ikindi kintu.
He came here yesterday	Yaje hano ejo
That day may come.	Uwo munsi urashobora kuza.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
I think he was right about that.	Ntekereza ko yari afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
It is better to find what you want.	Nibyiza gushaka icyo ushaka.
Or maybe together.	Cyangwa ahari hamwe.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
The truth.	Ukuri.
He chose to blame himself.	Yahisemo ko na we ari amakosa ye.
It's a long time.	Ni igihe kirekire.
But the woman was another matter.	Ariko umugore yari ikindi kibazo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Good family.	Umuryango mwiza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
It was a constant worry.	Byari impungenge buri gihe.
He is not a friend.	Ntabwo ari inshuti.
Never, never, never.	Nta na rimwe, nta na rimwe, nta na rimwe.
I believe that is true.	Ndizera ko ibyo ari ukuri.
I don't know who he is.	Ntazi uwo ari we.
That, too, was good.	Ibyo na byo byari byiza.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
He is not in this world.	Ntabwo ari kuri iyi si.
At that time he had.	Icyo gihe yari afite.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I feel right.	Numva ari ukuri.
One of the many.	Umwe muri benshi.
I saw it here.	Nabonye hano.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba ndi hano.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
And friends to all.	Kandi inshuti kuri bose.
He is working hard.	Arimo gukora cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo yari gukora.
And they were lucky.	Kandi bari bafite amahirwe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, byari bisanzwe kurenza ibi.
He saw.	Yabonye.
It's just that.	Ni ukuri gusa.
But he would not tell anyone.	Ariko ntabwo yari kubwira umuntu.
I can't find anything to do.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose cyo gukora.
He could have gone better.	Yashoboraga kugenda neza.
I'm sure this time.	Nzi neza ko iki gihe.
I thought he did.	Natekereje ko yabikoze.
I was three years old.	Nari mfite imyaka itatu.
I don’t want to go back to that.	Sinshaka gusubira kuri ibyo.
Obviously we have work to do.	Biragaragara ko dufite akazi ko gukora.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
Or not at all.	Cyangwa sibyo rwose.
She is a very active girl.	Ni umukobwa ukora cyane.
He tried well.	Yagerageje neza.
He was not my dog.	Ntabwo yari imbwa yanjye.
And he is a good friend.	Kandi ari inshuti nziza.
I like being here.	Nkunda kuba hano.
But you don’t have to live.	Ariko ntugomba kubaho.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
To win	Gutsinda.
We have to overcome that.	Tugomba gutsinda ibyo.
And it is not a book at all.	Kandi ntabwo ari igitabo icyo ari cyo cyose.
I saw a lot of things.	Nabonye ibintu byinshi.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
He went.	Yagiye.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I can't live like that.	Sinshobora kubaho gutya.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
It looks good on me.	Birasa neza kuri njye.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I don't know what you think.	Sinzi icyo utekereza.
Lower than lower, in fact.	Hasi kurenza hasi, mubyukuri.
His house is simple.	Inzu ye ni ibintu byoroshye.
He can drink.	Arashobora kunywa.
I don't need this.	Ntabwo nkeneye ibi.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
He is here.	Ari hano.
And very early on.	Kandi mbere cyane.
No one can.	Nta muntu ushobora.
There is nothing we can do about it today.	Nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora muri iki gihe.
He did not understand why he was there.	Ntiyigeze yumva impamvu yari ahari.
I can't live with him.	Sinshobora kubana na we.
.	.
There are many reasons for this.	Ahari hariho impamvu nyinshi.
I knew it would be good.	Nari nzi ko bizaba byiza.
You are not at work.	Ntabwo uri ku kazi.
I never thought of myself.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza kuri njye.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo byiza byiza '!.
I think he did something good.	Ntekereza ko yakoze ikintu cyiza.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
He was not sure what had happened.	Ntabwo yari azi neza uko byagenze.
If so, that's a good idea.	Niba aribyo, ni igitekerezo cyiza.
I don’t know why, but he.	Sinzi impamvu, ariko we.
But we.	Ariko twe.
He didn't know anyone, he never was there, he was gone.	Ntabwo yari azi umuntu, ntabwo yigeze ahari, yagiye.
It is not easy at all.	Ntabwo byoroshye rwose.
He did this easily, as if it were normal for him.	Ibi yabikoze byoroshye, nkaho byari bisanzwe kuri we.
I can't wait.	Sinshobora gutegereza.
But he accepted the truth.	Ariko yemeye ukuri.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
Please, man.	Nyamuneka, muntu.
We have to play well.	Tugomba gukina neza.
But he would not go.	Ariko ntiyari kugenda.
That is the same thing.	Icyo ni ikintu kimwe.
Stop talking.	Reka kuvuga.
I do not understand.	Ntabwo numva.
I hear the advice to come.	Ndumva inama yo kuza.
But he was still beautiful.	Ariko yari akiri mwiza.
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi.
Not on the phone.	Ntabwo ari kuri terefone.
We can't stay here.	Ntidushobora kuguma hano.
He needed to be.	Yari akeneye kuba.
I never thought you could do it.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ushobora kubikora.
I did it quickly.	Nakoze vuba.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
He said the man in the back.	Yavuze umuntu uri inyuma.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
But we had nothing to do with it.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe twari dufite cyo kubikora.
One time you have to act fast.	Igihe kimwe ugomba gukora vuba.
You can help.	Urashobora gufasha.
I really want to talk to you.	Ndashaka rwose kuvugana nawe.
I think that's enough.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bihagije.
That's a good thing.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
It will be soon.	Bizaba vuba.
Seeing people.	Kubona abantu.
That's not an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
He had a lot to say about it all.	Yari afite byinshi byo kuvuga kuri byose.
You have it in you.	Ufite muri wowe.
I know it's possible.	Nzi ko bishoboka.
He had something.	Yari afite ikintu.
Stay in.	Kuguma muri.
He wanted to know more about her.	Yashakaga kumenya byinshi kuri we.
You can only live.	Urashobora kubaho gusa.
Same with us.	Kimwe natwe.
He is now here.	Ubu ari hano.
Food.	Ibiryo.
I don't mean to say.	Ntashaka kuvuga.
'he said.	' yavuze.
You don't have to hear anything.	Ntugomba kumva ikintu na kimwe.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
It was good, too, once.	Byari byiza, kandi, rimwe.
She wants him to work alone.	Ashaka ko akora wenyine.
Or when we are scared.	Cyangwa iyo dufite ubwoba.
But you can't.	Ariko ntushobora.
I needed to go.	Nari nkeneye kugenda.
Everyone should know that by now.	Umuntu wese agomba kumenya ko kugeza ubu.
He saw what it was.	Yabonye icyo aricyo.
Okay, okay.	Nibyiza, neza.
You have to stay here with us.	Ugomba kuguma hano hamwe natwe.
Or you have to be.	Cyangwa ugomba kuba.
Children have nothing, nothing.	Abana ntacyo bafite, ntacyo.
If all goes well.	Niba ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I want to know the same thing.	Ndashaka kumenya ikindi kintu kimwe.
If you want to go, you have to go.	Niba ushaka kugenda, ugomba kugenda.
And with him when he goes.	Kandi hamwe na we iyo agiye.
What he meant.	Icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I can't.	Sinshobora.
I love this room.	Nkunda iki cyumba.
Leave the day.	Kureka umunsi.
What do you do	Ukora iki?
I wanted to see everything.	Nashakaga kubona byose.
That would have gone away.	Ibyo byari kugenda.
In fact, that was not the case.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
He did it on his own.	Yabikoze wenyine.
Do you know where this was?	Waba uzi aho ibi byari?
And soon.	Kandi vuba.
We all have one.	Twese dufite umwe.
For me.	Kuri njye.
I want to be something.	Ndashaka kuba ikintu.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
We have a gift.	Dufite impano.
This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
Probably not too bad.	Birashoboka ko atari mubi cyane.
We were early.	Twari kare.
The food is great here.	Ibiryo ni byiza cyane hano.
More than the outside.	Byinshi kuruta hanze.
Who can help please ???.	Ninde ushobora gufasha nyamuneka ???.
It's good to read.	Ni byiza gusoma.
So far he is doing very well.	Kugeza ubu akora neza rwose.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
He did not know if this was true or not.	Ntabwo yari azi niba ibyo byari ukuri cyangwa atari byo.
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
I don't believe in anything.	Nta na kimwe nizera.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi nibyo aribyo byose.
He was a very bad boy.	Yari umwana mubi cyane.
He can never be younger.	Ntashobora kongera kuba muto.
You need this.	Ukeneye ibi.
It would have been so easy.	Byari kuba byoroshye cyane.
That's it.	Ndi uwo.
No play.	Nta gukina.
Trying to understand how.	Kugerageza kumva uburyo.
This was a great day.	Uyu wari umunsi mwiza.
This is true when you need to know more.	Ibi ni ukuri mugihe ugomba kumenya neza.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
To me, it was good.	Kuri njye, yari mwiza.
After he left.	Amaze kugenda.
Another thing to do.	Ikindi kintu cyo gukora.
I was in everything.	Nari muri byose.
He was still scared.	Kugeza ubu yari afite ubwoba.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But he was good to her.	Ariko yari mwiza kuri we.
I think they know you're close.	Ntekereza ko bazi ko uri hafi.
They are not just children.	Ntabwo ari abana gusa.
I know he was.	Nzi ko yari.
There are many of them.	Hariho benshi muri we.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nukuri iki kibazo.
It will not be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza.
I love both together.	Nkunda bombi hamwe.
They know what they know.	Bazi ibyo bazi.
You have to study at home.	Ugomba kwiga murugo.
He thought he was right.	Yatekereje ko yari afite ukuri.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
But.	Ariko.
There is a lot of money involved here.	Hano hari amafaranga menshi arimo.
I am very close.	Ndi hafi cyane.
I had the opportunity to play once a week.	Nagize amahirwe yo gukina rimwe mu cyumweru.
I have to go, you said.	Ngomba kugenda, wavuze.
As you are	Nkuko uri.
This time he had to do it right.	Iki gihe yagombaga kubikora neza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But I don't know how to stop work.	Ariko ntazi guhagarika akazi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He had to study hard.	Yari akwiye kwiga cyane.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
But they are not just people.	Ariko ntabwo ari abantu gusa.
I thought about the house.	Natekereje ku nzu.
he is talking.	arimo avuga.
You like movies.	Ukunda firime.
Did you know that there is.	Wari uzi ko ahari.
He wanted to be here today.	Yashakaga kuba hano uyu munsi.
I want to hear everything you can say to me.	Ndashaka kumva ibyo ushobora kumbwira byose.
If anyone can help, it would be great.	Niba hari ushobora gufasha, byaba byiza.
He asked if he wanted to go.	Yabajije niba ashaka kujyana.
It's close.	Ari hafi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He has done well all the time until recently.	Yakoze neza igihe cyose kugeza vuba aha.
I want to try.	Ndashaka kugerageza.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
This was a lot for him.	Ibi byari byinshi kuri we.
I can't go back now.	Ntashobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
That's right- this is not about me.	Ntabwo aribyo, ntabwo aribyo.
To go	Kugenda.
In my opinion, there are many things.	Njye mbona, hari ibintu byinshi.
Niki.	Niki.
Niki.	Niki.
I didn't find it easy.	Ntabwo nabonye ibyo byoroshye.
He was not a good person.	Ntiyari umuntu mwiza.
He went.	Yagiye.
She thought that would be her.	Yatekereje ko ibyo byari kuba ari we.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It's good to have a lot of things you need.	Nibyiza ko hari ibintu byinshi ukeneye.
Not everyone is lucky.	Ntabwo abantu bose bafite amahirwe.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
My son started school.	Umwana wanjye yatangiye ishuri.
It is up to us.	Ni kuri twe.
The worst part was that he had the truth.	Ikintu kibi cyane muri byo ni uko yari afite ukuri.
It's really good.	Mubyukuri ni byiza.
Is everything ok 	Byose ni byiza?
What should you do?	Ukwiye gukora iki?
Not much, in fact.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, mubyukuri.
It's at work.	Ni ku kazi.
It's all.	Ni byose.
Out with you, now.	Hanze nawe, ubu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But it will be here soon.	Ariko bizaba hano vuba aha.
I was just thinking.	Natekerezaga gusa.
I think so.	Ndatekereza kuba.
If you can live with that, that's fine.	Niba ushobora kubana nibyo, nibyiza.
And it's easy.	Kandi byoroshye.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I am very far away.	Ndi kure cyane.
And there is a problem.	Kandi hariho ikibazo.
You don’t even have to think about how to be bad.	Ntugomba no gutekereza uburyo bwo kuba mubi.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
I like to talk.	Nkunda kuvuga.
You may have problems.	Urashobora kugira ibibazo.
But he is not far off.	Ariko ntabwo afite kure.
I hadn't told anyone.	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nabwiye.
Walking was difficult.	Kugenda byari bigoye.
He would not be there.	Ntabwo yari kuba ahari.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He went alone.	Yagiye wenyine.
No one is out.	Nta muntu uri hanze.
He was the right person.	Yari umuntu ukwiye.
They are here.	Bari hano.
I like it a lot later.	Nkunda byinshi nyuma.
Niki! 	Niki!
It looks like here.	Birasa hano.
Out front.	Hanze imbere.
It didn't always work out.	Ntabwo buri gihe byagenze neza.
A boy or a girl?	Umuhungu cyangwa umukobwa?
He told the truth for the first time.	Yavuze ukuri bwa mbere.
I haven't seen it since.	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona.
No one is around.	Nta muntu uri hafi.
I love my dog.	Nkunda imbwa yanjye.
As he had.	Nkuko yari afite.
I needed to work.	Nari nkeneye gukora.
He is the only person.	Ni umuntu wenyine.
That’s what my friend used to say.	Nibyo inshuti yanjye yakundaga kuvuga.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
Same idea.	Igitekerezo kimwe.
She really wants to be with him.	Arashaka rwose kubana na we.
He did not need to be with her.	Ntiyari akeneye kubana na we.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I don't know how old he is.	Sinzi imyaka afite.
Or you want to work.	Cyangwa ushaka gukora.
Of course, we can't do anything about it.	Nibyo, ntidushobora gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
But you can do it.	Ariko urashobora kubikora.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo mubyukuri.
Meal time	Igihe cyo kurya.
You are going to be beautiful.	Ugiye kuba mwiza.
I had a great day.	Nagize umunsi mwiza.
I'm lucky.	Mfite amahirwe.
I think you did.	Ndatekereza ko wabikoze.
Eventually it came to him.	Amaherezo yaje kuri we.
But now he is gone.	Ariko ubu yagiye.
They were many.	Bari benshi.
He looked at one.	Yarebye kuri umwe.
He found a woman he loved.	Yabonye umugore yakundaga.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
Being a film actor is an opportunity.	Kuba umukinnyi wa firime ni amahirwe.
This is my favorite son.	Uyu ni umuhungu wanjye nkunda.
That was not all I did.	Ntabwo byari ibyo nkora gusa.
It finally came.	Amaherezo yaje.
He was not sure what to do now.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo gukora ubu.
She loves children.	Akunda abana.
You can do whatever you want.	Urashobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
Good stuff here.	Ibintu byiza hano.
Or anyone.	Cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Why a good question.	Kuki ikibazo cyiza.
All in all, this time.	Byose, iki gihe.
You are not a human being at all.	Ntabwo uri umuntu rwose.
I never heard of a problem.	Sinigeze numva ikibazo.
At that time I did not know.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi.
I was really lucky.	Nagize amahirwe rwose.
And in a short time, he had.	Kandi mu gihe gito, yari afite.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari kuba byiza.
Tell me what you want.	Mbwira icyo ushaka.
I don't know how.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo.
But he had not come.	Ariko ntabwo yari yaje.
He started thinking about leaving.	Yatangiye gutekereza ku kugenda.
Until recently, no one knew who he was.	Kugeza vuba aha, nta muntu numwe wari uzi uwo ari we.
I had a daughter to help.	Nari mfite umukobwa wo gufasha.
I think it's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
My youngest daughter.	Umukobwa wanjye muto.
I need money to buy food.	Nkeneye amafaranga yo kugura ibiryo.
I mean the same thing, though.	Ndashaka kuvuga ikintu kimwe, ariko.
I knew what it was.	Nari nzi icyo ari cyo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I think he is right.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri.
But this one looks really good.	Ariko ibi birasa neza mubyukuri.
There are people.	Hariho abantu.
But that is sometimes the case.	Ariko ibyo rimwe na rimwe.
I would not return.	Sinari gutaha.
Someone did it.	Umuntu yabikoze.
I'm not walking away from you.	Ntabwo ndimo kugenda kure yawe.
And it’s not just an idea.	Kandi ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa.
It's good for me.	Ni mwiza kuri njye.
There is something else to say.	Hariho ikindi kintu cyo kuvuga.
It is something that one can or cannot do.	Ni ikintu umuntu ashobora gukora cyangwa adashobora gukora.
I think about this difficult one.	Ntekereza kuri ibi bigoye.
Maybe there was something he could know about her.	Ahari hariho ibintu yashoboraga kumenya kuri we.
He had faith.	Yari afite kwizera.
I can't have this in my house.	Sinshobora kugira ibi mu nzu yanjye.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
Everything you love.	Ibyo ukunda byose.
She was no longer just a beautiful girl.	Ntabwo yari akiri umukobwa mwiza gusa.
Just one thing.	Ikintu gusa.
He just thought he had it.	Yatekereje gusa ko afite.
At home.	Murugo.
The party was a celebration of victory.	Ibirori byari ibirori byo gutsinda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko atari yagiye kure bihagije.
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
He will be three years old.	Azaba afite imyaka itatu.
Everything he said was true.	Ibyo yavuze byose byari ukuri.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
And sometimes that is true.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe ibyo ni ukuri.
But there was something else he said.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu yavuze.
He is indeed a man, and all of us.	Nukuri kandi ni umuntu, natwe twese.
But.	Ariko.
Time is of the essence.	Igihe ni kinini.
It was easy.	Byari ibintu byoroshye.
That’s great for most of us.	Nibyiza cyane kuri benshi muri twe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He was ready for anything.	Yari yiteguye ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
Do you want to go with me?	Urashaka kujyana nanjye?
They have faith.	Bafite kwizera.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birasa nkaho yakoze neza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Good advice.	Inama nziza.
For me, it was normal.	Kuri njye, byari ibintu bisanzwe.
If it weren’t for him, he wouldn’t have done it.	Niba atari we, ntabwo yari kubikora.
No work to do.	Nta kazi ko gukora.
I never heard anyone say why.	Sinigeze numva umuntu avuga impamvu.
I guess you have what you want now.	Ndakeka yuko ubu ufite icyo ushaka.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It finally came.	Amaherezo yaje.
Normal good things.	Ibintu byiza bisanzwe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Now is the time to work.	Ubu ni igihe cyo gukora.
Only your money, and that's it.	Amafaranga yawe gusa, kandi nibyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
I couldn't do it now.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kubikora ubu.
They have a plan.	Bafite gahunda.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ibintu gusa.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
He is in his room.	Ari mu cyumba cye.
I know where they are.	Nzi aho bari.
I don't want anything.	Ntacyo nshaka.
You can have it.	Urashobora kugira.
He said that would be nice.	Yavuze ko ibyo byaba byiza.
He will definitely do it on this issue.	Kuri iki kibazo rwose azabikora.
I'm just a person.	Ndi umuntu gusa.
All of us.	Twese.
He and he.	We na we hamwe.
This is not easy for me.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye kuri njye.
I can do anything.	Nshobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
To.	Kuri.
Eat together	Kurya hamwe.
But not all.	Ariko si byose.
They are on him and in him.	Bari kuri we no muri we.
As if he never wanted anything.	Nkuko atigeze ashaka ikintu na kimwe.
I need a job.	Nkeneye akazi.
That's not the case today.	Ntabwo aribyo uyu munsi.
'	'
But there are many things.	Ariko hariho ibintu byinshi.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
You have it all.	Ufite byose.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
But he meant the same thing.	Ariko yashakaga kuvuga ikintu kimwe.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
For one.	Kuri kimwe.
You are his friend, and you can do whatever you want.	Uri inshuti ye, kandi ushobora gukora ibyo utekereza neza.
He took his time.	Yafashe igihe cye.
He does it in a short time.	Abikora mu gihe gito.
He needed a lot of money.	Yari akeneye amafaranga menshi.
Or, it seems.	Cyangwa, birasa.
I want to talk to you today.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe uyu munsi.
He was sitting alone.	Yari yicaye wenyine.
I know her children.	Nzi abana be.
I'm behind you, man.	Ndi inyuma yawe, muntu.
He could have seen one guy.	Yashoboraga kubona umusore umwe.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
I'm not sure what happened.	Sinzi neza uko byagenze.
I can't believe he's doing it so fast.	Sinshobora kwizera ko akora vuba.
But that is probably the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko aribyo.
Why can't he do something about it? 	Kuki adashobora kugira icyo akora?
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
Or under him.	Cyangwa munsi ye.
He would not go far.	Ntabwo yari kujya kure.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I needed to talk to you.	Nari nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
But that's right.	Ariko ibyo ni byo.
Things are not right.	Ibintu ntabwo aribyo.
He asked questions.	Yabajije ibibazo.
One thing is for sure.	Ikintu kimwe hariho umwe gusa.
The housewife was young.	Umugore wo murugo yari akiri muto.
He will never do that.	Ntazigera abikora.
You can definitely.	Urashobora rwose.
No one is behind.	Nta muntu uri inyuma.
I see nothing wrong.	Nta kibi mbona.
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
He said he thought.	Yavuze ko yatekereje.
She is young and beautiful.	Ari muto kandi mwiza.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
This is true.	Ibi nibyo.
Every day is possible.	Buri munsi birashoboka.
It was early in the morning.	Icyo gihe hari mu gitondo cya kare.
We needed.	Twari dukeneye.
Lots of things here.	Ibintu byinshi hano.
We need to know what to do.	Tugomba kumenya icyo gukora.
I was looking for money.	Nashakaga amafaranga.
But sometimes he was lucky.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe yagize amahirwe.
Only this.	Gusa ibi.
You need help.	Ukeneye ubufasha.
He knew what he meant.	Yari azi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
The idea and the request were simple.	Igitekerezo no gusaba byari byoroshye.
I needed a car.	Nari nkeneye imodoka.
He was probably a man after all.	Birashoboka ko yari umuntu nyuma ya byose.
I have to see this.	Ngomba kubona ibi.
I need to think.	Nkeneye gutekereza.
We have a daughter.	Dufite umukobwa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I'm glad that.	Nishimiye ibyo.
Being human is good.	Kuba umuntu ni byiza.
I was a problem.	Nari ikibazo.
You are doing well.	Urimo ukora neza.
I just don't know how to do it.	Gusa sinzi kubikora.
Being here now.	Kuba hano ubu.
I have to drive.	Ngomba gutwara.
Is it okay?	Nibyiza?.
In fact, they have nothing.	Mubyukuri, nta kintu na kimwe bafite.
You were a family.	Wari umuryango.
But that is a small thing.	Ariko icyo ni ikintu gito.
You can find a lot of hard stuff from here.	Urashobora kubona byinshi bigoye kuva hano.
I was up early in the morning.	Nari kare kare mu gitondo.
I understand exactly what you mean.	Ndumva neza icyo ushaka kuvuga.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I am very worried.	Mfite impungenge cyane.
Probably, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka.
Everything was fine, everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza, byose byari byiza.
Who do you like the most ?.	Ninde ukunda cyane?.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
I have good things.	Mfite ibintu byiza.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
He tried to speak.	Yagerageje kuvuga.
I hope it will.	Ndizera ko bizaba.
I was bad too.	Nanjye nari mubi.
He knew in that look that he was alone.	Muri ibyo yari azi ko ari wenyine.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
The guy looked good.	Umusore yarebye neza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But there is a catch.	Ariko hariho gufata.
I don't feel like work.	Ntabwo numva ari akazi.
It is also possible to do the same thing tomorrow, too.	Birashoboka kandi gukora ikintu kimwe ejo, kandi.
She wants a baby.	Ashaka umwana.
Recently it is up.	Vuba aha ni hejuru.
He wanted to know more about her.	Yashakaga kumenya byinshi kuri we.
You are reading this carefully.	Urimo gusoma ibi neza.
I understand, however.	Ndumva ariko.
I guess close enough is good enough.	Ndakeka ko hafi bihagije nibyiza bihagije.
It would be.	Byaba.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
I can work on it.	Nshobora gukora kuri yo.
You want	Urashaka.
I think this is a good thing.	Ntekereza ko iki ari ikintu cyiza.
There is so much to see.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona.
He seems to know a lot about her.	Asa nkaho azi byinshi kuri we.
That is not easy.	Ibyo ntabwo byoroshye.
The food was good.	Ibiryo byari byiza.
Living with me.	Kubana nanjye.
And it was probably true.	Kandi birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
Truth is not the only thing.	Ukuri ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe gusa.
He was happy to tell me.	Yishimiye kumbwira.
Either way, I don’t like it.	Muri ibyo aribyo byose, ntabwo nkunda.
And he probably needed help.	Kandi birashoboka ko yari akeneye ubufasha.
He did something.	Hari icyo yakoze.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
Here.	Hano.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
We can't make mistakes.	Ntidushobora gufata amakosa.
All together	Byose hamwe.
She thought she was so beautiful.	Yatekereje ko ari mwiza cyane.
I think it is now.	Ntekereza ko ari ubu.
His father had gone.	Se yari yagiye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza, nibyo.
You can find children in school.	Urashobora kubona abana mwishuri.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
I haven't thought about it until recently.	Ntabwo natekereje kuri byo kugeza vuba aha.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
When it's hard they don't really know what to do.	Iyo bigoye ntabwo rwose bazi icyo gukora.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
I'm going to buy another one of those.	Ngiye kugura ikindi kimwe muri ibyo.
He never did what he wanted to do.	Ntiyigeze akora ikintu yashakaga gukora.
It was a little better.	Byari byiza gato.
He has no phone.	Nta terefone afite.
You have to do something yourself.	Ugomba gukora ikintu wenyine.
I even realized that at the time.	Nigeze no kubona ko icyo gihe.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
She is very embarrassed.	Afite isoni cyane.
Until.	Kugeza kuri.
He says he does.	Avuga ko abikora.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
You can hear everything.	Urashobora kumva byose.
If you want.	Niba ushaka.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
Someone had to do it.	Umuntu yagombaga kubikora.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
He says this is a very good thing.	Avuga ko ibi ari ibintu byiza cyane.
You can't have many friends.	Ntushobora kugira inshuti nyinshi.
It was not a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo.
You should have found my house.	Wari ukwiye kubona inzu yanjye.
The problem is money.	Ikibazo ni amafaranga.
I just did.	Nakoze gusa.
The problem is.	Ikibazo ni.
She was beautiful, very beautiful.	Yari mwiza, mwiza cyane.
But there is a chance.	Ariko hari amahirwe.
That person is smart.	Uwo muntu afite ubwenge.
Who do you like	Ninde ukunda?
It is not wise.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge.
He needed help and urgency.	Yari akeneye ubufasha kandi vuba.
I don't know why, but it's true.	Sinzi impamvu, ariko ni ukuri.
I know who he is.	Nzi uwo ari we.
I did nothing.	Ntacyo nakoze.
He is pleased that this has happened.	Yishimiye ko byagenze neza.
Bomb, bomb.	Bombi, bombi.
No down time.	Nta gihe cyo hasi.
Walking alone.	Kugenda wenyine.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
It is now.	Ubu ni.
You have your money.	Ufite amafaranga yawe.
But he didn't know what else to do.	Ariko ntabwo yari azi ikindi gukora.
I shouldn't do this.	Ntabwo nkwiye gukora ibi.
Maybe a bad person.	Ahari umuntu mubi.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
That's exactly what happened yesterday.	Nibyo rwose ejo.
He seemed to be.	Yasaga naho.
Especially living together.	Cyane cyane kubana.
You?	Wowe?
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
He was very young, he had simple things.	Yari muto cyane, afite ibintu byoroshye.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
You don't know exactly what happened.	Ntabwo uzi neza uko byagenze.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
I don't think so.	Ntekereza ko ibi atari byo.
I wanted to do the same.	Nashakaga gukora kimwe.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
It's almost here.	Ari hafi hano.
I think he feels good.	Ntekereza ko yumva ari byiza.
More than that.	Kurenza.
Never.	Nta na rimwe.
Many people have this problem.	Abantu benshi bafite iki kibazo.
He watched for a long time.	Yarebye igihe kirekire.
It's one time.	Ni umwanya umwe.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
I love what he does.	Nkunda ibyo akora.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
Please help.	Nyamuneka ukeneye ubufasha.
I know it's easier said than done.	Nzi ko byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
We don't need help.	Ntabwo dukeneye ubufasha.
He did not know exactly when.	Ntabwo yari azi neza igihe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Most are not good.	Byinshi ntabwo ari byiza.
Tomorrow is my day.	Ejo ni umunsi wanjye.
I wanted to try and catch up.	Nashakaga kugerageza no gufata.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You can't do that now.	Ntushobora kubikora nonaha.
I just wanted to.	Nashakaga gusa.
It was human.	Byari umuntu.
Someone you can talk to.	Umuntu ushobora kuvugana.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.

Absolutely now.	Ubu rwose.
Where did he go?	Yagiye he?
At the time, he did not know what to expect.	Icyo gihe, ntabwo yari azi icyo agomba gutegereza.

Let's do it.	Reka reka.
Or he can't.	Cyangwa ntashobora.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
Everything was great all the time.	Ibintu byose byari byiza cyane igihe cyose.
And he was ready soon.	Kandi yari yiteguye vuba.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo.
It's good to win.	Nibyiza gutsinda.
And it was easy to do.	Kandi byari byoroshye gukora.
Sometimes he does.	Rimwe na rimwe abikora.

But he thought it might be you.	Ariko yatekereje ko ashobora kuba wowe.

He needs a car.	Akeneye imodoka.
Now he is gone.	Ubu yagiye.

I can't ask for more.	Sinshobora gusaba byinshi.
Apparently someone had.	Biragaragara ko umuntu yari afite.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Ibyo biragaragara neza.
And he was absolutely scared.	Kandi yari afite ubwoba rwose.
And he had.	Kandi yari afite.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
You know your child well.	Uzi umwana wawe neza.

There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
He tried to think of something.	Yagerageje gutekereza ku kintu na kimwe.
Only one did.	Umwe gusa ni we wabikoze.
There is one child, a boy.	Hariho umwana umwe, umuhungu.
I can have.	Nshobora kugira.
He didn't have to do it.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubikora.
They were nothing to me.	Ntacyo bari cyo kuri njye.
He did as he pleased.	Yakoze uko ashaka.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
You know nothing about him.	Ntacyo uzi kuri we.
I could never do that.	Sinigeze nshobora kubikora.
And that's what you're going for.	Kandi nibyo ugiye.
I knew exactly what to do.	Nari nzi neza icyo gukora.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
So far I can't stop anything.	Kugeza ubu ntashobora guhagarika ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I now have a house.	Ubu mfite inzu.
Do you want to be together?	Urashaka kubana?
These are people.	Aba ni abantu.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
This whole thing.	Iki kintu cyose.
You are reading a book.	Urimo gusoma igitabo.
John knew his wife.	Yohana yari azi umugore we.
I don’t want him to go.	Sinshaka ko agenda.
The idea is not true.	Igitekerezo ntabwo ari ukuri.
However, you have another problem.	Ariko, ufite ikindi kibazo.
I am a woman.	Ndi umugore.
It was his house.	Yari inzu ye.
I saw.	Nabonye.

Stop going.	Reka kugenda.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He will be here too.	Na we azaba hano.
He didn't know the money.	Ntabwo yari azi amafaranga.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You have to do it if he doesn't.	Ugomba kubikora niba atabikoze.
He doesn't like help.	Ntabwo akunda ubufasha.
Things were really good.	Ibintu byari byiza rwose.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
And everything went well.	Kandi ibintu byose byagenze neza.
It is not a good time for me.	Ntabwo ari umwanya mwiza kuri njye.
In the beginning.	Ni kare.
He can't drive.	Ntashobora gutwara.
It's a party.	Ni ibirori.
He did it before like.	Yabikoze mbere nka.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He did not know where.	Ntiyari azi aho.
He looked away quickly.	Yarebye kure vuba.
You should be too.	Nawe ugomba kuba.
I guess so are we.	Ndakeka yuko natwe turi.
I think so.	Ndatekereza ko.
The whole family.	Umuryango wose.
Much of it actually.	Byinshi mubyukuri.
It was my fault.	Byari amakosa yanjye.
But it may not be easy.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari ibintu byoroshye.
He thought they were close.	Yatekerezaga ko bari hafi.
I'm not sure why, but it's possible.	Sinzi neza impamvu ibyo, ariko birashoboka.
Being very close.	Kuba hafi cyane.
If you are.	Niba muri.
I didn't have one.	Ntabwo nari mfite.
I need to be away from here.	Nkeneye kuba kure hano.
They don’t know exactly what to expect.	Ntabwo bazi neza icyo ugomba gutegereza.
He wants your family.	Ashaka umuryango wawe.
I'm going to see a movie.	Ngiye kureba firime.
I just want to be alone.	Ndashaka gusa kuba wenyine.
Not years.	Ntabwo ari imyaka.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It’s something he never thought of before.	Ni ikintu atigeze atekereza mbere.
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I can make this as simple or difficult as possible.	Nshobora gukora ibi byoroshye cyangwa bigoye bishoboka.
Nothing to buy.	Nta kintu cyo kugura.
They had nothing.	Nta na kimwe bari bafite.
He wanted to study.	Yashakaga kwiga.
He came later.	Yaje nyuma.
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko.
I was very close.	Nari hafi cyane.
I can live on that for a long, long time.	Nshobora kubaho kuri ibyo igihe kirekire, kirekire.
Someone was inside.	Umuntu yari imbere.
Maybe a little.	Ahari gato.
We can't do this.	Ibi ntidushobora gukora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I should be.	Nkwiye kuba.
I'm glad you're around.	Nishimiye ko uri hafi.
This was a great day.	Uyu rwose wari umunsi mwiza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
To me this is not wise.	Kuri njye ibi ntabwo ari ubwenge.
Not really scary.	Ntabwo rwose ari ubwoba.
I don’t know how that is.	Sinzi uburyo ibyo aribyo.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byari byagenze neza.
Someone was nice.	Umuntu wari mwiza.
He started drinking a lot.	Yatangiye kunywa cyane.
He thought I was now.	Yatekereje ko ubu ndimo.
I'm going to do something good.	Ngiye gukora ikintu cyiza.
Just one thing for us to do.	Ikintu kimwe gusa kuri twe gukora.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza kubona.
My son is gone.	Umuhungu wanjye yagiye.
You don’t even have to think.	Ntugomba no gutekereza.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi neza ko adashobora kumva neza.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
'	'
And at that point.	Kandi muri icyo gihe.
He is absolutely right.	Avuga ukuri rwose.
Things were simple.	Ibintu byari byoroshye.
He started drinking.	Yatangiye kunywa.
Each of us.	Buri wese muri twe.
You have to be.	Ugomba kuba.
This one was not close.	Uyu ntiyari hafi.
It was going well.	Byari byagenze neza.
There was a time when he was in her.	Hari igihe yari no muri we.
She is not his daughter.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa we.
You are not what you are.	Ntabwo uri icyo aricyo.
He had done something.	Hari icyo yari yakoze.
He can go.	Arashobora kugenda.
It is a beautiful house.	Ni inzu nziza.
I can't feel any of that inside.	Sinshobora kumva kimwe muri byo imbere.
These are children.	Aba ni abana.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
And he was not alone.	Kandi ntabwo yari wenyine.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
He thinks that's something.	Yibwira ko icyo ari ikintu.
The boy is here.	Umuhungu ari hano.
We are human.	Turi umuntu.
But that is me.	Ariko uwo ni njye.
Na se.	Na se.
I knew what.	Nari nzi icyo.
But it’s not hard to work alone.	Ntabwo ariko bigoye gukora wenyine.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo byose.
And this is true.	Kandi ibi ni ukuri.
Please let me know.	Nyamuneka nyamuneka reka.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I need to know what happened.	Nkeneye kumenya uko byagenze.
Someone would have gone.	Umuntu yaba yagiye.
The little girl made new friends.	Umukobwa muto yagize inshuti nshya.
In his time, he looked good.	Mu gihe we, yasaga neza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza nyuma ya byose.
I saw the bus from a distance.	Nabonye bisi kure.
Can you help?	Urashobora gufasha?
I had no plans.	Nta gahunda nari mfite.
He had this.	Yari afite ibi.
A lot of time to think.	Igihe kinini cyo gutekereza.
You.	Wowe.
He hadn't gone very far.	Ntabwo yari yagiye kure cyane.
I can't trust anyone.	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera umuntu uwo ari we wese.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He was right.	Yari kuri.
You have to make sure you have everything.	Ugomba kumenya neza ko ufite byose.
You are one of the most beautiful girls.	Uri umukobwa umwe mwiza cyane.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
One of us has to talk!	Umwe muri twe agomba kuvuga!
You do everything you need to do.	Ukora ibyo ugomba gukora byose.
He could see everything now.	Yashoboraga kubona byose ubu.
He seemed to know what to do.	Yasaga naho azi icyo gukora.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
You have to go back.	Ugomba gusubira inyuma.
Very close and nice.	Hafi cyane kandi nziza.
They are children.	Ni abana.
That's exactly what happened for a long time.	Nibyo rwose mubyukuri igihe kinini.
That's right.	Iyo mu kuri.
I didn't really think about it.	Ntabwo rwose natekerezaga neza.
It was once low, however.	Yigeze kuba hasi rimwe, ariko.
Stop eating.	Kureka kurya.
We are friends too.	Natwe turi inshuti.
Maybe that would be nice.	Ahari ibyo byaba byiza.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
I know what he looks like.	Nzi uko asa.
And he may have been right.	Kandi ashobora kuba yari afite ukuri.
He was not ready to return.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye gutaha.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga rwose.
Always have a phone.	Kugira terefone buri gihe.
That's when he said.	Icyo gihe ni bwo yavuze.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
The woman was of no use to him.	Umugore ntacyo yari amaze kuri we.
He did it while eating.	Yabikoze mu gihe cyo kurya.
I don't want children.	Sinshaka abana.
And it won’t be.	Kandi ntabwo bizaba.
Or in fact, the problem.	Cyangwa mubyukuri, ikibazo.
He had a friend.	Yari afite inshuti.
You said good things.	Wavuze ibintu byiza.
And, he probably has the truth.	Kandi, birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
Maybe it was a mistake.	Ahari byari amakosa.
No one is in front of him.	Nta muntu uri imbere ye.
He did not know exactly when.	Ntiyari azi neza igihe icyo ari cyo.
That's exactly what we're here for.	Nibyo rwose turi hano.
You have problems and need help.	Ufite ibibazo kandi ukeneye ubufasha.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It was a worry.	Byari impungenge.
The car was very low.	Imodoka yari hasi cyane.
I'm happy here.	Nishimiye hano.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ari ukuri.
I don't know why.	Ntazi impamvu.
But what she could think of was him.	Ariko icyo yashoboraga gutekereza ni we.
Honestly, it was actually something.	Nyamuneka, mubyukuri yari ikintu.
He had time.	Yari afite umwanya.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
More on this tomorrow.	Byinshi kuri ibi ejo.
It was not very good.	Ntiyari mwiza cyane.
That you were my friend, that's right.	Ko wari inshuti yanjye, nibyo.
It is not his fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
And he had.	Kandi yari afite.
I don’t want to wait too long.	Sinshaka gutegereza hafi.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
In fact, it is not.	Mu kuri, ntabwo.
It's early and it's not easy.	Ni kare kandi ntabwo byoroshye.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
But we can't.	Ariko ntidushobora.
I can't stay here.	Ntashobora kuguma hano.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
You can't be good.	Ntushobora kuba mwiza.
We just have to live with that.	Tugomba gusa kubana nibyo.
In fact, so many.	Mubyukuri, benshi cyane.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
And let it be.	Kandi reka.
Eat what you want.	Kurya icyo ushaka.
You are a teacher.	Uri umwarimu.
I'm so glad you're here.	Nishimiye cyane uwo urimo kuba.
I can walk all the time.	Nshobora kugenda buri gihe.
He had his place.	Yari afite umwanya we.
I never believed.	Sinigeze nizera.
He wanted to see more of it.	Yashakaga kureba byinshi muri byo.
He doesn't do things right.	Ntabwo akora ibintu neza.
Apparently he did.	Biragaragara ko yabikoze.
And if not him.	Niba kandi atari we.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
Apparently he was gone.	Biragaragara ko yari yagiye.
You have time.	Ufite umwanya.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
That is not difficult.	Ibyo ntabwo bigoye.
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
I think it's scary.	Ntekereza ko ari ubwoba.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
This is possible today.	Ibi birashoboka uyu munsi.
You have to be.	Ugomba kuba.
Now I believe he was right.	Ubu ndizera ko yari afite ukuri.
It was you.	Wari wowe.
He had an idea.	Yari afite igitekerezo.
I don't think that's what he wanted.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aricyo yashakaga.
I like work.	Nkunda akazi.
No one to talk to.	Nta muntu wo kuvugana.
Probably close.	Birashoboka ko ari hafi.
He may be alone.	Ashobora kuba wenyine.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
He could do anything.	Yashoboraga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
What you said	Ibyo wavuze.
I did not do well.	Sinigeze nkora neza.
But maybe you have too.	Ariko birashoboka ko nawe ufite.
The way you see it you can play with.	Uburyo bwo kubona ushobora gukina.
And that was enough.	Kandi ibyo byari bihagije.
No one said anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira icyo avuga.
Now he was about to talk to you.	Ubu yari hafi kuvugana nawe.
He tried for the last time.	Yagerageje bwa nyuma.
She is worried.	Afite impungenge.
What he did.	Ibyo yakoze.
I doubt he is right.	Ndashidikanya ko afite ukuri.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
That's what he says here.	Nibyo avuga hano.
Or money.	Cyangwa amafaranga.
You, that's right.	Wowe, nibyo.
He never liked this.	Ntabwo yigeze akunda ibi.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
Especially living together.	Cyane cyane kubana.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
You need to know how to do it.	Ugomba kumenya kubikora.
But I can't do that.	Ariko sinshobora kubikora.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose ari ukuri.
I can't read this.	Ntabwo nshobora gusoma ibi.
In fact, things were difficult.	Mubyukuri, ibintu byari bigoye.
He feels like her.	Yumva ari nka we.
These are the things we have to say.	Ibi ni ibintu tugomba kuvuga.
You are saying something else now.	Urimo kuvuga ikindi kintu ubu.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu cyiza.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
That’s good advice.	Iyo ni inama nziza.
At the time, however, he was not alone.	Icyo gihe ariko, ntabwo yari wenyine.
Children are right.	Abana bafite ukuri.
Downstairs, it wasn’t much.	Hasi, ntabwo byari byinshi.
I want to see my friend.	Ndashaka kubona inshuti yanjye.
Especially if you love someone.	Cyane cyane niba ukunda umuntu.
Many are many.	Byinshi ni byinshi.
That was difficult.	Ibyo byari bigoye.
And it is in this.	Kandi ari muri ibi.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
I never believed.	Sinigeze nizera.
It's good here, in everyone.	Nibyiza hano, muri buri muntu.
If you have any ideas or questions.	Niba ufite igitekerezo cyangwa ibibazo.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
I wanted to see what you look like.	Nashakaga kureba uko usa.
All he saw was what was to come.	Ibyo yabonye byose nibyo byari kuza.
I didn’t want much.	Sinifuzaga cyane.
They know this very well.	Bazi neza iki kintu.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
And he had nothing to do with it.	Kandi ntabwo yari afite ibintu byo kubikora.
I can't talk to him.	Sinshobora kuvugana na we.
Time to try.	Igihe cyo kugerageza.
And he was there too.	Kandi na we yari ahari.
You can't be alone.	Ntushobora kuba wenyine.
At the time, it was easy.	Icyo gihe byari byoroshye.
Why are you	Kuki uri?
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
He wanted to know what he was thinking.	Yashakaga kumenya icyo atekereza.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
Did you get a job?	Wabonye akazi?
I was behind him.	Nari inyuma ye.
Reka.	Reka.
He wanted to be.	Yashakaga kuba.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Nari nzi ko azi byose kuri njye.
But he wanted to do just that.	Ariko yashakaga gukora kimwe gusa.
That's all.	Nibyo byose.
Do you think it's hard to buy?	Uratekereza ko bigoye kugura?
She was a beautiful, intelligent woman.	Yari umugore mwiza, uzi ubwenge.
No.	Nta.
Absolutely.	Nukuri cyane.
She is your wife.	Ni umugore wawe.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Sometimes it worked out well.	Rimwe na rimwe byagenze neza.
He can read people.	Arashobora gusoma abantu.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko si byo.
He is going to try to find food.	Agiye kugerageza gushaka ibiryo.
It was really a good thing.	Mubyukuri byari ikintu cyiza.
I can't figure out, however, how to do it.	Sinshobora kumenya, ariko, uburyo bwo kubikora.
He found friends easy.	Yabonye inshuti byoroshye.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi.
I didn’t want to do this.	Sinifuzaga gukora ibi.
I think it's fast.	Ntekereza ko ari vuba.
Waiting, waiting, waiting.	Gutegereza, gutegereza, gutegereza.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
It's too much.	Ni byinshi cyane.
Or something else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu.
That's all right.	Nibyiza byose.
That's good right now.	Nibyiza kuri ubu.
We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
This is not an idea.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
You too.	Nawe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's great to be.	Nibyiza cyane kuba.
He agreed to come play.	Yemeye kuza gukina.
Where he had friends.	Aho yari afite inshuti.
You don't know for sure.	Ntabwo uzi neza.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
I can't do that.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora.
I thought.	Natekerezaga.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
He was his father.	Yari se.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
We don't need help.	Ntabwo dukeneye ubufasha.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
I don't know how he does it.	Ntabwo nzi uko abikora.
More than most.	Kurenza benshi.
I needed something to believe.	Nari nkeneye ikintu cyo kwizera.
What he meant.	Icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
I need a lot of money.	Nkeneye amafaranga menshi.
He had nothing to say.	Nta cyo yari yavuze.
We have to work hard.	Tugomba gukora cyane.
He can go.	Ashobora kugenda.
I'm here when you want to talk.	Ndi hano mugihe ushaka kuvuga.
I can't get out of here.	Sinshobora kuva hano.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
No one said much.	Nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
Like a movie.	Nka firime.
She was probably just a woman.	Birashoboka ko yari umugore gusa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You don't know for sure.	Ntabwo uzi neza.
I have almost everything I do.	Mfite ibintu hafi ya byose nkora.
This is every day.	Ubu ni buri munsi.

Just tell me what you think.	Gusa mbwira icyo utekereza.
I have the opportunity to be here.	Mfite amahirwe yo kuba hano.
Great to have you here with me !.	Nibyiza kuba ufite hano hamwe nanjye!.
Apparently he was scared.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ubwoba.
It's not good enough.	Ntabwo bihagije nibyiza.
As if this were my fault.	Nkaho ibi byari amakosa yanjye.
But only one.	Ariko umwe gusa.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
Okay, here.	Nibyiza, hano.
But now he is gone.	Ariko ubu yagiye.
He never did anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora.
I know why.	Nzi impamvu.
His wife.	Umugore we.
Here we are.	Hano turi.
I'm really worried.	Mfite impungenge rwose.
Just friends	Inshuti gusa.
I thought.	Ndatekereza.
He may be here.	Ashobora kuba hano.
Apparently he is.	Biragaragara ko ari.
Since then	Kuva icyo gihe.
I don’t like that, time.	Ntabwo nkunda ibyo, igihe.
I don't know why he went.	Sinzi impamvu yagiye.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
I didn't think about it.	Ntabwo natekereje kuri ibi.
He can do everything.	Arashobora gukora byose.
He found it difficult to find work.	Yabonye ko bigoye kubona akazi.
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
We can't do that here.	Ntidushobora kubikora hano.
I know you are a good person.	Nzi ko uri umuntu mwiza.
I don't believe so.	Ntabwo nizera ko aribyo.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
It was good, very good.	Byari byiza, byiza cyane.
He may not be far away.	Ashobora kuba atari kure.
No name.	Nta nama.
I was in this prison once too.	Nanjye nari muri iyi gereza rimwe.
His wife wants to live.	Umugore we arashaka kubaho.
He is ready to work.	Yiteguye gukora.
But in the short term.	Ariko mu gihe gito.
And no one needed it.	Kandi nta n'umwe wari ukeneye.
He was a good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza.
This one would work.	Uyu yari gukora.
He knew the truth, but he said nothing.	Yari azi ukuri, ariko ntacyo yavuze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
There is another problem.	Hariho ikindi kibazo.
I need normal.	Nkeneye bisanzwe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
And he needs a little work.	Kandi akeneye akazi gato.
It is the advice he needs.	Ni inama akeneye.
Very bad thing.	Ikintu kibi cyane.
We have nothing.	Dufite ikintu na kimwe.
You know where he is.	Uzi aho ari.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He did not know what it was.	Ntiyari azi icyo aricyo.
His family, one.	Umuryango we, umwe.
And he will do it.	Kandi azabikora.
I want to be on top.	Ndashaka kuba hejuru.
We have help.	Dufite ubufasha.
He knew what he was going to get.	Yari azi icyo yari kubona.
Absolutely, obviously!	Ibi rwose, biragaragara rwose!
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
He said what he thought.	Yavuze icyo atekereza.
He was not a family.	Ntabwo yari umuryango.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko.
I knew it was time to dump her and move on.	Nari nzi ko bishoboka icyo gihe.
We just have to move on.	Tugomba kujya imbere gusa.
And he had.	Kandi yari afite.
He hoped it was, but he knew it wasn't.	Yari yizeye ko ari, ariko yari azi ko atari byo.
I mean, that's right.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko aribyo.
Since then, he has been looking for a job.	Kuva icyo gihe, yashakaga akazi.
You want to be alone.	Urashaka kuba wenyine.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
You have a problem.	Ufite ikibazo.
That's right.	Byari byo.
One has to speak.	Umuntu agomba kuvuga.
To do it was to do what he wanted to do.	Kubikora gukora ibyo yashakaga gukora.
He has a friend.	Afite inshuti.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
You don't really need to do it alone.	Ntabwo rwose ukeneye kubikora wenyine.
It's good to think before you speak.	Nibyiza gutekereza mbere yo kuvuga.
He wanted to get back together.	Yashakaga gusubira hamwe.
We have dogs.	Dufite imbwa.
I want to.	Ni njye ashaka.
He needed to see.	Yari akeneye kubona.
It is not possible, but it is possible.	Ntabwo bishoboka, ariko birashoboka.
It was great advice.	Byari inama nziza cyane.
He is a boy.	Ni umuhungu.
No one knew where he was going.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho yagiye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
She loved to read.	Yakundaga gusoma.
I don’t really have to look closely.	Ntabwo rwose ngomba kureba neza.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
And that is something.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu.
I have no plans.	Ntabwo mfite gahunda.
You can do the same thing here.	Urashobora gukora ikintu kimwe hano.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Maybe this time it will be better.	Ahari iki gihe bizaba byiza.
It worked really well.	Byagenze neza rwose.
We have.	Dufite.
Or he can do something.	Cyangwa hari icyo ashobora gukora.
But many are not.	Ariko benshi sibyo.
He did not expect it to be easy.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ko byoroshye.
You have to learn to do this, when possible.	Ugomba kwiga gukora ibi, mugihe bishoboka.
I don’t like a lot of things.	Ntabwo nkunda ibintu byinshi.
Anything.	Ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
In all things.	Muri byose.
He had to do it.	Yagombaga kubikora.
Are you working 	Urimo ukora?
.	.
He hadn't thought much of it.	Ntabwo yari yatekereje kure.
He seemed to feel nothing.	Yasaga naho ntacyo yumva.
You are not.	Ntabwo uri.
No problem whatsoever.	Nta kibazo icyo aricyo cyose.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Mubyukuri ibyo byari ukuri.
Inside front.	Imbere imbere.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
And he made a lot of mistakes.	Kandi yafashe amakosa menshi.
We can't do anything here.	Ntabwo dushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe hano.
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
Nothing. 	Nta na kimwe.
'	'
And more.	Kandi byinshi.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
And he never did, though.	Kandi ntabwo yigeze agira, ariko.
You can't say.	Ntushobora kuvuga.
Like me	Nkanjye.
And he didn't know what to do.	Kandi ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
He did not expect it.	Ntiyari yiteze.
I am happy to have my daughter.	Nishimiye kuba mfite umukobwa wanjye.

We all have a lot to take.	Twese dufite byinshi byo gufata.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
I guess trying to figure out what the big one is.	Ndakeka kugerageza kumenya icyo kinini aricyo.
I wanted to stay, to hear more.	Nashakaga kuguma, kumva byinshi.
Can you find friends here?	Urashobora kubona inshuti hano?
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze agira.
I'm not sure what to believe, or what not to do.	Sinzi neza icyo nizera, cyangwa icyo ntagomba.
He speaks well.	Avuga neza.
I like to think about that.	Nkunda gutekereza kuri ibyo.
The bus went on time.	Bisi yagiye ku gihe.
Especially her children.	Cyane cyane abana be.
I had.	Nari mfite.
The food was really good.	Ibiryo byari byiza rwose.
The experiment was successful.	Kugerageza byagenze neza.
We have a problem.	Dufite ikibazo.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
I always feel like something or someone close to me.	Buri gihe numva ari ikintu cyangwa umuntu uri hafi yanjye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You know you can.	Uzi ko ushobora.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
There is no one here.	Hano nta muntu wenyine.
No one is around.	Nta n'umwe uri hafi.
They were upstairs.	Bari hejuru.
That much is clear now.	Ibyo byinshi biragaragara ubu.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
It was easy now.	Byari byoroshye ubu.
They probably had the truth.	Birashoboka ko bari bafite ukuri.
Absolutely.	Mubyukuri rwose.
Maybe you are.	Birashoboka ko uri.
Outside.	Hanze.
All day long	Umunsi wose.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
I don't even want to do it.	Sinshaka no kubikora.
But we need to know.	Ariko tugomba kumenya.
When he was about to give up.	Mugihe yari hafi kureka.
People had friends here.	Abantu bari bafite inshuti hano.
Your car is gone.	Imodoka yawe yagiye.
It is one and the same.	Ni umwe kandi umwe.
How did you get a job this morning?	Nigute wabonye akazi muri iki gitondo?
Now I know what he thinks.	Ubu nzi icyo atekereza.
I just want to.	Ndashaka gusa.
He says he is not, however.	Avuga ko avuga ko atari we, ariko.
I was wrong.	Nari mfite nabi.
There is everything to say, and nothing.	Hariho ibintu byose byo kuvuga, kandi ntacyo.
You know what you need.	Uzi icyo ukeneye.
He is not a morning person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu wo mu gitondo.
There is time here.	Hano hari umwanya.
I don't know what he's doing wrong.	Ntazi ko ibyo akora atari byo.
It was his chance.	Byari amahirwe ye.
He was not sure what to expect.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo yari yiteze.
It wasn't good, it wasn't easy.	Ntabwo byari byiza, ntabwo byari byoroshye.
He is young.	Ari muto.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
At the time, however, he was right.	Icyo gihe ariko, yari afite ukuri.
I do not mean.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
I don't know who we are.	Ntazi ko ari twe.
Walking on him.	Kugenda kuri we.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
No problem so far.	Nta kibazo kugeza ubu.
I want to be your friend.	Ndashaka kuba inshuti yawe.
We were, until then.	Twari, kugeza aho.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose ntabwo afite byinshi ubu.
I didn't know how to study.	Sinari nzi uburyo bwo kwiga.
I am one.	Ndi umwe.
We are too.	Natwe turi.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I wanted to be with you.	Nashakaga kubana nawe.
Or maybe it's not.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byo.
You have	Ufite.
I felt it was good.	Numvise ko ari byiza.
Can you eat	Urashobora kurya?
I also wanted to talk.	Nanjye nashakaga kuvuga.
I want to know why.	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu.
What can he see in her?	Ni iki ashobora kubona muri we?
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hari ikintu yari yabonye.
That, however, is not the case.	Ibyo ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
He was not going to tell me.	Ntabwo yari agiye kumbwira.
As you can do.	Nkuko ushobora kubikora.
We can't have that.	Ntidushobora kugira ibyo.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
You are looking for someone you love.	Ushaka umuntu ukunda.
One has to.	Umuntu agomba.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
You can find it here, here, and here.	Urashobora kubona hano, hano, na hano.
But he knew it was true.	Ariko yari azi ko aribyo.
He didn't need anything.	Nta na kimwe yari akeneye.
I should have thought the same.	Nari nkwiye gutekereza ko kimwe.
There is only one.	Hariho umwe gusa.
Family is everything.	Umuryango ni byose.
I’m sure he has a lot of plans for me.	Nzi neza ko afite gahunda nyinshi kuri njye.
Not the first.	Si ya mbere.
I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.	Sinzi neza icyo nkora nabi.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo.
That's all.	Nibyo gusa.
We are many.	Turi benshi.
He looked at both.	Yarebye bombi.
Apparently he was scared.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ubwoba.
And you really do.	Kandi rwose ufite.
One is luck.	Rimwe ni amahirwe.
That together.	Ibyo hamwe.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I want what it is.	Ndashaka icyo aricyo.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
The only problem is that this is not true.	Ikibazo gusa nuko ibyo atari ukuri.
I feel baby.	Ndumva umwana.
But the idea is the same.	Ariko igitekerezo ni kimwe.
I'm worried.	Mfite impungenge.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, kuri byose.
His young wife.	Umugore we muto.
I think he has a lot to do.	Ntekereza ko afite byinshi byo gukora.
I didn’t want to see a dog.	Sinifuzaga kubona imbwa.
You have to come well.	Ugomba kuza neza.
And he came to where I am.	Kandi yaje aho ndi.
In the room.	Mu cyumba.
Everything you say is true.	Ibyo wavuze byose nukuri.
I didn't do it above.	Ntabwo nakoze hejuru.
She had only one child.	Yari afite umwana umwe gusa.
We were good friends.	Twari inshuti nziza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko akunda kumva neza.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
It’s so good my dog.	Nibyiza cyane imbwa yanjye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He is doing well.	Agenda neza.
And he had it too.	Kandi na we yari afite.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
I was worse off than ever.	Nari mubi cyane kuruta ubu.
He said.	Ni we wavuze.
But he was scared.	Ariko yagize ubwoba.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
Living with you one day.	Kubana nawe umunsi umwe.
I understand.	Ndumva.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
He is always on time.	Buri gihe aba ari ku gihe.
That's right.	Ni cyo.
This is absolutely true.	Ibi rwose ni ukuri.
He did not comment on the value or accuracy of the information which was allegedly leaked to Hussein.	Ntabwo yagize icyo avuga ku kuba yari azi uwo ari we.
She likes to swim.	Akunda koga.
He is ready to go.	Yiteguye kugenda.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's not going away.	Ntabwo ari kugenda.
This house is beautiful.	Iyi nzu ni nziza.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
You should have seen that coming.	Wari ukwiye kubona ko kuza.
This is not just an idea, it is a fact.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa, ibi nukuri.
I don't think he will.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko azabikora.
It's best to go back to work.	Nibyiza gusubira ku kazi.
I just don't know how to do it.	Gusa sinzi kubikora.
I don't want to wait.	Sinshaka gutegereza.
The party went very well.	Ibirori byagenze neza cyane.
Learn more.	Kumenya byinshi.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko atari byose.
He did.	Yabikoze.
But that's not really the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
I know the problem.	Nzi ikibazo.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I am a beautiful girl.	Ndi umukobwa mwiza.
I can't do anything else.	Sinshobora gukora ikindi.
His house was downstairs.	Inzu ye yari hasi.
And very good.	Kandi nziza cyane.
It's too low.	Ari hasi cyane.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo sibyo.
And, more.	Kandi, ikindi.
He knows everything.	Azi byose.
You need to do it.	Ukeneye kubikora.
It's time.	Ni igihe.
This is a beautiful house.	Iyi ni inzu nziza.
We were friends once.	Twari inshuti rimwe.
Working hard, playing hard.	Gukora cyane, gukina cyane.
These are all his children.	Aba bose ni abana be.
Here at home.	Hano hano murugo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
My place.	Umwanya wanjye.
This is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye ibi.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Nzi neza ko atari byo.
I can't say what.	Sinshobora kuvuga iki.
There was nothing that anyone could see.	Nta na kimwe umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kubona.
I think this time is good.	Ntekereza ko iki gihe ari cyiza.
You bad	Wowe mubi.
Eventually he found a house.	Amaherezo yaje kubona inzu.
There was so much he could say.	Hariho byinshi yashoboraga kuvuga.
He was just scared.	Yari afite ubwoba gusa.
I wanted to read more.	Nashakaga gusoma byinshi.
This world is not your home.	Iyi si ntabwo ari inzu yawe.
He got three years.	Yabonye imyaka itatu.
They had nothing to say.	Nta cyo bari bafite cyo kuvuga.
He actually had the truth.	Mubyukuri yari afite ukuri.
They have no problem.	Nta kibazo bafite.
Always	Buri gihe.
He is a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I need a lot of money.	Nkeneye amafaranga menshi.
I want to be here.	Ndashaka ko hano hano.
He didn't need that.	Ntabwo yari akeneye ibyo.
Maybe you can go with you?	Ahari ushobora kujyana nawe?
I can't tell anyone.	Ntabwo nshobora kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I feel anxious.	Ndumva impungenge.
Absolutely nothing, really.	Ikintu rwose, mubyukuri.
Or maybe this one.	Cyangwa ahari iyi.
I heard it was there.	Numvise ko ahari.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
We have a job.	Dufite akazi.
Nowhere.	Nta na hamwe.
I need to know.	Nkeneye kumenya.
I want to live a long time.	Ndashaka kubaho igihe kirekire.
He could say nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga kuvuga.
It was hard to walk.	Byari bigoye kugenda.
What he says is true.	Ibyo avuga ni ukuri.
She wanted to be with him.	Yashakaga kubana na we.
All together	Bose hamwe.
My house is nearby.	Inzu yanjye iri hafi.
His youngest daughter.	Umukobwa we muto.
Only.	Gusa.
He would do it then.	Icyo gihe yari kubikora.
One more thing.	Ikindi kintu kimwe.
Nothing to do with time.	Ntacyo gukora umwanya.
The teacher was worried.	Umwarimu yari afite impungenge.
He thinks he is alone.	Yibwira ko ari wenyine.
He knew exactly why.	Yari azi neza impamvu.
But there is a problem with that.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kuri ibyo.
He was still very far away.	Yari akiri kure cyane.
The child can speak.	Umwana arashobora kuvuga.
I think he can do whatever he wants.	Ntekereza ko ashobora gukora icyo ashaka.
It's a good car.	Ni imodoka nziza.
He needed a lot of time.	Yari akeneye igihe kinini.
I think that's great.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza cyane.
You have everything you need.	Ufite ibyo ukeneye byose.
Everyone has money.	Umuntu wese afite amafaranga.
You are a beautiful woman.	Uri umugore mwiza cyane.
You can't do that right now.	Ntushobora rwose kubikora nonaha.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
I wanted to do something big.	Nashakaga gukora ikintu kinini.
Yes, you can stay home!	Nibyo, urashobora kuguma murugo!
I'm really going to look at this a little bit.	Nukuri rwose ngiye kureba muri ibi gato.
Tell me what happened.	Mbwira uko byagenze.
I do not have.	Ntabwo mfite.
And we are.	Kandi ni twe.
I hope this is not a mistake.	Ndizera ko ibi atari amakosa.
It was scary.	Byari ubwoba.
He tried to figure out how old he must be.	Yagerageje kumenya imyaka agomba kuba afite.
It's from the beginning.	Ni kuva mbere.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
I need to work on that.	Nkeneye gukora kuri ibyo.
One of us was.	Umwe muri twe yari.
With you	Hamwe nawe.
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
He has his own opinion.	Afite igitekerezo cye wenyine.
Thank you so much, so much.	Nyamuneka byinshi, byinshi.
I would do the same.	Nanjye nari kubikora.
That is us.	Uwo ni twe.
He did not know for sure.	Ntabwo yari azi neza.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo ari ibi.
'	'
He knows he can do it.	Azi ko ashobora kubikora.
I like to make friends, and to make new friends.	Nkunda kubona inshuti, no gushaka inshuti nshya.
Now is the time to talk.	Ubu ni igihe cyo kuvuga.
No one to talk to.	Nta muntu wo kuvugana.
If you know where to look.	Niba uzi aho ugomba kureba.
One thing for sure.	Ikintu kimwe rwose.
You have to know something.	Ugomba kumenya ikintu.
You can do it from home.	Urashobora kubikora kuva murugo.
He was expecting this.	Yari yiteze ibi.
He was young.	Yari muto.
I never liked this one.	Sinigeze nkunda iyi.
It would be hard to be a teacher.	Byaba bigoye kuba umwarimu.
First of all, we had money recently.	Mbere ya byose, twari dufite amafaranga vuba aha.
He works all the time.	Akora buri gihe.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
It would not be difficult.	Ntabwo byari kuba bigoye.
But that’s not very good.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
But he needed time to think.	Ariko yari akeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
Eventually it was very easy.	Amaherezo byari byoroshye cyane.
You are trying to be alone.	Urimo kugerageza wenyine.
But only.	Ariko gusa.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
Not on the day.	Ntabwo ari ku munsi.
But we are not human beings.	Ariko ntabwo turi abantu.
I knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Nari nzi ko ibyo yavuze byose aribyo.
It was too much to give up.	Byari byinshi cyane kureka.
Large and small.	Kinini na gito.
I'm just a kid.	Ndi umwana gusa.
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
Easy to navigate.	Kugenda byoroshye.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
I'm really doing this.	Ndimo gukora iki kintu rwose.
We can't stay.	Ntidushobora kuguma.
It is not very close, but also not very far.	Ntabwo ari hafi cyane, ariko kandi ntabwo ari kure cyane.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
I don't want to know anything.	Sinshaka kumenya ikintu na kimwe.
This was close to me.	Ibi byari hafi yanjye.
It was easy, very easy.	Byari byoroshye, byoroshye cyane.
You don't have to be here.	Ntugomba kuba hano.
I know that.	Nzi ko aribyo.
From a young age, this was him.	Kuva akiri muto, uyu yari uwo.
He had a home.	Yari afite murugo.
It seems very easy.	Birasa naho byoroshye cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I didn’t have time to think.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo gutekereza.
On Sunday, however, he did not arrive.	Ku cyumweru, ariko ntabwo yaje.
I didn’t think it was so good.	Sinatekerezaga ko ari byiza cyane.
I knew it then.	Nari nzi icyo gihe.
Maybe reading.	Ahari gusoma.
From this.	Kuva ibi.
Probably not his fault.	Birashoboka ko atari amakosa ye.
No need to go home.	Nta mpamvu yo gutaha.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
I don't have much time.	Ntabwo mfite igihe kinini.
I know there is more.	Nzi ko hari byinshi.
She is reading a lot.	Arimo gusoma cyane.
It was not a good thing.	Ntabwo byari ibintu byiza.
It was not a good movie.	Ntabwo yari firime nziza.
What do we have here?	Dufite iki hano?
I was on my own.	Nari kuri njye.
He didn’t have time to play.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo gukina.
Not here today.	Ntabwo ari hano uyu munsi.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
You saw nothing.	Ntacyo wabonye.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I don't see this.	Ntabwo mbona ibi.
I want her baby.	Ndashaka umwana we.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
It is my house.	Ni inzu yanjye.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
You need to know the truth.	Ugomba kumenya neza uko kuri.
They are absolutely scared.	Bafite ubwoba rwose.
He was one of us.	Yari umwe muri twe.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi sibyo.
But he was gone.	Ariko yari yagiye.
This is a job.	Iyi ni akazi.
That's all he did.	Ibyo aribyo byose yakoze.
Being close.	Kuba hafi.
But since then.	Ariko kuva icyo gihe.
I would do it.	Nari kubikora.
He did not do well.	Ntabwo yakoze neza.
Do you have time?	Ufite umwanya?
I did a lot of things.	Nakoze ibintu byinshi.
That's not the problem here.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo hano.
You have your time and that is it.	Ufite umwanya wawe kandi nibyo.
That's not the case with me.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri njye.
But this is us.	Ariko uyu ni twe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It's like a movie.	Ni nka firime.
She thought she was so beautiful.	Yatekereje ko yari mwiza cyane.
If you are.	Niba urimo.
It was his money.	Yari amafaranga ye.
I know that is the case.	Nzi ko aricyo kintu.
The young man was scared.	Umusore yari afite ubwoba.
I think we had.	Ndatekereza ko twari dufite.
I thought there was something wrong.	Natekereje ko hari amakosa.
Good advice here.	Inama nziza hano.
It wasn’t too much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi cyane.
It could be you or me.	Ashobora kuba wowe cyangwa njye.
I can't buy this.	Sinshobora kugura ibi.
I think it was true.	Ntekereza ko byari ukuri.
Anytime.	Igihe kimwe cyose.
I had a bad day.	Nari mfite umunsi mubi.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
You are doing a lot.	Urimo gukora byinshi.
I never wanted children.	Sinigeze nshaka abana.
Probably not.	Birashoboka, ntabwo ari rimwe.
He is sitting in his room.	Yicaye mu cyumba cye.
But it is also very difficult.	Ariko biragaragara ko bigoye cyane.
But that is not what he feels.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo yumva.
I can't do that.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora.
It's too young.	Ni muto cyane.
If there was a house, he was here.	Niba hari inzu, yari hano.
And it was not good.	Kandi ntabwo byari byiza.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
I have everything here.	Mfite ibintu byose hano.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
We are a family.	Turi umuryango.
I don't like it at all.	Ntabwo nkunda gato.
None of this he did.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo yakoze.
At all times 	Igihe cyose.
'	'
To him.	Kugeza kuri we.
He did not know when he was gone.	Ntiyari azi igihe yari amaze.
The truth is.	Ukuri ni.
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
I should say.	Nkwiye kuvuga.
It will be a while.	Bizaba igihe gito.
And we are not.	Kandi ntabwo turi.
But he did nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yakoze.
He would be scared.	Yaba afite ubwoba.
How is that possible?	Nigute bishoboka.
But we are close.	Ariko turi hafi.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
I just need to talk to you.	Nkeneye gusa kuvugana nawe.
Nothing big.	Nta kintu kinini na gito.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
Maybe he can think together.	Ahari arashobora gutekereza hamwe.
I think it's good.	Njye mbona ari byiza.
You want to do well, too.	Urashaka gukora neza, kandi.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
His advice was to.	Inama ye yagombaga.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari ukuri.
But you shouldn't do that if you don't want to.	Ariko ntugomba kubikora niba udashaka.
Or just to say.	Cyangwa kuvuga gusa.
But for now.	Ariko kuri ubu.
That's what you need to know.	Nibyo ukeneye kumenya.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
You are here, you can also do a lot of it.	Uri hano, ushobora no gukora byinshi muri byo.
You are very good.	Ufite neza cyane.
We can't figure out why.	Ntidushobora kumenya impamvu.
It is my family.	Ni umuryango wanjye.
You're going to stay here.	Ugiye kuguma hano.
There is definitely something for everyone.	Hariho ikintu rwose kuri buri wese.
But I don’t like it.	Ariko ntabwo nkunda.
What was he going to do?	Yari agiye gukora iki?.
I know it's hard.	Nzi ko bigoye.
It's good people.	Nibyiza abantu.
Yari.	Yari.
He was not ready to go.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye kugenda.
This is a guy you should listen to.	Uyu ni umusore ukwiye kumva.
He probably had a reason.	Birashoboka ko yari afite impamvu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He didn't say anything for a long time.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze mu gihe kirekire.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It always is.	Buri gihe ni.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
We had.	Twari dufite.
Good thing here.	Ikintu cyiza hano.
But that's right.	Ariko nibyo.
It's good outside and inside.	Nibyiza hanze no imbere.
In a short time, it seems.	Igihe gito, birasa.
This is exactly what happened.	Ibi nibyo rwose.
I am the only one here.	Ninjye wenyine hano.
They were just children.	Bari abana gusa.
I am the right person.	Ndi umuntu ukwiye.
There are many children here.	Hano hari abana benshi.
Me too.	Nanjye.
I only have one problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe gusa.
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
It's great here.	Nibyiza cyane hano.
I know he has.	Nzi ko afite.
But it is very good.	Ariko nibyiza cyane.
I can't figure out if that is the case.	Sinshobora kumenya niba aribyo.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
And, yes, I realize I'm the billionth person to make that joke.	Kandi, birashoboka cyane cyane.
We have another problem.	Dufite ikindi kibazo.
We are in fact.	Turi mubyukuri.
What he expected.	Ibyo yari yiteze.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You don't think so.	Ntabwo utekereza neza.
He had seen nothing.	Ntacyo yari yabonye.
He didn't know much.	Ntabwo yari azi ibintu byinshi.
I have nothing to say.	Ntacyo nshaka kuvuga.
Almost absolutely nothing they would do.	Hafi ya rwose ntacyo bari gukora.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
He wanted to get out of here.	Yashakaga kuva hano.
I'm behind you.	Ndi inyuma yawe.
Driving license	Imodoka yo gutwara.
We had tomorrow.	Twari dufite ejo.
He may or may not.	Ashobora, cyangwa ntashobora.
He was not alone at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yari wenyine.
In fact, that's all there is to it.	Mubyukuri, nibyo byose.
Outside there is a lot outside.	Hanze hari hanze cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I wanted to see what you were doing.	Nashakaga kureba ibyo urimo gukora.
He wanted to do more.	Yashakaga gukora byinshi.
Niki.	Niki.
It's all about me.	Byose kuri njye.
Or like.	Cyangwa nka.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
It's a big deal now.	Ni ikintu kinini ubu.
You have this.	Ufite ibi.
I think here.	Ndatekereza hano.
He had no plans.	Nta gahunda yari afite.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo.
Everyone knows everything.	Abantu bose bazi byose.
And it is.	Kandi ni.
I see that phone.	Mbona iyo terefone.
He never left.	Ntiyigeze agenda.
You can have a party.	Urashobora gukora ibirori.
But it is not easy to find the truth.	Ariko ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye kubona ukuri.
None of that, right now.	Nta gihe na kimwe muri byo, ubu.
He did well.	Yagize neza.
He could buy whatever he wanted.	Yashoboraga kugura icyo ashaka cyose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
Maybe you can help.	Ahari ushobora gufasha.
The fear he had.	Ubwoba yari afite.
Always	Buri gihe.
I think he did something wrong.	Ntekereza ko yakoze ikintu kibi.
He is a good, loving person.	Ni umuntu mwiza, ukunda.
That is not the case here or here.	Ibyo ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
And in the morning.	No mu gitondo.
I'm just happy to be with you.	Nishimiye gusa kubana nawe.
The money came quickly.	Amafaranga yaje vuba.
But we can't go.	Ariko ntidushobora kugenda.
Obviously that is it.	Biragaragara ko aribyo.
He has a daughter.	Afite umukobwa.
We had very little time.	Twari dufite umwanya muto cyane.
No one was in the room.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari mu cyumba.
More than anything.	Kurenza ikintu cyose.
He was young.	Yari akiri muto.
One day, he would not eat anything.	Umunsi umwe, nta kintu na kimwe yari kurya.
At that point, he agreed to go with me.	Icyo gihe, yemeye kujyana nanjye.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
I have all that.	Mfite ibyo byose.
It was below average.	Yari munsi yo munsi.
And they have the truth.	Kandi bafite ukuri.
He did not move forward.	Ntiyigeze imbere.
I'm glad it worked out.	Nishimiye ko byagenze neza.
Especially this week.	Cyane cyane muri iki cyumweru.
It was his family.	Yari umuryango we.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I didn’t want to be one.	Sinifuzaga kuba umwe.
But today is the day.	Ariko uyu munsi ni umunsi.
I think you have a problem.	Ntekereza ko ufite ikibazo.
You would not eat.	Ntabwo wari kurya.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
Reading a book.	Gusoma igitabo.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
He says he can't do it.	Avuga ko adashobora kubikora.
The house is beautiful.	Inzu ni nziza.
Only one person knew.	Umuntu umwe gusa yari azi.
And this house.	Kandi iyi nzu.
He went to eat.	Yagiye kurya.
I really understand how much you love everyone.	Ndumva cyane uburyo ukunda umuntu wose.
And he had taken it.	Kandi yari yafashe.
I can't think of anything.	Sinshobora gutekereza icyo.
And so should you.	Kandi nawe ugomba kuba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
We are here and we have work to do.	Turi hano kandi dufite akazi ko gukora.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
Is it possible? 	Birashoboka?
I know a lot of things.	Nzi ibintu byinshi.
But when things went awry, he had no plans.	Ariko igihe ibintu byagenze nabi, nta gahunda yari afite.
But it looks good.	Ariko birasa neza.
He was looking for anyone.	Yashakaga umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It's just beautiful.	Ni mwiza gusa.
We can't stay.	Ntidushobora kuguma.
But you are a beautiful girl.	Ariko uri umukobwa mwiza.
I only work here.	Nkora hano gusa.
Going to work.	Kujya ku kazi.
I can't wait, man.	Sinshobora gutegereza, muntu.
He was young and beautiful.	Yari muto kandi mwiza.
He needed time.	Yari akeneye umwanya.
He wanted to think about that.	Yashakaga gutekereza kuri icyo kibazo.
Only.	Gusa.
I have to think about that.	Ngomba gutekereza kuri iyo.
He was ready to go.	Yari yiteguye kugenda.
I saw it nearby.	Nabonye hafi.
But tell me what you think !.	Ariko mbwira icyo utekereza!.
It had to be something.	Yagombaga kuba ikintu.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo byiza cyane kugeza ubu.
It's up to him.	Ni kuri we.
But he has to look at the woman.	Ariko agomba kureba umugore.
It is not easy, and there is a lot to learn.	Ntabwo byoroshye, kandi hariho ibintu byinshi byo kwiga.
We have a lot of problems.	Dufite ibibazo byinshi.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
That was easy enough.	Ibyo byari byoroshye bihagije.
He must hear.	Agomba kumva.
Inside me.	Imbere muri njye.
I'm doing it.	Ndimo kubikora.
That's what I think this morning.	Nibyo ndakeka muri iki gitondo.
You have to do it right.	Ugomba gukora neza.
Here and there.	Hano na hano.
I can't say right now.	Sinshobora kuvuga ubu.
I want to do something, to be human.	Ndashaka gukora ikintu, kuba umuntu.
Or you can try it yourself.	Cyangwa urashobora kugerageza wenyine.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I don't even have to say anything else.	Ntabwo ngomba no kuvuga ikindi kintu.
The problem is you.	Ikibazo ni wowe.
We are finally on something.	Amaherezo turi ku kintu.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I knew it was there.	Nari nzi ko ahari.
He has something to say.	Hari icyo avuga.
This is not difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye.
Very good this week.	Nibyiza cyane kuri iki cyumweru.
But sometimes one has to.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe umuntu agomba.
You did it.	Niwowe wabikoze.
And it was really good.	Kandi byari byiza rwose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It's in the house.	Ni mu nzu.
Travel time.	Igihe cyo kugenda.
I am so happy to be here.	Nishimiye cyane kuba ndi hano.
He knew something.	Hari icyo yari azi.
It's just something.	Ni ikintu gusa.
He did everything we needed.	Yakoze ibyo dukeneye byose.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
'	'
I can't tell anyone.	Ntabwo nshobora kubwira umuntu.
She feels scared.	Yumva afite ubwoba.
So far, there is much to be done.	Kugeza ubu, hari byinshi bishoboka.
What? 	Niki?
But he has.	Ariko afite.
But no one knew what to do.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo gukora.
Today he is gone.	Uyu munsi yagiye.
This is not my first day at work.	Ntabwo ari umunsi wanjye wa mbere ku kazi.
He has to go alone.	Agomba kugenda wenyine.
A lot of people here are smart.	Abantu benshi hano bafite ubwenge.
He saw that he had gone early.	Yabonye ko yagiye kare.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And he tried everything.	Kandi yagerageje byose.
It looks good on me.	Birasa neza kuri njye.
He is a young man.	Ni umusore.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
You can only believe what you see.	Urashobora kwizera gusa ibintu wabonye.
There is something about that.	Hariho ikintu kuri ibyo.
He did not know exactly why.	Ntabwo yari azi neza impamvu.
Stop being like that again.	Reka kuba gutya kandi.
She has a favorite job.	Afite akazi akunda.
You can't go back.	Ntushobora gusubira inyuma.
We have to do something.	Tugomba gukora ikintu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
That's right.	Ni byo.
Finally! 	Amaherezo!
It would be.	Byaba.
They probably had the truth.	Birashoboka ko bari bafite ukuri.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
And alone.	Kandi wenyine.
Nor did he mean.	Cyangwa ntiyashakaga kuvuga.
You really need one in each room.	Ukeneye rwose kimwe muri buri cyumba.
He started studying under him.	Yatangiye kwiga munsi ye.
I had trouble walking.	Nagize ikibazo cyo kugenda.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He became his friend.	Yaje kuba inshuti ye.
But he did not say.	Ariko ntiyigeze avuga.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I knew exactly where they were.	Nari nzi rwose aho bari.
Not really his father.	Mubyukuri ntabwo ari se.
And he was a boy.	Kandi yari umuhungu.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
He now had a lot of money.	Ubu yari afite amafaranga menshi.
You could be something else.	Urashobora kuba ikindi kintu.
Very good !.	Byiza cyane!.
He did a lot of people.	Yakoze abantu benshi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
But that is not the case.	Ariko si ikibazo.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
Obviously not you.	Biragaragara ko atari wowe.
He wanted to leave the house again.	Yashakaga kongera kuva mu nzu.
But we must.	Ariko tugomba.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
You don’t know exactly where I’m going wrong.	Ntabwo uzi neza aho ngiye nabi.
I knew the truth.	Nari nzi ukuri.
No one has ever done that.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
I believe he is right.	Ndizera ko afite ukuri.
We are here now.	Ubu turi hano.
You can also go home.	Urashobora kandi gutaha.
No one can say this.	Nta muntu ushobora kuvuga ibi.
Outside of me.	Hanze yanjye.
But it was a good party, and he did well.	Ariko byari ibirori byiza, kandi yari yakoze neza.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
But you can do it.	Ariko urashobora kubikora.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko aribyo.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
You have to do the same.	Ugomba gukora kimwe.
We have to go fast.	Tugomba kugenda vuba.
I love that you can do it.	Nkunda ko ushobora gukora.
But he was a good guy, a really good guy.	Ariko yari umusore mwiza, umusore mwiza rwose.
If he was good.	Niba yari mwiza.
I've never seen so many cars here.	Sinigeze mbona imodoka nyinshi hano.
He must be my best friend.	Agomba kuba inshuti yanjye nziza.
And he didn't want to go back.	Kandi ntiyashakaga gusubira inyuma.
I was so happy all that time.	Nishimiye cyane icyo gihe cyose.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
To do so.	Kubikora.
To try	Kugerageza.
And there are many things.	Kandi hariho ibintu byinshi.
You didn't know your time.	Ntabwo wari uzi umwanya wawe.
None of this he did.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo yakoze.
But that's not really the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
I want to be human.	Ndashaka kuba umuntu.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I know not much.	Nzi ko atari byinshi.
You can do whatever you want with him.	Urashobora gukora icyo ushaka hamwe na we.
This is my chance.	Ubu ni amahirwe yanjye.
Getting a job now.	Kubona akazi ko gukora ubu.
But that's not exactly what happened.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo rwose uko byagenze.
It was not a reason.	Ntabwo yari impamvu.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
He knew it for the first time.	Yari azi bwa mbere.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I needed money badly.	Nari nkeneye amafaranga nabi.
He claims to be.	Niwe avuga ko ari.
He saw that in the first week.	Yabonye ibyo mu cyumweru cya mbere.
Bad idea.	Igitekerezo kibi.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
He should definitely go to school.	Agomba rwose kujya ku ishuri.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
He was thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
He thought of that as a possibility.	Yatekereje kuri ibyo bishoboka.
Tom looked away.	Tom yarebye kure.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You are very smart.	Ufite ubwenge cyane.
You have to be alone.	Ugomba kuba wenyine.
And that's exactly what he needed right now.	Kandi nibyo yari akeneye ubu.
Who do you like the most?	Ninde ukunda cyane?
There is only time in front of me.	Hariho umwanya gusa imbere yanjye.
He is very happy with the situation.	Yishimiye cyane uko ibintu byagenze.
You need to live.	Ukeneye kubaho.
But we can't know for sure.	Ariko ntidushobora kumenya neza.
We really have.	Dufite rwose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I had a lot of questions about that.	Nagize ibibazo byinshi kuri ibyo.
Why does he look so good?	Kuki asa neza?
I'm going to read that.	Ngiye gusoma ibyo.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
Just me	Ni njye gusa.
He later thought about it.	Nyuma yaje gutekereza.
But close.	Ariko hafi.
You may not know that he has.	Ntushobora kumenya ko afite.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That no one wanted.	Uwo nta muntu n'umwe yashakaga.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
The party will be great for the kids.	Ibirori bizaba byiza kubana.
She was an unknown woman.	Yari umugore atazi.
You are working hard.	Urimo gukora cyane.
I knew then.	Icyo gihe nari nzi.
Really good thing.	Mubyukuri, ikintu cyiza.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
He was swimming a lot.	Yari koga cyane.
I'm close.	Ndi hafi.
As if there was only one book.	Nkaho hariho igitabo kimwe gusa.
Apparently he had trouble walking.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ikibazo cyo kugenda.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
It was simple, but it was good.	Byari byoroshye, ariko byari byiza.
He is sitting there.	Yicaye aho.
You can say whatever you want.	Urashobora kuvuga uburyo icyo ushaka cyose.
He can.	Ashobora.
I have to find a way to do it.	Ngomba gushaka uburyo bwo kubikora.
I was a woman.	Nari umugore.
A lot of it was good, but it wasn’t good.	Byinshi byari byiza, ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
You know the problem.	Uzi ikibazo.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe mbere.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Niki.	Niki.
Seeing and hearing.	Kureba no kumva.
He knew everything and nothing.	Yari azi byose kandi ntacyo.
However, the house.	Ariko, inzu.
I'm not sorry about any of that.	Ntabwo mbabajwe na kimwe muri byo.
This time it's just me.	Iki gihe ni njye gusa.
No looking ahead.	Nta kureba imbere.
He looked frightened.	Yarebye afite ubwoba.
This is a lot.	Ibi ni byinshi.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
Walking dogs.	Kugenda imbwa.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo uyu munsi, ntabwo ari umukobwa.
Her hair was beautiful.	Umusatsi we wari mwiza.
I want them to do it.	Ndashaka ko abikora.
I know a lot of people.	Nzi abantu benshi.
I did nothing.	Ntacyo nakoze.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
That's right- this is not about you.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari wowe.
He chose the time.	Yahisemo umwanya.
I think he is.	Ntekereza ko ari we.
We have to play with what we have.	Tugomba gukina nibyo dufite.
I would do a lot.	Nari gukora byinshi.
He did not expect problems.	Ntabwo yiteze ibibazo.
It's great, though.	Nibyiza cyane ariko.
He knows he is doing wrong.	Azi ko akora nabi.
Everything	Buri kintu
You are becoming normal.	Urimo kuba ibintu bisanzwe.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
I really believe he meant it.	Nizera rwose ko yashakaga kuvuga.
My daughter.	Umukobwa wanjye.
I don't think that would be the case.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko byaba aribyo bigoye cyane.
For that, nothing.	Kuri iyo, nta kintu.
I like to do it.	Nkunda kubikora.
I have this.	Mfite ibi.
You know exactly why.	Uzi neza impamvu.
The truth.	Ukuri.
You can tell me what happened behind you.	Urashobora kumbwira uko byagenze inyuma yawe.
But everyone has.	Ariko buri wese afite.
I wanted more.	Nashakaga byinshi.
He would be scared.	Yaba afite ubwoba.
I think they are lucky.	Ntekereza ko bafite amahirwe.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
You have to get off the bus.	Ugomba kuva muri bisi.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
In both cases.	Muri bombi.
It was his chance.	Byari amahirwe ye.
Her teacher, maybe.	Umwarimu we, birashoboka.
You don't have to do anything else.	Ntugomba gukora ikindi kintu.
You are not sure of the problem.	Ntabwo uzi neza ikibazo.
They are so many people.	Ni abantu benshi cyane.
But maybe you want to go, come home.	Ariko birashoboka ko ushaka kugenda, gutaha.
We don't have that.	Ntabwo dufite ibyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko umuntu azi byinshi.
You know you're beautiful.	Uzi ko uri mwiza.
He chose to leave.	Yahisemo ko agomba kugenda.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
Definitely go to jail.	Rwose kujya muri gereza.
'	'
I work every day.	Nkora buri munsi.
It was good enough.	Byari byiza bihagije.
From top to bottom.	Kuva hejuru kugeza hasi.
He must be present.	Agomba kuba ahari.
He said it was a great swim.	Yavuze ko ari koga cyane.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
Tell me what you can do.	Mbwira icyo ushobora gukora.
It's something you want to do.	Ni ikintu ushaka gukora.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
But he didn't look like him, either.	Ariko ntabwo yasaga na we, ntabwo aribyo.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
I like parties.	Nkunda ibirori.
He saw nothing.	Nta kintu yabonye.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
One was a young girl.	Umwe yari umukobwa muto.
And that is possible.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka.
I feel like a child.	Numva ndi umwana.
Not only is it good for us, it is good for the world.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri twe gusa, ni byiza kuri iyi si.
He didn't go.	Ntabwo yagiye.
Today	Kuri uyu munsi.
That's not enough.	Ibyo ntabwo bihagije.
I don't know what to do now.	Sinzi icyo gukora ubu.
I didn't know what it was.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo.
He admitted that what he did was wrong.	Yemeye ko ibyo yakoze byari amakosa.
You may have seen one go now.	Birashoboka ko wabonye umwe agenda nonaha.
Once you have to work.	Rimwe ugomba gukora.
He had time for everyone.	Yari afite umwanya kuri buri wese.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
Person to person.	Umuntu ku muntu.
Either way, he should try.	Ibyo ari byo byose, agomba kugerageza.
But you have.	Ariko ufite.
He went to her.	Yagiye muri we.
We have today.	Dufite uyu munsi.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
It’s not hard to see why.	Ntabwo bigoye kubona impamvu.
But it is true.	Ariko ni byo koko.
Good.	Nziza.
There is so much to see.	Hari byinshi byo kubona.
He could understand why.	Yashoboraga kumva impamvu.
You are watching his family.	Urimo kureba umuryango we.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I am your wife.	Ndi umugore wawe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
She can't get a job.	Ntashobora kubona akazi.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
Good things are really good.	Ibintu byiza nibyiza rwose.
I know what he wants.	Nzi icyo ashaka.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
You shouldn't have gone.	Ntabwo wari ukwiye kugenda.
The child is young.	Umwana ni muto.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's a very recent issue.	Ni ikibazo cya vuba cyane.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
It is not my fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yanjye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari byinshi.
It was until this morning.	Byari kugeza uyu munsi mu gitondo.
I am very happy to buy.	Nishimiye cyane kugura.
I don’t know when or how or why.	Sinzi igihe cyangwa uburyo cyangwa impamvu.
Any other problem.	Ikindi kibazo cyose.
I did, but I didn't.	Nakoze, ariko sibyo.
We were in his room.	Twari mu cyumba cye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza, nibyiza cyane.
This house looked like it.	Iyi nzu yasaga nkaho.
Much to think about.	Byinshi byo gutekereza.
I'm glad he wasn't.	Nishimiye ko atari muri ibyo.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora kuri ibyo.
I can't take anything else.	Sinshobora gufata ikindi.
This is not easy at all.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye na gato.
I think that's exactly what happened.	Ntekereza ko aribyo rwose.
I saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe nabonye.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
He had come ready.	Yari yaje yiteguye.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You may have where you are.	Urashobora kuba ufite aho uri.
And he chose to take everything.	Kandi yahisemo gufata ibintu byose.
He took his time doing it.	Yafashe igihe cye abikora.
She loved being with us.	Yakundaga kubana natwe.
Too many, maybe.	Benshi cyane, birashoboka.
I mean, he's human.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari umuntu.
The job is too big for him.	Akazi ni kinini kuri we.
He needed to find something.	Yari akeneye gushaka ikintu.
, not me.	, si njye.
It is not as close as it should be.	Ntabwo ari hafi cyane nkuko agomba kuba.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It is not a car.	Ntabwo ari imodoka.
One did not hear anything.	Umwe ntacyo yumvise.
I wanted it badly.	Nashakaga nabi.
Too much, too much.	Byinshi cyane, birashoboka cyane.
I wanted him to do anything.	Nashakaga ko akora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
Obviously.	Biragaragara rwose.
It wouldn't make sense.	Ntabwo byari kumva.
Very bad time.	Igihe kibi cyane.
Anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Maybe it would be better.	Ahari byaba byiza.
I really have.	Mfite rwose.
.	.
He could hear nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kumva.
I think the hair looks good.	Ntekereza ko umusatsi usa neza neza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo byose.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
Well, this is good for me.	Nibyo, ibi ni byiza kuri njye.
I know where you're going.	Nanjye uzi aho ugiye.
I doubt many people have.	Ndashidikanya ko abantu benshi bafite.
Probably, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka.
You have to make that movie.	Ugomba gukora iyo firime.
We didn't need that.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye ibyo.
I knew.	Nari nzi.
At that point.	Kuri icyo gihe.
But he is not here today, and you are.	Ariko ntabwo ari hano muri iki gihe, kandi uri.
I didn’t think much of it.	Ntabwo natekereje kuri byinshi.
That he was so bad.	Ko yari mubi cyane.
I'm not sure why he was on the agenda.	Sinzi neza impamvu yari muri gahunda.
Learning.	Kwiga.
But not soon enough.	Ariko si vuba bihagije.
I do one.	Nkora umwe.
The woman wanted to see.	Umugore yashakaga kubona.
They had no time for us.	Ntabwo bari bafite umwanya kuri twe.
He had the same problem.	Yari afite ikibazo kimwe.
It's a problem for me.	Ni ikibazo kuri njye.
It's my phone.	Ni terefone yanjye.
Not good, but it worked.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko byagenze neza.
Tell me this.	Mbwira ibi.
You have to live well.	Ugomba kubaho neza.
Or not so much today.	Cyangwa si byinshi muri iki gihe.
That's not what he wants.	Ntabwo aribyo yifuza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
It's just clothes.	Ni imyenda gusa.
This time the girl.	Iki gihe umukobwa.
After looking back, he was gone.	Amaze kureba inyuma, yari yagiye.
But he was not what he expected.	Ariko si we yari yiteze.
But your dog.	Ariko imbwa yawe.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
You can stop this.	Urashobora guhagarika ibi.
I'm not good at being alone.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza kuba wenyine.
This was an easy task.	Ibi byari ibintu byoroshye gukora.
You want to try.	Ushaka kugerageza.
If so.	Kuri niba.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
They have a problem living together.	Bafite ikibazo cyo kubana neza.
He was also young.	Na we yari akiri muto.
We need something else.	Dukeneye ikindi kintu.
You have to get it.	Ugomba kubona.
I didn't know what else to do.	Sinari nzi ikindi gukora.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
It was not very difficult.	Ntabwo byari bigoye cyane.
He was in school.	Yari mwishuri.
We have a lot of kids like him here.	Dufite abana benshi nka we hano.
I feel like sometimes you have to go.	Ndumva ko rimwe na rimwe ugomba kugenda.
I really saw it.	Nabonye rwose.
She was his wife.	Umugore yari we.
I don't think it would be today.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko byari kuba uyu munsi.
But, it was good.	Ariko, byari byiza.
I don’t think that’s the way to do it.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari uburyo bwo kubikora.
I saw him do it.	Nabonye abikora.
Just space.	Umwanya gusa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I have never seen him speak so much, in fact.	Sinigeze mbona avuga cyane, mubyukuri.
He had no reason.	Nta mpamvu yari afite.
I knew he would do it.	Nari nzi ko azabikora.
You can't be both.	Ntushobora kuba bombi.
You can’t think of much.	Ntushobora gutekereza kuri byinshi.
He chose to go ahead.	Yahisemo kujya imbere.
We have to be close now.	Tugomba kuba hafi ubu.
They were very close, but so far.	Bari hafi cyane, ariko kugeza ubu.
Just here.	Hano hano gusa.
Or from here.	Cyangwa kuva hano.
He knew he couldn't.	Yari azi ko adashobora.
To see	Kubona.
He was alone in the room.	Yari wenyine mu cyumba.
That was clever.	Ibyo byari ubwenge.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
He is going to be here for a long time.	Agiye kuba hano igihe kirekire.
It's not just a phone call.	Ntabwo ari terefone gusa.
I hope you don't want to wait.	Nizere ko udashaka gutegereza.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
I can't go far here.	Sinshobora kujya kure aha.
Doing something good is possible.	Gukora ikintu cyiza birashoboka.
And recently.	Kandi vuba aha.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I think it was just me.	Ntekereza ko yari njye gusa.
It wasn't hard after all.	Ntabwo byari bigoye nyuma ya byose.
He thought it was.	Yatekereje ko ari.
You have to work.	Ugomba gukora akazi.
That morning.	Muri icyo gitondo.
It's good to play.	Nibyiza gukina.
He began to look worried.	Yatangiye kureba afite impungenge.
Sometimes it's good.	Rimwe na rimwe ni byiza.
I should have been a better player.	Nari nkwiye kuba umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
They are right where you are.	Bafite ukuri aho uri.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
But apparently that is not the case.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari ko byagenze.
The day was one day.	Umunsi wari umunsi umwe.
We.	We.
That's a long time.	Icyo ni igihe kirekire.
But since then, he had heard nothing.	Ariko kuva icyo gihe, nta kintu yari yumvise.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
He wanted to do it on his own.	Yashakaga kubikora wenyine.
We are very high.	Turi hejuru cyane.
Very good handling.	Gufata neza cyane.
That it will be a long time.	Ko bizaba igihe kirekire.
I'm not sorry	Ntabwo mbabajwe.
Good luck to him.	Amahirwe kuri we.
By now, that was enough.	Kuri ubu, ibyo byari bihagije.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
But this was my house.	Ariko iyi yari inzu yanjye.
With us.	Natwe.
He wanted to drive.	Yashakaga gutwara.
Lots of kids here.	Abana benshi hano.
You might say that.	Urashobora kuvuga ko aribyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hariho ikibazo cya.
That person was me.	Uwo muntu yari njye.
But there is plenty of food.	Ariko hariho ibiryo byinshi.
Doing something.	Gukora ikintu.
He thought it was enough.	Yatekereje ko byari bihagije.
He enjoyed his friend.	Yishimiye inshuti ye.
They are smart.	Bafite ubwenge.
He knew what he meant.	Yari azi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He took the boy.	Yafashe umuhungu.
I am beautiful too.	Nanjye ndi mwiza.
But he had none.	Ariko nta na kimwe yari afite.
Why the child wanted to talk so much.	Impamvu umwana yashakaga kuvuga cyane.
I shouldn’t have looked.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kureba.
It's a small issue.	Ni ikibazo gito.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Only us.	Ni twe gusa.
But what if it's easy?	Ariko se niba aribyo byoroshye.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I'm worried about him.	Mfite impungenge kuri we.
I am at home working.	Ndi murugo nkora.
The food is good.	Ibiryo byo kurya ni byiza.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I was scared to be here like that.	Nari mfite ubwoba bwo kuba hano gutya.
I don't want a problem.	Sinshaka ikibazo.
That's exactly what he thought.	Nibyo rwose yatekerezaga.
It was good to stay.	Byari byiza kuguma.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
I like that he just wants to work.	Nkunda ko ashaka gukora gusa.
You think.	Uratekereza.
This program was not good.	Iyi gahunda ntiyari nziza.
He enjoyed dogs.	Yishimiye imbwa.
And like.	Kandi nka.
He bought a nice house.	Yaguze inzu nziza.
Whatever it is, it will happen.	Ibyo ari byo byose bizaba, bizaba.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
He is in this film.	Ari muri iyi firime.
It was not a matter of knowing.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo cyo kumenya.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
I feel fortunate to be here.	Ndumva mfite amahirwe yo kuba hano.
I know it's probably not a good thing to do.	Nzi ko bishoboka ko atari ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
This is me.	Uyu ni njye.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
He said he was not alone.	Yavuze ko atari wenyine.
Only.	Gusa.
It was a wonderful day.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane.
For many, it is possible.	Kuri benshi, birashoboka.
He would not drive his car.	Ntiyari gutwara imodoka ye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
For a long time	Mu gihe kirekire.
You do what you want.	Ukora kubyo ushaka.
Not really the same thing.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikintu kimwe.
He saw.	Yabonye.
He loved to play.	Yakundaga gukina.
This is very good.	Iyi ni nziza cyane.
I know exactly where you are going.	Nzi neza aho ugiye.
I am a young man.	Ndi umusore.
I have nothing.	Nta na kimwe mfite.
We really need to know what we can know.	Dukeneye rwose kumenya icyo dushobora kumenya.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
It's not good to do that.	Ntabwo ari byiza kubikora.
Something you need to know.	Ikintu ukeneye kumenya.
You can try it out.	Urashobora kugerageza kugerageza.
In fact, she has a baby.	Mubyukuri, afite umwana.
That's all.	Ibyo byose ni byose.
He would not have received help.	Ntabwo yari kubona ubufasha.
But it was almost time to leave.	Ariko byari hafi igihe cyo kugenda.
A lot of that you got right.	Ibyo byinshi wabonye neza.
He had.	Yari afite.
It's not another week.	Ntabwo ari ikindi cyumweru.
We can't live together.	Ntidushobora kubana.
Something in me.	Ikintu muri njye.
But today is not easy.	Ariko uyumunsi ntabwo byoroshye.
I think it was.	Ntekereza ko byari.
Most people have children.	Abantu benshi bafite abana.
Whatever he did.	Ibyo ari byo byose yabikoze.
But no one knew.	Ariko nta n'umwe yari azi.
And he was a good friend.	Kandi yari inshuti nziza.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
Or to stop the problem.	Cyangwa guhagarika icyo kibazo.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Nzi neza ko atari ko byagenze.
It was a thing.	Byari ibintu.
He had many friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
One thing every day.	Ikintu kimwe buri munsi.
He has one daughter.	Afite umukobwa umwe.
The reasons are many.	Impamvu ni nyinshi.
You may have seen this.	Birashoboka ko wabonye ibi.
It was just a matter of time.	Yari ikibazo gusa.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari kubikora imbere.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
I knew you had to do it as fast as you could.	Nari nzi ko ugomba gukora vuba vuba nkuko bisanzwe.
He does nothing wrong.	Nta kibi akora.
I really want to understand why.	Ndashaka rwose kumva impamvu.
It was like a movie.	Byari nka firime.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I can be a teacher.	Nshobora kuba umwarimu.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibi ni ukuri.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
It will be.	Bizaba.
He seemed young.	Yasaga naho akiri muto.
I'm sure he's a good friend.	Nzi neza ko ari inshuti nziza.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
A lot to do.	Byinshi byo gukora.
Playing is a job.	Gukina ni akazi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Ntacyo, ntacyo, ntacyo.
None of this is a problem.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ikibazo.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
But everything is not easy.	Ariko byose ntabwo byoroshye.
I'm so sorry.	Mbabajwe cyane nibyo.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
Probably not for long.	Birashoboka ko atari igihe kirekire.
Nothing to eat.	Ntacyo kurya.
Good hair	Umusatsi mwiza.
He can help here.	Arashobora gufasha hano.
True and true.	Kuri no kuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We are close now.	Kuri ubu dufite hafi.
I would do a lot.	Nari gukora byinshi.
Everything is really good and simple and easy.	Byose nibyiza rwose kandi byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
He was sitting there.	Yari yicaye aho.
Whatever you think.	Ibyo utekereza byose.
You are worried.	Ufite impungenge.
He was not sure what he was going to do.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo agiye gukora.
He has already applied for a job.	Yamaze gusaba akazi.
We have work to do.	Dufite akazi ko gukora.
I think that would be nice.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza.
No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze avuga.
We have to go fast.	Tugomba kugenda vuba.
But he needed it.	Ariko yari akeneye.
But for me it was good.	Ariko kuri njye byari byiza.
No walking around.	Nta kugenda hafi ya.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
I'm glad to stay.	Nishimiye kuguma.
It was a great time to see.	Byari igihe kinini cyo kubona.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
Or me.	Cyangwa nanjye.
But he said nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
He doesn't know what to do.	Ntabwo azi icyo akora.
He did not know exactly who he was.	Ntiyari azi neza uwo ari we.
You have to be good at it.	Ugomba kuba mwiza kuri byo.
I did something wrong.	Nakoze ikintu kibi.
They are all in school.	Bose bari mu ishuri.
She is very embarrassed.	Afite isoni cyane.
You have a problem now!	Ufite ikibazo ubu!
The reason is so many people.	Impamvu ni abantu benshi cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He feels nothing.	Nta cyo yumva.
He said he did not.	Yavuze ko atabikoze.
Really? 	Mubyukuri?
he says.	avuga.
The girl desperately wanted to go.	Umukobwa yashakaga cyane kugenda.
I knew he had the truth.	Nari nzi ko afite ukuri.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
But for him alone.	Ariko kuri we wenyine.
Do you have a book?	Ufite igitabo?
No problem whatsoever.	Nta kibazo icyo aricyo cyose.
I just didn’t understand how.	Gusa sinigeze numva uburyo.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ibintu.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
I didn't see anyone.	Nta muntu nabonye.
And they probably had the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko bari bafite ukuri.
None of us can.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ushobora.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It seems to be true for me.	Birasa naho ari ukuri kuri njye.
He knew how to talk to you.	Yari azi kuvugana nawe.
He got things right.	Yabonye ibintu neza.
Everyone is here.	Abantu bose bari hano.
Here is the truth.	Hano hari ukuri.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
There is something good to know.	Hariho ikintu cyiza cyo kumenya.
But not in this house.	Ariko si muri iyi nzu.
I had both.	Nari mfite bombi.
It was not good for him.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri we.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
There are many opportunities.	Hariho amahirwe menshi.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
I can't do this.	Sinshobora gukora ibi.
You can talk to him.	Urashobora kuvugana na we.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
It was not his time.	Ntabwo yari umwanya we.
But it would be nice.	Ariko byaba byiza.
Living at home or at home.	Kuba mu ngo cyangwa mu nzu.
At the same time.	Mugihe kimwe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But not me.	Ariko ntabwo ari njye.
Probably, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka.
You are a beautiful girl	Uri umukobwa mwiza.
I understand things.	Ndumva ibintu.
That's what he says.	Nibyo avuga.
Are you sure you know what you are doing?	Uzi neza ko uzi ibyo ukora?
In fact, he is more likely to play anything.	Mubyukuri, birashoboka ko ashobora gukina ikintu cyose.
He said he had to leave.	Yavuze ko agomba kugenda.
She likes to be in her room.	Akunda kuba mu cyumba cye.
He was only thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu gusa.
Apparently the girl had a lot to learn.	Biragaragara ko umukobwa yari afite byinshi byo kwiga.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza, ibintu byose byagenze neza.
It's really good, really, really good.	Nibyiza rwose, mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
You have to work.	Ugomba gukora.
That was a simple matter.	Ibyo byari ibintu byoroshye.
You can have what you want.	Urashobora kugira ibyo ushaka.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
I don't know what happened, but it happened.	Ntabwo nzi uko byagenze, ariko byagenze.
It was a good night.	Muri iri joro yari mwiza.
Maybe we can stay there.	Ahari dushobora kuguma aho.
But he is right.	Ariko afite ukuri.
Today.	Uyu munsi.
He should not have said anything.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kugira icyo avuga.
There is truth in truth.	Hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
There is nothing you can do about it right now.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora kuri ubu.
He said everything or nothing.	Yavuze ko byose cyangwa ntacyo.
I didn't know what to think.	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
Anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese.
That he would be talking.	Ko yaba ari kuvugana.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He talks about everything.	Avuga kuri byose.
He didn't want to come here.	Ntiyashakaga kuza hano.
He saw what had happened.	Yabonye uko byagenze.
I'm sorry	Mbabajwe.
We had a family.	Twari dufite umuryango.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari yaje.
You can tell me anything.	Urashobora kumbwira ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
Really good to see.	Nibyiza rwose kubona.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
I don't want anything.	Ntacyo nshaka.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira.
I find this to be untrue.	Njye mbona ibi atari ukuri.
I feel what he feels.	Ndumva ibyo yumva.
It would be difficult.	Byaba bigoye.
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
I mean, you think about what he thinks.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko utekereza icyo atekereza.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
But we can't know for sure.	Ariko ntidushobora kumenya neza.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
You can read it again.	Urashobora kongera gusoma hejuru.
You are too.	Nawe uri.
He is currently working on his book.	Arimo gukora igitabo cye kuri ubu.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
It's all right now.	Ni ibintu byose ubu.
There is something else to do.	Hariho ikindi kintu cyo gukora.
I love it so much.	Nkunda cyane.
He has a lot of money	Afite amafaranga menshi
I have a lot of things.	Mfite ibintu byinshi.
I like to travel a lot.	Nkunda kugenda cyane.
And we have work to do.	Kandi dufite akazi ko gukora.
Right now, you are exactly where you should be.	Kuri ubu, uri neza neza aho ugomba kuba.
Everyone should have friends like him.	Umuntu wese agomba kugira inshuti nka we.
If possible.	Niba bishoboka.
You don't have to work.	Ntugomba gukora.
He asked everyone to leave the room.	Yasabye abantu bose kuva mu cyumba.
Please, please, it's too early.	Nyamuneka, nyamuneka, ni kare cyane.
Until then, there is nothing you can do.	Kugeza icyo gihe, nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora.
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
I know he is right.	Nzi ko afite ukuri.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I can't beat this.	Ntabwo nshobora gutsinda ibi.
It was not a mistake.	Ntabwo byari amakosa.
I had my whole family outside.	Nari mfite umuryango wanjye wose hanze.
He asked where they were.	Yabajije aho bari.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
He knew how to do it right.	Yari azi kubikora neza.
He can do nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe ashobora gukora.
That is why.	Iyo ni yo mpamvu.
I'm really scared.	Mfite ubwoba rwose.
What did you say	Wavuze iki?
But he probably does.	Ariko birashoboka ko abikora.
He knew, however, what to say.	Yari azi, ariko, icyo yari kuvuga.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
I can't eat well.	Ntashobora kurya neza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari njye.
And he never did.	Kandi ntiyigeze agira.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari ko byagenze.
He had been there for three years.	Yari amaze imyaka itatu.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
For me, it was about to happen again.	Kuri njye, yari hafi kongera kubaho.
I wanted to know more.	Nashakaga kumenya neza.
The idea is bad.	Igitekerezo ni kibi.
I know it's true.	Nzi ko ari ukuri.
I don't know what happened.	Sinzi uko byagenze.
He really has to give up all that.	Agomba rwose kureka ibyo byose.
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Obviously this is not the case.	Biragaragara ko iki atari cyo kibazo.
Little by little, if anything.	Gito, niba hari icyo.
It was good to try.	Byari byiza kugerageza.
Well, well, well.	Nibyiza, nibyiza.
When we need it.	Mugihe dukeneye.
He doesn't have much luck.	Ntabwo afite amahirwe menshi.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Yavuze ko ashaka kugura.
But you have.	Ariko ufite.
His reason was good.	Impamvu ye yari nziza.
You are worried.	Ufite impungenge.
But, you have to be really good at it.	Ariko, ugomba kuba ukora neza rwose.
All would be well.	Byose byaba byiza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo byagenze neza.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
He was my friend.	Yari inshuti yanjye.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ntiyari azi ikindi gukora.
They have a good plan.	Bafite gahunda nziza.
None of us can go home now.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ushobora gutaha ubu.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
He did well for a while.	Yakoze neza igihe gito.
I don't know the problem here.	Ntabwo nzi ikibazo hano.
I am a young man now.	Ndi umusore wanjye ubu.
She is worried about him.	Afite impungenge kuri we.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo.
I have to leave this house for a while.	Ngomba kuva muri iyi nzu igihe gito.
I'm the only one here.	Ni njye gusa hano.
Good study!	Kwiga neza!
You can't wait for tonight.	Ntushobora gutegereza iri joro.
But that’s a good thing.	Ariko ni ikintu cyiza.
And there is a gift.	Kandi hariho impano.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
But he did not know for sure.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza.
I had something good.	Nari mfite ikintu cyiza.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
I have a small problem.	Mfite ikibazo gito.
We don't need much.	Ntabwo dukeneye byinshi.
He had gone too far.	Yari yagiye kure cyane.
I mean, we are.	Ndashaka kuvuga, turi.
And for him.	Kandi kuri we.
He knows something.	Hari icyo azi.
Why? 	Kuki?
I'm not good at that.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza kuri ibyo.
I was really good.	Nari mwiza rwose.
You knew it, really.	Wari uzi neza, rwose.
Tell me something else.	Mbwira ikindi kintu.
But there is so much we can do.	Ariko hariho byinshi cyane dushobora gukora.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo.
Are you going to swim?	Ugiye koga?
You have to do it every day.	Ugomba kubikora buri munsi.
I think that was a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari amakosa.
Kandi.	Kandi.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
We really have the same idea.	Dufite rwose igitekerezo kimwe.
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
He tried to do things right.	Yagerageje gukora ibintu neza.
There is so much to do!	Hariho byinshi byo gukora!
I knew exactly what he meant.	Nari nzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I saw the same problem.	Nabonye ikibazo kimwe.
There is something you need to know.	Hariho ikintu ugomba kumenya.
Not too high, not too low.	Ntabwo ari hejuru cyane, ntabwo ari hasi cyane.
Good things.	Ibintu byiza.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
And he probably did.	Kandi birashoboka ko yabikoze.
But I want to do it right.	Ariko ndashaka kubikora neza.
But this is not the case.	Ariko si ibi.
He was a good child.	Yari umwana mwiza.
Sometimes, other times really.	Rimwe na rimwe, ikindi gihe rwose.
You have to be that way.	Ugomba kuba uko.
But this is clear from the beginning.	Ariko ibi biragaragara rwose kuva mbere.
I didn't see much.	Ntabwo nabonye byinshi.
Now I don’t want to play at all.	Ubu ntashaka gukina na gato.
I like to be at home.	Nkunda kuba murugo.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
Just being.	Kuba gusa.
Outside of him.	Hanze ye.
The dog didn't come.	Imbwa ntabwo yaje.
I’m working on the same thing right now.	Ndimo gukora ku kintu kimwe kuri ubu.
She was beautiful now.	Ubu yari mwiza.
I have a lot of faith.	Ndizera cyane.
But, it was a wonderful experience.	Ariko, byari ibintu byiza cyane.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
It's close.	Ari hafi.
It's not like he has anything to say.	Ntabwo ari nkaho hari icyo ashaka kuvuga.
That's what we all need.	Ibyo twese dukeneye.
It was his fault.	Byari amakosa ye.
And it was high.	Kandi byari hejuru.
I think that's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ibintu byiza.
But no one had said why.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe yari yabwiye impamvu.
But he thought well.	Ariko yatekereje neza.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta cyo byari cyo.
The inside is outside, the outside is inside.	Imbere ni hanze, hanze iri imbere.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo sibyo.
He came to play.	Yaje gukina.
Everyone is fine.	Umuntu wese agira neza.
There is something here for everyone.	Hano hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
He said he never understood what he meant.	Yavuze ko atigeze yumva neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
That's not what happened.	Ntabwo aribyo byagenze.
He said what he knew.	Yavuze ibyo azi.
It's really nice to be back here.	Nibyiza rwose gusubira hano.
The question is when.	Ikibazo ni ryari.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, ntabwo byari ibiryo.
At home.	Murugo.
He was not the one he wanted to be.	Ntabwo yari uwo yashakaga kuba.
I know what he would do.	Nzi icyo yari gukora.
You have to stay.	Ugomba kuguma.
We are a family.	Turi umuryango.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
And that will happen.	Kandi ibyo bizaba.
If it were normal.	Niba byari bisanzwe.
The space is great.	Umwanya ni mwiza.
Right now, that's right.	Kuri ubu, nibyo.
I guess this one.	Ndakeka yuko iyi.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira nonaha.
He went too high.	Yagiye hejuru cyane.
He sits there every day.	Yicaye aho buri munsi.
It's a long time.	Ni igihe kirekire.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko byagenze neza.
And all together.	Kandi bose hamwe.
However, it is clear that you are very worried.	Ariko, biragaragara ko ufite impungenge nyinshi.
He started telling me what had happened that day.	Yatangiye kumbwira uko byagenze uwo munsi.
How to ‘live’.	Uburyo bwo 'kubaho'.
We really need to talk.	Dukeneye rwose kuvuga.
He may not see anything.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo ashobora kubona.
And you are alone.	Kandi uri wenyine.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko.
Kandi.	Kandi.
If you know you are wrong.	Niba uzi ko ufite amakosa.
His wife was not.	Umugore we ntabwo yari.
He thought we could be friends.	Yatekereje ko dushobora kuba inshuti.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
He just didn't know what to do.	Gusa ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora byose.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
And that's what you like.	Kandi nibyo ukunda.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
I never thought of one.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza kuri kimwe.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
He has a plan.	Afite gahunda.
He seemed to be right about that.	Yasaga naho ari ukuri kuri ibyo.
I mean everything, man.	Ndashaka kuvuga ikintu cyose, muntu.
I guess you have something for me.	Ndakeka ko hari icyo ushaka kuri njye.
It's good outside.	Nibyiza hanze.
He had a job in the morning.	Yari afite akazi mu gitondo.
They are all here!	Bose bari hano!
It was not a house.	Ntabwo yari inzu.
None of us had.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari ufite.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
Most of the time you can do it yourself.	Igihe kinini ushobora kubikora wenyine.
You did it.	Wabikoze.
This room is very small.	Iki cyumba ni gito cyane.
We needed everyone.	Twari dukeneye abantu bose.
I got to eat.	Nabonye kurya.
In.	Muri.
That's a great idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko atagomba kubikora.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
There are times.	Hari igihe.
That is, it is.	Ni, icyo aricyo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
There is a lot to carry.	Hariho byinshi byo gutwara.
He must be right.	Agomba kuba afite ukuri.
One and only.	Umwe kandi wenyine.
But the big thing is.	Ariko ikintu kinini ni iki.
I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl.	Ndi umukobwa muto, umukobwa muto ni njye.
He needed to be alone, he needed time to think.	Yari akeneye kuba wenyine, akeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
Same as before.	Kimwe nka mbere.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, birashoboka cyane.
Time is money.	Igihe ni amafaranga.
Everyone has their own opinion.	Umuntu wese afite igitekerezo cye.
I do not mean.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga.
But all this time, it will be difficult.	Ariko iki gihe cyose, ibyo bizaba bigoye.
He said he was really good.	Yavuze ko yari mwiza rwose.
An outsider is worried.	Umuntu uri hanze afite impungenge.
We have the opportunity to live.	Dufite amahirwe yo kubaho.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
Where did he go?	Yagiye he?
He was good to her and a good person.	Yari mwiza kuri we n'umuntu mwiza.
At home, at school.	Murugo, ku ishuri.
But he hadn't been home in a long time.	Ariko ntabwo yari amaze igihe kinini murugo.
Or you can stay where you are.	Cyangwa urashobora kuguma neza aho uri.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
It's just there now.	Hariho gusa ubu.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
Being here all this time.	Kuba hano muri iki gihe cyose.
He said another time.	Yavuze ko ikindi gihe.
I mean, you're a friend too.	Ndashaka kuvuga, nawe ni inshuti.
He never heard of anything.	Nta kintu yigeze yumva.
He didn't want anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga.
It's a good idea to have.	Ni ikibazo cyiza kugira.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It was not crowded.	Ntiyari abantu benshi.
We had one of those.	Twari dufite kimwe muri ibyo.
Inside as well as outside.	Imbere kimwe no hanze.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I want it now.	Ndashaka ubu.
He was sure he was thinking or something.	Yari azi neza ko arimo gutekereza cyangwa ikindi kintu.
They had no time.	Ntabwo bari bafite umwanya.
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko.
But that is not the case now.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo ubu.
He didn’t even need to try.	Ntiyari akeneye no kugerageza.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
You have to look at that.	Ugomba kureba ibyo.
This is really great.	Ibi rwose ni byiza cyane.
I knew he had problems.	Nari nzi ko afite ibibazo.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
He did nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yakoze.
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
More and more.	Byinshi kandi byinshi.
I know it's not good.	Nzi ko atari byiza.
You are human.	Uri umuntu.
This is especially true.	Iyi cyane cyane.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
He looked worried.	Yarebye impungenge.
He didn't need the money.	Ntiyari akeneye amafaranga.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
Everyone was alone.	Umuntu wese yari wenyine.
And she knew full well that she was not a little girl.	Kandi yari azi neza ko atari umukobwa muto.
Definitely not where I thought it would be.	Rwose ntabwo ari aho natekerezaga.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
They have a car you have.	Bafite imodoka ufite.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo aribyo.
And so should you.	Kandi nawe ugomba kuba.
He doesn't talk much.	Ntabwo avuga cyane.
'	'
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
You are doing well.	Ukora neza.
Do you have a dog?	Ufite imbwa?
And on schedule.	Kandi kuri gahunda.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
I have a problem.	Mfite ikibazo.
They have a reason.	Bafite impamvu.
Swimming a lot.	Koga cyane.
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
However, a woman.	Ariko kandi, umugore.
I have to go to work.	Ngomba kujya ku kazi.
However, it is not very easy.	Ariko, ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
It was good, as usual.	Byari byiza, nkuko bisanzwe.
I want to live.	Ndashaka kubaho.
Or maybe he had something else.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari afite ikindi kintu.
Really, really bad.	Mubyukuri, mubi rwose.
You need a good book.	Ukeneye igitabo cyiza.
He started eating badly.	Yatangiye kurya nabi.
I have to go and take my daughter.	Ngomba kujya gufata umukobwa wanjye.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
He had gone as far as him.	Yari yagiye kure nka we.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Nari nzi neza icyo ashaka.
He was a young child.	Yari umwana muto.
He has nothing.	Ntacyo afite.
It is not my gift.	Ntabwo ari impano yanjye.
Absolutely.	Hariho rwose.
It was difficult to know what it was.	Byari bigoye kumenya icyo ari cyo.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It would not be good for him.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza kuri we.
Come on.	Hasi.
A little higher.	Hejuru gato.
He thought he was a good person.	Yatekereje ko ari umuntu mwiza.
Going forward.	Kugenda imbere.
I have to hear.	Ngomba kumva.
He would not say that.	Ntabwo yari kuvuga uko.
In fact, he is right about everything.	Mubyukuri, avuga neza ibintu byose.
I don't want to stay in this house.	Sinshaka kuguma muri iyi nzu.
You can find what you want there.	Urashobora kubona icyo ushaka aho.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
But there was nothing that one could do.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe umuntu yari gukora.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
There was nothing he could do about it right now.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora ubu.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I would just walk away.	Nari kugenda gusa.
But he has to have time.	Ariko agomba kugira umwanya.
You can find what you like.	Urashobora kubona ibyo ukunda.
He did not know when he could work.	Ntabwo yari azi igihe yashoboraga gukora.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
Do you want to be my friend?	Urashaka kuba inshuti yanjye?.
You don't have to tell anyone.	Ntugomba kubwira umuntu.
I felt it was great.	Numvise ko ari byiza cyane.
He can say what he wants.	Arashobora kuvuga icyo ashaka.
It's really bad.	Ni mubi rwose.
This is my favorite movie.	Iyi ni firime nkunda.
They were all above him.	Bose bari hejuru ye.
It was not for me.	Ntabwo byari kuri njye.
He was your son.	Yari umuhungu wawe.
If you don't want to do it.	Niba udashaka kubikora.
Outside is outside.	Hanze ni hanze.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You too.	Nawe.
However, there is more.	Ariko, hariho byinshi.
But I can't go back now.	Ariko ntashobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
I think he likes the idea.	Ntekereza ko akunda igitekerezo.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
He didn't look at anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yarebye.
He just needed a chance.	Yari akeneye amahirwe gusa.
That's what you do best.	Nibyo ukora byiza.
Everything was normal.	Ibintu byose byari bisanzwe.
That's not the problem right now.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo ubu.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
We have to stop this now.	Tugomba guhagarika ibi nonaha.
No one did it.	Nta n'umwe wabikoze.
This was definitely true for me.	Ibi rwose byari ukuri kuri njye.
And this is good.	Kandi ibi ni byiza.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
He has time to live.	Afite igihe cyo kubaho.
I got the money.	Nabonye amafaranga.
We have to work now.	Tugomba gukora ubu.
Only us at that time.	Gusa natwe icyo gihe.
You should not eat too much.	Ntugomba kurya byinshi.
His advice was good.	Inama ye yari nziza.
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
This was my place.	Uyu wari umwanya wanjye.
I mean this.	Ndashaka kuvuga ibi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But he was gone for the day.	Ariko yari yagiye ku munsi.
I guess not.	Ndakeka ko atari byo.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
He was very far from her.	Yari kure cyane ye.
He loved his money.	Yakundaga amafaranga ye.
No one is in school.	Nta muntu uri mu ishuri.
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
He was well aware that he was not.	Yari azi neza ko nta.
Leaving and returning.	Kureka no gutaha.
He bought a book.	Yaguze igitabo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
But now there is something else.	Ariko ubu hariho ikindi kintu.
If it is not one thing, it is another.	Niba atari ikintu kimwe, ni ikindi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He heard nothing.	Nta cyo yumvise.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
I finally saw this thing.	Amaherezo nabonye iki kintu.
He is a bad person.	Ni umuntu mubi.
But on !!!.	Ariko kuri !!!.
But he was not young.	Ariko ntabwo yari akiri muto.
He may even have.	Ashobora no kugira.
But he had gone too far.	Ariko yari yagiye kure.
He was now behind her.	Ubu yari inyuma ye.
That is something else.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu.
Not at this time.	Ntabwo ari iki gihe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It's too young	Ndi muto
Obviously.	Biragaragara rwose.
He was here before.	Yari hano mbere.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
From the room.	Kuva mu cyumba.
You can't wait to see that.	Ntushobora gutegereza kubona ibyo.
But obviously you are also a good person.	Ariko biragaragara ko nawe uri umuntu mwiza.
That's right.	Nukuri.
He looked behind her.	Yarebye inyuma ye.
The party was really good, but it wasn't good.	Ibirori nibyiza rwose, ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
But he did not know why.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza impamvu.
Me too, man.	Nanjye, muntu.
I have problems.	Mfite ibibazo.
He never had.	Ntiyigeze agira.
This is true.	Ubu ni ukuri.
We needed a good plan.	Twari dukeneye gahunda nziza.
How can I do that?	Nigute nshobora kubikora.
I know a guy, really.	Nzi umusore, mubyukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu byoroshye.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Where do you want to go?	Urashaka kujya he?
You are one.	Uri umwe.
This is not always true.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari ukuri.
We have to go, to go is to go.	Tugomba kugenda, kugenda ni kugenda.
He wanted to know why.	Yashakaga kumenya impamvu.
I just think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza gusa.
Not only that, but it's good.	Gusa, ariko nibyiza.
He is my dog.	Ni imbwa yanjye.
He told me he could never work.	Yambwiye ko adashobora na rimwe gukora.
I mean, you don't have to say anything.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntacyo ukeneye kuvuga.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
I'm sure you can do it.	Nzi neza ko ushobora kubikora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza bisanzwe, byari byiza rwose.
At times, faith was the same thing.	Rimwe na rimwe, kwizera ni kimwe umuntu yari afite.
If he wants to talk, he can go ahead.	Niba ashaka kuvuga, arashobora kugenda mbere.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
I love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa.
He was not a family.	Ntabwo yari umuryango.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
It is possible to win.	Birashoboka gutsinda.
I had this.	Nari mfite ibi.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
And that was all, really.	Kandi ibyo byari byose, rwose.
This was good for me.	Ibi byari byiza kuri njye.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
He had a house.	Yari afite inzu.
You were worried there.	Wari ufite impungenge aho.
He is my son.	Ni umuhungu wanjye.
It's too young.	Ni muto cyane.
I thought we had.	Natekereje ko dufite.
You probably did.	Birashoboka ko wabikoze.
I don’t have to try too hard, it’s good for me.	Ntabwo ngomba kugerageza cyane, nibyiza kuri njye.
He has something for him.	Afite ikintu kuri we.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
We have to do it again.	Tugomba kongera kubikora.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
I was on my own.	Nari kuri njye.
I am his son.	Ndi umuhungu we.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora kuri ibi.
It is not very good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza cyane.
I told no one.	Nta muntu nabwiye.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
He should be ashamed.	Agomba kugira isoni.
He did.	Yabikoze.
You are not included.	Ntabwo urimo.
Now he needs money.	Ubu akeneye amafaranga.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
In that case, it will be better.	Icyo gihe, bizaba byiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I couldn't figure out how to do it.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kumenya neza uko wabikoze.
To see	Kureba.
You just want to make sure they know it well.	Gusa ushaka kwizera ko bazi neza.
Let it be.	Reka niba.
I can't talk to him.	Sinshobora kuvugana na we.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
Me? 	Ninjye?
But that is not all.	Ariko si ibi gusa.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
But what he told me was enough.	Ariko ibyo yambwiye byari bihagije.
What he did well, he did well.	Ibyo yakoze neza, yakoze neza.
And he was just sitting there.	Kandi yari yicaye gusa.
He was young, 20 years old.	Yari akiri muto, afite imyaka 20.
You have to understand exactly what you want.	Ugomba kumva neza icyo ushaka.
It's all about him.	Ni byose kuri we.
Sometimes he doesn't know where he is.	Hari igihe atazi iyo ari.
He had done nothing wrong, he could see.	Nta kibi yari yakoze, yashoboraga kubona.
Out here	Hanze aha.
Not close, but close.	Ntabwo ari hafi, ariko hafi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was a beautiful day.	Uwo munsi yari mwiza cyane.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
Friend to take a job.	Inshuti yo gufata akazi.
He was swimming a lot.	Yari koga cyane.
We don't need to talk.	Ntabwo dukeneye kuvuga.
That sounds great.	Ibyo birasa cyane.
Everyone needs help.	Umuntu wese akeneye ubufasha.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
He was only right about one thing.	Yari afite ukuri gusa ku kintu kimwe.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
No plans.	Nta gahunda.
Her hair was beautiful and beautiful.	Umusatsi we wari mwiza kandi mwiza cyane.
Or maybe they had.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko bari bafite.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
You can do a lot of things.	Urashobora gukora ibintu byinshi.
It was like a prison.	Byari nka gereza.
I wonder what they have to eat.	Ndabaza icyo bafite cyo kurya.
That's not all, it's possible.	Ntabwo aribyo byose, birashoboka.
Not many.	Nta benshi.
But that was not the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari ibi.
He really needs a good time.	Akeneye rwose igihe cyiza.
I have a friend.	Mfite inshuti.
To know	Kumenya.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I just don't feel good about myself.	Gusa ntabwo numva ari byiza kuri njye.
You can do it again.	Urashobora kongera kubikora.
Why are there so many?	Kuki hariho benshi?
Or too much more than that.	Cyangwa byinshi cyane kurenza ibyo.
He should not have been here.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kuba hano.
He had to do it.	Yagombaga kubikora.
This will be tomorrow.	Ibi bizaba ejo.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
There is something here.	Hano hari ikintu.
That's not what he needed to hear.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu yari akeneye kumva.
In fact, it's really good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
I was a very nice person once.	Nari umuntu mwiza cyane rimwe.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
New car.	Imodoka nshya.
You can do it now.	Urashobora kubikora ubu.
The first day was beautiful.	Umunsi wa mbere wari mwiza.
If they have.	Niba bafite.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
There are good things here.	Hano hari ibintu byiza.
You can do it or you can't.	Urashobora kubikora cyangwa ntushobora.
I was looking for something else.	Nashakaga ikindi kintu.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
It was not good for him.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri we.
Have a short time to see everything else.	Kugira umwanya muto wo kubona ikindi kintu cyose.
They were friends.	Bari inshuti.
He has everything.	Afite ibintu byose.
He went to work.	Yagiye ku kazi.
I'm not good at this.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza kuri ibi.
It is much smaller than normal.	Ari muto cyane kurenza uko bisanzwe.
She may be embarrassed.	Birashoboka ko agira isoni.
The girl is not what she looks like.	Umukobwa ntabwo aribyo asa.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
No one was in front of him.	Nta muntu wari imbere ye.
You have to have a car obviously.	Ugomba kugira imodoka biragaragara.
He wanted to take time.	Yashakaga gufata umwanya.
He was no longer there.	Ntiyari akiri aho.
That was not enough for us.	Ntabwo byari bihagije kuri twe.
I want everything.	Ndashaka byose.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
He is not his son.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu we.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
But you can't.	Ariko ntushobora.
You work hard.	Ukora cyane.
She loved the party.	Yakundaga ibirori.

Same with me.	Kimwe nanjye.
For me it is possible.	Kuri njye birashoboka.
I have to be scared.	Ngomba kugira ubwoba.
Where he knew it was.	Aho yari azi ko ari.
At the meeting, he said that things were going well.	Mu nama, yavuze ko ibintu byagenze neza.
We are very much ahead now.	Turi imbere cyane ubu.
He took your time.	Yafashe umwanya wawe.
There is a chance.	Hari amahirwe.
But we need to do that.	Ariko dukeneye kubikora.
I was really bad.	Nari mubi rwose.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva ari ikintu.
He may have.	Ashobora kuba afite.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hafi ya bose.
I'm glad it's not me.	Nishimiye ko abikora atari njye.
I mean, it's just a day.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ni umunsi gusa.
All or nothing.	Byose cyangwa ntacyo.

Come on.	Hasi.
We are one.	Turi umwe.
I'm sure he is.	Nzi neza ko ari we.
You have to think hard.	Ugomba gutekereza cyane.
You don’t have to stay alone.	Ntagomba kuguma wenyine.
John had to go.	Yohana yagombaga kugenda.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
I heard him go.	Numvise agenda.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari byiza.
Not many of us.	Ntabwo ari benshi muri twe.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
He must be, like me, three years old.	Agomba kuba, nkanjye, afite imyaka itatu.
I'm pretty sure he'll do it.	Mbwira neza uko azabikora.
You have to look at people.	Ugomba kureba abantu.
I felt close.	Numvise hafi.
You can't do things.	Ntushobora gukora ibintu.

In fact, he is right.	Mubyukuri, rwose afite ukuri.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I didn't think of anything.	Ntabwo natekerezaga ku kintu.
I think it's a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ari amakosa.
Where did he go?	Yagiye he?
He just wanted to play with her.	Yashakaga gusa gukina na we.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
There is so much to do and say.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora no kuvuga.
I think it is, a little.	Ntekereza ko ari, gato.
I need to be with you	Nkeneye kubana nawe.
That's really good.	Nibyo rwose nibyiza.
Probably.	Birashoboka.

It would be difficult.	Byari kuba bigoye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Tell me what he said.	Mbwira icyo yavuze.

Apparently he knew where they were.	Biragaragara ko yari azi aho bari.
Trying to figure out why.	Kugerageza kumenya impamvu.

I want to play again.	Ndashaka gusubira gukina.
I can get to know everyone.	Nshobora kumenya abantu bose.
It wasn’t much to say.	Ntabwo byari byinshi byo kuvuga.
Many are just scared.	Benshi bafite ubwoba gusa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Another problem.	Ikindi kibazo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He began to hear.	Yatangiye kumva.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
The children are inside the house.	Abana bari imbere mu nzu.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
She is now a beautiful home.	Ubu niwe murugo mwiza.
And you got to do it.	Kandi wabonye kubikora.

That's not the case with me.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri njye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But that’s the thing.	Ariko ni ibintu.
I think he is right.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri.
Did you see that movie?	Wabonye iyo firime?
And it was a bad thing.	Kandi byari byagenze nabi.

There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
He looked worried.	Yarebye afite impungenge.
You have to go to work.	Ugomba kujya ku kazi.
He needed to say more.	Yari akeneye kuvuga byinshi.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
He had no money.	Ntiyari afite amafaranga.
Maybe even in the house.	Ahari no mu nzu.
Me too.	Nanjye.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.

He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
I'm glad to be alone.	Nishimiye kuba wenyine.
And that's a good thing.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
Now everyone has one.	Ubu buri wese afite umwe.
You can do it easily here.	Urashobora kubikora byoroshye hano.
He really wanted to go.	Yashakaga cyane kugenda.
There’s a lot to go on.	Hariho byinshi byo kugenda.
He says he has to leave.	Avuga ko agomba kugenda.
The clothes were not good.	Imyenda ntiyari nziza.
I had a family.	Nari mfite umuryango.
And on no.	Kandi kuri no.
I really want this.	Ndashaka rwose ibi.
He did nothing.	Nta cyo yakoze.
I am very happy to buy.	Nishimiye cyane kugura.
He has nothing to say.	Ntabwo agomba kugira icyo avuga.
Not here.	Nta na hano.
Very nice guy	Umusore mwiza cyane.
However, I am not sure why.	Ariko, sinzi neza impamvu byagenze.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko kimwe.
I don't.	Ntabwo.
He went a long way with a lot of money.	Yagiye kure afite amafaranga menshi.
I know you are.	Nzi ko uri.
I now have a job.	Ubu mfite akazi.
You did it.	Wabikoze.
That was easy for me.	Ibyo byari ibintu byoroshye kuri njye.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
I can help.	Nshobora gufasha.
But they were out.	Ariko bari hanze.
Who do you like the most ?.	Ninde ukunda cyane?.
This is obviously true.	Ibi biragaragara ko ari ukuri.
He had nothing to lose.	Ntacyo yari afite cyo gusubira inyuma.
Most do not.	Byinshi ntabwo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That was a great thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza cyane.
That's what he thought.	Icyo ni cyo yatekerezaga.
Car.	Imodoka.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
They didn’t know it and it was easy.	Ntabwo bari bazi kandi byoroshye.
He can stay.	Arashobora kuguma.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
You had a problem.	Wari ufite ikibazo.
But obviously not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari byo.
That’s not a good dog.	Iyo si imbwa nziza.
It's a house.	Ni inzu.
I don't want to do this.	Sinshaka gukora ibi.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
I believe.	Ndizera.
Great idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
I was looking for a wife.	Nashakaga umugore.
He just tried to help and be nice.	Yagerageje gusa gufasha no kuba mwiza.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
It was under you.	Yari munsi yawe.
But there is no one here.	Ariko hano nta muntu n'umwe.
But recently.	Ariko vuba aha.
I didn’t think it was good.	Sinatekerezaga ko byari byiza.
Is this a person?	Uyu ni umuntu?
What he could do.	Ibyo yashoboraga gukora.
It seems.	Birasa.
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
It was good to try.	Byari byiza kugerageza.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
It was easy and good.	Byari byoroshye kandi byiza.
He needs to regain his faith.	Akeneye kongera kwizera.
I saw it now.	Nabonye ubu.
This morning it was really easy.	Muri iki gitondo byoroshye rwose.
In, almost, below.	Muri, hafi, munsi.
I saw something else.	Nabonye ikindi kintu.
But at a young age, she was a very beautiful girl.	Ariko akiri muto, yari umukobwa mwiza cyane.
However, you can see that this is not the case.	Ariko, urashobora kubona ko atari byo.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
I don't need anything.	Ntacyo nkeneye.
Not one.	Ntabwo ari umwe.
I was a young man.	Nari umusore.
When someone has the same problem.	Mugihe mugihe umuntu afite ikibazo kimwe.
That's when he looked down.	Icyo gihe ni bwo yarebye hasi.
Only this time it was not.	Gusa iki gihe ntabwo byari.
I need another time.	Nkeneye ikindi gihe.
And that’s not normal.	Kandi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I can't even say.	Sinshobora no kuvuga.
From there.	Kuva aho.
There is a family here.	Hano hari umuryango.
This is not easy though.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye ariko.
I know a guy who looks like that.	Nzi umusore usa.
No looking.	Nta kureba.
I never thought it was you.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ari wowe.
I know what you're doing.	Nzi ibyo ukora.
I think it's really good.	Ntekereza ko ari mwiza rwose.
The only woman he loved.	Umugore wenyine yakundaga.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
He just wanted to drink the same.	Yashakaga gusa kunywa kimwe.
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
Ninde.	Ninde.
You would do it.	Wari kubikora.
But his money was gone.	Ariko amafaranga ye yari yagiye.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I've been there for a long time.	Ndimo igihe kirekire.
It's not something you can buy.	Ntabwo ari ikintu ushobora kugura.
You really have to go where people are.	Ugomba rwose kujya aho abantu bari.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari uwo.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Uwo ni we uri hejuru.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
Maybe a little earlier.	Ahari mbere gato.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
And he is not a bad person or anything else.	Kandi ntabwo ari umuntu mubi cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
I have never seen him do that with anyone.	Sinigeze mbona akora ibyo hamwe numuntu.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
I always think.	Ntekereza buri gihe.
And he was.	Kandi yari.
Most people don’t.	Abantu benshi ntabwo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we yari afite.
He is in front of her.	Ari imbere ye.
So far, she feels good.	Kugeza ubu, yumva ari byiza.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
He was on the phone.	Yari kuri terefone.
She was absolutely lucky!	Yagize amahirwe rwose!.
Not all of them have.	Ntabwo bose bafite.
That was a great thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza cyane.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
You just got lucky.	Wabonye amahirwe gusa.
We were in prison.	Twari muri gereza.
It's true for me.	Ni ukuri kuri njye.
I just believe.	Ndizera gusa.
He went to school and to school.	Yagiye ku ishuri no mu ishuri.
Someone is behind me.	Umuntu ari inyuma yanjye.
I'm sure it will be normal and good.	Nzi neza ko bizaba bisanzwe kandi byiza.
It's not a good read.	Ntabwo ari gusoma neza.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora gutya.
He was not human.	Ntabwo yari umuntu.
He thought he was ready.	Yatekereje ko yiteguye.
Not much to see.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo kubona.
He thought of every bad thing.	Yatekerezaga kuri buri kintu kibi.
Something we need to do.	Ikintu dukeneye gukora.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
It looks like.	Birasa nkaho.
He may have.	Arashobora kugira.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He had gone to his room.	Yari yagiye mu cyumba cye.
Maybe he's looking away, or hearing.	Birashoboka ko arimo kureba kure, cyangwa kumva.
He went away from you.	Yagiye kure yawe.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
This is just the truth.	Ibi ni ukuri gusa.
She had a problem getting a job.	Yagize ikibazo cyo kubona akazi.
When you have a problem, we have a problem.	Iyo ufite ikibazo, dufite ikibazo.
Not one of them.	Ntabwo ari kimwe muri byo.
He could see his friend from afar.	Yashoboraga kubona inshuti ye kure.
In fact, you should not.	Mubyukuri, ntugomba.
I had finally found my place.	Amaherezo nari nabonye umwanya wanjye.
I don't know what they were.	Sinzi icyo bari cyo.
'	'
He was a really good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza rwose.
But if that were true.	Ariko niba byari ukuri.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
Not if he's going to find something.	Ntabwo niba agiye gushaka ikintu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And that's not the case.	Kandi ntabwo aribyo.
You can take your time.	Urashobora gufata umwanya wawe.
Everything.	Byose.
He was where he was.	Yari aho yari ari.
Do we need to say more ?.	Dukeneye kuvuga byinshi?.
The problems were normal.	Ibibazo byari bisanzwe.
She is terrified.	Afite ubwoba bwo hejuru.
The house is beautiful.	Inzu ni nziza.
He knew he wasn't.	Yari azi ko atari we.
Everything.	Byose.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza cyane ibyo uzi.
I made my clothes.	Nakoze imyenda yanjye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He used to say what he thought.	Yakundaga kuvuga icyo atekereza.
He is the highest man.	Niwe muntu wo hejuru.
And for how long.	Kandi kugeza ryari.
Well, the guy is me.	Nibyo, umusore ni njye.
Someone said he would drink.	Umuntu yavuze ko yari kunywa.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
All the children had a new car.	Abana bose bari bafite imodoka nshya.
It's outside.	Ni hanze.
He was a young man.	Yari umusore muto.
There is a reason.	Hariho impamvu.
But he probably isn't.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari we.
Yari.	Yari.
He went this morning.	Yagiye muri iki gitondo.
It was you.	Wari wowe.
I feel right. 	Numva ari ukuri. 
Not to mention.	Nta kuvuga.
But that is a long way off.	Ariko ibyo ni kure cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He didn't want to play with me.	Ntiyashakaga gukina nanjye.
There is something here.	Hano hari kimwe hano.
It seems difficult.	Birasa naho bigoye.
I felt bad.	Numvise nabi.
We would not have won anything.	Ntabwo twari gutsinda ikintu na kimwe.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
Everything was great.	Byose byari byiza cyane.
He just saw it.	Yabonye gusa.
You have to think fast.	Ugomba gutekereza vuba.
He couldn't think of it at the moment.	Ntabwo yashoboraga gutekereza kuri iki gihe.
My house.	Inzu yanjye.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
I mean bad. 	Ndashaka kuvuga nabi. 
The hair was on top.	Umusatsi wari hejuru.
But this one time.	Ariko ibi rimwe.
Where were you	Wari uri he.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi bishoboka.
Just look.	Kureba gusa.
In this, I am in my house.	Muri iyi, ndi mu nzu yanjye.
Can he do it? 	Ashobora kubikora?
Up here.	Hejuru hano.
All of us today.	Ari twese muri iki gihe.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
You can't tell time.	Ntushobora kubwira umwanya.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He knew what he was talking about later.	Yari azi icyo avuga nyuma.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari igihe kinini nibyo.
No one was ready.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari yiteguye.
There is a car inside.	Hano hari imodoka imbere.
But he was scared.	Ariko yari afite ubwoba.
You can buy anything.	Urashobora kugura ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
And every day.	Kandi buri munsi.
I have to try to stop that.	Ngomba kugerageza guhagarika ibyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
But it is a long time coming.	Ariko ni igihe kirekire.
Out front.	Hanze imbere.
It was not recently.	Ntabwo yari vuba aha.
I was not sure what.	Sinari nzi neza icyo.
And not much time.	Kandi nta gihe kinini.
It was not a school.	Ntabwo yari ishuri.
They were behind.	Bari inyuma.
He likes to do it.	Akunda kubikora.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
He was ready for anything.	Yari yiteguye ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I can drive, drive, and do it.	Nshobora gutwara, gutwara, no kubikora.
Lots.	Byinshi.
You just want to look.	Urashaka kureba gusa.
He doesn't know the truth.	Ntabwo azi neza ukuri.
He used to be far away.	Yakundaga kuba kure.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
Not that he ever said much.	Ntabwo ari uko yigeze avuga byinshi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko umuntu adashobora gukora ikindi kintu cyose ariko gufata.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
That was good for him.	Ko byari byiza kuri we.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
I wanted to do it now.	Nashakaga kubikora nonaha.
You have problems.	Ufite ibibazo.
It works well on its own.	Akora neza wenyine.
And here.	Kandi hano.
Anyway, here.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hano.
'	'
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu ntabwo yambaye neza.
I need to do something.	Nkeneye kugira icyo nkora.
Just look.	Kureba gusa.
He says a lot.	Avuga byinshi.
You never wanted anything else.	Ntabwo wigeze ushaka ikindi kintu.
Only one person did it.	Umuntu umwe gusa ni we wabikoze.
He absolutely has to do it.	Agomba kubikora rwose.
It was really hard.	Rwose byari bigoye.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
Outside of you.	Hanze yawe.
He said it was his opinion.	Yavuze ko ari igitekerezo cye.
That's not easy.	Ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
It's not since he's gone.	Ntabwo ari kuva yagiye.
Mostly, in fact.	Byinshi, mubyukuri.
She can swim.	Arashobora koga.
I was in.	Nari ndimo.
You can't stay here.	Ntushobora kuguma hano.
I'm not sure.	Ntazi neza.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
You don't like work.	Ntabwo ukunda akazi.
I thought we were lucky.	Natekereje ko dufite amahirwe.
He wanted to play.	Yashakaga gukina.
He is always ready to help people.	Buri gihe aba yiteguye gufasha abantu.
He was not ready that day.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye uwo munsi.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko ari ukuri.
Leave a comment.	Kureka igitekerezo.
I know exactly what happened.	Nzi neza uko byagenze.
It will be good for me.	Bizaba byiza kuri njye.
He was a family.	Yari umuryango.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
And that's exactly what you want.	Kandi nibyo ushaka.
I have a baby.	Mfite umwana.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
All you have to do is believe.	Ukeneye kwizera gusa.
Bombi.	Bombi.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
It's great to watch.	Nibyiza cyane kureba.
If that were the case, he would have been here earlier.	Niba aribyo byoroshye, yari kuba hano kare.
She said she felt alone.	Yavuze ko yumva ari wenyine.
But one must.	Ariko umuntu agomba.
I don't believe much.	Ntabwo nizera cyane.
He would not know what it was.	Ntabwo yari kumenya icyo aricyo.
He didn’t like to drink too much.	Ntabwo yakundaga kunywa cyane.
I don't want to know things.	Sinshaka kumenya ibintu.
We have to go now.	Tugomba kugenda ubu.
You know what it is.	Uzi icyo aricyo.
He is in me.	Ari muri njye.
And, yes.	Kandi, ni.
That was enough.	Byari bihagije.
We really should.	Tugomba rwose.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
Well, it was good.	Nibyo, byari byiza.
She sat in awe.	Yicaye afite ubwoba.
.	.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I was not good.	Ntabwo nari mwiza.
This one is possible.	Uyu birashoboka.
Can't you talk to yourself?	Ntushobora kuvugana nawe wenyine?
Either way, what he said was not true.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ibyo yavuze ntabwo byari ukuri.
We have to go back now.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma ubu.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
I have to go home.	Ngomba gutaha.
He didn’t have it now, but he would have done it sooner.	Ntabwo yari afite ubu, ariko yari kubikora vuba.
He was a dog.	Yari imbwa.
I am human, and we need things.	Ndi umuntu, kandi dukeneye ibintu.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
They were going to leave soon.	Bari kugenda vuba.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
His young wife was alone in the house.	Umugore we muto yari wenyine mu nzu.
You know what you're up to here.	Uzi icyo urimo hano.
He saw it very badly.	Yabonye nabi cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
'	'
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari gato.
The guy was scared, but not me.	Umusore yagize ubwoba, ariko ntabwo ari njye.
Not really there.	Ntabwo rwose ahari.
For me, money is nothing.	Kuri njye, amafaranga ntacyo.
There were many of us that day.	Uwo munsi twari benshi.
I know why you're here.	Nzi impamvu uri hano.
I didn't think so.	Sinatekerezaga ko ahari.
He had done nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yari yakoze.
But he didn't need to.	Ariko ntiyari akeneye.
I really can't.	Sinshobora rwose.
I hope they would say the same about me.	Nizera ko bari kuvuga kimwe kuri njye.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ni umukobwa mwiza.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
Yes, that was the day.	Nibyo, uyu wari umunsi.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
Nowhere.	Nta na hamwe.
That's all you need to know.	Ibyo aribyo byose ugomba kumenya.
It’s not a good time for any of us.	Ntabwo ari igihe cyiza kuri buri wese muri twe.
Well, just an idea.	Nibyiza, igitekerezo gusa.
John gave a gift to his wife.	John yahaye impano umugore we.
Before eating,	Mbere yo kurya,
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I especially.	Njye cyane cyane.
He was very much in everything.	Yari menshi cyane muri byose.
I don't know, but he was right.	Sinzi uko, ariko yari afite ukuri.
There is a lot of food to think about.	Hariho ibiryo byinshi byo gutekereza.
He will be right.	Azaba afite ukuri.
He was not human.	Ntiyari umuntu.
That doesn't matter.	Ibyo nta kibazo.
One really has to listen.	Nukuri umuntu agomba kumva.
Everything is not good.	Byose ntabwo ari byiza.
We can't talk about that.	Ntidushobora kuvuga kuri ibyo.
I think it's good.	Njye mbona ari byiza.
It was not on schedule.	Ntabwo byari muri gahunda.
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
It was a very bad time.	Wari umwanya mubi cyane.
At that point he took over.	Icyo gihe yafashe.
It was not far.	Ntiyari kure.
Here you can find everything.	Hano urashobora kubona byose.
Please help.	Nyamuneka ushobora gufasha.
It was not a plan.	Ntabwo yari gahunda.
I have nothing to do with this.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora kuri ibi.
He told me a lot about him.	Yambwiye byinshi kuri we.
You never know what you're going to get.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo ugiye kubona.
He was no longer in his room.	Ntiyari akiri mu cyumba cye.
Probably a good player.	Birashoboka ko ari umukinnyi mwiza.
He was upstairs.	Yari hejuru.
High position.	Umwanya wo hejuru.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga neza.
Well done.	Neza neza.
You are very smart.	Ufite ubwenge cyane.
And the movie is close.	Kandi firime ni hafi.
that was close.	ibyo byari hafi.
She was beautiful and beautiful.	Yari mwiza kandi mwiza.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
And no one.	Kandi nta n'umwe.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
You were close.	Wari hafi.
One day is good.	Umunsi umwe ni mwiza.
One has to do it.	Umuntu agomba kubikora.
I wanted more children.	Nashakaga abana benshi.
Nothing to look at.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kureba.
She is obviously a beautiful girl.	Biragaragara ko ari umukobwa mwiza.
He needed something to live on.	Yari akeneye ikintu cyo kubaho.
I know you know how to be good.	Nzi ko uzi kuba mwiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
If anyone can do it, he can.	Niba hari ushobora kubikora, arashobora.
I hope you can drive.	Ndizera ko ushobora gutwara.
I was here to study, I didn't want friends.	Nari hano kwiga, ntabwo nashakaga inshuti.
He did it tonight.	Yabikoze muri iri joro.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
It's my phone.	Ni terefone yanjye.
He has a gift.	Afite impano.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I hope there is more to do.	Nizera ko hari byinshi byo gukora.
I can't do it now.	Sinshobora gukora ubu.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko byari byiza.
Inside the room.	Imbere mu cyumba.
You can't stay.	Ntushobora kuguma.
Now this house.	Ubu iyi nzu.
You have to do that.	Ugomba gukora ibyo.
Apparently it happened.	Biragaragara ko byagenze.
In fact, it's very good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza cyane.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
One thing, it is.	Ikintu kimwe, ni.
He seemed to be good at it.	Yasaga naho ari byiza kuri byo.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
But you don’t have to.	Ariko ntugomba.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
Does anyone know how to play? 	Hari umuntu uzi gukina?
Well, good, this was good.	Nibyiza, byiza, ibi byari byiza.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo bigoye.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
It would be a matter of doing what it is.	Byaba ari ikibazo cyo gukora icyo aricyo.
He thought he should go now.	Yatekereje ko agomba kugenda ubu.
Yes, he would be there.	Nibyo, yari kuba ahari.
I knew this was a worry.	Nari nzi ko ibi ari impungenge.
He was to be in the meeting.	Yagombaga kuba mu nama.
He has something behind him.	Afite ikintu inyuma ye.
As if he knew something.	Nkuko yari azi ikintu.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
Did everything go well?	Byose byagenze neza?
But it is a book we need.	Ariko ni igitabo dukeneye.
He also felt bad.	Yumvise kandi nabi.
You've worked.	Wigeze ukora.
Nice, nice house.	Inzu nziza, nziza.
It was almost my age.	Yari hafi imyaka yanjye.
Away.	Kure.
He thought.	Yatekerezaga.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
Maybe everything.	Ahari byose.
He chose to quit his job.	Yahisemo kureka akazi.
We have a lot to do.	Dufite byinshi byo gukora.
I think that's the problem, right now.	Ntekereza ko aricyo kibazo, ubu.
It is not wise for me.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge kuri njye.
We can never talk about one of those things in front of him.	Ntidushobora na rimwe kuvuga kuri kimwe muri ibyo imbere ye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri ikintu cyose.
It is very good and very good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza cyane.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
He wants it out, and he wants it now.	Arashaka hanze, kandi arashaka ubu.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
He is not here, or for him.	Ntabwo ari hano, cyangwa kuri we.
And people.	Kandi abantu.
I needed him to be there.	Nari nkeneye ko azaba ahari.
I need an interior.	Nkeneye imbere.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
I don't think so.	Ntekereza ko atari byo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You have to try hard.	Ugomba kugerageza cyane.
That’s not really a problem.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikibazo.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
What does he say.	Ni iki avuga.
And he would be right.	Kandi yari kuba afite ukuri.
That's what we need, instead of eating.	Nibyo dukeneye, aho kurya.
I'm glad he's here.	Nishimiye ko ari hano.
She just wanted to help her son.	Yashakaga gusa gufasha umuhungu we.
Apparently he doesn't have much.	Biragaragara ko atari afite byinshi.
But he did not have much luck.	Ariko ntabwo yagize amahirwe menshi.
It's just an idea.	Ni igitekerezo gusa.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Now I know that none of this is true.	Ubu nzi ko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
We are a close family.	Turi umuryango wa hafi.
All in all, man.	Byose, muntu.
But that is all.	Ariko ibyo aribyo byose.
Everything looks the same.	Ibintu byose birasa.
I know he's gone.	Nzi ko yagiye.
It's morning.	Ni mu gitondo.
Especially in the long run.	Cyane cyane mugihe kirekire.
Doing anything.	Gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I can't, really.	Sinshobora, mubyukuri.
It seems easy.	Birasa naho byoroshye.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I can do it one day.	Nshobora gukora umunsi umwe.
Everyone was down.	Abantu bose bari hasi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I didn’t know one person.	Ntabwo nari nzi umuntu umwe.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
'	'
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
We have to get out of this!	Tugomba kuva muri ibi!
His friend had to do it.	Inshuti ye yagombaga kubikora.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
I need to go back to work.	Nkeneye gusubira ku kazi.
Any problem is true.	Ikibazo cyose nukuri.
What you need today.	Ukeneye ibyo uyu munsi.
A lot of things, it’s good.	Ibintu byinshi, nibyiza.
If so, you can stop reading now.	Niba aribyo, urashobora guhagarika gusoma nonaha.
I guess not.	Ndakeka ko atari byo.
It came easily.	Yaje byoroshye.
It wasn't a lot of money.	Ntabwo yari amafaranga menshi.
I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not.	Sinzi neza niba icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza cyangwa atari cyo.
I really feel we have that moment.	Ndumva rwose dufite icyo gihe.
I want to read a book.	Ndashaka gusoma igitabo.
It will be very close.	Bizaba hafi cyane.
We are here.	Turi hano.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
You didn't say much today.	Ntabwo wavuze byinshi uyu munsi.
I didn’t want to be in a movie.	Sinifuzaga ko muri firime.
I know what a problem it is!	Nzi ikibazo icyo ari cyo!
You can't be everything to everyone.	Ntushobora kuba byose kuri bose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I thought about it.	Natekereje kuri iki kibazo.
Most people, however, are not really lucky.	Abantu benshi, ariko, ntabwo bafite amahirwe rwose.
He has been making money for years.	Yamaze imyaka akora amafaranga.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose mubyukuri.
None of us know what to do.	Nta n'umwe muri twe uzi icyo gukora.
He just loved people.	Yakundaga abantu gusa.
I saw this.	Nabonye ibi.
From your phone.	Kuva kuri terefone yawe.
Smart people.	Abantu bafite ubwenge.
I have to go back to work.	Ngomba gusubira ku kazi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
You can't trust people.	Ntushobora kwizera abantu.
So much so, that it is possible.	Byinshi cyane, birashoboka.
I'm going to work.	Ngiye ku kazi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I hope he knows what he's doing.	Nizere ko azi ibyo akora.
Ninde.	Ninde.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
We can't stay here.	Ntidushobora kuguma hano.
He chose to leave.	Yahisemo kugenda.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
He had something to say.	Hari icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
You are beautiful too.	Nawe uri mwiza.
Walking is good.	Kugenda ni byiza.
I'm not going to do that with you.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora nawe.
One does not think it is possible but it was.	Umuntu ntatekereza ko bishoboka ariko yari.
Who do you have friends with?	Ufite inshuti ninde.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yagize ubwoba.
That's right.	Nibyo.
If anyone can tell me, it would be nice.	Niba hari ushobora kumbwira, byaba byiza.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
He seemed worried.	Yasaga naho yumva afite impungenge.
Sometimes it is true.	Rimwe na rimwe ni ukuri.
I don't want to see anyone.	Sinshaka kubona umuntu.
He was very alone.	Yari wenyine cyane.
You are probably the best.	Birashoboka ko uri mwiza wenyine.
That's what he told me.	Nibyo yambwiye.
He wasn’t a bad guy, really.	Ntabwo yari umusore mubi, mubyukuri.
I know we can do that.	Nzi ko dushobora kubikora.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
She is terrified.	Afite ubwoba bwo hejuru.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, byoroshye inyuma.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
This was him.	Uyu yari we.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko yabikoze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You have enough time.	Ufite igihe kirekire bihagije.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
At least.	Kuri gato.
Looks like, what they have.	Birasa cyane, ibyo bafite.
He is.	Niwe.
And he is the only one.	Kandi ni we wenyine.
That sounds good enough.	Ibyo birasa neza bihagije.
He was here.	Yari hano.
I don’t believe he even wanted to do this.	Ntabwo nizera ko yashakaga no gukora ibi.
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
It is not his fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
We are not afraid.	Ntabwo dufite ubwoba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You need money.	Ukeneye amafaranga.
My daughter is a very beautiful girl.	Umukobwa wanjye ni umukobwa mwiza cyane.
I knew exactly where everyone was.	Nari nzi neza aho abantu bose bari.
I was not here.	Sinari hano.
Better yet, more than ever in a short time.	Nibyiza, kurenza buri gihe mugihe gito.
As a former woman.	Nkuko yahoze ari umugore.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
Most people are not lucky.	Abantu benshi ntabwo bafite amahirwe.
There are so many great plans here.	Hano hari gahunda nyinshi nziza.
They both had.	Bombi bari bafite.
He was very young.	Yari akiri muto cyane.
Apparently he was scared too.	Biragaragara ko na we yari afite ubwoba.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
But there is something.	Ariko hari ikintu.
Money is not a thing.	Amafaranga ntabwo ari ikintu.
It was on schedule.	Byari muri gahunda.
But none of this is true.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
I saw this.	Nabonye ibi.
He did not go far.	Ntabwo yagiye kure.
But we have to take the time.	Ariko tugomba gufata umwanya.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
This is a good family.	Uyu ni umuryango mwiza.
I want to hear what it is, not what it is.	Ndashaka kumva icyo aricyo, ntabwo aricyo.
Just let it go.	Reka gusa.
He meant what he had said before.	Yashakaga kuvuga ibyo yari yavuze mbere.
I don’t think we can ask for more.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko dushobora gusaba byinshi.
But there is so much to do.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo gukora.
We have to do this.	Tugomba gukora ibi.
I think a lot of people were.	Ntekereza ko abantu benshi bari.
We don't need that.	Ntabwo dukeneye ibyo.
Is this possible?	Ibi birashoboka?
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Man, that's fine.	Umuntu, nibyiza.
Space is everything you have.	Umwanya nibyo ufite byose.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
There are many problems.	Hariho ibibazo byinshi.
Maybe that would be nice.	Ahari ibyo byaba byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It's a movie, but it's true.	Ni firime, ariko ni ukuri.
Lots of opportunities for everyone.	Amahirwe menshi kuri buri wese.
But he doesn't understand.	Ariko ntabwo yumva.
I may be there.	Nshobora kuba ahari.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, nibyo.
She is worried.	Afite impungenge.
He only knew how to win.	Gusa yari azi gutsinda.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
He thought for a moment about what he should do.	Yatekereje gato kubyo agomba gukora.
There is someone to watch.	Hariho umuntu ukwiye kureba.
It was almost a little girl.	Byari hafi umukobwa muto.
I have a lot to learn to do.	Mfite byinshi byo kwiga gukora.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
It was not a plan.	Ntabwo yari gahunda.
There is a woman here.	Hano hari umugore.
They now have the money.	Ubu bafite amafaranga.
He is alone.	We wenyine.
But you know what happened.	Ariko uzi uko byagenze.
We have to take prison clothes.	Tugomba gufata imyenda ya gereza.
You have to read.	Ugomba gusoma.
Not even going to eat.	Ntabwo ari no kujya kurya.
The inside is high.	Imbere ni hejuru.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
He is ashamed of me.	Afite isoni kuri njye.
Go back.	Gusubira inyuma.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
He is doing well on his own.	Arimo akora neza wenyine.
I feel like anyone.	Numva umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Obviously we have to work now.	Biragaragara ko tugomba gukora ubu.
He has nothing to desire.	Nta kintu na kimwe yifuza cyane.
And he would do the same.	Kandi na we yari kubikora.
She knows the girl is right.	Azi ko umukobwa avuga ukuri.
I never really.	Sinigeze mubyukuri.
I can't do enough.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora bihagije.
All they have is money.	Ibyo bafite byose ni amafaranga.
But she got to see her son before he left.	Ariko yaje kubona umuhungu we mbere yuko agenda.
Anyway he was close to me.	Ibyo ari byo byose yari hafi yanjye.
We are together.	Turi hamwe.
I have to stay here.	Ngomba kuguma hano.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
But obviously not today.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari iki gihe.
I was on one recently.	Nari kuri umwe vuba aha.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
You saw.	Wabonye.
Things were going very fast.	Ibintu byari kugenda vuba cyane.
He was not happy about that.	Ntabwo yari yishimiye ibyo.
I think that's what you want.	Ntekereza ko aricyo ushaka.
But that's not the problem.	Ariko ntabwo ari ibibazo.
He said the wrong reason.	Yavuze impamvu atari yo.
I like to win.	Nkunda gutsinda.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
You can make a lot of money.	Urashobora kubona amafaranga menshi.
Especially if you are a woman.	Cyane cyane niba uri umugore.
And for him.	Kandi kuri we.
One to go.	Kimwe cyo kugenda.
I don’t know what he thinks, what he knows and doesn’t know.	Sinzi icyo atekereza, icyo azi kandi atazi.
It was here, very close.	Byari hano, hafi cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
You may know why.	Ushobora kuba uzi impamvu.
I knew what he meant.	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I just thought you should know.	Gusa natekereje ko ugomba kumenya.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
Eventually, he got what he wanted.	Amaherezo, yabonye icyo yashakaga.
There is so much to learn and see.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga no kubona.
Where was he supposed to be?	Yagombaga kuba he.
I thought he was a really good guy.	Natekereje ko ari umusore mwiza rwose.
He told everyone what had happened.	Yabwiye abantu bose uko byagenze.
I can live well.	Nshobora kubaho neza.
It's good to be here with her.	Nibyiza kuba hano hamwe na we.
I knew.	Nari nzi.
It was not a good thing.	Ntabwo byari ibintu byiza.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
Or maybe downstairs.	Cyangwa ahari hasi.
Well, enough for me.	Nibyiza, bihagije kuri njye.
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
That's right.	Ni byo.
I want to hear more about that.	Ndashaka kumva byinshi kuri ibyo.
My house, my family.	Inzu yanjye, umuryango wanjye.
What do you like to eat?	Niki ukunda kurya?
And that's a good thing.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
I like to make movies.	Nkunda gukora firime.
I don't even want to be you.	Sinshaka no kuba wowe.
For me.	Kuri njye.
But he was not here.	Ariko ntabwo yari hano.
It was easy to make mistakes, and.	Byari byoroshye gukora amakosa, kandi.
They are friends.	Ni inshuti.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I don't know what to do.	Ntazi icyo akora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That’s not something everyone should want.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu umuntu wese agomba gushaka.
This is not really the case.	Ibi mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
I like to help people.	Nkunda gufasha abantu.
And another time.	Kandi ikindi gihe.
That is.	Icyo aricyo.
He could say nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga kuvuga.
Apparently he had problems.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ibibazo.
What about a person?	Niki n'umuntu?
Good luck to him.	Amahirwe kuri we.
But that is not the case at all.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo rwose.
When he was us.	Igihe yari twe.
Once upon a time	Wigeze .
He is a good dog.	Ni imbwa nziza.
And, I don’t have to.	Kandi, ntagomba.
Can't work under thirty.	Ntashobora gukora munsi ya mirongo itatu.
I have to go home soon.	Ngomba gutaha vuba.
And it was easy to do something right.	Kandi byari byoroshye gukora ikintu neza.
That's a good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Maybe they were out.	Birashoboka ko bari hanze.
He needed something else to think about.	Yari akeneye ikindi kintu cyo gutekereza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Quit.	Kureka.
I know he will be there, sitting outside.	Nzi ko azaba ahari, yicaye hanze.
Nothing here for me right now.	Nta kintu na kimwe hano kuri njye ubu.
He knew that.	Ibyo yari azi.
It is my family.	Ni umuryango wanjye.
This was very easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye cyane.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
She wanted to see a girl by herself.	Yashakaga kubona umukobwa wenyine.
There are so many here.	Hano hari benshi cyane.
He says he is looking for a job.	Avuga ko arimo gushaka akazi.
I want to know how he works.	Ndashaka kumenya uko akora.
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
He hears what he hears.	Yumva ibyo yumva.
As long as he was close to her.	Igihe cyose yari hafi ye.
In many cases this is true.	Muri byinshi ibi ni ukuri.
You can never speak.	Ntabwo ushobora kuvuga na rimwe.
Maybe.	Yaba ahari.
I ask a lot of questions.	Ndabaza ibibazo byinshi.
All we have is problems.	Ibyo dufite byose ni ibibazo.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
We can't do anything else.	Ntidushobora gukora ikindi.
I can drive later.	Nshobora gutwara nyuma.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
My son says nothing.	Umuhungu wanjye ntacyo avuga.
You're not really the one to tell the woman.	Ntabwo rwose uri uwo kubwira umugore.
It will all happen.	Byose bizaba.
But now we have another problem.	Ariko ubu dufite ikindi kibazo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
There is something you must know.	Hariho ikintu ugomba kuba uzi.
He didn't know when he was here.	Ntabwo yari azi igihe yari amaze hano.
It's almost there.	Hafi gato.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He had a lot to do.	Yari afite byinshi byo gukora.
He hadn't thought about it for years.	Ntabwo yari amaze imyaka atekereza kuri kimwe muri ibyo.
You have to stay with me.	Ugomba kuguma hamwe nanjye.
You want to stay there.	Urashaka kuguma aho.
He didn’t know if he even knew how to work.	Ntabwo yari azi niba yari azi no gukora.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He saw something else.	Yabonye ikindi kintu.
And that was it.	Kandi ibyo byari uko.
He thought hard.	Yatekerezaga cyane.
I can do anything.	Nshobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
He loved a little girl.	Yakundaga umukobwa muto.
You can tell me later.	Urashobora kumbwira nyuma.
I want something else.	Ndashaka ikindi kintu.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
But well, maybe that's not the case.	Ariko nibyiza, birashoboka ko iki atari ikibazo.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
I thought a lot about this.	Natekereje cyane kuri ibi.
I really have no idea.	Ntabwo rwose mfite igitekerezo.
But that was short-lived.	Ariko ibyo byari igihe gito.
For us.	Kuri twe.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
Now he is not gone.	Ubu ntabwo yagiye.
But nothing about him.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe kuri we.
I only have the first thing.	Mfite ikintu cya mbere gusa.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
Either way I can’t win.	Ibyo ari byo byose ntashobora gutsinda.
He saw people.	Yabonye abantu.
She loves to read.	Akunda gusoma.
He said it was great.	Yavuze ko byari byiza cyane.
She was as beautiful as ever.	Yari mwiza nka mbere.
I was a young child.	Nari umwana muto.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
You have to act fast.	Ugomba gukora vuba.
However, this has not always been the case.	Ariko, ntabwo buri gihe byari ibintu byiza.
He did it wrong.	Yabikoze nabi.
He would not be here if possible.	Ntabwo yari kuba hano iyo bishoboka.
It is a family.	Ni umuryango.
If he has.	Niba afite.
He seemed to be thinking a lot.	Yasaga naho atekereza cyane.
Only once a week.	Rimwe mu cyumweru gusa.
It's one day.	Ni umunsi umwe.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo aricyo.
Feeling inside her.	Kumva ari imbere muri we.
It’s great to do it alone today.	Nibyiza cyane gukora wenyine uyumunsi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You have	Ufite.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
You can see everything.	Urashobora kubona byose.
He had a lot of people.	Yari afite abantu benshi.
They are not very friendly.	Ntabwo ari inshuti cyane.
One has the truth.	Umuntu afite ukuri.
We must speak, hear, and see.	Tugomba kuvuga, no kumva, no kureba.
You are.	Urimo.
'	'
He probably looked scared.	Birashoboka ko yasaga naho afite ubwoba.
Do you have any questions?	Ufite ibibazo?
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I am looking for a job.	Ndashaka akazi.
You have to go back.	Ugomba gusubira inyuma.
All together	Byose hamwe.
For me, eating out is a big deal.	Kuri njye, kurya hanze ni ikintu kinini.
Much like his father.	Byinshi nka se.
She is very nice to him.	Ari mwiza cyane kuri we.
I didn't have to go.	Sinari nkwiye kugenda.
When?	Ryari ryari?
I wanted to see it again.	Nashakaga kongera kubona.
He is not his father.	Ntabwo ari se.
You are not old.	Ntabwo ufite imyaka.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
She is dressed.	Yambaye imyenda.
You don't have to work now.	Ntugomba gukora ubu.
If it were normal.	Niba byari bisanzwe.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Think of doing things.	Bwira gukora ibintu.
Could he have done more?	Yashoboraga gukora byinshi?
This is a bigger thing than any of us.	Iki kintu kinini kuruta buri wese muri twe.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I didn’t think it was a good idea.	Sinatekerezaga ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
They are just people.	Ni abantu gusa.
We are too.	Natwe turi.
All of this is true.	Ibyo byose ni ukuri.
Outside is not easy.	Hanze ntabwo byoroshye.
Just knowing the truth.	Kumenya gusa ukuri.
And in fact it was not true.	Kandi mubyukuri ntabwo byari ukuri.
He had to win.	Yagombaga gutsinda.
I understand.	Ndumva.
It's not easy to say.	Ntabwo byoroshye kuvuga.
Here, that's fine.	Hano, nibyiza.
He got the chance.	Yabonye amahirwe.
That's right.	Nibyo.
In fact, it's just fine.	Mubyukuri, ni byiza gusa.
He wanted to know what he wanted to know.	Yashakaga kumenya icyo yashakaga kumenya.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
We had that time.	Twari dufite icyo gihe.
Where is 'he'.	Aho ni 'he'.
You are not really that good.	Ntabwo rwose uri mwiza cyane.
He knew a lot about her.	Yari azi byinshi kuri we.
Too much walking.	Kugenda cyane.
And that would have been nice.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka ko byari byiza.
But that was just me.	Ariko uwo yari njye gusa.
And he's a bad guy.	Kandi ni umusore mubi.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He thought about going back to work.	Yatekereje gusubira ku kazi.
I feel it all the time.	Ndumva buri gihe.
I never found a way.	Sinigeze mbona uburyo.
I know you know things.	Nzi ko uzi ibintu.
But not me either.	Ariko ntabwo ari njye na we.
Everyone is so beautiful.	Umuntu wese ni mwiza cyane.
I think it would be great.	Ndatekereza ko byari kuba byiza.
It is very likely that he is his wife.	Birashoboka cyane ko ari umugore we.
Now he is scared.	Ubu afite ubwoba.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I was going too.	Nanjye nari ngiye.
After.	Nyuma ya.
He told me he did.	Yambwiye ko yabikoze.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
I have no problem.	Nta kibazo mfite.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ni gahunda.
He started inside.	Yatangiye imbere.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza.
He has problems.	Afite ibibazo.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
Who wants to drive?	Ninde ushaka gutwara?
It was a great day out.	Byari byiza cyane umunsi wo gusubira imbere.
I'm afraid to do something.	Mfite ubwoba bwo gukora ikintu.
And that.	Kandi ibyo.
He was not very good.	Ntabwo yari mwiza rwose.
I have a son.	Mfite umuhungu.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekereje.
Great to hear.	Nibyiza cyane kumva.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
You can see it eventually.	Urashobora kubona amaherezo.
That was him.	Uwo yari we.
I never wanted to stay out.	Sinigeze nshaka kuguma hanze.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I had many at once.	Nari mfite benshi rimwe.
I enjoyed the book.	Nishimiye igitabo.
And that is true.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He was now sitting.	Ubu yari yicaye.
There is nothing there.	Aho nta kintu.
We have nothing.	Nta na kimwe dufite.
But then he had to.	Ariko icyo gihe yagombaga.
He wanted something else.	Yashakaga ikindi kintu.
I can't believe it's here.	Sinshobora kwizera ko ari hano.
Learn more about him.	Kumenya byinshi kuri we.
'	'
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
Nowadays it seems like it’s not good.	Muri iki gihe yasaga nkaho atari mwiza.
They know better.	Bazi neza.
Have a great day.	Umunsi mwiza rwose.
It's not us, it's not me.	Ntabwo ari twe, si njye.
He did not want to do this.	Ntiyashakaga gukora ibi.
In and out.	Muri no hanze.
I have a dog that is my baby.	Mfite imbwa ari umwana wanjye.
He wanted to be alone.	Yashakaga kuba wenyine.
Always	Buri gihe.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Nzi neza ko atari byo.
I did everything.	Nakoze ibintu byose.
And good thing.	Kandi ikintu cyiza.
I don't want to be that person.	Sinshaka kuba uwo muntu.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
The party was in the morning.	Ibirori byari mu gitondo.
You have to think first.	Ugomba gutekereza mbere.
I was the only one.	Nari njye gusa.
Being alone in everything.	Kuba wenyine muri byose.
Sometimes, you just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Rimwe na rimwe, ugomba gufata umwanya.
He really wanted to.	Mubyukuri yashakaga cyane.
Not one.	Ntabwo ari umwe.
You know what it is.	Uzi icyo aricyo.
John, it's great to be with you.	John, byiza cyane kubana nawe.
I don't know about that.	Ntacyo nzi kuri ibyo.
I know you can.	Nzi ko ushobora.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I can't talk to you.	Sinshobora kuvugana nawe.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe nuko ari we.
He had no idea what he was going to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo agiye gukora.
Work is a friend.	Akazi ni inshuti.
He did not agree.	Ntiyari yemeye.
I think he is right.	Ndakeka ko afite ukuri.
He went to her.	Yagiye kuri we.
Or maybe later.	Cyangwa birashoboka nyuma.
The son becomes the father, and the father the son.	Umuhungu aba se, na se umuhungu.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo bizaba byiza.
These are people.	Aba ni abantu.
I don't want easy friends.	Ntabwo nshaka inshuti byoroshye.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Walking was very difficult.	Kugenda byari bigoye cyane.
And he had nothing good to do.	Kandi nta kintu cyiza yari afite cyo gukora.
No problem at all.	Nta kibazo rwose.
And it is.	Kandi ni.
He didn’t have to go now.	Ntabwo yagombaga kugenda ubu.
And anyone can do it.	Kandi umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
This is great!	Ubu ni byiza cyane!.
Very nice person	Umuntu mwiza cyane.
I'm really sorry, though.	Mbabajwe rwose, ariko.
He loved dogs.	Yakundaga imbwa.
There are times when.	Hariho rimwe na rimwe.
She was very nice to him.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri we.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
All of that was great.	Ibyo byose byari byiza cyane.
It is not his fault at all.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye rwose.
People needed to see.	Abantu yari akeneye kubona.
Well, so far.	Nibyiza, kugeza ubu.
But, that was it.	Ariko, byari byo.
I really deserve it.	Nkwiye rwose.
It was not normal for me.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe kuri njye.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
He is alone.	Ari wenyine.
He did not know what to expect.	Ntiyari azi icyo yiteze.
And that is me.	Kandi uwo ni njye.
He knew both.	Yari azi bombi.
I am a girl.	Ndi umukobwa.
I can't say the time.	Sinshobora kuvuga igihe.
I'm not.	Ntabwo ndimo.
He is now alone.	Ubu aba wenyine.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I'm not sure that's possible.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko ibyo bishoboka.
However, we are in every shopping week here.	Ariko, turi muri buri cyumweru cyo kugura hano.
You can watch it here.	Urashobora kureba hano.
Maybe it's a lot, or maybe not a lot.	Birashoboka ko ari byinshi, cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byinshi.
I'm sure you have a lot of problems.	Nzi neza ko ufite ibibazo byinshi.
We were not.	Ntabwo twari.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
He didn't know everything about her.	Ntabwo yari azi ibintu byose kuri we.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
But I have the same problem.	Ariko mfite ikibazo kimwe.
Easy to buy every day.	Byoroshye kugura buri munsi.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
He looked quickly in the room.	Yarebye vuba mu cyumba.
You can't wait.	Ntushobora gutegereza.
Only the truth.	Gusa ukuri.
Tell me if it's not true.	Mbwira niba atari byo.
In the beginning.	Ni kare.
I can't think.	Sinshobora gutekereza.
He chose not to.	Yahisemo ko atari byo.
He wanted more, he needed more.	Yashakaga byinshi, yari akeneye byinshi.
Just a book.	Igitabo gusa.
.	.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
She was very nice, but she was embarrassed.	Yari mwiza cyane, ariko agira isoni.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I'm sure he didn't.	Nzi neza ko atabikoze.
Not much since then.	Ntabwo ari byinshi kuva icyo gihe.
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
He did not say why.	Ntiyigeze avuga impamvu.
Whatever you need.	Icyo ukeneye cyose.
But he should not have worried.	Ariko ntiyari akwiye kugira impungenge.
He wanted to know, he had to know.	Yashakaga kumenya, yagombaga kumenya.
I had a reason.	Nari mfite impamvu.
Not that you were.	Ntabwo ari uko wari.
The idea you have.	Igitekerezo ufite.
I don't think anyone is bad.	Ntekereza ko nta muntu mubi mubi.
Is this something?	Iki kintu?
What he wants.	Icyo ashaka.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure bigoye.
You have to be a girl.	Ugomba kuba umukobwa.
But he knew in that look that he had failed.	Ariko yari azi ko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
'woman.	'umugore.
It seemed easy.	Yasaga naho byoroshye.
It was not a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
We have a problem understanding how to win.	Dufite ikibazo cyo kumva uburyo bwo gutsinda.
You don't know how to do it.	Ntabwo uzi kubikora.
She has been fine since day one.	Yari mwiza kuva ku munsi wa mbere.
I got a book from there.	Nabonye igitabo kuva aho.
I was looking for a dog to look at.	Nashakaga imbwa yo kureba.
He really had friends, family.	Nukuri yari afite inshuti, umuryango.
He has problems.	Afite ibibazo.
I think we need to know more about that.	Ntekereza ko dukeneye kumenya byinshi kuri ibyo.
But in the end it was there.	Ariko amaherezo yari ahari.
But they had.	Ariko bari bafite.
He would need his time.	Yaba akeneye umwanya we.
I have a lot of things.	Mfite ibintu byinshi.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He didn't have time to think like that.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo gutekereza gutya.
You were the first family.	Wari umuryango wa mbere.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo yari kuba.
He is now close.	Ubu ari hafi.
I hope you like staying here.	Nizere ko ukunda kuguma hano.
One can do it.	Umuntu arashobora kubikora.
Easy to read.	Byoroshye gusoma.
And he learned something else.	Kandi yamenye ikindi kintu.
He tried to do it all.	Yagerageje kubikora byose.
I can buy a new house.	Nshobora kugura inzu nshya.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
But, in the end, he didn't say anything.	Ariko, amaherezo, ntacyo yavuze.
That's right.	Nibyo.
But here we are.	Ariko hano turi.
Easy to find.	Kumenya byoroshye.
Walking into the house.	Kugenda mu nzu.
And it's good that you have to.	Kandi nibyiza ko ugomba.
Or her hair.	Cyangwa umusatsi we.
All or nothing.	Byose cyangwa ntacyo.
But it looks very similar.	Ariko birasa cyane.
Only one thing and that is it.	Ikintu kimwe gusa kandi ni cyo.
Chances were one.	Amahirwe yari umwe.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
I love this beauty.	Nkunda iyi nziza.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
And there is a reason.	Kandi hariho impamvu.
You may be younger.	Birashoboka ko uri muto.
And it was good for me.	Kandi byari byiza kuri njye.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu ibyo aribyo.
He didn't need to.	Ntiyari akeneye.
I like to play like that.	Nkunda gukina gutya.
Everything is the same here.	Hano ibintu byose birasa.
I needed to talk.	Nari nkeneye kuvuga.
And, she had a baby.	Kandi, yari afite umwana.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I think there is fear.	Ntekereza ko hari ubwoba.
But that was not what you were thinking.	Ariko ntabwo byari ibyo utekereza.
It will be good enough in the short term.	Azaba mwiza bihagije mugihe gito.
We can't take this.	Ntidushobora gufata ibi.
You have to hear more.	Ugomba kumva byinshi.
I mean, that.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko.
For him.	Kuri we.
As long as he could see and hear, there was a chance.	Igihe cyose yashoboraga kubona no kumva, hari amahirwe.
You can never be one.	Ntushobora na rimwe kuba umwe.
But he had watched.	Ariko yari yarebye.
I have one.	Mfite umwe.
But I can't figure it out.	Ariko ntashobora kumenya neza.
It wouldn't be him.	Ntabwo yari kuba we.
Maybe for him.	Ahari kuri we.
We are all family, in fact.	Twese umuryango, mubyukuri.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
That would do the same.	Ibyo na byo byari gukora.
It looks good on me.	Birasa neza kuri njye.
You were close to me.	Wari hafi yanjye.
There is a lot to say.	Hariho byinshi byo kuvuga.
If not far away.	Niba atari kure.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
I had this problem.	Nari mfite iki kibazo.
To say the same.	Kuvuga kimwe.
More than that, in fact.	Kurenza kuri we, mubyukuri.
But there is nothing to say.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
He did.	Yabikoze.
He is doing what he has to do.	Arimo akora ibyo agomba gukora.
But he had something to do.	Ariko yari afite ibyo agomba gukora.
This is not good for me.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
Tell me.	Bwira.
More than a day.	Kurenza no munsi.
I can't go.	Sinshobora kugenda.
He was here.	Yari hano.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza rwose.
Any idea, please.	Igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose, nyamuneka.
There are many cars.	Hariho imodoka nyinshi.
And it will be.	Kandi bizaba.
And we are lucky.	Kandi dufite amahirwe.
That he thought the film was a bad idea.	Ko yatekerezaga ko firime ari igitekerezo kibi.
Living with us.	Kubana natwe.
It was great inside.	Byari byiza cyane imbere.
Too much, too much.	Byinshi cyane, cyane.
That everything was great.	Ko ibintu byose byari byiza cyane.
We have all day.	Dufite umunsi wose.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
Everyone knows someone.	Abantu bose bazi umuntu.
He thought it was not true.	Yatekereje ko rwose atari byo.
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.
I want to stay.	Ndashaka kuguma.
I didn’t really want to know.	Sinifuzaga kumenya mubyukuri.
I don't know what to think.	Sinzi icyo ntekereza.
If you don't want to be friends with me, that's fine.	Niba udashaka kuba inshuti nanjye, nibyiza.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
No one had much to say.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite byinshi byo kuvuga.
What he could do, he had done.	Icyo yashoboraga gukora, yari yakoze.
Not really close.	Ntabwo rwose ari hafi.
We are too.	Natwe turi.
It’s a good thing to do.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
He was never afraid.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ubwoba.
He went.	Yagiye.
And it’s not very good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
Gito.	Gito.
He can do nothing.	Ntacyo ashobora gukora.
But I had the money alone.	Njye ariko yari afite amafaranga wenyine.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I'm seeing someone.	Ndimo mbona umuntu.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
I hope you are.	Ndizera ko uri.
He was three years old at the time.	Icyo gihe yari afite imyaka itatu.
In the morning	Mu gitondo.
I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva.
You can't have it.	Ntushobora kugira.
The last thing he needed was that.	Ikintu cya nyuma yari akeneye ni uko.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
There is only waiting.	Hariho gutegereza gusa.
If not, it is not.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo aribyo.
He is obviously alone.	Biragaragara ko ari wenyine.
The food, however, was really good.	Ibiryo ariko, byari byiza rwose.
I don't know what.	Sinzi icyo.
Most likely they had.	Birashoboka cyane ko bari bafite.
It's good to be back!	Nibyiza gusubira inyuma!.
If anything he needed a plan.	Niba hari aho yari akeneye gahunda.
It finally came.	Amaherezo yaje.
I never wanted to do this.	Sinigeze nshaka gukora ibi.
He has to be here by now.	Agomba kuba hano kugeza ubu.
Sometimes more or sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe byinshi cyangwa rimwe na rimwe.
Trying to do more.	Kugerageza gukora byinshi.
He is one of us.	Ni umwe muri twe.
I knew it then.	Nari nzi icyo gihe.
He loved where he was now.	Yakundaga aho yari ari ubu.
Have faith.	Kugira kwizera.
Only.	Gusa.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
I knew a girl.	Nari nzi umukobwa.
I need more.	Nkeneye byinshi.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He should have known better.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza.
Nothing.	Ntacyo.
Is that right 	Nibyo?
he says.	avuga.
However, there is one small problem.	Ariko, hariho ikibazo kimwe gito.
We.	Ni.
Go ahead.	Kujya imbere.
No one knew where.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho.
I did what you said.	Nakoze ibyo wavuze.
But one should not dwell on that for a long time.	Ariko umuntu ntagomba kuguma kuri ibyo igihe kirekire.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
At the time, I knew what it was.	Icyo gihe nari nzi icyo aricyo.
He went early, as usual.	Yagiye kare, nkuko bisanzwe.
Inside and out.	Imbere no hanze.
As in prison.	Nkuko bari muri gereza.
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
Here and there.	Hano na hano.
You have to have a job.	Ugomba kugira akazi.
I think you are one.	Ntekereza ko uri umwe.
But this is probably the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko ibi aribyo.
He did things on his own.	Yakoze ibintu wenyine.
I should go back.	Nkwiye gusubira inyuma.
We are one today.	Turi umwe muri iki gihe.
It is one thing or another.	Ni ikintu kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
I know exactly what you are up to.	Nzi neza ibyo urimo.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
For this, you can do a lot of things.	Kuri ibi, urashobora gukora ibintu byinshi.
It's up to me.	Ari kuri njye.
But it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo yari mwiza.
Nothing would happen.	Ntacyo byari kuba.
I never thought it would work out.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza gukora neza.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He said who he was.	Yavuze uwo ari we.
That's exactly what you want.	Nukuri icyo ushaka.
I did well.	Nakoze neza.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
One.	Umwe.
His first book.	Igitabo cye cya mbere.
We were just people.	Twari abantu gusa.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
But there is a truth.	Ariko hariho ukuri.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
A woman who knows dogs.	Umugore uzi imbwa.
You can learn a lot from children.	Urashobora kwiga byinshi kubana.
You can't believe he can see it.	Ntushobora kwizera ko ashobora kubona.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He needed a wife.	Yari akeneye umugore.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
That is another problem.	Icyo ni ikindi kibazo.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari azi.
But that would be nice, it would be nice.	Ariko ibyo byaba byiza, byaba byiza.
You are doing a lot of good.	Urimo gukora byinshi byiza.
If you can try it, you should.	Niba ushobora kugerageza, ugomba.
He was scared, but he knew what he was going to see.	Yari afite ubwoba, ariko yari azi ibyo yari kubona.
But it is.	Ariko ni.
Or just me.	Cyangwa ni njye gusa.
He said he had nothing.	Yavuze ko nta cyo yari afite.
That's right.	Nukuri.
And this.	Kandi ibi.
I hear his opinion.	Ndumva igitekerezo cye.
You are not beautiful.	Ntabwo uri mwiza.
Family to many.	Umuryango kuri benshi.
I need to find something.	Nkeneye kubona ikintu.
This is obvious.	Ibi biragaragara.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, bose ni, ariko iyi cyane cyane kuri njye.
But who he is.	Ariko uwo ari we.
I should have known that from the beginning.	Nari nkwiye kumenya ko kuva mbere.
This is very good.	Iyi ni nziza cyane.
She loved her hair.	Yakundaga umusatsi we.
You can't take a drink.	Ntushobora gufata icyo kunywa.
There are problems with everything.	Hariho ibibazo kuri buri kintu.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
You love people.	Ukunda abantu.
Walk on time.	Kugenda mugihe.
It’s not a good party.	Ntabwo ari ibirori neza.
He didn’t want to but he had to.	Ntiyashakaga ariko yagombaga.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
It's not a day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi.
But he probably did.	Ariko birashoboka ko yabikoze.
You don't have to eat until the end!	Ntugomba kurya kugeza nyuma!
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
He knew he was right.	Yari azi ko avuga ukuri.
He always told me.	Yambwiye buri gihe.
Absolutely not!	Rwose sibyo!
I can't win with him.	Sinshobora gutsinda na we.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
For better.	Kuri kuruta.
He has to live.	Agomba kubaho.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
At any time.	Igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I can't walk for a while.	Ntabwo nshobora kugenda igihe gito.
You are that person.	Uri uwo muntu.
Did he mean?	Yashakaga kuvuga?
When we were so close.	Mugihe twari hafi cyane.
He can do whatever he wants.	Arashobora gukora icyo ashaka.
Maybe he should go back to the house.	Ahari agomba gusubira mu nzu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
The food was good.	Ibiryo byari byiza.
Your house is so beautiful.	Inzu yawe ni nziza cyane.
He desperately wants to be there.	Yifuza cyane ko ahari.
Or how.	Cyangwa uburyo.
I don't know, I'm not one.	Sinzi, ntabwo ndi umwe.
All together	Twese hamwe.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
We can't go tonight, or tomorrow.	Ntidushobora kugenda iri joro, cyangwa ejo.
Anyone could beat anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga gutsinda umuntu uwo ari we wese.
And he was ready.	Kandi yari yiteguye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Very easy from top to bottom.	Byoroshye cyane kuva hejuru kugeza hasi.
He chose what he would do.	Yahisemo icyo yari gukora.
He said he did not.	Yavuze ko atabikoze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko hari igihe byari.
You have to.	Ugomba.
Yes, he did know many people.	Nibyo, yari azi abantu benshi.
I didn't know he would be here.	Sinari nzi ko azaba hano.
You know everything you need to know.	Uzi ibyo ukeneye kumenya byose.
We don't have to do anything tonight.	Ntabwo tugomba gukora ikintu na kimwe muri iri joro.
He was not at home.	Ntabwo yari murugo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's really good to be good.	Nibyiza rwose kuba byiza.
I hope someone can help.	Nizere ko umuntu ashobora gufasha.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
I need to talk to you now.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe ubu.
You have to work.	Ugomba gukora.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
To help	Gufasha.
Like this house.	Nka iyi nzu.
He loved a guy.	Yakundaga umusore.
Anyone can see one of them.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese arashobora kubona kimwe muri byo.
I am at home.	Ndi murugo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo rwose.
He never heard of anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze yumva.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
I had a house.	Nari mfite inzu.
In or out.	Muri cyangwa hanze.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I don't want to see anyone.	Sinshaka kubona umuntu.
He was very present.	Yari ahari cyane.
I had thought.	Nari natekereje.
But tomorrow he will be.	Ariko ejo azaba.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
He took the time.	Yafashe umwanya.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka kuruta uko byari bisanzwe.
I know you were just a good friend.	Nzi ko wari inshuti nziza gusa.
It's good to go now.	Nibyiza kugenda ubu.
Each of us.	Buri wese muri twe.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
I did nothing good here.	Nta cyiza nakoze hano.
I want you around.	Ndashaka ko hafi yawe.
I have to do a lot.	Ngomba gukora byinshi.
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
I am in a lot.	Ndi muri byinshi.
I did not know the child.	Sinari nzi umwana.
But this is not the worst case scenario.	Ariko iki ntabwo aricyo kibazo kibi cyane kugira.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
But that’s not really a big deal.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
Especially, however.	Cyane cyane, ariko.
I'm afraid it's easy.	Mfite ubwoba ko byoroshye.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
Any woman would be.	Umugore wese yaba.
What to do.	Icyo ugomba gukora.
Very likely, in fact.	Birashoboka cyane, mubyukuri.
With me	Hamwe na njye.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I know nothing about this.	Ntacyo nzi kuri ibi.
What do you want	Urashaka iki?
She saw the baby.	Yabonye umwana.
I know you're scared.	Nzi ko ufite ubwoba.
I haven't seen that before.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo, mbere.
We have to overcome this.	Tugomba gutsinda iyi.
I don't think he did.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko yabikoze.
They are really worried.	Bafite impungenge rwose.
I need this.	Nkeneye ibi.
He went through everything.	Yagiye muri byose.
And he may just be right.	Kandi arashobora gusa kuba afite ukuri.
The space is full of work.	Umwanya urimo akazi.
She is my wife.	Ni umugore wanjye.
That's a good day.	Ibyo ni umunsi mwiza.
He had heard nothing.	Nta kintu yari yumvise.
There is so much to do.	Hariho ibintu byinshi byo gukora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
One of the hardest.	Kimwe mu bigoye.
Everything is inside.	Ibintu byose ni imbere.
I know exactly what you mean.	Nzi neza icyo ushaka kuvuga.
You really aren't scared.	Mubyukuri ntabwo ufite ubwoba.
It is your family.	Ni umuryango wawe.
It's nothing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu na kimwe.
I am not a child.	Ntabwo ndi umwana.
I saw him drive his car outside.	Nabonye gutwara imodoka ye hanze.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
She is a young girl.	Ni umukobwa muto.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yashoboraga kubaho.
You did that before.	Ibyo wabikoze mbere.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I don't know where he may be.	Sinzi aho ashobora kuba.
His house was gone.	Inzu ye yari yagiye.
Well, maybe school.	Nibyiza, ahari ishuri.
I don't have much money.	Ntabwo mfite amafaranga menshi.
But that's right.	Ariko nibyo.
He will never and never will.	Ntazigera agira kandi ntazigera abikora.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I need a job.	Nkeneye akazi.
This is definitely not the case.	Ibi rwose ntabwo aribyo.
This is great if you have kids at home.	Ibi nibyiza niba ufite abana murugo.
What do you want to tell me?	Urashaka kumbwira iki?
This was difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I think it will be soon.	Ntekereza ko bizaba vuba.
He wanted to live.	Yashakaga kubaho.
He took the money.	Yafashe amafaranga.
We are not.	Ntabwo turi.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Maybe he's here.	Birashoboka ko ari hano.
But he did not know why.	Ariko ntiyari azi impamvu.
He trusted one.	Yari yizeye umwe.
And here.	Kandi hano.
Large and small.	Kinini na gito.
It's not long.	Ntabwo ari igihe kinini.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
This is all.	Ibi ni byose.
But you have to try.	Ariko ugomba kugerageza.
However, the woman in front was a problem.	Ariko, umugore uri imbere yari ikibazo.
He also had it for her.	Yari afite kandi kuri we.
We have one person in that house.	Dufite umuntu umwe muri iyo nzu.
They were not here.	Ntabwo bari hano.
I like work.	Nkunda akazi.
More on that.	Byinshi kuri ibyo.
That would do it.	Ibyo byari kubikora.
What he would get.	Ibyo yari kubona.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
One thing to win.	Ikintu kimwe cyo gutsinda.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
That's what we're here for.	Nibyo turi hano.
And he knows his chances.	Kandi azi amahirwe afite.
Inside, these are the things you want.	Imbere, ibi ni ibintu ushaka.
Here's your guy.	Hano hari umusore wawe.
He knew nothing.	Nta cyo yari azi.
That's not a bad idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi.
I'm not sure if that is possible.	Sinzi neza niba ibyo bishoboka.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's a privilege.	Ni amahirwe.
He did not want her to leave.	Ntiyashakaga ko agenda.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Nzi neza ko atari byo.
I love my gift.	Nkunda impano yanjye.
He seemed happy.	Yasaga naho yishimiye.
I was my child.	Nari umwana wanjye.
I mean no.	Ndashaka kuvuga kuri no.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
You wouldn’t go back to me.	Ntabwo wari gusubira inyuma yanjye.
New car.	Imodoka nshya.
He is going to be a good player.	Agiye kuba umukinnyi mwiza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I'm not sure, really.	Ntabwo nzi neza, mubyukuri.
I thought we were friends.	Natekereje ko turi inshuti.
He didn't really tell me.	Ntacyo yambwiye rwose.
Faith is not easy.	Kwizera ntabwo byoroshye.
I knew it was true.	Nari nzi ko mubyukuri.
There is something to look at here.	Hano hari ikintu cyo kureba hano.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
It was a great movie.	Yari firime nziza cyane.
The boy would not speak.	Umuhungu ntiyari kuvuga.
I needed to live a short time.	Nari nkeneye kubaho igihe gito.
Apparently he was worried.	Biragaragara ko yari afite impungenge.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I like to work.	Nkunda gukora.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I should have known better.	Nari nkwiye kumenya neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
Do you think you can eat that?	Uratekereza ko ushobora kurya gutya?.
I saw that.	Nabonye ibyo.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
It was difficult to find a job.	Byari bigoye gushaka akazi.
But he did not say.	Ariko ntiyigeze avuga.
He wanted to hear from everyone.	Yashakaga kumva buri wese.
I think it's the same.	Mbona ko ari kimwe.
I know everything.	Nzi byose.
But it is.	Ariko ni.
I have now.	Ubu mfite.
With him	Hamwe na we.
There is one thing though.	Hariho ikintu kimwe ariko.
He was a really good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza rwose.
We have to stop trying to stop the truth.	Tugomba guhagarika kugerageza guhagarika ukuri.
'	'
Hair is.	Umusatsi ni.
It's really nice to drive here.	Nibyiza rwose gutwara hano.
But he had a reason.	Ariko yari afite impamvu.
However, he did not.	Ariko, ntabwo yakoze.
But he is.	Ariko ni we.
He took the time to do so.	Yafashe umwanya wo kubikora.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
I have nothing to say so far.	Ntacyo nshobora kuvuga kugeza ubu.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
Or maybe it's just me.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko ari njye gusa.
Here is the truth.	Hano hari ukuri.
I don’t know why anyone should have any problem.	Sinzi impamvu umuntu agomba kugira ikibazo icyo aricyo cyose.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
She thought I had a daughter.	Yatekereje ko mfite umukobwa.
We have to go now.	Tugomba kugenda ubu.
And that would be it.	Kandi ibi byaba.
This, after all, is a book.	Iyi, nyuma ya byose, ni igitabo.
Sometimes, you can't do that.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntushobora kugira icyo ushaka.
He doesn't hear anything about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yumva kuri ibyo.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga.
Nowadays, it is better to eat well.	Muri iki gihe, ni byiza kurya neza.
What do you think.	Icyo utekereza.
He always has a plan.	Buri gihe ahora afite gahunda.
You are getting younger every day.	Urimo kuba muto buri munsi.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe nuko ibintu byagenze gutya.
He just wanted the guy to leave.	Yashakaga gusa ko umusore agenda.
The problem of positive thinking.	Ikibazo cyo gutekereza neza.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
He had not asked why.	Ntabwo yari yabajije impamvu.
He took first place another week.	Yafashe umwanya wa mbere ikindi cyumweru.
But it would not be easy.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuba byoroshye.
She thought the child.	Yatekereje ko umwana.
And he was well aware.	Kandi yari azi neza.
He is not an expert.	Ntabwo ari umuhanga.
That's not the problem here.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo hano.
Really? 	Mubyukuri?
My new car.	Imodoka yanjye nshya.
The problem is money.	Ikibazo ni amafaranga.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
Nothing to look at.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kureba.
You were young.	Wari muto.
We were really bad.	Twari mubi rwose.
He did not speak during the meal.	Ntiyigeze avuga mu gihe cyo kurya.
In a friend.	Muri inshuti.
However, you may be very young.	Ariko, urashobora kuba muto cyane.
But there is a problem with that.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kuri ibyo.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
Meditation and meditation.	Gutekereza no gutekereza.
Eventually, he did nothing.	Amaherezo, ntacyo yakoze.
Me too.	Nanjye.
We have enough of that.	Dufite ibyo bihagije.
Who doesn't want to win?	Ninde udashaka gutsinda?
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
He wanted to know what it was.	Yashakaga kumenya icyo aricyo.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
And well, it was up to me.	Kandi neza, byari kuri njye.
He doesn't have much.	Ntabwo afite byinshi.
And he knew a lot about it.	Kandi yari azi byinshi kuri byinshi.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I can't even read this.	Sinshobora no gusoma ibi.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
He did that.	Ibyo yabikoze.
It is, and it will be.	Ari, kandi bizaba.
I want you to do what you want.	Ndashaka ko ukora ibyo ushaka.
That's a lot of us.	Ibyo ni benshi muri twe.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
You have to do that.	Ugomba gukora gutya.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
Faith is everything.	Kwizera ni byose.
You can't eat anything.	Ntushobora kurya ikintu na kimwe.
I don't know if it's possible.	Sinzi niba bishoboka.
I don't know if that is true.	Sinzi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
He was looking for a job.	Yashakaga akazi.
We need to understand that there is a problem.	Tugomba kumva ko hari ikibazo.
He didn't try.	Ntabwo yagerageje.
You can do the same thing.	Urashobora gukora ikintu kimwe.
It wasn’t as if he knew someone.	Ntabwo byari nkaho ari umuntu uzi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I had the same problem.	Nanjye nagize ikibazo kimwe.
But that is not the case here or here.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
It's great here.	Nibyiza cyane hano.
And indeed.	Kandi rwose.
This is a simple matter.	Ibi ni ibintu byoroshye.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
This is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibi.
I know he is my friend.	Nzi ko ari inshuti yanjye.
I had no plans.	Ntabwo nari mfite gahunda.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
Someone had to.	Umuntu yagombaga.
Below here.	Munsi hano.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kubikora rimwe gusa.
We have a lot to do today.	Dufite ibintu byinshi muri iki gihe.
I can't go.	Sinshobora kugenda.
And he didn't know what he was feeling.	Kandi ntiyari azi icyo yumva.
I wasn’t very good at school.	Ntabwo nari mwiza cyane mwishuri.
I can take the time, right now.	Nshobora gufata igihe, ubu.
I have never heard of a woman.	Sinigeze numva umugore.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I don't.	Ntabwo.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
That is not true today.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri muri iki gihe.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
And he will never do that.	Kandi ntazigera abikora.
He says everything will be fine.	Avuga ko ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
I did that.	Nakoze iyo.
In fact, he did not know what it was.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo.
But in the end.	Ariko amaherezo.
I had.	Nari mfite.
You're going to do it first.	Ugiye kubikora mbere.
Much like him.	Byinshi nka we.
And it was easy.	Kandi byari byoroshye.
Take care.	Gufata neza.
He needs a lot of time.	Akeneye igihe kinini.
I am working hard right now.	Ndimo gukora cyane kuri ubu.
Same here.	Hano kimwe.
That was the plan.	Iyo yari gahunda.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
And we have a gift.	Kandi dufite impano.
My boyfriend.	Umusore wanjye.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
It will not be easy.	Ntabwo bizaba byoroshye.
I was very forward.	Nari imbere cyane.
Obviously, going backwards.	Biragaragara, gusubira inyuma.
Someone made a mistake.	Umuntu yakoze amakosa.
We were there.	Twari aho ndi.
Not too much now.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane ubu.
No good.	Nta mwiza.
Small family.	Umuryango muto.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikibazo kinini.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
There is no one here.	Nta muntu n'umwe hano.
It really is a lot.	Mubyukuri ni byinshi.
That, however, is not the case.	Ibyo ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
You don’t have to be scared.	Ntugomba kugira ubwoba.
But the truth is.	Ariko ukuri.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
Your clothes are beautiful.	Imyenda yawe ni nziza.
Until he is not.	Kugeza igihe atari.
So far, he had a problem.	Kugeza ubu, yari afite ikibazo.
John is a good friend.	John ni inshuti nziza.
Like me	Nkanjye.
Maybe he was expecting something else.	Birashoboka ko yari yiteze ikindi kintu.
Someone here.	Hano hari umuntu.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
It's bad.	Ari mubi.
All, and nothing.	Byose, kandi ntacyo.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
And it's good.	Kandi ni mwiza.
At the time, he was well aware.	Icyo gihe yari azi neza.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta kintu yari yavuze.
I feel very bad.	Ndumva cyane.
But he had done well.	Ariko yari yakoze neza.
He was very skilled.	Yari umuhanga cyane.
There is, in fact, something for everyone.	Hariho, mubyukuri, ikintu kuri buri wese.
In the short term it is good enough.	Mugihe gito ni byiza bihagije.
I don't know what to say.	Ntazi icyo avuga.
It's best to stop playing.	Nibyiza guhagarika gukina.
It should not exist.	Ntagomba kubaho.
This is my friend.	Iyi ni inshuti yanjye.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
He came upstairs.	Yaje hejuru hejuru.
Just like you are not here.	Nkuko nawe atari hano.
It is not his fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
I was nothing to him.	Ntacyo nari kuri we.
Every morning and every night.	Buri gitondo na buri joro.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
I'm not going to talk to you for a long time.	Ntabwo ngiye kuvugana nawe igihe kirekire.
I don't want to talk to you.	Ntashaka kuvugana nanjye.
He didn’t want to get a plan.	Ntiyashakaga kubona gahunda.
Very good, very good.	Nibyiza cyane, byiza cyane.
Either way, we can't go back.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
I'm glad he's gone.	Nishimiye ko yagiye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, bihagije kuri we.
Since then	Kuva icyo gihe.
I did something good.	Nakoze ikintu cyiza.
We have the same idea.	Turi igitekerezo kimwe.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ariko byari byiza.
.	.
Just a phone call.	Terefone gusa.
But that is not always the case.	Ariko ntabwo buri gihe ari ko byagenze.
And that was it, there was no turning back.	Kandi ibyo byari byo, nta gusubira inyuma.
Do you want this too ?.	Urashaka kandi ibi?.
If not.	Niba atari byo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
As before.	Nka mbere.
Did he start this? 	Yatangiye ibi?
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
I can't figure out where, exactly.	Sinshobora kumenya aho, neza.
Or let it be.	Cyangwa reka reka.
It will be a little work.	Bizaba akazi gato.
I am.	Ni njye.
You can, but not me.	Urashobora, ariko ntabwo ari njye.
The child cannot stay here.	Umwana ntashobora kuguma hano.
It was too far.	Byari kure cyane.
He is, in front of me.	Ni we, imbere yanjye.
It is not good to wait.	Ntabwo ari byiza gutegereza.
The little girl said she felt it.	Umukobwa muto yavuze ko yumva.
The last question.	Ikibazo cya nyuma.
He wanted to go fast.	Yashakaga kugenda vuba.
He chose to stay.	Yahisemo kuguma.
We can't find time.	Ntidushobora kubona umwanya.
Getting more.	Kubona byinshi.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe no kuvuga ko ari ukuri.
Really nice house.	Mubyukuri inzu nziza.
It was very bad.	Yari mubi cyane.
I think every day.	Ntekereza buri munsi.
Never thought it was so much to watch.	Ntabwo wigeze utekereza ko ari byinshi byo kureba.
I can't tomorrow.	Sinshobora ejo.
Today, or.	Kuri uyu munsi, cyangwa.
The child was not here.	Umwana ntabwo yari hano.
You have	Ufite.
As it will be good.	Nkuko bizaba byiza.
Only, it wasn’t.	Gusa, ntabwo byari.
He knew nothing.	Nta kintu yari azi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He will not do it.	Ntabwo azabikora.
He thought he might have his place.	Yatekereje ko ashobora kuba afite umwanya we.
This was difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye.
I think I may be feeling something.	Ndatekereza ko nshobora kuba numva ikintu.
This is especially true of children.	Ibi ni ukuri cyane cyane kubana.
I don't like people.	Ntabwo nkunda abantu.
It was his fault, being alone now.	Byari amakosa ye, kuba yari wenyine wenyine ubu.
I think the same bad thing you think.	Ndatekereza ikintu kimwe kibi utekereza.
As long as there is.	Igihe cyose ahari.
Not good for me.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
Everyone who has a job has to work.	Umuntu wese afite akazi agomba gukora.
A lot to say.	Byinshi byo kuvuga.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni cyo kibazo, si byo?
This was your plan.	Iyi yari gahunda yawe.
We are lucky.	Dufite amahirwe.
I know you want to feel bad.	Nzi ko ushaka kumva nabi.
You have to go back.	Ugomba gusubira inyuma.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
He saw one of those.	Yabonye kimwe muri ibyo.
That he really loves it.	Ko akunda rwose.
I never wanted anything else for him.	Sinigeze nshaka ikindi kintu kuri we.
I hope you can too.	Ndizera ko nawe ushobora.
I have to go as far as possible.	Ngomba kujya kure bishoboka.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje kuri icyo kibazo.
His opinion, but not his opinion.	Igitekerezo cye, ariko si igitekerezo cye.
He should have lived.	Yari akwiye kubaho.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
I did something.	Nakoze ku kintu.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
You have less time.	Ufite umwanya muto.
You've done that before.	Ibyo rwose wabikoze mbere.
He did everything right.	Yakoze byose neza.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
Everyone was there.	Abantu bose bari aho.
I don't know this person.	Ntabwo nzi uyu muntu.
At the time, he was right.	Icyo gihe yari afite ukuri.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga.
Everyone was scared.	Abantu bose bari bafite ubwoba.
The dog was a friend.	Imbwa yari inshuti.
But now, he wanted more.	Ariko ubu, yashakaga byinshi.
I just don't know what it is.	Gusa ntazi icyo aricyo.
I feel like I don’t really want to.	Ndumva atari njye ushaka rwose.
He is a good child.	Ni umwana mwiza.
I wondered what had happened.	Natekerezaga uko byagenze.
I want to hear everything.	Ndashaka kumva byose.
You are where you want to be.	Uri aho ushaka kuba.
But she is my wife.	Ariko ni umugore wanjye.
He wanted so much.	Yashakaga cyane.
I don't see a problem.	Ntabwo mbona ikibazo.
But it was a good thing.	Ariko byari ibintu byiza.
In fact, it's just a movie.	Mubyukuri, ni firime gusa.
I was a child at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umwana.
We are not afraid.	Ntabwo dufite ubwoba.
Stop talking! 	Reka kuvuga!
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora.
Really, really smart.	Mubyukuri, ubwenge rwose.
You work hard all the time.	Ukora cyane igihe cyose.
And he likes to go.	Kandi akunda kugenda.
Just once.	Rimwe gusa.
And to me.	Kandi ku.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Well, we have to come here.	Nibyiza, tugomba kuza hano.
And sometimes, that's right.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe, ibyo ni ukuri.
Up	Hejuru
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
It's really just a matter of time.	Nukuri ni ikibazo gusa.
It's too far, too far.	Ni kure cyane, kure cyane.
I just did the job.	Nakoze akazi gusa.
I thought it worked out.	Natekereje ko byagenze neza.
I feel scared.	Numva mfite ubwoba.
Eventually they would leave.	Amaherezo bari kugenda.
I know you want kids.	Nzi ko ushaka abana.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I feel very close.	Ndumva ari hafi cyane.
Things went very well.	Ibintu byagenze neza cyane.
I would eat here.	Nari kurya hano.
He was not lucky.	Ntabwo yari afite amahirwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
At this point, he can be good.	Iki gihe, arashobora kuba mwiza.
It's a good plan.	Ni gahunda nziza.
He could go.	Yashoboraga kugenda.
You can learn a lot from what you do.	Urashobora kwiga byinshi kubyo ukora.
He is leaving.	Arimo kugenda.
He knew he couldn't do it.	Yari azi ko adashobora kubikora.
I'm not sure what he thinks.	Ntazi neza icyo atekereza.
I can see nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora kubona.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
It would be on time.	Yaba ku gihe.
I know you have a job.	Nzi ko ufite akazi.
But he was happy to take the money.	Ariko yishimiye gufata amafaranga.
Most of the time, without looking.	Igihe kinini, nta kureba.
I have to.	Ngomba kugira.
I was, every night.	Nari, buri joro rimwe.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Uzi neza ko ushaka gukora ibi?
You can read it here.	Urashobora gusoma hano.
For decades, it is possible.	Imyaka mirongo, birashoboka.
I was very young.	Nari muto cyane.
I got it right.	Nabonye neza.
Her children.	Abana be.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You don't like it	Ntabwo ukunda.
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
He didn't really like it.	Ntabwo rwose yakundaga.
It was difficult to know how old one was.	Byari bigoye kumenya imyaka umuntu afite.
For, like, One time.	Kuri, nka, Igihe kimwe.
That's really good for me.	Nibyiza rwose kuri njye.
I feel nothing.	Nta kintu numva.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
He can see a lot.	Arashobora kubona byinshi.
After much study, she applied to be a teacher.	Amaze kwiga cyane, yasabye kuba umwarimu.
I think you can do it.	Ntekereza ko ushobora kubikora.
What is he doing?	Arimo akora iki?
Obviously they have.	Biragaragara ko bafite.
Not everyone can apply.	Ntabwo ari umuntu wese ushobora gusaba.
I need you to do something.	Nkeneye ko ukora ikintu.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It seems like everyone.	Birasa nkaho abantu bose.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
He went there.	Yagiye aho.
And you are probably one.	Kandi birashoboka ko uri umwe.
I am here with you.	Ndi hano hamwe nawe.
You have to do this.	Ugomba gukora ibi.
Sometimes things go awry.	Rimwe na rimwe ibintu byagenze nabi.
Apparently he wanted to get out of there.	Biragaragara ko yashakaga kuva aho.
The day.	Umunsi.
But then he went a little further.	Ariko nyuma yaje kugenda gato.
I don't know the problem.	Sinzi ikibazo.
But that is not possible here.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo bishoboka hano.
You were absolutely right.	Wari ufite ukuri rwose.
It’s not that there’s something to be caught.	Ntabwo ari uko hari ikintu cyo gufata.
And in fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Kandi mubyukuri aribyo, nibyiza.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
But there is something better.	Ariko hariho ikintu cyiza kuruta.
I am happy for my son.	Nishimiye umuhungu wanjye.
I just don’t know what to see.	Gusa sinzi icyo mbona.
He did not know exactly why.	Ntabwo yari azi neza impamvu.
He likes to go to the movies.	Akunda kujya muri firime.
Only now have I seen something.	Gusa ubu nabonye ikintu.
You are a smart guy.	Uri umusore uzi ubwenge.
I need to go fast.	Nkeneye kugenda vuba.
Something he would say to himself.	Ikintu yari kuvuga wenyine.
We have to do something else.	Tugomba gukora ikindi kintu.
Having good things.	Kugira ibintu byiza.
He has mistakes.	Afite amakosa.
Maybe he did it, or maybe it was just fear.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze, cyangwa birashoboka ko byari ubwoba gusa.
He went.	Yagiye.
He never did.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora.
He is not happy about this.	Ntabwo ari uko yishimiye ibi.
I had a good idea.	Nari mfite igitekerezo cyiza.
He knows it's not good for her.	Azi ko atari byiza kuri we.
He knew it was all his fault.	Yari azi ko byose ari amakosa ye.
I think we need to talk about this.	Ndakeka ko dukeneye kuvuga kuri ibi.
But you did.	Ariko wabikoze.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I'm not going now.	Ntabwo ngiye ubu.
A lot of people here have cars.	Abantu benshi hano bafite imodoka.
He is here.	Ari hano.
I don't have a house.	Nta nzu yanjye mfite.
You can't go far.	Ntushobora kuva kure.
Much of it actually.	Byinshi mubyukuri.
Car	Imodoka
It started.	Yatangiye.
He really did.	Yabikoze rwose.
This is a great car.	Iyi ni imodoka nziza cyane.
He never felt that he was right.	Ntiyigeze yumva afite ukuri.
Good time	Igihe cyiza.
Women.	Akazi.
Or maybe it's just me.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko ari njye gusa.
Big, while at school he would be young and shy.	Kinini, mu gihe ku ishuri yaba ari muto kandi agira isoni.
And for now, that's fine.	Kandi kuri ubu, nibyiza.
I knew he would do it.	Nari nzi ko azabikora.
Probably not soon.	Birashoboka ko atari vuba.
I'm doing it.	Ndimo kubikora.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I wanted to leave.	Nashakaga kuva aho.
But it was his fault.	Ariko byari amakosa ye.
We don't need much.	Ntabwo dukeneye byinshi.
And he knows nothing now.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe azi ubu.
You can't go back.	Ntushobora gusubira inyuma.
They don't know what to do.	Ntabwo bazi icyo gukora.
I know the right guy.	Nzi umusore ukwiye.
He has his own house.	Afite inzu ye.
That's not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose aribyo.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
He would not be around.	Ntabwo yari kuba hafi.
But for one thing.	Ariko ku kintu kimwe.
But sometimes.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe.
There are things to do.	Hariho ibintu byo gukora.
I really hope he does well.	Ndizera rwose ko akora neza.
You don't need help.	Ntabwo ushaka ubufasha.
But there is one thing.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe.
He just said what he thought.	Yavuze gusa icyo yatekerezaga.
Not at all.	Na gato.
I mean, everything is possible.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko byose bishoboka.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
He asked the boy a question.	Yabajije umuhungu ikibazo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
Sometimes very.	Rimwe na rimwe cyane.
Her hair was scary.	Umusatsi we wari ufite ubwoba.
It is not very high.	Ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi.
He tried that morning.	Yagerageje muri icyo gitondo.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
He loved everything.	Yakundaga byose.
But obviously not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari ukuri.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
See, see, see!	Kubona, kubona, kubona!
On that day.	Kuri uwo munsi.
Maybe we should try.	Ahari tugomba kugerageza.
We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
Things would be better.	Ibintu byaba byiza.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Nta kintu ushobora gukora.
I'm so glad you did.	Nishimiye kubikora cyane.
They know we're here.	Bazi ko turi hano.
I mean never.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko nta na rimwe.
It was just nice to hear.	Byari byiza kumva gusa.
You want to take your time.	Urashaka gufata umwanya wawe.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
I was here.	Nari hano.
We are good friends	Turi inshuti nziza.
I'm taking it.	Ndimo gufata.
No one knew where they were.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho bari.
I made new friends.	Nabonye inshuti nshya.
Eventually the children were at home.	Amaherezo abana bari murugo.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
I enjoy this world.	Nishimiye iyi si.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
A little time.	Umwanya muto.
But he could not do it alone.	Ariko ntabwo yashoboraga kubikora wenyine.
Much of that here.	Byinshi muri ibyo hano.
I did not have the opportunity to find out.	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe yo kumenya ikintu ahari.
I've never done anything so big before.	Sinigeze nkora ikintu kinini cyane mbere.
When she is beautiful, she is beautiful.	Iyo ari mwiza, aba ari mwiza rwose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I never heard him speak.	Sinigeze numva avuga.
I don't know why, exactly.	Sinzi impamvu, neza.
I doubt it would be good.	Ndashidikanya ko byaba byiza.
He always had.	Buri gihe yari afite.
I don't know what to believe.	Sinzi icyo nizera.
But he didn't go.	Ariko ntabwo yagiye.
But he has a problem.	Ariko afite ikibazo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
When there is only one thing, you must not do anything.	Iyo hari ikintu kimwe gusa, ntugomba gukora ikintu na kimwe.
He probably did it once.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze rimwe.
He took his father.	Yafashe se.
I don't know where he is.	Sinzi aho ari.
He is what we need.	Niwe dukeneye.
I am your friend	Ndi inshuti yawe
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
It was not until he was fully aware of what he saw.	Ntabwo kugeza igihe yari azi neza ibyo yabonye.
But he can't go back.	Ariko ntashobora gusubira inyuma.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
Probably not later.	Birashoboka ko atari nyuma.
The party went well.	Ibirori byagenze neza.
We have to go tonight.	Tugomba kugenda iri joro.
The problem was that he had the truth.	Ikibazo nuko yari afite ukuri.
I guess everything is possible.	Ndakeka ko byose bishoboka.
He is ashamed.	Afite isoni.
The clothes didn't look good.	Imyenda ntabwo yasaga neza.
Sometimes it is true sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe ni ukuri rimwe na rimwe.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
The opportunity was sought.	Amahirwe yari yashakaga.
I have to be all of them.	Ngomba kuba bose.
Maybe we had.	Birashoboka ko twari dufite.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
No one had a say.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite icyo avuga.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I knew what it was.	Nari nzi icyo aricyo.
If you can help.	Niba ushobora gufasha.
Going well.	Kugenda neza.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
My whole family.	Umuryango wanjye wose.
So far, he has.	Kugeza ubu, afite.
If you want to try it, fine.	Niba ushaka kugerageza, nibyiza.
One of them.	Umwe muri we.
Not you, obviously.	Ntabwo ari wowe, biragaragara.
I had nothing.	Nta na kimwe nari mfite.
The girl he loved, he was.	Umukobwa yakundaga, yari.
The day is ahead of you.	Umunsi uri imbere yawe.
You were right.	Wari ufite ukuri.
But it was outside.	Ariko byari hanze.
He must be still here.	Agomba kuba akiri hano.
Looks like you want more.	Birasa nkaho ushaka byinshi.
Someone was outside.	Hari umuntu wari hanze.
He came alone.	Yaje wenyine.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
One idea, in fact.	Igitekerezo kimwe, mubyukuri.
You can definitely.	Urashobora rwose.
He was not.	Ntiyari arimo.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
But later.	Ariko nyuma.
He was here.	Yari hano.
I heard.	Numvise.
You may think.	Urashobora gutekereza.
And you have seen great things.	Kandi wabonye ibintu byiza cyane.
That's not the problem.	Icyo ntabwo ari ikibazo.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
You can't eat food.	Ntushobora kurya ibiryo.
He doesn’t want to say what he looks like.	Ntabwo ashaka kuvuga uko asa.
He had not just gone.	Ntiyari yagiye gusa.
Why do they have everyone after me.	Kuki bafite abantu bose nyuma yanjye.
I just don't know how to do it.	Gusa sinzi kubikora.
He can hear what you're going through.	Arashobora kumva icyo ugiye.
As you were.	Nkuko wari.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He didn't seem to know what to do.	Yasaga naho atazi icyo gukora.
And there is not much to say.	Kandi nta byinshi byo kuvuga.
That's really human.	Nibyo rwose ni umuntu.
Maybe he would go.	Ahari yari kugenda.
And a lot of people.	Kandi abantu benshi.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, kandi niba tugomba gukora.
I can't wait for more.	Sinshobora gutegereza byinshi.
He was dressed to go.	Yari yambaye kugenda.
They know full well that they are.	Bazi neza ko bari.
Maybe that was enough.	Birashoboka ko ibyo byari bihagije.
You can't find anyone.	Ntushobora kubona umuntu.
The house is very nice.	Inzu ni nziza cyane.
I feel like there are times.	Ndumva hari igihe.
You have to talk to me.	Ugomba kuvugana nanjye.
You know people.	Uzi abantu.
He has a school.	Afite ishuri.
He did not want his money.	Ntiyashakaga amafaranga ye.
We have no way of knowing.	Ntabwo dufite uburyo bwo kumenya.
It would not be just that.	Ntabwo byari kuba gusa.
He is not sitting well.	Ntabwo yicaye neza.
But so far.	Ariko kugeza ubu.
Not before, and certainly not after.	Ntabwo mbere, kandi rwose ntabwo nyuma.
He knows exactly what he is doing.	Azi neza ibyo akora.
He made the girl look.	Yakoze umukobwa kureba.
Or not alone.	Cyangwa ntabwo ari wenyine.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
One only has to be lucky.	Umuntu agomba kugira amahirwe gusa.
No one said much.	Nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
It's not easy before.	Ntabwo byoroshye mbere.
And you are here.	Kandi uri hano.
As they plan to do.	Nkuko bafite gahunda yo kubikora.
He had not gone.	Ntiyari yagiye.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
You have to go before you tell it.	Ugomba kugenda mbere yuko bwira.
You have good friends here.	Ufite inshuti nziza hano.
Very good player.	Umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
They are all good friends.	Bose ni inshuti nziza.
I wanted more for me than anything else.	Nashakaga ko kuri njye kuruta ikindi kintu cyose.
He said he could not do it on his own.	Yavuze ko adashobora kubikora wenyine.
I had something to eat.	Nari mfite icyo kurya.
Everything he did was true.	Ibyo yakoze byose byari ukuri.
He said he heard something.	Yavuze ko hari icyo yumvise.
Get a plan!	Kubona na gahunda!.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I'm not really going.	Ntabwo ngiye rwose.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
He said you did it.	Yavuze ko ibyo wabikoze.
They have none.	Ntabwo bafite.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
Gone, gone.	Yagiye, yagiye.
We have a lot of good things going on.	Dufite ibintu byinshi byiza.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
Any idea ?.	Igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose ?.
He was not expecting a problem.	Ntiyari yiteze ikibazo.
It's too early in the morning.	Ni kare cyane mu gitondo.
Someone or something.	Umuntu cyangwa ikintu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko iyo ari yo mpamvu.
It’s the same for everyone.	Ni kimwe kuri buri wese.
He was not ready.	Ntiyari yiteguye.
No questions asked.	Nta kibazo yabajije.
I guess it's me.	Ndakeka ko ari njye.
You know how you can.	Uzi uburyo ushobora.
You have to learn to get married.	Ugomba kwiga gushaka.
He can go far.	Arashobora kujya kure.
It would be.	Byaba.
He speaks well.	Avuga neza.
You were so beautiful.	Wari mwiza cyane.
He knows exactly what to do.	Azi neza icyo gukora.
That doesn't matter.	Ibyo ntacyo.
Much to learn.	Byinshi byo kwiga.
It's not you and me.	Ntabwo ari wowe nawe.
He said there were probably too many people.	Yavuze ko ahari ahari abantu benshi cyane.
He thought of going for help.	Yatekereje kujya gushaka ubufasha.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
You can do this easily at home.	Urashobora kubikora byoroshye murugo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He wanted it for a long time.	Yashakaga cyane igihe kirekire.
He was young.	Yari akiri muto.
He is not doing anything wrong.	Ntabwo akora ikintu kibi.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
He didn't know if he could do it.	Ntiyari azi niba ashobora kubikora.
Nearby, now.	Hafi aho, ubu.
That is why.	Iyo ni yo mpamvu.
But we are a little ahead.	Ariko turi imbere gato.
Only he is the same.	Gusa wenyine ni kimwe.
Absolutely.	Ari rwose.
He had not said when he would be here.	Ntabwo yari yavuze igihe azaba ari hano.
He did it all.	Yakoze byose.
He didn't look like he had.	Ntabwo yasaga nkaho afite.
I know what he wants and needs.	Nzi icyo ashaka kandi akeneye.
Something really bad.	Ikintu rwose ni kibi.
He could have been there for a while.	Yashoboraga kuba ahari igihe gito.
He did not want to be his father's man.	Ntiyashakaga kuba umuntu wa se.
He began to return home.	Yatangiye gusubira mu nzu.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
More than that.	Kurenza.
This is not a good thing for us.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu byiza kuri twe.
I think it was.	Njye mbona byari.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It looks good on him.	Birasa neza kuri we.
Eat well, too.	Kurya neza, kandi.
But it worked.	Ariko byagenze neza.
That was very possible.	Ibyo byari bishoboka cyane.
I feel lucky.	Ndumva mfite amahirwe.
I am nothing.	Ntacyo ndi cyo.
He did not have many friends.	Ntiyari afite inshuti nyinshi.
I know how he thinks.	Nzi uko atekereza.
I think that's all.	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo byose.
This is obviously not true.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari ukuri.
But this is your day.	Ariko uyu ni umunsi wawe.
I shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora.
It was true, until it happened.	Byari ukuri, kugeza aho byagenze.
He does nothing.	Ntacyo akora.
Whatever it is, it will be good.	Ibyo aribyo byose, bizaba byiza.
You have to do that.	Ugomba kubikora gutya.
This is not the case here.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo gukina hano.
He has no job.	Nta kazi afite.
Soon, it will be.	Vuba, bizaba.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I did a lot.	Nakoze cyane.
You saw nothing.	Ntacyo wabonye.
And, finally, it was good for him.	Kandi, amaherezo, byari byiza kuri we.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
They don't know the job.	Ntabwo bazi akazi.
I thought he had a lot of luck.	Natekereje ko afite amahirwe menshi.
You were young at the time.	Icyo gihe wari muto.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza rwose.
You can stay home at that time.	Urashobora kuguma murugo icyo gihe.
He looked at this.	Yarebye iyi.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
He could see very far.	Yashoboraga kubona kure cyane.
He is not a good person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mwiza.
I doubt anyone will.	Ndashidikanya ko umuntu wese azabikora.
But he could see nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
He had something to think about.	Yari afite icyo atekereza.
I just love it.	Nkunda gusa.
We had something.	Twari dufite ikintu.
He was thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
Apparently it would have.	Biragaragara ko byari kugira.
You can stay on top, though.	Urashobora kuguma hejuru, naho.
Right now he needed time alone.	Kuri ubu yari akeneye umwanya wenyine.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
It looks good.	Asa neza.
He looked at himself.	Yarebye wenyine.
You can let go of your hair.	Urashobora kureka umusatsi wawe.
He knew what he wanted.	Yari azi icyo ashaka.
You're not going.	Ntabwo ugiye.
I can eat anything.	Nshobora kurya ikintu cyose.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I can't see normal.	Sinshobora kubona bisanzwe.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
For now he would stay.	Kuri ubu yari kuguma.
It's inside of it.	Ni imbere muri yo.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
A guy who likes to play but especially likes to win.	Umusore akunda gukina ariko cyane cyane akunda gutsinda.
It's not easy and it's not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
Sometimes a lot, sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe byinshi, rimwe na rimwe.
He is my age.	Afite imyaka yanjye.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
But even here.	Ariko na hano.
I have it here.	Mfite hano.
It was not for him.	Ntabwo yari kuri we.
It was really up to us.	Rwose byari kuri twe.
I have to learn a lot.	Ngomba kwiga byinshi.
And there is nothing to eat.	Kandi nta kintu cyo kurya.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You did it yourself.	Wabikoze wenyine.
I'm sure I need to.	Nzi neza ko nkeneye.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
And it's all about me.	Kandi byose kuri njye.
And that's just the thing.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu gusa.
If not, it will be.	Niba atari byo, bizaba.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I think so.	Ndatekereza ko.
I wanted it badly.	Nashakaga nabi.
Help for today.	Ubufasha kuri uyumunsi.
I can't find anyone here.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona umuntu hano.
He said he was not.	Yavuze ko atari we.
But not here, and not now.	Ariko ntabwo ari hano, kandi si ubu.
I am so happy to be your wife.	Nishimiye cyane kuba umugore wawe.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
And it's not hard to see why.	Kandi ntabwo bigoye kubona ko aribyo.
He didn't know what to do or where to go.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora cyangwa aho agomba kujya.
I needed an idea and quickly.	Nari nkeneye igitekerezo kandi vuba.
I can go outside.	Nshobora kujya hanze.
But he has.	Ariko afite.
I like where we are.	Nkunda aho turi.
He was ready to go.	Yari yiteguye kugenda.
How can we make good food?	Nigute dushobora gukora ibiryo byiza?
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ikintu cyiza.
We can't live.	Ntidushobora kubaho.
Fear.	Ubwoba.
But he was not there.	Ariko ntiyari ahari.
You did it.	Wabikoze.
Eventually, he would win.	Amaherezo, yari gutsinda.
So far so good.	Nibyiza kugeza ubu.
I don't want to go.	Ntashaka kugenda.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You have nothing now.	Nta na kimwe ufite ubu.
But not until then.	Ariko si kugeza icyo gihe.
I did well.	Nakoze neza.
His last book.	Igitabo cye cya nyuma.
As much as possible.	Nkuko bishoboka.
You want to hear everything.	Urashaka kumva byose.
I felt good.	Numvise neza.
This is a long time ago.	Iki ni igihe kirekire mbere.
A lot of things went wrong.	Ibintu byinshi byagenze nabi.
This time, he wants to talk.	Iki gihe, arashaka kuvuga.
He came to live with us.	Yaje kubana natwe.
He thinks it's a mistake.	Yibwira ko ari amakosa.
More nearby.	Byinshi hafi.
And that was true.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri.
If anyone can do it, he can.	Niba hari ushobora kubikora, arashobora.
One day, he left.	Umunsi umwe, yagiye.
I want to stop hearing so much.	Ndashaka guhagarika kumva cyane.
Best of all.	Nibyiza muri byose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Or maybe, but not tonight.	Cyangwa ahari birashoboka, ariko ntabwo iri joro.
And this is not much.	Kandi ibi ntabwo ari byinshi.
I may not be able to do this.	Sinshobora kuba nshobora gukora ibi.
He knew a lot.	Yari azi byinshi.
To me it is a bad idea.	Kuri njye ni igitekerezo kibi.
But you can't take that.	Ariko ntushobora gufata ibyo.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He felt well prepared.	Yumvise yiteguye neza.
He started his idea.	Yatangiye igitekerezo cye.
He is one.	Ni umwe.
Only you can tell.	Niwowe wenyine ushobora kuvuga.
That would not be enough.	Ntabwo byaba bihagije kuri byose.
I want to do something good.	Ndashaka gukora ikintu cyiza.
He did it this morning.	Yabikoze muri iki gitondo.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo.
I was about to give up.	Nari hafi kureka.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kumva gusa.
These are children.	Aba ni abana.
He did not mean anything else.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga ikindi kintu.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
He was just happy to be there.	Yishimiye gusa kuba ahari.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari azi.
That's a lot.	Nibyo byinshi.
I love everything.	Nkunda ibintu byose.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
At the time, he never heard of his friend.	Icyo gihe ntiyigeze yumva inshuti ye.
We have what we need.	Dufite ibyo dukeneye.
I don't want to see the book again.	Sinshaka kongera kubona igitabo.
He was a very popular player.	Yari umukinnyi ukunda cyane.
You are beautiful	Waba mwiza.
I like to hear what everyone is saying !.	Nkunda kumva icyo buri wese avuga!.
You can be one.	Urashobora kuba umwe.
I know a lot of people.	Nzi abantu benshi.
This is not just a concern.	Ibi ntabwo ari impungenge gusa.
Most of the time not.	Igihe kinini ntabwo.
My friend is here.	Inshuti yanjye hano.
If so, then so be it.	Niba kandi aribyo.
But there is more.	Ariko hari byinshi.
I feel scared.	Ndumva ko ufite ubwoba.
It is not a very good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza cyane.
He should not have been alone.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kugira wenyine.
But please.	Ariko nyamuneka.
Space is a big thing.	Umwanya ni ikintu kinini.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
This is a problem.	Iki ni ikibazo.
It wasn't something he did much.	Ntabwo yari ikintu yakoze cyane.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi sibyo.
He knows exactly why.	Azi neza impamvu.
It would be bad.	Byari kubaho nabi.
They had no idea.	Ntabwo bari bafite igitekerezo.
I have a lot of things you might want.	Mfite ibintu byinshi ushobora kuba ushaka.
Everything.	Byose.
It’s good to see so many people, so many things, in front of him.	Nibyiza kubona abantu benshi, ibintu byinshi, imbere ye.
That was a good thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza.
Kinini.	Kinini.
But the best we can do.	Ariko nibyiza dushobora gukora.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
He is on top.	Ari hejuru.
He got a job.	Yabonye akazi.
He knew everything.	Yari azi byose.
I heard.	Numvise.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I don't understand everyone.	Ntabwo numva abantu bose.
I did not know.	Sinari nzi.
Apparently he was worried.	Biragaragara ko yari afite impungenge.
You can tell.	Urashobora kuvuga.
Quick, very fast.	Vuba, vuba cyane.
But they knew where he was.	Ariko bari bazi aho ari.
We were not.	Ntabwo twari.
That's not good.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
As if he were a very young man.	Nkaho yari umusore muto cyane.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
His father was a good man.	Se yari umuntu mwiza.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
It was true and it was not true.	Byari ukuri kandi ntabwo byari ukuri.
He eventually left the house.	Amaherezo yaje kuva mu nzu.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza.
You have to listen to everything he says.	Ugomba kumva ibyo avuga byose.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Sometimes it's easy.	Rimwe na rimwe byoroshye.
I think he just wanted to.	Ntekereza ko yashakaga gusa.
That's it.	Uwo ni.
There is a dog.	Hariho imbwa.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
I have something to do.	Mfite ibyo gukora.
But he saw nothing.	Ariko nta kintu yabonye.
Leaving this world.	Kureka iyi si.
At that point he took a long time.	Icyo gihe yafashe igihe kirekire.
Where you want	Aho ushaka.
They have time.	Bafite umwanya.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He tried to tell his friend something.	Yagerageje kubwira inshuti ye ikintu.
He finally had what he wanted.	Amaherezo yari afite ibyo yashakaga.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
He wanted to hear more.	Yashakaga kumva byinshi.
Anyone can say what they want.	Umuntu wese arashobora kuvuga icyo ashaka.
That was exactly what happened.	Icyo yari cyo rwose.
And here he came, here he came, here he is.	Kandi hano yaje, hano yaje, hano.
I have it here.	Mfite hano.
No one should drink and drive.	Nta muntu n'umwe ugomba kunywa no gutwara.
Or one can.	Cyangwa umuntu arashobora.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
No good.	Nta cyiza cyiza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
!!!.	!!!.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
You have to do it now.	Ugomba gukora ubu.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
I have that.	Mfite ibyo.
Everything went well before.	Byose byagenze neza mbere.
It's very close.	Ni hafi cyane.
We have to try.	Tugomba kugerageza.
Not just us.	Ntabwo ari twe gusa.
, '.	, '.
Only.	Gusa.
We have to live in it.	Tugomba kubaho muri yo.
You don’t do everything you can do.	Ntabwo ukora ibintu byose ushobora gukora.
One by one.	Umwe umwe.
Neither am I.	Nanjye ntabwo ari njye.
She only knew that she had a son.	Yari azi gusa ko afite umuhungu.
You have to have that.	Ugomba kugira ibyo.
Very good and many.	Byiza cyane kandi byinshi.
At times, she did not know what to do with herself.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntabwo yari azi icyo yumva ashaka gukora cyane.
I knew how to work here.	Nari nzi gukora hano.
One thing, for sure.	Ikintu kimwe, mubyukuri.
Car, maybe.	Imodoka, birashoboka.
You don't have to do anything!	Ntugomba gukora ikintu!
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka ko hano.
He took issues.	Yafashe ibibazo.
Woman.	Umugore.
He could do this, he had to do this.	Yashoboraga gukora ibi, yagombaga gukora ibi.
He is now a friend.	Ubu ni inshuti.
You can learn quickly.	Urashobora kwiga vuba.
He enjoyed being around.	Yishimiye kuba hafi.
I saw a problem.	Nabonye ikibazo.
And they probably had the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko bari bafite ukuri.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
Not enough to say.	Ntabwo bihagije kuvuga.
In any case, he may have seen someone.	Ibyo ari byo byose, birashoboka ko yabonye umuntu.
I just thought it was good.	Gusa natekereje ko ari byiza.
I thought about it all day.	Natekereje kuri ibi umunsi wose.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
He should not be near me.	Ntagomba kuba hafi yanjye.
I had a lot to say.	Nari mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
He said many difficult things.	Yavuze ibintu byinshi bigoye.
You can eat and do anything.	Urashobora kurya ukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
And it is far, far away, easier to say than to do.	Kandi ni kure, kure, byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
Or maybe it's not him.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari we.
She feels scared.	Yumva afite ubwoba.
She wants to help.	Ashaka gufasha.
Maybe he can.	Ahari arashobora.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
If you think you can play, you can play.	Niba utekereza ko ushobora gukina, urashobora gukina.
It's a party.	Ni ibirori.
I was really.	Nari rwose.
I know he is.	Nzi ko ari we.
You can't say what he thinks.	Ntushobora kuvuga icyo atekereza.
He may be about to find out.	Ashobora kuba ari hafi kumenya.
Take time.	Gufata umwanya.
In front of you.	Imbere yawe.
It was not an idea for him.	Ntabwo yari igitekerezo kuri we.
She gave the baby a bath.	Yahaye umwana koga.
I'm not here.	Ntabwo ndi hano.
And back.	Kandi inyuma.
He was ready to do it.	Yari yiteguye kubikora.
There is a dog.	Hariho imbwa.
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
He has an early day.	Afite umunsi kare.
I knew he had come forward.	Nari nzi ko yaje imbere.
I don't want to live.	Sinshaka kubaho.
You are good to us.	Uri mwiza kuri twe.
You need time.	Ukeneye umwanya vuba.
And you are beautiful.	Kandi uri mwiza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
You have to have faith.	Ugomba kugira kwizera.
He did exactly what he was supposed to do.	Yakoze neza ibyo yagombaga gukora.
She is a very active teacher.	Ni umwarimu ukora cyane.
Up and down.	Hejuru no hejuru.
You can stay in the house.	Urashobora kuguma mu nzu.
He had his own problems.	Yari afite ibibazo wenyine.
Very good, easy.	Nibyiza cyane, byoroshye.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
I thought that was what he was going to do.	Natekereje ko aribyo agiye gukora.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
Especially not me.	Cyane cyane ntabwo ari njye.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
I had a plan.	Nari mfite gahunda.
I have no plans to do so.	Nta gahunda mfite yo kubikora.
He thinks badly.	Yibwira nabi.
The way he works is a book.	Uburyo akora ni igitabo.
He needed to stop that.	Yari akeneye guhagarika ibyo.
I wanted to do it.	Nashakaga kubikora.
We have to think a little.	Tugomba gutekereza gato.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko atari byose.
You did it before.	Wigeze kubikora.
But that didn't work out.	Ariko ntabwo byagenze neza.
But I can't.	Ariko sinshobora.
Not just us.	Ntabwo ari twe gusa.
He doesn't want anything better.	Nta kintu na kimwe yifuza cyiza.
Saying something good.	Kuvuga ikintu cyiza.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
At times, he didn't even know it.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntiyari azi neza.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
They wouldn't do this.	Ntabwo bari gukora ibi.
The money was there.	Amafaranga yari ahari.
I feel it is better to make good food for children.	Ndumva ari byiza gukora ibiryo byiza kubana.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
He would be close.	Yaba ari hafi.
He wants to win.	Ashaka gutsinda.
But he did not agree.	Ariko ntacyo yemeye.
It was a way of talking to me.	Byari uburyo bwo kuvuga kuri njye.
You have to wait.	Ugomba gutegereza.
I really am.	Ndimo rwose.
Faith is not an idea.	Kwizera ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
And so it is.	Na we ni uko.
He is a bad boy.	Ni umuhungu mubi.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri.
The problem is, no.	Ikibazo ni, ntabwo.
If he does that, he can win.	Niba akora ibyo, arashobora gutsinda.
We have to try.	Tugomba kugerageza.
He could speak.	Yashoboraga kuvuga.
They actually had a reason to be.	Mubyukuri bari bafite impamvu yo kuba.
Many and one.	Benshi kandi umwe.
He was my age, but he was young.	Yari afite imyaka yanjye, ariko ni muto.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Obviously something is wrong.	Biragaragara ko hari ikintu kibi.
And you can't know the truth.	Kandi ntushobora kumenya ukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni byiza kuri ibyo.
That's not all.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo gusa.
But you have to be lucky.	Ariko ugomba kugira amahirwe.
I was just thinking.	Natekerezaga gusa.
To do so.	Kubikora.
I hope it is possible.	Nizera ko bishoboka.
He was not sure if he could say anything.	Ntiyari azi neza niba hari icyo ashobora kuvuga.
In fact, he didn't know much.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri ntabwo yari azi byinshi.
There is one more thing here.	Hano hari ikindi kintu kimwe.
But he did not go to find a teacher.	Ariko ntabwo yagiye gushaka umwarimu.
What he thought he had done.	Ibyo yatekerezaga ko yabikoze.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
You said you could.	Wavuze ko ushobora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He knew he could speak.	Yari azi ko ashobora kuvuga.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
The car was nearby.	Imodoka yari hafi.
I know this is true.	Nzi ko ibi ari ukuri.
That's why.	Ni impamvu.
I want something long, but not long.	Ndashaka ikintu kirekire, ariko ntabwo ari kirekire.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo bishoboka rwose.
And he is my friend.	Kandi ni inshuti yanjye.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He was not a friend.	Ntiyari inshuti.
I've seen a lot of them not.	Nabonye byinshi cyane sibyo.
I had only one idea.	Nari mfite igitekerezo kimwe gusa.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, ni byiza cyane.
He is my player.	Ni umukinnyi wanjye.
I can do nothing here.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora hano.
Anything else? 	Hari ikindi kintu?
We have a plan.	Dufite gahunda.
I don't like it here.	Ntabwo nkunda hano.
He went first.	Yagiye mbere.
Or would it be something else?	Cyangwa byari kuba ari ikindi kintu?
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
I am very happy to buy.	Nishimiye cyane kugura.
He is here right now.	Ari hano kuri ubu.
I'm glad he was here.	Nishimiye ko yari hano.
He didn't tell me.	Ntabwo yambwiye.
They are just friends.	Ni inshuti gusa.
He had a good friend.	Yari afite inshuti nziza.
We were really close.	Twari hafi rwose.
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
The boy knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Umuhungu yari azi neza ko agomba kuba ku ishuri.
No one should exist.	Nta n'umwe ugomba kubaho.
You have to be outside.	Ugomba kuba hanze.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
Nearby.	Hafi ya hafi.
I have too.	Nanjye mfite.
This is exactly what he wants to do.	Ibi nibyo rwose ashaka kubikora.
But he needs to take a lot of things.	Ariko akeneye gufata ibintu byinshi.
Tom knew he was expecting something in return.	Tom yari azi ko yari yiteze ko agira icyo avuga.
What he was up to.	Icyo yari arimo.
He went out for a long time.	Yagiye hanze igihe kirekire.
No one said.	Nta muntu yavuze.
You need someone like me.	Ukeneye umuntu nkanjye.
This is true.	Iyi ni ukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ukuri kuri ubu.
It's not going away.	Ntabwo ari kugenda.
The child has problems.	Umwana afite ibibazo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
As if it weren’t a big deal.	Nkaho atari ikibazo kinini.
Or maybe it's not.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byo.
You can tell me.	Urashobora kumbwira.
They know full well that they know how to work.	Bazi neza ko bazi gukora.
You are something to watch.	Uri ikintu cyo kureba.
That's right.	Nibyo.
That's what he was for.	Ibyo ni byo yari kuri we.
Type.	Turi.
Tom will do it tomorrow.	Tom azabikora ejo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ni ukuri.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
They didn't know it was here.	Ntabwo bari bazi ko ari hano.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
He was.	Yari we.
You know where you want to eat, tell me.	Uzi aho ushaka kurya, mbwira.
I have good friends.	Mfite inshuti nziza.
I love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
Where he did not know for sure.	Aho atari azi neza.
He didn't look like her.	Ntabwo yasaga na we.
He is not your friend.	Ntabwo ari inshuti yawe.
I'm not.	Ntabwo ndimo.
He had his own plan.	Yari afite gahunda ye wenyine.
He enjoyed everything he saw.	Yishimiye ibyo yabonye byose.
But he is a very good teacher.	Ariko ni umwarimu mwiza cyane.
It's a bad idea.	Ni igitekerezo kibi.
She was beautiful and beautiful.	Yari mwiza kandi mwiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
And he was good to her.	Kandi yari mwiza kuri we.
It seems difficult.	Birasa nkaho bigoye.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
He was in the same room.	Yari mu cyumba kimwe.
I guess not.	Ndakeka ko atari byo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
Downstairs was a lot here.	Hasi yari menshi hano.
He was there at the time.	Icyo gihe yari ahari.
He had no one.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari afite.
Why does he do it?	Kuki abikora?
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
We are on top.	Turi hejuru.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I really want to do this.	Ndashaka rwose gukora ibi.
He is a young player.	Ni umukinnyi muto.
You just can't do it.	Ntushobora gukora gusa.
I wasn’t working hard.	Ntabwo nari nkora cyane.
After all, everything went well.	Nyuma, ibintu byose byagenze neza.
What does he want from us?	Arashaka iki kuri twe?
They had none.	Ntabwo bari bafite.
Before he could do that, he was on his side.	Mbere yuko agira icyo akora, yari kuri we.
Tell me the same thing.	Mbwira kimwe.
He is just a boy.	Ni umuhungu gusa.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
There is more to this.	Hariho byinshi kuri ibi.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
In front of everyone.	Imbere ya bose.
He can also.	Ashobora kandi.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
I can't wait to see what it is.	Sinshobora gutegereza kureba icyo aricyo.
There is always so much to have.	Buri gihe hariho byinshi byo kugira.
If that's the case then you are right.	Niba aribyo ushaka kuvuga birashoboka rwose.
They were both numerous.	Bombi bari benshi.
Someone was in the house.	Umuntu yari muri iyo nzu.
He can do it and be smart enough to do it.	Arashobora rwose kandi afite ubwenge bihagije kubikora.
He is a smart boy.	Ni umuhungu uzi ubwenge.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
No need to stop.	Nta mpamvu yo guhagarika.
Very good question.	Ikibazo cyiza cyane.
I just know that people are scared.	Gusa nzi ko abantu bafite ubwoba.
My whole family did it.	Umuryango wanjye wose wabikoze.
He was not who he was supposed to be.	Ntabwo yari uwo yagombaga kuba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You have to eat.	Ugomba kurya.
He was gone now.	Yari yagiye ubu.
I don't have to.	Ntagomba.
It's nice and easy on the inside.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye imbere.
You can feel alone.	Urashobora kumva uri wenyine.
That did not happen.	Nibyo ntabwo byagenze.
Not any day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi uwo ari wo wose.
We had nothing to do with it.	Ntacyo twari dufite cyo kubikora.
He wanted a lot of time.	Yashakaga igihe kinini.
I'm not a guy.	Ntabwo ndi umusore.
I didn't have time for that.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya kubyo.
What he saw.	Ibyo yabonye.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
You can go home.	Urashobora gutaha.
I saw.	Nabonye.
He was well aware that he could do something about it.	Yari azi neza ko ashobora kugira icyo akora.
They are real people and they are human beings.	Ni abantu rwose kandi ni abantu.
This is a bad idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo kibi.
You have to work hard.	Ugomba gukora cyane.
This was good for him.	Ibi byari byiza kuri we.
You.	Wowe.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
She knew she was her father's daughter.	Yari azi ko ari umukobwa wa se.
But the same thing.	Ariko ikintu kimwe.
You may not know what you want today.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo uzi ko ushaka muri iki gihe.
You have to think.	Ugomba gutekereza.
He didn't have to do it.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubikora.
I got the first phone call.	Nabonye terefone ya mbere.
There is a plan here.	Hano hari gahunda.
He used to watch here.	Yakundaga kureba hano.
You can look up.	Urashobora kureba hejuru.
I know he did.	Nzi ko yabikoze.
But the phone first.	Ariko terefone mbere.
I can't drink or eat.	Sinshobora kunywa cyangwa kurya.
He works hard every day.	Akora cyane buri munsi.
It was a wonderful day.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane.
And it is a family.	Kandi ni umuryango.
I have to go to work.	Ngomba kujya ku kazi.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
And they knew why.	Kandi bari bazi impamvu.
That is definitely not the case.	Ko rwose atari byo.
I can't even think.	Sinshobora no gutekereza.
You have the opportunity to make many friends.	Ufite amahirwe yo kugira inshuti nyinshi.
I am very happy to do so.	Nishimiye cyane kubikora.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He doesn't have to talk to you every day.	Ntabwo agomba kuvugana nawe buri munsi.
I like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo.
What an idea.	Igitekerezo ni iki.
It is.	Ndi.
It didn't look like it.	Ntabwo yasaga nkaho.
He has a good plan.	Afite gahunda nziza.
And here he was.	Kandi hano yari.
And in fact, that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Kandi mubyukuri birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
They have a lot to say about this.	Bafite byinshi byo kuvuga kuri ibi.
No one inside or outside.	Nta muntu n'umwe cyangwa hanze.
I want a lot of time.	Ndashaka igihe kinini.
They are not human beings.	Ntabwo ari abantu.
I ask why.	Ndabaza impamvu.
You are thirty.	Ufite mirongo itatu.
He would not have stopped this.	Ntabwo yari guhagarika ibi.
Good day to go.	Umunsi mwiza wo kugenda.
I can't be.	Ntabwo nshobora kuba.
I thought I was the only one.	Natekereje ko ari njye wenyine.
If not, then so be it.	Niba kandi atari byo, ntabwo aribyo.
I can't live.	Ntabwo nshobora kubaho.
You can tell on.	Urashobora kubwira kuri.
Maybe you can try this.	Birashoboka ko ushobora kugerageza ibi.
Apparently he has a reading problem.	Biragaragara ko afite ikibazo cyo gusoma.
How can you do that.	Nigute ushobora kubikora.
Tell me your day.	Mbwira umunsi wawe.
Me too, in fact.	Nanjye, mubyukuri.
As if one could see and hear everything.	Nkaho umuntu yashoboraga kubona no kumva byose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He was not ready to hear the truth.	Ntiyari yiteguye kumva ukuri.
I've never heard of that before.	Sinigeze numva ibyo mbere.
I don't need any money to buy it.	Ntacyo nkeneye amafaranga ashobora kugura.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba ndi hano.
I thought we were family.	Natekerezaga ko turi umuryango.
I have.	Mfite.
They were scared and scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba kandi bafite ubwoba.
That's what he needs.	Icyo ni cyo akeneye.
He was looking bad.	Yashakaga nabi.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
I knew better than that.	Nari nzi neza kuruta ibyo.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
He was.	Yari we.
He chose to come.	Yahisemo kuza.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
He knew he couldn't do it, and you could.	Yari azi ko adashobora kubikora, kandi urashobora.
I should have lived with you.	Nari nkwiye kubana nawe.
Or he started.	Cyangwa yatangiye.
Today is the first day, so far so good.	Uyu munsi ni umunsi wa mbere, kugeza ubu ni byiza cyane.
We are here.	Turi hano.
He thought he was lucky.	Yatekereje ko afite amahirwe.
One was today.	Umwe yari uyu munsi.
He thought to himself, how one works.	Yatekereje kuri we, uburyo umuntu akora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I thought to myself.	Natekereje muri njye.
But not all people are very lucky.	Ariko ntabwo abantu bose bafite amahirwe menshi.
He should not drink too much.	Ntagomba kunywa cyane.
I have to talk to him alone.	Ngomba kuvugana na we wenyine.
Women, women.	Akazi, akazi.
In fact, many.	Mubyukuri, benshi.
But to do more.	Ariko gukora byinshi.
We would make a lot of money.	Twari kubona amafaranga menshi.
You were me.	Wari njye.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
Where are the children?	Abana bari he?
But in reality, like.	Ariko mubyukuri, nka.
Bose.	Bose.
She eventually got her favorite job.	Amaherezo yaje kubona akazi yakundaga.
You have to tell me the truth.	Ugomba kumbwira ukuri.
Here and there.	Hano na hano.
I need to take a good look.	Nkeneye kureba neza.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
Probably a friend of yours.	Birashoboka ko ari inshuti yawe.
I found it a problem.	Nabonye ko ari ikibazo.
Apparently up to.	Biragaragara kugeza kuri.
He was too.	Na we yari.
He seemed to be about to speak.	Yasaga naho yari hafi kuvuga.
The house, however, was gone.	Inzu ariko yari yagiye.
There was something he could know for sure.	Hariho ikintu yashoboraga kumenya neza.
He was not happy about that.	Ntabwo yari yishimiye ibyo.
That's not what reading is all about.	Ibyo gusoma ntabwo aribyo.
We have to eat at that time.	Tugomba kurya icyo gihe.
He will be tonight.	Azaba muri iri joro.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
At first he seemed scared.	Mbere yari asa naho afite ubwoba.
I'm glad you have the money.	Nishimiye ko ufite amafaranga.
But it is clear that it is good.	Ariko biragaragara ko ari byiza.
I know it's possible.	Nzi ko bishoboka.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
My youngest son.	Umuhungu wanjye muto.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Is that right? 	Nibyo se?
Almost as bad.	Hafi nkaho ari mubi.
Where you have everything, however, is nothing.	Aho ufite byose, ariko, ntacyo.
I really have to think.	Ngomba rwose gutekereza.
My wife does it here.	Umugore wanjye abikora hano.
I didn’t mean to say though.	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ariko.
Nothing wrong.	Nta kibi.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
If he is out, he cannot be far away.	Niba ari hanze, ntashobora kuba kure.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Abantu bose ni ko byagenze.
You can find friends.	Urashobora kubona inshuti.
It was not far.	Ntiyari kure.
I understand why.	Ndumva neza impamvu.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
You should have known better.	Wari ukwiye kumenya neza.
Something I heard.	Hari ikintu numvise.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
This, in fact, is what he wants.	Ibi, mubyukuri, icyo ashaka.
But it's out here.	Ariko iri hanze aha.
If you are new friends.	Niba uri inshuti nshya.
I thought.	Ndatekereza.
Have you seen a new movie recently?	Wabonye firime nshya vuba aha?
He was a little far away.	Yari kure gato.
You told the truth for the first time.	Wavuze ukuri bwa mbere.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
Most people only have one.	Abantu benshi bafite umwe gusa.
It is not now, or when it is too far away.	Ntabwo ari ubu, cyangwa iyo ari kure cyane.
The children were there.	Abana bari aho.
He has.	Afite.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
But it really doesn't matter.	Ariko ntabwo rwose nta kibazo.
I just wanted my baby.	Nashakaga gusa umwana wanjye.
He was not happy about that.	Ntabwo yishimiye ibyo.
Yesterday was that day.	Ejo wari uwo munsi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
From here.	Kuva aha.
He knows nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe azi neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Up.	Hejuru.
Glad he went.	Yishimiye ko yagiye.
You have a plan.	Ufite gahunda.
That is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri mubyukuri.
You did it right.	Wabikoze neza.
The boy will never speak.	Umuhungu ntazigera avuga.
Helping people.	Gufasha abantu.
It's best to go home.	Nibyiza gusubira murugo.
Can you swim?	Urashobora koga?
It's something you have.	Ni ikintu ufite.
Nearby.	Hafi ya hafi.
That's it.	Iyo ni.
He looked inside her.	Yarebye imbere muri we.
I'm not sure what happened.	Sinzi neza uko byagenze.
This person has never been lucky.	Uyu muntu ntabwo yigeze agira amahirwe.
He didn't know his place, that's for sure.	Ntabwo yari azi umwanya we, nibyo rwose.
No one has time to read.	Nta muntu ufite umwanya wo gusoma.
He started working.	Yatangiye gukora.
It will be this.	Bizaba iyi.
We have to go now.	Tugomba kugenda ubu.
No problem trying.	Nta kibazo cyo kugerageza.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I knew.	Nari nzi.
I didn't know how to do it.	Sinari nzi kubikora.
I never really saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona mubyukuri.
And for me, there is no turning back.	Kandi kuri njye, nta gusubira inyuma.
You have to read his book.	Ugomba gusoma igitabo cye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
I can only read.	Nshobora gusoma gusa.
I never used to drive.	Sinigeze nkunda gutwara imodoka.
He didn't deserve it.	Ntabwo yari akwiye.
I think that will be great.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bizaba byiza cyane.
He is someone who wants to be close.	Ni umuntu ushaka kuba hafi.
I would know the truth!	Nari kumenya ukuri!
And he said that's it.	Kandi yavuze ko aribyo.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atagomba.
He seemed scared.	Yasaga naho afite ubwoba.
I'm going to.	Ngiye ku.
It was also difficult to learn.	Byari bigoye kandi kwiga.
It seems.	Birasa.
I want to say goodbye.	Ndashaka kuvuga neza.
I can't think of anything else.	Sinshobora gutekereza ikindi kintu.
This is not good enough.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
He had.	Yari afite.
No looking.	Nta kureba.
It's a great movie.	Ni firime nziza cyane.
Almost alone.	Hafi ya hafi na wenyine.
Or who he was.	Cyangwa uwo yari we.
He agreed to drive.	Yemeye gutwara.
Just so far.	Gusa kugeza kure.
I have a place to go.	Mfite aho dushobora kujya.
I know there is a lot to it.	Nzi ko hari byinshi kuri byo.
I need this.	Nkeneye ibi.
I’m really excited to go back.	Nishimiye rwose gusubira inyuma.
Me, this is me.	Njye, uyu ni njye.
He absolutely must.	Agomba rwose.
He started the house.	Yatangiye inzu.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
I think it will be good.	Ntekereza ko bizaba byiza.
I wanted to go home.	Nashakaga gutaha.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
The house was nice and nice.	Inzu yari nziza kandi nziza.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko aribyo.
That's not fair.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri ibyo.
He asked a question at the meeting.	Yabajije ikibazo muri iyo nama.
I did it once.	Nigeze kubikora rimwe.
It was his fault.	Byari amakosa ye.
Everything you need.	Ikintu cyose ukeneye.
In any case,	Ibyo ari byo byose,
I ask a lot of questions.	Ndabaza byinshi.
It is impossible to win.	Ntabwo bishoboka gutsinda.
No need to ask for money.	Nta no gusaba amafaranga.
It will be.	Bizaba.
That was really true for me.	Ibyo rwose byari ukuri kuri njye.
We had a plan.	Twari dufite gahunda.
I don't have to talk to you.	Ntabwo ngomba kuvugana nawe.
But it was a good thing.	Ariko byari ibintu byiza.
I had enough of that.	Nari mfite ibyo bihagije.
In the short term, whatever it is.	Mu gihe gito, ibyo aribyo byose.
He was in it.	Yari muri we.
He wouldn't tell me.	Ntabwo yari kumbwira.
He did not know what it was.	Ntiyari azi icyo ari cyo.
Here is the truth.	Hano hari ukuri.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
I don't want this.	Sinshaka ibi.
Not much to say.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo kuvuga.
But that is not the case at all.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo rwose.
You don't have to do this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi.
This is not easy for him.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye kuri we.
He did very well.	Yakoze neza cyane.
That's good!	Nibyiza!
I don't know who.	Sinzi uwo.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
I feel so good.	Ndumva ko ari mwiza cyane.
There is only one thing to do.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa cyo gukora.
A lot of this you need to know.	Ibi byinshi ugomba kumenya.
I really think so.	Rwose ndimo ntekereza.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
But if so.	Ariko niba aribyo.
Probably not at all.	Birashoboka ko atari na rimwe.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
She knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko ari mwiza.
I don't know what happened.	Ntabwo nzi uko byagenze.
Or plan.	Cyangwa gahunda.
You can't imagine who he is.	Ntushobora gutekereza aho uwo ari.
The money has gone too far.	Amafaranga yagiye kure cyane.
She is very embarrassed.	Afite isoni cyane.
I mean, that's normal.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ibyo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
You have to read.	Ugomba gusoma.
You don't really know what that is.	Ntabwo rwose uzi neza icyo.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
But she was a beautiful girl.	Ariko yari umukobwa mwiza.
Did you know he will do it.	Wari uziko azabikora.
He never did anything good.	Ntabwo yigeze akora ikintu cyiza.
I shouldn’t have done that.	Sinari nkwiye kubikora.
You have to stop that.	Ugomba guhagarika ibyo.
Not every night.	Ntabwo buri joro.
I wanted to know more.	Nashakaga kumenya neza.
What did you say	Wavuze iki?
They have problems.	Bafite ibibazo.
Really, really.	Nukuri, nukuri.
I really am.	Nukuri ndi.
I did a lot.	Nagize byinshi.
I heard.	Numvise.
I believe that is not true.	Ndizera ko ibyo atari ukuri.
Over time	Kurenza igihe.
I like to talk during meals.	Nkunda kuvuga mugihe cyo kurya.
Or a car ?.	Cyangwa imodoka?.
Someone in it.	Umuntu muri we.
That's what happened.	Byagenze gutya.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
And he said he was not the only one.	Kandi yavuze ko atari we wenyine.
I know we can.	Nzi ko dushobora.
I never thought of a problem.	Sinigeze ntekereza ikibazo.
He says he needs the money.	Avuga ko akeneye amafaranga.
And it started with nothing.	Kandi yatangiye nta kintu.
You must have seen it.	Ugomba kuba wabonye.
I'm not sure what that is.	Sinzi neza icyo aricyo.
I knew.	Nari nzi.
He says it's easy to do.	Avuga ko byoroshye gukora.
He had not accepted anything.	Ntabwo yari yemeye ikintu na kimwe.
He had to drink well.	Yagombaga kunywa neza.
I've seen enough.	Nabonye bihagije.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It really wasn't a problem for us.	Ntabwo rwose byari ikibazo kuri twe.
Niki ?.	Niki?.
You don't want anything here.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushaka hano.
Only the clothes are behind you.	Gusa imyenda iri inyuma yawe.
There is always.	Buri gihe hariho.
He had children.	Yari afite abana.
It's a wonderful thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyane.
I don't want to stay here.	Sinshaka kuguma hano.
I'm sure it was good.	Nzi neza ko byari byiza.
You can't be.	Ntushobora kuba.
He even started talking to me.	Yatangiye no kuvugana nanjye.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
Obviously that is true.	Biragaragara ko ari ukuri.
Only.	Gusa.
He wanted to stay.	Yashakaga kuguma.
I'm not feeling well today.	Ntabwo ndimo kuba mwiza muri iki gihe.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
It was a wonderful gift.	Byari impano nziza cyane.
But you got to see it tomorrow.	Ariko wabonye kubona ejo.
He was here.	Hano yari.
I do not mean.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga.
I don’t really have much to say.	Ntabwo mfite byinshi byo kuvuga mubyukuri.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
'	'
He may not know it.	Ashobora kuba atari azi.
I'm not working hard.	Ntabwo nkora cyane.
These were real people.	Aba bari abantu rwose.
He saw a long way off.	Yabonye kugenda kure.
He wants to play.	Ashaka gukina.
Of course, this is good enough.	Nukuri, ibi nibyiza bihagije.
You have a lot to say.	Ufite byinshi byo kuvuga.
And that was as far away as I could ever see.	Kandi ibyo byari kure nkuko nabonye mbere.
He always says what he wants to say.	Buri gihe avuga icyo ashaka kuvuga.
And here it is.	Kandi ibi ni hano.
He didn’t want to look away.	Ntiyashakaga kureba kure.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko agomba gukora vuba.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
Good.	Byiza.
We have to go now.	Tugomba kugenda ubu.
He thought they were both.	Yibwiraga ko bombi.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I wanted something good.	Nashakaga ikintu cyiza.
He chose to do what he did.	Yahisemo gukora ibyo yakoze.
I need to get a job.	Nkeneye kubona akazi.
Probably her.	Birashoboka ko we.
I have to go quickly.	Ngomba kugenda vuba.
I am a girl.	Ndi umukobwa.
Favorite family.	Umuryango ukunda.
It worked out well for everyone.	Byagenze neza kuri buri wese.
But it’s something to think about.	Ariko ni ikintu cyo gutekereza.
I'm not going to do anything wrong.	Ntabwo ngiye gukora ikintu kibi.
The girl was.	Umukobwa yari.
Here, in this room.	Hano, muri iki cyumba.
.	.
He is always on time.	Buri gihe aba ari ku gihe.
Everyone has things.	Umuntu wese afite ibintu.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He can go where he wants.	Arashobora kujya aho ashaka.
He was now a man.	Ubu yari umuntu.
He went.	Yagiye.
But there is so much to see here.	Ariko hano hari byinshi byo kubona hano.
You have a good family.	Ufite umuryango mwiza.
Maybe they have a problem, maybe.	Birashoboka ko bafite ikibazo, birashoboka.
We have a family.	Dufite umuryango.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
We have to eat.	Tugomba kurya.
You have to live.	Ugomba kubaho.
I don’t know if we can do more.	Sinzi niba dushobora gukora byinshi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It can't be far.	Ntashobora kuba kure.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, ni byiza cyane.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Sinzi icyo gukora, mubyukuri.
It’s not just an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa.
I didn't need to.	Sinari nkeneye.
But he did not come as he had.	Ariko ntabwo yaje nk'uko yari afite.
I'm very worried.	Mfite impungenge nyinshi.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi uko byari kugenda.
Most of us were.	Benshi muri twe bari.
Today I saw something.	Uyu munsi nabonye ikintu.
He wasn't sure if he wanted to.	Ntiyari azi neza ko ashaka.
Good.	Byiza.
I am here and you have to learn to live with me.	Ndi hano kandi ugomba kwiga kubana nanjye.
She thinks she is beautiful.	Yibwira ko ari mwiza.
And no one.	Kandi nta muntu.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo gukora.
He is lucky.	Afite amahirwe.
I have never heard of such a thing.	Sinigeze numva uburyo ibyo bishoboka.
I felt really good.	Numvise rwose ari byiza.
Later now here.	Nyuma ubu hano.
Later, he said, but not now.	Nyuma, yavuze, ariko si ubu.
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
No going.	Nta kugenda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
He did well for her.	Yakoze neza kuri we.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
Good on you.	Nibyiza kuri.
That won't be good for me.	Ibyo ntabwo bizaba byiza kuri njye.
I hope all together.	Nizere ko byose hamwe.
I think it would be nice.	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza.
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
In any case, he could not speak, he did not speak.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo yashoboraga kuvuga, ntiyigeze avuga.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
I am very sorry for the inconvenience.	Mbabajwe cyane n'iki kibazo.
And it's good.	Kandi ni mwiza.
They knew better.	Bari bazi neza.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
He could see well enough.	Yashoboraga kubona neza bihagije.
He is right, once.	Afite ukuri, rimwe.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I really heard it before.	Nukuri numvise mbere.
You are a woman.	Uri umugore.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
He said he was not present.	Yavuze ko atigeze ahari.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
He is one of us.	Ni umwe muri twe.
He did nothing.	Nta cyo yakoze.
It would be hard to stay human.	Byari kuba bigoye kuguma umuntu.
It looks like.	Birasa nkaho.
We are up now.	Turi hejuru ubu.
This is especially true.	Iyi cyane cyane.
I am not now.	Ntabwo ndi ubu.
But sometimes it is very, very, very clear.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe biragaragara cyane, cyane, biragaragara cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Everyone can be one.	Umuntu wese arashobora kuba umwe.
I haven't heard from him since.	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze numva.
He has a lot of problems.	Afite ibibazo byinshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You have to have an idea.	Ugomba kugira igitekerezo.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
But he did nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yakoze.
Very well, maybe.	Byiza cyane, birashoboka.
She was not a good girl.	Ntiyari umukobwa mwiza.
He said he needed time to think.	Yavuze ko akeneye igihe cyo gutekereza.
You need to know how to do it right.	Ugomba kumenya kubikora neza.
The children were nearby.	Abana bari hafi.
The book is good, he said, but.	Igitabo ni cyiza, yavuze, ariko.
I was sure that would happen.	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo byari kubaho.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo yari akeneye.
A thinking woman.	Umugore utekereza.
He also started playing.	Yatangiye no gukina.
I can't stay.	Sinshobora kuguma.
You are not really.	Ntabwo uri mubyukuri.
That.	Ibyo.
He didn't look at anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yarebye.
Everything.	Byose.
And he was beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza.
He was not ready.	Ntiyari yiteguye.
Good for everyone.	Nibyiza kuri bose.
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
It would be nice.	Byaba ari byiza.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
Something for everyone.	Ikintu kuri buri wese.
He had said what he was saying and that was it.	Yari yavuze ibyo avuga kandi aribyo.
I'm really, really not here or here.	Ndi mubyukuri, ntabwo ndi hano cyangwa hano.
They didn’t have much in everything.	Ntabwo bari bafite byinshi muri byose.
If not, that's fine.	Niba atari byo, nibyiza.
Something you said this morning.	Hari icyo wavuze muri iki gitondo.
They are many now.	Ni benshi ubu.
'	'
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo sibyo rwose.
We are all here now.	Twese turi hano ubu.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
But it will be better.	Ariko bizaba byiza.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Nzi neza ko bizaba byiza.
But that’s just it.	Ariko ibyo nibyo gusa.
It is a daily thing.	Ni ikintu cya buri munsi.
I was at school.	Nari ku ishuri.
He has a lot of talent.	Afite impano nyinshi.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
Of course, he can do that.	Ni ukuri, arashobora kubikora.
This is a great time.	Uyu ni umwanya mwiza.
But he was a working man.	Ariko yari umuntu ukora.
I feel at home.	Numva ari murugo.
I think he is here.	Ntekereza ko ari hano.
We are behind.	Turi inyuma.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
I love everything.	Nkunda byose.
Your daughter is alone.	Umukobwa wawe ari wenyine.
I never felt so young.	Sinigeze numva ko ndi muto cyane.
Just not today.	Gusa si uyu munsi.
Thinking alone.	Gutekereza wenyine.
I'm not scared.	Ntabwo mfite ubwoba.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
They were not going well.	Ntabwo bari kugenda neza.
I wanted to know everything.	Nashakaga kumenya byose.
I thought he was a good person.	Natekerezaga ko ari umuntu mwiza.
I had a job.	Nari mfite akazi.
It is my family.	Ni umuryango wanjye.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
Since I was three years old.	Kuva mfite imyaka itatu.
She now has a child.	Ubu afite umwana.
And yes, I realize I'm the billionth person to make that joke.	Hamwe nibyo, kuri.
He went swimming every day.	Yagiye koga buri munsi.
Is it possible?	Birashoboka?
Doing something.	Gukora ikintu.
I shouldn't say.	Ntabwo nkwiye kuvuga.
It's just here, in this room.	Ari hano gusa, muri iki cyumba.
Instead of being one for each.	Aho kuba umwe kuri buri.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
There is a way of.	Hariho uburyo bwa.
And you can't.	Kandi ntushobora.
That's right, with.	Nibyo, hamwe na.
'	'
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
I'm not going to live like that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubaho gutya.
I really needed it.	Nari nkeneye cyane.
I need to know something else.	Nkeneye kumenya ikindi kintu.
I know he was in it.	Nzi ko yari muri we.
He sits where he feels.	Yicaye aho yumva.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
They were not in front of him, they were above him.	Ntabwo bari imbere ye, bari hejuru ye.
And that is not a trivial matter.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari ikintu gito.
Very nice house.	Inzu nziza cyane.
Outside.	Hanze.
He knew nothing about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi kuri ibyo.
It's really hard.	Mubyukuri ibintu bigoye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza.
Anyone can see.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubona.
He needs to know if he feels the same way.	Agomba kumenya niba nawe yumva ibintu kimwe.
No one is scared.	Nta muntu ufite ubwoba.
I know it was good.	Nzi ko byari byiza.
Absolutely a problem.	Ikibazo rwose.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
All this time.	Iki gihe cyose.
Apparently this person has a drinking problem.	Biragaragara ko uyu muntu afite ikibazo cyo kunywa.
I don’t have much to do with any of that.	Ntabwo mfite byinshi byo gukora na kimwe muri byo.
I can be lucky.	Nshobora kugira amahirwe.
She is terrified.	Afite ubwoba bwo hejuru.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
It was like that.	Byari uko.
It's easy.	Ni ibintu byoroshye.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
There is a problem for me.	Hariho ikibazo kuri njye.
You can, you can definitely do it.	Urashobora, urashobora kubikora rwose.
At the time, that was normal.	Icyo gihe ibyo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
Everyone has the truth.	Umuntu wese afite ukuri.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
It’s not just school.	Ntabwo ari ishuri gusa.
If he's here, that's fine.	Niba ari hano, ni byiza.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
He chose to buy clothes.	Yahisemo kugura imyenda.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
There was nothing that one could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe umuntu yashoboraga gukora icyo gihe.
It was good to go.	Kugenda byari byiza.
You can do anything.	Urashobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I don't want to think.	Ntashaka gutekereza.
This is obviously not good.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari byiza.
I must have been very young.	Ngomba kuba nari muto cyane.
He wanted to do everything he wanted to do, but with him.	Yashakaga gukora ibyo yashakaga gukora byose, ariko hamwe na we.
I'm not a good woman.	Ntabwo ndi umugore mwiza.
Is it possible?	Birashoboka?
He was a dog.	Yari imbwa.
It is very possible that it is very possible.	Birashoboka cyane ko bishoboka cyane.
It was good but not good.	Yari mwiza ariko ntiyari mwiza.
He chose to buy.	Yahisemo kugura.
Are you looking for a girl or a boy?	Urashaka umukobwa cyangwa umuhungu?
I find it very good.	Njye mbona ari byiza cyane.
Me, me, me.	Njye, njye, njye.
I feel it but I feel nothing.	Ndumva ariko ntacyo numva.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Eventually, he moved on.	Amaherezo, yagiye imbere.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
'	'
I did things.	Nakoze ibintu.
He had a lot.	Yari afite byinshi.
The woman asked her father what he should do.	Umugore yabajije se icyo agomba gukora.
He applied for a job.	Yasabye akazi.
He was very alone.	Yari wenyine cyane.
But we are human.	Ariko turi abantu.
No one told me what he saw.	Nta muntu n'umwe yabwiye ibyo yabonye.
But I doubt I can do that.	Ariko ndashidikanya ko nshobora kubikora.
That is very close.	Ibyo ni hafi cyane.
One can see anything.	Umuntu arashobora kubona ikintu cyose.
He can't stay.	Ntashobora kuguma.
Especially this one.	Cyane cyane iyi.
He chose.	Yahisemo.
That was good for him.	Ibyo byari byiza kuri we.
Who can believe it.	Ninde ushobora kwizera.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
And that worked out well.	Kandi ibyo byagenze neza.
I wanted him to be scared.	Nashakaga ko agira ubwoba.
We have to work hard now.	Tugomba gukora cyane ubu.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
And very young.	Kandi muto cyane.
I have to have clothes.	Ngomba kugira imyenda.
He had a job to do.	Yari afite akazi ko gukora.
Today he had a party.	Uyu munsi yari afite ibirori.
One day, no problem.	Umunsi, nta kibazo.
All of this is normal.	Ibyo byose ni ibintu bisanzwe.
The reason he had come here.	Impamvu yari yaje hano.
You know he will do it alone.	Uzi ko azabikora wenyine.
He felt good.	Yumvise neza.
He never understood why.	Ntiyigeze yumva impamvu.
Up and up.	Hejuru kandi hejuru.
Up.	Hejuru.
Not particularly.	Ntabwo ari cyane cyane.
I shouldn't have come here.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuza hano.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
Every little thing.	Buri kintu gito.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
You can say a lot.	Urashobora kuvuga byinshi.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
Things to do and do.	Ibintu byo gukora no gukora.
He should not have lived.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kubaho.
He went to work.	Yagiye ku kazi.
I think I'm scared.	Ntekereza ko mfite ubwoba.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He was not in the house at all.	Ntabwo yari mu nzu rwose.
He was right about everything.	Yari afite ukuri kuri byose.
A little thing.	Ikintu gito.
Really good thing.	Ikintu cyiza rwose.
Everyone should look at this.	Umuntu wese agomba kureba kuri ibi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
He was alone at school.	Yari wenyine ku ishuri.
But that’s what we have.	Ariko nibyo dufite.
If he doesn't want to do something, he doesn't do it.	Niba adashaka gukora ikintu, ntabwo yabikoze.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
I think it's your age.	Ntekereza ko ari imyaka yawe.
It's not a small thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu gito.
Trying to figure out what happened.	Kugerageza kumenya uko byagenze.
Or your family.	Cyangwa umuryango wawe.
At home, at home.	Murugo murugo, murugo.
He is sitting very close.	Yicaye hafi cyane.
I can't stay.	Sinshobora kuguma.
He was not very young.	Ntiyari akiri muto cyane.
No one to talk to.	Nta muntu wo kuvugana.
Those are the questions of faith.	Ibyo ni ibibazo byo kwizera.
I didn’t really want the truth.	Sinifuzaga rwose ukuri.
It was hard to get everything right.	Byari bigoye kubona ikintu cyose neza.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
I can't see.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona.
Obviously you have something for me.	Biragaragara ko hari icyo ushaka kuri njye.
But they are people.	Ariko ni abantu.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
It's a good morning.	Hari mu gitondo cyiza.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
The child did well.	Umwana yakoze neza.
.	.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
It's clear.	Biragaragara neza.
Is there a house nearby?	Hafi aho hari inzu?
You really have to go, man.	Ugomba rwose kugenda, muntu.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
You can never do that, and that's fine.	Ntushobora na rimwe kubikora, kandi nibyiza.
But he didn't need to.	Ariko ntiyari akeneye.
Things are not good for us.	Ibintu ntabwo ari byiza kuri twe.
I have a problem though.	Mfite ikibazo ariko.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
He was not sure what to say.	Ntiyari azi neza icyo avuga.
You may be me.	Ushobora kuba ari njye.
It's something.	Ni ikintu.
He seemed to be.	Yasaga naho.
But here he was.	Ariko hano yari.
But we don’t have.	Ariko ntabwo dufite.
Much was the problem.	Byinshi byari ikibazo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I mean, really, really bad.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri, mubi rwose.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
I saw his friend.	Nabonye inshuti ye.
He was really here.	Yari hano rwose.
You don't know why he went.	Ntabwo uzi impamvu yagiye.
He gave gifts to all.	Yahaye abantu bose impano.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
I really don't see it.	Ntabwo mbona rwose.
This house is in us.	Iyi nzu iri muri twe.
He was also lucky.	Na we yagize amahirwe.
This would be a good thing.	Ibi byaba ari ibintu byiza.
And you can find out why.	Kandi ushobora kumenya impamvu.
It was great, by far.	Byari byiza cyane, kure.
I'm not sure about anything.	Ntabwo nzi neza ikintu na kimwe.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
He went after her.	Yagiye inyuma ye.
He could see nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
I have a problem.	Mfite ikibazo.
Her daughter looked good.	Umukobwa we yasaga neza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo byiza dushobora gukora.
And they were.	Kandi bari.
I like to play tennis.	Nkunda gukina tennis.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I can never.	Sinshobora na rimwe.
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
He looked away in embarrassment.	Yarebye kure afite isoni.
I can read a book.	Nshobora gusoma igitabo.
She thought she was my baby.	Yatekereje ko ari umwana wanjye.
You can do the same thing.	Urashobora gukora ikintu kimwe.
I can't believe he does.	Sinshobora kwizera ko abikora.
Stop thinking like that.	Reka gutekereza gutya.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
He needed to see things.	Yari akeneye kubona ibintu.
I think we can.	Ntekereza ko dushobora.
You can work from there.	Urashobora gukora kuva aho.
I don't like it here.	Ntabwo nkunda hano.
He can wait.	Ashobora gutegereza.
He had everything.	Yari afite ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
No one was behind him.	Nta muntu wari inyuma ye.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, agomba kumenya ko adashobora kugira icyo ashaka.
But he is scared.	Ariko afite ubwoba.
The day was bad.	Umunsi wari mubi.
I would do the same.	Nanjye nari kubikora.
I mean, it was for me.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko byari kuri njye.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo aribyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That’s a bad thing to say, but it’s true.	Icyo ni ikintu kibi cyo kuvuga, ariko ni ukuri.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
One very thing.	Ikintu kimwe cyane.
And no one did.	Kandi nta n'umwe wabikoze.
The problems were very difficult.	Ibibazo byari bigoye cyane.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
He chose to stay outside instead of staying in the house.	Yahisemo kuba hanze aho kuguma mu nzu.
I'm going home today.	Uyu munsi ngiye gutaha.
I was under him.	Nari munsi ye.
He said something good, all the time.	Yavuze ikintu cyiza, buri gihe.
He saw it from afar.	Yabonye kure.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He seems to be doing something really good.	Asa nkaho akora ibintu byiza rwose.
This is his plan.	Iyi ni gahunda ye.
And that's great.	Kandi ibyo nibyiza cyane.
I didn't know it would be so good.	Sinari nzi ko byaba byiza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza, nibyiza cyane.
It is not a very good book.	Ntabwo ari igitabo cyiza cyane.
He was happy to go.	Yishimiye kujyana.
I mean this.	Ndashaka kuvuga ibi.
Away.	Kure.
I don't know what he says.	Sinzi ibyo avuga.
Recently he seemed to be very low.	Vuba aha asa nkaho yari hasi cyane.
It was a small thing he knew.	Yari ikintu gito azi.
That's what he said.	Nibyo yari yavuze.
I'm going to take something.	Ngiye gufata ikintu.
I am looking for a job today.	Ndashaka akazi muri iki gihe.
It was not far.	Ntiyari kure.
I can't either.	Nanjye sinshobora.
This is a very bad time.	Iki ni igihe kibi cyane.
All with me.	Byose hamwe nanjye.
It’s the same with finding a way.	Ni kimwe no gushaka uburyo.
He has been in prison ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe yari muri gereza.
You have to be who you are.	Ugomba kuba uwo uri we.
Here, however,.	Hano, ariko ,.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kumenya ko ufite amahirwe menshi.
What did he mean by that.	Yashakaga kuvuga iki.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You don't look good.	Ntabwo usa neza.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ari ukuri.
He is here, in fact.	Ari hano, mubyukuri.
No one knew what had happened.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi uko byagenze.
I hope you know what you're doing.	Nizere ko uzi ibyo ukora.
It's not fair to say.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuvuga.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
But sometimes for no reason.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe nta mpamvu.
In fact, he never did.	Mubyukuri ntabwo yigeze abikora.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
Everything and everyone.	Byose na buri wese.
I can have everything.	Nshobora kugira byose.
He thought of her.	Yatekereje kuri we.
I can't stay.	Sinshobora kuguma.
If you work hard, you can succeed.	Niba ukora cyane, urashobora gutsinda.
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
Same here.	Kimwe hano.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
I know you want me too.	Nzi ko ushaka nanjye.
What do you think about that?	Uratekereza iki kuri ibyo?
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But this was true.	Ariko ibi byari ukuri.
Not when we are very close.	Ntabwo iyo turi hafi cyane.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
You don't think so.	Ntabwo utekereza neza.
Can you help ?.	Urashobora gufasha?.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
Not true here.	Ntabwo ari ukuri hano.
Until then there is work to be done.	Kugeza icyo gihe hari akazi ko gukora.
I saw it in the program.	Nabonye muri gahunda.
I was a young boy at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umuhungu muto.
Outside of.	Hanze ya.
Stop everything.	Guhagarika byose.
He is ready to do it.	Yiteguye kubikora.
As it happened.	Nkuko byagenze.
They have a lot to do.	Bafite byinshi byo gukora.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
I was sure this was a bad idea.	Nari nzi neza ko iki ari igitekerezo kibi.
.	.
Or for a short time.	Cyangwa igihe gito.
I want to be home again.	Ndashaka kongera kuba murugo.
It was a house.	Yari inzu.
That's good. 	Ibyo ni byiza.
'	'
I know what you mean.	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga.
You can't be my friend.	Ntushobora kuba inshuti yanjye.
You have nothing.	Ntacyo ufite.
I'm going to listen instead of talking.	Ngiye kumva aho kuvuga.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
Just a child.	Umwana gusa.
This would be great.	Ibi byaba byiza.
It’s not just backwards.	Ntabwo ari inyuma gusa.
We have to wait.	Tugomba gutegereza.
He may have been right.	Ashobora kuba yari afite ukuri.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
It started on its own when he had a small family.	Yatangiye wenyine igihe yari afite umuryango muto.
That is probably easier said than done.	Ibyo birashoboka ko byoroshye.
He has no good.	Nta cyiza afite.
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
It is not very outside.	Ntabwo ari hanze cyane.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
He did not know how or when.	Ntiyari azi uburyo cyangwa igihe.
I thought you were the only one.	Natekereje ko ari wowe wenyine.
He also loves to travel.	Akunda kandi kugenda.
He went first.	Yagiye mbere.
Ninde.	Ninde.
You know what you have.	Uzi icyo ufite.
We have to work now.	Tugomba gukora ubu.
And they were right.	Kandi bari bafite ukuri.
I know you can do this.	Nzi ko ushobora gukora ibi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I thought the same.	Natekereje kimwe.
Go back.	Gusubira inyuma.
I didn't even want to come here.	Sinifuzaga no kuza hano.
Absolutely.	Nukuri mubyukuri.
You can do it one day.	Urashobora kubikora umunsi umwe.
Who? 	Ninde?
He never wanted anything else.	Ntiyigeze ashaka ikindi kintu.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
The boy saw nothing.	Umuhungu ntacyo yabonye.
He loves to play.	Akunda gukina.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Ntiyari azi ikindi kintu yashoboraga gukora.
It's as beautiful as ever.	Ni mwiza nka mbere.
But it is not far away.	Ariko ntabwo ari kure.
I had a dog.	Nari mfite imbwa.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
I didn't know you were.	Sinari nzi ko uri.
You can only turn off your phone.	Urashobora guhagarika terefone yawe gusa.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
You were not.	Ntabwo wari.
Working and being one.	Gukora no kuba umwe.
He didn't tell me why.	Ntabwo yambwiye impamvu.
I saw one movie.	Nabonye firime rimwe.
a boy.	umuhungu.
But he was gone.	Ariko yari yagiye.
You know if.	Uzi niba.
We have no one here.	Nta muntu dufite hano.
I need advice.	Nkeneye inama.
We have no plans to do so.	Nta gahunda dufite yo kubikora.
We have to have.	Tugomba kugira.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
There was one thing he needed to do first, however.	Hariho ikintu kimwe yari akeneye gukora mbere, ariko.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
You have a bad person.	Ufite umuntu mubi.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Or that it is true for us, but it is not true for him.	Cyangwa ko ari ukuri kuri twe, ariko ntabwo ari ukuri kuri we.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa.
And there is something good about that.	Kandi ahari ikintu cyiza kuri ibyo.
You are very here.	Wowe hano cyane.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
And that's fine.	Kandi nibyiza.
When we are at home it is not.	Iyo turi murugo ntabwo.
She loves children.	Akunda abana.
Here is my movie.	Hano hari firime yanjye.
It is also possible to do this on your own.	Birashoboka kandi kubikora wenyine.
Is it my money?	Ni amafaranga yanjye?
He was not young.	Ntiyari akiri muto.
It was close.	Byari hafi.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza gutegereza.
I don't trust anyone very much.	Ntabwo nizera umuntu cyane.
Woman, young child.	Umugore, umwana muto.
I don’t think anyone knew it existed.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko hari umuntu wari uzi ko ahari.
You would do it.	Wari kubikora.
This is someone you love.	Uyu ni umuntu ukunda.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
That would be.	Ibyo byaba.
And here.	Kandi hano.
Or whatever you think would be good.	Cyangwa ibyo utekereza byose byaba byiza.
I don't want to talk to you	Sinshaka kuvugana nawe.
He is probably the first person to leave.	Birashoboka ko ari we muntu wa mbere kuva.
''	''.
You have to do this.	Ugomba gukora ibi.
And they have nothing to do with him.	Kandi ntacyo bafite kuri we.
OK, until.	Nibyiza, kugeza.
You can't think of anything.	Ntushobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe.
But far from all.	Ariko kure ya bose.
He says he can help find that person.	Avuga ko ashobora gufasha kubona uwo muntu.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
None of us felt the need to speak up.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wigeze yumva ko dukeneye kuvuga.
He is seeing.	Arimo kubona.
At that time they had a lot of money.	Icyo gihe bari bafite amafaranga menshi.
He never had a car.	Ntiyigeze agira imodoka.
Learning things on.	Kwiga ibintu kuri.
He left quickly.	Yagiye vuba.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
It was not a plan.	Ntabwo yari gahunda.
He can tell me.	Ashobora kumbwira.
I didn't want to be outside.	Sinifuzaga kuba hanze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
They have a reason.	Bafite impamvu.
But she was not a woman.	Ariko ntabwo yari umugore.
I love my family.	Nkunda umuryango wanjye.
He went.	Yagiye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
But it was not me.	Ariko ntabwo yari njye.
That's right.	Nukuri.
It was good for me.	Kuri njye byari byiza.
I have your gift.	Mfite impano yawe.
I just thought of something.	Gusa natekereje ku kintu.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
I have to do it.	Ngomba kubikora.
He had to be a dog.	Yagombaga kuba imbwa.
I wasn't good enough.	Ntabwo nari mwiza bihagije.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ni umukobwa mwiza.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
He did a lot.	Yakoze cyane.
I don’t think he should be.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko agomba kuba.
He was no longer one.	Ntabwo yari akiri umwe.
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza.
We have to learn a lot.	Tugomba kwiga byinshi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Same as	Kimwe na.
I don't want to.	Ntashaka.
He came to live with us.	Yaje kubana natwe.
But tell me.	Ariko mbwira.
No phone, please.	Nta terefone, nyamuneka.
It's just beautiful.	Ni mwiza gusa.
Work every morning.	Buri gitondo gukora.
However, this is just an idea.	Ariko, iki ni igitekerezo gusa.
I had a lot to think about.	Nari mfite byinshi byo gutekereza.
I think he will.	Ndakeka ko azabikora.
It was easy, really.	Byari byoroshye, mubyukuri.
But it was not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byari byoroshye.
She is scared.	Arimo agira ubwoba.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
You want the same.	Urashaka kimwe.
I knew everything.	Nari nzi byose.
The truth.	Ukuri.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
It's not like he was out drinking or anything.	Ntabwo ari nkaho yari hanze kunywa cyangwa ikindi kintu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She needs to look.	Akeneye kureba.
Who he is	Ni uwo ari we.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
It was good enough.	Byari byiza bihagije.
He needs to talk.	Akeneye kuvuga.
I'm so sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe cyane nuko bigoye.
There is a time for everything.	Hari igihe cya buri kintu.
Not just that.	Ntabwo bishoboka gusa.
This is not the room.	Ntabwo ari iki cyumba.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
I was a girl.	Nari umukobwa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
But he had done nothing.	Ariko nta cyo yari yakoze.
That's exactly what happened.	Nibyo rwose mubyukuri.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Here, there is only one.	Hano, hari umwe gusa.
We have to.	Tugomba.
He always does a lot.	Buri gihe akora byinshi.
I want to be a teacher.	Ndashaka kuba umwarimu.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
I did something good.	Nakoze ikintu cyiza.
Children especially.	Abana cyane cyane.
You have to think carefully.	Ugomba gutekereza neza.
We were here to help.	Twari hano gufasha.
Any problem, anytime.	Ikibazo cyose, igihe cyose.
You are close.	Uri hafi.
And he is right about that.	Kandi afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
He seemed worried.	Yasaga naho yari afite impungenge.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nibyo kuri ubu.
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
A very long time.	Igihe kinini cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
You can do this.	Urashobora gukora ibi.
We have to work.	Tugomba gukora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
He was young.	Yari akiri muto.
You can return to work tomorrow.	Urashobora gusubira ku kazi ejo.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
The little girl was beautiful.	Umukobwa muto yari mwiza.
You were beautiful.	Wari mwiza.
I know nothing about him.	Ntacyo nzi kuri we.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
I can play everything.	Nshobora gukina byose.
You were close to him.	Wari hafi ye.
But it would be a gift.	Ariko byari kuba impano.
I'm not sure what the idea is.	Ntabwo nzi neza igitekerezo icyo aricyo.
But so far.	Ariko kugeza ubu.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He never had one.	Nta n'umwe yigeze agira.
For anyone, anyone.	Ku muntu, umuntu uwo ari we wese.
There are a lot of people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi.
I had no problem with that.	Ntabwo nagize ikibazo kuri ibyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And he.	Na we.
I didn't know what he was talking about.	Sinari nzi ibyo avuga.
You can't work.	Ntushobora gukora.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
Being close to him.	Kuba hafi ye.
You want to win.	Ushaka gutsinda.
I want to make a cookie.	Ndashaka gukora kuki.
I want to be home.	Ndashaka kuba murugo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
We have to stop this.	Tugomba guhagarika ibi.
You were a boy.	Wari umuhungu.
I am grateful for the help.	Nishimiye ubufasha.
The first idea is everything.	Igitekerezo cya mbere ni byose.
He tried.	Yagerageje.
You don't like this.	Ntabwo ukunda ibi.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I want to say goodbye.	Ndashaka kuvuga neza.
He is doing well.	Agenda neza.
I was lucky today.	Uyu munsi nagize amahirwe.
I don't.	Ntabwo.
I have to say this.	Ngomba kuvuga ibi.
He liked that for her.	Yakundaga ibyo kuri we.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane.
He wants to talk.	Ashaka kuvuga.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Time to study alone.	Igihe cyo kwiga wenyine.
There are things to learn.	Hariho ibintu byo kwiga.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
That's it.	Ndimo.
From the first they have, to the last.	Kuva ku ya mbere bafite, kugeza ku ya nyuma.
It's just an idea.	Ni igitekerezo gusa.
You were so beautiful.	Wari mwiza cyane.
But there is more to it.	Ariko hariho byinshi kuri byo.
They were so many.	Bari benshi cyane.
I wanted to go far.	Nashakaga kujya kure.
He was there before.	Yari ahari mbere.
He never liked it.	Ntiyigeze akunda na gato.
She wants to study.	Ashaka kwiga.
He was not happy.	Ntabwo yishimiye.
And here I am.	Kandi hano ndi hano.
So far so good.	Nibyiza kugeza ubu.
I have never seen anyone talk to me.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona umuntu wo kuvugana.
If it is below.	Niba ari munsi.
He was thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
He was one.	Yari umwe.
I didn't know what to say.	Sinari nzi icyo avuga.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Oh, for one.	We, kuri umwe.
That you are here to stay.	Ko uri hano kuguma.
In that room.	Muri icyo cyumba.
This program is possible.	Iyi gahunda birashoboka.
I love how it happened.	Nkunda uko byagenze.
He always has.	Buri gihe afite.
He may not do this.	Ibi ashobora kutabikora.
I don’t see a lot of people.	Ntabwo mbona abantu benshi.
He said he did the same.	Yavuze ko na we yabikoze.
He believes in what he has.	Yizeye ibyo afite.
They were not human beings at all.	Ntabwo bari abantu rwose.
He wants it soon.	Arashaka vuba.
He lives here.	Aba hano.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
She thinks the baby is beautiful.	Yibwira ko umwana ari mwiza.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
That’s a big deal for me.	Icyo ni ikintu kinini kuri njye.
He was not really human.	Ntabwo rwose yari umuntu.
Only possible, but not here.	Gusa birashoboka, ariko ntabwo hano.
Or him.	Cyangwa we.
We have to stop this.	Tugomba guhagarika ibi.
He did not know for sure.	Ntabwo yari azi neza.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That's easy.	Ibyo byoroshye.
You can have anything you want.	Urashobora kugira icyo ushaka cyose.
But that is probably the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko aribyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane cyane.
But it is not good for me.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
He looked away in embarrassment.	Yarebye kure afite isoni.
I really believe this is true.	Ndizera rwose ko ibi ari ukuri.
He asked questions.	Yabajije ibibazo.
He seemed worried.	Yasaga naho afite impungenge.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
He knew he was right.	Yari azi ko avuga ukuri.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
This is one.	Aha ni hamwe.
It was just us and it was great.	Byari twe gusa kandi byari byiza cyane.
It would be a good idea.	Byaba igitekerezo cyiza.
It was just beautiful.	Yari mwiza gusa.
What to do.	Gukora iki.
The teacher is good.	Umwarimu ni mwiza.
He could do nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga gukora.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
And nowhere.	Kandi nta na hamwe.
He can go, he can't.	Ashobora kugenda, ntashobora.
I have that too.	Nanjye mfite ibyo.
He never lived.	Ntiyigeze aba.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Here, inside, you can see that he was right.	Hano, imbere, urashobora kubona ko yari afite ukuri.
He didn’t have it and he was there.	Ntabwo yari afite kandi yari ahari.
Her children were close to her.	Abana be bari hafi ye.
I want one.	Ndashaka umwe.
Not bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi.
Sometimes, it’s not recent.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntabwo ari vuba aha.
A child can know his father well.	Umwana arashobora kumenya neza se.
I want to go back to work.	Ndashaka gusubira ku kazi.
Either way, he may be at home.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ashobora kuba ari murugo.
But let that be.	Ariko reka ibyo.
It was a great learning experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane byo kwiga.
Probably tomorrow.	Birashoboka ejo.
He knew he had a problem.	Yari azi ko afite ikibazo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He has to be scared.	Agomba kugira ubwoba.
Together we can do that.	Twese hamwe dushobora kubikora.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
And a lot of it.	Kandi byinshi muri byo.
Why so many? 	Kuki ari benshi?
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
You didn't do it.	Ntabwo wabikoze.
I want it here now.	Ndashaka ko aha nonaha.
And they probably have the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
He does nothing.	Ntacyo akora.
Not here, not now.	Ntabwo ari hano, si ubu.
I am not sure of anything.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo aricyo cyose.
It's something.	Ni ikintu.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko.
I also know who his father is.	Nzi na se uwo ari we.
I don't know why or how it happened.	Sinzi impamvu cyangwa uko byagenze.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
I didn't have to go.	Sinari nkwiye kugenda.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
We were very close friends.	Twari inshuti cyane.
He had no job.	Nta kazi yari afite.
This morning, really.	Muri iki gitondo, rwose.
He thought he wanted to.	Yatekereje ko yashakaga.
It's been a while.	Hariho vuba aha.
We are worried.	Dufite impungenge.
It's you, isn't it?	Ni wowe, si byo?
It was just a matter of time.	Byari igihe gusa.
I want to have one of those.	Ndashaka kugira kimwe muri ibyo.
Let go of fear.	Kureka ubwoba.
He needed a little something.	Yari akeneye ikintu gito.
This one is going to work.	Uyu agiye gukora.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
But he saw nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
They have a daughter.	Bafite umukobwa.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
To take	Gufata.
He has a lot to do.	Afite byinshi byo gukora.
But whatever it is, man.	Ariko ibyo aribyo byose, muntu.
He was alone, as alone as one could be.	Yari wenyine, kimwe wenyine nkuko umuntu ashobora kuba.
I have to go again.	Ngomba kongera kugenda.
I had the same problem.	Nari mfite ikibazo kimwe.
He never said he had a daughter.	Ntiyigeze avuga ko afite umukobwa.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He needed something else.	Yari akeneye ikindi kintu.
I'm going back to school.	Ngiye gusubira ku ishuri.
I'm glad you can come.	Nishimiye ko ushobora kuza.
That he would see this for me.	Ko yari kubona ibi kuri njye.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
Knowing that he was close was enough.	Kumenya ko ari hafi byari bihagije.
But the same thing.	Ariko ikintu kimwe.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
This is not me.	Uyu si njye.
I'm here, man.	Ndi hano, muntu.
And we were right.	Kandi twari dufite ukuri.
You have that thing in front of you, alone.	Ufite icyo kintu imbere, wenyine.
You have to live.	Ugomba kubaho.
He was young.	Yari akiri muto.
In a short time, no one said.	Mu gihe gito, nta muntu wavuze.
That's right.	Icyo ari cyo.
But he was still young.	Ariko yari akiri muto.
He does it well.	Abikora neza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You knew what.	Wari uzi icyo.
She was a young girl.	Yari umukobwa muto.
He had not seen what he expected.	Ntabwo yari yabonye ibyo yari yiteze.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
I can't go.	Sinshobora kugenda.
Only one time.	Igihe kimwe gusa.
I wanted him to go.	Nashakaga ko agenda.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I have a lot of things to buy now.	Mfite ibintu byinshi byo kugura ubu.
I am his daughter.	Ndi umukobwa we.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ukeneye kumva gusa.
He doesn't know anyone outside.	Ntabwo ari uwo azi hanze.
Just a car.	Imodoka gusa.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
'	'
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
That's not what you have.	Ntabwo aribyo ufite.
That's exactly what he looks like.	Nibyo rwose uwo asa.
He saw a lot of things.	Yabonye ibintu byinshi.
And he did it very well.	Kandi ibyo yabikoze neza cyane.
All in all, it’s great.	Byose, ni byiza.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
Ari.	Ari.
He did a lot.	Yakoze byinshi.
Was he your friend?	Yari inshuti yawe?
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
He would be out.	Yaba ari hanze.
I know you do, but.	Nzi ko ukora, ariko.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
And there is no reason to do so.	Kandi nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
He is right.	Afite ukuri.
I think many.	Ntekereza ko benshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I don't feel like going.	Ntabwo numva nishimiye kugenda.
You can stay where you are tonight.	Urashobora kuguma aho iri joro.
It’s not just food.	Ntabwo ari ibiryo gusa.
I only want one.	Ndashaka umwe gusa.
I want everything you have.	Ndashaka ibyo ufite byose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
This is true, it is true.	Ibi ni ukuri, ni ukuri.
How long is the travel time?	Igihe cyo kugenda ni kirekire?
A woman who knew a lot.	Umugore wari uzi byinshi.
He said nothing and did nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze kandi ntacyo yakoze.
He thought you were beautiful.	Yatekereje ko uri mwiza.
Very good player.	Umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
He looked at her in front of him.	Yarebye aho yari ari imbere ye.
Eventually he returned to school.	Amaherezo yaje gusubira ku ishuri.
No need to return by bus.	Nta mpamvu yo gutaha muri bisi.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza kubona.
I think it was really good.	Ntekereza ko byari byiza rwose.
I have nothing.	Nta na kimwe mfite.
It looks really good.	Birasa neza rwose.
I never thought of taking anything.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza gufata ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
We have very little time.	Dufite igihe gito cyane.
You have to wait.	Ugomba gutegereza.
He has a lot of time for him, recently.	Afite igihe kinini kuri we, vuba aha.
He began to think clearly.	Yatangiye gutekereza neza.
He chose that to be enough.	Yahisemo ko ibyo bihagije.
But he did not want to go back, he did not.	Ariko ntiyashakaga gusubira inyuma, atari byo.
But he was still young.	Ariko yari akiri muto.
The last person said this.	Umuntu wa nyuma yavuze ibi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Everything.	Byose.
I think he is still a very good player.	Ntekereza ko akiri umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
He thought it was all right.	Yatekereje ko byagenze neza.
But it happened.	Ariko byagenze.
And that was good.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza.
I had children.	Nari mfite abana.
After you, things will be as they are.	Nyuma yawe, ibintu bizaba uko bizaba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
No one knew where he was going.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho yagiye.
Call if you need help.	Terefone niba ukeneye ubufasha.
Almost everything.	Hafi ya byose.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I want to hear the truth.	Ndashaka kumva ukuri.
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
That's not the point.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu.
But he heard why he wanted to leave.	Ariko yumvise impamvu yashakaga kugenda.
This is my favorite.	Ibi nibyo nkunda cyane.
It was very bad.	Byari byagenze nabi cyane.
I was sure it was something else.	Nari nzi neza ko ari ikindi kintu.
I can't go home.	Ntashobora gutaha.
It started.	Yatangiye.
He knew what to look for and what not to do.	Yari azi icyo gushaka icyo udashaka.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Sometimes, it’s a lot.	Rimwe na rimwe, ni byinshi.
He is a very bad person.	Ni umuntu mubi cyane.
He did not expect to win.	Ntabwo yari yiteze gutsinda.
And you do good things.	Kandi ukora ibintu byiza.
I am about three years old.	Mfite hafi imyaka itatu.
He would do nothing now.	Ntacyo yari gukora ubu.
He is confident.	Yizeye neza.
She loves to study.	Akunda kwiga.
I really like this thing.	Nkunda iki kintu rwose.
I didn’t think it was possible.	Sinatekerezaga ko bishoboka.
I mean they have a good movie.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko bafite firime neza.
You can't do everything on your own.	Ntushobora gukora byose wenyine.
You have	Ufite.
Na se.	Na se.
He didn't want to be.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuba.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
There is one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe.
But he could also do something about it.	Ariko yashoboraga no kugira icyo akora.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
A young child.	Umwana muto.
Or you shouldn't.	Cyangwa ntugomba.
But I don’t really see anything.	Ariko ntacyo mbona rwose.
He made my day.	Yagize umunsi wanjye.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
In.	Muri.
Stop talking.	Reka kuvuga.
Walking was a lot.	Kugenda byari byinshi.
He had heard nothing.	Nta kintu yari yumvise.
I had that.	Nari mfite ibyo.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
This is what it is.	Iki ni iki.
Everyone had an idea.	Umuntu wese yari afite igitekerezo.
It wasn’t just good.	Ntiyari mwiza gusa.
Movie time.	Igihe cya firime.
Or a car.	Cyangwa imodoka.
I didn't want to.	Ntabwo nashakaga.
He is playing fast.	Arimo gukina vuba.
'	'
One cannot know exactly anything.	Umuntu ntashobora kumenya neza ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
She is very smart.	Afite ubwenge cyane.
But he was good.	Ariko yari mwiza.
We were not very close to school.	Ntabwo twari hafi cyane ku ishuri.
Of course, he had friends.	Nibyo rwose, yari afite inshuti.
But that's right.	Ariko ibyo ni byo.
It’s not really a book.	Ntabwo rwose ari igitabo.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
I love children, especially my child.	Nkunda abana, cyane cyane umwana wanjye.
I hope I can help.	Ndizera ko nshobora gufasha.
I have to go back.	Ngomba gusubira inyuma.
The cost of not doing so will be huge.	Amafaranga yo kutabikora azaba menshi cyane.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
I love a guy.	Nkunda umusore.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He thought he had problems.	Yatekereje ko afite ibibazo.
It is not far from me to do so.	Ntabwo ari kure yanjye kubikora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari yatangiye.
They are here.	Bari hano.
His father watched.	Se yarebye.
He goes home.	Agiye murugo.
I know he will.	Nzi ko azabikora.
He did not know what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo ari cyo.
Where he was.	Aho yari ari.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu ibi.
Drinking is not good.	Kunywa ntabwo ari byiza.
It's a job.	Ni akazi.
But sometimes there are.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe hariho.
Three years.	Imyaka itatu.
I need to know what happened.	Ngomba kumenya uko byagenze.
I can work hard.	Nshobora gukora cyane.
Of course his wife had not come here.	Nukuri umugore we ntabwo yari yaje hano.
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Away from you	Kure yawe.
That's what he would do.	Nibyo yari gukora.
Time is money.	Igihe ni amafaranga.
I feel lucky to have made money.	Ndumva mfite amahirwe yo kubona amafaranga.
Is that right	Nibyo?
I wasn't sure if I did either.	Sinari nzi neza ko nanjye nakoze.
That's not good or bad.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza cyangwa byiza.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
You want to learn everything about everything.	Ushaka kwiga byose kuri buri kintu.
He went.	Yagiye.
It was almost time.	Byari hafi igihe.
Have a nice day.	Yaba umunsi mwiza.
I know there is a lot to it.	Nzi ko hari byinshi kuri byo.
That there is nothing wrong.	Ko nta kibi.
I have a problem here.	Mfite ikibazo hano.
I wanted to know more.	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi.
What he said.	Ibintu yavuze.
It is not a very good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza cyane.
But the family is good.	Ariko umuryango ni mwiza.
Tell me that.	Mbwira ibyo.
He knew a lot of people.	Yari azi abantu benshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I didn't have time.	Ntabwo nari mfite umwanya.
You don't know what to do or what to do.	Ntabwo uzi icyo ukora cyangwa icyo ugomba gukora.
They were at home.	Bari murugo.
She is worried.	Afite impungenge.
What should we do today?	Tugomba gukora iki uyu munsi?
Anyone can beat anyone.	Umuntu wese arashobora gutsinda umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I didn't have one.	Ntabwo nari mfite.
More than one.	Kurenza umwe.
He just wanted to.	Yashakaga gusa.
You have to be lucky.	Ugomba kugira amahirwe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It looks bad.	Birasa nabi.
There are many, many outside.	Hano hari benshi, benshi hanze.
We have a lot to do today.	Dufite ibintu byinshi muri iki gihe.
Yes, it was a wonderful experience.	Nibyo, byari ibintu byiza cyane.
From here, you are alone.	Kuva hano, uri wenyine.
He has a lot to say.	Afite byinshi byo kuvuga.
But you have to go.	Ariko ugomba kugenda.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
I want to know what he knows.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo azi.
You did it right.	Wabikoze neza.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
But there was something he wanted.	Ariko hari icyo yashakaga.
I do not mean.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga.
That was a good reason.	Iyo yari impamvu nziza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
This is a good thing.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza.
I want my baby.	Ndashaka ko umwana wanjye.
He was a family.	Yari umuryango.
It would be nice to be home.	Byaba byiza kuba murugo.
He could have played very well.	Yashoboraga gukina neza cyane.
Only good things.	Ibintu byiza gusa.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
And he has problems.	Kandi afite ibibazo.
Very good, very good.	Nibyiza cyane, byiza cyane.
That’s not true, obviously.	Ntabwo ari ukuri, biragaragara.
From here it is better to go.	Kuva hano uri byiza kugenda.
He thought it was a good plan for me.	Yatekereje ko ari gahunda nziza kuri njye.
That's not what we have here.	Ntabwo aribyo dufite hano.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
We have to work hard.	Tugomba gukora cyane.
Maybe it would be better.	Ahari byaba byiza.
It's good to be here.	Nibyiza kuba hano.
Sometimes it is true.	Rimwe na rimwe ni ukuri.
He was now alone.	Ubu yari wenyine.
But he is a good young man.	Ariko ni umusore mwiza.
I'm going to help.	Ngiye gufasha.
It would be nice to go.	Byaba byiza ugiye.
He looked away quickly.	Yarebye kure vuba.
And it is not easy.	Kandi ntabwo byoroshye.
I don't think that's possible.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko bishoboka.
But he wanted to wait.	Ariko yashakaga gutegereza.
I think he did.	Ndatekereza ko yabikoze.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza cyane cyo gukora.
You know how it works.	Uzi uko akora.
My son needs a dog.	Umuhungu wanjye akeneye imbwa.
He thought my wife was smart.	Yatekereje ko umugore wanjye afite ubwenge.
No problem, really.	Nta kibazo, mubyukuri.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
Everything was fine and easy.	Ibintu byose byari byiza kandi byoroshye.
It’s not a walking party.	Ntabwo ari ibirori byo kugenda.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
I am a teacher.	Ndi umwarimu.
You know where he is.	Uzi aho ari.
That's right.	Nukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu kimwe gusa.

I need to know more.	Nkeneye kumenya byinshi.
And he wanted more.	Kandi yashakaga byinshi.
But, there is something about it.	Ariko, hari ikintu kuri yo.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Really good to see.	Nibyiza rwose kubona.
She says she has a son.	Avuga ko afite umuhungu.
This is a bad idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo kibi.
Especially since.	Cyane cyane kuva.
Nothing, and never.	Nta na kimwe, kandi nta na rimwe.
He wanted to know where he was.	Yashakaga kumenya aho ari.
People.	Abantu.
I'm not easy.	Ntabwo ndi ibintu byoroshye.
I am a girl.	Ndi umukobwa.
I like to play	Nkunda gukina
I have to talk to you	Ngomba kuvugana nawe
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
He has to be better than he used to be.	Agomba kuba mwiza kuruta uko yahoze mbere.
I think he has to be good.	Ndatekereza ko agomba kuba mwiza.
Increase distance.	Kongera kure.
I can't wait to get out of here	Sinshobora gutegereza kuva hano
I can't figure out why	Sinshobora kumenya impamvu
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
I mean, really, really good	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose
This is his favorite.	Uyu niwe akunda.
I needed to hear something	Nari nkeneye kumva ikintu
But it was so beautiful.	Ariko yari mwiza cyane.
I wanted to be bad at home	Nashakaga kuba mubi murugo
Tell me what you know.	Mbwira ibyo uzi.
I can't figure out what it is	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya icyo aricyo
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri ibyo
He can come back any day.	Ashobora gutaha umunsi uwo ari wo wose.
It's too high.	Ni hejuru cyane.
You can do it again.	Urashobora kongera kubikora.
Short time to do what he has to do	Igihe gito cyo gukora ibyo agomba
He was not going to do anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari agiye gukora.
You have to have friends.	Ugomba kugira inshuti.
I should have been scared.	Nari nkwiye kugira ubwoba.
Now everyone is scared.	Ubu bose bafite ubwoba.
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose
That's good right now.	Nibyiza kuri ubu.
He has nothing to do.	Nta kintu na kimwe afite cyo gukora.
That's right, one by one.	Nibyo, umwe umwe.
He was not alone.	Ntiyari wenyine.
I need to find something	Nkeneye kubona ikintu
I thought a lot about your needs	Natekerezaga cyane kubyo ukeneye
I don’t want to say that for sure	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga neza ko aribyo
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
I was out here.	Nari hanze aha.
It will be a player.	Bizaba umukinnyi.
I thought it was easy	Natekereje ko byoroshye
He says it was just an opportunity.	Avuga ko byari amahirwe gusa.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
Lots of cars.	Imodoka nyinshi.
At the time, I didn't know much	Icyo gihe sinari nzi neza
You were just.	Wari gusa.
What do you think we should do?	Utekereza ko tugomba gukora iki?.
He had a lot to think about.	Yari afite byinshi byo gutekereza.
This is exactly what happened.	Buri gihe ni ko byagenze.
We have to.	Tugomba.
I would take one of those.	Nari gufata kimwe muri byo.
I can read people well	Nshobora gusoma abantu neza
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
I know he is not.	Nzi ko atari we.
I didn’t want to know more	Sinifuzaga kumenya byinshi
I have not received any money since	Kuva icyo gihe ntabwo nigeze mbona amafaranga
It seems.	Birasa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I think so too.	Nanjye ndatekereza.
I'm going to be here	Ngiye kuba hano
It is best to work alone.	Nibyiza cyane gukora wenyine.
This is a lot.	Ibi ni byinshi.
It's the same with talking.	Ni kimwe no kuvuga.
Tomorrow would be better.	Ejo byaba byiza.
Or not.	Cyangwa sibyo.
I'm not sure now.	Ntabwo nzi neza ubu.
For one thing.	Ku kintu kimwe.
He knew exactly what to do.	Yari azi neza icyo gukora.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo gito.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I just know where you are	Nzi gusa aho uri
Today was easy.	Uyu munsi byari byoroshye.
Nothing too bad.	Nta kintu kibi cyane.
I only have one thing to study now	Mfite ikintu kimwe gusa cyo kwiga ubu
That's good!	Nibyiza!.
He is the only one.	Niwe wenyine.
He later left the film	Nyuma yaje kuva muri firime
This is a good thing for me.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza kuri njye.
I was not sure what to do now	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora ubu
I saw something else	Nabonye ikindi kintu
I don't like it now	Ntabwo nkunda ubu
And obviously his father never did.	Kandi biragaragara ko na se atigeze abikora.
Let go of everything.	Kureka ibintu byose.
I understand why.	Numva impamvu.
The two of them had that.	Aba bombi bari bafite ibyo.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
A smart guy, a good guy.	Umusore uzi ubwenge, umusore mwiza.
She just looked at the baby.	Yarebye gusa umwana.
Let's go upstairs.	Ni hejuru.
He said it was a good idea.	Yavuze ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I want to leave here	Ndashaka kuva hano
Just for me.	Kuri njye gusa.
I was a child	Nari umwana
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But, it is.	Ariko, ni.
I can be good to her now.	Nshobora kuba mwiza kuri we ubu.
But I don’t want to stay.	Ariko ntashaka kuguma.
I really needed help	Nari nkeneye ubufasha rwose
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi.
I feel very fortunate that it went well	Ndumva mfite amahirwe cyane byagenze neza
I was not sure what he was doing right now	Sinari nzi neza icyo yakoze ubu
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I can't be alone	Sinshobora kuba wenyine
I used to be her and soon she will be me.	Nigeze kuba we kandi vuba aha azaba njye.
He did not know what to expect.	Ntiyari azi icyo yiteze.
What do you want	Ni iki ushaka.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
That was close.	Ibyo byari hafi.
I should have worked harder	Nari nkwiye gukora cyane
You know what you look like.	Uzi uko usa.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
I can't wait for tomorrow	Sinshobora gutegereza ejo
But if not.	Ariko niba atari byo.
He said he was beautiful, and intelligent.	Yavuze ko yari mwiza, kandi ufite ubwenge.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
And he is right.	Kandi afite ukuri.
At the time, I knew what he was doing	Icyo gihe nari nzi icyo arimo gukora
Not really.	Ntabwo ari mubyukuri.
I was just young, but it was easy	Nari muto gusa, ariko byari byoroshye
I don’t even want to do this.	Ntashaka no gukora ibi.
I hope he does it soon	Ndizera ko azabikora vuba
It is not a chance.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe.
I was a good guy.	Nari umusore mwiza.
He just loved it.	Yakundaga gusa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That was later.	Ibyo byari nyuma.
I did.	Nakoze.
Out here	Hanze aha.
I thought about what he said	Natekereje ku byo yavuze
I'm glad you did	Nishimiye ko wabikoze
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I had nothing to do	Nta kintu na kimwe nari mfite cyo gukora
They were not children.	Ntabwo bari abana.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
I was very close.	Nari hafi cyane.
He said he was.	Yavuze ko yari.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kubona aho.
I am doing what he wants	Ndimo nkora ibyo ashaka
You know things.	Uzi ibintu.
I was just thinking	Natekerezaga gusa
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
I love money.	Nkunda amafaranga.
It was great for me.	Byari byiza cyane kuri njye.
You think you have problems.	Utekereza ko ufite ibibazo.
I can't even live	Ntabwo nshobora no kubaho
My schedule is not very good.	Gahunda yanjye ntabwo ari nziza cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
In any case, no one was present at the time.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta muntu wari uri muri iki gihe.
I never wanted children	Sinigeze nshaka abana
I wonder if he has anything else	Ndabaza niba hari ikindi afite
We can't stay here.	Ntidushobora kuguma hano.
I hope she is not home now	Nizere ko ubu atari murugo
Probably not a friend.	Birashoboka ko atari inshuti.
Or formerly.	Cyangwa yahoze.
We have everything here.	Dufite ibintu byose hano.
I have to be very careful about this	Ngomba kuba ntekereza cyane kuri ibi
And he can stay there.	Kandi arashobora kuguma aho.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I thought he might be thinking of leaving	Natekereje ko ashobora gutekereza kugenda
I work inside.	Nkora imbere.
He will never do what he wants.	Ntazigera agira ibyo ashaka.
That's what he said.	Nibyo yavuze.
I want to stay home and read	Ndashaka kuguma murugo no gusoma
I have nothing to say	Ntacyo nshobora kuvuga
This is the basement.	Iyi ni yo nzu yo hasi.
But he knew nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yari azi.
Favorite teacher.	Umwarimu ukunda.
You can't even imagine.	Ntushobora gutekereza mbere.
I want to stay together	Ndashaka kuguma hamwe
I knew he was right, too	Nari nzi ko na we yari afite ukuri
I didn't have to go	Sinari nkwiye kugenda
I needed to be with him	Nari nkeneye kubana na we
A gift for what he would do	Impano kubyo yari gukora
he says.	avuga.
I was very far away	Nari kure cyane
He was young.	Yari akiri muto.
It's not that hard.	Ntabwo rwose bigoye.
He has a place.	Umwanya afite.
And really food for thought.	Kandi rwose ibiryo byo gutekereza.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
I wasn't sure if you were here before	Sinari nzi neza niba wari hano mbere
I thought about the house	Natekereje ku nzu
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.	Birashoboka ko yabonye ikintu atagomba kugira.
I have nothing to say.	Ntacyo nshobora kuvuga.
Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko ni byiza.
But one has to do it.	Ariko umuntu agomba kubikora.
Even today, he did not know exactly why.	No muri iki gihe, ntabwo yari azi neza impamvu.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Se.	Se.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I have enough of that.	Mfite ibyo bihagije.
It's best if you have to go.	Nibyiza niba ugomba kugenda.
Tell me what you like to eat.	Mbwira ibyo ukunda kurya.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
I am the only one	Ninjye muntu wenyine
I thought I was very lucky	Natekerezaga ko mfite amahirwe menshi
He knew who he was.	Yari azi uwo ari we.
Quit.	Kureka.
I'm glad you're here!	Nishimiye ko uri hano!
But he says nothing.	Ariko ntacyo avuga.
He didn't want anything.	Nta na kimwe yashakaga.
I hope you are on something here	Nizera ko uri ku kintu hano
Easy to read.	Gusoma byoroshye.
I was not sure of one of them	Sinari nzi neza kimwe muri byo
I guess you saw it	Ndakeka ko wabonye
He was not ready.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye.
It will be.	Bizaba.
I'm here with you now	Ndi hano, hamwe nawe ubu
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva byari hejuru cyane.
No one has a problem.	Nta muntu ufite ikibazo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I know everything.	Nzi ibintu byose.
I didn't think about that	Ntabwo natekereje kuri ibyo
I think it's a good thing	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
We can't take a lot of chances.	Ntidushobora gufata amahirwe menshi.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
Most of the time, he didn't say anything.	Igihe kinini, ntacyo yavuze.
I needed to do something.	Nari nkeneye gukora ikintu.
I have something to do tonight	Mfite icyo gukora muri iri joro
I meant to catch	Nashakaga kuvuga gufata
At the time, I didn't know much	Icyo gihe sinari nzi neza
I love women so much	Nkunda umugore cyane
I need to do that	Nkeneye kubikora gutya
He seemed scared.	Asa naho yari afite ubwoba.
But none of that did.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo yakoze.
I can't wait to learn everything	Sinshobora gutegereza kwiga byose
He was not sure what to do next.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo gukora nyuma.
No one knew where he was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho ari.
And you have to do it.	Kandi ugomba kubikora.
I was not.	Ntabwo nari.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.

Tell me that.	Mbwira ibyo.
He has a party.	Afite ibirori.
We have this.	Dufite ibi.
You did it.	Wabikoze.

He doesn't like anyone.	Ntabwo akunda umuntu uwo ari we wese.
This is here.	Ibi ni hano.
They knew what they were up to.	Bari bazi icyo bari cyo.
I wonder what else he knows.	Ndabaza ikindi azi.
The baby started eating a lot.	Umwana yatangiye kurya cyane.
I want to do it all with you	Ndashaka kubikora byose hamwe nawe

And it’s not just one thing.	Kandi ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe gusa.

It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
Lots of questions	Ibibazo byinshi
It's you.	Ndi wowe.
This is my family.	Uyu ni umuryango wanjye.
I wanted the same thing	Nashakaga ikintu kimwe
I'm sure he did	Nzi neza ko yabikoze
I know that for many, it is not	Nzi ko kuri benshi, sibyo
There are many reasons.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi.
I don't know what it is	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo
I don’t think we should help the same.	Ntabwo mbona ko tugomba gufasha kimwe.

I was not going to live that way	Ntabwo nari ngiye kubaho gutya
I know exactly where it is.	Nzi neza aho ari.
Not for long, though.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire, ariko.
I knew he was scared	Nari nzi ko afite ubwoba
Above all and nothing.	Hejuru ya byose kandi ntacyo.
We have to think about the plan.	Tugomba gutekereza kuri gahunda.
I know he didn't.	Nzi ko atabikoze.
Since then	Kuva icyo gihe.
I didn’t want to go back	Sinifuzaga gusubira inyuma
I needed to talk to you	Nari nkeneye kuvugana nawe
He had the truth to want to know everything.	Yari afite ukuri gushaka kumenya byose.
It's not down.	Ntabwo ari hasi.
She enjoyed being together.	Yishimiye kuba hamwe.
It was a sight to behold.	Byari ibintu byo kubona.
I can't say better than that	Ntabwo nshobora kuvuga neza kurenza ibyo
I think about what you want to hear	Ntekereza kubyo ushaka kumva
A gift.	Impano.

And, you're beautiful.	Kandi, uri mwiza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I thought it was all my fault	Natekereje ko byose ari amakosa yanjye
There is something about this.	Hariho ikintu kuri ibi.
I like to be scared.	Nkunda kugira ubwoba.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu ni byiza cyane.
But no action.	Ariko nta gukora.
I don't know if that's the case.	Sinzi niba aribyo.
But everything went wrong.	Ariko ibintu byose byagenze nabi.
We have a guy.	Dufite umusore.
He was not here.	Ntiyari hano.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
Or your time, today.	Cyangwa umwanya wawe, uyumunsi.
Something about being a woman.	Ikintu cyo kuba umugore.
I finally found something to do	Amaherezo nabonye ikintu cyo gukora
He just thought.	Yatekereje gusa.
I didn’t want to be alone	Sinifuzaga kuba wenyine
There is something for everyone.	Hariho ikintu kuri buri muntu.
You haven't seen much of it.	Ntabwo wabonye byinshi muri byo.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Sinzi icyo gukora, mubyukuri.
I can't look behind me.	Sinshobora kureba inyuma yanjye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
What I did.	Ibyo nakoze.
Everything you think is true.	Ibintu byose utekereza nukuri.
I have to stop that	Ngomba guhagarika ibyo
The first question.	Ikibazo cya mbere.
You always know what to do.	Buri gihe wigeze kumenya icyo gukora.
He must.	Agomba.
He has something for us.	Afite ikintu kuri twe.
I can do a lot of good things.	Nshobora gukora byinshi byiza.
I don't know what the problem is	Ntabwo nzi ikibazo icyo ari cyo
I want to do it now	Ndashaka kubikora ubu
I feel like I have it now.	Ndumva mfite ubu.
I wanted him to do it.	Nashakaga ko abikora.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
I was thinking a lot	Nari natekereje cyane
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kugenda
I mean, maybe he’s close here	Ndashaka kuvuga, birashoboka ko ari hafi hano
I have no way of knowing.	Ntabwo mfite uburyo bwo kumenya.
He could not have what he wanted.	Ibyo yashakaga ntabwo yashoboraga kugira.
I could never do that	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kubikora
We can't be together.	Ntidushobora kuba hamwe.
Maybe this is it.	Ahari ibi nibyo.
I was close to your age	Nari hafi imyaka yawe
People are scared.	Abantu bafite ubwoba.
I need to know what you are	Ngomba kumenya icyo uri cyo
I want you to think about this	Ndashaka ko utekereza kuri ibi
I know you are, obviously you are	Nzi ko uri, biragaragara ko uri
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
He knew what he wanted.	Yari azi icyo ashaka.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I feel lonely	Ndumva ndi wenyine
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.
He must know for sure.	Agomba kumenya neza.
I want to see something soon	Ndashaka kubona ikintu vuba aha
You have to work alone.	Ugomba gukora akazi wenyine.
The problem is that we need to do it better.	Ikibazo nuko dukeneye kubikora neza.
But everything went well.	Ariko ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I had a school.	Nari mfite ishuri.
I don't know if that's the case.	Sinzi niba aribyo.
I had nothing	Ntacyo nari mfite
I thought it was high	Natekereje ko byari hejuru
I have a little work to do tonight	Mfite akazi gato ko gukora iri joro
It is not his wife, nor his children, that I am.	Ntabwo ari umugore we, cyangwa abana be, ni njye.
And he knew something else.	Kandi yari azi ikindi kintu.
I want to be with her all the time	Ndashaka kubana na we igihe cyose

I didn't want to see this	Sinifuzaga kubona ibi
I think they are right	Ntekereza ko bafite ukuri
Everything in this room.	Ibintu byose muri iki cyumba.
I think it was close	Ntekereza ko byari hafi
Close, but not right.	Hafi, ariko sibyo.
I can't tell you which one.	Sinshobora kubwira kimwe muri byo.
He was dressed.	Yari yambaye.
I don’t think he has anyone outside.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko afite umuntu hanze.
And it was high.	Kandi byari hejuru.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
Can't drive or read, really bad.	Ntashobora gutwara imodoka cyangwa gusoma, mubi rwose.
I don't want to go out now.	Sinshaka kujya hanze ubu.
I don't know where the family is	Ntabwo nzi aho umuryango uri
I thought it would be nice	Natekereje ko byaba byiza
I know someone who can help	Nzi umuntu ushobora gufasha
You would not eat.	Ntabwo wari kurya.
There is something else.	Hari ikindi kintu.
I think he should be working	Ntekereza ko agomba kuba akora
Whatever you want.	Ibyo aribyo byose urashaka.
I wasn't sure if it was there.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza ko ahari.
Now there is no waiting at all.	Ubu nta gutegereza na gato.
I didn’t get a chance to watch	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kureba
He understands things.	Yumva ibintu.
I don't want to stop.	Sinshaka guhagarika.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu uyu munsi wari mwiza.
Very good, very easy.	Nibyiza cyane, byoroshye rwose.
I didn't hear anything	Nta na kimwe numvise
I like the idea well	Nkunda igitekerezo neza
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
No one has the opportunity to do that.	Nta muntu n'umwe ufite amahirwe yo kubikora.
I had a lot to do yesterday	Nari mfite byinshi byo gukora ejo
It was recently.	Byari vuba aha.
I was not sure what that was, but it was true.	Sinari nzi neza icyo, ariko byari ukuri.
He also spoke in advance.	Yavuze kandi imbere.
Well, a lot of things.	Nibyiza, ibintu byinshi.
Finding a home.	Kubona inzu.
Down, people.	Hasi, abantu.
We have to wait a long time.	Tugomba gutegereza igihe kirekire.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
My hair was bad that day.	Uwo munsi umusatsi wanjye wari mubi.
It was a great plan.	Byari gahunda nziza.
'	'
I think you can do good things	Ntekereza ko ushobora gukora ibintu byiza
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
We really are.	Turi rwose.
If you know anything, tell me.	Niba hari icyo uzi, mbwira.
And if he is, he is wise.	Niba kandi ari, afite ubwenge.
I don’t know why he wanted a baby	Sinzi impamvu yashakaga umwana
You know you have it.	Uzi neza ko ufite.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
I saw nothing wrong.	Ntacyo nabonye kibi.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
I'm glad to go but I'm not sure why	Nishimiye kugenda ariko sinzi neza impamvu
Maybe you have too.	Birashoboka ko nawe ufite.
However, this is not always the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo buri gihe.
I had a problem	Nari mfite ikibazo
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He got it enough.	Yabonye bihagije.
Looks like you're close.	Birasa nkaho uri hafi.
I think they were just scared	Ntekereza ko bari bafite ubwoba gusa
I was good friends at the time.	Icyo gihe nari inshuti nziza bombi.
He did it very well.	Yabikoze neza cyane.
That's not what you want.	Ntabwo aribyo ushaka.
I was then.	Icyo gihe nari.
This is not much.	Ibi ntabwo ari byinshi.
I like to try everything	Nkunda kugerageza byose
It was up to me.	Byari kuri njye.
Nothing, nothing.	Ntacyo, ntacyo.
I'm worried about him	Mfite impungenge kuri we
I am doing things.	Ndimo gukora ibintu.
I want to stay here for a while	Ndashaka kuguma hano igihe gito
No one knew what he was talking about.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo avuga.
For me, it was just a house. 	Kuri njye, yari inzu gusa. 
Most of it, in fact.	Byinshi muri byo, mubyukuri.
I knew the truth.	Nari nzi ukuri.
You can't do anything else.	Ntushobora gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari murugo.
I saw something	Nabonye ikintu
I don’t think anyone knew it existed	Ntabwo ntekereza ko hari umuntu wari uzi ko ahari
He took the time.	Yafashe umwanya.
I have to go back now	Ngomba gusubira inyuma ubu
See you later !.	Kubona nyuma!.
I didn't want this	Ntabwo nashakaga ibi
I can do everything	Nshobora gukora ibintu byose
Here it is.	Hano ari.
I was in him, from top to bottom	Nari muri we, kuva hejuru kugeza hasi
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
That was the plan.	Iyo yari gahunda.
She likes to go.	Akunda kugenda.
It was my fault.	Byari amakosa yanjye.
I can't see what it is	Sinshobora kubona icyo aricyo
I knew things would get better	Nari nzi ko ibintu byari kuba byiza
You are a good person.	Uri umuntu mwiza.
He wanted more.	Yashakaga byinshi.
I am right.	Ndi ukuri.
My son was gone.	Umwana wanjye yari yagiye.
He was younger than her.	Yari muto kuri we.
Sometimes he thought.	Rimwe na rimwe yatekerezaga.
She only wanted her hair.	Yashakaga gusa umusatsi we.
It was not his idea.	Ntabwo yari igitekerezo cye.
Things will be better than ever.	Ibintu bizaba byiza kuruta mbere.
I always wanted to work	Buri gihe nashakaga gukora
I really need to have this	Nkeneye rwose kugira ibi
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko aricyo kibazo cye.
After a while.	Nyuma ya gato.
They are at home, most likely they are out.	Bari murugo, birashoboka cyane ko bari hanze.
By now he knew how to do it.	Kugeza ubu yari azi kubikora.
He was not going.	Ntabwo yari agiye.
I know he wants to go home.	Nzi ko ashaka gutaha.
I think we can beat anyone	Ntekereza ko dushobora gutsinda umuntu uwo ari we wese
I hope he knew something	Ndizera ko hari icyo yari azi
There is only one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gusa.
We needed to get back here	Twari dukeneye gusubira hano
I knew what was going on, at the time	Nari nzi uko byagenze, icyo gihe
I knew he wanted to come	Nari nzi ko ashaka kuza
But his daughter was no longer a young girl.	Ariko umukobwa we ntiyari akiri umukobwa muto.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
I want what he has	Ndashaka icyo arimo
He loved to play.	Yakundaga gukina.
After all.	Buri nyuma.
All right.	Bose, neza.
It looks exactly right.	Birasa neza sibyo.
I didn’t want to work	Sinifuzaga gukora
I didn't know it existed	Sinari nzi ko ahari
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I thought for a moment	Natekereje gato
I needed to talk to you	Nari nkeneye kuvugana nawe
He thought enough.	Yatekereje bihagije.
He went.	Yagiye.
I didn't know what he meant	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
Just one thing, it is possible.	Ikintu gusa, birashoboka.
You are not sure what to think.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo utekereza.
But far from it.	Ariko kure cyane.
It looks good	Birasa neza
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
Ngomba.	Ngomba.
I have nothing to say on this matter	Ntacyo mfite cyo kuvuga kuri iki kibazo
I thought about it	Natekereje kuri iki kibazo
But no one was ready.	Ariko nta n'umwe yari yiteguye.
And there is a reason for that.	Kandi hariho impamvu i 'ibyo.
This is not possible, this is true.	Ibi ntabwo bishoboka, ibi nukuri.
I am so happy to be here.	Nishimiye cyane kuba hano.
And you know for sure.	Kandi uzi neza ko aribyo rwose.
I just wanted to.	Nashakaga gusa.
I hope so.	Nizera ko aribyo.
You can work hard.	Urashobora gukora cyane.
I just didn’t know exactly where	Gusa sinari nzi neza aho
That's right.	Nibyo.
Near the first.	Hafi ya mbere.
Bose.	Bose.
You just did it.	Wabikoze gusa.
This was a house, once.	Iyi yari inzu, rimwe.
We need to know where we are.	Tugomba kumenya aho turi.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
Only.	Gusa.
Ready to play.	Yiteguye gukina.
He did.	Yabikoze.
It's really good.	Mubyukuri nibyiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I'm not a bad guy here	Ntabwo ndi umusore mubi hano
It was a meeting yesterday.	Byari inama ejo.
But he is right.	Ariko afite ukuri.
I can't talk to anyone.	Ntabwo nshobora kuvugana numuntu.
This is not me.	Uyu ntabwo ari njye.
He has a plan.	Afite gahunda.
I know what you need most	Nzi icyo ukeneye cyane
He didn't have to say.	Ntabwo yagombaga kuvuga.
I am very happy with this.	Nishimiye cyane iki kintu.
When he was my age, he looked just like me.	Igihe yari afite imyaka yanjye, yasaga nkanjye.
Alone, nothing.	We wenyine, nta kintu na kimwe.
I thought about time	Natekereje igihe
I was above all	Nari hejuru ya byose
I'm glad he's here.	Nishimiye ko ari hano.
I knew exactly what to do	Nari nzi neza icyo gukora
I mean, we really can't do this	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri ntidushobora gukora ibi
Everything you say is true.	Ibyo ushaka kuvuga byose mubyukuri.
I didn't see much of a problem	Ntabwo nabonye ikibazo kinini
You don't have to.	Ntugomba.
In fact, you can.	Mubyukuri, urashobora.
But, here.	Ariko, hano.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
He must succeed.	Agomba gutsinda neza.
There is always so much.	Buri gihe hariho byinshi.
You have to feel good about yourself.	Ugomba kumva ko usa neza.
I was embarrassed and scared	Nagize isoni kandi mfite ubwoba
It is not an idea at all.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose.
I have to go back to work.	Ngomba gusubira ku kazi.
You have me '.	Ufite njye '.
I ask anyone.	Ndabaza umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
And more.	Kandi ikindi.
He came close.	Yaje hafi.
I don't think so	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo
And all you have to do is do it.	Kandi ibyo ugomba byose kubikora gusa.
I do nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nkora.
He needed to take a closer look.	Yari akeneye kureba neza.
There is a problem.	Hariho ikibazo.
That was easy enough.	Ibyo byari byoroshye bihagije.
It started.	Yatangiye.
To live.	Kubaho.
I need to do something good	Nkeneye gukora ikintu cyiza
I can't figure this out	Sinshobora kumenya ibi
I just wanted things to be normal	Nashakaga gusa ko ibintu bisanzwe
This is a good idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo cyiza.
One day he wants to stay.	Umunsi umwe arashaka kuguma.
We have to win.	Tugomba gutsinda.
I mean, someone had to do it.	Ndashaka kuvuga, umuntu yagombaga kubikora.
I want a chance to play	Ndashaka amahirwe yo gukina
I never thought it would be possible	Sinari natekereje ko bishoboka
I just like to read.	Nkunda gusoma gusa.
Maybe for him.	Ahari kuri we.
For this, e.g.	Kuri iyi, nka.
He said he came here.	Yavuze ko hano yaje.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Sinzi neza niba aribyo.
I can't talk to you right now	Ntabwo nshobora kuvugana nawe nonaha
When he is good, he is good.	Iyo ari mwiza, aba ari mwiza.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
One could easily find what to do.	Umuntu yashoboraga kubona byoroshye gukora ibyo ashaka.
I really wanted to go	Nashakaga rwose kugenda
That's right for me.	Nukuri kuri njye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko mubyukuri dufite ibi byose inyuma.
I didn't know where you were	Sinari nzi aho uri
At the same time, it is not.	Mugihe kimwe, ntabwo mubyukuri.
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
It was a privilege.	Byari amahirwe.
I was not in the room.	Sinari mu cyumba.
He is not a young man.	Ntabwo ari umusore.
I have a nice house	Mfite inzu nziza
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
I was not lucky.	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe yo.
They had no money.	Ntabwo bari bafite amafaranga.
He did the same thing.	Yakoze ikintu kimwe.
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
That would be nice.	Ibyo byaba byiza.
He did not know everyone.	Ntabwo yari azi abantu bose.
This thing is good.	Iki kintu ni cyiza.
I wanted to try something else	Nashakaga kugerageza gukora ikindi kintu
And as usual, he didn't have much to ask for.	Kandi nkuko bisanzwe, ntabwo yari afite byinshi byo gusaba.
A lot of people are scared.	Abantu benshi bafite ubwoba.
It's better than that.	Nibyiza cyane kurenza ibyo.
He thinks he knows everything.	Yibwira ko azi byose.
I would just try	Nari kugerageza gusa
I have children.	Mfite abana.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
I'm not sure	Ntabwo nzi neza
I have a big problem with that	Mfite ikibazo kinini kuri ibyo
I feel like someone	Ndumva hariho umuntu
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I hope they did	Nizera ko bari kubikora
And you know what, it's good.	Kandi uzi icyo, nibyiza.
For him, that was good.	Kuri we, ibyo byari byiza.
You don't like it	Ntabwo ukunda.
This is a good thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza.
It is my privilege.	Ni amahirwe yanjye.
That's not what you think.	Ntabwo aribyo utekereza.
I didn't know how difficult it would be	Sinari nzi uburyo byari kuba bigoye
Cuba.	Kuba.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
Right now	Ubu nonaha.
I never saw this	Sinigeze mbona ibi
But now we are your family.	Ariko ubu turi umuryango wawe.
I wanted to leave	Nashakaga kuva aho
That's not what he needed.	Ntabwo aribyo yari akeneye.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
This was his son.	Uyu yari umuhungu we.
But obviously someone was scared.	Ariko biragaragara ko umuntu yagize ubwoba.
You can read more about me here.	Urashobora gusoma byinshi kuri njye hano.
He could have stayed away.	Yashoboraga kuguma kure.
That's right.	Nibyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
He used to be my friend.	Yahoze ari inshuti yanjye.
I know waiting is hard	Nzi ko gutegereza bigoye
But that’s not a bad thing.	Ariko ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
And he had.	Kandi yari afite.
I saw a woman.	Nabonye umugore.
I was looking for a house	Nashakaga inzu
I have to go to work soon	Ngomba kujya ku kazi vuba
I saw it all	Nabonye byose
If not.	Niba atari byo.
I'm not sure what to do.	Sinzi neza icyo gukora.
This is it.	Ubu ni bwo.
And he was there.	Kandi yari ahari.
Everything.	Byose.
He always seemed to plan what I wanted.	Buri gihe yasaga nkaho ateganya ibyo nshaka.
At the time, I didn't think much of it	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga cyane
You're going to do something.	Ugiye gukora ikintu na kimwe.
He knew where.	Yari azi aho.
I had a job to do	Nari mfite akazi ko gukora
I have a lot of time	Mfite igihe kinini
This is also true.	Ibi kandi ni ukuri.
It's not like me.	Ntabwo ari nkanjye.
For him.	Kuri we.
I think we only need one	Ntekereza ko dukeneye umwe gusa
I knew then.	Icyo gihe nari nzi.
I can't do it right now.	Sinshobora gukora iki gihe.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
I'm so sorry for that	Mbabajwe cyane nibyo byose
You got a job, so far.	Wabonye akazi, kugeza ubu.
He thought I wanted to go home.	Yatekereje ko nshaka gutaha.
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
I didn’t need it recently	Ntabwo nari nkeneye vuba aha
He wants to have.	Yifuza kugira.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekereje.
I want to talk to you first	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe ikintu cya mbere
I don't think so	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo
I thought it was great.	Natekereje ko byari byiza cyane.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga kure
You don't have to.	Ntugomba.
I can do something	Nshobora kugira icyo nkora
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
He was obviously lucky.	Biragaragara ko yari afite amahirwe.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
I haven't heard much	Sinigeze numva byinshi
I didn’t want to see a dog	Sinifuzaga kubona imbwa
I am not a single player.	Ntabwo ndi umukinnyi umwe.
I was the only guy	Nari umusore wenyine
Before taking his place.	Mbere yo gufata umwanya we.
I think that would be great	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza cyane
He may not have it.	Ashobora kuba adafite.
And in fact.	Kandi mubyukuri.
Or very much.	Cyangwa cyane.
I wonder where he is now	Ndabaza aho ari ubu
I was here before.	Nari hano mbere.
It is and is not.	Ari kandi ntabwo aribyo.
At that time I did not know	Icyo gihe sinari nzi
He was not far away.	Ntabwo yari kure.
You bad	Wowe mubi.
I enjoyed everything	Nishimiye ibintu byose
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Mfite byinshi byo gukora ejo
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
He knows what.	Niwe uzi icyo.
You can help people find the right car.	Urashobora gufasha abantu kubona imodoka nziza.
I would be very embarrassed	Nari kugira isoni cyane
I can't say what it is	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo aricyo
It would be nice for us.	Byaba byiza kuri twe.
Many, in fact.	Benshi, mubyukuri.
There is no going back now.	Nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
It's really good here.	Nibyiza rwose hano.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, ntugomba kubikora.
He has a lot to do.	Afite byinshi byo gukora.
Down and up.	Hasi no hejuru.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
Ninde.	Ninde.
I never told anyone	Ntabwo nigeze mbwira umuntu uwo ari we wese
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
Everything is normal and very good.	Byose bisanzwe kandi byiza cyane.
Well, at least you didn't go down without explaining yourself first.	Nibyiza, ugomba kuba umugore icyo gihe.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
I never heard him speak	Sinigeze numva ibyo avuga
I should have said he had	Nari nkwiye kuvuga ko yari afite
I never saw him want something so much	Sinigeze mbona ashaka ikintu cyane
I didn't think it would be difficult	Sinatekerezaga ko bizaba bigoye
I never did much	Ntabwo nigeze nkora ikintu kinini
I wouldn't do it	Ntabwo nari kubikora
Yari.	Yari.
Please, that's fine.	Nyamuneka, nibyiza.
In fact, today it looked very good.	Mubyukuri, uyu munsi yasaga neza neza.
I think that was the reason	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari impamvu
He was young at the time.	Icyo gihe yari akiri muto.
I wanted to go to school	Nashakaga kujya ku ishuri
I guess it's the same for him	Ndakeka ko ari kimwe kuri we
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
We had a plan.	Twari dufite gahunda.
I have time.	Mfite umwanya.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He made a mistake.	Yakoze amakosa.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I was not behind him	Ntabwo nari inyuma ye
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
And there are things we can do.	Kandi hariho ibintu dushobora gukora.
The space was short.	Umwanya wari muto.
I have the opportunity to live	Mfite amahirwe yo kubaho
I was really embarrassed	Nagize isoni rwose
This is my house.	Iyi ni inzu yanjye.
I need to know what he said	Ngomba kumenya ibintu yavuze
I just had the opportunity to know when	Gusa nagize amahirwe yo kumenya igihe
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I didn't know you could do this.	Sinari nzi ko ushobora gukora ibi.
to ask.	gusaba.
I want to work.	Ndashaka gukora.
I needed to know what he wanted	Nari nkeneye kumenya icyo ashaka
I just need to be with you	Nkeneye gusa kubana nawe
I needed to hear that there was	Nari nkeneye kumva ko ahari
I saw that.	Nabonye ko.
Too bad to play.	Gukina nabi cyane.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
I'm glad you're here with me	Nishimiye ko uri hano hamwe nanjye
That's good.	Nibyiza.
If he is still here.	Niba akiri hano.
We are in one.	Turi muri umwe.
I want you to do exactly what you want	Ndashaka ko ukora neza icyo ushaka
He should have known better, in fact.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza, mubyukuri.
I was everything but, really	Nari ikintu cyose ariko, mubyukuri
I am not very happy to apply for a job	Ntabwo nishimiye cyane gusaba akazi
There is a catch.	Hariho gufata.
Never.	Nta na rimwe.
Only.	Gusa.
All of that was before he left.	Ibyo byose byari mbere yuko agenda.
I'm glad you're here	Nishimiye ko uri hano
That's exactly what faith does.	Nibyo rwose kwizera gukora.
I can't do it alone	Ntabwo nshobora gukora wenyine
I don't know who he is	Sinzi uwo ari we
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza cyane.
What he could do.	Ibyo yashoboraga gukora.
He knew better than to say anything.	Yari azi neza kuruta kugira icyo avuga.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
I want to do things right	Ndashaka gukora ibintu neza
He had not come to do things.	Ntabwo yari yaje gukora ibintu.
We are too.	Natwe turi.
I did not hear	Ntabwo numvise
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
The people in him.	Abantu bari muri we.
I can't say for sure	Ntabwo nshobora kuvuga neza
This was something he was really worried about.	Ibi byari ibintu rwose yari afite impungenge.
She would be a beautiful girl.	Yaba umukobwa mwiza.
It was good to go	Byari byiza kugenda
I didn’t want to talk about this	Sinifuzaga kuvuga kuri ibi
I didn't get a chance to live	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kubaho
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari bisanzwe kandi byiza cyane.
There will be more opportunities.	Hari amahirwe menshi azaba arimo.
We are just friends.	Turi inshuti gusa.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
I thought everything would be fine	Natekerezaga ko ibintu byose byari kuba byiza
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
I'm sure you saw it.	Nzi neza ko wabonye.

I really want him to be a good guy	Ndashaka cyane ko aba umusore mwiza
As if he were.	Nkaho yari.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
There is only one other thing.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe gusa.
Either way, if you are, you are.	Ibyo ari byo byose, niba uri, uri.
It was not good at all.	Ntabwo byari byiza rwose.
I saw exactly what he was saying.	Nabonye neza ibyo avuga.
Once upon a time	Wigeze.
It was a way of knowing.	Byari uburyo bwo kumenya.
I think he is young	Ntekereza ko ari muto
I got it right.	Nabonye neza.
Anything.	Ikintu cyose.
I can't wait any longer	Sinshobora gutegereza ikindi gihe
She didn't want to be together.	Ntabwo yashakaga kubana.
I'm leaving now	Ubu ngiye kugenda
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But, she was so beautiful.	Ariko, yari mwiza cyane.
I'm going to stay here	Ngiye kuguma hano
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
He knew what he wanted.	Yari azi icyo ashaka.
I am a girl.	Ndi umukobwa.
Each of us.	Buri wese muri twe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
I should have seen something.	Nari nkwiye kubona ikintu.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
You are seeing things.	Urimo kubona ibintu.
I'm looking for someone who can talk to me	Ndashaka umuntu ushobora kuvugana nanjye
I think he's just ashamed	Ntekereza ko afite isoni gusa
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
He was not well prepared for the first time.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye neza bwa mbere.
In fact today.	Mubyukuri iki gihe.
Apparently I'm not thinking right now.	Biragaragara ko ntatekereza neza muri iki gihe.
I'm sorry	Mbabajwe
I wanted nothing for him or anyone	Ntacyo nashakaga kuri we cyangwa ku muntu uwo ari we wese
Being human.	Kuba umuntu.
I am a very lucky boy.	Ndi umuhungu ufite amahirwe menshi.
I need to see more of it	Nkeneye kureba byinshi muri byo
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
You can't be her.	Ntushobora kuba we.
I can't do that.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora.
I shouldn't have been here	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuba hano
We are here to work.	Turi hano gukora.
He just went.	Yagiye gusa.
And it is not my fault.	Kandi ntabwo ari amakosa yanjye.
He could see nothing for her.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari kubona kuri we.
I really needed the money	Nari nkeneye rwose amafaranga
He was a good friend.	Yari inshuti nziza.
I think this whole thing is a good idea.	Ntekereza ko iki kintu cyose ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I had absolutely nothing	Ntacyo nari mfite rwose
It is one and the same.	Ni umwe kandi umwe.
I think a lot about going	Ntekereza cyane ku kugenda
He is a good dog.	Ni imbwa nziza.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
I didn't have it that morning	Ntabwo nari mfite muri icyo gitondo
I have been here ever since	Ndi hano kuva icyo gihe
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ntacyo ushobora gukora.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
We are on film.	Turi kuri firime.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi neza ko yabikoze.
I can't find the door	Sinshobora kubona umuryango
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
We have to get out of here.	Tugomba kuva hano.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
I did not know who his father was	Sinari nzi se uwo ari we
I think he is ahead of everyone	Ntekereza ko ari imbere muri bose
I have to be more.	Ngomba kuba byinshi.
I'm not sure why this was the case	Ntabwo nzi neza impamvu ibi byari
I think that's what it is.	Ntekereza ko aribyo aribyo.
He had nothing.	Ntacyo yari afite.
But all the time is short.	Ariko umwanya wose ni muto.
He never had a problem walking.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ikibazo cyo kugenda.
I never saw his car.	Sinigeze mbona imodoka ye.
I guess it was, like, a big deal	Ndakeka ko byari, nka, ikintu kinini
And you know what he said? 	Kandi uzi icyo yavuze?
.	.
You can't tell where you can hear something.	Ntushobora kumenya aho ushobora kumva ikintu.
I haven't seen it since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona
I didn't have to go	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugenda
He didn't need to think much.	Ntabwo yari akeneye gutekereza cyane.
I didn’t know when he would get it	Sinari nzi igihe yari kubona
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
And it was so beautiful.	Kandi yari nziza cyane.
I need help	Nkeneye ubufasha
But he was not worried.	Ariko ntabwo yari afite impungenge.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
I never wanted a place near me	Sinigeze nshaka aho ari hafi yanjye
You always do good things for everyone.	Buri gihe ukora ibintu byiza kuri buri wese.
He says he is going to school.	Avuga ko agiye ku ishuri.
If that's the case then I can't say.	Niba aribyo byiza ntashobora kuvuga.
You have to be friends.	Ugomba kuba inshuti.
I was not going to take the time	Ntabwo nari ngiye gufata umwanya
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
He said he would be involved.	Yavuze ko azaba arimo.
I want to trust people	Ndashaka kwizera abantu
You can't.	Ntushobora.
They didn't really have anything.	Ntabwo rwose bari bafite ikintu na kimwe.
He did not want his favorite job.	Ntiyashakaga akazi yakundaga.
It was a matter of waiting.	Byari ibintu byo gutegereza.
If not more.	Niba atari byinshi.
He is the right person.	Ni umuntu ukwiye.
Sometimes, it’s something you need to hear.	Rimwe na rimwe, ni ikintu ukeneye kumva.
For us.	Kuri twe.
There is more today.	Uyu munsi hari byinshi.
He was not ready.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
But he has none.	Ariko ntabwo afite.
He loved his house.	Yakundaga inzu ye.
I hope this is true	Ndizera ko ibi ari ukuri
I was not a very good person	Ntabwo nari umuntu mwiza cyane
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
Not that he had it before.	Ntabwo ari uko yari afite mbere.
I knew nothing about him	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi kuri we
I don't know why he did it.	Sinzi impamvu yabikoze.
But for me it is not.	Ariko kuri njye ntabwo aribyo.
At the moment he is just looking for things.	Kuri ubu yatekereje gushaka ibintu gusa.
He got it wrong.	Yabonye nabi.
I'm sure we have nothing to do with it	Nzi neza ko ntacyo dufite kuri kimwe
He had to be my friend.	Yagombaga kuba inshuti yanjye.
He thought I was here all the time	Yatekerezaga ko nari hano hano igihe cyose
You don't have to look far from me.	Ntugomba kureba kure yanjye.
I was in this room, and I didn't have to be	Nari muri iki cyumba, kandi sinari nkwiye kuba
At the time, I knew he was young	Icyo gihe nari nzi ko yari muto
What is the first.	Kinini ni kinini.
I can't think of anything else	Sinshobora gutekereza ikindi kintu
I don't want to think about anything.	Sinshaka gutekereza ku kintu na kimwe.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
Things were very difficult.	Ibintu byari bigoye cyane.
But not all people are gifted, obviously.	Ariko ntabwo abantu bose bafite impano, biragaragara.
I don't want it now	Sinshaka ubu
It’s not easy, but it’s definitely possible.	Ntabwo byoroshye, ariko birashoboka rwose.
I can't do that soon	Sinshobora kubikora vuba
The truth.	Ukuri.
I had the opportunity to be with you	Nagize amahirwe yo kubana nawe
And that’s not any idea.	Kandi ntabwo ari igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose.
I don’t believe he did what he looked like.	Ntabwo nizera ko yakoze ibyo asa nkaho yakoze.
That wasn't enough for me at the time.	Ntabwo byari bihagije kuri njye icyo gihe.
He chose to leave.	Yahisemo kugenda.
many.	benshi.
No one has ever heard of anything.	Nta muntu wigeze yumva ikintu na kimwe.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
No phone, no waiting.	Nta terefone, nta gutegereza.
This is really good.	Ibi rwose ni byiza.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
My first house.	Inzu yanjye ya mbere.
I don’t think he’s very good at that	Ndakeka ko atari mwiza cyane kuri byo
I'm going to look at what we can do	Ngiye kureba icyo dushobora gukora
He probably had to.	Birashoboka ko yagombaga.
I know what it is.	Nzi icyo aricyo.
He could see clearly now.	Yashoboraga kubona neza ubu.
You can see.	Ushobora kubona.
I need to go home a little	Nkeneye gutaha gato
I did, a lot.	Nakoze, byinshi.
He didn't know what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi, mubyukuri, icyo aricyo.
It would be easy.	Byaba byoroshye.
I found something though.	Nabonye ikintu ariko.
I would do it	Nari kubikora
He just took the first thing he saw.	Yafashe gusa ikintu cya mbere yabonye.
It's all.	Byose ni.
All of these are problems.	Ibyo byose ni ibibazo.
If you can tell.	Niba ushobora kuvuga.
You can do it.	Urashobora gukora.
Reading is not true.	Gusoma ntabwo ari ukuri.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
It was all.	Byari byose.
I didn't want anything	Nta na kimwe nashakaga
Why.	Impamvu.
I had a really bad day	Nagize umunsi mubi rwose
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
I never saw him look like that before	Sinigeze mbona ko asa mbere
He was the only child.	Yari umwana wenyine.
However, there was much to it.	Ariko, hari byinshi byari kuri yo.
But not today.	Ariko si uyu munsi.
I really want to be your friend	Ndashaka rwose kuba inshuti yawe
He wanted to win.	Yashakaga gutsinda.
I mean worse than usual	Ndashaka kuvuga nabi kuruta uko byari bisanzwe
I want to see if this is possible.	Ndashaka kureba niba bishoboka.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
I know exactly who you are	Nzi neza uwo uri we
If you are.	Niba uri.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
If not for you, better than me.	Niba atari wowe, kuruta kuri njye.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
I knew nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi
I can wait for tomorrow	Nshobora gutegereza ejo
Normally, he was scared.	Mu bisanzwe, yari afite ubwoba.
Recently.	Vuba aha.
Me too.	Nanjye.
And this is something.	Kandi iki ni ikintu.
Nothing here.	Nta kintu na kimwe hano.
I know what he is looking for	Nzi icyo arimo gushaka
I have to go early today	Ngomba kugenda kare uyu munsi
I saw a lot of him	Nabonye byinshi muri we
I did nothing wrong	Nta kibi nakoze
I feel really bad	Ndumva mubi rwose
He could eat.	Yashoboraga kurya.
She will be fine in a short time.	Azaba mwiza mugihe gito.
That is good.	Iyo ari byiza.
I shouldn’t have done that	Sinari nkwiye kubikora
Inside.	Imbere.
I had a lot to learn	Nari mfite byinshi byo kwiga
Anyway.	Icyo ari cyo cyose.
I wonder why he does it	Ndabaza impamvu abikora
He can't walk, he can't talk.	Ntashobora kugenda, ntashobora kuvuga.
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
A girl can't have everything	Umukobwa ntashobora kugira byose
I wanted to know things	Nashakaga kumenya ibintu
The whole family is doing well now.	Umuryango wose urimo gukora neza ubu.
It was me, just me.	Nari njye, gusa ni njye.
I think we should take the time	Ntekereza ko tugomba gufata umwanya
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
Money.	Amafaranga.
I want to say goodbye.	Ndashaka kuvuga neza.
Seeing that.	Kubona ibyo.
That's not really the case.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
He was in.	Yari arimo.
But he was not there.	Ariko ntiyari ahari.
Getting out of here.	Kubona kuva hano.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I could never do that	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kubikora
A very beautiful woman.	Umugore mwiza cyane.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
Or a boy.	Cyangwa umuhungu.
I don't mean to say	Sinshaka kuvuga
However, there is a catch.	Ariko, hariho gufata.
I noticed that you have problems	Nabonye ko ufite ibibazo
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
I didn’t know how good it was	Sinari nzi uburyo byari byiza
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I think he is one of them	Ndatekereza ko ari umwe muri
You were nearby.	Wari hafi aho.
But he is not doing well.	Ariko ntabwo agira neza.
I can't do it again	Sinshobora kongera kubikora
I did nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nakoze.
I was young at the time.	Icyo gihe nari muto.
I believe in the truth.	Nizera ukuri.
I need to pick up the phone.	Ngomba gufata terefone.
I want to talk about this.	Ndashaka kuvuga kuri ibi.
We have that.	Dufite iyo.
I guess so.	Ndakeka ko aribyo.
He thought he was far away.	Yatekereje ko ari kure.
I like to work alone	Nkunda gukora wenyine
But once a week or so, that will be fine.	Ariko rimwe mu cyumweru cyangwa hafi, ibyo bizaba byiza.
I have it all.	Mfite byose.
You have to do this.	Ugomba gukora ibi.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I was a good person	Nari umuntu mwiza
In fact, it's very good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza cyane.
Arimo.	Arimo.
I didn’t want to know people	Sinifuzaga kumenya abantu
I have to go back, he thought a lot.	Nkwiye gusubira inyuma, yatekereje cyane.
I'm not doing that	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
The man was three years old.	Uwo yari afite imyaka itatu.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose byari amahirwe.
But everything is possible.	Ariko byose birashoboka.
I heard a lot about him.	Numvise byinshi kuri we.
I have a lot to do first	Mfite byinshi byo gukora mbere
I didn't know they had it	Sinari nzi ko bafite
I can live with that, right now	Nshobora kubana nibyo, kuri ubu
We have too.	Natwe dufite.
I mean, that’s obvious	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibyo biragaragara
If not, nothing at all.	Niba atari byo, nta kintu na kimwe.
He is very young.	Ari muto cyane.
He thought all day	Yatekereje umunsi wose
I have never done anything wrong	Nta kintu kibi nigeze nkora
I didn't need any of that	Ntabwo nari nkeneye na kimwe muri byo
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I never saw or heard anything	Sinigeze mbona cyangwa numva na kimwe
Probably not even at the time.	Birashoboka ko atari no muri icyo gihe.
Obviously, you really want to be higher than the lower.	Biragaragara, rwose urashaka kuba hejuru kuruta hasi.
I really did.	Nakoze rwose.
I don't see any problem.	Ntabwo mbona ikibazo na kimwe.
You have no one.	Nta muntu ufite.
Easy and good.	Byoroshye kandi byiza.
I never heard him speak	Sinigeze numva avuga
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I guess we should see	Ndakeka ko tugomba kubona
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
I have to do it the way I want to.	Ngomba kubikora uko nshaka.
I think this is true.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari ukuri.
You love the one you love.	Ukunda uwo ukunda.
And he probably has the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
This is a great buy.	Ibi ni byiza cyane kugura.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
I was very young	Nari muto cyane
I acted as if they knew everything	Nakoze nkaho bazi byose
However, none.	Ariko, nta n'umwe.
It was a great plan.	Byari gahunda nziza.
He didn’t do good things.	Ntabwo yakoze ibintu byiza.
Luckily for him.	Amahirwe yagiye imbere ye.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
But you are a beautiful girl.	Ariko uri umukobwa mwiza.
They know where everyone is going.	Bazi aho buri wese agiye.
I can't think straight	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza neza
Getting one child.	Kubona umwana umwe.
And he never did anything later	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora nyuma
He thought he was like him.	Yatekerezaga ko ari nka we.
Sometimes, you can't do that.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntushobora kubikora.
I think this was a mistake	Ntekereza ko ibi byari amakosa
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi.
I don't know why they would do this	Sinzi impamvu bari gukora ibi
I did not know who he was at the time.	Sinari nzi uwo ari we icyo gihe.
Far and wide.	Kure kure.
I work hard.	Nkora cyane.
He used to do it.	Yakundaga kubikora.
What he needs to hear.	Icyo agomba kumva.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
And that's not the only problem.	Kandi ntabwo ari ikibazo gusa.
I wanted to talk to him	Nashakaga kuvugana na we
Not very likely.	Ntabwo bishoboka cyane.
I understand everything	Ndumva byose
He says nothing.	Nta cyo avuga.
He is good at it.	Arimo kuba mwiza kuri byo.
You really don't have to talk to him like that.	Ntabwo rwose ugomba kuvugana nawe gutya.
If not, that's fine.	Niba atari byo, nibyiza.
One day at a time.	Umunsi umwe umwe.
Going to the snake.	Agiye ejo.
He told me that.	Yambwiye ibyo.
I understand what he meant	Ndumva icyo yashakaga kuvuga
There is not much time to eat.	Ntabwo hari igihe kinini cyo kurya.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
Just one.	Umwe gusa.
A lot of things are clear right now	Ibintu byinshi biragaragara neza ubu
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I can't go.	Sinshobora kujyana.
He has it all.	Afite byose.
Maybe you can.	Birashoboka ko ushobora.
We can't see anything.	Ntabwo dushobora kubona ikintu na kimwe.
This is something you have to do.	Iki kintu ugomba gukora.
He said he would do it.	Yavuze ko azabikora.
is.	ni.
I have school tomorrow	Mfite ishuri ejo
There is so much to see and do and hear.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona no gukora no kumva.
He is doing a lot of good things.	Arimo gukora byinshi byiza.
I was never able to walk	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kugenda
Now is your day.	Ubu ari munsi yawe.
I never wanted to do that.	Sinigeze nshaka kubikora.
You know where we should go.	Uzi aho tugomba kujya.
Money goes.	Amafaranga agenda.
I was here before	Nari hano mbere
Prison uniforms are prison uniforms.	Imyenda ya gereza ni imyenda ya gereza.
I really need to go now	Nkeneye rwose kugenda ubu
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
Either way let this be.	Ibyo ari byo byose reka reka ibi.
I just told someone that I was on the phone yesterday	Gusa nabwiye umuntu ko ejo kuri terefone
I want to go	Ndashaka kugenda
I'm really happy with what happened	Nishimiye rwose uko byagenze
We need a phone.	Dukeneye terefone.
I should have stayed on it.	Nari nkwiye kuguma kuri yo.
He had done nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yari yakoze.
He could have known when he did more.	Yashoboraga kumenya igihe yakoze byinshi.
I really need help.	Nkeneye cyane ubufasha.
I think you need food.	Ntekereza ko ukeneye ibiryo.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I can't hear anything, just	Ntacyo nshobora kumva, gusa
I had nothing here to wait for	Ntacyo nari mfite hano gutegereza
I want to hear good things.	Ndashaka kumva ibintu byiza.
I had a lot of money	Nari mfite amafaranga menshi
You can leave here.	Urashobora kuva hano.
I love people here	Nkunda abantu hano
And he did it quickly.	Kandi yabikoze vuba.
I'm afraid it's not too much	Mfite ubwoba ko atari byinshi
Whatever it was, it was what we needed.	Ibyo ari byo byose, byari ibyo twari dukeneye.
From here he could look outside early.	Kuva hano yashoboraga kureba hanze kuri kare.
I thought he was right	Natekereje ko yari afite ukuri
I just need him to hear.	Nkeneye gusa ko yumva.
I didn't deserve it	Ntabwo nari nkwiye
Yes, there are many.	Nibyo, hari byinshi.
It was not me.	Ntabwo yari njye.
I can't hear anything, see anything or hear anything	Ntabwo nshobora kumva ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose, kubona ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose cyangwa kumva ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
I would wait	Nari gutegereza
I just have a problem	Mfite ikibazo gusa
I had a problem	Nari mfite ikibazo
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
I don't know that.	Sinzi ibyo.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
I didn’t think that was possible	Sinatekerezaga ko ibyo bishoboka
He wanted her to live in him.	Yashakaga ko aba muri we.
I know you said you were looking for a job	Nzi ko wavuze ko ushaka akazi
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
There is something wonderful about it.	Hariho ikintu cyiza cyane.
He did not have to read again.	Ntabwo yagombaga kongera gusoma.
That's right.	Nibyo.
She was a girl.	Yari umukobwa.
More than food.	Kurenza ibiryo.
Eating well is good.	Kurya neza ibiryo nibyiza.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
You have it too.	Ufite nawe.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I didn't know how old he was then	Sinari nzi imyaka yari afite icyo gihe
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
This is one of us.	Ubu ni umwe muri twe.
I didn’t want to be in front of him again	Sinifuzaga kongera kuba imbere ye
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I thought about it a lot	Natekereje kuri byinshi
I just need to know what I see.	Nkeneye gusa kumenya icyo mbona.
I can't figure out why.	Sinshobora kumenya impamvu.
You have to go ahead.	Ugomba kujya imbere.
He really didn't need to tell anyone.	Ntabwo rwose yari akeneye kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Today I thought about a lot	Uyu munsi natekereje kuri byinshi
I was not sure what he had in store for me	Sinari nzi neza icyo yari afite kuri njye
He may be doing it wrong.	Ashobora kuba abikora nabi.
You have to work hard.	Ugomba gukora cyane.
This person is involved.	Uyu muntu arimo.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
Until this morning.	Kugeza muri iki gitondo.
That's a good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Very nice house.	Inzu nziza cyane.
Every day.	Buri munsi.
And money.	Kandi amafaranga.
And one is about to do it.	Kandi umuntu ari hafi kubikora.
It’s not a matter of adding	Ntabwo ari ikibazo cyo kongera
He began to stay away.	Yatangiye kuguma kure.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
Something big and good.	Ikintu kinini kandi cyiza.
I can't find anything on the phone	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya ikintu kuri terefone
I didn't know what time it was	Sinari nzi igihe icyo ari cyo
We need a way to do that, though.	Dukeneye uburyo bwo kubikora, ariko.
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki?.
I need to play smart	Nkeneye gukina ubwenge
I didn't know anyone	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nzi
I really didn't want to see or talk to anyone	Sinifuzaga rwose kubona cyangwa kuvugana numuntu
Everything he loved.	Ikintu cyose yakundaga.
And that is possible.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka.
The reason is, he did it before.	Impamvu kuba, yabikoze mbere.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I never liked it	Ntabwo nigeze nkunda
I wanted to know what he knew.	Nashakaga kumenya ibyo yari azi.
I knew this.	Nari nzi iyi.
I'm really happy to be back	Nishimiye rwose gutaha
Whether at home.	Yaba ari murugo.
I did that pretty recently	Nakoze ibyo bihagije vuba aha
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
He's a good guy to be around.	Ni umusore mwiza kuba hafi.
I need to know who he is	Nkeneye kumenya uwo yumva
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko atari azi neza.
I just didn't know why	Gusa sinari nzi iyo mpamvu
He hasn't been here long.	Ntabwo amaze igihe kinini hano.
I was not sure what to do	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora
I knew what it was	Nari nzi icyo aricyo
He loves everything in everything.	Akunda ibintu byose muri byose.
I knew he would be there	Nari nzi ko azaba ahari
Well, just one.	Nibyiza, kimwe gusa.
That's good. 	Ni byiza.
'	'
And it is not easy.	Kandi ntabwo byoroshye.
I never understood why	Sinigeze numva neza impamvu
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza kandi mubyukuri.
I did really badly	Nakoze nabi rwose
I can't understand the problem.	Sinshobora kumva ikibazo.
But he knew he had the truth.	Ariko yari azi ko afite ukuri.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And we have nothing.	Kandi ntacyo dufite.
Each of us sat in his film.	Buri wese muri twe yicaye muri firime ye.
It would be nice to be home.	Byari byiza kuba murugo.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yagombaga kugura igihe gusa.
First sight.	Kubona bwa mbere.
As his father must.	Nkuko se agomba.
We didn't need to.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye.
Maybe you can find something else for him.	Ahari ushobora kubona ikindi kintu kuri we.
Not bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi.
I want to be your wife	Ndashaka kuba umugore wawe
What he thought.	Icyo yatekerezaga.
I wanted to be very high	Nashakaga kuba hejuru cyane
You can see everything, you can hear everything.	Urashobora kubona byose, urashobora kumva byose.
I love children.	Nkunda abana.
I never thought that.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko.
I didn't need to	Ntabwo nari nkeneye
He left quickly.	Yagiye vuba.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I have to be close	Ngomba kuba hafi
No one was around.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hafi ye.
But you love your wife.	Ariko ukunda umugore wawe.
All together	Bose hamwe.
For me.	Kuri njye.
I can't wait	Sinshobora gutegereza
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Sinzi neza niba aribyo.
This is good.	Uyu ni mwiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
You can't learn that.	Ntushobora kwiga ibyo.
I think it's absolutely possible.	Ndatekereza ko bishoboka rwose.
Someone very intelligent once told me	Umuntu uzi ubwenge cyane yigeze kumbwira
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
But that is the problem.	Ariko icyo ni ikibazo.
It would be really nice here.	Byaba byiza rwose hano.
You were so beautiful.	Wari mwiza rwose.
We are not many.	Ntabwo turi benshi.
He never had.	Ntiyigeze agira.
I had heard enough	Nari numvise bihagije
Living is right.	Kubana nibyo.
Good question here	Ikibazo cyiza hano
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I think that's good.	Ndakeka ko aribyo byiza.
I mean bad	Ndashaka kuvuga nabi
I can't believe any of this is the case	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera na kimwe muri byo muri iki kibazo
I wanted her to be my wife	Nashakaga ko aba umugore wanjye
Not really good.	Ntabwo ari byiza rwose.
He thought I should do the same	Yatekereje ko nanjye nkwiye kubikora
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ibyo ni ukuri.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
I know exactly what you mean	Nzi neza icyo ushaka kuvuga
Good little thing.	Ikintu gito cyiza.
It’s not a walking party.	Ntabwo ari ibirori byo kugenda.
He longs for it.	Yifuza cyane.
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
I saw something.	Nabonye ikintu.
He would not exist.	Ntabwo yari kubaho.
People like me.	Abantu nkanjye.
I need to go	Nkeneye kugenda
You can.	Urashobora.
I have one like him	Mfite umwe nka we
A woman knows everything about her children	Umugore azi byose kubana be
It would have been easy, too.	Byari kuba byoroshye, kandi.
I don't see anyone.	Nta muntu mbona.
He thought he didn't have it in him.	Yatekereje ko atari afite muri we.
But I can't.	Ariko ntashobora.
Good party, that's right	Ibirori byiza, nibyo
He chose to stay here.	Yahisemo kuguma hano.
That's not a bad idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi.
You are a person like me.	Uri umuntu nkanjye.
I think it was good.	Ndatekereza ko byari byiza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I just didn't know what to do	Gusa sinari nzi icyo gukora
No.	Na.
I can't wait to do this	Sinshobora gutegereza gukora ibi
I should be in school	Nkwiye kuba mwishuri
That was a great thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza cyane.
He had problems.	Yari afite ibibazo.
I am very young.	Ndi muto cyane.
Sometimes it will, sometimes it will not.	Rimwe na rimwe bizaba, rimwe na rimwe sibyo.
I knew exactly what it was	Nari nzi neza icyo aricyo
Even today.	No muri iki gihe.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I enjoyed this question.	Nishimiye iki kibazo.
I can't read much.	Sinshobora gusoma byinshi.
For him.	Kuri we.
I have no job.	Nta kazi mfite.
I just had an idea but it's too soon	Gusa nagize igitekerezo ariko ni vuba cyane
I know you want to go back to school	Nzi ko ushaka gusubira ku ishuri
That's what he did.	Nibyo yakoze.
In that we can never be too much.	Muri ibyo ntidushobora na rimwe kuba byinshi.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
You are out.	Uri hanze.
He is a very good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
But here's the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo kibi.
He didn't have much money.	Ntabwo yari afite amafaranga menshi.
I was looking for someone with a good mind.	Nashakaga umuntu utekereza neza.
He wants out.	Ashaka hanze.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
', and it is'.	', kandi ni'.
I heard nothing.	Nta kintu numvise.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona na rimwe
He loves that.	Akunda ibyo.
I understand why	Ndumva impamvu
I have to try to think	Ngomba kugerageza gutekereza
I was not going to go back	Ntabwo nari ngiye gusubira inyuma
He has to try hard.	Agomba kugerageza cyane.
And that's really cool.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza rwose.
The child may need to study	Umwana arashobora kuba akwiye kwiga
I knew what you were doing	Nari nzi ibyo ukora
I never saw him go.	Sinigeze mbona agenda.
I'm doing something wrong, but I'm not sure where.	Ndimo gukora ikintu kibi, ariko sinzi neza aho.
I hope for more money.	Ndizera ko amafaranga menshi.
We need the inside.	Dukeneye imbere.
And you were a beautiful woman there.	Kandi wari umugore mwiza cyane aho.
And no problem.	Kandi nta kibazo.
Living together is great.	Kubana ni byiza cyane.
Very good, very good.	Nibyiza cyane, cyane.
I wouldn't do it.	Ntabwo nari kubikora.
You are ashamed.	Ufite isoni.
I hope he is close	Ndizera ko ari hafi
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari ukuri.
I wanted to stop living	Nashakaga kureka kubaho
But it's just a movie.	Ariko ni firime gusa.
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
I am.	Ngiye.
I didn’t know the guy very well	Ntabwo nari nzi neza umusore
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I should go back.	Nkwiye gusubira inyuma.
I know this problem	Nzi iki kibazo
I did not have a child	Ntabwo nagize umwana
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
We don’t have to do well.	Ntabwo tugomba gukora neza.
Everything is fine now.	Byose ni byiza ubu.
Outside, great success.	Hanze, gutsinda cyane.
Maybe he said something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo yavuze.
It would not be easy.	Ntabwo byaba byoroshye.
That's exactly what he needed.	Nukuri ibyo yari akeneye.
Really nice guy	Umusore mwiza rwose
I didn't get the time.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Who knows what he was thinking.	Ninde uzi icyo yatekerezaga.
I meant	Nashakaga kuvuga
I feel sad sometimes	Ndumva mbabajwe nukuri rimwe na rimwe
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I don't know where he is.	Sinzi aho ari.
If you can do it, you did it.	Niba ushobora kubikora, wabikoze.
I didn't see it coming	Ntabwo nabonye kuza
I wanted to stay for a while	Nashakaga kuguma igihe gito
I should do it one day	Nkwiye kubikora umunsi umwe
And he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Kandi azi ko ari uwo yari yiteze.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
I saw nothing wrong	Ntacyo nabonye kibi
You are a good thing.	Wowe ikintu cyiza.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
One thing one day, another another.	Ikintu kimwe umunsi umwe, ikindi ikindi.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
This was normal.	Ibi byari ibintu bisanzwe.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
I want to say goodbye.	Ndashaka kuvuga neza.
Please, we really need it.	Nyamuneka, dukeneye rwose.
You have a family.	Ufite umuryango.
I really don't think so.	Ntabwo rwose ntekereza ko aribyo.
I was sure it was	Nari nzi neza ko aribyo
This was his whole family.	Uyu yari umuryango we wose.
I thought it was really good	Natekereje ko byari byiza rwose
But he knew full well that he was right.	Ariko yari azi neza ko afite ukuri.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
I saw it as an opportunity	Nabonye ko ari amahirwe
I had many friends	Nari mfite inshuti nyinshi
For him	Kuri we
All of this was very common.	Ibi byose byari bisanzwe cyane.
There is only one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I never liked him, or him	Sinigeze nkunda, cyangwa we
Really kids.	Abana rwose.
He wanted to say what he said.	Yashakaga kuvuga ibyo yavuze.
He enjoyed this however.	Yishimiye ibi ariko.
I think we can be lucky	Ndatekereza ko dushobora kugira amahirwe
I was not sure who he was or what he was	Sinari nzi neza uwo ari we cyangwa icyo ari cyo
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
I need to be with him today.	Nkeneye kubana na we muri iki gihe.
Money is not the issue.	Amafaranga ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
A woman cannot 'do so.	Umugore ntashobora 'gutya.
You need to know your position.	Ugomba kumenya umwanya wawe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, umwana we.
I am very happy to be here	Nishimiye cyane kuza hano
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
I have no plans.	Nta gahunda mfite.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
And that was it.	Kandi ibyo byari byo.
There are many.	Hariho benshi.
Mostly, obviously.	Byinshi, biragaragara.
I feel really good	Ndumva ari mwiza rwose
But it is not true.	Ariko si ukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Hamwe nibyo umuntu ashobora gukora.
I wanted something small, but not too small.	Nashakaga ikintu gito, ariko ntabwo ari gito cyane.
I thought she was beautiful	Natekerezaga ko yari mwiza
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
Maybe he should tell someone.	Ahari agomba kubwira umuntu.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
I guess you saw it go	Ndakeka ko wabonye kugenda
It was really nice to see someone who knows below.	Byari byiza rwose kubona umuntu uzi hasi aha.
He has.	Afite.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
I should be one.	Nkwiye kuba umwe.
We are good friends	Turi inshuti nziza.
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza rwose.
He went for money or for something else.	Yagiye gushaka amafaranga cyangwa gushaka ikindi kintu.
Great time.	Igihe cyiza cyane.
I do a job now that I love	Nkora akazi ubu nkunda
He was here early.	Yari hano kare.
You can do it instead of doing it.	Urashobora kubikora aho kubikora.
It wasn’t a movie, but it would make a good movie.	Ntabwo yari firime, ariko yari gukora firime nziza.
I think he has a gift	Ntekereza ko afite impano
I needed to work.	Nari nkeneye gukora.
I know you can do better	Nzi ko ushobora gukora neza
I got some good advice once.	Nabonye inama nziza rimwe.
He is not like him.	Ntabwo ari nka we.
But he said nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yavuze.
I don't know why here	Ntabwo nzi impamvu ari hano
It was something everyone could do.	Byari ikintu buri wese yashoboraga gukora.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
I needed to know if	Nari nkeneye kumenya niba
Someone has something to say.	Umuntu ufite icyo avuga.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo aricyo.
I never saw anything	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ikintu
You can.	Ushobora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I feel the same way	Nanjye hari icyo numva
You go tomorrow.	Ugiye ejo.
I love hearing what everyone has to say!	Nkunda kumva icyo buri wese avuga!
I have done nothing wrong	Nta kibi nigeze nkora
If you want to study.	Niba ushaka kwiga.
He did not even know who his father was.	Ntiyari azi na se uwo ari we.
Could he have known?!.	Yashoboraga kumenya?!.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
Where is he.	Ari he.
Maybe he would do it now.	Birashoboka ko yari kubikora ubu.
He was still one, he was still one for her.	Yari akiri umwe, yari akiri umwe kuri we.
It would not go well.	Ntabwo byari kugenda neza.
But it is not the same as being alone.	Ariko ntabwo ari kimwe no kuba wenyine.
Nothing to do.	Ntacyo gukora.
Out and about.	Hanze na kure.
I just have time	Mfite umwanya gusa
I knew you meant to say goodbye	Nari nzi ko ushaka kuvuga neza
There is a lot going on lately.	Hariho byinshi vuba aha.
I didn't need a friend	Sinari nkeneye inshuti
At home.	Murugo murugo.
He can do a lot.	Arashobora gukora byinshi.
I can do that with him	Nshobora kugira ibyo hamwe na we
I mean, absolutely not	Ndashaka kuvuga, rwose sibyo
I had a nice house.	Nari mfite inzu nziza.
That was it.	Uwo yari.
I don't want to go down again.	Sinshaka kongera kujya munsi.
He probably didn't hear anything.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo yumvise.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
I can go home soon	Nshobora gutaha vuba
He was better than that.	Yari mwiza kuruta ibyo.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
But this was just a party.	Ariko ibi byari ibirori gusa.
I was out.	Nari hanze.
I didn't know why	Sinari nzi impamvu ibi
We would live.	Twari kubaho.
I was going to be a teacher	Nari ngiye kuba umwarimu
He saw everything.	Yabonye ibintu byose.
But he is not an expert.	Ariko ntabwo ari umuhanga.
He had to be her.	Yagombaga kuba we.
That's all he needed to hear.	Ibyo aribyo byose yari akeneye kumva.
I do well alone.	Nkora neza wenyine.
I had a problem.	Nari mfite ikibazo.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
I haven't seen it since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona
I was a child too	Nanjye nari umwana
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
I don't think so	Ntekereza ko, atari byo
I want this more than anything else	Ndashaka ibi kuruta byose
I mean, that wasn’t the plan	Ndashaka kuvuga, iyo ntiyari gahunda
I can never be with you again	Ntabwo nshobora kongera kubana nawe
I need a job.	Nkeneye akazi.
That was difficult enough.	Ibyo byari bigoye bihagije.
I needed to know where he was	Nari nkeneye kumenya aho yari ari
Simple things.	Ibintu byoroshye.
Maybe it's good.	Ahari nibyiza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, yavuze ko yagiye.
She is my wife.	Ni umugore wanjye.
I love your hair.	Nkunda umusatsi wawe.
You can't do that at all.	Ntushobora kubikora rwose.
I thought he would be here	Natekereje ko azaba hano
I didn't know it was possible	Sinari nzi ko bishoboka
I didn't know it existed	Sinari nzi ko ahari
He can do it.	Ashobora kubikora.
He is not a young man.	Ntabwo ari umusore.
The girl was my age.	Umukobwa yari imyaka yanjye.
I like to live with him	Nkunda kubana na we
Or maybe he has.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko afite.
He has no reason to believe that he can do it.	Nta mpamvu afite yo kwizera ko ashobora kubikora.
Friends	Inshuti
I can't, or anyone.	Ntabwo nshobora, cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
And he would do the same.	Kandi na we yari kubikora.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko ibyo nta cyo byari.
I am anything but perfect.	Ndi ikintu cyose ariko neza neza.
I need to know where you want to go	Nkeneye kumenya aho ushaka kujya
I can't believe she has a baby	Sinshobora kwizera ko afite umwana
I really want to say this.	Ndashaka kuvuga ibi rwose.
I don't know if that's the case.	Sinzi niba aricyo kibazo.
My age is very high.	Imyaka yanjye cyane.
I should have seen	Nari nkwiye kubona
And that's not what he wanted.	Kandi ntabwo aribyo yashakaga.
And he was.	Kandi yari.
I'm not going to let this happen.	Ntabwo ngiye kureka ibi.
I didn't know you were alone	Sinari nzi ko uri wenyine
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
Maybe that would have been enough.	Ahari ibyo byari kuba bihagije.
I think he is doing well	Ntekereza ko akora neza
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
It's just that, like.	Ni gusa, nka.
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
I know everything	Nzi ibintu byose
I think we have.	Ndatekereza ko dufite.
Food for thought.	Ibiryo byo gutekereza.
But for me.	Ariko kuri njye.
The whole day was beautiful.	Umunsi wose wari mwiza cyane.
I just didn't know how to stop things	Gusa sinari nzi guhagarika ibintu
But we have to try.	Ariko tugomba kugerageza.
I was not good at waiting	Ntabwo nari mwiza gutegereza
You don't know how to do it right.	Ntabwo uzi kubikora neza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
As everyone else does.	Nkuko buri wese abikora.
Family, close by	Umuryango, uri hafi
I thought about it	Natekereje neza
But there is a lot to learn.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
I just know he did it	Gusa nzi ko yabikoze
You can't wait to come.	Ntushobora gutegereza kuza.
I want it all now	Ndashaka byose ubu
Really, really	Nukuri, rwose
It is not too late.	Ntabwo ari nyuma cyane.
That will be difficult.	Ibyo bizaba bigoye.
I should have gone	Nari nkwiye kujyana
I think it was for me too	Ntekereza ko byari no kuri njye
He was a good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza.
Apparently I enjoyed that	Biragaragara ko nishimiye ibyo
I needed someone who knew what he was doing	Nari nkeneye umuntu uzi ibyo akora
My clothes.	Imyenda yanjye.
But many were.	Ariko benshi bari.
But I have a short time to live	Mfite ariko igihe gito cyo kubaho
To live.	Kubana.
I ask who he is	Ndabaza uwo ari we
That's what he said.	Ibyo ni byo yavuze.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
I wanted to do all this	Nashakaga gukora ibi byose
Something about that.	Ikintu kuri ibyo.
I want to talk to you again	Ndashaka kongera kuvugana nawe
It's time.	Ni igihe.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
I felt bad	Numvise nabi
I'm really scared.	Mfite ubwoba rwose.
I have a job to do here	Mfite akazi nkora hano
I like to go to work.	Nkunda kujya ku kazi.
I am very far away	Ndi kure cyane
He was good at that.	Yari mwiza kuri ibyo.
I didn't get the chance	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe
School friend	Inshuti yo mwishuri
I like being so close	Nkunda kuba hafi gutya
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
That was enough for him.	Ibyo byari bihagije kuri we.
I'm behind him	Ndi inyuma ye
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I think we have to go back	Ndatekereza ko tugomba gusubira inyuma
I'm not young	Ntabwo ndimo kuba muto
He was not behind me.	Ntiyari inyuma yanjye.
He said one good thing to me.	Yavuze ikintu kimwe cyiza kuri njye.
He could work in that world.	Yashoboraga gukora muri iyo si.
I understand his point but I feel he is making a mistake.	Ndumva igitekerezo cye ariko numva akora amakosa.
People were nearby.	Abantu bari hafi.
I have found what to do so far	Nabonye ibyo gukora kugeza ubu
This was good for us.	Ibi byari byiza kuri twe.
I didn't want to talk to you	Sinifuzaga kuvugana nawe
I need to know something	Ngomba kumenya ikintu
I have to wait.	Ngomba gutegereza.
You have to.	Ugomba nawe.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
I need to tell people	Nkeneye kubwira abantu
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda na gato
You think you only have this thing.	Uratekereza ko ufite iki kintu gusa.
I love living with you	Nkunda kubana nawe
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
Not many problems.	Ntabwo ari ibibazo byinshi.
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda na gato
He would do nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yari gukora.
I didn't get the chance to make a mistake	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo gukora amakosa
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora.
You can't figure out why.	Ntushobora kumenya impamvu.
You know nothing.	Ntacyo uzi.
He can speak.	Arashobora kuvuga.
I know what it is	Nzi icyo aricyo
It's as good as ever.	Nibyiza nkuko bisanzwe.
I know your age	Nzi imyaka yawe
I knew exactly who he was	Nari nzi neza uwo ari we
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
And he is.	Kandi ari.
I think it was almost time	Ndakeka ko byari hafi igihe
One cannot help who one is.	Umuntu ntashobora gufasha uwo ari we.
I want to go home now	Ndashaka gutaha ubu
I saw nothing, nothing	Ntacyo nabonye, ​​nta kintu na kimwe
You were here.	Wari hano.
I wanted to be human.	Nashakaga kuba umuntu.
I was sure that	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo
This one was home, and he was here.	Iyi yari murugo, kandi yari hano.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza ko aribyo.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
For me, it was great.	Kuri njye, byari byiza cyane.
Nothing big.	Nta kintu kinini.
But nothing too big.	Ariko nta kintu kinini cyane.
I can't give up	Sinshobora kureka
Very close but very far.	Hafi cyane ariko kure cyane.
I really want to hear something, everything	Ndashaka cyane kumva ikintu, ikintu cyose
It is one of the schools.	Ni kimwe mu ishuri.
They have problems.	Bafite ibibazo.
I think it has been a long time	Ndakeka ko yamaze igihe kinini
I guess you have.	Ndakeka ko ufite.
Stop doing something.	Kureka gukora ikintu.
But none of that.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
I knew in that look that he had left home	Nari nzi neza ko kuva murugo
I didn't know it was possible	Ntabwo nari nzi ko bishoboka
I know it's my fault	Nzi ko ari amakosa yanjye
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
I thought a lot.	Natekereje cyane.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
I didn't mean to offend you	Sinigeze nshaka kuvuga ko nta kibi
Here it is now.	Hano ni ubu.
Today I am very happy to be with you	Uyu munsi nishimiye cyane kubana nawe
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Walking and walking.	Kugenda no kugenda.
I'm not sure if he can	Sinzi neza niba ashobora
I knew it was going to be a big deal	Nari nzi ko bizaba ikintu kinini
I was not sure about him.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza kuri we.
If you have a drinking problem, stop drinking.	Ufite ikibazo cyo kunywa, reka kunywa.
This is something else.	Iki ni ikindi kintu.
You can go back to work or school.	Urashobora gusubira ku kazi cyangwa ku ishuri.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I was not sure what he was talking about	Sinari nzi neza ibyo avuga
We were children.	Twari abana.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
You know what he wanted.	Uzi icyo yashakaga.
He never had a chance.	Ntabwo yigeze agira amahirwe.
Please, this time.	Nyamuneka, iki gihe.
And that is true.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri.
It is also a problem.	Ni ikibazo kandi.
It was something close to a long time.	Byari ibintu hafi mugihe kinini.
Of course he would know.	Ni ukuri yari kumenya.
I was not sure where he was	Sinari nzi neza aho ari
I feel right.	Numva ari ukuri.
And it is not easy.	Kandi ntabwo byoroshye.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I wonder how we can know where we are	Ndabaza uburyo dushobora kumenya aho turi
I was scared and scared	Nagize ubwoba kandi mfite ubwoba
I think he’s just scared	Ntekereza ko afite ubwoba gusa
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
Today was a very bad day.	Uyu munsi wari mubi cyane.
Before, you were on your schedule.	Mbere, wari kuri gahunda yawe.
You can go as fast as you can.	Urashobora kugenda vuba bishoboka.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
That's a big deal.	Icyo ni ikintu kinini.
I had this morning.	Nari mfite muri iki gitondo.
But that is not good for me.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
There is so much, everyone.	Hariho byinshi, abantu bose.
He was sitting there.	Yari yicaye aho.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
I didn't do much wrong	Ntabwo nakoze nabi cyane
He had to do something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo akora.
I was not sure what happened	Sinari nzi neza uko byagenze
I just love this one	Gusa nkunda iyi
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
The hair is the same.	Umusatsi ni umwe.
I know all the good things to say, and	Nzi ibintu byose byiza byo kuvuga, kandi
I can't believe the boy is me	Sinshobora kwizera ko umuhungu ari njye
He can have anything.	Arashobora kugira ikintu na kimwe.
He may have a plan.	Ashobora kuba afite gahunda.
I should have known better	Nari nkwiye kumenya ko atari byo
I need something else	Nkeneye ikindi kintu
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, igihe kinini.
I had a problem	Nari mfite ikibazo
He never spoke.	Ntiyigeze avuga.
There is always a reason.	Buri gihe hariho impamvu.
And people stay.	Kandi abantu kuguma.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But it worked.	Ariko byagenze neza.
I think that's the big deal	Ntekereza ko aricyo kinini kinini
You know we have.	Uzi ko dufite.
I hope you have the truth	Ndizera ko ushobora kuba ufite ukuri
I'm bad	Ndi mubi
He sits well.	Yicaye neza.
But we have to wait now.	Ariko tugomba gutegereza ubu.
But he meant a child.	Ariko yashakaga kuvuga umwana.
I think you said enough	Ntekereza ko wavuze bihagije
i'm playing	ndimo gukina.
However, there was nothing that one could do at the time.	Ariko, nta kintu na kimwe umuntu yashoboraga gukora icyo gihe.
I never heard of anything	Sinigeze numva icyo aricyo cyose
We have to live together.	Tugomba kubana.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
I’m doing something good here	Ndimo gukora ikintu cyiza hano
I should have done that now.	Nari nkwiye kubikora nonaha.
He thought that whatever it was, he was gone.	Yatekereje ko ibyo aribyo byose, yagiye.
I hope he is a good person below	Nizera ko ari umuntu mwiza munsi
But it is better to have problems.	Ariko ni byiza kugira ibibazo.
I shouldn’t have eaten too much	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kurya cyane
Soon, in fact.	Vuba, mubyukuri.
We need help.	Dukeneye ubufasha.
A woman should eat well	Umugore agomba kurya neza
I need to know the truth	Ngomba kumenya ukuri
You are not at the same time.	Ntabwo uri mugihe kimwe.
He may be alone.	Ashobora kuba wenyine.
I think it's possible	Ntekereza ko bishoboka
Win here.	Gutsinda hano.
Like no house.	Nka nta nzu.
But now you have to do it right.	Ariko ubu ugomba kubikora neza.
In fact, he asked for advice.	Mubyukuri, yasabye inama.
Everything he saw was true.	Ibyo yabonye byose ni ukuri.
I have to be doing something good	Ngomba kuba nkora ikintu cyiza
I don't know what to say	Ntabwo nzi kuvuga ibi
It's the same with you.	Ni kimwe nawe.
I need to go a little farther	Nkeneye kujya kure gato
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I need to talk to you before he leaves.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe mbere yuko agenda.
I mean, you know exactly who you are	Ndashaka kuvuga, uzi neza uwo uri we
I think this is really good.	Ntekereza ko iyi ari nziza rwose.
But that is clear.	Ariko ibyo biragaragara.
I'm not sorry	Ntabwo mbabajwe
He didn't look up.	Ntabwo yarebye hejuru.
He would not have received the money.	Ntabwo yari kubona amafaranga.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
I think that's good	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza
They don't have more money than I do.	Ntabwo bafite amafaranga menshi kundusha.
I don't want to be bad	Sinshaka kuba mubi
He could have carried that.	Yashoboraga gutwara ibyo.
I never thought it would be easy	Sinigeze ntekereza ko byoroshye
I found a way to live	Nabonye uburyo bwo kubaho
He did not know that there was.	Ntiyari azi ko hariho.
He is a smart boy.	Ni umuhungu uzi ubwenge.
Or try.	Cyangwa kugerageza.
The girl really knew what she wanted.	Umukobwa rwose yari azi icyo ashaka.
And you can't go back now.	Kandi ntushobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
You want, you want, you want !.	Ushaka, ushaka, ushaka!.
It’s a real thing, really.	Ni ikintu rwose, mubyukuri.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
You don’t have to go back.	Ntugomba gusubira inyuma.
I think we can be together	Ntekereza ko dushobora kuba hamwe
You really had to come here.	Wari ufite ukuri rwose kuza hano.
I'm glad everything went well	Nishimiye ko byose byagenze neza
It's a good day.	Ni umunsi mwiza.
Eventually, he said nothing.	Amaherezo, ntacyo yavuze.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
I have nothing to do with that	Ntacyo nshobora gukora kuri ibyo
It's not here.	Ntabwo ari hano hafi.
He needs his time.	Akeneye umwanya we.
It was not close.	Ntabwo byari hafi yo.
He loves to play.	Akunda gukina.
I don't want to do that	Sinshaka kubikora
I really didn't want to talk to you now	Sinifuzaga rwose kuvugana nawe ubu
There was nothing that anyone could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe umuntu yashoboraga gukora.
Where are you ?.	Aho uri?.
I needed to think about everything	Nari nkeneye gutekereza kuri buri kintu
I heard nothing about it	Ntacyo numvise kuri ibyo
I know someone who knows this person.	Nzi umuntu uzi uyu muntu.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
That is something else he said.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu yavuze.
He has been here ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe ari hano.
I can't wait to get out of here.	Sinshobora gutegereza kuva hano.
We have to try.	Tugomba kugerageza.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
He had not come for money.	Ntabwo yari yaje gushaka amafaranga.
I mean, this is a good time for me	Ndashaka kuvuga, iki ni igihe cyiza kuri njye
They know where you are.	Bazi aho uri.
I just love the family.	Gusa nkunda umuryango.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
He did not come.	Ntabwo yaje.
Maybe it would be better.	Ahari byaba byiza.
He thought he could do something about it.	Yatekereje ko ashobora kugira icyo akora ku kazi.
I saw that.	Nabonye ibyo.
I need to think about this	Nkeneye gutekereza kuri iki kintu
He did, however.	Yakoze ariko.
That would have been much easier.	Ibyo byari kuba byoroshye cyane.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
Question.	Ikibazo.
He has.	Afite.
You want to know everything.	Urashaka kumenya byose.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
Nothing would happen today.	Uyu munsi ntacyo byari kuba.
Someone.	Umuntu.
We have to live.	Tugomba kubaho.
I didn't want to talk to anyone	Sinifuzaga kuvugana n'umuntu uwo ari we wese
That's it for you.	Nibyo nawe.
He said he was not.	Yavuze ko atari we.
I want you to be with me	Ndashaka ko muri njye
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, byagenze neza amaherezo.
I think you should stay here	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kuguma hano
I knew he was listening	Nari nzi ko yumva
She was so beautiful	Yari mwiza cyane
I want him to say a lot.	Ndashaka ko avuga byinshi.
I really don't know.	Ntacyo nzi mubyukuri.
They were so many.	Bari benshi cyane.
But she is just a woman.	Ariko ni umugore gusa.
He did it at a young age.	Yabikoze akiri muto.
He began to retreat.	Yatangiye gusubira inyuma.
I know we can do that.	Nzi ko dushobora kubikora.
He would see nothing.	Ntacyo yari kubona.
He was right, too.	Na we yari afite ukuri.
They are not children.	Ntabwo ari abana.
I knew he wanted to live	Nari nzi ko ashaka kubaho
But this is not all.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo byose.
I have a lot of opportunities to play.	Mfite amahirwe menshi yo gukina.
I want to know who.	Ndashaka kumenya uwo.
I hope you do well	Nizere ko ukora neza
But he wants to be.	Ariko arashaka kuba.
You know what.	Waba uzi icyo.
Very nice girl	Umukobwa mwiza cyane
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
It is not a good car.	Ntabwo ari imodoka nziza.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I didn't need to think	Sinari nkeneye gutekereza
He tried to retreat.	Yagerageje gusubira inyuma.
I enjoy anything	Nishimiye ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
Your family should want to go home.	Umuryango wawe ugomba gushaka gusubira murugo.
I was bad	Ninjye wari mubi
Absolutely not for me.	Rwose ntabwo byari kuri njye.
He says he will do it later.	Avuga ko azabikora nyuma.
I am very happy to be leaving now.	Nishimiye cyane kugenda ubu.
You are one of us.	Uri umwe muri twe.
You are human, not something.	Uri umuntu, ntabwo ari ikintu.
Really good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza rwose.
I got all the questions right	Nabonye ibibazo byose neza
I hope that's what you like	Nizere ko aribyo ukunda
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
Now I know he was right.	Ubu nzi ko yari afite ukuri.
Se.	Se.
It was good to go.	Byari byiza kugenda.
I know the things you need to know	Nzi ibintu ugomba kumenya
At any time.	Igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
He was looking for something.	Yashakaga ikintu.
I don't know who he is.	Ntazi uwo ari we.
They would study.	Bari kwiga.
He used to talk to her.	Yakundaga kuvugana na we.
You can do this easily at home.	Urashobora kubikora byoroshye murugo.
I think they are on me.	Ndatekereza ko bari kuri njye.
I know that is true	Nzi ko ibyo ari ukuri
But that is not the case.	Ariko icyo si ikibazo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And that's fine.	Kandi nibyiza.
You came later.	Niwowe yaje nyuma.
I had a lot of plans.	Nari mfite gahunda nyinshi.
He has nothing.	Nta na kimwe afite.
One more thing.	Ikindi kintu kimwe.
I'm glad you're my friend too	Nishimiye ko nawe uri inshuti yanjye
I just wanted to tell the truth	Nashakaga kuvuga gusa ukuri
''	''.
I need someone.	Nkeneye umuntu.
And all.	Kandi byose.
That was difficult.	Ibyo byari bigoye.
But there is more, more.	Ariko hariho byinshi, byinshi.
This time it was good.	Iki gihe byari byiza.
He says he will do it.	Avuga ko azabikora.
I didn't know that.	Sinari nzi icyo kintu.
I should also watch and study	Nkwiye kureba no kwiga
I just want to	Ndashaka gusa
I once heard a party	Nigeze kumva ibirori
I'm not going to give up	Ntabwo ngiye kureka
Like his father.	Kimwe na se.
He is alone.	Ari wenyine.
His mistakes were many.	Amakosa ye yari menshi.
My family loves to hear.	Umuryango wanjye ukunda cyane kumva.
I wanted to know everything about him	Nashakaga kumenya byose kuri we
I never understood why he did that at the time	Sinigeze numva impamvu yabikoze icyo gihe
I can't believe this is my house	Sinshobora kwizera ko iyi ari inzu yanjye
No one is right.	Nta n'umwe ari ukuri.
I had another problem.	Nari mfite ikindi kibazo.
I’m so glad I didn’t have to try	Nishimiye cyane kuba ntagomba kugerageza
I know who he is	Nzi uwo ari we
I can't be a better boy.	Sinshobora kuba umuhungu mwiza.
Come on.	Hasi.
And that’s a good thing.	Kandi ni ikintu cyiza.
I don't even know where they are.	Ntazi n'aho bari.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
I knew you didn't want to	Nari nzi ko nawe udashaka
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I know something we can do	Nzi ikintu dushobora gukora
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
Too much to say.	Benshi cyane kuvuga.
Playing is easy.	Gukina byoroshye.
And he can.	Kandi arashobora.
He did not know the day.	Ntabwo yari azi umunsi.
He was good, but he was good.	Yari mwiza, ariko wari mwiza.
I have my car here	Mfite imodoka yanjye hano
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
There is one thing outside.	Hanze hari ikintu kimwe.
It hadn't gone wrong.	Ntabwo byari byagenze nabi.
I just see friends	Gusa mbona inshuti
I told no one	Nta muntu nabwiye
I once lived	Nanjye nigeze kubaho
Probably.	Birashoboka.
In fact, that is not always the case.	Mubyukuri, ibyo ntabwo buri gihe ari ukuri.
I never saw you look good	Sinigeze mbona ko usa neza
I guess you have to do it tonight.	Ndakeka ko ugomba gukora iri joro.
I want to do it right	Ndashaka kubikora neza
Nothing to wait for.	Nta kintu cyo gutegereza.
I think that's true	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri
I don’t know many people.	Sinzi abantu benshi.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
You are not sure if that is the case.	Ntabwo uzi neza niba aribyo.
However, you cannot do this.	Ariko, ntushobora kubikora.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
You can tell me.	Urashobora kumbwira.
I thought it was great	Natekereje ko byari byiza cyane
I can carry anything	Nshobora gutwara ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
That was as close as it could get.	Ibyo byari hafi cyane nkuko byagenze.
I didn’t want to be down	Sinifuzaga kuba hasi
You can get a job upstairs.	Urashobora kubona akazi hejuru.
He did what he was supposed to do.	Yakoze ibyo yagombaga gukora.
I have your daughter	Mfite umukobwa wawe
I don’t know if he feels the same way	Ntabwo nzi niba yumva ibintu kimwe
Apparently you saw nothing.	Biragaragara ko ntacyo wabonye.
Not very good, but possible.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane, ariko birashoboka.
Many good reasons.	Impamvu nyinshi nziza.
I want more children	Ndashaka abana benshi
Big question after all.	Ikibazo kinini nyuma ya byose.
You know the truth.	Uzi ukuri.
I do everything and work hard when there is work to be done.	Nkora ikintu cyose kandi nkora cyane mugihe hari akazi.
I guess he knows what he's up to	Ndakeka ko azi ibyo arimo
But he says nothing.	Ariko ntacyo avuga.
Sometimes it seems to be true.	Rimwe na rimwe birasa nkaho ari ukuri.
We are so many now.	Turi benshi cyane ubu.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
I don't need this thing	Ntabwo nkeneye iki kintu
He is the first.	Niwe wa mbere.
You can't come here.	Ntushobora kuza hano.
He was his father.	Yari se.
The car was very nice.	Imodoka yari nziza cyane.
I am the only one.	Uwo ni njye wenyine.
I have one daughter.	Mfite umukobwa umwe.
We have to try everything.	Tugomba kugerageza ibintu byose.
I can't see it then	Sinshobora kubona icyo gihe
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi.
But there is one more thing.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
I never wanted to go back.	Sinigeze nshaka gusubira inyuma.
Of course, you can.	Nukuri, urashobora.
I knew he had done it once	Nari nzi ko igihe kimwe yabikoze
I told them they were here.	Mbwira ko bari hano.
Not many people.	Ntabwo ari abantu benshi.
I think he was worried	Ntekereza ko yari afite impungenge
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
I was a young child.	Nari umwana muto.
This, however, is not the case here.	Ibi ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
I wanted things the way I wanted them to	Nashakaga ibintu uko nshaka
I can't get enough of a girl	Sinshobora kubona neza umukobwa
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ikibazo cyo kwizera gusa.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
I just thought you might want to know	Gusa natekereje ko ushobora gushaka kumenya
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He was close.	Yari hafi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo rwose ni ikibazo cyiza.
He is not a bad person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mubi.
But not for long.	Ariko si igihe kirekire.
I feel like they are many	Ndumva ari benshi
Where is he ?.	Ari he?.
I think that's a mistake	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari amakosa
I was not that person.	Ntabwo nari uwo muntu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I was sure that	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo
I thought you said you were a good player	Natekereje ko wavuze ko uri umukinnyi mwiza
I can't go back to jail, man	Sinshobora gusubira muri gereza, muntu
I'm glad that.	Nishimiye ibyo.
I had no job at all	Nta kazi na gato nari mfite
His father was right.	Se yari afite ukuri.
I know what he plans	Nzi icyo ateganya
You have to read your child.	Ugomba gusoma umwana wawe.
You can also get it.	Urashobora kandi kubona.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Not much, after all.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, amaherezo.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
But we have what we have.	Ariko dufite ibyo dufite.
You don't have one.	Ntabwo ufite.
I mean you have your hair	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ufite umusatsi wawe
Finally it went today.	Amaherezo yagiye uyu munsi.
It was too crowded.	Byari abantu benshi cyane.
I know it's hard	Nzi ko bigoye
I heard them all.	Numvise bose.
Nari.	Nari.
I knew he was one of us	Nari nzi ko ari umwe muri twe
It was only one day.	Wari umunsi umwe gusa.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
Or at any time, on that issue.	Cyangwa igihe icyo ari cyo cyose, kuri icyo kibazo.
I can't think of anything	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri byose
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
We were not very close.	Ntabwo twari hafi cyane.
I think it's very possible.	Ntekereza ko bishoboka cyane.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
If you want to stay here.	Niba ushaka kuguma hano.
Car.	Imodoka.
It was easy.	Byari ibintu byoroshye.
And it's great sometimes.	Kandi ni byiza cyane rimwe na rimwe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza, nibyiza cyane.
You saw nothing.	Ntacyo wabonye.
We are outside.	Turi hanze.
That sounds good to me.	Ibyo birasa neza kuri njye.
I have to take someone.	Ngomba gufata umuntu.
I had nothing for me.	Ntacyo nari mfite kuri njye.
I want her to be my wife	Ndashaka ko aba umugore wanjye
Just one thing.	Ikintu gusa.
He was young, 20 years old.	Yari muto, afite imyaka 20.
Time to think	Igihe cyo gutekereza
I'm happy to wait	Nishimiye gutegereza
You can't even imagine that it was true.	Ntushobora no gutekereza ko byari kuri.
I was not sure where.	Sinari nzi neza aho.
But he feels lucky.	Ariko yumva afite amahirwe.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
You know exactly who you are.	Uzi neza ko wari uzi uwo ari we.
Or maybe she had children.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari afite abana.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
Or did he know something about her.	Cyangwa hari icyo yari azi kuri we.
He didn't go, but it's good.	Ntabwo yagiye, ariko nibyiza.
I can't speak for now	Sinshobora kuvuga kuri ubu
He said he was not.	Yavuze ko atari we.
That's not what I want.	Ntabwo aribyo nshaka.
I know all that	Nzi ibyo byose
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
It will be better in the long run.	Bizaba byiza mugihe kirekire.
If you can see.	Niba ushobora kubona.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
To think	Gutekereza.
For him, however, this is not a problem.	Kuri we ariko, iki ntabwo ari ikibazo.
She felt scared	Yumvise afite ubwoba
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I wanted to live.	Nashakaga kubaho.
I never saw his idea	Sinigeze mbona igitekerezo cye
I didn’t think he had it in him	Sinatekerezaga ko yari afite muri we
I should have lived with you	Nari nkwiye kubana nawe
This was exactly what he had been looking for.	Ibi nibyo yari yagiye gushaka.
But you know someone.	Ariko uzi umuntu.
That’s a good thing to think about.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza cyo gutekereza.
I knew he had to be there	Nari nzi ko agomba kuba ahari
I feel like you have to give up what you love	Ndumva ugomba kureka ibyo ukunda
I really think he needs to talk to someone	Ndatekereza rwose ko akeneye kuvugana numuntu
He is not the same guy.	Ntabwo ari umusore umwe.
I know what it is	Nzi icyo aricyo
But what is it.	Ariko ni iki.
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
He thought I could do this	Yatekereje ko nshobora gukora ibi
It was something for me to look forward to, the same.	Byari ikintu kuri njye kureba imbere, kimwe.
I wanted to be with him.	Nashakaga kubana na we.
Niki.	Niki.
But it is also not a thing.	Ariko kandi ntabwo ari ikintu.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
I just didn't see much	Gusa sinigeze mbona ikintu kinini
I can do it one day	Nshobora gukora umunsi umwe
You have now.	Ufite ubu.
He loved all that.	Yakundaga ibyo byose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu byagenze neza cyane.
And none of us have a family.	Kandi nta n'umwe muri twe ufite umuryango.
I want only one wife	Ndashaka umugore umwe gusa
He said that was as close as he could get.	Yavuze ko ibyo byari hafi uko yashoboraga kubona.
That's really possible.	Ibyo rwose birashoboka.
I don’t believe he does all this	Ntabwo nizera ko akora ibi byose
He says he is not here.	Avuga ko atari hano.
But there is no time.	Ariko nta gihe.
This is not exactly the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I don't know if that's true.	Sinzi niba aribyo koko.
Especially with us.	Cyane cyane natwe.
I saw something else.	Nabonye ikindi kintu.
I'm here with you	Ninjye uri hano hamwe nawe
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
I was a beautiful woman to him	Nari umugore mwiza kuri we
By now, that was enough.	Kuri ubu, ibyo byari bihagije.
He said he has not done so since.	Yavuze ko kuva icyo gihe, atigeze abikora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I don't think that's a bad idea.	Ndakeka ko ibyo atari igitekerezo kibi.
We had a car.	Twari dufite imodoka.
I was sure there was something	Nari nzi neza ko hari ikintu
I have enough of that.	Mfite ibyo bihagije.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
He doesn't know exactly what we need.	Ntabwo azi neza icyo dukeneye.
Lots.	Byinshi.
I guess he shouldn't go	Ndakeka ko atagomba kugenda
I know how to play this	Nzi neza gukina ibi
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
I want to do it again	Ndashaka kongera kubikora
Very bad thing.	Ikintu kibi cyane.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
You know what it is.	Uzi icyo aricyo.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
I hope this is your family	Nizera ko uyu ari umuryango wawe
I think he has already resigned	Ndakeka ko yamaze kuva ku kazi
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He could do nothing and could not hear.	Ntacyo yashoboraga gukora kandi ntashobora kumva.
I didn't know that.	Ntabwo nari nzi kuri ibyo.
Tomorrow is the day.	Ejo ni umunsi.
I know exactly who you are	Nzi neza uwo uri we
Maybe you can live together.	Birashoboka ko ushobora kubana.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga ikintu kibi.
Anyone could live with that	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kubana nibyo
Most of it now.	Byinshi muri byo ubu.
It would be great to see.	Byaba byiza rwose kubona.
I can't see anything outside	Sinshobora kubona ikintu hanze
I was a really bad kid	Nari umwana mubi rwose
I never wanted any of that	Sinigeze nshaka na kimwe muri byo
But he made a mistake.	Ariko yakoze amakosa.
I was a very intelligent child	Nari umwana uzi ubwenge cyane
This was his first day at work.	Uyu wari umunsi we wa mbere ku kazi.
He loved that.	Yakundaga cyane ibyo.
All in all, he knew it was there.	Byose kimwe, yari azi ko ahari.
I really didn't want to talk to you now.	Sinifuzaga rwose kuvugana nawe ubu.
I was just thinking	Natekerezaga gusa
He feels good on the phone.	Yumva neza kuri terefone.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
They were nearby.	Bari hafi aho.
All in all, a good thing.	Byose muri byose, ikintu cyiza.
If you think about it first.	Niba utekereza ibi mbere.
He saw a lot.	Yabonye byinshi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
He is much closer to that.	Ari hafi cyane kurenza ibyo.
I hope it's good with you	Nizere ko ari byiza nawe
It was easy to see why.	Byari byoroshye kubona impamvu.
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
Anyway, at least we didn't go down without explaining ourselves first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, ntabwo twari dukeneye.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
That was it.	Ibyo byari.
You can't buy that time.	Ntushobora kugura icyo gihe.
But none of us were good.	Ariko nta n'umwe muri twe wari mwiza.
I saw something	Nabonye ikintu
That's what he did.	Nibyo yakoze.
He is behind you now.	Ari inyuma yawe ubu.
I never liked this	Sinigeze nkunda ibi
He did not hear.	Ntabwo yumvise.
He watched with the film.	Yarebye hamwe na firime.
I can wait now.	Nshobora gutegereza nonaha.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
Baby.	Umwana.
I feel nothing	Ntacyo numva
Stop making money.	Reka gushaka amafaranga.
I didn't know what to do or say	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo gukora cyangwa kuvuga
And so far, so good.	Kandi kugeza ubu, ni byiza cyane.
New schedule.	Gahunda nshya.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Niki.	Niki.
I thought so	Nari natekereje ko aribyo
I was going to get some time alone	Nari ngiye kubona umwanya wenyine
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
He is ready.	Yiteguye.
And we have.	Kandi dufite.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
I just need to talk to you	Nkeneye gusa kuvugana nawe
This is definitely better than doing something.	Ibi rwose nibyiza kuruta gukora ikintu.
I am the same.	Nanjye ni kimwe.
He had.	Yari afite.
I was going in front of me	Nari ngiye imbere yanjye
I have a lot to say.	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
I mean and it is.	Ndashaka kuvuga kandi ni.
He began to know the same thing.	Yatangiye kumenya ikintu kimwe.
I saw what happened	Nabonye uko byagenze
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Who can tell me what he meant?	Ninde ushobora kumbwira icyo yashakaga kuvuga neza?.
There is currently no problem returning.	Kuri ubu nta kibazo cyo gutaha.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Not you either.	Ntabwo nawe.
I can't go back	Ntabwo nshobora gusubira inyuma
It was my day.	Wari umunsi wanjye.
He doesn’t want what he saw there.	Ntabwo yifuza ibyo yabonye aho.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
I think we have a problem	Ntekereza ko dufite ikibazo
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
I didn’t hear anyone when we were upstairs	Nta muntu numvise mugihe twari hejuru
You don't have to hear anything.	Ntugomba kumva ikintu na kimwe.
I wanted to do the same in a short time.	Nashakaga gukora kimwe mugihe gito.
I need to think clearly	Nkeneye gutekereza neza
I have a lot of luck.	Mfite amahirwe menshi.
He is a child like me.	Ni umwana we nkanjye.
But where people were.	Ariko aho abantu bari.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
But it worked.	Ariko byagenze neza.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
I was lucky today.	Uyu munsi nagize amahirwe.
I really heard swimming	Numvise rwose koga
I knew that	Nari nzi ko aribyo
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
This is definitely possible.	Ibi rwose birashoboka.
That's good right now.	Nibyiza kuri ubu.
I said I knew nothing	Nagize ngo ntacyo nzi
But not everything is easy.	Ariko ibintu byose ntabwo byoroshye.
It's not difficult at all.	Ntabwo bigoye na gato.
She feels like a child.	Yumva ari umwana.
I could never get far	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kuva kure
I really appreciate the help	Nishimiye ubufasha cyane
Ninde.	Ninde.
I don't know how long it has been.	Sinzi igihe yamaze.
Looking forward, not backwards.	Kureba imbere, ntabwo inyuma.
I have a job to do.	Mfite akazi nkora.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
Just problems.	Gusa ibibazo.
But that is not the case.	Ariko si byo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, iyi ni murugo ubu.
And it's fast.	Kandi ni vuba.
I want to have a family.	Ndashaka kugira umuryango.
I need to try again.	Nkeneye kongera kugerageza.
I was well aware	Nari nzi neza
I was very young at the time	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane
I was really excited to do something at the time	Nari nishimiye rwose gukora ikintu icyo gihe
And he is right.	Kandi afite ukuri.
I did not know	Ntabwo nari nzi
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I'm not happy about the job	Ntabwo nishimiye akazi
That is not a good time.	Icyo ntabwo ari igihe cyiza.
I am not human.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu.
I was right.	Nagize ukuri.
I need to do it right	Nkeneye kubikora neza
She was just a girl at the time.	Icyo gihe yari umukobwa gusa.
It's a bad time.	Ni igihe kibi.
Here I am.	Hano na njye.
But it could have been.	Ariko yashoboraga kuba.
He could do nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga gukora.
After all, that’s the idea of ​​experimenting.	Nyuma ya byose, icyo ni igitekerezo cyo kugerageza.
Just one more thing to try.	Gusa ikintu kimwe cyo kugerageza.
I think it worked	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza
You know how it can be.	Uzi uko ashobora kuba.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza
He is very human.	Ni umuntu cyane.
I did something very difficult	Nakoze ibintu bigoye cyane
He was human. 	Yari umuntu. 
To say what he says	Kuvuga icyo avuga
I guess we are.	Ndakeka yuko turi.
I have a lot of problems.	Mfite ibibazo byinshi.
I think you have a good idea	Ntekereza ko ufite igitekerezo cyiza
He saw the problem as a problem.	Yabonye ko ikibazo ari ikibazo.
The inside was.	Imbere yari.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
On the phone.	Na terefone.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
I can hear nothing	Ntacyo nshobora kumva
However, there is something else.	Ariko, hariho ikindi kintu.
I have to be something	Ngomba kuba ikintu
But this.	Ariko ibi.
I need time to think	Nkeneye igihe cyo gutekereza
It was not for me.	Ntabwo byari kuri njye.
I want it here now	Ndashaka ko aha nonaha
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
I was a little girl	Nari umukobwa muto
I think he wanted to do something good.	Ntekereza ko yashakaga gukora ikintu cyiza.
I didn’t think he was	Sinatekerezaga ko ari we
I know he will	Nzi ko azabikora
That's right.	Nukuri.
I thought about what you said inside that room	Natekereje kubyo wavuze imbere muri icyo cyumba
You know the guy is bad.	Uziko umusore ari mubi.
You have to take the time.	Ugomba gufata igihe.
Wisdom and good are not the same.	Ubwenge nibyiza ntabwo ari kimwe.
It's a dog.	Imbwa ni.
He was now on top of her.	Kuri ubu yari hejuru ye.
He is at school.	Ari ku ishuri.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He can't talk to her.	Ntashobora kuvugana na we.
There is a lot to come.	Hariho byinshi byo kuza.
There is only me.	Hariho njye gusa.
The best we can do.	Nibyiza dushobora gukora.
Can you think of anything else ?.	Urashobora gutekereza ikindi kintu cyose?.
I didn't want to do that	Sinifuzaga kubikora
Now we can't wait any longer.	Ubu ntidushobora gutegereza ikindi gihe.
I was here for a while.	Nari hano hano igihe gito.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo agomba kuvuga.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
It was just this.	Byari ibi gusa.
I never wanted to go	Sinigeze nshaka kugenda
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
I know when you have it	Nzi igihe ufite
I have a lot of problems	Mfite ibibazo byinshi
I was just going to eat	Nari ngiye kujya kurya gusa
Everything is fine.	Hariho ibintu byose neza.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
There is a good chance that this will happen.	Birashoboka ko hari amahirwe menshi yo kubikora.
I like to do things	Nkunda gukora ibintu
I think it would be nice	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I'm not far away.	Ntabwo ndi kure.
I can't think of anything else to do	Sinshobora gutekereza gukora ikindi kintu
I hope it will be better to go now	Nizera ko bizaba byiza kugenda ubu
There is so much to see.	Hari byinshi byo kubona.
I have nothing wrong.	Nta kibi mfite.
It was a day.	Wari umunsi.
I have it here	Mfite hano
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira icyo utekereza.
I needed to know for sure, whatever	Nari nkeneye kumenya neza, ibyo aribyo byose
She is very embarrassed.	Afite isoni nyinshi.
That will not be the case in this case.	Ibyo ntabwo bizaba muri iyi.
I just mean living together	Ndashaka kuvuga kubana gusa
He gave it all day.	Yahaye umunsi wose.
I wanted to try an idea.	Nashakaga kugerageza igitekerezo.
Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
I thought it was true.	Natekereje ko ari ukuri.
Not at the moment.	Ntabwo ari kuri iki gihe.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
That was a long way off.	Ibyo byari kure cyane.
Travel time.	Igihe cyo kugenda.
But you really don't.	Ariko ntabwo mubyukuri ukora.
I didn't know you were here	Sinari nzi ko uri hano
That would be us.	Ibyo byari kuba ari twe.
I was afraid it was too much	Nagize ubwoba ko ari byinshi
Doing anything else.	Gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Something went wrong.	Hariho amakosa.
I didn’t want to think that way.	Sinifuzaga gutekereza gutya.
I don't want to talk about that.	Sinshaka kuvuga kuri ibyo.
I just knew it was so good	Nari nzi gusa ko ari byiza cyane
I saw no one	Nta muntu n'umwe nabonye
I'm on top of him.	Ndi hejuru ye.
He can't get money.	Ntashobora kubona amafaranga.
He lives here.	Aba hano.
I think he started drinking there	Ntekereza ko yatangiye kunywa aho
I was really scared	Nari mfite ubwoba rwose
You have to.	Ugomba.
I don't know how he does it	Ntabwo nzi uko abikora
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
I like good things	Nkunda ibintu byiza
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
Everything was up and down.	Ibintu byose byari hejuru no hejuru.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But someone did it.	Ariko hari umuntu wabikoze.
I think there is a good idea	Ntekereza ko hari igitekerezo cyiza
I knew he was worried	Nari nzi ko afite impungenge
Looks bad today.	Birasa nabi muri iki gihe.
Great time.	Igihe cyiza cyane.
I know what you mean	Nzi aho ushaka kuvuga
I have to work.	Ngomba gukora.
But, why.	Ariko, impamvu.
I just want to be close to you	Ndashaka gusa kuba hafi yawe
I doubt it would be good	Ndashidikanya ko byaba byiza
I did a job.	Nakoze akazi.
I feel waiting, waiting	Ndumva gutegereza, gutegereza
I trust everyone here.	Nizera abantu bose hano.
I got help.	Nabonye ubufasha.
But then he knows who he is.	Ariko icyo gihe aba azi uwo ari we.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
The woman was what she needed	Umugore nibyo yari akeneye
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, agomba kuba.
I didn’t really want to stay here	Sinifuzaga kuguma hano rwose
He must be doing well.	Agomba kuba akora neza.
But it will be all day long before he lives here.	Ariko bizaba umunsi wose mbere yuko aba hano.
I feel close	Ndumva turi hafi ya
He can't help anyone.	Ntashobora gufasha umuntu uwo ari we wese.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was good to play	Byari byiza gukina
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
Great to read.	Nibyiza cyane gusoma.
As it happened.	Nkuko byagenze.
I never told anyone I knew	Ntabwo nigeze mbwira umuntu uzi
Playing outside.	Gukina hanze.
I am a woman.	Ndi umugore.
I saw what you saw	Nabonye ibyo wabonye
All of this is possible.	Ibi byose birashoboka.
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu
I wanted to know	Nashakaga kumenya
He did not know exactly why.	Ntabwo yari azi neza impamvu.
I have a good idea now	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza ubu
His dog.	Imbwa ye.
I hope we can do that	Nizera ko dushobora kubikora
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
He was a person who could be good.	Yari umuntu ushobora kuba mwiza.
Tonight he would have a problem.	Iri joro yaba afite ikibazo.
The last thing he needed to do now was fear.	Ikintu cya nyuma yari akeneye gukora ubu ni ubwoba.
I didn't do what he said	Ntabwo nakoze ibyo avuga
It was really nice to watch.	Kureba byari byiza rwose.
I know he would have known	Nzi ko yari kumenya
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo.
But he was ready.	Ariko yari yiteguye.
You are very close now.	Ubu uri hafi cyane.
I never wanted to	Sinigeze nshaka na gato
I worked on it.	Nakoze kuri yo.
He didn’t want a lot of people.	Ntiyashakaga abantu benshi.
I was well aware that man was a woman	Nari nzi neza ko umuntu yari umugore
I had a lot of problems	Nari mfite ibibazo byinshi
I don't know what to do	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora
He seemed to have it.	Yasaga naho afite.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu rwose.
I can't find good friends	Ntabwo nshobora kubona inshuti nziza
I haven't heard or seen anyone	Nta muntu numvise cyangwa nabonye
He left early in the morning	Yagiye kare mu gitondo
He hadn't tried.	Ntabwo yari yagerageje.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
We have to get out of here.	Tugomba kuva hano.
I thought he would do it	Natekereje ko azabikora
Stop being.	Reka kuba.
I never felt that we were really.	Sinigeze numva ko turi mubyukuri.
I would do it.	Nari kubikora.
I am doing well now.	Ubu ndimo gukora neza.
And this.	Kandi ibi.
This is the current one.	Uyu niwe uri ubu.
He could see nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga kubona.
I just didn't see it	Gusa sinigeze mbona
I feel the moment	Ndumva umwanya urimo
We have to do it together.	Tugomba kubikora hamwe.
You can't figure out why.	Ntushobora kumenya impamvu.
I can't say much. 	Sinshobora kuvuga cyane. 
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
And he didn't want to do that.	Kandi ntiyashakaga kubikora.
I really mean to go.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose kugenda.
I don't believe in luck.	Ntabwo nizera amahirwe.
I didn't want to talk to him	Sinifuzaga kuvugana na we
We can't say.	Ntabwo dushobora kuvuga.
They were all down.	Bose bari hasi.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I knew why he did it	Nari nzi impamvu yabikoze
There are problems here.	Hano hari ibibazo.
The less time they had, the better.	Umwanya muto bari bafite, nibyiza.
He would not say.	Ntabwo yari kuvuga.
I am.	Ni njye.
I was human and something else	Nari umuntu kandi ikindi kintu
Your luck, luck to me.	Amahirwe yawe, amahirwe kuri njye.
He and she.	We na we.
I didn't know he had	Sinari nzi ko afite
It was great too.	Byari byiza cyane kandi.
I was not	Ntabwo nari ndimo
No need to work.	Nta mpamvu yo gukora.
Let the questions go.	Reka reka ibibazo.
But that is not all.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo gusa.
I thought a lot.	Natekerezaga cyane.
Especially my family.	Cyane cyane umuryango wanjye.
I don't know what to do	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora
I want to do something with you	Ndashaka gukora ikintu nawe
I wanted to help	Nashakaga gufasha
I guess that's right	Ndakeka ko aribyo rwose
He did not want this.	Ntabwo yari yashakaga ibi.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
I thought he was	Natekerezaga ko ari we
I can't have this in my house	Sinshobora kugira ibi mu nzu yanjye
I can't see why you want to do this.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona impamvu ushaka gukora ibi.
I am not human	Ntabwo ndi umuntu
It is not his children.	Ntabwo ari abana be.
He wants to be something.	Ashaka kuba ikintu.
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
After all, he was my friend.	Nyuma ya byose, yari inshuti yanjye.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
I know a little kid	Nzi umwana muto
Well, you can't even read this.	Nibyiza, ntushobora no gusoma ibi.
I saw nothing wrong	Nta kibi nabonye
The truth is, it is possible.	Ukuri nuko, birashoboka.
I love both	Nkunda bombi
I'm not sure what to do or say	Sinzi neza icyo gukora cyangwa kuvuga
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He makes it clear what everyone wants to hear.	Avuga neza ibyo buri wese ashaka kumva.
He knew exactly what he wanted	Yari azi neza icyo ashaka
I don't believe anyone.	Nta muntu nizera.
I am in you and you are in me	Ndi muri wowe kandi nawe uri muri njye
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
You are friends here.	Muri inshuti hano.
I have never heard of anyone with that problem.	Sinigeze numva umuntu ufite icyo kibazo.
I think you are who you are	Ntekereza ko uri uwo uri we
Great time	Igihe cyiza cyane
I thought of many good things	Natekereje ku byiza byinshi
I have the truth in one.	Mfite ukuri muri umwe.
A wonderful gift.	Impano nziza cyane.
I know you're scared.	Nzi ko ufite ubwoba.
I didn't see it coming.	Ntabwo nabonye kuza.
And that man is us.	Kandi ko umuntu ari twe.
I can't go back now	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma ubu
I didn't know how to do it	Ntabwo nari nzi uburyo bwo kubikora
I know it will happen soon	Nzi ko bizaba vuba
I was sure he had a bad family	Nari nzi neza ko afite umuryango mubi
I have this problem recently	Mfite iki kibazo vuba aha
And you can't have it.	Kandi ntushobora kugira.
You have nothing.	Ntacyo ufite.
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
He knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi.
But then.	Ariko icyo gihe.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I am very happy	Nishimiye cyane
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
He was young and young.	Yari akiri muto kandi muto.
Easy to navigate.	Kugenda byoroshye.
We have things to do.	Dufite ibintu tugomba gukora.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
I'm really sorry	Mbabajwe rwose nibyo
Tell me.	Mbwira.
It was a great gift.	Byari impano nziza.
I have a daughter.	Mfite umukobwa.
Anyone could do that.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kubikora.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
No one would hear.	Nta n'umwe yari kumva.
I really should go home.	Nkwiye rwose gutaha.
And it worked.	Kandi byagenze neza.
I have to think about what you said	Ngomba gutekereza kubyo wavuze
But I felt it was better to do something.	Ariko numvise ari byiza kugira icyo ukora.
He also said that.	Yavuze kandi ko.
But it was good to have a family together.	Ariko byari byiza kugira umuryango hamwe.
This is just money.	Ubu ni amafaranga gusa.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
Isn't that the case? 	Ntabwo aricyo kintu?
I feel ashamed	Numva mfite isoni
Nothing to do at all.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gukora rwose.
There is very little time.	Hariho umwanya muto cyane.
I would do it	Nari kubikora
It would be nice for him.	Byaba byiza kuri we.
Bose.	Bose.
He was not human.	Ntabwo yari umuntu.
Something you need to hear.	Ikintu ukeneye kumva.
Please, let.	Nyamuneka, reka.
I was not sure what to do	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora
I guess that would be my mistake	Ndakeka ko ibyo byaba ari amakosa yanjye
She is a very beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza rwose.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
She was very young and beautiful.	Yari muto cyane kandi mwiza.
All the while, things went well.	Igihe cyose, ibintu byagenze neza.
I am a dog.	Ndi imbwa.
Let go, man.	Reka, muntu.
It was not a chance.	Ntabwo byari amahirwe.
I saw a problem.	Nabonye ikibazo.
I need to know exactly where he is	Nkeneye kumenya neza aho ari
He told me.	Yambwiye.
It's a small issue.	Ni ikibazo gito.
I can't look at anyone	Ntabwo nshobora kureba umuntu
Here's to everyone.	Aha abantu bose.
It's best to do the same.	Nibyiza gukora kimwe.
I think he was ready to go with us.	Ntekereza ko yari yiteguye kujyana natwe.
I can do it all day with you	Nshobora kubikora umunsi wose hamwe nawe
But he was a family.	Ariko yari umuryango.
I needed to know more about him	Nari nkeneye kumenya byinshi kuri we
This is not a person.	Uyu ntabwo ari umuntu.
A player can do this only once.	Umukinnyi arashobora kubikora rimwe gusa.
He finally spoke.	Amaherezo yaje kuvuga.
He has to do everything on his own.	Agomba gukora byose wenyine.
Not so, but it looks good.	Ntabwo ari ibyo, ariko birasa neza.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza
I have to try again.	Ngomba kongera kugerageza.
I didn't know there was much to it	Ntabwo nari nzi ko hari byinshi kuri byo
She wanted to be so beautiful.	Yashakaga kuba mwiza cyane.
Yes, there is a party.	Nibyo, hari ibirori.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
I didn't know what else to do or say	Sinari nzi ikindi gukora cyangwa kuvuga
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
Same as	Kimwe na.
Maybe we should take it one day.	Ahari tugomba gufata umunsi umwe.
For me.	Kuri njye.
And you have to do the same.	Kandi nawe ugomba kubikora.
I don't want to think.	Ntashaka gutekereza.
I needed to think.	Nari nkeneye gutekereza.
I didn’t think it was me	Sinatekerezaga ko ari njye
If he was going to do this, he needed to do it.	Niba agiye gukora ibi, yari akeneye kubikora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I just knew it was	Nari nzi gusa ko ari
It was a house.	Yari inzu.
It is better to stay.	Nibyiza kuguma.
I don't think that would be the case.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko byaba aribyo bigoye cyane.
I have to think.	Ngomba gutekereza.
He knew how to do things.	Yari azi gukora ibintu.
I know where they are.	Nzi aho bari.
I was not going now	Ntabwo nari ngiye ubu
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I knew the truth.	Nari nzi ukuri.
I have to do something.	Ngomba gukora ikintu.
I saw all this	Nabonye ibi byose
Now there is no turning back for him.	Ubu nta gusubira inyuma kuri we.
That everything was true.	Ko byose byari ukuri.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I think he was right	Ntekereza ko yari afite ukuri
I could see nothing.	Ntacyo nari kubona.
I think this was true	Ndakeka ko ibi byari ukuri
I'm not doing well at all.	Ntabwo nkora neza na gato.
I know when he is about to ask for something	Nzi igihe ari hafi gusaba ikintu
I have a lot to catch	Mfite byinshi byo gufata
Maybe there is a chance.	Ahari hari amahirwe.
We are not.	Ntabwo turi.
I am thirty years old	Mfite imyaka mirongo itatu
I can't go far.	Sinshobora kujya kure.
I have to go to work.	Ngomba kujya ku kazi.
I had a problem	Nari mfite ikibazo
I need to go buy clothes later	Nkeneye kujya kugura imyenda nyuma
I didn’t want or need	Ntabwo nashakaga cyangwa nkeneye
Outside.	Hanze.
He said he agreed.	Yavuze ko yemeye.
He is one for me.	Ni umwe kuri njye.
Live well today.	Kubaho neza muri iki gihe.
I have to try and do things right	Ngomba kugerageza no gukora ibintu neza
He thought hard.	Yatekerezaga cyane.
I thought it was you	Natekereje ko ari wowe
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ntashobora, ntashobora, ntashobora.
There are more people than work.	Hariho abantu benshi kuruta akazi.
But she is my daughter.	Ariko ni umukobwa wanjye.
He may not be.	Ashobora kuba atari.
I can't figure out what it is	Sinshobora kumenya icyo aricyo
You know where your son is.	Uzi aho umuhungu wawe ari.
I have faith.	Mfite kwizera.
I didn’t know what to think about what he said.	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza kubyo yavuze.
I must be doing something wrong	Ngomba kuba nkora ikintu kibi
She was a girl.	Yari umukobwa.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
We have to go, far away, from here.	Tugomba kugenda, kure cyane, kuva hano.
It's good enough to stay here.	Nibyiza bihagije kuguma hano.
I can’t wait to see what everyone does	Sinshobora gutegereza kureba icyo buri wese akora
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
In fact, it's really good.	Mubyukuri, ni byiza rwose.
I have a problem.	Mfite ikibazo.
I knew what he was going to do	Nari nzi icyo agiye gukora
The questions are true.	Ibibazo ni ukuri.
He is going.	Agiye.
I didn’t want to tell the truth.	Sinifuzaga kuvuga ukuri.
And that is true.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri.
He had to act quickly.	Yagombaga gukora vuba.
Much to think about	Byinshi byo gutekereza
He wants to win.	Ashaka gutsinda.
I have a plan	Mfite gahunda
It was easy, really.	Byari byoroshye, mubyukuri.
He wants to.	Arashaka.
I have a good idea	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza
Book.	Igitabo.
I saw it, I saw it	Nabonye hafi, hafi kubona
I knew he had done what he thought was best	Nari nzi ko yakoze ibyo yibwiraga ko ari byiza
More than problems.	Kurenza ibibazo.
He was probably his father.	Birashoboka ko yari se.
I like to be outside	Nkunda kuba hanze
The baby is eating.	Umwana arimo kurya.
I really wanted to say	Nashakaga kuvuga rwose
This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
Maybe he thought he was doing something good.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje ko akora ikintu cyiza.
He thought this was not me.	Yatekereje ko uyu atari njye.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
Niki.	Niki.
I was really scared	Nagize ubwoba rwose
Or anyone.	Cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese.
There is probably more.	Birashoboka ko hari byinshi.
I don't know yet	Sinzi uko kugeza ubu
I had no idea	Sinari natekereje
He knew a lot.	Yari azi byinshi.
I can't hear the car	Sinshobora kumva imodoka
Maybe it's just me.	Birashoboka ko ari njye gusa.
There are also advantages.	Hariho n'ibyiza.
He was ready to tell me everything.	Yari yiteguye kumbwira byose.
This movie is great.	Iyi firime ni nziza cyane.
I did not know who he was at the time	Sinari nzi uwo ari we icyo gihe
I feel right.	Numva ari ukuri.
That is the house.	Iyo ni inzu.
He is not a friend.	Ntabwo ari inshuti.
I never heard much about that.	Sinigeze numva byinshi kuri ibyo.
I wanted to get out of here.	Nashakaga kuva hano.
I want one of my own	Ndashaka umwe muri njye
I know you're listening	Nzi ko uri kumva
We were close, everyone.	Twari hafi, abantu bose.
I was not going to come	Ntabwo nari ngiye kuza
At the time I didn’t know the idea.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi igitekerezo.
I think he has an idea there	Ntekereza ko afite igitekerezo aho
You have to.	Ugomba nawe.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I didn't know anything about school	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi ku ishuri
Especially this one.	Cyane cyane iyi.
I can't do that	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora
I have to be at home sometimes	Ngomba kuba murugo rimwe na rimwe
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba ari byiza.
It was great to be with her again.	Byari byiza kongera kubana na we.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
And he was absolutely right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri rwose.
I need to study hard	Nkeneye kwiga cyane
I shouldn't have done that	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora
He has never done that before.	Ntiyigeze abikora mbere.
He probably doesn't know how.	Birashoboka ko atazi uko.
I was very close at the time	Icyo gihe nari hafi cyane
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly	Birashoboka ko ntagomba kuvuga cyane
I really can't wait for that!	Ntabwo rwose nshobora gutegereza ibyo!
A lot of things were normal.	Ibintu byinshi byari ibintu bisanzwe.
I can't do it alone	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora wenyine
He has a wife.	Afite umugore.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
And that is possible.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka.
I have one more thing to say	Mfite ikindi kintu kimwe cyo kuvuga
I thought about this	Natekereje kuri ibi
He was one.	Ni we yari umwe.
I'm glad you're doing well now.	Nishimiye ko ukora neza ubu.
She really needed to get her hair done.	Yari akeneye rwose kubona umusatsi.
It was finally time to leave.	Amaherezo yari igihe cyo kugenda.
It's really good, you know how good it was.	Mubyukuri nibyiza, uzi uko byari byiza.
I have to study.	Ngomba kwiga.
I have a house here.	Mfite inzu hano.
And this is a lot.	Kandi ibi ni byinshi.
I would do a lot of things.	Nari gukora ibintu byinshi.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
It was good though.	Byari byiza ariko.
I knew what he wanted.	Nari nzi icyo ashaka.
I think it's my fault.	Mbwira ko ari amakosa yanjye.
It was just hair.	Byari umusatsi gusa.
And you can't do that.	Kandi ntushobora kubikora.
I want to be your friend	Ndashaka kuba inshuti yawe
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
A good player, too, but he's scared below	Umukinnyi mwiza, nawe, ariko afite ubwoba munsi
I am good with planning.	Ndi mwiza na gahunda.
I want to be here.	Ndashaka kuba hano.
But he needed to know more.	Ariko yari akeneye kumenya byinshi.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, umuhungu yagiye.
There is one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe.
Absolutely wise.	Ubwenge rwose.
When was it.	Ryari ryari.
It seems difficult.	Asa naho bigoye.
I never saw it clearly.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona neza.
I need to see everything	Nkeneye kubona byose
But his money was gone	Ariko amafaranga ye yari yagiye
I thought he was my friend	Natekereje ko ari inshuti yanjye
There is something very wrong.	Hariho ikintu kibi cyane.
I think he is right	Ndakeka ko afite ukuri
I was not sure what he wanted	Sinari nzi neza icyo ashaka
I just need to talk to you	Nkeneye gusa kuvugana nawe
And that was it.	Kandi ibyo byari byo.
I don't want to do anything.	Sinshaka kugira icyo nkora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I did what you wanted.	Nakoze ibyo ushaka.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I like to be outside	Nkunda kuba hanze
You don't even have to talk to me.	Ntugomba no kuvugana nanjye.
I didn't know what time it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo gihe
I wanted to know the same thing	Nashakaga kumenya ikintu kimwe
And he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Kandi yari azi ko yashakaga kuvuga neza.
I needed to stop	Nari nkeneye guhagarika
I think you can wait a while	Ntekereza ko ushobora gutegereza igihe gito
You know everything.	Uzi icyo aricyo cyose.
That's not really the case.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
I see no one after him.	Nta muntu mbona nyuma ye.
It’s a matter of watching.	Ni ikibazo cyo kureba.
On that day.	Kuri uwo munsi.
It's his money.	Ni amafaranga ye.
I think he would drink	Ndatekereza ko yari kunywa
It's too high.	Ni hejuru cyane.
I was not embarrassed or scared	Ntabwo nagize isoni cyangwa ubwoba
I didn’t want him to go	Sinifuzaga ko agenda
I knew it was a book.	Nari nzi ko ari igitabo.
I only know what you know.	Nzi ibyo uzi gusa.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He didn't hear much, but he could read very well.	Ntiyigeze yumva byinshi, ariko yashoboraga gusoma neza neza.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
I mean, he can help	Ndashaka kuvuga, arashobora gufasha
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza.
Family here.	Umuryango hano.
He would hear nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari kumva.
It's best to go back to work	Nibyiza gusubira ku kazi
Is that really what you want ?.	Nibyo koko nibyo ushaka?.
He had something he didn’t have.	Yari afite ikintu atari afite.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I had a baby.	Nari mfite umwana.
It is not my house, nor my house.	Ntabwo ari inzu yanjye, cyangwa inzu yanjye.
He has nothing.	Nta na kimwe afite.
I wanted to be a teacher	Nashakaga kuba umwarimu
We have.	Dufite.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
I need it today	Nkeneye uyu munsi
From the first day.	Kuva ku munsi wa mbere.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
He would not eat.	Ntabwo yari kurya.
If so, you are lucky.	Niba aribyo, ufite amahirwe.
In fact years were something.	Mubyukuri imyaka yari ikintu.
I didn't hear or hear anything	Ntacyo numvise cyangwa numva ikintu na kimwe
I want to know what he does out here	Ndashaka kumenya icyo akora hanze aha
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
Please, he said.	Nyamuneka, yavuze.
And he had to feel lucky.	Kandi yagombaga kumva afite amahirwe.
I think that's what he said	Ntekereza ko aribyo yavuze
You didn't see it.	Ntabwo wabonye.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
I think you have a lot of talent	Ntekereza ko ufite impano nyinshi
I'm better than that	Ndi mwiza kurenza ibyo
A girl can do very badly	Umukobwa arashobora gukora nabi cyane
I don't know what else to do.	Sinzi ikindi gukora.
I mean, that's the thing	Ndashaka kuvuga ko aricyo kintu
For me, it was really easy.	Kuri njye byari byoroshye rwose kubikora.
He was really into it.	Yari arimo rwose.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
And it looks good.	Kandi birasa neza.
At any time.	Igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
I think he tried to get well	Ntekereza ko yagerageje kuza neza
I need to know what it is	Nkeneye kumenya icyo aricyo
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
He wants to go.	Ashaka kugenda.
I wanted to know more	Nashakaga kumenya neza
I'm glad he had the opportunity to talk to you.	Nishimiye ko yagize amahirwe yo kuvugana nawe.
I need to be in a better film than this	Nkeneye kuba muri firime nziza kurenza iyi
Niki! 	Niki!
Anyway.	Nigute.
He needed help.	Yari akeneye ubufasha.
I saw that	Nabonye ko
I guess he can't say anything	Ndakeka ko ntacyo ashobora kuvuga
I need to talk to someone.	Nkeneye kuvugana numuntu.
Or maybe they have.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko bafite.
I want to live well.	Ndashaka kubana neza.
It seems hard but it is not.	Birasa naho bigoye ariko sibyo.
I never wanted one of those	Sinigeze nshaka na kimwe muri ibyo
It's not just about school or living together.	Ntabwo ari mwishuri gusa cyangwa kubana.
I don’t think it’s good to do that.	Ntabwo mbona ko ari byiza kubikora.
I need to go home	Nkeneye gusubira murugo
I'm not a bad person.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu mubi.
I have so many.	Mfite benshi cyane.
Why? 	Kuki?
He didn't have to be here.	Ntabwo yagombaga kuba hano.
I mean we were friends but we weren’t close.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko twari inshuti ariko ntabwo turi hafi.
He knew where he was.	Yari azi aho yari ari.
I was going.	Nari ngiye.
I guess, if that's what you want	Ndakeka yuko, niba aribyo ushaka
You have to.	Ugomba.
You don't have to look far.	Ntugomba kureba kure.
He talked about anything.	Yavuze ku kintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I'm glad everything went well	Nishimiye ko ibintu byose byagenze neza
And you know very well.	Kandi uzi ubwenge cyane.
He was the only one who did it.	Ni we wenyine wabikoze.
I should have done something	Nari nkwiye kugira icyo nkora
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Or if it is, what he means.	Cyangwa niba ari, icyo ashaka kuvuga.
I'm glad to be in this	Nishimiye kuba muri ibi
No house.	Nta nzu.
He never said a word.	Nta kibazo yigeze avuga.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It is not a way of life.	Ntabwo ari uburyo bwo kubaho.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo aribyo.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
The most beautiful girl of my age	Umukobwa mwiza cyane imyaka yanjye gusa
Did you know that there is.	Wari uziko ahari.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nuko yari afite ukuri.
I think it's good for that	Ntekereza ko ari byiza kuri byo
That's not what you think.	Ntabwo aribyo utekereza neza.
This looks bad.	Ibi birasa nabi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
He never felt he wanted to talk to anyone.	Ntiyigeze yumva ashaka kuvugana n'umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I had a very bad idea	Nari natekereje nabi cyane
It was true, almost.	Byari ukuri, hafi.
He needed to see that problem.	Yari akeneye kubona icyo kibazo.
I understand the idea	Ndumva igitekerezo
I'm sure you've seen this	Nzi neza ko wabonye ibi
I know a lot of people	Nzi abantu benshi
I really want to try this one !.	Ndashaka rwose kugerageza iyi!.
She was not his wife.	Ntabwo yari umugore we.
If we can do that, you can too.	Niba dushobora kubikora, nawe urashobora.
I should have gone	Nari nkwiye kugenda
Good to see.	Nibyiza kureba.
I was not going to wait	Ntabwo nari ngiye gutegereza
All of this is true.	Ibi byose ni ukuri.
I know exactly where they are	Nzi neza aho bari
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
The shortest time we have here.	Igihe gito cyane dufite hano.
And for us.	Kandi kuri twe.
There's a lot going on here.	Hano hari byinshi inyuma.
I didn't want to be around him	Sinifuzaga kuba hafi ye
You can try that.	Urashobora kugerageza ibyo.
It's not your money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga yawe.
No attempt.	Nta kugerageza.
I didn't know you were so far away	Sinari nzi ko uri kure cyane
I thought about going	Natekereje kugenda
But he is a good child.	Ariko ni umwana mwiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
At the time, I knew the truth	Icyo gihe nari nzi ukuri
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
Someone you need to know.	Umuntu ukeneye kumenya.
He needed to talk.	Yari akeneye kuvuga.
Not even on this.	Ntabwo ari no kuri ibi.
I want to know what you think	Ndashaka kumenya icyo utekereza
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
I love everything	Nkunda byose
I know enough to do it	Nzi bihagije kubikora
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
You have a lot in front of you.	Ufite byinshi imbere yawe.
I have to try something	Ngomba kugerageza ikintu
I didn't get the chance	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe
There is a catch.	Hariho gufata.
I am doing well.	Nkora neza.
None of this I do	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo nkora
I didn't know what to think or what to believe	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza cyangwa icyo nizera
From his house.	Kuva mu nzu ye.
I know that is true	Nzi ko ibyo aribyo
One.	Umwe.
And that was true.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri.
If not here's a new product just for you!	Niba atari ahari, yagize ikibazo.
But as usual, it is not.	Ariko nkuko bisanzwe, ntabwo aribyo.
I don't know where he is	Sinzi aho ari
What he means.	Kuba icyo ashaka kuvuga.
That's not the case today.	Ntabwo aribyo uyu munsi.
But that's enough.	Ariko bihagije kubyo aribyo.
He took first place another week	Yafashe umwanya wa mbere ikindi cyumweru
You are doing well.	Urimo kugenda neza.
He was his young man.	Yari umusore we.
You don’t have the right opportunity right now.	Ntabwo ufite amahirwe akwiye nonaha.
I can't figure out the problem	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya ikibazo
This was really good.	Ibi byari byiza rwose.
That is especially true today.	Ibyo ni ukuri cyane cyane muri iki gihe.
I wonder if this is the case	Ndabaza niba ibi aribyo
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He is a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza.
I mean, just talk	Ndashaka kuvuga, kuvuga gusa
He knows his car.	Azi imodoka ye.
I just need time to do this	Nkeneye gusa umwanya wo gukora ibi
Not now, and not later.	Ntabwo ari ubu, kandi si nyuma.
He is telling the truth. '	Avuga ukuri '.
For him they were not.	Kuri we ntabwo bari.
Quit.	Kureka.
You need to know.	Ugomba kumenya.
It's not the same thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe.
He was not alone in being alone.	Ntiyari wenyine mu kuba wenyine.
He was in front of me.	Yari imbere yanjye.
I needed to take a closer look	Nari nkeneye kureba neza
I was worried	Nabonye impungenge
Trying to figure out why.	Kugerageza kumenya impamvu.
He knows nothing.	Ntacyo azi.
He wanted more.	Yashakaga byinshi.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
It was hard to know anything.	Byari bigoye kumenya ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I'm glad to be close to him	Nishimiye kuba hafi ye
He thought the idea was good.	Yatekereje ko igitekerezo ari cyiza.
I didn't know how to ask for help	Sinari nzi gusaba ubufasha
I know a guy now	Nzi umusore ubu
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
You want	Urashaka.
Or on the bus.	Cyangwa muri bisi.
I love the house	Nkunda inzu
They were both one.	Bombi bari umwe.
I just want wisdom	Ndashaka ubwenge gusa
I want to do this as he does	Ndashaka gukora ibi nkuko abikora
I was just thinking of one thing	Natekerezaga gusa ikintu kimwe
I mean, everyone.	Ndashaka kuvuga, buri wese.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
I think he just needs time	Ntekereza ko akeneye igihe gusa
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
I am, after all, just one	Ndi, nyuma ya byose, umwe gusa
I hope it will be fine	Ndizera ko bizaba byiza
I am one and the same	Ndi umwe kandi nawe
He thought it was something.	Yatekereje ko ari ibintu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He told me that.	Yambwiye ibyo.
At the time, there was not much to say.	Icyo gihe, nta byinshi byo kuvuga.
I need money today.	Nkeneye amafaranga uyu munsi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I never saw a baby.	Sinigeze mbona umwana.
Great to read.	Nibyiza cyane gusoma.
I saw it soon	Nabonye vuba vuba
But obviously there is someone at home.	Ariko biragaragara ko murugo hari umuntu.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I think that is absolutely possible	Ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka rwose
Tell me.	Mbwira.
But that’s what you have to do.	Ariko ibyo nibyo ugomba gukora.
I just want to help people	Ndashaka gufasha abantu gusa
No moving forward.	Nta kugenda imbere.
I should have seen.	Nari nkwiye kubona.
He was a good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza.
He says you can go home.	Avuga ko ushobora gutaha.
I'm sure that's it	Nzi neza ko aribyo
I'm scared, really.	Mfite ubwoba, mubyukuri.
Question.	Ikibazo.
I have friends there	Mfite inshuti aho
It's a long way off.	Ni kure cyane kubona byinshi.
Anything to live for.	Ikintu cyose cyo kubaho.
I knew nothing about him or him	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri we cyangwa kuri we
He had to do it.	Yagombaga kubikora.
And for no reason.	Kandi nta mpamvu.
He would have none.	Ntabwo yari kugira na gato.
Whatever you need !.	Icyo ukeneye cyose!.
I only have the first thing	Mfite ikintu cya mbere gusa
I heard that.	Numvise aho.
We have to go now.	Tugomba kugenda ubu.
I just want him to say what he knows	Gusa ndashaka ko avuga ibyo azi
He will be close.	Azaba hafi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I'm not good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza.
You can't take things for granted.	Ntushobora gufata ibintu.
I was really good	Nari mwiza rwose
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I saw nothing	Nta na kimwe nabonye
Not good, maybe.	Ntabwo ari byiza, birashoboka.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikibazo kinini.
I was moving forward	Nari ngiye imbere
I can't tell anyone	Ntabwo nshobora kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese
I want to know more about him	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi kuri we
I like the problem	Nkunda ikibazo
You are a good person.	Uri umuntu mwiza.
He was here today.	Uyu munsi yari hano.
I have something good to do.	Mfite ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
At that time he would be alone.	Icyo gihe yari kuba wenyine.
We were actually.	Twari mubyukuri.
Every little thing.	Buri kintu gito.
I really thought we could do it.	Natekerezaga rwose ko dushobora kubikora.
I didn’t know what to think or do	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza cyangwa gukora
I only did it once.	Nigeze kubikora rimwe gusa.
I want to be with you	Ndashaka kubana nawe
Just the way things are later.	Gusa uko ibintu byagenze nyuma.
I heard walking outside	Numvise kugenda hanze
I think he is afraid to do it alone	Ntekereza ko afite ubwoba bwo kubikora wenyine
I would do it soon	Nari kubikora vuba aha
I have a reason.	Mfite impamvu.
But he was just a man.	Ariko uwo yari umuntu gusa.
In fact, however, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
There is a truth.	Hariho ukuri.
More and more.	Byinshi kandi byinshi.
He must also know everything.	Agomba kandi kumenya byose.
I was very good at it	Nari mwiza cyane muri byo
You can't see.	Ntushobora kubona.
That's what he said.	Nibyo yavuze.
I wanted to say things	Nashakaga kuvuga ibintu
I had time.	Nagize igihe.
I am very worried about this.	Mfite impungenge cyane kuri ibi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I know everyone.	Nzi abantu bose.
But he is good to me.	Ariko niwe mwiza kuri njye.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
While we are here.	Mugihe turi hano.
Not just this morning.	Ntabwo ari muri iki gitondo gusa.
He will be there.	Azaba ahari.
I can't find a job.	Sinshobora kubona akazi.
He has a favorite.	Afite ibyo akunda.
Everything.	Byose.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga.
He saw things he should not see.	Yabonye ibintu atagomba kubona.
When he was his age.	Iyo yari imyaka ye.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
I think you have a problem.	Ntekereza ko ufite ikibazo.
But it was not for me.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuri njye.
I knew it was good to be here	Nari nzi ko ari byiza kuza hano
They have a plan.	Bafite gahunda.
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi.
I wonder what else he knows	Ndabaza ikindi azi
Being here.	Kuba hano.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
I didn't know that was possible	Sinari nzi ko ibyo bishoboka
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
I think he has problems.	Ntekereza ko afite ibibazo.
Only.	Gusa.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
I want to help your son	Ndashaka gufasha umuhungu wawe
We didn’t have many plans.	Ntabwo twari dufite gahunda nyinshi.
I guess he wanted more of it	Ndakeka ko yashakaga byinshi muri byo
I needed to know better	Nari nkeneye kumenya neza
He went a long way.	Yagiye cyane.
There are a lot of difficult questions.	Hariho ibibazo byinshi bigoye.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
Everyone was down.	Abantu bose bari hasi.
You love where you are.	Ukunda aho uri.
I thought about what he said, and it was true	Natekereje kubyo yavuze, kandi byari ukuri
He just thought it was good.	Yatekereje gusa ko aribyo byiza.
I think they are close	Ntekereza ko bari hafi
Apparently he did.	Biragaragara ko yabikoze.
I enjoyed reading today.	Nishimiye gusoma uyu munsi.
It is possible that he never heard of it.	Birashoboka cyane ko atigeze yumva.
He needed to drink.	Yari akeneye kunywa.
I needed to go.	Nari nkeneye kugenda.
All right.	Byose byiza.
That's all there is to it.	Ibyo byose ni ikintu.
I thought we had a house, you and I	Natekereje ko dufite inzu, wowe na njye
Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
I couldn't figure out why	Sinigeze nshobora kumenya impamvu
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
I know what it is	Nzi icyo aricyo
There is one.	Hariho umwe.
I hope it's good	Ndizera ko ari byiza
It's easy, but it's obvious.	Byoroshye, ariko biragaragara.
I never understood how that happened	Sinigeze numva uburyo ibyo byagenze
It will not be.	Ntabwo bizaba.
Not at this time.	Ntabwo ari iki gihe.
He had to do it alone.	Yagombaga kubikora wenyine.
I heard everything in that room	Numvise ibintu byose muri icyo cyumba
I thought he was scared	Natekereje ko afite ubwoba
You are watching carefully.	Urimo kureba neza.
I needed to try	Nari nkeneye kugerageza
It was really an opportunity to see.	Mubyukuri byari amahirwe yo kubona.
I knew it was a bad idea	Nari nzi ko ari igitekerezo kibi
I had the same thing	Nari mfite ikintu kimwe
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka kuba hano.
His time.	Igihe cye.
I had a lot to live for	Nari mfite byinshi byo kubaho
And no one ever did.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
No one is out now.	Nta muntu ubu uri hanze.
I also want to be your friend	Ndashaka no kuba inshuti yawe
We are friends.	Turi inshuti.
I didn’t have a chance to buy something yesterday	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe yo kugura ikintu ejo
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
He can go, he can't.	Ashobora kugenda, ntashobora.
I think he had something.	Ntekereza ko hari ikintu yari afite.
I never thought I could do enough	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ko nshobora gukora bihagije
But he is not.	Ariko we sibyo.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
I wanted both	Nashakaga bombi
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira byinshi kuri ibyo.
I know you're out	Nzi ko uri hanze
No one works here.	Nta muntu ukora hano.
I have to be in you	Ngomba kuba muri wowe
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
Mistakes or not.	Amakosa cyangwa ntabwo.
Everyone has a reason.	Buri wese afite impamvu.
We needed a lot of time.	Twari dukeneye igihe kinini.
It was good for me.	Kuri njye byari byiza.
I want to do that	Ndashaka kubikora gutya
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
All is well.	Byose nibyiza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
He was alone, as before.	Yari wenyine, nka mbere.
He is not the same guy.	Ntabwo ari umusore umwe.
He must have.	Agomba kugira.
We really should.	Tugomba rwose.
Or maybe it's not.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byo.
I need something	Nkeneye ikintu
I think there is something	Ntekereza ko hari ikintu cyose
He does what he says.	Akora ibyo avuga.
It is for us and for us.	Ni kuri twe no kuri twe.
This is a good thing.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza.
What to do ?.	Icyo gukora?.
But you can try.	Ariko urashobora kugerageza.
I like to eat a lot.	Nkunda kurya byinshi.
No one did it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
It was good for us.	Byari byiza kuri twe.
When that.	Iyo ibyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I saw something	Nabonye ikintu
I know you have to have problems	Nzi ko ugomba kuba ufite ibibazo
I didn't think that was possible	Ntabwo natekerezaga ko ibyo bishoboka
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
They are not children.	Ntabwo ari abana.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
I actually work all the time	Mubyukuri nkora igihe cyose
It was definitely a problem for me	Rwose byari ikibazo kuri njye
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I just didn't know why.	Gusa sinari nzi neza impamvu.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Sinari nzi icyo agiye gukora
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I hope this is a good thing.	Nizera ko iki ari ikintu cyiza.
You have to be like me.	Ugomba kuba nkanjye.
You are on your schedule.	Uri kuri gahunda yawe.
I really need to go home	Nkeneye gutaha mubyukuri
Or something else.	Cyangwa ikindi.
I want to know everything about him	Ndashaka kumenya byose kuri we
I mean really today	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri iki gihe
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
I can't see how we can help that	Sinshobora kubona uko dushobora gufasha muri ibyo
There is only one thing to drive here.	Hano hari ikintu cyo gutwara gusa.
I am grateful for the help	Nishimiye ubufasha
I was on the same issue	Nanjye nari kuri icyo kibazo
I heard it all	Numvise byose
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
I know his house.	Nzi inzu ye.
I know what he means	Nzi icyo ashaka kuvuga
I really want to do this	Ndashaka rwose gukora ibi
And very soon.	Kandi vuba cyane.
But that is not what he chose to do.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo yahisemo gukora.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba hano.
I don't know what happened.	Sinzi uko byagenze.
That one person would be me.	Uwo muntu umwe yari kuba njye.
I feel it is a job.	Numva ari akazi.
I didn't know what else to do.	Sinari nzi ikindi gukora.
I saw exactly what he was saying	Nabonye neza ibyo avuga
I hope you can be here	Nizere ko ushobora kuba hano
I did a lot today.	Uyu munsi nakoze byinshi.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
I love it here with you	Nkunda hano hamwe nawe
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I know what happened	Nzi uko byagenze
I think he was young	Ndatekereza ko yari akiri muto
And that should be me.	Kandi uwo agomba kuba njye.
I saw everything	Nabonye ibintu byose
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You can stay.	Urashobora kuguma.
He said he wanted to come.	Yavuze ko yashakaga kuza.
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza
She has my hair.	Afite umusatsi wanjye.
I wanted to know more.	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi.
He is just telling the truth.	Gusa avuga ukuri.
I know everything now.	Nzi byose ubu.
I want to hear everything	Ndashaka kumva byose
I thought we were friends	Natekereje ko turi inshuti
He was really good.	Yari umuhanga rwose.
Much of that would be true and true.	Ibyo byinshi byaba ari ukuri kandi ni ukuri.
They were going to win.	Bari gutsinda.
That was easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye.
I ask how old he is	Ndabaza imyaka afite
His needs were much greater than his needs.	Ibyo yari akeneye byari byinshi cyane kuruta ibyo yari akeneye.
Not really good.	Ntabwo ari byiza rwose.
I don't know what happened.	Sinzi uko byagenze.
From here.	Kuva hano.
We have to figure out how to win first.	Tugomba kumva uburyo bwo gutsinda mbere.
He doesn’t do much.	Ntabwo akora cyane.
You are a good friend.	Muri inshuti nziza.
It's too bad.	Ni mubi cyane.
But it will be.	Ariko bizaba.
I wonder if we can do that	Ndabaza niba dushobora kubikora
I felt scared.	Numvise mfite ubwoba.
Much has gone wrong.	Byinshi byagenze nabi.
Whatever you want to do you can see clearly.	Ikintu cyose ushaka gukora urashobora kubona neza.
You can be bad.	Urashobora kuba mubi.
I like to play house	Nkunda gukina inzu
I can't overcome fear	Sinshobora gutsinda ubwoba
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
It's a good morning.	Hari mu gitondo cyiza.
I knew it then.	Nari nzi icyo gihe.
Too many people at the time.	Abantu benshi cyane icyo gihe.
No one thought.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze atekereza.
I understand what you are looking for	Ndumva icyo urimo gushaka
I am your only daughter.	Ndi umukobwa wawe wenyine.
He doesn't have to come here.	Ntagomba kuza hano.
He probably thought.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje.
Car. 	Imodoka.
'	'
But there is no turning back now.	Ariko nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
I want to do what he wants	Ndashaka gukora ibyo ashaka
We have to go with him.	Tugomba kujyana na we.
is.	ni.
I had no problem with that	Nta kibazo nagize kuri ibyo
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I have to leave for a while.	Ngomba kugenda mugihe gito.
I wanted you to be bad to me.	Nashakaga ko muri njye mubi.
I never thought you could be yourself	Sinatekerezaga rwose ko ushobora kuba wowe
I should have lived with him	Nari nkwiye kubana na we
Everyone wants one.	Umuntu wese arashaka umwe.
That would be a problem.	Byari kuba ikibazo.
I guess you can read	Ndakeka ko ushobora gusoma
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
It will be.	Bizaba.
Normal.	Ibintu bisanzwe.
I needed a teacher	Nari nkeneye umwarimu
I didn't know what to think	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza
This, here.	Ibi, hano.
I have a lot of chances to win.	Mfite amahirwe menshi yo gutsinda.
You don't have to be here alone.	Ntugomba kuba hano wenyine.
I mean, that's right	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri nibyo
I did a lot	Nakoze cyane
What is this.	Ni iki.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
It didn't look like it.	Ntabwo yari uko asa.
We have to do more.	Tugomba gukora byinshi.
I can't believe it's here	Sinshobora kwizera ko ari hano
I found a nice house for her	Nabonye inzu nziza kuri we
I want to have a good friend like her.	Ndashaka kugira inshuti nziza nka we.
This time he would do everything right.	Iki gihe yari gukora byose neza.
I think he feels the same way about me	Ndatekereza ko yumva ibintu kimwe kuri njye
He can tell everyone.	Ashobora kubwira abantu bose.
I wanted to too	Nanjye nashakaga
I'm scared of that	Mfite ubwoba kuri byo
I have so many problems	Mfite ibibazo byinshi cyane
There are people around me.	Hafi yanjye hari abantu.
That may have been the case.	Ibyo birashoboka ko bari bafite.
You do.	Ukora.
I heard no one.	Nta muntu numvise.
He wanted to, however.	Yashakaga ariko.
I mean, it's not his fault	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo ari amakosa ye
It's something.	Ni ikintu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I don’t want to know if it’s good for me.	Sinshaka kumenya niba ari mwiza kuri njye.
I wanted to leave	Nashakaga kuva aho
I really think he is	Ndatekereza rwose ko ari we
I wanted him to say something	Nashakaga ko agira icyo avuga
I'm happy with everything	Nishimiye byose
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
I hope you can do it.	Nizera ko ushobora kubikora.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
There is so much for us.	Hariho byinshi kuri twe.
I feel nothing in front of me	Ntacyo numva imbere yanjye
No one had a lot of money.	Nta muntu wari ufite amafaranga menshi.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
It would not be difficult.	Ntabwo byari kuba bigoye.
I didn't have one either	Nanjye sinari mfite
I didn't want to go	Sinifuzaga kujyana
No one said.	Nta muntu yabwiye.
I never liked this	Sinigeze nkunda ibi
But sometimes, it's not easy.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe, ntabwo byoroshye.
He is very sitting.	Yicaye cyane.
I never thought of leaving my child	Sinigeze ntekereza kureka umwana wanjye
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, yari azi ko atari we.
I want to be close to you	Ndashaka kuba hafi yawe
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
I didn't know how to do it	Ntabwo nari nzi uburyo bwo kubikora
I like the way he speaks	Nkunda uburyo avuga
Only.	Gusa.
That's not a lot.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byinshi.
I'm sure now.	Nzi neza ko ubu.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza neza
I can't take anything	Sinshobora gufata ikintu na kimwe
We need a reason.	Dukeneye impamvu.
Everyone knew who he was.	Abantu bose bari bazi uwo ari we.
It's time.	Ni igihe.
I had a lot to do instead.	Nari mfite byinshi aho kubikora.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
I don't know how to do it.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo bwo kubikora.
I thought to myself	Natekerezaga wenyine
I think it's too far.	Ntekereza ko ari kure cyane.
As of this morning.	Kuva muri iki gitondo.
He is not behind.	Ntabwo ari inyuma.
You saw nothing.	Ntacyo wabonye.
I don’t think that’s a big deal	Ndakeka ko atari igitekerezo kinini
I knew nothing	Ntacyo nari nzi
It looks exactly like me.	Birasa neza neza kuri njye.
With us.	Natwe.
I didn’t have this good	Ntabwo nari mfite ibi byiza
Just me	Ndi njye gusa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko uri hafi kuruta mbere.
Not soon.	Ntabwo ari vuba.
I want to think about this with you	Ndashaka gutekereza kuri ibi nawe
There is always so much.	Buri gihe ni byinshi.

One of the best.	Kimwe mu byiza.
I need to do something.	Nkeneye kugira icyo nkora.
Lots of opportunities	Amahirwe menshi
An idea or plan?	Igitekerezo cyangwa gahunda?
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The two are close.	Aba bombi bari hafi.
I want to talk to you for a long time	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe igihe kirekire
He really wants to talk to you.	Arashaka rwose kuvugana nawe.
I like simple things	Nkunda ibintu byoroshye
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
We have to look ahead.	Tugomba kureba imbere.
I make a movie.	Nkora firime.
It was not your fault.	Ntabwo wari amakosa yawe.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
He was not thinking well.	Ntabwo yari atekereza neza.
But he had done well enough.	Ariko yari amaze kugira neza bihagije.
You did it right.	Wabikoze neza.
I just need to talk to you	Nkeneye gusa kuvugana nawe
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
Tell me soon.	Mbwira vuba.
I don't even know where he is.	Sinzi n'aho ari.
We are a gift.	Ni impano.

Good friends	Inshuti nziza.
I like to have a family	Nkunda kugira umuryango
To the phone.	Kuri terefone.
I need everything	Nkeneye ibintu byose
They are just people and you are.	Ni abantu gusa kandi nawe niwowe.
I really want to see more of this	Ndashaka rwose kureba muri ibi byinshi
Little did I know that we could do it	Sinari nzi ko dushobora kubikora
There is one more thing.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
I want to be with him	Ndashaka kubana na we
She likes to have a wife.	Akunda kugira umugore.
You are very high here.	Uri hejuru cyane hano.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
I just wasn’t human	Gusa ntabwo nari umuntu
Only I never thought of it that way	Gusa ntabwo nigeze ntekereza neza
I don't know what to do about it	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora muri ibyo
Not really me.	Ntabwo ari njye rwose.
I believe in waiting	Nizera mugihe cyo gutegereza
Obviously not now.	Biragaragara ko atari ubu.
Back home.	Gusubira murugo.
I have to take my baby	Ngomba gufata umwana wanjye
Here.	Ibi.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko yabikoze koko.
Just good to get out of here.	Byiza gusa kuva hano.
I wanted to say, but not	Nashakaga kuvuga, ariko sibyo
Once upon a time.	Ryari rimwe.
You have to be small in everything.	Ugomba kuba muto muri byose.
I needed to go for help	Nari nkeneye kujya gushaka ubufasha
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, byagenze neza cyane.
He will do it right.	Azabikora neza.
He would not get it.	Ntabwo yari kubona.
I thought he meant it	Natekereje ko yashakaga kuvuga
It started this week.	Yatangiye kuri iki cyumweru.
I'm happy to help.	Nishimiye gufasha.
It’s not the same as talking in a scared school.	Ntabwo ari kimwe no kuvuga mwishuri ufite ubwoba.
I saw everything wrong	Nabonye ikintu cyose kibi
I'm not sure if that's a bad thing	Sinzi neza niba aricyo kintu kibi
That was not the case at the time.	Ntabwo byari ikintu icyo gihe.
At the moment, no one has an idea.	Kuri ubu, nta muntu ufite igitekerezo.
I can't add more	Ntabwo nshobora kongera byinshi
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
I wanted a family.	Nashakaga umuryango.
Most of the time, he is right.	Igihe kinini, aba afite ukuri.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
Going together.	Kujya hamwe.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ko aribyo rwose
I wanted to talk to you.	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe.
I have to stop doing that	Ngomba kureka gukora ibyo
I was sure that	Nari nzi neza ko
To me, he was just a friend.	Kuri njye, yari inshuti gusa.
None of us.	Nta kintu na kimwe muri twe.
I can't do it alone	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora wenyine
But not now.	Ariko si ubu.
I'm glad you found someone	Nishimiye ko wabonye umuntu
.	.
I really enjoyed being around him	Nishimiye rwose kuba hafi yanjye
We have enough problems.	Dufite ibibazo bihagije.
It is up to us.	Ni kuri twe.
I did not know about this	Ntabwo nari nzi kuri ibi
I was very close	Nari hafi cyane
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
Very nice girl	Umukobwa mwiza cyane.
I want to help people	Ndashaka gufasha abantu
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
I also want to be here	Ndashaka no kuba hano
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He would see nothing.	Ntacyo yari kubona.
I have a lot to do	Mfite byinshi byo gukora
I can't do anything right.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ikintu na kimwe neza.
He could have come home.	Yashoboraga gutaha.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I'm scared of everything.	Mfite ubwoba kuri byose.
She was not a girl.	Ntiyari umukobwa.
He can win.	Ashobora gutsinda.
I want to know everything about him	Ndashaka kumenya byose kuri we
Sometimes it seems to be better.	Rimwe na rimwe birasa nkaho ari byiza kuruta.
He didn't have much to say.	Ntiyari afite byinshi byo kuvuga.
Lots of catch.	Byinshi byo gufata.
I really like what happened.	Nkunda cyane uko byagenze.
I can't get out of everything	Ntabwo nshobora kuva muri byose
There is something you need to see here.	Hano hari ikintu ukeneye kubona.
I just needed to think	Nari nkeneye gutekereza gusa
But good thing.	Ariko ikintu cyiza.
We just need a little time.	Dukeneye gusa umwanya muto.
She has been scared ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe yagize ubwoba.
There is food.	Hariho ibiryo.
She has a young child.	Afite umwana muto.
I'm sorry	Mbabajwe.
It's good that you did it.	Nibyiza ko wabikoze.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
She is not a woman in this world.	Ntabwo ari umugore kuri iyi si.
Maybe we should go.	Ahari tugomba kugenda.
I don’t know if we can survive	Sinzi niba dushobora kubaho
No problem today.	Nta kibazo iki gihe.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
I enjoyed this one.	Nishimiye iyi.
I need to think.	Nkeneye gutekereza.
For me, it’s good.	Kuri njye, ni byiza.
That is not the case with everyone.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri bose.
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
I want something nice.	Ndashaka ikintu cyiza.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
You want to work.	Ushaka gukora.
I needed a lot of time with him	Nari nkeneye igihe kinini hamwe na we
I saw everything I do	Nabonye ibintu byose nkora
I didn't know he was home	Sinari nzi ko ari murugo
I didn't know it was a dog	Sinari nzi ko ari imbwa
There is something for everyone.	Hariho ikintu kuri buri wese.
Lots of food.	Ibiryo byinshi.
Time is of the essence.	Igihe ni igihe.
I'm not sure what.	Sinzi neza icyo.
Bombi.	Bombi.
He must.	Agomba.
I like the way you look	Nkunda uburyo usa
If so.	Niba aribyo.
For him he agreed to stop thinking.	Kuri we yemeye kureka gutekereza.
I'm glad he's leaving	Nishimiye ko agenda
I wanted to be his friend again.	Nashakaga kongera kuba inshuti ye.
I did not know who I believed	Ntabwo nari nzi uwo nizera
All we have is today.	Ibyo dufite byose ni uyu munsi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I think we have enough stuff right now	Ndatekereza ko dufite ibintu bihagije ubu
Maybe one should look into this.	Ahari umuntu agomba kureba muri ibi.
I didn't get the idea.	Ntabwo nabonye igitekerezo.
They would not be lucky.	Ntabwo bari kugira amahirwe.
No one knew he was here.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi ko ari hano.
I doubt it is possible.	Ndashidikanya ko bishoboka.
No stopping is possible.	Nta guhagarika bishoboka.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
Where is he?	Ari he?
I should eat something else	Nkwiye kurya ikindi kintu
I hope he saw my car	Ndizera ko yabonye imodoka yanjye
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He wasn't sure if he could do it.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ashobora kubikora.
I want to be there	Ndashaka ko ahari
This is very similar.	Ibi birasa cyane.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
But this is home.	Ariko iyi ni murugo.
It's not time.	Ntabwo ari igihe.
I'm not going to say anything.	Ntacyo ngiye kuvuga.
We need to know what happened.	Tugomba kumenya uko byagenze.
I love what he does	Nkunda ibyo akora
I just didn't know that	Gusa sinari nzi ko aribyo
Best friend	Inshuti nziza cyane.
You probably have to go now.	Birashoboka rwose ko ugomba kugenda ubu.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
I think that worked out well for that.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza kuri ibyo.
I can go now.	Nshobora kugenda ubu.
Very nice baby	Umwana mwiza cyane.
But he seemed to feel that he had done it.	Ariko yasaga nkaho yumva ko yabikoze.
I mean do good things.	Ndashaka kuvuga gukora ibintu byiza.
I have to try this now!	Ngomba kugerageza ibi nonaha!
The whole family.	Umuryango wose.
I know it's not good.	Nzi ko atari byiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I want to be human again	Ndashaka kongera kuba umuntu
I think so.	Ntekereza ko.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I want to talk to you alone	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe wenyine
He never liked it.	Ntabwo yigeze akunda.
In the house	Mu nzu.
None of this I did.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo nakoze.
That's not what he expected.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yiteze kubona.
I was not sure what to do	Sinari nzi neza icyo yari gukora
I didn't see it at the time.	Icyo gihe sinigeze mbona.
I mean, you can stay	Ndashaka kuvuga, urashobora kuguma
Very close but very far.	Hafi cyane ariko kure cyane.
They didn't know why they were here.	Ntabwo bari bazi impamvu bari hano.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu biragaragara.
But, it happened.	Ariko, byagenze.
You know what it is.	Uzi icyo aricyo.
I wanted to help everyone	Nashakaga gufasha abantu bose
That is the problem.	Ibyo ni ibibazo.
It was good	Byari byiza
I guess he shouldn't	Ndakeka ko atagomba
I wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe
I hope so.	Ndizera ko ari.
I guess that was a mistake	Ndakeka ko ibyo byari amakosa
I know what he is saying.	Nzi ibyo avuga.
I really did.	Nakoze rwose.
I think you can do it	Ntekereza ko ushobora kubikora
I thought to myself.	Natekerezaga wenyine.
Now is the time to work.	Ubu ni igihe cyo gukora.
It’s not just something.	Ntabwo ari ikintu gusa.
In fact, most are not.	Mubyukuri, benshi sibyo.
I can't stay away from you	Sinshobora kuguma kure yawe
But I can't do things here.	Ariko ntashobora gukora ibintu hano.
I don't have to say	Ntabwo ngomba kuvuga
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
He had enough problems.	Yari afite ibibazo bihagije.
You can see that.	Urashobora kubona ibyo.
He must be doing something good.	Agomba kuba akora ikintu cyiza.
I have a friend of yours	Mfite inshuti yawe
And that's not the whole point.	Ntabwo kandi aricyo kibazo cyose.
And you can't either.	Kandi nawe ntushobora.
Maybe he didn't do it soon enough.	Birashoboka ko atabikoze vuba bihagije.
You can have that.	Urashobora kugira iyo.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I have to talk to you alone	Ngomba kuvugana nawe wenyine
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
This is him.	Uyu niwe.
I love my son	Nkunda umuhungu wanjye
I need a lot of time.	Nkeneye igihe kinini.
I was scared	Nagize ubwoba
I wanted to leave that morning	Nashakaga kureka icyo gitondo
Take the day.	Gufata umunsi.
A lot to say.	Byinshi byo kuvuga.
They know we're here.	Bazi ko turi hano.
He said it was possible.	Yavuze ko bishoboka.
You can talk to me.	Urashobora kuvugana nanjye.
That's good.	Nibyo byiza.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
I work outside.	Nkora hanze.
I can see nothing for him	Ntacyo nshobora kubona kuri we
You can't think of anything.	Ntushobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe.
I have found faith.	Nabonye kwizera.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
He just told me.	Yambwiye gusa.
I knew it was a bad idea to come here alone	Nari nzi ko ari igitekerezo kibi kuza hano wenyine
But I can't do that.	Ariko sinshobora kubikora.
And he has.	Kandi afite.
And you can tell.	Kandi urashobora kuvuga.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
I was all this	Nari ibi byose
I like.	Nkunda.
I want to stay that way for a long time	Ndashaka kuguma gutya igihe kirekire
I needed to be close	Nari nkeneye kuba hafi
I needed money.	Nari nkeneye amafaranga.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
I love how you look	Nkunda uko usa
I don't see a problem with that.	Ntabwo mbona ikibazo kuri ibyo.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
He did something.	Yagize icyo akora.
I am very sorry for the inconvenience	Mbabajwe cyane n'iki kibazo
I think he is right.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri.
Little did I know that you could have something to love	Sinari nzi ko ushobora kugira ibyo ukunda
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
What did he do.	Yakoze iki.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
But he went to apply for a job.	Ariko yagiye gusaba akazi.
Very good book.	Igitabo cyiza cyane.
Good dog, he said good dog.	Imbwa nziza, yavuze ko imbwa nziza.
I don’t like it here or here	Ntabwo nkunda hano cyangwa hano
I didn't see anything wrong	Ntabwo nabonye ikintu kibi
He was well prepared.	Yari yiteguye neza.
Little boy	Umuhungu muto.
He is probably the only one.	Birashoboka ko ari we wenyine.
I'm glad he's gone.	Nishimiye ko yagiye.
He is here.	Ari hano.
Wouldn't it be great ?.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza?.
I thought.	Natekereje.
I didn't see the problem	Ntabwo nabonye ikibazo
I think it's really good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza rwose.
I really like the guy.	Mubyukuri nkunda umusore.
He loves to play.	Akunda gukina.
I ask him a question	Ndabaza ikibazo kuri we
And there is.	Kandi hariho.
That was before.	Ibyo byari mbere.
And on top of that, that’s exactly it.	Kandi hejuru, nibyo rwose.
I didn't mean to offend	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga nabi
It's time to dump her and move on.	Igihe cyo gukora ibyo ukora byiza.
He had to.	Yagombaga.
I knew it was for me	Nari nzi ko ari njye kuri njye
But not now, not now.	Ariko si ubu, si ubu.
You are just scared.	Ufite ubwoba gusa.
I've never seen a guy before	Sinigeze mbona umusore mbere
I am very happy with what happened	Nishimiye cyane uko byagenze
I want to go home.	Ndashaka gutaha.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
He thought it was great.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza cyane.
I should try as he did	Nkwiye kugerageza nkuko yabikoze
I didn’t want to be right.	Sinifuzaga kugira ukuri.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ni umuntu wo kureba.
I know where you are	Nzi aho uri
For me it was just an idea.	Kuri njye byari igitekerezo gusa.
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza.
He knew he could do it.	Yari azi ko ashobora kubikora.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
I thought quickly.	Natekereje vuba.
The problem is close.	Ikibazo ni hafi.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
A lot of time to think.	Igihe kinini cyo gutekereza.
There is also for us.	Hariho na twe.
But I don’t know how to do it.	Ariko sinzi kubikora.
This is not the case.	Ibi sibyo.
As a gift.	Nka impano.
I am the only one	Ninjye wenyine
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And he was young.	Kandi yari muto.
But you can have something.	Ariko urashobora kugira ikintu.
I don't get the idea.	Ntabwo mbona igitekerezo.
That worked out very well.	Ibyo byagenze neza rwose.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko yabikoze.
We can't wait to learn more !.	Ntidushobora gutegereza kwiga byinshi!.
In and out.	Muri no hanze.
I can't do that right now	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora nonaha
He had many friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
I really like the way	Nkunda cyane uburyo
I didn't know why.	Sinari nzi impamvu.
He will be home tomorrow.	Ejo azaba murugo.
I need time to think	Nkeneye igihe cyo gutekereza
I want to do better	Ndashaka gukora neza
I can't see anything wrong	Sinshobora kubona ikintu kibi
We need to know where we are.	Tugomba kumenya aho turi.
He never had a drink problem.	Ntiyigeze agira ikibazo cyo kunywa.
I think we should do it as soon as possible	Ntekereza ko tugomba kubikora vuba bishoboka
As much as possible.	Nkuko bishoboka.
I think he may have been right	Ntekereza ko ashobora kuba yari afite ukuri
He did it every night.	Yabikoze buri joro.
I think this is good.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza.
I don't have to be here	Ntabwo ngomba kuba hano
I saw a lot	Nabonye byinshi
We have to think that is possible.	Tugomba gutekereza ko ibyo bishoboka.
He did a lot, easy to read.	Yakoze byinshi, byoroshye gusoma.
That's really possible.	Ibyo rwose birashoboka.
I had no idea what to do	Ntabwo nari mfite igitekerezo na gito cyo gukora
He needed to know.	Yari akeneye kumenya.
I want to do something	Ndashaka kugira icyo nkora
And, we were out there, and it was great.	Kandi, twari hanze, nibyiza.
I never thought about quitting.	Sinigeze ntekereza kureka.
I think everyone is scared	Ntekereza ko uwo ari we wese afite ubwoba
Not good enough.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
I got what you want	Nabonye icyo ushaka
I'm bad.	Ndi mubi.
Things were really good.	Ibintu byari byiza rwose.
The dog didn't come.	Imbwa ntabwo yaje.
I think you have to buy something	Ntekereza ko ugomba kugura ikintu
It looks exactly right.	Asa neza neza.
I saw no one, I heard nothing	Nta muntu nabonye, ​​nta kintu numvise
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
I heard instead of seeing	Numvise aho kubona
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
I saw nothing	Nta na kimwe nabonye
You, me, everyone.	Wowe, njye, abantu bose.
I can't drive anything else	Sinshobora gutwara ikindi
You are one woman.	Uri umugore umwe.
Can anyone please tell me?	Hari ushobora kumenya nyamuneka?.
He is in everything.	Ari muri byose.
That's right.	Nibyo nibyo.
I didn't know you were going here	Sinari nzi ko ugiye hano
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
I can do a lot	Nshobora gukora byinshi
I have a lot to learn to do	Mfite byinshi byo kwiga gukora
We are a gift.	Ni impano.
He was young and beautiful.	Yari muto kandi yari mwiza.
He tried to speak.	Yagerageje kuvuga.
I think you're something else	Ntekereza ko uri ikindi kintu
But if it worked out well.	Ariko niba byagenze neza.
The child has to play every day.	Umwana agomba gukina buri munsi.
I wanted to know more	Nashakaga kumenya neza
I wanted this, whatever it was	Nashakaga ibi, ibyo aribyo byose
It is not without reason.	Ntabwo ari nta mpamvu.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
I saw it early this morning	Nabonye kare kare muri iki gitondo
I'm sorry	Mbabajwe.
He seemed to be doing nothing.	Yasaga naho ntacyo akora.
I don't know what happened.	Ntabwo nzi uko byagenze.
No one seems to be home right now.	Kuri ubu nta muntu usa nkaho ari murugo.
He became a human being.	Yatangiye kuba umuntu.
Years before Mary.	Imyaka ya Mariya mbere.
It's every day.	Ni buri munsi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane mubyukuri.
No big deal, after all.	Nta kibazo kinini, nyuma ya byose.
There is more to him than this.	Hariho byinshi kuri we kurenza ibi.
I'm glad this happened.	Nishimiye ibi.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I didn't need to talk.	Sinari nkeneye kuvuga.
But here it was.	Ariko hano byari.
Little did I know that he was very young.	Sinari nzi ko yari muto cyane.
I think you should go with it.	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kujyana.
I can't go home.	Ntashobora gutaha.
Car, very likely.	Imodoka, birashoboka cyane.
I think he did.	Ntekereza ko yabikoze.
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
I don't want to live like that.	Sinshaka kubaho gutya.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
I mean, everything	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibintu byose
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Kuba ahari igihe yari akeneye umuntu.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
I found it great	Nabonye ari byiza
I don't think so	Ntekereza ko nta kintu na kimwe ntekereza
I was out.	Nari hanze.
He was an outsider.	Yari umuntu wo hanze.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
Well, well, well.	Nibyiza, nibyiza.
No one knew exactly what to expect.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi neza icyo ugomba gutegereza.
I had short hair	Nari mfite umusatsi muto
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
I never thought it was me.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ari njye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
Everyone is a movie.	Umuntu wese ni firime.
I thought so and so hard to come here at all	Natekereje cyane kandi bigoye kuza hano rwose
A lot of people were scared	Abantu benshi bari bafite ubwoba
I saw no problem	Nta kibazo nabonye
And, of course, it was a good idea.	Kandi, rwose byari igitekerezo cyiza.
He was not really.	Ntabwo yari mubyukuri.
I need to know who he is	Ngomba kumenya neza uwo ari we
He has to tell everything.	Agomba kubwira byose.
I have to go back to school	Ngomba gusubira ku ishuri
I can't say tomorrow	Sinshobora kuvuga ejo
The back was very low.	Inyuma yari hasi cyane.
I can't come to eat.	Sinshobora kuza kurya.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
I have a loving family	Mfite umuryango ukunda
I am happy for the opportunity	Nishimiye amahirwe
I really needed it	Nari nkeneye cyane
He looked down.	Yarebye hasi.
I knew I was.	Nari nzi ko ndimo.
He had a plan	Yari afite gahunda
I just want the best food	Ndashaka ibiryo byiza gusa
I need to wait until tomorrow	Nkeneye gutegereza kugeza ejo
I really had.	Nari mfite rwose.
And so far, he was right about everything.	Kandi kugeza ubu, yari afite ukuri kuri byose.
I am everything	Ndi byose
He just said he did.	Gusa yavuze ko yabikoze.
He did not come.	Ntabwo yaje.
It worked really well.	Byagenze neza rwose.
I hear this	Ndumva iki kintu
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
I wanted to	Nashakaga
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu.
I didn't know what to think or feel	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza cyangwa kumva
I got to work before.	Nabonye gukora mbere.
And maybe not for long.	Kandi birashoboka ko atari igihe kirekire.
I know a lot of people upstairs	Nzi abantu benshi hejuru
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari birashoboka cyane, mubyukuri.
I was a little girl.	Nari umukobwa muto.
I needed to do this	Nari nkeneye gukora ibi
I appreciate your time	Nishimiye umwanya wawe
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
You and I.	Wowe na njye.
What you saw is what you saw.	Ibyo wabonye nibyo wabonye.
I know enough not to do it.	Nzi bihagije kutabikora.
Like all of us.	Kimwe natwe twese.
I knew it was for me	Nari nzi ko ari njye kuri njye
I must have heard something.	Ngomba kuba numva ikintu.
I'm sure it's the same for him.	Nzi neza ko ari kimwe kuri we.
A very long time	Igihe kinini cyane
You may be right.	Urashobora kuba ufite ukuri.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
I had never seen anyone	Nta muntu nari nabonye
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I didn't know what you meant.	Sinari nzi ko ushaka kuvuga.
It would be difficult.	Byaba bigoye.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I needed to get out of this	Nari nkeneye kuva muri ibi
I can't live like that	Sinshobora kubaho gutya
We needed a plan.	Twari dukeneye gahunda.
Here is a book.	Hano hari igitabo.
That's good.	Nibyo byiza.
He said something.	Hari icyo yavuze.
The guy could do a lot	Umusore yashoboraga gukora byinshi
He wants to.	Ni we ashaka.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
Knowing he shouldn't.	Kumenya ko atagomba.
In fact, that's exactly what happened.	Mubyukuri, nibyo rwose.
He knew something.	Yari azi ikintu.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
We have to wait and see.	Tugomba kongera gutegereza.
A house is just a house	Inzu ni inzu gusa
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta kibazo kinini.
Only.	Gusa.
You can't look away.	Ntushobora kureba kure.
And you are far away.	Kandi uri kure.
That is not one of them.	Ibyo ntabwo ari kimwe muri byo.
But you can't come that day.	Ariko uwo munsi ntushobora kuza.
I have a family near me	Mfite umuryango hafi yanjye
I thought this was a good idea	Natekereje ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza
I was very outside	Nari hanze cyane
You can find a house.	Urashobora kubona inzu.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
You are	Uri se.
He will be there too.	Na we azaba ahari.
I think that's a good idea	Ntekereza ko icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza
I like to be in you	Nkunda kuba muri wowe
I get the same problem when I do that	Mbona ikibazo kimwe mugihe nkora ibyo
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I have a little time	Mfite igihe gito
I hope that worked out well	Ndizera ko ibyo byari gukora neza
I am happy for your family.	Nishimiye umuryango wawe.
This is a very bad idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo kibi cyane.
I want to have a family	Ndashaka kugira umuryango
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
He has money.	Afite amafaranga.
I know he is right	Nzi ko avuga ukuri
That is the book.	Icyo ni igitabo.
You can be.	Urashobora kuba.
I didn't have time	Ntabwo nari mfite umwanya
He did a lot, he did a lot.	Yakoze byinshi, akora byinshi.
Mine I don’t think why.	Wanjye ntabwo ntekereza impamvu.
And there are times.	Kandi hari igihe.
I thought we needed time	Natekereje ko dukeneye umwanya
I really think it was great.	Ndatekereza rwose ko byari byiza.
This is a big room.	Iki cyumba kinini.
Or tomorrow morning.	Cyangwa ejo mu gitondo.
They are scared.	Bafite ubwoba.
And you can see his point.	Kandi urashobora kubona igitekerezo cye.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko ari byiza.
People are scared.	Abantu bafite ubwoba.
It would be nice if you could talk to him.	Niba ushobora kuvugana nawe byaba byiza.
You can definitely do that.	Urashobora rwose kubikora.
Nice to meet you	Nishimiye kubana nawe
He could be a guy.	Ashobora kuba umusore.
Many children.	Abana benshi.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
Not when he was very close.	Ntabwo ari igihe yari hafi cyane.
I just wasn’t sure if it was a good idea	Gusa sinari nzi neza ko ari igitekerezo cyiza
I really believe in it	Ndizera cyane mubyukuri
I can't increase your money	Ntabwo nshobora kongera amafaranga yawe
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
His family is here.	Umuryango we uri hano.
I want to hear everything	Ndashaka kumva byose
I was not close	Ntabwo nari hafi
Walking this morning.	Kugenda muri iki gitondo.
I just knew what he said to me, that's right	Nari nzi gusa ibyo yambwiye, nibyo
I like to read.	Nkunda gusoma.
It would be much easier to just give up.	Byaba byoroshye cyane kureka gusa.
It's too young.	Ndi muto.
He could not have come at a better time.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kuza mugihe cyiza.
And he.	Na we.
I had a really good family	Nari mfite umuryango mwiza rwose
I don't really like it	Ntabwo nkunda rwose
Yes, he did.	Nibyo, yabikoze neza.
I thought later.	Natekereje nyuma.
I was lucky enough to get a chance	Nagize amahirwe yo kubona amahirwe
I don't think that's the big deal.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aricyo kibazo kinini.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
We are here to help !.	Turi hano gufasha!.
At the time, I didn't think much of it	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga neza
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
And he didn't want to go.	Kandi ntiyashakaga kugenda.
But, well, here.	Ariko, neza, hano.
But that was normal.	Ariko ibyo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
When he was happy to live	Igihe yari yishimiye kubaho
He feels alone.	Yumva wenyine.
A child is a child.	Umwana ni umwana.
I have a lot of problems	Mfite ibibazo byinshi
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I had nothing good to do.	Nta kintu cyiza nari mfite cyo gukora.
Why.	Impamvu.
Maybe things would work out now.	Ahari ibintu byari kugenda neza nonaha.
I have something.	Mfite ikintu.
This is obvious.	Ibi biragaragara.
He seemed young.	Yasaga naho ari muto.
But you are not the same person.	Ariko ntabwo uri umuntu umwe.
She looked so beautiful.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza cyane.
I have to do something	Ngomba kugira icyo nkora
Food was close by.	Ibiryo byari hafi.
I am looking for my son at home	Ndashaka umuhungu wanjye murugo
I want to know how well he does.	Ndashaka kumenya uko akora neza.
He worked on one.	Yakoze kuri kimwe.
Maybe a lot.	Ahari byinshi.
You really have a favorite kid.	Ufite rwose umwana ukunda.
And no one.	Kandi nta n'umwe.
I think you can do a lot of good things	Ntekereza ko ushobora gukora ibintu byinshi byiza
I like the simple way	Nkunda uburyo byoroshye
I needed to talk to you	Nari nkeneye kuvugana nawe
I know where he will be.	Nzi aho azaba.
I got really bad	Nabonye nabi rwose
You don’t have to buy.	Ntagomba kugura.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
I had it here	Nari mfite hano
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo cyiza.
I don't like it now.	Ntabwo nkunda ubu.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I guess he is not at home	Ndakeka ko atari murugo
That was up to him.	Ibyo byari kuri we.
How to do it.	Uburyo bwo kubikora.
At the moment he just asked.	Kuri ubu yabajije gusa.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
And who he is.	Kandi uwo ari we.
He asked all the questions.	Yabajije ibibazo byose.
To drink	Kunywa.
He had a job.	Yari afite akazi.
But this is my baby.	Ariko uyu ni umwana wanjye.
He didn't know much.	Ntabwo yari azi byinshi.
Really bad time.	Igihe kibi rwose.
I think we may have a problem, a big problem	Ntekereza ko dushobora kugira ikibazo, ikibazo kinini
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I think that's good	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza
And you are.	Kandi uri.
I believe that problems are opportunities	Nizera ko ibibazo ari amahirwe
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
Your house could do a lot.	Inzu yawe yashoboraga gukora byinshi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu.
It was easy to walk.	Byari byoroshye kugenda.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
I have to do something about that	Ngomba kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo
I know everyone here	Nzi abantu bose hano
I don't think it's a bad thing	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari ikintu kibi
I had everything	Nari mfite ibintu byose
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
I know that's the case	Nzi ko kubyo aribyo
I knew nothing	Ntacyo nari nzi
I thought of going back to the phone	Natekereje gusubira kuri terefone
I think it's good	Ntekereza ko ari mwiza
I knew a lot of people	Nari nzi abantu benshi
The worst thing to see.	Ikintu kibi cyane cyo kubona.
That's not really the case.	Ntabwo aribyo mubyukuri.
I was a favorite	Nari umuntu ukunda
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza cyane.
More opportunities ahead.	Amahirwe menshi imbere.
I love a guy.	Nkunda umusore.
I'm scared to go	Mfite ubwoba bwo kugenda
All of this is true.	Ibyo byose ni ukuri.
I really felt it today	Numvise rwose muri iki gihe
He may have a problem.	Ashobora kugira ikibazo.
I'm not sure if that is possible	Sinzi neza niba ibyo bishoboka
I was scared of him	Nagize ubwoba kuri we
And you can talk about it a lot.	Kandi ushobora no kuvuga kuri byinshi.
I knew one of us could go	Nari nzi ko umwe muri twe yashoboraga kugenda
You work hard, and you do well.	Ukora cyane, kandi ukora neza.
It was not difficult.	Ntabwo byari bigoye.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
I can do it at home	Nshobora kubikora murugo
This is like a new movie	Iyi ni nka firime nshya
Lots.	Byinshi.
I shouldn't do that	Ntabwo nkwiye kubikora
I guess that's possible	Ndakeka ko bishoboka
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
He is here.	Ari hano.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu.
I do everything	Nkora byose
I knew his father.	Nari nzi se.
I needed to work fast	Nari nkeneye gukora vuba
You don't have to come.	Ntugomba kuza.
This is him.	Uyu niwe.
I saw a lot of things	Nabonye ibintu byinshi
He said something.	Hari icyo yavuze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I want whatever you want	Ndashaka icyo ushaka cyose
I never worked on it.	Ntabwo nigeze nkora kuri yo.
He looked bad.	Yasaga nabi.
No problem so far.	Nta kibazo kugeza ubu.
I didn’t want to go forward	Sinifuzaga kujya imbere
If anyone has any ideas.	Niba hari umuntu ufite igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose.
I never understood why he wanted to be friends now	Sinigeze numva impamvu yashakaga kuba inshuti nonaha
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo.
It is now.	Ubu ni.
I wanted to see more	Nashakaga kubona byinshi
I just need food, that's all	Nkeneye gusa ibyo kurya, nibyo byose
I didn't know why at the time.	Sinari nzi impamvu icyo gihe.
I want to go with you	Ndashaka kujyana nawe
I should look ahead.	Nkwiye kureba imbere.
I hope you are here	Nizera ko uri hano
He was not alone.	Ntiyari wenyine.
I can't hear him go	Sinshobora kumva agenda
We can't believe we have to do it.	Ntidushobora kwizera dufite kubikora.
I was looking for something	Nashakaga ikintu
I have to take my car	Ngomba gufata imodoka yanjye
I don't know, but it's possible.	Sinzi, ariko birashoboka.
The money would come.	Amafaranga yari kuza.
All of this is not here or here.	Ibi byose ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
I know who he is.	Nzi uwo ari we.
You have to play.	Ugomba gukina.
I think he's playing with us	Ntekereza ko arimo gukina natwe
They don't know where he is.	Ntabwo bazi aho ari.
I really didn’t have one	Ntabwo rwose nari mfite
I didn’t know what he did, what he did	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo yakoze, icyo yakoze
You are very good.	Ufite neza cyane.
I need money, and more	Nkeneye amafaranga, kandi menshi
There are many of them.	Hariho byinshi muri byo.
I knew what you meant	Nari nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga
I know what you think.	Nzi icyo utekereza.
You have to tell me what happened.	Ugomba kumbwira uko byagenze.
Little did I know that he would do it	Sinari nzi ko azabikora
I don’t mean to say he was young.	Sinshaka kuvuga ko akiri muto.
I saw it as a good time	Nabonye ari igihe cyiza
But it worked.	Ariko byagenze neza.
I didn’t want my time	Ntabwo nashakaga umwanya wanjye
He was there.	Yari ahari.
I'm close now	Ubu ndi hafi
I was close.	Nari hafi.
I want to help people.	Ndashaka gufasha abantu.
I just wanted to be in the movie	Nashakaga gusa kuba muri firime
I got clothes.	Nabonye imyenda.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko byari byinshi cyane.
I know exactly where we are	Nzi neza aho turi
But that’s just the thing.	Ariko icyo ni ikintu gusa.
I can't believe he's gone	Sinshobora kwizera ko yagiye
Obviously not recently.	Biragaragara ko atari vuba aha.
I was three years old.	Nari mfite imyaka itatu.
That's a good thing.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza.
I think about everything	Ntekereza kuri byose
I really think he knows what he's up to.	Ndatekereza rwose ko azi ibyo arimo.
I didn’t know he had one of those	Sinari nzi ko afite kimwe muri ibyo
I have a gift for the young.	Mfite impano kuri muto.
I didn't know you were there today	Sinari nzi ko urimo uyu munsi
One thing is for sure, however.	Ikintu kimwe nukuri, ariko.
I never liked it here	Ntabwo nigeze nkunda hano
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
He was a family.	Yari umuryango.
I never thought it was good for me.	Sinigeze mbona ko ari mwiza kuri njye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He came.	Yaje.
I really want to know the truth.	Ndashaka rwose kumenya ukuri.
The interior is beautiful.	Imbere ni nziza.
I was not sure what it was	Sinari nzi neza icyo aricyo
I should have been better	Nari nkwiye kugira neza
He had the same.	Yari afite kimwe.
He really wanted to.	Yashakaga rwose.
Down with him.	Hasi hamwe na we.
I know it's not easy.	Nzi ko atari ibintu byoroshye.
I need to look down	Nkeneye kureba hasi
There is no one in my house.	Mu nzu yanjye nta muntu n'umwe.
We would just eat.	Twari kurya gusa.
I knew in that look that they had succeeded	Nari nzi ko nta cyiza bari bafite
I ask everything now	Ndabaza buri kintu ubu
I really hope it was a good read	Nizere rwose ko byari byiza gusoma
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But it is not completely outside.	Ariko ntabwo ari hanze rwose.
In the plan was money.	Muri gahunda yari amafaranga.
I knew he loved gifts, but not so much	Nari nzi ko akunda impano, ariko sibyo cyane
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
If that was the case.	Niba ibyo byari ikintu.
I didn't know you were scared	Sinari nzi ko ufite ubwoba
And you did.	Kandi wabikoze.
It was not his fault at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo byari amakosa ye.
I have made many friends	Nabonye inshuti nyinshi
This is his time.	Uyu ni umwanya we.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
He was there today.	Uyu munsi yari ahari.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I have a little question about that	Mfite ikibazo gito kuri ibyo
You are really scared.	Nukuri ufite ubwoba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Mostly, just today	Byinshi, uyumunsi gusa
He picked up the phone.	Yafashe terefone.
I'm going to try to do it at home	Ngiye kugerageza kubikora murugo
I was very far away.	Nari kure cyane.
I'm glad it's not just me.	nishimiye ko atari njye gusa.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I needed a home	Nari nkeneye murugo
I don't know where we are	Ntabwo nzi aho turi
I was really scared for a while.	Nagize ubwoba rwose mugihe gito.
It was not true! 	Ntabwo byari ukuri!
I need to go now	Nkeneye kugenda ubu
I know you are.	Nzi ko uri.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
In any case, he has nothing to 'do'.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta kintu na kimwe agomba 'gukora'.
I thought my family was bad	Natekerezaga ko umuryango wanjye wari mubi
I just need time	Nkeneye igihe gusa
I don’t believe any of that.	Ntabwo nizera kimwe muri byo.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto
He also loved it.	Yakundaga kandi.
I just believe in myself, now	Ndizera gusa muri njye, ubu
And it was a great experience.	Kandi byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I might try another time	Nshobora kugerageza ikindi gihe
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo, birashoboka ko atari byo.
You can't go wrong.	Ntushobora kugenda neza.
And he would be right.	Kandi yaba afite ukuri.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu ntabwo yari afite igitekerezo.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He did not know what to expect.	Ntiyari azi icyo yari yiteze.
I can't go to dinner	Sinshobora kujya kurya
I can't do it alone	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora wenyine
I just don't know who.	Gusa sinzi uwo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
There is no "good time" for me.	Nta 'gihe cyiza' kuri njye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Someone is looking for you.	Hariho wowe ushaka ikintu.
To the top.	Kuri hejuru.
I never understood why	Sinigeze numva neza impamvu
I can't understand why	Sinshobora kumva impamvu
But that is not good.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
I can't do it here	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora hano
But not now.	Ariko si ubu.
I'm doing it.	Ndimo kubikora.
Everyone wants to be your friend.	Umuntu wese arashaka kuba inshuti yawe.
I can't wait to talk to you	Sinshobora gutegereza kuvugana nawe
I knew he was close.	Nari nzi ko ari hafi.
I was here to hear	Nari hano kumva
I saw no one	Nta muntu n'umwe nabonye
I also knew that this was not good	Nari nzi kandi ko ibyo atari byiza
I am looking for a place of my own	Ndashaka umwanya wenyine wenyine
You have to be here.	Ugomba kuba hano.
He said he did not want to.	Yavuze ko adashaka.
A little closer.	Hafi ya gato.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
I can't say much about it	Sinshobora kuvuga byinshi kuri byo
He didn't mean anything.	Ntacyo yashakaga kuvuga.
You can do it right.	Urashobora kubikora neza.
I don't know anyone	Ntabwo nzi umuntu
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
There is nothing we can do about it tonight.	Ntacyo dushobora gukora muri iri joro.
Something my wife wants.	Ikintu umugore wanjye ashaka.
I wanted to say something, everything	Nashakaga kuvuga ikintu, ikintu cyose
I think it will be a great experience	Ndatekereza ko bizaba ari ibintu byiza cyane
Very close.	Hafi cyane.
It was probably his gift.	Birashoboka ko yari impano ye.
He needed that.	Yari akeneye ibyo.
She was beautiful, she was beautiful.	Yari mwiza, yari mwiza cyane.
I really enjoyed staying in the house	Nishimiye cyane kuguma mu nzu
He was a wise man.	Yari umuntu uzi ubwenge.
He doesn't want to talk to me again.	Ntabwo yifuza kongera kuvugana nanjye.
He loved money.	Yakundaga amafaranga.
I have to talk to you	Ngomba kuvugana nawe
You really can.	Mubyukuri urashobora.
But things went wrong.	Ariko ibintu byagenze nabi.
There is something for everyone.	Hariho ikintu kuri buri wese.
'	'
He would not say.	Ntabwo yari kuvuga.
No need to give up.	Nta mpamvu yo kureka.
We need something else.	Dukeneye ikindi kintu.
The truth about where he went, what he did when he was there.	Ukuri aho yagiye, ibyo yakoze igihe yari ahari.
Every day, the same thing.	Buri munsi, ikintu kimwe.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
You have to.	Ugomba.
He said anything.	Yavuze ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
Maybe we should talk to you again. 	Birashoboka ko tugomba kongera kuvugana nawe.
'	'
Down on him.	Hasi kuri we.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
He had to try.	Yagombaga kugerageza.
Lots of great tips here.	Inama nyinshi nziza hano.
I think you just have to talk to him	Ntekereza ko ugomba kuvugana nawe gusa
He is confident that.	Yizeye neza ko.
I think that's good	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza
I believe.	Ndizera.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
I hope it’s not too much	Ndizera ko atari byinshi
You really have to.	Ugomba rwose.
She was really looking forward to seeing her son.	Yari yiteze rwose kubona umuhungu we.
I'm sure you can think of it.	Nzi neza ko ushobora gutekereza.
I really think he meant what he said	Ndatekereza rwose ko yashakaga kuvuga ibyo yavuze
I hope he never did.	Nizera ko atigeze agira.
If we.	Niba twe.
He was only there for me.	Yari ahari kuri njye gusa.
He was not inside.	Ntiyari imbere.
I never liked this issue	Sinigeze nkunda iki kibazo
His father was not sitting.	Ntabwo se yari yicaye.
I know what he can do	Nzi icyo ashobora gukora
I have to stop hearing this from him	Ngomba kureka kumva ibi kuri we
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
I never saw it as a problem.	Sinigeze mbona ko ari ikibazo.
I need to think clearly	Nkeneye gutekereza neza
We are just human beings.	Turi abantu gusa.
I feel good.	Ndumva ari mwiza.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
I don’t have to try too hard for the truth	Ntabwo ngomba kugerageza cyane ukuri
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
I knew what he was doing	Nari nzi icyo arimo gukora
And this is great.	Kandi ibi ni byiza cyane.
Not to this day.	Ntabwo kugeza uyu munsi.
He thought I needed a friend	Yatekereje ko nkeneye inshuti
But he must know for sure.	Ariko agomba kumenya neza.
I'm glad to be back	Nishimiye gusubira ku kazi
I think they had simple problems.	Ntekereza ko bari bafite ibibazo byoroshye.
Anything else.	Ikindi kintu cyose.
Apparently you did.	Biragaragara ko wabikoze.
They know where you are.	Bazi aho uri.
I hope everything went well	Nizere ko byose byagenze neza
I didn't know he was a friend	Sinari nzi ko ari inshuti
You don’t have to walk alone.	Ntugomba kugenda wenyine.
We have what we need most.	Dufite ibyo dukeneye cyane.
I just saw everything	Gusa nabonye ari byose
I haven't heard anything since	Kuva icyo gihe nta kintu numvise
I didn’t do much this morning	Ntacyo nakoze cyane muri iki gitondo
There is something else, however.	Hariho ikindi kintu, ariko.
If not good.	Niba atari byiza.
He started inside.	Yatangiye imbere.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza amafaranga kugeza ubu.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
I did nothing wrong, here	Nta kibi nakoze, hano
I am so happy to have friends like her	Nishimiye cyane kugira inshuti nka we
And that was true.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri.
And here it was.	Kandi hano byari.
No one ever did.	Nta muntu wigeze akora.
I had a bus	Nari mfite bisi
Age if you need a long time.	Imyaka niba ukeneye igihe kirekire.
He wanted to do something.	Yashakaga kugira icyo akora.
I mean, you're good to me	Ndashaka kuvuga, uri mwiza kuri njye
You do what you have to do with me.	Ukora ibyo ufite nanjye.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
It's good to be here.	Nibyiza kuba hano.
He can try.	Arashobora kugerageza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza.
I didn’t want to be at school	Sinifuzaga kuba ku ishuri
I think we should stay here	Ndatekereza ko tugomba kuguma hano
I haven't seen it since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona
I thought for a moment.	Natekereje gato.
I don't know, man.	Sinzi, muntu.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
From above.	Kuva hejuru.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo.
I always thought that was the case	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko aribyo
I know what he thinks.	Nzi icyo atekereza.
I know exactly what happened	Nzi neza uko byagenze
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Something he wanted to say.	Ikintu yashakaga kuvuga.
He was lucky.	Yari afite amahirwe.
Obviously it's a big deal for everyone.	Biragaragara ko ari ikintu kinini cyane kuri bose.
I have to find someone	Ngomba kubona umuntu
He said.	Yavuze.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I don't think so	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
He told me what he needed.	Yambwiye icyo yari akeneye.
He will be there.	Azaba ahari.
I know how hard you work	Nzi uburyo ukora cyane
I heard what he said before	Numvise ibyo yavuze mbere
He would know what to do.	Yari kumenya icyo gukora.
Or as good as he will be.	Cyangwa nibyiza nkuko azabikora.
I knew what he could do	Nari nzi icyo yashoboraga gukora
I guess you were at the time	Ndakeka ko wari urimo icyo gihe
I am a very bad person.	Ndi umuntu mubi cyane.
I have to talk to you	Ngomba kuvugana nawe
So do we.	Natwe natwe.
I didn't know you were close	Sinari nzi ko uri hafi
i don't know what to do	ntabwo nzi icyo gukora
For all? 	Kuri bose?
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I mean, it’s.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ni.
I needed to do simple things to look at.	Nari nkeneye gukora ibintu byoroshye byo kureba.
Since that day, I have not heard anything	Kuva uwo munsi, nta kintu na kimwe numvise
I hope so.	Nizera ko atari byo.
In all things.	Muri byose.
Se.	Se.
He said he could not do it.	Yavuze ko adashobora kubikora.
I have to learn a lot	Ngomba kwiga byinshi
Things are great.	Ibintu ni byiza cyane.
He has a job.	Afite akazi.
I had the opportunity to take a quick look	Nagize amahirwe yo kureba vuba
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
I didn't have a job	Ntabwo nari mfite akazi
That's not what you think.	Ntabwo aribyo utekereza.
The girl would not speak.	Umukobwa ntiyari kuvuga.
I don’t want to say something about stopping work.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga ikintu cyo guhagarika akazi.
I just didn't know why	Gusa sinari nzi impamvu
I have not always had the opportunity	Ntabwo buri gihe nagize amahirwe
This is not him.	Uyu si we.
I was not at the meeting.	Ntabwo nari muri iyo nama.
I have another problem	Mfite ikindi kibazo
It is very similar to us today.	Birasa cyane natwe muri iki gihe.
Everyone is here.	Abantu bose bari hano.
I guess he knows what he's doing	Ndakeka ko azi ibyo akora
To read	Gusoma.
This is before and after the study.	Ibi ni mbere na nyuma yo kwiga.
And there is a problem.	Kandi hariho ikibazo.
I should have looked at that time.	Nari nkwiye kureba icyo gihe.
I was really bad	Nari mubi rwose
I have to go back to work.	Ngomba gusubira ku kazi.
He does nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora.
Every time he speaks, he always says so.	Igihe cyose avuga, ahora avuga gutya.
Money, money, money.	Amafaranga, amafaranga, amafaranga.
I did not know the truth	Sinari nzi ukuri
This is a person.	Uyu ni umuntu.
I never even thought about trying	Sinigeze ntekereza no kugerageza
He didn't want to hear anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga kumva.
This is us too	Ibi natwe
And that is a very good thing.	Kandi ibyo ni ibintu byiza cyane.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, byari kubikora.
You have to have faith.	Ugomba kugira kwizera.
I shouldn’t have done that	Sinari nkwiye kubikora
For me.	Kuri njye.
I wonder why he was here	Ndabaza impamvu yari hano
I need to stay here for a while	Nkeneye kuguma hano igihe gito
I want to go tomorrow	Ndashaka kugenda ejo
I can't be here	Ntabwo nshobora kuba hano
He needed to talk to someone.	Yari akeneye kuvugana n'umuntu.
I really knew that	Nari nzi ibyo mubyukuri
I was a good teacher.	Nari umwarimu mwiza.
I hope he is right	Ndizera ko avuga ukuri
I can't read this	Ntabwo nshobora gusoma ibi
But he had it in him.	Ariko yari afite muri we.
Really, really.	Nukuri, rwose.
One could be a girl.	Umuntu yashoboraga kuba umukobwa.
But we have work to do.	Ariko dufite akazi tugomba gukora.
You want to know what you are doing.	Urashaka kumenya icyo ukora.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I feel like you have to do what you have to do.	Ndumva ugomba gukora ibyo ugomba gukora.
I shouldn't be here at all, really	Ntabwo nkwiye kuba hano rwose, mubyukuri
Maybe he never said.	Birashoboka ko atigeze avuga.
I thought you were.	Natekereje ko uri.
I shouldn't have done anything	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gukora ikintu na kimwe
It's best to drink before you drink.	Nibyiza mbere yo kunywa.
Because, he is here.	Kuba, ari hano.
No problem so far.	Nta kibazo kugeza ubu.
He is one of us.	Ni umwe muri twe.
I didn't know that	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe no kubikora.
They had none.	Ntabwo bari bafite.
We have to go fast.	Tugomba kugenda vuba.
And you didn't.	Kandi ntabwo wabikoze.
It was not on schedule.	Ntabwo byari muri gahunda.
He did it very well.	Yabikoze neza cyane.
More than any woman.	Kuruta umugore uwo ari we wese.
And things were going well.	Kandi ibintu byari kugenda neza.
We were not very close.	Ntabwo twari hafi cyane.
And that.	Kandi ibyo.
And he probably was.	Kandi birashoboka ko yari.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
I really had.	Nari mfite rwose.
He thought it was wrong.	Yatekereje ko atari byo.
I'm thinking of doing a job now	Ndatekereza gukora akazi ubu
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
I mean, it's good	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari mwiza
But not like me.	Ariko ntabwo nkanjye.
I thought it would be nice	Natekereje ko byaba byiza
Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.
I also feel scared	Nanjye ndumva afite ubwoba
Not really good.	Ntabwo ari byiza rwose.
He has to go home now.	Agomba gutaha ubu.
I hope you saw it before.	Ndizera ko wabonye mbere.
'Me !.	'Njye !.
The whole book.	Igitabo cyose.
I saw something behind me	Nabonye ikintu inyuma yanjye
I had no job	Nta kazi nari mfite
Much like him.	Byinshi nka we.
As you have to give up.	Nkuko ugomba kureka.
Take a good look.	Kureba neza.
She is your daughter.	Ni umukobwa wawe.
He did it all.	Yakoze byose.
There is something else here.	Hano hari ikindi kintu.
You can't go home, not really.	Ntushobora gutaha, ntabwo mubyukuri.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga cyangwa ntacyo
She says the girl is his daughter.	Avuga ko umukobwa ari umukobwa we.
Or we can't.	Cyangwa ntidushobora.
They are scared.	Bafite ubwoba.
I don't know where	Ntabwo nzi aho
And that was hard to live with.	Kandi ibyo byari bigoye kubana.
I didn't think so but in reality	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo ariko mubyukuri
Yours is good.	Kuki yawe ni nziza.
I shouldn’t have looked	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kureba
I think he needs time	Ndakeka ko akeneye igihe
Hair is just hair.	Umusatsi ni umusatsi gusa.
It's too early.	Ni kare cyane.
She is wearing a party.	Yambaye ibirori.
I want to go upstairs	Ndashaka kujya hejuru
But he did not know for sure.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza.
I mean, it was a mistake.	Ndashaka kuvuga, byari amakosa.
I wasn't sure if it was true	Sinari nzi neza ko ari ukuri
Not much, but at home.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, ariko ni murugo.
I really need to know	Nkeneye rwose kumenya
We have time.	Dufite umwanya.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
None of us have.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ufite.
He did not come today.	Ntabwo yaje muri iki gihe.
And there is a chance to do it again.	Kandi hari amahirwe yo kongera kubikora.
I think it would be nice	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza
He wants to.	Arashaka.
Walking would be close.	Kugenda byaba hafi.
I can't take my daughter	Sinshobora gufata umukobwa wanjye
You're out with him too.	Nawe uri hanze hamwe na we.
I hope you love learning and love school	Nizere ko ukunda kwiga kandi ukunda ishuri
It was too far.	Yari kure cyane.
There are many reasons.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi.
I wanted to think	Nashakaga gutekereza
I don’t know what it is, okay.	Sinzi icyo aricyo, neza.
I was the only and very young girl in the distance	Nari umukobwa wenyine kandi muto cyane kure
But you have to know the truth.	Ariko ugomba kumenya ukuri.
I'm not sure what to say	Nzi neza icyo yari kuvuga
He says it's good to go now.	Avuga ko ari byiza kugenda ubu.
I know you have to do this alone	Nzi ko ugomba gukora ibi wenyine
That's good.	Nibyiza.
The boy is not old.	Umuhungu ntabwo afite imyaka.
You have to go back to school with us.	Ugomba gusubira mwishuri hamwe natwe.
I hope he is scared	Ndizera ko afite ubwoba
I don't want this phone.	Sinshaka iyi terefone.
I know there is a guy	Nzi ko hari umusore
It was his last chance to speak.	Wari amahirwe ye ya nyuma yo kuvuga.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko aribyo.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It was all about him.	Byari byose kuri we.
Beyond the outside.	Kurenza no hanze.
I have a good plan to go	Mfite gahunda nziza yo kugenda
He thought he had to live.	Yatekereje ko yagombaga kubaho.
I had friends	Nari mfite inshuti
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi uko ni ko byagenze.
I doubt that is possible.	Ndashidikanya ko ibyo bishoboka.
Good first book.	Igitabo cyiza cya mbere.
I think the plan is good	Ntekereza ko gahunda ari nziza
I know you're close.	Nzi ko uri hafi aha.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
I should have thought	Nari nkwiye gutekereza
I knew your whole family	Nari nzi umuryango wawe wose
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I have a lot to go on	Mfite byinshi byo kugenda
And he must have.	Kandi agomba kugira.
Why?	Kuki?
And that was great.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza cyane.
I didn’t think he was.	Sinatekerezaga ko ari we.
I have to be bad	Ngomba kuba mubi
I thought you were my friend too	Natekereje ko nawe uri inshuti yanjye
I know what you think	Nzi icyo utekereza
I knew the girl who did it	Nari nzi umukobwa wabikoze
I have the same problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe
I saw that he was right	Nabonye ko afite ukuri
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
I really wanted to	Nashakaga cyane
Probably, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka.
No one needed to know.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ukeneye kumenya.
Someone we can live with	Umuntu dushobora kubana
You can't see anything.	Ntushobora kubona ikintu na kimwe.
I know you may find it difficult	Nzi ko ushobora kumva ko bigoye
He said it was possible.	Yavuze ko bishoboka.
He said nothing.	Ntacyo yavuze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bihagije kuri ubu.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I was very embarrassed, however	Nagize isoni cyane, ariko
I didn't know at all	Ntabwo nari nzi na gato
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
I should quit now	Nkwiye kureka ubu
You can be really bad.	Urashobora kuba mubi rwose.
That person can do as he pleases.	Uwo muntu arashobora kubikora uko ashaka.
Not tonight.	Ntabwo iri joro.
I think that's a good thing	Ndakeka ko aricyo kintu cyiza
I don't know what it is	Sinzi icyo aricyo
It's good that you did it.	Nibyiza kuba wabikoze.
I think it was possible	Ntekereza ko byari bishoboka
I really don't know how	Ntabwo rwose nzi uburyo
I have no time for that.	Ntabwo mfite umwanya kubyo.
It’s not just food.	Ntabwo ari ibiryo gusa.
He can't take anything else.	Ntashobora gufata ikindi kintu.
I enjoyed my time	Nishimiye umwanya wanjye
You can't eat one of them right now.	Ntushobora kurya kimwe muri byo ubu.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
He looked bad.	Yasaga naho ari mubi.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I should take the money	Nkwiye gufata amafaranga
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
And, of course, this is exactly what happened.	Kandi, mubyukuri, ibi nibyo.
You really have to come tomorrow.	Ugomba rwose kuza ejo.
And she was a beautiful woman.	Kandi yari umugore mwiza.
He looked worried	Yarebye impungenge
You can't be home.	Ntushobora kuba murugo.
I can't be better.	Sinshobora kuba mwiza.
I didn't want to read that	Sinifuzaga gusoma ibyo
They have none.	Ntabwo bafite.
But everything is fine.	Ariko ibintu byose ni byiza.
This is really good.	Ibi rwose ni byiza.
He could have said he needed someone like him.	Yashoboraga kuvuga ko akeneye umuntu nka we.
I can only	Nshobora gusa
Obviously that is not the case.	Biragaragara ko ibyo atari ukuri.
It was really good.	Mubyukuri byari byiza.
He was gone quickly.	Yari yagiye vuba.
And it’s good to win.	Kandi ni byiza gutsinda.
I have an idea to do it now.	Mfite igitekerezo cyo kubikora ubu.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
We have to do it now.	Tugomba kubikora ubu.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndakeka ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
I don't think that's true.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari ukuri.
I thought a lot.	Natekerezaga cyane.
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu ashobora kuba afite
I had my meeting this morning	Nagize inama yanjye muri iki gitondo
You and I.	Wowe na njye.
Only one time.	Igihe kimwe gusa.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
I want to know more.	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi.
I was sure it would be nice	Nari nzi neza ko byaba byiza
I’ve seen a lot of that	Nabonye byinshi muri byo
It was you.	Wari wowe.
I can't go	Sinshobora kugenda
I want to, however.	Ndashaka, ariko.
I know you like to work alone	Nzi ko ukunda gukora wenyine
That's what he said.	Nibyo yavuze.
He seemed young.	Yasaga naho ari muto.
I guess you can.	Ndakeka yuko ushobora.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I don't know who he is	Ntabwo nzi uwo ari we
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I can't hear a boy alone	Sinshobora kumva umuhungu wenyine
I know it's hard.	Nzi ko bigoye.
I didn't think about that	Ntabwo natekerezaga kuri ibyo
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
I guess we should see.	Ndakeka ko tugomba kubona.
That's right.	Nukuri.
He is absolutely right.	Afite ukuri rwose.
I didn't see what it was	Ntabwo nabonye icyo aricyo
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
It's all me.	Byose ni njye.
I’ve seen a lot of that.	Nabonye byinshi muri byo.
He didn't want to hear.	Ntiyashakaga kumva.
I guess that's possible.	Ndakeka ko bishoboka.
He was a bad person.	Yari umuntu mubi.
No, obviously.	Ntabwo ariko, biragaragara.
He did.	Yabikoze.
Buri.	Buri.
This is obvious.	Ibi biragaragara.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
One has to take the child.	Umuntu agomba gufata umwana.
I have to think.	Ngomba gutekereza.
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
That's just fine	Nibyiza gusa
Not in time.	Ntabwo ari mugihe.
He wanted to do it on his own.	Yashakaga kubikora wenyine.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
I needed time.	Nari nkeneye umwanya.
He wanted to see people.	Yashakaga kubona abantu.
I have never seen anyone like me	Ntabwo nigeze mbona umuntu nkanjye
I thought it would be nice.	Natekereje ko byaba byiza.
Just scary.	Gusa ubwoba.
I was just a kid at the time	Icyo gihe nari umwana gusa
Quit.	Kureka.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
That's good.	Nibyo byiza.
I wanted to be out here	Nashakaga kuba hanze aha
I knew he had a lot.	Nari nzi ko afite byinshi.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
He started reading the book.	Yatangiye gusoma igitabo.
It’s all fun and beautiful.	Byose ni ibirori kandi byiza.
You don’t have to take long.	Ntugomba gufata igihe kirekire.
You don't have to do this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi.
I can wait a while	Nshobora gutegereza igihe gito
It is a very good car.	Ni imodoka nziza cyane.
If they have time.	Niba bafite umwanya.
I'm going to stay behind	Ngiye kuguma inyuma
And this is exactly what happened.	Kandi ibi mubyukuri.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
We have to look ahead	Tugomba kureba imbere
Everything is the way it is	Ibintu byose ni uburyo
How can I overcome this problem.	Nigute nshobora gutsinda iki kibazo.
He was not going to do it again.	Ntabwo yari agiye kongera kubikora.
I have to wait for tomorrow	Ngomba gutegereza ejo
He never heard of anything.	Nta kintu yigeze yumva.
It's just small.	Ni muto gusa.
Getting it wrong.	Kubona gukora amakosa.
I don't know how good it is.	Ntazi uko ari mwiza.
Really inside.	Nukuri imbere.
But this morning he was well aware, if not earlier.	Ariko muri iki gitondo yari azi neza, niba atari mbere.
All you think about is work.	Ibyo utekereza byose ni akazi.
He used to walk whenever possible.	Yakundaga kugenda igihe cyose bishoboka.
I can't think.	Sinshobora gutekereza.
He wanted to say more.	Yashakaga kuvuga byinshi.
I want to hear why	Ndashaka kumva impamvu
Not bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi.
I'm going to see.	Ngiye kureba.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
Same problem, though.	Ikibazo kimwe, naho.
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo aricyo.
And you don’t have to.	Kandi ntugomba.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I just didn’t know what you were thinking about this	Gusa sinari nzi ko utekereza kuri ibi
Everything he said was true.	Ibyo yavuze byose byari ukuri.
He had a job for me.	Yari afite akazi kuri njye.
It's the same with us.	Ni kimwe natwe.
I guess it's you	Ndakeka ko ari wowe
I can't even see clearly.	Sinshobora no kubona neza.
And it's good.	Kandi ni mwiza.
But it’s not just time.	Ariko ntabwo ari umwanya gusa.
He is trying to do more.	Arimo kugerageza gukora byinshi.
Finally a girl.	Amaherezo umukobwa.
I can't go	Ntabwo nshobora kugenda
Probably no one knew who he was.	Birashoboka ko nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi uwo ari we.
I want to be with you	Ndashaka kubana nawe
You can do it yourself.	Urashobora kubikora wenyine.
I think it's good	Ntekereza ko ari byiza
I didn't know it was possible	Sinari nzi ko bishoboka
It may take time.	Birashoboka gufata igihe.
What you said	Ibyo wavuze.
I was young, and I needed a job	Nari muto, kandi nkeneye akazi
I have no faith.	Ntacyo nizera.
That, of course, is not the case with him.	Ibyo biragaragara ko atari ukuri kuri we.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
I think the clothes are good	Ntekereza ko imyenda ari nziza
It's good, it's good, it's good.	Nibyiza, byiza, byiza.
I don’t want to stay in it	Sinshaka kuguma muri yo
This is exactly what happened.	Ibi rwose nibyo.
The child was bad.	Umwana yari mubi.
I don't know what he said	Sinzi icyo yavuze
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
I thought he was behind me	Natekereje ko yari inyuma yanjye
I want to go home	Ndashaka gutaha
You have to find someone.	Ugomba kubona umuntu.
I can't see what he's talking about	Sinshobora kubona icyo avuga
I think that's true	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri
I feel like you can come home soon	Ndumva ushobora gutaha vuba
It's very similar to him.	Birasa cyane na we.
He got what he wanted.	Yabonye icyo ashaka.
It was an easy task.	Byari ibintu byoroshye gukora.
It was a car.	Yari imodoka.
I did well in school.	Nakoze neza mu ishuri.
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu ibyo aribyo
Apparently that was not what he wanted to hear.	Biragaragara ko atari byo yashakaga kumva.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I thought everything would be fine	Natekerezaga ko ibintu byose bizaba byiza
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
This, however, is not the case.	Ibi ariko, sibyo.
I thought, nothing at all	Natekereje, nta kintu na kimwe rwose
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
All of this is true.	Ibi byose ni ukuri.
I want to say a lot about that house	Ndashaka kuvuga byinshi kuri iyo nzu
I hope everything went well	Nizere ko byose byagenze neza
He is at work.	Ari ku kazi.
I think you have to do it	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kubikora
I wonder why he does it	Ndabaza impamvu abikora
I heard enough.	Numvise bihagije.
I thought you were something else	Natekereje ko uri ikindi kintu
I didn't know you were going to do this right now	Sinari nzi ko ugiye gukora ibi nonaha
You said it was far away.	Wavuze ko ari kure.
I feel the same way	Nanjye ndumva ibintu kimwe
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
I don't know if that's the case.	Sinzi niba aribyo.
I wanted to go out.	Nashakaga hanze.
It is not very low, and it is not very high.	Ntabwo ari hasi cyane, kandi ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
I feel it was really good.	Numva byari byiza rwose.
The woman does not hear.	Umugore ntabwo yumva.
I really have a plan	Mfite rwose gahunda
If it was good.	Niba byari byiza.
Only I can do this.	Ninjye wenyine ushobora gukora ibi.
It will not be tomorrow.	Ntabwo bizaba ejo.
I don't want money.	Ntabwo nshaka amafaranga.
There is nothing to eat.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kurya.
I shouldn't go back home	Ntabwo nkwiye gusubira mu nzu
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
He wanted to make more money.	Yashakaga kubona amafaranga menshi.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
I want to hear everything.	Ndashaka kumva byose.
His wife seemed embarrassed.	Umugore we yasaga naho afite isoni.
Only this time, it's good.	Gusa iki gihe, nibyiza.
That's not a problem for me.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri njye.
I know what it is, after all	Nzi icyo aricyo, nyuma ya byose
He looked back.	Yarebye inyuma.
I didn't know what he meant at the time	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga icyo gihe
He needed to see if anyone was inside.	Yari akeneye kureba niba hari umuntu uri imbere.
A young dog.	Umwana muto imbwa.
I don't believe that's true.	Ntabwo nizera ko aribyo rwose.
It was simple enough.	Byari byoroshye bihagije.
The top is the bottom.	Hejuru ni hasi.
Much to think about here	Byinshi byo gutekereza hano
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
I wanted the kids to be with me	Nashakaga ko abana nanjye
In the movie.	Ni firime.
Not very good at that.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane kuri ibyo.
I think so too.	Ndatekereza ko na we ari.
I just need a little time	Nkeneye gusa umwanya muto
I don't want to wait.	Sinshaka gutegereza.
It started at a very young age.	Yatangiye akiri muto cyane.
She just feels better.	Yumva gusa neza.
I'm not sure what he does.	Sinzi neza icyo akora.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Great to see.	Nibyiza cyane kubona.
I heard what happened	Numvise uko byagenze
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
I wanted to know more	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi
I thought he was	Natekereje ko ari we
It's not close, in fact.	Ntabwo ari hafi, mubyukuri.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
I was so beautiful	Nari mwiza cyane
It's all together.	Ni byose hamwe.
I'm sure nothing	Nzi neza ko ntacyo
I should have been closer to you	Nari nkwiye kuba hafi yawe
You have to live.	Ugomba kubaho.
I wanted to eat more.	Nashakaga kurya byinshi.
I know what happened.	Nzi uko byagenze.
A lot of people were out tonight.	Abantu benshi bari hanze iri joro.
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.
No one had much.	Nta muntu wari ufite byinshi.
It would not have been easy.	Ntabwo yari gutsinda byoroshye.
I didn't need anyone	Ntabwo nari nkeneye umuntu
I know what happened	Nzi uko byagenze
My phone is not.	Terefone yanjye ntabwo.
I really needed a plan	Nari nkeneye gahunda rwose
Until recently it was not true.	Kugeza vuba aha ntabwo byari ukuri.
I hope he is your son	Nizera ko ari umuhungu wawe
Yesterday I heard about him	Ejo numvise kuri we
I work on that every day.	Nkora kuri ibyo buri munsi.
'To'.	'Kuri'.
I really need a job	Nkeneye cyane akazi
I heard his opinion	Numvise igitekerezo cye
I never saw that movie	Sinigeze mbona iyo firime
A very small thing.	Ikintu gito cyane.
'	'
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
But it is not very close.	Ariko ntabwo ari hafi cyane.
I never wanted this house	Sinigeze nshaka iyi nzu
It was not difficult.	Ntabwo byari bigoye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
Well done.	Nibyiza ariko.
I didn't see it this time.	Ntabwo nabonye iki gihe.
Trying to help.	Kugerageza gufasha.
I was a little girl	Nari umukobwa muto
I have no house.	Nta nzu mfite.
I thought so badly	Natekereje nabi cyane
I love living with you	Nkunda kubana nawe
I mean, obviously.	Ndashaka kuvuga, biragaragara.
I was scared to be here like that	Nari mfite ubwoba bwo kuba hano gutya
I haven't seen it since morning	Sinigeze mbona kuva mu gitondo
I never felt wise	Sinigeze numva ubwenge
I just heard what you wanted	Gusa numvise icyo ushaka
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
I should have had a job	Nari nkwiye kugira akazi
But I don’t know how to do it.	Ariko sinzi kubikora.
He could have gone tonight.	Yashoboraga kugenda muri iri joro.
Or the same.	Cyangwa kimwe.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane
She has hair.	Afite umusatsi.
I’m glad of that, actually	Nishimiye ibyo, mubyukuri
However, that is clearly not the case.	Ariko, biragaragara ko ibyo atari ukuri.
Everything was going well for him.	Ibintu byose byari byagenze neza kuri we.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo rwose nzi neza.
And they are scared.	Kandi bafite ubwoba.
There is a woman here.	Hano hari umugore.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari benshi.
Bad day	Umunsi mubi.
I was a boy.	Nari umuhungu.
I know a lot of things	Nzi ibintu byinshi
He didn't seem to know anyone.	Ntabwo yasaga naho azi umuntu.
He has no reason to know.	Nta mpamvu agomba kumenya.
He was a good child.	Yari umwana mwiza.
All of this is possible.	Ibi byose birashoboka.
I have a house nearby	Mfite inzu hafi
I know exactly what he is doing	Nzi neza icyo akora
If they are lucky.	Niba bafite amahirwe.
I have to	Ngomba kuva ubu
I just want to be.	Ndashaka gusa kuba.
If he is lucky.	Niba afite amahirwe.
I did something today	Uyu munsi hari icyo nakoze
I wondered what to do	Natekereje icyo gukora
I always have to work	Buri gihe ngomba gukora
I didn’t think he would do it	Sinatekerezaga ko yari kubikora
I want to know what he wants	Ndashaka kumenya icyo ashaka
He said you were good too.	Yavuze ko nawe wari mwiza.
I don't want to leave this time	Sinshaka kuva muri iki gihe
It's a great opportunity.	Ni amahirwe menshi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu tugomba gukora.
I'm glad he did	Nishimiye ko yabikoze
We really need to go !!!.	Mubyukuri dukeneye kugenda !!!.
You have no children.	Ntabwo ufite abana.
I hear a lot today	Ndumva byinshi muri iki gihe
I'm glad I did	Nishimiye ko nakoze
That's really good	Nibyiza rwose
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo rwose.
I can't figure out what he thinks	Sinshobora kumenya icyo atekereza
It's down.	Ndi hasi.
But we can't go back now.	Ariko ntidushobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
Or try to do it.	Cyangwa kugerageza kubikora.
He started to feel like he was making a movie.	Yatangiye kumva asa nkaho akora firime.
I thought you were my friend	Natekereje ko uri inshuti yanjye
I ask what he thought he meant.	Ndabaza icyo yatekerezaga yashakaga kuvuga.
'he said.	' yavuze.
A very beautiful woman.	Umugore mwiza cyane.
They were very close	Bari hafi cyane
I never felt that the latter was a problem	Sinigeze numva ko aba nyuma ari ikibazo
I have no house	Nta nzu mfite
I guess he could have done worse	Ndakeka ko yashoboraga gukora nabi
I could never do that	Sinigeze nshobora kubikora
Eventually he came close to hearing this well.	Amaherezo yaje hafi yo kumva iyi neza.
I think that's the best thing for everyone	Ntekereza ko aricyo cyiza kuri buri wese
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
This is not the case.	Ntabwo ari iyi.
I saw things and heard things	Nabonye ibintu kandi numvise ibintu
It is not a very bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi cyane.
Not good, but close.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko hafi.
I also have a place to think at home	Mfite kandi aho ntekereza murugo
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
That's a lot of people.	Ibyo ni abantu benshi.
I am very young.	Ndi muto cyane.
I can do anything here	Nshobora gukora ikintu cyose hano
I work hard.	Nkora cyane.
He is behind me.	Ari inyuma yanjye.
I think you should go now	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kugenda ubu
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
I have a car, nice and early	Mfite imodoka, nziza kandi kare
And obviously it's a good gift.	Kandi biragaragara ko ari impano nziza.
I was not sure what he said	Ntabwo nari nzi neza ibyo yavuze
I like to play this movie	Nkunda gukina iyi firime
I had everything for me.	Nari mfite byose kuri njye.
Big and good.	Kinini kandi cyiza.
It wasn’t a lot of it, but it was something.	Ntabwo byari byinshi muri byo, ariko byari ikintu.
That would have gone before, in fact.	Ibyo byari kugenda mbere, mubyukuri.
Everything he could see was easy.	Ibyo yashoboraga kubona byose byari byoroshye.
I need this question	Nkeneye iki kibazo
Good time, good time	Igihe cyiza, cyiza
I don't want to be away from you	Sinshaka kuba kure yawe
Probably not, but.	Birashoboka ko atari benshi, ariko.
You want to see everything.	Urashaka kubona byose.
I have never seen so many things	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ibintu byinshi
It was a great experience to be there	Byari ibintu byiza cyane kuba ahari
People you can trust.	Abantu ushobora kwizera.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Waiting and waiting.	Gutegereza no gutegereza.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
I love how it happened.	Nkunda uko byagenze.
And that would be for me.	Kandi ibyo byaba kuri njye.
I was not sure what to do with the boy	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora umuhungu
I just knew you had to go back	Nari nzi gusa ko ugomba gusubira
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
I've seen enough.	Nabonye bihagije.
I like to film	Nkunda gukina firime
He was going to do it.	Yari agiye kubikora.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
You are.	Urimo.
Obviously you are also an expert.	Biragaragara rwose ko nawe ari umuhanga.
I have to think for a long time	Ngomba gutekereza ku gihe kirekire
Maybe this will be fine.	Ahari ibi bizaba byiza.
I think they are on me	Ndatekereza ko bari kuri njye
That’s where he was, and where he should be.	Ni aho yari ari, n'aho agomba no kuba.
I have children.	Mfite abana.
They have a job.	Bafite akazi.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
He is who he is and who he is.	Niwe uwo ari we kandi uwo ari we.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I don't believe in my daughter	Ntabwo nizera umukobwa wanjye
I had something else	Nari mfite ikindi kintu
It is absolutely impossible to go back to work.	Ntabwo bishoboka rwose gusubira ku kazi.
I knew you were here.	Nari nzi ko uri hano.
I think he would.	Ntekereza ko yari kubikora.
I thought we should be a family	Natekerezaga ko tugomba kuba umuryango
I can't give up.	Sinshobora kureka.
I think this is a good idea.	Ntekereza ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza.
If that's what you want.	Niba aribyo ushaka.
Not soon.	Ntabwo ari vuba.
I just don't know what to think.	Gusa sinzi uko utekereza bihagije kuvuga.
I don't want money	Sinshaka amafaranga
We have to be.	Tugomba kuba.
I was very lucky	Nagize amahirwe cyane
I want to make a mistake	Ndashaka gukora amakosa
You like to talk.	Ukunda kuvuga.
Above.	Hejuru ya hejuru.
I have no phone.	Nta terefone nanjye.
I just knew he would be there	Nari nzi gusa ko azaba ahari
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
'.	'.
I guess he knows what he's doing	Ndakeka ko azi ibyo akora
No one has ever been.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira.
Sometimes it's good.	Rimwe na rimwe ni byiza.
I didn't even want to think about it	Sinifuzaga no gutekereza kubyo bishoboka
I feel it.	Ndumva yumva.
My friend went to do things.	Inshuti yanjye yagiye gukora ibintu.
I'm happy today	Nishimiye uyu munsi
But there is one thing you can do.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe ushobora gukora.
He did.	Yabikoze.
That would be very difficult now.	Ibyo byaba bigoye cyane ubu.
Most of the time, in fact.	Igihe kinini, mubyukuri.
I haven't seen much	Sinigeze mbona byinshi
I have another problem.	Mfite ikindi kibazo.
Doing something good.	Gukora ikintu cyiza.
I can only be his friend	Nshobora kuba inshuti ye gusa
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
He thought quickly.	Yatekereje vuba.
It’s a job, it’s just a job.	Ni akazi, ni akazi gusa.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekereje neza.
The young man took the gift.	Umusore yafashe impano.
I mean it was.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko byari.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Like his father, who.	Kimwe na se, uwo.
I mean, everything so far is true.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibintu byose kugeza ubu ni ukuri.
I can't think of anything wrong with that	Sinshobora gutekereza ko ibyo byose ari amakosa yanjye
I know what he knows	Nzi ibyo azi
Why? 	Kuki?
I knew all that	Nari nzi ibyo byose
I do something to eat	Nkora icyo kurya
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
Here.	Hano.
I didn’t know, inside	Sinari nzi, imbere
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
I can't see the problem	Sinshobora kubona ko hari ikibazo
I'm not sure how.	Ntabwo nzi neza uburyo.
Absolutely scary.	Rwose ubwoba.
Not when you look like that.	Ntabwo iyo usa gutya.
I didn’t need to go back	Sinari nkeneye gusubira inyuma
To.	Kuri.
What he did.	Ibyo yakoze.
He said that was good.	Yavuze ko ibyo ari byiza.
He did not need to be at work at the time.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kuba ku kazi icyo gihe.
I think he did.	Ntekereza ko yabikoze.
Just one day.	Umunsi umwe gusa.
I shouldn't have said that	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuvuga
I need to know if he is still here	Nkeneye kumenya niba akiri hano
They were upstairs.	Bari hejuru.
Live well.	Kubaho neza.
I feel it every night	Ndumva buri joro
I hope it's easy soon	Ndizera ko byoroshye vuba
I don't see any mistakes.	Ntabwo mbona amakosa.
I understand what it is.	Ndumva icyo aricyo.
I mean, you want to tell someone	Ndashaka kuvuga, ushaka kubwira umuntu
I needed to see	Nari nkeneye kubona
At work and at work.	Ku kazi no kuva ku kazi.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
Is it ok 	Nibyiza?
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
I found things to do here	Nabonye ibintu byo gukora hano
A short time.	Igihe gito.
You need time.	Ukeneye igihe.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, niba yari, ntabwo byagenze.
I knew my son.	Nari nzi umuhungu wanjye.
He is not like him.	Ntabwo ari nka we.
That's really good for us.	Nibyiza rwose kuri twe.
I knew he had the truth	Nari nzi ko afite ukuri
I had a nice car.	Nari mfite imodoka nziza.
I didn't get a job today	Nta kazi nabonye uyu munsi
It looks good on me.	Birasa neza kuri njye.
I really think we can have something together	Ndatekereza rwose ko dushobora kugira ikintu hamwe
I think you can go now	Ndatekereza ko ushobora kugenda ubu
I was very embarrassed	Nagize isoni cyane
I thought of one thing	Natekereje ku kintu kimwe
I was looking for food	Nashakaga ibiryo
I can't really think	Sinshobora gutekereza rwose
I know what you mean	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
There is not much to it.	Nta byinshi kuri byo.
Meditation and meditation.	Gutekereza no gutekereza.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
I never wanted to.	Sinigeze nshaka.
Who knew when.	Ninde wari uzi igihe.
I had things for me	Nari mfite ibintu kuri njye
He did not know what he wanted to achieve.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo yashakaga kubaho.
I think he loves people.	Ntekereza ko akunda abantu.
I also think we have to go tonight	Ndatekereza kandi ko tugomba kugenda muri iri joro
But he also has problems.	Ariko na we afite ibibazo.
Everything is fine.	Ikintu cyose nta cyiza.
But for him that was enough.	Ariko kuri we ibyo byari bihagije.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
I was a young child	Nari umwana muto
If true.	Niba ari ukuri.
I really think he is	Ndatekereza rwose ko ari we
I want to go home and see my family	Ndashaka gutaha kureba umuryango wanjye
Definitely one woman.	Rwose umugore umwe.
He looked closely.	Yarebye cyane.
He was.	Yari we.
I wanted to help now	Nashakaga gufasha nonaha
Today, he was not aware of anything.	Uyu munsi, ntiyari azi neza ikintu na kimwe.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I needed it here.	Nari nkeneye hano.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I hope it was good	Nizere ko byari byiza
I wasn’t too close, mind	Ntabwo nari hafi cyane, ubwenge
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
I know you can do work	Nzi ko ushobora gukora akazi
Or maybe it is.	Cyangwa ahari birashoboka.
Probably not all.	Birashoboka ko atari byose.
She knew in that look that he had failed her.	Yari azi icyo umwana yumva.
The interior is absolutely beautiful.	Imbere ni nziza rwose.
He has a family to think about.	Afite umuryango wo gutekereza.
But once he did, he was in it.	Ariko amaze kubikora, yari arimo.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
If true, he did not own a car.	Niba ari ukuri, ntabwo yari afite imodoka.
We have to go home.	Tugomba gutaha.
I wanted what they had	Nashakaga ibyo bafite
Until, finally, finally.	Kugeza, amaherezo, amaherezo.
She was a beautiful woman.	Yari umugore mwiza.
I found him smart.	Nabonye afite ubwenge.
I mean, getting to know someone	Ndashaka kuvuga, kumenya umuntu
I knew he needed help	Nari nzi ko akeneye ubufasha
I have nothing today	Ntacyo mfite uyu munsi
It's worse than that.	Ari mubi cyane kurenza ibyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
He didn’t really want to do it.	Ntiyashakaga rwose kubikora.
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
You can get out of this.	Urashobora kuva muri ibi.
Getting more.	Kubona byinshi.
I want the truth	Ndashaka ukuri
She enjoyed reading the book	Yishimiye gusoma igitabo
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
I was so beautiful	Nari mwiza cyane
I didn't need anything	Ntacyo nari nkeneye
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
He was very skilled.	Yari umuhanga cyane.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
Above all.	Kurenza byose.
But it happened.	Ariko byagenze.
I don't deserve it.	Ntabwo nkwiye.
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
At home.	Murugo.
However, it is not good to read.	Ariko, ntabwo ari byiza gusoma.
He didn't even want to be his friend.	Ntiyashakaga no kuba inshuti ye.
He had a lot to drink.	Yari afite byinshi byo kunywa.
I knew he would do it	Nari nzi ko azabikora
Luckily for me.	Amahirwe yaje kuri njye.
I think you need time alone	Ndatekereza ko ukeneye umwanya wenyine
This is a good reason to go.	Iyi ni impamvu nziza yo kugenda.
I can't get enough of it	Sinshobora kugenda neza bihagije
I trust the player.	Nizera umukinnyi.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
He thought there was everything.	Yatekereje ko ahari byose.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
I needed to trust everyone	Nari nkeneye kwizera abantu bose
Many friends.	Inshuti nyinshi.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
That's not difficult.	Ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
Good player.	Umukinnyi mwiza.
We are here to help !.	Turi hano gufasha!.
We were a close family.	Twari umuryango wa hafi.
She was very beautiful at the time.	Icyo gihe yari mwiza cyane.
Baby, that's what he said	Umwana, nibyo yavuze
I have to find a way to do it	Ngomba gushaka uburyo bwo kubikora
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari kuba.
I had a friend, a friend	Nari mfite inshuti, inshuti
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I didn't know anything	Ntacyo nari nzi neza
One by one, you said.	Umwe kuri umwe, wavuze.
Coming soon.	Kuza vuba.
There is no stopping now.	Nta guhagarika ubu.
He was a young man.	Yari umuntu muto.
All the best.	Ibintu byose byiza.
It would be.	Byaba.
I did what he did.	Nakoze ibyo yakoze.
If you don't want to.	Niba udashaka.
I did a lot of bad things	Nakoze ibintu byinshi nabi
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
I always have a lot to do.	Buri gihe mfite ibintu byinshi byo gukora.
We couldn't have imagined.	Ntabwo twari dushobora gutekereza.
I love helping children	Nkunda cyane gufasha abana
I don’t want to say how to say it.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga uburyo bwo kuvuga.
What is above.	Hejuru ni iki.
I don't want to stay here	Sinshaka kuguma hano
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Ahari, ahari, ahari.
In the end it would be better.	Amaherezo byaba byiza.
Really, I really wanted to	Nukuri, nashakaga rwose
I think he is a good guy.	Ntekereza ko ari umusore mwiza.
I don’t think everyone should live that way.	Ntabwo mbona ko umuntu wese agomba kubaho gutya.
You.	Wowe.
We were just people	Twari abantu gusa
I feel really bad	Ndumva mubi rwose
That is the only problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo kimwe gusa.
They were his children.	Bari abana be.
He could, however, study.	Yashoboraga ariko kwiga.
I know who he is	Nzi umuntu uwo ari we
We don’t have to try.	Ntabwo tugomba kugerageza.
For him, very soon.	Kuri we, vuba cyane.
In fact, it's good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza.
I don't mean now.	Sinshaka kuvuga nonaha.
I found the truth	Nabonye ukuri
This was really good.	Ibi byari byiza rwose.
I had nothing to do with this	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo gukora ibi
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
The truth is, there are many.	Ukuri ni, hariho benshi.
We have a lot to do.	Dufite ibintu byinshi byo gukora.
I am a child.	Ndi umwana.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I know people.	Nzi abantu.
I can do anything here	Nshobora gukora ikintu cyose hano
You need help here.	Urashaka ubufasha hano.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
You know he's not.	Uzi ko atari we.
I guess he knew what he was talking about	Ndakeka ko yari azi ibyo avuga
I didn't think about that	Ntabwo natekereje kuri ibyo
I know a lot of people	Nzi abantu benshi
I just didn’t want my family to have to do it.	Gusa sinifuzaga ko umuryango wanjye ugomba kubikora.
I don't know what this is all about	Ntabwo nzi icyo ibi bishoboka
I was for a while.	Nari mugihe gito.
You would know what to do.	Wari kumenya icyo gukora.
I have to do something	Ngomba gukora ikintu
He was on the phone.	Yari kuri terefone.
I know it's true	Nzi ko ari ukuri
Maybe they have a bad day.	Birashoboka ko bafite umunsi mubi.
Eating good food.	Kurya ibiryo byiza.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
But he had to be her.	Ariko yagombaga kuba we.
I was not sure what time it was	Sinari nzi neza icyo aricyo gihe
The girl was right.	Umukobwa yari afite ukuri.
I thought he meant it	Natekereje ko yashakaga kuvuga
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I'm sure they were right about that.	Nzi neza ko bari bafite ukuri kuri ibyo.
I needed to know better	Nari nkeneye kumenya neza
He started telling me who he was, what he did.	Yatangiye kumbwira uwo ari we, icyo yakoze.
No time, nothing good.	Nta gihe, nta kintu cyiza.
But they are not here today.	Ariko ntabwo bari hano uyu munsi.
I am here with you	Ndi hano hamwe nawe
I think it's in me	Ntekereza ko ari muri njye
I never understood why	Sinigeze numva impamvu yabikoze
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
It was all.	Yari byose.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I mean I will never.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ntazigera.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
But not this week.	Ariko si muri iki cyumweru.
Or just thinking.	Cyangwa gutekereza gusa.
I really think about that	Ndatekereza rwose kuri ibyo
I know they are here	Nzi ko bari hano
Everyone is everyone.	Abantu bose ni bose.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I'm going to buy something to drink.	Ngiye kugura ikintu cyo kunywa.
I know it would be a lot of people	Nzi ko byaba abantu benshi
I wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe
I can't do this again	Sinshobora kongera gukora ibi
One has to know who his father is	Umuntu agomba kumenya se uwo ari we
But that is not what he meant.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I had the same idea	Nari mfite igitekerezo kimwe
There is a lot of money here.	Hano hari amafaranga menshi.
I didn't know what it was	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo aricyo
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
They had none.	Ntabwo bari bafite.
I saw that one.	Nabonye uwo.
I just know how beautiful you are.	Nzi neza gusa uko uri mwiza.
Not really, or anything else.	Ntabwo aribyo, cyangwa ikindi kintu icyo aricyo cyose.
I wonder how old he is, actually	Ndabaza imyaka afite, mubyukuri
He can do whatever he wants.	Arashobora gukora icyo ashaka.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
I have a plan to do it	Mfite gahunda yo kubikora
Not once, never.	Ntabwo ari rimwe, nta na rimwe.
Kinini.	Kinini.
No one knew much about him.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi byinshi kuri we.
I have to leave early tomorrow	Ngomba kugenda kare ejo
We are children.	Turi abana.
But he had a problem.	Ariko yagize ikibazo.
I think it's easy to understand why.	Ntekereza ko byoroshye kumva impamvu.
We are not.	Ntabwo turi.
He is now buying time.	Ubu arimo kugura igihe.
And that is very good for me.	Kandi ko ari byiza cyane kuri njye.
See you now.	Kubona nonaha.
All would be well.	Byose byaba byiza.
I was a little above him now	Nari hejuru ye gato ubu
And here we are here.	Kandi hano turi hano.
I thought we were too far ahead	Natekerezaga ko turi kure cyane imbere
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will be.	Birashoboka ko atari uyu munsi, birashoboka ko atari ejo, ariko bizaba.
I had a very good idea who he was	Nari mfite igitekerezo cyiza cyane uwo ari we
You have to tell me what you want.	Ugomba kumbwira icyo ushaka.
He needed his father.	Yari akeneye se.
You can't play.	Ntushobora gukina.
I didn't have one	Ntabwo nari mfite
I was the only girl	Nari umukobwa wenyine
I think there is a lot to it	Ntekereza ko hari byinshi kuri byo
Here he was, in the end.	Hano yari, amaherezo.
I just have a problem	Mfite ikibazo gusa
I am your friend.	Ndi inshuti yawe.
This is not normal	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe
It will be good in the end.	Bizaba byiza amaherezo.
I just know it's not true	Gusa nzi ko atari ukuri
I hope he does well	Nizere ko akora neza
I can't stay here	Sinshobora kuguma hano
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I have problems.	Mfite ibibazo.
His father needs to talk to you.	Se akeneye kuvugana nawe.
I would be away from him.	Nari kuba kure ye.
'	'
On that day.	Kuri uwo munsi.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
I really don't see this.	Ntabwo rwose mbona ibi.
I always thought about doing it	Buri gihe natekerezaga kubikora
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
I needed to talk to someone	Nari nkeneye kuvugana numuntu
Ngomba.	Ngomba.
I had things for me.	Nari mfite ibintu kuri njye.
We have to go together and we need to stay together.	Tugomba kujyana kandi dukeneye kuguma hamwe.
He never went too far.	Ntiyigeze aba kure cyane.
No one saw the car or the people.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye imodoka cyangwa abantu.
I thought he was	Natekereje ko arimo
He did.	Yabikoze.
I didn't know what he was afraid of	Sinari nzi icyo yari afite ubwoba
Maybe tonight or tomorrow.	Birashoboka iri joro cyangwa ejo.
I want to do something	Ndashaka kugira icyo nkora
I need to know what someone is feeling.	Nkeneye kumenya icyo umuntu yumva.
It wasn’t as if he needed money.	Ntabwo byari nkaho akeneye amafaranga.
It is now.	Ubu ni.
You need to work on that.	Ukeneye gukora kuri ibyo.
Ari.	Ari.
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
What he doesn't mean.	Ibyo adashaka kuvuga.
He saw what he saw.	Yabonye ibyo yabonye.
I don’t want to stop studying	Sinshaka guhagarika kwiga
Obviously, none of this is good.	Biragaragara, nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari cyiza.
I definitely should stay here tonight	Nkwiye rwose kuguma hano iri joro
This was a great day.	Uyu wari umunsi mwiza.
I should have spoken sooner	Nari nkwiye kuvuga vuba
I had a problem finding any book	Nagize ikibazo cyo gushaka igitabo icyo ari cyo cyose
Not that he had a good thing to do.	Ntabwo ari uko yari afite ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Downstairs, now.	Hasi imbere, ubu.
I want to play with him	Ndashaka gukina na we
He does nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora.
No need to tell me.	Nta mpamvu yo kumbwira.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba gusa kuba mwiza.
Simple is good.	Byoroshye ni byiza.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
I had a beautiful girl	Nari mfite umukobwa mwiza
Here, he says nothing.	Hano, nta kintu na kimwe avuga.
I can't wait to go	Sinshobora gutegereza kugenda
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Nashakaga kumenya icyo yatekerezaga
It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
I can't take his time.	Sinshobora gufata umwanya we.
But he seemed happy.	Ariko yasaga naho yishimiye kuvuga.
But it happened.	Ariko byagenze.
But that is not all.	Ariko sibyo rwose.
I think having an idea is what it is	Ntekereza ko kugira igitekerezo aricyo
I like.	Nkunda.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I always need help	Buri gihe nkeneye ubufasha
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I didn't want to know who he was	Sinifuzaga kumenya uwo ari we
I can do things much better than before	Nshobora gukora ibintu neza cyane kuruta mbere
I think he likes the idea	Ntekereza ko akunda igitekerezo
I think everything is possible	Ntekereza ko byose bishoboka
Just the truth, well that's what you think.	Gusa ukuri, neza nibyo utekereza.
That seems difficult right now.	Ibyo birasa nkaho bigoye ubu.
He was a young man.	Yari umusore.
And that was enough.	Kandi ibyo byari bihagije.
Well we have a day.	Nibyiza dufite umunsi.
I am his wife.	Ndi umugore we.
I thought so	Natekereje ko aribyo
I have to read the book now!	Ngomba gusoma igitabo ubu!
You can do it yourself, of course.	Urashobora kubikora wenyine, rwose.
Tell me what to do.	Mbwira icyo gukora.
He knows everything.	Azi byose.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
I doubt it, though	Ndashidikanya ariko ko aribyo
I didn’t want to do it again	Sinifuzaga kongera kubikora
That's what he did.	Nibyo yakoze.
I also had money for me	Nanjye nari mfite amafaranga kuri njye
You can do it.	Ushobora kubikora.
I'm sorry to hear that	Mbabajwe no kuvuga ko ari ukuri
Girl.	Umukobwa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari vuba cyane.
I'm not sure though	Ntabwo nzi neza ariko
I wanted to know more.	Nashakaga kumenya neza.
They are both.	Bombi ni.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, ikintu ni gito.
Or who, if you must.	Cyangwa uwo, niba ugomba.
Or none at all.	Cyangwa nta na kimwe.
That is why we have.	Ni yo mpamvu dufite.
I love everyone.	Nkunda abantu bose.
He was ready to take action.	Yari yiteguye kugira icyo akora.
I wanted to give up everything	Nashakaga kureka byose
Big is good.	Kinini ni cyiza.
It is a matter of faith	Ni ikibazo cyo kwizera
But they have the money.	Ariko bafite amafaranga.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
They are in the same school.	Bari mu ishuri rimwe.
Today, someone was me.	Uyu munsi, umuntu yari njye.
You don't know what you want.	Ntabwo uzi icyo ushaka.
And he was close.	Kandi yari hafi.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
I never felt like doing it.	Sinigeze numva nshaka kubikora.
I want to see a good guy	Ndashaka kubona umusore mwiza
I have a problem here	Mfite ikibazo hano
I know what he wants	Nzi icyo ashaka
I thought it was good.	Natekerezaga ko byari byiza.
I knew there was more to it	Nari nzi ko hari byinshi kuri byo
He can't even speak.	Ntashobora no kuvuga.
I want to believe.	Ndashaka kwizera.
We have to take it as soon as possible.	Tugomba gufata vuba vuba.
But he knew people well.	Ariko yari azi abantu neza.
And nothing.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe.
I saw his daughter in the distance	Nabonye umukobwa we uri kure
I really should take the time	Nkwiye rwose gufata igihe
We need to know more about him.	Tugomba kumenya byinshi kuri we.
This was normal.	Ibi byari bisanzwe.
He will probably be here soon.	Birashoboka ko azaba hano vuba.
No one knows what he is doing.	Nta muntu n'umwe uzi icyo akora.
Very good stuff, very good !.	Ibintu byiza cyane, nibyiza cyane!.
I knew where he would be	Nari nzi aho azaba
It's great to watch.	Nibyiza cyane kureba.
I should go	Nkwiye kugenda
I'm glad you're here with me	Nishimiye ko uri hano hamwe nanjye
I'm glad you're here	Nishimiye ko uri hano
I think you need a regular look.	Ndatekereza ko ukeneye kureba bisanzwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I did wrong.	Nakoze nabi.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
Why? 	Kuki?
But so far, so good.	Ariko kugeza ubu, ni byiza cyane.
And he is eating a lot of good things.	Kandi arimo kurya byinshi byiza.
I didn't want to know anything else	Sinifuzaga kumenya ikindi kintu
You may not get the advice you need.	Ntushobora kubona inama ukeneye.
I think that's the way it is	Ntekereza ko aribyo kubaho
I didn’t want to think about this again	Sinifuzaga kongera gutekereza kuri ibi
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
I wanted him to go	Nashakaga ko agenda
To.	Kuri.
You are now here.	Ubu uri hano.
I don't know what.	Ntabwo nzi icyo.
I really needed it	Nari nkeneye cyane
I don’t want to think about this.	Sinshaka gutekereza kuri ibi.
Things would be better then.	Ibintu byaba byiza icyo gihe.
I can't wait to read	Sinshobora gutegereza gusoma
I'm going to drive.	Ngiye gutwara.
Trying things out.	Kugerageza ibintu.
I wanted to talk to him	Nashakaga kuvugana na we
He may eventually be alone.	Amaherezo arashobora kuba wenyine.
Not one of them.	Ntabwo ari kimwe muri byo.
I like what you said	Nkunda ibyo wavuze
I don't know what.	Ntabwo nzi icyo.
But since.	Ariko kuva.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
Something he had	Ikintu yari afite
We were inside.	Twari imbere.
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
I hope he went upstairs	Ndizera ko yagiye hejuru
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko mubyukuri.
He tried.	Yagerageje.
I'm sorry he left.	Mbabajwe nuko yagiye.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
In the room.	Mu cyumba.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
But it was normal.	Ariko byari bisanzwe.
I think he looks good, time	Ntekereza ko asa neza, igihe
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
Just once.	Rimwe gusa.
I had no choice	Ntabwo nari mfite uburyo
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
I don’t think of his age.	Ntabwo ntekereza imyaka ye.
I really enjoy eating.	Nishimiye cyane kurya.
I know how you do it	Nzi uko ukora
I can't figure out what it is	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya icyo aricyo
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane, mwiza.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
I didn't think so	Ntabwo natekerezaga
You can't get away from yourself.	Ntushobora kuva kure yawe wenyine.
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
He heard nothing.	Ntacyo yumvise.
That's not the problem here.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo hano.
I didn't think so	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo
He went where he was.	Yagiye aho ari.
I wanted to see.	Nashakaga kubona.
And he wanted to help.	Kandi yashakaga gufasha.
Opinion.	Igitekerezo.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
I always thought he was a good guy	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko ari umusore mwiza
I want to.	Ndashaka.
I didn't have to go back to work.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gusubira ku kazi.
I can't find anything to do	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu cyo gukora
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Mfite byinshi byo gukora ejo
I think you love the same	Ndatekereza ko ukunda kimwe
I can't even say what you look like.	Sinshobora no kuvuga uko usa.
And he's in the movie.	Kandi ari muri firime.
It was easy to see.	Kubona byari byoroshye.
That is very true here.	Ibyo ni ukuri cyane hano.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
I mean, it was good.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko byari byiza.
I don’t know why this is the case.	Sinzi impamvu ibi aribyo.
He should not have said anything.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kugira icyo avuga.
Almost everything, in fact.	Hafi ya byose, mubyukuri.
He never spoke.	Ntiyigeze avuga.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko atari byo.
You can find more.	Urashobora kubona byinshi.
I don't need anything	Ntacyo nkeneye
He has a very long time for us.	Afite igihe kirekire cyane kuri twe.
But not many.	Ariko si benshi.
I thought he could play	Natekerezaga ko ashobora gukina
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
He wants the truth.	Ashaka ukuri.
I know what he would say.	Nzi icyo yari kuvuga.
What he did.	Ibyo yakoze.
He was not in the room.	Ntiyari mu cyumba.
Like many.	Nka byinshi.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
Everything was that way.	Ibintu byose byari uko.
She was good at everything.	Yari mwiza muri byose.
I wanted to know more	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi
There is a house today.	Uyu munsi hari inzu.
Who would have thought ?.	Ninde wari gutekereza?.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
That's not really the case.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
No one knows where he is.	Nta muntu n'umwe uzi aho ari.
It was great to see the family.	Byari byiza kubona umuryango.
Yes, like.	Ari, nka.
The truth is, he didn't hear anything.	Ukuri nuko ntacyo yumvise.
I didn’t think he even wanted to talk to me	Sinatekerezaga ko ashaka no kuvugana nanjye
Everything here.	Byose hano.
I'm not really sure about that.	Ntabwo rwose nzi neza kuri ibyo.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kuri byose.
They would know what to do.	Bari kumenya icyo gukora.
I know how you like to read	Nzi uburyo ukunda gusoma
You have to ask carefully.	Ugomba gusaba neza.
I am at the moment.	Ndi kuri ubu.
I guess you know what he looks like	Ndakeka ko uzi uko asa
He would have gone.	Yaba yagiye.
A bad day was everything else	Umunsi mubi wari ikindi kintu cyose
I hope he does.	Ndizera ko abikora.
I like to work.	Nkunda gukora.
I did exactly what he said	Nakoze neza ibyo yavuze
It's good that I got a job.	Nibyiza ko mbona akazi.
You have to eat something.	Ugomba kurya ikintu.
I really like this.	Nkunda cyane ibi.
I am not and I cannot be	Ntabwo ndi kandi sinshobora kubaho
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
I guess not	Ndakeka ko atari byo
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I don't know, man.	Sinzi, muntu.
It's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
This is a great day out.	Uyu urimo kuba umunsi mwiza.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
I know he has.	Nzi ko afite.
It wasn’t just good.	Ntabwo byari byiza gusa.
That is exactly what he chose.	Ibyo na byo ni byo yahisemo.
There was nothing there.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari ahari.
I think he wants to talk to me	Ntekereza ko ashaka kuvugana nanjye
He was not human.	Ntabwo yari umuntu.
I wanted so much today	Nashakaga cyane muri iki gihe
.	.
I can't do everything.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora byose.
They were both good friends.	Bombi bari inshuti nziza.
I think quickly.	Ntekereza vuba.
But one day it was up to me	Ariko umunsi umwe byari kuri njye
There is my family.	Hariho umuryango wanjye.
Definitely the same.	Rwose birasa.
That is something else.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu.
And that's good enough.	Kandi ibyo nibyiza bihagije.
Bari.	Bari.
We just have to figure out how.	Tugomba gusa kumenya uburyo.
He asked for advice.	Yasabye inama.
It wasn't good enough.	Ntabwo byari byiza bihagije.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
I didn't know what to do tonight	Sinari nzi icyo gukora kuri iri joro
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I’m on something I don’t know exactly what it is.	Ndi ku kintu ntazi neza icyo aricyo.
You need help.	Ugomba kugira ubufasha.
He would be thirty years old.	Yaba afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
I didn’t want to take it	Ntabwo nashakaga gufata
We have to have.	Tugomba kugira.
It's down.	Ndi hasi.
They are good friends.	Ni inshuti nziza.
I'm glad his family is here	Nishimiye ko umuryango we uri hano
He wasn’t just scared.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba gusa.
That too.	Ibyo na byo.
There is something here for everyone.	Hano hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
I want to make it easier	Ndashaka kubikora byoroshye
Many have, true.	Benshi bafite, ukuri.
The young man of.	Umusore wa.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
So far he has.	Kugeza ubu afite.
He had done nothing.	Ntacyo yari yakoze.
I know enough to say	Nzi ibintu bihagije byo kuvuga
It was better than the truth.	Byari byiza kuruta ukuri.
And he had a great party.	Kandi yagize ibirori byiza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
And things go well.	Kandi ibintu akora neza.
Or your phone.	Cyangwa terefone yawe.
But that's enough.	Ariko bihagije kuri ibyo.
I hope he never wanted to.	Nizera ko atigeze ashaka.
I don't think they know who he is	Ntabwo ntekereza ko bazi uwo ari we
But I can't try.	Ariko ntashobora kugerageza.
I'm not sure about this	Ntabwo nzi neza ibi
I know how to read this	Nzi gusoma ibi
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, byari ukuri.
I can do it again	Nshobora kongera kubikora
It’s like a good movie.	Ni nka firime nziza.
I could never do that	Sinigeze nshobora kubikora
I can live with that	Nshobora kubana nibyo
But I don't know why.	Ariko ntazi impamvu.
I never knew what	Sinigeze nshobora kumenya icyo
I wanted something small, but not too small	Nashakaga ikintu gito, ariko ntabwo ari gito cyane
We have to take it.	Tugomba gufata.
But it would be nice.	Ariko byari kuba byiza.
I think that's true	Ntekereza ko ari ukuri
But, you have to do it right.	Ariko, ugomba kubikora neza.
I didn't want to hear anything wrong	Sinifuzaga kumva ikintu kibi
I like to do normal things	Nkunda gukora ibintu bisanzwe
It would not be a good idea to just stop.	Ntabwo byaba ari igitekerezo cyiza guhagarika gusa.
I just wanted to get a phone	Nashakaga gusa kubona terefone
He was just a good person.	Yari umuntu mwiza gusa.
I was one.	Nari umwe.
He was a very intelligent man.	Yari umuntu uzi ubwenge cyane.
I just know what he told me.	Nzi gusa ibyo yambwiye.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
I mean, yes, but it's not	Ndashaka kuvuga, ni, ariko sibyo
That's a long time.	Icyo ni igihe kirekire.
I'm not a little girl	Ntabwo ndi umukobwa muto
He could buy what he needed.	Yashoboraga kugura ibyo yari akeneye.
That's good right now.	Nibyiza kuri ubu.
The truth is.	Ukuri ni.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
He could see nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
He saw something else.	Yabonye ikindi kintu.
I enjoyed that time.	Nishimiye icyo gihe.
Oh, he doesn't know for sure.	We, ntabwo azi neza.
I'm not sure where	Sinzi neza aho hano
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
I was the only child	Nari umwana wenyine
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko vuba aha.
If it is good.	Niba ari mwiza.
But we have to trust someone.	Ariko tugomba kwizera umuntu.
Like his father.	Kimwe na se.
It was a beautiful day and everyone was outside.	Wari umunsi mwiza kandi abantu bose bari hanze.
I hear his opinion	Ndumva igitekerezo cye
But he tried.	Ariko yagerageje.
And later.	Kandi nyuma.
You and I.	Wowe na njye.
He heard nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yumvise.
It's just so good.	Gusa ni byiza cyane.
After all, if not now, when ?.	Nyuma ya byose, niba atari nonaha, ryari?.
I am very happy	Nishimiye cyane
I didn't want to study	Sinifuzaga kwiga
I needed to do something	Nari nkeneye gukora ikintu
I knew there was not much he could do	Nari nzi ko nta byinshi yashoboraga gukora
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Uzi neza ko udashaka.
When on top.	Iyo hejuru.
And that's almost all.	Kandi ibyo hafi ya byose.
For me, that’s not a good thing.	Kuri njye, ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda
I love my house here	Nkunda inzu yanjye hano
That's right.	Nibyo, ndi.
I have a lot to think about	Mfite byinshi byo gutekereza
You have to.	Ugomba.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I just thought you were	Natekereje gusa ko uri
And they were scared.	Kandi bari bafite ubwoba.
I know something else	Nzi ikindi kintu
I just didn't know why	Gusa sinari nzi impamvu
Sometimes they have mistakes.	Rimwe na rimwe bafite amakosa.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
I should never do anything with you	Ntabwo ngomba na rimwe kugira icyo nkora nawe
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
I want to stay longer.	Ndashaka kuguma igihe kirekire.
He was just a friend.	Yari umuntu gusa wo gushaka inshuti.
But he had to act quickly.	Ariko yagombaga gukora vuba.
I saw no problem	Nta kibazo nabonye
You don't know for sure.	Ntabwo uzi neza.
I heard enough.	Numvise bihagije.
As if he could hear what he was feeling.	Nkaho yashoboraga kumva icyo yumva.
I don’t want to take your time.	Sinshaka gufata umwanya wawe.
It’s not easy, obviously.	Ntabwo byoroshye, biragaragara.
I thought about the house, the clothes, the food	Natekereje ku nzu, imyenda, ibiryo
I didn't do much	Ntabwo nakoze byinshi
I saw no problem	Nta kibazo nabonye
I mean here	Ndashaka kuvuga hano
Someone here.	Hano hari umuntu.
He didn't want to be there.	Ntiyashakaga aho.
I want to know something else you saw	Ndashaka kumenya ikindi kintu wabonye
I don't.	Ntabwo.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
And everything was really good.	Kandi ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
He does this when he needs time to think.	Ibyo abikora mugihe akeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
We are outside.	Turi hanze.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He was here.	Hano yari.
I have you on the phone	Mfite wowe kuri terefone
I'm not a thinker.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu utekereza.
I need time.	Nkeneye umwanya.
I really need help	Nkeneye rwose ubufasha
I have a beautiful wife	Mfite umugore mwiza
It was just an idea.	Byari igitekerezo gusa.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
I have as many things as possible	Mfite ibintu byinshi bishoboka
I think you were right	Ntekereza ko wari ufite ukuri
That's the catch.	Nibyo gufata.
I'm bad	Ndi mubi
I really am.	Nukuri ndi.
Maybe he would do it now.	Birashoboka ko yari kubikora ubu.
Or maybe just one person.	Cyangwa ahari umuntu umwe gusa.
And the same thing.	Kandi ikintu kimwe.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I needed to see my son	Nari nkeneye kubona umuhungu wanjye
I hope you were scared too	Ndizera ko nawe yagize ubwoba
I want to help with that	Ndashaka gufasha muri ibyo
I could never do that	Sinigeze nshobora kubikora
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
He wanted more.	Yashakaga byinshi.
I don't know why this is	Ntabwo nzi impamvu ibi aribyo
I thought so	Natekereje ko aribyo
The only question is who.	Ikibazo gusa ninde.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
I saw that for him	Nabonye ibyo kuri we
In front of you, near you.	Imbere yawe, hafi yawe.
I never saw you do that with someone	Sinigeze mbona ukora ibyo hamwe numuntu
I don't know where he is	Ntabwo nzi aho ari
You don't know much here.	Ntabwo uzi neza hano.
I can't recommend this movie enough	Ntabwo nshobora gusaba iyi firime bihagije
I can't stop thinking about work	Sinshobora guhagarika gutekereza ku kazi
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
I was early	Nari kare kare
Stop playing.	Reka gukina.
Bad place today.	Umwanya mubi muri iki gihe.
Today in fact.	Uyu munsi mubyukuri.
Here today, he went yesterday.	Hano uyu munsi, yagiye ejo.
I never told anyone about this	Ntabwo nigeze mbwira umuntu uwo ari we wese kuri ibi
He knew exactly what he meant.	Yari azi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I wanted to live	Nashakaga kubaho
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
And sometimes.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe.
Bad day	Umunsi mubi.
You have to go and see what he says.	Ugomba kujya kureba ibyo yavuze.
I should have come home early, that's all	Nari nkwiye gutaha kare, nibyo byose
You, baby.	Wowe, umwana.
None of this I knew	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo nari nzi
We were not close.	Ntabwo twari hafi.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga kure
Probably the same here.	Birashoboka ko ari kimwe hano.
He said he needed to talk to me.	Yavuze ko akeneye kuvugana nanjye.
I really want to talk to you	Ndashaka rwose kuvugana nawe
I have to go to work	Ngomba kujya ku kazi
I know something he doesn't know	Nzi ikintu atazi
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That was me being the worst	Uwo yari njye mubi cyane
He knows nothing.	Nta cyo azi.
Meditation food you can talk about.	Ibiryo byo gutekereza ushobora kuvuga.
Look here or here	Kureba hano cyangwa hano
I am happy to buy.	Nishimiye kugura.
From afar.	Kuva kure.
It’s the same as being an actor.	Ni kimwe no kuba umukinnyi.
I'm not sure what that is.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo aricyo.
She is glad she has.	Yishimiye ko afite.
See you now.	Kubona nonaha.
But he is not.	Ariko we sibyo.
There is one who does not want to, however.	Hariho umwe adashaka, ariko.
He was also a child.	Na we yari umwana.
Here and there.	Hano na hano.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
I don't know the day	Sinzi umunsi
You were alone.	Wari wenyine.
We are very close now.	Turi hafi cyane kuri ubu.
Being here for a while.	Kuba hano igihe gito.
He didn’t start out as a bad guy.	Ntabwo yatangiye ari umusore mubi.
You have very little time.	Ufite igihe gito cyane.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
He said he was going to do it.	Yavuze ko agiye kubikora.
He thought I was working all day	Yatekereje ko nkora umunsi wose
But none of that said.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo yavuze.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekereje cyane
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I want him to do what he really wants	Ndashaka ko agira ibyo ashaka rwose
One woman, is	Umugore umwe, ni
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Muri ibyo aribyo byiza.
I guess we can go down	Ndakeka ko dushobora kujya hasi
I don't think so.	Ntekereza ko atari byo.
He had no reason to be present.	Nta mpamvu yari afite yo kuba ahari.
And so are you.	Kandi nawe muri wowe.
I thought a lot	Natekereje cyane
And in fact there is.	Kandi mubyukuri hariho.
Good plan.	Gahunda nziza.
Your child can walk.	Umwana wawe arashobora kugenda.
Someone who is scared	Umuntu ufite ubwoba
I can't take anything else.	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ikindi kintu.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I thought it was great.	Natekereje ko ari byiza cyane.
Just stop doing it.	Reka gusa kubikora.
I think he was right.	Ntekereza ko yari afite ukuri.
She was very nice and nice.	Yari mwiza cyane kandi mwiza.
I need to be alone for a while.	Nkeneye kuba wenyine wenyine igihe gito.
I can't live without my phone	Sinshobora kubaho nta terefone yanjye
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You don't even have to work.	Ntugomba rwose no gukora.
I wanted to do it.	Nashakaga kubikora.
And she was not just a woman.	Kandi ntabwo yari umugore gusa.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
At the time, I knew what he was trying to do.	Icyo gihe nari nzi icyo yashakaga gukora.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He wanted faith.	Yashakaga kwizera.
I found a way	Nabonye uburyo
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, icyo gihe cyose ni kirekire.
You were before.	Wari mbere.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
He was a young man who knew very well.	Yari umusore wari uzi neza.
I would eat something	Nari kurya ikintu
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
I know for sure.	Nzi neza.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
I saw nothing and heard nothing	Ntacyo nabonye kandi ntacyo numvise
I didn’t know what, but something	Sinari nzi icyo, ariko ikintu
It was too much to take.	Byari byinshi cyane gufata.
I need to go.	Nkeneye kugenda.
I want you to do something	Ndashaka ko ukora ikintu
I want him to say a lot.	Ndashaka ko avuga byinshi.
I have children.	Mfite abana.
You can always.	Buri gihe urashobora.
I guess that's all we can do	Ndakeka ko aribyo byose dushobora gukora
That's right.	Nibyo.
They were not human.	Ntabwo bari abantu.
At that time I was not sure of anything	Icyo gihe sinari nzi neza ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
He has a gift.	Afite impano.
I never felt that I was doing anything	Sinigeze numva ko hari icyo nkora
I am very happy to go	Nishimiye cyane kugenda
I had a lot of problems	Nagize ibibazo byinshi
I heard this time	Numvise iki gihe
Stop giving up.	Reka kureka.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He is in everything.	Ari kuri byose.
I want to help your son.	Ndashaka gufasha umuhungu wawe.
I love my family.	Nkunda umuryango wanjye.
He didn't know what to expect.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo agomba gutegereza.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
I didn't want to do that	Ntabwo nashakaga kubikora
That would be true.	Byaba ari ukuri.
I appreciate your time	Nishimiye umwanya wawe
Nothing at all.	Nta kintu na kimwe rwose.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
I never felt so wanted	Sinigeze numva nshaka cyane
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
I thought maybe they would drink	Natekereje ko ahari bari kunywa
I just want to be your friend	Ndashaka kuba inshuti yawe gusa
I thought, maybe.	Natekereje, birashoboka.
I was a good guy	Nari umusore mwiza
Today, not much.	Uyu munsi, si byinshi.
I don't think you can.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ushobora.
I only saw a woman	Nabonye umugore gusa
He needed to go.	Yari akeneye kugenda.
I don't know what to say.	Ntabwo nzi icyo avuga.
And that's exactly what he wanted to do.	Kandi icyo ni cyo yashakaga gukora.
And who you are.	Ninde kandi icyo uri cyo.
I think he did all the swimming	Ntekereza ko byose byo koga yakoze
It's all the same	Byose birasa
He needed something.	Yari akeneye ikintu.
Someone needs a job	Umuntu akeneye akazi
But only us.	Ariko twe gusa.
I can't think of anything worse.	Sinshobora gutekereza ikintu kibi cyane.
I can't do it all day	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora umunsi wose
I didn't know what to believe.	Sinari nzi icyo nizera.
I heard good things about him.	Numvise ibintu byiza kuri we.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
I saw.	Nabonye.
Very simple, but very good.	Byoroshye byoroshye, ariko byiza cyane.
I wanted this.	Nashakaga ibi.
No one can do it.	Nta n'umwe ushobora gukora.
I can't wait to go home	Sinshobora gutegereza gutaha
He is confident that he will do so.	Yizeye neza ko abikora.
I think he has already dropped out of school	Ndatekereza ko yamaze kureka ishuri
He has no one.	Nta muntu afite.
I didn't know much about it	Ntabwo nari nzi byinshi kuri byo
Your hair.	Umusatsi wawe.
I want to know more.	Ndashaka kumenya neza.
They know where they are.	Bazi aho bari.
I want to know how to do it.	Ndashaka kumenya kubikora.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
I need to believe he didn't	Nkeneye kwizera ko atabikoze
To play	Gukina.
I think it's good	Ntekereza ko ari byiza
He didn't believe it.	Ntabwo yari yizeye.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
But you can't do that.	Ariko ntushobora kubikora.
That was good for me.	Ibyo byari byiza kuri njye.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
I didn't hear how he went	Ntabwo numvise uko yagiye
He is not going.	Ntabwo agenda.
He wants to know who he is.	Ashaka kumenya uwo ari we.
I mean, later.	Ndashaka kuvuga, nyuma.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Probably they were.	Birashoboka ko bari.
He had to wait.	Yari afite gutegereza.
I don't want to be here at all	Sinshaka kuba hano rwose
I can't figure out what he's talking about	Sinshobora kumenya ibyo avuga
I enjoyed this !.	Nishimiye iyi!.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
I wouldn't wait long.	Ntabwo nari gutegereza igihe kirekire.
But he did well enough.	Ariko yakoze neza bihagije.
I can't figure out what to do	Sinshobora kumenya icyo gukora
Being there.	Kuba ahari.
I wanted him to feel the need for me	Nashakaga ko yumva ko nkeneye
I think he enjoyed this	Ndatekereza ko yishimiye ibi
And you can only have one.	Kandi urashobora kugira kimwe gusa.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
I mean, you know where	Ndashaka kuvuga, uzi aho
I need to live a little	Nkeneye kubaho gato
I didn't want to talk to him	Sinifuzaga kuvugana na we
I think he would look good in me	Ndatekereza ko yari kureba neza muri njye
I have a child at home	Mfite umwana murugo
This is good advice.	Iyi ni inama nziza.
He didn't try.	Ntabwo yagerageje.
He went to it.	Yagiye kuri yo.
Take things easy.	Gufata ibintu byoroshye.
However, it is true.	Ariko, ni ukuri.
I knew what he meant.	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
We have new friends.	Dufite inshuti nshya.
I saw the same thing	Nabonye ikintu kimwe
My family, to me.	Umuryango wanjye, kuri njye.
The girl could carry a lot	Umukobwa yashoboraga gutwara byinshi
I really think so	Ndatekereza rwose ko ari
For me this is great.	Kuri njye ibi ni byiza cyane.
In any case.	Muri ibyo ari byo byose.
It seems to be good for me here.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza kuri njye hano.
But one more thing.	Ariko kimwe kimwe kandi.
If so.	Niba byari ukuri.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I never felt like talking to someone	Sinigeze numva nshaka kuvugana n'umuntu
But that’s just the problem.	Ariko ni ikibazo gusa.
You should never work.	Ntugomba na rimwe gukora.
It was just an idea	Byari igitekerezo gusa
It is not a good idea to do this.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza cyo gukora ibi.
I have a place to go	Mfite aho dushobora kujya
I would give up everything.	Nari kureka byose.
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
I can't understand this world	Ntabwo nshobora kumva iyi si
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
He enjoyed the morning.	Yishimiye icyo gitondo.
I have nothing else to do about this	Sinshobora kugira ikindi nkora kuri ibi
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
You can't hear.	Ntushobora kumva.
They have one daughter	Bafite umukobwa umwe
This is obviously the most likely scenario.	Ibi biragaragara ko aribyo bishoboka cyane.
I can't say for sure right now.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza ubu.
I mean, you can see what he looks like	Ndashaka kuvuga, urashobora kubona uko asa
I need to tell someone, just once	Nkeneye kubwira umuntu, rimwe gusa
If not now, soon.	Niba atari nonaha, vuba.
It was all a good thing.	Byose byari ibintu byiza.
It would definitely be.	Byari kuba rwose.
He can only think of a movie.	Arashobora gutekereza gusa kuri firime.
I think we have everything	Ntekereza ko ibintu byose dufite
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
We are not where we are.	Ntabwo turi aho turi.
And his father will do it.	Kandi se azabikora.
I have something else to do	Mfite ikindi kintu cyo gukora
Most of his father in him.	Byinshi muri se muri we.
You can trust a dog for anything.	Urashobora kwizera imbwa ikintu cyose.
I have a lot of people	Mfite abantu benshi
It's not working.	Ntabwo ari gukora.
However, it is possible.	Ariko, birashoboka.
I knew that	Nari nzi ko aribyo
It looks simple enough.	Birasa byoroshye bihagije.
I thought this was very easy	Natekereje ko ibi byari byoroshye cyane
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Time to look.	Igihe cyo kureba.
I have never heard anyone say that before.	Sinigeze numva umuntu avuga kubikora mbere.
He did not expect it.	Ntiyari yiteze.
To.	Kuri.
Maybe you should go too.	Birashoboka ko nawe ugomba kugenda.
I just ask the question.	Ndabaza gusa ikibazo.
He had come, but he probably would not have stayed.	Yari yaje, ariko birashoboka ko atari kuguma.
Or her hair.	Cyangwa umusatsi we.
I think this is a good idea	Ntekereza ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza
I'm afraid that's the case	Mfite ubwoba ko aribyo
Many good reasons	Impamvu nyinshi nziza
And he hasn’t done much since.	Kandi kuva icyo gihe ntabwo yakoze cyane.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
I just need to stop what he is doing	Nkeneye gusa guhagarika ibyo akora
I know nothing about this	Ntacyo nzi kuri ibi
I think it's very low.	Ntekereza ko ari hasi cyane.
He was inside.	Yari imbere.
It would be high.	Yaba hejuru.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
This is almost certainly the case.	Ibi hafi ya byose biragaragara.
No one knew why.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi impamvu.
I thought about it a lot.	Natekereje cyane kuri iyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni byiza cyane kuri ibyo.
I just heard it and I know it's there, inside	Gusa numvise kandi nzi ko ahari, imbere
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
They did not know where he was.	Ntabwo bari bazi aho ari.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
She took her child very seriously.	Yafashe umwana we cyane.
He had no job.	Nta kazi yari afite.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But he wanted to stay.	Ariko yashakaga kuguma.
I never saw him do that.	Sinigeze mbona abikora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I have a young son.	Mfite umuhungu muto.
One thing we can do.	Ikintu kimwe dushobora gukora.
He was good at this.	Yari mwiza kuri ibi.
I mean, obviously that’s what it is.	Ndashaka kuvuga, biragaragara icyo aricyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
But dear, you do nothing.	Ariko nyamuneka, ntacyo ukora.
We have problems recently.	Dufite ibibazo vuba aha.
I have to go for a while	Ngomba kugenda igihe gito
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
I didn't know it, but I felt it was good	Ntabwo nari nzi, ariko numvise ari byiza
I have nothing to do with that	Ntacyo mfite cyo gukora kuri ibyo
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza
As you did.	Nkuko wabikoze.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
He never did and never will.	Ntiyigeze agira kandi ntazigera abikora.
Who can ask for help?	Ninde ushobora gusaba ubufasha.
We had a new house.	Twari dufite inzu nshya.
But that is not a book.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari igitabo.
His car looked good.	Imodoka ye yasaga neza.
I did not do well.	Ntabwo nakoze neza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But only one day.	Ariko umunsi umwe gusa.
He said he knew the guy.	Yavuze ko yari azi umusore.
He thought about what to do.	Yatekereje ku cyo gukora.
He told me a lot about it.	Yambwiye byinshi kuri byo.
We have to have something.	Tugomba kugira ikintu.
He wanted, he wanted.	Yashakaga, yashakaga.
I can do nothing at all	Ntacyo nshobora gukora na gato
He was in dire need.	Yari akeneye cyane.
He may be bad.	Ashobora kuba mubi.
He didn't go.	Ntabwo yagiye.
I'm leaving now.	Ngiye kugenda ubu.
I had thought	Nari natekereje
I think that's what I like.	Ntekereza ko aribyo nkunda.
And it was probably true.	Kandi birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
But you have a book.	Ariko ufite igitabo.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
I don't know where he is.	Sinzi aho ari.
Everything was here.	Byose byari hano.
I had something to eat	Nari mfite ibyo kurya
There is knowledge.	Hariho kumenya.
I could not.	Sinigeze nshobora.
You can’t eat just one.	Ntushobora kurya kimwe gusa.
He has to be one guy.	Agomba kuba umusore umwe.
I really didn’t want to know more	Sinifuzaga rwose kumenya byinshi
To see	Kubona.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
I did not	Ntabwo nakoze
Another problem.	Ikindi kibazo.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
I think one child	Ntekereza ko umwana umwe
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
I really can't.	Sinshobora rwose.
Drinking someone.	Kunywa umuntu.
But now I can't even do it.	Ariko ubu sinshobora gusa no kubikora.
I want to eat at home	Ndashaka kurya murugo
I just felt the need to come	Gusa numvise nkeneye kuza
I need to talk to you as soon as possible.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe vuba bishoboka.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
This was his place.	Uyu wari umwanya we.
It will not be.	Ntabwo bizaba.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
Inside is inside, outside.	Muri ni muri, hanze.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
I didn’t want him to have problems.	Sinifuzaga ko agira ibibazo.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded	Yari azi ko ibyo bishoboka
A lot of money together	Amafaranga menshi hamwe
I can't let this happen	Sinshobora kureka ibi
You don't have to do it alone.	Ntugomba kubikora wenyine.
But you don’t have to.	Ariko ntugomba.
It will be.	Bizaba.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I had an idea for this.	Nari mfite igitekerezo kuri ibi.
I hope this is possible	Ndizera ko ibi bishoboka
He said he did not.	Yavuze ko atabikoze.
There was so much to live for.	Byari byinshi byo kubaho.
I never thought that	Sinigeze ntekereza ko
You were right.	Wari ufite ukuri.
You are not good, you are bad.	Ntabwo uri mwiza, uri mubi.
Really bad.	Mubyukuri mubi.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
I can't stay here.	Sinshobora kuguma hano.
It was all about him.	Byose byari byinshi kuri we.
I really have to go now	Ngomba rwose kugenda ubu
He did not know where or how to do it.	Ntiyari azi aho cyangwa kubikora.
Below.	Munsi.
Or maybe his beautiful wife.	Cyangwa ahari umugore we mwiza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He could see his wife well.	Yashoboraga kubona umugore we neza.
It looks bad.	Birasa nabi.
He did that.	Ibyo yabikoze.
I have to tell everyone.	Ngomba kubwira abantu bose.
I saw.	Nabonye.
I knew it was wrong.	Nari nzi ko atari byo.
I think you're good to him	Ntekereza ko uri mwiza kuri we
I have made many good friends outside.	Nabonye inshuti nyinshi nziza hanze.
He thought back.	Yatekereje inyuma.
That's right.	Nibyo.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
My friend is gone.	Inshuti yanjye yagiye.
You too.	Nawe.
That was a really good thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza rwose.
It will be.	Bizaba.
He was a good player.	Yari umukinnyi mwiza.
For me this is good.	Kuri njye ibi ni byiza.
As before.	Nka mbere.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I want to tell my wife.	Ndashaka kubwira umugore wanjye.
He wants to be friends.	Ashaka kuba inshuti.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
In fact, that's not all.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You were alone.	Wari wenyine.
I didn’t really think it was his fault	Ntabwo rwose natekerezaga ko ari amakosa ye
That's right, this is it.	Nibyiza, nuko, nuko.
He was very young.	Yari akiri muto cyane.
I know how you like to read.	Nzi uburyo ukunda gusoma.
I really need to go	Nkeneye cyane kugenda
I really need money	Nkeneye amafaranga rwose
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
I didn't know anyone	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nzi
He has to do something.	Agomba kugira icyo akora.
I like it here.	Nkunda hano.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I thought we had years to go	Natekerezaga ko dufite imyaka yo kujyana
It's a great gift.	Ni impano nziza.
But he.	Ariko we.
I have a lot to say.	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
We are friends now.	Turi inshuti ubu.
It was not what he expected.	Ntiyari aho yari yiteze.
I had a problem with this	Nagize ikibazo kuri ibi
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
Well, at least we didn't go down without explaining ourselves first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko tugomba.
They were finally here.	Amaherezo bari hano.
I was sure it wasn't one of them	Nari nzi neza ko atari kimwe muri byo
And in it.	Kandi muri yo.
In fact, he has to stop talking.	Mubyukuri, agomba guhagarika kuvuga.
I shouldn't stay	Ntabwo nkwiye kuguma
He left quickly.	Yagiye vuba.
There was a girl here, and she looked like you.	Hano hari umukobwa, kandi yasaga nawe.
Eventually, he could not see anyone or anything.	Amaherezo, ntabwo yashoboraga kubona umuntu cyangwa ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I hope it is the same for everyone	Nizera ko ari kimwe kuri buri wese
However, this is not a problem.	Ariko, iki ntabwo ari ikibazo.
He has a lot of problems.	Afite ibibazo byinshi.
I was not alone	Ntabwo nari mfite wenyine
All of this I heard from my friend	Ibyo byose numvise inshuti yanjye
I would do the same	Nanjye nari kubikora
And to do so you have good hair.	Kandi kubikora ufite umusatsi mwiza.
I would swim for a long time.	Nari koga igihe kirekire.
This was a dress.	Iyi yari imyenda.
And it was good for me.	Kandi yari mwiza kuri njye.
That's really good for me.	Nibyiza rwose kuri njye.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
I knew exactly what he was saying	Nari nzi neza ibyo avuga
He is sitting there.	Yicaye aho.
I had to go tonight	Nari ngomba kugenda muri iri joro
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I just need to do it in this room	Nkeneye gusa kubikora muri iki cyumba
And it will be.	Kandi bizaba.
But someone is going to do it.	Ariko umuntu agiye kubikora.
I did the same thing for myself today	Nagize ikintu kimwe kuri njye uyu munsi
I knew you had it in you	Nari nzi ko ufite muri wowe
From the room.	Kuva mu cyumba.
You think this is good.	Utekereza ko ibi ari byiza.
I only want one.	Ndashaka umwe gusa.
I had everything for me	Nari mfite byose kuri njye
Very good thing	Ikintu cyiza cyane
He is doing well on his own.	Arimo akora neza wenyine wenyine.
I can't stay there	Sinshobora kuguma aho
I have to do it right.	Ngomba kubikora neza.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ni byiza rwose.
I knew it was you	Nari nzi ko ari wowe
I needed a question	Nari nkeneye ikibazo
Money is real.	Amafaranga ni ukuri.
No one knew he was going.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi ko agiye.
I didn't see much	Ntacyo nabonye neza
He did not want them to do so.	Ntiyashakaga ko abikora.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
This was it.	Uyu yari uyu.
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
I need time.	Nkeneye igihe.
We are always there.	Buri gihe turi.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
He went.	Yagiye.
It's the same with me.	Ni kimwe kuri njye.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo gukora.
Maybe it will be soon.	Ahari bizaba vuba.
I just enjoyed the good movie	Gusa nishimiye firime nziza
There are a lot of issues here.	Hano hari ibibazo byinshi.
He didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo yatekerezaga neza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Sometimes you don't want anything.	Hari igihe udashaka ikintu na kimwe.
I hope you did too.	Ndizera ko nawe wabikoze.
There are many children.	Hariho abana benshi.
I didn't know that was possible	Sinari nzi uko ibyo bishoboka
Living is not good.	Kubaho ntabwo ari byiza.
We have to do it again.	Tugomba kongera kubikora.
You know a lot.	Ibyo uzi byinshi.
All is well.	Byose nibyiza.
I want to help	Ndashaka gufasha
I have nothing to eat	Ntacyo mfite cyo kurya
And when he did, it was great.	Kandi iyo yabikoze byari byiza cyane.
Very nice thing, good gift.	Ikintu cyiza cyane, impano nziza.
This is the only time right now.	Uyu ni umwanya gusa kuri ubu.
From then on we can go very far, really.	Kuva icyo gihe dushobora kujya kure cyane, rwose.
I wanted to know more about him	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi kuri we
I only have one	Mfite umwe gusa
All together he is.	Bose hamwe ni we.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, byari amakosa.
I don't know how he does it.	Sinzi uko abikora.
I know that’s not all, though	Nzi ko atari byose, ariko
I really wanted to see everyone	Nashakaga rwose kubona abantu bose
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
I mean this time.	Ndashaka kuvuga iki gihe.
And more.	Kandi ikindi.
I should look into that.	Nkwiye kureba muri ibyo.
Is that right	Nibyo?
I knew he was a boy.	Nari nzi ko ari umuhungu.
I finally got a job	Amaherezo nabonye akazi
He had to figure out what to do now.	Yagombaga kumenya icyo gukora ubu.
I thought he couldn't talk at the time.	Natekerezaga ko adashobora kuvuga icyo gihe.
There is a reason for faith.	Hariho impamvu yo kwizera.
That's right.	Nibyo cyane.
Until that day.	Kugeza uwo munsi.
I need to talk to him.	Nkeneye kuvugana na we.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
And he is right.	Kandi afite ukuri.
He chose to.	Yahisemo ko agomba.
I was really scared.	Nagize ubwoba mubyukuri.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
I can't live with you	Sinshobora kubana nawe
There is so much to do now.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora ubu.
I can go now	Nshobora kugenda ubu
He asked what he had said.	Yabajije icyo yavuze.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
But that is exactly what happened.	Ariko ibyo nibyo rwose.
I like my short hair	Nkunda umusatsi wanjye muto
Life chances.	Amahirwe yo kubaho.
I feel like looking up is good	Ndumva kureba hejuru nibyiza
I got a job without a problem	Nabonye akazi nta kibazo
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko aribyo.
It’s not really a good thing.	Ntabwo rwose ari ibintu byiza.
You can't really tell, it's the same with me.	Ntushobora kumenya mubyukuri, birasa kuri njye.
I just want to make it work	Gusa ndashaka kubikora neza
I can't let this happen	Sinshobora kureka ibi
Sometimes, this is exactly what he needs.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibi nibyo akeneye mubyukuri.
The teacher said nothing.	Umwarimu ntacyo yavuze.
What he was thinking now.	Ibyo yatekerezaga ubu.
Nothing always.	Nta kintu na kimwe buri gihe.
I know it's hard	Nzi ko bigoye
You have to.	Ugomba nawe.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I hope he did.	Ndizera ko yabikoze.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I never liked just one woman	Ntabwo nigeze nkunda umugore umwe gusa
We just have to see.	Tugomba gusa kubona.
Every day is the same.	Buri munsi birasa.
That's my favorite.	Nibyiza nkunda.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
I needed to do it on my own	Nari nkeneye kubikora wenyine
And that's not really the case.	Kandi ibyo sibyo rwose.
You can't wait to see your wife.	Ntushobora gutegereza kubona umugore wawe.
I need to know, sometimes	Nkeneye kumenya, rimwe na rimwe
There is a lot going on today.	Muri iki gihe hari byinshi.
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda
And your new phone.	Na terefone yawe nshya.
I can't feel the clothes	Sinshobora kumva ko hari imyenda
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
It is in us.	Ni muri twe.
I did not hear	Ntabwo numvise
Especially to do it together.	Cyane cyane kubikora hamwe.
I had a bad day	Nagize umunsi mubi
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
You don't have to look.	Ntugomba kureba.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
I didn't have one	Ntabwo nari mfite
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
To try	Kugerageza.
I can be far, far away	Nshobora kuba kure, kure
He was behind her.	Yari inyuma ye.
I enjoyed all that.	Nishimiye ibyo byose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, byari byiza kugerageza.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo byose.
Only this time he was scared, really scared.	Gusa iki gihe yagize ubwoba, rwose afite ubwoba.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
You have to take a lot.	Ugomba gufata byinshi.
I love everything you do	Nkunda ibyo ukora byose
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
I didn't think it would be difficult	Sinatekerezaga ko byari kuba bigoye
You can say whatever you want.	Urashobora kuvuga icyo ushaka cyose.
He had accepted his position.	Yari yemeye umwanya we.
Maybe you can live longer for him.	Ahari ushobora kubaho igihe kirekire kuri we.
I didn’t want to look at everything	Sinifuzaga kureba byose
All or nothing here.	Byose cyangwa ntacyo hano.
I didn't know what it was.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo.
I didn’t want you to have to live like that.	Sinifuzaga ko ugomba kubaho gutya.
I want my daughter to have that room	Ndashaka ko umukobwa wanjye agira icyo cyumba
There is no reason to do that.	Nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
You don’t know exactly why or how.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu cyangwa uburyo.
I need another time.	Nkeneye ikindi gihe.
I have it here in front of me	Mfite hano imbere yanjye
But there is one problem for him.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kimwe kuri we.
I'm glad to be with you	Nishimiye kujyana nawe
You are so talented.	Ufite impano cyane.
It was a worry.	Byari impungenge.
You know a lot, it looks like.	Uzi byinshi, birasa.
I want to go do everything with you	Ndashaka kujya gukora byose hamwe nawe
Now he is gone.	Ubu yagiye.
I made a lot of mistakes	Nakoze amakosa menshi
And the boy wanted to be nice.	Kandi umuhungu yashakaga kuba mwiza.
I can't buy anything right now	Ntacyo nshobora kugura ubu
That's right.	Nibyo.
I was not at the meeting	Ntabwo nari muri iyo nama
I wanted to read something else	Nashakaga gusoma ikindi kintu
You should have come here earlier.	Wari ukwiye kuza hano mbere.
I think you know what to do	Ntekereza ko uzi icyo gukora
It's not easy for me.	Ntabwo byoroshye kuba njye.
Things are true.	Ibintu ni ukuri.
I don't know who that person is.	Sinzi uwo muntu uwo ari we.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I just saw that outside.	Gusa nanjye nabonye ibyo hanze.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
I can't live with one person	Sinshobora kubana numuntu umwe
I thought about it a lot.	Natekereje kuri byinshi.
I knew what he was up to	Nari nzi ibyo arimo
I'm sorry to hear that	Mbabajwe no kuba imbere cyane
I trust the player	Nizera umukinnyi
I want to go home	Ndashaka gutaha
I think he is right	Ntekereza ko avuga ukuri
I got my chance	Nabonye amahirwe yanjye
He went down.	Yagiye hasi.
We have to go. 	Tugomba kugenda.
'	'
I can't wait to read it again	Sinshobora gutegereza kongera gusoma
He doesn’t want anything or what he needs.	Ntashaka ikintu cyangwa icyo akeneye.
I know this is true for me.	Nzi ko ibi ari ukuri kuri njye.
This was not a house.	Iyi ntiyari inzu.
That's what he says.	Ibyo avuga nibyo.
He was at work.	Yari ahari ku kazi.
No one was found this morning.	Muri iki gitondo, nta muntu n'umwe yabonye.
I think they were behind me	Ntekereza ko bari inyuma yanjye
I want to drink something else	Ndashaka kunywa ikindi
He loved that thing.	Yakundaga icyo kintu.
I mean, just about everyone, everyone.	Ndashaka kuvuga, gusa buri, abantu bose.
We are not one.	Ntabwo turi umwe.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
Good vision.	Kubona neza.
I want to help.	Ndashaka gufasha.
Absolutely scary.	Rwose ubwoba.
And it was good and early.	Kandi byari byiza kandi kare.
He has a phone outside.	Afite terefone hanze.
I want to play.	Ndashaka gukina.
But that is all.	Ariko ibyo aribyo byose.
I thought this was easy	Natekereje ko ibi byoroshye
But no one was in the room.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wari mu cyumba.
What did you say	Wavuze iki.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva ahari
I was so happy all that time	Nishimiye cyane icyo gihe cyose
So far, that has worked.	Kugeza ubu, ibyo byagenze neza.
I did a lot.	Nakoze cyane.
Another problem, and it's really good.	Ikindi kibazo, kandi ni cyiza rwose.
I heard nothing	Nta kintu numvise
And that’s probably the good thing.	Kandi birashoboka ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
There is a time for everyone.	Hariho umwanya wa buri wese.
But you too.	Ariko nawe.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
But he can't do that.	Ariko ntashobora gukora ibyo.
I never thought much of him	Sinigeze ntekereza cyane kuri we
I never liked it	Ntabwo nigeze nkunda
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
I was looking for a dog	Nashakaga imbwa
Behind.	Inyuma.
I can't live with you	Sinshobora kubana nawe
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
I know you're scared	Nzi ko ufite ubwoba
I really hope you can do that	Ndizera rwose ko ushobora kubikora
I think that's the job	Ntekereza ko aribyo gukora akazi
But you are not alone.	Ariko ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
Maybe you have.	Birashoboka ko ufite.
Normally it was normal.	Mu bisanzwe byari bisanzwe.
I think it’s probably the best	Ntekereza ko bishoboka ari byiza cyane
He was very good at that.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri ibyo.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I just need time.	Nkeneye gusa umwanya.
I actually saw this movie before.	Nukuri nabonye iyi firime mbere.
I think he needs a friend.	Ntekereza ko akeneye inshuti.
I know we can win first	Nzi ko dushobora gutsinda mbere
Gito.	Gito.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
But he had to try anything.	Ariko yagombaga kugerageza ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
It is not very easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
He must have.	Agomba kugira.
I never liked it very much	Ntabwo nigeze nkunda cyane
'	'
I need the opportunity to do so	Nkeneye amahirwe yo kubikora
I like being around you	Nkunda kuba hafi yawe
I knew in that look that he had succeeded	Nari nzi ko bishoboka ko ntacyo aricyo
It was too high.	Byari hejuru cyane.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
I found a nice house for her.	Nabonye inzu nziza kuri we.
And act like you.	Kandi gukora nkaho nawe.
We have a plan.	Dufite gahunda.
I don't like it here for a long time	Ntabwo nkunda hano igihe kirekire
I was so excited to come	Nari nishimiye cyane kuza
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
I knew exactly what he meant	Nari nzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga
Like this.	Nka iyi.
I really need to talk to you.	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana nawe.
I know you have to do it	Nzi ko ugomba kubikora
But in the end, here it is.	Ariko amaherezo, hano.
I was very young at the time	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane
You can't do this.	Ntushobora gukora ibi.
I don't need anything	Ntacyo nkeneye
I didn't get much time to look	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kureba cyane
You can't do that to me.	Ntushobora gukora 'kuri njye.
I need to know if that is the case	Nkeneye kumenya niba aribyo
I could never take this	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora gufata ibi
I think you need something	Ntekereza ko hari icyo ukeneye
Absolutely not.	Rwose ntabwo aribyo.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
The first thing we need is money.	Ikintu cya mbere dukeneye ni amafaranga.
I am afraid to tell my family.	Mfite ubwoba bwo kubwira umuryango wanjye.
Yes, he did.	Nibyo, na we yari afite.
But it is not very difficult.	Ariko ntabwo bigoye cyane.
It's a great plan.	Ni gahunda nziza cyane.
I just know what he thinks	Gusa nzi icyo atekereza
Everyone has one.	Umuntu wese afite umwe.
And they weren’t easy kids.	Kandi ntabwo bari abana byoroshye.
You were one of the many.	Wari umwe muri benshi.
I think it's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
I think they all know the truth	Ntekereza ko bose bazi ukuri
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
I have nothing	Ntacyo mfite
And he's in the movie.	Kandi ari muri firime.
People are here.	Abantu bari hano.
Where?	Aho?
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki.
He should have stayed away.	Yari akwiye kuguma kure.
It's easy.	Byoroshye.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
I really wanted something to believe	Nashakaga rwose ikintu cyo kwizera
He thought quickly.	Yatekerezaga vuba.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
That one was so bad.	Uwo yari mubi cyane.
I didn't want to go down	Sinifuzaga kujya hasi
I'm going to try to do the same	Ngiye kugerageza gukora kimwe
He didn't look very good outside.	Ntabwo yarebye neza cyane hanze.
You are not young.	Ntabwo uri muto.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I wonder where he went	Ndabaza aho yagiye
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I didn't want to go	Sinifuzaga kugenda
She is a bad woman.	Ni umugore mubi.
I didn’t need to add to that	Sinari nkeneye kongera kuri ibyo
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
I knew in that look that it had happened	Nari nzi uko ibyo byagenze
My plan.	Gahunda yanjye.
I don't think so	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo
He said he was.	Yavuze ko ari.
I enjoyed your time this morning.	Nishimiye umwanya wawe muri iki gitondo.
And alone.	Kandi wenyine.
Just tell me what you need.	Gusa mbwira icyo ukeneye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari njye rwose.
It’s good to be back here and play again.	Nibyiza gusubira hano no kongera gukina.
I think that's good	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza
You have nothing.	Nta na kimwe ufite.
If that's the case with you, that's fine.	Niba aribyo ufite, nibyiza.
Very nice girl	Umukobwa mwiza cyane
But what would he do? 	Ariko yari gukora iki?
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I'm glad you did it here	Nishimiye ko wabikoze hano
Eating good food.	Kurya ibiryo byiza.
We had work to do.	Twari dufite akazi ko gukora.
You are a good person.	Uri umuntu mwiza.
He didn't do it right.	Ntabwo yabikoze neza.
I know a lot about him	Nzi byinshi kuri we
I wasn't sure if that was the case	Sinari nzi neza kimwe muri ibyo
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi uko ni ko byagenze.
Probably not much.	Birashoboka ko atari byinshi.
I wanted both	Nashakaga bombi
I thought about it every day	Natekerezaga buri munsi
They were under me.	Bari munsi yanjye.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
I want to do things	Ndashaka gukora ibintu
You want money.	Urashaka amafaranga.
I can't work.	Sinshobora gukora.
I didn’t think he would do it	Sinatekerezaga ko azabikora
He would not go.	Ntabwo yari kugenda.
It was good for that.	Byari byiza kuri ibyo.
We have to do everything.	Tugomba gukora byose.
I hope you have.	Ndizera ko ufite.
Everyone did as they pleased.	Umuntu wese yakoze uko ashaka.
You have a lot to do.	Ufite byinshi byo gukora.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
Great idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
I didn’t know if that was possible	Sinari nzi niba ibyo bishoboka
This one is really good.	Iyi rwose ni nziza.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
It wasn’t just good.	Ntabwo byari byiza gusa.
I just wanted to, I wanted any woman, bad	Nashakaga gusa, nashakaga umugore uwo ari we wese, mubi
I think they would be here	Ndatekereza ko bari kuba hano
I was looking for money.	Nashakaga amafaranga.
I knew he would be early	Nari nzi ko azaba kare
I had a lot of problems	Nari mfite ibibazo byinshi
Today was not the day to do so.	Uyu munsi ntabwo wari umunsi wo kubikora.
They are all under him	Bose bari munsi ye
And he is not here.	Kandi ntabwo ari hano.
He was on the phone.	Yari terefone.
I need to get on top of reading	Nkeneye kubona hejuru yo gusoma
I wanted to hear everything he said	Nashakaga kumva ibyo avuga byose
I am here in front of you	Ndi hano imbere yawe
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
It is not a plan to strike.	Ntabwo ari gahunda yo guhagarika akazi.
It was much harder than that.	Byari bigoye cyane kurenza ibyo.
It was good, it was really good.	Byari byiza, nibyiza rwose.
I didn’t want to let anyone down	Sinifuzaga kureka umuntu uwo ari we wese
I needed something	Nari nkeneye ikintu
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
Come to him.	Kuza kuri we.
So far, so good, one can think.	Kugeza ubu, byiza cyane, umuntu ashobora gutekereza.
I hope you find something above	Ndizera ko ushobora kubona ikintu hejuru
He always seems to know everyone.	Buri gihe asa nkaho azi abantu bose.
I know exactly where it is.	Nzi neza aho ari.
Only.	Gusa.
I hope they are close by	Nizere ko bari hafi aha
If there is a time.	Niba hari igihe.
I'm not sure about that	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo
You need the right time.	Ukeneye umwanya ukwiye.
I don't believe you know all this time	Ntabwo nizera ko uzi iki gihe cyose
He wants to be around me all the time.	Arashaka kuba hafi yanjye igihe cyose.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
I don’t have to look behind me.	Ntabwo ngomba kureba inyuma yanjye.
She is very well dressed.	Yambaye neza cyane.
But he is my favorite.	Ariko niwe nkunda cyane.
I can't play	Sinshobora gukina
Nothing was wrong.	Ntacyo byari cyo.
The job was looking good	Akazi yashakaga neza
Not good for testing.	Ntabwo ari byiza mugihe cyo kugerageza.
You can be human.	Urashobora kuba umuntu.
But there.	Ariko aho.
I want to be a better person	Ndashaka kuba umuntu mwiza
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I can't think of anything right now	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza muri iki gihe
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
Easier to say than to do.	Byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
I always thought that was the case	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko aribyo
The inside was inside.	Imbere yari imbere.
But he wanted to.	Ariko yashakaga.
I didn't know it was possible	Sinari nzi ko bishoboka
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
I have to stop this issue	Ngomba guhagarika iki kibazo
But not me.	Ariko si njye.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
He says he's gone.	Avuga ko yagiye.
As usual, it is possible.	Nkuko byari bisanzwe, birashoboka.
I have enough for now	Mfite ibintu bihagije kuri ubu
I can't say for sure	Ntabwo nshobora kuvuga neza
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I feel like you got a job.	Ndumva wabonye akazi.
I need to see everything	Nkeneye ko mbona ibintu byose
We were a lot of people.	Twari abantu benshi.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
He never looked like me.	Ntiyigeze asa nkanjye.
He was his first child.	Yari umwana we wa mbere.
I think about everything.	Ntekereza kuri byose.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
I meant that at the time	Nashakaga kuvuga ko icyo gihe
But that was not enough.	Ariko ntabwo byari bihagije.
The girl was right.	Umukobwa yari afite ukuri.
I can't do that either.	Ibi na byo ntashobora kubikora.
But it was all me.	Ariko byose byari njye.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
You can go home.	Urashobora gusubira murugo.
I think he came ready	Ndakeka ko yaje yiteguye
They were so many.	Bari benshi cyane.
That's right- this is not about you.	Nibyo, mubyukuri ntabwo wari wowe.
I need to talk to you very, very badly	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe cyane, nabi cyane
And he would not have.	Kandi ntiyari kugira.
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki?.
There was not much he could do here.	Nta byinshi yashoboraga gukora hano.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He would not be the one to do this.	Ntabwo yari kuba uwo gukora ibi.
No one heard.	Nta muntu n'umwe yumvise.
He did not know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo yari gukora.
I needed clothes.	Nari nkeneye imyenda.
I think now is the best time	Ntekereza ko ubu ari igihe cyiza
It is not the same time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kimwe.
I need to know what he feels today.	Nkeneye kumenya icyo yumva muri iki gihe.
He could not have been more than thirty years old.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kurenza imyaka mirongo itatu.
I didn't know you were here	Sinari nzi ko uri hano
I'd like to have a drink	Ndashaka kubona icyo kunywa
He has to be here.	Agomba kuba hano.
I don't have to.	Ntabwo ngomba.
I think he would have done it for a while	Ndakeka ko yari kubikora igihe gito
He thought he could do it.	Yatekereje ko ashobora kubikora.
We have to win today.	Tugomba gutsinda uyu munsi.
I can't do it alone	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora wenyine
All in all or out.	Byose muri byose cyangwa hanze.
I feel scared.	Numva mfite ubwoba.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari kubikora.
I thought it would be nice to hear the moment.	Natekereje ko ari byiza ko yumva umwanya urimo.
Everything is possible here.	Byose birashoboka hano.
Now I know that is true	Ubu nzi ko aribyo
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
I thought so too.	Nanjye nari natekereje.
I was about to quit	Nari ngiye kureka
If it were easy, everyone would do it.	Niba byari byoroshye, abantu bose bari kubikora.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.	Hariho ikintu kibi rwose kuri iki kintu cyose.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I heard that it went well	Numvise ko byagenze neza
I hope so.	Nizera ko atari byo.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
We were all three years old.	Twese twari imyaka itatu.
It's not hard to do.	Ntabwo bigoye gukora.
I do very well at home	Nkora neza cyane murugo
I like to think about every good thing.	Nkunda gutekereza kuri buri kintu cyiza.
Very out here.	Hanze cyane hano.
But there are problems.	Ariko hariho ibibazo.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He was not.	Ntiyari.
But only one problem.	Ariko ikibazo kimwe gusa.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I want to know where they are	Ndashaka kumenya aho bari
I only know one thing	Nzi ikintu kimwe gusa
But he would not have seen that, not for a while.	Ariko ntabwo yari kubona ibyo, atari igihe gito.
You are so beautiful.	Biragaragara ko uri mwiza cyane.
I did it once, but not so much.	Nigeze kubikora rimwe, ariko sibyo cyane.
But, that was it.	Ariko, byari byo.
I thought things were really tough	Natekerezaga ko ibintu byari bigoye rwose
That we need help.	Ko dukeneye ubufasha.
And he really wasn't.	Kandi rwose ntabwo yari.
Obviously.	Biragaragara rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It was his fault.	Byari amakosa ye.
He is alone.	Ni wenyine.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
He wanted to do it right	Yashakaga kubikora neza
What he could think of.	Ibyo yashoboraga gutekereza.
I would read a book if there was a book	Nari gusoma igitabo niba hari igitabo
I am very happy to buy.	Nishimiye cyane kugura.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo sibyo rwose.
I didn't know it was her daughter	Sinari nzi ko ari umukobwa we
They know you have.	Bazi ko ufite.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
I was a very young man.	Nari umusore cyane.
He says it's this or that.	Avuga ko ari iyi cyangwa iyi.
I think that's a lot of concern	Ndakeka ko ibyo ari impungenge nyinshi
I can't do it tonight	Ntabwo nshobora gukora iri joro
It started at a young age.	Yatangiye akiri muto.
However, it is not easy.	Ariko, ntabwo byoroshye.
I just wanted to say.	Nashakaga kuvuga gusa.
One has to go.	Umuntu agomba kugenda.
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I think he was good	Ndakeka ko yari mwiza
I was not good to him	Ntabwo nari mwiza kuri we
It was difficult to try this.	Kugerageza iyi byari bigoye.
Or maybe it’s just intelligence.	Cyangwa birashoboka gusa ubwenge.
Good man	Umuntu mwiza.
I didn't think so	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo
I was well aware of this	Nari nzi neza ibi
It’s a matter of planning.	Ni ikibazo cya gahunda.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
Who knows if that will be possible.	Ninde uzi niba ibyo bishoboka.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
A lot of questions, maybe.	Ibibazo byinshi, birashoboka.
I thought it was not very good	Natekereje ko atari byiza cyane
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
Working day	Umunsi wo gukora.
He knew the woman was gone.	Yari azi ko umugore yagiye.
I like to think it is	Nkunda gutekereza ko ari
You can carry that for now	Urashobora gutwara ibyo kugeza ubu
Here.	Hano.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
That's really true.	Nibyo rwose nukuri.
I had no idea	Ntacyo natekereje
He didn't really mean it at the moment.	Ntabwo rwose yashakaga kuvuga kuri ubu.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
I can't wait to eat something else	Sinshobora gutegereza kurya ikindi kintu
I never felt better	Sinigeze numva neza
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
I have to do a lot.	Ngomba gukora byinshi.
There is more to this.	Hariho byinshi kuri ibi.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
To this day I knew nothing	Ntacyo nari nzi kugeza uyu munsi
No one did anything	Nta n'umwe wigeze agira icyo akora
He was a young man.	Yari umusore.
I have a problem here	Mfite ikibazo hano
I don't know what he thinks	Ntabwo nzi icyo atekereza
But he can.	Ariko arashobora.
I didn't have to go.	Sinari nkwiye kugenda.
I told no one	Nta muntu nabwiye
It was really good to do.	Byari byiza rwose gukora.
I mean, just family	Ndashaka kuvuga, umuryango gusa
You are about to make a mistake.	Ugiye gufata amakosa.
If you can see that, you can be alone.	Niba ushobora kubona ibyo, ushobora kuba umuntu wenyine.
That's right.	Hamwe nibyo.
I am always very close	Buri gihe ndi hafi cyane
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora kuri ibyo.
Everyone is clear about what they think and feel.	Umuntu wese avuga neza icyo atekereza kandi yumva.
And that's not the case.	Kandi ntabwo aribyo.
As before.	Nka mbere.
I can do anything.	Nshobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
It was great inside.	Byari byiza cyane imbere.
No ground.	Nta hasi.
We are worried.	Dufite impungenge.
I never heard of eating	Sinigeze numva kurya
Here they are !.	Hano bari!.
I think of him every day	Ntekereza kuri we buri munsi
In the family.	Muri umuryango.
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
I was very close	Nari hafi cyane
Since then there has been no looking back.	Kuva icyo gihe nta kureba inyuma.
But there is more.	Ariko hariho byinshi.
I really hope that one day we can all be friends	Nizere rwose ko umunsi umwe twese dushobora kuba inshuti
The thing is.	Ikintu ni.
You don't have to think again.	Ntugomba kongera gutekereza.
I should have	Nkwiye kugira
He is here.	Ari hano.
I didn’t want to think too much about that	Sinifuzaga gutekereza cyane kuri ibyo
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I thought he was right	Nagize ngo yari afite ukuri
I hope you look good, as usual	Ndizera ko usa neza, nkuko bisanzwe
It was hard to think clearly.	Byari bigoye gutekereza neza.
Here are some of the ones I found to be interesting:	Hano ni ibintu bisanzwe bisanzwe kuri njye.
I didn't know what to say	Sinari nzi icyo ugiye kuvuga
Something to do, eventually.	Ikintu cyo gukora, amaherezo.
Buses are great here.	Bisi ni nziza hano.
We have nothing now.	Ntacyo dufite ubu.
He never did anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora.
My daughter.	Umukobwa wanjye.
Probably not much.	Birashoboka ko atari byinshi.
Very good, really.	Byiza cyane, mubyukuri.
I know this person.	Nzi uyu muntu.
But this one was close.	Ariko uyu yari hafi.
I also feel lucky	Nanjye ndumva mfite amahirwe
But he was.	Ariko yari.
I had nothing	Ntacyo nari mfite
And that is not always easy.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye.
For me, that was a gift.	Kuri njye, iyo yari impano.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
.	.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
I feel really easy, really	Ndumva rwose byoroshye, mubyukuri
I did something wrong	Nakoze ikintu kibi
After work	Nyuma yo gukora
And his father before him.	Na se imbere ye.
I do not have.	Ntabwo mfite.
You saw.	Wabonye.
I'm out of work tomorrow.	Ndi hanze ku kazi ejo.
This is not the case today.	Ntabwo ari ukuri muri iki gihe.
I need to know why	Ngomba kumenya impamvu
You don't know everything.	Ntabwo uzi byose.
He is not young, nor is he.	Ntabwo ari muto, cyangwa, uwo.
It is not very easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
I know he plans	Nzi ko ateganya
I love it, really, and really	Nkunda cyane, mubyukuri, kandi rwose
I really hope it's not you.	Ndizera rwose ko atari wowe.
I know what he's doing	Nzi icyo arimo gukora
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
it was really good	byari byiza rwose.
Why! 	Impamvu!
'he said.	' yavuze.
I didn’t think he would do it.	Sinatekerezaga ko azabikora.
It was great to have.	Byari byiza kugira.
I really hope so	Ndizera rwose ko aribyo
I have to leave the house now	Ngomba kuva mu nzu ubu
That's what everyone knew.	Ibyo ni byo umuntu wese yari azi.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
I know something bad is wrong	Nzi ko ikintu kibi ari kibi
I can walk.	Nshobora kugenda.
I did just that.	Nakoze kimwe gusa.
Obviously that is it.	Biragaragara ko aribyo.
This is not all.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo byose.
There was a lot he wanted to say.	Hariho byinshi yashakaga kuvuga.
I understand why my daughter likes to have children	Ndumva impamvu umukobwa wanjye akunda kubana
I don't always hear that.	Ntabwo buri gihe numva.
He had a job to do.	Yari afite akazi ko gukora.
I need a drink.	Nkeneye kunywa.
I never thought much of this	Sinigeze ntekereza cyane kuri ibi
I never felt like eating.	Sinigeze numva nshaka kurya.
I want the truth.	Ndashaka ukuri.
I think it will be good	Ntekereza ko bizaba byiza
I was, just young.	Nari njye, muto gusa.
My daughter too.	Nanjye umukobwa wanjye.
I knew what he was thinking	Nari nzi icyo atekereza
He's doing the same thing now.	Akora nka mbere ubu.
But he did nothing.	Ariko nta cyo yakoze.
I have someone working right now	Mfite umuntu ukora kuri ubu
I was behind me on the floor	Nari inyuma yanjye hasi
He did not want to do that.	Ntiyashakaga kubikora.
Not bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi mubi.
He probably had an idea.	Birashoboka ko yari afite igitekerezo.
Knowing, you have to live with him.	Kumenya, ugomba kubana na we.
I mean, it's really good	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri nibyiza
I think he really did go.	Ntekereza ko yagiye rwose.
All in front of me.	Byose imbere yanjye.
That's right.	Niki koko.
She seemed embarrassed and scared.	Yasaga naho agira isoni kandi afite ubwoba.
It's a good thing.	Ni ibintu byiza.
I may be here for three years.	Nshobora kuba hano imyaka itatu.
He knew he was there.	Yari azi ko yari ahari.
I have no job.	Nta kazi mfite.
All you do is call.	Ibyo ukora byose ni terefone.
He said he did not.	Yavuze ko atabikoze.
I know what he needs	Nzi icyo akeneye
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I was just a friend	Nari inshuti gusa
I never wanted one of those	Sinigeze nshaka na kimwe muri ibyo
I need this thing soon	Nkeneye iki kintu vuba
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
I love money.	Nkunda amafaranga.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu.
I think that's what you do.	Ntekereza ko aricyo ukora.
I like to study.	Nkunda kwiga.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
Very good so far.	Nibyiza cyane kugeza ubu.
I didn't see any plans or mistakes to make	Ntabwo nabonye gahunda cyangwa amakosa yo gukora
Best friend	Inshuti nziza cyane.
But nothing.	Ariko nta kintu.
He wanted so much.	Yashakaga byinshi cyane.
And that was definitely enough.	Kandi ibyo byari bihagije rwose.
I didn’t want to do it in public.	Sinifuzaga kubikora imbere ya bose.
And he had.	Kandi yari afite.
He is probably scared.	Birashoboka ko afite ubwoba.
Not you.	Ko wowe.
I can't go again.	Sinshobora kongera kugenda.
And it was great	Kandi byari byiza cyane
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
I think he just meant it	Ntekereza ko yashakaga kuvuga gusa
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
Now I want to do it.	Ubu ndashaka kubikora.
I knew he was out	Nari nzi ko ari hanze
I want to do something on my own	Ndashaka gukora ikintu wenyine
The party went well.	Ibirori byagenze neza.
I don't know where he went.	Sinzi aho yagiye.
He didn’t just want to win.	Ntiyashakaga gutsinda gusa.
I was not sure what he was up to	Sinari nzi neza neza icyo yari akiri
He was not here.	Ntabwo yari hano.
It's a plan.	Ni gahunda.
They know, now, what we have.	Bazi, ubu, ibyo dufite.
I had a very nice house	Nari mfite inzu nziza cyane
I don’t want to see him do it again	Sinshaka kongera kubona uko akora
I didn't want to have anything to do with anyone	Sinifuzaga kugira icyo nkora n'umuntu uwo ari we wese
I know that's a bad thing to say	Nzi ko aricyo kintu kibi cyo kuvuga
He has nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe ashaka kuvuga.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
Good time	Igihe cyiza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
And that may well be the end of it all.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka ko amaherezo azaba ikintu cyiza.
He had a car.	Yari afite imodoka.
I thought he had a lot of luck	Natekereje ko afite amahirwe menshi
I think it is very good	Ndakeka ko ari mwiza cyane
I should have known everything	Nari nkwiye kumenya byose
He wanted to learn everything tonight.	Yashakaga kwiga byose muri iri joro.
I can work for a long time	Nshobora gukora igihe kirekire
I did something good	Nakoze ku kintu cyiza
I just wanted to make sure it was there	Nashakaga gusa kumenya neza ko ahari
It was just the truth.	Byari ukuri gusa.
He knows who he trusts.	Azi uwo yizeye.
Finally, he said something.	Amaherezo, yagize icyo avuga.
You need to be, really.	Ukeneye kuba, mubyukuri.
I think that happened quickly and efficiently.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byagenze vuba kandi neza.
I feel lucky to be your daughter	Ndumva mfite amahirwe yo kuba umukobwa wawe
I need it here.	Nkeneye hano.
Most people have	Abantu benshi bafite
Tell the boy.	Bwira umuhungu.
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye iyo uri.
He did not ask the question.	Ntabwo yabajije icyo kibazo.
We have to be here.	Tugomba kuba hano.
He is at home.	Ari murugo.
Everyone was outside but him.	Abantu bose bari hanze ariko we.
I was so beautiful.	Nari mwiza cyane.
It is best to stop this for a long time.	Nibyiza guhagarika ibi igihe kirekire.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I did nothing wrong	Nta kibi nakoze
That you are a good young man.	Ko uri umusore mwiza.
I'm sure that	Nzi neza ko ibyo
Play well.	Gukina neza.
I had a plan to work	Nari mfite gahunda yo gukora
I thought, we have to get out of this.	Natekereje, tugomba kuva muri ibi.
But he loved everyone.	Ariko yakundaga abantu bose.
I'm doing it a lot.	Ndimo kubikora cyane.
I didn't know where we were	Sinari nzi aho turi
He didn’t have to go far.	Ntabwo yagombaga kujya kure.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
But that was not the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
That was a good reason	Iyo yari impamvu nziza
He was very fond of his wife.	Yakundaga cyane umugore we.
I am the best of them all	Ndi mwiza kuruta bose
This is not good at all.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza rwose.
He was not ready to talk to you.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye kuvugana nawe.
I needed it now	Nari nkeneye ubu
He said he needed a friend.	Yavuze ko akeneye inshuti.
I noticed that they were very close	Nigeze kubona ko bari hafi cyane
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nkaho aricyo kibazo.
I have what you may want	Mfite ibyo ushobora kuba ushaka
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo rimwe na rimwe.
You can't tell where you are.	Ntushobora kumenya aho uri.
I knew he would be.	Nari nzi ko azaba.
I knew better than that	Nari nzi neza kuruta ibyo
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
He was very lucky.	Yagize amahirwe menshi.
But no one said anything.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira icyo avuga.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
I know you want to win.	Nzi ko ushaka gutsinda.
I wanted to be out	Nashakaga kuba hanze
We can't help this.	Ntidushobora gufasha ibi.
You don't have to do this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I just can't believe he's gone	Gusa sinshobora kwizera ko yagiye
I really thought he was a good person	Natekerezaga rwose ko ari umuntu mwiza
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She wants to go back to school and do something on her own.	Ashaka gusubira ku ishuri no gukora ikintu wenyine.
I have to live with you	Ngomba kubana nawe
And soon.	Kandi vuba.
I'm out doing something.	Ndi hanze nkora ikintu.
I really wanted to help	Nashakaga rwose gufasha
I always think	Ntekereza buri gihe
We have to do it again.	Tugomba kongera kubikora.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
I can't figure out the problem.	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya ikibazo.
He didn't really do it.	Ntabwo rwose yabikoze.
Later this week, if so.	Nyuma kuri iki cyumweru, niba aribyo.
I'm glad about that	Nishimiye ibyo kuri we
And you know what you know.	Kandi uzi ibyo uzi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I had problems.	Nagize ibibazo.
And we needed it at the time.	Kandi twari dukeneye icyo gihe.
I hope he will be there this morning	Nizere ko azaba ahari muri iki gitondo
Or maybe it was, obviously.	Cyangwa yigeze kuba, biragaragara.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
He wanted a way to do that.	Yashakaga uburyo bwo kubikora.
I really thought he was a good guy	Natekerezaga rwose ko ari umusore mwiza
That was a man.	Uwo yari umuntu.
I'm sorry about that	Mbabajwe nawe
I think ahead here.	Ndatekereza imbere hano.
I never thought you were her daughter	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza ko uri umukobwa we
He got a job.	Yabonye akazi.
I have to go	Ngomba kugenda
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
I don’t think he’s the only one	Ndatekereza ko atari we wenyine
I have another problem.	Mfite ikindi kibazo.
It's you later.	Ni wowe nyuma.
I have to try to stop this	Ngomba kugerageza guhagarika ibi
You can't think of anything.	Ntushobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe.
I was not here to return	Ntabwo nari hano gutaha
Especially if they have children.	Cyane cyane niba bafite abana.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
I have a lot to say	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga
He was then.	Icyo gihe yari.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
None of us got it right.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wabonye neza.
I’m also glad he agreed with me	Nishimiye kandi ko yemeye nanjye
I can only eat.	Nshobora kurya gusa.
.	.
At the time, I didn't hear anything	Icyo gihe nta kintu na kimwe numvise
It looks like he found someone happy.	Birasa nkaho yabonye umuntu yishimiye.
He had no one else to do that.	Ntabwo yari afite umuntu uwo ari we wese ukora gutya.
All, most likely, the truth.	Byose, birashoboka cyane, ukuri.
I can't say right now	Sinshobora kuvuga ubu
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I need to go home with someone	Nkeneye gutaha hamwe numuntu
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
He took something else.	Yafashe ikindi kintu.
I feel something behind me, now	Ndumva ikintu inyuma yanjye, ubu
We have to eat.	Tugomba kurya.
I want to be here	Ndashaka ko hano hano

You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza cyane.
If he has time.	Niba afite umwanya.
I thought he had a short time	Natekereje ko afite igihe gito
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
I am very far away.	Ndi kure cyane.
I don't hear anyone	Nta muntu n'umwe numva
He asked.	Yabajije.
But that would not have happened.	Ariko ntabwo byari kugenda.
I need to know how to live	Nkeneye kumenya uburyo bwo kubaho
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
I thought that was good.	Natekereje ko ibyo byari byiza.
You are.	Urimo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose
I only have one problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe gusa
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
No need to work.	Nta mpamvu yo gukora.
I hope you were in prison	Ndizera ko wari muri gereza
I feel so wrong here	Ndumva mfite amakosa cyane hano
I didn't know you were here	Sinari nzi ko uri hano
It was great to see everyone here.	Byari byiza kubona abantu bose hano.
I want to hear what he has to say	Ndashaka kumva icyo avuga
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari nyuma.
He has no phone.	Nta terefone afite.
You have to think that way.	Ugomba gutekereza gutya.
I can do it	Nshobora kubikora
I wonder if anyone can help	Ndabaza niba hari ushobora gufasha
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
Not enough to do.	Ntabwo bihagije gukora.
I thought the same thing about you	Natekereje kimwe nawe
He thought maybe he wasn't.	Yatekereje ko ahari atari we.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nibyo.
We are just.	Turi gusa.
And it’s not just work.	Kandi si akazi gusa.
He wanted to go fast.	Yashakaga kugenda vuba.
Going to stop that.	Kujya guhagarika ibyo.
If, if, if.	Niba, niba, niba.
I never thought about this	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibi
It was here.	Byari hano.
The truth is, she is beautiful.	Ukuri nuko, ari mwiza.
No up and down.	Nta hejuru kandi hasi.
I thought he was doing well	Natekereje ko akora neza
He was not a bad guy.	Ntiyari umusore mubi.
Everything.	Byose.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I was not a good friend	Ntabwo nari inshuti nziza
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibyo ni byo rwose.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
Very good thing	Ikintu cyiza cyane
Only.	Gusa.
I didn't want him to leave	Ntabwo nashakaga ko agenda
I have very good friends	Mfite inshuti nziza cyane
Finding it a little difficult.	Kubona bigoye gato.
He was only three at the time.	Icyo gihe yari afite imyaka itatu gusa.
I thought he was human	Natekereje ko ari umuntu
I think that's what I like	Ntekereza ko aribyo nkunda
I'm worried about him	Mfite impungenge kuri we
I wanted to go home.	Nashakaga gutaha.
I was worried he might be right	Nari mfite impungenge ko ashobora kuba afite ukuri
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
Only money. 	Amafaranga gusa. 
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
But more.	Ariko ikindi.
I can't go back	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma
It's good at home.	Nibyiza murugo.
That was really smart.	Ibyo byari ubwenge rwose.
I want what you have	Ndashaka ibyo ufite
I can't be near you	Sinshobora kuba hafi yawe
I like simple things	Nkunda ibintu byoroshye
I didn’t want to think about any of that	Sinifuzaga gutekereza kuri kimwe muri ibyo
But of course not.	Ariko rwose sibyo.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
He used to talk about clothes.	Yakundaga kuvuga imyenda.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
I can't go back to that house	Sinshobora gusubira muri iyo nzu
I understand everything now.	Ndumva byose ubu.
But to be many.	Ariko kuba benshi.
He wanted to, maybe, do a lot of things.	Yashakaga, ahari, gukora ibintu byinshi.
He needed a job.	Yari akeneye akazi.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I am very happy to buy	Nishimiye cyane kugura
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
Now he is gone.	Ubu yagiye.
Most of my favorites here.	Byinshi nkunda hano.
That is not the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
I once did his wife	Nanjye nigeze gukora umugore we
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari ukuri.
I was bad for him	Nari mubi kuri we
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
It was good, and good.	Byari byiza, kandi neza.
They were close.	Bari hafi.
It is also possible to play something.	Birashoboka kandi gukina ikintu.
I didn't know you could play that way	Sinari nzi ko ushobora gukina gutya
She was well dressed now.	Yari yambaye neza ubu.
And all is well.	Kandi byose ni byiza.
That's great !.	Nibyiza cyane!.
I'm not here.	Ntabwo ndi hano.
He would hear nothing.	Nta cyo yari kumva.
I needed them all, now	Nari nkeneye bose, ubu
He has a lot to say.	Afite byinshi byo kuvuga.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You can't really do that.	Ntushobora kubikora mubyukuri.
I saw it and it was great.	Nabonye kandi byari byiza cyane.
You are alone.	Mubyukuri uri wenyine.
Reka.	Reka.
The only woman he ever loved.	Umugore wenyine yigeze akunda.
I need something good	Nkeneye ikintu cyiza
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I did not know his problem	Sinari nzi ikibazo cye
At home.	Ku nzu.
He just had problems, or he was.	Afite ibibazo gusa, cyangwa yari.
I can't stay here	Sinshobora kuguma hano
I wonder if this is possible.	Ndabaza niba ibi bishoboka.
You have to go back.	Ugomba gusubira inyuma.
I thought so badly	Natekereje nabi cyane
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
You can stay here.	Urashobora kuguma hano.
I need to do things right	Nkeneye gukora ibintu neza
One day we may feel the way.	Umunsi umwe dushobora kumva uburyo.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
I never believed in an idea.	Sinigeze nizera igitekerezo.
I was a child.	Nari umwana.
I enjoy a good car	Nishimiye imodoka nziza
But that was not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntacyo byari byo.
I saw this above	Nabonye ibi hejuru
Time to try.	Igihe cyo kugerageza.
And he.	Na we.
You really don't do anything.	Ntabwo rwose ukora ikintu na kimwe.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
He may have problems.	Ashobora kugira ibibazo.
For the first time.	Bwa mbere.
He has to try one of each, maybe.	Agomba kugerageza kimwe muri buri, birashoboka.
I'm just so scared.	Gusa mfite ubwoba cyane.
Friends are right.	Inshuti nibyo.
I want to know more	Ndashaka kumenya neza
It would be nice if anyone could help.	Byaba byiza umuntu wese ashobora gufasha.
I want to hear it again	Ndashaka kongera kumva
I understand why they are here	Ndumva impamvu bari hano
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I was so bad	Nari mubi cyane
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I like to read more than anything else	Nkunda gusoma kuruta ikindi kintu cyose
But what can one do.	Ariko icyo umuntu ashobora gukora.
He had no reason.	Nta mpamvu yari afite.
I was on one recently	Nari kuri umwe vuba aha
I would have known then that it was not	Nari kumenya icyo gihe ko atari byo
And it's the same.	Kandi ni kimwe.
I wanted to talk to you early	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe kare
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
I don't know where they are	Sinzi aho bari
I knew exactly what to do	Nari nzi neza icyo yari gukora
That's what they would tell me.	Nibyo bari kumbwira.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I want to go home now	Ndashaka gutaha ubu
When he was near.	Iyo yari hafi.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You are not the first person to do this.	Ntabwo uri umuntu wa mbere wabikoze.
I didn't see why we should do that	Ntabwo nabonye impamvu natwe tugomba kubikora
He could be a bad person.	Ashobora kuba umuntu mubi.
It will be better for him.	Bizaba byiza kuri we.
I don’t think that was good.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ibyo byari byiza.
We have to wait.	Tugomba gutegereza.
Wisdom is the best.	Ubwenge nibyiza cyane.
I have a lot to look forward to.	Mfite byinshi byo gutegereza.
I need to go.	Nkeneye kugenda.
I can't take the house	Sinshobora gufata inzu
And what is this.	Kandi ni iki.
I haven't seen it yet	Ntabwo nabonye kugeza uyu munsi
I wanted something for him	Nashakaga ikintu kuri we
I needed a lot for him	Nari nkeneye byinshi kuri we
I have to leave	Ngomba kuva aho
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari.
As it happened.	Nkuko byagenze.
Never.	Nta na rimwe.
'he said.	' yavuze.
I'm just a good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza gusa.
I was a bad girl	Nari umukobwa mubi
I thought, today is going to be a good day	Natekereje, uyumunsi ugiye kuba umunsi mwiza
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I can't speak either	Nanjye sinshobora kuvuga
I didn’t want to give up living with him	Sinifuzaga kureka kubana na we
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni mbere ya byose.
We have time.	Dufite umwanya.
I did something else	Nakoze ikindi kintu
But you are the one who can help.	Ariko ni wowe ushobora gufasha.
Everyone.	Umuntu wese.
I just didn't see it.	Gusa sinigeze mbona.
And for me.	Kandi kuri njye.
Drinking time	Igihe cyo kunywa.
And he.	Na we.
I can't see	Ntabwo nshobora kubona
It all started.	Yatangiye byose.
Something.	Ikintu.
But you said nothing.	Ariko ntacyo wavuze.
One can speak	Umuntu arashobora kuvuga
'to'.	'kuri'.
He tried to help.	Yagerageje gufasha.
I'm not in my clothes.	Ntabwo ndi imyenda yanjye.
I really want to	Ndashaka rwose
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
She is a teacher.	Ni umwarimu.
I can't get enough of it !.	Sinshobora kubona bihagije!.
We.	Ni.
Nothing is true.	Nta kintu na kimwe ari ukuri.
Not much to stop.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo guhagarika.
No one knew where he was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho ari.
But, if you want to stay here, you can do it.	Ariko, niba ushaka kuguma hano, urashobora kubikora.
But so far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Ariko, kuri ubu nta muntu wabikoze.
I know everything is true	Nzi ko byose ari ukuri
This is him.	Uyu ni we.
I love my family very much	Nkunda umuryango wanjye cyane
It's a good thing for me.	Ni ikintu cyiza kuri njye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, yavuze ko afite.
I saw this above.	Nabonye ibi hejuru.
I was not good to him	Ntabwo nari mwiza kuri we
I enjoyed this, but it is very possible	Nari nishimiye ibi, ariko birashoboka cyane
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
I knew he was close by now	Nari nzi ko ari hafi ubu
I have people in everything	Mfite abantu muri buri kintu
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
It was not bad.	Ntiyari mubi.
He would eat.	Yari kurya.
He was worried, who.	Yari afite impungenge, uwo.
You don't have to work hard.	Ntugomba gukora cyane.
Make a lot of money.	Kugira amafaranga menshi.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
I'm not sure	Ntabwo nzi neza
But we have a problem.	Ariko dufite ikibazo.
In good time the plan came.	Mugihe cyiza gahunda yaje.
That's right.	Nukuri.
If so, you may be thinking.	Niba aribyo, ushobora gutekereza neza.
He has friends here.	Afite inshuti hano.
You know that.	Uzi ko aribyo.
However, we cannot.	Ariko, ntidushobora.
He always has a little boy.	Afite umuhungu muto buri gihe.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
I have a good idea	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza
And here's the thing.	Kandi hano hari ikintu cyiza.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
It's almost there.	Hafi gato.
I want to see everything he has	Ndashaka kubona ibyo afite byose
I was the first person to see it	Ninjye muntu wa mbere yabonye
To stop.	Guhagarika.
And you have to be realistic.	Kandi ugomba kumenya neza.
I am very low	Ndi hasi cyane
There is a lot of good advice here.	Hano hari inama nyinshi nziza.
Not really.	Mubyukuri sibyo.
He heard nothing.	Nta cyo yumvise.
After all, everything went well.	Nyuma, ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I need to talk to you now	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe ubu
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I can't think of anything like that	Sinshobora gutekereza gutya
And it is.	Kandi ni.
I can't see this.	Sinshobora kubona ibi.
I can't think of anything right now	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri iki gihe
Everything is.	Ibintu byose ni.
I never worked in prison	Sinigeze nkora igihe muri gereza
And he can.	Kandi arashobora.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Going to jail, of course, was not on the agenda.	Kujya muri gereza, rwose ntabwo byari muri gahunda.
It's us.	Ni twe.
He says it's great.	Avuga ko ari byiza cyane.
That's really cool.	Ibyo ni byiza rwose.
I need to know who	Nkeneye kumenya uwo
It's good to get a job	Nibyiza kubona akazi
I know it's not easy	Nzi ko atari ibintu byoroshye
He had no one.	Nta muntu yari afite.
I would hear.	Nari kumva.
I can't say	Sinshobora kuvuga
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He did it on his own.	Yabikoze wenyine wenyine.
I was not close.	Ntabwo nari hafi.
He seems to be doing well inside.	Asa nkaho akora neza imbere.
What we were.	Icyo twari cyo.
It was not just a matter of time.	Ntabwo byari ibintu gusa.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
I just did.	Nakoze gusa.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
I see.	Njye mbona.
He didn’t try especially.	Ntabwo yagerageje cyane cyane.
I was looking for something else	Nashakaga ikindi kintu
I didn’t think you had it in you	Sinatekerezaga ko ufite muri wowe
Seeing something.	Kubona ikintu.
I mean, we all have what we have	Ndashaka kuvuga, twese dufite ibyo dufite
He feels useless and gone.	Yumva ntacyo amaze kandi yagiye.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I don't have much time.	Ntabwo mfite igihe kinini.
I find that to be good and normal.	Njye mbona ibyo ari byiza kandi bisanzwe.
It's good and good.	Nibyiza kandi neza.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
I never thought he was alone.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ari wenyine.
That was great to help make it work.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane gufasha gukora.
I'm not doing this.	Ntabwo nkora ibi.
I have to eat	Ngomba gukora kurya
You need to stay.	Ukeneye kuguma.
I am happy to be with him	Nishimiye kubana na we
I think he was scared	Ntekereza ko yari afite ubwoba
I needed to do something about him	Nari nkeneye kugira icyo nkora kuri we
One day he will be there.	Umunsi umwe azaba ahari.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
I'm not sure if it's true	Sinzi neza niba ari ukuri
I thought so	Natekereje ko aribyo
At that time I did not know	Icyo gihe sinari nzi
I do not understand.	Ntabwo ndumva.
I was not going to give up.	Ntabwo nari ngiye kureka.
I didn't get the time	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
He went alone.	Yagiye wenyine.
I really should stop looking.	Nkwiye rwose kureka kureba.
Come here.	Kuza hano.
I was not inside	Ntabwo nari imbere
It is not a plan.	Ntabwo ari gahunda.
But we have to look at my house now.	Ariko tugomba kureba inzu yanjye ubu.
He also saw nothing.	Na we ntacyo yabonye.
I don't want to live	Sinshaka kubaho
And especially today.	Kandi cyane cyane muri iki gihe.
I didn’t want to look away.	Sinifuzaga kureba kure.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari nibyiza cyane.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I think that will all happen	Ntekereza ko ibyo bizaba byose
I want to take this	Ndashaka gufata iki
You, however, are not.	Wowe ariko, ntabwo.
I knew it wasn't him	Nari nzi ko atari we
I don't think so	Ntabwo numva ari byo
This has been true until recently.	Ibi byari ukuri kugeza vuba aha.
And this is it.	Kandi iyi ni.
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
He wants to win.	Arashaka gutsinda.
I can do everything.	Nshobora byose.
And if that's the case, then it's okay.	Niba kandi aribyo, nibyiza.
Today was a wonderful day	Uyu munsi nagize umunsi mwiza
There’s a lot, really.	Hariho byinshi, mubyukuri.
I need to learn faith.	Nkeneye kwiga kwizera.
I need something to eat.	Nkeneye ikintu cyo kurya.
But let this be.	Ariko reka ibi.
He seemed to be doing everything right.	Yasaga naho akora byose neza.
It's good to have you here.	Nibyiza kuba ufite hano.
I was so beautiful alone.	Nari mwiza cyane wenyine.
More than the same.	Kurenza kandi kimwe.
I may have to deal with that	Nshobora kuba ngomba kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo
You have the opportunity to be here tonight.	Ufite amahirwe yo kuba hano iri joro.
I don’t even know what he’s doing.	Ntazi mbere ibyo akora.
I think no one has money	Ntekereza ko nta muntu ufite amafaranga
It’s not that he doesn’t have things.	Ntabwo ari uko atari afite ibintu.
I want to leave here	Ndashaka kuva hano
I'm not doing that	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora
I can't get my phone	Sinshobora kubona terefone yanjye
I have been here since yesterday	Ndi hano kuva ejo
I was three years old at the time	Icyo gihe nari mfite imyaka itatu
I believe he was bad	Nizera ko yari mubi
He wanted only one thing.	Yashakaga ikintu kimwe gusa.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ibyo byoroshye.
You were here.	Wari hano.
Either way he deserved both.	Ibyo ari byo byose yari akwiye bombi.
But not soon.	Ariko si vuba.
At home, he hopes.	Murugo, yizeye.
He saw that they had.	Yabonye ko bari bafite.
I'm not him.	Ntabwo ndi we.
And he used to eat everything.	Kandi yakundaga kurya ibintu byose.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
They wouldn't know if it was.	Ntabwo bari kumenya niba ari.
I have to go today	Ngomba kugenda uyu munsi
Quit.	Kureka.
She is not her child.	Ntabwo ari umwana we.
Everyone is scared.	Abantu bose bafite ubwoba.
He got it right.	Yabonye neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
There is only you and me.	Hariho wowe na njye gusa.
I needed it tomorrow	Nari nkeneye ejo
I never saw him like that	Sinigeze mbona nka we
I can't think of a place	Sinshobora gutekereza aho
Everyone has everything they need.	Umuntu wese afite ibintu byose bihagije.
I know he likes to feel like I'm in it	Nzi ko akunda kumva ko ndi muri njye
I knew the plan.	Nari nzi gahunda.
The only problem is where.	Ikibazo gusa ni he.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I needed to do things right with you	Nari nkeneye gukora ibintu neza nawe
I wanted to do it.	Nashakaga kubikora.
I have a problem with that.	Mfite ikibazo kuri ibyo.
She is a very good teacher.	Ni umwarimu mwiza cyane.
I didn't think about it at all	Ntabwo natekereje kuri byose
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You knew the guy who could see everything, you said.	Wari uzi umusore ushobora kubona ikintu cyose, wavuze.
And so many things for us.	Kandi ibintu byinshi cyane kuri twe.
He wanted to learn more.	Yashakaga kwiga byinshi.
I also feel very good	Nanjye numvise uri mwiza cyane
I needed to do something quick	Nari nkeneye gukora ikintu vuba
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I want to do more	Ndashaka gukora byinshi
He may be good.	Ashobora kuba mwiza.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.
I didn’t know the family.	Sinari nzi umuryango.
I want to be human	Ndashaka kuba umuntu
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose
I know it's a lot of money	Nzi ko ari amafaranga menshi
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
It hadn't been long.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe kinini.
Going.	Kujya.
But he heard nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yumvise.
I saw someone inside	Nabonye umuntu imbere
There is a problem for me	Hariho ikibazo kuri njye
I wanted to go from behind	Nashakaga kuva inyuma
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
I like to be scared	Nkunda kugira ubwoba
I think this is a good idea	Ntekereza ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza
There is so much he doesn't know.	Hariho byinshi atari azi.
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
You like to play tennis.	Ukunda gukina tennis.
I can't say who he is.	Sinshobora kuvuga uwo ari we.
I know nothing about this	Ntacyo nzi kuri ibi
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
Before.	Mbere.
I can't wait to learn how to drive	Sinshobora gutegereza kwiga uburyo bwo gutwara
I just didn't see it	Gusa sinigeze mbona
This is one of us.	Ubu ni umwe muri twe.
He just wanted to give up.	Yashakaga gusa kureka.
I'm not happy about driving	Ntabwo nishimiye gutwara imodoka
We must really stop doing that.	Tugomba rwose guhagarika gukora ibyo.
And he would want to.	Kandi yari gushaka.
I'm not sure when.	Sinzi neza igihe.
Just the truth, please.	Ukuri gusa, nyamuneka.
I have good things to do.	Mfite ibintu byiza byo gukora.
I was a little kid, sometimes	Nari umwana muto, rimwe na rimwe
That it is only one thing.	Ko ari ikintu kimwe gusa.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I can't understand this problem.	Sinshobora kumva iki kibazo.
Like many.	Kimwe na benshi.
People were far away.	Abantu bari kure cyane.
I should be outside	Nkwiye kuba hanze
I knew he was worried about me	Nari nzi ko yari afite impungenge kuri njye
Nowhere.	Nta na hamwe.
He was ready to leave, at any time.	Yari yiteguye kugenda, igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
It would be great	Byaba byiza rwose
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
'	'
He was very lucky.	Yagize amahirwe menshi.
You don't know any of that.	Ntabwo uzi kimwe muri byo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I don't want to look too far	Sinshaka kureba kure cyane
I didn’t think that was good	Sinatekerezaga ko ibyo byari byiza
I really think so.	Ndatekereza rwose ko aribyo.
I have to give up everything	Ngomba kureka byose
He said good things.	Yavuze ibintu byiza.
I can do anything with you behind me	Nshobora gukora ikintu cyose hamwe nawe inyuma yanjye
I want something else	Ndashaka ko hari ikindi kintu
I have access to a lot of things later	Mfite uburyo bwo kubona ibintu byinshi nyuma
One is a child.	Umwe ni umwana.
I never wanted to.	Sinigeze nshaka.
Or he went out.	Cyangwa yagiye hanze.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I am the only one here.	Hano ni njye wenyine.
Tonight, if possible.	Iri joro, niba bishoboka.
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
He really wanted to do more.	Mubyukuri yashakaga gukora byinshi.
I know who he is	Nzi ko uwo ari we
At times, he did not know how.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntiyari azi uko.
I wasn't good enough	Ntabwo nari mwiza bihagije
We were home at the time.	Icyo gihe twari murugo.
But this is not the case.	Ariko si uyu.
But he did not begin to speak.	Ariko ntabwo yatangiye kuvuga.
I didn't really need it.	Sinari nkeneye rwose.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi rwose ni byo.
Back to his room.	Gusubira mu cyumba cye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
The woman had done the work	Umugore yari yakoze akazi
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
I mean a lot.	Ndashaka kuvuga cyane.
At the time, things were not going well.	Icyo gihe, ibintu ntabwo byagenze.
I never saw much of him	Ntabwo nigeze mbona byinshi muri we
He felt he had made a choice.	Yumvise ko yahisemo.
I never thought of this	Sinigeze ntekereza ibi
You are a good young man.	Uri umusore mwiza.
This is a good thing.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza.
Me too.	Nanjye.
I don’t know how, or why, but it is	Ntabwo nzi uburyo, cyangwa impamvu, ariko ni
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I knew he had something in mind	Nari nzi ko hari icyo atekereza
But you don’t have to be.	Ariko ntugomba kuba.
You want to help.	Ushaka gufasha.
He should have been here.	Yari akwiye kuba hano.
There was one more thing he had to do first.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe yagombaga gukora mbere.
Until.	Kugeza.
I needed to make friends	Nari nkeneye gushaka inshuti
But then, here we are.	Ariko aho, hano turi.
I love it, it's really good.	Nkunda, nibyiza rwose.
I knew exactly what he was saying	Nari nzi neza ibyo avuga
Food.	Ibiryo.
He can stay here.	Arashobora kuguma hano.
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo.
So far everything has gone well.	Kugeza ubu ibintu byose byagenze neza.
One time.	Umwanya umwe.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Kundusha.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
I have seen and heard enough	Nabonye kandi numvise bihagije
He is not young.	Ntabwo ari muto.
I was in.	Nari ndimo.
I'm really sorry tomorrow	Mbabajwe rwose ejo
You are going to learn to be good.	Ugiye kwiga kuba mwiza.
I wonder if he can even get it	Ndabaza niba ashobora no kubona
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
He seemed to be alone.	Yasaga naho ari wenyine.
No one could talk about this.	Nta muntu n'umwe yashoboraga kuvugana kuri ibi.
Do you want to play?	Urashaka gukina?.
It's good enough, it's good.	Nibyiza bihagije, nibyiza.
No one was around.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hafi ye.
I wanted to know if you have an idea	Nashakaga kumenya niba ufite igitekerezo
I didn’t know they were out today	Sinari nzi ko bari hanze uyu munsi
And so it is.	Na we ni uko.
I have an idea right now	Mfite igitekerezo kuri ubu
Reka.	Reka.
I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva.
The idea is the same.	Igitekerezo ni ikintu kimwe.
For him, the thing is a friend.	Kuri we, icyo kintu ni inshuti.
I made a lot of mistakes that day	Uwo munsi nakoze amakosa menshi
I never thought it would work out	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza gukora neza
You can't tell what it is.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo aricyo.
You haven't said anything since.	Kuva icyo gihe ntacyo wavuze.
Everyone knows his place.	Abantu bose bazi umwanya we.
He thought	Yatekereje
He must be ready.	Agomba kuba yiteguye.
Baby? 	Umwana?
He is leaving.	Arimo kugenda.
He was probably both.	Birashoboka ko yari bombi.
It's too bad.	Ni mubi cyane.
I thought it was a good plan	Natekereje ko ari gahunda nziza
I love this time with her	Nkunda iki gihe hamwe na we
I didn't know anything	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo cyose
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I can't.	Sinshobora no.
Question for him.	Ikibazo kuri we.
But close.	Ariko hafi.
I can't figure out what happened	Sinshobora kumenya uko byagenze
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
I need to go back	Nkeneye gusubira imbere
I can't live well	Sinshobora kubaho neza
That's right now.	Nibyo kuri ubu.
I think it would be better for that.	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza kuri ibyo.
Glad you are here !.	Nishimiye ko uri hano!.
I didn't see it coming	Ntabwo nabonye kuza
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I was young.	Nari muto.
Down from above.	Hasi kuva hejuru.
But this is true.	Ariko iyi ni ukuri.
I can have.	Nshobora kugira.
There are people upstairs, but not many.	Hariho abantu hejuru, ariko si benshi.
Lots.	Byinshi.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
He knew he shouldn't.	Yari azi ko atagomba.
They both had.	Bombi bari bafite.
That was true as it happened.	Ibyo byari ukuri uko byagenze.
This is what they have	Ibi ni byo bafite
That would be great.	Ibyo bizaba byiza rwose.
Not much at all.	Ntabwo ari byinshi na gato.
I enjoyed this one	Nishimiye iyi
Maybe I have nothing	Birashoboka ko ntacyo mfite
I want that too, and soon	Nanjye ndashaka aho, kandi vuba
And more.	Kandi byinshi.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
In fact, that day cannot come.	Mubyukuri, uwo munsi ntushobora kuza.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
It’s a good idea to wait a bit.	Nibyiza gutegereza gato.
I have everything here	Mfite ibintu byose hano
Her son left that day.	Uwo munsi umuhungu we yagiye.
No one seems to be home.	Nta muntu n'umwe usa nkaho ari murugo.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo yagombaga gukora.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
That’s what I was thinking the most	Icyo ni cyo natekerezaga cyane
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
I really thought that would work.	Natekerezaga rwose ko ibyo byari gukora.
But we are all human.	Ariko twese turi abantu.
A short time.	Igihe gito.
No one would hear.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kumva.
I can't understand how	Sinshobora kumva uburyo
I just thought of something	Gusa natekereje ku kintu
And he would do it again.	Kandi yari kongera kubikora.
I didn't hear anything later	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise nyuma
I want to see one of those	Ndashaka kubona kimwe muri ibyo
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo yari gukora
I would like to go see a movie	Ndashaka kujya kureba firime
It was hard for everyone.	Byari bigoye kuri buri wese.
It was on schedule.	Byari muri gahunda.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
Eventually, he got to where I am.	Amaherezo, yaje aho ndi.
I like to do it	Nkunda kubikora
I may come tonight but not	Nshobora kuza muri iri joro ariko sibyo
I want to quit	Ndashaka kureka
I can't say for sure	Sinshobora kuvuga neza igihe
It's not scary.	Ntabwo ari ubwoba.
But, let.	Ariko, reka.
In each room.	Muri buri cyumba kimwe.
She felt embarrassed.	Yumvise afite isoni.
No one knows everything.	Nta muntu n'umwe uzi byose.
I hope that is good for everyone	Nizere ko ibyo ari byiza kuri buri wese
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko aricyo kintu.
I know what we can be	Nzi icyo dushobora kuba cyo
It's a bigger problem.	Ni ikibazo kinini kuruta ibyo.
I had a lot of people away from me.	Nari mfite abantu benshi kure yanjye.
He has never done that before.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora mbere.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
Most of the time, no reading.	Igihe kinini, nta gusoma.
I have a very good feeling now that it looks like	Mfite kumva neza cyane ubu birasa
Come to him.	Kuza kuri we.
I can't wait.	Sinshobora gutegereza.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
And he knew what to do.	Kandi yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
For him, for one.	Kuri we, kuri umwe.
It was a test case	Byari ikibazo cyo kugerageza
I was not very skilled	Ntabwo nari umuhanga cyane
He had only one problem.	Yari afite ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I didn't really need it	Sinari nkeneye cyane
It's normal.	Ni ibintu bisanzwe.
That is very true today.	Ibyo ni ukuri cyane muri iki gihe.
I can carry something else	Nshobora gutwara ikindi kintu
I just didn’t know exactly where	Gusa sinari nzi neza aho
I didn't know he was going to do it	Sinari nzi ko agiye kubikora
And maybe we were.	Kandi birashoboka ko twari.
You were right about him.	Wari ukuri kuri we.
I can't talk to you right now	Sinshobora kuvugana nawe nonaha
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
I know who he is	Nzi uwo ari we
He expected it to be good.	Yari yiteze ko bizaba byiza.
We need to say more.	Dukeneye kuvuga byinshi.
You just want the truth.	Urashaka gusa ukuri.
I hear a lot now.	Ndumva byinshi ubu.
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
There is a lot to feel good about.	Hariho byinshi byo kumva neza.
This is not a bad idea.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi.
I really needed to talk to someone	Nari nkeneye rwose kuvugana numuntu
He did not know where they were.	Ntiyari azi aho bari.
I should have taken it	Nari nkwiye gufata
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
The woman was beautiful.	Umugore yari mwiza.
I'm not sure about that	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo
I heard what you were doing	Numvise ibyo ukora
Maybe I should, in fact	Birashoboka ko nkwiye, mubyukuri
I wanted to stay and help	Nashakaga kuguma hamwe no gufasha
I should have gone	Nari nkwiye kugenda
You can't go back.	Ntushobora gusubira inyuma ye.
And it was good for us.	Kandi yari mwiza kuri twe.
I just didn't know when	Gusa sinari nzi neza igihe
I thought he was a very nice person.	Natekereje ko ari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I had a lot to drink	Nari mfite byinshi byo kunywa
This is not advice.	Iyi ntabwo ari inama.
I know why you're here	Nzi impamvu uri hano
It seems to be good	Birasa nkaho ari byiza
I think it would be nice for all of us	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza twese
Absolutely.	Hariho rwose.
Everything he said was true.	Ibyo yavuze byose byari ukuri.
I need to do more.	Nkeneye gukora byinshi.
I didn't want money	Ntabwo nashakaga amafaranga
He was not there.	Ntiyigeze ahari.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
I can't trust anyone here	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera umuntu hano
I just needed to drink	Nari nkeneye kunywa gusa
I had everything	Nari mfite ibintu byose
It is one of these houses.	Ni umwe muri iyi nzu.
He says it was a mistake.	Avuga ko byari amakosa.
They know nothing.	Ntacyo bazi.
You are coming alone.	Urimo kuza wenyine.
I was well aware of this	Nari nzi neza ibi
He had time.	Yari afite umwanya.
You can do it.	Ushobora kubikora.
I didn’t know what it was, at the time.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo, icyo gihe.
I think he was there before	Ndatekereza ko yari ahari mbere
But he had something.	Ariko yari afite ikintu.
I know you have the same problem	Nzi ko ufite ikibazo kimwe
Big or small.	Kinini cyangwa gito.
In the morning he had decided what to do.	Mu gitondo yari yahisemo icyo agomba gukora.
Nothing to do, nothing to see or hear.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gukora, nta kintu cyo kubona cyangwa kumva.
It was a good little thing, it really was.	Yari ikintu gito cyiza, rwose yari.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
To, to, to.	Kuri, kuri, ku.
All of this is not easy.	Ibi byose ntabwo byoroshye.
I can't find a job.	Sinshobora kubona akazi.
More than ever.	Kurenza ikindi gihe cyose.
I like to help people	Nkunda gufasha abantu
Everything.	Byose.
That's good for all of us.	Ibyo ni byiza kuri twese.
I knew my child.	Nari nzi umwana wanjye.
I want to be your family	Ndashaka kuba umuryango wawe
I can't go back now.	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
I know exactly what you are doing	Nzi neza ibyo ukora
You can go outside.	Urashobora kujya hanze.
But it is me.	Ariko ni njye.
The car is great.	Imodoka ni nziza.
i don't know what to do	ntabwo nzi icyo gukora
But there is no sight.	Ariko nta no kubona.
Something he wanted.	Ikintu yashakaga.
Especially not you.	Cyane cyane ntabwo ari wowe.
I don't need to do that	Ntacyo nkeneye kubikora
I can't wait.	Sinshobora gutegereza.
This is true.	Ubu ni ukuri.
I feel like a family.	Numva ari umuryango.
I guess he wants to talk to himself	Ndakeka ko yifuza kuvuga wenyine
But in reality, he.	Ariko mubyukuri, we.
A very intelligent girl.	Umukobwa uzi ubwenge cyane.
I have faith.	Mfite kwizera.
In fact, one of the many.	Mubyukuri, kimwe muri byinshi.
I had good things to do	Nari mfite ibintu byiza byo gukora
He had something to do.	Yari afite ibyo gukora.
Does anyone have an idea ?.	Umuntu wese afite igitekerezo?.
I haven't seen it yet.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ubu.
It’s a good thing to do.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I can't talk to him	Sinshobora kuvugana na we
This is obviously not a good thing for all you need.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari ibintu byiza kubyo ukeneye byose.
I don't have to stay here	Ntabwo ngomba kuguma hano
I knew who he was.	Nari nzi uwo ari we.
We were very good friends.	Twari inshuti nziza cyane.
I thought he would be ahead today	Natekerezaga ko azaba ari imbere muri iki gihe
I thought he was in prison	Nari natekereje ko ari muri gereza
It is not a short time.	Ntabwo ari igihe gito.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
Getting a car.	Kubona imodoka.
He was his son.	Yari umuhungu we.
I think for many.	Ntekereza kuri benshi.
I thought you wanted to see	Natekereje ko ushaka kubona
He tried to help	Yagerageje gufasha
He feels nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yumva.
He had no plans.	Nta gahunda yari afite.
I didn't know where we were	Sinari nzi aho turi
But you are.	Ariko uri.
I was about to play with him again.	Nari hafi gusubira gukina na we.
I just need to know why.	Nkeneye gusa kumenya impamvu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
This is exactly what he knew.	Ibi ni byo yashoboraga kumenya neza.
But we are not.	Ariko ntabwo turi.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
I know almost everyone.	Nzi abantu bose hafi.
He was young and handsome as usual.	Yari umusore kandi mwiza nkuko bisanzwe.
That was him.	Uwo yari we.
And not only that.	Kandi sibyo gusa.
But that is not all.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I should have.	Nkwiye kugira.
I understand what he is up to now	Ndumva ibyo arimo ubu
Bad day	Umunsi mubi.
It looks so good.	Birasa neza cyane.
Looks like it's a new movie.	Birasa nkaho ari firime nshya.
But it was a wonderful experience.	Ariko byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I'm in the movie.	Ndi muri firime.
I have a lot to do	Mfite ibintu byinshi byo gukora
He had a chance to win.	Yagize amahirwe yo gutsinda.
Today.	Uyu munsi.
That's great for me.	Ibyo ni byiza cyane kuri njye.
I haven't had a chance before	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe mbere
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.
No one knew what he was talking about.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo avuga.
I guess he was right	Ndakeka ko yari afite ukuri
I wanted to know the truth	Nashakaga kumenya ukuri
I can't believe what you have here	Sinshobora kwizera ibyo ufite hano
Everything was on schedule.	Ibintu byose byari kuri gahunda.
I don’t know if this is a good idea or not.	Sinzi niba iki ari igitekerezo cyiza cyangwa atari cyo.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
Maybe this is possible.	Ahari ibi, birashoboka.
Whatever it was, it was true.	Ibyo aribyo byose, byari ukuri.
I think that's a good thing	Ntekereza ko icyo ari ikintu cyiza
I ask what.	Ndabaza iki.
This is very good.	Iyi ni nziza cyane.
Everyone has a place.	Umuntu wese afite umwanya.
I think one of us should stay there	Ntekereza ko umwe muri twe agomba kuguma aho
I think you have to go back.	Ndatekereza ko ugomba gusubira inyuma.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
I can do it all day.	Nshobora kubikora umunsi wose.
I am one young man.	Ndi umusore umwe.
It wasn’t just good.	Ntiyari mwiza gusa.
Eventually, he decided to move on.	Amaherezo, yahisemo kujya imbere.
I never thought we should stay here	Sinigeze ntekereza ko tugomba kuguma hano
I need to find out what I think	Nkeneye gushaka icyo ntekereza
There is something else.	Hari ikindi kintu.
Tell me what happened.	Mbwira uko byagenze.
As much as possible.	Nkuko bishoboka.
He said he just had to look.	Yavuze ko agomba kureba gusa.
He was in.	Yari arimo.
It looks exactly right.	Birasa neza neza.
I know a guy, really	Nzi umusore, mubyukuri
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
You have to get out of here.	Ugomba kuva hano.
I'm glad he didn't.	Nishimiye ko atabikoze.
He could hear everything.	Yashoboraga kumva byose.
I can't live with anyone	Ntabwo nshobora kubana numuntu
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
I'm sorry about that	Mbabajwe n'iki kibazo
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
I mean he has.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko afite.
And that's exactly what happened	Kandi ibyo ni ko byagenze rwose
I didn't want to hear	Sinifuzaga kumva
Here you can feel at home !.	Hano urashobora kumva murugo!.
We are just on the phone.	Turi terefone gusa.
The last thing he wants is something else.	Ikintu cya nyuma ashaka ni ikindi.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
But now he is.	Ariko ubu ari.
I know exactly where it is	Nzi neza aho ari
I was not ashamed	Ntabwo nagize isoni
But there is.	Ariko hariho.
I was well aware	Nari nzi neza
I was very embarrassed	Nagize isoni cyane
It is very likely that you saw the same thing.	Birashoboka cyane ko wabonye ikintu kimwe.
I made a mistake	Nakoze amakosa
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I hope he found someone	Nizere ko yabonye umuntu
You are beautiful too.	Nawe ni mwiza.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
He has to leave today.	Agomba kugenda uyu munsi.
He loves his family.	Akunda umuryango we.
He needed to go.	Yari akeneye kugenda.
I work hard, very hard	Nkora cyane, cyane
You do nothing wrong.	Ntacyo ukora nabi.
Great idea	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane
I never thought he might be right, not really	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ashobora kuba afite ukuri, ntabwo mubyukuri
There is very little time.	Hariho umwanya muto cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
At that point, there is not much you can do.	Icyo gihe, nta byinshi ushobora gukora.
I need a little time	Nkeneye igihe gito
We need a house.	Dukeneye inzu.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
We need help.	Dukeneye ubufasha.
And he is a very bad player	Kandi ni umukinnyi mubi cyane
I didn't know there was a baby	Sinari nzi ko hariho umwana
Everyone.	Abantu bose.
I'm just happy to see something	Nishimiye gusa kubona ikintu
I was food for him	Nari ibiryo kuri we
I was not alone here	Ntabwo nari hano wenyine
And that was good.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza.
I feel like money for me.	Numva ari amafaranga kuri njye.
I can't study easily	Sinshobora kwiga byoroshye
You can't know one of them.	Ntushobora kumenya kimwe muri byo.
And no one saw him go.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wabonye agenda.
I can do a lot of things	Nshobora gukora ibintu byinshi
He went where he is, scared now.	Yagiye aho ari, afite ubwoba ubu.
I find this to be true.	Njye mbona ibi ari ukuri.
Space is short.	Umwanya ni muto.
I shouldn't have been here.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuba hano.
I think he knows everything.	Ntekereza ko azi byose.
I didn't really think about it	Sinatekerezaga rwose
This was all but true.	Ibi byari byose ariko ni ukuri.
It is not a car and it is not a bus.	Ntabwo ari imodoka kandi ntabwo ari bisi.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
I feel like a woman.	Numva ndi umugore.
I never thought he could be bad either	Sinigeze ntekereza ko na we ashobora kuba mubi
None of this is a good reason.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari impamvu nziza.
I mean, it wasn’t good	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo byari byiza
You can have it.	Urashobora kugira.
I hope you want something	Ndizera ko hari icyo ushaka
He loves what he does.	Akunda ibyo akora.
My daughter went here.	Umukobwa wanjye yagiye hano.
You need to make sure you are lucky.	Ugomba kumenya neza ko ufite amahirwe.
He used to think of the same thing on his own.	Yakundaga gutekereza ikintu kimwe wenyine.
I hope there is something to eat	Nizere ko hari ibiryo byo kurya
I didn't know anyone.	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nzi.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hari ikintu yari yabonye.
If anything else.	Niba hari ikindi kintu.
He said enough.	Yavuze bihagije.
The thing is.	Ikintu ni.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
You are not sure of this.	Ntabwo uzi neza ibi.
Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation.	Niki, mubyukuri, biragaragara neza.
I appreciate your gift	Nishimiye impano yawe
I didn't need to think	Sinari nkeneye gutekereza
But one has to say.	Ariko umuntu agomba kuvuga.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
You don't know exactly what you mean.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo ushaka kuvuga neza.
I had to do something about it.	Nari ngomba kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo.
I wanted to live	Nashakaga kubaho
Whatever you want.	Ibyo ushaka byose.
He can win.	Arashobora gutsinda.
You can't be good.	Ntushobora kuba mwiza.
I got it wrong.	Nabonye nabi.
It was not his car.	Ntabwo yari imodoka ye.
I can't wait.	Sinshobora gutegereza.
I'm glad he chose	Nishimiye ko yahisemo
I can't tell if she looks bad or scared	Sinshobora kumenya niba asa nabi cyangwa afite ubwoba
But he could see nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
But you.	Ariko wowe.
I was a bad person to him	Nari umuntu mubi kuri we
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
He saw a lot of things.	Yabonye ibintu byinshi.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I shouldn’t have heard any of that	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kumva kimwe muri byo
Or very likely.	Cyangwa birashoboka cyane.
I didn't know what he knew	Sinari nzi ibyo yari azi
I knew it wasn't far away	Nari nzi ko atari kure
It was his house.	Yari inzu ye.
But he.	Ariko we.
Having a problem finding out why.	Kugira ikibazo cyo kumenya impamvu.
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
The child is gone, gone.	Umwana yagiye, yagiye.
You and your mistakes.	Wowe na amakosa yawe.
He is not ready.	Ntabwo yiteguye.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko.
I wouldn't wait long	Ntabwo nari gutegereza igihe kirekire
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's too far from me.	Ari kure cyane yanjye.
I had this problem once	Nagize iki kibazo rimwe
I want to see	Ndashaka kureba
Tonight was a long time.	Iri joro ryari igihe kinini.
I had no plans to do so at all	Ntabwo nari mfite gahunda yo kubikora rwose
I have to have faith	Ngomba kugira kwizera
I didn’t know there was anyone outside	Sinari nzi ko hari umuntu uri hanze
I wonder what he meant	Ndabaza icyo yashakaga kuvuga
I need to live again	Nkeneye kongera kubaho
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I think we can win.	Ntekereza ko dushobora gutsinda.
I needed to get out of here	Nari nkeneye kuva hano
I should have done that	Nari nkwiye kubikora
I mean, anyone can do that now	Ndashaka kuvuga ko umuntu wese ashobora kubikora nonaha
I saw this for a while.	Nabonye iki gihe gito.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yamaze kugenda.
I don't have to drink	Ntabwo ngomba kunywa
Here, no.	Hano, ntabwo.
He is a morning person.	Ni umuntu wo mu gitondo.
I can't find anyone	Ntabwo nshobora kubona umuntu
He was right, too.	Na we yari afite ukuri.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
I'm glad he came	Nishimiye ko yaje
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He never had problems.	Ntiyigeze agira ibibazo.
I can't stay in this house	Sinshobora kuguma muri iyi nzu
He has to drink a lot.	Agomba kunywa byinshi.
And we are here now.	Kandi turi hano ubu.
I didn't mean to say anything	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
I don't know what it is or anything	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo cyangwa ikindi
I heard something like.	Numvise ikintu nka.
But he was lucky.	Ariko yagize amahirwe.
He thought of her	Yatekereje kuri we
But if someone wants to help, that's fine.	Ariko niba umuntu ashaka gufasha ibyo nibyiza.
But that doesn't matter.	Ariko ibyo ntacyo.
He did.	Yakoze.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I have to stay here.	Ninjye ugomba kuguma hano.
I know he was your best friend too	Nzi ko nawe yari inshuti yawe nziza
It's us.	Ni twe.
He heard something.	Yumvise ikintu.
You have to have problems for me.	Ugomba kugira ibibazo kuri njye.
Not really good for me.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza kuri njye.
Just a question.	Ikibazo gusa.
Thinking, acting, and hearing.	Gutekereza, gukora, no kumva.
There are many of them.	Hariho byinshi muri byo.
He didn't want to work.	Ntiyashakaga gukora.
I'm glad he didn't	Nishimiye ko atabikoze
I hope we can.	Nizera ko dushobora.
Maybe it's us.	Birashoboka ko ari twe.
The problem now is the truth.	Ikibazo ubu ni ukuri.
Go for everything.	Kujya kuri byose.
I think that's the best thing we can do	Ndakeka ko aribyo byiza dushobora gukora
I did nothing wrong here	Nta kibi nakoze hano
It's in you.	Ni muri wowe.
I can say a lot	Nshobora kuvuga byinshi
Sometimes not always.	Rimwe na rimwe ntabwo buri gihe.
We don't have to.	Ntabwo tugomba.
I really think he does	Ndatekereza rwose ko abikora
It will not be.	Ntabwo bizaba.
He said you were.	Yavuze ko uri.
I knew nothing about him	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi kuri we
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He could see everything, in fact.	Yashoboraga kubona byose, mubyukuri.
I need time to think.	Ndashaka umwanya wo gutekereza.
I had never seen a way to do that	Ntabwo nari nigeze mbona uburyo bwo kubikora
The reason for.	Impamvu ya.
They were one person.	Bari umuntu umwe.
I feel time.	Ndumva umwanya.
I realized that he really meant it	Nabonye ko mubyukuri yashakaga kuvuga
I'm not sure if it's true or not.	Sinzi neza niba ari byo cyangwa atari byo.
I saw it nearby	Nabonye hafi
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
I didn't get the time.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya.
If you want to buy.	Niba ushaka kugura.
I wanted to, however.	Nashakaga, ariko.
He, too, was lucky.	Na we yari afite amahirwe.
I know he will	Nzi ko azabikora
He was not sure if he agreed.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko yemeye.
I don't really like it	Ntabwo nkunda mubyukuri
But it is not money.	Ariko ntabwo ari amafaranga.
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri icyo kibazo
I want to be your friend.	Ndashaka kuba inshuti yawe.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
Learn how.	Kwiga uko byagenze.
Being here.	Kuba hano.
I just want to see my wife	Ndashaka gusa kubona umugore wanjye
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
It was a good idea.	Byari igitekerezo cyiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I have a house here.	Mfite inzu hano.
I needed to hear what I wanted	Nari nkeneye kumva nshaka
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
I love people.	Nkunda abantu.
I should be home a little later	Nkwiye kuba murugo nyuma gato
He got the idea.	Yabonye igitekerezo.
You think.	Uratekereza.
I think she was a girl	Ntekereza ko yari umukobwa
It's a big deal.	Ni ikibazo kinini.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He tried the door.	Yagerageje umuryango.
Very good stuff.	Ibintu byiza cyane.
She is happy to be alone.	Yishimiye kuba wenyine.
He went to find his father.	Yagiye gushaka se.
I hope so	Nizera ko aribyo
I didn't know anyone	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nzi
I didn't know where we were	Ntabwo nari nzi aho twari turi
I know you know the truth	Nzi ko uzi ukuri
He was not worried.	Ntabwo yari afite impungenge.
So far, so good.	Kure cyane, mubyukuri.
I don't think so	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people	Ugomba gutegereza ko agira ibibazo
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We are so many now.	Ubu turi benshi cyane.
People like him	Abantu nka we
But in reality he was about to leave.	Ariko mubyukuri yari agiye kugenda.
But he chose to try again.	Ariko yahisemo kugerageza ikindi gihe.
You saw the children.	Wabonye abana.
It was all about me.	Yari byose kuri njye.
I think that was a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari amakosa.
The child looked like him.	Umwana yasaga na we.
That's what he did.	Nibyo yakoze.
Not that he went to the polls.	Ntabwo ari uko yagiye gushaka ibibazo.
She was his wife.	Yari umugore we.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
Little did I know that it was very difficult	Sinari nzi ko ibyo byari bigoye cyane
I didn't know what he looked like	Sinari nzi uko asa
I have to be me	Ngomba kuba njye
I'm really sorry to hear that	Mbabajwe rwose no kumva ukuri
And you are here.	Kandi uri hano.
We can't find much to eat.	Ntidushobora kubona byinshi byo kurya.
You have to really play.	Ugomba gukina mubyukuri.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
That's not good.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
He had problems.	Yari afite ibibazo.
I needed a friend	Nari nkeneye inshuti
I know this room	Nzi iki cyumba
I shouldn't think too much	Ntabwo nkwiye gutekereza cyane
I can't say enough good things	Sinshobora kuvuga ibintu byiza bihagije
I really need to go	Nkeneye rwose kugenda
Just one thing.	Ikintu gusa.
He will do it when he is ready.	Azabikora igihe azaba yiteguye.
This is a good thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza.
I didn’t need far	Ntabwo nari nkeneye kure
And you can't see them all.	Kandi ntushobora kubona bose.
I never wanted to stay here	Sinigeze nshaka kuguma hano
I think he is a good person.	Ntekereza ko ari umuntu mwiza.
She was beautiful and did well.	Yari mwiza kandi akora neza.
I could be outside doing something	Nshobora kuba hanze nkora ikintu
I just didn't know that	Gusa sinari nzi uko
I was very worried.	Nagize impungenge cyane.
I'm glad they are here.	Nishimiye ko bari hano.
In fact, you can't.	Mubyukuri, ntushobora.
I knew it hadn't been long	Nari nzi ko atari amaze igihe kinini
But none of this today.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri iki gihe.
We don't have to.	Ntabwo tugomba.
I was outside but inside.	Nari hanze ariko imbere.
He may be young.	Ashobora kuba akiri muto.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
That's really good for me.	Nibyiza rwose kuri njye.
We have to.	Tugomba.
It's good that he did it.	Ni byiza kandi ko yabikoze.
You know nothing.	Ntacyo uzi.
I have a lot of luck here	Mfite amahirwe menshi hano
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
I just work hard	Gusa nkora cyane
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
I didn’t want to give up.	Sinifuzaga kureka.
I'm just a person	Ndi umuntu gusa
I need to have what you need	Nkwiye kugira ibyo ukeneye
This is the same.	Ibi ni kimwe.
I was very young at the time	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane
That's what he said.	Ibi ni byo yavuze.
I can see it by myself	Nshobora kubona wenyine
Inside.	Imbere.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I just didn't know	Gusa sinari nzi
Everyone was sitting behind me.	Uyu wese yari yicaye inyuma yanjye.
I can't live	Sinshobora kubaho
But all in all.	Ariko byose mugihe cyiza.
I needed a little time for me	Nari nkeneye umwanya muto kuri njye
It was a good idea.	Byari igitekerezo cyiza.
For me I can’t win.	Kuri njye ntashobora gutsinda.
I find it very good	Njye mbona ari byiza cyane
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I thought about that for a long time	Natekereje kuri ibyo igihe kirekire
I am so happy to be in one of them	Nishimiye cyane kuba muri kimwe muri byo
If so.	Niba aribyo.
Getting help.	Kubona ubufasha.
I just thought about it	Gusa natekereje neza
Everything was going well.	Ibintu byose byari kugenda neza.
I had a wonderful day	Nagize umunsi mwiza cyane
I mean, he’s just not smart	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo afite ubwenge gusa
But it is clear he is not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari we.
I didn't see much	Ntabwo nabonye neza
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
To stop.	Guhagarika.
Obviously you want to be here.	Biragaragara ko ushaka kuba hano.
I know this guy is the right guy	Nzi ko uyu yari umusore ukwiye
And it's not money.	Kandi ntabwo ari amafaranga.
Maybe I'm wrong	Birashoboka ko nta kibi mfite
I was not sure what to do	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora
A lot of money	Amafaranga menshi
We are here.	Turi hano.
It was a day.	Wari umunsi.
I thought it was great	Natekereje ko byari byiza cyane
Where it is.	Aho ari.
Not yet.	Ntabwo kugeza ubu.
I love that you want to do this	Nkunda ko ushaka gukora ibi
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
He said he wanted it too.	Yavuze ko nawe ashaka.
I mean, that’s good	Ndashaka kuvuga, nibyiza
And all that is good.	Kandi ibyo byose ni byiza.
I really hope you can too	Ndizera rwose ko nawe ushobora
He just wanted to.	Yashakaga gusa.
However, this is a much bigger problem.	Ariko, iki kibazo kinini cyane kuruta ibyo.
I don't believe so	Ntabwo nizera ko aribyo
If he was there now, he had something to look forward to.	Niba yari ahari ubu, hari icyo yari yiteze nyuma.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari ko byagenze.
He doesn't know much about anything.	Nta kintu kinini azi ku kintu na kimwe.
I'm sure that	Nzi neza ko ibyo
I didn't hear it all	Ntabwo numvise byose
I was going to try to talk to you again	Nari ngiye kugerageza kongera kuvugana nawe
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
They don't know what happened.	Ntabwo bazi uko byagenze.
You can't find out more.	Ntushobora kumenya byinshi.
It will be great.	Bizaba byiza cyane.
He said no.	Yavuze ko nta.
You are right you want a reason.	Uri ukuri ushaka impamvu.
I knew it from the beginning.	Nari nzi neza kuva mbere.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
I can't drink	Sinshobora kunywa
I can make time	Nshobora gukora igihe
And that's exactly what he did.	Kandi nibyo rwose yakoze.
You didn't get the job right.	Ntabwo wabonye neza akazi.
I am very happy to do so.	Nishimiye cyane kubikora.
I was not really scared	Ntabwo rwose nagize ubwoba
Most likely he did.	Birashoboka cyane ko yabikoze.
I have to try.	Ngomba kugerageza.
He had no plans to go back.	Ntabwo yari afite gahunda yo gusubira inyuma.
You don't have time.	Ntabwo ufite umwanya.
I think a lot of people were	Ntekereza ko abantu benshi bari
I saw the same thing though	Nabonye ikintu kimwe ariko
I just want to be with her all the time	Gusa ndashaka kubana na we igihe cyose
I want time.	Ndashaka igihe.
He never ate or drank before.	Ntabwo yigeze kurya cyangwa kunywa mbere.
I had nothing to take	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo gufata
And, he is right.	Kandi, afite ukuri.
I want to do everything.	Ndashaka gukora byose.
Someone was here.	Umuntu yari hano.
It would be difficult not to do so.	Byaba bigoye kutabikora.
I was going to get food now	Nari ngiye kubona ibiryo nonaha
For more.	Kuri byinshi.
I would do the same thing	Nari gukora ikintu kimwe
Really good to see.	Nibyiza rwose kubona.
I never really understood what he was doing	Sinigeze numva neza icyo yakoze
It was probably his age.	Birashoboka ko yari imyaka ye.
I wanted time away from him	Nashakaga umwanya kure ye
I really want to talk to you	Ndashaka rwose kuvugana nawe
Something you want to see.	Ikintu ushaka kureba.
I guess he's gone now	Ndakeka ko yagiye ubu
Our needs were simple.	Ibyo dukeneye byari byoroshye.
He should not be here, in this room.	Ntagomba kuba hano, muri iki cyumba.
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
Apparently he was.	Biragaragara ko yari.
It’s a very, very good plan.	Ni gahunda nziza cyane kandi nziza.
Everyone was there.	Abantu bose bari aho.
And he wants a baby.	Kandi arashaka umwana.
But it is not my fault	Ariko ntabwo ari amakosa yanjye
It is very clear that this is true.	Biragaragara cyane ko ibyo ari ukuri.
I can't wait.	Ntashobora gutegereza.
He knew he had an idea.	Yari azi ko afite igitekerezo.
He was right.	Yavuze ukuri.
But apparently the girl was something else.	Ariko biragaragara ko umukobwa yari ikindi kintu.
I can't say what you think	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo utekereza
I need to get out of this house	Nkeneye kuva muri iyi nzu
But he did not.	Ariko ntabwo yakoze.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko byari byiza
It's not a movie.	Ntabwo ari firime.
I don't have to think that way	Ntabwo ngomba gutekereza gutya
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
You have to do it now.	Ugomba gukora ubu.
I must be doing something wrong.	Ngomba kuba nkora ikintu kibi.
I can't say for sure	Sinshobora kuvuga neza
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo, birashoboka ko atari byo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He lives here.	Aba hano.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
I was very young at the time	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane
He later found out that he was right.	Nyuma yaje kubona ko afite ukuri.
Well, age was something.	Nibyo, imyaka yari ikintu.
From above.	Kuva hejuru.
When you do that, we have things to do.	Mugihe ukora ibyo, dufite ibintu byo gukora.
I really have to go	Ngomba rwose kugenda
I was close to home	Nari hafi yo murugo
I just enjoyed the time with you	Nishimiye gusa umwanya hamwe nawe
I'm scared for the first time.	Mfite ubwoba bwa mbere.
He started drinking.	Yatangiye kunywa.
I mean, in fact, someone who looks up	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri, umuntu wo kureba hejuru
I don't need much.	Ntabwo nkeneye byinshi.
I guess they're not real people	Ndakeka ko atari abantu mubyukuri
This is a bad time.	Iki ni igihe kibi.
I can't take this anymore	Sinshobora kongera gufata ibi
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I can't go that far	Sinshobora kugenda gutya
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I saw something else though	Nabonye ikindi kintu ariko
I feel ashamed of him	Numva mfite isoni hafi ye
It was difficult to drive from here.	Byari bigoye gutwara imodoka kuva aha.
Try harder.	Kugerageza cyane.
Until recently.	Kugeza vuba aha.
I didn't know why.	Sinari nzi impamvu.
I hope he wanted to help	Ndizera ko yashakaga gufasha
I feel like mistakes can happen	Ndumva amakosa ashobora kubaho
I didn't know what the problem was	Sinari nzi ikibazo icyo ari cyo
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
I should go	Nkwiye kugenda
It's just a dog.	Ni imbwa gusa.
I can't go back now.	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
I needed to find my family	Nari nkeneye gushaka umuryango wanjye
And not just once.	Kandi si rimwe gusa.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I knew nothing about him	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi kuri we
And you need it, and you can learn to do it right.	Kandi ukeneye, kandi urashobora kwiga kubikora neza.
I didn’t have much to do	Ntabwo nari mfite byinshi byo gukora
I think it worked for everyone	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza kuri buri wese
And, there is something else.	Kandi, hariho ikindi kintu.
He must have time.	Agomba kugira umwanya.
We have to stop that.	Tugomba guhagarika ibyo.
He was a young man.	Yari umuntu muto.
I thought you were my wife	Natekereje ko uri umugore wanjye
And that was the day.	Kandi uwo wari umunsi.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
In his house.	Mu nzu ye.
People he loved.	Abantu yakundaga.
I understand what he meant.	Ndumva icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I'm really glad he left	Nishimiye rwose kubona yagiye
I was well aware, however	Nari nzi neza, ariko
But he was not going to give up.	Ariko ntiyari agiye kureka.
I can't figure out why	Sinshobora kumenya impamvu
I just didn't know how to do it	Gusa sinari nzi kubikora
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
That's all for us today.	Ibyo aribyo byose kuri twe uyumunsi.
He can play.	Arashobora gukina.
You don’t have to do all this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi byose.
I wanted to see.	Nashakaga kureba.
He was going to apply.	Yari agiye gusaba.
I just wanted to.	Nashakaga gusa.
He probably doesn't hear anything.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo yumva.
A little thing	Ikintu gito
It will not be for us.	Ntabwo bizaba kuri twe.
You don't have to tell anyone.	Ntugomba kubwira umuntu.
That is another problem.	Icyo ni ikindi kibazo.
In front of you.	Imbere yawe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu gito gusa.
I need to know what he told me	Ngomba kumenya icyo yambwiye
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo.
I imagine what he does when he is alone	Ndatekereza ibyo akora iyo ari wenyine
I like normal things sometimes	Nkunda ibintu bisanzwe rimwe na rimwe
I didn't know why.	Sinari nzi impamvu.
He seems to be doing well.	Asa naho akora neza.
I want to study	Ndashaka kwiga
There is not much to catch.	Nta byinshi byo gufata.
They are all the same thing.	Bose ni ikintu kimwe.
I didn't know what a guy looked like	Ntabwo nari nzi uko umusore asa
he says	avuga
Getting good food.	Kubona ibiryo byiza.
He is on top.	Ari hejuru.
He didn't deserve it.	Ntabwo yari akwiye.
He says stop thinking.	Avuga ko reka kureka gutekereza.
I know what you like	Nzi ibyo ukunda
I know a lot of them	Nzi byinshi muri byo
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
It was a beautiful house tonight.	Byari inzu nziza muri iri joro.
I have good friends	Mfite inshuti nziza
It wouldn’t be a bad buy.	Ntabwo byari kugura nabi.
Smart guy	Umusore ufite ubwenge.
I know what he is saying.	Nzi ibyo avuga.
I think it was good	Ndakeka ko byari byiza
That's right.	Nukuri.
The child was never scared.	Umwana ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
Nice to meet you.	Nishimiye kubana nawe.
He is reading a lot.	Arimo gusoma byinshi.
I have to do something.	Ngomba gukora ikintu.
He said that was why he was here.	Yavuze ko ari yo mpamvu yari hano.
At the time, they were right.	Icyo gihe, bari bafite ukuri.
I'm not sure what that is	Sinzi neza icyo aricyo
You can see almost anything.	Urashobora kubona hafi ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
I never got to where you are or what to do	Ntabwo nigeze aho uri cyangwa icyo gukora
I need to learn how.	Nkeneye kwiga uburyo.
He was young.	Yari muto.
And he was not there before.	Kandi ntiyari ahari mbere.
A player can do this only once	Umukinnyi arashobora kubikora rimwe gusa
I know what he meant.	Nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
Same every day.	Buri munsi kimwe.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
I may have a problem	Nshobora kugira ikibazo
That would be us.	Ibyo byaba ari twe.
I can't think of a better way to do it.	Sinshobora gutekereza kubikora.
I have to go	Ngomba kugenda
This is her first child.	Uyu ni umwana we wa mbere.
That is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibintu.
he says.	avuga.
I didn’t want to take it	Ntabwo nashakaga gufata
In front of me.	Imbere yanjye.
I thought that was the case at the time	Natekerezaga ko icyo gihe ari ukuri
I need that.	Nkeneye ibyo.
It's a good idea to have friends.	Ni ikintu cyiza kugira inshuti.
I don’t really think they would even take the time.	Ntabwo rwose ntekereza ko bari no gufata umwanya.
I can't figure out what it is	Sinshobora kumenya icyo aricyo
I should know better than to try now.	Nkwiye kumenya neza kuruta kugerageza nonaha.
I want to go see the house	Ndashaka kujya kureba inzu
I can read	Nshobora kubona gusoma
It was always good.	Buri gihe byari byiza.
I was going to drink	Nari ngiye kunywa
He told me once.	Yambwiye rimwe.
To see	Kubona.
He wanted to, he was there.	Yashakaga, yari ahari.
I want to play every week.	Ndashaka gukina buri cyumweru.
I should have been here for him	Nari nkwiye kuba hano kuri we
The best thing you can do.	Ikintu cyiza ushobora gukora.
He could have done it now.	Yashoboraga kubikora ubu.
I am not human.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu.
I can't think	Sinshobora gutekereza
I want to do it all again	Ndashaka kongera kubikora byose
I didn’t know about all this	Ntabwo nari nzi kuri ibi byose
I guess so.	Ndakeka yuko.
I needed to make new friends	Nari nkeneye gushaka inshuti nshya
I don’t trust people	Ntabwo nizera abantu
I know people for that	Nzi abantu kubyo byoroshye
Absolutely not good.	Rwose ntabwo byari byiza.
I figured you had to stay	Nabonye ko ugomba kuguma
Once.	Rimwe.
We all.	Natwe twese.
I want to go	Ndashaka kugenda
And another, another.	Kandi ikindi, ikindi.
All together	Twese hamwe.
I needed to go	Nari nkeneye kugenda
I have a lot of money	Mfite amafaranga menshi
I'm sure that's the case	Nzi neza ko ibyo aribyo
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I thought.	Ndatekereza.
No one said he looked good.	Nta muntu wavuze ko asa neza.
He must not say or do anything.	Ntabwo agomba kuvuga cyangwa gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I was so beautiful alone.	Nari mwiza cyane wenyine.
We are where we are.	Turi aho turi.
My dog ​​is home alone.	Imbwa yanjye iri murugo wenyine.
You don’t even have to do it very well.	Ntugomba no kubikora neza cyane.
It’s an idea we have problems with.	Ni igitekerezo dufite ibibazo.
I was not sure what that was, but it was true	Sinari nzi neza icyo, ariko byari ukuri
I know you have to go	Nzi ko ugomba kugenda
I have to try.	Ngomba kugerageza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But that's fine now.	Ariko ibyo nibyiza nonaha.
I guess he shouldn't	Ndakeka ko atagomba
Maybe tomorrow he will be alone.	Birashoboka ko ejo azaba wenyine.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko aribyo.
I really don't need money	Ntabwo nkeneye rwose amafaranga
It was great today.	Uyu munsi byari byiza rwose.
I'm not sure where they are.	Sinzi neza aho bari.
By now you have to have everything.	Kugeza ubu ugomba kuba ufite byose.
I wanted to be here	Nari nashakaga kuba hano
He has advice.	Afite inama.
He had not asked for a driver.	Ntabwo yari yasabye gutwara.
I have never been able to live in that	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kubaho muri ibyo
','.	','.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
Really nice family	Umuryango mwiza rwose
At all times	Igihe cyose.
I can't think straight	Sinshobora gutekereza neza
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
I want to know why	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu
He always tried.	Yagerageje buri gihe.
Looking at everything.	Kureba kuri buri kintu.
I wanted to do it	Nari nshaka kubikora
I think that's what he wanted.	Ntekereza ko aricyo yashakaga.
Everyone did things.	Umuntu wese yakoze ibintu.
Friends are right.	Inshuti nibyo.
I don't know who he is or anything	Ntabwo nzi uwo ari we cyangwa ikindi
It was really good for me.	Byari byiza rwose kuri njye.
I want to hear something	Ndashaka kumva ikintu
I needed a family	Nari nkeneye umuryango
I like to read.	Nkunda gusoma.
I know what you mean	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga
And look carefully.	Kandi kureba neza.
Not at this time.	Ntabwo ari iki gihe.
He knew it was a bad day.	Yari azi ko ari umunsi mubi.
I hope we can do it right.	Nizera ko dushobora kubikora neza.
I was just a man.	Nari umuntu gusa.
Everything was going wrong.	Ibintu byose byari byagenze nabi.
Where you want	Aho ushaka.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
I just need a little time to think	Nkeneye gusa umwanya muto wo gutekereza
He wanted to be here.	Yashakaga hano.
I never saw him go.	Sinigeze mbona na we agenda.
You have to give up.	Ugomba kureka.
They knew everything for everyone.	Bari bazi byose kuri buri wese.
He went like this.	Yagiye gutya.
I wanted to do it wrong	Nashakaga kubikora nabi
I really want to know who he is	Ndashaka rwose kumenya uwo ari we
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
I know nothing	Ntacyo nzi na gato
I didn't know how to do it	Sinari nzi uburyo bwo kubikora
I did not want to drink again	Sinifuzaga kongera kunywa
I was not a very thoughtful child	Ntabwo nari umwana utekereza cyane
He is only three years old.	Afite imyaka itatu gusa.
I didn’t want to talk about this	Sinifuzaga kuvuga kuri ibi
I can't see.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona.
Young woman, she didn't look like me	Umugore muto, ntabwo yasaga nkanjye
It's your money.	Ni amafaranga yawe.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
Eventually he won	Amaherezo yaje gutsinda
I can't figure out when to live	Sinshobora kumenya igihe agomba kubaho
What did you see there ?.	Ni iki wabonye aho?.
He did not know what it was.	Ntiyari azi icyo ari cyo.
I have.	Mfite.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I've seen a lot of things, just like you	Nabonye ibintu byinshi, kimwe nawe
And it's good to be good.	Kandi nibyiza kuba byiza.
In the end it worked.	Amaherezo byagenze neza.
I want to come	Ndashaka kuza
He tried well.	Yagerageje neza.
I also had no friends	Nanjye sinari mfite inshuti
Nothing for me.	Ntacyo kuri njye.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
I think we need to talk about time	Ndakeka ko dukeneye kuvuga igihe
I have to do everything right again	Ngomba kongera gukora ibintu byose neza
To live a little, just once.	Kubaho gato, rimwe gusa.
I have the same problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe
Please let me go.	Nyamuneka reka reka.
I really shouldn’t have too many problems	Ntabwo rwose nkwiye kugira ibibazo byinshi
We are many.	Turi benshi.
Living tomorrow, not today.	Kubaho ejo, ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
The little girl, it was	Umukobwa muto, byari
He would know people.	Yari kumenya abantu.
I wanted to get out of here	Nashakaga kuva aha
That you need to do it and you have to stay longer.	Ko ukeneye kubikora kandi ugomba kuguma igihe kirekire.
I desperately needed help	Nashakaga cyane ubufasha
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
But we can't stay.	Ariko ntidushobora kuguma.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I have to live one day at a time	Ngomba kubaho umunsi umwe umwe
This was a house.	Iyi yari inzu.
I really didn’t get the time to look	Ntabwo rwose nabonye umwanya wo kureba
I was so scared to make friends	Nagize ubwoba cyane kubona inshuti
Someone was outside.	Umuntu yari hanze.
This is not very good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
.	.
He chose.	Yahisemo.
I had a lot to think about	Nari mfite byinshi byo gutekereza
Lots.	Byinshi.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
He is lucky.	Afite amahirwe.
I wonder if that is the case	Ndabaza niba aribyo
I can't be away from you	Sinshobora kuba kure yawe
I love that good, really	Nkunda ibyo byiza, mubyukuri
He took the money.	Yafashe amafaranga.
I really wanted a girl	Nashakaga rwose umukobwa
I wanted to be beautiful.	Nashakaga kuba mwiza.
I knew it was wrong	Nari nzi ko atari byo
I mean, that’s not it.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo aribyo.
Whatever you need to win, you have.	Ikintu cyose ukeneye gutsinda, ufite.
There was something else he wanted.	Hariho ikindi kintu yashakaga.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
But I can't do that.	Ariko sinshobora kubikora.
It would be great !.	Byaba byiza!.
I guess so.	Ndakeka ko aribyo.
We can never say.	Ntabwo dushobora kuvuga na rimwe.
I just saw something	Nabonye ikintu gusa
And he wanted to be.	Kandi yashakaga kuba.
One time.	Umwanya umwe.
I didn't want to go to my house	Sinifuzaga kujya mu nzu yanjye
But he was ready to go.	Ariko yari yiteguye kugenda.
I knew that from the beginning	Nari nzi ko kuva mbere
Maybe that will happen one day.	Ahari ibyo bizaba umunsi umwe.
You can do it now.	Urashobora kubikora nonaha.
He says he doesn't know what to do.	Avuga ko atazi icyo akora.
I was very close	Nari hafi cyane
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari amakosa.
No phone.	Nta terefone.
I really don't know	Ntacyo nzi rwose
In his house.	Mu nzu ye.
We.	We.
She was also very nice.	Na we yari mwiza cyane.
He just did it.	Yabikoze gusa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I'm here if you need anything.	Ndi hano niba hari icyo ukeneye.
I thought about this a little.	Natekereje kuri ibi gato.
He was in front of me.	Yari imbere yanjye.
I don't like it at all	Ntabwo nkunda gato
At that point, he decided to go home.	Icyo gihe, yahisemo gutaha.
Eventually, he came to her.	Amaherezo, yaje kuri we.
That was great.	Iyo yari nziza cyane.
I want to be with you always	Ndashaka kubana nawe buri gihe
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Now we have to go and do it.	Ubu tugomba kujya kubikora.
Ask for help.	Gusaba ubufasha.
But there is something you need to know.	Ariko hari ikintu ugomba kumenya.
I don't know what it is but it looks good.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo ariko birasa neza.
That what everyone does.	Ko ibyo buri wese akora.
It was not time.	Ntiyari igihe.
Sometimes it is true.	Rimwe na rimwe ni ukuri.
In fact, it is.	Mubyukuri, nibyo.
I am a woman.	Ndi umugore.
You know if you are.	Uzi niba uri.
I need one of those	Nkeneye kimwe muri ibyo
I was just behind him	Nari inyuma ye gusa
I want him to tell the truth	Ndashaka ko avuga ukuri
I never saw anyone.	Nta muntu nigeze mbona.
I thought so.	Natekerezaga ko.
I thought it was great	Natekereje ko ari nziza cyane
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kureba hanze.
I have found what to do so far.	Nabonye ibyo gukora kugeza ubu.
I'm not going to be	Ntabwo ngiye kuba
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari birashoboka.
He was not looking for anyone.	Ntabwo yashakaga umuntu.
I really want to help	Ndashaka rwose gufasha
He needed to do it.	Yari akeneye kubikora.
I noticed that he did it before.	Nabonye ko yabikoze mbere.
I was just thinking about work	Natekerezaga gusa ku kazi
I see nothing	Ntacyo mbona
They were not many.	Ntabwo bari benshi.
I think we can do that	Ntekereza ko dushobora kubikora
We can't play too much, we can't try too hard.	Ntidushobora gukina cyane, ntidushobora kugerageza cyane.
It is not difficult to see that this is possible.	Ntabwo bigoye kubona ko ibyo bishoboka.
You never did.	Ntabwo wigeze ukora.
Not tonight, but soon.	Ntabwo ari iri joro, ariko vuba.
He has a book.	Afite igitabo.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
And, easy and good.	Kandi, byoroshye nibyiza.
I'm sure it happened	Nzi neza ko byagenze
But he did not know for sure.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza.
Soon.	Vuba.
He was young !.	Yari muto muto!.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I need to see my baby	Nkeneye kubona umwana wanjye
You could do anything you want.	Wari gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose ushaka.
I was not sure what to do	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora
I hope you like staying here.	Nizere ko ukunda kuguma hano.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I know why you did it	Nzi impamvu wabikoze
But he did not take this one.	Ariko ntabwo yafashe iyi.
He must have time.	Agomba kugira umwanya.
I was scared.	Nari mfite ubwoba.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
At the time, it was not.	Icyo gihe, ntabwo byari.
You can, too.	Urashobora, nawe.
You have to do something.	Ugomba kugira icyo ukora.
I'm going to help.	Ngiye gufasha.
I had good things to do	Nari mfite ibintu byiza byo gukora
Or he knows who he is.	Cyangwa azi uwo ari we.
You may want to look at that.	Urashobora gushaka kureba kuri ibyo.
I never saw that	Sinigeze mbona ibyo
This will be fine.	Ibi bizaba byiza.
Chances are? 	Amahirwe?
I know you know who he is, what he is.	Nzi ko uzi uwo ari we, icyo ari cyo.
maybe	birashoboka.
Not as usual.	Ntabwo ari nkuko byari bisanzwe.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
What he expected.	Ibyo yari yiteze.
I really saw this.	Nabonye ibi rwose.
But many things are clear.	Ariko ibintu byinshi biragaragara.
I was not good at all	Ntabwo nari mwiza na gato
I was too.	Nanjye nari.
They all had a school.	Bose bari bafite ishuri.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nawe.
I wanted to do something	Nashakaga gukora ikintu
I think that's true	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri
But he was here.	Ariko yari hano.
We don't have to go far.	Ntabwo tugomba kujya kure.
But it is not a plan.	Ariko ntabwo ari gahunda.
He was a better person than he knew.	Yari umuntu mwiza kuruta uwo yari azi.
I didn't know how to do it	Sinari nzi kubikora
He can play.	Arashobora gukina.
Reka.	Reka.
I hope everyone is.	Ndizera ko buri wese ari.
I was not sure what he was doing here	Sinari nzi neza icyo yari hano gukora
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
I just hope you know what to do	Gusa nizere ko uzi icyo gukora
You have to learn to take it alone.	Ugomba kwiga gufata ya wenyine.
I want to be who you want me to be	Ndashaka kuba uwo ushaka ko ndi
I can and should do something	Nshobora kugira kandi ngomba gukora ikintu
What he said was true.	Ibyo yavuze byari ukuri.
You don't know exactly what to do with it.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo gukora muri ibyo.
I know what it is.	Nzi icyo aricyo.
He should not have gone.	Ntiyari akwiye kugenda.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He had good things.	Yari afite ibintu byiza.
We have nothing now.	Ntacyo dufite ubu.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
It is not a school.	Ntabwo ari ishuri.
However, this is not likely to be the case.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo bishoboka ko aribyo.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
I can't go.	Sinshobora kugenda.
You are lucky.	Ufite amahirwe yawe.
Too much walking.	Kugenda cyane.
This is not the case now.	Ubu ntabwo ari ikintu.
He has nothing.	Nta na kimwe afite.
I really wanted to	Nashakaga cyane
For us, this is it.	Kuri twe, iyi ni yo.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Who?	Ninde?.
He was not, but he was.	Ntabwo yari, ariko yari.
I need something to do	Nkeneye ikintu cyo gukora
It is not my fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yanjye.
I didn't know what else to do.	Sinari nzi ikindi gukora.
The young man seemed to be good enough.	Umusore yasaga nkaho ari mwiza bihagije.
You need help together.	Ukeneye ubufasha hamwe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He can't be alone.	Ntashobora kuba wenyine.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
What did he say?	Yavuze iki?
I can't talk to him	Sinshobora kuvugana na we
Not recently.	Ntabwo ari vuba aha.
It's a Problem.	Ni Ikibazo.
We really have a problem.	Dufite rwose ikibazo.
I didn’t want him to go	Sinifuzaga ko agenda
I was not sure if that was possible	Sinari nzi neza niba ibyo bishoboka
At the time, that was not the case.	Icyo gihe ntabwo byari ukuri.
I never saw people.	Sinigeze mbona abantu.
You can drive.	Urashobora gutwara.
But he was there.	Ariko yari ahari.
He tried once.	Yagerageje rimwe.
There are not many opportunities.	Ntabwo amahirwe menshi ahari.
I'm glad he came.	Nishimiye ko yaje.
He is one of us.	Ni umwe muri twe.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
I know what it is now.	Nzi icyo aricyo ubu.
I wanted to be above and beyond.	Nashakaga kuba hejuru no kure.
This learning process, in fact, is a lot.	Iyi gahunda yo kwiga, mubyukuri, ni byinshi.
Always	Buri gihe.
He is.	Niwe.
He knows the truth.	Azi ukuri.
It's a job.	Ni akazi.
I have to give up.	Ngomba kureka.
But the food was good.	Ariko ibiryo byari byiza.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
He was just one child and it was very easy.	Yari umwana umwe gusa kandi byari byoroshye cyane.
I felt very ashamed	Numvise mfite isoni cyane
You can find the problem here.	Urashobora kubona ikibazo hano.
He is what we need.	Niwe dukeneye.
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
You have nothing now.	Nta na kimwe ufite ubu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I'm glad he did	Nishimiye ko yabikoze
He would see nothing.	Nta kintu yari kubona.
No one has ever done that before.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora mbere.
I need a little time.	Nkeneye igihe gito.
.	.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko yabikoze.
But I heard nothing.	Ariko nta kintu numvise.
It will not be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza.
Of these, however, later.	Muri ibyo ariko, nyuma.
I really am.	Nukuri ndi.
He is about to give up, almost to retreat.	Ari hafi kureka, hafi yo gusubira inyuma.
He was not afraid of it.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba kuri byo.
You are scared.	Ufite ubwoba.
I feel scared.	Numva ubwoba.
But sometimes.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe.
I just thought you were beautiful	Natekerezaga gusa ko uri mwiza
It's best if you have to go.	Nibyiza niba ugomba kugenda.
I should have done something else	Nari nkwiye gukora ikindi kintu
I thought it was really good.	Natekereje ko byari byiza rwose.
It was easy to see	Nari byoroshye kubona
Me, guy.	Njye, umusore.
I want one.	Ndashaka umwe.
I know what he means.	Nzi icyo ashaka kuvuga.
But he was right.	Ariko yari afite ukuri.
I didn't really need to hear	Sinari nkeneye rwose kumva
My child can do it.	Umwana wanjye arashobora kubikora.
I had no house or house	Nta nzu cyangwa inzu nari mfite
It is not an easy task	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye
What he said was true.	Ibyo yari yavuze byari ukuri.
But this is not what you want.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo ushaka.
I can go home soon.	Nshobora gutaha vuba.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I have to go ahead	Ngomba kujya imbere
Playing time.	Gukina igihe.
But he never felt good.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze yumva ko ari byiza.
This is not difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye.
No one was in front of him.	Nta muntu wari imbere ye.
It was not possible	Ntabwo byari bishoboka
You don't have to read.	Ntugomba gusoma.
What your son did once, he can do again.	Ibyo umuhungu wawe yakoze rimwe, arashobora kongera gukora.
I know what to do	Nzi icyo tugomba gukora
I hope not	Ndizera ko atari byo
Did you know they are here.	Wari uziko bari hano.
I have a little girl	Mfite umukobwa muto
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Nashakaga kumenya icyo atekereza
I'm not going to do that	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora
To eat	Kujya kurya.
The food was simple and easy.	Ibiryo byari byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
He will be ready to go.	Azaba yiteguye kugenda.
That was absolutely true.	Ibyo byari ukuri rwose.
He wants to go to school	Arashaka kujya ku ishuri
I knew there were people	Nari nzi ko hari abantu
I wanted to have.	Nashakaga kugira.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
He would really feel bad.	Nukuri yari kumva nabi.
He could have done anything, but this.	Yashoboraga gukora ikintu cyose, ariko ibi.
I was going to do it	Nari ngiye kubikora
I can't wait to read more from you.	Sinshobora gutegereza gusoma byinshi kure yawe.
I'm going to.	Ngiye ku.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
The only problem was that he was very happy to eat.	Gusa ikibazo nuko yishimiye cyane kurya.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
Being there, you did it.	Kuba ahari, wabikoze.
And it was.	Kandi byari.
We need work.	Dukeneye akazi.
That's exactly what you have.	Nibyo rwose ufite.
Before he leaves.	Mbere yuko agenda.
Until then.	Kugeza icyo gihe.
I never heard of anything	Sinigeze numva ikintu na kimwe
Maybe he has something to say now.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo agomba kuvuga ubu.
He seems to have a lot of luck.	Asa nkaho afite amahirwe menshi.
If you can play, you can play.	Niba ushobora gukina, urashobora gukina.
I wanted to hear everything	Nashakaga kumva byose
And he went after his father.	Kandi yagiye inyuma ya se.
I mean, there was a time	Ndashaka kuvuga, hari igihe yari
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
You are lucky.	Ufite amahirwe.
I know you can do better.	Nzi ko ushobora gukora neza.
You have to do it another time.	Ugomba kubikora ikindi gihe.
We now have the opportunity to travel.	Ubu dufite amahirwe yo kugenda.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I thought about everything he said	Natekereje kubyo yavuze byose
They had nothing bad to say.	Nta kintu kibi bari bafite cyo kuvuga.
He was very skilled.	Yari umuhanga cyane.
Someone like me	Umuntu nkanjye.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I think he is right.	Ndakeka ko afite ukuri.
I know what to do	Nzi icyo tugomba gukora
He is leaving.	Arimo kugenda.
But that was it.	Ariko ibyo byari byo.
I can see that	Nshobora kubona iyo
Everything is a chance.	Ibintu byose ni amahirwe.
She wants to help.	Ashaka gufasha.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
I needed to do it	Nari nkeneye kubikora
This was difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye.
He is a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza.
I feel like a gift.	Numva ari impano.
It finally came.	Amaherezo yaje.
He was doing well.	Yari akora neza.
I'm sure of that	Nzi neza ko kuri ibyo
I am inside him, in him.	Ndi imbere muri we, muri we.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
There are many reasons.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi.
This is good.	Iyi ni nziza.
He had no reason to tell me what he knew.	Nta mpamvu yari afite yo kumbwira ibyo yari azi.
Inside there is another room.	Imbere hari ikindi cyumba.
I love everything he does.	Nkunda ibyo akora byose.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
For more.	Kuri byinshi.
But he was not there.	Ariko ntabwo yari ahari.
I really enjoyed talking to you on the phone	Nishimiye cyane kuvugana nawe kuri terefone
I hope you did	Nizere ko wabikoze
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
I believe, he is one person	Ndizera, ni umuntu umwe
A true woman.	Umugore nukuri.
I can't.	Sinshobora.
Time is short.	Igihe ni gito.
It's a party.	Ni ibirori.
For now, he has to think.	Kuri ubu, agomba gutekereza.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
He never had.	Ntiyigeze agira.
I thought he told me everything he knew	Natekereje ko yambwiye ibyo azi byose
She is beautiful.	Ari mwiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I don't want a wife.	Ntabwo nshaka umugore.
He had an idea.	Yari afite igitekerezo.
I knew exactly what he was going to say	Nari nzi neza icyo agiye kuvuga
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nanjye
I can never stay too far from you	Sinshobora na rimwe kuguma kure yawe cyane
But there is something else, something good.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu, ikintu cyiza.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri.
He was not in this world.	Ntiyari kuri iyi si.
I love this house.	Nkunda iyi nzu.
This will be the same.	Ibi bizaba kimwe.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
It looks like.	Birasa nkaho.
I feel they are in me.	Ndumva bari muri njye.
Maybe you want to do it.	Birashoboka ko ushaka kubikora.
We have tomorrow.	Dufite ejo.
I needed to get out of here	Nari nkeneye kuva hano
I just feel better.	Gusa ndumva aribyo byiza.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
This house is beautiful.	Iyi nzu nziza.
I can't even think straight	Sinshobora no gutekereza neza
I didn't want to do that	Ntabwo nashakaga kubikora
I like to do this.	Nkunda gukora ibi.
I need help.	Nkeneye ubufasha.
I have to go do something.	Ngomba kujya gukora ikintu.
I found this difficult	Nabonye ibi bigoye
I think that was great	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari byiza cyane
You can actually see it	Urashobora kubona mubyukuri
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
I can't go to jail	Sinshobora kujya muri gereza
I thought you were good at this	Natekerezaga ko uri mwiza kuri ibi
Since then, I have been in your house.	Kuva icyo gihe, ndi mu nzu yawe.
You want to talk to me now.	Ushaka kuvugana nawe nonaha.
However, it may not be you or me.	Ariko, birashoboka ko atari wowe cyangwa njye.
And that’s not all we had.	Kandi si ibyo twari dufite gusa.
But in reality, that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
You were at work.	Wari ku kazi.
Everything was going well.	Byose byari byagenze neza.
It was great to do this.	Byari byiza cyane gukora ibi.
He has an opinion on everything.	Afite igitekerezo kuri buri kintu.
I knew exactly what was going on	Nari nzi neza uko byagenze
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was always around me and I was the only one.	Buri gihe byari hafi yanjye kandi ni njye wenyine.
It's a small thing.	Ni ikintu gito.
But he is the one to watch.	Ariko niwe ugomba kureba.
I saw and heard nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye kandi numva.
Both together, in my house.	Bombi hamwe, mu nzu yanjye.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
You can do the same.	Urashobora nawe kubikora.
He wanted everything else.	Yashakaga ikindi kintu cyose.
There is more to it.	Hariho byinshi kuri byo.
I mean, maybe he has, maybe	Ndashaka kuvuga, yaba afite, birashoboka
I just want to do it	Gusa ndashaka kubikora
I have simple questions that are.	Mfite ibibazo byoroshye aribyo.
I may be lucky one day	Nshobora kugira amahirwe umunsi umwe
Everyone is good enough in that.	Umuntu wese ni mwiza bihagije muri byo.
Quit that plan.	Kureka iyo gahunda.
I also had a job	Nanjye nari mfite akazi
It would be nice if anyone could help.	Byaba byiza umuntu wese ashobora gufasha.
I think about the problem	Ntekereza ku kibazo
I just knew he was	Nari nzi gusa ko ari we
Doing more.	Gukora byinshi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I was just wondering what he might be thinking	Natekerezaga gusa icyo ashobora kuba atekereza
Stop that thing.	Reka icyo kintu.
He is here to stay.	Ari hano kuguma.
He is not alone here.	Ntabwo ari hano wenyine wenyine.
It looks so good.	Birasa neza cyane.
I’m sure he has a lot of plans for me	Nzi neza ko afite gahunda nyinshi kuri njye
I hope to work hard	Nizera gukora cyane
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
I can't take anything.	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ikintu na kimwe.
But he was just one person.	Ariko yari umuntu umwe gusa.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
Being human is not human.	Kuba umuntu ntabwo ari umuntu.
There is one small problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gito.
He goes alone.	Agenda wenyine.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
I feel reluctant	Ndumva adashaka
Never before me.	Nta na rimwe imbere yanjye.
Maybe for us.	Ahari kuri twe.
He wants out.	Ashaka hanze.
About him.	Hafi ye.
I can go back to school	Nshobora gusubira ku ishuri
The interior was not very good.	Ntabwo imbere byari byiza cyane.
Sunday to Sunday	Kuva ku cyumweru kugeza ku cyumweru.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
Whoever it is is the right person to do it.	Uwo yaba ari umuntu ukwiye kubikora.
We don't need to go into that.	Ntabwo dukeneye kujya muri ibyo.
He was the only person.	Yari umuntu wenyine wenyine.
That's you	Uwo ni wowe.
We all have things we can talk to.	Twese dufite ibintu dushobora kuvugana numuntu.
You have to stay.	Ugomba kuguma.
No father.	Nta se.
I was sure she was beautiful	Nari nzi neza ko ari mwiza
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari.
You can't tell if it's true or not.	Ntushobora kumenya niba ari byo cyangwa atari byo.
He had nothing to do with the film.	Ntacyo yari afite cyo gukora iyi firime.
A woman loves a woman	Umugore akunda umugore
I want to say more.	Ndashaka kuvuga byinshi.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
I appreciate the advice.	Nishimiye inama.
I saw a lot in me	Nabonye byinshi muri njye
She wants to be together.	Ashaka kubana.
I don’t know why, really.	Sinzi impamvu, mubyukuri.
I thought it was good for him.	Natekereje ko byari byiza kuri we.
I didn't know what to think	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza
And so far it has been true.	Kandi kugeza ubu byari ukuri.
I want to be a teacher	Ndashaka kuba umwarimu
He knew he had to talk to someone about it.	Yari azi ko agomba kuvugana numuntu kuri ibyo.
I can figure out what it is.	Nshobora kumenya icyo aricyo.
I didn't know that hair could smell	Sinari nzi ko umusatsi ushobora kumva
He knew who he was.	Yari azi uwo ari we.
But there is.	Ariko hariho.
That would be enough.	Ibyo byaba bihagije.
I shouldn't have done this	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gukora ibi
I didn't think much of that	Ntabwo natekereje kurenza ibyo
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
But what he was about to see would not be good.	Ariko ibyo yari agiye kubona ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
I like simple things	Nkunda ibintu byoroshye
I am very happy with what happened	Nishimiye cyane uko byagenze
I should have had my phone	Nari nkwiye kugira terefone yanjye
He was not going to do it.	Ntabwo yari agiye kubikora.
We have a lot of problems here.	Dufite ibibazo byinshi hano.
The same thing.	Icyo kintu kimwe.
I doubt that is the case.	Ndashidikanya ko aribyo.
I can do better, be better.	Nshobora gukora neza, kuba mwiza.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari mwiza.
I was down, swimming	Nari hasi, koga koga
I thought he was an expert	Natekerezaga ko yari umuhanga
I guess you look good	Ndakeka ko usa neza
He got it right	Yabonye neza
I don’t want to win like that.	Sinshaka gutsinda gutya.
No one knew where you were.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho uri.
Inside and out.	Ni imbere kandi no hanze.
I just have a little problem.	Mfite ikibazo gito gusa.
I was just scared	Nagize ubwoba gusa
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
You don't think about the movie.	Ntacyo utekereza kuri firime.
I didn't see or hear anything	Nta kintu na kimwe nabonye cyangwa numvise
I didn’t know he was so young.	Sinari nzi ko ari muto cyane.
I always think.	Ntekereza kuri buri gihe.
I knew he was a good person	Nari nzi ko ari umuntu mwiza
I have absolutely nothing	Ntacyo mfite rwose
She is just beautiful and loves to help.	Ni mwiza gusa kandi akunda gufasha.
I'm doing it.	Ndimo kubikora.
So much for me.	Byinshi kuri njye.
I thought about all that	Natekerezaga kuri ibyo byose
I mean, you can actually do that.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri urashobora kubikora.
Everyone wants a lot of money too.	Umuntu wese arashaka amafaranga menshi kandi.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
I didn't need to.	Sinari nkeneye.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
He can do it.	Arashobora kubikora.
He may see again.	Arashobora kongera kubona.
This time.	Iki gihe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
This is not difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye.
He knows he made a mistake.	Azi ko yakoze amakosa.
All in all, it was great.	Byose, byari byiza.
Or most of all.	Cyangwa byinshi muri byose.
I want to do good things.	Ndashaka gukora ibintu byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari.
I just see and hear, that's all	Gusa mbona kubona no kumva, nibyo byose
I was terrified very quickly.	Nagize ubwoba vuba vuba.
I want to go back to that	Ndashaka gusubira kuri ibyo
Tell your dog to find someone.	Bwira imbwa yawe gushaka umuntu.
Everyone was there.	Abantu bose bari aho.
I was really bad	Nari mubi rwose
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
'	'
The truth was not.	Ukuri ntabwo yari.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
And it's easy to do.	Kandi byoroshye gukora.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I believe he was right.	Nizera ko yari afite ukuri.
I like to be at home	Nkunda kuba murugo
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
Nice to meet you	Nishimiye kubana nawe
Apparently he went.	Biragaragara ko yagiye.
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri icyo kibazo
I don’t have to go back	Ntabwo ngomba gusubira inyuma
I'm going to try this.	Ngiye kugerageza ibi.
You’ve got to do a lot of things.	Wabonye gukora ibintu byinshi.
I didn't want to know.	Sinifuzaga kumenya.
He didn't have to do it.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubikora.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva nabi kuvuga cyane.
I need to be here with you.	Nkeneye kuba hano hamwe nawe.
House.	Inzu.
I thought he was gone	Natekereje ko yari amaze kugenda
He would then return to work.	Icyo gihe yari gusubira ku kazi.
I need to know how you did it	Ngomba kumenya uko wabikoze
We have to do it more than ever.	Tugomba kubikora kuruta ikindi gihe cyose.
I can't believe he's doing it so fast	Sinshobora kwizera ko akora vuba
They have a problem.	Bafite ikibazo.
He had the opportunity to live.	Yagize amahirwe yo kubaho.
He should have been a good listener.	Yari akwiye kuba umuntu yumva neza.
I like to do this again, to be close to him	Nkunda kongera gukora ibi, kuba hafi ye
I just didn't know what else to do	Gusa sinari nzi ikindi gukora
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
I can't say what it is	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo aricyo
He was bad.	Yari afite nabi.
I have a plan to get my hair done	Mfite gahunda yo kubona umusatsi wanjye
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
I never heard of it	Nta kintu nigeze numva
It started.	Yatangiye.
She loves the idea.	Akunda igitekerezo.
But we really do have a plan.	Ariko rwose dufite gahunda.
I know you know what to do	Nzi ko uzi icyo gukora
He knew he wanted more.	Yari azi ko ashaka byinshi.
I didn’t need to see much.	Sinari nkeneye kubona byinshi.
There is no truth.	Nta kuri.
He wanted to be young.	Yashakaga kuba muto.
I love this one very much	Nkunda iyi cyane
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I don't know for sure	Ntabwo nzi rwose
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Why? 	Kuki?
I know what he does	Nzi icyo akora
Anyone with a phone.	Umuntu wese ufite terefone.
There are people here.	Hano hari abantu.
I can do this one thing absolutely.	Nshobora gukora iki kintu kimwe rwose.
You can live longer.	Urashobora kubaho igihe kirekire.
And it's not good enough.	Kandi ntabwo ari mwiza bihagije.
Easy to drink.	Kunywa byoroshye.
Together.	Gufata hamwe.
He needed more, more.	Yari akeneye byinshi, byinshi.
I was never scared.	Sinigeze numva ubwoba.
At the time, I was scared too	Icyo gihe nanjye nari mfite ubwoba
I was not going to give up	Ntabwo nari ngiye kureka
As if together.	Nka hamwe na hamwe.
I was looking for a good person	Nashakaga umuntu mwiza
You can't stay here for long.	Ntushobora kuguma hano igihe kirekire.
I really needed it.	Nari nkeneye cyane.
I think you can go home now	Ndatekereza ko ushobora gutaha ubu
I think that's very difficult.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bigoye cyane.
But it will be soon.	Ariko bizaba vuba.
There are some difficult questions here.	Hano hari ibibazo bigoye.
They have this world.	Bafite iyi si.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
She is younger than me.	Ari muto kundusha.
From there.	Kuva aho.
I just want to see soon	Ndashaka gusa kureba vuba
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, mubyukuri.
He loved many people.	Yakundaga abantu benshi.
You can't go home.	Ntushobora gutaha.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
It's another time.	Ni ikindi gihe.
I highly doubt this	Ndashidikanya rwose kuri ibi
I want to be a guy who does things	Ndashaka kuba umusore ukora ibintu
He had it now.	Yari afite ubu.
Reasons for more.	Impamvu kuri byinshi.
I think he may be right	Ntekereza ko ashobora kuba afite ukuri
Apparently he does.	Biragaragara ko abikora.
I work fast.	Nkora vuba.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikibazo cyane.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
I was looking for a friend	Nashakaga inshuti
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
He has not acted since.	Kuva icyo gihe ntabwo yakoze.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I can't even read this	Sinshobora no gusoma ibi
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu agomba gutsinda.
But there is no job.	Ariko nta kazi ahari.
I was scared of this	Nari mfite ubwoba kuri ibi
Not very likely.	Ntabwo bishoboka cyane.
One can take a lot	Umuntu arashobora gufata byinshi
I needed to do something	Nari nkeneye kugira icyo nkora
Yes, you are very good.	Nibyo, uri mwiza cyane.
That's really cool, too	Nibyiza rwose, kandi
I wanted to feel closer to him, to us	Nashakaga kumva hafi ye, kuri twe
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He saw that.	Yabonye ibyo.
In any case, it is possible.	Ibyo ari byo byose, birashoboka.
He can't even say a word.	Ntashobora no kugira icyo avuga.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
I think so, but whatever	Ntekereza, ariko ibyo aribyo byose
At that time and now.	Kuri icyo gihe no kuri ubu.
In fact, that would be nice.	Mubyukuri, ibyo byaba byiza.
He didn't really want to.	Ntiyashakaga rwose.
I can't wait for that	Sinshobora gutegereza gutya
He could do everything.	Yashoboraga gukora byose.
He can leave.	Arashobora kuva.
I don't know why	Ntabwo nzi impamvu aribyo
You can't see anything wrong.	Ntushobora kubona ikintu kibi.
Probably not the best.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza rwose.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
He never did anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora.
I needed it so much	Nari nkeneye hafi cyane
I never felt bad or low	Sinigeze numva ko ari mubi cyangwa hasi
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Not tomorrow, not tomorrow, but today.	Ntabwo ari ejo, si ejo, ariko uyu munsi.
And it’s not just one thing.	Kandi ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe gusa.
I have a job nearby.	Mfite akazi hafi ya.
I want them all here	Ndashaka ko bose hano hano
I'm glad you did.	Nishimiye ko wabikoze.
I want to see everything one day	Ndashaka kubona byose umunsi umwe
They are nothing to him.	Ntacyo bari kuri we.
This is a big deal.	Iki ni ikintu kinini.
I think this time is good	Ntekereza ko iki gihe ari cyiza
We have to see more about him, no.	Tugomba kubona byinshi kuri we, ntabwo.
He always knows when.	Buri gihe aba azi igihe.
You don't have to listen.	Ntugomba kumva.
I should be home a little later.	Nkwiye kuba murugo nyuma gato.
One has to eat.	Umuntu agomba kurya.
This was normal.	Ibi byari bisanzwe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka gato.
He was young.	Yari akiri muto.
It’s something anyone can do.	Ni ikintu umuntu wese ashobora gukora.
My money was gone.	Amafaranga yanjye yari yagiye.
This one was not.	Uyu ntiyari.
But that is probably the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko aribyo.
He wanted to help people with problems.	Yashakaga gufasha abantu bafite ibibazo.
I thought so too.	Nanjye natekereje.
I don’t believe many people are in this	Ntabwo nizera ko abantu benshi bari muri ibi
I mean always	Ndashaka kuvuga buri gihe
And he.	Na we.
Everyone has an opinion.	Umuntu wese afite igitekerezo.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu atari.
He didn't mean to offend anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga ikindi kibi.
I shouldn’t have heard of my friend	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kumva inshuti yanjye
I really am.	Nukuri ndi.
I wanted to be bad	Nashakaga kuba mubi
You really have to talk to him.	Ugomba rwose kuvugana nawe.
Good work plan.	Gahunda nziza yo gukora.
I've been good at that	Nigeze kuba mwiza kuri ibyo
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I'm not very good at it.	Ntabwo ndi umuhanga cyane.
I can't do that	Sinshobora kubikora
I don't need that.	Ntabwo nkeneye ibyo.
But we are all now.	Ariko twese turi ubu.
But then at that time.	Ariko icyo gihe icyo gihe.
It is not enough to tell the truth.	Ntabwo bihagije kuvuga ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I think he was just lucky	Ntekereza ko yagize amahirwe gusa
I have to find something	Ngomba gushaka ikintu
I know very well	Nzi neza cyane
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.
She had already realized that for him alone.	Yari amaze kubona ko kuri we wenyine.
Making money.	Kubona amafaranga.
I mean, everything went well.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ibintu byose byagenze neza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ko ikintu aricyo gusa.
He went alone.	Yagiye wenyine.
He got it all.	Yabonye byose.
He wasn't really going to say anything.	Ntabwo rwose yari agiye kugira icyo avuga.
I knew it was good.	Nari nzi ko ari byiza.
He spoke in support of the US Alliance, but said that maintaining some independence was important.	Yavuze kuri byinshi kuri ibyo.
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu
He was still eating.	Yari akiri kurya.
Here we are.	Hano turi.
I have to.	Ngomba kugira.
I would just walk away	Nari kugenda gusa
But that was not the case at the time.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo byari ukuri icyo gihe.
He is one of us now.	Ni umwe muri twe ubu.
It was hard to say here.	Byari bigoye kuvuga hano.
This is really good.	Ibi ni byiza rwose.
I know he has been wanting this for a long time	Nzi ko yashakaga ibi igihe kirekire
We can't stop the car.	Ntidushobora guhagarika imodoka.
I was not sure who he was	Sinari nzi neza uwo ari we
I have a problem	Mfite ikibazo neza
I was three years old at the time	Icyo gihe nari mfite imyaka itatu
.	.
Wisdom.	Ubwenge.
I don't believe he did.	Ntabwo nizera ko yabikoze.
People you know.	Abantu uzi.
I thought about it.	Natekereje neza.
I really need to talk to you.	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana nawe.
If he is gone.	Niba yagiye.
I was not his friend	Ntabwo nari inshuti ye
He went.	Yagiye.
Living is not the issue.	Kubaho ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
I’m playing all the time.	Ndimo gukina buri gihe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo, kinini.
I needed to know more	Nari nkeneye kumenya byinshi
That's good.	Nibyiza.
And that was it.	Kandi byari ibi.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I need to know something else	Nkeneye kumenya ikindi kintu
The dog had gone.	Imbwa yari yagiye.
That's not his problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo cye.
I hope to work hard	Nizera gukora cyane
I can't look again	Sinshobora kongera kureba
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
I like work.	Nkunda akazi.
She was young and very beautiful.	Yari muto kandi mwiza cyane.
He loves what he does.	Akunda ibyo akora.
The little girl first of all.	Umukobwa muto mbere ya byose.
In fact, we can say a lot.	Mubyukuri, dushobora kuvuga byinshi.
It went wrong.	Byagenze nabi.
I have to have faith	Ngomba kugira kwizera
It is best to leave the program.	Nibyiza kureka gahunda.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
It is in us.	Ni muri twe.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
Inside is a young man.	Imbere hari umusore.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
He knew it was my fault.	Yari azi ko ari amakosa yanjye.
I don’t have to do it all day.	Ntabwo ngomba kubikora umunsi wose.
But that is another time.	Ariko ibyo ni ikindi gihe.
I heard it was there	Numvise ko ahari
But no.	Ariko nta.
He knows what reading is.	Azi icyo gusoma aricyo.
I can never be human again	Sinshobora kongera kuba umuntu
I don't want to be.	Sinshaka kuba.
I was not sure why we were here	Sinari nzi neza impamvu twari hano
I did not know who he was.	Sinari nzi uwo ari we.
I think we can go and see where it is	Ndakeka ko dushobora kujya kureba aho
We are very close.	Turi hafi cyane.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
The same thing happened with him.	Na we ni ko byagenze.
They have a gift.	Bafite impano.
He had no children.	Ntabwo yari afite abana.
I was happy with my luck.	Nishimiye amahirwe yanjye.
I didn't want to know that	Sinifuzaga kumenya icyo
Everything was fine.	Ibintu byose byari byiza.
I know he's out here	Nzi ko ari hanze aha
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
Anyone can.	Umuntu wese birashoboka.
He could have done this better.	Yashoboraga gukora iki cyiza.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
And you can do that.	Kandi urashobora kubikora.
But it did not go well after that.	Ariko ntabwo byagenze neza nyuma ya.
I need to talk to you now	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe ubu
I wanted to try	Nashakaga kugerageza
This is my house.	Iyi ni yo nzu yanjye.
But we don't have to talk about time.	Ariko ntabwo ari twe tugomba kuvuga igihe.
I have one day	Mfite umunsi umwe
He was there, he was there.	Yari ahari, yari ahari.
I finally have a family	Amaherezo mfite umuryango
It went wrong.	Byagenze nabi.
I think he probably knew why	Ntekereza ko bishoboka ko yari azi impamvu
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
I think this is a good thing	Ntekereza ko iki ari ikintu cyiza
I love the inside out	Nkunda cyane imbere imbere
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo gihe icyo gihe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Nawe birashoboka.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I need to go with you	Nkeneye kujyana nawe
Or later.	Cyangwa nyuma.
I love children and I thought of being a teacher	Nkunda abana kandi natekereje kuba umwarimu
Until he.	Kugeza we.
I wanted to see what you liked about it	Nashakaga kureba icyo ukunda kuri yo
But, in that case.	Ariko, mugihe aribyo.
For a long time	Mu gihe kirekire.
He felt he was doing it now.	Yumvise ko abikora ubu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
But he did not know what to do.	Ariko ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
I just never really believed he was.	Gusa sinigeze nizera cyane ko ari we.
You are the problem.	Ni wowe kibazo.
I am not.	Nanjye sibyo.
That's all right.	Nibyiza byose.
For all he knew, he thought it was.	Kubyo yari azi byose, yatekereje ko aribyo.
I have a lot to learn	Mfite byinshi byo kwiga
You can do it yourself.	Urashobora kubikora wenyine.
I didn't think so	Ntacyo natekerezaga
I just didn’t have it.	Gusa sinari mfite.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Something to do.	Ikintu cyo gukora.
Absolutely	Nukuri rwose
But the idea is the same.	Ariko igitekerezo ni kimwe.
He is now near you.	Ubu ari hafi yawe.
I feel really good about that	Ndumva rwose ari byiza kuri ibyo
he says.	avuga.
He said it was easy.	Yavuze ko byari byoroshye.
I didn't see anything wrong	Ntabwo nabonye ikintu kibi rwose
Not many cars.	Ntabwo imodoka nyinshi.
What it is today, obviously not.	Niki muri iki gihe, biragaragara ko atari.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
He was completely alone.	Yari wenyine rwose.
My beautiful son.	Umuhungu wanjye mwiza.
I have an idea what to do	Mfite igitekerezo icyo tugomba gukora
But not me.	Ariko si njye.
I never saw that	Sinigeze mbona ibyo
You are bad.	Urimo kuba mubi.
She loves her son.	Akunda umuhungu we.
No reason at all.	Nta mpamvu rwose.
I can do everything right	Nshobora gukora byose neza
A little thing	Ikintu gito
I was not good at it	Ntabwo nari mwiza muri byo
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
He would do nothing in school.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari gukora mu ishuri.
That's right everyone.	Nibyo buri wese.
I'm back when you want to go	Ndi inyuma mugihe ushaka kugenda
I wanted to help.	Nashakaga gufasha.
I really want to win	Ndashaka rwose gutsinda
Like this.	Nka iyi.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Things didn't work out.	Ibintu ntabwo byagenze.
I knew who he was	Nari nzi uwo ari we
I did not know this	Ntabwo nari nzi ibi
He didn't say much.	Ntiyigeze avuga byinshi.
I'm glad to be here	Nishimiye kuza hano
I heard nothing about him	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise kuri we
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
Only this was not a movie.	Gusa iyi ntiyari firime.
Apparently he heard nothing.	Biragaragara ko ntacyo yumvise.
Not now, at no time.	Ntabwo ari ubu, nta gihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
I never saw him sitting there	Sinigeze mbona yicaye aho
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
It doesn't look very good.	Ntabwo asa neza cyane.
Now he is doing well.	Ubu arimo akora neza.
No one is here.	Nta muntu uri hano.
I think everything is fine	Ntekereza ko ibintu byose ari byiza
I love children.	Nkunda abana.
I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.	Sinshobora kumenya icyo nkora nabi.
It would go well.	Byari kugenda neza.
No one has ever heard of that.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze yumva ibyo.
I was three years old.	Nari mfite imyaka itatu.
He had enough to think about right now.	Yari afite bihagije byo gutekereza kuri ubu.
I was never scared	Sinigeze mbona ubwoba
Very good, but very good.	Byiza cyane, ariko byiza cyane.
I should have stayed away	Nari nkwiye kuguma kure
I have to go now	Ngomba kugenda ubu
I should have given up	Nari nkwiye kureka
There is a party here	Hano hari ibirori
Almost everyone has a car.	Abantu hafi ya bose bafite imodoka.
He had no phone.	Nta terefone ye yari afite.
No one was in the room.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uri mu cyumba.
But what do I know.	Ariko nzi iki.
I thought we could go back tomorrow	Natekereje ko dushobora gusubira inyuma ejo
Little did I know that at the time	Ntabwo nari nzi ko icyo gihe
I think they are on me	Ndatekereza ko bari kuri njye
It was his fault.	Byari amakosa ye.
I don’t just want to make money.	Ntashaka gushaka amafaranga gusa.
I can't say for sure right now	Sinshobora kuvuga neza ubu
I know you don't like it	Nzi ko atari byo ukunda
I can't do that and win	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ibyo no gutsinda
I mean, everything.	Ndashaka kuvuga, byose.
I have a way of doing things	Mfite uburyo bwo gukora ibintu
I wanted to stay there	Nashakaga kuguma aho
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko igihe kimwe yari.
I shouldn't have done that	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora
Or this week.	Cyangwa muri iki cyumweru.
I think that's a good idea	Ntekereza ko icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza
'	'
People know it's not him.	Abantu bazi ko atari we.
You are a good young man.	Uri umusore mwiza.
This is us.	Uyu ni twe.
I don't want to go back	Sinshaka gusubira inyuma
His bus was gone.	Bisi ye yari yagiye.
I really don't want to talk about this	Sinshaka rwose kuvuga kuri ibi
We are not far away.	Ntabwo turi kure.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
You didn't do it.	Ntabwo wabikoze.
I never felt like I wanted to go far	Sinigeze numva nshaka kugenda kure
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
I just didn't know what it was	Gusa sinari nzi neza icyo aricyo
And you can too.	Kandi nawe urashobora.
Like him.	Nkuko we.
I don’t think it’s the same now.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari kimwe ubu.
Everything is true so far.	Byose ni ukuri kugeza ubu.
There is also a small problem.	Hariho kandi ikibazo gito.
He is alone.	Ni wenyine.
Absolutely.	Ari rwose.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, yasaga nkaho afite amahirwe kuri yo.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
He is right about that.	Afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
I knew who he was	Nari nzi uwo ari we
It is not a chance.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe.
You can't make a phone call !.	Ntushobora gukora terefone!.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
No one knew where they were.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho bari.
This is a lot.	Ibi ni byinshi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
And that.	Kandi ibyo.
I hope someone knows what to do	Nizere ko umuntu azi icyo gukora
In fact, you can find someone you can trust.	Mubyukuri, urashobora kubona umuntu ushobora kwizera.
I was scared	Nagize ubwoba
I mean he told me	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yambwiye
I have to look at this.	Ngomba kureba muri ibi.
He heard.	Yumvise.
I know you don't want to do this	Nzi ko udashaka gukora ibi
Definitely a problem.	Rwose ni ikibazo.
He loved someone once.	Yakundaga umuntu rimwe.
We don’t need to, though.	Ntabwo dukeneye, ariko.
There is only this.	Hariho ibi gusa.
That's right.	Nukuri.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
I just know my daughter, that's all	Gusa nzi umukobwa wanjye, ni byose
Good time is good.	Umwanya mwiza ni mwiza.
She said she needed to eat.	Yavuze ko akeneye kurya.
It's not fair to say that.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuvuga gutya.
I find myself doing nothing	Njye mbona ntacyo nkora
I'm not going.	Ntabwo ngiye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I had the same problem	Nagize ikibazo kimwe
It’s not a bad idea for a movie.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi kuri firime.
Very good !.	Byiza cyane!.
Probably someone.	Birashoboka ko hari umuntu.
He was worried.	Yaba afite impungenge.
I would talk to you	Nari kuvugana nawe
I didn't know where he went	Sinari nzi aho yagiye
I shouldn't have said much	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuvuga byinshi
I got what he wanted.	Nabonye icyo ashaka.
I had nothing to say	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo kuvuga
You don't have a long time.	Ntabwo ufite igihe kirekire.
I had thought before	Nari natekereje mbere
I think he meant it	Ndatekereza ko ashaka kuvuga
In fact, it is one.	Mubyukuri, ni umwe.
I just didn't understand why	Gusa sinigeze numva impamvu
I think we can live longer	Ndakeka ko dushobora kubaho igihe kirekire
It would have been great	Yaba yari mwiza cyane
It wasn’t a lot of money.	Ntabwo byari amafaranga cyane.
It will be a big problem.	Bizaba ikibazo kinini.
That's exactly what he told me.	Nibyo rwose yambwiye.
I wanted to eat the same.	Nashakaga kurya kimwe.
You have to buy food.	Ugomba kugura ibiryo.
I needed to learn a lot	Nari nkeneye kwiga ibintu byinshi
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza ko ibyo atari ukuri rwose.
And he didn't know what to do.	Kandi ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
I was really scared	Nagize ubwoba mubyukuri
I hope he has nothing good	Nizera ko nta cyiza afite
I'm not winning.	Ntabwo ndimo gutsinda.
I know what to do now.	Nzi icyo gukora ubu.
And you can be one.	Kandi ushobora kuba umwe.
We have no plans.	Ntabwo dufite gahunda.
He looked in front of her.	Yarebye imbere ye.
I was lucky too	Nanjye nagize amahirwe
Close, but not right.	Hafi, ariko sibyo.
I know this is a matter of faith.	Nzi ko iki ari ikibazo cyo kwizera.
He did not comment.	Ntiyigeze agira icyo avuga.
He had nothing to say.	Nta cyo yari afite cyo kuvuga.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kumenya gusa ko nawe ushobora.
To.	Kuri.
But nothing.	Ariko nta na kimwe.
She was probably her hair.	Birashoboka ko yari umusatsi we.
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
I like to do it	Nkunda kubikora
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ni ko byagenze.
I didn't see any of that though	Ntacyo nabonye muri ibyo ariko
Good time, gift.	Igihe cyiza, impano.
Something to think about.	Ikintu cyo gutekereza.
He needed to talk to her.	Yari akeneye kuvugana na we.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
But you are one.	Ariko uri umwe.
The car started moving.	Imodoka yatangiye kugenda.
Anything.	Ikintu cyose.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It was great here.	Byari byiza hano.
There is so much to think about and do.	Hariho byinshi byo gutekereza no gukora.
I needed to be where people were	Nari nkeneye kuba aho hari abantu
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ikindi kibazo kimwe.
I didn't want to.	Ntabwo nashakaga.
I was not sure of that	Sinari nzi neza ibyo
That's right.	Nibyo.
There is something here for everyone.	Hano hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
There is money here.	Hano hari amafaranga.
I am very happy with what happened	Nishimiye cyane uko byagenze
I didn't have time to read the book	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo gusoma igitabo
It is not a chance.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo.
I needed to know if my family had done it	Nari nkeneye kumenya niba umuryango wanjye wabikoze
No one said much.	Nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
We all have one.	Twese dufite umwe.
Away from him	Kure ye.
It was a great time to win.	Wari umwanya mwiza wo gutsinda.
I don't know what the problem is.	Ntabwo nzi ikibazo icyo ari cyo.
He is 'inside' all the time.	Ari 'imbere' igihe cyose.
By now he may have gone.	Kugeza ubu ashobora kuba yagiye.
We just need a little back.	Dukeneye gusa gato inyuma.
I thought it was good for him	Natekereje ko byari byiza kuri we
I would not go easy	Ntabwo nari kugenda byoroshye
I wouldn't know much about that	Ntabwo nari kumenya byinshi kuri ibyo
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I need to get out of here	Nkeneye kuva hano
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I know it's true.	Nzi ko ari ukuri.
I shouldn't have come here	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuza hano
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
He probably didn’t expect to win.	Birashoboka ko atari yiteze gutsinda.
And it would be nice.	Kandi byaba byiza.
I really wanted to see what you have	Nashakaga rwose kureba icyo ufite
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I can't find anything here	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu hano
I don't want to be anything.	Sinshaka kuba ikintu na kimwe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byose ari ukuri.
You need someone you can trust.	Ukeneye umuntu ushobora kwizera.
Her baby looks good.	Umwana we usa neza.
I really wanted to	Nashakaga cyane
I didn’t want to do this	Sinifuzaga gukora ibi
I really didn’t want to go back	Sinifuzaga rwose gusubira inyuma
You can even be alone.	Urashobora no kuba wenyine.
Everyone is close.	Umuntu wese aba hafi.
I love his car.	Nkunda imodoka ye.
I never liked it very much	Sinigeze nkunda cyane
One book to get.	Igitabo kimwe cyo kubona.
He may be right now.	Kuri ubu arashobora kuba afite ukuri.
I know who you mean by now	Nzi uwo ushaka kuvuga ubu
You have	Ufite.
We don't have that.	Ntabwo dufite 'ibyo.
I knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Nari nzi ko nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
I am one and they are all one	Ndi umwe kandi umwe ni bose
Yesterday I was not there	Ejo ntabwo nari ndimo
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
I have enough of that	Mfite ibyo bihagije
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
However, that may not be what you want.	Ariko, ibyo birashoboka ko atari byo ushaka.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo nibyiza.
Obviously I'm doing something wrong.	Biragaragara ko ndimo gukora ikintu kibi.
We were upstairs.	Twari hejuru.
I think this would be the case.	Ntekereza ko ibi byaba aribyo.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
That would be nice enough.	Byaba byiza bihagije.
I didn’t want to wait long	Sinifuzaga gutegereza igihe kirekire
Getting it is good.	Kubona ni byiza.
I didn’t want to go too far.	Sinifuzaga kujya kure cyane.
I didn't have a week	Nta cyumweru nagize
I want to win here	Ndashaka gutsinda hano
I had no plans to do so	Ntabwo nari mfite gahunda yo kubikora
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He has to be close.	Agomba kuba hafi.
But this is definitely possible.	Ariko ibi birashoboka rwose.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
Looks like he's gone.	Birasa nkaho yagiye.
He was his first friend.	Yari inshuti ye ya mbere.
I should have done	Nari nkwiye gukora
Everything is true.	Ibintu byose nukuri.
And all questions are the same.	Kandi ibibazo byose birasa.
I know how to read.	Nzi gusoma.
But not your daughter.	Ariko si umukobwa wawe.
He knew it was true.	Yari azi ko ari ukuri.
He said it was possible.	Yavuze ko bishoboka.
All, all, all.	Byose, byose, byose.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
I have a reason to live now	Mfite impamvu yo kubaho ubu
Yes, they did have a lot of friends.	Nibyo, bari bafite inshuti nyinshi.
I was scared, both for myself and for him	Nagize ubwoba, kuri njye no kuri we
I never thought it would be possible	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza ko bishoboka
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
I have to get out of here	Ngomba kuva hano
There is a lot of opportunity here.	Hano hari amahirwe menshi.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I know it's great	Nzi ko ari byiza cyane
I want to eat someone here	Ndashaka kurya umuntu hano
I am too young for him.	Ndi muto cyane kuri we.
But you have to be good.	Ariko ugomba kuba mwiza.
Not really you.	Ntabwo ari wowe rwose.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
And this is great.	Kandi ibi ni byiza cyane.
But it was only for a short time.	Ariko byari mu gihe gito.
You can't give up.	Ntushobora kureka.
I think that's the idea	Ntekereza ko icyo ari igitekerezo
He had nothing for him.	Kuri we nta cyo yari afite.
I can't say for sure	Sinshobora kuvuga neza
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
There are things you just know.	Hariho ibintu uzi gusa.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
I would do anything he said	Nari gukora ikintu cyose yavuze
And as he did before.	Kandi nkuko yabikoze mbere.
He can really be good.	Ashobora rwose kuba mwiza.
We are here, today, today.	Turi hano, muri iki gihe, muri iki gihe.
I think he should get a job as a teacher.	Ntekereza ko agomba kubona akazi ko kuba umwarimu.
Luckily he didn't know what to do.	Amahirwe ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora.
I don't know for sure.	Ntabwo nzi rwose.
I thought you wanted to hear	Natekereje ko ushaka kumva
I'm not sure that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo rwose.
I've done this before	Nagize ibi mbere
You don't know what to do.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo gukora.
I want to stay here.	Ndashaka kuguma hano.
I needed help	Nari nkeneye ubufasha
Maybe I need more time.	Ahari nkeneye igihe kinini.
He was my friend.	Yari inshuti yanjye.
I knew there was no reason	Nari nzi ko nta mpamvu
He seems to know everyone.	Asa nkaho azi abantu bose.
He does this every day.	Ibyo abikora buri munsi.
He was in.	Yari arimo.
The problems are many.	Ibibazo ni byinshi.
But there is always something.	Ariko buri gihe hariho ikintu.
I had finally found my place	Amaherezo nari nabonye umwanya wanjye
It was very difficult to see things.	Byari bigoye cyane kubona ibintu.
I think I'll be back soon	Ndatekereza gutaha vuba
I have a problem at the moment	Mfite ikibazo icyo gihe
She wanted to take her daughter.	Yashakaga gufata umukobwa we.
I hope you were fine too	Ndizera ko nawe yari mwiza
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first	Ibyo ari byo byose nari kare kare
How much.	Nigute cyane.
There are children here.	Hano hari abana.
But that was not the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
He wanted to come.	Yashakaga kuza.
It was not his house.	Ntabwo yari inzu ye.
He thought he couldn't be right.	Yatekereje ko adashobora kuba afite ukuri.
And, no, no.	Kandi, na, na.
I just didn’t like it	Gusa sinigeze nkunda
His house is gone.	Inzu ye yagiye.
I wanted my time.	Nashakaga umwanya wanjye.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
I feel lonely here	Ndumva ndi hano wenyine
I just didn't know what it was	Gusa sinari nzi neza icyo aricyo
The guy.	Umusore.
I was embarrassed and scared	Nagize isoni kandi mfite ubwoba
I should try at the same time	Nkwiye kugerageza igihe kimwe
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
Every last one of them.	Buri kimwe cya nyuma muri byo.
I don't want to do that.	Ntashaka kubikora.
Time to look at.	Umwanya wo kureba kuri.
I want to see if she is home	Ndashaka kureba niba ari murugo
I saw, my clothes	Nabonye, ​​imyenda yanjye
She was probably your daughter.	Birashoboka ko yari umukobwa wawe.
And it is.	Kandi ni.
I also thought you saw that	Natekereje kandi ko wabonye ibyo
That's right.	Nibyo.
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
I can't do that	Sinshobora kubikora
I shouldn’t have looked	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kureba
As everyone else does, in fact.	Nkuko buri wese abikora, mubyukuri.
You are nothing to him.	Ntacyo uri kuri we.
That was on him.	Uwo yari kuri we.
At present it is not difficult.	Kuri ubu ntabwo bigoye.
The boy is always.	Umuhungu ahora.
I was not lucky.	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe.
I can't stay very far	Sinshobora kuguma kure cyane
That's not the problem.	Icyo si ikibazo.
Almost no one did.	Hafi ya nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
I like to have simple things	Nkunda kugira ibintu byoroshye
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
I know this is true for me.	Nzi ko ibi ari ukuri kuri njye.
How hard it is to go backwards, really ?.	Nigute bigoye gusubira inyuma, mubyukuri?.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, byoroshye.
We are right.	Turi kuri.
I heard his opinion	Numvise igitekerezo cye
He is playing with you.	Arimo gukina nawe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikibazo cyane.
I should help with that	Nkwiye gufasha muri ibyo
Years ahead together.	Imyaka iri imbere hamwe.
I wanted to give up.	Nashakaga kureka.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
I want to live.	Ndashaka kubaho.
Good to say.	Nibyiza kuvuga.
I never thought much of it	Sinigeze ntekereza cyane kuri byo
Going that way.	Kugenda gutya.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
The only job you can do	Akazi gusa ushobora gukora
In fact, it was good.	Mubyukuri, byari byiza.
But he was human.	Ariko yari umuntu.
But in the end.	Ariko amaherezo.
He got the book.	Yabonye igitabo.
I can't.	Sinshobora.
He was inside.	Yari imbere.
From the ground up.	Kuva hasi.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
I can wait a while	Nshobora gutegereza igihe gito
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
They have children.	Bafite abana.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
I have a job for him	Mfite akazi kuri we
He knows a lot about who he is.	Azi byinshi uwo ari we.
I like that movie.	Nkunda iyo firime.
You need to buy more.	Ukeneye kugura byinshi.
You should have gone ahead.	Wari ukwiye kujya imbere.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I know this is not always easy.	Nzi ko ibyo atari ko buri gihe byoroshye.
I never believed it was possible.	Ntabwo nigeze nizera ko bishoboka.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
I'm having a lot.	Ndimo kuba byinshi.
I think the same bad thing you think.	Ndatekereza ikintu kimwe kibi utekereza.
Now i'm fine	Ubu ndi mwiza.
He’s not going to do things	Ntabwo agiye gukora ibintu
I have things to learn.	Mfite ibintu byo kwiga.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
And that's not the place to be.	Kandi aho ntabwo ari umwanya we wo kubikora.
He is not at work.	Ntabwo ari mu kazi.
I want to stay	Ndashaka kuguma
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I like a lot of normal things	Nkunda ibintu byinshi bisanzwe
Maybe this is an opportunity.	Ahari ibi ni amahirwe.
I was not here.	Ntabwo nari hano.
I'm very worried about that.	Mfite impungenge cyane kuri ibyo.
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
Eventually he was about to get what he had asked for.	Amaherezo yari agiye kubona ibyo yari yasabye.
I didn't know what happened	Sinari nzi uko byagenze
Everything is true.	Byose ni ukuri.
He knew what had happened.	Yari azi uko byagenze.
I am always here, if you need to talk or anything else.	Nama ndi hano, niba ukeneye kuvuga cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
More than just learning.	Kurenza kwiga gusa.
I like being around you	Nkunda kuba hafi yawe
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
That was close, however.	Ibyo byari hafi cyane, ariko.
Everything is better than doing something.	Ikintu cyose cyiza kuruta gukora ikintu.
I am very lucky to have	Mfite amahirwe cyane ko mfite
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
That you want and need to succeed.	Ko ushaka kandi ukeneye gutsinda.
In fact, you did.	Mubyukuri wabikoze.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
I have a small problem	Mfite ikibazo gito
It was not your time.	Ntabwo yari umwanya wawe.
I was not at the time	Icyo gihe ntabwo nari
He wants me to see him.	Ashaka ko mbona.
Are you alone	Ni wowe wenyine?
I really wanted to	Nashakaga rwose
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ni kimwe nanjye.
The young man was outside.	Umusore yari hanze.
I had everything, everything one wanted	Nari mfite byose, buri kintu cyose umuntu yashakaga
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekerezaga.
Watching and waiting.	Kureba no gutegereza.
I want this with you	Ndashaka ibi hamwe nawe
I feel like you really don’t want to.	Ndumva udashaka mubyukuri.
I think that's good	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
I heard.	Numvise.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I'm not here to do that.	Ntabwo ndi hano kubikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I needed bad money	Nari nkeneye amafaranga mubi
But it happened.	Ariko byagenze.
It's a job.	Ni akazi.
There is a lot to say.	Hariho byinshi byo kuvuga.
And that's right.	Kandi uko ni ukuri.
I don't really know what he said	Ntabwo nzi rwose ibyo yavuze
But he was his friend.	Ariko yari inshuti ye.
He thought it was normal or too much.	Yatekereje ko atari bisanzwe cyangwa byinshi.
He was close.	Yari hafi.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni cyo kibazo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I like to help people	Nkunda gufasha abantu
I just felt so sorry.	Gusa numvise mbabajwe cyane.
This seems to be the case at the top.	Ibi birasa nkaho ari hejuru.
I feel like a good person with you	Ndumva ari umuntu mwiza hamwe nawe
I need to take things one day at a time	Nkeneye gufata ibintu umunsi umwe umwe
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
You have to take years.	Ugomba gufata imyaka.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kugeza vuba aha.
And apparently he was human.	Kandi biragaragara ko yari umuntu.
Tonight, no.	Iri joro, sibyo.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta kibazo na kimwe muri byo.
That's exactly what happened.	Nibyo rwose biragaragara.
In fact, doing it is really good.	Mubyukuri, gukora nibyiza rwose.
I do what they are afraid to do	Nkora ibyo bafite ubwoba bwo gukora
He had.	Yari afite.
I didn't quite understand what he meant at the time	Sinigeze numva neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga icyo gihe
Sometimes, though.	Rimwe na rimwe, naho.
He has a job to do.	Afite akazi agomba gukora.
I am very far away.	Ndi kure cyane.
I don't think so, but it is possible.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko, ariko birashoboka.
He says he wants to do it.	Avuga ko ashaka kubikora.
I was scared it was normal	Nari mfite ubwoba byari bisanzwe
It's too soon.	Ni vuba cyane.
Only things he says.	Gusa ibintu avuga.
Very good stuff here.	Ibintu byiza cyane hano.
I can't say what to do	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo ugomba gukora
Obviously why are you here.	Biragaragara impamvu uri hano.
This time it is bus.	Iki gihe ni bisi.
He went.	Yagiye.
I did, and it worked	Nakoze, kandi byagenze neza
None of that right now.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ubu.
It looks like.	Birasa nkaho.
Glad you are here !.	Nishimiye ko uri hano!.
They were not.	Ntabwo bari.
Sometimes it is possible.	Rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.
Now is not the time.	Ubu ntabwo aricyo gihe.
You were a boy here.	Wari umuhungu hano.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, byose byari byiza cyane.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
I thought about what you said	Natekereje kubyo wavuze
I'm glad you like this.	Nishimiye ko ukunda ibi.
He never lived in one.	Ntabwo yigeze aba muri umwe.
I could never do that	Sinigeze nshobora kubikora
So far, no problem.	Kugeza ubu, nta kibazo.
I wanted to be me again	Nashakaga kongera kuba njye
By then he was gone.	Icyo gihe yari yagiye.
You can't have one.	Ntushobora kugira kimwe.
He was not sure if he had heard anything.	Ntabwo yari azi neza niba hari ibyo yumvise.
I didn't need to be scared.	Sinari nkeneye kugira ubwoba.
This is my family.	Uyu ni umuryango wanjye.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
If you’re scared, that’s fine.	Niba ufite ubwoba, nibyiza.
But where should he be.	Agomba ariko ari he.
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
I was lucky enough to find this one	Nagize amahirwe yo kubona iyi
And soon.	Kandi vuba.
He could not have come at a better time.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kuza mugihe cyiza.
I really enjoyed the book	Nishimiye cyane igitabo
Maybe he's here.	Birashoboka ko ari hano.
I want to stop everything	Ndashaka guhagarika ibintu byose
he says.	avuga.
Obviously it is possible.	Biragaragara ko bishoboka.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
Nowadays, you are lucky.	Iki gihe, ufite amahirwe.
Either one thing or the other.	Yaba ikintu kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
I thought it was great	Natekereje ko ari byiza cyane
They are scared.	Bafite ubwoba.
I can live with that for now	Nshobora kubana nibyo kugeza ubu
As easy as it is.	Nkuko byoroshye.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I did everything right	Nakoze byose neza
This one really has to get it.	Uyu rwose agomba kubona.
I wanted to, most of all	Nashakaga, kuruta byose
You were his son.	Wari umuhungu we.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
I just need to win	Nkeneye gusa gutsinda
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
And you said nothing.	Kandi ntacyo wavuze.
He asked if he wanted anything.	Yabajije niba hari icyo ashaka.
More than a boy.	Kurenza umuhungu.
And let it be.	Reka kandi.
It is good to take.	Nibyiza gufata.
I really wanted to talk	Nashakaga rwose kuvuga
And they have.	Kandi bafite.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari kugenda vuba.
I hope you can do the same	Nizere ko nawe ushobora kubikora
I have to be at home.	Ngomba kuba murugo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
This one seemed to be good.	Iyi yasaga nkaho ari nziza.
I needed to look at that house for a while.	Nari nkeneye kureba iyo nzu igihe gito.
There is a lot to do now.	Ubu hariho byinshi byo gukora.
Let them all together.	Reka bose hamwe.
He was absolutely right.	Yari afite ukuri rwose.
Take care.	Gufata neza.
He knew what he wanted to do with the player.	Yari azi icyo ashaka kubona umukinnyi.
If so.	Nigute se.
He was at work.	Yari mu kazi.
I never saw this	Sinigeze mbona ibi
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Quit.	Kureka.
I know it's me	Nzi ko ari njye mubyukuri
I don't know if that's the case.	Sinzi niba aribyo.
I wanted to learn more	Nashakaga kwiga byinshi
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Today he is not here.	Uyu munsi ntabwo ari hano.
There is only one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gusa.
We all have.	Twese dufite.
I like to be alone	Nkunda kuba wenyine
But this.	Ariko ibi.
I didn't need to look.	Sinari nkeneye kureba.
Probably they were.	Birashoboka ko bari.
Not me, man.	Ntabwo ari njye, muntu.
And this is not a good thing.	Kandi iki ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
It was good to play	Byari byiza gukina
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
It worked out well for him.	Byagenze neza kuri we.
And you can't go home.	Kandi ntushobora gutaha.
I never heard of it.	Nta kintu nigeze numva.
It can be very difficult.	Ashobora kuba bigoye cyane.
I am not sure of anything	Ntabwo nzi neza ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
He should have taken food, clothes.	Yari akwiye gufata ibiryo, imyenda.
I just need to know what to do	Nkeneye gusa kumenya icyo gukora
But not us.	Ariko si twe.
Kinini.	Kinini.
Absolutely girl	Umukobwa rwose
I have no good plans	Nta gahunda nziza mfite
And certainly not.	Kandi rwose sibyo.
You can read more about me here !.	Urashobora gusoma byinshi kuri njye hano!.
I didn’t have time to think	Sinari mfite umwanya wo gutekereza
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
I know it's possible.	Nzi ko bishoboka.
I knew what he was doing.	Nari nzi icyo arimo gukora.
I really enjoyed reading this	Nishimiye cyane gusoma ibi
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
He had not gone.	Ntiyari yagiye.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
Everything was close to me.	Ibintu byose byari hafi yanjye.
I can't play	Sinshobora gukina
I haven't thought about that to this day	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo kugeza uyu munsi
Especially if you are a woman.	Cyane cyane niba uri umugore.
I know exactly what you are up to	Nzi neza ibyo urimo
She was beautiful and beautiful.	Yari mwiza kandi mwiza.
And he was ready to go far.	Kandi yari yiteguye kujya kure.
Good things.	Ibintu byiza.
When, he can't speak.	Igihe, ntashobora kuvuga.
I didn't know why.	Sinari nzi impamvu.
I was in prison with you.	Nari muri gereza nawe.
I could see clearly	Nari mbona neza
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I got to stop working	Nabonye guhagarika gukora
I didn’t want him to be human	Sinifuzaga ko aba umuntu
In a short time, he had everything he needed	Igihe gito, nibyo yari akeneye byose
I can't find fault	Sinshobora kubona amakosa
You have to look at what it is.	Ugomba kureba icyo aricyo.
I think it's a good book	Ntekereza ko ari igitabo cyiza
But for him that was enough	Ariko kuri we ibyo byari bihagije
I feel nothing for him.	Ntacyo numva kuri we.
I didn't know it existed	Sinari nzi ko ahari
I knew this was the right time to go	Nari nzi ko iki aricyo gihe cyiza cyo kugenda
All the best.	Ibintu byiza byose.
I want to have a chance to talk to you	Ndashaka amahirwe yo kuvugana nawe
I didn’t want him to go	Sinifuzaga ko agenda
I should be.	Nkwiye kuba.
This was too much, too soon.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane, vuba cyane.
I didn't know how to study	Sinari nzi kwiga
For him it was normal.	Kuri we byari ibintu bisanzwe.
He was a very good child.	Yari umwana mwiza cyane.
It's time.	Ni igihe.
I just wanted to help	Nashakaga gufasha gusa
Obviously we needed something good.	Biragaragara ko twari dukeneye ikintu cyiza.
I think everyone knows when to leave.	Ntekereza ko abantu bose bazi igihe cyo kugenda.
You have to do whatever he wants.	Ugomba gukora icyo ashaka cyose.
In a short time no one saw it.	Mu gihe gito nta muntu yabonye.
I want to be with you	Ndashaka kubana nawe
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
I didn’t have much luck there	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe menshi aho
A short time.	Igihe gito.
I would make money.	Nari kubona amafaranga.
For me.	Kuri njye.
What do you have?	Ufite iki?.
Someone would be nice	Umuntu yaba mwiza
Now at home.	Ubu murugo.
You have to be alone.	Ugomba kuba wenyine.
But in reality, that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
I was the first person at the meeting.	Ninjye muntu wa mbere muri iyo nama.
I needed to know where he was.	Nari nkeneye kumenya aho yari ari.
I’m working on something.	Ndimo gukora ku kintu.
I think this is really good.	Ndatekereza ko ibi ari byiza rwose.
If anything.	Niba hari ikintu.
And close.	Kandi hafi.
It's good to wait.	Nibyiza gutegereza.
I love living with you.	Nkunda kubana nawe.
Baby.	Umwana.
He was just a boy.	Byari umuhungu gusa.
This is exactly what would happen.	Ibi nibyo rwose byari kuba.
I wanted that for him	Nashakaga ko kuri we
He knew what you were thinking.	Yari azi icyo utekereza.
You don’t like to be alone here.	Ntabwo ukunda kuba wenyine hano.
He knew he would do it.	Yari azi ko azabikora.
And just that.	Kandi gusa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I was not the same person	Ntabwo nari umuntu umwe
But that was true and not true.	Ariko ibyo byari ukuri kandi ntabwo byari ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He speaks well.	Avuga neza.
He has something to say.	Afite icyo avuga.
I doubt he does.	Ndashidikanya ko abikora.
I know a lot of people	Nzi abantu benshi
But he saw exactly what he had to do.	Ariko yabonye neza icyo agomba gukora.
He said he wanted to go home.	Yavuze ko yashakaga gutaha.
You don't know exactly what to believe.	Ntabwo uzi neza ibyo ugomba kwizera.
I can figure out what it is.	Nshobora kumenya icyo aricyo.
I never wanted to stay out.	Sinigeze nshaka kuguma hanze.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari na gato.
I had a good idea	Nari natekereje neza
I'm glad he did.	Nishimiye ko yabikoze.
I just want to hear	Ndashaka kumva gusa
I saw it all	Nabonye byose
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari.
Apparently he was very bad.	Biragaragara ko yari mubi cyane.
I can say a lot of things	Nshobora kuvuga ibintu byinshi
I think it's good	Ndakeka ko ari byiza
I have never seen such a beautiful woman.	Sinigeze mbona umugore mwiza cyane.
She was beautiful, very beautiful.	Yari mwiza, mwiza cyane.
I have done nothing wrong	Nta kibi nigeze nkora
I want to be	Ndashaka kuba
I didn't have a house	Sinari mfite inzu
He could have gone backwards.	Yashoboraga gusubira inyuma.
I need to catch up, do something	Nkeneye gufata, gukora ikintu
I saw nothing	Nta na kimwe nabonye
I'm not doing well in school	Ntabwo nkora neza mwishuri
I can't go.	Sinshobora kugenda.
He never had children.	Ntabwo yigeze agira abana.
Everything you really need.	Ikintu cyose ukeneye rwose.
But you have to try	Ariko ugomba kugerageza
I haven’t done it until recently	Ntabwo nakoze kugeza vuba aha
I had a bad day	Nari mfite umunsi mubi
Probably not all.	Birashoboka ko atari bose.
I was young.	Nari muto.
But that is not the case here.	Ariko ntabwo aricyo kibazo hano.
Or in me.	Cyangwa muri njye.
He knew he was there.	Yari azi ko yari ahari.
They both knew it wasn't him.	Bombi bari bazi ko atari we.
I don't think it's a dog.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari imbwa.
But this was too much.	Ariko ibi byari byinshi cyane.
I think that's what he does all day	Ntekereza ko aribyo akora umunsi wose
It was very simple.	Byari ibintu byoroshye cyane.
He knew what the problem was.	Yari azi ikibazo icyo ari cyo.
I didn't want to talk to anyone	Sinifuzaga kuvugana n'umwe
I was worried he had problems	Nari mfite impungenge ko afite ibibazo
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Good idea, no.	Igitekerezo cyiza, sibyo.
You can buy the book here.	Urashobora kugura igitabo hano.
He seemed to be.	Yasaga naho.
It all happened.	Byose byagenze.
You look bad.	Urashaka nabi.
I don't know how, until now	Sinzi uko, kugeza ubu
I never heard of his problem	Sinigeze numva ikibazo cye
You may think it is really good.	Urashobora gutekereza ko ari byiza rwose.
I think that's the first thing	Ntekereza ko aricyo kintu cya mbere
This is your friend '.	Iyi ni inshuti yawe '.
I know how to work from here.	Nzi gukora kuva aha.
I feel it every day	Ndumva buri munsi
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
My youngest daughter saw nothing.	Umukobwa wanjye muto ntacyo yabonye.
I want another time	Ndashaka ikindi gihe
That would be enough.	Byaba bihagije.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
It was not a party.	Ntabwo yari ibirori.
I know his problem	Nzi ikibazo cye
It’s not money for me.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga kuri njye.
I had planned to go	Nari natekereje kujyana
He wanted to do it.	Yashakaga kubikora.
That's right- this is not about me	Nibyiza, ariko nibyo gusa
I would go alone	Nari kugenda wenyine
Obviously it's good.	Biragaragara ko ari byiza.
Tell me if you need anything.	Mbwira niba hari icyo ukeneye.
There is a time to think.	Hari igihe cyo gutekereza.
At any time.	Igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
Where was his daughter?	Umukobwa we yari he.
She was a young woman.	Yari umugore muto.
You knew who he was.	Wari uzi uwo yari uwo.
I am afraid of what would happen	Mfite ubwoba uko byari kugenda
I just think it's a good thing to do.	Ndatekereza gusa ko ari ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I found a way to take the time.	Nabonye uburyo bwo gufata umwanya.
In fact more and more.	Mubyukuri byinshi kandi byinshi.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
I was scared.	Nabonye ubwoba.
I never loved anyone	Sinigeze nkunda umuntu
I can stay in the morning	Nshobora kuguma mu gitondo
But the move was imminent.	Ariko kugenda byari hafi.
I'm happy for both of you	Nishimiye bombi
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
It’s not really a big deal for me.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikintu kinini kuri njye.
He could think for himself.	Yashoboraga gutekereza neza wenyine.
He was his son.	Yari umuhungu we.
I am looking for a wife.	Ndashaka umugore wanjye.
Woman, boy	Umugore, umuhungu
I knew it was big	Nari nzi ko ari kinini
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
It's you	Ni wowe.
I haven't heard or seen anything	Ntacyo numvise cyangwa nabonye
I never heard of that	Sinigeze numva ibyo
We had a car that was.	Twari dufite imodoka yari.
You can't go to school.	Ntushobora kujya ku ishuri.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
I was him.	Nari we.
It was not difficult for him.	Ntabwo byari bigoye kuri we.
I needed to hear him speak	Nari nkeneye kumva avuga
Everything is the same for us.	Byose ni umwe kuri twe.
I was in front of him	Nari imbere ye
I was scared but I was doing well	Nagize ubwoba ariko nkora neza
I finally saw someone who did it	Amaherezo nabonye umuntu wabikoze
None of the above.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo hejuru.
All of this is true.	Ibi byose ni ukuri.
I didn't know you were in school	Sinari nzi ko wari mwishuri
But he did.	Ariko yagize icyo atekereza.
She is also beautiful.	Umugore kandi mwiza.
He was eating.	Yari arimo kurya.
I don’t want much.	Ntashaka byinshi.
You really have to stop doing that.	Ugomba rwose guhagarika gukora ibyo.
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
Now you know everything.	Ubu uzi byose.
I didn't know who to believe	Sinari nzi uwo nizera
You are.	Urimo.
You know what I'm thinking.	Uzi icyo ntekereza.
I know what you want to do	Nzi icyo ushaka gukora
And you may want to look away.	Kandi urashobora gushaka kureba kure.
I don't feel right.	Ntabwo numva ari ukuri.
I don't like that.	Ntabwo nkunda ko aribyo.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko byari byiza.
I really wanted to talk to you.	Nashakaga rwose kuvugana nawe.
I know what he likes	Nzi icyo akunda
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I have a house for me	Mfite inzu kuri njye
He did.	Yabikoze.
He seemed very young.	Yasaga naho ari muto cyane.
I did not know	Sinari nzi
You can't find out here.	Ntushobora kumenya hano.
A really long time.	Igihe kinini rwose.
I need to study.	Nkeneye kwiga.
Until things get better.	Kugeza ibintu bizaba byiza.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I know where the money went	Nzi aho amafaranga yagiye
To do it right.	Kubikora neza.
I am very happy for both of them.	Nishimiye cyane bombi.
He wanted to talk to everyone.	Yashakaga kuvuga kuri buri wese.
They are friends.	Ni inshuti.
He was not ready.	Ntiyari yiteguye.
I was in the basement	Nari mu nzu yo hasi
Something of faith.	Ikintu cyo kwizera.
I was not sure you knew	Sinari nzi neza ko wari uzi neza
That we are all.	Ko twese turi.
I didn't know there was so much	Ntabwo nari nzi ko hari byinshi
It was good.	Byari byiza.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
I didn't feel well	Ntabwo numvise neza
I didn’t have the means to help with that	Ntabwo nari mfite uburyo bwo gufasha muri ibyo
He didn't really do it.	Ntabwo rwose yabikoze.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri.
He was not worried.	Ntabwo yari afite impungenge.
We have time.	Dufite igihe.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
I knew it was true	Nari nzi ko ari ukuri
Not us.	Ko twe.
But this time.	Ariko iki gihe.
But it looks good.	Ariko birasa neza.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
My wife did nothing at the time.	Icyo gihe umugore wanjye ntacyo yakoze.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
I don't believe in anything	Nta na kimwe nizera
We were really worried.	Twari dufite impungenge rwose.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, iyo ukora cyane.
He thought that was true.	Yatekereje ko ibyo ari ukuri.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
There is so much to learn and know.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga no kumenya.
That was my plan.	Iyo yari gahunda yanjye.
But it turned out very well	Ariko byagenze neza rwose
I thought about this	Natekereje kuri ibi
The reason is true of what you said.	Impamvu nukuri kubyo wavuze.
If he had any idea what he meant.	Niba afite igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose yashakaga kuvuga.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
Not him or anyone.	Ntabwo ari we cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Friends are friends	Inshuti ni inshuti
Now I can't.	Ubu ntashobora.
I don't want to say that.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga icyo kibazo.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
He wants the worst	Arashaka mubi
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibi ni byiza.
He would not get a job on time.	Ntabwo yari kubona akazi ku gihe.
I feel the same way about you	Ndumva kimwe nawe
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.

This was daily.	Ibi byari buri munsi.
I never thought of this	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza ibi
And you can.	Kandi urashobora.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It's worse than that.	Ari mubi cyane kuruta ibyo.
Sometimes it is not.	Rimwe na rimwe sibyo.
I need to be close to him	Nkeneye kuba hafi ye
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
They were friends.	Bari inshuti.
Good advice	Inama nziza
But you really don't have it.	Ariko ntabwo rwose ufite.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Icyo kibazo ni kimwe mubyukuri.
I could never have lived that way	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kubaho gutya
He didn't know what to do about it.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora kuri ibi.
I didn’t want to do that today	Ntabwo nashakaga kubikora uyu munsi
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
And that was good.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza.
You don't have time.	Ntabwo ufite umwanya.
I don’t think this is a problem	Ntabwo ntekereza ko iki ari ikibazo
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
The best thing for her is her hair.	Ikintu cyiza cyane kuri we ni umusatsi we.
He needed to think clearly.	Yari akeneye gutekereza neza.
So far.	Kugeza kure.
It is not a time.	Ntabwo ari umwanya.
I can do nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora.
I can't think straight	Sinshobora gutekereza neza
You really shouldn't.	Ntugomba rwose.
He has to live.	Agomba kubaho.
I thought about what he said	Natekereje kubyo yavuze
He had to, however.	Yagombaga, ariko.
I'm glad to go.	Nishimiye kugenda.
I really didn't know he had it	Mubyukuri sinari nzi ko afite
I can't see what happened.	Sinshobora kubona uko byagenze.
However, there is much to that.	Ariko, hariho byinshi kuri ibyo.
I'm behind him.	Ndi inyuma ye.
He didn't need to do it at all.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kubikora na gato.
I made money, but not enough	Nabonye amafaranga, ariko ntabwo bihagije
He asked.	Yasabye.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
But you can't say.	Ariko ntushobora kuvuga.
I was definitely not happy	Rwose sinari nishimiye
I hadn’t thought much of it	Ntabwo nari natekereje cyane
I am above you and in you.	Ndi hejuru yawe kandi muri wowe.
I don't know what to see	Sinzi icyo mbona
Or at all times.	Cyangwa igihe cyose.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
I like being around you here	Nkunda kuba hafi yawe hano
I can't say for sure	Ntabwo nshobora kuvuga nabi na gato
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
We don't need food.	Ntabwo dukeneye ibiryo.
Since then	Kuva icyo gihe.
I know you saw it	Nzi ko wabonye
I didn’t want to know any of that	Sinifuzaga kumenya kimwe muri ibyo
He had that thing.	Yari afite icyo kintu.
None of us had an idea.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari ufite igitekerezo.
I didn’t know what to think about this	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza kuri ibi
That is true of me.	Ibyo ni ukuri kuri njye.
He had time.	Yari afite umwanya.
I know what he looks like	Nzi uko asa
But it’s not just about living together.	Ariko ntabwo ari kubana gusa.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I should do better or better	Nkwiye gukora neza cyangwa byiza
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane
I'm really out.	Nukuri ndi hanze.
I needed someone in front of me	Nari nkeneye umuntu imbere yanjye
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I think the idea is too small.	Ntekereza ko igitekerezo ari gito cyane.
I had a job.	Nari mfite akazi.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
I can't think of anything right now	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza neza na gato muri iki gihe
I knew his wife was right	Nari nzi ko umugore we afite ukuri
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko wabikoze wenyine.
I don't think that's possible.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka.
Stop being alone.	Reka kureka kuba wenyine.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
Eventually, he looked away.	Amaherezo, yarebye kure.
We have to do what we have.	Tugomba gukora ibyo dufite.
I hope they have a dog	Nizere ko bafite imbwa
I like movies	Nkunda firime
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
It was not good for me.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri njye.
Much of that is possible.	Byinshi muri byo bishoboka.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane nibyo
I'm glad he's gone.	Nishimiye ko yagiye.
I guess that's what you saw.	Ndakeka ko aribyo wabonye.
Or you can't.	Cyangwa ntushobora.
I am.	Ndi we.
I know what you want	Nzi icyo ushaka
And he had done nothing.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe yari yakoze.
They were already very close.	Mbere bari hafi cyane.
I can't do less time than this	Ntabwo nshobora gukora umwanya muto kurenza iyi
But where ?.	Ariko ari he?.
You are watching how you do.	Urimo kureba uko ukora.
But he did come.	Ariko yaje rwose.
And he really doesn't do anything.	Kandi mubyukuri ntacyo akora.
We had a winning car.	Twari dufite imodoka yo gutsinda.
I can get an idea and a quick look	Nshobora kubona igitekerezo hamwe no kureba vuba
I hope he will be one	Ndizera ko azaba umwe
I want to go back soon	Ndashaka gusubira vuba
And he is.	Kandi ari.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Tell me everything	Mbwira byose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I think maybe everyone is the same book	Ntekereza ko ahari bose ari igitabo kimwe
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
I never did that	Sinigeze nkora ibyo
I don't know what happened to that	Sinzi uko byagenze muri ibyo
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ndi ibyo ariko cyane cyane.
That is not a good time.	Icyo ntabwo ari igihe cyiza.
I didn't know what he meant to me	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga kumbwira
You were a very small family.	Wari umuryango muto cyane.
Everyone has money.	Umuntu wese afite amafaranga.
I can't think of it right now	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri ubu
That top is good.	Iyo hejuru ni byiza.
I do everything I do	Nkora ibyo nkora byose
I'm not sure they would do that today.	Sinzi neza ko bari kubikora uyu munsi.
I saw nothing, I just heard	Ntacyo nabonye, ​​numva gusa
I didn't get the time	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya
I was not a woman.	Ntabwo nari umugore.
I always thought this was over	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko ibi byari hejuru
I heard he had a daughter	Numvise ko afite umukobwa
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I should have done my hair	Nari nkwiye gukora umusatsi wanjye
And he's gone now.	Kandi yagiye ubu.
I did not know his problem	Sinari nzi ikibazo cye
I don't know what you look like.	Sinzi uko usa.
I never saw him like that.	Sinigeze mbona nka we.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I was a good person.	Nari umuntu mwiza.
And you don’t have to.	Kandi ntugomba.
He wanted to go back.	Yashakaga gusubira inyuma.
I don't think that's possible.	Ntabwo mbona ko bishoboka.
All of us.	Twese.
I was close to him at the time	Icyo gihe nari hafi ye
I had many friends	Nari mfite inshuti nyinshi
I really have to go	Ngomba rwose kugenda
It was not just a matter of time.	Ntabwo byari ibintu gusa.
I've been wanting it ever since	Nashakaga cyane kuva aho
Being a woman.	Kuba umugore.
He wants to know everything.	Ashaka kumenya byose.
He says nothing.	Nta cyo avuga.
I was not going to go back	Ntabwo nari ngiye gusubira inyuma
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
I haven’t thought about much so far	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri byinshi kugeza ubu
Like me	Nkanjye.
I got a lot to learn	Nabonye byinshi byo kwiga

We were all.	Twese twari.
He had something good.	Yari afite ikintu cyiza.
I can't talk to anyone	Sinshobora kuvugana n'umwe
Sometimes, you can even win.	Rimwe na rimwe, ushobora no gutsinda.
And you can.	Kandi urashobora.
He had said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yavuze.
Probably later.	Birashoboka ko nyuma.
And that was not enough.	Kandi ntabwo byari bihagije.
Eventually, he asked to return.	Amaherezo, yasabye gutaha.
But they have a problem.	Ariko bafite ikibazo.
But now, we have.	Ariko ubu, dufite.
I like to look here	Nkunda kureba hano
I can eat almost everything	Nshobora kurya hafi ya byose
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
I was not sure of the truth.	Sinari nzi neza ukuri.
I thought of having a family	Natekerezaga kugira umuryango
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.
I want to know the truth	Ndashaka kumenya ukuri
I'm glad he was here tonight	Nishimiye ko yari hano muri iri joro
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Before you do anything else.	Mbere yo gukora ikindi kintu.

He did not know what he would get.	Ntiyari azi icyo yari kubona.
A very long time.	Igihe kinini cyane.
She just wanted to be with him.	Yashakaga gusa kubana na we.
I did everything he told me to do	Nakoze ibyo yambwiye byose
I can't say right now	Sinshobora kuvuga nonaha
I needed a regular look while I was doing it	Nari nkeneye kureba bisanzwe mugihe ndimo kubikora
I need to know the truth	Nkeneye kumenya ukuri
I can stay longer if you want to come now	Nshobora kuguma igihe kirekire niba ushaka kuza nonaha
At all times	Igihe cyose.
He said he was alone.	Yavuze ko yari wenyine.
The problem is me.	Ikibazo ni njye.
I think it will	Ntekereza ko bizaba
I didn't know how to go back	Ntabwo nari nzi gusubira inyuma
He did not know exactly what that was.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo.
From there.	Kuva aho.
But it is not very difficult.	Ariko ntabwo bigoye cyane.
I should be scared.	Nkwiye kugira ubwoba.
They were many.	Bari benshi.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
He had a way of winning.	Yari afite uburyo bwo gutsinda.
This is his opinion.	Iki ni igitekerezo cye.
Nothing for me.	Ntacyo kuri njye.
I had a good plan.	Nari mfite gahunda nziza.
'	'
There are many things we need to know.	Hariho ibintu byinshi tugomba kumenya.
But my family is not.	Ariko umuryango wanjye sibyo.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atagomba.
I should not be afraid	Ntabwo nkwiye kugira ubwoba
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
I didn't know that	Sinari nzi icyo
We weren’t close enough.	Ntabwo twari hafi bihagije.
He talks about this.	Avuga kuri ibi.
Sometimes, sometimes, you can talk.	Rimwe na rimwe, rimwe na rimwe, urashobora kuvuga.
You have to do something.	Ugomba kugira icyo ukora.
I think he's gone though	Ndatekereza ko yagiye ariko
It was good.	Byari byiza.
My beautiful son.	Umuhungu wanjye mwiza.
It's normal.	Ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I don’t even think about going home.	Ntatekereza no gutaha.
I have the same problem.	Nanjye mfite icyo kibazo.
I want to be your wife	Ndashaka kuba umugore wawe
The truth.	Ukuri.
I have to do what he says	Ngomba gukora ibyo avuga
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
I didn't need to talk to you	Sinari nkeneye kuvugana nawe
He was not a dog.	Ntabwo yari imbwa.
That he should not do it.	Ko atagomba kubikora.
Anything but what he has to do.	Ikintu cyose ariko icyo agomba gukora.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
It is not very high.	Ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
I like to do it.	Nkunda kubikora.
I feel we can be good friends	Ndumva dushobora kuba inshuti nziza
He didn't have to live.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubaho.
I should go back	Nkwiye gusubira inyuma
I know you and I are close	Nzi ko wowe na we bari hafi
I think it's good	Ntekereza ko ari byiza
He is here later.	Ari hano nyuma.
And that was true.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri.
I have never done anything wrong.	Sinigeze nkora ikintu kibi.
I didn’t want to think about school today	Sinifuzaga gutekereza ku ishuri muri iki gihe
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
One person said it would be a problem.	Umuntu umwe yavuze ko bizaba ikibazo.
I guess so is he	Ndakeka ko na we ari
As if that is the case.	Nkaho niba aribyo.
I need to give up everything	Nkeneye kureka ibintu byose
Not good for me.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
For me, it was really easy.	Kuri njye byari byoroshye rwose kubikora.
Eventually, he was ready.	Amaherezo, yari yiteguye.
I mean, how.	Ndashaka kuvuga, uko.
And he knows what to do.	Kandi azi icyo gukora.
I know what would happen	Nzi uko byari kugenda
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
Or stop one of them.	Cyangwa guhagarika kimwe muri byo.
That's not the problem right now.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo ubu.
Good friends as usual	Inshuti nziza nkuko bisanzwe
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
He was very young.	Yari akiri muto cyane.
I guess we just have to get it	Ndakeka ko tugomba kubona gusa
I have to say something.	Ngomba kuvuga ikintu.
You can't help it.	Ntushobora gufasha.
There is a time.	Hariho igihe.
This will be the same.	Ibi bizaba kimwe.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
You really have to find a dog.	Ugomba kubona imbwa rwose.
I mean, it's true, but it's not true.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko aribyo, ariko sibyo.
At one point he had nothing to say.	Igihe kimwe ntacyo yari afite cyo kuvuga.
And that was down.	Kandi ibyo byari hasi.
He was not here yesterday or today.	Ntabwo yari hano ejo cyangwa uyu munsi.
I wanted to know what they knew	Nashakaga kumenya ibyo bazi
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He wants to.	Ashaka ko.
We have one guy downstairs.	Dufite umusore umwe hasi.
The above is obviously good.	Hejuru biragaragara ko ari byiza.
It is very likely that he was present.	Birashoboka cyane ko yaba ahari.
This is a mistake.	Ibi ni amakosa.
But he was an expert.	Ariko yari umuhanga.
It would be nice if that was the case.	Byari kuba byiza iyo aribyo.
I never saw a problem	Nta kibazo nigeze mbona
I can't give up	Sinshobora kureka
That's great	Nibyiza cyane
That would be a good thing for me.	Ibi byaba ari ibintu byiza kuri njye.
He was not alone.	Ntiyari wenyine.
I've seen it done before.	Nabonye abikora mbere.
I actually saw a lot of it.	Mubyukuri nabonye byinshi cyane.
I thought that was what everyone should be looking for	Natekerezaga ko aribyo buri wese agomba gushaka
He never liked it.	Ntabwo yigeze akunda.
Come on.	Hasi.
I didn't want to go home	Sinifuzaga gutaha
I thought you were just a human being	Natekerezaga ko uri umuntu gusa
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi uko ni ko byagenze.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He has to leave this house.	Agomba kuva muri iyi nzu.
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
It's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He probably needed a drink.	Birashoboka ko yari akeneye kunywa.
Everyone needs to stay away.	Umuntu wese akeneye kuguma kure.
Apparently not him.	Biragaragara ko atari we.
That’s not what a good girl does.	Ntabwo ari ibintu umukobwa mwiza akora.
I want to stay here with you	Ndashaka kuguma hano hamwe nawe
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
He did not need to think for long.	Ntabwo yari akeneye gutekereza igihe kirekire.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
I just can't figure it out	Gusa sinshobora kumenya uko
I don't want to know who he is.	Sinshaka kumenya uwo ari we.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
They weren't here tonight.	Ntabwo bari hano muri iri joro.
I can't believe he is	Sinshobora kwizera ko ari we
You do what you have to do.	Ukora ibyo ugomba gukora.
The house was not ready.	Inzu ntiyari yiteguye.
There is a long time.	Hari igihe kirekire.
That's great.	Ibyo ni byiza cyane.
But it is.	Ariko ni.
He was here.	Yari hano.
Someone asked why.	Umuntu yabajije impamvu yo kubikora.
He needed money.	Yari akeneye amafaranga.
I need to know something	Nkeneye kumenya ikintu
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
A very intelligent child.	Umwana ufite ubwenge rwose.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
I was very lucky.	Nagize amahirwe cyane.
I really needed it from there	Nari nkeneye rwose kuva aho
I needed to talk to him	Nari nkeneye kuvugana na we
Or something good.	Cyangwa ikintu cyiza.
That's all there is to it.	Ibyo bishoboka byose.
In the end, it turned out to be a success.	Amaherezo, birashoboka ko byagenze neza.
It's scary.	Ni ubwoba.
You have to find faith	Ugomba kubona kwizera
And very young.	Kandi muto cyane.
I wanted to be an actor	Nashakaga kuba umukinnyi
The problem is true.	Ikibazo ni ukuri.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
I just need to know what you said.	Nkeneye gusa kumenya ibyo wavuze.
I was not sure why.	Sinari nzi neza impamvu.
But that was good for me	Ariko ibyo byari byiza kuri njye
I know they are in this world	Nzi ko bari kuri iyi si
He needed to be alone.	Yari akeneye kuba wenyine.
Above and beyond.	Hejuru na.
I can't see the problem	Sinshobora kubona icyo kibazo
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
When is the best time to play?	Ni ryari igihe cyiza cyo gukina.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
I just can't believe he's gone	Gusa sinshobora kwizera ko yagiye
I think this is good	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza
You have to.	Ugomba nawe.
You can't tell exactly what it is.	Ntushobora kumenya neza icyo aricyo.
I need to go home now, not later	Nkeneye gutaha nonaha, ntabwo nyuma
No need to think.	Nta mpamvu yo gutekereza.
I thought it was good for that	Natekerezaga ko ari byiza kuri ibyo
He has it all or alone.	Afite byose cyangwa wenyine.
I would go	Nari kugenda
The party would be great.	Ibirori byaba byiza cyane.
He was the right person	Yari umuntu ukwiye
They didn’t really have an idea.	Ntabwo rwose bari bafite igitekerezo.
It will be a while.	Bizaba igihe gito.
I was not sure what to do	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora
I want to be with you all the time	Ndashaka kubana nawe igihe cyose
I'm really glad to be here	Nishimiye rwose kuba ndi hano
I was going to see this	Nari ngiye kubona ibi
And he meant.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga.
I was not sure when	Sinari nzi neza igihe
I want to stay here	Ndashaka kuguma hano
Not everyone knows everything.	Ntabwo abantu bose bazi ibintu byose.
But together.	Ariko hamwe na hamwe.
It's something you don't want to do.	Ni ikintu udashaka gukora.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's really possible.	Nibyo rwose birashoboka.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
He was just one guy with an idea.	Yari umusore umwe gusa ufite igitekerezo.
Most likely, this room.	Birashoboka cyane, iki cyumba.
He was never ashamed.	Ntiyigeze agira isoni.
I don't know where.	Sinzi aho.
Who can speak.	Ninde ushobora kuvuga.
I have no faith.	Ntacyo nizera.
I didn't get the idea	Ntabwo nabonye igitekerezo
I hope you were a good person before	Ndizera ko wari umuntu mwiza mbere
I like it easy.	Nkunda byoroshye.
This is true.	Uyu ni ukuri.
I thought it was good before.	Natekereje ko mbere byari byiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Being out here.	Kuba hanze aha.
In the morning, he.	Mu gitondo, we.
He thought he would wait for this.	Yatekereje ko yari gutegereza ibi.
I can't find a way to do this.	Sinshobora kubona uburyo bwo gukora ibi.
I should have done it sooner	Nari nkwiye gukora vuba
I mean bad	Ndashaka kuvuga nabi
And he has.	Kandi afite.
Now I can’t talk to everyone	Ubu sinshobora kuvuga abantu bose
He can't be working.	Ntashobora kuba akora.
Nowhere.	Nta na hamwe.
But one has to go far.	Ariko umuntu agomba kujya kure.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
But not until then.	Ariko si kugeza icyo gihe.
I like to live with him.	Nkunda kubana na we.
I mean, it's you.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko uri wowe.
I didn't really want to live	Sinifuzaga rwose kubaho
She is not the only girl.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa umwe.
I would not eat anything	Ntacyo nari kurya
She needs help.	Akeneye ubufasha.
They have the truth.	Bafite ukuri.
I still don't know what he means	Kugeza ubu sinzi icyo ashaka kuvuga
He always wanted to know more.	Buri gihe yashakaga kumenya byinshi.
I was not afraid.	Ntabwo nagize ubwoba.
He was a very good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza cyane.
And before anyone can say a word.	Kandi mbere yuko umuntu agira icyo avuga.
I'm sure he went to talk.	Nzi neza ko yagiye kuvugana.
He was young, probably thirty.	Yari akiri muto, ahari mirongo itatu.
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
One of us has to go.	Umwe muri twe agomba kugenda.
He wanted to go home.	Yashakaga gutaha.
He had many close friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi hafi.
They both deal with their confidence as they choose to embark on their play activities	Bombi bafite ubwenge bwo kubikora
I just wanted to know what it was	Nashakaga gusa kumenya icyo aricyo
He never did.	Ntabwo yigeze akora.
.	.
I had no choice	Ntabwo nari mfite uburyo
I felt good at the time	Icyo gihe numvise neza
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
You have to leave the house.	Ugomba kuva mu nzu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The first actor of the film.	Umukinnyi wa mbere wa firime.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
That would do it.	Ibyo byari kubikora.
I wonder why we are here	Ndabaza impamvu turi hano
It's just you and me.	Ni wowe na njye gusa.
But now there is no going.	Ariko ubu nta kugenda.
He says he didn't.	Avuga ko atabikoze.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi rwose ni ko byagenze.
I can take a lot	Nshobora gufata byinshi
But he is.	Ariko ni we.
No one.	Nta muntu.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I knew nothing about him	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri we
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
It was a good idea	Byari igitekerezo cyiza
You are.	Urimo.
I also wanted to leave	Nashakaga no kuva aho
'	'
He will be, not the way he thinks.	Azaba, ntabwo ari uburyo atekereza.
I don't know what it is	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo
I can't be this person	Sinshobora kuba uyu muntu
Much more than he wanted to think	Byinshi kurenza uko yashakaga gutekereza
He didn't have time to do it.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo kubikora.
That would be close to me.	Ibyo byari kuba hafi yanjye.
It was better than the movie.	Byari byiza kuruta firime.
I did not know at the time	Sinari nzi icyo gihe
He is not going.	Ntabwo agenda.
It is a gift that no one wants.	Ndi impano umuntu adashaka.
I needed to go find a phone	Nari nkeneye kujya gushaka terefone
I know what you think now.	Nzi icyo utekereza ubu.
It's good.	Ndi mwiza.
I can't go back now	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma ubu
I mean, really	Ndashaka kuvuga ko mubyukuri
I should have been closer	Nari nkwiye kuba hafi
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
It was really my fault.	Nukuri byari amakosa yanjye.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
I think he is right	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
The money had gone.	Amafaranga yari yagiye.
Or that.	Cyangwa ibyo.
I understand that	Ndumva ibyo aribyo
Not only that.	Ntabwo ari ibi gusa.
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri
He didn't know how to do it.	Ntiyari azi kubikora.
But we have something else to do now.	Ariko dufite ikindi kintu cyo gukora ubu.
He was a dog.	Yari imbwa.
He was not going.	Ntabwo yari agiye.
I thought he wanted to tell me something, but he couldn't	Natekereje ko ashaka kumbwira ikintu, ariko ntashobora
It's good to have you here.	Nibyiza kuba ufite hano.
He looked frightened.	Yarebye afite ubwoba.
I'm not out.	Ntabwo ndi hanze.
I want to be good enough	Ndashaka kuba mwiza bihagije
I saw something in front of you	Nabonye ikintu imbere yawe
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
I think we should go	Ndatekereza ko tugomba kugenda
You can't.	Ntushobora.
I make a movie.	Nkora firime.
You do nothing.	Ntacyo ukora.
We are close to you.	Turi hafi yawe.
For now, you have to come first.	Kuri ubu, ugomba kuza mbere.
He went.	Yagiye.
I didn't want help	Sinifuzaga ubufasha
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I had no plans	Ntabwo nari mfite gahunda
There are people here.	Hano hari abantu.
I think this is a time to try.	Ntekereza ko uyu ari umwanya wo kugerageza.
I have a small problem.	Mfite ikibazo gito.
I love your hair.	Nkunda umusatsi wawe.
I just didn't think so	Gusa sinigeze ntekereza ko aribyo
'	'
They are just scared.	Bafite ubwoba gusa.
He always does well.	Buri gihe akora neza.
Not very good, but that's right.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane, ariko nibyo.
I don't know what happened	Sinzi uko byagenze
But things went well.	Ariko ibintu byagenze neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
I wouldn't know anything.	Ntabwo nari kumenya ikintu.
I’ve seen a lot of that	Nabonye byinshi muri byo
You don't know for sure.	Ntabwo uzi neza.
I never heard of it either	Nanjye sinigeze numva
That was difficult	Ibyo byari bigoye
He got the chance.	Yabonye amahirwe.
I am looking for a girl.	Ndashaka umukobwa.
He was in front of me.	Yari imbere yanjye.
This was a great plan.	Iyi yari gahunda nziza.
I want him to go	Ndashaka ko agenda
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
Arimo.	Arimo.
His clothes.	Imyenda ye.
I don't know what.	Sinzi icyo.
But that is true.	Ariko uko ni ukuri.
You are one of us now.	Uri umwe muri twe ubu.
That's not the problem.	Icyo si cyo kibazo.
He tried to help.	Yagerageje gufasha.
He wants to go to the house.	Ashaka kujya mu nzu.
He thought I needed to get out of here	Yatekereje ko nkeneye kuva hano
Just a nice car.	Imodoka nziza gusa.
I'm glad he's gone	Nishimiye ko yagiye
He could see nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We have to see.	Tugomba kubona.
And we all have that.	Kandi twese dufite ibyo.
They are not children.	Ntabwo ari abana.
I'm not going.	Ntabwo ngiye.
It's all about it.	Byose kuri yo.
I want to hear that we are one person	Ndashaka kumva ko turi umuntu umwe
I want to help a lot	Ndashaka gufasha cyane
It's the same with him.	Birasa na we.
I think you are too	Ndatekereza ko nawe uri
This was in the same house.	Iyi yari murugo rimwe.
So far, it is possible.	Kugeza ubu, birashoboka.
It was easy to get along well	Nari byoroshye kubana neza
He was just a boy.	Yari umuhungu gusa.
He probably had a reason.	Birashoboka ko yari afite impamvu.
I saw it all, but I was not here	Nabonye byose, ariko ntabwo nari hano
I have seen many.	Nabonye benshi.
Absolutely, absolutely.	Akazi rwose, rwose.
In fact, it's really good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
I think that's something else	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ikindi kintu
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
He said it was good, good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza, byiza.
He is here.	Ari hano.
Everyone wants things.	Umuntu wese arashaka ibintu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko abikora.
I can't say this	Sinshobora kuvuga kuri ibi
I am very happy with what happened.	Nishimiye cyane uko byagenze.
He had.	Yari afite.
I wonder why we are here	Ndabaza impamvu turi hano
And he had a reason to be both.	Kandi yari afite impamvu yo kuba bombi.
Not that there is much to do.	Ntabwo ari uko hari byinshi byo gukora.
He would not understand.	Ntiyari kumva.
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kugenda
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
That was my guy.	Uwo yari umusore wanjye.
I did well.	Nakoze neza.
Probably the only one he ever saw.	Birashoboka ko ari we wenyine yigeze kubona.
He has everything he needs.	Afite ibyo akeneye byose.
There is one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe.
He was close to everything	Yari hafi ya byose
I guess so	Ndakeka ko aribyo
I needed money.	Nari nkeneye amafaranga.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
I didn’t have to look up	Sinari nkwiye kureba hejuru
You had everything you wanted.	Wari ufite ibyo ushaka byose.
It's not as good as mine.	Ntabwo ari byiza nkanjye.
I need to talk to you alone	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe wenyine
Your family is a great asset to me.	Umuryango wawe ni ikintu cyiza kuri njye.
Stop trying to do too much.	Reka kugerageza gukora byinshi.
I have a food problem	Mfite ikibazo cyo kurya
I know what you saw.	Nzi ibyo wabonye.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I wanted to say something to look at	Nashakaga kuvuga ikintu cyo kureba
But he is gone now.	Ariko yagiye ubu.
They both had.	Bombi bari bafite.
He did not know the truth well.	Ntiyari azi neza ukuri.
I want this above	Ndashaka ibi hejuru
I'm not sure why	Sinzi neza impamvu
I want to know more about it	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi kuri byo
A girl can be too much.	Umukobwa ushobora kuba byinshi cyane.
I didn't know he bought a car	Sinari nzi ko yaguze imodoka
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
I want to be with you one day	Ndashaka kubana nawe umunsi umwe
I can't go	Ntabwo nshobora kugenda
I want to know what happened.	Ndashaka kumenya uko byagenze.
I can't figure out who the girl is	Sinshobora kumenya umukobwa urimo
He never said anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze avuga.
He must have.	Agomba kugira.
At the time, I knew he was right	Icyo gihe nari nzi ko yavuze ukuri
So far I have no time to do this	Kugeza ubu ntabwo mfite umwanya wo gukora ibi
I never had to.	Sinigeze ngomba.
He did things as he went	Yakoze ibintu uko agenda
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
We were close.	Twari hafi.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
I hope he was a really good guy	Ndizera ko yari umusore mwiza rwose
And that would be it.	Kandi ibyo byaba aribyo.
It's down.	Bari hasi.
Lots of food.	Ibiryo byinshi.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
It's bad, no problem.	Ari mubi nta kibazo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I want to go to work	Ndashaka kujya ku kazi
I can drive later	Nshobora gutwara nyuma
We had a house.	Twari dufite inzu.
I knew why	Nari nzi impamvu ye
True, if not true	Ukuri, niba atari ukuri
The fact that we all have to live together	Ukuri ko twese tugomba kubana
The baby came to where I was.	Umwana yaje aho ndi.
I didn’t have much to do	Ntabwo nari mfite byinshi byo gukora
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It is not his house.	Ntabwo ari inzu ye.
Someone did wrong	Umuntu yakoze nabi
I need help here.	Nkeneye ubufasha hano.
I never did anything	Nta kintu na kimwe nigeze nkora
You should have seen what he did yesterday.	Wari ukwiye kubona ibyo yakoze ejo.
Everyone has one.	Umuntu wese afite umwe.
I can't think of one	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza kuri kimwe
We.	Ni.
I knew that	Nari nzi ko aribyo
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
I definitely saw that	Nabonye rwose ko aribyo
He is alone.	Ni wenyine.
I just didn't get the chance	Gusa sinigeze mbona amahirwe yo
All in all, really.	Byose, mubyukuri.
You always want to do the right thing.	Buri gihe ushaka gukora ikintu cyiza.
I'm really worried	Mfite impungenge rwose
Everything in fact.	Ibintu byose mubyukuri.
I want to talk to you more	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe byinshi
That's right.	Nukuri.
That was difficult.	Ibyo byari bigoye.
Only if we are lucky, that's right.	Gusa niba dufite amahirwe, nibyo.
It will be.	Bizaba.
Or maybe it’s not a chance.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari amahirwe.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
At the time, I didn't think much of it	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekereje cyane
I needed something else	Nari nkeneye ikindi kintu
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I want you to be in me.	Ndashaka ko uri muri njye.
He did this	Ibi yabikoze
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
I didn’t even know who he was	Sinari nzi mbere uwo ari we
There is a small problem.	Hariho ikibazo gito.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
There is a lot to say.	Hariho byinshi byo kuvuga.
Sometimes that is not the case.	Rimwe na rimwe ntabwo aribyo.
I'm sure I believe	Nzi neza ko nizera
I heard recently	Numvise vuba aha
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was not what he wanted.	Ntabwo yari icyo yashakaga.
He knows nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe azi.
I guess he can.	Ndakeka ko ashobora.
He never left early.	Ntiyigeze agenda kare.
Good for everyone.	Nibyiza kuri bose.
I don’t see people every day.	Ntabwo mbona abantu buri munsi.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
I know you have to do this	Nzi ko ugomba gukora ibi
I can't take this anymore	Sinshobora kongera gufata ibi
I have money.	Mfite amafaranga.
But that.	Ariko ibyo.
I think it's a good thing	Ndakeka ko ari ikintu cyiza
I wonder if he is alone.	Ndabaza niba ari wenyine.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I shouldn't be far away.	Ntabwo nkwiye kuba kure.
They were upstairs.	Bari hejuru.
For me, this is good.	Kuri njye, ibi ni byiza.
I didn't want to be with anyone	Sinifuzaga kubana n'umuntu uwo ari we wese
He did.	Yabikoze.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
They have a job.	Bafite akazi.
A little thing.	Ikintu gito.
But that was not the plan.	Ariko iyo ntiyari gahunda.
And fear.	Kandi ubwoba.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
I mean, that's just fine	Ndashaka kuvuga, nibyiza gusa
You have to know the truth.	Ugomba kumenya ukuri.
The other thing is true.	Ikindi kintu ni ukuri.
I want to be in this world.	Ndashaka kuri iyi si.
I can't go back.	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma.
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo.
I have never heard of this	Sinigeze numva ibi
I think he is worried about me	Ntekereza ko afite impungenge kuri njye
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
You can't stay with me.	Ntushobora kuguma hamwe nanjye.
I just don’t get the idea to try it.	Ntabwo gusa mbona igitekerezo cyo kugerageza.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
It’s in my schedule.	Ni muri gahunda yanjye.
I can do it easily	Nshobora kubikora byoroshye
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I can't even live with him	Sinshobora no kubana na we
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
He needs someone.	Akeneye umuntu.
That would be true.	Ibyo byari kuba aribyo.
Work is possible.	Akazi birashoboka.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza kubona.
So far, that has not been the case.	Kugeza ubu, ntabwo byagenze neza.
Really, people.	Nukuri, abantu.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Mubyukuri nibyo byoroshye.
He has that.	Afite ibyo.
And it's big.	Kandi ni kinini.
I was scared	Nari mfite ubwoba
Nothing went wrong.	Nta kintu na kimwe yagiye.
That was the reason.	Iyo yari impamvu.
I have to look up	Ngomba kureba hejuru
Everyone knows what happened.	Abantu bose bazi uko byagenze.
I thought you might be	Natekereje ko ushobora kuba
I was just going to talk	Nari ngiye kuvuga gusa
Especially together at the top.	Cyane cyane hamwe hejuru.
There is a chance here.	Hano hari amahirwe.
I need to learn more	Nkeneye kwiga byinshi
I only have one problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I know it was good	Nzi ko byari byiza
However, he must do one or the other.	Ariko, agomba gukora kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
We don't need to talk about it right now.	Ntabwo dukeneye kuvuga kuri ubu.
But he.	Ariko we.
He feels like a good guy.	Yumva ari umusore mwiza.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
And there is something wrong.	Kandi hariho ikintu kibi.
You are good people.	Muri abantu neza.
But no problem.	Ariko nta kibazo.
But that's just me.	Ariko ibyo ni njye gusa.
This is a problem.	Iki ni ikibazo.
I thought the same	Natekerezaga kimwe
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, yaba ari hafi.
I was a very, very, very bad boy	Nari umuhungu cyane, cyane, mubi cyane
I was well aware	Nari nzi neza
You don't have to say anything else.	Ntugomba kuvuga ikindi.
I can't have this	Ntabwo nshobora kugira ibi
He said something.	Hari icyo yavuze.
I'm not a bad person	Ntabwo ndi umuntu mubi
And that's not a bad thing.	Kandi si ikintu kibi.
I feel very loved	Ndumva nkunda cyane
I just hope it's a good movie.	Gusa nizere ko ari firime nziza.
Obviously not a good thing.	Biragaragara ko atari ibintu byiza.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
But you have to act fast.	Ariko ugomba gukora vuba.
I think he really did go	Ntekereza ko yagiye rwose
Is that right 	Nibyo?
I feel things on.	Ndumva ibintu kuri.
I can't talk to him right now	Sinshobora kuvugana na we muri iki gihe
You can also go.	Urashobora kandi kugenda.
It is not a book.	Ntabwo ari igitabo.
I was in the house	Nari mu nzu
However, he did not sit well.	Ariko, ntabwo yicaye neza.
I had it now.	Nari mfite ubu.
I can see someone tomorrow	Nshobora kubona umuntu ejo
When everything is plentiful.	Iyo ibintu byose ari byinshi.
I'm in it, now.	Ndi muri yo, ubu.
I heard someone behind me	Numvise umuntu inyuma yanjye
I never saw him go.	Sinigeze mbona agenda.
I heard it all.	Numvise byose.
He could hear both.	Yashoboraga kumva bombi.
I saw all this	Nabonye ibi byose
And that is good for me.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza kuri njye.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
, together.	, hamwe hamwe.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
I think it will be good	Ndakeka ko bizaba byiza
It looks good	Birasa neza
With the movie.	Hamwe na firime.
Leave tomorrow.	Kureka ejo.
I did not know who he was.	Ntabwo nari nzi uwo ari we.
I can't wait any longer	Sinshobora gutegereza ikindi gihe
I didn't know what to think, or say	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza, cyangwa kuvuga
I hope he heard a lot	Ndizera ko yumvise byinshi
And that is it.	Kandi ibyo aribyo.
I just had a little problem	Gusa nagize ikibazo gito
Or for each of us.	Cyangwa kuri buri wese muri twe.
He has been working ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe akora.
I was really lucky	Nagize amahirwe rwose
I have to do the same.	Nanjye ngomba kubikora.
He needed to take a closer look.	Yari akeneye kureba neza.
I think that's all	Ndatekereza ko aribyo byose
You saw the problem.	Wabonye ikibazo.
The back was down.	Inyuma yari hasi.
I saw everything in front of me	Nabonye byose imbere yanjye
No one has ever done anything.	Nta muntu wigeze akora ikintu.
I want to work	Ndashaka gukora
She may have had a baby by now.	Birashoboka ko yari afite umwana kugeza ubu.
I want to know what it is	Ndashaka kumenya icyo aricyo
I knew it was there	Nari nzi ko hariho ariko
I feel it is my fault	Ndumva ari amakosa yanjye
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
None of us have.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ufite.
So far, good.	Kugeza ubu, neza.
It was not good at all.	Ntabwo byari byiza na gato.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
I thought about it	Natekereje kuri iki kibazo
I was not sure where I was	Ntabwo nari nzi neza aho ndi
I was in and out of prison a lot	Nari muri gereza no hanze cyane
You should ask for help.	Ugomba gusaba ubufasha.
Great thing.	Ikintu kinini.
There is one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe.
I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva.
I need time to think	Ndashaka umwanya wo gutekereza
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
I'm not here to win	Ntabwo ndi hano gutsinda
Maybe he should go.	Ahari agomba kugenda.
Ari na.	Ari na.
He was not worried.	Ntiyari afite impungenge.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
The back is nice.	Inyuma ni nziza.
I don't know what happened now.	Sinzi uko byagenze ubu.
Think about it.	Utekereza ku mirongo.
I can't really say enough about everything	Ntabwo rwose nshobora kuvuga bihagije kuri buri kintu cyose
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
He is alone.	Ari kuri we wenyine.
He was not.	Ntiyari arimo.
I never saw him want something so much.	Sinigeze mbona ashaka ikintu cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
Or how.	Cyangwa uburyo.
There is money.	Hariho amafaranga.
I didn’t want to know more.	Sinifuzaga kumenya byinshi.
He didn't mean to offend anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga, nta muntu n'umwe.
They were one.	Bari umwe.
I can't think straight.	Sinshobora gutekereza neza.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
Maybe they had.	Birashoboka ko bari bafite.
He was at home.	Yari murugo.
But he does the normal thing.	Ariko akora ibintu bisanzwe.
I am a player.	Ndi umukinnyi.
I don't know how to do it.	Sinzi uburyo bwo kubikora.
The top is good.	Hejuru ni byiza.
One must, but not one.	Umuntu agomba, ariko ntabwo ari we.
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri ibyo
We are in the same school.	Turi mu ishuri rimwe.
I need to believe you can do it	Nkeneye kwizera ko ushobora kubikora
I have a problem though	Mfite ikibazo ariko
I thought he must have a problem	Natekereje ko agomba kuba afite ikibazo
I think things are too complicated	Ntekereza ko ibintu bigoye ari byinshi cyane
I thought, maybe just over thirty	Natekereje, ahari hejuru ya mirongo itatu gusa
You don’t have to look too much.	Ntugomba kureba cyane.
I know it's small	Nzi ko ari gito
You don't know what he feels tonight.	Ntabwo uzi icyo yumva muri iri joro.
I wanted to say something but I don’t know what	Nashakaga kuvuga ikintu ariko sinzi icyo
I heard something like	Numvise ikintu nka
There is more to it.	Hariho byinshi kuri byo.
That would be a good thing for him, he said.	Byaba ari ikibazo cyiza kuri we, yavuze.
This was it.	Ibi byari.
I thought to myself, finally	Natekereje muri njye, amaherezo
I didn’t think that was possible	Sinatekerezaga ko ibyo bishoboka
I never saw this	Sinigeze mbona ibi
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekereje cyane kuri byo
I didn't know how to get food.	Sinari nzi uburyo bwo kubona ibiryo.
I should have seen something	Nari nkwiye kubona ikintu
I know she felt embarrassed	Nzi ko yumvise afite isoni
The boy was right.	Umuhungu yari afite ukuri.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gufata.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
Is it possible? 	Birashoboka?
In him he felt fear	Muri we yumvise afite ubwoba
That he was alone.	Ko yari wenyine.
Playing backwards.	Gukina inyuma.
I can't figure out what it is.	Ntashobora kumenya icyo aricyo.
Everything will be fine.	Ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
I feel a lot.	Numva ari byinshi.
I hope he knows what he's doing	Nizere ko azi ibyo akora
Nothing so far.	Nta kintu na kimwe kugeza ubu.
I would do a lot	Nari gukora byinshi
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva na gato
It's the same, it's possible.	Ni kimwe, birashoboka.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I think so	Ntekereza ko aribyo
Now? 	Ubu?
He needed this.	Yari akeneye ibi.
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
I can't live with that	Ntabwo nshobora kubana nibyo
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ntiyari azi ikindi gukora.
I need to do something	Nkeneye kugira icyo nkora
I have a new plan now	Ndi gahunda nshya ubu
It would not be a good thing.	Ntabwo byaba ari ibintu byiza.
I can't let this happen	Sinshobora kureka ibi
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He knew he had to have it.	Yari azi ko agomba kugira.
I have a wife and I	Mfite umugore nanjye
I can't go to jail right now	Sinshobora kujya muri gereza ubu
He was there, that was enough.	Yari ahari, ibyo byari bihagije.
No one has ever done anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze akora ikintu na kimwe.
'	'
You did it.	Wabikoze.
I want to go tomorrow	Ndashaka kugenda ejo
I wanted to stop thinking	Nashakaga kureka gutekereza
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
I think this is a very big deal.	Ntekereza ko iki ari ikintu kinini cyane.
It didn't look like it.	Ntabwo yasaga nkaho.
He is right.	Yaba afite ukuri.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
He is not at work.	Ntabwo ari ku kazi.
Not true here.	Ntabwo ari ukuri hano.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa.
Good baby	Umwana mwiza.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
Not much today.	Ntabwo ari byinshi muri iki gihe.
I want to know what happened.	Ndashaka kumenya uko byagenze.
I had every problem	Nagize ikibazo cyose
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
I was just thinking	Natekerezaga gusa
But you don’t have to.	Ariko ntugomba.
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
But not me.	Ariko ntabwo ari njye.
I think that's all we need.	Ntekereza ko aribyo dukeneye byose.
I could never figure out why.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kumenya impamvu.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
Do it every day.	Gukora buri munsi.
You are not.	Ntabwo uri.
I think this is a good thing.	Ntekereza ko iki ari ikintu cyiza.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
I know you did.	Nzi ko wabikoze.
He was probably scared.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ubwoba.
I shouldn't have come here	Sinari nkwiye kuza hano
Can you tell me why you did it.	Urashobora kumbwira impamvu wabikoze.
Probably not a good idea later.	Birashoboka ko atari igitekerezo cyiza nyuma.
I didn't know much about him	Ntabwo nari nzi byinshi kuri we
I can't say much about it	Sinshobora kuvuga byinshi kuri byo
I feel at home.	Numva ndi murugo.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
Very simple, very good.	Byiza byoroshye, byiza cyane.
The truth is the same.	Ukuri ni kimwe.
I was very bad	Nari ikintu kibi cyane
I shouldn't have gone that far	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugenda gutya
I was going to talk	Nari ngiye kuvuga
I wanted to go from behind.	Nashakaga kuva inyuma.
I would not know and watch.	Ntabwo nari kumenya no kureba.
I didn't know what to believe	Sinari nzi icyo nizera
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
He needed to go.	Yari akeneye kugenda.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
I can't say	Sinshobora kuvuga
He told me he had.	Yambwiye ko afite.
Later.	Nyuma.
Something is, something is.	Ikintu ni, ikintu ni.
I really didn't need it this time	Ntabwo rwose nari nkeneye iki gihe
He had no job.	Nta kazi yari afite.
It's just me.	Ni muri njye gusa.
He could do anything	Yashoboraga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
It was a party.	Byari ibirori.
He was close to her.	Yari hafi ye.
They knew the truth.	Bari bazi ukuri.
I think he wants a friend	Ntekereza ko yifuza inshuti
He wants her to go.	Ashaka ko agenda.
I can go	Nshobora kujyana
He needed to go home.	Yari akeneye gutaha.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
But no one.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
I didn't need to talk	Sinari nkeneye kuvuga
He asked questions.	Yabajije ibibazo.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I still don't know how he did it.	Kugeza ubu sinzi uko yabikoze.
I have a problem too	Nanjye mfite ikibazo
We have a lot to plan.	Dufite byinshi kuri gahunda.
Only a player who works.	Gusa umukinnyi ukora.
A beautiful and absolutely beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza kandi mwiza rwose
I didn't get the time	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya
I understand what he meant	Ndumva icyo yashakaga kuvuga
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byose byari byinshi cyane.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
I was not sure what	Ntabwo nari nzi neza icyo
I want to do good things	Ndashaka gukora ibintu byiza

I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe no kumva ibi byose.
I don't know if it's behind me	Ntabwo nzi niba ari inyuma yanjye
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
She is very happy to be with him, now.	Yishimiye cyane kubana na we, ubu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
He did nothing.	Ntiyigeze agira icyo akora.
And for a long time.	Kandi igihe kirekire.
We have the opportunity to do something else.	Dufite amahirwe yo gukora ikindi kintu.
That's probably why we were good friends.	Nibyo birashoboka ko twari inshuti nziza.
He was upstairs.	Yari hejuru.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
Back then, enough.	Inyuma, bihagije.
I knew that	Nari nzi ko aribyo
Very nice baby	Umwana mwiza cyane.
She needed help looking after the baby.	Yari akeneye ubufasha bwo kureba umwana.
I think we are very close	Ntekereza ko turi hafi cyane
He was on his phone a lot.	Yari kuri terefone ye cyane.
I always feel that way.	Numva ari ko buri gihe.
I have a lot to say.	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
Many know a lot about a lot.	Benshi bazi byinshi kuri byinshi.
I didn't know what time it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo gihe
I need another question	Nkeneye ikindi kibazo
There is a woman here.	Hano hari umugore.
I needed money to help my wife	Nari nkeneye amafaranga yo gufasha umugore wanjye
I want to read my beautiful wife	Ndashaka gusoma umugore wanjye mwiza
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.

The meeting would be a great idea	Inama yaba igitekerezo cyiza cyane
You have	Ufite.
He needed money.	Yari akeneye amafaranga.
When we humans need it.	Iyo twe abantu dukeneye.
I want to go	Ndashaka kujyana
I never understood why	Sinigeze numva impamvu
I'm sorry but that is not the case.	Mbabajwe nibyo ariko ntabwo aribyo.

You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
I have this	Mfite ibi
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
He always knows how to do things right.	Buri gihe azi uburyo bwo gukora ibintu neza.
I have to think.	Ngomba gutekereza.
I knew nothing about him	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi kuri we
I need to find my daughter	Nkeneye gushaka umukobwa wanjye
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
It is not in this.	Ntabwo ari muri ibi.
But it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
I wanted to see my family	Nashakaga kubona umuryango wanjye
But he could also see.	Ariko yashoboraga no kureba.
You don't know what to do.	Ntabwo uzi icyo ukora.
You can go, you can go.	Urashobora kugenda, urashobora kugenda.
He wants, he wants.	Arashaka, arashaka.

We are one family.	Turi umuryango umwe.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I don’t know how to try so hard.	Ntazi kugerageza cyane.
Right now, this is what you want to know.	Kuri ubu, ibi nibyo ushaka kumenya.
I had the opportunity to look back	Nagize amahirwe yo kureba inyuma
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
Maybe it will be this week.	Ahari bizaba muri iki cyumweru.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.

But we are not.	Ariko ntabwo turi.
I see it as my money.	Njye mbona ari amafaranga yanjye.
But it was too far.	Ariko byari kure cyane.
After all.	Nyuma ya byose.
He does very well.	Akora neza cyane.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
I should have been scared	Nari nkwiye kugira ubwoba
Not much, but it was enough.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, ariko byari bihagije.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
If he has to live long.	Niba agomba kubaho igihe kirekire.
I like to work out my schedule	Nkunda gukora gahunda yanjye
Eventually, he was about to learn the truth.	Amaherezo, yari hafi kwiga ukuri.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko iki kibazo atari cyo kibazo cye.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
That's not the problem here.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo hano.
Obviously not here.	Biragaragara ko atari hano.
It was easy here.	Hano byari byoroshye.
I need to go very badly.	Nkeneye kugenda nabi cyane.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo.
I needed my time	Nari nkeneye umwanya wanjye
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Apparently she was a woman.	Biragaragara ko yari umugore.
I know he is right	Nzi ko avuga ukuri
You don't have another week.	Ntabwo ufite ikindi cyumweru.
A lot to say.	Byinshi byo kuvuga.
I don't want to be bad.	Sinshaka kuba mubi.
I can try to do it	Nshobora kugerageza kubikora
But one cannot remain on the ground.	Ariko umuntu ntashobora kuguma hasi.
I never saw that one.	Sinigeze mbona uwo.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I have to tell someone	Ngomba kubwira umuntu
When it is good it is good.	Iyo ari byiza nibyiza.
He wanted to know.	Yashakaga kumenya.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi byo gutekereza.
I knew the truth.	Nari nzi ukuri.
I did this.	Nakoze iyi.
Sometimes, that’s a good thing.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibyo ni ibintu byiza.
There are a lot of things that day	Kuri uwo munsi hari ibintu byinshi
You wouldn't go with that.	Ntabwo wari kujyana nibyo.
He never wanted anything else.	Ntiyigeze ashaka ikindi kintu.
We are all together.	Twese turi hamwe.
And obviously that's great.	Kandi biragaragara ko ari byiza cyane.
I trust everyone here	Nizera abantu bose hano

I didn't want to talk to you again	Sinifuzaga kongera kuvugana nawe
Anyway	Ibyo ari byo byose
This was his house.	Iyi yari inzu ye.

That's really good.	Nibyiza mubyukuri.
He could have done this better	Yashoboraga gukora iki cyiza
We need to know for sure.	Tugomba kumenya neza.
I have to get out of this	Ngomba kuva muri ibi
I wonder if they are friends	Ndabaza niba ari inshuti
I have things to learn	Mfite ibintu byo kwiga
I can't wait to see this	Sinshobora gutegereza kubona ibi
I was very young at the time.	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
I heard nothing	Nta kintu numvise
You can come here just to eat.	Urashobora kuza hano kurya gusa.
I don't know when.	Sinzi igihe.
I was sure she was my daughter	Nari nzi neza ko ari umukobwa wanjye
You can't wait to read more.	Ntushobora gutegereza gusoma byinshi.
He asked for help.	Yasabye ubufasha.
It was up to me.	Byari kuri njye.
I didn't know what to expect	Sinari nzi ibyo yari yiteze
What he had was not what he wanted.	Ibyo yari afite ntabwo yashakaga.
I guess this was easy	Ndakeka ko ibi byari byoroshye
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
I know exactly who he is talking about	Nzi neza uwo avuga
Inside and out.	Imbere no hanze.
Things went well.	Ibintu byagenze neza.
He is not one person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu umwe.
He was a young man.	Uwo yari umusore.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I feel like money for me.	Numva ari amafaranga kuri njye.
It would be nice.	Byaba ari byiza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
No big deal.	Nta kibazo kinini.
15 years.	Imyaka 15.
This week.	Kuri iki cyumweru.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu nibyo.
That he was not ready.	Ko atari yiteguye.
Little did I know that this would be normal	Sinari nzi ko ibi byaba ari ibintu bisanzwe
I like good and simple things	Nkunda ibintu byiza kandi byoroshye
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
I feel it all the time	Ndumva buri gihe
It's a job. 	Ni akazi.
'	'
I needed to know what happened	Nari nkeneye kumenya uko ibyo byagenze
I hope he thought about that for a long time	Ndizera ko yatekereje kuri ibyo igihe kirekire
I am an expert.	Ndi umuhanga.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
In fact, it looks very good.	Mubyukuri, birasa neza cyane.
You can't believe everything he says.	Ntushobora kwizera ikintu cyose avuga.
I can't see anything	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu na kimwe
And he is not a child.	Kandi ntabwo ari umwana.
I didn't have the money to eat.	Ntabwo nari mfite amafaranga yo kurya.
Or you can.	Cyangwa urashobora.
I can't wait to be with you again	Sinshobora gutegereza kongera kubana nawe
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Glad to be both	Nishimiye kuba bombi
I can't see.	Ntashobora kubona.
He went to his room.	Yagiye mu cyumba cye.
He was now very tall.	Ubu yari hejuru cyane.
His father can't.	Se ntashobora.
At any time.	Igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
He is in it.	Ari muri yo.
I did this	Nakoze ibi
I need to make time	Nkeneye gukora igihe
I really hope you did	Ndizera rwose ko wabikoze
He is a young player.	Ni umukinnyi muto.
You have to be a girl.	Ugomba kuba umukobwa.
I knew there was more to it.	Nari nzi ko hari byinshi.
But today, this is not true.	Ariko uyumunsi, ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I'm going to take a job	Ngiye gufata akazi
I know living with you is really good	Nzi ko kubana nawe nibyiza rwose
I know and feel things	Nzi kandi numva ibintu
I may be in prison now	Ubu nshobora kuba ndi muri gereza
In reality, however, things are not easy.	Mubyukuri, ariko, ibintu ntabwo byoroshye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He started playing a lot	Yatangiye gukina cyane
Not you and me.	Ntabwo ari wowe na njye.
There is money here.	Hano hari amafaranga.
I knew nothing about him.	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri we.
Things are great.	Ibintu nibyiza cyane.
I never thought that what you needed was so much	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ibyo ukeneye ari byinshi cyane
Very nice guy	Umusore mwiza cyane.
I want to go, go, go	Ndashaka kugenda, kugenda, kugenda
That's good! 	Nibyiza!

He never did and now he has a reason.	Ntabwo yigeze akora kandi ubu afite impamvu.
I need to live.	Nkeneye kubaho.
They are not just children.	Ntabwo ari abana gusa.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He must.	Agomba.
He did it close.	Yabikoze hafi.
And, none of that is your fault.	Kandi, nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari amakosa yawe.
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
Or just not on the floor.	Cyangwa gusa ntabwo ari hasi.
In fact, they are here.	Mubyukuri, bari hano.
He had to win.	Yagombaga gutsinda.
I heard this morning.	Numvise muri iki gitondo.
Everyone had.	Umuntu wese yari afite.
I really like the guy	Nkunda umusore rwose
Maybe he was a better person than I was.	Birashoboka ko yari umuntu mwiza kundusha.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko aribyo byiza.
I wasn't really lucky.	Ntabwo rwose nagize amahirwe.
I can't be here with you	Sinshobora kuba hano hamwe nawe
You really are.	Urimo rwose.
He had said a lot.	Yari yavuze byinshi.
I'm afraid to move on	Mfite ubwoba bwo kujya imbere
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
I like to live well.	Nkunda kubaho neza.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
It's good to be together.	Nibyiza kubana.
I think that is possible	Ndakeka ko ibyo bishoboka
And we needed it.	Kandi twari dukeneye.
He may find another time.	Ashobora kubona ikindi gihe.
I was not sure of that at the moment	Sinari nzi neza ibyo kuri ubu
Apparently he was at work.	Biragaragara ko yari ku kazi.
I was not lucky	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe
I can't really tell right now	Sinshobora kuvuga mubyukuri kuri ubu
I'm glad you're here	Nishimiye ko uri hano
That was a good reason to leave home as soon as possible.	Iyo yari impamvu nziza yo kuva murugo vuba bishoboka.
I should go.	Nkwiye kugenda.
I could never do that.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kubikora.
I need to go for help	Nkeneye kujya gushaka ubufasha
I just didn't think about it	Gusa sinigeze ntekereza ibyo byose
I thought that was easy enough	Natekereje ko ibyo byari byoroshye bihagije
All the same.	Byose kimwe.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
I didn’t know what I was feeling	Sinari nzi icyo numva
But not many.	Ariko si benshi.
You can't figure out why not now.	Ntushobora kumenya impamvu atari ubu.
I think of what he said	Ntekereza kubyo yavuze
I think he can figure out what to do	Ndatekereza ko ashobora kumenya icyo gukora
I'm not sure what that is, really.	Sinzi neza icyo, mubyukuri.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
Money is money.	Amafaranga ni amafaranga.
She was his last wife.	Yari umugore we wa nyuma.
It's today.	Ni uyu munsi.
I didn't even have to be here	Sinari nkwiye no kuba hano
I have to have the same time	Ngomba kugira igihe kimwe
If it was good, it was really good.	Niba ari mwiza, yari mwiza rwose.
There is not much to read here.	Nta byinshi byo gusoma hano.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I think we can do that	Ntekereza ko dushobora kubikora
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane ko ibi aribyo.
I'm not	Ntabwo ndimo
I never saw this	Sinigeze mbona ibi
I really don't think so.	Ntabwo rwose ntekereza.
I didn't know what he wanted	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
I'm not doing that	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora
And that would be great.	Kandi ibyo byaba byiza cyane.
I was not lucky.	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe.
He had only one.	Yari afite umwe gusa.
I would say the same thing	Nari kuvuga ikintu kimwe
He also went here.	Hano kandi yagiye.
He knew it was her.	Yari azi ko ari we.
I can't handle things right now	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ibintu ubu
I wasn’t going to do much today	Ntabwo nari ngiye gukora byinshi uyu munsi
And it was a house.	Kandi yari inzu.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
That's what he loves most.	Nibyo akunda cyane.
Maybe a little earlier.	Ahari mbere gato.
I see nothing	Ntacyo mbona
He has a book.	Afite igitabo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And tell your father, well.	Kandi kubwira se, neza.
I really wouldn't go.	Nukuri sinari kugenda.
I want to do something else	Ndashaka gukora ikindi kintu
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kuri byose.
And he is evil.	Kandi we mubi.
He wanted to do more and get more and be more.	Yashakaga gukora byinshi no kubona byinshi no kuba byinshi.
I knew you were out	Nari nzi ko uri hanze
Like him.	Nka we.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I really like reading	Nkunda gusoma rwose
We were.	Twari turi.
Lots of things here	Ibintu byinshi hano
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I am a teacher.	Ndi umwarimu.
I thought so	Natekereje ko aribyo
I thought I was a friend too	Natekerezaga ko njye na njye turi inshuti
He told me what to do.	Yambwiye icyo gukora.
I thought he looked scared	Natekereje ko asa naho afite ubwoba
He couldn't do it.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kubikora.
I don't need a boy	Ntacyo ngomba umuhungu
I can't imagine what it was like then.	Sinshobora kubona icyo yari cyo icyo gihe niki ndi ubu.
He knows everything today.	Azi ibintu byose muri iki gihe cyose.
I didn't know what to say	Sinari nzi icyo avuga
What he says today.	Ibyo avuga uyu munsi.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
I doubt you have much money alone	Ndashidikanya ko ufite amafaranga menshi wenyine
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I think that would be great	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza rwose
Every day was the same.	Buri munsi wari umwe.
He also wanted to play.	Yashakaga no gukina.
He went to see.	Yagiye kureba.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I need to try harder	Nkeneye kugerageza cyane
I have to stay away from him	Ngomba kuguma kure ye
Another problem.	Ikindi kibazo.
I can do nothing	Ntacyo nshobora gukora
He took it one day at a time.	Yafashe umunsi umwe umwe.
But the idea is good.	Ariko igitekerezo ni cyiza.
I really need to see people.	Nkeneye rwose kubona abantu.
I was not sure if that was possible	Sinari nzi neza niba ibyo bishoboka
I think we're down	Ndatekereza ko turi hasi
I didn't want to live	Sinifuzaga kubaho
We have a lot to do.	Dufite byinshi byo gukora.
I was well aware of all this	Nari nzi neza ibi byose
I also need money	Nkeneye kandi amafaranga
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I am very skilled	Ndi umuhanga cyane
I definitely have to go home.	Ngomba rwose gutaha.
I would do well	Nari gukora neza
I can tell exactly what happened	Nshobora kumenya neza uko byagenze
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
I didn’t know why he tried so hard	Sinari nzi impamvu yagerageje cyane
I had no one for a long time	Nta muntu nari mfite igihe kirekire
This is him.	Uyu ni we.
I wanted things in me	Nashakaga ibintu muri njye
I finally got the time to study	Amaherezo nabonye umwanya wo kwiga
You're upstairs.	Wowe hejuru.
That was very close.	Ibyo byari hafi cyane.
Recently.	Vuba aha.
I didn’t know that was all	Sinari nzi ko aribyo byose
'	'
I'm glad you are	Nishimiye ko uri
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
I can't think of a better way to do it	Sinshobora gutekereza kubikora
It wouldn't have happened to me.	Ntabwo byari kuba kuri njye.
I have a lot to learn first	Mfite byinshi byo kwiga mbere
I didn't want to go	Sinifuzaga kugenda
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo ari cyo
I love people.	Nkunda abantu.
I never wanted to, ever.	Sinigeze nshaka, na rimwe.
I saw it all	Nabonye byose
I'm going to try to do this later.	Ngiye kugerageza gukora ibi nyuma.
I don't see anything before	Ntacyo mbona mbere
You would not be good.	Ntabwo waba mwiza.
I wanted to go out	Nashakaga kujya hanze
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I need to get well.	Nkeneye kuza neza.
You can take a good look at it.	Urashobora kureba neza muri yo.
But it is big.	Ariko ni kinini.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
I know what he says is true	Nzi ko ibyo avuga ari ukuri
And people are nearby.	Kandi abantu bari hafi.
I'm not sure how.	Sinzi neza uko.
You are a woman.	Uri umugore.
I think an idea is a great idea.	Ntekereza ko igitekerezo ari igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
I think that was good for him	Ndakeka ko ibyo byari byiza kuri we
Everything was in front of me.	Ibintu byose byari imbere yanjye.
It was difficult.	Yari bigoye.
Looks like you have what you want.	Birasa nkaho ufite ibyo ushaka.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Ibintu byinshi ushobora gukora.
I can't take any of that	Sinshobora gufata kimwe muri ibyo
I am very happy so far.	Nishimiye cyane kugeza ubu.
I think this is a gift	Ntekereza ko iyi ari impano
I don't mean to say.	Sinshaka kuvuga.
I can be anyone	Nshobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese
I didn't know how to do it.	Ntabwo nari nzi uburyo bwo kubikora.
I had a small hearing problem	Nagize ikibazo gito cyo kumva
That's what we were after.	Nibyo twari nyuma.
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
I need time to think	Nkeneye umwanya wo gutekereza
And that was not enough.	Kandi ntabwo byari bihagije.
He doesn't have to say much.	Ntabwo agomba kuvuga byinshi.
I guess he also had a wife	Ndakeka ko nawe yari afite umugore
I got the idea.	Nabonye igitekerezo.
I did really well	Nakoze neza rwose
He chose to play after talking to his father.	Yahisemo gukina nyuma yo kuvugana na se.
I mean, she's so beautiful	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari mwiza cyane
Being close was a very bad idea.	Kuba hafi byari igitekerezo kibi cyane.
They have a lot of opportunities.	Bafite amahirwe menshi.
I never liked it very much	Sinigeze nkunda cyane
Anyone can do it.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
You are helping.	Urimo gufasha.
He would do nothing.	Nta kintu gito yari gukora.
They were all scared.	Bose bari bafite ubwoba.
Boy, maybe.	Umuhungu, birashoboka.
To.	Kuri.
I found a new house in the distance	Nabonye inzu nshya kure
I'm not sure why he didn't.	Sinzi neza impamvu atabikoze.
I feel there	Ndumva ahari
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
This is definitely not the case.	Ibi rwose ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I guess that's possible	Ndakeka ko bishoboka
I'm not sure if it's okay to do that.	Ntabwo nzi neza niba ari byiza kubikora.
She wants to eat again.	Arashaka kongera kurya.
I really wanted him to be a bad guy	Nashakaga rwose ko aba umusore mubi
We can't wait to go back.	Ntidushobora gutegereza gusubira inyuma.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
I think of him every day.	Ntekereza kuri we buri munsi.
I know you have	Nzi ko ufite
You have to have someone.	Ugomba kugira umuntu.
I think it's great	Ntekereza ko ari byiza cyane
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
And that's exactly what you want to hear.	Kandi nibyo rwose ushaka kumva.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
I didn't see what happened	Ntabwo nabonye uko byagenze
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
He was a young man who did it.	Yari umusore wabikoze.
But that is not what he wanted.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo yashakaga.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
I hope you are	Ndizera ko ari wowe
He didn't want to go.	Ntabwo yashakaga kugenda.
I knew what he was thinking	Nari nzi icyo atekereza
She is not a little girl.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa muto.
It's good to talk to you.	Nibyiza kuvugana nawe.
The moment he looked at this.	Umwanya yarebye ibi.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
I think we should talk.	Ntekereza ko tugomba kuvuga.
He may be there now.	Ashobora kuba ahari ubu.
This time, just the truth.	Iki gihe, ukuri gusa.
That's really good	Nibyiza rwose
I just heard.	Numvise gusa.
Everyone is at home.	Abantu bose bari murugo.
I didn’t, but only	Ntabwo nakoze, ariko gusa
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
Looks like you did it.	Birasa nkaho wabikoze.
I know what he likes to drink.	Nzi icyo akunda kunywa.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while	Nashakaga kuba wenyine nawe igihe gito
I should not eat food.	Ntabwo nkwiye kurya ibiryo.
Or reading too much.	Cyangwa gusoma cyane.
You can do anything, big or small.	Urashobora gukora ikintu cyose, kinini cyangwa gito.
I thought it would be great once	Natekereje ko rimwe byaba byiza
And her father, to see a boy without a wife.	Kandi se niwe, kubona umuhungu adafite umugore.
I can't do what he says	Sinshobora gukora ibyo avuga
I can't think of anything	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe
I think it's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
He was just right.	Gusa yari mubyukuri.
Maybe this was a mistake.	Ahari ibi byari amakosa.
It’s everyone for him.	Ni umuntu wese kuri we.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
A very beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza cyane
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
I was worried.	Nagize impungenge.
I don't like school here	Ntabwo nkunda ishuri hano
I can't stay on the phone	Sinshobora kuguma kuri terefone
He thought he was gone by then.	Yatekereje ko icyo gihe yari yagiye.
However, the woman in front was a problem.	Ariko, umugore uri imbere yari ikibazo.
But, if you really want to be.	Ariko, niba ushaka kuba mubyukuri.
I didn't know what to do before	Sinari nzi icyo gukora mbere
I really need to go	Nkeneye rwose kugenda
He was his friend.	Yari inshuti ye.
But this is what he did.	Ariko ibi nibyo yakoze.
He just loved the top.	Yakundaga gusa hejuru.
I didn't want to go back	Sinifuzaga kongera gusubira inyuma
He had a lot of problems.	Yari afite ibibazo byinshi.
I was not sure what it was	Sinari nzi neza icyo aricyo
I see nothing in front of me	Ntacyo mbona imbere yanjye
'	'
We had time.	Twari dufite igihe.
He is an expert.	Ni umuhanga.
I think you need it whenever you can	Ntekereza ko ukeneye igihe cyose ushobora kubona
What I do.	Icyo nkora.
Down with me.	Hasi hamwe nanjye.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari we wenyine.
I had trouble trusting anyone	Nagize ikibazo cyo kwizera umuntu uwo ari we wese
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
I’m definitely going to buy more.	Rwose ngiye kugura byinshi.
I had nothing good to hold on to.	Nta kintu cyiza nari mfite cyo gufata.
Behind.	Inyuma.
I was not even in this world	Ntabwo nari no kuri iyi si
And they were at home.	Kandi bari murugo.
I can walk for a while	Nshobora kugenda igihe gito
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hano hari ibintu byiza rwose.
Okay, but they were.	Nibyiza, ariko bari.
He needed to think.	Yari akeneye gutekereza.
I did nothing	Ntacyo nakoze
I was going to find out what he knew	Nari ngiye kumenya icyo yari azi
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
This is just a person.	Uyu ni umuntu gusa.
I heard you were going too	Numvise ko nawe ugiye
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
You don't have to do that if you don't want to.	Ntugomba kubikora niba udashaka.
I didn’t know what to do in everything	Sinari nzi icyo gukora muri byose
And he was.	Kandi yari.
At the time, I didn't think much of it	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga cyane
He was always his.	Buri gihe yari we.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
But the space here is short.	Ariko umwanya hano ni muto.
Eating out was great.	Kurya hanze byari byiza cyane.
We have no problem.	Nta kibazo dufite.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I think this is good.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza.
I just didn't know what he wanted	Gusa sinari nzi icyo ashaka
He's going to have something to say.	Agiye kugira icyo avuga.
And her hair is really beautiful.	Kandi umusatsi we rwose ni mwiza.
Obviously there is a lot to do.	Biragaragara ko hari byinshi byo gukora.
But he is really a good person.	Ariko mubyukuri umuntu mwiza.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
And up for a long time.	Kandi hejuru igihe kinini.
I was young at the time	Icyo gihe nari muto
Everyone is.	Abantu bose ni.
She thought he was his wife.	Yatekereje ko ari umugore we.
I mean, it was good, but it was close	Ndashaka kuvuga, byari byiza, ariko byari hafi
If not.	Niba atari byo.
I wanted to try.	Nashakaga kugerageza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, gahunda nziza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She loved to read.	Yakundaga gusoma.
But a woman.	Ariko umugore.
I think he looks good	Ntekereza ko asa neza
It is a family.	Ni umuryango.
I didn't know it was possible	Sinari nzi ko bishoboka
And it looks good.	Kandi asa neza.
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri ibyo
I was not good to him.	Ntabwo nari mwiza kuri we.
With all that.	Hamwe nibyo byose.
That's your wife.	Uwo ni umugore wawe.
Things he shouldn't know.	Ibintu atagomba kumenya.
This one really is both.	Uyu rwose ni bombi.
It is not for him.	Ntabwo ari kuri we.
I need to know what happened	Nkwiye kumenya uko byagenze
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
I was not scared, not at all	Ntabwo nagize ubwoba, nta na gato
I'm so much better than that	Ndi mwiza cyane kurenza ibyo
That's right.	Ni byo.
But he chose.	Ariko yahisemo.
I'm going to get a book.	Ngiye kubona igitabo.
I can learn to do anything	Nshobora kwiga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
We have a good plan.	Dufite gahunda nziza.
I never heard of anything	Sinigeze numva ikintu
And in fact it was not true.	Kandi mubyukuri ntabwo byari ukuri.
Only friends.	Muri inshuti gusa.
The truth.	Ukuri.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I want her to feel the same way	Ndashaka ko na we yumva
He wanted to talk to me.	Yashakaga kuvugana nanjye.
I mean everything.	Ndashaka kuvuga ibintu byose.
And you don't have to.	Kandi nawe ntugomba kubikora.
Go to that meeting.	Kujya muri iyo nama.
None of this is good.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari cyiza.
I was very close	Nari hafi cyane
I think there is work here	Ntekereza ko hano hari akazi
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
To see	Kureba.
I saw it all	Nabonye byose
I was sure he was gone	Nari nzi neza ko yagiye
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
I doubt anyone will be there	Ndashidikanya ko umuntu wese azaba ahari
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
I was in his house	Nari mu nzu ye
My hair is bad.	Umusatsi wanjye uri mubi.
And he is not here.	Kandi ntabwo ari hano.
I was worried for a long time	Nagize impungenge igihe kirekire
I can't speak tonight	Sinshobora kuvuga muri iri joro
Someone who knows what he wants.	Numuntu uzi icyo ashaka.
Behind him.	Inyuma ye.
And sometimes, that's not all.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe, ntabwo ari byinshi.
I feel bad all the time.	Ndumva nabi igihe cyose.
This is obviously not true.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari ukuri.
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
But today was a good day.	Ariko uyu munsi wari umunsi mwiza.
I don’t know how to do one of those	Sinzi gukora kimwe muri ibyo
He is alone.	Ari muri we wenyine.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
It will be much, much better.	Bizaba byinshi, byiza cyane.
He was upstairs.	Yari hejuru.
I make a lot of mistakes	Nkora amakosa menshi
I wanted more than anything else	Nashakaga kuruta ikindi kintu cyose
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I need to get my clothes on	Nkeneye kubona imyenda yanjye
When he is ready.	Iyo yiteguye.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
He was ready to go.	Yari yiteguye kugenda.
I know this is true	Nzi ko ibi ari ukuri
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
I can't believe what happened	Sinshobora kwizera uko ibintu byagenze
I misunderstood the child	Numvise nabi umwana
When you are in prison.	Iyo uri muri gereza.
I knew nothing about this	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri ibi
I want to hear more, more, more.	Ndashaka kumva byinshi, byinshi, byinshi.
Maybe inside out he hopes it is.	Ahari imbere imbere yizeye ko ari.
If you think.	Niba utekereza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I think she was a young woman	Ntekereza ko yari umugore muto
I have a problem for everyone	Mfite ikibazo kuri buri wese
I should be one	Nkwiye kuba umwe
I need more.	Nkeneye byinshi.
They didn’t have much luck.	Ntabwo bari bafite amahirwe menshi.
He could see someone.	Yashoboraga kubona umuntu.
I knew nothing	Ntacyo nari nzi
I have good friends	Mfite inshuti nziza
I can't go back now	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma ubu
I thought before	Natekereje ko mbere
I can't read	Sinshobora gusoma
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
I knew that was what he needed for me	Nari nzi ko aricyo yari akeneye kuri njye
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
I hope so	Nizera ko aribyo
I can't figure out the problem.	Sinshobora kumenya ikibazo.
I am now in his room.	Ubu ndi mu cyumba cye.
I'm sure it's a mistake.	Nzi neza ko ari amakosa.
I did nothing.	Ntacyo nakoze.
You have to give up that.	Ugomba kureka ibyo.
We are not far from having it now.	Ntabwo turi kure yo kugira ubu.
Money is not a problem.	Amafaranga ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I can't find anything wrong here	Sinshobora kubona ikintu kibi hano
He was above me.	Yari hejuru yanjye.
For all the good things he did	Ku byiza byose yakoze
I'm glad he didn't say anything.	Nishimiye ko ntacyo avuga.
What I don't want.	Icyo ntashaka.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
Her son was also a girl.	Umwana we na we yari umukobwa.
Sometimes he has trouble walking.	Rimwe na rimwe agira ikibazo cyo kugenda.
All the best.	Ibintu byiza byose.
I hope you can be a teacher there	Ndizera ko ushobora kuba umwarimu aho
Only it was not good.	Gusa ntabwo byari byiza.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I know a lot of it is true	Nzi ko byinshi ari ukuri
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
I don't know what he wants.	Ntabwo nzi icyo ashaka.
There is no one today.	Nta muntu n'umwe muri iki gihe.
I hope you can do it.	Ndizera ko ushobora kubikora.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
I'm not happy with you	Ntabwo nishimiye nawe
I'm so glad he has a friend	Nishimiye cyane ko afite inshuti
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
And probably not.	Kandi birashoboka ko atari byo.
He said the young man was very nice.	Yavuze ko umusore yari mwiza cyane.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
Good question	Ikibazo cyiza
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Maybe there is too much.	Ahari hariho byinshi cyane.
I can't do that	Sinshobora kubikora
I know you are a good person	Nzi ko uri umuntu mwiza
I had thought before.	Nari natekereje mbere.
I just don't know what to do with you.	Gusa sinzi icyo gukora nawe.
But now.	Ariko ubu.
I thought a lot and thought	Natekereje cyane ndatekereza
And he knew something else.	Kandi yari azi ikindi kintu.
She wants to study.	Ashaka kwiga.
I can't believe he did it	Sinshobora kwizera ko yabikoze
He was here for him.	Yari hano kuri we.
I saw good things about it	Nabonye ibintu byiza kuri yo
He had done nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yakoze.
For me you are.	Kuri njye uri.
It was his day.	Wari umunsi we.
I should go	Nkwiye kugenda
He loved what he saw.	Yakundaga ibyo yabonye.
It was just a matter of time.	Nkaho byari ikibazo gusa.
You need less time.	Ukeneye umwanya muto.
You can't wait to see what you do.	Ntushobora gutegereza kureba icyo ukora.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
A little time.	Umwanya muto.
If we have another problem.	Niba dufite ikindi kibazo.
I hope we all have to go	Nizera ko twese tugomba kugenda
At that time he came alone.	Icyo gihe yaje wenyine.
I want to be me.	Ndashaka kuba njye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Maybe I was lucky enough to see that.	Birashoboka ko nagize amahirwe yo kubona ibyo.
I didn't know what to do here	Sinari nzi icyo gukora hano
We were outside.	Twari hanze.
You don’t have to go back	Ntugomba gusubira inyuma
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I know you're smart	Nzi ko ufite ubwenge
I think he needs time	Ntekereza ko akeneye umwanya
I wanted to stay.	Nashakaga kuguma.
I know he has the truth too	Nzi ko na we afite ukuri
I didn’t want to do anything, really	Sinifuzaga gukora ikintu na kimwe, mubyukuri
I saw someone	Nabonye umuntu
There is something here.	Hano hari ikintu.
He did not know who he was.	Ntiyari azi uwo ari we.
I wanted to know everything	Nashakaga kumenya byose
I saw a lot of things outside	Nabonye ibintu byinshi hanze
You can win.	Urashobora gutsinda.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He was not sure where to go.	Ntabwo yari azi neza aho agomba kujya.
No one is good.	Nta muntu mwiza.
I know he is.	Nzi ko ari we.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
You haven't seen much.	Ntabwo wabonye byinshi.
I can get a job soon	Nshobora kubona akazi vuba
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kujyana
But you can help.	Ariko urashobora gufasha.
I know what it is	Nzi icyo aricyo
He was now behind me.	Ubu yari inyuma yanjye.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo sibyo.
I don't know the day	Ntabwo nzi umunsi
I didn't hear anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise.
That's right, you know everything.	Nibyo, uzi byose.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekereje cyane kurenza ibyo
Another time.	Ikindi gihe.
I was really scared.	Nagize ubwoba rwose.
I saw a lot and heard a lot	Nabonye byinshi kandi numvise byinshi
I would do the same	Nanjye nari kubikora
He did great things.	Yakoze ibintu byiza cyane.
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
I didn’t know if that was good or not	Sinari nzi niba ibyo ari byiza cyangwa atari byiza
I want to drink now	Ndashaka kunywa ubu
He was not old.	Ntiyari afite imyaka.
I didn't mean to offend	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga mubyukuri
I have time to try.	Mfite umwanya wo kugerageza.
I don't like it at all.	Ntabwo nkunda na gato.
He knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi.
We were all.	Twese twari.
I want to be with him	Ndashaka kubana na we
He expected that.	Yari yiteze ko.
In a short time that was good.	Mu gihe gito ibyo byari byiza.
Staying here is not good.	Kuguma hano ntabwo ari byiza.
I guess that's normal	Ndakeka ko ari ibintu bisanzwe
I was sure of one thing	Nari nzi neza ikintu kimwe
I should know better	Nkwiye kumenya neza
I want to see something	Ndashaka kubona ikintu
He is above me.	Ari hejuru yanjye.
This is absolutely true.	Ibi ni ukuri rwose.
But it was a day.	Ariko wari umunsi.
He had already said a lot.	Yari amaze kuvuga byinshi.
I was a child.	Nari umwana.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Everything.	Byose.
I'm sure it's good.	Nzi neza ko ari byiza.
Can you help with this? 	Urashobora gufasha muri ibi?
I want to be human rather than human	Ndashaka kuba umuntu aho kuba umuntu
I hadn’t really thought about the plan	Sinari natekereje neza kuri gahunda
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I thought it was a good thing to do	Natekereje ko aricyo kintu cyiza cyo gukora
I know what he is saying.	Nzi ibyo avuga.
You can't help everyone.	Ntushobora gufasha abantu bose.
The car is very nice.	Imodoka ni nziza cyane.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
I did not know who he was	Ntabwo nari nzi uwo ari we
He was probably human.	Birashoboka ko yari umuntu.
It is not a big deal for me.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini kuri njye.
I only have one idea.	Mfite igitekerezo kimwe gusa.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
I was scared too	Nanjye nagize ubwoba
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
I really want to do something good	Ndashaka cyane gukora ikintu cyiza
I didn't want to look bad	Sinifuzaga kureba neza
That's great for us.	Nibyiza cyane kuri twe.
Anyone, or anything else.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese, cyangwa ikindi icyo aricyo cyose.
I believe he is right	Nizera ko afite ukuri
You had no way of knowing.	Ntabwo wari ufite uburyo bwo kumenya.
I really want to stay here for a while	Ndashaka rwose kuguma hano igihe gito
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
Always human.	Buri gihe umuntu.
There is little chance of that.	Ntabwo amahirwe menshi kuri ibyo.
I want to live this week.	Ndashaka kubaho muri iki cyumweru.
I'm really sorry	Mbabajwe rwose nibyo
It's not a plan at all.	Ntabwo ari gahunda rwose.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
He thought I wanted to go home	Yatekereje ko nshaka gutaha
I saw this.	Nabonye ibi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
For everything.	Kuri buri kintu cyose.
The food was good.	Ibiryo byari byiza.

You can't have everything.	Ntushobora kugira byose.
I'm not	Ntabwo ndimo
I think it was a good plan	Ntekereza ko byari gahunda nziza
I don't deserve it	Ntabwo nkwiye
One day	Umunsi umwe.
This is it now.	Ubu ni ubu.
He was probably inside.	Birashoboka ko yari imbere.
It's late.	Ni nyuma.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I am very happy	Nishimiye cyane
His daughter was a friend.	Umukobwa we yari inshuti.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I get a lot of gifts	Mbona impano nyinshi
But I don't know what to do.	Ariko sinzi icyo nkwiye gukora.
Maybe that's enough.	Birashoboka ko ibyo bihagije.
He said that every day.	Yavuze ko buri munsi.
But money speaks, as usual.	Ariko amafaranga avuga, nkuko bisanzwe.
I don't know what he thinks	Sinzi icyo atekereza
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
I am happy to be his son	Nishimiye kuba umuhungu we
Kinini.	Kinini.
I never liked it	Ntabwo nigeze nkunda
This is sometimes the case, but not always, obviously.	Ibi ni rimwe na rimwe, ariko ntabwo buri gihe, biragaragara.

He is a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza.

This time it was clear that the woman was his.	Iki gihe biragaragara ko umugore yari we.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I wanted to say something outside.	Nashakaga kuvuga ikintu hanze.

These are just things.	Ibi ni ibintu gusa.

I didn’t know it was a good thing	Sinari nzi ko ari ibintu byiza
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.

He understands why.	Yumva impamvu.
He can't even do it.	Ntashobora no kubikora.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
I have to go quickly.	Ngomba kugenda vuba.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
You can't talk to me.	Ntushobora kuvugana nanjye.
I had nothing for him	Ntacyo nari mfite kuri we
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I would do it.	Nari kubikora.
I don't need this.	Ntabwo nkeneye ibi.
And before him.	Kandi imbere ye.
It's better than that.	Nibyiza cyane kurenza ibyo.
He is one.	Ni umwe.
It’s not who you want to win.	Ntabwo ari uwo ushaka gutsinda.
I'm far away.	Njye kure.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I know he thought he was doing well.	Nzi ko yatekerezaga ko akora neza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I never heard him speak like that before	Sinigeze numva avuga nka mbere
I have to do it	Ngomba kubikora
He was behind me.	Yari inyuma yanjye.
And here we were.	Kandi hano twari.
I had nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari mfite
We were the first.	Twari aba mbere.
He chose the time when.	Yahisemo umwanya mugihe.
He saw what had happened.	Yabonye uko byagenze.
I want to play	Ndashaka gukina
But that’s not good enough.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
There is.	Hariho.
This was the day.	Uyu wari umunsi.
You need money.	Ukeneye amafaranga.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.

Me, it’s not very good.	Njye, ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
Her beautiful hair.	Umusatsi we mwiza.
At the time, I didn't hear anything	Icyo gihe ntacyo numvise
More than ever.	Kurenza mbere.

I needed something to do	Nari nkeneye ikintu cyo gukora
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He said he looked good.	Yavuze ko asa neza.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
I can’t think of them all	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri bose
I saw a movie.	Nabonye firime.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
A big deal, really	Ikintu kinini, mubyukuri
We were close at the time.	Icyo gihe twari hafi.
And here is the way to do it here.	Kandi hano hari uburyo bwo gukora hano.
You had a baby.	Wari ufite umwana.
All of this is.	Ibi byose ni.
It is not easier than this.	Ntabwo byoroshye kurenza ibi.
We needed money.	Twari dukeneye amafaranga.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
I did something else	Nakoze ikindi kintu
I mean, you look good	Ndashaka kuvuga, ko usa neza
I really didn't need it	Ntabwo rwose nari nkeneye
I just didn't know what to do	Gusa sinari nzi icyo gukora
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari amakosa.
I want the truth.	Ndashaka ukuri.
You have to get out of here.	Ugomba kuva hano.
I think that would be nice.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza.
I never thought of a gift for him	Sinigeze ntekereza impano kuri we
I have to think about something good	Ngomba gutekereza ku kintu cyiza
I don't have time.	Ntabwo mfite umwanya.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
And that's exactly what he wanted.	Kandi ibyo ni byo yashakaga.
Only his luck.	Amahirwe ye gusa.
It can't be.	Ntashobora kuba.
Maybe that's what he wants.	Birashoboka ko aribyo ashaka.
He never spoke at this time.	Ntabwo yigeze avuga kuri iki gihe.
He's gone now.	Yagiye ubu.
He was alone.	Na we yari wenyine.
But he is right.	Ariko afite ukuri.
He has to do a lot.	Agomba gukora byinshi.
I thought she was a woman	Natekereje ko ari umugore
I never thought it was	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ari
It is good at any time.	Nibyiza igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kubikora.
I want to be your friend	Ndashaka kuba inshuti yawe
I know who he is	Nzi uwo ari we
That's right.	Nibyo.
It would be really easy to do.	Byaba rwose byoroshye gukora.
I can't get enough	Ntabwo nshobora kubona bihagije
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka rwose ko ibi aribyo hano.
I don't see a problem.	Ntabwo mbona ikibazo.
It would be nice later.	Byaba byiza nyuma.
I can't think of anything	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe
I am an outsider	Ndi umuntu wo hanze
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
That's what you have to do.	Nibyo ugomba gukora.
Someone does this.	Umuntu akora ibi.
But he can.	Ariko arashobora.
Everything was simple, straightforward and normal.	Ibintu byose byari byoroshye, byoroshye kandi bisanzwe.
Now maybe I need to do it.	Ubu birashoboka ko nkeneye kubikora.
But he is not the same person.	Ariko ntabwo ari umuntu umwe.
You think of hair.	Utekereza umusatsi.
I was not at home either	Nanjye sinari murugo
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
A really nice and smart kid	Umwana mwiza rwose kandi uzi ubwenge
It started well.	Yatangiye neza.
I was sure that	Nari nzi neza ko
Not that there really is a problem.	Ntabwo ari uko mubyukuri hari ikibazo.

I'm talking to you.	Ndimo kuvugana nawe.
I should have done better	Nari nkwiye gukora neza
I was lucky for him	Nagize amahirwe kuri we
You can't do well.	Ntushobora gukora neza.
I really don't want to be that way.	Sinshaka rwose kuba uko.
It's good outside.	Nibyiza hanze.
I can't wait to read it away from you	Sinshobora gutegereza gusoma kure yawe
I thought.	Natekerezaga.
He is not.	Ntabwo arimo.
There are only things we can do.	Hariho ibintu gusa dushobora gukora.
He said he could.	Yavuze ko ashobora.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
One can do it.	Umuntu arashobora kubikora.
At that time it would not be good.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yari kuba mwiza.
Na se.	Na se.
Things that money can't buy.	Ibintu amafaranga ntashobora kugura.
They have a plan.	Bafite gahunda.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
That would be a good idea.	Byaba ari ikibazo cyiza.
I can figure out what it is	Nshobora kumenya icyo aricyo
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
I was sure it was.	Nari nzi neza ko ari.
I also had the idea of ​​a father	Nanjye nari mfite igitekerezo cya se
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I don’t believe it but so far	Ntabwo nizera ariko kugeza ubu
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
I wanted to stay where he was	Nashakaga kuguma aho yari ari
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu aribyo.
I was not a favorite person	Ntabwo nari umuntu yakundaga
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
I'm worried about him	Mfite impungenge kuri we
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I think they have.	Ntekereza ko bafite.
I should go find your gift	Nkwiye kujya gushaka impano yawe
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
I didn’t have a big problem	Ntabwo nagize ikibazo kinini
You can't wait for anyone.	Ntushobora gutegereza umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He loved dogs.	Yakundaga imbwa.
He had a reason.	Yari afite impamvu.
I know that's not true	Nzi ko ibyo atari ukuri
He should not drive.	Ntagomba gutwara.
I needed to be with him	Nari nkeneye kubana na we
He is not going.	Ntabwo agenda.
That's not a good thing to do.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I can't do that	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora
I have to read everything	Ngomba gusoma byose
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.

But there is something wrong.	Ariko hari ikintu kibi.

I just need to do more.	Nkeneye gusa gukora byinshi.
I want you to be here.	Ndashaka ko uri hano.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
I believe he was worried	Ndizera ko yari afite impungenge
But that was outside.	Ariko ibyo byari hanze.
However, he was not the only person.	Ariko, ntabwo yari umuntu umwe gusa.
I have to have money.	Ngomba kugira amafaranga.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
I have another problem today	Mfite ikindi kibazo kimwe uyu munsi
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
I was scared like him	Nagize ubwoba nka we
You need to know what you are up to.	Ugomba kumenya ibyo urimo.
I thought he was behind me	Natekereje ko ari inyuma yanjye
Sometimes there is a reason to do so.	Rimwe na rimwe hariho impamvu yo kubikora.
And he probably has the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
But soon he will be home well, now.	Ariko vuba aha azaba murugo neza, nonaha.
It looks good.	Asa neza.
We have to think.	Tugomba gutekereza.
I just thought.	Natekereje gusa.
I just need time to think about everything	Nkeneye gusa igihe cyo gutekereza kuri byose
Until after the movie.	Kugeza nyuma ya firime.
But he is right.	Ariko afite ukuri.
It was hard for him.	Byari bigoye kuri we.
I was well aware of that	Nari nzi neza ibyo
I really think so	Ndatekereza rwose ko aribyo
I think he needs money a lot	Ndakeka ko akeneye amafaranga cyane
I have to live today	Ngomba kubaho muri iki gihe
I know you don't want to.	Nzi ko udashaka.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I have a car outside.	Mfite imodoka hanze.
I know a guy who knows a guy	Nzi umusore uzi umusore
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
Do you want?	Urashaka?.

I wanted to talk to you soon	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe vuba
And he would not understand.	Kandi ntiyari kumva.
I never saw it clearly.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona neza.
I want to do something about that.	Ndashaka kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo.
It was probably too early.	Birashoboka ko yari kare cyane.
Until then he had no problem.	Kugeza icyo gihe nta kibazo yari afite.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko azabikora, niba ari we.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I doubt that is the case.	Ndashidikanya ko aribyo.
I was very embarrassed.	Nagize isoni nyinshi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.

Now he has an idea.	Ubu afite igitekerezo.
It hadn't been long.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe kinini.
He wants a lot of money.	Arashaka amafaranga menshi.
You have what you need.	Ufite ibyo ukeneye.
Walk, walk, walk.	Kugenda, kugenda, kugenda.
And so do I.	Kandi nanjye.
You have to work hard.	Ugomba gukora cyane.
It is not possible to earn money alone.	Ntabwo bishoboka rwose kubona amafaranga wenyine.
I know exactly what happened	Nzi neza, uko byagenze
It would be nice to be alone.	Bizaba byiza kuba ari twe gusa.
I knew we could do it	Nari nzi ko dushobora kubikora
I would do something	Nari kugira icyo nkora

Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari abantu kuri buri.
You didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo wari uzi icyo gukora.

But only if you have nothing good to do.	Ariko gusa niba ntacyo ufite cyiza cyo gukora.
I can't carry everyone	Sinshobora gutwara abantu bose

To say that it is a good book.	Kuvuga ko ari igitabo cyiza.
He is very young.	Ari muto cyane.

Everything was normal	Byose byari bisanzwe

Maybe later.	Birashoboka nyuma.
No one did it.	Nta n'umwe wabikoze.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.

Bad idea from the beginning	Igitekerezo kibi kuva mbere

You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He had no one.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari afite.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I want to see.	Ndashaka kubona.
You have to say why you need a job.	Ugomba kuvuga impamvu ukeneye akazi.
But he used to know that he was close to her every morning.	Ariko yakundaga kumenya ko ari hafi ye buri gitondo.
I should have known something	Nari ngomba kumenya ikintu
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I'm terrified	Mfite ubwoba bwo hejuru
We need to take the time to get to know people.	Tugomba gufata umwanya wo kumenya abantu.
It's just an idea.	Ni igitekerezo gusa.
He did not always think so.	Ntabwo buri gihe yatekerezaga gutya.
But he heard why he wanted to leave.	Ariko yumvise impamvu yashakaga kugenda.
I think a little	Ntekereza gato
Time, however.	Umwanya, ariko.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
.	.
Nothing here.	Hano nta.
I'm not sure how.	Sinzi neza uko.
I never thought of anything like that	Sinigeze ntekereza ikintu na kimwe muri byo
I have a plan for him	Mfite gahunda kuri we
I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva.
But this is true.	Ariko ibi ni ukuri.
I may have a problem with that	Nshobora kugira ikibazo kuri ibyo
I once did	Nigeze kubikora
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
I want to learn more.	Ndashaka kwiga byinshi.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
It was all true.	Byose byari ukuri.
I wondered what it would be like to live with him	Natekereje uko byari kubana na we
She knew in that look that he had failed her.	Yari azi ko agomba no kumva afite isoni.
I mean, well.	Ndashaka kuvuga, neza.
Something really.	Ikintu mubyukuri.
You need your daughter.	Ukeneye umukobwa wawe.
I didn't see it at the time	Sinigeze mbona icyo gihe
I love living with you.	Nkunda kubana nawe.
I have nothing	Ntacyo mfite
But one more thing.	Ariko ikindi kintu kimwe.
There is something else though.	Hari ikindi ariko.
Everyone has.	Umuntu wese ufite.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu.
I don't even have to be here	Ntabwo nkwiye no kuba hano hano
Same idea here.	Igitekerezo kimwe hano.
You are human after all.	Uri umuntu nyuma ya byose.
I don’t think he’s too bad, he chose	Ndakeka ko atari mubi cyane, yahisemo
I was sure that	Nari nzi neza ko
He just looked inside.	Gusa yarebye imbere.
You need everything else.	Ukeneye ikindi kintu cyose.
I didn’t think he could do it on his own	Sinatekerezaga ko ashobora kubikora wenyine
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I can do everything right.	Nshobora gukora ibintu byose neza.
And that's not what he wanted.	Kandi ntabwo aribyo yashakaga.
And think positively.	Kandi gutekereza neza.
For him, that will be enough.	Kuri we, ibyo bizaba bihagije.
I think there is something in us.	Ntekereza ko hari ikintu muri twe.
Nothing.	Ntacyo.
A lot of money	Amafaranga menshi
I hope none of this is true	Nizere ko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri
He just wanted to know.	Yashakaga kumenya gusa.
But there is probably a backlash now.	Ariko birashoboka ko hariho gusubira inyuma ubu.
You know you are.	Uzi ko uri.
I could be worse	Nshobora kuba mubi
He can say bad things.	Arashobora kuvuga ikintu kibi.
I have never seen it before, or since	Sinigeze mbona mbere, cyangwa kuva
So far everything is fine.	Kugeza ubu ibintu byose ni byiza.
That's not true.	Icyo atari cyo.
This is him.	Uyu ni we.
There is something for everyone.	Hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
He is my son.	Ni umuhungu wanjye.
I can't see the problem.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikibazo.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
He was looking for a son.	Yashakaga umuhungu.
I'm not going to do that	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora
It would come to me too.	Nanjye byari kuza kuri njye.
But sometimes.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe.
I needed to know for sure who he was	Nari nkeneye kumenya neza ko ari we
I really have to go	Ngomba rwose kugenda
He wanted that.	Yashakaga ibyo.
He is not here now.	Ubu ntabwo ari hano.
I knew this house.	Nari nzi iyi nzu.
I'm not sure if this is true.	Sinzi neza niba ibi ari ukuri.
No one was outside.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hanze.
You are a beautiful woman.	Uri umugore mwiza.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
Everyone wants to do it.	Umuntu wese arashaka kubikora.
I want to do something	Ndashaka gukora ikintu
You have an idea to study.	Ufite igitekerezo cyo kwiga.
He needed.	Yari akeneye.
You don't know for sure now.	Ntabwo uzi neza ubu.
I found it to be true	Nabonye ko ari ukuri
It would be nice for him.	Byaba byiza kuri we.
Someone can help.	Hari umuntu ushobora gufasha.
I guess that's not true	Ndakeka ko ibyo atari ukuri
I never saw your family here.	Sinigeze mbona umuryango wawe hano.
Not really there.	Ntabwo rwose ahari.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I should know more.	Nkwiye kumenya byinshi.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I never wanted to see that room again	Sinigeze nshaka kongera kubona icyo cyumba
He was not going to let this happen.	Ntabwo yari agiye kureka ibi.
Everything is the same.	Ibintu byose ni ikintu.
You don't have to be an expert.	Ntugomba kuba umuhanga.
Maybe he was just trying to do it.	Birashoboka ko yari yagerageje gusa kubikora.
I am a very lucky boy	Ndi umuhungu ufite amahirwe menshi
I thought he would do it	Natekereje ko azabikora
And close.	Kandi hafi.
I know what he thinks	Nzi icyo atekereza
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I thought you did the same	Natekereje ko nawe wabikoze
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You can't do it alone, but you have to do it.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine, ariko umuntu agomba kubikora.
Time.	Igihe .
I have to see things	Ngomba kubona ibintu
I needed a family.	Nari nkeneye umuryango.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo nkuko bisanzwe.
I didn’t even need to think about this	Sinari nkeneye no gutekereza kuri iyi
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, birasa.
I think it's possible	Ntekereza ko bishoboka
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
I am very happy to know that it is.	Nishimiye cyane kumenya ko aribyo.
We don't have.	Ntabwo dufite.
She is always beautiful.	Ahora ari mwiza.
You have to get out of here.	Ugomba kuva hano.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
I was not sure he knew	Sinari nzi neza ko yari azi
No good play.	Nta gukina neza.
Just what you want to do.	Gusa ibyo ushaka gukora.
He wants to come.	Ashaka kuza.
What’s more is worse.	Ikindi kandi kibi cyane.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
I'm afraid to be around her	Mfite ubwoba bwo kuba hafi ye
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
Everyone has to do it.	Umuntu wese agomba kubikora.
I have what I need.	Mfite ibyo nkeneye.
I thought you were my friend.	Natekereje ko uri inshuti yanjye.
It was a bad day at work.	Wari wari umunsi mubi ku kazi.
Here in this room.	Hano muri iki cyumba.
I think we should talk	Ntekereza ko tugomba kuvuga
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I wanted to find that house	Nashakaga kubona iyo nzu
I had faith.	Nari mfite kwizera.
He heard nothing.	Nta cyo yumvise.
He started telling me.	Yatangiye kumbwira.
I really can't wait for my hair	Ntabwo rwose nshobora gutegereza umusatsi wanjye
For three years he was useless.	Amaze imyaka itatu ntacyo yari amaze.
Ultimately, he is human.	Amaherezo, ni umuntu.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
You really don't think so.	Ntabwo rwose utekereza neza.
I thought for a moment	Natekereje gato
It was normal for me.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe kuri njye.
For him alone.	Kuri we wenyine.
I'm not sure what to think	Sinzi neza icyo ntekereza
He was the one you ever wanted.	Niwe wigeze ushaka.
Of the many, one.	Muri benshi, umwe.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
Or a problem.	Cyangwa ikibazo.
We have so many things.	Dufite ibintu byinshi cyane.
But he was human.	Ariko yari umuntu.
I can't see anything else	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikindi kintu
I really think about him	Ndatekereza rwose kuri we
I just know he has problems	Gusa nzi ko afite ibibazo
I had a lot to think about	Nari mfite byinshi byo gutekereza
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
That's not smart.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ubwenge.
I knew it was a problem.	Nari nzi ko ari ibibazo.
I didn't know where or what	Sinari nzi aho cyangwa ibyo
I like to do things on my own	Nkunda gukora ibintu wenyine
He needed more.	Yari akeneye byinshi.
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
Things he never said before.	Ibintu atigeze avuga mbere.
I feel so much right now	Ndumva byinshi cyane ubu
I think he is doing well	Ntekereza ko akora neza
But none of us did.	Ariko nta n'umwe muri twe wabikoze.
But a good person.	Ariko umuntu mwiza.
But he knew it would be enough.	Ariko yari azi ko bizaba bihagije.
I never saw his clothes	Sinigeze mbona imyenda ye
I never wanted to treat someone so badly	Sinigeze nshaka gufata umuntu nabi cyane
But that will be the problem.	Ariko ibyo bizaba ikibazo.
I was worried too	Nanjye nari mfite impungenge
Take time.	Gufata umwanya.
What you want but don't want.	Ibyo ushaka ariko udashaka.
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora.
He said that was the case.	Yavuze ko ibyo ari byo.
While we can do it, we must do it.	Mugihe dushobora kubikora, tugomba kubikora.
Something he didn't include.	Ikintu atari arimo.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
I know the truth	Nzi ukuri icyo aricyo
It was his car.	Yari imodoka ye.
You think.	Uratekereza.
All right, good.	Byose, byiza.
Something is a player.	Ikintu ni umukinnyi.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
That's right.	Ni byo.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
This was the day.	Uyu wari umunsi.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
But we don’t have that.	Ariko ntabwo dufite ibyo.
Arimo.	Arimo.
I wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza.
It's too high.	Ni hejuru cyane.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
And so far, it is.	Kandi kugeza ubu, ni.
Probably one day.	Birashoboka ko umunsi umwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
he says.	avuga.
That is a gift.	Iyo ni impano.
I think back home	Ndatekereza gusubira murugo
I was going to do it	Nari ngiye kubikora
I want my daughter to be whatever she wants	Ndashaka ko umukobwa wanjye aba icyo ashaka cyose
One person.	Umuntu umwe.
I am inside you	Ndi imbere muri wowe
Finding the truth.	Kubona ukuri.
I'm scared of him.	Mfite ubwoba kuri we.
I'm not sure, that's right	Ntabwo rwose nzi neza, nibyo
I hadn’t thought about it all	Sinari natekereje kuri byose
I know exactly what to do now	Nzi neza icyo gukora ubu
Most of the time, it’s not.	Igihe kinini, ntabwo.
I feel for him.	Ndumva kuri we.
I know them all well	Nzi neza bose
It's the same.	Ni kimwe.
I think it was good	Ntekereza ko byari byiza
I can't take anything else	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ikindi kintu
I knew nothing about it	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri ibyo
I'm not doing well out of my house	Ntabwo nkora neza kuva mu nzu yanjye
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I didn't know what to think or say	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza cyangwa kuvuga
He is obviously worried.	Biragaragara ko afite impungenge.
I really enjoyed this one	Nishimiye cyane iyi
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ahari.
We had nothing to say	Ntacyo twari dufite cyo kuvuga
I used to be inside.	Nigeze kuba imbere.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
All in all, you can go.	Byose, urashobora kugenda.
He thought	Yatekereje
What he does.	Ibyo akora.
They were nothing.	Ntacyo bari cyo.
You can do one or the other.	Urashobora gukora kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
He saw nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
I thought yesterday	Natekerezaga ejo
I just don’t like it.	Ntabwo nkunda gusa.
It's not a problem at all.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo rwose kugenda.
But here is the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
You have to walk alone.	Ugomba kugenda wenyine.
And you were right.	Kandi wari ufite ukuri.
I didn't know you could do it	Sinari nzi ko ushobora kubikora
I can't wait to go back	Sinshobora gutegereza gusubira inyuma
But not now.	Ariko si ubu.
I wanted to win.	Nashakaga gutsinda.
I thought it worked out	Natekereje ko byagenze neza
I wonder where they all are today	Ndabaza aho bose bari uyu munsi
Her daughter can see.	Umukobwa we arashobora kubona.
I didn't think so	Ntabwo natekerezaga
I'm doing very well.	Ndimo kugenda neza cyane.
The child cannot walk.	Umwana ntashobora kugenda.
I guess we don't need anything	Ndakeka ko ntacyo dukeneye
We were just kids, in fact.	Twari abana gusa, mubyukuri.
And we had.	Kandi twari dufite.
Everyone does it on time.	Umuntu wese abikora mugihe cye.
They have no chance.	Ntabwo bafite amahirwe.
He had gone to work as usual.	Yari yagiye ku kazi nk'uko bisanzwe.
And he would have nothing to ask for.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe yari gusaba.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
Something bigger than me.	Ikintu kinini kundusha.
My car started doing this.	Imodoka yanjye yatangiye gukora ibi.
He did not want to be lucky.	Ntiyashakaga kugira amahirwe.
I like to work hard.	Nkunda gukora cyane.
I can’t stay close every day	Sinshobora kuguma hafi buri munsi
I thought that was good	Natekereje ko ibyo byari byiza
I got a job	Nabonye akazi
I thought quickly	Natekereje vuba
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza cyane.
You need a player.	Ukeneye umukinnyi.
But there is something to be found.	Ariko hari ikintu ugomba kubona.
I am space.	Ndi umwanya.
And he never did anything later.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora nyuma.
I should do it.	Nkwiye kubikora.
You are walking in front of me.	Urimo kugenda imbere yanjye.
I saw it yesterday	Nabonye ejo
We have children.	Dufite abana.
I'm just one person	Ndi umuntu umwe gusa
I was so scared I didn't know what to do.	Nagize ubwoba rwose sinzi icyo gukora.
I have not seen or heard of anyone.	Nta muntu nabonye cyangwa numvise.
We were friends.	Twari inshuti.
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atabikoze.
That's right.	Nibyo.
A little problem here	Ikibazo gito hano
I thought it was good for him	Natekereje ko byari byiza kuri we
And in the end.	Kandi amaherezo.
Nothing good.	Nta kintu cyiza.
They had a lot of problems.	Bari bafite ibibazo byinshi.
At least.	Kuri gato.
Doing something good is the same.	Gukora ikintu cyiza ni kimwe.
This is not the case here.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo hano.
I was in a meeting.	Nari mu nama.
It can also be bad.	Ashobora kandi kuba mubi.
He could know nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kumenya.
But more importantly.	Ariko cyane cyane kuruta ibyo.
There is only time here.	Hano hari umwanya gusa.
Little did I know that there were many.	Sinari nzi ko hari benshi.
He does whatever he wants.	Akora icyo ashaka cyose.
I have breakfast	Mfite inama yo mu gitondo
It wasn't a problem for him but it was for me.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo kuri we ariko byari kuri njye.
Or maybe one of them.	Cyangwa ahari nka kimwe muri byo.
In fact, it's good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza.
Everyone knows the truth.	Abantu bose bazi ukuri.
I think about this, very often	Ntekereza kuri ibi, buri gihe cyane
I never thought before	Sinigeze ntekereza neza ko mbere
It's good to be together, really.	Nibyiza kubana, rwose.
I can't be here.	Ntashobora kuba hano.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
It was not me.	Ntabwo yari njye.
Not before, in fact.	Ntabwo ari mbere, mubyukuri.
I was going to do it	Nari ngiye kubikora
But I feel good about it.	Ariko numva ari byiza kubikora.
I need to do it.	Nkeneye kubikora.
I don't get the idea.	Ntabwo mbona igitekerezo.
I'm glad you were here	Nishimiye ko wari hano
I have to get out of here	Ngomba kuva hano
I want the truth	Ndashaka ukuri
I can't say for sure	Sinshobora kuvuga neza
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
But it is a small problem.	Ariko ni ikibazo gito.
This seems to be difficult, and it is.	Ibi birasa nkaho bigoye, kandi ni.
I don't feel the same way.	Ntabwo ndumva kimwe.
In fact, he didn't have to.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yagombaga.
I did nothing good	Nta kintu cyiza nakoze
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kubikora rimwe gusa.
I haven't heard much	Ntabwo numvise ibintu byinshi
I want him to look like her	Ndashaka ko asa na we
I do everything.	Nkora byose.
I was not sure what.	Sinari nzi neza icyo.
I was the first person, now	Nari umuntu wa mbere, ubu
If that is possible.	Niba ibyo bishoboka.
I guess everything is fine	Ndakeka ko byose ari byiza
I'm fine	Njye nibyiza
Reka.	Reka.
I know you mean.	Nzi ko ushaka kuvuga.
But it was probably true.	Ariko birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
I shouldn't have done that	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora
People at work.	Abantu bari ku kazi.
The only problem is your age.	Ikibazo gusa ni imyaka yawe.
This is a woman.	Uyu ni umugore.
I wonder why he does it	Ndabaza impamvu abikora
I don’t just believe what he says	Ntabwo nizera gusa ibyo avuga
There are so many things to do here.	Hano hari ibintu byinshi byo gukora hano.
I hope there is a time for everything	Nizera ko hari igihe cya buri kintu
That's right.	Nibyo.
It was a wonderful day so far.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane kugeza ubu.
I'm just glad we can go home	Nishimiye gusa ko dushobora gutaha
I feel very happy to be with her	Ndumva nishimiye cyane kubana na we
That's right, she's my wife.	Nibyo, ni umugore wanjye.
I can stay here with you	Nshobora kuguma hano hamwe nawe
But he was here.	Ariko yari hano.
He can do it.	Arashobora kubikora.
And he asked for help.	Kandi yasabye ubufasha.
Sometimes it is very obvious.	Rimwe na rimwe biragaragara cyane.
I want to stay away from him	Ndashaka kuguma kure ye
If he was his father.	Niba yari se.
Like me	Nkanjye.
But it is also good.	Ariko kandi ni mwiza.
If it were easy, everyone would win.	Niba byari byoroshye, abantu bose bari gutsinda.
I didn’t know how long he had been in me	Sinari nzi igihe yamaze muri njye
I didn't see much.	Ntabwo nabonye neza.
In many households.	Mu ngo nyinshi.
I saw something else	Nabonye ikindi kintu
Whatever he thinks.	Ibyo atekereza byose.
And he meant it all.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga ibi rwose.
I had to say	Nari ngomba kuvuga
I can't believe you did it, out here	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera ko wabikoze, hanze aha
Everything was just fine	Ibintu byose byari byiza gusa
And he is not here.	Kandi ntabwo ari hano.
I felt very happy and at home here.	Numvise nishimiye cyane kandi murugo hano.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza hamwe nibyo.
I can't even walk	Ntabwo nshobora gusa no kugenda
It's not the same thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
I think so.	Ndatekereza ko aribyo.
But he didn't go	Ariko ntabwo yagiye
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
Sometimes very often	Rimwe na rimwe cyane rimwe na rimwe
It was not easy for me.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye kuri njye.
I know that's not true.	Nzi ko atari ukuri.
He knew he had made the right choice.	Yari azi ko yahisemo neza.
Maybe they would live.	Ahari bari kubaho.
No one inside or outside.	Nta muntu n'umwe cyangwa hanze.
He was here.	Yari hano.
Swimming almost every day	Koga hafi buri munsi
I saw he saw a book	Nabonye yabonye igitabo
And this one will do it.	Kandi uyu azabikora.
I don't know if you should do it.	Sinzi niba ugomba kubikora.
If he has time.	Niba afite umwanya.
I have seen it since then	Nabonye kuva icyo gihe
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ukeneye gusa kumenya ibyo ukeneye kumenya.
I knew what he meant	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
We need to know exactly where.	Tugomba kumenya neza aho.
You want to be together.	Niwowe ashaka kubana.
Finally, the girl started walking.	Amaherezo, umukobwa yatangiye kugenda.
You now have a lot of time with us.	Ubu ufite igihe kinini hamwe natwe.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
It was as good as ever.	Byari byiza nka mbere.
It's really good.	Mubyukuri nibyiza.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
I heard it for the first time	Numvise bwa mbere
I can't eat this.	Sinshobora kurya ibi.
I think you should be	Ntekereza ko ugomba kuba
Probably everything you know.	Birashoboka ko ibyo uzi byose.
Reading hard.	Gusoma cyane.
I was just a man.	Nari umuntu gusa.
That's right now.	Nibyo kuri ubu.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
I think it will be good	Ntekereza ko bizaba byiza
This is like.	Ibi ni nka.
I don't want to do this.	Sinshaka gukora ibi.
I thought it was really good	Natekerezaga ko byari byiza rwose
This is definitely not the case.	Ibi rwose ntabwo aribyo.
I had a problem getting back here	Nagize ikibazo cyo gusubira hano
He is not going.	Ntabwo agenda.
I really wanted to	Nashakaga rwose
I saw it there.	Nabonye aho.
Something.	Ikintu.
I didn't see anything wrong	Ntabwo nabonye ikintu kibi
I do a lot of swimming	Nkora koga cyane
But only.	Ariko gusa.
I needed it this morning	Nari nkeneye iki gitondo
I can't believe he's gone	Sinshobora kwizera ko yagiye
You saw this.	Wabonye ibi.
It is your family.	Ni umuryango wawe.
There are so many.	Hariho benshi cyane.
I didn’t get a chance to play	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe yo gukina
I never saw that.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo.
We have to be.	Tugomba kuba.
I would make sure he had everything he needed	Nari kumenya neza ko afite ibyo akeneye byose
It was a great experience to see.	Byari ibintu byiza kubona.
I never heard of the plan	Sinigeze numva gahunda

And he had a family.	Kandi yari afite umuryango.
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
He got it right	Yabonye neza rwose
Everything was in order.	Byose byari muri gahunda.

Existence is real.	Kubaho ni ukuri.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose
I highly doubt they would have	Ndashidikanya cyane ko bari kugira
I hope he knew them all	Ndizera ko yari azi bose
'	'
He admitted it was a good idea.	Yemeye ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine.	Niba udashaka kuvuga, nibyiza.
I just thought he had a great day	Gusa natekereje ko afite umunsi mwiza
The only thing you can do.	Ikintu gusa ushobora gukora.
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
I can't really wait	Sinshobora gutegereza mubyukuri
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I don't know how old he is.	Sinzi imyaka afite.
I have to stop this	Ngomba guhagarika ibi
I thought you might have	Natekerezaga ko ushobora kuba ufite
I was thinking about coming home	Nari natekereje kubyo gutaha
He went first.	Yagiye mbere.
I thought he looked exactly like he was wearing his clothes	Natekereje ko asa neza neza yambaye imyenda ye
I knew it was a good thing to do	Nari nzi ko ari ikintu cyiza cyo gukora
It was not a mistake.	Ntabwo byari amakosa.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
He thought this was my house.	Yatekereje ko iyi ari inzu yanjye.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira ukuri.
I would eventually go	Nari kugenda amaherezo
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Everything.	Byose.
Every night and every night.	Buri joro na buri joro.
Maybe this was true.	Ahari ibi byari ukuri.
And the thing is not you.	Kandi ikintu atari wowe.
This is absolutely possible	Ibi birashoboka rwose
From there, we can find out why.	Kuva aho, dushobora kumenya impamvu ikibazo.
I thought it was a lot	Natekereje ko ari byinshi
Like.	Nka.
Everyone is inside.	Abantu bose bari imbere.
I'm glad it's there	Nishimiye ko ahari
Much to learn.	Byinshi byo kwiga.
It's always a bad idea.	Buri gihe ni igitekerezo kibi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, afite impamvu.
It's your day.	Ni umunsi wawe.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
I didn’t want to see anyone	Sinifuzaga kubona umuntu
I didn't think so	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo
It’s not just money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga gusa.
I have to talk to someone.	Ngomba kuvugana numuntu.
I never heard him speak so much.	Sinigeze numva avuga cyane.
What he said is not true.	Ibyo yavuze ntabwo ari ukuri.
And more.	Kandi byinshi.
But it’s not just bad.	Ariko ntabwo ari mubi gusa.
It was a good thing	Byari ibintu byiza
Each of them.	Buri kimwe muri byo.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
You are too.	Nawe uri.
I've done this before.	Nagize ibi mbere.
Money is very possible.	Amafaranga birashoboka cyane.
I didn't know he was your friend.	Sinari nzi ko ari inshuti yawe.
I thought you wanted to be my friend	Natekereje ko ushaka kuba inshuti yanjye
When you have problems.	Iyo ufite ibibazo.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
I saw her well dressed	Nabonye yambaye neza
She wanted to be one as a child.	Yashakaga kuba umwe akiri umwana.
I love what he does	Nkunda ibyo akora
He was scared too.	Na we yari afite ubwoba.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
I didn’t want to, I can’t go back	Ntabwo nashakaga, sinshobora gusubira inyuma
I thought you might be far away	Natekereje ko ushobora kuba uri kure
I was not sure what he was feeling	Sinari nzi neza icyo yumva
He really wanted to talk.	Yashakaga cyane kuvuga.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Only his dog.	Imbwa ye gusa.

I am not and I cannot be.	Ntabwo ndi kandi sinshobora kubaho.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
But he is right.	Ariko afite ukuri.
'	'
Maybe I have enough	Birashoboka ko mfite ibintu bihagije
I'm not really good	Ntabwo rwose ndi mwiza
Too much work.	Gukora cyane.
There is a lot to know here.	Hano hari byinshi byo kumenya hano.
He makes cars to do what he likes.	Akora imodoka gukora ibyo akunda.
But that’s just the thing.	Ariko ni ibintu gusa.
I also know that he is right.	Nzi kandi ko afite ukuri.
Obviously that is not the case here.	Biragaragara ko atari ko byagenze hano.
Luckily he didn't.	Yagize amahirwe sibyo.
He asked for advice.	Yasabye inama.
He has money.	Afite amafaranga.
I really need to talk to you	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana nawe
This is it.	Ni iyi.
That's all.	Ibyo byose ni byo.
I was out here	Nari hanze aha
I am here almost every day	Ndi hano hafi buri munsi
I didn't see it at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo nabonye.
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
You, not me.	Wowe, ntabwo ari njye.
I know what you need.	Nzi icyo ukeneye.
I didn’t know what he might be thinking	Sinari nzi icyo ashobora kuba atekereza
You don't know what to do.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo gukora.
I didn't need to say much	Sinari nkeneye kuvuga byinshi
I have to know what he wants	Ngomba kumenya icyo ashaka
It would be a bad time for him.	Byaba ari umwanya mubi kuri we.
I was a girl.	Nari umukobwa.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
When he was at work.	Igihe yari ku kazi.
I think that's what it is	Ntekereza ko aribyo aribyo
It was easy, it was good, he was.	Byari byoroshye, byari byiza, ni we.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
He knows wisdom very well.	Azi ubwenge neza.
And he wants to talk.	Kandi arashaka kuvuga.
I was young.	Nari ngiye muto.
You can't imagine that.	Ntushobora gutekereza uko.
I needed to go and see what he needed	Nari nkeneye kujya kureba ibyo akeneye
It wasn't really good at the time.	Ntabwo rwose byari byiza icyo gihe.
But he never did, he never did anything wrong to me.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze, nta na rimwe yigeze akora amakosa kuri njye.
I think early tonight	Ndatekereza kuri kare iri joro
I should try to talk	Nkwiye kugerageza kuvuga
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I didn’t get a chance to be scared	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kugira ubwoba
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
He thought he was the only one.	Yatekerezaga ko yari umuntu wenyine.
I really hope you can do that	Ndizera rwose ko ushobora kubikora
He has a plan to do so.	Afite gahunda yo kubikora.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
He had to be good, he had to be.	Yagombaga kuba mwiza, yagombaga kuba.
But not much of it.	Ariko nta byinshi muri byo.
He is working hard and doing well on his own.	Arimo gukora cyane kandi akora neza wenyine.
I was really scared	Nagize ubwoba rwose
You have to be a young woman.	Ugomba kuba umugore muto.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta n'umwe ufite.
I really didn't want to be here	Sinifuzaga rwose kuba hano
I thought you were going to stop	Natekereje ko ugiye guhagarika
That's right.	Byari byo.
I can't figure out who you are.	Sinshobora kumenya uwo uri we.
He is a wise child.	Ni umwana uzi ubwenge.
I can go fast	Nshobora kugenda vuba
And in fact it is not.	Kandi mubyukuri sibyo.
And you can help.	Kandi urashobora gufasha.
And that's right	Kandi nibyo
He chose to stay.	Yahisemo kuguma.
I think it was good enough	Ndakeka ko byari byiza bihagije
I have to do this	Ngomba gukora ibi
I know exactly where it is	Nzi neza aho ari
Or you can't live.	Cyangwa ntushobora kubaho.
I want to play.	Ndashaka gukina.
He would not go without it.	Ntiyari kugenda adafite.
This is a lot.	Ibi ni byinshi.
He wants to go.	Ashaka kugenda.
Everything about him was.	Ibintu byose kuri we byari.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
I want to know.	Ndashaka kumenya.
I'm sure you want your house	Nzi neza ko ushaka inzu yawe
One thing is for sure.	Ikintu kimwe ni uko.
You may want to go just as usual.	Urashobora gushaka kugenda gusa nkuko bisanzwe.
I don't know why	Ntabwo nzi impamvu ibi
I needed to work	Nari nkeneye gukora
I work hard and I like to play a lot	Nkora cyane kandi nkunda gukina cyane
Maybe it was a family or a loved one.	Birashoboka ko yari umuryango cyangwa uwo ukunda.
Not a good day for him.	Ntabwo ari umunsi mwiza kuri we.
I think it’s simple and normal	Ntekereza ko byoroshye kandi bisanzwe
None of this he did.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo yakoze.
Make money.	Gushaka amafaranga.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
I really think you should go now	Ndatekereza rwose ko ugomba kugenda ubu
I was like him.	Nari nka we.
Since then, nothing.	Kuva icyo gihe, ntacyo.
I can't say much	Sinshobora kuvuga byinshi
I mean really, really	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri, mubyukuri
I know he didn't mean anything	Nzi ko ntacyo yashakaga kuvuga
He was here, and near him.	Yari hano, kandi hafi ye.
I didn’t see people.	Ntabwo nabonye abantu.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
Maybe it was a mistake to come here today.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa kuza hano uyu munsi.
He knew how to do it.	Yari azi kubikora.
I have nothing to do	Ntacyo mfite cyo gukora
One can believe.	Umuntu ushobora kwizera.
To marry	Gushaka.
I didn't want to be here	Sinifuzaga kuba hano
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo ari cyo
I think there is something you need to see	Ntekereza ko hari ikintu ugomba kubona
How to work	Uburyo bwo gukora
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
I didn't know how to do it.	Ntabwo nari nzi gukora.
I was not very lucky	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe cyane
They also have a little inside	Bafite kandi imbere gato
I shouldn't think so	Ntabwo nkwiye gutekereza gutya
He did what he wanted.	Yakoze ibyo yashakaga.
That's fine now.	Nibyiza ubu.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
I was about to give up when he agreed	Nari ngiye kureka igihe yemeye
He thought he was going.	Yatekereje ko agiye.
That's not what he wanted to hear.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga kumva.
He was not his father.	Ntabwo yari se.
I want to say more.	Ndashaka kuvuga byinshi.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikintu kinini.
I hope it's good.	Nizere ko ari byiza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Someone had to be there.	Umuntu yagombaga kuba ahari.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He meant now.	Yashakaga kuvuga ubu.
I know exactly who his father is	Nzi neza se uwo ari we
No one	Nta muntu n'umwe
He did nothing.	Nta cyo yakoze.
Especially the girl.	Cyane cyane umukobwa.
He knew what he wanted to hear.	Yari azi icyo yashakaga kumva.
He can do what he wants to do.	Arashobora gukora icyo ashaka gukora.
I don't want to get married again.	Sinshaka kongera gushaka.
I don’t know where they were, or if they were.	Ntabwo nzi aho bari, cyangwa niba, bari.
I like a lot.	Nkunda byinshi.
No one knew where he was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho ari.
He thought about what to do.	Yatekereje icyo gukora.
He was probably gone.	Birashoboka ko yari yagiye.
In one week.	Mu cyumweru kimwe.
He said there was nothing wrong with that.	Yavuze ko nta kibi rwose.
I knew exactly who he was	Nari nzi neza uwo ari we
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
This one should stay alone.	Uyu agomba kuguma wenyine.
I wanted to see where.	Nashakaga kureba aho.
I'm glad we're friends now	Nishimiye ko ubu turi inshuti
I don’t know where he wanted to go.	Sinzi aho yashakaga kujyana.
It's not down.	Ntabwo ari hasi.
I didn't have to go	Sinari nkwiye kugenda
But that is not all.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo rwose.
This is a good time.	Iki ni igihe cyiza.
You have another problem.	Ufite ikindi kibazo.
I can do it.	Nshobora gukora.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
I mean, that's not really the case	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo aribyo rwose
I was not sure of anything	Ntabwo nari nzi neza ikintu na kimwe
You didn't see it.	Ntabwo wabonye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
At work.	Ku kazi.
That's good !!.	Nibyiza !!.
I thought he would do it.	Natekereje ko azabikora.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
No one had the idea to speak.	Nta n'umwe wari ufite igitekerezo cyo kuvuga.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I want to be home	Ndashaka kuba murugo
I can't go far	Sinshobora kujya kure
I saw nothing	Nta na kimwe nabonye
I really enjoy the job	Nishimiye cyane akazi
I mean, that’s not it, really	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo aribyo, rwose
I have to try this.	Ngomba kugerageza ibi.
Where he was supposed to be.	Aho yagombaga kuba.
I think it's good to have a lot of money.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza ufite amafaranga menshi.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
You are a good thing.	Wowe ikintu cyiza.
And you can't go back to that.	Kandi ntushobora gusubira muri ibyo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I have never seen anything so beautiful.	Sinigeze mbona ikintu cyiza cyane.
You have to do everything.	Ugomba gukora byose.
I am everything else	Ndi ikindi kintu cyose
It's good to be together.	Nibyiza kubana.
He was not the one he wanted, he knew a lot.	Ntabwo yari uwo yashakaga, byinshi yari azi.
I haven't worked since.	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze nkora.
And that's fine.	Kandi nibyiza.
I shouldn't have gone that far	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugenda gutya
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
Saying things.	Kuvuga ibintu.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
That's what he wanted.	Nibyo yashakaga.
But that’s not a good idea.	Ariko ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
Everyone knows if that is the case.	Umuntu wese uzi niba aribyo.
I had nothing to say.	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo kuvuga.
I really didn't want to go	Sinifuzaga rwose kugenda
I can't feel better here	Sinshobora kumva neza hano
No one ever did.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze akora.
To be so beautiful.	Kuba mwiza cyane.
I needed to find my daughter	Nari nkeneye gushaka umukobwa wanjye
I didn't quite understand what he meant	Sinigeze numva neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga
I would say a lot.	Nari kuvuga byinshi.
I'm behind you, man.	Ndi inyuma yawe, muntu.
It would be a problem if.	Byaba ikibazo niba.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
That's not a bad idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi.
I did well	Nakoze neza
He needed to drink.	Yari akeneye kunywa.
He was an expert in everything.	Yari umuhanga cyane muri byose.
I want to stay.	Ndashaka kuguma.
He is three years old.	Afite imyaka itatu.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza
That's right.	Nibyo ibi.
But in reality.	Ariko mubyukuri.
I have to do it.	Ngomba kubikora.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He saw that world	Yabonye iyo si
If you want.	Niba ushaka.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
I am really happy to be here now	Nishimiye rwose kuba ndi hano ubu
This is probably not true.	Ibi birashoboka ko atari ukuri.
But there is a reason.	Ariko hari impamvu.
I hadn’t thought about this	Sinari natekereje kuri ibi
You probably had the truth.	Birashoboka ko wari ufite ukuri.
A good gift is time, not money.	Impano nziza ni igihe, ntabwo ari amafaranga.
I just want to see all this together	Gusa ndashaka kubona ibi byose hamwe
I can live for the first time	Nshobora kubaho bwa mbere
This is just like.	Ibi birasa gusa.
Bari.	Bari.
That's exactly what you have.	Nibyo rwose ufite.
I just didn’t feel like I had the time	Gusa sinigeze mbona ko mfite umwanya
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda na gato
Very good on top.	Nibyiza cyane hejuru.
I want to know everything	Ndashaka kumenya byose
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
But we have a little time.	Ariko dufite igihe gito.
I don't see anyone	Nta muntu mbona
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
Maybe he'll do it.	Birashoboka ko azabikora.
He had money.	Yari afite amafaranga.
You can't say why.	Ntushobora kuvuga impamvu.
I knew it wasn't him	Nari nzi ko atari we
This is not an idea.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
I thought you needed more questions	Natekerezaga ko ukeneye ibibazo byinshi
In that case, it is possible.	Icyo gihe, birashoboka.
Run tonight.	Kuri iri joro.
He may be.	Ashobora kuba.
I don't know where you're going.	Ntabwo nzi aho ugiye.
He had gone too far.	Yari yagiye kure cyane.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
And that's the problem.	Kandi ibyo ni ikibazo.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I was very far away.	Nari kure cyane.
Everyone wanted to help.	Umuntu wese yashakaga gufasha.
'	'
I know exactly where we are now	Nzi neza aho turi ubu
Not many people.	Ntabwo abantu benshi.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
At the time, I didn't think much of it	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga neza
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
I'm sure he will	Nzi neza ko azabikora
I always know what you mean	Buri gihe nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga
And that is it.	Kandi ibyo ni ibi.
I am not your wife.	Ntabwo ndi umugore wawe.
You can really see how difficult it was.	Urashobora rwose kubona uburyo ibintu byari bigoye.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I am grateful for the help	Nishimiye ubufasha
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
None of us have an idea where to look.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ufite igitekerezo aho ugomba kureba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I was bad	Ninjye wari mubi
Question.	Ikibazo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He is right.	Yaba afite ukuri.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
I know what you mean	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga
And later.	Na nyuma.
I have no problem with that	Nta kibazo mfite kuri ibyo
He did not expect the truth.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ukuri.
I wanted the truth.	Nashakaga ukuri.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
People have cars.	Abantu bafite imodoka.
I thought it would be nice	Natekereje ko byaba byiza
I need to hear what happened	Nkeneye kumva uko byagenze
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I am absolutely nothing	Ntacyo ndi cyo rwose
I'm not sure	Ntacyo nzi neza
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Read well.	Gusoma neza.
They don't know what happened.	Ntabwo bazi uko byagenze.
I saw this.	Nabonye ibi.
You are scared.	Ufite ubwoba.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
I hope he feels the same way.	Nizera ko yumva ibintu kimwe.
I was not here	Ntabwo nari hano
Everyone thinks so.	Umuntu wese atekereza ko aribyo.
Being good is not good enough.	Kuba mwiza ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
I'm close.	Ndi hafi.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first	Ibyo ari byo byose nari nzi neza
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
Maybe you can do it right.	Ahari ushobora kubikora neza.
I needed to know more beforehand	Nari nkeneye kumenya byinshi mbere
He chose what he wanted to do.	Yahisemo icyo yashakaga gukora.
He knew why.	Yari azi impamvu.
Here are some of the ones I found to be interesting:	Hano hari ibintu byiza cyane.
You want	Urashaka.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He went out for a long time.	Yagiye hanze igihe kirekire.
I am not an expert on this subject	Ntabwo ndi umuhanga kuri iki kibazo
I had never seen a girl like her before	Sinigeze mbona umukobwa nka we mbere
He knows nothing.	Nta kintu atazi.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
He can schedule now.	Arashobora gukora gahunda ubu.
I didn't know what to think	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza
I didn't need food.	Sinari nkeneye ibiryo.
You have your time, and that's it.	Ufite umwanya wawe, kandi nibyo.
But there are many mistakes.	Ariko hariho amakosa menshi.
I have no problem finding a job.	Ntabwo mfite ikibazo cyo kubona akazi.
I need to know that he is young.	Ngomba kumenya ko ari muto.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
But the woman he loved.	Ariko umugore yakundaga.
He said.	Yavuze.
But it is not good.	Ariko si byiza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, yari, ariko gato.
He thought he could do better.	Yatekereje ko ashobora gukora neza.
I should have tried to go.	Nari nkwiye kugerageza kugenda.
He must know this for me.	Agomba kumenya ibi kuri njye.
I can be anything.	Nshobora kuba icyo ari cyo cyose.
He did not do very well.	Ntabwo yakoze neza cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I really enjoyed this one.	Nishimiye cyane iyi.
I thought it was really good	Natekereje ko byari byiza rwose
I think that's a good idea.	Ntekereza ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ufite impungenge gusa.
I didn't know what happened	Sinari nzi uko byagenze
And that's right!	Kandi ibi ni byo!.
I wanted him to have time	Nashakaga ko agira umwanya
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I have many children	Mfite abana benshi
I think that's hard.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bigoye.
They were actually very far away.	Mubyukuri bari kure cyane.
I thought.	Natekereje.
But now he could see more in the room, he said.	Yavuze ko ariko ubu yashoboraga kubona byinshi mu cyumba.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
I like to know everything that is possible	Nkunda kumenya neza ibintu byose bishoboka
He needed more.	Yari akeneye byinshi.
Never, never, never.	Nta na rimwe, na rimwe, na rimwe.
I didn't know what he meant.	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I didn’t know there was so much	Sinari nzi ko hari byinshi
That's what the family does.	Nibyo umuryango ukora.
But he had to listen.	Ariko yagombaga kumva.
Not much right now.	Ntabwo ari byinshi ubu.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari ukuri.
Very bad thing.	Ikintu kibi cyane.
I just wanted to say	Nashakaga kuvuga gusa
I don't know what it is	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo
You want	Urashaka.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
I have a daughter	Mfite umukobwa
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
And they were right.	Kandi bari bafite ukuri.
I have a lot to say	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga
Time to make money.	Igihe cyo gushaka amafaranga.
But he knows something.	Ariko hari icyo azi.
You are friends	Uri inshuti.
How can I do that?	Nigute nshobora kubikora.
That's what everyone looks like.	Nibyo buri wese asa.
It is my house.	Ni inzu yanjye.
She is beautiful.	Ari mwiza.
But it is just fear.	Ariko ni ubwoba gusa.
I can't wait to be down	Sinshobora gutegereza kuba hasi
Probably.	Birashoboka.
And that's exactly what he said.	Kandi ibyo ni byo yavuze.
Things you do.	Ibintu ukora.
He could be all that.	Ashobora kuba ibyo byose.
What he should be.	Icyo agomba kuba.
Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
I don't want to watch.	Ntabwo nshaka kureba.
I didn't know what to do before	Sinari nzi icyo gukora mbere
Not now, not tonight.	Ntabwo ari ubu, si iri joro.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
I just can't.	Sinshobora gusa.
It's good inside.	Nibyiza imbere.
I have to do it right	Ngomba kubikora neza
You have to go now.	Ugomba kugenda ubu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
He really wouldn't do that.	Nukuri ntabwo yari kubikora muri ibi.
He went to work.	Yagiye ku kazi.
And he.	Na we.
That's exactly what he had in mind.	Nibyo rwose yari afite ukuri.
Everyone is here.	Abantu bose bari hano.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
And down.	Kandi hasi.
He came to his senses.	Yaje aho ari.
I think you know exactly what it is.	Ntekereza ko uzi neza icyo aricyo.
I didn't know what else to do	Sinari nzi ikindi gukora
It is not difficult to see why this is so.	Ntabwo bigoye kubona impamvu ibi aribyo.
But the big problem.	Ariko ikibazo kinini.
I was not going to give up	Ntabwo nari ngiye kureka
I think that's a good idea.	Ntekereza ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I can go to jail	Nshobora kujya muri gereza
I knew it was only once tonight	Nari nzi ko iri joro rimwe gusa
You can't go back.	Ntushobora gusubira inyuma.
I feel like I'm here.	Numva ndi hano hano.
I was not sure what he meant	Sinari nzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga
I was not, in fact	Ntabwo nari ndi, mubyukuri
Sometimes you are going to do it.	Rimwe na rimwe ugiye kubikora.
I can't claim that it's not my fault	Ntabwo nshobora gusaba ko atari amakosa yanjye
Anyone could live with that.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kubana nibyo.
To do so.	Kubikora.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
He was there longer than I was.	Yari ahari igihe kirekire kundusha.
Time to be together.	Igihe cyo kubana.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I never heard him go	Sinigeze numva agenda
I think he was young	Ndatekereza ko yari muto
This one is not.	Uyu ntabwo.
I just wanted to be me	Nashakaga gusa kuba njye
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
You and I tonight.	Ni wowe na njye muri iri joro.
The house is close by.	Inzu ni hafi.
I don't know what happened	Sinzi uko byagenze
I thought it was true.	Natekerezaga ko ari ukuri.
I can't find time out here	Ntabwo nshobora kubona umwanya hanze aha
I thought that was a good thing.	Natekereje ko ibyo byagenze neza.
I hope that is possible	Ndizera ko ibyo bishoboka
Things would be better.	Ibintu byaba byiza.
I'm not sure what to do.	Sinzi neza icyo gukora.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Eventually it has to go.	Amaherezo agomba kugenda.
I like food.	Nkunda ibiryo.
I thought a lot	Natekerezaga cyane
I was not good at this	Ntabwo nari mwiza kuri ibi
It went together easily.	Yagiye hamwe byoroshye.
I don't want easy friends.	Ntabwo nshaka inshuti byoroshye.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kuvugana n'umwe.
Looks like someone is out.	Birasa nkaho umuntu ari hanze.
He hopes.	Yizeye.
I knew he had a job to do.	Nari nzi ko afite akazi agomba gukora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I didn't want to be with him	Sinifuzaga kubana na we
He can also.	Ashobora kandi.
I have received a wonderful gift.	Nabonye impano nziza cyane.
He tried but couldn't get out of this.	Yagerageje ariko ntashobora kuva muri iyi.
Maybe today I am a woman	Birashoboka ko uyu munsi ndi umugore
It's the same.	Ni kimwe.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba gukora neza.
I know it's not just me.	Nzi ko atari njye gusa.
Really smart kids.	Nukuri abana bafite ubwenge.
He went.	Yagiye.
At the same time, we have to go home.	Igihe kimwe, tugomba gusubira murugo.
I don't know at all.	Sinzi na gato.
That was not what he was thinking.	Ntabwo byari ibyo yatekerezaga.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikintu kinini cyane.
Same thing with him.	Ikintu kimwe na we.
We are one.	Turi umwe.
I didn't do enough	Ntabwo nakoze bihagije
I was an idea.	Nari igitekerezo.
I can't take this anymore	Sinshobora kongera gufata ibi
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
Now is the time to work.	Ubu ni igihe cyo gukora.
I needed to work fast.	Nari nkeneye gukora vuba.
I couldn't do it	Sinari nshobora kubikora
But it was too much.	Ariko byari byinshi cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I didn’t want everyone	Sinifuzaga ko abantu bose
I don't know who he was	Sinzi uwo yari we
He is not one of us.	Ntabwo ari umwe muri twe.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
Drinking fast enough was hard.	Kunywa vuba bihagije byari ibintu bigoye.
I should have won, here	Nari nkwiye gutsinda, hano
But he doesn’t need to do it.	Ariko ntabwo akeneye kubikora.
It's together.	Ni hamwe muri hamwe.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko.
I can't see who he is.	Sinshobora kubona uwo ari we.
But he did not ask questions.	Ariko nta kibazo yabajije.
I knew in that look that he had succeeded	Nari nzi ko ibyo yavuze byose aribyo
To see	Kubona.
My wife.	Umugore wanjye.
Nice to meet you	Nishimiye kubana nawe
But not me.	Ariko si njye.
I have the same problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe
I really like this good.	Mubyukuri nkunda ibi byiza.
It was all my fault.	Byose byari amakosa yanjye.
I have money.	Mfite amafaranga.
I didn’t think anyone was down	Sinatekerezaga ko hari umuntu uri hasi
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
Everyone knew it from a young age	Umuntu wese yari azi kuva akiri muto yari yagiye
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
He was better than that.	Yari mwiza kuruta ibyo.
I need to do this	Nkeneye gukora ibi
I have a big problem with that	Mfite ikibazo kinini kuri ibyo
This is like a new movie.	Iyi ni nka firime nshya.
You are doing something really good.	Urimo gukora ibintu byiza rwose.
I saw that he was just scared.	Nabonye ko afite ubwoba gusa.
But he had to.	Ariko yagombaga.
I think we can do that	Ntekereza ko dushobora kubikora
Something overdue.	Ikintu cyo kurenza igihe.
Reka.	Reka.
I needed a job and a place to live	Nari nkeneye akazi n'aho kuba
I can't live like that	Sinshobora kubaho gutya
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, uko ibintu byagenze.
In the end, it is possible.	Amaherezo, birashoboka.
I know you can.	Nzi ko ushobora.
I didn't have one	Ntabwo nari mfite
Tell me a little bit about that.	Mbwira gato kuri byo.
In fact, he was thinking of doing it.	Mubyukuri, yatekerezaga kubikora.
I don't see anything wrong with that	Nta kintu mbona kibi
He tried to say something on his own.	Yagerageje kuvuga ikintu wenyine.
You are alone	Mubyukuri uri wenyine
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
I don't need to know what happened	Ntabwo nkwiye kumenya uko byagenze
I saw what he was feeling	Nabonye icyo yumva
I feel nothing	Ntacyo numva
Maybe you have good things to do, too.	Birashoboka ko ufite ibintu byiza byo gukora, nawe.
I was scared, I was really scared	Nagize ubwoba, rwose mfite ubwoba
It was a way to make money.	Byari uburyo bwo kubona amafaranga.
You knew what you were seeing.	Wari uzi ibyo urimo kubona.
My daughter was really nice.	Umukobwa wanjye yari mwiza cyane mubyukuri.
I just can't figure out what the plan is	Gusa sinshobora kumenya gahunda icyo aricyo
I have to go find my daughter	Ngomba kujya gushaka umukobwa wanjye
This is the first day.	Ubu munsi ya mbere.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I know nothing about him	Ntacyo nzi kuri we
I had to wait.	Nari nkwiye gutegereza.
I feel very happy with what happened	Ndumva nishimiye cyane uko byagenze
You have to talk to him.	Ugomba kuvugana nawe.
I was not sure what to do or say	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora cyangwa kuvuga
That someone was me.	Ko umuntu yari njye.
I want to do this and we can do that.	Ndashaka gukora ibi kandi dushobora kubikora.
And, he was a good guy.	Kandi, yari umusore mwiza.
That would have been normal.	Ibyo byari kuba ari ibintu bisanzwe.
And you can get a chance to read a book.	Kandi urashobora kubona amahirwe yo gusoma igitabo.
This, however, was easier said than done.	Ibi ariko, byari byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
I want it to be easy to see and read.	Ndashaka ko byoroshye kubona no gusoma.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
But he did things.	Ariko yakoze ibintu.
It was not a reason.	Ntabwo yari impamvu.
I was not sure he would do it	Sinari nzi neza ko azabikora
They are above you.	Bari hejuru yawe.
It’s not your family, you.	Ntabwo ari umuryango wawe, wowe.
But I don't think so.	Ariko ntatekereza ko aribyo.
I can't wait.	Sinshobora gutegereza.
I don’t just find time with me	Ntabwo mbona umwanya hamwe nanjye gusa
He sat next to her.	Yicaye hafi ye.
You are not scared or anything else.	Ntabwo ufite ubwoba cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
He admitted it was a good idea.	Yemeye ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
He went on to win.	Yagiye gutsinda.
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I never saw what it was	Sinigeze mbona icyo aricyo
Quit.	Kureka.
But in reality it is not.	Ariko mubyukuri sibyo.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I did the same	Ninjye wabikoze
That will not be good.	Ibyo ntabwo bizaba byiza.
He was not.	Ntiyari.
He should not.	Ntabwo agomba.
You can't say anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushobora kuvuga.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza
But they have the truth.	Ariko bafite ukuri.
I hope you told the truth	Nizera ko wavuze ukuri
He then picked up the phone.	Icyo gihe yafashe terefone.
This is true.	Ibi nibyo.
One thing is for sure.	Ikintu kimwe ni ukuri.
Congratulations to my friend	Nishimiye inshuti yanjye
The boy knew a lot.	Umuhungu yari azi byinshi.
he said.	yavuze.
I thought maybe	Natekereje ko ahari
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ufite byinshi ushaka kumbwira nta.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
I know when to give up	Nzi igihe cyo kureka
I can't have everything	Sinshobora kugira byose
You can't see anything.	Ntushobora kubona ikintu.
I have a job to help my family	Mfite akazi ko gufasha umuryango wanjye
I don't want to.	Ntashaka.
Like a good movie.	Nka firime nziza.
The little boy behind him, his son	Umuhungu muto inyuma ye, umuhungu we
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
And he did it very well	Kandi ibyo yabikoze neza cyane
You can't say anything.	Ntushobora kuvuga ikintu na kimwe.
I should work.	Nkwiye gukora.
And he doesn’t have to be a guy here.	Kandi ntabwo agomba kuba umusore hano.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I mean, really bad.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubi rwose.
I know what he needs	Nzi icyo akeneye
And he probably has the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
Not much to say.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo kuvuga.
I guess that's the problem	Ndakeka ko aricyo kibazo
I am something else	Nanjye ndi ikindi kintu
They had enough.	Bari bafite bihagije.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
It is not true.	Ntabwo ari kuri.
I think he was a good person.	Ntekereza ko yari umuntu mwiza.
And here.	Kandi hano.
He thought of everything.	Yatekereje kuri byose.
It's a good time.	Ni igihe cyiza.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
I really like what happened	Nkunda cyane uko byagenze
I thought you should be here.	Natekereje ko ugomba kuba hano.
For the first time.	Bwa mbere.
I didn't know what to say	Sinari nzi icyo avuga
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye gukora.
I wanted to say more	Nashakaga kuvuga byinshi
I enjoyed watching.	Nishimiye kureba.
I feel very distant	Numva ndi kure cyane
He was not present at the meeting.	Ntabwo yari muri iyo nama.
He started to get very good.	Yatangiye kugira neza cyane.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I'm not doing all that	Ntabwo ndimo gukora ibyo byose
People just have more.	Abantu bafite byinshi gusa.
I didn't know they were here	Sinari nzi ko bari hano
I did wrong	Nakoze nabi
I feel there is a lot	Ndumva hari byinshi
I think he probably isn’t the only one.	Ntekereza ko bishoboka ko atari we wenyine.
I was just scared.	Nari mfite ubwoba gusa.
I need to do where he went.	Nkeneye gukora aho yagiye.
Or his gift.	Cyangwa impano ye.
If they are lucky.	Niba bafite amahirwe.
I never liked that	Sinigeze nkunda ibyo
Everyone knows everyone.	Abantu bose bazi abantu bose.
It was a great experience to see	Byari ibintu byiza kubona
Working on the ground.	Gukora hasi.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
I don't want to waste time together.	Sinshaka guhagarika umwanya hamwe.
But you don't have to tell anyone.	Ariko ntugomba kubwira umuntu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He did not want to tell the truth.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga ukuri.
I have no plans, really	Nta gahunda mfite, mubyukuri
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu
I don't think you can.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ushobora.
I can live alone	Nshobora kubaho wenyine
You have to look and feel.	Ugomba kureba no kumva.
But that's exactly what you have to do.	Ariko ibyo nibyo rwose ugomba gukora.
Not one, many.	Ntabwo ari umwe, benshi.
I know you want to help	Nzi ko ushaka gufasha
I can have everything	Nshobora kugira byose
He's a smart guy.	Ni umusore uzi ubwenge.
I am a very good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza cyane.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
He wanted to come from then on.	Yashakaga kuza kuva icyo gihe.
He went in the morning.	Yagiye mu gitondo.
I really think we should talk.	Ndatekereza rwose ko tugomba kuvuga.
The girl is sitting on the floor	Umukobwa yicaye hasi
We can't figure out why	Ntidushobora kumenya impamvu
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
It is clear that, whenever money, i.	Biragaragara neza ko, igihe cyose amafaranga, i.
All but nothing.	Byose ariko ntacyo.
I wanted to see what you were doing	Nashakaga kureba ibyo urimo gukora
All of this is good and simple.	Ibi byose nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
He was worried about me.	Yari afite impungenge kuri njye.
That's me	Uwo ni njye.
But he needed a car.	Ariko yari akeneye imodoka.
Maybe find time.	Birashoboka kubona umwanya.
It was easier than that.	Byari byoroshye kuruta ibyo.
Everything will be fine	Byose bizaba byiza
It would be nice for both of them.	Byaba byiza kuri bombi.
I have to be a good person	Ngomba kuba umuntu mwiza
But you are my wife.	Ariko uri umugore wanjye.
She needs to hear.	Akeneye kumva.
I shouldn't have come here.	Sinari nkwiye kuza hano.
One can live happily ever after.	Umuntu ushobora kubana neza.
This is probably true.	Birashoboka ko ibi ari ukuri.
This is a great thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza cyane.
I don't want any of me.	Ntabwo nshaka n'umwe muri njye.
But there is something else first.	Ariko hari ikindi kintu cya mbere.
Of course, I am	Nukuri, rwose, ndi
You just got to give up.	Wabonye gusa kureka.
I need something big	Nkeneye ikintu kinini
In the morning	Mu gitondo.
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka hano.
He was obviously an expert.	Biragaragara ko yari umuhanga cyane.
I just guess.	Gusa ndakeka.
We were not close, but we were friends.	Ntabwo twari hafi, ariko twari inshuti.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
I wanted to know what he was thinking.	Nashakaga kumenya icyo yatekerezaga.
I didn't think about it	Ntabwo natekereje kuri ibi
I want to be a guy	Ndashaka kuba umusore
Almost in high season.	Hafi mugihe cyo hejuru.
I think he wanted to try	Ntekereza ko yashakaga kugerageza
I shouldn’t have done that	Sinari nkwiye kubikora
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza, byose nibyiza.
His time.	Igihe cye.
I was not on the bus	Ntabwo nari muri bisi
I have nothing to say.	Ntacyo mfite cyo kuvuga.
I didn't think about it	Ntabwo natekereje kuri ibi
I wanted to try the last thing	Nashakaga kugerageza ikintu cya nyuma
I'm not really good at it	Ntabwo rwose ndi mwiza kandi mwiza
If you want to be a problem.	Niba ushaka kuba ikibazo.
A lot of things to do.	Ibintu byinshi byo gukora.
I have a good plan	Mfite gahunda nziza
Thinking together.	Gutekereza hamwe.
I need advice.	Nkeneye inama.
I just thought you might know.	Gusa natekereje ko ushobora kumenya.
There is not much to it.	Nta byinshi kuri byo.
I can't live like that	Sinshobora kubaho gutya
There is so much here.	Hano hari byinshi cyane.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
We have hair.	Dufite umusatsi.
I really need to talk to you	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana nawe
She is a woman.	Arimo kuba umugore.
I think they both have the truth	Ntekereza ko bombi bafite ukuri
I didn't want to talk to anyone	Sinifuzaga kuvugana n'umuntu uwo ari we wese
Everyone was outside.	Abantu bose bari hanze.
And this is a bad thing.	Kandi iki ni ikintu kibi.
I always hope that tomorrow will be better.	Buri gihe nizera ko ejo bizaba byiza.
Not good enough.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
In any case, it will not be a problem.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo bizaba ikibazo.
But it happened very quickly.	Ariko byagenze vuba cyane.
Almost daily.	Hafi ya buri munsi.
I am right.	Ndi ukuri.
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane, mwiza cyane.
But you can too.	Ariko nawe urashobora.
I thought of one thing, while he thought of another	Natekereje ku kintu kimwe, mu gihe we yatekerezaga ikindi
He has to do it on his own.	Agomba kubikora wenyine.
I don’t know when he can wait.	Ntazi igihe ashobora gutegereza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I knew it was wrong	Nari nzi ko atari byo
I really can't have a housewife	Ntabwo rwose nshobora kugira umukobwa wo murugo
I had a little boy.	Nari mfite umuhungu muto.
I really enjoyed the book	Nishimiye cyane igitabo
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
But this is not the case.	Ariko iki ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
That's right- this is about it.	Nibyo, byiza kandi byiza.
We don't have to stay here.	Ntabwo tugomba kuguma hano.
And they were right	Kandi bari bafite ukuri
He was good to man.	Yari mwiza ku muntu.
And this is exactly what you want to do.	Kandi ibi nibyo rwose udashaka gukora.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
He is not right.	Ntabwo afite ukuri.
I think that's what we can do right now	Ntekereza ko aribyo dushobora gukora kuri ubu
I have nothing to say.	Ntacyo nshaka kuvuga.
I didn't need to.	Sinari nkeneye.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
It's bad.	Ari mubi.
It's early in the morning.	Hari mu gitondo cya kare.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
I am very sorry for the inconvenience.	Mbabajwe cyane n'iki kibazo.
I'm out now.	Ubu ndi hanze.
I was very close.	Nari hafi yanjye cyane.
I had a lot of problems	Nari mfite ibibazo byinshi
Never before.	Nta na rimwe mbere na rimwe.
I never heard what he said.	Sinigeze numva ibyo yavuze.
I can't wait for that.	Sinshobora gutegereza ibyo.
It is best to try something else	Nibyiza kugerageza ikindi kintu
If any.	Niba hari.
The beautiful woman was alone	Umugore mwiza yari hejuru wenyine
It looks like a reversal.	Birasa nkaho gusubira inyuma.
I mean, we're just friends, and you were right	Ndashaka kuvuga, turi inshuti gusa, kandi wari ufite ukuri
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He had nothing.	Ntacyo yari afite.
Very good question.	Ikibazo cyiza cyane.
Question.	Ikibazo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kuri twe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
I like to say a lot about everything	Nkunda kuvuga byinshi kuri byose
I'm happy to help.	Nishimiye gufasha.
But he never heard of it.	Ariko nta na kimwe yigeze yumva.
And, good reason.	Kandi, impamvu nziza.
I can't stop doing this	Sinshobora guhagarika gukora ibi
I want to be with you	Ndashaka kubana nawe
No one had an idea.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite igitekerezo.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I knew it was going to be a big deal.	Nari nzi ko bizaba ikintu kinini.
I feel it will happen.	Ndumva bizaba.
No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe yavuze.
I am young and beautiful	Ndi muto kandi mwiza
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I'm glad to be your friend	Nishimiye kuba inshuti yawe
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I don’t think they are human.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ari abantu.
The truth is that he chose to leave.	Ukuri ni uko yahisemo kugenda.
I needed to take something.	Nari nkeneye gufata ikintu.
You don't have to go far.	Ntugomba kujya kure.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He is very young.	Ari muto cyane.
I think so	Ntekereza ko aribyo
I wanted to leave	Nashakaga kuva aho
He knew it was a good idea.	Yari azi ko ari inama nziza.
Just what he had hoped for.	Gusa ibyo yari yizeye.
You have to look carefully	Ugomba kureba neza
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
Most of the time not.	Igihe kinini ntabwo.
But he heard something else.	Ariko yumvise ikindi kintu.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
That was good enough.	Ibyo byari byiza bihagije.
Also in the meeting.	No mu nama.
Both are on the phone.	Bombi bari kuri terefone.
It went wrong.	Byagenze nabi.
I mean	Ndashaka kuvuga
I was just thinking	Natekerezaga gusa
He seemed to know what to do.	Yasaga naho azi icyo gukora.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I can't believe you're beautiful	Sinshobora kwizera ko uri mwiza
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Tell me the truth.	Mbwira ukuri.
I knew it from the beginning	Nari nzi kuva mbere
I really wanted to do it	Nashakaga kubikora mubyukuri
I could never do that	Sinigeze nshobora kubikora
But we had no reason.	Ariko nta mpamvu twari dufite.
I need food	Nkeneye ibiryo
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
I thought about this	Natekereje kuri ibi
It's not really normal.	Ntabwo rwose ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I'm glad he did	Nishimiye ko yabikoze
I think he's going to leave	Ndatekereza ko agiye kugenda
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
I am the only one who is small	Ninjye wenyine muto muto
You know it's true.	Uzi ko ari ukuri.
I didn’t think it was a good idea	Sinatekerezaga ko ari igitekerezo cyiza
I know a lot.	Nzi neza byinshi.
That's great	Nibyiza cyane
you think	uratekereza.
Everything is possible here.	Byose birashoboka hano.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Maybe he can do something after all.	Birashoboka ko ashobora kugira icyo akora nyuma ya byose.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
For me.	Kuri njye.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
And it was.	Kandi byari byo.
I think we can do more and better.	Ntekereza ko dushobora gukora byinshi kandi byiza.
Someone had to.	Umuntu yagombaga.
You know nothing.	Ntacyo uzi.
And that for me is a problem.	Kandi ibyo kuri njye ni ikibazo.
Nothing for me.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri njye.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
It wouldn't have happened now.	Ntabwo byari kubaho ubu.
I hope you have a great day	Nizere ko wabonye umunsi mwiza
I understand why	Ndumva impamvu
He loved it here.	Yakundaga hano.
He has to go fast.	Agomba kugenda vuba.
You have to listen !!!.	Ugomba kumva !!!.
You can't say it now.	Ntushobora kuvuga nonaha.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nuko yashakaga.
It's you	Ni wowe.
I really was.	Nari njye rwose.
He seemed to be doing nothing	Yasaga naho ntacyo akora
If he had anything.	Niba hari icyo yari afite.
If you can hear.	Niba ushobora kumva.
I worked hard on that film.	Nakoze cyane kuri iyo firime.
But we must.	Ariko tugomba.
At that point he saw the problem.	Icyo gihe yabonye ikibazo.
He did.	Yabikoze.
I wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kugenda
She wanted to be with him.	Yashakaga kubana na we.
I have a lot of that.	Mfite byinshi muri byo.
You can even be friends.	Urashobora no kuba inshuti.
Not now, but back then, it was.	Ntabwo ari ubu, ariko icyo gihe, byari.
I didn't really know	Ntabwo nari nzi mubyukuri
That's all.	Byose, nuko.
How can you go wrong?	Nigute ushobora kugenda nabi?.
Anyone can do it.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
He had a job to do now.	Yari afite akazi ko gukora ubu.
We have nothing here.	Hano nta kintu na kimwe dufite.
I was well aware of the mistakes	Nari nzi neza amakosa
I have an idea where he might be	Mfite igitekerezo aho ashobora kuba
I'm going back to work.	Ngiye gusubira ku kazi.
The space is behind.	Umwanya uri inyuma.
You can do one or the other.	Urashobora gukora kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
I think he must have been out	Ntekereza ko agomba kuba yari hanze
I never did a job	Ntabwo nigeze nkora akazi
He had no time to think.	Ntiyari afite umwanya wo gutekereza.
I just wanted to know	Nashakaga kumenya gusa
And you are me.	Kandi uri njye.
I wonder if he does	Ndabaza niba abikora
Good boy, good boy	Umwana mwiza, umuhungu mwiza
After all, it was nothing.	Nyuma, nta cyo byari cyo.
I should have lived with him too	Nanjye nari nkwiye kubana na we
I think he is a good person	Ntekereza ko ari umuntu mwiza
Something we need.	Ikintu dukeneye.
I want to have a family with you	Ndashaka kugira umuryango hamwe nawe
I'm not sure what to do	Sinzi neza icyo gukora
No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze avuga.
But more.	Ariko byinshi.
Probably not just money.	Birashoboka ko atari amafaranga gusa.
But it's really good.	Ariko ni byiza rwose.
I can do one of those	Nshobora gukora kimwe muri ibyo
I thought about it a lot.	Natekereje cyane kuri ibyo.
Inside he felt scared	Imbere muri we yumva afite ubwoba
I had a small drinking problem	Nagize ikibazo gito cyo kunywa
I don't know now.	Sinzi ubu.
Later.	Nyuma.
He was in.	Yari arimo.
I didn't know where he was	Sinari nzi aho ari
And so far so good.	Kandi kugeza ubu byagenze neza cyane.
I know what he wants to do	Nzi icyo ashaka gukora
Maybe everything would be fine.	Ahari ibintu byose byaba byiza.
And here we are.	Kandi hano turi.
For this reason, too.	Iyi mpamvu, kandi.
One can have a good idea.	Umuntu arashobora kugira igitekerezo cyiza.
Until the time comes.	Kugeza igihe cyo gukora.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
I wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe
This is a good thing, though.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza, ariko.
Everything we have.	Ibyo dufite byose.
I think it's great.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza cyane.
You don’t know how to do it all.	Ntabwo uzi uburyo bwo gukora byose.
I really wanted to go	Nashakaga rwose kugenda
The guy.	Umusore.
I can't figure out how to do it	Sinshobora kumenya uko abikora
I have never found an easy friend	Sinigeze mbona inshuti byoroshye
I have to work on it	Ngomba gukora kuri yo
I can't say one bad thing.	Sinshobora kuvuga ikintu kimwe kibi.
Get it today !.	Kubona uyu munsi!.
It worked out in a short time.	Byagenze neza mugihe gito.
I knew we could do it.	Nari nzi ko dushobora kubikora.
I am one of many	Ndi umwe muri benshi
I got back to work	Nabonye gusubira ku kazi
You really got this.	Wabonye ibi rwose.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
I have to.	Ninjye ugomba.
Well, now you can.	Nibyiza, ubu urashobora.
People are not.	Abantu ntabwo.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
And that is not a good thing.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
Anyone have any idea.	Umuntu wese igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose.
He needs good things.	Akeneye ibintu byiza.
I used to think.	Natekerezaga gutekereza.
This was all but true.	Ibi byari byose ariko ni ukuri.
A wonderful gift for us	Impano nziza kuri twe
That will be enough for now.	Ibyo bizaba bihagije kuri ubu.
Women.	Akazi.
But you were young.	Ariko wari muto.
I'm not sure.	Ntazi neza.
I had the same problem.	Nari mfite ikibazo kimwe.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
I was well aware of all this	Nari nzi neza ibyo byose
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
But most of all.	Ariko cyane cyane.
But this was true.	Ariko ibi byari ukuri.
Or that.	Cyangwa ibyo.
It doesn't look very good.	Ntabwo asa cyane.
That's not really the case.	Ntabwo rwose aricyo kibazo.
I thought about it almost every day	Natekerezaga hafi buri munsi
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
He was a dog.	Yari imbwa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Waiting to see.	Gutegereza kubona.
I didn't know you looked like that	Sinari nzi ko usa
Something.	Ikintu.
But we have a problem.	Ariko dufite ikibazo.
That's exactly what he likes.	Nibyo akunda rwose.
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kugenda
Good player.	Umukinnyi mwiza.
But let it be.	Ariko reka reka.
What he did was good.	Ibyo yakoze byari byiza.
Baby.	Umwana.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I have nothing to say	Ntacyo mfite cyo kuvuga
Anyone can trust their child.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese ashobora kwizera umwana we.
But he was happy to take the money.	Ariko yishimiye gufata amafaranga.
Until his day.	Kugeza ku munsi we.
Near the first.	Hafi ya mbere.
You can earn a lot of money in a short time.	Ibi urashobora kubona amafaranga menshi mugihe gito.
Near and far.	Hafi na kure.
I hope each of us can	Ndizera ko buri wese muri twe ashobora
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
We didn't need the money.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye amafaranga.
But not all.	Ariko si bose.
I'm not going to back down	Ntabwo ngiye gusubira inyuma
You have to say it's good.	Ugomba kuvuga ko ari byiza.
He would know the family.	Yari kumenya umuryango.
I was not sure what to do this morning	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora muri iki gitondo
I really like the way you think	Mubyukuri nkunda uburyo utekereza
He just thought he was young.	Yatekereje gusa ko ari muto.
I saw it very well and very well	Nabonye neza neza neza neza neza neza neza
He was a man in his thirties.	Yari umuntu ufite imyaka mirongo itatu.
I feel behind me	Ndumva inyuma yanjye
I was looking for something else	Nashakaga ikindi kintu
She was a girl.	Yari umukobwa.
It's not a small thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu gito.
He would not go.	Ntabwo yari kugenda.
It could have been better for him.	Yashoboraga kuba mwiza kuri we.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
Time to do as he pleases.	Umwanya wo gukora uko ashaka.
I know it's not my fault	Nzi ko atari amakosa yanjye
He got the best advice in that regard.	Yabonye inama nziza cyane muri ibyo.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
He did not ask much about this	Ntabwo yabajije byinshi kuri ibi
She is scared to think.	Afite ubwoba bwo gutekereza.
But he is right, we need to get out of here.	Ariko afite ukuri, dukeneye kuva hano.
I didn't know how to do it	Sinari nzi gukora
I need the truth first	Nkeneye ukuri mbere
I thought it would be nice	Natekereje ko byaba byiza
He wanted to stay there.	Yashakaga kuguma aho.
I think he had something	Ndatekereza ko hari ikintu yari afite
In fact, only.	Mubyukuri, gusa.
I was close to him at the time	Icyo gihe nari hafi ye hejuru ye
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was just a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza gusa.
I can't think straight	Sinshobora gutekereza neza
I think he can stay here	Ndatekereza ko ashobora kuguma hano
I have another problem	Mfite ikindi kibazo
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
This is not the case.	Ntabwo ari iyi.
But.	Ariko.
I got the money.	Nabonye amafaranga.
No one ever did.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze akora.
But only.	Ariko gusa.
I just want to be your friend	Ndashaka kuba inshuti yawe gusa
I understand the plan	Ndumva gahunda
I'm not sure	Ntabwo nzi neza rwose
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
Why we are.	Kuki turi.
It's a short time.	Ni igihe gito.
Family together.	Umuryango hamwe.
You never liked it here.	Ntabwo wigeze ukunda hano.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibintu byose.
From man.	Kuva ku muntu.
I was the closest thing they had to a boy	Ninjye kintu cya hafi bari bafite umuhungu
You know where to look.	Uzi aho ugomba kureba.
He never felt close to helping.	Ntiyigeze yumva ko ari hafi yo gufasha.
I know what he meant	Nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
I need to find the truth	Nkeneye kubona ukuri
I wonder if it's easy	Ndabaza niba byoroshye
One I thought of.	Umwe natekereje.
He was here to watch, or to watch.	Yari hano kureba, cyangwa kureba.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
This is obviously not the case.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari byo.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
I made no mistake	Ntabwo nagize amakosa
He didn't have much money.	Ntabwo yari afite amafaranga menshi.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
But he will do it, he will do it.	Ariko azabikora, azabikora.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He was well aware of the plan.	Yari azi neza iyo gahunda.
'he said.	' yavuze.
He could do anything he wanted.	Yashoboraga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose yashakaga.
It seems easy.	Birasa naho byoroshye.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
But you have to do things.	Ariko ugomba gukora ibintu.
We are many of us.	Turi benshi muri twe.
We have nothing.	Ntacyo dufite.
I can't see that.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ibyo.
Her son needs help.	Umuhungu we akeneye ubufasha.
I can't believe he did it.	Sinshobora kwizera ko yabikoze.
This is a family.	Uyu ni umuryango.
I guess you have too	Ndakeka ko nawe ufite
I was not someone I wanted to see.	Ntabwo nari umuntu yashakaga kubona.
You are not here.	Ntabwo waba uri hano.
In time.	Mugihe.
You're going to do it as much as possible.	Ugiye kubikora bishoboka.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane.
I don't have to be scared	Ntabwo ngomba kugira ubwoba
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose
You think you're doing well.	Utekereza ko ukora neza.
And you have.	Kandi ufite.
I knew nothing about it	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi imbere
That's it.	Iyo ni yo.
I need to stop working	Nkeneye guhagarika gukora
I didn't want to know anything else	Sinifuzaga kumenya ikindi
I need to take more	Nkeneye gufata byinshi
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I don't know anyone here	Nta muntu nzi hano
I didn't know where he was	Sinari nzi aho ari
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I know what you can do	Nzi icyo ushobora gukora
And not much.	Kandi si byinshi.
He seemed worried.	Yasaga naho afite impungenge.
I wanted to go back to that	Nashakaga gusubira kuri ibyo
She has to be home by now.	Agomba kuba murugo kugeza ubu.
A short time.	Igihe gito.
Money could buy everything he needed.	Amafaranga yashoboraga kugura ibyo akeneye byose.
I could go farther	Nshobora kujya kure kuruta ibi
And it's true that you can.	Kandi ni ukuri rwose ko ushobora.
He doesn't want to talk.	Ntabwo ashaka kuvuga.
I don't want to work.	Sinshaka gukora.
But he loved it so much.	Ariko yakundaga hejuru cyane.
I know exactly what he is thinking	Nzi neza icyo atekereza
You know you did.	Uzi ko wabikoze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko kuri we, twari.
It's stuff.	Ni ibintu.
I need to go back to work	Nkeneye gusubira ku kazi
You can't see.	Ntushobora kubona.
Maybe this was a mistake.	Ahari ibi byari amakosa.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
This is what it is.	Iki ni iki.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I should have talked to you	Nari nkwiye kuvugana nawe
I guess not much	Ndakeka ko atari byinshi
I hope no one is behind me	Nizere ko nta muntu uri inyuma yanjye
Nothing.	Ntacyo.
I saw the dog well	Nabonye imbwa neza
I was not a good woman	Ntabwo nari umugore mwiza
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I have many friends.	Mfite inshuti nyinshi.
I didn’t want you to think badly	Sinifuzaga ko utekereza nabi
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
But that was not enough.	Ariko ntabwo byari bihagije.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari aha.
In fact, he probably didn't know what to think.	Mubyukuri, birashoboka ko atari azi igitekerezo cye.
The house was beautiful.	Inzu yari nziza.
I knew that was what he meant	Nari nzi ko aricyo yashakaga kuvuga
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
I have to have time to think	Ngomba kugira umwanya wo gutekereza
I didn’t think it was good to trust anyone	Sinatekerezaga ko ari byiza kwizera umuntu uwo ari we wese
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
You may find it difficult.	Urashobora kumva ko bigoye.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
Good to see.	Nibyiza kubona.
I understand the idea.	Ndumva igitekerezo.
He did.	Yabikoze.
You don't have to do that.	Ntagomba kubikora.
If you are reading this and you are not here.	Niba urimo gusoma ibi kandi ntabwo uri hano.
To do so.	Kubikora.
Obviously, we all need money.	Biragaragara, twese dukeneye amafaranga.
But he had found a friend.	Ariko yari yabonye inshuti.
I feel it every day	Numva buri munsi
I thought it was a problem	Natekerezaga ko ari ikibazo
I really need to know everything now	Nkeneye rwose kumenya byose ubu
I'm really sorry	Mbabajwe rwose nibyo
This time.	Iki gihe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo birasa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
This is my daughter.	Ubu ni umukobwa wanjye.
I was one.	Nari umwe.
And he was gone.	Kandi yari yagiye.
I could never have had one of those in the back	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kugira kimwe muri ibyo inyuma
I could never figure out his point	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kumenya igitekerezo cye
I did nothing	Ntacyo nakoze
We are closer than time.	Turi hafi kurenza igihe.
I'm sure we can win there	Nzi neza ko dushobora gutsinda aho
I heard something above me	Numvise ikintu hejuru yanjye
I thought he would do well	Natekerezaga ko yari gukora neza
I'm not going to do that	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora
But it looks good on me.	Ariko birasa neza kuri njye.
I needed to do everything right again	Nari nkeneye kongera gukora ibintu byose neza
Waba.	Waba.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
I guess they have	Ndakeka ko bafite
And sometimes it’s an opportunity.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe ni amahirwe.
Apparently he was expecting this.	Biragaragara ko yari yiteze ibi.
It was a great day.	Biragaragara ko ari umunsi mwiza.
I think maybe you can do it	Ntekereza ko ahari ushobora kubikora
He just took off his clothes.	Yafashe imyenda gusa.
For both, in fact.	Kuri bombi, mubyukuri.
I'm really worried.	Mfite impungenge rwose.
He feels the same way.	Yumva ikintu kimwe.
This is probably the most difficult thing to think about.	Ibi birashoboka ko aribyo bigoye gutekereza mbere.
There is a lot of opportunity here.	Hano hari amahirwe menshi.
I'm glad to be here	Nishimiye kuba ndi hano
I don't think that's possible.	Ntabwo mbona ko bishoboka.
Nothing.	Ntacyo.
I didn't want to hear it again	Sinifuzaga kongera kumva
I wonder how he did it	Ndabaza uko yabikoze
I didn't know you were here	Sinari nzi ko uri hano
I need to be in you.	Nkeneye kuba muri wowe.
But that is not all.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He told the child to eat.	Yabwiye umwana kurya ibiryo.
Nor is it in this world.	Ntabwo ari no kuri iyi si.
She was very beautiful at the time.	Icyo gihe yari mwiza cyane.
Near you.	Hafi yawe.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I don't believe there is	Ntabwo nizera ko hariho
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I have something to do	Mfite icyo gukora
I didn’t think much of him	Ntabwo natekerezaga cyane kuri we
I would go	Nari kugenda
It’s a family, just a family.	Ni umuryango, umuryango gusa.
He just feels it.	Yumva gusa.
It will be.	Bizaba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I have a job to do, and so do you	Mfite akazi ko gukora, kandi nawe
Here is something to do while waiting.	Hano hari icyo gukora mugihe cyo gutegereza.
I am not a child.	Ntabwo ndi umwana.
It was not a job.	Ntabwo byari akazi.
Who, the best so far.	Ninde, byiza cyane kugeza ubu.
I wanted more.	Nashakaga byinshi.
I think everyone is possible.	Ndakeka ko abantu bose bishoboka.
I can't take what he says	Sinshobora gufata ibyo avuga
You have to read the book.	Ugomba gusoma igitabo.
A little closer than he wanted	Hafi gato kurenza uko yashakaga
She is not a girl.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa.
And this morning.	Kandi muri iki gitondo.
I think that's all you have to do	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo byose ugomba gukora
I need to do it soon	Nkeneye kubikora vuba
He said he was not.	Yavuze ko atari we.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
I would go home.	Nari gutaha.
Not your favorite.	Ntabwo ari uwo ukunda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bombi bari bafite.
You were the same.	Wowe na we wari umwe.
I need you to do something	Nkeneye ko ukora ikintu
I had no problem with that	Ntabwo nagize ikibazo kuri ibyo
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
As you did.	Nkuko wabikoze.
I didn't know he was	Sinari nzi ko ari we
I also made new friends.	Nanjye nabonye inshuti nshya.
I never got the time	Sinigeze mbona umwanya
The food was good.	Ibiryo byari byiza.
Or is it all.	Cyangwa byose ni.
He didn't do it early yesterday.	Ntabwo yabikoze kare ejo.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
I think so.	Ndatekereza ko aribyo.
I wonder what is really possible	Ndabaza icyo bishoboka rwose
You like to do it.	Ukunda kubikora.
I saw.	Nabonye.
That would be too much.	Ibyo byaba ari byinshi cyane.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
It seems to have worked out.	Birasa nkaho byagenze neza.
You are going to a girl.	Ugiye umukobwa.
There are things you can do.	Hariho ibintu ushobora gukora.
I mean, it was just an idea	Ndashaka kuvuga, byari igitekerezo gusa
My friend is on schedule right now.	Inshuti yanjye iri muri gahunda kuri ubu.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
That would be later.	Ibyo byaba nyuma.
I was worried.	Nagize impungenge.
I want to be a better person	Ndashaka kuba umuntu mwiza
Quit.	Kureka.
There are many problems.	Hariho ibibazo byinshi.
This is very good.	Iyi ni nziza cyane.

I wanted to do it	Nashakaga kubikora
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari mwiza.
You are nothing to me.	Ntacyo uri kuri njye.
Until then, everything is fine.	Kugeza icyo gihe, ibintu byose ni byiza.
This, however, is not really the case.	Ibi ariko, mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.

That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I should have said a lot	Nari nkwiye kuvuga ibintu byinshi
You have to try this on your own.	Ugomba kugerageza ibi wenyine.
He watched now.	Yarebye ubu.
It was close to him.	Byari hafi kuri we.
Or for me.	Cyangwa kuri njye.
He said something else.	Yavuze ikindi kintu.
I didn't know how to go	Sinari nzi kugenda
I wanted more for him	Nashakaga byinshi kuri we
He seemed young.	Yasaga naho akiri muto.
And the truth is.	Kandi ukuri ni uko.
I made a lot of mistakes	Nakoze amakosa menshi
Everything was great.	Ibintu byose byari byiza cyane.
I was not sure what to do	Sinari nzi neza icyo kubikora
He chose to take what he wanted.	Yahisemo gufata icyo yashakaga.
It's bad.	Ni mubi.
Hopefully or something.	Yizeye cyangwa ikindi kintu.
No one ever did.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze akora.

And there are many and many of us.	Kandi hariho byinshi kandi byinshi muri twe.

I can never be with him again	Sinshobora kongera kubana na we
It's here.	Ndi hano.

But this.	Ariko ibi.
I never told anyone	Ntabwo nigeze mbwira umuntu
He works for the first time all the time.	Akora bwa mbere buri gihe.
She may have had a baby by now.	Birashoboka ko yari afite umwana kugeza ubu.
I feel nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe numva
He went yesterday.	Yagiye ejo.

He was close.	Yari hafi.
I knew it all the time	Nari nzi igihe cyose
I don't know what it is	Sinzi icyo aricyo

There is another problem.	Hariho ikindi kibazo.
I know he's a good guy.	Nzi ko ari umusore mwiza.

I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe na we.
I'm not sure what the big deal is	Ntabwo nzi neza ikibazo kinini
On that day.	Kuri uwo munsi.
He had nothing to do with it.	Ntacyo yari afite cyo kubikora.
I was so scared I wanted to go home	Nagize ubwoba cyane nshaka gutaha
It's a car.	Ni imodoka.
Let's leave the little girl.	Reka reka umukobwa muto.
And he took the time.	Kandi yafashe umwanya.
He did not know what he wanted.	Ntiyari azi icyo yashakaga.
He can wait.	Arashobora gutegereza.
I think you have to go	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kugenda
They have a lot of problems.	Bafite ibibazo byinshi.

That's right.	Nibyo.
What he had.	Icyo yari afite.
I just never saw that one	Gusa sinigeze mbona uwo
I want to be home.	Ndashaka kuba murugo.
This is obviously not the same thing.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari ikintu kimwe.

He just said it right.	Gusa yavuze neza.
I didn't know he was here	Sinari nzi ko ari hano
I want to leave here.	Ndashaka kuva hano.
I like simple things.	Nkunda ibintu byoroshye.
I have never seen such a beautiful baby	Sinigeze mbona umwana mwiza cyane
You really have to.	Ugomba rwose.
I had a plan.	Nari mfite gahunda.
And that was good for me.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza kuri njye.

You can't find easy things.	Ntushobora kubona ibintu byoroshye.
I want to know everything now	Ndashaka kumenya byose ubu
He had not gone to school.	Ntabwo yari yagiye ku ishuri.
I can't think of it right now	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri ubu
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, ni byiza cyane.
It hasn't been very long.	Ntabwo yamaze igihe kinini cyane.
There is something about that.	Hariho ikintu kuri ibyo.
He had a daughter.	Yari afite umukobwa.
I didn't know what to do with it	Sinari nzi icyo gukora muri ibi
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's all.	Ni byose.
I didn't need anything for him	Ntacyo nari nkeneye kuri we
For me it was my child, my child.	Kuri njye yari umwana wanjye, umwana wanjye.
I hope you have the truth	Ndizera ko ushobora kuba ufite ukuri
But he had a reason.	Ariko yari afite impamvu.
She was a woman.	Yari umugore.
I didn’t know he was a player	Sinari nzi ko ari umukinnyi
He had.	Yari afite.
He is going to be an actor.	Agiye kuba umukinnyi.
I never heard of that	Sinigeze numva ibyo
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
I wanted to be human	Nashakaga kuba umuntu
I'm not here right now.	Ntabwo ndi hano ubu.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ikintu na kimwe
He is your favorite.	Ni wowe akunda.

That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.

He asked.	Yabajije.
But they were right about the house.	Ariko bari bafite ukuri ku nzu.
I am very good at it.	Ndi mwiza cyane muri byo.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
This is very true.	Ibi ni ukuri cyane.
I saw.	Nabonye.
Today it is not.	Uyu munsi sibyo.
It was something to think about.	Byari ikintu cyo gutekereza.
In us.	Muri twe.
For him it was not.	Kuri we ntabwo yari.
Hano hano.	Hano hano.
But for many, this is true.	Ariko, kuri benshi, ibi nukuri.
I thought about staying and reading.	Natekereje kuguma no gusoma.
I want to know everything you know	Ndashaka kumenya ibintu byose uzi
There was not much in the house for breakfast.	Nta byinshi byari mu nzu byo kurya mu gitondo.
That's right	Nibyo rwose
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we yari.
I have nothing to say.	Ntacyo nshaka kuvuga.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
I was not sure what	Sinari nzi neza icyo
I needed time to think.	Nari nkeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
But that was good for him.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza kuri we.

He did all he had to do.	Yakoze ibyo yagombaga gukora byose.
I was scared all the time	Nagize ubwoba igihe cyose
I was very lucky	Nagize amahirwe menshi
You have to be in this.	Ugomba kuba muri iyi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I never had time to do this	Sinigeze mbona umwanya wo gukora ibi
He never heard what it was	Ntabwo yigeze yumva icyo ari cyo
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
Every day.	Buri munsi.

He had everything for him.	Yari afite byose kuri we.
I need something good	Nkeneye ikintu cyiza
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I wanted to be clear.	Nashakaga kuvuga neza.
Someone.	Umuntu.
I said a lot	Nigeze kuvuga byinshi
I understand this problem	Ndumva iki kibazo
We always need gifts.	Buri gihe dukeneye impano.
Getting to know people up here.	Kumenya abantu hejuru hano.
I guess so	Ndakeka ko aribyo
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
I can definitely be good at that	Nshobora rwose kuba mwiza kuri ibyo
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
It's good to be back.	Nibyiza gusubira.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
She is afraid to do anything else.	Afite ubwoba bwo gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
I love living here with you	Nkunda kubana hano nawe
I never got the money	Ntabwo nigeze mbona amafaranga
He was one of me and always will be.	Yari umwe muri njye kandi buri gihe yari kuba.
I can't think of it now	Sinshobora gutekereza nonaha
I wanted to know.	Nashakaga kumenya.
There is a time.	Hariho igihe.
This is not easy to do.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye gukora.
He can think.	Arashobora gutekereza.
I don't think I'm the best at everything.	Ntabwo mbona ko ndi mwiza cyane muri byose.
I have the idea of ​​having one.	Mfite igitekerezo cyo kugira kimwe.
He must first buy time.	Mbere na mbere agomba kugura igihe.
I was now on top of him	Ubu nari hejuru ye
There is no truth.	Nta kuri.
I wouldn't know how to do it alone	Ntabwo nari kumenya kubikora wenyine
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
He had tried to do it right.	Yari yagerageje kubikora neza.
I'm scared of everything.	Mfite ubwoba kuri byose.
He wanted her to do well.	Yashakaga ko akora neza.
But now he has problems.	Ariko ubu afite ibibazo.
He is.	Ni we.
I was not difficult.	Ntabwo nari bigoye.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I am the right person	Ndi umuntu ukwiye
I know she is beautiful, and beautiful	Nzi ko ari mwiza, kandi mwiza
It's almost here.	Ari hafi hano.
You think so.	Utekereza ko aribyo.

Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
We have work to do.	Dufite akazi tugomba gukora.
I can't say what he wants	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo ashaka
He can't tell the truth.	Ntashobora kuvuga ukuri.
Not now, not here.	Ntabwo ari ubu, si hano.
You can walk or you can stay.	Urashobora kugenda cyangwa urashobora kuguma.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko byari byiza
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
I didn't know anyone	Ntabwo nari nzi umuntu
We are not wrong.	Ntabwo turi amakosa.
I mean really, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
Everyone had an idea.	Umuntu wese yari afite igitekerezo.
I love this one very much.	Nkunda iyi cyane.
He never understood how he could have been so young.	Ntiyigeze yumva uburyo yashoboraga kugira akiri muto.
I'm a bad guy.	Ndi umusore mubi.
I want to know the truth	Ndashaka kumenya ukuri
We may never know what to do.	Birashoboka ko nta na hamwe dushobora kumenya icyo gukora.
But you did.	Ariko wabikoze.
Maybe you want to make a movie or something.	Birashoboka ko ushaka gukora firime cyangwa ikindi.
I'm not going back with you	Ntabwo ndimo gusubira inyuma nawe
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.

I was well aware	Nari nzi neza
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
I had nothing to say at home.	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga murugo.

I really don't think so	Ndizera rwose ko atari byo
He just has to.	Agomba gusa.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
I should have seen that coming	Nari nkwiye kubona ko kuza

I can’t think of anyone as good as him	Sinshobora gutekereza umuntu wese mwiza nka we
Long time no see.	Igihe kirekire, gutegereza.
You were so beautiful to me.	Wari mwiza cyane kuri njye.
Right now, however, he had a job to do.	Kuri ubu, ariko, yari afite akazi ko gukora.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
I feel really bad	Ndumva mubi rwose
I realized that he was never alone	Nabonye ko atigeze aba wenyine
I could never do that	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kubikora
Take a good look.	Kureba neza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I don’t know if any of that is true	Sinzi niba hari kimwe muri byo ari ukuri
I just want to be friends	Ndashaka kuba inshuti gusa
You are not sure what he needed.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo yari akeneye.
I needed to do something now	Nari nkeneye gukora ikintu ubu
I can't win.	Ntabwo nshobora gutsinda.
He was not very worried.	Ntiyari afite impungenge nyinshi.

This time around everything went well.	Iki gihe ibintu byose byagenze neza.

I thought that was all.	Natekereje ko aribyo byose.
I mean, really	Ndashaka kuvuga ko mubyukuri
It was early and he was out.	Nari kare kandi yari hanze.

It would be nice	Byaba byiza
I wanted to stay here for a while	Nashakaga kuguma hano igihe gito
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Isn't that right?	Ntabwo aribyo?.
It was not a plan.	Ntabwo yari gahunda.
Mostly, in fact.	Byinshi, mubyukuri.
He lived in a new house.	Yaba mu nzu nshya.
But we are not.	Ariko ntabwo turi.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
You know he did it.	Uzi ko yabikoze.

He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
But he did not say.	Ariko ntiyigeze avuga.
Before he could do anything, he would walk away.	Mbere yuko agira icyo akora, yari kugenda.
She was a very beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza cyane.
I want to go with him	Ndashaka kujyana na we
I shouldn't have come here	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuza hano
And down.	Kandi hasi.
One cannot know for sure.	Umuntu ntashobora kumenya neza.
Going to actually tell everyone.	Kugenda mubyukuri kubwira abantu bose.
I thought so too	Nanjye nari natekereje
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, byari ukuri.
You don't know what.	Ntabwo uzi icyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He was one young man.	Yari umusore umwe.
I have nothing to say, but it is good.	Ntacyo mfite cyo kuvuga, ariko nibyiza.
Today is the day.	Uyu munsi ni umunsi.
It is not my age.	Ntabwo ari imyaka yanjye.
It was always easy.	Buri gihe byari byoroshye.
Up and down.	Hejuru no kure.
Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy.	Umuhungu mubi, mubi, mubi.
I am here if you need anything	Ndi hano hano niba hari icyo ukeneye

And that is good for me.	Kandi ibyo kuri njye ni byiza.
Just a lot of questions.	Gusa ibibazo byinshi.
I was never ashamed	Sinigeze numva isoni
I am grateful for the help	Nishimiye ubufasha
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I was very embarrassed	Nagize isoni cyane
I hope we can be good friends!	Nizere ko dushobora kuba inshuti nziza!
But there was something he needed to do now.	Ariko hari ikintu yari akeneye gukora ubu.
I didn't know what he looked like	Sinari nzi uko asa
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.

I have something you can help	Mfite ikintu ushobora gufasha
I want a cookie.	Ndashaka kuki.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
No one was in front of him	Nta muntu n'umwe wari imbere ye
This is what he expected.	Ibi nibyo yari yiteze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, nawe, ntabwo afite ubwenge.
The child was.	Umwana yari.
I am so happy to have so many friends	Nishimiye cyane kubona inshuti nyinshi
Applying was good.	Gusaba byari byiza.
I just wanted to be close to you	Nashakaga gusa kuba hafi yawe
I am a boy.	Ndi umuhungu.
I see myself doing the same thing	Njye mbona nkora ikintu kimwe
Tell your friend.	Bwira inshuti yawe.
Everyone should read this.	Umuntu wese agomba gusoma ibi.
I should go back to where he was.	Nkwiye gusubira aho ari.
There are so many good things here	Hano hari ibintu byinshi byiza
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
He used to talk.	Yakundaga kuvuga.
But it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
There are many reasons.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
I have the same problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe
I don't have to.	Nta muntu n'umwe ngomba.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo sibyo.
I'm not happy.	Ntabwo nishimiye.
I didn't get the time.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya.
I want to know if that is the case	Ndashaka kumenya niba aribyo
I like to make new friends	Nkunda gushaka inshuti nshya
I think you feel the same way	Ntekereza ko nawe yumva ibintu kimwe

I know this is only a week away	Nzi ko iki aricyo cyumweru gusa
I had a lot of money	Nari mfite amafaranga menshi
We need to know why.	Tugomba kumenya impamvu.
So much, so much.	Byinshi, cyane.
I want to do it here.	Ndashaka kubikora hano.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga gutya.
All he does is make money.	Ibyo akora byose ni amafaranga.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
If he has a family.	Niba afite umuryango.
This is definitely not a problem where you have to.	Ibi rwose ntabwo ari ikibazo aho ugomba.
I'm beautiful and you can.	Ndi mwiza nawe urashobora.
It's been a long, long time coming.	Yagiye igihe kirekire, kirekire.
I want to know why.	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu.
Faith is a problem.	Kwizera ni ikibazo.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
That’s when I thought of myself	Icyo gihe natekereje kuri njye
I needed to go back.	Nari nkeneye gusubira inyuma.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza.
Everything he had to do.	Ibyo yagombaga gukora byose.
He did what he was supposed to do.	Yakoze ibyo yagombaga gukora.
I just wanted a little time to think	Nashakaga gusa umwanya muto wo gutekereza
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
He could see it here.	Yashoboraga kureba hano.
I thought you were him	Natekerezaga ko uri we
He was not here.	Ntiyari hano.
I can get help now	Nshobora kubona ubufasha ubu
He was good at that.	Yari mwiza kuri ibyo.
He could see that it was.	Yashoboraga kubona ko aribyo.
I wanted to win	Nashakaga gutsinda
I'm not much.	Ntabwo ndi byinshi.
I told no one	Nta muntu nabwiye
Down to the last thing.	Hasi kuri buri kintu cya nyuma.
I want to go back to that	Ndashaka gusubira kuri ibyo
In the end, it was not.	Amaherezo, ntabwo yari arimo.
I don't want money	Ntabwo nshaka amafaranga
I wanted to do it	Nashakaga kubikora
That's exactly what happened.	Nibyo rwose mubyukuri.
What a great.	Niki kinini.
Maybe, this time.	Ahari, iki gihe.
You have to really trust that person.	Ugomba kwizera rwose uwo muntu.
You knew he wanted to go.	Wari uziko ashaka kugenda.
I felt scared inside me	Numvise mfite ubwoba muri njye
I think that was absolutely true	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari ukuri rwose
I don't think that's what you want.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aricyo ushaka.
I need to do it.	Nkeneye kubikora.
I didn't think so.	Ntacyo natekerezaga.
I think it will be good	Ntekereza ko bizaba byiza
But we have to do it.	Ariko tugomba kubikora.
I wanted to be near you	Nashakaga kuba hafi yawe

You can't say who he is.	Ntushobora kuvuga uwo ari we.
I knew what that meant	Nari nzi icyo byari kuvuga
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But you have to tell me.	Ariko ugomba kumbwira.
It’s really good my time.	Nibyiza rwose umwanya wanjye.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko yabikoze.
There is one thing he cannot do.	Hariho ikintu kimwe adashobora gukora.
Too much walking.	Kugenda cyane.
It was not very difficult.	Ntabwo byari bigoye cyane.
In fact, he may be my favorite.	Mubyukuri, ashobora kuba nkunda.
No one	Nta muntu n'umwe
I didn't know where he was	Sinari nzi aho ari
It is not a good plan.	Ntabwo ari gahunda nziza.
I can't tomorrow	Sinshobora ejo
I am so happy to be with her	Nishimiye cyane kuba hamwe na we
I did nothing	Ntacyo nigeze nkora
I need to be there for my daughter	Nkeneye kuba ahari umukobwa wanjye
I can't carry your money	Sinshobora gutwara amafaranga yawe
I had the same problem.	Nagize ikibazo kimwe.
I wanted to believe.	Nashakaga kwizera.
We have things to do, good things to do.	Dufite ibintu byo gukora, ibintu byiza.
I was the closest thing they had	Nari ikintu cya hafi bari bafite
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kugenda gusa.
I never see enough.	Ntabwo mbona na rimwe bihagije.
But I don’t have to.	Ariko ntagomba.
Getting more.	Kubona byinshi.
But it is absolutely true.	Ariko ni ukuri rwose.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
A little walk	Kugenda gato
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
I have to watch	Ngomba kureba
I wanted him to go.	Nashakaga ko agenda.
I can help people see things	Nshobora gufasha abantu kubona ibintu
I'm here and I'm not going	Ndi hano kandi ntabwo ngiye
We can never go.	Nta na rimwe dushobora kugenda.
I didn’t want to go back	Sinifuzaga gusubira imbere
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
And she is, not a woman.	Kandi ni we, ntabwo ari umugore.
I don't want a job.	Sinshaka akazi.
I wanted time alone.	Nashakaga umwanya wenyine.
I am not at home yet	Kugeza ubu ntabwo ndi murugo
He never looked.	Ntiyigeze asa.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
Nothing would happen to it.	Ntacyo byari kuba kuri yo.
I am not his youngest daughter.	Ntabwo ndi umukobwa we muto.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
I need to think about this	Nkeneye gutekereza kuri ibi
I need to go, live with her	Nkeneye kugenda, kubana na we
He wanted to know why.	Yashakaga kumenya impamvu.
I can be lucky	Nshobora kugira amahirwe
He was very good at that.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri ibyo.
You can't trust anyone.	Ntushobora kwizera umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I really have to go.	Ngomba rwose kugenda.
I know you have a family	Nzi ko ufite umuryango
And that's a good thing.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
Had a great day.	Yagize umunsi mwiza.
I am not the right person.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu ukwiye.
I knew he was scared	Nari nzi ko afite ubwoba
Learn more every day.	Kwiga byinshi buri munsi.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko.
He could see everything from here.	Yashoboraga kubona ibintu byose kuva hano.
I can’t just walk away	Sinshobora kugenda gusa
He should have seen.	Yari akwiye kubona.
I like to live with her like that	Nkunda kubana na we gutya
He is the only person.	Ni umuntu wenyine.
I think that's really good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza rwose.
I had heard nothing	Ntacyo nari numvise
It was really quick to do that.	Nukuri rwose byari vuba cyane kubikora.
I thought	Natekereje
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
I need to do something today.	Nkeneye kugira icyo nkora uyu munsi.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
I love cars	Nkunda imodoka cyane
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I am here with you	Ndi hano hamwe nawe
It was just that.	Byari gusa.
I was not sure what	Sinari nzi neza icyo
I saw nothing wrong	Ntacyo nabonye kibi
I can do all this	Nshobora gukora ibi byose
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi icyo aricyo.
I'm looking for something you found	Ndashaka ikintu wabonye
Everyone wants to go.	Umuntu wese arashaka kugenda.
He just chose to live.	Yahisemo kubaho gusa.
Had he not done so, it would not have happened.	Niba atabikoze, ntabwo byari kugenda.
I really should have helped the baby	Nari nkwiye rwose gufasha umwana
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.
I was looking for something	Nashakaga ikintu
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
He never spoke.	Ntiyigeze avuga.
I need to do this	Nkeneye gukora ibi
All you have to do is believe.	Ukeneye kwizera gusa.
I had a friend in him	Nari mfite inshuti muri we
It has not always been easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byari byoroshye.
A lot of things for me	Ibintu byinshi kuri njye
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
I guess, to do that	Ndakeka yuko, kubikora
He never thought.	Ntiyigeze atekereza.
I didn't know what to say	Sinari nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
I thought he did something really good	Natekereje ko yakoze ibintu byiza rwose
Or he did, once.	Cyangwa yakoze, rimwe.
When he was three years old.	Igihe yari afite imyaka itatu.
I didn't feel well	Ntabwo numvise neza
It is so beautiful and close.	Ni mwiza cyane kandi hafi.
I didn't know what to think.	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza.
Wherever he wanted to go he could not come with him.	Aho yashakaga kujya ntashobora kuza hamwe na we.
I thought maybe he knew something	Natekereje ko ahari hari icyo azi
We are lucky.	Dufite amahirwe.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
There is a family here.	Hano hari umuryango.
I knew it was true	Nari nzi ko ari ukuri
Women.	Akazi.
he asked.	yabajije.
Something.	Ikintu.
We need more and more.	Dukeneye byinshi kandi byinshi.
I knew that would happen.	Nari nzi ko ibyo byari kubaho.
The child is a girl.	Umwana ni umukobwa.
He has a house.	Afite inzu.
Everyone has no job.	Umuntu wese nta kazi afite.
I knew he had the truth.	Nari nzi ko afite ukuri.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.	Sinshaka gusubira hanze ejo.
I like to feel inside of me	Nkunda kumva uri imbere muri njye
That's right.	Nibyo.
From the ground up.	Kuva hasi.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
This is what we need.	Ibi nibyo dukeneye.
She is my youngest child.	Ni umwana wanjye muto.
And wait a long time	Kandi gutegereza igihe kirekire
I would have won nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe nari gutsinda.
I want to stay here	Ndashaka kuguma hano
I have never seen anyone	Ntabwo nigeze mbona umuntu
I'm really bad	Mfite rwose nabi
I mean, he was right	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yari afite ukuri
He would not go.	Ntiyari kugenda.
But he must have.	Ariko agomba kugira.
You can't tell what it is.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo aricyo.
I think there is something about this.	Ntekereza ko hari ikintu kuri ibi.
I really need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe mubyukuri
At that time there was one woman	Icyo gihe hari umugore umwe
This was a girl.	Uyu yari umukobwa.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
And there is a good reason.	Kandi hariho impamvu nziza.
He was not going to leave.	Ntabwo yari agiye kugenda.
I didn't need anyone	Ntabwo nari nkeneye umuntu
Just not right.	Gusa sibyo.
I knew what he wanted.	Nari nzi icyo ashaka.
I can never take it	Sinshobora na rimwe gufata
I'm not sure where it's from.	Sinzi neza aho iri kure.
Not that there is a lot of time to eat.	Ntabwo ari uko hari igihe kinini cyo kurya.
I knew he would do it	Nari nzi ko azabikora
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
You can talk to yourself.	Urashobora kuvugana nawe wenyine.
I really mean getting to know someone	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose kumenya umuntu
That's right.	Nibyo.
I really am in this world.	Nukuri ndi muri iyi si.
I wanted time to think	Nashakaga umwanya wo gutekereza
I can't take this	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ibi
I was scared and scared	Nari mfite ubwoba kandi mfite ubwoba
I'm glad to be here	Nishimiye kuguma hano
You too.	Nawe.
This time is short.	Iki gihe ni gito.
I can always get a gift	Nshobora buri gihe kubona impano
I heard him swimming	Numvise arimo koga
Good friends	Inshuti nziza.
This is a boy.	Uyu ni umuhungu.
I don't need that.	Ntabwo nkeneye ibyo.
He was alone.	Na we yari wenyine.
I never felt the need to speak up	Sinigeze mbona ko nkeneye kuvuga
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.
I mean, we were new friends	Ndashaka kuvuga, twari inshuti nshya
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kugenda.
And she was a very beautiful girl.	Kandi yari umukobwa mwiza cyane.
It would be difficult to find another.	Byaba bigoye kubona ikindi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Not that it was too early.	Ntabwo ari uko byari kare.
But he had none.	Ariko ntabwo yari afite.
You want it !! 	Urashaka !!
??.	??.
But things went well.	Ariko ibintu byagenze neza.
He had to give up everything.	Yagombaga kureka byose.
I was going in the morning	Nari ngiye mu gitondo
I need to go to work	Nkeneye kujya ku kazi
There is nothing wrong with that	Nta kintu na kimwe ari amakosa ye
I didn’t want to go see things.	Sinifuzaga kujya kureba ibintu.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Just one idea.	Igitekerezo kimwe gusa.
That's what he learned from that.	Ibyo yamenye kubyo aribyo.
I was not close to him.	Ntabwo nari hafi ye.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
But she is a woman.	Ariko ni umugore.
I know my mistakes	Nzi amakosa yanjye
This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
She loved to read.	Yakundaga gusoma cyane.
He is here.	Ari hano.
But he is the only one.	Ariko ni we wenyine.
There is one more thing.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
Things are more or less the same.	Ibintu ni byinshi cyangwa ikindi.
There is no going back now.	Nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
I was just thinking	Natekerezaga gusa
I like to read.	Nkunda gusoma.
Sometimes I think, very good and lucky	Rimwe na rimwe ndatekereza, byiza cyane kandi amahirwe
Tonight he was scared.	Iri joro yari afite ubwoba.
But we are right.	Ariko twe ukuri.
I know nothing.	Ntacyo nzi.
I hope you can do it	Ndizera ko ushobora kubikora
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I was not an expert	Ntabwo nari umuhanga
And I can't help it.	Kandi ntashobora gufasha.
I didn't think so	Ntabwo natekerezaga na gato
You can't do anything better.	Ntushobora gukora ikindi cyiza.
I didn’t know he had a dog	Sinari nzi ko afite imbwa
Someone inside, very close.	Umuntu imbere, hafi cyane.
I have a family here	Mfite umuryango hano
That's right.	Nibyo.
I did something good	Nakoze ikintu cyiza
Who he was, what he did.	Uwo yari uwo, ibyo yakoze.
Maybe something else.	Ahari ikindi kintu.
And here he is.	Kandi hano ari umuntu.
I don't know what I like.	Sinzi ibyo nkunda.
I was so happy all that time.	Nishimiye cyane icyo gihe cyose.
He says he didn't.	Avuga ko atabikoze.
Definitely a girl.	Rwose umukobwa.
I can't think	Sinshobora gutekereza
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
It's true.	Ni Kuri.
He needed to be here.	Yari akeneye kuba hano.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
The only problem was, it wasn't true.	Ikibazo gusa, ntabwo byari ukuri.
I can't trust anyone	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera umuntu
It's not just about being a good person.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo cyo kuba umuntu mwiza gusa.
I want to know what happened	Ndashaka kumenya uko byagenze
I guess that's why	Ndakeka ko ari yo mpamvu
They were my family.	Bari umuryango wanjye.
I wanted to know how he felt about things	Nashakaga kumenya uko yumva ibintu
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
He looked very good, in fact.	Yarebye neza cyane, mubyukuri.
If you really don't want to.	Niba mubyukuri udashaka.
The girl is possible.	Umukobwa birashoboka.
I've been to you once	Nigeze kuba wowe rimwe
I want to overcome this	Ndashaka gutsinda ibi
People are afraid to speak.	Abantu bafite ubwoba bwo kuvuga.
I never saw that	Sinigeze mbona ibyo
It was not food.	Ntabwo byari ibyo kurya.
Maybe we should move on, after all.	Ahari tugomba kujya imbere, nyuma ya byose.
I know this is a bad time	Nzi ko iki ari igihe kibi
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane ko atari byo.
I can't get out of this	Sinshobora kuva kuri ibi
But that was exactly what he needed.	Ariko ibyo nibyo yari akeneye.
I think it's good	Ntekereza ko ari mwiza
I knew what I was looking for	Nari nzi icyo nashakaga
I can't wait to drive	Sinshobora gutegereza gutwara imodoka
I never thought of this	Sinigeze ntekereza ibi
I think you may be right	Ndatekereza ko ushobora kuba ufite ukuri
Everyone has the opportunity to learn, the same.	Umuntu wese afite amahirwe yo kwiga, kimwe.
He could be anyone.	Yashoboraga kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He was well aware that no one was inside.	Yari azi neza ko nta muntu uri imbere.
Very simple but easy.	Byoroshye cyane ariko byoroshye.
Lots of cars.	Imodoka nyinshi.
I know you can understand.	Nzi ko ushobora kumva.
He seemed scared.	Yasaga naho afite ubwoba.
We are worried.	Dufite impungenge.
I like to be a woman	Nkunda kuba umugore
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko aribyo.
I can't believe you did it	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera ko wabikoze
Friends now.	Inshuti ubu.
I can't figure out why.	Sinshobora kumenya impamvu.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu.
He had already heard something.	Yari amaze kumva ikintu.
Lots of kids, lots of people.	Abana benshi, abantu benshi.
I was about to leave	Nari ngiye kugenda
I feel like you're leaving tomorrow.	Ndumva ugiye ejo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
And that's really cool.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza rwose.
I don’t think that’s the best thing for me.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo byiza kuri njye.
I thought you could help.	Natekereje ko ushobora gufasha.
I need to know more about him	Nkeneye kumenya byinshi kuri we
He is a child.	Ni umwana.
I really enjoy the job	Nishimiye cyane akazi
Probably thirty years old.	Ahari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
What they had.	Ibyo bari bafite.
Very easy.	Byoroshye cyane.
Only us.	Ni twe gusa.
I didn’t know where, but he was nearby	Sinari nzi aho, ariko yari hafi
I know you know something	Nzi ko hari icyo uzi
More on this.	Byinshi kuri ibi.
I have to live with him	Ngomba kubana na we
To have someone.	Kugira umuntu.
I thought so	Natekereje ko aribyo
That's exactly what happened.	Nibyo rwose mubyukuri.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
I thought he would be here	Natekereje ko azaba hano
It was just that sometimes it was too much.	Byari gusa ko rimwe na rimwe byari byinshi cyane.
I think we need it more than ever	Ndakeka ko dukeneye kuruta ikindi gihe cyose
I was not a young man	Ntabwo nari umusore
They all had enough.	Bose bari bafite bihagije.
You probably had the truth.	Birashoboka ko wari ufite ukuri.
Or he tried.	Cyangwa yagerageje.
I want to eat something	Ndashaka kurya ikintu
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
I hope everyone has the gift to do something	Nizera ko abantu bose bafite impano yo gukora ikintu
The food is good, too.	Ibiryo ni byiza, kandi.
It's good to know where to go.	Nibyiza kumenya aho ugomba kujya.
It would not be difficult.	Ntabwo byari kuba bigoye.
He should not have.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kugira.
I feel it will happen	Ndumva bizaba
He had not seen the coming.	Ntabwo yari yabonye ibyo kuza.
I want to know what happened	Ndashaka kumenya uko byagenze
I had no reason to stay	Nta mpamvu nari mfite yo kuguma
One has to do it.	Umuntu agomba kubikora.
And one more thing.	Kandi ikindi kimwe.
However, on this we must reconsider.	Ariko, kuri ibi tugomba kongera gutekereza.
There are children.	Hariho abana.
We have to get out of here soon.	Tugomba kuva hano vuba.
I want more than anything else	Ndashaka kuruta ikindi kintu cyose
He knows it's a dog.	Azi ko ari imbwa.
I can't say the same	Sinshobora kuvuga kimwe
I can't say who.	Sinshobora kuvuga uwo.
I needed to see	Nari nkeneye kubona
You have no faith. ''	Nta kwizera ntacyo ufite ''.
And here it was.	Kandi hano byari.
But he was right.	Ariko yari afite ukuri.
I can't do that	Sinshobora kubikora
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
I should learn to swim	Nkwiye kwiga koga
It's been a long time coming here.	Igihe kirekire cyane hano.
Apparently it was a problem.	Biragaragara ko byari ikibazo.
I know it's not your fault	Nzi ko atari amakosa yawe
I did.	Nakoze.
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
I guess he really wanted a lot of party	Ndakeka ko yashakaga rwose ibirori byinshi
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Everyone who works there.	Umuntu wese ukora aho.
I highly doubt it.	Ndashidikanya cyane.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He must be her.	Agomba kuba ari we.
I'm worried about me	Mfite impungenge kuri njye
I think it was good.	Ntekereza ko byari byiza.
I mean, nothing.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntacyo.
I had so many.	Nari mfite benshi cyane.
None of what you said is true.	Nta na kimwe mu byo wavuze ari ukuri.
He may have been right.	Ashobora kuba yari afite ukuri.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I don't believe this is true.	Ntabwo nizera ko ibi ari ukuri.
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
In fact, you may be the only one.	Mubyukuri, ushobora kuba umwe wenyine.
It's something you do.	Ni ikintu ukora.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I had a problem hearing today	Nari mfite ikibazo cyo kumva uyu munsi
I can't do it	Ntabwo nshobora gukora
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
I should have been working near me	Nari nkwiye kuba nkora hafi yanjye
There is only chance.	Hariho amahirwe gusa.
Everything you said is true.	Ibyo wavuze byose ni ukuri.
He just has things.	Afite ibintu gusa.
I should have been here	Nari nkwiye kuba hano
He didn't do it either.	Ntabwo na we yabikoze.
There was only one thing he needed to know.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa yari akeneye kumenya.
He did not know how to work for a long time.	Ntabwo yari azi gukora igihe kirekire.
He may have said something.	Ashobora kuba hari icyo yavuze.
The woman was beautiful to him	Umugore wari mwiza kuri we
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
He is one person.	Ni umuntu umwe.
I didn’t want to do any of that	Sinifuzaga gukora kimwe muri byo
You can't tell what he can say.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo ashobora kuvuga.
He could work.	Yashoboraga gukora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
And, that’s good for me.	Kandi, nibyiza kuri njye.
And they really aren't human.	Kandi rwose ntabwo ari abantu.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
Maybe only one person.	Ahari umuntu umwe gusa.
Yesterday, he thought.	Ejo, yatekereje.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
I feel good.	Ndumva ari byiza.
Girl.	Umukobwa.
He is a boy.	Ni umuhungu.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I think he can do whatever he wants	Ntekereza ko ashobora gukora icyo ashaka
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
I wonder where he went	Ndabaza aho yagiye
I can't stop thinking	Sinshobora guhagarika gutekereza
Maybe I should have been.	Birashoboka ko nari nkwiye kuba.
No waiting.	Nta gutegereza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
I wonder why they are here	Ndabaza impamvu bari hano
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
That's not the way it looks.	Ntabwo ari uko asa.
I think he will be this week.	Ndatekereza ko azaba muri iki cyumweru.
I shouldn't talk to you	Ntabwo nkwiye kuvugana nawe
I did it alone	Nakoze wenyine
You may have the opportunity.	Urashobora kugira amahirwe ahari.
I just wanted it from afar.	Nashakaga gusa kuva kure.
They had someone they had.	Bafite uwo bari bafite.
I didn't get the chance	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe
Come on.	Hasi.
That's a big deal.	Icyo ni ikintu kinini.
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kugenda
I have nothing to say	Ntacyo nshaka kuvuga
It’s not even a lot of thinking.	Ntabwo ari no gutekereza cyane.
I can't do everything.	Sinshobora gukora byose.
I want to be something	Ndashaka kuba ikintu
If it was a book.	Niba yari igitabo.
I have a job for him tomorrow	Mfite akazi kuri we ejo
Going together.	Kujya hamwe.
Why? 	Kuki?
he thought.	yatekereje.
But the boy was very bad.	Ariko umuhungu yari mubi cyane.
He is sitting here.	Yicaye hano.
You can see what you think.	Urashobora kubona icyo utekereza.
But it is me.	Ariko ni njye.
I really don't think so	Ndizera rwose ko atari byo
I think of him every day	Ntekereza kuri we buri munsi
But he is.	Ariko uwo ni we.
I think that's what you said	Ntekereza ko aribyo wavuze
I was far away.	Nari kure.
That's not the case with your plan.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri gahunda yawe.
I have to do something else	Nkwiye gukora ikindi
Not now, not tomorrow.	Ntabwo ari ubu, si ejo.
It started.	Yatangiye.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Please, you must.	Nyamuneka, ugomba.
I know he will be here	Nzi ko azaba hano
I needed to buy time	Nari nkeneye kugura umwanya
That no phone was good.	Ko nta terefone yari nziza.
Outside.	Hanze.
He knew everything.	Yari azi byose.
I know you're bad	Nzi ko uri mubi
I think she is a very beautiful woman	Ntekereza ko ari umugore mwiza cyane
That's a lot of kids.	Ibyo ni abana benshi.
He did all that.	Yakoze ibyo byose.
I'm not sure what happened.	Ntabwo nzi neza uko byagenze.
I can work on one of those	Nshobora gukora kuri kimwe muri ibyo
I guess you can do wrong	Ndakeka yuko ushobora gukora nabi
I don’t know how it happened, to this day	Sinzi uko byagenze, kugeza uyu munsi
To see	Kubona.
And not only that.	Kandi si ibyo gusa.
I don't know where he is	Sinzi aho ari
It's really good.	Mubyukuri ni byiza.
I think it worked	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza
Kinini.	Kinini.
I was sure there was more	Nari nzi neza ko hari byinshi
Everything was fine and easy.	Ibintu byose byari byiza kandi byoroshye.
We can't do it.	Ntidushobora gukora.
But no phone.	Ariko nta na terefone.
I don't want problems here	Sinshaka ibibazo hano
I know it's hard.	Nzi ko bigoye.
I shouldn’t have taken the baby	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gufata umwana
Nothing is too small	Nta kintu na kimwe ari gito cyane
I can't even imagine doing it.	Sinshobora no gutekereza kubikora.
You're lucky, really.	Ufite amahirwe, mubyukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But all was well.	Ariko byose byari byiza kuruta.
But.	Ariko.
Being here first.	Kuba hano mbere.
I was about to win	Nari hafi gutsinda
I can't believe that anyone can say anything they don't want to.	Ntashobora kwizera ko umuntu uwo ari we wese ashobora kuvuga ikintu cyose adashaka.
Something he knew existed.	Ikintu yari azi kubaho.
Why or why not.	Impamvu cyangwa ntabwo.
I have a mistake.	Mfite amakosa.
He thought it was possible, but he did not expect it to be.	Yatekereje ko bishoboka, ariko ntabwo yari yizeye ko azabikora.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
He did.	Yakoze.
I hope you can do it	Ndizera ko ushobora kubikora
She just wanted to be with him.	Yashakaga gusa kubana na we.
This is normal.	Ubu ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I have a way.	Mfite uburyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I think that's a good idea.	Ntekereza ko icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I believe you should.	Ndizera ko ugomba.
He had to come.	Yagombaga kuza.
It will be.	Bizaba.
He can speak.	Arashobora kuvuga.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari ukuri.
I can live with them all	Nshobora kubana na bose
His father was right about the same thing.	Se yari afite ukuri ku kintu kimwe.
He really has to work.	Agomba rwose gukora.
But he.	Ariko we.
No one is around.	Nta muntu uri hafi.
I wanted to stay in the house	Nashakaga kuguma mu nzu
I think it would be nice	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza
He hadn't been here for a while.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe gito hano.
And we all have friends.	Kandi twese dufite inshuti.
At the same time.	Muri icyo gihe kimwe.
In fact this is possible.	Mubyukuri ibi birashoboka.
A short time.	Igihe gito.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko byari byiza
That's right.	Ibyo aribyo.
I am not taking the opportunity	Ntabwo ndimo gufata amahirwe
I didn’t know almost everything about him, in fact.	Ntabwo nari nzi hafi ya byose kuri we, mubyukuri.
I can help with that.	Nshobora gufasha muri ibyo.
I didn't know you were a player	Sinari nzi ko nawe uri umukinnyi
I highly doubt it.	Ndashidikanya cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I can't do that	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora
I guess he didn't hear anything	Ndakeka ko ntacyo yumvise
Maybe early this morning.	Ahari vuba muri iki gitondo.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
I was not sure where	Ntabwo nari nzi neza aho
I can walk here	Nshobora kugenda hano
Many things to learn.	Ibintu byinshi byo kwiga.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
Not now, never.	Ntabwo ari ubu, nta na rimwe.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
I can't wait to see what he thinks	Sinshobora gutegereza kureba icyo atekereza
I saw it now	Nabonye kuri ubu
It's not like he's not here.	Ntabwo ari nkaho atari hano.
I did not see his whereabouts that day	Uwo munsi sinigeze mbona aho ari
Of these, however, later.	Muri ibyo ariko, nyuma.
And he was not working.	Kandi ntabwo yari akora.
Someone was outside.	Umuntu yari hanze.
I shouldn't be here.	Ntabwo nkwiye kuba hano.
I can do well here	Nshobora gukora neza hano
But there is one thing.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe.
Sometimes he is.	Rimwe na rimwe ni we.
Each one is good.	Buri kimwe ni cyiza.
I guess so.	Ndakeka ko aribyo.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I didn't know what to think	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza
I just know all the problems he had	Gusa nzi ibibazo byose yari afite
But that is not all.	Ariko sibyo rwose.
They have money.	Bafite amafaranga.
It’s not really a big deal.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikintu kinini.
We have a family.	Dufite umuryango.
Waiting is good	Gutegereza ni byiza
I wonder if he saw anything	Ndabaza niba hari icyo yabonye
Very good time, but very short time	Umwanya mwiza cyane, ariko umwanya muto cyane
I want to be here friends	Ndashaka kuba hano inshuti
please.	nyamuneka.
It would not be easy.	Ntabwo byaba ari ibintu byoroshye.
But that is a long way off.	Ariko ibyo ni kure cyane.
I am first and foremost your friend	Ndi mbere na mbere inshuti yawe
Why is there something we need to learn.	Kuki hari ikintu tugomba kwiga.
I knew he was scared	Nari nzi ko afite ubwoba
I think it's my age	Ntekereza ko ari imyaka yanjye
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
He can't stay away.	Ntashobora kuguma kure.
Most of the time in fact	Igihe kinini mubyukuri
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
I knew we could do it	Nari nzi ko dushobora kubikora
There is something else to do.	Hariho ikindi kintu cyo gukora.
Probably me.	Birashoboka njye.
I think he is right	Ntekereza ko avuga ukuri
I wanted to go home	Nashakaga gutaha
I needed to go	Nari nkeneye kugenda
I need to get to know my son again	Nkeneye kongera kumenya umuhungu wanjye
Now I know what to do	Ubu nzi icyo gukora
We were on time.	Twari ku gihe.
Not so, but soon.	Ntabwo aribyo, ariko vuba.
I wanted to know	Nashakaga kumenya
I have what you want	Mfite icyo ushaka
You can go home.	Urashobora gutaha.
I know why he did it.	Nzi impamvu yabikoze.
It's good to be together.	Nibyiza kubana.
None of us have a say.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ufite icyo avuga.
I guess it should have been	Ndakeka ko yagombaga kuba
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
I never saw that.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo.
I was definitely going to buy that	Nari ngiye rwose kugura ibyo
And one more thing.	Kandi ikindi kintu kimwe.
They know the plan.	Bazi gahunda.
I have enough to do.	Mfite ibintu bihagije byo gukora.
I saw everything and heard it	Nabonye byose numva
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
I'm going to leave soon	Ngiye kugenda vuba
I needed to know where he was	Nari nkeneye kumenya aho ari
That said, you can only do what you can.	Yavuze, ushobora gukora gusa ibyo ushobora gukora.
I can learn a lot, work hard	Nshobora kwiga byinshi, gukora cyane
I'm sure he did.	Nzi neza ko yabikoze.
That's not what he expected.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yiteze.
I did a lot too	Nanjye nakoze cyane
Here are some things you can think of.	Hano hari ibintu ushobora gutekereza.
He did not expect this.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ibi.
You can schedule a shutdown.	Urashobora kugira gahunda yo guhagarika gahunda.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
And you have.	Kandi ufite.
You really do know something.	Nukuri hari icyo uzi.
In front of me.	Imbere yanjye.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
But he was.	Ariko yari.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Good tonight.	Nibyiza kuri iri joro.
I am so happy to be with you	Nishimiye cyane kubana nawe
Lots of catch.	Byinshi byo gufata.
Not good for him.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri we.
The one they have is the worst.	Uwo bafite ni mubi cyane.
That was great to do.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane gukora.
I can talk to you, but I can't talk back	Nshobora kuvugana nawe, ariko ntashobora kuvuga inyuma
Please, my hair is beautiful.	Nyamuneka, umusatsi wanjye ni mwiza.
I just want to make sure that it is	Gusa ndashaka kumenya neza ko aribyo
I didn’t need to think or say or act	Sinari nkeneye gutekereza cyangwa kuvuga cyangwa gukora
If you want to know more about the movie.	Niba ushaka kumenya byinshi kuri firime.
He was not ready.	Ntiyari yiteguye.
He used to have his own time.	Yakundaga kugira umwanya wenyine.
I should definitely stop trying	Nkwiye guhagarika kugerageza rwose
He was not a friend.	Ntiyari inshuti.
Bad thing, very bad	Ikintu kibi, kibi cyane
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
He tried to speak.	Yagerageje kuvuga.
I shouldn't have said it was your fault	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuvuga ko ari amakosa yawe
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I knew exactly where we were	Nari nzi neza aho turi
He could have stayed.	Yashoboraga kuguma.
I don't know what to do	Sinzi icyo gukora
I don't want to know anything	Sinshaka kumenya ikintu
I don't know.	Sinzi.
He had help, that's right.	Yari afite ubufasha, ibyo ni ukuri.
I want to be with him	Ndashaka kubana na we
I can be your friend	Nshobora kuba inshuti yawe
I just see it as an opportunity.	Gusa mbona ari amahirwe.
I never felt like eating anything	Sinigeze numva nshaka kurya ikintu na kimwe
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
He is leaving.	Ari kugenda.
I never heard much about him.	Sinigeze numva byinshi kuri we.
I can't think of anyone	Sinshobora gutekereza uwo ari we
I wonder if you have that	Ndabaza niba ufite ibyo
When he.	Iyo we.
I think that's hard.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bigoye.
I'm glad we can	Nishimiye ko dushobora gukora
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
I have to go well there	Ngomba kugenda neza aho
I can't worry	Sinshobora kugira impungenge
I can always be a good player	Nshobora buri gihe kuba umukinnyi mwiza
However, it is not easy.	Ariko, ntabwo byoroshye.
Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.
This was too much for him.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane kuri we.
I guess.	Ndakeka.
I didn’t think she was really good	Sinatekerezaga ko yari mwiza rwose
I hope he thinks it's me	Nizera ko atekereza ko ari njye
I mean, that's right	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri nibyo
I knew better than that	Nari nzi neza kuruta ibyo
I don't know where he is	Sinzi aho ari
He just did it.	Yabikoze gusa.
I like that it is easy and good.	Nkunda ko byoroshye kandi byiza.
I enjoyed the program.	Nari nishimiye gahunda.
And very good.	Kandi byiza cyane.
He was not sure where he was.	Ntiyari azi neza aho ari.
Or he thinks he did.	Cyangwa yibwira ko yabikoze.
It's really beautiful and it's beautiful.	Ni mwiza rwose kandi ni mwiza.
A lot of things are good.	Ibintu byinshi ni byiza.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
Maybe another time.	Ahari ikindi gihe.
He came here.	Yaje hano.
Be everything we need.	Yaba ibyo dukeneye byose.
Something he must have bought.	Ikintu agomba kuba amaze kugura.
As you were.	Nkuko wari uri.
I have a way of doing it	Mfite uburyo bwo kubikora
He used to say that it was.	Yakundaga kuvuga ko aribyo.
She is very embarrassed.	Afite isoni cyane.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
This is probably not what you want.	Ibi birashoboka ko atari byo ushaka.
He tried to think.	Yagerageje gutekereza.
And wait.	Kandi gutegereza.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
You can try again soon.	Urashobora kongera kugerageza vuba.
Only children.	Abana gusa.
It just wasn’t.	Gusa ntabwo yari.
I think he has problems	Ndakeka ko afite ibibazo
He was not there.	Ntiyari aho ari.
We needed help.	Twari dukeneye ubufasha.
I think a lot of it is good to say.	Ntekereza ko byinshi ari byiza kuvuga.
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
You know absolutely nothing.	Ntacyo uzi rwose.
I can't stay here for long	Sinshobora kuba hano igihe kirekire
That's good, too	Nibyiza, kandi
I think he got the idea	Ntekereza ko yabonye igitekerezo
The problem is real.	Ikibazo nukuri.
Not much for that, really.	Nta byinshi kuri byo, mubyukuri.
You don't have to be the same.	Ntugomba kugira kimwe.
I'm not happy.	Ntabwo nishimiye.
She loved the baby.	Yakundaga umwana.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
I was well aware now.	Nari nzi neza ubu.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
It was a bad idea.	Byari igitekerezo kibi.
I can be a teacher	Nshobora kuba umwarimu
I have never seen this person	Sinigeze mbona uyu muntu
I have to go far.	Ngomba kujya kure.
I'm sure he has nothing to say	Nzi neza ko ntacyo ashaka kuvuga
Something really bad.	Ikintu rwose ni kibi.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
I really should have seen this.	Nari nkwiye rwose kubona ibi.
There is a young man here.	Hano hari umusore.
I didn’t think that was possible	Sinatekerezaga ko ibyo bishoboka
Looks good now.	Birasa neza ubu.
She likes to eat.	Akunda kurya.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Time, however, is short.	Igihe ariko, ni gito.
I thought to myself.	Natekereje muri njye.
I needed time alone	Nari nkeneye umwanya wenyine
It was all family.	Byose byari umuryango.
I like.	Nkunda .
I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo nkora nabi.
I should say.	Nkwiye kuvuga.
I want to go back to school	Ndashaka gusubira ku ishuri
I thought that was good and good	Natekereje ko ibyo ari byiza kandi byiza
I thought it was years	Natekereje ko ari imyaka
You know you can do it.	Uzi ko ushobora kubikora.
I didn't know much about him	Ntabwo nari nzi byinshi kuri we
I can't live like that	Sinshobora kubaho gutya
Everyone was just human.	Abantu bose bari abantu gusa.
I guess he meant it	Ndakeka ko ashaka kuvuga
But he was gone.	Ariko yari yagiye.
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
He can win.	Ashobora gutsinda.
I knew he had to tell me that	Nari nzi ko agomba kumbwira ibyo
You love money.	Ukunda amafaranga.
But he is a child.	Ariko ni umwana.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
He wants my family.	Arashaka umuryango wanjye.
But that is not all.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I was not sure who he was	Sinari nzi neza uwo ari we
I would know if there is	Nari kumenya niba ahari
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
This one looked good.	Iyi yasaga neza.
Today is not your day.	Uyu munsi ntabwo ari umunsi wawe.
He knows everything.	Azi byose.
I think they are children	Ntekereza ko ari abana
Most of all.	Byinshi muri byinshi.
It was just this.	Byari ibi gusa.
You too.	Nawe.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
Looks like it's possible.	Birasa nkaho bishoboka.
Much to think about.	Byinshi byo gutekereza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You know how to be alone.	Uzi kuba wenyine.
I thought about why we were here	Natekereje ku mpamvu twari hano
I thought a lot this morning	Natekereje cyane kuri iki gitondo
I don't know what to say	Ntabwo nzi icyo avuga
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
I want to be in this world.	Ndashaka kuri iyi si.
More for everyone.	Byinshi kuri bose.
I can't figure out what that is	Sinshobora kumenya neza icyo
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
He did not know who he was.	Ntabwo yari azi uwo ari we.
He did everything wrong.	Yakoze ibintu byose nabi.
He never thought of doing it.	Ntiyigeze atekereza kubikora.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
It's really good for me.	Ni mwiza rwose kuri njye.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
Everyone knows the truth.	Abantu bose bazi ukuri.
That was him.	Uwo yari we.
And sometimes it is possible.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu
I mean, there was a lot.	Ndashaka kuvuga, hari byinshi byari.
He wants to do it.	Ashaka kubikora.
Just one idea.	Igitekerezo kimwe gusa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Only then.	Icyo gihe gusa.
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
But he was gone.	Ariko yari yagiye.
You think so.	Utekereza ko aribyo.
I mean smart.	Ndashaka kuvuga ubwenge.
I need to talk to someone	Nkeneye kuvugana numuntu
I mean, it looks good	Ndashaka kuvuga, birasa neza
I appreciate your time.	Nishimiye umwanya wawe.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I need help here.	Nkeneye ubufasha hano.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
I just think of all this	Ndatekereza gusa kuri ibi byose
Very good stuff.	Ibintu byiza cyane.
I know exactly where we are now.	Nzi neza aho turi ubu.
I wanted to know where he was	Nashakaga kumenya aho ari
I did what he told me to do	Nakoze ibyo yambwiye gukora
I was not me.	Nari njye ntabwo ari njye.
And that's exactly what the child said here.	Kandi nibyo umwana yavuze hano.
I didn't have to come.	Sinari nkwiye kuza.
He also had.	Na we yari afite.
I want this outside	Ndashaka ibi hanze
Today, however, he needed time to think.	Uyu munsi ariko, yari akeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
I like to have a plan	Nkunda kugira gahunda
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko mubyukuri.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu
He knows where you are.	Azi aho uri.
I did things the way I wanted to	Nakoze ibintu uko nshaka
I did nothing wrong	Nta kibi nakoze
I believe there is always something to do	Nizera ko buri gihe hariho ikintu cyo gukora
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He's going to do it.	Agiye kubikora.
I was really good	Nari mwiza rwose
We really were.	Twari rwose.
Being a family.	Kuba umuryango.
He had a problem.	Yari afite ikibazo.
I should know better than I do now	Nkwiye kumenya neza kurenza ubu
I am a scared person.	Ndi umuntu ufite ubwoba.
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.
I'm going home.	Ngiye gutaha.
I think that's what he wants.	Ntekereza ko aricyo ashaka.
I know what you think.	Nzi icyo utekereza.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ikintu na kimwe
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I just needed a little time	Nari nkeneye gusa umwanya muto
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
I can't stay here.	Sinshobora kuguma hano.
I can learn to swim	Nshobora kwiga koga
I can go home	Nshobora gutaha
I wonder if it's close	Ndabaza niba ari hafi
I was scared	Nari mfite ubwoba
Sunday at home.	Ku cyumweru murugo.
It would be nice	Byari kuba byiza
Too far	Kure cyane
He has no.	Ntabwo afite.
He wanted to go back.	Yashakaga gusubira imbere.
Drinking especially.	Kunywa cyane cyane.
I wonder if this is too much for him	Ndabaza niba ibi ari byinshi kuri we
He didn't say anything to me.	Nta cyo yambwiye.
Probably, one day.	Birashoboka, umunsi umwe.
He did not want her to leave.	Ntiyashakaga ko agenda.
I needed him to do it on his own	Nari nkeneye ko abikora wenyine
I wanted what he wanted	Nashakaga icyo ashaka
I really wanted to help a child	Nashakaga rwose gufasha umwana
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kugenda
That's right.	Ibyo aribyo.
He was not going to comment.	Ntabwo yari agiye kugira icyo avuga.
I can't even think	Sinshobora no gutekereza
It's good to work.	Nibyiza gukora.
I think we have to stop everything	Ndatekereza ko tugomba guhagarika ibintu byose
He didn't say anything to me.	Nta cyo yambwiye.
I'm glad to be together.	Nishimiye kuba hamwe.
No, not today.	Ntabwo aribyo, uyu munsi.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
You don’t have to win.	Ntugomba gutsinda.
You have to stay where you are.	Ugomba kuguma aho uri.
I should have stayed	Nari nkwiye kuguma
I don’t know where they were, or if they were	Ntabwo nzi aho bari, cyangwa niba, bari
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
All he asked for was money.	Icyo yasabye ni amafaranga.
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
I think he is right.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri.
I had no problem with that.	Nta kibazo nagize kuri ibyo.
I knew at that time	Nari nzi ko icyo gihe
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
I wanted to do things right	Nashakaga gukora ibintu neza
I was.	Nari njye.
He is right about this.	Afite ukuri kuri iki kibazo.
I wanted it all to me	Nashakaga ko byose kuri njye
But that is not the time.	Ariko icyo gihe ntabwo aricyo gihe.
That is not the case at all, it is not the case.	Icyo ntabwo ari igihe na gito, ibyo ntacyo.
But we needed money.	Ariko twari dukeneye amafaranga.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari hafi imyaka yanjye.
Up and up.	Hejuru kandi hejuru.
That’s fine, and maybe one more thing.	Nibyiza, kandi birashoboka ikindi kintu kimwe.
I can't even be your friend now.	Ubu sinshobora no kuba inshuti yawe.
He had seen something.	Hari ikintu yari yabonye.
I can't believe you did it	Sinshobora kwizera ko wabikoze
You now have a friend.	Ubu ufite inshuti.
I mean, you're human	Ndashaka kuvuga ko uri umuntu
And it was.	Kandi byari byo.
I don't think he knew when he was talking.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko yari azi igihe yari amaze avuga.
He thought he looked good.	Yatekereje ko yasaga neza.
Once a week.	Rimwe mu cyumweru.
They are both children.	Bombi ni abana.
I hope it will be enough	Nizere ko bizaba bihagije
This is obviously not the case.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari byo.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
The little boy came to where I was	Umuhungu muto yaje aho ndi
It was too much.	Yari menshi cyane.
We have to be easy to find.	Tugomba kuba byoroshye kubona.
I have to get out of all that.	Ngomba kuva muri ibyo byose.
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
He was lucky.	Yari yagize amahirwe.
I can go home and get out of here	Nshobora gutaha no kuva hano
I don’t really feel the same.	Ntabwo rwose numva ari umwe.
It was just yesterday, after all.	Byari ejo gusa, nyuma ya byose.
Very nice day	Umunsi mwiza cyane.
He is happy to do so.	Yishimiye kubikora.
Everything was out.	Ibintu byose byari hanze.
Boy, can he.	Umuhungu, arashobora.
Not really the same thing.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikintu kimwe.
But he will do it.	Ariko azabikora.
I want to see what he can do	Ndashaka kureba icyo ashobora gukora
I always thought I was the only one	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko ari njye wenyine
At the time, I was embarrassed	Icyo gihe nari mfite isoni
I had a lot of problems	Nari mfite ibibazo byinshi
People were far away.	Abantu bari kure cyane.
I have to be the only one	Ngomba kuba ari njye wenyine
Probably not a good thing.	Birashoboka ko atari ikintu cyiza.
For him, far away.	Kuri we, kure.
You can do whatever you want.	Urashobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
But now there is a catch.	Ariko ubu hariho gufata.
He will never be able to walk.	Ntazigera ashobora kugenda.
I have an idea to talk about	Mfite igitekerezo cyo kuvuga
I think it will be good	Ndatekereza ko bizaba byiza
I never wanted anything else.	Sinigeze nshaka ikindi kintu.
I love what he does here	Nkunda ibyo akora hano
Time is short.	Igihe ni gito.
It's good to be human.	Nibyiza kuba umuntu.
I can't take it	Sinshobora gufata
So many good things.	Ibintu byinshi byiza.
Good thing to look forward to.	Ikintu cyiza cyo kureba imbere.
But a young man.	Ariko umusore muto.
I shouldn’t have gone with him	Sinari nkwiye kujyana na we
I was not.	Ntabwo nari.
I didn't know what he was talking about.	Sinari nzi ibyo avuga.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
He is now human.	Ubu ni umuntu.
It's not a movie or something.	Ntabwo ari firime cyangwa ikindi kintu.
I can't do this.	Sinshobora gukora ibi.
That was outside.	Ibyo byari hanze.
I don't know what it is	Sinzi icyo aricyo
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
This is not good, it is not.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza, ntabwo aribyo.
I have a plan to live	Mfite gahunda yo kubaho
Maybe they would do it again, or something else.	Birashoboka ko bari kongera kubikora, cyangwa ikindi kintu kibi.
How to speak.	Uburyo bwo kuvuga.
They have a job.	Bafite akazi.
I want to say how it happened.	Ndashaka kuvuga uko byagenze.
He never had any problems.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ibibazo na gato.
That's not right.	Ibyo sibyo.
I am happy for the opportunity	Nishimiye amahirwe
And in the end it worked.	Kandi amaherezo byagenze neza.
I did a lot of bad things	Nakoze ibintu byinshi nabi
Nothing like that now.	Nta kintu kimwe ubu.
Now I really don't think so	Ubu rwose ndakeka ko atari umuntu
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekereje kure
I just didn't know what to do	Gusa sinari nzi neza icyo kubikora
I had heard everything	Nari numvise byose
This is your family.	Uyu ni umuryango wawe.
I thought they were out	Natekereje ko bari hanze
I really have nothing	Mubyukuri ntacyo mfite
He was not sure what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo aricyo.
Play time	Igihe cyo gukina.
He has to hear something bad.	Agomba kumva ikintu kibi.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
That's great for me.	Nibyiza cyane kuri njye.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
He is a very kind and intelligent person.	Numuntu mwiza cyane kandi ufite ubwenge.
I think he is right and he is right	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri kandi avuga neza

I really can't see it now	Ntabwo rwose nshobora kubona ubu
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
Seeing what he says is true	Kureba ibyo avuga nukuri
I think the boy saw his family	Ntekereza ko umuhungu yabonye umuryango we
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
I am the last person who needs to live now.	Ndi umuntu wa nyuma akeneye kubana nonaha.
I really don't know why	Ntabwo rwose nzi impamvu abikora
He did not say what.	Ntabwo yavuze icyo.
No one knew where to go.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho agomba kujya.
I don't want to go back.	Sinshaka gusubira inyuma.
I didn't really see how that happened	Ntabwo rwose nabonye uko ibyo byagenze
I always think	Ntekereza buri gihe
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
Not here or here today.	Ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano muri iki gihe.
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, wabonye nabi.
Every night	Buri joro.
It was not easy to live together	Ntabwo byari byoroshye kubana
I have to think.	Ngomba gutekereza.
He was not, he saw, alone.	Ntiyari we, yabonye, ​​wenyine.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I never got the chance	Sinigeze mbona amahirwe
Of all the people.	Muri abantu rwose.
I just know it's not true.	Gusa nzi ko atari ukuri.
I really saw that	Nabonye ibyo rwose
He had been doing this for a long time.	Yari amaze igihe kinini abikora.
I love both.	Nkunda bombi.
But not for long.	Ariko si igihe kirekire.
But this is me.	Ariko uyu ni njye.
I was really scared for a while	Nagize ubwoba rwose mugihe gito
I thought he needed a drink	Natekereje ko akeneye kunywa
Hearing things.	Kumva ibintu.
He is very young.	Ari muto cyane.
No one can really help.	Nta muntu ushobora gufasha rwose.
He has a gift.	Afite impano.
He had time for everyone.	Yari afite umwanya kuri buri wese.
Maybe we should wait.	Ahari tugomba gutegereza.
Not really me.	Ntabwo ari njye rwose.
I would do it	Nari kubikora
He has.	Afite.
I want to believe, however	Ndashaka kwizera, ariko
I want to see my friend.	Ndashaka kubona inshuti yanjye.
I didn't want to believe	Ntabwo nashakaga kwizera
He doesn't say.	Ntabwo avuga.
I want to know why	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu
We have children.	Dufite abana.
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
Bigger than me.	Kinini kundusha.
You can't be.	Ntushobora kuba.
I don't want to do it again.	Sinshaka kongera kubikora.
I have nothing for him.	Ntacyo mfite kuri we.
And he was beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza.
I'm just worried.	Mfite impungenge gusa.
I know that's what you think	Nzi ko aribyo utekereza
He was still a boy, but he was still a child.	Yari akiri umuhungu, ariko ntiyari akiri umwana.
I knew it was only once tonight.	Nari nzi ko iri joro rimwe gusa.
He knew he had made a mistake.	Yari azi ko yakoze amakosa.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
That's right! 	Nibyo!
I have to get out of here	Ngomba kuva hano
I was not the one for him	Ntabwo nari uwo kuri we
He never thought he would do it.	Ntiyari yatekereje ko azabikora.
I want to do it with him	Ndashaka kubikora hamwe na we
You had nothing.	Ntacyo wari ufite.
I think he started at a very young age	Ntekereza ko yatangiye akiri muto cyane
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
We are not afraid.	Ntabwo dufite ubwoba.
In front of him is his dog.	Imbere ye ni imbwa ye.
He had not been doing this for a long time.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe kinini abikora.
He has to hear.	Afite kumva.
He knew exactly what to do.	Yari azi neza icyo yari gukora.
I wonder why he does that	Ndabaza impamvu akora gutya
There is something else, however.	Hariho ikindi kintu, ariko.
I can't believe he was worried	Sinshobora kwizera ko yari afite impungenge
I wonder if it is.	Ndabaza iyo ari yo.
I have never heard of it before	Sinigeze numva mbere
Gone, gone.	Yagiye, yagiye.
I hope he can be there	Ndizera ko ashobora kuba ahari

I want to do it again.	Ndashaka kongera kubikora.
I know there's something wrong with him	Nzi ko hari ikintu kibi kuri we
He wanted nothing.	Ntacyo yashakaga.
I can't stop looking	Sinshobora guhagarika kureba
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
I'm sure he is	Nzi neza ko ari we
We were here before.	Twari hano mbere.
I have a lot to do today.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora uyu munsi.

Hopefully we can do it again soon	Nizere ko dushobora kongera kubikora byose vuba aha

I know nothing about him.	Ntacyo nzi kuri we.
I need that for me.	Nkeneye ibyo kuri njye.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
My wife will be home soon.	Umugore wanjye azaba murugo vuba.
That's great	Nibyiza cyane
And he can do it here	Kandi arashobora kubikora hano
But all of this was not true.	Ariko ibyo byose ntabwo byari ukuri.
I never thought this was possible	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ibi bishoboka
It was a great time for me.	Byari umwanya mwiza kuri njye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, birashoboka gukora.
He never heard or spoke.	Ntiyigeze yumva kandi ntiyigeze avuga.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
This is very good.	Iyi ni nziza cyane.
Really here and there.	Nukuri hano na hano.
I want a beautiful wife	Ndashaka umugore mwiza
There is no need to talk about that.	Nta mpamvu yo kuvuga kuri ibyo.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
I know a lot of things.	Nzi ibintu byinshi.
I know you can do anything	Nzi ko ushobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You don't know where you are.	Ntabwo uzi aho uri.
I have to make money.	Ngomba gushaka amafaranga.
I want to hear his problem	Ndashaka kumva ikibazo cye
It wasn’t much to see.	Ntabwo byari byinshi byo kubona.
He knew where he was.	Yari azi aho ari.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
I would like to spend some time alone with you	Ndashaka umwanya muto wenyine hamwe nawe
I had that day	Uwo munsi nari mfite
I'm sure it will	Nzi neza ko bizaba
I think he wanted to take us inside	Ntekereza ko yashakaga kujyana natwe imbere
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi ikindi avuga.
I was a long way off	Nari kure cyane ku kintu
He didn't want to know.	Ntabwo yashakaga kumenya.
Especially not that.	Cyane cyane ntabwo aribyo.
That's not really the case.	Ibyo mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I wasn’t good, but it was probably scary	Ntabwo nari mwiza, ariko birashoboka ko byari ubwoba
I guess we should have	Ndakeka ko tugomba kugira
I should have gone.	Nari nkwiye kujyana.
I'm glad he told me	Nishimiye ko yambwiye
I think you can say a lot about that.	Ntekereza ko ushobora kuvuga byinshi muri ibyo.
I don't think there is anything you can do.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko hari icyo ushobora gukora.
He had to leave school before.	Yagombaga kuva mu ishuri mbere.
You have me.	Ufite njye.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
Thirty years.	Imyaka mirongo itatu.
I am very happy to help	Nishimiye cyane gufasha
I found a good plan for that	Nabonye gahunda nziza kubyo
You can work and walk.	Urashobora gukora no kugenda.
I didn't need that.	Sinari nkeneye ibyo.
He thought I could do this	Yatekereje ko nshobora gukora ibi
Go back.	Gusubira inyuma.
She is dressed and speaks well.	Yambaye kandi avuga neza.
This was a wonderful experience.	Ibi byari ibintu byiza cyane.
Just new friends.	Gusa inshuti nshya.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.

He did not go to the same school.	Ntabwo yagiye mu ishuri rimwe.
But he had to try.	Ariko yagombaga kugerageza.
I guess.	Ndakeka.
He is very close.	Ari hafi cyane.

I've seen it so far.	Nabonye kugeza ubu.
And it's good here.	Kandi ni byiza hano.
There is something wrong inside.	Imbere hari ikintu kibi.
No one could believe it.	Nta muntu n'umwe yashoboraga kwizera.
He went.	Yagiye.
Thirty years.	Imyaka mirongo itatu.
They knew how to take my money.	Bari bazi neza gufata amafaranga yanjye.
I know you need to get back to work	Nzi ko ukeneye gusubira ku kazi
A very long time.	Igihe kinini cyane.
I thought about this	Natekereje kuri ibi
That's not an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Everything was going wrong.	Ibintu byose byari byagenze nabi.
He was not far away.	Ntabwo yari kure cyane.
There are a lot of problems here.	Ibibazo ni byinshi hano.
And not much.	Kandi si byinshi.
He is out of all of us	Niwe uri hanze muri twese
It was good.	Byari byiza.
The same thing.	Icyo kintu kimwe.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I make a mistake.	Nkora amakosa.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
We have a lot to go on.	Dufite byinshi byo kugenda.

Eventually he could see inside.	Amaherezo yashoboraga kubona imbere.
He did it all.	Yabikoze byose.

That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyo yari akeneye.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
Maybe a movie, or something.	Ahari firime, cyangwa ikindi kintu.
I want the same thing	Ndashaka ikintu kimwe
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
I don't know how to do it.	Ntazi kubikora.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I was looking for money.	Nashakaga amafaranga.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
I know this is not all	Nzi ko ibi atari byose
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
But he had it all.	Ariko yari afite byose.

The family is very active.	Umuryango ukora cyane.
And he was a talented player.	Kandi yari umukinnyi ufite impano.

Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.

Now I know what.	Ubu nzi icyo.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
And it was absolutely true.	Kandi byari ukuri rwose.
I was looking for something else.	Nashakaga ikindi kintu.
Anyone could say anything.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kuvuga ikintu cyose.
I need time to do this	Nkeneye igihe cyo gukora ibi

So far, everything has gone well.	Kugeza ubu, byose byagenze neza.
Not like me	Ntabwo nkanjye.
I didn't have much to say about that	Ntabwo nari mfite byinshi byo kuvuga kuri ibyo
It will be the same.	Bizaba kimwe.
They were there.	Bari aho bari.
I wanted to stay here	Nashakaga kuguma hano

But you can't.	Ariko ntushobora.
I don't know who he is.	Sinzi uwo ari we.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
That's right.	Nibyo koko.
It’s a good thing to do.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.

She is a woman, and she does things.	Ni umugore, kandi akora ibintu.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza rwose.

But it really is.	Ariko rwose ni ibintu.
Maybe today.	Ahari uyu munsi.

That was very close.	Ibyo byari hafi cyane.
We need to know.	Tugomba kumenya.
I love clothes	Nkunda imyenda cyane
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.

I never thought I would do that	Sinigeze mbona ko nkora ibyo
He says it's good.	Avuga ko ari byiza.
The player is not.	Umukinnyi ntabwo.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
I ask this question.	Ndabaza iki kibazo.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
If so, that's fine.	Niba aribyo, nibyiza.
I need to make a big deal	Nkeneye gukora ikibazo kinini
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
It's too young.	Ndi muto.
He does not.	Ntabwo abikora.
He never made friends.	Ntiyigeze agira inshuti.
I needed to know what he was saying	Nari nkeneye kumenya ibyo avuga
I just want the truth	Ndashaka ukuri gusa
He had a house.	Yari afite inzu.
I found things to do.	Nabonye ibintu byo gukora.
He was very good at this.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri ibi.
I guess it's really not your fault	Ndakeka yuko mubyukuri atari amakosa yawe

I didn't know he was here.	Sinari nzi ko ari hano.

He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
Her baby is here.	Umwana we hano.

We are close now.	Ubu turi hafi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.

This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
Little did I know that there were many	Sinari nzi ko hari benshi
This was the best food they had.	Ibi byari ibiryo byiza bari bafite.
Lots of food.	Ibiryo byinshi.
But he must also come.	Ariko agomba no kuza.
No need to go.	Nta mpamvu yo kugenda.
I feel very happy with what happened	Ndumva nishimiye cyane uko byagenze
He was there to watch a movie.	Yari ahari kureba firime.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
I knew it was just a matter of time	Nari nzi ko ari ikibazo gusa
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I knew what he was going through	Nari nzi icyo agiye
I enjoyed everything	Nishimiye buri kintu cyose
It would be difficult, but possible.	Byaba bigoye, ariko birashoboka.
I can get to know everyone	Nshobora kumenya abantu bose
And I don’t have to.	Kandi ntagomba.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi.
I found something to eat	Nabonye icyo kurya
He tried again.	Yagerageje kandi.
I can learn a lot	Nshobora kwiga byinshi
And that was difficult.	Kandi ibyo byari bigoye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
You really shouldn't.	Mubyukuri ntugomba.
I did nothing good here	Nta cyiza nakoze hano
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.

He had to think a little.	Yagombaga gutekereza gato.
Knowing that he can do anything.	Kumenya ko ashobora gukora ikintu cyose.
I need someone who can do it right	Nkeneye umuntu ushobora kubikora neza
I was close, now	Nari hafi, nonaha
I did nothing	Ntacyo nakoze
Not always.	Ntabwo ari igihe cyose.
I should hear it tomorrow	Nkwiye kumva ejo

I like good and simple things.	Nkunda ibintu byiza kandi byoroshye.
He had a family.	Yari afite umuryango.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
Something with you.	Ikintu hamwe nawe.
I was here in my house	Nari hano mu nzu yanjye
It's good to have a plan.	Nibyiza kuba ufite gahunda.
I'm just scared.	Mfite ubwoba gusa.
I thought he felt the same way	Natekereje ko nawe yumva
But he went.	Ariko yagiye.
We have to be here.	Tugomba kuba hano.

All is well and simple.	Byose byiza kandi byoroshye.

You have to be here.	Ugomba kuba hano.
I didn’t want to think about anything else	Sinifuzaga gutekereza ikindi
I didn't think he was good enough.	Sinatekerezaga ko yari mwiza bihagije.
He could tell me he wanted to go home.	Yashoboraga kumbwira ko ashaka gutaha.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Is that right	Nibyo?
But he had none.	Ariko nta na kimwe yari afite.
He should not have lived with her.	Ntiyari akwiye kubana na we.
I have to be with you.	Ngomba kubana nanjye.
They have children.	Bafite abana.
And he was good.	Kandi yari nziza.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko.
I have nothing to do with this	Ntacyo nshobora gukora kuri ibi
You don't know what it is.	Ntabwo uzi icyo aricyo.
And that's not easy.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
I also thought he was a kid	Nanjye natekerezaga ko ari umwana
I never thought.	Sinigeze ntekereza.

I'm glad he was here.	Nishimiye ko yari hano.
I love everything you do	Nkunda ibyo ukora byose
We have nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe dufite.
We can't do this.	Ibi ntidushobora gukora.
She felt that way.	Yumvise ko atari byo.
He thought this was the case.	Yatekereje ko ibi aribyo.
We need to move as soon as possible.	Tugomba kugenda vuba bishoboka.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.

I never did a job	Ntabwo rwose nigeze nkora akazi
I'm really good at it	Ndi mwiza rwose mubyukuri
Getting things out of the way is easy.	Kubona ibintu byoroshye hanze.
I saw her hair	Nabonye umusatsi we
He was there too.	Na we yari ahari.
We have to work hard now	Tugomba gukora cyane ubu
In fact he did nothing.	Mubyukuri nta kintu na kimwe yakoze.
You know what you are.	Uzi icyo uri cyo.
I can't do that right now	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora nonaha
I think I'm a woman	Ntekereza ko ndi umugore
It's not a good thing to do.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza cyangwa cyiza cyo gukora.
People are not always lucky.	Abantu ntabwo buri gihe bafite amahirwe.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
If so, that's fine and fine.	Niba aribyo, nibyiza kandi byiza.
It's all about him.	Byose kuri we.

And they were scared.	Kandi bari bafite ubwoba.
And many are.	Kandi benshi ni.
I just need to eat.	Nkeneye kurya gusa.

But that's right.	Ariko ibyo ni byo.

Or if you are working.	Cyangwa niba urimo gukora.

Luckily, everyone has a job	Mfite amahirwe, abantu bose bafite akazi

Eventually, he saw something.	Amaherezo, yabonye ikintu.

He felt anxious.	Yumvise afite impungenge.

And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.

He never had the opportunity to.	Ntiyigeze agira amahirwe yo.
I hope you can do it	Ndizera ko ushobora kubikora
He did it well.	Yabikoze neza.
He looked outside and thought.	Yarebye hanze atekereza.
I think it's good to go.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza kugenda.
It was really good	Byari byiza rwose
I was not sure when.	Sinari nzi neza igihe.
I hope tomorrow is good	Nizere ko ejo ari byiza
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.

That was true.	Ko byari ukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He can do something.	Arashobora gukora ikintu.
No problem so far.	Nta kibazo kugeza ubu.
I didn’t want to know any of that	Sinifuzaga kumenya kimwe muri byo
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
I need to know what happened	Nkeneye kumenya uko byagenze
I was behind him	Nari inyuma ye

That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He came to his senses.	Yaje aho ari.
I thought you could	Natekereje ko ushobora
I did nothing	Ntacyo nigeze nkora
Eating is good here.	Kurya ni byiza hano.
Apparently he didn't fully understand the problems he was having.	Biragaragara ko atigeze yumva neza ibibazo arimo.
I didn't know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo uri we
He could get away with doing anything.	Yashoboraga kuva mu gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I didn't see it here	Sinigeze mbona hano
I can't think of one today	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri kimwe muri iki gihe
But not today.	Ariko si muri iki gihe.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
He needed something big, something very bad.	Yari akeneye ikintu kinini, ikintu kibi cyane.
I will never have to see my family again	Ntabwo ngomba kongera kubona umuryango wanjye
I always thought you were so good to me	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko uri mwiza cyane kuri njye
And in fact, it is not difficult.	Kandi mubyukuri, ntabwo bigoye cyane.
Obviously there is a lot on the agenda.	Biragaragara ko hariho byinshi kuri gahunda.
We can now be friends	Ubu dushobora kuba inshuti
They have a lot.	Bafite byinshi.
I saw something	Nabonye ikintu
People were outside.	Abantu bari hanze.

It’s everyone in the movie.	Ni umuntu wese uri muri iyo firime.

He was inside.	Yari imbere.
We just have to work.	Tugomba gukora gusa.
I knew all this	Nari nzi ibi byose
At all times	Igihe cyose.
He could have done it again.	Yashoboraga kongera kubikora.

He looked ahead and walked away.	Yarebye imbere, agenda.
He thought well.	Yatekereje neza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo gusa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He had to do it alone.	Yagombaga kubikora wenyine.
He said he hoped to come.	Yavuze ko yizeye kuza.
Very good stuff.	Ibintu byiza cyane.
I feel almost everything	Ndumva hafi ya byose
I shouldn’t have done that.	Sinari nkwiye kubikora.
Opinion.	Igitekerezo.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
As if he were embarrassed.	Nkaho yari afite isoni.
I need to tell someone, just once.	Nkeneye kubwira umuntu, rimwe gusa.
This will actually be good in the long run.	Ibi mubyukuri bizaba byiza mugihe kirekire.
He started reading the book.	Yatangiye gusoma igitabo.
I didn't have time to do anything.	Sinari mfite umwanya wo gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I hope you feel the same way	Nizere ko nawe yumva ibintu kimwe
And near me.	Kandi hafi yanjye.
He was one young man.	Yari umusore umwe.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
I never thought.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza.
I never saw my wife all day	Umunsi wose sinigeze mbona umugore wanjye
And, my son has had the same problem.	Kandi, umuhungu wanjye yagiye agira ikibazo kimwe na we.
It's very similar to him.	Birasa cyane na we.
He is very.	Niwe cyane.
I have to do things right	Ngomba gukora ibintu neza
Just once.	Gusa rimwe.
He should not have been afraid.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kugira ubwoba.
I didn't have one either	Nanjye ntabwo nari mfite
You think you are.	Uratekereza ko uri.
I want to	Ninjye ushaka
The reasons are many.	Impamvu ni nyinshi.
I know they are here	Nzi ko bari hano
I know you're here.	Nzi ko uri hano.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I have to look bad	Ngomba kureba nabi
I am everything too	Nanjye ndi byose
With just a look.	Hamwe no kureba gusa.
Something in front of me.	Ikintu imbere yanjye.
I need something you know	Nkeneye ikintu uzi
You know how.	Uzi uburyo.
And he is here to stay.	Kandi ari hano kuguma.
You are human.	Uri umuntu.
The right time.	Umwanya ukwiye mugihe.
I had trouble walking	Nagize ikibazo cyo kugenda
I can't do it right	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora neza
You haven't been here.	Ntabwo wigeze hano.
I did nothing	Ntacyo nakoze
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I had only one idea	Nari mfite igitekerezo kimwe gusa
I think today is a good day	Ntekereza ko uyu munsi ari umunsi mwiza
'	'
I have never heard him say that before	Sinigeze numva avuga ibyo mbere
I saw no problem.	Nta kibazo nabonye.
Of course, today is not the day.	Nibyo, uyumunsi ntabwo ari umunsi.
I was really lucky	Nagize amahirwe rwose
I wanted to swim fast	Nashakaga koga vuba
I can do nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora.
Someone needs to have a say.	Umuntu akeneye kugira icyo avuga.
I know what you're up to.	Nzi ibyo urimo.
You can't do enough.	Ntushobora gukora bihagije.
He could do and say what he wanted.	Yashoboraga gukora no kuvuga icyo ashaka.
I wanted to win so badly	Nashakaga gutsinda nabi cyane
The house is everything they have.	Inzu ni ibyo bafite byose.
Have your day.	Kugira umunsi wawe.
Either way.	Yaba ari we.
I am in prison	Ninjye uri muri gereza
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
This is your chance.	Ubu ni amahirwe yawe.
I needed to catch up	Nari nkeneye gufata
I didn’t want to make a car at home	Sinifuzaga gukora imodoka murugo
I didn't want anything	Ntacyo nashakaga
In fact, she was my daughter.	Mubyukuri, yari umukobwa wanjye.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
It's too young.	Ni muto cyane.
I think this is very possible.	Ntekereza ko ibi bishoboka cyane.
And that's what he did here.	Kandi nibyo yakoze hano.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi uko ni ko byagenze.
I can't believe it is	Sinshobora kwizera ko aribyo
I think that's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko icyo ari ikintu cyiza.
I wanted to stay.	Nashakaga kuguma.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
In any case, he used to talk to her.	Ibyo ari byo byose, yakundaga kuvugana na we.
At that time I did not know.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi.
The child did nothing at all.	Umwana ntacyo yakoze rwose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
What we are.	Icyo turi cyo.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
One week is good.	Rimwe mu cyumweru nibyiza.
I can't buy that	Ntabwo nshobora kugura ibyo
Sometimes, you have to do it.	Rimwe na rimwe, ugomba kubikora.
But I can't figure out how to do it.	Ariko sinshobora kubona uburyo bwo kubikora.
He must.	Agomba.
They are just children.	Ni abana gusa.
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
I had a lot to know	Nari mfite byinshi byo kumenya
And that was not true.	Kandi ntabwo byari ukuri.
I like to help people	Nkunda gufasha abantu
I thought we were in this	Natekereje ko turi muri ibi
I never got the chance	Ntabwo nigeze mbona amahirwe
Travel time.	Igihe cyo kugenda.
There is now.	Hariho ubu.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I just think you have to take the time	Ndatekereza gusa ko ugomba gufata umwanya
Bose.	Bose.
I think this is a good thing at the time	Ntekereza ko iki ari ikintu cyiza icyo gihe
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
I have never seen one of those before	Sinigeze mbona kimwe muri ibyo mbere
I have someone, me too	Mfite umuntu, nanjye
What should he do?	Ni iki agomba gukora?.
And that would be great.	Kandi ibyo byaba byiza.
I was not in that	Ntabwo nari muri ibyo
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga neza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
You can't learn how to be lucky.	Ntushobora kwiga uburyo bwo kugira amahirwe.
Maybe he should go home.	Ahari agomba gutaha.
He was now alone.	Ubu yari wenyine wenyine.
This is true, if not true enough.	Ibi nukuri, niba atari ukuri bihagije.
I don't know how he does it	Ntabwo nzi uko abikora
I was not lucky	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe ahari
I know who you are	Nzi uwo uri we
Now I understand why.	Ubu ndumva impamvu.
I have to go back to work	Ngomba gusubira ku kazi
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
I didn't want to do that	Ntabwo nashakaga kubikora
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
I have a lot to do	Mfite byinshi byo gukora
I need to hear and see	Nkeneye kumva no kureba neza
Anyone can see.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubona.
But it happened very quickly	Ariko byagenze vuba cyane
It will be you and me.	Bizaba wowe na njye.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
It was one day before he left.	Wari umunsi umwe mbere yuko agenda.
He went.	Yagiye.
We have a great plan here.	Dufite gahunda nziza hano.
You really.	Wowe rwose.
Eventually it can go away again	Amaherezo arashobora kongera kugenda
And close.	Kandi hafi.
It has not been his clothes since that day.	Ntabwo ari imyenda ye kuva uwo munsi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I have never seen anything so beautiful.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ikintu cyiza cyane.
I'm the only one around here out there	Ndi hafi yanjye wenyine hano hanze
Not just us.	Ntabwo ari twe gusa.
It was just a simple way to tell the truth.	Byari byoroshye gusa uburyo bwo kuvuga ukuri.
I can't take all this	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ibi byose
I wanted to do all that	Nashakaga gukora ibyo byose
But if you had.	Ariko niba wari ufite.
This is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibi.
He has to be good.	Agomba kuba mwiza.
You had a short time.	Wari ufite igihe gito.
After all, he is the only one.	Amaherezo, ni we wenyine.
Coming to work.	Kuza ku kazi.
I'm not sure if we can do it again.	Sinzi neza niba dushobora kongera kubikora.
You too	Wowe nawe.
You don't know anything.	Ntabwo uzi ikintu na kimwe.
I got to work now.	Nabonye gukora ubu.

That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
Just work and eat.	Gusa gukora no kurya.
I know where he is talking	Nzi aho avuga
She knew in that look that he had failed her.	Yari azi ko adashaka kuvuga ibyo avuga.
No job.	Nta kazi.
Of course, I need to get back to work	Nukuri, nkeneye gusubira ku kazi
Instead of taking the money, he chose to stay.	Aho gufata amafaranga, yahisemo kuguma.
I'm going to drink.	Ngiye kunywa.
We have to act fast.	Tugomba gukora vuba.
I shouldn't have done that	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora
But here.	Ariko hano.
He knew full well and that was it.	Yari azi neza kandi aribyo.

We need to know for sure.	Tugomba kumenya neza.

I saw something he once told me.	Nabonye ikintu yigeze kumbwira.
He always knows what to do.	Buri gihe azi icyo gukora.
I don't know why this is so difficult.	Ntabwo nzi impamvu ibi bigoye cyane.
We are in the truth.	Turi mu kuri.

He looked closely.	Yarebye neza neza.
But this was easier said than done.	Ariko ibi byari byoroshye kuvuga kuruta gukora.
I want to see what he thinks	Ndashaka kureba icyo atekereza
That's all there is to it.	Ibyo byose ni ikintu.

Normally it was normal	Mu bisanzwe byari bisanzwe
You can't take time.	Ntushobora gufata igihe.
He asked if anyone wanted to go back.	Yabajije niba hari ushaka gusubira inyuma.

You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kureba gusa.
Now he really wants to.	Ubu arashaka rwose.
The questions are similar.	Ibibazo birasa.
I wanted to know more	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi

I enjoyed the questions.	Nishimiye ibibazo.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.

He has to do what he wants.	Agomba gukora ibyo ashaka.
I never heard what I meant	Sinigeze numva nshaka kuvuga

And he used to come home with something.	Kandi yakundaga gutaha afite ikintu.
But everyone knows what happened then.	Ariko abantu bose bazi uko byagenze icyo gihe.

Today.	Muri iki gihe.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo.
I have to go with everything now	Ngomba kujyana byose ubu
But you have to do things.	Ariko ugomba gukora ibintu.
You can't see anything.	Ntushobora kubona ikintu na kimwe.
No one at all	Nta muntu n'umwe rwose
I was not happy at home, when he was there	Ntabwo nishimiye murugo, igihe yari ahari
That is my advice.	Iyo ni yo nama yanjye.
I really believe he meant what he said	Nizera rwose ko yashakaga kuvuga ibyo yavuze
I can't take much	Sinshobora gufata byinshi
I didn't know he was going home	Sinari nzi ko agiye murugo
I made really good friends	Nagize inshuti nziza rwose
I think that's what you're looking for.	Ntekereza ko aribyo urimo gushaka.
I thought to myself	Natekerezaga muri njye
He thought he was not in this.	Yatekereje ko atari muri ibi.
I'm not sure if this is true.	Sinzi neza niba ibi ari ukuri.
I can't wait for that time	Sinshobora gutegereza icyo gihe
I can take a job here	Nshobora gufata akazi hano
He thought he could win this.	Yatekereje ko ashobora gutsinda iki kintu.
I like to do it	Nkunda kubikora
But you have to try to come.	Ariko ugomba kugerageza kuza.
When things were going well.	Mugihe ibintu byari byiza.
Whatever you need.	Icyo ukeneye cyose.
The girl did everything.	Umukobwa yakoze byose.
I didn't know what he wanted	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga
I knew someone had to know something	Nari nzi ko umuntu agomba kumenya ikintu
You or anyone else.	Wowe cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese.
But she is his first wife.	Ariko ni umugore we wa mbere.
I have nothing to say so far	Ntacyo nshobora kuvuga kugeza ubu
You got your money.	Wabonye amafaranga yawe.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
You have to come forward.	Ugomba kuza imbere.
I know what to do about it.	Nzi icyo gukora kuri ibyo.
More than ever.	Kurenza ikindi gihe cyose.
But now nothing.	Ariko ubu nta kintu na kimwe.
I was thinking all day about what to do.	Natekerezaga umunsi wose icyo gukora.
Here's a tip.	Hano hari inama.
He may not have lived here.	Birashoboka ko atigeze aba hano.
He was right, too.	Na we yari afite ukuri.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari azi.
But that I guess.	Ariko ibyo ndakeka.
I never thought	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza
Really nice guy	Umuntu rwose, mwiza cyane
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
I did something good.	Nakoze ikintu cyiza.
Sometimes, it would be once a week.	Rimwe na rimwe, byaba rimwe mu cyumweru.
You are the only one.	Uri umwe gusa.
Maybe someone would stay home.	Ahari umuntu yaba murugo.
I was very lucky	Nagize amahirwe cyane
But then at that time.	Ariko icyo gihe icyo gihe.
I didn't know much about him.	Ntabwo nari nzi byinshi kuri we.
To live.	Kubaho.
He's gone now, he's not here.	Yagiye ubu, ntabwo ari hano.
He said he was at work.	Yavuze ko yari ku kazi.
That's what he does.	Nibyo akora.
I have a lot of money now	Mfite amafaranga menshi ubu
Or do it.	Cyangwa kubikora.
Either way, that’s enough for me.	Ibyo ari byo byose, bihagije kuri njye.
Drinking was good.	Kunywa byari byiza.
I think you know where	Ndatekereza ko uzi aho
I think it's time.	Ntekereza ko ari igihe.
I know you're scared.	Nzi ko ufite ubwoba.
The car is gone.	Imodoka yagiye.
He was a young man.	Uwo yari umusore.
They are not children. '	Ntabwo ari abana '.
I only have one day to wait	Mfite umunsi umwe gusa wo gutegereza
Too much talk.	Kuvuga cyane.
You can buy anything you want here.	Urashobora kugura icyo ushaka cyose hano.
I'm glad it happened	Nishimiye ko byagenze vuba
It was a gift.	Byari impano.
Stop what he said.	Kureka uko yavuze.
I have absolutely no reason not to do so.	Ntabwo rwose mfite impamvu yo kutabikora.
This is not really the case.	Ibi mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
You don’t have to have something good to do.	Ntugomba kugira ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
And the man began to walk.	Kandi uwo muntu yatangiye kugenda.
Let's i.	Reka i.
I don't need help.	Ntabwo nkeneye ubufasha.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yari afite ubwoba.
I feel the same way.	Nanjye ndumva ari kimwe.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I have to have this, please	Ngomba kugira ibi, nyamuneka
I thought it would be nice	Natekereje ko byaba byiza
He thought to himself.	Yatekereje wenyine.
I needed a drink or something	Nari nkeneye kunywa cyangwa ikindi kintu
Maybe he has.	Birashoboka ko afite.
I think we need to know more about it	Ntekereza ko dukeneye kumenya byinshi kuri byo
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
We have things we need to get on schedule.	Dufite ibintu dukeneye kubona kuri gahunda.
I thought we could do it	Natekerezaga ko dushobora kubikora
There is something we can try.	Hariho ikintu dushobora kugerageza.
He didn't say anything to me.	Nta cyo yambwiye.
And you can be together again.	Kandi urashobora kongera kubana.
That's good, really.	Nibyiza, rwose.
We had nothing to say.	Ntacyo twari dufite cyo kuvuga.
I am the only one	Ninjye wenyine.
I didn't need to work	Sinari nkeneye gukora
Playing is good.	Gukina ni byiza.
You are a person with things.	Uri umuntu ufite ibintu.
No one had done it before.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari wabikoze mbere.
I like the way he walks	Nkunda uburyo agenda
You can talk to him later.	Urashobora kuvugana nawe nyuma.
And not much.	Kandi si byinshi.
I wanted my money	Nashakaga amafaranga yanjye
You are his wife.	Uri umugore we.
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
We are really human.	Turi abantu rwose.
It was all.	Byari byose.
It's nothing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu na kimwe.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga no kumva.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko aribyo.
I am friends with both.	Ndi inshuti kuri bombi.
I didn't know what to say	Sinari nzi icyo avuga
I really need to talk to you today	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana nawe uyu munsi
But I felt good.	Ariko numvise ari byiza.
He thought I was a good player	Yatekereje ko ndi umukinnyi mwiza
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki?.
I hope they would say the same about me	Nizera ko bari kuvuga kimwe kuri njye
One thing, however, we need to be aware of.	Ikintu kimwe, ariko, tugomba kumenya neza.
He felt anxious.	Yumvise afite impungenge.
I can't live with you	Sinshobora kubana nawe
That will be tomorrow though.	Ibyo bizaba ejo naho.
I guess that's normal	Ndakeka ko ibyo ari ibintu bisanzwe
He can't see and feel well.	Ntashobora kubona no kumva neza.
A woman who looks good	Umugore usa neza
I want to buy a car.	Ndashaka kugura imodoka.
But for everyone.	Ariko kuri buri wese.
This is a simple matter.	Ibi ni ibintu byoroshye.
He was too.	Na we yari.
I wanted to know everything	Nashakaga kumenya byose
We have problems.	Dufite ibibazo.
I doubt anyone ever did that	Ndashidikanya ko umuntu yigeze kubikora
But it turned out very well.	Ariko byagenze neza cyane.
He agreed to buy.	Yemeye kugura.
I was very low	Nari hasi cyane
If i or ya.	Niba i cyangwa ya.
I didn't want to do anything wrong	Sinifuzaga gukora ibintu nabi
I ask why.	Ndabaza impamvu.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni byiza kuri ibyo.
It looks bad on the outside.	Birasa nabi hanze.
Can't we just live together?	Ntidushobora kubana gusa?.
I'm sure that's it	Nzi neza ko aribyo
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka rwose.
The child does what he wants.	Umwana akora ibyo ashaka.
I want my money	Ndashaka amafaranga yanjye
I don't need anything.	Ntacyo nkeneye.
He wants to talk to you.	Ashaka kuvugana nawe.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
It would have been easier.	Byari kuba byoroshye.
I guess so.	Ndakeka ko aribyo.
I never saw a problem	Nta kibazo nigeze mbona
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
I think it would be nice	Ndakeka ko byaba byiza
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
I always get first place	Buri gihe mbona umwanya wa mbere
I love it when it does	Nkunda iyo abikora
I need to know everything	Ngomba kumenya byose
He took everything down.	Yafashe ibintu byose hasi.
This is actually the case.	Ibi mubyukuri.
He did not want to stay and help anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kuguma no gufasha umuntu.
He had a good idea.	Yari afite igitekerezo cyiza.
He was no longer around her.	Ntabwo yari akiri hafi ye.
Just want something else.	Gusa ushaka ikindi kintu.
I want to leave here soon.	Ndashaka kuva hano vuba.
After.	Nyuma ya.
And nothing wrong.	Kandi nta kibi.
It is not inside.	Ntabwo ari imbere.
I think that's all	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo byose
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko kugenda vuba.
He came prepared with a plan.	Yaje yiteguye afite gahunda.
We have only one son.	Dufite umuhungu umwe gusa.
I really like the idea	Nkunda igitekerezo cyane
You can't go this far.	Ntushobora kugenda iki gihe.
You can tell.	Urashobora kubwira.
You know how it works.	Uzi uko akora.
He has to take care of everything himself.	Agomba gutwara byose wenyine.
He needed to talk to someone.	Yari akeneye kuvugana n'umuntu.
And they are all friends.	Kandi bose ni inshuti.
I have this all the time.	Mfite ibi igihe cyose.
I think it's good to go	Ntekereza ko ari byiza kugenda
And, at no.	Kandi, kuri no.
I never had to	Sinigeze ngomba kubikora
I was going to buy clothes	Nari ngiye kugura imyenda
It was a beautiful day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza cyane.
Nothing here.	Nta na kimwe hano.
We have to learn.	Tugomba kwiga.
Sometimes doing wrong.	Rimwe na rimwe gukora nabi.
I have been thinking about this for a long time	Natekereje kuri ibi igihe kirekire
I know what you're doing	Nzi icyo urimo gukora
I never thought he would be scared	Sinari natekereje ko ashobora kugira ubwoba
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
But he looked just like me.	Ariko yasaga nkanjye.
First wife.	Umugore wa mbere.
I was.	Nari njye.
But he is happy to be back.	Ariko yishimiye gutaha.
He has to do something	Agomba kugira icyo akora
People you need to know.	Abantu ugomba kumenya.
What we need is a good person.	Icyo dukeneye ni umuntu mwiza.
He did.	Yabikoze.
I knew we needed to get out of here	Nari nzi ko dukeneye kuva hano
He didn't want to know.	Ntabwo yashakaga kumenya.
You know your child.	Uzi umwana wawe.
They all had a school	Bose bari bafite ishuri
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I have a lot to do	Mfite byinshi byo gukora
He wanted help.	Yashakaga ubufasha.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
I'm not sure if that's the case	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo
We really needed it.	Twari dukeneye rwose.
I am here and today	Ndi hano kandi no muri iki gihe
I'm inside and out	Ndi imbere no hanze
He had a long time.	Yari afite igihe kirekire.
I can live with anyone	Nshobora kubana n'umuntu uwo ari we wese
I can say everything	Nshobora kuvuga ibintu byose
He found a way.	Yabonye uburyo.
Either way, that was good for me.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ibyo byari byiza kuri njye.
I had nothing	Ntacyo nari mfite
I feel that way	Ndumva aribyo rwose
You have to be good.	Ugomba kuba mwiza.
I didn’t know many people.	Sinari nzi abantu benshi.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
They were so many.	Bari benshi cyane.
He wanted to be close.	Yashakaga kuba hafi.
I think the same.	Ndatekereza kimwe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hafi ya byose.
I could be worse	Nshobora kuba mubi cyane
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
I knew what we needed to do	Nari nzi icyo dukeneye gukora
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibi byari amakosa.
I need to know what he was going to say	Nkeneye kumenya icyo yari agiye kuvuga
My family wants the truth.	Umuryango wanjye urashaka ukuri.
You are not sure if that is the case.	Ntabwo uzi neza niba aribyo.
I think he is the worst	Ntekereza ko ari we mubi cyane
I can't say for sure	Sinshobora kuvuga neza
I believe what he says	Nizera ibyo avuga
I know he did.	Nzi ko yabikoze.
I could see that he liked that	Nari kubona ko akunda ibyo
I think for now you have to stay with us	Ndatekereza ko kuri ubu ugomba kuguma hamwe natwe
That's possible.	Nibyo birashoboka.
Good day people	Umunsi mwiza abantu.
I wanted to be with you	Nashakaga kubana nawe
I know where they are	Nzi aho bari
I really want to talk to you.	Ndashaka rwose kuvugana nawe.
One has to.	Umuntu agomba.
I think she was hairy	Ntekereza ko yari umusatsi
This time it is possible.	Iki gihe birashoboka.
Who would have thought.	Ninde wari gutekereza.
I can't say why today	Sinshobora kuvuga impamvu muri iki gihe
You have a problem coming.	Ufite ikibazo cyo kuza.
I saw it all	Nabonye byose
I never wanted him to go	Sinigeze nshaka ko agenda
You do what you have to do.	Ukora ibyo ugomba.
I never believed that.	Sinigeze nizera ko aribyo.
I feel that way.	Ndumva aribyo rwose.
I think you really have to do it	Ndatekereza ko ugomba rwose kubikora
I guess so	Ndakeka ko aribyo
I thought, he was just scared	Natekereje, afite ubwoba gusa
But there is a catch.	Ariko hariho gufata.
If so, that's fine.	Niba aribyo, nibyiza.
I have a problem learning a lot	Mfite ikibazo cyo kwiga byinshi
I could never eat that way	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kurya gutya
I did not know	Ntabwo nari nzi
In fact, he is the highest.	Mubyukuri, niwe uri hejuru.
I was afraid to speak.	Nari mfite ubwoba bwo kuvuga.
But that is probably not the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko ibyo atari byo.
He wanted something else.	Yashakaga ikindi kintu.
Apparently he didn't know the first thing about it.	Biragaragara ko atari azi ikintu cya mbere kuri ibyo.
He did it in a short time.	Yabikoze mu gihe gito.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
You are the problem.	Ni wowe kibazo.
Only.	Gusa.
Many outside.	Benshi hanze.
I need to know if there is.	Ngomba kumenya niba ahari.
I think you may be right	Ndatekereza ko ushobora kuba ufite ukuri
I wanted to know who he was	Nashakaga kumenya uwo ari we
That is not the case with him.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri we.
Live well.	Kubaho neza.
I never saw him worry.	Sinigeze mbona afite impungenge.
I can never walk away from you	Sinshobora kongera kugenda kure yawe
And that's fine.	Kandi nibyiza.
I can't get out of that	Ntabwo nshobora kuva kuri ibyo
I knew what he meant.	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
None of us can get out of this.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ushobora kuva muri ibi.
He may have a friend.	Ashobora kuba afite inshuti.
I really needed it	Nari nkeneye cyane
Maybe in the near future, but definitely not.	Ahari mugihe cya vuba, ariko rwose sibyo.
It would be nice for him if he did.	Byari kuba byiza kuri we iyo abikora.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
He never had to go back.	Nta na hamwe yagombaga gusubira inyuma.
He didn't need to say much.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kuvuga byinshi.
It was probably his age.	Birashoboka ko yari imyaka ye.
I didn’t want a problem	Ntabwo nashakaga ikibazo
That's exactly what we needed.	Nibyo rwose twari dukeneye.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
I should have gone.	Nari nkwiye kujyana.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I think it will be very soon	Ntekereza ko bizaba vuba cyane
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
I did something else	Nakoze ikindi kintu
Only for him.	Kuri we gusa.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
But now, he said.	Ariko, ubu yavuze.
I know you have a lot to do.	Nzi ko ufite byinshi byo gukora.
He was not in me.	Ntabwo yari muri njye.
So far everything has worked out.	Kugeza ubu byose byagenze neza.
I really want more people.	Ndashaka abantu benshi mubyukuri.
It was what it was and it was.	Yari icyo aricyo kandi aricyo.
I thought that was enough	Natekerezaga ko ibyo byari bihagije
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo aricyo.
I would like to apply.	Ndashaka gusaba.
we can do it.	dushobora kubikora.
I can't take it anymore	Sinshobora kongera gufata
I have the same problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe
No one had money.	Nta muntu wari ufite amafaranga.
Boy	Umuhungu.
We have a son.	Dufite umuhungu.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
I just thought you might know something	Gusa natekereje ko ushobora kumenya ikintu
At all times	Igihe cyose.
We can't do this.	Ntidushobora gukora ibi.
They are just worried.	Bafite impungenge gusa.
I was not wrong	Ntabwo nari mfite nabi
I have seen very bad people	Nabonye abantu mubi cyane
I haven't seen much of it	Sinigeze mbona byinshi muri byo
Things he shouldn't know.	Ibintu atagomba kumenya.
That he had to live again.	Ko yagombaga kongera kubaho.
I thought about going	Natekereje kugenda
I knew you were	Nari nzi ko urimo
I know there are many here	Nzi ko hano hari benshi
I'm going to take the truth.	Ngiye gufata ukuri.
It was something.	Yari ikintu.
I wanted that from the beginning	Nashakaga ibyo kuva mbere
And he would go.	Kandi yari kugenda.
He could hear nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kumva.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He just wanted to hear.	Yashakaga gusa kumva.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
I just know that someone has problems	Gusa nzi ko umuntu afite ibibazo
I know it is.	Nzi ko ari.
This is not all.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo gusa.
Far and near.	Kure na hafi.
I was one of the latter.	Nari umwe muri aba nyuma.
I have a plan	Mfite gahunda
It's you	Ni wowe.
I should have done it earlier	Nari nkwiye kubikora kare
He could have had something else.	Birashoboka ko yashoboraga kugira ikindi.
But he wants to talk.	Ariko arashaka kuvuga.
I never liked a guy	Sinigeze nkunda umusore
I just thought it would be nice	Gusa natekereje ko byaba byiza
I guess he was right	Ndakeka ko yari afite ukuri
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
I want to hear what you think	Ndashaka kumva uko utekereza
I think that's my fault	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari amakosa yanjye
I can't speak for everyone.	Sinshobora kuvuga kuri bose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kinini kinini.
He claims to be.	Niwe avuga ko ari.
I know it's hard	Nzi ko bigoye
He would not be who he is now.	Ntabwo yari kuba uwo yari we ubu.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I thought it was great.	Natekereje ko ari nziza cyane.
I'm sure today.	Nzi neza ko uyu munsi.
He says there is no problem.	Avuga ko nta kibazo.
You have it all.	Ufite byose.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
I can eat well	Nshobora kurya ibiryo neza
Ari.	Ari.
There is a lot to say about this later.	Hariho byinshi byo kuvuga kuri ibi nyuma.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
I had nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari mfite
I desperately needed a plan today	Nari nkeneye cyane gahunda muri iki gihe
I have, you have, we all have	Mfite, ufite, twese dufite
I just didn't know that	Gusa sinari nzi ko aribyo
But now it's like.	Ariko ubu ni nka.
And it would be easy.	Kandi byaba byoroshye.
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari yo mpamvu.
I want to live	Ndashaka kubaho
I'm not sure	Ntabwo nzi neza rwose
I never thought far	Sinigeze ntekereza kure
But too many were.	Ariko benshi cyane bari.
He said that was good.	Yavuze ko ibyo ari byiza.
I think they would do well	Ndakeka ko bari gukora neza
I want to know where you are	Ndashaka aho uri
A scary player.	Umukinnyi ufite ubwoba.
I have a lot to live for.	Mfite byinshi byo kubaho.
That was easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye.
It will be after him.	Bizaba nyuma ye.
I know where they are now.	Nzi aho bari ubu.
You don't think enough.	Ntabwo utekereza bihagije.
Teacher, you think.	Umwarimu, utekereza.
Was he there?	Yari ahari?
He needs to go.	Akeneye kugenda.
I just have something for him	Gusa mfite ikintu kuri we
I was looking for a friend	Nashakaga inshuti
You really have to.	Ugomba rwose.
He can win.	Ashobora gutsinda.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
I have an early morning	Mfite ejo kare
He probably doesn't know what else to say.	Birashoboka ko atari azi ikindi avuga.
Not one.	Ntabwo ari umwe.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
I don't need to go into that here	Ntabwo nkeneye kujya muri ibyo hano
We have time.	Dufite umwanya.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I need something to eat	Nkeneye icyo kurya
I didn't need to be here	Sinari nkeneye kuba hano
Good after a good meal.	Nibyiza nyuma yo kurya neza.
He would not even leave his house.	Ntiyari no kuva mu nzu ye.
I want to go home again	Ndashaka gutaha kandi
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
I didn't want to go to jail	Sinifuzaga kujya muri gereza
You have to think for everyone.	Ugomba gutekereza kuri bose.
I was looking for time alone	Nashakaga umwanya wenyine wenyine
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
I don't want to get married.	Sinshaka gushaka.
Someone had to do it	Umuntu yagombaga kubikora
It's easy now.	Byoroshye nonaha.
I know a lot of things.	Nzi ibintu byinshi.
I know you know what happened	Nzi ko uzi uko byagenze
I need to know if you have	Nkeneye kumenya niba ufite
I knew it was easy	Nari nzi ko hari byoroshye
I should have been scared	Nari nkwiye kugira ubwoba
I want to stay here!	Ndashaka kuguma hano!
I know how that is possible	Nzi uburyo ibyo bishoboka
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
It is your chance to live.	Ni amahirwe yawe yo kubaho.
I hope to do the job	Nizera gukora akazi
I needed to read more	Nari nkeneye gusoma byinshi
He is not his father.	Ntabwo ari se.
We have to look ahead.	Tugomba kureba imbere.
I have time.	Mfite igihe.
I love your daughter	Nkunda umukobwa wawe
And that was it today.	Kandi ibyo byari uyu munsi.
I thought it was good	Natekerezaga ko ari byiza
I can't figure out what he thinks	Sinshobora kumenya icyo atekereza
If she is also a girl.	Niba kandi ari umukobwa.
But that was short-lived.	Ariko ibyo byari igihe gito.
He was still there.	Yari akiri aho.
It was great	Byari byiza cyane
I enjoyed that day	Nishimiye uwo munsi
He needed food.	Yari akeneye ibiryo.
I was not good.	Ntabwo nari mwiza.
I mean, I'm pretty sure he can do it right	Ndashaka kuvuga, nzi neza ko ashobora gukora neza
It was simple enough.	Byari byoroshye bihagije.
I think he might as well live	Ntekereza ko ashobora no kubaho
He got what he wanted.	Yabonye icyo yashakaga.
Everyone outside.	Abantu bose hanze.
I guess he has a reason	Ndakeka ko afite impamvu
He has it all.	Afite byose.
I never saw that.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo.
A friend is someone you love.	Inshuti numuntu ukunda.
You can only watch.	Urashobora kureba gusa.
I can't come to eat.	Sinshobora kuza kurya.
You too.	Wowe na we.
They know the truth.	Bazi ukuri.
You are my son.	Uri umuhungu wanjye.
Shame.	Isoni.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
I like this question.	Nkunda iki kibazo.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
They have the same commonalities.	Bafite ibintu bisanzwe kimwe.
I can't try.	Sinshobora kugerageza.
You have to think hard about what you do.	Ugomba gutekereza cyane kubyo ukora.
You are a good person.	Uri umuntu mwiza.
I am very happy to buy.	Nishimiye cyane kugura.
So far so good.	Kugeza vuba aha nibyo.
I can't take anything else.	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ikindi.
He did not tell the truth.	Ntabwo yavuze ukuri.
I don't know what.	Sinzi icyo.
There is so much to think about.	Hariho byinshi byo gutekereza.
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
I guess that’s just something	Ndakeka ko ari ikintu gusa
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi.
You have to come home.	Ugomba kuza murugo.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
But at the time, he had many problems.	Ariko icyo gihe yari afite ibibazo byinshi.
There is one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe.
I can't talk to you right now	Sinshobora kuvugana nawe ubu
He is alone.	We wenyine.
At that time.	Muri icyo gihe.
And until then.	Kandi kugeza icyo gihe.
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza
He had no place to live.	Ntiyari afite aho aba.
I want more to do	Ndashaka byinshi kubikora
I think he will do it right	Ndatekereza ko azabikora neza
It is not good for us.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri twe.
I knew it was going to be very easy	Nari nzi ko byari byoroshye cyane
I just have.	Mfite gusa.
You can't really do that.	Ntushobora rwose kubikora.
I just wanted to do something	Nashakaga gusa icyo gukora
Sometimes I thought about quitting	Rimwe na rimwe natekereje kureka
She feels close.	Yumva ko ari hafi.
You have to stay here.	Ugomba kuguma hano.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was not good but it was very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza ariko byari byiza cyane.
He needed money badly.	Yari akeneye amafaranga nabi.
You love children so much.	Ukunda abana cyane.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
I shouldn’t have gone back	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gusubira inyuma
I wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ikintu kibi
This is not exactly the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I never saw it clearly	Ntabwo nigeze mbona neza
It's best to do it.	Nibyiza kubikora.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He may be there.	Ashobora kuba ahari.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I work all the time	Nkora igihe cyose
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
I saw.	Nabonye.
That's a good thing.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
Reading a large book.	Gusoma igitabo kinini.
He didn't want to go after all.	Ntabwo yashakaga kugenda nyuma ya byose.
Maybe very soon.	Ahari vuba cyane.
Shame, but it's not.	Isoni, ariko sibyo.
Especially the hair, the hair.	Cyane cyane umusatsi, umusatsi.
No one can do anything.	Nta muntu ushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I'm glad he saw that on film	Nishimiye ko yabonye ibyo kuri firime
I had time for myself	Nari mfite umwanya kuri njye wenyine
I just know how beautiful you are.	Nzi neza gusa uko uri mwiza.
I was too young	Nanjye nari muto cyane
Very good thing	Ikintu cyiza cyane
.	.
From the first day.	Kuva ku munsi wa mbere.
He was young.	Yari muto.
It's a good thing for him.	Ni ikintu cyiza kuri yo.
I have never seen so many things	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ibintu byinshi
I have very little time.	Mfite igihe gito cyane.
It could be him.	Ushobora kuba we.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
Does anyone have an idea ?.	Umuntu wese afite igitekerezo?.
We had.	Twari dufite.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza kuri ibi.
Not one day, but in a short time.	Ntabwo ari umunsi umwe, ariko mugihe gito.
That was close, very close.	Ibyo byari hafi, hafi cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
And it worked.	Kandi byagenze neza.
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
I hadn't had a chance lately	Ntabwo nari nabonye umwanya vuba aha
You wouldn't know.	Ntabwo wari kumenya.
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
Nothing good, obviously.	Nta kintu cyiza, biragaragara.
I think that's hard	Ntekereza ko ibyo bigoye
But here, nothing.	Ariko hano, nta na kimwe.
That's good, and really.	Nibyiza, kandi rwose.
Today it is also ‘possible’.	Uyu munsi kandi 'birashoboka'.
He had no plans.	Nta gahunda yari afite.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
I had to wait	Nari nkwiye gutegereza
You know everyone.	Uzi abantu bose.
That was outside.	Ibyo byari hanze.
I am not a woman to him	Ntabwo ndi umugore kuri we
Or when, he can't figure it out.	Cyangwa igihe, ntashobora kumenya neza.
I had.	Nari mfite.
To go	Kugenda.
Everything in fact.	Ibintu byose mubyukuri.
I was not going to go back	Ntabwo nari ngiye gusubira inyuma
I know what you're going to say	Nzi icyo ugiye kuvuga
He went too high.	Yagiye hejuru cyane.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I can't do that	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora
I have a wife now	Mfite umugore wanjye ubu
I can't go back to work	Sinshobora gusubira ku kazi
This is a lot.	Ibi ni byinshi.
I think it's your age	Ntekereza ko ari imyaka yawe
Or for him.	Cyangwa kuri we.
I can't talk at all	Sinshobora kuvugana na gato
He was someone you had	Yari umuntu wari ufite
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
At the time, I had a bad idea	Icyo gihe nagize igitekerezo kibi
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Probably years.	Birashoboka imyaka.
I think he heard a lot of things	Ntekereza ko yumvise ibintu byinshi
I saw that in one movie	Nabonye ibyo muri firime rimwe
No one was present.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari ahari.
I never felt close.	Sinigeze numva ndi hafi.
I need to be with him	Nkeneye kubana na we
I need to know that it is not true	Nkeneye kumenya ko atari ukuri
And maybe the biggest thing is money.	Kandi birashoboka ko ikintu kinini ari amafaranga.
I am not my age.	Ntabwo mfite imyaka yanjye.
You don't work tomorrow.	Ntabwo ukora ejo.
A lot of good.	Byinshi byiza.
I need this most of all	Nkeneye ibi kuruta byose
I have a lot to go on, too	Mfite byinshi byo kugenda, nanjye
I think that's what we have to do.	Ntekereza ko aricyo tugomba gukora.
I can't be your wife	Sinshobora kuba umugore wawe
We had nothing.	Ntacyo twari dufite.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
In a short time, in fact	Igihe gito, mubyukuri
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
We can't imagine that.	Ntidushobora gutekereza ko aribyo.
The big one.	Kinini kinini.
But they know that there are people here.	Ariko bazi ko hano hari abantu.
He seemed speechless.	Yasaga naho adashobora kuvuga.
I have what I need.	Mfite ibyo nkeneye.
It was a lot of money at the time.	Icyo gihe yari amafaranga menshi.
I'm sure it is.	Nzi neza ko ari.
I am a very good boy.	Ndi umuhungu mwiza cyane.
But it is also up to him.	Ariko na we ni kuri we.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He was not alone.	Ntiyari wenyine.
Only he was not.	Gusa ntabwo yari arimo.

I wanted to leave	Nashakaga kuva aho
I was scared	Nari mfite ubwoba
No.	Nta.
He wanted everything.	Yashakaga byose.
So far, good.	Kugeza ubu, byiza.
I think it's really good	Ntekereza ko mubyukuri ari byiza
I knew exactly who he was	Nari nzi neza uwo ari we
I was not sure what to think about this	Sinari nzi neza icyo ntekereza kuri ibi
I work every day	Nkora buri munsi
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
My wife.	Umugore wanjye.
I was happy with that one	Nari nishimiye uwo
I haven't seen it recently.	Ntabwo nabonye vuba aha.
Eventually, something happened to him.	Amaherezo, hari ikintu yaje kuri we.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko bigoye gukora.
That was a lot.	Ibyo byari byinshi rwose.
I shouldn’t look	Ntabwo nkwiye kureba
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He has to say something.	Agomba kugira icyo avuga.
It's always great.	Buri gihe ni byiza cyane.
I don’t feel easy, to go	Ntabwo numva byoroshye, kugenda
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
I know nothing about myself	Ntacyo nzi kuri njye
I didn't know what to say	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo avuga
You can definitely do that.	Urashobora rwose kubikora.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
We need to know who he is.	Tugomba kumenya uwo ari we.
I haven't thought about it until recently	Ntabwo natekereje kuri byo kugeza vuba aha
He has now.	Ubu afite.
We have a house.	Dufite inzu.

Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko ni byiza.
I don't want money.	Sinshaka amafaranga.
Making friends.	Kugira inshuti.
I can't feel it there	Sinshobora kumva ko ahari
I have to think that this is very possible.	Nkwiye gutekereza ko ibyo bishoboka cyane.
I am drinking a lot.	Ndimo kunywa cyane.
It's great to be together	Nibyiza cyane kubana
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
'	'
I have a daughter	Mfite umukobwa wanjye

It's one thing to be good.	Ni ikintu kimwe kuba cyiza.

As if he were scared.	Nkaho afite ubwoba.
And good thing.	Kandi ikintu cyiza.

Obviously not the time.	Biragaragara ko atari cyo gihe.
And it was true.	Kandi byari ukuri.
I didn't know who to believe	Sinari nzi uwo nizera
It is not below ground.	Ntabwo ari munsi yo hasi.
Good idea, man.	Igitekerezo cyiza, umuntu.
If true, it didn't work out.	Niba ari ukuri, ntabwo byagenze neza.
I want everything.	Ndashaka byose.
It's good to go again.	Nibyiza kongera kugenda.
I can't believe he's gone	Sinshobora kwizera ko yagiye
I needed to read that this morning	Nari nkeneye gusoma ibyo muri iki gitondo
Everything went well	Ibintu byose byagenze neza
I need help, please.	Nkeneye ubufasha, nyamuneka.
I was in my thirties at the time.	Icyo gihe nari mfite imyaka mirongo itatu.
That's the whole point.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyose.
I work on one.	Nkora kuri umwe.
I am very happy	Nishimiye cyane
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I have bus money	Mfite amafaranga ya bisi
Here, it is simple and straightforward.	Hano, byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
I know it's not your fault	Nzi ko atari amakosa yawe
I'm really scared for the first time	Nukuri mfite ubwoba bwa mbere
It's all.	Ni byose.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I know he didn't mean anything	Nzi ko ntacyo yashakaga kuvuga
I don't think he tried anything	Ndakeka ko ntacyo yagerageje yigeze akora
I don't feel like doing this	Ntabwo numva nishimiye gukora ibi
I have to make a plan	Ngomba gukora gahunda
Especially a girl or a woman.	Cyane cyane umukobwa cyangwa umugore.
I need to get out of here	Nkeneye kuva hano
Very young girl	Umukobwa muto cyane
And they were friends.	Kandi bari inshuti.
He had to think carefully.	Yagombaga gutekereza neza.
If he does not.	Niba atabikoze.
He wanted to hear nothing.	Yashakaga ko ntacyo yumva.
We are scared, the children are scared.	Dufite ubwoba, abana bafite ubwoba.
I only have this one	Mfite iyi gusa
He was a morning man.	Yari umuntu wo mu gitondo.
Most of all.	Byinshi muri byose.
I saw him and he felt something	Nabonye nawe yumva ikintu
I can't think of anything like that	Sinshobora gutekereza gutya
As he did.	Nkuko yabikoze.
I had a plan.	Nari mfite gahunda.
Money a woman doesn't know.	Amafaranga umugore atazi.
None of us did.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wabikoze.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Everything was fine.	Ibintu byose byari byiza.
I can't really say.	Sinshobora kuvuga rwose.
I had nothing.	Nta na kimwe nari mfite.
I really hope you can.	Ndizera rwose ko ushobora.
That's all there is to it	Ibintu byose nibyo
Reading, reading, reading.	Gusoma, gusoma, gusoma.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
I was a very young child.	Nari umwana muto cyane.
He didn't want to go home.	Ntiyashakaga gutaha.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
I can't take anything else	Sinshobora gufata ikindi
I thought I was the only one.	Natekereje ko ari njye wenyine.
But that's all.	Ariko ni byose.
That's what he did.	Nibyo yakoze.
I think you have to do it.	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kubikora.

Like later.	Nka nyuma.
Nor was it true.	Ntabwo kandi byari ukuri.
He was in front of her.	Yari imbere ye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we atabikoze.
You are a young man.	Uri umusore.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
Today, the party was not an occasion for me	Uyu munsi, ibirori ntabwo byari umwanya kuri njye
But apparently he did not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atabikoze.
I didn’t want to carry too much	Sinifuzaga gutwara byinshi
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I have to help with this	Ngomba gufasha ibi
And they have the truth.	Kandi bafite ukuri.
He was very good at it.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri byo.
There are many of them.	Hariho byinshi muri byo.
I don't want help.	Sinshaka ubufasha.
I didn’t think it was possible	Sinatekerezaga ko bishoboka
No questions asked.	Nta kibazo yabajije.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
I am not one of these.	Ntabwo ndi muri aba.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
I wanted to do it	Nashakaga kubikora
Maybe even in the morning.	Ahari no mu gitondo.
I know you have something	Nzi ko ufite ikintu
I think you should talk to him	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kuvugana nawe
I didn’t want him to go	Sinifuzaga ko agenda
It's a really good phone.	Ni terefone nziza rwose.
You were a child.	Wari umwana.
With	Hamwe na.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
I know it's not his fault	Nzi ko atari amakosa ye
How to think positively.	Uburyo bwo gutekereza neza.
To do so.	Kubikora.
I don’t know what, exactly.	Sinzi icyo, neza.
Too big for one.	Kinini cyane kuri kimwe.
It was your first day.	Wari umunsi wawe wa mbere.
I don't want to say that.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga ibyo.
I never saw it there	Sinigeze mbona ko ahari
Good to see.	Nibyiza kureba.
There is a plan here, but for no reason.	Hano hari gahunda, ariko nta mpamvu.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
I mean right now	Ndashaka kuvuga kuri ubu
I ask anything	Ndabaza icyo aricyo cyose
But you are talking to a bad person.	Ariko urimo kuvugana numuntu mubi.
He would have gone.	Yaba yagiye.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo.
Tomorrow would be great.	Ejo byaba byiza cyane.
I think it's really good	Ntekereza ko ari byiza rwose
You can't find a good guy.	Ntushobora kubona umusore mwiza.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
I just wanted to	Nashakaga gusa
Man, that would be great.	Umuntu, byaba byiza.
He asked for help on his own.	Yasabye ubufasha wenyine.
I was not a friend	Ntabwo nari umuntu wo gusaba inshuti
I like to be away	Nkunda kuba kure
I had nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari mfite
We needed to know.	Twari dukeneye kumenya.
I don't want to go.	Ntashaka kugenda.
I did nothing good here.	Nta cyiza nakoze hano.
Not everything went well.	Ntabwo ibintu byose byagenze neza.
This is it.	Ubu ni bwo.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
He tried his father's family.	Yagerageje umuryango wa se.
He was finally here.	Amaherezo yari hano.
He wants to do it	Ashaka kubikora
I can't do it right.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora neza.
As it is difficult to say much.	Nkuko bigoye kuvuga byinshi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
I would do nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari gukora
Just one question.	Ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I think he knew it was me	Ntekereza ko yamenye ko ari njye
I was not lucky	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe
If there was a movie, it was there.	Niba hari firime, yari ahari.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko twari abantu benshi.
He was a bad boy.	Yari umuhungu mubi.
I'm sure today.	Nzi neza ko uyu munsi.
I'm not happy	Ntabwo nishimiye
I can do one or the other.	Nshobora gukora kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
I needed to stop this	Nari nkeneye guhagarika ibi
He knew in that look that he had problems.	Yari azi ko uwo munsi afite ibibazo.
I was looking for a dog to look at.	Nashakaga imbwa yo kureba.
If he had anything.	Niba hari icyo yari afite.
You can read his comment on this issue here.	Urashobora gusoma igitekerezo cye kuri iki kibazo hano.
I needed help	Nari nkeneye ubufasha
We have a lot to learn.	Dufite byinshi byo kwiga.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
It would never have happened again.	Ntabwo byari kubaho ikindi gihe.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I didn’t think he could do it	Sinatekerezaga ko ashobora kubikora
He said they had.	Yavuze ko bari bafite.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I can't think of going home	Sinshobora gutekereza gutaha
And that is something else.	Kandi icyo ni ikindi kintu.
I didn't know things	Sinari nzi ibintu
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
I love children	Nkunda cyane abana
I can't stand him	Sinshobora imbere ye
This meeting did badly.	Iyi nama yakoze nabi.
It was true.	Nukuri byari ukuri.
You alone, and you know what you know.	Wowe wenyine, kandi uzi ibyo uzi.
We were so many kids.	Twari abana benshi cyane.
We really are not.	Ntabwo rwose turi.
It's not a good day for me.	Ntabwo ari umunsi mwiza kuri njye.
I never saw that.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo.
I was going to play this best as much as possible	Nari ngiye gukina ibi byiza cyane bishoboka
As you should.	Nkuko ugomba.
All in all, this is it.	Byose, iyi ni.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
I am working.	Ndimo nkora akazi.
I have to think that this is normal	Nkwiye gutekereza ko ibyo ari ibintu bisanzwe
I do not mean.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga.
And that's exactly what we have to say.	Kandi ibi nibyo tugomba kuvuga.
I know what he is saying	Nzi ibyo avuga
He did well for me.	Yakoze neza kuri njye.
No one can see anything.	Nta muntu ushobora kubona ikintu.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
We were close.	Twari hafi.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
I didn’t like it very much, in fact	Sinigeze nkunda cyane, mubyukuri
I feel baby.	Numva umwana.
You don't have to go with it.	Ntugomba kujyana.
I was lucky enough to be there	Nagize amahirwe yari ahari
That's not true.	Icyo atari cyo.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
My favorite, in fact.	Nkunda cyane, mubyukuri.
I didn't see it at the time.	Icyo gihe sinigeze mbona.
You have to do it	Ugomba kubikora
I have to go home now	Ngomba gutaha ubu
I needed to know why he was gone	Nari nkeneye kumenya impamvu yagiye
It was something to look forward to.	Byari ikintu cyo gutegereza.
I told you everything.	Nabwiye byose.
That would work.	Ibyo byari gukora.
I knew nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi
I thought it was great	Natekereje ko ari byiza cyane
I needed something to live on	Nari nkeneye ikintu cyo kubaho
He was ready to go.	Yari yiteguye kugenda.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
And you know that's true.	Kandi uzi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
It is not wise.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge.
I never heard him speak	Sinigeze numva ibyo avuga
I quickly realized something was wrong with me	Nabonye vuba vuba ikintu kuri njye
You have an idea.	Ufite igitekerezo.
It would be easy.	Byaba byoroshye.
And so do we.	Kandi natwe kuri twe.
I wanted to know who he was	Nashakaga kumenya uwo ari we
That's right, a lot.	Nibyo, byinshi.
I want to be with you tonight	Ndashaka kubana nawe muri iri joro
I was a young child	Nari umwana muto
He thought that.	Yatekereje ko.
I had something to do	Nari mfite icyo gukora
I want to be close to you	Ndashaka kuba hafi yawe
That will be very soon.	Ibyo bizaba vuba cyane.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
No one had seen it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari wabonye.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza mubyukuri nibyo.
I can hear something else	Nshobora kumva ikindi kintu
If he is, that's fine.	Niba arimo, nibyiza.
I know exactly what to do	Nzi neza icyo gukora
They are in us.	Bari muri twe.
I want to know where you are	Ndashaka kumenya neza aho uri
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byoroshye.

One can help with this.	Umuntu ashobora gufasha muri ibi.
You know what you want.	Uzi icyo ushaka.
It's good to be the right person.	Nibyiza kuba umuntu ukwiye.
But he did not do much.	Ariko nta byinshi yakoze.
I love everything	Nkunda buri kintu cyose
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
He went to try.	Yagiye kugerageza.
No one needed to tell me that.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ukeneye kumbwira ibyo.
I am three years old	Mfite imyaka itatu
He knows what he knows.	Azi ibyo azi.
I knew it was my fault	Nari nzi ko ari amakosa yanjye
I didn’t think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga cyane
I was close	Nari hafi
I found it easy enough	Nabonye byoroshye bihagije
You have to be better than one guy.	Ugomba kuba mwiza kurenza umusore umwe.
It wasn't that good.	Ntabwo ari uko byari byiza.
I could never figure out what that thing was	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kumenya icyo kintu icyo aricyo
I thought he should get more out of me.	Natekerezaga ko agomba kubona byinshi kuri njye.
Not only that.	Ntabwo ari gusa.
A short time.	Igihe gito.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
I thought it was all.	Natekereje ko ari byose.
But it was so beautiful.	Ariko yari mwiza cyane.
He’s very young, but he’s also a player.	Ari muto cyane, ariko kandi ni umukinnyi.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
It was normal	Byari bisanzwe
It’s a family for him.	Ni umuryango kuri we.
I don't know what happened	Sinzi uko byagenze
I think maybe it's possible.	Ntekereza ko ahari bishoboka.
Well, we have to do it.	Nibyo, tugomba kubikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
I have time to think	Mfite umwanya wo gutekereza
It's not that hard.	Ntabwo rwose bigoye.
So far that is possible.	Kugeza ubu ibyo birashoboka.
If anything he does.	Niba hari icyo akora rwose.
It was easy for me.	Byari byoroshye kuri njye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
No one can tell me again.	Nta muntu ushobora kongera kumbwira.
I need time alone	Nkeneye umwanya wenyine
I want to go	Ndashaka kugenda
One was a boy.	Umwe yari umuhungu.
You want to be in that house.	Urashaka kuba muri iyo nzu.
You know nothing, but you know you know nothing.	Ntacyo uzi, ariko uzi ko ntacyo uzi.
This is not a problem.	Ibi ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I really wasn't a good person	Nukuri sinari umuntu mwiza
He did not know if it was true.	Ntiyari azi niba aribyo.
I didn't see the time or the person who left.	Ntabwo nabonye igihe cyangwa uwo yagiye.
Call a friend.	Terefone inshuti.
I would hear something	Nari kumva ikintu
I was, really.	Nari, rwose.
It is now.	Ubu ni.
This is the last thing you see.	Niki kintu cya nyuma wabonye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I have all the problems	Mfite ibibazo byose
He had very little time.	Yari afite umwanya muto cyane.
It was as if.	Byari nkaho.
I shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora.
I think he has to be good	Ndatekereza ko agomba kuba mwiza
You can stop cookies.	Urashobora guhagarika kuki.
Everything will be fine.	Ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
I hope you have a plan	Nizera ko ufite gahunda
The boy is gone.	Umuhungu yagiye.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
This is my friend.	Iyi ni inshuti yanjye.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
I wanted to know more.	Nashakaga kumenya neza.
The woman said she couldn't.	Umugore yavuze ko adashobora.
I hope you like it.	Nizere ko ukunda.
He thought of her	Yatekereje kuri we
There is my family.	Hariho umuryango wanjye.
Not good for me.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
After all, a quick look is what we needed.	Nyuma ya byose, kureba vuba ni byo twari dukeneye.
No job.	Nta kazi.
I can't think	Sinshobora gutekereza
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
I knew it was too easy	Nari nzi ko byoroshye cyane
And let it be.	Kandi reka.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
It was easy to see.	Byari byoroshye kubona.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
What he wanted.	Icyo yashakaga.
In fact, we can't.	Mubyukuri, ntidushobora.
I saw the floor in him, inside front	Nabonye hasi muri we, imbere imbere
He wants more.	Arashaka byinshi.
I'm not far from you	Ntabwo ndi kure yawe
But he seemed to be gone.	Ariko yasaga nkaho yagiye.
This alone is not good enough.	Ibi gusa ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
I had no money or friends	Ntabwo nari mfite amafaranga cyangwa inshuti
There is so much to see.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona.
These are the people with the problem.	Aba ni abantu bafite ikibazo.
He thought about what to do.	Yatekereje icyo gukora.
I don't know what you are.	Sinzi icyo uri cyo.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
It was just an idea.	Byari igitekerezo gusa.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
Just for me.	Gusa kuri njye.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
He doesn't feel right.	Ntabwo yumva ari ukuri.
It was good to wait.	Byari byiza gutegereza.
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
Today, we all have a lot.	Uyu munsi, twese dufite byinshi.
He did something.	Hari icyo yakoze.
You can't say.	Ntushobora kuvuga.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
It was very close	Byari hafi cyane
However, she is a young child and is her teacher.	Ariko, ni umwana muto kandi uri umwarimu we.
There is nothing to eat here.	Nta kintu cyo kurya hano.
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
I heard what happened	Numvise uko byagenze
A little, really	Ikintu gito, mubyukuri
And this is absolutely true.	Kandi ibi rwose ni ukuri.
He knew he had it.	Yari azi ko afite.
I think there is someone for everyone	Ntekereza ko hari umuntu kuri bose
I think it's great.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza cyane.
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
He has it all.	Afite byose.
I guess we should drink later	Ndakeka ko tugomba kunywa nyuma
I mean this	Ndashaka kuvuga ibi
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It wasn't normal like me.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe nkanjye.
We.	Ni.
It is very likely that his father.	Birashoboka cyane ko se.
Take a little work, too.	Gufata akazi gato, kandi.
Me too.	Nanjye.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
It is not a chance.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe.
Dogs too.	Imbwa na yo.
I was sure he was	Nari nzi neza ko ari we
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
For everyone.	Kuri buri wese.
Find out if he was home.	Kumenya niba yari murugo.
It's hard to play.	Kuba bigoye gukina.
I really want to say this	Ndashaka kuvuga ibi rwose
I think he is right.	Ndakeka ko afite ukuri.
But they were here.	Ariko bari hano.
He was not ready at all.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye na gato.
They were both very close	Bombi bari hafi cyane
We are scared and we have to be scared.	Dufite ubwoba kandi tugomba kugira ubwoba.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
I thought it was really good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza rwose.
I want to be there.	Ndashaka kuba ahari.
He is ready to take.	Yiteguye gufata.
But none of that now.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ubu.
And you don’t have to.	Kandi ntugomba.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko ahari.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko.
I like to talk sometimes	Nkunda kuvuga rimwe na rimwe
I am a boy.	Ndi umuhungu.
In all things.	Muri byose.
Now, he is not sure why.	Ubu, ntabwo azi neza impamvu yabikoze.
I had something else to know first	Nari mfite ikindi kintu cyo kumenya mbere
I feel we have too.	Ndumva natwe dufite.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
If you want.	Niba ushaka.
I can do a good job	Nshobora gutsinda akazi neza
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
You want to be alone.	Ushaka kuba wenyine.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
It was you.	Wari wowe.
I love the whole family.	Nkunda umuryango wose.
Or maybe it's not him.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari we.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I don't want to know.	Sinshaka kumenya.
And not just me.	Kandi si njye gusa.
I'm not sure if that's the case or not.	Sinzi neza niba aricyo kibazo cyangwa atari cyo.
Nothing to hear.	Nta kintu cyo kumva.
I was sure that	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo
I feel like a family	Ndumva turi umuryango
Young man	Umusore muto.
As we have.	Nkuko dufite.
And who he was.	Kandi uwo yari we.
He was behind.	Yari inyuma.
And he was there.	Kandi yari ahari.
I never saw your car	Sinigeze mbona imodoka yawe
He thought he was for her too.	Yatekereje ko na we kuri we.
I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.	Sinzi neza niba aricyo kintu kibi.
I had no job.	Nta kazi nari mfite.
He did not want to see his family again.	Ntiyashakaga kongera kubona umuryango we.
It was too young to learn, to understand exactly what he wanted.	Byari muto cyane kwiga, kumva neza icyo ashaka.
All he had was, in fact, time.	Ibyo yari afite byose, mubyukuri, byari igihe.
He can do it inside.	Arashobora kubikora imbere.
Not much to do.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo gukora.
I just have to find something	Ngomba gusa kubona ikintu
I want to work again	Ndashaka kongera gukora
I think this is good.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza.
He must believe.	Agomba kwizera.
Now I know that none of this is true	Ubu nzi ko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri
I was the one he wanted	Nari uwo yashakaga
I have to go back down	Ngomba gusubira hasi
There is one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe.
He felt he had made a mistake.	Yumvise ko yakoze amakosa.
It is not a normal food.	Ntabwo ari ibiryo bisanzwe.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I need to stay late	Nkeneye kuguma nyuma
We have to find food.	Tugomba gushaka ibiryo.
He’s not a bad person, really.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mubi, mubyukuri.
I want to stop things sometimes.	Ndashaka guhagarika ibintu rimwe na rimwe.
I feel like you want to do something good	Ndumva ushaka gukora ikintu cyiza
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
I need each of them.	Nkeneye buri kimwe muri byo.
This was good for me	Ibi byari byiza kuri njye
I didn't know why	Sinari nzi impamvu yabikoze
What you may or may not want.	Ibyo ushobora cyangwa udashaka.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
'	'
He probably needs money.	Birashoboka ko akeneye amafaranga.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
I'm not sure.	Sinzi neza neza.
I felt good and well	Numvise neza kandi neza
I had a drinking problem	Nagize ikibazo cyo kunywa
I shouldn't be around you	Ntabwo nkwiye kuba hafi yawe
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi uko ashobora gufasha.
I didn't know what to say	Sinari nzi icyo avuga
.	.
What are you doing here for a long time? 	Niki ukora hano igihe kirekire?
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekereje cyane
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Let the boy.	Reka umuhungu.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I was here all the time	Nari hano igihe cyose
I don't want to do anything else.	Sinshaka gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
He thinks that's the problem.	Yibwira ko icyo ari cyo kibazo.
I think he meant it	Ndatekereza ko yashakaga kuvuga
I can do something good	Nshobora gukora ikintu cyiza
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari birashoboka.
I feel it all the time	Ndumva buri gihe
He asked if there was anything he could do.	Yabajije niba hari ibyo ashobora kugira.
'	'
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
I knew exactly what it was	Nari nzi hafi icyo aricyo
Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
I am a very handsome young man	Ndi umusore mwiza cyane
Women, women, women.	Akazi, akazi, akazi.
You want	Urashaka.
The only chance.	Amahirwe wenyine.
I'm doing it now	Ndimo kubikora ubu
I wasn't going to do it	Ntabwo nari ngiye kubikora
You have to get it.	Ugomba kubona.
He used to talk to her.	Yakundaga kuvugana na we.
But no one can know everything.	Ariko nta muntu ushobora kumenya byose.
You are far from him.	Uri kure ye.
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kugira ibyo.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I didn't know anyone	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nzi
It was true.	Byari kuri.
I need to work.	Nkeneye gukora.
I haven't seen any of them since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona na kimwe muri byo
This is a good thing.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza.
I can't live like that	Sinshobora kubaho gutya
But he saw nothing, no one.	Ariko nta kintu yabonye, ​​nta muntu.
Eating down.	Kurya hasi.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane nibyo
We have a lot to do.	Dufite byinshi byo gukora.
I thought	Natekerezaga
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
To him and to him.	Kuri we no kuri we.
He knew a lot.	Yari azi byinshi.
He is upstairs.	We hejuru.
Everything.	Byose.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu byoroshye.
Tell me this is possible.	Mbwira ibi birashoboka.
I understand why he did it	Ndumva impamvu yabikoze
I'm not sure why	Sinzi neza impamvu
I had none of that	Nta na kimwe muri byo nari mfite
I believe this or that	Ndizera ibi cyangwa ibi
There is so much to do	Hariho byinshi byo gukora
Maybe that would be better for us.	Ahari ibyo byaba byiza kuri twe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni byiza kuri ibyo.
He may have been gone for a while.	Birashoboka ko yari yagiye igihe gito.
He used to work.	Yakundaga gukora.
I need time alone	Nkeneye umwanya wenyine
You know you like to work.	Uzi ko ukunda gukora.
Your child is gone.	Umwana wawe yagiye.
Walking is another big thing.	Kugenda ni ikindi kintu kinini kimwe.
But you know how smart he is.	Ariko uzi uburyo afite ubwenge.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I think it's possible.	Ntekereza ko bishoboka.
The job he loved and was good for	Akazi yakundaga kandi yari mwiza kuri
He hadn't thought about what he would do once he got here.	Ntabwo yari yatekereje kubyo yari gukora amaze kuba hano.
I should have known better	Nari nkwiye kumenya neza
He is doing very well, he is very good.	Arimo akora neza cyane, ni mwiza cyane.
I don't know what to say	Sinzi icyo avuga
It's not down.	Ntabwo ari hasi.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
I just didn’t want to	Gusa sinigeze nshaka
I can identify with you	Nshobora kumenya nawe
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I felt bad.	Numvise nabi.
He loved to drive.	Yakundaga gutwara.
Everything looks the same.	Ibintu byose birasa.
A woman is close, but not close enough	Umugore hafi, ariko ntabwo ari hafi bihagije
Anyway.	Icyo ari cyo cyose.
This is a great time.	Uyu ni umwanya mwiza cyane.
Only one time.	Igihe kimwe gusa.
I didn't know it was long	Sinari nzi ko ari kirekire
But what she really wanted was a girl.	Ariko icyo yashakaga rwose ni umukobwa.
I really need to stop doing this.	Nkeneye rwose guhagarika gukora ibi.
He didn't think of anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yatekerezaga.
That is certainly possible with the plan ahead.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose hamwe na gahunda iri imbere.
There is.	Hariho.
Let's go upstairs.	Ni hejuru.
I have to work now	Ngomba gukora ubu
I can't come now, not today	Sinshobora kuza nonaha, ntabwo uyu munsi
I can come every day	Nshobora kuza buri munsi
I'm going to go	Ngiye kujyana
And you can see why.	Kandi urashobora kubona impamvu.
It's good to read.	Nibyiza gusoma.
I was not happy at the time	Ntabwo nari nishimiye neza icyo gihe
But you are the only one who can have it.	Ariko ni wowe wenyine ushobora kugira.
He was sitting.	Yari yicaye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo yagombaga gukora.
Any ideas to do here.	Igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose gukora hano.
I work every day.	Nkora buri munsi.
It was his fault just like him.	Byari amakosa ye kimwe na we.
I'm glad that is the case.	Nishimiye niba aribyo.
However, that is not the case.	Icyo ariko, ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
I guess he was right	Ndakeka ko yari afite ukuri
I can't be either	Nanjye sinshobora kuba
He is not thirty years old.	Ntabwo afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
Any of these.	Icyo ari cyo cyose muri ibi.
He says he is looking for a job.	Avuga ko ashaka akazi.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
I need to know more about him	Nkeneye kumenya byinshi kuri we
Wouldn't that be great?!.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose byaba byiza?!.
I really like this movie	Nkunda iyi firime rwose
I need to tell someone, just once.	Nkeneye kubwira umuntu, rimwe gusa.
I'm not a guy.	Ntabwo ndi umusore.
I just thought you should know the truth	Gusa natekereje ko ugomba kumenya ukuri
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I guess that's what he was good at.	Ndakeka ko aribyo yari umuhanga.
One thing here.	Ikintu kimwe hano.
He didn’t have to wait long.	Ntabwo yagombaga gutegereza igihe kirekire.
I think you needed me to understand	Ntekereza ko wari ukeneye ko numva
I can't buy that	Ntabwo nshobora kugura ibyo
I didn't need much talent	Ntabwo nari nkeneye impano nyinshi
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kibi kuri we.
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
Something I heard	Hari ikintu numvise
I shouldn't have gotten a job	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubona akazi
I feel fortunate to be here	Ndumva mfite amahirwe yo kuba hano
I know what he thinks	Nzi icyo atekereza

But we are also human.	Ariko natwe turi abantu.
I have enough of that	Mfite ibyo bihagije
I mean, that's not a problem	Ndashaka kuvuga ko atari ikibazo
He is going to be very bad.	Agiye kuba mubi cyane.
I don't think he saw it.	Ntabwo mbona ko yabonye.
I don't know if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi niba aribyo.
I was a good guy.	Nari umusore mwiza.
He said he was happy to help.	Yavuze ko yishimiye gufasha.
I didn't know much about him	Ntabwo nari nzi byinshi kuri we
It is very good and very good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza cyane.
I can't wait to quit my job	Sinshobora gutegereza kureka akazi
Well if you don't want to tell me why.	Nibyiza niba udashaka kumbwira impamvu.
You can do it now.	Urashobora kubikora ubu.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi bishoboka.
I want to be friends	Ndashaka kuba inshuti
Or just.	Cyangwa gusa.
He came alone.	Yaje wenyine.
I have a lot to think about	Mfite byinshi byo gutekereza
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I don’t just believe what he says.	Ntabwo nizera gusa ibyo avuga.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
He had to do it.	Yagombaga kubikora.
Everyone was scared.	Abantu bose bari bafite ubwoba.
I did exactly what he told me to do	Nakoze neza ibyo yambwiye gukora
Day trips.	Gutwara umunsi.
Just no one to talk to.	Gusa nta muntu wo kuvugana.
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I know what you mean	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
I can see everyone	Nshobora kureba abantu bose
I need advice.	Nkeneye inama.

I thought a lot about this.	Natekereje cyane kuri ibi.
For me.	Kuri njye.

But they know how to help.	Ariko bazi neza ubufasha.
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda
I'm not sure why	Ntabwo nzi neza impamvu
He did not want to be intimidated.	Ntiyashakaga ko agira ubwoba.

But it’s probably not too much.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari byinshi cyane.
I hope so too.	Ndizera ko na we ari.

What we can do.	Ibyo dushobora gukora.
This was his father.	Uyu yari se.
I think that's a good idea	Ntekereza ko ari igitekerezo cyiza
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
It was easy	Byari ibintu byoroshye
I just have to see things	Ngomba kuba mbona ibintu gusa
I can't live with that	Sinshobora kubana nibyo
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko byari byiza
If not my son.	Niba atari umuhungu wanjye.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
I shouldn’t have done that	Sinari nkwiye kubikora
He thought he was young.	Yatekereje ko yari akiri muto.
I got to think.	Nabonye gutekereza.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
That he needed help.	Ko yari akeneye ubufasha.
This is probably not what you want.	Ibi birashoboka ko atari byo ushaka.
I have to have a reason.	Ngomba kugira impamvu.
I can't do that	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora
I saw his family.	Nabonye umuryango we.
I feel that way.	Ndumva aribyo.
He has to take his time.	Agomba gufata igihe cye.
I can't say what it is	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo aricyo
But I have a short time to live.	Mfite ariko igihe gito cyo kubaho.
That would be normal.	Ibyo byaba ari ibintu bisanzwe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari ibibazo.
I am you, and you are me	Ndi wowe, kandi uri njye
But that is the same thing.	Ariko icyo ni ikintu kimwe.
I was just scared this morning	Gusa nagize ubwoba muri iki gitondo
First of all, there are clothes.	Mbere na mbere, hari imyenda.
But for one thing.	Ariko ku kintu kimwe.
You know we can do that.	Uzi ko dushobora kubikora.
I love food and eating out	Nkunda ibiryo no kurya hanze
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Biragaragara, ntabwo ari uko bisanzwe.
I'm just a person.	Ndi umuntu gusa.
I was beautiful too.	Nanjye nari mwiza.
It was then that he came to think.	Icyo gihe yari yaje gutekereza.
I didn't know all this	Sinari nzi ibi byose
I'm not sure what that is.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo aricyo.
I can do what you do	Nshobora gukora ibyo ukora
I was never able to walk	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kugenda
He also needed to do it.	Na we yari akeneye kubikora.
Being her father's daughter.	Kuba umukobwa wa se.
I think that would be it	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari kuba
He knew he was scared.	Yari azi ko afite ubwoba.
I know what it is.	Nzi icyo aricyo.
I was scared	Nagize ubwoba
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He knew exactly what he was thinking.	Yari azi neza icyo yatekerezaga.
For him only one thing.	Kuri we ikintu kimwe gusa.
You just didn't do it.	Ntabwo wabikoze gusa.
I just can't do it.	Gusa ntashobora gukora.
I don't need anything for him.	Ntacyo nkeneye kuri we.
I never heard him speak	Sinigeze numva ibyo avuga
I see it as a gift	Mbona ko ari impano
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
My luck.	Amahirwe yanjye.
I want him to say a lot	Ndashaka ko avuga byinshi
I can't think of anything worse	Sinshobora gutekereza ku kintu kimwe kibi
But he didn't look.	Ariko ntabwo yasaga.
We have to do it again	Tugomba kongera kubikora
I can't believe you were my teacher	Sinshobora kwizera ko wari umwarimu wanjye
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi neza ko aribyo yari afite.
There is work here.	Hano hari akazi.
He is.	Ni we.
However, you must always look for the best player.	Ariko, ugomba gushaka umukinnyi mwiza buri gihe.
I knew this	Nari nzi ibi
I need to get out of this room	Nkeneye kuva muri iki cyumba
I need to go	Nkeneye kujyana
I feel nothing for him.	Ntacyo numva kuri we.
It's easy to get away.	Byoroshye kure.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
I have nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe mfite
I see.	Njye mbona.
I need time to plan	Nkeneye igihe cyo gukora gahunda
Not the same thing.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu kimwe.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza rwose.
One time.	Umwanya umwe.
And it really is.	Kandi biragaragara rwose.
Money is very possible.	Amafaranga birashoboka cyane.
I should be lucky	Nkwiye kugira amahirwe
I feel the same way, like me	Ndumva ari kimwe, nkanjye
I have to get out of here	Ngomba kuva hano
Today is your day.	Uyu munsi ni umunsi wawe.
We were close.	Twari hafi.
And that's probably the case.	Kandi birashoboka ko aribyo.
I'm sure that is the case.	Nzi neza ko kuri iyo.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
But there is more to driving than that.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo gutwara kuruta ibyo.
I was scared to leave	Nagize ubwoba bwo kugenda
You have seen good things.	Wabonye ibintu byiza.
I didn’t have time to think	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo gutekereza
What he meant.	Icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
But it is my family.	Ariko ni umuryango wanjye.
I can do nothing here.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora hano.
None of us can.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ushobora.
I did something about it then	Icyo gihe hari icyo nakoze
That's exactly what he wants to do.	Nibyo rwose ashaka gukora.
I haven't told anyone yet	Nta muntu n'umwe nabwiye kugeza ubu
I'm lucky he didn't.	Mfite amahirwe ko atabikoze.
Looks like it's easy.	Birasa nkaho byoroshye.
I have made good friends	Nabonye inshuti nziza
I think he knew it was that day.	Ntekereza ko yari azi ko ari uwo munsi.
I'm upstairs.	Ndi hejuru.
I didn't want to.	Ntabwo nashakaga.

Today was the day.	Uyu munsi wari umunsi.
I wanted to do it	Nashakaga kubikora
It was a privilege.	Byari amahirwe.
It’s not a matter of winning.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo cyo gutsinda.
I was looking for a job	Nashakaga akazi
I don't know if it will be tonight.	Sinzi niba bizaba iri joro.
I didn’t have time to think.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo gutekereza.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
Time is money.	Igihe ni amafaranga.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I can do that before	Nshobora kubikora mbere
I hear it sometimes.	Ndumva rimwe na rimwe.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I haven't seen it since.	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona.
Most are good.	Byinshi ni byiza.
I need something, man	Nkeneye ikintu, muntu
I like to take time.	Nkunda gufata igihe.
I need to know more	Ngomba kumenya byinshi
I can't eat again.	Ntabwo nshobora kongera kurya.
Then and there.	Icyo gihe na hano.
He must know his place.	Agomba kumenya umwanya we.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
I just didn't know what was going on	Gusa sinari nzi neza uko byagenze
You can't think for yourself.	Ntushobora gutekereza wenyine.
I knew it was possible	Nari nzi ko bishoboka
He must have help.	Agomba kugira ubufasha.
I needed a little time.	Nari nkeneye igihe gito.
He realized that he did not know what to say.	Yabonye ko atazi icyo avuga.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
Fast is good.	Vuba ni byiza.
I know this is the right guy	Nzi ko uyu ari umusore ukwiye
I always see everything	Buri gihe mbona byose
I need money.	Nkeneye amafaranga.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I didn't want to live	Sinifuzaga kubaho
I thought that was a good thing	Natekereje ko aricyo kintu cyiza
As if it were true.	Nkaho byari ukuri.
I was very worried	Nagize impungenge cyane
I don't know now.	Sinzi ubu.
I can't get out of here	Ntabwo nshobora kuva hano
I think it would be nice to buy from me.	Ntekereza ko byari byiza kugura kuri njye.
He thought he needed a plan.	Yatekereje ko yari akeneye gahunda.
I didn’t want him to be alone	Sinifuzaga ko aba wenyine
Who is behind him?	Ninde uri inyuma ye.
Only in a short time, however.	Gusa mu gihe gito, ariko.
I think you have to do it	Ntekereza ko ugomba kubikora
It was not too early for him.	Ntabwo byari kare kuri we.
I want to be close to you	Ndashaka kuba hafi yawe
Yes, everything was fine.	Nibyo, ibintu byose byari byiza.
I think you should be alone	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kuba wenyine
We just have to see.	Tugomba kubona gusa.
He should have stayed.	Yari akwiye kuguma.
I want to be here with you	Ndashaka kuba hano hamwe nawe
No one knows.	Ntabwo ari uwo uzi.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
Of course, he knew what he was up to.	Nibyo, yari azi icyo arimo.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
You have to do this.	Ugomba gukora ibi.
There is only now.	Hariho ubu gusa.
I never heard of a problem	Sinigeze numva ikibazo
There is nothing we can do about it right now.	Ntacyo dushobora gukora kuri ubu.
But he never worried.	Ariko ntiyigeze agira impungenge.
I am a family man	Ndi umuntu wo murugo
But he wants more.	Ariko arashaka byinshi.
I had a lot of questions about all this	Nari mfite ibibazo byinshi kuri ibi byose
I think he wanted to	Ntekereza ko yashakaga
I thought about this a lot.	Natekereje kuri ibi byinshi.
I never felt human	Sinigeze numva ko ndi umuntu
He watched with the film.	Yarebye hamwe na firime.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri yo.
Everyone.	Abantu bose.
I wanted to know	Nashakaga kumenya
You really know better.	Mubyukuri uzi neza.
And it will be normal.	Kandi bizaba bisanzwe.
And that's fine.	Kandi nibyiza.
And you can do it at home.	Kandi urashobora kubikora murugo.
He had not gone to work this week and was not in his home.	Muri iki cyumweru ntabwo yari yagiye ku kazi kandi ntabwo yari mu nzu ye.
I don't know where he is.	Ntabwo nzi aho ari.
I really need to go home	Nkeneye rwose gutaha
It was much harder than that.	Byari bigoye cyane kurenza ibyo.
I can do things again	Nshobora kongera gukora ibintu
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
I didn't see anyone	Nta muntu nabonye
It would not be a concern here.	Ntabwo byari kuba impungenge hano.
I think this is all	Ntekereza ko ibi aribyo byose
I have another problem.	Mfite ikindi kibazo.
I knew it too.	Nanjye nari nzi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I want to leave this house	Ndashaka kuva muri iyi nzu
I need to know what you're going to do	Nkeneye kumenya icyo ugiye gukora
For me, this was too much.	Kuri njye, ibi byari byinshi cyane.
But you can't be both.	Ariko ntushobora kuba bombi.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I really deserve it	Nkwiye rwose
Just a child, a boy.	Gusa umwana, umuhungu.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
I wanted to go home	Nashakaga gutaha
I'm here but for a while	Ndi hano ariko mugihe gito
You have a lot to live for.	Ufite byinshi byo kubaho.
I understand what you need	Ndumva ibyo ukeneye
And who.	Kandi uwo.
One time.	Umwanya umwe.
Very bad thing	Ikintu kibi cyane
I did not know this.	Ntabwo nari nzi ibi.
He did something.	Hari icyo yakoze.
I never told anyone.	Nta muntu nigeze mbwira.
I can't come that way.	Sinshobora kuza gutya.
But that was before.	Ariko ibyo byari mbere.
I was not sure what to believe	Sinari nzi neza icyo nizera
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He was that.	Yari uwo.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
That's right.	Nukuri.
I have a plan	Mfite gahunda yo hejuru
I have to do something.	Ngomba kugira icyo nkora.
He was thirty years old.	Yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
I really like it.	Nkunda rwose.
So far, no.	Kugeza ubu, sibyo.
I just didn't see it	Gusa sinigeze mbona
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
He really has to do a lot.	Agomba rwose gukora byinshi.
It was all a mistake.	Byose byari amakosa.
I really should know better	Nkwiye rwose kumenya neza
I’m learning it’s not always a bad thing	Ndimo kwiga ntabwo buri gihe ari ikintu kibi
At that point I felt ashamed	Icyo gihe numvise mfite isoni
Learning to live in fear.	Kwiga kubana ubwoba.
Later, it is possible, but it is not.	Nyuma, birashoboka, ariko sibyo.
He is not the same guy.	Ntabwo ari umusore umwe.
I never heard him say that much.	Sinigeze numva avuga byinshi.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
I really wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga rwose kuvugana nawe
I am working.	Ndimo gukora.
I just wanted to see how everything went	Nashakaga gusa kureba uko ibintu byose byagenze
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I have never seen a woman so bad	Ntabwo nigeze mbona umugore mubi cyane
Can someone help ??.	Umuntu arashobora gufasha ??.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
Everyone is in this room.	Abantu bose bari muri iki cyumba.
One time we have to go.	Igihe kimwe tugomba kugenda.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
And it wasn’t me.	Kandi ntabwo yari njye.
That would be great.	Ibyo byari kuba byiza cyane.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
He did not know what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo.
I didn't see anyone	Ntabwo nabonye umuntu
I know where he is	Nzi aho ari
He could see clearly.	Yashoboraga kubona neza.
I have to go to school	Ngomba kujya ku ishuri
I need to give up	Nkeneye kureka
I think he was	Ntekereza ko yari we
He never had.	Ntiyigeze agira.
I feel like you want to quit.	Numva ushaka kureka.
Knowing that you need this.	Kumenya ko ukeneye ibi.
It was not a big deal for me.	Ntiyari ikintu kinini kuri njye.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
I had his family on the phone	Nari mfite umuryango we kuri terefone
I have a big problem with that	Mfite ikibazo kinini kuri ibyo
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
I'm not here today.	Ntabwo ndi hano muri iki gihe.
I can't find a job	Sinshobora kubona akazi
Things you said.	Ibintu wavuze.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
He didn't say much.	Ntiyigeze avuga byinshi.
He is not my son.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu wanjye.
Playing fees.	Amafaranga yo gukina.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
We.	Ni.
I love the time with her	Nkunda umwanya hamwe na we
I never liked that	Sinigeze nkunda ibyo
It's us.	Ni twe.
It would be nice to see.	Byari kuba byiza kubona.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
I'm not sure, but it's possible.	Ntabwo nzi neza, ariko birashoboka.
It was great to read.	Byari byiza gusoma.
I was very low	Nari hasi cyane yo hasi
She used to be alone.	Yakundaga kuba wenyine.
One like me.	Umwe nkanjye.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I had no reason.	Nta mpamvu nari mfite.
I work here.	Nkora hano.
He knew who he was.	Yari azi uwo ari we.
I think he was good to me	Ndakeka yuko yari mwiza kuri njye
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
I mean this program of yours	Ndashaka kuvuga iyi gahunda yawe
I have a job to do here	Mfite akazi ko gukora hano
I have a plan for that, though.	Mfite gahunda kubyo, ariko.
I knew he was a good person	Nari nzi ko ari umuntu mwiza
That was it.	Ibyo byari.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's what he needed.	Ni cyo yari akeneye.
This is your plan.	Iyi gahunda yawe.
There you are alone.	Hariho wowe wenyine.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
And indeed.	Kandi rwose.
You don't really need to.	Ntabwo ukeneye rwose.
I always thought we were friends, good friends	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko turi inshuti, inshuti nziza
I never got one.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona umwanya umwe.
I thought it was a good gift	Natekereje ko ari impano nziza
I never thought that	Sinigeze ntekereza ko
Absolutely.	Rwose.
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
You are eating when they have nothing to eat.	Urimo kurya mugihe ntacyo bafite cyo kurya.
You actually did it well.	Wowe mubyukuri wabikoze neza.
I really wanted to	Nashakaga rwose
That is very possible.	Ibyo birashoboka cyane.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
Doing something.	Gukora ikintu.
But that was the fear they had.	Ariko ibyo byari ubwoba bari bafite.
You can't work.	Ntushobora gukora.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
We have a lot of phones.	Dufite terefone nyinshi.
You had a family.	Wari ufite umuryango.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I can't wait long	Sinshobora gutegereza igihe kirekire
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
He also mentions problems.	Avuga kandi ibibazo.
I like this one.	Nkunda iyi.
That was a lot of it.	Ibyo byari byinshi muri byo.
He was close.	Yari hafi.
I can't remarry	Sinshobora kongera gushaka
I was scared	Nagize ubwoba
The woman was scared.	Umugore yari afite ubwoba.
I know exactly where you are	Nzi neza aho uri
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
I like to do it that way.	Nkunda kubikora gutya.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
We have none of this.	Nta na kimwe muri byo dufite.
It's good.	Ndi mwiza.
I was not sure of that	Sinari nzi neza ibyo
I need to stay here tonight	Nkeneye kuguma hano muri iri joro
It was good for that.	Byari byiza kuri ibyo.
Especially this one.	Cyane cyane iyi.
The bottom line is good.	Munsi yo hasi ni nziza.
I found that to be true	Nabonye ko aribyo rwose
I wanted to try something else.	Nashakaga kugerageza gukora ikindi kintu.
I am now a woman.	Ubu ndi umugore.
I am also learning a lot	Nanjye ndimo kwiga byinshi
Quit your job, and at home.	Kureka akazi ku kazi, no murugo murugo.
I didn't know enough.	Ntabwo nari nzi bihagije.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I don't know how to do it.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo bwo kubikora.
There is something I feel	Hari ikintu numva
I want to know what it is	Ndashaka kumenya icyo aricyo
All of this was too much.	Ibi byose byari byinshi cyane.
I am a very lucky girl.	Ndi umukobwa ufite amahirwe menshi.
The car is not human	Imodoka ntabwo ari umuntu
Unusual.	Nta bisanzwe.
We are now one.	Ubu turi umwe.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
He thought he was a man in it.	Yatekereje ko ari umuntu muri we.
I'm not sure if that's possible.	Ntabwo nzi neza niba bishoboka.
I hope you can do it	Ndizera ko ushobora kubikora
I am at home.	Ndi murugo.
I didn't know it before.	Sinari nzi neza mbere.
He said, very low, maybe alone.	Yavuze, hasi cyane, ahari wenyine.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
I shouldn't have listened to your advice alone	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kumva inama yawe wenyine
Very good now.	Byiza cyane ubu.
To do so.	Kubikora.
I don't want to go.	Sinshaka kugenda.
I once did.	Nigeze kubikora.
I know exactly where it is	Nzi neza aho ari
I never thought far	Sinigeze ntekereza kure
I would like one day	Ndashaka umunsi umwe
I did it now.	Nakoze ubu.
I know what he wants.	Nzi icyo ashaka.
I have good things to do	Mfite ibintu byiza byo gukora
I know his whole family	Nzi umuryango we wose
What one needs.	Icyo umuntu akeneye.
He would probably drink.	Birashoboka ko yari kunywa.
I didn't know that	Sinari nzi ko aribyo
I don't want to talk to you	Sinshaka kuvugana nawe.
This was here, now.	Ibi byari hano, ubu.
I didn’t want him to feel like a lot of people	Sinifuzaga ko yumva ari abantu benshi
He doesn't need it now.	Ntabwo akeneye ubu.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I haven’t seen much about him since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona byinshi kuri we
I don't see anyone wrong	Ntabwo mbona umuntu ufite amakosa
As much as possible.	Nkuko bishoboka.
I mean this	Ndashaka kuvuga ibi
He had something bad for him.	Yari afite ikintu kibi kuri we.
The house sits far away.	Inzu yicaye kure.
We were there.	Twari aho.
I know what you're looking for	Nzi icyo urimo gushaka
Most people have nothing.	Abantu benshi ntacyo bafite.
It was all.	Yari byose.
I know everything will be fine	Nzi ko byose bizaba byiza
Here, now, is a concern.	Hano, ubu, ni impungenge.
I want to work for a while	Ndashaka gukora igihe gito
He did not know how.	Ntiyari azi uko.
I think he was worried.	Ntekereza ko yari afite impungenge.
Very bad time.	Igihe kibi cyane.
I didn't know where we were	Sinari nzi aho turi
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
I highly doubt he will	Ndashidikanya rwose ko azabikora
That, however, will be a problem.	Ibyo ariko, bizaba ikibazo.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
You didn't do it.	Ntabwo wabikoze.
I know what he means.	Nzi icyo ashaka kuvuga.
No one said anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira icyo avuga.
I can't take a baby right now	Ntabwo nshobora gufata umwana nonaha
I haven't seen it since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona
To this day, he cannot walk.	Kugeza uyu munsi, ntashobora kugenda.
The truth.	Ukuri.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
No one is around.	Nta muntu uri hafi.
He seems scared.	Asa naho afite ubwoba.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
Maybe something else.	Ahari ikindi kintu.
One has to give up that.	Umuntu agomba kureka ibyo.
I didn't want to do anything	Sinifuzaga gukora ikintu na kimwe
I got it right.	Nabonye neza.
He never planned to live with her	Ntiyigeze ateganya kubana na we
I can't hear what he's saying.	Sinshobora kumva ibyo avuga.
You were thinking of something else.	Wari utekereza ikindi kintu.
I'm glad I'm worried	Nishimiye impungenge
I knew nothing	Ntacyo nari nzi
But it was not very good.	Ariko ntiyari mwiza cyane.
I wanted to go back to school	Nashakaga gusubira ku ishuri
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
Tell me the truth.	Mbwira ukuri.
I think we should talk	Ntekereza ko tugomba kuvuga
He was probably thirty years old.	Birashoboka ko yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
I don't want anything else	Sinshaka ikindi
I wanted to know more about him	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi kuri we
You can do whatever you want.	Urashobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
I do not have.	Ntabwo mfite.
It is not a family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo yari menshi.
She loved the day.	Yakundaga umunsi.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
I really need to talk to you	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana nawe
I really heard something	Nukuri numvise ikintu
I desperately needed money	Nari nkeneye amafaranga nabi cyane
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo kuri bose.
I just wanted to do it	Nashakaga gusa kubikora
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
I want to be your wife	Ndashaka kuba umugore wawe
I needed time to think	Nari nkeneye igihe cyo gutekereza
It's a problem for a person	Ni ikibazo ku muntu
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I'm not sure what to think.	Sinzi neza icyo ntekereza.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I can't wait to go to school	Sinshobora gutegereza kujya ku ishuri
He said with embarrassment.	Yavuze afite isoni.
We are in fact.	Turi mubyukuri.
I have good friends and plans	Mfite inshuti nziza na gahunda
I can help with that.	Nshobora gufasha muri ibyo.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
You know you can do a job.	Uzi ko ushobora gukora akazi.
I'm just one person.	Ndi umuntu umwe gusa.
He is here.	Ari hano.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza gusa muri byose.
Behind you	Inyuma yawe.
I am so happy to be both here	Nishimiye cyane kuba bombi hano
From the outside.	Kuva hanze.
I'm not very sure	Ntabwo nzi neza cyane
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I didn't get the chance	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe
Only that is not good.	Gusa ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
The same is true of me.	Kureba kimwe kandi ni kuri njye.
I can do nothing for him	Ntacyo nshobora gukora kuri we
I was just thinking at the moment	Natekerezaga gusa kuri iki gihe
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You should know that by now.	Ugomba kumenya ko kugeza ubu.
Not that he used to be my friend.	Ntabwo ari uko yigeze kuba inshuti yanjye.
That would be normal.	Byaba ari ibintu bisanzwe.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It's a real thing.	Ni ikintu rwose.
I can't help what you think	Sinshobora gufasha icyo utekereza
You can help.	Urashobora gufasha.
Not that he was scared.	Ntabwo ari uko yari afite ubwoba.
It wasn't good enough.	Ntabwo byari byiza bihagije.
And that he is not alone.	Kandi ko atari wenyine.
I can always find the truth in everything	Nshobora buri gihe kubona ukuri muri byose
I know he is right	Nzi ko avuga ukuri
But there is much he cannot do.	Ariko hariho byinshi adashobora gukora.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
You have a family here.	Ufite umuryango hano.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
It was my fault.	Byari amakosa yanjye.
I know what happened but	Nzi uko byagenze ariko
I was very tall.	Nari hejuru cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I can't say anything else on the phone	Ntabwo nshobora kuvuga ikindi kuri terefone
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
But not for everyone.	Ariko si kuri bose.
I want to have a nice house here.	Ndashaka kugira inzu nziza hano.
That is not the case.	Ntabwo ari impamvu.
He did really well.	Yakoze neza rwose.
But not today.	Ariko si iki gihe.
I'm not sure where he is.	Ntazi neza aho ari.
Time.	Igihe.
I did everything.	Nakoze byose.
I was thinking about doing it	Nari natekereje cyane kubikora
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi nibyo rwose.
I want you to be with me, next time	Ndashaka ko muri njye, ikindi gihe
I didn’t really see it as a problem	Ntabwo rwose nabonye ari ikibazo
I saw something	Nabonye ikintu
I was going to find out what it was	Nari ngiye kumenya icyo aricyo
Her hair was beautiful.	Umusatsi we wari mwiza.
I have this.	Mfite ibi.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu.
All recently.	Byose vuba aha.
We are not things.	Ntabwo turi ibintu.
I can do nothing, talk to someone	Ntacyo nshobora gukora, kuvugana numuntu
Once he knew the truth he would know what to do.	Amaze kumenya ukuri yari kumenya icyo gukora.
And he may be right.	Kandi arashobora kuba afite ukuri.
Her son was right.	Umuhungu we yari afite ukuri.
It is up to us.	Ni natwe kuri twe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza cyane.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
I have a problem doing anything	Mfite ikibazo cyo gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
I'm glad you're here, right now	Nishimiye ko uri hano, ubu
I think that's possible.	Ndatekereza ko bishoboka.
Good time for him	Umwanya mwiza kuri we
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
Most people, though.	Abantu benshi, naho.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
One cannot have one.	Umuntu ntashobora kuba afite.
There is another room.	Hariho ikindi cyumba kimwe.
I hope so too.	Ndizera ko nanjye ari.
You can never see that again.	Ntushobora kongera kubona ibyo.
He is the only one who can do that today.	Niwe wenyine ushobora kubikora uyu munsi.
You don't have to see the same thing.	Ntugomba kubona ikintu kimwe.
That was good enough.	Ibyo byari byiza bihagije.
I want to believe that this is true	Ndashaka kwizera ko ibyo ari ukuri
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
But nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe.
I would like to hear his opinion on this issue	Ndashaka kumva igitekerezo cye kuri iki kibazo
I can't say much today.	Sinshobora kuvuga byinshi muri iki gihe.
Normal.	Kuba bisanzwe.
It just doesn’t exist.	Nta kubaho gusa.
And it looks good, too.	Kandi birasa neza, kandi.
I know what we have is true	Nzi ko ibyo dufite ari ukuri
He was here before.	Yari hano mbere.
This is a lot for me.	Ibi ni byinshi kuri njye.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
To his father.	Kuri se.
He tried everything.	Yagerageje byose.
I hope you find the woman you love	Ndizera ko ushobora kubona umugore ukunda
I'm good at this.	Ndi mwiza kuri aba.
I love each one the same	Nkunda buri kimwe kimwe
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekereje cyane kuri ibi
The son becomes the father, and the father the son.	Umuhungu aba se, na se umuhungu.
It hasn't been long.	Ntabwo yamaze igihe kinini.
You need someone who can talk to you.	Ukeneye umuntu ushobora kuvugana nawe.
I really didn't want to go	Sinifuzaga rwose kugenda
You can't do that now.	Ntushobora kubikora nonaha.
But there is only one.	Ariko hariho umwe gusa.
I have my own plan	Mfite gahunda yanjye
There are times.	Hari igihe.
I understand what you need.	Ndumva ibyo ukeneye.
But in reality, he knows nothing.	Ariko mubyukuri, nta kintu na kimwe azi.
It would be easy.	Byaba byoroshye.
I'm glad it was true at the time	Nishimiye ko byari ukuri icyo gihe
I need to work on that	Nkeneye gukora kuri ibyo
Walking was difficult.	Kugenda byari bigoye.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
When it was a party.	Iyo yari ibirori.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I didn’t have the opportunity to see much	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe yo kubona byinshi
All of the above.	Umwanya wose wo hejuru.
Only I was not very involved	Gusa ntabwo nari ndimo cyane
I think he was happy to go	Ndatekereza ko yishimiye kugenda
You said you wanted to.	Wavuze ko ushaka.
I think that's good	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza
The reason for everything	Impamvu ya byose
I hope you find something you like	Nizere ko urimo kubona ibintu ukunda
I look forward to seeing my wife again.	Ndashaka amahirwe yo kongera kubona umugore wanjye.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
We are here now.	Ubu turi hano.
He can't play.	Ntashobora gukina.
I am scared and scared	Mfite ubwoba kandi mfite ubwoba
It was good in front of him.	Byari byiza imbere ye.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I just want you to be away from me and here	Gusa ndashaka ko uri kure yanjye na hano
I know what he thinks	Nzi icyo atekereza
He was his son.	Yari umwana we.
He was good to her.	Yari mwiza kuri we.
I needed to think about it quickly	Nari nkeneye gutekereza kandi vuba
Fear, perhaps.	Ubwoba, ahari.
It was a lot of money.	Byari amafaranga menshi.
He must learn the faith.	Agomba kwiga kwizera.
He is a very bad person.	Ni umuntu mubi cyane.
I want something.	Ndashaka ikintu.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
The day must come soon.	Umunsi ugomba kuza vuba.
Maybe nothing.	Ahari nta kintu na kimwe.
I thought he was scared and alone	Natekereje ko afite ubwoba kandi wenyine
I never thought it would be possible	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza ko bishoboka
Maybe a little.	Ahari gato.
It was true enough.	Byari ukuri bihagije.
He just looked inside.	Yarebye gusa imbere.
You have faith.	Ufite kwizera.
In fact, it is.	Mubyukuri, nibyo.
You are playing.	Urimo gukina.
Good and good.	Cyiza kandi cyiza.
This is a lot	Ibi ni byinshi
It's not close enough.	Ntabwo ari hafi bihagije.
But you can't.	Ariko ntushobora.
All of this is true.	Ibi byose ni ukuri.
I can't wait to be home	Sinshobora gutegereza kuba murugo
I guess so.	Ndakeka yuko aribyo.
I hope your day was a good one today	Nizere ko umunsi wawe wari mwiza uyu munsi
Niki.	Niki.
I did not know this	Ntabwo nari nzi ibi
Everyone had a chance.	Umuntu wese yagize umwanya.
Good book.	Igitabo cyiza.
I can't afford to buy one	Sinshobora kugura umuntu
You are helping.	Urimo gufasha.
I can't be the one you want	Sinshobora kuba uwo ushaka
You can't beat that.	Ntushobora gutsinda ibyo.
He took it a little early.	Yafashe kare gato.
He was the first to do so.	Niwe wa mbere wabikoze.
A gift for what he would do.	Impano kubyo yari gukora.
And that’s not a good plan.	Kandi iyo ntabwo ari gahunda nziza.
I was a good kid.	Nari umwana mwiza.
I have to go to work today	Ngomba kujya mu kazi uyu munsi
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
It's not for me.	Ntabwo ari kuri njye.
You can't give up.	Ntushobora kureka.
Today, however, it is.	Kuri uyu munsi, ariko, ni.
I can be whatever you want	Nshobora kuba icyo ushaka cyose
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
I need to have time	Nkeneye kugira umwanya
I can't wait to read it again.	Sinshobora gutegereza kongera gusoma.
He heard a lot about it.	Yumvise byinshi kuri byo.
I mean here.	Ndashaka kuvuga hano.
But we have to try something.	Ariko tugomba kugerageza ikintu.
I didn't want to come here	Sinifuzaga kuza hano
I knew the food would be good here	Nari nzi ko ibiryo byaba byiza hano
I thought of one thing in a short time	Natekereje ikintu kimwe mugihe gito
I think he went bad	Ndatekereza ko yagiye mubi
He needed help figuring out what to do.	Yari akeneye ubufasha kumenya icyo gukora.
I should have stayed on it	Nari nkwiye kuguma kuri yo
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
This is not easy.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye.
I have to look at something	Ngomba kureba ikintu
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi cyane.
Boy	Umuhungu.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
As he should.	Nkuko agomba.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
He had this.	Yari afite ibi.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
Long live the good.	Igihe kirekire ni cyiza.
I was here and I saw everything	Nari hano kandi nabonye byose
It’s not just money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga gusa.
I needed something to believe	Nari nkeneye ikintu cyo kwizera
I can never see that again	Sinshobora kongera kubona ibyo
No one knew what to expect.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo agomba gutegereza.
No one has ever had this problem before.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira iki kibazo.
I want to see people	Ndashaka kubona abantu
I think that would be a problem.	Ntekereza ko byaba ari ikibazo.
I'm going to do the same thing	Ngiye gukora ikintu kimwe
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
He could understand why.	Yashoboraga kumva impamvu.
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
He never did.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
I would just try	Nari kugerageza gusa
I wanted to find it easy	Nashakaga kubona byoroshye
I have to go back to work.	Ngomba gusubira ku kazi.
He is not young or human.	Ntabwo ari muto cyangwa ngo ni umuntu.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He did not go far.	Ntabwo yagiye kure.
I wanted to learn more.	Nashakaga kwiga byinshi.
I was scared and I had a reason	Nari mfite ubwoba kandi mfite impamvu
And here's a kid.	Kandi hano hari umwana.
I guess that's really, really bad	Ndakeka ko aricyo kintu rwose, kibi rwose
More than anything else.	Kurenza ikindi kintu cyose.
I need to know where you are at all times	Nkeneye kumenya aho uri igihe cyose
I still don't know where he went	Kugeza ubu sinzi aho yagiye
I didn't think I could see anything.	Sinatekerezaga ko hari icyo mbona.
In fact, my whole family was.	Mubyukuri, umuryango wanjye wose wari.
He did this for three years.	Ibyo yabikoze imyaka itatu.
He was very, very young.	Yari muto cyane, muto cyane.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
Like him.	Nka we.
I had a lot of money	Nari mfite amafaranga menshi
This is not your home.	Iyi si inzu yawe.
I guess so	Ndakeka ko aribyo
Yes, there is something you can do.	Nibyo, hari ikintu ushobora gukora.
I need everyone who is so high	Nkeneye abantu bose bari hejuru cyane
I knew they were scared	Nari nzi ko bafite ubwoba
More than that.	Kurenza.
I just can't wait to hear about it	Gusa sinshobora gutegereza kumva ibintu bisanzwe
The kids really had good things to do.	Nukuri abana bari bafite ibintu byiza byo gukora.
No one could see anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kubona ikintu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
It’s a good thing to do.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
I have a son.	Mfite umuhungu.
I doubt there is any truth to it	Ndashidikanya ko hari ukuri kuri kuri
'	'
You have money.	Ufite amafaranga.
And they were very close.	Kandi bari hafi cyane.
I want to be a teacher.	Ndashaka kuba umwarimu.
I didn't see much in it	Ntacyo nabonye muri byinshi
He thought his wife looked good.	Yatekereje ko umugore we asa neza.
I can't go to school	Sinshobora kujya ku ishuri
He did well and well.	Yakoze neza kandi nziza.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
That's what he does.	Nibyo akora.
A woman who knew what she was doing	Umugore wari uzi icyo akora
That's a good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
But playing was hard.	Ariko gukina byari bigoye.
He would have a lot to say about that.	Yaba afite byinshi byo kuvuga kuri ibyo.
He is a young child.	Ni umwana muto.
But it was not hair.	Ariko ntabwo yari umusatsi.
He does just that.	Akora ibyo ari hano.
You should have gotten a wife.	Wari ukwiye kubona umugore.
Everyone wants more.	Umuntu wese arashaka byinshi.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
I didn’t want to do anything about it	Sinifuzaga kugira icyo nkora kuri byo
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
It is beautiful and it is a school.	Ni mwiza kandi ni ishuri.
I thought we should go	Natekereje ko tugomba kugenda
If you have.	Niba ufite.
Today is one.	Uyu munsi ni umwe.
You are not on top.	Ntabwo uri hejuru.
You have to do the same thing.	Ugomba gukora ikintu kimwe.
He was the one who had the truth.	Niwe wari ufite ukuri.
It was not difficult.	Ntabwo byari bigoye.
You don't have to do anything else.	Ntugomba gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
What did he do.	Yakoze iki.
And it wasn't him.	Kandi ntabwo yari we.
That's what he was.	Nibyo yari we.
Stop trying to do well.	Reka kugerageza gukora neza.
I think it’s a matter of looking	Ntekereza ko ari ikibazo cyo kureba
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi bishoboka.
I hope they know who he is	Nizera ko bazi uwo ari we
I thought badly	Natekereje nabi
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I want to know everything, now	Ndashaka kumenya byose, ubu
I didn't see why they were all here	Ntabwo nabonye impamvu bose bari hano rwose
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni uko ibyo bigoye cyane.
I know someone might be there	Nzi umuntu ushobora kuba ahari
Who do you like the most ?.	Ninde ukunda cyane?.
It started for the first time.	Yatangiye bwa mbere.
I feel so good about finally getting it.	Numva ari byiza cyane kubona amaherezo.
We can't have it.	Ntidushobora kugira.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
You don't have to do it alone.	Ntagomba kubikora wenyine.
But it was too much.	Ariko byari byinshi cyane.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
He was the only one who did it.	Ni we wenyine wabikoze.
I wanted to do it early, but I don't know how.	Nashakaga kubikora kare, ariko sinzi uko.
I knew he was gone, whatever	Nari nzi ko yagiye, ibyo aribyo byose
You have to stop looking back.	Ugomba guhagarika kureba inyuma.
Everything is fine here.	Ibintu byose ni byiza hano.
This is his opinion.	Iki ni igitekerezo cye.
I was sure she was my daughter.	Nari nzi neza ko ari umukobwa wanjye.
He looked once.	Yarebye rimwe.
Maybe he could see something.	Birashoboka ko hari ikintu yashoboraga kubona.
I thought he could do it.	Natekerezaga ko ashobora kubikora.
I have nothing to say	Ntacyo nshaka kuvuga
There are many children here.	Hano hari abana benshi.
I had problems	Nari mfite ibibazo
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi ibyo aribyo byose
But that was not the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari ukuri.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
I should have stayed on the bus	Nari nkwiye kuguma kuri bisi
And it is, in a short time.	Kandi ni, mugihe gito.
I saw that he knew what he was doing	Nabonye ko azi ibyo akora
He had.	Yari afite.
You can actually do it.	Urashobora gukora mubyukuri.
The experiment was successful.	Kugerageza byagenze neza.
I didn't think so	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo
I thought it was something to learn.	Natekereje ko ari ikintu cyo kwiga.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
You want to believe.	Ushaka kwizera.
We are here to raise money.	Turi hano gushaka amafaranga.
Any boy could do that.	Umuhungu wese yashoboraga kubikora.
Good driving.	Gutwara neza.
She has always loved her daughter.	Yakundaga umukobwa we kuva mbere.
I did nothing wrong	Nta kibi nakoze
This is a bad thing.	Iki kintu kibi.
He can do whatever he wants, as he pleases, now.	Arashobora gukora icyo ashaka cyose, uko ashaka, ubu.
On the first day, she was fine.	Ku munsi wa mbere, yari mwiza.
He was really tonight.	Yari muri iri joro rwose.
The girl was right.	Umukobwa yari afite ukuri.
Seeing people.	Kubona abantu.
He tried to get everything.	Yagerageje kubona byose.
He doesn't feel good.	Ntabwo yumva ari byiza.
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.
Very close.	Hafi cyane.
I had that on top of him.	Nari mfite ibyo hejuru ye.
I'm worried about him	Mfite impungenge kuri we
I never heard my phone	Sinigeze numva terefone yanjye
But it's really good !.	Ariko nibyiza rwose!.
But sometimes you can.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe urashobora.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
He is not sitting well.	Ntabwo yicaye neza.
I was ashamed of him	Nagize isoni nka we
Anything you want is.	Ikintu cyose ushaka ni.
A gift to me.	Impano kuri njye.
She is not my daughter.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa wanjye.
You can definitely get a chance.	Urashobora kubona neza amahirwe.
I can't go back down	Sinshobora gusubira hasi
I think that will all be the case today	Ntekereza ko ibyo bizaba byose kuri uyu munsi
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni byiza cyane kuri byo.
I don't even have to be here	Ntabwo ngomba no kuba hano
I don't like your plan.	Ntabwo nkunda gahunda yawe.
I don’t have much time to wait	Ntabwo mfite igihe kinini cyo gutegereza
I want to know what it is	Ndashaka kumenya icyo aricyo
These are the problems.	Ibi ni ibibazo.
I have to be outside.	Ngomba kuba ndi hanze.
He may be telling the truth.	Ashobora kuba avuga ukuri.
But he was my friend	Ariko yari inshuti yanjye
I just don’t want to do it	Ntabwo nshaka kubikora gusa
He must be ashamed.	Agomba kubona afite isoni.
I hope you can do it	Nizere ko ushobora kubikora
There is.	Hariho.
I think so	Ntekereza ko ari byo
I needed to work fast	Nari nkeneye gukora vuba
But, I felt good.	Ariko, numvise ari byiza.
I can't see normal	Sinshobora kubona bisanzwe
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
There are people who have nothing to eat and drink.	Hariho abantu ntacyo bafite cyo kurya no kunywa.
You are right.	Ufite ukuri.
I want to know more	Ndashaka kumenya neza
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
I knew he would do it	Nari nzi ko azabikora
The child can do it	Umwana arashobora kubikora
He wanted everything right.	Yashakaga ibintu byose neza.
And let it be.	Reka kandi.
He thought about his choice.	Yatekereje ku byo yahisemo.
I think she is very good	Ntekereza ko ari mwiza cyane
He was very young and very beautiful.	Yari muto cyane kandi mwiza cyane.
I want to try something	Ndashaka kugerageza ikintu
He knows that.	Azi uko.
Inside to the top.	Imbere kugeza hejuru.
I knew what had happened	Nari nzi uko byagenze
I think we should try	Ntekereza ko tugomba kugerageza
Shopping was easy.	Kugura byari byoroshye.
I didn't know what to think	Sinari nzi icyo utekereza
The car began to slow down.	Imodoka yatangiye gusubira inyuma.
I'm glad he does	Nishimiye ko abikora
I think you can overcome this	Ndatekereza ko ushobora gutsinda ibi
I thought it would be here	Natekereje ko byari kuba hano
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
Absolutely.	Rwose.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I was with you	Nagize nawe
I was an outsider in all of this.	Nari umuntu wo hanze muri ibyo byose.
'	'
But I don't know what happened.	Ariko ntazi uko byagenze.
I thought about it tonight	Natekereje kuri iri joro
You know the problems.	Uzi ibibazo.
With you everything was fine.	Hamwe nawe ibintu byose byari byiza.
Early in the morning	Mu gitondo cya kare.
One of us has to go	Umwe muri twe agomba kugenda
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
I can't believe it	Sinshobora kwizera uko ari
I should have done more	Nari nkwiye gukora byinshi
I saw all that	Nabonye ibyo byose
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko mubyukuri.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He finally has everything he wants.	Amaherezo afite ibyo ashaka byose.
I have to tell everyone something	Ngomba kubwira abantu bose ikintu
Big is good.	Kinini ni byiza.
I can't take anyone	Ntabwo nshobora gufata umuntu uwo ari we wese
Sometimes it is possible.	Rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.

He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
I wanted to hear it again	Nashakaga kongera kumva
He was worried about her.	Yari afite impungenge kuri we.

Or just an idea.	Cyangwa igitekerezo gusa.
You have to come.	Ugomba kuza.
He told me many and many things.	Yambwiye ibintu byinshi kandi byinshi.

Everything was simple.	Ibintu byose byari byoroshye.

It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
And what it is, what it is.	Kandi icyo aricyo, ni iki.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko atari byo.
All he knew was that he was gone.	Icyo yari azi gusa, yari yagiye.
All that is possible is good.	Ibyo bishoboka byose nibyiza.

For him alone.	Kuri we wenyine.
Or outside.	Cyangwa ari hanze.
He is someone who wants to hear.	Ni umuntu ushaka kumva.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko agomba gukora vuba.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.

Little did I know that everything was going to be easy	Ntabwo nari nzi ko byose byari byoroshye
This is another time.	Iki ni ikindi gihe.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
It was easy to read.	Byari byoroshye gusoma.
Going home alone	Gutaha murugo wenyine
I didn't see anything or anyone	Ntacyo nabonye cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese
I think of him well.	Ndatekereza kuri we neza.
He is not who he is.	Ntabwo ari uwo ari we.

Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari birashoboka.
He wanted it all day.	Yashakaga umunsi wose.
He didn't want to be here.	Ntiyashakaga kuba hano.
I made friends	Nagize inshuti
It wasn't good enough.	Ntabwo byari byiza bihagije.
He thought badly.	Yatekereje nabi.

Absolutely and absolutely.	Rwose kandi rwose.
Now he seems to be bad.	Ubu asa nkaho ari mubi.

One can do it.	Umuntu arashobora kubikora.

They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.

Somewhere his family is out.	Hari aho umuryango we uri hanze.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
He could see and hear.	Yashoboraga kubona nawe yumva.

He had to do something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo akora.
I didn't hear anything	Nta na kimwe numvise
I was scared of everything	Nari mfite ubwoba kuri byose
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yagiye rwose.
Probably not, but you can.	Birashoboka ko atari byo, ariko urashobora kugira amahirwe.
Young man	Umusore muto.

I just hope we can.	Gusa ndizera ko dushobora.
Seeing the kids was great.	Kubona abana byari byiza.

Her child was in her.	Umwana we yari muri we.

I believe in many things	Nizera ibintu byinshi
He would not go.	Ntiyari kugenda.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.

She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.

I wanted to see how you do	Nashakaga kureba uko ukora
I needed to go.	Nari nkeneye kugenda.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.

Of course, today is not the day.	Ni ukuri, uyu munsi ntabwo ari umunsi.

That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It would have been easier.	Byari kuba byoroshye.
I need to work on my plan	Nkeneye gukora kuri gahunda yanjye
We are in this together.	Turi muri ibi hamwe.
I had nothing	Nta na kimwe nari mfite
That is very possible.	Ibyo birashoboka cyane.

That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
I don't think so	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo
He gave each of us.	Yahaye umwe wese muri twe.

Money must be.	Amafaranga agomba kuba.
No big deal so far.	Nta kibazo kinini kugeza ubu.
He never spoke.	Ntiyigeze avuga.
You can't hear a thing.	Ntushobora kumva ikintu.
I was going to do it	Nari ngiye kubikora
I was here today.	Nari hano uyu munsi.

I didn’t want to see anyone	Sinifuzaga kubona umuntu
He thought about where they were.	Yatekereje aho bari.
I have to win	Ngomba gutsinda
I guess that's all he could see	Ndakeka ko aribyo byose yashoboraga kubona
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I didn't find it easy	Ntabwo nabonye ibyo byoroshye
I have.	Mfite.
We had a plan.	Twari dufite gahunda.
I did nothing wrong here	Nta kibi nakoze hano
I know you've seen it all	Nzi ko wabonye byose
I can't see anything about it.	Ntacyo nshobora kubona kuri yo.
He went outside	Yagiye hanze
But it is too high.	Ariko ni hejuru cyane.
I like to play with him	Nkunda gukina na we
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I have money, a lot of money	Mfite amafaranga, amafaranga menshi
The child is at home.	Umwana ari murugo.
I don’t think it will be human	Ntabwo ntekereza ko bizaba abantu
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I really did this time	Nukuri nakoze iki gihe
It will be one day.	Bizaba umunsi umwe.
I want to go back to my house	Ndashaka gusubira mu nzu yanjye
Everyone has that.	Umuntu wese afite ibyo.
This, of course, is not the case.	Ibi, mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
Together.	Kuri hamwe.
I think he always has	Ntekereza ko buri gihe afite
You don't have to know a thing by yourself.	Ntagomba kumenya ikintu wenyine.
I have never liked it before	Sinigeze nkunda kuva mbere
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
Everything went smoothly in the end.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza amaherezo.

It's not a day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi.
I don't think so	Ntekereza ko nta na kimwe muri byo
But it was better.	Ariko byari byiza kuruta.
I want to quit	Ndashaka kureka
It was a great time.	Wari umwanya mwiza mugihe.
I didn't want to do that	Sinifuzaga kubikora
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
You can take the same.	Urashobora gufata kimwe.
I didn't want to be here.	Ntabwo nashakaga kuba hano.
I was lucky	Nari nagize amahirwe
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
A good scientist has gone bad	Umuhanga mwiza yagiye mubi
I love my son.	Nkunda umuhungu wanjye.
But in the short term.	Ariko mugihe gito.
He may have thought it was you.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje ko ari wowe.
I really want to talk to you	Ndashaka cyane kuvugana nawe
I am very happy to do so	Nishimiye cyane kubikora
You have seen many things.	Wabonye ibintu byinshi.
You're going to wait here.	Ugiye gutegereza hano.
I can't say for sure	Sinshobora kuvuga neza icyo aricyo
I wanted to be with you tonight	Nashakaga kubana na iri joro
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You can't see anything.	Ntushobora kubona ikintu na kimwe.
I was not sure about him	Ntabwo nari nzi neza kuri we
I feel right.	Ndumva ari ukuri.
I think it's the same here.	Ntekereza ko ari kimwe hano.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
I was absolutely fine	Nari mfite neza rwose
It was good though.	Byari byiza ariko.
I just thought you looked good	Gusa natekereje ko usa neza
And nothing recently.	Kandi nta na kimwe vuba aha.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
He did that.	Ibyo yabikoze.
Everyone.	Abantu bose.
I just don’t know what, if anything, faith is.	Gusa sinzi icyo, niba aricyo cyose, kwizera.
You can't do well.	Ntushobora gukora neza.
From then on, it was very easy.	Kuva aho, byari byoroshye cyane.
I know you know who he is	Nzi ko uzi uwo ari we
I think it's a good thing	Ntekereza ko ari ibintu byiza
Nothing too bad.	Nta kintu kibi cyane.
I think you know a lot of that	Ntekereza ko uzi byinshi muri byo
We had a plan.	Twari dufite gahunda.
I feel like it is.	Ndumva ari, ni.
After all, it’s a book.	Nyuma, ni igitabo.
I like to talk.	Nkunda kuvuga.
Time, well.	Igihe, neza.
I never thought about that !.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo!.
Not much to do, really.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo gukora, mubyukuri.
In any case, the waiting time is short.	Muri ibyo aribyo byose, igihe cyo gutegereza ni gito.
I didn't know it was real	Ntabwo nari nzi ko mubyukuri
He wants something else.	Arashaka ikindi kintu.
I was not sure what he meant.	Sinari nzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He was worried about me.	Yari afite impungenge kuri njye.
I don’t have much to do today	Nta byinshi mfite byo gukora uyu munsi
I've seen a lot of things here	Nabonye ibintu byinshi hano
You are walking.	Muri kugenda.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
But that, of course, is not the case.	Ariko ibyo, mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
You can go home now.	Urashobora gutaha nonaha.
However, this is not always the case.	Ariko, ntabwo mubyukuri aribyo byoroshye.
No one to talk to now.	Nta muntu wo kuvugana nonaha.
I didn’t know if this was normal	Sinari nzi niba ibi byari bisanzwe
I think he has a good idea	Ntekereza ko afite igitekerezo cyiza
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
I know why he likes it now	Nzi impamvu akunda ubu
He is trying to speak.	Arimo kugerageza kuvuga.
I would say bad things.	Nari kuvuga nabi.
I saw a bad person	Nabonye umuntu mubi
I need to get out of everything	Nkeneye kuva muri byose
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
I truly believe that one can live together	Ndizera rwose ko umuntu ashobora kubana
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
I thought.	Natekerezaga.
I think it's probably me	Ntekereza ko bishoboka ko ari njye
In the end it was too much.	Amaherezo byari byinshi cyane.
I thought of something	Natekereje ku kintu
That is the problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo.
I didn't really want to come here	Sinifuzaga kuza hano rwose
I can't go back	Sinshobora gusubira imbere
If you need to do it.	Niba ukeneye kubikora.
You are the right person for me.	Uri umuntu ukwiye kuri njye.
As they knew everything.	Nkuko bari bazi ikintu cyose.
I wonder when he has done that	Ndabaza igihe amaze abikora
I feel nothing for him	Ntacyo numva kuri we
I guess he was thinking	Ndakeka ko yatekerezaga
He said he was gone.	Yavuze ko yagiye.
You want time.	Urashaka umwanya.
I thought that was what he wanted.	Natekereje ko aricyo yashakaga.
I needed to get back to work	Nari nkeneye gusubira ku kazi
I know and love people	Nzi kandi nkunda abantu
He thought that was what he needed.	Yatekereje ko aricyo yari akeneye.
I hope you like this one.	Nizere ko ukunda uyu.
Maybe his clothes.	Ahari imyenda ye.
I should know better than to try now	Nkwiye kumenya neza kuruta kugerageza nonaha
Live for a while	Kubaho gato
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was a great experience	Byari ibintu byiza cyane
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Why are you so beautiful	Kuki uri mwiza cyane?
I can't go to school	Sinshobora kujya ku ishuri
I wonder if anyone knows if that is the case	Ndabaza niba hari uzi niba aribyo
Everything is really good.	Byose ni byiza rwose.
I can't play.	Sinshobora gukina.
You are nothing.	Ntacyo uri cyo.
He wanted to say more.	Yashakaga kuvuga byinshi.
I needed it from there	Nari nkeneye kuva aho
We all have.	Twese dufite.
He may or may not do it.	Ashobora cyangwa ntashobora kubikora.
I can't do anything again	Ntabwo nshobora kongera gukora ikintu na kimwe
I can't stay here for long	Sinshobora kuguma hano igihe kirekire
I didn't know your plan	Sinari nzi gahunda yawe
I know exactly what he can do.	Nzi neza icyo ashobora gukora.
Out of clothes.	Hanze imyenda.
I wanted to go	Nashakaga kujyana
I am looking for a friend	Ndashaka inshuti yanjye
He has.	Afite.
You have to have everyone !.	Ugomba kugira abantu bose!.
Let go of fear.	Kureka ubwoba.
I needed to go back.	Nari nkeneye gusubira inyuma.
I guess it was normal	Ndakeka ko byari bisanzwe
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
I haven't seen it since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona
And it would go.	Kandi byari kugenda.
I thought.	Natekereje.
Everyone was right.	Abantu bose bari bafite ukuri.
I didn't know what to say.	Sinari nzi icyo avuga.
It was something else, man.	Yari ikindi kintu, umuntu.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi ibyo aribyo
He also went to hear.	Yagiye no kumva.
I found nothing good.	Ntacyo nabonye cyiza.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
And he didn't know what to think.	Kandi ntabwo yari azi igitekerezo cyo kubona.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
I just knew it would be around	Nari nzi gusa ko bizaba hafi
It can't be too far.	Ntashobora kuba kure cyane.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
I am not an expert	Ntabwo ndi umuhanga
Good dog, good dog.	Imbwa nziza, imbwa nziza.
I knew they knew something.	Nari nzi ko hari icyo bazi.
I don't even have my phone.	Nta na terefone yanjye.
He was in his right age.	Yari afite imyaka ye neza.
I hope that is not a mistake	Nizere ko ibyo atari amakosa
I shouldn’t have said too much	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuvuga cyane
I wanted to talk to you about this issue	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe kuri iki kibazo
But he had to work.	Ariko yagombaga gukora.
I know that is the reason	Nzi ko iyo ari yo mpamvu
I was looking for a dog to look at	Nashakaga imbwa yo kureba
I'm glad things happened	Nishimiye uko ibintu byagenze
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
I never saw many friends in prison	Sinigeze mbona inshuti nyinshi muri gereza
I wonder if he saw anything	Ndabaza niba hari icyo yabonye
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
I need my money.	Nkeneye amafaranga yanjye.
I need to know everything	Nkeneye kumenya byose
It is not very easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye cyane.

I was right about this.	Nari mfite neza ibi.
I didn’t know, as it happened.	Ntabwo nari nzi, nkuko byagenze.
I have never liked it before.	Sinigeze nkunda kuva mbere.

That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I like to do things well	Nkunda gukora ibintu neza
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I had no problem	Nta kibazo nagize
Let it all go.	Kureka byose.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
They had none.	Ntabwo bari bafite.
I didn’t think you wanted more	Sinatekerezaga ko ushaka byinshi
We have to look at this.	Tugomba kureba kuri ibi.
She is a beautiful, beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza, mwiza.
I just hope he is a good guy	Gusa nizere ko ari umusore mwiza
I have something else to do first	Mfite ikindi kintu cyo gukora mbere
But how long?	Ariko kugeza ryari?.
They may have been there.	Birashoboka ko bari aho bari.
I never wanted to work in a movie	Sinigeze nshaka gukora muri firime
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza icyo aricyo.
I need a little time	Nkeneye igihe gito
It was great !.	Byari byiza cyane!.
I didn't get the chance to do it	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe yo kubikora
I want to leave	Ndashaka kuva aho
But he was gone.	Ariko yari yagiye.
I never heard of anything	Sinigeze numva ikintu
He had everything he needed.	Ibyo yari akeneye byose.
Her hair is so beautiful.	Umusatsi we ni mwiza cyane.
I love that for him	Nkunda ibyo kuri we
That's good.	Ni byiza.
But that was true.	Ariko ibyo byari ukuri.
I was a good teacher	Nari umwarimu mwiza
I wanted him to do it	Nashakaga ko abikora
I just wanted him to be a good boy	Nashakaga gusa ko aba umuhungu mwiza
I needed to know the truth	Nari nkeneye kumenya ukuri
You would know if that is the case.	Wari kumenya niba aribyo.
I like to help people	Nkunda gufasha abantu
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
Opportunity to know things	Amahirwe yo kumenya ibintu
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.
I am a young man who loves money.	Ndi umusore ukunda amafaranga.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
The child was frightened and intelligent.	Umwana yari afite ubwoba kandi azi ubwenge.
But not now.	Ariko si nonaha.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
And it is possible soon.	Kandi birashoboka vuba vuba.
I think that's true	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri
I thought it was you	Natekereje ko ari wowe
They have a daughter.	Bafite umukobwa.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Being a woman is good.	Kuba umugore nibyiza.
That was not what he was hoping for.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yizeye.
He did nothing.	Ntiyigeze agira icyo akora.
I can't think straight	Sinshobora gutekereza neza
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi cyane ushobora kujyana.
I hope you can drive	Ndizera ko ushobora gutwara
Nice to meet you.	Nishimiye kubana nawe.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
And it was true.	Kandi byari ukuri.
He really wants to be close.	Yifuza cyane kuba hafi.
In any case, it is not true.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo ari ukuri.
I have no problem.	Nta kibazo mfite.
It is not my family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango wanjye.
I am a very young girl.	Ndi umukobwa muto cyane.
I can't see anything today	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu na kimwe uyu munsi
I should have been here	Nari nkwiye kuba hano
He knew exactly what to do, a lot to do.	Yari azi neza icyo gukora, byinshi byo gukora.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
I had to think about what he wanted	Nari nkwiye gutekereza kubyo yashakaga
Not much to see.	Nta byinshi byo kubona.
I want to.	Ndashaka ko.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Anyone who has received any feedback.	Umuntu wese wabonye igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose.
I want something else	Ndashaka ikindi kintu
You have something.	Urimo ikintu.
You are a good boy.	Uri umuhungu mwiza.
One must always be evil.	Buri gihe umuntu agomba kuba mubi.
I didn't know it was possible	Sinari nzi ko bishoboka
He was his first friend.	Yari inshuti ye ya mbere.
I knew it now, and I did.	Nari nzi neza ubu, nanjye.
I know the plan.	Nzi gahunda.
I understand if.	Ndumva niba.
It's clear.	Biragaragara neza.
I can't eat.	Sinshobora kurya.
We were in the same class at school.	Twari mu ishuri rimwe ku ishuri.
The day is good.	Umunsi ni mwiza.
He is a bad person	Ni umuntu mubi
Very short time.	Igihe gito cyane.
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Yambwiye ko ashaka kuvugana nanjye.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
I think that's good	Ndakeka ko ibyo aribyo byiza
A good person can be bad	Umuntu mwiza arashobora kuba mubi
But something.	Ariko ikintu.
I'm glad to be under him	Nishimiye kuba munsi ye
I have to go to a meeting.	Ngomba kujya mu nama.
I think so.	Ndatekereza ko.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
But, but.	Ariko, ariko.
He could see why.	Yashoboraga kubona impamvu.
We had where I am.	Twari dufite aho ndi.
Everything will happen.	Ibintu byose bizaba.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
But really, it's really nice to be here.	Ariko mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose kuba hano.
That was very difficult.	Ibyo byari bigoye cyane.
I know how he works	Nzi uko akora
I can't let anyone do that	Sinshobora kureka umuntu uwo ari we wese abikora
One by one, everyone had their time.	Umwe umwe, buri wese yagize igihe cye.
I didn't hear anything	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise
One by one.	Umwe hamwe.
I need time to think.	Nkeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo birasa gusa.
Only.	Gusa.
I like to try.	Nkunda kugerageza.
He was expecting it.	Yari yiteze.
It's not you.	Ntabwo ari nawe.
You can hear it.	Urashobora kumva.
I thought.	Natekereje.
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
I think it would really be close.	Ntekereza ko mubyukuri byaba hafi.
No one is inside.	Nta muntu n'umwe uri imbere.
That's just me.	Nibyo njye gusa.
This is his first book.	Iki ni igitabo cye cya mbere.
I think it would be nice	Ndakeka ko byaba byiza
That's normal.	Nibyo bisanzwe.
But that's right.	Ariko ibyo ni byo.
I had only one idea	Nari mfite igitekerezo kimwe gusa
And the baby is beautiful.	Kandi umwana ni mwiza.
I was really scared.	Nagize ubwoba rwose.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
I know nothing about him.	Ntacyo nzi kuri we.
His house would not be his house.	Inzu ye ntiyari kuba inzu ye.
She knows how to read people.	Azi gusoma abantu.
Anyone who wants to talk can talk.	Umuntu wese ushaka kuvuga arashobora kuvuga.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo byose.
For me, it’s not a job.	Kuri njye, ntabwo ari akazi.
And it was difficult.	Kandi byari bigoye.
I want to know what to do	Ndashaka kumenya icyo gukora
In fact, it is only true.	Mubyukuri, ni ukuri gusa.
I never wanted any of that	Sinigeze nshaka na kimwe muri byo
But that is not what he wanted now.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo yashakaga ubu.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
A woman could have	Umugore yashoboraga kugira
'	'
I need to tell someone that	Nkeneye kubwira umuntu ibyo
I knew it was true	Nari nzi ko aribyo rwose
You always want more.	Buri gihe ushaka byinshi.
In fact a lot of catching up.	Mubyukuri byinshi byo gufata.
And this one.	Kandi iyi.

I didn't know anything	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi neza
Not really good.	Mubyukuri ntabwo ari byiza.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I didn't hear what you meant	Ntabwo numvise icyo ushaka kuvuga
I wanted to know more about that.	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi kuri ibyo.
I think there is a lot	Ntekereza ko hari byinshi
Up, up, up.	Hejuru, hejuru, hejuru.
He thought of her	Yatekereje kuri we

He was too.	Na we yari.
I knew exactly what he meant	Nari nzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga
Everyone wanted a plan.	Umuntu wese yashakaga gahunda.
She thought of swimming well	Yatekereje koga neza
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I want to go home.	Ndashaka gutaha.
You don’t have to come every day.	Ntugomba kuza buri munsi.
There is a problem though.	Hariho ikibazo naho.
I really wanted to do it	Nashakaga rwose kubikora
I don't know why it would be so bad	Ntabwo nzi impamvu yaba mubi
That fact must be taken into account. "	Ibyo byari ukuri, mubyukuri ikintu cyiza.
You can stay.	Urashobora kuguma.
He was still very good.	Yari akiri mwiza rwose.
I'm sure he is	Nzi neza ko ari we
It's my age.	Ni imyaka yanjye.
They both knew what to do.	Bombi bari bazi icyo gukora.
I can't and you can't	Ntabwo nshobora kandi nawe ntushobora
Very little space	Umwanya muto cyane
He saw his father.	Yabonye se.
I have a family upstairs	Mfite umuryango hejuru
I needed to know where the money had gone.	Nari nkeneye kumenya aho amafaranga yagiye.
I can't go back now.	Ntashobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
It was not good at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo byari byiza.
You're just a boy.	Uri umuhungu gusa.
He is my son.	Ni umuhungu wanjye.
I was very tall	Nari hejuru cyane
You too.	Nawe.
He didn't know what it was, but he would do it.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo, ariko yari kubikora.

He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
I didn't hear anything	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise
You probably have a good reason.	Birashoboka ko ufite impamvu nziza.
I was looking for a friend	Nashakaga inshuti
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari kuri.
He was close to many.	Yari hafi ya byinshi.
I hear his opinion.	Ndumva igitekerezo cye.
At the time, it was easy.	Icyo gihe byari byoroshye.
I knew it was a good idea	Nari nzi ko ari igitekerezo cyiza
I need someone to take care of	Nkeneye umuntu gufata
But he is.	Ariko ni we.
But no one did.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
I can't believe my luck	Sinshobora kwizera amahirwe yanjye
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
This is very likely to be the case	Ibi birashoboka cyane ko atari byo
I was just behind	Nari inyuma gusa
It would be easy enough.	Byaba byoroshye bihagije.
I thought it was good.	Natekerezaga ko ari byiza.
I knew that was what he wanted	Nari nzi ko aricyo yashakaga
But there is one big problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kimwe kinini.
I never really saw each other as friends	Ntabwo rwose nabonye turi inshuti

No need to talk.	Nta mpamvu yo kuvuga.
I know the family well	Nzi umuryango neza

I think that’s a lot of it	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byinshi muri byo
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
This is not just a chance.	Ibi ntabwo ari amahirwe gusa.

No one has done much in that regard.	Nta muntu wigeze akora ikintu kinini muri ibyo.
And he saw nothing.	Kandi nta kintu yabonye.
I'm glad you're my daughter	Nishimiye ko uri umukobwa wanjye
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo byiza cyane muri iki gihe.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
More than most, in fact.	Kuruta benshi, mubyukuri.
I didn’t mean to say, not really	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga, ntabwo mubyukuri

I may be doing something really wrong.	Nshobora kuba nkora ikintu kibi rwose.
He did, one thing.	Yakoze, ikintu kimwe.
But you know what, he's a good guy.	Ariko uzi icyo, ni umusore mwiza.
This may have been good.	Ibi birashoboka ko byari byiza.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
I thought you said he was human	Natekereje ko wavuze ko ari umuntu
We can't win.	Ntidushobora gutsinda.
To the one person in front of you.	Ku muntu umwe imbere yawe.
I was worried he didn't want to	Nagize impungenge ko adashaka
You are a good child.	Uri umwana mwiza.
You can't work, you can't even think.	Ntushobora gukora, ntushobora no gutekereza neza.
One has to be really inside.	Umwe agomba kuba mubyukuri imbere.
Today, he had none.	Uyu munsi, ntabwo yari afite.
I am not one.	Ntabwo ndi umwe.
And not now.	Kandi si ubu.
I just wasn’t sure if it was enough	Gusa sinari nzi neza niba bihagije
He was not worried.	Ntiyari afite impungenge.
I thought a lot	Natekerezaga cyane
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
Not all together.	Ntabwo bose hamwe.
I was a child at the time	Icyo gihe nari umwana
I know you like that	Nzi ko ukunda gutya
I know you have faith	Nzi ko ufite kwizera
I never thought much of it	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza cyane
I have to try and find friends	Ngomba kugerageza no gushaka inshuti
They are just people.	Ni abantu gusa.
I don't have to be scared anymore	Ntabwo ngomba kongera kugira ubwoba
No one needs to know.	Nta muntu n'umwe ukeneye kumenya.
I would not go well	Ntabwo nari kugenda neza
Easy and simple.	Byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
I worked until dinner	Nakoze kugeza igihe cyo kurya
I always feel	Numva buri gihe
But he did not know for sure.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza.
This is a simple matter.	Ibi ni ibintu byoroshye.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I thought so	Natekereje ko aribyo
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
I may have thought.	Nshobora kuba natekereje.
I'm not sure	Ntabwo nzi neza
There are many reasons.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I do things, you do things	Nkora ibintu, ukora ibintu
We are all scared.	Twese dufite ubwoba.
Very nice guy	Umusore mwiza cyane
You're going to tell me everything wrong.	Ugiye kumbwira buri kintu kibi.
I just want to say	Ndashaka kuvuga gusa
He took the time.	Yafashe igihe.
I wanted to be home	Nashakaga kuba murugo
Maybe this is good.	Ahari ibi nibyiza.
He never did anything alone.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora wenyine.
You can go back to work.	Urashobora gusubira ku kazi.
It's not just here.	Ntabwo ari hano gusa.
He told me.	Yambwiye.
I never wanted to live in that	Sinigeze nshaka kubaho muri ibyo
And they would actually say anything.	Kandi mubyukuri bari kuvuga ikintu cyose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
I should have known better than to do that	Nari nkwiye kumenya neza kuruta kubikora
But now he is very close.	Ariko ubu ari hafi cyane.
Positive thinking	Gutekereza neza
I can't do enough	Ntabwo nshobora gukora bihagije
I saw the back.	Nabonye inyuma.
It was really nice to stay here.	Byari byiza rwose kuguma hano.
He was not scared, but he was scared.	Ntabwo yari afite ubwoba, ariko yari afite ubwoba.
He needed to see.	Yari akeneye kubona.
It was a simple, normal thing.	Byari ibintu byoroshye, bisanzwe.
But we can't stay here.	Ariko ntidushobora kuguma hano.
He is a young man.	Ni umusore.
This morning, he was right.	Muri iki gitondo, yari afite ukuri.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
He was not an expert enough.	Ntabwo yari umuhanga bihagije.
He could see that he was doing it.	Yashoboraga kubona arimo kubikora.
I never wanted to	Sinigeze nshaka
I'm glad you like it.	Nishimiye ko ukunda.
This is a new plan.	Iyi ni gahunda nshya.
Many problems arise.	Ibibazo byinshi biragaragara.
And he didn't know what to think.	Kandi ntiyari azi neza icyo yibwira.
I didn't think so.	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo.
He wanted to know if he could help.	Yashakaga kumenya niba ashobora gufasha.
I think that's the same thing	Ntekereza ko icyo ari ikintu kimwe
I love everything	Nkunda buri kintu cyose
He knew who he was talking about.	Yari azi uwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I really need to go.	Nkeneye rwose kugenda.
I thought he looked good	Natekereje ko asa neza
I know it's not far away	Nzi ko atari kure
It looked good.	Yasaga neza.
This is not enough.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo bihagije.
That was a great thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I have to go back.	Ngomba gusubira inyuma.
None of us knew this very well.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari uzi neza ibi.
I had time to think tonight.	Nagize umwanya wo gutekereza muri iri joro.
He came a long way and sat down.	Yaje kure cyane yicaye.
He is one and only.	Ni umwe kandi wenyine.
It would be very difficult.	Byaba bigoye cyane.
Just one day.	Umunsi umwe gusa.
You have no problem.	Nta kibazo ufite.
There are so many.	Hariho benshi cyane.
Or once.	Cyangwa rimwe.
I want to work harder today	Ndashaka gukora cyane uyu munsi
You are the only one here.	Wowe wenyine wenyine hano.
True faith is your friend.	Kwizera ukuri ni inshuti yawe.
I shouldn’t have done that	Sinari nkwiye kubikora
But that was far from over	Ariko ibyo byari kure cyane
That's good.	Nibyiza.
We need something to do	Dukeneye ibyo gukora
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
This is not a movie.	Ntabwo ari iyi firime.
You can do it right and you have to do it.	Urashobora gukora neza kandi ugomba kubikora.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
You have to see that coming.	Ugomba kubona ko kuza.
But he will do it.	Ariko azabikora.
I can help with that	Nshobora gufasha muri ibyo
He was not.	Ntiyari.
I want a car.	Ndashaka imodoka.
I can definitely do it outside	Nshobora rwose kubikora hanze
It's really worrying.	Ni impungenge rwose.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
I was not very good.	Ntabwo nari mwiza cyane.
But they all have the truth.	Ariko bose bafite ukuri.
I want to go out	Ndashaka kujya hanze
This is the same time.	Iki gihe kimwe.
I can't go.	Sinshobora kugenda.
I was worried it wasn't him	Nari mfite impungenge ko atari we
I love women.	Nkunda umugore.
I never understood why	Sinigeze numva neza impamvu
Yesterday he had everything he wanted.	Ejo yari afite ibyo yashakaga byose.
Am I the only one?	Uyu ni njye wenyine?.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
Very short time.	Igihe gito cyane.
I just like to see things clearly	Nkunda gusa kubona ibintu neza
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The top guy was in the meeting.	Umusore wo hejuru yari mu nama.
I'm going to work.	Ngiye ku kazi.
The same is true of the early.	Kimwe nukuri kuri kare.
I can't, really.	Ntashobora, mubyukuri.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Sometimes it is not.	Rimwe na rimwe sibyo.
I mean, for everyone	Ndashaka kuvuga ko kuri bose
Sometimes it is possible.	Rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva byose
This is no problem.	Ibi nta kibazo.
He wanted what he had.	Yashakaga ibyo yari afite.
I need help.	Ndashaka ubufasha.
I should have tried harder	Nari nkwiye kugerageza cyane
I really appreciate your time	Nishimiye cyane umwanya wawe
I knew it was for me	Nari nzi ko aribyo kuri njye
It was really nice to see.	Byari byiza rwose kubona.
You like to live.	Ukunda kubaho.
I need to know where you are at all times	Nkeneye kumenya aho uri igihe cyose
About yes.	Hafi ya.
In fact, they are scared.	Mubyukuri, bafite ubwoba.
I want to hear more	Ndashaka kumva byinshi
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I have my family.	Mfite umuryango wanjye.
I finally got a job and a place to live	Amaherezo nabonye akazi n'aho kuba
Obviously he can never do that	Biragaragara ko adashobora na rimwe kubikora
There is one thing to say.	Hariho ikintu kimwe cyo kuvuga.
I can never hear again	Sinshobora kongera kumva
He was not.	Ntiyari.
Obviously that.	Biragaragara ko ibyo.
I thought in the end everything was fine	Natekereje ko amaherezo ibintu byose ari byiza
I didn't know it was hard	Sinari nzi ko bigoye
I want to try it with you	Ndashaka kugerageza nawe
That's right.	Nibyo.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
He seems to be listening.	Asa naho yumva.
I didn't want to look bad	Sinifuzaga kureba neza
They were both right.	Bombi bari bafite ukuri.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He knew he would do it.	Yari azi ko azabikora.
I'm not going.	Ntabwo ngiye.
I don't know what to do.	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora.
We are just human beings.	Turi abantu gusa.
Whether at home or away.	Yaba murugo cyangwa kure.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
I can do things.	Nshobora gukora ibintu.
I doubt you need to do anything.	Ndashidikanya ko ukeneye gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
I really want one of those	Ndashaka rwose kimwe muri ibyo
I think that's true	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri
But today is a good day.	Ariko uyu munsi ni mwiza.
He knew everyone.	Yari azi abantu bose.
I am not a good tennis player	Ntabwo ndi umukinnyi mwiza wa tennis
I never felt like drinking.	Sinigeze numva nshaka kunywa.
He said he chose not to do so.	Yavuze ko yahisemo kutabikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I'm glad this happened	Nishimiye ibi
He feels nothing.	Nta cyo yumva.
He knew he would be there.	Yari azi ko azaba ahari.
I am very happy to do so	Nishimiye cyane kubikora
He is a really good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza rwose.
I was thinking of watching a movie	Natekerezaga kureba firime
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
I don't know what to do.	Ntazi icyo akora.
I was not his wife.	Ntabwo nari umugore we.
He has help here.	Hano afite ubufasha.
Or even earlier.	Cyangwa mbere cyane.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
And you're going to have to find what you want.	Kandi ugiye kujya gushaka icyo ushaka.
We must have faith.	Tugomba kugira kwizera.
I was not sure what he was talking about.	Sinari nzi neza ibyo avuga.
I want this.	Ndashaka ibi.
I can eat nothing	Ntacyo nshobora kurya
What he did.	Ibyo yakoze.
But you are the same.	Ariko nawe uri umwe.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
He could work.	Yashoboraga gukora.
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
I am a very good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza cyane.
But it was good for me.	Ariko byari byiza kuri njye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I was afraid to go down	Nari mfite ubwoba bwo kujya hasi
You know that day.	Uzi uwo munsi.
We were behind.	Twari inyuma.
I shouldn't be here with you like that	Ntabwo nkwiye kuba hano hamwe nawe gutya
I wanted to be me.	Nari nashakaga kuba njye.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu ni byiza cyane.
I wanted to do something else	Nashakaga gukora ikindi kintu
And that was good.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza.
They didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo bari bazi icyo.
I think that's good.	Ndakeka yuko ibyo ari byiza.
Or maybe it was too much.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko byari byinshi cyane.
And so it is.	Na we ni uko.
I'm really good	Ndi mwiza rwose.
I was so beautiful.	Nari mwiza cyane.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
They are scared.	Bafite ubwoba.
I don't know a guy	Ntabwo nzi umusore
I was going a long way	Nari ngiye kure
Probably.	Birashoboka.
You have to do what you have to do.	Ugomba gukora ibyo ugomba.
I can't do this	Sinshobora gukora ibi
Obviously there is a lot to think about.	Biragaragara ko hari byinshi byo gutekereza kuri ibi.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
He was that.	Yari uwo.
You may want to check it out.	Urashobora gushaka kureba.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I don't know why.	Ntazi impamvu.
I know exactly where he went	Nzi neza aho yagiye
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri yo.
I have a job to do	Mfite akazi nkora
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
That.	Icyo.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
Congratulations to everyone	Nishimiye abantu bose
I'm ashamed.	Mfite isoni.
I suspect he is in his house	Ndakeka ko ari mu nzu ye
He was not out.	Ntiyari hanze.
He asked a question.	Yabajije ikibazo.
We don’t need his money.	Ntabwo dukeneye amafaranga ye.
But it looks very similar.	Ariko birasa cyane.
I can't even imagine doing it	Sinshobora no gutekereza kubikora
I needed the truth.	Nari nkeneye ukuri.
But it is good.	Ariko ni mwiza.
And that's really cool.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza rwose.
Leaving a woman alone.	Kureka umugore wenyine.
I shouldn’t have looked	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kureba
I can't think of food	Sinshobora gutekereza kurya
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
I know exactly who he is	Nzi neza uwo ari we
I was not sure when.	Sinari nzi neza igihe icyo ari cyo.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
I really think we should talk	Ndatekereza rwose ko tugomba kuvuga
You have to know people.	Ugomba kumenya abantu.
This was the best thing he had ever done.	Ibi byari ibintu byiza cyane yigeze agira.
That's me	Uwo ni njye.
I should have talked to you	Nari nkwiye kuvugana nawe
I think in fact both are true.	Ntekereza ko mubyukuri bombi ari ukuri.
For me it is a good thing.	Kuri njye ni ikintu cyiza.
I have my phone	Mfite terefone yanjye
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I didn’t need to stay with him	Sinari nkeneye kuguma hamwe na we
He loved dogs.	Yakundaga imbwa.
I was where he was	Nari aho yari ari
He asked for help.	Yasabye ubufasha.
Why can't he wait.	Kuki adashobora gutegereza.
No need to look.	Nta mpamvu yo kureba.
He wanted nothing.	Nta cyo yashakaga.
Here it is.	Ndi iki.
I mean, it wasn’t just me	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo yari njye gusa
You did it.	Wabikoze.
She was my wife, she was not his wife.	Yari umugore wanjye, ntabwo yari umugore we.
I'm not sure what to do.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo gukora.
Today, there is a problem.	Uyu munsi, hari ikibazo.
He was not going to back down.	Ntabwo yari agiye gusubira inyuma.
He did well on his own.	Yakoze neza wenyine.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I don't want to wait.	Sinshaka gutegereza.
It's good to have problems.	Nibyiza kugira ibibazo.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
It is very good and good.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byiza.
I was good to go	Nari mwiza kugenda
I can do things now	Nshobora gukora ibintu ubu
I hope we have time.	Nizere ko dufite umwanya.
It was a great experience	Byari ibintu byiza cyane
I want to know more.	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
It's not a day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi.
I have nothing for him	Nta kintu mfite kuri we
I never thought about what to do next	Sinigeze ntekereza icyo gukora nyuma
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
I never wanted to be one.	Sinigeze nshaka kuba umwe.
I like hearing	Nkunda kumva
I knew he had the same feelings	Nari nzi ko yumva ibintu kimwe
I love time for me	Nkunda umwanya kuri njye
I am so happy to be here	Nishimiye cyane kuba ndi hano
I thought you might be.	Natekereje ko ushobora kuba.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
You need to work harder.	Ukeneye gukora cyane.
What is it?	Ni iki?
I really want to do it	Ndashaka rwose kubikora
But he said nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yavuze.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I always think	Ntekereza buri gihe
What did his father ask?	Se yabajije iki.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I like the way it speaks	Nkunda uburyo bwo kuvuga
I didn't know that before	Sinari nzi icyo kintu mbere
I do not.	Ntabwo nkora.
I don't have that problem.	Ntabwo mfite icyo kibazo.
This one should be close again.	Uyu agomba kongera kuba hafi.
I didn't know when	Ntabwo nari nzi igihe
I knew it was not good for me	Nari nzi ko atari mwiza kuri njye
You can go now.	Urashobora kugenda ubu.
Everyone.	Umuntu wese.
See if you are really getting the best out of it.	Kureba niba mubyukuri urimo kubona ibintu byiza.
We have to say it again tomorrow.	Tugomba kongera kuvuga ejo.
I just want to be your friend	Ndashaka kuba inshuti yawe gusa
More and more and more movies.	Byinshi kandi byinshi hamwe na firime nyinshi.
You have until now tomorrow.	Ufite kugeza iki gihe ejo.
That was the last bus.	Iyo yari bisi ya nyuma.
I don't know if you can do it.	Sinzi niba ushobora kubikora.
I want the truth.	Ndashaka ukuri.
But here is the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo.
He says he wants to talk to you.	Avuga ko ashaka kuvugana nawe.
He never did.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora.
I don't know what it is	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo
I have never done anything wrong.	Nta kintu kibi nigeze nkora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
I want to see how they are, now.	Ndashaka kureba uko bari, ubu.
She never had a baby	Ntiyigeze agira umwana
He could work in that world.	Yashoboraga gukora muri iyo si.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
It was close.	Byari hafi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Really you.	Nukuri wowe.
There are a lot of people inside.	Imbere hari abantu benshi.
Probably not	Birashoboka ko ntagomba
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
I thought you could only live one day	Natekerezaga ko ushobora kubaho umunsi umwe wenyine
There is.	Hariho.
I heard he came after me	Numvise ko yaje inyuma yanjye
I wanted to see if you were doing well	Nashakaga kureba niba ukora neza
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
I just need to know how	Nkeneye gusa kumenya uko
That's right.	Ibyo ni byo.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
I can't understand what you mean, really.	Ntabwo nshobora kumva icyo ushaka kuvuga, mubyukuri.
I'm glad that	Nishimiye ibyo
I was just a girl.	Nari umukobwa gusa.
I thought for a while but I couldn't think of anything	Natekereje gato ariko sinshobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe
Maybe we should do it.	Ahari tugomba kubikora.
I really don't know how to do it.	Sinzi rwose kubikora.
I like to live alone	Nkunda kubaho wenyine
I can take this too far	Nshobora gufata ibi kure cyane
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
Ahari.	Ahari.
I'm sure I want to go back	Nzi neza ko nshaka gusubira inyuma
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko atigeze abikora.
He is leaving.	Arimo kugenda.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Only.	Gusa.
Probably not my daughter.	Birashoboka ko atari umukobwa wanjye.
I mean, that’s not it	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo aribyo
I wanted to be with him	Nashakaga kubana na we
For me.	Kuri njye.
I never thought about that	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo
I think it will be good	Ntekereza ko bizaba byiza
I got everything you need	Nabonye ibyo ukeneye byose
.	.
You are not sure if that is the case.	Ntabwo uzi neza niba aribyo.
I knew then.	Icyo gihe nari nzi.
I can definitely do that	Nshobora kubikora rwose
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
I was not in the room	Sinari mu cyumba
You can find out why.	Urashobora kubona impamvu.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba gushaka rwose gukora ikintu.
She is very worried about him.	Afite impungenge cyane kuri we ari hafi ye.
Not good enough.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
I was going to take time off	Nari ngiye gufata umwanya wo kugenda
I don't know what it is.	Ntazi icyo aricyo.
No one can do that.	Nta muntu n'umwe ushobora kubikora.
He has a problem.	Afite ikibazo.
He thought it was not true.	Yatekereje ko atari ukuri.
Lots of shopping.	Ibintu byinshi byo kugura.
He is a very nice person.	Ni umuntu mwiza cyane.
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I want to play with you	Ndashaka gukina nawe
I knew it was not true	Nari nzi ko atari ukuri
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
But he is not.	Ariko we sibyo.
As we all are.	Nkuko twese turi.
I really have.	Nukuri mfite.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I just need time to think	Nkeneye gusa igihe cyo gutekereza
That's what he told me.	Nibyo yambwiye.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
He has to act fast.	Agomba gukora vuba.
But knowing is the same thing.	Ariko kumenya ni ikintu kimwe.
But that was under him	Ariko ibyo byari munsi ye
I was about to leave school.	Nari hafi kuva ku ishuri.
He was now in me.	Ubu yari muri njye.
Maybe you are.	Birashoboka ko uri.
I have a lot of problems coming later	Mfite ibibazo byinshi byo kuza nyuma
His family.	Umuryango we.
He thought of her	Yatekereje kuri we
Really, really good.	Nukuri, nibyiza rwose.
I don't really need it	Ntabwo nkeneye rwose
I was looking for a baby	Nashakaga umwana
Not good for him today.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri we uyu munsi.
For him.	Kuri we.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
It can't be bad.	Ntashobora kuba mubi.
All they have is money.	Ibyo bafite byose ni amafaranga.
He doesn't seem to mind.	Ntabwo asa naho atekereza.
I had nothing to go back to	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo gusubira inyuma
I was sure it was true	Nari nzi neza ko ari ukuri
I feel good about that.	Ndumva ari byiza kuri ibyo.
I don't know, I really don't know	Ntacyo nzi, mubyukuri ntacyo nzi
I should give up	Nkwiye kureka ibintu
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I know someone who knows this person	Nzi umuntu uzi uyu muntu
So much so, that it is possible.	Byinshi cyane, birashoboka.
I ask why.	Ndabaza impamvu.
I was not sure what to do about it.	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora kuri ibyo.
I should play better than this	Nkwiye gukina neza kurenza ibi
You said it was wrong.	Wavuze ko atari byo.
I knew it from the beginning.	Nari nzi kuva mbere.
It would go well.	Byari kugenda neza.
Everyone knew his gift.	Buri wese yamenye impano ye.
You can ask to find out why.	Urashobora gusaba kumenya impamvu.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I heard something in him	Numvise ikintu muri we
It was not.	Ntabwo byari.
It's good for these.	Ni mwiza kuri aba.
I thought it would be great to tell you that	Natekereje ko ari mwiza cyane kumbwira ibyo
I'm glad to do that	Nishimiye kubikora
All this.	Ibi byose.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
I needed to stay current	Nari nkeneye kuguma muri iki gihe
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo sibyo.
I never wanted one of those	Sinigeze nshaka kimwe muri ibyo
It would be a good movie.	Byaba firime nziza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari.
I never heard of that	Sinigeze numva ibyo
It would be normal for him.	Byaba bisanzwe kuri we.
I think that's what he meant	Ntekereza ko aribyo yashakaga kuvuga
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
Let your hair down.	Reka umusatsi wawe hasi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I ask where they are	Ndabaza aho bari
I don't know where your dog is	Ntabwo nzi aho imbwa yawe iri
I really am not.	Ntabwo rwose ndi.
You can't ask for anything else.	Ntushobora gusaba ikindi kintu.
He really knew how to do things.	Yari azi rwose gukora ibintu.
The only problem is when.	Ikibazo gusa ni ryari.
It is something else.	Ni ikindi kintu.
I just thought you were beautiful	Gusa natekerezaga ko uri mwiza
You can do it.	Ushobora kubikora.
You did it.	Wabikoze.
He meant tomorrow.	Yashakaga kuvuga ejo.
This is later.	Ibi ni nyuma.
It's not you, my dear.	Ntabwo ari wowe, nyamuneka.
But it was a wonderful experience.	Ariko byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I'm not good enough	Ntabwo ndi mwiza bihagije.
I want to be close to you	Ndashaka kuba hafi yawe
He actually did a lot of that.	Mubyukuri yakoze byinshi kuri ibyo.
I had.	Nari mfite.
He is far away.	Ari kure.
I have to think at all	Ngomba gutekereza na gato
I'm really glad to be here tonight	Nishimiye rwose kuba nshobora kuza hano iri joro
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
But things are getting worse.	Ariko ibintu biragaragara ko bigoye kuruta ibyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I don't want to go fast.	Ntashaka kugenda vuba.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
Many are possible.	Benshi birashoboka.
He wants to be clear.	Arashaka kuvuga neza.
We have nothing to eat.	Ntacyo dufite cyo kurya.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo ari cyo.
I haven't seen anyone in a long time.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona umuntu igihe kinini.
It was under him.	Yari munsi ye.
I'm glad this happened	Nishimiye ibi
Not your son.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu wawe.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
His father was a teacher.	Se yari umwarimu.
I can't stay home today	Sinshobora kuguma murugo uyu munsi
And here he was.	Kandi hano yari.
He is not very young.	Ntabwo akiri muto cyane.
I knew it was not my fault	Nari nzi ko atari amakosa yanjye
He looked outside.	Yarebye neza hanze.
You should have heard.	Wari ukwiye kumva.
I wanted to talk in prison	Nashakaga kuvuga muri gereza
But you did it early.	Ariko wabikoze kare.
I knew what had happened	Nari nzi uko byagenze
I never wanted any of that	Sinigeze nshaka na kimwe muri byo
None of this is good.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari cyiza.
Your whole family is.	Umuryango wawe wose ni.
To have people.	Kugira abantu.
But it is not close	Ariko ntabwo ari hafi
In fact, it is.	Mubyukuri, nibyo.
I enjoy helping people	Nishimiye gufasha abantu
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He looked away.	Yarebye kure.
He is my age.	Afite imyaka yanjye.
I understand exactly what you mean	Ndumva neza icyo ushaka kuvuga
He said he desperately needed money.	Yavuze ko yari akeneye amafaranga cyane.
I feel very close	Ndumva ari hafi cyane
You can absolutely do it.	Urashobora kubikora rwose.
Especially for him.	Cyane cyane kuri we.
I was well aware	Nari nzi neza
Or anyone.	Cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese.
We have to.	Tugomba.
I guess it's probably my fault	Ndakeka ko bishoboka ko ari amakosa yanjye
I'm really good.	Mubyukuri ndi mwiza cyane.
I have never heard him speak before	Sinigeze numva avuga mbere
He had many friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni igitekerezo gusa.
I need to do it alone	Nkeneye kubikora wenyine
And they have, so far.	Kandi bafite, kugeza ubu.
You can do it too.	Urashobora no kubikora.
I don't know if that is possible	Sinzi niba ibyo bishoboka
It will be around for a long time.	Bizaba hafi igihe kinini.
You have to be.	Ugomba kuba.
I think that's enough for today	Ndakeka ko ibyo bihagije kuri uyumunsi
I just can't think of anything else to do	Gusa sinshobora gutekereza gukora ikindi kintu
I can't believe he told me this	Sinshobora kwizera ko yambwiye ibi
I need to work here.	Nkeneye gukora hano.
I also had it in school	Nanjye nari mfite mu ishuri
But there is something else.	Ariko hari ikindi kintu.
He didn't have much.	Ntabwo yari afite byinshi.
I knew who he was	Nari nzi uwo ari we
I saw someone in front of me.	Nabonye umuntu imbere yanjye.
I had a lot to catch	Nari mfite byinshi byo gufata
He has to do it.	Agomba kubikora.
Everything was great.	Byose byari byiza cyane.
You can go back here.	Urashobora gusubira hano.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
He did nothing, obviously.	Ntacyo yakoze, biragaragara.
I can't talk or eat.	Sinshobora kuvuga cyangwa kurya.
I think he is.	Ntekereza ko ari.
You don't have to stay here.	Ntagomba kuguma hano.
But obviously not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari byo.
Food for thought.	Ibiryo byo gutekereza.
It was a family.	Ryari umuryango.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
At that point, there is nothing you can do about it.	Muri icyo gihe, nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora.
I guess he's one of us, right now	Ndakeka ko ari umwe muri twe, ubu
I hope everything is fine	Nizere ko byose ari byiza
Just a problem.	Gusa ikibazo.
He went to talk to you.	Yagiye kuvugana nawe.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I didn't need to.	Sinari nkeneye.
I never wanted anything	Sinigeze nshaka ikintu na kimwe
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I can't even say for sure that he ever did this	Sinshobora no kumenya neza ko yigeze agira ibi
You were just a kid.	Wari umwana gusa.
This one would work.	Uyu yari gukora.
He had people.	Yari afite abantu.
You were alone.	Wari wenyine.
That's what happened then.	Kuva icyo gihe ni ko byagenze.
I was.	Nari njye.
It would be nice to have children.	Byari kuba byiza kubana.
I didn't have to go	Sinari nkwiye kugenda
We.	Ni.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora gukora uburyo.
I just can't believe all this, that's all	Gusa sinshobora kwizera ibi byose, nibyo byose
You can never.	Ntushobora na rimwe.
We need to find time.	Tugomba kubona umwanya.
I definitely should go home	Nkwiye rwose gusubira murugo
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
I can't think of anything like that	Sinshobora gutekereza gutya
If not, it is not.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo.
I like my car.	Nkunda imodoka yanjye.
You know how to do this.	Uzi gukora ibi.
I think that is possible	Ndakeka ko ibyo bishoboka
I should go.	Nkwiye kugenda.
Hair is possible.	Umusatsi birashoboka.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I thought a lot about myself	Natekereje cyane kuri njye
I needed that.	Nari nkeneye ibyo.
I thought it was.	Natekereje ko ari.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
The car started moving.	Imodoka yatangiye kugenda.
He wanted to help.	Yashakaga gufasha.
I was happy about that	Nari nishimiye ibyo
I can't do this	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ibi
I thought it was a good idea.	Natekereje ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
Find out more about her.	Gushaka byinshi kuri we.
Glad to see her behind.	Nishimiye kubona inyuma ye.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I really felt bad	Nukuri numvise nabi
But man is too much.	Ariko umuntu ni byinshi cyane.
Do you mean 	Urashaka kuvuga?
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
Or you can have more.	Cyangwa urashobora kugira byinshi.
You know why we're here.	Uzi impamvu turi hano.
It was a great time.	Wari umwanya mwiza.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
But the problem is us.	Ariko ikibazo ni twe.
I was a girl.	Nari umukobwa.
I'm glad it's there.	Nishimiye ko ahari.
Who can help.	Ninde ushobora gufasha.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
She was just a girl.	Yari umukobwa gusa.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Wisdom.	Ubwenge.
But maybe not bad.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari mubi.
I did everything	Nakoze byose
You know who you are.	Uzi uwo uri we.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
There are many problems.	Hariho ibibazo byinshi.
Apparently he had a problem.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ikibazo.
I think you should think about getting it	Ndatekereza ko ugomba gutekereza kubona
But he wants more.	Ariko arashaka byinshi.
He did a lot.	Yakoze cyane.
Everyone knows enough about him.	Umuntu wese azi bihagije kuri we.
I don’t think this is a good idea	Ntekereza ko iki atari igitekerezo cyiza
And no.	Kandi ntabwo.
Sometimes you are in the front, sometimes you are in the back.	Rimwe na rimwe uri imbere, rimwe na rimwe uri inyuma.
I want to see if he is gone	Ndashaka kubona ko yagiye
But you know that.	Ariko uzi ko aribyo.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
And he probably can't.	Kandi birashoboka ko adashobora kubikora.
Come on. 	Hasi.
'	'
You can do it !!.	Urashobora kubikora !!.
That’s fine here, really.	Nibyiza hano, mubyukuri.
It was just an idea.	Byari igitekerezo gusa.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I have a lot	Mfite byinshi
I can't see anything about it	Sinshobora kubona ikintu na kimwe kuri yo
I'm glad he didn't	Nishimiye ko atabikoze
It will not be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza.
He is happy to be here.	Yishimiye kuba hano.
And he looked like me.	Kandi yasaga nkanjye.
I think he is very much in me	Ndakeka ko ari muri njye cyane
She was a beautiful woman inside and out.	Yari umugore mwiza cyane imbere no hanze.
I'm going to talk to you.	Ngiye kuvugana nawe.
This house is your home.	Iyi nzu ni inzu yawe.
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
I wouldn’t think he was a bad person	Ntabwo nari gutekereza ko ari umuntu mubi
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
I can't say much right now	Sinshobora kuvuga byinshi kuri ubu
You have no house.	Nta nzu ufite.
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
I knew what he was thinking	Nari nzi icyo atekereza
I was going to do things and be human	Nari ngiye gukora ibintu no kuba umuntu
It's one day.	Ni umunsi umwe.
At least for a while.	Kuri ariko gito gito mugihe.
But he did not choose.	Ariko ntabwo yahisemo.
I make a mistake	Nkora amakosa
Years ago.	Imyaka mbere.
I was not sure if this was possible	Sinari nzi neza niba bishoboka
He has what he told me.	Afite ibyo yambwiye.
I am very happy	Nishimiye cyane
Shortly afterwards, he heard a car outside	Nyuma gato, yumvise imodoka hanze
Now, we need to go.	Ubu, dukeneye kugenda.
While at work.	Igihe yari mu kazi.
It’s not just the years.	Ntabwo ari imyaka gusa.
He said he did not know for sure.	Yavuze ko atari azi neza.
You that morning.	Wowe muri icyo gitondo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I can never trust anyone again	Sinshobora kongera kwizera umuntu
It started now.	Yatangiye ubu.
At that point I had to go	Icyo gihe nari nkwiye kugenda
To, and to, and to.	Kuri, no kuri, no ku.
If you knew what you were doing.	Niba wari uzi icyo ukora.
But I tell you a lot about it.	Ariko mbwira byinshi kuri byo.
I'm sure that	Nzi neza ko ibyo
I think I'm more scared than anything	Ntekereza ko mfite ubwoba kuruta ikindi kintu cyose
I believe in faith.	Nizera kwizera.
Almost everyone.	Hafi ya bose.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
Probably a movie.	Birashoboka ko hariho firime.
He thought he should.	Yatekereje ko agomba.
And you can be !.	Kandi urashobora kuba!.
I was not here, but my wife was	Ntabwo nari hano, ariko umugore wanjye yari
I was sure he was	Nari nzi neza ko ari we
You've got to stop this.	Wabonye guhagarika ibi.
I hope to work hard.	Nizera gukora cyane.
Being something.	Kuba ikintu.
And her hair is really beautiful.	Kandi umusatsi we rwose ni mwiza.
I meant	Nashakaga kuvuga
Tomorrow would be thirty.	Ejo byaba mirongo itatu.
I thought it was a good idea	Natekereje ko ari igitekerezo cyiza
I know he does.	Nzi ko abikora.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
You are not sure how or why.	Ntabwo uzi neza uburyo cyangwa impamvu.
I think he can help	Ntekereza ko ashobora gufasha
I needed a book yesterday	Nari nkeneye igitabo ejo
I understand what you are up to	Ndumva kubyo urimo
He has a job.	Afite akazi.
You have to go now.	Ugomba kugenda ubu.
I'm not sure the problem, here.	Sinzi neza ikibazo, hano.
I had nothing for him	Ntacyo nari mfite kuri we
I am smart.	Ndi ubwenge.
I'm so glad you love this world	Nishimiye cyane ko ukunda iyi si
I can't do that	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora
He seemed to think about what he would read.	Yasaga naho atekereza kubyo yari gusoma.
Where do you want to go first ?.	Urashaka kujya mbere he?.
He wanted the truth.	Yashakaga ukuri.
I hear nothing about him and I have never heard of him	Ntacyo numva kuri we kandi sinigeze numva
He didn’t even want to think.	Ntiyashakaga no gutekereza.
I think everything is fine	Ntekereza ko byose ari byiza
I should have been one	Nari nkwiye kuba umwe
Sometimes there is more.	Rimwe na rimwe hari byinshi.
I never thought of anything	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza ikintu na kimwe
But he would have another problem.	Ariko yari kugira ikindi kibazo.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
You have to see this.	Ugomba kubona ibi.
I wanted it for me all the time	Nashakaga kuri njye igihe cyose
I'm not sure what that is.  	Sinzi neza icyo aricyo.  
But of course not.	Ariko rwose sibyo.
I want to know the truth about myself	Ndashaka kumenya ukuri kuri njye
But he is a child.	Ariko ni umwana.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu.
However, this is not always a good idea.	Ariko, ntabwo buri gihe ari inama nziza.
Who is a good person	Ninde muntu mwiza.
He can do whatever he wants.	Arashobora gukora icyo ashaka.
He did not ask much about this.	Ntabwo yabajije byinshi kuri ibi.
I was really good	Nari mwiza rwose
He could have been better off if he wanted to be.	Ashobora kuba mwiza iyo yashakaga kuba.
You can never be too early.	Ntushobora na rimwe kuba kare cyane.
I can't figure out where it is	Sinshobora kumenya neza aho ari
Either way, he should try.	Ibyo ari byo byose, agomba kugerageza.
Nothing.	Ntacyo.
I know what he's up to	Nzi icyo arimo
He was not dressed.	Ntiyari yambaye imyenda.
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I shouldn't be here	Ntabwo nkwiye kuba hano
I knew nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi
It was not a school.	Ntabwo yari ishuri.
We have nothing against him.	Nta kintu na kimwe dufite kuri we.
Everyone was outside.	Abantu bose bari hanze.
I really wanted to know what he was thinking	Nashakaga cyane kumenya icyo atekereza
I have to tell someone.	Ngomba kubwira umuntu.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
But that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ariko ibyo ni byo kuri ubu.
He has to do it later.	Agomba kubikora nyuma.
I want to see what he can do.	Ndashaka kureba icyo ashobora gukora.
Anything you like.	Ikintu cyose ukunda.
I mean he was my son	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yari umuhungu wanjye
He has to be scared.	Agomba kugira ubwoba.
They knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Bari bazi ko na we yabikoze.
All day long, it is.	Umunsi wose, uri.
But that is exactly what he meant.	Ariko ibyo nibyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He needed to drink.	Yari akeneye kunywa.
I really think you should try	Ndatekereza rwose ko ugomba kugerageza
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri
We have a lot to do.	Dufite byinshi byo gukora.
We would go ahead.	Twari kujya imbere.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
I didn't know what happened	Sinari nzi uko byagenze
I believe that is true	Ndizera ko ibyo ari ukuri
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato igihe gito.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
I thought it was great	Natekereje ko ari nziza cyane
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
Good inside.	Byiza imbere.
Most of the time you do this.	Igihe kinini ukora ibi.
There is a problem for me.	Hariho ikibazo kuri njye.
I love my baby, time.	Nkunda umwana wanjye, igihe.
I want you to do whatever you want	Ndashaka ko ukora icyo ushaka cyose
People here.	Abantu hano.
I am, after all, close to him	Njye, nyuma ya byose, hafi ye
I'm not sure what happened.	Ntabwo nzi neza uko byagenze kuri ibyo.
What we have.	Ibyo dufite.
Being there.	Kuba ahari.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I knew he was worried	Nari nzi ko afite impungenge
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza kuri ibyo.
He did all this on his own.	Ibyo byose yabikoze wenyine.
I knew it was him	Nari nzi ko ari we
Doing good things.	Gukora ibintu byiza.
I needed money.	Nari nkeneye amafaranga.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I didn't have that	Ntabwo nari mfite ibyo
I said I didn't know why	Nagize ngo ntazi impamvu
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
I can't see who he is	Sinshobora kubona uwo ari we
I have a daughter.	Mfite umukobwa.
He is on the phone.	Ari kuri terefone.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
I want to be away then.	Ndashaka kuba kure icyo gihe.
I need advice, badly	Nkeneye inama, nabi
I didn’t do much after eating	Ntabwo nakoze byinshi nyuma yo kurya
Long time no see.	Igihe kirekire, kirekire.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
I can't see how he could have lived	Sinshobora kubona uko yashoboraga kubaho
I have to do it	Ngomba kubikora
Me.	Njye.
I had no reason to be ashamed	Nta mpamvu nari mfite yo kugira isoni
I can't find anything wrong here	Sinshobora kubona ikintu kibi hano
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I knew what he was thinking	Nari nzi icyo atekereza
Everyone had a place to live.	Umuntu wese yari afite aho agomba kuba.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
I don't want to do that	Sinshaka kubikora
He told me things.	Yambwiye ibintu.
In fact it is the same and the same.	Mubyukuri ni kimwe kandi kimwe.
My young man.	Umusore wanjye muto.
I mean, you can't win	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntushobora gutsinda
He wanted to talk to her.	Yashakaga kuvugana na we.
I did nothing wrong	Nta kibi nakoze
I didn't need help	Ntabwo nari nkeneye ubufasha
I had nothing here	Ntacyo nari mfite hano
I don't know what it is	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I know you have to go.	Nzi ko ugomba kugenda.
I wanted you in me now	Nashakaga ko muri njye ubu
But in the end.	Ariko amaherezo.
I guess we just have to get married	Ndakeka ko tugomba gushaka gusa
It’s not the same as before, however.	Ntabwo ari nka mbere, ariko.
I didn’t get a chance to be scared	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kugira ubwoba
Prison.	Gereza.
I ask only one thing	Ndabaza ikintu kimwe gusa
He went ahead of her.	Yagiye imbere ye.
But here is the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo.
I want to know where you are so far	Ndashaka kumenya aho wari uri kugeza ubu
He thinks that is true.	Yibwira ko ibyo ari ukuri.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
That's right- this is not about us.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari ikibazo kuri twe.
I mean really	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri
I have to see things	Ngomba kuba mbona ibintu
I knew they were close.	Nari nzi ko bari hafi.
Everything went wrong.	Ibintu byose byagenze nabi.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
And we had.	Kandi twari dufite.
I need help with that	Nkeneye ubufasha kuri ibyo
I want to do things	Ndashaka gukora ibintu
You have children.	Ufite abana.
I want to learn more	Ndashaka kwiga byinshi
I don't know what to do.	Ntazi icyo akora.
Or something else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu.
I found it unhealthy from the beginning	Nabonye atari mwiza kuva mbere
This is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibi.
I am one.	Ndi umwe.
I hope she is still fine	Nizere ko akiri mwiza
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
I don’t think that’s a good idea at the moment	Ntekereza ko icyo atari igitekerezo cyiza muri iki gihe
I just thought it would be nice	Gusa natekereje ko byaba byiza
I was going to go, and that's it	Nari ngiye kugenda, kandi nibyo
I feel like you have a wife	Ndumva ufite umugore
Or, more importantly, how.	Cyangwa cyane cyane, uburyo.
It was hard to watch.	Byari bigoye kureba.
I needed to see it here	Nari nkeneye kubona hano
I'm glad that.	Nishimiye ibyo.
I should go home.	Nkwiye gutaha.
Probably a boy.	Birashoboka ko umuhungu.
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
Not available.	Ntabwo ahari.
I have my family here	Mfite umuryango wanjye hano
I am not at home, this is not at home.	Ntabwo ndi murugo, iyi ntabwo ari murugo.
It's good inside.	Nibyiza imbere.
I didn't know why	Sinari nzi impamvu
He was a good child.	Yari umwana mwiza.
The teacher is actually	Umwarimu mubyukuri
He was good at that.	Yari mwiza kuri ibyo.
That is not a good thing.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
I know what it is.	Nzi icyo aricyo.
I want to quit my job	Ndashaka kureka akazi
I think he is.	Ntekereza ko ari we.
I want to stay here for a while	Ndashaka kuguma hano umwanya muto
This house is mine.	Iyi nzu ni njye.
I'm glad you have	Nishimiye ko ufite
He is not a bad person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mubi.
Not fast, but in the end.	Ntabwo ari vuba, ariko amaherezo.
He can't stay away.	Ntashobora kuguma kure.
I can't look at this again	Sinshobora kongera kureba ibi
And he has to be.	Kandi agomba kuba.
I just have time	Mfite umwanya gusa
I don't want to go.	Sinshaka kugenda.
The woman came to where I was	Umugore yaje aho ndi
A beautiful girl like her.	Umukobwa mwiza nka we.
I'm not sure why	Sinzi neza impamvu ibyo aribyo
You can really do everything.	Urashobora rwose gukora ibintu byose.
Until then, everything is fine.	Kugeza icyo gihe, ibintu byose ni byiza.
Looks like money can win everything.	Birasa nkaho amafaranga ashobora gutsinda byose.
I always feel loved	Buri gihe numva nkunda
In his house.	Mu nzu ye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I think this whole thing is a good idea	Ntekereza ko iki kintu cyose ari igitekerezo cyiza
Not just me, my whole family.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa, umuryango wanjye wose.
I just didn't see it.	Gusa sinigeze mbona.
Obviously he can’t be his friend	Biragaragara ko ntashobora kuba inshuti ye
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
I never saw your wife.	Sinigeze mbona umugore wawe.
I was very embarrassed	Nagize isoni cyane
And not only that.	Kandi si ibyo gusa.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
I have to stop this	Ngomba guhagarika ibi
I really hope you can do that	Ndizera rwose ko ushobora kubikora
To do so.	Kubikora.
I can't live like that	Sinshobora kubaho gutya
I was not sure what happened for the first time	Sinari nzi neza uko byagenze bwa mbere
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
He loved it here.	Yakundaga hano.
At the time of purchase.	Mugihe cyo kugura.
I didn't know what happened	Sinari kumenya uko byagenze
I thought that was what you wanted	Natekereje ko aricyo ushaka
I don't know what to think.	Sinzi icyo ntekereza.
I want to learn as much as possible	Ndashaka kwiga byinshi bishoboka
We need to get help.	Tugomba kubona ubufasha.
I needed to be with him.	Nari nkeneye kubana na we.
I have one of my own	Mfite umwe wanjye
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
Things are just fine.	Ibintu nibyiza gusa.
I have to try hard	Ngomba kugerageza cyane
He seems to have a lot of luck	Asa nkaho afite amahirwe menshi
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Absolutely.	Rwose.
You are my family.	Uri umuryango wanjye.
I didn't do anything good	Ntabwo nakoze ikintu cyiza
There is absolutely no reason to do so.	Nta mpamvu rwose yo kubikora.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko abikora.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
I know a little girl	Nzi umukobwa muto
I knew what he was thinking.	Nari nzi icyo atekereza.
He knew a lot.	Yari azi byinshi.
You are going to be beautiful.	Ugiye kuba mwiza.
I can't wait, really	Sinshobora gutegereza, mubyukuri
I wanted to win	Nashakaga gutsinda
That's all.	Nibyo gusa.
He did it today.	Uyu munsi yabikoze.
I was not sure if he really had it	Sinari nzi neza niba koko yari afite
And so it is.	Na we ni uko.
I mean, I felt bad	Ndashaka kuvuga ko numvise mubi
Absolutely.	Hariho rwose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I never wanted a bad person	Sinigeze nshaka umuntu mubi
They know full well that.	Bazi neza ko.
You can do wrong.	Urashobora gukora nabi.
He can wait, he has time.	Arashobora gutegereza, afite igihe.
I can’t take much of that	Sinshobora gufata byinshi muri byo
I had to do something about it	Nari ngomba kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
He was not behind you.	Ntiyari inyuma yawe.
He was the only one who saw it.	Umwe gusa ni we wabonye.
He had a lot.	Yari afite byinshi.
I only knew his father	Nari nzi gusa se
They never had one.	Ntabwo ari rimwe na rimwe bari bafite.
I feel nothing for him	Ntacyo numva kuri we
I wouldn't do it	Ntabwo nari kubikora
I'm worried.	Mfite impungenge.
I like to have a wife	Nkunda kugira umugore
It was hard to win.	Byari bigoye gutsinda.
I feel scared to go with you now	Ndumva mfite ubwoba bwo kujyana nawe ubu
I can't hear what he's saying	Sinshobora kumva ibyo avuga
I should not have come to school	Sinari nkwiye kuza ku ishuri
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose aribyo.
Niki.	Niki.
From there, you can help people.	Kuva aho, urashobora gufasha abantu.
I had a job.	Nari mfite akazi.
They weren't here tonight.	Ntabwo bari hano muri iri joro.
I needed to hear more	Nari nkeneye kumva byinshi
Are you looking for a good wife?	Urashaka umugore mwiza?.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
He could see the doers.	Yashoboraga kubona abikora.
It's you	Ni wowe.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
I doubt that is the case.	Ndashidikanya ko aribyo.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
Why, but that's it	Impamvu, ariko nibyo
Obviously we have nothing to say about what he said.	Biragaragara ko ntacyo dushobora kuvuga kubyo yavuze.
I know the truth.	Nzi ukuri.
I don't know where he is.	Sinzi aho ari.
He was looking for something.	Yashakaga ikintu.
I think it's good, we need to wait.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza, dukeneye gutegereza.
What each of us had.	Icyo buri wese muri twe yari afite.
'	'
They have a place here.	Bafite umwanya hano.
I know what it is.	Nzi icyo aricyo.
That's all.	Ibi byose nibyo.
This is the day.	Uyu ni umunsi.
That's if he was home.	Nibyo niba yari murugo.
He's gone now.	Yagiye ubu.
He could have seen a boy.	Yashoboraga kubona umuhungu.
Especially the food problem.	Cyane cyane ikibazo cyo kurya.
That thing is big.	Icyo kintu ni kinini.
I didn’t want him to be scared.	Sinifuzaga ko agira ubwoba.
This one was supposed to be his father.	Uyu yagombaga kuba se.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
I have to find a way to live	Ngomba gushaka uburyo bwo kubaho
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo rwose.
Maybe he can.	Ahari arashobora.
I was not sure what it was	Sinari nzi neza icyo aricyo
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo mbona neza.
I don't know what to say.	Ntazi icyo avuga.
I love being one every day	Nkunda buri munsi kuba umwe
I know someone.	Nzi umuntu.
He doesn't sit well with anyone here.	Ntabwo yicaye neza numuntu wese hano.
I had no plans	Nta gahunda nari mfite
I know this is not good for him.	Nzi ko ibi atari byiza kuri we.
It is a long way off, a success for us.	Ni kure cyane, kugenda neza kuri twe.
I have to take the opportunity.	Ngomba gufata amahirwe.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
I didn't know where you were	Sinari nzi aho uri
He heard nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yumvise.
He can do it with whatever he wants.	Arashobora kubikora hamwe nibyo ashaka.
I can't do that with you	Sinshobora kubikora nawe
He is just a man.	Ni umuntu gusa.
He has to do something.	Agomba kugira icyo akora.
But now he doesn't know for sure.	Ariko ubu ntabwo azi neza.
I was not very good	Ntabwo nari mwiza cyane
But a little.	Ariko gato.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva uko byagenze
I'm sorry about that	Mbabajwe nibyo
I didn't know what to do here.	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo gukora hano.
I never made new friends.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona inshuti nshya.
The day was beautiful.	Umunsi wari mwiza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ukuri kuri ubu.
I know what you think	Nzi icyo utekereza
I was going once	Nari ngiye rimwe
I have one of my own.	Mfite umwe wanjye.
A little thing.	Ikintu gito.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I just need money	Nkeneye amafaranga gusa
There is a lot of money.	Hariho amafaranga menshi.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
He didn't know enough about her.	Ntiyari azi bihagije kuri we.
I never saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona
I am very happy to buy	Nishimiye cyane kugura
Or maybe more.	Cyangwa ahari byinshi.
I didn't hear much	Ntabwo numvise byinshi
I didn't know what to believe	Sinari nzi icyo nizera
Just do it now.	Gusa gukora nonaha.
That's really good.	Nibyiza mubyukuri.
This is not very easy.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
I think we need money.	Ntekereza ko dukeneye amafaranga.
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki?.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Someone.	Umuntu.
You were the whole family.	Wari umuryango wose.
I know you can do work	Nzi ko ushobora gukora akazi
I know this is not true for everyone.	Nzi ko atari ukuri kuri buri wese.
I haven’t done much since	Kuva icyo gihe ntabwo nigeze nkora byinshi
I was looking for this time	Nashakaga iki gihe
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He has a job to do here.	Afite akazi ko gukora hano.
I need to know more about it	Ngomba kumenya byinshi kuri byo
We have to live together.	Tugomba kubana.
Why do you think this thing is so good?	Impamvu utekereza ko iki kintu aricyo cyiza.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
I know how you did it	Nzi uko wabikoze
I knew he would do it.	Nari nzi ko azabikora.
My house.	Inzu yanjye.
Things are good.	Ibintu ni byiza.
A lot around me.	Byinshi hafi yanjye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko nawe azabikora.
But you have faith.	Ariko ufite kwizera.
I am a young girl.	Ndi umukobwa muto.
I thought today was tomorrow	Natekereje ko uyu munsi ari ejo
I have to do something else	Ngomba gukora ikindi kintu
It was something.	Yari ikintu.
I think that's a good thing	Ntekereza ko icyo ari ikintu cyiza
I have a lot of problems.	Mfite ibibazo byinshi.
It looks, and is great.	Birasa, kandi ni byiza.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
I can't go far	Sinshobora kuva kure
He had already seen something.	Yari amaze kubona ikintu.
He has been there ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe yari ahari.
Nothing recently.	Nta na kimwe vuba aha.
Maybe one day we can go back.	Ahari umunsi umwe dushobora gusubira inyuma.
But not everyone has it easy.	Ariko ntabwo abantu bose bafite byoroshye.
I can't say the same thing tomorrow	Sinshobora kuvuga kimwe ejo
He knows they are scared.	Azi ko bafite ubwoba.
He wants to know if this is true.	Ashaka kumenya ko ari ukuri.
He had a little girl.	Yari afite umukobwa muto.
They probably had the truth.	Birashoboka ko bari bafite ukuri.
I know what it is	Nzi icyo aricyo
I have a lot of luck	Mfite amahirwe menshi
But that is clearly not the case.	Ariko ibyo biragaragara ko atari byo.
The girl looked very good.	Umukobwa yasaga neza cyane.
Maybe you can tell me.	Ahari ushobora kumbwira.
He did wrong.	Yagize nabi.
He needs to live.	Akeneye kubaho.
There are actually a lot of things.	Mubyukuri ibintu byinshi.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
He did the job.	Yakoze akazi.
Just a little girl.	Gusa umukobwa muto.
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza igihe.
I am a good child.	Ndi umwana mwiza.
I needed time to think, and to eat	Nari nkeneye umwanya wo gutekereza, no kurya
It won't be long.	Ntabwo azaba amaze igihe kinini.
I know exactly what you need	Nzi neza ibyo ukeneye
You can get a job.	Urashobora kubona akazi.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
It was very difficult to walk.	Kugenda byari bigoye rwose.
He chose to play after talking to his father	Yahisemo gukina nyuma yo kuvugana na se
You can't have too much.	Ntushobora kugira byinshi cyane.
If so, fine.	Niba aribyo, byiza.
All right.	Byose byiza.
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
Not every day.	Ntabwo buri munsi.
At work, it’s not down.	Ku kazi, ntabwo ari munsi.
It looks bad	Birasa nabi
My family was alone.	Umuryango wanjye wari wenyine.
I'm lucky.	Mfite amahirwe.
I knew exactly what he was going to do	Nari nzi neza icyo agiye gukora
This is definitely not the case.	Ibi rwose ntabwo aribyo.
And in fact, he didn't need it.	Kandi mubyukuri, ntabwo yari akeneye.
Today, it was work.	Uyu munsi, byari akazi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
I have a son.	Mfite umuhungu.
Really good.	Mubyukuri neza.
I think you need to be here	Ntekereza ko ukeneye kuba hano
Anyway.	Icyo aricyo cyose.
There is so much to see.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona.
You only need one person who knows how to do it.	Ukeneye umuntu umwe gusa uzi kubikora.
I have never been able to do that	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora gukora gutya
You may be down, but you are not out.	Urashobora kuba hasi, ariko ntabwo uri hanze.
I just knew it was.	Nari nzi gusa ko ari.
I'm worried about that.	Mfite impungenge kuri ibyo.
I need food now	Nkeneye ibiryo nonaha
He has his place.	Afite umwanya we.
I like to read books	Nkunda gusoma igitabo
I never said anything to anyone	Ntacyo nigeze mbwira umuntu
I didn't see it	Ntabwo nabonye
I have a job to help my family.	Mfite akazi ko gufasha umuryango wanjye.
Of course, they are just people.	Nukuri, ni abantu gusa.
You are a good person	Uri umuntu mwiza
We have a problem.	Dufite ikibazo.
You can't be everything to everyone.	Ntushobora kuba byose kuri bose.
And he was right.	Kandi yari yavuze neza.
I wanted to know.	Nashakaga kumenya.
Not much for him.	Ntabwo ari byinshi kuri we.
No, I believe there is	Ntabwo ariko, nizera ko hariho
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
I was about to leave	Nari ngiye kugenda
I just ask the question	Ndabaza gusa ikibazo
I thought you were so beautiful	Natekerezaga ko uri mwiza cyane
This went well	Ibi byagenze neza
I mean drink a lot	Ndashaka kuvuga kunywa cyane
I was scared all the time	Nagize ubwoba igihe cyose
Or maybe he didn't.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari yabikoze.
The plan was not good	Gahunda ntiyari nziza
Reason to work	Impamvu yo gukora
I think he is	Ntekereza ko ari we
Not enough to look at once.	Ntabwo bihagije kureba rimwe.
You have to do something, not a big, small thing.	Ugomba gukora ikintu, ntabwo ari ikintu kinini, gito.
Problems right now.	Kuri ubu ibibazo.
I have hair on top.	Mfite umusatsi hejuru.
Things were simple and easy for him.	Ibintu byari byoroshye kandi byoroshye kuri we.
I think, we can win together.	Ntekereza ko, dushobora gutsinda hamwe.
Study day has money.	Umunsi wo kwiga ufite amafaranga.
I saw myself working for a while	Nabonye nkora igihe gito
Whatever you have to do.	Icyo ugomba gukora cyose.
Something is not right.	Ikintu ntabwo ari cyiza.
I think you have to take it here	Ndatekereza ko ugomba gufata hano
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
What did he do.	Yakoze iki.
I am doing something good	Ndimo gukora ikintu cyiza
I have something here he said.	Mfite ikintu hano yavuze.
I like to know that there is	Nkunda kumenya ko ahari
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
At that time he would do nothing.	Icyo gihe ntacyo yari gukora.
That's what they have now.	Nibyo bafite ubu.
I'm not sure where, but here it is	Sinzi neza aho, ariko ari hano
I'm glad you did	Nishimiye ibyo ukora
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
I think he was very embarrassed	Ntekereza ko yari afite isoni cyane
Obviously not good.	Biragaragara ko atari byiza.
I did nothing	Ntacyo nigeze nkora
I also wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kandi kuvugana nawe
That's right	Nibyo rwose
That's not good enough.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
He said it was not his idea.	Yavuze ko atari igitekerezo cye.
I shouldn't have looked at my phone	Sinari nkwiye kureba terefone yanjye
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
She knew her son.	Yari azi umuhungu we.
I never saw them all	Sinigeze mbona bose
He was a bad person.	Yari umuntu mubi.
She thought the child	Yatekereje ko umwana
I should be better now.	Nkwiye kuba mwiza ubu.
It was a wonderful day.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane.
Especially the food.	Cyane cyane ibiryo.
I can't be on the phone for long	Sinshobora kuba kuri terefone igihe kirekire
I feel bad	Ndumva ari umuntu mubi
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I didn't think he needed a phone	Sinatekerezaga ko akeneye terefone
I was sure he was right	Nari nzi neza ko yari afite ukuri
I want to be early	Ndashaka kuba kare
We have.	Dufite.
I have many friends	Mfite inshuti nyinshi
He was everything.	Byose yari we.
He chose.	Yahisemo.
I really had a good time going	Nukuri nari mfite ikintu cyiza cyo kugenda
I know what you're going to do	Nzi icyo ugiye gukora
I can take the bus	Nshobora gufata bisi
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Either way, it was great.	Ibyo ari byo byose, byari byiza cyane.
You can't do this.	Ntushobora gukora ibi.
I have many friends	Mfite inshuti nyinshi
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
And it probably is.	Kandi birashoboka ko ari.
I need to think about what to do	Nkeneye gutekereza icyo gukora
I can't figure out if that's a good thing or not	Sinshobora kumenya niba aricyo kintu cyiza cyangwa atari cyo
I know he is a good person	Nzi ko ari umuntu mwiza
That was a lot for him tonight.	Ibi byari byinshi kuri we muri iri joro.
I know you have a lot of problems	Nzi ko ufite ibibazo byinshi
We have to look ahead.	Tugomba kureba imbere.
And for me it's a job.	Kandi kuri njye ni akazi.
But he is not the only one.	Ariko si umwe gusa.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
Apparently he's going where you are.	Biragaragara ko agiye aho uri.
I had no one	Nta muntu n'umwe nari mfite
There is something you need to know.	Hariho ikintu ugomba kumenya.
I had a good idea	Nagize igitekerezo cyiza
It was, like.	Byari, nka.
I think we can do that	Ntekereza ko dushobora kubikora
He has not been there since.	Kuva icyo gihe ntabwo yari ahari.
He was a thinker	Yari umuntu utekereza
What am I doing wrong? 	Niki ndimo gukora nabi?
I wanted to go home now	Nashakaga gutaha ubu
But you can talk to him.	Ariko urashobora kuvugana nawe.
I am so happy to be here	Nishimiye cyane kuguma hano
I wanted to spend more time together	Nashakaga kongera igihe hamwe
I saw what he was feeling	Nabonye ibyo yumva
Every day.	Buri munsi.
The food was simple and easy	Ibiryo byari byoroshye kandi byoroshye
I hope it is good enough for your needs.	Nizere ko ari byiza bihagije kubyo ukeneye.
I'm so glad you're here	Nishimiye cyane ko uri hano
But you have to go back to school.	Ariko ugomba gusubira ku ishuri.
At the time, I didn't think so	Icyo gihe sinigeze ntekereza
You can't see that time.	Ntushobora kubona icyo gihe.
He was just a child.	Yari umwana gusa.
We have to be here.	Tugomba kuba hano.
And he is not one of us.	Kandi ntabwo ari umwe muri twe.
He means that you have nothing wrong.	Arashaka kuvuga ko nta kibi ufite.
I can't figure out what it is	Sinshobora kumenya icyo aricyo
Money has gone up.	Amafaranga yagiye hejuru.
That's right- this is not about me.	Ibyo aribyo, ariko sibyo.
I can't beat that thing.	Ntabwo nshobora gutsinda icyo kintu.
You can try it there.	Urashobora kugerageza aho.
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.
I need to talk to you as soon as possible	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe vuba bishoboka
As his father had.	Nkuko se yari afite.
Just like to go to.	Nka Nka Kuri Kuri.
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
I don't know where he is.	Ntazi iyo ari.
I think he is right	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri
The most beautiful girl for him, he thought.	Umukobwa mwiza cyane kuri we, yatekereje.
It's your clothes.	Ni imyenda yawe.
He said badly.	Yavuze nabi.
And there is something wrong.	Kandi hariho ikintu kibi.
I just need to hear	Nkeneye kumva gusa
He was not even in the room.	Ntiyari no mu cyumba.
I needed it this morning.	Nari nkeneye iki gitondo.
He was ready to do it.	Yari yiteguye kubikora.
You are going to learn more.	Ugiye kwiga byinshi.
In all things.	Muri byose.
There is something in everyone.	Hariho ikintu muri buri wese.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
But it really is.	Ariko rwose ni.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo yari gukora.
He was my young man.	Yari umusore wanjye muto.
I want to swim every day	Ndashaka koga buri munsi
Stop eating.	Reka kurya.
I also saw the same thing you saw today	Nanjye nabonye ikintu kimwe wabonye uyumunsi
I was here in my house.	Nari hano mu nzu yanjye.
I'm just scared	Mfite ubwoba gusa
I didn't want to hear what he was saying	Sinifuzaga kumva ibyo yumva
However, this is not true.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
It was good to feel good.	Byari byiza kumva neza.
I had enough problems today	Nari mfite ibibazo bihagije kuri uyumunsi
I should not have been afraid	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugira ubwoba
I have never seen children.	Sinigeze mbona abana.
I think that's enough for today	Ntekereza ko ibyo bihagije kuri uyu munsi
It is not very high.	Ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
I didn't hear or hear anything	Ntacyo numvise cyangwa numva
And maybe that would be nice.	Kandi birashoboka ko byaba byiza.
I have a plan and I am doing it.	Mfite gahunda kandi ndimo kubikora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
So far, nothing good.	Kugeza ubu, nta kintu cyiza cyane.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
Reason for being present	Impamvu yo kuba ahari
That's right.	Ko aribyo.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Probably not today.	Birashoboka ko atari uyu munsi.
Just living together.	Gusa kubana.
But this one would be great, he said.	Yavuze ko ariko iyi yaba nziza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You don't look good.	Ntabwo usa neza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo aribyo.
But it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
I don't like simple things.	Ntabwo nkunda ibintu byoroshye.
I just have things to do	Mfite ibintu byo gukora gusa
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
I am a bad person.	Ndi umuntu mubi.
It wasn’t just clothes.	Ntabwo yari imyenda gusa.
I have children.	Mfite abana.
I think he wants to know all this	Ndatekereza ko ashaka kumenya ibi byose
I love this room	Nkunda iki cyumba
Eventually he found a place to live.	Amaherezo yaje kubona aho aba.
I needed a job.	Nari nkeneye akazi.

You really are.	Uri rwose.
Not your best day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi wawe mwiza.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ari ukuri.
You have the first place in everything.	Ufite umwanya wa mbere muri byose.
And she probably wanted a baby.	Kandi birashoboka ko yashakaga umwana.
We have to come again.	Tugomba kongera kuza.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
You know what he means.	Uzi icyo ashaka kuvuga.
I'm really scared.	Mfite ubwoba rwose.
I understand how he thinks about this	Ndumva uburyo atekereza kuri ibi

Maybe he said something or something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo yavuze cyangwa ikindi.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.

He hadn't seen it.	Ntiyari yabonye.
With	Hamwe na.
And to eat.	No kurya.
Especially for me.	Cyane cyane kuri njye.
Me, good friend.	Njye, inshuti nziza.
I am very happy to buy	Nishimiye cyane kugura
I was thinking a lot	Nari natekereje cyane
I know who you think looks good	Nzi uwo utekereza ko asa neza
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
There are many good reasons.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi nziza.
I feel like you want to talk to me	Ndumva ushaka kuvugana nanjye
I guess it's my fault	Ndakeka ko ari amakosa yanjye
I want to do things right	Ndashaka gukora ibintu neza
Now they have.	Ubu bafite.
I didn't want to read	Sinifuzaga gusoma
I can see nothing	Ntacyo nshobora kubona
I'm not sure when	Sinzi neza igihe
I love my wife.	Nkunda umugore wanjye.
But one has more.	Ariko umuntu afite byinshi.
He knows everything.	Ibyo azi byose.
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
No one has ever heard of it.	Nta muntu numwe wigeze yumva.
I can do something good.	Nshobora gukora ikintu cyiza.
Above me.	Hejuru yanjye.
I didn't know for years.	Sinari nzi imyaka.
I didn’t think he had a family	Sinatekerezaga ko afite umuryango
I really needed it	Nari nkeneye cyane
This is it.	Ubu ni bwo.
It was easy to see outside.	Byari byoroshye kubona hanze.
I know what you are	Nzi icyo uri cyo
We have to do the work.	Tugomba gukora akazi.
But he is not right.	Ariko ntabwo afite ukuri.
It seems.	Birasa.
I just want my money	Ndashaka amafaranga yanjye gusa
He just told me what he wanted me to do.	Yambwiye gusa icyo yashakaga ko nkora.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He is not one of us.	Ntabwo ari umwe muri twe.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza
She looks good.	Asa nkaho ari mwiza.
I thought for a moment.	Natekereje gato.
Here are some common ones.	Hano hari ibintu bisanzwe.
You can do it here, now.	Urashobora kubikora hano, ubu.
Waiting for someone to hear.	Gutegereza ko umuntu yumva.
She is younger than me.	Ari muto kundusha.
I was one of the latter	Nari umwe muri aba nyuma
I think he is trying	Ndatekereza ko arimo kugerageza
I want to hear what he has to say.	Ndashaka kumva icyo avuga.
I knew them all well	Nari nzi neza bose
He is a gifted young man.	Ni umusore ufite impano.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
They all had a normal feel.	Bose bari bafite kumva bisanzwe.
You can say whatever you want.	Urashobora kuvuga icyo ushaka cyose.

But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
This one could be me.	Uyu ashobora kuba njye.
He asked why.	Yabajije impamvu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I wasn't sure if it was true	Sinari nzi neza ko ari ukuri
Nothing could have worked better.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora neza.
Really anything on this planet.	Nukuri ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose kuri iyi si.
And that’s probably the good thing.	Kandi birashoboka ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
My advice is one	Nama ndi umwe
I want to go now.	Ndashaka kugenda ubu.
Stop giving up.	Reka kureka.
That is the same thing.	Icyo ni ikintu kimwe.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
But you have to do it.	Ariko ugomba kubikora.
Whatever you want.	Ibyo ushaka byose.
But he is human.	Ariko ni umuntu.
Everything.	Byose.

I feel very lucky.	Ndumva mfite amahirwe menshi.
I can't do anything good	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ikintu cyiza
Almost absolutely.	Hafi ya rwose.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
You can get a lot of money upstairs.	Urashobora kubona amafaranga menshi hejuru.
He is one former player.	Ni umukinnyi umwe yahoze.

He chose this.	Yahisemo ibi.

And she was a beautiful woman.	Kandi yari umugore mwiza.
I've never liked that before.	Sinigeze nkunda gutya mbere.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.

But he was here.	Ariko yari hano.
Or he and I.	Cyangwa we na njye.
He should not have come here.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kuza hano.
It would be so easy.	Byaba byoroshye cyane.
To say that we can do better.	Kuvuga ko dushobora gukora neza.
I wanted to be his friend again	Nashakaga kongera kuba inshuti ye
Or there is.	Cyangwa hari.
I never thought of anything else	Sinigeze ntekereza ikindi kintu
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.

This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona

I didn’t think it would go away.	Sinatekerezaga ko byari kugenda.

He looked away quickly.	Yarebye kure vuba.

I had everything for me	Nari mfite ibintu byose kuri njye
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.

His father was not very home.	Se ntiyari murugo cyane.

And that was exactly what happened.	Kandi ibyo rwose byari ibintu.
I need to hear something	Nkeneye kumva ikintu
I just didn't know what it was	Gusa sinari nzi icyo aricyo
Never, ever.	Nta na rimwe, na rimwe.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ibyo ntabwo aribyo bigoye cyane.

It was good for me	Kuri njye byari byiza
I should have heard something	Nari nkwiye kumva ikintu
I think you have.	Ndatekereza ko ufite.
But we are nothing.	Ariko ntacyo turi cyo.
I didn't think they would do this.	Sinatekerezaga ko bari gukora ibi.
This was the plan.	Iyi yari gahunda.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
Maybe if we.	Ahari niba twe.
I hope you do well	Nizere ko ukora neza
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.

He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
Here, he had everything he wanted.	Hano, yari afite ibyo yashakaga byose.

Inside.	Imbere.
There would be many reasons.	Byaba impamvu nyinshi.

He never heard of a dog.	Ntiyigeze yumva imbwa.

There are problems.	Hariho ibibazo.

It doesn't look like it.	Ntabwo asa.
She is well dressed, and.	Yambaye neza, kandi.
This is very similar.	Ibi birasa cyane.
I didn't see any of it	Nta na kimwe muri byo nabonye
Sitting in front sitting.	Yicaye imbere yicaye.

One day, he is here.	Umunsi umwe, ari hano.

There were things that were normal.	Hariho ibintu bisanzwe byari bisanzwe.

I needed to be close to you	Nari nkeneye kuba hafi yawe
I don't know the problem.	Sinzi ikibazo.
I knew it was time to dump her and move on	Nari nzi ko bishoboka icyo gihe
Everything is fine so far.	Ibintu byose ni byiza kugeza hano.

He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
I hope you love your new home	Nizere ko ukunda inzu yawe nshya
I hope that's what you said	Ndizera ko aribyo wavuze
They were not.	Ntabwo bari.
Going that way.	Kugenda gutya.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
The question now is, will he do it ?.	Ikibazo ubu, azabikora?.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ibintu gusa.
But he never did anything.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yigeze akora.
He has, he really has.	Afite, afite rwose.
I think about quitting	Ndatekereza kureka
And, in time.	Kandi, mugihe.

But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
I think there is a lot.	Ntekereza ko hari byinshi.

He needed time alone.	Yari akeneye igihe wenyine.
He has no.	Ntabwo afite.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I saw it now.	Nabonye ubu.
I was going to talk about being friends with us, too	Nari ngiye kuvuga kuri twe kuba inshuti, natwe
I don't see any problem	Ntabwo mbona ikibazo na kimwe
He has to be scared.	Agomba kugira ubwoba.
A beautiful woman like him	Umugore mwiza nka we
Or it was.	Cyangwa byari.
He said one thing he could think of.	Yavuze ikintu kimwe yashoboraga gutekereza kuvuga.
He was not sure of anything.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ikintu na kimwe.

Very good advice	Inama nziza cyane

Or you may not have.	Cyangwa ntushobora kugira.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
And he could see why.	Kandi yashoboraga kubona impamvu.
He was going to do it.	Yari agiye kubikora.
We are friends now.	Turi inshuti ubu.
I don't know how he did it	Ntabwo nzi uko yabikoze
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.

Being a teacher.	Kuba umwarimu.

That's good.	Nibyiza.
You don't have to do that.	Ntugomba kubikora.

You know exactly what he did.	Uzi neza ibyo yakoze.
There are many here.	Hano hari benshi.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba hano.

If you have to.	Niba ugomba.
I mean his clothes	Ndashaka kuvuga imyenda ye
It's not just a day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi gusa.
It was early in the morning.	Byari kare mu gitondo.
Absolutely not good.	Rwose ntabwo ari mwiza.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
The child was scared.	Umwana yari ubwoba.
I never saw my family	Sinigeze mbona umuryango wanjye
It's the same.	Ni kimwe.
You were a child too.	Nawe wari umwana.

He told me when he was in me.	Yambwiye igihe yari muri njye.
I have to do the same	Nanjye ngomba kubikora
In fact, they were.	Mubyukuri, bari.
People are scared, that's just the truth.	Abantu bafite ubwoba, ibyo ni ukuri gusa.
Well not every day.	Nibyiza ntabwo buri munsi.
You need to live	Ukeneye kubaho
I wanted to hear something	Nashakaga kumva ikintu

He does not want to be involved in this matter.	Ntabwo yifuza kugira icyo akora muri iki kibazo.
I was in him, we were one	Nari muri we, twari umwe
Tell me that.	Mbwira ibyo.

He is not looking for anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe arimo gushaka.
I think this.	Ntekereza ko ibi.
I don't know how to do it	Ntabwo nzi uburyo bwo kubikora
You can have what you need.	Urashobora kugira ibyo ukeneye.
But he did not need to see.	Ariko ntiyari akeneye kubona.

I know what he wants to do	Nzi icyo ashaka gukora
I didn't see anyone	Ntabwo nabonye umuntu
He may be better to me than I am.	Ashobora kuba mwiza kuri njye kuruta njye.
Dogs are good for that.	Imbwa nibyiza kubyo.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi cyane byo gufata.
And it is possible that this was true.	Kandi birashoboka ko ibyo byari ukuri.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
We have something for everyone.	Dufite ikintu kuri buri wese.
Eating together is good.	Kurya hamwe hamwe nibyiza.
He had things to do.	Yari afite ibintu byo gukora.
In all things.	Muri byose.
He was an expert in making money fast.	Yari umuhanga mu gushaka amafaranga vuba.
I knew what he meant	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
He will be gone.	Azaba yagiye.
We have to go back to work.	Tugomba gusubira ku kazi.
It would be close.	Yaba hafi.
He didn't really think about it today.	Ntabwo rwose yatekerezaga neza muri iki gihe.
This is not a movie.	Iyi ntabwo ari firime.
No plans.	Nta gahunda.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Ibyo birashoboka kubikora.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Probably a long time ago.	Birashoboka igihe kirekire.
But now you are something else.	Ariko ubu uri ikindi kintu.
He went one day early.	Yagiye umunsi umwe kare.
I have to think about more.	Ngomba gutekereza kuri byinshi.
You have to be very small.	Ugomba kuba ikintu gito cyane.
I can't carry things	Sinshobora gutwara ibintu
I can't see.	Ntashobora kubona.
I really wanted to go.	Nashakaga rwose kugenda.
I needed a little time	Nari nkeneye umwanya muto
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
I never wanted to do that	Sinigeze nshaka kubikora
I need to go to a meeting now	Nkeneye kujya mu nama ubu

He thought.	Yatekereje.
We are all here.	Twese turi hano.

And you need a better plan.	Kandi ukeneye gahunda nziza.
I did a lot of bad things.	Nakoze ibintu byinshi nabi.
They are in me.	Bari muri njye.
You want to win.	Ushaka gutsinda.
I thought there was something good going on here	Natekerezaga ko hano hari ikintu cyiza hano
He must have gone.	Agomba kuba yagiye.
He is right about that.	Afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
I said nothing	Ntacyo nabwiye
I had no reason.	Nta mpamvu nari mfite.
All this time.	Iki gihe cyose.
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.
Why? 	Kuki?
I don’t do much here.	Ntabwo nkora byinshi hano.
He was not alone in that.	Muri ibyo ntabwo yari wenyine.
It was great	Byari byiza cyane
I never saw the things he did	Sinigeze mbona ibintu yakoze
I don't know who he is	Sinzi uwo ari we
It won't be good out here.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza hano hanze.
He can do whatever he wants.	Arashobora gukora icyo ashaka.
I have a lot of mistakes	Mfite amakosa menshi
I'm worried.	Mfite impungenge.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
It's just beautiful.	Ni mwiza gusa.
They know how to make money.	Bazi gushaka amafaranga.
Today is a gift.	Uyu munsi ni impano.
He thought he had chosen something else.	Yatekereje ko yahisemo ikindi kintu.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
I heard someone talking.	Numvise umuntu avuga.
I was about to come	Nari ngiye kuza
Nothing for me.	Ntacyo kuri njye.
I was very lucky	Nagize amahirwe cyane
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
This is a bad thing.	Iki kintu kibi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo byari ukuri.
Nka Nka Nka.	Nka Nka Nka.
That was it.	Ko byari.
I guess he feels like an outsider	Ndakeka ko yumva ari umuntu wo hanze
He was not smart.	Ntiyari afite ubwenge.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.

As far as I know, he would not have done this	Nari nzi, ntabwo yari gukora ibi

That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I enjoyed the good book	Nishimiye igitabo cyiza
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, agomba kubona amafaranga.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kuba ukeneye amafaranga neza.
One has to live.	Umuntu agomba kubaho.
And he must have.	Kandi agomba kugira.
I mean you look good on me	Ndashaka kuvuga ko usa neza kuri njye
I know he wants to play	Nzi ko ashaka gukina

In the end.	Amaherezo.
And he is human.	Kandi ni umuntu.

I don't understand that.	Ntabwo numva ibyo.
I knew he was going well	Nari nzi ko agenda neza
He needed help.	Yari akeneye ubufasha.
I need to stop thinking like that	Nkeneye guhagarika gutekereza gutya
I just thought you should know, that's all	Gusa natekereje ko ugomba kumenya, nibyo byose
It's just a phone call.	Ni terefone gusa.
The problem is people.	Ikibazo ni abantu.
I think it would be nice	Ndatekereza ko yaba mwiza
But he is not alone.	Ariko si we wenyine.
You have to be that way	Ugomba kuba uko
He didn't seem to know what to say.	Ntabwo yasaga nkaho azi icyo avuga.
I can't have this in my house	Sinshobora kugira ibi mu nzu yanjye
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
What he did ask was that he could stay for a while.	Icyo yabajije nuko yashoboraga kuguma igihe gito.
I should have come sooner	Nari nkwiye kuza vuba
I never wanted to do that.	Sinigeze nshaka kubikora.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
And, it was.	Kandi, byari.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
If not, there are things you can do there.	Niba atari byo, hari ibintu ushobora gukora aho.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I am very happy to buy	Nishimiye cyane kugura
You don't have to try.	Ntugomba kugerageza.
I needed to talk to him	Nari nkeneye kuvugana na we
He is on top.	Ari hejuru.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
We have to give advice.	Tugomba kugira inama.
I think he was right	Ntekereza ko yari afite ukuri
You have to look ahead.	Ugomba kureba imbere.
I thought I was beautiful	Natekereje ko ndi mwiza
Either that or I can't understand.	Yaba ibyo cyangwa ntashobora kumva.
I want to be with you	Ndashaka kubana nawe
I didn't hear anything	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
It had to be.	Yagombaga kuba.
I like to tell people that	Nkunda kubwira abantu ibyo
We have to see one of those	Tugomba kubona kimwe muri ibyo
I thought all that was ahead.	Natekereje ko ibyo byose byari imbere.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I want to be with you for a long time	Ndashaka kubana nawe igihe kirekire
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
But it’s really scary.	Ariko rwose ni ubwoba.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
I really believe this is true.	Ndizera rwose ko ibi ari ukuri.
But you can drink a lot.	Ariko urashobora kunywa cyane.
I have never heard of this good in a very long time	Sinigeze numva ibi byiza mugihe kinini cyane
I thought about it a lot	Natekereje kuri byinshi
One first.	Umwe mbere.
Almost all day.	Hafi umunsi wose.
You can't be that difficult.	Ntushobora kuba ibyo bigoye.
They were not here.	Ntabwo bari hano.
But now we need to go far.	Ariko ubu dukeneye kujya kure.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
Not just one day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi umwe gusa.
He also agreed to do so.	Yemeye kandi kubikora.
Seeing and hearing.	Kureba no kumva.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza cyane.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
After him.	Nyuma ye.
I have no plans, and I feel good	Nta gahunda mfite, kandi numva ari byiza
He was probably gone.	Birashoboka ko yari yagiye.
He was a young child.	Yari umwana muto.
I'm not sure what that is	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo aricyo
I really needed to think	Nari nkeneye gutekereza cyane
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
He may or may not do it	Ashobora cyangwa ntashobora kubikora
But that is not what I see.	Ariko ibyo sibyo mbona.
I thought of coming after you	Natekereje kuza nyuma yawe
I really enjoyed the book	Nishimiye igitabo cyane
I am doing a lot in each one	Ndimo gukora byinshi muri buri kimwe
He was still your child.	Yari akiri umwana wawe.
I never believed he was going	Sinigeze nizera ko agenda
You don't have to do that.	Ntagomba kubikora.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
However, there is no reason to go here.	Ariko, nta mpamvu yo kujya muri ibi hano.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
And who we are.	Ninde kandi icyo turi cyo.
It really looks good.	Rwose birasa neza.
If only it were easier.	Niba byari byoroshye gusa.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
I am very worried about this	Mfite impungenge cyane kuri ibi
I didn't mean to say	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
I was not scared at all	Ntabwo nagize ubwoba na gato
That's not where we are.	Ntabwo ari aho turi.
I like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo.
I didn't know what to do or say	Sinari nzi icyo gukora cyangwa kuvuga
Obviously not a good thing.	Biragaragara ko atari ibintu byiza.
I saw it in front of me	Nabonye imbere yanjye
I have to get along well with you	Ngomba kubana neza nawe
Only then I was not good at it.	Gusa icyo gihe ntabwo nari mwiza muri byo.
I have a money problem.	Mfite ikibazo cyo kubona amafaranga.
I am also happy to do so	Nishimiye kandi kubikora
I know he feels the same way	Nzi ko yumva ibintu kimwe
I can win anything	Nshobora gutsinda ikintu cyose
I never wanted one of those	Sinigeze nshaka kimwe muri ibyo
I don't mean to say	Sinshaka kuvuga
I was out for a while	Nari hanze igihe gito
But I can't do that.	Ariko sinshobora kubikora.
I have a job to help my family.	Mfite akazi ko gufasha umuryango wanjye.
She is my child.	Ni umwana wanjye.
He thought.	Yatekerezaga.
I like things.	Nkunda ibintu.
That would be it.	Ibyo byari kuba.
I'm so sorry to hear that	Mbabajwe cyane no kuvuga
I was so bad at school	Nari mubi cyane mu ishuri
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
I wanted to stay there.	Nashakaga kuguma aho.
'Time.	'Umwanya.
First time for everything	Igihe cya mbere kuri byose
Her clothes are beautiful.	Imyenda ye ni nziza.
He asked for a lot, not a lot of money.	Yasabye byinshi cyane, ntabwo ari amafaranga menshi.
I'm not sure, really	Ntabwo nzi neza, mubyukuri
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
I think that would be nice.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza.
This looks like we're at home.	Ibi birasa nkaho turi murugo.
He is a very good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza rwose.
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose neza.
I know you want them all	Nzi ko ushaka bose
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Probably not something everyone has.	Birashoboka ko atari ikintu buri wese afite.
I have a small problem	Mfite ikibazo gito
I know you were just a good friend	Nzi ko wari inshuti nziza gusa
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
The fact that you have to understand.	Kuba ugomba kumva.
I don't want to.	Ntashaka.
And it's up to me.	Kandi ni wowe kuri njye.
I love my family.	Nkunda umuryango wanjye.
I'm not sorry about that.	Ntabwo mbabajwe nibyo.
But this evil is worse than ever.	Ariko uyu mubi mubi kuruta uko byari bisanzwe.
You can't see in it.	Ntushobora kubona muri byo.
I am very happy to do so	Nishimiye cyane kubikora
Especially in front of him.	Cyane cyane imbere ye.
I thought he was doing very well	Natekereje ko akora neza cyane
I think it’s a good thing to do	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza cyo gukora
Being close.	Kuba hafi.
Anything over time.	Ikintu cyose cyo kurenza igihe.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
We have a problem here	Dufite ikibazo hano
I never saw much	Sinigeze mbona cyane
If this were the case, I would not say.	Niba ibi byari ikibazo, ntashobora kuvuga.
I was not doing well	Ntabwo nari nkora neza
Today that man is me.	Uyu munsi ko umuntu ari njye.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
I have it all	Mfite byose
I want to have a girl	Ndashaka kugira umukobwa
Glad to have you here	Nishimiye kuba ufite hano
You can.	Urashobora.
You have to be good to go.	Ugomba kuba mwiza kugenda.
Just like you	Nkuko nawe.
I know nothing	Nta na kimwe nzi
I can't hang up the phone	Sinshobora guhagarika terefone
Can't find what you're looking for?	Ntushobora kubona icyo urimo gushaka?.
He did not do well.	Ntabwo yakoze neza.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
That's what people know.	Nibyo abantu bazi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I was very tall	Nari hejuru cyane
I can't be that person	Sinshobora kuba uwo muntu
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I had no way of communicating with anyone	Ntabwo nari mfite uburyo bwo kuvugana numuntu
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
I'm close to you now.	Ubu ndi hafi yanjye.
All together	Bose hamwe.
I understand what he would do	Ndumva icyo yari gukora
I never thought it was under me	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ari munsi yanjye
Everything is simple and good.	Byose byoroshye kandi byiza.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
You saw that.	Wabonye ibyo.
I hope a lot of people have all this	Nizera ko abantu benshi bafite ibi byose
I want to know who he is	Ndashaka kumenya uwo ari we
And that sounds like it.	Kandi ibyo birasa.
I never saw him do that.	Sinigeze mbona abikora.
You are working.	Urimo gukora.
I wonder if this is a concern	Ndabaza niba ibi ari impungenge
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
And you're going to see a lot of us.	Kandi ugiye kubona byinshi kuri twe.
I know what a house is	Nzi inzu icyo ari cyo
I want to see him work again.	Ndashaka kongera kubona akora.
I could never buy it	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kugura
The problems are many.	Ibibazo ni byinshi.
I saw him do it.	Nabonye abikora.
But he was not sure if that was the case.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza niba ibyo aribyo.
We had a job.	Twari dufite akazi.
I never felt the need to do that.	Sinigeze mbona ko nkeneye kubikora.
He had not said much.	Ntabwo yari yavuze byinshi.
Probably, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka.
He loved to stay where he was.	Yakundaga cyane kuguma aho yari ari.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I can do it for a long time	Nshobora kubikora igihe kinini
I wanted him to do things right	Nashakaga ko akora ibintu neza
One day, no problem	Umunsi, nta kibazo
I just feel so bad	Gusa ndumva mubi rwose
I think he is a good person	Ntekereza ko ari umuntu mwiza
It was not easy for me.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye kuri njye.
I can't talk to you right now	Sinshobora kuvugana nawe nonaha
Everything was good and normal.	Byose byari byiza kandi bisanzwe.
He will be home tomorrow.	Ejo azaba murugo.
I like to be friends	Nkunda kuba inshuti
But he knows nothing.	Ariko ntacyo azi.
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
I can do a lot of good things	Nshobora gukora byinshi byiza
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
There is so much to do here.	Hano hari byinshi byo gukora hano.
There is no going back, now.	Nta gusubira inyuma, ubu.
I have nothing	Ntacyo mfite
I have a lot to say	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga
I know that is a good thing for me	Nzi ko aricyo kintu cyiza kuri njye
I hope you have something to do with that.	Nizere ko hari icyo ushobora gukora hamwe nibyo.
I think it's a good and bad thing.	Ndakeka ko ari ikintu cyiza kandi kibi.
I knew what he meant	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It is not always easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But I can't have my own house.	Ariko ntashobora kugira inzu yanjye.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
Let's go upstairs.	Ni hejuru.
I have never seen him like this before	Sinigeze mbona nka we mbere
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
Good people.	Abantu neza.
I wanted it badly	Nashakaga nabi
I'm so sorry.	Mbabajwe cyane nibyo.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko.
I needed to talk to you alone	Nari nkeneye kuvugana nawe wenyine
They didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo bari bazi icyo.
It is not a house in the back	Ntabwo ari inzu iri inyuma
Maybe for a long time.	Ahari kugeza igihe kirekire.
He feels far away from everything.	Yumva ari kure ya buri kintu cyose.
I didn't want to.	Ntabwo nashakaga.
You really have to play this movie.	Ugomba rwose gukina iyi firime.
But one has.	Ariko umwe afite.
Whatever I like to go for	Ibyo ari byo byose nkunda kugenda
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
I think he is the same as me.	Ntekereza ko ari kimwe nanjye na we.
He was at work.	Yari ku kazi.
He knows he has to go.	Azi ko agomba kugenda.
I have to look at this	Ngomba kureba muri ibi
He thought for sure.	Yatekereje ko rwose.
He was really young.	Yari umusore rwose.
And no.	Kandi ntabwo.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
You don't know how beautiful you are.	Ntabwo uzi uko uri mwiza.
I needed money	Nari nkeneye amafaranga
I guess that was a mistake.	Ndakeka ko ibyo byari amakosa.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I can't say what it is.	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo aricyo.
I have a lot of things	Mfite ibintu byinshi
But today he had.	Ariko uyu munsi yari afite.
I really wanted him to do something good	Nashakaga rwose ko agira ikintu cyiza
I can't do this.	Ntashobora gukora ibi.
Really, really, space.	Nukuri, mubyukuri, umwanya.
I think he’s just scared	Ntekereza ko afite ubwoba gusa
He did not know what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
You need to hear it again.	Ukeneye kongera kumva.
I didn't want to play again.	Sinifuzaga kongera gukina.
I doubt anyone does.	Ndashidikanya ko umuntu wese abikora.
I want something else	Ndashaka ikindi kintu
And there is truth in truth.	Kandi hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
I can't think of anything to do.	Sinshobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe cyo gukora.
He makes cars to do what he likes.	Akora imodoka gukora ibyo akunda.
I was sure of one thing	Nari nzi neza ikintu kimwe
He did not know what to say or do.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga cyangwa gukora.
This one was.	Uyu yari.
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
I mean, we can say it all	Ndashaka kuvuga, dushobora kuvuga byose
That would be great.	Ibyo byari kuba byiza cyane.
Or for most of us.	Cyangwa kuri benshi muri twe.
I'm glad he's here	Nishimiye ko ari hano
I had no problem	Nta kibazo nagize
But he knew enough.	Ariko yari azi bihagije.
It is very unlikely that someone will do it.	Ntabwo bishoboka cyane ko umuntu azabikora.
I thought in all of this	Natekereje ko muri ibi byose
They had no problems.	Ntabwo bari bafite ibibazo.
I had nothing to leave	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo kuva aho
He doesn't look like her.	Ntabwo asa na we.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
There is.	Hariho.
I wanted to talk to you	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe
I know how to live	Nzi kubaho
In one week.	Mu cyumweru kimwe.
I can't.	Sinshobora.
I should have done that	Nari nkwiye kubikora
But that’s like.	Ariko ibyo ni nka.
I just want to be close to him	Ndashaka gusa kuba hafi ye
Everything is possible !.	Byose birashoboka!.
We had a job.	Twari dufite akazi.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
Most of the time, it's good enough.	Igihe kinini, nibyiza bihagije.
I'm happy to be here with you	Nishimiye hano hamwe nawe
It was very difficult to believe everything he said.	Byari bigoye cyane kwizera ikintu cyose yavuze.
I guess he chose to leave early that day	Ndakeka ko yahisemo kugenda kare uwo munsi
I am in front of him	Ndi imbere ye
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
I had a great day	Nagize umunsi mwiza
I had a gift for him	Nari mfite impano kuri we
He was in school alone.	Yari mu ishuri wenyine.
He said you were the gift he needed.	Yavuze ko uri impano yari akeneye.
I didn't know what it was	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo
I'm like him.	Ndi nka we.
Who knows why.	Ninde uzi impamvu.
He could do anything.	Yashoboraga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
Great idea	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane
I believe what he says	Nizera ibyo avuga
I know what you're doing	Nzi ibyo ukora
When you are ahead, you are going to win.	Iyo uri imbere, ugiye gutsinda.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I can have an idea	Nshobora kugira igitekerezo
I am currently looking for a job.	Ubu ndashaka akazi.
I never heard of it	Sinigeze numva
That question, however, is one of reality.	Icyo kibazo ariko, ni kimwe mubyukuri.
Well, obviously.	Nibyiza, biragaragara.
We need a plan.	Dukeneye gahunda.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
All the best food, possible.	Ibiryo byiza byose, birashoboka.
i.	i.
And for me, it was.	Kandi kuri njye, byari byo.
I know there is.	Nzi ko ahari.
I just wanted to be close to him	Nashakaga gusa kuba hafi ye
And they are both me.	Kandi bombi ni njye.
However, this was a family.	Ariko kandi, uyu wari umuryango.
Apparently he was right.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ukuri.
I think that was absolutely true	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari ukuri rwose
I didn't do anything wrong	Ntabwo nakoze ikintu kibi
The girl, my age, was in front of me	Umukobwa, imyaka yanjye, yari imbere yanjye
They were many.	Bari benshi.
He has to go, he has to go, he said.	Agomba kugenda, agomba kugenda, yavuze.
I know what he meant	Nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
You don’t know exactly when.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo gihe.
I think he's scared	Ntekereza ko afite ubwoba
He is not a good person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mwiza.
There is a lot of concern here.	Hano hari impungenge nyinshi.
They were so many.	Bari benshi cyane.
One day, he left.	Umunsi umwe, yagiye.
He had already said the same thing he should not have.	Yari amaze kuvuga ikintu kimwe atagomba kugira.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
You need your car.	Ukeneye imodoka yawe.
I was a child.	Nigeze kuba umwana.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I think that would be a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba ari amakosa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I was young and intelligent	Nari muto kandi uzi ubwenge
I needed to be in that world	Nari nkeneye kuba muri iyo si
Only.	Gusa.
There is not much I can do about it.	Nta kintu kinini nshobora gukora kuri ibyo.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
It was a lot.	Byari byinshi.
Reka.	Reka.
You don't have to come here.	Ntugomba kuza hano.
That day.	Uwo munsi.
I wanted to know why	Nashakaga kumenya impamvu
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
It’s not hard to see why.	Ntabwo bigoye kubona impamvu.
There are good things.	Hariho ibintu byiza.
I don't want to live.	Sinshaka kubaho.
I don't know what else you can ask for.	Sinzi ikindi ushobora gusaba.
I didn't really believe it at the time	Ntabwo nigeze nizera mubyukuri icyo gihe
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
I don't want to see anything.	Sinshaka kubona ikintu na kimwe.
I think the problem.	Ntekereza ko ikibazo.
No one has anything for me here.	Nta muntu ufite ikintu kuri njye hano.
But without saying a word.	Ariko nta kuvuga.
He had everything he needed	Yari afite ibyo yari akeneye byose
There is a time for everything.	Hariho umwanya wa buri kintu.
He had a very nice car.	Yari afite imodoka nziza cyane.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
I can't go home now	Sinshobora gutaha ubu
'	'
I really like to know where he is	Nkunda cyane kumenya aho ari
We have to talk about what we have to do.	Tugomba kuvuga kubyo tugomba gukora.
And you can’t just take things for granted.	Kandi ntushobora gufata ibintu gusa.
And we are in time.	Kandi turi mugihe.
I'm not someone you want to know.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu ushaka kumenya.
All day long	Umunsi wose.
You are very high.	Uri hejuru cyane.
There are problems, though.	Hariho ibibazo, naho.
I really need one of those	Nkeneye cyane kimwe muri ibyo
But we have to act fast.	Ariko tugomba gukora vuba.
No one is in the room.	Nta muntu uri mu cyumba.
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
He knew where to look.	Yari azi aho agomba kureba.
I can make mistakes	Nshobora gukora amakosa
I didn't know what he was talking about	Sinari nzi ibyo avuga
He thought aloud.	Yatekereje hejuru.
But tonight.	Ariko kuri iri joro.
It was always true.	Buri gihe byari ukuri.
I know what he is saying	Nzi ibyo avuga
We are all human beings here.	Twese turi abantu hano.
I was young, but I was not young	Nari muto, ariko ntabwo nari muto
Like.	Nkuko.
He said he was a good friend.	Yavuze ko yari inshuti nziza.
I needed to stop thinking like that	Nari nkeneye guhagarika gutekereza gutya
He was never afraid.	Nta gihe na kimwe yigeze agira ubwoba.
I knew the truth though	Nari nzi ukuri ariko
And what he had done.	Kandi ibyo yari yakoze.
And I am the only one.	Kandi uwo ni njye wenyine.
It is not for him.	Ntabwo ari kuri we.
I think he wanted to tell me something	Ntekereza ko yashakaga kumbwira ikintu
It's another bad thing.	Ni ikindi kintu kibi.
I knew nothing.	Ntacyo nari nzi.
I didn't want to look at my phone again	Sinifuzaga kongera kureba kuri terefone yanjye
I have to talk to someone	Ngomba kuvugana n'umuntu
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekerezaga.
And he is right.	Kandi afite ukuri.
We have to wait another time.	Tugomba gutegereza ikindi gihe.
He knew things.	Yari azi ibintu.
I hope they are far away	Ndizera ko bari kure
He needed a reason to be there.	Yari akeneye impamvu yo kuba ahari.
I am very far from him	Ndi kure cyane ye
They have a reason.	Bafite impamvu.
I have a small problem.	Mfite ikibazo gito.
I guess you were right	Ndakeka ko wari ufite ukuri
However, this is not the case here.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Yes, there are many.	Nibyo, hari byinshi.
I was very skilled	Nari umuhanga cyane
From here it seems.	Kuva hano birasa.
It was a great party.	Byari ibirori byiza.
I have nothing.	Nta na kimwe mfite.
Especially if there is money involved.	Cyane cyane niba hari amafaranga arimo.
I didn't want to live	Sinifuzaga kubaho
In us.	Muri twe.
Good luck to him.	Amahirwe kuri we.
But here, too, one makes mistakes.	Ariko hano nawe umuntu akora amakosa.
He started walking every night.	Yatangiye kugenda buri joro.
But he would not come.	Ariko ntiyari kuza.
I can't stay here	Sinshobora kuguma hano
I really need to do something about that.	Nkwiye rwose kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo.
I should have eaten	Nari nkwiye kurya
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
I didn’t think well enough	Sinari natekereje neza bihagije
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
Good things, it is.	Ibintu byiza, ni.
It was not a mistake.	Ntabwo byari amakosa.
They were not behind me.	Ntabwo bari inyuma yanjye.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I wanted this behind me	Nashakaga ibi inyuma yanjye
I have never seen a better person in this world	Sinigeze mbona umuntu mwiza kuri iyi si
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I'm not sure if there is anything to see.	Ntabwo nzi neza niba hari icyo kubona.
I can't do it now	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ubu
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
I thought to myself that this would be easy, easy.	Natekereje muri njye ko ibi bizaba byoroshye, byoroshye.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
I know how he can get it	Nzi uburyo ashobora kubona
It’s not just something	Ntabwo ari ikintu gusa
He did not comment on the issue.	Ntacyo yavuze ku kibazo cye.
I shouldn’t have done that.	Sinari nkwiye kubikora.
You can't do it alone.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Large and small.	Kinini na gito.
But you have to listen.	Ariko ugomba no kumva.
I want to know why	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu
But one cannot know for sure.	Ariko umuntu ntashobora kumenya neza.
I was really close	Nari hafi yanjye rwose
Probably not what he wanted.	Birashoboka ko atari muri we icyo yashakaga.
He has to act quickly.	Agomba kugira icyo akora vuba.
I don't think that's possible	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka
We need to get more.	Tugomba kubona byinshi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo tugomba gukora ubu.
I was about to quit.	Nari ngiye kureka.
I think we should all do that	Ntekereza ko twese tugomba kubikora
I know what you want	Nzi icyo aricyo ushaka
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I don't know about that	Ntacyo nzi kuri ibyo
I mean, he does it all the time.	Ndashaka kuvuga, abikora buri gihe.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
I think that's why he came here	Ntekereza ko ari yo mpamvu yaje hano
I can't help it.	Sinshobora gufasha.
I didn't do much.	Ntabwo nakoze byinshi.
Question.	Ikibazo.
And in, and in.	Kandi muri, no muri.
That's great.	Ni byiza cyane.
I need to think about everything he said	Nkeneye gutekereza kubyo yavuze byose
We are too far away.	Natwe turi kure cyane.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
I see, that's right.	Njye mbona, aribyo.
You saw it inside his house.	Wabonye imbere mu nzu ye.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
I can learn to live that way	Nshobora kwiga kubaho gutya
I had a lot to think about	Nari mfite byinshi byo gutekereza
You can have everything.	Urashobora kugira byose.
I didn't feel well.	Ntabwo numvise neza.
I don’t see people very well.	Ntabwo mbona abantu cyane.
He and I.	We na njye.
I really don't deserve it.	Ntabwo rwose nkwiye.
I like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo.
It will not be tomorrow.	Ntabwo bizaba ejo.
It seems to be a mistake.	Birasa nkaho ari amakosa.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose aribyo.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
It is not a family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
I never liked things	Sinigeze nkunda ibintu
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza uburyo byagenze.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I want you to be	Ndashaka ko uri
He’s just a guy.	Ni umusore gusa.
You have a phone.	Ufite terefone.
He did wrong.	Yakoze nabi.
I didn't get a chance to go tomorrow	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe yo kugenda ejo
Sometimes eating out.	Rimwe na rimwe kurya hanze.
And he wanted to know why.	Kandi yashakaga kumenya impamvu.
But here he will be.	Ariko hano azaba.
He had no way of knowing now.	Ntabwo yari afite uburyo bwo kumenya nonaha.
But he can't see where he is.	Ariko ntashobora kubona aho ari.
I wanted to hear her hair	Nashakaga kumva umusatsi we
I don’t think much of him.	Ntabwo ntekereza cyane kuri we.
I need to know what to do from here	Nkeneye kumenya icyo gukora kuva hano
I shouldn't be in school	Ntabwo nkwiye kuba mwishuri
I wanted to leave.	Nashakaga kuva aho.
Man, but he was not there.	Umuntu, ariko ntabwo yari ahari.
Something big.	Ikintu ni kinini.
I can do nothing	Ntacyo nshobora gukora
I didn’t want to talk about this again	Sinifuzaga kongera kuvuga kuri ibi
I also hope that whatever happened was a success	Nizera kandi ko ibyo aribyo byose byagenze neza
I was not at home all day.	Umunsi wose sinari murugo.
It was great to read.	Byari byiza gusoma.
He had something to say.	Hari icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He didn't even want to see anyone.	Ntiyashakaga no kubona umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He is not sure who he is.	Ntabwo azi neza uwo ari we.
I can't go to work	Sinshobora kujyana akazi
Easy and simple.	Byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
One has to say what it is	Umuntu agomba kuvuga icyo aricyo
I never saw it yesterday	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ejo
I have to go tonight	Ngomba kugenda iri joro
I know what happened	Nzi uko byagenze
I thought he did something really good.	Natekereje ko yakoze ibintu byiza rwose.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari azi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I have to do it alone	Ngomba kubikora wenyine
She knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko umukobwa ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
And that was the movie.	Kandi yari iyo firime.
This is all he needs.	Ibi nibyo akeneye byose.
I suspect he is in his thirties	Ndakeka ko afite imyaka mirongo itatu
Until tonight.	Kugeza iri joro.
Anyway, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, yagiye.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
He feels very bad about this.	Yumva nabi cyane kuri ibi.
He was alone in the room.	Yari wenyine mu cyumba.
I don't know who he is.	Sinzi uwo ari we.
It’s not learning.	Ntabwo ari kwiga.
Not today, never.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi, nta na rimwe.
I needed something else	Nari nkeneye ikindi kintu
Only one thing is true.	Ikintu kimwe gusa ni ukuri.
It may have been a lot of things, but it wasn’t.	Ashobora kuba yari ibintu byinshi, ariko sibyo.
I should do it	Nkwiye kubikora
That's not what we need.	Ntabwo aribyo dukeneye.
You can't even tell where it is.	Ntushobora no kumenya aho ari.
I think it's something else.	Ntekereza ko ari ikindi kintu.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
And if they had.	Niba kandi bari bafite.
I really can't.	Sinshobora rwose.
These are the problems.	Ibi ni ibibazo.
He bought the children.	Yaguze abana.
You have to work alone.	Ugomba gukora akazi wenyine.
This one is for sure.	Uyu niwe rwose.
I am studying.	Ndimo kwiga.
Or very likely.	Cyangwa birashoboka cyane.
Eventually, he got what he wanted.	Amaherezo, yabonye icyo ashaka.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
Or if he saw or heard nothing.	Cyangwa niba ntacyo yabonye cyangwa yumvise.
I have to talk to you alone	Ngomba kuvugana nawe wenyine
I must have heard something	Ngomba kuba numva ikintu
It was really good for me.	Byari byiza rwose kuri njye.
I was something else	Nari ikindi kintu
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
I didn't need to look.	Sinari nkeneye kureba.
I wanted more	Nashakaga byinshi
That would be nice.	Ibyo byaba byiza.
I feel he was there.	Ndumva yari ahari.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
I even realized that at the time	Nigeze no kubona ko icyo gihe
He says everything he hears.	Avuga ibyo yumva byose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I want to be at home	Ndashaka ko murugo
You need a car.	Ukeneye imodoka.
He is not one of us.	Ntabwo ari umwe muri twe.
And that is not good.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
This was just for him.	Ibi byari kuri we gusa.
I'm sure you are	Nzi neza ko uri
I didn’t want to think	Ntabwo nashakaga gutekereza
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I had my daughter.	Nari mfite umukobwa wanjye.
I needed time to figure things out	Nari nkeneye umwanya wo kumenya ibintu
I need something big	Nkeneye ikintu kinini
I did the same thing.	Nakoze ikintu kimwe.
When he was a child.	Igihe yari akiri umwana.
Advice.	Inama.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's right, you got it right.	Nibyo, wabonye neza.
But very young.	Ariko muto cyane.
This was really good.	Ibi byari byiza rwose.
I had something else	Nari mfite ikindi kintu
I was very embarrassed	Nagize isoni nyinshi
There is more to it.	Hariho byinshi kuri byo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
I just want to help	Ndashaka gufasha gusa
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
It wasn’t just good.	Ntabwo byari byiza gusa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I can't see this	Sinshobora kubona ibi
Living together was very difficult.	Kubana byari bigoye cyane.
I can't go	Ntabwo nshobora kugenda
I need to find a friend	Ngomba kubona inshuti
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
I'm sure it's close by	Nzi neza ko iri hafi aha
He had it all.	Yari afite byose.
I like difficult things	Nkunda ibintu bigoye
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
Glad to be with her again	Nishimiye kongera kubana na we
Only in a short time.	Gusa mugihe gito.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
I need to talk to you this morning	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe muri iki gitondo
I had nothing to do with it	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo kubikora
You don't like it	Ntabwo ukunda.
I did everything	Nakoze byose
I have a walking problem	Mfite ikibazo cyo kugenda
He thought it was possible that he was upstairs.	Yatekereje ko bishoboka rwose ko yari hejuru.
I can't wait to do it	Sinshobora gutegereza kubikora
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I was not that person	Ntabwo nari uwo muntu
He finally made the choice.	Amaherezo yahisemo.
I just wanted to go to the movies	Nashakaga gusa kujya muri firime
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
It's not something you have.	Ntabwo ari ikintu ufite.
I just wanted to be close to you	Nashakaga gusa kuba hafi yawe
I didn't know enough	Ntabwo nari nzi bihagije
That's not the case now.	Ntabwo aribyo ubu.
I never really saw it	Ntabwo nigeze mbona mubyukuri
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
This is not a problem.	Iki ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I know you have a gift	Nzi ko ufite impano
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
Neither my house nor your house.	Ntabwo yaba inzu yanjye cyangwa inzu yawe.
I need to go back tonight	Nkeneye gusubira muri iri joro
He is about to leave.	Agiye kugenda.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He said nothing about school.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze ku ishuri.
I ask if he has any problems	Ndabaza niba afite ibibazo
To do so.	Kubikora.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko aribyo.
And you are going to win.	Kandi ugiye gutsinda.
You have to drive.	Ugomba gutwara.
This was a family.	Uyu wari umuryango.
He can do it on his own.	Ashobora kubikora wenyine.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I like the way you think of a guy	Nkunda uburyo utekereza umusore
I don't think he will.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko azabikora.
He thought he understood why.	Yatekereje ko yumva impamvu.
I never thought he would be here	Sinigeze ntekereza ko azaba hano
I have time.	Mfite umwanya.
I didn't want anything	Ntacyo nashakaga
I did nothing	Ntacyo nakoze
It would be nice to do it again.	Byaba byiza kongera kubikora.
I never saw that	Sinigeze mbona ibyo
He didn't really need it.	Ntabwo yari akeneye rwose.
And that was the guy.	Kandi uwo yari umusore.
I hope he does.	Ndizera ko azabikora.
Well done.	Nibyiza ariko.
I was not sure what he expected me to do	Sinigeze nzi neza icyo yari yiteze ko nkora
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Stop doing that.	Reka gukora ibyo.
You can't see.	Ntushobora kubona.
He knew exactly who to look for.	Yari azi neza uwo ashaka.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
I didn’t think, time	Ntabwo natekerezaga, igihe
I don't know why yet	Sinari nzi impamvu kugeza ubu
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
I guess everything is possible	Ndakeka ko byose bishoboka
He just knew he couldn't move.	Gusa yari azi ko adashobora kugenda.
Or for me.	Cyangwa kuri njye.
I knew he was right	Nari nzi ko avuga ukuri
I can't see where I'm making the mistake.	Sinshobora kubona aho ndimo gukora amakosa.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
I did everything right.	Nakoze byose neza.
I also did not know what he meant	Nanjye sinari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko atari byo.
I know you know where he is	Nzi ko uzi aho ari
I don't see anyone.	Nta muntu mbona.
Please let me go.	Nyamuneka reka reka.
He needed.	Yari akeneye.
This is obviously easy.	Ibi biragaragara ko byoroshye.
I really don't see it.	Ntabwo mbona rwose.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
But this is really good.	Ariko ibi rwose ni byiza.
Much like his father	Byinshi nka se
You have to look.	Ugomba kureba.
I did exactly what he told me to do.	Nakoze neza ibyo yambwiye gukora.
I think more than anyone else at home	Ntekereza ko kurenza abantu bose murugo
He was not going to tell me.	Ntabwo yari agiye kumbwira.
He never did much of that.	Ntabwo yigeze akora ikintu kinini muri byo.
I can be whatever you want	Nshobora kuba icyo ushaka cyose
He didn't want to.	Ntabwo yari yashakaga.
I can't do this alone	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ibi wenyine
I was afraid he was going to tell someone	Nagize ubwoba ko agiye kubwira umuntu
He is not the only young man.	Ntabwo ari umusore umwe wenyine.
I heard him go	Numvise agenda
I had to do something fast, everything	Nari nkwiye gukora ikintu vuba, ikintu cyose
You can't stop.	Ntushobora guhagarika.
I thought that was a good thing	Natekereje ko aricyo kintu cyiza
And with him.	Kandi hamwe na we.
We have to stay here for a while.	Tugomba kuguma hano gato.
I know everything about him	Nzi byose kuri we
He had a friend of his.	Yari afite inshuti ye.
We're not really here.	Ntabwo rwose turi hano.
I knew this was true	Nari nzi ko ibyo ari ukuri
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Really where you are.	Nukuri aho uri.
I understand exactly what he is feeling	Ndumva neza ibyo yumva
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I can't figure out the problem.	Sinshobora kumenya ikibazo.
You need to know more.	Ugomba kumenya byinshi.
I wanted something for him.	Nashakaga ikintu kuri we.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I wanted to know more, hear more	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi, kumva byinshi
I did nothing wrong	Nta kibi nakoze
But when you are young, it is possible.	Ariko uri muto, birashoboka.
He didn't know how to make a car, but he didn't need it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi cyo gukora imodoka, ariko ntiyari akeneye.
Man, it was great.	Umuntu, byari byiza.
None of this he did.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo yakoze.
Or like.	Cyangwa nka.
Now he has moved on.	Ubu yagiye imbere.
His friend was right.	Inshuti ye yari afite ukuri.
I didn’t have it for him	Ntabwo nari mfite kuri we
But he said nothing for no reason.	Ariko ntacyo yavuze nta mpamvu.
He went upstairs and said nothing.	Yagiye hejuru ntacyo avuga.
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
I have to go back outside	Ngomba gusubira hanze
Nothing, maybe.	Ntacyo, birashoboka.
And he knew what he wanted.	Kandi yari azi uko ashaka.
Most of us were.	Benshi muri twe bari.
Stop being.	Reka kuba.
Very well he knew a lot of things.	Nibyiza cyane yari azi ibintu byinshi.
He is young.	Ari muto.
I can't think of anything	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza na gato
Sometimes every night.	Rimwe na rimwe buri joro.
I was very embarrassed.	Nagize isoni cyane.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
I had thought he might be right	Nari natekereje ko bishoboka ko yari afite ukuri
But he knew the truth.	Ariko yari azi ukuri.
I wanted that.	Nashakaga ibyo.
I wanted to be inside.	Nashakaga kuba imbere.
I don't want to go!	Sinshaka kugenda!
However, it is possible.	Ariko, birashoboka.
It was not a plan	Ntabwo yari gahunda
But for everyone.	Ariko kuri buri wese.
I can catch a dog tonight	Nshobora gufata imbwa iri joro
And he meant, at the time.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga, icyo gihe.
And I want the same.	Kandi ndashaka kimwe.
I like to eat food.	Nkunda kurya ibiryo.
I was not sure he had a wife.	Sinari nzi neza ko afite umugore.
I was a small thing	Nari ikintu gito
He may not have thought about it.	Birashoboka ko atigeze atekereza kuri icyo kibazo.
I couldn't figure out who he was	Sinigeze nshobora kumenya uwo ari we
I hope you know one of them	Ndizera ko uzi kimwe muri byo
I thought it was possible	Natekerezaga ko bishoboka
I didn't see any mistakes.	Ntabwo nabonye amakosa.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose dushobora kuvuga neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I just wanted to	Nashakaga gusa
They were here before.	Bari hano mbere.
But in good times.	Ariko mugihe cyiza.
It was so beautiful, so simple, so simple and so easy in me.	Byari byiza cyane, byoroshye, byoroshye kandi byoroshye muri njye.
I had a lot of problems and not enough	Nari mfite ibibazo byinshi kandi ntabwo bihagije
I love this one.	Nkunda uyu.
He looked away.	Yarebye kure.
I have to think a little	Ngomba gutekereza gato
I want to know the same thing	Ndashaka kumenya ikintu kimwe
However, it is my fault.	Ariko, ni amakosa yanjye.
I needed to get off the bus	Nari nkeneye kuva muri bisi
He could take anything.	Yashoboraga gufata ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
He thought he was doing well.	Yatekereje ko akora neza.
His family needed money.	Umuryango we wari ukeneye amafaranga.
I was not going to see her again	Ntabwo nari ngiye kongera kubona
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
I really love your time	Nkunda rwose umwanya wawe
I didn't think so	Ntacyo natekerezaga
He knew from the first phone call.	Yari azi kuva kuri terefone ya mbere.
I saw it as a good time	Nabonye ari igihe cyiza
In fact this is not always the case.	Mubyukuri ibi ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
I want to know more about this issue	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi kuri iki kibazo
It is not his family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango we.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Only one person.	Umuntu umwe gusa.
There is a lot of money.	Hariho amafaranga menshi.
He wants to do it, right now.	Arashaka kubikora, nonaha.
The thing is.	Ikintu ni.
They were both right.	Bombi bari ukuri.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
I guess we were.	Ndakeka ko twari.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga
I'm sure you can do it	Nzi neza ko ushobora kubikora
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
We were very close at the time.	Icyo gihe twari hafi cyane.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I see nothing	Ntacyo mbona
I have to get everything right	Ngomba kubona ibintu byose neza
I want to go back to work.	Ndashaka gusubira ku kazi.
Not much, but it was a lot for him.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, ariko byari byinshi kuri we.
Children would learn to handle things.	Abana bari kwiga gufata ibintu.
Whatever you think.	Icyo utekereza cyose.
If not, it is not.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo.
For each of us he said a little thing.	Kuri buri wese muri twe yavuze ikintu gito.
I knew one thing for sure	Nari nzi ikintu kimwe rwose
I didn't have to go	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugenda
I wonder if anyone knows if that is the case.	Ndabaza niba hari uzi niba aribyo.
I hope you can do it	Nizera ko ushobora kubikora
I have never seen this problem.	Sinigeze mbona iki kibazo.
I can't see, I can't hear	Sinshobora kubona, sinshobora kumva
I didn't mean to offend you.	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga.
But the reversal is obvious.	Ariko gusubira inyuma biragaragara.
There is no going back now.	Nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
I wanted to see what you were doing	Nashakaga kureba icyo urimo gukora
I want to be a good player	Ndashaka kuba umukinnyi mwiza
I had one of them all.	Nari mfite kimwe muri byose.
I want to go back to work	Ndashaka gusubira ku kazi
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
I need to let go of things	Nkeneye kureka ibintu
I thought we could just be friends	Natekerezaga ko dushobora kuba inshuti gusa
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
Not here today.	Ntabwo ari hano muri iki gihe.
I wanted to go easy	Nashakaga kugenda byoroshye
At the time, everything was fine.	Icyo gihe byose byari byiza.
I have to do as usual	Ngomba gukora nkuko bisanzwe
He did not know many.	Ntabwo yari azi benshi.
She was very happy.	Yishimiye cyane.
I like to do things	Nkunda gukora ibintu
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
But now is the day.	Ariko ubu ni umunsi.
You can read more here.	Urashobora gusoma byinshi hano.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
I think he was scared	Ntekereza ko yari afite ubwoba
I feel close	Ndumva turi hafi
I thought you had.	Natekereje ko ufite.
I'm lucky.	Mfite amahirwe.
I wanted to do something good	Nashakaga gukora ikintu cyiza
I do not believe.	Ntabwo nizera.
I see nothing	Ntacyo mbona
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I want to talk to him	Ndashaka kuvugana na we
Large and small.	Kinini na gito.
One should not be afraid.	Umuntu ntagomba kugira ubwoba.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko hari aho hafi.
If you are listening.	Niba uri kumva.
There are people here.	Hano hari abantu.
You can have more.	Urashobora kugira byinshi.
We have a lot to do here.	Tugomba gukora byinshi hano.
It's a small issue.	Ni ikibazo gito.
That's great for me !.	Nibyiza cyane kuri njye!.
It's good every day.	Nibyiza buri munsi.
But that is possible.	Ariko ibyo birashoboka.
I was just his friend	Nari inshuti ye gusa
Well, he wanted to come here.	Nibyo, yashakaga kuza hano.
I don't see anything.	Ntabwo mbona ibyo aribyo byose.
I have to stay here with you	Ngomba kuguma hano hamwe nawe
I can't do all this alone	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ibi byose wenyine
I was so close to being scared	Nari hafi cyane yo kugira ubwoba
Down boy, down.	Hasi umuhungu, hasi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I'm down too.	Nanjye ndi hasi.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
I'm afraid there's a lot to come	Mfite ubwoba ko hari byinshi byo kuza
We were many.	Twari benshi.
They would both work.	Bombi bari gukora.
I know what he means	Nzi icyo ashaka kuvuga
He was a good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza.
But he wants to make sure that he does.	Ariko arashaka kumenya neza ko abikora.
He has heard what you have said so far.	Yumvise ibyo wavuze kugeza ubu.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
Also out.	Hanze kandi.
In all, this did not work out.	Muri byose, ibi ntabwo byagenze neza.
On the phone, on.	Kuri terefone, kuri.
At the same time,.	Igihe kimwe,.
I have to give up one day	Ngomba kureka umunsi umwe
That is my reason.	Iyo ni yo mpamvu yanjye.
That's what we needed.	Nibyo twari dukeneye.
Like.	Nkuko.
Apparently he never heard.	Biragaragara ko atigeze yumva.
In fact no one did.	Mubyukuri nta muntu wabikoze.
I did everything	Nakoze ibintu byose
And you are not alone.	Kandi si wowe wenyine.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
I can't find much.	Sinshobora kubona byinshi.
You are absolutely something.	Uri ikintu rwose.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose aribyo.
I thought all day	Natekereje umunsi wose
It was definitely a problem for me.	Rwose byari ikibazo kuri njye.
Something is as bad as possible.	Ikintu ni kibi nkuko bishoboka.
Of course, that is possible.	Nibyo rwose, ibyo birashoboka.
I wonder if we can eat this	Ndabaza niba dushobora kurya ibi
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He came out of nowhere.	Yaje ntacyo.
I was not lucky	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe
But fear.	Ariko ubwoba.
He was who he was now.	Yari uwo yari we ubu.
There is something I see here	Hano hari ikintu mbona
He thought.	Yatekerezaga.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
We need something else.	Dukeneye ikindi kintu.
Or not for a long time.	Cyangwa si igihe kirekire.
If not, it is not.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo aribyo.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora gutya.
I think that's all we can do here tonight	Ntekereza ko aribyo byose dushobora gukora hano iri joro
Anything we can get.	Ikintu cyose dushobora kubona.
Or something.	Cyangwa ikintu.
I think of my family	Ntekereza umuryango wanjye
If she has children.	Niba afite abana.
I was about to leave	Nari ngiye kugenda
When you get the chance.	Mugihe wabonye amahirwe.
But to play.	Ariko gukina.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I thought you had it	Natekereje neza ko ufite
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora gutya.
And it is probably true.	Kandi birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
Everything above.	Byose hejuru.
I want to take my wife	Ndashaka gutwara umugore wanjye
I think we have to wait	Ndatekereza ko tugomba gutegereza
I can't, I can't, I can't	Ntabwo nshobora, sinshobora, sinshobora
I don't know why here	Sinzi impamvu ari hano
They have it all.	Bafite byose.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
I felt scared.	Numvise mfite ubwoba.
Maybe you can stay for a while.	Ahari ushobora kuguma igihe gito.
You can come and see your friend tomorrow.	Urashobora kuza kureba inshuti yawe ejo.
This is probably not what you want.	Ibi birashoboka ko atari byo ushaka.
I guess it was normal	Ndakeka ko byari bisanzwe
You want a girl, any girl.	Ushaka umukobwa, umukobwa uwo ari we wese.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
I want him to feel that he is doing well	Ndashaka ko yumva ko akora neza
Something inside him.	Ikintu imbere muri we.
I want to know more here	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi hano
I know he did.	Nzi ko yabikoze.
We had a really good time.	Twari dufite byiza rwose.
I hadn't seen anything today	Ntacyo nari nabonye na gato kuri uyu munsi
I didn’t want to take a chance	Sinifuzaga gufata amahirwe
I mean he has	Ndashaka kuvuga ko afite
I need a lot of time	Nkeneye igihe kinini
No one said.	Nta n'umwe yavuze.
He could do nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga gukora.
I didn't know what to do	Sinari nzi icyo gukora
One thing is for sure.	Ikintu kimwe ni ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I think it’s my favorite movie.	Ntekereza ko ari firime yanjye nkunda.
He does a lot.	Akora byinshi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yishimiye hano.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I love that you can buy	Nkunda ko ushobora kugura
I have a lot to do and a little time	Mfite byinshi byo gukora kandi umwanya muto

I can do it one day.	Nshobora gukora umunsi umwe.
They were up, they were down.	Bari hejuru, bari munsi.
I have to live.	Ngomba kubaho.
I can't think of anything else	Sinshobora gutekereza ikindi kintu
I did a lot of that.	Nakoze byinshi muri byo.
He’s doing a lot tonight.	Arimo gukora byinshi muri iri joro.
I want to stay that way	Ndashaka kuguma uko
I know why he had to go	Nzi impamvu yagombaga kugenda
But no one had anything bad to say.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite ikintu kibi cyo kuvuga.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
I had one of those in my house	Nari mfite kimwe muri ibyo mu nzu yanjye
This is not the case here or here.	Ibi ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
No plans.	Nta gahunda.
There is nothing that one can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe umuntu ashobora gukora.
He did not have to walk alone.	Ntabwo yagombaga kugenda wenyine.
I love that person	Nkunda uwo muntu
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.

And he was not here.	Kandi ntabwo yari hano.
He says wait.	Avuga ko gutegereza.
You are not.	Ntabwo uri.
I have a meeting with him.	Mfite inama na we.
I wanted him to do something, to have something to say	Nashakaga ko agira icyo akora, kugira icyo avuga
I was well aware	Nari nzi neza
I think it's a good plan.	Ntekereza ko ari gahunda nziza.

I never thought about quitting	Sinigeze ntekereza kureka
I understand what he is up to.	Ndumva ibyo arimo.
It later became a book.	Nyuma yaje kuba igitabo.
I'm just one person	Ndi umuntu umwe gusa
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
He is a child.	Ni umwana.
All this while working.	Ibi byose mugihe ukora.
Most people have.	Abantu benshi bafite.
He thought I had seen it	Yatekereje ko nabonye
You are lucky.	Ufite amahirwe.
Probably, maybe, maybe.	Birashoboka, ahari, ahari.
I didn’t want to do this	Sinifuzaga gukora ibi

You really are not like him.	Ntabwo rwose uri nka we.

She is really scared.	Afite ubwoba rwose.
He must.	Agomba.
It will not be good but it will be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza ariko bizaba byiza.
She was a wise woman.	Yari umugore uzi ubwenge.
I didn’t want to carry too much stuff	Sinifuzaga gutwara ibintu byinshi cyane
I guess it was normal.	Ndakeka ko byari bisanzwe.
They were human.	Bari abantu.
He saw it all on his own.	Yabonye byose wenyine.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I want to know the truth	Ndashaka kumenya ukuri
He must be alone.	Agomba kuba wenyine wenyine.

You are very close.	Uri hafi cyane.

And that's great	Kandi nibyiza cyane

Drinking would be better now	Kunywa byaba byiza ubu
It was too far.	Yari kure cyane.
They wouldn't say much.	Ntabwo bari kuvuga byinshi.
I want to, but not here	Ndashaka, ariko ntabwo ari hano
We need more gifts.	Dukeneye impano nyinshi.
You are one.	Uri umwe.

I didn't know why at the time	Sinari nzi impamvu icyo gihe
He has a good job.	Afite akazi neza.
The family works, maybe.	Umuryango ukora, birashoboka.
He is confident that he has done so.	Yizeye neza ko yabikoze.
You have to read this.	Ugomba gusoma ibi.
What does he know.	Ni iki azi.
I hope everything is fine	Ndizera ko byose ari byiza
Sometimes it was difficult.	Rimwe na rimwe byari bigoye.

But there is something.	Ariko hariho ikintu.

Nothing to buy.	Nta kintu cyo kugura.
Your luck, really.	Amahirwe yawe, mubyukuri.
She wanted a baby more than anything else.	Yashakaga umwana kuruta ikindi kintu cyose.
I love schedules and schedules	Nkunda gahunda na gahunda
She was my wife.	Yari umugore wanjye.
More food, less time.	Ibiryo byinshi, umwanya muto.
No one did it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
And that's the thing.	Kandi icyo ni cyo kintu.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
You have to be good.	Ugomba kuba mwiza.
Big question.	Ikibazo kinini.
I know nothing about him	Ntacyo nzi kuri we
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko byari byiza
He found school difficult and often had problems	Yabonye ishuri bigoye kandi yakundaga kugira ibibazo
He is looking for someone.	Arashaka umuntu.

I thought you might have done it.	Natekereje ko ushobora kuba wabikoze.
But he did not want to stay there.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kuguma aho.
I had an idea where he might be.	Nari mfite igitekerezo aho ashobora kuba.
But now we have to buy.	Ariko ubu tugomba kugura.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
You can be a girl.	Urashobora kuba umukobwa.

And where was he now.	Kandi yari he ubu.
However, that is not all.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo byose.

Now my hair is beautiful.	Ubu umusatsi wanjye ni mwiza.

The dog is cute.	Imbwa ni nziza.
I can't go back to prison	Sinshobora gusubira muri gereza
He was lucky.	Yari afite amahirwe.
I feel something behind me	Numva ikintu inyuma yanjye
Or, not at all.	Cyangwa, sibyo.
He thought I didn't know enough.	Yatekereje ko ntazi bihagije.
I didn’t know what he might be doing	Sinari nzi icyo ashobora kuba akora
I never saw you look good.	Sinigeze mbona ko usa neza.

Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.

But he would hear nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yari kumva.
And he will do it.	Kandi azabikora.
Since then	Kuva icyo gihe.
At the time, that was not the case.	Icyo gihe ntabwo byari ukuri.
And he was beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza.
I want to be that way	Ndashaka kuba uko
But not here.	Ariko ntabwo ari hano.

That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Watching people.	Kureba abantu.
And, he was a really good guy.	Kandi, yari umusore mwiza rwose.
Quit.	Kureka.
You can win.	Urashobora gutsinda.
And that’s fine, for me.	Kandi ni byiza, kuri njye.

I just thought about it	Gusa natekereje hejuru
I was scared	Nari mfite ubwoba
He did.	Yabikoze.
I'm worried about everything	Mfite impungenge kuri byose
It's not my time to say that.	Ntabwo ari umwanya wanjye wo kuvuga iki.
I'm not sure where.	Sinzi neza aho.
All this waiting.	Ibi byose byo gutegereza.
You can't say much.	Ntushobora kuvuga byinshi.
Maybe he knows something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo azi.
I really think they would make a good book	Ndatekereza rwose ko bari gukora igitabo cyiza
I always thought he was a boy	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko ari umuhungu
It is best to buy only what you need.	Nibyiza kugura ibyo ukeneye gusa.
I can get out of here	Nshobora kuva aha
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Not really, really.	Ntabwo aribyo cyane, mubyukuri.
I'm happy for both of you.	Nishimiye bombi.
I hope he enjoyed this one	Nizere ko yishimiye iyi
I thought about going home	Natekereje gutaha
He could have easily let go of the problem.	Yashoboraga kureka byoroshye kureka ikibazo.
I never wanted to go back down	Sinigeze nshaka gusubira hasi
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.

I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo.
I want to be beautiful	Ndashaka kuba mwiza
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
He was terrified, this one.	Yagize ubwoba, uyu.
We have to wait.	Tugomba gutegereza.
I wanted to look away	Nashakaga kureba kure
I think so.	Ndatekereza ko aribyo.
I want to know everything	Ndashaka kumenya byose
I doubt he had a party	Ndashidikanya ko yagize ibirori
I want to know how	Ndashaka kumenya uko
I did nothing	Ntacyo nakoze
But he meant.	Ariko yashakaga kuvuga.
I can't be.	Ntabwo nshobora kuba.
I don't want that.	Sinshaka ko ibyo.
I'm worried about him.	Mfite impungenge kuri we.
I just didn’t get the time	Gusa sinigeze mbona umwanya
It was good at the time.	Icyo gihe byari byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I really need to talk to someone	Nkeneye rwose kuvugana numuntu
I know exactly what you mean	Nzi neza icyo ushaka kuvuga
The problem is that the girl was a boy.	Ikibazo nuko umukobwa yahoze ari umuhungu.
I need to think clearly	Nkeneye gutekereza neza
We were not.	Ntabwo twari twe.
And very young.	Kandi muto cyane.
I wanted to quit my job	Nashakaga kureka akazi
I mean, he wanted to know why	Ndashaka kuvuga, yashakaga kumenya impamvu
But it is small.	Ariko ni muto.
More than learning.	Kurenza kwiga.
I wanted to go as fast as possible	Nashakaga kugenda vuba bishoboka
Not everything is what you think it would be.	Ntabwo byose aribyo utekereza ko byaba.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
And that is a good thing for me.	Kandi ibyo ni ibintu byiza kuri njye.
He thinks he understands.	Yibwira ko yumva.
Just with you.	Gusa hamwe nawe.
It was very easy for him.	Kuri we byari byoroshye cyane.
I was not sure how that was possible	Sinari nzi neza uko ibyo bishoboka
You do what you want.	Ukora ibyo ushaka.
I never saw that.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ibyo.
It was his money.	Yari amafaranga ye.
I wasn't sure if this was a good idea	Ntabwo nari nzi neza ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza
I don't want to talk to you	Sinshaka kuvugana nawe
What they had now was good for both of them.	Ibyo bari bafite ubu, byari byiza kuri bombi.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
In fact, let it go.	Mubyukuri, reka reka.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo cyiza.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
I think we can do that	Ntekereza ko dushobora kubikora
Probably my favorite.	Birashoboka ko aribyo nkunda.
We are a small family.	Turi umuryango muto.
I thought, the food would be good.	Natekereje, ibiryo byaba byiza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
And he does it one day a week.	Kandi abikora umunsi umwe mu cyumweru.
He knows a lot.	Azi byinshi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He was, just not close enough.	Yari, gusa ntabwo yari hafi bihagije.
Or at work.	Cyangwa ku kazi.
I want to learn things	Ndashaka kwiga ibintu
I never heard much of him	Ntabwo nigeze numva ibintu byinshi muri we
And it’s not just an opportunity.	Kandi ntabwo ari amahirwe gusa.
I need to look very far	Nkeneye kureba kure cyane
And it is possible that he had gone too far.	Kandi birashoboka ko yari yagiye kure cyane.
But here it is.	Ariko ari hano.
Questions he never thought of.	Ibibazo atigeze atekereza.
I needed to think fast	Nari nkeneye gutekereza vuba
It's a good phone.	Ni terefone nziza.
But no one is ahead.	Ariko nta n'umwe uri imbere.
Really, well.	Mubyukuri, neza.
Alone.	Wenyine.
So far so good.	Kugeza vuba aha nibyo.
This was definitely a mistake.	Ibi rwose byari amakosa.
It’s not just money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga gusa.
You don't have to be here.	Ntagomba kuba hano.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I want to know what the plan is	Ndashaka kumenya gahunda icyo aricyo
I doubt that is true.	Ndashidikanya ko ibyo ari ukuri.
He said he was.	Yavuze ko ari.
I should have been scared	Nari nkwiye kugira ubwoba
I'm close now.	Ndi hafi ubu.
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
Sometimes things go awry.	Rimwe na rimwe ibintu byagenze nabi.
You may think.	Urashobora gutekereza.
She was no longer my child.	Ntabwo yari akiri umwana wanjye.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
I’m worse than you have any idea.	Ndi mubi cyane kuruta uko ufite igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
This was for him.	Ibi byari kuri we.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
I want to be with you whenever possible	Ndashaka kubana nawe igihe cyose bishoboka
He thought quickly.	Yatekereje vuba.
There is no truth in truth.	Nta kuri kuri kuri.
That’s not how he might have hoped.	Ntabwo ari uburyo ashobora kuba yari yizeye.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He had no problem finding a house that day.	Uwo munsi nta kibazo yagize cyo kubona inzu.
But, we are really close.	Ariko, turi hafi rwose.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I want to play with you a lot	Ndashaka gukina nawe byinshi
Me? 	Ninjye?
he said.	yavuze.
I knew it was the room	Nari nzi ko aricyo cyumba
I don't want to say that	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga ibyo
I should have been friends	Nari nkwiye kuba inshuti
But it wasn’t just his car.	Ariko ntabwo yari imodoka ye gusa.
I did a lot after eating	Nakoze byinshi nyuma yo kurya
I know he is right	Nzi ko avuga ukuri
Probably, however.	Birashoboka, ariko.
I want to be as good as ever.	Ndashaka kuba mwiza nkuko bisanzwe.
It was the clothes they had.	Ni imyenda bari bafite.
I am your wife.	Ndi umugore wawe.
I mean stay here	Ndashaka kuvuga kuguma hano
Not good enough today.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije muri iki gihe.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
I am learning so much	Ndimo kwiga byinshi cyane
He never thought he would do it.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ko azabikora koko.
I love friends.	Nishimiye inshuti.
Only, in fact.	Gusa, mubyukuri.
He did not hear what he was saying.	Ntiyigeze yumva ibyo yavuze.
She loved being with us	Yakundaga kubana natwe
And you knew he would do it.	Kandi wari uziko azabikora.
And he knew they had something to do with it.	Kandi yamenye ko bafite icyo bafite.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly	Birashoboka ko nari nzi mbere yuko abikora
They would not return.	Ntabwo bari gusubira.
We can't wait to see more about him.	Ntidushobora gutegereza kubona byinshi kuri we.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
I needed to stop that	Nari nkeneye guhagarika ibyo
I think maybe he was right	Ntekereza ko ahari yari afite ukuri
I found out how true it was, almost everything	Nabonye uburyo wari ukuri, hafi ya byose
He never, ever, ever did.	Ntiyigeze, nta na rimwe, nta na rimwe yigeze akora.
He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kugenda.
There is a teacher	Hariho umwarimu
I want to be me	Ndashaka kuba njye
No thinking right now.	Nta gutekereza neza kuri ubu.
That was my plan.	Iyo yari gahunda yanjye.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
Learning a person.	Kwiga umuntu.
Very lucky.	Amahirwe cyane.
I heard this.	Numvise ibi.
I was not only good.	Ntabwo nari mwiza gusa.
I don’t think we have a front like him.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko dufite imbere nka we.
His daughter came after him.	Umukobwa we yaje inyuma ye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibyo ntacyo byari, ntacyo.
I mean, everything he said was true	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibyo yavuze byose byari ukuri
It was worse than that.	Yari mubi kuruta ibyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I just wanted to be with you	Nashakaga gusa kubana nawe
I really want to read this	Ndashaka rwose gusoma iyi
He understands everything.	Yumva byose.
But we are very close.	Ariko turi hafi cyane.
But he is out.	Ariko ari hanze.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I don't think that will be the case.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko bizaba impamvu.
I'm not happy.	Ntabwo nishimiye.
You should not feel bad or ashamed.	Ntugomba kumva nabi cyangwa isoni.
I mean, with everything	Ndashaka kuvuga, hamwe na byose
I think he found a good wife	Ntekereza ko yabonye umugore mwiza
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
I don’t trust people that easily.	Ntabwo nizera abantu byoroshye.
But not tonight.	Ariko si iri joro.
To drink	Kunywa.
He would be here now.	Yaba ari hano ubu.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I can't do things	Sinshobora gukora ibintu
You have it all.	Ufite byose.
And that was outside	Kandi ibyo byari hanze
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo gukora.
I think this is just something for him	Ntekereza ko iki ari ikintu kuri we gusa
I want to take this time to talk	Ndashaka gufata iki gihe cyo kuvuga
It was money.	Byari amafaranga.
I didn't want to	Ntabwo nashakaga
Any of these are good.	Icyo ari cyo cyose muri byo ni byiza.
You have nothing.	Ntacyo ufite.
Bose.	Bose.
He needed to be close to everyone.	Yari akeneye kuba hafi ya bose.
He had faith.	Yari afite kwizera.
I had the same problem	Nanjye nagize ikibazo kimwe
I saw my friend sitting nearby	Nabonye inshuti yanjye yicaye hafi
He did it, no problem.	Yabikoze, nta kibazo.
They know everything.	Bazi byose.
Only on and on no.	Gusa kuri no kuri no.
There is.	Hariho.
I never wanted to be one	Sinigeze nshaka kuba umwe
I can eat good food	Nshobora kurya ibiryo byiza
Or, maybe, especially that.	Cyangwa, ahari, cyane cyane ibyo.
Same problem, though.	Ikibazo kimwe, naho.
No big deal.	Nta kibazo kinini.
Not yet.	Ntabwo kugeza ubu.
If you are a woman.	Niba uri umugore.
I never thought that	Sinigeze ntekereza ko
I don't feel like him	Ntacyo numva nka we
He never did.	Ntiyigeze akora.
For one of them.	Kuri kimwe muri byo.
I can see that.	Nshobora kubona ibyo.
Something he saw.	Ikintu yabonye.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
Whether at home.	Yaba ari murugo.
I wanted to talk to you alone	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe wenyine
For me, I feel at home.	Kuri njye, numva ari murugo.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Well, that's not what happened.	Nibyiza, ntabwo aribyo byagenze.
For him, for both.	Kuri we, kuri bombi.
I needed more.	Nari nkeneye byinshi.
He is not a dog at the time.	Ntabwo ari imbwa icyo gihe.
I was a tennis expert	Nari umuhanga muri tennis
He was close to her.	Yari hafi ye.
I want to be us.	Ndashaka kuba twe.
But that was good.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza.
This is not the kind of help he needs.	Ubu ntabwo ari ubufasha akeneye.
I was scared to eat	Nari mfite ubwoba bwo kurya
I like it very much.	Nkunda neza.
At the moment.	Kuri iki gihe.
And, as it turned out.	Kandi, uko byagenze.
I don't want to do it again	Sinshaka kongera kubikora
I hope he will be one.	Ndizera ko azaba umwe.
It was a good thing to do.	Byari ibintu byiza gukora.
He needs to find time.	Akeneye kubona umwanya.
I want to talk to you later	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe nyuma
He says we are far away.	Avuga ko turi kure cyane.
I should do something	Nkwiye kugira icyo nkora
He wanted to.	Ni we yashakaga.
I knew he had.	Nari nzi ko afite.
I need to find something	Nkeneye kubona ikintu
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I can't say anything else	Sinshobora kuvuga ikindi
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo byose.
Everything I need to see ?.	Ibintu byose nkeneye kureba?.
But he knew the same thing.	Ariko yari azi ikintu kimwe.
It was not difficult to do.	Ntabwo byari bigoye gukora.
I was just scared	Nagize ubwoba gusa
He seemed to want to talk.	Yasaga naho ashaka kuvuga.
I didn't have one	Ntabwo nari mfite
Lots.	Byinshi.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
The work is too early for that.	Akazi kare cyane kubyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I know you can do the same	Nzi ko nawe ushobora kubikora
I didn’t know many people	Ntabwo nari nzi abantu benshi
Winning is not the case.	Gutsinda ntabwo aribyo.
I wanted my time	Nashakaga umwanya wanjye
In fact it is possible.	Mubyukuri birashoboka.
We were too many.	Twari benshi cyane.
And he can't either.	Kandi na we ntashobora.
We.	Ni.
People like him.	Abantu nka we.
I want to read.	Ndashaka gusoma.
Your money is your money.	Amafaranga yawe ni amafaranga yawe.
I needed time to think	Nari nkeneye umwanya wo gutekereza
I can't stop talking	Sinshobora guhagarika kuvuga
He had a nice house.	Yari afite inzu nziza.
You have to know what to do.	Ugomba kumenya icyo gukora.
I don’t have to do it alone.	Ntabwo ngomba kubikora wenyine.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu ntabwo yari afite.
And it is not easy.	Kandi ntabwo byoroshye.
I'm sure you have a lot to say	Nzi neza ko ufite byinshi byo kuvuga
I wanted to stay together	Nashakaga kuguma hamwe
I shouldn't have come here	Sinari nkwiye kuza hano
He was there before.	Yari ahari mbere.
I can't see well	Sinshobora kubona neza
Another thing to think about.	Ikindi kintu cyo gutekereza.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
Definitely not today.	Rwose ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I need to do this alone	Nkeneye gukora ibi wenyine
I thought he was gone	Natekereje ko yagiye
You have to be together.	Ugomba kuba hamwe.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
Big question, maybe.	Ikibazo kinini, birashoboka.
He never heard of anything.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo yigeze yumva.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
This one had hair.	Uyu yari afite umusatsi.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
He was behind her.	Yari inyuma ye.
He was my friend.	Yari inshuti yanjye.
Something we have to do.	Ikintu tugomba gukora.
I never saw it	Nta na rimwe nigeze mbona
I was out	Nari hanze
There are so many things we can do here.	Hano hari ibintu byinshi dushobora gukora hano.
I wanted more for me than anything else	Nashakaga ko kuri njye kuruta ikindi kintu cyose
I feel the same way	Ndumva ari kimwe
I'm not sure if that's true.	Ntabwo mbona neza uko ibyo ari ukuri.
I can't figure out who I believe	Sinshobora kumenya uwo nizera
I think he plans to talk to you	Ntekereza ko ateganya kuvugana nawe
I don't believe he ever came after you	Ntabwo nizera ko yaje nyuma yawe rwose
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He wanted something else.	Yashakaga ikindi kintu.
A small question	Ikibazo gito
I don’t know why or how or what.	Ntabwo nzi impamvu cyangwa uburyo cyangwa ikindi.
He is.	Ni we.
He didn't need to wait long.	Ntabwo yari akeneye gutegereza igihe kirekire.
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
I want to go home.	Ndashaka gutaha.
And there is no waiting room.	Kandi nta cyumba cyo gutegereza.
And it will be what you do.	Kandi bizaba ibyo ukora.
I can't do anything right	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ikintu na kimwe neza
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I really needed it	Nari nkeneye cyane
I need to talk to you	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe
I want the truth.	Ndashaka ukuri.
I didn't know where he was	Sinari nzi aho ari
He did not ask for anything.	Ntacyo yasabye.
I just want to see a boy	Ndashaka gusa kureba umuhungu
He could say nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kuvuga.
I have to see things together.	Ngomba kubona ibintu hamwe.
I am your new friend	Ndi inshuti yawe nshya
I saw the same thing	Nabonye ikintu kimwe
Just one.	Umwe gusa.
I'm glad to be your daughter	Nishimiye kuba umukobwa wawe
The car is the car.	Imodoka ni imodoka.
The child did very well.	Umwana yakoze neza cyane.
Luckily he didn't mean to offend me	Nagize amahirwe ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga ko nta kibi
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
I was not sure what he wanted	Sinari nzi neza icyo yashakaga
I know who you are.	Nzi uwo uri we.
I understand everything now	Ndumva byose ubu
And friends are.	Kandi inshuti ni.
'	'
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
I have it all	Mfite byose
Sometimes it was down, sometimes up.	Rimwe na rimwe yari munsi, rimwe na rimwe hejuru.
I told no one	Nta muntu nabwiye
I did not have a close family	Ntabwo nari mfite umuryango wa hafi
I am currently reading the last book	Ubu ndimo gusoma igitabo cya nyuma
I never wanted to leave prison	Sinigeze nshaka kuva muri gereza
He had to think.	Yagombaga gutekereza.
Little did I know that would happen	Sinari nzi ko ibyo byari kubaho
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
It would be nice for him.	Byaba byiza kuri we.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
I thought about it a lot	Natekereje kuri byinshi
In the end it was too much, I couldn't see.	Amaherezo byari byinshi cyane, ntashobora kubona.
I should have helped	Nari nkwiye gufasha
I wonder how long he has been here alone	Ndabaza igihe yamaze hano wenyine
I noticed that he also heard something	Nabonye ko nawe hari icyo yumvise
'	'
A lot to do.	Byinshi byo gukora.
Like me	Nkanjye nkanjye.
I guess that's right	Ndakeka ko aribyo aribyo
I never saw him around	Sinigeze mbona hafi ye
I think it would be great.	Ntekereza ko byari kuba byiza.
I heard everything	Numvise ibintu byose
Everything was fine for me.	Ibintu byose byari byiza kuri njye.
I want something long, but not long	Ndashaka ikintu kirekire, ariko ntabwo ari kirekire
I wasn’t going to do it	Sinari ngiye kubikora
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
Up.	Hejuru.
Who are you	Ninde uri.
I think that will be enough	Ntekereza ko ibyo bizaba bihagije
He saw nothing and no one.	Nta kintu yabonye kandi nta muntu.
I think you really have to go for thirty years.	Ndatekereza ko rwose ugomba kugenda imyaka mirongo itatu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
Sometimes it looks good, sometimes it is good.	Rimwe na rimwe birasa neza, rimwe na rimwe ni byiza.
I don't see my daughter at all.	Ntabwo mbona umukobwa wanjye rwose.
I really needed to do more	Nari nkeneye rwose gukora byinshi
I didn't have to go	Sinari nkwiye kugenda
I really did	Nakoze rwose
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
There is only one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I guess that was the case.	Ndakeka ko byari ibintu.
I am very worried.	Mfite impungenge cyane.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
I hope no one has ever heard of it.	Ndizera ko nta muntu numwe wigeze yumva.
I was looking for a party.	Nashakaga ibirori.
You have to.	Ugomba.
I didn't think about that.	Ntabwo natekereje kuri ibyo.
Someone is swimming.	Umuntu arimo koga.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I should have heard	Nari nkwiye kumva
I never saw him	Sinigeze mbona na we
I was not sure why	Sinari nzi neza impamvu
I never heard what he said, if anything.	Sinigeze numva ibyo yavuze, niba hari icyo.
I can’t just walk away with nothing	Sinshobora kugenda gusa nta kintu
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu byagenze neza.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
Yes, they are very close.	Nibyo, bari hafi cyane.
He was there too.	Na we yari ahari.
I need help	Nkeneye kubona ubufasha
I can't talk to you.	Sinshobora kuvugana nawe.
Anyone can have an opinion.	Umuntu wese arashobora kugira igitekerezo.
One has to.	Umuntu agomba.
I ask everything	Ndabaza byose
He didn't want to go far.	Ntiyashakaga kujya kure.
I can't see anything, but it's good	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu, ariko nibyiza
I hope this is a difficult task!	Nizera ko ibi ari ibintu bigoye gukora!
I know the house.	Nzi inzu.
I was just a guy who said, everyone	Nari umusore gusa wavuze, abantu bose
We have all day.	Dufite umunsi wose.
He needs more.	Akeneye byinshi.
I work for a long time.	Nkora igihe kirekire.
He was finally ready.	Amaherezo yari yiteguye.
I didn’t want to be that person	Sinifuzaga kuba uwo muntu
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
I was human	Nari umuntu
He wants to know if this is true.	Ashaka kumenya niba aribyo koko.
I am very home now	Ubu ndi murugo cyane
It would be a great day.	Byari kuba umunsi mwiza.
They are worried.	Bafite impungenge.
I knew nothing	Ntacyo nari nzi
I have, this is the way	Mfite, ubu ni uburyo
He needed to tell someone.	Yari akeneye kubwira umuntu.
It's the same with him.	Birasa na we.
But that is not a good reason.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari impamvu nziza.
He heard nothing.	Nta cyo yumvise.
One is his age.	Umwe ni imyaka ye.
Nothing for me.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri njye.
We are in fact.	Turi mubyukuri.
He could have.	Yashoboraga kugira.
I know he was your friend	Nzi ko yari inshuti yawe
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
Very likely	Birashoboka cyane
But it is not the same as living.	Ariko ntabwo ari kimwe no kubaho.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I can't find a job	Sinshobora kubona akazi
And we had a lot.	Kandi twari dufite byinshi.
I never heard of him	Sinigeze numva na we
I was very young.	Nari muto cyane.
No problem here.	Nta kibazo hano.
He was gone.	Yari amaze kugenda.
I never heard him speak	Sinigeze numva ibyo avuga
If not large.	Niba atari kinini.
Someone had already done that.	Umuntu yari amaze kubikora.
But he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ariko yari azi neza ko byari kugenda.
I do not understand	Ntabwo ndumva
He had enough of that.	Yari afite ibyo bihagije.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
He says that's it.	Avuga ko aribyo.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
I felt scared for the first time	Numvise ubwoba bwa mbere
Most of it, that's right.	Byinshi muri byo, nibyo.
I only knew one thing	Nari nzi ikintu kimwe gusa
And you don't have to do that.	Kandi ntugomba kubikora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I just wanted to be with him.	Nashakaga gusa kubana na we.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I can't do it here	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora hano
I mean really today.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri iki gihe.
He is now a young man.	Ubu ni umuntu muto.
He was not around.	Ntiyari hafi.
I mean, please.	Ndashaka kuvuga, nyamuneka.
He could say nothing, he could do nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kuvuga, nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
One of those.	Kimwe muri ibyo.
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri ibyo
I have something else to do today	Mfite ikindi kintu cyo gukora uyu munsi
I can't say anything else	Sinshobora kuvuga ikindi
I mean we can help now	Ndashaka kuvuga ko dushobora gufasha ubu
You are scared alone.	Ufite ubwoba wenyine.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
We have to do what we have.	Tugomba gukora ibyo dufite.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
He is very close.	Ari hafi cyane.
No purchase.	Nta kugura.
I didn’t really think about that	Ntabwo rwose natekerezaga kuri ibyo
I was never ashamed	Sinigeze numva isoni
But he is worried.	Ariko afite impungenge.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
I didn’t get a chance to say much	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kuvuga byinshi
This is only possible when you think you are beautiful.	Ibi birashoboka gusa mugihe utekereza ko uri mwiza.
That too.	Uwo na we.
He told his children.	Yavuze abana be.
I’m sure he wants an idea	Nzi neza ko yifuza igitekerezo
You are a good child.	Uri umwana mwiza.
I need to think fast	Nkeneye gutekereza vuba
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I think it's better than what he likes	Ntekereza ko ari byiza kuruta ibyo akunda
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I needed to talk to someone.	Nari nkeneye kuvugana numuntu.
I can't say that	Sinshobora kuvuga kuri ibyo
I love everyone here	Nkunda abantu bose hano
But now it looks very bad.	Ariko ubu birasa nabi cyane.
Where it went wrong.	Aho byagenze nabi.
So many, in fact.	Benshi cyane, mubyukuri.
I didn't mean to offend	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga icyo gihe
But getting things right.	Ariko kubona ibintu neza.
What he would do.	Icyo yari gukora.
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
You are not sure if this is possible today.	Ntabwo uzi neza ko bishoboka muri iki gihe.
It is not a good time for me.	Ntabwo ari igihe cyiza kuri njye.
It was a great idea.	Byari igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
I think so.	Ntekereza ko aribyo.
He had to think quickly.	Yagombaga gutekereza vuba.
It won't be much.	Ntabwo bizaba byinshi.
I never loved anyone	Sinigeze nkunda umuntu
I mean, he's here	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari hano
I'm sure we can do that.	Nzi neza ko dushobora kubikora.
I had nothing.	Nta na kimwe nari mfite.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
It was good though	Byari byiza ariko
I think a lot about that.	Ntekereza byinshi kuri ibyo.
I don't know who he was then.	Sinzi uwo ari we icyo gihe.
He’s doing well, it’s really good.	Arimo akora neza, nibyiza rwose.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
He didn’t do it for a long time.	Ntabwo yakoze igihe kirekire.
I like to treat people well	Nkunda gufata abantu neza
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko uri ukora.
For all of us.	Kuri twese.
I think he knows something	Ntekereza ko hari icyo azi
I can't look again.	Sinshobora kongera kureba.
I really did.	Nakoze rwose.
I wanted to get out of here	Nashakaga kuva hano
But this one.	Ariko iyi.
It's not scary, it's true.	Ntabwo ari ubwoba, ni ukuri.
He looked more like me than me.	Yasaga nkanjye kundusha.
And that would be great.	Kandi ibyo byaba byiza.
Ari, ni.	Ari, ni.
He is alone.	Ari wenyine.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
None of us had.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari ufite.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
In this world.	Muri iyi si.
I should have been scared	Nari nkwiye kugira ubwoba
It was not for me.	Ntabwo byari kuri njye.
You have to be here.	Ugomba kuba hano.
I can't do this.	Sinshobora gukora ibi.
I never made a movie soon.	Ntabwo nigeze nkora firime vuba.
I know my phone is alone	Nzi ko terefone yanjye ari wenyine
I understand what you mean	Ndumva icyo ushaka kuvuga
I know what you mean now	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga ubu
We need more time to study.	Dukeneye igihe kinini cyo kwiga.
He is in his room.	Ari mu cyumba cye.
I really have to go	Ngomba rwose kugenda
He is not ready.	Ntabwo yiteguye.
You think it's true.	Utekereza ko ari ukuri.
It's not close enough.	Ntabwo ari hafi bihagije.
He doesn't have to wait for anything else.	Ntagomba gutegereza ikindi kintu kuri we.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
They were close.	Bari hafi.
You want to do something.	Urashaka gukora ikintu.
It will be.	Bizaba.
When you do something, there is just something to do.	Iyo ukora ikintu, hariho ibyo gukora gusa.
I thought	Natekereje
I really want to do it.	Ndashaka rwose kubikora.
I think there is a lot that can be done	Ntekereza ko hari byinshi bishoboka
I understand why.	Ndumva impamvu.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
I need to leave	Nkeneye kuva aho
He seemed reluctant.	Yasaga naho adashaka.
Your family.	Umuryango wawe.
There is no turning back.	Nta gusubira inyuma.
I'm sure his father is	Nzi neza ko se ari we
I didn't hear anything back	Ntacyo numvise inyuma
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.

I wanted to believe that it was.	Nashakaga kwizera ko aribyo.
I always thought it was me.	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko ari njye.
They wouldn't tell me anything, though.	Ntacyo bari kumbwira, ariko.

I'm sure you can.	Nzi neza ko ushobora.
I just want to know why	Ndashaka kuki gusa
He had a way.	Yari afite uburyo.
He did nothing.	Ntiyigeze agira icyo akora.
Faith is not true	Kwizera ntabwo ari ukuri
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari cyane.
I think he knows more than he says	Ntekereza ko azi byinshi kuruta ibyo avuga
I'm glad to be of help.	Nishimiye kuba ubufasha.
I didn't hear anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise.
It's a good plan.	Ni gahunda nziza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
I knew everything I needed to know	Nari nzi ibyo nkeneye kumenya byose
He got what he wanted	Yabonye icyo yashakaga
But he would have nothing.	Ariko nta na kimwe yari kugira.
I found the problem here.	Nabonye ikibazo hano.
He thought both of them.	Yatekereje ko bombi.
He wants anything.	Arashaka ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I believe he was right	Nizera ko yavuze ukuri
But he was scared.	Ariko yagize ubwoba.
I have to do it.	Ngomba kubikora.
You are.	Urimo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Here.	Ibi.
You have to talk to him.	Ugomba kuvugana na we.
I should have known, younger	Nari nkwiye kumenya, muto
Maybe we were.	Birashoboka ko twari.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
And sometimes that's not the case.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe ntabwo ari icyo gihe.
He must be present.	Agomba kuba ahari.
I want to be with you.	Ndashaka kubana nawe.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
I needed a little time	Nari nkeneye umwanya muto
You can be one of us.	Urashobora kuba umwe muri twe.
I should have come early	Nari nkwiye kuza kare
Outside, but inside out.	Inyuma yo hanze, ariko imbere imbere.
I should have gone.	Nari nkwiye kujyana.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
His luck had come.	Amahirwe ye yari yaje.
I saw something outside	Nabonye ikintu hanze
He was worried about her.	Yari afite impungenge kuri we.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
I think you did	Ndatekereza ko wabikoze
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
And he meant.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga.
I needed to know why.	Nari nkeneye kumenya impamvu.
It's really easy.	Byoroshye rwose.
I can't figure out why that would be.	Sinshobora kubona impamvu ibyo byaba.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
He just needed time, he chose.	Yari akeneye igihe gusa, yahisemo.
Thirty years.	Imyaka mirongo itatu.
And people were having problems.	Kandi abantu bari bafite ibibazo.
I don't know what he agreed to.	Ntazi icyo yemeye.
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
In fact, it's good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza.
I know that is a good thing for me.	Nzi ko aricyo kintu cyiza kuri njye.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
I need a little time	Nkeneye igihe gito
He looked frightened.	Yarebye afite ubwoba.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
I'm not sure he did.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko yabikoze.
I didn't think it would be so difficult	Sinatekerezaga ko byari kuba bigoye rwose
Problems at home.	Ibibazo murugo.
I thought the idea was good.	Natekereje ko igitekerezo ari cyiza.
I can do the job quickly	Nshobora gukora akazi vuba
Shouldn’t you have ?.	Ntugomba kuba ufite?.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I was beautiful.	Nari mwiza.
I just knew he would do it	Nari nzi gusa ko azabikora
What did I do? 	Nakoze iki?
'nothing'.	'ntacyo'.
He is also me.	Ni we kandi nanjye ndi njye.
I had something to look down on a boy	Nari mfite ikintu cyo kureba hasi umuhungu
But so did you.	Ariko nawe ni ko wari.
I was very close.	Nari hafi cyane.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
I need only time to think	Nkeneye umwanya wenyine wo gutekereza
One thing, though.	Ikintu kimwe, naho.
There is so much to think about and think about.	Hariho byinshi byo gutekereza no gutekereza.
My favorite thing is this one.	Ikintu nkunda cyane ni iyi.
I am a good boy now.	Ubu ndi umuhungu mwiza.
He was now very young.	Ubu yari muto cyane.
You need to know more.	Ugomba kumenya byinshi.
I don't think he knew anything.	Ntekereza ko ntacyo yari azi.
The car is something.	Imodoka ni ikintu.
It's great to be home.	Nibyiza cyane gutaha.
But there is more here.	Ariko hano hari byinshi.
We have food outside.	Dufite ibiryo hanze.
I didn't know it was going to happen so fast.	Ntabwo nari nzi ko byari kugenda vuba cyane.
And he was right about what he said.	Kandi yari afite ukuri ku byo yavuze.
We have to think about the plan.	Tugomba gutekereza kuri gahunda.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ikintu kibi
When he is here.	Iyo ari hano.
I did something good	Nakoze ikintu cyiza
I just wanted him to be a good boy.	Nashakaga gusa ko aba umuhungu mwiza.
Not all of us can.	Ntabwo natwe twese dushobora.
I needed to know what had happened	Nari nkeneye kumenya uko byagenze
Good vision.	Kubona neza.
Bose.	Bose.
He was not lucky.	Ntabwo yari afite amahirwe.
I know it's close	Nzi ko ari hafi
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
I know he's gone, but it's possible	Nzi ko yagiye, ariko birashoboka
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
Why did you do that?	Kuki wabikoze?
You can stop being my teacher.	Urashobora kureka kuba umwarimu wanjye.
One was a woman.	Umwe yari umugore.
I'm not sure what to do	Sinzi neza icyo gukora
And close.	Kandi hafi.
Eventually, it worked out well for me.	Amaherezo, byagenze neza kuri njye.
It's small.	Ni muto.
I didn’t think he had said anything before	Sinatekerezaga ko hari ibyo yavuze mbere
I have a lot of money	Mfite amafaranga menshi
I didn’t even want to do this	Sinigeze nshaka no gukora ibi
But he must.	Ariko agomba.
And in fact, he had no plans of his own.	Kandi mubyukuri, ntabwo yari afite gahunda wenyine.
I think it will.	Ntekereza ko bizaba.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I'm really glad you're here to help.	Nishimiye rwose ko uri hano gufasha.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
In fact, it is possible.	Mubyukuri, birashoboka.
I was scared	Nagize ubwoba
This one would work.	Uyu yari gukora.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
I think maybe it's possible	Ntekereza ko ahari bishoboka
I see nothing in it.	Ntacyo mbona muri cyo.
You want to do it.	Urashaka kubikora.
It was not a very good thing.	Ntabwo byari ibintu byiza cyane.
It's all.	Ni byose.
He was leaving.	Yari agenda.
I have to wait now	Ngomba gutegereza ubu
He had many friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But something went wrong.	Ariko hari aho ibintu byagenze nabi.
I mean from there.	Ndashaka kuvuga kuva aho.
I heard nothing, I saw nothing, I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise, ntacyo mbona, ntacyo numvise
I don't want to talk to you.	Ntashaka kuvugana nawe.
I want to talk to myself	Ndashaka kuvugana wenyine
Or.	Cyangwa.
You want to study, well.	Ushaka kwiga, neza.
And I don’t know how to do it.	Kandi sinzi uburyo bwo gukora.
For a short time no one commented.	Mu gihe gito nta muntu wigeze agira icyo avuga.
I really needed to	Nari nkeneye rwose
I believe it is a mistake	Nizera ko ari amakosa
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
You and I, now.	Ni wowe na njye, ubu.
I think that's a good thing	Ndakeka ko aricyo kintu cyiza
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
There is so much to see here.	Hano hari byinshi byo kubona.
And that is me.	Kandi uwo ni njye.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
Down, down, down.	Hasi, Hasi, Hasi.
Large and small.	Kinini na gito.
I really like this one	Nkunda cyane iyi
You have nothing to do with this.	Ntacyo ukora kuri ibi.
I should not have worried	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugira impungenge
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
I know you can do this	Nzi ko ushobora gukora ibi
Just his opinion.	Igitekerezo cye gusa.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
I think he was young	Ntekereza ko yari akiri muto
I was lucky in that.	Nagize amahirwe muri ibyo.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
I really like what happened.	Nkunda cyane uko byagenze.
I like to read things.	Nkunda gusoma ibintu.
I wonder why that is, right now.	Ndabaza impamvu ibyo aribyo, ubu.
I can't say anything else about that	Sinshobora kuvuga ikindi kintu kuri ibyo
I have no gifts	Ntabwo mfite impano
The interior was beautiful	Imbere byari byiza
I just didn't know how to do it	Gusa sinari nzi uko azabikora
I didn't mean to offend you	Sinari nashakaga kuvuga byinshi
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo cyiza.
But enough for me.	Ariko bihagije kuri njye.
I want to know what happened	Ndashaka kumenya uko byagenze
I have problems here	Mfite ibibazo hano
It's not you.	Ntabwo ari nawe.
I hope this is good enough.	Nizere ko ibi ari byiza bihagije.
That's good enough for me.	Nibyiza bihagije kuri njye.
I was just smart really	Nari ubwenge gusa mubyukuri mubyukuri
He was a young man with a lot of ideas for him.	Yari umuntu muto ufite igitekerezo kinini kuri we.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I can't go back.	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma.
I think the time is right	Ntekereza ko igihe ari cyiza
However, this was not true.	Ariko, mubyukuri ntabwo byari ukuri.
I may be working tonight	Nshobora kuba nkora iri joro
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
No one said anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze avuga ikintu.
I hear your son is a boy	Ndumva umuntu wawe umuhungu
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
Good thing, truth	Ikintu cyiza, ukuri
That was too much for us.	Ibyo byari byinshi cyane kuri twe.
He hadn't looked back.	Ntabwo yari yarebye inyuma.
In fact, you can.	Mubyukuri, urashobora.
I want to see something soon.	Ndashaka kubona ikintu vuba aha.
Out of school	Kuva ku ishuri.
You can have my money.	Urashobora kugira amafaranga yanjye.
I didn’t know any of that would happen	Sinari nzi ko hari kimwe muri ibyo byari kubaho
I can't get a chance tomorrow	Ntabwo nshobora kubona amahirwe ejo
Something you saw.	Hari icyo wabonye.
I want to do this	Ndashaka gukora ibi
Definitely a book inside.	Rwose igitabo imbere.
I need something else	Nkeneye ikindi kintu
That was easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye.
Is that possible? 	Ibyo birashoboka?
I should know tomorrow	Nkwiye kumenya ejo
I want it to look like tomorrow	Ndashaka ko asa nkaho ejo
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
He saw a little.	Yabonye gato.
He's going to try.	Agiye kugerageza.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I can do it	Nshobora kubikora
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
School is another issue.	Ishuri ni ikindi kibazo.
And he never did.	Kandi ntiyigeze abikora.
He loved it.	Yakundaga.
I didn't know that	Sinari nzi ibyo
I enjoyed this question.	Nishimiye iki kibazo.
I can't do this	Sinshobora gukora ibi
I can't say he didn't	Sinshobora kuvuga ko na we atabikoze
I know it's not your fault	Nzi ko atari amakosa yawe
He said he wanted to talk.	Yavuze ko ashaka kuvuga.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
To be honest.	Kugira ukuri.
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
I just need to hear.	Nkeneye kumva gusa.
You don’t have to be scared.	Ntugomba kugira ubwoba.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I just hope not too many	Gusa nizere ko atari benshi cyane
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni impamvu nziza.
He needed time.	Yari akeneye igihe.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He is close to school alone.	Ari hafi mu ishuri wenyine.
Same as usual.	Kimwe nkuko byari bisanzwe.
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
But now this is a bad thing.	Ariko ubu ni ikintu kibi.
But that is exactly what happened.	Ariko uko ni ko byagenze.
It's not my money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga yanjye.
I don't think so	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo
I didn't think so	Ntabwo natekerezaga
I had the same problem.	Nagize ikibazo kimwe.
I know what you need	Nzi icyo ukeneye
I want to go	Ndashaka kujyana
I can't believe it's true	Sinshobora kwizera ko ari ukuri
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
But not that day.	Ariko si uwo munsi.
He tried to think of something to say.	Yagerageje gutekereza ku kintu cyo kuvuga.
And that's exactly what you have to do.	Kandi nibyo ugomba gukora.
I can hear nothing	Ntacyo nshobora kumva
I got it right	Nabonye neza neza
I knew he knew a lot.	Nari nzi ko yari azi byinshi.
You got a job.	Wabonye akazi.
I believe that is not true	Ndizera ko ibyo atari ukuri
All right, good.	Byose, byiza.
He really has to go now.	Agomba rwose kugenda ubu.
It is not a problem now but it will be in time.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo ubu ariko bizaba mugihe.
I didn't know what he meant	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
That really was it.	Ibyo rwose byari.
I can't go back	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma
I know it's good for me	Nzi ko ari byiza kuri njye
I think he knows the guy	Ntekereza ko azi umusore
I just thought it would be nice to have one.	Gusa natekereje ko byaba byiza kubaho kuri umwe.
He asked for the idea of ​​learning.	Yasabye igitekerezo cyo kwiga.
I knew nothing	Nta na kimwe nari nzi
He hadn't been in years.	Ntabwo yari amaze imyaka.
That's right.	Nibyo.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
I wanted a family.	Nashakaga umuryango.
You have money in front of you.	Ufite amafaranga imbere yawe.
But it is good.	Ariko ni mwiza.
I want to see what she is wearing	Ndashaka kureba icyo yambaye
That is very high.	Ibyo ni hejuru cyane.
He didn't want to think about anything else.	Ntiyashakaga gutekereza ikindi.
I think he needs his time	Ntekereza ko akeneye igihe cye
I can't stay here	Sinshobora kuguma hano
! 	!
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He's gone now.	Yagiye ubu.
I am a good player.	Ndi umukinnyi mwiza.
Only.	Gusa.
I don’t have to have it now	Ntabwo ngomba kugira ubu
I knew what he was feeling	Nari nzi icyo yumva
You also need opportunities.	Ukeneye kandi amahirwe.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
He went after eating.	Yagiye amaze kurya.
I knew nothing about this	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi kuri ibi
He was not a real person, either.	Ntabwo yari umuntu rwose, neza.
I knew there was no going back	Nari nzi ko nta gusubira inyuma
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
Or while eating.	Cyangwa mugihe cyo kurya.
He had come to this.	Yari yaje kuri ibi.
That was the plan.	Iyo yari gahunda.
There is no going back now.	Nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
I can think clearly	Nshobora gutekereza neza
I hope he does.	Ndizera ko azabikora.
To be bad	Kuba mubi.
I shouldn't have done that	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora gutya
I'm happy to eat something	Nishimiye kurya ikintu
And you did the same.	Kandi nawe wabikoze.
I shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I didn't want to go to school	Sinifuzaga kujya ku ishuri
I saw this	Nabonye ibi
You need to know.	Ugomba kumenya.
He had to work.	Yagombaga gukora.
This, however, is not the case.	Ibi ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
And that was absolutely wrong.	Kandi ibyo byari amakosa rwose.
I'm scared to go home	Mfite ubwoba bwo gutaha
By this time, he was completely gone.	Iki gihe, yari yagiye rwose.
But he will do it later.	Ariko azabikora nyuma.
At that point I had to go.	Icyo gihe nari nkwiye kugenda.
I didn’t think he was scared	Sinatekerezaga ko yagize ubwoba
One with him.	Umwe hamwe na we.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I would know if he has	Nari kumenya niba afite
I can't figure out who he is	Sinshobora kumenya uwo ari we
Someone said something.	Umuntu yagize icyo avuga.
I can't take everything	Sinshobora gufata byose
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Right now,.	Kuri ubu,.
I am her hair.	Ndi umusatsi we.
That's right.	Nibyo.
We have a job.	Dufite akazi.
I was a bad girl	Nari umukobwa mubi
I was really scared	Nari mfite ubwoba rwose
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
I am a very easygoing girl	Ndi umuhanga cyane byoroshye kugenda umukobwa
I wouldn't do anything else	Ntabwo nari gukora ikindi kintu
I wish it all to me this morning	Ndashaka ko byose kuri njye muri iki gitondo
The first thing he would do.	Ikintu cya mbere yari gukora.
But you.	Ariko wowe.
One day, he was gone.	Umunsi umwe, yari yagiye.
He thought it was good enough.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza bihagije.
I hope it was, really	Ndizera ko byari, kuri
I like to know where you are.	Nkunda kumenya aho uri.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.

I didn't need help	Sinari nkeneye ubufasha
Only his luck.	Amahirwe ye gusa.
If not him.	Niba atari we.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
And he was looking bad.	Kandi yashakaga nabi.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe.
I thought that was a good thing	Natekereje ko ibyo byagenze neza
But it is not in him.	Ariko ntabwo ari muri we.
He didn't know it existed.	Ntiyari azi ko ahari.
I have not heard or seen anything	Ntacyo numvise cyangwa mbona
We have everything we need inside.	Dufite ibyo dukeneye byose imbere.
I need to watch that movie	Nkeneye kureba iyo firime
You did that before.	Ibyo wabikoze mbere.
I was not sure of this	Sinari nzi neza ibi
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
I should have gone earlier	Nari nkwiye kugenda kare
As if he never lived.	Nkaho atigeze aba.
In fact it is true.	Mubyukuri ni ukuri.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
He was a kid, really.	Yari umwana, rwose.
I'm sure you're on top of me	Nzi neza ko uri hejuru yanjye
I didn't know what it was	Nanjye sinari nzi icyo aricyo
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
I have to take one today	Ngomba gufata uyu munsi umwe umwe
But that is not always the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo gufata igihe cyose.
It was a catch.	Byari umuntu gufata.
It looks good.	Asa naho ari mwiza.
I never thought this was possible	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza ko ibi bishoboka
Sunday was a good day.	Ku cyumweru wari mwiza.
I never liked that	Sinigeze nkunda ibyo
I can't drink at that time	Ntabwo nshobora kunywa icyo gihe
He was there earlier, that morning.	Yari ahari mbere, muri icyo gitondo.
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
Everyone wants something.	Umuntu wese arashaka ikintu.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.

This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
I hope it's good with you.	Nizere ko ari byiza nawe.

I thought we needed to play a lot first.	Natekereje ko dukeneye gukina byinshi mbere.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari amakosa.
He could have done something.	Yashoboraga kugira icyo akora.
It's not you, it's him.	Ntabwo ari wowe, cyangwa kuri we.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
I thought this was a good idea.	Natekereje ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I really deserve to see someone	Nkwiye rwose kubona umuntu
I hope he does	Ndizera ko azabikora
I think you would be nice	Ndatekereza ko waba mwiza
Where he was supposed to be.	Aho yagombaga kuba.
I have to be inside	Ngomba kuba imbere
We are close.	Turi hafi.

Absolutely the same thing.	Ikintu kimwe rwose.

That's fine with us !.	Nibyiza natwe!.
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly	Birashoboka ko bafite ukuri
I thought it was too much	Natekereje ko ari byinshi cyane
He knew exactly what.	Ibyo yari azi neza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
None of us knew what to do.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari uzi icyo gukora.
I'm going to do it.	Ngiye kubikora.
He could be anyone.	Yashoboraga kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I didn't know what to do and I felt ashamed	Sinari nzi icyo gukora kandi numvise mfite isoni
I can't do anything wrong	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ikintu kibi
He told me.	Yambwiye.
It seemed easy.	Yasaga naho byoroshye.
I didn't want to see anyone	Sinifuzaga kubona umuntu uwo ari we wese
All we need is you.	Ibyo dukeneye gusa.
I love a guy, but he.	Nkunda umusore, ariko we.
I don’t think there’s any of that.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko hari kimwe muri ibyo.
And he had been for a long time.	Kandi yari amaze igihe kinini.
They were people in front of you.	Bari abantu imbere yawe.
You are alone.	Uri wenyine.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I guess he likes this	Ndakeka ko akunda ibi
I can't live like that.	Sinshobora kubaho gutya.
I'm not at home.	Ntabwo ndi murugo.
That's all.	Ibyo ni byose.
I think that's all you can say	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo byose ushobora kuvuga
That's great.	Ibyo ni byiza cyane.
I never liked this either.	Nanjye sinigeze nkunda ibi.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
I thought he looked good	Natekereje ko asa neza
I can't understand why	Sinshobora kumva impamvu
I am a teacher	Ndi umwarimu
I didn't want to go again	Sinifuzaga kongera kugenda
Eat well and read his book.	Kurya neza no gusoma igitabo cye.
He was very lucky.	Yari afite amahirwe menshi.
That's not what you think.	Ntabwo aribyo utekereza.
This is not always true.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari ukuri.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I never thought of this	Sinigeze ntekereza ibi
We are both.	Ni bombi.
I need to hear him walk in me	Nkeneye kumva agenda muri njye
That's what you do.	Nibyo ukora.
No one had.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite.
At times, he even had a friend.	Rimwe na rimwe, yari afite inshuti ye.
In that he was right.	Muri ibyo yari afite ukuri.
I felt bad.	Numvise nabi.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari kuri we.
Most of us.	Benshi muri twe.
All in all, this is a great phone.	Muri byose, iyi ni terefone nziza cyane.
I was very worried.	Nagize impungenge cyane.
I knew nothing.	Ntacyo nari nzi.
I was like that.	Nari uko.
I don't know much.	Sinzi byinshi.
I should have everything on schedule	Nkwiye kugira byose kuri gahunda
I mean, he's a really good guy	Ndashaka kuvuga, ni umusore mwiza rwose
But in reality, it is not.	Ariko mubyukuri, ntabwo.
In my house it is not below.	Mu nzu yanjye ntabwo ari munsi.
I tend to be bad at times, whatever that is	Nkunda kuba mubi rimwe na rimwe, ibyo aribyo byose
I didn’t want to see that possible	Sinifuzaga kubona ko bishoboka
I needed to talk to someone	Nari nkeneye kuvugana numuntu
Eating is a big deal.	Kurya ni ikibazo cyane.
It’s not always easy to be close	Ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye kuba hafi
But he was not alone.	Ariko ntabwo yari we wenyine.
I think of all that	Ntekereza kuri ibyo byose
Or is it a girl ?.	Cyangwa ni umukobwa?.
For a very small thing.	Kuri ikintu gito cyane.
I think you are my son	Ndatekereza ko uri umuhungu wanjye
Whatever you want.	Ibyo ushaka byose.
I know everything	Nzi byose
I think it's a great movie	Ntekereza ko ari firime nziza cyane
It was not.	Ntabwo byari ibi.
I only have one problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe gusa
Things when.	Ibintu iyo.
Excellent study	Kwiga neza cyane
I think that's true, but maybe sometimes it's not	Ntekereza ko ari ukuri, ariko birashoboka ko rimwe na rimwe atari byo
Very good, possible.	Nibyiza cyane, birashoboka.
I needed to get out of that room	Nari nkeneye kuva muri icyo cyumba
I want to do it here	Ndashaka kubikora hano
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
I am here all the time.	Ndi hano igihe cyose.
I knew what it was	Nari nzi icyo aricyo
He was not going to talk to anyone.	Ntabwo yari agiye kuvugana n'umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari kubikora.
I'm upstairs.	Ndi hejuru.
I wanted to get out of this prison	Nashakaga kuva muri iyi gereza
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
He did not go far.	Ntabwo yagiye kure.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
I love when there is so much to do	Nkunda iyo hari byinshi byo gukora
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
I want to leave this world	Ndashaka kuva kuri iyi si
I love being here	Nkunda cyane kuba hano
I know there is a little girl.	Nzi ko hari umukobwa muto.
I understand why he did what he did	Ndumva impamvu yakoze ibyo yakoze
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
I want to hear it again	Ndashaka kongera kumva bisanzwe
As he was near.	Nkuko yari hafi.
I understand the problems	Ndumva ibibazo
You are doing well.	Urimo ukora neza.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
I saw that he was not alone	Nabonye atari wenyine
Later, he admitted that he had done the same.	Nyuma, yemeye ko na we yabikoze.
Yes, he knows it all.	Nibyo, azi byose.
I never thought of being alone	Sinigeze ntekereza kuba wenyine
I would eat well.	Nari kurya neza.
I think we can take it	Ndatekereza ko dushobora gufata
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I feel he is doing well	Ndumva akora neza
Or nothing more.	Cyangwa nta kintu kinini.
I mean, he just had it	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yari afite gusa
He thought it was easy.	Yatekereje ko byoroshye.
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga ikintu na kimwe
I was really.	Nari rwose.
I can't even get a car out of here	Sinshobora no kubona imodoka kuva hano
You are doing something.	Urimo ukora ikintu.
I was not sure if there was one of them	Ntabwo nari nzi neza niba hari kimwe muri byo
I should have been home	Nari nkwiye kuba murugo
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekereje cyane
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
I would study.	Nari kwiga.
He saw that coming.	Yabonye ko kuza.
I did not know what had happened	Ntabwo nari nzi uko byagenze
Or anything else here.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose hano.
I never wanted to drink it before	Sinigeze nshaka no kunywa mbere na mbere
He was just a young man.	Yari umusore gusa.
I have a plan with him this week	Mfite gahunda na we muri iki cyumweru
The child was ready.	Umwana yari yiteguye.
I want to be really good and you have to be.	Ndashaka kuba mwiza rwose kandi nawe ugomba kubikora.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
It's very possible, too	Nanjye birashoboka cyane, nanjye
I didn't know what else to do	Sinari nzi ikindi gukora
I still don't know what happened.	Kugeza ubu sinzi uko byagenze.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
I'm not doing anything	Ntacyo ndimo gukora
Either way, we have to go.	Ibyo ari byo byose, tugomba kugenda.
I wanted to talk to you a little bit	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe gato
He did not say much about the possibility.	Ntiyigeze avuga byinshi kuri ibyo bishoboka.
I did it for the first time	Nakoze bwa mbere
He would not go.	Ntiyari kugenda.
He didn't want to go with me.	Ntiyashakaga kujyana nanjye.
I'm scared too	Nanjye mfite ubwoba
I know a lot of people.	Nzi abantu benshi.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I have a lot of things	Ndi ibintu byinshi
It was great to see.	Byari byiza cyane kubona.
I thought about that for a while	Natekereje kuri ibyo igihe gito
Lots of gifts, that	Impano nyinshi, iyo
It doesn't even have to be there.	Ntagomba no kuba ahari.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
Anyone can tell everyone good things.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubwira umuntu wese ibintu byiza.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
I really understand.	Nukuri ndumva.
I'm not here	Ntabwo ndi hano
I thought he might be right	Natekerezaga ko ashobora kuba afite ukuri
He probably had no reason to be.	Birashoboka ko nta mpamvu yari afite yo kuba.
That's why he doesn't know much about her.	Ni yo mpamvu atazi neza muri we.
My friend is here.	Inshuti yanjye hano.
One by one.	Umwe umwe.
I'm very worried.	Mfite impungenge nyinshi.
It wouldn't help.	Ntabwo byari gufasha.
He would have more time to do this.	Yaba afite igihe kinini cyo gukora ibi.
I am doing well so far.	Nkora neza kugeza ubu.
And this.	Kandi ibi.
The little boy asked for money	Umuhungu muto yasabye amafaranga
None of us can say.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ushobora kuvuga.
People are people.	Abantu ni abantu.
I had many.	Nari mfite benshi.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
I can't figure out why	Sinshobora kumenya impamvu
He was out.	Yari hanze.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
I knew what it was	Nari nzi icyo aricyo
I heard it was there.	Numvise ko ahari.
If you want to go, you can go.	Niba ushaka kugenda, urashobora kugenda.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
All day, every day.	Umunsi wose, buri munsi.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko atari byiza.
I can't say how or when	Sinshobora kuvuga uburyo cyangwa igihe
I'm sure he had one too.	Nzi neza ko na we yari afite.
You said nothing.	Ntacyo wavuze.
I mean, you can go	Ndashaka kuvuga, urashobora kugenda
You are now old.	Ubu ufite imyaka.
He didn't know how to look.	Ntabwo yari azi kureba.
Before eating	Mbere yo kurya ibiryo.
You can.	Urashobora.
You can be alone.	Urashobora kuba wenyine.
He is alone.	We wenyine.
That’s a great idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo kinini.
He didn't know what to say to anyone.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo yashakaga kubwira umuntu.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
I do things the way they do	Nkora ibintu nkuko abikora
But especially for him.	Ariko cyane cyane kuri we.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I never heard what he said	Sinigeze numva ibyo yavuze
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
I had many friends	Nari mfite inshuti nyinshi
I know what you think.	Nzi icyo utekereza.
I think it's easy	Ntekereza ko byoroshye
They have a lot to see.	Bafite byinshi byo kubona.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I don't need much	Ntabwo nkeneye byinshi
I didn't think of tomorrow or tomorrow	Ntabwo natekereje ejo cyangwa ejo
I mean, he really liked school	Ndashaka kuvuga ko yakundaga ishuri rwose
He was here, but now he was not.	Yari hano, ariko ubu ntabwo yari.
Going well.	Kugenda neza.
I never did that	Ntabwo nigeze nkora ibyo
Yes, he is my friend.	Nibyo, ni inshuti yanjye.
Not everyone had a problem.	Ntabwo abantu bose bari bafite ikibazo.
I just know what it is	Nzi gusa icyo aricyo
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
'	'
He loved what he saw.	Yakundaga ibyo yabonye.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
Only for us.	Kuri twe gusa.
I wanted to take something	Nashakaga gufata ikintu
I didn't know what he meant.	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I had nothing good to do	Nta kintu cyiza nari mfite cyo gukora
I had a very bad day	Nagize umunsi mubi cyane
I want him to think	Ndashaka ko atekereza
I have something everyone wants.	Mfite ikintu buri wese ashaka.
They had a lot of money, which was true.	Bafite amafaranga menshi, byari ukuri.
I think all day long	Ntekereza umunsi wose
He was not alone.	Ntabwo rwose yari ahari wenyine.
I knew it was true	Nari nzi ko mubyukuri
They have the same problem with doing that.	Bafite ikibazo kimwe cyo gukora ibyo.
The most beautiful girl was, too	Umukobwa mwiza cyane yari, nawe
I can't see what to do.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ibyo gukora.
I was just scared	Nagize ubwoba gusa
I was going yesterday	Nari ngiye ejo
Or something else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu.
He had time to do it.	Yari afite umwanya wo kubikora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He probably had a problem here.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ikibazo hano.
I was down, really down.	Nari hasi, rwose ndi hasi.
I am the only one now.	Ubu ni njye gusa.
Together it's good.	Hamwe nibyiza.
Away from him	Kure ye.
I know a lot of things	Nzi ibintu byinshi
I knew it well enough	Nari nzi neza bihagije
He left early this morning.	Yagiye kare muri iki gitondo.
He wants to leave this house.	Ashaka kuva muri iyi nzu.
If you know what you're looking for, that's fine.	Niba uzi icyo urimo gushaka, nibyiza.
I want to be here	Ndashaka kuba hano
I really want to go home	Ndashaka rwose gutaha
But he was old.	Ariko yari afite imyaka.
He wanted to go home.	Yashakaga gutaha.
He will never and never will.	Ntazigera agira kandi ntazigera abikora.
I can do it easily	Nshobora kubikora byoroshye
Bad idea.	Igitekerezo kibi.
But she wants a baby.	Ariko arashaka umwana.
First of all.	Kuri mbere.
He thought it was great.	Yatekereje ko byari byiza cyane.
Today I have to drive his car	Uyu munsi ngomba gutwara imodoka ye
I don't really want to	Sinshaka rwose
I need to know now	Nkeneye kumenya nonaha
I don't think so.	Ntabwo mbona ko aribyo.
And just living with me.	Kandi kubana gusa nanjye.
Good gift.	Impano nziza.
I wanted to read more	Nashakaga gusoma byinshi
Existence is something else.	Kubaho ni ikindi kintu.
One could only believe, and wait.	Umuntu yashoboraga kwizera gusa, no gutegereza.
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza kuri ibyo.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
I like the way he thinks	Nishimiye uburyo atekereza
I had another problem	Nagize ikindi kibazo
He was looking for something.	Yashakaga ikintu.
In this, later.	Muri ibi, nyuma.
In.	Muri.
If you like it very much.	Niba ukunda cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane ko atari byo.
I was going to jail.	Nari ngiye muri gereza.
I love living with you	Nkunda cyane kubana nawe
He knows what to do.	Azi icyo gukora.
It's really good.	Mubyukuri nibyiza.
That's not the problem right now.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo ubu.
But this is great.	Ariko ibi nibyiza cyane.
I shouldn't have gone that far	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugenda gutya
I think from here	Ndatekereza kuva hano
You know he will do it.	Uzi ko azabikora.
Time to think.	Umwanya wo gutekereza.
But one more thing.	Ariko kimwe kimwe kandi.
I knew what he was going to say	Nari nzi icyo agiye kuvuga
Thank you so much for what we have here	Nakoze cyane kubyo dufite hano
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko umuntu yahisemo akazi atari ko.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu ni byiza cyane.
I know it's not easy	Nzi ko atari ibintu byoroshye
Ninde.	Ninde.
I just want your money	Ndashaka amafaranga yawe gusa
But here.	Ariko hano.
It's actually worse than it looks.	Nukuri rwose ni mubi cyane kuruta uko asa.
The car is great.	Imodoka ni nziza.
I had enough problems.	Nagize ibibazo bihagije.
And he thinks that's a good thing.	Kandi atekereza ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
If so.	Niba niba.
I thought he was doing it	Natekerezaga ko abikora
I know that's what he wants me to do	Nzi ko aribyo ashaka ko nkora
That's what he should have done from the beginning.	Nibyo yari akwiye gukora kuva mbere.
He didn't want to read.	Ntiyashakaga gusoma.
But we must be aware of this.	Ariko tugomba kumenya neza.
I can't take anything else	Sinshobora gufata ikindi kintu
I never loved anyone or anything	Ntabwo nigeze nkunda umuntu cyangwa ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
I can't read one of them properly	Ntabwo nshobora gusoma kimwe muri byo neza
He was well aware of the opportunity.	Yari azi neza amahirwe.
Everyone.	Abantu bose.
This is it.	Iyi ni.
It looks like.	Birasa nkaho.
Eat.	Kurya.
I did not know at all	Sinari nzi na gato
I don't know what to do	Sinzi icyo gukora
That's all.	Gusa icyo aricyo.
I would be too	Nanjye nari kuba
Maybe I was lucky enough to see that	Birashoboka ko nagize amahirwe yo kubona ibyo
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I don't see any positives	Ntabwo mbona ibintu byiza
You have your child.	Ufite umwana wawe.
It was not good.	Ntabwo yari mwiza.
Lots.	Byinshi.
You can't think of anything better.	Ntushobora gutekereza ikindi kintu cyiza.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
I knew it all	Nari nzi ko byose
I can't tell you what to do	Sinshobora kubwira icyo gukora
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
I need to be clear	Nkeneye kuvuga neza
Not normal.	Ntabwo bisanzwe.
I, however, am glad that he is not here today.	Njye ariko, nishimiye ko atari hano muri iki gihe.
There is a girl.	Hariho umukobwa.
I think he was worried about me	Ntekereza ko yari afite impungenge kuri njye
Smart people.	Abantu bafite ubwenge.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari amakosa.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
You said she wanted a baby.	Wavuze ko yavuze ko ashaka umwana.
That's exactly what he wanted to do.	Nibyo rwose nibyo yashakaga gukora.
It would be easy to give up.	Byaba byoroshye kureka.
I was not sure what	Sinari nzi neza icyo
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
Each of them.	Buri kimwe muri byo.
He enjoyed that.	Yishimiye ibyo.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
I have everything today.	Mfite ibintu byose uyu munsi.
That's great.	Ni byiza cyane.
I am very good at this	Ndi mwiza cyane kuri ibi
I saw a party.	Nabonye ibirori.
You have a lot to do.	Ufite byinshi byo gukora.
But sometimes.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe.
You don’t have to wait long.	Ntugomba gutegereza igihe kirekire.
Someone has to take it.	Umuntu ugomba gufata.
Or, not really.	Cyangwa, ntabwo mubyukuri.
I can do that.	Nshobora gukora ibyo.
And it's not very close.	Kandi ntabwo iri hafi cyane.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Byose, ibyo aribyo byose.
Just once.	Rimwe gusa.
I wouldn't do it then	Ntabwo nari kubikora icyo gihe
I enjoyed the opportunity to play every day.	Nishimiye amahirwe yo gukina buri munsi.
I didn’t want to give up	Sinifuzaga kureka
He saw his son.	Yabonye umuhungu we.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That really doesn't matter.	Ibyo rwose ntacyo.
I'm sure it will.	Nzi neza ko bizaba.
I'm scared of everything	Mfite ubwoba kuri byose
I'm just one person.	Ndi umuntu umwe gusa.
I knew drinking was a bad idea	Nari nzi ko kunywa ari igitekerezo kibi
All right now.	Byose ubu.
I mean, until.	Ndashaka kuvuga, kugeza.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I have enough problems	Mfite ibibazo bihagije
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
I like to do it easily	Nkunda kubikora byoroshye
Learning.	Kwiga.
This will not be easy to say.	Ibi ntabwo bizaba byoroshye kuvuga.
It's too bad, too bad.	Ni mubi, cyane, mubi cyane.
It is very likely that this person will be better and better.	Birashoboka cyane ko uyu muntu azaba mwiza kandi mwiza.
I think that's enough for now	Ntekereza ko ibyo bihagije kuri ubu
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
His father was also present.	Se na we yari ahari.
I was very close.	Nari hafi cyane.
Something to watch.	Ikintu cyo kureba.
I don't want this movie.	Sinshaka iyi firime.
At the time, we didn’t have one.	Icyo gihe, ntabwo twari dufite.
I was not sure	Ntabwo nari nzi neza
I have to get out of here.	Ngomba kuva hano.
He looked very young.	Hafi ye yasaga naho ari muto.
It was great for that.	Byari byiza cyane kubyo.
However, it is true.	Ariko, ni ukuri.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje kuri icyo kibazo.
I didn't know what he was thinking	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo yatekerezaga
He did not know exactly what that was.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo.
No one knew where he was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho yari ari.
I just know he thought about it	Gusa nzi ko yatekereje igitekerezo
I don’t know, we just have to see.	Sinzi, tugomba kubona gusa.
I didn't know how to do it	Sinari nzi kubikora
You think so much of it is possible.	Uratekereza cyane birashoboka.
I'm not good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza.
I was embarrassed.	Nagize isoni.
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
That's not what he wanted to hear.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga kumva.
He thought maybe this was true.	Yatekereje ko ahari ibi ari ukuri.
I wanted to see everything	Nashakaga kubona byose
I just want to help people	Ndashaka gufasha abantu gusa
I don't want to know then.	Ntashaka kumenya icyo gihe.
He looked.	Yarebye.
But you are an expert.	Ariko uri umuhanga.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Only he never did.	Gusa ntabwo yigeze abikora.
He had it all day in front of him.	Yari afite umunsi wose imbere ye.
Women.	Akazi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He didn't want me to see him.	Ntiyashakaga ko mbona.
I told my friend, here	Nabwiye inshuti yanjye, hano
I was never scared	Sinigeze numva ubwoba
I think we have something here	Ndatekereza ko hari ikintu dufite hano
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
No one knew who was coming to him.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi kuza kuri we.
In us.	Muri twe.
I was not a good person	Ntabwo nari umuntu mwiza
I have it all.	Mfite byose.
But my wife.	Ariko umugore wanjye.
I wouldn't be	Ntabwo nari kuba
It's so beautiful, for everyone.	Ni mwiza cyane, kuri bose.
I didn't have much to say	Ntabwo nari mfite byinshi byo kuvuga
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
I want to ask for help	Ndashaka gusaba ubufasha
Or are you going to do your hair.	Cyangwa ugiye gukora umusatsi wawe.
He thought he had something to say, but I didn't know what to say.	Yatekereje ko agomba kugira icyo avuga, ariko ntazi icyo.
It is now.	Ubu ni.
I had nothing.	Nta na kimwe nari mfite.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, ibyo birasa nabi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
It was easy to catch.	Byari byoroshye gufata.
He said you could tell the truth.	Yavuze ko ushobora kuvuga ukuri.
And she is well dressed.	Kandi yambaye neza.
I can wait a while	Nshobora gutegereza igihe gito
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I mean, he's not like her	Ndashaka kuvuga ko atari nka we
It would be great.	Byari kuba byiza cyane.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
I think that was absolutely true.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari ukuri rwose.
He did exactly what he was supposed to do	Yakoze neza ibyo yagombaga gukora
He is not as young as he used to be.	Ntabwo akiri muto nkuko byari bisanzwe.
But now.	Ariko ubu.
I have to be very far from now	Ngomba kuba ndi kure cyane kugeza ubu
He began to retreat.	Yatangiye gusubira inyuma.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
To try	Kugerageza.
Maybe everything was wrong.	Ahari ibintu byose byari amakosa.
Anything to do.	Ikintu cyose cyo gukora.
I saw it for the first time.	Nabonye bwa mbere neza.
I should have been the one to go	Nari nkwiye kuba uwo kugenda
And very high.	Kandi hejuru cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I got it really well	Nabonye neza rwose
I didn’t know what I was thinking before	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza mbere
I just hope he is still here	Gusa nizere ko akiri hano
I want more than anything else.	Ndashaka kuruta ikindi kintu cyose.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba byiza.
This was difficult for me.	Ibi byari bigoye kuri njye.
At the same time.	Mugihe kimwe.
At the time, he never heard of his friend.	Icyo gihe ntiyigeze yumva inshuti ye.
He didn't want to know anything.	Ntiyashakaga kumenya ikintu na kimwe.
We have time for more.	Dufite umwanya kuri byinshi.
To him.	Kugeza kuri we.
I can't even be your friend now	Ubu sinshobora no kuba inshuti yawe
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's right- this is not about him.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo yari yizeye.
Alone, it wasn’t too much.	We wenyine, ntabwo yari menshi cyane.
I wanted to know more about him	Nashakaga kumenya byinshi kuri we
Maybe you can do it.	Birashoboka ko ushobora kubikora.
He tried to do well.	Yagerageje gukora neza.
I hope you enjoy reading.	Nizere ko ukunda gusoma.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I don't know what to do with this.	Sinzi icyo gukora muri ibi.
I need to eat something	Nkeneye kurya ikintu
We can't do this.	Ibi ntidushobora kubikora.
I wonder what he wants me to do today	Ndabaza icyo ashaka ko nkora uyu munsi
That's right.	Nibyo.
But that is not the case.	Ariko si byo.
I know your time.	Nzi umwanya wawe.
You are really good.	Mubyukuri uri mwiza.
I can live with that	Nshobora kubana nibyo
And this is very possible.	Kandi ibi birashoboka cyane.
I'm really scared.	Mfite ubwoba rwose.
I know nothing, I have done nothing	Ntacyo nzi, ntacyo nakoze
One must have.	Umuntu agomba kugira.
Same thing with learning.	Ikintu kimwe no kwiga.
He wants to play bad.	Ashaka gukina nabi.
Only good things.	Ibintu byiza gusa.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
I can't figure out anything	Sinshobora kumenya icyo aricyo cyose
Same thing with me.	Ikintu kimwe nanjye.
I don't want anyone to be their father.	Sinshaka ko umuntu aba se.
It went wrong.	Byagenze nabi.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
I didn't know all that	Sinari nzi ibyo byose
It was as if they knew a lot.	Byari nkaho bari bazi byinshi.
My wife was at school or something.	Umugore wanjye yari ku ishuri cyangwa ikindi kintu.
I thought he might be her	Natekereje ko ashobora kuba ari we
We all have it all right.	Twese dufite byose neza.
No one wanted to be here.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze yifuza kuba hano.
Do you think this would be easy?	Uratekereza ko ibi byaba byoroshye.
There is time here.	Hano hari umwanya.
No work today.	Nta kazi uyu munsi.
I like to think that is it	Nkunda gutekereza ko aribyo
He had no house.	Nta nzu yari afite.
I wonder if he knows how good he is	Ndabaza niba azi uko ari mwiza
One thing we all need to do.	Ikintu kimwe twese tugomba gukora.
He wanted to stay.	Yashakaga kuguma.
I was scared, if you want to know the truth	Nagize ubwoba, niba ushaka kumenya ukuri
I have a gift for everyone	Mfite impano kuri buri wese
I want to do things	Ndashaka gukora ibintu
Only the house was gone, and it was completely gone.	Gusa inzu yari yagiye, kandi yari yagiye rwose.
I was early.	Nari kare.
He had not chosen.	Ntabwo yari yahisemo.
He wanted out.	Yashakaga hanze.
Or maybe this was my fault.	Cyangwa ahari ibi byari amakosa yanjye.
He had already tried the door.	Yari amaze kugerageza umuryango.
Best friend	Inshuti nziza cyane.
He worked for a long time.	Yakoze igihe kirekire.
I was going to do this	Nari ngiye gukora ibi
I want to be human again.	Ndashaka kongera kuba umuntu.
I can't come today.	Sinshobora kuza uyu munsi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I just didn’t think he felt the same way	Gusa sinigeze ntekereza ko nawe yumva ibintu kimwe
I think the idea is small	Ntekereza ko igitekerezo ari gito
I can't figure out where we are	Sinshobora kumenya neza aho turi
But he did nothing wrong.	Ariko nta kibi yari yakoze.

I thought it was very possible	Natekereje ko bishoboka cyane
I didn't have to come	Sinari nkwiye kuza
You have to think about this.	Ugomba gutekereza kuri ibi.
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I have found what to do so far.	Nabonye ibyo gukora kugeza ubu.
It's just money.	Ni amafaranga gusa.
I knew what he meant to me	Nari nzi ibyo yashakaga kumbwira
I'm going home.	Ngiye gutaha.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
Good thinking is good.	Gutekereza neza ni byiza.
I didn't see it at the time	Icyo gihe sinigeze mbona
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
I really wanted to	Nashakaga cyane
But he would not go.	Ariko ntiyari kugenda.
I need to be better than that	Nkeneye kuba mwiza kurenza ibyo
This is great, and easy to do.	Ibi nibyiza, kandi byoroshye gukora.
I just did it all	Gusa nakoze ibyo byose
I wanted to know if you are at home	Nashakaga kumenya niba uri murugo
We now have a car.	Ubu dufite imodoka.
I can't stay away	Sinshobora kuguma kure
I feel good.	Numva neza.
I thought you wanted to be alone	Natekereje ko ushaka kuba wenyine
And everyone would know why.	Kandi abantu bose bari kumenya impamvu.
I hope you have something good for me	Nizere ko ufite ikintu cyiza kuri njye
I needed to live a short time	Nari nkeneye kubaho igihe gito
I think he will.	Ndakeka yuko azabikora.
Not on the phone.	Ntabwo ari kuri terefone.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
I know this to be true	Nzi ko ibi ari ukuri rwose
I feel very good.	Numva ari byiza cyane.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
I need to stop thinking about this	Nkeneye guhagarika gutekereza kuri ibi
He doesn't want to go back to that.	Ntabwo yifuza gusubira muri ibyo.
But no one would come.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wari kuza.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
It's a concern.	Ni impungenge.
That's not the way it is.	Ntabwo ari uburyo.
It's money.	Ni amafaranga.
I think this whole thing is good.	Ntekereza ko iki kintu cyose ari cyiza.
I didn't know what he was talking about	Sinari nzi ibyo avuga
Or he told me he was.	Cyangwa yambwiye ko ari.
They are years old.	Bafite imyaka.
That's what the family does	Nibyo umuryango ukora
There is nothing you can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora kuri ibi.
He was wearing something else.	Yari yambaye ikindi kintu.
He or she.	Ni we cyangwa twe.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
I want to ask more children	Ndashaka gusaba abana benshi
I can't believe it	Ntabwo nshobora kwizera
You probably did.	Birashoboka ko wabikoze.
I did normal things	Nakoze ibintu bisanzwe
I'm sure everything will be fine	Nzi neza ko ibintu byose bizaba byiza
People are worried.	Abantu bafite impungenge.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Well, it would be nice to try.	Nibyo, byari byiza kugerageza.
Always a lot of food.	Buri gihe ibiryo byinshi.
That's a good thing.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza.
Easy and simple.	Byoroshye byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
I was thinking about that	Natekerezaga kuri ibyo
Only people.	Abantu gusa.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
Not a good day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi mwiza.
The girl was.	Umukobwa yari.
I didn't know you could do this	Sinari nzi ko ushobora gukora ibi
I am very happy	Nishimiye cyane
I don't even want to be here.	Sinshaka no kuba hano.
All he said was.	Ibyo yavuze byose byari.
Everyone knows that is not true.	Abantu bose bazi ko ibyo atari ukuri.
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
I can get to know everyone.	Nshobora kumenya abantu bose.
He probably has tens.	Birashoboka ko afite mirongo.
And on and on no.	Kandi kuri no kuri no.
I never saw it	Sinigeze mbona
What he did, as usual.	Ibyo yakoze, nkuko bisanzwe.
I was scared at first	Nari mfite ubwoba mbere
He had to be good.	Yagombaga kuba mwiza.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
I think that was normal.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari bisanzwe.
I should have looked away	Nari nkwiye kureba kure
The player tried to take as many things as possible.	Umukinnyi yagerageje gufata ibintu byinshi bishoboka.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
It's always the same.	Buri gihe ni kimwe.
And he didn’t do it by playing.	Kandi ntabwo yabikoze mu gukina.
He loved what he did.	Yakundaga cyane ibyo yakoze.
Too many.	Benshi cyane.
I can live with that	Nshobora kubana nibyo
They were probably friends.	Birashoboka ko bari inshuti.
Let things go.	Kureka ibintu.
I think that's a good question.	Ntekereza ko ari ikibazo cyiza.
That is.	Icyo aricyo.
If not, we have a problem.	Niba atari byo, dufite ikibazo.
I need to do it.	Nkeneye kubikora.
I always think	Ntekereza kuri buri gihe
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
He is not very happy with you.	Ntabwo yishimiye cyane nawe.
He knows what he's talking about.	Azi ibyo avuga.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I don't know anything	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo cyose
Walking every morning.	Kugenda buri gitondo.
Money to buy food.	Amafaranga yo kugura ibiryo.
He didn't know what it was, but there was something.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo, ariko hari ikintu.
He can't walk much.	Ntashobora kugenda cyane.
The child was alone.	Umwana yari wenyine.
I actually thought of something for a while	Mubyukuri natekereje kuri twe ikintu mugihe gito
He has problems.	Afite ibibazo.
I have to do something	Ngomba gukora ikintu
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
No one knew he was here.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi ko ari hano.
But we can't.	Ariko ntidushobora.
You never know what you're going to get.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo ugiye kubona.
I can't do it from here.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora kuva hano.
I had a lot to drink, that’s all	Nari mfite byinshi byo kunywa, nibyo byose
He needs time.	Akeneye igihe.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
I should have been here earlier	Nari nkwiye kuba hano kare
I can't even live until it's time to eat	Ntabwo nshobora no kubaho kugeza igihe cyo kurya
But it probably didn't matter.	Ariko birashoboka ko ntacyo yari cyo.
He also knew the truth.	Yari azi kandi ukuri.
You can’t wait for more people.	Ntushobora gutegereza abantu benshi.
I needed him to talk later	Nari nkeneye ko avuga nyuma
I can't do that, not now	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ibyo, ntabwo ari ubu
I can't go much	Ntabwo nshobora kujyana byinshi
I don't want anything.	Ntacyo nshaka.
Maybe a lot now.	Ahari byinshi ubu.
You don't have to do it alone.	Ntugomba kubikora wenyine.
I wanted to go home at that time	Nashakaga gutaha icyo gihe
He also had many problems.	Yari afite kandi ibibazo byinshi.
I can't stay here	Sinshobora kuguma hano
I want to do this.	Ndashaka gukora ibi.
I can see nothing	Ntacyo nshobora kubona
But it is not very good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
I was only three years old at the time	Icyo gihe nari mfite imyaka itatu gusa
We were scared.	Twari dufite ubwoba.
I should have stayed there	Nari nkwiye kuguma aho
I ask everything now.	Ndabaza byose ubu.
Maybe we are.	Birashoboka ko turi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
But there is more.	Ariko hari byinshi.
I was very young at the time	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane
The woman outside is so beautiful.	Umugore uri hanze ni mwiza cyane.
Above.	Hejuru yo hejuru.
I don't want to stay in that room.	Sinshaka kuguma muri icyo cyumba.
He did exactly what he was supposed to do.	Yakoze rwose ibyo agomba kuba.
Someone can help.	Hari umuntu ushobora gufasha.
Very nice house.	Inzu nziza cyane.
I'm not sure what to do	Sinzi neza icyo gukora
This is what he told me.	Ibi ni byo yambwiye.
You can see everything.	Urashobora kureba kuri byose.
I don't want your clothes.	Sinshaka imyenda yawe.
But now you have to tell me the truth.	Ariko ubu ugomba kumbwira ukuri.
I never understood why	Sinigeze numva impamvu
For everyone.	Kuri buri wese.
I feel for him.	Ndumva kuri we.
The woman would not talk to you again.	Umugore ntiyari kongera kuvugana nawe.
To the top.	Kuri hejuru.
If it is good.	Niba ari byiza.
This person I know.	Uyu muntu nzi.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
I know what he does	Nzi icyo akora
Not bad, he is the only child.	Ntabwo ari mubi, ni umwana wenyine.
I need a little time	Nkeneye igihe gito
I mean not everything.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko atari byose.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
He would have hoped.	Yaba yizeye.
Another time.	Ikindi gihe.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
What he wanted.	Icyo yashakaga.
I really need to be with her.	Nkeneye kubana na we cyane.
He can't speak.	Ntashobora kuvuga.
You don't know what you saw.	Ntabwo uzi ibyo wabonye.
I said for a while	Nagize ngo igihe gito
I'm not going to say it right.	Ntabwo ngiye kuvuga neza.
Tom was not sure what to do.	Tom ntiyari azi neza icyo gukora.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba byiza.
I need time for myself sometimes	Nkeneye umwanya kuri njye rimwe na rimwe
I thought he looked good	Natekerezaga ko asa neza
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
I wouldn't be so good.	Ntabwo nari kuba mwiza cyane.
I work hard every week.	Nkora cyane buri cyumweru.
I want to know what you think	Ndashaka kumenya icyo utekereza
I can't believe my luck	Sinshobora kwizera amahirwe yanjye
He saw her eating something bad.	Yabonye arimo kurya ikintu kibi.
I am a good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza.
If one knows how to look.	Niba umuntu azi kureba.
I wanted to stay that way for a long time	Nashakaga kuguma gutya igihe kirekire
But this is the time to be.	Ariko uyu ni umwanya agomba.
That would not be the case.	Ntabwo aribyo byari kuba byinshi.
Eventually, he said.	Amaherezo, yavuze.
You are.	Urimo.
You were a boy.	Wari umuhungu.
I really didn’t have it all at the time	Ntabwo rwose nari mfite byose hamwe icyo gihe
I feel like he did something before	Mfite kumva ko hari icyo yakoze mbere
I think you are a friend	Ndatekereza ko uri inshuti
I like the way you think	Nkunda uburyo utekereza
He did not look away.	Ntabwo yarebye kure.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
He was here.	Yari hano.
I thought they were far from me	Natekerezaga ko bari kure yanjye
Everything is something.	Buri kintu ni ikintu.
I always think	Ntekereza buri gihe
It’s the same here and here.	Nibyo nka hano kandi hano.
I was young and beautiful	Nari muto kandi mwiza
I mean, we’re not something or anything	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo turi ikintu cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose
And he is right.	Kandi afite ukuri.
Here or not.	Hano cyangwa ntabwo.
I know nothing about this issue.	Ntacyo nzi kuri iki kibazo.
Dropping out of school.	Kureka ishuri.
Anyone can find a reason.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubona impamvu.
I think you have to go home, now	Ndatekereza ko ugomba gutaha, nonaha
Not that he needs to talk.	Ntabwo ari uko akeneye kuvuga.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu.
You are not doing this.	Ntabwo ukora ibi.
She loved clothes.	Yakundaga imyenda.
It worked really well.	Byagenze neza rwose.
Outside.	Hanze.
I know you can read this.	Nzi ko ushobora gusoma ibi.
You have to come.	Ugomba kuza.
Someone here.	Hano hari umuntu.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
I hope you have time	Nizere ko ufite umwanya
Whether it is a good thing or not.	Niba ari ikintu cyiza cyangwa atari cyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I did everything wrong	Nakoze ibintu byose nabi
You, me, can't do that alone.	Wowe, njye, ntidushobora kubikora wenyine.
I have not understood why so far	Sinigeze numva impamvu kugeza ubu
That's right.	Nukuri.
He was not lucky.	Ntabwo yari afite amahirwe.
I can't ask for anything else	Ntabwo nshobora gusaba ikindi kintu
Tell me that.	Mbwira ibyo.
But he has to act fast.	Ariko agomba gukora vuba.
He didn't even know where they were.	Ntiyari azi n'aho bari.
The good thing we have.	Ikintu cyiza dufite.
I don't know much about it.	Ntabwo nzi byinshi kuri byo.
That's all he can do.	Ibyo aribyo byose ashobora gukora.
You have to wait.	Ugomba gutegereza.
That was him.	Uwo yari we.
Apparently he was there before.	Biragaragara ko yari ahari mbere.
He has to do it on his own.	Agomba kubikora wenyine.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
It is not difficult to understand why.	Ntabwo bigoye kumva impamvu.
He chose to return home.	Yahisemo gushaka gutaha.
I never heard what he said	Sinigeze numva ibyo yavuze
It was too far to say exactly what it was.	Byari kure cyane kuvuga neza icyo aricyo.
He wanted to be here.	Yashakaga hano.
.	.
Just one.	Umwe gusa.
I wanted to talk to someone	Nashakaga kuvugana n'umuntu
I don't know who he is	Sinzi uwo ari we
The clothes, it looked.	Imyenda, yasaga.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Of course, there were a lot of people out there.	Nibyo, abantu bari hanze rwose bari benshi.
Or maybe it was easier than that.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko byari byoroshye kuruta ibyo.
I don't know everything.	Sinzi byose.
Really, really.	Nukuri, mubyukuri.
I'm glad to do that	Nishimiye kubikora
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
There are many.	Hariho benshi.
I want him to do something outside	Ndashaka ko agira icyo akora hanze
Me ?? 	Njye ??
I should have come to where you are	Nari nkwiye kuza aho uri
You can stay close.	Urashobora kuguma hafi.
I have a book on that.	Mfite igitabo kuri ibyo.
I can't do that	Sinshobora kubikora
I knew what you wanted	Nari nzi icyo ushaka
I like to make mistakes	Nkunda gukora amakosa
He was here, and he was not.	Yari hano, kandi ntabwo yari.
I never liked it	Sinigeze nkunda na gato
Stop talking.	Reka kuvuga.
You said a lot.	Wavuze ibintu byinshi.
I didn’t want to think about anything	Sinifuzaga gutekereza ku kintu na kimwe
I just wanted to know more and more	Nashakaga gusa kumenya neza kandi byose
But there is no reason to do that.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo gukora ibyo.
I wanted to drink more	Nashakaga kunywa byinshi
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I guess that's easy.	Ndakeka ko aribyo byoroshye.
If that is possible.	Niba ibyo bishoboka.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
That's not easy.	Ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
You would know more.	Wari kumenya byinshi.
They were probably family.	Birashoboka ko bari umuryango.
I really hope you were fine there	Nizere rwose ko wari mwiza aho
I enjoyed working until then.	Nishimiye gukora kugeza icyo gihe.
I have a lot to do	Mfite byinshi byo gukora
I was really embarrassed	Nagize isoni rwose
I like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I think you have to go	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kugenda
That would be difficult enough.	Ibyo byaba bigoye bihagije.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari ibintu na gato.
Really good question	Ikibazo cyiza rwose
None of us spoke.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wigeze avuga.
From the house.	Kuva mu nzu.
Everyone to everyone.	Umuntu wese kuri buri wese.
It wasn't you.	Ntabwo wari wowe.
There I am alone.	Hariho njye wenyine.
I guess he was right	Ndakeka ko yavuze ukuri
She loved to eat.	Yakundaga ibirori byo kurya.
I saw that tonight	Nabonye ko iri joro
That's right.	Nibyo ibi.
Not me.	Nta njye.
But there is more to come.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo kuza.
However, it is possible.	Ariko, birashoboka.
He made the wrong choice.	Yahisemo nabi.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
And no one saw it.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
After all, it’s just good.	Nyuma ya byose, ni byiza gusa.
And here.	Kandi hano.
We have something for everyone !.	Dufite ikintu kuri buri wese!.
I hope he does well	Nizere ko akora neza
I need to talk to you alone	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe wenyine
I mean you and everyone in this world	Ndashaka kuvuga wowe na buri muntu kuri iyi si

Her house was beautiful.	Inzu ye yari nziza.
I thought he was young	Natekereje ko yari muto
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I want to help your son.	Ndashaka gufasha umuhungu wawe.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
Working without problems.	Gukora nta kibazo.
You can learn to live.	Urashobora kwiga kubaho.
I think we can do a lot of good.	Ntekereza ko dushobora gukora byinshi byiza.
I feel like you have a really nice house	Ndumva ufite inzu nziza rwose
But let it be.	Ariko reka.

He was looking for his daughter.	Yashakaga umukobwa we.
I just want the truth	Ndashaka ukuri gusa
He has nothing.	Ntacyo afite.
I didn't know that about him	Sinari nzi ibyo kuri we
That's not really the case.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
He said he felt it.	Yavuze ko yumva.
This is not my son.	Uyu si umuhungu wanjye.
I mean, obviously one has to do it.	Ndashaka kuvuga, biragaragara ko umuntu agomba kubikora.
He always has a little boy.	Afite umuhungu muto buri gihe.
Very nice guy	Umusore mwiza cyane.
I always think	Ntekereza buri gihe
But no big deal.	Ariko nta kibazo kinini.
I know what he says is true	Nzi ko ibyo avuga ari ukuri
He doesn't have that.	Ibyo atari afite.
It was not for him.	Ntabwo yari kuri we.
I hope this is true	Nizera ko ibi ari ukuri
It feels great.	Yumva ari byiza cyane.
Woman.	Umugore.
I had a lot of questions, a lot of things to say	Nari mfite ibibazo byinshi, ibintu byinshi byo kuvuga

I need to find clothes	Nkeneye gushaka imyenda
I found a very good friend	Nabonye inshuti nziza cyane
Everyone wants to make money.	Umuntu wese arashaka gushaka amafaranga.
I didn’t want to have too many problems	Sinifuzaga kugira ibibazo byinshi
I was very close today	Uyu munsi nari hafi cyane
He just needed to live.	Yari akeneye gusa kubaho.
They were something.	Bari ikintu.
I mean, obviously one has to do it	Ndashaka kuvuga, biragaragara ko umuntu agomba kubikora
I just didn't feel like talking to you	Gusa sinigeze numva nshaka kuvugana nawe
He has problems.	Afite ibibazo.
I did not know who he was	Ntabwo nari nzi uwo ari we
I can buy this.	Nshobora kugura ibi.
He could see that it was too high.	Yashoboraga kubona ko ari hejuru cyane.
This is exactly what you need to do.	Ibi nibyo ukeneye gukora.
But this is true.	Ariko ibi ni ukuri.
Maybe we are.	Birashoboka ko turi.
But not in my house.	Ariko si mu nzu yanjye.
I didn’t think he had said anything before.	Sinatekerezaga ko hari ibyo yavuze mbere.
Let my hair go.	Reka umusatsi wanjye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari rwose.
But most people are not.	Ariko abantu benshi sibyo.
I was young too	Nanjye nari muto
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
You can't do much about it.	Ntushobora gukora byinshi kuri ibyo.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
It was good for us.	Byari byiza kuri twe.
I didn't want to live	Sinifuzaga kubaho

Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
I'm worried about him.	Mfite impungenge kuri we.
He must, but he cannot.	Agomba, ariko ntashobora.

I think in fact both are true	Ntekereza ko mubyukuri bombi ari ukuri
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
She was a smart girl.	Yari umukobwa uzi ubwenge.
It's just beautiful.	Ni mwiza gusa.
It was not a mistake.	Ntabwo byari amakosa.

I knew this was not true	Nari nzi ko ibyo atari ukuri
That's not the case now.	Ntabwo aribyo ubu.

However, this is good.	Ariko, ibi nibyiza.
He is on top.	Ari hejuru.
He can do it.	Arashobora kubikora.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
I know you want kids	Nzi ko ushaka abana

I'm sure he did.	Nzi neza ko yabikoze.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I have a problem with malnutrition	Ngomba kugira ikibazo cyo kurya nabi
There is one last thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe cya nyuma.
He went to work.	Yagiye ku kazi.
I heard he was scared	Numvise ko afite ubwoba
I'm glad that	Nishimiye ibyo
One has to be at home.	Umuntu agomba kuba murugo.
I like to drive my new friends	Nkunda gutwara inshuti yanjye nshya
That you are going to do what you really love.	Ko ugiye gukora ibyo ukunda rwose.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
And he thought so.	Kandi yatekereje ko aribyo.

Probably your daughter.	Birashoboka ko ari umukobwa wawe.

He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
Why was he here.	Kuki yari hano.
He would eat.	Yari kurya.
I'm not sure what to do.	Sinzi neza icyo gukora.
No need to be.	Nta mpamvu yo kuba.
Please, that's fine.	Nyamuneka, nibyiza.
He was not sure why he did it, only that it was good.	Ntabwo yari azi neza impamvu yabikoze, gusa ko byari byiza.
I had nothing.	Ntacyo nari mfite.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
It wasn’t just me.	Ntabwo yari njye gusa.

All of this was his fault.	Ibi byose byari amakosa ye.

We can't.	Ntidushobora.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.

I was completely out	Nari hanze rwose
I never thought much of it	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza cyane
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
And he always does it right	Kandi buri gihe abikora neza
He loved what he saw.	Yakundaga ibyo yabonye.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.

You don't know what to do.	Ntabwo uzi icyo ukora.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Ntiyari azi ikindi yashoboraga gukora.
It's here. 	Ndi hano.
'	'
I was going to be alone	Nari ngiye kuba wenyine
It's all normal.	Byose bisanzwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I really need to see outside.	Nkeneye kubona hanze cyane.
I am looking for my son	Ndimo ndashaka umuhungu wanjye
And he wanted to be her.	Kandi yashakaga ko ari we.
I have the same problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe
We just need one.	Dukeneye kimwe gusa.
I am whatever you are	Ndi icyo uri cyo cyose

I thought what you needed was me	Natekerezaga ko icyo ukeneye ari njye
I can't wait long	Sinshobora gutegereza igihe kirekire
This is normal.	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe.
He never spoke.	Ntabwo yigeze avuga.
There is.	Hariho.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Maybe I should have gone home	Birashoboka ko nari nkwiye gutaha
I only have one problem	Mfite ikibazo kimwe gusa
I thought it was me	Natekereje ko ari njye
No one has ever been good or bad.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze aba mwiza cyangwa mubi.
Most people have.	Abantu benshi bafite.
I need to see what he wants	Nkeneye kureba icyo ashaka
I think that's exactly what happened	Ntekereza ko aribyo rwose
He thought the same.	Yatekereje kimwe.
By now, that was enough.	Kuri ubu, ibyo byari bihagije.
I'm not good at waiting.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza gutegereza.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
It was all very high.	Byose byari hejuru cyane.
I can't imagine it will be so far away	Sinshobora gutekereza ko bizaba kure cyane
He got his money.	Yabonye amafaranga ye.
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
I was not very close to you	Ntabwo nari hafi yawe cyane
He can also do something.	Ashobora kandi kugira icyo akora.
Gone, gone.	Yagiye, yagiye.
We had no idea.	Ntabwo twari dufite igitekerezo.
Very good player, too	Umukinnyi mwiza cyane, kandi
We are nothing.	Ntacyo turi cyo.
Good things.	Ibintu byiza.
I was not sure	Sinari nzi neza
I love people.	Nkunda abantu.
I hope he does one day	Ndizera ko umunsi umwe azabikora
I don't want to know.	Sinshaka kumenya.
It's time.	Ni igihe.
I wonder if you can say the same	Ndabaza niba ushobora kuvuga kimwe
I can do things right	Nshobora gukora ibintu neza
Eventually, however, he agreed to do so.	Ariko, amaherezo, yemeye kubikora.
He had a family.	Yari afite umuryango.
But you just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ariko ukeneye amahirwe gusa.
There is so much for him.	Hariho byinshi kuri we.
He is a player.	Ni umukinnyi.
I think that's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko icyo ari ikintu cyiza.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
And inside, again.	Kandi imbere, kandi.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yari ubwoba.
He wants so badly.	Ashaka nabi cyane.
This is the end.	Ibi ni amaherezo.
You think ahead.	Utekereza imbere.
I should live with him	Nkwiye kubana na we
I think that is easy	Ntekereza ko ibyo byoroshye
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
I can't figure out what he's looking for	Sinshobora kumenya icyo arimo gushaka
He was in school.	Yari mu ishuri.
They were finally close.	Amaherezo bari hafi.
I need to help make things better	Ngomba gufasha gukora ibintu neza
It's not the same thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe.
I believe that is true	Nizera ko ibyo ari ukuri
Most of the time, he knew he was right.	Byinshi kugeza aho, yari azi ko afite ukuri.
I can't go back like that	Sinshobora gusubira inyuma gutya
I feel good about everything	Ndumva ari byiza kuri byose
The last thing.	Ikintu cya nyuma.
The problem is not that.	Ikibazo ntabwo aricyo.
I can't believe how easy that is	Sinshobora kwizera uburyo ibyo byoroshye
I'm sure it's good.	Nzi neza ko ari byiza.
He got food later.	Yabonye ibiryo nyuma.
I hope his car is nearby	Ndizera ko imodoka ye iri hafi hano
That's right.	Nukuri.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
I'm glad he didn't	Nishimiye ko atabikoze
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
It will not be enough for everyone.	Ntabwo bizaba bihagije kuri bose.
I thought it was great	Natekereje ko ari byiza cyane
Everyone needs a good friend.	Umuntu wese akeneye inshuti nziza.
There is, but far from now.	Hariho, ariko kure cyane ubu.
Maybe there is a truth to the truth.	Ahari hariho n'ukuri kuri kuri.
I know you may have something to do	Nzi ko ushobora kuba ufite icyo ugomba gukora
But sometimes, it is.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe, ni.
I don’t believe he did it wearing his clothes	Ntabwo nizera ko yabikoze yambaye imyenda ye
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
He thought I was scared.	Yatekereje ko mfite ubwoba.
I needed to get out of the house	Nari nkeneye kuva mu nzu
I feel like you know something	Ndumva hari icyo uzi
It is not wise.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He wanted to speak well.	Yashakaga kuvuga neza.
I have to do it right	Ngomba kubikora neza
You don't have to be here.	Ntagomba kuba hano.
I know exactly what you are going to say	Nzi neza ibyo ugiye kuvuga
He must be working.	Agomba kuba akora.
I thought about that too.	Nanjye natekereje kuri ibyo.
He is behind her.	Ari inyuma ye.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I didn't know much about it	Ntabwo nari nzi byinshi kuri byo
But it is very good.	Ariko nibyiza cyane.
It was hard to win.	Byari bigoye gutsinda.
I never saw him do that	Sinigeze mbona abikora
He just told me he was doing it.	Yambwiye gusa ko abikora.
For everything.	Kuri byose.
He really doesn't do anything.	Mubyukuri ntacyo akora.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
We had nothing.	Ntacyo twari dufite.
I hadn’t thought much of it	Sinari natekereje kure
I love the people of the world	Nkunda abantu b'isi
But today, here we are.	Ariko uyu munsi, hano turi.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari afite.
I am always scared	Mfite ubwoba buri gihe
You are going to marry a young woman, a family.	Ugiye gushaka umugore muto, umuryango.
But how long.	Ariko kugeza ryari.
I wonder why he did it	Ndabaza impamvu yabikoze
I like being a guy.	Nkunda kuba umusore.
He has been doing so.	Yagiye abikora.
This is everyone.	Uyu ni abantu bose.
Something he wanted from a young age.	Ikintu yashakaga kuva akiri muto.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko nibyiza.
They have one daughter.	Bafite umukobwa umwe.
I can't say what he thinks	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo atekereza
School, once.	Ishuri, rimwe.
I doubt if he knew anything at all	Ndashidikanya niba hari icyo azi na gato
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri ibyo
In a short time, they were all together.	Mu gihe gito, bose bari hamwe.
I had my time.	Nari mfite umwanya wanjye.
He saw.	Yabonye.
The woman told her family what had happened.	Umugore yabwiye umuryango we uko byagenze.
I am a girl.	Ndi umukobwa.
I have a daughter.	Mfite umukobwa.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
It's really good.	Ni byiza rwose.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
I'm sure you have a lot of problems	Nzi neza ko ufite ibibazo byinshi
No job.	Nta kazi.
It was not for me.	Ntabwo byari kuri njye.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
He says the job.	Avuga ko akazi.
No one was right.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite ukuri.
I can travel in all three worlds	Nshobora kugenda muri iyi si uko ari itatu
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
I got it wrong.	Nabonye nabi.
I don't want to be there.	Sinshaka ko ahari.
I knew he couldn't tell me	Nari nzi ko adashobora kumbwira

He did this.	Yakoze iki kintu.
I want to be that person	Ndashaka kuba uwo muntu
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I saw good things.	Nabonye ibintu byiza.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga.
I never thought of one	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza kuri kimwe
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
I mean, for each of them	Ndashaka kuvuga, kuri buri kimwe muri byo
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
I don’t think we can think of him	Ntabwo ntekereza ko dushobora gutekereza hamwe na we
I have a problem though	Mfite ikibazo ariko
They were scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba.
There are clothes here.	Hano hari imyenda.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I did not hear	Ntabwo numvise
I need to get out of that house	Nkeneye kuva muri iyo nzu
He was not.	Ntabwo yari.
He did not want to do that.	Ntiyashakaga kubikora.
He should have said something.	Yari akwiye kugira icyo avuga.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
But he never had a chance.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze agira amahirwe.
He was behind.	Yari inyuma.
You were then.	Icyo gihe wari.
Good morning.	Neza na kare.

That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's a wonderful thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyane.
She feels scared.	Yumva afite ubwoba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I was a bad woman	Nari umugore mubi
I didn't know what to think	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I was an outsider	Nari umuntu wo hanze
I think of things.	Ndatekereza ibintu.
I don't know if that's the case.	Sinzi niba aribyo.
He had nothing wrong with that.	Nta kibi rwose yari afite.
I should have gone earlier	Nari nkwiye kugenda kare
I did a lot of things	Nakoze ibintu byinshi
Too much waiting.	Gutegereza cyane.

Absolutely.	Nukuri cyane.
But he was not there.	Ariko ntiyari ahari.
This is possible above.	Ibi birashoboka hejuru.
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.

Things are normal for him	Ibintu bisanzwe kuri we
This is his time.	Iki ni cyo gihe cye.

At the time, I knew we had to go	Icyo gihe nari nzi ko tugomba kugenda
Not at that time.	Ntabwo icyo gihe.
He was not sure what to say.	Ntiyari azi neza ibyo avuga.
If there is a short time.	Niba hari umwanya muto.
I didn’t want to take the time	Sinifuzaga gufata umwanya
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
I needed this.	Nari nkeneye ibi.
I saw things.	Nabonye ibintu.
I never saw what you had	Sinigeze mbona ibyo ufite
It's one of those things.	Ni kimwe muri buri kintu.

He looked outside.	Yarebye hanze.
I didn’t want to go back to that	Sinifuzaga gusubira kuri ibyo
He has to go with you.	Agomba kujyana nawe.
I definitely should go back to school	Nkwiye rwose gusubira ku ishuri
Like me, really.	Nkanjye, mubyukuri.
Obviously things were difficult.	Biragaragara ko ibintu byari bigoye.

And sometimes not.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe sibyo.

I wasn't sure if that was the right thing to do	Sinari nzi neza ko aricyo kintu cyiza cyo gukora
The boy said nothing.	Umuhungu ntacyo yavuze.
One day, he left.	Umunsi umwe, yagiye.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He didn't want to come here, he wasn't very far away.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuza hano, ntabwo ari kure cyane.
Tell me something.	Mbwira ikintu.

He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko afite amahirwe.
I think you should do the same	Ndatekereza ko nawe ugomba kubikora
I like to have everyone at home.	Nkunda kugira abantu bose murugo.

I was not sure what he meant	Sinari nzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga
I want to do it	Ndashaka kubikora
You have it all.	Ufite byose.

He may have.	Ashobora kuba afite.

I really think so.	Ndatekereza rwose.
That's right.	Nukuri.
He had to find something else.	Yagombaga gushaka ikindi kintu.
Indeed, it is true.	Nukuri, ni ukuri.
His wife.	Umugore we.
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
I'm afraid he did	Mfite ubwoba ko yabikoze
They have.	Bafite.
But in reality,.	Ariko mubyukuri,.
All the same is possible.	Byose kimwe birashoboka.
I was looking for one.	Nashakaga umwe.
I am not your friend or anything else	Ntabwo ndi inshuti yawe cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose
Down here down.	Hano hano hasi.
I can wait a long time	Nshobora gutegereza igihe kirekire

He would not go far.	Ntabwo yari kujya kure.
I never wanted him to say anything else	Sinigeze nshaka ko agira ikindi avuga
I thought we could do it	Natekerezaga ko dushobora kubikora
Good boy, really	Umuhungu mwiza, kuri
However, in this world.	Ariko, kuri iyi si.
You know what to do.	Uzi icyo ugomba gukora.
Well done, your son.	Nibyiza, umuhungu wawe.
And that is not a trivial matter.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari ikintu gito.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
And they were here.	Kandi bari hano.
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
You have to talk to him.	Ugomba kuvugana nawe.
I'm good at that.	Ndi mwiza kuri ibyo.
Things are not good for us.	Ibintu ntabwo ari byiza kuri twe.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
In fact, it's really good.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
He seemed young.	Yasaga naho ari muto.

I'm glad he did	Nishimiye ibyo yakoze
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
I can't wait	Sinshobora gutegereza
Anyone can tell my age.	Umuntu wese arashobora kuvuga imyaka yanjye.
He did not know if he had time.	Ntiyari azi niba afite umwanya.
I knew it was a mistake	Nari nzi ko ari amakosa
I can't say here	Sinshobora kuvuga aha
But he is scared.	Ariko afite ubwoba.
I knew exactly what he meant	Nari nzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
That was exactly what he needed.	Ibyo aribyo yari akeneye.
I want to feel closer	Ndashaka kumva hafi
And everything will be just that.	Kandi ibintu byose bizaba gusa.
I wanted to do all that	Nashakaga gukora ibyo byose
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.	Birashoboka ko nkora ikintu kibi.
I didn’t think it was possible	Sinatekerezaga ko bishoboka
He looked away.	Yarebye kure.
There is no truth.	Nta kuri.
I thought it was you, not me	Natekereje ko ari wowe kibazo, ntabwo ari njye
He knew everything and everyone.	Yari azi byose kandi abantu bose.
He made everything easy.	Yakoze ibintu byose byoroshye.
I was here before.	Nari hano mbere.
I don’t want her to be a woman.	Sinshaka ko aba umugore.
This is not the case.	Uyu ntabwo aribyo.
I want money	Ndashaka amafaranga
I have not heard what he meant so far	Sinigeze numva icyo yashakaga kuvuga kugeza ubu
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
I heard.	Numvise.
But until then you have to stay here.	Ariko kugeza icyo gihe ugomba kuguma hano.
It is not your family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango wawe.
I wanted the same thing	Nashakaga ikintu kimwe
I have a lot of plans for today	Mfite gahunda nyinshi kuri uyumunsi
I didn't need to.	Sinari nkeneye.
Over time	Kurenza igihe.
He used to have someone in the house.	Yakundaga kugira umuntu mu nzu.
But that.	Ariko ibyo.
I don't know what to do about it	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora kuri ibyo
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo sibyo.
I know what he's up to	Nzi ibyo arimo
I know you love all this	Nzi ko ukunda ibi byose
That's right.	Nibyo.
I never trusted anyone so quickly	Ntabwo nigeze nizera umuntu vuba vuba
I can't do anything wrong	Ntabwo nshobora gukora ikintu kibi
I am learning a lot	Ndimo kwiga byinshi
I mean, this was it.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibi byari.
I saw nothing	Ntacyo nabonye
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
I know your family	Nzi umuryango wawe
He would have gone.	Yaba yagiye.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
Stop doing it.	Reka kubikora.
I want to be young again	Ndashaka kongera kuba muto
I want this.	Ndashaka ibi.
I have everything tonight	Mfite ibintu byose muri iri joro
He knows it's not true.	Azi ko atari byo.
I can get along well.	Nshobora kubana neza.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
I have a lot of friends here	Mfite inshuti nyinshi hano
I have no one in me	Nta muntu mfite muri njye
I want to be me again	Ndashaka kongera kuba njye
He asked to do well.	Yasabye gukora neza.
He was not just an expert.	Ntiyari umuhanga gusa.
But he saw something else.	Ariko yabonye ikindi kintu.
Of course, everyone is.	Ni ukuri, abantu bose ni.
I can do a lot.	Nshobora gukora byinshi.
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
He can walk for a long time.	Ashobora kugenda igihe kirekire.
People are people.	Abantu ni abantu.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
They are many.	Ni benshi.
But I can't.	Ariko ntashobora.
I just don't know what else to do.	Gusa sinzi ikindi gukora.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
I wanted both of me	Nashakaga bombi muri njye
I wanted to talk to him.	Nashakaga kuvugana na we.
I don't know where.	Sinzi aho.
I didn't know it here	Ntabwo nari nzi hano
I don't know what to do with this.	Sinzi icyo gukora muri ibi.
I can't think of anything else to do	Sinshobora gutekereza ikindi kintu cyo gukora
That's what you do.	Nibyo ukora.
You are.	Uri we.
I had the money	Nari mfite amafaranga
It's not just good.	Ntabwo ari byiza gusa.
I wasn't sure if I was a bad girl	Ntabwo nari nzi neza ko ndi umukobwa mubi
I think it was good	Ntekereza ko byari byiza
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I should have done it on time	Nari nkwiye kubikora ku gihe
I feel this is the best time	Ndumva iki aricyo gihe cyiza
I need you to do well	Nkeneye ko ukora neza
They had nothing.	Nta na kimwe bari bafite.
I had an idea.	Nari mfite igitekerezo.
I should have gone home	Nari nkwiye gutaha
I really want to be with you	Ndashaka kubana nawe rwose
He loved work.	Yakundaga akazi.
He thought it was never enough.	Yatekereje ko nta na rimwe bihagije.
Another thing is food.	Ikindi kintu ni ibiryo.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
I know exactly what you are doing	Nzi neza ibyo ukora
That is wisdom.	Ibyo ni ubwenge.
I want to be a better person.	Ndashaka kuba umuntu mwiza.
I thought about that	Natekereje kuri ibyo
He tried to eat.	Yagerageje kurya.
I didn't know you were friends	Sinari nzi ko uri inshuti
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane
I can't wait	Sinshobora gutegereza
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
We have to think.	Tugomba gutekereza.
I really need to know how to do it	Nkeneye rwose kumenya kubikora
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga kimwe muri ibyo
I had friends, family	Nari mfite inshuti, umuryango
But it is not close enough.	Ariko ntabwo ari hafi bihagije.
I want to be that person	Ndashaka kuba uwo muntu
Whether on the phone or doing something else.	Yaba kuri terefone cyangwa gukora ikindi kintu.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
For him though, age is a problem.	Kuri we naho, imyaka ni ikibazo.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
He had a lot of people.	Yari afite abantu benshi.
I didn't know either	Nanjye sinari nzi
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
You have everything '.	Ufite byose '.
I didn't have many friends	Ntabwo nari mfite inshuti nyinshi
I hope you are fine too.	Nizere ko nawe uri mwiza.
Or even to eat.	Cyangwa no kurya.
We have that.	Dufite ibyo.
He didn't look like her though.	Ntabwo yasaga na we ariko.
My son is ready to marry.	Umuhungu wanjye yiteguye gushaka umugore.
I can't wait long	Sinshobora gutegereza igihe kirekire
And good.	Kandi nziza.
I think you said enough.	Ntekereza ko wavuze bihagije.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari we wenyine.
Everything we had, was not good enough.	Ibyo twari dufite byose, ntabwo byari byiza bihagije.
It worked out so well	Byagenze neza cyane
I never saw him go	Sinigeze mbona agenda
I didn't see it here tonight	Sinigeze mbona hano muri iri joro
I thought he meant it too	Natekereje ko nawe ashaka kuvuga
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I am very beautiful	Ndi mwiza cyane
I knew exactly where they were	Nari nzi rwose aho bari
You really can't go wrong.	Mubyukuri ntushobora kugenda nabi.
I thought it was a good book.	Natekereje ko ari igitabo cyiza.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Trying to talk to you.	Kugerageza kuvugana nawe.
I just feel that way	Gusa ndumva aribyo rwose
But the player must have his place.	Ariko umukinnyi agomba kuba afite umwanya we.
I would not talk to him	Sinari kuvugana na we
I just want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe gusa
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
He had problems.	Yari afite ibibazo.
He is not just one person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu umwe gusa.
He said.	Yavuze.
That's not the case with this movie.	Ntabwo aribyo muri iyi firime.
I thought of many good things.	Natekereje ku byiza byinshi.
He wants the worst.	Arashaka mubi.
I found one.	Nabonye umwe.
Today.	Uyu munsi.
He knew how to talk people down.	Yari azi kuvuga abantu hasi.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
Everyone is on the phone.	Abantu bose bari kuri terefone.
It is not for him.	Ntabwo ari kuri we.
You can't have it.	Ntushobora kugira.
I love things the way I want them to be	Nkunda ibintu uko nshaka
You said you wanted to.	Wavuze ko ushaka.
You have to come well	Ugomba kuza neza
It was very high.	Yari hejuru cyane.
I am not one.	Ntabwo ndi umwe.
I'm really you	Ndi wowe rwose
It would be easy.	Byaba byoroshye.
I knew	Nari nzi
I can't see any of it.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu na kimwe muri byo.
I had no idea.	Ntacyo natekereje.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I am that person.	Ndi uwo muntu.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
Whatever he says, he is right.	Ibyo avuga byose, afite ukuri.
I don't know who he is	Sinzi uwo ari we
No one knew why.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi impamvu.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
I like to read now.	Nkunda gusoma ubu.
I shouldn't go	Ntabwo nkwiye kugenda
This one said nothing outside.	Uyu ntacyo yavuze hanze.
I didn't know what to believe	Sinari nzi icyo nizera
I am doing it now	Ubu ndimo kubikora
Either way he could go.	Ibyo ari byo byose yashoboraga kugenda.
He was about to leave.	Yari agiye kuva muri ibi.
You are working alone.	Urimo gukora wenyine.
Where he was.	Aho yari ari.
I felt ashamed	Numvise mfite isoni
Just once.	Rimwe gusa.
I wanted to know why.	Nashakaga kumenya impamvu.
You can't go back.	Ntushobora gusubira inyuma.
Here, here.	Hano, hano.
I don't do anything early.	Nta kintu na kimwe nkora kare.
I needed a new car	Nari nkeneye imodoka nshya
I can't stay here	Sinshobora kuguma hano
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo tugomba kureba.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva hano.
Absolutely.	Hariho rwose.
I have what I believe.	Mfite ibyo nizera.
He knew what we were up to.	Yari azi icyo turi cyo.
Or something bad.	Cyangwa ikintu kibi.
This sounds like it.	Ibi birasa.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I could never do that.	Sinigeze nshobora kubikora.
I can do nothing here.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora hano.
She is my daughter	Ni umukobwa wanjye
And that would be enough.	Kandi ibyo byaba bihagije.
I know people very well	Nzi abantu neza
I need something.	Nkeneye ikintu.
I was lucky enough to leave	Nagize amahirwe yo kuva aho
It will be good to wait !.	Bizaba byiza gutegereza!.
No one is around tonight.	Nta muntu uri hafi muri iri joro.
That's what he always does.	Nibyo buri gihe akora.
I think he knew he didn't have a long life to live	Ntekereza ko yari azi ko adafite igihe kirekire cyo kubaho
He was out working.	Yari hanze akora.
But for me.	Ariko kuri njye.
He did not want help.	Ntiyashakaga ubufasha.
I felt scared about it	Numvise mfite ubwoba kuri byo
You can have money.	Urashobora kugira amafaranga.
I want to know exactly what happened	Ndashaka kumenya neza uko byagenze
I never wanted to	Sinigeze nshaka
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu aribyo.
I have a lot to do	Mfite ibintu byinshi byo gukora
It would be easy.	Byaba byoroshye.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
It was great, like a movie.	Byari byiza, nka firime.
I did not know who he was	Sinari nzi uwo ari we
I didn't know what he was thinking	Sinari nzi icyo yatekerezaga
I just wanted a wife	Nashakaga gusa umugore
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo, ariko ntashobora kumenya neza.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I don't want anything.	Ntacyo nshaka.
I think he feels good	Ntekereza ko yumva ari byiza
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo yari cyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was good, very good, and really good.	Byari byiza, byiza cyane, kandi mubyukuri.
They both deal with their confidence as they choose to embark on their play activities.	Bombi nta ubwenge.
It is not wise.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge.
First place.	Umwanya wa mbere.
I thought this was a good idea	Natekereje ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
But we have to act fast.	Ariko tugomba gukora vuba.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
That's good right now.	Nibyiza kuri ubu.
Where was he now?	Ubu yari he?.
I also think this is a good idea	Ndatekereza kandi ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza
He needed a plan.	Yari akeneye gahunda.
I had enough of that	Nari mfite ibyo bihagije
I thought about coming home	Natekereje cyane gutaha
I hope it wasn't his daughter who did it	Nizere ko atari umukobwa we yabikoze
I knew exactly what he was thinking	Nari nzi neza icyo yatekerezaga
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
I knew what he was thinking	Nari nzi icyo atekereza
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I know she is a beautiful girl	Nzi ko ari umukobwa mwiza
He needed to know better.	Yari akeneye kumenya neza.
I thought we had something	Natekereje ko hari icyo dufite
I am whatever you may be	Ndi ikintu cyose ushobora kuba cyo
I can't go back in time	Sinshobora gusubira mu gihe
I saw absolutely nothing about that	Ntacyo nabonye rwose kuri ibyo
I haven't seen it since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona
I should have walked away from him	Nari nkwiye kugenda kure ye
I don't know why here	Sinzi impamvu ari hano
I have occasionally	Mfite rimwe na rimwe
Having the same problem.	Kugira ikibazo kimwe.
In his time.	Mugihe we.
No one said anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira icyo avuga.
We didn't have much money.	Ntabwo twari dufite amafaranga menshi.
I never felt so loved and loved	Sinigeze numva nkunda cyane kandi nkunda
He was right about me.	Yari afite ukuri kuri njye.
I think you can see that that is true	Ntekereza ko ushobora kubona ko ibyo ari ukuri
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
We have it easy.	Dufite byoroshye.
I have nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe mfite
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I wanted to help people	Nashakaga gufasha abantu
He has to come.	Agomba kuza.
You have to be.	Ugomba kuba.
I'm sure he knew what he was talking about.	Nzi neza ko yari azi ibyo avuga.
He wanted to go back.	Yashakaga gusubira inyuma.
I didn't know you had it in you	Sinari nzi ko ufite muri wowe
Things are this way.	Ibintu ni ibi.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
He knows nothing.	Nta na kimwe azi.
I was bad and scared to do it again	Nari mubi kandi mfite ubwoba bwo kongera kubikora
I can't see anything wrong.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona ikintu kibi.
I always have a reading book	Buri gihe mfite igitabo cyo gusoma
You got a job.	Wabonye akazi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You don't have to do anything.	Ntugomba gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I didn't have time for that	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya kubyo
I really need to try harder	Nkeneye rwose kugerageza cyane
I didn't really know what it was	Ntabwo nari nzi rwose icyo aricyo
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
I never wanted to.	Sinigeze nshaka.
I'm happy for both of you	Nishimiye bombi
It's all like.	Byose nka.
Eating good food.	Kurya ibiryo byiza.
I'm not sure he knows what time it is.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko azi icyo aricyo gihe.
He thought so.	Yatekereje ko aribyo.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
We have almost everything.	Dufite ibintu hafi ya byose.
Maybe we need time outside.	Ahari dukeneye umwanya hanze.
I haven't seen much	Sinigeze mbona byinshi
All of us.	Twese.
Lots.	Byinshi.
Space.	Umwanya.
He loved to play	Yakundaga gukina
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza cyane.
The one you have now.	Uwo ufite ubu.
It’s not a party.	Ntabwo ari ibirori.
You must be old enough to drink.	Ugomba kuba ufite imyaka yo kunywa.
This was very difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye cyane.
This is good for that.	Ibi nibyiza kuri ibyo.
I can't think of anything better than this	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza ikintu cyiza kuruta ibi
I can't think of anything else to do	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza gukora ikindi kintu
And bad.	Kandi mubi.
I am for him.	Njye kuri we.
Just one question.	Ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I just need to be a little higher	Nkeneye gusa kuba hejuru gato
I didn’t want to wait too long	Sinifuzaga gutegereza hafi
You have to be simple.	Ugomba kuba byoroshye.
I can't go back	Sinshobora gusubira kure
It was a really good day.	Wari umunsi mwiza rwose.
He wanted to be beautiful there.	Yashakaga kuba mwiza aho.
I thought it was good	Natekereje ko ari byiza
I should have stayed away.	Nari nkwiye kuguma kure.
He has no talent.	Ntabwo afite impano.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He thought I had seen it.	Yatekereje ko nabonye.
The truth is.	Ukuri ni.
I'm glad he's home	Nishimiye ko ari murugo
I have a lot to do	Mfite byinshi byo gukora
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
And especially here.	Kandi cyane cyane hano.
I think he just needs time.	Ntekereza ko akeneye igihe gusa.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
In the morning	Mu gitondo.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
It’s not money, it’s my family.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga, ni umuryango wanjye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Something to catch.	Ikintu cyo gufata.
I need to see this new world	Nkeneye kubona iyi si nshya
You want to see things.	Urashaka kubona ibintu.
And he knew what to do.	Kandi yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
I was really lucky to be here	Nagize amahirwe rwose kuba hano
But he must.	Ariko agomba.
Anyone.	Umuntu wese uwo ari we wese.
I was sure that	Nari nzi neza ko
I need to do something	Nkeneye kugira icyo nkora
I had nothing	Nta na kimwe nari mfite
I want to know what the problem is.	Ndashaka kumenya ikibazo icyo aricyo.
I'm worried about him	Mfite impungenge kuri we
I don't get the idea.	Ntabwo mbona igitekerezo.
Yaba.	Yaba.
I hope that will happen soon	Ndizera ko ibyo bizaba vuba aha
I wasn't sure if you could do it	Sinari nzi neza ko ushobora kubikora
Before or now.	Mbere cyangwa ubu.
I was ashamed of him.	Nagize isoni kuri we.
And all this is true.	Kandi ibi byose ni ukuri.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
So far, so good.	Kugeza vuba aha, nibyo.
She wants her baby.	Ashaka umwana we.
You can do it right.	Urashobora kubikora neza.
And we need help.	Kandi dukeneye ubufasha.
It’s not just a problem for me.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri njye gusa.
I also want to go home	Ndashaka no gutaha
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekereje.
I know you can do better	Nzi ko ushobora gukora neza
I didn't hear anything	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise
I didn't mean to offend you	Ntabwo nashakaga kuvuga kimwe
Or to be ashamed.	Cyangwa no kugira isoni.
You can't get long.	Ntushobora kubona igihe kinini.
I can't stay away from him	Sinshobora kuguma kure ye
He just told me.	Yambwiye gusa.
This is my house.	Iyi ni inzu yanjye.
Time to think.	Igihe cyo gutekereza.
I needed to go	Nari nkeneye kujyana
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
I didn't know where we could go	Sinari nzi aho dushobora kujya
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I didn't even know how to do it	Sinari nzi no kubikora
Walking backwards.	Kugenda inyuma.
I needed to know	Nari nkeneye kumenya
I think we have a lot of luck	Ntekereza ko dufite amahirwe menshi
You are a smart guy.	Uri umusore uzi ubwenge.
I saw that he wanted something	Nabonye ko hari icyo yashakaga
It really didn't work out.	Ntabwo rwose byari byagenze neza.
I just don’t know how so far.	Gusa sinzi uko kugeza ubu.
He knew he had to say something.	Yari azi ko agomba kugira ikindi avuga.
I can't really hear anything	Ntabwo nshobora rwose kumva ikintu na kimwe
He realized that he had made a mistake	Yabonye ko yakoze amakosa
I know this is my family right now	Nzi ko uyu ari umuryango wanjye ubu
Of course you can't be that way.	Nukuri ntushobora kuba uko.
And that's not true.	Kandi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I'm in this.	Ndi muri ibi.
We just have to go.	Tugomba kugenda gusa.
Since then, there has been no turning back.	Kuva icyo gihe, nta gusubira inyuma.
Inside.	Imbere.
I needed to know what he meant	Nari nkeneye kumenya icyo yashakaga kuvuga
He thought it was possible.	Yatekereje ko bishoboka.
I also wanted help	Nashakaga kandi nkeneye ubufasha
Or he went.	Cyangwa yagiye.
Like a movie, it’s not very good.	Nka firime, ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
And that he did.	Kandi ko yabikoze.
Easy and simple.	Byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
It is impossible for us to do that.	Ntabwo bishoboka kuri twe kubikora.
Why did he come? 	Kuki yaje?
But he had.	Ariko yari afite.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
In fact it was.	Mubyukuri byari.
I know something too	Nanjye hari icyo nzi
He had a job.	Yari afite akazi.
It is very good and simple.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byoroshye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
I wanted to be human	Nashakaga kuba umuntu
I just wanted to know if you know a guy.	Gusa nashakaga kumenya niba uzi umusore.
I got the idea here	Nabonye igitekerezo hano
I have to think first	Ngomba gutekereza mbere
He had a lot of problems for her	Yari afite ibibazo byinshi kuri we
I know you can do it	Nzi ko ushobora kubikora
I think that was a mistake	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari amakosa
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I believe it is something else.	Nizera ko ari ikindi kintu.
I'm good at that.	Ndi mwiza kuri ibyo.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I didn't know anyone well	Ntabwo nari nzi neza umuntu
He really is.	Arimo rwose.
I think it's possible.	Ntekereza ko bishoboka.
I can't see this	Sinshobora kubona ibi
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari.
Away from him	Kure ye.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
I was a child.	Nari umwana.
He did not know exactly what that was.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
But there is something about knowing someone from the beginning.	Ariko hariho ikintu cyo kumenya umuntu kuva mbere.
Most of the time it was good for me.	Igihe kinini yari mwiza kuri njye.
You can go and see.	Urashobora kujya kureba.
He wanted it there.	Yashakaga aho.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo ugomba kumenya.
I needed to wait	Nari nkeneye gutegereza
I was sure there was.	Nari nzi neza ko ahari.
I feel better now than ever.	Ndumva ubu kuruta ikindi gihe cyose.
No one said it was easy.	Nta muntu wavuze ko byoroshye.
I can't take anything else	Ntabwo nshobora gufata ikindi
I was scared	Nagize ubwoba
Here's your guy.	Hano hari umusore wawe.
I didn't hear anything	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise
I saw it all	Nabonye byose
It was something.	Yari ikintu.
I never thought	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza
You are not good enough.	Ntabwo uri mwiza bihagije.
I wouldn't know why	Ntabwo nari kumenya impamvu
You know what you're doing.	Uzi icyo ukora.
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Nashakaga kumenya icyo atekereza
He thought well.	Yatekereje neza.
I'm afraid you want to say bad things	Mfite ubwoba ko ushaka kuvuga nabi
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
We are a family.	Turi umuryango.
I want more to stay	Ndashaka byinshi byo kuguma
This movie is great.	Iyi firime ni nziza cyane.
I think that's why he came here today	Ntekereza ko ari yo mpamvu yaje hano uyu munsi
I have never heard of this	Sinigeze numva ibi
It was outside.	Byari hanze.
You are fine.	Ufite neza.
I knew he was out	Nari nzi ko ari hanze
I have to go quickly	Ngomba kugenda vuba
Woman, in all things	Umugore, muri byose
There are a lot of mistakes here.	Hano hari amakosa menshi.
No one has ever done anything.	Nta muntu wigeze akora ikintu.
I have never done anything about it	Ntacyo nigeze nkora kuri kimwe muri ibyo
We have to get out of here, now.	Tugomba kuva hano, ubu.
I needed to be with him now	Nari nkeneye kubana na we ubu
I have to think fast	Ngomba gutekereza vuba
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
We don't even have to stay.	Ntabwo tugomba no kuguma.
I knew exactly where he would be	Nari nzi neza aho azaba ari
Today.	Uyu munsi.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari byose.
Her son says he has no problem drinking.	Umuhungu we avuga ko nta kibazo cyo kunywa afite.
I think he’s just scared.	Ntekereza ko afite ubwoba gusa.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
It's stuff.	Ni ibintu.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Probably you.	Birashoboka ko ari wowe.
He went far, far away.	Yagiye kure, hejuru.
As long as he wanted.	Igihe cyose yashakaga.
As he had.	Nkuko yari afite.
This is normal.	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I have a lot of money	Mfite amafaranga menshi
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
He was also a teacher.	Na we yari umwarimu.
I didn’t want him to go	Sinifuzaga ko agenda
He really did go.	Yagiye rwose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I love the whole family	Nkunda umuryango wose
I can do good things	Nshobora gukora ibintu byiza
It's not too early.	Ntabwo ari kare cyane.
I was a travel expert	Nari umuhanga mu kugenda
Live well	Kubaho neza
I want to talk to you	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe
He knew nothing about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi neza.
I needed time to catch up	Nari nkeneye umwanya wo gufata
I wanted to go home	Nari nshaka gutaha
I can't wait to get out of here	Sinshobora gutegereza kuva hano
He would not swim too much.	Ntiyari koga cyane.
Your daughter.	Umukobwa wawe.
I have to.	Ngomba kugira.
I knew he had problems from the beginning.	Nari nzi ko afite ibibazo kuva mbere.
Yes, they were right.	Nibyo, bari bafite ukuri.
I desperately wanted something	Nashakaga cyane ikintu
Or for him.	Cyangwa kuri we.
I really didn't need it at the time	Ntabwo rwose nari nkeneye icyo gihe
I didn't think it would be good	Sinatekerezaga ko byaba byiza
You have to get this one !.	Ugomba kubona iyi!.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It's you.	Ndi wowe.
I can do it from here	Nshobora kubikora kuva hano
I did nothing wrong	Nta kibi nakoze
Maybe he bought it.	Birashoboka ko yaguze.
We had none.	Ntabwo twari dufite.
I hope we can be friends	Nizere ko dushobora kuba inshuti
You are looking for the truth.	Urimo gushaka ukuri.
I'm glad, in fact.	Nishimiye, mubyukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You know what they are.	Uzi icyo bari cyo.
I know they are out	Nzi ko bari hanze
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I wonder how long he has been here	Ndabaza igihe yamaze hano
A person has everything he needs	Umuntu afite ibyo akeneye byose
I think he is ready to take it	Ndatekereza ko yiteguye gufata
You were a believer.	Wari umuntu ashobora kwizera.
I didn't know what to say	Sinari nzi icyo avuga
Getting thinking.	Kubona gutekereza.
I never felt that it was true	Sinigeze numva ko ari ukuri
Too much money	Amafaranga menshi cyane
I'm sure you've seen it too.	Nzi neza ko nawe wabonye.
No play here.	Nta gukina hano.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I know it's good.	Nzi ko ari byiza.
It's a good day.	Ni umunsi mwiza.
I knew he had something to say.	Nari nzi ko afite icyo avuga.
It will not be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza.
Why or why.	Impamvu cyangwa kuki.
I just love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa gusa.
I feel, and I feel, and I feel.	Ndumva, kandi ndumva, kandi ndumva.
I can't find the truth	Sinshobora kubona ukuri
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byagenze neza.
I knew why he was here	Nari nzi impamvu yari hano
Everyone wants to do it.	Umuntu wese arashaka kubikora.
I need someone.	Nkeneye umuntu.
He was a friend.	Yari inshuti.
None of this works.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo akora.
We have one guy.	Dufite umusore umwe.
This one did well.	Uyu yakoze neza.
I never wanted to stay out	Sinigeze nshaka kuguma hanze
He just told the truth.	Yavuze ukuri gusa.
It was good to go.	Byari byiza kugenda.
We are a close family.	Turi umuryango wa hafi.
I have something good today	Mfite ikintu cyiza kuri uyu munsi
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi sibyo.
Never, in fact.	Nta na rimwe, mubyukuri.
I have a family.	Mfite umuryango.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He loves his family.	Akunda umuryango we.
I don't know if that's normal	Ntabwo nzi niba aribyo bisanzwe
I had both in my house	Nari mfite bombi mu nzu yanjye
And you want to stay, you want.	Kandi ushaka kuguma, urashaka.
The boy was here.	Umuhungu yari hano.
I am on the same issue	Nanjye ndi kuri icyo kibazo
But we don’t have this today.	Ariko ntabwo dufite iki gihe.
I have good friends.	Mfite inshuti nziza.
This will be fine.	Ibi bizaba byiza.
But he was scared.	Ariko yagize ubwoba.
He thought that was what he was expecting.	Yatekereje ko aribyo yari yiteze.
In fact, you should.	Mubyukuri, ugomba.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
It can't and can't be anything else.	Ntashobora kandi ntashobora kuba ikindi kintu.
I understand everything.	Ndumva byose.
I have never heard of this	Sinigeze numva ibi
It was not an easy task.	Ntabwo byari ibintu byoroshye.
I thought about going but it wasn’t	Natekereje kugenda ariko sibyo
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, cyane.
This is not me.	Uyu si njye.
He is here, man.	Ari hano, muntu.
I didn't have your gift	Ntabwo nari mfite impano yawe
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Nothing good.	Nta kintu cyiza.
I know what he wants	Nzi icyo ashaka
One thing at home.	Ikintu kimwe murugo.
His father can't work	Se ntashobora gukora
I know how to love good things	Nzi uburyo ukunda ibintu byiza
I didn't know what time it was	Sinari nzi igihe icyo aricyo
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Sinari nzi icyo yagiye gukora
I can walk for a long time alone	Nshobora kugenda igihe kirekire wenyine
I know what you said is true	Nzi ko ibyo wavuze ari ukuri
You are a good person.	Uri umuntu mwiza.
I can't get on the phone right now	Sinshobora kuza kuri terefone nonaha
My house was beautiful.	Inzu yanjye yari nziza.
I had the opportunity to make friends	Nagize amahirwe yo kugira inshuti
I haven't heard from him since	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze numva
I told no one	Nta muntu n'umwe nabwiye
But one has to go far.	Ariko umuntu agomba kujya kure.
I'm going to talk.	Ngiye kuvuga.
He went and went.	Yagiye kandi yagiye.
Kandi.	Kandi.
He didn't like the idea.	Ntabwo yari akunda igitekerezo.
Last thought.	Igitekerezo cya nyuma.
And there is a reason.	Kandi hariho impamvu.
He had an idea.	Yari afite igitekerezo.
Waiting on the phone.	Gutegereza kuri terefone.
I want to help.	Ndashaka gufasha.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I never wanted to be with him.	Sinigeze nshaka kubana na we.
He thought it was possible.	Yatekereje ko bishoboka.
Very bad time.	Igihe kibi cyane.
I have a small problem.	Mfite ikibazo gito.
I can't go now	Sinshobora kugenda nonaha
I really wasn't very good at it	Nukuri sinari mwiza cyane
Great time to eat	Igihe cyiza cyo kurya
You have to believe that you can really have it.	Ugomba kwizera ko ushobora kugira rwose.
He said someone was bad.	Yavuze ko hari umuntu mubi.
I know you have something to do with all of this	Nzi ko ufite icyo ukora kuri ibi byose
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
Niki, ni.	Niki, ni.
Getting things out of the way is easy.	Kubona ibintu byoroshye hanze.
He didn't have to do it.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubikora.
I knew he had the truth	Nari nzi ko afite ukuri
Women.	Akazi.
I mean, someone had to do it	Ndashaka kuvuga, umuntu yagombaga kubikora
Don't tell me.	Nta kumbwira.
I can't think of it right now	Ntabwo nshobora gutekereza kuri ubu
I heard nothing	Ntacyo numvise
I like the way he did it.	Nkunda uburyo yabikoze.
Most of the time they are behind.	Igihe kinini aba bari inyuma.
Work is work, and money is money	Akazi ni akazi, kandi amafaranga ni amafaranga
In fact, he never did.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yigeze abikora.
I didn't really know	Ntabwo nari nzi mubyukuri
He was not afraid, he could see.	Ntabwo yari ubwoba, yashoboraga kubona.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
I have never seen it before.	Sinigeze mbona mbere.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
Only I can believe	Ninjye wenyine ushobora kwizera
I can't take the time	Sinshobora gufata umwanya
He was in school alone.	Yari mu ishuri wenyine.
Not good to look at.	Ntabwo ari byiza kureba.
You are truly a gift.	Uri impano rwose.
I had little time to think	Nari mfite umwanya muto wo gutekereza
You are me.	Uri njye.
But sometimes it is possible.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.
I needed money	Nari nkeneye amafaranga
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
I don't think you can do it.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ushobora kubikora.
But there are a lot of people here.	Ariko hano hari abantu benshi.
I have little time to live with you	Mfite igihe gito cyo kubana nawe
He thought it was just normal.	Yatekereje ko ari ibintu bisanzwe gusa.
I have another problem	Mfite ikindi kibazo
I didn't get a chance to talk to you	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kuvugana nawe
It was not a problem at all.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo na kimwe.
Lots of opportunities.	Amahirwe menshi.
I think that's enough.	Ntekereza ko bihagije.
I know what he's going to do	Nzi icyo agiye gukora
This is probably not true.	Ibi birashoboka ko atari ukuri.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko ari.
I thought about it all	Natekereje kuri byose
He did very well.	Yakoze neza cyane.
I want to know why he went	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu yagiye
I need a plan.	Nkeneye gahunda.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I can't ask for more	Sinshobora gusaba byinshi
I need food.	Nkeneye ibiryo.
He can't speak.	Ntashobora kuvuga.
I never had time to think	Sinigeze mbona umwanya wo gutekereza
I didn’t know this, really	Sinari nzi ibi, rwose
I knew it was a problem	Nari nzi ko ari ibibazo
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
So much, so good.	Byinshi, byiza cyane.
Inside.	Imbere.
I'm sure there is more.	Nzi neza ko hari byinshi.
I'm not sure if that's the case	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aribyo
You don't have to do that.	Ntugomba kubikora.
I need to stay away from him	Nkeneye kuguma kure ye
She is beautiful	Niwe mwiza.
I don't know what he's doing here	Ntabwo nzi icyo akora hano
I can't think of anything else	Sinshobora gutekereza ikindi kintu
I also wanted to talk	Nanjye nashakaga kuvuga
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
I have to go to work tomorrow	Ngomba kujya ku kazi ejo
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He should have done that before.	Yari akwiye kubikora mbere.
I can be whatever you need.	Nshobora kuba icyo ukeneye cyose.
Ari.	Ari.
I had no room	Nta cyumba nari mfite
Something he feels.	Hari ikintu yumva.
We need everyone we can find.	Dukeneye abantu bose dushobora kubona.
I have a lot of money	Mfite amafaranga menshi
I want something.	Ndashaka ikintu.
You have an idea.	Ufite igitekerezo.
I'm glad you can do it.	Nishimiye ko ushobora kubikora.
It's not hard enough.	Ntabwo bigoye bihagije.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Or a problem, or what do you have.	Cyangwa ikibazo, cyangwa ufite iki.
I just wanted to go	Nashakaga gusa kugenda
I know there is a time to drive.	Nzi ko hari umwanya wo gutwara.
It would be for me.	Byaba kuri njye.
I really wanted to be	Nashakaga rwose kuba
I love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa.
I never heard of that.	Sinigeze numva ibyo.
John's money is close.	Amafaranga ya John hafi.
But he was not there.	Ariko ntiyari ahari.
Good guy good guy	Umusore mwiza, umusore mwiza
It was a great thing to say.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane kuvuga.
It looks bad.	Birasa nabi.
I needed to know that was all	Nari nkeneye kumenya ko aribyo byose
I was in.	Nari ndimo.
I wasn't going to do it	Ntabwo nari ngiye kubikora
He was just a family.	Yari umuryango gusa.
Everyone knows everyone here.	Abantu bose bazi abantu bose hano.
Can't you ?.	Ntushobora?.
I had nothing	Nta kintu na kimwe nari mfite
I want to see who he is	Ndashaka kureba uwo ari we
He wasn't sure if he wanted to go.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ashaka kujyana.
I like it easy.	Nkunda byoroshye.
I needed someone close	Nari nkeneye umuntu wo hafi
I didn’t think it would go away	Sinatekerezaga ko byari kugenda
It will not be.	Ntabwo bizaba.
I don't want to do that.	Ntashaka kubikora.
I knew what he meant	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga
Definitely a great buy so far.	Rwose kugura cyane kugeza ubu.
I thought it was normal	Natekereje ko byari bisanzwe
No one to play today	Nta muntu wo gukina uyu munsi
He thought about how happy he was.	Yatekereje uburyo yishimiye aho yari ari.
I don't know what to do now	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora ubu
He was not here.	Ntiyari hano.
I hope he knows something	Ndizera ko ashobora kumenya ikintu
He used to be outside.	Yakundaga kuba hanze.
He thought I should do something about it	Yatekereje ko ngomba kugira icyo nkora kuri ibi
I want to stay.	Ndashaka kuguma.
He is alone.	We wenyine.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
But not always.	Ariko si igihe cyose.
We have to see that	Tugomba kubona ibyo
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
I didn't think much of it	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
Maybe someone did it.	Birashoboka ko hari umuntu wabikoze.
I was not going now	Ntabwo nari ngiye ubu
I can't do this again	Ntabwo nshobora kongera gukora ibi
Maybe he should have.	Birashoboka ko yagombaga kugira.
We are all one, we are all one.	Twese turi umwe, turi umwe kuri bose.

I didn't really tell anyone	Ntabwo rwose nabwiye umuntu
This is a good boy.	Uyu ni umuhungu mwiza.

You can do whatever you want.	Urashobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He is ready.	Yiteguye hafi.
I don't want to do it again	Sinshaka kongera kubikora
In a short time no one saw it.	Mu gihe gito nta muntu yabonye.
But it looked good.	Ariko yasaga neza.
And there I am.	Kandi hariho njye.
At the same time, please.	Igihe kimwe, nyamuneka.
I like to drive.	Nkunda gutwara.
We were on the ground.	Twari hasi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I know what he wants to hear	Nzi icyo ashaka kumva
I never did anything	Nta kintu na kimwe nigeze nkora
I just want to make it work for everyone.	Gusa ndashaka gukora neza kuri buri wese.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
That's what his father can do.	Nibyo se ashobora gukora.
I would do a lot	Nari gukora byinshi
But for now, that's fine.	Ariko kuri ubu ibyo ni byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
I thought that was a good thing.	Natekereje ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
That would have been easier.	Ibyo byari kuba byoroshye.
I guess very little	Ndakeka gato cyane
I have a lot to do	Mfite byinshi byo gukora

He said you did it.	Yavuze ko wabikoze.
In fact, it is.	Mubyukuri, nibyo.
I can do nothing here	Ntacyo nshobora gukora hano
Down on him.	Hasi kuri we.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
I think below.	Ntekereza ko munsi.
It is beautiful hair.	Ni umusatsi mwiza.
I mean, a lot of things	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibintu byinshi
He went.	Yagiye.
He was here.	Hano yari.
I was the only one who was scared	Ninjye wenyine nagize ubwoba
I am your daughter.	Ndi umukobwa wawe.
I think it's a lot.	Ntekereza ko ari byinshi.
You have the opportunity to do just that.	Ufite amahirwe yo kugira ibyo.
I just want him to be a better person	Ndashaka ko aba umuntu mwiza gusa
I had nothing.	Ntacyo nari mfite.
I can let things go.	Nshobora kureka ibintu.

You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
Good girl!	Umukobwa mwiza!

But for each of us.	Ariko kuri buri wese muri twe.

He was lucky.	Yari afite amahirwe.
She is at home with her father.	Ari murugo hamwe na se.
I did what you wanted.	Nakoze ibyo ushaka.
He went to the day.	Yagiye ku munsi.
I have a lot of things for me	Mfite ibintu byinshi kuri njye
I'm afraid of being bad	Mfite ubwoba bwo kuba mubi
I have a long time	Mfite igihe kirekire
Clearly, a wise person needs to take action.	Biragaragara ko umuntu ufite ubwenge akeneye gufata ibintu.
I have my own plan	Mfite gahunda yanjye
Good plan to have.	Gahunda nziza yo kugira.
He knows nothing.	Nta cyo azi.
Can one know something ?.	Umuntu arashobora kumenya ikintu?.

I didn't see a problem with that	Ntabwo nabonye ikibazo kuri ibyo
I know how to do it	Nzi kubikora
You can try again later.	Urashobora kongera kugerageza nyuma.
But that was good enough.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza bihagije.

I just enjoy every morning.	Gusa nishimiye buri gitondo.
As he asked.	Nkuko yabajije.
For me it is all.	Kuri njye ni byose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.

I want to go tomorrow.	Ndashaka kugenda ejo.
I know this is difficult	Nzi ko ibi bigoye

It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I think it will be good	Ndatekereza ko bizaba byiza
I can't be here all the time	Sinshobora kuba hano igihe cyose

But, no.	Ariko, ntabwo.

You have nothing now.	Ubu ntacyo ufite.

But he went too far.	Ariko yagiye cyane.
This was a good thing.	Ibi byari ibintu byiza.
We have to.	Tugomba.
He knows what he's doing.	Azi ibyo akora.
It would be nice to think about this possible.	Bizaba byiza gutekereza kuri ibi bishoboka.

He saw exactly what he had to do.	Yabonye neza icyo yagombaga gukora.
I'm not thinking right now.	Ntabwo ndimo ntekereza kuri ubu.
I was afraid to do it	Nari mfite ubwoba bwo kubikora
And that's not really the case.	Kandi ntabwo aribyo rwose kugenda bigoye.
I have to know for sure.	Ngomba kumenya neza.
She is not my wife.	Ntabwo ari umugore wanjye.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
No one is here.	Nta muntu n'umwe uri hano.
I can't say enough good things	Sinshobora kuvuga ibintu byiza bihagije
.	.
I can ask for more, and	Nshobora gusaba byinshi, kandi
Maybe he can think with her.	Ahari arashobora gutekereza hamwe na we.
I wanted him to talk.	Nashakaga ko avuga.
I am very happy with the whole issue.	Nishimiye cyane ikibazo cyose.
I just know we were so close.	Gusa nzi ko twari hafi cyane.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
Maybe he thought we had a bad guy.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje ko dufite umusore mubi.
I can't see the problem.	Sinshobora kubona icyo kibazo.
It will not be easy.	Ntabwo bizaba hafi byoroshye.
I have an idea, but that's all	Mfite igitekerezo, ariko nibyo byose
I'm just happy to go.	Nishimiye gusa kugenda.
It is my house.	Ni inzu yanjye.
I hope everything is fine	Nizere ko byose ari byiza
I wanted to do it on my own	Nashakaga kubikora wenyine
I don’t even have to try	Ntabwo ngomba no kugerageza
But he knew it was there.	Ariko yari azi ko ahari.
I can walk very, very high	Nshobora kugenda cyane, hejuru cyane
I never felt like going.	Sinigeze numva nshaka kugenda.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
Now I feel something	Ubu ndumva ikintu
But this is not the case.	Ariko si iki kintu.
I didn’t need to know all this about him	Sinari nkeneye kumenya ibi byose kuri we
I don't want to stay here	Sinshaka kuguma hano
You can find something you like.	Urashobora kubona ikintu ukunda.
I knew the truth	Nari nzi ukuri
It was good though.	Byari byiza ariko.
But above all, he was a good man.	Ariko yari hejuru ya byose, yari umuntu mwiza.
I need to do it now	Nkeneye kubikora nonaha
I need to know a little bit	Nkeneye kumenya ikintu gito
I never had time to do this.	Sinigeze mbona umwanya wo gukora ibi.
Children are children.	Abana ni abana.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
And that is it.	Kandi icyo kintu ni.
I thought a lot about this.	Natekereje cyane kuri ibi.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
He needed that.	Yari akeneye ibyo.
And he was very worried.	Kandi yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
You have to tell me more.	Ugomba kumbwira byinshi.
BACK	NYUMA
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
We have a good plan.	Dufite gahunda nziza.
Especially for me.	Cyane cyane kuri njye.
And it's a lot.	Kandi ni byinshi.
He didn't tell me much.	Ntabwo yambwiye byinshi.
The human thing to say.	Ikintu cya muntu cyo kuvuga.
We have to say a lot.	Tugomba kuvuga byinshi.
.	.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
I hadn’t thought about this.	Sinari natekereje kuri ibi.
That is another problem.	Icyo ni ikindi kibazo.
In fact, it is.	Mubyukuri, nibyo.
To find a family now.	Kuri kubona umuryango nonaha.
I didn’t need to add to that.	Sinari nkeneye kongera kuri ibyo.
It's great here.	Nibyiza cyane hano.
He didn't have to do it.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubikora.
But you know what.	Ariko uzi icyo aricyo.
She likes to watch.	Akunda kureba.
This was ahead.	Ibi byari imbere.
He didn't even know how to do it.	Ntiyari azi no kubikora.
How is that possible?	Nigute bishoboka.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
No one expected it.	Nta n'umwe yari yiteze.
You can drive.	Urashobora gutwara.
I can live with that.	Nshobora kubana nibyo.
These are the things my family needs.	Ibi ni ibintu umuryango wanjye ukeneye.
You don't have to be here.	Ntugomba kuba hano.
Get to know it better.	Kumenya neza.
He wanted to speak well.	Yashakaga kuvuga neza.
He is a wise man.	Ni umuntu uzi ubwenge.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
I need a lot of time.	Nkeneye igihe kinini.
He wants to talk.	Ashaka kuvuga.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
It’s not a good time, when there’s a lot to do.	Ntabwo ari igihe cyiza, mugihe hari byinshi byo gukora.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza kandi kibi.
They knew how to wait, and how to eat.	Bari bazi gutegereza, no kurya.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You can't wait another time.	Ntushobora gutegereza ikindi gihe.
But now, here.	Ariko ubu, hano.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
She is a woman.	Ni umugore.
They are in this room, tonight.	Bari muri iki cyumba, muri iri joro.
Maybe we should have.	Birashoboka ko tugomba kugira.
Anyone could do anything.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I think that's a good idea.	Ntekereza ko icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
He is not a boy.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu.
You want to work.	Ushaka gukora.
Whether he knows that or not.	Yaba ibyo cyangwa ntacyo azi.
I'm too young to do that.	Ndi muto cyane kubikora.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona na rimwe.
I have had this problem all along.	Nagize iki kibazo igihe cyose.
Thank you so much, so much.	Nyamuneka byinshi, byinshi.
Ngomba.	Ngomba.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
It's great to be with you.	Ni mwiza cyane kubana nanjye.
They have a plan.	Bafite gahunda.
But he knew what a woman was.	Ariko yari azi icyo umugore aricyo.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva ntacyo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
The truth is.	Ukuri ni ukuri.
It was a party or something.	Byari ibirori cyangwa ikindi kintu.
He was not well prepared.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye neza.
You need to go.	Ukeneye kugenda.
Or none at all.	Cyangwa nta na kimwe.
I can't do things.	Sinshobora gukora ibintu.
You should have known better.	Wari ukwiye kumenya neza.
You can't see.	Ntushobora kubona.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
This is a gift.	Iyi ni impano.
Maybe here.	Ahari hano.
As below.	Nka hasi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Out here, you said, you're just friends.	Hanze hano, wavuze, uri inshuti gusa.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
Knowing how to play.	Kumenya gukina.
I love the baby.	Nkunda umwana.
He really has.	Afite rwose.
A beautiful, intelligent, beautiful girl.	Umukobwa mwiza, uzi ubwenge, mwiza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
In this room.	Muri iki cyumba.
That's a good thing.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
And this is obviously not good.	Kandi ibi biragaragara ko atari byiza.
It looks great right now.	Birasa neza cyane ubu.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
It’s the same idea.	Ni igitekerezo kimwe.
We can all win.	Twese dushobora gutsinda.
He picked up the phone.	Yafashe terefone.
I really don't know much about it.	Ntabwo rwose nzi byinshi kuri byo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ukuri nuko ugomba kumenya neza.
This is very bad.	Uyu ni mubi cyane.
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
You were right.	Wari ufite ukuri.
Looks like you know better.	Birasa nkaho uzi neza.
Here, here.	Hano, hano.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
But he had no money for her.	Ariko ntabwo yari afite amafaranga kuri we.
He was just one person.	Yari umuntu umwe gusa.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
They were many.	Bari benshi.
We have no.	Dufite ntabwo.
Everything was really good.	Byose byari byiza rwose.
He was just in her.	Yari muri we gusa.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I thought maybe.	Natekereje ahari.
It wasn't good here tonight.	Ntabwo byari byiza hano muri iri joro.
Good baby	Umwana mwiza.
Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
He is not anyone.	Ntabwo ari umuntu uwo ari we wese.
She feels good about him.	Yumva ari byiza kuri we.
A little thing.	Ikintu gito.
In.	Muri.
I thought he just loved the good stuff.	Natekerezaga ko akunda ibintu byiza gusa.
Probably they were.	Birashoboka ko bari.
It's all good for me.	Byose ni byiza kuri njye.
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
He has a lot to learn.	Afite byinshi byo kwiga.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
He must have gone for a really long time.	Agomba kuba yagiye igihe kinini rwose.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
This is not very difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye cyane.
When he was young	Igihe yari akiri muto.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
They don’t know exactly what it is now.	Ntabwo bazi neza icyo aricyo ubu.
Probably not.	Birashoboka, ntabwo ari rimwe.
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
If you need it, you should have it.	Ukeneye, ugomba kugira.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
He had to go.	Yari afite kugenda.
And in fact.	Kandi mu kuri.
It was on everything, upstairs.	Byari kuri buri kintu, hejuru.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Many in fact.	Benshi mubyukuri.
But he would not do it alone.	Ariko ntabwo yari kubikora wenyine.
I can't imagine who this would be.	Sinshobora gutekereza uwo ibi byaba byiza.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
That's not an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
She was his daughter.	Yari umukobwa we.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
But it's good to have.	Ariko ni byiza kugira.
I have no job.	Nta kazi mfite.
I never really felt it.	Sinigeze numva rwose.
Then there is no turning back.	Icyo gihe nta gusubira inyuma.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu.
He was a very good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza cyane.
I see it as true for me.	Mbona ari ukuri kuri njye.
He knew his place.	Yari azi umwanya we.
Or even victory.	Cyangwa no gutsinda.
But it is only possible.	Ariko birashoboka gusa.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
It's me for me.	Ni njye kuri njye.
Sometimes he is right.	Rimwe na rimwe aba afite ukuri.
We have to play well.	Tugomba gukina neza.
It was great to watch.	Byari byiza cyane kureba.
I knew he could see everything in me.	Nari nzi ko ashobora kubona ibintu byose muri njye.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
He never had problems.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ibibazo.
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
It is not very high.	Ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
I didn't hear about it.	Ntabwo numvise kuri njye.
Out here, please.	Hanze aha, nyamuneka.
I just didn't know it.	Gusa sinari nzi neza.
Glad he went.	Yishimiye ko yagiye.
Not just friends.	Ntabwo ari inshuti gusa.
For all he knew, that was it.	Kubyo yari azi byose, nibyo.
So far, he is not talking.	Kugeza ubu, ntabwo avuga.
Only one of us.	Gusa umwe muri twe.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
He thought it was good enough.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza bihagije.
I must be making a mistake.	Ngomba kuba nkora amakosa.
I thought it was great.	Natekereje ko ari byiza cyane.
My daughter is the only child.	Umukobwa wanjye ni umwana wenyine.
But it was normal.	Ariko byari bisanzwe.
This is a car.	Iyi ni imodoka.
That's not good.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
'	'
But there is so much to do.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo gukora.
You can't do it alone.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine.
Really a little.	Nukuri gato.
Sometimes you have to do it.	Rimwe na rimwe ugomba kubikora.
I can do absolutely nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora rwose.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I think that's exactly what we need right now.	Ntekereza ko aribyo rwose dukeneye ubu.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
He was looking bad.	Yashakaga nabi.
He wants to win.	Ashaka gutsinda.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora kuri ibyo.
Apparently he was.	Biragaragara ko yari.
I have this problem.	Mfite iki kibazo.
I feel like a little kid.	Numva ndi umwana muto.
He did not know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo yari kuvuga.
I think it’s a matter of looking.	Ntekereza ko ari ikibazo cyo kureba.
Eating at work.	Kurya ku kazi.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
To say	Kuvuga.
I think everyone knows when they are around.	Ntekereza ko abantu bose bazi iyo bari hafi.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Everyone.	Umuntu wese.
I like problems.	Nkunda ibibazo.
Good, good, and good.	Byiza, byiza, kandi byiza.
It was worse than that.	Yari mubi kuruta ibyo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He should not.	Ntabwo agomba.
What he does alone.	Ibyo akora wenyine.
I needed time.	Nari nkeneye igihe.
And it was really good.	Kandi byari byiza rwose.
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
That's not what he wanted.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga.
A woman could have done very badly.	Umugore yashoboraga gukora nabi cyane.
He has many friends.	Afite inshuti nyinshi.
I'm doing well now, in fact.	Ndimo gukora neza ubu, mubyukuri.
He did not have the opportunity to eat.	Ntabwo yari afite amahirwe yo kurya.
More than my son was my friend.	Kurenza umuhungu wanjye yari inshuti yanjye.
For me this is the case.	Kuri njye ibi nibyo.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
It was good, as it turned out.	Byari byiza, uko byagenze.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
Only, at that time his father was involved.	Gusa, icyo gihe se yari arimo.
You did it right.	Wabikoze neza.
There is a book.	Hariho igitabo.
They would not give up easily.	Ntabwo bari kureka byoroshye.
It won't be long.	Ntabwo bizaba igihe kirekire.
It’s not just the front.	Ntabwo ari imbere gusa.
But the problem is big.	Ariko ikibazo ni kinini.
He is the only one.	Ni we gusa.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He wanted out.	Yashakaga hanze.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
For a long time	Mu gihe kirekire.
One has to think.	Umuntu agomba gutekereza.
I don't have to go.	Ntabwo ngomba kugenda.
I have to go home.	Ngomba gutaha.
He must think that he is lucky.	Agomba gutekereza ko afite amahirwe.
He thought a lot about this film.	Yatekereje cyane kuri iyi firime.
It’s not something I like.	Ntabwo ari ikintu nkunda.
And that's exactly what he did.	Kandi ibyo ni byo yakoze.
He doesn’t do much.	Ntabwo akora cyane.
This is a great time to be.	Uyu ni umwanya mwiza wo kuba.
You can't ask for anything else.	Ntushobora gusaba ikindi kintu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I wanted to give up.	Nashakaga kureka.
I was in front of him.	Nari imbere ye.
He knew his wife.	Yari azi umugore we.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
And he was right about that.	Kandi yari afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
I have an early morning.	Mfite ejo kare.
That's not what you want.	Ntabwo aribyo ushaka.
He must be present.	Agomba kuba ahari.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
He used to talk about clothes.	Yakundaga kuvuga imyenda.
All day long	Umunsi wose.
Waiting for him to speak.	Gutegereza ko avuga.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
But this is only true.	Ariko ibi ni ukuri gusa.
You can only be alone.	Urashobora gusa kuba wenyine.
Good friends now	Inshuti nziza ubu.
We were so close to seeing that.	Twari hafi cyane kubona ibyo.
That's not really the case.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
He never did and never will.	Ntabwo yigeze agira kandi ntazigera abikora.
You may have time to travel now.	Urashobora kugira umwanya wawe wo kugenda nonaha.
All is well.	Byose byiza cyane.
What to do.	Icyo gukora.
That's where you said it.	Ni aho wavuze.
I should go back.	Nkwiye gusubira inyuma.
But he was not a child.	Ariko ntabwo yari umwana.
.	.
He wanted to speak again.	Yashakaga kongera kuvuga.
He was everyone's friend.	Yari inshuti ya buri muntu.
He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kugenda.
You are a young man.	Uri umusore.
Why? 	Kuki?
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He should not have heard of this, not of him.	Ntagomba kumva ibi, atari kuri we.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
Whether this is true or not is not a problem.	Niba ibi ari ukuri cyangwa atari byo, ntabwo ari ikibazo.
He had it all.	Yari afite byose.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He looked inside.	Yarebye imbere muri yo.
Who? 	Ninde?
But we are too.	Ariko natwe turi.
It's a privilege.	Ni amahirwe.
But he was very close.	Ariko yari hafi cyane.
But advice would be a good time.	Ariko inama yaba umwanya mwiza.
, To do.	, Kuri Gukora.
He was.	Yari we.
My wife does not want a child.	Umugore wanjye ntashaka umwana.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
That's easy.	Nibyo byoroshye.
Is it okay?	Nibyiza?.
He had his own problems.	Yari afite ibibazo wenyine.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Friends.	Inshuti.
But he didn't want to hear it.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kumva.
I am always there.	Buri gihe ndi njye.
All is well.	Byose nibyiza.
Ask for help.	Gusaba ubufasha.
You probably know why.	Birashoboka ko uzi impamvu.
I don't want problems.	Sinshaka ibibazo.
It was a long time.	Byari igihe kinini.
There is something here.	Hano hari ikintu.
He is a young man.	Ni umusore.
He could do anything.	Yashoboraga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu cyo kuvuga.
We have to do it now.	Tugomba kubikora ubu.
But then at that time.	Ariko icyo gihe icyo gihe.
I saw.	Nabonye.
You need hair.	Ukeneye umusatsi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibintu byose byari byoroshye kandi bigoye.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
The child had problems.	Umwana yari afite ibibazo.
This would be a problem.	Ibi byaba ari ikibazo.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
I know he is right.	Nzi ko avuga ukuri.
She loves this movie.	Akunda iyi firime.
This, so far, is probably my favorite.	Ibi, kugeza ubu, birashoboka ko nkunda.
For one of them.	Kuri kimwe muri byo.
But that was exactly what he expected.	Ariko byari ibyo yari yiteze.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
Dog.	Imbwa.
He has no one.	Nta muntu afite.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He had.	Yari afite.
I had a reason.	Nari mfite impamvu.
It will be.	Bizaba.
Everything you need to know.	Ikintu cyose ukeneye kumenya.
We weren’t many of us.	Ntabwo twari benshi muri twe.
This is not your advice.	Iyi ntabwo ari inama yawe.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
And someone did it.	Kandi hari umuntu wabikoze.
You need to go ahead.	Ukeneye kujya imbere.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I understand this.	Numva ibi.
To see	Kureba.
Very good book.	Igitabo cyiza cyane.
I needed to see.	Nari nkeneye kubona.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba hano.
He chose.	Yahisemo.
That person is just bad.	Uwo muntu ni mubi gusa.
It was on me.	Yari kuri njye.
You were a young child.	Wari umwana muto.
But the reason for being good is not good.	Ariko impamvu yo kuba nziza ntabwo iri nziza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko we na we.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I should have thought.	Nari nkwiye gutekereza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Everything was down.	Ibintu byose byari hasi.
Maybe it would have been a little better upstairs.	Birashoboka ko byari kuba byiza gato hejuru.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
I don't need help.	Ntabwo nkeneye ubufasha.
He is not one now.	Ntabwo ari umwe ubu.
I don't like children.	Ntabwo nkunda abana.
One has to do it.	Umuntu agomba kubikora.
Or trying to be.	Cyangwa kugerageza kuba.
That's good! 	Nibyiza!
I think he is close to everyone.	Ndatekereza ko ari hafi ya bose.
There is no one behind me.	Nta muntu uri inyuma yanjye.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
Fear is real.	Ubwoba ni ukuri.
Just you and me.	Gusa wowe na njye.
I don't know if this is true or not.	Sinzi niba ibi ari ukuri cyangwa atari byo.
I just enjoyed everything here.	Gusa nishimiye ibintu byose hano.
All the same.	Byose kimwe.
He looked closely at her.	Yarebye neza muri we.
Anyone can.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese arashobora.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
'	'
I needed to know.	Nari nkeneye kumenya.
But he had to say that.	Ariko yagombaga kuvuga ibyo.
But obviously not good.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari byiza.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
He did not want to do that.	Ntiyashakaga kubikora.
It was not a big deal.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo kinini.
He also speaks well.	Avuga kandi neza.
This is it.	Ni iyi.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
You have to go see someone.	Ugomba kujya kureba umuntu.
But you saw it for a while.	Ariko wabonye igihe gito.
I thought it was really good.	Natekereje ko byari byiza rwose.
He has it now.	Afite ubu.
It was good when I was alone.	Byari byiza mugihe hari njye gusa.
Read more.	Gusoma byinshi.
And they had.	Kandi bari bafite.
All of this is obvious.	Ibi byose biragaragara.
It is not wise.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge.
He needed money.	Yari akeneye amafaranga.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
Three years.	Imyaka itatu.
I think it's good for her.	Ntekereza ko ari mwiza kuri we.
He asked.	Yabajije.
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It would be a small family.	Byaba umuryango muto.
And that is money.	Kandi ibyo ni amafaranga.
Not good enough.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Nzi neza ko atari byo.
Everyone is very close.	Umuntu wese abana hafi cyane.
More than trying to solve a problem.	Kurenza kugerageza ikibazo.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
In fact, there is only one person here.	Mubyukuri, hano hari umuntu umwe gusa.
You have a problem.	Niwowe ufite ikibazo.
He took the first step.	Yafashe ikintu cya mbere.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He can't work.	Ntashobora gukora.
And that's a good thing.	Kandi icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
No need to do it again.	Nta mpamvu yo kongera kubikora.
She loves dogs.	Akunda imbwa.
I didn’t have time to be a kid.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kuba umwana.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We have to go fast.	Tugomba kugenda vuba.
Or Or, Or Or.	Cyangwa Cyangwa, Cyangwa Cyangwa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
We are where we are.	Turi aho turi.
Here, things are similar.	Hano, ibintu birasa.
I know it's not my fault.	Nzi ko atari amakosa yanjye.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
I want to go again.	Ndashaka kongera kugenda.
He didn't do it then, he doesn't do it now.	Ntabwo yakoze icyo gihe, ntabwo akora ubu.
He had to do something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo akora.
I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko aricyo kintu cyiza yakoze.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
It's not tonight.	Ntabwo ari iri joro.
Something in that, maybe.	Ikintu muri ibyo, birashoboka.
Uri.	Uri.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
But it was very difficult.	Ariko byari bigoye cyane.
I have a house.	Mfite inzu.
Lots.	Byinshi.
But not us.	Ariko ntabwo ari twe.
There is a lot of food to think about here.	Hano hari ibiryo byinshi byo gutekereza.
No one knew what he was talking about.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi icyo avuga.
But I can't do that.	Ariko sinshobora kubikora.
He can live again.	Arashobora kongera kubaho.
I tell you the truth.	Mbwira ko atari ukuri.
I have to go home.	Ngomba gutaha.
It looks good.	Birasa naho ari byiza.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Maybe we all had that in us.	Birashoboka ko twese twari dufite ibyo muri twe.
I didn’t like it very much, in fact.	Sinigeze nkunda cyane, mubyukuri.
Another good thing about it.	Ikindi kintu cyiza kuri byo.
I love my new home.	Nkunda inzu yanjye nshya.
This is it.	Ubu ni bwo.
Really, really, one by one.	Nukuri, mubyukuri, umwe kandi umwe.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
That's right.	Ibyo aribyo.
No one knew for sure why.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi neza impamvu.
And to go.	Kandi kugenda.
I'm sure there is.	Nzi neza ko ahari.
He thought all day.	Yatekerezaga umunsi wose.
I would do it.	Nari kubikora.
That's what you do.	Nibyo ukora.
I'm not sure the problem.	Sinzi neza ikibazo.
There is something very wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi cyane.
We are not.	Ntabwo turi.
But we weren't here.	Ariko twe kuba hano ntabwo twari.
Come on.	Hasi.
But most people.	Ariko abantu benshi.
He came to help.	Yaje gufasha.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
That is not the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
This is what you mean to me.	Ibi nibyo ushaka kuvuga kuri njye.
I think it worked for everyone.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza kuri buri wese.
I can do it now.	Nshobora kubikora ubu.
And she was a woman.	Kandi yari umugore.
For more.	Kuri byinshi.
One of us.	Umwe muri twe.
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
I don't think it's good.	Ntabwo mbona ko ari byiza.
No, obviously.	Ntabwo aribyo, biragaragara.
They were in school.	Bari mwishuri.
But he didn't want to buy anything.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga kugura.
He did not come.	Ntabwo yaje.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
You can't do it right.	Ntushobora kubikora neza.
Someone has heard of this.	Hari umuntu wigeze yumva ibi.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
This is what I saw.	Ibi nibyo nabonye.
It's good that we can do something right.	Nibyiza ko dushobora gukora ikintu neza.
He was a good dog.	Yari imbwa nziza.
It’s not the same thing at all.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe rwose.
He did nothing.	Ntiyigeze agira icyo akora.
And you don’t have to.	Kandi ntugomba.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
But all is well.	Ariko byose ni byiza.
It's great outside.	Nibyiza cyane hanze.
But obviously not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari byo.
Bad wife	Umugore mubi.
He did not know how.	Ntiyari azi uburyo.
I guess that's why.	Ndakeka ko iyi ari yo mpamvu.
It's about something.	Ni Kuri Ikintu.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
I know it's me.	Nzi ko ari njye.
Or a child.	Cyangwa umwana.
Apparently he thought he couldn't, so he left.	Biragaragara ko yatekereje ko adashobora, nuko yagiye.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
I'm thinking of everything.	Ndimo ntekereza ibintu byose.
It was as if he was doing time.	Byari nkaho akora igihe.
No one was worried.	Nta muntu wari ufite impungenge.
This is a very good thing.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza cyane.
It wasn't something he thought.	Ntabwo yari ikintu yatekerezaga.
I don't need to know anything else.	Ntabwo nkeneye kumenya ikindi kintu.
He hopes so.	Yizeye ko aribyo.
I have to do well.	Ngomba gukora neza.
It is and is not.	Ari kandi ntabwo aribyo.
No plans.	Nta gahunda.
He says wait.	Avuga ko gutegereza.
He was not sitting in front of her.	Ntiyari yicaye imbere ye.
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
I don't believe anyone.	Nta muntu nizera.
There is a lot to carry.	Hariho byinshi byo gutwara.
They were very good friends.	Bari inshuti nziza cyane.
But it was true.	Ariko byari ukuri.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
What he meant.	Icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
He would not take my money.	Ntabwo yari gutwara amafaranga yanjye.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko mubyukuri aribyo.
I should have been.	Nari nkwiye kuba.
Much better than me.	Byinshi kundusha.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while.	Nashakaga kuba wenyine nawe igihe gito.
But he was.	Ariko yari.
I was inside.	Nari imbere.
But we.	Ariko twe.
I'm not here.	Ntabwo ndi hano.
Fear is an idea.	Ubwoba ni igitekerezo.
And he was gone.	Kandi yari yagiye.
But later.	Nyuma ariko.
He just knew he needed it.	Yari azi gusa ko akeneye.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo gito.
He needed food.	Yari akeneye ibiryo.
That's good for me !.	Nibyiza kuri njye!.
Car.	Imodoka.
She was not beautiful, she was not at home.	Ntabwo yari mwiza, ntabwo yari murugo.
You can't help being alone.	Ntushobora gufasha kuba wenyine.
You don’t have to eat everything.	Ntugomba kurya byose.
It was very, very fast.	Byari byinshi cyane, vuba cyane.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I think he got the idea.	Ndatekereza ko yabonye igitekerezo.
And it's not hard to do.	Kandi ntabwo bigoye kubikora.
Everyone knows that is true.	Abantu bose bazi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
I have people.	Mfite abantu.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
But that was not the case.	Ariko iyo ntiyari yo mpamvu.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
I know he did.	Nzi ko yabikoze.
It's small.	Ni muto.
I can't think of a reason.	Sinshobora gutekereza impamvu.
I like one.	Nkunda umwe.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
And he was.	Kandi yari.
He was right.	Yavuze neza nabi.
I'm happy with everything.	Nishimiye byose.
On that issue.	Kuri icyo kibazo.
You can't work.	Ntushobora gukora.
I have to look the same.	Ngomba kureba kimwe.
Apparently he was looking for someone.	Biragaragara ko yashakaga umuntu.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
That would have been difficult.	Ibyo byari kuba bigoye.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He said this.	Yavuze ibi.
None of this here.	Nta na kimwe muri byo hano.
But not many.	Ariko si benshi.
I am very happy to see this.	Nishimiye cyane kubona ibi.
I did wrong.	Nakoze nabi.
Behind.	Inyuma.
You want and want to stay in.	Urashaka kandi ushaka kuguma muri.
He says he has a plan for everything.	Avuga ko afite gahunda kuri buri kintu.
I overheard him talking on the phone.	Numvise avuga kuri terefone.
Inside.	Imbere.
Getting an idea.	Kubona igitekerezo.
They probably knew my family.	Birashoboka ko bari bazi umuryango wanjye.
He has problems.	Afite ibibazo.
It’s best to do something you love every day.	Nibyiza gukora ikintu ukunda buri munsi.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
I'm glad he did well.	Nishimiye ko yakoze neza.
Just you	Wowe gusa.
This was a lot to take.	Ibi byari byinshi byo gufata.
That would be great.	Ibyo byaba byiza cyane.
I was not close.	Ntabwo nari hafi.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
It was easy to wait.	Byari byoroshye gutegereza.
I'm sure it was good.	Nzi neza ko byari byiza.
You can have it.	Urashobora kugira.
That's right, but you have to be realistic.	Nibyo, ariko ugomba kuba mubyukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
A lot of things are obvious.	Ibintu byinshi biragaragara.
He had a reason.	Yari afite impamvu.
Let it go.	Kureka, reka.
But he had to come.	Ariko yari afite kuza.
I need to have what you have.	Nkeneye kugira ibyo ufite.
You know what it is.	Uzi icyo ari cyo.
But he was not at home.	Ariko ntabwo yari murugo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo rwose ntabwo aribyo.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
And if he was there.	Niba kandi yari ahari.
But most of all.	Ariko cyane cyane.
You are who you are.	Uri uwo uri we.
He wanted his father.	Yashakaga se.
He has a job.	Afite akazi.
But we may have time for the same.	Ariko dushobora kuba dufite umwanya wa kimwe.
I'm not a bad guy.	Ntabwo ndi umusore mubi.
What to do, what to do.	Icyo gukora, icyo gukora.
He knew he looked good.	Yari azi ko asa neza.
That's great. 	Nibyiza cyane.
'	'
He is a young boy.	Ni umuhungu muto.
You can't see anything.	Ntushobora kubona ikintu.
She used to have her own family.	Yakundaga kugira umuryango we.
Whatever we need.	Icyo dukeneye cyose.
He finally asked the question.	Amaherezo yabajije ikibazo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He had no one to talk to.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari afite wo kuvugana.
Maybe no one did it.	Ahari nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
You are a woman.	Uri umugore.
Whatever it is, it will happen.	Ibyo ari byo byose bizaba, bizaba.
He was never there.	Ntiyigeze aho ari.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kubikora.
You have to do this on your own.	Ibi ugomba gukora wenyine.
He is very young.	Ari muto cyane.
People are people.	Abantu ni abantu.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
To drink	Kunywa.
I'm here now.	Ndi hano ubu.
But he can have it.	Ariko arashobora kugira.
He wanted to talk to you very badly.	Yashakaga kuvugana nawe nabi cyane.
But no one said.	Ariko nta muntu wavuze.
One question, one idea.	Ikibazo kimwe, igitekerezo.
This was a gift.	Iyi yari impano.
One but not the same.	Kimwe ariko ntabwo ari kimwe.
I mean, a lot.	Ndashaka kuvuga, byinshi.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
He will be here soon.	Azaba hano vuba.
Everything.	Byose.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
I can't live without it.	Sinshobora kubaho muri ibyo.
The guy.	Umusore.
Dogs are not humans.	Imbwa ntabwo ari abantu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
This room is not good.	Iki cyumba ntabwo ari cyiza.
He thought that was a good idea.	Yatekereje ko icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
He is for me.	Niwe kuri njye.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
I can't do this.	Ibi ntashobora gukora.
I hope it is the same for everyone.	Nizera ko ari kimwe kuri buri wese.
Everything you need	Ibyo ukeneye byose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I'm glad he did.	Nishimiye ko yabikoze.
And I can't figure out why.	Kandi sinshobora kumenya impamvu aribyo.
It's early.	Ubu ndi kare.
That's right.	Nibyiza nibyo.
I just want to work.	Gusa ndashaka gukora akazi.
We have a lot now.	Ubu dufite byinshi.
They had no plans.	Nta gahunda bari bafite.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
And that's probably the case.	Kandi birashoboka ko aribyo.
That would be a mistake.	Ibyo byaba ari amakosa.
I knew it then.	Nari nzi icyo gihe.
I'm sure this will be fine.	Nzi neza ko ibi bizaba byiza.
I never could.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora.
He was not very good.	Ntabwo yari mwiza cyane.
He may not be able to talk to you.	Birashoboka ko adashobora kuvugana nawe.
It's not a job.	Ntabwo ari akazi.
He had nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite cyo kuvuga.
He took that thing.	Yafashe icyo kintu.
True to many.	Nukuri kuri benshi.
After thinking for a while, he realized why.	Amaze gutekereza gato, yamenye impamvu.
But at the time, I didn't think much of it.	Ariko icyo gihe ntacyo natekereje.
It was very difficult, man.	Byari bigoye cyane, muntu.
You have to get out of here.	Ugomba kuva hano.
I should have known better.	Nari nkwiye kumenya neza.
Dear Sir, This is good.	Nyamuneka, ibi nibyiza.
It's not a big deal, but it's really small.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini, ariko rwose ni gito.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
I'm glad they're finally home.	Nishimiye ko amaherezo bari murugo.
They knew it was true.	Bari bazi ko aribyo.
Nowhere.	Nta na hamwe.
I knew this.	Nari nzi ibi.
The woman is here.	Umugore ari hano.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
He wanted to do well.	Yashakaga gukora neza.
You are now.	Ubu uri.
I just do it.	Nkora gusa.
Really bad idea.	Mubyukuri igitekerezo kibi.
Shame, good.	Isoni, nziza.
Probably not tomorrow.	Birashoboka ko atari ejo.
He went.	Yagiye.
Sometimes it was very difficult.	Rimwe na rimwe byari bigoye cyane.
They had it all.	Bari bafite byose.
Until he said what he said.	Kugeza igihe yavuze ibyo yavuze.
Niki.	Niki.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka cyane muri iki gihe.
And we were so close to being a big, good thing.	Kandi twari hafi cyane yo kuba ikintu kinini, ikintu cyiza.
He also wanted to.	Yashakaga kandi.
You have your time.	Ufite umwanya wawe.
No one can say.	Nta muntu ushobora kuvuga.
She looked so beautiful.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza cyane.
He was not going to do it.	Ntabwo yari agiye kubikora.
Larger than a book.	Kinini kuruta igitabo.
I heard someone can help.	Numvise umuntu ushobora gufasha.
I can't do that.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora gutya.
I can do a lot with that.	Nshobora gukora byinshi hamwe nibyo.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He is here.	Ari hano.
He said nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yavuze.
I don't know what he does.	Ntabwo nzi icyo akora.
In this house.	Muri iyi nzu.
I hope it worked out.	Ndizera ko byagenze neza.
It's not a movie.	Ntabwo ari firime.
His daughter.	Umukobwa we.
They were far away.	Bari kure.
We have to work hard.	Tugomba gukora cyane.
I thought that was the best thing he had.	Natekereje ko aricyo kintu cyiza yari afite.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I just think. 	Ndatekereza gusa.
'	'
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
He thought it was wrong.	Yatekereje ko atari byo.
Well, we need to play better.	Nibyo, dukeneye gukina neza.
This is the place.	Ibi ni.
But he needed more.	Ariko yari akeneye byinshi.
That's right.	Iki ni cyo.
None of us have to do that.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ugomba kubikora.
You were in it.	Wari urimo.
Or early in the morning.	Cyangwa kare mu gitondo.
They didn’t have much.	Ntabwo bari bafite byinshi.
For him, he is the only one.	Kuri we, ni we wenyine.
Money is time.	Amafaranga ni igihe.
But I'm glad this time, really.	Ariko nishimiye iki gihe, rwose.
Let this go.	Reka ibi.
I know how to drive.	Nzi gutwara.
I wonder why this is.	Ndabaza impamvu ibi.
And not much time.	Kandi nta gihe kinini.
Tell me now.	Mbwira nonaha.
I don't know a woman.	Ntabwo nzi umugore.
He is a good child.	Ni umwana mwiza.
We have to play well.	Tugomba gukina neza.
I know where they are at home.	Nzi aho bari murugo.

But for now we have to go.	Ariko kuri ubu tugomba kugenda.
You have to.	Ugomba.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Kuruta imbwa.
I want to learn more.	Ndashaka kwiga byinshi.
Or maybe at all times.	Cyangwa ahari igihe cyose.
He had to think.	Yagombaga gutekereza.
He did not know exactly who he was.	Ntabwo yari azi neza uwo ari we.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
He seemed unaware of it.	Yasaga naho atazi neza.
You don't know what to do.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo gukora.
This is a real thing.	Iki ni ikintu rwose.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
I am the only person.	Ninjye muntu wenyine.
I want to read what he says.	Ndashaka gusoma icyo avuga.
When you see it, you see it.	Iyo wabonye, ​​wabonye.
I was just lucky.	Nagize amahirwe gusa.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
And when there is no turning back, you can move forward.	Kandi mugihe nta gusubira inyuma, urashobora kujya imbere.

Please let go.	Nyamuneka reka.
It was great here.	Hano byari byiza.
I know for sure.	Nzi neza.
That's not what he wanted.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga.
There is a child here.	Hano hari umwana.
This is really good.	Ibi rwose ni byiza.
I want him to say.	Ndashaka ko avuga.
You are going to ask for money.	Ugiye gusaba amafaranga.
It's a privilege.	Ni amahirwe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
The reason you said you have good things.	Impamvu wavuze ko ufite ibintu byiza.
It will not be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza.
Maybe down.	Ahari hasi.
But only once.	Ariko rimwe gusa.
I can't help it.	Sinshobora gufasha.
He says he has to talk to me.	Avuga ko agomba kuvugana nanjye.
People, not much.	Abantu, si byinshi.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
Everyone is very kind.	Umuntu wese agira neza cyane.
I would go far.	Nari kujya kure.
One of us.	Umwe muri twe.
He chose to tell me his advice.	Yahisemo kumbwira inama ye.
There is truth in truth.	Hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
Favorite food	Ibiryo akunda.
Someone was in the house.	Umuntu yari mu nzu.
But there is no reason to do this.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo gukora ibi.
He is anyone.	Ni umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It would not be during the meal.	Ntabwo yari kuba mugihe cyo kurya.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo aribyo rwose, biragaragara.
I know where you're going.	Nzi iyo ugiye.
One could do something, maybe.	Umuntu yashoboraga kugira icyo akora, birashoboka.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
That was a good movie.	Iyo yari firime nziza.
I think this is a good movie.	Ntekereza ko iyi ari firime nziza.
I saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe nabonye.
He was sitting there.	Yari yicaye aho.
She was a girl.	Yari umukobwa.
We don't have time to do that.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya wo kubikora.
You are not here.	Ntabwo uri hano.
I have to stop working.	Ngomba guhagarika gukora.
It's something you have to live with.	Ni ikintu ugomba kubana.
He never thought it was a job.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ko ari akazi.
But in reality, this was good.	Ariko, mubyukuri, ibi byari byiza.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
We really needed it.	Twari dukeneye rwose.
But he didn't need to.	Ariko ntiyari akeneye.
How he looked.	Uburyo yasaga.
Money, money, money.	Amafaranga, amafaranga, amafaranga.

It's you	Ni wowe.
They were human.	Bari abantu.
He knew what he needed.	Yari azi icyo yari akeneye.
He is young to her.	Ari muto kuri we.
But that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
Everything is true.	Byose ni ukuri.
I think that's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko icyo ari ikintu cyiza.
And he was not happy with what he saw.	Kandi ntabwo yishimiye ibyo yabonye.
This is not a plan.	Iyi ntabwo ari gahunda.
He is a good child.	Ni umwana mwiza.
I'm not a girl.	Ntabwo ndi umukobwa.
This is his first meeting.	Iyi ni yo nama ye ya mbere.
He said to do it together.	Yavuze kubikora hamwe.
That is not easy.	Ibyo ntabwo byoroshye.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
I never heard of that.	Sinigeze numva icyo kibazo.
What you think you should do.	Ibyo utekereza ko ugomba gukora.
And they were right.	Kandi bari bafite ukuri.
He went.	Yagiye.
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
We are close.	Turi hafi.
At the time, he didn't want to.	Icyo gihe ntiyashakaga.
This is really good.	Ibi ni byiza rwose.
His first thought was frightened.	Igitekerezo cye cya mbere yari afite ubwoba.
Maybe it was an opportunity.	Ahari byari amahirwe.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
That is a gift.	Iyo ni impano.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
If.	Niba.
He must want to win.	Agomba gushaka gutsinda.
He was dressed.	Yari yambaye.
I have something.	Mfite ikintu.
From above.	Kuva hejuru.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
No one is around tonight.	Nta muntu uri hafi muri iri joro.
He meant that.	Yashakaga kuvuga ko.
Just one question.	Ikibazo kimwe gusa.
One good thing.	Ikintu kimwe cyiza.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
I thought I was a friend too.	Natekerezaga ko njye na njye turi inshuti.
But I knew I needed to watch.	Ariko nari nzi ko nkeneye kureba.
He took it every day.	Aba yafashe buri munsi ku munsi.
But for him it is not.	Ariko kuri we sibyo.
He did not know why.	Ntiyari azi impamvu.
Obviously, you are a young man.	Biragaragara, uri umusore.
I don't think he has.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko afite.
Long time to eat.	Igihe kirekire cyo kurya.
There is a woman.	Hariho umugore.
He was the only one who ever had.	Niwe wenyine wigeze agira.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
Now everything is fine.	Ubu ibintu byose byagenze neza.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
But that was not all.	Ariko ntabwo byari byose.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
That's right.	Nukuri.
But the same idea.	Ariko igitekerezo kimwe.
I know it's not easy.	Nzi ko atari ibintu byoroshye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibyo aribyo byose.
He said he had something in mind.	Yavuze ko hari icyo atekereza.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
He is not a bad person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mubi.
My luck.	Amahirwe yanjye.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I got a little better.	Nabonye neza gato.
I should have had a job.	Nari nkwiye kugira akazi.
He said nothing about it.	Nta cyo yavuze kuri ibyo.
He has one daughter.	Afite umukobwa umwe.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
It came easily.	Yaje byoroshye.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I know you did.	Nzi ko wabikoze.
He has not been alone in this house ever since.	Kuva icyo gihe ntabwo yigeze aba wenyine muri iyi nzu.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
You need a gift.	Ukeneye impano.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
I think he's right, he never had a chance.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri, ntabwo yigeze agira amahirwe.
In the worst case scenario.	Mugihe kibi cyane.
No one had a say.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite icyo avuga.
I'm just thinking about myself really.	Gusa ndimo ntekereza kuri njye mubyukuri.
And it was.	Kandi byari.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
Just not a single woman.	Gusa ntabwo ari umugore umwe.
I have my own house.	Mfite inzu yanjye.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
He has to do it.	Agomba kubikora.
As he should.	Nkuko agomba.
Outside.	Hanze.
He was looking for money.	Yashakaga amafaranga.
From the house.	Kuva mu nzu.
You don't have to be here.	Ntagomba kuba hano.
I saw this.	Nabonye ibi.
He had a place to live.	Yari afite aho agomba kuba.
Apparently I felt bad.	Biragaragara ko numvise nabi.
As if he couldn't be out of here.	Nkaho adashobora kuba bishoboka kuva hano.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ndi hano.
House.	Inzu.
He didn't find anything easy.	Ntacyo yabonye byoroshye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
They have before and they have after.	Bafite mbere kandi bafite nyuma.
I think the more you do, the better.	Ntekereza ko uko ukora byinshi, ari byiza.
But not here.	Ariko ntabwo ari hano.
Eventually, he chose.	Amaherezo, yahisemo.
It's too young.	Ndi muto.
He was still very far away.	Yari akiri kure cyane.
I was scared.	Numvise ubwoba.
We have to play well.	Tugomba gukina neza.
Every day.	Buri munsi.
He did it very badly.	Yabikoze nabi cyane.
I was the only person in the room.	Nari umuntu wenyine mu cyumba.
But you can try.	Ariko urashobora kugerageza.
Up, up and away.	Hejuru, hejuru no kure.
From the good.	Kuva ku byiza.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
There is a child.	Hariho umwana.
Let go of your money.	Kureka amafaranga yawe.
That's right- this is not about us.	Nibyo, ntidushobora rwose.
I mean, well.	Ndashaka kuvuga, neza.
But in the short term.	Ariko mu gihe gito.
I knew it was now or never.	Nari nzi ko ari ubu cyangwa nta na rimwe.
He knew there was a problem.	Yari azi ko hari ikibazo.
It was a lot for many.	Byari byinshi kuri benshi.
That was a great day.	Uwo wari umunsi mwiza.
I love dogs so much.	Nkunda imbwa cyane.
We can't do this.	Ntidushobora gukora ibi.
All of this is my fault.	Ibi byose ni amakosa yanjye.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, rwose.
For him it was a lot for him.	Kuri we byari byinshi kuri we.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
But he.	Ariko we.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
It started.	Yatangiye.
That, too, was a good thing.	Ibyo na byo byari ibintu byiza.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
If not today, tomorrow.	Niba atari uyu munsi, ejo.
I was too.	Nanjye nari njye.
Any idea.	Igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
He was the same.	Na we ni ko yari.
Very good book.	Igitabo cyiza cyane.
It would be nice if he did.	Byari byiza ko abikora.
But I guess.	Ariko ndakeka yuko.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
You were right.	Wari ukuri.
I don't want or need your money.	Sinshaka cyangwa nkeneye amafaranga yawe.
She did a great job, and it was a great day.	Yakoze gufata neza, kandi wari umunsi mwiza.
She loved to read.	Yakundaga gusoma.
You need more.	Ukeneye byinshi.
By now, everyone knew why.	Kugeza ubu, abantu bose bari bazi impamvu.
I don't feel good about myself.	Ntabwo numva ari byiza kuri njye.
However, she is a young child and is her teacher.	Ariko, ni umwana muto kandi uri umwarimu we.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, hari ibintu byiza rwose.
This, however, is not the norm.	Ibi ariko, ntabwo aribyo bisanzwe.
But he doesn't seem to have done it.	Ariko ntabwo asa nkaho yigeze abikora.
It's a problem for him.	Ni ikibazo kuri we.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo gito.
Is this true ?.	Ibi nibyo?.
This is a great day for me.	Uyu ni umunsi mwiza kuri njye.
I want something small.	Ndashaka ikintu gito.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
And to say the least, it's obvious.	Kandi kuvuga, biragaragara.
But everything went well.	Ariko ibintu byose byagenze neza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's the same.	Ni kimwe.
Big question.	Ikibazo kinini.
He was no longer human.	Ntiyari akiri umuntu.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
I don't know what it is.	Sinzi iyo ari yo.
I have a good idea.	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza.
Everyone needs their time.	Umuntu wese akeneye igihe cye.
In that case,.	Icyo gihe,.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
Reading fast is good.	Gusoma vuba ni byiza.
I don’t know where he is or what he does.	Sinzi aho ari cyangwa icyo akora.
He didn't do it, in fact he didn't.	Ntabwo yabikoze, mubyukuri ntabwo yabikoze.
He looked.	Yarebye.
It's good in front of you.	Nibyiza imbere yawe.
He wanted to go to work.	Yashakaga kujya ku kazi.
This worked out very well.	Ibi byagenze neza cyane.
You don't have to do this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
You are doing it yourself.	Urimo kubikora wenyine.
It's just so good I wanted to go back.	Nibyiza cyane gusa nashakaga gusubira hejuru.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
Only top things.	Gusa ibintu byo hejuru.
Everything.	Byose.
Bad boy at school.	Umuhungu mubi ku ishuri.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
And the party went well.	Kandi ibirori byagenze neza.
And he was close.	Kandi yari hafi.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
No one seems to care.	Nta muntu n'umwe uko asa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Same problem.	Ikibazo kimwe.
We are so excited to go.	Turi byiza cyane kugenda.
This is exactly what happened.	Ibi nibyo rwose.
He had no truth in him.	Ntiyari afite ukuri muri we.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
We are just scared.	Dufite ubwoba gusa.
But if not.	Ariko niba atari byo.
He did not know who his father was.	Ntiyari azi se uwo ari we.
I should have had a problem.	Nari nkwiye kugira ikibazo.
We can't say this.	Ibi ntidushobora kuvuga.
He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kugenda.
You are here with me.	Uri hano hamwe nanjye.
But there is something.	Ariko hari ikintu.
It was all.	Yari byose.
You can try this on your own.	Urashobora kugerageza ibi wenyine.
He was well aware of that.	Yari azi neza ibyo.
I want to know what happened.	Ndashaka kumenya uko byagenze.
Walking is good.	Kugenda ni byiza.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
In fact, it is possible.	Mubyukuri, ibyo birashoboka cyane.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
And you have to do the same.	Kandi nawe ugomba kubikora.
I want a baby.	Ndashaka umwana.
He had a lot of money.	Yari afite amafaranga menshi.
There are, however.	Hariho, ariko.
One has to be outside.	Umuntu agomba kuba hanze.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
That it is not far away.	Ko atari kure.
He does nothing.	Ntacyo akora.
It is not difficult to know who.	Ntabwo bigoye kumenya uwo.
You have what you need.	Ufite ibyo ukeneye.
Or another time.	Cyangwa ikindi gihe.
Things to think about.	Ibintu utekereza kuvuga.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko ibyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
That's enough.	Nukuri bihagije.
He had it now.	Yari afite ubu.
He asked what had happened.	Yabajije uko byagenze.
Really something for everyone.	Mubyukuri ikintu kuri buri wese.
That's right, party.	Nibyo, ibirori.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
Lots.	Byinshi.
I like problems.	Nkunda ibibazo.
I don't know what.	Sinzi icyo.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
We have to move forward.	Tugomba kujya imbere.
Just thinking.	Gutekereza gusa.
Where it is.	Aho ari.
I’m not just lucky.	Ntabwo mfite amahirwe gusa.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
He also knew when.	Yari azi kandi igihe.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
That would be tomorrow.	Ibyo byaba ejo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Let your wife.	Reka umugore wawe.
He was not there at all.	Ntabwo yari ahari rwose.
Maybe he is.	Birashoboka ko ari we.
I think you need to go home.	Ntekereza ko ukeneye gutaha.
But that's not it!	Ariko sibyo!.
Walking distance.	Kugenda kure.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
I have a question on this issue.	Mfite ikibazo kuri iki kibazo.
Years, years, years.	Imyaka, imyaka, imyaka.
That's great for me.	Nibyiza cyane kuri njye.
I really can't wait for that !.	Ntabwo rwose nshobora gutegereza ibyo!.
What? 	Niki?
I'm so sorry	Mbabajwe cyane.
The problem is.	Ikibazo ni uko.
I don't know where they are.	Sinzi aho bari.
I would do the same thing.	Nari gukora ikintu kimwe.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
We really should.	Tugomba rwose.
You are now alone.	Ubu uri wenyine.
She was looking for her child.	Yashakaga umwana we.
He did not say what it was.	Ntiyigeze avuga icyo ari cyo.
In it you can play as, well, everything.	Muri yo urashobora gukina nkuko, neza, byose.
We are his children.	Turi abana be.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
It was a big deal.	Byari ikintu kinini.
He also worked for many.	Yakoze kandi kuri benshi.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
That's right- this is not about us.	Ntabwo aribyo, ntabwo aribyo kuri twe.
You have to wait.	Ugomba gutegereza.
But it is me.	Ariko ni njye.
As if he knew something he didn't know.	Nkaho yari azi ikintu atazi.
He had come.	Yari yaje.
I thought quickly.	Natekereje vuba.
You can go to school.	Urashobora kujya mwishuri.
He would not give up.	Ntabwo yari kureka.
I heard he needed it.	Numvise ko akeneye.
It's not hard or nothing.	Ntabwo bigoye cyangwa ntacyo.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
It's good for him.	Ni byiza kuri we.
In everyone, in everything.	Muri buri wese, muri byose.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
From bottom to top.	Kuva hasi kugeza hejuru.
I had no problem.	Nta kibazo nagize.
The truth is, it's not easy.	Ukuri nuko, ntabwo byoroshye.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
You can do it now.	Urashobora kubikora ubu.
Maybe you too.	Birashoboka ko nawe.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
At the time, I didn't think much of it.	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga cyane.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
That's a really good thing.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza rwose.
A woman, a boy, or a girl.	Umugore, umuhungu, cyangwa umukobwa.
And that he took the day.	Kandi ko yafashe umunsi.
I don't know who you are.	Ntazi uwo uri we.
That's not the case now.	Ntabwo aribyo ubu.
I'm not sure why, but it's possible.	Sinzi neza impamvu, ariko birashoboka.
That would be all.	Ibyo byaba byose.
She wanted to be with you.	Yashakaga kubana nawe.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
Every day.	Buri munsi.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
My beautiful wife.	Umugore wanjye mwiza.
Not him, not now.	Ntabwo ari we, si ubu.
He knew what you were doing.	Yari azi ibyo ukora.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
He did not know exactly why.	Ntabwo yari azi neza impamvu.
Probably a phone call.	Birashoboka kuba terefone.
Buying was difficult.	Kugura byari bigoye.
I have never heard of such a thing.	Sinigeze numva ikintu kibi.
Good baby	Umwana mwiza.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu yabonye.
There are a lot of things you need to buy.	Hariho ibintu byinshi ukeneye kugura.
The big one.	Kinini kinini.
I should have been here.	Nari nkwiye kuba hano.
Lots of food.	Ibiryo byinshi.
I need to do it.	Nkeneye kubikora.
Maybe soon.	Yaba ahari vuba.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
You can't be one.	Ntushobora kuba umwe.
She is a wise woman.	Ni umugore uzi ubwenge.
That's right.	Nukuri.
But it was nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yari cyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
I have nothing.	Nta na kimwe mfite.
But you have to stay away.	Ariko ugomba kuguma kure.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
I can't talk to him.	Sinshobora kuvugana na we.
Tell his family.	Bwira umuryango we.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
And away.	Kandi kure.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu bigoye gukora.
He knew what he was saying.	Yari azi ibyo avuga ari ukuri.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I was so happy to see my son.	Nishimiye cyane kubona umuhungu wanjye.
Something for everyone.	Ikintu kuri buri wese.
He had just arrived.	Yari yaje mu gihe gito.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You don't have to listen.	Ntugomba kumva.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
He got food.	Yabonye ibiryo.
He may be right now.	Ashobora kuba ari ubu.
He also has a family.	Afite kandi umuryango.
He was sitting at the time.	Icyo gihe yari yicaye.
Now I know that none of this is true.	Ubu nzi ko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
But in reality it is not.	Ariko mubyukuri sibyo.
At all times, in fact.	Igihe cyose, mubyukuri.
That is not the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
If you have a job.	Niba ufite akazi.
I need to work.	Nkeneye gukora.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza, uko mbona.
All the time is good.	Umwanya wose ni mwiza.
I'm close.	Ndi hafi.
Maybe he should.	Birashoboka ko agomba.
They would even talk.	Mbere bari kuvuga.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
This was a great plan.	Iyi yari gahunda nziza.
You need to go home.	Ukeneye gutaha.
It's a small thing.	Ni ikintu gito.
Good baby	Umwana mwiza.
You too were right.	Nawe wari ufite ukuri.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, byari kubikora.
Absolutely, it looks really good.	Rwose, birasa rwose.
It’s not really something to play with or do.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikintu cyo gukina cyangwa gukora.
It is also not difficult to learn.	Ntabwo kandi bigoye cyane kwiga.
I want my family.	Ndashaka umuryango wanjye.
You have a family.	Ufite umuryango.
You knew what it was.	Wari uzi icyo aricyo.
I just don’t know what to see.	Gusa sinzi icyo mbona.
They both have.	Bombi bafite.
Ask for help.	Gusaba ubufasha.
Especially this week.	Cyane cyane muri iki cyumweru.
I have a reason.	Mfite impamvu.
He needed to know better.	Yari akeneye kumenya neza.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
Sometimes it was good to be lucky.	Rimwe na rimwe byari byiza kugira amahirwe.
One day he may not do it.	Umunsi umwe arashobora kutabikora.
I want to study and work.	Ndashaka kwiga no gukora.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
You don't know what it is.	Ntabwo uzi icyo aricyo.
There is so much here.	Hano hari byinshi cyane.
And you think.	Kandi uratekereza.
If you think before you speak or act.	Niba utekereza mbere yo kuvuga cyangwa gukora.
He is.	Ni we.
Maybe today.	Ahari uyu munsi.
I want to be that way.	Ndashaka kuba uko.
I have a plan to work.	Mfite gahunda yo gukora.
I didn't know what it was.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo.
That will be a problem.	Ibyo bizaba ikibazo.
You can do what you like.	Urashobora gukora ibyo ukunda.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
He went to school.	Yagiye ku ishuri.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
I didn't want to live.	Sinifuzaga kubaho.
Or father.	Cyangwa se.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
He is the first there.	Niwe wa mbere aho.
He was happy to be there.	Yishimiye kuba ahari.
He asked if he could come.	Yabajije niba ashobora kuza.
I had friends.	Nari mfite inshuti.
We are very close.	Turi hafi cyane.
Just trying to survive.	Kugerageza kubaho gusa.
Absolutely.	Reka rwose.
No plans.	Nta gahunda.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo gusa kuri we.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
It was a very bad time.	Wari umwanya mubi cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza gato.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
I have no plans, and I feel good.	Nta gahunda mfite, kandi numva ari byiza.
I know more than most.	Nzi byinshi kuruta byinshi.
Probably tonight.	Birashoboka muri iri joro.
I loved tennis.	Yakundaga tennis.
That’s a good thing, really.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza, mubyukuri.
Maybe it's good.	Ahari nibyiza.
Here is some good advice.	Hano hari inama nziza.
I'm doing well as usual.	Ndimo kugenda neza nkuko bisanzwe.
But that’s probably not a good idea.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari igitekerezo cyiza.
I know where he is.	Nzi aho ari.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
I was his friend.	Nari inshuti ye.
He was at work.	Yari ku kazi.
A very intelligent child.	Umwana uzi ubwenge cyane.
He told me he thought it was good.	Yambwiye ko yatekereje ko ari byiza.
I knew what he wanted to do.	Nari nzi icyo yashakaga gukora.
But he is not alone.	Ariko si we wenyine.
No one knew what to do now.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi icyo gukora ubu.
You need a little time.	Ukeneye igihe gito.
Nothing to see.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kubona.
But this was not a prison.	Ariko iyi ntiyari gereza.
That was it.	Icyo yari cyo.
We don’t have much of a chance at the top.	Ntabwo dufite amahirwe menshi hejuru.
Here, everyone had time.	Hano, abantu bose bari bafite umwanya.
I needed something else.	Nari nkeneye ikindi kintu.
With	Hamwe na.
We.	Ni.
This will not be easy.	Ibi ntabwo bizaba ari ibintu byoroshye.
He did not know where he was or what he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari cyangwa icyo ari cyo.
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
What he had.	Icyo yari afite.
He had to say something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo avuga.
All of us.	Twese.
His wife.	Umugore we.
However, this is not an easy task.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
My wife can't have anything else.	Umugore wanjye ntashobora kugira ikindi.
We are here this week.	Hano turi muri iki cyumweru.
We have to find a way out of here.	Tugomba gushaka uburyo bwo kuva hano.
You like to make friends.	Ukunda gushaka inshuti.
About thirty.	Hafi ya mirongo itatu.
That he thought a lot.	Ko yatekereje cyane.
This is exactly what one person looks like.	Ibi biragaragara ko aribyo umuntu umwe asa.
But the problem is bigger than that.	Ariko ikibazo ni kinini kuruta ibyo.
There is a reason.	Hariho impamvu.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You can't stop doing it.	Ntushobora kureka kubikora.
It was too far.	Byari kure cyane.
Everyone watched everyone not know what to say or do.	Umuntu wese yarebye buri wese atazi icyo avuga cyangwa gukora.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Not much to say about me.	Nta byinshi byo kuvuga kuri njye.
She was a very beautiful and beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza cyane kandi mwiza.
There is a way to do that.	Hariho kubikora.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
Get it right now.	Kubona kuri ubu.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
He went.	Yagiye.
Or maybe he knew exactly where he was.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari azi neza aho ari.
But they had money.	Ariko bari bafite amafaranga.
Someone.	Umuntu.
But that was enough.	Ariko byari bihagije.
We are years old.	Dufite imyaka.
Not later.	Ntabwo nyuma.
However, this would be a good thing.	Ariko, ibi byaba ari ibintu byiza.
But it's really good.	Ariko mubyukuri rwose ni byiza.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
.	.
That's exactly what happened.	Gusa ni ko byagenze.
He enjoyed driving.	Yishimiye gutwara.
Today is me.	Uyu munsi ni njye.
Tell me where he went.	Mbwira aho yagiye.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
I am not an expert.	Ntabwo ndi umuhanga.
I hope you can help.	Nizere ko ushobora gufasha.
I want to be alone.	Ndashaka kuba wenyine.
I know you do.	Nzi ko ukora.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
I mean, just one.	Ndashaka kuvuga, umwe gusa.
But he didn't need much time.	Ariko ntabwo yari akeneye igihe kinini.
That's what we can and should do today.	Nibyo dushobora kandi tugomba gukora uyu munsi.
This sounds like it.	Ibi birasa.
Maybe tomorrow or more.	Ahari ejo cyangwa byinshi.
It is not above him.	Ntabwo ari hejuru ye.
And he meant that at the time.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga icyo gihe.
But that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
About here.	Hafi aha.
It was another bad thing to live.	Byari ikindi kintu kibi cyo kubaho.
I can do nothing on my own.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora wenyine.
Sometimes, it’s just good to look bad.	Rimwe na rimwe, ni byiza gusa kureba nabi.
It's not a big deal for me.	Ntabwo ari kugenda cyane kuri njye.
It was the first day at work.	Wari umunsi wa mbere ku kazi.
And it seems to be true.	Kandi asa nukuri.
We are just human beings.	Turi abantu gusa.
I want to know how to do it.	Ndashaka kumenya kubikora.
Sometimes he wants to do it.	Rimwe na rimwe aba ashaka kubikora.
It’s not the most time I can take.	Ntabwo ari igihe kinini nshobora gufata.
But nothing.	Ariko ntacyo.
To see	Kureba.
I had a lot to do.	Nari mfite byinshi byo gukora.
Me, you might say.	Njye, ushobora kuvuga.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari ahari wenyine.
That's not the case.	Ntabwo ari uko byagenze.
No plans at all.	Nta gahunda rwose.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
And he has friends.	Kandi afite inshuti.
In fact that is possible.	Mubyukuri ibyo birashoboka.
My favorite advice.	Inama nkunda.
But if it is good.	Ariko niba ari byiza.
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.
It looks good.	Birasa naho ari byiza.
There is a truth to this.	Hariho ukuri kuri ibi.
He did things as he went.	Yakoze ibintu uko agenda.
It is not the same time.	Ntabwo ari umwanya umwe.
I am a good player.	Ndi umukinnyi mwiza.
He was at work.	Yari ku kazi.
He saw it soon.	Yabonye vuba.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
Mostly, it is possible.	Byinshi, birashoboka.
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
I don't believe anyone.	Nta muntu nizera.
Very good book.	Igitabo cyiza cyane.
Your good guy.	Umusore wawe mwiza.
He was just thinking.	Yatekerezaga gusa.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I never heard him say that for the first time.	Sinigeze numva avuga ko bwa mbere.
In all things.	Muri byose.
You could say they were close.	Urashobora kuvuga ko bari hafi.
Everyone needs help.	Umuntu wese akeneye gufasha.
Maybe it's good.	Ahari nibyiza.
I need to know if he is right.	Nkeneye kumenya niba afite ukuri.
I am.	Ndi we.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
Larger than we are.	Kinini cyane kuruta uko turi.
I can't say the time.	Sinshobora kuvuga igihe.
Who do you like the most ?.	Ninde ukunda cyane?.
He did enough.	Yakoze bihagije.
And recently.	Kandi vuba aha.
You could say it was a mistake.	Urashobora kuvuga ko byari amakosa.
In any case.	Kuri ibyo aribyo byose.
I can be anything.	Nshobora kuba ikintu cyose.
It was great for that.	Byari byiza cyane kubyo.
I want to know how to do it.	Ndashaka kumenya uburyo bwo gukora.
I'm close.	Ngiye hafi.
For everyone its time.	Kuri buri wese umwanya we.
But that is exactly what happened.	Ariko ibyo nibyo rwose.
Once upon a time	Wigeze.
I can't work.	Sinshobora gukora.
He was a young boy.	Yari umuhungu muto.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
They knew where they were.	Bari bazi aho bari.
He just went.	Yagiye gusa.
Maybe they were right, maybe not.	Birashoboka ko bari bafite ukuri, birashoboka ko atari byo.
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
Especially.	Cyane cyane.
I can do that soon.	Nshobora kubikora vuba vuba.
You have to come.	Ugomba kuza.
Your family is here.	Umuryango wawe uri hano.
He had a job.	Yari afite akazi.
He said you may be right.	Yavuze ko ushobora kuba ufite ukuri.
Only.	Gusa.
You may not know what to learn.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo ushobora kwiga.
There is more to this week.	Muri iki cyumweru hari byinshi.
However, this is not the case here.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
I knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Nari nzi ko atari byo yashakaga.
Day of.	Umunsi wa.
I don't know what to do.	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora.
And that's fine.	Kandi nibyiza.
Absolutely not thinking !.	Rwose ntabwo utekereza!.
It's all good for me.	Byose ni byiza kuri njye.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
You really have it now.	Ufite rwose ubu.
He had a wife.	Yari afite umugore.
And he.	Na we.
We have to go far, fast.	Tugomba kujya kure, vuba.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
I hope you found it.	Nizere ko wabonye.
It was good to stay.	Byari byiza kuguma.
But I'm not sure how to do it.	Ariko sinzi neza uburyo bwo kubikora.
Very well, in fact I am.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri ni njye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He is also the producer of many films.	Niwe kandi ukora firime nyinshi.
You saw the problem.	Wabonye ikibazo.
That is why.	Iyo ni yo mpamvu.
It was great for us.	Kuri twe byari byiza cyane.
He thought it would be nice.	Yatekereje ko byari kuba byiza.
It was really nice to do it.	Byari byiza rwose kubikora.
You don't know this world.	Ntabwo uzi iyi si.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
You can't give up now.	Ntushobora kureka ubu.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
If this is possible.	Niba ibi bishoboka.
I'm glad to go.	Nishimiye kugenda.
Where is he.	Ari he.
I don't want to stay.	Sinshaka kuguma.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Do you have an opinion on that.	Waba ufite igitekerezo kuri ibyo.
That he wanted to party.	Ko yashakaga gukora ibirori.
He has to tell me what to do.	Agomba kumbwira icyo gukora.
Either way, he had a lot of money.	Ibyo ari byo byose, yari afite amafaranga menshi.
It's good to see this.	Nibyiza kubona ibi.
She is very young and beautiful and.	Ari muto cyane kandi mwiza kandi.
I think he saw exactly what he said he saw.	Ntekereza ko yabonye neza ibyo yavuze yabonye.
He must have a reason.	Agomba kuba afite impamvu.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ikintu ni iki.
But you can't do that.	Ariko ntushobora kubikora.
I have to be close.	Ngomba kuba hafi.
He would not say what he was.	Icyo yari cyo ntabwo yari kuvuga.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
But he was scared.	Ariko yagize ubwoba.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I knew he had problems.	Nari nzi ko afite ibibazo.
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
I'm not sure what you mean.	Ntabwo numvise neza icyo ushaka kuvuga.
We have to go home.	Tugomba gutaha.
I don't think we're doing it.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko turi kubikora.
Or us.	Cyangwa natwe.
That's a long time.	Icyo ni igihe kirekire.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Just something to think about.	Gusa ikintu cyo gutekereza.
He could only see.	Yashoboraga kureba gusa.
He has a lot.	Afite byinshi.
I can't say why today.	Sinshobora kuvuga impamvu muri iki gihe.
Absolutely.	Rwose.
The woman, however, saw nothing.	Umugore ariko, ntacyo yabonye.
That time is near.	Icyo gihe ni hafi.
I knew he had the truth.	Nari nzi ko afite ukuri.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
Away.	Kure.
I didn’t think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga cyane.
But for me.	Ariko kuri njye.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
But that is not a big deal.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
Or he may not have.	Cyangwa ntashobora kuba afite.
But he had not gone.	Ariko ntiyari yagiye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka mubyukuri.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
He went there.	Yagiye aho.
This worked out very well.	Ibi byagenze neza cyane.
He was sure he would do it.	Yari azi neza ko azabikora.
It is not a chance.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe.
I didn't have to come.	Sinari nkwiye kuza.
I was not very skilled.	Ntabwo nari umuhanga cyane.
But he wanted to go home.	Ariko yashakaga gutaha.
And it was great to be here.	Kandi byari ibintu byiza cyane kuza hano.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
You don't have to do anything else.	Ntugomba gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
You have advice.	Ufite inama.
All the while.	Icyo gihe cyose.
You have the right wife at home.	Ufite umugore ukwiye murugo.
And that's just it.	Ibyo kandi nibyo gusa.
It's not a job.	Ntabwo ari akazi.
The problem is.	Ikibazo niki.
And it was true.	Kandi byari ukuri.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza rwose.
However, today was not the day to do so.	Ariko, uyumunsi ntabwo wari umunsi wo kubikora.
Now I feel like a family.	Ubu ndumva ndi umuryango.
It was not good to see.	Ntabwo byari byiza kubona.
Nothing was wrong.	Ntacyo byari cyo.
This is true for most of us.	Ibi ni ukuri kuri benshi muri twe.
And they probably were.	Kandi birashoboka ko bari.
He is behind her.	Ari inyuma ye.
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi.
I'm glad he did.	Nishimiye ko yabikoze.
He was about to win.	Yari agiye gutsinda.
They both know it's not easy.	Bombi bazi ko atari ibintu byoroshye.
That's right, man.	Nibyiza, muntu.
I mean, that's right.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibyo ni ukuri.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
Me and you	Ninjye nawe.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He wanted to be close.	Yashakaga kuba hafi.
This is not possible.	Ntabwo ari uko bishoboka.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
The reason is not always money.	Impamvu ntabwo buri gihe ari amafaranga.
You don't know what's wrong.	Ntabwo uzi ikintu kibi.
He has a lot of that.	Afite byinshi muri byo.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
We can't have it now.	Ntidushobora kugira ubu.
She is not a woman.	Ntabwo ari umugore.
He used to do it.	Yakundaga kubikora.
Bombi.	Bombi.
Now the car is very nice.	Ubu imodoka ni nziza cyane.
It's good for me.	Ni byiza kuri njye.
Now it is possible.	Ubu birashoboka.
It was very bad.	Yari mubi cyane.
Absolutely.	Rwose.
I did the same.	Ninjye wabikoze.
I am old enough to play.	Mfite imyaka yo gukina.
Nothing big.	Nta kintu kinini.
He can do it.	Arashobora kubikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's all about him.	Byose kuri we.
We have to help.	Tugomba gufasha.
You can't tell who you can find !.	Ntushobora kumenya uwo ushobora kubona!.
Maybe it's good.	Ahari nibyiza.
For now, that is not the case.	Kuri ubu, ntabwo aribyo.
He could have stayed.	Yashoboraga kuguma.
She is beautiful	Niwe mwiza.
Too much walking.	Kugenda cyane.
We were just kids.	Twari abana gusa.
I think that was good.	Ndakeka ko ibyo byari byiza.
Or if it's a lot of problems, that's fine.	Cyangwa niba ari ibibazo byinshi, nibyiza.
I am here every night.	Ndi hano buri joro.
He did it all.	Yakoze byose.
He said it was not now.	Yavuze ko atari ubu.
You just have to tell me.	Ugomba kumbwira gusa.
He thought he was going to drive.	Yatekereje ko yagiye gutwara imodoka.
It's just you and me.	Ni wowe na njye gusa.
At the time, he was well-aware and fearful.	Icyo gihe yari azi neza, afite ubwoba.
From then on I wanted to go.	Kuva icyo gihe nashakaga kugenda.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, nibyo kuri njye.
He didn't have enough to do.	Ntabwo yari afite ibintu bihagije byo gukora.
He never understood how.	Ntiyigeze yumva uburyo.
I just need to find something in me.	Gusa nkeneye kubona ikintu muri njye.
He seemed to be talking too far.	Yasaga naho avuga kure cyane.
He didn't want to eat.	Ntiyashakaga kurya.
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
You are beautiful too.	Nawe uri mwiza.
Not tomorrow.	Ntabwo ari ejo.
Really good thing.	Nukuri mubyukuri ikintu cyiza.
The reason is exactly what I thought.	Impamvu nibyo rwose natekereje.
He had a job to do.	Yari afite akazi ko gukora.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ari ukuri.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
Near him, nothing.	Hafi ye, nta kintu na kimwe.
He did not know what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
I love the way he works.	Nkunda uburyo akora.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
He became very human.	Yaje kuba umuntu cyane.
I would do anything.	Nari gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I would not have made that film.	Ntabwo nari gukora iyo firime.
You.	Wowe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I'm sure there is nothing wrong with that.	Nzi neza ko nta cyiza.
I really heard something.	Nukuri numvise hari ikintu.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
No one was alone.	Nta muntu yari wenyine.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
You are the only one we can trust.	Niwowe wenyine dushobora kwizera.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He was sitting.	Yari yicaye.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
I'm going to find out why.	Ngiye gushaka kumenya impamvu.
That's not the case with me.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri njye.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
To understand why.	Kumva impamvu.
Very high indeed.	Hejuru cyane rwose.
I don't want to go.	Sinshaka kugenda.
But not many people.	Ariko ntabwo ari abantu benshi.
At any time.	Igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
But you are.	Ariko uri.
But he went.	Ariko yagiye.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
Reka.	Reka.
This is not much.	Ibi ntabwo ari byinshi.
Or maybe it's not him.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari we.
But here’s the good thing.	Ariko hano hari ikintu cyiza.
Well, well, well.	Nibyiza, nibyiza.
I think that's a good idea.	Ntekereza ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
I haven’t thought about much so far.	Ntabwo natekereje kuri byinshi kugeza ubu.
But not today.	Ariko si uyu munsi.
Everything would be fine.	Byose byari kuba byiza.
I can't do that at all.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora rwose.
Maybe one day.	Ahari umunsi umwe.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
And like him, he was not young.	Kandi nka we, ntabwo yari akiri muto.
Let's go.	Ni gito.
He never had.	Ntiyigeze agira.
But they have.	Ariko bafite.
He was in prison.	Yari gereza.
What? 	Niki?
he says.	avuga.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
And that is true.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri.
You got it right.	Wabonye neza.
Not many people knew much about us.	Ntabwo abantu benshi bari bazi byinshi kuri twe.
It was not a job.	Ntabwo byari akazi.
Fear.	Ubwoba.
I now have a wife.	Ubu mfite umugore.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
Travel time.	Igihe cyo kugenda.
I want to help.	Ndashaka gufasha.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba kubikora neza.
But not now.	Ariko si ubu.
I want to do better.	Ndashaka gukora neza.
This is the only one.	Uyu niwe wenyine.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
It was close enough.	Yari hafi bihagije.
I want to be both.	Ndashaka kuba bombi.
I want to work again.	Ndashaka kongera gukora.
No one can go back.	Nta muntu ushobora gusubira inyuma.
He needed people.	Yari akeneye abantu.
You or your child is a player.	Wowe cyangwa umwana wawe ni umukinnyi.
For him.	Kuri we.
It's all me.	Byose ni njye.
I can't do this again.	Ntashobora kongera gukora ibi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, yari kubikora.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Every day.	Buri munsi.
But my family.	Ariko umuryango wanjye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
A lot of money was high.	Amafaranga menshi yari hejuru.
My family.	Umuryango wanjye.
But sometimes it is not.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe sibyo.
Here, no one.	Hano, nta muntu.
I can't wait to read it away from you.	Sinshobora gutegereza gusoma kure yawe.
Yaba.	Yaba.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
And it is possible that there is truth in the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko hari ukuri kuri kuri.
He did what he said.	Yakoze ibyo yavuze.
He looked at the problem in front of him.	Yarebye ikibazo imbere ye.
He loved the problem.	Yakundaga cyane ikibazo.
And he meant.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga.
'	'
I hope there is more out there.	Nizera ko hari byinshi hanze aha.
He said it was a problem.	Yavuze ko ari ikibazo.
He never did one of those things.	Ntabwo yigeze akora kimwe muri ibyo.
It's just something for me.	Ni ikintu gusa kuri njye.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
I was not sure what that was, but it was true.	Sinari nzi neza icyo, ariko byari ukuri.
I thought it was my age or I was doing it wrong.	Natekerezaga ko ari imyaka yanjye cyangwa nkora nabi.
He has nothing to say, or anything to say.	Nta cyo avuga, cyangwa ntacyo afite cyo kuvuga.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He knew both.	Yari azi bombi.
He said he was.	Yavuze ko ari.
Children.	Abana.
You know how to catch people.	Uzi gufata abantu.
I'm not a bad boy.	Ntabwo ndi umuhungu mubi.
Especially not for him.	Cyane cyane ntabwo kuri we.
I wanted to see more.	Nashakaga kubona byinshi.
Not only that.	Gusa sibyo gusa.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I don't really want to.	Sinshaka rwose.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
And sitting outside, her son was there.	Kandi yicaye hanze, umuhungu we yari ahari.
I don't know if that's the case.	Sinzi niba aribyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I like to try and work.	Nkunda kugerageza no gukora.
But he was going to do it.	Ariko yari agiye kubikora.
I'm really happy with where we are.	Nishimiye rwose aho turi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He never had.	Ntiyigeze agira.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
Maybe nothing.	Ahari ntacyo.
And you can't either.	Kandi nawe ntushobora.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
It's not something you have.	Ntabwo ari ikintu ufite.
That's great.	Ibyo ni byiza cyane.
I know he's just human.	Nzi ko ari umuntu gusa.
I don't think that's possible.	Ntabwo mbona ko bishoboka.
That was not the case.	Ntabwo byari byo.
As if.	Nkaho.
He got the money.	Yabonye amafaranga.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
We need to get out of here as soon as possible.	Tugomba kuva hano vuba bishoboka.
Only problems are not here.	Gusa ibibazo ntabwo ari hano.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
He was going to do it.	Yari agiye kubikora.
I think I'll be back soon.	Ndatekereza gutaha vuba.
Very soon, someone will do it.	Vuba cyane, umuntu azabikora.
Apparently he has a reading problem.	Biragaragara ko afite ikibazo cyo gusoma.
I really need to do it.	Nkeneye rwose kubikora.
You may not know exactly what you need.	Ntushobora kumenya neza icyo ukeneye.
He is playing money.	Arimo gukina amafaranga.
It's a real thing.	Ni ikintu rwose.
But not tonight.	Ariko si iri joro.
Someone was going to play.	Umuntu yari agiye gukina.
He wants to talk to you.	Ashaka kuvugana nawe.
He may have had an idea.	Ashobora kuba yari afite igitekerezo.
I have nothing.	Mfite ikintu na kimwe.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu kibi cyane gukora.
We can't figure out why.	Ntidushobora kumenya impamvu.
Drink or take.	Kunywa cyangwa gufata.
I've seen enough.	Nabonye bihagije.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
He loved everything.	Yakundaga byose.
He had a house.	Yari afite inzu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I know his family.	Nzi umuryango we.
And no one ever did.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
He went to do it.	Yagiye kubikora.
I also like to do things.	Nkunda kandi gukora ibintu.
They know nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe bazi.
On that day.	Kuri uwo munsi.
He knew exactly what he was thinking.	Yari azi neza icyo yatekerezaga.
He wants the truth.	Ashaka ukuri.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
First of all, a beautiful girl.	Mbere, umukobwa mwiza.
And it's bad.	Kandi ni mubi.
It’s something to watch.	Ni ikintu cyo kureba.
We have a plan.	Dufite gahunda.
It would just be nice.	Byaba ari byiza gusa.
To take	Gufata.
Just living with him.	Gusa kubana na we.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
He and I are friends.	We na njye, turi inshuti.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hari umuntu wabikoze.
I welcome any idea.	Nishimiye igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose.
He knows the food.	Azi ibiryo.
That is the same thing.	Icyo ni ikintu kimwe.
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane, mwiza cyane.
Car.	Imodoka.
It wasn’t just me.	Ntabwo yari njye gusa.
If only for a short time.	Niba ari mugihe gito.
I'm here to work.	Ndi hano gukora.
There is only work to be done.	Hariho gukora gusa.
But it was his favorite thing.	Ariko byari ibintu yakundaga.
You want to take everyone.	Wowe ushaka kujyana abantu bose.
It was not for him.	Ntabwo yari kuri we.
That's right, this is just a movie.	Nibyo, ni firime gusa.
He did not ask for anything.	Ntacyo yasabye.
I didn't say anything to anyone.	Ntacyo nabwiye umuntu.
He works alone.	Akora wenyine.
There is a lot to know here.	Hano hari byinshi byo kumenya.
Probably if.	Birashoboka niba.
He finally decided to come.	Amaherezo yahisemo kuza.
? 	?
I can hear nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora kumva.
But only.	Ariko gusa.
He is just a man.	Ni umuntu gusa.
He has a plan for each of us.	Afite gahunda kuri buri wese muri twe.
Or him.	Cyangwa we.
Uri.	Uri.
I think they are both.	Ntekereza ko ari bombi.
Please let go.	Nyamuneka reka.
It was a good idea.	Byari igitekerezo cyiza.
Definitely a big problem.	Rwose ikibazo kinini.
He thought that now or never.	Yatekereje ko ubu cyangwa nta na rimwe.
I know nothing.	Ntacyo nzi.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
This is bad.	Iki ni kibi.
You are ashamed.	Ufite isoni.
He definitely has the best things to do.	Afite rwose ibintu byiza byo gukora.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
I'm sure he's right.	Nzi neza ko afite ukuri.
I have to wait another time.	Nkwiye gutegereza ikindi gihe.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
This was true.	Ibi byari mubyukuri.
I like difficult things.	Nkunda ibintu bigoye.
My daughter didn’t have one.	Umukobwa wanjye ntabwo yari afite.
He was who he was.	Yari uwo yari we.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atabikoze.
When you can do that, everything is possible.	Iyo ushobora gukora ibyo, byose birashoboka.
You do a lot on your own.	Ukora byinshi wenyine.
And he was there.	Kandi yari ahari.
In fact, that is not possible.	Mubyukuri, ibyo bishoboka ntabwo bishoboka.
He is here.	Ari hano.
She is so beautiful and beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane kandi mwiza.
And that is temporary.	Kandi icyo ni igihe gito.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
He thought he could wait a while.	Yibwiraga ko ashobora gutegereza igihe gito.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
She loves clothes.	Akunda imyenda.
It would be very difficult.	Byaba bigoye cyane.
I only have this.	Mfite ibi gusa.
What you said	Ibyo wavuze.
They don't know what to do.	Ntabwo bazi icyo gukora.
He went.	Yagiye.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
I was about to leave.	Nari hafi yo kugenda.
But being there.	Ariko kuba ahari.
So do we.	Natwe natwe.
I know fear.	Nzi ubwoba.
He could have done it for no reason.	Yashoboraga kubikora nta mpamvu.
That's a good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
I think he should have.	Ntekereza ko agomba kuba afite.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Everyone had a chance.	Umuntu wese yari afite umwanya.
He said no one.	Yavuze ko nta muntu n'umwe.
He described the situation.	Yavuze uko byagenze.
My son needs a job.	Umuhungu wanjye akeneye akazi.
It was all true.	Byose byari ukuri.
'	'
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
Everyone took the time.	Umwe wese yafashe umwanya.
Most of you.	Byinshi muri.
No one was in the house.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari muri iyo nzu.
I can't think of one today.	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri kimwe muri iki gihe.
I understand what you want.	Ndumva icyo ushaka.
Or, most likely, not.	Cyangwa, birashoboka cyane, ntabwo.
To do so.	Kubikora.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
I am at home.	Ndi murugo.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
It will be difficult.	Bizaba bigoye.
I think he had.	Ntekereza ko yari afite.
You can't go wrong.	Ntushobora kugenda nabi.
To here	Kuri hano.
It was just an idea.	Byari igitekerezo gusa.
But that is probably not the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari byo.
BACK	NYUMA
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
You said you could talk to him.	Wavuze ko ushobora kuvugana nawe.
I'm here now.	Ndi hano ubu.
Or that he once ate.	Cyangwa ko yigeze kurya.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
I need to eat.	Nkeneye kurya.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
I had another problem.	Nari mfite ikindi kibazo.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko aribyo.
And this is not what we need.	Kandi ibi ntabwo aribyo dukeneye.
He said he was.	Yavuze ko ari.
It's not as if he never had a chance.	Ntabwo ari nkaho atigeze agira amahirwe.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Or maybe he didn't.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atabikoze.
Good to see.	Nibyiza kubona.
Anyone can do it now.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora nonaha.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
Nice to meet you.	Nishimiye kubana nawe.
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
It seems.	Birasa.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
I never believed.	Sinigeze nizera.
Where was he?	Yari he?
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
You have to be very close.	Ugomba kuba hafi cyane.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's his fault.	Ni amakosa ye.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's the same with him.	Birasa na we.
He thought. 	Yatekereje.
He is alone.	We wenyine.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
He is very close.	Ari hafi cyane.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
I can't think of anything.	Ntacyo nshobora gutekereza.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba gukora neza.
Nothing.	Ntacyo ari cyo.
Sitting in front of him.	Yicaye imbere ye.
That's a good thing.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza.
They were not.	Ntabwo bari.
Although.	Naho.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo.
I have to eat.	Ngomba kurya.
I love children.	Nkunda abana.
I'm not sure what to do.	Sinzi neza icyo gukora.
That you were here.	Ko wari hano.
Maybe then it would have happened.	Ahari icyo gihe byari kuba.
I was here.	Nari hano.
I wonder what I did wrong.	Ndabaza icyo nakoze nabi.
He is.	Niwe.
Everyone was scared.	Abantu bose bari bafite ubwoba.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And he was really a good friend.	Kandi rwose yari inshuti nziza.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
I am a teacher.	Ndi umwarimu.
He lives here.	Aba hano.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
Both are good.	Bombi nta cyiza.
You really are.	Urimo rwose.
I like food.	Nkunda ibiryo.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
But not in this one.	Ariko si muri iyi.
It's not over.	Ntabwo yamaze.
It's a lot of money.	Ni amafaranga menshi.
That's right.	Ni byo.
No questions asked.	Nta kibazo yabajije.
Everyone had.	Umuntu wese yari afite.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
For many like.	Kuri benshi nka.
You need to know how to do it.	Ugomba kumenya kubikora.
It's not here, or here.	Ntabwo ari hano, cyangwa hano.
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
But he was my friend.	Ariko yari inshuti yanjye.
This sounds great, though.	Ibi birasa cyane, ariko.
This was easy for me.	Ibi byari byoroshye kuri njye.
He heard nothing.	Ntacyo yumvise.
He could see nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
And there is something.	Kandi hariho ikintu.
And that’s exactly why.	Kandi rwose ni impamvu.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
It was not enough to do.	Ntabwo byari bihagije gukora.
You can't do that when you're bad.	Ntushobora kubikora mugihe uri mubi.
You always have to ask for more.	Ugomba buri gihe gusaba byinshi.
He is a top player.	Ni umukinnyi wo hejuru.
You are not really scared.	Ntabwo rwose ufite ubwoba.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu umuntu adashaka.
This is not a good idea.	Iyi ntabwo ari inama nziza.
Good vision.	Kubona neza.
One is bad.	Umwe ni mubi.
One was thirty.	Umwe yari mirongo itatu.
High time.	Igihe cyo hejuru.
I'm not sure why this would happen.	Sinzi neza impamvu ibi byaba.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
The big thing is too long.	Ikintu kinini kirekire cyane.
But this one was at home.	Ariko iyi yari murugo.
And he wouldn't be alone.	Kandi ntiyari kuba akiri wenyine.
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
It is also possible that this is true.	Birashoboka kandi ko ari ukuri.
My car is out.	Imodoka yanjye hanze.
Children are worried.	Abana bafite impungenge.
You have	Ufite.
He may have something to do.	Ashobora kugira icyo akora.
What we have now.	Ibyo dufite ubu.
I told that.	Nabwiye uwo.
I haven't had a long time.	Ntabwo nagize igihe kirekire.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I want that.	Ndashaka ibyo.
This was one young man.	Uyu yari umusore umwe.
It would be easier soon.	Byaba byoroshye vuba.
I'm sure that is the case now.	Nzi neza ko ibyo ubu.
I thought badly.	Natekereje nabi.
When it was new.	Iyo yari nshya.
I never saw you look good.	Sinigeze mbona ko usa neza.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Apparently not him.	Biragaragara ko atari we.
My son was in it too.	Umuhungu wanjye na we yari muri we.
He did not know what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo.
No one has ever heard of this.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze yumva ibi.
Is this possible? 	Ibi birashoboka?
There is.	Hariho.
As long as you have, until you have children.	Kugeza igihe ufite, kugeza ufite abana.
I should do more.	Nkwiye gukora byinshi.
I have a lot of luck.	Mfite amahirwe menshi.
Just what he needed.	Gusa icyo yari akeneye.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
But there is one thing, down.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe, hasi.
I can't believe he knows what it is.	Sinshobora kumva ko azi icyo aricyo.
I am not a reading teacher.	Ntabwo ndi umwarimu wo gusoma.
All together !.	Bose hamwe!.
I work hard, very hard.	Nkora cyane, cyane.
He is your favorite.	Ni wowe akunda.
You're not going to do it.	Ntabwo ugiye kubikora.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
Today he was not lucky.	Uyu munsi ntabwo yari afite amahirwe.
There is this.	Hariho ibi.
But she was a girl.	Ariko yari umukobwa.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
He didn't know where to go.	Ntiyari azi aho agomba kujya.
And in fact.	Kandi mubyukuri.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kumenya gusa.
I am very sorry for the inconvenience.	Mbabajwe cyane n'iki kibazo.
Being there.	Kuba ahari.
It's a great movie.	Ni firime nziza cyane.
He had nothing to say.	Ntiyari afite icyo avuga.
That's not the case with your plan.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri gahunda yawe.
I hope we can do that.	Nizera ko dushobora kubikora.
My wife.	Umugore wanjye.
Good to see.	Nibyiza kubona.
Recently, he thought of doing it on his own.	Vuba aha, yatekereje gukora wenyine.
You should study as soon as possible.	Ugomba kwiga vuba bishoboka.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora kuri ibyo.
We are not.	Ntabwo turi.
And that you were a really good player.	Kandi ko wari umukinnyi mwiza rwose.
It was all true.	Byose byari ukuri rwose.
I don't think about it for a while.	Ntacyo ntekereza mugihe gito.
It's not a small thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu gito.
Sometimes a day.	Rimwe na rimwe ku munsi.
I mean, it's great.	Ndashaka kuvuga, nibyiza cyane.
We are his family.	Turi umuryango we.
You can walk, especially for a long time.	Urashobora kugenda cyane cyane igihe kirekire.
And it was not good.	Kandi ntabwo byari byiza.
He thinks this is a good thing.	Yibwira ko iki ari ikintu cyiza.
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
Her clothes were beautiful.	Imyenda ye yari nziza.
Getting a plan.	Kubona gahunda.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
However, this is not good.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
But this.	Ariko ibi.
You have an idea.	Ufite igitekerezo.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
You had it all.	Wari ufite byose.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
Here you can expect everything for me.	Aha ushobora gutegereza ikintu cyose kuri njye.
We have to eat.	Tugomba kurya.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
That's right, here.	Nibyo, hano.
But it is not good.	Ariko si byiza.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I didn't know what to believe.	Sinari nzi icyo nizera.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
There is no one involved.	Nta muntu n'umwe urimo.
The top was down.	Hejuru yari hasi.
He did something.	Yagize icyo akora.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko aribyo.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
John was not there.	Yohana ntiyari ahari.
I really like the plan.	Nkunda rwose gahunda.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
Today he would say.	Uyu munsi yari kuvuga.
Looks like you're in.	Birasa nkaho urimo.
People have problems.	Abantu bafite ibibazo.
I wanted to see my wife before dinner.	Nashakaga kubona umugore wanjye mbere yo kurya.
Anyway.	Nigute.
Or you can go.	Cyangwa urashobora kugenda.
It was up to me.	Nanjye byari kuri njye.
I am a bad girl.	Ndi umukobwa mubi.
I can't go far.	Sinshobora kujya kure.
He bought one of them.	Yaguze kimwe muri byo.
He never wanted to do it again.	Ntiyigeze yifuza kongera kubikora.
You have to take someone.	Ugomba kujyana umuntu.
And once upon a time.	Kandi rimwe hejuru.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
We must also work.	Tugomba kandi gukora.
But he does well.	Ariko akora neza.
These are certainly not many.	Aba rwose ntabwo ari benshi.
I am not your wife.	Ntabwo ndi umugore wawe.
Everything he said was enough.	Ibyo yavuze byose byari bihagije.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
Here, nothing.	Hano, nta kintu na kimwe.
He wants to try to make things better for everyone.	Arashaka kugerageza gukora ibintu neza kuri buri wese.
But it is not difficult to try.	Ariko ntabwo bigoye kugerageza.
To come	Kuza.
And come.	Kandi kuza.
I know the truth.	Nzi ukuri.
He is not doing well.	Ntabwo akora neza.
But it is a house.	Ariko ni inzu.
He says another time.	Avuga ko ikindi gihe.
They didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo bari bazi icyo.
He does a lot of things.	Akora ibintu byinshi.
I never thought of this.	Sinigeze ntekereza ibi.
He tried this.	Yagerageje ibi.
You're a good boy, that's fine.	Uri umuhungu mwiza, nibyiza.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
It's good for what we need.	Nibyiza kubyo dukeneye.
He is completely seated.	Yicaye rwose.
He was a family, a family.	Yari umuryango, umuryango.
Not if you want to go back outside.	Ntabwo niba ushaka gusubira hanze.
I guess so.	Ndakeka ko aribyo.
Everything we need to know.	Ikintu cyose dukeneye kumenya.
If we have a problem, we have this.	Niba dufite ikibazo, twe ibi.
Since then	Kuva icyo gihe.
Not just his wife.	Ntabwo ari umugore we gusa.
I once did.	Nigeze kubikora.
This is not difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye.
But I can't.	Ariko ntashobora.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
It wasn’t me, but it was close.	Ntabwo yari njye, ariko byari hafi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari mwiza.
He would not exist.	Ntabwo yari kubaho.
You have something else.	Ufite ikindi kintu.
You can't stay here alone.	Ntushobora kuguma hano wenyine.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ahari, kugeza ubu.
He thought he was not good.	Yatekereje ko atari mwiza.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
Everything was normal.	Ibintu byose byari bisanzwe.
He can do much better than that.	Arashobora gukora byinshi byiza kurenza ibyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I want to try something else.	Ndashaka kugerageza ikindi kintu.
You are lucky.	Ufite amahirwe yawe.
I think we have it here.	Ndatekereza ko dufite hano.
It's good to be together.	Nibyiza kubana.
That was me, now.	Uwo yari njye, ubu.
It is not your family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango wawe.
Please advise.	Nyamuneka nyamuneka inama.
He looked into the room.	Yarebye mu cyumba.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
You ?.	Niwowe?.
I guess so.	Ndakeka yuko.
It was not good for me.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri njye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
And he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Kandi, yari azi ko agomba kubikora vuba.
Just one.	Umwe gusa.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
Maybe you need a job.	Birashoboka ko ukeneye kubona akazi.
You have to make a movie.	Ugomba gukora firime.
Maybe he's gone now.	Birashoboka ko yagiye ubu.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
But the idea is this.	Ariko igitekerezo ni iki.
In the movie.	Na firime.
Glad to know it worked out.	Nishimiye kumenya ko byagenze neza.
I think this meeting.	Ntekereza ko iyi nama.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
He is not a young child.	Ntabwo ari umwana muto.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
Very bad thing.	Ikintu kibi cyane.
I do everything on my phone.	Nkora ibintu byose kuri terefone yanjye.
But that's all there is to it.	Ariko ibyo byose ni uburyo.
I was good enough.	Nari mwiza bihagije.
Time, truth.	Igihe, ukuri.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I didn’t just need a book.	Sinari nkeneye igitabo gusa.
And you can do that.	Kandi urashobora kubikora.
This is probably easier said than done.	Ibi birashoboka ko byoroshye.
But he could hear nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kumva.
I understand why you did it.	Ndumva impamvu wabikoze.
This is good.	Ubu ni byiza.
All of this is not here or here.	Ibi byose ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
But that would be very difficult.	Ariko ibyo byaba bigoye cyane.
Everyone was outside but him.	Abantu bose bari hanze ariko we.
As they all had.	Nkuko bose bari bafite.
Of course, not everything went smoothly.	Nibyo, ibintu byose ntabwo buri gihe byagenze neza.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
When you have to work, you have to work.	Iyo ugomba gukora, ugomba gukora.
And the work he did !.	Kandi akazi yakoze!.
You have to win, and win, and win.	Ugomba gutsinda, no gutsinda, no gutsinda.
He was at home here.	Hano yari murugo.
Your daughter will probably do it.	Umukobwa wawe birashoboka ko azabikora.
But everything went well.	Ariko byose byagenze neza.
We really are not.	Ntabwo rwose turi.
Seems like enough.	Birasa nkaho bihagije.
He thought of her.	Yatekereje kuri we.
And you want more.	Kandi urashaka byinshi.
It was enough to watch.	Kureba byari bihagije.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
But you.	Ariko wowe.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
It was my age.	Yari imyaka yanjye.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
This is not true at all.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri na gato.
Walking in us.	Kugenda muri twe.
And he didn't know why.	Kandi ntiyari azi impamvu.
If we really have.	Niba koko dufite.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
He really told me to live.	Yambwiye rwose kubaho.
Do you have a baby 	Ufite umwana?
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
I need them all.	Nkeneye bose.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
It's a prison.	Ni gereza.
He was a young man.	Yari umuntu muto.
As in almost everything in me.	Nkuko byagenze hafi ya byose muri njye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I enjoyed this movie.	Nishimiye iyi firime.
But it seems.	Ariko birasa.
It’s not very good to do.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane gukora.
You like to eat.	Ukunda kurya.
He was a very thoughtful person.	Yari umuntu utekereza cyane.
You need it sometimes.	Ukeneye rimwe na rimwe.
That's not right.	Ibyo sibyo.
I like problems.	Nkunda ibibazo.
You have to play with what you get.	Ugomba gukina nibyo wabonye.
We have to work first.	Tugomba gukora mbere.
I hope you did.	Ndizera ko wabikoze.
I never heard of that.	Sinigeze numva ibyo.
To help	Gufasha.
It is not one and the same.	Ntabwo ari umwe kandi umwe.
But that’s not the movie he wanted to make.	Ariko iyo ntabwo ari firime yashakaga gukora.
That would really be a lot.	Ibyo rwose byaba ari byinshi cyane.
Of course, he wanted to be his friend.	Ni ukuri, yashakaga kuba inshuti ye.
And above all.	Kandi hejuru ya byose.
I had none of that.	Ntabwo nari mfite kimwe muri ibyo.
He did.	Yabikoze.
Maybe he can do something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo ashobora gukora.
Down together.	Hasi hamwe.
He has good things.	Afite ibintu byiza.
Outside.	Hanze.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
This morning.	Iki gitondo .
He didn’t expect it to be good.	Ntabwo yiteze ko ari byiza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It was behind me.	Byari inyuma yanjye.
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
It wasn't good, it wasn't good.	Ntabwo byari byiza, ntabwo byari byiza.
I think every day, every night.	Ntekereza buri munsi, buri joro.
He was not where he wanted to be.	Ntabwo yari aho yashakaga kuba.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
In the end, it was all money.	Amaherezo, byose byari amafaranga.
Not true here.	Ntabwo ari ukuri hano.
It was a sight to behold.	Byari ibintu byo kureba hasi.
I can't find a job.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona akazi.
It was great !.	Byari byiza rwose!.
There is something else you have to do.	Hariho ikindi kintu ugomba gukora.
You obviously know what you're doing.	Biragaragara ko uzi ibyo ukora.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
I can't talk to you right now.	Sinshobora kuvugana nawe ubu.
This will be a lot.	Ibi bizaba byinshi.
Anyone with a good idea, please.	Umuntu wese ufite igitekerezo cyiza, nyamuneka.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
Every last one of us.	Buri wese wa nyuma muri twe.
I only needed one.	Nari nkeneye rimwe gusa.
But he was scared.	Ariko yari afite ubwoba.
It was more difficult than working.	Byari bigoye kuruta mugihe cyo gukora.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
Just friends, that's all.	Inshuti gusa, nibyo byose.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
Seeing as long as you are lucky.	Kubona igihe cyose ufite amahirwe.
He did what he wanted.	Yakoze ibyo ashaka.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
I want to do it in a movie.	Ndashaka kubikora muri firime.
They had a lot of problems.	Bari bafite ibibazo byinshi.
Anyway, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, afite ukuri rwose.
But she was a very beautiful woman.	Ariko yari umugore mwiza cyane.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
In fact they were.	Mubyukuri bari.
Drink more.	Kunywa byinshi.
Same as before.	Kimwe nka mbere.
I like to have people.	Nkunda kugira abantu.
He tried it yesterday.	Yagerageje ejo.
I can't do it again.	Sinshobora kongera kubikora.
But it will be better.	Ariko bizaba byiza.
Here we are.	Ni hano.
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
I have them all here.	Mfite bose hano.
But as usual.	Ariko nkuko bisanzwe.
He did not advise.	Ntiyigeze agira inama.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko nawe ari.
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
So far, no problem.	Kugeza ubu, nta kibazo.
I just have.	Mfite gusa.
They are smart.	Bafite ubwenge.
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
He thought everything would be fine.	Yatekereje ko ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
He sits well.	Yicaye neza.
Getting more.	Kubona kandi byinshi.
Maybe he can regain his faith.	Ahari arashobora kongera kwizera.
Maybe get what you like.	Ahari kubona ibyo ukunda.
He was my son.	Yari umuhungu wanjye.
You have to think again.	Ugomba kongera gutekereza.
But you didn't.	Ariko ntabwo wabikoze.
He chose to leave.	Yahisemo kugenda.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
It was a lot, it was a lot.	Byari byinshi, byari byinshi.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
It’s the same with thinking.	Ni kimwe no gutekereza.
We can do nothing.	Ntacyo dushobora gukora.
We have to play well.	Tugomba gukina neza.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
There is only this.	Hariho ibi gusa.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
But that is exactly what he wanted.	Ariko ibyo biragaragara ko aribyo yashakaga.
When in fact they were not.	Mugihe mubyukuri ntabwo bari.
We have to let go of fear.	Tugomba kureka ubwoba.
He thought so.	Yatekereje ko ari byo.
If anything, he seems to be more scared than ever.	Niba hari icyo, asa naho afite ubwoba kuruta mbere.
You can cancel the program at any time.	Urashobora guhagarika gahunda igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Nzi neza ko atari byo.
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
One book to get.	Igitabo kimwe cyo kubona.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza rwose.
Take a good, long look.	Kureba neza, kure.
Honestly, he didn’t need it now.	Nyamuneka, ntabwo yari akeneye ubu.
He is not a boy.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu.
That would be a good thing for me.	Byaba ari ikintu cyiza kuri njye.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He was a man like him.	Yari umuntu nka we.
He was looking for something he could do on his own.	Yashakaga ikintu yashoboraga gukora wenyine.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
And, of course, that's exactly what happened.	Kandi, mubyukuri, nibyo rwose.
You have to have a car.	Ugomba kugira imodoka.
Me too.	Nanjye.
He was sitting on the floor.	Yari yicaye hasi.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
In him they were very high.	Muri we bari hejuru cyane.
Good friends	Inshuti nziza.
But that was difficult.	Ariko ibyo byari bigoye.
But there is help.	Ariko hariho ubufasha.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Or just.	Cyangwa gusa.
He had to go now.	Yagombaga kugenda ubu.
In fact he was.	Mubyukuri yari.
But he chose to try.	Ariko yahisemo kugerageza.
Right here.	Kuri aha.
She has children.	Afite abana.
Things are right.	Ibintu nibyo.
I think you need to talk to someone.	Ntekereza ko ukeneye kuvugana numuntu.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
It works well and well.	Akora neza kandi neza.
I knew nothing about this.	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri ibi.
He said it would go away.	Yavuze ko byari kugenda.
But you don’t have to do that.	Ariko ntugomba kubikora.
It was just a matter of time.	Nkaho byari ikibazo gusa.
But that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
It will be much harder than that.	Bizaba bigoye cyane kuruta ibyo.
It was hard to imagine.	Kubona byari bigoye gutekereza.
Everything was up.	Ibintu byose byari hejuru.
That would be enough.	Ibyo byaba bihagije.
They are here.	Bari hano.
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
Not at all, but definitely for him.	Ntabwo ari kuri byose, ariko rwose kuri we.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
Nothing wrong, nothing wrong.	Nta kibi, nta kibi.
He took a job.	Yafashe akazi.
I want to do it all.	Ndashaka kubikora byose.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You want so much.	Ushaka cyane.
I don't know who he is.	Sinzi uwo ari we.
And that's not all.	Kandi ibyo sibyo byose.
I can't do what you do.	Sinshobora gukora ibyo ukora.
Maybe we were.	Birashoboka ko twari.
It's just you and me.	Ni wowe na njye gusa.
I didn't know until later.	Ntabwo nari nzi kugeza nyuma.
And time is of the essence.	Kandi igihe ni cyiza.
He thought so.	Yatekereje ko ari byo.
The best he can do.	Nibyiza ashobora gukora.
It was his chance.	Byari amahirwe ye.
You said enough now.	Wavuze bihagije kuri ubu.
That would do it.	Ibyo byari kubikora.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
He was a good kid, a good kid.	Yari umwana mwiza, umwana mwiza.
That's when I heard.	Icyo gihe numvise.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He is not my son.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu wanjye.
Not much to see.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo kubona.
Money is not there.	Amafaranga ntabwo ahari.
It seems.	Birasa.
Or look.	Cyangwa kureba.
But it is too much.	Ariko ni byinshi cyane.
Just one of the many.	Umwe gusa muri benshi.
This is true.	Ibi nibyo.
He had to stop this.	Yagombaga guhagarika ibi.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
Good advice here.	Inama nziza hano.
I'm not behind you.	Ntabwo ndi inyuma yawe.
You can communicate well.	Urashobora kuvugana nawe neza.
Question.	Ikibazo.
I really enjoyed playing with him.	Nishimiye rwose gukina na we.
He had nothing wrong with that.	Ntabwo yari afite ikintu kibi.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
He works all the time.	Akora igihe cyose.
I think that's what it is.	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
It's not easy, either.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye, ahari.
He desperately needed time for her.	Yari akeneye umwanya kuri we cyane.
All in all, a good day.	Muri byose, umunsi mwiza.
He thought of everything.	Yatekereje kuri byose.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I mean, that.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko.
That's not what he wanted.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga.
All of that.	Ibyo byose.
You can't be bad.	Ntushobora kuba mubi.
Very good stuff.	Ibintu byiza cyane.
He never thought of asking for money.	Ntiyigeze atekereza no gusaba amafaranga.
He had to get out of this.	Yagombaga kuva muri ibi.
He thought every day.	Yatekerezaga buri munsi.
Above all.	Hejuru ya byose.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
She is just a girl.	Ni umukobwa gusa.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
You are who you are.	Uri uwo uri we.
Or, most likely, he never thought.	Cyangwa, birashoboka cyane ko atigeze atekereza na gato.
They have a way of transporting people.	Bafite uburyo bwo gutwara abantu.
It was not his idea.	Ntabwo yari igitekerezo cye.
He wanted to know.	Yashakaga kumenya.
Most of it is not.	Byinshi muri byo ntabwo.
Each of us.	Buri wese muri twe.
It was a sight to behold.	Byari ibintu byo kureba.
Eventually, he got what he wanted.	Amaherezo, yabonye icyo yashakaga.
I don’t have a car to do anything.	Ntabwo mfite imodoka yo gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I'm like him.	Ndi nka we.
I mean,.	Ndashaka kuvuga kubyo ,.
He said he felt good.	Yavuze ko yumva neza.
I think so badly.	Ndatekereza nabi cyane.
Just driving.	Gutwara gusa.
He is one.	Ni umwe.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
He took the money.	Yafashe amafaranga.
It would be alone.	Byaba wenyine.
He tried everything.	Yagerageje byose.
He didn't want to look.	Ntiyashakaga kureba.
But he did nothing good.	Ariko nta cyiza yari yakoze.
Once at home.	Rimwe murugo.
You are his friend.	Uri inshuti ye.
All we have today.	Ibyo dufite byose uyu munsi.
He should not have waited for anything else.	Ntabwo yari akwiye gutegereza ikindi kintu.
But also close.	Ariko kandi hafi.
That was his favorite.	Ibyo byari ibyo akunda.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
They have a lot to learn.	Bafite byinshi byo kwiga.
I want a lot of things.	Ndashaka ibintu byinshi.
But now they are a family.	Ariko ubu bari umuryango.
It’s not easy to take.	Ntabwo byoroshye gufata.
The woman knew a lot.	Umugore yari azi byinshi.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
What he had to do.	Icyo yagombaga gukora.
I think that's exactly what happened.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ibintu rwose.
He did not want to do that.	Ntiyashakaga kubikora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I am working.	Ndimo gukora.
You know where you're going.	Uzi aho ugiye.
He had none.	Nta n'umwe yari afite.
I have a house.	Mfite inzu.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba hano.
But that was far from over.	Ariko ibyo byari kure cyane.
He wanted out, away from her.	Yashakaga hanze, kure ye.
I want to be a guy.	Ndashaka kuba umusore.
But he knows he has the truth.	Ariko azi ko afite ukuri.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
But if this is not you, that's fine.	Ariko niba uyu atari wowe, nibyiza.
Do it tomorrow.	Kubikora ejo.
But they had.	Ariko bari bafite.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
All day and at home.	Umunsi wose kandi murugo.
He is.	Niwe.
I also want to give up.	Nanjye ndashaka kureka.
He didn’t want to think about why.	Ntabwo yashakaga gutekereza ku mpamvu.
He finally got a chance.	Amaherezo yagize amahirwe.
She loves school.	Akunda ishuri.
That's all right.	Nibyiza byose.
That's not what he thinks.	Ntabwo ari uko atekereza.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I can buy that.	Nshobora kugura ibyo.
There were not many in the house.	Ntabwo bari benshi murugo.
She is very home.	Ari murugo cyane.
I think the same today.	Ndatekereza kimwe uyu munsi.
He really bought it.	Yaguze rwose.
Everything will be fine.	Ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
Inside is a door.	Imbere hari umuryango.
Man, he did that good.	Muntu, yakoze ibyo byiza.
It will not be a big deal.	Ntabwo bizaba ikibazo kinini.
And of course, they were.	Kandi ni ukuri, bari.
Can't find the car.	Ntashobora kubona imodoka.
He was an actor.	Yari umukinnyi.
He thought they were scared.	Yatekereje ko bafite ubwoba.
Just for now.	Gusa kuri ubu.
He could not live in that.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kubaho muri ibyo.
And it's all your fault.	Kandi byose ni amakosa yawe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza ko agenda.
This is not good enough.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
I have that.	Mfite ibyo.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
He didn’t have much to look at.	Ntabwo yari afite byinshi byo kureba.
Maybe, something else.	Ahari, ikindi kintu.
He was not bad.	Ntabwo yari mubi.
And you really don't think so.	Kandi rwose ntabwo utekereza.
But it is a problem.	Ariko ni ikibazo.
It was a good car.	Yari imodoka nziza.
He was wearing his clothes.	Yari yambaye imyenda ye.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko aribyo.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He can take people.	Arashobora kujyana abantu.
It's good inside.	Nibyiza imbere.
It's all the same.	Byose birasa.
And that's not really the case.	Kandi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I feel scared.	Numva mfite ubwoba.
He never thought.	Ntiyigeze atekereza.
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
I guess, you know how to do this.	Ndakeka yuko, uzi gukora ibi.
I love everything he does.	Nkunda ibyo akora byose.
You were not at fault.	Ntabwo wari ufite amakosa.
I never saw anything.	Ntacyo nigeze mbona.
That's right.	Nibyo.
People are.	Abantu ni.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
She was hairy.	Yari umusatsi.
But this is not the case here.	Ariko iki ntabwo aricyo kibazo hano.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ibintu gusa.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's what my man did here.	Nibyo umuntu wanjye yakoze hano.
I really wanted a girl.	Nashakaga rwose umukobwa.
That or that, that or that.	Ibyo cyangwa cyangwa, ibyo cyangwa cyangwa.
They have the best.	Nibyiza bafite.
They are good friends.	Ni inshuti nziza.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
But my car.	Ariko imodoka yanjye.
I have another problem.	Mfite ikindi kibazo.
All the best.	Ibintu byiza byose.
Stop telling me.	Reka kumbwira.
With you on this.	Hamwe nawe kuri ibi.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He is a young child.	Ni umwana muto.
Really, really.	Nukuri, mubyukuri.
He did not know why he had to say anything.	Ntiyari azi impamvu yagombaga kugira icyo avuga.
I think that's what it is.	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo.
But he was lucky.	Ariko yagize amahirwe.
That's exactly what he needed.	Nukuri ibyo yari akeneye.
He was very happy to win.	Yishimiye cyane gutsinda.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo aricyo.
It was not always.	Ntabwo byari buri gihe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
They have.	Bafite.
There is another problem.	Hariho ikindi kibazo.
There is a reason.	Hariho impamvu.
He was completely alone.	Yari wenyine rwose.
It was not good for the film.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri firime.
I need to work on this.	Nkeneye gukora kuri ibi.
He came soon.	Yaje vuba.
We don't need it here.	Ntabwo dukeneye hano.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
That's what he does.	Nibyo akora.
I wanted to too.	Nanjye nashakaga.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
In fact, his problem is his wife.	Mubyukuri, ikibazo cye ni umugore we.
Everyone needs one.	Umuntu wese akeneye umwe.
Let it all go.	Kureka byose.
All he asked for was money.	Ibyo yasabye byari amafaranga gusa.
It was really good for us.	Byari byiza rwose kuri twe.
He had no idea.	Ntacyo yatekereje.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
Not only do they have a plan.	Ntabwo gusa bafite gahunda.
I just wasn’t in it, actually.	Gusa ntabwo nari ndimo, mubyukuri.
Making money.	Kubona amafaranga.
It started.	Yatangiye.
And he was there.	Kandi yari ahari.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
This is very similar.	Ibi birasa cyane.
I feel scared for no reason.	Ndumva mfite ubwoba nta mpamvu.
But the idea.	Ariko igitekerezo.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I'm going to a meeting.	Ngiye mu nama.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari ikintu cyiza atari hano.
I can be whatever you want.	Nshobora kuba icyo ushaka cyose.
And it is absolutely possible.	Kandi birashoboka rwose.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
I didn't know what to do before.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora mbere.
I didn't know he could do it.	Sinari nzi ko ashobora kubikora.
So far I don't know if we can do that.	Kugeza ubu sinzi niba dushobora kubikora.
He just tried to help.	Yagerageje gusa gufasha.
I think he is right.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri.
This is obviously not the case.	Ibi biragaragara ko atabikoze.
You can always see it nearby.	Urashobora buri gihe kubona hafi.
Why? 	Kuki?
That's good.	Nibyiza.
His father did not want to leave.	Se ntiyashakaga kugenda.
I have that too.	Nanjye mfite ibyo.
That you want to be.	Ko ushaka kuba.
But there is no telling. '	Ariko nta kubwira '.
It's not his phone.	Ntabwo ari terefone ye.
I'm really scared, if you want to know the truth.	Mfite ubwoba rwose, niba ushaka kumenya ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
We have people.	Dufite abantu.
This time however.	Iki gihe ariko.
He asked to take only one of them.	Yasabye gufata kimwe gusa muri byo.
Kinini.	Kinini.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza kuri ibyo.
No one did it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze.
It's a long time.	Ni igihe kirekire.
They both knew it was going to work.	Bombi bari bazi ko aribyo yari gukora.
Too much.	Kuri cyane.
It was almost as if he was scared.	Hafi nkaho yari afite ubwoba.
He must be thinking things through.	Agomba kuba atekereza ibintu.
I had time.	Nari mfite igihe.
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane, mwiza cyane.
That's right- this is not about me. 	Ntabwo aribyo, nyamuneka sibyo!
.	.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
Just smart.	Gusa ubwenge.
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.
We have a child.	Dufite umwana.
I know you have.	Nzi ko ufite.
It’s also good to watch.	Nibyiza kandi kureba.
I know what.	Nzi icyo.
For him his luck came later.	Kuri we amahirwe ye yaje nyuma.
I can take anyone.	Nshobora gufata umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Behind you	Inyuma yawe.
I had it now.	Nari mfite ubu.
He wanted to drink.	Yashakaga kunywa.
The family got it all.	Umuryango wabonye byose.
You really have to know what it is.	Ugomba rwose kumenya icyo aricyo.
If you don't want to be alone.	Niba udashaka kuba umwe wenyine.
It will be a party in me.	Bizaba ibirori muri njye.
The best we can do for people.	Nibyiza cyane dushobora gukora abantu.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho amahirwe menshi cyane.
There is no reason to live.	Nta mpamvu yo kubaho.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Everything was great.	Byose byari byiza cyane.
You can't trust anyone.	Ntushobora kwizera umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I can't have that, right.	Ntabwo nshobora kugira ibyo, sibyo.
He is a good person in everything.	Ni umuntu mwiza muri byose.
He is a very bad person.	Ni umuntu mubi cyane.
I'm not lucky.	Ntabwo mfite amahirwe.
I'm going home.	Ngiye gutaha.
You can make money with us.	Urashobora kubona amafaranga natwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
None of this can be seen.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ushobora kubona.
It looks like he saw the same thing.	Birasa nkaho yabonye kimwe.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I can do nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora.
They were under me.	Bari munsi yanjye.
Really, really.	Nukuri, rwose.
His wife.	Umugore we.
This is not an idea.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
You are taking.	Urimo gufata.
You need years.	Ukeneye imyaka.
I mean, that’s not it.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo aribyo.
Or maybe it's not him.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari we.
It was good though.	Byari byiza ariko.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Or maybe not at all.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari rwose.
I'm sorry he was here.	Mbabajwe nuko yari hano rwose.
Beautiful house.	Inzu nziza.
We need wisdom, we need to find his friend.	Dukeneye ubwenge, dukeneye gushaka inshuti ye.
He needed to think things through on his own.	Yari akeneye gutekereza ibintu wenyine.
Talk to you soon.	Kuvugana nawe.
I'm upstairs.	Ndi hejuru.
He did not do well.	Ntiyigeze akora neza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
By driving people well.	Mu gutwara abantu neza.
None of us knew what to do.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari uzi icyo gukora.
You know why you're here.	Uzi impamvu uri hano.
Maybe another time.	Ahari ikindi gihe.
In this case.	Mugihe ibi.
And that’s what his family thought.	Kandi ni umuryango we yatekerezaga.
It's something.	Ni ikintu.
And it would work.	Kandi byari gukora.
I would not eat.	Ntabwo nari kurya.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
What did he say?	Yavuze ko ari iki?
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
My car too.	Nanjye imodoka yanjye.
It is very good and simple.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byoroshye.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
There is a good feeling that the party went wrong.	Hariho kumva neza ibirori byagenze nabi.
We are just on schedule now.	Ubu turi kuri gahunda gusa.
Nothing wrong.	Nta kibi.
We are very high here.	Turi hejuru cyane hano.
There is work to be done tomorrow.	Hariho akazi ko gukora ejo.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
And it's really good.	Kandi ni mwiza rwose.
Soon.	Vuba.
But this is the last time.	Ariko ubu ni bwo bwa nyuma.
Book, book, book.	Igitabo, igitabo, igitabo.
Anyone could just buy.	Umuntu wese yashoboraga kugura gusa.
He took his time.	Yafashe igihe cye.
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
He went away from me.	Yagiye kure yanjye.
Be smart.	Kugira ubwenge.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It would be difficult.	Byaba bigoye.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
No need to try.	Nta mpamvu yo kugerageza.
Only me and I.	Gusa njye ndi njye.
He is here in us.	Ari hano muri twe.
Maybe a day.	Ahari umunsi.
You can't do anything else.	Ntushobora gukora ikindi.
I wanted him to do it.	Nashakaga ko abikora.
But never today.	Ariko nta na rimwe muri iki gihe.
And it was a day.	Kandi wari umunsi.
He said he had.	Yavuze ko afite.
But he had nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
I did not know who.	Sinari nzi uwo.
I hope you can too.	Ndizera ko nawe ushobora.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
You should never do that.	Ntugomba na rimwe kubikora.
Probably not far away.	Birashoboka ko atari kure.
I never saw much about him.	Sinigeze mbona byinshi kuri we.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
And that will happen.	Kandi ibyo bizaba.
Take care.	Gufata neza.
It was a small day.	Wari umunsi muto.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
But he chose to be early.	Ariko yahisemo kuba kare.
Why? 	Kuki?
We can't stay here.	Ntidushobora kuguma hano.
He seemed worried.	Yasaga naho afite impungenge.
That is also true.	Ibyo na byo ni ukuri.
That is obviously not true.	Ibyo biragaragara ko atari ukuri.
This was a man who could believe.	Uyu yari umuntu yashoboraga kwizera.
Everyone can work without it.	Abantu buri wese ashobora gukora adafite.
I wanted him to have something to say, anything.	Nashakaga ko agira icyo avuga, ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
There is something wrong with that.	Hariho ikintu kibi kuri yo.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
He had.	Yari afite.
There is always a lot of money.	Buri gihe hariho amafaranga menshi.
Being something.	Kuba ikintu.
You don’t have to wait long.	Ntugomba gutegereza igihe kirekire.
However, there is another problem.	Ariko, hariho ikindi kibazo.
Bottom line.	Hasi hasi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
We are really bad.	Turi mubi rwose.
Time is short.	Igihe ni gito.
He could see why.	Yashoboraga kubona impamvu.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
This is a good time.	Ubu ni igihe cyiza.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, ni byiza rwose.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
You are bad.	Uri mubi.
Upstairs there is a door.	Hejuru hari umuryango.
I have to talk to someone.	Ngomba kuvugana n'umuntu.
When he was his best friend.	Iyo yari inshuti ye nziza.
Your family is behind you.	Umuryango wawe uri inyuma yawe.
I know what you mean.	Nzi ibyo ushaka kuvuga.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He was alone.	Yari muri we wenyine.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
We need to talk to you.	Tugomba kuvugana nawe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza cyane.
Either way, it's bad.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ni mubi.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
Not before, not since.	Ntabwo mbere, ntabwo kuva.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
He had no one.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari afite.
And very much.	Kandi cyane.
Or, maybe they were.	Cyangwa, birashoboka ko bari.
That is absolutely true.	Ibyo ni ukuri rwose.
Question.	Ikibazo.
That’s a really good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza rwose.
She was not a woman to him.	Ntiyari umugore kuri we.
Normal learning.	Kwiga bisanzwe.
I thought about it all.	Natekereje kuri byose.
Only.	Gusa.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
In other cases, it is possible.	Ikindi gihe, birashoboka.
We have no time.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya.
It's good outside.	Nibyiza hanze.
He had no time.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya.
Her clothes were very nice.	Imyenda ye yari nziza cyane.
I am a teacher.	Ndi umwarimu.
This is absolutely true.	Ibi ni ukuri rwose.
Now everything was fine.	Ubu ibintu byose byari byiza.
You may have to think for a while.	Birashoboka ko ugomba gutekereza igihe gito.
Almost everything.	Hafi ya byose.
But today he is stepping back.	Ariko uyu munsi arimo gusubira inyuma.
Everything was too much.	Ibintu byose byari byinshi cyane.
He is a very good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza rwose.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
What he did, is very possible.	Ibyo yabikoze, birashoboka cyane.
I really don't think so.	Ndizera rwose ko atari byo.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
I enjoyed this week.	Nishimiye iki cyumweru.
You are scared.	Ufite ubwoba.
We all have.	Twese dufite.
That is not true of me.	Ntabwo ari ukuri kuri njye.
Treat as much as possible.	Gufata nkuko bishoboka.
I think about everything.	Ntekereza kuri byose.
There is something you do.	Hariho ikintu ukora.
You can do any problem.	Urashobora gukora ikibazo icyo aricyo cyose.
But obviously not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari byo.
Well, that was good enough.	Nibyo, byari byiza bihagije.
I think about this.	Ntekereza kuri ibi.
You saw.	Wabonye.
And they were on the phone just then.	Kandi bari terefone icyo gihe gusa.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
He was here.	Hano yari.
I'm sure it will.	Nzi neza ko bizaba.
It’s not just easy, easy, or good.	Ntabwo byoroshye gusa, byoroshye, cyangwa neza.
It's good to have you here.	Nibyiza kuba ufite hano.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu yabonye.
It is very good and good.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byiza.
It's you.	Aba niwowe.
He never thought.	Ntiyigeze atekereza.
And that's not all.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo byose.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
I need a little time.	Nkeneye igihe gito.
One	Umwe
He hadn't been gone recently.	Nta vuba aha yari yagiye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
By then, you are studying well.	Icyo gihe, urimo kwiga neza.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
Why are you here.	Impamvu uri hano.
She is his daughter.	Ni umukobwa we.
We have to live together.	Tugomba kubana.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo sibyo rwose.
It was just scary.	Byari ubwoba gusa.
He is here to help.	Ari hano gufasha.
And it's time.	Kandi ni igihe.
I do the same thing.	Nkora ikintu kimwe.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje kuri icyo kibazo.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Ntacyo nashakaga kuvuga.
But it would not be here.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuba hano.
That's right, this is just a movie.	Nibyo, ni firime gusa.
We have to have that.	Tugomba kugira ibyo.
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.
He was still very far away.	Yari akiri kure cyane.
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
You can go now.	Urashobora kugenda ubu.
He wanted it for a long time.	Yashakaga igihe kirekire.
But it is not very easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga ko.
She did not know where her son had gone.	Ntiyari azi aho umuhungu we yagiye.
I really want to do more.	Ndashaka rwose gukora ibintu byinshi.
And that's all there is to it.	Kandi ibyo aribyo byose kugeza ubu.
One really needs to know something.	Nukuri umuntu agomba kumenya ikintu.
She is not very girl, but she is not a boy.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa cyane, ariko ntabwo ari umuhungu.
But it is big.	Ariko ni kinini.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Eating too much.	Kurya cyane.
She is happy to be alone.	Yishimiye kuba wenyine.
He was right, as usual.	Yaba afite ukuri, nkuko bisanzwe.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
Only.	Gusa.
I think you are a good person.	Ntekereza ko uri umuntu mwiza.
No room at all.	Nta cyumba rwose.
Ngomba.	Ngomba.
I like something very much.	Nkunda ikintu cyane.
I am a bad person.	Ndi umuntu mubi.
I am very happy to buy.	Nishimiye cyane kugura.
Now is the time to play.	Ubu ni igihe cyo gukina.
Maybe you can do things better.	Birashoboka ko ushobora gukora ibintu neza.
Being really far away would be far away.	Kuba kure rwose rwose byaba ari kure.
He wants to be clear.	Arashaka kuvuga neza.
We can't ask for more.	Ntidushobora gusaba byinshi.
He is a dog.	Ni imbwa.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
Not your player.	Ntabwo ari umukinnyi wawe.
He said it is likely to happen this week.	Yavuze ko bishoboka ko bizaba muri iki cyumweru.
He had that.	Yari afite ibyo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, mubyukuri sibyo.
He had to do it alone.	Yagombaga kubikora wenyine.
I love that you love me too.	Nkunda ko nawe ukunda.
You did it.	Wabikoze.
There is no truth.	Nta kuri.
And he didn't need to.	Kandi ntiyari akeneye.
You got it right.	Wabonye neza.
How can you.	Nigute ushobora.
You have to go now.	Ugomba kugenda ubu.
Well, we have and we don't have.	Nibyiza, dufite kandi ntabwo dufite.
You are not good or bad.	Ntabwo uri mwiza cyangwa mubi.
But this morning, something else happened.	Ariko muri iki gitondo cya kare, hari ikindi kintu.
And not a lot of money.	Kandi ntabwo ari amafaranga menshi.
Both were close by.	Bombi bari hafi na kure.
He looked closely at her.	Yarebye neza muri we.
We have to buy one of those.	Tugomba kugura kimwe muri ibyo.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
He didn't really know what time it was.	Ntabwo yari azi rwose igihe icyo aricyo.
He wanted it there.	Yashakaga aho.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And we can't.	Kandi ntidushobora.
No one is here.	Nta muntu uri hano.
He has a lot of talent.	Afite impano nyinshi.
Let your hair down.	Reka umusatsi wawe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ukuri gusa.
You can see, you can see something.	Urashobora kubona, ushobora kubona ikintu.
We have a lot of problems.	Dufite ibibazo byinshi.
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
He also has a good family.	Afite kandi umuryango mwiza.
I also make mistakes.	Nanjye nkora amakosa.
Seeing something else.	Kubona ikindi kintu.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
But there is one problem for him.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kimwe kuri we.
But that’s a good idea.	Ariko ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Na se.	Na se.
He got a little time.	Yabonye umwanya muto.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka.
It's all the same.	Byose ni kimwe.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo bisanzwe.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
I would do the same.	Nanjye nari kubikora.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
He lives here.	Aba hano.
More than anyone knew.	Kurenza umuntu uwo ari we wese yari azi.
That's really easy.	Nibyo rwose byoroshye.
Top clothes.	Imyenda yo hejuru.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
But that would be a mistake.	Ariko byaba ari amakosa.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I know it's not your fault.	Nzi ko atari amakosa yawe.
You can try it out.	Urashobora kugerageza kugerageza.
I don't know what to do.	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora.
But not this morning.	Ariko si muri iki gitondo.
However, it is not good.	Ariko, ntabwo ari byiza.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibi sibyo gusa.
I really wanted to try something else.	Nashakaga rwose kugerageza ikindi kintu.
It is never long.	Nta na rimwe ari igihe kirekire.
Good idea, but bad.	Igitekerezo cyiza, ariko gukora nabi.
He was not here or here.	Ntabwo yari hano cyangwa hano.
I saw it though.	Nabonye ariko.
We have a lot of that.	Dufite byinshi muri byo.
I didn't want anything.	Ntacyo nashakaga.
He never heard of anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze yumva.
I love it so much.	Nkunda cyane.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
He was not.	Ntiyari.
I really don't think so.	Ndatekereza cyane ko atari.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
You can't do things.	Ntushobora gukora ibintu.
He was not going to think.	Ntabwo yari agiye gutekereza.
It seems to be very low.	Asa naho ari hasi cyane.
There is time here.	Hano hari umwanya.
What he may be.	Icyo ashobora kuba cyo.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, birashoboka cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He can't speak.	Ntashobora kuvuga.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo gukora.
I really wanted to be out.	Nashakaga kuba hanze cyane.
I'm happy with the problem.	Nishimiye ikibazo.
He thought of everything.	Yatekereje kuri byose.
Or maybe he had high expectations.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari yiteze byinshi.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
Just a little thought.	Gusa igitekerezo gito.
At the time, we had nothing.	Icyo gihe, ntacyo twari dufite.
He should have been ahead.	Yari akwiye kuba imbere.
And it is my fault.	Kandi ni amakosa yanjye.
They were just friends.	Bari inshuti gusa.
He loved everything.	Yakundaga byose.
I was young.	Nari muto.
But that is always a mistake.	Ariko ibyo buri gihe ni amakosa.
I have to live with that.	Ngomba kubana nibyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
That's not what he meant.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga kuvuga.
The same goes for him.	Ibyo birasa na we.
He thought it wasn’t much.	Yatekereje ko atari byinshi.
I have a problem, however.	Mfite ikibazo, ariko.
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza kuri ibyo.
The food was simple and easy.	Ibiryo byari byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
But it looked good.	Ariko yasaga neza.
I feel it all the time.	Ndumva buri gihe.
But he knew something.	Ariko hari icyo yari azi.
And maybe they had.	Kandi birashoboka ko bari bafite.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
If it's too easy, it's not good.	Niba byoroshye cyane, ntabwo ari byiza.
People are.	Abantu ni.
All of this is true.	Ibi byose ni ukuri.
I was a girl.	Nari umukobwa.
It is possible, however, that it is possible.	Birashoboka, ariko, birashoboka.
No one was down.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hasi.
You don't have to say that.	Ntugomba kuvuga gutya.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He did not ask.	Ntacyo yabajije.
And he went even further.	Kandi yagiye kure kuruta ibyo.
They have what they don’t have.	Bafite ibyo adafite.
He never felt afraid.	Ntiyigeze yumva ubwoba.
He had a lot of plans.	Yari afite gahunda nyinshi.
He asked if anyone wanted to go back.	Yabajije niba hari ushaka gusubira inyuma.
You should never do that.	Ntugomba kubikora na gato.
After all, things are true.	Nyuma ya byose, ibintu ni ukuri.
The problem is the same.	Ikibazo ni kimwe.
This was his place.	Uyu wari umwanya we.
Only one did.	Umwe gusa ni we wabikoze.
I never thought of one of those.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri kimwe muri ibyo.
That he would go.	Ko yari kugenda.
I am a lucky person.	Ndi umuntu ufite amahirwe.
He was well aware that everything.	Yari azi neza ko byose.
Someone knows something.	Umuntu azi ikintu.
But he wanted more.	Ariko yashakaga byinshi.
Not very good.	Nta cyiza cyane.
It's all my fault.	Byose ni amakosa yanjye.
He needed time to learn what they had.	Yari akeneye umwanya wo kwiga ibyo bafite.
It's close to you.	Ari hafi yawe.
But he saw nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
The reason for having a phone.	Impamvu yo kugira na terefone.
He said that was good for him.	Yavuze ko ibyo ari byiza kuri we.
He needed a lot of time.	Yari akeneye igihe kinini.
There was one young man.	Hari umusore umwe.
I didn't have to go.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kugenda.
In that room, there was nothing.	Muri icyo cyumba, nta kintu na kimwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
This is his place.	Aha ni umwanya we.
I may be close.	Nshobora kuba hafi.
But he has problems.	Ariko afite ibibazo.
We don’t have too many, it’s true.	Ntabwo dufite benshi cyane, ni ukuri.
At that point, he decided to go home.	Icyo gihe, yahisemo gutaha.
Or anything.	Cyangwa ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
And this is a problem for us.	Kandi ibi ni ibibazo kuri twe.
But this is good for me.	Ariko ibi ni byiza kuri njye.
I can't stop that.	Sinshobora guhagarika ibyo.
And they would do it again.	Kandi bari kongera kubikora.
You were scared.	Wari ufite ubwoba.
He tried to grab it.	Yagerageje gufata.
I don't know what it is.	Ntazi icyo aricyo.
Everyone knows someone who knows someone.	Abantu bose bazi umuntu uzi umuntu.
It's a job.	Ni akazi.
I would know, if they have.	Nari kumenya, niba bafite.
They were scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba.
She is my favorite.	Niwe nkunda cyane.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibyo ni byo rwose.
But there are problems.	Ariko hariho ibibazo.
He was not young.	Ntiyari akiri muto.
It's time too.	Ni igihe kandi.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
Either way, you have to come.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ugomba kuza.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Eat alone tonight.	Kurya wenyine muri iri joro.
When he does.	Iyo akora.
But that’s not a big deal.	Ariko ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
This is good.	Ubu ni byiza.
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
That someone here needs a lot of help.	Ko umuntu hano akeneye ubufasha cyane.
But the last thing.	Ariko ikintu cya nyuma.
That's all he does, yo.	Nibyo akora gusa, yo.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
But you can't have everything.	Ariko ntushobora kugira byose.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
This is not always the case.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari impamvu nziza.
You can only do so if you have a gift.	Urashobora kubikora gusa niba ufite impano.
He was close.	Yari hafi.
I can walk.	Nshobora kugenda.
From where he is, he can see everything.	Kuva aho ari, arashobora kubona byose.
It was not a good idea.	Ntabwo byari igitekerezo cyiza.
And, that's right.	Kandi, nibyo.
He is finally scared.	Amaherezo afite ubwoba.
When he was in prison.	Igihe yari muri gereza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I had the same problem before.	Nagize ikibazo kimwe mbere.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ntabwo byagenze gutya.
I don't see what you mean.	Ntabwo mbona icyo ushaka kuvuga.
I want you to be my wife.	Ndashaka ko uri umugore wanjye.
He was also on one.	Na we yari kuri umwe.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
What did he ask?	Yabajije iki?
That's right.	Ibyo aribyo.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
Soon.	Vuba.
His father was a teacher.	Se yari umwarimu.
Doing so is sometimes good.	Kubikora rimwe na rimwe ni byiza.
He had come to her, not her.	Yari yaje aho ari, atari we kuri we.
Everyone has a reason.	Umuntu wese afite impamvu.
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
Back home.	Gusubira murugo.
Or take care.	Cyangwa no gufata neza.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
It was a great gift for us.	Byari impano nziza kuri twe.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari amakosa.
He wanted to talk to everyone.	Yashakaga kuvuga kuri bose.
But he had to do it.	Ariko yagombaga kubikora.
However, it seems to be very good that it is not true.	Ariko, birasa nkaho ari byiza cyane kuba atari ukuri.
And that's right you can now become known as a Lord of the Rings!	Kandi nibyo niba ufite amahirwe menshi.
He did it well.	Yabikoze neza.
No one is above you.	Nta muntu uri hejuru yawe.
He had a school today.	Uyu munsi yari afite ishuri.
We were.	Twari.

It will be better now.	Bizaba byiza ubu.
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
He is the best friend we have.	Ni inshuti nziza dufite.
He has.	Afite.
That's a bad idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo kibi.
It was all he could think of.	Byari byose yashoboraga gutekereza.
I mean, really, really easy.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri, byoroshye rwose.
I want to take a good look.	Ndashaka kureba neza.
None of us needed or wanted money.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari ukeneye cyangwa ushaka amafaranga.
I feel right.	Numva ari ukuri.
And he said he didn't know why.	Kandi yavuze ko atazi impamvu.
But nothing wrong, nothing wrong.	Ariko nta kibi, nta kibi.
Probably not much.	Birashoboka ko atari byinshi.
He does everything on time.	Akora ibintu byose ku gihe.
But this was normal.	Ariko ibi byari bisanzwe.
.	.
You can get help.	Urashobora kubona ubufasha.
Fear in it.	Ubwoba muri bwo.
I never got the chance.	Sinigeze mbona amahirwe.
He saw something in me.	Yabonye ikintu muri njye.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
He loved everything.	Yakundaga byose.
I know you want to help.	Nzi ko ushaka gufasha.
He was not just one person.	Ntiyari umuntu umwe gusa.

It was not my fault.	Ntabwo byari amakosa yanjye.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
All is well !.	Byose nibyiza!.
It's early.	Ndi kare.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
Especially from a great distance.	Cyane cyane kuva kure cyane.
And it’s not a house.	Kandi ntabwo ari inzu.
There is nothing of his father in him.	Nta kintu na kimwe cya se muri we.
Not good for me.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
One cannot ask for more.	Umuntu ntashobora gusaba byinshi.
From i.	Kuva i.
I actually saw it today.	Nabonye uyu munsi mubyukuri.
And you look good.	Kandi usa neza.
It's very clear here.	Biragaragara cyane hano.
They don't know for sure.	Ntabwo bazi neza.
He doesn’t want to talk about food.	Ntabwo ashaka kuvuga ibiryo.
He got his chance.	Yabonye amahirwe ye.
But obviously.	Ariko biragaragara.
And it’s not very good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
He was not present at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yari ahari.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
He acknowledged that their numbers were not enough to defeat Lukashenko's government.	Yemeye ko bishoboka cyane.
It was good and good.	Byari byiza kandi byiza.
Maybe not tonight, but in the end.	Birashoboka ko atari iri joro, ariko amaherezo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You know what you're doing wrong.	Uzi ibyo ukora nabi.
He had a place.	Umwanya yari afite.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
He works alone.	Akora wenyine.
They knew he was out.	Bari bazi ko ari hanze.
A lot of things are good.	Ibintu byinshi nibyiza.
And one was inside.	Kandi umwe yari imbere.
There is a chance for him to get things right.	Hariho amahirwe ye yo kubona ibintu neza.
He saw something else.	Yabonye ikindi kintu.
Someone who thinks a lot.	Umuntu utekereza cyane.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
One hair.	Umusatsi umwe.
There are good things.	Hariho ibintu byiza.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
Not good for everyone.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri buri wese.
As if.	Nkaho .
It was a long time coming.	Byari igihe kirekire cyo kuza.
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
That was not the case.	Ntabwo byari ibyo.
You have to do it right.	Ugomba kubikora neza.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
And no one would eat.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wari kurya.
I think he wants both.	Ndatekereza ko yifuza bombi.
Today, he is right.	Uyu munsi, afite ukuri.
I know what to do.	Nzi icyo ari cyo gukora.
It's beautiful here.	Ni mwiza hano.
But he would have nothing.	Ariko nta na kimwe yari kugira.
He looked frightened.	Yarebye afite ubwoba.
Good luck to everyone !.	Amahirwe kuri bose!.
Apparently it happened.	Biragaragara ko byagenze.
Something I thought about.	Hari ikintu natekereje.
He is at home.	Ari murugo.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
Seeing what it is.	Kubona icyo aricyo.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora kuri ibyo.
In fact you.	Mubyukuri nawe.
That's not the only idea.	Icyo ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa.
He was just far from me.	Yari kure yanjye gusa.
I'm glad you can come.	Nishimiye ko ushobora kuza.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yari afite ubwoba.
He wants to go back to the room.	Arashaka gusubira mu cyumba.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I never believed.	Sinigeze nizera.
One for his father.	Umwe kuri se.
He didn't have to live.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubaho.
That is not the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
My luck.	Amahirwe yanjye.
He told me for the last time.	Yambwiye bwa nyuma.
His family has no father.	Umuryango we nta se.
I thought she was a woman.	Natekerezaga ko yaba umugore.
That was him.	Uwo yari we.
I want to be there for everything.	Ndashaka kuba ahari kuri byose.
You can help.	Urashobora gufasha.
Who knows why he didn't do it.	Ninde uzi impamvu atabikoze.
He knew what to do today.	Yari azi icyo agomba gukora uyu munsi.
He knew he wasn't.	Yari azi ko atari we.
The problem is me.	Ikibazo ni njye.
I found a lot of good things to study in, out here.	Nabonye byinshi byiza byo kwiga muri, hanze aha.
Too much to give up.	Byinshi cyane kureka.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza.
He will be behind.	Azaba inyuma.
This worked out a little better.	Ibi byagenze neza gato.
But it is possible that it was better.	Ariko birashoboka kandi birashoboka ko byari byiza kuruta.
He is doing it.	Arimo kubikora.
He is a very handsome young man.	Ni umusore mwiza cyane.
It would be.	Byaba.
It seems to be a mistake.	Birasa nkaho ari amakosa.
Things to see.	Ibintu byo kubona.
I want to be your friend again.	Ndashaka kongera kuba inshuti yawe.
I think he bought that.	Ntekereza ko yaguze ibyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
The money was not there.	Amafaranga ntabwo yari ahari.
I thought she was well dressed.	Natekereje ko yambaye neza.
I'm glad he is.	Nishimiye ko ari.
He was right about that.	Yari afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
He needed to move quickly.	Yari akeneye kugenda vuba.
We can't even walk.	Ntidushobora no kugenda.
At home, he chose.	Murugo, yahisemo.
You don't have to be here.	Ntagomba kuba hano.
But I am the only one.	Ariko ni njye wenyine.
I like to think.	Nkunda gutekereza.
It's good that he knows a lot.	Nibyiza kuba azi byinshi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He wanted out.	Yashakaga hanze.
He didn't like that.	Ntabwo yakundaga gutya.
He may be.	Ashobora kuba.
I just ask the question.	Ndabaza ikibazo gusa.
You have to think about doing it.	Ugomba gutekereza kubikora.
Someone had gone.	Umuntu yari yagiye.
Out front.	Hanze imbere.
I can't say what I think about this.	Sinshobora kuvuga icyo ntekereza kuri ibi.
The less time they had, the better.	Umwanya muto bari bafite, nibyiza.
He didn't even want to know.	Ntiyashakaga no kumenya.
I am at home now.	Ubu ndi murugo.
Talking behind my back.	Kuvuga inyuma yanjye.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
We were at home.	Twari murugo.
They know who you are.	Bazi uwo uri we.
I thought he would do it.	Natekereje ko azabikora.
You have to be bad.	Ugomba kuba mubi.
It was nothing but that.	Ntacyo yari cyo ariko.
He has to buy what he has to do.	Agomba kugura ibyo agomba gukora.
There is nothing you can do now.	Nta kintu ushobora gukora ubu.
If you don’t want this, that’s fine.	Niba udashaka ibi, nibyiza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni cyo kibazo rwose.
Why.	Impamvu.
He was right about that.	Yari afite ukuri muri ibyo.
In fact, it was a lot.	Mubyukuri, byari byinshi.
This time, soon.	Iki gihe, vuba.
He looked at her with a little thought.	Yarebye atekereza gato.
We have a house.	Dufite inzu.
But obviously you are.	Ariko biragaragara ko nawe uri.
They are worried.	Bafite impungenge.
'	'
I love my house.	Nkunda inzu yanjye.
He was well aware of this.	Muri ibyo yari azi neza.
He may be on his way to work.	Birashoboka ko agiye ku kazi.
This time it is not.	Iki gihe ntabwo.
Or was it something else.	Cyangwa byari ikindi kintu.
Anyone can do it.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
That's great.	Ni byiza cyane.
I didn't want help.	Sinifuzaga ubufasha.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
He was the one who had the truth.	Niwe yari afite ukuri.
Far from here.	Kure hano.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
Where he can't go back.	Aho adashobora gusubira.
Just seeing.	Kubona gusa.
He had one last thing to do.	Yari afite ikintu cya nyuma cyo gukora.
It was not a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo.
It's really good to do that.	Nibyiza rwose kubikora.
He needed to know better.	Yari akeneye kumenya neza.
He could have been here.	Yashoboraga kuba hano.
And that’s not good for each of us.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari byiza kuri buri wese muri twe.
I think he is here.	Ndakeka ko ari hano.
He was very dressed.	Yari yambaye cyane.
For him that was normal.	Kuri we ibyo byari bisanzwe.
He is the only one.	Ni we wenyine.
Let people where they are.	Reka abantu aho bari.
It is not the same time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kimwe.
You can't really do that.	Ntushobora rwose kubikora.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo rwose ari bose.
I don’t really want to do that.	Ntashaka cyane kubikora.
Once upon a time, it would be just me and myself.	Rimwe, byaba ari njye na njye gusa.
I can wait.	Nshobora gutegereza.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
At the time, he appeared to be very young.	Icyo gihe yasaga naho ari muto cyane.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
You bad	Wowe mubi.
It was much harder than that.	Byari bigoye cyane kurenza ibyo.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
I'm here if you need anything.	Ndi hano niba hari icyo ukeneye.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
No need to see.	Nta mpamvu yo kubona.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo.
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
There is a long time.	Hariho igihe kinini.
He was still very far away.	Yari akiri kure cyane.
You are a good boy.	Uri umuhungu mwiza.
I needed to read.	Nari nkeneye gusoma.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I really like it now.	Nkunda rwose ubu.
His clothes.	Imyenda ye.
Really good food.	Mubyukuri ibiryo byiza.
We are at all times.	Turi ku gihe cyose.
He is at work.	Ari ku kazi.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He was not sure if he could do it.	Ntabwo yari azi neza niba ashobora kubikora.
It wasn’t much to see.	Ntabwo byari byinshi kubona.
If it were me.	Iyo yaba ari njye.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Like you, in fact.	Kimwe nawe, mubyukuri.
Not once, maybe.	Ntabwo ari rimwe, birashoboka.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
You should not eat this.	Ntagomba kurya ibi.
But he had a reason.	Ariko yari afite impamvu.
That's exactly what I think.	Nibyo rwose ndakeka.
And let it be.	Reka kandi.
I hope so too.	Ndizera ko na we ari.
He thought he was.	Yatekereje ko ari we.
Buying is good.	Kugura ni byiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You have to look at people.	Ugomba kureba abantu.
I have to work on everything.	Ngomba gukora kuri buri kintu.
She is wearing a job.	Yambaye akazi.
We all have a lot of things.	Twese dufite ibintu byinshi.
He wanted so much.	Yashakaga cyane.
Looks like we all have the same problem.	Birasa nkaho twese dufite ikibazo kimwe.
He was still upstairs.	Yari akiri hejuru.
He needed to take it.	Yari akeneye gufata.
Maybe he was just scared.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ubwoba gusa.
Seizing his car.	Gufata imodoka ye.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
It looks very, very good.	Birasa cyane, neza.
But we are not cars.	Ariko ntabwo turi imodoka.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo kibi.
She may one day have her own children.	Birashoboka ko umunsi umwe yaba afite abana be wenyine.
Sometimes it’s a party.	Rimwe na rimwe ni ibirori.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He chose to play.	Yahisemo gukina.
I did nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nakoze.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
It was a great plan.	Byari gahunda nziza.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo yatekerezaga.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
No one on the outside knows it's here.	Nta muntu wo hanze uzi ko ari hano.
He was close to her.	Yari hafi ye.
The child was looking for something.	Umwana yashakaga ikintu.
I thought we could be friends again.	Natekereje ko dushobora kongera kuba inshuti.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
This is not a good idea.	Iyi ntabwo ari inama nziza.
I think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri.
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
We have very little time.	Dufite igihe gito cyane.
A little time.	Umwanya muto.
There is a lot to come.	Hariho byinshi byo kuza.
He meant this.	Yashakaga kuvuga ibi.
And we have a lot.	Kandi dufite byinshi.
I think that would be a good idea.	Ntekereza ko byaba ari igitekerezo cyiza.
The girl too.	Umukobwa na we.
He wanted her to go too.	Yashakaga ko na we agenda.
It is not for him.	Ntabwo ari kuri we.
He didn't want to be alone.	Ntiyashakaga wenyine.
But not all.	Ariko si bose.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
It is not a good plan.	Ntabwo ari gahunda nziza.
I don't know how to do it.	Sinzi uburyo bwo kubikora.
One must know the truth.	Umuntu agomba kumenya ukuri.
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
It was not good at all.	Ntabwo byari byiza na gato.
He tried to think.	Yagerageje gutekereza.
However, he did not.	Ariko, ntabwo yabikoze.
In fact, the young man is young.	Mubyukuri, umusore akiri muto.
The work is too early for that.	Akazi kare cyane kubyo.
In front of him.	Imbere ye.
It was nothing.	Ntacyo yari cyo.
Maybe a lot of things.	Ahari ibintu byinshi.
I like good things.	Nkunda ibintu byiza.
We just have to get more.	Tugomba gusa kubona byinshi.
If you are human.	Niba uri umuntu.
He was not sure what to do.	Ntiyari azi neza icyo gukora.
And every night.	Kandi buri joro.
But nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe.
Lots of opportunities.	Amahirwe menshi.
Well, it was really good.	Nibyo, byari byiza rwose.
It was very low.	Yari hasi cyane.
This is always true.	Buri gihe ni ukuri.
I think he can do it.	Ntekereza ko ashobora kubikora.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He agreed to do so.	Yemeye kubikora.
We are many.	Turi benshi.
There is a good life here.	Hano hari kubaho neza.
A little thing.	Ikintu gito.
Years are here.	Imyaka iri hano.
It's not hard to do.	Ntabwo bigoye gukora.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo ibyo ari byo.
Bad speech.	Kuvuga nabi.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
But he was not behind me.	Ariko ntabwo yari inyuma yanjye.
You have a problem.	Ufite ikibazo.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I can't carry a baby.	Ntabwo nshobora gutwara umwana.
Not as usual.	Ntabwo ari nkuko byari bisanzwe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa.
He is always your son.	Buri gihe aba umuhungu wawe.
And it wouldn’t take much.	Kandi ntabwo byari gufata byinshi.
He didn't have much to say about that.	Ntiyari afite byinshi byo kuvuga kuri ibyo.
We have a good idea of ​​where he is.	Dufite igitekerezo cyiza aho ari.
Quit.	Kureka.
You can be good with everything.	Urashobora kuba mwiza hamwe nibyo byose.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It would be great.	Byari kuba byiza rwose.
Not really good.	Ntabwo ari byiza rwose.
You know what you're doing.	Uzi icyo ukora.
There is now.	Hariho ubu.
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
However, this is not always a good thing.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo buri gihe ari ibintu byiza.
We are here.	Turi hano.
And, this is true.	Kandi, ibi ni ukuri.
I mean a lot.	Ndashaka kuvuga cyane.
He has to be close.	Agomba kuba hafi.
I hope you can do it.	Nizere ko ushobora kubikora.
You have to wait.	Ugomba gutegereza.
You can do as you wish.	Urashobora gukora uko ushaka.
It started early.	Yatangiye kare.
He said a lot.	Yavuze cyane.
At the time, it was difficult to capture.	Icyo gihe byari bigoye gufata.
Just a chance.	Amahirwe gusa.
They have a book.	Bafite igitabo.
There is always something good to watch.	Buri gihe hariho ikintu cyiza cyo kureba.
But it was not, it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo byari, ntabwo byari byiza.
You are so beautiful to me.	Uri mwiza cyane kuri njye.
But you have to win.	Ariko ugomba gutsinda.
I can be anyone.	Nshobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
He was going to be his father.	Yari agiye kuba se.
That's not a bad idea.	Icyo ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi.
In a short time he was an expert.	Mu gihe gito rwose yari umuhanga.
He looked at us.	Yarebye muri twe.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
That's right.	Nukuri.
'	'
But it would do nothing.	Ariko ntacyo byari gukora.
There is work to be done.	Hariho akazi ko gukora.
It is not easier than this.	Ntabwo byoroshye kurenza ibi.
Leave it as you wish.	Kureka uko ushaka.
I feel very happy about this.	Ndumva nishimiye cyane ibi.
You like to work.	Ukunda gukora.
Request advice.	Gusaba inama.
None of us had an idea.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari ufite igitekerezo.
And he was very worried.	Kandi yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
But no one had said why.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe yari yabwiye impamvu.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntushobora.
Only on the no.	Gusa no kuri no.
I'm on the phone with you.	Ndi kuri terefone nawe.
But maybe out here.	Ariko ahari hanze aha.
He watched a movie.	Yarebye firime.
In fact, it was too much.	Mubyukuri, byari byinshi cyane.
Not everyone has that.	Ntabwo abantu bose bafite ibyo bishoboka.
I feel like you can find anything here.	Ndumva ushobora kubona ikintu cyose hano.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo byari ukuri.
But he did not want to.	Ariko ntiyashakaga.
Normal.	Ibintu bisanzwe.
I am a very young man.	Ndi umusore muto cyane.
Today.	Muri iki gihe.
You do everything very well.	Ukora ibintu byose cyane.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
You do the same thing.	Ukora ikintu kimwe.
It wasn’t me, he meant, it wasn’t me.	Ntabwo ari njye, yashakaga kuvuga, ntabwo ari njye.
He is very sitting.	Yicaye cyane.
I can't eat much today.	Sinshobora kurya byinshi muri iki gihe.
It was hard to read.	Byari bigoye gusoma.
You don't have to go with it.	Ntugomba kujyana.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
Things went wrong for him.	Ibintu byagenze nabi kuri we.
I don't know enough.	Sinzi bihagije.
He said.	Yavuze.
He tried everything.	Yagerageje byose.
Take it all.	Gufata byose.
I think that's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
But he has to wait.	Ariko agomba gutegereza.
Come on.	Hasi.
It was a very popular movie.	Yari firime yakundaga cyane.
I need to do something else.	Nkeneye gukora ikindi kintu.
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza.
He knows where.	Azi aho.
That’s fine, as usual.	Nibyiza, nkuko bisanzwe.
He probably knew everything.	Birashoboka ko yari azi byose.
It was really easy.	Byari byoroshye rwose.
He needed to make sure he got the phone.	Yari akeneye kumenya neza ko yabonye terefone.
We can't see.	Ntidushobora kubona.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I always think.	Ntekereza buri gihe.
When you have problems.	Iyo ufite ibibazo.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
And he's not a bad person, really.	Kandi ntabwo ari umuntu mubi, mubyukuri.
Maybe it's just me.	Birashoboka ko ari njye gusa.
You want to learn, well.	Urashaka kwiga, neza.
It was a great thing to do.	Byari ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I'm going to do this.	Ngiye gukora ibi.
And you are beautiful.	Kandi uri mwiza.
Do you like it ?.	Ukunda?.
He had no reason to do so.	Nta mpamvu yari afite yo kubikora.
How to live alone.	Uburyo bwo kubaho wenyine.
This one was really nice.	Uyu rwose yari mwiza.
But I want to make this plan.	Ariko ndashaka gukora iyi gahunda.
There is a boy.	Hariho umuhungu.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
He just does the right thing.	Gusa akora ibintu byiza hafi ya byose.
This was not good.	Ibi ntabwo byari byiza.
Not a bad day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi mubi.
Sometimes, it's too much.	Rimwe na rimwe, ni byinshi cyane.
We were very close now.	Ubu twari hafi cyane.
But you are far away.	Ariko uri kure cyane.
I heard no one.	Nta muntu numvise.
After all, in fact.	Kuri byose, mubyukuri.
Not that he said much.	Ntabwo ari uko yavuze byinshi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I don't know how to speak ill of people.	Sinzi kuvuga nabi abantu.
I wanted to go home.	Nashakaga gutaha.
He started working hard.	Yatangiye gukora cyane.
That is not possible.	Ntabwo aribyo bishoboka.
Just tell me where.	Bwira gusa aho.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
That was really my mistake.	Ibyo byari amakosa yanjye rwose.
She was very nice and nice.	Yari mwiza cyane kandi mwiza.
He was no longer a child.	Ntiyari akiri umwana.
She was a very active woman.	Yari umugore ukora cyane.
I can never do that.	Sinshobora na rimwe kubikora.
Walking here was great.	Kugenda hano byari byiza.
I know it's you.	Nzi ko ari wowe.
I didn't think so.	Ntacyo natekerezaga.
I like to do it.	Nkunda kubikora.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That was good enough.	Ibyo byari byiza bihagije.
There is something wonderful about it.	Hariho ikintu cyiza cyane.
He never looked like her.	Ntiyigeze asa na we.
This is not really hard to do.	Ibi ntabwo mubyukuri bigoye gukora.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
We are not at home.	Ntabwo turi murugo.
He can't be alone.	Ntashobora kuba wenyine.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
It is not available now.	Ubu ntabwo ahari.
I would do the same thing.	Nari gukora ikintu kimwe.
And that's great.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza cyane.
I am not very young.	Ntabwo ndi muto cyane.
However, one can go far.	Ariko, umuntu arashobora kujya kure.
You want to be alone.	Urashaka wenyine.
In any case, the idea is the same.	Ibyo ari byo byose, igitekerezo ni kimwe.
It looks so good !.	Birasa neza cyane!.
He had a short time.	Yari afite igihe gito.
That was a good question, really.	Byari ikibazo cyiza, mubyukuri.
He was not alone.	Ntiyari wenyine.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
I'm the only one who feels bad.	Ninjye wenyine numva nabi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko hari byinshi kuri byo.
He did simple things.	Yakoze ibintu byoroshye.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo sibyo.
He never liked it very much.	Ntiyigeze akunda cyane.
It is not always in the forefront.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari imbere.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I don't have to talk to you.	Ntabwo ngomba kuvugana nawe.
A guy can.	Umusore arashobora.
He wanted everything he could get.	Yashakaga ibyo yashoboraga kubona byose.
I want to be away from here.	Ndashaka kuba kure hano.
There is plenty to eat.	Hariho byinshi byo kurya.
That would be great.	Ibi byaba aribyo byiza rwose.
I think there is a lot.	Ntekereza ko hari byinshi.
I know the same thing.	Nzi ikintu kimwe.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
He knew everything.	Ibyo yari azi byose.
To prison.	Kuri gereza.
That's right.	Nibyiza nibyo.
I'm not sure it will happen.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko bizaba.
I have never seen a boy like him.	Sinigeze mbona umuhungu nka we.
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
And this is something.	Kandi iki ni ikintu.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
I'm worried.	Mfite impungenge.
I think that's possible.	Ndatekereza ko bishoboka.
He has nothing to do.	Nta kintu na kimwe afite cyo gukora.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He didn't want to be here.	Ntiyashakaga kuba hano.
But there is no going.	Ariko nta kugenda.
I don't know fear.	Ntazi ubwoba.
I should be at home.	Nkwiye kuba murugo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kuri ibyo.
I don't have to stay here.	Ntabwo ngomba kuguma hano.
Tell a woman.	Bwira umugore.
I don't know if it's possible.	Sinzi niba bishoboka.
A woman, not a girl.	Umugore, ntabwo ari umukobwa.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
Down here, no tomorrow.	Hasi aha, nta ejo.
He did something.	Yakoze ikintu.
To do so is another.	Kubikora ni ikindi.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
They know exactly what it is.	Bazi neza icyo aricyo.
He had a long time.	Yari afite igihe kirekire.
And this looks great.	Kandi ibi birasa neza.
There is truth in all this.	Hariho ukuri kuri ibyo byose.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
You're just going to say.	Ugiye kuvuga gusa.
It's too big for me.	Ni kinini kuri njye.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo sibyo.
One day, he would be ready.	Umunsi umwe, yaba yiteguye.
We need more of it.	Dukeneye byinshi muri byo.
And the same.	Kandi kimwe.
Her son was out.	Umuhungu we yari hanze.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kubikora.
I want you to be alone.	Ndashaka ko uri wenyine.
They would do nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe bari gukora.
Not tonight, maybe.	Ntabwo ari iri joro, birashoboka.
At the time, he could not walk alone.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yashoboraga kugenda wenyine.
I don’t really do it especially.	Ntabwo rwose nkora cyane cyane.
Reading was not good.	Gusoma ntabwo byari byiza.
Talk to him.	Kuvugana na we.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
I can do anything without a problem.	Nshobora gukora ikintu cyose nta kibazo.
They had none.	Ntabwo bari bafite.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He was a good, good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza, mwiza.
Everyone had to go.	Umuntu wese yagombaga kugenda.
Maybe he should have known better.	Birashoboka ko yari akwiye kumenya neza.
Or he thought he did.	Cyangwa yatekereje ko yabikoze.
But he will do it one day !.	Ariko azabikora umunsi umwe!.
He was not young.	Ntiyari akiri muto.
He did it himself.	Yakoze na we wenyine.
It looks so good, after all.	Birasa nibyiza cyane, nyuma ya byose.
But apparently he did.	Ariko biragaragara ko yabikoze.
It was great to be with her again.	Byari byiza cyane kongera kubana na we.
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
I thought quickly.	Natekereje vuba.
It's for everyone.	Ni kuri bose.
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
Everything is the same for us.	Byose ni umwe kuri twe.
I can't see anything wrong.	Sinshobora kubona ikintu kibi.
You can't stay.	Ntushobora kuguma.
It was a lot of trouble.	Byari ibibazo byinshi.
He did a lot.	Yakoze byinshi.
It's not the same, but it looks like.	Ntabwo ari kimwe, ariko birasa.
I have nothing to do with it.	Ntacyo mfite cyo kubikora.
It's a problem sometimes, drinking alone.	Ni ikibazo rimwe na rimwe, kunywa wenyine.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
If we have everything we need.	Niba dufite ibyo dukeneye byose.
He just wanted to.	Yashakaga gusa.
Both were.	Bombi bari.
Maybe he saw something.	Birashoboka ko hari ikintu yabonye.
You do the same thing.	Ukora ikintu kimwe.
Someone was on us.	Umuntu yari kuri twe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But he went.	Ariko yagiye.
There is something here for everyone.	Hano hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
I can't.	Sinshobora.
You can do anything.	Urashobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
The best time is right for everyone.	Igihe cyiza nukuri kuri buri wese.
She felt embarrassed.	Yumvise afite isoni.
There is only life.	Hariho kubaho gusa.
He was dressed.	Yari yambaye.
Just let time.	Reka gusa igihe.
If you want to know.	Niba ushaka kumenya.
That's what you saw.	Ibyo wabonye nibyo.
But this is good.	Ariko ibi nibyiza.
They know better.	Bazi neza.
She is not a good girl.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa mwiza.
It was hard to believe he could survive.	Byari bigoye kwizera ko ashobora kubaho.
I didn't know what it was.	Sinari nzi icyo aricyo.
He had a lot of mistakes.	Yari afite amakosa menshi.
It's money.	Ni amafaranga.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
This is my daughter.	Uyu ni umukobwa wanjye.
I'm out here.	Ndi hanze aha.
And maybe we had.	Kandi birashoboka ko twari dufite.
But he did not.	Ariko ntabwo yabikoze.
If you are beautiful, you are beautiful.	Niba uri mwiza, uri mwiza.
I needed time to think.	Nari nkeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
There is something about going backwards.	Hariho ikintu cyo gusubira inyuma.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
Where this is not much to think about.	Aho ibi atari byinshi byo gutekereza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He could play at any time.	Yashoboraga gukina igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
This is me and him.	Ubu ni njye na we.
He is not very young.	Ntabwo ari muto cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Same time with us.	Igihe kimwe natwe.
You don't have to know what it is.	Ntugomba kumenya icyo aricyo.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
But there is something else you can do.	Ariko birashoboka ko hari ikindi ukora.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu.
I should have known then.	Nari nkwiye kumenya icyo gihe.
I guess that's the thing.	Ndakeka ko aricyo kintu.
But there is truth to it.	Ariko hariho ukuri kuri.
I meant a child.	Nashakaga kuvuga umwana.
But he did nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yakoze.
I haven't seen it since.	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze mbona.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
He was my young man.	Yari umusore wanjye.
He was never smart.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ubwenge.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo byari ukuri.
Any idea.	Igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose.
We can't go wrong here.	Ntidushobora kugenda nabi hano.
But we were friends.	Ariko twari inshuti.
He could have said something very bad.	Yashoboraga kuvuga ikintu kibi cyane.
But this is really the case.	Ariko ibi rwose ni imbere.
I think your time is up.	Ndatekereza ko umwanya wawe uri.
He didn't deserve it.	Ntabwo yari akwiye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
All for the better.	Byose ku byiza.
Very close, close.	Hafi cyane, hafi.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
There is a dog.	Hariho imbwa.
He was not a child at all.	Ntiyari umwana rwose.
Anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Only one in fact.	Umwe gusa mubyukuri.
He had a reason to be there.	Yari afite impamvu yo kuba ahari.
I thought to myself.	Natekerezaga wenyine.
He feels alone.	Yumva ari wenyine.
I want to say goodbye.	Ndashaka kuvuga neza.
He can't even do it.	Ntashobora no kubikora.
He looked at her hopefully.	Yarebye yizeye.
It was true, and easy to say.	Byari ukuri, kandi byoroshye kuvuga.
We are here.	Turi hano.
But that may not be the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari ikibazo.
But he was not bad.	Ariko ntabwo yari mubi.
It's good to read.	Nibyiza gusoma.
I know you want kids.	Nzi ko ushaka abana.
We have it all !.	Dufite byose!.
Or apply for a job.	Cyangwa gusaba akazi.
Doing well.	Gukora neza.
You are not wrong.	Ntabwo ufite amakosa.
She was close to her hair.	Yari hafi umusatsi.
I hope he is not at work tonight.	Nizere ko atari ku kazi muri iri joro.
More than anyone else in the world.	Kurenza umuntu uwo ari we wese kuri iyi si.
I want to add to this.	Ndashaka kongera kuri ibi.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
I saw.	Nabonye.
Everything to live for, and what you have.	Ikintu cyose cyo kubaho, kandi ufite iki.
But he had to try.	Ariko yagombaga kugerageza.
You do it all by yourself.	Ukora byose wenyine.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He knew what to do next.	Yari azi icyo yagombaga gukora nyuma.
He did not ask for anything.	Nta na kimwe yasabye.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
I didn't know what it was.	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo ibyo aribyo.
He saw a little girl.	Yabonye umukobwa muto.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
Stop hearing things.	Reka kureka kumva ibintu.
It's better to be outside.	Nibyiza ko hanze.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
The child had to live.	Umwana yagombaga kubaho.
That's right.	Byari byo.
I don't want to live.	Ntashaka kubaho.
He said he wanted to relinquish his position.	Yavuze ko yashakaga kureka umwanya we.
But nothing else.	Ariko si ikindi kintu.
But that would do nothing.	Ariko ibyo ntacyo byari gukora.
We had a lot of people.	Twari dufite abantu benshi.
He had to know what had happened.	Yagombaga kumenya uko byagenze.
He knew what he was going to get.	Yari azi icyo yari kubona.
I want your son.	Ndashaka umuhungu wawe.
Sometimes for a long time.	Rimwe na rimwe igihe kirekire.
Many are scared.	Benshi bafite ubwoba.
Well you know nothing about me.	Byiza ntacyo uzi kuri njye.
They are not human beings.	Ntabwo ari abantu.
All the food was food.	Ibiryo byose byari ibiryo.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
One person.	Umuntu umwe.
I wanted to be with him.	Nashakaga kubana na we.
So much for me.	Byinshi kuri njye.
That's all you need.	Ibyo byose ukeneye.
We have no buses here.	Nta bisi dufite hano.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari afite.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
They have that.	Bafite ibyo.
But in reality, one could do what one wants.	Ariko mubyukuri, umuntu yashoboraga gukora ibyo ashaka.
I think we have to wait until tomorrow.	Ndakeka ko tugomba gutegereza kugeza ejo.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
Anyone can eat this.	Umuntu wese arashobora kurya ibi.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
I had a daughter.	Nari mfite umukobwa.
You didn't see it.	Ntabwo wabonye.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
But it was good enough.	Ariko byari byiza bihagije.
You can be good.	Urashobora kuba mwiza.
I don't feel right.	Ntabwo numva ari ukuri.
He must know for sure.	Agomba kumenya neza.
I should have done it sooner.	Nari nkwiye kubikora vuba.
He was alone and no one knew where he was.	Yari wenyine kandi nta muntu wari uzi aho ari.
No one at all.	Nta muntu n'umwe rwose.
He thought he should be.	Yatekereje ko agomba kuba.
He was still there.	Yari akiri aho.
I don’t think it would be very good.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko byaba byiza cyane.
Not bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
I hope he can come soon.	Ndizera ko ashobora kuza vuba.
You don't even have to be here.	Ntugomba no kuba hano.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
This is no help.	Ubu ntabwo ari ubufasha.
It’s not just an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
But he is not alone.	Ariko si we wenyine.
We are not a problem.	Ntabwo turi ikibazo.
That will be tomorrow.	Ibyo bizaba ejo.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hafi ya bose.
He is alone.	Ari wenyine.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
It is before marriage.	Ni mbere yo gushaka.
He may know something.	Ashobora kumenya ikintu.
But that’s probably the good thing.	Ariko birashoboka ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko ibyo.
And all the people were many.	Kandi abantu bose bari benshi.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
Doing this.	Gukora ibi.
I hope that is not the case.	Nizere ko atari ko bigoye.
You have no way out.	Ntabwo ufite uburyo bwo kugenda.
It would be possible to see only the problems.	Byaba bishoboka kubona ibibazo gusa.
What did he think?	Yatekereje iki?
He was the one he used to be.	Yari uwo yahoze.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He had no plans.	Nta gahunda yari afite.
He is not right.	Ntabwo avuga neza.
I want to think that it is.	Ndashaka gutekereza ko aribyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
You were a family to him.	Wari umuryango kuri we.
He didn't really know it was good.	Mubyukuri ntabwo yari azi ko ari mwiza.
I think we can think a lot here.	Ndatekereza ko dushobora gutekereza cyane hano.
He hears people.	Yumva abantu.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
It was very bad.	Yari mubi cyane.
You would be a sitting dog.	Waba imbwa yicaye.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
I just thought how good it would be.	Gusa natekereje uburyo byaba byiza.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
Inside, behind.	Imbere, inyuma.
I mean, for me.	Ndashaka kuvuga, kuri njye.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Do it now.	Kubikora kuri ubu.
I never liked this.	Sinigeze nkunda ibi.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
That's all.	Nibyo gusa.
For many.	Kuri benshi.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
In my house.	Mu nzu yanjye.
There is one last thing.	Hariho ikintu cya nyuma.
.	.
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bose ari inshuti nziza gusa.
He never loved that one.	Ntiyigeze akunda uwo.
I mean, we can't go now.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntidushobora kugenda ubu.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ibyo byari amakosa yanjye.
It was easy for me.	Byari byoroshye kuri njye.
He had no reason to be.	Nta mpamvu yari afite yo kuba.
Let go !.	Kureka!.
Down here.	Hano hasi.
He is not his son.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu we.
I feel good.	Ndumva uri mwiza.
I think it's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
He didn't feel young.	Ntiyari yumva akiri muto.
Here is his friend.	Hano hari inshuti ye.
Good plan.	Gahunda nziza.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
For me.	Kuri njye.
Good, but good.	Nibyiza, ariko byiza.
He is the only one.	Ari wenyine wenyine.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Return early.	Gutaha kare.
It was his fault.	Byari amakosa ye.
She wants a baby, her baby.	Ashaka umwana, umwana we.
I have to be scared.	Ngomba kugira ubwoba.
That's when he would eat.	Icyo gihe ni bwo yari kurya.
This is all we have.	Ibi nibyo dufite byose.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
Playing together.	Gukina hamwe.
Maybe sometimes.	Ahari rimwe na rimwe.
I like to drive.	Nkunda gutwara.
He doesn't really mean it.	Ntabwo ashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
I heard him speak.	Numvise avuga.
I doubt that is the case.	Ndashidikanya ko aribyo.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
It's in you.	Ni muri wowe.
It was early.	Yari kare kare.
I'm going to.	Ngiye ku.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
And that was enough.	Kandi byari bihagije.
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
Great idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
They have children.	Bafite abana.
Or very much.	Cyangwa cyane.
No one could see it.	Nta muntu n'umwe yashoboraga kubona.
She was very nice and nice.	Yari mwiza cyane kandi neza.
He was not far away.	Ntabwo yari kure cyane.
The truth is.	Ukuri ni.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
Your hair.	Umusatsi wawe.
They are just wrong.	Bafite amakosa gusa.
I am looking for my son.	Ndashaka umuhungu wanjye.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
He knew he looked good.	Yari azi ko asa neza.
He would not come.	Ntabwo yari kuza.
Now he wants to talk.	Ubu arashaka kuvuga.
Not good, but close.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko hafi.
And that's right.	Kandi ibyo ni byo.
I thought this was a good thing.	Natekereje ko iki ari ikintu cyiza.
It is not a thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Know the plan.	Kumenya gahunda.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He works alone.	Akora wenyine.
If he had taken the bus.	Niba yari yafashe bisi.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
He began to retreat.	Yatangiye gusubira inyuma.
And that's right.	Kandi ibyo nibyo.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
But this is exactly what you want.	Ariko ibi nibyo rwose ushaka.
It is not good and it is not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
It's early in the morning.	Hari mu gitondo cya kare.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
But that’s not what we had.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo twari dufite.
He had the opportunity to know at all.	Yagize amahirwe yo kumenya na gato.
It was time to look bad.	Byari mugihe cyo kubona nabi.
It is not true.	Ntabwo ari kuri.
I'm not happy.	Ntabwo nishimiye.
And he was a player.	Kandi yari umukinnyi.
We can't do this.	Ntidushobora gukora ibi.
And sometimes he knew he was going to do it.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe yari azi ko azabikora.
He did a lot.	Yakoze byinshi.
I knew his wife.	Nari nzi umugore we.
You can say anything.	Urashobora kuvuga ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
Very low.	Hasi cyane.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
But he was not alone.	Ariko ntiyari wenyine.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I am grateful for the help.	Nishimiye ubufasha.
He wanted this very much.	Yashakaga ibi cyane.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
He could say nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kuvuga.
Here it is !.	Hano ni!.
He was not sure what to do at the time.	Ntiyari azi neza icyo yari gukora icyo gihe.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
You saw what he was doing.	Wabonye icyo akora.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
You can see anything.	Urashobora kubona ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
For me.	Kuri njye.
I knew it, and I saw nothing wrong with it.	Nari nzi, kandi nta kibi nabonye.
It seems.	Birasa.
I saw it here.	Nabonye hano.
Trying to articulate a problem.	Kugerageza kuvuga ikibazo.
Everyone who has a job has to work.	Umuntu wese afite akazi agomba gukora.
I think almost always.	Ntekereza hafi buri gihe.
We don't have time to do that.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya wo kubikora.
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
It’s great, and just money.	Nibyiza cyane, kandi amafaranga gusa.
I thought a lot about this.	Natekereje cyane kuri ibi.
Or you can't.	Cyangwa ntushobora.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
But not recently.	Ariko ntabwo ari vuba aha.
They were inside and out.	Bari imbere kandi imbere.
He was a good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza.
I need to know why you are here.	Nkeneye kumenya impamvu uri hano.
It’s not hard to know that thing.	Ntabwo bigoye kumenya icyo kintu.
I need to think, to think.	Nkeneye gutekereza, gutekereza.
You can see if there is.	Urashobora kubona niba ahari.
I didn't know that.	Ntabwo nari nzi icyo kibazo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari kugenda.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
And we are friends.	Kandi turi inshuti.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
We are not many people.	Ntabwo turi abantu benshi.
Only one of us is coming.	Umwe gusa muri twe ugiye kuza.
It was a wonderful experience.	Nibyiza byari ibintu byiza rwose.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
He is not a good person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu kuba mwiza.
I thought.	Natekereje.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
And he knew it was true.	Kandi yari azi ko ari ukuri.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
It is impossible to do.	Ntabwo bishoboka gukora.
I want to be a good guy	Ndashaka kuba umusore mwiza.
I doubt if anyone is inside.	Ndashidikanya niba hari umuntu imbere.
Making clothes.	Gukora imyenda.
His family was embarrassed.	Umuryango we wari ufite isoni.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko gukina.
Study the problem.	Kwiga ikibazo.
Today her hair was so beautiful.	Uyu munsi umusatsi we wari mwiza cyane.
Same thing with him, really.	Ikintu kimwe na we, mubyukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It is very likely that his wife.	Birashoboka cyane ko umugore we.
He does nothing.	Ntacyo akora.
I have them all.	Mfite bose.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
But it was outside.	Ariko byari hanze.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
He seemed to think.	Yasaga naho yatekereje.
Probably not much to say.	Birashoboka ko nta byinshi byo kuvuga.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Apparently it was a mistake.	Biragaragara ko ari amakosa.
He is not my player.	Ntabwo ari umukinnyi wanjye.
He was a good player.	Yari umukinnyi mwiza.
Right now, it’s a real job.	Kuri ubu, ni akazi rwose.
Everything he said.	Ibyo yavuze byose.
This is true and not true.	Ibi ni ukuri ntabwo ari ukuri.
I hope they are right.	Nizera ko bafite ukuri.
Maybe stop.	Ahari guhagarika.
He is going to speak.	Agiye kuvuga.
Maybe even a good movie.	Ahari na firime nziza.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
I heard enough.	Numvise bihagije.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
Or on one of them.	Cyangwa kuri kimwe muri byo.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
But you can also cancel the schedule at any time.	Ariko urashobora kandi guhagarika gahunda igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora kuri ibi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu tugomba kureba.
But you know so much.	Ariko uzi byinshi cyane.
You have learned to trust people.	Wabonye kwiga kwizera abantu.
If at all possible.	Niba bishoboka rwose.
It was very low.	Yari hasi cyane.
A lot of things are.	Ibintu byinshi ni.
Driving	Gutwara imodoka.
So far, good.	Kugeza ubu, byiza.
Please, please, please.	Nyamuneka, nyamuneka, nyamuneka.
Much more than any of us can know.	Byinshi kurenza buri wese muri twe ushobora kumenya.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
But he has nothing to do with that.	Ariko ntacyo akora kuri ibyo.
It could be you.	Urashobora kuba wowe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, birashoboka ko atari byinshi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
Up.	Hejuru.
We have to swim.	Tugomba koga.
I didn't know how to do it.	Ntabwo nari nzi kubikora.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He may not be able to help, but he can try.	Birashoboka ko adashobora gufasha, ariko arashobora kugerageza.
I've seen all this before.	Nabonye ibi byose mbere.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
He is sitting.	Yicaye.
I'm at work.	Ninjye uri ku kazi.
I didn't want to know.	Sinifuzaga kumenya.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ni igitekerezo cyiza.
But that was too much for him.	Ariko ibi byari byinshi cyane kuri we.
You can't even know people.	Ntushobora no kumenya abantu.
They were right.	Bari ukuri.
She loves children.	Akunda abana.
You are taking something.	Urimo gufata ikintu.
Just like learning to speak.	Kimwe no kwiga kuvuga.
I'm glad it's there.	Nishimiye ko ahari.
.	.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
He went to it.	Yagiye kuri yo.
There are many of them.	Hariho byinshi muri byo.
But you were one of them.	Ariko wari umwe kuri.
Mary was behind him.	Mariya yari inyuma ye.
I guess that's possible.	Ndakeka ko bishoboka.
That he never did, he would never do it.	Ko atigeze agira, nta na rimwe yari kubikora.
I have never seen so many people.	Sinigeze mbona abantu benshi.
You want to do it.	Urashaka kubikora.
I'm just scared, whatever.	Mfite ubwoba gusa, ibyo aribyo byose.
I feel ashamed.	Ndumva mfite isoni.
It looks bad.	Birasa nabi.
He really tried to help.	Yagerageje rwose gufasha.
But he has a lot of things.	Ariko afite ibintu byinshi.
He enjoyed that.	Yishimiye ibyo.
Let go, man.	Reka, muntu.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
The whole family did it.	Umuryango wose wabikoze.
Eating cookies.	Kurya kuki.
He was an expert.	Yari umuhanga.
It was so good, so good.	Byari byiza cyane, ikintu cyiza cyane.
He said he came.	Yavuze ko yaje.
I hope it's not tonight.	Ndizera ko atari iri joro.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
That's great right now.	Nibyiza cyane ubu.
I felt scared.	Numvise mfite ubwoba.
He has to, maybe.	Agomba kugira, birashoboka.
One was just young.	Umwe yari muto gusa.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
The food is good and everything you can eat.	Ibiryo nibyiza kandi byose ushobora kurya.
And if he doesn't.	Niba kandi atabikoze.
There is no going back on me now.	Nta gusubira inyuma kuri njye ubu.
You're the only one here.	Wowe wenyine cyane hano.
''	''.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
In many ways.	Muri byinshi.
To see	Kubona.
I feel it is a great time.	Ndumva ari umwanya mwiza cyane.
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
He had children.	Yari afite abana.
Or maybe he was away from me.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari kure yanjye.
Or no one.	Cyangwa nta muntu n'umwe.
His father meant.	Se yashakaga kuvuga.
This is very clear.	Ibi biragaragara rwose.
You need to know the plan.	Ugomba kumenya gahunda.
.	.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
He didn't know why, at the time.	Ntabwo yari azi impamvu, kuki icyo gihe.
That's right.	Nibyo.
The first time I heard it was scary.	Numvise bwa mbere byari ubwoba.
The phone was on the phone.	Terefone yari kuri terefone.
He had a place to go.	Yari afite aho agomba kujya.
I think about everything.	Ntekereza kuri byose.
No one said.	Nta muntu yabwiye.
I think you are beautiful.	Ndatekereza ko uri mwiza.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
And that's great.	Kandi ni byiza cyane.
You don't have to do that.	Ntugomba kubikora.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
It was better than the movie.	Byari byiza kuruta firime.
And it's good for him.	Kandi ni byiza kuri we.
But we had.	Ariko twari dufite.
And this is exactly what he wanted to do.	Kandi ibi nibyo yashakaga gukora.
You see what we can do.	Wabonye icyo dushobora gukora.
He doesn't know much about anything.	Nta kintu kinini azi ku kintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
Or a good movie.	Cyangwa firime nziza.
He went to his father.	Yagiye kwa se.
He was now very far away.	Ubu yari kure cyane.
Maybe we're all close to him.	Birashoboka ko twese turi hafi ye.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
And that's really cool.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza rwose.
Only.	Gusa.
No one said much.	Nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
He thought he was doing something good.	Yatekereje ko akora ikintu cyiza.
It is the best opportunity.	Ni amahirwe kuruta ikindi kintu cyose.
You want to stop this from happening.	Urashaka guhagarika ibi kubaho.
And he was not alone.	Kandi ntiyari wenyine.
I'm not.	Ntabwo ndimo.
I know a lot about him.	Nzi byinshi kuri we.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
That's not what he expected.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yiteze.
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
He was not going to win.	Ntabwo yari agiye gutsinda.
She may have children.	Birashoboka ko afite abana.
Maybe years were something.	Ahari imyaka yari ikintu.
We can't win.	Ntidushobora gutsinda.
It’s not much, but it’s something.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, ariko ni ikintu.
I want to see more.	Ndashaka kubona byinshi.
There is nothing to do.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gukora.
Bad idea, bad.	Igitekerezo kibi, kibi.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
I should be nice.	Nkwiye kuba mwiza.
It's not my fault at all.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yanjye rwose.
You can't find much.	Ntushobora kubona byinshi.
I didn't know what to do here.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora hano.
And, of course, everything is fine.	Kandi, rwose, ibintu byose ni byiza.
However, there is more.	Ariko, hariho byinshi.
He has mistakes.	Afite amakosa.
We all need help.	Twese dukeneye ubufasha.
I think that is possible.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Everyone had to be around all the time.	Umuntu wese yagombaga kuba hafi igihe cyose.
It was a mistake anyone could make.	Byari amakosa umuntu wese yashoboraga gukora.
I am far away.	Ndi kure yanjye.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo ariko ntabwo mugihe gito.
He got it right.	Yabonye neza.
I heard no one.	Nta muntu numvise.
That too was my fault.	Ibyo na byo byari amakosa yanjye.
She is very good at it.	Ari mwiza cyane muri byo.
It's normal.	Ni ibintu bisanzwe.
This is really good.	Ibi ni byiza rwose.
They didn't have one before.	Ntabwo bari bafite mbere.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo byose.
He was not lucky.	Ntabwo yari afite amahirwe.
And not to mention today.	Kandi nta kuvuga iki gihe.
Maybe a book.	Ahari igitabo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I think that's what he meant.	Ntekereza ko aricyo ashaka kuvuga.
He should have known better than that.	Yagombaga kumenya neza kuruta ibyo.
He thinks you are beautiful.	Yibwira ko uri mwiza.
But that's almost all.	Ariko ibyo hafi ya byose.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
All of this was great.	Ibi byose byari byiza.
He doesn't seem to want to talk at all.	Asa naho adashaka kuvuga na gato.
And you have to.	Kandi ugomba nawe.
It was something he did when he was scared.	Ni ikintu yakoze igihe yari afite ubwoba.
This is a real thing.	Iki ni ikintu rwose.
And that's really cool.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza rwose.
But we are ashamed.	Ariko dufite isoni.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I didn't want to be here.	Sinifuzaga kuba hano.
That's not good.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
He should have studied by now.	Yari akwiye kwiga kugeza ubu.
They knew the plan.	Bari bazi gahunda.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I never saw a reason to leave.	Sinigeze mbona impamvu yo kugenda.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He was one of many.	Yari umwe muri benshi.
Just me	Ndi njye gusa.
But if it is possible, we have to think about it.	Ariko niba bishoboka, tugomba gutekereza ko yabikoze.
But what we need is too much.	Ariko icyo dukeneye ni kinini cyane.
In fact, it is better.	Mubyukuri, ni byiza.
The woman was young.	Umugore yari muto.
But that was not enough.	Ariko ntabwo byari bihagije.
I would buy anything.	Nari kugura ikintu cyose.
I don't know for years.	Sinzi neza imyaka.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ntiyashakaga kuvugana nanjye.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo yari menshi.
I hope you know what it is.	Nizere ko uzi icyo aricyo.
My son was a young child at the time.	Icyo gihe umuhungu wanjye yari umwana muto.
No one is closer to me than my family.	Nta muntu uri hafi yanjye kuruta umuryango wanjye.
She has a child.	Afite umwana.
Then it will be better.	Icyo gihe bizaba byiza.
It was good before.	Byari byiza mbere.
My wife can talk to you.	Umugore wanjye arashobora kuvugana nawe.
This is it.	Ndi uyu.
It really wasn’t a time to think.	Ntabwo rwose byari umwanya wo gutekereza.
No one got a job.	Nta n'umwe wabonye akazi.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
I was a child.	Nari umwana.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
I want to work.	Ndashaka gukora.
He does a lot.	Akora byinshi.
I have not always heard.	Ntabwo buri gihe numvise.
For me, that’s not the big deal.	Kuri njye, ntabwo aricyo kintu kinini.
Doing this would have been difficult.	Gukora ibi byari kuba bigoye.
I wanted to play more.	Nashakaga gukina byinshi.
But he just said something normal.	Ariko yavuze ibintu bisanzwe gusa.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
I saw a lot about him.	Nabonye byinshi kuri we.
People are here.	Abantu bari hano.
It's just backwards, that's all.	Ari inyuma gusa, nibyo byose.
He spoke in support of the US Alliance, but said that maintaining some independence was important.	Yavuze kuri buri kibazo ushobora gutekereza.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
He has a job.	Afite akazi.
And here he was.	Kandi hano yari hano.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
If you want to see.	Niba ushaka kubona.
He was only three years old.	Yari afite imyaka itatu gusa.
But everything they had.	Ariko ibyo bari bafite byose.
As if he had no problem.	Nkuko nta kibazo yari afite.
I can't talk on the phone.	Sinshobora kuvugana kuri terefone.
It was not true at all.	Ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
He can't leave enough alone.	Ntashobora kureka bihagije wenyine.
Play well.	Gukina neza.
We are here to watch.	Turi hano kureba.
He was my age.	Yari afite imyaka yanjye.
Like me	Nkanjye.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we yari afite ubwoba.
But it was good, and it was good.	Ariko byari byiza, kandi yari mwiza.
I don’t want to do too much.	Sinshaka gukora byinshi.
He had no idea.	Nta kintu na kimwe yatekereje.
Of course, he was scared.	Ni ukuri, yari afite ubwoba.
He is sitting.	Yicaye.
But we need something else.	Ariko dukeneye ikindi kintu.
Maybe a good friend.	Ahari inshuti nziza.
He saw nothing, in fact.	Ntacyo yabonye, ​​mubyukuri.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
Anyone could come home.	Umuntu wese yashoboraga gutaha.
But in reality, it is not.	Ariko mubyukuri, sibyo.
I work for a long time.	Nkora igihe kirekire.
Maybe we should.	Birashoboka ko tugomba.
He wanted to say something else.	Yashakaga kuvuga ikindi kintu.
They were together, they were together.	Bari hamwe, bari hamwe.
It was not far.	Ntiyari kure.
He just said.	Yavuze gusa.
Then he went to eat.	Nyuma yagiye kurya.
With the plan.	Hamwe na gahunda.
He wants to work hard.	Ashaka gukora cyane.
We have nothing here.	Hano nta na kimwe dufite.
It was about to be in his house.	Byari hafi kuba mu nzu ye.
And no.	Kandi ntabwo.
He tried to leave.	Yagerageje kugenda.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
I'm going to quit now.	Ubu ngiye kureka.
I have to be doing something good.	Ngomba kuba nkora ikintu cyiza.
The problem, however, is not.	Ikibazo ariko sibyo.
Especially, very soon.	Cyane, vuba cyane.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
But his father was right.	Ariko se yari afite ukuri.
It’s not just food.	Ntabwo ari ibiryo gusa.
Eating cookies.	Kurya kuki.
She was good at it when she needed it.	Yari mwiza kuri ibyo mugihe yari akeneye.
It’s not really that hard.	Ntabwo rwose bigoye cyane.
He loved to get along well.	Yakundaga kubana neza.
This is a difficult situation.	Ibi ni ibintu bigoye.
And it's not always easy.	Kandi ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye.
I got my money.	Nabonye amafaranga yanjye.
I should know better.	Nkwiye kumenya neza.
He is obviously right.	Biragaragara ko afite ukuri.
He needs to be on top of me all the time.	Akeneye kuba hejuru yanjye buri gihe.
And that is a chance.	Kandi ibyo ni amahirwe.
Or what he thought.	Cyangwa icyo yari yatekereje.
But that is only temporary.	Ariko ibyo ni igihe gito.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
I just didn't think it would happen soon.	Gusa sinatekerezaga ko bizaba vuba aha.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
So much, so good.	Byinshi, byiza cyane.
He wants one.	Ashaka umwe.
I didn't want to do anything.	Sinifuzaga gukora ikintu na kimwe.
Why is that ???.	Kuki aribyo ???.
I am everything.	Ndi byose.
This is a great movie.	Iyi ni firime nziza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He agreed to do so.	Yemeye kubikora.
I felt good about him.	Numvise neza kuri we.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
The reason was this.	Impamvu yari iyi.
But not tonight.	Ariko si iri joro.
I'm sure I'm sorry.	Nzi neza ko mbabajwe.
That's right!	Ni ukuri!.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
At the time, he was alone.	Icyo gihe, yari wenyine.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I don't like it at all.	Ntabwo nkunda na gato.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Looking up was a mistake.	Kureba hejuru byari amakosa.
And he was not alone.	Kandi ntiyari wenyine.
The guy is walking.	Umusore arimo kugenda.
I know this is not good for me.	Nzi ko ibi atari byiza kuri njye.
Really wait a long time.	Nukuri gutegereza igihe kirekire.
But it is bad and bad.	Ariko ni mubi kandi mubi.
And living with you.	Kandi kubana nawe.
But one had to.	Ariko umuntu yagombaga.
But no one.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe.
Apparently that is his problem.	Biragaragara ko aricyo kibazo cye.
I knew everyone in school.	Nari nzi abantu bose bari mwishuri.
You’re thinking a lot.	Urimo gutekereza cyane.
It was easy to think.	Gutekereza byari byoroshye.
I have no problem doing that.	Nta kibazo mfite cyo kubikora.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
And for everyone.	Kandi kuri buri wese.
Then we need help.	Icyo gihe dukeneye ubufasha.
He is one of us now.	Ni umwe muri twe ubu.
You can't go now.	Ntushobora kugenda ubu.
All of this would go wrong.	Ibi byose byari kugenda nabi.
I am the only one.	Uwo ni njye wenyine.
But especially his children.	Ariko cyane cyane abana be.
He is my person.	Ni umuntu wanjye.
She is worried.	Afite impungenge.
He could have anyone.	Yashoboraga kugira umuntu uwo ari we wese.
You are about to leave.	Ugiye kugenda.
It's easy.	Byoroshye.
Very good, very good.	Nibyiza cyane, byiza cyane.
He did it alone.	Yakoze wenyine.
But you don't have to worry about that.	Ariko ntugomba kugira ikibazo kuri ibyo.
Not many of us.	Nta benshi muri twe.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
He was a young and beautiful child.	Yari umwana muto kandi mwiza.
That was the problem.	Ibyo byari ikibazo.
You know what to do.	Uzi icyo ugomba gukora.
If not, tell me.	Niba atari byo, mbwira.
There is no stopping.	Nta guhagarika.
That's right, and that's right.	Nibyo, kandi nibyo.
You don't have to do anything.	Ntugomba gukora ikintu.
Working with, and especially with, watching.	Gukora na, cyane cyane, kureba.
He was a householder.	Yari umuntu wo mu nzu.
Much, much easier.	Byinshi, byoroshye cyane.
He thought easily.	Yatekereje byoroshye.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
He was still upstairs.	Yari akiri hejuru.
If you know someone, you can take them.	Niba uzi umuntu, urashobora gufata.
She needs to drink.	Akeneye kunywa.
I really can't say.	Ntabwo rwose nshobora kuvuga.
He could have been far away.	Yashoboraga kure.
We must learn by faith, first of all.	Tugomba kwiga kwizera, mbere ya byose.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
I know it's a lot.	Nzi ko ari byinshi.
It was easy for me to take this.	Byari byoroshye kuri njye gufata iyi.
This time, nothing.	Iki gihe, ntacyo.
No need to be nice.	Nta mpamvu yo kuba mwiza.
I was before.	Nari mbere.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
I didn't want anything.	Ntacyo nashakaga.
We can't get a job.	Ntidushobora kubona akazi.
We have, we have.	Dufite, dufite.
Whatever you do.	Icyo ugomba gukora cyose.
The guy.	Umusore.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
All is possible.	Bose birashoboka.
I think it would.	Ndatekereza ko byaba.
He doesn't need to.	Ntabwo akeneye.
I can go back.	Nshobora gusubira inyuma.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
You’re scared, and that’s exactly it.	Ufite ubwoba, kandi nibyo rwose.
But a woman.	Ariko umugore.
Maybe he didn’t have time.	Birashoboka ko atari afite umwanya.
Women, women.	Akazi, akazi.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Yashoboraga gukora icyo ashaka cyose.
It is not always good for everyone.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari byiza kuri buri wese.
I really wanted to win.	Nashakaga rwose gutsinda.
I know it was good.	Nzi ko byari byiza.
You can't say why.	Ntushobora kuvuga impamvu.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Ntiyari azi icyo yatekerezaga.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
I didn't know that.	Sinari nzi icyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari kubikora.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
You know what he meant by that.	Uzi ko yashakaga kuvuga ibyo yavuze.
That's really good.	Nibyiza mubyukuri.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
Getting a job.	Kubona akazi.
It seems easy at the time.	Birasa nkaho byoroshye icyo gihe.
Baby.	Umwana.
They both had money.	Bombi bari bafite amafaranga.
Maybe buy something.	Ahari kugura ikintu.
And for me.	Kandi kuri njye.
We can never tell the truth or the truth.	Ntidushobora na rimwe kuvuga mubyukuri cyangwa ukuri.
His father may have.	Se ashobora kuba afite.
You are my daughter, now.	Uri umukobwa wanjye, ubu.
I am not young.	Ntabwo ndi muto.
He did what he came to do.	Yakoze ibyo yaje gukora.
And sometimes that's exactly what we can do.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe ibyo rwose nibyo dushobora gukora.
I have to try to find something small.	Ngomba kugerageza kubona ikintu gito.
But, that's not what you think.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo utekereza.
It was a book.	Byari igitabo.
She did not want to live together.	Ntabwo yashakaga kubana.
He may be scared.	Ashobora kuba afite ubwoba.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Umuntu wese yashakaga kubana na we.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I need someone here.	Nkeneye umuntu hano.
He never heard of anything.	Ntiyigeze yumva ikintu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He was very skilled.	Yari umuhanga cyane.
But you can’t always win.	Ariko ntushobora gutsinda buri gihe.
Me too.	Nanjye.
At that time there was.	Icyo gihe hari.
He was well aware that they were close.	Yari azi neza ko bari hafi.
Or you need help.	Cyangwa ukeneye ubufasha.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
I want to do it tomorrow.	Ndashaka kubikora ejo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
After all, he would still be here.	Nyuma ya byose, yaba akiri hano.
It was not an easy task.	Ntabwo byari ibintu byoroshye.
John, who I was.	John, uwo yari njye.
They were not here.	Ntabwo bari hano.
This is what we need.	Ibi nibyo dukeneye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
He was not young.	Ntabwo yari akiri muto.
Or he thought.	Cyangwa yatekereje.
That was a good thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza.
I am very low.	Ndi hasi cyane.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
I enjoyed reading.	Nishimiye gusoma.
I'm sure he's right.	Nzi neza ko afite ukuri.
I don't like to think.	Ntabwo nkunda gutekereza.
This is a very good book.	Iki ni igitabo cyiza cyane.
They had a lot.	Bari bafite byinshi.
Here's a tip.	Hano hari inama.
No need to work.	Nta mpamvu yo gukora.
Anyone, is the same.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese, ni kimwe.
But there is a reason.	Ariko hariho impamvu.
He wanted his father.	Yashakaga se.
Everything went wrong.	Ibintu byose byagenze nabi.
If not, you can do something else.	Niba atari byo, ushobora gukora ikindi kintu.
It's not too far out here, really.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane hano, mubyukuri.
That, or quit now.	Ibyo, cyangwa kureka ubu.
They wouldn't tell me.	Ntabwo bari kumbwira.
You have to get out of here.	Ugomba kuva hano.
Tom can't wait.	Tom ntashobora gutegereza.
He could see nothing inside.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona imbere.
It was great !.	Byari byiza!.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari amafaranga.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
No one saw it.	Nta muntu n'umwe yabonye.
He knew who he was.	Yari azi uwo ari we.
No one knows how to do it.	Nta muntu n'umwe uzi kubikora.
And whatever.	Kandi icyo aricyo cyose.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
Playing was another issue.	Gukina byari ikindi kibazo.
The viewing time is limited.	Umwanya wo kureba ni muto.
He knew he needed help.	Yari azi ko akeneye ubufasha.
In him alone, it was all.	Muri we gusa, byari byose.
We were.	Twari.
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.
But it's good to see.	Ariko ni byiza kureba.
Maybe a little time.	Ahari umwanya muto.
In fact, this is especially true.	Mubyukuri, ibi cyane cyane.
He did not know why.	Ntiyari azi impamvu.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
We are in fact.	Turi mubyukuri.
I don't know what he looks like.	Ntabwo nzi uko asa.
But not soon.	Ariko si vuba.
I was really.	Nari mubyukuri rwose.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
Anything you need, he can get.	Ikintu cyose ukeneye, arashobora kubona.
The child is sitting on the floor nearby.	Umwana yicaye hasi hafi.
I was scared all day.	Nagize ubwoba umunsi wose.
I am one.	Ndi umwe.
He can defeat all people.	Arashobora gutsinda abantu bose.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
Really let that.	Mubyukuri reka ibyo.
You have to take everyone's opinion.	Ugomba gufata igitekerezo cya buri wese.
In prison.	Muri gereza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo tugomba kuba cyo.
That's all you do.	Ibyo aribyo byose ukora.
But we have a lot of friends here.	Ariko dufite inshuti nyinshi hano.
No one.	Nta muntu.
I was a young man.	Nari umusore.
You have to stick to it.	Ugomba kuguma kuri yo.
You have to be out here.	Ugomba kuba hanze aha.
He looked down with fear.	Yarebye hasi afite ubwoba.
Very good for.	Nibyiza cyane kuri.
He went too far.	Yagiye hanze cyane.
I need to know what it is.	Nkeneye kumenya icyo aricyo.
I like to carry that thing.	Nkunda gutwara icyo kintu.
But a woman.	Ariko umugore.
But recently.	Ariko vuba aha.
For me, that is not all.	Kuri njye, ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It is not a short time.	Ntabwo ari igihe gito.
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
Now we have to see that.	Ubu tugomba kubona ibyo.
And in the end.	Kandi amaherezo.
He never did anything.	Ntabwo yigeze agira icyo akora.
I need to go.	Nkeneye kugenda.
Here he also had hair.	Hano na we yari afite umusatsi.
He was a hard worker.	Yari umuntu ukora cyane.
He was now thirty years old.	Ubu yari afite imyaka mirongo itatu.
I'm not sure what that is.	Sinzi neza icyo aricyo.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nawe.
Especially after watching a movie.	Cyane cyane nyuma yo kureba firime.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
I mean, like.	Ndashaka kuvuga, nka.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
All he wanted was a child.	Icyo yashakaga ni umwana.
I just don't know how to do it.	Gusa sinzi kubikora.
He came to help.	Yaje gufasha.
One day he was gone.	Umunsi umwe yari yagiye.
Something went wrong.	Hariho amakosa.
You have to listen.	Ugomba kumva.
But I can't find a job.	Ariko sinshobora kubona akazi.
I like to learn things.	Nkunda kwiga ibintu.
Children at school.	Abana bari ku ishuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was all about me.	Yari byose kuri njye.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
In, like, a day.	Muri, nka, umunsi.
He didn't want to talk to you on the phone.	Ntiyashakaga kuvugana nawe kuri terefone.
This is a long time coming.	Iki ni igihe kirekire.
One thing we can do.	Ikintu kimwe dushobora gukora.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
However, we need to learn to learn.	Ariko, dukeneye kwiga kwiga.
And it was all his fault.	Kandi byose byari amakosa ye.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
You never thought.	Ntabwo wigeze utekereza.
It was a problem.	Wari ikibazo.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
He knew he couldn't go back.	Yari azi ko adashobora gusubira inyuma.
Then he is close.	Icyo gihe ari hafi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
He said he was too young.	Yavuze ko yari akiri muto cyane.
For many of us, it is a long way off.	Kuri benshi muri twe, ni kure cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was good to see that.	Byari byiza kubona ibyo.
He is not alone, alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine, wenyine.
That's really good for me.	Nibyiza rwose kuri njye.
That's exactly what happened.	Ibyo mubyukuri nibyo.
One went ahead.	Umwe yagiye imbere.
It was a great time.	Wari umwanya mwiza.
But it was a good movie.	Ariko yari firime nziza.
It was a lot of things.	Byari ibintu byinshi.
You, and me.	Wowe, hamwe nanjye.
And that was a really good thing.	Kandi ibyo byari ibintu byiza rwose.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It was a problem.	Byari ikibazo.
Probably not his father.	Birashoboka ko atari se.
He loves people.	Akunda abantu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byinshi cyane.
You can't think straight.	Ntushobora gutekereza neza.
He has to speak.	Agomba kuvuga.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
This person has the same problem as you.	Uyu muntu afite ikibazo kimwe nawe.
They were one young man.	Bari umusore umwe.
He needed to stay here.	Yari akeneye kuguma hano.
I'm not happy about that, obviously.	Ntabwo nishimiye ibi, biragaragara.
Just a question.	Ikibazo gusa.
In this Truth.	Muri iyi Kuri.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
I'm not sure what he meant.	Sinzi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
Probably his teacher.	Birashoboka ko umwarimu we.
It was good for us.	Kuri twe byari byiza.
One came to him.	Umwe yaje kuri we.
But he was here.	Ariko yari hano.
He was so happy.	Yishimiye cyane kuki.
In fact, it could be worse.	Mubyukuri, arashobora kuba mubi.
There was not much in the house for breakfast.	Nta byinshi byari mu nzu byo kurya mu gitondo.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
He came to ask for help.	Yaje gusaba ubufasha.
I don’t want to do anything about this.	Sinshaka kugira icyo nkora kuri ibi.
Well done so far for us.	Gukora neza kugeza ubu kuri twe.
This is the time.	Uyu ni umwanya.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
If you need help, here we are.	Ukeneye ubufasha, turi hano.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
The young man wanted to know what it was.	Umusore yashakaga kumenya icyo aricyo.
You really can't.	Ntushobora rwose.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
Also, that's not what you want.	Ikindi kandi ntabwo aribyo ushaka.
Now no one.	Ubu nta n'umwe.
.	.
I hope he does.	Ndizera ko azabikora.
He just went.	Yagiye gusa.
I should have done better with him.	Nari nkwiye gukora neza na we.
One is not.	Umwe ntabwo.
Reka.	Reka.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
They have money.	Bafite amafaranga.
This time he was lucky.	Iki gihe yagize amahirwe.
But, yesterday was a good day for me.	Ariko, ejo wari umunsi mwiza kuri njye.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
They were all there.	Bose bari aho.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I can't figure out the problem.	Sinshobora kumenya ikibazo.
No one had ever heard of it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari wigeze yumva.
You have to study.	Ugomba kwiga.
All together at all times.	Bose hamwe igihe cyose.
That is not the case with everyone.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri bose.
Not at this time.	Ntabwo ari iki gihe.
Especially as it happened.	Cyane cyane uko byagenze.
It is possible, but it is possible.	Birashoboka, ariko birashoboka.
Time to look.	Igihe cyo kureba.
And it worked out as well as possible.	Kandi byagenze neza uko bishoboka.
I hope you can do something good today.	Nizere ko ushobora gukora ibintu byiza uyu munsi.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
That was exactly what he needed to hear.	Ibyo ni byo yari akeneye kumva.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
We are all human.	Twese turi abantu.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu, nta n'umwe ushobora.
This one.	Uyu.
That person.	Uwo muntu.
But I am the only one.	Ariko uwo ni njye wenyine.
We needed to talk to someone who did it.	Twari dukeneye kuvugana numuntu wabikoze.
But he never claimed to be me.	Ariko ntiyigeze avuga ko ari njye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka kuri twese vuba.
I just think he will do it.	Ndatekereza gusa ko azabikora.
You can't do it alone.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine.
He just needs a chance.	Akeneye amahirwe gusa.
He came to me with a problem.	Yaje aho ndi afite ikibazo.
But they know it all the time.	Ariko bazi igihe cyose.
And he had a wonderful family.	Kandi yari afite umuryango mwiza cyane.
The child is doing well.	Umwana akora neza.
This is a great day for me.	Uyu ni umunsi mwiza kuri njye.
He has a gift.	Afite impano.
He didn’t know much he could carry.	Ntiyari azi byinshi yashoboraga gutwara.
And in fact, it is.	Kandi mubyukuri, ni.
Just one.	Umwe gusa.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
Really early, really.	Mubyukuri kare, mubyukuri.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
I heard the idea.	Numvise igitekerezo.
And it really was.	Kandi byari ibintu rwose.
But he would not see any of that.	Ariko ntiyari kubona kimwe muri ibyo.
We all needed that.	Twese twari dukeneye ibyo.
He also told friends a friend.	Yabwiye kandi inshuti inshuti.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
He said there was nothing wrong with that.	Yavuze ko nta kibi.
He must hear.	Agomba kumva.
He never said anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze avuga.
He said a lot of good things.	Yavuze ibintu byiza byinshi.
I have many and many problems.	Mfite ibibazo byinshi kandi byinshi.
He looked outside.	Yarebye hanze.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
That's not what he wants to hear.	Ntabwo aribyo ashaka kumva.
He is behind.	Ari inyuma.
It had finally come.	Amaherezo yari yaje.
Most of us.	Benshi muri twe.
First of all, there are clothes.	Mbere na mbere, hari imyenda.
Or maybe he took the bus.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yafashe bisi.
They all knew why they were here.	Bose bari bazi impamvu bari hano.
Not bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi.
That's like him.	Ibyo ni nka we.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
I want to go too.	Nanjye ndashaka kugenda.
It was good later.	Byari byiza nyuma.
Everything was fine from then on.	Byose byari byiza kuva aho.
He knew a lot.	Yari azi byinshi.
I can't stay.	Ninjye adashobora kuguma.
I think he has problems.	Ntekereza ko afite ibibazo.
We can never.	Ntidushobora na rimwe.
There are dogs outside.	Hano hari imbwa hanze.
Outside.	Hanze.
Tomorrow is good.	Ejo ni byiza.
It is better to do the work.	Nibyiza gukora akazi.
He was young, very handsome, and just dressed.	Yari muto, mwiza cyane, kandi yambaye gusa.
He thought well.	Yatekereje neza.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
But sometimes it’s good to go.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe ni byiza kugenda.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
It would all be easy.	Byose byaba byoroshye.
After working again.	Nyuma yo kongera gukora.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Gusa sinzi uburyo bwo gukora.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
Sometimes, it is possible.	Rimwe na rimwe, birashoboka.
I didn't see much.	Ntabwo nabonye neza cyane.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
But in reality things are not so easy.	Ariko mubyukuri ibintu ntabwo byoroshye cyane.
His problem is his alone.	Ikibazo cye ni we wenyine.
However, that is not all.	Ariko, ibyo sibyo byose.
He did it enough.	Yabikoze bihagije.
I have to learn that.	Ngomba kwiga ibyo.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
I'm glad it happened, actually.	Nishimiye uburyo byagenze, mubyukuri.
Any of them.	Icyo ari cyo cyose muri byo.
I'm not sure if that is the case.	Sinzi neza ko aribyo.
I don't know where he is.	Ntazi iyo ari.
I know exactly what it is.	Nzi neza icyo aricyo.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
In fact, it was good.	Mubyukuri, byari byiza.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, icyo yashakaga gutekereza ni we.
He really had it for me.	Yari afite rwose kuri njye.
He did not have much luck.	Ntabwo yari afite amahirwe menshi.
She was not a girl to him.	Ntabwo yari umukobwa kuri we.
Only now very little.	Gusa ubu gato cyane.
Time is of the essence.	Igihe ni igihe.
Probably today.	Birashoboka ko muri iki gihe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibi byagenze neza.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I saw nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe nabonye.
But that’s not enough.	Ariko ntabwo bihagije bihagije.
I wanted to do it right.	Nashakaga kubikora neza.
He has to do it.	Agomba kubikora.
I'm glad to go.	Nishimiye kugenda.
Good teacher.	Umwarimu mwiza.
He was very young.	Yari akiri muto cyane.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
He had not seen the reason for his existence.	Ntiyari yabonye impamvu yo kubaho.
Everyone feels alone and alone.	Umuntu wese yumva ari wenyine kandi wenyine.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
We have to go all the time.	Tugomba kugenda igihe cyose.
The problems were, they weren't enough.	Ibibazo byari, ntabwo byari bihagije.
Behind him.	Inyuma ye.
That is my advice.	Iyo ni inama yanjye.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
A lot of thinking.	Kinini kinini cyo gutekereza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
She seems to be feeling something.	Asa nkaho yumva ikintu.
We have to say a lot.	Tugomba kuvuga byinshi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
When you do nothing.	Mugihe ntacyo ukora.
But sometimes it is possible.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.
They were close.	Bari hafi.
You can stay home.	Urashobora kuguma murugo.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kubikora.
And as usual, he didn't have much to ask for.	Kandi nkuko bisanzwe, ntabwo yari afite byinshi byo gusaba.
You want the truth.	Urashaka ukuri.
If not, it is not.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo.
He was not worried.	Ntiyari afite impungenge.
He also heard.	Yumvise kandi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we ashobora kuba.
It's another morning.	Ni ikindi gitondo.
At any time.	Igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
I have to learn that on the bus now.	Ngomba kwiga ibyo muri bisi ubu.
Probably outside.	Birashoboka ko ari hanze.
Walking, like him.	Kugenda, nka we.
But good.	Ariko nziza.
Anything.	Ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
I had no reason.	Nta mpamvu nari mfite.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
But he also wants to know the truth.	Ariko arashaka kandi kumenya ukuri.
This one went quickly.	Iyi yagiye vuba.
You can quit your job.	Urashobora kureka akazi.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
But he knew he was scared.	Ariko yari azi ko afite ubwoba.
Especially not later.	Cyane cyane ntabwo nyuma.
In good time	Mugihe cyiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
You know exactly what it is.	Uzi neza icyo aricyo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You can try.	Urashobora kugerageza.
So many things.	Ibintu byinshi cyane.
Things outside of me.	Ibintu hanze yanjye.
Now every week.	Ubu buri cyumweru.
It is my family.	Ni umuryango wanjye.
You probably had the truth.	Birashoboka ko wari ufite ukuri.
And that's not what he says.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo avuga.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We needed more.	Twari dukeneye byinshi.
I guess there is.	Ndakeka ko ahari.
And that is all.	Kandi ibyo aribyo byose.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Only now he needed more time.	Gusa ubu yari akeneye igihe kinini.
This is not the case now.	Ubu sibyo.
I don't mean to say.	Ntashaka kuvuga.
I guess that's possible.	Ndakeka ko bishoboka.
He can’t believe his luck.	Ntashobora kwizera amahirwe ye.
Everyone should look at this.	Umuntu wese agomba kureba kuri ibi.
I was everything.	Nari byose.
And there was a lot going on.	Kandi hari byinshi byari hafi.
Someone to look after you.	Umuntu wo kureba inyuma yawe.
We are all together now.	Twese hamwe ubu.
And a wise woman may do her work.	Kandi umugore uzi ubwenge arashobora gukora imyenda ye.
They were very good friends.	Bari inshuti nziza cyane.
You really are.	Nukuri uri.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyo akora.
We are not living here.	Ntabwo turi aba hano.
She will be beautiful.	Azaba mwiza.
Well, not today, but soon.	Nibyiza, ntabwo uyu munsi, ariko vuba.
You have to play well.	Ugomba gukina neza.
He was very good at that.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri ibyo.
I think he likes the idea.	Ntekereza ko akunda igitekerezo.
He was probably expecting this.	Birashoboka ko yari yiteze ibi.
And you have good things.	Kandi ufite ibintu byiza.
That we were close.	Ko twari hafi.
She says she is very young and may want to have more children.	Avuga ko akiri muto cyane kandi ko ashobora gushaka abana benshi.
I have nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe mfite.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
That's right.	Nibyo nibyo.

You are the only one for me.	Ni wowe wenyine kuri njye.
No, obviously.	Ntabwo aribyo, biragaragara.

It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He had many friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
Everyone is gone.	Buri wese yagiye.

He could have done more.	Yashoboraga gukora byinshi.
I'm not sure what.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
He may have his time.	Ashobora kugira igihe cye.
We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
No one had seen it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari wabonye.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
They have no truth.	Nta kuri bafite.
No one has a problem with that.	Nta muntu ufite ikibazo kuri ibyo.
I can't figure out why.	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya impamvu ibyo aribyo.
He has worked for many of us.	Yakoze kuri benshi muri twe.
John at the time.	Yohana icyo gihe.
I had them all.	Nari mfite bose.
I never heard of that.	Sinigeze numva ibyo.
He didn't have that.	Ntabwo yari afite ibyo.
He seemed to enjoy being in prison.	Yasaga naho yishimiye kuba muri gereza.
Sometimes it’s something else.	Rimwe na rimwe ni ikindi kintu.
They were here.	Hano bari hano.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo ari cyo.
He did it very well.	Yabikoze neza cyane.
I have to work.	Ngomba gukora.
I think he was really alone.	Ntekereza ko mubyukuri yari wenyine.
This will be a great experience.	Ibi bizaba ibintu byiza cyane.
I know he enjoys this.	Nzi ko yishimiye ibi.
Good reason.	Impamvu nziza.
But he tried.	Ariko yagerageje.
He is very young.	Ari muto cyane.
But that's fine.	Ariko nibyiza.
Absolutely that.	Ibyo rwose.
Here we have what we need.	Hano dufite ibyo dukeneye.
Anyone can tell anyone, anytime.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese, igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
Drink regularly.	Kunywa buri gihe.
I don't want to either.	Nanjye sinshaka.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
Good father son.	Umuhungu wa se neza.
I don't think you should be around me.	Ntabwo mbona ko ukwiye kuba hafi yanjye.
Drinking or a small child.	Kunywa cyangwa umwana muto.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Ntiyari azi icyo yatekerezaga.
Sometimes that is true.	Rimwe na rimwe ibyo ni ukuri.
I do not.	Ntabwo nkora.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He must be able to do it outside.	Agomba kuba ashobora kubikora hanze.
At the same time, we must take the right time.	Igihe kimwe, tugomba gufata umwanya ukwiye.
He didn't want to be here.	Ntiyashakaga kuba hano.
I didn't hear anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe numvise.
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
He can wait.	Arashobora gutegereza.
Working is not as good as it can be.	Gukora ntabwo ari byiza bishoboka.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
One time the same thing.	Umwanya umwe ikintu kimwe.
The woman loved the house.	Umugore yakundaga inzu.
I needed to know more.	Nari nkeneye kumenya byinshi.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
Maybe walking was good.	Ahari kugenda byari byiza.
How can you stop this.	Nigute ushobora guhagarika ibi.
It is very good and very good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza cyane.
Only.	Gusa.
Today at the time of.	Uyu munsi mugihe cya.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
You want to know why.	Urashaka kumenya impamvu.
He has to go until morning.	Agomba kugenda kugeza mu gitondo.
Gone, gone, gone.	Yagiye, yagiye, yagiye.
He was at home here.	Yari murugo hano.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
He could say what he wanted.	Yashoboraga kuvuga icyo ashaka.
This is a great plan.	Iyi ni gahunda nziza.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
A woman can never.	Umugore ntashobora na rimwe.
There is something else here.	Hano hari ikindi kintu.
It's all your fault.	Byose ni amakosa yawe.
It was not always going to happen.	Ntabwo buri gihe byari kugenda.
Since then, no one.	Kuva icyo gihe, nta n'umwe.
He thought he had a good chance of winning.	Yatekereje ko afite amahirwe menshi yo gutsinda.
I can't think of anything better to do.	Ntashobora gutekereza ku kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
The only problem is that it is not true.	Ikibazo gusa nuko atari ukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Nothing.	Ntacyo ari cyo.
You like to think before you speak.	Ukunda gutekereza mbere yo kuvuga.
I knew inside.	Nari nzi imbere.
I was not an expert.	Ntabwo nari umuhanga.
He knew where he was.	Yari azi aho ari.
He just doesn't do well in reality.	Gusa ntabwo akora neza mubyukuri.
You can't stay ahead.	Ntushobora kuguma imbere.
But he had to give up in the end.	Ariko yagombaga kureka amaherezo.
You don't know where you are.	Ntabwo uzi aho uri.
I hope she is very nice.	Ndizera ko ari mwiza cyane.
I told them they were here.	Mbwira ko bari hano.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Everyone has to do their own thing.	Umuntu wese agomba gukora ibyo wenyine.
Waiting on the phone.	Gutegereza kuri terefone.
It is all one person.	Byose ni umuntu umwe.
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari impamvu nziza.
I am a good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza.
I always want to do something else.	Buri gihe nshaka gukora ikindi kintu.
And he is not very young.	Kandi ntabwo akiri muto cyane.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko abikora.
We have to go now.	Tugomba kugenda ubu.
I hope it's good now.	Ndizera ko ari byiza ubu.
You can definitely.	Urashobora rwose.
Just trying.	Kugerageza gusa.
He seems to know a lot.	Asa naho azi byinshi.
He would know where to go from here.	Yari kumenya aho agomba kuva hano.
But that is not the case here or here.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
He was behind her.	Yari inyuma ye.
What? 	Kinini?
However, you can.	Ariko, urashobora.
That's exactly what he did.	Nibyo rwose yakoze.
It was great to see my daughter for so long.	Byari byiza kubona umukobwa wanjye igihe kirekire.
Well, we can say that now.	Nibyo, dushobora kuvuga ubu.
It was good to go well.	Byari byiza kugenda neza.
Not enough to eat.	Ntabwo bihagije kurya.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
It was a lot.	Byari byinshi.
After all, it is only for a short time.	Nyuma ya byose, ni mugihe gito.
Being alone is not a problem for me.	Kuba wenyine ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri njye.
I really want to study.	Ndashaka cyane kwiga.
This time however.	Iki gihe ariko.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He did nothing.	Ntiyigeze agira icyo akora.
And that is very true today.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri cyane muri iki gihe.
At first, it was very easy.	Mbere, byari byoroshye cyane.
He didn’t even know the movie he was going to watch.	Ntiyari azi na firime yari kujya kureba.
These are just people.	Ubu ni abantu gusa.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka, birashoboka.
We have very little time.	Dufite igihe gito cyane.
And you were.	Kandi wari.
He was my man.	Yari umuntu wanjye.
Everyone seems to know something.	Umuntu wese asa nkaho azi ikintu.
That's not a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
You know you want to see.	Uzi ko ushaka kureba.
You don't have to be.	Ntugomba no kuba.
He came well.	Yaje neza.
He needs his time.	Akeneye umwanya we.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine wenyine.
This is his first book.	Iki ni igitabo cye cya mbere.
You have to find my house.	Ugomba kubona inzu yanjye.
He said some very good things.	Yavuze ibintu byiza cyane.
But that is not true.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
That's exactly what happened.	Nibyo rwose byari ukuri.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
Especially.	Cyane cyane.
He didn't know the boy.	Ntabwo yari azi umuhungu.
She loved her dog.	Yakundaga imbwa ye.
I know you can do it.	Nzi ko ushobora kubikora.
It was not a problem at all.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo rwose.
The day as you like.	Umunsi uko ukunda.
Longevity.	Kuba igihe kirekire.
We are not children.	Ntabwo turi abana.
One has to learn.	Umwe ugomba kwiga.
It wouldn't help.	Ntabwo byari gufasha.
We don't need it now.	Ntabwo dukeneye ubu.
You can't wait to see what you do.	Ntushobora gutegereza kureba icyo ukora.
It's just here, right now.	Hano hari hano gusa, ubu.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi sibyo.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
Who has	Ninde ufite.
I have to do it again.	Ngomba kongera kubikora.
I hope you can do the same.	Ndizera ko nawe ushobora kubikora.
And he could see why.	Kandi yashoboraga kubona impamvu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But not all.	Ariko si byose.
Everything was fine there.	Byose byari byiza aho.
It is also a problem.	Ni ikibazo kandi.
Food was just food.	Ibiryo byari ibiryo gusa.
However, they all have one or more problems.	Ariko, bose bafite ikibazo kimwe cyangwa byinshi.
If we are lucky.	Niba dufite amahirwe.
That won't be me.	Ibyo ntabwo bizaba njye.
I want to learn more about hearing.	Ndashaka byinshi byo kwiga kumva.
I don't want to drive.	Sinshaka gutwara.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kuri ibyo.
Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation.	Niki, mubyukuri kimwe.
And nothing wrong.	Kandi nta kintu kibi.
I had thought about it all.	Nari natekereje kuri byose.
If you want to talk, you can.	Niba ushaka kuvuga, urashobora.
That, in fact, she was a girl.	Ko, mubyukuri, yari umukobwa.
He said he had.	Yavuze ko afite.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I really want to get a job.	Ndashaka cyane gufata akazi.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
This is not very good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
There was no one at the time.	Yahoze nta muntu n'umwe icyo gihe.
He got help.	Yabonye ubufasha.
Or maybe it's me.	Cyangwa ahari ni njye.
I wanted to make a big deal.	Nashakaga gukora igitekerezo kinini.
Food and everything.	Ibiryo kandi byose.
He came to ask for advice.	Yaje gusaba inama.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was not my fault at all.	Ntabwo byari amakosa yanjye rwose.
And maybe my son.	Kandi birashoboka ko umuhungu wanjye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo bari benshi.
Very bad idea.	Igitekerezo kibi cyane.
There is no truth.	Nta kuri.
She is so much better than any of us.	Ni mwiza cyane kurenza umwe muri twe.
But that is not all.	Ariko sibyo rwose.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
No one knew where to go.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho agomba kujya.
With i.	Hamwe na i.
I just wanted to know his problem.	Nashakaga gusa kumenya ikibazo cye.
He knows it's his fault.	Azi ko ari amakosa ye.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
But you are too young.	Ariko uri muto cyane.
By now, that was enough.	Kuri ubu, ibyo byari bihagije.
But the same.	Ariko kimwe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yari afite ubwoba.
But he knows exactly what he wants.	Ariko azi neza icyo ashaka.
That's not all there is to it, really.	Ntabwo aribyo byose bisanzwe, mubyukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Only me and him.	Gusa njye na we.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aho ari.
I know what you mean.	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga.
Not really, at all.	Ntabwo ari rwose, nta na gato.
I got back to work.	Nabonye gusubira ku kazi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Obviously not my fault.	Biragaragara ko atari amakosa yanjye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byoroshye kubyo ukeneye.
I think it will be good.	Ntekereza ko bizaba byiza.
Maybe he is.	Birashoboka ko ari we.
No one has ever done that.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
This is the same.	Iki ni kimwe.
The inside and outside had to be one.	Imbere no hanze yagombaga kuba umwe.
He doesn't have much.	Ntabwo afite byinshi.
He didn't tell me what had happened.	Ntabwo yambwiye uko byagenze.
There is no need to be a bad person.	Nta mpamvu yo kuba umuntu mubi.
Things have been going well since the beginning.	Ibintu byagenze neza kuva mbere.
He had a lot of problems.	Yari afite ibibazo cyane.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
That would have been difficult for everything.	Ibyo byari kuba bigoye ibintu byose.
I love people.	Nkunda abantu.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
She is obviously young and very beautiful.	Biragaragara ko ari muto kandi mwiza cyane.
Anyway, good food.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ibiryo byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ikintu kimwe kibi cyane.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
But the space here is short.	Ariko umwanya hano ni muto.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
But all was well.	Ariko byose byari byiza.
But you are the only one.	Ariko ni wowe wenyine.
You didn't say anything wrong.	Ntacyo wavuze nabi.
It was good for both of them.	Byari byiza kuri bombi.
I don't want to go now.	Sinshaka kugenda nonaha.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
I know what you must be thinking.	Nzi icyo ugomba kuba utekereza.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
I should have done more.	Nari nkwiye gukora byinshi.
You can't live.	Ntushobora kubaho.
That was all.	Ibyo byari byose.
And it is very high.	Kandi ni hejuru cyane.
I didn't know that.	Sinari nzi ibyo.
I think it's close.	Ntekereza ko ari hafi.
It was a lot for him.	Byari byinshi kuri we.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
It doesn't look like it.	Ntabwo usa.
I think it's possible.	Ntekereza ko bishoboka.
This is not a difficult thing.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bigoye.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I know you can.	Nzi ko ushobora.
He doesn’t need problems.	Ntabwo akeneye ibibazo.
He thought it was today.	Yatekereje ko ari uyu munsi.
The book is great.	Igitabo ni cyiza.
You did it.	Wabikoze.
None of us were alone.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wigeze kuba wenyine.
I'm glad you're beautiful.	Nishimiye ko uri mwiza.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
In any case, we have to live.	Ibyo ari byo byose, tugomba kubaho.
We have that.	Dufite ibyo.
Meditation and meditation.	Gutekereza no gutekereza.
But he knew it was true.	Ariko yari azi ko ari ukuri.
But that's just me.	Ariko ibyo ni njye gusa.
Well, not this morning.	Nibyo, ntabwo muri iki gitondo.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu cyo kuvuga.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari byinshi byo kubona.
He was here this morning.	Yari hano muri iki gitondo.
His father never did.	Se ntiyigeze abikora.
He did not want help.	Ntiyashakaga ubufasha.
That would be it today.	Ibyo byaba ari uyu munsi.
After all.	Buri nyuma.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu ibyo.
And it is very clear to him.	Kandi biragaragara cyane kuri we.
And very much.	Kandi cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It looks good.	Birasa naho ari byiza.
You need	Ukeneye .
No one has seen it before.	Nta muntu n'umwe wabonye mbere.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
It was great out here.	Byari byiza hano hanze.
I don’t find the time alone.	Ntabwo mbona umwanya wenyine wenyine.
This is just one person.	Uyu ni umuntu umwe gusa.
I thought you were.	Natekereje ko uri.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
That's not a bad idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi.
Existence is imminent.	Kubaho ni hafi.
And that worked out well.	Kandi ibyo byagenze neza.
He didn't need to.	Ntiyari akeneye.
He is currently working on his first book.	Kuri ubu arimo gukora igitabo cye cya mbere.
These are just kids.	Aba ni abana gusa.
This is not a family.	Uyu ntabwo ari umuryango.
And it was true.	Kandi byari ukuri.
He had problems.	Yari afite ibibazo.
He really did go.	Yagiye rwose.
He knew he could do it.	Yari azi ko yashoboraga kubikora.
And he was, and was.	Kandi yari, kandi yari.
You don’t have to do everything on your own.	Ntugomba gukora byose wenyine.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yari ubwoba.
Out on top.	Hanze hejuru.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
He had been there for a long time.	Yari amaze igihe kirekire.
But that's really good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza rwose.
Long retreat.	Gusubira inyuma igihe kirekire.
It's good for us.	Ni byiza kuri twe.
Problems will be good.	Ibibazo bizaba byiza.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
If you think.	Niba utekereza.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
This will not be good.	Ibi ntabwo bizaba byiza.
He told me this.	Yambwiye ibi.
There is.	Hariho.
But that was not enough.	Ariko ntabwo byari bihagije.
If so, we are many.	Niba aribyo, turi benshi.
He never had time.	Ntiyigeze agira umwanya.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But no one said much.	Ariko nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
But that's exactly what he did.	Ariko, ibyo ni byo yakoze byose.
A little time.	Umwanya muto.
We were all bad.	Twese twari mubi.
This is not your time.	Uyu ntabwo ari umwanya wawe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I had a good idea.	Nari mfite igitekerezo cyiza.
He thought that was good.	Yatekereje ko ibyo byari byiza.
One person told everything.	Umuntu umwe yabwiye byose.
You do nothing.	Ntacyo ukora.
He would not be alone.	Ntiyari kuba wenyine.
I thought so.	Natekereje neza ko aribyo.
He is taking time.	Arimo gufata umwanya.
He should have known the young man probably not alone.	Yari akwiye kumenya umusore birashoboka ko atari wenyine.
He didn't look good this morning.	Ntabwo yari asa neza muri iki gitondo.
We can't wait.	Ntabwo dushobora gutegereza.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yamenye.
If so, that's a good idea.	Niba aribyo, ni igitekerezo cyiza.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekereje.
But that was good.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza.
I was not.	Ntabwo nari.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
I did the same.	Ninjye wabikoze.
At the same time, there is.	Igihe kimwe, hariho.
However, it is very good.	Ariko, ni byiza cyane.
But most of all.	Ariko cyane cyane.
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
I know the truth.	Nzi ukuri icyo aricyo.
Absolutely wise.	Ubwenge rwose.
She loves her teacher.	Akunda umwarimu we.
He loved food.	Yakundaga ibiryo.
At this house.	Kuri iyi nzu.
He was obviously a good man.	Biragaragara ko yari umuntu mwiza.
Everyone was very skilled.	Umuntu wese yari umuhanga cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He just went.	Yagiye gusa.
They are not on my agenda.	Ntabwo bari muri gahunda yanjye.
He didn't say much.	Ntiyigeze avuga cyane.
I can't give up.	Sinshobora kureka.
There is only one thing we can do now.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa dushobora gukora ubu.
What he did.	Icyo yakoze.
From here on out, things were easier.	Kuva hano naho, ibintu byari byoroshye.
I heard him speak.	Numvise avuga.
This was everyone.	Uyu yari abantu bose.
I guess he was right.	Ndakeka ko yari afite ukuri.
Not just dogs.	Ntabwo ari imbwa gusa.
You didn't do it.	Ntabwo wabikoze.
You have to talk to me.	Ugomba kuvugana nanjye.
He was going to be beautiful.	Yari agiye kuba mwiza.
And you don't have to do that.	Kandi ntugomba kubikora.
In fact, it's all about getting things done.	Mubyukuri, byose ni uburyo bwo kubona ibintu.
This is not very good now.	Ubu ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
But for now you have to think.	Ariko kuri ubu ugomba gutekereza.
I guess 	Ndakeka?
This is not a mistake.	Ibi ntabwo ari amakosa.
He was not close to her.	Ntabwo yari hafi ye.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	Kandi nta kintu ushobora gukora.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
She was my daughter.	Yari umukobwa wanjye.
He didn't really expect her to leave.	Ntabwo yari yiteze rwose ko agenda.
Well, we had something to eat.	Nibyo, twari dufite icyo kurya.
It would not be good for him.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza kuri we.
Everything was great.	Ibintu byose byari byiza cyane.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora, sinshobora, sinshobora.
He said badly.	Yavuze nabi.
Trying to do good things.	Kugerageza gukora ibintu byiza.
Everyone wants money.	Umuntu wese arashaka amafaranga.
That's not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
We are human beings before.	Turi abantu mbere.
And he did a good job of looking at it.	Kandi yakoze ibyo kureba neza.
Playing is good.	Gukina ni byiza.
That was just fine.	Ibyo byari byiza gusa.
He did not want to know everything about her.	Ntiyashakaga kumenya byose kuri we.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I want to know if this is possible.	Ndashaka kumenya niba bishoboka.
I have to get more.	Ngomba kubona byinshi.
We are very close to that.	Turi hafi cyane kubyo.
There is a car, but very far away.	Hari imodoka, ariko kure cyane.
I was in school.	Nari mu ishuri.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
There is something to look forward to.	Hariho ikintu cyo gutegereza.
I'm really bad.	Ndi mubi rwose.
I would like to have a plan.	Ndashaka kubona gahunda.
But you have to try.	Ariko ugomba kugerageza.
None of us have.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ufite.
They were close friends.	Bari hafi inshuti.
There is always a reason.	Buri gihe hariho impamvu.
And that worked out well.	Kandi ibyo byagenze neza.
It wasn’t too much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi cyane.
He was about to give up everything.	Yari hafi kureka byose.
For someone like me.	Ku muntu nkanjye.
He is alone.	Ni wenyine.
I hear every child.	Ndumva umwana wese.
This is not an easy task.	Iki ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
Bose.	Bose.
He needs something else.	Akeneye ikindi kintu.
He may know someone.	Ashobora kumenya umuntu.
As he was going home.	Nkuko yari agiye murugo.
We have a way.	Dufite uburyo.
You really got your time.	Wabonye rwose umwanya wawe.
I don't feel too big.	Ntabwo numva ikintu kinini cyane.
But he heard nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yumvise.
I like the idea.	Nkunda igitekerezo.
I mean, it's good.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari mwiza.
This was the case.	Ibi byari ibintu.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
He went back.	Yagiye inyuma.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
And very good.	Kandi nziza cyane.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, byoroshye bihagije.
You don't even have to leave the house.	Ntugomba no kuva mu nzu.
I am the only family he has here.	Ndi umuryango wenyine afite hano.
He had his car.	Yari afite imodoka ye.
I was actually.	Nari mubyukuri.
He could have stayed here.	Yashoboraga kuguma hano.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Going to the room.	Kujya mu cyumba.
Age was nothing.	Imyaka ntiyari ikintu.
But that was good.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
They were nothing.	Ntacyo bari cyo.
You know where you are.	Uzi aho uri.
Always a nice house.	Buri gihe inzu nziza.
I'm glad you tried it.	Nishimiye kugerageza neza.
He was not a bad guy.	Ntiyari umusore mubi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
They really are.	Bari rwose.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu, ni byiza.
I never got the idea.	Sinigeze mbona igitekerezo.
He is bad.	Afite nabi.
It was easier to do than to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora kuruta kubikora.
I need something else.	Nkeneye ikindi.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba gukora neza.
I had problems before.	Nagize ibibazo mbere.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
But it is.	Ariko ni.
I was very young at the time.	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
I hope it's good.	Ndizera ko ari byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari gukora neza.
His father was involved.	Se yari arimo.
I want to be the best.	Ndashaka kurenza byose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
No one, in fact, was good enough.	Nta muntu, mubyukuri, wari mwiza bihagije.
He could do it as he pleased.	Yashoboraga kubikora uko ashaka.
They are both.	Ari bombi.
I think that would be nice.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kibi kuri we.
He enjoyed being around.	Yishimiye kuba hafi.
He had many friends.	Yari afite inshuti nyinshi.
But nothing, no one.	Ariko nta kintu, nta muntu.
That's all.	Ibyo ni byose.
It is not a gift.	Ntabwo ari impano.
And who knows what else.	Kandi ninde uzi ikindi.
You work all day.	Ukora umunsi wose.
I was at work.	Nari ku kazi.
Everything is absolutely true.	Byose ni ukuri rwose.
The woman went yesterday.	Umugore yagiye ejo.
Doing so is possible.	Ukora ibyo birashoboka.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He had his children.	Yari afite abana be.
That's right.	Nukuri.
It was a matter of knowing everything.	Byari ikibazo cyo kumenya byose.
He has to be here.	Agomba kuba hano.
I need something better.	Nkeneye ikintu cyiza kuruta ibyo.
I'm not doing anything wrong.	Ntabwo nkora nabi.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
But it was not as good as before.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza nka mbere.
It was really nice to watch.	Byari byiza rwose kureba.
Yes, he could see that.	Nibyo, yashoboraga kubona ibyo.
Normal.	Ibintu bisanzwe.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
It was good but very good.	Byari byiza ariko cyane.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
He asked for a film.	Yasabye firime.
That's a big deal.	Icyo ni ikintu kinini.
If you have money, that's fine.	Niba ufite amafaranga, nibyiza.
He began to think that he knew where he was.	Yatangiye gutekereza ko azi aho ari.
You have to be good.	Ugomba kugira neza.
That's what he wanted to hear.	Icyo ni cyo yashakaga kumva.
I guess this is normal.	Ndakeka ko ibi ari ibintu bisanzwe.
It doesn't look good.	Ntabwo asa neza.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
I don't want to go back.	Sinshaka gusubira inyuma.
To see	Kureba.
Good gift.	Impano nziza.
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
That is not true at all.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri rwose.
I didn't know it would be so good.	Ntabwo nari nzi ko byaba ari ibintu byiza cyane.
I saw as much as possible.	Nabonye uko bishoboka.
Learning was easy for him.	Kwiga byari byoroshye kuri we.
Something he knew he had to do.	Ikintu yari azi ko agomba gukora.
It would be nice if someone had any idea.	Byaba byiza umuntu afite igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose.
You're going to do it.	Ugiye kubikora.
Here, that's fine.	Hano, nibyiza.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
Much is true.	Byinshi ni ukuri.
He had to.	Yagombaga.
He lives nearby.	Aba hafi.
'	'
He said he did not.	Yavuze ko atabikoze.
It really was.	Byari ibintu rwose.
Reka.	Reka.
It is better to do well.	Nibyiza gukora neza.
You used to live alone.	Wigeze kubaho wenyine.
I never saw many.	Sinigeze mbona benshi.
The car is great.	Imodoka ni nziza.
Women.	Akazi.
He had a job in the morning.	Yari afite akazi mu gitondo.
Someone had to do something.	Umuntu yagombaga gukora ikintu.
They have problems all the time.	Bafite ibibazo igihe cyose.
I knew it all.	Nari nzi ko byose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I have a job to do here.	Mfite akazi ko gukora hano.
He knew exactly where he was.	Yari azi neza aho ari.
He didn't want to go.	Ntabwo yashakaga kugenda.
This is definitely possible.	Ibi rwose birashoboka.
He feels he knows what he means.	Yumva azi icyo ashaka kuvuga.
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari, kuri njye.
You have to be alone.	Ugomba kuba wenyine.
He just wanted to say what he said.	Yashakaga kuvuga gusa ibyo yavuze.
He said.	Yavuze ko.
That’s not a good reason.	Iyo si impamvu nziza.
He even started eating.	Yatangiye no kurya.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I think we all have.	Ntekereza ko twese dufite.
He didn't want to see any of that.	Ntabwo yashakaga kubona kimwe muri byo.
I'm glad to hear that.	Nishimiye kumva.
I don't see it, but it's good.	Ntabwo mbona, ariko nibyiza.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
He wanted everything.	Yashakaga byose.
He had heard it all before.	Yumvise byose mbere.
Or for one.	Cyangwa kuri kimwe.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
It's good too.	Ni mwiza kandi.
It's good for me.	Ni mwiza kuri njye.
How can we do that.	Nigute dushobora kubikora.
Inside me.	Imbere muri njye.
Almost everyone.	Abantu hafi ya bose.
But here it is good, too.	Ariko hano ni byiza, kandi.
I know a little girl.	Nzi umukobwa muto.
People.	Abantu.
He thought he was too, he should have been.	Yibwiraga ko na we ari, yagombaga kuba.
We had none.	Nta n'umwe twari dufite.
He thought that in the morning.	Yatekereje ko mu gitondo.
I have to go back to this room later.	Ngomba gusubira muri iki cyumba nyuma.
He didn't want anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga.
It seems to be.	Birasa nkaho ari.
Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko ni byiza.
But this was easy.	Ariko ibi byari byoroshye.
Tell everyone everything.	Bwira abantu bose ibintu byose.
He doesn't want to eat anything.	Ntabwo yifuza kurya ikintu na kimwe.
What can we do to help?	Ni iki dushobora gufasha.
More than children.	Kurenza abana.
He looked frightened.	Yarebye afite ubwoba.
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
No one knew or anyone.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese.
The dog was on top.	Imbwa yari hejuru.
So far everything was working.	Kugeza ubu byari byose byari akazi.
When we have time.	Iyo dufite umwanya.
If he does.	Niba abikora.
New at work.	Nshya mu kazi.
Either tonight, or not at all.	Byaba iri joro, cyangwa sibyo rwose.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
Driving my car.	Gutwara imodoka yanjye.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
At the moment everything is fine.	Kuri ubu byose ni byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
Normal reading.	Gusoma bisanzwe.
You have to go wrong, or.	Ugomba kugenda nabi, cyangwa.
Tom saw a girl.	Tom yabonye umukobwa.
I really needed it.	Nari nkeneye cyane.
The girl looked good.	Umukobwa yasaga neza.
They have, like, nothing.	Bafite, nka, ntacyo.
But in reality, that's fine.	Ariko mubyukuri, nibyiza.
He needs to go.	Akeneye kugenda.
But I can't figure out how.	Ariko sinshobora kumenya uko.
She knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko umusore agomba kurya.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
It was not crowded.	Ntiyari abantu benshi.
When it's good, it's really good.	Iyo ari byiza, nibyiza rwose.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
I should have said something.	Nari nkwiye kuvuga ikintu.
I need to hear the truth.	Nkeneye kumva ukuri.
I know the truth.	Nzi ukuri.
She is so beautiful, so loving.	Ni mwiza cyane, ukunda cyane.
You have no way of knowing what it is.	Ntabwo ufite uburyo bwo kumenya icyo aricyo.
He had a lot in his father in him.	Yari afite byinshi muri se muri we.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
Inside.	Imbere.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
For that matter, you are not a person to me.	Kuri icyo kibazo, ntabwo uri umuntu kuri njye.
I don't want you to do that.	Sinshaka ko ukora.
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
You have to know something.	Ugomba kumenya ikintu.
John needed one and the same.	Yohana yari akeneye kimwe kandi kimwe.
But it's too early.	Ariko ni kare.
The only thing he can see.	Ikintu gusa ashobora kubona.
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
Being who he wanted to be.	Kuba uwo yashakaga kuba.
His wife is really nice.	Umugore we rwose ni mwiza.
His father would have done well.	Se yari kubikora neza.
He knew he had something.	Yari azi ko hari icyo afite.
You can't do it right.	Ntushobora kubikora neza.
As he could see in himself and in him.	Nkuko yashoboraga kubona muri we no muri we.
However, you can only try to survive.	Ariko, urashobora kugerageza kubaho gusa.
Or father.	Cyangwa se.
I have all that.	Mfite ibyo byose.
You did it.	Ni wowe wabikoze.
They don't know why.	Ntabwo bazi impamvu.
He wanted, he wanted.	Yashakaga, yashakaga.
She wants to be with you.	Ashaka kubana nawe.
I have nothing to say now.	Ubu ntacyo nshobora kuvuga.
There is room for both.	Hariho umwanya kuri bombi.
What he had was not what he wanted.	Ibyo yari afite ntabwo yashakaga.
I don't want to be beautiful.	Ntashaka kuba mwiza.
But he was also young.	Ariko na we yari muto.
He loves time alone.	Akunda umwanya wenyine.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
I have to get off the ground.	Ngomba kuva hasi.
I didn't think so.	Sinatekerezaga ko.
In the distance, he hears a lot of people.	Ari kure, yumva abantu benshi.
First of all, in the long run.	Bwa mbere, mugihe kirekire.
Anyone want to try that ?.	Umuntu wese ushaka kugerageza ibyo?.
Not once.	Ntabwo ari rimwe.
He could have gone better.	Yashoboraga kugenda neza.
You want us to be scared.	Urashaka ko dufite ubwoba.
And who knows how old he is.	Kandi ninde uzi imyaka afite.
The day is good.	Umunsi ni mwiza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kuri ibyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari hafi ya hafi.
He was not supposed to work tomorrow.	Ntabwo yagombaga gukora ejo.
Looks like he just loved it.	Birasa nkaho yakundaga gusa.
It was definitely a problem for me.	Rwose byari ikibazo kuri njye.
But thirty years was a long time.	Ariko imyaka mirongo itatu yari igihe kirekire.
He speaks louder than he meant to.	Avuga cyane kuruta uko yashakaga kuvuga.
That's right.	Nukuri.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi.
You have to work up to it.	Ugomba gukora kugeza kuri yo.
Probably better than me.	Birashoboka kundusha.
He was going to do everything.	Yari agiye gukora byose.
I don't understand you or him.	Ntabwo ndumva wowe cyangwa we.
I’m really scared to take something here.	Mfite ubwoba rwose gufata ikintu hano.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
You have a job.	Ufite akazi.
Probably not what you think.	Birashoboka ko atari byo utekereza.
He is obviously one person.	Biragaragara ko ari umuntu umwe.
Home later, if anything.	Murugo nyuma, niba ari byose.
This is for everyone.	Ubu ni umuntu wese wenyine.
You can go back.	Urashobora gusubira inyuma.
What you said	Icyo wavuze.
But that is not what he wants.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo ashaka.
Aba.	Aba.
He never thought.	Ntiyigeze atekereza.
I want something very small.	Ndashaka ikintu gito cyane.
You should always try to do things.	Ugomba buri gihe kugerageza gukora ibintu.
He could have lived.	Yashoboraga kubaho.
He is about to leave.	Ari hafi kugenda.
And let it be.	Kandi reka.
And for no apparent reason.	Kandi nta mpamvu icyo aricyo cyose.
The party, in fact.	Ibirori, mubyukuri.
He believed what he was watching.	Yizeye ibyo arimo kureba.
You have everything here.	Ufite ibintu byose hano.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He knew what he was thinking.	Yari azi ibyo yatekerezaga.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
It's not there.	Ntabwo ari aho.
I needed to catch up.	Nari nkeneye gufata.
It is not a prison.	Ntabwo ari gereza.
I love everything.	Nkunda byose.
You are not sure what it is or what it is.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo aricyo cyangwa icyo aricyo.
This program was.	Iyi gahunda yari.
I was so beautiful.	Nari mwiza cyane.
Everything was fine.	Ibintu byose byari byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I mean, the same.	Ndashaka kuvuga, kimwe.
You don't have to do what you do.	Ntugomba gukora ibyo ukora.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
He has no job.	Nta kazi afite.
You are human.	Uri umuntu.
Reka.	Reka.
You can be the one you want.	Urashobora kuba uwo ushaka.
I know you're scared.	Nzi ko ufite ubwoba.
You are doing well.	Urimo kugira neza.
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
I think this is a good idea.	Ntekereza ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza.
We are behind.	Turi inyuma.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
Please let go.	Nyamuneka reka.
But this is not a good time.	Ariko iki ntabwo ari igihe cyiza.
He was a child who did not want to be alone.	Yari umwana udashaka kuba wenyine.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
Maybe that's all.	Ahari ibyo gusa.
It's normal.	Ni ibintu bisanzwe.
When he was gone.	Igihe yari yagiye.
It was not down.	Ntiyari hasi.
And he will do it.	Kandi azabikora.
I know what he thinks.	Nzi icyo atekereza.
We are all in this room.	Twese muri iki cyumba.
Very good food.	Ibiryo byiza cyane.
That's all we need to know.	Ibyo aribyo byose tugomba kumenya.
Anything you like.	Ikintu cyose ukunda.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, iyi ni ukuri.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I don't want friends.	Ntashaka inshuti.
I'm sad every day.	Mbabajwe buri munsi.
I'm not sure what.	Sinzi neza icyo aricyo cyose.
The young man said nothing.	Umusore ntacyo yavuze.
It wouldn't wait.	Ntabwo byari gutegereza.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze akora.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
Someone had made a mistake.	Umuntu yari yakoze amakosa.
I know my time.	Nzi umwanya wanjye.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
He is what we need.	Niwe dukeneye.
You can try again.	Urashobora kongera kugerageza.
I feel like a movie.	Numva ari firime.
You have about that time.	Ufite hafi icyo gihe.
No one is around.	Nta muntu uri hafi.
And everyone would be involved.	Kandi buri wese yaba arimo.
No one, no one outside.	Nta muntu n'umwe, nta muntu uri hanze.
He did not do it for the first time.	Ntabwo yakoze bwa mbere.
We have to get a car made.	Tugomba kubona gukora imodoka.
Well, inside and out.	Nibyiza, imbere no hejuru.
He looked at his people.	Yarebye abantu be.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
However, it is not a chance.	Ariko, ntabwo ari amahirwe.
He just looked as if he was looking outside.	Yarebye gusa nkaho ashaka hanze.
He just wanted to do something.	Gusa yashakaga kugira icyo akora.
Everyone wants help.	Umuntu wese arashaka ubufasha.
It is not a mistake at all.	Ntabwo ari amakosa rwose.
The food was good.	Kurya byari byiza.
I just did nothing.	Gusa ntacyo nakoze.
He is sitting there.	Yicaye aho.
He may be on his way.	Ashobora kuba arimo kugenda.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
It's good to be with you.	Nibyiza kubana nawe.
But this one is very good.	Ariko iyi ni nziza cyane.
'	'
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
But there was not much they could do.	Ariko nta byinshi bari gukora.
That there is something good in him or her.	Ko hari ikintu cyiza muri we cyangwa kuri we.
But it is in him.	Ariko iri muri we.
Sometimes, that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Rimwe na rimwe, icyo ni cyo kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
It's good and everything is fine.	Nibyiza kandi byose ni byiza.
You can make a lot of money.	Urashobora kubona amafaranga menshi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
But there is work.	Ariko hariho akazi.
She is wearing a little now.	Yambaye gato ubu.
He knew he shouldn't.	Yari azi ko atagomba.
He got it all.	Yabonye byose.
Everyone makes mistakes.	Umuntu wese akora amakosa.
But he thought yesterday.	Ariko yatekereje ejo.
We can't do anything.	Ntidushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I want to live, whatever it is.	Ndashaka kubaho, ibyo aribyo byose.
He would not play.	Ntiyari gukina.
Let me always want more.	Reka reka buri gihe nshaka byinshi.
Her daughter was also very nice.	Umukobwa we na we yari mwiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
What he would say.	Icyo yari kuvuga.
But that is probably what he was going to see.	Ariko birashoboka ko aribyo byose yari agiye kubona.
In the house	Mu nzu.
They have no problem.	Nta kibazo bafite.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
Nothing, nothing.	Nta na kimwe, nta na kimwe.
He was above me.	Yari hejuru yanjye.
That really happened all day.	Ibyo rwose byagenze umunsi wose.
He didn't say much.	Ntiyigeze avuga byinshi.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
Or maybe he didn't.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atabikoze.
I mean everyone.	Ndashaka kuvuga abantu bose.
You can go home now.	Urashobora gutaha nonaha.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I can't live with you.	Sinshobora kubana nawe.
We are very high.	Turi hejuru cyane.
More to learn !.	Byinshi byo kwiga!.
He thought before he spoke.	Yatekereje mbere yo kuvuga.
I can never do this here.	Ibi ntashobora na rimwe kubikora hano.
To say the same.	Kuvuga kimwe.
It is a family.	Ni umuryango.
My luck was in it.	Amahirwe yanjye yari arimo.
He thought he had.	Yatekereje ko afite.
I want you to do this.	Ndashaka ko ukora ibi.
He probably meant it.	Birashoboka ko yashakaga kuvuga.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
He accepted everything.	Yemeye byose.
We are all human.	Twese turi abantu.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
Maybe a little better.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza gato.
He had no plans.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari ateganya.
It was a great idea.	Byari igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
Nearly everything has a lot.	Hafi ya buri kintu cyose ufite byinshi.
Or maybe everyone.	Cyangwa ahari bose.
There is concern here.	Hano hari impungenge.
Not really, but he can.	Ntabwo mubyukuri, ariko arashobora.
If not, well, at least they didn't go down without explaining themselves first.	Niba atari byo, nibyiza, bari gutegereza kugeza umwe.
She is my child.	Ni umwana wanjye.
I thought it was my fault.	Natekereje ko ari amakosa yanjye.
I was looking for something you could see far away.	Nashakaga ikintu ushobora kubona kure.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
I think knowing is a lot.	Ntekereza ko kumenya ari byinshi.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He is here this morning.	Ari hano muri iki gitondo.
I'm sure you are.	Nzi neza ko uri.
I don't want to talk to you	Sinshaka kuvugana nawe.
He was not in this world.	Ntiyari kuri iyi si.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He must learn to speak.	Agomba kwiga kuvuga.
He did it on his own.	Yabikoze wenyine.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
He was the one who was scared.	Uwo ni we yari afite ubwoba.
He also does not work.	Ntabwo kandi akora.
That was up to him.	Ibyo byari kuri we.
But then.	Ariko icyo gihe.
And you never have to go outside.	Kandi nta na rimwe ugomba kujya hanze.
There is a catch.	Hariho gufata.
She loved her son.	Yakundaga umuhungu we.
He didn't have it for a while.	Ntabwo yari afite mugihe gito.
We are all human.	Twese turi abantu.
He obviously did nothing wrong.	Biragaragara ko nta kibi yakoze.
They were not all one thing or another.	Ntabwo bose bari ikintu kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
That's all you need to know right now.	Ibyo aribyo byose ugomba kumenya kuri ubu.
It was a great car to drive.	Yari imodoka nziza yo gutwara.
I ask only one thing.	Ndabaza ikintu kimwe gusa.
It was recently.	Byari vuba aha.
He is not going either.	Ntabwo na we agenda.
I think this is good.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza.
They weren’t very outdoors.	Ntabwo bari hanze cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He was a working man.	Yari umuntu ukora.
It was a little work.	Wari akazi gato.
It's something else you need to know.	Ni ikindi kintu ukeneye kumenya.
I wanted it in me.	Nashakaga muri njye.
He didn't believe it.	Ntabwo yari yizeye.
In fact, very low.	Mubyukuri, hasi cyane.
For me.	Kuri njye.
He is a good dog.	Ni imbwa nziza.
He had a lot of money.	Yari afite amafaranga menshi.
He loves to play.	Akunda gukina.
You can't do everything but you can do something.	Ntushobora gukora byose ariko urashobora gukora ikintu.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
I had nothing.	Nta na kimwe nari mfite.
Maybe a little.	Birashoboka gato.
But that would be a mistake.	Ariko ibyo byaba ari amakosa.
From above.	Kuva hejuru.
You can do it or you can't.	Urashobora kubikora cyangwa ntushobora.
But there is always so much.	Ariko buri gihe hariho byinshi cyane.
I had a gift.	Nari mfite impano.
It's good.	Ndi mwiza.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
I feel lucky.	Ndumva mfite amahirwe.
He was his dog.	Yari imbwa ye.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
But then he came home.	Ariko nyuma yaje gutaha.
.	.
He likes to do it.	Akunda kubikora.
You can't do one or the other.	Ntushobora gukora kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
I can see people all the time.	Nshobora kubona abantu buri gihe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He actually had the truth.	Mubyukuri yari afite ukuri.
He wanted to live a long time.	Yashakaga kubaho igihe kirekire.
It was too high.	Byari hejuru cyane.
I need more.	Nkeneye byinshi.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
He said very low.	Yavuze hasi cyane.
All he had to do was be alone.	Icyo yagombaga gukora ni we wenyine.
I had a lot of luck here.	Nagize amahirwe menshi hano.
You were really, really good.	Wari mwiza rwose, rwose.
We had this.	Twari dufite ibi.
You are doing a lot of good.	Urimo gukora byinshi byiza.
You have to be able to do whatever you want.	Ugomba kuba ushobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
I feel like I have this time.	Ndumva nshaka kugira iki gihe.
We are not close.	Ntabwo turi hafi.
But he really wanted his clothes first.	Ariko yashakaga rwose imyenda ye mbere.
Lots of opportunities with that.	Amahirwe menshi hamwe nibyo.
He said quickly.	Yavuze vuba.
That's all for today.	Ibyo aribyo byose kuri uyu munsi.
Above all, it is early.	Hejuru ya byose, ni kuri kare.
You can't really know what to expect.	Ntushobora rwose kumenya icyo ugomba gutegereza.
Doing things.	Gukora ibintu.
I'm worried about that too.	Nanjye mfite impungenge kuri ibyo.
That would be enough.	Byaba bihagije.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
He has a very beautiful daughter.	Afite umukobwa cyane.
Too much thinking.	Gutekereza cyane.
Almost everything.	Hafi ya byose.
I did not do well.	Ntabwo nakoze neza.
I never thought it would be so difficult.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko byari kuba bigoye cyane.
But in reality, that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri, ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
I feel intimidated by this.	Ndumva mfite ubwoba kuri ibi.
He went to jail.	Yagiye muri gereza.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga cyane.
It wasn't that bad.	Ntabwo byari uko yari mubi.
He can go.	Ashobora kugenda.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
She was a beautiful girl, a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza, umukobwa mwiza.
Maybe that will be enough.	Ahari ibyo bizaba bihagije.
Everyone wants to make a movie.	Umuntu wese arashaka gukora firime.
It's just an idea.	Ni igitekerezo gusa.
It wouldn't be enough here.	Ntabwo yari kuba hano bihagije.
And obviously this.	Kandi biragaragara ko ibi.
And that would be great.	Kandi ibyo byaba byiza.
He may have been in prison.	Ashobora kuba yari muri gereza.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
Whatever went up.	Ibyo ari byo byose yagiye hejuru.
He had already said a lot.	Yari amaze kuvuga byinshi.
You are not included.	Ntabwo urimo.
I was lucky enough to find this room.	Nagize amahirwe yo kubona iki cyumba.
'	'
Today was a very bad day.	Uyu munsi wari mubi cyane.
I am very far behind.	Ndi inyuma cyane.
If so, everyone would do it.	Niba aribyo, abantu bose bari kubikora.
This one is going to do the same.	Uyu agiye gukora kimwe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka gato.
But he also knew that he needed this.	Ariko yari azi kandi ko akeneye ibi.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
And he probably had it.	Kandi birashoboka ko yari afite.
I can't understand why.	Sinshobora kumva impamvu.
He had good things to say.	Yari afite ibintu byiza byo kuvuga.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And you can never, ever tell someone that.	Kandi ntushobora na rimwe, na rimwe kubwira umuntu ibyo.
As if he has something to do with this.	Nkaho afite icyo akora kuri ibi.
Absolutely.	Hafi rwose.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
None of this they know.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo bazi.
Everything was great.	Ibintu byose byari byiza cyane.
It is not very high.	Ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
He could say what he thought.	Yashoboraga kuvuga icyo yatekerezaga.
And that was true enough.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri bihagije.
At that time and now.	Kuri icyo gihe no kuri ubu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
They were friends.	Bari inshuti.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
This one was not.	Uyu ntiyari.
He didn't need to.	Ntiyari akeneye.
She is my favorite.	Niwe nkunda cyane.
Impossible to say.	Ntabwo bishoboka kuvuga.
It’s not a bad thing to do.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi cyo gukora.
My wife went first.	Umugore wanjye yagiye mbere.
And it wasn’t much.	Kandi ntabwo byari byinshi.
They are just friends.	Ni inshuti gusa.
At that time I did not know.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi.
He is alone.	Ari wenyine.
But I'm not sure how.	Ariko sinzi neza kubikora.
Anyone can do something.	Umuntu wese arashobora gukora ikintu.
The baby may be down.	Umwana arashobora kuba hasi.
You have to stop completely.	Ugomba guhagarika rwose.
I see nothing for him.	Ntacyo mbona kuri we.
You think of me, every day for a long time.	Utekereza kuri njye, buri munsi igihe kirekire.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo aribyo.
He needed something, but he didn't know what to do.	Yari akeneye ikintu, ariko ntiyari azi neza icyo.
You can't see something.	Ntushobora kureba ikintu.
We need the truth.	Dukeneye ukuri.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, kuvuga bihagije.
But no one did.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
He knew he had something to do.	Yari azi ko hari icyo yari gukora.
Everything for everyone.	Ibintu byose kuri bose.
Almost always, he thought carefully.	Hafi buri gihe, yatekereje neza.
But the girl was still young.	Ariko umukobwa yari akiri muto.
It looks like me.	Birasa nkanjye.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
She is not a girl.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa.
There is also a.	Hariho hamwe na.
There is so much to live for.	Hariho byinshi byo kubaho.
It would be hard to go back now.	Byaba bigoye gusubira inyuma ubu.
They were there.	Bari aho.
I mean bad.	Ndashaka kuvuga nabi.
In fact, it is highly likely that it was.	Mubyukuri, birashoboka cyane ko byari.
He needs to do something.	Akeneye kugira icyo akora.
No play.	Nta gukina.
Only there.	Gusa aho.
From there, you can make ideas.	Kuva aho, urashobora gukora igitekerezo.
John was young.	Yohana yari muto.
Everything.	Byose.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Yavuze ko ashaka kuvugana nanjye.
It was yesterday.	Yari ejo.
They were out in the crowd.	Bari hanze muri benshi.
Very good in a short time.	Nibyiza cyane mugihe gito.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
That's the boy.	Uwo ni umuhungu.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
He may be alone.	Ashobora kuba wenyine.
And he is really a good player.	Kandi mubyukuri ni umukinnyi mwiza.
Just you and me.	Gusa wowe na njye.
We don’t have to stop any of that.	Ntabwo tugomba guhagarika kimwe muri byo.
I wanted to go back to the room.	Nashakaga gusubira mu cyumba.
Like.	Nka.
I'm leaving now.	Ubu ngiye kuva hano.
He is a person with a plan.	Ni umuntu ufite gahunda.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
As long as we need to be.	Igihe cyose dukeneye kuba.
We had a son.	Twari dufite umuhungu.
Always, at all costs.	Buri gihe, kuri byose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
You include everyone.	Urimo abantu bose.
You are not very good.	Ntabwo uri mwiza cyane.
Good to see.	Nibyiza kubona.
What to do! 	Icyo gukora!
But there is a lot of shame.	Ariko hari isoni nyinshi.
They were outside.	Bari hanze.
You can do something there.	Urashobora kugira icyo ukora aho.
Apparently he was scared.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ubwoba.
She has to live with me.	Agomba kubana nanjye.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Absolutely.	Nukuri cyane.
He can be anything.	Ashobora kuba ikintu cyose.
Everything you need to know.	Ibyo ukeneye kumenya byose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I am a woman.	Ndi umugore.
I don’t have to carry my whole family.	Ntabwo ngomba gutwara umuryango wanjye wose.
I guess that's true.	Ndakeka ko ari ukuri.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
But most people are not.	Ariko abantu benshi sibyo.
One big, one small.	Kimwe kinini, gito.
And they were many.	Kandi bari benshi.
I should have heard.	Nari nkwiye kumva.
I saw a problem.	Nabonye ikibazo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
It’s a big purchase.	Ni kugura cyane.
Just a question.	Ikibazo gusa.
Obviously it's good.	Biragaragara ko ari byiza.
There is only one.	Hariho wenyine wenyine.
We needed.	Twari dukeneye.
That was your own fault, and yours too.	Ibyo byari amakosa yawe wenyine, kandi nawe.
It is always possible.	Buri gihe birashoboka.
She was so beautiful, so confident.	Yari mwiza cyane, yizeye cyane.
I knew everyone.	Nari nzi abantu bose.
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki.
But really.	Ariko rwose.
I was scared, that's right.	Nagize ubwoba, uko ni ukuri.
Well, soon.	Nibyiza, vuba aha.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It is up to him to do something.	Ni kuri we kugira icyo akora.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
It was a lot of things.	Byari ibintu byinshi.
He tried food.	Yagerageje ibiryo.
Walking is good.	Kugenda ni byiza.
He didn't look at anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yarebye.
But then he got scared.	Ariko nyuma yaje kugira ubwoba.
I hear a lot.	Ndumva byinshi.
And that's exactly what he did.	Kandi nibyo rwose yakoze.
There is something else here.	Hano hari ikindi kintu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo akazi.
It is not a book.	Ntabwo ari igitabo.
And later, learning opportunities.	Kandi nyuma, amahirwe yo kwiga.
No good time.	Nta gihe cyiza.
Doing the job.	Gukora akazi.
It was very home.	Byari murugo cyane.
Either way, it was great.	Ibyo ari byo byose, byari byiza.
Not good for me.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
Not until he does something small.	Ntabwo kugeza igihe azaba akora ikintu gito.
I want to stay in.	Ndashaka kuguma muri.
A good, beautiful book.	Igitabo cyiza, cyiza.
He really did.	Yabikoze rwose.
I like.	Nkunda.
In his time it was normal.	Mu gihe cye byari ibintu bisanzwe.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
She thought about her eating plan.	Yatekereje kuri gahunda ye yo kurya.
Everything was easy to do.	Ibintu byose byari byoroshye gukora.
At the time, he did not know what to expect.	Icyo gihe, ntabwo yari azi icyo agomba gutegereza.
Everyone needs the right opportunity.	Umuntu wese akeneye amahirwe akwiye.
The small thing, is, and.	Ikintu gito, ni, kandi.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
I didn’t know who he was or what he might be.	Sinari nzi uwo ari we cyangwa icyo ashobora kuba cyo.
I want to talk to you about it.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe kuri ibyo.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
That's not what he wanted to hear.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga kumva.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
I don't want to say much.	Sinshaka kuvuga byinshi.
I wanted to be here.	Nashakaga kuba hano.
But you have so much.	Ariko ufite byinshi cyane.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
I am the only one here.	Ninjye wenyine hano.
Under him, nothing.	Munsi ye, nta kintu na kimwe.
He was one.	Yari umwe.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
There is only one other thing to do.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe gusa cyo gukora.
But not before.	Ariko si mbere.
He didn't want anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga.
One day, but it's not.	Umunsi umwe, ariko sibyo.
I want more.	Ndashaka byinshi.
He wanted to go back.	Yashakaga gusubira inyuma.
Anyone can do it.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
To him and to him.	Kuri we no kuri we.
It was a bad day.	Wari umunsi mubi.
And it’s not just an opportunity.	Kandi ntabwo ari amahirwe gusa.
That was the day he said enough.	Uwo wari umunsi yavuze bihagije.
He is one of us.	Ni umwe muri twe.
You are watching a movie.	Urimo kureba firime.
The guy got the idea.	Umusore yabonye igitekerezo.
They were so many.	Bari benshi cyane.
But there is very little time to work.	Ariko hari igihe gito cyane cyo gukora.
I don't think so recently.	Ntabwo ntekereza vuba aha.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
You have to work every day.	Ugomba gukora buri munsi.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
I want to see something else.	Ndashaka kubona ikindi kintu.
Maybe soon.	Yaba ahari vuba.
You have to talk.	Ugomba kuvuga.
I hope that will be enough.	Ndizera ko ibyo bizaba bihagije.
Or maybe he was alone.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari we wenyine.
Obviously, however, this is not always the case.	Biragaragara, ariko, ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
He can look a little.	Ashobora kureba gato.
It's your house.	Ni inzu yawe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It should be low.	Agomba kuba hasi.
You are not sure how.	Ntabwo uzi neza uko.
And that was it at the time.	Kandi icyo gihe byari.
He says it's not something.	Avuga ko atari ikintu.
All of that was true.	Ibyo byose byari ukuri.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
Lots.	Byinshi.
If anything he was very good.	Niba hari ikintu yari mwiza cyane.
Please feel free to contact me.	Nyamuneka numvise ari byiza.
But, as usual, nothing came of it.	Ariko, nkuko bisanzwe, ntacyo yaje.
This is exactly what I do.	Ibi nibyo nkora nkanjye.
I can't talk to anyone.	Ntabwo nshobora kuvugana numuntu numwe.
You look bad.	Niwowe usa nabi.
It's true now.	Ni ukuri ubu.
The whole family was.	Umuryango wose wari.
No one ever did.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze akora.
This is a great thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza cyane.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
There is something for everyone.	Hariho ikintu kuri buri wese.
I wanted to do it for a long time.	Nashakaga kubikora igihe kirekire.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari afite.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
He is probably scared.	Birashoboka ko afite ubwoba.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
I always think of you.	Ndatekereza nawe buri gihe.
I never heard of anything.	Sinigeze numva ikintu.
He never did that.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora na gato.
She was so beautiful she didn't have to.	Yari mwiza cyane adafite.
They were far away.	Bari kure.
No one said.	Nta muntu wigeze avuga.
But here.	Ariko hano.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You have	Ufite.
But he feels bad about the problem.	Ariko yumva nabi ikibazo.
There is no going back now.	Nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
You were always young.	Buri gihe wari muto.
I know that.	Nzi ko aribyo.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
He told me that today.	Yambwiye ko uyu munsi.
But we can all make mistakes.	Ariko twese dushobora gukora amakosa.
You can't identify people.	Ntushobora kumenya abantu.
He just thought he looked.	Yatekerezaga gusa uko asa.
I felt scared.	Numvise mfite ubwoba.
I feel the same way.	Ndumva ari kimwe.
Everyone wanted to do something.	Umuntu wese yashakaga gukora ikintu.
However, this is not the case here.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
He chose to play near me.	Yahisemo gukina hafi yanjye.
I do not believe.	Ntabwo nizera.
He has been around for a long time.	Amaze igihe kinini.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
Her hair is really beautiful.	Umusatsi we rwose ni mwiza.
No one is in the room.	Nta muntu uri mu cyumba.
I love everything.	Nkunda ikintu cyose.
I thought it was easy to read.	Natekereje ko byoroshye gusoma.
It was true.	Yari ukuri.
That you are.	Ko ari wowe.
She is worried about him.	Afite impungenge kuri we.
It will be good for me.	Bizaba byiza kuri njye.
But we are here together.	Ariko turi hano hamwe.
Especially since he was very young.	Cyane ko yari akiri muto cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
But now we were too many.	Ariko ubu twari turi benshi cyane.
It's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
He didn't have time to do it.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo kubikora.
He didn't expect to see anything.	Ntabwo yari yiteze kubona ikintu.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
You have to be an expert.	Ugomba kuba umuhanga.
It's good for your time.	Nibyiza umwanya wawe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You have a job.	Ufite akazi.
Everyone really wants to be with you.	Umuntu wese arashaka kubana nawe mubyukuri.
This is a request.	Ubu ni gusaba.
This will not be true.	Ibi ntabwo bizaba ari ukuri.
It wasn’t much to learn.	Ntabwo byari byinshi byo kwiga.
I don't have to know all this.	Ntabwo ngomba kumenya ibi byose.
No problem at all.	Nta kibazo na gito.
He thought he looked.	Yatekereje uko asa.
If he is a boy.	Niba ari umuhungu.
I don’t want to stop being that person.	Sinshaka kureka kuba uwo muntu.
This one went well.	Uyu yagiye neza.
That's what they were.	Nibyo bari.
We need help with everything.	Dukeneye ubufasha muri byose.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
We have everything you need here.	Dufite ibyo ukeneye byose hano.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
We were close.	Twari hafi.
This program.	Iyi gahunda.
If he is, he is.	Niba ari we, ni we.
It was for me, very good things.	Byari kuri njye, ibintu byiza cyane.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ugomba kumenya icyo aricyo cyose.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
That's a really good thing.	Icyo ni ikintu cyiza rwose.
You are not sure how.	Ntabwo uzi neza uko.
It seemed good.	Yasaga naho ari byiza.
Maybe very little.	Ahari gato cyane.
I don't know much about him.	Ntabwo nzi byinshi kuri we.
It's not close.	Ntabwo ari hafi.
We all need to go far.	Twese dukeneye kujya kure.
There are his clothes.	Hariho imyenda ye.
No need to think about that.	Nta mpamvu yo gutekereza kuri ibyo.
She is young and very beautiful.	Ari muto kandi mwiza cyane.
This is daily.	Uyu ni buri munsi.
The problem is mistakes.	Ikibazo ni amakosa.
We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
He should always say this.	Buri gihe agomba kuvuga ibi.
You are always there.	Buri gihe uri.
But it is not far behind.	Ariko ntabwo iri inyuma.
I mean, it may not be the way it used to be.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ashobora kuba atari uko yahoze.
Maybe just fear.	Ahari ubwoba gusa.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
Worse than that.	Mubyukuri mubi kuruta ibyo.
It was better to be alone.	Byari byiza kuba wenyine.
I had nothing to say.	Ntacyo nari mfite cyo kubwira.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He didn't want to swim.	Ntiyashakaga koga.
Really a lot of people.	Nukuri mubyukuri abantu benshi.
You want to know what to do.	Ushaka kumenya icyo gukora.
You have something to do.	Ufite icyo ugomba gukora.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
She said she could not wait to take the baby.	Yavuze ko adashobora gutegereza gufata umwana muto.
You may have the same problem.	Urashobora kugira ikibazo kimwe.
Once, only once.	Rimwe, rimwe gusa.
No one thought of doing it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze atekereza kubikora.
He was the only one.	Yari umwe wenyine.
He needed to talk to someone.	Yari akeneye kuvugana n'umuntu.
The family must come.	Umuryango ugomba kuza.
Or maybe it's not.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari byo.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
I was afraid to speak.	Nagize ubwoba bwo kuvuga.
I need an idea here.	Nkeneye igitekerezo hano.
He did not come in one day.	Ntabwo yaje mu munsi umwe.
As usual.	Nkuko bisanzwe.
But to see anything else.	Ariko kubona ikindi kintu cyose.
Very young man.	Umusore cyane.
I mean, you can, but you don't have to.	Ndashaka kuvuga, urashobora, ariko ntugomba.
You are an expert.	Uri umuhanga.
There is a car here.	Hano hari imodoka.
I was not sure what.	Sinari nzi neza icyo.
That's all he needs to know.	Ibyo aribyo byose agomba kumenya.
I think he is the right person for the job.	Ntekereza ko ari umuntu ukwiye akazi.
I don't know that.	Sinzi ibyo.
In fact, you have to go now.	Mubyukuri, ugomba kugenda nonaha.
She saw the baby as a girl.	Yabonye umwana ari umukobwa.
It was good to go.	Byari byiza kugenda.
Not very good, that.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane, ibyo.
You are looking for an expert.	Urimo gushaka umuhanga.
I have no plans.	Nta gahunda mfite.
Well, at least they didn't go down without explaining themselves first.	Nibyiza kandi, bari.
He saw that fear.	Yabonye ko ubwoba.
She is a beautiful woman, she is.	Ni umugore mwiza, ni.
He is here with you.	Ari hano hamwe nawe.
Obviously it is possible.	Biragaragara ko birashoboka.
It is clear that he is not.	Biragaragara ariko ko atari we.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
He would not go.	Ntiyari kugenda.
I'm glad he's here.	Nishimiye ko ari hano.
Nothing for me.	Nta na kimwe kuri njye.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu ibyo byaba.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
This is a difficult task to overcome.	Ibi ni ibintu bigoye gutsinda.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
He seemed to be alone.	Yasaga naho ari wenyine.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
And this.	Kandi iki.
It would not work well.	Ntabwo byari gukora neza.
I saw it now.	Nabonye ubu.
And a lot of food.	Kandi ibiryo byinshi.
To this day, no one was.	Kuri uyu munsi, nta wari.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
Maybe he wants to talk.	Ahari arashaka kuvuga.
This is really good.	Ibi ni byiza rwose.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
The money had gone.	Amafaranga yari yagiye.
I have to get out of here.	Ngomba kuva hano.
And he is scared.	Kandi afite ubwoba.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hari umwanya.
This is his fault.	Iri ni amakosa ye.
He had to walk alone.	Yagombaga kugenda wenyine.
We were just worried.	Twari dufite impungenge gusa.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
You can really swim.	Urashobora koga rwose.
Well everyone on the ground.	Neza abantu bose hasi.
Today was not the day.	Uyu munsi ntabwo wari uwo munsi.
He also knew the truth.	Yari azi kandi ukuri.
He could have been there.	Yashoboraga kuba ahari.
He could not be human.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kuba umuntu.
In any case, he had nothing to say.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta cyo yari afite cyo kuvuga.
In fact, it is very good.	Mubyukuri, ni byiza cyane.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
Only.	Gusa.
Only then.	Gusa icyo gihe.
it worked out.	byagenze neza.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I was a boy once.	Nari umuhungu rimwe.
He can be a good person.	Ashobora kuba umuntu mwiza.
They were not here or here.	Ntabwo bari hano cyangwa hano.
He went down.	Yagiye hasi.
But he was human.	Ariko yari umuntu.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
Just a guy.	Umusore gusa.
He feels good.	Yumva neza.
He did not want her to leave.	Ntiyashakaga ko agenda.
He did not know if he was right or not.	Ntiyari azi niba afite ukuri cyangwa atari byo.
They had nothing for me.	Ntacyo bari bafite kuri njye.
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
She knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko ari mwiza.
You want something for me.	Urashaka ikintu kuri njye.
There is his family.	Hariho umuryango we.
It's too bad, too bad.	Ni mubi, cyane, mubi cyane.
Most people in a very short time.	Abantu benshi mugihe gito cyane.
Obviously he doesn’t have to drive.	Biragaragara ko atagomba gutwara imodoka.
I can do a lot of good things.	Nshobora gukora byinshi byiza.
This is her youngest son.	Uyu ni umuhungu we muto.
If not today, tomorrow.	Niba atari uyu munsi, ni ejo.
I can have.	Nshobora kugira.
Mine.	Yanjye.
He didn't need to.	Ntiyari akeneye.
That’s a great idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo kinini.
Everything was easy to live with.	Ibintu byose byari byoroshye kubana.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
But that was enough.	Ariko byari bihagije.
He knew the plan.	Yari azi gahunda.
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
The reasons are many.	Impamvu ni nyinshi.
He must be one.	Agomba kuba umwe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari.
We have it all.	Dufite byose.
You have to talk.	Ugomba kuvugana.
You were so beautiful tonight.	Wari mwiza cyane muri iri joro.
You are a boy or a girl.	Uri umuhungu cyangwa umukobwa.
What he always wants.	Icyo ahora ashaka.
He didn't need to.	Ntiyari akeneye.
It will be tonight.	Bizaba no muri iri joro.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi.
He knows people well.	Azi abantu neza.
He could hear nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kumva.
It’s not just an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa.
One has to be.	Umuntu agomba kuba.
The one he could wait for.	Uwo yashoboraga gutegereza.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I really like this one.	Nkunda cyane iyi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza rwose amafaranga ashobora kugura.
From then on, we can take things first.	Kuva icyo gihe, dushobora gufata ibintu imbere.
None of that here.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo hano.
I'm just glad he has faith.	Nishimiye gusa ko afite kwizera.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
He must be who he is.	Agomba kuba uwo ari we.
They were all around me.	Bose bari hafi yanjye.
But that is me.	Ariko ibyo ni njye.
We can't believe anything here.	Ntidushobora kwizera ikintu na kimwe hano.
He had.	Yari afite.
You are worried this week.	Ufite impungenge kuri iki cyumweru.
You know nothing.	Ntacyo uzi.
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
The car is gone.	Imodoka yagiye.
This was my favorite moment.	Uyu wari umwanya nkunda cyane.
Maybe a little.	Ahari gato.
That's it.	Ndi uko.
I do not mean.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
He was probably his father.	Birashoboka ko yari se.
It seems like a lot, every week.	Birasa nkaho ari byinshi, buri cyumweru.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
That, too, was normal.	Ibyo na byo byari bisanzwe.
This person is alone.	Uyu muntu ari wenyine.
That you can see.	Ko ushobora kubona.
He is not a human being, in fact.	Ntabwo ari umuntu uwo ari we wese, mubyukuri.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
He would not have had in her.	Ntabwo yari kuba afite muri we.
But a good question.	Ariko ikibazo cyiza.
Everyone is alone.	Umuntu wese ari wenyine.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, nibyiza kongera kubana nawe.
It was a great time.	Wari umwanya mwiza.
He had.	Yari afite.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
And he was probably right.	Kandi birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
There is a girl.	Hariho umukobwa.
So far, nothing.	Kugeza ubu, ntacyo.
Doing well.	Gukora neza.
I also wanted to be something.	Nashakaga no kuba ikintu.
I need to know the car.	Ngomba kumenya imodoka.
He said something very nice.	Yavuze ikintu cyiza cyane.
He didn't even want to talk to her.	Ntiyashakaga no kuvugana na we.
She used to be alone.	Yakundaga kuba wenyine.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
Girl or not.	Umukobwa cyangwa ntabwo.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
We are not inside.	Ntabwo turi imbere.
I didn’t like it very much, in fact.	Sinigeze nkunda cyane, mubyukuri.
One walks alone.	Umwe agenda wenyine.
In fact, he thinks he was lucky.	Mubyukuri, atekereza ko yagize amahirwe menshi.
They are not human beings.	Ntabwo ari abantu.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
There is very little time to do something.	Hariho umwanya muto cyane wo gukora ikintu.
He had left in the morning.	Mu gitondo yari yagiye.
At the time, he could not walk.	Muri icyo gihe, ntabwo yashoboraga kugenda.
This one had a lot.	Uyu yari afite byinshi.
That's really cool.	Ibyo ni byiza rwose.
The girl is not what she looks like.	Umukobwa ntabwo aribyo asa.
I think everyone has mistakes today.	Ntekereza ko buri wese afite amakosa muri iki gihe.
This worked out well in a short time.	Ibi byagenze neza mugihe gito.
I don't think much.	Ntabwo ntekereza cyane.
We are truly a family.	Turi umuryango rwose.
But is it possible?	Ariko birashoboka?
The phone went off.	Terefone yagiye.
He alone can never be.	We wenyine ntashobora kuba na rimwe.
I know how to play.	Nzi gukina.
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
No one alone.	Nta n'umwe wenyine.
Most of them are opportunities.	Byinshi muri byo ni amahirwe.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
So far so good,.	Kugeza ubu ni byiza cyane,.
Good friends	Inshuti nziza.
You have to do something else.	Ugomba gukora ikindi kintu.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
You have to overcome that.	Ugomba gutsinda ibyo.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
None of us said much.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wigeze avuga byinshi.
You were at work.	Wari ku kazi.
She feels good.	Yumva ari byiza.
I do not understand.	Ntabwo numva.
He had a reason.	Yari afite impamvu.
You are doing a lot.	Urimo ukora byinshi.
he said.	yavuze.
And he has.	Kandi afite.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
But we are not all in this together.	Ariko ntabwo twese turi muri ibi hamwe.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He did not come.	Ntabwo yaje.
He can't even be there.	Ntashobora no kuba ahari.
He was not alone.	Ntiyari wenyine.
You can see that it worked out well for me.	Urashobora kubona byagenze neza kuri njye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko umuhungu yari yatangiye kugenda.
That's the way it is.	Uri uko ushobora kuba.
Obviously a lot of things.	Biragaragara ko ibintu byinshi.
Going well.	Kugenda neza.
It would not be good for a dog.	Ntabwo byaba byiza imbwa.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
He may be telling the truth.	Ashobora kuba avuga ukuri.
He knew exactly what to do.	Yari azi neza icyo gukora.
He didn't want to hear.	Ntiyashakaga kumva.
He has to know, he has to know.	Agomba kumenya neza, agomba rwose.
No movies.	Nta firime.
But not all.	Ariko si bose.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
No one was inside.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uri imbere.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
He must know what it is.	Agomba kumenya icyo aricyo.
They were both upstairs.	Bombi bari hejuru.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko atari ukuri.
And it is.	Kandi ni.
He got it enough.	Yabonye bihagije.
And it wouldn't have happened here.	Kandi ntabwo byari kubaho hano.
I thought so.	Natekereje gutya.
I have a good dog.	Mfite imbwa nziza.
That's great for us.	Ibyo ni byiza cyane kuri twe.
I have my time.	Mfite umwanya wanjye.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko byari byiza.
Good teacher.	Umwarimu mwiza.
But we can't.	Ariko ntidushobora.
And that is what he wants for all of us.	Kandi nibyo ashaka kuri twese.
It's up to me.	Ni kuri njye.
Wherever he wants.	Aho ashaka.
But it's all your fault.	Ariko byose ni amakosa yawe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I should get a dog.	Nkwiye kubona imbwa.
They were many.	Bari benshi.
I don’t know how he got the truth.	Ntazi uburyo afite ukuri.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
I know enough to do it.	Nzi bihagije kubikora.
His father was not right about everything.	Se ntiyari afite ukuri kuri byose.
I am at the moment.	Ndi kuri ubu.
No one is smart.	Nta muntu ufite ubwenge.
He was probably scared.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ubwoba.
He did not know why he had come.	Ntiyari azi impamvu yaje aho ari.
He was not alone in prison.	Ntabwo yari wenyine muri gereza.
I'm going to do it.	Ngiye kubikora.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose byari byiza.
It was as if he was worried or something.	Byari nkaho yari afite impungenge cyangwa ikindi kintu.
It was great too.	Byari byiza kandi.
But you have to find the truth.	Ariko ugomba kubona ukuri.
It wouldn't go away.	Ntabwo byari kugenda.
Where he may be alone.	Aho ashobora kuba wenyine.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
Outside.	Hanze.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
I don't tell anyone.	Nta muntu n'umwe mbwira.
He was very skilled and prepared.	Yari umuhanga cyane kandi yiteguye.
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
At the time, it was easy.	Icyo gihe byari byoroshye.
I want to get things right.	Ndashaka kubona ibintu neza.
But he was not alone.	Ariko ntiyari we wenyine.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
And maybe sometimes it is.	Kandi birashoboka ko rimwe na rimwe ari.
She loves this house.	Akunda iyi nzu.
I was a young man.	Nari umusore muto.
This is all.	Ibi ni byose.
I have a son at school here.	Mfite umuhungu ku ishuri hano.
But we can't wait any longer.	Ariko ntidushobora gutegereza ikindi gihe.
That was the guy you needed.	Ibyo byari umusore wari ukeneye.
All in all, it's great, it's great.	Byose, nibyiza, nibyiza cyane.
He knew how to play.	Yari azi gukina.
Knowledge and learning.	Kumenya no kwiga.
I like to play.	Nkunda gukina.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
Only for him.	Kuri we gusa.
Yes, you can.	Nibyo, urashobora kubona.
A lot of people are scared.	Abantu benshi bafite ubwoba.
He had a good reason to look.	Yari afite impamvu yo kureba neza.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
I need to understand why he did what he did.	Nkeneye kumva impamvu yakoze ibyo yakoze.
This is probably my fault.	Ibi birashoboka ko ari amakosa yanjye.
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
He saw things.	Yabonye ibintu.
Learning.	Kwiga.
And here.	Kandi hano.
Not always good.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari byiza.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
Today, we can do much good.	Muri iki gihe, dushobora gukora byinshi byiza.
We are all in this world for a while.	Twese turi kuri iyi si igihe gito.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
They know how to play.	Bazi gukina.
He went down.	Yagiye hasi.
I had none in me.	Ntabwo nari mfite muri njye.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Apparently that worked out well.	Biragaragara ko ibyo byagenze neza.
But not many.	Ariko si benshi cyane.
But it’s a great thing to have.	Ariko ni ibintu byiza cyane kugira.
Sometimes, he could see that.	Rimwe na rimwe, yashoboraga kubona ibyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I have a better plan than that.	Mfite gahunda nziza kurenza iyo.
Everyone has their own preferences.	Umuntu wese afite ibyo akunda.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
We have no job.	Ntabwo dufite akazi.
That's all you need to know.	Ibyo aribyo byose ugomba kumenya.
There is only this.	Hariho ibi gusa.
Absolutely.	Hariho rwose.
He heard something.	Yumvise ikintu.
I need to know where they are.	Nkeneye kumenya aho bari.
I can't figure out what that is.	Sinshobora kumenya icyo.
You never worked here.	Ntabwo wigeze ukora hano.
Another time.	Ikindi gihe.
Everyone says things they never said.	Umuntu wese avuga ibintu atigeze avuga buri gihe.
We have a house, but we are not a house.	Dufite inzu, ariko ntabwo turi inzu.
Everything was easy.	Byose byari byoroshye.
I don't see it close enough.	Ntabwo mbona hafi bihagije.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
The boy was not bad at all.	Umuhungu ntabwo yari mubi rwose.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He was very outside.	Yari hanze cyane.
He is very professional.	Ni umuhanga cyane.
And he never did.	Kandi ntiyigeze abikora.
He always tried to do something good.	Yagerageje buri gihe gukora ikintu cyiza.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu kibi na gito.
Only.	Gusa.
That's a long time.	Icyo ni igihe kinini.
If not, it is a bad thing.	Niba atari byo, ni ikintu kibi.
No one would know who we are.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kumenya ko ari twe.
He saw people behind him.	Yabonye abantu inyuma ye.
For me, it was good.	Kuri njye, byari byiza.
We have to do it now.	Tugomba kubikora ubu.
It's too early.	Ni kare cyane.
And not just me, everyone.	Kandi ntabwo ari njye gusa, abantu bose.
He had no phone.	Nta terefone yari afite.
That's a lot of food.	Ibyo ni ibiryo byinshi.
But, you have to do everything simple.	Ariko, ugomba gukora ibintu byose byoroshye.
You must be bad, he thought of the boy.	Ugomba kuba mubi, yatekereje umuhungu.
And you think about doing it.	Kandi utekereza kubikora.
We are just.	Turi gusa.
No one is behind him.	Nta muntu uri inyuma ye.
If it were a good gift.	Iyo yaba impano nziza.
I don't want to live like that.	Sinshaka kubaho gutya.
It was all he could think of doing.	Byari byose yashoboraga gutekereza gukora.
He thought so too.	Na we yatekereje.
You can tell me now.	Urashobora kumbwira nonaha.
They’re not human, that’s for sure.	Ntabwo ari abantu, nibyo rwose.
Money, very likely.	Amafaranga, birashoboka cyane.
.	.
You don't know how lucky you are !.	Ntabwo uzi uburyo ufite amahirwe!.
He got it all.	Yabonye byose.
For everything they would do.	Kubyo bari gukora byose.
But he had no phone.	Ariko nta terefone yari afite.
Good to see.	Nibyiza kubona.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
You did it yourself.	Wabikoze wenyine.
I can't wait to do this again.	Sinshobora gutegereza kongera gukora ibi.
We are all.	Twese turi.
Is this something? 	Iki ni ikintu?
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
We were far behind.	Twari inyuma cyane.
He didn't like it but it was great.	Ntabwo akunda ariko byari byiza cyane.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
You can't give up fast.	Ntushobora kureka vuba.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Yashoboraga gukora icyo ashaka cyose.
He was one of me.	Yari umwe muri njye.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Age well.	Imyaka neza.
She is most likely to be his wife.	Birashoboka cyane ko yaba umugore we.
He may have thought he was right.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje ko afite ukuri.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza cyane, birashoboka ko atari byo.
He loved planning.	Yakundaga gahunda.
We need everyone.	Dukeneye abantu bose.
You can see nothing.	Ntacyo ushobora kubona.
Maybe he should be scared.	Birashoboka ko agomba kugira ubwoba.
A girl like her.	Umukobwa nka we.
He had one son.	Yari afite umuhungu umwe.
No one is close to winning.	Nta n'umwe uri hafi gutsinda.
Now he has to wait.	Ubu agomba gutegereza.
Well done.	Neza neza.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga.
I haven't heard from him since.	Kuva icyo gihe sinigeze numva.
He needs to do better.	Akeneye gukora neza.
But there are many reasons.	Ariko hariho impamvu nyinshi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He thought about it a lot.	Yatekereje kuri byinshi.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi.
It's true for me.	Ni ukuri kuri njye.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Today.	Uyu munsi.
It was close to him.	Byari hafi kuri we.
We are especially.	Turi cyane cyane.
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
He is not doing well.	Ntabwo akora neza.
It’s money, money, money.	Ni amafaranga, amafaranga, amafaranga.
They were many.	Bari benshi.
But there is a lot to learn now.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo kwiga ubu.
He loved cars.	Yakundaga imodoka.
He may be.	Ashobora no kuba.
This time it is clear that it is not.	Iki gihe biragaragara ko atari byo.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
Obviously I don’t want to do this.	Biragaragara ko ntashaka gukora ibi.
Great to read.	Kinini cyo gusoma.
But it is also outside.	Ariko kandi ni hanze.
I only work here.	Nkora hano gusa.
Sometimes, a lot.	Rimwe na rimwe, byinshi.
And she was just a girl.	Kandi yari umukobwa gusa.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
.	.
He is playing with you.	Arimo gukina nawe.
I was beautiful.	Nari mwiza.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Please, eat and drink.	Nyamuneka, kurya no kunywa.
That would be a problem.	Byaba ikibazo.
There is all the food to eat.	Hariho ibiryo byose byo kurya.
He would definitely do it.	Rwose yari kubikora.
He always did.	Buri gihe yabikoze.
We had no one.	Nta muntu n'umwe twari dufite.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
And that.	Kandi ibyo.
There is something else to look at.	Hariho ikindi kintu cyo kureba.
Maybe we need to try something else.	Ahari dukeneye kugerageza ikindi.
You are scared.	Ufite ubwoba.
He thought he would do it.	Yatekereje ko azabikora.
I'm not going to go into everything.	Ntabwo ngiye kujya muri byose.
I had a catch job.	Nari mfite akazi ko gufata.
But he.	Ariko we.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
This is a gift.	Iyi ni impano.
You can't understand why.	Ntushobora kumva impamvu.
I love it for a long time.	Nkunda igihe kirekire.
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
He was a good player.	Yari umukinnyi mwiza.
He looked at her, not knowing what to say.	Yarebye atazi icyo avuga.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
She knew in that look that he had arrived in her room.	Yari azi ko, ubu, hano mu cyumba cye.
Tomorrow is nothing.	Ejo ntacyo.
You can learn a lot.	Urashobora kwiga byinshi.
Like his father.	Kimwe na se.
I'm really worried.	Mfite impungenge rwose.
I didn’t have to drive together.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gutwara hamwe.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
He always looks good.	Buri gihe asa neza.
Very bad idea.	Igitekerezo kibi cyane.
He was absolutely scared.	Yari afite ubwoba rwose.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
But taking more.	Ariko gufata byinshi.
He left as soon as he arrived.	Yagiye vuba nkuko yaje.
He always has.	Buri gihe afite.
You know my family.	Uzi umuryango wanjye.
I did the same thing today.	Uyu munsi nakoze ikintu kimwe.
Everything was great.	Byose byari byiza cyane.
What you have.	Ibyo ufite.
She has a child and she is her child.	Afite umwana kandi ni umwana we.
I'm not good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza.
I was not a good woman.	Ntabwo nari umugore mwiza.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
He needed more, more.	Yari akeneye byinshi, cyane.
He has found work to date.	Yabonye gukora kugeza ubu.
He is ready.	Yiteguye.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
This is exactly what he did.	Uyu ni we rwose.
This is really good.	Ibi rwose ni byiza.
How can he be with her?	Nigute ashobora kubana na we?.
It's not about him, it's about him.	Ntabwo ari kuri yo, muri yo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
Here, we have time.	Hano, dufite umwanya.
He can read to anyone.	Arashobora gusoma umuntu uwo ari we wese.
You never know when.	Ntushobora kumenya neza igihe.
I saw something.	Nabonye ikintu.
Today, things are much better.	Uyu munsi, ibintu ni byiza cyane.
That's not an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
No job.	Nta kazi.
Today, he did not come to school.	Uyu munsi, ntabwo yaje ku ishuri.
And, they had plans.	Kandi, bari bafite gahunda.
It's not too early.	Ntabwo ari kare cyane.
Long time no see	Igihe kirekire.
I thought.	Natekereje.
But you can't win.	Ariko ntushobora gutsinda.
It was good to live.	Byari byiza kubaho.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
You are beautiful !.	Uri mwiza!.
I am a young child.	Ndi umwana muto.
This is what I want.	Ibi nibyo nshaka.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
Everything he does.	Ibyo akora byose.
Especially one as good as him.	Cyane cyane kimwe cyiza nka we.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, byose ni ukuri ubu.
Here.	Hano.
He was a very good child.	Yari umwana mwiza cyane.
I don't want to go home with you.	Ntashaka gutaha nanjye.
Apparently he tried to help.	Biragaragara ko yagerageje gufasha.
You are just scared.	Ufite ubwoba gusa.
I can't play a guy.	Sinshobora gukina umusore.
My mistakes were many.	Amakosa yanjye yari menshi.
Waiting to hear.	Gutegereza kumva.
He is alone.	We wenyine.
He loved to watch.	Yakundaga kureba.
But not today.	Ariko si uyu munsi.
No one should do that.	Nta muntu n'umwe ugomba kubikora.
And he was beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
I enjoy working.	Nishimiye gukora akazi.
He thought that was good.	Yatekereje ko ibyo ari byiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
We have to have time.	Tugomba kugira umwanya.
I want people behind me.	Ndashaka abantu inyuma yanjye.
Or, you don’t have to.	Cyangwa, ntabwo ugomba.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu ni byiza ariko.
He knew he had to do something.	Yari azi ko agomba kugira icyo akora.
We were here this morning.	Twari hano muri iki gitondo.
But this was good.	Ariko ibi byari byiza.
I think a lot.	Ndatekereza cyane.
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
There is no behind him.	Nta inyuma ye.
He knew nothing.	Nta cyo yari azi.
I think every day.	Ntekereza buri munsi.
This is not easy.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
Absolutely.	Ari rwose.
Apparently it was a lot for him.	Biragaragara ko byari byinshi kuri we.
It is also possible and easy to carry.	Birashoboka kandi byoroshye kandi byoroshye gutwara.
He had nothing for him.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite kuri we.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
No job at all.	Nta kazi ni gato.
And there is a problem.	Kandi hariho ikibazo.
I had a very long time ahead of me.	Nari mfite igihe kirekire cyane imbere yanjye.
He said what he meant.	Yavuze icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
I didn't want to touch anything.	Sinifuzaga gukora ku kintu na kimwe.
He probably had high expectations.	Birashoboka ko yari yiteze byinshi.
We don't need it.	Ntabwo dukeneye.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
Everything was easy.	Byose byari byoroshye.
He will never speak.	Ntazigera avuga.
No one, however, has the truth about everything.	Nta muntu, ariko, ufite ukuri kuri byose.
He thought it was possible.	Yatekereje ko bishoboka.
You are now my wife.	Ubu uri umugore wanjye.
That seems to be the case.	Ibyo birasa nkaho.
This is definitely a good thing.	Ibi rwose ni ibintu byiza.
I'm not good at all.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza na gato.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He knew the problem.	Yari azi ikibazo.
You can tell.	Urashobora kuvuga.
'	'
I don't like it at all.	Ntabwo nkunda na gato.
'	'
I would watch.	Nari kureba.
Eventually, he came alone.	Amaherezo, yaje wenyine.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
It is always his fault.	Buri gihe ni amakosa ye.
There are people.	Aho hari abantu.
I could be worse.	Nshobora kuba mubi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I feel the kids in the back.	Ndumva abana inyuma.
The day is near.	Umunsi uri hafi.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda na gato.
I'm terrified.	Mfite ubwoba bwo hejuru.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I am a child.	Ndi umwana.
I think that would be a good idea.	Ntekereza ko byaba ari igitekerezo cyiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
That was it, so far.	Ibyo byari, kugeza ubu.
He is not talking too much.	Ntabwo ari kuvuga cyane.
He looked very young.	Yasaga naho akiri muto cyane.
He says he does.	Avuga ko abikora.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
You have to figure out how.	Ni wowe ugomba kumenya uburyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I thought of going back.	Natekereje gusubira inyuma.
I saw a girl, here.	Nabonye umukobwa, hano.
He found someone.	Yabonye umuntu.
He has.	Afite.
He needs to see where he is.	Akeneye kureba aho ari.
I am far away.	Ndi kure yanjye.
These are people.	Aba ni abantu.
I have a little doubt about that.	Ndashidikanya gato kuri ibyo.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
Just drink.	Kunywa gusa.
He was not wearing anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yambaye.
You have to work really hard.	Ugomba gukora mubyukuri.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I did not know this.	Ntabwo nari nzi ibi.
I can't see well.	Sinshobora kubona neza.
You can't live together all the time.	Ntushobora kubana igihe cyose.
I'm upstairs.	Ndi hejuru.
That's not the problem.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
The truth is good.	Ukuri ni byiza.
Probably not at all.	Birashoboka ko atari rimwe na rimwe.
The food was also good.	Ibiryo na byo byari byiza.
I think he is a good player.	Ntekereza ko ari umukinnyi mwiza.
And not once.	Kandi si rimwe.
It wasn’t much, but for me it was an opportunity.	Ntabwo byari byinshi, ariko kuri njye byari amahirwe.
He is not a man in the forefront.	Ntabwo ari umuntu uri imbere.
But if that's the case then you can do it.	Ariko niba aribyo byose ushobora gukora.
That would be great.	Ibyo byaba ari ibintu byiza cyane.
But in the short term.	Ariko mu gihe gito.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
I have to know what he means.	Ngomba kumenya icyo ashaka kuvuga.
He did something.	Yagize icyo akora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I really enjoy the job.	Nishimiye cyane akazi.
He wanted to say everything about me.	Yashakaga kuvuga byose kuri njye.
Your house is outside.	Inzu yawe iri hanze.
That is the problem.	Ibyo ni ikibazo.
.	.
I was in his house.	Nari mu nzu ye.
Maybe you can help.	Ahari ushobora gufasha.
It's good to be back.	Nibyiza gusubira.
It was my fault.	Nari amakosa yanjye.
It has not always been easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byari byoroshye.
Everyone has a back.	Umuntu wese afite inyuma.
I need to see, to think.	Nkeneye kubona, gutekereza.
I don't want to play again today.	Sinshaka kongera gukina uyu munsi.
I feel he is still here.	Ndumva akiri hano.
So far it has been.	Kugeza ubu byari.
I can't drive.	Sinshobora gutwara.
He makes mistakes.	Akora amakosa.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
He knew what a house was.	Yari azi inzu iyo ari yo.
But he is the only child.	Ariko ni umwana wenyine.
I didn't want to know anything.	Sinifuzaga kumenya ikintu na kimwe.
One person, please.	Umuntu umwe, nyamuneka.
He wants to.	Ashaka ko.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
Just hearing.	Kumva gusa.
If you want to work you can come here.	Niba ushaka gukora urashobora kuza hano.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
You were right.	Wari ufite ukuri.
He tried to leave.	Yagerageje kugenda.
He did not look at the car.	Ntabwo yarebye imodoka.
He speaks a lot.	Avuga cyane.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
I may have problems.	Nshobora kugira ibibazo.
That's right.	Nukuri.
This is all you know.	Ibi nibyo uzi byose.
Really, really.	Nukuri, nukuri.
The girl never heard.	Umukobwa atigeze yumva.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo yari.
He doesn't really have to work.	Ntabwo rwose agomba gukora.
In fact, the food is very good.	Mubyukuri, ibiryo ni byiza cyane.
I hope they would say the same about me.	Nizera ko bari kuvuga kimwe kuri njye.
You did it.	Wabikoze.
He can be a lot.	Ashobora kuba byinshi.
That is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibintu.
I was not sure what to do or think.	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora cyangwa gutekereza.
It was enough that he did it.	Byari bihagije ko abikora.
Either way, you can do it.	Ibyo ari byo byose, urashobora kubikora.
You know what you're up to.	Uzi ibyo urimo.
I'm not.	Ntabwo ndimo.
She wanted to be with him.	Yashakaga kubana na we.
Maybe he could have done something else here.	Birashoboka ko yashoboraga gukora ikindi kintu hano.
It was good for him to do that.	Byari byiza kuri we gukora n'ibyo.
We don't have to go far.	Ntabwo tugomba kujya kure.
You really have to read everything here.	Ugomba rwose gusoma ibintu byose hano.
I thought, maybe.	Natekereje, birashoboka.
He had nothing to say.	Nta cyo yari yavuze.
I never wanted a baby.	Sinigeze nshaka umwana.
He was just a child.	Yari umwana gusa.
He was in the house.	Yari mu nzu.
He really is.	Arimo rwose.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
But for me it is a mistake.	Ariko kuri njye mbona ari amakosa.
You have to be an expert.	Ugomba kuba umuhanga.
He could see that it was possible.	Yashoboraga kubona ko bishoboka.
It is now.	Ubu ni.
It is not possible.	Ntabwo bishoboka ko bishoboka.
We need to get things simple.	Tugomba kubona ibintu byoroshye.
We don't need to talk.	Ntabwo dukeneye kuvuga.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
He never told the truth.	Ntiyigeze avuga ukuri.
Can you believe it? 	Urashobora kwizera?
You have to come.	Ufite kuza.
Staying out is not very good.	Kuguma hanze ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It's his turn.	Ni umwanya we.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bari gukora igihe kirekire bihagije.
And he told me everything.	Kandi yambwiye byose.
It worked really well.	Byagenze neza rwose.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
He had seen nothing.	Nta kintu yari yabonye.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
He was not good now.	Ntabwo yari mwiza ubu.
She feels scared.	Yumva ubwoba.
I have a problem.	Mfite ikibazo.
This is a great time to do it.	Iki ni igihe cyiza cyo kubikora.
He knew what to expect.	Yari azi icyo yizeye kubona.
But tonight it wouldn’t work.	Ariko iri joro ntabwo byari gukora.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
And good father.	Na se mwiza.
He saw but a dog.	Yabonye ariko imbwa.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
I think he is one.	Ntekereza ko ari umwe.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
And not everyone.	Kandi si umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I really like to talk.	Mubyukuri nkunda kuvuga.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
If nothing good.	Niba nta cyiza cyiza.
It was just a matter of time.	Gusa byari ibintu.
Or almost did.	Cyangwa hafi yabikoze.
I'm going to leave.	Ngiye kugenda.
But there is only one.	Ariko hariho umwe wenyine.
He had a lot of plans.	Yari afite gahunda nyinshi.
All of that.	Ibyo byose.
He had done nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yakoze.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
I don't think so.	Ntekereza ko atari byo.
If we.	Niba twe.
He seemed incapable of thinking.	Yasaga naho adashobora gutekereza.
He thought about how things worked out.	Yatekereje uburyo ibintu byagenze neza.
But he was not.	Ariko na we ntiyari.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
You have to tell me everything.	Ugomba kumbwira byose.
Please let me go.	Nyamuneka reka reka.
He was actually a friend and knew how to speak well.	Mubyukuri yari inshuti kandi azi kuvuga neza.
Everyone had their own plan.	Buri wese yari afite gahunda ye.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
But you really want to do something.	Ariko mubyukuri urashaka gukora ikintu.
That's exactly what I like.	Nibyo rwose nkunda.
That's a long time.	Icyo ni igihe kinini.
And he would see nothing.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe yari kubona.
I want to know what you think.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo utekereza.
Another thing, though.	Ikindi kintu, naho.
You may not find it very good.	Ntushobora kubona ko ari byiza cyane.
Where he was, he did not know for sure.	Aho yari ari, ntabwo yari azi neza.
Probably very close.	Ahari hafi cyane.
No one now.	Nta n'umwe ubu.
That we are here is good.	Ko turi hano ni byiza.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
It's good to be home again.	Nibyiza kongera kuba murugo.
He asked questions.	Yabajije ibibazo.
Someone had to say something.	Umuntu yagombaga kugira icyo avuga.
He is here with me.	Ari hano hamwe nanjye.
Probably nothing.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo umuntu ashobora gukora.
What is it? 	Ni iki?
And there is no going back.	Kandi nta gusubira inyuma.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
Not much to look at.	Nta byinshi byo kureba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I guess it's his father.	Ndakeka ko ari se.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
He has nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe afite.
He has nothing.	Ntacyo afite.
He was one.	Yari umwe.
Almost every night.	Hafi ya buri joro.
It was all very difficult.	Byose byari bigoye cyane.
He was here, he was there.	Yari hano, yari ahari.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
I didn't feel well.	Ntabwo numvise neza.
There is food for everyone here.	Hano hari ibiryo kuri buri wese.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
This is it now.	Ubu ni ubu.
I'm going to do it.	Ngiye kubikora.
They are all one.	Bose ni umwe.
You have a problem here.	Ufite ikibazo hano.
I never thought about quitting.	Sinigeze ntekereza kureka.
Especially now.	Cyane cyane ubu.
Good scientist, too.	Umuhanga mwiza, kandi.
Everyone was there.	Abantu bose bari aho.
People here are smart.	Abantu hano bafite ubwenge.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Only.	Gusa.
Maybe you need to learn more.	Birashoboka ko ukeneye kwiga byinshi.
That's all.	Nibyo gusa.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
And he really didn't do anything.	Kandi rwose nta kintu na kimwe yakoze.
She must know where her child is.	Agomba kumenya aho umwana we ari.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
Coming and going.	Kuza no kugenda.
Let's go.	Ni gito.
I don't.	Ntabwo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
For me, that's right.	Kuri njye, nibyo.
He needs to know that we are talking.	Agomba kumenya ko turi kuvugana.
The snake is the snake.	Ejo ni ejo.
I have to stay away.	Ngomba kuba kure.
I also thought you saw that.	Natekereje kandi ko wabonye ibyo.
Until then, it was normal.	Kugeza icyo gihe, byari bisanzwe.
Seeing was very close to me.	Kubona byari hafi cyane kuri njye.
You can't tell what a person is.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo umuntu arimo.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri.
I'm afraid it's me.	Mfite ubwoba ko ari njye.
He loved everything.	Yakundaga ibintu byose.
I can walk.	Nshobora kugenda.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
I was really embarrassed.	Nagize isoni rwose.
And he enjoyed all that.	Kandi yishimiye ibyo byose.
Every woman has her needs.	Umugore wese afite ibyo akeneye.
I don't want to be in this house.	Sinshaka kuba kuri iyi nzu.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He just said something.	Gusa yagize icyo avuga.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta kintu na kimwe.
Who you want to be.	Uwo ushaka kuba we.
I should have known better.	Nari nkwiye kumenya neza.
This is your friend here.	Iyi ni inshuti yawe hano.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He knew where they were.	Yari azi aho bari.
That's what he wanted.	Ibyo ni byo yashakaga.
That's when he found out.	Icyo gihe ni bwo yamenye ko ahari.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
He may be there all day and it is possible.	Ashobora kuba ahari umunsi wose kandi birashoboka.
We have to learn to do it.	Tugomba kwiga kubikora.
This is the age of reflection.	Iyi ni imyaka yo gutekereza.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
Food.	Ibiryo.
But you have a problem.	Ariko ufite ikibazo.
This is the only one.	Uyu ni wenyine.
I can carry anything.	Nshobora gutwara ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I never felt that it was true for me.	Ntabwo nigeze numva ko ari ukuri kuri njye.
He was not in the film.	Ntabwo yari muri firime.
He looked closely.	Ari yarebye hafi.
He never felt bad for her.	Ntabwo yigeze yumva ikintu kibi kuri we.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
I did not do well.	Ntabwo nakoze neza.
She loves this movie.	Akunda iyi firime.
I'm not bad.	Ntabwo ndi mubi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka kuri byose.
He doesn't feel like he wants to be here at all.	Ntabwo yumva ashaka kuba hano rwose.
I know that.	Nzi ko aribyo.
I love it so much.	Nkunda cyane.
I want to help.	Ndashaka gufasha.
Work is not easy to come by.	Akazi ntabwo byoroshye kuza.
My wife.	Umugore wanjye.
A lot of questions, maybe.	Ibibazo byinshi, birashoboka.
I was embarrassed.	Nagize isoni.
However, there is one big problem.	Ariko, hariho ikibazo kimwe kinini.
He is a bad scientist.	Ni umuhanga mubi.
I don’t know what to expect.	Ntazi icyo agomba gutegereza.
I never liked this issue.	Sinigeze nkunda iki kibazo.
Not really here.	Ntabwo ari hano rwose.
And, it was easy to read and do.	Kandi, byari byoroshye gusoma no gukora.
He was not his thing either.	Ntabwo na we yari ikintu cye.
He has to try for the last time.	Agomba kugerageza bwa nyuma.
He would eat.	Yari kurya.
It was great right now.	Byari byiza kuri ubu.
I hope it's good.	Nizera ko ari byiza.
I believe he meant well.	Nizera ko yashakaga kuvuga neza.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
No one to talk to.	Nta muntu wo kuvugana.
.	.
Everyone has their own preferences.	Umuntu wese afite ibyo akunda.
I think of one.	Ndatekereza kuri kimwe.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
The problem is, he doesn't know how.	Ikibazo nuko, atazi uko.
Do you have an idea ?.	Ufite igitekerezo?.
This is not easy.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye.
We can't do enough.	Ntidushobora gukora bihagije.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
You have to come alone.	Ugomba kuza wenyine.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You can only say what you saw.	Urashobora kuvuga gusa ibyo wabonye.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
But not for long.	Ariko ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, birashoboka cyane.
You can't go wrong.	Ntushobora kugenda nabi.
Is the phone good? 	Terefone ni nziza?
maybe	birashoboka.
I can’t think of anything to do.	Sinshobora gutekereza ku kintu icyo ari cyo cyose cyo gukora.
There is something else about this.	Hariho ikindi kintu kuri ibi.
He could have any woman he wanted.	Yashoboraga kugira umugore uwo ari we wese yashakaga.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
I feel really good about that.	Ndumva rwose ari byiza kuri ibyo.
I thought of everything.	Natekerezaga byose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
And he was a small family.	Kandi yari umuryango muto.
Or maybe he is.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko ari we.
So far, he was right.	Kugeza ubu, yari afite ukuri.
He wasn't sure he would know how to do it.	Ntiyari azi neza ko yari kumenya kubikora.
That's all he ever ate.	Ibyo aribyo byose yigeze kurya.
We can all do better.	Twese dushobora gukora neza.
At the time, I didn't think about it.	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga kuri ibyo.
But that’s a good idea.	Ariko ni igitekerezo cyiza.
But one day.	Ariko umunsi umwe.
No one was in the room.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari mu cyumba.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
I am your daughter.	Ndi umukobwa wawe.
She was a beautiful woman.	Yari umugore mwiza.
Today is not the day.	Uyu munsi ntabwo ari umunsi.
However, it is true.	Ariko, ni ukuri.
He said he felt he had to tell someone.	Yavuze ko yumva agomba kubwira umuntu.
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
To speak is to hear someone speak.	Kuvuga ni no kumva umuntu avuga.
Not really.	Ntabwo ari mubyukuri.
It was just another thing.	Byari ikindi kintu kimwe gusa.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi ko hari impamvu.
He is one of them.	Ni umwe muri we.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
But the food is actually very good.	Ariko ibiryo mubyukuri nibyiza cyane.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
There is a lot to do about it.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora kubyo.
You don’t have to look very carefully.	Ntugomba kureba neza cyane.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
You can only hear the school.	Urashobora kumva gusa ishuri.
You can't tell what you like at that moment.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo ukunda aricyo gihe.
It was all about him.	Byose byari byinshi kuri we.
That's right.	Nukuri.
We have a child.	Dufite umwana.
I am very close.	Ndi hafi cyane.
I would like to have a meal.	Ndashaka kubona icyo kurya.
To think that there is only so much.	Gutekereza ko hari byinshi gusa.
I was not a family.	Ntabwo nari umuryango.
To live.	Kubaho.
But that is not all.	Ariko, ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He knew what he was seeing.	Yari azi ibyo yabonye.
He had a car.	Yari afite imodoka.
Now is the time to go.	Ubu ni igihe cyo kugenda.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You can't tell what he looks like.	Ntushobora kumenya uko asa.
We are really lucky.	Dufite amahirwe rwose.
We have to eat at the same time.	Tugomba kurya igihe kimwe.
She was beautiful and knew everything.	Yari mwiza kandi azi byose kuri byose.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
He was an expert.	Yari umuhanga.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
Shame on you.	Isoni, nawe.
He wants a lot of money.	Ashaka amafaranga menshi.
I think he is really smart.	Ntekereza ko afite ubwenge rwose.
He didn't want anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga.
You have both now.	Ufite bombi ubu.
I can't see the problem.	Sinshobora kubona icyo kibazo.
And especially not a woman like her.	Kandi cyane cyane ntabwo ari umugore nka we.
It is a new program.	Ni gahunda nshya.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
I like to see everything.	Nkunda kubona ibintu byose.
That is my gift.	Iyo ni impano yanjye.
In prison, he would not do so.	Muri gereza, ntabwo yari kubikora.
It would be a mistake.	Byaba ari amakosa.
They do not know what the truth is.	Ntabwo bazi ukuri icyo aricyo.
He feels lucky.	Yumva ari amahirwe.
He went a long way.	Yagiye cyane.
I was not a friend.	Ntabwo nari inshuti.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo bigoye.
I never heard of anything.	Sinigeze numva ikintu na kimwe.
It's a real mistake.	Ni amakosa mubyukuri.
That's all he did.	Ibyo ni byo yakoze byose.
We need everyone.	Dukeneye abantu bose.
And no one knew anyone.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi umuntu.
Maybe you can tell me.	Ahari ushobora kumbwira.
Everything was us.	Ibintu byose byari twe.
All of this is possible.	Ibi byose birashoboka.
He has to be scared.	Agomba kugira ubwoba.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ukeneye kumenya gusa.
You know how smart he is.	Uzi uburyo afite ubwenge.
I really like the guy.	Nkunda cyane umusore.
I doubt that.	Ndashidikanya kuri ibyo.
A son with a father.	Umuhungu ufite se.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
Friends.	Inshuti.
Anyway, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, yagiye.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I think she is your wife.	Ntekereza ko ari umugore wawe.
I know what you think.	Nzi icyo utekereza.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
Or did he think he could.	Cyangwa yatekereje ko ashobora.
But that is not the case with us.	Ariko natwe ntabwo aribyo.
And they were right.	Kandi bari bafite ukuri.
I should study.	Nkwiye kwiga.
He never thought it would happen.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ko bizaba.
We have to see.	Tugomba kubona.
I wanted to go out.	Nashakaga hanze.
He knew he was human.	Yari azi ko yari umuntu.
I think that's all.	Ntekereza ko byose.
But we have something else.	Ariko dufite ikindi kintu.
For him, that's probably the case.	Kuri we birashoboka ko aribyo.
That is not the case and will never do that.	Ntabwo aribyo kandi ntazigera abikora.
It's not a day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi.
He wanted to be alone.	Yashakaga kuba wenyine.
He did not know exactly who he was.	Ntiyari azi neza uwo ari we.
I'm glad you did.	Nishimiye ko wabikoze.
He probably wanted to hear it.	Birashoboka ko yashakaga ko yumva.
The gift was a lot of money.	Impano yari amafaranga menshi.
That's what everyone says.	Nibyo buri wese avuga.
Maybe it's not always easy.	Birashoboka ko atari ko buri gihe byoroshye.
He had not seen the coming.	Ntabwo yari yabonye ibyo kuza.
It is small and bad.	Ari muto kandi mubi.
He was behind me.	Yari inyuma yanjye.
After.	Nyuma ya.
Probably not after all.	Birashoboka ko atari ukuri nyuma ya byose.
I have some great things.	Mfite ibintu byiza cyane.
I wanted to do something to eat.	Nashakaga gukora ikintu cyo kurya.
She also loves it.	Akunda kandi cyane.
He is not one and will never be one.	Ntabwo ari umwe kandi ntazigera aba umwe.
He looked very young.	Yasaga naho akiri muto cyane.
No job.	Nta kazi.
You can make a lot of money.	Urashobora kubona amafaranga menshi.
Here, you have to work.	Hano, ugomba gukora.
There is always tomorrow.	Buri gihe hariho ejo.
I am grateful for the help.	Nishimiye ubufasha.
I don't know if it's today.	Sinzi niba ari uyu munsi.
What you want.	Icyo ushaka.
Eating too much.	Kurya cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It was good to wait.	Byari byiza gutegereza.
Your car was here.	Imodoka yawe yari hano.
In one day	Mu munsi umwe.
Especially before.	Cyane mbere.
You are in the house.	Uri mu nzu.
Maybe you have the truth.	Birashoboka ko ufite ukuri.
Well, maybe next time.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ikindi gihe.
You are also very beautiful.	Nawe uri mwiza cyane.
This is a good idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
It seemed good.	Yasaga naho ari byiza.
I'm not sure either.	Nanjye sinzi neza.
Why are you here?	Kuki uri hano?.
It is everything else.	Ni ikindi kintu cyose.
They were family.	Bari umuryango.
That's when he heard it.	Icyo gihe yumvise.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
This is normal.	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
Nothing very good.	Nta kintu cyiza cyane.
Sometimes he loved his hair.	Rimwe na rimwe yakundaga umusatsi.
Getting on the bus.	Kugenda muri bisi.
He is going to live now.	Ubu agiye kubaho.
It is in us.	Ni muri twe.
But no one has done that so far.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wabikoze kugeza ubu.
He is not as young as he used to be.	Ntabwo akiri muto nkuko byari bisanzwe.
I see, no.	Njye mbona, sibyo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He may be doing it wrong.	Ashobora kuba abikora nabi.
You don't have to say that.	Ntugomba kuvuga ko aribyo.
I should go.	Nkwiye kugenda.
He has what you need.	Afite ibyo ukeneye.
He said quickly.	Yavuze vuba.
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.
It's not like, girl.	Ntabwo ari nka, umukobwa.
There is something wrong with each of these.	Hariho ikintu kibi kuri buri kimwe muri byo.
But he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ariko yari azi neza ko azabikora.
He is doing something.	Hari icyo arimo akora.
Study every day.	Kwiga buri munsi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Igitekerezo cye ni cyo.
He is a very intelligent person.	Numuntu uzi ubwenge cyane.
Maybe it was better here.	Ahari byari byiza hano.
We can't.	Ntidushobora.
It would never have happened before.	Ntabwo byari kubaho mbere.
Busy.	Bisi.
Here it is tonight.	Hano hari iri joro.
But he did not say.	Ariko ntiyigeze avuga.
He didn’t want a lot of people.	Ntiyashakaga abantu benshi.
He was not above her.	Ntabwo yari hejuru ye.
It’s outside, where everyone could see it.	Ari hanze, aho buri wese yashoboraga kubona.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
Probably not very high, but inside.	Birashoboka ko atari hejuru cyane, ariko imbere.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
He couldn't have been better off.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kurenza igihe cyiza.
He knew nothing about his father.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi kuri se.
He said he could be.	Yavuze ko ashobora kuba.
However, you may be.	Ariko, urashobora kuba.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
We need to get more for everyone.	Tugomba kubona byinshi kuri buri wese.
The child felt scared.	Umwana yumvise afite ubwoba.
He did not know what to believe.	Ntiyari azi icyo kwizera.
This one was great.	Iyi yari nziza.
It was good that I found a place to live.	Byari byiza ko mbona aho kuba.
It is not much easier than that.	Ntabwo byoroshye cyane kurenza ibyo.
My friend wanted to say goodbye.	Inshuti yanjye yashakaga kuvuga neza.
And he knew everything about everything.	Kandi yari azi byose kuri buri kintu.
Or my dog.	Cyangwa imbwa yanjye.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
One day they were friends.	Umunsi umwe bari inshuti.
I want to know everything about him.	Ndashaka kumenya byose kuri we.
Sometimes a little.	Rimwe na rimwe gato.
I have enough of that.	Mfite ibyo bihagije.
I like to be outside.	Nkunda kuba hanze.
She is a very active girl.	Ni umukobwa ukora cyane.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
He was usually mentally retarded.	Mu bisanzwe yari atazi ubwenge.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
We can't do it right.	Ntidushobora kubikora neza.
He needed to get out of here.	Yari akeneye kuva hano.
I can't do it again.	Sinshobora kongera kubikora.
One day was one day.	Umunsi umwe wari umunsi umwe.
We can't look at anything else at home right now.	Ntidushobora kureba ikindi kintu murugo ubu.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
Everyone did a great job.	Umuntu wese yakoze cyane.
Me? 	Ninjye?
Anyway, man.	Ibyo aribyo byose, muntu.
You can't even tell what happened.	Ntushobora no kumenya uko byagenze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's together.	Ni hamwe.
At first, he was really bad.	Mbere, yari mubi rwose.
Too much early.	Byinshi cyane kare.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I also love that people like me.	Nkunda kandi ko abantu nkanjye.
You always talk too much.	Buri gihe ukunda kuvuga cyane.
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kubona aho.
But he could see.	Ariko yashoboraga kubona.
And for no reason.	Kandi nta mpamvu.
You can do that alone.	Urashobora gukora ibyo wenyine.
Or buy a car.	Cyangwa kugura imodoka.
In fact, he never did.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yigeze abikora.
He was an expert.	Yari umuhanga.
It would not be wise to try that.	Ntabwo byaba ari ubwenge cyane kugerageza uwo.
He saw everything wrong.	Yabonye ibintu byose nabi.
He thinks this is a good idea.	Yibwira ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza.
There is so much to see and do.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona no gukora.
Day by day.	Umunsi, umunsi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu cyiza kuri ibi.
I wonder if it's not true.	Ndabaza niba atari ukuri.
I mean a lot of money.	Ndashaka kuvuga amafaranga menshi.
And that's it.	Kandi ni uko.
And the boy is beautiful.	Kandi umuhungu ni mwiza.
I mean, in fact, everything.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko mubyukuri byose.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
He wanted more.	Yashakaga byinshi.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
Sitting on the floor.	Yicaye hasi.
Now he is scared.	Ubu afite ubwoba.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It was not true at all.	Ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
You can't work long hours.	Ntushobora gukora igihe kinini.
Everything was normal.	Byose byari bisanzwe.
I can’t think of all this right now.	Sinshobora gutekereza kuri ibi byose ubu.
John was.	Yohana yari.
One last thought.	Igitekerezo kimwe cya nyuma.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
That's not what he expected.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yiteze.
But he can't do it.	Ariko ntashobora gukora.
He is ready to speak.	Yiteguye kuvuga.
Niki.	Niki.
But there is one more thing we need to say.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu kimwe tugomba kuvuga.
I don't like a guy.	Ntabwo nkunda umusore.
I love that one too.	Nanjye nkunda uwo.
One thing is for sure.	Ikintu kimwe ni ukuri.
He must know his whereabouts.	Agomba kumenya aho yari ari.
I am grateful for the help.	Nishimiye ubufasha.
I can't do anything about it.	Ntabwo nshobora kugira icyo nkora kuri iki kibazo.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
She felt very embarrassed.	Yumvise afite isoni nyinshi.
I love dogs.	Nkunda imbwa.
I knew exactly what to do.	Nari nzi neza uburyo bwo kubikora.
He told me he was a teacher.	Yambwiye ko yari umwarimu.
You have to know how.	Ugomba kumenya uburyo.
Not always bad.	Ntabwo buri gihe atari mubi.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
There is something positive about that.	Hariho ikintu cyiza kuri ibyo.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
I didn't see much.	Ntabwo nabonye byinshi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko rwose ari hejuru.
But nothing good.	Ariko nta cyiza.
Sitting on top.	Yicaye hejuru.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
He looked at the girl.	Yarebye umukobwa.
Only son and father.	Gusa umuhungu na se.
He said he could not wait long.	Yavuze ko adashobora gutegereza igihe kirekire.
He knew who he was.	Yari azi uwo ari we.
But there is a very short time.	Ariko hari igihe gito cyane.
I mean, someone had to do it.	Ndashaka kuvuga, umuntu yagombaga kubikora.
She is happy here and wants to stay.	Yishimiye hano kandi arashaka kuguma.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I'm doing it.	Ndimo kubikora.
He would be a very good boy.	Yaba umuhungu mwiza cyane.
He would not exist.	Ntabwo yari kubaho.
However, this is not the case here.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
He had come.	Yari yaje.
I was a young child.	Nari umwana muto.
I got it right.	Nabonye neza.
You can tell me tomorrow.	Urashobora kumbwira ejo.
He wanted to get a job and make money.	Yashakaga kubona akazi no gushaka amafaranga.
I want it now.	Ndashaka ubu.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
It's always a day.	Buri gihe ni umunsi.
If the same thing, it is the same.	Niba ikintu kimwe, ni kimwe.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga kuri ibi.
We were all good friends.	Twese twari inshuti nziza.
I enjoyed this movie.	Nishimiye iyi firime.
That is not the case, and it is possible.	Ntabwo aribyo, kandi birashoboka.
I just feel.	Ndumva gusa.
Everything you do.	Ibyo ukora byose.
It was probably yesterday.	Birashoboka ko byari ejo.
This is not normal.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo ari uko bishoboka.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
I think that's true sometimes.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari ukuri rimwe na rimwe.
But there are many problems.	Ariko hariho ibibazo byinshi.
This is the fear of talking.	Ubu ni ubwoba bwo kuvuga.
He is in prison.	Ari muri gereza.
And this is exactly what happened.	Kandi ibi ni mubyukuri.
He saw that it was true.	Yabonye ko ari byo.
That is exactly what he needs now.	Ibyo aribyo akeneye ubu.
And best of all.	Kandi nibyiza muri byose.
The job is not.	Akazi ntabwo.
In fact we all.	Mubyukuri twese.
I don't mean to say.	Sinshaka kuvuga.
I hadn’t thought much about it.	Sinari natekereje kuri byinshi.
You don't need me.	Ntacyo ukeneye kuri njye.
Truth be told, that's all.	Ukuri, nibyo byose.
This is exactly what happened.	Hano nibyo rwose.
I got to do all that.	Nabonye gukora ibyo byose.
Or a house is possible.	Cyangwa inzu birashoboka.
That's right.	Nukuri.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
It was just a job.	Gusa byari akazi.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
She is now the only girl.	Ubu ni umukobwa wenyine.
Sometimes, he thinks about it.	Rimwe na rimwe, atekereza kuri ibi.
You can only do what you can.	Urashobora gukora gusa ibyo ushobora gukora.
It's not a day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi.
But there is more to this.	Ariko hariho byinshi kuri ibi.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko adashobora kuguma.
He may have something.	Ashobora kuba afite ikintu.
It's good to drive.	Nibyiza gutwara.
He was a young man.	Yari umusore muto.
He had nothing on him.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite ku muntu.
I need help.	Ndashaka ubufasha.
He does so by saying that he tried.	Abikora avuga gusa ko yagerageje.
Yes, we are here.	Nibyo, natwe turi hano.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
I think that is possible.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka.
I mean, someone you can talk to.	Ndashaka kuvuga, umuntu ushobora kuvugana nawe.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
I want to do it right.	Ndashaka kubikora neza.
The one he spoke to before.	Uwo yabwiye nka mbere.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
No doubt that is true.	Nta kibazo ko ibyo ari ukuri.
That was before.	Ibyo byari mbere.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza kuri we.
I was just a kid.	Nari umwana gusa.
Alone, possible, but he had his dog.	Wenyine, birashoboka, ariko yari afite imbwa ye.
He should have known better.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
We had a lot.	Twari dufite byinshi.
That's all work.	Ibyo byose ni akazi.
He doesn't really have to go far.	Ntabwo rwose akwiye kujya kure.
I'm glad he did.	Nishimiye ko yabikoze.
The food was good.	Ibiryo byari byiza.
Everyone has their own preferences.	Umuntu wese afite ibyo akunda.
He said he hoped everything would be fine.	Yavuze ko yizeye ko ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
But something else.	Ariko ikindi kintu.
There are so many people.	Hariho abantu benshi cyane.
Another thing he would study in prison.	Ikindi kintu yari kwiga muri gereza.
It is the same with many.	Ni kimwe na benshi.
He saw a lot on his own.	Yabonye byinshi wenyine.
We have no time or money.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya cyangwa amafaranga.
But he had.	Ariko yari afite.
But a little.	Ariko gato.
And no one ever did.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wigeze akora.
You too.	Nawe.
But he didn’t need to do it.	Ariko ntiyari akeneye kubikora.
Niki.	Niki.
You just have to wait and see.	Ugomba gutegereza gusa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza.
That's exactly what you want.	Nibyo rwose nibyo ushaka.
He should have known that.	Yagombaga kumenya ibyo.
The girl had no one.	Umukobwa nta muntu yari afite.
I saw.	Nabonye.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
It would be nice to be home.	Byari byiza kuba murugo.
And he.	Na we.
And it was all true.	Kandi byose byari ukuri bihagije.
You can't go on it.	Ntushobora kugenda kuri yo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But he could have taken less time.	Ariko yashoboraga gufata umwanya muto.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
That's exactly what he did.	Nibyo rwose nibyo yakoze.
I work every day.	Nkora buri munsi.
We have to do things, but we can't.	Tugomba gukora ibintu, ariko ntidushobora.
He would be a good friend.	Yaba inshuti nziza.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
He was no longer human.	Ntabwo yari akiri umuntu.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
But there is nothing you can do about it.	Ariko nta kintu ushobora gukora rwose.
Maybe for him, it is.	Ahari kuri we, ni.
But the problem is.	Ariko ikibazo ni.
His father was a young man.	Se yari umusore.
Today we just need to pick up the phone.	Uyu munsi dukeneye gufata terefone gusa.
In fact, he knew what to expect.	Mubyukuri, yari azi icyo yari yiteze.
He had a bad day.	Umunsi mubi yari afite.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
This is, after all, your day off.	Uyu, nyuma ya byose, umunsi wawe wo kugenda.
Today is obviously not a good day.	Uyu munsi biragaragara ko atari umunsi mwiza.
He didn't have much faith in her.	Ntabwo yari yizeye cyane muri we.
For me, everything is fine.	Kuri njye, ibintu byose ni byiza.
Good thing, how things went.	Ikintu cyiza, uburyo ibintu byagenze.
You can't say why.	Ntushobora kuvuga impamvu.
He was absolutely there.	Yari ahari rwose.
How he thinks.	Uburyo atekereza.
But he thought he did.	Ariko yatekereje ko yabikoze.
It looks simple enough.	Birasa byoroshye bihagije.
Something to watch.	Ikintu cyo kureba.
It's the same thing he said.	Ni ikintu kimwe yavuze.
If it weren't for me more than my son.	Niba atari njye kurenza umuhungu wanjye.
Or just one.	Cyangwa kimwe gusa.
He just told the truth.	Yavuze ukuri gusa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Well done and not good.	Neza kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
He did it in his own time.	Yabikoze mu gihe cye.
He was expecting this.	Yari yiteze ibi.
I can do it easily there.	Nshobora kubikora byoroshye aho.
He also started walking.	Yatangiye kandi kugenda.
Everything was up.	Ibintu byose byari hejuru.
I might try again.	Nshobora kongera kugerageza.
The car is gone.	Imodoka yagiye.
No job.	Nta kazi.
I hope he will be one.	Ndizera ko azaba umwe.
I guess you can do wrong.	Ndakeka ko ushobora gukora nabi.
It was not what he wanted.	Ntabwo yari icyo yashakaga.
You think of yourself.	Uratekereza wenyine.
I did the right thing.	Nakoze ibintu neza.
You can eat again.	Urashobora gusubira kurya.
I don't want to go.	Ntashaka kugenda.
He is not in this house.	Ntabwo ari muri iyi nzu.
No waiting.	Nta gutegereza.
He had said.	Yari yavuze.
I never wanted to give up.	Sinigeze nshaka kureka.
And, maybe.	Kandi, birashoboka.
There are so many.	Hariho benshi cyane.
I don’t know how that is possible.	Sinzi uko ibyo bishoboka.
Nothing, he chose.	Nta kintu na kimwe, yahisemo.
A person may be present soon.	Umuntu birashoboka ko yaba ahari vuba.
He knew how to walk.	Yari azi kugenda.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
You can do whatever you want.	Urashobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
This is my favorite.	Uyu numwe nkunda.
Let the woman.	Reka umugore.
I want something else.	Ndashaka ko hari ikindi kintu.
Easy is always good.	Byoroshye buri gihe ni byiza.
I do not understand.	Ntabwo numva.
They have things to do.	Bafite ibintu byo gukora.
I always want to win.	Buri gihe nshaka gutsinda.
But not here and not now.	Ariko ntabwo ari hano kandi si ubu.
I love it so much.	Nkunda cyane.
It is up to us.	Ni kuri twe.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But the time was too short.	Ariko umwanya wari muto cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
We don't have to.	Ntabwo tugomba.
Good.	Byiza.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza ko aribyo.
He will be here soon.	Azaba hano vuba.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kumenya gusa aho ugomba kureba.
Everything was fine and nice.	Ibintu byose byari byiza kandi byiza.
It would not be as if he had gone alone.	Ntabwo byari kuba nkaho yagiye wenyine.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza ntabwo ari imbere, mubyukuri.
After winning.	Amaze gutsinda.
In fact, that's not all.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo gusa.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I never saw it coming.	Sinigeze mbona ko kuza.
He was sure he was.	Yari azi neza ko ari we.
He was really in school.	Yari mu ishuri rwose.
I like work.	Nkunda akazi.
I want to learn how to do it.	Ndashaka kwiga kubikora.
You are at work.	Uri ku kazi.
I have to go back to school.	Ngomba gusubira ku ishuri.
Someone makes a mistake.	Umuntu akora amakosa.
I guess that’s something to do.	Ndakeka ko ari ikintu cyo gukora.
Most people were unemployed.	Abantu benshi nta kazi bari bafite.
You can't go far.	Ntushobora kuva kure.
I have to do it.	Ngomba kubikora.
He must feel proud of the work he has done.	Agomba kumva yishimiye akazi yari yakoze.
Good food.	Ibiryo byiza.
The truth about him.	Ukuri kuri we.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He seemed to know better.	Yasaga naho yari azi neza.
He had something to say.	Yari afite icyo avuga.
I can't see the car.	Ntabwo mbona imodoka.
That was a lot.	Ibyo byari byinshi rwose.
She is younger than me.	Ari muto kundusha.
During all that time, no one had said anything.	Muri icyo gihe cyose, nta muntu wari wigeze agira icyo avuga.
As he should.	Nkuko agomba.
As he does so.	Nkuko abikora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It would be nice to think about it.	Byari byiza ko utekereza.
When she had children.	Igihe yari afite abana.
He was very dressed.	Yari yambaye cyane.
It didn't happen that way.	Ntabwo byagenze gutya.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Niki kintu cyiza cyane.
Nothing about it.	Ntacyo kuri yo.
We have to work now.	Tugomba gukora ubu.
Too much to say.	Benshi cyane kuvuga.
Something for everyone.	Ikintu kuri buri wese.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
The food is excellent.	Ibiryo ni byiza cyane.
We just have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga gusa.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He says nothing.	Nta cyo avuga.
But today it was very difficult.	Ariko uyumunsi byari bigoye cyane.
He knew he had to wait.	Yari azi ko agomba gutegereza.
I know a lot of things.	Nzi ibintu byinshi.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
He wanted more.	Yashakaga byinshi.
This is not the case now.	Ubu sibyo.
I knew there was more to it.	Nari nzi ko hari byinshi.
He loved his daughter.	Yakundaga umukobwa we.
To have time	Kugira igihe.
You are nothing.	Ntacyo uri cyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He was a very good player.	Yari umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
He is smart.	Afite ubwenge.
He could see nothing here.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona hano.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
It is very good and simple.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byoroshye.
He wouldn't even look like me.	Ntabwo yari no kureba nkanjye.
He had a nice house.	Yari afite inzu nziza.
I was really lucky.	Nagize amahirwe rwose.
He wants the boy to do that.	Ashaka ko umuhungu agira ibyo.
They are just people.	Ni abantu gusa.
He only knew what he needed.	Yari azi gusa icyo akeneye.
He heard it all.	Yumvise byose.
Everything looks the same.	Ibintu byose birasa.
He did not know.	Ntiyari azi.
He has to do something.	Agomba kugira icyo akora.
I was not a good person.	Ntabwo nari umuntu mwiza.
I don't want to talk at all.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga na gato.
It looks bad.	Birasa nabi.
Everything is possible.	Byose birashoboka.
He is alone.	Ari wenyine.
He is upstairs.	We hejuru.
However, this is not good.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
I never liked this advice.	Sinigeze nkunda iyi nama.
No up and down.	Nta hejuru kandi hasi.
He did nothing.	Nta cyo yakoze.
Age is the same thing.	Imyaka ni ikintu kimwe.
You can only live.	Urashobora kubaho gusa.
I love everything.	Nkunda byose.
All alone.	Byose wenyine.
Who can ask for something better?	Ninde ushobora gusaba ikintu cyiza kuruta.
This was a lot.	Ibi byari byinshi.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekerezaga na gato.
Everyone wants to know what happened.	Umuntu wese arashaka kumenya uko byagenze.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
I know you're out.	Nzi ko uri hanze.
I like to drive.	Nkunda gutwara.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta kintu na kimwe yashakaga.
Not good for everyone.	Ntabwo ari byiza kuri buri wese.
Not much to look at.	Nta byinshi byo kureba.
It is not something we can expect.	Ntabwo ari ikintu dushobora gutegereza.
You would do it.	Wari kubikora.
It was down.	Yari hasi.
What a wonderful day !.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane!.
Anyway.	Icyo ari cyo cyose.
We don’t have a whole day.	Ntabwo dufite umunsi wose.
One did not.	Umwe ntiyari afite.
And walking dogs.	No kugenda imbwa.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
And someone needed help.	Kandi umuntu yari akeneye ubufasha.
It was very good and very good to eat.	Byari byiza cyane kandi byari byiza cyane kurya.
He never thought of one of those.	Ntiyigeze atekereza kuri kimwe muri ibyo.
Up here.	Hejuru hano.
That is very true here.	Ibyo ni ukuri cyane hano.
As bad as it can be.	Nkuko ashobora kuba mubi.
Like never before.	Nka na rimwe.
You can't tell anyone.	Ntushobora kubwira umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He used to be good at it.	Yakundaga kuba mwiza muri byo.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
That's all there is to it today.	Ibyo bizaba byose kuri uyu munsi.
All this time.	Muri iki gihe cyose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I think it's good for me.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza kuri njye.
Please let me go.	Nyamuneka reka reka.
I'm really into her.	Ndi rwose kuri we.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
We are all scared.	Twese dufite ubwoba.
It was not normal for me.	Ntabwo byari ibintu bisanzwe kuri njye.
A short time.	Igihe gito.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari imbere cyane.
Nothing too big.	Nta kintu kinini cyane.
No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze avuga.
You didn't know why.	Ntabwo wari uzi impamvu.
We need to think carefully about when to speak.	Tugomba gutekereza cyane ku gihe cyo kuvuga.
He likes to talk.	Akunda kuvuga.
Good advice.	Inama nziza.
This was yesterday.	Ibi byari ejo.
Especially one thing.	Cyane cyane ikintu kimwe.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibintu byose byari ukuri.
He knew what to do.	Yari azi icyo agomba gukora.
He didn't need time.	Ntiyari akeneye umwanya.
He looked at this.	Yarebye kuri ibi.
All we have is money.	Ibyo dufite byose ni amafaranga.
Anyone can and should and should.	Umuntu wese arashobora kandi agomba kandi agomba.
It was a problem.	Byari ikibazo.
I thought that was not a good idea.	Natekereje ko icyo atari igitekerezo cyiza.
He thought about it later.	Yatekereje kuri nyuma.
I can't do this.	Ntashobora gukora ibi.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi byiza kuri we.
And if this is true, then so be it.	Niba kandi ibi byari ukuri.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
There are so many.	Hariho benshi cyane.
And well, that's right.	Kandi neza, nibyo.
I only have the first thing.	Mfite ikintu cya mbere gusa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That was a lot for me.	Ibyo byari byinshi kuri njye.
I am a friend and I work hard.	Ndi inshuti kandi nkora cyane.
He didn't have to wait long.	Ntabwo yagombaga gutegereza igihe kirekire.
If you want to go far.	Niba ushaka kujya kure.
Obviously that is it.	Biragaragara ko aribyo.
Together.	Gufata hamwe.
We are just friends.	Turi inshuti gusa.
He has a very long time.	Afite igihe kirekire cyane.
He may be right.	Ashobora kuba afite ukuri.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
He said he had a house.	Yavuze ko yari afite inzu.
In all things.	Muri byose.
That's me	Uwo ni njye.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I do everything wrong.	Nkora ibintu byose nabi.
He wants to do it on his own.	Ashaka kubikora wenyine.
But he knew in that look that he was wrong.	Ariko yari azi ko ibyo byaba ari amakosa.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
He is, well, good.	Ni we, ni byiza.
He just has.	Afite gusa.
You can't wait for this one.	Ntushobora gutegereza iyi.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
But he was right.	Ariko yari yavuze ukuri.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birasa nkaho atari we wenyine.
I'm glad he is.	Nishimiye ko ari we.
I did that before.	Nagize ibyo mbere.
Probably they were.	Birashoboka ko bari.
In fact he saw nothing.	Mubyukuri ntacyo yabonye.
I guess you have.	Ndakeka ko ufite.
No one is in the room.	Nta muntu uri mu cyumba.
He had no idea.	Ntiyari yatekereje neza.
But there is more here.	Ariko hano hari byinshi.
I needed help.	Nari nkeneye gufasha.
At home.	Ku nzu.
In my opinion, it is not a good thing.	Njye mbona, ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza.
If any.	Niba hari.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
People are scared.	Abantu bafite ubwoba.
John would have none of that.	Yohana ntiyari kugira kimwe muri ibyo.
He was three years old.	Yari afite imyaka itatu.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
It was really nice to be here.	Byari byiza rwose kuba hano.
Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko ni byiza.
He now had his own money.	Ubu yari afite amafaranga wenyine.
It is not a time.	Ntabwo ari umwanya.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
They know better than I do.	Bazi kundusha.
You need to talk to someone.	Ukeneye kuvugana numuntu.
A very beautiful woman.	Umugore mwiza cyane.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni cyo kibazo.
He didn't want to talk at all.	Ntiyashakaga kuvugana na gato.
A woman can't really be for him.	Umugore ntashobora rwose kuba kuri we.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
The car came.	Imodoka yaje.
And it started well.	Kandi yatangiye neza.
All of this was great.	Ibi byose byari byiza cyane.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo mubyukuri.
I just saw that last thing.	Nabonye gusa icyo kintu cya nyuma.
I was so beautiful.	Nari mwiza cyane.
You told the truth for the first time.	Wavuze ukuri bwa mbere.
It's not good to hear. '	Ntabwo ari byiza kumva '.
It's for everyone, or nothing.	Ni kuri bose, cyangwa ntacyo.
What did he think?	Yatekereje iki?
I'm not a bad person.	Ntabwo ndi umuntu mubi.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
And in fact, it was.	Kandi mubyukuri, byari.
He knew it all by now.	Yari azi byose ubu.
Someone did one of those things.	Umuntu yakoze kimwe muri ibyo.
He could think quickly.	Yashoboraga gutekereza vuba.
You got a gift.	Wabonye impano.
We didn’t have things.	Ntabwo twari dufite ibintu.
He never thought of anything like that for me.	Ntiyigeze atekereza na kimwe muri ibyo kuri njye.
But today it is true.	Ariko uyu munsi ni ukuri.
He would have gone.	Yaba yagiye.
This is me for me.	Uyu ni njye kuri njye.
But I am alone.	Ariko njye wenyine.
Not only is he ready to do it.	Ntabwo gusa yiteguye kubikora.
He had.	Yari afite.
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
It's good to be good.	Nibyiza kuba byiza.
There are a lot of people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi.
There is fear.	Hariho ubwoba.
It was really good for everyone.	Byari byiza rwose kuri bose.
He wants to be alone.	Ashaka wenyine.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
all day.	umunsi wose.
But not always.	Ariko ntabwo buri gihe.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
I have a lot of money to work.	Mfite amafaranga menshi yo gukora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He didn't want to.	Ntabwo yashakaga.
I love the plan and I feel it.	Nkunda gahunda kandi ndumva.
This may have been good.	Ibi birashoboka ko byari byiza.
This really sounds like me.	Ibi rwose birasa nkanjye.
There are many problems.	Hariho ibibazo byinshi.
It was great to be with her again.	Byari byiza cyane kongera kubana na we.
I know nothing.	Ntacyo nzi.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
You did that.	Ibyo wabikoze.
I know what you mean.	Nzi icyo ushaka kuvuga.
It's better than ever.	Nibyiza kuruta mbere.
There is a small problem.	Hariho ikibazo gito.
He thinks it is normal and he likes to live.	Yibwira ko ari ibintu bisanzwe kandi akunda kubaho.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He has nothing to say and nothing to do.	Ntagomba kuvuga kandi ntacyo akora.
You want a baby.	Urashaka ko umwana.
Time to go far.	Igihe cyo kujya kure.
For me, that is the problem.	Kuri njye, icyo ni ikibazo.
I never heard of his problem.	Sinigeze numva ikibazo cye.
No.	Nta.
But here, the child is just a way to talk.	Ariko hano, umwana ni uburyo bwo kuvuga gusa.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
Can't find it here.	Ntashobora kubona hano.
People you can trust.	Abantu ushobora kwizera.
I don't know where.	Sinzi aho.
At that point, he would go with it.	Icyo gihe, yari kujyana.
The front was too far.	Imbere yari kure cyane.
He should have lived.	Yari akwiye kubaho.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
I can't find anything to do here.	Ntabwo nshobora kubona icyo gukora hano.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
Learning to go backwards.	Kwiga gusubira inyuma.
But this is really good.	Ariko ibi ni byiza rwose.
But he was right.	Ariko yari afite ukuri.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
And we have.	Kandi dufite.
He chose to do it.	Yahisemo kubikora.
There are tens.	Hariho mirongo.
Back home.	Gusubira murugo.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
He had no problem finding a house that day.	Uwo munsi nta kibazo yagize cyo kubona inzu.
Maybe he was just scared.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ubwoba gusa.
But that was the movie.	Ariko iyo yari firime.
Or we can't.	Cyangwa ntidushobora.
There is only one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu, si byo?.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Or for him.	Cyangwa kuri we.
You want to go fast.	Ushaka kugenda vuba.
No one has ever heard of it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze yumva.
It's you	Ni wowe.
People are an idea.	Abantu ni igitekerezo.
You need to know that they are.	Ugomba kumenya ko bari.
I really thought that for a long time.	Natekerezaga rwose ko igihe kirekire.
And he probably just needs a job.	Kandi birashoboka ko akeneye akazi gusa.
You don't have to do that.	Ntagomba kubikora.
He wanted to be nothing.	Yashakaga kuba ntacyo.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
But it would not come.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuza.
He can drive again.	Arashobora kongera gutwara.
I just thought this was great !.	Gusa natekereje ko ibi byari byiza!.
Not when he was very close.	Ntabwo ari igihe yari hafi cyane.
I don’t like a lot of people.	Ntabwo nkunda abantu benshi.
That was all there was to it.	Icyo gihe ibyo byari byose.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
It was easy and difficult.	Byari byoroshye kandi bigoye.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
Probably a lot.	Birashoboka ko ari byinshi.
That would be great.	Ibyo byaba ari ibintu byiza cyane.
He didn't know he was here.	Ntabwo yari azi ko ari hano.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
Not just his house.	Ntabwo ari inzu ye gusa.
You have what you want.	Ufite icyo ushaka.
She is a young girl.	Ni umukobwa muto.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko.
He had a house.	Yari afite inzu.
You don’t have to be too bad.	Ntugomba kuba mubi cyane.
They are not just scared.	Ntabwo bafite ubwoba gusa.
I have everything to do.	Mfite ibyo gukora byose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It was good and good.	Byari byiza kandi byiza.
He was about to move forward.	Yari agiye kugenda imbere.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He needed a plan.	Yari akeneye gahunda.
This is really great !.	Ibi mubyukuri nibyiza cyane!.
I should be in jail.	Nkwiye kuba muri gereza.
Nothing very good so far.	Nta kintu cyiza cyane kugeza ubu.
A lot of things are obvious.	Ibintu byinshi biragaragara.
I mean boy.	Ndashaka kuvuga umuhungu.
You can do this quickly and easily.	Urashobora gukora iyi vuba kandi byoroshye.
Very good, very good.	Cyiza cyane, cyiza cyane.
You can't tell me what to do.	Ntushobora kumbwira icyo gukora.
You have to live with yourself.	Ugomba kubana nawe wenyine.
I saw an expert in him.	Nabonye umuhanga muri we.
However, this is not the case today.	Ariko, si iki gihe.
If that were the case.	Niba uwo ari we yagombaga kuba.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
I have to stay away.	Ngomba kuguma kure.
But it is a simple matter.	Ariko ni ibintu byoroshye.
Out there	Hano hanze.
He could have drunk.	Birashoboka ko yashoboraga kunywa.
He was as good as ever, very likely.	Yari mwiza nka mbere, birashoboka cyane.
He, too, had.	Na we, yari afite.
He would not be in this one.	Ntabwo yari kuba muri uyu.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
Everything would be fine.	Ibintu byose byaba byiza.
He did as much as he could.	Yakoze byinshi bishoboka.
To go	Kugenda.
I did not do well.	Ntabwo nakoze neza.
I feel right.	Numva ari ukuri.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Good luck to him, good luck to him.	Amahirwe kuri we, amahirwe kuri we.
You have to eat well.	Ugomba kurya neza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
But he was not sure he could.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza ko ashobora.
He got what he wanted quickly.	Yabonye icyo yashakaga vuba.
That he used to play tennis.	Ko yakundaga gukina tennis.
Only, that's not easy.	Gusa, ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
Thinking is good.	Gutekereza ni byiza.
I was scared of him.	Nari mfite ubwoba kuri we.
He was at home, exactly where he was supposed to be.	Yari murugo, neza neza aho yagombaga kuba.
He is not a good person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mwiza.
He can't trust anyone.	Ntashobora kwizera umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I have something to do.	Mfite icyo gukora.
He heard nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yumvise.
Someone had to be.	Umuntu yagombaga kuba.
The thing is.	Ikintu ni.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I don't want to work.	Sinshaka gukora.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
You are a smart girl.	Uri umukobwa uzi ubwenge.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari abantu rwose, neza.
He was leaving tomorrow.	Ejo yari kugenda.
Far, far, far away from me.	Kure, kure, kure yanjye.
I wanted to know everything.	Nashakaga kumenya byose.
A little down.	Hasi gato.
Everyone should have gone.	Umuntu wese yari akwiye kugenda.
He must be in prison.	Agomba kuba muri gereza.
He was a good person who could be trusted.	Yari umuntu mwiza ushobora kwizera.
He is an expert, he is very good.	Ni umuhanga, ni mwiza cyane.
He went back.	Yagiye inyuma.
No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze avuga.
It was not high on his agenda.	Ntabwo byari byari hejuru kuri gahunda ye.
You can do as you wish.	Urashobora gukora uko ushaka.
I wanted to leave.	Nashakaga kuva.
And that's exactly what you have to do.	Kandi ibyo nibyo ugomba gukora.
There is one thing though.	Hariho ikintu kimwe ariko.
For him alone.	Kuri we wenyine.
But I think there is a problem.	Ariko ntekereza ko hari ikibazo.
He felt he had problems.	Yumvise afite ibibazo.
He is a very good friend.	Ni inshuti nziza cyane.
Does anyone know why? 	Umuntu wese uzi impamvu?
I can do it quickly on my own.	Nshobora kubikora vuba wenyine.
They were human.	Bari abantu.
It hasn't been long.	Ntabwo yamaze igihe kinini.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
I was scared right now.	Nari mfite ubwoba nonaha.
The party is great.	Ibirori ni byiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Every night	Buri joro rimwe.
Who do you like the most ?.	Ninde ukunda cyane?.
That was his family.	Uwo wari umuryango we.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
Where are we?	Turi he?
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo mubyukuri.
He was not behind her.	Ntiyari inyuma ye.
As he should.	Nkuko agomba.
This father is not his father.	Uyu se ntabwo ari se.
Or you shouldn't.	Cyangwa ntugomba.
You can't live.	Ntushobora kubaho.
Once upon a time for me.	Rimwe kuri njye.
They don't know what to do.	Ntabwo bazi icyo ukora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu nta cyiza.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
I think he can play.	Ntekereza ko ashobora gukina.
It didn’t work out very well in the end.	Ntabwo byagenze neza cyane amaherezo.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
He had problems.	Yari afite ibibazo.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
Being him.	Kuba ari we.
It was good to wait.	Byari byiza gutegereza.
Absolutely quit.	Kureka rwose.
She was not his wife.	Ntabwo yari umugore we.
He also looked a little.	Yarebye kandi gato.
There is no reason to do that.	Nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
He speaks well of his age.	Avuga neza imyaka ye.
It was not a good day for me.	Ntabwo wari umunsi wanjye mwiza.
But you have to say what you think.	Ariko ugomba kuvuga ibyo utekereza.
In the short term it was good.	Mu gihe gito byari byiza.
Everything was out.	Byose byari hanze.
I thought he was right.	Natekereje ko yari afite ukuri.
She thinks, well, that a girl can't.	Yibwira, neza, ko umukobwa adashobora.
It was really good for us.	Kuri twe byari byiza rwose.
No one had.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite.
I like	Njye nkunda.
I don't want to.	Sinshaka.
Me too.	Nanjye.
He saw nothing.	Nta kintu yabonye.
Or not at all.	Cyangwa ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I don't see it at all.	Ntabwo mbona mbere na gato.
He knows where he is.	Azi aho ari.
He was glad he was leaving school.	Yishimiye ko yari kureka ishuri.
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
He can't take it.	Ntashobora gufata.
It really was.	Byari rwose.
The girl was sitting there.	Umukobwa yari yicaye aho.
But that is probably easier said than done.	Ariko ibyo birashoboka ko byoroshye.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
You are a good child.	Uri umwana mwiza.
It will be great for all of us.	Bizaba byiza cyane kuri twese.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kureba.
He was very good at that.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri ibyo.
But it wasn’t just good.	Ariko ntabwo yari mwiza gusa.
He has, no.	Afite, ntabwo.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
Fear is the same.	Kugira ubwoba ni kimwe.
I think he went ahead.	Ntekereza ko yagiye imbere.
I am one always.	Ndi umwe buri gihe.
Everyone to me.	Abantu bose kuri njye.
He chose to return.	Yahisemo gutaha.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
It was too much for me.	Byari byinshi cyane kuri njye.
This is today.	Uyu ni uyu munsi.
For all.	Kuri bose.
He just wanted to be close to her.	Yashakaga gusa kuba hafi ye.
That was a long way off.	Ibyo byari kure cyane.
He is ashamed.	Afite isoni.
And this one.	Kandi iyi.
You can't stay long.	Ntushobora kuguma igihe kirekire.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I have to stop.	Ngomba guhagarika.
It was inside.	Byari imbere.
The person is alone.	Umuntu uri wenyine wenyine.
He was good, the only player.	Yari mwiza, umukinnyi wenyine.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikintu gito cyo kuvuga.
And he tried badly.	Kandi yagerageje nabi.
I'm scared too.	Nanjye mfite ubwoba.
But now he is not.	Ariko ubu we sibyo.
But they are not together.	Ariko ntabwo ari hamwe.
There is another big, bad time.	Hariho ikindi gihe kinini, kibi.
And anyone can do it.	Kandi umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
There is a short time.	Hariho umwanya muto.
Everything is possible.	Byose birashoboka.
Or even a little later.	Cyangwa na nyuma gato.
Trying to talk.	Kugerageza kuvuga.
But he was a real expert, as always.	Ariko yari umuhanga mubyukuri nkuko bisanzwe.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
But he knew he would do it.	Ariko yari azi ko azabikora.
It was good in everything.	Byari byiza muri byose.
I mean, buy.	Ndashaka kuvuga, kugura.
I have a back.	Mfite inyuma.
I knew everyone in the movie.	Nari nzi abantu bose bari muri firime.
I'm happy to help.	Nishimiye gufasha.
Yes, he could have, but in reality he chose not to.	Nibyo, yashoboraga kugira, ariko mubyukuri yahisemo kutabikora.
That's good enough.	Nibyiza bihagije.
He can't say what he wants.	Ntashobora kuvuga icyo ashaka.
Only, however.	Gusa, ariko.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari byinshi.
It was good to know that he was so close.	Byari byiza kumenya ko yari hafi cyane.
He needed help.	Yari akeneye ubufasha.
He wouldn't have known you were here.	Ntabwo yari kumenya ko uri hano.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
I wanted the most.	Nashakaga ibyo kuruta byose.
Money is not.	Amafaranga ntabwo.
That was good advice.	Iyo yari inama nziza.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
How is that possible?	Nigute ibyo bishoboka.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
Great time.	Umwanya mwiza cyane.
It's best to eat well.	Nibyiza kurya neza.
It feels good and good every day.	Yumva ari byiza kandi byiza buri munsi.
He is here to stay.	Ari hano kuguma.
She must be his daughter.	Agomba kuba umukobwa we.
Or things for his children.	Cyangwa ibintu kubana be.
I'm close.	Ndi hafi.
I think most of them are actors.	Ntekereza ko byinshi muri byo ari umukinnyi.
Everything is possible.	Byose birashoboka.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
Sometimes, this is not a problem.	Rimwe na rimwe, iki ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I had a great time.	Nagize igihe kinini.
I don’t know why it would be a problem.	Sinzi impamvu byaba ikibazo.
I enjoy everything I do.	Nishimiye ibyo nkora byose.
He asked why.	Yabajije impamvu.
I guess, not too much.	Ndakeka yuko, atari byinshi cyane.
We are not tomorrow.	Ejo ntabwo turi.
You don't have to.	Ntugomba kugira.
So much, so much.	Byinshi, cyane.
She is OK, but she has problems.	Ni mwiza, ariko afite ibibazo.
He used to be a good, hardworking person.	Yahoze ari umuntu mwiza, ukora cyane.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
Among his children.	Muri abana be.
No reason, really.	Nta mpamvu, mubyukuri.
Everyone is worried.	Abantu bose bafite impungenge.
For me, they were both the same.	Kuri njye, bombi bari umwe.
He just thought.	Yatekereje gusa.
I also needed to do it.	Nanjye nari nkeneye kubikora.
We have no time for that.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya kubyo.
I want to do it soon.	Ndashaka kubikora vuba aha.
.	.
I did not know.	Sinari nzi.
They were all out.	Bose bari hanze.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
They were good friends.	Bari inshuti nziza.
She loves her children.	Akunda abana be.
Most people have.	Abantu benshi bafite.
This is something else.	Iki ni ikindi kintu.
He seemed unable to read.	Yasaga naho adashobora gusoma.
But he has.	Ariko afite.
No need to go too far.	Nta mpamvu yo kujya kure.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately.	Natekereje cyane kuri ibi vuba aha.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
Not everyone.	Ntabwo ari abantu bose.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
It's really good.	Mubyukuri ni byiza cyane.
As was the case with all of us.	Nkuko byari kuri twese.
We have to.	Tugomba.
I just think there is more to it.	Ndatekereza gusa ko hari byinshi kuri byo.
I can't say for a long time.	Sinshobora kuvuga igihe kirekire.
Just not in the movie.	Gusa ntabwo uri muri firime.
You said	Wavuze.
In the movie.	Muri firime.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
It was not true at all.	Ntabwo byari ukuri na gato.
That’s why he knows the house well.	Ni yo mpamvu azi inzu neza.
He was not in this room.	Ntiyari muri iki cyumba.
I'm sorry about everything.	Mbabajwe na byose.
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
To the phone.	Kuri terefone.
We need everyone we can find.	Dukeneye abantu bose dushobora kubona.
There is something else here.	Hano hari ikindi kintu.
Or shame.	Cyangwa isoni.
One thing or another.	Ikintu cyangwa ikindi.
And all that.	Kandi ibyo byose.
And obviously he wanted something.	Kandi biragaragara ko yashakaga ikintu.
He never did well, he never did.	Ntabwo yigeze akora neza, ntazigera akora.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
We don't have the money to do that.	Ntabwo dufite amafaranga yo kubikora.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
Waiting was very difficult.	Gutegereza byari bigoye cyane.
You have to.	Ugomba.
This is the same time.	Iki gihe kimwe.
Stop making plans.	Reka gukora gahunda.
But you can't take that.	Ariko ntushobora gufata ibyo.
However, you can do it with.	Ariko, urashobora kubikora hamwe na.
Not much, obviously.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, biragaragara.
But that’s not what we have here.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo dufite hano.
Today.	Uyu munsi.
The day was beautiful.	Umunsi wari mwiza cyane.
We don't need to play well.	Ntabwo dukeneye gukina neza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
And there is a problem.	Kandi hariho ikibazo.
But that is not a big deal.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
He had taken his time.	Yari yafashe igihe cye.
He went to eat.	Yagiye kurya.
He thought about his plan.	Yatekereje kuri gahunda ye.
He was a wonderful person to be around.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane kuba hafi.
He is.	Ni we.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Nzi neza ko atari byo.
Either way, it wasn’t good.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo byari byiza.
He can make a lot of money.	Arashobora kubona amafaranga menshi.
Not recently.	Ntabwo ari vuba aha.
But he is not alone.	Ariko ntabwo ari wenyine.
I'm not happy today.	Uyu munsi ntabwo nishimiye.
Since then, there has been no turning back.	Kuva aho, nta gusubira inyuma.
It's not a good thing at all.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza rwose.
He asked.	Yasabye.
This was easy to do.	Ibi byari byoroshye gukora.
He didn't say anything to me.	Nta cyo yambwiye.
I would do anything.	Nari gukora icyo ari cyo cyose.
I think it's a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ari amakosa.
I guess you have to have a house for that.	Ndakeka ko ugomba kugira inzu kubyo.
I should have come to see it.	Nari nkwiye kuza kureba.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He was not the right boy.	Ntabwo yari umuhungu ukwiye.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo.
Someone.	Umuntu.
He thinks you did it.	Yibwira ko wabikoze.
He didn't know it existed.	Ntiyari azi ko ahari.
It is not one of them.	Ntabwo ari kimwe muri ibyo.
But the teacher is right.	Ariko umwarimu afite ukuri.
The farthest thing from it.	Ikintu cya kure cyane muri cyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
I can do everything.	Nshobora gukora byose.
He was the only one at the time.	Icyo gihe ni we wenyine.
Apparently he was scared.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ubwoba.
That is one girl.	Uwo ni umukobwa umwe.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
He needs advice.	Akeneye inama.
I have money.	Mfite amafaranga.
He can be easily scared.	Arashobora kugira ubwoba byoroshye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I found a house.	Nabonye inzu.
Reason for coming.	Impamvu yo kuza.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
At the moment we have nothing.	Kuri ubu ntacyo dufite.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
That was enough.	Ibyo byari bihagije.
I think he's more scared than anything.	Ntekereza ko afite ubwoba kuruta ikindi kintu cyose.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I can be one.	Nshobora kuba umwe.
I don't want any of that.	Sinshaka na kimwe muri byo.
He took the child.	Yafashe umwana.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I've seen a lot here.	Nabonye byinshi hano.
I saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe nabonye.
That was too much.	Ibyo byari byinshi cyane.
It was a beautiful day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza cyane.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
He wanted to talk to her.	Yashakaga kuvugana na we.
We are all behind him and he is definitely the right person.	Twese turi inyuma ye kandi rwose ni umuntu ukwiye.
He will never understand why.	Ntazigera yumva impamvu.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga.
That it was very fast.	Ko byari vuba cyane.
I can only be myself.	Nshobora kuba njye gusa.
I did everything.	Nakoze byose.
But it would not be easy.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuba byoroshye.
You know what you need.	Uzi icyo ukeneye.
It is not difficult to understand why.	Ntabwo bigoye kumva impamvu.
It's not difficult at all.	Ntabwo bigoye na gato.
Everything happened.	Ibintu byose byagenze.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I'm bad.	Ndi mubi.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
You can win or you can win.	Urashobora gutsinda cyangwa arashobora gutsinda.
It was something.	Byari ikintu.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
He is learning how.	Arimo kwiga uburyo.
This was not the case.	Ibi ntabwo byari byo.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Eat something good, and good before drinking.	Kurya ikintu cyiza, kandi cyiza mbere yo kunywa.
We were scared.	Twari dufite ubwoba.
The truth is possible.	Ukuri birashoboka.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
Obviously.	Biragaragara rwose.
I like that question.	Nkunda icyo kibazo.
We are all children in good times.	Twese turi abana mugihe cyiza.
I really needed a friend now.	Nari nkeneye rwose inshuti nonaha.
It may not be good.	Ashobora kuba atari byiza.
I have an idea.	Mfite igitekerezo.
I have a food friend, actually.	Mfite inshuti yo kurya, mubyukuri.
To talk	Kujya kuvuga.
It's just a job.	Ni akazi gusa.
He did not expect it.	Ntiyari yiteze.
There are many dogs.	Hariho imbwa nyinshi.
It's a good day.	Ni umunsi mwiza.
It was something else.	Yari ikindi kintu.
They are children.	Ni abana.
You can do all of this here.	Urashobora gukora ibyo byose hano.
He just says he needs more time.	Gusa avuga ko akeneye igihe kinini.
We have to try.	Tugomba kugerageza.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atagomba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
The problem is true.	Ikibazo ni ukuri.
I used to be bad at waiting.	Nigeze kuba mubi gutegereza.
His car had gone.	Imodoka ye yari yagiye.
I am very happy to win.	Nishimiye cyane gutsinda.
I didn't have time to do anything.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo gukora ikintu na kimwe.
Everything.	Byose.
Now he has to look ahead.	Ubu agomba kureba imbere.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
Not just me, but everyone.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa, kuri bose.
Women, women, women.	Akazi, akazi, akazi.
Just a question.	Ikibazo gusa.
But he eventually took over.	Ariko amaherezo yaje gufata.
But he had.	Ariko yari afite.
It seems difficult.	Birasa naho bigoye.
I can't say why today.	Sinshobora kuvuga impamvu muri iki gihe.
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
No later.	Nta nyuma.
But maybe not now.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari ubu.
You know you're in it.	Uzi ko urimo.
I'm out, too.	Ndi hanze, kandi.
I have to read.	Ngomba gusoma.
But he did not know where.	Ariko ntiyari azi aho.
I have nothing.	Nta kintu mfite.
It is not difficult to see why this is so.	Ntabwo bigoye kubona impamvu ibi aribyo.
But it doesn't look right.	Ariko ntabwo asa neza.
Something bigger than me.	Ikintu kinini kundusha.
I like the way you did it though.	Nkunda uburyo wabikoze ariko.
But none of this is true.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
As if he had no idea.	Nkaho adafite igitekerezo.
New phone.	Terefone nshya.
That would be true.	Ibyo byari kuba ukuri.
There are problems.	Hariho ibibazo.
Meditation time is short.	Igihe cyo gutekereza ni gito.
In fact, she was a very beautiful girl.	Mubyukuri, yari umukobwa mwiza cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I did nothing.	Ntacyo nakoze.
He said a lot.	Yavuze byinshi.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
You like this movie.	Ukunda iyi firime.
People know we can do better.	Abantu bazi ko dushobora gukora neza.
There is another problem.	Hariho ikindi kibazo.
Eating or.	Kurya cyangwa.
A lot of things about it.	Ibintu byinshi kuri yo.
Anything bad.	Ikintu cyose kibi.
He said he wanted something else.	Yavuze ko ashaka ikindi kintu.
I think he had some advice.	Ntekereza ko yagize inama.
I never felt like a woman.	Sinigeze numva ko ndi umugore.
Gone, gone.	Yagiye, yagiye.
I feel very good about that.	Ndumva ari byiza cyane kuri ibyo.
The woman must be this.	Umugore agomba kuba uyu.
Now we have another problem.	Ubu dufite ikindi kibazo.
You can't do much, you can't buy a lot.	Ntushobora gukora byinshi, ntushobora kugura byinshi.
He was right.	Yari yavuze ukuri.
I can't do why.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora impamvu.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
That's not difficult.	Ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
He heard something good.	Yumvise ikintu cyiza.
He would not do it alone.	Ntabwo yari kubikora wenyine.
He had everything.	Yari afite ibintu byose.
He had.	Yari afite.
I think about a lot.	Ntekereza kuri byinshi.
This is good.	Ubu ni byiza.
You can't be that.	Ntushobora kuba ibyo.
I'm just scared.	Mfite ubwoba gusa.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
But he can't do it alone.	Ariko ntashobora kubikora wenyine.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
Only.	Gusa.
He was a very intelligent man.	Yari umuntu uzi ubwenge cyane.
He can't, he shouldn't go.	Ntashobora, ntagomba kugenda.
That one-day retreat would be far from over.	Ibyo umunsi umwe gusubira inyuma byaba kure.
He was not going to leave here.	Ntabwo yari agiye kuva hano.
For him.	Kuri we.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
It was his car well.	Yari imodoka ye neza.
Yes, we have it all.	Nibyo, dufite byose.
And it's really not that difficult.	Kandi mubyukuri ntabwo bigoye.
I got a phone call.	Nabonye terefone.
One person has to work.	Umuntu umwe agomba gukora.
He never lived here.	Ntiyigeze aba hano.
Not that we are.	Ntabwo ari uko turi.
I need help.	Ndashaka ubufasha.
And he seemed scared.	Kandi yasaga naho afite ubwoba.
Up.	Hejuru.
I know exactly what it is.	Nzi neza icyo aricyo.
That's fine.	Aba ni.
It's good to feel good. '	Nibyiza kumva neza '.
He had to find his daughter.	Yagombaga gushaka umukobwa we.
We can't do much.	Ntabwo dushobora gukora byinshi.
She felt good.	Yumvise ari mwiza.
I hope they are not the last.	Ndizera ko atari aba nyuma.
I think it would be better in many ways.	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza muri byinshi.
I really should go home.	Nkwiye rwose gutaha.
It was my fault.	Byari amakosa yanjye.
He loves everyone and everything.	Akunda abantu bose na byose.
He didn't want to be around her.	Ntiyashakaga kuba hafi ye.
Everything, always.	Ibintu byose, buri gihe.
I didn't hear what it was.	Ntabwo numvise icyo aricyo.
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
He got to work.	Yabonye gukora.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
He has chosen enough for now.	Yahisemo bihagije kuri ubu.
All the food was at home.	Ibiryo byose byari murugo.
He asked what he should do.	Yabajije icyo agomba gukora.
He was just a man.	Yari umuntu gusa.
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
I never thought.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza.
He knew what he meant.	Yari azi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
That's exactly what you need to do.	Nibyo rwose nibyo ukeneye gukora.
That is not true at all.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri na gato.
You really are.	Mubyukuri uri.
There is something really wrong.	Hariho ikintu kibi rwose.
My prison.	Gereza yanjye.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
We have to make money.	Tugomba kubona amafaranga.
If anything.	Niba ari byose.
I mean, it was great.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko byari byiza cyane.
If not soon.	Niba atari vuba.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
He seems to be doing a lot of good.	Asa nkaho akora byinshi byiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He wanted to be alone.	Yashakaga kuba wenyine.
As usual	Nkuko byari bisanzwe.
She needs to quit drinking.	Akeneye kureka kunywa.
Whatever you want.	Ibyo ushaka byose.
I want to see one of those.	Ndashaka kubona kimwe muri ibyo.
He seems to be the one to blame here.	Nkaho ariwe ufite amakosa hano.
He is not in the house.	Ntabwo ari mu nzu.
And everything is true.	Kandi byose ni ukuri.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
He would not come.	Ntabwo yari kuza.
But he does nothing.	Ariko ntacyo akora.
He is now a friend.	Ubu ni inshuti.
In this case he must win.	Kuri iki kibazo agomba gutsinda.
That he would do it.	Ko yari kubikora.
There is nothing to eat.	Nta kintu cyo kurya.
This will be great.	Ibi bizaba byiza cyane.
He is my person.	Ni umuntu wanjye.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Ntekereza ko yashakaga kuvugana nanjye.
And he liked to hear the plan.	Kandi yakundaga kumva gahunda.
It's a mistake.	Ni amakosa.
Absolutely walking.	Kugenda rwose.
He looked at his father.	Yarebye se.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He just didn't know how to do it.	Gusa ntabwo yari azi kubikora.
However, it is not good.	Ariko, ntabwo ari byiza.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
I thought the food was great.	Natekereje ko ibiryo ari byiza cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
But he didn't go.	Ariko ntabwo yagiye.
If only it were me sooner.	Iyo yaba ari njye vuba.
You always want to know where a person is.	Buri gihe ushaka kumenya aho umuntu ari.
He thought of everything.	Yatekereje kuri byose.
He used to talk.	Yakundaga kuvuga.
He did.	Yabikoze.
He wants to go.	Ashaka kugenda.
They all have.	Bose bafite.
He didn't say anything to me.	Nta cyo yambwiye.
It was great in the house.	Byari byiza cyane mu nzu.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
Anyway, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, mu gihe gito ntacyo yavuze.
I never thought she would be so good.	Sinari natekereje ko azaba mwiza.
But we are not many people.	Ariko ntabwo turi abantu benshi.
You have to do something good.	Ugomba gukora ikintu cyiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He didn't have to do this.	Ntabwo yagombaga gukora ibi.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
Or he may not have.	Cyangwa ntashobora kuba afite.
I have a very small idea.	Mfite igitekerezo gito cyane.
One thing for sure.	Ikintu kimwe rwose.
In fact, he may be doing anything.	Mubyukuri, ashobora kuba akora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
He should not have been afraid.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kugira ubwoba.
And he could feel that he was not alone.	Kandi yashoboraga kumva ko atari wenyine.
He had a gift.	Yari afite impano.
Everyone knew why.	Abantu bose bari bazi impamvu.
That's right.	Nukuri.
He didn't know what to do next.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora nyuma.
They have a way of thinking.	Bafite uburyo bwo gutekereza.
Now I’m going to talk a little bit.	Ubu ngiye kuvuga gato.
I also think that’s a good thing.	Ndatekereza kandi ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
Here, we have nothing.	Hano, nta kintu na kimwe dufite.
That's not really what you have.	Ntabwo aribyo ufite rwose.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
If not now.	Niba atari ubu.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
I didn't see much.	Ntabwo nabonye neza.
We can't go beyond everything.	Ntidushobora kurenza buri kintu.
It was not for me.	Ntabwo byari kuri njye.
He told me things.	Yambwiye ibintu.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
We needed more.	Twari dukeneye byinshi.
Big or small.	Kinini cyangwa gito.
This is him.	Uyu niwe.
My son is not here.	Umuhungu wanjye ntabwo ari hano.
He probably came after you.	Birashoboka ko yaje nyuma yawe.
In.	Muri .
He had already seen it.	Yari amaze kubona.
Where he wanted to be.	Aho yashakaga.
It's something else !.	Ni ikindi kintu!.
You can quit sometimes.	Urashobora kureka rimwe na rimwe.
No one was in the house.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari mu nzu.
He must have been scared.	Agomba kuba yagize ubwoba.
But we can do a lot of good things, that's right.	Ariko dushobora gukora byinshi byiza, nibyo.
It will not be.	Ntabwo bizaba.
I like to do it.	Nkunda kubikora.
Nearby.	Hafi ya hafi.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
No one is lucky.	Nta muntu ufite amahirwe.
I am a woman.	Ndi umugore.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
I can't.	Ntabwo nshobora.
I want to live.	Ndashaka kubaho.
He didn't want anything else.	Ntiyashakaga ikindi kintu cyose.
It is above him but not inside.	Ari hejuru ye ariko ntabwo ari imbere.
We have money.	Dufite amafaranga.
I can work on the inside.	Nshobora gukora imbere imbere.
And he had this problem.	Kandi yari afite iki kibazo.
He had only one wife.	Yari afite umugore umwe gusa.
There is only one thing to do.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa cyo gukora.
He never thought that one day he could come so soon.	Ntabwo yari yatekereje ko umunsi umwe ushobora kuza vuba vuba.
Only in us.	Gusa muri twe.
But there is a chance.	Ariko hari amahirwe.
I really wanted to say.	Nashakaga kuvuga rwose.
I'm sure everything will be fine.	Nzi neza ko ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
Looks like, well.	Birasa, neza.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
But now there seems to be a problem.	Ariko ubu birasa nkaho hari ikibazo.
I was out.	Nari hanze.
This is a great day.	Uyu ni umunsi mwiza.
I can be one.	Nshobora kuba umwe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza cyane gusa, mubyukuri.
And I am.	Kandi ni njye.
It was all he could think of.	Byari byose yashoboraga gutekereza.
I was out.	Nari hanze.
Everything was simple at the time.	Ibintu byose byari byoroshye icyo gihe.
And he may not have what he wants.	Kandi na we arashobora kuba adafite ibyo ateganya.
This would be great.	Ibi byaba byiza.
He went to the movies.	Yagiye muri firime.
He said he had to leave.	Yavuze ko agomba kugenda.
She is a beautiful, beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza, mwiza.
Well, you're really here.	Nibyo, uri hano rwose.
There are many here.	Ni benshi hano.
He is asking.	Arimo gusaba.
You do things right.	Ukora ibintu neza.
You can do it at any time.	Urashobora kubikora mugihe icyo aricyo cyose.
He is not just sitting.	Ntabwo yicaye gusa.
That would help.	Ibyo byari gufasha.
And he has to be here.	Kandi agomba kuba hano.
Inside nothing.	Imbere nta kintu na kimwe.
And it is possible that this is true today.	Kandi birashoboka ko ibi ari ukuri muri iki gihe.
That would be great.	Ibyo bizaba byiza rwose.
He did not know who he was.	Ntabwo yari azi uwo ari we.
He didn’t make a good film in a short time.	Ntabwo yakoze firime nziza mugihe gito.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
I really want to be here.	Ndashaka rwose kuba hano.
It was great at the time.	Byari byiza cyane icyo gihe.
They are afraid of work.	Bafite ubwoba ku kazi.
I'm glad your son.	Nishimiye umuhungu wawe.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
I don't know who he was.	Ntabwo nzi uwo yari we.
His expectations were high.	Ibyo yari yiteze byari byinshi.
I just want them to live here.	Gusa ndashaka ko aba hano.
Well, you're here.	Nibyiza, uri hano.
I am absolutely wrong.	Mfite amakosa rwose.
I know you don't really want to do that.	Nzi ko udashaka rwose kubikora.
He knows his chances.	Azi amahirwe afite.
He does what he doesn't want to do.	Akora ibyo adashaka ko akora.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He never felt the need to speak.	Ntiyigeze yumva ko akeneye kuvuga.
I was a child.	Nari umwana.
Being here.	Kuba uri hano.
All he can see is him.	Icyo ashobora kubona ni we.
If possible.	Niba bishoboka.
He knew something.	Hari icyo yari azi.
That was almost all.	Ibyo byari hafi ya byose.
Once a week for a short time.	Rimwe mu cyumweru mugihe gito.
I want everything for him.	Ndashaka byose kuri we.
But he needed to be smart, and quick.	Ariko yari akeneye ko agira ubwenge, kandi vuba.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
Tom definitely isn't.	Tom rwose ntabwo aribyo.
This is obviously the case.	Ibi biragaragara ko aribyo.
I know everyone.	Nzi abantu bose.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo yagombaga gukora.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
He thought of her.	Yatekereje kuri we.
The day was beautiful and beautiful.	Umunsi wari mwiza kandi mwiza.
I have never heard of anyone.	Sinigeze numva umuntu uwo ari we wese.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
It was great to do it.	Byari byiza cyane kubikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The boy said he looked good.	Umuhungu yavuze asa neza.
I know I'm wrong.	Nzi ko nkora nabi.
For both.	Kuri bombi.
He said he was on his way to work.	Yavuze ko yari agiye kuva ku kazi.
I can do something.	Nshobora kugira icyo nkora.
I can get out of here.	Nshobora kuva hano.
He thought he was a friend.	Yatekereje ko ari inshuti.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
It will be true.	Bizaba ukuri.
He was swimming.	Yari koga.
I don't know what to do about it.	Ntazi icyo gukora kuri ibyo.
He seems to be doing a lot.	Asa nkaho akora byinshi.
Living in this room.	Kuba muri iki cyumba.
Looks like there's a problem.	Birasa nkaho hari ikibazo.
He was close, very close.	Yari hafi, hafi cyane.
He is talking a lot.	Arimo kuvuga byinshi.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi neza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
I don't know why anyone would be there.	Sinzi impamvu umuntu yaba ahari.
I was not human.	Ntabwo nari umuntu.
And here's the problem.	Kandi hano hari ikibazo.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
A friend asked him what had happened.	Inshuti ye yabajije uko byagenze.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
I do not have.	Ntabwo mfite.
He needs to go now.	Akeneye kugenda ubu.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He has to be a very good player.	Afite kuba umukinnyi mwiza cyane.
He was probably a young child.	Birashoboka ko yari umwana muto.
Being human.	Kuba umuntu.
There is a lot to come.	Hariho byinshi byo kuza.
You never did that.	Ntacyo wigeze ukora.
How to work.	Uburyo bwo gukora.
Whether inside or outside.	Yaba imbere cyangwa hanze.
It’s a matter of going backwards.	Ni ikibazo cyo gusubira inyuma.
That or work hard.	Ibyo cyangwa gukora cyane.
Just a house.	Inzu gusa.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
Apparently he had a lot of money.	Biragaragara ko yari afite amafaranga menshi.
There is a girl.	Hariho umukobwa.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
Many people.	Abantu benshi.

You said	Wavuze.
You are very skilled.	Uri ni umuhanga cyane.
I have children.	Mfite abana.
He knew everything.	Yari byose yari azi.
I can't figure out why.	Sinshobora kumenya impamvu.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
But it was difficult.	Ariko byari bigoye.
He had to.	Yagombaga.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
You always think you are doing something good.	Buri gihe utekereza ko ukora ikintu cyiza.
No one had ever spoken about school.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari wigeze avuga ku ishuri.
But this is not food.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ibiryo.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
I hope you finally know everything.	Ndizera ko amaherezo wari kuba uzi neza byose.
It's nothing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu na kimwe.
However, there is one problem.	Ariko, hariho ikibazo kimwe.
He was here.	Yari hano.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
One down, one to walk.	Umwe hasi, umwe wo kugenda.
I can get out of this.	Nshobora kuva muri ibi.
He needs advice.	Akeneye inama.
My daughter is embarrassed.	Umukobwa wanjye afite isoni.
We have a child.	Dufite umwana.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikintu kinini.
It was a lot of money.	Wari amafaranga menshi.
I just thought.	Natekereje gusa.
If not, let it be.	Niba atari byo, reka.
I don’t want him to feel like a job.	Sinshaka ko yumva ari akazi.
Nothing to see.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kubona.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He saw that.	Yabonye ko.
It's the same with him.	Ni kimwe kuri we.
There is a chance here.	Hano hari amahirwe.
If so, it was great.	Niba aribyo, byari byiza cyane.
They were scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba.
I don't really know what else to do.	Sinzi mubyukuri ikindi gukora.
Or this.	Cyangwa ibi.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He is everything you think you are.	Niwe ibyo utekereza byose.
He has a problem.	Afite ikibazo.
But that was good for me.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza kuri njye.
There is something here.	Hano hari ikintu.
I wanted to tell someone this.	Nashakaga kubwira umuntu ibi.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
He took everyone.	Yafashe abantu bose.
He was not down close.	Ntabwo yari hasi hafi.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
There is one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's all a gift.	Byose ni impano.
I don't have to talk to you anymore.	Ntabwo nkwiye kongera kuvugana nawe.
There is something I hear here.	Hano hari ikintu numva.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
To do.	Gukora.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
Maybe they would play with me for a while.	Birashoboka ko bari gukina nanjye igihe gito.
It was not down.	Ntiyari hasi.
It is not possible, but it is possible.	Ntabwo bishoboka, ariko birashoboka.
I have a baby.	Mfite umwana.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
I have a lot to say.	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
You don't have to try.	Ntugomba kugerageza.
If so, that's fine.	Niba aribyo, nibyiza.
You too 	Nawe?
.	.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He seems to have done well.	Asa naho yakoze neza.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
Until then, you can even buy this one.	Kugeza icyo gihe, ushobora no kugura iyi.
And the boy did it.	Kandi umuhungu yabikoze.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, igihe kinini.
I knew nothing about it until now.	Nta na kimwe nari nzi kugeza ubu.
Of course, it was not difficult.	Nukuri ntabwo twari bigoye.
I just believe.	Ndizera gusa.
It is possible, but it is possible.	Birashoboka, ariko birashoboka.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
They know how to do it right.	Bazi neza kubikora.
That's not what we have here.	Ntabwo aribyo dufite hano.
He needs to go.	Akeneye kugenda.
Or, we can just do it.	Cyangwa, dushobora kubikora gusa.
I can do it now.	Nshobora kubikora nonaha.
She is OK.	Afite neza.
To do so.	Kubikora.
He was not dressed.	Ntabwo yari yambaye.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
He is getting married.	Arimo gushaka.
Apparently he is close.	Biragaragara ko ari hafi.
His father chose.	Se yahisemo.
Alone.	Umwe wenyine.
That, he could have lived with.	Ibyo, yashoboraga kubana.
All this together.	Ibi byose hamwe.
I can do anything.	Nshobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I don't think that's right.	Ntekereza ko ibyo atari byiza.
It's really good.	Nibyiza cyane mubyukuri.
I don't have that problem.	Ntabwo mfite icyo kibazo.
But that was great.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza cyane.
He thought a lot this morning, he thought.	Yatekereje cyane muri iki gitondo, yatekereje.
Is there a way to do that ?.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora?.
We all need to be in this together.	Twese dukeneye kuba muri ibi hamwe.
He has no job.	Nta kazi afite.
That was a chance.	Ibyo byari amahirwe.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
I am making a plan.	Ndimo gukora gahunda.
No one is out here.	Nta muntu uri hanze aha.
They are not afraid.	Ntabwo bafite ubwoba.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
There are many opportunities.	Hari amahirwe menshi.
I never thought of him.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri we.
That's right, you have to eat.	Nibyo, ugomba kurya.
It's really not that hard.	Nukuri ntabwo bigoye cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Only one family.	Umuryango umwe gusa.
He had gone too.	Na yo yari yagiye.
He could have gone.	Yashoboraga kujyana.
I know the same thing is true.	Nzi ko ikintu kimwe ari ukuri.
However, the experiment failed.	Ariko, kugerageza ntabwo byagenze neza.
You don't have to look.	Ntugomba kureba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It's good to eat. '	Nibyiza kurya '.
Only.	Gusa.
I don't know what he thinks.	Ntabwo nzi icyo atekereza.
He had enough, in all things.	Yari afite ibintu bihagije, muri byose.
It is not always easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye.

He had everything one wanted.	Yari afite ibintu byose umuntu yashakaga.
If there are people outside.	Niba hari abantu hanze.
And here we are here.	Kandi hano turi hano.
And that's great.	Kandi ni byiza cyane.

He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.

Many people had the same opinion.	Abantu benshi bari bafite igitekerezo kimwe.
It is not without reason.	Ntabwo ari nta mpamvu.
Shame, shame, shame.	Isoni, isoni, isoni.
He says it's good.	Avuga ko ari byiza.
I didn't want to do that.	Sinifuzaga kubikora.
He didn't want to play with her.	Ntiyashakaga gukina na we.
And he looked good.	Kandi yarebye neza.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi atagomba kubona.
We are outside.	Turi hanze.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.

Not now, but one day.	Ntabwo ari ubu, ariko umunsi umwe.
I may have a small problem.	Nshobora kugira ikibazo gito.
He had everything in front of him.	Yari afite byose imbere ye.
It was really hard.	Mubyukuri byari bigoye cyane.
I think there is something about that.	Ntekereza ko hari ikintu kuri ibyo.
He went to jail.	Yagiye muri gereza.
And it is not difficult to know why.	Kandi ntabwo bigoye kumenya impamvu.
But we have nothing.	Ariko ntacyo dufite.
It was a great time.	Wari umwanya mwiza.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu uyu munsi wari mwiza.
As if we need more problems.	Nkaho dukeneye ibibazo byinshi.
Waiting for time is a problem.	Gutegereza igihe ni ikibazo.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
I have to be.	Ngomba kuba.
He never made friends.	Ntiyigeze agira inshuti.
In all things.	Muri byose.
It's too young.	Ni muto cyane.
You are doing things.	Urimo gukora ibintu.
No one knew what to do now.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi icyo gukora ubu.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
I am very ashamed.	Mfite isoni cyane.
The guy.	Umusore.
Being his friend, and everything.	Kuba inshuti ye, kandi byose.
I shouldn’t think he does.	Ntabwo nkwiye gutekereza ko abikora.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu.
Maybe later.	Birashoboka nyuma.
He is not ready for that.	Ntabwo yiteguye kubyo.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
A lot of people, people.	Abantu benshi, umuntu.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You know exactly why.	Uzi neza impamvu ari hano.
I didn't think so, I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekerezaga, ntabwo natekereje.
We need everything you have.	Dukeneye ibyo ufite byose.
You can't do that here.	Ntushobora kubikora hano.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He didn’t have it, after all.	Ntabwo yari afite, ibyo aribyo byose.
He had a gift.	Yari afite impano.
You don't need a gift.	Ntabwo ukeneye impano.
None of the above.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo hejuru.
I got my money.	Nabonye amafaranga yanjye.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
This is the way.	Ubu ni uburyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo birasa.
Obviously, the idea is true.	Biragaragara, igitekerezo nukuri.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Not when we have friends.	Ntabwo iyo dufite inshuti.
You too.	Wowe na we.
You are going to have.	Ugiye kugira.
I had something to eat.	Nari mfite ibyo kurya.
There are only mistakes.	Hariho amakosa gusa.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
I didn't know how to do it.	Ntabwo nari nzi kubikora.
Looks good so far.	Birasa neza kugeza ubu.
This was absolutely the case.	Ibi byari ibintu rwose.
It's not time.	Ntabwo ari igihe.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
I saw something.	Nabonye ikintu.
Or where he went to school.	Cyangwa aho yagiye ku ishuri.
A lot of people know this, which is good.	Abantu benshi bazi ibi, nibyiza.
He always had to work.	Buri gihe yagombaga gukora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
His idea is, maybe.	Igitekerezo cye ni, birashoboka.
He wanted to do something.	Yashakaga kugira icyo akora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
And that is all.	Kandi ibyo aribyo byose.
He doesn't know much.	Ntabwo azi neza.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
But not my daughter.	Ariko si umukobwa wanjye.
And there is another problem.	Kandi hariho ikindi kibazo.
He knew exactly what he meant.	Yari azi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari mwiza.
But that’s the thing.	Ariko icyo ni cyo kintu.
Maybe something else.	Ahari ikindi kintu.
He loved everything.	Yakundaga ibintu byose.
It was his last chance.	Nari amahirwe ye ya nyuma.
But are we ?.	Ariko turi?.
That's not what you want.	Ntabwo aribyo ushaka.
I needed something else.	Nari nkeneye ikindi kintu.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
He must live with us.	Agomba kubana natwe.
She was a woman.	Yari umugore.
Apparently you were close enough to that.	Biragaragara ko wari hafi bihagije kubyo.
You have the right wife at home.	Ufite umugore ukwiye murugo.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Now is not the time to wait.	Ntabwo ari igihe cyo gutegereza ubu.
And it was close.	Kandi byari hafi.
It's just money.	Ni amafaranga gusa.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
Or not so much.	Cyangwa si byinshi.
They know why.	Bazi impamvu.
You needed more.	Wari ukeneye byinshi.
I don't know anyone.	Sinzi umuntu.
You really are.	Urimo rwose.
And there is no reason to do so.	Kandi nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
They knew it was him.	Bari bazi ko ari we.
She was a very young girl.	Yari umukobwa muto cyane.
This will be great.	Ibi bizaba byiza cyane.
You have to be able to do this.	Ugomba kuba ushobora gukora ibi.
You're swimming.	Uri koga.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That we can believe.	Ko dushobora kwizera.
I'm looking for someone.	Ndashaka umuntu.
He wanted out.	Yashakaga hanze.
Bad girl	Umukobwa mubi.
I'm sure that's it.	Nzi neza ko aribyo.
But not much.	Ariko ntabwo ari byinshi.
He could have done that for a long time.	Yashoboraga kubikora igihe kirekire.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba byiza.
You can be one of us.	Urashobora kuba umwe muri twe.
Time is money.	Igihe ni amafaranga.
I really need to do it.	Nkeneye rwose kubikora.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
He was wearing his clothes.	Yambaye imyenda ye.
But it was really good.	Ariko byari byiza rwose.
And maybe he is.	Kandi birashoboka ko nawe ari we.
However, not everything happened.	Ariko, ibintu byose ntabwo byagenze.
We can never do that again.	Ntidushobora kongera kugira ibyo.
All of this was my fault.	Ibi byose byari amakosa yanjye.
What one does not have.	Ibyo umuntu atari afite.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yishimiye amafaranga.
He said nothing.	Ntacyo yavuze.
He could speak.	Yashoboraga kuvuga.
I know it's a bad thing to say.	Nzi ko ari ikintu kibi cyo kuvuga.
I'm glad to go back.	Nishimiye gusubira inyuma.
He was completely alone.	Yari wenyine rwose.
He should have done that more.	Yari akwiye kubikora cyane.
I want to be with him.	Ndashaka kubana na we.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
Going back is not easy.	Gusubira inyuma ntabwo byoroshye.
He didn't have much.	Ntabwo yari afite byinshi.
Congratulations to everyone.	Nishimiye abantu bose.
Money was everything to him.	Amafaranga yari byose kuri we.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
That looks good.	Uwo asa neza.
He is not a boy.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu.
I know it's me.	Nzi ko ari njye rwose.
And he can win.	Kandi arashobora gutsinda.
Much is possible.	Byinshi birashoboka.
I know that's not true.	Nzi ko ibyo atari ukuri.
At first, he was scared.	Bwa mbere, yari afite ubwoba.
I needed to go home.	Nari nkeneye gutaha.
He may have been right.	Ashobora kuba yari afite ukuri.
We were very close at the time.	Icyo gihe twari hafi cyane.
I'm glad you did.	Nishimiye ko wabikoze.
But being here is good.	Ariko kuba ari hano nibyiza.
It's good to read.	Nibyiza gusoma.
But in the end it was really good.	Ariko amaherezo byari byiza rwose.
You have to get the book.	Ugomba kubona igitabo.
You are here with me.	Uri hano hamwe nanjye.
He was there, upstairs.	Yari ahari, hejuru.
You are the only one.	Ni wowe wenyine.
Only good, very good.	Gusa nibyiza, byiza cyane.
I can see that.	Nshobora kubona ibyo.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
Everyone was probably scared.	Birashoboka ko bose bari bafite ubwoba.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
He looked at them all.	Yarebye bose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He seems to be doing it.	Asa naho abikora.
It's always late.	Buri gihe ni nyuma.
But that’s not the worst thing.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kintu kibi cyane.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
But my luck was out.	Ariko amahirwe yanjye yari hanze.
I hope you want to hear something about me.	Nizere ko ushaka kumva ikintu kuri njye.
The same thing happened with the woman.	Umugore na we ni ko byagenze.
But there is no turning back now.	Ariko nta gusubira inyuma ubu.
We are all.	Turi byose.
At the time, I felt good.	Icyo gihe numvise ari byiza.
I know you like to read.	Nzi ko ukunda gusoma.
I just saw his family far away.	Gusa nabonye umuryango we uri kure.
We really are.	Turi rwose.
I think it's a good thing.	Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyiza.
And that's good and that's it.	Kandi ibyo nibyiza kandi nibyo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You can't live that way.	Ntushobora kubaho gutya.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva ko ari imbwa.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Bottom line.	Imbere yo hasi.
He would not go forward.	Ntabwo yari kujya imbere.
I don't want it now.	Sinshaka ubu.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
Too much for everyone.	Kurenza byinshi kuri buri wese.
He had a lot of opportunities, a lot of opportunities.	Yari afite amahirwe menshi, amahirwe menshi cyane.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
This is very likely.	Ibi birashoboka cyane.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
However, it is possible.	Ariko, birashoboka.
Well done.	Nibyiza, igihe cyiza.
Maybe very soon.	Ahari vuba cyane.
And it is possible to think a lot.	Kandi birashoboka gutekereza cyane.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo byose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
You don't know for sure.	Ntabwo uzi neza.
This is your home.	Iyi ni inzu yawe.
He did it, almost every day.	Yabikoze, hafi buri munsi.
And he can't be.	Kandi ntashobora kuba arimo.
He came to his senses.	Yaje aho ari.
One is scared.	Umwe afite ubwoba.
I have faith.	Mfite kwizera.
He was just sitting.	Yari yicaye gusa.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
This is definitely not the case.	Ibi rwose ntabwo aribyo.
He knew he had to win.	Yari azi ko agomba gutsinda.
Getting the best out of it.	Kubona ibintu byiza cyane.
.	.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
Then it's good.	Nyuma ni byiza.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari kuri we.
I know he will.	Nzi ko azabikora.
You can't figure out why.	Ntushobora kumenya impamvu.
We are not afraid.	Ntabwo dufite ubwoba.
He is not the only one.	Ntabwo ari umwe wenyine.
In the short term, that's right.	Mu gihe gito, nibyo.
They had nothing, they had nothing.	Ntacyo bari bafite, nta kintu bari bafite.
I was for everyone.	Nari kuri bose.
Or food.	Cyangwa ibiryo.
Getting everything done.	Kubona ibintu byose.
We were all kids.	Twese twari abana.
There are so many here.	Hano hari benshi cyane.
You have this one thing.	Ufite iki kintu kimwe.
I didn’t know what to do with any of it.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora na kimwe muri byo.
He thought as he walked.	Yatekereje uko agenda.
That's not good.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
It will be really good.	Bizaba byiza rwose.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
It worked out well for us.	Byagenze neza kuri twe.
Probably not on top.	Birashoboka ko atari hejuru.
He did not want a frightened child.	Ntiyashakaga umwana ufite ubwoba.
At that point it was close.	Muri icyo gihe hafi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I hope he is.	Ndizera ko ari we.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
To take	Gufata.
It was very bad.	Yari mubi cyane.
Maybe food.	Ahari ibiryo.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
One day, one day.	Umunsi umwe, umunsi umwe.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I mean, there was a time.	Ndashaka kuvuga, hari igihe yari.
And no one said.	Kandi nta n'umwe yavuze.
There are many children.	Hariho abana benshi.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
He must have been expecting problems.	Agomba kuba yari yiteze ibibazo.
We have to do this.	Dufite muri twe gukora ibi.
He would not go.	Ntiyari kugenda.
You are my friend.	Uri inshuti yanjye.
It seems to be true.	Birasa nkaho ari ukuri.
My wife.	Umugore wanjye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I should be there.	Nkwiye kuba ahari.
It was not a plan before.	Ntabwo mbere yari gahunda.
My teacher was right.	Umwarimu wanjye yari afite ukuri.
However, this is a bad idea.	Ariko, iki ni igitekerezo kibi.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
You always have.	Buri gihe ufite.
He said.	Yavuze .
He seems to be doing well.	Asa naho akora neza.
He had a lot of people.	Yagize abantu benshi.
He would need money.	Yaba akeneye amafaranga.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
Really, really.	Nukuri, mubyukuri.
I wanted to go back a lot.	Nashakaga gusubira inyuma cyane.
He was not a good person.	Ntabwo yari umuntu mwiza.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
But he loved his time alone.	Ariko yakundaga umwanya we wenyine.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we yabikoze.
You know it is.	Uzi ko ari.
But here it is very clear.	Ariko hano biragaragara cyane.
I don't want anything else.	Sinshaka ikindi.
I don't think that's a bad idea.	Ndakeka ko ibyo atari igitekerezo kibi.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
It was good to work.	Byari byiza gukora.
And he is very professional.	Kandi ni umuhanga cyane.
He began to take over.	Yatangiye gufata.
I'm not sure about that.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibyo.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Just walking.	Kugenda gusa.
That's right.	Nukuri.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
Good father	Se mwiza.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
And he has problems.	Kandi afite ibibazo.
Anything.	Ikintu cyose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Apparently he didn't.	Biragaragara ko atabikoze.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	Kandi nta cyiza cyo gukora.
Especially the beautiful girl.	Cyane cyane umukobwa mwiza.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
We can't figure out why.	Ntidushobora kumenya impamvu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I didn't have one either.	Nanjye ntabwo nari mfite.
Recently.	Vuba aha.
It was not a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo.
But you are not in this.	Ariko ntabwo uri muri ibi.
This is good.	Uyu ni mwiza.
This is definitely a good idea.	Ibi rwose nibyiza kugerageza.
He chose to take action.	Yahisemo kugira icyo akora.
I have my own house.	Mfite inzu yanjye.
He can say what he wants.	Arashobora kuvuga icyo ashaka.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
But recently.	Ariko vuba aha.
He did very badly in the program.	Yakoze nabi cyane muri gahunda.
And he meant.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga.
Today, my son is one.	Uyu munsi, umuhungu wanjye ni umwe.
Everyone is doing well.	Umuntu wese akora neza.
They both had problems.	Bombi bari bafite ibibazo.
I know he's not, really.	Nzi ko atari we, ntabwo mubyukuri.
But you are at home now, with us.	Ariko uri murugo ubu, hamwe natwe.
And there is.	Kandi hariho.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I have a lot of that.	Mfite byinshi muri byo.
Not as he wanted to go tonight.	Ntabwo uko yashakaga iri joro kugenda.
We do.	Ni se.
Well, so far so good.	Nibyiza, kugeza ubu ni byiza cyane.
.	.
He wasn't sure if he could do it.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ashobora kubikora.
But only today.	Ariko kuri uyu munsi gusa.
A very young and very young boy.	Umuhungu muto kandi muto cyane.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
That's what you saw.	Nibyo wabonye.
But he knew in that look that he had failed.	Ariko yari azi ko atari byo.
The girl was alone.	Umukobwa yari wenyine.
Girl, maybe.	Umukobwa, birashoboka.
Something we need.	Ikintu dukeneye.
He liked his idea.	Yishimiye igitekerezo cye.
And he was scared.	Kandi yari afite ubwoba.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
I saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe nabonye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
He had a lot to say.	Yari afite byinshi yashakaga kuvuga.
And he looked good.	Kandi yasaga neza.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
I need to believe he didn't.	Nkeneye kwizera ko atabikoze.
We have a lot.	Dufite byinshi.
So far, he has not wanted anything.	Kugeza ubu, nta cyo yashakaga.
For everything, there is a time.	Kuri buri kintu, hari igihe.
That's right, another.	Nibyo, ikindi.
A gift to me.	Impano kuri njye.
That he really is not.	Ko rwose atari we.
I didn't see anyone.	Nta muntu nabonye.
There is one more thing.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo yari akeneye kumva.
He has time.	Afite umwanya.
He really did go.	Yagiye rwose.
He did not ask for anything.	Ntacyo yasabye.
The child was very young.	Umwana yari muto cyane.
I can think again.	Nshobora kongera gutekereza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It was a wonderful day.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane.
I have to have a problem.	Ngomba kugira ikibazo.
I hope this is great.	Ndizera ko ibi ari byiza cyane.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
It will be.	Bizaba.
Good food.	Ibiryo byiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He was thinking a lot about her recently.	Yatekerezaga cyane kuri we vuba aha.
Drink if you want to 'drink.	Kunywa niba ushaka 'kunywa.
We needed to go.	Twari dukeneye kugenda.
He said he was, but he was scared.	Yavuze ko ari, ariko agira ubwoba.
He looked around in fear.	Yarebye hafi afite ubwoba.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
I like cookies.	Nkunda kuki.
He is here to help.	Ari hano gufasha.
I don't want to wait.	Sinshaka gutegereza.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
I think we need to do that now.	Ndatekereza ko dukeneye kubikora ubu.
Maybe he knows something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo yaba azi.
And in that.	Kandi muri ibyo.
This is a good thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza.
We have no problem with that.	Nta kibazo dufite kuri ibyo.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
I love my gift.	Nkunda impano yanjye.
But he felt scared.	Ariko yumvise afite ubwoba.
He seemed to see nothing.	Yasaga naho ntacyo yabonye.
And you have to wait a long time.	Kandi ugomba gutegereza igihe kirekire.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Or maybe outside.	Cyangwa ahari hanze.
I have to live well.	Ngomba kubana neza.
I love gifts.	Nkunda impano.
But he is a young man.	Ariko ni umusore.
I'm sure he will.	Nzi neza ko azabikora.
I was very young.	Nari muto cyane.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
That's not what he said.	Ntabwo ari ibyo yari amaze kuvuga.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
Everyone wanted to take their money.	Umuntu wese yashakaga gufata amafaranga ye.
Driving fast.	Gutwara imodoka vuba.
He did not want to hear this.	Ntiyashakaga kumva ibi.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
No giving up.	Nta kureka.
The guy.	Umusore.
He must know why he did what he did.	Agomba kumenya impamvu yakoze ibyo yakoze.
Everything looks the same.	Ibintu byose birasa.
It was hard to say.	Byari bigoye kuvuga.
But you don’t have to read anything.	Ariko ntugomba gusoma ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
He has it all.	Afite byose.
I wondered what to do.	Natekereje icyo gukora.
I don’t really want this world.	Sinshaka cyane iyi si.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ubu abikora.
A wonderful gift.	Impano nziza cyane.
He loved it.	Yakundaga.
But he is not human.	Ariko ntabwo ari umuntu.
He would not go.	Ntabwo yari kugenda.
For one of those.	Kuri kimwe muri ibyo.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
For me this is the room.	Kuri njye ni iki cyumba.
I am nothing.	Ntacyo ndi cyo.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko ibyo atari byo.
I was one.	Nari umwe.
It's too bad.	Ari mubi cyane.
The problem is not us.	Ikibazo ntabwo ari twe.
But that's exactly what he said.	Ariko ibyo aribyo yavuze.
There is a wait.	Hariho gutegereza.
They were very high.	Bari hejuru cyane.
He doesn’t feel like a job, he feels like an opportunity.	Ntabwo yumva ari akazi, yumva ari amahirwe.
He needed time to think.	Yari akeneye umwanya wo gutekereza.
That's all there is to it.	Nibyo ibi aribyo byose.
It would be nice to see.	Byaba byiza kubona.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It was all but.	Byari byose ariko.
He usually asked why.	Mu bisanzwe yabajije impamvu.
He should have known better than to hear.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza kuruta kumva.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
He can play everything and he is a smart player.	Arashobora gukina ibintu byose kandi ni umukinnyi uzi ubwenge.
And he didn't want to.	Kandi ntiyashakaga.
But all was well.	Ariko byose byari byiza.
You have a nice house.	Ufite inzu nziza.
I need a car.	Nkeneye imodoka.
Obviously, the same thing.	Biragaragara, ikintu kimwe.
He did not know the car.	Ntabwo yari azi imodoka.
You need to make sure you are inside.	Ugomba kumenya neza ko uri imbere.
It's up to me.	Ni kuri njye.
I want it soon.	Ndashaka vuba vuba.
In the end, he.	Amaherezo, we.
You can even go to jail.	Urashobora no kujya muri gereza.
But there is one.	Ariko hariho kimwe.
I never had to do the same before.	Sinigeze ngomba gukora kimwe mbere.
We have.	Dufite.
I think he's scared.	Ntekereza ko afite ubwoba.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He knew what he meant.	Yari azi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He finally came to tell me.	Amaherezo yaje kumbwira.
Or enough.	Cyangwa bihagije.
We all needed it.	Twese twari dukeneye.
Bad idea.	Igitekerezo kibi.
You have to, you are his friend.	Ugomba, uri inshuti ye.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
And there is more.	Kandi hariho byinshi.
But you can't do that.	Ariko ntushobora kubikora.
I have to get everything right.	Ngomba kubona ibintu byose neza.
I know where he went after dinner.	Nzi aho yagiye nyuma yo kurya.
He thought only one of them looked like him.	Yatekereje ko umwe gusa asa na we.
It would be.	Byaba.
Eventually, one of us had to talk.	Amaherezo, umwe muri twe yagombaga kuvuga.
You are not bad.	Ntabwo uri mubi.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
Probably me too.	Birashoboka ko nanjye.
I got to talk and hear.	Nabonye kuvuga no kumva.
That's good for him.	Nibyiza kuri we.
I may be here.	Nshobora kuba hano.
That's great.	Ni byiza cyane.
He wanted to know who he was.	Yashakaga kumenya uwo ari we.
I can't have a family.	Sinshobora kugira umuryango.
He was not sure what to expect, what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo agomba gutegereza, icyo yari gukora.
But here is the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo.
I don't need	Ntabwo nkeneye.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi neza ko yari kuri njye.
There is a teacher.	Hariho umwarimu.
You have that in front of you.	Ufite ibyo imbere yawe.
We have to win.	Tugomba gutsinda.
I know why.	Nzi impamvu.
It was not something to do at the time.	Ntabwo byari ikintu cyo gukora icyo gihe.
He did not want to say much.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga byinshi.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
You know that's a good idea.	Uzi ko icyo ari igitekerezo cyiza.
He had a large book.	Yari afite igitabo kinini.
We didn't need to.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye.
I need to eat.	Nkeneye kurya.
I find it difficult.	Ndumva bigoye.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
Maybe we should.	Birashoboka ko tugomba.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
He knew he had problems.	Yari azi ko afite ibibazo.
One would not know that things are all but normal.	Umuntu ntiyari kumenya ko ibintu aribyo byose ariko bisanzwe.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Nibyiza kuruta inzu yanjye.
You want to hear what you are.	Urashaka kumva icyo uri cyo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It is also possible.	Birashoboka kandi.
Not the bottom line.	Ntabwo ari munsi yo munsi.
You are a good guy !.	Uri umusore mwiza!.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
The family was at home.	Umuryango wari murugo.
Not as usual.	Ntabwo nkuko byari bisanzwe.
The day was young.	Umunsi wari muto.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I just don't know what it is.	Gusa sinzi neza icyo aricyo.
I mean, he can be, when he has to.	Ndashaka kuvuga, arashobora kuba, mugihe agomba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You were beautiful, but not now.	Wari mwiza, ariko si ubu.
From that day on.	Kuva uwo munsi.
You can't think of anything to say.	Ntushobora gutekereza ikintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
We also have a good idea.	Dufite kandi igitekerezo cyiza.
I hope so here.	Ndizera ko hano hano.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
It's all for everyone.	Byose kuri buri wese.
But he seemed to want to say more.	Ariko yasaga nkaho ashaka kuvuga byinshi.
Or early in the morning.	Cyangwa kare mu gitondo.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
He is not a young man.	Ntabwo ari umusore.
He is a real person.	Ni umuntu rwose.
He can't have that.	Ntashobora kugira ibyo.
I can't do that.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora.
Here, no.	Hano, nta.
I'm not sure how.	Ntabwo nzi neza uko.
It is not far from me to do so.	Ntabwo ari kure yanjye kubikora.
In fact, there is no turning back.	Mubyukuri, nta gusubira inyuma na gato.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
We really need to have a meeting tonight.	Tugomba rwose gukora inama iri joro.
He is the father of us all.	Niwe se wa twese.
And none of us saw it.	Kandi nta n'umwe muri twe yabonye.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
We have another problem.	Dufite ikindi kibazo.
I feel right.	Numva ari ukuri.
He did not go to his house.	Ntabwo yagiye mu nzu ye.
And so far.	Kandi kugeza ubu.
But he was out.	Ariko yari hanze.
He can be very demanding.	Arashobora gusaba cyane.
But you know what.	Ariko uzi icyo.
Right now, everything is fine.	Kuri ubu, ikintu cyose cyiza.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
You are a good person.	Uri umuntu mwiza.
It looks so good.	Birasa neza cyane.
But if this was his son.	Ariko niba uyu yari umuhungu we.
But all of this is good to look back on.	Ariko ibyo byose nibyiza byo kureba inyuma.
We are close to the bus.	Turi hafi ya bisi.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
Everything he said was good.	Ibyo yavuze byose byari byiza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
It is always possible.	Buri gihe birashoboka.
Or be friends.	Cyangwa kuba inshuti.
He can read well.	Arashobora gusoma neza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He is not here now.	Ubu ntabwo ari hano.
That's not the case.	Ntabwo ari byo.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yishimiye kubona umwanya wenyine.
I haven't liked that for a while.	Sinigeze nkunda ibyo kuri we igihe gito.
I wanted to hear.	Nashakaga ko numva.
What to do ?.	Icyo gukora?.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
He had high expectations for me.	Yari yiteze byinshi kuri njye.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
During play	Mugihe cyo gukina.
He is smart.	Afite ubwenge.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, nibyiza, birashoboka gato.
He had to be alone, he thought a lot.	Yagombaga kuba wenyine, yatekereje cyane.
We were really worried.	Twari dufite impungenge rwose.
But that is possible.	Ariko ibyo birashoboka.
Or better yet.	Cyangwa neza.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
That's right.	Icyo ari cyo.
Shame.	Isoni.
But it was good and good.	Ariko byari byiza kandi byiza.
Wherever you go, he has to go.	Aho ugiye, agomba kujya.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He did nothing.	Ntiyigeze agira icyo akora.
All he wanted was money.	Icyo yashakaga ni amafaranga.
It's just upstairs.	Hano hari hejuru gusa.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I’m so glad you have a chance to win.	Nishimiye cyane ko ufite amahirwe yo gutsinda.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
You have a bad plan.	Ufite gahunda nabi.
He may know something.	Ashobora kumenya ikintu.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
You too.	Wowe na we.
He is not anyone.	Ntabwo ari umuntu uwo ari we wese.
No going at all.	Nta kugenda na gato.
I can't see.	Ntashobora kubona.
He was not ashamed.	Ntabwo yari afite isoni.
I know he has problems.	Nzi ko afite ibibazo.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
A short time is good.	Igihe gito ni cyiza.
You can do it or you can't.	Urashobora kubikora cyangwa ntushobora.
We have to have this.	Tugomba kugira ibi.
But that's not what he thinks.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo atekereza.
Normal learning.	Kwiga bisanzwe.
He is a very nice person.	Numuntu mwiza cyane.
Very good book.	Igitabo cyiza cyane.
This is not a problem.	Iki ntabwo ari ikibazo.
He had not gone.	Ntiyari yagiye.
I think this is true.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari ukuri.
Lots.	Byinshi.
We need to know who he was.	Tugomba kumenya uwo yari we.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekereje.
Both are ahead.	Bombi bari imbere.
I need it today.	Nkeneye ko uyu munsi yagiye.
Who, who, who.	Ninde, ninde, ninde.
I enjoy driving.	Nishimiye gutwara.
He was in his room.	Yari mu cyumba cye.
You want a party all the time.	Ushaka ibirori igihe cyose.
He knew he looked good.	Yari azi ko asa neza.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
He just didn't have much to say.	Gusa ntabwo yari afite byinshi byo kuvuga.
Everything you do is possible.	Ibyo ukora byose birashoboka.
For me, it was.	Kuri njye, yari.
There is something here.	Hano hari ikintu.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
Something to catch.	Ikintu cyo gufata.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
I can't go back to that.	Sinshobora gusubira kuri ibyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko atari byoroshye.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
It looks so good.	Birasa cyane.
It was good, maybe.	Byari byiza, birashoboka.
It was all a gift.	Byose byari impano.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Everything went wrong.	Ibintu byose byagenze nabi.
You have to read the book.	Ugomba gusoma igitabo.
It's good too.	Nibyiza kandi.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Nothing now.	Nta kintu na kimwe ubu.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I have never seen him do that before.	Sinigeze mbona ko abikora mbere.
I have all that I do.	Mfite ibyo byose nkora.
Walking here was great.	Kugenda hano byari byiza.
But that is not the case here.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo hano.
It was great to read.	Byari byiza gusoma.
You can stop reading now.	Urashobora guhagarika gusoma iki gihe.
I thought so.	Natekereje ko aribyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
Always	Buri gihe.
Study together.	Kwiga hamwe.
Take money now.	Gufata amafaranga ubu.
I want to go back to my house.	Ndashaka gusubira mu nzu yanjye.
They have a plan.	Bafite gahunda.
Only.	Gusa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari vuba cyane kuri njye.
And now.	Kandi ubu.
I'm going to work every day.	Ngiye gukora buri munsi.
You must not be superior to me in everything.	Ntugomba kundusha muri byose.
We needed money badly.	Twari dukeneye amafaranga nabi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He never felt bad about going to work.	Ntiyigeze yumva nabi kujya ku kazi.
They were not together.	Ntabwo bari hamwe.
Very confident, fast talking.	Kwizera cyane, kuvuga vuba.
He could do everything with her.	Yashoboraga gukora byose hamwe na we.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
Last resort.	Uburyo bwa nyuma.
But there is more to it.	Ariko hariho ibintu byinshi kuri yo.
Yesterday was the day.	Ejo wari umunsi.
I feel a little closer.	Ndumva ari hafi gato.
Apparently he has something to think about.	Biragaragara ko afite icyo atekereza.
He is close to me.	Ari hafi yanjye.
I knew a lot.	Nari nzi byinshi.
And away.	Kandi kure.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But the food was excellent.	Ariko ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
That's what people are.	Nibyo abantu.
Drink it all.	Kunywa byose.
But he doesn’t think about me.	Ariko ntabwo atekereza kuri njye.
We have to.	Tugomba.
Someone could talk.	Umuntu yashoboraga kuvugana.
I am very here.	Ndi hano cyane.
He was an expert.	Yari umuhanga.
Everything is great.	Byose ni byiza cyane.
It was always a car, just not my car.	Buri gihe yari imodoka, gusa ntabwo yari imodoka yanjye.
He had to learn to see and hear.	Yagombaga kwiga kubona no kumva.
This was definitely not a good idea.	Ibi rwose ntabwo byari ikibazo cyiza.
Eventually, everyone would do it.	Amaherezo, bose bari kubikora.
I can do a lot.	Nshobora gukora byinshi.
Everything was normal, easy.	Byose byari bisanzwe, byoroshye.
They may be scared.	Birashoboka ko bafite ubwoba.
But they are always human.	Ariko buri gihe ni abantu.
You can have something good.	Urashobora kugira ikintu cyiza.
He never thought it was possible.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ko bishoboka.
That's what he says.	Icyo ni cyo kintu avuga.
Making clothes.	Gukora imyenda.
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
He is happy to do so.	Yishimiye kubikora.
But, on the positive side.	Ariko, ku kintu cyiza.
A lot of things, really.	Ibintu byinshi, mubyukuri.
You have to try !.	Ugomba kugerageza!.
He could see everything.	Yashoboraga kubona byose.
It is a beautiful, beautiful house.	Ni inzu nziza, nziza cyane.
He goes outside.	Agenda hanze.
He was right on time.	Yari afite ukuri ku gihe.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
Maybe too much.	Ahari byinshi cyane.
And this is in the morning.	Kandi ibi ni mu gitondo.
No one is around.	Nta muntu uri hafi.
That wasn't enough for him.	Ntabwo byari bihagije kuri we.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
This was very difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye cyane.
I do not mean to say that there is nothing wrong with that.	Ntashaka kuvuga ko nta kibi.
I think they are in this together.	Ndakeka ko bari muri ibi hamwe.
If so, he probably knew everything.	Niba aribyo, birashoboka ko yari azi byose.
And the baby is so cute.	Kandi umwana ni mwiza cyane.
Out here, man.	Hanze aha, umuntu.
You have to take the time.	Ugomba gufata igihe.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
He needed a friend.	Yari akeneye inshuti.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
You can say what you like.	Urashobora kuvuga ibyo ukunda.
I mean, he's a teacher.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ari umwarimu.
Yesterday, he did it right.	Ejo, yabikoze neza.
It's a privilege.	Ni amahirwe.
Reading hard to do.	Gusoma cyane gukora.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
Can you see 	Urashobora kubona?
I have to get out of here.	Ngomba kuva hano.
Especially dogs.	Cyane cyane imbwa.
One of the many.	Umwe muri benshi.
You should too.	Nawe ugomba.
He probably didn't come alone.	Birashoboka ko atari yaje wenyine.
He is in the house with you.	Ari mu nzu nawe.
He can't stay.	Ntashobora kuguma.
She thought she was beautiful.	Yatekereje ko ari mwiza.
But that is probably why.	Ariko birashoboka ko ari yo mpamvu.
People were scared.	Abantu bari bafite ubwoba.
I would not work.	Sinari gukora.
I don't want to go home.	Ntashaka gutaha.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
We have, however, to go too far.	Dufite, ariko, kujya kure cyane.
I may be working tonight.	Nshobora kuba nkora iri joro.
And no one had seen it.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe wari wabonye.
There are so many people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi cyane.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe no guhagarika.
Question.	Ikibazo.
I appreciate your time.	Nishimiye umwanya wawe.
.	.
But it went wrong.	Ariko byagenze nabi.
This is very good.	Iyi ni nziza cyane.
You think you're drinking too much.	Utekereza kunywa cyane.
He would not go.	Ntiyari kugenda.
It was a lot for him to do.	Byari byinshi kuri we gukora.
At one point he was not scared.	Igihe kimwe ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
I was very lucky.	Nagize amahirwe menshi.
I'm glad to go.	Nishimiye kugenda.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
I know you're out.	Nzi ko uri hanze.
You have to look closely.	Ugomba kureba hafi.
He doesn't want to do anything.	Ntashaka gukora ikintu.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
You know how to do this.	Uzi gukora ibi.
Nothing about it.	Ntacyo kuri yo.
But for me.	Ariko kuri njye.
I thought he was bad.	Natekerezaga ko ari mubi.
Or outside of him alone.	Cyangwa hanze ye wenyine.
I don't know my age.	Sinzi imyaka yanjye.
We have to act fast.	Tugomba gukora vuba.
Or he was out.	Cyangwa yari hanze.
You have a lot to do.	Ufite byinshi byo gukora.
John finally feels at home.	John amaherezo yumva ari murugo.
But it is not good.	Ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
He has to be here.	Agomba kuba hano.
You can do anything.	Urashobora gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
The car was here.	Imodoka yari hano.
But there is no need to stay here.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo kuguma hano.
The only problem is time.	Ikibazo gusa ni igihe.
They were your family.	Bari umuryango wawe.
You really think so.	Uratekereza rwose.
And it’s not scary, but just real.	Kandi ntabwo ari ubwoba, ariko mubyukuri gusa.
He thought this was his gift.	Yatekereje ko iyi ari impano ye.
He also loved cars.	Yakundaga kandi imodoka.
I don't feel it every day.	Ntabwo numva buri munsi.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo mfite.
And this is it.	Kandi ni iyi.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
It was always good.	Byari byiza buri gihe.
John wants to live.	Yohana arashaka kubaho.
He is alone.	Ari wenyine.
The chances of a plan to work are far from certain.	Amahirwe ya gahunda yo gukora ni kure cyane.
The party would have been very soon.	Ibirori byari kuba vuba cyane.
I feel very good.	Numva ari byiza cyane.
I found the door.	Nabonye umuryango.
He was scared, that's for sure.	Yari afite ubwoba, nibyo rwose.
He thought maybe he knew how to win.	Yatekereje ko ahari azi gutsinda.
The truth is.	Ukuri ni uko.
I was about to leave.	Nari ngiye kugenda.
It’s not always a good thing.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari ikintu cyiza.
He was the only one here.	Yari wenyine wenyine hano.
You didn't mention what the problem was.	Ntabwo wavuze ikibazo icyo ari cyo.
You are close.	Uri hafi.
And more.	Kandi byinshi.
But he says nothing.	Ariko ntacyo avuga.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That would have been much easier.	Ibyo byari kuba byoroshye cyane.
Sometimes it looks good.	Rimwe na rimwe birasa neza.
You can go home.	Urashobora gusubira murugo.
Everything, whatever it is, is what we are here for.	Ibintu byose, ikintu icyo aricyo cyose, nibyo turi hano.
I did.	Nakoze.
And it’s definitely possible to be lucky.	Kandi birashoboka rwose kuba amahirwe.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
That was too much.	Ibyo byari byinshi cyane.
Someone who is scared.	Umuntu ufite ubwoba.
He mentioned his daughter.	Yavuze umukobwa we.
I'm worried about him.	Mfite impungenge kuri we.
I know you have to do this.	Nzi ko ugomba gukora ibi.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
'	'
This movie was great.	Iyi firime yari nziza cyane.
Jobs are plentiful and everyone has a job.	Akazi ni benshi kandi abantu bose bafite akazi.
You don't have to tell me that.	Ntugomba kumbwira ibyo.
Really up there.	Mubyukuri hejuru aho.
But it is not his fault.	Ariko ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
Nothing to hear.	Nta kintu cyo kumva.
.	.
He tried to be.	Yagerageje kuba.
No one can do that.	Ntabwo umuntu uwo ari we wese ashobora kubikora.
The problem is, we can't.	Ibibazo ni, ntidushobora.
He is ready.	Yiteguye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibyo ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
Not really.	Ntabwo ari mubyukuri.
I have to work hard.	Ngomba gukora cyane.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
A young woman.	Umugore muto.
Well, well, well.	Nibyiza, nibyiza.
Really, I really want to be here.	Nukuri, ndashaka rwose kuba hano.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
You have to tell me everything.	Ugomba kumbwira byose.
And what to drink.	Kandi icyo kunywa.
And not at home.	Kandi ntabwo ari murugo.
No one was in anything.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari mu kintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
You have to.	Ugomba.
I need clothes.	Nkeneye imyenda.
I need help now.	Nkeneye ubufasha ubu.
There are many children here.	Hano hari abana benshi.
And, yes, I realize I'm the billionth person to make that joke.	Kandi ,, ntabwo mubyukuri byari byoroshye.
I want to read inside.	Ndashaka gusoma imbere.
Maybe he can talk to you.	Ahari ashobora kuvugana nawe.
I love talking to you.	Nkunda cyane kuvugana nawe.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga.
I just wanted to see my family for a while.	Nashakaga gusa kubona umuryango wanjye igihe gito.
The interior is beautiful.	Imbere ni nziza.
Eating, that's right.	Kurya, nibyo.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
Nice to meet you both.	Nishimiye kubona bombi.
I never worked in prison.	Sinigeze nkora igihe muri gereza.
But her son was another matter.	Ariko umuhungu we yari ikindi kibazo.
But you can tell me whatever you want.	Ariko urashobora kumbwira icyo ushaka cyose.
She was beautiful too.	Yari mwiza kandi.
He knew he could.	Yari azi ko ashobora.
There is something we all need to know.	Hariho ikintu twese dukeneye kumenya.
I don't want his money.	Sinshaka amafaranga ye.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora hano.
But he knows things.	Ariko azi ibintu.
Trying to go early.	Kugerageza kugenda kare.
He said nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yavuze.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
If not, that's fine.	Niba atari byo, nibyiza rwose.
He was far away.	Yari kure.
And he wanted to be.	Kandi yashakaga kuba.
I can't say why.	Sinshobora kuvuga impamvu.
I was not very good.	Ntabwo nari mwiza cyane.
You have to do something good.	Ugomba gukora ikintu cyiza.
I know they have the truth.	Nzi ko bafite ukuri.
You didn't say what happened.	Ntabwo wavuze uko byagenze.
I like to think that the book is true.	Nkunda gutekereza ko igitabo ari ukuri.
That's right.	Ko aribyo.
I didn't see it either.	Nanjye sinigeze mbona.
I should have eaten something.	Nari nkwiye kurya ikintu.
Probably the same.	Ahari kimwe.
He worked for a long time.	Yakoze igihe kirekire.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
But that's exactly what he heard.	Ariko ni byo yumvise.
Failure to do so.	Kutabikora.
He was not afraid.	Ntiyari afite ubwoba.
They were worried.	Bari bafite impungenge.
I know how to do it.	Nzi kubikora.
You did it right.	Wabikoze neza.
Thinking about everything.	Gutekereza kuri buri kintu.
Everything was true and there was no turning back.	Byose byari ukuri kandi nta gusubira inyuma.
It's too soon, now.	Ni vuba cyane, ubu.
But that is something else.	Ariko icyo ni ikindi kintu.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
He worked hard for both of them.	Yakoze cyane kuri bombi.
Do you know where he is? 	Uzi aho ari?
.	.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I have never heard of this.	Sinigeze numva ibi.
It is his opinion.	Ni igitekerezo cye.
I'm bad.	Ndi mubi.
I didn't hear much.	Ntabwo numvise cyane.
I know he can do it.	Nzi ko ashobora kubikora.
You know what happened.	Uzi uko byagenze.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
What he told me.	Ibyo yambwiye.
It was very close to him.	Byari hafi cyane kuri we.
Since then, it has been me and me.	Kuva icyo gihe, ni njye na njye.
There is something here.	Hano hari ikintu.
But none of that.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
I think each of us can do that.	Ntekereza ko buri wese muri twe ashobora kubikora.
Really good.	Mubyukuri neza.
Tell me where he is.	Mbwira aho ari.
He needed a little time.	Yari akeneye umwanya muto.
That's what he meant.	Ibyo ni byo yashakaga kuvuga.
I’m sure it’s the same all the time.	Nzi neza ko ari kimwe buri gihe.
You got what you want.	Wabonye icyo ushaka.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He became very human.	Yaje kuba umuntu cyane.
The meeting was not going well.	Inama ntiyari kugenda neza.
No one has ever done anything.	Nta muntu wigeze akora ikintu.
You don't have to be.	Ntugomba kuba.
He can be anyone.	Ashobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He had none of it.	Muri byo nta na kimwe yari afite.
It's the same with everything.	Ni kimwe no kuri byose.
But tell me.	Ariko mbwira.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo rwose, ariko ntabwo aribyo ushaka kuvuga.
But what he told me was not true.	Ariko ibyo yambwiye ntabwo byari ukuri.
He knew everything.	Ibyo yari azi byose.
He did not want to hear this.	Ntiyashakaga kumva ibi.
She was the only woman.	Yari umugore wenyine.
There is truth in truth.	Hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
I have a lot of that.	Mfite byinshi muri byo.
And, after all, you do well.	Kandi, nyuma ya byose, ukora neza.
They were far away.	Bari kure.
He went to eat.	Yagiye kurya.
They have one son.	Bafite umuhungu umwe.
Yes, you can understand why.	Nibyo, urashobora kumva impamvu.
I like to be alone.	Nkunda kuba wenyine.
Many are scared.	Benshi bafite ubwoba.
But this is really the case.	Ariko ibi mubyukuri.
He knew he had nothing to say.	Yari azi ko ntacyo yari kuvuga.
But he knew he had to eat.	Ariko yari azi ko agomba kurya.
I don't think there is much you can do.	Ntekereza ko nta kintu kinini ushobora gukora.
I understand why he did it.	Ndumva impamvu yabikoze.
That was my wife.	Uwo yari umugore wanjye.
That, that.	Uwo, uwo.
I am one person.	Ndi umuntu umwe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
We are many.	Turi benshi.
We also had money.	Natwe twari dufite amafaranga.
Everything has been normal since.	Ibintu byose kuva byari bisanzwe.
She was so nice and nice with me.	Yari mwiza cyane kandi neza hamwe nanjye.
She should be home soon.	Agomba kuba murugo vuba.
He looks young.	Asa naho ari muto.
I'm doing something wrong.	Nkora ikintu kibi.
He had not gone.	Ntabwo yari yagiye.
Na se.	Na se.
He was ready to think.	Yari yiteguye gutekereza.
It's good, it's good.	Ni mwiza, ni byiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
I have never heard of such a thing.	Sinigeze numva ikintu kibi.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
He was not a bad person.	Ntiyari umuntu mubi.
She is the best.	Ni we mwiza cyane.
He had an idea.	Yari afite igitekerezo.
I hope someone can help.	Nizere ko umuntu ashobora gufasha.
He did not want to think or speak.	Ntiyashakaga gutekereza cyangwa kuvuga.
That's fine with you.	Nibyiza nawe.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
I don’t think he saw many.	Ntabwo mbona ko yabonye benshi.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko atari byo.
It was good to drive.	Byari byiza gutwara.
But that is true.	Ariko ibyo ni ukuri.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hariho ikindi kintu gito.
It was really nice to wait.	Byari byiza rwose gutegereza.
I would not return.	Sinari gutaha.
I don't think that's true.	Ntekereza ko ibyo atari ukuri.
She likes to have sex.	Akunda kubana.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He got what he wanted.	Yabonye icyo yashakaga.
I guess it’s all a matter of looking.	Ndakeka ko byose ari ikibazo cyo kureba.
I hope you can do it right.	Nizere ko ushobora kubikora neza.
I had everything and everything was not enough.	Nari mfite byose kandi byose ntabwo byari bihagije.
It's something, it's everything.	Ni ikintu, ni byose.
He can't walk or stay.	Ntashobora kugenda cyangwa kuguma.
All in all.	Byose kuri byose.
He was still very far away.	Yari akiri kure cyane.
I need to stop this.	Nkeneye guhagarika ibi.
No purchases at the moment.	Nta kugura muri iki gihe.
He seemed worried.	Yasaga naho afite impungenge.
He was one young man.	Uwo yari umusore umwe.
The truth.	Ukuri.
Walking was something else.	Kugenda byari ikindi kintu.
It was better than ever.	Byari byiza kurenza ikindi gihe.
But he was there.	Ariko yari ahari.
I am one.	Ndi umwe.
It was his home gift.	Yari impano ye yo murugo.
But that was good for me.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza kuri njye.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
He did not know what it was.	Ntiyari azi icyo aricyo.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
It's just a job.	Ni akazi gusa.
He has to go back.	Agomba gusubira inyuma.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
She feels good.	Yumva ari mwiza.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
She is a very beautiful girl.	Ni umukobwa mwiza cyane.
If so, who do you like?	Niba aribyo, ninde ukunda?.
Maybe this, well.	Ahari ibi, neza.
And all that for me.	Kandi ibyo byose kuri njye.
And this one was not one.	Kandi uyu ntiyari umwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Are you playing ?.	Urimo gukina?.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
He also thought he understood why.	Yatekereje kandi ko yumva impamvu.
I had the same problem.	Nanjye nari mfite iki kibazo.
He looked bad.	Yasaga naho ari mubi.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hafi wenyine.
He says he doesn't want to have any more problems.	Avuga ko adashaka kongera kugira ibibazo.
Work outside.	Akazi hanze.
He was young.	Yari muto.
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.
That is certainly true of us.	Ibyo rwose ni ukuri kuri twe.
Anytime.	Igihe ni cyose.
But he too.	Ariko na we.
It was a thing.	Byari ibintu.
He looked over the phone.	Yarebye hejuru ya terefone.
Someone to see.	Umuntu kubona.
He knows he has to.	Azi ko agomba kugira.
You can never find something to say.	Ntushobora na rimwe gushaka ikintu cyo kuvuga.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Good things were ahead of him.	Ibintu byiza byari imbere ye.
Here it is.	Hano hari.
He really came.	Yaje rwose.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
This is what we need.	Ibi nibyo dukeneye.
And you really can't.	Kandi ntushobora rwose.
I am first.	Ndi mbere.
I can't say enough.	Sinshobora kuvuga bihagije.
The dog is cute.	Imbwa ni nziza.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
It really looks like.	Birasa rwose.
They know nothing about me.	Ntacyo bazi kuri njye.
Very close.	Hafi cyane.
It's like a prison.	Ni nka gereza.
He was not alone in that.	Ntabwo yari wenyine muri ibyo.
That's all.	Bose ni.
I thought that.	Natekereje ko.
And it's a job.	Kandi ni akazi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
There is a woman here.	Hano hari umugore.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
All of this is true.	Ibyo byose ni ukuri.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
It's bad.	Ari mubi.
If there was anything he could do.	Niba hari icyo yashoboraga gukora.
They knew his father.	Bari bazi se.
But he knew what to do.	Ariko yari azi icyo gukora.
We were going well.	Twari kugenda neza.
He is really the only one here.	Ari wenyine rwose hano.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
It's better than what we had.	Nibyiza kuruta ibyo twari dufite.
And he didn't do it on his own.	Kandi ntabwo yabikoze wenyine.
It was really good for us.	Byari byiza rwose kuri twe.
He chose to be.	Yahisemo ko ari.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko aribyo.
Regular reading and study.	Gusoma no kwiga buri gihe.
I didn't have this problem until yesterday.	Ntabwo nagize iki kibazo kugeza ejo.
Being here today.	Kuba uri hano muri iki gihe.
Or, or, or.	Cyangwa, cyangwa, cyangwa.
For a long time he said nothing.	Mu gihe kirekire ntacyo yavuze.
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
We can't go back to where we are.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma aho turi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He can live.	Ashobora kubaho.
He knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi.
No one was there.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kuri yo.
I never saw that.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo.
I was young.	Nari muto.
I was the only one.	Nari njye, ni njye wenyine.
He went for a while.	Yagiye mu gihe gito.
He would definitely come.	Yari kuza rwose.
He is not ready.	Ntabwo yiteguye.
Eventually, he decided to take action.	Amaherezo, yahisemo kugira icyo akora.
You would do a lot.	Wari gukora byinshi.
He told me.	Yambwiye.
He is trying to be far away.	Arimo kugerageza kuba kure.
He was right, and he meant it.	Yavuze ukuri, kandi arashaka kuvuga.
Maybe something else.	Birashoboka ikindi kintu.
It’s not just a party.	Ntabwo ari ibirori gusa.
You can go as fast as you can.	Urashobora kugenda vuba bishoboka.
He enjoyed everything.	Yishimiye ibintu byose.
If any.	Niba hari.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
I mean let it go.	Ndashaka kuvuga reka reka.
But there is nothing to eat there.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe cyo kurya aho.
He didn't want to buy anything he wanted.	Ntabwo yashakaga kugura ibyo ushaka byose.
Maybe in the movie.	Ahari muri firime.
It seems like sometimes.	Birasa nkaho rimwe na rimwe.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
It is nice and easy to hair.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye umusatsi.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
He can win.	Ashobora gutsinda.
You can drive.	Urashobora gutwara.
He had been here for a very long time.	Yari amaze hano igihe kinini cyane.
When he was in prison, he looked inside him.	Igihe yari muri gereza, yarebye imbere muri we.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
I never liked this.	Sinigeze nkunda ibi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
To him or to me.	Kuri we cyangwa kuri njye.
One may have to walk.	Umuntu birashoboka ko agomba kugenda.
He may have a vision problem.	Birashoboka ko afite ikibazo cyo kubona.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
He was young like me.	Yari muto nkanjye.
Inside.	Imbere.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
I should have been more.	Nari nkwiye kuba byinshi.
It was great here.	Byari byiza cyane hano.
He wanted to hear things too.	Yashakaga ko na we yumva ibintu.
Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.
But you may be right.	Ariko urashobora kuba ufite ukuri.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
I love my family.	Nkunda umuryango wanjye.
It's not a small thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu gito.
I love my time.	Nkunda umwanya wanjye.
This is my house now.	Ubu ni inzu yanjye.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
They have nothing to do.	Nta kintu na kimwe bafite cyo gukora.
But he is not sure if he is alone.	Ariko ntabwo azi neza ko ari wenyine.
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
There is something wonderful here.	Hano hari byiza cyane.
But for him.	Ariko kuri yo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But he was still a child.	Ariko ntiyari akiri umwana.
I didn't see that.	Ntabwo nabonye uko.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
He is now.	Ubu ari.
Everything we have.	Ibyo dufite byose.
I want to talk to him.	Ndashaka kuvugana na we.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
You saw the car.	Wabonye imodoka.
To go	Kugenda.
And that is not difficult.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo bigoye.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
I work almost every day.	Nkora hafi buri munsi.
I'm just going to stop living.	Gusa ngiye kureka kubaho.
But a little.	Ariko gato.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He looked down at the money.	Yarebye hasi amafaranga.
He is the only one.	Niwe wenyine.
Eventually the woman had gone outside.	Amaherezo umugore yari yagiye hanze.
The people he chose.	Abantu yahisemo.
It's a good thing he did.	Ni ikintu cyiza yakoze.
In his room.	Mu cyumba cye.
We have faith.	Dufite kwizera.
This is a good idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Nothing for me.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri njye.
He likes to talk.	Akunda kuvuga.
We can't talk here.	Ntidushobora kuvuga hano.
He had to do something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo akora.
But he was still very good.	Ariko yari akiri mwiza cyane.
John's family now.	Umuryango wa John ubu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He never thought of what he wanted.	Ntiyigeze atekereza kubyo ashaka.
But in reality, people.	Ariko mubyukuri, abantu.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
He can see.	Arashobora kubona.
I have to leave.	Ngomba kuva aho.
He just wanted a little something.	Yashakaga gusa ikintu gito.
Eating and drinking a lot.	Kurya no kunywa byinshi.
He can't talk to her.	Ntashobora kuvugana na we.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi ikindi avuga.
Nothing here.	Nta kintu na kimwe hano.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I got the chance.	Nabonye umwanya.
He heard nothing.	Nta cyo yumvise.
I don't know why.	Ntabwo nzi impamvu ibi.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
He could not have what he wanted.	Ibyo yashakaga ntabwo yashoboraga kugira.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
She thought she was so beautiful.	Yatekerezaga ko ari mwiza cyane.
In fact, that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Mubyukuri, ibi nibyo.
You can do it then.	Urashobora kubikora icyo gihe.
However, this is good.	Ariko, ibi nibyiza.
Probably not inside.	Birashoboka ko atari imbere.
Does anyone have any ideas on this?	Hari umuntu ufite igitekerezo kuri ibi?
You can't know when.	Ntushobora kumenya igihe.
She went home to take her children.	Yagiye murugo gufata abana be.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I hope you like staying here.	Nizere ko ukunda kuguma hano.
He has nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe ashobora kuvuga.
This is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibi.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
Or maybe me.	Cyangwa ahari njye.
That's right, my wife.	Nibyo, umugore wanjye.
I want this.	Ndashaka ibi.
He did what he knew.	Yakoze ibyo azi.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
Get it all.	Kubona byose.
This was his house.	Iyi yari inzu ye.
Everything that was here would not be so much.	Ibintu byose byari hano ntabwo byari kuba byinshi.
It is beautiful and beautiful.	Ni mwiza kandi mwiza.
You can't leave the house.	Ntushobora kuva mu nzu.
'	'
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
This is not a problem.	Iki si ikibazo.
He got a job.	Yabonye akazi.
One has to know something.	Umuntu agomba kumenya ikintu.
He said he was not.	Yavuze ko atari we.
I want to say more.	Ndashaka kuvuga byinshi.
I have no plans.	Nta gahunda mfite.
He will be there.	Azaba ahari.
'	'
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
You can't have much.	Ntushobora kugira byinshi.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
And he saw nothing.	Kandi nta kintu yabonye.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
He walks away in awe.	Agenda agira ubwoba.
Very good.	Byiza cyane .
I did something.	Hari icyo nakoze.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo birasa.
We have work to do here.	Dufite akazi ko gukora hano.
That is not true.	Ko atari ukuri.
This is very clear.	Ibi biragaragara cyane.
Tomorrow will be better.	Ejo bizaba byiza.
One, he could not exist.	Umwe, ntabwo yashoboraga kubaho.
I think this is good.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe na we niba aribyo.
I want this.	Ndashaka ibi.
Where you are the only woman you want.	Aho uri umugore wenyine yifuza.
He could have.	Yashoboraga kugira.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
But there is more here.	Ariko hano hari byinshi.
Monday is not good for me.	Ku wa mbere ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
In all, it looks good.	Muri byose, birasa neza.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
It's nothing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu na kimwe.
He just went.	Yagiye gusa.
He knows what it is.	Azi icyo aricyo.
The food was excellent.	Ibiryo byari byiza cyane.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo byose.
I really saw it.	Nabonye rwose.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
He is going to eat everyone.	Agiye kurya abantu bose.
Anxiety.	Kugira impungenge.
This was really good.	Ibi byari byiza rwose.
The reasons are many.	Impamvu ni nyinshi.
He had none.	Nta n'umwe yari afite.
If anything, it was great.	Niba hari ikintu, yari mwiza cyane.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
He is not sure what he is looking for.	Ntabwo azi neza icyo arimo gushaka.
That's not a problem for him.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri we.
How can you be good.	Nigute ushobora kuba mwiza.
It looks bad to me.	Birasa nabi kuri njye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We have to have one or the other.	Tugomba kugira kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
It is good and simple and good.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye hamwe nibyiza.
Recently.	Vuba aha.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
Apparently it was good.	Biragaragara ko byari byiza.
She is confident that she is a young girl.	Yizeye neza ko ari umukobwa muto.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
How to make a movie.	Uburyo bwo gukora firime.
Probably something else.	Birashoboka ko ari ikindi kintu.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo ari cyo.
One is good.	Umwe agira neza.
He just did what he wanted to do.	Yakoze gusa ibyo yashakaga gukora.
Your house is beautiful.	Inzu yawe ni nziza.
It's good that it's not too far away.	Nibyiza ko atari kure cyane.
There is a lot of food.	Hariho ibiryo byinshi.
I did not know.	Sinari nzi.
I'm not bad.	Ntabwo ndi mubi.
Almost so easy.	Hafi byoroshye cyane.
He did it.	Ni we wabikoze.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
I had a problem.	Nari mfite ikibazo.
He wants to think badly of me.	Arashaka gutekereza nabi kuri njye.
Most people are.	Abantu benshi ni.
They have a problem with survival.	Bafite ikibazo cyo kubaho.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
And you are lucky.	Kandi ufite amahirwe.
Eat all day.	Kurya umunsi wose.
And he was.	Kandi yari arimo.
He would eventually give up.	Amaherezo yari kureka.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
It's not a job.	Ntabwo ari akazi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe ari amakosa ye.
You really need to learn to be alone.	Ukeneye rwose kwiga kuba wenyine wenyine.
You don’t know exactly what, exactly.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo, neza.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu.
Absolute care.	Gufata neza rwose.
He says nothing in a short time.	Ntacyo avuga mugihe gito.
I have a problem with that.	Mfite ikibazo kuri ibyo.
There is one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe.
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
It would be better at home.	Byaba byiza murugo.
Really good thing.	Nukuri ikintu cyiza.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo byari ukuri.
I was just your age.	Nari imyaka yawe gusa.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
It's not too far from here.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane ya hano.
I don’t want him to go, either.	Sinshaka ko agenda, cyangwa.
I am very happy to do so.	Nishimiye cyane kubikora.
Here, let's.	Hano, reka.
Maybe we are.	Birashoboka ko turi.
None of us.	Nta n'umwe muri twe.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
But we had nothing to do with it.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe twari dufite cyo kubikora.
Especially not children.	Cyane cyane ntabwo ari abana.
We have too.	Natwe dufite.
How? 	Nigute?
No one is in the room.	Nta muntu uri mu cyumba.
He walks forward.	Agenda imbere.
He didn't want to come.	Ntiyashakaga kuza.
Formerly, as a child.	Yahoze, akiri umwana.
Today I found a friend.	Uyu munsi nabonye inshuti.
You don't.	Ntabwo ukora.
He never said it was easy.	Ntiyigeze avuga ko byoroshye.
But this really looks bad.	Ariko ibi mubyukuri birasa nabi.
Tonight it would be nice.	Iri joro byaba byiza.
But you have to work.	Ariko ugomba gukora.
The dog was scared.	Imbwa yagize ubwoba.
Everything would be drunk.	Ibintu byose byari kunywa.
It's good, it's good, it's good.	Nibyiza, byiza, byiza.
At home, not below.	Murugo, ntabwo ari munsi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo gihe icyo gihe.
He went downstairs.	Yagiye hasi hasi.
I never thought he had taken anything.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko hari icyo yafashe.
And he had thought of a book.	Kandi yari yatekereje igitabo.
Back, back, back.	Inyuma, inyuma, inyuma.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo yari afite.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
Everyone knew it was bad.	Abantu bose bari bazi ko ari mubi.
He had no gifts.	Ntabwo yari afite impano.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That was absolutely possible.	Ibyo byari bishoboka rwose.
But that is not all.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo rwose.
What do we have here? 	Dufite iki hano?
He knows he has to.	Azi ko agomba.
Now everyone is here.	Ubu abantu bose bari hano.
It's on schedule.	Ni kuri gahunda.
She will be very beautiful.	Azaba mwiza cyane.
To.	Kuri.
She was just a woman.	Yari umugore gusa.
I don’t think of being human.	Ntabwo ntekereza kuba umuntu.
You can't give up that time.	Ntushobora kureka icyo gihe.
I am so happy to be with you today.	Nishimiye cyane kubana nawe uyu munsi.
With him, I'm sure.	We hamwe nawe, nzi neza ko.
Having a daughter.	Kugira umukobwa.
Glad to have you.	Nishimiye kuba ufite.
There is your money.	Hariho amafaranga yawe.
It was great to be together again.	Byari byiza cyane kongera kubana.
He has a party.	Afite ibirori.
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
That's right.	Nukuri.
He is now close.	Ubu ari hafi.
I need a drink.	Nkeneye kunywa.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka gato.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I am here every night.	Ndi hano buri joro.
And he is right about that.	Kandi afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
But he thought he was very good.	Ariko yatekereje ko yari mwiza cyane.
There is a little girl.	Hariho umukobwa muto.
However, that is not what he does.	Ariko, ibyo ntabwo aribyo akora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byoroshye bihagije.
Or, maybe, a little bit.	Cyangwa, ahari, gato gato.
I never thought.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza.
He has something to do.	Afite icyo akora.
Or you, obviously.	Cyangwa wowe, biragaragara.
They were really good friends.	Bari inshuti nziza rwose.
He is your age.	Afite imyaka yawe.
He really wanted to be at work.	Yashakaga rwose kuba mu kazi.
I feel the same way about you.	Ndumva ari kimwe nawe.
I think this is a good idea.	Ntekereza ko iki ari igitekerezo cyiza.
I found his place.	Nabonye umwanya we.
He said well, that's fine.	Yavuze neza, ni byiza.
He doesn't need my money.	Ntabwo akeneye amafaranga yanjye.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's too high to be there.	Ni hejuru cyane kuba ahari.
One always wants more.	Umuntu ahora ashaka byinshi.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza na gato.
He’s just a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza gusa.
But here you have to be.	Ariko hano ugomba kuba.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
It wasn't his fault, it wasn't really.	Ntabwo yari amakosa ye, ntabwo mubyukuri.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
There is more, though.	Hariho byinshi ariko.
In all he has now.	Muri byose afite ubu.
He had no hope.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yizeye.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Either way, what are you going to do.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ugiye gukora iki.
It was easy before.	Byari byoroshye mbere.
I don't really like this.	Ntabwo nkunda ibi rwose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I am very happy for everyone.	Nishimiye cyane bose.
Today, it was not a bad day.	Uyu munsi, ntabwo wari umunsi mubi.
I enjoyed reading.	Nishimiye gusoma.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byo, birashoboka ko atari byo.
It's good for one.	Nibyiza kuri kimwe kimwe.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari azi.
But he can't drive.	Ariko ntashobora gutwara.
At the moment it is.	Kuri ubu ni.
He said he was not the only one.	Yavuze ko atari we wenyine.
I can only do that.	Nshobora kubikora gusa.
He wanted to be a good boy.	Yashakaga kuba umuhungu mwiza.
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
It was his favorite food.	Yari ibiryo yakundaga cyane.
I guess he should.	Ndakeka ko agomba.
I don't know if we should be.	Sinzi ko tugomba kuba.
I have a dog.	Mfite imbwa.
This is a beautiful house.	Iyi ni inzu nziza.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
Being a smart player.	Kuba umukinnyi uzi ubwenge.
You always have problems.	Buri gihe ufite ibibazo.
I can't find it here.	Sinshobora kubona hano.
You knew nothing about that world.	Ntacyo wari uzi kuri iyo si.
I am so happy to be here.	Nishimiye cyane kuba hano.
Not really the same thing.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikintu kimwe.
He thought back.	Yatekereje inyuma.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I am a very bad person.	Ndi umuntu mubi cyane.
It could have been, but it is not.	Yashoboraga kuba, ariko sibyo.
They now have children.	Ubu bafite abana.
It was a learning process.	Byari gahunda yo kwiga.
He is a really good guy.	Ni umusore mwiza rwose.
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.
More than playing and less playing.	Kurenza gukina no munsi yo gukina.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
To see	Kureba.
Well, good enough.	Nibyiza, nibyiza bihagije.
I never saw him scared before.	Sinigeze mbona afite ubwoba mbere.
There is nothing you need to do.	Nta kintu ukeneye gukora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I am currently in prison.	Ubu ndi muri gereza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
What they were.	Icyo bari cyo.
I know it happened.	Nzi ko byagenze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, yari azi impamvu yari hano.
Children.	Abana .
I'm doing well.	Ndimo gukora neza.
And well.	Kandi neza.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
Sometimes, you just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Rimwe na rimwe, ugomba gukora akazi hamwe nibyo wabonye.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
He never felt alone.	Nta na rimwe yigeze yumva ko ari wenyine.
He was probably young.	Birashoboka ko yari muto.
Or maybe not.	Cyangwa birashoboka, ntabwo aribyo.
But there is one thing you need to know.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe ugomba kumenya.
If not, he knew where he was going.	Niba atari byo, yamenye aho yagiye.
You can be.	Urashobora kuba.
He had to do something.	Yagombaga kugira icyo akora.
I have many friends.	Mfite inshuti nyinshi.
This is all we need.	Ibi nibyo dukeneye byose.
I would do it.	Nari kubikora.
He didn't want to take anything.	Ntiyashakaga gufata ikintu na kimwe.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
You can't wait.	Ntushobora gutegereza.
He didn't tell me anything.	Nta na kimwe yambwiye.
He did not want to leave his room.	Ntiyashakaga kuva mu cyumba cye.
But you always have to be careful.	Ariko buri gihe ugomba kureba neza.
He thought they were here.	Yatekereje ko bari hano.
For now, we just need to get the job done.	Kuri ubu, dukeneye gukora akazi gusa.
We are far away.	Turi kure cyane.
They are in the movie.	Bari muri firime.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
But to ask.	Ariko gusaba.
I don't know who.	Sinzi uwo.
He walks away without it.	Agenda kure adafite.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
That's good for me.	Ibyo ni byiza kuri njye.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
She was not a young girl.	Ntabwo yari umukobwa muto.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
If so, it worked.	Niba aribyo, byagenze neza.
I see it as a gift.	Mbona ko ari impano.
But we can't do that.	Ariko ntidushobora kubikora.
He wanted to help people.	Yashakaga gufasha abantu.
I just want to be friends.	Ndashaka kuba inshuti gusa.
That's all there is to it.	Nibyo gusa ibyo umuntu akora.
Nothing for me.	Ntacyo kuri njye.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
He can be really good.	Arashobora kuba mwiza rwose.
And they would do nothing.	Kandi ntacyo bari gukora.
As long as he was close to her.	Igihe cyose yari hafi ye.
One more thing.	Ikindi kintu kimwe.
Working together.	Gukora hamwe.
He said he was.	Yavuze ko ari.
He chose.	Yahisemo.
Up and up.	Hejuru kandi hejuru.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I would live.	Nari kubaho.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
He didn't expect it, not now.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ko, atari ubu.
It wasn’t really a good thing.	Ntabwo rwose byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
You can definitely have everything.	Urashobora rwose kugira byose.
Alone and alone.	Wenyine kandi wenyine.
We have so many.	Dufite benshi cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He must be, for what he bought.	Agomba kuba, kubyo yaguze.
For me.	Kuri njye.
How is that possible?!.	Nigute ibyo bishoboka?!.
I wanted that especially.	Nashakaga ko cyane cyane.
But not for long.	Ariko si igihe kirekire.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He said he would do it.	Yavuze ko azabikora.
He would not say what it was.	Ntabwo yari kuvuga icyo aricyo.
We have so many.	Dufite benshi cyane.
Just me	Ndi njye gusa.
I have to help.	Ngomba gufasha.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
As it was a family.	Nkuko byari umuryango.
This one was supposed to be his.	Uyu yagombaga kuba we.
This is obviously not good.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari byiza.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I had the opportunity to have more.	Nagize amahirwe yo kugira byinshi.
I was scared of him outside.	Nagize ubwoba kuri we hanze.
I was very young at the time.	Icyo gihe nari muto cyane.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
And that is true of many things.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri kuri byinshi.
Nothing.	Nta kintu kimwe.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
He was not.	Ntiyari.
I had no problem.	Ntabwo nagize ikibazo.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I'm not scared.	Ntabwo mfite ubwoba.
This is why.	Iyi ni impamvu.
If not, it is not.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo.
He loved who he was.	Yakundaga uwo ari we.
I'm happy.	Nishimiye.
But simple is not always good.	Ariko byoroshye ntabwo buri gihe ari byiza.
You were right.	Wari ukuri.
Not this morning.	Ntabwo ari muri iki gitondo.
We need to know what it is.	Tugomba kumenya icyo aricyo.
You saw it tonight.	Wabonye iri joro.
Stop doing it.	Reka kubikora.
You were going to say a lot.	Wari ugiye kuvuga byinshi.
There is a small problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo gito.
We have to play well from here on out.	Tugomba gukina neza kuva hano.
You are not far away and alone.	Ntabwo uri kure cyane kandi wenyine.
It's not just here.	Ntabwo ari hano gusa.
What we needed.	Ibyo twari dukeneye.
None of us do, maybe.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ukora, birashoboka.
The one he came to marry.	Uwo yaje gushaka.
I have no problem doing that.	Nta kibazo mfite cyo kubikora.
He can't see anything.	Ntashobora kubona ikintu na kimwe.
We have a lot.	Dufite byinshi.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
And once he was at work.	Kandi rimwe yari ku kazi.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
Of course, he wouldn't do it.	Nibyo, ntabwo yari kubikora.
I was looking for a job.	Nashakaga akazi.
You can actually say bad things.	Mubyukuri ushobora kuvuga nabi.
I can't figure out the problem.	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya ikibazo.
I think he is your age.	Ntekereza ko afite imyaka yawe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I can't help it now.	Sinshobora gufasha iki gihe.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu ntabwo ari byiza kugenda.
There is a similar idea.	Hariho igitekerezo kimwe.
As it is.	Nkuko ari.
It's just a chance.	Ni amahirwe gusa.
Your child is.	Umwana wawe ni.
And inside.	Kandi imbere.
I didn’t know what to do or believe.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora cyangwa kwizera.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Why is it low ?.	Kuki ari hasi?.
He said he was scared.	Yavuze ko afite ubwoba.
But only one.	Ariko umwe gusa.
We have to be.	Tugomba kuba.
But it was easy to stay.	Ariko byari byoroshye kuguma.
He is out alone.	Ari hanze wenyine.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I really like coming here.	Nkunda cyane kuza hano.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, reka guhagarika ibi.
He had to take what he could get.	Yagombaga gufata ibyo yashoboraga kubona.
That's not a problem at all.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo na gato.
I love how it happened.	Nkunda uko byagenze.
They were absolutely right.	Bari bafite ukuri rwose.
I never wanted a baby.	Sinigeze nshaka umwana.
It was nice to have her friend.	Byari byiza kugira inshuti ye.
The good thing about me is that.	Ikintu cyiza kuri njye, nibyo.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
I saw that coming a long way.	Nabonye ko kuza kure.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, ntabwo byari ukuri.
All together	Bose hamwe.
I do nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nkora.
His book is very good.	Igitabo cye cyiza cyane.
Being on top is not always a good time.	Kuba hejuru ntabwo buri gihe ari umwanya mwiza.
The guy is beautiful.	Umusore ni mwiza.
Your wife.	Umugore wawe.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
Let it all go.	Reka byose.
And he really meant it.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga rwose.
I was a bad person.	Nari umuntu mubi.
Probably always.	Birashoboka ko buri gihe.
We have to try.	Tugomba kugerageza.
I never thought you would like that.	Sinigeze mbona ko ukunda gutya.
It was harder than that.	Byari bigoye kuruta ibyo.
He was not the first person in the world.	Ntabwo yari umuntu wa mbere kuri iyi si.
I have to have a little time.	Ngomba kugira umwanya muto.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Something to know.	Ikintu cyo kumenya.
But the problem is much bigger.	Ariko ikibazo ni kinini cyane kuruta ibyo.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
But, there is something about it.	Ariko, hariho ikintu kuri yo.
You should never be alone.	Ntugomba na rimwe kuba wenyine.
You have to go now.	Ugomba kugenda ubu.
When you go to see.	Iyo ugiye kubona.
I have a reason.	Mfite impamvu.
You can't see the error.	Ntushobora kubona amakosa.
In fact, he couldn't wait to go.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yashoboraga gutegereza kugenda.
It was good.	Byari byiza .
And not you.	Kandi atari wowe.
That's right.	Ni kuri.
I am eating well.	Ndimo kurya neza.
I'm not here.	Ntabwo ndi hano.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
But it is something.	Ariko ni ikintu.
I have had this problem for a long time.	Nagize iki kibazo igihe kinini.
However, they are close.	Ariko, biragaragara ko bari hafi.
I need to know the truth.	Ngomba kumenya ukuri.
Just trying to help.	Kugerageza gusa gufasha.
I guess he didn't.	Ndakeka ko atabikoze.
No one would know.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kumenya.
All together, a good book.	Bose hamwe, igitabo cyiza.
It was a beautiful day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza cyane.
The thing is.	Ikintu ni.
I was at home.	Nari murugo.
Probably not too far away.	Birashoboka ko atari kure cyane.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
He saw all that.	Yabonye ibyo byose.
This is exactly what he needs.	Ibi nibyo akeneye.
This is someone you need.	Uyu ni umuntu ukeneye.
He was never the first.	Ntiyigeze aba mbere.
We all have.	Twese dufite.
However, there is something else.	Ariko, hariho ikindi kintu.
He saw it above.	Yabonye hejuru.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
He could hear that.	Ibyo yashoboraga kumva.
Especially hearing someone talk loudly.	Cyane cyane kumva umuntu avuga hejuru.
All or nothing.	Byose cyangwa ntacyo.
It’s not a good movie.	Ntabwo ari firime nziza.
That was enough for now.	Ibi byari bihagije kuri ubu.
There is a truth for each of us.	Hariho ukuri kuri buri wese muri twe.
You know what to do.	Uzi icyo gukora.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
Maybe more than you have.	Birashoboka kurenza ibyo ufite.
There is a chance here.	Hano hari amahirwe.
I guess I should have talked better.	Ndakeka ko nari nkwiye kuvugana neza.
There is so much to think about.	Hariho byinshi byo gutekereza.
And he.	Na we.
You were a family.	Wari umuryango.
They weren't his children, obviously.	Ntabwo bari abana be, biragaragara.
He had nothing in him.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite muri we.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
I saw it now, man.	Nabonye ubu, muntu.
However, this is a much bigger problem.	Ariko, iki kibazo kinini cyane kuruta ibyo.
But it is very good.	Ariko nibyiza cyane.
Just being together.	Kuba hamwe gusa.
He did it now.	Yabikoze ubu.
I would like to have a plan.	Ndashaka kubona gahunda.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
Now is the time to wait.	Ubu ni igihe cye cyo gutegereza.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
I can't say enough.	Sinshobora kuvuga bihagije.
He does this all the time.	Ibyo abikora buri gihe.
He seemed to have no idea what to do.	Yasaga naho atazi neza icyo gukora.
No one knew what it was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo aricyo.
It was a small thing, really.	Byari ikintu gito, mubyukuri.
This morning	Muri iki gitondo.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
He looked scared.	Yarebye ubwoba.
That’s not the only thing here.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa hano.
You can't know one of them.	Ntushobora kumenya kimwe muri byo.
But he saw nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
The child deserves the opportunity.	Umwana akwiye amahirwe.
But it’s not just food.	Ariko ntabwo ari ibiryo gusa.
But it will not be tomorrow.	Ariko ntabwo bizaba ejo.
He is not a film actor.	Ntabwo ari umukinnyi wa firime.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
It is my plan.	Ni gahunda yanjye.
For him, alone.	Kuri we, wenyine.
He had no idea where to go now.	Ntabwo yari afite igitekerezo na gito aho agomba kujya ubu.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
I needed bad advice.	Nari nkeneye inama nabi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I was beautiful.	Nari mwiza.
That's all he could take.	Ibyo aribyo byose yashoboraga gufata.
You may think.	Urashobora gutekereza.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
.	.
Good player.	Umukinnyi mwiza.
It is not a good idea in the long run.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza mugihe kirekire.
Go shopping.	Kujya kugura.
She was a woman, but she was not a man.	Yari umugore, ariko ntabwo yari umuntu.
Who is near you?	Ninde uri hafi yawe?
It’s not just a good idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo cyiza gusa.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
He needed to be alone.	Yari akeneye kuba wenyine.
I thought they were right.	Natekereje ko bafite ukuri.
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
.	.
Especially my daughter loves it.	Cyane cyane umukobwa wanjye akunda.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
In fact, it is very good.	Mubyukuri, ni byiza cyane.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
We can't stay.	Ntidushobora kuguma.
If you don’t want to, it’s really good.	Niba udashaka, nibyiza rwose.
You don't have to.	Ntugomba.
I can do nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
Or did he think he should.	Cyangwa yatekereje ko agomba.
They have a lot.	Bafite byinshi.
If not, you need to know what it is.	Niba atari byo, ugomba kumenya icyo aricyo.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
Of course they were here.	Nukuri ko bari hano.
More and more, many more.	Byinshi kandi byinshi, byinshi ni byinshi.
I really like it.	Mubyukuri nkunda.
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
I can help a lot.	Nshobora gufasha byinshi.
I mean, maybe.	Ndashaka kuvuga, birashoboka.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
I'm really worried.	Mfite impungenge rwose.
And that was good.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza.
He wanted to see that.	Yashakaga kubona ibyo.
I thought you were one of us.	Natekereje ko uri umwe muri twe.
He must see and hear.	Agomba kubona no kumva.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You can't eat everything.	Ntushobora kurya byose.
.	.
But he would not do it tonight.	Ariko ntabwo yari kubikora muri iri joro.
She was as beautiful as ever.	Yari mwiza nka mbere.
You don't even have to try to do that.	Ntagomba no kugerageza kubikora.
And another little thing,.	Kandi ikindi kintu gito ,.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Gusa ugomba kureba cyane.
Here you are.	Hano uri.
He could read.	Yashoboraga gusoma.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
They would all cease to exist.	Bose bari kureka kubaho.
But he is right.	Ariko afite ukuri.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hari byinshi.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda.
A woman can be anyone.	Umugore ashobora kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I like to eat well.	Nkunda kurya neza.
I saw it all.	Nabonye byose.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He can walk a little.	Arashobora kugenda gato.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
Anyone could do that.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga kubikora.
Not good but working.	Ntabwo ari mwiza ariko ukora.
I want to know what it is.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo aricyo.
I hope there are more people like me.	Nizera ko hari abantu benshi nkanjye.
It was great, really good.	Byari byiza, byiza rwose.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
It was a party.	Byari ibirori.
You don’t have to think too much.	Ntugomba gutekereza cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari amaze kubikora.
We are your family.	Turi umuryango wawe.
Everything he saw.	Ibintu byose yabonye.
People are here.	Abantu bari hano.
You should not think so.	Ntugomba gutekereza ko aribyo.
Or very close.	Cyangwa hafi cyane.
No one has anything for him.	Nta muntu ufite ikintu kuri we.
Everything was very good or good.	Byose byari byiza cyane cyangwa byiza.
No one, no one, no one.	Nta n'umwe, nta n'umwe, nta n'umwe.
And that you are in it.	Kandi ko uri muri byo.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
You can't tell what it is.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo aricyo.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
But you know something.	Ariko hari icyo uzi.
There is a lot to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kwiga.
Quit.	Kureka.
Really good question.	Ikibazo cyiza rwose.
It was his house.	Yari inzu ye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo yari.
I didn't know how to do it.	Sinari nzi gukora.
In fact, it was.	Mu kuri, ni ko yari.
He is doing very badly.	Akora nabi cyane.
He did it.	Ni we wabikoze.
I feel good.	Numva ari byiza.
None of them.	Nta n'umwe muri we.
He was the same.	Na we ni ko yari.
He can go.	Arashobora kugenda.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
He can study.	Arashobora kwiga.
I have the same idea.	Mfite igitekerezo kimwe.
It's a party.	Ni ibirori.
I'm close, after all.	Ndi hafi, nyuma ya byose.
He needed that.	Yari akeneye ibyo.
He did it that morning.	Yabikoze muri icyo gitondo.
Just not that much.	Gusa ntabwo aribyo byinshi.
If not more.	Niba atari byinshi.
He was looking for a car.	Yashakaga imodoka.
She is really scared.	Nukuri afite ubwoba.
He is a very good friend.	Ni inshuti nziza cyane.
Please.	Nyamuneka.
I have never seen anything better.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona ikintu cyiza.
Simpler is better than harder.	Byoroshye nibyiza kuruta bigoye.
Or feel that you are on the ground.	Cyangwa kumva ko uri hasi.
He had enough.	Yari afite bihagije.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
We have a lot of problems.	Dufite ibibazo byinshi.
We were bad.	Twari mubi.
He was not worried.	Ntabwo yari afite impungenge.
But you.	Ariko wowe.
But that is not the case.	Ariko si byo.
I don't know many people here.	Sinzi abantu benshi hano.
Only sometimes you can’t.	Gusa rimwe na rimwe ntushobora.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
Quit.	Kureka.
Everyone has problems.	Umuntu wese afite ibibazo.
That's right, you have to go.	Nibyo, ugomba kugenda.
I am the only one now.	Ubu ni njye gusa.
I never saw that.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
You have to take all your hair.	Ugomba gufata umusatsi wawe wose.
John there.	Yohana aho.
I was on one recently.	Nari kuri umwe vuba aha.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
He was an expert in school play.	Yari umuhanga mu gukina ishuri.
In fact he had done nothing.	Mubyukuri ntacyo yari yakoze.
I need to stop coming here.	Nkeneye guhagarika kuza hano.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
It's not close.	Ntabwo ari hafi.
They would both do it.	Bombi bari kubikora.
They weren't there before.	Ntabwo bari mbere.
She is not a woman you should talk to.	Ntabwo ari umugore ukwiye kuvugana nawe.
Faith is a gift.	Kwizera ni impano.
He never had one of those.	Ntabwo yigeze agira kimwe muri ibyo.
'	'
He didn’t do much.	Ntabwo yakoze cyane.
This is true.	Ubu ni ukuri.
All you have to do is believe.	Ukeneye kwizera gusa.
There is a reason.	Hariho impamvu.
It was very childish.	Byari umwana cyane.
I don't know why they would do that.	Sinzi impamvu bari kubikora.
It would be useless.	Yaba ntacyo amaze.
I'm scared to think.	Mfite ubwoba bwo gutekereza.
He was good, he was not good.	Yari mwiza, ntabwo yari mwiza.
He had only one.	Yari afite umwe gusa.
I'm not ashamed	Ntabwo mfite isoni.
He was just happy to be there.	Yishimiye gusa kuba ahari.
He wants to take the car.	Arashaka gufata imodoka.
I can't ask for this much.	Ntabwo nshobora gusaba iyi cyane bihagije.
You have a friend.	Ufite inshuti.
You don't have to stay here.	Ntagomba kuguma hano.
My wife is scared.	Umugore wanjye agira ubwoba.
That's all we have here, problems.	Nibyo byose dufite hafi hano, ibibazo.
But one thing is for sure.	Ariko ikintu kimwe rwose.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba ari byiza.
I know there is.	Nzi ko hariho.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira byinshi.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
The truth.	Ukuri.
And he has.	Kandi afite.
Take a good look.	Kureba neza.
But please.	Ariko nyamuneka.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I don't have to.	Ntabwo ngomba.
But they are worried.	Ariko bafite impungenge.
Good reason.	Impamvu nziza.
That's good.	Ibyo nibyiza.
What he liked.	Icyo yakundaga.
Not much, but it would be nice.	Ntabwo ari byinshi, ariko byaba byiza.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
You are not at fault.	Ntabwo ufite amakosa rwose.
I know there is.	Nzi ko hariho.
Anyone could have taken that.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese yashoboraga gufata ibyo.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
At the time, he was not scared or scared.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yari afite ubwoba cyangwa ubwoba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
When he was alone.	Igihe yari we wenyine.
He thought that maybe every house came that way.	Yatekereje ko ahari buri nzu yaje gutya.
You haven't seen the problem before.	Ntabwo wabonye ikibazo mbere.
You are at home.	Uri murugo.
You may want to reconsider.	Urashobora gushaka kongera gutekereza kuri ibi byose.
Absolutely thinking.	Gutekereza rwose.
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
Good things at home.	Ibintu byiza murugo.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
But he will never hear it.	Ariko ntazigera yumva.
We are all human.	Twese turi abantu.
He had a problem.	Yari afite ikibazo.
He did it now.	Yabikoze ubu.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He had it very quickly.	Yari afite vuba vuba.
Maybe it was all my fault.	Birashoboka ko byose byari amakosa yanjye.
Eating good food.	Kurya ibiryo byiza.
I never had to find a job.	Sinigeze ngomba kubona akazi.
He was an expert.	Yari umuhanga.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
Tell me exactly.	Bwira neza.
You don’t have to be scared.	Ntugomba kugira ubwoba.
He is not afraid.	Ntabwo afite ubwoba.
He took issues.	Yafashe ibibazo.
Little boy	Umuhungu muto.
And in the end he chose to do it.	Kandi amaherezo yari yahisemo.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
But, he is right.	Ariko, afite ukuri.
I thought.	Ndatekereza.
I knew that room.	Nari nzi icyo cyumba.
He could feel it in her.	Yashoboraga kumva hafi muri we.
Not just friends.	Ntabwo ari inshuti gusa.
I want to be beautiful.	Ndashaka kuba mwiza.
But I can't go back now.	Ariko ntashobora gusubira inyuma ubu.
Only.	Gusa.
He is the only one for us.	Niwe wenyine kuri twe.
It was not just a matter of time.	Ntabwo byari ikintu gusa.
He was a very good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza cyane.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo rwose, kandi.
But now, you are here.	Ariko ubu, uri hano.
We need to talk to him.	Tugomba kuvugana na we.
But in reality, that is not always the case.	Ariko, mubyukuri, ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
He can't speak.	Ntashobora kuvuga.
I definitely have to go home.	Ngomba rwose gutaha.
I needed people.	Nari nkeneye abantu.
He felt enough.	Yumvise bihagije.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
I am a very good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza cyane.
Things to play.	Ibintu byo gukina.
I never wanted anything.	Sinigeze nshaka ikintu na kimwe.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
Here, in his prison.	Hano, muri gereza ye.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
He doesn't know he's here, he isn't.	Ntabwo azi ko ari hano, ntabwo aribyo.
I can't stay away.	Sinshobora kuguma kure.
He was not going to back down.	Ntabwo yari agiye gusubira inyuma.
Talking and walking.	Kuvuga no kugenda.
That's great for me.	Nibyiza cyane kuri njye.
It's a pleasure to meet you.	Nyamuneka nyamuneka kubona kimwe.
It’s not the best thing to do, either.	Ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza cyane cyo gukora, cyangwa.
And as usual.	Kandi nkuko bisanzwe.
Kandi.	Kandi.
Or maybe he was.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
But most people.	Ariko abantu benshi.
He has good things.	Afite ibintu byiza.
But that’s only if you have the time.	Ariko ibyo aribyo gusa niba ufite umwanya.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He looked very carefully.	Yarebye neza cyane.
He enjoyed it all.	Yishimiye ibyo byose.
A lot of time to think.	Igihe kinini cyo gutekereza.
I would eat soon.	Nari kurya vuba.
Or maybe it's just me.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko ari njye gusa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko umwana yari afite.
Apparently he was looking for someone.	Biragaragara ko yashakaga umuntu.
But that was very easy.	Ariko ibyo byari byoroshye cyane.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
I guess he's human.	Ndakeka ko ari umuntu.
it was good	byari byiza.
He thought he was not at the same time.	Yatekereje ko atari mu gihe kimwe.
I hope so too.	Nizere ko nawe ari.
I'm about to leave.	Ndi hafi yo kugenda.
That would be too much.	Ibyo byaba ari byinshi cyane.
Or almost everything.	Cyangwa hafi ya byose.
Or, it's easy.	Cyangwa, byoroshye.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
It was really scary.	Byari ubwoba rwose.
Everything was fine.	Ibintu byose byari byiza.
He had said what he was saying.	Yari yavuze icyo avuga.
And he did it on his own, while he was at work.	Kandi yabikoze wenyine, mu gihe yari ku kazi.
In fact, it is very low.	Mubyukuri, ni hasi cyane.
Really early.	Nukuri kare kare.
It was hard to go back up.	Byari bigoye gusubira hejuru.
Or maybe it's just me.	Cyangwa ahari njye gusa.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
If he was here.	Niba yari hano.
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
He was a really good kid.	Yari umwana mwiza rwose.
I had a lot in me.	Nari mfite byinshi muri njye.
I was one.	Nari umwe.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
Maybe we can help.	Ahari dushobora gufasha.
You don't want anything here.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushaka hano.
You need to try to be alone.	Ukeneye kugerageza kuba wenyine.
This one is on top.	Iyi iri hejuru.
I can live a lot.	Nshobora kubaho cyane.
I don't know when.	Sinzi igihe.
You have to be very high.	Ugomba kuba uri hejuru cyane.
But he didn’t want to think about that possible.	Ariko ntiyashakaga gutekereza kuri ibyo bishoboka.
I need to do it.	Nkeneye kubikora.
It's something.	Ni ikintu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
This was normal.	Ibi byari ibintu bisanzwe.
You are now a family.	Ubu nawe uri umuryango.
She works at school.	Akora ku ishuri.
He is here.	Ari hano.
She chose to do it herself.	Yahisemo kubikora wenyine.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibyo nibyo rwose.
He is a child.	Ni umwana.
Or maybe clothes.	Cyangwa ahari imyenda.
I can know everything.	Nshobora kumenya byose.
He found that he liked to work.	Yabonye ko akunda gukora.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo gufata.
Who can help.	Ninde ushobora gufasha.
He knew he had to get out of here.	Yari azi ko agomba kuva hano.
Nothing is true.	Nta kintu na kimwe ari ukuri.
But it is very good.	Ariko ni byiza cyane.
That's a good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
That was enough.	Ibyo byari bihagije.
Why is that.	Kuki ibi aribyo.
None of us know anything.	Nta n'umwe muri twe uzi icyo ari cyo cyose.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
He hears everyone.	Yumva abantu bose.
I have my own house.	Mfite inzu yanjye.
I have a child at home.	Mfite umwana murugo.
No one has clothes.	Nta n'umwe ufite imyenda.
He was not alone at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yari wenyine.
You can do a lot of things.	Urashobora gukora ibintu byinshi.
I find it easy for me.	Mbona byoroshye kuri njye.
My friend thinks her house is beautiful.	Inshuti yanjye yibwira ko inzu ye ari nziza.
I want everything.	Ndashaka byose.
He wanted to know everything.	Yashakaga kumenya byose.
Anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese.
Something he said.	Ikintu yavuze.
With	Hamwe na.
What he was going to do on his own.	Icyo yari agiye gukora wenyine.
If you are lucky, there is only one.	Niba ufite amahirwe, hariho umwe gusa.
I am doing as usual.	Ndimo gukora nkuko bisanzwe.
He has a wife.	Afite umugore.
Most people are on schedule all the time.	Abantu benshi muri gahunda igihe cyose.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
I didn't want to.	Ntabwo nashakaga.
In any case, it is.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ni.
It was not his house.	Ntabwo yari inzu ye.
People you know.	Abantu uzi.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I'm not in school.	Ntabwo ndi mu ishuri.
Always small.	Buri gihe ni muto.
He is not a dog.	Ntabwo ari imbwa.
I hope it will.	Ndizera ko bizaba.
I see nothing in it or in it.	Ntacyo mbona muri cyo cyangwa muri cyo.
All day long	Umunsi wose.
He thought you knew something.	Yatekereje ko hari icyo uzi.
I'm going to go back and look for that.	Ngiye gusubira inyuma ndashaka ibyo.
He told me about it.	Yambwiye muri byo.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
They were both scared.	Bombi bari bafite ubwoba.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
One he had.	Umwe yari afite.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
There are some things you need to know.	Hariho ibintu ukeneye kumenya.
It is very good and very good.	Nibyiza kandi byiza cyane.
I saw something else.	Nabonye ikindi kintu.
There is a plan here, but for no reason.	Hano hari gahunda, ariko nta mpamvu.
And he did it very well.	Kandi yabikoze neza cyane.
Someone like me	Umuntu nkanjye.
I thought there was a lot of opportunity.	Natekereje ko hari amahirwe menshi.
And it was all here.	Kandi byose byari hano.
I hope he did too.	Ndizera ko na we yabikoze.
But he also denied the allegations.	Ariko na we yavuze ko atari byo.
He should not be alone.	Ntagomba kuba wenyine.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
There is something he has to do.	Hariho ikintu agomba gukora.
I mean, that's not really the case.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo bigoye.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, bombi bafite ukuri.
She was a beautiful woman.	Yari umugore mwiza.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
You've got enough.	Wabonye bihagije.
It would not work to have.	Ntabwo byari gukora kugira.
You said enough.	Wavuze bihagije.
I knew everything.	Nari nzi byose.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
He has to stay.	Agomba kuguma.
That's not what you think at all.	Ntabwo ari ibyo utekereza na gato.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
In his room.	Mu cyumba cye.
They have a lot.	Bafite byinshi.
That was too much.	Ibyo byari byinshi cyane.
He hadn't looked far.	Ntabwo yari yarebye kure.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
All in all a wonderful and wonderful gift.	Byose muri byose impano nziza kandi nziza.
You can read that again.	Urashobora kongera gusoma ibyo.
I think we should all do that.	Ndatekereza ko twese tugomba kubikora.
He wanted to go as fast as possible.	Yashakaga kugenda vuba bishoboka.
He heard her walk upstairs.	Yumvise kugenda hejuru.
From above, he could see everything.	Kuva hejuru, yashoboraga kubona byose.
But here, you can.	Ariko hano, urashobora.
You were human.	Wari umuntu.
Family my son.	Umuryango umuhungu wanjye.
That's the whole point.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyose.
You can tell.	Urashobora kuvuga.
It was not just a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo gusa.
And that was true.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri.
That is not a problem for us.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri twe.
The child may need to study.	Umwana arashobora kuba akwiye kwiga.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I was very close.	Nari hafi cyane.
He was a dog.	Yari imbwa.
But he can't stay.	Ariko ntashobora kuguma.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
That was true at the time.	Icyo gihe byari ukuri.
Either way, you know what it is.	Ibyo ari byo byose, uzi icyo aricyo.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
That will be enough.	Ibyo bizaba bihagije.
Only.	Gusa.
You are very sensitive.	Urimo kumva cyane.
He was a very nice guy to be around.	Yari umusore mwiza cyane kugira hafi.
He did.	Yabikoze.
We are a family.	Turi umuryango.
We have a lot.	Dufite byinshi.
You have it all.	Ufite byose.
You had it all.	Wari ufite byose.
Or you are very embarrassed.	Cyangwa ufite isoni cyane.
That's right- this is not about him.	Nibyo, igitekerezo cye gusa.
You can't wait.	Ntushobora gutegereza.
To be young.	Kuba muto.
He went close.	Yagiye hafi.
You can't tell what happened.	Ntushobora kumenya uko byagenze.
He was alone, as usual.	Yari wenyine, nkuko bisanzwe.
He was alone at the time.	Icyo gihe yari wenyine.
You can also be away.	Urashobora kandi kuba kure.
I have to talk to you.	Ngomba kuvugana nawe.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
I don't know what to think.	Ntabwo nzi icyo ntekereza.
But he had high expectations.	Ariko yari yiteze byinshi.
To live, you can say.	Kubaho, ushobora kuvuga.
They are friends.	Ni inshuti.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He had no expectations.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yiteze.
You have to believe.	Ugomba kwizera.
He needed to know what he needed to know.	Yari akeneye kumenya icyo yari akeneye kumenya.
I knew better than to look away.	Nari nzi neza kuruta kureba kure.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amahirwe.
He was, in fact, an undercover detective mounting a sting operation.	Ari, mubyukuri, ntacyo yavuze na gato.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza muri njye.
This would be true.	Ibi byaba aribyo.
He agreed to do so.	Yemeye kubikora.
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
No one said.	Nta muntu n'umwe yabwiye.
Probably no one knew who he was.	Birashoboka ko nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi uwo ari we.
He didn't seem happy.	Ntabwo yasaga naho yishimiye.
That's not all there is to it.	Ntabwo aribyo byose bigoye kubona.
He wanted to do everything.	Yashakaga gukora byose.
But it's good to have.	Ariko ni byiza kugira.
He’s just a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza gusa.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
He was still a teacher.	Kugeza ubu yari umwarimu.
went to the problem.	yagiye ikibazo.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
As if we were friends.	Nkaho turi inshuti.
If it weren't for me more than my daughter.	Niba atari njye kurenza umukobwa wanjye.
That's not the point.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu.
He had not said much.	Ntabwo yari yavuze byinshi.
We are everything, all the time.	Turi buri kintu buri gihe, igihe cyose.
The money is here.	Amafaranga ari hano.
It's too small.	Ni muto cyane kurenza ibyo.
We have to be able to do it right.	Tugomba kuba dushobora gukora neza.
Things were going well.	Ibintu byari byiza.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, ni byiza.
He watched for a long time.	Yarebye igihe kirekire.
I must have felt bad.	Ngomba kuba numvise nabi.
I was not sure what to do.	Sinari nzi neza icyo tugomba gukora.
And tomorrow.	Kandi ejo.
I have to make sure he goes.	Ngomba kumenya neza ko agenda.
This is not a good thing for us.	Iki ntabwo ari ikintu cyiza kuri twe.
But it should not exist.	Ariko ntagomba kubaho.
But he would not go.	Ariko ntiyari kugenda.
However, there is no turning back.	Ariko, nta gusubira inyuma.
You may know what it is.	Ushobora kuba uzi icyo aricyo.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
He said he may have a friend.	Yavuze ko ashobora kuba afite inshuti.
You can't see.	Ntushobora kubona.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
Everything would be fine.	Byose byari kuba byiza.
And no one would hear.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe yari kumva.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
I have to go wrong.	Ngomba kugenda nabi.
This is really good.	Ibi rwose ni byiza.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
I've seen enough.	Nabonye bihagije.
Money is a small thing.	Amafaranga ni ikintu gito.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
Whatever you like.	Icyo ukunda cyose.
They knew a lot.	Bari bazi byinshi.
Or it was.	Cyangwa byari.
It was not his day.	Ntabwo wari umunsi we.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
But who I was.	Ariko uwo yari njye.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
But that's exactly what he did.	Ariko ibyo ni byo yakoze byose.
I can't figure out why.	Sinshobora kumenya impamvu.
He thought.	Yatekerezaga.
And that’s something you have to do.	Kandi ni ikintu ugomba gukora.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
However, he saw something else.	Ariko, yabonye ikindi.
But we have to try.	Ariko tugomba kugerageza.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
All people are one family.	Abantu bose ni umuryango umwe.
Great to hear from you again.	Nibyiza cyane kongera kumva ushaka.
I have nothing to say on the phone.	Ntacyo nshobora kuvuga kuri terefone.
The house was beautiful.	Inzu yari nziza.
This is always the case.	Buri gihe ni impamvu.
Today, you need to study.	Uyu munsi, ukeneye kwiga.
Anyone can say what they want.	Umuntu wese arashobora kuvuga icyo ashaka.
Only it was not normal.	Gusa ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
In fact, that's not the case.	Mubyukuri, ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
No need to think about this.	Nta mpamvu yo gutekereza ibi.
I do everything.	Nkora byose.
He was always very popular.	Buri gihe yakundaga cyane.
It always looks good on me.	Buri gihe birasa neza kuri njye.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
It's his fault.	Ni amakosa ye.
That was true.	Nibyo byari ukuri.
Or in fact he thought he would be there.	Cyangwa mubyukuri yatekereje kuba ahari rwose.
That won't be a problem.	Ibyo ntabwo bizaba ikibazo.
Both were about thirty.	Bombi bari hafi mirongo itatu.
Today is very likely.	Uyu munsi birashoboka cyane.
One has to do it.	Umuntu agomba kubikora.
It all looks good.	Byose birasa neza.
For a while, he was worried.	Mu gihe gito, yari afite impungenge.
I am a thirty year old girl.	Ndi umukobwa umwe ufite imyaka mirongo itatu.
It is not good.	Ntabwo ari mwiza.
More than anyone.	Kuruta umuntu uwo ari we wese.
We were here.	Twari hano.
I like clothes.	Nkunda imyenda.
You can't do anything alone in this world.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu wenyine muri iyi si.
Especially now.	Cyane cyane ubu.
He really helped out for no reason.	Yakundaga gufasha rwose nta mpamvu.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
He said he would come to where I was at the time.	Yavuze ko icyo gihe yari kuza aho ndi.
He always listens.	Buri gihe ahora yumva.
There is one more thing.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
You are my son.	Uri umuhungu wanjye.
This morning, you were one.	Muri iki gitondo, wari umwe.
Well, well, well.	Nibyiza, byiza.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He did not know where he was now.	Ntiyari azi aho yari ari ubu.
They have a lot of things.	Bafite ibintu byinshi.
.	.
Just what he has to do.	Gusa icyo agomba kuba akora.
I wanted to stay.	Nashakaga kuguma.
I know it's not my fault.	Nzi ko atari amakosa yanjye.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
You always have a plan.	Buri gihe ufite gahunda.
But that is probably not the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari byo.
He told me he was an expert.	Yambwiye ko ari umuhanga.
He did not want to be alone again.	Ntiyashakaga kongera kuba wenyine.
But we have what we have.	Ariko dufite ibyo dufite.
And that's a big deal.	Kandi ni ikibazo kinini.
She is my child.	Ni umwana wanjye.
For now it would be nice.	Kuri ubu byaba byiza.
This was one day, always.	Uyu wari umunsi umwe, buri gihe.
There are many people here in this world.	Hano kuri iyi si hariho abantu benshi.
From here on out.	Kuva hanze aha.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ariko ntabwo buri gihe.
But that is not the case here.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo hano.
He had a family.	Yari afite umuryango.
Money is not a thing.	Amafaranga ntabwo ari ikintu.
He went.	Yagiye.
He thought maybe it was wrong.	Yatekereje ko ahari atari byo.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe.
I should have tried harder.	Nari nkwiye kugerageza cyane.
He did everything right.	Yakoze byose neza.
Nothing now.	Nta kintu na kimwe ubu.
You can't say who.	Ntushobora kuvuga uwo.
All of this is not true.	Ibi byose ntabwo ari ukuri.
For him.	Kuri we.
Everything he had was upstairs.	Ibintu byose yari afite byari hejuru.
He hopes for the best.	Yizeye uburyo.
He thought he was doing something good.	Yatekereje ko akora ikintu cyiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
And it is only possible.	Kandi birashoboka gusa.
It was not good at all.	Ntabwo byari byiza rwose.
I thought he would do it.	Natekereje ko azabikora.
It worked out well, well.	Byagenze neza, neza.
He expected that.	Yari yiteze ko.
Above him.	Hejuru ye.
But it is good.	Ariko ni byiza.
We have no time.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya.
You know the house.	Uzi inzu.
But for many, this is true.	Ariko, kuri benshi, ibi nukuri.
He tried once.	Yagerageje rimwe.
You said	Wavuze.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
You are not sure why there are so many people.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu hariho abantu benshi.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
I think it was good.	Ntekereza ko byari byiza.
He did not know his problem.	Ntiyari azi ikibazo cye.
If he was alone, that would be fine.	Niba yari wenyine, byari byiza.
But obviously not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari byo.
There is truth in truth.	Hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
He sits well.	Yicaye neza.
My child was no longer in me.	Umwana wanjye ntiyari akiri muri njye.
That doesn't go away.	Ibyo nta kugenda.
This would do nothing wrong.	Ibi ntacyo byari gukora nabi.
He didn't have to do this.	Ntabwo yagombaga gukora ibi.
It wasn’t just his age.	Ntabwo yari imyaka ye gusa.
I need to know what he knows.	Nkeneye kumenya icyo azi.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
It's good in the back.	Nibyiza inyuma.
I would know where you are.	Nari kumenya aho uri.
We have to be there.	Tugomba kuba ahari.
I didn't know that.	Sinari nzi icyo.
You always love	Buri gihe ukunda.
Someone who knows his place.	Umuntu uzi umwanya we.
Something he had to do.	Ikintu yagombaga gukora.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
But that was enough.	Ariko byari bihagije.
It won't be long.	Ntabwo bizaba igihe kirekire.
We have to try.	Tugomba kugerageza.
Everyone deserves a chance.	Umuntu wese akwiye amahirwe.
I was going to tell someone.	Nari ngiye kubwira umuntu.
I was a woman.	Nari umugore.
Maybe he thought he could see.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje ko ashobora kubona.
We have a plan.	Dufite gahunda.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
I knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi.
She loved clothes.	Yakundaga imyenda.
He saw nothing.	Nta kintu yabonye.
I may have a problem.	Nshobora kugira ikibazo.
But you have to know what to do.	Ariko ugomba kumenya icyo ukora.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
But this would be great.	Ariko iyi yaba nziza.
I really have to go now.	Ngomba rwose kugenda ubu.
He thinks only of food.	Yibwira ibiryo gusa.
In the long run, no.	Mu gihe kirekire, ntabwo.
The car is far away.	Imodoka iri kure.
Things will be better.	Ibintu bizaba byiza.
I was at school.	Nari ku ishuri.
Nothing wrong, nothing wrong.	Nta kibi nta kibi.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
There are enough things to do.	Hariho ibintu bihagije byo gukora.
But, it’s too much.	Ariko, ni byinshi cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari birashoboka.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
He knew where he was.	Yari azi aho ari.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You are, no.	Uri, ntabwo.
It was a lot.	Byari byinshi.
The idea is absolutely wrong.	Igitekerezo ni kibi rwose.
Well done.	Neza neza.
This was not true.	Ibi ntabwo byari ukuri.
We are on the phone.	Ni terefone.
Every night if possible.	Buri joro niba bishoboka.
They are all human.	Bose ni abantu.
They didn’t have much luck.	Ntabwo bari bafite amahirwe menshi.
I just saw this.	Gusa nabonye ibi.
Recently,.	Vuba aha ,.
We are not many.	Ntabwo turi benshi.
They would definitely do it.	Rwose bari kubikora.
And people know things.	Kandi abantu bazi ibintu.
For me, it was.	Kuri njye, byari.
He asked for help.	Yasabye ubufasha.
You can.	Ushobora .
It's good to be scared.	Nibyiza kugira ubwoba.
I need something.	Nkeneye ikintu.
No one had much to say.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite byinshi byo kuvuga.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
I really have.	Mfite rwose.
Obviously that is it.	Biragaragara ko aribyo.
Me? 	Njye?
I have something to say.	Mfite ikintu kuri.
But so far they know.	Ariko kugeza ubu nibyo bazi.
I hope we can do better.	Nizera ko dushobora gukora neza.
But he also did not say.	Ariko na we ntiyigeze avuga.
It is very likely that it is a house.	Birashoboka cyane ko ari inzu.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
You are human.	Uri umuntu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
I always thought it was me.	Buri gihe natekerezaga ko ari njye.
I needed.	Nari nkeneye.
You are the reason.	Uri impamvu.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
It is not always easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye.
Of course, you know you're a good teacher.	Nukuri, uzi ko uri umwarimu mwiza.
He went to school a lot.	Yagiye ku ishuri cyane.
We have a plan.	Dufite gahunda.
.	.
We were close before.	Twari hafi mbere.
You can try it out.	Urashobora kugerageza kugerageza.
I heard.	Numvise.
I think you should stay here.	Ndatekereza ko ugomba kuguma hano.
He goes alone.	Agenda wenyine.
And a very good thing.	Kandi ikintu cyiza cyane.
The space is not good.	Umwanya ntabwo ari mwiza.
'	'
I had a lot.	Nari byinshi.
I'm worried about living together.	Mfite impungenge kubana.
It was too much at the time.	Icyo gihe byari byinshi cyane.
I'm eating.	Ndimo kurya.
You are, sometimes.	Uri, rimwe na rimwe.
No one was coming.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kuza.
This is it.	Uri uyu.
From top to bottom.	Hejuru kugeza hasi.
Glad you got a job.	Nishimiye ko wabonye akazi.
You can play like that.	Urashobora gukina gutya.
You have to be good.	Ugomba kuba mwiza.
You can read more about me here !.	Urashobora gusoma byinshi kuri njye hano!.
He wanted to know more about her.	Yashakaga kumenya byinshi kuri we.
Probably not tonight.	Birashoboka ko atari iri joro.
The last thing she needed today was a woman.	Ikintu cya nyuma yari akeneye muri iki gihe ni umugore.
Then everything will be fine.	Icyo gihe ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
The bus was gone.	Bisi yari yagiye.
What you do.	Ibyo ukora.
There are problems, though.	Hariho ibibazo, naho.
As he was an actor.	Nkuko yari umukinnyi.
There is something wrong here.	Hano hari ikintu kibi.
One was young.	Umwe yari akiri muto.
He said he had.	Yavuze ko yari afite.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
But that is his problem.	Ariko icyo ni ikibazo cye.
But it was difficult.	Ariko byari bigoye.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
He was not happy.	Ntabwo yishimiye.
Everything was very nice and nice.	Byose byari byiza cyane kandi byiza.
Looks good !.	Birasa neza!.
You can learn a lot from.	Urashobora kwiga byinshi kuri.
He didn't know much else.	Ntiyari azi neza ikindi.
Good.	Byiza.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
Are people scared? 	Abantu bafite ubwoba?
I'm close now.	Ubu ndi hafi.
There is no such thing as a good plan.	Nta na gahunda nziza.
I wanted it to be harder.	Nashakaga ko bigoye kuruta ibyo.
If anyone can find a job, he is.	Niba hari ushobora kubona akazi, ni we.
She felt embarrassed.	Yumvise afite isoni.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kujyana gusa.
This is your mistake.	Iki ni amakosa yawe.
He is the best we have.	Niwe mwiza dufite.
That is the day.	Ibyo ni umunsi.
He can't even speak.	Ntashobora no kuvuga.
Doing something good is the same.	Gukora ikintu cyiza ni kimwe.
And he has to.	Kandi agomba.
What he plans to do now.	Ibyo ateganya gukora ubu.
That will happen.	Ibyo bizaba.
It was really nice to work.	Gukora byari byiza rwose.
Or he thought he did.	Cyangwa yatekereje ko yabikoze.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
Looks like he's a friend.	Birasa nkaho ari inshuti.
However, doing this well is not easy.	Ariko, gukora ibi neza ntabwo byoroshye.
He may have a reason.	Ashobora kuba afite impamvu.
I never did that.	Sinigeze nkora ibyo.
You are doing well.	Urimo ukora neza.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
At the same time, he is looking away.	Muri icyo gihe, arimo kureba kure.
He told me where the money was.	Yambwiye aho amafaranga ari.
Bottom line but not too low.	Hasi ariko ntabwo ari hasi cyane.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
He would know what to say next time.	Yari kumenya icyo avuga ikindi gihe.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
He knew the truth about her.	Yari azi ukuri kuri we.
But, he is right.	Ariko, afite ukuri.
Little did he know that you were his son.	Ntiyari azi ko uri umuhungu we.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibi ni kimwe no kuvuga, ubu ni ukuri.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
I mean, not really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo mubyukuri.
I never felt wise.	Sinigeze numva ubwenge.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
What you said was true.	Ibyo wavuze byari ukuri.
I wonder what it is.	Ndabaza icyo aricyo.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
But it looks very similar.	Ariko birasa cyane.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
You can live together.	Urashobora kubana.
I think the party went well.	Ntekereza ko ibirori byagenze neza.
Everyone has to go home now.	Umuntu wese agomba gutaha nonaha.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
It wouldn't be much.	Ntabwo byaba ari byinshi.
He knows where he has gone.	Azi aho yagiye.
We can never do that again.	Ntidushobora kongera kubikora.
But he would be one person.	Ariko yaba umuntu umwe.
You have a great idea.	Ufite igitekerezo cyiza.
The child is three years old.	Umwana afite imyaka itatu.
He was beautiful, but he was not intelligent.	Yari mwiza, ariko ntabwo yari afite ubwenge.
It was not a problem at all.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo na gato.
I love your family.	Nkunda umuryango wawe.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Maybe he can do something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo ashobora gukora.
It is not good and good.	Ntabwo ari byiza kandi byiza.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko atari byo.
One can always work at any time.	Umuntu arashobora gukora buri gihe igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
He is absolutely confident.	Yizeye rwose.
You really don't have to do everything.	Ntabwo rwose ugomba gukora byose.
But it worked.	Ariko byagenze neza.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
It's good to read.	Nibyiza gusoma.
Cookies.	Kuki.
But the gentle gentleman.	Ariko nyamuneka nyamuneka.
But he meant.	Ariko yashakaga kuvuga.
I want to be one.	Ndashaka kuba umwe.
But these are just kids.	Ariko aba ni abana gusa.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
We can't let that happen.	Ntidushobora kureka ibyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And now is the time.	Kandi ubu ni igihe cyiza.
He wants to.	Ashaka ko.
They know everything.	Bazi byose.
You have to be.	Ugomba kuba.
I never saw that.	Sinigeze mbona ibyo.
One by one.	Kimwe na hamwe.
He didn’t, at all.	Ntabwo yakoze, nta na gato.
He does what he wants to do.	Akora ibyo ashaka gukora.
But he was not inside.	Ariko ntabwo yari imbere.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And it will be true.	Kandi bizaba ukuri.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
I saw what happened.	Nabonye uko byagenze.
You deserve nothing.	Ntacyo ukwiye.
Everyone knew and loved.	Umuntu wese yari azi kandi akunda.
They know we're here.	Bazi ko turi hano.
You have nothing to lose.	Ntacyo ugomba gufata.
Absolutely not.	Nta gihe rwose.
He can do whatever he wants.	Arashobora gukora icyo ashaka cyose.
He has to be here by now.	Agomba kuba hano kugeza ubu.
He would do it right.	Nukuri yari kubikora neza.
Things are really good.	Ibintu ni byiza rwose.
Gentlemen, he was good at this.	Nyamuneka, yari mwiza kuri ibi.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But he has to have time.	Ariko agomba kugira umwanya.
He had it now.	Yari afite ubu.
It's a lot.	Ni byinshi.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
It was a privilege.	Byari amahirwe.
He was alone and probably bad.	Yari wenyine kandi birashoboka ko yari mubi.
However, that is not the case here or here.	Ariko, ibyo ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
This is true.	Iki ni ukuri.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
He has a lot of talent.	Afite impano nyinshi.
Someone.	Umuntu.
He thought it would be good for her.	Yatekereje ko byari kuba byiza kuri byo.
And he is absolutely right.	Kandi afite ukuri rwose.
She was well dressed.	Yari yambaye neza.
I was not behind.	Ntabwo nari inyuma.
That was really my fault.	Mubyukuri ibyo byari amakosa yanjye.
And, yes, they can be sources of troubles.	Kandi ,, birasa cyane.
He feels nothing.	Nta cyo yumva.
You don't have to stay.	Ntugomba kuguma.
You can learn anything !.	Urashobora kwiga ikintu na kimwe!.
He didn’t want to think about any of that.	Ntiyashakaga gutekereza kuri kimwe muri byo.
I want to do everything with you.	Ndashaka gukora byose hamwe nawe.
I knew I was so beautiful.	Nari nzi ko ndi mwiza cyane.
He was never ashamed.	Ntiyigeze agira isoni.
What should we do.	Tugomba gukora iki.
He likes to talk.	Akunda kuvuga.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
I feel close.	Ndumva uri hafi.
They know everything.	Bazi byose.
He was also a good thing.	Na we yari ikintu cyiza.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
He told me that.	Yambwiye ibyo.
We can't live that way.	Ntidushobora kubaho gutya.
His presence was excellent.	Kuba imbere ye byari byiza cyane.
This is not very difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye cyane.
But you have to wait.	Ariko ugomba gutegereza.
But it goes well.	Ariko kugenda neza.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I can't say right now.	Sinshobora kuvuga ubu.
He wished he was.	Yifuza ko yari.
He’s just a guy.	Ni umusore gusa.
A lot of things are obvious to me.	Ibintu byinshi biragaragara kuri njye.
They would be children.	Byaba ari abana.
I don't like this.	Ntabwo nkunda ibi.
I didn't get a job.	Nta kazi nabonye.
It is not a good book.	Ntabwo ari igitabo cyiza.
The woman was very beautiful.	Umugore yari mwiza cyane.
I want to do it tonight.	Ndashaka kubikora iri joro.
He said we were good food.	Yavuze ko twari ibiryo byiza.
He will never say goodbye.	Ntazigera avuga ko ari byiza.
He was at school at the time.	Icyo gihe yari ku ishuri.
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
He would never remarry.	Ntabwo yari kongera gushaka.
He is working hard.	Arimo gukora cyane.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo ari hano ubu.
You have to come now.	Ugomba kuza ubu.
Why he did it.	Impamvu yabikoze.
There is no going back on me now.	Nta gusubira inyuma kuri njye ubu.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
He said he was very happy to speak.	Yavuze ko yishimiye cyane kuvuga.
Seems like a simple matter to me.	Birasa naho ari ibintu byoroshye kuri njye.
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
He was not alone.	Ntiyari wenyine.
He didn't look like her.	Ntabwo yasaga na we.
He is not ready.	Ntabwo yiteguye.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
I know everything.	Nzi byose.
He thought.	Yatekerezaga.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
Kandi.	Kandi.
Maybe only once.	Ahari rimwe gusa.
I'm in this room.	Ndi muri iki cyumba.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane ko byari byiza.
No one said.	Nta n'umwe wigeze avuga.
I don't believe so.	Ntabwo nizera ko aribyo.
Very much here.	Hano cyane.
He looked frightened.	Yarebye afite ubwoba.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo bishoboka cyane.
He was very close.	Yari hafi cyane.
That's right.	Nibyiza nibyo.
Eating too much '.	Kurya cyane '.
Nothing to look at.	Ntacyo kureba.
In the end, it is not.	Amaherezo, ariko sibyo.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I was just a kid at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umwana gusa.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
Very bad thing.	Ikintu kibi cyane.
Every night was a chance.	Buri joro ryari amahirwe.
Good inside.	Byiza imbere.
He has someone inside.	Afite umuntu imbere.
Instead of panicking, he went downstairs.	Aho kugira ubwoba, yagiye hasi.
He should have known better.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza.
I'm good at school.	Ndi mwiza mu ishuri.
That's right.	Nibyo.
What he needed was true.	Ibyo yari akeneye byari ukuri.
I want to be at home.	Ndashaka ko murugo.
He could have made his own choice.	Yashoboraga gufata ibyo yahisemo.
When he was still.	Igihe yari akiri.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
It's good for me.	Ni mwiza kuri njye.
Everyone should have one.	Umuntu wese agomba kugira umwe.
She is afraid to go outside.	Afite ubwoba bwo kujya hanze.
That's all he did, but it was enough.	Ibyo aribyo byose yakoze, ariko byari bihagije.
What everyone does together is what they choose.	Ibyo buri wese akora hamwe nibyo yahisemo.
It was not easy for him.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye kuri we.
I had a dog.	Nari mfite imbwa.
It's not something you need to come to see.	Ntabwo ari ikintu ukeneye kuza kureba.
That's not what he did.	Ntabwo aribyo yakoze.
He is going to have a plan.	Agiye kugira gahunda.
He can't go.	Ntashobora kugenda.
I hear a lot.	Ndumva byinshi.
Tomorrow will be you.	Ejo bizaba wowe.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
I was scared.	Nari mfite ubwoba.
I feel like we can eat on this for a while.	Ndumva dushobora kurya kuri ibi igihe gito.
I'm going to go back.	Ngiye gusubira inyuma.
He doesn't know how.	Ntabwo azi uko.
I need to go outside.	Nkeneye kujya hanze.
We are all human.	Twese turi abantu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But he will probably do it.	Ariko birashoboka ko azabikora.
He feels he must do as he does.	Yumva agomba gukora nkuko abikora.
He is not his father.	Ntabwo ari se.
In my opinion, this is an idea.	Njye mbona, iyi ni igitekerezo.
I want to try something else.	Ndashaka kugerageza ikindi kintu.
Eventually, someone did something.	Amaherezo, umuntu yagize icyo akora.
But this is not the case.	Ariko si ibi.
Good things upstairs.	Ibintu byiza byo hejuru.
I wanted to know why.	Nashakaga kumenya impamvu.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
I just wanted to find a way to live.	Nashakaga gusa gushaka uburyo bwo kubaho.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
He was a friend to many.	Yari inshuti kuri benshi.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari rwose.
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
That's all he saw.	Ibyo ni byo yabonye byose.
When you have time to do it.	Mugihe ufite umwanya wo kubikora.
He seemed scared.	Yasaga naho afite ubwoba.
It was a great party.	Byari ibirori byiza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, mubyukuri.
I am his wife now.	Ndi umugore we ubu.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
It's inside.	Ni imbere.
I need	Nkeneye.
I like difficult things.	Nkunda ibintu bigoye.
But so was he.	Ariko na we ni ko yari.
That's you	Uwo ni wowe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we ari we.
His first daughter.	Umukobwa we wa mbere.
She was a girl.	Yari umukobwa.
Here’s a really good tip.	Hano hari inama nziza rwose.
He said that was the case.	Yavuze ko ibyo ari byo.
Thirty years.	Imyaka mirongo itatu.
This is a lot.	Ibi ni byinshi.
I know that plan.	Nzi iyo gahunda.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
He wasn't sure if he could do it.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ashobora kubikora.
He wanted to be close to me.	Yashakaga kuba hafi yanjye.
I do not know how to read.	Ntazi gusoma.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
He later thought about it.	Nyuma yaje gutekereza.
I think so.	Ntekereza cyane.
You think you can do whatever you want.	Utekereza ko ushobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
Maybe I don’t want to be a teacher.	Birashoboka ko ntashaka kuba umwarimu.
Tell you the truth, now.	Mbwira ukuri, ubu.
Or better.	Cyangwa nziza.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
We are at work.	Turi ku kazi.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
Not that he has.	Ntabwo ari uko yaba afite.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He was not out.	Ntiyari hanze.
He had eaten well.	Yari amaze kurya neza.
He made a mistake.	Yakoze amakosa.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
The thing is.	Ikintu ni.
That's great, for me.	Nibyiza cyane, kuri njye.
He heard something.	Yumvise ikintu.
And when someone has a problem.	Kandi mugihe hari umuntu ufite ikibazo.
Absolutely.	Nukuri cyane.
Not all is good in prison.	Ntabwo ari byiza byose muri gereza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
Really, really bad.	Mubyukuri, mubi rwose.
He didn't need to talk.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kuvuga.
But he is not talking about that.	Ariko ntabwo avuga kuri ibyo.
A young man has his needs.	Umusore afite ibyo akeneye.
He knew what he was up to.	Yari azi icyo yari arimo.
I would not quit my job.	Sinari kureka akazi.
It's great here.	Nibyiza cyane hano.
He had the same idea.	Yari afite igitekerezo kimwe.
Read more.	Gusoma byinshi.
But he was bad.	Ariko yari mubi.
I have to say this.	Ngomba kuvuga ibi.
He must have faith.	Agomba kugira kwizera.
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
Obviously, this is not the case today.	Biragaragara ko, iki gihe atari byo.
He used to do it.	Yakundaga kubikora.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntiyashakaga cyane kuvuga.
I know you can do better.	Nzi ko ushobora gukora neza.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
There are good dogs here.	Hano hari imbwa nziza.
You wouldn't know he had.	Ntabwo wari kumenya ko afite.
He was three years old.	Yari afite imyaka itatu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
What we need to know is where.	Icyo dukeneye kumenya ni he.
Looks like it's possible.	Birasa nkaho bishoboka.
It was really good, but close.	Byari byiza rwose, ariko hafi.
He was looking for a way to help.	Yashakaga uburyo bwo gufasha.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
The more opportunities you have, the more opportunities you have.	Amahirwe menshi ufite, amahirwe menshi ufite.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon enough.	Birashoboka ko atari uyu munsi, birashoboka ko atari ejo, ariko vuba bihagije.
He had a place to live.	Yari afite aho agomba kuba.
Only one time.	Umwanya umwe gusa.
In this case, the idea is not bad.	Kuri iki kibazo, igitekerezo ntabwo ari kibi.
But I can't think.	Ariko ntashobora gutekereza.
He knew everything about her.	Yari azi byose kuri we.
This is not good for me.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza kuri njye.
I mean, for me.	Ndashaka kuvuga, kuri njye.
For me that was my gift.	Kuri njye iyo yari impano yanjye.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo aribyo.
He did not want to reach out to anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kugeza uwo muntu uwo ari we wese.
His father bought a car.	Se yaguze imodoka.
But it was true.	Ariko byari ukuri.
But he will do it later.	Ariko azabikora nyuma.
Whenever that happens.	Igihe cyose ibyo byaba.
We can't go back.	Ntidushobora gusubira inyuma.
This is just the truth.	Ibi ni ukuri gusa.
He would not have won this.	Ntabwo yari gutsinda iyi.
The truth is, he didn't hear anything.	Ukuri nuko ntacyo yumvise.
He was not included.	Ntabwo yari arimo.
But that's right.	Ariko ibyo ni byo.
I was all.	Nari bose.
This is definitely a bad idea.	Iki rwose ni igitekerezo kibi.
But what you need to know is true.	Ariko icyo ugomba kumenya nukuri.
I just need money until then.	Nkeneye amafaranga gusa kugeza icyo gihe.
We have a car.	Dufite imodoka.
I need money very, very much.	Nkeneye amafaranga cyane, cyane.
And good luck to me.	Kandi amahirwe kuri njye.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
Bad thing to say.	Ikintu kibi cyo kuvuga.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
But it is normal.	Ariko ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I'm out, whatever.	Ndi hanze, ibyo aribyo byose.
Anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese.
And everyone had that.	Kandi buri wese yari afite ibyo.
We have a lot of problems.	Dufite ibibazo byinshi.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
First of all, they are on time.	Mbere ya byose, bari ku gihe.
My good guy.	Umusore wanjye mwiza.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
A good friend indeed.	Inshuti nziza mubyukuri.
He never went alone.	Ntabwo yigeze agenda wenyine.
Everything.	Byose.
He has to do it.	Agomba kubikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
There is only you and me.	Hariho wowe na njye gusa.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
It was a party.	Wari ibirori.
'	'
This is a big deal.	Iki ni ikintu kinini.
But it would not remain on the ground.	Ariko ntiyari kuguma hasi.
But that is not all.	Ariko sibyo rwose.
It's hair.	Ni umusatsi.
He said he looked good.	Yavuze ko yasaga neza.
He had no reason.	Ntiyari afite impamvu.
Not today, but soon.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi, ariko vuba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, rimwe na rimwe, birashoboka rwose.
I’m not sure he really wants to be there.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko ashaka rwose kuba ahari.
In front of him, there is not much to say.	Imbere ye, ntabwo ari byinshi byo kuvuga.
I mean, anyone.	Ndashaka kuvuga, umuntu uwo ari we wese.
That, of course, is not the case.	Ibyo biragaragara, rwose, ntabwo ari akazi.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kubaho.
However, for our needs, it was not good enough.	Ariko, kubyo dukeneye, ntabwo byari byiza bihagije.
Your family, your family.	Umuryango wawe, umuryango wawe.
You don't have to do this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
He was now behind me.	Ubu yari inyuma yanjye.
This problem I see all the time.	Iki kibazo mbona buri gihe.
But he also loves parties.	Ariko kandi akunda ibirori.
He was probably inside.	Birashoboka ko yari imbere.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You have to be alone.	Ugomba kuba wenyine.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
No job.	Nta kazi.
I never thought much of it.	Ntabwo nigeze ntekereza cyane.
Knowing exactly what he is up to.	Kumenya neza icyo yaba arimo.
I have been in it for a long time.	Ndi muri yo igihe kirekire.
Everything is clear.	Byose biragaragara.
Kids like me.	Abana nkanjye.
Maybe you're lucky.	Birashoboka ko ufite amahirwe.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe no guhagarika.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
We are a gift.	Ni impano.
Especially when he is right.	Cyane cyane iyo afite ukuri.
To do it all.	Kubikora byose.
He was not ready to give up.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye kureka.
At that point I had to go.	Icyo gihe nari nkwiye kugenda.
There is something here for everyone.	Hano hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
I saw something this morning.	Nabonye ikintu muri iki gitondo.
What? 	Niki?
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
He had nothing to do with it.	Ntacyo yari afite cyo kubikora.
I have to go to work now.	Ngomba kujya ku kazi ubu.
From the movie there.	Kuva muri firime aho.
I see nothing.	Ntacyo mbona.
They are scared.	Bafite ubwoba.
To try	Kugerageza.
He was human.	Yari umuntu.
Stop thinking too much.	Reka gutekereza cyane.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
He did this yesterday.	Yakoze ibi ejo.
Try it now.	Kugerageza ubu.
It is not wise.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge.
You are what you are.	Uri icyo uri cyo.
I need	Nkeneye.
He saw something.	Yabonye ikintu.
We all had.	Twese twari dufite.
He did well.	Yakoze neza.
I have all the time we need.	Mfite igihe cyose dukeneye.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
You can tell.	Urashobora kuvuga.
We now need a new plan.	Ubu dukeneye gahunda nshya.
This, obviously, is a bad idea.	Ibi, biragaragara, ni igitekerezo kibi.
And he has a plan.	Kandi afite gahunda.
Everything looks good now.	Ibintu byose birasa neza ubu.
He looked at something else though.	Yarebye ikindi ariko.
You are	Uri se.
The guy.	Umusore.
But he asked if it was okay.	Ariko yabajije niba ari byiza.
I didn't want money at all.	Sinifuzaga amafaranga na gato.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
He says nothing.	Nta cyo avuga.
.	.
He was not expecting anything in return.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
He can talk to you about doing good things.	Ashobora kuvugana nawe gukora ibintu byiza.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
I am doing well.	Nkora neza.
You are her daughter, whether good or bad.	Uri umukobwa we, waba mwiza cyangwa mubi.
It's not just about talking.	Ntabwo ari kuvuga gusa.
I can't do it alone.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora wenyine.
If that's the case then you are right.	Niba aribyo ushaka kuvuga birashoboka rwose.
You have to know what you want.	Ugomba kumenya icyo ushaka.
He has to eat.	Agomba kurya.
He said he could read.	Yavuze ko ashobora gusoma.
I think that is possible.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka.
You never liked it.	Ntabwo wigeze ukunda.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko atari mugihe cya vuba.
A little time.	Umwanya muto.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
He looked before turning back.	Yarebye mbere yo gusubira inyuma.
It's us.	Ni twe.
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
And the food, obviously.	Kandi ibiryo, biragaragara.
I always think.	Ntekereza buri gihe.
Behind him he felt the movement.	Inyuma ye yumva kugenda.
Everything was very difficult.	Ibintu byose byari bigoye cyane.
Getting a job.	Kubona akazi.
But that did not happen.	Ariko ntabwo byagenze.
Was he there ?.	Yari ahari?.
It seems.	Birasa.
But that is not the big problem.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo kinini.
That was true, as it happened.	Ibyo byari ukuri, uko byagenze.
And that is not good.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
And I really enjoyed the opportunity.	Kandi nishimiye cyane amahirwe.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ni ikintu gito.
There is money here.	Hano hari amafaranga.
I am an expert.	Ndi umuhanga.
He needed to talk to her.	Yari akeneye kuvugana na we.
Something very bad for him.	Ikintu kibi cyane kuri we.
Shame.	Isoni.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He needed to live.	Yari akeneye kubaho.
He had to be young at home.	Yagombaga kuba muto murugo.
All together.	Byose hamwe hamwe.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
You see, they do.	Wabonye ko abikora.
Absolutely this.	Ibi rwose.
However, sometimes there is something wrong.	Ariko, rimwe na rimwe hari ikintu kibi.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
The method is possible.	Uburyo bishoboka.
There is something about that.	Hariho ikintu kuri ibyo.
He was here.	Yari hano.
He was good at speaking.	Yari umuhanga mu kuvuga.
This was definitely a great thing.	Ibi rwose byari ibintu byiza cyane.
Every day, in fact.	Buri munsi, mubyukuri.
Maybe in front of you.	Ahari imbere yawe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He doesn't want or need money.	Ntashaka cyangwa akeneye amafaranga.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
It was easy to do.	Byari byoroshye gukora.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
It would only have happened later.	Gusa byari kuba nyuma aho yari ari.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
Here is a young man with problems.	Hano hari umusore ufite ibibazo.
This is a problem.	Iki ni ikibazo.
'.	'.
Just normal things.	Gusa ibintu bisanzwe.
Everyone had a gift.	Umuntu wese yari afite impano.
I have to do this and sometimes.	Ngomba gukora ibi kandi rimwe na rimwe.
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
That's not what he does.	Ntabwo aribyo akora.
We are all scared.	Twese dufite ubwoba.
They are 20 years old.	Bafite imyaka 20.
I can't even stop the car.	Sinshobora no guhagarika imodoka.
But he came alone.	Ariko yaje wenyine.
You have nothing.	Ntacyo ufite.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
It was not a big deal.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo kinini.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
We are many.	Turi benshi.
I got out of this now.	Nabonye kuva muri ibi nonaha.
But obviously not.	Ariko biragaragara ko atari byo.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
He just says what he wants.	Gusa avuga icyo ashaka.
He had enough problems.	Yari afite ibibazo bihagije.
I mean someone.	Ndashaka kuvuga umuntu.
It can't go fast enough.	Ntashobora kugenda vuba bihagije.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
He is human.	Ni umuntu.
That would work.	Ibyo byari gukora.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
It's beautiful, it's beautiful.	Ni mwiza, ni mwiza rwose.
He was very lucky.	Yagize amahirwe menshi.
He has.	Afite.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva kwizera.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze agira.
However, please.	Ariko, nyamuneka.
I have a good idea.	Mfite igitekerezo cyiza.
I'm glad that.	Nishimiye ibyo.
Someone here.	Hano hari umuntu.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He is going to speak.	Agiye kuvuga.
That's not the case here.	Ntabwo aribyo hano.
I have to try that.	Ngomba kugerageza ibyo.
I don't want to go home.	Sinshaka gutaha.
He has no plans.	Nta kintu na kimwe ateganya.
He was no longer.	Ntabwo yari akiri.
That's not the case.	Ntabwo ari uko byagenze.
He was sitting behind her.	Yari yicaye inyuma ye.
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
I don't want problems.	Sinshaka ibibazo.
I can't do that.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora.
Probably, one day.	Birashoboka, umunsi umwe.
I had a job.	Nari mfite akazi.
I need a friend.	Nkeneye inshuti yanjye.
I want them to live here.	Ndashaka ko aba hano.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
You can't make mistakes.	Ntushobora gukora amakosa.
He had a lot.	Yari afite byinshi.
He just wanted to be better than me.	Gusa yashakaga kundusha.
Yari.	Yari.
he must be his.	agomba kuba we.
I can't do this.	Sinshobora gukora ibi.
That's right.	Nukuri.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu.
He was very focused on one thing.	Yatekerezaga cyane kuri kimwe.
Transportation and transportation and transportation.	Gutwara no gutwara no gutwara.
No work at all.	Nta kazi gato.
It's really a great program.	Mubyukuri ni gahunda nziza cyane.
I need to help my child.	Nkeneye gufasha umwana wanjye.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
He may be there.	Ashobora kuba ahari.
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
He found his first house.	Yabonye inzu ye ya mbere.
Or when someone just said it.	Cyangwa iyo umuntu yavuze gusa.
Be alone.	Yaba wenyine.
I also need to look back.	Nkeneye kandi kubona inyuma.
It is not his family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango we.
Time is very short.	Igihe ni gito cyane.
You got to read everything.	Wabonye gusoma byose.
No walking in the room.	Nta kugenda mu cyumba.
I have nothing to do with that.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora kuri ibyo.
There is not much to do.	Nta byinshi byo gukora.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
It was good to go.	Kugenda byari byiza.
He has the opportunity to get a job.	Afite amahirwe yo kubona akazi.
I know it's not easy.	Nzi ko atari ibintu byoroshye.
I didn't know anyone.	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nzi.
He can study.	Arashobora kwiga.
I was not sure what to do.	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
Maybe something else.	Ahari ikindi kintu.
She is a very beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza cyane.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
You are not sure of this.	Ntabwo uzi neza ibi.
He said he was not there.	Yavuze ko atari ahari.
Everything is fine.	Kubaho byose ni byiza.
He speaks quickly.	Avuga vuba vuba.
I can't be here all day.	Sinshobora kuba hano umunsi wose.
I had the money.	Nari mfite amafaranga.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
He can't stop looking.	Ntashobora kureka kureba.
But one cannot have everything.	Ariko umuntu ntashobora kugira byose.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
He did not know why.	Ntabwo yari azi impamvu.
He could have seen more.	Yashoboraga kubona byinshi.
I am very happy.	Nishimiye cyane.
I ask questions.	Ndabaza ibibazo.
He came today.	Yaje muri iki gihe.
He was a good boy.	Yari umuhungu mwiza.
You have to find something you know above.	Ugomba kubona ikintu uzi hejuru.
Those who want to stay here can stay here.	Ushaka kuguma hano arashobora kuguma hano.
The guy really was.	Umusore rwose yari arimo.
Easy and simple.	Byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
But there is more here.	Ariko hano hari byinshi.
They were his people.	Bari abantu be.
He is not a bad guy.	Ntabwo ari umusore mubi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
We have many children.	Dufite abana benshi.
The little girl didn't want anything.	Umukobwa muto ntacyo yashakaga.
This is not an easy task.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
He went alone.	Yagiye wenyine.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He could see what you could be.	Yashoboraga kubona icyo ushobora kuba cyo.
You were a child.	Wari umwana.
That's not the problem.	Icyo si ikibazo.
He seems to be alone.	Asa nkaho ari wenyine.
She was his wife.	Yari umugore we.
It would not be his house now.	Ntabwo yari kuba inzu ye ubu.
It was just an opportunity, in fact.	Byari amahirwe gusa, mubyukuri.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
And that’s a good idea.	Kandi ni igitekerezo cyiza.
He has it all.	Afite byose.
Money can buy time.	Amafaranga arashobora kugura umwanya.
It was all one for him.	Byose byari umwe kuri we.
He said he never did, but it is possible.	Yavuze ko atigeze abikora, ariko birashoboka.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He also asked why.	Na we yabajije impamvu.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
If he was good.	Niba yari mwiza.
You don't have to go.	Ntabwo ugomba kugenda.
He has everything here.	Afite ibintu byose hano.
I'm sure he didn't.	Nzi neza ko atabikoze.
If that weren’t the case, it wouldn’t have happened.	Niba ibyo atari byo, ntabwo byari kuba.
But it was true.	Ariko byari ukuri.
He was out and about.	Yari hanze hanze.
Many people.	Abantu benshi.
We are on time.	Turi ku gihe.
He may be.	Ashobora kuba.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
Yes, there is something.	Nibyo, hari ikintu.
I'm going home.	Ngiye gutaha.
He was far from her.	Yari kure ye.
He was not ready to give up.	Ntiyari yiteguye kureka.
But he was not far away.	Ariko nta kure yari kure.
And this is good.	Kandi ibi ni byiza.
He was well aware of all this.	Yari azi neza ibyo byose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko hari ukuri kuri kuri.
he had said.	yari yavuze.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byoroshye.
I am human too.	Nanjye ndi umuntu.
It's not time.	Ntabwo ari igihe.
I see everything.	Mbona byose.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora gutya.
And she is a woman.	Kandi ni umugore.
My wife will be too.	Umugore wanjye na we azaba.
Bad thing, bad thing.	Ikintu kibi, ikintu kibi.
However, it is clear that this did not happen.	Ariko, biragaragara ko atari ko byagenze.
Drink all the time.	Kunywa igihe cyose.
You alone.	Wowe wenyine.
I have a car here.	Mfite imodoka hano.
My son needs food.	Umuhungu wanjye akeneye kurya.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
It is not a house.	Ntabwo ari inzu.
She got her first hair.	Yabonye umusatsi we wa mbere.
I am very ashamed.	Mfite isoni cyane.
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
I did today.	Nakoze uyu munsi.
Just eat.	Kurya gusa.
No problem.	Nta kibazo na kimwe.
But here is the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo.
But many people are worried.	Ariko abantu benshi bafite impungenge.
Not always, but almost always.	Ntabwo buri gihe, ariko hafi ya buri gihe.
He bought time.	Yaguze igihe.
You do what you do.	Ukora ibyo ukora.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
Outside is outside.	Hanze hari hanze.
No one has ever been like him.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze asa na we.
It was not true at all.	Ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
But that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ariko ibyo ni byo kuri ubu.
There is not much to it.	Nta byinshi kuri byo.
You can't do that here.	Ntushobora kubikora hano.
I just don't know how to do it.	Gusa sinzi kubikora.
Very nice day	Umunsi mwiza cyane.
Someone was down.	Umuntu yari hasi.
You know you're scared.	Uzi neza ko ufite ubwoba.
And the plan.	Kandi gahunda.
My money.	Amafaranga yanjye.
You can't hear anything.	Ntushobora kumva ikintu na kimwe.
She was much younger than a girl at the time.	Icyo gihe yari muto cyane kuruta umukobwa.
I am doing very well.	Ndimo gukora neza cyane.
And you are.	Kandi uri.
And it’s not hard to see why.	Kandi ntabwo bigoye kubona impamvu.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
Space is short.	Umwanya ni muto.
He had his day.	Yagize umunsi we.
If you are.	Niba urimo.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He was a young man.	Yari umusore muto.
You know what you're seeing.	Uzi ibyo urimo kubona.
The truth is true for all of us.	Ukuri nukuri kuri twese.
Everyone has a good gift.	Umuntu wese afite impano nziza.
He is.	Niwe.
I think they know what to do.	Ntekereza ko bazi icyo gukora.
It was great to watch.	Byari byiza kureba.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I like to win.	Nkunda gutsinda.
That's not what you want to do.	Ntabwo aribyo ushaka gukora.
That's not the problem.	Icyo si cyo kibazo.
That would be all.	Ibyo bari kuba byose.
The problem is something everyone has to look for.	Ikibazo ni ikintu buri wese agomba gushaka.
Being alone.	Kuba wenyine.
He feels good.	Yumva ari umuntu mwiza.
We don't have that.	Ntabwo dufite ibyo.
Not many.	Nta benshi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
He did it once.	Yabikoze rimwe.
But there is a problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo.
You got it wrong.	Wabonye nabi.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
I'm sure it's a house.	Nzi neza ko ari inzu.
She has good hair.	Afite umusatsi mwiza.
He got his money first.	Yabonye amafaranga ye mbere.
If you have any ideas.	Niba ufite igitekerezo icyo ari cyo cyose.
But in reality, it is not.	Ariko mubyukuri, sibyo.
We need to live.	Dukeneye kubaho.
Maybe for a while.	Birashoboka ko hari igihe gito.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
Looking at the phone.	Kureba kuri terefone.
That is very possible.	Ibyo birashoboka cyane.
And I can't go.	Kandi ntashobora kugenda.
They are both in you.	Bombi bari muri wowe.
When possible.	Mugihe bishoboka.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
I and I were terrified.	Twe na njye twari dufite ubwoba rwose.
For one of them.	Kuri kimwe muri byo.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And he wanted the truth.	Kandi yashakaga ukuri.
I never heard of that.	Sinigeze numva ibyo.
But you can't.	Ariko ntushobora.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
I think he really likes this.	Ndatekereza ko mubyukuri akunda ibi.
However, there are ways to do that.	Ariko, hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
When he says something, that's right.	Iyo avuga ikintu na kimwe, nibyo.
And he can.	Kandi arashobora.
That was a good thing.	Nibyiza byari ibintu byiza.
All right.	Byose neza.
Too many, maybe.	Benshi cyane, birashoboka.
Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko ni byiza.
He has a good family.	Afite umuryango mwiza.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
He went ahead.	Yagiye imbere.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Or anyone.	Cyangwa n'umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It's good for her.	Ni mwiza kuri we.
It's normal.	Ni ibintu bisanzwe.
Something we have to do.	Ikintu tugomba gukora.
I can win.	Nshobora gutsinda.
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
To see	Kubona.
He didn't even want to swim.	Ntiyashakaga no koga.
No time.	Nta gihe.
It was not a chance for him at all.	Ntabwo byari amahirwe na gato kuri we.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
I should have done this better.	Nari nkwiye gukora iki kintu neza.
He should always be ready to work.	Buri gihe agomba kuba yiteguye gukora.
There is so much to do.	Hariho ibintu byinshi byo gukora.
That was hard to beat.	Ibyo byari bigoye gutsinda.
I knew that.	Nari nzi ko.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ni umukobwa mwiza.
He is a wise man, a good man.	Ni umuntu uzi ubwenge, ukora neza.
You are really close by now.	Nukuri uri hafi cyane kugeza ubu.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Time to go again.	Igihe cyo kongera kugenda.
He had a job.	Yari afite akazi.
I guess you want the truth.	Ndakeka ko ushaka ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And he didn't know what to see.	Kandi ntabwo yari azi icyo yari kubona.
My child has problems.	Umwana wanjye afite ibibazo.
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
I would like to have my money.	Ndashaka kubona amafaranga yanjye.
He also had problems on time.	Yagize kandi ibibazo ku gihe.
I need to hear.	Nkeneye kumva.
Behind.	Inyuma.
He should not have said anything.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kugira icyo avuga.
We were friends once.	Twari inshuti rimwe.
We can't do that here.	Ntidushobora kubikora hano.
He was not human.	Ntabwo yari umuntu.
But you have to go now.	Ariko ugomba kugenda ubu.
We have to win.	Tugomba gutsinda.
He was not an actor.	Ntiyari umukinnyi.
He is looking for something.	Arimo gushaka ikintu.
He did not know what was above.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo hejuru.
Inside and out.	Imbere no hejuru.
It was all work.	Byose byari akazi.
He was not sure how.	Ntiyari azi neza uko.
He did not expect this.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ibi.
He was a really good guy.	Yari umusore mwiza rwose.
You have to stop doing this.	Ugomba guhagarika gukora ibi.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
No problem so far.	Nta kibazo kugeza ubu.
This is just a person.	Uyu ni umuntu gusa.
They are out now.	Bari hanze ubu.
There is so much to see.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona.
Just not the same as before.	Gusa ntabwo ari nka mbere.
And to say that this is a problem.	Kandi kuvuga ko iki ari ikibazo.
I'm on top of him.	Ndi hejuru ye.
I was human.	Nari umuntu.
Lots of mistakes.	Amakosa menshi.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
It is very high.	Ari hejuru cyane.
I never saw in him.	Sinigeze mbona muri we.
He is trying to leave.	Arimo kugerageza kugenda.
I can't understand.	Sinshobora kumva.
Stop saying that.	Reka kuvuga ko aribyo.
It is not my family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango wanjye.
He said he was alone.	Yavuze ko yari wenyine.
It was good to do it.	Byari byiza kubikora.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You can be anyone.	Ushobora kuba uwo ari we wese.
He always works hard.	Buri gihe akora cyane.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, mubyukuri sibyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He didn’t have to think about the problem.	Ntabwo yagombaga gutekereza ku kibazo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo aribyo.
Tell me something about that.	Mbwira ikintu kuri ibyo.
Too much thinking.	Gutekereza cyane.
This is not really good at all.	Ibi mubyukuri ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
In the large room there is a telephone.	Mu cyumba kinini hari terefone.
It will be good to wait.	Bizaba byiza gutegereza.
And he was not there.	Kandi ntabwo yari ahari.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
What you have now.	Icyo ufite ubu.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I think that's all.	Ntekereza ko ibyo aribyo byose.
She was also very nice.	Na we yari mwiza rwose.
No one has ever done that.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
But it is a wonderful gift.	Ariko ni impano nziza.
That is every day.	Ibyo ni buri munsi.
They are smart, just like you or me.	Bafite ubwenge, kimwe nawe cyangwa njye.
Today I was in dire need.	Uyu munsi nari nkeneye cyane.
There is, of course, another problem.	Hariho, ikindi, ikindi kibazo.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari gukora nyuma ya byose.
They are good friends.	Ni inshuti nziza.
It could have been.	Yashoboraga kuba.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
Too big, really.	Kinini cyane, mubyukuri.
That's right.	Ibyo ni byo.
Maybe he said it was good enough.	Birashoboka ko yavuze ko byari byiza bihagije.
But that's exactly what you want.	Ariko nibyo ushaka.
He never heard of her leaving.	Ntiyigeze yumva agenda.
He needs money.	Akeneye amafaranga.
You don't have to.	Ntugomba.
He was close.	Yari hafi.
We are here.	Turi hano.
Too much play.	Gukina cyane.
She was so beautiful and so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane kandi mwiza cyane.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Ni byo, ibyo ni ibintu.
I wouldn't do it now.	Ntabwo nari kubikora ubu.
I never got the money to do it.	Sinigeze mbona amafaranga yo kubikora.
Children his age.	Abana imyaka ye.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
She is scared of that.	Afite ubwoba kuri icyo kintu.
As if there was someone downstairs.	Nkaho ahari hari umuntu munsi.
But you have to talk to me.	Ariko ugomba kuvugana nanjye.
There are children.	Hariho abana.
She is just a woman.	Ni umugore gusa.
He must have known something.	Agomba kuba yari azi ikintu.
He doesn’t think about me, or what I need.	Ntatekereza kuri njye, cyangwa ibyo nkeneye.
You want your mistakes and you want them quickly.	Urashaka amakosa yawe kandi urashaka vuba.
You finally did.	Amaherezo wabikoze.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
They have no problem.	Nta kibazo bafite.
But you have to know my position here.	Ariko ugomba kumenya umwanya wanjye hano.
I was on him.	Nari kuri we.
But here.	Ariko hano.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
'	'
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
It would be better than this.	Byaba byiza kuruta ibi.
You may feel like you want to go back.	Urashobora kumva ushaka gusubira inyuma.
That was all there was to it.	Icyo gihe byari byose.
But he knows the same thing.	Ariko azi ikintu kimwe.
Every time he went out to play.	Igihe cyose yagiye hanze gukina.
Especially now.	Cyane cyane ubu.
It was easy, after all.	Byari ibintu byoroshye, nyuma ya byose.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Only.	Gusa.
Much to learn and know.	Byinshi byo kwiga no kumenya.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
We have a plan.	Dufite gahunda.
To do so.	Kubikora.
He has.	Afite.
It was an opportunity he had to take.	Yari amahirwe yagombaga gufata.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza cyane.
He is obviously a young man.	Biragaragara ko ari umusore.
And inside.	Kandi imbere.
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
He is a wise man.	Ni umuntu uzi ubwenge.
He would not have received money for it.	Ntabwo yari kubona amafaranga kuri yo.
I'm not sure they were.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko bari.
You have to eat.	Ugomba kurya.
That's all.	Nibyo gusa.
What did he ask?	Yabajije iki?
But he had none.	Ariko nta na kimwe yari afite.
No one said much.	Nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Up and up.	Hejuru kandi hejuru.
This is good.	Ubu ni byiza.
Definitely, it will be.	Rwose, bizaba.
I feel like a dog.	Numva ari imbwa.
He thought he could stay away.	Yatekereje ko ashobora kuguma kure.
He didn't mean to offend anyone.	Ntiyashakaga kuvuga ku kintu na kimwe.
I hope everything is fine for him.	Nizere ko ibintu byose ari byiza kuri we.
You wouldn't exist.	Ntabwo wari kubaho.
But nothing, nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe, nta kintu na kimwe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
A little down.	Hasi gato.
I'm not here to catch up.	Ntabwo ndi hano gufata.
We have to look at that.	Tugomba kubona kuri ibyo.
Or whatever.	Cyangwa ibyo aribyo byose.
Dogs are not good.	Imbwa ntabwo ari nziza.
Se.	Se.
Everyone who loves something cannot have it.	Umuntu wese akunda ikintu adashobora kugira.
We were outside.	Twari hanze.
I was not sure what to think.	Sinari nzi neza icyo ntekereza.
Here is his wife.	Hano hari umugore we.
It is not as if he is alone.	Ntabwo ari nkaho ari wenyine.
Good dog.	Imbwa nziza.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
But he has to win.	Ariko agomba gutsinda.
Not really tonight.	Mubyukuri ntabwo iri joro.
Someone was here.	Umuntu yari hano.
But he is smart.	Ariko afite ubwenge.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose buri wese muri twe ashobora gusaba.
He didn't think of anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yatekerezaga.
You can see it was easy.	Urashobora kubona byari byoroshye.
If it's not far away, we can go too.	Niba atari kure, dushobora no kugenda.
For the most part, that's exactly what you want.	Ku mpamvu nyinshi, nibyo rwose ushaka.
No one knew why.	Nta n'umwe wari uzi impamvu.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
If it were possible, it would be just one thing.	Niba bishoboka, byari kumva ikintu kimwe gusa.
I mean, chances were.	Ndashaka kuvuga, amahirwe yari ahari.
What he expected.	Ibyo yari yiteze.
And it is my fault.	Kandi ni amakosa yanjye.
But he loves to play.	Ariko akunda gukina.
He is doing everything.	Arimo akora byose.
He thinks a lot.	Yibwira cyane.
He eventually said he would do it.	Amaherezo yavuze ko azabikora.
Or backwards, that's right.	Cyangwa inyuma, nibyo.
That's not to say dogs aren't good enough.	Ntabwo ari uko atari imbwa bihagije.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
One day, he decided to seek more.	Umunsi umwe, yahisemo gushaka byinshi.
It's too high for it, whatever.	Ari hejuru cyane kuri yo, ibyo aribyo byose.
It's great to talk.	Nibyiza cyane no kuvuga.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo ari igihe gito.
He began to feel who he was.	Yatangiye kumva uwo ari we.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
You can't do anything you want here.	Ntushobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose hano.
But he was my son.	Ariko yari umuhungu wanjye.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza cyane kubona.
She is not a girl, she is a boy.	Ntabwo ari umukobwa, ni umuhungu.
That's not what he expected, it's not what he expected.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yiteze, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
Just one thing.	Ikintu kimwe gusa.
Not much to see.	Nta byinshi byo kubona.
But she is just a girl.	Ariko ni umukobwa gusa.
But in doing so he did something.	Ariko mu kubikora yakoze ikintu.
At this point you can't do that.	Iki gihe ntushobora kubikora.
You can take this a little further.	Urashobora gufata iyi kure gato.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Hafi.	Hafi.
In fact, he didn't say much.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yavuze byinshi na gato.
But one has to say.	Ariko umuntu agomba kuvuga.
They were too far away.	Bari kure cyane.
He was not on top.	Ntabwo yari hejuru.
And it was just an opportunity.	Kandi byari amahirwe gusa.
Maybe it was an opportunity.	Ahari byari amahirwe.
Everyone does one thing.	Umwe wese akora umwe.
This is a simple matter.	Ibi ni ibintu byoroshye.
He felt behind her.	Yumvise inyuma ye.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, ni byiza.
This is actually the case.	Ibi mubyukuri.
I like to see early.	Nkunda kubona kare.
You were a young child.	Wari umwana muto.
Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.
There is no one here.	Hano nta muntu wenyine.
Time is of the essence.	Igihe ni ikintu.
He needed this.	Yari akeneye ibi.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, kuri njye.
Eating and drinking.	Kurya no kunywa.
At the time, it was a lot to think about.	Icyo gihe, byari byinshi byo gutekereza.
I don’t want to eat anything, alone.	Ntashaka kurya ikintu, wenyine.
Not a lot of money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga menshi.
He chose to return.	Yahisemo gutaha.
I thought we could play very well.	Natekereje ko dushobora gukina neza cyane.
This is not the case now.	Ubu sibyo.
That was the problem.	Icyo yari ikibazo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That was me.	Uwo yari njye.
He was close.	Yari hafi.
You can also think about it.	Urashobora kandi gutekereza aho.
He had to today.	Yagombaga uyu munsi.
You can learn to do this.	Urashobora kwiga gukora ibi.
One in prison.	Umwe muri gereza.
And he probably did.	Kandi birashoboka ko yabikoze.
Friends are absolutely right.	Inshuti nibyo rwose.
A very talented girl.	Umukobwa ufite impano cyane.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
For us, that was the case.	Kuri twe, ibyo byari byo.
Or go to school or have a job.	Cyangwa kujya mwishuri cyangwa ufite akazi.
Thinking was good.	Gutekereza byari byiza.
Everyone could talk.	Umuntu wese yashoboraga kuvuga.
I had a daughter.	Nari mfite umukobwa.
I want to know anything.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo aricyo cyose.
No phone.	Nta na terefone.
It's something you need to know.	Ni ikintu ukwiye kumenya.
I was the only one.	Nagize umwe wenyine.
Many, many people have these.	Abantu benshi, benshi bafite aba.
It is not a chance.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe.
I have a son.	Mfite umuhungu.
He could have eaten alone easily.	Yashoboraga kurya wenyine byoroshye.
You can, and should, take it.	Urashobora, kandi ugomba, gufata.
People were nearby.	Abantu bari hafi.
Not me at the time.	Ntabwo ari njye icyo gihe.
Now he seemed young.	Ubu yasaga naho ari muto.
She began to feel scared.	Yatangiye kumva afite ubwoba.
This is not the case here.	Hano ntabwo aribyo.
But we don’t have the whole day.	Ariko ntabwo dufite umunsi wose.
It was good to catch.	Byari byiza gufata.
You have to step back.	Niwowe ugomba gusubira inyuma.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
He’s just a guy.	Ni umusore gusa.
About to go upstairs.	Hafi yo kujya hejuru.
I feel bad.	Numva nabi.
He didn't know what to say.	Ntiyari azi icyo avuga.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I'm not sure what he wants.	Ntabwo nzi neza icyo ashaka.
They were all close.	Bose bari hafi.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yari afite ubwoba.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza nonaha, nibyo.
Everyone has their own plan.	Umuntu wese afite gahunda ye.
You are very good.	Ufite neza cyane.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He had a gift for it.	Yari afite impano kuri yo.
He did not know what it was.	Ntiyari azi icyo aricyo.
Buying more is the same.	Kugura byinshi birasa.
He did not want to see.	Ntiyashakaga kubona.
Out on the floor.	Hanze hasi.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
She can't help her hair.	Ntashobora gufasha umusatsi we.
It was not a problem.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo.
But in reality it worked.	Ariko mubyukuri byagenze neza.
I want something.	Ndashaka ikintu.
I shouldn't have read that.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye gusoma ibyo.
They have a daily allowance.	Bafite amafaranga ya buri munsi.
He said it was difficult to do so.	Yavuze nkaho bigoye kubikora.
Another thing.	Ikindi kintu.
But nothing.	Ariko nta na kimwe.
That's great right now.	Nibyiza cyane muri iki gihe.
This is not always true.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari ukuri.
He never heard of her leaving.	Ntiyigeze yumva agenda.
It's much better than normal.	Nibyiza cyane kuruta gukora bisanzwe.
He chose.	Yahisemo.
Probably, maybe.	Birashoboka, birashoboka.
You can't live in this house.	Ntushobora kuba muri iyi nzu.
This if not all.	Ibi niba atari bose.
Sometimes, this is true.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibi ni ukuri.
I may come tonight.	Nshobora kuza muri iri joro.
That would be like him.	Ibyo byaba ari nka we.
You don’t love someone, you don’t really.	Ntabwo ukunda umuntu, ntabwo mubyukuri.
But you don't know anything.	Ariko ntabwo uzi ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I want to do it again soon.	Ndashaka kongera kubikora vuba aha.
We are the only ones upstairs.	Ni twe gusa hejuru.
It was true, and it is true.	Byari ukuri, kandi ni ukuri.
He was ready.	Yari yiteguye.
And he was confident.	Kandi yari yizeye.
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
And, it's not easy.	Kandi, ntabwo byoroshye.
In fact, it is normal.	Nukuri gusa, ni ibintu bisanzwe.
However, this is absolutely possible.	Ariko, ibi birashoboka rwose.
And it was.	Kandi byari byo.
'	'
I don't really know.	Sinzi mubyukuri.
It’s all up to me so far.	Byose ni njye kugeza ubu.
And that's good.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza.
I had a lot to say to everyone.	Nari mfite byinshi byo kubwira abantu bose.
Here it is.	Hano ni se.
But no one has ever done that before.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora mbere.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
We have to say enough.	Tugomba kuvuga bihagije.
And he was right.	Kandi yari afite ukuri.
I mean, it was a lot.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko byari byinshi.
It is not a thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu.
As it is.	Nkuko ari.
I want to.	Ndashaka.
That sounds like a mistake.	Ibyo birasa nkaho ari amakosa.
How to help.	Uburyo bwo gufasha.
And it’s probably easier to walk.	Kandi birashoboka ko byoroshye kugenda.
I heard nothing.	Ntacyo numvise.
He has.	Afite.
That will be enough for each of us.	Ibyo bizaba bihagije kuri buri wese muri twe.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He was a very good child.	Yari umwana mwiza cyane.
I want all of us together.	Ndashaka ko twese hamwe na bose.
I have no faith.	Ntacyo nizera.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
He is behind everything.	Ari inyuma ya buri kintu cyose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
You are a beautiful girl	Uri umukobwa mwiza.
At the moment, he didn't have time.	Kuri ubu, ntabwo yari afite umwanya.
I have to have money.	Ngomba kugira amafaranga.
Being short-lived.	Kuba igihe gito.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
This is a book.	Iki ni igitabo.
The food was good.	Kurya byari byiza.
He says it was my fault.	Avuga ko byari amakosa yanjye.
How he was sitting.	Uburyo yari yicaye.
'	'
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
Everyone has one.	Umuntu wese afite umwe.
He found the door.	Yabonye umuryango.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
He was a young child.	Yari umwana muto.
I'm going to do it all.	Ngiye kujya kubikora twese.
He feels good.	Yumva neza.
And it was really good.	Kandi byari byiza rwose.
Well, try it.	Nibyiza, kugerageza.
Almost there! 	Hafi aho!
However, we can learn more.	Ariko, dushobora kumenya byinshi.
Nothing good to do.	Nta kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
You are thinking about all this badly.	Urimo gutekereza kuri ibi byose nabi.
But he heard someone.	Ariko yumvise umuntu.
I have nothing to do.	Ntacyo mfite cyo gukora.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
But all is not well.	Ariko byose ntabwo ari byiza.
I have a little problem here.	Mfite ikibazo gito hano.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I wanted to be.	Nashakaga kuba.
All together	Byose hamwe.
You know why.	Uzi impamvu.
It's obvious to everyone.	Biragaragara kuri bose.
Lots of reading.	Byinshi byo gusoma.
He was not sure what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo ari cyo.
You can do it yourself.	Urashobora kubikora wenyine.
He saw something.	Yabonye ikintu.
We have so many plans.	Dufite gahunda nyinshi cyane.
.	.
I would be too.	Nanjye nari kuba.
you don't know for sure	ntabwo uzi neza.
I don't need to look at anything.	Ntabwo nkeneye kureba ikintu na kimwe.
In any case, the family is one.	Ibyo ari byo byose, umuryango ni umwe.
Why did he do that.	Kuki yabikoze.
That's right.	Byari byo.
I know the plan.	Nzi gahunda.
Really good so far.	Nibyiza rwose kugeza ubu.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
We were all, if you want to know the truth.	Twese twari, niba ushaka kumenya ukuri.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
More on.	Byinshi Kuri.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo gukora.
It was not far.	Ntiyari kure.
All is well.	Byose byiza cyane.
He knew everything.	Yari azi byose.
He was right, as usual.	Yari afite ukuri, nk'uko bisanzwe.
What should you do? 	Wari ukwiye gukora iki?
He thought.	Yatekereje.
First family.	Umuryango wa mbere.
Wisdom, wisdom, wisdom.	Ubwenge, ubwenge, ubwenge.
He is not very young.	Ntabwo ari muto cyane.
That is clear to us.	Ibyo biragaragara kuri twe.
We were just.	Twari gusa.
Everything is fine, here.	Ibintu byose ni byiza, hano.
We have to eat.	Tugomba kurya.
But he had to go.	Ariko yagombaga kugenda.
But he was ready.	Ariko yari yiteguye.
He never had a problem.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ikibazo.
This is not exactly the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
You can drive.	Urashobora gutwara.
That's really not smart.	Ibyo rwose ntabwo ari ubwenge.
I have to go home.	Ngomba gutaha.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
That's probably not what you want.	Ibyo birashoboka ko atari byo ushaka.
What you knew to be true.	Ibyo wari uzi ko ari ukuri.
He really needed help.	Yari akeneye rwose ubufasha.
He could see that.	Yashoboraga kubona ibyo.
But now he is gone.	Ariko ubu yagiye.
However, the problem is much bigger.	Ariko, ikibazo ni kinini cyane kuruta ibyo.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
I like to work and live and think.	Nkunda gukora no kubaho no gutekereza.
Bottom line is good.	Hasi ni byiza.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
He was never ashamed.	Ntiyigeze agira isoni.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
I was very lucky to stay there.	Nagize amahirwe cyane yo kuguma aho.
And in the end they were right.	Kandi amaherezo bari bafite ukuri.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
That's a long time.	Icyo ni igihe kirekire.
But it was probably good.	Ariko birashoboka ko byari byiza.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
He would have a lot to say.	Yaba afite byinshi byo kuvuga.
Not good, but good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko ni byiza.
You are my friend	Uri inshuti.
That is true today.	Ibyo ni ukuri muri iki gihe.
Sometimes it wasn’t.	Rimwe na rimwe ntiyari.
That's not what he said.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose yavuze.
However, there is a catch.	Ariko, hariho gufata.
I do not believe.	Ntabwo nizera.
He also asked today.	Yabajije kandi uyu munsi.
John is a great expert.	John ni umuhanga cyane.
Outside of you.	Hanze yawe.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
He has a walking problem.	Afite ikibazo cyo kugenda.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It wasn’t much he had to do.	Ntabwo byari byinshi yagombaga gukora.
And something else.	Kandi ikindi kintu.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I can go home.	Nshobora gutaha.
And I can't wait to go back out.	Kandi ntashobora gutegereza gusubira hanze.
Tom can.	Tom arashobora.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
You can't wait to be together all the time.	Ntushobora gutegereza kubana igihe cyose.
You want to help.	Urashaka gufasha.
It would not be difficult to work.	Ntabwo byari kuba bigoye gukora.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
I don't know about that.	Ntacyo nzi kuri ibyo.
I don’t like people in front of me.	Ntabwo nkunda abantu imbere yanjye.
He should not have been there.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kuba ahari.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
My daughter was in it.	Umukobwa wanjye yari arimo.
More to do, less time to do it.	Byinshi byo gukora, umwanya muto wo kubikora.
Above all.	Hanze ya byose.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
That's good! 	Nibyiza!
we have to live together.	tugomba kubana.
I'm not sure about everything.	Ntabwo nzi neza kuri byose.
He did not want to do that.	Ntiyashakaga kubikora.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
Obviously this is a lot.	Biragaragara ko ibi ari byinshi.
Maybe both.	Ahari bombi.
That's not the case now.	Ntabwo aribyo ubu.
I need him to do something.	Nkeneye ko agira icyo akora.
He may also be good.	Ashobora no kuba mwiza.
Whatever he thinks.	Ibyo atekereza byose.
All of that.	Ibyo byose.
Good guy, good guy.	Umusore mwiza, mwiza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He should not be in prison.	Ntagomba kuba muri gereza.
Right now, you have to have a problem.	Kuri ubu, ugomba kubaho ikibazo.
Knowing what to do.	Kumenya icyo agomba gukora.
I didn’t think about all this.	Ntabwo natekereje kuri ibi byose.
You can't speak well.	Ntushobora kuvuga neza.
I think we all have a lot to do.	Ntekereza ko twese dufite byinshi byo gukora.
This is obviously not good.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari byiza.
Everyone has one.	Umuntu wese afite umwe.
It's shopping.	Ni kugura.
He is very.	Ari cyane.
But he seemed smart.	Ariko yasaga naho afite ubwenge.
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
He seemed to enjoy the thing.	Yasaga naho yishimiye icyo kintu.
You, that was a mistake.	Wowe, ibyo byari amakosa.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
I needed someone like him.	Nari nkeneye umuntu nka we.
Apparently, it didn't work out.	Biragaragara, ntabwo byagenze neza.
There is not much you can do.	Nta byinshi ushobora gukora.
But that is not the big problem.	Ariko icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo kinini.
And he.	Na we.
It would be nice.	Byaba ari byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari amakosa.
I guess we should drink later.	Ndakeka ko tugomba kunywa nyuma.
It's really bad.	Ari mubi rwose.
And you have your own house.	Kandi ufite inzu yawe.
You haven't done that before.	Ntabwo wabikoze mbere.
Doing well.	Gukora neza.
For me, it is.	Kuri njye, ni.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I mean, that was great.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibyo byari byiza cyane.
I never thought.	Sinigeze ntekereza.
But here's the thing.	Ariko hano hari ibintu bishoboka.
And that's right now.	Kandi ibyo ni byo kuri ubu.
You can try a little thing.	Urashobora kugerageza kugerageza ikintu gito.
And for that.	Kandi kuri yo.
Really, really.	Nukuri, rwose.
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Birashoboka ko atari ejo, ariko vuba.
He could see everything.	Yashoboraga kubona byose.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
The truth is not what is outside.	Ukuri ntabwo aribyo byari hanze.
Eating too much and drinking.	Kurya cyane no kunywa.
You can do it later.	Urashobora kubikora nyuma.
And it’s not that we were all close.	Kandi ntabwo ari uko twese twari hafi.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
One can have a say.	Umuntu arashobora kugira icyo avuga.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I want to see.	Ndashaka kureba.
Yaba.	Yaba.
It was great to see.	Byari byiza cyane kubona.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That he thought a lot.	Ko yatekereje cyane.
At this time, he was not in his room.	Muri iki gihe, ntabwo yari mu cyumba cye.
It was too far.	Byari kure cyane.
It's a good morning.	Hari mu gitondo cyiza.
He said something.	Hari icyo yavuze.
He had nothing to do with it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite cyo kubikora.
Almost absolutely.	Hafi ya rwose.
Stop that.	Reka ibyo.
It was not a weekly meeting.	Ntabwo yari inama ya buri cyumweru.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
It's been a long time coming.	Hanze igihe kinini.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko turi kare cyane.
The girl is learning.	Umukobwa ni kwiga.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kubona.
He had a plan.	Yari afite gahunda.
It is not your time.	Ntabwo ari umwanya wawe.
And in fact.	Kandi mubyukuri.
I'm bad.	Ndi mubi.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, bari hano, kandi byari hafi.
I always think that.	Buri gihe ntekereza ko.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
He was a thinker.	Yari umuntu utekereza.
He had to leave this room.	Yagombaga kuva muri iki cyumba.
People here.	Abantu hano.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
You have to have a plan.	Ugomba kugira gahunda.
It was outside.	Byari hanze.
The problem is not money.	Ikibazo ntabwo ari amafaranga.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
It is not always easy to know why.	Ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye kumenya impamvu.
It looks bad on the outside.	Birasa nabi hanze.
Maybe everyone.	Ahari bose.
As if not here.	Nkuko atari hano.
But he was very close.	Ariko yari hafi cyane.
Bose.	Bose.
I know it's hard.	Nzi ko bigoye.
I have people like me.	Nagize abantu nkanjye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo iri kure cyane hano.
So much for all of us.	Byinshi kuri twese.
I'm not at work.	Ntabwo ndi ku kazi.
That's good enough for me.	Nibyiza cyane bihagije kuri njye.
But this is good.	Ariko ibi nibyiza.
That was absolutely true.	Ibyo byari ukuri rwose.
I feel scared.	Numva mfite ubwoba.
We were all human beings here.	Twese twari abantu hano.
He didn't know how to drive.	Ntiyari azi gutwara.
This is obviously a very difficult task.	Ibi biragaragara ko bigoye cyane gukora.
I can't say the time.	Sinshobora kuvuga igihe.
How about these two.	Nigute kuri aba bombi.
And he would do what he did well.	Kandi yari gukora ibyo yakoze byiza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
And he could have been with me.	Kandi yashoboraga kubana nanjye.
But whatever it is right now.	Ariko ibyo aribyo byose kuri ubu.
And they were right.	Kandi bari bafite ukuri.
That's all he needed to know.	Ibyo aribyo byose yari akeneye kumenya.
Or even outside of it.	Cyangwa no hanze ye.
There is one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hafi ya byose.
If not.	Niba atari byo.
Or maybe just kids.	Cyangwa ahari abana gusa.
I just thought you should know.	Gusa natekereje ko ugomba kumenya.
But things went wrong.	Ariko ibintu byagenze nabi.
I wanted more for him.	Nashakaga byinshi kuri we.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I don't have to do this.	Ntabwo ngomba gukora ibi.
It was easy to see.	Byari byoroshye kubona.
It would be nice to have one day.	Byaba byiza umunsi umwe.
I can't even talk to her.	Sinshobora no kuvugana na we.
Alone to hear alone.	Wenyine kumva wenyine.
Travel time.	Igihe cyo kugenda.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
He would have gone.	Yaba yagiye.
He tried to think about what he was saying.	Yagerageje gutekereza ku cyo avuga.
I was not sure.	Sinari nzi neza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He did.	Yakoze.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
He needs help here.	Arashaka ubufasha hano.
If not your wife.	Niba atari umugore wawe.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
He had high expectations.	Yari yiteze byinshi.
That is not the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
He does nothing.	Ntacyo akora.
They weren't going to leave.	Ntabwo bari kugenda.
Everything.	Byose.
I don’t always know why.	Ntabwo buri gihe nzi impamvu.
It would not help anything.	Ntabwo byari gufasha ikintu na kimwe.
We have time.	Dufite umwanya.
The fact that he was in the room, that's right.	Kuba yari mu cyumba, nibyo.
Doing the day.	Gukora umunsi.
Someone was there.	Umuntu yari ahari.
He had no job.	Nta kazi yari afite.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Smart people.	Abantu bafite ubwenge.
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
I don't want to try again.	Sinshaka kongera kugerageza.
He did.	Yabikoze.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
I would do it.	Nari kubikora.
You need to know all this.	Ugomba kumenya ibi byose.
But he probably didn't.	Ariko birashoboka ko atari kubikora.
That is something else.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu.
He had to think for himself.	Yagombaga gutekereza wenyine.
We weren’t, really.	Ntabwo twari turi, mubyukuri.
It was easy with him.	Byari byoroshye na we.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Someone needed to see it.	Hariho umuntu yari akeneye kubona.
The one you want is high.	Uwo ushaka ni hejuru.
Mary was not the only girl.	Mariya ntabwo yari umukobwa umwe.
We need to know that.	Tugomba kumenya uko.
I really want to.	Ndashaka cyane.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
Or he wasn't.	Cyangwa ntiyari.
They have one younger son.	Bafite umuhungu umwe muto.
Your hair.	Umusatsi wawe.
He has now.	Ubu afite.
He tried everything.	Yagerageje byose.
It's us.	Ni twe.
He would not have been here for a long time.	Ntabwo yari kuba hano igihe kirekire.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I have never heard of this.	Sinigeze numva ibi.
Only, and everything would be fine.	Gusa, kandi ibintu byose byaba byiza.
One.	Kimwe.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
It is not a thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu.
I can't stay here.	Sinshobora kuguma hano.
And, he was here.	Kandi, yari hano.
He could see everything.	Yashoboraga kubona byose.
I like to play.	Nkunda gukina.
If not, he would not eat.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo yari kurya.
House.	Inzu.
They are all in jail.	Bose bari muri gereza.
I'm really good	Ndi mwiza mubyukuri.
I'm not going to do that.	Ntabwo ngiye kubikora.
Until the day	Kugeza umunsi.
Everything was easy.	Byose byari byoroshye.
He was here, whatever.	Yari hano, ibyo aribyo byose.
You can't be close.	Ntushobora kuba hafi.
He is the only one.	Niwe wenyine.
But no.	Ariko nta.
When is the problem, not if.	Ni ryari ikibazo, ntabwo niba.
He said that at any time.	Yavuze ko igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
That's exactly what I meant.	Nukuri icyo nashakaga kuvuga.
Whatever he has.	Ikintu cyose yaba afite.
But she would be a good woman.	Ariko yari kuba umugore mwiza.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
And I can't.	Kandi ntashobora.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
It was too high.	Byari hejuru cyane.
It's almost there.	Hafi gato.
Someone you know or know.	Umuntu uzi cyangwa uzi.
I saw it nearby.	Nabonye hafi.
You are looking back while.	Urimo kureba inyuma mugihe.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He could have.	Yashoboraga kugira.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Tell me anything.	Mbwira ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
He has a good family.	Afite umuryango mwiza.
Here we are.	Ni hano.
I can see nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora kubona.
They knew he was out.	Bari bazi ko ari hanze.
You really wouldn't be.	Ntabwo rwose wari kuba.
I thought about it all.	Natekereje kuri byose.
That's not a problem for him.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri we.
However, it is also true.	Ariko, ni ukuri kandi.
Not until you go.	Ntabwo kugeza igihe ugiye.
They have a daughter.	Bafite umukobwa.
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
All right, but it's true.	Byose, ariko ni ukuri.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
I hadn't thought about that.	Sinari natekereje kuri ibyo.
And of course it is possible.	Kandi rwose birashoboka.
It's too far.	Ni kure cyane.
He went.	Yagiye.
One question, one idea.	Ikibazo kimwe, igitekerezo.
He would have nothing else to do.	Ntabwo yari kugira ikindi akora.
That was all.	Ibyo byari byose.
Yes, there is no reason to back down.	Nibyo, nta mpamvu yo gusubira inyuma.
It's not like we were human.	Ntabwo ari nkaho twari abantu.
But it’s a big deal.	Ariko ni ikintu kinini.
And he was alone.	Kandi yari wenyine.
It is not difficult to understand why.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane kumva impamvu.
.	.
I have a house.	Mfite inzu.
He didn't want to wait.	Ntiyashakaga gutegereza.
It was not a concern.	Ntabwo byari impungenge.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
We have the best food we have.	Dufite ibiryo byiza cyane dufite.
I had the money.	Nari mfite amafaranga.
I have no job.	Nta kazi mfite.
This was his man.	Uyu yari umuntu we.
No need to be scared.	Nta mpamvu yo kugira ubwoba.
The car was not moving.	Imodoka ntiyari kugenda.
The truth.	Ukuri.
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
Not here or here today.	Ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano muri iki gihe.
You know we're all eating.	Uzi ko twese turi kurya.
He had seen it before.	Yabonye mbere.
He wanted to do something.	Yashakaga kugira icyo akora.
I wanted to get out of the movie.	Nashakaga kuva muri firime.
Really close to me.	Nukuri hafi yanjye.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu ntabwo yari yatekereje.
Absolutely.	Nukuri mubyukuri.
She was beautiful too.	Na we yari mwiza.
You have one child.	Ufite umwana umwe.
We have a lot of that here, in fact.	Dufite byinshi muri byo hano, mubyukuri.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
And all.	Kandi byose.
We are many.	Turi benshi.
This is really a movie to watch.	Iyi rwose ni firime yo kureba.
Really me.	Nukuri njye.
But, if he had gone.	Ariko, niba yari yagiye.
He wanted to say something else.	Yashakaga kuvuga ikindi.
There is a problem.	Hariho ikibazo.
He really didn't need to buy anything else.	Ntabwo rwose yari akeneye kugura ikindi.
But he seems to be worried.	Ariko asa naho afite impungenge.
I hear that all the time.	Numva ibyo igihe cyose.
He heard something.	Yumvise ikintu.
As a child he was close to her.	Akiri umwana yari hafi ye.
No one was outside.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hanze.
But he is.	Ariko ni we.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I know how to do good.	Nzi gukora ikintu cyiza.
Lots of cars.	Imodoka nyinshi.
What did he have to do to do all this?	Ni iki yari afite cyo gukora ibi byose.
I just thought that.	Gusa natekereje ko.
Well, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Nibyo, nta kintu cyiza yari afite cyo gukora.
That's exactly what we have to do.	Nibyo rwose tugomba gukora.
She heard swimming.	Yumvise koga.
He needs good things.	Akeneye ibintu byiza.
He went to it.	Yagiye kuri yo.
He said nothing wrong.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze nabi.
Apparently he didn't.	Biragaragara ko atabikoze.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Everything was easy.	Byose byari byoroshye.
They were then.	Icyo gihe bari.
It's good, simple and easy.	Nibyiza, byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
He chose to do so.	Yahisemo ko bishoboka.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ariko birashoboka gato cyane.
I didn't have that problem.	Ntabwo nagize icyo kibazo.
Only one person.	Umuntu umwe gusa.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He knows she is.	Azi ko ari we.
He was also dressed.	Yari yambaye kandi.
Tell me what to do.	Mbwira icyo gukora.
But all together.	Ariko byose hamwe.
Today,.	Muri iki gihe,.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
I can do it.	Nshobora kubikora.
Capture and capture.	Gufata no gufata.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
She is ashamed and beautiful.	Afite isoni kandi ni mwiza.
I believe he should be there.	Nizera ko agomba kuba ahari.
More than friends.	Kurenza inshuti.
I have to go quickly.	Ngomba kugenda vuba.
But everything was true.	Ariko ibintu byose byari ukuri.
But in the short term.	Ariko mugihe gito.
I don't want this.	Sinshaka ibi.
Yes, it was easy.	Nibyo, byari byoroshye.
Tell me when.	Mbwira igihe.
But I think it was.	Ariko mbona ko byari.
There is only one other thing.	Hariho ikindi kintu kimwe gusa.
You do nothing.	Ntacyo ukora.
Is that why he was?	Ni yo mpamvu yari we?.
He enjoyed the thing.	Yishimiye icyo kintu.
He said everything he knew.	Yavuze ibyo yari azi byose.
He has to think.	Agomba gutekereza.
I am proud of the work he has done.	Nishimiye akazi yakoze.
But there is a problem with that.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kuri ibyo.
It is not easy at all.	Ntabwo byoroshye rwose.
Wise, but good.	Ubwenge, ariko nibyiza.
I like to have that problem.	Nkunda kugira icyo kibazo.
Sometimes it’s money.	Rimwe na rimwe ni amafaranga.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ikibazo mbere ya.
I have a lot of that.	Mfite byinshi muri byo.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
He wanted to try something else.	Yashakaga kugerageza ikindi kintu.
You know we can.	Uzi ko dushobora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko twari dufite ibintu byinshi cyane.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
It's good, it's easy, just do it.	Nibyiza, byoroshye, kubikora gusa.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
In fact, everything is fine.	Mubyukuri, ibintu byose ni byiza.
He did not know why he was expecting something else.	Ntiyari azi impamvu yari yiteze ikindi kintu.
The boy was worried, he had a reason.	Umuhungu yari afite impungenge, afite impamvu.
He has.	Afite.
I have someone.	Mfite umuntu.
That's not the problem.	Icyo si ikibazo.
They know for sure that it is easy.	Bazi neza ko byoroshye.
But far from it.	Ariko kure cyane.
He thought that would happen.	Yatekereje ko ibyo byari kubaho.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntacyo aribyo.
I desperately need help.	Ndashaka cyane ubufasha.
I always think.	Ntekereza buri gihe.
I'm not sure who he is.	Ntabwo nzi neza uwo ari we.
And indeed.	Kandi rwose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yamaze gukora.
One could stay for a while.	Umuntu yashoboraga kuguma igihe gito.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko byari byiza.
Sometimes, it is possible.	Rimwe na rimwe, birashoboka.
There is a lot to play together.	Hariho byinshi byo gukina hamwe.
He needed to eat something.	Yari akeneye kurya ikintu.
They would both do it.	Bombi bari kubikora.
You have to take the bus.	Ugomba kugenda kuri bisi.
He knew he would do it.	Yari azi ko azabikora.
They know you know the truth.	Bazi ko uzi ukuri.
They are all numerous here.	Bose ni benshi hano.
Not a good day.	Ntabwo ari umunsi mwiza.
It would be nice though.	Byaba byiza ariko.
He has nothing.	Ntacyo afite.
You can stay here tonight.	Urashobora kuguma hano muri iri joro.
You have to be good.	Ugomba kuba mwiza.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
We have no money.	Ntabwo dufite amafaranga.
It's not a movie.	Ntabwo ari firime.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
Easy to find.	Kubona byoroshye.
You can't find many here.	Ntushobora kubona benshi hano.
I was just young.	Nari muto gusa.
As good as it gets.	Nkuko ari byiza.
And that's all he knows.	Kandi ibyo nibyo azi gusa.
I didn’t get a chance to find out more.	Ntabwo nabonye umwanya wo kubona byinshi.
I have to leave your beautiful house.	Ngomba kureka inzu yawe nziza.
I mean you have a plan.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko ufite gahunda.
A player can win money.	Umukinnyi ashobora gutsinda amafaranga.
He is or.	Ari cyangwa.
Who knew he had.	Ninde wari uzi ko afite.
You have	Ufite.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
He knew what he was feeling.	Yari azi icyo yumva.
That's right- this is not about me.	Ntabwo aribyo, ntabwo aribyo.
I think he can do it.	Ntekereza ko ashobora kubikora.
Everyone here.	Umuntu wese uri hano.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
But we are.	Ariko turi.
We can't say enough about this.	Ntidushobora kuvuga ibi bihagije.
She was looking for a baby.	Yashakaga umwana.
It's morning.	Hari mu gitondo.
The book is great.	Igitabo ni cyiza.
But how about every day.	Ariko nigute buri munsi.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
It's been a long time coming.	Yagiye igihe kirekire.
You think you can do anything you want.	Uratekereza ko ushobora gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose ushaka.
Trying and doing things right.	Kugerageza no gukora ibintu neza.
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
So far, very low.	Kugeza ubu, hasi cyane.
People you think.	Abantu utekereza.
What he had to do.	Icyo yagombaga gukora.
My daughter is very lucky.	Umukobwa wanjye afite amahirwe menshi.
He may be.	Ashobora kuba.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I needed to get out soon.	Nari nkeneye kuva hanze vuba.
I'm not sure.	Ntazi neza.
You have to have something when you need money.	Ugomba kugira ikintu mugihe ukeneye amafaranga.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
She needs to talk to me.	Akeneye kuvugana nanjye.
What the child wanted was us.	Ikintu umwana yashakaga ni twe.
He should be here soon.	Agomba kuba hano vuba.
He told me he was.	Yambwiye ko ari.
That’s a great idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo kinini.
I can't do it right.	Sinshobora kubikora neza.
He asked a question.	Yabajije ikibazo.
You can't speak well.	Ntushobora kuvuga neza.
It was a mistake from the beginning.	Byari amakosa kuva mbere.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I’m not just this world.	Ntabwo ndi iyi si gusa.
That would be enough.	Byaba bihagije.
I wanted to be a teacher.	Nashakaga kuba umwarimu.
I am thirty years old.	Mfite imyaka mirongo itatu.
Everything he does he does very well.	Ikintu cyose akora akora cyiza cyane.
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
I was well aware, however.	Nari nzi neza, ariko.
You have to live well.	Ugomba kubaho neza.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
She has a child.	Afite umwana.
We don't need much.	Nta byinshi dukeneye.
This, too, was a mistake.	Ibi na byo byari amakosa.
At the time, he appeared to be very young.	Icyo gihe yasaga naho ari muto cyane.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
I have a small problem.	Mfite ikibazo gito.
And that is not the case.	Kandi icyo atari cyo.
The request was successful.	Gusaba byagenze neza.
If so, that's fine.	Niba aribyo, nibyiza.
I have many, many gifts.	Mfite impano nyinshi, nyinshi.
You are not seeing.	Ntabwo urimo kubona.
He needed a lot of time.	Yari akeneye igihe kinini.
It's time.	Yaje igihe.
And a really nice person.	Kandi umuntu mwiza rwose.
And it was really good, and definitely possible.	Kandi byari byiza rwose, kandi birashoboka rwose.
Inside us.	Imbere muri twe.
He did not know where he was.	Ntiyari azi aho ari.
One does not think it is possible but it was.	Umuntu ntatekereza ko bishoboka ariko yari.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Good driving day.	Umunsi mwiza wo gutwara.
Today.	Uyu munsi.
But it was good for me.	Ariko yari mwiza kuri njye.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
You want something very bad.	Urashaka ikintu kibi cyane.
And you have to come.	Kandi ugomba kuza.
They know people.	Bazi abantu.
One hair.	Umusatsi umwe.
He was his master.	Yari umuhanga we.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
Either way he couldn’t go.	Ibyo ari byo byose ntabwo yashoboraga kugenda.
Sometimes it is very possible.	Rimwe na rimwe birashoboka cyane.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
We only have one thing.	Dufite ikintu gusa.
Apparently it was his fault.	Biragaragara ko ari amakosa ye.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
It was not possible.	Ntabwo byari bishoboka.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
What he could do.	Ibyo yashoboraga gukora.
But no one said it was.	Ariko nta muntu wavuze ko aribyo.
It was not easy.	Ntabwo byari byoroshye.
He said it was good.	Yavuze ko ari byiza.
That's not the case now.	Ntabwo aribyo ubu.
The food was really good, however, it was good.	Ibiryo byari byiza rwose, ariko, byari byiza.
No one knew who he was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi uwo ari we.
He is eating.	Arimo kurya.
You are doing it.	Urimo kubikora.
He said he was gone.	Yavuze ko yagiye.
But none of us.	Ariko nta n'umwe muri twe.
This was not true.	Ibi ntabwo byari ukuri.
And we were friends.	Kandi twari inshuti.
I don't know what happened.	Sinzi uko byagenze.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He is my son.	Ni umuhungu wanjye.
To me all that is outside.	Kuri njye ibyo byose ni hanze.
He has.	Afite.
Probably both.	Birashoboka ko bombi ari bombi.
He did a lot.	Yakoze byinshi.
He talked about swimming.	Yavuze ku koga.
It was just a matter of time.	Icyo gihe byari ikibazo gusa.
That's almost all.	Ibyo ni hafi ya byose.
Everyone wants children.	Umuntu wese arashaka abana.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
You want to quit.	Urashaka kureka.
And he was right about a lot.	Kandi yari afite ukuri kuri byinshi.
Maybe both together.	Ahari bombi hamwe.
I really like it.	Nkunda rwose.
You can get out of this.	Urashobora kuva muri ibi.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
In fact, there is no waiting.	Mubyukuri, nta no gutegereza.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He wasn't sure if it was good.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ari byiza.
He never wanted to get married.	Ntabwo yigeze yifuza gushaka.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
You are a beautiful girl	Uri umukobwa mwiza.
There are so many.	Hariho benshi cyane.
From your phone.	Kuva kuri terefone yawe.
He was one person.	Yari umuntu umwe.
I would do anything to come home.	Nari gukora ikintu cyose cyo gutaha.
It’s not always easy to do.	Ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye gukora.
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
I was not lucky.	Ntabwo nagize amahirwe.
One.	Kimwe.
I can carry nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gutwara.
He loved the book.	Yakundaga igitabo.
Someone is behind me.	Hariho umuntu nyuma yanjye.
But it seems like you know something.	Ariko birasa nkaho uzi ikintu.
And there is something else.	Kandi hariho ikindi kintu kimwe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
He feels very far away.	Yumva ari kure cyane.
We were all scared.	Twese twari dufite ubwoba.
I don’t think he knew.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko yamenye.
He was not here.	Ntabwo yari hano.
Mary was right.	Mariya yari afite ukuri.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He loved this.	Yakundaga ibi.
You don’t have to do too many things.	Ntugomba gukora ibintu byinshi cyane.
Everyone has problems.	Umuntu wese afite ibibazo.
Tell me everything	Mbwira byose.
We can't do that.	Ntidushobora kubikora.
And after him.	Nawe nyuma ye.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
After all.	Nyuma ya byose.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari muri we wenyine.
Many friends.	Inshuti nyinshi.
It's good when it's good.	Nibyiza iyo ari byiza.
The reason is money.	Impamvu ni amafaranga.
I saw the same.	Nabonye kimwe.
He thought of the child.	Yatekereje umwana.
Not now.	Ntabwo ubu.
We just have to know.	Tugomba kumenya gusa.
They would do nothing.	Ntacyo bari gukora.
They were not always the same.	Ntabwo buri gihe bari ikintu kimwe.
I have nothing.	Ntacyo ndimo.
It's not really money.	Mubyukuri ntabwo ari amafaranga.
You know he has problems.	Uzi ko afite ibibazo.
I'm sure there is something.	Nzi neza ko hari ikintu.
I never had to do that before.	Sinigeze ngomba kubikora mbere.
You have a lot to do.	Ufite byinshi byo gukora.
I'm out here.	Ndi hanze aha.
Maybe you like it too.	Birashoboka ko nawe ukunda.
My wife.	Umugore wanjye.
He gave each of us.	Yahaye umwe wese muri twe.
There is no reason to do that.	Nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
There are many like me here.	Hano hari benshi nkanjye.
We need to eat more.	Tugomba kurya byinshi.
He didn't like it.	Ntabwo yakundaga.
I hope you can live with that.	Nizere ko ushobora kubana nibyo.
And it's something.	Kandi ni ikintu.
I have my family near me.	Mfite umuryango wanjye hafi yanjye.
It's your fault.	Ni amakosa yawe.
He says nothing.	Nta cyo avuga.
All of this was too much.	Ibi byose byari byinshi cyane.
And we are friends and we are all.	Kandi turi inshuti kandi twese.
I feel very bad.	Ndumva cyane.
This one was not the same.	Uyu na we ntiyari uwo.
If not time to dump her.	Niba atari igihe cyo kureka.
For him, he is right.	Kuri we, afite ukuri.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
I hope he has.	Ndizera ko afite.
He went first.	Yagiye mbere.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari kuri we.
I worked hard on that.	Nakoze cyane kuri icyo kintu.
You can talk to him.	Urashobora kuvugana na we.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
To this day.	Kugeza uyu munsi.
We are not afraid.	Ntabwo dufite ubwoba.
You have to wait a long time.	Ufite gutegereza igihe kirekire.
I thought of him.	Natekereje kuri we.
Not much tonight.	Ntabwo ari byinshi muri iri joro.
I want to talk to him.	Ndashaka kuvugana na we.
I have a lot of problems.	Mfite ibibazo byinshi.
Time to work.	Igihe cyo gukora.
He thought there was a chance.	Yatekereje ko hari amahirwe.
He didn't seem to mind.	Ntabwo yasaga naho aribyo byose.
There is today.	Hariho uyu munsi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari ukuri.
He didn't need anything.	Nta na kimwe yari akeneye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari ni impungenge.
I'm happy with everything.	Nishimiye byose.
Apparently not him.	Biragaragara ko atari we.
I have never heard of this.	Sinigeze numva ibi.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
He was not expecting anyone.	Ntabwo yari yiteze umuntu.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
He was skilled and efficient.	Yari umuhanga kandi akora neza.
I always want something.	Ndashaka ikintu buri gihe.
Here we are.	Hano turi.
If not, he was close.	Niba atari byo, yari hafi.
All of this we can do.	Ibi byose dushobora gukora.
I feel nothing, I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva, ntacyo numva.
He was young, probably 20 years old.	Yari muto, birashoboka ko afite imyaka 20.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byose byari byiza.
He could do anything, to anyone, anytime.	Yashoboraga gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose, ku muntu uwo ari we wese, igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
In fact, you are bad.	Mubyukuri, uri mubi.
I never wanted to.	Sinigeze nshaka.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
You are not at home too early.	Ntabwo uri murugo kare cyane.
She was good enough.	Yari mwiza bihagije.
I want to try this.	Ndashaka kugerageza ibi.
My son is a good and beautiful boy.	Umuhungu wanjye ni umuhungu mwiza kandi mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But very good.	Ariko byiza cyane.
He can defeat anyone.	Arashobora gutsinda umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I really don't like it.	Ntabwo rwose nkunda.
This is not a movie.	Iyi ntabwo ari firime.
This is what you need to look for in the future.	Ibi nibyo ugomba kureba imbere.
He saw nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yabonye.
He can do anything you can think of.	Arashobora gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose ushobora gutekereza.
It was late.	Byari nyuma.
Absolutely this.	Ibi rwose.
More than most people.	Kurenza abantu benshi.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
I think he can too.	Ndatekereza ko nawe ashobora.
Stop reading.	Reka gusoma.
Or you can just overcome the problems.	Cyangwa urashobora gutsinda ibibazo gusa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
His father was nearby.	Se yari hafi.
He thought outside.	Yatekereje hanze.
Bomb, bomb.	Bombi, bombi.
And that's what we have to do.	Kandi nibyo tugomba gukora.
I didn’t know anything at the time and under the first one.	Ntacyo nari nzi icyo gihe kandi munsi ya mbere.
I had to help.	Nari ngomba gufasha.
Things are good.	Ibintu ni byiza.
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
We needed to talk about what to do.	Twari dukeneye kuvuga kubyo gukora.
They were scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
But now you are in prison.	Ariko ubu uri muri gereza.
That's right here.	Nibyo rwose hano.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekerezaga.
I knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe nari nzi.
And he was probably right.	Kandi birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
But that's what he looked like.	Ariko nibyo yasaga nkanjye.
Everything is true.	Ibintu byose ni ukuri.
I have to go to this meeting.	Ngomba kujya muri iyi nama.
I don't work in prison.	Ntabwo nkora muri gereza.
This is not exactly the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba byiza.
You're going to get this.	Ugiye kubona ibi.
You have to find someone.	Ugomba kubona umuntu.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Yari azi uko byari kugenda.
And so far, so good.	Kandi kugeza ubu, ni byiza cyane.
We are on top.	Turi hejuru.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
This is true and this is me.	Ibi ni ukuri kandi uyu ni njye.
.	.
But luckily, not like me.	Ariko ufite amahirwe, ntabwo nkanjye.
But it’s something to think about a lot.	Ariko ni ikintu cyo gutekereza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Or maybe he'll be ready to talk.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko azaba yiteguye kuvuga.
He went back.	Yagiye inyuma.
He could be a very bad person.	Ashobora kuba umuntu mubi cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I'm very worried.	Mfite impungenge nyinshi.
You can also do it at the same time.	Urashobora kandi kubikora mugihe kimwe.
That's right.	Nibyo.
All alone.	Byose wenyine.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
I want to go now.	Ndashaka kugenda ubu cyane.
Where the child went.	Aho umwana yagiye.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
That's what his father loved so much.	Nibyo se yakundaga cyane.
He was a very handsome young man.	Yari umusore mwiza cyane.
It’s just a car, but it’s a good car.	Ni imodoka gusa, ariko ni imodoka nziza.
But obviously this is not a problem.	Ariko biragaragara ko iki atari ikibazo.
You have something.	Ufite ikintu.
You can't do it alone.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine.
Only one young man had done so.	Umusore umwe gusa ni we wari wabikoze.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
And there is money.	Kandi hariho amafaranga.
But he would do it.	Ariko yari kubikora.
But in reality everything.	Ariko mubyukuri byose.
I can't look away.	Sinshobora kureba kure.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
I want to be close to you.	Ndashaka kuba hafi yawe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I did not know.	Ntabwo nari nzi.
He is a good child.	Ni umwana mwiza.
But he was not alone.	Ariko ntabwo yari we wenyine.
It will be good in the end.	Bizaba byiza amaherezo.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
Very good if.	Nibyiza cyane niba.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That’s why he thought of driving.	Ni yo mpamvu yatekereje gutwara.
Not very good, this one.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane, iyi.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
No one had done it before.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari wabikoze mbere.
He can do it now, do it here.	Ashobora kubikora nonaha, kubikora hano.
He was a very bad man.	Yari umuntu mubi cyane.
We have to learn.	Tugomba kwiga.
I can only do things, very quickly.	Nshobora gukora ibintu gusa, vuba cyane.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
It's not far from here.	Ntabwo ari kure hano.
And there I am.	Kandi hariho njye.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Ntabwo nakoze ikintu kibi.
So far, so good, man.	Kugeza ubu, byiza cyane, muntu.
He thought on time.	Yatekereje ku gihe.
I want to be on top.	Ndashaka kuba hejuru.
He could wait close.	Yashoboraga gutegereza hafi.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Ibyo byagenze nta kuvuga.
You’ve got to do a lot of things.	Wabonye gukora ibintu byinshi.
If he was going.	Niba yari kugenda.
No schedule, time.	Nta gahunda, igihe.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
We all have.	Twese dufite.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He thinks nothing of it.	Nta kintu na kimwe atekereza.
There is a lot of money here.	Hano hari amafaranga menshi.
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
I think it would be better for that.	Ndatekereza ko byaba byiza kuri ibyo.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
That would only be a problem.	Ibyo byaba ari ikibazo gusa.
It was better than me, better than me.	Byari byiza kundusha, kundusha.
I just did wrong.	Gusa nakoze nabi.
He thought all of that was good.	Yatekereje ko ibyo byose byari byiza.
Everyone was down.	Abantu bose bari hasi.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
But it is my fault.	Ariko ni amakosa yanjye.
The money was there.	Amafaranga yari ahari.
Not everyone has a party.	Ntabwo abantu bose bafite ibirori.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
You may be doing something really bad.	Urashobora kuba mubyukuri ukora ikintu kibi cyane.
Maybe they’re just scared.	Birashoboka ko bafite ubwoba gusa.
But you can.	Ariko urashobora.
I had the same problem.	Nanjye nari mfite ikibazo kimwe.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
Reka.	Reka.
But he probably didn't.	Ariko birashoboka ko atabikoze.
You may not be thirty years old.	Ntushobora kuba ufite imyaka mirongo itatu.
However, it is not the same.	Ariko, ntabwo ari kimwe.
He can't do that.	Ntashobora gukora ibyo.
He didn't even understand.	Ntiyari no kumva.
He loved gifts.	Yakundaga impano.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It's me or you.	Ari njye cyangwa wowe.
Until that day it would have remained as usual.	Kugeza uwo munsi byari kuguma nkuko bisanzwe.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo byose ntabwo aribyo.
Many.	Benshi.
Obviously you can do that.	Biragaragara ko ushobora kubikora.
I need a friend	Nkeneye inshuti.
And once.	Kandi rimwe.
I think maybe that's the problem.	Ntekereza ko ahari aricyo kibazo.
But the same.	Ariko kimwe.
There are many who have this problem.	Hariho benshi bafite iki kibazo.
He came to us.	Yaje kuri twe.
This one really.	Uyu rwose.
Meal time	Igihe cyo kurya.
At the moment things are not going well.	Kuri ubu ibintu ntabwo ari byiza.
Bad position.	Umwanya mubi.
Who are you	Ninde uri.
He is not like him.	Ntabwo ari nka we.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Nzi neza ko bizaba byiza.
I didn’t think things through.	Ntabwo natekerezaga ibintu.
For me, it was so beautiful.	Kuri njye, yari mwiza cyane.
Many are nearby.	Benshi ni hafi.
That's right, for me.	Nibyo, kuri njye.
Eventually, he said.	Amaherezo, yavuze.
Only one said.	Umwe gusa ni we wavuze.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
He knew the time was short.	Yari azi ko igihe ari gito.
It’s not just me, me, me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa, njye, njye.
I shouldn't have done that.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kubikora.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Father's house	Inzu ya se.
You can easily see where you are.	Urashobora kubona byoroshye aho uri.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He knew he had the truth.	Yari azi ko afite ukuri.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
But none of us know what tomorrow is.	Ariko nta numwe muri twe uzi ejo icyo aricyo.
He knew his father.	Yari azi se.
He was probably a bad person.	Birashoboka ko yari umuntu mubi.
He has a daughter.	Afite umukobwa.
Not too much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi cyane.
I was out all day.	Nari hanze umunsi wose.
He asked where he was.	Yabajije aho ari.
It's not a job.	Ntabwo ari akazi.
He was looking bad.	Yashakaga nabi.
You would think.	Wari gutekereza.
Children at school.	Abana ku ishuri.
Very good stuff.	Ibintu byiza cyane.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo.
I have the same idea.	Mfite igitekerezo kimwe.
So much for that.	Ikintu cyane kugeza aho.
Money or.	Amafaranga cyangwa.
He went outside, but found nothing.	Yagiye hanze, ariko ntacyo yabonye.
Eating good food.	Kurya ibiryo byiza.
Or maybe it's not true.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari nukuri.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I thought.	Natekereje.
He was a hard worker.	Yari umuntu ukora cyane.
Since then things have been going well.	Kuva icyo gihe ibintu byagenze neza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo rwose ntabwo aribyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
That's right, you too.	Nibyo, nawe.
He was very embarrassed about that.	Yari afite isoni nyinshi kuri ibyo.
He has.	Afite.
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
I had no money.	Ntabwo nari mfite amafaranga.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
I got back to work now.	Nabonye gusubira ku kazi ubu.
And he tried to do something.	Kandi yagerageje kugira icyo akora.
He was thinking ahead.	Yari imbere atekereza.
We can't think straight.	Ntidushobora gutekereza neza.
He will be here today.	Azaba hano muri iki gihe.
He is working on that.	Arimo gukora kuri ibyo.
This was my new home.	Iyi yari inzu yanjye nshya.
It was advice.	Byari inama.
This is not the time to be ashamed.	Iki ntabwo aricyo gihe cyo kugira isoni.
Bad people.	Abantu mubi.
As if he was doing it.	Nkaho arimo kubikora.
But that is not the case today.	Ariko ntabwo byagenze iki gihe.
Of course, that's exactly what his wife wants.	Nukuri, nibyo nibyo umugore we ashaka.
When?	Ni ryari.
One can see what he means.	Umuntu arashobora kubona icyo ashaka kuvuga.
But it is not a movie.	Ariko ntabwo ari firime.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
I work hard.	Nkora cyane.
Apparently he didn't.	Biragaragara ko atabikoze.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari azi.
You are my family, I love you.	Uri umuryango wanjye, nkunda.
As usual.	Nkuko bisanzwe.
I was young.	Nari muto.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
In any case, we have no reason to do so.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta mpamvu dufite yo kubikora.
They would both work.	Bombi bari gukora.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
Sometimes, that is true.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibyo ni ukuri.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I'm not leaving.	Ntabwo ndimo kugenda.
Just for him.	Gusa kuri we.
Not a bad time.	Ntabwo ari umwanya mubi.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
Or the same.	Cyangwa kimwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I think he wants to talk to me alone.	Ntekereza ko ashaka kuvugana nanjye wenyine.
He didn't have to tell anyone.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubwira umuntu.
I want to think.	Ndashaka gutekereza.
As if he didn’t want me to see inside.	Nkaho adashaka ko mbona imbere.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Lots.	Byinshi.
He is doing things on his own.	Arimo akora ibintu wenyine.
Just work.	Akazi gusa.
Everything went well.	Byose byagenze neza.
'	'
And let it be.	Reka kandi.
But going would be a mistake.	Ariko kugenda byaba ari amakosa.
She is happy to take you to school.	Yishimiye kujyana nawe ku ishuri.
I would do anything.	Nari gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
I saw.	Nabonye.
We really have to wait for this.	Tugomba rwose gutegereza kuri ibi.
He does as he pleases.	Akora uko ashaka.
What do you want! 	Urashaka iki!
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I want to work.	Ndashaka gukora.
But the reason was far from me.	Ariko impamvu yari kure yanjye.
Instead of being human, you have someone.	Aho kuba umuntu, ufite umuntu.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
I have mistakes that can happen.	Mfite amakosa ashobora kubaho.
It's good if you know what you're doing.	Nibyiza niba uzi icyo ukora.
I need something to live for.	Nkeneye ikintu cyo kubaho.
He is very young.	Ari muto cyane.
Who do you think is the best?	Ninde utekereza ko ari mwiza?.
You can make a lot of money.	Urashobora kubona amafaranga menshi cyane.
We have a lot.	Dufite byinshi.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga cyane.
We are his family now.	Turi umuryango we ubu.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
He had none.	Ntabwo yari afite.
Obviously that is not the case.	Biragaragara ko ibyo atari byo rwose.
It would be backwards.	Byari gusubira inyuma.
There you are alone.	Hariho wowe wenyine.
Under me.	Munsi yanjye.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
Going forward, going backwards.	Kujya imbere, gusubira inyuma.
Or maybe he had.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yari afite.
It’s great when it’s out and about.	Nibyiza cyane iyo ari hanze kandi hafi.
You have to talk to him now.	Ugomba kuvugana nawe ubu.
I can do so much.	Nshobora gukora byinshi cyane.
There are only people.	Hariho abantu gusa.
I want something to eat.	Ndashaka icyo kurya.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I really should stop reading this.	Nkwiye rwose kureka gusoma ibi.
After all, parking is good for money.	Nyuma ya byose, guhagarika imodoka ni byiza kubona amafaranga.
You want	Urashaka.
Maybe you should do it.	Birashoboka ko ugomba kubikora.
I feel that way.	Ndumva aribyo.
I can get along well.	Nshobora kubana neza.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
Nothing, or not at all.	Nta kintu na kimwe, cyangwa ntabwo aribyo rwose.
But he didn't think so.	Ariko ntabwo yatekerezaga.
But that was true for many that morning.	Ariko ibyo byari ukuri kuri benshi muri icyo gitondo.
He really did.	Yabikoze rwose.
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
You saw someone.	Wabonye umuntu.
She must be at home.	Agomba kuba murugo.
The food was good.	Ibiryo byari byiza.
We are the only ones.	Turi twe gusa.
He went to find people like him.	Yagiye gushaka abantu nka we.
They have a plan, and they are very human.	Bafite gahunda, kandi ni abantu cyane.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You have to do it every day.	Ugomba kubikora buri munsi.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
The family is great.	Umuryango ni mwiza.
You were just a girl.	Wari umukobwa gusa.
Walking was very difficult.	Kugenda byari bigoye cyane.
They had no money.	Ntabwo bari bafite amafaranga.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
He thought about the possibilities.	Yatekereje ku bishoboka.
He is who he is, man.	Niwe uwo ari we, umuntu.
Her son had no problem.	Umwana we nta kibazo yari afite.
But seeing was good.	Ariko kubona byari byiza.
I have the opportunity to go with you.	Mfite amahirwe yo kujyana nawe.
He thought I should do something.	Yatekereje ko ngomba kugira icyo nkora.
They knew there were people downstairs.	Bari bazi ko hari abantu munsi.
She used to be alone.	Yakundaga kuba wenyine.
I have a new friend.	Mfite inshuti nshya.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mwiza cyane.
That's exactly what we can do.	Nibyo rwose dushobora gukora.
I don't know enough.	Ntabwo nzi bihagije.
And at home.	No murugo.
Uri?	Uri?
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
You are winning.	Urimo gutsinda.
He was still a young child.	Yari akiri umwana muto.
What he needs most is that he needs a family.	Icyo akeneye cyane ni uko akeneye umuryango.
But there is more.	Ariko hariho byinshi.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
No one can do everything.	Nta muntu ushobora gukora byose.
We are all together.	Twese turi hamwe.
This is what I have seen so far.	Ibi nibyo nabonye kugeza ubu.
I don't want a problem.	Sinshaka ikibazo.
You are beautiful, as usual.	Uri mwiza, nkuko bisanzwe.
I don't know where.	Sinzi aho.
And this is very similar.	Kandi ibi birasa cyane.
This is exactly what happened.	Ibi nibyo rwose.
He knows how to do it.	Azi kubikora.
We can't see that problem.	Ntabwo dushobora kubona icyo kibazo.
But it turned out well.	Ariko byagenze neza icyo gihe.
You, more than anything else.	Wowe, kuruta ikindi kintu cyose.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
I did not know.	Sinari nzi.
But we must.	Ariko tugomba.
There is a place where you can.	Hariho aho ushobora.
They only have one thing.	Bafite ikintu kimwe gusa.
Yes, he was a man.	Nibyo, yari umuntu.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
You are bad.	Uri mubi.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
This is not a small family.	Uyu ntabwo ari umuryango muto.
Especially his daughter.	Cyane cyane umukobwa we.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
Not at any time.	Ntabwo ari igihe icyo ari cyo cyose.
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
He had to be good.	Yagombaga kuba mwiza.
In fact, this is likely to be the case.	Mubyukuri, ibi birashoboka ko bizaba byinshi.
Money was another problem.	Amafaranga yari ikindi kibazo.
He did.	Yabikoze.
Nor did he want to do anything.	Cyangwa ntacyo yashakaga gukora.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
You have to think hard.	Ugomba gutekereza cyane.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
It was good enough.	Byari byiza bihagije.
I have a bad day.	Mfite umunsi mubi.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
He went to work.	Yagiye ku kazi.
That was enough for him.	Byari bihagije kuri we.
I did a lot of things in school.	Nakoze ibintu byinshi mwishuri.
You don't have to say.	Ntugomba kuvuga.
But no later.	Ariko nta nyuma.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
It really wasn't normal.	Ntabwo rwose byari bisanzwe.
Tomorrow is not true.	Ejo ntabwo ari ukuri.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
You can find his opinion here.	Urashobora kubona igitekerezo cye hano.
Who knows what a woman was like.	Ninde uzi icyo umugore yari cyo.
But he has none.	Ariko nta na kimwe afite.
I should go.	Nkwiye kugenda.
Yes, everyone knows everything here.	Nibyo, abantu bose bazi byose hano.
Just seeing.	Kubona gusa.
He would say nothing.	Nta cyo yari kuvuga.
He had done nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yari yakoze.
It would be great.	Byaba ari byiza cyane.
He looked away.	Yarebye kure cyane.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I don’t have much to say.	Ntabwo mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Good thing, really.	Ikintu cyiza, rwose.
But it is very good.	Ariko nibyiza cyane.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
And he never did.	Kandi ntiyigeze abikora.
Everyone wanted something.	Umuntu wese yashakaga ikintu.
He had a lot of talent.	Yari afite impano nyinshi.
There was something he had to do.	Hariho ikintu yagombaga gukora.
But it is not, and it is not.	Ariko sibyo, kandi sibyo.
I want to hear.	Ndashaka kumva.
But not tomorrow.	Ariko si ejo.
I'm happy here right now.	Nishimiye hano kuri ubu.
Good, good! 	Mwiza, mwiza!
I'm glad to hear that.	Nishimiye kumva avuga.
It wasn't much at the time.	Ntabwo byari byinshi icyo gihe.
It was easy to see why.	Byari byoroshye kubona impamvu.
He has worked here before.	Yakoze akazi hano mbere.
He would see nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari kubona.
You have to know the same thing.	Ugomba kumenya ikintu kimwe.
I am looking for a girl.	Ndashaka umukobwa.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
But it is my fault.	Ariko ni amakosa yanjye.
But inside, he had no hope.	Ariko imbere, ntabwo yari yizeye na gato.
He was well aware of this.	Muri ibyo yari azi neza.
You can also be easy.	Urashobora kandi kuba byoroshye.
Maybe he had.	Birashoboka ko yari afite.
Sometimes I thought of this.	Rimwe na rimwe natekereje ibi.
That's right.	Nibyo, ni.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
I'm not going.	Ntabwo ngiye kugenda.
He should not have been here.	Ntabwo yari akwiye kuba hano.
One time every day.	Igihe kimwe buri munsi.
But there is one thing.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe.
I don't know what to do today.	Sinzi icyo gukora muri iki gihe.
Aho.	Aho.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
He is one and all.	Ni umwe kandi bose.
He is a thinker.	Ni umuntu utekereza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze.
That's what he knew.	Ibyo ni byo yari azi.
Not this week.	Ntabwo ari iki cyumweru.
I can't wait.	Ntashobora gutegereza.
It's the same with him.	Birasa na we.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
Everyone is really, really good.	Umuntu wese ni mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose.
That's right.	Nukuri.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
And you can too.	Kandi nawe urashobora.
I don't know what it is.	Ntazi icyo aricyo.
A woman would be everything she wanted and needed.	Umugore yaba ikintu cyose yashakaga kandi akeneye.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
Simple things.	Ibintu byoroshye.
It was great for us.	Byari byiza cyane kuri twe.
He didn't try.	Ntabwo yagerageje.
Maybe even.	Ahari na mbere.
Of course, he also had help.	Nibyo, nawe yari afite ubufasha.
It's a good idea to have.	Ni ikibazo cyiza kugira.
I think you are scared.	Ndatekereza ko ufite ubwoba.
It was a lot of things.	Byari ibintu byinshi.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
Things he could do.	Ibintu yashoboraga gukora.
He was bad.	Yari mubi.
You have to be ashamed.	Ugomba kugira isoni.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
Nothing, maybe.	Nta kintu na kimwe, ahari.
But they were far away.	Ariko bari kure cyane.
You have no job.	Nta kazi ufite.
Many, many, many.	Benshi, benshi, benshi.
From a distance it was easy to plan.	Kure ya kure byari byoroshye gahunda.
Here's an idea.	Hano hari igitekerezo.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye rwose.
He did it for a long time.	Yabikoze igihe kirekire.
I did something wrong.	Nakoze ikintu kibi.
Sometimes not so much.	Rimwe na rimwe ntabwo ari byinshi.
But enough of all this.	Ariko bihagije kuri ibi byose.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
He must have been alone.	Agomba kuba yari wenyine.
He didn't know how to walk or stay.	Ntiyari azi kugenda cyangwa kuguma.
He wanted his day.	Yashakaga ko munsi ye.
For me, for him, for us.	Kuri njye, kuri we, kuri twe.
You can do it easily.	Urashobora kubikora byoroshye.
You did it all yourself.	Ibyo byose wabikoze wenyine.
I also like good food.	Nkunda kandi ibiryo byiza.
I hope you can do it !.	Nizere ko ushobora kubikora!.
But you should have known what you were up to.	Ariko wari ukwiye kumenya ibyo urimo.
Right now, he had a job to do.	Kuri ubu, yari afite akazi ko gukora.
And existence is.	Kandi kubaho ni.
You can read one or the other.	Ushobora gusoma kimwe cyangwa kimwe.
I can't say.	Sinshobora kuvuga.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
Everyone has to buy.	Umuntu wese agomba kugura.
That thing.	Icyo kintu.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He didn't want to wait.	Ntiyashakaga gutegereza hejuru.
He was inside.	Yari imbere.
It was not good at all.	Ntabwo byari byiza rwose.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
And you may be right.	Kandi ushobora kuba ufite ukuri.
He wanted to eat and go.	Yashakaga kurya no kugenda.
He is sitting alone.	Yicaye wenyine.
I knew why.	Nari nzi impamvu.
He didn't want to do anything.	Ntiyashakaga kugira icyo akora.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari we.
No one has ever done that.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze abikora.
Not good but they have everything you need.	Ntabwo ari byiza ariko bafite ibyo ukeneye byose.
Sometimes it's good.	Rimwe na rimwe ni byiza.
Or it was not good.	Cyangwa ntabwo byari byiza.
That would be nice.	Ko byaba byiza.
But he was.	Ariko yari.
It was a difficult situation.	Byari ibintu bigoye.
I mean, this morning.	Ndashaka kuvuga, muri iki gitondo.
It is not one thing or another.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Ushaka kuvuga byinshi.
I am studying.	Ndimo kwiga.
He did not have much luck.	Ntabwo yari afite amahirwe menshi.
I really can't wait for that !.	Ntabwo rwose nshobora gutegereza ibyo!.
In no.	Muri no.
He loved it.	Yakundaga.
I heard it all.	Nanjye numvise byose.
You can't win money.	Ntushobora gutsinda amafaranga.
He went to find something.	Yagiye gushaka ikintu.
Once a week.	Rimwe mu cyumweru.
We need money.	Dukeneye amafaranga.
She thought of getting married again.	Yatekerezaga kongera gushaka.
I'm not sure now.	Ntabwo nzi neza ubu.
He should have gone alone.	Yari akwiye kugenda wenyine.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's really good with you.	Nibyiza rwose nawe.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He did not have a car.	Ntabwo yari afite imodoka.
We are his children.	Turi abana be.
That's not the whole point.	Icyo ntabwo aricyo kibazo rwose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
One never understood anything.	Umuntu ntiyigeze yumva neza icyo aricyo cyose.
I needed to do it.	Nari nkeneye kubikora.
However, he had high expectations.	Ariko, yari yiteze byinshi.
He had no time for it.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo.
I never thought it would be possible.	Sinatekerezaga rwose ko bishoboka.
We can see nothing.	Ntacyo dushobora kubona.

In all things.	Muri byose.
She took her hair.	Yafashe umusatsi.
His wife looked right in front of him.	Umugore we yarebye neza imbere ye.

He said what he needed to say.	Yavuze ibyo yari akeneye kuvuga.

You have to go home.	Ugomba gutaha.
No one was nearby.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hafi aho.

Not something big, but something I saw.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini, ariko ikintu nabonye.
I didn't see much for me.	Ntabwo nabonye ibintu byinshi kuri njye.
He didn't want to look down.	Ntiyashakaga kureba hasi.
But that is not what he thought.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo yatekerezaga.
He knew what he needed.	Yari azi icyo yari akeneye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It was really good, that day.	Mubyukuri byari byiza rwose, uwo munsi.

One of them is time to work.	Kimwe muri ibyo ni igihe cyo gukora.
But I felt good.	Ariko numvise ari byiza.
He said he would be on the ground.	Yavuze ko azaba ari hasi.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
He seemed far away.	Yasaga naho ari kure.
I have a problem.	Mfite ikibazo.
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.

He was right, but he was right.	Yari afite ukuri, ariko na we yari afite.
I'm going to talk to you.	Ngiye kuvugana nawe.
He knew nothing about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi kuri ibyo.
And it is absolutely true.	Kandi ni ukuri rwose.
He didn’t even want to be alone.	Ntiyashakaga no kuba wenyine.
But he said a lot.	Ariko yavuze byinshi.
Can someone help ?.	Umuntu arashobora gufasha?.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni byiza kuri ibyo.
This was a dress.	Iyi yari imyenda.
My son was lucky.	Umuhungu wanjye yagize amahirwe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I didn’t even want to be in the same room.	Sinifuzaga no kuba mu cyumba kimwe.
I don't like this.	Ntabwo nkunda ibi.
I think we should go.	Ndatekereza ko tugomba kugenda.
I think that's good.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari byiza.
He looked at the child.	Yarebye umwana.
You like to do it outside.	Ukunda kubikora hanze.
He has to talk about a woman.	Agomba kuvuga umugore.
But only one of them.	Ariko buri kimwe muri byo rimwe gusa.
She had a child.	Yari afite umwana.
Just something to know.	Gusa ikintu cyo kumenya.
Someone had to go.	Umuntu yagombaga kugenda.
That's right.	Nukuri.
They have every problem.	Bafite buri kibazo.
And you have to be good.	Kandi ugomba kuba mwiza.
Eventually, he started talking.	Amaherezo, yatangiye kuvuga.
Definitely one to watch.	Rwose umuntu agomba kureba.
He does not.	Ntabwo abikora.
Something is an idea.	Ikintu ni igitekerezo.
It was a thing.	Byari ibintu.
Someone wanted to play bad.	Umuntu yashakaga gukina nabi.
This room is very bad.	Iki cyumba ni kibi cyane.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
She is worried.	Afite impungenge.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, hafi ya bose.
He knew he was close.	Yari azi ko ari hafi.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga rwose.
I want to feel you inside me.	Ndashaka kumva uri imbere muri njye.
But he knows this is not true.	Ariko azi ko ibyo atari ukuri rwose.
I thought it would be nice.	Natekereje ko byaba byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And he was going to go see.	Kandi yari agiye kugenda kureba.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ikintu cyiza yakoze.
But it wasn’t tennis.	Ariko ntabwo yari tennis.
This is my time.	Aha ni umwanya wanjye.
He went above me.	Yagiye hejuru yanjye.
The truth is far away.	Ukuri ni kure cyane.
I wanted to go.	Nashakaga kugenda.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The car had gone.	Imodoka yari yagiye.
He never left.	Ntiyigeze agenda.

If we can do that it would be great.	Niba dushobora gukora ibyo byaba byiza.
This was a problem.	Uyu yari ibibazo.
In front of me.	Imbere yanjye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, rimwe, bari abantu.
He was not ready to do that.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye kubikora.
And he was in front of everyone.	Kandi yari imbere ya bose.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, niba bishoboka.
And apparently not.	Kandi biragaragara ko atari we.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
You can read more here.	Urashobora gusoma byinshi hano.

You can have everything.	Urashobora kugira byose.
He never felt good.	Ntabwo yigeze yumva ko ari byiza.
No one knew who he was.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi uwo ari we.
Only this was good.	Gusa ibi byari byiza.
I was looking for something else.	Nashakaga ikindi kintu.
Talk to you soon and keep up the good content.	Kuvugana wenyine.
Good gift.	Impano nziza.
Especially, alone.	Cyane, wenyine.

I always like	Nkunda buri gihe.
Winning is not easy.	Gutsinda ntabwo byoroshye.
I saw.	Nabonye.
The children were in school.	Abana bari mwishuri.
He said he was very worried about her.	Yavuze ko yari afite impungenge nyinshi kuri we.
I have a problem.	Mfite ikibazo.
He has to go to work.	Agomba kujya ku kazi.
But there is something.	Ariko hariho ikintu.
You know where he is.	Uzi aho ari.
That was a good thing for me.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza kuri njye.
There is a place for almost everyone.	Hariho umwanya wa hafi ya bose.
I'm not sure how he did it.	Ntabwo rwose nzi neza uburyo yabikoze.
I did a lot.	Nakoze byinshi cyane.
It's good that someone was.	Nibyiza ko umuntu yari.
I don't want to hear.	Sinshaka kumva.
But always for me.	Ariko buri gihe kuri njye.
He never liked it.	Ntiyigeze akunda.
For him it was a lot for him.	Kuri we byari byinshi kuri we.
Maybe, but maybe not.	Ahari birashoboka, ariko birashoboka ko atari byo.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ibyo byose ni inyuma gusa.
We are not close, or anything else.	Ntabwo turi hafi, cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
You are the problem.	Ni wowe kibazo.
But he is.	Ariko ni we.
It's just an idea.	Ni igitekerezo gusa.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
And I can't figure out why.	Kandi ntashobora kumenya impamvu.
Whatever you want.	Icyo ushaka cyose.
I hope he does.	Ndizera ko azabikora.
As if he must be doing something.	Nkaho agomba kuba akora ikintu.
I think it's possible.	Ntekereza ko bishoboka.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
Yes, you can do this.	Nibyo, urashobora gukora ibi.
He had no reason.	Ntabwo yari afite impamvu.
He had to figure out why.	Yagombaga kumenya impamvu.
My place.	Umwanya wanjye.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
I think he did it tonight.	Ndatekereza ko yakoze iri joro.
I should have stayed on it.	Nari nkwiye kuguma kuri yo.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
I wanted you to be close from the beginning.	Nashakaga ko uri hafi kuva mbere.
I never believed.	Sinigeze nizera.
At that time many.	Icyo gihe benshi.
You want something else.	Urashaka ikindi kintu.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
Everyone was a little distant and scared.	Abantu bose bari kure gato kandi bafite ubwoba.
'.	'.
He thought you were too.	Yatekereje ko nawe uri.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
I'm not sure if that would be good.	Sinzi neza niba ibyo byaba byiza.
I think it worked out very well.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
His gifts were many.	Impano ye yari nyinshi.
I am a film actor.	Ndi umukinnyi wa firime.
He thought about his choice.	Yatekereje ku byo yahisemo.
And it was, in a short time.	Kandi byari, mu gihe gito.
He was probably the only one here.	Birashoboka ko yari wenyine hano.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I finally saw something.	Amaherezo nabonye ikintu.
It was not all.	Ntabwo byari byose.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
That would be great.	Ibyo byari kuba byiza cyane.
He needed time.	Yari akeneye igihe.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira icyo gukora.
And it's close.	Kandi ni hafi.
She is her father's daughter.	Ni umukobwa wa se.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Not always good.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari byiza.
I also wanted to be away from him.	Nashakaga no kuba kure ye.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka, mbwira.
They were almost there.	Bari hafi igihe.
I mean, that's pretty obvious.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ibyo biragaragara rwose.
He says he would do it again.	Avuga ko kandi yari kongera kubikora.
But that was it.	Ariko ibyo byari.
Much of that.	Byinshi muri ibyo.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
One could talk about that.	Umuntu yashoboraga kuvuga kuri ibyo.
He should have known better.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza.
And indeed.	Kandi rwose.
And there is a reason.	Kandi hariho impamvu.
There was no one behind.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari inyuma.
He later left.	Nyuma yaje kugenda.
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
I hope this is possible.	Ndizera ko ibi bishoboka.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I'm not sure	Sinzi neza.
He also went fast.	Yagiye kandi vuba.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I was a child at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umwana.
There are concerns about that.	Hariho impungenge kuri ibyo.
This will be fine.	Ibi bizaba byiza.
He heard nothing.	Nta cyo yumvise.
You know it's true.	Uzi ko ari ukuri.
But he is not for her.	Ariko si we kuri we.
However, this is not normal.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
It wasn’t you at all.	Ntabwo wari wowe rwose.
You are alone.	Uri wenyine.
She likes to be scared.	Akunda kugira ubwoba.
We don't need that.	Ntabwo dukeneye ibyo.
In the movie.	Na firime.
He said that was possible.	Yavuze ko ibyo bishoboka.
He thought it was true.	Yatekereje ko ari ukuri.
You have to go to jail one day.	Umunsi umwe ugomba kujya muri gereza.
We had no plans.	Ntabwo twari dufite gahunda.
I don’t know what you really want to do.	Sinzi icyo ushaka gukora mubyukuri.
We cannot be sure that he was really here.	Ntidushobora no kumenya neza ko yari hano koko.
It's not difficult at all.	Ntabwo bigoye na gato.
It's not over.	Ntabwo ari hejuru.
But he was right.	Ariko yavuze ukuri.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
He was wearing his clothes.	Yambaye imyenda ye.
We are here together.	Turi hano hamwe.
He knew there was.	Yari azi ko hari.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
That's really good for me.	Nibyiza rwose kuri njye.
He went.	Yagiye.
I can't see the same thing.	Sinshobora kubona ikintu kimwe.
No looking ahead.	Nta kureba imbere.
He was happy to be there.	Yishimiye kuba ahari.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
We have to stop this.	Tugomba guhagarika ibi.
It is his last chance.	Ni amahirwe ye ya nyuma.
We didn't need much.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye byinshi.
Something to play with.	Ikintu cyo gukina.
Friends.	Inshuti.
We are all scared.	Twese dufite ubwoba.
I don't want to go back tonight.	Sinshaka gusubira muri iri joro.
We didn't have much.	Ntabwo twari dufite ibintu byinshi.
She loved to eat alone.	Yakundaga kurya wenyine.
He is ready to be.	Yiteguye kuba.
You really have to do it right.	Ugomba rwose kubikora neza.
.	.
The party was great.	Ibirori byari byiza.
They were my family.	Bari umuryango wanjye.
Absolutely.	Nukuri cyane.
That's not really the case with you.	Ntabwo rwose aricyo kibazo imbere yawe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
You are so talented.	Ufite impano cyane.
He thought the family.	Yatekereje ko umuryango.
In fact, he was not happy at all.	Mu kuri, ntabwo yishimiye na gato.
Someone who is very talented and intelligent.	Umuntu ufite impano cyane kandi uzi ubwenge.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
Most of me.	Benshi muri njye.
He looked at her with problems.	Yarebye afite ibibazo.
It was just clothes.	Byari imyenda gusa.
You have to look down.	Ugomba kureba hasi.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
Just one thing to do.	Ikintu kimwe gusa cyo gukora.
And he really wants to talk.	Kandi arashaka kuvuga rwose.
He got the idea right.	Yabonye igitekerezo neza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I'm not sure what to do.	Sinzi neza icyo gukora.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
He did really well.	Yakoze neza rwose.
He may know something, whatever.	Ashobora kuba azi ikintu, ibyo aribyo byose.
We have to stay here.	Tugomba kuguma hano.
He was at work.	Yari ku kazi.
We needed a plan.	Twari dukeneye gahunda.
Then it will be better.	Icyo gihe bizaba byiza.
No one is in the room.	Nta muntu uri mu cyumba.
You have to talk to him.	Ugomba kuvugana nawe.
The right money.	Amafaranga akwiye.
Sitting behind her was a woman.	Yicaye inyuma ye kuri twe yari umugore.
She has a son.	Afite umuhungu we.
He was ready to take action.	Yari yiteguye kugira icyo akora.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
I like to talk.	Nkunda kuvuga.
He never lived here alone.	Ntabwo yigeze aba hano wenyine.
And more than ever.	Kandi kuruta rimwe na rimwe.
For me, it was just hair.	Kuri njye, yari umusatsi gusa.
I didn't know what to do.	Sinari nzi icyo gukora.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
I don’t think you should be.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ugomba kuba.
We are friends.	Turi inshuti.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe ushobora gukora kuri ibyo.
He was there, but he was not there.	Yari ahari, ariko ntabwo yari ahari.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ni amafaranga.
He didn't know what to think of any of them.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza kuri kimwe muri byo.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Good idea, isn't it ?.	Igitekerezo cyiza, sibyo?.
I'm not very good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza cyane.
The end was near.	Amaherezo yari hafi.
I am here now.	Ubu ndi hano.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
Makes a movie.	Akora firime.
He could not see that.	Ntabwo yashoboraga kubona ibyo.
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
I have to think.	Ngomba gutekereza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He is an expert.	Ni umuhanga.
At that time I was not sure of anything.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi neza ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
I just thought.	Natekereje gusa.
Just a question.	Ikibazo gusa.
No one has good things.	Nta muntu ufite ibintu byiza.
We were just people.	Twari abantu gusa.
Someone wants to do it.	Umuntu arashaka kubikora.
I feel good.	Numva ari mwiza.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
There is something wrong with him.	Hariho ikintu kibi kuri we.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
You are very young.	Uri muto cyane.
She was beautiful, confident.	Yari mwiza, yizeye.
But advice, that’s fine.	Ariko inama, nibyiza.
He can play.	Ashobora gukina.
Is he far away? 	Ari kure ye?
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
You want to do well.	Urashaka gukora neza.
It is so far.	Ni kugeza ubu.
As a plan.	Nka gahunda.
You can't either.	Ntushobora no.
I think he has many.	Ndakeka ko afite benshi.
It's good if you're going.	Nibyiza niba ugiye.
Something is not right.	Ikintu ntabwo ari cyiza.
He was an actor.	Yari umukinnyi.
I never believed.	Sinigeze nizera.
You can learn a lot from me.	Urashobora kwiga byinshi kuri njye.
We didn't have a phone.	Ntabwo twari dufite terefone.
That's not good, it's not good at all.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza, ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
But you have to do it.	Ariko ugomba kubikora.
I don't like it at all.	Ntabwo nkunda na gato.
I like to work alone.	Nkunda gukora wenyine.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
Apparently he does.	Biragaragara ko abikora.
We have everything you can think of.	Dufite ibintu byose ushobora gutekereza.
I realized that I needed help.	Nabonye ko nkeneye ubufasha.
But that was not the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari ukuri.
That he could buy.	Ko yashoboraga kugura.
We have no problem.	Nta kibazo dufite.
All of this is a good thing.	Ibi byose ni ibintu byiza.
I'm sure that's the case.	Nzi neza ko ari byo.
That's exactly what you want.	Nukuri icyo ushaka.
I’ve seen a lot of that.	Nabonye byinshi muri byo.
Everyone needs to be alone sometimes.	Umuntu wese akeneye kuba wenyine rimwe na rimwe.
A lot of things, really.	Ibintu byinshi, mubyukuri.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba rwose.
It's too young.	Ndi muto.
Everyone loves what they love.	Umuntu wese kubyo akunda.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
For the first time, we were close.	Bwa mbere, twari hafi.
We have to live.	Tugomba kubaho.
We had a nice house.	Twari dufite inzu nziza.
Or for him.	Cyangwa kuri we.
She was a wise, intelligent woman.	Yari umugore uzi ubwenge, uzi ubwenge.
No hearing at all.	Nta kumva na gato.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He is in it.	Ari muri yo.
I never thought it would be possible.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko bishoboka.
I don't know how to say this.	Ntazi kuvuga ibi.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza.
He didn't really need it.	Ntabwo yari akeneye rwose.
If so, then so be it.	Niba aribyo, nuko.
You can't be afraid and confident.	Ntushobora kugira ubwoba no kwizera.
It was his favorite food.	Yari ibiryo yakundaga cyane.
I think that is possible.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
You are also going to watch the movie you mentioned.	Ugiye no kureba firime wavuze.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, icyo ni igitekerezo cye.
It's good.	Ndi mwiza.
Keeping your car safe.	Kugira imodoka yawe neza.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
It looks good.	Asa naho ari mwiza.
It was not good for him.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri we.
It's inside.	Ni imbere.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
He was a bad guy.	Yari umuntu muto mubi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It was my fault.	Nari amakosa yanjye.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
But it is not far away.	Ariko ntabwo iri kure cyane.
He saw something else at the time.	Yabonye ikindi kintu icyo gihe.
No questions asked.	Nta kibazo yabajije.
He was out and about.	Yari hanze kandi hanze.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi uko ni ko byagenze.
Same with me.	Kimwe nanjye.
That top is good.	Iyo hejuru ni byiza.
This is probably best.	Ibi birashoboka ko ari byiza cyane.
I know nothing.	Nta na kimwe nzi.
I can't swim.	Sinshobora koga.
First wife.	Umugore wa mbere.
He was not human and nothing.	Ntiyari umuntu kandi nta kintu na kimwe.
But most people.	Ariko abantu benshi.
Really good stuff.	Mubyukuri rwose, ibintu byiza cyane.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I hope you do well.	Nizere ko ukora neza.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
No one is involved.	Nta muntu urimo.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
Or maybe he still has it.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko afite kugeza ubu.
You have to go find problems.	Ugomba kujya gushaka ibibazo.
Or for anyone.	Cyangwa ku muntu uwo ari we wese.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
You know you did.	Uzi ko nawe wabikoze.
He said that was something.	Yavuze ko ibyo byari ikintu.
He was a young child.	Yari umwana muto.
He is afraid that he knows a lot.	Afite ubwoba ko azi byinshi.
He did not know when.	Ntiyari azi igihe icyo ari cyo.
He could have.	Yashoboraga kugira.
He did what he wanted.	Yakoze ibyo yashakaga.
I know what it is.	Nzi icyo aricyo.
I'm scared, if you have to know the truth.	Mfite ubwoba, niba ugomba kumenya ukuri.
But the truth is.	Ariko ukuri ni uko.
Or someone like him.	Cyangwa umuntu nka we.
But whatever that may be.	Ariko ibyo aribyo byose yaba.
There is a woman who can know more.	Hariho umugore ushobora kumenya byinshi.
It's at work.	Ndi ku kazi.
She was probably my youngest daughter.	Birashoboka ko yari umukobwa wanjye muto.
We have to learn.	Tugomba kwiga.
I think he is right.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri.
You can't wait to see.	Ntushobora gutegereza kureba.
I know that.	Nzi ko aribyo.
If you need to leave.	Niba ukeneye kuva aho.
He knew how to party.	Yari azi gukora ibirori.
But something to think about.	Ariko ikintu cyo gutekereza.
You don't know who he is.	Ntabwo uzi uwo ari we.
He is not my son.	Ntabwo ari umuhungu wanjye.
This time, however, there is a problem.	Iki gihe ariko, hari ikibazo.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
I just heard.	Gusa numvise.
No one said it was easy.	Nta muntu wavuze ko byoroshye.
But you can.	Ariko birashoboka ko ushobora.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He started playing on his own.	Yatangiye gukina wenyine.
I'm not sure why.	Ntabwo nzi neza impamvu.
Something long.	Ikintu kirekire.
I need to know what happened.	Nkeneye kumenya uko byagenze.
That's right.	Nibyo mubyukuri.
Probably not the best thing to do.	Birashoboka ko atari cyo kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
She didn't know how to feel.	Ntiyari azi uko agomba kumva.
That's what everyone said.	Nibyo buri wese yavuze.
We need children.	Dukeneye abana.
He says that's enough.	Avuga ko bihagije.
He could have stayed in prison.	Yashoboraga kuguma muri gereza.
But he did not know what it was.	Ariko ntiyari azi icyo ari cyo.
Everything was simple.	Ibintu byose byari byoroshye.
What he expected.	Ibyo yari yiteze.
We were right.	Twari dufite ukuri.
She is a very beautiful child.	Ni umwana mwiza cyane.
He knows everything.	Azi byose.
I can't figure this out.	Ntabwo nshobora kumenya iyi.
Luck was close to him.	Amahirwe yari hafi ye.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze akora.
His wife is alone.	Umugore we ni wenyine.
It’s not really a way to live well.	Ntabwo rwose ari uburyo bwo kubaho neza.
I heard nothing.	Nta kintu numvise.
He is a really good guy.	Ni umusore mwiza rwose.
But this was good.	Ariko ibi byari byiza.
But you know what you're doing.	Ariko uzi icyo ukora.
But for now.	Ariko kuri ubu.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
It would be nice if there was.	Byaba byiza ahari.
This was his first money.	Iyi yari amafaranga ye ya mbere.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
I thought he was just scared for no reason.	Natekereje ko yari afite ubwoba gusa nta mpamvu.
Now, everything is fine.	Ubu, ibintu byose ni byiza.
But she was a smart girl.	Ariko yari umukobwa uzi ubwenge.
One of us.	Umwe muri twe.
And he was almost all of them.	Kandi yari hafi ya bose muri bose.
All day long	Umunsi wose.
There is work for him.	Hariho akazi kuri we.
They were very close.	Bari hafi cyane.
He didn't know it wasn't me.	Ntiyari azi ko atari njye.
There is a lot to it.	Ni byinshi kuri byo.
He knows exactly what it is.	Azi neza icyo aricyo.
You were so beautiful.	Wari mwiza cyane.
He is here.	Ari hano.
I never saw it clearly.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona neza.
I think this would be good for that.	Ntekereza ko ibi byaba byiza kuri ibyo.
I want to do everything.	Ndashaka gukora byose.
There are many reasons.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi.
Telling and normal.	Kubwira kandi bisanzwe.
It's all the same to me.	Byose ni kimwe kuri njye.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
He can't speak.	Ntashobora kuvuga.
It is on that house.	Ni kuri iyo nzu.
He thought of trying to find something else.	Yatekereje kugerageza gushaka ikindi kintu.
But he was right.	Ariko yari afite ukuri.
I don't want to read again.	Sinshaka kongera gusoma.
I think he really should.	Ndatekereza ko agomba rwose.
I am your friend.	Ndi inshuti yawe.
Many people are too many, too far away.	Abantu benshi ni benshi cyane, kure cyane.
He didn't even want to leave work.	Ntiyashakaga no kuva ku kazi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
But he knew in that look that he had failed.	Ariko yari azi ko ibyo atari byiza.
He was a teacher.	Yari umwarimu.
But he did not want to do that.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kubikora.
She didn't know how to swim.	Ntiyari azi uburyo bwo koga.
It's something you don't want.	Ni ikintu udashaka.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He thought of everything.	Yatekereje kuri byose.
I have nothing.	Nta na kimwe mfite.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, arashobora kuba byinshi cyane.
Everything.	Ibintu byose.
I never did any of that.	Sinigeze nkora kimwe muri ibyo.
They have no job.	Nta kazi bafite.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
He thinks you are beautiful.	Yibwira ko uri mwiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
And indeed.	Kandi rwose.
But it was great.	Ariko byari byiza cyane.
That's not what you need.	Ntabwo aribyo ukeneye.
All the best.	Ibintu byiza byose.
Drinking sometimes is good for me.	Kunywa rimwe na rimwe ni byiza kuri njye.
The food is really good.	Ibiryo ni byiza rwose.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
But he seemed to know what it was.	Ariko yasaga naho azi icyo aricyo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I want to be with you.	Ndashaka kubana nawe.
He didn't have to wait long.	Ntabwo yagombaga gutegereza igihe kirekire.
He hadn't heard for a long time.	Ntabwo yigeze yumva igihe kirekire.
You saw that today.	Wabonye ko uyu munsi.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
One time! 	Umwanya umwe!
he said.	yavuze.
To be friends	Kuba inshuti.
It was as if he had never walked.	Byari nkaho atigeze agenda.
Too many.	Benshi cyane.
And not too high.	Kandi ntabwo ari hejuru cyane.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
He knows things.	Azi ibintu.
Or maybe they are scared.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko bafite ubwoba.
This is a great time.	Uyu ni umwanya mwiza.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
We have the talent to do that.	Dufite impano yo kubikora.
If it was easy.	Niba byari byoroshye.
But he really wants to try it.	Ariko arashaka rwose kugerageza.
Please, look good.	Nyamuneka, yasaga neza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
No going at all.	Nta kugenda na gato.
I meant my plan.	Nashakaga kuvuga gahunda yanjye.
I can get out of this anytime.	Nshobora kuva muri ibi igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
I hope she is a good woman.	Nizera ko ari umugore mwiza.
You can try anything.	Urashobora kugerageza ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
You need help !.	Urashaka ubufasha!.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
She was very good at everything.	Yari mwiza cyane muri byose.
Not all of them are.	Ntabwo bose ari.
I really feel we can.	Ndumva rwose dushobora.
He had nothing to do.	Nta kintu na kimwe yagombaga gukora.
That was enough.	Byari bihagije.
He really took the time.	Yafashe umwanya rwose.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi nibyo rwose.
All that waiting and nothing.	Ibyo gutegereza byose kandi ntacyo.
I knew almost everyone.	Nari nzi hafi ya bose.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
She was my daughter.	Yari umukobwa wanjye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
It's always me, me, me.	Buri gihe ni njye, njye, njye.
Apparently he was scared.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ubwoba.
It looks good as usual.	Birasa neza nkuko bisanzwe.
Let the truth out here.	Reka ukuri hanze aha.
He says he really does, though.	Avuga ko mubyukuri afite ariko.
That would do the same thing.	Ibyo byari gukora ikintu kimwe.
But he is a good player.	Ariko ni umukinnyi mwiza.
I did nothing.	Ntacyo nakoze.
He didn't have time to do it.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo kubikora.
But it turned out very well.	Ariko byagenze neza cyane.
No one has ever heard of it.	Nta muntu numwe wigeze yumva.
Really nice looking and very nice.	Mubyukuri kureba neza kandi byiza cyane.
He knows the truth.	Azi ukuri.
He can't speak.	Ntashobora kuvuga.
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane, mwiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko wabonye neza, nyuma ya byose.
He wanted to live.	Yashakaga kubaho.
This, in fact, is a gift.	Ibi, mubyukuri, ni impano.
This is possible.	Ibi birashoboka.
Too much waiting.	Gutegereza cyane.
It's not easy right now.	Ntabwo byoroshye ubu.
It was absolutely true.	Byari ukuri rwose.
And he was bad.	Kandi yari mubi.
Now.	Ubu.
Or things to do.	Cyangwa ibintu byo gukora.
It didn't happen.	Ntabwo byagenze.
You can't imagine why.	Ntushobora gutekereza impamvu.
.	.
You can't think.	Ntushobora gutekereza.
It was really great.	Rwose byari byiza cyane.
I should have heard.	Nari nkwiye kumva.
None of us commented.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wigeze agira icyo avuga.
We need to know more soon.	Tugomba kumenya byinshi vuba.
I'm sure he did.	Nzi neza ko yabikoze.
But they are at work.	Ariko bari ku kazi.
Tell me where you are.	Mbwira aho uri.
There are definitely some things one should not do.	Hariho rwose ibintu umuntu atagomba gukora.
Probably with him.	Birashoboka kuba hamwe na we.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari byo.
He said he could not do it.	Yavuze ko adashobora kubikora.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
You love your child.	Ukunda umwana wawe.
Everything is good and the same.	Byose ni byiza kandi ni kimwe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
He later got married.	Nyuma yaje gushaka.
He was a young child.	Yari umwana muto.
He would never know again.	Ntabwo yari kongera kumenya.
The truth is.	Ukuri muri.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
But not me either.	Ariko ntabwo ari njye na we.
Not many people are around.	Ntabwo abantu benshi bari hafi.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
This is all.	Ibi nibyo aribyo byose.
He didn't expect any of that.	Ntabwo yari yiteze kimwe muri ibyo.
I saw it here.	Nabonye hano.
However, he must win.	Ariko, agomba gutsinda.
I know every little thing.	Nzi buri kintu gito.
We were very high.	Twari hejuru cyane.
Inside, he was scared.	Imbere, yari afite ubwoba.
Not much.	Nta byinshi.
You don’t know who you can trust.	Ntabwo uzi uwo ushobora kwizera.
There is money for that.	Hariho amafaranga kuri ibyo.
I just heard.	Gusa numvise.
Maybe all of this was wrong.	Ahari ibi byose byari amakosa.
I'm going back to work early.	Ngiye gusubira ku kazi kare.
It's us.	Ni twe.
He had no reason to think.	Nta mpamvu yatekerezaga.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
I don't have to be scared.	Ntabwo ngomba kugira ubwoba.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko ibyo atari byo.
But this seems to be the case.	Ariko ibi birasa nkaho ari byo.
Walking home.	Kugenda murugo.
I love that one.	Nkunda uwo.
She always wanted a baby.	Buri gihe yashakaga umwana.
But he did not know for sure.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza.
He said he was alone.	Yavuze ko ari wenyine.
But you are the one to watch.	Ariko uri umuntu ugomba kureba.
It is not a fear of blasphemy.	Ntabwo ari ubwoba bwo kuvuga nabi.
We have to go back to that.	Tugomba gusubira kuri ibyo.
You are my friend.	Uri inshuti yanjye.
He is ashamed.	Afite isoni.
You don't have to do that.	Ntugomba kubikora.
But you don't want anything.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe ushaka.
He just told me.	Yambwiye gusa.
I know that is difficult.	Nzi ko ibyo bigoye.
That's exactly what he says.	Ibyo avuga mubyukuri nibyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I am your wife.	Ndi umugore wawe.
Good for everyone.	Nibyiza kuri bose.
It can't last long.	Ntashobora kubaho igihe kirekire.
Not at the moment.	Ntabwo ari kuri ubu.
I have no faith.	Ntacyo nizera.
One was a woman.	Umwe yari umugore.
Either way, you need to talk to him.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ugomba kuvugana na we.
If true, this is a huge setback.	Niba ari ukuri, iyi ni gusubira inyuma cyane.
Her place is great.	Umwanya we ni mwiza.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko atari byo kuri ibyo.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
You do what you want.	Ukora icyo ushaka.
We are close to home.	Turi hafi murugo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, tugomba kugenda vuba.
It was nothing to me.	Ntabwo byari ikintu kuri njye.
He thought about his choice.	Yatekereje ku byo yahisemo.
He is not a bad person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mubi.
And he was in fact.	Kandi yari mubyukuri.
And I need help.	Kandi nkeneye ubufasha.
Here, in fact, she was a beautiful woman.	Hano, mubyukuri, yari umugore mwiza.
But it worked.	Ariko byagenze neza.
This is good.	Ibi nibyiza.
This time it is not bad.	Iki gihe ntabwo ari kibi.
If so, there is no reason to do so.	Niba aribyo, nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
And it is in each of us.	Kandi iri muri buri wese muri twe.
And you saw what happened.	Kandi wabonye uko byagenze.
Like me, once.	Nkanjye, rimwe.
There are so many things here.	Hano hari ibintu byinshi cyane.
Inside me.	Imbere muri njye.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
He is happy to be leaving.	Yishimiye ko agenda vuba.
But, you want to do it.	Ariko, urashaka kubikora.
Most of all.	Byinshi muri byose.
This is too much.	Ibi ni byinshi cyane.
I want to ask for something.	Ndashaka gusaba ikintu.
Tell me the truth.	Mbwira ukuri.
I didn't think about that.	Ntacyo natekereje kuri ibyo.
Me, never.	Njye, nta na rimwe.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
I mean, obviously.	Ndashaka kuvuga, biragaragara.
Not much of it.	Nta byinshi muri byo.
He can stay.	Arashobora kuguma.
Very good thing.	Ikintu cyiza cyane.
When it is good.	Mugihe ari mwiza.
We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
It is not wise.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge.
It's your turn.	Ni umwanya wawe.
Shame, really shame.	Isoni, rwose isoni.
This is a very bad idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo kibi cyane.
I did well.	Nagize neza.
You need to think.	Ukeneye gutekereza.
That's not the problem here.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo hano.
Not good, man.	Ntabwo ari byiza, muntu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That was very easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye cyane.
He just knew he had to go home.	Yari azi gusa ko agomba gutaha.
I think from the beginning it would be nice.	Ndakeka ko kuva mbere byaba byiza.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
I like to be smart.	Nkunda kugira ubwenge.
That was easy.	Ibyo byari byoroshye.
I was not sure.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza.
Here or here.	Hano cyangwa hano.
If not, that's fine.	Niba kandi atari byo, nibyiza.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
You are doing this.	Urimo ukora ibi.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
I don’t like how I see things.	Ntabwo nkunda uko mbona ibintu.
I feel good.	Ndumva neza.
Doing a lot of things there.	Gukora ibintu byinshi aho.
He was not going to be too early.	Ntabwo yari agiye kuba kare cyane.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
Daily living plan.	Gahunda yo kubaho ya buri munsi.
It was too high.	Byari hejuru cyane.
My daughter likes to talk.	Umukobwa wanjye akunda kuvuga.
He finally had what he wanted.	Amaherezo yari afite ibyo yashakaga.
You don't have to go far.	Ntugomba kujya kure.
Really good reading.	Mubyukuri gusoma neza.
But they are not human.	Ariko si abantu.
It was on me all day, every day.	Byari kuri njye umunsi wose, buri munsi.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
Tomorrow is not here.	Ejo ntabwo ari hano.
I'm not here or here.	Ntabwo ndi hano cyangwa hano.
No problem at all.	Nta kibazo rwose.
He absolutely must.	Agomba rwose.
We didn’t have a lot of good food.	Ntabwo twari dufite ibiryo byiza byinshi.
On the phone now.	Kuri terefone nonaha.
He was the first to speak.	Niwe wa mbere wavuze.
He was embarrassed.	Yari afite isoni.
She is one girl.	Ni umukobwa umwe.
That was a great thing.	Ibyo byari ibintu byiza cyane.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Apparently he tried to find time.	Biragaragara ko yagerageje kubona umwanya.
That's right.	Nukuri.
And he.	Na we.
We have a lot to learn.	Dufite byinshi byo kwiga.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
Everything was fine.	Ibintu byose byari byiza.
And that's right.	Kandi uko ni ukuri.
I can't help it.	Ntabwo nshobora gufasha.
There are things.	Hariho ibintu.
And he loved food.	Kandi yakundaga cyane abantu ibiryo.
Quit.	Kureka.
Then he will do it.	Icyo gihe azabikora.
It’s not ‘for me, man.	Ntabwo ari 'kuri njye, muntu.
Either way, here it is.	Ibyo ari byo byose, hano ni.
I know the day.	Nzi umunsi.
But he had a lot to eat.	Ariko yari afite byinshi byo kurya.
Maybe he shouldn’t have come here.	Birashoboka ko atari akwiye kuza hano.
He could have been one.	Yashoboraga kuba umwe.
You can really do a lot.	Urashobora rwose gukora byinshi.
Glad to be one of the many.	Nishimiye kuba umwe muri benshi.
The young man is an expert.	Umusore ni umuhanga.
He was not expecting problems.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ibibazo.
He heard it from a young age on the phone.	Yumvise akiri muto kuri terefone.
I know it is.	Nzi ko ari.
How to know things.	Uburyo bwo kumenya ibintu.
Everything was easy.	Byose byari byoroshye.
Each of us could go where we wanted to.	Buri wese muri twe yashoboraga kujya aho ashaka.
It's just close.	Ni hafi gusa.
The car started working normally.	Imodoka yatangiye gukora bisanzwe.
He has it all.	Afite byose.
He must hurry.	Agomba vuba.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
It's up to him.	Ni kuri we.
That was not enough.	Ntabwo byari bihagije.
You have to learn to eat.	Ugomba kwiga kurya.
Or a girl.	Cyangwa umukobwa.
That is a mistake.	Ibyo ni amakosa.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
He wants something.	Ashaka ikintu.
I think of him.	Ndatekereza kuri we.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, ibi birashoboka rwose.
And he probably has the truth.	Kandi birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
You saw.	Wabonye.
She may want to live together.	Ashobora gushaka kubana.
The problem was that they were right.	Ikibazo nuko bari ukuri.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
All day long	Umunsi wose.
I don't think so.	Ntekereza ko nta na kimwe muri byo.
You know something.	Hari icyo uzi.
They have the same thing.	Bafite ikintu kimwe.
I'm sure this is the case.	Nzi neza ko ibi.
And every day.	Kandi buri munsi.
It's not close.	Ntabwo ari hafi.
To see	Kubona.
It has been a very short time.	Yamaze igihe gito cyane.
She was beautiful and beautiful.	Yari mwiza kandi mwiza.
I did a lot.	Nakoze cyane.
.	.
She was really nice.	Yari mwiza rwose.
At the moment.	Kuri iki gihe.
He used to catch.	Yakundaga gufata.
Or a little boy.	Cyangwa umuhungu muto.
Who you want to be.	Uwo ushaka kuba we.
People are people.	Abantu ni abantu.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
He knew he had to do something quick.	Yari azi ko agomba gukora ikintu vuba.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
You never did that alone.	Ntacyo wigeze ukora wenyine.
He did not know why.	Ntiyari azi neza impamvu.
As if it were true.	Nkaho ari ukuri.
No need to think about his father.	Nta mpamvu yo gutekereza kuri se.
Not all people are experts.	Ntabwo abantu bose ari umuhanga.
But it would be close.	Ariko byaba hafi.
It will be really good.	Bizaba byiza rwose.
You want to, but you can't.	Ushaka, ariko ntushobora.
You have to think hard.	Ugomba gutekereza cyane.
The problem is, he has no family.	Ikibazo nuko, adafite umuryango.
I have a new plan.	Ndi gahunda nshya.
This is it now.	Ubu ni ubu.
We are good to go.	Turi byiza kugenda.
It was all his idea.	Byari igitekerezo cye cyose.
That's fine with me.	Nibyiza nanjye.
But he loved his family.	Ariko yakundaga umuryango we.
It was a problem for me.	Byari ikibazo kuri njye.
You are doing what you have to do.	Urimo ukora ibyo ugomba gukora.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko ari byiza.
I wanted to go home.	Nashakaga gutaha.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
In fact it is.	Mubyukuri ni.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, birasa neza.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
I didn't need to.	Sinari nkeneye.
I think it was hard for him to do.	Ntekereza ko byari bigoye kuri we gukora.
He loved things.	Yakundaga ibintu.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
Little girl	Umukobwa muto.
He is ashamed.	Afite isoni.
You did it before.	Wabikoze mbere.
You have to.	Ugomba.
We have to do it.	Tugomba kubikora.
That's all he wants to do.	Ibyo aribyo byose ashaka gukora.
But he had a lot to do that day.	Ariko yari afite byinshi byo gukora uwo munsi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I know for sure.	Nzi neza rwose.
Tell me what you want.	Mbwira icyo ushaka.
I'm not sure what they were up to.	Sinzi neza icyo bari cyo.
Most of all.	Byinshi muri byose.
And it's a great time.	Kandi ni igihe cyiza cyane.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
This is what we are here for.	Ibi nibyo turi hano.
Maybe he's here.	Birashoboka ko ari hano.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
All of this is possible.	Ibyo byose birashoboka.
Much is clear here.	Byinshi biragaragara hano.
He must have gone too fast or something.	Agomba kuba yagiye vuba cyane cyangwa ikindi kintu.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Igihe cyo kureba niba koko ari inshuti yawe.
I feel really good.	Numva ari byiza rwose.
I was three years old.	Nari mfite imyaka itatu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo byose byari.
We didn't need to.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye.
But, the plan is really good.	Ariko, gahunda nziza mubyukuri.
She is a teacher.	Ni umwarimu.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I hope someone can help.	Ndizera ko umuntu ashobora gufasha.
But in the end, there's a lot you can do.	Ariko amaherezo, hari byinshi ushobora gukora.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
But you alone.	Ariko wowe wenyine.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
It wasn't good, but it was good.	Ntabwo byari byiza, ariko byari byiza.
And it wasn't bad enough.	Kandi ntabwo yari mubi bihagije.
I think that's a good idea.	Ntekereza ko ari igitekerezo cyiza.
Maybe he can drive.	Ahari arashobora gutwara.
I got to talk to you a lot.	Nabonye kubona kuvugana nawe cyane.
If not for him, no.	Niba atari we, ntabwo.
It looks like.	Birasa nkaho.
It's a problem.	Ni ikibazo.
He needed to be away from here.	Yari akeneye kuba kure aha.
All this.	Ibi byose.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
I like more than food.	Nkunda ibyo kuruta kurya.
He did something.	Hari icyo yakoze.
At first he felt scared.	Bwa mbere yumvise ubwoba.
But he had to be ready.	Ariko yagombaga kuba yiteguye.
No one would hear what he was saying.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari kumva ibyo avuga.
He did really well.	Yakoze neza rwose.
We have to go help.	Tugomba kujya gufasha.
He did not hear a room in his room.	Nta cyumba yumvise mu cyumba cye.
So far, it is possible.	Kugeza ubu, birashoboka.
It was not uncommon for him.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe kuri we.
You have to find my plan.	Ugomba kubona gahunda yanjye.
This looks bad.	Ibi birasa nabi.
If.	Niba.
I have no idea.	Ntabwo mfite igitekerezo gito.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
It's really good, you know how good it was.	Mubyukuri nibyiza, uzi uko byari byiza.
You know where he is.	Uzi aho ari.
I got to live with you.	Nabonye kubana nawe.
And he can do it.	Kandi arashobora kubikora.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
He had no reason.	Ntabwo yari afite impamvu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo ari ukuri ubu.
I saw.	Nabonye.
I never thought about that.	Sinigeze ntekereza kuri ibyo.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
Or maybe everything was all right.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko byose byari byose.
If not today, soon.	Niba atari uyu munsi, vuba.
I have all that.	Nanjye mfite ibyo byose.
I was bad.	Nari mubi.
I guess boy.	Ndakeka umuhungu.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
Everything you have to do is up to you.	Ibyo ugomba gukora byose niwowe.
We have to play hard.	Tugomba gukina cyane.
Everyone did something.	Buri wese yagize icyo akora.
That's not what he wanted to hear.	Ntabwo aribyo yashakaga kumva.
It was easy.	Byari ibintu byoroshye.
You can't find more truth than this.	Ntushobora kubona ukuri kurenza ibi.
I am now an outsider.	Ubu ndi umuntu wo hanze.
Going to do it tomorrow.	Kujya kubikora ejo.
He wants more.	Ashaka byinshi.
No one is involved.	Nta muntu urimo.
I saw a lot of mistakes.	Nabonye amakosa menshi.
He likes to work.	Akunda gukora.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I'm taking it.	Ndimo gufata.
You don’t even have to do it very well.	Ntugomba no kubikora neza cyane.
It is not too early to do so.	Ntabwo ari kare cyane kubikora.
He was very young and scared.	Yari muto cyane kandi afite ubwoba.
He thought now.	Yatekereje ubu.
We needed to take that.	Twari dukeneye kujyana ibyo.
This one really was.	Uyu rwose yari.
I'm going to wait here.	Ngiye gutegereza hano.
I should have gone home.	Nari nkwiye gutaha.
Not years.	Ntabwo ari imyaka.
This was a mistake.	Ibi byari amakosa.
It seems.	Birasa.
They were really high.	Nukuri bari hejuru cyane.
I don't like him.	Ntabwo nkunda muri we.
Many children.	Abana benshi.
Does it seem easy?	Birasa nkaho byoroshye?.
There is something else, something absolutely.	Hariho ikindi kintu na kimwe, ikintu rwose.
I am not young.	Ntabwo ndi muto.
Only in.	Gusa muri.
Definitely a food for thought.	Rwose ibiryo byo gutekereza.
I saw the same thing.	Nanjye nabonye kimwe.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
We all have.	Twese dufite.
In front there is a phone.	Imbere hari terefone.
Everything will be fine now.	Ibintu byose bizaba byiza ubu.
Something to go back to.	Ikintu cyo gusubira inyuma.
I like parties.	Nkunda ibirori.
Absolutely.	Nukuri mubyukuri.
Movie time.	Igihe cya firime.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
He is doing well on his own.	Arimo akora neza wenyine wenyine.
He would eat something.	Yari kurya ikintu.
Really, really.	Mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
He never had a family.	Ntabwo yigeze agira umuryango.
We now have a child.	Ubu dufite umwana.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
It's not easy at all.	Ntabwo byoroshye na gato.
Nor is it a mistake.	Ntabwo kandi ari amakosa.
There are children.	Hariho abana.
It was great to be your son.	Byari byiza cyane kuba umuhungu wawe.
You know he has.	Uzi neza ko afite.
This would be another matter.	Ibi byaba ari ikindi kintu.
His father would not be good.	Se ntiyari kuba mwiza.
That's all the boy can think of.	Ibyo aribyo byose umuhungu ashobora gutekereza.
And that's right.	Kandi ibyo ni byo.
It was very close.	Byari hafi cyane.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
He went where I am.	Yagiye aho ndi.
Someone close to you.	Umuntu nawe hafi.
Nothing looks like me.	Nta kintu na kimwe asa nkanjye.
I can't think straight.	Sinshobora gutekereza neza.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
And it was great advice.	Kandi yari inama nziza cyane.
Lots and lots of parties.	Ibirori byinshi kandi byinshi.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I enjoy this time.	Nishimiye iki gihe.
You are, and you have a long time.	Uri, kandi ufite igihe kirekire.
And like his father.	Kandi nka se.
That's great right now.	Nibyiza cyane ubu.
We have to listen.	Tugomba kumva.
I don't know what to do now.	Sinzi icyo gukora ubu.
Anyone can help.	Umuntu wese ashobora gufasha.
I have to learn not to do it.	Ngomba kwiga kutabikora.
If he really has a plan.	Niba rwose afite gahunda.
They would not watch or talk to anyone.	Ntabwo bari kureba cyangwa kuvugana numuntu.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He did not know where he was.	Ntabwo yari azi aho ari.
There are a lot of people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi.
Good things.	Ibintu byiza.
Only children, or children.	Abana gusa, cyangwa abana.
He was scared, he was worried.	Yari afite ubwoba, yari afite impungenge.
He would not come.	Ntiyari kuza.
I can't say enough good things about him.	Sinshobora kuvuga ibintu byiza bihagije kuri we.
Maybe it's us.	Birashoboka ko ari twe.
You have to go.	Ugomba kugenda.
It was good, very good.	Byari byiza, byiza cyane.
I have to go home now.	Ubu ngomba gutaha.
And that's right.	Kandi ibyo ni byo.
Apparently he had problems.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ibibazo.
I love the good question !.	Nkunda ikibazo cyiza!.
Eventually, it happened.	Amaherezo, byagenze.
It was all too much.	Byose byari byinshi cyane.
I don't like it very much.	Ntabwo nkunda cyane.
He was very lucky.	Yagize amahirwe menshi kubyo.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
You like to play.	Ukunda gukina.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
He was not afraid.	Ntabwo yari afite ubwoba.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
That is my child.	Uwo ni umwana wanjye.
There is truth in truth.	Hariho ukuri kuri kuri.
It's just money.	Ni amafaranga gusa.
I thought that.	Natekereje ko.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa, birashoboka ko atari byo.
We didn't need to.	Ntabwo twari dukeneye.
Always behind him.	Buri gihe inyuma ye.
Either way, it’s a good thing.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ni ikintu cyiza.
I was not out.	Ntabwo nari hanze.
I don't know what to do now.	Ubu sinzi icyo gukora.
With us.	Natwe.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
He may even be on top.	Ashobora no kuba hejuru.
He didn't want to be around.	Ntiyashakaga ko aba hafi.
It was a small idea.	Byari igitekerezo gito.
You can do it again.	Urashobora kongera kubikora.
I only have one thing.	Mfite ikintu gusa.
Maybe he should.	Birashoboka ko agomba.
You can only do so for a long time.	Urashobora kubikora gusa igihe kirekire.
And he did well.	Kandi yakoze neza.
And wait.	Kandi gutegereza.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
I really like what you do.	Nkunda cyane ibyo ukora.
I really understand this.	Nukuri ndumva ibi.
He just didn't know what to do.	Gusa ntabwo yari azi neza icyo gukora.
Or her hair.	Cyangwa umusatsi we.
You may also be able to get help.	Birashoboka ko nawe ushobora kubona ubufasha.
But that is not the case.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
He could hear nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kumva.
He never did.	Ntabwo yigeze abikora.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe no kurya.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo aribyo.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
Let him be young.	Reka akiri muto.
I felt scared.	Numvise mfite ubwoba.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
It would be difficult.	Byaba bigoye.
I doubt if there is much to see.	Ndashidikanya niba hari byinshi byo kubona.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
It seems.	Birasa.
Nothing wrong here.	Hano nta kintu kibi.
It seems to be true.	Asa n'ukuri.
So far so good.	Kugeza ubu birasa neza.
But we can't stop now.	Ariko ntidushobora kureka ubu.
But until then.	Ariko kugeza icyo gihe.
It's great for everyone.	Nibyiza cyane umuntu wese.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
I think we need to talk more about that here.	Ntekereza ko dukeneye kuvuga byinshi kuri ibyo hano.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I had nothing.	Ntacyo nari mfite.
He hadn't thought of anything to say.	Ntiyari yatekereje ikintu na kimwe avuga.
This was a mistake.	Ibi byari amakosa.
She was a beautiful, beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza, mwiza.
You have to go tonight.	Ugomba kugenda muri iri joro.
I never thought he would do it.	Sinigeze ntekereza rwose ko azabikora.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
Book, maybe.	Igitabo, ahari.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
I feel like it's too much.	Numva ari byinshi cyane.
He will not do it.	Ntabwo azabikora.
Of course, this was a great plan.	Nibyo, iyi yari gahunda nziza cyane.
I can't understand.	Ntashobora kumva.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
And he is my friend.	Kandi ni inshuti yanjye.
The young man thought he knew everything.	Umusore yibwiraga ko azi byose.
I'm not close to that.	Ntabwo ndi hafi muri ibyo.
No meetings, no jobs.	Nta nama, nta kazi.
Mary is far away.	Mariya ari kure.
I don't know if that is true.	Sinzi ko ibyo ari ukuri.
I can do that again.	Nshobora kongera kugira ibyo.
I don't want to buy it now.	Sinshaka kugura ubu.
You can do everything right.	Urashobora gukora byose neza.
We really should.	Tugomba rwose.
But he had to do something.	Ariko yagombaga kugira icyo akora.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
And she is a beautiful girl.	Kandi ni umukobwa mwiza.
Before eating	Mbere yo kurya.
'.	'.
Everyone knew who he was.	Abantu bose bari bazi uwo ari we.
But things went well.	Ariko ibintu byagenze neza.
Especially the girl.	Cyane cyane umukobwa.
But we must be.	Ariko tugomba kuba.
He went swimming first.	Yagiye koga mbere.
He went home.	Yagiye gutaha.
He went like this.	Yagiye gutya.
At the time, he was scared.	Icyo gihe yari afite ubwoba.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
We have to have more.	Tugomba kugira byinshi.
Or what he can't.	Cyangwa icyo adashobora.
You go tomorrow.	Ugiye ejo.
He seemed scared.	Yasaga naho yari afite ubwoba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Who? 	Ninde?
This early.	Iyi kare kare.
She thought she was a beautiful girl.	Yatekereje ko umukobwa mwiza.
He must have.	Agomba kugira.
I need to go back.	Nkeneye gusubira inyuma.
Obviously this is not his time to play.	Biragaragara ko iki atari igihe cye cyo gukina.
And he was alone.	Kandi yari wenyine.
When a child is young.	Iyo umwana akiri muto.
It was a real problem.	Byari ikibazo rwose.
It's his thing.	Ni ikintu cye.
He saw the problem and was right.	Yabonye ikibazo kandi yari afite ukuri.
He has a gift.	Impano afite.
But he probably can't.	Ariko birashoboka ko adashobora.
They were upstairs.	Bari hejuru.
I think he is right.	Ndatekereza ko afite ukuri.
This is not a close issue.	Iki ntabwo ari ikibazo hafi.
We have to wait.	Tugomba gutegereza.
And you are so beautiful.	Kandi uri mwiza cyane.
This is probably not what you want.	Ibi birashoboka ko atari byo ushaka.
He was everything.	Byose yari we.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo.
That’s when I saw it all.	Icyo gihe nabonye twese.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu cyo kuvuga.
It was really nice and good to be together like that.	Byari byiza rwose kandi byiza kubana hamwe gutya.
He is my son.	Ni umuhungu wanjye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He did not want to see.	Ntiyashakaga kubona.
But for us.	Ariko kuri twe.
At that time he knew what it was.	Icyo gihe yari azi icyo aricyo.
It's good to be back.	Nibyiza gusubira hano.
Eventually it would work.	Amaherezo byari gukora.
When we were so close.	Mugihe twari hafi cyane.
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
A lot to do, a lot to do.	Byinshi byo gukora, byinshi byo gukora.
This is a great thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza cyane.
Or we can do something else.	Cyangwa dushobora gukora ikindi kintu.
That's not the point.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu.
Prison food was good.	Ibiryo byo muri gereza byari byiza.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
All of this is good and good.	Ibi byose ni byiza kandi ni byiza.
He thought quickly.	Yatekereje vuba.
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
A time to think deeply.	Igihe cyo gutekereza cyane.
I also want to.	Nanjye ndashaka.
I wanted to go back.	Nashakaga gusubira inyuma.
I have a long, long time.	Mfite igihe kirekire, kirekire.
He did not expect this.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ibi.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba gukora neza.
It's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
There is more to it.	Hariho byinshi kuri byo.
I ask if he thinks of me.	Ndabaza niba atekereza kuri njye.
He has to go the way he is.	Agomba kugenda uko ari.
Same problem.	Ikibazo kimwe.
I finally realized that.	Amaherezo nabonye ko.
You have to listen.	Ugomba kumva.
You can't go wrong.	Ntushobora kugenda nabi.
But it would be nice.	Ariko byari kuba byiza.
It will be easier soon.	Bizaba byoroshye vuba.
That's all you can do.	Ibyo aribyo byose ushobora gukora.
You don't do much.	Ntacyo ukora cyane.
We can't.	Ntabwo dushobora.
He is right.	Yaba afite ukuri.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo yari akeneye.
He also has a speech problem.	Nawe afite ikibazo cyo kuvuga.
She is just a child.	Ni umwana gusa.
I was an expert.	Nari umuhanga.
I thought this would be great.	Natekereje ko ibi byaba byiza.
He has money.	Afite amafaranga.
I guess not.	Ndakeka ko atari byo.
You always need that.	Buri gihe ukeneye ibyo.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
All of this was high.	Ibi byose byari hejuru.
He needed help.	Yari akeneye ubufasha.
This is a concern.	Ibi ni impungenge.
This one was beautiful.	Uyu yari mwiza.
But there are things to watch.	Ariko hariho ibintu byo kureba.
But he did not know what to do.	Ariko ntiyari azi icyo.
If you want to go, you have to do it.	Niba ushaka kugenda, ugomba kubikora.
Nearby.	Hafi ya hafi.
His family had nothing.	Umuryango we ntacyo wari ufite.
I just wanted to.	Nashakaga gusa.
'	'
This is not exactly the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
And hey, that's good.	Kandi we, ibyo nibyiza.
Once backwards.	Rimwe gusubira inyuma.
However, in many cases that is not the case.	Ariko, muri benshi ntabwo aribyo.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Chance to win.	Amahirwe yo gutsinda.
And it wouldn’t have happened.	Kandi ntabwo byari kuba.
He must.	Agomba.
This was a lot.	Ibi byari byinshi.
It was just an opportunity.	Byari amahirwe gusa.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
Simple, you can say.	Byoroshye, ushobora kuvuga.
There is a young man.	Hari umusore.
He bought it with me.	Yaguze nanjye.
The guy is really good.	Umusore mubyukuri ni mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
However, there is help.	Ariko, hariho ubufasha.
Nothing good to do.	Nta kintu cyiza cyo gukora.
That's all there is to it.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu cyose.
He was not the one at the time.	Ntabwo ari we icyo gihe.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu igitekerezo.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
Nothing for me here.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri njye hano.
This is all for us.	Ibi ni byose kuri twe.
You really have to go one day.	Ugomba rwose kugenda umunsi umwe.
Let it be, let it be.	Reka, reka uwo.
It started later.	Yatangiye nyuma.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
At no time did he want to know more.	Nta na rimwe, yashakaga kumenya byinshi.
But this is another time.	Ariko ibi ikindi gihe.
But there is not much to see.	Ariko nta byinshi byo kubona.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
They were children.	Bari abana.
If you also have children.	Niba kandi ufite abana.
He was absolutely right.	Yari afite ukuri rwose.
I knew it was not my fault.	Nari nzi ko atari amakosa yanjye.
You can find out more here !.	Urashobora kumenya byinshi hano hano!.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
Very good.	Cyiza cyane.
There are many gifts here.	Hano hari impano nyinshi.
Or at all times.	Cyangwa igihe cyose.
He was the one who could think of everything.	Kuri byose yashoboraga gutekereza ni we.
I had an idea.	Nagize igitekerezo.
I need to stay	Nkeneye kuguma.
He didn’t even have a plan to go back.	Ntiyari afite na gahunda yo gusubira inyuma.
That's not what he saw.	Ntabwo aribyo yabonye.
I worked all day.	Nakoze umunsi wose.
Not a lot of job opportunities.	Ntabwo amahirwe menshi yo gushaka akazi.
I'm sure he knows how you think.	Nzi neza ko azi uko utekereza.
You have to do this.	Ugomba gukora ibi.
Before eating, in fact.	Mbere yo kurya, mubyukuri.
And it was high.	Kandi byari hejuru.
I hope it is a good thing for her.	Nizere ko ari ikintu cyiza kuri we.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
He does things well.	Akora ibintu neza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
And no one for me.	Kandi nta n'umwe kuri njye.
I'm really glad to see that.	Nishimiye rwose kubona ibyo.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Eventually, he chose a plan.	Amaherezo, yahisemo gahunda.
He wanted to win.	Yashakaga gutsinda.
It's not time.	Ntabwo ari igihe.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Probably not you.	Birashoboka ko atari wowe.
I am worried every day, every day.	Mfite impungenge buri munsi, buri munsi.
I can't today.	Sinshobora uyu munsi.
He said they were early.	Yavuze ko bari kare.
However, there is another problem.	Ariko, hariho ikindi kibazo.
And sooner or later it is good.	Kandi vuba vuba nibyiza.
This is not normal.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
That is not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibintu.
Near me.	Hafi yanjye.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
But it was too high for him.	Ariko byari hejuru cyane kuri we.
That's all there is to it.	Ibyo aribyo byose mubyukuri.
He took another drink.	Yafashe ikindi kunywa.
He had no house.	Nta nzu yari afite.
She feels very thoughtful.	Yumva atekereza cyane.
No one is good or bad.	Nta muntu mwiza cyangwa mubi.
That is not possible.	Ibyo ntabwo bishoboka.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
Not if you are a woman.	Ntabwo niba uri umugore.
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
You really can't.	Mubyukuri ntushobora.
The first idea is true.	Igitekerezo cya mbere nukuri.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu ntabwo aribyo.
You have to go back.	Ugomba gusubira inyuma.
For all that, it looks like.	Kuri byose, birasa.
He never thought.	Ntiyigeze atekereza.
He enjoyed my day.	Yishimiye umunsi wanjye.
He didn't say anything wrong.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari yavuze nabi.
I didn't know all this.	Ntabwo nari nzi ibi byose.
It's not difficult at all.	Ntabwo bigoye na gato.
Everyone at work.	Umuntu wese ku kazi.
We have everyone.	Dufite abantu bose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, gusa birashoboka.
This was very easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye cyane.
You don't have to be bad.	Ntugomba kuba mubi.
And that's a lot.	Kandi ni byinshi rwose.
Knowing is a good thing.	Kumenya ni ikintu cyiza.
He did not know how high they were.	Ntiyari azi uko bari hejuru.
Your good guy.	Umusore wawe mwiza.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
Inside there is a prior knowledge.	Imbere hari kumenya mbere.
This one.	Uyu.
And it's not money.	Kandi ntabwo ari amafaranga.
It would be great.	Byari kuba ibintu byiza cyane.
For the most part.	Kuri benshi cyane.
The money came in a very short time.	Amafaranga yaje igihe gito cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
That was good in the morning.	Ibyo byari byiza mu gitondo.
I'm not sure we need anything else.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko dukeneye ikindi.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
I can't wait to read more.	Sinshobora gutegereza gusoma byinshi.
If he said something that was true, it was true.	Niba yavuze ikintu ari ukuri, byari ukuri.
The worst part is here.	Ikintu kibi cyane hano.
I feel his family.	Numva umuryango we.
Just on my phone.	Gusa kuri terefone yanjye.
This is not exactly the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I doubt he was alone.	Ndashidikanya ko yari wenyine.
I know we can do that, that's not the problem.	Nzi ko dushobora kubikora, ntabwo aricyo kibazo.
I really don't see it.	Ntabwo rwose mbona.
My favorite is the top.	Nkunda cyane ni hejuru hejuru.
Something nice and nice.	Ikintu cyiza kandi cyiza.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
He was not alone in that.	Ntiyari wenyine muri ibyo.
You were just a kid.	Wari umwana gusa.
It's down.	Bari hasi.
You can go home.	Urashobora gutaha.
Inside was his wife.	Imbere yari umugore we.
He could have done it for no reason.	Yashoboraga kubikora nta mpamvu.
Her son was right.	Umuhungu we yari afite ukuri.
His wife.	Umugore we.
He was still in her.	Yari akiri muri we.
It's the same with you.	Birasa nawe.
One has to do it.	Umuntu agomba kuba abikora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
And he went.	Kandi yagiye.
But that was the plan.	Ariko iyo yari gahunda.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni cyo kibazo.
It's not just that you look.	Ntabwo ari uko usa gusa.
And for me.	Kandi kuri njye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It all happened.	Byose byagenze.
He later left.	Nyuma yaje kugenda.
None of this I did.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo nakoze.
not like him.	ntabwo ari nka we.
I understand why.	Ndumva impamvu.
I was at work.	Nari ku kazi.
He is a very similar person.	Ni umuntu usa cyane.
It is also possible to eat something.	Birashoboka kandi kurya ikintu.
One could shop nearby.	Umuntu yashoboraga kugura hafi.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
We are a small family.	Turi umuryango muto.
But everything went wrong.	Ariko ibintu byose byagenze nabi.
Nothing here.	Hano nta kintu na kimwe.
Or so far.	Cyangwa kugeza ubu.
Well, it was good.	Nibyo, byari byiza.
He said he did not know for sure.	Yavuze ko atari azi neza.
Bad living.	Kubaho nabi.
Being there.	Kuba ahari.
I never believed in anything.	Sinigeze nizera ikintu na kimwe.
It was a long time.	Byari igihe kirekire.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko byari byiza.
You can't get a job.	Ntushobora kubona akazi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo rwose impungenge hano.
He had accepted the faith.	Yari yemeye kwizera.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
I'm coming.	Ngiye kuza.
He did not know why he was here.	Ntiyari azi impamvu yari hano.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose kugeza ubu.
But this one.	Ariko iyi.
He may be really good.	Ashobora kuba mwiza rwose.
There are chances when you want to take it.	Hariho amahirwe mugihe ushaka gufata.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I don't want money.	Sinshaka amafaranga.
However, there is more.	Ariko, hariho byinshi.
It is the same for everyone.	Ni kimwe kuri bose.
And he wants to talk.	Kandi arashaka kuvuga.
But I really don't know.	Ariko mubyukuri nzi ko atari byo.
It was something else.	Yari ikindi kintu.
I need your car.	Nkeneye imodoka yawe.
I have a job recently.	Mfite akazi vuba aha.
And it's not money.	Kandi ntabwo ari amafaranga.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
He has a gift.	Afite impano.
It is not difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye.
It’s really something we can drink.	Nukuri mubyukuri ikintu dushobora kunywa.
He was not there.	Ntiyari ahari.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
All alone.	Byose wenyine.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
He was about thirty years old.	Yari afite hafi imyaka mirongo itatu.
It was too much for many.	Byari byinshi cyane kuri benshi.
I have to be the one to watch.	Ngomba kuba uwo kureba.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko iki gihe bafite ukuri.
For me it is outside.	Kuri njye ni hanze.
Learn more, go back.	Kwiga byinshi, gusubira inyuma.
He had his plan.	Yari afite gahunda ye.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
I heard it soon.	Numvise vuba.
He was going to do it.	Yari agiye kubikora.
Everything is clear.	Ibintu byose biragaragara.
I didn’t know how that was true.	Sinari nzi uburyo ibyo byari ukuri.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
If anyone can help that would be great.	Niba hari ushobora gufasha ibyo byaba byiza.
All of this is recent.	Ibi byose ni vuba aha.
That's what he wanted to be.	Uwo ni we yashakaga kuba.
It is not us.	Ntabwo ari twe.
I didn’t know the boy very well.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza umuhungu.
Work every day while he was there.	Akazi buri munsi mugihe yari ahari.
He can be friends with anyone.	Ashobora kuba inshuti n'umuntu uwo ari we wese.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
I thought you were a friend.	Natekereje ko uri inshuti.
It wouldn't have happened now.	Ntabwo byari kubaho ubu.
He wanted to know everything about us.	Yashakaga kumenya byose kuri twe.
He knows something.	Hari icyo azi.
I was a girl.	Nari umukobwa.
We all have time.	Twese dufite igihe.
And that's right.	Kandi nibyo.
I thought he was really good.	Natekerezaga ko yari mwiza rwose.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
He had to be here.	Yagombaga kuba hano.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
We are where we are.	Turi aho turi.
He didn’t really want to have it.	Ntiyashakaga rwose kugira.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
He has questions of faith.	Afite ibibazo byo kwizera.
You don't look good.	Ntabwo usa neza.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I wanted to look away.	Nashakaga kureba kure.
Everyone has the first fear of acting.	Umuntu wese afite ubwoba bwa mbere akora.
It's just one thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe gusa.
My wife is looking for a baby.	Umugore wanjye arashaka umwana.
That was it.	Icyo yari cyo.
A young child.	Umwana muto.
I like to do it with you.	Nkunda kubikora nawe.
I'm worried.	Mfite impungenge.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
You can't come here.	Ntushobora kuza hano.
Trying to do more.	Kugerageza gukora byinshi.
It was a great time for me.	Wari umwanya mwiza cyane kuri njye.
There is a gift for work here.	Hano hari impano ku kazi.
It will be together.	Bizaba hamwe.
My wife is gone.	Umugore wanjye yagiye.
You are smart.	Ufite ubwenge.
Questions.	Ibibazo.
She could be a very, very beautiful girl.	Ashobora kuba umukobwa mwiza cyane, mwiza.
I need to know if this is possible.	Nkeneye kumenya niba bishoboka.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I want my money.	Ndashaka amafaranga yanjye.
It would be great !.	Byaba byiza rwose!.
And that is very difficult to do.	Kandi ko ibyo bigoye cyane gukora.
Seeing you want me to be like you.	Kubona ushaka ko nkanjye.
One of the many, obviously.	Kimwe muri byinshi, biragaragara.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo ari ukuri.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea.	Sinzi neza niba iki ari igitekerezo cyiza.
At home all day.	Murugo umunsi wose.
It's stuff.	Ni ibintu.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And you can't go wrong.	Kandi ntushobora kugenda nabi.
For her, she has to feel like her daughter.	Kuri we, agomba kumva ari umukobwa we.
I used to be that person.	Nigeze kuba uwo muntu.
He may have.	Ashobora kuba afite.
He does not.	Ntabwo abikora.
This is absolutely true.	Ibi rwose ni ukuri.
It was good to try.	Byari byiza kugerageza.
We were very close.	Twari hafi cyane.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
You have to take it with you as you go.	Ugomba kujyana nawe mugihe ugiye.
Very easy, no.	Byoroshye cyane, ntabwo.
Especially if it's someone close to you.	Cyane cyane niba ari umuntu uri hafi yawe.
he said.	yavuze.
I have to go back.	Ngomba gusubira inyuma.
But there is no need to wait too long.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo gutegereza byinshi.
I like to study.	Nkunda kwiga.
He could only see her playing with him.	Yashoboraga kubona arimo gukina na we gusa.
Apparently he meant problems.	Biragaragara ko yashakaga kuvuga ibibazo.
He is too young for me.	Ari muto cyane kuri njye.
For him, the plan is everything.	Kuri we, gahunda ni byose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He thinks he has.	Yibwira ko afite.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
They were nearby.	Bari hafi aho.
Anyone was a problem.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese wari ikibazo.
He thought things were going well.	Yatekereje ko ibintu byiza.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
The wait was over.	Gutegereza byari byinshi kuva mbere.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
He saw a lot of people.	Yabonye abantu benshi.
Good if but.	Nibyiza niba ariko.
You can request anything you want.	Urashobora gusaba ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose ushaka.
They have a reason.	Bafite impamvu.
When you know someone, you know someone.	Iyo uzi umuntu, uzi umuntu.
You want to know everything.	Ushaka kumenya byose.
Time is short.	Igihe ni gito.
I like to go.	Nkunda kugenda.
He should have been there.	Yari akwiye kuba ahari.
He did not want them to do so.	Ntiyashakaga ko abikora.
You can do it at home.	Urashobora kubikora murugo.
I don't want to eat anything.	Sinshaka kurya ikintu na kimwe.
It's as low as possible.	Ari hasi cyane bishoboka.
He would not be there.	Ntabwo yari kuba ahari.
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka hano.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
He didn't need to know.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kumenya.
He can't, he never will.	Ntashobora, ntazigera abikora.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
You know what you're up to.	Uzi icyo uri cyo kuri njye.
And sometimes, you just can't seem to get enough of it.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe, ntushobora kubona ibintu neza.
She was still beautiful.	Yari akiri mwiza.
He looked at his age.	Yarebye imyaka ye.
What he had to do.	Icyo yagombaga.
It’s not just food.	Ntabwo ari ibiryo gusa.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
You can't trust someone like him.	Ntushobora kwizera umuntu nka we.
It was also a new plan for me.	Byari kandi gahunda nshya kuri njye.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
He wants to make a movie.	Ashaka gukora firime.
This was a little high.	Ibi byari hejuru gato.
He asked to speak to her.	Yasabye kuvugana na we.
In fact, he never did.	Mubyukuri ntabwo yigeze abikora.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
You can go to jail.	Urashobora kujya muri gereza.
The truth.	Ukuri.
There was nothing that anyone could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe umuntu yashoboraga gukora.
You know nothing.	Nta cyo uzi.
Good thing here.	Ikintu cyiza hano.
It seems.	Birasa.
I don't know what it is.	Ntazi icyo aricyo.
This was his place.	Uyu wari umwanya we.
'	'
Everyone wanted money.	Umuntu wese yashakaga amafaranga.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
But, you are also human.	Ariko, nawe uri umuntu.
He said he had none.	Yavuze ko nta na kimwe yari afite.
Well, here it was, whatever it was.	Nibyiza, hano byari, ibyo aribyo byose.
It seems like a lot of people have this problem.	Birasa nkaho hari abantu benshi bafite iki kibazo.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I don't have to do this.	Ntabwo ngomba gukora ibi.
He did not say what he would do about the situation.	Ntabwo yari yavuze icyo yari gukora ku kibazo cye.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
Maybe he can.	Ahari arashobora.
Or maybe it was easier than that.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko byari byoroshye kurenza ibyo.
Today, it was easy.	Uyu munsi, byari byoroshye.
It's, after all, just a movie.	Ni, nyuma ya byose, ni firime gusa.
You are.	Urimo.
Everything I do.	Ibyo nkora byose.
It would be easy.	Byaba byoroshye.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
But this was good.	Ariko ibi byari byiza.
But it is true for all of us.	Ariko ni ukuri kuri twese.
He can't be alone.	Ntashobora kuba wenyine.
He wasn't sure if he wanted to go back.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ashaka gusubira inyuma.
It would be nice, or not.	Byaba byiza, cyangwa sibyo.
And you have to be ashamed.	Kandi ugomba kugira isoni.
That is not true today.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri muri iki gihe.
You are now a girl.	Ubu uri umukobwa.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
They probably knew something he didn't know.	Birashoboka ko bari bazi ikintu atazi.
The boy never had.	Umuhungu atigeze agira.
And not before.	Kandi si mbere.
And he has a daughter inside.	Kandi afite umukobwa imbere.
I mean, you might be alone.	Ndashaka kuvuga, birashoboka ko ushobora kuba wenyine.
It's good and alone.	Nibyiza kandi wenyine.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
He knew what had happened.	Yari azi uko byagenze.
Let's, let's.	Reka, reka.
We are especially.	Turi cyane cyane.
But that doesn't matter.	Ariko ibyo ntacyo.
I'm not sure how.	Sinzi neza uko.
I thought everyone had it.	Natekerezaga ko abantu bose bafite.
I wanted to be on top.	Nashakaga kuba hejuru.
Time is of the essence.	Igihe nukuri mubyukuri.
But nothing would have happened.	Ariko ntacyo byari kuba.
But very good.	Ariko mwiza cyane.
You were not beautiful.	Ntabwo wari mwiza.
I need to look into this.	Nkeneye kureba muri ibi.
That was good.	Ko byari byiza.
I believe he is right.	Ndizera ko afite ukuri.
His phone was on the front.	Terefone ye yari imbere.
Ngomba.	Ngomba.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
Your wife.	Umugore wawe.
That's not a bad idea at all.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo kibi rwose.
I haven't seen much.	Sinigeze mbona byinshi.
I have to try and work hard on it.	Ngomba kugerageza no gukora cyane kuri yo.
It looks great, but it's easy.	Birasa cyane, ariko byoroshye.
It was hard to do.	Byari bigoye kubikora.
He loves his young daughter.	Akunda umukobwa we muto.
It was great at the same time.	Byari ibintu byiza mugihe kimwe.
The problem with someone is the process of going backwards.	Ikibazo numuntu gahunda yo gusubira inyuma.
We have to think.	Tugomba gutekereza.
I once did a job.	Nigeze gukora akazi rimwe.
Nothing to hear.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kumva.
He seemed to be speechless.	Yasaga naho atazi kuvuga.
That is very possible.	Ibyo birashoboka cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I wanted to drop out of school.	Nashakaga kuva mu ishuri.
This worked out very well.	Ibi byagenze neza cyane.
You have to buy.	Ugomba kugura.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka gukora neza.
You have to go now.	Ugomba kugenda ubu.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi cyane byo gutekereza.
I think that’s the problem most people have.	Ntekereza ko icyo ari ikibazo abantu benshi bafite.
In reality, however, things are not easy.	Mubyukuri, ariko, ibintu ntabwo byoroshye.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
He must have been out.	Agomba kuba yari hanze.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
I'm going to try.	Ngiye kugerageza.
He knew the child.	Yari azi umwana.
Eating too much.	Kurya cyane.
This is it.	Uri iki.
Tell me everything	Mbwira byose.
Not to mention.	Nta kuvuga.
A boy needs to be close to his father.	Umuhungu akeneye kugira se hafi.
Maybe at that time.	Ahari icyo gihe.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
I can't do it, I want to do something else.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora, nshaka gukora ikindi.
I wouldn't know that.	Ntabwo nari kumenya uko.
Not really.	Mubyukuri sibyo.
It's not just me.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa.
This is a girl.	Uyu ni umukobwa.
That was in his time.	Ibyo byari mu gihe cye.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
He thought for a moment.	Yatekereje gato.
Or better yet, actually.	Cyangwa byiza, mubyukuri.
I want the truth.	Ndashaka ukuri.
Whoa, this is a good idea now.	Ninde, ubu iki ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Sometimes it is not.	Rimwe na rimwe sibyo.
No food.	Nta kurya.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
Life time.	Umwanya wo kubaho.
It started well.	Yatangiye neza.
He was old.	Yari afite imyaka.
He started asking for more.	Yatangiye gusaba byinshi.
Really well done.	Nukuri neza neza.
Stop doing everything.	Reka gukora byose.
That's not the case.	Ntabwo ari byo.
He wanted to do it.	Yashakaga kubikora.
He could say nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kuvuga.
Everyone had something for everyone.	Umuntu wese yari afite ikintu kuri buri wese.
His wife went alone.	Umugore we yagiye wenyine.
Take time.	Gufata umwanya.
It was almost everything he could ask for.	Byari ibintu hafi ya byose yashoboraga gusaba.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He once did something right.	Rimwe yigeze gukora ikintu neza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I got a plan.	Nabonye gahunda.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It will be a long time.	Azaba amaze igihe kinini.
That would not work.	Ibyo atari gukora.
You know you are.	Uzi ko uri.
Things are good.	Ibintu ni byiza.
You can't wait.	Ntushobora gutegereza.
You have to read on.	Ugomba gusoma kuri.
He thought it was not good enough for me.	Yatekereje ko atari byiza bihagije kuri njye.
He said he really needed to talk to me.	Yavuze ko akeneye rwose kuvugana nanjye.
They have friends.	Bafite inshuti.
You don't know exactly what happened.	Ntabwo uzi neza uko byagenze.
Tom also looked good.	Tom nawe biragaragara ko yasaga neza.
We have to stop this.	Tugomba kureka ibi.
He knows what he wants.	Azi icyo ashaka.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I have nothing here.	Ntacyo mfite hano.
You have an idea.	Ufite igitekerezo.
At that time he was dressed.	Icyo gihe yari yambaye imyenda.
They are worried.	Bafite impungenge.
We are not close.	Ntabwo turi hafi.
All the time, nothing.	Igihe cyose, ntacyo.
He tried to feel nothing.	Yagerageje kumva ntacyo.
But he said nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yavuze.
He knew that.	Ibyo yari azi.
The car was ready.	Imodoka yari yiteguye.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
It would not have been easy.	Ntabwo yari kugenda byoroshye.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza gusa kubyo.
I think he will.	Ndakeka yuko azabikora.
That is a very bad time.	Icyo gihe kibi cyane.
I can't do it normally.	Ntabwo nshobora gukora bisanzwe.
There is.	Hariho.
He just tried to think, instead.	Yagerageje gutekereza gusa, aho.
It was very difficult to do that.	Byari bigoye cyane kubikora.
Now he felt scared.	Ubu yumvise afite ubwoba.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
You need to hear.	Ukeneye kumva.
One has to be.	Umuntu agomba kuba.
We are all here.	Twese turi hano.
Sometimes it was true.	Rimwe na rimwe byari ukuri.
I thought we should.	Natekereje ko tugomba.
Quit the job.	Reka akazi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo.
But these two.	Ariko aba bombi.
Alone.	Wenyine.
I'm out.	Ndi hanze.
He is a good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He tried to do things on his own.	Yagerageje gukora ibintu wenyine.
He is a player.	Ni umukinnyi.
Here and there it is good and good.	Hano hano ni byiza kandi byiza.
I have one for him, there.	Mfite umwe kuri we, aho.
But you are doing well.	Ariko urimo ukora neza.
Not many people are out.	Ntabwo abantu benshi bari hanze.
And it is not his fault.	Kandi ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
He is coming again soon.	Agiye kongera kuza vuba.
The guy is very skilled.	Umusore ni umuhanga cyane.
There is a car.	Hariho imodoka.
A gift to me.	Impano kuri njye.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
We have to do it again.	Tugomba kongera kubikora.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I never wanted anything else.	Sinigeze nshaka ikindi kintu.
Each one is just good.	Buri kimwe ni cyiza gusa.
He was a boy.	Yari umuhungu.
It was all me.	Byose byari njye.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's bad.	Ni mubi.
Who he was supposed to be.	Uwo yagombaga kuba.
This is good and good.	Ibi ni byiza kandi neza.
You didn't really know his family.	Ntabwo wari uzi umuryango we rwose.
I was close enough.	Nari mfite hafi bihagije.
It seems like a lot.	Asa naho ari byinshi.
And he is good too.	Kandi na we ni mwiza.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
All you can do is do what you can.	Ibyo ushobora gukora byose nibyo ushobora gukora.
I guess he's not a bad guy after all.	Ndakeka ko atari umusore mubi nyuma.
But he knew in that look that he had failed.	Ariko yari azi ko atari byo.
Lots of great tips.	Inama nyinshi nziza.
Quit the job.	Reka akazi.
The guy needs this.	Umusore akeneye ibi.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
I need	Nkeneye.
He did not know how.	Ntiyari azi uko.
I want to drink.	Ndashaka kunywa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
We are here now.	Ubu turi hano.
Nothing for me at home.	Nta kintu kuri njye murugo.
The boy, too, was embarrassed.	Umuhungu, na we yari afite isoni.
For me this is the case.	Kuri njye ibi nibyo.
I should do it.	Nkwiye kubikora.
You don’t even have to think about me.	Ntugomba no gutekereza kuri njye.
He feels smart.	Yumva afite ubwenge.
Just to be honest.	Gusa kuvuga ukuri.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko iki atari igitekerezo cyiza nyuma ya byose.
I have no faith.	Ntacyo nizera.
I think that's just a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ibyo ari amakosa gusa.
This one is not.	Uyu na we ntabwo.
Yes, they were right.	Nibyo, bari bafite ukuri.
He was useless.	Nta cyo yari amaze.
The woman started looking for a place to live.	Umugore yatangiye gushaka aho aba.
You have to be that way.	Ugomba kuba uburyo.
He said he would do the same.	Yavuze ko na we yari kubikora.
That's not the case with me.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri njye.
I'm talking to you.	Ndimo kuvugana nawe.
But not fear.	Ariko si ubwoba.
I can't stay in this house.	Sinshobora kuguma muri iyi nzu.
He looked at both.	Yarebye bombi.
I want to be friends	Ndashaka kuba inshuti.
There are many problems.	Hariho ibibazo byinshi.
It was just an opportunity for me.	Kuri njye byari amahirwe gusa.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
We have to do it very soon.	Tugomba kubikora vuba cyane.
Nothing is true, however.	Nta kintu na kimwe ari ukuri, ariko.
I don't know what you look like.	Sinzi uko usa.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu yari afite.
Not just us.	Ntabwo ari twe gusa.
No problem at all.	Nta kibazo na gito.
I really like good plans.	Nkunda rwose gahunda nziza.
I think it's good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza.
I never did.	Nta na rimwe nigeze nkora.
He needed to believe something.	Yari akeneye kwizera ikintu.
If not, you're backtracking.	Niba atari byo, urimo gusubira inyuma.
He would be alone.	Yari kuba wenyine.
You have to.	Ugomba.
If something goes wrong.	Niba hari ikintu kibi.
It wasn’t much, but it was something.	Ntabwo byari byinshi, ariko byari ikintu.
I don't know where he is now.	Ntazi aho ari ubu.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
I'm sorry about that.	Mbabajwe nibyo.
But everything he had.	Ariko ibyo yari afite byose.
I hope you know how to do it so far.	Nizere ko uzi kubikora kugeza ubu.
Really good thing to do.	Nukuri ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekereje cyane.
This is not very likely.	Ibi ntabwo bishoboka cyane.
I feel like a family.	Numva ari umuryango.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
It's something you have to do.	Ni ikintu ugomba gukora.
He was about to come.	Yari agiye kuza.
He has no problem.	Nta kibazo afite.
You are the only one.	Ni wowe wenyine.
Only once, and that was enough.	Rimwe gusa, kandi ibyo byari bihagije.
You need to learn to eat more when you are alone.	Ugomba kwiga kurya cyane iyo uri wenyine.
If the party.	Niba ibirori.
He started walking.	Yatangiye kugenda.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
You can't say enough good things about him.	Ntushobora kuvuga ibintu byiza bihagije kuri we.
Here is your money.	Hano hari amafaranga yawe.
That you were my friend, that's right.	Ko wari inshuti yanjye, nibyo.
She really feels it.	Yumva rwose.
What we need is a good person.	Icyo dukeneye ni umuntu mwiza.
Very good stuff.	Ibintu byiza cyane.
It had to be a car.	Yagombaga kuba imodoka.
This is good.	Ibi ni byiza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
I have to look away.	Ngomba kureba kure.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko nawe yashakaga kuvuga.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
You can't think.	Ntushobora gutekereza.
I have one more thing to say.	Mfite ikindi kintu kimwe cyo kuvuga.
They are both.	Bombi ni.
But this is not a problem for us.	Ariko iki ntabwo ari ikibazo kuri twe.
I'm sure this is the case.	Nzi neza ko ibi.
He said nothing.	Nta cyo yavuze.
He said he may have asked the question.	Yavuze, birashoboka ko yabajije ikibazo.
But now it is.	Ariko ubu ni byo.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
Not good, but close.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko hafi.
Far sight.	Kubona kure.
Glad you are here !.	Nishimiye ko uri hano!.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
I don't know what you are.	Ntabwo nzi icyo uri cyo.
It was a great dinner party !.	Byari ibirori byiza byo kurya!.
He would really be alone.	Yaba rwose ari wenyine.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
You have things.	Ufite ibintu.
It was not true at all.	Ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
He got it all.	Yabonye byose.
But he was no longer there.	Ariko ntiyari akiri aho.
He was not ready.	Ntiyari yiteguye.
But it would not be a good movie.	Ariko ntabwo yaba firime nziza.
And there I am.	Kandi hariho njye.
At one point, it was very easy.	Igihe kimwe, byari byoroshye cyane.
Here's a tip.	Hano hari inama.
No one has ever been.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira.
I am thirty years old.	Mfite imyaka mirongo itatu.
I understand why.	Ndumva impamvu.
He had nothing to love about her.	Nta kintu na kimwe yakundaga kuri we.
I know exactly where they are.	Nzi neza aho bari.
Party every night.	Ibirori buri joro.
I was nearby.	Nari hafi aho.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
It's too young.	Ndi muto.
I had time.	Nari mfite umwanya.
That's not good at all.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
Maybe a bad idea.	Birashoboka igitekerezo kibi.
Normally, it’s a good family.	Mu bisanzwe, ni umuryango mwiza.
We are people first and foremost.	Turi abantu mbere na mbere.
I know exactly what he is doing.	Nzi neza icyo akora.
One has to help someone.	Umuntu agomba gufasha umuntu.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
He heard something.	Yumvise ikintu.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikintu kinini.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko iki kibazo atari ikibazo rwose.
We are very low.	Turi hasi cyane.
It's too far.	Ari kure cyane.
It's always your fault.	Buri gihe ni amakosa yawe.
But you have to do something.	Ariko ugomba kugira icyo ukora.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
It will not be easy.	Ntabwo bizaba byoroshye.
But it is at home.	Ariko ni murugo.
Probably not here.	Birashoboka ko atari hano.
I had the same thing.	Nari mfite ikindi kintu kimwe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
I think you are beautiful.	Ntekereza ko uri mwiza.
But nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe.
I have to tell someone.	Ngomba kubwira umuntu.
I am not, now.	Ntabwo ndi, ubu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
For one of us.	Kuri umwe muri twe.
About to give up time.	Hafi yo kureka igihe.
We can't figure out why.	Ntidushobora kumenya impamvu.
It will be very difficult.	Bizaba bigoye cyane.
Good vision.	Kubona neza.
He was not expecting it.	Ntabwo yari yiteze.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
I had a way.	Nari mfite uburyo.
You may not know what to expect.	Ntushobora kumenya icyo ugomba gutegereza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
But that's exactly what he wanted.	Ariko icyo ni cyo yashakaga.
I think they were all.	Ntekereza ko bose bari.
He was not a bad person.	Ntiyari umuntu mubi.
However, there is a good reason.	Ariko, hariho impamvu nziza.
In fact there is.	Mubyukuri hariho.
For each of us the truth.	Kuri buri wese muri twe ukuri.
I did it alone.	Nakoze wenyine.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
You were alone.	Wari wenyine.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
I mean.	Ndashaka kuvuga.
It was my fault.	Byari amakosa yanjye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I mean, please.	Ndashaka kuvuga, nyamuneka.
It would not come.	Ntabwo byari kuza.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko ibyo atari byo.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
You can get along well with him.	Urashobora kugenda neza kuri we.
It's not always a bad thing.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari ikintu kibi.
That’s a long time, for me.	Icyo ni igihe kirekire, kuri njye.
You have to be on top.	Ugomba kuba hejuru.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
Neither do we.	Ntabwo natwe igihe.
You want it right.	Urashaka neza.
He was embarrassed.	Yagize isoni.
You are a beautiful girl	Uri umukobwa mwiza.
But for him.	Ariko kuri we.
He chose this alone.	Yahisemo ibi wenyine.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
Very close, in fact.	Hafi cyane, mubyukuri.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
You really have to.	Ugomba rwose.
But he was not ready.	Ariko ntabwo yari yiteguye.
It's really good.	Ni byiza rwose.
I can't explain why.	Sinshobora impamvu.
I don't want to say that again.	Sinshaka kongera kuvuga.
And there is a lot of food.	Kandi hariho ibiryo byinshi.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
You can stay on top, though.	Urashobora kuguma hejuru, naho.
It was close.	Byari hafi.
It would all be easy.	Byose byaba byoroshye.
It was my first house.	Nari inzu yanjye ya mbere.
I want to be with him.	Ndashaka kubana na we.
I think he is right.	Ndakeka ko afite ukuri.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, birasa cyane.
Walking was very difficult.	Kugenda byari bigoye cyane.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe yasaga na we.
He needed to know more.	Yari akeneye kumenya byinshi.
He didn't know what to think.	Ntiyari azi icyo atekereza.
It seems like a lot of it.	Birasa nkaho bishoboka byinshi kubikora.
We don't need that.	Ntabwo dukeneye ibyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ni ikibazo cyo kubikora.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
Maybe it's me.	Birashoboka ko ari njye.
And he was alone.	Kandi yari wenyine.
Anything bad.	Ikintu cyose kibi.
You should have been an actor.	Wari ukwiye kuba umukinnyi.
He agreed to go.	Yemeye kujyana.
He went.	Yagiye.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
To live.	Kubaho.
It's up to him.	Ari kuri we.
Sometimes he can win, and sometimes he can't.	Rimwe na rimwe arashobora gutsinda, kandi rimwe na rimwe ntashobora.
It is not my fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yanjye.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He thought about the problem.	Yatekereje ikibazo ku kibazo.
Driving is better than ever.	Gutwara imodoka ni byiza cyane kuruta uko byari bisanzwe.
I may not know.	Nshobora kuba ntazi.
And he's ready to do it again.	Kandi yiteguye kongera kubikora.
He did it very well.	Yabikoze neza cyane.
I'm in the phone room.	Ndi ku cyumba cya terefone.
You have a great gift.	Ufite impano nziza.
You have to get married.	Ugomba gushaka.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He said he would be there.	Yavuze ko azaba ahari.
In fact, it doesn't look good.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo asa nkaho ari mwiza.
He just watched.	Yarebye gusa.
The space is great.	Umwanya ni mwiza.
He says that's not the case.	Avuga ko atari byo.
That's not what you think.	Ntabwo aribyo utekereza.
At the time, I was well aware.	Icyo gihe nari nzi neza.
I need to have what you need.	Nkwiye kugira ibyo ukeneye.
You are my daughter.	Uri umukobwa wanjye.
Not at all, time.	Ntabwo aribyo, igihe.
I'm scared.	Mfite ubwoba.
Everyone who wants one has one.	Umuntu wese ushaka umwe afite umwe.
But the prison was.	Ariko gereza yari.
The only person who can truly believe is you.	Umuntu wenyine ushobora kwizera rwose niwowe wenyine.
We don't have to.	Ntabwo tugomba.
I didn't do much for a long time.	Ntabwo nakoze neza igihe kinini.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari birashoboka.
However, there is a catch.	Ariko, hariho gufata.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose ni byiza.
He is a swimmer.	Ni umukinnyi wo koga.
And I don't know why.	Kandi ntazi impamvu.
I guess not.	Ndakeka ko atari byo.
He loves fear.	Akunda ubwoba.
My daughter is a beautiful girl.	Umukobwa wanjye ni umukobwa mwiza.
I can't see that.	Sinshobora kubona ibyo.
I am the only one who has time for me.	Ninjye wenyine ufite umwanya kuri njye.
He looked bad.	Yarebye nabi.
Sometimes it worked out well but not always.	Rimwe na rimwe byagenze neza ariko ntabwo buri gihe.
Everyone is doing something good.	Buri wese akora ikintu cyiza.
And here they are.	Kandi hano bari.
To be afraid.	Kugira ubwoba.
Or better than me.	Cyangwa kundusha.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose ushobora kuba.
But they were all there.	Ariko bose bari aho.
That was exactly what he needed.	Ibyo aribyo yari akeneye.
He is walking and talking.	Arimo kugenda kandi avuga.
It was very good.	Nibyiza byari byiza cyane.
I know what he can do.	Nzi icyo ashobora gukora.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I want to help.	Ndashaka gufasha.
I'm glad to be here today.	Nishimiye kuba hano hano uyu munsi.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
They knew better.	Bari bazi neza.
It was not for me.	Ntabwo byari kuri njye.
You don't have this.	Ntabwo ufite ibi.
Nothing at all.	Nta kintu na kimwe rwose.
But that is not good.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
I had someone in me.	Nari mfite umuntu muri njye.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
I know we are.	Nzi ko turi.
I like to live and work in this world.	Nkunda kubaho no gukora muri iyi si.
Only he is not alone.	Gusa ntabwo ari wenyine.
It was too far.	Yari kure cyane.
I enjoyed that day.	Nishimiye uwo munsi.
This is your chance.	Ubu ni amahirwe yawe.
Not much to see.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo kubona.
Now I understand what he means.	Ubu ndumva icyo ashaka kuvuga.
It didn't happen that way.	Ntabwo byagenze gutya.
He needed to see.	Yari akeneye kubona.
You are not working alone.	Ntabwo urimo gukora wenyine.
Maybe he should go back to the house.	Ahari agomba gusubira mu nzu.
I wanted to do something else.	Nashakaga gukora ikindi kintu.
Tell me, he is.	Mbwira, ni we.
Or you can do something.	Cyangwa urashobora gukora ikintu.
This is the first.	Niki cya mbere.
You do things backwards.	Ukora ibintu inyuma.
And you can tell when someone is doing that.	Kandi urashobora kumenya igihe umuntu akora ibyo.
Something to look forward to.	Ikintu cyo gutegereza.
He may still be around.	Ashobora kuba akiri hafi.
Going well.	Kugenda neza.
I do nothing here.	Ntacyo nkora hano.
Today is worse than yesterday, but better than tomorrow.	Uyu munsi ni mubi kurenza ejo, ariko ni byiza kurenza ejo.
I'm sure everything will happen tomorrow.	Nzi neza ko ejo byose bizaba.
We are one people.	Turi abantu umwe.
He chose to go.	Yahisemo kujyana.
One thing, for sure.	Ikintu kimwe, mubyukuri.
They are worried.	Bafite impungenge.
He did not want to do this.	Ntiyashakaga gukora ibi.
He did it quickly.	Yakoze vuba.
I'm the same	Nanjye ndi nkanjye.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Not so fast.	Ntabwo ari uko byagenze vuba.
Apparently it was hard to walk.	Biragaragara ko byari bigoye kugenda.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
We need that down.	Dukeneye ibyo hasi.
He could tell exactly what they were going to do.	Yashoboraga kuvuga neza icyo bari gukora.
It's not really anything.	Ntabwo rwose ari ikintu na kimwe.
But you can help.	Ariko urashobora gufasha.
He has to work hard and play hard.	Agomba gukora cyane no gukina cyane.
I hope that's good with you.	Nizere ko ibyo ari byiza nawe.
He has a job.	Afite akazi.
We have everything we need.	Dufite ibyo dukeneye byose.
Maybe he'll be gone.	Ahari azaba yagiye.
He is smart.	Afite ubwenge.
You can tell what you mean.	Urashobora kumenya icyo ushaka kuvuga.
And what he said is not true.	Kandi ibyo yavuze ntabwo ari ukuri.
I think he would be three today.	Ntekereza ko uyu munsi yaba afite imyaka itatu.
And that is true.	Kandi ibyo ni ukuri.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
As if he were far away.	Nkaho yari kure.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
.	.
You too	Nawe?
Everything is great.	Byose ni byiza cyane.
One day it is possible.	Umunsi umwe birashoboka.
He wanted to go.	Yashakaga kugenda.
It was neither good nor bad.	Ntiyari mwiza cyangwa mubi.
I was also very close.	Nanjye nari hafi cyane.
I think so.	Ntekereza cyane.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
You can take anything.	Urashobora gufata ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
Not people like me.	Ntabwo abantu nkanjye.
You have clearly seen that so far.	Wabonye neza ko kugeza ubu.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
I think this is all.	Ntekereza ko ibi aribyo byose.
Nothing now.	Nta kintu na kimwe ubu.
If it weren’t for the bad, it would be great.	Niba atari mubi, byari kuba byiza.
If not here's a new product just for you!	Niba kandi atari byo, byari byiza, kandi.
You have time.	Ufite umwanya.
Here.	Hano.
You are not beautiful.	Ntabwo uri mwiza.
And it is very high.	Kandi ni hejuru cyane.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
He had no problem drinking.	Ntabwo yari afite ikibazo cyo kunywa.
I'm happy to help.	Nishimiye gufasha.
I hope he wanted to here.	Nizera ko yashakaga hano.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
I don't think so.	Ndumva atari byiza cyane.
They know where we are.	Bazi aho turi.
I feel happy and well at home.	Ndumva nishimiye kandi neza murugo.
Good friends, really.	Inshuti nziza, mubyukuri.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
He is not at home.	Ntabwo ari murugo.
He was young.	Yari muto.
Not fast enough.	Ntabwo ari vuba bihagije.
He was the first to speak.	Niwe wa mbere wavuze.
Maybe it's us.	Birashoboka ko ari twe.
He can do what he wants.	Ashobora gukora icyo ashaka.
I am not a party.	Ntabwo ndi ibirori.
How to work.	Uburyo bwo gukora.
Anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He is your friend.	Ni inshuti yawe.
I want to stay there.	Ndashaka kuguma aho.
He did nothing wrong.	Nta kibi yakoze.
He thought about it now.	Yatekereje kuri iki gihe.
That was a lot.	Ibyo byari byinshi.
Many problems arise.	Ibibazo byinshi biragaragara.
I was lucky.	Nagize amahirwe.
I saw that.	Nabonye ko.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
The first reason is this.	Impamvu ya mbere ni iyi.
It's just beautiful.	Ni mwiza gusa.
But things are not easy.	Ariko ibintu ntabwo byoroshye.
He is before me.	Ari imbere yanjye.
Apparently he is.	Biragaragara ko ari.
He wants to talk.	Arashaka kuvuga.
We all had children.	Twese twari dufite abana.
I don’t even know where he is, not really.	Ntazi n'aho ari, atari mubyukuri.
I never wanted a bad person.	Ntabwo nigeze nshaka umuntu mubi.
It was good for me.	Kuri njye byari byiza.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari ukuri.
I know he was.	Nzi ko yari.
That was children.	Ibyo byari abana.
It's something you've said before.	Ni ikintu wavuze mbere.
The car was going.	Imodoka yari kugenda.
He had nothing to do with it.	Icyo yagombaga gukora nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
I need a job.	Nkeneye akazi.
No hearing.	Nta kumva.
You just saw the same thing.	Wabonye gusa kimwe.
Why quit ?.	Kuki kureka?.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Gusa ugomba kubona neza cyane.
No one is here.	Nta muntu uri hano.
Just a plan and a plan.	Gusa gahunda na gahunda.
It's not a mistake we have to make.	Ntabwo ari amakosa tugomba gukora.
And you know why.	Kandi uzi impamvu.
I got a job.	Nabonye akazi.
We need to figure out how to do it right.	Tugomba gushaka uburyo bwo kubikora neza.
Just once, please.	Rimwe gusa, nyamuneka.
But we were on the positive side.	Ariko twari ku kintu cyiza.
From near him.	Kuva hafi ye.
He had nothing to say.	Ntabwo yagombaga kugira ikindi avuga.
That's great today.	Nibyiza cyane uyumunsi.
Or this time.	Cyangwa iki gihe.
He is stepping back.	Arimo gusubira inyuma.
I have to work.	Ngomba gukora.
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
He tried the door.	Yagerageje umuryango.
But what we had was true.	Ariko ibyo twari dufite byari ukuri.
We have a problem there.	Dufite ikibazo aho.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari wenyine.
That would be very difficult.	Ibyo byaba bigoye cyane.
I know it's possible.	Nzi ko bishoboka.
One came to where I was.	Umwe yaje aho ndi.
I have to look into that.	Ngomba kureba muri ibyo.
Someone who knows the truth.	Umuntu uzi ukuri.
Or who he was.	Cyangwa uwo yari we.
'	'
I like good food.	Nkunda ibiryo byiza.
I can read this, one day.	Nshobora gusoma ibi, umunsi umwe.
Or not at all.	Cyangwa sibyo rwose.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
I was good to him.	Nari mwiza kuri we.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He has, or has, always.	Afite, cyangwa afite, buri gihe.
I have a car.	Mfite imodoka.
And another time.	Kandi ikindi gihe.
I am today.	Ndi iki gihe.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
If that’s the case we need to go back.	Niba aribyo dukeneye gusubira inyuma.
I think that's enough right now.	Ntekereza ko bihagije kuri ubu.
Or you can.	Cyangwa urashobora.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You can help with that.	Urashobora gufasha hamwe nibyo.
I don't want to get married again.	Sinshaka kongera gushaka.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I think it was good for him.	Ntekereza ko byari byiza kuri we.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
You can't be here.	Ntushobora kuba hano.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
Only this.	Ibi gusa.
He could read everything.	Yashoboraga gusoma buri kintu.
I feel like an actor.	Numva ndi umukinnyi.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
A book? 	Igitabo?
.	.
It was really good.	Byari ibintu byiza rwose.
And in fact.	Kandi mubyukuri.
Just down, in fact.	Hasi gusa, mubyukuri.
It is not very difficult.	Ntabwo bigoye cyane.
Nothing today.	Uyu munsi nta kintu na kimwe.
It would not have been easy.	Ntabwo byari kuba byoroshye.
Everyone has a way of working.	Umuntu wese afite uburyo bwo gukora.
There are many possibilities.	Birashoboka ibintu byinshi.
I can't buy that.	Ntabwo nshobora kugura ibyo.
He really wanted to have a family.	Yashakaga rwose kugira umuryango.
You have to get married.	Ugomba gushaka.
It was not bad.	Ntiyari mubi.
Maybe you should do the same thing.	Birashoboka ko ugomba gukora ikintu kimwe.
But he had to try.	Ariko yagombaga kugerageza.
A lot of wanting to work in a very short time.	Byinshi byo gushaka gukora mugihe gito cyane.
I don’t see in all of that.	Ntabwo mbona muri ibyo byose.
And he would go.	Kandi yari kugenda.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He had not come.	Ntiyari yaje.
I shouldn't have come here.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuza hano.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
We must do the same.	Natwe tugomba kubikora.
And he could see exactly what he was looking for.	Kandi yashoboraga kubona neza ibyo yashakaga.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
I didn’t want him to be there.	Sinifuzaga ko aba ahari.
That's not good to eat.	Ibyo ntabwo ari byiza kurya.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It's not close enough.	Ntabwo ari hafi bihagije.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Great idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
He may be younger than he looks.	Ashobora kuba muto kurenza uko asa.
That he was not ready.	Ko atari yiteguye.
I thought it was time.	Natekereje ko ari igihe.
At present, we do not have.	Kuri ubu, ntabwo dufite.
He was probably going wrong.	Birashoboka ko yari arimo agenda nabi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
There is a good chance that everything will be fine.	Hari amahirwe menshi yuko ibintu byose bizaba byiza.
Only me, alone.	Gusa njye, wenyine.
I think that's his thing.	Ntekereza ko aricyo kintu cye.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
It is very small, easy.	Ni muto cyane, byoroshye.
No one knew where we were going.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho tugomba kujya.
He just has a back.	Afite gusa inyuma.
But that is not me.	Ariko uwo si njye.
You can't wait for that one.	Ntushobora gutegereza uwo.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Reading hard.	Gusoma cyane.
You're going to do it the way I want to.	Ugiye kubikora uko nshaka.
And that was it.	Kandi ibyo byari.
I didn’t want to know more.	Sinifuzaga kumenya byinshi.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
But this is not good.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
There is something wrong with him.	Hariho ikintu kibi kuri we.
It was not my fault, but it was the truth.	Ntabwo byari amakosa yanjye, ariko byari ukuri.
He later returned to work.	Nyuma yaje gusubira ku kazi.
He didn't need that.	Ntabwo yari akeneye ibyo.
I can't have the gift of knowing.	Ntabwo nshobora kugira impano yo kumenya neza.
I'm not happy.	Ntabwo nishimiye.
He didn't need to.	Ntiyari akeneye.
He had no problem.	Nta kibazo yari afite.
It was great, it was real.	Byari byiza cyane, byari ukuri.
The method is.	Uburyo ni.
I know them all.	Nzi bose.
We can't do anything wrong.	Ntabwo dushobora gukora ikintu kibi cyose.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
The weather is good.	Igihe ni cyiza.
But there is one thing.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe.
Nor would it exist.	Cyangwa ntiyari kubaho.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
That was really smart.	Ibyo byari ubwenge rwose.
You are doing it.	Urimo kubikora.
I can't go to work.	Sinshobora kujya ku kazi.
It seems.	Birasa naho.
Good and early.	Neza kandi kare.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I know he is not.	Nzi ko atari we.
You work hard.	Ukora cyane.
But it was really hard to be at home.	Ariko byari bigoye rwose kuba murugo.
It's not the same thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe.
You can't even know what you want.	Ntushobora no kumenya icyo ushaka.
I thought maybe.	Natekereje ko ahari.
It's a big deal here.	Ari ikintu kinini hano.
He probably didn't know anything.	Birashoboka ko ntacyo yari azi.
Any day	Umunsi uwo ari wo wose.
I'm not sure if that's the case or not.	Sinzi neza niba aricyo kibazo cyangwa atari cyo.
But they are afraid to be here.	Ariko bafite ubwoba bwo kuba hano.
But what.	Ariko iki.
I just don't know how.	Gusa sinzi uko.
Live food instead of live food.	Kurya kubaho aho kubaho kurya.
He knew it was there.	Yari azi ko ahari.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
Isn't it good ?.	Ntabwo ari byiza?.
Only this time everything went wrong.	Gusa iki gihe byose byari byagenze nabi.
You need to know that they are human.	Ugomba kumenya ko ari abantu.
Away, but it's possible.	Kure, ariko birashoboka.
He did not know what they were.	Ntiyari azi icyo bari cyo.
They know, now, what we have.	Bazi, ubu, ibyo dufite.
He had one as a child.	Yagize umwe akiri umwana.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
He is not human, or human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu, cyangwa abantu.
What we need now is.	Icyo dukeneye ubu ni.
In school now.	Mu ishuri ubu.
We don't have.	Ntabwo dufite.
I work fast.	Nkora vuba.
I need a question.	Nkeneye ikibazo.
You have to talk and tell people.	Ugomba kuvuga no kubwira abantu.
But later.	Nyuma ariko.
It would have been really easy.	Byari kuba byoroshye rwose.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
And that's probably the case.	Kandi birashoboka ko aribyo.
There is only food.	Hariho kurya gusa.
I love everything he did.	Nkunda ibyo yakoze byose.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I want to do it again.	Ndashaka kongera kubikora.
He can.	Arashobora.
Time to look back, to think.	Igihe cyo kureba inyuma, cyo gutekereza.
In a short time.	Mugihe gito.
But so far so good.	Ariko kugeza ubu ni byiza cyane.
He was a good, good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza, mwiza.
I never saw them all.	Sinigeze mbona bose.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
It was very difficult to know exactly where.	Byari bigoye cyane kumenya aho neza.
I don’t have to drink too much.	Ntabwo ngomba kunywa cyane.
I like to study.	Nkunda kwiga.
But there is no reason to do so.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo kubikora.
I can't have a problem.	Ntabwo nshobora kugira ikibazo.
He said he thought it would be better for me.	Yavuze ko yatekereje ko byari kuba byiza kuri njye.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko.
That's what he did.	Nibyo yakoze.
Wisdom is not true.	Ubwenge ntabwo ari ukuri.
It would be great! 	Byaba byiza rwose!
It is good to say that it is possible.	Nibyiza umuntu avuga ko bishoboka.
I'm worried.	Mfite impungenge.
Or maybe you were too.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko nawe wari urimo.
He has it all.	Afite ibyo byose.
If this is possible.	Niba ibi bishoboka.
Or close.	Cyangwa hafi.
And it was really good.	Kandi byari byiza rwose.
But I don’t want to tell you.	Ariko ntashaka kumbwira.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
There are more people than work.	Hariho abantu benshi kuruta akazi.
I don't know what to think.	Sinzi icyo ntekereza.
Like.	Nka.
You can buy it here.	Urashobora kugura hano.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
He did not want to do that.	Ntiyashakaga kubikora.
We had that.	Twari dufite ibyo.
People may not have it.	Abantu ashobora kuba adafite.
You can't take your money.	Ntushobora kujyana amafaranga yawe.
That's really possible.	Ibyo rwose birashoboka.
We can know nothing.	Ntacyo dushobora kumenya.
You can only have a day.	Urashobora kugira umunsi gusa.
He needed to be alone here.	Yari akeneye kuba wenyine hano.
That's all good.	Ibyo byose ni byiza.
He was not out.	Ntiyari hanze.
You don't know what to do.	Ntabwo uzi icyo ukora.
This is a great movie.	Iyi ni firime nziza.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
Maybe you should read it again.	Ahari ugomba kongera gusoma.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Not the same.	Ntabwo ari kimwe.
That would be normal.	Byaba ari ibintu bisanzwe.
Things would not be better.	Ntabwo ibintu byari kuba byiza.
Certainly, he could have done it.	Rwose, yashoboraga kubikora.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
He went yesterday.	Yagiye ejo.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
I feel good about it.	Numva nishimiye kubikora.
He is confident that he has done so.	Yizeye neza ko yabikoze.
He never felt alone.	Ntabwo yigeze yumva ko ari wenyine.
Probably a lot.	Birashoboka ko ari byinshi.
I ask for time to do all this.	Ndabaza igihe cyo gukora ibi byose.
He knew nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari azi.
If not, I don't know what to do.	Niba atari byo, sinzi icyo gukora.
The hair was on top.	Umusatsi wari hejuru.
He thought hard.	Yatekereje cyane.
Wisdom.	Ubwenge.
To him.	Kugeza kuri we.
That's great !!!.	Nibyiza cyane !!!.
He knew he had to say something.	Yari azi ko agomba kugira icyo avuga.
I'm sorry another time.	Mbabajwe ikindi gihe.
I've been here since the beginning.	Nari hano kuva mbere.
We have to.	Tugomba.
He was very good at that.	Yari mwiza cyane muri ibyo.
He came, but he did not know what to do.	Yaje, ariko ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
I can do this.	Nshobora gukora ibi.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
I don't deserve it.	Ntabwo nkwiye.
I can't take it.	Sinshobora gufata.
There are people.	Hariho abantu.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I knew the truth.	Nari nzi ukuri.
But the truth is.	Ariko ukuri ni ukuri.
That's a good idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cyiza.
Age study.	Kwiga imyaka.
But he had a plan.	Ariko yari afite gahunda.
He was a friend.	Yari inshuti.
He had to try hard.	Yagombaga kugerageza cyane.
There are problems later.	Hariho ibibazo nyuma.
I think it was very soon.	Ndakeka ko byari vuba cyane.
I don't know what happened to this.	Sinzi uko byagenze kuri ibi.
He says he wants to go.	Avuga ko yifuza kugenda.
He was not there.	Ntabwo yari ahari.
This was recently.	Ibi byari vuba aha.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ibintu byagenze neza.
The child was a boy.	Umwana yari umuhungu.
He took a job.	Yafashe akazi.
Not if you know what to do.	Ntabwo niba uzi icyo ukora.
That's right, and that's all.	Nibyo, kandi nibyo byose.
I thought it would be enough.	Natekereje ko bizaba bihagije.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
As you can see for sure.	Nkuko ushobora kumenya neza ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
Now is the time !.	Ubu ni igihe!.
That he will be there.	Ko azaba ahari.
One day, he left.	Umunsi umwe, yagiye.
He handled it well.	Yafashe neza.
That's right now.	Nibyo kuri ubu.
There is her son.	Hariho umuhungu we.
In fact in fact.	Mubyukuri mubyukuri.
Everything was really good.	Ibintu byose byari byiza rwose.
If you are far enough away.	Niba uri kure bihagije.
You would have given up.	Wari kureka.
He was not.	Ntabwo yari uwo.
All they had was people.	Ibyo bari bafite byose byari abantu.
He can do it.	Arashobora kubikora.
It was good enough.	Byari byiza bihagije.
It wouldn't be here.	Ntabwo byari kuba hano.
We're all here.	Twese hano hano.
Much easier, that would be.	Byinshi byoroshye, ibyo byaba.
You want to look good.	Ushaka kureba neza.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
This was a movie.	Iyi yari firime.
I don't like it.	Ntabwo nkunda.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe.
You can live well.	Urashobora kubaho neza.
.	.
But he did not want to do that.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kubikora.
It would all be fun.	Byose byari gukina cyane.
He was as scared as both.	Yari afite ubwoba nka bombi.
You are not sure of this.	Ntabwo uzi neza ibi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza.
She was now his wife.	Ubu yari umugore we.
If so, you should do it.	Niba aribyo, ugomba kubikora.
He knows exactly what to do.	Azi neza icyo gukora.
I am very happy with this.	Nishimiye cyane ibi.
For one thing.	Ku kintu kimwe.
He found his friend.	Yabonye inshuti ye.
No more than three years.	Ntashobora kurenza imyaka itatu.
And in fact.	Kandi mubyukuri.
I wonder if they have time to think every day.	Ndabaza niba bafite umwanya wo gutekereza buri munsi.
It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
I want to be.	Ndashaka kuba.
And not just us.	Kandi si twe gusa.
I hope you like it.	Nizere ko ukunda.
But for me, no problem.	Ariko kuri njye, nta kibazo.
But we are a little ahead.	Ariko turi imbere gato.
Swim before eating.	Koga mbere yo kurya.
He just said he couldn't do it.	Gusa yavuze ko adashobora kubikora.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
I found something else to do.	Nabonye ikindi kintu cyo gukora.
Why? 	Kuki?
He must know how to read.	Agomba kumenya gusoma.
We were dogs.	Twari imbwa.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
I didn't want to come soon.	Sinifuzaga kuza vuba.
And you can do that.	Kandi urashobora kubikora.
I enjoy the job.	Nishimiye akazi.
I did, but I didn't.	Nakoze, ariko sibyo.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
But let it be.	Ariko reka.
I love everyone.	Nkunda abantu bose.
I was well aware.	Nari nzi neza.
He is not very young in front of him.	Ntabwo ari umusore cyane imbere ye.
You're going to tell me why.	Ugiye kumbwira impamvu.
That's good for me.	Nibyiza kuri njye.
They have a lot easier now.	Bafite byinshi byoroshye ubu.
But no problem.	Ariko nta kibazo.
But that's really good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza rwose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
We were not.	Ntabwo twari.
He didn't really mean it at the moment.	Ntabwo rwose yashakaga kuvuga kuri ubu.
Probably none of that is true.	Birashoboka ko nta na kimwe muri byo ari ukuri.
I was sure that.	Nari nzi neza ko.
You have a job.	Ufite akazi.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I enjoy what I enjoy and you can too.	Nishimiye ibyo nishimiye kandi nawe urashobora.
Sometimes one day.	Rimwe na rimwe umunsi umwe.
And he had a lot of good advice.	Kandi yari afite inama nyinshi nziza.
This is good for us.	Ibi ni byiza kuri twe.
Nothing so far.	Nta kintu na kimwe kugeza ubu.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
Everyone wants to be young again.	Umuntu wese arashaka kongera kuba muto.
It is a beautiful house.	Ni inzu nziza.
He seemed to need help.	Yasaga naho akeneye ubufasha.
I guess so.	Ndakeka ko aribyo.
I had problems.	Nagize ibibazo.
Easy and good.	Byoroshye kandi byiza.
If anyone was inside, they would listen.	Niba hari umuntu wari imbere, bari kumva.
We were not close.	Ntabwo twari hafi.
You are a good young man.	Uri umusore mwiza.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
And bad.	Kandi mubi.
There is no time to stop.	Nta gihe cyo guhagarika.
That's not the case.	Ntabwo ari ibyo.
I have my own plan.	Mfite gahunda yanjye.
He was an expert.	Yari umuhanga.
It is not harder than that.	Ntabwo bigoye kuruta ibyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I was lucky at the time.	Nagize amahirwe icyo gihe.
Easy, easy.	Byoroshye, byoroshye.
I'm going to go back if possible.	Ngiye gusubira inyuma niba bishoboka.
I finally know why.	Amaherezo nzi impamvu.
You can't either.	Ntushobora kandi.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
I have.	Mfite .
Or not alone.	Cyangwa ntabwo ari wenyine.
I really should go.	Nkwiye rwose kugenda.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, byari ukuri.
All is well, all is well.	Byose ni byiza, byose ni byiza.
I hope so.	Ndizera ko aribyo.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
But we need it.	Ariko dukeneye.
What are you going to do now.	Ugiye gukora iki ubu.
She is a very beautiful, normal, beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza cyane, bisanzwe, byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, iyi ni amakosa.
Obviously, tell me.	Biragaragara, kumbwira.
Out and about.	Hanze na kure.
He said well, well.	Yavuze neza, neza.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Igihe cyo kongera gukora.
It hasn't been long.	Ntabwo yamaze igihe kinini.
You can walk down.	Urashobora kugenda hasi.
I didn’t think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga cyane.
We didn’t have much to go with.	Ntabwo twari dufite byinshi byo kujyana.
Nothing to see here.	Nta kintu cyo kubona hano.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
It didn't look right.	Ntabwo yasaga neza.
He can't figure out what he wants.	Ntashobora kumenya icyo ashaka.
Not good for him.	Ntabwo ari mwiza kuri we.
Lots of questions.	Ibibazo byinshi.
That's not really the case here.	Ibyo rwose ntabwo aribyo hano.
You have to learn how to be alone.	Ugomba kwiga uburyo bwo kuba wenyine.
I don't have to live.	Ntabwo nkwiye kubaho.
That is not the case, and we need to know why.	Ntabwo aribyo, kandi dukeneye kumenya impamvu.
I really am.	Nanjye rwose nanjye.
But here.	Ariko hano.
He said it was not good.	Yavuze ko atari byiza.
He knows the truth.	Azi ukuri icyo aricyo.
I think it's good.	Ndakeka ko ari byiza.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
And he was beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
But you must not be afraid.	Ariko ntugomba kugira ubwoba.
He doesn't have to talk to me.	Ntagomba kuvugana nanjye.
You want to win.	Urashaka gutsinda.
He worked for three years.	Yakoze imyaka itatu.
He just wants to win.	Arashaka gutsinda gusa.
None of this is true.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari ukuri.
Here are the things with him.	Hano hari ibintu hamwe na we.
And that's right.	Kandi ni ukuri.
I want to do something about that.	Ndashaka kugira icyo nkora kuri ibyo.
But that sounds bad.	Ariko ibyo birasa nabi.
He finally decided to leave.	Amaherezo yahisemo kugenda.
All he needed was a job.	Icyo yari akeneye ni akazi.
In fact, it was recently.	Mubyukuri, byari vuba aha.
He was looking for a dog.	Yashakaga imbwa.
I had a lot to say.	Nari mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
Things you might want to think about.	Ibintu ushobora gushaka gutekereza.
I understand why you want to do this.	Ndumva impamvu ushaka gukora ibi.
He was not human.	Ntiyari umuntu.
I have never seen such a beautiful person.	Sinigeze mbona umuntu mwiza cyane.
He wanted to learn more.	Yashakaga kwiga byinshi.
We have a lot.	Dufite byinshi.
I know we can do that now.	Nzi ko dushobora kubikora ubu.
He did not know who he was.	Ntiyari azi uwo ari we.
But we have to act fast.	Ariko tugomba gukora vuba.
In the end.	Amaherezo.
It could have been.	Yashoboraga kuba.
But that is not all.	Ariko sibyo rwose.
Only when, together, can I know for sure.	Igihe gusa, ninde hamwe, ntashobora kumenya neza.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
One feels it is better to be at home.	Umuntu yumva ari byiza kuba murugo.
But he would do it.	Ariko yari kubikora.
He seemed to be away from her.	Yasaga naho ari kure ye.
And that is not good.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari byiza.
It was time to pick up the phone.	Yari mugihe cyo gufata terefone.
But he did not want to do that.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kubikora.
Or he just had.	Cyangwa yari afite gusa.
But there is more to it.	Ariko hariho byinshi kuri byo.
That's not the whole point.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo rwose.
He is probably the only one.	Birashoboka ko ari we wenyine.
But he had not come alone.	Ariko ntabwo yari yaje wenyine.
Eventually, it was inside him.	Amaherezo, yari imbere muri we.
I love it so much.	Nkunda cyane.
The girl had gone.	Umukobwa yari yagiye.
I have to go too.	Nanjye ngomba kugenda.
I had something to do.	Nari mfite icyo gukora.
Quit.	Kureka.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
At the time, he was lucky.	Icyo gihe yari afite amahirwe.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba gukora neza.
You can't stop this.	Ntushobora guhagarika ibi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I love what you do.	Nkunda ibyo ukora.
She is glad she has.	Yishimiye ko afite.
Either way he was ready to go.	Ibyo ari byo byose yari yiteguye kugenda.
In any case, it was not true.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo byari ukuri.
It was great for the movie.	Yari mwiza kuri firime.
Cuba.	Kuba.
Good family.	Umuryango mwiza.
You are really a good person.	Mubyukuri uri umuntu mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
And sometimes, that's right.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe, ni ukuri.
But he never did.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze abikora.
I have what I need.	Mfite ibyo nkeneye.
He is the only one who has money.	Niwe wenyine ufite amafaranga.
We are not now.	Ntabwo turi ubu.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
She loved being with us.	Yakundaga kubana natwe.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
You have to buy a book.	Ugomba kugura igitabo.
He has a good plan.	Afite gahunda nziza.
I knew who.	Nari nzi uwo.
But there is more to it.	Ariko hariho byinshi bishoboka.
It's clear.	Biragaragara neza.
And in fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Kandi mubyukuri, birasa cyane.
I want him to go.	Ndashaka ko agenda.
The party went well.	Ibirori byagenze neza.
I want to know what he knows.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo azi.
But not for long.	Ariko ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
He thought that now or never.	Yatekereje ko ubu cyangwa nta na rimwe.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ikibazo gusa.
But he was very confident.	Ariko yari yizeye cyane.
And that was true.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri.
This was very difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye cyane.
You are very scared.	Ufite ubwoba cyane.
You and I.	Wowe na njye.
He could see nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
There was no reason to do that now.	Nta mpamvu yari kubikora ubu.
There is someone here for everyone.	Hano hari umuntu kuri buri wese.
There are many cars.	Hariho imodoka nyinshi.
At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
I'm not sure though.	Ntabwo nzi neza ariko.
Your age.	Imyaka yawe.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
He just said it was good.	Yavuze gusa ko ari byiza.
At the same time, at any time, there is no time.	Igihe kimwe, igihe icyo ari cyo cyose, nta gihe.
He has nothing to say.	Ntacyo ashaka kuvuga.
Every woman in the movie was beautiful.	Umugore wese uri muri firime yari mwiza.
I was young and beautiful.	Nari muto kandi mwiza.
I'm sure this is the case today.	Nzi neza ko iki gihe ari ukuri.
Good on the inside.	Neza neza imbere.
Win, and you are.	Gutsinda, kandi urimo.
But he is not.	Ariko we sibyo.
He was not around.	Ntiyari hafi.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
Like all of us.	Nkuko twese.
I had no place to live.	Sinari mfite aho kuba.
I knew it would happen.	Nari nzi ko bizaba.
Many probably have it now.	Benshi birashoboka ko bafite ubu.
He was not just my friend.	Ntiyari inshuti yanjye gusa.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
She also has a child.	Afite kandi umwana.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
He means that there is nothing better here.	Arashaka kuvuga ko nta cyiza uri hano.
And he could see why.	Kandi yashoboraga kubona impamvu.
It's been a long time coming.	Hafi igihe kirekire.
Please no problem.	Nyamuneka nta kibazo.
It's just money after all.	Ni amafaranga gusa nyuma ya byose.
I have to stay here.	Ngomba kuguma hano.
Going together.	Kujya hamwe.
That's not what we need.	Ntabwo aribyo dukeneye.
And you are not bad.	Kandi ntabwo uri mubi.
He wanted something better.	Yashakaga ikintu cyiza.
He says things.	Avuga ibintu.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
This is not true, of course.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo, rwose.
Or he thinks he did.	Cyangwa yibwira ko yabikoze.
Or a problem, or what do you have.	Cyangwa ikibazo, cyangwa ufite iki.
Everyone looks good.	Umuntu wese asa neza.
It is not you, you are not here, it is not now.	Ntabwo ari wowe, ntabwo uri hano, ntabwo ari ubu.
However, it is true.	Ariko, ni ukuri.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
They both have no plans.	Bombi ntabwo bafite gahunda.
But let’s face it.	Ariko reka icyo kibazo.
You are not sure of the problem.	Ntabwo uzi neza ikibazo.
I may be short-lived.	Nshobora kuba igihe gito.
This is also true of me.	Ibi kandi ni ukuri kuri njye.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
The child needs time.	Umwana akeneye igihe.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi cyane.
You really have to be good.	Ugomba rwose kuba mwiza.
He was well aware that this was not the case.	Yari azi neza ko ibyo atari byiza.
I know my daughter.	Nzi umukobwa wanjye.
Of these it is very possible.	Muri ibi birashoboka cyane.
Little boy	Umuhungu muto.
Where a friend or family member agrees to do so.	Aho inshuti cyangwa umuryango wawe yemeye kubikora.
I'm scared too.	Nanjye mfite ubwoba.
That's not an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
He began to hear things.	Yatangiye kumva ibintu.
It was too far.	Yari kure cyane.
Maybe you too.	Birashoboka ko nawe.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
It was easy to want to live above all else.	Byari byoroshye gushaka kubaho hejuru ya byose.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo byose bigoye.
Find out where you are.	Kumenya aho uri.
He knew what to say.	Yari azi icyo yari kuvuga.
That's all you can do.	Nibyo byose ushobora gukora.
But he has the money.	Ariko afite amafaranga.
He thought it would be nice to have a closer look.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza kureba neza.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
You have to eat a lot.	Ugomba kurya byinshi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, iyo yari gahunda.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Sometimes, that is possible.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibyo birashoboka.
Knowing is good.	Kumenya ni byiza.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
I'm happy to help.	Nishimiye gufasha.
I should have been on that bus.	Nari nkwiye kuba muri iyo bisi.
She had a child.	Yari afite umwana.
But there is something else.	Ariko hari ikindi kintu.
This is especially true if you need money.	Ibi ni ukuri cyane cyane niba ukeneye amafaranga.
He tried to stay on the bus.	Yagerageje kuguma muri bisi.
Much is true.	Byinshi ni ukuri.
He walked away.	Yagiye kure agenda.
But we have nothing.	Ariko ntacyo dufite.
He thought to himself.	Yatekerezaga wenyine.
I hope almost everything is said.	Nizera ko hafi yo kuvuga byose.
.	.
I wanted to talk.	Nashakaga kuvugana.
He was not ready.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye.
There is so much to do here, especially living together.	Hano hari byinshi byo gukora hano, cyane cyane kubana.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
He thought he was about to leave.	Yatekereje ko hafi yo kugenda.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It would not go well.	Ntabwo byari kugenda neza.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
We were children.	Twari abana.
That's all.	Nibyo gusa.
He didn’t just want to watch.	Ntiyashakaga kureba gusa.
However, this is not always the case.	Ariko, mubyukuri ntabwo buri gihe ari byo.
I'm not really anything.	Ntabwo rwose ndi ikintu.
He is a good player.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza.
Not much to see.	Nta byinshi byo kubona.
One day to work.	Buri munsi umwe wo gukora.
They were all there.	Bose bari.
He didn't need much money.	Ntabwo yari akeneye amafaranga menshi.
He got it all.	Yabonye byose.
I was smart.	Nagize ubwenge.
I had no idea.	Sinari natekereje.
I'm glad you did well.	Nishimiye kubona ukora neza.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
Who knows someone.	Ninde uzi umuntu.
He speaks well.	Avuga neza.
He didn't say anything to me.	Nta cyo yambwiye.
He is not a bad person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mubi.
But this.	Ariko ibi.
He would not eat.	Ntabwo yari kurya.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
I can do nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora.
Anyone can see.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubona.
He thinks he is young, but he is not.	Yibwira ko akiri muto, ariko sibyo.
He seemed to know everyone.	Yasaga naho azi abantu bose.
He was a good boy.	Ari yari umwana mwiza.
The girl is very young.	Umukobwa ni muto cyane.
No time.	Nta gihe.
That was possible.	Ibyo byari bishoboka.
It wasn’t too bad.	Ntiyari mubi cyane.
But there is a possibility.	Ariko birashoboka ko hariho.
Up.	Hejuru.
I can't even think.	Ntashobora no gutekereza.
I just want to take a little time.	Gusa ndashaka gufata umwanya muto.
But they are children.	Ariko ni abana.
He didn't know anything else.	Ntiyari azi ikindi.
He was a bad person.	Yari umuntu mubi.
He thought it was easy.	Yatekereje ko byoroshye.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
Too bad.	Gukora nabi cyane.
He had no one.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari afite.
I have to say far.	Nkwiye kuvuga kure.
You can find an idea here.	Urashobora kubona igitekerezo hano.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
That's what happened.	Ni ko byagenze.
I have it here.	Mfite hano.
I want to hear why.	Ndashaka kumva impamvu.
All together	Byose hamwe.
Alone.	Wenyine.
He was inside.	Yari imbere.
Maybe he can help.	Ahari arashobora gufasha.
I am very ashamed.	Mfite isoni cyane.
He tried hard.	Yagerageje cyane.
Sometimes things were very difficult.	Rimwe na rimwe ibintu byari bigoye cyane.
Playing fees.	Amafaranga yo gukina.
I got my gift yesterday.	Nabonye impano yanjye ejo.
But with that.	Ariko hamwe nibyo.
He had nothing to say.	Ntiyari afite icyo avuga.
We can't wait.	Ntidushobora gutegereza.
And that was good.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza.
I know nothing.	Ntacyo nzi.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
Maybe you're on something here.	Birashoboka ko uri ku kintu hano.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
You have a lot of talent.	Ufite impano nyinshi.
Only once, but it was enough.	Rimwe gusa, ariko byari bihagije.
You have nothing to say.	Ntacyo ufite cyo kuvuga.
Not good enough for him.	Ntabwo ari byiza bihagije kuri we.
We also have a way of doing things right.	Dufite kandi uburyo bwo gukora neza.
I never thought it would be easy.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko byoroshye.
It was not me.	Ntabwo yari njye.
He can do it.	Arashobora kubikora.
He knew what he was trying to do.	Yari azi icyo yashakaga gukora.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
He can do better than me.	Arashobora gukora kundusha.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
'he said.	' yavuze.
But all we have today.	Ariko ibyo dufite byose muri iki gihe.
I also ask who he had here later.	Ndabaza kandi uwo yari afite hano nyuma.
He may be here.	Ashobora kuba ari hano.
My wife is also an expert.	Umugore wanjye nawe ni umuhanga.
He seemed worried.	Yasaga naho afite impungenge.
Not since then.	Ntabwo kuva icyo gihe.
He told me to look for something else.	Yambwiye gushaka ikindi kintu.
He was young.	Yari akiri muto.
And really good.	Kandi nziza cyane rwose.
I always think.	Ntekereza buri gihe.
I don’t want him to go.	Ntashaka ko agenda.
I just didn't know that.	Gusa sinari nzi uko.
But there is something else.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu.
Getting outside money.	Kubona amafaranga yo hanze.
I wanted to hear something good.	Nashakaga kumva ikintu cyiza.
Just one, though.	Umwe gusa, naho.
He had come here.	Hano yari yaje.
If you are at home, you can eat.	Niba uri murugo, urashobora kurya.
Probably a big issue.	Birashoboka ikibazo kinini.
Little did I know then.	Sinari nzi ko icyo gihe.
He has no problem.	Nta kibazo afite.
I can drive later.	Nshobora gutwara nyuma.
Niki ?.	Niki?.
I don’t want to get out of here obviously.	Sinshaka kuva hano biragaragara.
But one child can.	Ariko umwana umwe arashobora.
I know you did.	Nzi ko wabikoze.
She has children.	Afite abana.
He felt nothing.	Nta kintu yari yumva.
That's not the way it is.	Ntabwo ari uburyo.
I have a wife.	Mfite umugore wanjye.
Tell a lot of people this.	Bwira abantu benshi ibi.
Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
You can do it at any time.	Urashobora kubikora igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
He is working alone.	Arimo gukora wenyine.
Everyone knew something.	Abantu bose bari bazi ikintu.
You didn't need help.	Ntabwo wari ukeneye ubufasha.
That's right.	Nibyo.
I know for sure.	Nzi neza rwose.
To hear him speak clearly and clearly.	Kumva uko yavuze neza kandi neza.
If not good.	Niba atari byiza.
They have good food.	Bafite ibiryo byiza.
He knows what to do.	Azi icyo agomba gukora.
My beautiful son.	Umuhungu wanjye mwiza.
I don't know anyone in prison.	Nta muntu n'umwe nzi muri gereza.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I thought it would be nice.	Natekereje ko byaba byiza.
In the long run.	Mugihe kirekire rwose.
The problem is another.	Ikibazo ni ikindi.
He said he thought he was in the room.	Yavuze ko yatekereje ko ari mu cyumba.
He’s a good player, too.	Ni umukinnyi mwiza, kandi.
Something to go with.	Ikintu cyo kujyana.
Obviously, this is a very bad idea.	Biragaragara, iki ni igitekerezo kibi cyane.
You can do it now.	Urashobora kubikora nonaha.
From the ground up.	Kuva hasi.
That too is a good thing.	Icyo na cyo ni ikintu cyiza.
He doesn't know much.	Ntabwo azi neza.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
You have great things to do.	Ufite ibintu byiza cyane gukora.
I just feel.	Ndumva gusa.
It was here.	Byari hano.
It was a gift.	Byari impano.
I would just try.	Nari kugerageza gusa.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Birasa nkaho mubyukuri.
Like this !.	Nka iyi!.
For everyone.	Kuri buri wese.
That's all I know.	Ibyo aribyo byose nzi.
I think this time is good.	Ntekereza ko iki gihe ari cyiza.
But that is what happened.	Ariko ni ko byagenze.
But he can't go back.	Ariko ntashobora gusubira inyuma.
Most of it.	Byinshi muri byo.
He is one of many.	Ni umwe mu benshi.
None of this he did.	Nta na kimwe muri byo yakoze.
He can play.	Arashobora gukina.
We have to take time.	Tugomba gufata umwanya.
It was not an easy task.	Ntabwo byari ibintu byoroshye.
But there is one problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kimwe.
But not you.	Ariko ntabwo ari wowe.
I have to do it.	Ngomba kubikora.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He went upstairs.	Yagiye hejuru.
We need to know why.	Tugomba kumenya impamvu.
But he heard a lot.	Ariko yumvise byinshi.
He did both.	Yakoze bombi.
He never had this problem.	Ntabwo yigeze agira iki kibazo.
It was good, very good.	Byari byiza, byiza cyane.
If you have to study,.	Niba ugomba kwiga,.
You did it after all.	Wabikoze nyuma ya byose.
Eat.	Kurya.
I didn't hear anything.	Nta na kimwe numvise.
This is probably a mistake.	Ibi birashoboka ko ari amakosa.
.	.
They have his money.	Bafite amafaranga ye.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
That's not all.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo byose.
With that said, you’re going to do it.	Hamwe nibyo, ugiye kubikora.
But in reality it is better to be alone.	Ariko mubyukuri nibyiza kuruta kuba umuntu wenyine.
We need something else.	Dukeneye ikindi kintu.
People know the truth.	Abantu bazi ukuri.
He was actually a young man.	Mubyukuri yari muto we muto.
Drink only one.	Kunywa kimwe gusa.
He had a dog.	Yari afite imbwa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He did not need to be alone.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kuba wenyine.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
The problem is.	Ikibazo ni.
He knew exactly what he meant.	Yari azi neza icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
That is not the case in the long run.	Ntabwo aribyo mugihe kirekire.
We have to be.	Tugomba kuba.
Everything was behind him.	Byose byari inyuma ye.
I was really embarrassed.	Nagize isoni rwose.
You are just a human being.	Uri umuntu gusa.
He didn't know what it was, but there was something.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo, ariko hari ikintu.
It's a process.	Ni uburyo.
This was difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye.
Who do you mean?	Ninde ushaka kuvuga?.
He had been wearing his clothes for a long time.	Yari amaze igihe kinini yambaye imyenda ye.
From now on it was difficult.	Kuva aha byari bigoye.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
All, or almost all.	Byose, cyangwa hafi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And it was you.	Kandi wari wowe.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
It would be nice to have a dog.	Byaba byiza imbwa.
Looks like he always wants to eat.	Asa nkaho ahora ashaka kurya.
Everyone wanted to hear the truth about him.	Umuntu wese yashakaga kumva ukuri kuri we.
But there was one more thing he needed to do.	Ariko hariho ikindi kintu kimwe yari akeneye gukora.
This is the top of the list.	Ubu ni bwo hejuru bwo hejuru.
Everyone wants to win.	Umuntu wese arashaka gutsinda.
Bottom line.	Hasi hasi.
He didn't have much to do.	Ntabwo yari afite byinshi byo gukora.
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
I'm here to study.	Ndi hano kwiga.
I mean now.	Ndashaka kuvuga nonaha.
But this is not true.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
He was very human.	Yari umuntu cyane.
Over the years.	Kurenza imyaka.
Maybe he should take more.	Birashoboka ko agomba gufata byinshi.
He knew it was true.	Yari azi ko ari ukuri.
That was close.	Ibyo byari hafi.
It was about to work.	Byari hafi gukora.
I haven't seen much.	Sinigeze mbona byinshi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
But one day it was too much.	Ariko umunsi umwe byari byinshi cyane.
That was enough for him.	Ibyo byari bihagije kuri we.
It was normal.	Byari bisanzwe.
He can stay or come.	Arashobora kuguma cyangwa kuza.
And no morning.	Kandi nta gitondo na kimwe.
We need things.	Dukeneye ibintu.
It was his fault.	Byari amakosa ye.
And begging and begging.	Kandi gusaba no gusaba.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
In the long run, we have to do it.	Mugihe kirekire, tugomba kubikora.
He didn't have to do it.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubikora.
They are many.	Ni benshi.
Only this time.	Iki gihe gusa.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
He saw that he was not in her.	Yabonye ko atari muri we.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
They were a working family.	Bari umuryango ukora.
Well, very good.	Nibyiza, byiza cyane.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Today is another problem.	Uyu munsi ni ikindi kibazo.
I'm not far away now.	Ubu ntabwo ndi kure.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
It was very scary.	Byari ubwoba cyane.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I think that would be great.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bizaba byiza.
It was good and that's it.	Byari byiza kandi nibyo.
I think it would be nice.	Ndakeka ko byaba byiza.
I want to talk to you now.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe ubu.
I may have.	Nshobora kuba mfite.
He later found out that it was.	Nyuma yaje kumenya ko aribyo.
She thought she was beautiful.	Yatekereje ko yari mwiza.
As easy as it is.	Nkuko byoroshye.
I do not believe.	Ntabwo nizera.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Leave the child alone.	Reka umwana wenyine.
All in all, the car was gone.	Byose, imodoka yari yagiye.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
And he is not alone.	Kandi si we wenyine.
You can try it there.	Urashobora kugerageza aho.
He did a lot of that.	Yakoze byinshi muri byo.
He was not sitting well.	Ntabwo yari yicaye neza.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira.
Niki.	Niki.
But that is probably the case.	Ariko birashoboka ko aribyo.
I have to be close.	Ngomba kuba hafi.
He has something to do.	Afite icyo akora.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
This is not always the case.	Ubu ntabwo buri gihe ari ikibazo.
You are my intelligent daughter.	Uri umukobwa wanjye uzi ubwenge.
I think we can do that.	Ntekereza ko dushobora kubikora.
Maybe he is.	Birashoboka ko ari we.
However, he had to leave.	Ariko, yagombaga kugenda.
One day, maybe.	Umunsi umwe, birashoboka.
The problem we all have is that.	Ikibazo twese dufite ni uko.
And it's good.	Kandi ni mwiza.
It was hard to say.	Byari bigoye kuvuga.
Right now.	Kuri ubu.
But you have to think about what you do.	Ariko ugomba gutekereza kubyo ukora.
It was not for him.	Ntabwo yari kuri we.
Beautiful girl, beautiful.	Umukobwa mwiza, mwiza.
You can too.	Urashobora nawe.
He is currently working on a book.	Kuri ubu arimo gukora igitabo.
It was good and easy.	Byari byiza kandi byoroshye.
But not here, not now.	Ariko si hano, si ubu.
I have a lot of problems.	Mfite ibibazo byinshi.
You have to get it !.	Ugomba kubona!.
I can't see well.	Sinshobora kubona neza.
How close.	Niki hafi.
He was only three at the time.	Icyo gihe yari afite imyaka itatu gusa.
It seems to be very good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza cyane.
Everything is the way it is.	Ibintu byose ni uburyo.
He was never afraid.	Ntiyigeze agira ubwoba.
I know it was your first car.	Nzi ko yari imodoka yawe bwa mbere.
I think he wants this question.	Ntekereza ko ashaka iki kibazo.
I should have gone back.	Nari nkwiye gusubira inyuma.
He has to do it all the time.	Agomba kubikora buri gihe.
He is a bad person.	Ni umuntu mubi.
I did nothing.	Ntacyo nakoze.
That's right here.	Nibyo hano.
I saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe nabonye.
He was human at the time.	Icyo gihe yari umuntu.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga rwose.
You are not only beautiful.	Ntabwo uri mwiza gusa.
We had a lot.	Twari dufite byinshi.
Here, here.	Hano, hano.
In the upper room.	Mu cyumba cyo hejuru.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It is good and it is bad.	Ni mwiza kandi ni mubi.
It’s not really food.	Ntabwo rwose ari ibiryo.
It was simple and easy.	Byari byoroshye kandi byoroshye.
But time is the same.	Ariko igihe ni kimwe.
I'm so glad you have it here.	Nishimiye cyane kuba ufite hano.
He came to live with me now.	Yaje kubana nanjye ubu.
I have to eat well.	Ngomba kurya neza.
You can be very helpful.	Urashobora gufasha cyane.
That's right.	Nukuri.
How can you get to the top?	Nigute ushobora kubona hejuru?.
It's the same problem.	Ni ikibazo kimwe.
It was always nice to be around her.	Buri gihe byari byiza kuba hafi ye.
Is it possible to go wrong ?.	Birashoboka kugenda nabi?.
I want to see what you think.	Ndashaka kureba icyo utekereza.
I didn't want to.	Ntabwo nari nashakaga.
They were on top of me.	Bari hejuru yanjye.
I have things to do during the week.	Mfite ibintu byo gukora mu cyumweru.
It all looks so good.	Byose birasa cyane.
It's a good morning.	Hari mu gitondo cyiza.
He is going to try to find food.	Agiye kugerageza gushaka ibiryo.
Ngomba.	Ngomba.
The child may be his son.	Umwana arashobora kuba umuhungu we.
He feels good.	Yumva neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko uri hejuru cyane.
It's very clear.	Biragaragara cyane.
I have another problem.	Mfite ikindi kibazo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That is what he could have done.	Ibyo ni byo yashoboraga gufata.
I didn't get the chance to do it.	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe yo kubikora.
That's not the way it is.	Ntabwo ari uburyo wabikoze.
I had no problem with that.	Ntabwo nagize ikibazo kuri ibyo.
Someone like him.	Umuntu nka we.
It was really nice they didn't have it.	Mubyukuri yari mwiza ntabwo bari bafite.
You are my reason.	Ni wowe mpamvu yanjye.
And he looked very good.	Kandi yasaga neza cyane.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You have to work on that.	Ugomba gukora kuri ibyo.
And it was not a mistake.	Kandi ntabwo byari amakosa.
He wants to know the truth.	Ashaka kumenya ukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He had everything he wanted.	Yari afite ibyo yashakaga byose.
He did something wrong.	Hari ikintu kibi yakoze.
Or is it not close.	Cyangwa se ntabwo ari hafi.
And that's exactly what he thought.	Kandi icyo ni cyo yatekerezaga.
He had no money.	Ntiyari afite amafaranga.
I did nothing yesterday.	Ntacyo nakoze ejo.
Not good, but close.	Ntabwo ari byiza, ariko hafi.
It was behind me.	Byari inyuma yanjye.
Here are some of the ones I found to be interesting:	Hano hari ibintu byiza cyane.
he said.	yavuze.
Well, at least they didn't go down without explaining themselves first.	Nibyiza, birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I don't believe in anything.	Ntabwo nizera ikintu na kimwe.
It's not hard to do.	Ntabwo bigoye gukora.
I am very tall.	Ndi hejuru cyane.
I think it worked out.	Ndatekereza ko byagenze neza.
I had a wife, once.	Nari mfite umugore, rimwe.
I wanted that.	Nashakaga aho.
You are not sure if that is the case.	Ntabwo uzi neza niba aribyo.
I enjoy living and letting go.	Nishimiye kubaho no kureka kubaho.
I didn't need help.	Sinari nkeneye ubufasha.
He is very professional.	Ni umuhanga cyane.
Apparently he was scared too.	Biragaragara ko na we yari afite ubwoba.
I think that is possible.	Ntekereza ko ibyo bishoboka.
'	'
When he chooses what he says.	Iyo yahisemo icyo avuga.
I like to read.	Nkunda gusoma.
We all need someone to look down on.	Twese dukeneye umuntu wo kureba hasi.
Impossible.	Ntabwo bishoboka.
For everyone.	Kuri buri wese.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko atagomba kumva ikintu na kimwe.
I'm really worried.	Mfite impungenge rwose.
His opinion is true.	Igitekerezo cye ni ukuri.
There is a space of thirty.	Hari umwanya wa mirongo itatu.
It was very difficult to walk.	Kugenda byari bigoye rwose.
Nowhere.	Nta na hamwe.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
Take time.	Gufata umwanya.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
It's easy.	Ni ibintu byoroshye.
He wanted things.	Yashakaga ibintu.
You weren't here that morning.	Ntabwo wari hano muri icyo gitondo.
You have a lot to think about.	Ufite ibintu byinshi byo gutekereza.
She may be a child.	Ashobora kuba umwana.
I was not bad.	Ntabwo nari mubi.
He was ready to go again.	Yari yiteguye kongera kugenda.
Everyone together now.	Abantu bose hamwe ubu.
I didn't know much about it.	Ntabwo nari nzi neza ikintu kinini.
In this case.	Muri iki kibazo.
Or if it was a plan.	Cyangwa iyo yari gahunda.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
And he was.	Kandi yari.
No reason.	Nta mpamvu.
He eventually came to his senses.	Amaherezo yaje aho ari.
No one did.	Nta n'umwe wigeze akora.
One thing you are doing right now.	Ikintu kimwe urimo ukora ubu.
He needed to know.	Yari akeneye kumenya.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Kugeza ubu, nta muntu n'umwe wabonye.
There is so much to catch.	Hariho byinshi cyane byo gufata.
He does nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe akora.
He went as usual.	Yagiye nk'uko bisanzwe.
I know a woman well now.	Nzi umugore neza ubu.
This is not normal.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
From top to bottom.	Kuva hejuru kugeza hasi.
It's not close enough.	Ntabwo ari hafi bihagije.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
There is absolutely no turning back.	Ntabwo rwose nta gusubira inyuma.
Like everyone else.	Kimwe na bose.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
You should have lived.	Wari ukwiye kubaho.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
He didn’t want to think bad things.	Ntiyashakaga ko atekereza ikintu kibi.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
This is everything.	Ibi ni ibintu byose.
And he was still.	Kandi yari akiri.
I don't think so.	Ntabwo ntekereza.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
And it is his fault.	Kandi ni amakosa ye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ubu aricyo gihe.
But, everything is fine.	Ariko, byose ni byiza.
This is not me! 	Uyu ntabwo ari njye!
.	.
Tell me what happened.	Mbwira uko byagenze.
Like, really.	Nka, mubyukuri.
This was difficult.	Ibi byari bigoye.
I am an expert after all.	Ndi umuhanga nyuma ya byose.
I never wanted to be a beautiful girl.	Sinigeze nshaka kuba umukobwa mwiza.
Not here today.	Ntabwo ari hano muri iki gihe.
I don't know what you look like.	Sinzi uko usa.
Far from him.	Kure kure ye.
He left quickly.	Yagiye vuba.
But he is not.	Ariko si we.
I have a plan.	Mfite gahunda.
I'm eating.	Ndimo kurya.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
There is also a book.	Hariho kandi igitabo.
He is doing well.	Arimo akora neza.
It's not scary.	Ntabwo ari ubwoba.
It would have been nice if he had come.	Iyo yaje byari kuba byiza.
There is no one here.	Nta muntu n'umwe hano.
And he was good enough.	Kandi yari mwiza bihagije.
He is very confident.	Yizeye cyane.
Waiting to learn more.	Gutegereza kwiga byinshi.
It looks really high.	Birasa hejuru rwose.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He probably needed food.	Birashoboka ko yari akeneye ibiryo.
He lives in us.	Aba muri twe.
And he could trust everything he needed.	Kandi yashoboraga kwizera ibyo akeneye byose.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
But we must believe.	Ariko tugomba kwizera.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But he did not know for sure.	Ariko ntiyari azi neza.
But we must be aware of this.	Ariko tugomba kumenya neza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I was really good.	Nari mwiza rwose.
It was good, very good.	Byari byiza, byiza cyane.
Maybe he shouldn't have said anything.	Birashoboka ko atari akwiye kugira icyo avuga.
One had gone.	Umwe yari yagiye.
I was looking for something at home.	Nashakaga ikintu murugo.
This one had.	Uyu yari afite.
Or a problem.	Cyangwa ikibazo.
But you can do the same.	Ariko nawe urashobora kubikora.
You don't have to talk to anyone right now.	Ntugomba kuvugana numuntu nonaha.
When he was young	Igihe yari akiri muto.
You have it all.	Ufite byose.
He took the woman outside.	Yafashe umugore hanze.
I think it would be nice.	Ntekereza ko byaba byiza.
He is also a good person.	Arimo kandi kuba umuntu mwiza.
This is not good.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
And for him.	Kandi kuri we.
He didn't need to comment.	Ntiyari akeneye kugira icyo avuga.
But no one was.	Ariko nta n'umwe yari.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
He has to think.	Agomba gutekereza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
Whatever he did.	Ibyo ari byo byose yabikoze.
That's great to say.	Nibyiza cyane kuvuga.
There are many before him.	Hariho benshi mbere ye.
Everything was simple.	Ibintu byose byari byoroshye.
He had a good friend.	Yari afite inshuti nziza.
He has no plans, not really.	Ntabwo afite gahunda, ntabwo mubyukuri.
They never live.	Nta na rimwe aba.
They are very ashamed.	Bafite isoni cyane.
He is here.	Ari hano.
I have never seen so many.	Sinigeze mbona benshi cyane.
You have to do one or the other.	Ugomba gukora kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
If he is lucky.	Niba afite amahirwe.
Sometimes very.	Rimwe na rimwe cyane.
It is very good and good.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byiza.
I feel ashamed.	Ndumva mfite isoni.
That's a long way off.	Ibyo ni kure cyane.
My daughter or child.	Umukobwa wanjye cyangwa umwana.
It was always great.	Buri gihe byari byiza rwose.
I really want someone to do that.	Ndashaka cyane ko umuntu abikora.
He had gone out.	Yari yagiye hanze.
He was not ready.	Ntabwo yari yiteguye.
He did not ask.	Ntabwo yabajije.
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka kuba hano.
It's as good as ever.	Nibyiza nka mbere.
And he was behind.	Kandi yari inyuma.
You're going to drive.	Ugiye gutwara.
But he knew the truth.	Ariko yari azi ukuri.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose ari ukuri.
No one did.	Nta n'umwe wigeze akora.
But not for long.	Ariko nta gihe kinini.
We need more food.	Dukeneye ibiryo byinshi.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
Not too high, obviously.	Ntabwo ari hejuru cyane, biragaragara.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
The view is far away.	Kureba ni kure.
It's a job, after all.	Ni akazi, nyuma ya byose.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
We have the money to do it.	Dufite amafaranga yo kubikora.
But he had a chance to think.	Ariko yari afite amahirwe yo gutekereza.
She wore it fast.	Yambaye vuba.
I also have a way in school.	Mfite kandi uburyo mu ishuri.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
The space is out.	Umwanya uri hanze.
In fact that is possible.	Mubyukuri ibyo birashoboka.
One woman, alone.	Umugore umwe, wenyine.
In what he is doing now.	Mu byo arimo akora ubu.
Maybe you don't want to talk.	Birashoboka ko udashaka kuvuga.
It's good to go.	Nibyiza kugenda.
He tried.	Yagerageje.
I'm doing it.	Ndimo kubikora.
You found it easy.	Wabonye byoroshye.
He loves everyone.	Akunda abantu bose.
He needs help for a long time.	Akeneye ubufasha igihe kinini.
I thought he was far away.	Natekereje ko ari kure.
At that time it was almost over.	Icyo gihe byari hafi kureka kubaho.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Most at work.	Benshi mu kazi.
But it is very beautiful.	Ariko ni mwiza cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko nawe wabikoze.
We have to hear, we have to hear.	Tugomba kumva, tugomba kumva.
Apparently he enjoyed everything.	Biragaragara ko yishimiye ibintu byose.
Nothing.	Ntacyo.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
I can wait.	Nshobora gutegereza.
Go back, shame.	Gusubira inyuma, isoni.
Very nice person	Umuntu mwiza cyane.
We are good friends	Turi inshuti nziza.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
I like to read good books.	Nkunda gusoma igitabo cyiza.
Or one of them.	Cyangwa kimwe muri byo.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
It is not.	Ntabwo ari.
I hope you can help.	Ndizera ko ushobora gufasha.
You know what everyone thinks.	Uzi icyo buri wese atekereza.
I wanted to know why.	Nashakaga kumenya impamvu.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
This was a short time.	Uyu wari umwanya muto.
I want to know what he knows.	Ndashaka kumenya icyo azi.
He went.	Yagiye.
He can't speak.	Ntashobora kuvuga.
They have nothing for me.	Ntacyo bafite kuri njye.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
I didn't want to stop.	Sinifuzaga guhagarika.
It's a great gift.	Ni impano nziza.
He got a job.	Yabonye akazi.
I really like the movie.	Nkunda cyane firime.
I saw that.	Nabonye ko.
It’s just a matter of getting an idea.	Ni ikibazo cyo kubona igitekerezo gusa.
He had no time for anyone.	Ntiyari afite umwanya ku muntu uwo ari we wese.
All of me	Ninjye wose.
I know who you are.	Nzi uwo uri we.
Bad speech.	Kuvuga nabi.
I thought he looked very good at the time.	Natekereje ko asa neza cyane icyo gihe.
As if he had done it.	Nkaho yigeze abikora.
Always for him.	Buri gihe kuri we.
I was scared to be here like that.	Nari mfite ubwoba bwo kuba hano gutya.
He really was.	Yari we rwose.
I didn't know if he would do it.	Sinari nzi niba azabikora.
That's not the case.	Ntabwo aribyo cyane.
He must also come.	Agomba kandi kuza.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I think this is a good time.	Ntekereza ko iki ari igihe cyiza.
There is another problem.	Hariho ikindi kibazo.
You really have to see all that.	Ugomba rwose kubona ibyo byose.
I always thought.	Natekerezaga buri gihe.
Very one.	Umwe cyane.
After all.	Nyuma ya byose.
I love everyone.	Nkunda abantu bose.
This is great.	Ubu ni byiza cyane.
Nothing for me.	Ntacyo kuri njye.
He thought it was possible.	Yatekereje ko bishoboka.
You got the look.	Wabonye kureba.
If anything, he seemed scared.	Niba hari ikintu, yasaga nkaho yari afite ubwoba.
He was having a hard time thinking.	Yari afite ikibazo cyo gutekereza neza.
I know it's not your fault.	Nzi ko atari amakosa yawe.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
I have to work too.	Nanjye ngomba gukora.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba gukora kimwe gusa.
The kids were coming home soon.	Abana bari gutaha vuba.
This is not an easy task.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
And he felt ashamed.	Kandi yumvise afite isoni.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari we.
He does as he pleases.	Abikora uko ashaka.
It’s not just the hair.	Ntabwo ari umusatsi gusa.
I had a beautiful girl.	Nari mfite umukobwa mwiza.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
He is one young man.	Ni umusore umwe.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
And he meant.	Kandi yashakaga kuvuga.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
I know you are.	Nzi ko urimo.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
He told me he needed money.	Yambwiye ko akeneye amafaranga.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
Time to work.	Igihe cyo gukora.
Nothing.	Nta na kimwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Up and down.	Hejuru no hejuru.
Please ask for anything.	Nyamuneka nyamuneka gusaba ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba byiza.
But in reality.	Ariko mubyukuri.
Not the same thing.	Ntabwo aricyo kintu kimwe.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I made a lot of cars.	Nakoze imodoka nyinshi.
I guess everything is possible.	Ndakeka ko byose bishoboka.
Let's do it.	Reka reka.
I love home.	Nkunda murugo.
At that time I did not know.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi.
He just did it.	Yabikoze gusa.
We are good friends	Turi inshuti nziza.
It's a job.	Ni akazi.
You are worried.	Ufite impungenge.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
It is a beautiful house.	Ni inzu nziza.
I think he does.	Ndatekereza ko akora.
It's good for me.	Ni mwiza kuri njye.
But that was scary.	Ariko ibyo byari ubwoba.
He feels what he wants.	Yumva icyo ashaka.
It can't go well.	Ntashobora kugenda neza.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
But he needs money.	Ariko akeneye amafaranga.
I'm not going now.	Ntabwo ngiye ubu.
Sometimes that happens.	Rimwe na rimwe byagenze gutya.
There is a girl here.	Hano hari umukobwa.
Much to think about.	Byinshi byo gutekereza.
I am my person, not just your child.	Ndi umuntu wanjye, ntabwo ari umwana wawe gusa.
He saw it clearly and clearly.	Yabonye neza kandi neza.
We have enough problems.	Dufite ibibazo bihagije.
I never wanted to.	Ntabwo nigeze nshaka.
I was thinking of something yesterday.	Natekerezaga ku kintu ejo.
I really enjoyed reading it all.	Nishimiye cyane gusoma muri byose.
There is something wrong with him.	Hariho ikintu kibi kuri we.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari hafi yanjye.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
That would not be the case today.	Uyu munsi ntabwo byari kuba.
I didn't hear it all.	Ntabwo numvise byose.
We are very good friends.	Turi inshuti nziza rwose.
He didn't go.	Ntabwo yagiye.
You can tell me down.	Urashobora kumbwira hasi.
We must learn to trust the teacher.	Tugomba kwiga kwizera umwarimu.
I didn't find it easy.	Ntabwo nabonye byoroshye.
No one had an idea.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite igitekerezo.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
I'm not sure.	Ntabwo nzi neza.
You are not really.	Ntabwo uri mubyukuri.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
I knew the truth.	Nari nzi ukuri.
At a young age.	Akiri muto.
You have to have faith.	Ugomba kugira kwizera.
And money is a thing.	Kandi amafaranga ni ikintu.
He is not very happy with you.	Ntabwo yishimiye cyane nawe.
And he loves all people.	Kandi akunda abantu bose.
None of us can claim a higher position.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ushobora gusaba umwanya wo hejuru.
I'm very worried.	Mfite impungenge nyinshi.
I have a lot to say.	Mfite byinshi byo kuvuga.
He thinks he knows everything.	Yibwira ko azi byose.
It would have gone completely wrong.	Byari kugenda rwose.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ibyo byari hano.
He has to go play.	Agomba kujya gukina.
He didn't have to live.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubaho.
He was just wrong.	Gusa yari afite amakosa.
He does nothing for no reason.	Ntacyo akora nta mpamvu.
Not all of this is good.	Ntabwo ibyo byose ari byiza.
But not today.	Ariko si iki gihe.
I didn't know what he wanted.	Sinari nzi icyo yashakaga.
They always have it so far.	Buri gihe bafite kugeza ubu.
He had tried to go with her.	Yari yagerageje kujyana.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
Everything is fine now.	Ibintu byose ni byiza ubu.
All of this is possible.	Ibi byose birashoboka.
I work then.	Icyo gihe nkora.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Or something good to do.	Cyangwa ikintu cyiza cyo gukora.
I never saw it.	Ntabwo nigeze mbona.
I guess it’s all a matter of looking.	Ndakeka ko byose ari ikibazo cyo kureba.
And many were.	Kandi benshi bari.
This will be the case.	Ibi bizaba ibintu.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Yavuze ko ashaka kugura.
But she was a woman.	Ariko yari umugore.
It was not the only way.	Ntabwo yari uburyo gusa.
Or close to home.	Cyangwa hafi murugo.
His family had money.	Umuryango we wari ufite amafaranga.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bari, kuri.
Sometimes, it is possible.	Rimwe na rimwe, birashoboka.
But this is not true.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
I'm not sure who.	Sinzi neza uwo.
Tell someone everything.	Bwira umuntu ibintu byose.
It was a lot.	Byari byinshi.
It's a family, not a family.	Ni umuryango, ntabwo.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
He was not sure what to think.	Ntiyari azi neza icyo atekereza.
That was her daughter.	Uwo yari umukobwa we.
He wants his money.	Ashaka amafaranga ye.
Not really, you really can't.	Ntabwo rwose, mubyukuri ntushobora.
I'm ashamed now, ashamed.	Mfite isoni ubu, isoni.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yashakaga cyane vuba cyane.
Go back.	Gusubira inyuma.
He wanted to say more about her.	Yashakaga kuvuga byinshi kuri we.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I never liked it.	Sinigeze nkunda na gato.
I never found it difficult.	Sinigeze mbona ko bigoye.
A lot of money.	Amafaranga menshi.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
I know how you like it.	Nzi uburyo ukunda kubikora.
He would know what to do here.	Yari kumenya icyo gukora hano.
But he was lucky.	Ariko yari afite amahirwe.
He doesn't do a problem.	Ntabwo akora ikibazo.
He didn't look bad.	Ntabwo yarebye nabi.
And all together.	Kandi bose hamwe.
But not for long.	Ariko si igihe kirekire.
And that's really cool.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza rwose.
Having a plan to go back.	Kugira gahunda yo gusubira inyuma.
I'm going to have a wife.	Ngiye kugira umugore.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
He was here, in this house.	Yari hano, muri iyi nzu.
We have no time.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya.
I can be anything, anyone.	Nshobora kuba ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose, umuntu uwo ari we wese.
It was really bad, that one.	Yari mubi rwose, uwo.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
Or maybe that's the real problem.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo rwose.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
Bombi.	Bombi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo mubyukuri.
In fact, he wanted to do something good.	Mubyukuri, yashakaga gukora ikintu cyiza.
Yesterday was a good day.	Ejo wari umunsi mwiza.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
He didn’t have to drive, that’s what he chose.	Ntabwo yagombaga gutwara, ibyo nibyo yahisemo.
Probably not his father.	Birashoboka ko atari se.
That was great.	Ibyo byari byiza cyane.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nibyo.
And if we can do that, we can do anything.	Niba kandi dushobora gukora ibyo, dushobora gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Anyone can do it.	Umuntu wese arashobora kubikora.
What? 	Niki?
As if he never said.	Nkaho atigeze avuga.
I saw a lot.	Nabonye byinshi.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
No one was in the outside room.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari mu cyumba cyo hanze.
But he never did.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze abikora.
He knew he had to say a lot.	Yari azi ko agomba kuvuga byinshi.
It is not a mistake.	Ntabwo ari amakosa.
I wanted to add to this.	Nashakaga kongera kuri ibi.
He is ahead of time.	Ari imbere icyo gihe.
Many, many, many.	Byinshi, byinshi, byinshi.
He also told me that.	Yambwiye kandi ibyo.
Until now he would have stayed.	Kugeza ubu yari kuguma.
First of all.	Mbere ya byose.
He was not alone.	Ntabwo yari wenyine.
They had nothing to say.	Nta cyo bari bafite cyo kuvuga.
He used to be human.	Yigeze kuba umuntu.
I have to think.	Ngomba gutekereza.
I can't stay here all the time.	Ntashobora kuguma hano igihe cyose.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was time to look ahead.	Wari igihe cyo kureba imbere.
I feel really good.	Numva rwose ari byiza.
He had a good idea.	Yari afite igitekerezo cyiza.
But for everyone.	Ariko kuri buri wese.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ibi byoroshye.
And that's exactly what happened.	Kandi ibi ni byo rwose.
It was good that he came here.	Byari byiza ko yaje hano.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
But no one knew where he was.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi aho ari.
He was not sure why, however.	Ntabwo yari azi neza impamvu, ariko.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Good car.	Imodoka nziza.
They don't know what it is.	Ntabwo bazi icyo ari cyo.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
That's all we can do.	Ni ibyo dushobora gukora byose.
You may want to look at your beautiful home.	Urashobora gushaka kureba inzu yawe nziza.
And he can be lucky.	Kandi arashobora kugira amahirwe.
I want to say something else before I get out of that.	Ndashaka kuvuga ikindi kintu mbere yo kuva muri ibyo.
He wanted to do it.	Yashakaga kubikora.
Not really.	Ntabwo mubyukuri.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
We are all good friends.	Twese turi inshuti nziza.
He was far from me.	Yari kure yanjye.
He was definitely behind her.	Rwose yari inyuma ye.
That is a real opportunity for us.	Ibyo ni amahirwe rwose kuri twe.
He had.	Yari afite.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He now has a job.	Ubu afite akazi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
My family is the same.	Umuryango wanjye ni kimwe.
But he was there.	Ariko yari ahari.
He would not say much.	Ntabwo yari kuvuga byinshi.
I was a good teacher.	Nari umwarimu mwiza.
He went.	Yagiye.
I can do this.	Nshobora gukora iki kibazo.
We need them.	Dukeneye ko aba.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
And he.	Na we.
Not until very late.	Ntabwo kugeza nyuma cyane.
The car is everything.	Imodoka ni byose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Anyway.	Ibyo ari byo byose.
It was really good for him.	Byari byiza rwose kuri we.
You have to do it.	Ugomba kubikora.
That, too, went wrong.	Ibyo na byo byagenze nabi.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
It was good to eat.	Byari byiza kurya.
No one was inside.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uri imbere.
You would do whatever you wanted.	Wari gukora ibyo ushaka byose.
You can.	Ushobora.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
As we finally are.	Nkuko amaherezo turi.
I'm going to drive.	Ngiye gutwara.
But for me.	Ariko kuri njye.
It was a way.	Byari uburyo.
He should know that you have.	Agomba kumenya ko ufite.
He probably has enough problems.	Birashoboka ko afite ibibazo bihagije.
Not at all possible.	Ntabwo bishoboka rwose.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
He was scared.	Yari afite ubwoba.
He had a problem.	Yari afite ikibazo.
He saw nothing.	Ntacyo yabonye.
And he.	Na we.
He never had problems.	Ntabwo yigeze agira ibibazo.
We need one more thing.	Dukeneye ikindi kintu kimwe.
We had to feel that we could do something else.	Twari dufite kumva ko dushobora gukora ikindi kintu.
It was a great experience for me.	Byari ibintu byiza rwose kuri njye.
This is what he expected.	Ibi nibyo yari yiteze.
Everything in the end.	Ibintu byose amaherezo.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
You know what happened.	Uzi uko byagenze.
Thoughtful, possible.	Gutekereza neza, birashoboka.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
That's not the case with this movie.	Ntabwo aribyo muri iyi firime.
He says he is not here.	Avuga ko atari hano.
Obviously you have a gift.	Biragaragara ko ufite impano.
He loved everything.	Yakundaga buri kintu cyose.
On time as usual.	Ku gihe nkuko bisanzwe.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
He did not do it alone.	Ntabwo yabikoze wenyine.
I hope he only knows the chances.	Nizere ko azi amahirwe gusa.
What an idea.	Igitekerezo ni iki.
The bus went first.	Bisi yagiye mbere.
He is a bad guy.	Ni umusore mubi.
I don’t have to look at a lot of people.	Ntabwo ngomba kureba abantu benshi.
You love your money.	Ukunda amafaranga yawe.
He said he was the only one.	Yavuze ko ari we wenyine.
It was not me.	Ntabwo yari njye.
He wants to talk to you.	Yifuza kuvugana nawe.
I want to talk to you again.	Ndashaka kongera kuvugana nawe.
And it’s not good enough to go back.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza bihagije gusubira inyuma.
There's a phone here.	Hano hari terefone.
She looked good.	Yasaga naho ari mwiza.
I was not sure what to do.	Sinari nzi neza icyo yari gukora.
I like swimming.	Nkunda koga.
He would take nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari gufata.
He needed more.	Yari akeneye byinshi.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo kuvuga.
Stop going.	Reka kugenda.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
It is very good and good.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byiza.
It was his family.	Yari umuryango we.
But all in all.	Ariko byose ariko.
I have money.	Mfite amafaranga.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
He said he needed his own time.	Yavuze ko akeneye umwanya we wenyine.
He seems to have thought of us, in fact.	Asa naho yatekereje kuri twe, mubyukuri.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It is your chance to live.	Ni amahirwe yawe yo kubaho.
Finding the truth.	Kubona ukuri.
He speaks quickly.	Avuga vuba.
Good time to all !.	Igihe cyiza kuri bose!.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
Probably not your best friend.	Birashoboka ko atari inshuti yawe rwose.
At that point he had to leave.	Icyo gihe yagombaga kugenda.
We are difficult people.	Turi abantu bigoye.
All of this is good for.	Ibi byose ni byiza kuri.
He was one of us.	Yari umwe muri twe.
You can't see very well.	Ntushobora kubona neza cyane.
You too can believe the same thing.	Nawe urashobora kwizera ikintu kimwe.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
He did well and it was great.	Yakoze neza kandi byari byiza.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.
Not tomorrow.	Ntabwo ari ejo.
He had begun to look ahead.	Yari yatangiye kureba imbere.
And he would win.	Kandi yari gutsinda.
That? 	Ibyo?
He didn't know where to go.	Ntiyari azi aho agomba kujya.
I don't want to look too far.	Sinshaka kureba kure cyane.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
I wonder why ?.	Ndabaza impamvu?.
And you have.	Kandi ufite.
.	.
In that case,.	Icyo gihe ,.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi bishoboka.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
I don't want to do that.	Sinshaka kubikora.
What he has to do.	Icyo agomba kugira.
He needs time.	Akeneye umwanya.
Definitely that day.	Rwose uwo munsi.
You didn't say there was a dog.	Ntabwo wavuze ko hariho imbwa.
That's all.	Ibyo aribyo byose.
He tried to drink.	Yagerageje kunywa.
She was beautiful, and she was alone.	Yari mwiza cyane, kandi yari wenyine.
He was a man like me.	Yari umuntu nkanjye.
The first meeting for him.	Inama ya mbere kuri we.
That's all he did.	Ibyo ni byo yakoze byose.
You really have to stop being a good guy.	Ugomba rwose kureka kuba umusore mwiza.
And that's exactly what we need.	Kandi ibyo nibyo tugomba.
You are a good young man.	Uri umusore mwiza.
This was true and true.	Ibi byari ukuri kandi mubyukuri.
Apparently he chose to tell me.	Biragaragara ko yahisemo kumbwira.
Good day, just a good day.	Umunsi mwiza, gusa umunsi mwiza.
I didn't see anyone.	Nta muntu nabonye.
We can't say for sure.	Ntidushobora kuvuga neza.
I don't think this will happen soon.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ibi bizaba vuba.
It is a whole family.	Ni umuryango wose.
Same as usual.	Kimwe nkuko bisanzwe.
It would be nice to see both.	Bizaba byiza kubona bombi.
I think he was good.	Ndakeka ko yari mwiza.
Leaving money.	Kureka amafaranga.
How to do it.	Uburyo bwo kubikora.
I now have a daughter.	Ubu mfite umukobwa.
And all in all, it will be great in the end.	Kandi byose, amaherezo bizaba byiza.
He says he didn't.	Avuga ko atabikoze.
I am now.	Ubu ndimo.
He spoke well of everything.	Yavuze neza cyane kuri buri kintu cyose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I love you too.	Nkunda na njye.
I had a bad time at the time.	Nabonye nabi icyo gihe.
And, there is something else.	Kandi, hariho ikindi kintu.
It was a thing.	Byari ibintu.
There is a problem here.	Hano hari ikibazo.
You are right.	Uri ukuri.
I don't want to study.	Sinshaka kwiga.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose ari rwose.
I think that's exactly what happened.	Ntekereza ko aribyo rwose.
There is not much to learn.	Nta byinshi byo kwiga.
Maybe he wanted her to do something.	Birashoboka ko yashakaga ko agira icyo akora.
She desperately needs hair.	Akeneye cyane umusatsi.
Going backwards.	Gusubira inyuma hejuru.
I want to be on this.	Ndashaka kuba kuri ibi.
He would have nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari kugira.
He was his friend.	Yari inshuti ye.
He got a job.	Yabonye akazi.
On the issue however.	Ku kibazo ariko.
This was normal.	Ibi byari bisanzwe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane, bombi.
This went wrong.	Ibi byagenze nabi.
But to have someone on the ground.	Ariko kugira umuntu hasi.
He did a lot of planning.	Yakoze byinshi muri gahunda.
Up and down.	Hejuru hasi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
You are here alone sometimes.	Uri hano wenyine rimwe na rimwe.
He meant people.	Yashakaga kuvuga abantu.
Maybe a movie.	Ahari firime.
He never lived in a house.	Ntiyigeze aba mu nzu.
What about everyone.	Ni iki kuri buri wese.
He went.	Yagiye.
He feels it all the time.	Yumva buri gihe.
You can't do it alone.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine.
All of this is normal.	Ibyo byose ni ibintu bisanzwe.
I'm not close.	Ntabwo ndi hafi.
Something he likes.	Ikintu akunda.
And something to eat.	Kandi ikintu cyo kurya.
I am not doing anything wrong.	Nta kibi ndimo gukora.
We have no problem.	Nta kibazo dufite.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
He knows what he's talking about.	Azi ibyo avuga.
And I don’t want to think.	Kandi ntashaka gutekereza.
He was the only one here.	Yari wenyine wenyine hano.
What did he think?	Yatekereje iki?
I thought of you a lot.	Natekereje kuri wowe byinshi.
He wanted to go to work.	Yashakaga kujya ku kazi.
He said all the good things.	Yavuze ibintu byose byiza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
Why not.	Kuki atari byo.
Wisdom is a woman.	Ubwenge ni umugore.
You know what the plan is.	Uzi gahunda icyo aricyo.
Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.
My house is an idea.	Inzu yanjye ni igitekerezo.
I'm inside.	Ndi imbere.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
It was a really good idea.	Byari igitekerezo cyiza rwose.
There are a lot of problems though.	Hariho ibibazo byinshi ariko.
He doesn't know exactly what we need.	Ntabwo azi neza icyo dukeneye.
I'm glad you did.	Nishimiye ko wabikoze.
However, you may also be wrong.	Ariko, urashobora kandi kuba atari byo.
Everything you can do.	Ibyo ushobora gukora byose.
He has it all.	Afite byose.
I did the same.	Nakoze kimwe.
Really like him.	Mubyukuri nka we.
As usual.	Nkuko bisanzwe.
He came to where I am.	Yaje aho ndi.
He chose that morning.	Yahisemo muri icyo gitondo.
But he could see nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona aho yari ari.
I was really scared for a while.	Nagize ubwoba rwose mugihe gito.
Same morning.	Buri gitondo kimwe.
He had it all.	Yari afite byose.
He could be anyone.	Yashoboraga kuba umuntu uwo ari we wese.
He really wants to help.	Arashaka rwose gufasha.
He could always read to people.	Buri gihe yashoboraga gusoma abantu.
He asked when.	Yabajije igihe.
Always out and about.	Buri gihe hanze kandi hafi.
None of this is your fault.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari amakosa yawe.
But if it's really good.	Ariko niba ari byiza rwose.
It was too much.	Yari menshi cyane.
Tell the boy.	Bwira ibyo umuhungu.
He may be completely within you and he cannot be.	Ashobora kuba muri wowe rwose kandi ntashobora.
Obviously that is it.	Biragaragara ko aribyo.
He doesn’t think before he does something.	Ntatekereza mbere yuko agira icyo akora.
And you can be.	Kandi urashobora kuba.
He had a family.	Yari afite umuryango.
But it is good.	Ariko ni mwiza.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
Inside, he could sense the fear and wait.	Imbere, yashoboraga kumenya ubwoba no gutegereza.
But he was right.	Ariko yari afite ukuri.
It is not a long time.	Ntabwo ari igihe kirekire.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
It was good where he wanted to be.	Byari byiza aho yashakaga kuba.
The woman meant nothing.	Umugore ntacyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He had come.	Yari yaje.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
He was obviously a bad person.	Biragaragara ko yari umuntu mubi.
But for him that was enough.	Ariko kuri we ibyo byari bihagije.
And he.	Naho we.
Apparently they were right.	Birasa naho bari bafite ukuri.
Very nice guy	Umusore mwiza cyane.
He needed to be.	Yari akeneye kuba.
They were not human.	Ntabwo bari abantu.
There was a time when he had.	Hari igihe yari afite.
I am not.	Nanjye sibyo.
The day was beautiful.	Umunsi wari mwiza.
It was all too much.	Byose byari byinshi cyane.
I love living with you.	Nkunda kubana nawe.
They have a son.	Bafite umuhungu.
You go here.	Ugiye hano.
.	.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I want to do better.	Ndashaka gukora neza.
If you are, you are.	Niba uri, uri.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
He doesn’t feel like a book.	Ntabwo yumva ari igitabo.
I thought of a plan.	Natekereje gahunda.
It is not always easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byoroshye.
Who do you like the most ?.	Ninde ukunda cyane?.
not much.	si byinshi.
There is food.	Hariho ibiryo.
I have no one now.	Nta muntu mfite ubu.
I also wanted to talk.	Nanjye nashakaga kuvuga.
We need a lot of money.	Dukeneye amafaranga menshi.
They are at school.	Bari ku ishuri.
It's not money at all.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga na gato.
I feel like me.	Ndumva ari nkanjye.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, byose ni byiza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I just know the truth is a good thing.	Gusa nzi ko ukuri ari ikintu cyiza.
It was a lot.	Yari menshi.
It's good to talk.	Kuvuga ni byiza.
This thing is wise.	Iki kintu ni ubwenge.
He had no time to think.	Ntiyari afite umwanya wo gutekereza.
Anyone can help.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese arashobora gufasha.
I have a lot of money.	Mfite amafaranga menshi.
But that is not what you need.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo ukeneye.
No one knew what he was trying to do.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo yashakaga gukora.
He can get a book.	Arashobora kubona igitabo.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
The food is excellent.	Ibiryo ni byiza cyane.
If he wanted to know, that's fine.	Niba yashakaga kumenya, nibyiza.
He came very close.	Yaje hafi cyane.
He took the time to leave the house.	Yafashe igihe cyo kuva mu nzu.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
Money.	Amafaranga.
His opinion.	Igitekerezo cye.
You can't be bad.	Ntushobora kuba mubi.
That's really possible.	Ibyo rwose birashoboka.
He would have accepted anything.	Yaba yemeye ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
My car was my baby.	Imodoka yanjye yari umwana wanjye.
He wanted to play.	Yashakaga gukina.
He is in all of us.	Ari muri twese.
I saw him work before.	Nabonye akora mbere.
And he needs to win.	Kandi akeneye gutsinda.
And not at all.	Kandi si na gato.
He meant a lot to many.	Yashakaga kuvuga byinshi kuri benshi.
Anyone.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I found my friend.	Nabonye inshuti yanjye.
But everything is possible.	Ariko ibintu byose birashoboka.
I'm not reading.	Ntabwo ndimo gusoma.
They have talents, but they are not.	Bafite impano, ariko sibyo.
He did not expect this.	Ntabwo yari yiteze ibi.
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
He always does.	Buri gihe abikora.
I think about going.	Ndatekereza kugenda.
He seemed to think.	Yasaga naho atekereza.
One good, one bad.	Umwe mwiza, umwe mubi.
One of the many.	Umwe muri benshi.
I had a great swim.	Nagize koga cyane.
He is the only one who can speak.	Niwe wenyine ushobora kuvuga.
Nothing wrong.	Nta kibi.
I got a phone call at work.	Nabonye terefone ku kazi.
I am a teacher.	Ndi umwarimu.
He made money.	Yakoze amafaranga.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu icyo aricyo cyose.
Probably not good.	Birashoboka ko atari byiza.
He didn’t want to play.	Ntiyashakaga gukina.
You can watch it here.	Urashobora kureba hano.
He came later.	Yaje nyuma.
He bought things.	Yaguze ibintu.
'	'
You should have won.	Wari ukwiye gutsinda.
You were close.	Wari hafi.
One place was still there.	Umwanya umwe yari akiri.
For all of us, in fact.	Kuri twese, mubyukuri.
They have none.	Ntabwo bafite.
She has a child.	Afite umwana.
You have to apply.	Ugomba gusaba.
I hope you like this one.	Nizere ko ukunda iyi.
He has.	Afite.
It was always very easy.	Buri gihe byari byoroshye cyane.
That was a lot.	Ibyo byari byinshi.
I like food.	Nkunda ibiryo.
All of this is up to you.	Ibi byose niwowe.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You can have a bad day.	Urashobora kugira umunsi mubi.
But he had found a friend.	Ariko yari yabonye inshuti.
You need to live.	Ukeneye kubaho.
This was one.	Uyu yari umwe.
He now had a family.	Ubu yari afite umuryango.
You have to stay with me.	Ugomba kuguma hamwe nanjye.
But with us.	Ariko hamwe natwe.
Anything and everything.	Ikintu cyose na byose.
But he was a really good guy.	Ariko yari umusore mwiza rwose.
He wanted to know.	Yashakaga kumenya.
But there is also a higher person.	Ariko hariho n'umuntu wo hejuru.
He has a plan in everything.	Afite gahunda muri byose.
that's right	nibyo.
You can trust whatever you want.	Urashobora kwizera ibyo ushaka byose.
It was a great plan.	Byari gahunda nziza.
It would be easy to take.	Byaba byoroshye gufata.
It was a lot for him now.	Byari byinshi kuri we ubu.
Only me and him from the beginning.	Gusa ni njye na we kuva mbere.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
I did not know.	Sinari nzi.
But you have none of that.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo ufite.
For her, she was a beautiful woman.	Kuri we, yari umugore mwiza cyane.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He knows what to do.	Yaba azi icyo gukora.
There is so much he doesn't know.	Hariho byinshi atari azi.
He is sitting there.	Yicaye aho.
He should have known where he was.	Yari akwiye kumenya aho yari ari.
Someone needs what you have.	Umuntu akeneye ibyo ufite.
Everything you need to think.	Ibintu byose ukeneye gutekereza.
It was just a matter of time.	Byari ibintu gusa.
I was close yesterday.	Ejo nari hafi.
Here are some great things to know.	Hano hari ibintu byiza cyane kumenya.
He did not want to be alone.	Ntiyashakaga kuba wenyine.
I was embarrassed.	Nagize isoni.
We were here.	Twari hano.
It's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
He was also young.	Na we yari muto.
He did not say exactly what it was.	Ntiyigeze avuga neza icyo ari cyo.
This was true.	Ibi byari ukuri.
Her beautiful son.	Umuhungu we mwiza.
I believe we should.	Nizera ko tugomba.
Here.	Hano.
I can't wait !!.	Sinshobora gutegereza !!.
He must know for sure.	Agomba kumenya neza.
I did nothing good here.	Nta cyiza nigeze nkora hano.
I can look up.	Nshobora kureba hejuru.
But you always knew he was out there.	Ariko buri gihe wari uziko ari hanze aha.
And he knows for sure that this is not the case.	Kandi azi neza ko atari byo.
Only once.	Rimwe rimwe gusa.
It's the same.	Ni kimwe.
They were right.	Bari bafite ukuri.
You don't have to.	Ntugomba.
There is so much he doesn't know.	Hariho byinshi atari azi.
Everything he wanted to do.	Ibyo yashakaga gukora byose.
He said something.	Hari icyo yavuze.
He would not say who.	Ntabwo yari kuvuga uwo.
One day, it is possible, but it is not.	Umunsi umwe, birashoboka, ariko sibyo.
I want to have that.	Ndashaka kugira ibyo.
His presence was good.	Kuba yari ahari byari byiza.
And you are here on time.	Kandi uri hano ku gihe.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
I was at work.	Nari akazi.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Sinzi neza ikibazo icyo aricyo cyose.
He tried to speak.	Yagerageje kuvuga.
It's too early.	Ni kare cyane.
You have this problem with film.	Ufite iki kibazo na firime.
That's good.	Nibyo byiza.
In fact, that's exactly what you have to do.	Mubyukuri, nibyo rwose ugomba gukora.
There is one last thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe cya nyuma.
But many things went wrong.	Ariko ibintu byinshi byagenze nabi.
Leave while you're at it.	Kureka mugihe uri imbere.
And no one could tell.	Kandi nta muntu n'umwe yashoboraga kubwira.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
More than people.	Kurenza abantu.
I can't carry a baby.	Sinshobora gutwara umwana.
He just does something good all the time.	Gusa akora ikintu cyiza igihe cyose.
That's right.	Nibyo.
He went.	Yagiye.
There is a chance here.	Hano hari amahirwe.
Probably not with him, until now.	Birashoboka ko atari na we, kugeza ubu.
Now it is working fine.	Ubu iri gukora neza.
It was hard to buy for no reason.	Byari bigoye kugura nta mpamvu.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntacyo.
He had no way of doing it.	Ntabwo yari afite uburyo bwo kubikora.
I think.	Ntekereza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aribyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It's a privilege.	Ni amahirwe.
She is beautiful	Niwe mwiza.
You can't imagine why, now.	Ntushobora gutekereza impamvu, nonaha.
Very good, that.	Byiza cyane, ibyo.
There is only the truth.	Hariho ukuri gusa.
And that's not me.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo ari nkanjye.
He did nothing.	Nta cyo yakoze.
I had no problem.	Nta kibazo na kimwe nagize.
What we are is for you.	Icyo turi cyo nawe.
I can easily find things.	Nshobora kubona ibintu byoroshye.
Many friends, many opportunities.	Inshuti nyinshi, amahirwe menshi.
It's too high.	Ni hejuru cyane.
I want to know why.	Ndashaka kumenya impamvu.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
He can play for a long time, and win.	Igihe kirekire arashobora gukina, no gutsinda.
Absolutely not.	Ntabwo rwose.
The boy did that.	Umuhungu yakoze ibyo.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
The car is money.	Imodoka ni amafaranga.
This is the back.	Iyi ni inyuma.
But that's exactly what he does.	Ariko ibyo nibyo akora.
It was on time.	Byari ku gihe.
And it is possible for us.	Kandi birashoboka kuri twe.
I need to talk to you.	Nkeneye kuvugana nawe.
He is here.	Ari hano.
It's not just one thing, it's a lot of things.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe gusa, ni ibintu byinshi.
You want to see everyone as possible.	Urashaka kubona abantu bose bishoboka.
But it is not inside.	Ariko ntabwo ari imbere.
He was expecting something else.	Yari yiteze ikindi kintu.
This is not easy.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye.
You don't have to talk to us.	Ntugomba kuvugana natwe.
It was normal for me.	Byari bisanzwe kuri njye.
You can talk to him.	Urashobora kuvugana na we.
He has something to drink.	Afite icyo kunywa.
Only this is true.	Gusa ibi ni ukuri.
That's right.	Nibyo.
What we can do.	Icyo dushobora gukora.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko abikora.
You are so beautiful.	Uri mwiza cyane.
Today is not the day.	Uyu munsi ntabwo ari umunsi.
I think we should do it.	Ntekereza ko tugomba kubikora.
He seems to be happy to be there.	Asa nkaho yishimiye kuba ahari.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
I can't stop thinking about this.	Sinshobora guhagarika gutekereza kuri ibi.
A young woman.	Umugore muto.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
I never saw it on top.	Sinigeze mbona ko ari hejuru.
He said it would be better.	Yavuze ko byaba byiza.
That's good.	Ni byiza.
I like movies.	Nkunda firime.
He is a very good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza rwose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It was on me.	Yari kuri njye.
He wanted to be there.	Yashakaga kuba ahari.
You don’t know what happened, well.	Ntabwo uzi uko byagenze, neza.
We cannot know the truth.	Ntidushobora kumenya ukuri.
He went a long way.	Yagiye kure.
He was lucky.	Yagize amahirwe.
All together	Byose hamwe.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
He did.	Yabikoze.
It's not close.	Ntabwo ari hafi.
Or not at all.	Cyangwa sibyo rwose.
But you know what.	Ariko uzi icyo aricyo.
His house was gone.	Inzu ye yari yagiye.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I know what he meant.	Nzi icyo yashakaga kuvuga.
He loved both.	Yakundaga bombi.
You can't understand why.	Ntushobora kumva impamvu.
I was looking for something else.	Nashakaga ikindi kintu.
I should have done that from the beginning.	Nari nkwiye kubikora kuva mbere.
Going well so far.	Kugenda neza kugeza ubu.
Maybe it's true.	Ahari ni ukuri.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
That is not a problem.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ikibazo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
It was good though.	Byari byiza ariko.
He goes on to say.	Agenda avuga.
He later realized that he had made a mistake.	Nyuma yaje kubona ko yakoze amakosa.
It was probably his age.	Birashoboka ko yari imyaka ye.
He did not do that.	Ibyo atabikoze.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nkuko atari byo.
But, the big thing.	Ariko, ikintu kinini.
To live again.	Kongera kubaho.
He had been there for three years.	Yari amaze imyaka itatu.
Here it is !.	Hano ari!.
Money was not his idea.	Amafaranga ntabwo yari igitekerezo cye.
You got the idea.	Wabonye igitekerezo.
Good time	Igihe cyiza.
He found a way to win.	Yabonye uburyo bwo gutsinda.
'	'
They don’t know exactly what to expect.	Ntabwo bazi neza icyo ugomba gutegereza.
.	.
You have no tomorrow and you have no tomorrow.	Ntabwo ejo ufite ejo kandi nta ejo ufite.
You saw that alone.	Wabonye ibyo wenyine.
I should have called.	Nari nkwiye kugira terefone.
You have to take years.	Ugomba gufata imyaka.
It was easy for him to work.	Byari byoroshye kuri we gukora.
Worth a look.	Nkwiye kureba.
I didn't want to talk to him.	Sinifuzaga kuvugana na we.
Reading was a way of thinking and speaking.	Gusoma byari uburyo bwo gutekereza no kuvuga.
He never spoke.	Ntiyigeze avuga.
All this time.	Iki gihe cyose.
This was normal and it was.	Ibi byari bisanzwe kandi byari.
It's an idea.	Ni igitekerezo.
Well done, bad day so far.	Nibyiza, umunsi mubi kugeza ubu.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka mbwira ko hari icyo uzi.
If not, you should.	Niba atari byo, ugomba.
He needed to drink.	Yari akeneye kunywa.
That was not the case.	Ntabwo byari byo.
Maybe for me.	Ahari kuri njye.
Or what he wanted.	Cyangwa icyo yashakaga.
He was alone in the room.	Yari wenyine mu cyumba.
Jobs, jobs, that's what he knew.	Akazi, akazi, nibyo yari azi.
It is not easy enough.	Ntabwo byoroshye bihagije.
It was not good.	Ntiyari mwiza.
I should try.	Nkwiye kugerageza.
It was good for me.	Kuri njye byari byiza.
He is in my house.	Ari mu nzu yanjye.
He had all the problems.	Yari afite ibibazo byose.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He needed to make money.	Yari akeneye gushaka amafaranga.
You know exactly what happened.	Uzi neza uko byagenze.
His last book.	Igitabo cye cya nyuma.
This is a lucky man.	Uyu ni umuntu ufite amahirwe.
For all of us.	Kuri twese.
The boy is beautiful.	Umuhungu ni mwiza.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
He was not very close at the time.	Icyo gihe ntabwo yari hafi cyane.
But it is possible that they were something else.	Ariko birashoboka ko bari ikindi kintu.
Everyone is good to be good.	Umuntu wese nibyiza kuba mwiza.
I have a small problem.	Mfite ikibazo gito.
It will not be far away.	Ntabwo bizaba kure.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
But really.	Ariko rwose.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye gukora.
I don't even want to do it.	Sinshaka no kubikora.
I want to know more about myself.	Ndashaka kumenya byinshi kuri njye.
Everyone here loves you.	Abantu bose hano ukunda.
He went to john.	Yagiye kuri john.
It will only happen once.	Bizaba rimwe gusa.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I don't know what to say.	Ntazi icyo avuga.
Very big thing.	Ikintu kinini cyane.
It was not just a matter of time.	Ntabwo byari ibintu gusa.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
No one said much.	Nta muntu wavuze byinshi.
Food is food.	Ibiryo ni ibiryo.
It was not difficult.	Ntabwo byari bigoye.
I'm not sorry about that.	Ntabwo mbabajwe nibyo.
But this is not the case with many.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo kuba benshi.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
And that's great.	Kandi nibyiza cyane.
.	.
But if there is anything you can do.	Ariko niba hari icyo ushobora gukora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko umusore ari muto.
He has a very high opinion of him.	Afite igitekerezo cyo hejuru cyane kuri we.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
But there was not much he could do.	Ariko nta byinshi yashoboraga gukora.
But he had seen nothing.	Ariko nta kintu yari yabonye.
She is a very beautiful child.	Ni umwana mwiza cyane.
That is clear.	Ibyo biragaragara.
That's right, that's right.	Nibyo, nibyo.
You can tell things.	Urashobora kumenya ibintu.
Now he was ready.	Ubu yari yiteguye.
Buying is human.	Kugura ni umuntu.
He meant.	Yashakaga kuvuga.
And when he wasn't around, he was.	Kandi igihe atari hafi, yari.
He thought it was wrong.	Yatekereje ko atari byo.
That was exactly what he needed.	Ibyo ni byo yari akeneye.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
In fact, most people don't.	Mubyukuri, abantu benshi ntabwo.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ukeneye kuba ibi gusa.
Did he just say that?	Yavuze gusa?
And you think a lot.	Kandi utekereza cyane.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Good time	Igihe cyiza.
I need to take this.	Nkeneye gufata ibi.
Applying was good.	Gusaba byari byiza.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
He was good at that.	Yari mwiza kuri ibyo.
It's something you have to live with.	Ni ikintu ugomba kubana.
He was not happy about that.	Ntabwo yishimiye ibyo.
They were not many.	Ntabwo bari benshi.
He did not ask why.	Ntabwo yabajije impamvu.
I have to hear things.	Ngomba kumva ibintu.
I want to work on everything.	Ndashaka gukora kuri byose.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And for me it was a wonderful experience.	Kandi kuri njye byari ibintu byiza cyane.
But nothing good.	Ariko nta cyiza.
This thing is big.	Iki kintu ni kinini.
This house is your home.	Iyi nzu ni inzu yawe.
But the thing is.	Ariko ikintu ni.
But you have to figure out how to do this.	Ariko ugomba kubona igitekerezo cyo gukora ibi.
Go back.	Gusubira inyuma.
You can have it.	Urashobora kugira.
That's it.	Uwo ni.
They had none.	Ntabwo bari bafite.
You're going to get what you want.	Ugiye kubona icyo ushaka.
The car didn't do it.	Imodoka ntabwo yabikoze.
You can only.	Urashobora gusa.
But it was too far.	Ariko byari kure cyane.
I guess one has to be.	Ndakeka ko umuntu agomba kuba.
Tell me, tell me.	Mbwira, mbwira.
That is his house.	Iyo ni inzu ye.
You never did that.	Nta kintu na kimwe wigeze ukora.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You can find out more about me here.	Urashobora kumenya byinshi kuri njye hano.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Inside.	Imbere.
He was then.	Icyo gihe yari.
We need advice.	Dukeneye inama.
In fact, many.	Mubyukuri, benshi.
I don't know who he was.	Sinzi uwo yari we.
Only wisdom.	Ubwenge gusa.
That's good.	Uwo ni mwiza.
That's not really what you need.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose ukeneye.
It is not good to eat.	Ntabwo ari byiza kurya.
Who knows people.	Ninde uzi abantu.
We have to do it quickly.	Tugomba kubikora vuba.
I am not a boy.	Ntabwo ndi umuhungu.
He never did anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yigeze agira icyo akora.
I'm on top.	Ndi hejuru yanjye.
They have tens of people.	Bafite abantu mirongo.
I needed time.	Nari nkeneye umwanya.
Something you have.	Ikintu ufite.
He said no one.	Yavuze ko nta muntu n'umwe.
I want to go.	Ndashaka kugenda.
But we have to look at my house now.	Ariko tugomba kureba inzu yanjye ubu.
I think he can.	Ndatekereza ko ashobora.
It was easy.	Byari ibintu byoroshye.
Well, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Nibyo, birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
I thought.	Ndatekereza.
After all, it would not be easy.	Byose kandi byose, ntabwo byari kuba byoroshye.
We are all scared.	Twese dufite ubwoba.
Everyone has a place.	Umuntu wese afite umwanya.
Anything to play at the time.	Ikintu cyose cyo gukina icyo gihe.
Absolutely not.	Rwose ntabwo aribyo.
He just wants to be that way.	Yifuza gusa ko aribyo.
And very likely.	Kandi birashoboka cyane.
I really have.	Mfite rwose.
I thought it was possible.	Natekereje ko bishoboka.
He never wanted to.	Ntiyigeze ashaka.
He did not want money.	Ntiyashakaga amafaranga.
At the time, he was not alone.	Icyo gihe, ntabwo yari wenyine.
There is fear.	Hariho ubwoba.
But he was not alone.	Ariko ntiyari wenyine.
He knew up and down.	Yari azi hejuru no hasi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He wanted to do things.	Yashakaga gukora ibintu.
I think of myself.	Ndatekereza kuri njye.
He was obviously as scared as he was.	Biragaragara ko yari afite ubwoba nka we.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I had the same problem.	Nari mfite ikibazo kimwe.
It was not far.	Ntiyari kure.
I am not.	Ntabwo ndi.
Everything and nothing.	Ibintu byose kandi ntacyo.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
We have a good question.	Dufite ikibazo cyiza.
However, today we are too many.	Ariko, uyu munsi turi benshi cyane.
There is something wrong with everything.	Hariho ikintu kibi kuri byose.
Wari.	Wari.
He didn't need that.	Ntabwo yari akeneye ibyo.
But obviously that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ariko biragaragara ko aricyo kintu cye.
But he also went.	Ariko na we yagiye.
I can't do that.	Ntabwo nshobora kubikora.
It worked out well.	Byagenze neza.
How about this.	Nigute ibi.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
He never thought of looking there.	Ntiyigeze atekereza kureba aho.
He could have done it easier.	Yashoboraga kubikora byoroshye.
He probably has his own problems.	Birashoboka ko afite ibibazo wenyine.
And it is my fault.	Kandi ni amakosa yanjye.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
But here it is.	Ariko hano hari inyuma.
He's been here.	Yamaze hano.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
He has it all.	Afite byose.
We have to do it again.	Tugomba kongera kubikora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka, yavuze amaherezo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Beautiful house.	Inzu nziza.
It didn't work out at all.	Ntabwo byagenze neza na gato.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Anything.	Ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
I was not sure what to do.	Sinari nzi neza icyo gukora.
Only.	Gusa.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It was true for me, as usual.	Byari ukuri kuri njye, nkuko bisanzwe.
He knew the baby was there.	Yari azi ko umwana yari ahari.
Not that he was bad.	Ntabwo ari uko yari mubi.
It's always something.	Buri gihe ni ikintu.
I wanted to do it for a long time.	Nashakaga kubikora igihe kirekire.
The truth is far away.	Ukuri ni kure cyane.
I am everything.	Ndi byose.
Something to watch.	Ikintu cyo kureba.
Someone.	Hari umuntu.
He needed to do something.	Yari akeneye kugira icyo akora.
And here we were.	Kandi hano twari.
Just an idea.	Igitekerezo gusa.
You need to know when to leave.	Ugomba kumenya igihe cyo kuva.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He has a son.	Afite umuhungu.
He wants a nice house.	Ashaka inzu nziza.
It didn't look bad.	Ntabwo yasaga nkaho ari mubi.
It is very likely that he will do so.	Birashoboka cyane ko azabikora.
It's not too early.	Ntabwo ari kare.
It’s a good thing to watch.	Ni ikintu cyiza cyo kureba.
He did the same thing on his own.	Yakoze ikintu kimwe wenyine.
That's what he said.	Ibyo ni byo yavuze.
This is too much.	Ibi ni byinshi cyane.
We have to listen.	Tugomba kumva.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It's the same with him.	Birasa na we.
He found time.	Yabonye umwanya.
But not everyone is.	Ariko buri wese ntabwo ari we.
Recently.	Vuba aha.
But there is a truth.	Ariko hariho ukuri.
You know how to do it.	Uzi kubikora.
The child can play.	Umwana arashobora gukina.
You have to be here now.	Ugomba kuba hano ubu.
You can drive safely.	Urashobora gutwara imodoka neza.
Very nice guy	Umusore mwiza cyane.
I'm glad he was there.	Nishimiye ko yari ahari.
We were nearby, nearby.	Twari hafi aho, hafi aho.
This one, please.	Uyu, nyamuneka.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa.
Good vision.	Kubona neza.
They always have.	Buri gihe bafite.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
He said something.	Hari icyo yavuze.
To have and to take.	Kugira no gufata.
And it was good for that.	Kandi byari byiza kuri ibyo.
Maybe a little.	Ahari gato.
The car said.	Imodoka yavuze.
Nothing less, that.	Nta kintu gito, ibyo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
This would be true.	Ibi byaba ari ukuri.
He didn't have to.	Ntabwo yagombaga.
I'm just being, really, really.	Gusa ndimo kuba, mubyukuri rwose mubyukuri.
It was not possible.	Ntabwo byari bishoboka.
You are a woman.	Uri umugore.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
He seemed to be on the ground.	Yasaga naho ari hasi.
You can't win.	Ntushobora gutsinda.
He thought he was doing well.	Yatekereje ko akora neza.
He came every day.	Yaje buri munsi.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ugomba kumenya gusa ko nawe ushobora.
I don't know who.	Sinzi uwo.
We don't even have to say.	Ntabwo tugomba no kuvuga.
He was one.	Yari umwe.
He told me he had a plan.	Yambwiye ko afite gahunda.
He was looking for something, or someone.	Yashakaga ikintu, cyangwa umuntu.
He is a good man.	Byose ni umuntu mwiza.
This is true of all.	Ibi ni ukuri kuri bose.
Very close to the view.	Hafi cyane hafi yo kureba.
You are young.	Wowe muto.
One must really do it.	Umuntu agomba rwose kubikora.
We have a lot to do today.	Dufite byinshi byo gukora uyu munsi.
In that he was almost certain to win.	Muri ibyo yari hafi gutsinda rwose.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
At the time, it was very easy.	Icyo gihe, byari byoroshye cyane.
For me, that was good.	Kuri njye, ibyo byari byiza.
I ask the same thing.	Ndabaza ikintu kimwe.
Not much to say.	Nta byinshi byo kuvuga.
I'm really glad you think.	Nishimiye rwose ko utekereza.
I like this one.	Nkunda iyi.
But it was up to both of them.	Ariko byari kuri bombi.
It's good, long time.	Ni mwiza, igihe kinini.
He said you have to read.	Yavuze ko ugomba gusoma.
This worked out well in a short time.	Ibi byagenze neza mugihe gito.
And well.	Kandi neza.
Everything went very well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza cyane.
I can say.	Nshobora kuvuga.
In fact, it was really good.	Mubyukuri, byari byiza rwose.
He was the only one.	Ibi yari we wenyine.
I did well.	Nakoze neza.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
Just work.	Akazi gusa.
It's good to be beautiful.	Nibyiza kuba mwiza.
He didn't tell me anything.	Ntacyo yambwiye.
That's not the case now.	Ntabwo aribyo ubu.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, nta cyo byari cyo.
Seize the opportunity.	Gufata amahirwe.
It was not good to be outside.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuba hanze.
No one to play today.	Nta muntu wo gukina uyu munsi.
Children have learning difficulties sometimes.	Abana bafite ikibazo cyo kwiga rimwe na rimwe.
You don't have to do this.	Ntugomba gukora ibi.
But, it was good.	Ariko, byari byiza.
My luck.	Amahirwe yanjye.
But he never felt younger.	Ariko ntiyigeze yumva ko ari muto.
He's gone now.	Yagiye ubu.
But this time, however, he did not have much luck.	Ariko iki gihe ariko, ntabwo yagize amahirwe menshi.
He was not happy about this.	Ntabwo yari yishimiye ibi.
He wasn't sure what to expect.	Ntabwo yari azi neza icyo ugomba gutegereza.
I should have done that.	Nari nkwiye kubikora.
It's good to be together.	Nibyiza kubana.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
You want to do things.	Urashaka gukora ibintu.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
And so on.	Kandi na byo.
Better than my car.	Byiza kuruta imodoka yanjye.
He found his clothes.	Yabonye imyenda ye.
They were there.	Bari aho bari.
The house is absolutely beautiful and absolutely home.	Inzu ni nziza rwose kandi rwose murugo.
He thought it was all right.	Yatekereje ko byagenze neza.
There is nothing to do.	Nta kintu na kimwe cyo gukora.
He said they were too many.	Yavuze ko bari benshi cyane.
I don't want to be here.	Sinshaka kuba hano.
That would be all.	Ibyo byaba aribyo byose.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
But everything else.	Ariko ikindi kintu cyose.
He was very young at the time.	Icyo gihe yari akiri muto cyane.
The car is very likely.	Imodoka birashoboka cyane.
It's not the same thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kimwe.
But there is one thing.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe.
I think you know we have to do this.	Ntekereza ko uzi ko tugomba gukora ibi.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I don't know what it is.	Ntabwo nzi icyo aricyo.
You need to get some advice.	Ugomba kubona inama.
You knew all the problems that were possible.	Wari uzi ibibazo byose bishoboka.
That's right.	Nukuri.
I want to do things.	Ndashaka gukora ibintu.
I really enjoyed the opportunity.	Nishimiye cyane amahirwe.
I want to live.	Ndashaka kubaho.
Phone charges may apply.	Amafaranga yo guhagarika terefone arashobora gusaba.
However, this is not likely to be the case.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo bishoboka ko aribyo.
Like the one above.	Nka kimwe hejuru.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
It was a lot now.	Byari byinshi ubu.
You can't stay here.	Ntushobora kuguma hano.
I mean what do you do.	Ndashaka kuvuga icyo ukora.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
He knew the same thing.	Yari azi ikintu kimwe.
It was a wonderful day.	Wari umunsi mwiza cyane.
Food would be good.	Ibiryo byaba byiza.
Good and good.	Byiza kandi byiza.
Today, he is happy that he chose the latter.	Uyu munsi, yishimiye ko yahisemo aba nyuma.
I was scared all day.	Nagize ubwoba umunsi wose.
I don't need anything.	Ntacyo nkeneye.
It feels great too !.	Yumva kandi mwiza cyane!.
He always wanted to tell me what to do.	Buri gihe yashakaga kumbwira icyo gukora.
Great idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza cyane.
I work here.	Nkora hano.
In fact, it is.	Mubyukuri, nibyo.
I know what it is.	Nzi icyo aricyo.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
However, this is not very good.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
No one has friends here.	Nta muntu ufite inshuti hano.
That's what he had to do.	Icyo ni cyo yagombaga gukora.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
This is true.	Ibi ni ukuri.
Well, at least they didn't go down without explaining themselves first.	Nibyiza, bari hafi.
Money is nothing.	Amafaranga nta kintu.
It was not a big deal.	Ntabwo byari ikibazo kinini.
But you can't take chances.	Ariko ntushobora gufata amahirwe.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Urimo kubikora gusa bigoye.
I had a job.	Nari mfite akazi.
Time to see.	Igihe cyo kubona.
I really think he was.	Ndatekereza rwose ko yari.
It will be.	Bizaba.
He is the only one.	Ni umuntu wese wenyine.
He loves simple things.	Akunda ibintu byoroshye.
This is good for me.	Ibi ni byiza kuri njye.
Friends are right.	Inshuti nibyo.
I want to drive today.	Ndashaka gutwara uyu munsi.
They are just people.	Ni abantu gusa.
They wouldn't do this.	Ntabwo bari gukora ibi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko agomba kuba.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I'm scared to go.	Mfite ubwoba bwo kugenda.
That is normal.	Iyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
That's not what you want.	Ntabwo ari ikintu ushaka.
I need my clothes.	Nkeneye imyenda yanjye.
This was very easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye cyane.
We are all here to make money.	Twese turi hano gushaka amafaranga.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
But he seemed to be fine.	Ariko yasaga nkaho ari byiza.
All together	Bose hamwe.
We were at school together.	Twari ku ishuri hamwe.

You can do whatever you want.	Urashobora gukora icyo ushaka cyose.
You saw nothing.	Ntacyo wabonye.
He says success.	Avuga ko gutsinda.
You want	Urashaka.
But you can’t win time.	Ariko ntushobora gutsinda umwanya.
I know a lot about it.	Nzi byinshi kuri byo.
I have a son.	Mfite umuhungu.
And he came in a bad time.	Kandi yaje mugihe kibi.
You have too.	Nawe ufite.
Something his father was very happy about.	Ikintu se yishimiye cyane.
He needs to know now.	Agomba kumenya ubu.
She loves the outdoors.	Akunda hanze.
It is very good and simple.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byoroshye.
I am at the moment.	Ndi kuri ubu.
He thought he could get going.	Yatekereje ko ashobora kubona kugenda.
I can't read anything here.	Ntacyo nshobora gusoma hano.
I'm sure nothing.	Nzi neza ko ntacyo.
But he chose to play.	Ariko yahisemo gukina.
Who knows what.	Ninde uzi icyo.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
I have heard many people say that.	Numvise abantu benshi ko.
I'm sure you can do it.	Nzi neza ko ushobora kubikora.
We are friends.	Turi inshuti.
'	'
It’s a matter of hearing and trying.	Ni ikibazo cyo kumva no kugerageza.
But for everyone.	Ariko kuri buri wese.
.	.
He wanted to.	Yashakaga.
He now has both.	Ubu afite bombi.
He did not know for sure.	Ntabwo yari azi neza.
If so, it didn't last long.	Niba aribyo, ntabwo yamaze igihe kinini.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I didn’t want to live like him.	Sinifuzaga kubaho nka we.
Or phone.	Cyangwa terefone.
The way they are together, you mean.	Uburyo bari hamwe, urashaka kuvuga.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
I think so.	Ntekereza cyane.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
Later, maybe, later.	Nyuma, birashoboka, nyuma.
In the short term, only in the short term is good.	Mugihe gito, gusa mugihe gito nibyiza.
But he knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ariko yari azi ko bishoboka.
He has to play.	Agomba gukina.
But that would be a mistake.	Ariko ibi byaba ari amakosa.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
But you are my daughter.	Ariko uri umukobwa wanjye.
No problem.	Nta kibazo na kimwe.
I don't know what happened.	Ntabwo nzi uko byagenze.
It's a good day.	Ni umunsi mwiza.
We need to know something.	Tugomba kumenya ikintu.
He chose to take action.	Yahisemo kugira icyo akora.
I saw fear in him.	Nabonye ubwoba muri we.
I knew nothing about it.	Ntacyo nari nzi kuri ibyo byose.
That is us.	Uwo ni twe.
I think people are scared.	Ntekereza ko abantu bafite ubwoba.
To him.	Kugeza kuri we.
I didn't think it would be easy.	Sinatekerezaga ko byari kuba byoroshye.
Since then, we have only made mistakes.	Kuva icyo gihe, twari dufite amakosa gusa.
What is he going to do.	Ni iki agiye gukora.
It's clear.	Biragaragara neza.
She is very happy with this.	Yishimiye cyane ibi.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
You can't stay here.	Ntushobora kuguma hano.
Whatever it is, it would be.	Ibyo aribyo byose, byaba.
Being on it for a while.	Kuba kuri yo igihe gito.
He wasn't sure if he could drive.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko ashobora gutwara.
He had time to think.	Yari afite umwanya wo gutekereza.
He used to help people.	Yakundaga gufasha abantu.
It was good to help people.	Byari byiza gufasha abantu.
He even wanted to be one.	Yashakaga mbere kuba umwe.
It's the same with you.	Ni kimwe nawe.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
I'm not happy.	Ntabwo nishimiye.
I have a problem with doing well.	Mfite ikibazo cyo gukora neza.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
At all times, and he would be scared.	Igihe cyose, kandi yari kuba afite ubwoba.
I was happy in front of him.	Nishimiye imbere ye.
Something you are.	Ikintu uri.
Here is the truth.	Hano hari ukuri.
You can do it at home.	Urashobora kubikora murugo.
You can eat on the floor.	Urashobora kurya hasi.
I never did.	Ntabwo nigeze nkora.
He wants more.	Ashaka byinshi.
He knew he had to have it.	Yari azi ko agomba kugira.
You didn't get the money.	Ntabwo wabonye amafaranga.
'	'
He thought he was a teacher.	Yatekereje ko yari umwarimu.
They had nothing for him.	Nta kintu na kimwe bari bafite kuri we.
You never loved someone.	Ntabwo wigeze ukunda umuntu.
Not really good, but he tried.	Ntabwo ari byiza rwose, ariko yagerageje.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kuri ibyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyo nibyo byiza cyane.
That's too young.	Ibyo ni muto cyane.
Tonight, no.	Iri joro, sibyo.
But the boy needs his father.	Ariko umuhungu akeneye se.
It's your day.	Ni umunsi wawe.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He was younger than me.	Yari muto kundusha.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
He wanted to eat.	Yashakaga kurya.
It would be too much.	Byaba ari byinshi cyane.
That's all we have to do.	Ibyo aribyo byose tugomba gukora.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
I have to go with you.	Ngomba kujyana nawe.
However, we have this problem.	Ariko, dufite iki kibazo.
Book, wisdom.	Igitabo, ubwenge.
He did not ask for anything.	Nta cyo yasabye.
He wanted to know where he was.	Yashakaga kumenya aho ari.
It's too young.	Ndi muto.
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.
No problem so far.	Nta kibazo na kimwe kugeza ubu.
He meant something.	Yashakaga kuvuga ikintu.
He is always close.	Ahora hafi.
I am currently in a meeting.	Ubu ndi mu nama.
I don't think so.	Ntacyo ntekereza.
She was ready to go home.	Yari yiteguye gutaha.
I didn’t want to think again.	Sinifuzaga kongera gutekereza.
He thought it was.	Yibwiraga ko aribyo.
This is great.	Ibi ni byiza cyane.
She is probably alone.	Birashoboka ko ari wenyine.
One could hear his point.	Umuntu yashoboraga kumva igitekerezo cye.
That, or he was very good at doing it.	Ibyo, cyangwa yari umuhanga cyane kubikora.
The man was very worried.	Uwo yari afite impungenge cyane.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
Not enough.	Ntabwo bihagije.
He has that.	Afite ibyo.
We have to talk here.	Tugomba kuvugana hano.
But it has been a long time coming.	Ariko yamaze igihe kinini cyane.
I was the only woman.	Nari umugore wenyine.
Like me	Nkanjye.
High position.	Umwanya wo hejuru.
We had a good movie.	Twari dufite firime nziza.
To see	Kubona.
He was right.	Yavuze ukuri.
You have to be honest.	Ugomba kuba ukuri.
Nothing in this world.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri iyi si.
It's an opportunity.	Ni amahirwe.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
He thinks so.	Yibwira ko aribyo.
But being friends was good, if not good.	Ariko kuba inshuti byari byiza, niba atari byiza.
And until then, no reason.	Kandi kugeza icyo gihe, nta mpamvu.
For him there is no reason.	Kuri we nta mpamvu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kibazo.
I'm not really sure what happened.	Ntabwo rwose nzi neza uko byagenze.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari ibintu bisanzwe.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
If you have.	Niba ufite.
He knew what he was going to get.	Yari azi icyo yari kubona.
Everything.	Byose.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza cyane kubikora.
The worst thing that happened was he went into the house.	Ikintu kibi cyane yagiye mu nzu.
I love the truth.	Nkunda ukuri.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
John doesn't know why.	Yohana ntazi impamvu.
It is a family.	Ni umuryango.
Stop giving up.	Reka kureka.
She is not a woman.	Ntabwo ari umugore.
No one knew how to do it.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi kubikora.
And that's right.	Kandi uko ni ukuri.
Time is short.	Igihe ni gito.
I saw something.	Nabonye ikintu.
It started at the top.	Yatangiye hejuru.
Good stuff, good stuff.	Ibintu byiza, byiza.
Not really, really.	Ntabwo ari rwose, mubyukuri.
The girl becomes a guy.	Umukobwa aba umusore.
We need to stay friends.	Tugomba kuguma inshuti.
But he seemed very happy.	Ariko yasaga naho yishimiye cyane.
You can do it.	Urashobora kubikora.
This is not enough.	Ibi ntabwo bihagije.
But he wanted children.	Ariko yashakaga abana.
That's good, this one.	Ni mwiza, uyu.
That's not normal.	Ntabwo aribyo bisanzwe.
I hope you can do it.	Ndizera ko ushobora kubikora.
Shame on everyone.	Isoni kuri bose.
She felt dressed up right now.	Yumvise yambaye kuri ubu.
Have a nice day.	Waba umunsi mwiza.
We were eating.	Twari kurya.
I think a lot of people were.	Ntekereza ko abantu benshi bari.
This house is gone.	Iyi nzu yagiye.
And how he has to do things right.	Kandi nigute agomba gukora ibintu neza.
We have the truth.	Dufite ukuri.
Here's your phone.	Hano hari terefone yawe.
I really wanted to.	Nashakaga cyane.
Almost everything went smoothly.	Hafi ya byose byagenze byoroshye.
But, in reality.	Ariko, mubyukuri.
This one was close.	Uyu yari hafi.
Too far.	Kure cyane.
Everyone always wants more.	Umuntu wese ahora ashaka byinshi.
You know it is.	Uzi ko ari.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
That's probably not what you mean.	Ibyo birashoboka ko atari byo ushaka kuvuga.
You are very here.	Wowe hano cyane.
I feel backwards.	Numva ndi inyuma.
It works well.	Akora neza.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
I don't think so.	Ndatekereza ko atari kubikora.
If not, most people would.	Niba atari byo, abantu benshi bari kubikora.
He was his father.	Yari se.
They were not money.	Ntabwo bari amafaranga.
At that time I did not know.	Icyo gihe sinari nzi.
He needs to step back.	Akeneye gusubira inyuma.
I can talk to you.	Nshobora kuvugana nawe.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
.	.
He didn't have to look far.	Ntabwo yagombaga kureba kure.
Just an idea !.	Igitekerezo gusa!.
That was easy enough.	Ibyo byari byoroshye bihagije.
I guess no one did.	Ndakeka ko nta muntu wabikoze.
I don't know why.	Sinzi impamvu.
It was easy.	Byari ibintu byoroshye.
It didn't happen that way.	Ntabwo byagenze gutya.
Beautiful girl	Umukobwa mwiza.
soon! 	vuba!
He had no tomorrow.	Ntabwo yari afite ejo.
There is something.	Hariho ikintu.
I don't know the time.	Sinzi umwanya.
He has no good.	Nta byiza byiza afite.
It was good enough.	Byari byiza bihagije.
I only have one problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe gusa.
I am the only one	Ninjye wenyine.
Eventually, it didn't come at all.	Amaherezo, ntabwo yaje na gato.
I want to do something else.	Ndashaka gukora ikindi kintu.
As usual.	Nkuko bisanzwe.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
The family is very active.	Umuryango ukora cyane.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
It was not good for me.	Ntabwo byari byiza kuri njye.
Obviously that was not what I wanted.	Biragaragara ko ibyo atari byo nashakaga.
He looked.	Yarebye.
I just thought we were in this together.	Gusa natekereje ko turi muri ibi hamwe.
Only.	Gusa.
I thought we were lucky.	Natekereje ko dufite amahirwe.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
And he could see nothing.	Kandi nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kubona.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I have no one.	Nta muntu mfite.
It was not something he could help.	Ntabwo yari ikintu yashoboraga gufasha.
That, many people.	Ibyo, ni abantu benshi.
I'm doing something.	Ndimo gukora ikintu.
The bigger the problem, the better.	Ikibazo kinini, nibyiza.
He had heard nothing.	Nta kintu yari yumvise.
He did nothing of the sort.	Nta kintu na kimwe muri ibyo yakoze.
This is not possible.	Ibi ntabwo bishoboka.
I'm sure that.	Nzi neza ko.
Do you know how?	Uzi uko?.
Life chances.	Amahirwe yo kubaho.
He never thought his luck would be a problem.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ko amahirwe ye yaba ikibazo.
And not far away.	Kandi ntabwo ari kure.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Byiza cyane kurenza umugore mbere.
That is the problem.	Icyo ni ikibazo.
They were outside.	Bari hanze.
So many things.	Ibintu byinshi cyane.
Or for me.	Cyangwa kuri njye.
You are looking for a job.	Urashaka akazi.
You are not bad.	Ntabwo uri mubi.
I got the idea.	Nabonye igitekerezo.
There is a family.	Hariho umuryango.
He could do nothing.	Ntacyo yashoboraga gukora.
He never felt up or down.	Ntiyigeze yumva hejuru cyangwa hasi.
He also loved being away.	Yakundaga kandi kuba kure.
He was nearby.	Yari hafi aho.
That's all you need.	Ibyo aribyo ukeneye.
It's great here.	Nibyiza cyane hano.
Not too bad.	Ntabwo ari mubi cyane.
The problem is, where.	Ikibazo ni, he.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
He must be present.	Agomba kuba ahari.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
That's not what you think.	Ntabwo aribyo utekereza.
I do nothing.	Ntacyo nkora.
I guess this is it.	Ndakeka ko ibi.
This is a much bigger thing than, well, anything.	Iki kintu kinini cyane kuruta, neza, ikintu cyose.
He did not know for sure.	Ntabwo yari azi neza.
He would say nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari kuvuga.
But this is not wise.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ubwenge.
It was a car.	Yari imodoka.
He goes outside.	Agiye hanze.
You are my wife.	Uri umugore wanjye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari se rwose.
The chances are far.	Amahirwe ni kure.
For me.	Kuri njye.
I think one has to look carefully.	Ntekereza ko umuntu agomba kureba neza.
I want to study this issue.	Ndashaka kwiga iki kibazo.
This is very likely.	Ibi birashoboka cyane.
I want a baby.	Ndashaka umwana.
He took the first car.	Yafashe imodoka ya mbere.
It was close.	Byari hafi.
In the end, it would be better.	Amaherezo, byaba byiza.
He needed to go.	Yari akeneye kugenda.
You can't say what it is.	Ntushobora kuvuga icyo aricyo.
But it is definitely possible.	Ariko birashoboka rwose.
I'm sure you've seen this.	Nzi neza ko wabonye ibi.
Yes, it is possible.	Nibyo, birashoboka.
Not before, not now, never.	Ntabwo mbere, si ubu, nta na rimwe.
This is you.	Uyu niwowe.
Not on your phone.	Ntabwo ari kuri terefone yawe.
However, it was probably good.	Ariko, birashoboka ko byari byiza.
All this.	Ibi byose.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I never heard of that.	Sinigeze numva ibyo.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
But there is one thing.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe.
And that's exactly what he had to do.	Kandi nibyo yagombaga gukora.
She was a beautiful girl.	Yari umukobwa mwiza.
Only.	Gusa.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
It wasn’t everything, but it was something.	Ntabwo byari byose, ariko byari ikintu.
The one most wanted.	Uwo benshi yashakaga.
I never saw him go so fast.	Sinigeze mbona agenda vuba.
The space we have is beautiful and very possible.	Umwanya dufite ni mwiza kandi birashoboka cyane.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo cyane.
One thing or another.	Ikintu kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
I'm not sure why.	Ntabwo nzi neza impamvu.
You think he is.	Uratekereza ko ari we.
Lots of opportunities to be together.	Amahirwe menshi kubana.
I don't want to do it tonight.	Sinshaka gukora iri joro.
He never thought.	Ntiyigeze atekereza.
He did not want to stay where he was.	Ntiyashakaga kuguma aho yari ari.
Something for everyone, really.	Ikintu kuri buri wese, mubyukuri.
I want to do it.	Ndashaka kubikora.
I don't want anything.	Sinshaka ikintu na kimwe.
I heard something.	Numvise ikintu.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I want to say goodbye.	Ndashaka kuvuga neza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
I think we can.	Ntekereza ko dushobora.
But it is very beautiful.	Ariko ni mwiza cyane.
I can help children.	Nshobora gufasha abana.
Maybe do something in it one day.	Ahari gukora ikintu muri cyo umunsi umwe.
I'm out.	Ndi hanze.
Going back was a lot.	Gusubira inyuma byari byinshi.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
But it was too much.	Ariko byari byinshi cyane.
But he had the money.	Ariko yari afite amafaranga.
Nothing to say.	Nta kintu cyo kuvuga.
But the boy was right.	Ariko umuhungu yari afite ukuri.
I want to hear it again.	Ndashaka kongera kumva bisanzwe.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza yari yizeye.
But he never felt better.	Ariko ntiyigeze yumva neza.
He is obviously right.	Biragaragara ko afite ukuri.
I heard that.	Numvise uwo.
He had not gone far.	Ntabwo yari yagiye kure.
It's a good job.	Ni akazi neza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyo, yari azi neza ko yabikoze ubu.
Maybe just take the bus.	Ahari gufata bisi gusa.
He did it before.	Yabikoze mbere.
He worked for a long time.	Yakoze igihe kirekire.
I didn’t have many plans.	Ntabwo nari mfite gahunda nyinshi.
You have to believe.	Ugomba kwizera.
Most of the time, that is a really good plan.	Igihe kinini, iyo ni gahunda nziza rwose.
More than anything else.	Kurenza ikindi kintu cyose.
One thing.	Ikintu kimwe.
I want to play well with you.	Ndashaka gukina neza nawe.
He would not go.	Ntabwo yari kugenda.
That's not easy.	Ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
He thought it was his fault.	Yatekereje ko ari amakosa ye.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I want to read a dog.	Ndashaka gusoma imbwa.
We can't take a lot of people.	Ntidushobora gufata abantu benshi.
Take time.	Gufata umwanya.
So far, no problem.	Kugeza ubu, nta kibazo.
Maybe.	Yaba ahari.
You can't do this.	Ntushobora gukora ibi.
Or he thought he did.	Cyangwa yatekereje ko yabikoze.
Not at the moment.	Ntabwo ari muri iki gihe.
He started a family.	Yatangiye umuryango.
But you have to know exactly what you are doing.	Ariko ugomba kumenya neza icyo ukora.
That is a bad person.	Uwo ni umuntu mubi.
You really have an opinion on that.	Mubyukuri ufite igitekerezo kuri byo.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byaba byiza.
Or not alone.	Cyangwa ntabwo ari wenyine.
No one was around.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari hafi ye.
He is very close.	Ari hafi cyane.
But you can.	Ariko urashobora.
It was great to watch.	Byari byiza kureba.
I just hope not too many.	Gusa nizere ko atari benshi cyane.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi muri byo.
He would not be alone.	Ntabwo yari kuba wenyine.
And this would be true.	Kandi ibi byaba ari ukuri.
Good plan.	Gahunda nziza.
It is not very far.	Ntabwo ari kure cyane.
For him, it is possible.	Kuri we, birashoboka.
I wanted to talk to him.	Nashakaga kuvugana na we.
Ninde.	Ninde.
Good.	Nziza.
He tried many things.	Yagerageje ibintu byinshi.
The human mind is simple.	Ubwenge bwa muntu ni ibintu byoroshye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari ubwoba gusa bwo kureba.
It seems easy to me.	Birasa naho byoroshye kuri njye.
Not really one.	Mubyukuri ntabwo ari umwe.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
I think it's good.	Ndakeka ko ari byiza.
You can see your end.	Urashobora kubona amaherezo yawe.
No one said anything.	Nta muntu wavuze ikintu.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
This is obviously not good.	Ibi biragaragara ko atari byiza.
It's not long.	Ntabwo ari igihe kinini.
I'm going to play this thing up.	Ngiye gukina iki kintu hejuru.
I didn't want to leave his room.	Sinifuzaga kuva mu cyumba cye.
He had no wife or issue.	Ntiyari afite umugore cyangwa ikibazo.
We were close enough.	Twari hafi bihagije.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It is true and it is true.	Ni ukuri kandi ni ukuri.
That's right, man.	Nibyo, muntu.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
You can't go forward, you can't go back.	Ntushobora kujya imbere, ntushobora gusubira inyuma.
It is in us.	Ni muri twe.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I was not here.	Ntabwo nari hano.
He wants advice.	Arashaka inama.
Only.	Gusa.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
He wanted faith.	Yashakaga kwizera.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Ntacyo byari kuri yo.
Or maybe it's not him.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari we.
Close, but not right.	Hafi, ariko sibyo.
There is.	Hariho.
That's a good thing.	Ibyo ni ibintu byiza.
I have a lot of luck.	Mfite amahirwe menshi.
I think it's the same with you.	Ntekereza ko ari kimwe nawe.
I don't have much.	Ntabwo mfite byinshi.
There is so much here.	Hano hari byinshi cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
I wish you luck.	Ndashaka amahirwe.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
'he said.	' yavuze.
Anyone, is close.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese, ari hafi.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
After all.	Nyuma ya byose.
Someone who makes a movie.	Umuntu ukora firime.
I needed to do it.	Nari nkeneye kubikora.
I think that's the problem.	Ntekereza ko aricyo kibazo.
But of course it is possible.	Ariko rwose birashoboka.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
All day, all day.	Umunsi wose, umunsi wose.
It was down and out.	Byari hasi kandi hanze.
Bad speech.	Kuvuga nabi umuntu.
This is normal.	Ubu ni ibintu bisanzwe.
Me too.	Nanjye.
Sunday was my day of experimentation.	Ku cyumweru wari umunsi wanjye wo kugerageza.
He is not in this world.	Ntabwo ari kuri iyi si.
That's why.	Ni yo mpamvu.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
We had no idea.	Ntabwo twari dufite igitekerezo.
And here he was.	Kandi hano yari.
Or maybe he did.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko yabikoze.
You can come up.	Urashobora kuza hejuru.
I don’t want to say any of that.	Ntabwo nshaka kuvuga kimwe muri byo.
You love your car.	Ukunda imodoka yawe.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
It is also my fault.	Nanjye ni amakosa yanjye.
And they are many.	Kandi ari benshi.
I feel good about myself.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
We have to do it right.	Tugomba gukora neza.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
They knew he could swim.	Bari bazi ko ashobora koga.
Many have a lot.	Benshi bafite byinshi.
I'm playing well.	Ndimo gukina neza.
You saw it for the first time.	Wabonye bwa mbere.
I feel human.	Ndumva umuntu.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
Being above all else and everyone.	Kuba iri hejuru ya byose na buri wese.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
He doesn't need to work again.	Ntabwo akeneye kongera gukora.
You are smart.	Ufite ubwenge.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Ibyo birashoboka cyane ko atari ukuri kuruta ukuri.
Especially on the inside.	Cyane cyane imbere.
He was there.	Yari ahari.
I had.	Nari mfite.
That's what you can hear.	Nibyo ushobora kumva.
I think they would be here.	Ndatekereza ko bari kuba hano.
You have to come well.	Ugomba kuza neza.
I have a lot for him.	Mfite byinshi kuri we.
He didn't have time to do it.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo kubikora.
But there is someone.	Ariko hari umuntu.
And that was good for him.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza kuri we.
Her son left that day.	Uwo munsi umuhungu we yagiye.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
But he went.	Ariko yagiye.
That's right, that's all.	Nibyo, nibyo byose.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
Just once.	Rimwe gusa.
I mean, you.	Ndashaka kuvuga, wowe.
That's normal.	Ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe.
He looked first.	Yarebye mbere.
He had to stop thinking.	Yagombaga guhagarika gutekereza.
To do so.	Kubikora.
It's the same with him.	Birasa na we.
We have too.	Natwe dufite.
To me that sounds very similar.	Kuri njye ibyo birasa cyane.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki?.
Learn more.	Kumenya byinshi.
I see, that is not the case.	Njye mbona, ntabwo aribyo.
The day his friend was out.	Umunsi inshuti ye yari hanze.
But he knew in that look that he had failed.	Ariko yari azi ko atari byo.
But he was good.	Ariko yari mwiza.
There is something positive about him.	Hariho ikintu cyiza kuri we.
I don’t know about any of that.	Ntabwo nzi kuri kimwe muri ibyo.
He has a lot to do.	Afite byinshi byo gukora.
Definitely worth a try, though.	Ugomba rwose kugerageza, ariko.
And he had.	Kandi yari afite.
There is.	Hariho.
But he has something.	Ariko afite ikintu.
No one needed it.	Nta muntu yari akeneye.
You are an expert.	Uri umuhanga.
But it is not easy.	Ariko ntabwo byoroshye.
I am not an expert.	Ntabwo ndi umuhanga.
He is an expert.	Ni umuhanga.
It's always the same.	Buri gihe ni kimwe.
The truth is not good for us.	Ukuri ntabwo ari byiza kuri twe.
I saw a problem.	Nabonye ikibazo.
Everyone should be.	Umuntu wese agomba kuba.
I am scared and a little skeptical.	Mfite ubwoba kandi ndashidikanya gato.
This is not the case.	Ibi ntabwo aribyo.
You can say whatever you want to me.	Urashobora kuvuga icyo ushaka cyose kuri njye.
You saw nothing.	Ntacyo wabonye.
You can't think of one.	Ntushobora gutekereza kuri kimwe.
Until he was here.	Kugeza aho yari hano.
There is one problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I'm all for him.	Ndi byose kuri we.
He needs to go.	Akeneye kugenda.
He made new friends.	Yabonye inshuti nshya.
Errors! 	Amakosa!
He did not go to school.	Ntabwo yagiye ku ishuri.
He didn't know how to talk to you.	Ntiyari azi kuvugana nawe.
He had no idea how to do it.	Ntabwo yari afite igitekerezo cyo kubikora.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
You have to think for yourself.	Ufite wenyine wenyine gutekereza.
He has a good dog.	Afite imbwa nziza.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni cyo kibazo rwose.
I like to go back.	Nkunda gusubira inyuma.
You can do a lot.	Urashobora gukora byinshi.
I'm bad.	Ndi mubi.
He knew what it was.	Yari azi icyo ari cyo.
.	.
The one inside.	Uwo uri imbere.
I worked hard to do this.	Nakoze cyane kugira iki.
You can have friends.	Urashobora kugira inshuti.
He feels nothing.	Ntacyo yumva.
I mean he has nothing wrong.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko nta kibi afite.
But it happened.	Ariko byagenze.
There is a lot to learn here.	Hano hari byinshi byo kwiga.
Maybe we should look into the distance.	Ahari tugomba kureba kure.
That's the job.	Nibyo akazi.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba ndi hano.
I thought about it a lot.	Natekereje kuri byinshi.
It’s not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari amahirwe menshi.
He should have known better.	Yari akwiye kumenya neza.
You can have everything.	Urashobora kugira byose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
One should not look at anything.	Umuntu ntagomba kureba ikintu na kimwe.
Very much today.	Muri iki gihe cyane.
It would be nice for me.	Byaba byiza kuri njye.
He had not been alone for a long time.	Ntabwo yari amaze igihe kinini ari umwe.
It's great to watch.	Nibyiza cyane kureba.
I do not see.	Ntabwo mbona.
He is not an expert.	Ntabwo ari umuhanga.
I know my mistakes.	Nzi amakosa yanjye.
He is young but he can play.	Ni muto ariko arashobora gukina.
She thinks more of herself than her son.	Yibwira wenyine kuruta umuhungu we.
Na se.	Na se.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
That's right.	Nibyo.
It would not be close.	Ntabwo byari kuba hafi.
We are not too far away either.	Ntabwo natwe turi kure cyane.
I can't.	Ntashobora.
Obviously, not many.	Biragaragara, ntabwo ari benshi.
This looks really good, and it looks great.	Ibi birasa rwose, nibyiza rwose.
It wasn’t much to do but it was easy.	Ntabwo byari byinshi byo gukora ariko byoroshye.
Do you have a plan?	Ufite gahunda?
I want to leave here.	Ndashaka kuva hano.
I should have done better.	Nari nkwiye gukora neza.
It was true.	Byari kuri.
Going.	Kujya.
There is no one in that.	Nta muntu n'umwe uri muri ibyo.
He is playing with you.	Arimo gukina nawe.
And that was good.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza.
He may have his own plan.	Ashobora kugira gahunda ye.
He is my friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye.
I am very happy with this.	Nishimiye cyane ibi.
I even realized that at the time.	Nigeze no kubona ko icyo gihe.
It was really nice to see.	Byari byiza rwose kubona.
But there is another problem.	Ariko hariho ikindi kibazo kimwe.
I always see something in that.	Buri gihe mbona ikintu muri ibyo.
You are reading poorly.	Urimo gusoma nabi.
The food he made.	Ibiryo yakoze.
There is something else.	Hariho ikindi kintu.
This, however, is not the case here.	Ibi ariko, ntabwo aribyo hano.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
Almost always.	Hafi buri gihe.
I really don't see anything.	Ntabwo rwose mbona ikintu.
But there is one thing you need to know.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe ugomba kumenya.
But he was nothing to me.	Ariko ntacyo yari kuri njye.
It's not a job.	Ntabwo ari akazi.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
They were both mentally retarded.	Bombi nta ubwenge bari bafite.
Honestly, he was right.	Nyamuneka, yari afite ukuri.
They both have the truth.	Bombi bafite ukuri.
We are close, we are really close.	Turi hafi, rwose turi hafi.
You should not eat on that day.	Ntagomba kugira ibyo kurya kuri uwo munsi.
But you are not alone.	Ariko ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
In that beautiful house.	Muri iyo nzu nziza.
They always had a lot.	Buri gihe bari bafite byinshi.
Great thing.	Ikintu kinini.
But he had none.	Ariko nta na kimwe yari afite.
We have to listen.	Tugomba kumva.
This will not be good.	Ibi ntabwo bizaba byiza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Out here you have something to say.	Hanze hano hari icyo ushaka kuvuga.
I think there is something to see here.	Ntekereza ko hano hari ikintu cyo kubona.
Luckily for that.	Amahirwe kuri ibyo.
It wasn’t much to see.	Ntabwo byari byinshi byo kubona.
The boy was also present.	Umuhungu na we yari ahari.
You don't need to be scared either.	Nanjye ntabwo ukeneye ubwoba.
They were good friends.	Bari inshuti nziza.
I know you need your time.	Nzi ko ukeneye umwanya wawe.
I never found it difficult.	Sinigeze mbona ko bigoye.
He wanted to look ahead.	Yashakaga kureba imbere.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
I was scared to look.	Nagize ubwoba bwo kureba.
You need luck.	Ukeneye amahirwe.
I didn't want to do that.	Sinifuzaga kubikora.
Everything was normal.	Byose byari bisanzwe.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
One person can.	Umuntu umwe arashobora.
Both were here.	Hano bombi bari.
It was a great plan.	Byari gahunda nziza.
Sometimes, this is a simple matter.	Rimwe na rimwe, ibi ni ibintu byoroshye.
None of us like movies.	Nta n'umwe muri twe ukunda firime.
Just wait.	Gutegereza gusa.
I want you to be near me.	Ndashaka ko uri hafi yanjye.
Just one more thing to try.	Gusa ikindi kintu kimwe cyo kugerageza.
There is something here.	Hano hari ikintu.
The one who went.	Uwo yagiye.
You do what you want.	Ukora icyo ushaka.
Trying and finding the truth.	Kugerageza no gushaka ukuri.
I can't go again.	Sinshobora kongera kugenda.
It was very nice and nice.	Byari byiza cyane kandi byiza.
It will be very easy.	Bizaba ibintu byoroshye cyane.
It's just a home.	Ni murugo gusa.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
Just one question.	Ikibazo kimwe gusa.
He doesn't need it now.	Ntabwo akeneye ubu.
I'm not doing that.	Ntabwo ndimo kubikora.
That's possible.	Nibyo birashoboka.
No one knew what to do.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi icyo gukora.
They probably knew my family.	Birashoboka ko bari bazi umuryango wanjye.
He could eat anything he wanted.	Yashoboraga kurya ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose yashakaga.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's just a chance to be together.	Ni amahirwe gusa kubana.
But he is only one person.	Ariko ni umuntu umwe gusa.
I have a baby here.	Mfite umwana hano.
And nothing.	Kuba kandi ntacyo.
It's an opportunity.	Ni amahirwe.
I had nothing.	Nta na kimwe nari mfite.
It wouldn't have happened.	Ntabwo byari kuba.
Things were normal.	Ibintu byari bisanzwe.
He looked closely.	Yarebye hafi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Yari azi ko ibyo atari ukuri.
We have to go back.	Tugomba gusubira inyuma.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I like to eat and live well.	Nkunda kurya no kubana neza.
I know the advice.	Nzi inama.
That's right- this is me.	Nibyo, ni njye.
They were not far away.	Ntabwo bari kure.
You can do everything right.	Urashobora gukora byose neza.
I think he was still my wife.	Ntekereza ko yari akiri umugore wanjye.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
And you really can't find something good.	Kandi rwose ntushobora kubona ikintu cyiza.
What he can do.	Icyo ashobora.
You love money but not work.	Ukunda amafaranga ariko ntabwo ari akazi.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
It's just a family.	Ni umuryango gusa.
It is not a house.	Ntabwo ari inzu.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza.
But he was still here, so good.	Ariko yari akiri hano, ni byiza.
For the first time.	Bwa mbere.
That's easy.	Nibyo byoroshye.
It was a good thing.	Byari ibintu byiza.
You can't think of anything else.	Ntushobora gutekereza ikindi kintu cyose.
We can't look back.	Ntidushobora kureba inyuma.
He loved it more than ever.	Yakundaga cyane kuruta uko byari bisanzwe.
I was never able to walk.	Ntabwo nigeze nshobora kugenda.
I'm really sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe rwose no gutegereza.
You have to tell.	Ugomba kubwira.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He told me what would happen.	Yambwiye uko bizaba.
Doing more, working harder, and waiting for my chance.	Gukora byinshi, gukora cyane, no gutegereza amahirwe yanjye.
That was normal.	Ibyo byari bisanzwe.
But you can go very far.	Ariko urashobora kujya kure cyane.
I don’t have time to think.	Ntabwo mfite umwanya wo gutekereza.
He just said.	Yavuze gusa.
But this is not true.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
He wanted to do it at the time.	Yashakaga kubikora icyo gihe.
At the meeting, he was.	Mu nama, yari.
And that was great.	Kandi ibyo byari byiza cyane.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
Probably thirty years.	Ahari imyaka mirongo itatu.
I have a little problem here.	Mfite ikibazo gito hano.
I don't know what to do.	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora na gato.
I felt ashamed.	Numvise mfite isoni.
They don't know when.	Ntabwo bazi igihe.
Or outside of me.	Cyangwa hanze yanjye.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Icyo ni ikibazo gusa.
'	'
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You have to go back soon.	Ugomba gusubira vuba.
Not always the same.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari kimwe.
But he is also scared.	Ariko kandi afite ubwoba.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
You don't think so.	Ntabwo utekereza.
Going out.	Kujya hanze.
You may know many.	Ushobora kuba uzi benshi.
Apparently he had an idea.	Biragaragara ko yari afite igitekerezo.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
He said he did not.	Yavuze ko atabikoze.
Why, obviously.	Impamvu, biragaragara.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuba hano.
Go, go, go, go.	Ejo, ejo, iri joro.
Before eating	Mbere yo kurya.
I'm going to live with you.	Ngiye kubana nawe.
Very close.	Hafi cyane.
I want to know how to do it.	Ndashaka kumenya kubikora.
You have to read everything.	Ugomba gusoma byose.
He thought it was not long.	Yatekereje ko atari igihe kinini.
Absolutely everything.	Ibintu byose rwose.
Certainly, it is possible.	Rwose, birashoboka.
He was behind everything.	Yari inyuma muri byose.
You think as usual.	Uratekereza nkuko bisanzwe.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
Simple, but good.	Byoroshye, ariko byiza.
Doing what he wanted.	Gukora ibyo yashakaga.
And we are human.	Kandi turi abantu.
I want to go tomorrow.	Ndashaka kugenda ejo.
I need to make that plan.	Nkwiye kuba nkeneye gukora iyo gahunda.
We have to go far.	Tugomba kuva kure.
He was not.	Ntiyari.
I think so too.	Ndatekereza na we.
But you have to.	Ariko ugomba.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
They are not human beings at all.	Ntabwo ari abantu rwose.
I'm glad to go.	Nishimiye kugenda.
This, however, is not always true.	Ibi ariko, ntabwo buri gihe ari ukuri.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
To live.	Kubana.
He could have lived in that easier.	Yashoboraga kubaho muri byo byoroshye.
His luck is here, in this room.	Amahirwe ye ari hano, muri iki cyumba.
There is a lot of food here.	Hano hari ibiryo byinshi.
She is a very good teacher.	Ni umwarimu mwiza cyane.
If you do, you can succeed.	Niba ukora, urashobora gutsinda.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
It will not be good.	Ntabwo bizaba byiza.
There is no reason to do this.	Nta mpamvu yo gukora ibi.
I don't want to be with him.	Sinshaka kubana na we.
That's right.	Nibyo.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
John was right.	Yohana yari afite ukuri.
By now, that was easy enough.	Kuri ubu, ibyo byari byoroshye bihagije.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He went.	Yagiye.
I think it's my fault.	Ntekereza ko ari amakosa yanjye.
I am very happy to do this.	Nishimiye cyane gukora ibi.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
He likes to go fast.	Akunda kugenda vuba.
Before you find anything to eat alone.	Mbere yo kubona ikintu cyose cyo kurya wenyine.
He always wants to be good.	Buri gihe aba ashaka kuba mwiza.
Watch a good movie.	Kureba firime nziza.
There are a lot of people.	Hariho abantu benshi.
I knew how to do it.	Nari nzi kubikora.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
It’s not enough to just get what you want.	Ntabwo bihagije kubona gusa icyo ushaka.
Something big.	Ikintu ni kinini.
Tell me that	Mbwira uko.
Here you can't help but think.	Hano ntushobora gufasha gutekereza.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi cyane.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ntacyo ushobora gukora hano.
That's great.	Ibyo ni byiza cyane.
They are friends.	Ni inshuti.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko atigeze ashaka.
No one would take it.	Nta n'umwe yari gufata.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ibyo byari ukuri.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
That's right- this is not about me.	Icyo ni ukuri, ntabwo ari igitekerezo.
I thought about that for a while.	Natekereje kuri ibyo igihe gito.
But it's really good.	Ariko ni byiza rwose.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo mubyukuri.
And on top.	Kandi hejuru.
I'm not very home.	Ntabwo ndi murugo cyane.
He did not know what he was supposed to be.	Ntiyari azi icyo yagombaga kuba.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
But it was a problem.	Ariko byari ikibazo.
He needed a car to work.	Yari akeneye imodoka yo gukora.
He should not know.	Ntabwo agomba kumenya.
He said a lot.	Yavuze cyane.
In fact, that's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Mubyukuri, nibyo akora byiza.
I feel good about eating.	Numva ari byiza kurya.
Nothing, really.	Ntacyo, mubyukuri.
It was me, everything to me.	Nari njye, byose kuri njye.
He is my best friend.	Ni inshuti yanjye nziza rwose.
Bottom line, in fact.	Hasi, mubyukuri.
That is not true.	Ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
I am a child.	Ndi umwana.
Well done, food, time.	Nibyiza, ibiryo, igihe.
We had none.	Ntabwo twari dufite.
But this is the last thing.	Ariko iki kintu cya nyuma.
I think it would be better now.	Ntekereza ko ubu byaba byiza.
He looked closely, close.	Yarebye cyane, hafi.
Maybe this is true.	Ahari ibi ni ukuri.
He must know what he is doing.	Agomba kumenya ibyo akora.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
That's not the case.	Ntabwo aribyo cyane.
This is my fault.	Ubu ni amakosa yanjye.
You can't be alone.	Ntushobora kuba wenyine.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
But you didn't.	Ariko ntabwo wabikoze.
Get a plan!	Kubona na gahunda!.
I love the truth.	Nkunda ukuri.
That would come.	Ibyo byari kuza.
I want to make money.	Ndashaka gushaka amafaranga.
After all, it was probably just a mistake.	Nyuma ya byose, birashoboka ko byari amakosa gusa.
He had something to eat.	Yari afite ibyo kurya.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
You have it in you.	Ufite muri wowe.
I needed a job.	Nari nkeneye akazi.
Apparently he was drinking.	Biragaragara ko yari kunywa.
The last thing.	Ikintu cya nyuma.
I was looking for a house.	Nashakaga inzu.
I thought so too.	Nanjye natekerezaga gutya.
He has a big deal.	Afite ikintu kinini.
I'm playing.	Ndimo gukina.
We have to do this.	Tugomba gukora ibi.
I feel that way.	Ndumva aribyo byinshi.
I thought so too.	Nanjye natekerezaga ko.
Or better yet.	Cyangwa nibyiza.
I didn't need anything.	Ntacyo nari nkeneye.
I believe in many things now.	Ndizera ibintu byinshi ubu.
I am always on time.	Buri gihe ndi ku gihe.
You have to go well.	Ugomba kugenda neza.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I love people.	Nkunda abantu.
But he was very skilled.	Ariko yari umuhanga cyane.
Not everything went well.	Ntabwo ibintu byose byagenze neza.
I thought that would be enough.	Natekereje ko ibyo bizaba bihagije.
He could have done it alone.	Yashoboraga kubikora wenyine.
He is good in everything.	Ni mwiza muri byose.
Well, at least you didn't go down without explaining yourself first.	Nibyiza, ntushobora kugira byose.
He didn't need to.	Ntabwo yari akeneye.
You always want more.	Buri gihe ushaka byinshi.
And there is another problem.	Kandi hariho ikindi kibazo.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
The food was not always good.	Ibiryo ntabwo buri gihe byari byiza.
It's so beautiful.	Ni mwiza cyane.
He had no plans at all.	Ntabwo yari afite gahunda rwose.
There is a lot to come.	Hariho byinshi byo kuza.
I am not at home, this is not at home.	Ntabwo ndi murugo, iyi ntabwo ari murugo.
I know nothing.	Ntacyo nzi.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
Nothing for him here.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri we hano.
I can't wait.	Ntashobora gutegereza.
But it seems to be.	Ariko birasa nkaho ari.
In fact, the day may come soon.	Mubyukuri, uwo munsi urashobora kuza vuba.
I thought maybe.	Natekereje ko ahari.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He went.	Yagiye.
You have to be a problem.	Ugomba kuba ikibazo.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
We all need to do that.	Twese dukeneye kubikora.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
This would be time consuming.	Ibi byari kurya umwanya.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
I'm close.	Ndi hafi.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I want to be us.	Ndashaka kuba twe.
Things did not happen, they did not happen.	Ibintu ntabwo byagenze, ntabwo byagenze.
Very friendly	Inshuti cyane.
The child we all fear to have.	Umwana twese dufite ubwoba bwo kugira.
Long time no see.	Igihe kinini.
Shame, shame.	Isoni, isoni.
We really are.	Turi rwose.
And he would do it.	Kandi yari kubikora.
You don't have time to work.	Ntabwo ufite umwanya wo gukora.
Plenty and good.	Byinshi kandi byiza.
There is one thing.	Hariho ikintu kimwe.
And he is not a small person.	Kandi ntabwo ari umuntu muto.
Now I can't stop walking.	Ubu ntashobora guhagarika kugenda.
Only a player who works.	Gusa umukinnyi ukora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Just one.	Umwe gusa.
And you have a lot.	Kandi ufite byinshi.
They had no idea.	Ntabwo bari bafite igitekerezo.
Until then, far.	Kugeza icyo gihe, kure.
Good thing for us all.	Ikintu cyiza kuri twese.
Absolutely quit.	Kureka rwose.
It's great to be home.	Nibyiza cyane gutaha murugo.
He can do it.	Ashobora kubikora.
I had an idea.	Nagize igitekerezo.
Lots to take.	Byinshi gufata.
The man was bad.	Uwo muntu yari mubi.
We just have to talk to you.	Tugomba kuvugana nawe gusa.
People were human.	Abantu bari abantu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko afite ukuri.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, birashoboka rwose.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
This, for one.	Ibi, kuri umwe.
But he would live together.	Ariko yari kubana.
But he needed to go.	Ariko yari akeneye kugenda.
And you can't either.	Kandi nawe ntushobora.
Stop thinking it's good.	Reka gutekereza ko ari byiza.
I think now is a good time.	Ndatekereza ubu ni igihe cyiza.
And it is.	Kandi ni.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu ibi.
That's what you had.	Nibyo wari ufite.
I mean to say, to hear.	Ndashaka kuvuga, kumva.
I don't know what to do.	Ntabwo nzi icyo gukora.
Not tonight.	Ntabwo ari muri iri joro.
He is now on one.	Ubu ari kuri umwe.
Never.	Nta na rimwe.
You need a reason to go out.	Ukeneye impamvu yo kujya hanze.
If that is the case.	Niba aricyo kibazo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo aribyo byose.
Not recently.	Ntabwo ari vuba aha.
And learning.	No kwiga.
Good question to have.	Ikibazo cyiza cyo kugira.
But the idea is the same.	Ariko igitekerezo ni kimwe.
I'm not sure what happened.	Ntabwo nzi neza uko byagenze.
I think he will be ready to play.	Ndatekereza ko azaba yiteguye gukina.
I want to stop the time.	Ndashaka guhagarika umwanya.
That's not a big deal.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo kinini.
I didn't want to talk to you again.	Sinifuzaga kongera kuvugana nawe.
Nothing, but it is small.	Ntacyo, ariko ni gito.
Or something.	Cyangwa ikintu.
That's not what we have here.	Ntabwo aribyo dufite hano.
He had enough.	Yari afite bihagije.
You can stay there.	Urashobora kuguma aho.
In the name.	Mu nama.
Probably not all.	Birashoboka ko atari bose.
I have a problem.	Mfite ikibazo.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He could have told me before he left.	Yashoboraga kumbwira mbere yo kugenda.
Why do we need it.	Dukeneye kuki.
This looks great.	Ibi birasa neza.
He tried to look at someone.	Yagerageje kureba umuntu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Things we need.	Ibintu dukeneye.
Inside together.	Imbere hamwe.
I thought he was doing that.	Natekerezaga neza ko akora ibyo.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
You have problems.	Ufite ibibazo.
You have a lot of time.	Ufite igihe kinini.
Have you ever wondered?	Wigeze utekereza.
She needs to get it.	Akeneye kubona.
And in that he was right.	Kandi muri ibyo yari afite ukuri.
I wanted to say something else.	Nashakaga kuvuga ikindi.
I wanted that from the beginning.	Nashakaga ibyo kuva mbere.
I can't see.	Sinshobora kureba.
Good idea,.	Igitekerezo cyiza ,.
You have to tell them what to do.	Ugomba kubwira icyo gukora.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
He would do it then.	Icyo gihe yari kubikora.
And he did something.	Kandi hari icyo yakoze.
It would be too far.	Yaba ari kure cyane.
You have a problem.	Urimo ikibazo.
More than fear.	Kurenza ubwoba.
Good guy	Umusore mwiza.
Everything.	Byose.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
It wasn’t too much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi cyane.
But you don’t have to.	Ariko ntugomba.
He was going.	Yaba agiye.
It's not money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga.
Here for everyone.	Hano kuri buri wese.
For this he is near.	Kuri ibi ari hafi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo bose.
We're all out.	Twese hanze.
He is drinking a lot.	Arimo kunywa cyane.
I don’t want to go back in time.	Sinshaka gusubira mu gihe.
But he is a person with a plan.	Ariko ni umuntu ufite gahunda.
A young child.	Umwana muto.
If anything, he looked.	Niba hari ikintu, yasaga.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Here every day.	Hano hano buri munsi.
And he was.	Kandi yari.

He was right, in fact.	Yari afite ukuri, mu kuri.
He seemed to be alone.	Yasaga naho ari wenyine.
He had his time.	Yari afite igihe cye.
Maybe he can try this.	Ahari arashobora kugerageza iki.
It wasn’t just me.	Ntabwo yari njye gusa.
He picked up the phone a lot.	Yafashe terefone cyane.
You don't have to be.	Ntugomba kuba.
I know what he thinks.	Nzi icyo atekereza.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko ibyo atari byo byose.
He can say what he wants to say.	Arashobora kuvuga icyo ashaka kuvuga.
No one was good.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari mwiza.

He wanted to be alone.	Yashakaga kuba wenyine.
The woman he loved.	Umugore yakundaga.

The woman needed it.	Umugore yari akeneye.
He was about to leave.	Yari agiye kuva hano.
This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari.
First and foremost, you have to win.	Mbere na mbere, ugomba gutsinda.
I saw something.	Nabonye ikintu.
It's good and it's really possible.	Nibyiza kandi birashoboka rwose.
This evil must be something.	Uyu mubi mubi agomba kuba ikintu.
But that's what he says.	Ariko ibyo aribyo avuga.

None of this is your fault.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari amakosa yawe.
You can't think of anything else to say.	Ntushobora gutekereza ikindi kintu cyose cyo kuvuga.
I wanted to do it again.	Nashakaga kongera kubikora.
Na na na na.	Na na na na.

He had time.	Yari afite umwanya.
And that is something else.	Kandi icyo ni ikindi kintu.
I can't think.	Sinshobora gutekereza.
Everything is always difficult for me.	Ibintu byose bigoye buri gihe ni njye.
I didn’t just get the chance to be a woman.	Ntabwo nabonye amahirwe yo kuba umugore gusa.
This is a good idea.	Iki ni igitekerezo cyiza.
I understand everything now.	Ndumva byose ubu.
I want to try something.	Ndashaka kugerageza ikintu.

The house was not far away.	Inzu ntiyari kure.
It was just a matter of walking upstairs.	Byari ikibazo cyo kugenda gusa hejuru.

He later became worse.	Nyuma yaje kuba mubi.
It has not always been easy.	Ntabwo buri gihe byari byoroshye.
I don't know when.	Sinzi igihe.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
I found a nice house.	Nabonye inzu nziza.
He went outside.	Yagiye hanze.
He was worried.	Yari afite impungenge.
He was behind me.	Yari inyuma yanjye.
All of this is possible.	Ibyo byose birashoboka.
He loved to drive.	Yakundaga gutwara.
That's a big deal.	Icyo ni ikintu kinini.
Just walking.	Kugenda gusa.
This was before.	Ibi byari mbere.
I was very lucky.	Nagize amahirwe cyane.
I needed to be me.	Nari nkeneye kuba njye.
Everything was fine.	Byose byari byiza.
From the outside.	Kuva hanze.
Obviously he doesn’t want to talk to us.	Biragaragara ko adashaka kuvugana natwe.
What should he do.	Ni iki agomba gukora.
This is normal.	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe.
Everyone should eat enough.	Umuntu wese agomba kurya bihagije.
Shame, he thought it was.	Isoni, yatekereje ko aribyo.
More than fear.	Kurenza ubwoba.
I didn't know anyone.	Nta muntu n'umwe nari nzi.
But he did not want to.	Ariko ntiyashakaga.
He was the one he didn't know.	Uwo yari uwo atazi.
He is not a child.	Ntabwo ari umwana.

He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kugenda.
And this is a great time to do it.	Kandi iki ni igihe cyiza cyo kubikora.
I saw one person above me.	Nabonye umuntu umwe hejuru yanjye.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
We may not do this.	Ibi dushobora kutabikora.
He was still a child at the time.	Icyo gihe yari akiri umwana.
But all is well.	Ariko byose ni byiza.
He had what he came for.	Yari afite ibyo yaje.
You don’t just have to win here.	Ntagomba gutsinda hano gusa.
I was alone.	Nari wenyine.
I can live here for a long time.	Nshobora kubaho hano igihe kirekire.
He was probably scared.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ubwoba.
They were scared.	Bari bafite ubwoba.
The next meeting.	Inama iri imbere.
There are many.	Hariho benshi.
You want to go back.	Urashaka gusubira inyuma.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nashakaga kuvugana nawe.
Bad guy	Umuntu mubi.
It was not your fault.	Ntabwo wari amakosa yawe.
More than ever, below average.	Kurenza na rimwe, munsi ya buri gihe.
We have to be so far.	Tugomba kuba kugeza ubu.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I don’t know how that is possible.	Ntabwo nzi uburyo ibyo bishoboka.
I saw all that.	Nabonye ibyo byose.
Maybe he doesn't need a car.	Birashoboka ko atari akeneye imodoka.
For me it is home.	Kuri njye ni murugo.
It was a great plan.	Byari gahunda nziza.
I really doubt it.	Ndashidikanya rwose.
You need a school.	Ukeneye ishuri.
You have to give up this.	Ugomba kureka ibi.
But he said nothing.	Ariko nta kintu na kimwe yari yavuze.
He did not have a car.	Ntiyari afite imodoka.
In fact, there is no film.	Mubyukuri, nta na firime.
You did it right.	Wabikoze neza.
It was his father's place.	Wari umwanya wa se.
No one.	Nta n'umwe.

If he hadn't heard of it, he would have left.	Niba ntacyo yumvise, yari kugenda.
Or what you need.	Cyangwa ibyo ukeneye.
He will never want to.	Ntazigera ashaka.
I mean, it’s a big book.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ni igitabo kinini.
Helping people is good.	Gufasha abantu nibyiza.
It's good for us.	Ni byiza kuri twe.
I needed food.	Nari nkeneye ibiryo.
I hope he did.	Ndizera ko yabikoze.
It's just a matter of time.	Ni ikibazo gusa.
Obviously you are one.	Biragaragara ko uri umwe.
He did not always think before.	Ntabwo buri gihe yatekerezaga mbere.
He really did go.	Yagiye rwose.
It was a beautiful day and everyone was outside.	Wari umunsi mwiza kandi abantu bose bari hanze.
That was really nice to have kids.	Ibyo rwose byari byiza kubana.
You have to do it yourself.	Ugomba kubikora wenyine.
.	.
He went to jail.	Yagiye muri gereza.
You have a friend in me now.	Ufite inshuti muri njye ubu.
And what is this.	Kandi ni iki.

I want to play.	Ndashaka gukina.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
But that was close enough.	Ariko ibyo byari hafi bihagije.
He really had.	Yari afite rwose.
But, that’s not my favorite.	Ariko, ibyo ntabwo aribyo nkunda.
He is just one person.	Ni umuntu umwe gusa.
I think that's the problem.	Ntekereza ko ari ikibazo.
She loved the baby.	Yakundaga umwana.
He chose to do it.	Yahisemo kubikora.
You can't even tell what you mean.	Ntushobora no kumenya icyo ushaka kuvuga.
He didn't mean to offend.	Ntabwo yashakaga kuvuga.
I don't want to go home.	Ntashaka gutaha.
Sometimes he wants to be alone.	Rimwe na rimwe aba ashaka kuba wenyine.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
It's all good to see.	Byose ni byiza kubona.
I want to talk soon.	Ndashaka kuvuga vuba.

Very nice and nice.	Byiza cyane kandi byiza.
And it looks good.	Kandi birasa neza.
And you are lucky.	Kandi ufite amahirwe.
You can't go.	Ntushobora kugenda.
I don't know how to do it right.	Sinzi uburyo bwo kubikora neza.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Being alone.	Kuba wenyine.
She was very beautiful, and her hair was very beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane, kandi umusatsi we wari mwiza cyane.
He did not.	Ntabwo yakoze.
The car was great.	Imodoka yari nziza.
But there is another problem.	Ariko hariho ikindi kibazo.
'	'
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
I think it worked.	Ntekereza ko byagenze neza.
I'm getting one too.	Nanjye ndimo kubona umwe.
He is not in it.	Ntabwo ari muri we.
That’s fine, and that’s not the case.	Nibyiza, kandi ntabwo aribyo.
I can always go back to that.	Nshobora buri gihe gusubira kuri ibyo.

He was there for everything.	Yari ahari kuri buri kintu cyose.
This time he was going to play this outside.	Iki gihe yari agiye gukina ibi hanze.
The girl really knew what she wanted.	Umukobwa rwose yari azi icyo ashaka.
Everything was great.	Byose byari byiza cyane.
He was in my house.	Yari mu nzu yanjye.
But that’s not easy.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo byoroshye.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I love how it happened.	Nkunda uko byagenze.
I thought a lot.	Natekereje cyane.
I had this problem.	Nari mfite iki kibazo.
I want a lot of things.	Ndashaka ibintu byinshi.
And everything is easy.	Kandi byose byoroshye.
He is a very handsome young man.	Ni umusore mwiza cyane.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
The idea came to him.	Igitekerezo yaje kuri we.
He was very worried.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi.
They don't know what it is.	Ntabwo bazi icyo aricyo.
It was on this.	Byari kuri ibi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
It didn't look very good.	Ntabwo yasaga cyane.
I may have misunderstood.	Nshobora kuba numvise nabi.
No one is around.	Nta muntu uri hafi.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari rimwe na rimwe.
He is confident that he has that.	Yizeye neza ko afite ibyo.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ni umukobwa mwiza.
And you are.	Kandi uri.
That was before she became a woman.	Ibyo byari mbere yuko aba umugore.
He is always an expert.	Ahora ari umuhanga.
It would be a party.	Byaba ibirori.
He took the girl.	Yafashe umukobwa.
Where is he? 	Ari he?
Tell me what he said.	Mbwira ibyo yavuze.
You have to do something about it.	Ni wowe ugomba gukora ikintu muri byo.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
They were not very close.	Ntabwo bari hafi cyane.
I was not at work today.	Uyu munsi ntabwo nari ku kazi.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
Or maybe it's just me.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko ari njye gusa.
He was a teacher.	Yari umwarimu.
You can do everything.	Urashobora gukora byose.
That is very clear.	Ibyo biragaragara cyane.
That was normal.	Ibyo byari bisanzwe.
I'm just a player.	Ndi umukinnyi gusa.
It seemed to be the norm.	Yasaga naho ari ibintu bisanzwe kuri byose.
I never liked this room.	Sinigeze nkunda iki cyumba.
He hears a lot of things.	Yumva ibintu byinshi.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
He looked into the last room.	Yarebye mu cyumba bwa nyuma.
How?	Nigute?
And very, very smart.	Kandi cyane, ubwenge cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I didn't see anyone.	Nta muntu nabonye.
You can, too.	Urashobora, nawe.
That he could work on the phone.	Ko yashoboraga gukora kuri terefone.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
He was not only beautiful.	Ntabwo yari mwiza gusa.
And you know who he is.	Kandi uzi uwo ari we.
Someone will do it.	Umuntu azabikora.
That's not a problem.	Ntabwo ari ikibazo.
That was enough.	Icyo gihe byari bihagije.
But he did.	Ariko yagize icyo atekereza.
She works well at work.	Akora neza ku kazi.
He needs everything.	Akeneye byose.
What they both had.	Ibyo bombi bari bafite.
He didn't want anything.	Nta na kimwe yashakaga.
I never had to trust anyone.	Ntabwo nigeze ngomba kwizera umuntu uwo ari we wese.
You can't be good.	Ntushobora kuba mwiza.
You can.	Wowe ushobora.
That would be it.	Byaba aribyo.
He was upstairs talking.	Yari hejuru aho avuga.
I like to go fast.	Nkunda kugenda vuba.
He did not have.	Ntiyari afite.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
We must believe.	Tugomba kwizera.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
I hear people.	Ndumva abantu.
I have to be on schedule.	Ngomba kuba kuri gahunda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yaba afite ubwenge kutabikora.
You're just going to live for a while.	Ugiye kubaho gusa mugihe gito.
I wanted to talk to him.	Nashakaga kuvugana na we.
He is not in this world.	Ntabwo ari kuri iyi si.
All we can know is this world.	Icyo dushobora kumenya ni iyi si.
It is a book.	Ni igitabo.
Maybe you too.	Birashoboka ko nawe.
But it was a mistake.	Ariko byari amakosa.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
Or just to say.	Cyangwa kuvuga gusa.
It is possible to have more than one.	Birashoboka kurenza umwe.
I am at home in good times.	Ndi murugo mugihe cyiza.
In fact, he did not choose the issue.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yahisemo icyo kibazo.
I knew what to do.	Nari nzi icyo gukora.
It was good for him.	Byari byiza kuri we.
I need to have that.	Nkeneye kugira ibyo.
All is well.	Byose ni byiza.
Saying he can do it.	Kuvuga niba ashobora kubikora.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza gusa!.
She was beautiful.	Yari mwiza.
And it was probably good.	Kandi birashoboka ko byari byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
This went well.	Ibi byagenze neza.
This one was not.	Uyu ntiyari.
We are the most difficult people in the world.	Turi abantu bigoye cyane kuri iyi si.
He knew that.	Ibyo yari azi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
I'm sure it's not true.	Nzi neza ko atari ukuri.
I don't know when.	Sinzi igihe.
I understand what you want to do.	Ndumva icyo ushaka gukora.
He has to leave today.	Agomba kugenda uyu munsi.
I know everyone.	Nzi abantu bose.
I think that is possible.	Ndakeka ko ibyo bishoboka.
Far, far away.	Kure, kure cyane.
It was a good idea.	Byari igitekerezo cyiza.
One has to say what it is.	Umuntu agomba kuvuga icyo aricyo.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It’s not a good movie.	Ntabwo ari firime nziza.
I thought it was good for him.	Natekereje ko byari byiza kuri we.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
He would not stay for long.	Ntabwo yari kuguma igihe kirekire.
I'm glad to be here.	Nishimiye kuguma hano.
But to do so is something else.	Ariko kubikora ni ikindi kintu.
But today.	Ariko kuri uyu munsi.
It's not in the morning.	Ntabwo ari mu gitondo.
But in reality he was very worried.	Ariko mubyukuri yari afite impungenge cyane.
It’s something he used to think about.	Ni ikintu yakundaga gutekereza.
He was closer than that.	Yari hafi cyane kuruta ibyo.
Here, there is only one.	Hano, hari umwe gusa.
I never did anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe nigeze nkora.
He is going to be his father.	Agiye kuba se.
We have to go to work.	Tugomba kujya mu kazi.
He said nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yavuze.
Being around for a while.	Kuba hafi igihe gito.
But nothing for me.	Ariko ntacyo kuri njye.
Now he is gone.	Ubu yagiye.
You know we have.	Uzi ko dufite.
I need help with this.	Nkeneye ubufasha muri ibi.
And it was close.	Kandi byari hafi.
Everyone here could do it.	Umuntu wese hano yashoboraga kubikora.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Or you can come here.	Cyangwa urashobora kuza hano.
I got it.	Nabonye kubikora.
It was a beautiful day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza cyane.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Gusa ukeneye gukora gahunda.
It will be up to him.	Bizaba kuri we.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's really good for me.	Nibyiza rwose kuri njye.
We have to get out of this world.	Tugomba kuva kuri iyi si.
I don't know enough.	Sinzi bihagije.
He's going to be really good.	Agiye kuba mwiza rwose.
I am so happy to be back.	Nishimiye cyane gusubira inyuma.
I hope you do well.	Ndizera ko ukora neza.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu icyo aricyo cyose.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Mbabajwe n'iki kibazo cyose.
You like to read.	Ukunda gusoma.
He told me he had really gone.	Yambwiye ko yari yagiye koko.
We can all win.	Twese dushobora gutsinda.
No work without play.	Nta kazi nta gukina.
And not too early.	Kandi si kare cyane.
That is not the case today.	Ntabwo aribyo muri iki gihe.
We had no money at all.	Ntabwo twari dufite amafaranga rwose.
I have a family.	Mfite umuryango.
Back to back	Inyuma inyuma.
We haven't been here for a long time.	Ntabwo turi hano igihe kirekire.
Especially when he had a lot to live for.	Cyane cyane iyo yari afite byinshi byo kubaho.
Nothing here.	Nta kintu na kimwe hano.
I should help with that.	Nkwiye gufasha muri ibyo.
I was not a woman.	Ntabwo nari umugore.
More and more.	Byinshi kandi byinshi.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
You don’t have to be scared.	Ntugomba kugira ubwoba.
I can't say for sure.	Sinshobora kuvuga neza.
She is the only woman.	Ni umugore wenyine.
You can't wait to do it tonight.	Ntushobora gutegereza gukora iri joro.
He thought of this good.	Yatekereje kuri ibi byiza.
It seems to be good.	Birasa nkaho ari byiza.
I mean absolutely horrible.	Ndashaka kuvuga ubwoba rwose.
We must believe.	Tugomba kwizera.
If so, it worked just fine.	Niba aribyo, byagenze neza gusa.
I have to go now.	Ngomba kugenda ubu.
Absolutely this.	Ibi rwose.
There is something else you said.	Hariho ikindi kintu wavuze.
However, we cannot know for sure and we can only think.	Ariko, ntidushobora kumenya neza kandi dushobora gutekereza gusa.
His father may have a plan.	Se ashobora kuba afite gahunda.
I thought of something though.	Natekereje ku kintu ariko.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But you have to say it was great.	Ariko ugomba kuvuga ko byari byiza cyane.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ubu umuntu afite.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ibyo sibyo.
I would like a place here.	Ndashaka umwanya hano.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
That's right.	Ni ukuri.
Her hair is young.	Umusatsi we ni muto.
That would be money.	Ibyo byaba ari amafaranga.
Hano hano.	Hano hano.
I didn't want to hear much.	Sinifuzaga kumva byinshi.
But in reality it is not easy.	Ariko mubyukuri ntabwo byoroshye.
He needed time to think.	Yari akeneye igihe cyo gutekereza.
We have a little time.	Dufite umwanya muto.
I was looking for money.	Nashakaga amafaranga.
We didn't have the money to eat.	Ntabwo twari dufite amafaranga yo kurya.
What you may want to know.	Ibyo ushobora kuba ushaka kumenya.
I am lucky.	Ndi amahirwe yanjye.
People were scared.	Abantu bari bafite ubwoba.
What you do now.	Ibyo ukora ubu.
But this was not a human being.	Ariko uyu ntiyari umuntu.
He didn't want her to be nice.	Ntiyashakaga ko agira neza.
You have to go for it.	Ugomba kujya kuri ibyo.
It's a lot.	Ni nyinshi.
You can come and help.	Urashobora kuza gufasha.
But really, really.	Ariko mubyukuri, mubyukuri.
I know exactly what you mean.	Nzi neza icyo ushaka kuvuga.
A woman to eat.	Umugore wo kurya.
Same and same.	Kimwe kandi kimwe.
But it is absolutely true.	Ariko ni ukuri rwose.
But it is only for a short time.	Ariko ni igihe gito.
He did nothing.	Nta cyo yakoze.
But there is more to it.	Ariko hariho byinshi kuri ibyo.
He really wants to.	Arashaka rwose.
He has to be good inside.	Agomba kuba mwiza imbere.
He was one person.	Yari umuntu umwe.
There was nothing that anyone could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe umuntu yashoboraga gukora.
This one.	Uyu.
The baby had come and gone quickly.	Umwana yari yaje kandi agenda vuba.
Or a good movie.	Cyangwa firime nziza.
One to the point.	Kimwe kugeza kuri.
Or you have food.	Cyangwa ufite ibiryo.
I am learning a lot.	Ndimo kwiga byinshi.
I don't want to do anything else.	Sinshaka gukora ikindi kintu.
But it is true.	Ariko ni ukuri.
No one.	Nta muntu n'umwe.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
He has an idea.	Afite igitekerezo.
It is very likely that there is something to eat or something.	Birashoboka cyane ko hari ibyo kurya cyangwa ikindi kintu.
Not very smart, maybe.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge cyane, birashoboka.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
He chose to be alone today.	Yahisemo kuba wenyine muri iki gihe.
For him.	Kuri we.
Whatever he wants.	Icyo ashaka cyose.
That's right.	Nukuri.
You have to believe what you need and what you need to live.	Ugomba kwizera ibyo ukeneye nibyo ukeneye kubaho.
He did as he pleased.	Yakoze uko ashaka.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
It's not as good as mine.	Ntabwo ari byiza nkanjye.
But tonight, this last one, had to be.	Ariko iri joro, iyi ya nyuma, yagombaga.
Absolutely not.	Rwose, sibyo rwose.
Sometimes there is.	Rimwe na rimwe hariho.
He did not want to be friends.	Ntiyashakaga ko agira inshuti.
He had said a lot in the morning.	Yari yavuze byinshi mu gitondo.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
The most human being among us.	Umuntu cyane muri twe.
You don’t have to be close, not always.	Ntugomba kuba hafi, ntabwo buri gihe.
He doesn't have to go.	Ntabwo agomba kugenda.
You have to win.	Ugomba gutsinda.
He had a lot of hair.	Yari afite umusatsi cyane.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
Na se.	Na se.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyiza, nibyiza cyane.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
She wants it all to herself.	Ashaka ko byose kuri we.
Good friends	Inshuti nziza.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
Probably both.	Birashoboka ko bombi ari.
I know you were just a good friend.	Nzi ko wari inshuti nziza gusa.
It was a chance to live again.	Wari amahirwe yo kongera kubaho.
I'm close now.	Ubu ndi hafi.
It's not me.	Ntabwo ari njye.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
You have to work hard on your own.	Ugomba gukora cyane wenyine.
He was very skilled.	Yari umuhanga cyane.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo.
He is out every day with me.	Ari hanze buri munsi hamwe nanjye.
He wanted to get a job, he said.	Yashakaga kubona akazi, yavuze.
He didn't have to wait long.	Ntabwo yagombaga gutegereza igihe kirekire.
I'm glad to hear that.	Nishimiye kumva.
Women.	Akazi.
I can talk	Nshobora kuvugana.
But there is something else you need to do.	Ariko hari ikindi kintu ugomba gukora.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
I have to be good, smart.	Ngomba kuba mwiza, ubwenge.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
Meditation and meditation.	Gutekereza no gutekereza.
He went to the phone quickly.	Yagiye kuri terefone vuba.
It was great out here.	Byari byiza cyane hanze aha.
In fact, it's just a matter of time.	Mubyukuri, ni ikibazo gusa.
But you have to be here.	Ariko ugomba kuba hano.
He got it all.	Yabonye byose.
He seemed to be thinking.	Yasaga naho yatekerezaga.
It started as before.	Yatangiye nk'uko yari afite mbere.
Not everything was good.	Ntabwo byose byari byiza.
It wouldn’t take much.	Ntiyari gutwara byinshi.
It's up to me.	Ni wowe kuri njye.
But I was well aware.	Ariko nari nzi neza.
We are on top.	Turi hejuru.
You have to try.	Ugomba kugerageza.
He told me he was worried.	Yambwiye ko afite impungenge.
He had gone here before.	Yari yagiye hano mbere.
What they had, in the end.	Ibyo bari bafite, amaherezo.
No one knew for sure.	Nta n'umwe yari azi neza.
He is probably scared.	Birashoboka ko afite ubwoba.
It was hard to say.	Byari bigoye kuvuga.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
But that is not me.	Ariko uwo si njye.
What he said.	Ibyo yavuze.
And this is good.	Kandi ibi ni byiza.
He is playing.	Arimo gukina.
It is best to take external help.	Nibyiza gufata ubufasha bwo hanze.
It was too far.	Yari kure cyane.
You can see things outside.	Urashobora kubona ibintu hanze.
They know how to play well.	Bazi gukina neza.
What we have is luck.	Ibyo dufite ni amahirwe.
This is not always true.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari ukuri.
I'm good at it now.	Ubu ndi mwiza kuri byo.
And sometimes it is possible.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe birashoboka.
From his father.	Kuva kuri se.
Everyone has their needs.	Umuntu wese afite ibyo akeneye.
I mean, as usual.	Ndashaka kuvuga, uko bisanzwe.
He should not go alone.	Ntagomba kugenda wenyine.
And no.	Kandi ntabwo.
This was also normal.	Ibi kandi byari ibintu bisanzwe.
No need to take.	Nta mpamvu yo gufata.
He had it before.	Yigeze kugira mbere.
I think there is.	Ntekereza ko hari.
I don't know what happened then.	Ntabwo nzi uko byagenze icyo gihe.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
I am happy for the opportunity.	Nishimiye amahirwe.
I can't understand why.	Sinshobora kumva impamvu.
I want to stay.	Ndashaka kuguma.
I got the money.	Nabonye amafaranga.
The food is not good here.	Ibiryo ntabwo ari byiza hano.
It's good and it's good.	Nibyiza kandi ni byiza.
Too many people.	Abantu benshi cyane.
He is one person.	Ni umuntu umwe.
Everything out here.	Byose hanze aha.
He could hear nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga kumva.
Now he is doing well.	Ubu arimo akora neza.
That's right.	Nibyo ibi.
I don’t think they have a way to do it.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko bafite uburyo bwo kubikora.
You just want to be with her.	Urashaka kubana na we gusa.
He was almost here.	Yari hafi hano.
However, one would expect this to be difficult.	Ariko, umuntu yiteze ko ibyo byaba bigoye.
In fact you have.	Mubyukuri ufite.
In fact, it is possible.	Mubyukuri, birashoboka.
Family and faith.	Umuryango hamwe no kwizera.
As if he were not there.	Nkuko atari ahari.
This was very close.	Ibi byari hafi cyane.
Worse than that.	Mubyukuri mubi kuruta ibyo.
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
He was alone.	Yari wenyine.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
Good man.	Nibyiza umuntu.
I can't hear who.	Sinshobora kumva uwo.
This was great.	Ibi byari byiza.
Tell me good things.	Mbwira ibintu byiza.
But this was great.	Ariko ibi byari byiza cyane.
I didn’t want to be that person.	Sinifuzaga kuba uwo muntu.
By phone.	Terefone.
I was sure it wasn't.	Nari nzi neza ko atari byo.
She needs to drink.	Akeneye kunywa.
His friend was terrified.	Inshuti ye yagize ubwoba.
I would like a party.	Ndashaka ibirori.
If it is good.	Niba ari byiza.
And man, it was hard.	Kandi umuntu, byari bigoye.
What he can do.	Icyo ashobora gukora.
I thought about it a lot.	Natekereje kuri byinshi.
Well, so far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Nibyiza, kugeza ubu ni ikintu, abantu.
Outside and outside.	Hanze kandi hanze.
Looks like he has a lot.	Birasa naho afite byinshi.
Especially if you are in school.	Cyane cyane niba uri mwishuri.
I have to think about everything.	Ngomba gutekereza byose.
You are a bad thing.	Wowe ikintu kibi.
Same problem.	Ikibazo kimwe.
Really, really.	Nukuri, mubyukuri.
Of course, we can't live together sometimes.	Nibyo, ntidushobora kubana rimwe na rimwe.
Whatever he went for.	Ibyo ari byo byose yagiye.
It’s not a party.	Ntabwo ari ibirori.
Everything went well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza.
We can't do it.	Ntidushobora gukora.
It's not tonight.	Ntabwo ari iri joro.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
He wanted to buy time.	Yashakaga kugura umwanya.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He did not need to live.	Ntabwo yari akeneye kubaho.
I like the problem.	Nkunda ikibazo.
No problem.	Nta kibazo.
I didn't want to be together.	Sinifuzaga kubana.
I'm so sorry.	Mbabajwe rwose.
This whole thing.	Iki kintu cyose.
That was a concern.	Ibyo byari impungenge.
Not years.	Ntabwo ari imyaka.
He did not love his father.	Ntabwo yakundaga se.
It's really nice.	Ni mwiza rwose.
What he wanted.	Icyo yashakaga.
He didn't look at anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yarebye.
You are.	Urimo.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
That is not the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
You saw that.	Wabonye ko.
And you were right.	Kandi wari ukuri.
First of all.	Ni kinini.
It's all easy.	Byose byoroshye.
Looks like they're on top of you.	Birasa nkaho bari hejuru yawe.
Bad thing.	Ikintu kibi.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
It’s not just an idea.	Ntabwo ari igitekerezo gusa.
I was not good.	Ntabwo nari mwiza.
Being there.	Kuba ahari.
He had everything he needed.	Yari afite ibyo yari akeneye byose.
No one needed to comment.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ukeneye kugira icyo avuga.
They are the first.	Ni aba mbere.
He has a friend.	Afite inshuti.
It was good enough.	Byari byiza bihagije.
No one was scared.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari ufite ubwoba.
And he wouldn't do it.	Kandi ntiyari kubikora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He picked up the phone.	Yafashe terefone.
I am just one of many.	Ndi umwe gusa muri benshi.
Or indeed.	Cyangwa rwose.
You can do it here.	Urashobora kubikora hano.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
You don't.	Ntabwo ukora.
And definitely not you.	Kandi rwose ntabwo ari wowe.
I am very ashamed.	Mfite isoni cyane.
I hope we all.	Ndizera ko twese.
You are my reason.	Ni wowe mpamvu yanjye.
Anyone can do simple things.	Umuntu wese arashobora gukora ibintu byoroshye.
And he was beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza.
I hope not.	Ndizera ko atari byo.
It's not long.	Ntabwo ari igihe kinini.
He didn't know it existed.	Ntiyari azi ko ahari.
But that is not all.	Ariko uwo si we rwose.
That's all you have to do.	Ibyo aribyo byose ugomba gukora.
I really don't have it.	Ntabwo rwose mfite.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
Lots of things.	Ibintu byinshi.
The truth was he had no idea.	Ukuri ntabwo yari afite igitekerezo.
And he can do it.	Kandi arashobora kubikora.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
And the idea.	Kandi igitekerezo.
It's far away.	Ni kure.
I can help a lot.	Nshobora gufasha byinshi.
My favorite is not that.	Nkunda ntabwo aribyo.
Can you do better ?.	Urashobora gukora neza?.
None of this is a thing.	Nta na kimwe muri byo ari ikintu.
He was not young.	Ntiyari muto.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
I was scared, maybe for a long time.	Nagize ubwoba, birashoboka ko igihe kinini.
He said people.	Yavuze ko abantu.
He didn't want to.	Ntiyashakaga.
This is not normal.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
Not many things.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byinshi.
It would do nothing.	Ntacyo byari gukora.
I shouldn’t have been inside.	Ntabwo nari nkwiye kuba imbere.
I always want more.	Buri gihe nshaka byinshi.
You don't know why.	Ntabwo uzi neza impamvu.
You've probably seen that thing so far.	Nukuri wabonye icyo kintu kugeza ubu.
You may be alone.	Urashobora kuba wowe wenyine.
He said one good thing to me.	Yavuze ikintu kimwe cyiza kuri njye.
But no one is above.	Ariko nta muntu uri hejuru.
To do so.	Kubikora.
But he had not asked any questions.	Ariko nta kibazo na kimwe yari yabajije.
He would be there today.	Uyu munsi yari kuba ahari.
I can't find the book.	Ntabwo mbona igitabo.
And that was the plan.	Kandi iyo yari gahunda.
And that, he thought, was true.	Kandi ibyo, yatekereje kure, byari ukuri.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekereje.
In the same room.	Mu cyumba kimwe.
It was very close.	Byari hafi cyane.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
I was on time too.	Nanjye nari igihe.
I guess a lot.	Ndakeka byinshi.
He knows how to get what he wants.	Azi uburyo bwo kubona icyo ashaka.
Yes, he was very young.	Nibyo, yari muto cyane.
And he didn't want to stay.	Kandi ntiyashakaga kuguma.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, nibyiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo hanze.
Go back.	Gusubira inyuma.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
Young child, it is very likely that it is.	Umwana muto, birashoboka cyane ko aribyo.
When he was younger, I was the only one.	Igihe yari akiri muto, ni njye gusa.
He needs both.	Yaba akeneye bombi.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
He can't do it.	Ntashobora kubikora.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
Early in the morning	Mu gitondo cya kare.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntabwo ari muto cyane.
That's all I can do.	Nibyo nshobora.
He told me a lot.	Yambwiye byinshi.
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane, mwiza.
I never saw this.	Sinigeze mbona ibi.
Money was a problem.	Amafaranga yari ikibazo.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
He saw people.	Yabonye abantu.
I thought it was good.	Natekerezaga ko byari byiza.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I didn't know how to do it.	Sinari nzi kubikora.
Or this week.	Cyangwa muri iki cyumweru.
Everything is the same.	Ibintu byose ni kimwe.
I can't think of you anymore.	Sinshobora kongera gutekereza nawe.
You don’t do everything at any time.	Ntabwo ukora ibintu byose mugihe icyo aricyo cyose mugihe.
He didn't even know where they were.	Ntiyari azi n'aho bari.
If you have a problem, you are not alone.	Niba ufite ikibazo, ntabwo uri wenyine.
I am not a woman.	Ntabwo ndi umugore.
I think we should stay here.	Ndatekereza ko tugomba kuguma hano.
Fast action is possible.	Gukora vuba bishoboka.
Here.	Hano.
Everyone knows something.	Umuntu wese azi ikintu.
It will be difficult.	Bizaba bigoye.
But me.	Ariko njye.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
There is a look right now.	Hariho kureba kuri ubu.
That will be me.	Ibyo bizaba njye.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
He just needed to watch.	Yari akeneye gusa kureba.
He is an expert.	Ni umuhanga.
That's him.	Uwo ni we.
We needed to get a job.	Twari dukeneye kubona akazi.
I like food.	Nkunda ibiryo.
I need to know if you are a good person.	Ngomba kumenya niba uri umuntu mwiza.
And that is me.	Kandi uwo ni njye.
He started walking fast.	Yatangiye kugenda vuba.
This is not only possible.	Ibi ntabwo bishoboka gusa.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
You are so beautiful to me.	Uri mwiza cyane kuri.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
That is possible.	Ibyo birashoboka.
He was a nice and nice person and very thoughtful.	Yari umuntu mwiza kandi mwiza kandi utekereza cyane.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
It's not too early.	Ntabwo ari kare cyane.
There is something for everyone.	Hari ikintu kuri buri wese.
I'm not sure about this.	Ntabwo nzi neza ibi.
At that time he meant.	Icyo gihe yashakaga kuvuga.
I think it's a party.	Ntekereza ko ari ibirori.
He is not.	Ntabwo ari we.
The food is good.	Ibiryo ni byiza.
In fact anything.	Mubyukuri ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
Leave the guy alone.	Reka umusore wenyine.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Now we have the opportunity.	Ubu dufite amahirwe.
He was no longer a young man.	Ntiyari akiri umusore.
As it was for me.	Nkuko byari kuri njye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
If anything, he was alone.	Niba hari ikintu, yari wenyine.
There are people like me.	Hariho abantu nkanjye.
He tried to speak.	Yagerageje kuvuga.
There is a way back home.	Hariho uburyo bwo gusubira murugo.
Now he doesn't know for sure.	Ubu ntabwo azi neza.
How can we talk ?.	Nigute dushobora kuvugana?.
Right now, he seemed worried.	Kuri ubu, yasaga naho afite impungenge.
It was good and easy.	Byari byiza kandi byoroshye.
For me.	Kuri njye.
They have the truth.	Bafite ukuri.
He was gone.	Yari yagiye.
Very high, if it were me.	Hejuru cyane, niba ari njye.
I meant.	Nashakaga kuvuga.
None of that.	Nta na kimwe muri byo.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
Very likely, you have everything you need.	Birashoboka cyane, ufite ibyo ukeneye byose.
Behind.	Inyuma.
You should try to make more friends.	Ugomba kugerageza gushaka inshuti nyinshi.
Everything is great.	Byose ni byiza cyane.
Far and near.	Kure cyane kandi hafi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari amakosa.
You are wrong.	Ufite amakosa.
It was not very good.	Ntabwo byari byiza cyane.
If you are lucky, you are beautiful.	Niba ufite amahirwe, uri mwiza.
As if nothing.	Nkaho ntacyo.
You at any time.	Wowe mugihe icyo aricyo cyose.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
She feels her hair.	Yumva umusatsi we.
Or you can do it today.	Cyangwa urashobora kubikora uyu munsi.
I enjoyed this program.	Nishimiye iyi gahunda.
But he also thought.	Ariko na we yatekerezaga.
I am looking for a new gift.	Ndashaka impano nshya.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
But he was gone.	Ariko yari amaze kugenda.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
The boy looked away.	Umuhungu yarebye kure.
You saw a woman.	Wabonye umugore.
My son is.	Umuhungu wanjye arimo.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko atari byo.
He was ready today.	Kuri uyu munsi yari yiteguye.
They were all there.	Bose bari.
It will be at any time.	Azaba igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
He is no longer a thinker.	Ntabwo akiri umuntu utekereza.
She was beautiful and alone.	Yari mwiza kandi wenyine.
I am human.	Ndi umuntu.
One day	Umunsi umwe.
He did it now.	Yabikoze ubu.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo byari kuba byiza.
He was a very handsome young man.	Yari umusore mwiza cyane.
Now he is scared.	Ubu afite ubwoba.
But he is alone.	Ariko we wenyine.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That was true at the time.	Icyo gihe byari ukuri.
I can't wait to read more from you.	Sinshobora gutegereza gusoma byinshi kure yawe.
I don't know.	Sinzi.
Simple is good.	Byoroshye ni byiza.
That he never heard.	Ko atigeze yumva.
He has a lot.	Afite byinshi.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
But he learned that he had no talent.	Ariko yamenye ko adafite impano.
I was working.	Nari nkora.
Time to think.	Igihe cyo gutekereza.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
The reason is who really has the problem.	Impamvu ninde ufite ikibazo nukuri.
Or one of them.	Cyangwa kimwe muri byo.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga ko mubyukuri.
Maybe not at the time, but definitely later.	Birashoboka ko atari icyo gihe, ariko rwose nyuma.
Seeing was something to watch.	Kubona byari ikintu cyo kureba.
I believe it is not his fault.	Nizera ko atari amakosa ye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko wigeze ukora ikintu kibi rwose.
Winning was easy.	Gutsinda byari byoroshye.
He was looking for money.	Yashakaga amafaranga.
I have one problem with that though.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe kuri ibyo ariko.
He did not want to do that.	Ntiyashakaga kubikora.
We have to do this.	Tugomba gukora ibi.
It's almost tomorrow.	Ni hafi ejo.
I like it for me.	Nkunda kuri njye.
And it was great.	Kandi byari byiza cyane.
She had a child.	Yari afite umwana.
I saw a walk.	Nabonye kugenda.
My son was supposed to be his father.	Umuhungu wanjye yagombaga kuba se.
I was my son's favorite.	Nari umuhungu wanjye yakundaga cyane.
I love it when it does.	Nkunda iyo abikora.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
And he wouldn't have made much money.	Kandi ntabwo yari kubona amafaranga menshi.
It was not always.	Ntabwo byari buri gihe.
But it is very good.	Ariko ni byiza cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
The plan would work.	Gahunda yari gukora.
Walking was difficult.	Kugenda byari bigoye.
Everything is fine.	Ibintu byose ni byiza.
Maybe he is.	Birashoboka ko ari we.
You are saying something.	Urimo kuvuga ikintu.
Well, if you are.	Nibyiza, niba urimo.
I'm not sure what that is.	Sinzi neza ibyo aribyo byose.
Good baby	Umwana mwiza.
I'm glad you're here.	Nishimiye ko uri hano.
John, he is scared.	Yohana, afite ubwoba.
He does everything in his time.	Akora byose mugihe cye.
By now, they had the truth for me.	Kugeza ubu, bari bafite ukuri kuri njye.
It is not your fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa yawe.
But he was gone.	Ariko yari amaze kugenda.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He wasn’t really out there but he wasn’t.	Ntabwo yari hanze rwose ariko ntabwo yari arimo.
He has done well so far.	Yakoze neza kugeza ubu.
He did something really good.	Yakoze ikintu cyiza rwose.
Money, method, must have it.	Amafaranga, uburyo, agomba kuba afite.
And he never had a problem.	Kandi ntabwo yigeze agira ikibazo.
For all of us.	Kuri twese.
They were embarrassed children.	Bari abana bafite isoni.
And he was right about that.	Kandi yari afite ukuri kuri ibyo.
I feel very good.	Numva ari byiza cyane.
He’s a smart guy, and he’s probably good at it.	Ni umusore uzi ubwenge, kandi birashoboka ko ari mwiza.
We don't need anyone.	Ntabwo dukeneye umuntu.
And he is the only one.	Kandi ni we wenyine.
You can't.	Ntushobora.
But there is a big problem.	Ariko hariho ikibazo kinini.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
He doesn't really understand.	Ntabwo yumva rwose.
I just thought of that.	Gusa natekereje kuri ibyo.
She loved being with him.	Yakundaga kubana na we.
A party, a party.	Ibirori, ibirori.
This seems to be difficult, and it is.	Ibi birasa nkaho bigoye, kandi ni.
I can't think.	Sinshobora gutekereza.
I think this is good.	Ndakeka ko ibi ari byiza.
Things are not.	Ibintu ntabwo.
I was very far away.	Nari kure cyane.
He is not a bad person.	Ntabwo ari umuntu mubi.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
Much, much easier.	Byinshi, byoroshye.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
She was happy to see the boy.	Yishimiye kubona umuhungu.
I like this good.	Nkunda ibi byiza.
It was a great day today.	Wari umunsi mwiza uyu munsi.
We need to know what happened.	Tugomba kumenya uko byagenze.
You have a great gift.	Ufite impano nziza.
All of this is good.	Ibi byose ni byiza.
Mary did something.	Mariya yakoze ikintu.
You have great things to do.	Ufite ibintu byiza byo gukora.
He was a young man.	Yari umusore.
Maybe even for him alone.	Ahari no kuri we wenyine.
Or that's what he told me.	Cyangwa nibyo yambwiye.
That's all he agreed to.	Ibyo aribyo byose yemeye byose.
If you are the same thing as me, you are not alone.	Niba uri ikintu kimwe nkanjye, ntabwo uri wenyine.
Tonight it was really good.	Iri joro rwose byari byiza.
Maybe they had a bad day.	Birashoboka ko bari bafite umunsi mubi.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
Just looking for a good time.	Kureba gusa umwanya mwiza.
It will not be easy.	Ntabwo bizaba byoroshye.
That's the problem with him.	Icyo ni ikibazo kuri we.
He doesn't have that.	Ibyo atari afite.
Together.	Hamwe na hamwe.
This is not true.	Ibi ntabwo ari ukuri.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
I enjoyed the kids.	Nishimiye abana.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
With him he is watching.	Hamwe na we arimo kureba.
But she is a beautiful girl below.	Ariko ni umukobwa mwiza munsi.
It's a shame.	Iri ni isoni.
I just know it will be difficult sometimes.	Gusa nzi ko bizaba bigoye rimwe na rimwe.
He can make a lot of mistakes.	Ashobora gukora amakosa menshi.
I don't want to do that.	Ntashaka kubikora.
It was very difficult to see things.	Byari bigoye cyane kubona ibintu.
No one did it.	Nta n'umwe wabikoze.
He can also be a good friend.	Ashobora kandi kuba inshuti nziza.
That's exactly what he did today.	Nibyo rwose nibyo yakoze iki gihe.
And he was not alone.	Kandi ntabwo yari wenyine.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
He asked for help.	Yasabye ubufasha.
He did a lot.	Yakoze cyane.
But that is not all.	Ariko ibyo sibyo rwose.
I really can't.	Sinshobora rwose.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
It's good to find things.	Nibyiza gushaka ibintu.
But that is true.	Ariko ibyo ni ukuri.
A lot of this is obvious.	Ibi byinshi biragaragara.
They are just friends.	Ni inshuti gusa.
I have enough.	Mfite byinshi bihagije.
Something good or something very bad.	Ikintu cyiza cyangwa ikintu kibi cyane.
Neither was it.	Ntabwo na byo byari.
John, go.	Yohana, kugenda.
To do it right.	Kubikora neza.
You are a bad person.	Uri umuntu mubi.
If you have a lot with you.	Niba ufite byinshi hamwe nawe.
In fact, that's not all.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
It was good to win.	Byari byiza gutsinda.
I am a good person.	Ndi umuntu mwiza.
Not just me, but him.	Ntabwo ari njye gusa, na we.
But he had a week.	Ariko yari afite mu cyumweru.
No one knew much about him.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari uzi byinshi kuri we.
That’s a good question for him.	Ni ikibazo cyiza kuri we.
It's really nice to have an idea for it.	Nibyiza rwose kubona igitekerezo kuri yo.
You are beautiful	Uri mwiza.
He does what he wants.	Akora icyo ashaka.
It was something.	Yari ikintu.
Your little girl is so beautiful.	Umukobwa wawe muto muto ni mwiza cyane.
Maybe he is.	Birashoboka ko ari we.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
It's not good, it's just good.	Ntabwo ari byiza, gusa ni byiza.
Normal good things.	Ibintu byiza bisanzwe.
When it's time.	Mugihe ari mugihe cye.
We do not have enough food.	Ntabwo dufite ibiryo bihagije.
To be afraid.	Kugira ubwoba.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
It was here.	Byari hano.
In any case, time is not the same.	Ibyo ari byo byose, igihe ntabwo ari kimwe.
You can't do that there.	Ntushobora kubikora aho.
Nothing so far.	Nta na kimwe kugeza ubu.
I'm not an expert in that.	Ntabwo ndi umuhanga muri byo.
Someone doesn't know.	Umuntu atazi.
I need to know something else.	Nkeneye kumenya ikindi kintu.
Or anything else.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
He was never ashamed.	Ntiyigeze agira isoni.
You are on the phone.	Uri kuri terefone.
Not at all.	Ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I just know what it is now.	Gusa nzi icyo aricyo ubu.
You have to work a lot outside.	Ugomba gukora igihe kinini hanze.
Here it is, now.	Hano ari, ubu.
And that's great.	Kandi ni byiza cyane.
Everything you have to do.	Ibyo ugomba gukora byose.
It's you	Ni wowe.
You can live away from me.	Urashobora kubaho kure yanjye.
He chose not to do so.	Yahisemo kutabikora.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza rwose.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Urashaka kuvuga.
He was a good man.	Yari umuntu mwiza.
But that would not be the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari kuba.
He just needed to see.	Yari akeneye gusa kubona.
The truth is the truth.	Ukuri nukuri.
Quit.	Kureka.
One more thing.	Ikindi kintu kimwe.
He loved the house so much.	Yakundaga inzu cyane.
Please if not.	Nyamuneka niba atari byo.
Maybe he should have heard.	Birashoboka ko yari akwiye kumva.
He had problems.	Yari afite ibibazo.
What do you think.	Ibyo utekereza.
It was a mistake.	Byari amakosa.
He had something good for her.	Yari afite ikintu cyiza kuri we.
But many did.	Ariko benshi ni ko byagenze.
You want to do something else.	Urashaka gukora ikindi kintu.
I love a girl.	Nkunda umukobwa.
She doesn't need to ask for help.	Ntabwo akeneye gusaba ubufasha.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza cyane kubikora gutya.
It was really his idea.	Byari igitekerezo cye rwose.
But here is the problem.	Ariko hano hari ikibazo.
He began to speak.	Yatangiye kuvuga.
He was far away at the time.	Icyo gihe yari kure wenyine.
It was hard for everyone.	Byari bigoye kuri bose.
I can't do it tomorrow.	Sinshobora gukora ejo.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
He saw a lot.	Yabonye byinshi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byaba ari byinshi.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
This is all you do.	Ibi nibyo ukora byose.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva na gato.
There is a walk.	Hariho kugenda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yaba ahari igihe cyose.
The snake is the snake.	Ejo ni ejo.
But he was not alone.	Ariko ntabwo yari wenyine.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
She was terrified.	Yagize ubwoba.
There are many things.	Hariho ibintu byinshi.
He said there was a big deal.	Yavuze ko hari ikintu kinini.
He told me.	Yambwiye.
But no one should go alone.	Ariko nta n'umwe ugomba kugenda wenyine.
I just wasn’t in it.	Gusa sinari ndimo.
Each of us said what we should do.	Buri wese muri twe yavuze icyo tugomba gukora.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
I was sure now.	Nari nzi neza ko ubu.
She likes to walk around a little by herself.	Akunda kugenda hafi gato wenyine.
He was still human.	Yari akiri umuntu.
But he is not the only one.	Ariko si umwe gusa.
I thought about that.	Natekereje kuri ibyo.
Well, not really my wife, not really my wife.	Nibyiza, ntabwo mubyukuri umugore wanjye, ntabwo rwose ari umugore wanjye.
He was not going to back down.	Ntabwo yari agiye gusubira inyuma ye.
And that is not the case.	Kandi ibyo ntabwo aribyo.
For one of us.	Kuri umwe muri twe.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
Bad girl	Umukobwa mubi.
That's not it, either.	Ntabwo aribyo, cyangwa.
I didn't know that.	Sinari nzi hejuru.
He has to be close.	Agomba kuba hafi.
He did not look away.	Ntabwo yarebye kure.
I really enjoyed being here.	Nishimiye rwose kuba hano.
I would take what it is.	Nari gufata icyo aricyo.
He later became a teacher.	Nyuma yaje kuba umwarimu.
He told me exactly what he wanted me to do.	Yambwiye neza icyo yashakaga ko nkora.
We were about to see why.	Twari hafi kureba impamvu.
Almost every day, in fact.	Hafi buri munsi, mubyukuri.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
It wasn't much, but it was enough.	Ntabwo byari byinshi, ariko byari bihagije.
Really something to try.	Mubyukuri ikintu cyo kugerageza.
But for him.	Ariko kuri we.
I enjoyed this program.	Nishimiye iyi gahunda.
And on, and on.	Kandi kuri, no ku.
I wanted to tell everyone tonight.	Nashakaga kubwira abantu bose iri joro.
Too much to see anything.	Byinshi cyane kubona ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I feel it is true for me.	Numva ari ukuri kuri njye.
This is every day.	Ubu ni buri munsi.
In that case, no problem.	Icyo gihe, nta kibazo.
But you can do something about it.	Ariko urashobora kugira icyo ukora.
I want to win.	Ndashaka gutsinda.
Apparently he knows nothing about this.	Biragaragara ko ntacyo azi kuri ibi.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga rwose.
All questions.	Ibibazo byose.
I have a good feeling.	Mfite kumva neza.
We were not a family.	Ntabwo twari umuryango.
I am doing good things.	Ndimo gukora ibintu byiza.
Living with you	Kubana nawe.
You have to get his clothes on.	Ugomba kubona imyenda ye.
That’s not the same problem here.	Ntabwo aricyo kibazo kimwe hano.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
He wanted to get out of here.	Yashakaga kuva hano.
I'm bad here.	Ndi mubi hano.
I want to be close.	Ndashaka kuba hafi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
You can tell me.	Urashobora kumbwira.
But that is not the case.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo.
Sometimes.	Rimwe na rimwe.
I mean really.	Ndashaka kuvuga mubyukuri.
And that would have been nice.	Kandi ibyo birashoboka ko byari byiza.
Only that it will not happen.	Gusa ngo ntabwo bizaba.
All of that.	Ibyo byose.
Not you	Ntabwo ari wowe.
I'm not good.	Ntabwo ndi mwiza.
You have to look.	Ugomba kureba.
I was alone.	Nari wenyine.
It was a problem getting things done.	Byari ikibazo kubona ibintu.
That sounds good.	Ibyo birasa neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
It would not be good.	Ntabwo yari kuba mwiza.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He did not want to be with her.	Ntiyashakaga kubana na we.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Too much to be a child.	Kinini cyane kuba umwana.
I wanted to.	Nashakaga.
But we can be many.	Ariko dushobora kuba benshi.
It's one of the only racing games I play.	Ni ikintu kimwe muri benshi.
It wasn't good, either.	Ntabwo byari byiza, kimwe muri byo.
He should have known by now.	Yari akwiye kumenya kugeza ubu.
He told me to find a new friend.	Yambwiye gushaka inshuti nshya.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
I knew he had to be scared.	Nari nzi ko agomba no kugira ubwoba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
And definitely not at home.	Kandi rwose ntabwo ari murugo.
Early.	Kugira kare.
He said he was not his dog.	Yavuze ko atari imbwa ye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko muri iki gihe nta kintu na kimwe.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
You are an expert, not me.	Uri umuhanga, ntabwo ari njye.
He really wanted to.	Yashakaga rwose.
This is sometimes true.	Ibi rimwe na rimwe ni ukuri.
In fact, he never thought much of it.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo yigeze atekereza cyane kuri byo.
He spoke quickly and quickly.	Yavuze vuba kandi vuba.
You don’t have to look in front of him.	Ntugomba kureba imbere ye.
He is.	Ni we.
He chose the last place.	Yahisemo umwanya wa nyuma.
This was easy.	Ibi byari byoroshye.
That is especially true.	Iyo cyane cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
I need someone inside.	Nkeneye umuntu imbere.
The truth is good but not good.	Ukuri nibyiza ariko ntabwo ari byiza.
One day, he was alone in the house with her.	Umunsi umwe, yari wenyine mu nzu hamwe na we.
Since then everything has been down.	Kuva icyo gihe byose byari hasi.
Well, at least he didn't go down without explaining himself first.	Nibyo, yashoboraga kubana nibyo.
Lots of catch.	Byinshi byo gufata.
He had a job.	Yari afite akazi.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
But that is not true.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo ari ukuri.
You may think we are out here.	Urashobora gutekereza ko turi hanze aha.
Things you said.	Ibintu wavuze.
I didn't see it.	Ntabwo nabonye.
He wanted to know everything.	Yashakaga kumenya byose.
I do not mean to say that there is nothing wrong with that.	Ntashaka kuvuga ko nta kibi.
He was in the room.	Yari mu cyumba.
We all need people.	Twese dukeneye abantu.
The filmmaker first heard.	Umukinnyi wa firime yumva bwa mbere.
He knew my whole family.	Yari azi umuryango wanjye wose.
Sometimes, no.	Rimwe na rimwe, nta.
And it's really good.	Kandi ni byiza rwose.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
You have to go dog.	Ugomba kugenda imbwa.
In fact, that's not all.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
I was out.	Nari hanze.
You can win tomorrow.	Urashobora gutsinda ejo.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
He is young.	Ari muto.
It just looks like.	Birasa gusa.
He never looked.	Ntiyigeze asa.
As long as we can do it.	Kugeza igihe dushobora kubikora.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
All the best.	Ibintu byiza byose.
You know what to do.	Uzi icyo ugomba gukora.
What do you think?	Uratekereza iki?.
I didn't think much of it.	Ntabwo natekerezaga neza.
He had to.	Yagombaga.
I mean, really.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri.
And above, he talks about time.	Kandi hejuru aha, avuga igihe.
This time he wants to talk.	Iki gihe arashaka kuvuga.
He did not want to hear the truth.	Ntiyashakaga kumva ukuri.
No sense in telling you now - I don't wanna ruin the suprise.	Nta ubwenge.
'he says.	' avuga.
We are a close family.	Turi umuryango wa hafi.
He was upstairs.	Yari hejuru.
You have to.	Ugomba.
I like cars.	Nkunda imodoka.
In fact, you should.	Mubyukuri, ugomba.
They are not his people, they are not.	Ntabwo ari abantu be, nta n'umwe.
He knew everything.	Yari azi byose.
And you.	Kandi nawe.
They are human beings.	Ni abantu.
That will be fine.	Ibyo bizaba byiza.
You can't stop.	Ntushobora guhagarika.
This is a great opportunity.	Ibi ni amahirwe cyane.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
All of this sounds good.	Ibi byose birasa neza.
I was well aware of this.	Nari nzi neza iki kintu.
In this world.	Kuri iyi si.
Or he can come here.	Cyangwa arashobora kuza hano.
I ask the same question.	Ndabaza ikibazo kimwe.
I have people to see.	Mfite abantu kubona.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
There is a movie here.	Hano hari firime.
It was good for me.	Byari byiza kuri njye.
One thing he tried.	Ikintu kimwe yagerageje.
It was not very good.	Ntiyari mwiza cyane.
You have to believe it to be true.	Ugomba kwizera ko ari ukuri.
You can never tell the truth.	Ntushobora na rimwe kuvuga ukuri.
He didn't need to drink.	Ntiyari akeneye kunywa.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
That's just fine.	Nibyiza gusa.
He is absolutely genius.	Ni umuhanga rwose.
But no.	Ariko nta.
No one said anything.	Nta muntu wavuze ikintu.
No problem.	Nta kibazo urimo.
We had no idea.	Ntabwo twari dufite igitekerezo.
I know people that easy.	Nzi abantu ibyo byoroshye.
Her beautiful hair.	Umusatsi we mwiza.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
You can do it now.	Urashobora kubikora ubu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
Too bad to wait.	Gutegereza nabi cyane.
Today is not a good day.	Uyu munsi ntabwo ari umunsi mwiza.
None of this is good.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo ari cyiza.
We don't need much.	Ntabwo dukeneye byinshi.
But for now, that is all.	Ariko kuri ubu, ibyo aribyo byose.
And you actually do everything.	Kandi mubyukuri ukora ibintu byose.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
I think about all this.	Ndatekereza cyane kuri ibi byose.
Maybe you should go.	Birashoboka ko ugomba kugenda.
There is only one thing wrong with him.	Gusa hari ikintu kimwe kibi kuri we.
Probably not many.	Birashoboka ko atari benshi.
We have a bus schedule.	Dufite gahunda ya bisi.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I saw something.	Nabonye ikintu.
That's not really the case.	Ibyo ntabwo aribyo rwose.
And it's really good.	Kandi ni mwiza rwose.
Maybe he should go.	Birashoboka ko agomba kugenda.
We are a little behind.	Turi inyuma gato.
All of this was great.	Ibi byose byari byiza.
He knew he could never walk.	Yari azi ko adashobora na rimwe kugenda.
Good on you.	Nibyiza kuri ibi.
He is human.	Ari umuntu.
I think we can play a lot.	Ndatekereza ko dushobora gukina cyane.
Someone had to do it and he was.	Umuntu yagombaga kubikora kandi ni we.
He was very human.	Yari umuntu cyane.
I thought.	Natekereje.
I needed to see that person.	Nari nkeneye kubona uwo muntu.
He may not do so.	Ashobora kutabikora.
He loved everyone.	Yakundaga abantu bose.
But there is no reason to say that.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo kuvuga ibyo.
And they were right.	Kandi bari bafite ukuri.
He was very worried that this was not the case.	Yari afite impungenge nyinshi ko atari byo.
But it is your whole family.	Ariko ni umuryango wawe wose.
We had nothing.	Nta na kimwe twari dufite.
Apparently it was a mistake.	Biragaragara ko ari amakosa.
Snake.	Ejo.
At the time he was dressed.	Icyo gihe yari yambaye.
They are obviously scared.	Biragaragara ko bafite ubwoba.
And sometimes it happens.	Kandi rimwe na rimwe byagenze.
However, this is not the case.	Ariko, ibi ntabwo aribyo.
But he was no longer one.	Ariko ntiyari akiri umuntu umwe.
At all times, in fact.	Igihe cyose, mubyukuri.
You know what that thing is.	Uzi icyo kintu icyo aricyo.
But then, he started walking in her.	Ariko nyuma, yatangiye kugenda muri we.
That's right- this is me.	Nibyo, ni njye.
He is ready for all that.	Yiteguye kuri ibyo byose.
You were going to hear.	Wari ugiye kumva.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
I think he knows what to do.	Ntekereza ko azi icyo gukora.
He told me once.	Yambwiye rimwe.
He took his time.	Yafashe igihe cye.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Yavuze ko ibyo atari ukuri.
Nothing wrong.	Nta kibi rwose.
But he always knew what he wanted.	Ariko igihe cyose yari azi icyo ashaka.
I did not know.	Sinari nzi.
It's not normal.	Ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
For us, that is not the case.	Kuri twe, ntabwo aribyo.
I don't want to do it again.	Sinshaka kongera kubikora.
We were here before.	Twari hano mbere.
He is a very good boy.	Ni umuhungu mwiza cyane.
Same thing with the movie.	Ikintu kimwe na firime.
It's good enough.	Ni mwiza bihagije.
One was alone.	Umwe yari wenyine.
That's what I saw before.	Nibyo nabonye mbere.
A lot of things to look at.	Ibintu byinshi byo kureba.
But it is not in front of me.	Ariko ntabwo ari imbere yanjye.
He speaks well.	Avuga neza.
This is his first book.	Iyi ni igitabo cye cya mbere.
He really has nothing.	Mubyukuri ntacyo afite.
You are taking.	Urimo gufata.
That was very close.	Ibyo byari hafi cyane.
It's a good thing.	Ni ikintu cyiza.
There is one small problem.	Hariho ikibazo kimwe gito.
But there are so many people.	Ariko hariho abantu benshi cyane.
But you should try to increase your chances.	Ariko ugomba kugerageza kongera amahirwe yawe.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
Nor can we say that letting go of things.	Ntidushobora kandi kuvuga ko kureka ibintu.
He knew he would do it.	Yari azi ko azabikora.
We don't have to go.	Ntabwo dufite kugenda.
But there is no need to wait.	Ariko nta mpamvu yo gutegereza.
Everyone knows the plan so far.	Abantu bose bazi gahunda kugeza ubu.
I thought so too.	Nanjye natekereje.
But he can really do it all.	Ariko arashobora rwose kubikora byose.
He had a job to do.	Yari afite akazi ko gukora.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
He asked why.	Yabajije impamvu.
After eating.	Nyuma yo kurya.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
It's just a school.	Ni ishuri gusa.
'.	'.
He had a lot to say.	Yari afite byinshi byo kuvuga.
'	'
Probably.	Birashoboka.
Children.	Abana.
But everything is true.	Ariko byose ni ukuri.
We didn’t have much to do.	Ntabwo twari dufite byinshi byo gukora.
He was not going to do anything.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari agiye gukora.
You are not alone.	Ntabwo ari wowe wenyine.
There are a lot of people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi.
I have money.	Mfite amafaranga.
He never did.	Ntiyigeze abikora.
This is a good thing.	Iki ni ikintu cyiza.
This is not a good thing.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza cyane.
But, you have to stay.	Ariko, ugomba kuguma.
There are ways to do that.	Hariho uburyo bwo kubikora.
I want to study.	Ndashaka kwiga.
I am a boy.	Ndi umuhungu.
To.	Kuri.
It was easy.	Byari ibintu byoroshye.
Looks like he's not.	Birasa nkaho atari.
You can drive every day.	Urashobora gutwara buri munsi.
I didn't see the girl.	Ntabwo nabonye umukobwa.
I thought you were.	Natekereje ko wowe.
I'm really sorry.	Mbabajwe rwose nibyo.
Now here.	Ubu ni hano.
I didn't get the idea.	Ntabwo nabonye igitekerezo.
He knew where to go.	Yari azi aho agomba kujya.
But that was not the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari ukuri rwose.
The first thing.	Ikintu cya mbere.
It's good for me.	Ni mwiza kuri njye.
I just don't know what to think.	Gusa sinzi icyo ntekereza.
You can't do that.	Ntushobora kubikora.
He wanted to know people.	Yashakaga kumenya abantu.
I am only one day old, and.	Ndi umunsi umwe gusa, kandi.
And that was true at the time.	Kandi ibyo byari ukuri icyo gihe.
He had no problem.	Nta kibazo na kimwe yari afite.
But it is not money.	Ariko ntabwo ari amafaranga.
He was probably in it.	Birashoboka ko yari arimo.
Good things.	Ibintu byiza.
Sometimes there are years in that thing.	Rimwe na rimwe hari imyaka muri icyo kintu.
You have to wait here.	Ugomba gutegereza hano.
I can't say another time.	Ntabwo nshobora kuvuga ikindi gihe.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
That's not what I believe.	Ntabwo aribyo nizera.
Feeling good about yourself.	Kumva neza umuntu.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
In fact, this time around.	Mubyukuri, iki gihe.
He didn’t want to, but he had to.	Ntiyashakaga, ariko yagombaga.
I do the same with my phone.	Nkora kimwe na terefone yanjye.
As she was a girl.	Nkuko yari umukobwa.
I need to know what happened.	Nkeneye kumenya uko byagenze.
I feel as much as possible.	Ndumva byinshi bishoboka cyane.
Maybe upstairs.	Ahari hejuru.
And if there is a child.	Niba kandi hari umwana.
He didn't have time to do anything else.	Ntabwo yari afite umwanya wo gukora ikindi kintu cyose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
But he is swimming.	Ariko arimo koga.
But, but.	Ariko, ariko.
or.	cyangwa.
But if it worked out well.	Ariko niba byagenze neza.
He has to be here, really here.	Agomba kuba hano, hano rwose.
It was always around me.	Buri gihe byari hafi yanjye.
I don't know how to try.	Ntabwo nzi kugerageza.
He didn't know why now.	Ntiyari azi impamvu ubu.
I'm glad to do that.	Nishimiye kubikora.
This is true.	Iki ni ukuri.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose yari azi neza.
Both today.	Bombi muri iki gihe.
He must have had help.	Agomba kuba yari afite ubufasha.
We have to go far.	Tugomba kujya kure.
Always in the morning.	Buri gihe mu gitondo.
He was my friend.	Yari inshuti yanjye.
Much is clear.	Byinshi biragaragara.
I don’t know if we can win.	Sinzi niba dushobora gutsinda.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I also like to eat.	Nkunda kandi kurya.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
We. 	Ni.
'	'
I feel bad all day.	Numva ari mubi umunsi wose.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
He told me everything.	Yambwiye byose.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
He knew who he was.	Yari azi uwo ari we.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
He did not know what it was.	Ntabwo yari azi icyo aricyo.
He was worried, he could see.	Yari afite impungenge, yashoboraga kubona.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either.	Nibyo, byari byiza cyane.
He wanted more for her.	Yashakaga byinshi kuri we.
I never worked here.	Ntabwo nigeze nkora hano.
Shame! 	Isoni!
Do you have any ideas on how to do this?	Ufite igitekerezo cyo kubikora?.
At the time, I didn't think much of it.	Icyo gihe ntabwo natekerezaga cyane.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ubu ni uburyo, ntabwo ari ibintu.
The advice you have so far is good.	Inama ufite kugeza ubu ni nziza.
So far it is only on my phone.	Kugeza ubu ni muri terefone yanjye gusa.
Father's son.	Umuhungu wa se.
If that is possible.	Niba ibyo bishoboka.
But the girl was not alone.	Ariko umukobwa ntiyari wenyine.
He also heard something else.	Yumvise kandi ikindi kintu.
At that time the money was not large.	Icyo gihe amafaranga ntiyari menshi.
And very good.	Kandi nziza cyane.
He really did.	Yakoze rwose.
He didn't want to go.	Ntiyashakaga kujyana.
He didn't want to think about anything else.	Ntiyashakaga gutekereza ikindi.
You are not sure what that is.	Ntabwo uzi neza uko ibyo aribyo.
But I think we have time.	Ntekereza ariko ko dufite igihe.
All would be well.	Byose byaba byiza.
That's a lot.	Ibyo ni byinshi.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
I have to win.	Ngomba gutsinda.
They are all scared.	Bose bafite ubwoba.
He did not want to drink alone.	Ntiyashakaga kunywa wenyine.
I had his family on the phone.	Nari mfite umuryango we kuri terefone.
He needed a job.	Yari akeneye akazi.
This is a family.	Uyu ni umuryango.
One had to trust someone.	Umuntu yagombaga kwizera umuntu.
We need more.	Dukeneye ibintu byinshi.
You have to live well.	Ugomba kubana neza.
I may have more.	Nshobora kuba mfite byinshi.
It's all up to you.	Byose niwowe.
Too much to say is another thing.	Kuvuga byinshi ni ikindi kintu.
That was good enough for me.	Ibyo byari byiza bihagije kuri njye.
And we can't have that.	Kandi ntidushobora kugira ibyo.
Everyone here is friends.	Abantu bose hano ni inshuti.
Since then	Kuva icyo gihe.
I really don't have a plan.	Ntabwo rwose mfite gahunda.
Why should we come here.	Kuki tugomba kuza hano.
He did not understand why.	Ntiyigeze yumva neza impamvu.
You need each one.	Ukeneye buri.
No one knew.	Nta muntu n'umwe yari azi.
It's scary.	Ni ubwoba.
That was enough.	Byari bihagije.
You have to do it all.	Ugomba kubikora byose.
And he probably tried harder, too.	Kandi birashoboka ko yagerageje cyane, kandi.
I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva.
And in fact, it is.	Kandi mubyukuri, nibyo.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, yamaze kubikora.
I saw nothing.	Ntacyo nabonye.
I want to think that it happened.	Ndashaka gutekereza ko byagenze.
He is not doing well.	Ntabwo akora neza.
You can go.	Urashobora kugenda.
I was scared.	Nari mfite ubwoba.
He said he could see more later.	Yavuze ko ashobora kubona byinshi nyuma.
And he has to be.	Kandi agomba kuba.
He has something to say.	Hari icyo avuga.
And that’s an idea.	Kandi ni igitekerezo.
Not today.	Ntabwo ari uyu munsi.
We can't stop now.	Ntidushobora kureka ubu.
And that's not the case.	Kandi ntabwo aribyo.
Either way, that’s enough for me.	Ibyo ari byo byose, bihagije kuri njye.
But he was ready.	Ariko yari yiteguye.
We have to work now.	Tugomba gukora ubu.
Before it was his house it was your house.	Mbere yari inzu ye yari inzu yawe.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
He was right.	Yari afite ukuri.
I actually got a new car yesterday.	Mubyukuri nabonye imodoka nshya ejo.
He expected more.	Yari yiteze ko hari byinshi.
A really talented guy.	Umusore ufite impano rwose.
Soon he will be a good thing.	Vuba aha azaba ikintu cyiza.
Her son was here.	Umuhungu we yari hano.
You're talking about a guy who can stop.	Urimo kuvuga umusore ushobora guhagarika.
It was not normal.	Ntabwo byari bisanzwe.
This was a really good thing.	Ibi byari ibintu byiza rwose.
He began to think about quitting.	Yatangiye gutekereza kureka.
It's not his money.	Ntabwo ari amafaranga ye.
Probably a player or a person.	Birashoboka ko ari umukinnyi cyangwa umuntu.
Not all of them.	Ntabwo ari bose.
He only went to one.	Yagiye gusa kuri umwe.
He says I have to eat.	Avuga ko ngomba kurya.
I wanted to get out.	Nashakaga kuva hanze.
You are not	Wowe ntabwo.
I feel nothing.	Ntacyo numva.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
By phone.	Terefone.
I think that would be nice and nice.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byaba byiza kandi byiza.
That would be enough.	Byaba bihagije.
There are a lot of people here.	Hano hari abantu benshi.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
I don’t want him to go.	Sinshaka ko agenda.
But that's not all.	Ariko ntabwo aribyo byose.
So far, so good.	Kugeza ubu, ni byiza.
Mostly, it is possible.	Byinshi, birashoboka.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
We need something else.	Dukeneye ikindi kintu.
It was not difficult before.	Ntabwo byari bigoye mbere.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
This is especially true if possible.	Ibi birashoboka cyane cyane, niba bishoboka.
He was upstairs.	Yari hejuru.
It would be a nice and nice thing to do.	Byaba ikintu cyiza kandi cyiza cyo gukora.
He is a young man.	Ni umusore muto.
You can say a lot.	Urashobora kuvuga byinshi.
I've never seen someone act like that before.	Sinigeze mbona umuntu ukora nka we mbere.
He started talking to me.	Yatangiye kuvugana nanjye.
Not in time.	Ntabwo ari mugihe.
This is especially true if you have a family.	Ibi ni ukuri cyane niba ufite umuryango.
None of this he did.	Nta na kimwe muri ibyo yakoze.
Things went well for us.	Ibintu byagenze neza kuri twe.
You are my best friend	Uri inshuti nkunda cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari bigoye gukora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
It's good to know that it's not my fault.	Nibyiza kumenya ko atari amakosa yanjye.
Just me	Ni njye gusa.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
I can't go.	Sinshobora kugenda.
I like to do it.	Nkunda kubikora.
I know someone in prison right now.	Nzi umuntu uri muri gereza nonaha.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He chose however.	Yahisemo ariko.
Not much to go by.	Ntabwo ari byinshi byo kujyana.
He is.	Niwe .
Not really.	Mubyukuri sibyo.
He agreed to stay.	Yemeye kuguma.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
He wanted to say more.	Yashakaga kuvuga byinshi.
But that was not the case.	Ariko ntabwo byari byagenze rwose.
I have to.	Ninjye ugomba.
I have a job.	Mfite akazi.
This is the person.	Uyu ni uwo muntu.
Very out of place.	Hanze cyane.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Sinzi neza niba aribyo.
Or better yet.	Cyangwa nibyiza.
He knew full well.	Yari azi neza.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
Knowing that something is very wrong.	Kumenya ko hari ikintu kibi cyane.
No one had seen him leave.	Nta muntu n'umwe wari wabonye agenda.
He was out here.	Yari hanze aha.
I didn't see anything for the first time.	Ntacyo nabonye bwa mbere.
The young man took it fast.	Umusore muto yafashe vuba.
It was really good.	Byari byiza rwose.
I just knew.	Nari nzi gusa.
You can't think of a better way.	Ntushobora gutekereza ko ari byiza.
It was all up to me.	Byose byari kuri njye.
It’s not when he was around.	Ntabwo ari igihe yari hafi.
That's not really the case.	Mubyukuri ntabwo aribyo.
He was not in the house.	Ntabwo yari mu nzu.
He did not know what to expect.	Ntiyari azi icyo yari yiteze kubona.
But is that true ?.	Ariko ibyo ni ukuri?.
In prison.	Muri gereza.
We have to go.	Tugomba kugenda.
Let go of that.	Kureka ibyo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You have one child.	Ufite umwana umwe.
The car started moving.	Imodoka yatangiye kugenda.
But that is not all.	Ariko sibyo rwose.
And this is my house.	Kandi iyi ni yo nzu yanjye.
For everything.	Kuri buri kintu cyose.
I want to be in that house.	Ndashaka kuba muri iyo nzu.
Things are really easy.	Ibintu byoroshye rwose.
I would hear anything anyone said.	Nari kumva ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose umuntu wese yavuze.
I don't want to eat.	Sinshaka kurya.
Very good, really.	Byiza cyane, mubyukuri.
He just wants to be close to her.	Ashaka gusa kuba hafi ye.
This is not the case now.	Ubu sibyo.
.	.
Help.	Ubufasha.
But you have to look.	Ariko ugomba kureba.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
I doubt it.	Ndashidikanya.
Each problem.	Buri kibazo.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
We had no idea what to expect.	Ntabwo twari dufite igitekerezo cyo gutegereza.
I think that was a mistake.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari amakosa.
I don't know how you did it.	Sinzi uko wabikoze.
And you can't get out of here.	Kandi ntushobora kuva hano.
Today was a good day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza.
Maybe not, but maybe.	Birashoboka ko atari byo, ariko birashoboka.
Everything was great.	Ibintu byose byari byiza cyane.
If it is good.	Niba ari byiza.
It just wasn’t.	Gusa ntabwo yari.
I want to do more and learn more.	Ndashaka gukora byinshi no kwiga byinshi.
I wanted to see all this.	Nashakaga kubona ibi byose.
He was my friend.	Yari inshuti yanjye.
He said he wanted the truth.	Yavuze ko ashaka ukuri.
Everyone was upstairs.	Abantu bose bari hejuru.
He was not sure if he had done so.	Ntabwo yari azi neza ko yabikoze.
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
But that is good.	Ariko ibyo ni byiza.
He is smart.	Afite ubwenge.
That's good for us.	Nibyiza kuri twe.
I almost did the same.	Nanjye hafi yabikoze.
But he knew where he was.	Ariko yari azi aho ari.
He is.	Niwe.
He can’t believe his luck.	Ntashobora kwizera amahirwe ye.
You have to be a good dog.	Ugomba kuba imbwa nziza.
He made problems.	Yakoze ibibazo.
And he seemed to know a lot.	Kandi yasaga naho azi byinshi.
He saw it as an opportunity.	Yabonye ko ari amahirwe.
He knew he had to.	Yari azi ko agomba.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
If you have questions, tell me.	Niba ufite ibibazo, mbwira.
I thought.	Natekereje.
He would know what to do.	Yari kumenya icyo gukora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
But there was one thing he could do.	Ariko hariho ikintu kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
There is a lot to eat and drink here.	Hano hari byinshi byo kurya no kunywa.
I just thought you needed help or something.	Gusa natekereje ko ukeneye ubufasha cyangwa ikindi kintu.
He never had a problem getting what he wanted.	Ntiyigeze agira ikibazo cyo kubona ibintu yashakaga.
I never saw it, I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona, nigeze mbona.
Is he a young man ?.	Ari umusore?.
But you have to believe that you are.	Ariko ugomba kwizera ko uri.
Now he can.	Ubu arashobora.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo ari byo byose, byari byiza nyuma.
He has one thing or another.	Afite ikintu cyangwa ikindi.
You have no way of knowing this.	Ntabwo ufite uburyo bwo kumenya ko ibi.
Tell me everything	Mbwira byose.
I was in his room.	Nari mu cyumba cye.
He didn't want anything.	Nta na kimwe yashakaga.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
I want to play again.	Ndashaka gusubira gukina mbere.
There are so many of us.	Hariho benshi cyane muri twe.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko na we yabikoze.
I am everything.	Ndi byose.
Maybe he shouldn't be out here.	Birashoboka ko atagomba kuba hanze aha.
You didn't see it.	Ntabwo wabonye.
It is something that anyone can learn.	Ni ikintu umuntu wese ashobora kwiga.
I want to go home.	Ndashaka gutaha.
It was just good to do it.	Byari byiza gusa kubikora.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko yabikoze.
He started working.	Yatangiye gukora.
However, it is not.	Ariko, sibyo.
Now it is not good.	Ubu ntabwo ari mwiza.
I didn't think so.	Sinatekerezaga ko aribyo.
I thought it was good.	Natekereje ko byari byiza.
And when he came, he came quickly.	Kandi iyo yaje, yaje vuba.
It was a great day.	Wari umunsi mwiza.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
He said what he said.	Yavuze ibyo yavuze.
He probably wanted to help.	Birashoboka ko yashakaga gufasha.
I was not here.	Sinari hano.
We are human.	Turi abantu.
And here we are.	Kandi turi hano.
No need to talk.	Nta mpamvu yo kuvuga.
He has a house here.	Afite inzu hano.
I like this question.	Nkunda iki kibazo.
But you are scared.	Ariko ufite ubwoba.
But he too would come.	Ariko na we yari kuza.
He wanted to go back.	Yashakaga gusubira inyuma.
Nothing could have worked better.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora neza.
And he probably didn't.	Kandi birashoboka ko atabikoze.
Everything will be fine.	Byose bizaba byiza.
This was very true.	Ibi byari ukuri no hejuru cyane.
He was expecting all this.	Yari yiteze ibyo byose.
We have no time.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya.
You can do it well.	Urashobora nawe neza.
It was true enough.	Byari ukuri bihagije.
Probably something else.	Birashoboka ko ari ikindi kintu.
Good luck.	Amahirwe wabonye.
Not when you are thirty years old.	Ntabwo iyo ufite imyaka mirongo itatu.
But I'm glad to go.	Ariko nishimiye kugenda.
For him it was not.	Kuri we ntabwo yari.
They are gifted or very lucky.	Bafite impano cyangwa bafite amahirwe menshi.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
But you did.	Ariko wabikoze.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
I have to stop.	Ngomba guhagarika.
Another little thing.	Ikindi kintu gito.
You can't find friends.	Ntushobora kubona inshuti.
I think he was good.	Ndakeka ko yari mwiza.
We are not here at all.	Ntabwo turi hano rwose.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
He wanted to be there.	Yashakaga kuba ahari.
He told me what he wanted to do.	Yambwiye icyo yashakaga gukora.
You have to go back to school tomorrow.	Ugomba gusubira ku ishuri ejo.
It would be nice.	Byaba byiza.
However, he did not need it.	Ariko, ntiyari akeneye.
It is very good and good.	Nibyiza cyane kandi byiza.
Maybe tomorrow we can go. 	Birashoboka ko ejo dushobora kugenda.
'	'
He works as before.	Akora nka mbere.
I knew a lot about him.	Nari nzi byinshi kuri we.
And something.	Kandi ikintu.
He wanted to know what happened.	Yashakaga kumenya uko byagenze.
He thought badly.	Yatekereje nabi.
Most of it was luck.	Byinshi muri byo byari amahirwe.
He had help.	Yari afite ubufasha.
You have your son.	Ufite umuhungu wawe.
Like a prison.	Nka gereza.
That everything was real.	Ko ibintu byose byari mubyukuri.
He worked hard on this.	Yakoze cyane kuri ibi.
Maybe we are.	Birashoboka ko turi.
Or anyone who claims to be a friend.	Cyangwa umuntu wese wavuze ko ari inshuti.
He had everything.	Ibyo yari afite byose.
I think this was great.	Ntekereza ko ibi byari byiza cyane.
He had a lot.	Yari afite byinshi.
She seemed to be together.	Yasaga nkaho afite hamwe.
But not really.	Ariko ntabwo mubyukuri.
This is very likely.	Ibi birashoboka cyane.
I have a job to do.	Mfite akazi ko gukora.
No problem tonight.	Nta kibazo muri iri joro.
This one.	Uyu.
This one is bad.	Uyu ukora nabi.
You can't do everything.	Ntushobora gukora byose.
I didn't want to be with him.	Sinifuzaga kubana nanjye.
I really want to.	Ndashaka rwose.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, ntabwo aribyo rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo.
But he did not want to go fast.	Ariko ntiyashakaga kugenda vuba.
I got it right so far.	Nabonye neza kugeza aho.
As before, it eventually came to fruition.	Kimwe na mbere, amaherezo yaje gukora.
That is absolutely possible.	Ibyo birashoboka rwose.
He wants what he wants.	Arashaka ko ashaka iki.
I really did.	Nakoze rwose.
He used to get married.	Yakundaga gushaka.
He had no one.	Nta muntu yari afite.
But he was probably the only one.	Ariko birashoboka ko uwo yari we wenyine.
You have a gift.	Ufite impano.
She began to feel scared.	Yatangiye kumva afite ubwoba.
And he was my child.	Kandi yari umwana wanjye.
I'm glad to be there.	Nishimiye kuba ahari.
But you saw.	Ariko wabonye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He had nothing.	Nta na kimwe yari afite.
We can't stay there.	Ntidushobora kuguma aho.
This is a day to reflect on.	Uyu ni umunsi wo gutekereza neza.
I wanted to go to school.	Nashakaga kujya ku ishuri.
From that room to this.	Kuva muri icyo cyumba kugeza kuri iki.
Tell me.	Mbwira.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
This will be the same.	Ibi bizaba kimwe.
He got to work now.	Yabonye gukora ubu.
However, you cannot drive.	Ariko, ntushobora gutwara imodoka.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari ukuri.
He thinks he's ready.	Yibwira ko yiteguye.
After all, one has to do it.	Nyuma ya byose, umuntu agomba kubikora.
I don't think you have to.	Ntabwo ntekereza ko ugomba kubikora.
In his house.	Mu nzu ye.
Let go of the phone.	Kureka terefone.
Woman.	Umugore.
But that was exactly what he needed.	Ariko ibyo nibyo yari akeneye byose.
That was a man.	Uwo yari umuntu.
I want to be.	Ndashaka kuba.
You have to have someone.	Ugomba kugira umuntu.
It's the same thing.	Ni ikintu kimwe.
There is something that one can do.	Hariho ikintu umuntu ashobora gukora.
Today and every day.	Uyu munsi na buri munsi.
Inside this house.	Imbere muri iyi nzu.
He didn't need the money.	Ntabwo yari akeneye amafaranga.
And he is a good friend.	Kandi ni inshuti nziza.
There are so many.	Hariho benshi cyane.
Living in fear.	Kubaho ufite ubwoba.
I ask closely.	Ndabaza hafi.
It was not very possible.	Ntabwo byari bishoboka cyane.
There is something wrong with everything.	Hariho ikintu kibi kuri buri kintu.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
Where were we 	Twari he?
.	.
Something nice and nice.	Ikintu cyiza kandi cyiza.
He has a plan.	Afite gahunda.
You know what to do.	Uzi icyo ugomba gukora.
That's what happened then.	Kuva icyo gihe ni ko byagenze.
So far.	Kugeza ubu.
He did it on his own.	Yabikoze wenyine wenyine.
He tried to get help.	Yagerageje kubona ubufasha.
It is neither now nor ever.	Ntabwo ari ubu cyangwa nta na rimwe.
I have a lot to do.	Mfite byinshi byo gukora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He says nothing.	Nta cyo avuga.
He thought it was good.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza.
He once thought he had seen a lot.	Yigeze gutekereza ko yabonye byinshi.
It was really great.	Mubyukuri byari byiza cyane.
Of course, all of this was normal.	Nibyo, ibi byose byari bisanzwe.
You have no top.	Ntabwo ufite hejuru.
He really has to go.	Agomba rwose kugenda.
This was not an easy task.	Ibi ntabwo byari ibintu byoroshye.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
I think you are one.	Ntekereza ko uri umwe.
He was a bad person to me.	Yari umuntu mubi kuri njye.
As long as he wants to do it.	Igihe cyose aricyo ashaka gukora.
There is a problem though.	Hariho ikibazo naho.
I think that's what you want.	Ntekereza ko aricyo ushaka.
I hope you like staying here.	Nizere ko ukunda kuguma hano.
He didn't want to hear anything.	Ntiyashakaga kumva ikintu na kimwe.
He loved it so much.	Yakundaga cyane.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi icyo gukora.
I do the same.	Nkora kimwe.
They have no job.	Nta kazi bafite.
You are here.	Uri hano.
He probably didn't mean it.	Ntabwo bishoboka ko yashakaga kuvuga.
It is not a good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza.
He did not know anyone who had a child.	Ntabwo yari azi umuntu ufite umwana.
And that's great.	Kandi ibyo ni byiza cyane.
Probably you.	Birashoboka ko ari wowe.
I don't want to see much.	Sinshaka kubona byinshi.
He thought it was time.	Yatekereje ko ari igihe.
He could only wait.	Yashoboraga gutegereza gusa.
He was right.	Yavuze neza.
They are not human beings.	Ntabwo ari abantu.
He would not say.	Ntiyari kuvuga.
But that is not what you need.	Ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo ukeneye.
It is not one of the easiest.	Ntabwo ari kimwe mu byoroshye.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
I hope it's good with you.	Nizere ko ari byiza nawe.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
And whatever you think, you can do.	Kandi ibyo utekereza byose, urashobora gukora.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Here are all the things you need to know.	Hano hari ibintu byose ugomba kumenya.
I can't do this.	Ibi ntashobora gukora.
I believe it is true.	Nizera ko ari ukuri.
.	.
You know a lot.	Ibyo uzi byinshi.
And well! 	Kandi neza!
Maybe you should consider eating here.	Birashoboka ko ugomba gutekereza kurya hano.
Everyone has one.	Umuntu wese afite umwe.
I know how to be alone.	Nzi uburyo ugomba kuba wenyine.
It's clear.	Biragaragara neza.
An idea is an idea.	Igitekerezo ni igitekerezo.
You are not alone.	Ntabwo nawe uri wenyine.
And indeed they were.	Kandi rwose bari.
But reading was good.	Ariko gusoma byari byiza.
Just for fun.	Kuri gusa.
It was always good.	Buri gihe byari byiza.
But all was well.	Ariko byose byari byiza.
One, obviously it was time.	Umwe, biragaragara ko yari igihe.
Probably not.	Birashoboka ko atari ukuri.
He really needs time.	Akeneye rwose umwanya.
He knows when he is good.	Azi igihe ari mwiza.
It would have been easy enough, he had thought.	Byaba byoroshye bihagije, yari yatekereje.
But they were right about the house.	Ariko bari bafite ukuri ku nzu.
He seems to be alone.	Asa naho ari wenyine.
If so.	Niba aribyo.
Only one person can have anything.	Umuntu umwe gusa arashobora kugira ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
I was scared too.	Nanjye nagize ubwoba.
He chose to return to work.	Yahisemo gusubira ku kazi.
He thought hard.	Yatekerezaga cyane.
Trying to survive.	Kugerageza kubaho.
Not really.	Ntabwo rwose aribyo.
I thought about it all.	Natekereje byose.
You were just a kid.	Wari umwana gusa.
But all would be well.	Ariko byose byari kuba byiza.
And he is alone.	Kandi ni wenyine.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Hano hari amahirwe menshi gusa.
She will be scared.	Azaba afite ubwoba.
I think that was true of me.	Ntekereza ko ibyo byari ukuri kuri njye.
I heard the same thing.	Numvise ikintu kimwe.
Not everything is my fault.	Ntabwo byose ari amakosa yanjye.
It's always something.	Buri gihe ni ikintu.
He did not do everything right.	Ntabwo yakoze byose neza.
Maybe one little kid is scared.	Ahari umwe umwana muto ufite ubwoba.
If you are lucky, you should.	Niba ufite amahirwe, ugomba.
They had no plans.	Nta gahunda bari bafite.
He didn't want to hear.	Ntiyashakaga kumva.
That's exactly what he told me.	Mubyukuri nibyo yambwiye.
Something you might want to look at.	Ikintu ushobora gushaka kureba.
In this.	Muri ibi.
I was a teacher.	Nari umwarimu.
My position may not be good.	Umwanya wanjye ntushobora kuba mwiza.
Sometimes meetings.	Inama rimwe na rimwe.
He is not human.	Ntabwo ari umuntu.
I may be scared.	Nshobora kugira ubwoba.
I don't want to.	Ntabwo nshaka.
I wanted to work.	Nashakaga gukora.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
He came here early.	Yaje hano kare.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
From the outside and inside.	Kuva hanze no imbere.
However, he knew someone who could do something.	Ariko, yari azi umuntu ushobora gukora ikintu.
Nor is it to do anything.	Ntabwo ari no gukora ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
Good reason.	Impamvu nziza.
My age is.	Imyaka yanjye ni.
They know it's true.	Bazi ko ari ukuri.
He is here.	Ari hano.
You are the one who wants money.	Niwowe ushaka amafaranga.
All is well.	Byose nibyiza.
He works all the time.	Akora buri gihe.
You can go now.	Urashobora kugenda nonaha.
He saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe yabonye.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
Nothing good.	Nta cyiza.
He also went downstairs.	Yagiye kandi munsi.
That's not a bad thing.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kibi.
However, the same is not the case.	Ariko, kimwe ntabwo ari ikibazo gito.
That was easy enough.	Ibyo byari byoroshye bihagije.
And if the idea is bad, it's bad.	Niba kandi igitekerezo ari kibi, ni kibi.
I've seen enough here.	Nabonye bihagije hano.
He loved dogs.	Yakundaga imbwa.
I don't have to know everything.	Ntabwo ngomba kumenya byose.
But, it looks good.	Ariko, birasa neza.
I was scared too.	Nanjye nari mfite ubwoba.
She felt scared.	Yumvise afite ubwoba.
We are not friends.	Ntabwo turi inshuti.
But he was scared.	Ariko yari afite ubwoba.
He wants a problem.	Ashaka ikibazo.
Especially since the boy was alone.	Cyane cyane ko umuhungu yari wenyine.
And so is he.	Kandi na we ni uko.
He made this film.	Yakoze iyi firime.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
He didn't want to see anything.	Ntiyashakaga kubona ikintu na kimwe.
Absolutely possible.	Birashoboka rwose.
You had.	Wari ufite.
And for us.	Kandi kuri twe.
We have nothing.	Nta na kimwe dufite.
Very likely.	Birashoboka cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
That sounds good to me.	Ibyo birasa neza kuri njye.
You know how to make a good baby.	Uzi gukora cyane umwana mwiza cyane.
I mean, we don’t have much to eat.	Ndashaka kuvuga, ntabwo dufite byinshi byo kurya.
This is very close now.	Ubu ni hafi cyane.
It's inside.	Ni imbere.
It's a good day.	Ni umunsi mwiza.
Eventually, he was gone.	Amaherezo, yari yagiye.
He never heard of it.	Ntiyigeze yumva.
You were three years old.	Wari ufite imyaka itatu.
I never heard of it.	Sinigeze numva.
He did his time.	Yakoze igihe cye.
How he walks.	Uburyo agenda.
He did nothing.	Ntacyo yakoze.
You, however, are not many people.	Wowe, ariko, ntabwo abantu benshi.
I know he is.	Nzi ko ari we.
Tennis wins.	Tennis gutsinda.
I should have.	Nkwiye kugira.
But most of all, it's not good.	Ariko birashoboka cyane cyane, ntabwo ari byiza.
This is my house.	Iyi ni inzu yanjye.
You can feel it there.	Urashobora kumva ko ahari.
That was a good reason.	Iyo yari impamvu nziza.
I don't know why.	Ntazi impamvu.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
I want to do this at home.	Ndashaka gukora ibi murugo.
He says it's good.	Avuga ko ari byiza.
It wasn’t much.	Ntabwo byari byinshi.
I'm not sure what to think.	Sinzi neza icyo ntekereza.
It is not your teacher.	Ntabwo ari umwarimu wawe.
However, we must.	Ariko, tugomba.
He had a gift.	Yari afite impano.
He used to be one of those.	Yakundaga kuba umwe muri ibyo.
That is the plan.	Iyo ni gahunda.
It is a book.	Ni igitabo.
You and I.	Wowe na njye na we.
But it was not good.	Ariko ntabwo byari byiza.
That was enough for now.	Ibyo byari bihagije kuri ubu.
He is always near me.	Buri gihe ahora hafi yanjye.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
I'm sure he does.	Nzi neza ko abikora.
They were his wife.	Bari umugore we.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
And, he didn't do it.	Kandi, ntabwo yabikoze.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You have to know better than that so far.	Ugomba kumenya neza kuruta ibyo kugeza ubu.
It was very nice and nice.	Byari byiza cyane kandi byiza.
I think here.	Ndatekereza hano.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
He went.	Yagiye.
He is looking down.	Arimo kureba hasi.
Who you were today.	Uwo wari uyu munsi.
He had to act quickly.	Yagombaga gukora vuba.
He needed to go.	Yari akeneye kugenda.
He is now inside me.	Ubu ari imbere muri njye.
He was probably.	Birashoboka ko yari.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
What does he look like.	Icyo asa.
It didn't work out.	Ntabwo byagenze neza.
And it is not.	Kandi sibyo.
I know that's not true.	Nzi ko atari ukuri.
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
It was a great experience.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane.
But, here I am with one.	Ariko, hano hamwe nanjye ni umwe.
He heard nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yumvise.
He did not want to live.	Ntiyashakaga kubaho.
He knew what he wanted.	Yari azi icyo yashakaga.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko aricyo kintu kinini.
And he was gone.	Kandi yari yagiye.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
People are scared.	Abantu bafite ubwoba.
It's a lot farther than usual.	Ni kure cyane kurenza uko byari bisanzwe.
I like cookies.	Nkunda kuki.
I think he is scared.	Ndatekereza ko afite ubwoba.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, ntabwo aribyo.
Who needed to see it ?.	Ninde wari ukeneye kubona?.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
Reka.	Reka.
He is doing a lot of good things.	Arimo akora byinshi byiza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yari kubikora.
All we can say is.	Ibyo dushobora kuvuga byose.
He saw this.	Yabonye ibi.
But he saw nothing.	Ariko nta na kimwe yabonye.
And the truth is.	Kandi ukuri ni.
I was scared.	Nari mfite ubwoba.
I mean, maybe.	Ndashaka kuvuga, birashoboka.
I was thinking though.	Natekerezaga ariko.
Or whatever.	Cyangwa ibyo aribyo byose.
You saw that I was beautiful.	Wabonye ko ndi mwiza.
I think we should try.	Ntekereza ko tugomba kugerageza.
And it was really good.	Kandi byari byiza rwose.
But there is so much to do.	Ariko hariho byinshi byo gukora.
Maybe he had a bad day.	Birashoboka ko yagize umunsi mubi.
He had a lot to do.	Yari afite byinshi byo gukora.
Her hair.	Umusatsi we.
That one was really nice.	Uwo yari mwiza rwose.
I don't know anything else.	Sinzi ikindi.
It is not easy to say.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye kuvuga.
You are good to him.	Uri mwiza kuri we.
I don't think it will be good.	Ntabwo mbona ko bizaba byiza.
I wish there was no better reading.	Ndashaka ko nta gusoma neza.
It is not easy.	Ntabwo byoroshye.
This time, things went the same way.	Iki gihe, ibintu byagenze kimwe.
I wanted to win badly.	Nashakaga gutsinda nabi.
He could have done it.	Yashoboraga kubikora.
I never thought you would like that.	Sinigeze mbona ko ukunda gutya.
Things are good.	Ibintu ni byiza.
One day it will be his turn.	Umunsi umwe bizaba igihe cye.
Her hair was so beautiful.	Umusatsi we wari mwiza cyane.
He really has.	Afite rwose.
We had a lot of plans.	Twari dufite gahunda nyinshi.
She was so much better than before.	Yari mwiza cyane kuruta mbere.
I am a very loving person.	Ndi umuntu ukunda cyane.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa ahari.
He is a good young man.	Ni umusore mwiza.
He had gone too.	Na we yari yagiye.
It was very difficult.	Byari bigoye cyane.
The truth is, he had to go.	Ukuri nuko, yagombaga kugenda.
Looking away.	Kureba kure.
She came home to study.	Yaje murugo kwiga.
Not much.	Nta byinshi.
He went and I don't know where.	Yagiye kandi ntazi aho.
You can't do anything.	Ntushobora gukora ikintu na kimwe.
Whatever you think.	Ibyo utekereza byose.
I can't let this happen.	Sinshobora kureka ibi.
Not all of us.	Ntabwo twese twese.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You have to live.	Ugomba kubaho.
But you are here.	Ariko uri hano.
I didn’t want him to be alone.	Sinifuzaga ko aba wenyine.
None of us knew this very well.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari uzi neza ibi.
Shame.	Isoni.
I was scared for the first time.	Nagize ubwoba bwa mbere.
But it is not.	Ariko ntabwo.
Not now.	Ntabwo ari ubu.
He loves the program.	Akunda gahunda.
One woman went ahead.	Umugore umwe yagiye imbere.
Or indeed years.	Cyangwa rwose imyaka.
This is not good enough.	Ibi ntabwo ari byiza bihagije.
It is perfect for what I need.	Nibyiza cyane kubyo nkeneye.
But he will not do it.	Ariko ntabwo azabikora.
What you like	Ibyo ukunda.
I don't see this.	Ntabwo mbona ibi.
He has to go.	Agomba kugenda.
Please let me go.	Nyamuneka reka reka.
He came to work.	Yaje ku kazi.
He had things to do, they all had.	Yari afite ibintu byo gukora, bose bari bafite.
I thought for a long time.	Natekerezaga igihe kinini.
I thought of getting a new car.	Natekereje kubona imodoka nshya.
It was all true.	Byose byari ukuri.
They are all here.	Bose bari hano.
He has to come soon.	Agomba kuza vuba.
He has nothing.	Nta na kimwe afite.
This one you can have.	Uyu ushobora kugira.
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
It's good to see you look good.	Nibyiza kubona usa neza.
That's right.	Ibyo ni byo.
But it was difficult.	Ariko byari bigoye.
Now we have to go with it.	Ubu tugomba kujyana.
I'm glad that.	Nishimiye ibyo.
It is one or the other.	Ni kimwe cyangwa ikindi.
Good idea.	Igitekerezo cyiza.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
You are nothing.	Ntacyo uri cyo.
He does whatever he wants.	Akora icyo ashaka cyose.
It was too much.	Byari byinshi cyane.
You are one of us.	Uri umwe muri twe.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
It is clear that this is possible.	Biragaragara neza ko bishoboka.
There is so much.	Hariho byinshi.
You saw that.	Wabonye ibyo.
I have my time now.	Mfite umwanya wanjye ubu.
He went where he was.	Yagiye aho ari.
He was not a friend to her.	Ntiyari inshuti kuri we.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
He was an actor.	Yari umukinnyi.
Not far away.	Ntabwo ari kure.
Not really.	Mubyukuri sibyo.
He didn’t take much.	Ntabwo yafashe byinshi.
You have no friends.	Ntabwo ufite inshuti.
We were all.	Twese twari.
But in the end it is the truth.	Ariko amaherezo amaherezo ni ukuri.
In fact it was true.	Mubyukuri byari ukuri.
Long time no see.	Igihe kirekire mubyukuri.
More than anyone.	Kuruta umuntu uwo ari we wese.
I know my time.	Nzi umwanya wanjye.
She really enjoyed her day.	Yishimiye umunsi we rwose.
I can't help it.	Ntashobora gufasha.
Maybe you can tell me.	Ahari ushobora kumbwira.
Who is on top ?.	Ninde uri hejuru?.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He looked the best.	Yarebye neza kuruta byose.
It was a bad time for him.	Byari umwanya mubi kuri we.
There is so much to say.	Hariho ibintu byinshi byo kuvuga.
I really needed to go.	Nari nkeneye rwose kugenda.
There was not much he could do.	Nta byinshi yashoboraga gukora.
If he does that, it's just possible.	Niba akora ibyo, birashoboka gusa.
And you think a lot.	Kandi uratekereza cyane.
It is not a very good thing.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byiza cyane.
Today, however, it is.	Uyu munsi ariko, ni.
He doesn't want to do anything else.	Ntashaka ikindi akora.
You don't have to work hard.	Ntagomba gukora cyane.
Stop saying and doing something.	Reka kuvuga no gukora ikintu.
He has to play.	Agomba gukina.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
And he did very well outside.	Kandi yakoze neza cyane hanze.
It's not good, it's probably bad.	Ntabwo ari mwiza, birashoboka ko ari mubi.
He had no problem with that.	Nta kibazo yari afite kuri ibyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nukuri icyo gihe.
It really does look great to me.	Mubyukuri birasa cyane kuri njye.
Most of the time the food is good.	Igihe kinini ibiryo ni byiza.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Nibyiza, hariho ikibazo.
He likes to say what he thinks.	Akunda kuvuga icyo atekereza.
There is a house here.	Hano hari inzu.
He wants to live.	Ashaka kubaho.
He had good things to do.	Yari afite ibintu byiza byo gukora.
That's what everyone says.	Nibyo buri wese avuga.
What he would get.	Ibyo yari kubona.
Eventually, he got the idea.	Amaherezo, yabonye igitekerezo.
That's great, really.	Nibyiza cyane, mubyukuri.
He may be bad.	Arashobora kuba mubi.
I saw something, but it was not.	Nabonye ikintu, ariko sibyo.
He thought it was great.	Yatekereje ko ari byiza cyane.
Me.	Njye.
He asked his friend.	Yabajije inshuti ye.
But it is not.	Ariko sibyo.
She loved her children.	Yakundaga abana be.
He never thought of anything else.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ikindi kintu.
I can't do everything.	Sinshobora byose.
But tell me why.	Ariko mbwira impamvu.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari impungenge gusa.
Or maybe he's just telling the truth.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko avuga ukuri gusa.
It’s not very smart.	Ntabwo ari ubwenge cyane.
As usual	Nkuko byari bisanzwe.
It's a real problem.	Ni ikibazo rwose.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
And it is not easy.	Kandi ntabwo byoroshye.
Everyone was here soon.	Abantu bose bari hano vuba.
He was a dog.	Yari imbwa.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
He was the one who needed help.	Ni we wari ukeneye ubufasha.
He had never looked before.	Nta kintu na kimwe yasaga mbere.
I think he is right.	Ntekereza ko afite ukuri.
I only have one problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe gusa.
Many things are not.	Ibintu byinshi sibyo.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
I never saw it.	Sinigeze mbona.
He seemed to know it all the time.	Yasaga naho azi igihe cyose.
However, you would be worried.	Ariko, wari kuba ufite impungenge.
Everything is great.	Byose ni byiza cyane.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
From the first day.	Kuva ku munsi wa mbere.
She thought she was beautiful.	Yatekereje ko ari mwiza.
The whole family.	Umuryango wose.
You do nothing.	Ntacyo ukora.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko hari igihe nari.
He must.	Agomba.
Not then, never.	Ntabwo ari icyo gihe, nta na rimwe.
He also came here.	Na we yaje hano.
We are down.	Ni hasi.
You have to be friends.	Ugomba kuba inshuti.
Now we need to talk.	Ubu dukeneye kuvuga.
At times, he did not know how to stay or move.	Rimwe na rimwe, ntabwo yari azi kuguma cyangwa kugenda.
But that's exactly what he did.	Ariko ibyo ni byo yakoze.
Seeing is really human.	Kubona ni abantu rwose.
If it's good with you.	Niba ari byiza nawe.
And very young.	Kandi muto cyane.
He can make money.	Arashobora kubona amafaranga.
He doesn’t have me, he doesn’t have much.	Nta njye, nta byinshi afite.
This is something.	Ubu ni ikintu.
I'm not sure where.	Sinzi neza aho.
One is very good.	Umuntu nibyiza cyane.
The space we really needed.	Umwanya nukuri twari dukeneye.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
Just one question.	Ikibazo kimwe gusa.
He knew this.	Iki yari azi.
Probably his money.	Birashoboka rwose amafaranga ye.
I have to go.	Ngomba kugenda.
You can beat that.	Urashobora gutsinda ibyo.
That’s what we have to do this week.	Nibyo tugomba gukora muri iki cyumweru.
And you can do that.	Kandi urashobora kubikora.
Maybe this one was trying to do it.	Birashoboka ko uyu yari yagerageje kubikora.
It was not good at all.	Ntabwo byari byiza rwose.
That's what I feel.	Ibyo ndumva aribyo.
But in the end, he did.	Ariko amaherezo, yaje.
This is not a far cry.	Iki ntabwo ari igitekerezo cya kure.
Yes, they did.	Nibyo, ariko bari.
But he too cannot go back.	Ariko na we ntashobora gusubira inyuma.
But there is something wrong with work.	Ariko hariho ikintu kibi ku kazi.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
She thinks it's great.	Yibwira ko ari byiza cyane.
It's always the same.	Buri gihe ni kimwe.
I don't have to.	Ntabwo ngomba kugira.
I am right.	Ndi ukuri.
Today is the day to get a job.	Uyu munsi umunsi ushobora kubona akazi.
He enjoyed it here.	Yishimiye hano.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
I mean every night.	Ndashaka kuvuga buri joro.
He feels good.	Yumva neza.
Tell me what he means.	Mbwira icyo ashaka kuvuga.
But he can't do it.	Ariko ntashobora kubikora.
But we must be aware of this.	Ariko tugomba kumenya neza.
It would not be very good.	Ntabwo byaba ari byiza rwose.
I heard on the floor.	Numvise hasi.
I mean, he has a lot to do.	Ndashaka kuvuga, afite byinshi akora.
I have something for him, now.	Mfite ikintu kuri we, ubu.
I guess you may have the same problem.	Ndakeka ko ushobora kuba ufite ikibazo kimwe.
Like everything.	Nka byose.
He also said.	Yavuze kandi.
That's not the case with me.	Ntabwo aribyo kuri njye.
Here is your time.	Hano hari umwanya wawe.
He has a gift.	Afite impano.
Now you can't.	Ubu ntushobora.
Or that he knows what will happen.	Cyangwa ko azi uko bizaba.
But not all people are very lucky.	Ariko ntabwo abantu bose bafite amahirwe menshi.
What are you doing?	Icyo ukora ni iki.
He was very lucky.	Yari afite amahirwe menshi.
I thought you could, though.	Natekereje ko ushobora, ariko.
Formerly a house.	Inzu yahoze.
It worked out so well.	Byagenze neza cyane.
She was scared to eat.	Yari afite ubwoba bwo kurya.
Nice and nice house.	Inzu nziza kandi nziza.
He was a child.	Yari umwana.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
But there is another problem.	Ariko hariho ikindi kibazo.
And you can talk to him.	Kandi urashobora kuvugana na we.
I don't have one now.	Ntabwo mfite ubu.
But that is possible.	Ariko ibyo bishoboka birashoboka.
Coming here was a mistake.	Kuza hano byari amakosa.
It started another time.	Yatangiye ikindi gihe.
Something to do.	Ikintu cyo gukora.
Or in the morning.	Cyangwa mu gitondo.
Really, really good, time.	Mubyukuri, nibyiza rwose, igihe.
You are here, and now it is.	Uri hano, kandi ubu ni ubu.
Or my daughter.	Cyangwa umukobwa wanjye.
There are also early mornings.	Hariho na kare ya kare.
He did not.	Ntabwo yabikoze.
He was my son.	Yari umuhungu wanjye.
Not here.	Ntabwo ari hano.
She must be worried about him.	Agomba kuba hafi ye afite impungenge.
.	.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu ibyo.
We really have.	Dufite rwose.
If so.	Niba byari ukuri.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
This one was new to me.	Iyi yari nshya kuri njye.
This, however, was not difficult.	Ibi ariko, ntabwo byari bigoye.
I can do it again.	Nshobora kongera kubikora.
None of us had a job.	Nta n'umwe muri twe wari ufite akazi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko yabikoze.
I want to live.	Ndashaka kubaho.
They were not many.	Ntabwo bari benshi.
I know he's home.	Nzi ko ari murugo.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Byari byiza, yari akeneye ibi.
I want to be me.	Ndashaka kuba njye.
I think he went home.	Ndakeka ko yagiye murugo.
It was not true.	Ntabwo byari ukuri.
There are things to do.	Hariho ibintu byo gukora.
I'm glad he's a friend.	Nishimiye ko ari inshuti.
Above all, we are all human.	Hejuru ya byose, twese turi abantu.
I need to talk.	Nkeneye kuvuga.
He was not bad either.	Na we ntiyari mubi.
Bad day	Umunsi mubi.
He clearly saw something he had never done.	Yabonye neza ikintu atigeze akora.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora.
But now we have another problem.	Ariko ubu dufite ikindi kibazo.
It was easy.	Byari byoroshye.
And it is possible.	Kandi birashoboka.
His father was right.	Se yari afite ukuri.
He seemed to have never heard of it.	Yasaga naho atigeze yumva.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe yashoboraga gukora kuri ibyo.
He always thought things through before he did.	Buri gihe yatekerezaga ibintu neza mbere yuko abikora.
He left quickly.	Yagiye vuba.
But this is not good.	Ariko ibi ntabwo ari byiza.
I'm not sure why.	Sinzi neza impamvu.
However, it did not go well.	Ariko, ntabwo byagenze neza.
He will do it today.	Uyu munsi azabikora.
He was not smart.	Ntiyari afite ubwenge.
I'm scared easily.	Mfite ubwoba byoroshye.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byiza.
I am not.	Nanjye sibyo.
Everything about this thing, this thing inside of him.	Byose kuri iki kintu, iki kintu imbere muri we.
You must have been bad.	Ugomba kuba wari mubi.
We have to go to the meeting.	Tugomba kujya inama.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
And in fact.	Kandi mubyukuri.
It was today.	Yari uyu munsi.
Did he ever work?	Yigeze akora?
You need more.	Ukeneye byinshi.
That's right, then.	Nibyo, icyo gihe.
It's good advice.	Ni inama nziza.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Nta kintu na kimwe dushobora gukora.
He is.	Ni we.
That's good.	Ibyo ni byiza.
Like.	Nkuko.
You can do it from there.	Urashobora kubikora kuva aho.
It will not be the same,.	Ntabwo bizaba kimwe,.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
You must also be below.	Ugomba kandi kuba munsi.
They know where you are now.	Bazi aho uri ubu.
She is really a child.	Ni umwana rwose.
It was just good.	Byari byiza gusa.
I feel good about myself so far.	Numva ari byiza kuri njye kugeza ubu.
Up, up, and away.	Hejuru, hejuru, na kure.
It's a great time.	Ni umwanya mwiza.
She absolutely loved it.	Yakundaga rwose.
He was very good at it.	Yari mwiza cyane kuri byo.
That was true.	Ibyo byari ukuri.
He didn't know what to do.	Ntiyari azi neza icyo.
It was good and good.	Byari byiza kandi byiza.
We have another problem.	Dufite ikindi kibazo.
But sometimes, with us.	Ariko rimwe na rimwe, hamwe natwe.
They are now out.	Ubu bari hanze.
For him you are a young child.	Kuri we uri umwana muto.
You don't look good.	Ntabwo usa neza.
Someone with problems.	Umuntu ufite ibibazo.
I doubt it.	Ndashidikanya.
Good stuff here.	Ibintu byiza hano.
You have enough of that.	Ufite ibyo bihagije.
One thing, though.	Ikintu kimwe, naho.
I need that.	Nkeneye ibyo.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
This is a good thing.	Ibi ni ibintu byiza.
I have to go ahead.	Ngomba kujya imbere.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
Bad day, all in all.	Umunsi mubi, byose muri byose.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
She is not his wife.	Ntabwo ari umugore we.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
They know nothing.	Nta cyo bazi.
He had the same problem.	Yari afite ikibazo kimwe.
You were a young girl.	Wari umukobwa muto.
He was everyone.	Yari abantu bose.
He looked closely.	Yarebye neza.
My daughter loved it there.	Umukobwa wanjye yakundaga aho.
You have to be good.	Ugomba kugira neza.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
However, that is not the case here or here.	Ariko, ibyo ntabwo ari hano cyangwa hano.
Much of it actually.	Byinshi mubyukuri.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
I'm not happy about that.	Ntabwo nishimiye ibyo.
And he needed to do it.	Kandi yari akeneye kubikora.
It was a lot.	Byari byinshi.
I am everything else.	Ndi ikindi kintu cyose.
Good day	Umunsi mwiza.
It was true, and it was good.	Byari ukuri, kandi byari byiza.
Maybe he should stop reading now.	Birashoboka ko agomba guhagarika gusoma ubu.
I knew.	Nari nzi.
He also wanted everything.	Yashakaga kandi byose.
Anyone could come here.	Umuntu wese yashoboraga kuza hano.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
You really don't have time.	Ntabwo rwose ufite umwanya.
He went close.	Yagiye hafi.
Stopping is.	Guhagarika ni.
It is not difficult to win at all.	Ntabwo bigoye gutsinda na gato.
He is young.	Ari muto.
Tomorrow will be a good day for you.	Nukuri ejo waba umunsi mwiza.
I understand why.	Ndumva impamvu.
Everything was out.	Ibintu byose byari hanze.
He was a good child.	Yari umwana mwiza.
The little girl was also scared.	Umukobwa muto nawe yagize ubwoba.
We just have to stop drinking too much.	Tugomba gusa guhagarika kunywa cyane.
I was thinking about this.	Natekerezaga kuri ibi.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nyamuneka nyamuneka.
Let the girl.	Reka umukobwa.
Doing good things.	Gukora ibintu byiza.
He was sitting at the time.	Icyo gihe yari yicaye.
There is something very wrong.	Hariho ikintu kibi cyane.
We have a problem.	Dufite ikibazo.
It's great to be here.	Nibyiza cyane kuza.
He thought one day would be good.	Yatekereje ko umunsi umwe yaba mwiza.
I want to be outside, away from him.	Ndashaka hanze, kure ye.
This time you should have studied better.	Iki gihe wari ukwiye kwiga neza.
He was here yesterday.	Yari hano ejo.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
It is a good family.	Ni umuryango mwiza.
When everything is plentiful.	Iyo ibintu byose ari byinshi.
He didn't have to do it.	Ntabwo yagombaga kubikora.
I really need to go.	Nkeneye rwose kugenda.
I never saw your car.	Sinigeze mbona imodoka yawe.
The woman was.	Umugore yari.
Obviously we are.	Biragaragara ko turi.
A good car indeed.	Imodoka nziza nukuri.
He said everything, well and well.	Yavuze byose, neza na byose.
But he never had a chance.	Ariko ntabwo yigeze agira amahirwe.
I am too.	Nanjye ndi.
This was his chance.	Ibi byari amahirwe ye.
He then picked up the phone.	Icyo gihe yafashe terefone.
I feel it is a problem.	Numva ari ikibazo.
I didn't think so.	Ntabwo natekerezaga.
It would be easy for all of us.	Byaba byoroshye kuri twese.
I think quickly.	Ntekereza vuba.
And it will be.	Kandi bizaba.
This was good advice.	Iyi yari inama nziza.
He may be bad.	Ashobora kuba mubi.
Or maybe.	Cyangwa birashoboka.
Here, it is not.	Hano, ntabwo aribyo.
That's fine now.	Nibyiza ubu.
But he.	Ariko we.
That's great.	Nibyo byiza cyane.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka cyane birashoboka.
This is normal.	Ibi ni ibintu bisanzwe.
He can't do it alone.	Ntashobora kubikora wenyine.
However, that is not all.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo byose.
I wanted to stop.	Nashakaga guhagarika igihe.
It's good to read.	Nibyiza gusoma.
Stop doing that !.	Reka gukora ibyo!.
And that will happen.	Kandi ibyo bizaba.
Anyone can make mistakes.	Umuntu wese arashobora gukora amakosa.
He tried anything.	Yagerageje ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose.
He was not a favorite person.	Ntiyari umuntu ukunda.
That's good !!!!.	Nibyiza !!!!.
Please leave a job.	Nyamuneka, reka akazi.
We are here now, and you are not.	Turi hano ubu, kandi ntabwo uri.
And she was so beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza cyane.
Not only this, with the help of technology you can do better.	Ntabwo ari uko gusa ari byiza cyane kubana.
He had something on that.	Yari afite ikintu kuri ibyo.
Kandi.	Kandi.
At that time.	Icyo gihe.
He watched as he chose what to say.	Yarebye uko yahisemo icyo avuga.
You can't be.	Ntushobora kuba.
That his wife was gone.	Ko umugore we yagiye.
It looks good.	Birasa neza.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko bafite ukuri.
You were a child too.	Nawe wari umwana.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, nibyiza.
Tomorrow would be a day.	Ejo byari kuba umunsi.
I don't know when.	Ntabwo nzi igihe.
He didn't know who he was, whatever it was.	Ntabwo yari azi uwo ari we, ibyo aribyo byose.
He may have thought it was you.	Birashoboka ko yatekereje ko ari wowe.
I love this one very much.	Nkunda iyi cyane.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
You can do anything.	Urashobora gukora ikintu icyo aricyo cyose.
He lives in the present.	Aba muri iki gihe.
No one can walk.	Nta muntu ushobora kugenda.
I did nothing, really nothing, for a long time.	Ntacyo nakoze, mubyukuri ntacyo, igihe kinini.
It was normal.	Byari ibintu bisanzwe.
He should not do that.	Ntabwo agomba kubikora.
Food costs.	Amafaranga yo kurya.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
It is not your family.	Ntabwo ari umuryango wawe.
I am not a boy.	Ntabwo ndi umuhungu.
He wanted my money.	Yashakaga amafaranga yanjye.
He wants to work.	Ashaka gukora.
I was scared.	Nari mfite ubwoba.
I need everything for him.	Nkeneye byose kuri we.
You have no job.	Nta kazi ntacyo uri.
He never needed it.	Ntabwo yari akeneye na rimwe.
It's not easy.	Ntabwo rwose byoroshye.
And he was beautiful.	Kandi yari mwiza.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Or most of us.	Cyangwa benshi muri twe.
He did the same.	Ni na ko yabikoze.
I have done nothing wrong today.	Nta kibi nakoze muri iki gihe.
I'm glad to hear that everything went well.	Nishimiye kumva ibintu byose byagenze neza.
They have many children.	Bafite abana benshi.
It will be really good.	Bizaba byiza rwose.
I did not know who.	Sinari nzi uwo.
I don't find this difficult.	Ntabwo mbona ibi bigoye.
I'm glad I'm worried.	Nishimiye impungenge.
That's the way it is.	Kuri gutya.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko byari byinshi cyane.
Apparently he was worried about her.	Biragaragara ko yari afite impungenge kuri we.
I did this.	Nakoze ibi.
You have a family here.	Ufite umuryango hano.
I hope everything is fine.	Nizere ko byose ari byiza.
I think you have problems.	Ndatekereza ko ufite ibibazo.
Something good.	Ikintu ni cyiza.
You may have seen it today.	Birashoboka ko wabonye uyu munsi.
And we had that.	Kandi twari dufite ibyo.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ibyo birasa.
He just knew he had to try.	Yari azi gusa ko agomba kugerageza.
It's nice and simple.	Nibyiza kandi byoroshye.
It's just a chance.	Ni amahirwe gusa.
That one thing is good.	Icyo kintu kimwe ni cyiza.
And he knew exactly what to do.	Kandi yari azi neza icyo gukora.
Dogs are good for that.	Imbwa ni nziza kuri ibyo.
And he knows how to do it.	Kandi azi kubikora.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
You can buy anything in no time.	Urashobora kugura ikintu icyo aricyo cyose mugihe gito.
He went too far.	Yagiye kure cyane.
He has a plan.	Afite gahunda.
He understands why.	Yumva impamvu.
I was not here.	Ntabwo nari hano.
But this is not the case.	Ariko ibi ntabwo aribyo.
You really need to read a good book.	Ukeneye rwose gusoma igitabo cyiza.
I can't take this anymore.	Sinshobora kongera gufata ibi.
.	.
It was good at the time.	Icyo gihe byari byiza.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye.
You can even live with one another.	Urashobora no kubana numwe.
But more.	Ariko byinshi.
It is not his fault.	Ntabwo ari amakosa ye.
What he wants.	Ibyo ashaka.
I just feel that way.	Ndumva aribyo gusa.
It’s always money.	Buri gihe ni amafaranga.
You can swim.	Urashobora koga.
He was very young.	Yari muto cyane.
He doesn't know much.	Ntabwo azi neza.
The baby is beautiful.	Umwana ni mwiza.
He did not want a wife.	Ntiyashakaga umugore.
That's right, you're smart.	Nibyo, ufite ubwenge.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka kubikora.
It was very easy.	Byari byoroshye cyane.
You have to have.	Ugomba kugira.
He knew the money.	Yamenye amafaranga.
I have to stop.	Ngomba guhagarika.
He would not do it.	Ntabwo yari kubikora.
You don't think so.	Ntabwo utekereza.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ibyo aribyo byose, nibyiza.
He had that.	Yari afite ibyo.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
For one of us, in fact.	Kuri umwe muri twe, mubyukuri.
I'm just glad I can hear this again.	Nishimiye gusa kuba nshobora kongera kumva ibi.
And you only have a reason.	Kandi ufite impamvu gusa.
Everything is simple.	Ibintu byose byoroshye.
Or just not on the floor.	Cyangwa gusa ntabwo ari hasi.
But it really wasn't enough.	Ariko rwose ntabwo byari bihagije.
It would be great.	Byaba byiza cyane.
He is not alone.	Ntabwo ari we wenyine.
Little boy	Umuhungu muto.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
You were so beautiful.	Wari mwiza cyane.
He is here.	Ari hano.
As you were.	Nkuko wari.
I know things.	Nzi ibintu.
He does this every day.	Ibyo abikora buri munsi.
I have made many friends.	Nagize inshuti cyane.
He was lucky.	Yari yagize amahirwe.
Up and in.	Hejuru no muri.
And you can try.	Kandi urashobora kugerageza.
It would be nice.	Byari kuba byiza.
And that's fine.	Kandi ni byiza.
Very, very close.	Cyane, hafi cyane.
I don't know how to say it, but you can.	Sinzi uko ushobora kuvuga, ariko urashobora.
We are very close.	Turi hafi cyane.
One thing we need to know is that at any time.	Ikintu kimwe tugomba kumenya nuko igihe aricyo cyose.
All is well and good.	Byose byiza kandi byiza.
Even today.	No muri iki gihe.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
It's outside.	Ari hanze.
I think it's absolutely possible.	Ntekereza ko bishoboka rwose.
I think about a lot of things in fact.	Ntekereza kuri byinshi mubyukuri.
He had heard nothing that day.	Uwo munsi nta kintu yari yumvise.
You can do it at any time.	Urashobora kubikora igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
In fact.	Mubyukuri.
He was not the only one.	Ntabwo yari we rwose.
It’s not a seizure or anything else.	Ntabwo ari gufata cyangwa ikindi kintu cyose.
It looks good to get home.	Birasa neza kugeza murugo.
Above all.	Hejuru ya byose.
There is something for everyone.	Hariho ikintu kuri buri wese.
He did.	Yabikoze.
Most are children.	Benshi ni abana.
He probably meant where he lived.	Birashoboka ko yashakaga kuvuga aho aba.
And here we are here.	Kandi hano turi hano.
He didn’t want to, until now.	Ntiyashakaga, kugeza ubu.
He has.	Afite .
You are thirty years old.	Ufite imyaka mirongo itatu.
Dog.	Imbwa.
They have time.	Bafite igihe.
But there is a catch.	Ariko hariho gufata.
It's here.	Ndi hano.
But it was good.	Ariko byari byiza.
He didn't know much.	Ntiyari azi neza.
He had gone too far.	Yari yagiye kure cyane.
And that's exactly what he did.	Kandi ibyo ni byo yakoze.
That's the idea.	Icyo ni igitekerezo.
I don't.	Ntabwo.
But not everyone is.	Ariko abantu bose sibyo.
There is a young man here.	Hano hari umusore.
The book is great.	Igitabo ni cyiza.
He can't speak at all.	Ntashobora kuvuga na gato.
There is wisdom here.	Hano hari ubwenge.
But man, it was great.	Ariko umuntu, byari byiza cyane.
Or something else he needed to do.	Cyangwa ikindi kintu yari akeneye gukora.
You don't have to wait.	Ntugomba gutegereza.
I know a lot.	Nzi byinshi cyane.
But it is possible.	Ariko birashoboka.
He looked away.	Yarebye kure.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza kimwe uzi kuvuga.
I didn't know what to think.	Sinari nzi icyo ntekereza.
I thought it would be great.	Natekereje ko byaba byiza rwose.
And it's not good.	Kandi ntabwo ari byiza.
I guess we should see.	Ndakeka ko tugomba kubona.
I would like a bus.	Nari gutwara bisi neza.
There is so much to see and so much to learn.	Hariho byinshi byo kubona kandi byinshi byo kwiga.
You can't think straight.	Ntushobora gutekereza neza.
It was not good.	Ntabwo byari byiza.
I did not know where.	Sinari nzi aho.
It was good when he wasn't.	Byari byiza igihe atari.
Opportunity is at hand.	Amahirwe ari hafi.
If not, it is not.	Niba atari byo, ntabwo.
What's wrong with the phone? 	Niki kibi kuri terefone?
But all together it was too much.	Ariko byose hamwe byari byinshi cyane.
It's good to feel good.	Nibyiza kumva ari mwiza.
Well, not always.	Nibyiza, ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
I do not understand.	Ntabwo numva.
I want him to be there.	Ndashaka ko aba ahari.
Someone knew a lot about him.	Umuntu yari azi byinshi kuri we.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
There is one thing in me.	Hariho ikintu kimwe muri njye.
There is a lot behind it.	Hariho byinshi inyuma.
Good.	Nziza.
Good time	Igihe cyiza.
But he said nothing.	Ariko ntacyo yavuze.
Too much.	Byinshi cyane.
Or maybe it's not a problem.	Cyangwa birashoboka ko atari ikibazo.
He left early in the morning.	Yagiye kare mu gitondo.
I mean, how do you do that?	Ndashaka kuvuga uburyo bwo kubikora.
That's great.	Nibyiza cyane.
If you can beat that, you can win almost everything.	Niba ushobora gutsinda ibyo, urashobora gutsinda hafi ya byose.
I needed one.	Nari nkeneye umwe.
He loved both.	Yakundaga bombi.
It really was.	Byari ibintu rwose.
Today was a good day.	Uyu munsi wari mwiza.
He is a good person.	Ni umuntu mwiza.
No one has time.	Nta muntu ufite umwanya.
Nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe.
But you deserve more.	Ariko ukwiye byinshi.
I'm not sure if it's my car.	Ntabwo nzi neza ko ari imodoka yanjye.
It was true.	Byari ukuri.
I think this is really good.	Ntekereza ko ibi ari byiza rwose.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He must be.	Agomba kuba.
I don't want to go to this new world.	Sinshaka kujya kuri iyi si nshya.
You can live longer.	Urashobora kubaho igihe kirekire.
At the time, he had nothing.	Icyo gihe nta kintu yari afite.
He seemed to think it was too easy.	Yasaga naho atekereza ko byoroshye cyane.
I never thought it was.	Sinigeze ntekereza ko ari.
If it is bad.	Niba ari mubi.
Not really good.	Ntabwo rwose ari byiza.
You can have more.	Urashobora kugira byinshi.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kubikora.
We can't go far.	Ntidushobora kujya kure.
Those are the children.	Ibyo ni abana.
You don't have to make a movie.	Ntugomba gukora firime.
I can't think straight.	Sinshobora gutekereza neza.
That was possible.	Ibyo byari bishoboka.
It was a great day for all of us.	Wari umunsi mwiza kuri twese.
A lot of foreign currency.	Amafaranga menshi yo hanze.
Never, never young.	Nta na rimwe, nta na rimwe ari muto.
That is his opinion.	Icyo ni igitekerezo cye.
He had a problem.	Yari afite ikibazo.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
That is something else.	Icyo ni ikindi kintu.
Nothing for him.	Nta kintu na kimwe kuri we.
It's a big deal.	Ni ikintu kinini.
Or on.	Cyangwa kuri.
But not only that.	Ariko sibyo gusa.
She wants it to be better.	Yifuza ko byaba byiza.
I don't know a guy.	Ntabwo nzi umusore.
We can do nothing.	Ntacyo dushobora gukora.
It was difficult.	Byari bigoye.
I need to know why.	Nkeneye kumenya impamvu.
He was there at the time.	Icyo gihe yari ahari.
Sometimes there are attempts to communicate.	Rimwe na rimwe hariho kugerageza kuvugana.
Not very good.	Ntabwo ari byiza cyane.
When he was there.	Igihe yari ahari.
But the house.	Ariko inzu.
But this is not the case.	Ibi ariko ntabwo aribyo.
Live as if you were everything.	Kubaho nka no kuri buri kintu.
I like a good book.	Nkunda igitabo cyiza.
Same idea.	Igitekerezo kimwe.
I think it is good and very easy !!.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza kandi byoroshye cyane !!.
You are far from him.	Uri kure ye.
And everything is great.	Kandi ibintu byose ni byiza cyane.
That worked out well.	Ibyo byagenze neza.
You are outside alone.	Wowe uri hanze wenyine wenyine.
He seemed to know everything.	Yasaga naho azi byose.
He has a new dog.	Afite imbwa nshya.
Leave it alone.	Kureka wenyine.
I thought about this.	Natekereje kuri ibi.
Either way, we can’t wait.	Ibyo ari byo byose, ntidushobora gutegereza.
Doing very well.	Gukora neza cyane.
To do.	Gukora.
Or nothing.	Cyangwa nta kintu na kimwe.
However, this is not always the case.	Ariko, ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
It is not a time.	Ntabwo ari umwanya.
There is a lot of opportunity here.	Hano hari amahirwe menshi.
I was here every day.	Nari hano buri munsi.
No one is here.	Nta muntu uri hano.
Not always.	Ntabwo buri gihe.
This was a good thing.	Ibi byari ibintu byiza.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Ko ibyo ari ukuri, ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
Absolutely here.	Hano rwose.
As one would do.	Nkuko umuntu azabikora.
I was a young boy at the time.	Icyo gihe nari umuhungu muto.
Anyone, was nice.	Umuntu uwo ari we wese, yari mwiza.
This will happen later.	Ibi bizaba nyuma.
And he will never do that.	Kandi ntazigera abikora.
And that’s not normal.	Kandi ntabwo ari ibintu bisanzwe.
In fact, he was right.	Mubyukuri, yari afite ukuri.
And it's very close.	Kandi ni hafi cyane.
When absolutely not.	Mugihe rwose atabikoze.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
He thought he knew how, once.	Yibwiraga ko yari azi uburyo, rimwe.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
Absolutely.	Nukuri rwose.
I have no plans.	Nta gahunda mfite.
Not at all.	Ntabwo ari muri byose.
But he knew in that look that he was a woman.	Ariko yari azi ko uyu ari umugore kuri we.
I was a teacher.	Nari umwarimu.
With everything.	Hamwe na byose.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Otherwise, it would have been better.	Iyo atari byo, byari byiza.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ibyo byari ukuri.
Your son wants to know why.	Umuhungu wawe arashaka kumenya impamvu.
I need to talk to him.	Nkeneye kuvugana na we.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, birashoboka ko atari byinshi.
It was great.	Byari byiza cyane.
She can only do her hair.	Arashobora gukora umusatsi we gusa.
He went down.	Yagiye hasi.
You have to stop talking and hearing.	Ugomba guhagarika kuvuga no kumva.
You have to give up that.	Ugomba kureka ibyo.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo, ntacyo aricyo.
That's right.	Nukuri.
Not many.	Ntabwo ari benshi.
Very nice girl	Umukobwa mwiza cyane.
First of all, it’s great.	Mbere ya byose, ni nziza.
He wanted her to be scared, just like him.	Yashakaga ko agira ubwoba, nka we.
She is a woman to me.	Ni umugore kuri njye.
I knew what was going to happen.	Nari nzi uko byari kugenda.
And maybe we should.	Kandi birashoboka ko tugomba.
It was a gift.	Byari impano.
That was exactly what happened.	Ibyo byari ibintu rwose.
Beautiful woman	Umugore mwiza.
I know what it is.	Nzi ikintu icyo aricyo.
I have a book here.	Mfite igitabo hano.
That's right.	Nibyo.
You don't know anything.	Ntabwo uzi icyo aricyo cyose.
I did wrong.	Nakoze nabi.
From the time you were a little girl to now.	Kuva igihe wari umukobwa muto kugeza ubu.
I didn't see much about his father.	Ntabwo nabonye byinshi kuri se.
He was close to her.	Yari hafi ye.
That, it is.	Icyo, ni.
There is work here.	Hano hari akazi.
He never thought he was bad.	Ntiyigeze atekereza ko ari mubi.
This is not the right time.	Uyu ntabwo ari umwanya ukwiye.
That's exactly what we can't do.	Nibyo rwose ntidushobora gukora.
I don't know how.	Sinzi uko.
He makes no mistakes.	Ntabwo akora amakosa.
They knew everything.	Bari bazi byose.
That's fine here.	Nibyiza hano.
He said he did.	Yavuze ko yabikoze.
I love my beautiful new home.	Nkunda inzu yanjye nshya nziza.
This is not true.	Ntabwo ari ukuri.
It is not difficult to know why.	Ntabwo bigoye kumenya impamvu.
A lot of this is true.	Ibi byinshi nibyo.
That's all there is to it.	Ibyo aribyo byose kumenya.
But you have to be out here.	Ariko ugomba kuba hanze aha.
You can do it right.	Urashobora kubikora neza.
The party was really good.	Ibirori byari byiza rwose.
I really enjoy that fact.	Nishimiye cyane uko kuri.
It was good to be back.	Byari byiza gusubira.
But there are probably many.	Ariko birashoboka ko hari benshi.
However, that is not the case.	Ariko, ntabwo aribyo.
But you can't stay.	Ariko ntushobora kuguma.
I should have had a job.	Nari nkwiye kugira akazi.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
He said he was an actor.	Yavuze ko yari umukinnyi.
The truth is that people are scared.	Ukuri nuko abantu bafite ubwoba.
Not good.	Ntabwo ari byiza.
But not all people are very lucky.	Ariko ntabwo abantu bose bafite amahirwe menshi.
There is something to be done.	Hariho ikintu cyo gukora.
For me, it was the end.	Kuri njye, byari amaherezo.
Obviously, though, this is possible.	Biragaragara, naho, ibi birashoboka.
This is not easy.	Ibi ntabwo byoroshye.
She is scared today.	Afite ubwoba uyu munsi.
I hope you want to say something else.	Nizere ko ushaka kuvuga ikindi.
It's not just about the day.	Ntabwo ari kuvuga umunsi gusa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ahari kubona ibintu byiza.
You can talk, you can talk, you can talk.	Urashobora kuvuga, urashobora kuvuga, urashobora kuvuga.
He wants to stay.	Ashaka kuguma.
But it's really good.	Ariko ni mwiza rwose.
You have to get it.	Ugomba kubona.
There was only one thing he could do.	Hariho ikintu kimwe gusa yashoboraga gukora.
Only.	Gusa.
He knew the woman better than he did his father.	Yari azi umugore neza kuruta uko yari azi se.
Who knows what would have happened then.	Ninde uzi uko byari kugenda icyo gihe.
But the truth is.	Ariko ukuri ni ukuri.
I have the same problem.	Mfite ikibazo kimwe.
Very soon	Vuba cyane.
I like to eat food.	Nkunda kurya ibiryo.
You have a family.	Ufite umuryango.
Good boy	Umuhungu mwiza.
However, we are here.	Ariko, turi hano.
John was there.	Yohana yari ahari.
You can do things right.	Urashobora gukora ibintu neza.
It was good.	Byari byiza.
I didn't even want to talk to him.	Sinifuzaga no kuvugana na we.
That's right- this is not about me.	Nibyo rwose, birashoboka.
In fact, it is not.	Mubyukuri, sibyo rwose.
Later, perhaps, when alone.	Nyuma, birashoboka, iyo ari wenyine.
It was good though.	Byari byiza ariko.
He did not ask anything.	Nta na kimwe yabajije.
You are one of me.	Uri umwe muri njye.
He can see something beforehand.	Arashobora kubona ikintu mbere.
You want	Urashaka.
But I don’t want to be here.	Ariko ntashaka kuba hano.
This is true.	Iki ni ukuri.
I was scared.	Nagize ubwoba.
In fact, they were good friends.	Mubyukuri, bari inshuti nziza.
It was hard to walk.	Byari bigoye kugenda.
I don't know what they would be like today.	Sinzi icyo bari kuba uyu munsi.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ni umugore mwiza.
We really have to do something.	Tugomba rwose gukora ikintu.
I can do nothing.	Ntacyo nshobora gukora.
I didn't see anyone.	Nta muntu nabonye.
We have a problem.	Dufite ikibazo.
I know there is a family here.	Nzi ko hari umuryango uri hano.
He thought about it.	Yatekereje kuri ibyo.
He was not happy.	Ntabwo yishimiye.
But we have to do it right now.	Ariko tugomba kubikora neza ubu.
This morning, he was not in his room.	Muri iki gitondo, ntabwo yari mu cyumba cye.
It's good.	Ni mwiza.
That's not a concern.	Ibyo ntabwo ari impungenge.
I did not hear.	Ntabwo numvise.
And it's the same.	Kandi ni kimwe.
She was so beautiful.	Yari mwiza cyane.
He doesn't want to be alone.	Ntashaka kuba wenyine.
I love children.	Nkunda abana.
You can be human.	Urashobora kuba umuntu.
I had a house.	Nari mfite inzu.
He was not one person, he was many.	Ntabwo yari umuntu umwe, yari benshi.
I can't even do it.	Sinshobora no kubikora.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Ibyo byari ukuri, mubyukuri ikintu cyiza.
Not many things.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byinshi.
That's really good.	Nibyiza rwose.
In the end there is no top.	Amaherezo nta hejuru.
I think he did well, in fact.	Ndatekereza ko yakoze neza, mubyukuri.
Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord, Lord of lords.	Nibyo, ni byiza.
But that was good.	Ariko ibyo byari byiza.
I have a lot.	Mfite byinshi.
He knew he needed help.	Yari azi ko akeneye ubufasha.
But he never did.	Ariko ntiyigeze abikora.
You are not sure what he means.	Ntabwo uzi neza icyo ashaka kuvuga.
He wanted to go home.	Yashakaga gutaha.
This is not a problem.	Ibi ntabwo ari ibibazo.
There is also mental drive.	Hariho kandi gutwara ubwenge.
She is scared.	Afite ubwoba.
He knows he has a house.	Azi ko afite inzu.
A lot of money would be coming soon.	Amafaranga menshi yaba vuba aha.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
You have to make any book.	Ugomba gukora igitabo icyo ari cyo cyose.
I can't do that.	Sinshobora kugira ibyo.
You have to know how difficult this is for me.	Ugomba kumenya uburyo ibi bigoye kuri njye.
If we are lucky, we should be.	Niba dufite amahirwe, tugomba.
Very good.	Byiza cyane.
It’s not just food.	Ntabwo ari ibiryo gusa.
He is your age.	Afite imyaka yawe.
Mary today.	Mariya iki gihe.
But a woman is beautiful.	Ariko umugore ni mwiza.
But, that's just what he told me.	Ariko, nibyo gusa yambwiye.
I don't know what to do.	Sinzi icyo gukora.
I heard a child.	Numvise umwana.
I would go.	Nari kugenda.
Now too.	Ubu na byo.
It was difficult.	Yari bigoye.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ufite ubwoba gusa ko akiri muto cyane.
I don't know, really.	Sinzi, mubyukuri.
Fear is real.	Ubwoba ni ukuri.
However, this is not always the case.	Ariko, ntabwo buri gihe aribyo.
He thought it was a good thing.	Yatekereje ko ari ikintu cyiza.
It was all one by one for everyone.	Byose byari kuri umwe numwe kuri bose.
That was good.	Ibyo byari byiza.
I made a lot of money.	Nabonye amafaranga menshi.
Making my mistakes.	Gukora amakosa yanjye.
Buying top clothes.	Kugura imyenda yo hejuru.
I think that's a prison.	Ntekereza ko iyo ari gereza.
It wouldn't work.	Ntabwo byari gukora.
We have to see.	Tugomba kubona.
This was too much.	Ibi byari byinshi cyane.
Good luck to him.	Amahirwe kuri we.
Especially not your child.	Cyane cyane ntabwo ari umwana wawe.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nta kintu na kimwe gusa.
His daughter.	Umukobwa we.
Obviously that is it.	Biragaragara ko aribyo.
To live.	Kubaho.
You have to have a lot of food.	Ugomba kugira ibiryo byinshi.
He will be alone.	Azaba wenyine.
There is no basement.	Nta cyumba cyo hasi cye.
Not a big deal all day long.	Ntabwo ari ikintu kinini umunsi wose.
To go	Kugenda.
He knows everything.	Azi icyo aricyo cyose.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Birashoboka ko ari byiza nanjye.
He had nothing.	Nta kintu na kimwe yari afite.
He had been out for a long time.	Yari amaze igihe kinini hanze.
I am your family.	Ndi umuryango wawe.
In fact, he is a good young man.	Mubyukuri, ni umusore mwiza.
I'm sure it is.	Nzi neza ko ari.
He just thought he was a bad person.	Yatekereje gusa ko ari umuntu mubi.
And this.	Kandi ibi.
I know everyone here.	Nzi abantu bose bari hano.
I want to talk to you.	Ndashaka kuvugana nawe.
But he was a good man.	Ariko yari umuntu mwiza.
No one was scared.	Nta muntu n'umwe wigeze agira ubwoba.
Everyone thinks you can do more.	Umuntu wese atekereza ko ushobora gukora byinshi.
These are people.	Aba ni abantu.
But he must be right.	Ariko agomba kuba afite ukuri.
I'm sure I am.	Nzi neza ko ndi.
I did nothing behind.	Ntacyo nakoze inyuma.
Eating too much is not good.	Kurya byinshi ntabwo ari byiza.
That's right.	Nibyo.
Me too, obviously.	Nanjye, biragaragara.
Something together.	Ikintu hamwe.
All they have is money.	Ibyo bafite byose ni amafaranga.
I do not know.	Ntabwo nzi.
That's right.	Ibyo ni ukuri.
For him, this is not a big deal.	Kuri we, iki ntabwo ari ikintu kinini.
I don't have to.	Ntacyo ngomba.
He was about to give up this.	Yari agiye kureka ibi.
He felt very bad about that.	Yumvise nabi cyane kuri ibyo.
I can't do well.	Sinshobora gukora neza.
Obviously not.	Biragaragara ko atari byo.
It's up to me.	Ari kuri njye.
She thinks she is not alone.	Yibwira ko atari we wenyine.
I am not one.	Ntabwo ndi umwe.
He has been telling the truth all this time.	Yavuze ukuri muri iki gihe cyose.
I think it's really good.	Ntekereza ko ari byiza rwose.
Everything went really well.	Ibintu byose byagenze neza rwose.
I work in film.	Nkora muri firime.
That is.	Icyo aricyo.
He heard a lot.	Yumvise cyane.
You don’t like to do outerwear.	Ntabwo ukunda gukora imyenda yo hanze.
I know what he told me.	Nzi ibyo yambwiye.
We have no time.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya.
And it was good.	Kandi byari byiza.
It's an opportunity.	Ni amahirwe.
You never wanted to.	Ntabwo wigeze ushaka.
He was also worried.	Na we yari afite impungenge.
He would not go.	Ntiyari kugenda.
Near the bus.	Hafi ya bisi.
He just wants to be something.	Ashaka gusa kuba ikintu.
We don’t have time to go into that.	Ntabwo dufite umwanya wo kujya muri ibyo.
I enjoy reading and you are doing well.	Nishimiye gusoma urimo ukora neza.
I'm here to stay.	Ndi hano kuguma.
I know each one of them.	Nzi buri kimwe muri byo.
We have to work.	Tugomba gukora.
It's your age.	Ni imyaka yawe.
He had already done so.	Yari amaze kubikora.
My house is not far away.	Inzu yanjye ntabwo iri kure.
But not much.	Ariko si byinshi.
Not always good.	Ntabwo buri gihe ari byiza.
This is a bad thing.	Iki kintu kibi.
At all times	Igihe cyose.
There are many cars.	Hariho imodoka nyinshi.
I really want to live.	Ndashaka kubaho rwose.
I wonder what he wants me to do today.	Ndabaza icyo ashaka ko nkora uyu munsi.
He thought badly.	Yatekereje nabi.
But it’s just obvious.	Ariko biragaragara gusa.
Friends on this issue.	Inshuti kuri iki kibazo.
He didn't need to do it.	Ntiyari akeneye kubikora.
What we need now is time.	Icyo dukeneye ubu ni igihe.
It was easy to see.	Byari byoroshye kubona.
He was in the same room.	Yari mu cyumba kimwe.
I don’t do a lot of problems.	Ntabwo nkora ibibazo byinshi.
Maybe they would do it now.	Birashoboka ko bari kubikora ubu.
This alone is not good.	Ibi gusa ntabwo ari byiza.
You want	Urashaka.
Take care.	Gufata neza.
He was a good player.	Yari umukinnyi mwiza.
It was very easy for that.	Byari byoroshye cyane kubyo.
I am happy for the opportunity.	Nishimiye amahirwe.
But none of that would have come.	Ariko nta na kimwe muri ibyo aricyo yari kuza.
Too long	Igihe kirekire cyane.
And you have to do the same.	Kandi nawe ugomba kubikora.
Anyone here can do it.	Umuntu wese uri hano arashobora kubikora.
That's all he said, and it was true.	Nibyo yavuze byose, kandi byari ukuri.
I'm glad he came.	Nishimiye ko yaje.
There is so much to do.	Hariho byinshi byo gukora.
No one to see.	Nta muntu wo kubona.
I think you can win.	Ndatekereza ko ushobora gutsinda.
But there is nothing to see.	Ariko nta kintu cyo kubona.
Not good at all.	Ntabwo ari byiza na gato.
I need advice.	Nkeneye inama.
It will be a good thing.	Bizaba ikintu cyiza.
I ask if he is scared.	Ndabaza niba afite ubwoba.
He wants to go out.	Arashaka kujya hanze.

Good thing.	Ikintu cyiza.
He is walking, walking, walking.	Arimo kugenda, kugenda, kugenda.
You can't do it alone.	Ntushobora kubikora wenyine.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Kumva ari ukuri.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Nibyiza yari gukora ubu.
I got the idea.	Nabonye igitekerezo.
And you can.	Kandi urashobora.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Kumenya neza, ntabwo aribyo.
I am your son.	Ndi umuhungu wawe.
He said there was.	Yavuze ko ahari.
It is not an easy task.	Ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye gukora.
Of that, there is a lot to come.	Muri ibyo, hari byinshi byo kuza.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
He never left.	Ntiyigeze agenda.
You are doing well here.	Ukora neza hano.

At the same time.	Igihe kimwe.
He has one of those.	Afite kimwe muri ibyo.
And none of us are alone.	Kandi nta n'umwe muri twe uri wenyine.
He is right.	Avuga ukuri.
Most people have no job.	Abantu benshi nta kazi bafite.
But this one, he was right.	Ariko uyu, yari afite ukuri.
He wanted a school.	Yashakaga ishuri.
I mean, in fact, everything.	Ndashaka kuvuga, mubyukuri byose.
They are just children.	Ni abana gusa.
That's not what he expected.	Ntabwo aribyo yari yiteze.
Probably a lot.	Birashoboka ko ari byinshi.
Maybe together we can figure this out.	Ahari hamwe dushobora kumenya iki kintu.
That's really good.	Nibyiza mubyukuri.
As we should.	Nkuko tugomba.
He did not expect much.	Ntabwo yari yiteze byinshi.
He had people.	Yari afite abantu.
You are not sure where they are.	Ntabwo uzi neza aho bari.
He doesn’t want to work hard.	Ntabwo yifuza gukora cyane.
Absolutely.	Hariho rwose.
He knew he had nothing out there.	Yari azi ko ntacyo afite hanze aha.
However, it is possible.	Ariko, birashoboka.
No phone.	Nta terefone.
He may not be able to read.	Birashoboka ko adashobora gusoma.
I know this is just a week away.	Nzi ko iki ari iki cyumweru gusa.
Or he tried.	Cyangwa yagerageje.
What to do, what to do.	Icyo gukora, icyo gukora.
I like work.	Nkunda akazi.
You need them to be close.	Ukeneye ko aba hafi.
He did just that.	Yabikoze gutya.
You want more.	Urashaka byinshi.
I'm glad he chose to stay.	Nishimiye ko yahisemo kuguma.
That is good.	Kuba ari byiza.
It was a great experience to see.	Byari ibintu byiza cyane kubona.
That's good.	Nibyiza.
Obviously.	Biragaragara.
There is a truth.	Hariho ukuri.
I'm talking to you on the phone.	Ndimo kuvugana nawe kuri terefone.
We have to talk.	Tugomba kuvuga.
He has to play well.	Agomba gukina neza.
There is more here.	Hano hari byinshi.
This is absolutely possible.	Ibi birashoboka rwose.
He saw nothing.	Nta na kimwe yabonye.
It's too early.	Ni kare cyane mugihe.
I can walk.	Nshobora kugenda.
I'm worried about us.	Mfite impungenge kuri twe.
But he is right.	Ariko afite ukuri.
I think you should get your money's worth.	Ntekereza ko ugomba kubona amafaranga yawe ukora.
That's right.	Nibyo rwose.
Quit.	Kureka.
Up or out.	Hejuru cyangwa hanze.
The woman seemed worried.	Umugore yasaga naho afite impungenge.
Not on this phone.	Ntabwo kuri iyi terefone.
There is always so much to do and see and hear.	Buri gihe hariho byinshi byo gukora no kubona no kumva.
They were both friends.	Bombi bari inshuti.
I never liked it, never.	Sinigeze nkunda, nta na rimwe.
You are wrong.	Ufite nabi.
It would not take long.	Ntabwo byari gufata igihe kirekire.
If he had the opportunity, it would not have gone backwards.	Niba yagize amahirwe, ntabwo byari gusubira inyuma.
And you are here.	Kandi uri hano.
I can't live well.	Ntabwo nshobora kubaho neza.
I am different however.	Ndi ikindi ariko.
He was lucky.	Yari yagize amahirwe.
And he had to have a reason.	Kandi yagombaga kugira impamvu.
He doesn't know much.	Ntabwo azi neza.
In a short time.	Mu gihe gito.
This was really easy.	Ibi rwose byari byoroshye cyane.
This is not difficult.	Ibi ntabwo bigoye.
I don't think he can do it.	Ntatekereza ko ashobora kubikora.
One can walk at any time.	Umuntu arashobora kugenda igihe icyo aricyo cyose.
They are children.	Ni abana.
Probably.	Birashoboka.
But, not really.	Ariko, ntabwo mubyukuri.
I can't say that.	Sinshobora kuvuga gutya.
That's not it.	Ntabwo aribyo.
Everyone however.	Umuntu wese ariko.
All day long	Umunsi wose.
But he was really.	Ariko yari arimo rwose.
From school to now.	Kuva ku ishuri kugeza ubu.
Like him, he would see nothing.	Nka we, ntacyo yari kubona.
He thought that would happen.	Yatekereje ko ibyo byari kubaho.
You're going to do well.	Ugiye gukora neza.
Maybe he had something.	Birashoboka ko hari icyo yari afite.
Not so, not now.	Ntabwo ari ibi, si ubu.
I hope we all are.	Nizera ko twese turi.
I wanted to be there.	Nashakaga ko ahari.
He went like this.	Yagiye gutya.
You need help.	Niwowe ukeneye ubufasha.
You know that.	Uzi ko aribyo.
And not just me.	Kandi si njye gusa.
They didn't know what the plan was.	Ntabwo bari bazi icyo gahunda yakoze.
Everyone has to do that.	Umuntu wese agomba gukora ibyo.
I don't know your plan.	Sinzi gahunda yawe.
He knew everything.	Yari azi ibyo aribyo byose.
It's the same every morning.	Ni kimwe buri gitondo.
But his bottom line is the same.	Ariko munsi ye ni kimwe.
She is not a woman, or a child.	Ntabwo ari umugore, cyangwa umwana.
You can do it.	Urashobora gukora.
But in reality, it was too much.	Ariko mubyukuri, byari byinshi cyane.
We have to think about it today.	Tugomba gutekereza muri iki gihe.
Probably a family affair.	Birashoboka umuryango.
That's a lot of people.	Ibyo ni abantu benshi.
He will do it.	Azabikora.
Not much.	Ntabwo ari byinshi.
He didn't look good.	Ntabwo yari asa neza.
He has a car.	Afite imodoka.
There is one girl.	Hariho umukobwa umwe.
Well, at least you didn't go down without explaining yourself first.	Nibyiza, urimo kwiga.
There is always tomorrow.	Buri gihe hariho ejo.
Until he was ready.	Kugeza igihe yari yiteguye.
Maybe he was right.	Birashoboka ko yari afite ukuri.
Who we need to find.	Uwo tugomba kubona.
He thought.	Yatekereje.
That he was a gift.	Ko yari impano.
No need to look.	Nta mpamvu yo kureba.
That's not all.	Ntabwo aribyo gusa.
He was out.	Yari hanze.
Same problem.	Ikibazo kimwe.
If he had a reason to be.	Niba yari afite impamvu yo kuba.
All together	Bose hamwe.
You have to find someone.	Ugomba kubona umuntu.
It wouldn't help then.	Ntabwo byari gufasha icyo gihe.
Everyone really has something.	Umuntu wese rwose afite icyo aricyo cyose.
It will be good.	Bizaba byiza.
My house was upstairs.	Inzu yanjye yari hejuru.
It's good.	Ndi mwiza.
Tell me more about that.	Mbwira byinshi kuri ibyo.
But no one.	Ariko nta muntu n'umwe.
I'm not far away.	Ntabwo ndi kure.
You can get your chance later.	Urashobora kubona amahirwe yawe nyuma.
Now, he can't play at all.	Ubu, ntashobora gukina na gato.
For him.	Kuri we.
You would do the same for each of us.	Wari kubikora kuri buri wese muri twe.
All right and good.	Byose neza kandi byiza.
It is also better than usual.	Nibyiza kandi kurenza uko byari bisanzwe.
He is also young.	Na we muto.
In fact they had.	Mubyukuri bari bafite.
Uri.	Uri.
More than anyone.	Byinshi kurenza umuntu uwo ari we wese.
There is no time to win.	Nta gihe cyo gutsinda.
And that distance is good.	Kandi uko kure ni byiza.
He was the only one.	Yari we wenyine.
No one was scared.	Nta n'umwe yagize ubwoba.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndakeka ko aricyo kintu cyiza.
