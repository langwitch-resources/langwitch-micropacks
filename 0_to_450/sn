You have to take a chance.	Unofanira kutora mukana.

Waiting for an answer.	Akamirira mhinduro.

Then he left.	Akabva aenda.
But especially for me.	Asi kunyanya kwandiri.
And it is true.	Uye ichokwadi.

But he is not.	Asi haasi.
He does his job.	Anoita basa rake.
He decided to help the dog.	Akafunga kubatsira imbwa.
It doesn't make sense.	Hazvina musoro.
He was gone for a long time.	Akanga aenda kwenguva refu.
He wanted to believe.	Aida kutenda.
But I did not find a better answer to that.	Asi handina kuwana mhinduro iri nani pane izvi.
I have only mine.	Ndine yangu chete.
Good living.	Kugara zvakanaka.
And a woman.	Uye mukadzi .
I felt that food was good.	Ndakanzwa kuti chikafu chakanaka.
He has gone too far.	Aenda kure kure.
Does anyone really know this answer ?.	Pane anoziva mhinduro iyi zvechokwadi?.
But this was only superficial.	Asi izvi zvakanga zviri pamusoro chete.
Again, that’s fine, good.	Zvakare, izvo zvakanaka, zvakanaka.
I wanted to work a little harder.	Ndaida kushanda zvishoma.
No time.	Hapana nguva.
We did not speak for long.	Hatina kutaura kwenguva refu.

And you may even be doing that.	Uye unogona kunge uri kuita izvozvo.

This is obvious.	Izvi zviri pachena.

Probably all that.	Pamwe zvose izvozvo.
Maybe a little bit.	Pamwe zvishoma.
I do not have a girlfriend.	Handina musikana.

We have a point here.	Tine musoro pano.
No one is buying anything.	Hapana ari kutenga chinhu.
And he wanted to.	Uye aida.

They are better than that.	Vari nani pane izvozvo.
I did not ask for anything.	Handina kukumbira kana chimwe chinhu.
Or to do something.	Kana kuita chimwe chinhu.
Only there was more to it than that.	Chete zvakanga zvakawanda kupfuura izvozvo.
He did not seem to be.	Aiita seasina kudaro.
Police, they need police.	Mapurisa, anoda mapurisa.

Everyone needs money.	Munhu wese anoda mari.

This is what he wanted.	Izvi ndizvo zvaaida.

There is little to do.	Pane zvishoma zvekuita.

He has to worry.	Anofanira kunetseka.
He was really good.	Aive akanaka zvechokwadi.
Not that he didn't care.	Kwete kuti akanga asina basa nazvo.

He had never done that before.	Akanga asina kumbobvira aita izvozvo.
Not this, either.	Kwete izvi, zvakare.
That's enough.	Izvo zvakakwana.
He decided to find another house.	Akafunga kutsvaga imwe imba.
No one is driving.	Hapana ari kutyaira.

He went to work.	Akaenda kubasa.
These are good things.	Izvi zvinhu zvakanaka.

He did not say that he knew.	Haana kuti aiziva zvake.
Walking with him for a long time.	Kufamba naye kwenguva refu.
Well, that's all true.	Zvakanaka, zvese izvo ichokwadi.
You can say anything.	Unogona kutaura chero chinhu.
Good way.	Nzira yakanaka.

This does not make sense to me.	Izvi hazvina musoro kwandiri.
And a great opportunity.	Uye mukana mukuru.
I felt good walking again.	Ndakanzwa zvakanaka kufamba zvakare.
It's not fair at all.	Hazvina kunaka zvachose.
But I want to find another way.	Asi ndinoda kuwana imwe nzira.
But he could not stop thinking about it.	Asi haana kukwanisa kurega kufunga nezvazvo.
Everyone is like that.	Munhu wese akadaro.
You can't talk.	Iwe haugone kutaura.
And a good one, too.	Uye imwe yakanaka, zvakare.
I wanted to be someone else.	Ndaida kuva mumwe munhu.

You are not a woman.	Iwe hausi mukadzi.
They did not come.	Havana kuuya.
Maybe you were at work.	Pamwe wanga uri kubasa.
But he wanted to know more.	Asi aida kuziva zvakawanda.

He waited for his answer.	Akamirira mhinduro yake.
Please, please, please.	Ndapota, ndapota, ndapota.
I want that at some point.	Ndinoda izvozvo pane imwe nguva.
Well, here we are again.	Zvakanaka, tiri pano zvakare.

We could not get out.	Hatina kukwanisa kubuda.
Not there.	Kwete ipapo.
No one knew anything.	Hapana aiziva chinhu.
Nothing is close enough.	Hapana chiri pedyo zvakakwana.
But he didn't.	Asi akanga asina.
He should go now.	Anofanira kubva aenda iye zvino.
I think you are doing a good job.	Ndinofunga uri kuita basa rakanaka.
Probably a little younger.	Pamwe mudiki zvishoma.
I have to say.	Ndinofanira kutaura.
You have no choice.	Hauna sarudzo.
But there is more to it than that.	Asi zvakawanda kupfuura izvozvo.
I was not happy about that.	Handina kufara nazvo.
Why you ?.	Sei iwe?.
But this is now uncertain.	Asi izvi zvino hazvina chokwadi.
I'm doing it anyway.	Ndiri kuzviita zvakadaro.
It seems so.	Zvinoita zvakadaro.
Long, long.	Nguva yakareba, yakareba.
This did not help.	Izvi hazvina kubatsira.
And there is only one way to do it.	Uye pane nzira imwe chete yekuita izvozvo.

Then again, he was not thinking too much.	Ipapo zvakare, akanga asiri kufunga zvakanyanya.
Or a boy.	Kana mukomana.
Of course now, his.	Chokwadi zvino, zvake.

Another saw a house.	Mumwe akaona imba.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.

You want that, too.	Unoda izvozvo, zvakare.
He just stared.	Akatarisa zvake.

No one should do that.	Hapana anofanira kuita izvozvo.
He did not want to go back.	Haana kuda kudzokera.

You have to do something about it.	Unofanira kuita chimwe chinhu nezvazvo.
Acceptance is not.	Kubvuma hapana.

He wanted her to go.	Aida kuti aende.
He never thought about it.	Akanga asina kumbofunga nezvazvo.

Well, he said.	Zvakanaka, akadaro.
I can't say good enough things about it.	Handikwanise kutaura zvinhu zvakanaka zvakakwana nezvazvo.
But no one else can do it.	Asi hapana mumwe munhu anogona kuzviita.

It happened again and again.	Zvakaitika zvakare uye zvakare.
There is a reason.	Pane chikonzero.
And he is still with me.	Uye achiri neni.
But a little harder.	Asi zvishoma zvakaoma.
Good work.	Basa rakanaka.

He loves me, not him.	Anoda ini kwete iye.
And there is no reason.	Uye hapana chikonzero.
Quitting or trying.	Kurega kana kuedza.
That is completely absurd.	Izvo zvachose hazvina musoro.
He did not need to know why.	Aisafanira kuziva chikonzero.

People are saying that it is a good thing.	Vanhu vari kuti chinhu chakanaka.

And he could not do that.	Uye haana kukwanisa kuita izvozvo.
Not just anyone.	Kwete chero munhu.
And that doesn't make sense.	Uye izvozvo hazvina musoro.
You must not stop learning.	Haufanire kurega kudzidza.

If his doctor knew.	Dai chiremba wake aiziva.
He said.	Akadaro.
And he did not do that for anyone else.	Uye haana kuita izvozvo kune mumwe munhu.

Another man was.	Mumwe murume akanga ari.
Outside, outside, outside.	Kunze, kunze, kunze.

And he did worry.	Uye akaita kunetseka.
Well, he was here.	Zvakanaka, akanga ari pano.
No speech.	Hapana kutaura.

I do not understand why he is here.	Handisi kunzwisisa kuti sei ari pano.
Perfect and beautiful.	Yakakwana uye yakanaka.
He didn't deal with it.	Haana kuita basa nazvo.
You know you want to !.	Unoziva kuti unoda!.
She's a little, but pretty.	Ari zvishoma, asi akanaka.
Or the money.	Kana kuti mari yacho.
Of course you know.	Chokwadi unoziva.
You are very lucky.	Une rombo rakanaka.

These are some of the bigger things.	Izvi zvimwe zvinhu zvikuru chaizvo.

The older woman lives alone.	Mukadzi mukuru anogara ega.
You love the truth.	Unoda chokwadi.
Well everyone.	Zvakanaka munhu wese.

You can feel that he was a good man.	Unogona kunzwa kuti aive munhu akanaka.

You are nothing to me.	Hausi chinhu kwandiri.
These are very good things.	Izvi zvinhu zvakanaka chaizvo.

No answer!	Hapana mhinduro!
He had no wife or story.	Aive asina mukadzi kana nyaya.
I want to talk.	ndinoda kutaura.
Is it enough?	Yakakwana here?
He didn't get that.	Haana kuwana izvozvo.
He did not believe me.	Haana kutenda kuti ndini.
There is something working.	Pane chimwe chinhu chiri kushanda.
They say everything is fine.	Vari kuti zvinhu zvese zvakanaka.
But the truth is far from it.	Asi chokwadi chiri kure nazvo.
It's not easy, but it's easy.	Hazvisi nyore, asi zviri nyore.
That's exactly what to say.	Ndizvo chaizvo kutaura.
I did not ask.	handina kukumbira.
One way.	Imwe nzira.
Not that, though.	Kwete izvozvi, zvakadaro.
You have to start from the ground.	Unofanira kutanga kubva pasi.

And tomorrow.	Uye mangwana.
Whether all or not.	Kana zvese kana kwete.
You can stay there.	Unogona kugara ipapo.
Not that.	Kwete izvozvo.
And he doesn't care about it.	Uye haana basa nazvo.
Everyone was watching.	Munhu wese akanga akatarisa.
I can say this, but for no reason.	Ndinogona kutaura izvi, asi hapana chikonzero.
But maybe another way is coming.	Asi pamwe pane imwe nzira iri kuuya.
I have another chance.	Ndine mumwe mukana.
I can leave at any time.	Ndinogona kubva chero nguva.
I did that, it didn't work.	Ndakaita izvozvo, hazvina kushanda.
Nice house, and nice house.	Imba yakanaka, uye imba yakanaka.
He thought so.	Akafunga kudaro.
He is doing a good job.	Ari kuita basa rakanaka.
He refused to walk.	Akaramba kufamba.
I was not asleep.	Ndakanga ndisina kurara.
I don't like that.	Handifarire kudaro.
I guess he doesn't want to tell me.	Ndofunga haadi kundiudza.

But no, no nothing.	Asi kwete, kwete hapana.
Tom was simply not there.	Tom aive asipo zvake.
It was hard to say.	Zvakanga zvakaoma kutaura.
It's not at all.	Hazvisi zvachose.
Of course, you can get that easily.	Chokwadi, unogona kuwana izvo zviri nyore.
He knows best.	Anoziva zvakanyanya.
And the issue.	Uye nyaya yacho.
But everything else, too.	Asi zvimwe zvese, zvakare.
I still try to understand why she did that.	Ndichiri kuedza kunzwisisa kuti sei akadaro.
You are young.	Iwe uri mudiki.
I'm afraid to sleep.	Ndinotya kurara.
What a fine man you are.	Uri murume akanaka sei.
No problem with that.	Hapana dambudziko nazvo.
This is not true at all.	Izvi hazvisi zvechokwadi zvachose.
He needs to know.	Anofanira kuziva.
But we must.	Asi tinofanira.
I'm sure he shouldn't.	Ndine chokwadi chekuti haafanire kudaro.
Great woman.	Mukadzi mukuru.
He knew it was true.	Aiziva kuti ichokwadi.

Anyone can do it.	Chero ani zvake anogona kuzviita.
Then he made another one.	Akabva aita imwe.

And we all know what will happen then.	Uye tese tinoziva zvichaitika ipapo.
It doesn't matter, really.	Hazvina basa, chaizvo.

That's what you are.	Ndizvo zvauri.
There is more going on here.	Pane zvimwe zviri kuitika pano.
She tried to help the child.	Akaedza kubatsira mwana.
But that is not the case.	Asi izvozvo hazvisi izvo.
One thing is for sure.	Chinhu chimwe chokwadi.
And now you.	Uye zvino iwe.
'work'.	'basa'.
I did not want to.	Ndaisada.
A lot has happened to me.	Zvakawanda zvakaitika kwandiri.

But he has a point.	Asi ane pfungwa.
And yet we are here, he said.	Uye zvakadaro tiri pano, akadaro.
Surprisingly, he had no friends.	Hameno kuti aive asina shamwari.
He looked asleep.	Akatarisa akarara.
However.	Zvakadaro.

His car, no.	Motokari yake, kwete.
And it is very close.	Uye iri pedyo zvikuru.
He thought he was something else.	Akafunga kuti aive chimwe chinhu.

But something there.	Asi chimwe chinhu ipapo.
But, of course, he had to go.	Asi, chokwadi, aifanira kuenda.

If so, fine.	Kana zvakadaro, zvakanaka.
And he did not do a very good job.	Uye haana kuita basa rakanaka kwazvo.
It happened a long time ago.	Zvakaitika kare kare.
But it did not happen.	Asi hazvina kuitika.
He does everything in his own time.	Anoita zvese nenguva yake.
Friend is true.	Shamwari ichokwadi.

It is not good to have anything on your own.	Hazvina kunaka kuwana chero chinhu ndega.

I hope you are doing well.	Ndinovimba uri kuita zvakanaka.
But that is not the case.	Asi hazvina kudaro.
And the man was gone.	Zvino murume akanga aenda.
Probably more often.	Pamwe kakawanda.
He can really do it.	Anogona chaizvo kuita.
No way, no way.	Hapana nzira, hapana nzira.
He refused to admit the problem.	Akaramba kubvuma dambudziko.
He knew how to do so much.	Aiziva kuita zvakawanda kudaro.
And again and again and again and again.	Uye zvakare uye zvakare uye zvakare uye zvakare.
He's been here ever since.	Anga ari pano kubva ipapo.
He started walking away.	Akatanga kufamba achienda.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
And that happened in the past.	Uye izvozvo zvakaitika kare.
It is not that simple.	Hazvisi nyore kudaro.
This he cannot do.	Izvi haakwanisi kuita.
I want to be on this.	Ndinoda kuva pane izvi.
There is nothing good or bad.	Hapana chakanaka kana chakaipa.
And space.	Uye nzvimbo.

There is nobody here.	Hapana munhu pano.
You can come.	Unogona kuuya.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka kwazvo.

But that did not last long.	Asi izvozvo hazvina kugara kwenguva refu.
He must try to understand.	Anofanira kuedza kunzwisisa.
That we are seeing.	Kuti tiri kuona.
He has faith that it will happen again.	Ane kutenda kuti zvichaitika zvakare.
It is not just money.	Haisi mari chete.
The evening had arrived.	Manheru akanga asvika.
Not one.	Hapana kana mumwe chete.
He could not.	Haana kukwanisa.
He needed friends.	Aida shamwari.
They are.	Vari.
And you didn't do it.	Uye iwe hauna kuzviita.
But you can go far.	Asi unogona kuenda kure.
Maybe he's asleep now.	Pamwe akarara manje.
Who lives nearby?	Ndiani anogara pedyo?
What is he seeing now?	Iye zvino ari kuona chii?
He can be everything.	Anogona kuva zvose.
Maybe it does.	Pamwe zvinoita.
Maybe at some point.	Pamwe pane imwe nguva.
No one told me that.	Hapana akandiudza izvozvo.
But there is something else.	Asi pane chimwe chinhu.
We do not have much time.	Hatina nguva yakawanda.
I thought you were.	Ndaifunga kuti ndiwe.
We can go.	Tinogona kuenda.
But, that doesn't make sense.	Asi, izvozvo hazvina musoro.
He was still.	Akanga achiri.

We have that.	Tine izvozvo.
But he had to understand.	Asi aifanira kunzwisisa.
He was not walking.	Akanga asiri kufamba.
He can come from anywhere.	Anogona kubva chero kupi.
The answer is obvious.	Mhinduro iri pachena.

You can be a boy.	Unogona kuva mukomana.
He must be near.	Anofanira kuva pedyo.
Good work.	Basa rakanaka.
I don't have my time.	Handina nguva yangu.
No one cares.	Hapana ane hanya naye.
It is wrong to know.	Chakaipa kuziva.
We don't care about that.	Hatina basa nazvo.
There is nothing better to do.	Hapana chinhu chiri nani kuita.
I care.	Ndine hanya.
Now we have.	Zvino isu tine .
The process is simple and straightforward.	Nzira yacho iri nyore uye iri nyore.
We have to go there.	Tinofanira kuenda ikoko.
I do not know what he will do.	Handizivi kuti achaita sei.
And he.	Uye iye.
I do not know how to love a man.	Handizivi kuda murume.
The choice is up to you !.	Sarudzo iri kwauri!.
I don't know what's going on.	Handizivi kuti chii chiri kuitika.
It's harder than that.	Zvakaoma kupfuura izvozvo.
Said the teacher.	Akadaro mudzidzisi.
You need to talk to him.	Unofanira kutaura naye.
And one more thing.	Uye chimwe chinhu.
I am looking for a house.	Ndiri kutsvaga kutenga imba.
You can find that much more easily.	Iwe unogona kuwana izvo zvakanyanya zvakanyanya nyore nyore.
We are strong.	Isu tiri simba.
But it seems that you have not.	Asi zvinoita sekuti hauna kudaro.
He was still dressed.	Akanga achiri akapfeka.
It is easier said than done.	Zviri nyore kutaura pane kuita.
Not that.	Kwete izvozvo.
Who knew you had more.	Ndiani aiziva kuti une zvakawanda.
That is not the case.	Handizvo zviri izvi.
I hope he can get a job soon.	Ndinovimba kuti anogona kuwana basa nekukurumidza.
I have to go back, he thought.	Ndinofanira kudzokera, akafunga kudaro.
I don't know what it is.	Handizivi kuti chii.
I have that.	Ndine izvozvo.
Not me.	Kwete ini.
He had to do this quickly.	Aifanira kuita izvi nekukurumidza.
But he could speak.	Asi aigona kutaura.
You will be better than my friend here.	Unenge uri nani pane shamwari yangu pano.
They're making a baby.	Vari kuita mwana.
You can leave here tomorrow.	Unogona kubva pano mangwana.
Can't sleep on this one.	Iwe haugone here kurara pane iyi.
Of course he was.	Chokwadi aiva.
He saw his point.	Akaona pfungwa yake.
He had his way with her.	Akanga ane nzira yake naye.
They did not cause trouble.	Havana kuita dambudziko.
Probably no one knew.	Pamwe hapana aiziva.
But now he is about to start.	Asi iye zvino ava kuda kutanga.
I heard it before.	Ndakanzwa kare.
He had to wait for something again.	Aifanira kumirira chimwe chinhu zvakare.
He had to make his decision.	Aifanira kuita sarudzo yake.
No one can hear.	Hapana anogona kunzwa.
He has been alone for a long time.	Ave ari ega kwenguva refu kwazvo.
And no.	Uye kwete.
You have a feeling.	Une kunzwa.
She expected him to be.	Aitarisira kuti ndiye.
I think that's a good thing to do.	Ndinofunga kuti chinhu chakanaka kuita.
Only one person in the household could do that.	Munhu mumwe chete mumba ndiye aizoita izvozvo.
But she was not worried.	Asi akanga asina kunetseka.
I love that.	Ndinoda izvozvo.
Well, he might have a point.	Zvakanaka, angave ane pfungwa.
He wanted something, he wanted something.	Aida chimwe chinhu, aida chimwe chinhu.
Easy it is much better.	Nyore iri nani zvikuru.

Maybe he was a man.	Pamwe aive murume.
How beautiful she was.	Aive akanaka sei.
But we have to start somewhere.	Asi tinofanira kutanga pane imwe nzvimbo.
And again.	Uye zvakare.
The “officer” supervises the official.	“Mukuru mukuru” anotarisira mukuru mukuru.
I thought it was good.	Ndakafunga kuti zvakanga zvakanaka.

However.	Zvakadaro.

It was good, but not good.	Zvakanga zvakanaka, asi kwete zvakanaka.
He can't do that.	Haakwanisi kudaro.
I wanted a way.	Ndaida nzira.
Perhaps this is what is happening.	Pamwe ndizvo zviri kuitika izvi.
But something is happening here.	Asi chimwe chinhu chiri kuitika pano.

But not everything is easy.	Asi zvese hazvisi nyore.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Haazivi zviri kuitika.
They did not come out on time.	Havana kubuda nenguva.

Instead, this is what happened.	Pane kudaro, izvi ndizvo zvakaitika.
But not so much.	Asi kwete zvakanyanya.
You have no answer to that.	Hauna mhinduro pane izvozvo.
Do you need more?	Unoda zvimwe here?

He wanted to be alone.	Aida kuva oga.
Love, love, love !.	Kuda, kuda, kuda!.
He did not make his own money.	Haana kuita mari yake ega.

Everyone has a story.	Munhu wese ane nyaya.

He had to be somebody else.	Aifanira kuva mumwe munhu.

I have no problem with that	Ini handina dambudziko nazvo
It was morning.	Akanga ari mangwanani.
I wonder what he will do with it	Hameno kuti achaita sei nazvo
He does not know who he is.	Haazivi kuti ndiani.

If there is anyone.	Kana kune chero ani zvake.
You can do this easily at home.	Unogona kuita izvi nyore kumba.

And that's fine with it.	Uye zvakanaka nazvo.
But it is not there.	Asi hazvisi ipapo.
They did nothing.	Havana kuita chero chinhu.

I can see he doesn't	Ndinogona kuona kuti haadi
There, he thought.	Ikoko, akafunga.
Just a little.	Zvishoma.
I want to be the one to do that	Ndinoda kuva iye anoita izvozvo
You can return there, please.	Unogona kudzokera ikoko, ndapota.
One boy looked like a man.	Mumwe mukomana aiita kunge murume.
She is the only child.	Ndiye ega mwana.
Less than anything.	Zvishoma pane chinhu.
I had to do it myself	Ndaifanira kuzviita ndega
Not sure why or how.	Hazvina chokwadi kuti sei kana sei.
And this time, he didn't care.	Uye panguva iyi, akanga asina basa nazvo.
I am a young child.	Ndiri mwana mudiki.
Well, he thinks.	Zvakanaka, anofunga.
I had no answer.	Ndakashaya mhinduro.
I had none of that	Ndakanga ndisina kana zvakadaro
You know more, it does.	Iwe unoziva zvakanyanya, zvinoita.
He is gone now.	Aenda zvino.
But it is not.	Asi handizvo.
I could be far, far away	Ndinogona kunge ndiri kure, kure
And he did not.	Uye haana kuzviita.
It could be just me.	Ndinogona kunge ndiri ini chete.
Surprisingly, she was a woman.	Hameno kuti aive mukadzi.
Am i right.	Ndizvo here.

I don't have that.	Ini handina izvozvo.
To be honest, it doesn't matter.	Kutaura chokwadi, hazvina basa.
Nothing.	Hapana chinhu.
I don't have that.	Ini handina izvozvo.
You have to accept it.	Unofanira kubvuma.
That is not true today.	Izvozvo hazvisi zvechokwadi nhasi.
That way is better.	Kuti nzira iri nani.
We have to go, 'he said.	Tinofanira kuenda,' akadaro.
Only a woman.	Mukadzi chete.
We know they live here.	Tinoziva kuti vari kugara pano.
But no one is guilty of such wrongdoing.	Asi hapana ane mhosva kudaro.
I had no chance	Ndakanga ndisina kana mukana
But he wanted to get out.	Asi aida kubuda.
He had no one.	Akanga asina mumwe.
No one was home at the time.	Hapana aiva pamba panguva iyoyo.
But not me.	Asi kwete ini.
That is certainly happening now.	Chokwadi ndizvo zviri kuitika iye zvino.
Whatever the reason, it is not working.	Chero chikonzero, hazvisi kushanda.
We have to go.	Tinofanira kuenda.
Power and issues.	Simba uye nyaya.
Anytime, anywhere.	Chero nguva, chero kupi.
I want to help.	Ndinoda kubatsira.
I did not try to find a job	Handina kuedza kutsvaga basa
I wanted to read more	Ndaida kuverenga zvimwe
I wanted the money.	Ndaida mari yacho.
I think you know what to do	Ndinofunga unoziva zvekuita
First, he was not a good doctor.	Kutanga, akanga asiri chiremba akanaka.
No one knew.	Hapana aiziva zvake.
That did not take long.	Izvozvo hazvina kutora nguva refu.
I think he is telling the truth	Ndinofunga ari kutaura chokwadi
I saw my opportunity	Ndakaona mukana wangu
He looked good.	Aiita kunge akanaka.
I want to do it myself.	Ndinoda kuzviita ini.
But you are lucky.	Asi une rombo rakanaka.
I think anyone can see that	Ndinofunga chero munhu anogona kuona izvozvo
I know where you are going	Ndinoziva zvauri kuenda
And yet.	Uye zvakadaro.
I had to find out what it was	Ndaifanira kutsvaga kuti chii
I have to believe that.	Ndinofanira kutenda izvozvo.
That's what's happening.	Ndizvo zviri kuitika.
But he can.	Asi anogona kudaro.
I think he needs friends.	Ndinofunga kuti anoda shamwari.
Just a little.	Zvishoma.
Maybe too much sleep, work or eating.	Pamwe kunyanya kurara, kushanda kana kudya.
They did not get a chance.	Havana kuwana mukana.
I have to go home	Ndinofanira kudzokera kumba
But first, he needed money.	Asi kutanga, aida mari.
This does not work.	Izvi hazvisi kushanda.
But not everything.	Asi kwete zvose.
I think it's hard	Ndinofunga kuti zvakaoma
I'm looking forward to the same thing.	Ndiri kutarisira chinhu chimwe chete.
He asked again.	Akabvunza zvakare.
Such a good person.	Munhu akanaka akadaro.

He is not sorry.	Haana urombo.
Again, he said no.	Zvakare, akati kwete.
We know the truth.	Tinoziva chokwadi.
From one place to another.	Kubva pane imwe nzvimbo kuenda kune imwe.
I really want to talk to her.	Chokwadi ndinoda kutaura naye.
I want to try again tomorrow morning	Ndinoda kuedza zvakare mangwana mangwanani
Now he could see that he was gone.	Zvino akanga ava kuona kuti akanga aenda.
I can't, I can't.	Handikwanise, handikwanise.
Probably not.	Pamwe hazvina kunaka.
I can believe this	Ndinogona kutenda izvi
He knew to try.	Akaziva kuedza.
I hope you can	Ndinovimba iwe unogona kudaro
I think this is what works	Ndinofunga kuti izvi ndizvo zviri kuita basa
The same thing happened last week.	Zvakadaro zvakaitika svondo rapfuura.
I felt, in general, well	Ndakanzwa, kazhinji, zvakanaka
Well, he had it too.	Zvakanaka, aive nazvo zvakare.
And he certainly was not.	Uye zvechokwadi akanga asiri izvozvo.
Common sense.	Zviri pachena.
I'm going tonight	Ndiri kuenda manheru ano
Good tonight.	Yakanaka manheru ano.
I'm feeling better.	Ndiri kunzwa zviri nani.
I'm sure the answer to this is very good.	Ndine chokwadi kuti mhinduro kune izvi yakanaka chaizvo.
People are here.	Vanhu vari pano.
But things are coming.	Asi zvinhu zviri kuuya.

He said it happened quickly.	Akati zvakaitika nekukurumidza.
I want to be close to you	Ndinoda kuva pedyo newe
I did not get an answer	Handina kuwana mhinduro
He may say that something is wrong.	Anogona kutaura kuti pane chiri kuitika.
Is true.	Ichokwadi.
He thought quickly.	Aifunga nekukurumidza.
I saw no one	Ndakaona pasina kana munhu
And not just work.	Uye kwete basa chete.
I know you have to do it	Ndinoziva kuti unofanira kuzviita
I was still young at the time	Ndakanga ndichiri mudiki panguva iyoyo
I wonder who did that	Hameno kuti ndiani akaita izvozvo
He was good to me.	Aive akanaka kwandiri.
Then you.	Ipapo iwe.
He said he was.	Akati aiva.
This was very good.	Izvi zvakanga zvakanaka kwazvo.
I didn't say that	Handina kutaura izvozvo
I think you need something	Ndinofunga kuti unoda chimwe chinhu
And only him.	Uye iye chete.
I did nothing	Handina kuita chero chinhu
You don't.	Iwe hauna.
That is exactly what happened.	Ndizvo chaizvo zvakaitika.
And you should have been his friend.	Uye waifanira kunge uri shamwari yake.
I am innocent	handina mhosva zvachose
Eating good food.	Kudya chikafu chakanaka.
Maybe he was asleep	Pamwe akanga akarara
I had to find those things	Ndaifanira kutsvaga zvinhu izvozvo
Probably not, he thought.	Pamwe haasi, akafunga kudaro.
You have to work with us.	Unofanira kushanda nesu.
I've gotten better since then	Ndave nani kubva ipapo
And that is what happened.	Uye ndizvo zvakaitika.
And he saw that he was much better.	Uye akaona kuti akanga ari nani zvikuru.
And that's fine.	Uye zvakanaka.
From there we can go very, very far.	Kubva ipapo tinogona kuenda zvakanyanya, zvachose.
Somewhere that doesn't make sense.	Pane imwe nzvimbo izvo hazvina musoro.
You need money.	Unoda mari.
I know what you are doing	Ndinoziva kwauri kuita
She's pretty.	Anenge akanaka.
That didn't help much.	Izvo hazvina kunyanya kubatsira.
I can't work.	Handikwanise kushanda.
A man should not want too much.	Murume haafaniri kuda zvakawanda.
I'm trying to do one	Ndiri kuedza kuita imwe
And it is working.	Uye zviri kushanda.
You have a lot to do.	Une zvakawanda zvekuita.
He admitted that he had a point.	Akabvuma kuti ane pfungwa.
I did not want to go	Ndaisada kuenda
Very good idea.	Pfungwa yakanaka kwazvo.
He knew that.	Aiziva izvozvo.
It's not easy being me.	Hazvisi nyore kuva ini.
It is not easy to understand.	Hazvisi nyore kunzwisisa.
That he had not heard.	Kuti akanga asina kunzwa.
There is nothing better than that.	Hazvina nani kupfuura izvozvo.
I'm shopping tonight.	Ndiri kutenga manheru ano.
The girl is very nice	Musikana akanaka chaizvo
More often than not.	Kazhinji kupfuura izvozvo.
I never thought about it at all	Handina kumbofunga nezvazvo zvachose
I know you think you are weak	Ndinoziva kuti unofunga kuti hauna simba
I had no idea.	Ndakanga ndisina pfungwa.
I want to find my way	Ndinoda kutsvaga nzira yangu
He did not get enough sleep.	Akanga asina kurara zvakakwana.
This is certainly not a new concept.	Chokwadi iyi haisi pfungwa itsva.
I want to say something.	Ndinoda kutaura chimwe chinhu.
He did not want to.	Akanga asingadi.
I want to work on those other things.	Ndinoda kushanda pane izvo zvimwe.
It was much harder than that.	Zvakanga zvakaoma zvikuru kupfuura izvozvo.
That's all you're asking for.	Ndizvo zvauri kukumbira chete.
I'm not going back to school	Handisi kudzokera kuchikoro
But that is not what happened.	Asi izvi handizvo zvakaitika.
But it is still true.	Asi ichokwadi zvakadaro.
And it will happen.	Uye zvichaitika.
That doesn't make sense to me then.	Izvozvo hazvina musoro kwandiri ipapo.
I hope they could not speak	Ndinovimba havana kukwanisa kutaura
I can't even understand why this is happening	Handikwanise kana kunzwisisa kuti sei izvi zviri kuitika

All or none here.	Zvose kana kuti hapana pano.

I really wanted to talk to her	Ndaida chaizvo kutaura naye
But he did not go far.	Asi haana kuenda kure.
And, a little bit, he can't do that.	Uye, zvishoma, haakwanisi kudaro.
I hope every night it doesn't	Ndinovimba manheru ega ega hazvina kudaro
This is difficult to do.	Izvi zvakaoma kuita.
You can be someone else.	Unogona kuva mumwe munhu.
I am so happy!	Ndiri kufara chaizvo!
I did not understand this	Handina kunzwisisa izvi
He lived there for three years.	Akagara ikoko kwemakore matatu.

He thought this was close and good.	Akafunga izvi zviri pedyo uye zvakanaka.

I didn’t want to work on one	Ndaisada kushanda pane imwe
I can't think of that	Handisi kukwanisa kufunga izvozvi
He was not the one who would do this.	Akanga asiri iye achaita izvi.

I saw what it was.	Ndakaona kuti chii.
He really wants to be very close.	Anoda zvikuru kuva pedyo zvikuru.
I have no problem.	Handina kana dambudziko.
Now you can get out.	Iye zvino unogona kubuda.
They don't care about it.	Havana basa nazvo.
I can’t stop thinking about it	Handigoni kurega kufunga nezvazvo
It could be him.	Anogona kunge ari iye.

That is not the same.	Izvozvo hazvisi zvimwe chete.
That was really good.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka chaizvo.
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Akandiudza kuti aida kutaura neni.

He had done well.	Akanga aita zvakanaka.
But really, really good to be here.	Asi chaizvo, zvakanaka chaizvo kuva pano.
That was very difficult.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakaoma zvikuru.
I can't tell you why.	Handikwanise kukuudza chikonzero nei.
Maybe he could.	Zvimwe aigona.
They are looking for power.	Vari kutsvaga simba.

I wanted an answer.	Ndaida mhinduro.
You can feel it.	Unogona kunzwa.

He can read people.	Anoziva kuverenga vanhu.
He was her husband.	Aiva murume wake.
And it was hard.	Uye zvakanga zvakaoma.
They didn't do it.	Havana kuzviita.
I wondered why he had not come	Ndakashaya kuti sei akanga asina kuuya

You are right.	Une chokwadi.
It's hard to start.	Zvakaoma kutanga.
That's the same thing.	Ndizvo zvimwe chete.
People are looking for beauty.	Vanhu vari kutsvaga kunaka.
But it doesn't matter anymore.	Asi hazvina basa zvakare.
He was young and very handsome.	Akanga ari mudiki uye akanaka chaizvo.
He was, too.	Akanga ari, zvakare.

I have to say something.	Ndinofanira kutaura chimwe chinhu.
We are on time.	Tiri panguva.
Not everything, though.	Kwete zvose, zvakadaro.

You're just a boy.	Uri mukomana chete.
Or maybe he's asleep.	Kana kuti zvimwe akarara.
He was doing his job.	Aiita basa rake.

You probably have a good reason.	Zvimwe une chikonzero chakanaka.
This is the place to do such things.	Iyi ndiyo nzvimbo yekuita zvinhu zvakadaro.

I hope you can understand	Ndinovimba unogona kunzwisisa
I love that.	Ndinoda izvozvo.
He was very close.	Akanga ari pedyo zvikuru.
I realized that something was wrong.	Ndakaona kuti pane chakaipa.
It is much more difficult than that.	Zvakaoma zvikuru kupfuura izvozvo.
Or so he thought.	Kana kuti akafunga kudaro.
I don't know why exactly.	Handizivi kuti sei chaizvo.
No way.	Hapana nzira.
But it is not easy	Asi hazvisi nyore
She is doing well.	Ari kuita zvakanaka.
And now it is not.	Uye zvino hazvisi.
But to be honest, he did.	Asi kutaura chokwadi, akadaro.
I can tell you one thing	Ndinogona kukuudza chinhu chimwe
There is no way to do anything at this time.	Hapana nzira yekuita chero chinhu panguva ino.
But it is better.	Asi zviri nani.
But how he was.	Asi aive sei.
What a fine man he was, he thought.	Aive murume aive akanaka sei, aifunga.
I may not have the strength for it.	Ndinogona kunge ndisina simba racho.

I'm afraid what will happen	Ndinotya zvichaitika
I had not felt this well for years	Ndanga ndava nemakore ndisina kunzwa zvakanaka izvi
That's it.	Ndizvo zviri.
He had to stay here.	Aifanira kugara pano.
I knew that was what he wanted	Ndakaziva kuti ndizvo zvaaida
I'm fine.	Ndiri zvakanaka.
There is no reason.	Hapana chikonzero.
And he is not talking.	Uye haasi kutaura.
I don't have time to do that again	Handina nguva yekuita izvozvo zvakare
The woman.	Mukadzi.
You are not going there.	Iwe hausi kuenda ikoko.

Not all together.	Kwete zvose pamwe chete.
But that is over.	Asi izvo zviri pamusoro.
He is eating this morning.	Ari kudya mangwanani ano.
And there is plenty of time.	Uye pane nguva yakawanda.
And one more thing.	Uye chimwe chinhu.
But no, that's not easy.	Asi kwete, hazvisi nyore kudaro.
But there is not much about it.	Asi hapana zvakawanda nezvazvo.
He didn't care about it.	Akanga asina basa nazvo.
I knew the reason.	Ndaiziva chikonzero.
He lived there for three years	Akagara ikoko kwemakore matatu
I do not want to.	Ini handidi.
I can do it myself	Ndinogona kuzviita ini
I had to tell someone	Ndaifanira kuudza mumwe munhu
This is easy to do.	Izvi zviri nyore kuita.
I hope he got the answer and is doing better	Ndinovimba akawana mhinduro uye ari kuita zviri nani
It's close to me.	Zviri pedyo neni.

And you can tell me, too.	Uye iwe unogona kundiudza, zvakare.

You can come there.	Unogona kuuya ipapo.
You can see there.	Unogona kuona ipapo.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
To be honest, there are some things that work here.	Kutaura chokwadi, pane zvimwe zvinhu zviri kushanda pano.
A woman is no better than a man.	Mukadzi haasi nani pane murume.
I thought he was coming	Ndaifunga kuti anenge asvika
Desire to learn.	Kuda kudzidza.
I didn't see what it was	Handina kuona kuti chii

Morning and evening.	Mangwanani uye manheru.
Again he got no answer.	Zvakare haana kuwana mhinduro.
At that point.	Panguva iyoyo.
You are a good child.	Uri mwana akanaka.

But they are not sure.	Asi havana chokwadi.

He did not realize that he had nothing to do with it.	Haana kuona kuti akanga asina basa nazvo.

He was far from her alone.	Akanga ari kure naye ega.
It's not the way.	Haisi nzira.
I think that's fine	Ndinofunga kuti zvakanaka
He wasn't coming out.	Akanga asiri kubuda.
I can tell you that now	Ndinogona kukuudza izvozvi
And there is nothing you or anyone else can do about it.	Uye hapana chimwe chinhu iwe kana chero ani zvake anogona kuita nezvazvo.
I like to do things	Ndinoda kuita zvinhu
Things will happen from now and then.	Zvinhu zvichaitika kubva zvino uye ipapo.
I could not speak	Handina kukwanisa kutaura
Or he told me he was.	Kana kuti akandiudza kuti ndiye.
He cannot walk for long.	Haakwanisi kufamba kwenguva refu.
I think he would have told me that	Ndofunga angadai akandiudza izvozvo
I want to be close to him	Ndinoda kuva pedyo naye
I could have done this.	Ndingadai ndakaita izvi.
Now you have to get out of here.	Zvino unofanira kubva pano.
That's a good thing.	Ndizvo zvinhu zvakanaka.

Only people.	Vanhu chete.
He felt better.	Akanzwa zviri nani.
I did not want to have a baby.	Ndaisada kuita mwana.
Her husband was one.	Murume wake aive mumwe.
And we could not get an answer.	Uye hatina kukwanisa kuwana mhinduro.
I am still searching for answers	Ndichiri kutsvaga mhinduro
I'm sorry that this happened to you	Ndine urombo kuti izvi zvakaitika kwauri
I don't know why.	Handizivi kuti sei.
It's hard to be close.	Zvakaoma kuva pedyo.
I love that so much	Ndinoda izvozvo zvakanyanya
I was skeptical.	Ndakanga ndisina chokwadi.
He was young.	Aive mudiki.
I have to be better than that	Ndinofanira kuva nani pane izvozvo
I know you want to have sex with me	Ndinoziva kuti unoda kurara neni
Another woman, an older woman, is coming to me	Mumwe mukadzi, mukadzi mukuru, ari kuuya kwandiri
Time after time.	Nguva nenguva.
I knew it had to be you	Ndakaziva kuti waifanira kunge uri iwe
I thought you wanted to be alone	Ndaifunga kuti unoda kuva wega
Nobody knew he was here.	Hapana aiziva kuti akanga ari pano.
Long way.	Nzira refu.
He left without any choice.	Aenda asina kana sarudzo.
What if it is.	Ko kana zvakadaro.
I can't do that from here.	Handikwanisi kuita izvozvo kubva pano.
I need help with this	Ndinoda rubatsiro pane izvi
It is not new.	Haisi itsva.
He was lucky.	Akaita rombo rakanaka.
He was not very happy with you.	Haana kufara newe zvakanyanya.
I have to stop thinking about it	Ndinofanira kurega kufunga nezvazvo
I wanted to, but I could not do it	Ndaida, asi handina kukwanisa kuzviita
I have to admit that	Ndinofanira kubvuma izvozvo
Walk every morning.	Kufamba mangwanani oga oga.
I hope we are not too worried	Ndinovimba hatina kunyanya kunetseka
He knew the truth too.	Aiziva chokwadi zvakare.
So it is with you.	Zvakadaro kwauri.
I didn't get an answer, but it was good	Handina kuwana mhinduro, asi zvakanga zvakanaka
The child was alone.	Mwana akanga ari ega.
That's my fault.	Ndiyo mhosva yangu.
Afternoon.	Masikati.
But we did not do this.	Asi isu hatina kuita izvi.
I thought she was his wife	Ndakafunga kuti aiva mukadzi wake
I could not tell the truth	Handina kukwanisa kutaura chokwadi
Hard, hard.	Zvakaoma, zvakanyanya.
Maybe better than anyone.	Pamwe zviri nani kupfuura chero ani zvake.
But it is still happening.	Asi zviri kuitika zvakadaro.
Not enough, but perfect enough.	Kwete zvakakwana, asi zvakakwana zvakakwana.
That doesn't matter to me.	Izvo hazvina basa neni.
He needs time.	Anoda nguva.
I don't think this place is better for you	Handifungi kuti nzvimbo ino iri nani kwauri
But that is what happened.	Asi ndizvo zvakaitika.
I know he is not close to me.	Ndinoziva kuti haasi pedyo neni.
I can't believe it	Handigoni kutenda
Probably a lot now.	Pamwe zvakawanda zvino.
You can drive.	Unogona kutyaira.
And he got money from somewhere.	Uye akawana mari kubva kune imwe nzvimbo.
This is happening now.	Izvi zviri kuitika zvino.
I want to do this.	Ndinoda kuita izvi.
It was him or us.	Aive iye kana isu.
But not the best.	Asi kwete zvakanyanya kunaka.
He probably never thought about it that way.	Pamwe anga asiri kumbofunga nezvazvo zvakadaro.
Again, the police refused.	Zvakare, mapurisa akaramba.
Such a beautiful house.	Imba yakanaka kudaro.
Probably not.	Zvimwe kwete zvakadaro.
But now you have to tell me the truth.	Asi zvino unofanira kundiudza chokwadi.

That's the point.	Ndiyo pfungwa yacho.
He is not alone.	Haana ega.
If it is good.	Kana zvakanaka.
I want to be able to do that.	Ndinoda kukwanisa kuita izvozvo.
And then and another.	Uye ipapo uye imwe.
Not so much, either.	Kwete zvakanyanya, zvakare.
It was easy.	Zvakanga zviri nyore.
This is not what he wanted right now.	Izvi handizvo zvaaida izvozvi.
I am not a doctor.	Ini handisi chiremba.
But there is another reason.	Asi pane chimwe chikonzero.
I can live with it	Ndinogona kugara nazvo
What he wanted.	Zvaaida.
We all know this.	Izvi tose tinoziva.
You especially.	Iwe kunyanya.
He had to be good.	Aifanira kuva akanaka.

It doesn't matter to me.	Hazvina basa neni.
Yesterday again.	Nezuro zvakare.
I am a good person.	Ndiri munhu akanaka.
I don't like being around her.	Handifarire kuva pedyo naye.
I can tell you from experience that this is difficult.	Ndinogona kukuudza kubva pane zvakaitika kuti izvi zvakaoma.
I have to be with him a lot.	Ndinofanira kuva naye zvakanyanya.
That's all right.	Zvakanaka chete.
I should have been here earlier	Ndaifanira kunge ndiri pano kare
I would, however.	Ndinoda, zvakadaro.
And no, you can't.	Uye kwete, haugone.
I can't do that, not now	Handikwanisi kuita izvozvo, kwete iye zvino
I can’t take much with me anyway	Handikwanisi kutora zvakawanda neni zvakadaro
I wanted to go home at that time	Ndaida kuenda kumba panguva iyoyo
I would not have stayed long	Ndingadai ndisina kugara kwenguva yakareba
I wondered if it was the same one	Ndakashaya kuti ndiyo imwe chete here
I have to tell you.	Ndinofanira kukuudza.

The harder, the better.	Zvakaoma, zviri nani.

But tonight he was skeptical.	Asi manheru ano anga asina chokwadi.
But he could do this.	Asi aigona kuita izvi.
Not that he has to speak.	Kwete kuti anofanira kutaura.
And he was a great player.	Uye aive mutambi mukuru.
And for nothing.	Uye pasina.
I'm looking forward to knowing.	Ndiri kutarisira kuziva.
Certainly not good.	Zvechokwadi hazvina kunaka.
But he could not agree.	Asi haana kukwanisa kubvuma.
He was here.	Akanga ari pano.
But we can start.	Asi tinogona kutanga.
From there.	Kubva ipapo.
That was not done.	Izvo hazvina kuitwa.
I was still young at the time	Ndakanga ndichiri mudiki panguva iyoyo
There or not.	Ikoko kana kwete.
There is somebody there.	Pane mumwe munhu ipapo.
If so, you are in good company.	Kana zvakadaro, une rombo rakanaka.
Anyone can see why.	Chero ani zvake anogona kuona chikonzero.
That's exactly right.	Ichokwadi chaizvo.
He could not come to me.	Haana kukwanisa kuuya kwandiri.
He could not sit still.	Haana kukwanisa kugara pasi.
I think everyone has their own	Ndinofunga munhu wese ane yake
But he was definitely not there.	Asi chokwadi akanga asipo.
I don’t know much about it.	Handizivi zvakawanda nezvazvo.
No one knew the truth.	Hapana aiziva chokwadi.
It was him.	Akanga ari iye.
He got what he wanted.	Akawana zvaaida.
I want some time away	Ndinoda imwe nguva kure
He has to do this alone.	Anofanira kuita izvi ari ega.
Not a very good job.	Kwete basa rakanaka kwazvo.
Not so.	Hazvina kudaro.
And she was very beautiful.	Uye akanga akanaka kwazvo.
Now that is difficult.	Zvino izvo zvakaoma.
He thought he wanted to go home.	Akafunga kuti aida kuenda kumba.
I felt lucky.	Ndakanzwa rombo rakanaka.
He had no chance.	Akanga asina mukana.
We can go home right now.	Tinogona kuenda kumba izvozvi.
I thought he would like to go with us	Ndakafunga kuti angada kuenda nesu
I can only tell you this	Ndinogona kukuudza chete izvi
That was good.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka.
I can't believe good luck	Handigoni kutenda rombo rakanaka
I like to think more and do less.	Ndinoda kufunga zvakanyanya uye kuita zvishoma.
It doesn't matter why.	Hazvina basa kuti sei.

Something is happening.	Pane chiri kuitika.

That did not happen.	Izvo hazvina kuitika.
I do not know when and how	Handizivi kuti rinhi uye sei
I don’t and I don’t.	Handina uye handidi.
He wanted a great man.	Aida murume mukuru.
We can go back to that.	Tinogona kudzokera kune izvozvo.
And all is well.	Uye zvose zvakanaka.
Good luck.	Rombo rakanaka.
He is the only one.	Ndiye chete.
I did not think so.	Handina kufunga kudaro.
That's the only answer.	Ndiyo mhinduro chete.
Of course there is no passage of time.	Chokwadi hapana kufamba kwenguva.
But he wasn't.	Asi akanga asiri.
It is not that simple.	Haisi nyore kudaro.
He was here, and he was not.	Akanga ari pano, uye akanga asipo.
I hope you have time	Ndinovimba une nguva
This happened several times.	Izvi zvakaitika kakawanda.
Happy working with him	Kufara kushanda naye
I can't ask for anything	Handikwanisi kukumbira chimwe chinhu
I don't want to, that's true	Handidi, ichokwadi
This is not the case.	Izvi hazvina kudaro.
I missed one	Ndakashaya imwe
What is happening seems simple.	Zviri kuitika zvinoita kunge zviri nyore.
I want to be a boy.	Ndinoda kuva mukomana.
From home.	Kubva kumba.
Not only, no, no.	Kwete chete, kwete, kwete.
All right, all right.	Zvakanaka, zvakanaka.
He was not a good man at heart.	Akanga asiri munhu ane pfungwa.
But, maybe not.	Asi, pamwe kwete.
I can wait, either way	Ndinogona kumirira, chero nzira
Not much, but better.	Kwete zvikuru, asi zviri nani.
More, less.	Zvakawanda, zvishoma.
You can start tomorrow.	Unogona kutanga mangwana.
Not you or him.	Kwete iwe kana iye.
He has been away for a long time.	Ave asipo kwenguva refu.
There is nothing without that.	Hapana chinhu pasina izvozvo.
He has a girlfriend.	Ane musikana .
And no one saw anything.	Uye hapana akaona chinhu.
I do not know who he is	Handizivi kuti ndiani
You can stay.	Unogona kugara.
We have something for everyone !.	Tine chimwe chinhu kune wese munhu!.

And that is no better.	Uye izvo hazvina kana nani.
I know who you are now	Ndinoziva kuti ndiwe ani zvino
Of course I felt that there was more.	Chokwadi ndakanzwa kuti pane zvakawanda.
He has nothing.	Haana chinhu.
And he does not know if he will ever care for it.	Uye haazivi kana angave ane hanya nazvo.
I did not have much time	Handina nguva refu
And here we can do more.	Uye pano tinogona kuita zvakawanda.
I would not have agreed.	Ndingadai ndisina kubvuma.
Now you want to do it again.	Iye zvino unoda kuzviita zvakare.
I have for some time been without that	Ndave nenguva ndisina izvozvo
I felt surprised	Ndakanzwa kushamisika
I think, the sooner, the better	Ndinofunga, nokukurumidza, zviri nani
But it doesn't matter now.	Asi hazvina basa manje.
There is no other way.	Hapana imwe nzira.
I know you can read this.	Ndinoziva kuti unogona kuverenga izvi.
You have to come.	Unofanira kuuya.

Some good.	Zvimwe zvakanaka.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka kwazvo.
There is no one better than he	Hapana mumwe munhu ari nani kupfuura iye
That's all.	Ndizvo chete.
This is difficult.	Izvi zvakaoma.
I know it's not you.	Ndinoziva kuti hausi iwe.
But that is not the case.	Asi izvozvo hazvisi kuitika.
I hope he is doing well	Ndinovimba ari kuita zvakanaka
From there, however, he stayed.	Kubva ipapo, zvakadaro, akagara.
And it was good.	Uye zvakanga zvakanaka.
I can't do any more	Handigoni kuita zvimwe
No one can know.	Hapana anogona kuziva.
I thought he was young	Ndaifunga kuti aiva mudiki
But no one knows anything.	Asi hapana anoziva chinhu.
This is your home too.	Iyi ndiyo imba yako zvakare.
I wish we had one here	Ndinoshuva kuti dai tine imwe pano
But, this is better.	Asi, izvi zviri nani.
I did not want to know.	Ndaisada kuziva.
He can do that.	Anogona kuita izvozvo.
I want to see that.	Ndinoda kuona izvozvo.

This is not easy.	Izvi hazvisi nyore.

Such a good boy.	Mukomana akanaka kudaro.
Here I am, 'he said.	Ndiri pano,' akadaro.
I don't think you are to blame	Handifungi kuti ndiwe une mhosva
It's easy to go.	Zviri nyore kuenda.
This is not an easy time.	Ino haisi nguva iri nyore.
I know this is not his house	Ndinoziva kuti iyi haisi imba yake
And he wanted it to be himself.	Uye aida kuti ave iye.
I than him.	Ini kupfuura iye.

Not that he was.	Kwete kuti aiva .
He did not want to do it.	Akanga asingadi kuzviita.
I'm the only one, though.	Ndini chete, zvakadaro.
I had to buy time	Ndaifanira kutenga nguva
The answer is very simple.	Mhinduro yacho iri nyore chaizvo.
I guess it's that simple.	Ndinofungidzira zviri nyore kudaro.
You have nothing to do with him.	Hauna kana nyaya naye.
I have a house now	Ndine imba manje
He did well there.	Akaita zvakanaka ipapo.
Good for you, but you still need friends.	Zvakanaka kwauri, asi iwe uchiri kuda shamwari.
I never thought much of it	Handina kumbofunga zvakawanda

All of this was his fault.	Zvose izvi zvakanga zviri mhosva yake.
I know a guy who's doing it	Ndinoziva mukomana ari kuzviita
I love that idea	Ndinoda pfungwa iyoyo
I can't even tell the truth there is a problem	Handikwanise kana kutaura chokwadi pane dambudziko
He could not speak.	Haana kukwanisa kutaura.
He didn't really think about it.	Akanga asina kunyanya kufunga nezvazvo.
But he could do it.	Asi aigona kuzviita.
But only today.	Asi nhasi chete.
I could not speak	Handina kukwanisa kutaura
And coming.	Uye kuuya.
That's his idea.	Ndiyo pfungwa yake.
But they did not understand.	Asi havana kunzwisisa.
Everything was fine.	Zvose zvakanga zvakanaka.
I'm sure it's good.	Ndine chokwadi kuti yakanaka.
I like to start things	Ndinoda kutanga zvinhu
I can't say anything	Handikwanisi kutaura chimwe chinhu
I think you should find someone	Ndinofunga unofanira kuwana munhu
Is true.	Ichokwadi.
Gone, gone.	Aenda, aenda.
But he had no choice.	Asi akanga asina sarudzo.
I didn't want to talk about it.	Handina kuda kutaura nezvazvo.

I can be a better man for you	Ndinogona kuva murume ari nani kwauri
I thought it was me	Ndaifunga kuti ndini
Or so.	Kana kuti akadaro.
Of course, he cannot.	Chokwadi, haakwanisi.
I wonder where he actually lives	Hameno kuti anogara kupi chaizvo
It is difficult to see why.	Zvakaoma kuona kuti sei.
This is my place.	Iyi ndiyo nzvimbo yangu.
I really am a different person	Ini zvechokwadi ndiri mumwe munhu
In that case.	Kana zvakadaro.
Next to him.	Pedyo naye.
I'm afraid, he thought.	Ndinotya, akafunga.
He's a player.	Iye mutambi.
There is enough money there.	Pane mari yakakwana ipapo.
I trust him.	Ndinovimba naye.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndinofunga kuti chinhu chakanaka.
I felt the force.	Ndakanzwa simba racho.
No one is trying to say you are not trying too hard.	Hapana ari kuedza kutaura kuti hausi kuedza zvakanyanya.
He doesn't have to be here.	Haafanire kunge ari pano.
He must be working.	Anofanira kunge ari kushanda.
He did not do that.	Haana kuita izvozvo.
She looked at her baby.	Akatarisa mwana wake.
It's like a baby.	Kunge ari kuita mwana.
But it is very good.	Asi zvakanaka chaizvo.
No money.	Pasina mari.
Good player, too	Mutambi akanaka, zvakare
I have to get out a lot.	Ndinofanira kubuda kunze zvakanyanya.

But today, here we are.	Asi nhasi, tiri pano.
We did not stay long.	Hatina kugara kwenguva refu.
Probably not.	Pamwe akanga asina.
It is not a good choice.	Haisi sarudzo yakanaka.
I like this.	Ndinoda izvi.
But for how long.	Asi kwenguva yakareba sei.
I didn't have any	Ndakanga ndisina kana imwe
Hausi.	Hausi.
Again, he waited.	Zvakare, akamirira.
Someone has to do that.	Mumwe munhu anofanira kudaro.
But that is not good enough.	Asi izvozvo hazvina kunaka zvakakwana.
The woman was still in love.	Mukadzi akanga achiri kuda.
Everything is happening.	Zvose zviri kuitika.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka chaizvo.
And he did not.	Uye haana.

Too close together.	Kunyanya pedyo pamwe.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Pamwe mangwana manheru.
That didn't work.	Izvozvo hazvina kushanda.
They are doing a good job.	Vari kuita basa rakanaka.
She was better than this.	Akanga ava nani pane izvi.
Or a child.	Kana mwana.
You can't sleep.	Iwe haugone.
This is it, now.	Izvi ndizvo, zvino.
He is a man.	Iye murume.

And he was gone.	Zvino akanga aenda.
There is a way.	Pane nzira.

Of course not.	Chokwadi kwete.

Well, maybe not.	Zvakanaka, pamwe kwete.
But there is an answer.	Asi pane mhinduro.

He promises to come out.	Haadi kubuda.
It's not good for me.	Hazvina kunaka kwandiri.
You can't sleep.	Haugone kurara.

This he did not pay attention to.	Izvi haana kuita hanya nazvo.
Maybe he couldn't talk to you.	Pamwe haana kukwanisa kutaura newe.
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.
Not much to say about it.	Kwete zvakawanda kutaura nezvazvo.
Truth for everyone.	Chokwadi kune wese wese.
And yet he loves.	Uye zvakadaro anoda.

You have your time.	Une nguva yako.
Now he could see something, but not something.	Zvino aigona kuona chimwe chinhu, asi kwete chii.
He knew better than that.	Aiziva zviri nani kupfuura izvozvo.
He knew that better than anyone else.	Aiziva izvozvo kupfuura chero ani zvake.
He looked so good.	Aiita kunge akanaka chaizvo.
We are not sure why that is so.	Hatina chokwadi kuti nei zvakadaro.

I did not find faith.	Handina kuwana kutenda.

But that doesn't say much.	Asi izvozvo hazvisi kutaura zvakawanda.
She is my girlfriend.	Ndiye musikana wangu.
I want to learn more.	Ndinoda kudzidza zvakawanda.
I just had to play with him.	Ndaifanira kutamba naye chete.
That doesn't make sense either.	Izvo hazvina musoro kana.
This is it.	Izvi ndizvo.
No one knows why.	Hapana anoziva kuti sei.

And there is not much time.	Uye hapana nguva yakawanda.
Not just any man.	Kwete chero murume.

He had to devise a plan.	Aifanira kuronga zano.
He could not believe that he was doing any study.	Haana kutenda kuti ari kuita chero kudzidza.
But they are buying.	Asi vari kutenga.
He can't find his way here.	Haakwanisi kuwana nzira yake pano.

He refused to sit down.	Akaramba kugara pasi.
And he did not go.	Uye haana kuenda.
It was easy.	Zvakanga zviri nyore.
He loved everything.	Aida zvose.

But only.	Asi chete.
He knows you can't do it.	Anoziva kuti hausi kukwanisa kuzviita.
Or he.	Kana kuti iye.

Now she was not sure if she wanted to or not.	Zvino akanga asina chokwadi chokuti aida here kana kuti kwete.
But there are many things that are hard to believe.	Asi pane zvinhu zvakawanda zvakaoma kutenda.

Indeed, he is.	Zvechokwadi, anofarira.
You can get my money.	Unogona kuwana mari yangu.

In the meantime, you can stop.	Panguva ino, unogona kurega.

But, the reason is simple.	Asi, chikonzero chiri nyore.
Surely there are better people.	Chokwadi kune vanhu vari nani.

All of this is good.	Zvose izvi zvakanaka.

And, he knew he had to do it right away.	Uye, aiziva kuti aifanira kuzviita nekukurumidza.

No one thinks he is better than anyone else.	Hapana anofunga kuti ari nani pane mumwe munhu.
If we really have.	Kana zvechokwadi tine.
Once upon a time.	Pane imwe nguva.

He could not understand my point.	Haana kukwanisa kunzwisisa pfungwa yangu.
But he can't.	Asi haakwanisi.
That's what happened to me.	Ndizvo zvakaitika kwandiri.
Not so here.	Hazvina kudaro pano.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa ipapo.
Something out there, especially.	Chimwe chinhu kunze, kunyanya.
You cannot live here alone.	Iwe haugone kugara pano wega.
He may not have known about it.	Anogona kunge asina kuziva nezvazvo.
But it doesn't have to work.	Asi haafanire kushanda.
For these people, a little harder is better.	Kune vanhu ava, zvishoma zvakaoma zviri nani.
He's not good, he thought.	Haana kunaka, akafunga.
No friends.	Hapana shamwari.
They didn't care for him.	Havana kuita hanya naye.

And they are doing that.	Uye vari kuita izvozvo.
He has to do it.	Anofanira kuita.

And you need more too.	Uye iwe unoda zvimwe zvakare.

But he was not a child.	Asi akanga asiri mwana.
Not too far away.	Kwete kure zvakanyanya.
Now we know it isn't.	Zvino tinoziva kuti hazvisi.

Then he had to go.	Ipapo aifanira kuenda.
They are beginning to know what to do.	Vari kutanga kuziva zvekuita.

But this seems to have happened.	Asi izvi zvinoita kunge ndizvo zvakaitika.
But it doesn't matter.	Asi hazvina basa.
We have to go.	Tinofanira kuenda.
There is certainly a problem with what is happening.	Zvechokwadi pane dambudziko pane zviri kuitika.
Do you have a child? ' 	Une mwana?'
He has children.	Ane vana.
I know a lot.	Ndinoziva zvakanyanya.
But this was difficult.	Asi izvi zvakanga zvakaoma.
But there is help.	Asi pane rubatsiro.
But he did not do much.	Asi haana kuita zvakawanda.
I have no strength.	Handina simba.

That's pretty cool.	Izvo zvakanyanya kunaka.
He tried anyway.	Akaedza zvakadaro.
No, no, that's fine.	Kwete, kwete, zvakanaka.
His only choice.	Sarudzo yake chete.
But you are.	Asi iwe uri.
He was not sure.	Akanga asina chokwadi.

Or maybe he wasn't.	Kana kuti zvimwe akanga asiri.
He really wanted to win.	Aida chaizvo kuhwina.
That we have more.	Kuti tine zvimwe.
He is easy to see.	Ari nyore kuona.
I'm trying to think now.	Ndiri kuedza kufunga manje.
And she was beautiful too.	Uye akanga akanaka zvakare.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa ipapo.
It is not good for anything.	Hazvina kunaka kune chimwe chinhu.
You want to take everyone with you.	Unoda kutora munhu wese newe.
I was not asleep.	Ndakanga ndisina kurara.
He is his property.	Ndiye zvinhu zvake.
No and probably not at all.	Kwete uye pamwe kwete zvachose.
This is good to know.	Izvi zvakanaka kuziva.
Are you .	Uri .
And I'm very happy too.	Uye ndinofara zvikuru zvakare.
I’m not sure we have a lot of options, though.	Handina chokwadi chekuti tine sarudzo yakawanda, zvakadaro.
It is not good to do.	Hazvina kunaka kuita.
But that is not the case.	Asi hazvina kudaro.
He wanted to eat.	Aida kudya.

He was lucky.	Akaita rombo rakanaka.

But we have one.	Asi tine imwe.
We have no other way.	Hatina imwe nzira.
I can't do it again.	Handikwanise kuzviita zvakare.
You can only go your own way.	Unogona chete kufamba nzira yako.
The same is not true here.	Zvimwe chete hazvisi chokwadi pano.
How does it work ?.	Zvinoita sei?.
No one saw it like that.	Hapana akaona zvakadaro.
I really am, he thought.	Chokwadi ndini, akafunga kudaro.
He is still in prison.	Achiri mujeri.
But she was a very beautiful woman.	Asi akanga ari mukadzi akanaka chaizvo.
And he's not doing much.	Uye haasi kuita zvakanyanya.
He needed someone.	Aida mumwe munhu.
But you have not.	Asi iwe hausati.
We have to play well.	Tinofanira kutamba zvakanaka.
I have nothing to do with myself.	Handina chinhu neni.
I have seen this from time to time.	Ndakaona izvi nguva nenguva.
But often that is not the case.	Asi kazhinji hazvina kudaro.
She must be a woman.	Anofanira kunge ari mukadzi.
Only friends, that's all.	Shamwari chete, ndizvo chete.
I wonder what is going on, or what to do.	Hameno kuti chii chiri kuitika, kana zvekuita.
But the doctor waited.	Asi chiremba akamirira.
Letter only.	Tsamba chete.
She is so beautiful, so beautiful.	Akanaka kwazvo, akanaka kwazvo.
We have to accept that.	Tinofanira kubvuma izvozvo.
No one else.	Hapana munhu oga oga.
These things are not a problem.	Zvinhu izvi hazvina dambudziko.
But you did not do that.	Asi iwe hauna kuita izvozvo.
But he was not such a child.	Asi akanga asiri mwana akadaro.
He looked at the reading.	Akatarisa kuverenga.
To try.	Kuedza.

The task is easy to understand for everyone.	Basa iri nyore kunzwisisa kune wese munhu.
You don't care about it.	Iwe hauna basa nazvo.

Anyone with good advice please.	Ani nani ane zano rakanaka ndapota.

I hope we can do it again sometime.	Ndinovimba tinogona kuzviita zvakare imwe nguva.
I am very happy.	Ndiri kufara zvakanyanya.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
He had to go now.	Aifanira kuenda zvino.
He had to talk to her.	Aifanira kutaura naye.
He didn't sleep, though.	Asina kurara, zvakadaro.
And maybe.	Uye pamwe .
Or maybe something is playing.	Kana kuti zvimwe chimwe chinhu chiri kutamba.
There are some better ones here.	Pane zvimwe zviri nani pano.
But that did not always happen.	Asi hazvina kugara zvakadaro.
But you, fine.	Asi iwe, zvakanaka.
And he did something about it.	Uye akaita chimwe chinhu nezvazvo.
I didn't want to do it.	Handina kuda kuzviita.
I wanted to think so.	Ndaida kufunga kudaro.
It has not been so today.	Hazvina kunge zvakadaro nhasi.
He did not have that power.	Akanga asina simba racho.
This morning.	Mangwanani ano .
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.

He said he was not feeling well.	Akati akanga asiri kunzwa zvakanaka.
They did not move.	Havana kufamba.

Again, this is not his fault.	Zvakare, iyi haisi mhosva yake.

Nothing is happening.	Hapana chiri kuitika.

Well, not this time.	Zvakanaka, kwete nguva ino.
But he needed more.	Asi akanga achida zvimwe.
I'm still at work.	Ndichiri kubasa.

I like the place.	Ndinoda nzvimbo.
He knew the place.	Aiziva nzvimbo iyi.
So far.	Kure kure.
I don't want to talk about it.	Handidi kutaura nezvazvo.
That does not make sense.	Izvozvo hazvina musoro.
Maybe he was all those things.	Zvimwe akanga ari zvinhu zvose izvozvo.
You can't do this to anyone.	Iwe haugone kuita izvi kune munhu.
Good to know.	Zvakanaka kuziva.

Not so.	Hazvina kudaro.
We have children but not all of us.	Tine vana asi kwete tose.
Well that's enough there.	Zvakanaka izvo zvakakwana ipapo.
Of course I am the one who imagines.	Chokwadi ndini ndinofungidzira.

He may be.	Anogona kunge ari.
That's a lot of money.	Ndiyo mari yakawanda.
He had a lot of time.	Akanga ane nguva yakawanda.

He was still far away.	Akanga achiri kure.
You're a good boy.	Uri mukomana akanaka.
I'm not playing with you.	Handisi kutamba newe.
I have nothing against him.	Ini handina kana mhosva naye.

He does that.	Anoita izvozvo.
Well, you are not.	Zvakanaka, iwe hausi.
He seemed young at the time.	Aiita kunge mudiki panguva iyoyo.
But he knew that was not the case.	Asi aiziva kuti handizvo.
And often, no.	Uye kazhinji, kwete.
And to talk about it.	Uye kutaura nezvazvo.
Well, it's easy.	Zvakanaka, zviri nyore.
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.
We know very well about you.	Tinoziva chaizvo kwauri.
He is at work.	Ari kubasa.

No one outside knows he is here.	Hapana ari kunze anoziva kuti ari pano.
You have to do it.	Unofanira kuzviita.
I have more.	Ndine zvimwe.

We can try.	Tinogona kuedza.
It's easier than that.	Zviri nyore kupfuura izvozvo.
Someone must know the truth.	Mumwe munhu anofanira kuziva chokwadi.
You are not alone.	Hausi iwe chete.
I want a good time.	Ndinoda nguva yakanaka.
It didn't take long for him to do so.	Hazvina kutora nguva yakareba kana akadaro.
That did not happen.	Izvozvo hazvina kuitika.
Why it happened.	Sei zvakaitika.
I found it to be good.	Ndakaona kuti yakanaka.
No, not really.	Kwete, kwete chaizvo.
I hope you can do it.	Ndinovimba unogona kuzviita.
That does not make sense.	Izvozvo hazvina musoro.
And he didn't want to.	Uye akanga asingadi.
I do not know enough.	Handizivi zvakakwana.
No, please no.	Kwete, ndapota kwete.
He tried everything.	Akaedza zvose.
I'm so happy, of course.	Ndinofara zvikuru, chokwadi.
There is more, too.	Pane zvakawanda, zvakare.
There is another answer.	Pane imwe mhinduro.
He knows where.	Anoziva kupi.
You are a man.	Iwe ndiwe murume.
Maybe he knew everything.	Pamwe aiziva zvese.
You have to wait.	Unofanira kumirira.
But that is not the case.	Asi hazvina kudaro.
You can do a lot.	Unogona kuita zvakawanda.
I'm not sure.	Handina chokwadi.
He looked around the room.	Akatarisa mumba.
Again, it's not fair.	Zvakare, hazvina kunaka.
It was hard to take at that time.	Zvakanga zvakaoma kutora panguva iyoyo.
I can be anyone.	Ndinogona kuva chero munhu.
Together it was a good afternoon.	Pamwe chete aiva masikati akanaka.
It's fine.	Zvakanaka.
He was doing well.	Akanga achiita zvakanaka.
He certainly has a good idea.	Chokwadi ane pfungwa yakanaka.
They don't care about us.	Havana basa nesu.
But it is not going well.	Asi haisi kufamba zvakanaka.
Living alone.	Kugara wega.
I really wanted that time.	Ndaida chaizvo nguva iyoyo.
And just fine.	Uye zvakanaka chete.
I'm not that young.	handisi mudiki kudaro.
You love yourself.	Unoda wega.
I wanted to come home.	Ndaida kuuya kumba.
I can't do that.	Handigoni kuita izvozvo.
Together, we can certainly find more.	Pamwe chete, zvechokwadi tinogona kuwana zvakawanda.
You, you're still young.	Iwe, uchiri mudiki.
I know you are.	Ndinoziva kuti ndiwe.
That was good enough.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka zvakakwana.
I was lucky.	Ndakaita rombo rakanaka.

But to me, not you.	Asi kwandiri, kwete iwe.

I do not think.	handifungi .
You want to learn, all right.	Unoda kudzidza, zvakanaka.
This is my story today.	Iyi ndiyo nyaya yangu nhasi.
It's hard to be him.	Zvakaoma kuva iye.
I can tell you but one thing.	Ndinogona kukuudza asi chinhu chimwe chete.
We must do good.	Tinofanira kuita zvakanaka.
All at once.	Zvose panguva imwe chete.
He seemed happy.	Airatidza kufara.
I don’t care about it and I don’t want to know.	Ini handina basa nazvo uye handidi kuziva.
Now it is clear.	Zvino zviri pachena .
Maybe I'm the only one.	Pamwe ndini chete.
Or more care.	Kana kunyanya hanya.
He was not alone.	Akanga asiri oga zvachose.
And he wanted to be happy.	Uye aida kufara.
It is easy to say, but hard to do.	Zviri nyore kutaura, asi zvakaoma kuita.
I think it's not that hard.	Ndinofunga hazvisi zvakaoma kudaro.
Girl or something.	Musikana kana chimwe chinhu.
Not even friends.	Kwete kana shamwari.
Her husband said that it was.	Murume wake akati yakanaka kwazvo.
He could have done something of his own.	Angadai akaita chimwe chinhu zvake.
He made it easy and easy.	Akaita zvakaoma zviri nyore.
A man can.	Murume anogona.
Perfect place.	Yakakwana nzvimbo .
Big boy.	Mukomana mukuru.
In particular,.	Kunyanya, .
That is enough.	Izvozvo zvakakwana.
He was not sure why, but he did.	Akanga asina chokwadi kuti nei, asi akadaro.
That is my choice.	Ndiyo sarudzo yangu.
He was not surprised for long.	Haana kushamisika kwenguva refu.
There is absolutely no ground.	Hapana zvachose pasi.
That's a good thing.	Ndizvo zvinhu zvakanaka.
But it is not.	Asi handizvo.
He was senseless.	Aive asina musoro.
I'm worried.	Ndiri kunetseka.
I think he probably did.	Ndinofunga kuti zvimwe akadaro.
I wanted to be good.	Ndaida kuva akanaka.
I have a plan.	Ndine zano.
I know one thing.	Ndinoziva chinhu chimwe.
Or not at all.	Kana kuti kwete zvachose.
On the spot.	Ipapo, ipapo.
I see no other way.	Handisi kuona imwe nzira.
Brand new.	Itsva.
I don't find anything wrong.	Handisi kuwana chakaipa.
You can't stay.	Iwe haugone kugara.
Well, it doesn't work.	Zvakanaka, hazvisi kushanda.
That was hard to understand.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakaoma kunzwisisa.
Then you can go.	Ipapo unogona kuenda.
He did not want to be here.	Akanga asingadi kuva pano.
But there is no movement.	Asi hapana kufamba.
Very nice and easy.	Zvakanyanya kunaka uye zviri nyore.
At the same time we.	Panguva imwe chete isu.
Of course we should.	Chokwadi tinofanira.
I am happier now than I was before.	Handina kufara iye zvino kupfuura kare.
I loved.	Ndaida.
He certainly wanted one.	Chokwadi aida imwe.
But maybe you are doing something.	Asi pamwe uri kuita chimwe chinhu.
How difficult is that ?.	Zvakaoma sei izvozvo?.
And there is something else.	Uye pane chimwe chinhu.
We all know that he can do it at any time.	Isu tese tinoziva kuti anogona kuzviita chero nguva.
I would have known then.	Ndingadai ndakaziva ipapo.
But he is gone.	Asi aenda.
All good and fun.	Zvose zvakanaka uye kufara.
I must be at home.	Ndinofanira kunge ndiri kumba.
That's it .	Ndizvo .
You have to find a way with you.	Unofanira kuwana nzira newe.
He has done a lot.	Aita zvakawanda.
I had no answer to this.	Ndakashaya mhinduro pane izvi.
I did a little bit of everything.	Ndakaita zvishoma zvese.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa ipapo.
Tell the woman.	Udza mukadzi.
She always wants to have sex with him.	Anogara achida kurara naye.
A woman, not a girl.	Mukadzi, kwete musikana.
He would not have done this.	Angadai asina kuita izvi.
Or maybe it is.	Kana kuti zvimwe ndizvo.
Maybe more for you.	Zvimwe kunyanya kwauri.
It didn't come out.	Izvo hazvina kubuda.
He was a good man.	Aiva murume akanaka.
There is truth in all of this.	Pane chokwadi kune zvese izvi.
He was a good boy.	Aiva mwana akanaka.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.
He could play at any time.	Aigona kutamba chero nguva.
I can do anything without any problem.	Ndinogona kuita chero chinhu pasina dambudziko.
No one else was here.	Hapana mumwe munhu anga ari pano.
There is nothing here.	Hapana chiri pano.
But it is not.	Asi handizvo.
Not there, anyway.	Kwete ikoko, chero zvakadaro.
I made sure.	Ndakaita chokwadi.
He sat down again.	Akagara zvakare.
Any idea what is wrong.	Chero pfungwa chii chakaipa.
That's exactly what's here for me.	Ndizvo chaizvo zviri pano kwandiri.
The girl is very nice.	Musikana akanaka chaizvo.
Or do another me.	Kana kuita imwe ini.
But this is very good.	Asi izvi zvakanaka chaizvo.
But this is another time.	Asi izvi imwe nguva.
It just doesn't make sense.	Hazvina musoro chete.
I can't.	Handikwanise.
You can do anything.	Unogona kuita chero chinhu.
I have a job.	Ndine basa.
He was my husband.	Aive murume wangu.
I would have known that.	Ndingadai ndakaziva izvozvo.
But that is not true.	Asi izvozvo hazvina chokwadi.
He did not own a house.	Akanga asina imba yake.
He should have known better.	Anofanira kunge aiziva zviri nani.
Or so he thought.	Kana kuti akafunga kudaro.
He was not young.	Akanga asiri mudiki.
She is easy to go.	Ari nyore kuenda.
Or an elder.	Kana kuti mukuru.
And that is not fair.	Uye izvozvo hazvina kunaka.
No one could have done better.	Hapana aigona kuita zviri nani.
But he obviously did.	Asi zviri pachena kuti akadaro.
But you are not.	Asi iwe hausi.
He did not speak.	Haana kutaura.
I love you and me.	Ndinoda iwe neni.
No problem, though.	Hazvina dambudziko, zvakadaro.
One must accept the truth.	Munhu anofanira kubvuma chokwadi.
Those things are hard.	Zvinhu izvozvo zvakaoma.
Of course we have no choice.	Chokwadi hatina sarudzo.
And that's the point here.	Uye ndiyo pfungwa pano.
Not really, no.	Kwete chaizvo, kwete.
That's a good way to make sense.	Ndiyo nzira yakanaka yekuita pfungwa.
And it was hard, very hard.	Uye zvakanga zvakaoma, zvikuru.
Not much about luck there.	Kwete zvakawanda pamusoro rombo ipapo.
You can go back completely.	Unogona kudzokera zvachose.
But so young.	Asi mudiki kudaro.
He loves to learn.	Anoda zvikuru kudzidza.
One person.	Munhu mumwe chete.
Again, what a player.	Zvakare, chii mutambi.
Well people, here we are.	Zvakanaka vanhu, tiri pano.
But he did not.	Asi haana kudaro.
This place is not his.	Nzvimbo iyi haisi yake.
She had no children.	Akanga asina kana mwana.
Who are you.	Ani nani.
You have to stay with him.	Unofanira kugara naye.
There is a way.	Pane nzira.
I have a choice to do that.	Ndine sarudzo yekuita izvozvi.
I guess that's something.	Ndinofungidzira kuti chimwe chinhu.
But it is better than nothing.	Asi zviri nani pane chinhu.
Great man.	Murume mukuru.
He is better than that.	Ari nani pane izvozvo.
Things from the past.	Zvinhu kubva kare.
They could not come.	Havana kukwanisa kuuya.
I have another idea.	Ndine imwe pfungwa.
No worries there, either.	Hapana kunetseka ikoko, kana.
I think it's good.	Ndinofunga kuti yakanaka.
Sure talking to you.	Chokwadi kutaura newe.
But not something else.	Asi kwete chimwe chinhu.
Or looking for a job.	Kana kutsvaga basa.
You are innocent.	Iwe hauna mhosva.
But he had to try.	Asi aifanira kuedza.
He thought a little more.	Aifunga zvimwe zvishoma.
He had to eat something.	Aifanira kudya chimwe chinhu.
I have to try.	Ndinofanira kuedza.
Or he simply did not care.	Kana kuti akanga asina basa nazvo.
And again, again.	Uye zvakare, zvakare.
This is how and why.	Izvi ndizvo uye sei.
There is absolutely no power.	Hapana zvachose simba.
Easy going.	Zviri nyore.
One has to read.	Mumwe anofanira kuverenga.
Very good.	Yakanaka kwazvo.
Everything is fine.	Zvese kune zvakanaka.
History.	Zvakaitika kare.
He thought he would do well.	Akafunga kuti aizoita zvakanaka.
There, he may have a chance.	Ikoko, angave ane mukana.
But there is more to play here.	Asi pane zvakawanda zviri kutamba pano.
He can know something.	Anogona kuziva chimwe chinhu.
He didn't have to.	Aisafanira kudaro.
But it was difficult.	Asi zvakanga zvakaoma.
I did not know that it was you.	Ndaisaziva kuti ndiwe.
He didn't want that.	Aisada izvozvo.
Certainly he did not know that he was good.	Chokwadi aive asina kuziva kuti aive akanaka.
I think we can think a lot here, too.	Ndinofunga isu tinogona kufunga zvakanyanya pano, zvakare.
I do not like to do anything.	handifarire kuita chinhu.
We are moving.	Tiri kufamba.
This is not helpful.	Iyi haisi rubatsiro.
I am very happy.	Ndiri kufara zvikuru.
Or so he thought.	Kana kuti akafunga kudaro.
I think that's fine.	Ndinofunga kuti zvakanaka.
How to do this.	Nzira yekuita sei izvi.
But he was not alone.	Asi akanga asiri iye ega.
He did not sleep and did not want to eat.	Haana kurara uye haadi kudya.
He had to leave long ago.	Aifanira kubva kare kare.
That you knew.	Kuti waiziva.
I am older than you.	Ndiri mukuru kwauri.
There on the ground.	Ikoko pasi.
I want a good story.	Ndinoda nyaya yakanaka.
I'm happy here.	Ndiri kufara pano.
At this point, nothing more.	Panguva ino, hapana chimwe.
I think it's a good thing.	Ndinofunga chinhu chakanaka.
But he refused.	Asi iye akaramba.
Only he could not go.	Chete haana kukwanisa kuenda.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka chaizvo.
All good.	Zvese zvakanaka.
We know the answer to that now.	Tinoziva mhinduro kune izvozvo zvino.
Better sense.	Zviri nani pfungwa.
Or less.	Kana kuti zvishoma.
But that's what you are.	Asi ndizvo zvauri.
He kept going anyway.	Akaramba achienda zvakadaro.
I think it's good.	Ndinofunga kuti yakanaka.
Now she knows the truth.	Iye zvino ava kuziva chokwadi.
He is completely alone.	Ari oga zvachose.
That's his house.	Ndiyo imba yake.
That's the way it is.	Ndiyo nzira ipapo.
It is not that simple.	Hazvisi nyore kudaro.
You know he doesn't have this money.	Unoziva kuti haana mari iyi.
You should feel that.	Unofanira kunzwa izvozvo.
I thought it was good.	Ndaifunga kuti zvakanga zvakanaka.
She loves the baby, her baby.	Anoda mwana, mwana wake.
But it is not easy.	Asi hazvisi nyore.
Playing together.	Kutamba pamwe chete.
Great things, very great things.	Zvinhu zvikuru, zvikuru chaizvo.
Of course, this was obvious.	Chokwadi, izvi zvakanga zviri pachena.
.	.
He certainly did not feel well.	Chokwadi akanga asina kunzwa zvakanaka.
But, this is not enough.	Asi, izvi hazvisi zvakakwana.
Love you baby.	Kuda iwe mwana.
He started walking.	Akatanga kufamba.
He did just that.	Akadaro zvake .
Or maybe he was away from me.	Kana kuti pamwe aive kure neni.
Or nothing at all.	Kana kuti hapana zvachose.
This is obvious.	Izvi zviri pachena.
.	.
He didn't know why, why then.	Haana kuziva kuti sei, sei ipapo.
It's nothing.	Haisi chinhu.
I wanted to be alone.	Ndaida kuva ndega.
He did not come.	Haana kuuya.
It's much better.	Zviri nani chaizvo.
Baby you don't.	Mwana iwe kwete.
I think he thought better.	Ndofunga aifunga zviri nani.
Well, that's it.	Zvakanaka, ndizvo.
It didn't get any better.	Hazvina kuita nani.
I'm having such a good time.	Ndiri kuva nenguva yakanaka kudaro.
No one wanted to know anything.	Hapana aida kuziva chinhu.
And it was enough.	Uye zvakanga zvakakwana.
I'm going.	Ndiri kuenda.
And it is very beautiful.	Uye yakanaka kwazvo.
Especially for you.	Zvikuru kwauri.
I did with him.	Ndakaita naye.
I think we should believe.	Ndinofunga tinofanira kutenda.
He knew she was beautiful.	Aiziva kuti akanga akanaka.
Now she wants to talk.	Iye zvino anoda kutaura.
This is easy.	Izvi zviri nyore.
Such a boy.	Mukomana akadaro.
And you did not tell me.	Uye iwe hauna kundiudza.
Or less.	Kana kuti zvishoma.
Or his, but he had to do it.	Kana kuti zvake, asi aifanira kuzviita.
I want to be a good boy.	Ndinoda kuva mukomana akanaka.
What’s around.	Chii chiri pedyo.
I a little.	Ini zvishoma.
I'm a sensible person.	Ndiri munhu ane pfungwa.
But it was obvious.	Asi zvakanga zviri pachena.
That's all.	Ndizvo chete.
We have to deal with it.	Tinofanira kuita basa nazvo.
He was a good player.	Aive mutambi akanaka.
He looked like a man.	Aiita kunge murume.
Probably we are all very close to him.	Pamwe tose tiri pedyo naye zvakanyanya.
He had to talk to her.	Aifanira kutaura naye.
That alone is not good.	Izvo chete hazvina kunaka.
I'm so sorry.	Ndine urombo zvikuru.
But he was not alone.	Asi akanga asiri oga.
We didn't do it, man.	Hatina kuzviita, murume.
You better not tell anyone.	Zviri nani usina kuudza munhu.
All of this was easy to identify.	Zvose izvi zvakanga zviri nyore kuziva.
He was not sure what he would do then.	Akanga asina chokwadi kuti aizoita sei ipapo.
No one cares.	Hapana ane hanya nazvo.
Why? 	Sei?
Far from me.	Kure kwandiri.
He is the only man.	Ndiye ega murume.
Job search.	Kutsvaga basa.

I don't think he can sing.	Handifungi kuti anogona kuimba.
Good luck with it.	Rombo rakanaka nazvo.
And enjoy it.	Uye kufara nazvo.
He didn't care about it.	Akanga asina basa nazvo.
I have no answer.	Handina mhinduro.
Same thing with him, sure.	Chinhu chimwe chete naye, chokwadi.
I don't know why, but I can't do it.	Handizivi kuti sei, asi handikwanise kuzviita.
Easy going.	Zviri nyore.
It's very simple.	Zviri nyore chaizvo.
It didn't work that way at all.	Hazvina kushanda zvakadaro zvachose.
I'm not sure about that.	Handina chokwadi nazvo.
He did not give up.	Haana kurega.
I didn't care.	Handina kuita hanya nazvo.

Wonder what he was like when he was young.	Hameno kuti aive akaita sei achiri mudiki.
That's what people do.	Ndizvo zvinoita vanhu.
That's what he wanted.	Ndizvo zvaaida.
And he is definitely a good player.	Uye iye zvechokwadi mutambi akanaka.
It is often difficult to know.	Kazhinji zvakaoma kuziva.
I did not get that.	Handina kuwana zvakadaro.
Only you and me.	Iwe neni chete.
He was not alone.	Akanga asiri iye oga.
I'm still talking.	Ndichiri kutaura.
This is very difficult here.	Izvi zvakaoma chaizvo pano.

I'm leaving soon.	Ndiri kubuda nokukurumidza.
Not everyone.	Haasi munhu wese.

He did not expect to find anything.	Aive asina kutarisira kuwana chinhu.
You are very lucky.	Une rombo rakanaka.
Is he a good man?	Murume akanaka here.
Everyone really wants to be with you.	Wese munhu anoda kuva newe chaizvo.
I can do it if you don't have time.	Ndinogona kuzviita kana usina nguva.
It is easy to talk to him.	Zviri nyore kutaura naye.
No problem at all.	Hapana dambudziko zvachose.
He is still here.	Achiri pano.
I do not see.	Handisi kuona.
But you now.	Asi iwe zvino.
And he was fine.	Uye anga akanaka.
If it's a boy.	Kana ari mukomana.
He began to think of a way.	Akatanga kufunga nzira.
Maybe that was obvious.	Pamwe izvozvo zvakanga zviri pachena.
Places, people, stories and me.	Nzvimbo, vanhu, nyaya uye ini.
If he is, he is.	Kana ari iye, ndiye.
But that is not good either.	Asi izvozvo hazvina kunaka zvakare.
But he certainly was not.	Asi zvechokwadi akanga asina.
But there is more, more.	Asi pane zvakawanda, zvakawanda.
I am the only one here.	Ndini ndega pano.
He was gone.	Akanga aenda.
Now he is gone.	Iye zvino aenda.

And at the same time.	Uye panguva iyoyo.
He didn't.	Akanga asina.
If anyone was good.	Kana pane aive akanaka.
I think that is absurd.	Ndinofunga kuti hazvina musoro.
He lives there.	Anogara ikoko.
And it did.	Uye zvakaitika.
This, of course, is not true.	Izvi, zvechokwadi, hazvisi zvechokwadi.
It's true now.	Ichokwadi zvino.
No one did anything.	Hapana akaita chinhu.
I do not think.	handifungi.
I wanted to stay here forever.	Ndaida kugara pano zvachose.
Or you can stay home.	Kana kuti unogona kugara pamba.
There is something for everyone.	Pane chimwe chinhu kune wese munhu.
We need to start thinking about it.	Tinofanira kutanga kufunga nezvazvo.
He did well.	Akaita zvakanaka.

It was hard to stay.	Zvakanga zvakaoma kugara.
Everyone has a story.	Munhu wese ane nyaya.
No one can see anything.	Hapana anogona kuona chero chinhu.
It was good.	Zvakanga zvakanaka.
I wanted to do that for a long time.	Ndaida kuita izvozvo kwenguva yakareba.
Probably not.	Pamwe akanga asina.
I don't know why.	Handizivi kuti sei.
I am very happy.	Ndinofara zvikuru.
Everything else seems to be going well.	Zvimwe zvese zvinoita kunge zviri kufamba zvakanaka.
No one tried to do anything.	Hapana akaedza kuita chero chinhu.
But they did not come.	Asi havana kuuya.
Surely he would be here.	Chokwadi angadai ari pano.
She is a girl.	Ndiye musikana.
It was evening.	Akanga ari manheru.
I heard about it.	Ndakanzwa nezvazvo.
Back to another.	Kudzokera kune imwe.

I wanted to know what to do.	Ndaida kuziva zvekuita.
He looks like a doctor.	Anoita kunge chiremba.
In most cases, it is not.	Kazhinji pane, hazvina kudaro.
Or just another good one.	Kana kuti imwe yakanaka chete.
He refused to go.	Akaramba kuenda.
I'm glad he's here.	Ndinofara kuti ari pano.
And then he is not.	Uye ipapo haasi.

This is going well.	Izvi zviri kufamba zvakanaka.
It is not easy to find.	Hazvisi nyore kuwana.
And that's fine.	Uye zvakanaka.
You are still waiting anyway.	Uchiri kumirira zvakadaro.
I can't be happy.	Handigoni kufara.
Now we have to talk.	Zvino tinofanira kutaura.
I'm lying on the floor.	Ndiri kurara pasi.
He hoped he had to.	Aitarisira kuti aifanira.
But today they do not.	Asi nhasi havana.
If he does not.	Kana iye haana.
Materialism.	Kuda zvinhu.
Sing to me, not yours.	Imba yangu, kwete yako.
Or maybe not.	Kana kuti pamwe hazvisi.
I had to see.	Ndaifanira kuona.
We are convinced that it is not so.	Tine chokwadi chekuti handizvo.
It's usually not fair.	Kazhinji hazvina kunaka.
I felt very guilty.	Ndakanzwa ndine mhosva zvikuru.
But first you have to stay.	Asi kutanga unofanira kugara.
But he was definitely not there.	Asi chokwadi akanga asipo.
But seeing something completely different.	Asi kuona chimwe chinhu zvachose.
He is powerful.	Ane simba.

Of course, you have to go now.	Chokwadi, unofanira kuenda zvino.
It was very difficult to talk to her.	Zvakanga zvakaoma zvikuru kutaura naye.
Perhaps he had not read the article.	Pamwe akanga asina kuverenga nyaya yacho.
There is nothing there.	Hapana chimwe chinhu ipapo.
It didn't work, he said.	Hazvina kushanda, akadaro.
He had to do something about it.	Aifanira kuita chimwe chinhu nezvazvo.

He doesn't seem to care.	Anenge asina basa nazvo.
I can’t stop thinking about it.	Handigoni kurega kufunga nezvazvo.
He is there with you.	Ari ipapo newe.
He seemed to be alone.	Aiita kunge ari ega.
He knows he is wrong.	Anoziva kuti haana kunaka.
But he asked.	Asi akabvunza.
So far, so little.	Kusvika iye zvino, zvishoma.
There is no perfect choice.	Hapana sarudzo yakakwana.
I was down.	Ndakanga ndava pasi.
Someone is guilty or not guilty.	Mumwe ane mhosva kana kuti haana mhosva.
And what.	Uye chii.
Anyway, I am right now.	Zvakadaro, ndini izvozvi.
And we are at that moment.	Uye isu tiri panguva iyoyo.
But this is not the case.	Asi izvi hazvisi izvo.
Now that's fine.	Zvino yakanaka.
And not just him.	Uye kwete naye chete.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa ipapo.
He started walking.	Akatanga kufamba.
I'm happy with that.	Ndinofara nazvo.
We know it happened.	Tinoziva kuti zvakaitika.
I have to get out of here.	Ndinofanira kubva pano.
It was hard to say.	Zvakanga zvakaoma kutaura.
He knew she was beautiful.	Aiziva kuti akanga akanaka.
You need something from me.	Unoda chimwe chinhu kubva kwandiri.
These things are good.	Zvinhu izvi zvakanaka.
He had to be happy.	Aifanira kufara.
You can swim completely.	Unogona kushambira zvachose.
Very good choice.	Sarudzo yakanaka kwazvo.
It does not matter.	Hazvina basa zvakadaro.
It is not hard to see why he did that.	Hameno kuti nei akadaro.
He can be a better person.	Anogona kuva munhu ari nani.
It often does.	Kazhinji zvinoita.
My doctor did not help.	Chiremba wangu haana kubatsira.
But he was a man.	Asi aive munhu.
I have a lot.	Ndine zvakawanda.
He never thought about it, he said.	Haana kumbofunga nezvazvo, akadaro.
Only a boy.	Mukomana chete.
He did not want her to leave.	Akanga asingadi kuti aende.
He knows the way well.	Anoziva nzira yacho zvakanaka.
But he kept going.	Asi akaramba achienda.
But the story is still good.	Asi nyaya yakanaka zvakadaro.
He seemed happy.	Airatidza kufara.
It's hard to say right now.	Zvakaoma kutaura izvozvi.
They did not speak to me.	Havana kutaura neni.
I'm happy.	Ndinofara.
He doesn't care about me at all.	Haana basa neni zvachose.
This answer is not new.	Mhinduro iyi haisi itsva.
He doesn't have to say anything.	Haafanire kutaura chinhu.
He thinks, and man.	Anofunga, uye munhu.
There seems to be nothing wrong with it.	Zvinoita sekuti hapana chakaipa.
Well, we can do this.	Zvakanaka, tinogona kuita izvi.
He didn't have to.	Aisafanira kudaro.
But it doesn't matter now.	Asi hazvina basa manje.
But it was enough.	Asi zvakanga zvakakwana.
I had to read more about it.	Ndaifanira kuverenga zvakawanda nezvazvo.
That's not it.	Handizvo .
They are very close.	Vari pedyo zvikuru.
Something is coming to me.	Pane chimwe chinhu chiri kuuya kwandiri.
He told me so.	Akandiudza kudaro.
Not just the mind.	Kwete pfungwa chete.
Someone has to be.	Mumwe munhu anofanira kuva.

But that does not make sense.	Asi izvozvo hazvina musoro.
But I am.	Asi ndini.
Any way to do this.	Chero nzira yekuita izvi.
It's the same with me.	Ndizvo zvimwe chete neni.
Probably a little too much.	Pamwe zvishoma zvishoma.
I am doing so.	ndiri kudaro.
He was probably still asleep.	Pamwe akanga achiri akarara.
It happened so fast.	Zvakaitika nekukurumidza.
Your friend .	Shamwari yako .
I'm glad she has faith.	Ndinofara kuti ane kutenda.
He did not even want to talk to her.	Haana kana kuda kutaura naye.
I see a lot of good things here.	Ndiri kuona zvinhu zvakawanda zvakanaka pano.
That's all.	Ko zvese .
Fun together.	Kufara pamwe chete.
Often times not.	Kazhinji kazhinji kwete.
And not so good.	Uye kwete zvakanaka.
He started walking.	Akatanga kufamba.
I did not read about it.	Handina kuverenga nezvazvo.
He doesn't care.	Haana hanya.
But he didn't care.	Asi akanga asina basa nazvo.
I did not do this.	Ini handina kuita izvi.
I do not know.	Ini handizivi.
I wanted to be something, too.	Ndaida kuva chimwe chinhu, zvakare.
I have to find a car.	Ndinofanira kutsvaga motokari.
I want to get home.	Ndinoda kusvika kumba.
A good woman.	Mukadzi akanaka.
From no.	Kubva kwete.
A little better.	Zvakanaka zvishoma.
He doesn't care about it.	Haana basa nazvo.
It must be him.	Anofanira kunge ari iye.
That is powerless.	Izvozvo hazvina simba.
We have everything.	Tine zvese.
Then there is advice.	Ipapo pane zano.
But last night.	Asi nezuro manheru .
Not then we did not.	Kwete ipapo hatina kudaro.
He never thought of that.	Haana kumbofunga izvozvo.
There are issues.	Pane nyaya.
I am not a woman, friends.	Ini handisi mukadzi, shamwari.
Everyone is private.	Munhu wese ari ega.
He can't get out.	Haakwanisi kubuda.
I could not ask for more.	Handina kukwanisa kukumbira zvimwe.
I'm lucky, though.	Ndine rombo rakanaka, zvakadaro.
Today there are children.	Nhasi kune vana.
So far well,.	Kusvika zvino zvakanaka,.
Aren't they good.	Havana kunaka here.
I'm sure that's all.	Ndine chokwadi chekuti ndizvo chete.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.
But is it possible ?.	Asi zvinoita here?.
I can't wait that long.	Handisi kumirira kwenguva yakareba kudaro.
I don’t think about it too much.	Handifungi nezvazvo zvakanyanya.
It happened many times.	Zvakaitika kakawanda.
I'm fine.	Ndava zvakanaka.
I know how to dance.	Ndinoziva kutamba.
No one is alone.	Hapana ari ega.
He stayed in the house and did not go out.	Akagara mumba haana kubuda.
He doesn't know the answer now.	Haazivi mhinduro zvino.
Not true.	Kwete chokwadi.
I am a good man.	Ndiri murume akanaka.
We know that these things are true.	Tinoziva kuti zvinhu izvi ichokwadi.
Surely we can do better than that, he thought.	Chokwadi tinogona kuita zviri nani kupfuura izvi, akafunga kudaro.
He stayed with her.	Akagara naye.
But you do not want to do that.	Asi iwe hausi kuda kuita izvozvo.
Beyond that they asked for nothing.	Kupfuura izvozvo havana kukumbira chinhu.
That doesn't matter to me.	Izvo hazvina basa neni.
Now there are difficult things.	Iye zvino kune zvinhu zvakaoma.
He was not alone.	Akanga asiri oga.
He knew this.	Aiziva izvi.
But again this is your choice.	Asi zvakare iyi ndiyo sarudzo yako.
I wish that.	Ndinoshuva kuti .
He could have done it, but he wasn't going.	Aigona kudaro, asi akanga asiri kuenda.
He may not be there.	Anogona kunge asipo.
It's not fair at all.	Hazvina kunaka zvachose.
You are the one who can be.	Iwe ndiwe unogona kuva.
No, of course not.	Kwete, zvakadaro.
But he waited.	Asi akamirira.
It is not good for dogs.	Hazvina kunaka kune imbwa.
He was a good man.	Aiva munhu akanaka.
He was great.	Aive mukuru.
This is what a man does.	Izvi ndizvo zvinoita murume.
He may be telling the truth.	Anogona kunge ari kutaura chokwadi.

And he did.	Uye akadaro.
You are young.	Uri mudiki.
And maybe the police.	Uye pamwe mapurisa.
But they did not tell you that.	Asi havana kukuudza izvozvo.
I think it didn't work at all.	Ndinofunga hazvina kushanda zvachose.
It didn't come.	Hazvina kuuya.
It's not fair at all.	Hazvina kunaka zvachose.
I still feel good.	Ndichiri kunzwa zvakanaka.
He must be sleeping.	Anofanira kunge akarara.
I know enough to do it.	Ndinoziva zvakakwana kuzviita.
He did not want to hear.	Aisada kunzwa.
There is no other way.	Hapana imwe nzira.
They are looking for someone.	Vari kutsvaga mumwe munhu.
It doesn't matter at all and it's not good.	Hazvina basa zvachose uye hazvina kunaka.
He was very young.	Aive mudiki zvake .
He must know better, he must really.	Anofanira kuziva zviri nani, anofanira chaizvo.
We are now, one to the other.	Isu tiri iye zvino, mumwe kune mumwe.
He was a good player.	Aive mutambi akanaka.
Maybe he didn't want her around.	Pamwe aisada kuti ave pedyo.
She is still young.	Achiri mudiki.
It's up to me.	Zviri kwandiri.
Good teacher.	Mudzidzisi akanaka.
Apparently he was not feeling well.	Zviri pachena kuti akanga asiri kunzwa zvakanaka.
But then again.	Asi zvakare.
And that's fine too.	Uye izvozvo zvakanaka zvakare.
He was not the only one in prison.	Haasi oga akanga ari mujeri.
He had to go.	Aifanira kuenda.
But you must find the truth.	Asi unofanira kuwana chokwadi.
He knew how to dance.	Aiziva kutamba.
I'm glad you are not.	Ndinofara kuti hausi.
This is my answer.	Iyi ndiyo mhinduro yangu.
Well, well, very good.	Zvakanaka, zvakanaka, zvakanaka kwazvo.
It is very easy to understand why.	Zviri nyore kwazvo kunzwisisa kuti sei.
He had no other wife.	Akanga asina mumwe mukadzi.
Not immediately.	Kwete nekukurumidza.
This is not good for you.	Izvi hazvina kunaka kwauri.
He may not really care about her at all.	Zvimwe angave asina hanya naye zvachose.
But that is not exactly the case.	Asi izvo hazvisi izvo chaizvo.
This is all.	Izvi ndizvo zvose.
Eating is for sure.	Kudya pane chokwadi.
And they are.	Uye vari.
I have my place.	Ndine nzvimbo yangu.
They are not guilty.	Havana kana mhosva.
He was younger than me too.	Aive mudiki kwandiri zvakare.
In that case.	Kana zvakadaro.
I have my time too.	Ndine nguva yangu zvakare.
He was not thinking right.	Akanga asiri kufunga zvakanaka.
Or you may be lucky.	Kana kuti unogona kuita rombo rakanaka.
He never thought about it.	Akanga asina kumbofunga nezvazvo.
Everything is complicated.	Zvinhu zvose zvakaoma.
We have to do this.	Tinofanira kuita izvi.
Well, better than that, really.	Zvakanaka, zviri nani pane izvozvo, chaizvo.
Of course, that's easy.	Chokwadi, kuti nyore.
He loves this house.	Anoda imba iyi.
We are doing it again.	Tiri kuzviita zvakare.
He should not have worried about that.	Aifanira kunge asina kunetseka nazvo.
He heard something.	Akanzwa chimwe chinhu.
You do not have to go back there.	Haufanire kudzokera ikoko.
I did well on this.	Ndakaita zvakanaka pane izvi.
Asking for a problem.	Kukumbira dambudziko.
But the answer is also simple.	Asi mhinduro yacho zvakare iri nyore.
He does not know.	Haazivi.
And that's it.	Uye ndizvo.
Maybe we should try something.	Zvimwe tinofanira kuedza chimwe chinhu.
Nobody cares about it.	Hapana ane basa nazvo.
He acts thoughtlessly.	Anoita asina kufunga.
But he.	Asi iye .
Again it didn't work.	Zvakare hazvina kufamba.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
But now it happened.	Asi zvino zvakaitika.
Not for everyone.	Kwete kune vese.
Then he went downstairs.	Akabva aenda pasi.
He doesn't care about it.	Haana basa nazvo.
We are all.	Tese tiri .
Aida mota.	Aida mota.
I have a good reason, though.	Ndine chikonzero chakanaka, zvakadaro.
I knew a better way.	Ndaiziva imwe nzira iri nani.
I do not understand why.	Handisi kunzwisisa kuti sei.
But now we have to think about it.	Asi zvino tinofanira kufunga nezvazvo.
And consider doing it again.	Uye kufunga kuzviita zvakare.
We are alone.	Tiri chete.
I know, he's good.	Ndinoziva, akanaka.
Not so much, but a little bit.	Kwete zvakanyanya, asi zvishoma.
Now you can eat something.	Iye zvino unogona kudya chimwe chinhu.
Everyone is always innocent.	Munhu wese anogara asina mhosva.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Aigona kuita chero zvaaida.
A letter .	Tsamba .
He heard something.	Akanzwa chimwe chinhu.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka chaizvo.
I'm learning to be comfortable with it.	Ndiri kudzidza kuva zvakanaka nazvo.
He didn't have to.	Aisafanira kudaro.
He sat down.	Akagara pasi.
That place.	Nzvimbo iyoyo.
And he should know.	Uye anofanira kuziva.
But then he didn't care.	Asi ipapo akanga asina basa nazvo.
You need to know.	Unofanira kuziva.
But still that is not the case.	Asi zvakadaro hazvina kudaro.
I'm still thinking.	Ndichiri kufunga.
I obviously do not want to do this.	Ini pachena handidi kuita izvi.
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!	Kutaura nezvazvo, tinofanira kuenda.
He had to find another place.	Aifanira kutsvaga imwe nzvimbo.
He didn't seem to care.	Aiita seasina basa nazvo.
At least, to tell you the truth.	Zvishoma, kukuudza chokwadi.
But we can do it.	Asi tinogona kuzviita.
We have no time for that.	Hatina nguva nazvo.
He was closer to you than anyone else.	Aive pedyo newe kupfuura chero ani zvake.
He said he wasn't.	Akati akanga asiri.

And then the police.	Uye ipapo mapurisa.
But there is no answer.	Asi hapana mhinduro.
Or someone else.	Kana mumwe munhu.
Or he more.	Kana iye zvimwe.
Not really to begin with.	Kwete chaizvo kutanga.
You know, play together.	Iwe unoziva, kutamba pamwe chete.
But I could not.	Asi handina kukwanisa.
They don't care about it.	Havana basa nazvo.
I am not a fool.	Handisi munhu asina musoro.
He did not think that he wanted to go home.	Haana kufunga kuti aida kuenda kumba.
He seemed absent.	Aiita kunge asipo.

This is not fair.	Izvi hazvina kunaka.
He can read anyone.	Anogona kuverenga chero munhu.
I knew something.	Ndakaziva chimwe chinhu.
Today, things are better.	Nhasi, zvinhu zviri nani.
It doesn't make sense.	Haisi pfungwa.
Good to see.	Zvakanaka kuona.

He had to accept that.	Aifanira kubvuma izvozvo.

She is doing well.	Ari kuita zvakanaka.
Again, long hair long long long long.	Zvakare, refu refu refu refu refu refu.
He always is.	Anogara akadaro.
I didn't want to be her friend.	Ndaisada kuva shamwari yake.
It is better to stay indoors today.	Zviri nani kugara mumba nhasi.
So at the same time.	Zvakadaro nguva imwe chete.
For a long time.	Kwenguva refu.
I had no time for it.	Ndakanga ndisina nguva nazvo.
He refused to talk at all.	Akaramba zvachose kutaura.
Still, it did not help much.	Zvakadaro, hazvina kubatsira zvakanyanya.
I can't play boy.	Handikwanisi kutamba mukomana.
Well then.	Zvakanaka ipapo.
I want to be able to do anything.	Ndinoda kukwanisa kuita chero chinhu.
He lives with me.	Anogara neni.
He does not want to take me home.	Haadi kuenda neni kumba.
Please, he said.	Ndapota, akadaro.
This is very difficult.	Izvi zvakaoma chaizvo.
We need to have time.	Tinofanira kuva nenguva.
I want to know.	Ndave kuda kuziva.
Not to say too much.	Kwete kutaura zvakawanda.
It's you and me.	Ndiwe neni.
Not that this happened to me.	Kwete kuti izvi zvakaitika kwandiri.
This is completely absurd.	Izvi hazvina musoro zvachose.
But then he heard something.	Asi zvino akanzwa chimwe chinhu.
No one should be able to do that.	Hapana anofanira kukwanisa kuita izvozvo.
And he was better.	Uye akanga ari nani.
Happy to do work.	Kufara kuita basa.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.
He knew he had to do something.	Aiziva kuti aifanira kuita chimwe chinhu.

But he refused.	Asi akaramba.
But he didn't care.	Asi akanga asina basa nazvo.

Well he wasn't.	Zvakanaka akanga asiri.
Tomorrow the police would have arrived.	Mangwana mapurisa angadai asvika.
Of course everything is here.	Zvechokwadi zvose zviri pano.
This is not an option.	Iyi haisi sarudzo.
But to be honest it doesn't matter.	Asi kutaura chokwadi hazvina basa.
I am still looking for a job.	Ndichiri kutsvaga basa.
He wanted to be with her.	Aida kuva naye.
It's not stuff.	Hazvisi zvinhu.
That, of course, is not true.	Izvozvo, zvechokwadi hazvisi zvechokwadi.

There are a few exceptions.	Pane zvishoma zvishoma.

Or do something good without anyone knowing.	Kana kuita chinhu chakanaka pasina anoziva.
Of course he was not.	Chokwadi akanga asipo.

He was in the house.	Aive mumba.
I'm still thinking that.	Ndichiri kufunga izvozvo.

But no one really cared about me.	Asi hapana kana akaita hanya neni.
You have to wonder what is going on.	Unofanira kushamisika kuti chii chiri kuitika.
It's hard to know.	Zvakaoma kuziva.
This was good.	Izvi zvakanga zvakanaka.
She loves a man.	Anoda murume.
This time it's really happening.	Nguva ino zviri kuitika chaizvo.
I know this is absurd.	Ndinoziva kuti izvi hazvina musoro.
He had a lot of time.	Akanga ane nguva yakawanda.
That's all.	Izvo chete.
I don't know when.	Handizivi kuti rinhi.

She needs to know where her baby is.	Anofanira kuziva pane mwana wake.
It didn't start well.	Hazvina kutanga zvakanaka.
You are not really here.	Hausi pano chaizvo.
I could see why he wanted to do that.	Ndakaona kuti sei aida kudaro.

No one, no guilt.	Hapana munhu, hapana mhosva.

And we can do it better.	Uye tinogona kuzviita zviri nani.
I haven't played in a while.	Ndave nenguva ndisina kutamba.
He is here with me.	Ari pano neni.
Probably no one can.	Pamwe hapana anogona kuita.
He thinks he knows.	Anofunga kuti anoziva.
Then he thought of something else.	Zvino akafunga chimwe chinhu.
And that happened many times.	Uye izvozvo zvakaitika kakawanda.
He didn't, but he could.	Haana kudaro, asi aigona kudaro.
He can try harder than that.	Anogona kuedza zvakanyanya kupfuura izvozvo.
They have no time.	Havana nguva.
Or, he tried.	Kana kuti, akaedza.
But it did not work for long.	Asi hazvina kushanda kwenguva refu.

Once upon a time.	Pane imwe nguva.
He then did a little bit.	Akabva aita zvishoma.
He knew he didn't want to.	Akaziva kuti aisada.
Or us.	Kana isu .

There is a time here.	Pane nguva pano.
But you really need to do something.	Asi iwe zvechokwadi unoda kuita chimwe chinhu.
Not to reach, well, for a long time.	Kwete kusvika, zvakanaka, kwenguva yakareba.
That's a lot of time.	Ndiyo nguva yakawanda.
I hope someone can help.	Ndinovimba mumwe anogona kubatsira.
If nothing better.	Kana pasina chiri nani.
This is exactly what he wanted.	Izvi ndizvo zvaaida chaizvo.
We have no choice.	Hatina sarudzo.
This was good in the past.	Izvi zvakanga zvakanaka kare.

And he didn't.	Uye akanga asina.
They're all the same thing.	Vose chinhu chimwe.
And good too.	Uye zvakanaka zvakare.
But he refused to admit his guilt.	Asi akaramba kubvuma kuti ndiye ane mhosva.
We have to move.	Tinofanira kufamba.
I did not do well.	Handina kuita zvakanaka.
He slept well.	Akarara zvakanaka.
This is what is happening.	Izvi ndizvo zviri kuitika.
He has no power.	Haana simba.

You can read more about it here.	Unogona kuverenga zvakawanda nezvazvo pano.
No one on earth knows more than you do.	Hapana munhu pasi pano anoziva kupfuura iwe.
He was and is a human being.	Akanga ari uye ari munhu.
But he had to be surprised.	Asi aifanira kushamisika.
Travel is not a crime.	Kufamba haisi mhosva.
That’s all and at the same time nothing.	Ndizvo zvose uye panguva imwe chete hapana.

This is working fine.	Izvi zviri kushanda zvakanaka.
He didn't care about it.	Akanga asina basa nazvo.
It happens often.	Zvinoita kakawanda.
You know it's not going well.	Unoziva kuti hazvisi kufamba zvakanaka.

There is nothing wrong with that, he said.	Hapana chakaipa ipapo, akadaro.
He really went.	Akaenda chaizvo.
That's hard.	Ndizvo zvakaoma.
But, absolutely this is not mine.	Asi, zvachose iyi haisi yangu.
And no one knew anyone.	Uye hapana aiziva munhu.
You need advice.	Unoda zano.
Here we have one.	Pano tine imwe.
She was a girl.	Ndiye aive musikana.
I thought it was absurd.	Ndakafunga kuti hazvina musoro.
Then you have me.	Ipapo iwe une ini.

You should enjoy it.	Unofanira kufara nazvo.

He knew he was human.	Aiziva kuti aive munhu.
One elder said that.	Mumwe mukuru akadaro kuti.

Not much is going on outside.	Hapana zvakawanda zviri kuitika kunze.
But neither do we.	Asi nesu hazvisi kana.
This did not happen.	Izvi hazvina kuitika.

But often it did not.	Asi kazhinji hazvina kuita zvakadaro.
We could not do it today.	Hatina kukwanisa kuzviita nhasi.
I want to sleep.	Ndinoda kurara.
Her husband has not yet arrived home.	Murume wake haasati asvika kumba.
I think that's all.	Ndinofunga kuti zvose.
There is no better choice.	Hapana sarudzo yakanaka.
That's the time.	Ndiyo nguva yacho.
He was not sure who he was.	Akanga asina chokwadi chokuti aiva ani.
That's a simple idea.	Ndiyo pfungwa iri nyore.
But he did not.	Asi haana.
I can't tell you.	Handikwanise kukuudza.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.
And that's the same thing here.	Uye ndizvo zvimwe chete pano.

Someone gave this job.	Mumwe munhu akapa basa iri.
He was a skeptic.	Aive munhu asina chokwadi.
He tried really hard.	Akaedza chaizvo.
We are very lucky.	Tine rombo rakanaka.
He was a great man then.	Aive murume mukuru ipapo.

He did not sleep.	Haana kurara.
You don't have to say it's okay.	Haufanire kutaura kuti zvakanaka.
But first, of course.	Asi kutanga, chokwadi.
But no one else knows.	Asi hapana mumwe anoziva.
More than a few things.	Kupfuura zvinhu zvishoma.
There is no easy answer.	Hapana mhinduro iri nyore.
You have no sense.	Hauna musoro.
I have no idea about it.	Handina pfungwa nazvo.
It is difficult to say what is happening.	Zvakaoma kutaura zviri kuitika.
I guess that.	Ndinofungidzira izvozvo.
He is doing something.	Ari kuita chimwe chinhu.
And no sooner.	Uye hapana nekukurumidza.
Nice house, good man.	Imba yakanaka, murume akanaka.
But that is easy.	Asi izvozvo zviri nyore.

It's not your fault.	Haisi mhosva yako.
It happened again.	Zvakaitika zvakare.
Not a man.	Kwete murume.
I hope this works.	Ndinovimba izvi zvinoita.
And we now know why.	Uye isu zvino tinoziva chikonzero nei.
He certainly had no chance.	Chokwadi aive asina mukana.
She agreed to his request.	Akabvuma zvaaida.
But I did not get an answer.	Asi handina kuwana mhinduro.
But he did not say.	Asi haana kutaura.

He thought about the matter on his way home.	Akafunga nyaya iyi achienda kumba.
And you are mine.	Uye uri wangu.
But he didn't get any time.	Asi haana kuwana chero nguva.
He said he could do it.	Akati anogona kudaro.
But, you can be.	Asi, unogona kunge uri.
This is absurd, to say the least.	Izvi hazvina musoro, kutaura zvishoma.
Everybody else.	Munhu wese zvake.
It's going well.	Zviri kufamba zvakanaka.
He should not have told you.	Aifanira kunge asina kukuudza.
It is not easy.	Hazvina nyore kupfuura izvozvo.
He could not say why, but he did.	Haana kukwanisa kutaura kuti sei, asi akadaro.
I'm wondering one thing.	Ndiri kushamisika chinhu chimwe.
Food and what.	Chikafu uye chii.
Often every night.	Kakawanda manheru ega ega.
And he got this.	Uye akawana izvi.

Then again, he doesn't have to.	Ipapo zvakare, haafanire kudaro.

Not so.	Hazvina kudaro.
That's hard.	Ndizvo zvakaoma.
It has to be me.	Ndinofanira kunge ndiri ini.
You can work here.	Unogona kushanda pano.
He could do it today if he wanted to.	Aigona kuzviita nhasi kana achida.
He seemed uncertain.	Akaita seasina chokwadi.

And that's a good answer too.	Uye ndiyo mhinduro yakanaka zvakare.
In fact, he has no time.	Kutaura chokwadi, haana nguva.

But he's a boy.	Asi iye mukomana.

There is a long wait.	Pane kumirira kwenguva refu.

And there is ample time.	Uye pane nguva yakakwana.
He does not know when that will be, but he knows it will happen.	Haazivi kuti rinhi, asi anoziva kuti zvichaitika.
Long before he arrived he was asleep.	Nguva refu asati asvika akarara.
It's not either.	Hazvisi kana.

He did not know the car.	Haana kuziva mota.
He is to me.	Ndiye kwandiri.
I don’t want that on anyone or me either.	Handidi izvozvo pane ani zvake kana ini zvakare.
I don't want to hurry.	Ini handidi nekukurumidza.

They are not very good.	Havana kunyanya kunaka.
Want to talk.	Kuda kutaura.
If you are guilty.	Kana iwe mhosva.
He did just that.	Akadaro zvake.
I do not want his money.	Handidi mari yake.
I hope someone can help here.	Ndinovimba mumwe munhu anogona kubatsira pano.

This is very simple.	Izvi chaizvo zviri nyore.
But he had to go back, he had no choice yet.	Asi aifanira kudzokera, akanga asina sarudzo zvakadaro.
It is completely incomprehensible.	Hazvina zvachose kunzwisisa.
What's wrong.	Chii chakaipa.
But again that is not the case.	Asi zvakare hazvina kudaro.
He should get home as soon as possible.	Anofanira kunge asvika kumba nekukurumidza.

And yet he did not come.	Uye zvakadaro haana kuuya.

He seemed to be like that.	Aiita kunge akadaro.
Or maybe me.	Kana kuti zvimwe ini.

Everyone must make their own choice.	Munhu wese anofanira kuita sarudzo yake.
I would have known.	Ndingadai ndakaziva.
Not at all.	Kwete zvachose.
We could not find any more.	Hatina kukwanisa kuwana zvimwe.
I did not wait long.	Handina kumirira nguva refu.

Or plan to buy one.	Kana kuronga kutenga imwe.
I like this.	Ndinoda izvi.
You may know.	Unogona kuziva.
We know a lot.	Tinoziva zvakawanda.
There is another reason why he still believes.	Pane chimwe chikonzero nei achiri kutenda.
During the day, less or less.	Masikati, zvishoma kana zvishoma.
There is something like that.	Pane zvimwe zvakadaro.
He knows what it is.	Anoziva kuti chii.
The place is so beautiful.	Nzvimbo yacho yakanaka kwazvo.
And if so, that's fine with you.	Uye kana zvakadaro, zvakanaka kwauri.
You can't tell this to anyone.	Iwe haugone kuudza izvi kuna ani zvake.
I don't want to think about it.	Handidi kufunga nezvazvo.

If he said he was with her, she was with him.	Kana akati aiva naye, aiva naye.
Good job, baby.	Basa rakanaka, mwana.
Well, he said.	Zvakanaka, akadaro.
But there is another.	Asi pane imwe.
And there is only one way to do it.	Uye pane nzira imwe chete yekuita izvozvo.

None of his guilt.	Hapana kana mhosva yake.

He brought it himself.	Akauya nazvo ega.
Enough to think.	Zvakakwana kufunga.
She's really good.	Akanaka zvechokwadi.
It makes no sense to you.	Hazvina musoro kwauri.
You are my teacher.	Ndiwe mudzidzisi wangu.
He would have known the police.	Angadai akaziva mapurisa.
There is no other way to that.	Hapana imwe nzira kune izvozvo.

Or you, obviously.	Kana iwe, zviri pachena.

He has that.	Ane izvozvo.
He just knows it happened.	Anoziva chete kuti zvakaitika.
He did not have any of his own.	Akanga asina kana yake.
There is no answer.	Hapana mhinduro.
If so, he was very good.	Kana zvakadaro, aive akanaka kwazvo.
He was a great boy.	Aive mukomana mukuru.
I am more than you, he said.	Ini kupfuura iwe, akadaro.

Obviously it was good.	Zviri pachena kuti zvakanga zvakanaka.
No, it does not.	Kwete, hazvisi kuitika.
Not that he never tried to be happy.	Kwete kuti haana kuedza kufara.
I do not see this.	Handisi kuona izvi.
Not tonight, though.	Kwete manheru ano, zvakadaro.
And you are very lucky.	Uye une rombo rakanaka.

You don't have to say things like that.	Haufanire kutaura zvinhu zvakadaro.
And he is still doing it now.	Uye achiri kuzviita iye zvino.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.
But that is not the case.	Asi hazvina kudaro.
I did not wait to find out.	Handina kumirira kuziva.
Well, he didn't.	Zvakanaka, akanga asina.
I don't care.	Handina hanya.
It does not pass.	Haisi kupfuura.
I'm sure he didn't sleep well.	Ndine chokwadi chekuti haana kurara zvakanaka.
This, of course, would be me.	Izvi, zvechokwadi, ndingadai ndiri ini.
But that is not the case.	Asi hazvina kudaro.
No sleeping here.	Hapana kurara pano.
He will be very good.	Achange akanaka chaizvo.
Of course a little more.	Chokwadi zvimwe zvishoma .
These people are easy to find.	Vanhu ava vari nyore kuwana.
But not often.	Asi kwete kazhinji.
They are doing well.	Vari kuita zvakanaka.
There is something like that.	Pane zvimwe zvakadaro.
There is plenty of room.	Pane nzvimbo yakawanda.
He did not come to me.	Haana kuuya kwandiri.
And the house.	Uye imba.
If not.	Kana kwete.
Especially so, really.	Kunyanya zvakadaro, chaizvo.
I saw his place.	Ndakaona nzvimbo yake.
Everyone says they look like their own people.	Munhu wese anoti anoita kunge vanhu vake.
He said well, well.	Akati zvakanaka, zvakanaka.
He does not want my money.	Haadi mari yangu.
I want to try to do it myself.	Ndinoda kuedza kuzviita ini.
Man always wants more.	Munhu anogara achida zvakawanda.
Not until last week, though.	Kwete kusvika svondo rapfuura, zvakadaro.

I'm here every night.	Ndiri pano manheru ega ega.
But he thought he was good.	Asi aifunga kuti akanga akanaka.
But that is a choice.	Asi ndiyo sarudzo.
But that is the point.	Asi ndiyo nyaya yacho.
Power, man, easy.	Simba, murume, nyore.
He said he was not alone.	Akati akanga asiri iye ega.
I do not want to talk to him.	Handidi kutaura naye.

You did not.	Hauna kudaro.
That's just what's happening right now.	Ndizvo chete zviri kuitika izvozvi.
He is near now.	Ava pedyo zvino.
He felt his way.	Akanzwa nzira yake.
Well, maybe a little.	Zvakanaka, pamwe zvishoma.
You have no power here.	Hauna simba pano.
It's a lot harder.	Zvakaoma zvakaoma.
Maybe he has another girlfriend.	Pamwe ane mumwe musikana.
Simple but true.	Nyore asi chokwadi.
I had no answer.	Ndakashaya mhinduro.
Now you can go.	Iye zvino unogona kuenda.
There is so much to do and no one cares.	Pane zvakawanda zvekuita uye hapana anotarisira.
A little, now.	Zvishoma, zvino.
Without work.	Pasina basa .
Maybe it was simple enough.	Pamwe zvakanga zviri nyore zvakakwana.
There is no guilt.	Hapana kana mhosva.
They are playing together.	Vari kutamba pamwe chete.
Probably a doctor like that.	Pamwe chiremba akadaro.
I didn't like that story.	Ndaisada nyaya iyoyo.
To be honest he was my man at work.	Kutaura chokwadi ndiye aiva munhu wangu kubasa.
It's not your fault.	Haisi mhosva yako.
It is better to sleep.	Zviri nani kurara.
Generally, it is true.	Kazhinji, ichokwadi.
You have to do it.	Unofanira kuita.
I am very happy to be here.	Ndinofara zvikuru kuva pano.
Or maybe, it's not.	Kana kuti pamwe, handizvo.
I'm going out right now.	Ndiri kubuda izvozvi.
Very nice boy.	Mukomana akanaka chaizvo.
I couldn’t stop quickly enough.	Handina kukwanisa kurega nokukurumidza zvakakwana.
This is working.	Izvi zviri kushanda.
He had no money.	Akanga asina mari.
He did not get an answer.	Haana kuwana mhinduro.
He could have done it, but he wasn't.	Aigona kudaro, asi akanga asiri.
He is always near us.	Anogara ari pedyo nesu.
No offense, no.	Hapana mhosva, kwete.
It's taking a bit, though.	Zviri kutora zvishoma, zvakadaro.
But he could not do that.	Asi haana kukwanisa kuzviita.
We are all doing well here at home.	Tese tiri kuita zvakanaka pano pamba.
But of course.	Asi chokwadi.

Here they are, he thought.	Vari pano, akafunga kudaro.
You are the only one who knows.	Iwe ndiwe chete unoziva.
He was not alone.	Akanga asiri iye ega.
To anyone.	Kuna ani zvake.
They all have nothing.	Vese havana chinhu.
I love all of that.	Ndinoda zvose zvakadaro.
You know you want to.	Unoziva kuti unoda.
So far.	Kure, kure.
One has to make a choice.	Munhu anofanira kuita sarudzo.
He was hoping to get some help from someone.	Aitarisira kuwana rubatsiro kubva kune mumwe munhu.
I have a lot.	Ndine zvakawanda.
This is not one.	Iyi haisi imwe.
I'm not even playing.	Handisi kana kutamba.
He is the power.	Ndiye simba.
You can be alone.	Unogona kuva chete.
He had to do something.	Aifanira kuita chimwe chinhu.
I had no problem with that.	Handina kuita dambudziko nazvo.
There is power.	Pane simba.
I really like this place.	Ini ndinoda chaizvo nzvimbo ino.
Doctor! ' 	Chiremba!'
But he refused.	Asi akaramba.
I think he is a man.	Ndinofunga kuti murume.
And that's fine.	Uye zvakanaka.
That does not make sense.	Izvozvo hazvina musoro.
The truth is easy to understand.	Chokwadi chiri nyore kunzwisisa.
Well, enough.	Zvakanaka, zvakakwana.
I may not have children.	Ndinogona kunge ndisina vana.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
It happened so quickly to me.	Zvakaitika nokukurumidza chaizvo kwandiri.
Probably very good.	Pamwe yakanaka kwazvo.
I need friends, companions,.	Ndinoda shamwari, shamwari, .
I'm a little sorry.	Ndine urombo zvishoma.
No, it is not.	Kwete, hazvina kudaro.
I loved this car.	Ndaida mota iyi.
I have to say.	Ndinofanira kutaura.
He has made his choice.	Aita sarudzo yake.
Good and good.	Zvakanaka uye zvakanaka.
Everyone has one.	Munhu wese ane imwe.
He wanted to help people.	Aida kubatsira vanhu.
There is no need for you to do this work.	Hapana chikonzero chekuti uite basa iri.
I am the only one.	Ndini chete.
Of course you can have it all.	Chokwadi unogona kuva nazvo zvose.
But what a good thing.	Asi chii chakanaka.
There is not enough space.	Hapana nzvimbo yakakwana.
No one seemed to be getting close.	Hapana airatidza kuva pedyo.
I wanted that most of all.	Ndaida izvozvo kupfuura zvose.
But not for long.	Asi kwete kwenguva refu.
And that's fine.	Uye zvakanaka.
There is not one thing.	Hapana chinhu chimwe chete.
I know he's here, somewhere.	Ndinoziva kuti ari pano, pane imwe nzvimbo.
Wonder if that is true.	Hameno kuti ichokwadi here.
Everything will happen.	Zvose zvichaitika.
Nice place, nice.	Nzvimbo yakanaka, yakanaka.
And far away.	Uye kure kure.
This is obviously wrong.	Izvi zviri pachena kuti hazvina kunaka.
It wasn't him.	Akanga asiri iye.
He's not sure, though.	Haana chokwadi, zvakadaro.
Why the other girl didn't.	Sei mumwe musikana akanga asina.
Not this morning.	Kwete mangwanani ano.
We need to know what it is.	Tinofanira kuziva kuti chii.
Well, he did just that.	Zvakanaka, akaita izvozvo chaizvo.
My husband knows.	Murume wangu anoziva.
First you can talk about it.	Kutanga iwe unogona kutaura nezvazvo.

He had to learn this.	Aifanira kudzidza izvi.
This is happening now.	Izvi zviri kuitika zvino.
I have to help.	Ndinofanira kubatsira.
There is nothing good or bad.	Hapana chakanaka kana chakaipa.
You are too young to have children.	Uchiri mudiki kuita vana.
Not just here.	Kwete pano chete.
But he kept waiting.	Asi akaramba akamirira.
I have no problem doing that.	Handina dambudziko kuita izvozvo.
This is all good.	Izvi zvese zvakanaka.
But it happened quickly.	Asi zvakaitika nekukurumidza.
They are all doing very well.	Vose vari kuita zvakanaka zvikuru.
How does he know.	Anoziva sei.
To me, too.	Kwandiri, zvakare.
I find that difficult.	Ndiri kuona kuti zvakaoma.
And one time he was at work.	Uye pane imwe nguva akanga ari kubasa.
This is exactly what happened.	Izvi ndizvo chaizvo zvakaitika.
But no one else does.	Asi hapana mumwe anoita.
He had no way, for no reason.	Akanga asina nzira, pasina chikonzero.
You know what exactly is at this very moment.	Iwe unoziva izvo chaizvo zviri panguva ino chaizvo.
It is not coming.	Haisi kuuya.

He did not expect to stay long.	Akanga asina kutarisira kugara kwenguva refu.
But here you have to be.	Asi pano unofanira kuva.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Haadi kutaura nezvazvo.
At that point, you have no choice.	Panguva iyoyo, iwe hauna sarudzo.
And he, too.	Uye iye, zvakare.
No one wants to tell the truth.	Hapana anoda kutaura chokwadi.
You have no lion.	Hauna simba.
You have to go.	Unofanira kuenda.
If he felt the need.	Kana akanzwa achida.
He doesn't care about it.	Haana basa nazvo.
We have to try.	Tinofanira kuedza.
You have no one.	Iwe hauna munhu.
She is so beautiful.	Akanaka kudaro.
It looks good.	Zvinoita kunge zvakanaka.
No worries, friends.	Hapana kunetseka, shamwari.
It's not his.	Hazvisi zvake.
I wish you hadn’t done it.	Ndinoshuva kuti dai usina kuzviita.
What happened now will happen now.	Zvakaitika zvino zvichaitika zvino.
But the girl did not pay attention to him.	Asi musikana haana kuita hanya naye.
Not exactly that.	Kwete izvozvo chaizvo.
I can do nothing, or read.	Handigoni kuita chinhu, kana kuverenga.
All or nothing.	Zvese kana hapana.
But you are coming with me.	Asi uri kuuya neni.

There is no book.	Hapana bhuku.
Tese tine.	Tese tine .
What a horrible thing.	Chinhu chakaipa sei.
There is an opportunity here.	Pane mukana pano.
Finding a good wife.	Kutsvaga mukadzi akanaka.
I never thought about it.	Handina kumbofunga nezvazvo.
He doesn't need any advice on this.	Haadi chero zano pane izvi.
I have a reason.	Ndine chikonzero.
He had to stay away, he knew.	Aifanira kugara kure, aiziva.
I knew the power.	Ndakaziva simba racho.
I have to know the truth.	Ndinofanira kuziva chokwadi.
Good idea.	Pfungwa yakanaka.
I can't say much.	Handikwanisi kutaura zvakanyanya.
That's your only way.	Ndiyo nzira yako chete.
That's great.	Ndizvo zvikuru.
And he is gone.	Zvino aenda.
There is no answer.	Hapana mhinduro.
He said.	Ndiye akadaro.
That does not make sense.	Izvozvo hazvina musoro.
Not so here.	Hazvina kudaro pano.
I really wanted to.	Ndaida chaizvo.
He can go.	Anogona kuenda.
He did everything right.	Akaita zvose zvakanaka.
But it is not happening tomorrow.	Asi hazvisi kuitika mangwana.
We know the story.	Tinoziva nyaya yacho.
No wonder.	Pasina kushamisika zvakanyanya.
He has done this.	Aita izvi.
And everybody was down, everybody knew who they were.	Uye munhu wese aive pasi, munhu wese aiziva kuti aive ani.
He’s such a player.	Ndiye mutambi akadaro.
I can't help it this time.	Handigoni kubatsira nguva ino.
Why no one knows.	Sei pasina anoziva.
I think he should.	Ndinofunga anofanira.
I don't know that we should.	Handizivi kuti tinofanira kudaro.
I have a dog.	Ndine imbwa.
This is a beautiful house.	Iyi imba yakanaka.
We really have.	Tine chaizvo.
All well and good.	Zvose zvakanaka uye zvakanaka.
I can't figure out the problem.	Ini handisi kukwanisa kuziva dambudziko.
But he is not talking.	Asi haasi kutaura.
I had nothing to do or believe.	Ndakashaya zvekuita kana kutenda.
Now he knows this.	Iye zvino anoziva izvi.
Or more stressful.	Kana kunyanya kunetseka.
And we don't care about that.	Uye isu hatina basa nazvo.
But one.	Asi imwe chete.
There is no way at all.	Hapana nzira zvachose.
Handsome boy.	Mukomana akanaka.
But it was easy to stay.	Asi zvakanga zviri nyore kugara.
Very simple.	Zvakanyanya nyore.
Probably not.	Pamwe hazvina kudaro.
But that's my only way.	Asi ndiyo nzira yangu chete.
Of course, there is no money.	Chokwadi, hapana mari.
But things did not work out that way.	Asi zvinhu hazvina kushanda ipapo.
We can see that.	Tinogona kuona izvozvi.
I guess he doesn't.	Ndinofungidzira kuti haana.
That's one way.	Ndiyo imwe nzira.
It was harder than that.	Zvakanga zvakaoma kupfuura izvozvo.
He first got here.	Akatanga kusvika pano.
I am eating well.	Ndiri kudya zvakanaka.
His goodness.	Zvakanaka zvake.
And that is the point.	Uye ndiyo pfungwa.
I have to do something.	Ndinofanira kuita chimwe chinhu.
But, there is something.	Asi, pane chimwe chinhu.
He did not want this.	Aisada izvi.
But and often you know.	Asi uye kazhinji unoziva.
Now is the only time.	Iye zvino ndiyo nguva chete.
But the reason.	Asi chikonzero.
Too much to take.	Zvakanyanya kutora.
Nobody wants to play with us.	Hapana anoda kutamba nesu.
I hope one, too.	Ndinovimba imwe chete, zvakare.
You can see this too.	Unogona kuona izvi zvakare.
It was easy.	Zvakanga zviri nyore.
.	.
She was a woman, but she was not a man.	Akanga ari mukadzi, asi akanga asiri munhu.
I wanted to go to school and be a teacher.	Ndaida kuenda kuchikoro uye kuva mudzidzisi.
And not without you.	Uye kwete pasina iwe.
And that's not all.	Uye handizvo zvese izvi.
In fact, he did more than that.	Kutaura chokwadi, akaita zvakawanda kupfuura izvozvo.
Another nice place.	Imwe nzvimbo yakanaka.
It is not just a good idea.	Haisi pfungwa yakanaka chete.
He had to be alone.	Aifanira kunge ari ega .
There is no place for me.	Hapana nzvimbo yangu.
Maybe he still does.	Pamwe achiri kudaro.
Here a man can do anything.	Pano murume anogona kuita chero chinhu.
Of course they are here.	Ichokwadi kuti vari pano.
There is not enough money, though.	Hapana mari yakakwana, zvakadaro.
Not as if you were winning any money.	Kwete sekuti uri kuhwina chero mari.
.	.
So it is with me, though.	Zvakadaro kwandiri, zvakadaro.
We have to do it.	Tinofanira kuzviita.
No, he is fine.	Kwete, akanaka.
You don't have to.	Haufanire kudaro.
Isn't it? 	Handizvo here?
The teacher was not a person.	Mudzidzisi akanga asiri munhu.
I have to talk to you.	Ndinofanira kutaura newe.
I can help a lot.	Ndinogona kubatsira zvakanyanya.
The answer, too, is very simple.	Mhinduro, zvakare, iri nyore kwazvo.
And this was good.	Uye izvi zvakanga zvakanaka.
You are far from it.	Iwe uri kure nazvo.
He must see and hear.	Anofanira kuona uye kunzwa.
He could have thought of something else.	Angadai akafunga chimwe chinhu.
Things to have.	Zvinhu kuva nazvo.
The boy has to learn a trade.	Mukomana anofanira kudzidza basa.
We can try.	Tinogona kuedza.
A woman can be anyone.	Mukadzi anogona kuva chero munhu.
This, of course, is what happened.	Izvi, zvechokwadi, ndizvo zvakaitika.
You have to start early.	Unofanira kutanga kare.
.	.
But he didn't do it tonight.	Asi haana kuzviita manheru ano.
Here you are.	Uri pano.
He can walk a little.	Anogona kufamba zvishoma.
I can't do it.	Handikwanise kuzviita.
Not good but working.	Kwete kunaka asi kushanda.
And this will happen.	Uye izvi zvichaitika.
I want to know what it is.	Ndinoda kuziva kuti chii.
I want to eat well.	Ndinoda kudya zvakanaka.
That offer.	Ko kutanga.
Not so here, on earth.	Hazvina kudaro pano, pasi pano.
Now he has done that.	Iye zvino aita izvozvo.
But it was good.	Asi zvakanga zvakanaka.
That is the choice.	Ndiyo sarudzo.
I hope that's true.	Ndinovimba kuti ichokwadi.
You should not think that it is possible.	Haufanire kufunga kuti zvinoita.
If too close.	Kana pedyo zvikuru.
I heard something.	Ndakanzwa chimwe chinhu.
I would not have known.	ndingadai ndisina kuziva.
I have to be happy.	Ndinofanira kufara.
No, no, no.	Hapana, hapana, hapana.
And it is easy to see why.	Uye zviri nyore kuona kuti sei.
Or his.	Kana kuti zvake.
People are here.	Vanhu vari pano.
Especially if a lot is happening.	Kunyanya kana zvakawanda zviri kuitika.
He has to make a decision.	Anofanira kuita sarudzo.
But you know something.	Asi iwe unoziva chimwe chinhu.
He says he doesn't want to.	Anoti haadi.
We did not play well.	Hatina kutamba zvakanaka.
He can learn.	Anogona kudzidza.
He wanted that.	Aida izvozvo.
But he refused.	Asi akaramba.

Not just coming.	Kwete kuuya chete.
But now he had to go.	Asi zvino aifanira kuenda.

Of course this was hard to find.	Chokwadi izvi zvakanga zvakaoma kuwana.

Or I am the only one.	Kana kuti ndini chete.
The baby had it.	Mwana anga ave nazvo.
But that was easy.	Asi izvozvo zvakanga zviri nyore.
You can do this.	Unogona kuita izvi.

Of course, you really want to.	Chokwadi, unoda chaizvo.
No one could help.	Hapana aigona kubatsira.
He doesn't even care about all of us.	Haana kana hanya nesu tose.
He wants answers now.	Anoda mhinduro manje.
Probably no one knew who he was.	Pamwe hapana aiziva kuti aiva ani.
He wanted to do everything.	Aida kuita zvose.
He did not say much.	Akanga asina kutaura zvakawanda.
And outside.	Uye kunze .

He thought he was doing something good.	Aifunga kuti akanga ari kuita chinhu chakanaka.

You have to start right now.	Unofanira kutanga izvozvi.
He wasn't sure what else.	Akanga asina chokwadi kuti chii chimwe.
I felt powerless.	Ndakanzwa ndisina simba.
I know how difficult it is here.	Ndinoziva kuti pano zvakaoma sei.
He did not want to be alone again.	Akanga asingadi kuva ega zvakare.
My son.	Mwana wangu.
The girl is the most beautiful girl of all.	Musikana ndiye musikana akanaka kupfuura vese.
Probably his only friend.	Pamwe shamwari yake imwe chete.
I can try that.	Ndinogona kuedza izvozvo.
I know he doesn't care about me.	Ndinoziva kuti haana basa neni.
I still want to know the answer.	Ndichiri kuda kuziva mhinduro.

Of course, you know that you are a good teacher.	Chokwadi, unoziva kuti uri mudzidzisi akanaka.
She began to worry.	Akatanga kunetseka.
No one wants to make a decision.	Hapana anoda kuita sarudzo.

I'm happy with it.	Ndiri kufara nazvo.
I didn't know what it was.	Ndakashaya kuti chii.
Top to bottom.	Pamusoro kusvika pasi.
There are enough things to do.	Pane zvinhu zvakakwana zvekuita.
I wanted to be honest and open about it.	Ndaida kubuda pachena uye kutaura chokwadi nezvazvo.
The man then left.	Murume akabva aenda.
There is another reason.	Pane chimwe chikonzero.
He wasn't big, and he wasn't small.	Akanga asiri mukuru, uye akanga asiri mudiki.
I'm happy with it.	Ndiri kufara nazvo.

If he was alone, that would be fine.	Dai akanga ari ega, zvakanga zvakanaka.

None of that.	Hapana izvozvi.
He seemed to be waiting for someone.	Aiita kunge akamirira munhu.
Expect to read more.	Kutarisira kuverenga zvakawanda.
He said he had.	Akati akanga ane.
He was far away.	Akanga ari kure.
But that is his story.	Asi ndiyo nyaya yake.
Sure he could, easy.	Chokwadi aigona, nyore.
But he did not want to think about it now.	Asi akanga asingadi kufunga nezvazvo iye zvino.
Of course, we are convinced that it is.	Chokwadi, tine chokwadi chekuti ndizvo.
He did more than that.	Akaita zvakawanda kupfuura izvozvo.

But no.	Asi kwete.

But again it makes no sense.	Asi zvakare hazvina musoro.
I have to say this.	Ndinofanira kutaura izvi.

He was a boy.	Akanga ari mukomana.
Well obviously, this time it’s not.	Zvakanaka zviri pachena, panguva ino handizvo.
I love everything at the same time.	Ndinoda zvinhu zvose panguva imwe chete.
He waited.	Akamirira.
The answer is no.	Mhinduro yacho hapana kana zvese.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Pamwe kwete nhasi, pamwe kwete mangwana, asi nekukurumidza.
But it is not a good answer.	Asi haisi mhinduro yakanaka.
It doesn't even read.	Hazvina kana kuverenga.
And now, you can sleep well.	Uye zvino, unogona kurara zvakanaka.
He was another boy.	Akanga ari mumwe mukomana.
He did not start a story.	Haana kutanga nyaya.
He was.	Akanga ari .
Then he left again.	Akabva aenda zvakare.
Hard to try.	Zvakaoma kuedza.

Or good luck.	Kana kuti rombo rakanaka.
If you can do this.	Kana iwe unogona kuita izvi.
He did better.	Akaita zviri nani.
You can talk.	Unogona kutaura.
Great girl.	Musikana mukuru.
It looks good.	Zvinoita kunge zvakanaka.
Far too often.	Kure kazhinji.

Now she can't hear that.	Iye zvino haakwanisi kunzwa izvozvo.
There are only so many things happening.	Pane zvimwe chete zvinhu zviri kuitika.
And he continued to do so.	Uye akaramba akadaro.
Everything is clear.	Zvose zviri pachena.
Maybe you are lucky.	Pamwe une rombo rakanaka.

I found it hard to believe.	Ndakaona kuti zvakaoma kutenda.
That was really good.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka chaizvo.
And he has a good place.	Uye ane nzvimbo yakanaka.
We can do this.	Tinogona kuita izvi.

He is lucky to have a job.	Ane rombo rakanaka kuwana basa.
I know it is not that easy.	Ndinoziva hazvisi nyore kudaro.

Things like that.	Zvinhu zvakadaro.
He needed to know.	Aifanira kuziva.
He did not understand all this.	Haana kunzwisisa zvese izvi.
He seems to be alone.	Anoita kunge ari ega.
And almost anyone can say anything.	Uye anenge munhu wese anogona kutaura chero chinhu.
She was a little girl then.	Akanga ari musikana zvishoma ipapo.

He said he didn't, but he could.	Akati akanga asina, asi aigona.
No time now.	Hapana nguva manje.

You should see a doctor.	Unofanira kuona chiremba.
You can't do it here.	Iwe haugone kuzviita pano.
But there is really no answer to some questions.	Asi zvechokwadi hapana mhinduro kune zvimwe zvinhu.
For some things, it's hard to say.	Kune zvimwe zvinhu, zvakaoma kutaura.
That's the great things.	Ndizvo zvinhu zvikuru.

Much like everyone else.	Zvakawanda sezvakaita munhu wese.
He was far away.	Akanga ari kure.
Then you can help.	Ipapo unogona kubatsira.
There is no house at all.	Hapana imba zvachose.
You have a long way to go with him tonight.	Une nzira refu naye manheru ano.
It is not always.	Haisi nguva nenguva.
My baby loves to eat.	Mwana wangu anoda kudya.
I can do a lot.	Ndinogona kuita zvakanyanya.
And we can get some.	Uye tinogona kuwana zvimwe.
This really is not good at all.	Izvi chaizvo hazvina kunaka zvachose.

If he does, fine.	Kana akadaro, zvakanaka.
He was good to me.	Aive akanaka kwandiri.
He's here somewhere.	Ari pano pane imwe nzvimbo.

But the answer is very simple.	Asi mhinduro yacho iri nyore kwazvo.
There is a time for having children.	Pane nguva yekuita vana.
He has power over the weak.	Ane simba pamusoro asina simba.

You don't have to think that.	Haufanire kufunga izvozvo.
Or did he think that he should?	Kana kuti aifunga kuti aifanira.
He said he was alone.	Akati akanga ari oga.
I'm scared.	Ndinotya ini.
He can be anyone.	Anogona kunge ari chero munhu.
And he did.	Uye akaita.
We could not have had a better time.	Hatina kukwanisa kuva nenguva iri nani.

And he cares about that.	Uye ane hanya nazvo.
Or, no one cares.	Kana kuti, hapana ane basa.
He was a very close person to us.	Aiva munhu ari pedyo nesu.
He saw that she was beautiful.	Akaona kuti akanga akanaka.
Or what.	Kana kuti chii.
Or he can do anything.	Kana kuti anogona kuita chero chinhu.
That is the point.	Ndiyo nyaya yacho.
Good night.	Manheru akanaka.
This, of course, is absurd.	Chokwadi izvi hazvina musoro.
All right, friends.	Zvakanaka, shamwari.
It did not move.	Hazvina kufamba.
No one was better.	Hapana akanga ave nani.

You have to eat.	Unofanira kudya.

But you have to talk to me.	Asi unofanira kutaura neni.
She's not a girl, a boy.	Haasi musikana, mukomana.
He did not see everything.	Haana kuona zvinhu zvose.
It doesn't make sense at all.	Hazvina musoro zvachose.
Nothing to do.	Hapana kuita.
Maybe, maybe not.	Pamwe, pamwe kwete.
He had a good new one.	Akanga ane itsva yakanaka.
We know we have so much.	Tinoziva kuti tine zvakawanda kwazvo.
To be a good man.	Kuva murume akanaka.
I saw a doctor.	Ndakaona chiremba.
He is always waiting for the good things to come.	Anogara akamirira zvinhu zvakanaka.
But to no avail.	Asi hazvina kubatsira.
Nothing is being done.	Hapana chiri kuitwa.
No one knew why.	Hapana aiziva chikonzero.
No police think.	Hapana mapurisa anofunga.
Winning the truth.	Kuhwina chokwadi.
No nothing out.	Kwete hapana kunze.
That girl, woman, had to be.	Kuti musikana, mukadzi, aifanira kuva.
And that, of course, is good for me.	Uye izvo, zvechokwadi, zvakanaka neni.
And that is not easy.	Uye izvozvo hazvisi nyore.

But not too much to worry about.	Asi kwete kunyanya kunetseka.
He thought he could live far away.	Aifunga kuti aigona kugara kure zvachose.

You have to make that decision.	Unofanira kuita sarudzo iyoyo.
Good enough, obviously.	Zvakanaka zvakakwana, zviri pachena.

I wanted to work with him.	Ndaida kushanda naye.
Not too far away.	Kwete kure zvakanyanya.

No dancing.	Hapana kutamba.
It is not difficult.	Hazvisi zvakaoma.
He told me he cared about me.	Akandiudza kuti ane hanya neni.
Maybe he would get lucky.	Pamwe aizoita rombo rakanaka.
At this point you can't do that.	Panguva ino haugone kudaro.
You can take this a little bit.	Unogona kutora izvi zvishoma.
But this is not going to happen.	Asi izvi hazvisi kuenda.
He did not sleep.	Haana kurara.
I had not.	Ndakanga ndisina.
Now the process is easier than ever.	Iye zvino nzira yacho iri nyore kupfuura kare.
He certainly did not say much.	Chokwadi haana kutaura zvakawanda.
But someone has to say.	Asi mumwe munhu anofanira kutaura.
Or be it all.	Kana kuva zvose.
And especially worrying.	Uye kunyanya kunetseka.

And a little bit more.	Uye zvishoma zvishoma.
He does not want to eat anything, alone.	Haadi kudya chimwe chinhu, ari ega.
Not a lot of money.	Kwete mari yakawanda.
He decided to go home.	Akafunga kuenda kumba.
He seemed to be his.	Aiita kunge wake.
He knew this.	Aiziva izvi.
He wanted this.	Aida izvi.
I need someone.	Ndinoda mumwe munhu.
They're trying to get something.	Vari kuedza kuwana chimwe chinhu.
It is difficult to know what is right.	Zvakaoma kuziva chakanaka.
This letter is good.	Tsamba iyi yakanaka.
You can sing here, but not there.	Unogona kuimba pano, asi kwete ipapo.
People are close together.	Vanhu vari pedyo pamwe chete.
He can be nice, hard to tell the truth.	Anogona kunge akanaka, zvakaoma kutaura chokwadi.
He was close.	Akanga ari pedyo.
There is not enough space here, really.	Hapana nzvimbo yakakwana pano, chaizvo.
It was a beautiful evening.	Aive manheru akanaka.
He is doing everything.	Ari kuita zvose.
It doesn't matter much.	Hazvina basa zvakanyanya.
Not good luck.	Kwete rombo rakanaka.

Not me then.	Kwete ini ipapo.
And he couldn't do it.	Uye haana kukwanisa kuzviita.

And, it is not easy.	Uye, haisi nyore.
But he was not surprised.	Asi haana kushamisika.
He is both and is not at the same time.	Ari zvose uye haasi panguva imwe chete.
Only mine.	Yangu chete.
I am not.	Handisi ini.
I would have known that.	Ndingadai ndakaziva izvozvo.
And he still does.	Uye achiri kudaro.
You can learn to do this.	Unogona kudzidza kuita izvi.
He doesn't want it at all.	Haadi zvachose.
He cares about you.	Ane hanya newe.
Another prison.	Mumwe mujeri.
He was doing.	Akanga achiita.
But he enjoys playing.	Asi anofarira kutamba.
And winning a lot.	Uye kuhwina zvikuru.
The answer is very simple.	Mhinduro iri nyore chaizvo.
He would probably be better off without it.	Pamwe angadai ari nani pasina izvozvo.
A child should not see such things.	Mwana haafaniri kuona zvinhu zvakadaro.
I don't think so.	handifungi kudaro.

No, guilt.	Kwete, mhosva.
There is no choice.	Hapana sarudzo.

He did not want to go.	Akanga asingadi kuenda.

You need us.	Unoda isu.
He thought this.	Akafunga izvi.
You can go home.	Unogona kuenda kumba.
He could have done this for no reason.	Aigona kuzviita pasina chikonzero.
Of course he can't stay that way.	Chokwadi haakwanisi kugara akadaro.
She was beautiful.	Akanga akanaka.
The older man slept less.	Murume mukuru akarara zvishoma.
It doesn't make sense.	Hazvina musoro.
I don’t want to say anything about it, though.	Ini handidi kutaura chero chinhu nezvazvo, zvakadaro.
All right, whatever good.	Zvakanaka, chero zvakanaka.

It is certainly easier to talk to him.	Chokwadi zviri nyore kutaura naye.
I want to feel good.	Ndinoda kunzwa zvakanaka.
No one else wants this.	Hapana mumwe anoda izvi.
Well, a little more.	Zvakanaka, kupfuura zvishoma.

You know if you're doing something.	Unoziva kana uri kuita chimwe chinhu.
And she was beautiful.	Uye akanga akanaka.
I can't figure out why.	Handikwanise kuziva kuti sei zvakadaro.
He should not talk to me.	Haafanire kutaura neni.
But he did not want to do it.	Asi akanga asingadi kuzviita.
He wanted to learn more.	Aida kudzidza zvakawanda.
We have a lot.	Tine zvakawanda.
But we must do something urgent.	Asi tinofanira kuita chimwe chinhu nokukurumidza.
That's nice.	Kuti akanaka.
He could do that.	Aigona kudaro.
He seemed to be far away.	Aiita kunge ari kure.
He could not pretend that he did not.	Haana kukwanisa kuita seasina kudaro.
He was not good.	Akanga asina kunaka.
It is difficult but it will happen.	Zvakaoma asi zvichaitika.
He was lucky there.	Akaita rombo rakanaka ipapo.
He was, he admitted, good.	Akanga ari, akabvuma, anga akanaka.
But it did not work.	Asi hazvina kushanda.
There is only one way.	Pane nzira imwe chete.
He didn't care about it all.	Akanga asina basa nazvo zvose.
I wanted to be with him.	Ndaida kuva naye.
But happy too.	Asi kufara zvakare.
And being me.	Uye kuva ini.

We are working remotely.	Tiri kushanda kure.

I want to plan.	Ndinoda kuronga.
You have to stop.	Unofanira kurega.
He could come out at any moment.	Aigona kubuda chero nguva.

You can say a lot.	Unogona kutaura zvakawanda.
You and I, too.	Iwe neni, zvakare.
He is my boyfriend.	Ndiye mukomana wangu.
He looks like a small child.	Anoita kunge mwana mudiki.
We have no problem with it so far.	Hatina kana dambudziko nazvo kusvika panguva ino.
At any time, any time, no time.	Pane imwe nguva, chero nguva, hapana nguva.
And he could see the reason.	Uye aigona kuona chikonzero.
He needed to know.	Aifanira kuziva.
That's easy.	Zviri nyore izvozvo.
But he was not doing that.	Asi akanga asiri kuita izvozvo.
Or so he thought.	Kana kuti akafunga kudaro.
Or problem, or what you.	Kana dambudziko, kana chii iwe.
No one is around.	Hapana munhu pedyo.

And we need to know who did this.	Uye tinofanira kuziva kuti ndiani akaita izvi.
I fly with him.	Ndega naye.
Good boy.	Akanaka mwana mukomana.
He was not just my friend.	Akanga asiri shamwari yangu chete.
He sat down and looked.	Akagara pasi akatarisa.
He was a good man.	Aiva munhu akanaka.
But, there is a way.	Asi, pane nzira.
I am a man without a car.	Ndiri murume asina mota.
Everything is moving.	Zvese zviri kufamba.
I'm sure this time is true.	Ndine chokwadi kuti nguva ino ichokwadi.
I really enjoy it.	Ndiri kufara nazvo chaizvo.
He was doing well.	Akanga ari kuita zvakanaka.
But she was not feeling well.	Asi akanga asiri kunzwa zvakanaka.
I had no idea.	Ndanga ndisina kufunga.
I'm not the only one saying that.	Handisi ini ndega ndiri kutaura izvozvo.
Who knows the person.	Ndiani anoziva munhu.
It is not all that difficult.	Hazvina zvese zvakaoma kudaro.
Of course it was good.	Chokwadi zvakanga zvakanaka.
There is more to do.	Pane zvimwe zvekuita.
I can't wait for next week.	Handikwanise kumirira svondo rinouya.
That's one of them.	Ndiyo imwe yacho.
I want to hear why.	Ndinoda kunzwa kuti sei.
I have to stay here right now.	Ndinofanira kugara pano izvozvi.
That does not make sense.	Izvozvo hazvina musoro.
Common sense.	Zviri pachena.
But it doesn't matter a bit anymore.	Asi hazvina basa zvishoma zvakare.
He thinks he is young, but he is not.	Anofunga kuti mudiki, asi haasi.
He was not good.	Akanga asina kunaka.
But he had no interest in her at all.	Asi akanga asina basa naye zvachose.
A lot of good things are happening.	Zvakawanda zvakanaka zviri kuitika.
I want to get out.	Ndinoda kubuda.
He began to hear things.	Akatanga kunzwa zvinhu.
That or not, or both.	Izvozvo kana kurega, kana zvose.
Well, there is a lot going on.	Zvakanaka, pane zvakawanda zviri kuitika.
But he has money.	Asi ane mari.
Not so.	Hazvina kudaro.
It is better to do something with it.	Zviri nani kuita chimwe chinhu nazvo.
And that was fine.	Uye izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka.
How difficult that is.	Zvakaoma sei izvozvo.
We know what to do.	Tinoziva zvekuita.
Good player.	Mutambi akanaka.
This is not fair.	Izvi hazvina kunaka.
Good luck, though.	Rombo rakanaka, zvakadaro.
She was not a sensible girl.	Akanga asiri musikana ane musoro.
I could not stop coming.	Handina kukwanisa kurega kuuya.
And this is hard to do.	Uye izvi zvakaoma kuita.
There is no such thing.	Hapana zvakadaro.
This, in general, is not true.	Izvi, kazhinji, hazvisi zvechokwadi.
He did not want that much money.	Aisada mari yakawanda kudaro.
No time.	Hapana nguva.
I'm still thinking about it.	Ndichiri kufunga nezvazvo.
A child needs time.	Mwana anoda nguva.
There is a lot going on.	Pane zvakawanda zviri kuitika.
You need to stop sleeping altogether.	Unofanira kurega kurara zvachose.
I am his.	Ini ndiri wake.
There is no other way.	Hapana imwe nzira.
But there is something else.	Asi pane chimwe chinhu.
Everyone made the truth.	Munhu wese akaita chokwadi.
Instead of how he is now.	Pane kuti ave sei iye zvino.
And you should have been his friend.	Uye waifanira kunge uri shamwari yake.
One, however.	Imwe chete, zvakadaro.
If you are at home, you can eat.	Kana uri kumba, unogona kudya.
That's the help.	Ndiyo rubatsiro.
I wanted to be able to play.	Ndaida kukwanisa kutamba.
Maybe he can help.	Pamwe anogona kubatsira.
I want to know about it.	Ndiri kuda kuziva nezvazvo.
Looking forward to returning to work.	Kutarisira kudzokera kubasa.
Again, the same thing.	Zvakare, chinhu chimwe chete.
They are there.	Vari ipapo.
He didn't know what else.	Akashaya kuti chii chimwe.
Someone is talking to me.	Pane ari kutaura neni.
He was still happy.	Akanga achiri kufara.
You know.	Iwe uri kuziva.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka chaizvo.
She is beautiful.	Akanaka.
He thought to himself.	Aifunga ega.

Surely someone is curious.	Chokwadi mumwe munhu anenge achida kuziva.
Down below.	Pasi pasi.
He didn't wait to tell me all about it.	Haana kumirira kundiudza zvese nezvazvo.
Everything is simple.	Zvese zviri nyore.
Handsome boy.	Mukomana akanaka.
Maybe you're on something here.	Pamwe uri pane chimwe chinhu pano.
He was a good child.	Ari aive mwana akanaka.
You need to eat more.	Unofanira kudya zvakawanda.
This is not true.	Izvi hazvisi zvechokwadi.
I'm here now.	Ndiri pano zvino.
I am happy to help.	Ndinofara kubatsira.
Well, he thought.	Zvakanaka, akafunga.
He is very concerned.	Ane hanya zvikuru.
It doesn't work.	Hazvisi kushanda.
That's what people do.	Ndizvo zvinoita vanhu.
I thought this.	Ndakafunga izvi.
Sure he would now, but he didn't.	Chokwadi aizoita zvino, asi haana.
He didn't just want to see.	Akanga asingadi kuona chete.
I need help with this.	Ndinoda rubatsiro pane izvi.
I heard that there was more.	Ndakanzwa kuti pane zvimwe.
My good boyfriend.	Mukomana wangu akanaka.
I thought about it.	Ndaifunga nezvazvo.
He has no choice.	Haana sarudzo.
No one was younger.	Hapana aiva mudiki.
You have to buy the book.	Unofanira kutenga bhuku racho.
I still do it from time to time.	Ndichiri kuzviita nguva nenguva.
I had to do it.	Ndaifanira kuzviita.
But not for long.	Asi kwete kwenguva refu.
This was very difficult.	Izvi zvakanga zvakaoma zvikuru.
Time is the problem.	Nguva ndiyo dambudziko.
But that's fine, too.	Asi izvozvo zvakanaka, zvakare.
He didn't care for me.	Haana kuita hanya neni.
He was a very, very human person.	Akanga ari munhu zvikuru, zvikuru.
But he ignored it.	Asi haana kuita hanya nazvo.
What is?.	Chii?.
He wanted to go, he told me.	Aida kuenda, akandiudza.
We can be those things too.	Tinogona kuva zvinhu izvozvo zvakare.
I do not want to leave here obviously.	Handidi kubva pano zviri pachena.
He can do it, too.	Anogona kuzviita, zvakare.
Of course there is no other option.	Chokwadi hapana imwe sarudzo.
He did not stop going.	Haana kurega kuenda.
Not more, everything.	Kwete zvimwe, zvese.
I thought you probably knew.	Ndaifunga kuti pamwe waiziva.
she said.	akati.
He seemed very happy.	Airatidza kufara chaizvo.
I didn't know why.	Ndakashaya kuti sei.
But there is another reason.	Asi pane chimwe chikonzero.
But this is absurd.	Asi izvi hazvina musoro.
You are not even here.	Hausi kana pano.
I'm a job, that's all.	Ndiri basa, ndizvo chete.
Not from.	Kwete kubva .
Again there is no answer.	Zvakare hapana mhinduro.
But another child can.	Asi mumwe mwana anogona.
She has children with him.	Ane vana naye.
I am with my wife.	Ndine mukadzi wangu.
You can't get there from here.	Iwe haugone kusvika ipapo kubva pano.
We did not know why.	Hatina kuziva kuti sei.
I wanted to hear something good.	Ndaida kunzwa chimwe chinhu chakanaka.
That's just what happened.	Ndizvo zvakaitika chete.
It's very simple.	Zviri nyore kwazvo.
I never thought about it.	Handina kumbofunga nezvazvo.
I'm sure of that.	Ndine chokwadi nazvo.
It was still early in the morning.	Akanga achiri mangwanani.
And it is very beautiful.	Uye yakanaka chaizvo.
He doesn't want her to go now.	Haadi kuti aende manje.
Everyone knew something.	Munhu wese aiziva chimwe chinhu.
There is more.	Pane zvimwe.
No issues.	Pasina nyaya.
Letter from me.	Tsamba kubva kwandiri.
All of this is irrelevant.	Zvese izvi hazvina basa.
We have to walk, and walk fast.	Tinofanira kufamba, uye kufamba nekukurumidza.
Now we can speak well for a long time.	Zvino tinogona kutaura zvakanaka kwenguva refu.
But it is not true.	Asi hazvisi zvechokwadi.
I thought about it.	Ndakafunga nezvazvo.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka chaizvo.
He was not lucky.	Akanga asina rombo rakanaka.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ndinovimba munhu wese ari kuita zvakanaka.
You can do it right now.	Unogona kuzviita izvozvi.
From the ground up.	Kubva pasi.
She is not sure.	Haana chokwadi.
But he told me enough.	Asi akandiudza zvakakwana.
There is nothing.	Kune chero .
You can do it at any time.	Unogona kuzviita chero nguva.
I think this is a good time.	Ndinofunga nguva ino yakanaka.
Not really expecting that.	Kwete chaizvo kutarisira izvozvo.
Too much.	Zvakawanda kwazvo.
I don't think you can do anything.	Handifungi kuti unogona kuita chimwe chinhu.
But it's hard to say.	Asi zvakaoma kutaura.
He must love this.	Anofanira kunge achida izvi.
That's all at once.	Ndizvo zvose panguva imwe chete.
Did he think so.	Ko iye akafunga kudaro.
The woman is lying there.	Mukadzi akarara ipapo.
He should have stopped doing so.	Aifanira kurega kuita izvozvo.
But it's not you.	Asi hausi iwe.
It is very difficult.	Zvakaoma zvikuru.
I have to do it.	Ndinofanira kuzviita.
There is only one answer.	Pane mhinduro imwe chete.
It was good, very good.	Zvakanga zvakanaka, zvakanaka kwazvo.
The older man was gone.	Murume mukuru akanga aenda.
He has been away for some time.	Ave nenguva asipo.
There is no right answer.	Hapana kana mhinduro yakanaka.
Passing no place, no time.	Kupfuura hapana nzvimbo, hapana nguva.
He can play.	Anogona kutamba .
Everything was fine.	Zvose zvakanga zvakanaka.
The problem.	Dambudziko .
But there is more to it than that.	Asi zvakawanda kupfuura izvozvo.
I feel better today.	Ndiri kunzwa zviri nani nhasi.
We must be able to be.	Tinofanira kukwanisa kuva.
He didn't care too much about it.	Akanga asina basa nazvo zvakanyanya.
It doesn't make sense.	Hazvina musoro.
Dog breeding.	Kunyanya imbwa.
He was not sure of her.	Akanga asina chokwadi naye.
I can probably do this.	Ndinogona pamwe kuita izvi.
I have to admit that.	Ndinofanira kubvuma izvozvo.
Okay but it doesn't matter.	Zvakanaka asi hazvina basa.
Such a good one.	Akanaka akadaro.
I love how easy it is.	Ndinoda kuti zviri nyore sei.
But he knows it is not coming.	Asi anoziva kuti haisi kuuya.
This too is absurd.	Izvi zvakare hazvina musoro.
I had to get out.	Ndaifanira kubuda.
How beautiful she was.	Aive akanaka sei.
No one looked.	Hapana akatarisa.
And then the car.	Uye ipapo motokari.

You can't really walk.	Iwe haugone kufamba chaizvo.
It's a really good thing.	Chinhu chakanaka chaizvo.
He can stay or come.	Anogona kugara kana kuuya.
It's very simple.	Zviri nyore chaizvo.
But it is true.	Asi ichokwadi.
Maybe he should take more.	Pamwe anofanira kutora zvakawanda.
We can talk to him in the morning.	Tinogona kutaura naye mangwanani.
This is it, that and that.	Izvi ndizvo, izvo uye zvakadaro.
And love and affection.	Uye kuda uye kuda.
It's not easy.	Hazvisi nyore.
I can be close to you.	Ndinogona kuva pedyo newe.
Only this time.	Nguva ino chete.
He could have done so.	Angadai akadaro.
This is going well so far.	Izvi zviri kufamba zvakanaka kusvika zvino.
That and other things.	Izvo uye zvimwe zvinhu.
But the doctor does his job anyway.	Asi chiremba anoita basa rake zvakadaro.
This is not the case at all.	Izvi hazvina kudaro zvachose.
All right, all right.	Zvakanaka, zvakanaka.
He went with me.	Akaenda neni.
And faith is good.	Uye kutenda kunaka ndizvo.
That is not the case in the past.	Handizvo zvakaitika kare.
She is my girlfriend.	Ndiye musikana wangu.
One good dog.	Imwe imbwa yakanaka.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
There is nothing.	Hapana pasina.
But that is not fair.	Asi izvozvo hazvina kunaka.
That was good.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka.
Obviously, this did not happen.	Zviri pachena kuti izvi hazvina kuitika.
I want to talk to him now.	Ndinoda kutaura naye manje.
She was beautiful, she thought.	Akanga akanaka, akafunga.
He was not walking.	Akanga asiri kufamba.
And obviously.	Uye zviri pachena.
Of course it is.	Chokwadi ndizvo chaizvo.
A caring person.	Munhu ane hanya.
But, he had to go.	Asi, aifanira kuenda.
Easy going.	Zviri nyore.
But you must think about what you are doing.	Asi unofanira kufunga zvauri kuita.
You can, too.	Unogona kudaro, zvakare.
I have to be close.	Ndinofanira kunge ndiri pedyo.
It did not sit well.	Hazvina kugara zvakanaka.
This is going a long way.	Izvi zviri kuenda kure.
And he is not alone.	Uye haasi iye ega.
I would not have had a better chance.	Ndingadai ndisina mukana uri nani.
And she is beautiful.	Uye akanaka.
His work, and no one else.	Basa rake, uye hapana mumwe.
It was hard to say.	Zvakanga zvakaoma kutaura.
This is what it is here for.	Izvi ndizvo zviri pano.
I think we can do it.	Ndinofunga tinogona kuzviita.
It could be him.	Anogona kunge ari iye.
More, faster.	Zvakawanda, nekukurumidza.
I think he loves the story.	Ndinofunga kuti anoda nyaya yacho.
They have not tried so hard.	Havana kuedza zvakanyanya zvakadaro.
You can't make yourself human.	Iwe haugone kuzviita munhu.
I really want to say that.	Ndinoda chaizvo kutaura izvozvo.
That's what you are.	Ndizvo zvauri.
This is completely absurd.	Izvi hazvina musoro zvachose.
That he will do well.	Kuti achaita zvakanaka.
He looked surprised.	Airatidza kushamisika.
He looked like a great man.	Aiita kunge murume mukuru.
I want to work with him.	Ndinoda kushanda naye.
He was only three years old at the time.	Aiva nemakore matatu chete panguva iyoyo.
I hope so.	Ndinovimba izvozvo.
The police are not sure.	Mapurisa haana chokwadi.
He was a man at that time.	Akanga ari munhu panguva iyoyo.
Surely someone must have known about that.	Chokwadi mumwe munhu anofanira kunge akaziva nezvazvo.
That's the same thing.	Ndiyo nyaya imwe chete.
These things are very easy to know.	Izvi zvinhu zviri nyore chaizvo kuziva.
Asking for more.	Kukumbira zvimwe.
But it was certainly so.	Asi zvechokwadi zvakanga zvakadaro.

He seemed to be waiting.	Aiita kunge akamirira.
But sometimes.	Asi imwe nguva.
He has his perfect.	Ane zvake zvakakwana.
We need to go beyond that.	Tinofanira kupfuura izvi.
No one knew.	Hapana aiziva.
And he has power there.	Uye ane simba ipapo.

And the reason is obvious.	Uye chikonzero chiri pachena.
I didn't want to talk to her.	Ndaisada kutaura naye.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ndinovimba munhu wese ari kuita zvakanaka.

No, not this time.	Kwete, kwete nguva ino.
This is easy to understand.	Izvi zviri nyore kunzwisisa.
The woman did not see.	Mukadzi haana kuona.
Maybe he could, then.	Pamwe aigona, ipapo.
More than a person.	Kupfuura munhu.

And he did a good job with it.	Uye akaita basa rakanaka nazvo.
You are not a person at all.	Hausi munhu asina mhosva zvachose.

He did not want an empty night.	Aisada manheru asina chinhu.
You can't go back there, though.	Iwe haugone kudzokera ikoko, zvakadaro.

He heard, rather than see, the house.	Akanzwa, pane kuona, imba yacho.
You are usually not the only one.	Iwe kazhinji hausi mukuru chete.
Or at least, we can have it all.	Kana kuti zvishoma, tinogona kuva nazvo zvose.

He said he was.	Akati aiva.
Here we do not have this problem.	Pano hatina dambudziko iri.

Probably especially then.	Pamwe kunyanya ipapo.
It doesn't make sense.	Hazvina musoro.
He can't do it.	Haakwanisi kuzviita.
He was much easier than that.	Akanga ari nyore zvikuru kupfuura izvozvo.
We didn't talk about it.	Hatina kutaura nezvazvo.
He was just one boy, he was.	Akanga ari mukomana mumwe chete, akanga ari.
But it is not easy.	Asi hazvisi nyore.

She is not a girl.	Haasi musikana.
He was now, he was now for sure.	Ndiye aive iye zvino, aive iye zvino chokwadi.
It had to be him.	Aifanira kunge ari iye.
There is often much more to it than that.	Kazhinji kune zvakawanda zvikuru kupfuura izvozvo.
And he doesn't care about it.	Uye haana basa nazvo.
But money, not.	Asi mari, kwete.
I wanted to stay out.	Ndaida kugara kunze.

No one else is to blame here.	Hapana mumwe munhu ane mhosva pano.

Now, he was skeptical.	Zvino, akanga asina chokwadi.
This is working perfectly so far.	Izvi zviri kushanda zvakakwana kusvika zvino.
He was about to.	Akanga ava kuda.

This is not helpful.	Iyi haisi rubatsiro.
Well, it doesn't matter.	Zvakanaka, hazvina basa.
She rejected the boy.	Akaramba mukomana.

Nothing is easier.	Hapana chiri nyore.

He wanted to be at home.	Aida kuva pamba.
Food is better than ever.	Chikafu chiri nani kupfuura kare.
He refused anyway.	Akaramba zvakadaro.
This alone, and nothing more.	Izvi chete, uye hapana zvimwe.
He is sure.	Ane chokwadi.

He said he wanted to do it.	Akati aida kuita.
And then you love people.	Uye ipapo unoda vanhu.

We have an idea.	Tine pfungwa.
You can go.	Unogona kuenda.
Friends are also a very good player.	Shamwari zvakare mutambi akanaka kwazvo.
No one told me about it.	Hapana akandiudza nezvazvo .
That's too much.	Izvo zvakanyanya.
My answer is very simple.	Mhinduro yangu iri nyore kwazvo.
From another point of view, this is obvious.	Kubva pane imwe pfungwa, izvi zviri pachena.
The morning was beautiful too.	Mangwanani aive akanaka zvakare.
That's fine, that's fine.	Izvo zvakanaka, ndizvo.
He knows we are coming.	Anoziva kuti tiri kuuya.
Well, he thought.	Zvakanaka, akafunga.
I'm happy with that.	Ndinofara nazvo.
He did not want this.	Akanga asingadi izvi.
He could say a lot when he was here.	Aigona kutaura zvakawanda kana ari pano.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa zvakanyanya.
But still, it happened.	Asi zvakadaro, zvakaitika.
You are not doing his job well.	Hausi kuita basa rake zvakanaka.
And he did better.	Uye akaita zviri nani.
But this is not the case.	Asi izvi hazvisi izvo.
But more than that.	Asi kupfuura izvi.

I want to know.	Ndiri kuda kuziva.
He can do anything.	Anogona kuita chero chinhu.
We are going home.	Tiri kuenda kumba.

He had to wait until he got close enough.	Aifanira kumirira kusvika asvika pedyo zvakakwana.
He did not want to think about it.	Aisada kufunga nezvazvo.
But it is not fair.	Asi hazvina kunaka.
He could not.	Haana kukwanisa.
But there is no time now.	Asi hapana nguva zvino.
That doesn't matter.	Izvozvo hazvina basa.
And one thing.	Uye chinhu chimwe chete.

He looked, waited.	Akatarisa, akamirira.
You are lucky to have.	Une rombo rakanaka kuwana.
Who needs to know what really happened.	Ndiani anofanira kuziva zvakaitika chaizvo.
Without a house, you know, there is no other way.	Pasina imba, unoziva, hapana imwe nzira.
I have to admit that I am happy with it myself.	Ndinofanira kubvuma kuti ndiri kufara nazvo ini.
She wanted to have a baby.	Aida kuita mwana.
I don't want to try to work for myself.	Handidi kuedza kushanda ini.
But no, that's not easy.	Asi kwete, hazvisi nyore kudaro.

Then the police arrived.	Mapurisa akabva asvika.
That's not fair at all.	Izvozvo hazvina kunaka zvachose.
You do not understand.	Iwe hausi kunzwisisa.
Sure it does, but only a little.	Chokwadi zvinoita, asi zvishoma chete.
And all of this was good and good.	Uye izvi zvose zvakanga zvakanaka uye zvakanaka.
He knew it.	Aiziva zvake.

Everything is empty.	Zvose hazvina chinhu.
You cannot live here alone.	Iwe haugone kugara pano wega.
He knew a lot.	Aiziva zvakawanda.
You are not great.	Iwe hausi mukuru.
No one can be better than he.	Hapana munhu angave ari nani kupfuura iye.

He doesn't think so.	Haafungi kuti ndizvo.
It all happened so fast.	Zvose zvakaitika nokukurumidza.
She was very pretty.	Aive akanaka zvake.
It is taking a lot to buy less and less.	Zviri kutora zvakawanda kutenga zvishoma uye zvishoma.
I am an object not a player.	Ini ndiri chinhu kwete mutambi.
This has not always been the case.	Izvi hazvina kugara zvakadaro.
I never even thought about it.	Handina kana kumbofunga nezvazvo.
It is difficult to understand why.	Zvakaoma kunzwisisa kuti sei.
He tried, anyhow.	Akaedza, zvakadaro.
Well, too.	Zvakanaka, zvakare.
And you can leave at any time.	Uye iwe unogona kubva chero nguva.
Someone in the house.	Mumwe munhu mumba.
Not with him.	Kwete naye.

Again, maybe it is.	Zvakare, pamwe ndizvo.
You have to get out of there.	Unofanira kubva ipapo.
He is not a good man at all.	Haasi munhu akanaka.
He said he should not have known.	Akati aisafanira kuziva.
But he can't.	Asi haakwanisi.
I'm happy with that.	Ndinofara nazvo.
I'm afraid to go.	Ndinotya kuenda.
Not true.	Kwete chokwadi.
He may not have gotten enough sleep.	Anogona kunge asina kurara zvakakwana.
I know, that's right.	Ndinoziva, ndizvo.
You should want to do this.	Unofanira kuda kuita izvi.
Not to mention that.	Kwete kutaura izvozvo.
There is no reason to say.	Hapana chikonzero chekuti.
Hopefully, someone here can help.	Ndinovimba, mumwe munhu pano anogona kubatsira.
He did not want to be alone.	Akanga asingadi kuva oga.
He was small, weak.	Aive mudiki, asina simba.
I didn’t think too much.	Handina kunyanya kufunga.
He was young.	Akanga ari mudiki.

But he was here.	Asi akanga ari pano.
They are going.	Vari kuenda.
I was something else.	Ndakanga ndiri chimwe chinhu.
And since then, he has been better.	Uye kubva ipapo, anga ari nani.
But it seems to be in vain.	Asi zvinoita kunge pasina.
I realized that no one else knew about it, either.	Ndakaona kuti hapana mumwe munhu aiziva nezvazvo, kana.
He doesn't have to be here.	Haafanire kunge ari pano.
It's not the same.	Hazvisi zvimwe chete.
He was alone in the room.	Aive ega mumba.
We didn't care.	Hatina kuita hanya nazvo.
We were unable to request more.	Hatina kukwanisa kukumbira zvimwe.
The answer to that problem.	Mhinduro kune dambudziko.
No worries, though.	Hapana kunetseka, zvakadaro.
She was so beautiful.	Aive akanaka chaizvo.
You have to tell me all about it.	Unofanira kundiudza zvose nezvazvo.

You can do this here.	Unogona kuita izvi pano.
And if any.	Uye kana pane imwe.
And something is happening again.	Uye chimwe chinhu chiri kuitika zvakare.
Maybe there is another way.	Pamwe pane imwe nzira.
I was not happy about that.	Handina kufara nazvo.
And it did not go away.	Uye hazvina kubva.
And he began to study, or to try.	Uye akatanga kudzidza, kana kuedza.
Yesterday he got this.	Nezuro akawana izvi.

There is nothing wrong with that, though.	Hapana chakaipa zvachose, zvakadaro.
But everyone knew what to do.	Asi munhu wese aiziva zvekuita.

Maybe that, or he wanted to know.	Pamwe izvozvo, kana kuti aida kuziva.
A man should not leave any woman.	Munhu haafaniri kurega chero mukadzi.
He lives nearby.	Anogara pedyo.
That doesn't matter.	Izvozvo hazvina basa.
Any or all.	Chero kana zvese.
He is trying to find someone.	Ari kuedza kutsvaga mumwe munhu.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Zvese zvinoita kunge zviri kushanda zvakanaka.

Obviously he didn't want to tell me.	Zviri pachena kuti aisada kundiudza.
Well, that's true.	Zvakanaka, ichokwadi.

He loves his mate.	Anoda mumwe wake.
No one else got one.	Hapana mumwe akawana imwe.
This was very difficult.	Izvi zvakanga zvakaoma zvikuru.
And there is some truth to that.	Uye pane chimwe chokwadi kune izvozvo.
Alone, he knew he had no chance.	Ari oga, aiziva kuti akanga asina mukana.

Talk to me.	Kutaura neni.
This is a good one.	Izvi zvimwe zvakanaka.

The baby is eating.	Mwana ari kudya.
Maybe this is happening right now.	Pamwe zviri kuitika izvozvi.
He was too young.	Akanga ari mudiki zvikuru.
He does not know who or what it is.	Haazivi kuti ndiani kana kuti chii.
He did not do it often.	Haana kuzviita kazhinji.
Well, maybe not really.	Zvakanaka, pamwe kwete chaizvo.
He was not here today.	Anga asipo nhasi.
I really, don’t.	Ini chaizvo, handidi.
There was a boy who had to make a story.	Kune mukomana aifanira kuita nyaya.
I can't stay here with you.	Handigoni kugara pano newe.
I needed food.	Ndaida chikafu.
I felt happy.	Ndakanzwa kufara.
He said he would do that.	Akati aizoita izvozvo.

And there is something else.	Uye pane chimwe chinhu.
But really, you should read this.	Asi chaizvo, unofanira kuverenga izvi.
She sat next to him.	Akagara pedyo naye.
He did not eat enough.	Haana kudya zvakakwana.
As for money we have no problem.	Kana iri mari isu hatina dambudziko.
I don't know whether he slept or not.	Handizivi kuti akarara here kana kuti haana.
That's all tonight.	Ndizvo zvose manheru ano.

Then we have a problem.	Ipapo tine dambudziko.
I didn't want to do it all again.	Handina kuda kuzviita zvese zvakare.
Everything is clear.	Zvese zviri pachena.
He refused to come.	Akaramba kuuya.
To me, of course.	Kwandiri, chokwadi.
Above all, nothing.	Kupfuura zvese izvo, pasina.
For me, it doesn’t come out very well.	Kwandiri, haisi kubuda zvakanyanya.
All of this is not easy.	Zvose izvi hazvisi nyore.
He must be good.	Anofanira kuva akanaka.
He may not want to do it.	Anogona kunge asiri kuda kuzviita.
It doesn't matter now.	Hazvina basa manje.

And no, he never did.	Uye kwete, haana kudaro zvachose.
No one was around.	Hapana aiva pedyo.
My wife, he was the first.	Mukadzi wangu, ndiye akatanga.
He loves to work.	Anofarira kushanda.
No one wants to know.	Hapana anoda kuziva.
You can do it right.	Unogona kuzviita zvakanaka.
He hasn't done anything yet.	Haasati aita chero chinhu.
He is doing just that.	Ari kuita izvozvo chaizvo.
Of course, that did not happen.	Chokwadi, izvozvo hazvina kuitika.
I have no one else.	Ini handina mumwe munhu.
I do not want.	Handidi.
He doesn't care, he doesn't care.	Haana hanya, haana hanya.
Such a little girl, she's beautiful.	Musikana mudiki akadaro, akanaka.

Not that one could sleep.	Kwete kuti munhu aigona kurara.
Usually, for me, only.	Kazhinji, kwandiri, chete.
But far, far away.	Asi kure, kure.
I didn't care.	Ndakanga ndisina hanya nazvo.
I could not do that.	Handina kukwanisa kuita izvozvo.

I was not sure about that.	Ndakanga ndisina chokwadi nazvo.
How easy is that ?.	Zviri nyore sei izvozvo?.

He is doing it all by himself.	Ari kuita zvese ari ega.
I want to see everything going on in the house.	Ndinoda kuona zvese zviri kuitika mumba.
Only you and me.	Ini newe chete.
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.
But they could not.	Asi havana kukwanisa kuzviita.
I can't make a decision right now.	Handikwanise kuita sarudzo izvozvi.
And that is my idea.	Uye ndiyo pfungwa yangu.
And he found out he didn't have a car there.	Uye akaona kuti akanga asina motokari ipapo.
He made a very good decision.	Akaita sarudzo yakanaka kwazvo.
It's hard to imagine it.	Zvakaoma kufunga nezvazvo.
I can't wait to read more from you.	Handisi kumirira kuverenga zvakawanda kubva kwauri.
I do not want to go back, he said.	Handidi kudzokera, akadaro.
He wants to be close to me.	Anoda kuva pedyo neni.
Her children, her husband, her house.	Vana vake, murume wake, imba yake.
Again, it's hard to see why.	Zvakare, zvakaoma kuona kuti sei kwete.
It's very simple.	Zviri nyore chaizvo.
I wanted to believe.	Ndaida kutenda.
I love the truth.	Ndinoda chokwadi.
I know how to swim.	Ndinoziva kushambira.
And me.	Uye neni.
He seemed happy.	Airatidza kufara.
And then he could.	Uye ipapo aigona.
But he does not.	Asi haadi.
We are very happy.	Tiri kufara zvakanyanya.
I did not wait.	Handina kumirira.
Very good, man.	Zvakanaka chaizvo, murume.
But it's hard now.	Asi zvakaoma zvino.
He is looking for a way.	Ari kutsvaga nzira.
I have to read this.	Ndinofanira kuverenga izvi.
He must have been the first to partake.	Anofanira kunge ndiye akatanga kudya.
I have to have it.	Ndinofanira kuva nazvo.
She is not sure.	Haana chokwadi.
I can't get enough of it.	Handikwanisi kuwana zvakakwana nazvo.
I'm not sure he did.	Handina chokwadi kuti akadaro.
And not just for me.	Uye kwete kwandiri chete.
Not only that.	Kwete izvozvo chete.
We all have to go.	Tose tinofanira kuenda.
I know how to do it.	Ndinoziva kuita.
He knew about it.	Aiziva nezvazvo.
And you can't have it.	Uye haugone kuva nazvo.
Not much else is happening.	Hapana zvimwe zvakawanda zviri kuitika.
He is asleep.	Kunge akarara.
Probably not at all.	Pamwe kwete zvachose.
The woman is not down.	Mukadzi haasi pasi.
But we are something else.	Asi isu tiri chimwe chinhu.
Or you.	Kana kuti ndiwe.
There is this.	Pane iyi.
He was a different person.	Aive mumwe munhu.
Well, no.	Zvakanaka, kwete.
Something very simple.	Chinhu chiri nyore kwazvo.
And he is not a child.	Uye haasi mwana.
Need a book so far.	Kuda bhuku kusvika zvino.
Especially not for you.	Kunyanya kwete kwauri.
He seems to be doing very well.	Anenge ari kuita zvakanaka chaizvo.
It must be him.	Anofanira kunge ari iye.
I have no friends here.	Handina shamwari pano.
What you are.	Zvauri.
But it doesn't matter, though.	Asi hazvina basa, zvakadaro.
Or he started.	Kana kuti akatanga.
I hope not.	Ndinovimba hazvisi.
Sit down and be done.	Kugara pasi uye kuitwa.
This is more difficult than it actually is.	Izvi zvakaoma kupfuura zvinoita.
Or to speak.	Kana kutaura.
She is my wife.	Ndiye mukadzi wangu.
Probably he was not there at all.	Pamwe akanga asipo zvachose.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa.
He knew for sure.	Aiziva kuti zvechokwadi.
I'm going home now.	Ndave kudzokera kumba manje.
But you must know this.	Asi unofanira kuziva izvi.
She is eating again and is very happy.	Ari kudya zvakare uye ari kufara zvakanyanya.
There is less.	Pane zvishoma .
And he doesn't want that.	Uye haadi izvozvo.
A carefree boy.	Mukomana asina hanya.
He likes dogs.	Anofarira imbwa.
They did not.	Havana kudaro.
So much is done anyway.	Zvakanyanya kuitwa zvakadaro.
Probably not today.	Zvimwe kwete nhasi.
But again nothing.	Asi zvakare hapana.
He promises to go.	Haadi kuenda.
I was alone.	Ndanga ndiri ndega.
Far closer.	Kure pedyo.
On the spot.	Ipapo ipapo.
He didn't expect the least.	Akanga asina kutarisira zvishoma.
Not there, though.	Kwete ipapo, zvakadaro.
It has to be me.	Ndinofanira kuva ini.
You are very lucky.	Une rombo rakanaka.
You are.	Iwe uri .
Hard to find.	Zvakaoma kuwana.
He did not have that power.	Akanga asina simba racho.
Or who.	Kana kuti ndiani.
She was not a woman.	Akanga asiri mukadzi.
I like this one.	Ndinoda iyi.
Good money.	Mari yakanaka.
You are a person.	Uri munhu.
I'm worried about that.	Ndiri kunetseka nazvo.
But then again, whatever.	Asi zvakare, chero.
It is easy for you to say.	Zviri nyore kwauri kutaura.
That is not an option.	Kuti haisi sarudzo.
But not you either.	Asi kwete iwe zvakare.
We need to see your story.	Tinofanira kuona nyaya yako.
Or start.	Kana kutanga.
We could not return now.	Hatina kukwanisa kudzokera zvino.
We can only leave.	Tinogona chete kubva.
He doesn't know what it is.	Haazivi kuti chii.
She expected him to be.	Aitarisira kuti ndiye.
No, maybe I don't like it here.	Kwete, pamwe handifarire pano.
Not today, and probably not tomorrow either.	Kwete nhasi, uye pamwe kwete mangwana zvakare.
Then the police found out who he was.	Zvino mapurisa akaziva kuti aive ani.
Tomorrow has not yet come.	Mangwana haasati asvika.
You said it doesn't matter.	Wati hazvina basa.
Generally, this is not a problem.	Kazhinji, iyi haisi dambudziko.
He had something.	Aive ane chimwe chinhu.
He was still skeptical.	Akanga achiri asina chokwadi.
Not this time, either.	Kwete nguva ino, kana.
I made it easy.	Ndakaita nyore.
We have a car.	Tine mota.
I saw it all.	Ndakaona zvese.
I hope he doesn't care about it.	Ndinovimba haana basa nazvo.
I wish now, that he would be gone forever.	Ndinoshuva iye zvino, kuti dai aenda zvachose.
We need to think hard.	Tinofanira kufunga zvikuru.
Or he.	Kana kuti iye.
I did the same.	Ndakaita zvimwe chete.
I can't walk.	Handigoni kufamba.
I can plan that.	Ndinogona kuronga izvozvo.
Surely he should have known better.	Chokwadi aifanira kuziva zviri nani.
Of course, that is not the case now.	Chokwadi, handizvo zvino.
No answer, no.	Hapana mhinduro, hapana.
It's very simple.	Zviri nyore chaizvo .
He thought so.	Akafunga kudaro.
He doesn't have to, though.	Haafanire kudaro, zvakadaro.
He just wanted to go home.	Aida kuenda kumba chete.
He knows where my baby is.	Anoziva pane mwana wangu.
Not just for this.	Kwete kune izvi chete.
He lay down on the ground.	Akarara zvake pasi.
That's all today.	Ndizvo chete nhasi.
No one else did.	Hapana mumwe akaita.
I did not return home this morning.	Handina kudzokera kumba mangwanani ano.
Now more than ever.	Iye zvino kupfuura chero imwe nguva.
Or maybe he came again.	Kana kuti zvimwe akauya zvakare.
He needs friends.	Anoda shamwari.
It doesn't matter at all.	Hazvina basa zvachose.
Of course, they are innocent.	Chokwadi, havana kana mhosva.
He did his job.	Akaita basa rake.
It was his good.	Zvakanga zvake zvakanaka.
I know what's going on.	Ndinoziva zviri kuitika.
Nice to be here with me.	Zvakanaka kuva pano neni.
And this.	Zvino izvi.
I knew better than to get out.	Ndaiziva zviri nani pane kubuda.
No it is not.	Kwete haisi.
It was him.	Akanga ari iye.
None of his guilt.	Hapana kana mhosva yake.
You want to try.	Unoda kuedza.
He knew he wasn't long.	Akaziva kuti akanga asina nguva refu.
You can be happy.	Unogona kufara.
I'm feeling better.	Ndiri kunzwa zviri nani.
It's not here.	Haisi pano.
And no advice.	Uye hapana zano.
He had done something.	Akanga aita chimwe chinhu.
That's money.	Ndiyo mari.
Most certainly.	Chokwadi kupfuura zvose.
It was good with him.	Zvakanga zvakanaka naye.
We did not see how anyone could be.	Hatina kuona kuti chero munhu angave sei.
It is very easy to do.	Zviri nyore kwazvo kuita.
I do not want anyone.	Ini handidi munhu.
Not a bad thing to be.	Kwete chinhu rombo kuva.
You can do it easily.	Unogona kuzviita zviri nyore.
You are just a child.	Uri mwana chete.
But then, he must know.	Asi ipapo, anofanira kuziva.
No, not good.	Kwete, kwete kunaka.
I really wanted to know why.	Ndaida chaizvo kuziva kuti sei.
He looks like a good man.	Anoita kunge murume akanaka.
Now we can be happy.	Zvino tinogona kufara.
Maybe someone has children.	Pamwe munhu ane vana.
All of this is uncertain.	Zvose izvi hazvina chokwadi.
I think he is great.	Ndinofunga kuti mukuru.
Sitting, fasting.	Kugara, kufunga.
I think a lot.	Ndinofunga kakawanda.
And it certainly does.	Uye zvechokwadi zvinoita.
I want to go home alone.	Ndinoda kuenda kumba ndega.
I'm better than that.	Ndiri nani pane izvozvo.
He doesn't care, and you don't care.	Haana hanya, uye iwe hauna hanya nazvo.
And that's it.	Uye ndizvo chete.
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.

He did not have time for himself.	Akanga asina nguva yake.
We know, we know, we know.	Tinoziva, tinoziva, tinoziva.
He always is.	Anogara akadaro.
Now, he said.	Zvino, akadaro.
He did not do that.	Haana kuita izvozvo.
I'm sorry and all that.	Ndine urombo uye zvese izvo.
He knew the reason.	Aiziva chikonzero.
It's true for me.	Ichokwadi kwandiri.
Now, there is a problem.	Zvino, kune dambudziko.
Not even thinking.	Kwete kana kufunga.
You have to have it.	Unofanira kuva nazvo.
But you're not my girlfriend.	Asi hausi musikana wangu.
Mumba.	Mumba.
He had no sense.	Akanga asina musoro.
Wonder if he can still see.	Hameno kuti achiri kuona here.
This is not the case here.	Izvi handizvo zviri kuitika pano.
It's hard to see outside.	Zvakaoma kuona kunze.
It's not easy being me.	Hazvisi nyore kuva ini.
He refused to walk.	Akaramba kufamba.
He knew his place.	Aiziva nzvimbo yake.
They're looking for something.	Vari kutsvaga chimwe chinhu.

You can try this.	Unogona kuedza izvi.
We are all working on it.	Isu tose tiri kushanda pamusoro.
And over again.	Uye pamusoro zvakare.
We could not do that.	Hatina kukwanisa kuita izvozvo.
We have no choice today.	Hatina sarudzo nhasi.
But he knows he has a job.	Asi anoziva kuti ane basa racho.
No, very good.	Kwete, zvakanaka kwazvo.
You cannot live here alone.	Iwe haugone kugara pano wega.
And pretty much the outside.	Uye zvakanaka kwazvo kunze.
But you can.	Asi unogona kudaro.
He was a strong man.	Akanga ari murume ane simba.
You are a problem.	Uri dambudziko.
All that.	Zvose izvo.
He was my friend.	Aiva shamwari yangu.
He tried again.	Akaedza zvakare.
Same thing again.	Chinhu chimwe chete zvakare.
He did not know that anyone knew.	Aisaziva kuti pane aiziva.
This is probably better.	Izvi zvimwe zviri nani.
And that's the only finding.	Uye ndizvo chete kuwana.
You know you should.	Unoziva kuti unofanira.
It is difficult to find fault.	Zvakaoma kuwana mhosva.
He did his job.	Akaita basa rake.
I hope he is.	Ndinovimba ari.
I found it easy.	Ndakaona zviri nyore.
I had not.	Ndakanga ndisina.
But we have another option.	Asi tine imwe sarudzo.
She was beautiful then.	Akanga akanaka ipapo.
He's a player.	Iye mutambi.
He tried one.	Akaedza imwe.
Everything is clear.	Zvese zviri pachena.
This is not a good solution anyway.	Iyi haisi mhinduro yakanaka zvakadaro.
And he was very good in the past.	Uye akanga akanaka kwazvo kare.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
But it is no better than nothing.	Asi hazvisi nani zvakanyanya kupfuura hapana.
You want there.	Unoda ikoko.
That's what he wanted.	Ndizvo zvaaida.

I have to talk to him now.	Ndinofanira kutaura naye zvino.
But he realized that he did not need to worry.	Asi akaona kuti aisafanira kunetseka.
We are happy.	Tiri kufara.
Maybe it should be me.	Pamwe ndinofanira kunge ndiri ini.
He hopes it is not the only one.	Anotarisira kuti handizvo chete.
Money is not my issue.	Mari haisi nyaya yangu.
No, of course not.	Kwete, zvakadaro.
Not mine, but yours.	Kwete yangu, asi yako.

I had to take a chance.	Ndaifanira kutora mukana.
And you have to do it.	Uye unofanira kudaro.
I hope you can help and thank you for your time.	Ndinovimba unogona kubatsira uye kutenda nenguva yako.
Good advice.	Zano rakanaka.
You have to go there again and again.	Unofanira kuenda ikoko zvakare uye zvakare.
We could not have done it without you.	Hatina kukwanisa kuzviita pasina iwe.
But, nothing.	Asi, hapana.
He has something.	Ane chinhu.
But he still wants to.	Asi anoda zvakadaro.
It's all happening together.	Zvose zviri kuitika pamwe chete.
No advice from when.	Hapana zano kubva rinhi.
He seems to be asleep.	Anoita kunge akarara.

It doesn't make sense.	Hazvina musoro.
Or a girl.	Kana musikana.

I have a story.	Ndine nyaya.
Well, it's up to you.	Zvakanaka, pane iwe.
You want to go somewhere.	Unoda kuenda kune imwe nzvimbo.
I have done that many times.	Ndakaita izvozvo kakawanda.
But this is not the case.	Asi izvi hazvina kudaro.
But he did not pay attention to it all.	Asi haana kuita hanya nazvo zvose.
More often than not that someone was me.	Kazhinji kazhinji kuti mumwe munhu anga ari ini.
He does not care about us.	Haana basa nesu.

We all know what will happen.	Tose tinoziva zvichaitika.
I can't tell you what to do.	Handikwanise kukuudza zvekuita.
Good thing to see.	Chinhu chakanaka kuona.
Not one.	Hapana kana mumwe chete .
All these things.	Zvese izvi zvinhu.
She is the only one.	Ndiye ega.
No one can live alone.	Hapana munhu anogona kugara ega.
You can't stop.	Iwe haugone kurega.
I'm close to him.	Ndiri pedyo naye.
He would.	Aizoita.
This will happen again.	Izvi zvichaitika zvakare.
You don't have to say anything.	Haufanire kutaura chinhu.
He doesn't know better.	Haazivi zviri nani.
But he can't get out.	Asi haakwanisi kubuda.
He seemed powerless.	Aiita kunge asina kana simba .
You can see well.	Unogona kuona zvakanaka.
I know who she is.	Ndinoziva kuti ndiani.
I can't make this decision for everyone.	Handikwanise kuita sarudzo iyi kune wese munhu.

He has not at all.	Haana zvachose.
I don't care.	Ini handina basa nazvo.
He wanted to talk.	Aida kutaura.
No one is around.	Hapana munhu pedyo.
He knew the reason.	Aiziva chikonzero.
Then his head.	Ipapo musoro wake.
Or love.	Kana kuda.
No, not today.	Kwete, kwete nhasi.
But not with you.	Asi kwete newe.
He was not a friend.	Akanga asiri shamwari.
You should be happy.	Unofanira kufara.
And another man has to do it.	Uye mumwe murume anofanira kuzviita.
He was timeless and easy to work with.	Aive nenguva uye ari nyore kushanda naye.
You are, baby girl.	Iwe ndiwe, mwana musikana.
Probably no one knows why again.	Pamwe hapana anoziva chikonzero nei zvakare.
I'm not sure what.	Handina chokwadi kuti chii.
And to be better.	Uye kuva nani.
You are still alone.	Unenge uchiri wega.
Then the big man.	Ipapo murume mukuru.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo chaizvo.
But he was skeptical, he was skeptical.	Asi akanga asina chokwadi, akanga asina chokwadi.
He is mine.	Iye ari wangu.
Of course he did.	Chokwadi akadaro.

And it's very simple people.	Uye zviri nyore chaizvo vanhu.
There is work and there is man.	Pane basa uye pane munhu.
Just a good story.	Nyaya yakanaka chete.
Same thing here.	Chinhu chimwe chete pano.
I don't know what else.	Handizivi kuti chii chimwe.
They don't care about you, or us.	Havana basa newe, kana nesu.
He knows how to play.	Anoziva kutamba.
The youngest knows the man.	Mudiki anoziva murume.
The house.	Imba yacho .
Something is happening.	Pane chiri kuitika.
But he was good to me.	Asi akanga akanaka kwandiri.
He had come a long way now.	Akanga asvika kure zvino.
That doesn't matter.	Izvo hazvina basa.
He is innocent of any wrongdoing.	Haana mhosva pane zvese izvi.
I wanted the money.	Ndaida mari yacho.
And I am.	Uye ndini.
He had enough.	Akanga ane zvakakwana.
You are young.	Uri mudiki.
I felt the need to be with him near me.	Ndakanzwa kuda kuva naye pedyo neni.
She was worried.	Akanga ava kunetseka.
He has to go.	Anofanira kuenda.
And now he saw that he had gone far away.	Uye zvino akaona kuti akanga aenda kure.
That does not make sense at all.	Izvozvo hazvina musoro zvachose.
Less than one.	Zvishoma pane imwe.
No one else.	Hapana mumwe munhu.
We can see a lot.	Tinogona kuona zvakawanda.
That's all.	Ndizvo zvose.
He knew everything.	Aiziva zvese.
He is a man.	Ndiye munhu.
Haadi.	Haadi.
No money, no friends.	Hapana mari, hapana shamwari.
But there is a way to do that.	Asi pane nzira yekuita izvozvo.
Or talk to him.	Kana kutaura naye.
All on time.	Zvese nenguva.
It's better there.	Zviri nani ikoko.
Indeed, he is.	Zvechokwadi, anofarira.
Now he was alone in the house.	Zvino akanga ava ega mumba.
Tomorrow could be someone else.	Mangwana anogona kunge ari mumwe munhu.
He was home.	Akanga ave kumba.
We have to play.	Tinofanira kutamba.
And of course.	Uye zvechokwadi.
But that is not the case.	Asi hazvina kudaro.
He had to go.	Aifanira kuenda.
And he can do the truth.	Uye anogona kuita chokwadi.
He could do and say whatever he wanted.	Aigona kuita uye kutaura chero zvaaida.
Everyone has something.	Munhu wese ane chimwe chinhu.
I really hope we are.	Ndinovimba zvikuru kuti tiri.
Of course, you can get it.	Chokwadi, unogona kuwana.
I'm leaving.	Ndiri kubuda.

But you must know all of this.	Asi unofanira kuziva zvose izvi.
But we're taking a little bit.	Asi isu tiri kutora zvishoma.
It's hard to do.	Zvakaoma kuita.
No one knew anything.	Hapana aiziva chero chinhu.
He refused to talk to her.	Iye akaramba kutaura naye.
He has a good time.	Ane nguva yakanaka.
Everything was difficult.	Zvose zvakanga zvakaoma.
It's fine.	Zvakanaka.
Work comes quickly.	Basa rinouya nekukurumidza.
He can leave at any time.	Anogona kubva chero nguva.
This is completely absurd.	Izvi hazvina musoro zvachose.
Well, he knows somebody here.	Zvakanaka, anoziva mumwe munhu pano.
He had no time for me.	Akanga asina nguva yangu.
No one came near.	Hapana akauya pedyo.
That's all.	Ndizvo chete.
It is easy to say things like that.	Zviri nyore kutaura zvinhu zvakadaro.
Of course, we have to go now.	Chokwadi, tinofanira kuenda zvino.
I need answers.	Ndinoda mhinduro.
He wanted to eat alone.	Aida kudya ari oga.
He thought he should believe.	Akafunga kuti anofanira kutenda.
It is not without reason.	Hazvisi pasina chikonzero.
Not the police.	Kwete mapurisa.
Or maybe earlier than that.	Kana kuti zvimwe kare kupfuura izvozvo.
I have no reason.	Handina chikonzero.
He was gone now.	Akanga aenda zvino.
Especially not tonight.	Kunyanya kwete manheru ano.
A lot is not better.	Zvakawanda hazvisi nani.

These are good things.	Zvinhu zvakanaka izvozvi.
He looked at everything.	Akatarisa zvese.
He did not, but he agreed.	Haana kudaro, asi akabvuma.
The man looked up, thinking.	Murume akatarisa, aifunga.
Happy with you tonight.	Kufara newe manheru ano.
Everything is very simple.	Zvose zviri nyore kwazvo.
He came empty-handed.	Akauya asina chinhu.
There is no easy choice.	Hapana sarudzo iri nyore.
I can't do it.	Handikwanise kuzviita.
You are not your own house.	Iwe hausi imba yako.
Obviously we have and.	Zviri pachena kuti tine uye .
He needed to find the truth.	Aifanira kuwana chokwadi.
Everyone has a car.	Munhu wese ane mota.
But now he is about to start.	Asi iye zvino ava kuda kutanga.
You need a reason.	Unoda chikonzero.
That doesn't matter.	Izvo hazvina basa.
It doesn't matter.	Haasi iwe.
But this time he was weak.	Asi panguva iyi akanga asina simba.
I wanted to understand.	Ndaida kunzwisisa.
You are a sleeping girl.	Iwe uri musikana akarara.
I'm sure of that.	Ndine chokwadi nazvo.

There is nothing better than that.	Hapana chakanaka kudaro.
Well for nothing.	Zvakanaka pasina.

There is no other time near.	Hapana imwe nguva iri pedyo.
But there is a problem.	Asi pane dambudziko.
But that doesn't matter.	Asi izvozvo hazvina basa.
He thought he was a man.	Aifunga kuti murume.
He made a woman.	Akaita mukadzi.
Then someone asked.	Ipapo mumwe munhu akabvunza.
He was with her here now.	Aive naye pano manje.
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.
I love people and I wish all the best.	Ndinoda vanhu uye ndinoda zvakanaka zvese.
I hope well for all.	Ndinovimba zvakanaka kune vese.
But he does not think so.	Asi haafungi kudaro.
The fact that.	Chokwadi chokuti.

Maybe he didn't know.	Pamwe aisaziva.
Your song.	Imba yako.
He did not sit down.	Haana kugara pasi.
And he really cares about you.	Uye ane hanya newe zvikuru.
But he will be fine.	Asi achange akanaka.
Tom heard in the distance.	Tom akanzwa kure kure.
I love money.	Ndinoda mari.
I didn't have much.	Ndakanga ndisina zvakawanda.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa.
Whether you care or not.	Iwe une hanya kana kuti hauna.
He was gone.	Akanga aenda.
But this is not my story here.	Asi iyi haisi nyaya yangu pano.
Well maybe he was.	Zvakanaka pamwe aive.
Very good !.	Zvakanaka chaizvo!.
He did not want to.	Akanga asingadi.
She was one girl.	Aiva musikana mumwe chete.
He is looking for a wife.	Ari kutsvaga mukadzi.
I do not want children.	Handidi vana.
It's hard to do everything.	Zvakaoma kuita zvese.
But it is true.	Asi ichokwadi.
It's good to be on top.	Zvakanaka kuva pamusoro.
And, not all people.	Uye, handizvo zvese vanhu.
Someone has to see this.	Mumwe munhu anofanira kuona izvi.
You have to accept it.	Unofanira kubvuma.
Now, that doesn't make sense to me.	Zvino, izvi hazvina musoro kwandiri.
He started walking.	Akatanga kufamba.
He did not know who he was.	Haana kuziva kuti ndiani.
I have no friends.	Handina shamwari.
It happened to me.	Zvakaitika kwandiri.
I am you.	Ndini iwe.
No, closer than that.	Kwete, pedyo kupfuura izvozvo.
Seeing my dog.	Kuona imbwa yangu.
Now he must be very sleepy.	Zvino anofanira kunge akarara zvakanyanya.
Now what you are here for.	Zvino zvauri pano.
No one should.	Hapana anofanira.
No one knew where.	Hapana aiziva kuti kupi.
No sense at all.	Hapana pfungwa zvachose.
But in the meantime, it doesn't matter.	Asi panguva ino, hazvina basa.
He just wanted to go home.	Aida kuenda kumba chete.
If it is true.	Kana chiri chokwadi.
More now.	Zvakawanda zvino.
I had not.	Ndanga ndisina.
I have to go now.	Ndinofanira kuenda zvino.

And now it doesn't matter.	Uye zvino hazvina basa.
Love was not there.	Kuda akanga asipo.
Do you have a mind ?.	Une pfungwa here?.
Of course he did not.	Chokwadi haana kutaura.
Someone was here, he said.	Mumwe munhu anga ari pano, akadaro.
You just don't have the time.	Hauna nguva chete.
No baby, you.	Kwete mwana, iwe.
He knows you can't do it.	Anoziva kuti hausi kukwanisa kuzviita.
Lots of options there.	Yakawanda sarudzo ipapo.
Yes, he did.	Chokwadi, akadaro.

Anyone could work.	Chero ani aigona kushanda.
And a good teacher.	Uye mudzidzisi akanaka.
He was not asleep.	Akanga asina kurara.
The evening had to try again.	Manheru aifanira kuedza zvakare.
This is very hard to believe.	Izvi zvakaoma zvikuru kutenda.
No advice.	Kwete zano.
We know that idea.	Tinoziva pfungwa iyoyo.
No child people.	Hapana mwana vanhu.
You can find out more about it here.	Unogona kuziva zvakawanda nezvazvo pano.
He did not get lucky.	Haana kuita rombo rakanaka.
Nothing to do, he thought.	Hapana kuita, akafunga kudaro.
He did not.	Haana kudaro.
It was just fine.	Zvakanga zvakanaka chete.
What are you.	Chii iwe.
If so this time.	Kana zvakadaro nguva ino.
Is there any way to do this?	Pane imwe nzira here yekuita izvi.
I have no choice.	Handina sarudzo.
Especially a child.	Kunyanya mwana.
Probably powerful things.	Pamwe simba zvinhu.
No one could walk.	Hapana aigona kufamba.
Maybe I am.	Pamwe ndini.
But he was too big.	Asi akanga ari mukuru zvikuru.
Better you than I am.	Zviri nani iwe kupfuura ini.

Anyway, it's better.	Zvakadaro, zviri nani.
Not this one.	Kwete iyi.
That's too much for me.	Ndizvo zvakanyanya kwandiri.
Not just a little, but a lot.	Kwete zvishoma chete, asi zvakawanda.
You don't have to be that far away right now.	Haufanire kunge uri kure zvakadaro izvozvi.
One could only hope, and wait.	Munhu aigona chete kutarisira, uye kumirira.
He is a little farther away from me.	Ari kure neni zvishoma.
Maybe this is happening right now.	Pamwe zviri kuitika izvozvi.
It's hard to say right now.	Zvakaoma kutaura izvozvi.
He wants to learn.	Anoda kudzidza.
Good job !.	Rakanaka basa iri!.
He did so again.	Akadaro zvakare.
I thought it was really good.	Ndakafunga kuti zvakanga zvakanaka chaizvo.

Now it's easy.	Iye zvino zviri nyore.

And one, and one.	Uye mumwe, uye mumwe.
Maybe it happened, maybe not.	Pamwe zvakaitika, pamwe kwete.
He did not know if he wanted to know.	Haana kuziva kana aida kuziva.
I plan to do a little more.	Ndiri kuronga kuita zvimwe zvishoma.
We have to go now.	Tinofanira kuenda zvino.
I hope to be here a lot.	Ndinovimba kuva pano zvakanyanya.
Well, anyway.	Zvakanaka, zvakadaro.

I did not say money.	Handina kutaura mari.

And that is what is happening now.	Uye ndizvo zviri kuitika zvino.
No one can know for sure.	Hapana anogona kuziva izvozvo zvechokwadi.
And he is as good as an idiot.	Uye akanaka seasina pfungwa.

See you again.	Kuona zvakare.

It doesn't matter, he said.	Hazvina basa, akadaro.
It doesn't make sense at all.	Hazvina musoro zvachose.
Everyone needs their money.	Munhu wese anoda mari yake.
But it is happening far away.	Asi zviri kuitika kure.
He thought so.	Akafunga kudaro.
I could not be happy.	Handina kukwanisa kufara.

You are still young.	Uchiri mudiki.
He does not have to worry.	Haafanire kunetseka.

He did not go home much.	Haana kuenda kumba zvakanyanya.

And now she is very happy.	Uye zvino ari kufara zvikuru.

Since then everything is working fine.	Kubva ipapo zvinhu zvose zviri kushanda zvakanaka.
He sat still.	Akagara zvakadaro.

I'm not sure at all.	Handina chokwadi zvachose.
Maybe he didn't know who he was.	Pamwe aisaziva kuti aive ani.
He was making a lot of money.	Akanga achiita mari yakawanda.
And she was beautiful.	Zvino akanga akanaka.
I am very lucky.	Ndine rombo rakanaka.
You have to drive.	Unofanira kutyaira.
Not enough money.	Hapana mari yakakwana.
Not everything, though.	Kwete zvese, zvakadaro.
It was hard.	Zvakanga zvakaoma.
That's what you see.	Ndizvo zvauri kuona.
He can't get enough.	Haakwanisi kuwana zvakakwana.

Of course, no one should know.	Chokwadi, hapana anofanira kuziva.
Better than nothing.	Zviri nani pane chinhu.
However he refused.	Zvakadaro akaramba.

And from then on he saw well.	Uye kubva ipapo akaona zvakanaka.
You can't get out of the house.	Iwe haugone kubuda mumba.

Well, you know all about it.	Zvakanaka, iwe unoziva zvese nezvazvo.
And quite enough.	Uye zvakakwana zvakakwana.
He said.	Akadaro.
I know money very well.	Ndinoziva mari zvakanyanya.
It's hard to say.	Zvakaoma kutaura.
Not at all obvious.	Kwete pachena zvachose.
I am the same way.	Ini ndiri nzira imwe chete.
He would not have been able to stay away.	Angadai asina kukwanisa kugara kure.
This is simple, good, perfect.	Izvi zviri nyore, zvakanaka, zvakakwana.
The idea is simple.	Pfungwa yacho iri nyore.
This is very simple.	Izvi zviri nyore kwazvo.
Every doctor has.	Chiremba wese ane.
Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.	Pamwe akadaro, pamwe haana.

Not for you.	Kwete kwauri.
And you need to know the reason.	Uye unofanira kuziva chikonzero.
She was beautiful, almost beautiful.	Aive akanaka, anenge akanaka.
But, he was.	Asi, akanga ari.
Not exactly that often.	Kwete chaizvo kuti kazhinji.

And he is not a good friend at all.	Uye haisi shamwari yakanaka kudaro.
He loved his job.	Aida basa rake.
All for no reason.	Zvose pasina chikonzero.

I'm not going back with you.	Handisi kudzokera newe.
But he had to do this at another time.	Asi aifanira kuita izvi pane imwe nguva.

No one else does that.	Hapana mumwe anoita izvozvo.
But he is not there either.	Asi haasi iye kana ikoko.
He had to do it now.	Aifanira kuzviita zvino.
Well, it could be him.	Zvakanaka, angave ari iye.

Or maybe he wasn't.	Kana kuti zvimwe akanga asiri.
We all have children.	Tese tine vana.
Below is an idea.	Pasi pane pfungwa.
He is near.	Ari pedyo.
And he did not like it.	Uye haana kufara nazvo.

He came to me.	Akauya kwandiri.
But we can do something.	Asi tinogona kuita chimwe chinhu.
He was a great man.	Aive munhu mukuru.

But, this time, he didn't care.	Asi, panguva ino, akanga asina basa nazvo.
Or maybe he had never done that well.	Kana kuti zvimwe akanga asina kumbobvira aita zvakanaka.
That's exactly what you are.	Ndizvo zvauri chaizvo.
Of course, no one blamed him.	Chokwadi, hapana akapa mhosva.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa.

Of course it is.	Chokwadi ndizvo.

And he is.	Uye ari.
There is another option.	Pane imwe sarudzo.
She must have felt happy.	Aifanira kunge akanzwa kufara.
A lot is happening.	Zvakawanda zviri kuitika.
But that is not the case.	Asi handizvo zviri kuitika.

They did not eat.	Havana kudya.

Except for one moment.	Kunze kwenguva imwe chete.
Before he did that.	Asati aita izvozvo.

Obviously this is not the case.	Zviri pachena kuti izvi handizvo.
He wanted to go to school.	Aida kuenda kuchikoro.
It was so.	Zvakanga zvakadaro.
Good baby.	Mwana akanaka.
But you can only plan more.	Asi iwe unogona chete kuronga zvakanyanya.
But nothing.	Asi hapana.
Maybe he didn't understand.	Pamwe haana kunzwisisa.
That's all right.	Zvakanaka chete.
No, it's not fair.	Kwete, hazvina kunaka.
I couldn't say much.	Handina kukwanisa kutaura zvakawanda.
He seemed powerless.	Airatidza kuti haana simba.
It makes a good story, that's all.	Zvinoita nyaya yakanaka, ndizvo chete.
Well, there are a few things.	Zvakanaka, pane zvinhu zvishoma.
He looked like a man.	Aiita kunge munhu.
And it did not go well.	Uye hazvina kufamba zvakanaka.
We need to do more.	Tinofanira kuita zvakawanda.
I had to go back.	Ndaifanira kudzokera.
He certainly did not see the reason.	Chokwadi haana kuona chikonzero.
True, he is powerful.	Chokwadi, ane simba.
At this point he did not even speak.	Panguva iyi akanga asina kana kutaura.
And nothing.	Uye hapana.
Or her husband.	Kana kuti murume wake.
He can't know.	Haakwanisi kuziva.
Great player and great player.	Mutambi mukuru uye mutambi mukuru.

But it did not happen.	Asi hazvina kuitika.
You are not alone my friend.	Hausi wega shamwari yangu.
I know you need a place.	Ndinoziva kuti unoda nzvimbo.
All right, all right.	Zvakanaka, zvakanaka.
But he has a problem.	Asi ane dambudziko.

He was like that.	Akanga akadaro.
But he had no choice.	Asi akanga asina sarudzo.
He tried to think.	Akaedza kufunga.
At that moment he realized.	Panguva iyoyo akaziva.
And for good reason.	Uye pane chikonzero chakanaka kwazvo.
There is nothing to do at all.	Hapana kuita zvachose.
Everyone agreed.	Munhu wese akabvuma.
He had done his job.	Akanga aita basa rake.

Then he thinks of trying and sleeping again.	Ipapo anofunga kuedza uye kurara zvakare.
Well then.	Zvakanaka ipapo.
But they did not.	Asi havana.
He did not want the weak.	Akanga asingadi asina simba.

He was not feeling well, to say the least.	Akanga asiri kunzwa zvakanaka, kutaura zvishoma.
No, not only that.	Kwete, kwete chete.
He asked for time.	Akakumbira nguva.
You have to believe.	Unofanira kutenda.

But he does one thing more than anything else.	Asi anoita chinhu chimwe chete kupfuura zvimwe zvese.
I wanted to eat.	Ndaida kudya.
There is no time to do anything with it.	Hapana nguva yekuita chero chinhu nazvo.
Now things are difficult.	Iye zvino zvinhu zvakaoma.

Many thanks for the help on this.	Kutenda zvikuru rubatsiro pane izvi.
For someone else, he thinks.	Kune mumwe munhu, anofunga.

That's what he wanted to be.	Ndizvo zvaaida kuva.
And of course a lot does.	Uye zvechokwadi zvakawanda zvinoita.

He should rejoice with her.	Anofanira kufara naye.

She will be wearing something from that moment on.	Achange akapfeka chimwe chinhu kubva panguva iyoyo.
Without me, it’s not a big deal.	Pasina ini, haisi nyaya yakawanda.
You’re not very good, either.	Iwe hauna kunyanya kunaka, kana.

Great man.	Murume mukuru.
He did not want to do it.	Akanga asina kuda kuzviita.
I did not want money.	Ndaisada mari.

But then he was not a doctor.	Asi ipapo akanga asiri chiremba.

He could do all kinds of wonderful things.	Aigona kuita zvinhu zvose zvakanaka kwazvo.
But you did not say that.	Asi iwe hauna kutaura izvozvo.
And this place.	Uye iyi nzvimbo.
All of this is not working.	Zvose izvi hazvisi kushanda.
Or he may not have.	Kana kuti angave asina.

No one else seemed to be at home.	Hapana mumwe munhu airatidza kuva pamba.

He could not say why.	Haana kukwanisa kutaura kuti sei.
You are human and young and weak.	Uri munhu uye mudiki uye usina simba.

We have to think.	Tinofanira kufunga.
And he.	Uye iye .

He did not get a job.	Haana kuwana basa.
I can’t stop thinking about it.	Handigoni kurega kufunga nezvazvo.

He did not expect to hear that.	Akanga asina kutarisira kunzwa izvozvo.
Not a good idea.	Kwete pfungwa yakanaka.
They did not say much.	Havana kutaura zvakawanda.
We are all human.	Tese tiri vanhu.
Well with him.	Zvakanaka naye.
We can do it at any time.	Tinogona kuzviita chero nguva.

It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.
She had no husband.	Akanga asina murume.
He began to think.	Akatanga kufunga.
They did not do that.	Havana kuita izvozvo.
Looking forward to seeing more.	Kutarisira kuona zvakawanda.
I did not want to feel so alone.	Ndaisada kunzwa ndiri ndega kudaro.
We are all this time.	Tiri tese nguva ino.
The child wants to win.	Mwana anoda kuhwina.
He was powerful.	Akanga ari simba.
You are not such a person.	Hausi munhu akadaro.
Well, not enough.	Zvakanaka, kwete zvakakwana.
Nothing more, nothing less.	Hapana chimwe, hapana zvishoma.
That was good.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka.

He has to.	Anofanira kudaro.
A man was lying on the ground.	Mumwe murume akanga akarara pasi.
No! 	Kwete!

There is something else.	Pane chimwe chinhu.
That's what he wanted.	Ndizvo zvaaida.
I thought it was a man.	Ndakafunga kuti murume.
Great opportunity.	Mukana mukuru.
No one else wanted to do it.	Hapana mumwe munhu aida kuzviita.
Of course, too.	Ichokwadi, zvakare.

Hameno iwe.	Hameno iwe.

He can't do that, not now.	Haakwanisi kuita izvozvo, kwete iye zvino.
I did not sleep well.	Handina kurara zvakanaka.
It's hard! ' 	Zvakaoma!'
You have to move.	Unofanira kufamba.

No, not the children.	Kwete, kwete vana.
Either way, we have no choice.	Chero nzira, hatina sarudzo.
He was a very nice boy.	Aiva mukomana akanaka chaizvo.
I know how difficult this is.	Ndinoziva kuti izvi zvakaoma sei.
Or do.	Kana kuita.
Or tomorrow morning.	Kana mangwana mangwanani.

Of that we can believe.	Nezvazvo tinogona kutenda.
He wasn't sure he cared.	Akanga asina chokwadi chokuti ane hanya nazvo.
That's my car.	Ndiyo mota yangu.
I'm very sorry.	Ndine urombo chaizvo.

Absolutely happy.	Kufara zvachose.
Man, a good player.	Murume, mutambi akanaka.
You can do it.	Unogona kuzviita.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka kwazvo.
He is a better person than I am.	Iye munhu ari nani kupfuura ini.
But it is not that simple.	Asi hazvisi nyore kudaro.
He should have done so.	Aifanira kunge akadaro.
I thought you knew better than that.	Ndaifunga kuti waiziva zviri nani pane izvozvo.
But first, it is not so.	Asi kutanga, hazvina kudaro.
No, not at all.	Kwete, zvachose.
It was too much.	Zvakanga zvakanyanya.
It is better to talk about it here.	Zviri nani kutaura nezvazvo pano.
But it is very difficult to do.	Asi zvakaoma chaizvo kuita.
That's fast.	Ndizvo nokukurumidza.
I was a good girl.	Ndanga ndiri musikana akanaka.
They don't even care.	Havana kana hanya nazvo.
But we can do it from here.	Asi isu tinogona kuzviita kubva pano.
It doesn't make sense to me.	Hazvina musoro kwandiri.
And it's easy to do.	Uye zviri nyore kuita.

Not everyone has a way of doing this.	Haasi munhu wese ane nzira yekuita izvi.
I have to go.	Ndinofanira kuenda.
No one is sleeping.	Hapana akarara.
Well, you have to stay with you.	Zvakanaka, unofanira kugara newe.
Of course there are good cops.	Chokwadi kune mapurisa akanaka.
Obviously it is difficult.	Zviri pachena kuti zvakaoma.
I live here.	Ndiri kugara pano.
But not for me.	Asi kwete kwandiri.
He doesn't want much.	Haadi zvakawanda.
Why is he not in prison ?.	Sei asiri mujeri?.
She is always beautiful and a very nice girl.	Anogara akanaka uye musikana akanaka chaizvo.
Who knows, man.	Ndiani anoziva, murume.
You are not him.	Iwe hausi iye.
You woman.	Iwe mukadzi.
Well, we have to move now.	Zvakanaka, tinofanira kufamba zvino.
Speaking to speak.	Kutaura kutaura.
He has to work and do the work.	Anofanira kushanda uye anoita basa.
It doesn't matter what.	Hazvina basa kuti chii.
He should have known better, really.	Aifanira kunge aiziva zviri nani, chaizvo.
At this point he is.	Panguva ino ndiye.
This is absurd.	Izvi hazvina musoro.
He has not yet arrived.	Haasati asvika.
A lot of good things.	Zvinhu zvakawanda zvakanaka.
And maybe he can.	Uye pamwe anogona kudaro.
He sat down.	Akagara.
They don't care about it.	Havana basa nazvo.
He saw the truth.	Akaona chokwadi.
I felt very surprised.	Ndakanzwa kushamisika zvikuru.
You must not accept.	Haufanire kubvuma.
It was in the past.	Zvakanga zviri kare.
I don't want to do it at all.	Handisi kuda kuzviita zvachose.
We have to go.	Tinofanira kuenda.
He was still out, then.	Akanga achiri kunze, ipapo.
I have to go back.	Ndinofanira kudzokera.
I can't say what will happen now.	Handikwanisi kutaura zvichaitika iye zvino.
Better than nothing.	Zviri nani pane chinhu.
There are but.	Pane asi.
Once upon a time.	Pane imwe nguva.
And now on to this.	Uye zvino pane izvi.
The answer is simple.	Mhinduro iri nyore nyore.
He usually wants all those things.	Kazhinji anoda zvinhu zvose izvozvo.
Too much to say.	Zvakanyanya kutaura.
He is the one who got the girl.	Ndiye akawana musikana.
He is doing a good job.	Ari kuita basa rakanaka.
We have to do something.	Tinofanira kuita chimwe chinhu.
He refused to go out.	Akaramba kubuda.
He was the job.	Akanga ari basa racho.
He certainly hoped for that.	Zvechokwadi aitarisira kudaro.
Not me, not someone else.	Kwete ini, kwete mumwe munhu.
You love your place.	Unoda nzvimbo yako.
He refused to eat.	Akaramba kudya.
He is not eating.	Haasi kudya.
Maybe not all, but many.	Zvimwe kwete zvese, asi zvakawanda.
This is all good things.	Izvi zvinhu zvose zvakanaka.
I may have another time.	Ndinogona kunge ndine imwe nguva.

Now he knew everything.	Zvino akanga ava kuziva zvose.
This is easy to see.	Izvi zviri nyore kuona.
I really need one.	Ndinoda imwe chaizvo.
I am very lucky.	Ndine rombo rakanaka.
You can do something about it.	Unogona kuita chimwe chinhu nezvazvo.
The baby was him.	Mwana aive iye.
But that is not the case.	Asi hazvina kudaro.
I'll think about it tomorrow.	Ndofunga nezvazvo mangwana.
He knew, and he was not worried.	Aiziva, uye akanga asina kunetseka.
Obviously, this is not good.	Zviri pachena kuti hazvina kunaka.
But you don’t and you can’t.	Asi iwe hauna uye haugone.
He knew her well.	Aiziva zvake chaizvo.
Only me and him.	Iye neni chete.
But now more, more.	Asi iye zvino zvakawanda, zvakawanda.
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.
Here, everything is simple.	Pano, zvinhu zvose zviri nyore.
He seemed to be asleep.	Airatidza kuti akanga akarara.
One on one.	Imwe pane imwe.
And then he had no faith.	Uye ipapo akanga asina kutenda.
I do not know who he is.	Handizivi kuti ndiani.
It is easy to read.	Zviri nyore kuverenga.
You can make friends.	Unogona kuita shamwari.
We can all.	Tose tinogona.
She may feel that all of this has happened to someone else.	Anogona kunzwa sekuti zvese izvi zvakaitika kune mumwe munhu.
For all.	Kune vese.
You can do good things.	Unogona kuita zvinhu zvakanaka.
I think that's fine.	Ndinofunga kuti zvakanaka.
But he certainly did.	Asi zvechokwadi akadaro.
I want to talk to you.	Ndinoda kutaura newe.
No one at that time accepted his advice.	Hapana akabvuma zano rake panguva iyoyo.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
What is .	Chii .
But he went.	Asi akaenda.
But he was mine.	Asi akanga ari wangu.
The younger one still does.	Mudiki achiri kudaro.
I don't mind.	Handina basa nazvo.
You have no sense.	Hauna musoro.
Or you or someone else.	Kana iwe kana mumwe munhu.
I know you are not.	Ndinoziva kuti hausi.
That's enough.	Zvakakwana izvo.
He decided to take what he wanted.	Akafunga kutora zvaaida.
He is talking to us.	Ari kutaura nesu.
Isn't it?	Handizvo here?
He knows the truth.	Anoziva chokwadi.
And he didn't care about it.	Uye haana kuita basa nazvo.
They have no place here.	Havana nzvimbo pano.
I'm glad he's happy.	Ndinofara kuti ari kufara.
You can also say something.	Iwe unogona zvakare kutaura chimwe chinhu.
He was about to go home.	Akanga ava kuenda kumba.
The boy did not even drive.	Mukomana haana kana kutyaira.
Feeling like going.	Kunzwa kuda kuenda.
He wants to get out.	Anoda kubuda.

Male or female.	Murume kana mukadzi.
Maybe he knew.	Pamwe aiziva.
We should be very thankful.	Tinofanira kutenda zvikuru.
He can't walk.	Haakwanisi kufamba.
Good thing to do.	Chinhu chakanaka kuita.
I never thought about it much.	Handina kumbofunga nezvazvo zvakanyanya.
This method is easy to operate.	Iyi nzira iri nyore kushanda.
Certainly is.	Zvechokwadi ndiye.
That’s not good either.	Izvo hazvina kunaka zvakare.
He knew a lot.	Aiziva zvakawanda.
He wants to know something.	Anoda kuziva chimwe chinhu.
To do this.	Kuita izvi.
No one knows where.	Hapana anoziva kupi.
One is much bigger than the other.	Mumwe mukuru zvikuru kupfuura mumwe.
I saw one.	Ndakaona imwe.
We have a lot to do here together.	Tine zvakawanda zvekuita pano tese.
I did not want to be alone.	Ndaisada kuva ndega.
I am not your friend.	Handisi shamwari yako.
And not so good.	Uye kwete akanaka.
It was good, he said.	Zvakanga zvakanaka, akadaro.
We are very lucky.	Isu tine rombo rakanaka.
He really cares about you.	Ane hanya newe zvikuru.
I was right, though.	Ndakanga ndiri chokwadi, zvakadaro.
He is a great man.	Iye munhu mukuru.
And a woman.	Uye mukadzi.
My little one.	Mwana wangu mudiki.
Whatever you are alone.	Chero uri wega.
But he really, really, loved his job.	Asi iye zvechokwadi, zvechokwadi, aida basa rake.

He had to get home.	Aifanira kusvika kumba.
You can expect.	Unogona kutarisira.
But, but, but.	Asi, asi, asi.
I'm going out right now.	Ndiri kubuda izvozvi.
Maybe he shouldn't be here.	Pamwe haafaniri kunge ari pano.
He said well.	Akati zvakanaka.
This is not the answer.	Iyi haisi mhinduro.
I wanted to feel better.	Ndaida kunzwa zviri nani.
This is the nearest place.	Iyi ndiyo nzvimbo iri pedyo.
He was not sure.	Akanga asina chokwadi.
I was out of time.	Ndakanga ndiri kunze kwenguva.
Nothing.	Hapana chete.
He looked down for a long time.	Akatarisa pasi kwenguva refu.
The answer is good.	Mhinduro yacho yakanaka.
Or, not so much.	Kana, kwete zvakanyanya.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.
Now, we all know that story.	Zvino, tose tinoziva nyaya iyoyo.
He was learning something here.	Akanga ari kudzidza chimwe chinhu pano.
But something is working.	Asi chimwe chinhu chiri kushanda.

And very easy again.	Uye zvakare nyore zvakare.
Perfect for nothing.	Zvakakwana pasina chinhu.
If good enough.	Kana kunaka zvakakwana.
The woman was gone.	Mukadzi akanga aenda.
Great man.	Munhu mukuru.
But you can't plan everything.	Asi haugone kuronga zvese.
All or none.	Zvose kana kuti hapana.
Or maybe it is not easy.	Kana kuti zvimwe hazvisi nyore.
The concept is simple and straightforward.	Pfungwa yacho iri nyore uye iri nyore.
He waited in vain and all at once.	Akamirira pasina uye zvose panguva imwe chete.
Now is your time.	Iye zvino ndiyo nguva yako.
Again, we have friends many times.	Zvakare, tine shamwari kakawanda.
I didn't care for it.	Ndakanga ndisina basa nazvo.
May he be better.	Dai ari nani.
Or he may have gone away on his own.	Kana kuti akanga aenda zvake.
But they did not pay attention to it.	Asi havana kuita hanya nazvo.
Common sense.	Zviri pachena.
We are convinced.	Tine chokwadi.
I can't, man.	Handikwanise, murume.
You are still young at this.	Uchiri mudiki pane izvi.
Is that right.	Ndizvo here chaizvo.
He did not say much about it.	Haana kunyanya kutaura nezvazvo.
He looked at the time.	Akatarisa panguva.
It is so hard and difficult.	Zvakaoma uye zvakaoma zvakadaro.
Good for you.	Zvakanaka kwauri.
I think you should go.	Ndinofunga unofanira kuenda.
He was looking away from her anyway.	Akanga akatarisa kure naye zvakadaro.
This is better.	Zviri nani izvi.
He wanted to help.	Aida kubatsira.
He remained alone at home.	Akaramba ari ega pamba.
It's not nice.	Hazvina kunaka.
My money is really good.	Mari yangu yakanaka chaizvo.
You have a little boy.	Une mukomana mudiki.
Not so fast.	Kwete nokukurumidza.
I wanted to sing myself.	Ndaida kuimba ini.
Many things.	Zvinhu zvakawanda.
You can go with us.	Unogona kuenda nesu.
You have to read a book.	Unofanira kuverenga bhuku.
I can't do anything wrong.	Handigoni kuita chinhu chakaipa.
They couldn't do it.	Havana kukwanisa kuzviita.
Homework.	Kushanda pamba zvinhu.
I am very concerned.	Ndine hanya zvikuru.
But this is not easy to do.	Asi izvi hazvisi nyore kuita.
She loves being with him.	Anofarira kuva naye.
I'm sorry, everyone, thought.	Ndine urombo, munhu wese, akafunga.
I really hope this will happen.	Ndinovimba chaizvo kuti izvi zvichaitika.
It was morning.	Akanga ari mangwanani.
You don't have to.	Haufanire kudaro.
I don't know if it is possible.	Handizivi kuti zvinoita here.

But you can say a lot of this to me.	Asi iwe unogona kutaura zvakawanda izvi kwandiri.
But he had no one else.	Asi akanga asina mumwe munhu.
He thought about it.	Akafunga nezvazvo.
He knew he could do this.	Aiziva kuti aigona kuita izvi.
There is no answer from that, baby.	Hapana mhinduro kubva pane izvozvo, mwana.
He did not want to go.	Akanga asingadi kuenda.
We have to.	Tinofanira kudaro.
I'm still here.	Ndichiri pano.

That's all.	Ndizvo zvose.
He is still going.	Achiri kuenda.
But he would not have wanted me to do that.	Asi angadai asina kuda kuti ndiite izvozvo.
Much better choice then.	Zvakawanda zviri nani sarudzo ipapo.
Nothing is moving out.	Hapana chiri kufamba kunze.
Everything is simple.	Zvose zviri nyore.
Any good time.	Chero nguva yakanaka.
He loves such things.	Anoda zvinhu zvakadaro.
Not even learning.	Kwete kana kudzidza.
I don't want that here.	Handidi izvozvo pano.
You have money.	Une mari.
People are coming out.	Vanhu vari kubuda.
Someone very powerful.	Mumwe munhu ane simba zvakanyanya.

He had to do it alone.	Aifanira kuzviita ega.
He refused to go out.	Akaramba kubuda.
It is easy to expect.	Zviri nyore kutarisira.

But, it is not.	Asi, hazvisi.
This is absurd.	Izvi hazvina musoro.

You don't have to.	Haufanire kudaro.
You need that idea.	Unoda pfungwa iyoyo.
There is no help there.	Hapana rubatsiro ipapo.
There is truth there.	Pane chokwadi ipapo.
It’s hard to know the time, though.	Zvakaoma kuziva nguva, zvakadaro.
Not so.	Hazvina kudaro.
I didn't know what to do.	Ndakashaya zvekuita.
We can all tell you a little bit about it.	Tese tinogona kukuudza zvishoma nezvazvo.

Little girl.	Musikana mudiki.
It's hard to do.	Zvakaoma kuita.
Hard, hard, hard.	Zvakaoma, zvakaoma, zvakaoma.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa.

You have to read a book.	Unofanira kuverenga bhuku.
Now he is not sure.	Iye zvino haana chokwadi.
And that we should believe.	Uye kuti tinofanira kutenda.
He must be the only one.	Anofanira kunge ari iye ega.
There are many more.	Kune zvakawanda.

Of course he knew.	Chokwadi aiziva.
He started out reluctantly.	Akatanga asingadi.

He did not understand.	Akanga asina kunzwisisa.
I want to believe that.	Ndinoda kutenda izvozvo.
He looked down again.	Akatarisa pasi zvakare.
I did not like people.	Ndaisada vanhu.
I have the same idea.	Ndine pfungwa imwe chete iyi.
I have nowhere to go.	Hapana kwandiri kuenda.
This is no small feat.	Izvi hazvisi zvishoma.
I really want to do that.	Ndinoda chaizvo kuita izvozvo.
He wanted to be with her again.	Aida kuva naye zvakare.
Someone is guilty of this.	Munhu ane mhosva iyi .

You are innocent.	Hauna mhosva.

Surely there is a better way.	Chokwadi pane imwe nzira iri nani.
He lives here.	Ndiye anogara pano.
I can't do this, he thought.	Handikwanisi kuita izvi, akafunga kudaro.
You knew there was but to come.	Waiziva kuti pane asi kuuya.
But not close.	Asi kwete pedyo.
He was a doctor.	Akanga ari chiremba.

He doesn't know what to do.	Haazivi zvekuita.
Good choice.	Sarudzo yakanaka.
Or a new way.	Kana nzira itsva.

Getting started is good.	Kutanga zvakanaka.

This is taking a long time.	Izvi zviri kutora nguva yakareba.
I love that.	Ndinoda izvozvo.
Someone must be guilty.	Mumwe munhu anofanira kunge ane mhosva.

It is better to wait until he arrives.	Zviri nani kumirira kusvika asvika chaizvo.
And he didn't care about it.	Uye akanga asina basa nazvo.
But we are here again.	Asi tiri pano zvakare.
No cars, no people.	Hapana mota, hapana vanhu.
And all these things are very good.	Uye izvi zvose zvinhu zvakanaka kwazvo.

But he knew.	Asi aiziva.
And all this.	Zvino izvi zvese.
But he certainly had to return.	Asi zvechokwadi aifanira kudzokera.
It doesn't speak, it's true.	Haisi kutaura, ichokwadi.
He is waiting to speak with us.	Akamirira kutaura nesu.
He could not see his story.	Haana kukwanisa kuona nyaya yake.
Maybe he didn't care.	Pamwe akanga asina basa nazvo.
No one knew how to read.	Hapana aiziva kuverenga.
Truly, she was a good woman.	Chokwadi, akanga ari mukadzi akanaka.
I would like a room.	Ndinoda imba.
We should be easy to go, but not easy.	Tinofanira kuva nyore kuenda, asi kwete nyore.

Or maybe it is, but not only that.	Kana kuti pamwe ndizvo, asi kwete izvozvo chete.
Enough said.	Zvakakwana akadaro.
I wanted another good story.	Ndaida imwe nyaya yakanaka.
You do not have to wait for that.	Haufanire kumirira izvozvo.
We need to do better than that.	Tinofanira kuita zviri nani pane izvozvo.
Nothing more, nothing less.	Hapana chimwe, hapana zvishoma .
He did very well.	Akaita zvakanaka chaizvo.
I'm not talking about it at all.	Handisi kutaura nezvazvo zvachose.
They did not speak to me.	Havana kutaura neni.
But for me it works well.	Asi kwandiri zviri kushanda zvakanaka.
I have to do it better.	Ndinofanira kuzviita zviri nani.
You need to stop thinking like that.	Unofanira kurega kufunga zvakanaka kudaro.
Not much, but maybe enough.	Kwete zvakawanda, asi pamwe zvakakwana.
You have to go to school.	Unofanira kuenda kuchikoro.
And this is not good.	Uye izvi hazvina kunaka.
If it is difficult, you may be doing something wrong.	Kana zvakaoma, unogona kunge uri kuita chimwe chinhu chakaipa.
But it did not last long.	Asi hazvina kugara kwenguva refu.
He knows the truth.	Anoziva zvake chokwadi.
You can do many other things.	Unogona kuita zvimwe zvinhu zvakawanda.
There is no other way.	Hapana imwe nzira.
I could be in jail right now.	Ndinogona kunge ndiri mujeri izvozvi.
He was a great player too.	Aive mutambi mukuru zvakare.
But, it is not easy to do.	Asi, hazvisi nyore kuita.
Maybe that will happen.	Pamwe izvozvo zvichaitika.
The story is simple.	Nyaya yacho iri nyore.
He did not find anyone, but he found something.	Haana kuwana munhu, asi akawana chimwe chinhu.
I did not.	Handina kudaro.
Man, woman, woman too.	Murume, mukadzi, mukadzi zvakare.
And that's fine, really.	Uye izvo zvakanaka, chaizvo.
And he had to.	Uye aifanira kudaro.
He should do this several times.	Anofanira kuita izvi kakawanda.
He was not a man.	Akanga asiri munhu.
A boy can do anything.	Mukomana anogona kuita chero chinhu.
I'm not going.	Handisi kuenda.
That did not take long.	Izvozvo hazvina kutora nguva yakareba zvakadaro.
Children, he thinks.	Vana, anofunga.
I want this here.	Ndinoda izvi pano.
He said he heard it all.	Akati akanzwa zvose.
He wanted to go with her.	Aida kufamba naye.

If so, you are not alone.	Kana zvakadaro, hausi wega.
He has one wife.	Ane mukadzi mumwe chete.
Maybe someone.	Pamwe munhu.
We have to go back.	Tinofanira kudzokera.
He is very concerned.	Ane hanya zvikuru.
And he was right.	Uye anga ari chokwadi.
Not that anyway.	Kwete izvozvo zvakadaro.
I am very happy.	Ndiri kufara chaizvo.
He didn't think he could walk faster, or better.	Haana kufunga kuti aigona kufamba nekukurumidza, kana nani.
We have to accept this seriously.	Tinofanira kubvuma izvi zvakanyanya.
He refused to see or talk to her.	Akaramba kuona kana kutaura naye.
He wants to sleep more than anything.	Anoda kurara kupfuura chero chinhu.
I am all of this.	Ndiri zvese izvi.
And not only that.	Uye kwete izvozvo chete.

But no one can do that.	Asi hapana anogona kuita izvozvo.
That's the only truth.	Ndizvo chete chokwadi.
He seemed young again.	Airatidza kuva mudiki zvakare.
He is not the only one.	Haasi chete.
He told me he did.	Akandiudza kuti akadaro.
And he was another great official.	Uye akanga ari mumwe mukuru mukuru.

He knew he had to go.	Akaziva kuti aifanira kuenda.

He did not have to go far.	Aisafanira kusvika kure.
But, he’s a player.	Asi, iye mutambi.
Working your way up.	Kushanda nzira yako.
I thought he should do so.	Ndaifunga kuti aifanira kudaro.
Acting without thinking.	Kuita pasina pfungwa.
You are very close to the truth.	Iwe uri pedyo zvakanyanya kune chokwadi.

And that is not being done.	Uye izvozvo hazvisi kuitwa.

But this was good.	Asi izvi zvakanga zvakanaka.
All right, and now we can do more.	Zvakanaka, uye zvino isu tinogona kuita zvimwe.

That's it .	Ndizvo .

But, it is far beyond that.	Asi, zviri kure kupfuura izvozvo.
He will do well then.	Achaita zvakanaka ipapo.
She was lucky to have him.	Akaita rombo rakanaka kuva naye.

There is no answer.	Hapana mhinduro.

He is guilty or not guilty.	Ane mhosva kana kuti haana mhosva.
Too much fun, too much feeling.	Kunyanya kufara, kunyanya kunzwa.

It is not good to work at night like that.	Hazvina kunaka kushanda manheru kudaro.
I had thought about it for a long time.	Ndakanga ndafunga nezvazvo kwenguva refu.
He could take anything.	Aigona kutora chero chinhu.

At the time he did not want to.	Panguva iyoyo akanga asingadi.

But that did not happen, and no one knows why.	Asi izvozvo hazvina kuitika, uye hapana anoziva chikonzero nei.
He does everything alone.	Anoita zvese ari ega.

He had to go there.	Aifanira kuenda ikoko.
But he got what he wanted.	Asi akawana zvaaida.

You do not have to worry so much.	Haufanire kunetseka zvakanyanya.

And he was lucky.	Uye akaita rombo rakanaka.
And yet he did.	Uye zvakadaro akadaro.
He hoped he could find out.	Aitarisira kuti aigona kuziva.

But that is another story.	Asi ndiyo imwe nyaya.
My husband was gone too.	Murume wangu akanga asipo zvakare.
It's not for somebody else.	Hazvisi kune mumwe munhu.
And he was my friend.	Uye aive shamwari yangu.
This is not good for an adult.	Izvi hazvina kunaka pane mukuru.

You need to plan better.	Unofanira kuronga zviri nani.
You have an idea.	Iwe une pfungwa.

Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.
We don't have it.	Isu hatina.
I really don’t want to be one.	Ini zvechokwadi handidi kuva mumwe.
Someone has to know what happened.	Mumwe munhu anofanira kuziva zvakaitika.
Evidently, he thought that he was doing very well.	Zviri pachena kuti aifunga kuti akanga ari kuita zvakanaka zvikuru.
It is easier said than done.	Zviri nyore kutaura pane kufunga.
He will do well with her.	Achaita zvakanaka naye.
This is better for you.	Izvi ndizvo zviri nani iwe.
You are not alone.	Hausi wega.

And this is it.	Uye izvi ndizvo.
He didn't seem to be coming out.	Aiita kunge asiri kubuda.
To be honest, there is nothing to do.	Kutaura chokwadi, hapana zvekuita.

You can do this easily.	Unogona kuita izvi zviri nyore.
Not just anyone, not anything.	Kwete chero munhu, kwete chero chinhu.

But he has to work alone.	Asi anofanira kushanda ega.
If you are unsure.	Kana usina chokwadi.

He agreed.	Akabvuma kudaro.
He could do that.	Aigona kudaro.
I had to talk to him.	Ndaifanira kutaura naye.
You should have been here.	Waifanira kunge uri pano.

But that did not work.	Asi izvozvo hazvina kushanda.
Sure, really.	Chokwadi, chokwadi.

But he certainly was.	Asi zvechokwadi akanga akadaro.
Nothing fast.	Hapana nekukurumidza.

We could not go far.	Hatina kukwanisa kuenda kure.
You have to understand that.	Unofanira kunzwisisa izvozvo.
You can think a little bit.	Unogona kufunga zvishoma.
He is now at home and is doing well.	Iye zvino ari kumba uye ari kuita zvakanaka.

No one is expecting anything.	Hapana ari kutarisira chimwe chinhu.
He can make good food from anything.	Anogona kuita chikafu chakanaka kubva pane chero chinhu.
Leaving the house.	Kubuda mumba.

Well, we have an idea.	Zvakanaka, tine pfungwa.
He sits down.	Anogara pasi.
He was not a good choice.	Akanga asiri sarudzo yakanaka.
You seem to know a few things.	Unenge uri kuziva zvinhu zvishoma.
I couldn't say much.	Handina kukwanisa kutaura zvakawanda.
That's it too.	Ndizvo zvakare.
That was really good.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka chaizvo.

If the elder agrees that you can go, you should.	Kana mukuru akabvuma kuti unogona kuenda, unofanira.
And he has to come out in the open.	Uye anofanira kubuda pachena.
He thought so.	Akafunga kudaro.

You can stop reading.	Unogona kurega kuverenga.
No one came near.	Hapana akauya pedyo.

She's better.	Anenge ari nani zvake.
And they are at home now.	Uye vari kumba izvozvi.
Now he was skeptical.	Zvino akanga asina chokwadi.

But it did not pass.	Asi hazvina kupfuura.
He was with me anyway.	Aiva neni zvakadaro.
He remained seated.	Akaramba akagara.
He didn't care about it.	Akanga asina basa nazvo.
No one could be.	Hapana aigona kuva.
This has actually happened.	Izvi zvakaitika chaizvo.
We did not understand this.	Hatina kunzwisisa izvi.
We can do it, too.	Tinogona kuzviita, zvakare.
Clearly and openly.	Zviri pachena uye pachena.
We were unable to request more.	Hatina kukwanisa kukumbira zvimwe.
But no worries.	Asi hapana kunetseka.
Obviously, things did not go well for him.	Zviri pachena kuti zvinhu hazvina kufamba zvakanaka.
That's just a good idea.	Ndiyo pfungwa yakanaka chete.
Of course he can't go.	Chokwadi haakwanisi kuenda.
But not from me.	Asi kwete kubva kwandiri.
He had to think a lot.	Aifanira kufunga zvakawanda.

She is doing well.	Ari kuita zvakanaka.
You are certainly not alone.	Iwe zvechokwadi hausi wega.
He was still young at the time.	Akanga achiri mudiki panguva iyoyo.
He's been here before.	Anga ari pano kare.
That's easy.	Ndizvo zviri nyore.
And he wanted to do it now.	Uye aida kuzviita zvino.
There is no certainty.	Hapana chokwadi.
Being close.	Kuva pedyo.
I didn't even talk about it.	Handina kana kutaura nezvazvo.
He does not need one.	Haadi imwe.
He was such a man.	Aiva mumwe akadaro.
Not that he is quitting.	Kwete kuti ari kurega.
Now he was skeptical.	Zvino akanga asina chokwadi.
Not only that.	Kwete chete.
But we are very happy.	Asi isu tiri kufara chaizvo.
I thought he could.	Ndaifunga kuti anogona .
However, often.	Zvakadaro, kazhinji.

And the answer is simple.	Uye mhinduro yacho iri nyore.
But he did not.	Asi haana kudaro.
Nothing to do from it all.	Hapana kuita kubva kune zvese.

And that didn't work.	Uye izvozvo hazvina kushanda.
He felt happy.	Akanzwa kufara.

No one says he wants to.	Hapana anoti anoda kudaro.
But that is exactly what happened.	Asi ndizvo chaizvo zvakaitika.
But that was fine.	Asi izvozvo zvakanga zvakanaka.
He has not made any money today.	Anga asina kuita mari nhasi.
He was simple.	Akanga ari nyore.

A better man.	Murume ari nani.
That is the point.	Ndiyo nyaya yacho.
Not much, but much.	Kwete zvakawanda, asi zvakawanda.
He should not try too hard.	Haafanire kuedza zvakanyanya.
And that is exactly what happened.	Uye ndizvo chaizvo zvakaitika.
I'm guilty, maybe, but not happy.	Ndine mhosva, pamwe, asi kwete kufara.
I can't even tell you how long.	Handikwanise kana kukuudza kuti kusvika rinhi.
No one is saying that.	Hapana ari kutaura izvozvo.
It does not matter.	Hazvina mhosva kunze.
I'm so sorry.	Ndine urombo zvikuru.
He looked at his friend.	Akatarisa shamwari yake.

He’s great.	Iye zvakanyanya.
But then again, maybe not.	Asi zvakare, pamwe hazvisi.

That was difficult to do.	Izvozvo zvakanga zvakaoma kuita.
You're a good boy.	Uri mukomana akanaka.
No one could do anything.	Hapana aigona kuita chinhu.
I felt that now.	Ndakanzwa kuti manje.
And he gave a lot.	Uye akapa zvakawanda.
Now that is difficult.	Zvino izvo zvakaoma.
This is all well and good.	Izvi zvose zvakanaka uye zvakanaka.
And that is exactly what it does.	Uye zvinoita izvozvo chaizvo.
The elder does not have to think.	Mukuru haafaniri kufunga.
That's all.	Ndizvo zvose.
He is coming.	Ari kuuya.
Well, it is not.	Zvakanaka, hazvina kudaro.

They didn't talk about it.	Havana kutaura nezvazvo.
He had to see a doctor.	Aifanira kuona chiremba.
It's hard to believe.	Zvakaoma kutenda.
You agree.	Uri kubvuma.

And he didn't really care about it, to be honest.	Uye haana kunyanya kuita hanya nazvo, kutaura chokwadi.
He was still my friend, he said.	Akanga achiri shamwari yangu, akadaro.
Well that's fine.	Zvakanaka izvo zvakanaka.

But now she feels left out.	Asi iye zvino ava kunzwa asina hanya.
I can do it better here alone.	Ndinogona kuzviita nani pano ndega.
You can't get out right now.	Iwe haugone kubuda izvozvi.
Of course, he has not.	Ichokwadi, haasati.
John thought it was a good idea.	John akafunga iri zano rakanaka.
I can't do any better than that right now.	Handigoni kuita zviri nani kupfuura izvi izvozvi.
I thought maybe there was something you needed.	Ndakafunga kuti pamwe pane zvimwe zvauri kuda.
The woman had to do that.	Mukadzi aifanira kudaro.
He had to go, and fast.	Aifanira kuenda, uye nekukurumidza.
I still love the baby.	Ndichiri kuda mwana.
She has a husband.	Ane murume.

But this time it didn't.	Asi panguva ino hazvina.

That, it is not happening.	Izvozvi, hazvisi kuitika.
And not only that.	Uye handizvo chete.

And that is what is happening.	Uye ndizvo zviri kuitika.
He did not think that he could walk alone.	Haana kufunga kuti aigona kufamba ega.
That's all he wanted.	Ndizvo chete zvaaida.

Asking for money.	Kukumbira mari.

And this is what happened.	Uye izvi zvakaitika.

He was not alone.	Akanga asiri oga.

The answer is simple.	Mhinduro yacho iri nyore.
But still, he came home to me.	Asi zvakadaro, akauya kumba kwandiri.
But he did not have to see it.	Asi aisafanira kuona.

He said he did not think so.	Akati aisafunga kudaro.

To be honest, he didn't see the problem.	Kutaura chokwadi, haana kuona dambudziko.

He must be here.	Anofanira kunge ari pano.
Or something else he wanted to do.	Kana kuti zvimwe zvaaida kuita.
He is very powerful.	Ane simba chaizvo.

He felt happy.	Akanzwa kufara.

But now she is beautiful.	Asi iye zvino akanaka.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Aigona kuita chero zvaaida.

He was not a good man at all.	Akanga asiri murume akanaka.
At this point, he may be right.	Panguva ino, anogona kunge ari chokwadi.
He was a good player so far.	Aive mutambi akanaka kusvika zvino.

And he had no problem.	Uye akanga asina dambudziko.
Not so much.	Kwete zvakanyanya.

Or he could.	Kana kuti aigona .
Everything else here is really good.	Zvimwe zvese pano zvakanaka chaizvo.
He knows! 	Anoziva!

Love, love, love.	Kuda, kuda, kuda.
That's what you're thinking right now.	Ndizvo zvauri kufunga izvozvi.
He did not think so.	Haana kufunga kudaro.
It's so nice to stay here.	Zvakanaka chaizvo kugara pano.
He got it all.	Akawana zvose.
He was not sure at all.	Akanga asina chokwadi zvachose.
It's also simple.	Zviri zvakare nyore.
This is not good at all.	Izvi hazvina kunaka zvachose.
He did not want to do it.	Akanga asina kuda kuzviita.
That was all he needed to hear.	Ndizvo chete zvaaida kunzwa.
All by myself.	Zvese ndega.
He was far from us.	Akanga ari kure nesu.
He did not want to.	Akanga asingadi.
I love that so much.	Ndinoda izvozvo zvakanyanya.
It is not close to the truth.	Haisi pedyo chokwadi.
He is the only one.	Ndiye chete.
I did not know better as a child.	Ndaisaziva zviri nani ndichiri mudiki.
Is that what he wanted.	Ko ndiye aida here.
This was good.	Izvi zvakanga zvakanaka.
Obviously, obviously.	Zviri pachena, zviri pachena.
A little child.	Mwana mudiki.
And he did not.	Uye haana.
I think you have a point there.	Ndinofunga une pfungwa ipapo.
I have nothing !.	Handina chinhu!.
My baby is a good boy.	Mwana wangu akanaka mukomana.
But, it was good.	Asi, zvakanga zvakanaka.
If the child has one.	Kana mwana ane mumwe.
It is not so.	Hazvisi zvakadaro.
I needed to know.	Ndaifanira kuziva.
They are all buying.	Vese vari kutenga.
You know your story.	Unoziva nyaya yako.
You have a problem.	Une dambudziko.
I think this is absurd.	Ndinofunga kuti izvi hazvina musoro.
And that's fine.	Uye zvakanaka.
Maybe I'm not alone.	Zvimwe handisi ndega.
One was a man.	Mumwe akanga ari murume.
I noticed that no one was showing interest.	Ndakaona kuti hapana airatidza zvake.
And then you can do it for me.	Uye ipapo unogona kuzviita kwandiri.
This will happen.	Izvi zvichaitika.
He can sing.	Anogona kuimba.
Mine, and maybe his.	Yangu, uye pamwe yake.

I'm still searching.	Ndichiri kutsvaga.
This place is beautiful.	Nzvimbo iyi yakanaka.

He thought he was alone.	Aifunga kuti akanga ari ega.
Of course we.	Chokwadi isu.
He can tell you that.	Anogona kukuudza izvozvo.

You didn't have all that right.	Wanga usina zvose zvakanaka.
But the truth is not your story.	Asi chokwadi haisi nyaya yako.
He is saying that.	Ari kudaro.
But much more.	Asi zvakawanda zvakadaro.
Handsome boy.	Mukomana akanaka.
Only work.	Basa chete .
Again, there is no answer.	Zvakare, hapana mhinduro.
You have one choice.	Une sarudzo imwe chete.
For me, that didn’t go far enough.	Kwandiri, izvozvo hazvina kusvika kure zvakakwana.
A man can get a job.	Murume anogona kuwana basa.
Well, he thinks.	Zvakanaka, anofunga.
Of course, you can leave at any time.	Zvechokwadi, unogona kubva chero nguva.
Not next week.	Kwete svondo rinouya.
This idea is not new.	Pfungwa iyi haisi itsva.
I have to think, not talk.	Ndinofanira kufunga, kwete kutaura.
They didn't care.	Havana kuita hanya nazvo.
He did not drive too much.	Haana kutyaira zvakanyanya.
It happened many times.	Zvakaitika kakawanda.
She is not a girl.	Haasi musikana.
I guess what it is.	Ndinofunga kuti chii.
I heard about it yesterday.	Ndakanzwa nezvazvo nezuro.
He is learning fast.	Ari kudzidza nekukurumidza.
I was still young then.	Ndakanga ndichiri mudiki ipapo.
There are people.	Kune vanhu.
Not even a man.	Kwete kana murume.
Everyone has something.	Munhu wese ane chinhu.
I had to do it all.	Ndaifanira kuzviita zvose.
He had to get out of there.	Aifanira kubva ipapo.
And he knows how lucky he is.	Uye anoziva kuti ane rombo rakanaka sei.
Maybe a little bit.	Pamwe zvishoma.
And to do this.	Uye kuti aite izvi.
I am innocent.	Ini handina mhosva.
She is fine with me.	Akanaka neni.
He has to.	Anofanira kudaro.
Or mind.	Kana kuti pfungwa.
He did not sleep well, or eat well.	Haana kurara zvakanaka, kana kudya zvakanaka.
He did not understand.	Haana kunzwisisa.
That's exactly right.	Ndizvo chaizvo.
No one felt like coming.	Hapana akanzwa kuda kuuya.
He was well dressed.	Akanga akapfeka zvakanaka zvake.
He did not wait for this moment.	Haana kumirira nguva iyi.
But man! 	Asi murume!
I was not even surprised.	Handina kana kushamisika.
No issues there.	Hapana nyaya ipapo.
But there is only good.	Asi kune zvakanaka chete.
It was good with him.	Zvakanga zvakanaka naye.
And there is no time today.	Uye hapana nguva nhasi.
A childless child had to be.	Mwana asina mwana aifanira kunge ari.
I wanted him to do something on his own.	Ndaida kuti aite chimwe chinhu ega.
Everyone seemed to be right.	Munhu wese aiita sekuti ndizvo chaizvo.
Everything is fine here.	Zvese zvakanaka pano.
This is not fair.	Izvi hazvina kunaka.
No one is good at all.	Hapana munhu akanaka pane zvese.
We are all his children.	Isu tose tiri vana vake.
She is still young.	Achiri mudiki.
He loved her.	Aida iye.
You really need help.	Unoda rubatsiro chaizvo.
He needs to know.	Anofanira kuziva.
That's not fair.	Izvozvo hazvina kunaka.
Great man.	Murume mukuru.
He looked at me.	Akatarisa kwandiri.
Again, good luck.	Zvakare, rombo rakanaka.
I really want to buy one.	Ndinoda chaizvo kutenga imwe.
It's not fair then.	Hazvina kunaka ipapo.
It's still me.	Ndichiri ini.
He has a reason.	Ane chikonzero.
There is no way for you.	Hapana nzira kwauri.
But it's not me.	Asi handisi ini.
But he is still young.	Asi achiri mudiki.
He was hearing these things now.	Akanga ava kunzwa zvinhu izvi zvino.
Or a man.	Kana murume.
She's lucky.	Aita rombo rakanaka.
He seemed to have no idea.	Akaita seasina kumbofunga.
But he said no.	Asi akati kwete.
That is not what happened.	Handizvo zvakaitika.
He must be able to do that.	Anofanira kukwanisa kuita izvozvo.
Now he was skeptical.	Zvino akanga asina chokwadi.
They do not have enough money.	Havana mari yakakwana.
Do you think so? 	Unofunga kudaro here?
she said.	akati.
I am the only one.	Ndini chete.
I had no money.	Ndakanga ndisina mari.
He knows this place.	Anoziva nzvimbo iyi.
We didn't get that much.	Hatina kuwana zvakawanda zvakadaro.
I think so.	Ndinofunga kudaro.
This is very good.	Izvi zvakanaka chaizvo.
He told me another story about it.	Akandiudza imwe nyaya nezvazvo.
He was still a boy.	Akanga achiri mukomana.
It was good, too.	Zvakanga zvakanaka, zvakare.
That is very simple.	Iyoyo iri nyore chaizvo.
Curiosity.	Kuda kuziva.
It doesn't make sense at all.	Hazvina musoro zvachose.
You need a lot of money.	Unoda mari yakawanda.
He did not read.	Haana kuverenga.
We have children.	Tine vana.
Now you know better.	Zvino iwe unoziva zviri nani.
He did not have his own possessions.	Akanga asina zvinhu zvake.
But he knows.	Asi anoziva.
Again, it's not fair.	Zvakare, hazvina kunaka.
But he did not.	Asi haana kudaro.
He did not give up.	Haana kurega.
I can't understand this.	Handikwanise kunzwisisa izvi.
Obviously, it is not good for you.	Zviri pachena kuti hazvina kunaka kwauri.
He is my fault.	Ndiye mhosva yangu.
We are trying to understand.	Tiri kuedza kunzwisisa.
I'm here with you.	Ndiri pano newe.
But now we have to leave.	Asi zvino tinofanira kubva.
I want to get out of all this.	Ndinoda kubva pane zvese izvi.
But we are learning.	Asi tiri kudzidza.
Now he wanted more.	Iye zvino aida zvakawanda.
I want a job.	Ndinoda basa.
You need this.	Unoda izvi.
I have to understand.	Ndinofanira kunzwisisa.
You are not so good.	Hauna kunaka kudaro.
He saw the people.	Akaona vanhu.
Or be.	Kana kuva.
But that is what happened.	Asi ndizvo zvakaitika.
It happened from time to time.	Zvakaitika nguva nenguva.
We can really.	Tinogona chaizvo.
You are not human.	Iwe hausi munhu.
We all have to.	Tose tinofanira.

More on that.	Zvimwe pane izvozvi.
He was everything to me.	Aive zvese kwandiri.
He has to study on his own.	Anofanira kudzidza ari ega.
You may have an issue.	Unogona kunge une nyaya.
It's hard to see.	Zvakaoma kuona.
He was not surprised.	Haana kushamisika.
He looks like a good man.	Anoita kunge murume akanaka.
We are convinced of that.	Tine chokwadi nazvo.
Near nowhere.	Pedyo pasina.
This time he agreed.	Panguva ino akabvuma.
He didn't want that.	Aisada izvozvo.
No speech.	Hapana kutaura.
Of course, he was good.	Chokwadi, akanga akanaka.
Or he is lucky.	Kana kuti ane rombo rakanaka.
That's hard enough.	Izvo zvakaoma zvakakwana.
It is very demanding.	Zvakanyanya kuda simba.
But you.	Asi iwe .
Especially not tonight.	Kunyanya kwete manheru ano.
At first, it was difficult to return to work.	Kutanga, zvakanga zvakaoma kudzokera kubasa.
He was close to me.	Aiva pedyo neni.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Pamwe ndiyo nyaya yacho.
We are moving.	Tiri kufamba.
This, of course, is absurd.	Izvi, zvechokwadi, hazvina musoro.
He was a caring man.	Akanga ari murume ane hanya.
I want to be a woman.	Ndinoda kuva mukadzi.
If he had not.	Kana iye akanga asina.
They didn't agree then, either.	Havana kubvuma ipapo, zvakare.
And food.	Zvino chikafu.
There is no such thing.	Hapana zvakadaro.
And of course.	Uye chokwadi.
I want to play here.	Ndinoda kutamba pano.
Well, not too much for one, though.	Zvakanaka, kwete zvakanyanya kune imwe, zvakadaro.
You have to do better.	Unofanira kuita zviri nani.
I could not get out.	Handina kukwanisa kubuda.
But it did not work.	Asi hazvina kushanda.
He seemed good.	Airatidza kuti akanga akanaka.
I don't think so, though.	Handifungi kudaro, zvakadaro.
He did not want to hear what he had to say.	Aisada kunzwa zvaaida kutaura.
But he wants more.	Asi anoda zvakawanda.
It's not true.	Haisi chokwadi.
Handsome boy.	Mukomana akanaka.
I like this.	Ndinoda izvi.
Not that, not now.	Kwete izvozvo, kwete zvino.
This, he wants to admit.	Izvi, anoda kubvuma.
He did not see or walk.	Haana kuona kana kufamba.
He wanted her to be his own.	Aida kuti ave zvake.
It's hard to stop.	Zvakaoma kurega.
I have to believe we can.	Ndinofanira kutenda kuti tinogona.
It was nice and easy.	Zvakanga zvakanaka uye zviri nyore.
He was about to speak to her immediately.	Akanga ava kuda kutaura naye nokukurumidza.
Want to see that.	Kuda kuona izvozvo.
There is no going back now.	Hapana kudzokera zvino.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hapana chakaipa zvachose.
He wanted to hear more.	Aida kunzwa zvakanyanya.
A lot.	Zvakawanda.
But you can do more with it.	Asi iwe unogona kuita zvakawanda nazvo.
You can always get better.	Unogona kugara uri nani.
I'm not out too much.	handisi kunze zvakanyanya.
Didn't he?	Haana kudaro here.
I want to do more.	Ndiri kuda kuita zvimwe.
He may have done many things.	Pamwe aifanira kunge akaita zvinhu zvakawanda.
He knew a lot.	Aiziva zvakawanda.
It's very simple.	Zviri nyore nyore.
Then that happened.	Ipapo izvozvo zvakaitika.
He had to take his chance.	Aifanira kutora mukana wake.
Nothing, baby.	Hapana chinhu, mwana.
He wants to do good.	Anoda kuita zvakanaka.
It was evening.	Akanga ari manheru.
He was young, handsome and alone.	Aive mudiki, akanaka uye ari ega.
Doesn't matter.	Hazvina basa.
Not much, though.	Kwete zvakawanda, zvakadaro.
And it's easy.	Uye zviri nyore.
He tried to walk.	Akaedza kufamba.
You have to start somewhere.	Unofanira kutanga pane imwe nzvimbo.
He has a lot of time.	Ane nguva yakawanda.
This happened a long time ago.	Izvi zvakaitika kare kare.
To be a better person.	Kuva munhu ari nani.
Is it possible.	Zvinoita here.
I have to.	Ndinofanira .
But this is true.	Asi iyi ichokwadi.
You can walk.	Unogona kufamba.
He wanted to say something and nothing.	Aida kutaura chimwe chinhu uye hapana.
I know, I know.	Ndinoziva, ndinoziva.
Everything is moving.	Zvese zviri kufamba.
The reason is obvious.	Chikonzero chiri pachena.
I think you have a point.	Ndinofunga une pfungwa.
He had no other choice.	Akanga asina imwe sarudzo.
I don't know why exactly.	Handizivi kuti sei chaizvo.
I didn't even eat right then and there.	Handina kana kudya ipapo ipapo.
I am sorry.	Ndine urombo.
He wants to do more.	Anoda kuita zvakawanda.
Everyone is happy.	Munhu wese ari kufara.
But he can't help but want to know a little bit.	Asi haakwanisi kuita asi kuda kuziva zvishoma.
Easy and fast.	Nyore uye nekukurumidza.

You need to know what it is.	Unofanira kuziva kuti chii.
All that.	Zvese izvozvo.
We are not sure about that.	Hatina chokwadi nazvo.
He should have come now.	Aifanira kunge asvika zvino.
No luck at this time.	Hapana rombo rakanaka panguva ino.
I hope obviously.	Ndinovimba zviri pachena.
So what? 	Zvino chii?
He loved everything.	Aida zvose.
But I can't find a way to do that.	Asi handisi kuwana nzira yekuita izvozvo.
Happiness is not.	Kufara handizvo.
You can opt out at any time.	Unogona kubuda chero nguva.
Those things are simple.	Zvinhu izvozvo zviri nyore.
He knew how to do it.	Aiziva kuita.
I think you should.	Ndinofunga unofanira kudaro.
But we know that we can do more.	Asi tinoziva kuti tinogona kuita zvakawanda.
That's hard.	Izvo zvakaoma.

But he was not surprised.	Asi haana kushamisika.
A little, though.	Zvishoma, zvakadaro.
No one came home.	Hapana akauya kumba.
No, no, no.	Hapana, hapana, hapana.
I thought about it long and hard.	Ndakafunga nezvazvo kwenguva refu uye zvakaoma.
But now, it doesn't matter.	Asi zvino, hazvina basa.
At one time or another, no problem.	Pane imwe nguva kana imwe, hapana dambudziko.
No, not really.	Kwete, kwete chaizvo.

That's fine with him.	Izvo zvakanaka naye.

You need to talk to him about it.	Unofanira kutaura naye nezvazvo.

They have no power.	Havana simba.

Wanting to travel, wanting to find a home.	Kuda kufamba, kuda kutsvaga imba.
She is beautiful.	Akanaka.

Everything he wanted.	Zvese zvaaida .
Or, close to him.	Kana kuti, pedyo naye.
He could have refused.	Angadai akaramba.
I didn’t want to expect too much.	Ndaisada kutarisira zvakanyanya.

Above all the reason.	Kupfuura zvese chikonzero.
I needed food.	Ndaida chikafu.
There is nothing good about this.	Hapana chakanaka pane izvi.
That's not fair.	Izvozvo hazvina kunaka.
He doesn't care about all that.	Haana basa nazvo zvese izvozvo.
Without him, he was nothing.	Pasina iye, akanga asiri chinhu.
He denied it.	Akaramba kuti ndizvo.
She is very beautiful.	Akanaka chaizvo.
You are his superior.	Ndiwe mukuru wake.
He, he is not sure.	Iye, haana chokwadi.
Of course.	Chokwadi.
You can make your choice.	Unogona kutora sarudzo yako.
I still have it.	Ndichiri nazvo.
He was one.	Akanga ari mumwe.
He should have thought about it.	Aifanira kunge akafunga nezvazvo.
It happened to me.	Zvakaitika kwandiri.
It's hard to do.	Zvakaoma kuita.
This is a little easier.	Izvi zvishoma zviri nyore.
We didn't care, we didn't care.	Hatina kuita hanya nazvo, hatina kuita hanya nazvo.
No one.	Hapana munhu.
People less.	Vanhu zvishoma.
It was as if he were hers.	Kunge aive wake.
A friend or more friend, he cares.	Shamwari kana kupfuura shamwari, ane hanya.
We are taking this seriously.	Isu tiri kutora izvi zvakanyanya.
But they did not.	Asi chokwadi havana kudaro.
Well, in the morning.	Zvakanaka, mangwanani.
No one cares who he is.	Hapana ane hanya kuti ndiani.
You love a woman.	Unoda mukadzi.

You were home in the evening.	Wanga uri kumba manheru.

But now he did.	Asi zvino akadaro.
I made a lot of money.	Ndakaita mari yakawanda.
Or he should not have.	Kana kuti aisafanira kudaro.
You need to know this.	Unofanira kuziva izvi.

We have a lot of time.	Tine nguva yakawanda.
I'm happy with that.	Ndinofara nazvo.

I don't want another idea.	Handidi imwe pfungwa.
Hard to believe, but true.	Zvakaoma kutenda, asi chokwadi.

This alone is not easy.	Izvi chete hazvisi nyore.
No one told me.	Hapana akandiudza.
She is going to school there.	Ari kuenda kuchikoro ikoko.
He is young.	Ari mudiki.
He thought things through.	Akafunga zvinhu.
That's not what you want to work on this time.	Handizvo zvauri kuda kushanda nguva ino.

And yet we are.	Uye zvakadaro isu tiri.

That is not the answer.	Iyoyo haisi mhinduro.
Now you can find out too.	Iye zvino iwe unogona kuziva zvakare.
There is a reason why it is so.	Pane chikonzero nei zvakadaro.
But maybe this is not the right way.	Asi pamwe iyi haisi nzira yakanaka.
He was still asleep.	Akanga achiri akarara.
But one way.	Asi imwe nzira.
That is not what happened here.	Handizvo zvakaitika pano.
I can tell you it didn't help much.	Ndinogona kukuudza kuti hazvina kubatsira zvakanyanya.
My baby could not get home.	Mwana wangu haana kukwanisa kusvika kumba.
I had no time.	Ndakanga ndisina nguva.
I think that's enough.	Ndinofunga kuti zvakakwana.
I want to say that.	Ndiri kuda kutaura kudaro.

But that did not last.	Asi izvozvo hazvina kugara.
He had not done it.	Akanga asina kuzviita.
You had to say something.	Waifanira kutaura chimwe chinhu.
But this is mostly done for nothing.	Asi izvi zvakanyanya kuita pasina chinhu.
He wanted to be happy.	Aida kufara.
You said you were not sure.	Wati hauna chokwadi.
And he looked down.	Zvino akatarisa pasi.
You have to learn.	Unofanira kudzidza.
He saw in the distance.	Akaona ari kure.
You are not just anyone.	Iwe hausi chero munhu.

He is not the only one speaking.	Haasi iye ega ari kutaura.
But no one did.	Asi hapana akadaro.
He looked surprised.	Airatidza kushamisika.
Hopefully, this does.	Ndinovimba, izvi zvinoita zvakadaro.

I don't want it at all.	Handidi zvachose.
But they did not do that.	Asi havana kuita izvozvo.
Maybe you are.	Pamwe ndiwe.
Not everyone would do that.	Kwete kuti munhu wese aizoita izvozvo.
Of course, it was.	Chokwadi, zvakanga zvakadaro.
Well, that is not true.	Zvakanaka, izvo hazvisi zvechokwadi.

He cannot do it alone.	Haakwanisi kuzviita ega.
Very good.	Zvakanaka chaizvo.

It doesn't make sense.	Hazvina musoro.
Someone has to start.	Mumwe munhu anofanira kutanga.
He certainly did.	Zvechokwadi akadaro.
At home, he closed.	Kumba, akafunga.
He didn't seem to care.	Akaita seasina kana basa nazvo.
Of course he was.	Chokwadi aiva.
From now on, it seems like nothing.	Kubva zvino, zvinoita kunge pasina.
I do not know why and why he does this.	Handizivi kuti sei uye sei anoita izvi.
And this is coming.	Uye izvi zviri kuuya.
Easy going.	Zviri nyore.
The girl is so beautiful.	Musikana akanaka zvakanyanya.
He did well with her.	Akaita zvakanaka naye.
But how difficult.	Asi zvakaoma sei.
You know why.	Unoziva kuti sei zvakadaro.

He was a good dog.	Akanga ari imbwa yakanaka.

He wanted something better.	Aida chimwe chinhu chiri nani.

She is young.	Iye mudiki.
And one boy.	Uye mukomana mumwe chete.
And it is easy to see why.	Uye zviri nyore kunzwisisa chikonzero nei.
He had something.	Akanga ane chimwe chinhu.

Okay, but it's not good.	Zvakanaka, asi hazvina kunaka.

And less on that.	Uye zvishoma pane izvozvo.

He was not a single person.	Akanga asiri munhu mumwe chete.
But I did not find a way to do this.	Asi handina kuwana nzira yekuita izvi.

It was so.	Zvakanga zvakadaro.

He denied this.	Akaramba izvi.
That's all above.	Ndizvo zvose zviri pamusoro.
Everyone had to work, work and work.	Munhu wese aifanira kushanda, kushanda uye kushanda zvimwe.
I don't think you have a story.	Handifungi kuti une nyaya.
He did not try to help.	Haana kuedza kubatsira.
Still, it did not help.	Zvakadaro hazvina kubatsira.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Aisada kutaura nezvazvo.
He was a problem.	Akanga ari dambudziko.
But this is not good.	Asi izvi hazvina kunaka.
You know who he is.	Unoziva kuti ndiani.
And you can be one too.	Uye iwe unogona kuva mumwe zvakare.
But at the same time, the truth is the truth.	Asi panguva imwe chete, chokwadi chiri chokwadi.
He wanted to be alone.	Aida kuva ega.
I'm better.	Ndiri nani.
He is alone anyway.	Ari ega zvakadaro.
I had to go.	Ndaifanira kuenda.
I had to think this.	Ndaifanira kufunga izvi.
We have that.	Tine izvozvo.
I am lucky to be living nearby.	Ndine rombo rakanaka kugara pedyo.
However.	Zvakadaro.
It's too close.	Iri pedyo chaizvo.
The idea is simple enough.	Pfungwa iri nyore zvakakwana.

But the money is not.	Asi mari yacho haisi.
And he did not want to go.	Uye akanga asingadi kuenda.
Often then.	Kazhinji ndiye.
He seemed young and alone.	Airatidza kuva mudiki uye ari ega.
He seemed happy.	Airatidza kufara.
Then everyone left on their own.	Ipapo munhu wese akabva aenda zvake.
Surprisingly, he did not want to be around us.	Hameno kuti aisada kuva pedyo nesu.
Or do you think.	Kana kuti unofunga.
Of course there is no other option.	Chokwadi hapana imwe sarudzo.
He has it all.	Ane zvose.

And maybe good, but just good.	Uye pamwe zvakanaka, asi zvakanaka chete.
Anyway, maybe good.	Zvakadaro, pamwe zvakanaka.

You cannot speak and think at the same time.	Iwe haugone kutaura uye kufunga panguva imwe chete.
And thinking.	Uye kufunga.
He was alone.	Akanga ari ega.
Everyone wanted to have him in the house.	Munhu wese aida kuva naye mumba.
It's not mine.	Haisi yangu.
I don't even want to think about it.	Handidi kana kufunga nezvazvo.
He could have done this yesterday.	Angadai akaita izvi nezuro.
Finding friends, and friends.	Kutsvaga shamwari, uye shamwari.
He alone was.	Iye oga aiva.
I don't think he'll do well there.	Handifungi kuti achaita zvakanaka ikoko.
No one else came.	Hapana mumwe akauya.
They're all the same thing.	Vose chinhu chimwe chete.
Not so much.	Kwete zvakanyanya.
It's simple and good.	Zviri nyore uye zvakanaka.
If he wanted to.	Kana aida.
But it happened again and again.	Asi zvakaitika zvakare uye zvakare.
Especially applicable to everyone.	Kunyanya kushanda kune wese munhu.
That is not what happened.	Handizvo zvakaitika.
Perhaps he was not alone.	Zvimwe akanga asiri iye ega.
That's a better way.	Ndiyo nzira iri nani.
It is very difficult to do.	Zvakaoma chaizvo kuita.
I'm doing it.	Ndiri kuzviita.

The car is coming.	Motokari ndiyo iri kuuya.
He didn't have to.	Aisafanira kudaro.
Most are not.	Zvakawanda hazvina kudaro.
That he would not have helped my wife.	Kuti angadai asina kubatsira mukadzi wangu.
It didn't take much.	Hazvina kutora zvakawanda.
But that is not what happened.	Asi izvozvo handizvo zvakaitika.
I have to walk away.	Ndinofanira kufamba kuenda.
Obviously enough.	Zviri pachena zvakakwana.
And worry, too.	Uye kunetseka, zvakare.

Everything is better.	Zvese zviri nani.
And he has friends.	Uye ane shamwari.

He probably knew, he thought.	Zvimwe aiziva, akafunga kudaro.

Surprisingly, he was left alone.	Hameno kuti akaramba ari ega.
He certainly went a long way.	Zvechokwadi akaenda kure kure.

Of course, that is often the case.	Zvechokwadi, kazhinji ndiyo imwe nzira.
