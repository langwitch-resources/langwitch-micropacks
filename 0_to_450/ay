So it's not really like that.	Ukhamajj janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkiti.
I completely understand.	Nayax taqpach amuyta.
He understood her well.	Jupajj jupar sum amuyäna.
I don’t think that’s a good thing.	Nayatakix ukax janiw askïkiti.
He has her now, he knows it.	Jupax jichhax jupampiw utji, jupax uk yati.
That’s not your case.	Ukax jumanakan janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m sorry for the inconvenience.	Nayax llakistwa.
He had no idea where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk janiw amuykänti.
Don't know what's up with this.	Janiw yatkti kunas aka tuqitxa.
There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.
I’m sorry, but no.	Nayax llakistwa, ukampis janiw.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
New money, of course.	Machaq qullqi, chiqpachansa.
I hope he does.	Jupajj ukham lurani sasaw suytʼaskta.
This or nothing.	Akax jan ukax janiw kunas.
I don't understand that.	Nayajj janiw uk amuykti.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
He was the only one who didn’t.	Jupa sapakiw jan ukham lurkänti.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
You can’t do nothing.	Jumax janiw jan kuns lurañjamäkiti.
That’s a different kind of person.	Ukax yaqha kasta jaqiwa.
I see something in you.	Nayax jumanakan kuns uñjta.
I know that’s it.	Nayax uk yattwa.
It works for me right now.	Jichhax nayatakix wali askiwa.
¡This is it!.	¡Akax ukhamawa!.
And he still did that.	Ukat jupax wali ukham lurawayi.
That is not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He always saw her.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jupar uñjäna.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
That’s how it feels.	Ukhamaw jikxatasi.
He felt comfortable with it.	Jupajj ukanak uñjasajj sumwa jikjjatasïna.
But it really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I am so glad to see you.	Nayajj jumar uñjasajj wal kusista.
So far, it hasn’t been.	Jichhakamax janiw ukhamäkiti.
They are not worth the money.	Jupanakax janiw qullqix askïkiti.
I didn't know all that.	Nayajj janiw taqe ukanak yatkayätti.
I think you understand that.	Nayax amuyta, jumax uka tuqit amuyta.
You’re not like that.	Jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
You didn’t have to do that .	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti .
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
The good and the bad.	Suma ukat jan wali.
He knew the language well.	Jupajj uka aru sum yatïna.
You know that, you know.	Jumax uk yatisktawa.
I mean it’s obvious.	Nayax qhanaw sañ munta.
I’m not sure what to do.	Nayax janiw sasaw sista.
Whatever happens.	Kunas kunas pasani.
He thought he knew that now.	Jichhajj ukham yattwa sasaw amuyäna.
It’s not what you want it to be.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhamäkiti.
I never said that.	Janipuniw ukham siskti.
I don’t have the money right now.	Jichhax janiw qullqix utjkituti.
Now we need to do two things.	Jichhajj pä lurañaw wakisi.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He did pretty much the same thing.	Jupajj niya ukhamarakiw luräna.
I'm not a.	Nayax mä.
He said it very well.	Jupax wali sum säna.
But he doesn't know that.	Ukampis janiw ukanak yatkiti.
That is not the case today.	Jichhürunakanjja janiw ukhamäkiti.
He is not like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
And I can’t do anything about it.	Ukat janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
Not in the slightest.	Janiw mä jukʼa ukhamäkiti.
There was no one there.	Janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw uk luratayna.
It doesn’t matter anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans ukax wakiskiti.
He actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham luräna.
In this case, it is not.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn't do anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurkti.
¡I'm so happy!.	¡Nayax wali askiwa!.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s how things are going.	Ukhamaw kunas pasaski.
I don’t want anyone to see that.	Janiw khitis uk uñjañ munkti.
No one did that for you.	Janiw khitis jumatakix ukham lurkänti.
Maybe not so much, maybe long.	Inas jan sinti, inas jaya tiempo.
He has nothing to do with it.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I mean a lot.	Nayax walpun sañ munta.
Now, that’s not the case.	Jichhax, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t want anything from you.	Nayax janiw jumat sipan kuns munkti.

He’ll do it for you.	Jupaw ukham lurani.
A long one.	Mä jaya.
That’s not a no.	Ukax janiw mä jan ukhamäkiti.
He took care of her.	Jupaw jupar uñjäna.
But no one wanted to see it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uñjañ munkänti.
I’ve done this before.	Nayax nayrax ukham lurawayta.
That’s what you need.	Ukaw jumatakix wakisi.
This has never happened before.	Ukajj janipuniw nayrajj utjkänti.
Today was no different.	Jichhürojj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
You know, always.	Jumax yatisktawa, sapa kutiw.
Money, he says.	Qullqi, sasaw saraki.
Maybe a day or two.	Inas mä uru jan ukajj pä uru.
He doesn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkiti.
I can't have it.	Nayajj janiw utjkaspati.
It’s going to take some time, you know.	Mä juk’a pachaw munasini, jumax yatisktawa.
It’s enough right now.	Jichhakiw ukax wakisi.

Maybe it’s worth doing.	Inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
No, it wasn’t anyone.	Janiwa, khitis ukhamänwa.
He is a much better person than I am.	Jupajj nayat sipansa jukʼamp suma jaqewa.
He is a very happy person.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
He did it alone.	Jupa sapakiw uk luräna.
No one else did it.	Janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyäna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
No, he wasn't like that.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
What is it today.	Kunas jichhürunakanxa.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
I know how to know.	Nayax kunjams yatiñ yatta.
But he knew it wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
This was not the first day.	Ukajj janiw nayrïr urux utjkänti.
I don't know.	Janiw yatkti.
It means more than that.	Ukax juk’amp sañ muni.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He doesn't like me.	Jupajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
I don't want to see it, she said.	Janiw uñjañ munkti, sasaw jupajj säna.
I have seen it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk uñjta.
I actually see him.	Chiqpachansa jupar uñjta.
He is a unique character.	Jupax mä sapa jaqiwa.
You really can’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
But he never did anything.	Ukampis janipuniw kuns lurkänti.
All or nothing.	Taqi kunas jan ukax kunas.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
I’m very very happy.	Nayax wali wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I understand what is going on.	Kunas pasaski uk sum amuyasta.
I know that's a good thing.	Nayajj uk sum yatta.
He is a good guy.	Jupajj suma jaqewa.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nayajj janiw sasaw sista.
That’s saying something.	Ukax mä kuns sañ muni.
He doesn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkiti.
Now he knew about it.	Jichhajj uka toqet sum yatïna.
You are a very nice person.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
I have nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkituti.
But he is not like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to go to school.	Jupax yatiqañ utar sarañ munäna.
It’s better in one way.	Mä tuqitxa juk’amp askiwa.
Everyone has them.	Taqinipuniw ukanak utji.
I told them to.	Nayax jupanakar sista.
But I can’t believe it yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax uk iyaw sañjamäkiti.
But, you know,.	Ukampis, jumax yatisktawa,.
But he didn't say exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum siskänti.

he said, smirking.	sasaw säna.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Tomorrow's going to be a big day.	Qhipürux mä jach'a uruw utjani.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
But, that’s why.	Ukampis, ukat ukatwa.
He knew about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yatïna.
I’m thinking about it.	Nayax amuyta.
That doesn't mean that.	Ukajj janiw ukajj sañ munkiti.
But now he didn't care.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
But somehow he couldn't.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw puedkänti.
He didn't say anything.	Janiw kunas jupajj siskänti.
But he was a little disappointed about it.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa, mä jukʼa llakitaw jikxatasïna.
Me, you know what.	Nayax, jumax yatisktawa.
You need to do this quickly.	Jankʼakiw uk lurañama.
It will last for a year.	Ukax mä maraw utjani.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
He doesn't know any better.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
So it takes time.	Ukhamajj tiempow munasi.
Now he could see it clearly.	Jichhajj uk sum uñjäna.
No one has anything.	Janiw khitis kunas utjkiti.
I don't like it.	Janiw nayajj gustkituti.
I said no, again.	Nayax janiw sasaw sista, wasitat.
He doesn't need to.	Jupajj janiw wakiskiti.
There was really nothing to do at home.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utan utjkänti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I think about that.	Nayax uka tuqit amuyta.
A little.	Mä juk’a.
There is no such thing.	Janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.
Therefore, he did so.	Ukatwa ukham luräna.
He was really alone now.	Chiqpachansa jichhax sapakiw jikxatasïna.
He was discovered yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw jikxatasïna.
He’s a nice guy, a really nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
He had no idea how long.	Jupax janiw qhawqha tiempos uk amuykänti.
It has never happened before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham utjkänti.
I never wanted you, you know.	Janipuniw jumar munkti, jumax yatisktawa.
There wasn't much to do for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkänti.
He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
No.	Janiwa.
You can do things yourself.	Juma pachpaw kunsa lurasma.
It’s really not worth it.	Chiqpachansa janiw askïkiti.
I thought you felt the same way.	Nayajj jumajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta sasaw amuyayäta.
Anything better or my feelings.	Kunas juk’amp askiwa jan ukax nayax kunjams jikxatasi.
I don't do that right now.	Janiw jichhajj ukham lurkti.
Now it was like that.	Jichhajj ukhamänwa.
He was doing well.	Jupajj sumwa luraskäna.
Too far, he thought.	Sinti jaya, sasaw amuyäna.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
I told him so.	Nayajj ukhamwa jupar sista.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
No, it’s not at all.	Janiwa, janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.
It wasn’t necessary, you know.	Janiw wakiskänti, jumax yatisktawa.
But he did not know who had left with him.	Ukampis khitis jupamp sarjjäna uk janiw yatkänti.
You know how serious.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams sinti jach’a.
That happened today.	Jichhürojj ukham pasäna.
It’s not a big deal.	Janiw kuna jach’a lurañas utjkiti.
He didn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
But in that respect.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
There really wasn’t anything else to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw yaqha lurañax utjkänti.
I never knew that.	Janipuniw uk yatkti.
I know something about it, but not enough.	Uka toqet mä jukʼa yattwa, ukampis janiw sum yatta.
But he is like that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamawa.
I don’t know what to do first.	Nayax janiw kuns nayraqat lurañ yatkti.
That doesn't mean it.	Ukajj janiw sañ munkiti.
And that was it.	Ukat ukax ukhamänwa.
But one day it began.	Ukampis mä urux qalltäna.
I’m sure there will be.	Nayax yatxatwa ukax utjani.
You weren’t the only one.	Janiw jumajj ukhamäkänti.
All rights reserved.	Taqi kuna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He walked quickly.	Jupax jank’akiw sarnaqäna.
Maybe he should do that.	Inas jupajj ukham lurañapa.
Not this is the case.	Janiw akax ukhamäkiti.
It is, of course, human.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jaqiwa.
Or he didn't say it.	Jan ukajj janiw siskänti.
But he couldn’t stay at home.	Ukampis janiw utan qhiparañ puedkänti.
And it never happened.	Ukat janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
He wasn’t like he was before that night.	Jupax janiw uka arumax nayrax ukhamäkänti.

He never knew it.	Jupajj janipuniw yatkänti.
We were the ones.	Jiwasajj ukhamänwa.
You should do the same.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw lurañama.

So that's it.	Ukhamajj ukajj.
I really don’t know why.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
No one knew about it.	Janiw khitis uk yatkänti.
But that's the way it is.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamawa.
This is the case.	Akax ukhamawa.
So I didn't know what to do.	Ukhamajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
What's wrong.	Kunas jan wali.
There is nothing you can do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.
But the.	Ukampis uka.

I have done the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw lurawayta.
That didn't mean anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
He didn’t say why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa ukham siskänti.
I wish you could do that every day.	Sapa uru ukham lurasma ukhajja, walpun kusista.
There can be no such thing.	Janiw ukham kunas utjkaspati.
He is both of them.	Panpachaniw jupajj.
That's what he said.	Ukhamaw jupajj säna.
This was obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But now, there is nothing.	Ukampis jichhax, janiw kunas utjkiti.
I mean about me.	Nayax nayat sañ munta.
One man refused.	Mä chachajj janiw munkänti.
There, we are.	Kuna, jiwasax.
It was a little bit like that.	Mä jukʼa ukhamänwa.
I never understood that.	Janipuniw uk amuykayätti.
He had none of that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurañajj utjkänti.
He didn't understand how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uk janiw amuykänti.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Now I’m on my own.	Jichhax naya sapakiw jikxatastxa.

That’s how it still feels to me.	Ukhamaw nayatakix wali jikxatasi.
I never thought the responsibility would fall to me.	Janipuniw uka lurañajj nayaruw purini sasin amuyirïkti.
I don’t know anything like that.	Janiw nayax ukham kuns yatkti.
This one isn’t very good, but it’s better.	Akax janiw sinti askïkiti, ukampis juk’amp askiwa.
He was still in a state of shock.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
He was so depressed that he started drinking heavily.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna, ukat wal umañ qalltäna.
I see myself doing that a lot.	Naya pachpaw ukham walpun luraskta uk uñjta.
I’m in a hurry.	Nayax jank’akiw jikxatastxa.
Not in this case.	Janiw aka tuqitxa.
He’s two people.	Jupax pä jaqiwa.
And that means something.	Ukat ukax kuns sañ muni.
I want some alone time with you.	Nayax jumamp sapak mä juk’a pachaw munta.
But there really is no way to do that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurañax utjkiti.
You guys didn't have that in you.	Jumanakajj janiw ukajj jumanakan utjkänti.
The next night and the next again.	Uka arumax qhipürux ukat qhipürux wasitatwa.

He does this fairly regularly.	Jupax mä juk’a sapa kutiw ukham luraski.

In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
That is what you have to do.	Ukaw jumajj lurañama.
He told me that once.	Jupajj mä kutiw ukham sitäna.

But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
Almost as good.	Niya wali suma.

Not necessary, you know.	Janiw wakiskiti, jumax yatisktawa.
He loves her so much.	Jupajj walpun jupar munasi.

But now he couldn't.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw puedkänti.
But he didn't mean anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
You know that’s exactly what happened.	Jumax yatisktawa ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.

And that doesn’t exist right now.	Ukat ukax janiw jichhax utjkiti.
He didn't want her to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañap munkänti.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.

But it really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
You don’t need that.	Jumax janiw ukax wakiskiti.

That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
I know you know how it is.	Nayax yattwa jumax kunjamsa uk yatta.

But I don't know that.	Ukampis janiw ukham yatkti.
I am not sure about that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
He never wanted to use it again.	Jupajj janiw mayampsa ukanak apnaqañ munkänti.
He just felt like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw jikxatasïna.
But there was nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.

No one else did that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.

Now he knew better.	Jichhajj jupajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.

He had never wanted to do that before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurañ munkänti.

That’s how good he is.	Ukhamaw jupax wali suma.

Or, at least.	Jan ukax, mä juk’a.

But he doesn't want to help them.	Ukampis janiw jupanakar yanaptʼañ munkiti.
I’m thinking about it.	Nayax amuyta.

And it was a very painful experience.	Ukat wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
That’s what it’s about for me.	Ukaw nayatakix uka tuqitxa.
He was in a bad mood.	Jupajj jan wal amuyasïna.
He wanted the house.	Jupajj uka uta munäna.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But there seems to be nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't feel that way.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuyaskänti.

It’s a human being.	Ukax mä jaqiwa.
This is impossible to do.	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
There was a slight stir.	Ukhamaw jikjjatasïna.
Or anywhere else.	Jan ukajj kawkhansa.
He knows that.	Jupajj uk yattwa.
He knows there is no such thing.	Jupajj janiw ukham utjkiti uk sum yati.
I want both of them.	Nayax panpachaniw munta.
He was worried about me.	Jupajj nayat llakitaw jikjjatasïna.

I think you can’t do that.	Nayax amuyta, janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Something needs to be done.	Kunas lurañaw wakisi.
I don't know what to do.	Janiw nayajj kuns yatkti.
But it is not possible to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I doubt it will happen.	Ukajj pasani sasaw pächasta.
He doesn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa yatkiti.
But it is not at all like that.	Ukampis janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't know anything about anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa kunsa yatkiti.
How do you .	Kunjamsa jumax .
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I just can’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatkänti.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
He didn't want to do anything more than that.	Jupajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurañ munkänti.
Both are necessary.	Panpachaniw wakisi.
But it’s not impossible.	Ukampis janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
I think he knows something.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kuns yati.

But he didn't say anything to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitirus kuns siskänti.
He didn't tell them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar siskänti.
But that’s what happened.	Ukampis ukhamarakiw pasäna.
He didn't know how to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ yatkänti.
The whole house.	Taqi uka uta.
I didn't understand this before.	Nayrajj janiw uk amuykayätti.
This one is really interesting.	Akax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He didn't really want it.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun ukanak munkänti.
Nothing here before.	Janiw kunas akan nayrax utjkiti.
I don’t understand how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw amuykti.
That’s how he feels.	Ukhamaw jupax jikxatasi.
It’s going to be a slow motion.	Ukhamaw saraski.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
I didn't know.	Nayajj janiw yatkayätti.
Not so today.	Janiw jichhürunakanx ukhamäkiti.
No, no, no, no.	Janiwa, janiwa, janiwa.
He just realized that.	Jupajj jichhakiw uk amuyäna.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Janiw khitis akan qhiparañ munkiti.
So it doesn't matter.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas wakiskiti.
I know that it was.	Ukhamänwa uk yattwa.
He knew what he had to do.	Jupajj kuns lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
Nothing more can be done.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp lurañax utjkaspati.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
He felt like a different person now.	Jichhajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
I really don’t know what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kun lurañsa yatkti.
Everything is happening.	Taqi kunas pasaski.

He wanted to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa munäna.
No, it’s not necessary.	Janiwa, janiw wakiskiti.
He didn't want one.	Jupajj janiw mä jukʼa munkänti.
Why should he do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañapa.
I didn’t understand them.	Jupanakar janiw sum amuykayätti.
Which he didn't do.	Ukajj janiw jupajj lurkänti.

That made it worse.	Ukaw jukʼamp jan walinak luräna.
I’m so happy for you.	Nayax jumatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
You can’t do that.	Janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
He definitely has something to do.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw kuna lurañas utji.
He never refused anyone.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus jan munkänti.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sum yatta.

There was no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
I just wanted to say that.	Nayax ukhamakiw sañ munta.
The guy knows what he is doing.	Uka waynax kuntï luraski uk sum yati.
He knew nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkänti.
There is good reason why this happened.	Ukajj kunatsa ukham pasäna ukajj wali askiwa.
I thought you felt the same way.	Nayajj jumajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta sasaw amuyayäta.
And he was alone.	Ukat jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna.
He didn’t think so.	Janiw ukham amuykänti.
And for all the reasons.	Ukat taqi kunatsa ukham lurañax wakisispa.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
The sooner you do that, the better.	Ukham jankʼak lurasma ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
It was something we did.	Ukajj mä kuntï lurapkta ukhamänwa.
I know too much about it.	Nayax sinti yattwa.
He went through it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uka toqet sarjjäna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
We are not the same.	Janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkiti.
I really want to do that.	Chiqpachansa uk lurañwa munta.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Janiw khitimpis parltʼañ munkänti.
You know that, you know.	Jumax uk yatisktawa.
But it’s almost like that.	Ukampis niya ukhamakiw.
What do you think will happen?.	¿Kunas utjani sasin amuyta?.
He said there was no one in the house.	Utan janiw khitis utjkiti sasaw säna.
It was like that one day.	Mä urux ukhamänwa.
No one knew what he was doing there alone.	Kuntï ukan sapaki lurkäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I’m feeling pretty good.	Nayax wali sum jikxatastxa.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it never happens.	Ukampis janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
It certainly was for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix ukhamänwa.
I’d say the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw sañ munta.
He did it, you know.	Jupaw uk luräna, jumax yatisktawa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He was right about that.	Jupajj uka toqet cheqapuniw säna.
He couldn't do it now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj uk lurañ puedkänti.
But I still feel better.	Ukampis wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
I want to tell you about it.	Nayax uka tuqit yatiyañ munta.
He seemed to be a nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

And that’s what it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamawa.
It’s really good for you.	Chiqpachansa jumatakix wali askiwa.

But he knew it all too well.	Ukampis jupajj uk sum yatïna.
I know how to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ yatta.
In fact, it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
He couldn't do it much longer.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj uk lurañ puedkänti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
There is no way to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax utjkiti.
I wanted to do that.	Nayajj ukham lurañwa munta.
He did nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kuns lurkänti.
But I didn’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkti.
I didn't want that.	Nayajj janiw uk munkayätti.

I never knew anything.	Janipuniw kunsa yatkayätti.
I didn't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurañ munkayätti.
He said he didn’t know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk yatkti sasaw säna.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
And that was the case.	Ukat uka tuqitxa ukhamarakiw pasäna.
I’m feeling sad.	Nayax llakitaw jikxatastxa.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Nayax janiw kunjams uk lurañ yatkayätti.
You’re not the one.	Janiw jumajj ukhamäkiti.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
He can do it two, three years.	Jupax pä, kimsa maraw luraspa.
I have these things.	Nayax ukanak utjitu.
They can’t do it.	Jupanakax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't say anything to me.	Jupajj janiw nayarojj kuns siskänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
The same day.	Uka pachpa uru.
But he never said that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kunapachas uk siskänti.
That’s exactly what happens.	Ukax chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
A terrible time.	Mä jan wali tiempo.
He didn’t want to tell anyone.	Janiw khitirus yatiyañ munkänti.
Maybe we’re the ones.	Inas jiwasax.
But that doesn't mean anything.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
But it’s not like that for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
I don’t know how to do that.	Nayax janiw kunjams ukham lurañax uk yatkti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But now there was nothing to do.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
I don't want to talk about it.	Janiw uka toqet parlañ munkti.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he wanted nothing more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkänti.
He wants to be nice to me, he wants to be nice to you.	Jupax nayamp sum sañ muni, jupax jumamp sum sañ muni.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I really wanted nothing more.	Chiqpachansa janiw jukʼamp kuns munkayätti.

No one really wants to do that.	Janiw khitis chiqpachansa ukham lurañ munkiti.

But no one understood.	Ukampis janiw khitis amuykänti.
There is nothing to do, nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

That’s what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj munäna.

I think that’s a good thing.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.

And it worked for me.	Ukat nayatakix wali askiwa.
It took him a moment to realize what.	Mä jukʼa tiempow kunas uk amuyasïna.

He told me that privately, of course.	Jupax sapakiw uk sitäna, chiqpachansa.
He didn't have anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
And he was very upset.	Ukat jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I really don’t have that much money.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham qullqix utjkituti.
He said he doesn’t remember much of that night.	Uka arumax janiw sinti amtaskti sasaw säna.

Or it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.

And he is going to do bad things.	Ukat jupax jan walinak lurañwa saraski.
And at least not.	Ukat mä jukʼa janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
You just can’t do it.	Jumax ukhamakiw lurasma.
You certainly were.	Chiqpachansa jumax ukhamänwa.
And I was no different.	Ukat nayajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.

He wanted nothing more.	Jupajj janiw kunas ukat jukʼamp munkänti.
He didn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.
He said he didn't see what he was doing.	Kuntï luraskta uk janiw uñjkti sasaw säna.
There was nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkänti.
And that’s good for you.	Ukat ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.

I didn’t know anything.	Janiw kuns yatkayätti.
This is definitely not good for you.	Akax chiqpachansa janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
I don’t know how you did it.	Janiw kunjamatsa uk lurapkta uk yatkti.

He feels very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasi.
But he didn't know that.	Ukampis janiw uk yatkänti.
I’ve done this twice.	Nayax pä kutiw uk lurawayta.
That’s what the guy is doing here.	Ukhamaw uka waynax akan luraski.

So it's not a good thing.	Ukhamajj janiw askïkiti.
I don't know how to handle it.	Janiw kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ yatkti.
He is feeling better now.	Jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasi.

And that’s exactly what happened.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.

He did it for the guy.	Jupajj uk luräna.
He never did that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
I’ve actually done that.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukham lurawayta.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
So he said that.	Ukatwa jupajj uk säna.
He is doing it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luraski.
He didn’t know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk yatkänti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He seemed to be someone else.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He wanted a house.	Jupajj mä uta munäna.
I am saddened by the results.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk uñjasajj llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I don’t want to tell you about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit yatiyañ munkti.
And the worst kind.	Ukat jukʼamp jan wali kasta.
I agree with you on that.	Nayax jumamp chikaw uka tuqitxa.
Something feels like that.	Kunas ukham amuyasi.
That is not necessary now.	Jichhajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He was the one who knew it.	Jupaw uk yatïna.
But no one thought so.	Ukampis janiw khitis ukham amuykänti.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sum yatta.
I didn't really want anything.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun kuns munkayätti.

I still feel strongly about it.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw uka tuqitx jikxatastxa.

I have said this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham sista.
Everyone has to do it.	Taqinipuniw lurañapa.
He never did anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns lurkänti.

But he did just that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham luräna.
That didn't do it for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj lurkänti.
He did his job.	Jupaw lurañap luräna.
I highly doubt that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun pächasta.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I thought there was something.	Kunas utji sasaw amuyayäta.
Another way, too.	Yaqha tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
Not that I wanted to do nothing about it.	Janiw uka toqet jan kun lurañ munkayätti.
But he’s not like that, either.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, ukhamaraki.
He had been gone for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan sarjjäna.
That wasn’t there.	Ukax janiw utjkänti.
He really took good care of her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar sum uñjäna.
So it never happens.	Ukhamajj janiw kunapachas ukhamäkiti.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don't believe that.	Nayajj janiw uk creykti.
He had never done this before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurkänti.

There’s nothing there.	Janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
There was nothing like it .	Janiw kunas ukham utjkänti .
He’ll do it for you.	Jupaw uk lurani.
I’ve done this twice before.	Nayax pä kutiw nayrax ukham lurawayta.
I’m sure you’re right.	Nayax yatxatwa.
But something happened.	Ukampis kunas pasäna.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He says why.	Jupax kunatsa sasaw saraki.
That wasn't there.	Ukajj janiw utjkänti.

You’re an adult.	Jumax jilïr jaqiwa.
And you like the way it feels.	Ukat kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk jumajj wal gusti.
He didn't know why.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa ukham siskäna uk yatkänti.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
Why is it so? 	¿Kunatsa?
And it all happened so fast.	Ukat taqi kunas wali jankʼakiw pasäna.

It wasn’t necessary.	Janiw ukax wakiskänti.

That’s what he’s doing.	Ukhamaw jupax luraski.

He was very excited about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
And so it is .	Ukat ukhamarakiw uka .
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He knew that for a long time.	Ukajj wali jaya tiempow uk yatïna.

I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I don't know much about it.	Janiw uka toqet wal yatkti.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
It will do the same thing.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw lurani.
If anyone knew less than I did, he knew better.	Khitis nayat jukʼamp jan yatkaspa ukhajja, jukʼamp sumwa yatïna.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
There really is nothing for me.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas nayatakix utjkiti.

He decided to do it in two ways.	Jupax pä tuqit lurañ amtäna.
In this case, it is not.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
But he knew what he had to do.	Ukampis kun lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
That's not what I said.	Ukajj janiw nayajj siskänti.

But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he will do it.	Ukat jupax uk lurani.

He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.

But he did it.	Ukampis uk luräna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

He was so happy that he couldn't do it.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, janiw ukanak lurañ puedkänti.
You don't need that time.	Janiw uka tiempojj wakiskiti.
I really didn’t want to use it.	Chiqpachansa janiw apnaqañ munkayätti.

Not really, no.	Janiw chiqpachansa, janiwa.
I don't know how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatkti.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.

He decided that was the way to go.	Jupajj ukham lurañaw wakisi sasaw amtäna.

But it didn’t feel that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuyaskänti.

He didn't understand her.	Jupajj janiw jupar amuykänti.
Or so he said.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa säna.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.

There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He was careful, he thought.	Jupax wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna, sasaw amuyäna.
This was not something he fully understood.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï jupajj sum amuykänti.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have done this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham lurawayta.

And it actually has for a while.	Ukat chiqpachansa mä jukʼa tiempow ukham lurawayi.
You repeat it once, twice.	Jumax mä kuti, pä kutiw wasitat lurasma.

He was a little lonely.	Jupax mä juk’a sapakiw jikxatasïna.
And a little .	Ukat mä jukʼa .
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.

¡Everything is good!.	¡Taqi kunas wali askiwa!.

He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And in that respect.	Ukat uka tuqitxa.
They like that a lot.	Jupanakajj ukham wal gusti.
But everything else, too.	Ukampis taqi kunas, ukhamaraki.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.
He thought she wanted him the way he did.	Jupajj kunjamtï jupajj lurkäna ukhamwa jupajj munäna sasaw amuyäna.
But he did it himself.	Ukampis jupaw uk luräna.
He didn’t know when it was necessary.	Kunapachas wakisi uk janiw yatkänti.
He certainly didn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkänti.

But he didn't understand why this happened.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw amuykänti.
He knew the language.	Jupajj uka aru yatïna.
He didn't want her.	Jupajj janiw jupar munkänti.
He knew what that felt like.	Kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasïna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
There is nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañax utjkiti.

But somehow he wasn't sure.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jupajj jan sum yatkänti.
No one did anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkänti.

And it sort of happened.	Ukat mä jukʼa ukham pasäna.
This is mine however.	Akax nayan ukampis.

I didn't want to do that now.	Jichhajj janiw uk lurañ munkayätti.

He can really do anything.	Jupajj cheqapuniw kuns luraspa.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.

It all happened so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jankʼakiw pasäna.

He knew how to do that.	Jupajj kunjamsa ukham lurañ yatïna.
He moved very quickly.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he left the country.	Ukampis uka markat sarjjäna.
He knew about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yatïna.
And where is it located.	Ukat kawkhansa utji.
Or so I thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyayäta.

And it wasn’t like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkänti.
It's going to be a great day.	Mä jach'a uruw utjani.

But that was rare.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti utjkänti.

Or, somehow, it felt like one.	Jan ukajj, kunjamatsa, mä ukham amuyasïna.
There is nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañax utjkiti.
That’s even better.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa.

He’s a very bad guy.	Jupax wali jan wali jaqiwa.

And he’s the one.	Ukat jupax.

Also, you know what.	Ukhamaraki, jumax yatisktawa.
These are the things he knew.	Ukanak yatïna.

It can’t be done properly.	Janiw sum lurañjamäkiti.

He loved it so much.	Jupajj wal munäna.
He’s just like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw.

You have to do both.	Panpachaniw lurañama.

That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he did just that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham luräna.
He has to do it all himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe ukanak lurañapa.
That's not what I want.	Ukajj janiw nayajj munkti.

What is it supposed to do.	¿Kunsa ukajj lurañapa.
There’s really nothing you can do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He was the first to see it.	Jupaw nayrïr kuti uñjäna.

He did a very good job.	Jupajj wali sumwa luräna.

He was very happy to go.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw saräna.
But he already knew.	Ukampis jupajj niyaw yatïna.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
That’s not good for anyone.	Ukax janiw khitirus askïkiti.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
Once, twice, three times.	Mä kuti, pä kuti, kimsa kuti.
Therefore, he said.	Ukatwa ukham säna.
I’m really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
That night.	Uka arumax.
No one really knows what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatkiti.
I don’t mean that, I mean this.	Nayax janiw ukax sañ munkti, aka sañ muni.
But there was nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañas utjkänti.
But he didn't want to talk to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitimpis parlañ wal munkänti.
It wasn’t.	Ukhamänwa.
What made it so.	Kunas ukham luräna.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk wal munäna.
He obviously enjoyed it.	Jupajj ukajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
It doesn’t really mean it doesn’t.	Janiwa chiqpachansa janiwa sañ munkiti.
But he has done just that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamarakiw lurawayi.
There is no such thing.	Janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.
He doesn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa lurañ munkiti.
So I'm still very happy.	Ukhamajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
That's what you get.	Ukaw jumajj jikjjatasta.
He didn’t know anything.	Jupax janiw kuns yatkänti.

He didn't know why he would do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurani uk janiw yatkänti.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He found out today.	Jupax jichhüruw jikxatasïna.
Now he knew why.	Jichhajj kunatsa uk yatïna.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He understood that.	Jupajj uk amuyäna.
He decided to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañsa amtäna.
I guess he didn’t know any better.	Nayax amuyta, jupax janiw juk’amp sum yatkänti.

You know how it goes.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaski uk jumajj yatisktawa.
Or so it seems.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyasi.

He didn't understand anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns amuykänti.
I didn’t want to go.	Janiw sarañ munkayätti.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañax utjkaspati.
Maybe he needs to go to one.	Inas jupax mä ukar sarañax wakischispa.
This guy didn’t know anything.	Aka waynax janiw kuns yatkänti.
I don’t think he knows.	Nayax janiw jupax yatkaspa ukham amuyta.
But that’s good for you.	Ukampis ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
No one was saying that.	Janiw khitis ukham siskänti.

He understood it perfectly well.	Jupajj sumwa uk sum amuyäna.

It just happened to happen.	Ukajj ukhamakiw pasäna.
I don’t remember anything else.	Janiw kunas yaqha tuqit amtaskti.
He seemed to be a nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

I’ve seen three of them.	Nayax kimsa ukham uñjta.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
It happened the same day.	Uka pachpa uruw ukax pasäna.
But it doesn’t mean anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
He was very well unsure about it.	Jupajj wali sumwa uka toqet jan sum yatkänti.
I don’t think that’s it.	Janiw nayax ukanak amuykti.
He saw the worst.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan walinak uñjäna.
He wasn't like that at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkänti.
How they are.	Kunjamsa jupanakajj.

You guys are too!.	¡Jumanakax ukhamaraki!.
And the night before.	Ukat nayrïr arumax.
It doesn’t mean anything now.	Jichhax janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
I didn't really know what to do.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
I used to love that.	Nayax nayrax ukax walpun munta.
He never said anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns siskänti.

He understood that perfectly.	Jupajj uk sum amuyäna.

He told them he didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw ukham yatkti sasaw jupanakar säna.
But it’s not like that for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
I didn't really understand.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun amuykayätti.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.

That’s what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj munäna.

But I told him to hurry up.	Ukampis jankʼakiw ukham lurañama sasaw sista.

I really like this one!.	¡Nayatakix akax wali askiwa!.
I just don't see it that way.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum uñjkti.
He said it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.

Also, of course.	Ukhamaraki, chiqpachansa.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munäna.
And indeed it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
I never wanted to do that to anyone.	Janipuniw khitimpis ukham jan walinak lurañ munkayätti.

This happened twice.	Ukajj pä kutiw pasäna.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
But he knew all about it.	Ukampis jupajj taqe ukanak sum yatïna.
Nobody about that.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
I didn't do anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurkti.

There was nothing for me.	Nayatakejj janiw kunas utjkänti.

And that’s exactly what happened.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.
He’s been there many times.	Jupax walja kutiw ukan jikxatasïna.
He refused again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jan munkänti.

No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit parlañ munkti.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
My own self.	Nayan pachpa.

They are just .	Jupanakax ukhamakiw .

I didn’t have to do anything that night.	Uka arumax janiw kuns lurañax wakiskänti.
Whatever is happening.	Kunas kunas pasaski.
But he certainly did.	Ukampis cheqapuniw ukham luräna.
It was not a big deal.	Janiw mä jachʼa lurañajj utjkänti.
It will happen by itself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw pasani.
Both are not very useful.	Panpachaniw jan sinti askïkiti.
Or one day at a time.	Jan ukajj mä uru.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj walpun munasi.
But, not really.	Ukampis, janiw chiqpachansa.
I never wanted to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañ munkayätti.
I’m saying that myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham sista.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But I don't want to make it any bigger than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa lurañ munkti.

That’s pretty quick.	Ukax wali jank’akiw.
¡There is nothing!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti!.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I never wanted him to do that.	Janipuniw jupar ukham lurañap munkayätti.
We never had that.	Jiwasajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.

I can't say for sure.	Nayajj janiw sum sañjamäkiti.

He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
You make every day, and everything, better.	Jumax sapa uru, ukat taqi kuna, juk’amp suma lurasma.
He said he never did.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.

Quite the opposite, he did it twice.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, pä kutiw ukham luräna.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.
He’s a great guy.	Jupax jach’a jaqiwa.
I am looking forward to that day.	Uka uru suytʼaskta.
But no one knew what to do.	Ukampis janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkänti.

He doesn't think about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet amuykiti.
You’re a housewife.	Jumax uta jaqiwa.

No one now knows why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw khitis jichhajj yatkiti.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
And he didn't know why.	Ukat kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw yatkänti.
Almost nothing can be done.	Niya janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti.
That means something.	Ukax kuns sañ muni.

It’s really good for both of them.	Chiqpachansa panpachaniw ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
Something that needs to be done.	Kunas uka lurañax wakisi.

But that is not the case with us.	Ukampis janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkiti.
He never wanted to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurañ munkänti.

And beyond you.	Ukat jumat sipansa.
He knew how to make coffee.	Jupax café lurañ yatïna.
But he didn't say that now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukham siskänti.
I don’t want to.	Nayax janiw munkti.

He has only me.	Jupajj naya sapakiw utji.
But that is not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
So I didn't know what to do.	Ukhamajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
That was not the case at the time.	Uka tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He was doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraskäna.

It wasn’t.	Ukhamänwa.
That’s what happened.	Ukaw pasäna.

I have no idea what he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk janiw amuykti.

No, not really, but it feels like it.	Janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti, ukampis ukham amuyasi.

Anyway, this is it.	Kawkhansa, akax ukhamawa.
He thought he understood everything.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sum amuyta sasaw amuyäna.

So that’s why I’m using this.	Ukhamajj ukatwa nayax aka apnaqañ munta.
It happened many times.	Walja kutiw ukham pasäna.

He’s the guy.	Jupax uka jaqiwa.

I’ve done that.	Nayax ukham lurawayta.
He was obviously devastated.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
I don’t want to be alone.	Janiw nayax munkti.
I'm saying it again.	Nayajj wasitatwa sista.
This is not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.

He had no idea about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns amuykänti.
I’m very aware of this.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali sum yatta.
He did it alone.	Jupa sapakiw uk luräna.

He didn't know what he was doing.	Janiw kuntï jupajj luraskäna uk yatkänti.
That is what happened in the past.	Ukaw nayrajj pasäna.
The same thing happened to me.	Nayampejj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
I did it very carefully.	Nayax wali amuyumpiw uk lurawayta.
I’m not going to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkänti.
I don’t know what’s up with this.	Janiw nayax yatkti kunas aka tuqitxa.
He didn't do that now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj ukham lurkänti.
I really, really did.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa ukham lurawayta.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañas utjkänti.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk sum yatiyäta.

But that happened.	Ukampis ukajj pasäna.
How do you feel about it.	Kunjamsa jumajj amuyta.
I want that for myself.	Nayatakix uk munta.
He knew it all too well.	Jupajj wali sumwa uka toqet yatïna.

That’s how he is.	Ukhamaw jupax utji.
Or so it was.	Jan ukajj ukhamänwa.
Never, never, never.	Janipuniw, janipuniw, janipuniw.
And he knows everything.	Ukat jupax taqi kun yati.
In a positive way, of course.	Mä suma tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

He really didn’t want to go there.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka chiqar sarañ munkänti.
He doesn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykiti.
Anyway, that’s it for me.	Kawkhansa, ukax nayatakix ukhamawa.

On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
He doesn't want to talk.	Janiw parlañ munkiti.
He did leave.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sarjjäna.

You don’t need that.	Jumax janiw ukax wakiskiti.

But it is not possible to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He saw what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk uñjäna.
So there was nothing left.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
He understood it perfectly.	Jupajj sumwa amuyäna.
What's the.	Kunas uka.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But it really happened.	Ukampis cheqapuniw ukham pasäna.
That was the case for me.	Nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
He didn't want to see her.	Jupajj janiw jupar uñjañ munkänti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kunas lurañax utjkiti.

Did you know that it exists.	¿Ukax utji uk yattati.
And he knew how.	Ukat kunjamsa uk yatïna.

In this case he will do exactly that.	Uka tuqitxa jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurani.
He loved her so much.	Jupajj jupar wal munäna.

Why, he didn't know.	Kunatsa, janiw yatkänti.

No one wanted to see it.	Janiw khitis uk uñjañ munkänti.

He did it.	Uk luräna.
Now I don't know exactly what happened.	Jichhajj kunas ukajj pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
I don’t know when that day will be.	Uka urux kunapachas utjani uk janiw yatkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
He took care of her.	Jupaw jupar uñjäna.
He knew what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.

You have to do something for yourself.	Juma pachpaw kuns lurañama.

So there is clarity.	Ukhamajj qhanaw utji.
I didn't do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurkti.
It was never necessary.	Janipuniw ukajj wakiskänti.
I’m just saying that.	Nayax ukhamakiw siskta.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkänti.

He couldn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurañ puedkänti.
He didn't believe it.	Jupajj janiw iyaw siskänti.

But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luratayna.
In this case it is not.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.

Not probably about that.	Janiw inas uka tuqitxa.
He didn't need to.	Jupajj janiw wakiskänti.
We can’t believe it.	Jiwasax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.

So what is the value? 	Ukhamajj ¿kunsa?
he says, 'It's not.	sasaw saraki.
Almost nothing to do .	Niya janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti .
He really couldn’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañ puedkänti.

I don't know exactly what he's doing.	Taqe kuntï luraski uk janiw sum yatkti.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.

But he didn't understand that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uk amuykänti.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañas utjkänti.
He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
That is not what he wants to do.	Ukajj janiw kuntï lurañ munkiti.
We know a sum.	Uk sum yatta.
I really think he meant it.	Chiqpachansa, jupax uk sañ munäna sasaw amuyta.
Now, you just have to.	Jichhax, jumax ukhamakiw.
And he immediately began to do it.	Ukat jankʼakiw lurañ qalltäna.
And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
I am very excited about it.	Nayajj uka toqet wal kusista.
That’s where it started.	Ukaw qalltäna.
I'm not sure who said that first.	Khitis nayraqat ukham säna uk janiw sum yatkti.
You know it well enough.	Jumax sum yatisktawa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
I’m still waiting.	Nayax wali suyt’askta.

He doesn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parlañ munkiti.
Over and over and over again.	Walja kutiw walja kuti ukat walja kuti.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
I'm saying something.	Nayax kuns sista.
This is not enough time.	Ukajj janiw tiempojj wakiskiti.
I had no idea what it was.	Kunas ukajj uk janiw amuykayätti.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukham amuyasïna.
But there was nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkänti.
I’m still waiting, actually.	Nayax wali suyt’askta, chiqpachansa.
I mean, I’m sorry.	Nayax sañ munta.
So that's a good thing.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali askiwa.
A better me.	Mä juk’amp suma naya.
That’s exactly what it is.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa.
I know exactly what he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk sum yatta.
But I didn’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkti.
It’s worth doing this.	Uka lurañax wali askiwa.
There is not much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
I think this is certainly the case.	Nayax amuyta akax chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
I haven’t seen any of that.	Janiw ukanak uñjkti.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw uk luräna.
But there was no such thing.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañajj utjkänti.
I don’t want him one.	Nayax janiw jupar mä munkti.
It happened during the day.	Ukajj uruw pasäna.
I don't believe that.	Nayajj janiw uk creykti.
I don’t know when, how, or why.	Kunapachas, kunjamatsa, kunatsa uk janiw yatkti.

I'm going to love it.	Nayajj walpun munta.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He is better than I am today.	Jupax jichhürunakanxa nayat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
And the worst kind.	Ukat jukʼamp jan wali kasta.
He didn't really say anything.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun kunatsa ukham siskänti.
I didn't mean it.	Janiw nayajj uk sañ munkayätti.
So he’s like that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamawa.
I don't quite know what to do about it.	Janiw uka toqet kun lurañsa taqpach yatkti.
He’s very excited.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.

I know how it feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.

You are an amazing person.	Jumax muspharkañ jaqiwa.

It’s been a great experience for me!.	¡Nayatakix wali askiwa!.
Nobody wants that.	Janiw khitis uk munkiti.
I knew he would.	Ukham lurani uk sum yatiyäta.
Now he’s .	Jichhax jupax .
I thought it was pretty obvious.	Nayax wali qhanaw sasaw amuyayäta.
He is a.	Jupax mä...
That’s where it started.	Ukaw qalltäna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
There was no reason.	Janiw kunatsa utjkänti.
But there is no set time limit.	Ukampis janiw mä qhawqha tiempojj utjkiti.
But it obviously wasn’t.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukhamäkänti.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
The.	Jupa.
That’s how it feels.	Ukhamaw ukham jikxatasi.
He wanted to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurañ munäna.
I know it wasn't.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, uk sum yatta.
I want to be like that.	Nayax ukham munta.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkti sasaw säna.
I’m feeling pretty good.	Nayax wali sum jikxatastxa.
He wanted to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa munäna.
I, of course, don’t.	Nayax, chiqpachansa, janiw ukham lurkti.
But it was, at least.	Ukampis ukhamänwa, mä jukʼa.
Or it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
He knew that sort of thing.	Jupajj uka kasta yatïna.
He knew what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I am in love!!!!!.	Nayax munasiñampiw jikxatastxa!!!!!.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I just asked the question.	Nayax ukhamakiw jiskt’asta.
He said it takes a lot of time.	Walja tiempow wakisi sasaw säna.
I didn't want to talk to him.	Nayajj janiw jupamp parlañ munkayätti.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
I never understood it.	Janipuniw amuykayätti.
You’re right.	Jumax amuyta.
There is no way to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax utjkiti.
I know it's pretty good.	Nayax wali sum yatta.
They were, they were.	Wali, wali.
It never occurred to me that I didn't need it.	Nayatakejj janiw ukajj wakiskiti sasin janipuniw amuykänti.
He’s got a lot of energy.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
I'm still going to do it.	Nayax wali munta.
So I ask why.	Ukatwa kunatsa jisktʼasta.
I never understood that.	Janipuniw uk amuykayätti.
I didn’t know what to do.	Janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
But I won’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkäti.
Why not do that again?.	¿Kunatsa jan mayamp ukham lurañax wakisispa?.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I think it was.	Nayajj ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
I see this a lot.	Nayax akax walpun uñjta.
He did it anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk luräna.

It’s this or nothing.	Ukax aka jan ukax janiw kunas.
That's what happened.	Ukaw pasani.
Both of you are.	Panpachaniw jumanakax.

He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
But you must act quickly.	Ukampis jumajj jankʼakiw lurañama.
That was the case.	Ukajj ukhamänwa.
He tried to do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.
A new day has arrived.	Mä machaq uruw purini.
But I can’t do it alone.	Ukampis janiw naya sapaki uk lurañjamäkiti.
That is not the best way to do it.	Ukham lurañajj janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw yatkti.
He did well for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempojj sumwa luräna.
But not in this case.	Ukampis janiw aka tuqitxa.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t want to do that.	Janiw ukanak lurañ munkti.
I don't remember exactly.	Janiw sum amtaskti.
Really? 	Chiqpachansa?

But not this guy.	Ukampis janiw aka waynax utjkiti.
I didn’t understand how.	Kunjamsa uk jan amuykayätti.
He didn't say that.	Jupajj janiw uk siskänti.
But all the time is worth it.	Ukampis taqe uka tiempojj wali askiwa.
Honestly, that wasn’t what I had.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukax nayatakix utjkänti.
She falls in love with him immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupar munasi.
He’s the one who did it.	Jupaw uk lurawayi.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupax wali llakitaw sarnaqäna.
It was nothing at all.	Ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

I want to say something.	Nayax kuns sañ munta.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He didn’t say it anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans uk siskänti.
That's what he said.	Ukhamaw jupajj säna.
But how does it work? 	Ukampis ¿kunjamatsa?
That is not the case now.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was no such thing before.	Uka nayrajj janiw utjkänti.
I don’t want to do that.	Janiw nayax ukham lurañ munkti.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
Nothing can be done about it now.	Jichhax janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañjamäkiti.
All or nothing, he said.	Taqi kunas jan ukax janiw kunas, sasaw säna.
He doesn't know how he wants it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï jupajj munki uk yatkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Financially worth it.	Qullqi tuqitxa wali askiwa.
And he never did that.	Ukat janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
I'm going to go.	Nayax sarañ munta.
I don’t want anything .	Nayax janiw kuns munkti .
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
I want to go a lot.	Nayax walpun sarañ munta.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
No one wanted to know about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit yatiñ munkänti.
He knew how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañ sum yatïna.
He walked and walked.	Jupax sarnaqäna ukat sarnaqäna.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
There is no .	Ukax mä .
But again, not us.	Ukampis mayampsa, janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkiti.
Well, I'm not the one.	Ukhamajj janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.
He didn’t know how he knew.	Kunjamsa jupax yatïna uk janiw yatkänti.
I think this is it.	Nayax amuyta, akax ukhamawa.
He was gone for three years.	Jupajj kimsa maraw jan sarjjäna.
That’s what he did.	Ukhamaw jupajj luräna.
He said it was worth it.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw säna.
Or it doesn't.	Jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
I don't know how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatkti.
There was nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkänti.
It wasn’t.	Ukhamänwa.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Jupax alañ munta sasaw säna.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
But, you can do really well.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa wali sumwa lurasma.

How well he saw the night.	Kunjamsa uka arumax sum uñjäna.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
It doesn't exist.	Janiw ukajj utjkiti.
He began to tell me about the day.	Uka urux kunas pasäna uk yatiyañ qalltäna.
He knows something.	Jupax kuns yati.

And you just .	Ukat jumax ukhamakiw .
He didn't know what to make of it all.	Jupajj janiw kunsa taqe ukanak lurañap yatkänti.

Too much of something isn’t good for anyone.	Kunas sinti walja lurañax janiw khitirus askïkiti.
But it’s not like that for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
No one really knows what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkiti.
A little bit of a big one.	Mä juk’a jach’a.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukajj ukhamäkiti.
That was the case.	Ukajj ukhamänwa.
And there he was again.	Ukat ukan wasitatwa jikxatasïna.
I don’t want to stay in this house.	Nayax janiw aka utan qhiparañ munkti.
But in one respect it was.	Ukampis mä tuqitxa ukhamänwa.

I’ve never seen him so bad.	Janipuniw jupar ukham jan wali uñjkti.
I'm not doing that right now.	Nayajj janiw jichhajj ukham lurkti.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.
It wasn't like that before.	Nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
There has never been such a thing.	Janipuniw kunapachas ukham jan walinak utjkänti.
He went with her.	Jupajj jupamp chikaw sarjjäna.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
In fact, it was.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.
He said he never quite understood what he was trying to say.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk janipuniw sum amuykti sasaw säna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It's not necessary.	Janiwa wakiskiti.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He didn't believe it.	Jupajj janiw iyaw siskänti.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Or what he didn't do.	Jan ukajj kuntï jan lurkäna uk.
He did this three times.	Kimsa kutiw ukham luräna.
I'm going to know.	Nayax yatiñ munta.
At home, at school.	Utan, yatiqañ utan.
I didn't need that, never needed it.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj wakiskänti, janiw kunapachas wakiskänti.
That hadn’t been the case for, well, a while.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkänti, wali, mä juk’a pachaw ukhamäkänti.
There is no need to do this.	Janiw uk lurañax wakiskiti.
I know that's it.	Nayajj uk yattwa.
And so it is.	Ukat ukhamaraki.
This is apparently not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
I never thought anything about it.	Janipuniw uka toqet kuns amuyirïkti.
I don't know how that's going to happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkti.
I don't know.	Janiw yatkti.
Both of you are.	Panpachaniw jumanakax.
I want to talk about you.	Nayax jumat parlañ munta.
He did this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham luräna.
I don’t really think so.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham amuykti.
There was no such thing for me.	Nayatakix janiw ukham utjkänti.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
I know exactly what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj siskäna uk sum yatta.
No, it didn't make sense.	Janiwa, janiw ukajj amuyaskänti.
That day lives another day.	Uka urux yaqha uruw jakasi.
No, he wasn't like that.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t mean to say that.	Janiw nayax ukham sañ munkti.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
It was a slow motion.	Ukhamwa amuyasïna.

Good word.	Suma aru.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham uñjkti.
And the next day.	Ukat qhipürux.
But now he did nothing to do so.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukham lurañatakejj kuns lurkänti.
Almost no one knew about you.	Niya janiw khitis jumat yatkänti.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He felt very mature.	Jupajj wali jilïr jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
I know that’s not good enough.	Nayax yattwa ukax janiw askïkiti.
Nice and soft.	Suma ukat llamp’u.

And this isn’t the case.	Ukat akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I like that about you.	Nayax jumat ukham wali askiwa.
He didn’t say why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa ukham siskänti.
But that’s not the point.	Ukampis ukax janiw uka tuqitxa.
This is not something you can do.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
Or some kind of car.	Jan ukax mä kasta auto.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He doesn't have anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
That’s totally fine.	Ukax taqpach wali askiwa.
That was what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj wal munäna.
There is a slight .	Ukax mä juk'a .
He doesn’t want to believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañ munkiti.
He was a good man, she thought.	Jupax suma jaqiwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.
He doesn’t know what’s going on.	Jupax janiw kunas pasaski uk yatkiti.
Or it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
I feel the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
I haven’t seen it yet.	Janiw jichhakamax uñjkti.
Both of you are.	Panpachaniw jumanakax.
But I don't know exactly how to do it.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa uk lurañajj uk sum yatkti.
It wasn’t like that for me.	Janiw nayatakix ukhamäkänti.
It really takes a good amount of time.	Chiqpachansa, mä suma tiempow munasi.
I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurawayta.
This was quite obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw jikjjatasïna.
This is rarely the case.	Ukajj janiw sinti utjkiti.
That’s what it means now.	Ukax jichhax sañ muni.

Very happy and excited about this.	Wali kusisitaw ukat kusisitaw aka tuqitxa.
He just knew exactly what that felt like.	Kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasïna uk jichhakiw sum yatïna.
That's what you do best.	Ukaw jumajj jukʼamp sum lurasma.
But he didn't do it very often.	Ukampis janiw walja kuti ukham lurkänti.

It’s already coming.	Ukax niyaw purini.
He was just there.	Jupax ukhamakiw ukan jikxatasïna.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Tomorrow has all the potential to be a good day.	Qhipürux taqi ch’amampiw mä suma urux utjani.
There is nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkiti.
She immediately felt a little better.	Ukat jankʼakiw mä jukʼa sum jikjjatasïna.

He knew he wasn't.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti, uk sum yatïna.
He knows better than I do.	Jupajj nayat sipansa jukʼamp sum yati.

He was well aware of this.	Jupajj uka toqet sumwa yatïna.
I don't know how he's going to get through.	Kunjamsa jupajj pasani uk janiw yatkti.
But the !!!.	Ukampis uka !!!.
I’m really looking forward to this.	Chiqpachansa nayax aka tuqit suyt’askta.
No one knows the answer.	Janiw khitis yatkiti.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
It’s all or nothing.	Taqi kunas jan ukax janiw kunas utjkiti.
But he couldn't, he knew.	Ukampis janiw puedkänti, uk sum yatïna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
But he didn't know exactly why.	Ukampis kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
That means a lot.	Ukax walja sañ muni.
He wanted to know why.	Kunatsa uk yatiñ munäna.
It’s been a long time now.	Walja pachaw jichhax.
But nobody really wants that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk cheqpachapun munkiti.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nayax janiw kuns uka tuqit yatkti.

Or rather, somehow.	Jan ukajj sañ munäna, kunjamatsa.

Over and over and over again.	Walja kutiw walja kuti ukat walja kuti.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I'm not sure.	Nayax yattwa.
It was like that for me.	Nayatakix ukhamänwa.
He’s done that.	Jupax ukham lurawayi.
Why, he didn’t know.	Kunatsa, jupax janiw yatkänti.
I thought that was not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyayäta.
That doesn’t mean much on its own.	Ukax janiw sapakix walpun sañ munkiti.
You’re better off.	Jumax juk’amp askiwa.

There was nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkänti.
Of course you know.	Chiqpachansa jumax yatisktawa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

It’s not about the money.	Janiw qullqi tuqitxa.

He didn't say anything to them.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupanakar siskänti.

There was no need for a new one.	Janiw machaq lurañax wakiskänti.

He meant it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw uk sañ munäna.
Nothing felt like that.	Janiw kunas ukham amuyaskänti.

He wants to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa munta.
There was no one about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit utjkänti.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
He's a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach'a jaqiwa.

I’m still yours .	Nayax wali jumanakan .
I don't want to be alone.	Janiw nayajj munkti.

He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
And so he is.	Ukat ukhamaw jupax.
So it was kind of like that.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa ukhamänwa.
That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.	Ukajj janiw jan utjkiti sañ munkiti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

I’m looking forward to having dinner with him.	Nayax jupamp manq’añ suyt’askta.
That’s not necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti.
You're the one who knows.	Jumax yatisktawa.

I didn't say anything to him.	Janiw nayajj jupar kuns siskti.

And he didn't want to hurt her.	Ukat janiw jupar jan walinak lurañ munkänti.

I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
But he didn't say that.	Ukampis janiw uk siskänti.
He thinks it’s worth it.	Jupax wali askiwa sasaw amuyi.

He did exactly that.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham luräna.

He didn't say anything to them.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupanakar siskänti.

He's a good guy.	Jupajj sumwa amuyi.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I never saw him again.	Janipuniw mayampsa jupar uñjkti.

He said he didn’t remember.	Janiw amtaskti sasaw säna.

But you can’t say, you can’t.	Ukampis janiw sañjamäkiti, janiw sañjamäkiti.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
So he said drink.	Ukatwa jupax umañ säna.
And that is what he did.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj luräna.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.

I don’t know why, really.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti, chiqpachansa.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
This is not economically viable.	Ukax qullqi tuqitx janiw askïkiti.
They are not .	Jupanakax janiw .
But I wasn't sure what he was doing.	Ukampis kuntï jupajj luraskäna uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
Really.	Chiqpachansa.
Something happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna.
He knows that.	Jupax uk yattwa.
I didn’t want to tell him.	Janiw nayax jupar yatiyañ munkayätti.

He took care of her.	Jupaw jupar uñjäna.

Now I know how to use you.	Jichhajj kunjamsa jumanakar apnaqañ yatta.
I don’t know, I don’t want to know.	Nayax janiw yatkti, janiw yatiñ munkti.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Jan ukax khitirus, uka tuqitxa.
He’s such a nice guy.	Jupax ukham suma jaqiwa.

I didn’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurkti.
I don't see it properly.	Nayajj janiw sum uñjkti.
There’s nothing there.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkiti.

They certainly were.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
He didn't think it was necessary.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti sasin amuykänti.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
Really, somehow.	Chiqpachansa, kunjamatsa.
He took it very seriously.	Jupajj uk wali sumwa uñjäna.
Or at least it was for me.	Jan ukajj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
He knows what he is doing.	Kuntï luraski uk sum yati.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw amuykayätti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
You’re not like that.	Jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
He didn’t realize it.	Janiw amuyaskänti.
I have seen it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk uñjta.
This is impossible to do.	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
For a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempo.
He didn't know but he thought he did.	Jupajj janiw yatkänti ukampis yattwa sasaw amuyasïna.
He did what he did well.	Jupajj kuntï lurkäna uk sumwa luräna.
He’s the one who made her.	Jupaw jupar luratayna.
It’s not a very good thing.	Janiw wali askïkiti.
It was just as he said it would be.	Kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukhamänwa.
How are you doing.	Kunjamatsa jumax.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he did it several more times.	Ukat jukʼamp walja kutiw ukham luräna.
I think it was.	Nayajj ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
That is what he has to do.	Ukaw jupajj lurañapa.
You know how to do it.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjamsa lurasma.
You can do that now.	Jichhajj ukham lurasma.
And he immediately began to do it.	Ukat jankʼakiw lurañ qalltäna.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He saw it for himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk uñjäna.
He knows exactly what to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapa uk sum yati.
He’s still a human being.	Jupax wali jaqiwa.
Whatever you want.	Kuntï jumajj munkta uk.
You can easily do this at home.	Utan jankʼakiw uk lurasma.
He wanted it for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow wal munäna.

I think so .	Nayax ukham amuyta .
I know what he wants and needs.	Kuntï jupajj munki ukat kunsa munki uk sum yatta.
He never wants to see them again.	Janipuniw jupanakar mayamp uñjañ munkiti.

For the first time he thought.	Nayrïr kutiw jupajj amuyäna.
And this other thing, too.	Ukat aka yaqha tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But you need to do it quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw uk lurañama.
I didn’t know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw yatkayätti.

I can't believe it.	Janiw nayajj iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I absolutely need it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wakisi.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He can’t have it both ways.	Jupax janiw pä tuqit ukax utjkaspati.
The more anyone does, the less likely they are to understand it.	Khitis jukʼamp kuns luraski ukhajja, janiw uk sum amuykiti.
But it’s not what you want.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamäkiti.
He says he won’t do it.	Jupax janiw uk lurkäti sasaw saraki.

I just can’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
And he knew it well.	Ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
And so it went on.	Ukat ukhamaw saräna.

And that’s just it.	Ukat ukax ukhamakiw.

Beyond that, he didn't do anything.	Ukat sipansa, janiw kuns lurkänti.
He just did it that way.	Jupajj ukhamakiw ukham luräna.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw satawa.

None of it could do it.	Janiw kunas ukanak lurañ puedkänti.
He didn't want to talk about anything more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kunatsa parlañ munkänti.
I have the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw utjitu.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.

This is not possible yet.	Ukax janiw jichhakamax lurañjamäkiti.

That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I want to tell him what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk jupar yatiyañ munta.

That’s just the way it is.	Ukax ukhamakiw.

But that is not the case now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

He knew it was impossible to say.	Janiw sañjamäkiti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
It feels really intense.	Chiqpachansa wali ch’amampiw jikxatasi.

I didn’t tell him anything.	Janiw kuns jupar siskti.

He did it for the guy.	Jupajj uk luräna.

He didn't feel that way.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuyaskänti.

There are two ways to do this.	Akax pä lurañaw utji.

I really don’t want to see the book again.	Chiqpachansa janiw mayamps uka libro uñjañ munkti.
There was no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkänti.

I didn’t know how to do it.	Janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkayätti.
He’s a very bad guy.	Jupax wali jan wali jaqiwa.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think about that.	Nayax uka tuqit amuyta.
He said he loved it.	Jupajj uk walpun munta sasaw säna.
But, obviously, that’s not the case.	Ukampis, qhanaw, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He decided to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw lurañ amtäna.
And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
In fact, it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
But he didn't want to know.	Ukampis jupajj janiw yatiñ munkänti.
There was no way I was going to do that.	Janiw kunjamatsa uk lurañajj utjkänti.
I want this one.	Nayax akax munta.

I don’t want that.	Janiw nayax uk munkti.
I don’t want to, of course.	Nayax janiw munkti, chiqpachansa.
I don’t want to go there.	Janiw nayax uka chiqar sarañ munkti.

No one knows about it.	Janiw khitis yatkti.
He said it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.
That’s how it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax wakisi.

But it wasn't, he wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I really don’t care.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax kuns lurkti.

So that’s how it started.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa qalltäna.
I don't know how to help him.	Janiw kunjamsa jupar yanaptʼañ yatkti.
I didn’t want to do anything about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munkayätti.

I didn't do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurkti.

No, he decided.	Janiwa, sasaw amtäna.

So what does it matter.	Ukhamajj kunas ukajj wakisi.
For a while it wasn't.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.

But he did it anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukham luräna.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
He did that to her.	Jupaw jupar ukham luräna.
I am really, really sorry.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa llakistwa.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

But whatever, whatever.	Ukampis kunas, kunas.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyäna.

But you know that.	Ukampis jumax uk yatisktawa.

And no one knows about it.	Ukat janiw khitis uka toqet yatkiti.
He was still in a state of shock.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
He knows about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yati.

I feel like that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyasta.
I’m so good for you.	Nayax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
And a nobody.	Ukat mä jan khitis.

Such a long time.	Ukham jaya tiempo.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.

I would definitely do them again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw jupanakar wasitat lurañ munta.
And it wasn’t like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkänti.
Nothing is very interesting.	Janiw kunas wali askïkiti.
But he did it somehow.	Ukampis kunjamatsa uk luräna.
He didn't know where to go.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus sarañ yatkänti.
You want me to be myself.	Jumax naya pachpaw munta.
It’s better to do this.	Uka lurañax juk’amp askiwa.

Nothing about it now.	Jichhax janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
Somehow, he didn’t understand.	Kunjamatsa, janiw amuykänti.
But it really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that doesn't mean you can't do anything.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kun lurañjamäkiti sañ munkiti.
He’s not like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
That's what I don't know.	Ukajj janiw yatkti.

I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurawayta.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s what happened.	Ukax kunas pasäna.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas wakiskiti.
That’s exactly what it is.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw sañ muni.

But it wasn't necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.

He wasn't sure what he was saying.	Jupajj janiw kuntï siskäna uk sum yatkänti.

Now, it’s time to do it.	Jichhax, uk lurañ pachaw purini.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He had no idea what was going on.	Jupajj janiw kunas paskäna uk amuykänti.
It’s not my best interest.	Janiw nayan askïkiti.
He wanted to do everything but with her.	Jupajj taqe kun lurañwa munäna, ukampis jupamp chikaw lurañ munäna.
There's a.	Ukax mä.

And another thing.	Ukat yaqha tuqitxa.
He did what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luräna.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.

This is the best thing I’ve ever done.	Akax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sum yatta.
He did it for real, so he did it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk luräna, ukatwa uk luräna.
You know he will do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurani uk yatisktawa.
He didn't understand why.	Kunatsa uk janiw amuykänti.
Large and spacious.	Jach’a ukat jach’a.
And nobody did it.	Ukat janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
There is plenty of time.	Walja tiempow utji.

There is a lot of interest in this.	Uka tuqitxa wali askiwa.

I really didn’t really want to.	Chiqpachansa janiw chiqpachapuni munkayätti.
This is by no means the case.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
No one knew what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
But it didn't have to be that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It’s really good for you.	Chiqpachansa jumatakix wali askiwa.
He was like that.	Jupax ukhamänwa.
But there is no such thing.	Ukampis janiw ukham utjkiti.
This one is really interesting.	Akax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He wanted it badly enough.	Jupajj jan walpun munäna.
She was so happy to see him again.	Jupar wasitat uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

Which is exactly what he did.	Ukajj cheqapuniw jupajj luräna.

He needs some time.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow munasi.
Of course I did, he thought.	Chiqpachansa nayax uk lurawayta, sasaw jupax amuyäna.

I just wanted to say that.	Nayax ukhamakiw sañ munta.

But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
That’s nothing about it.	Ukax janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
He didn’t say why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa siskänti.
And he saw more.	Ukat jukʼamp uñjäna.

He didn't know what else he could do.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jukʼamp luraspa uk yatkänti.

There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

There wasn't much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
He didn't understand what she was saying.	Jupajj janiw kuntï siskäna uk amuykänti.

But that night he did something wrong.	Ukampis uka arumax jan walinak luräna.

But somehow.	Ukampis kunjamatsa.
He is a very happy person.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
That’s why something is happening.	Ukatwa kunas pasaski.

The price is well worth it.	Uka qullqix wali askiwa.
And maybe you should do something nice about it.	Ukat inas uka tuqitxa mä suma lurañax wakischispa.

That’s where it started.	Ukaw qalltäna.

But he wasn't like that .	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti .
He didn't know how or when.	Kunjamsa, kunapachas uk janiw yatkänti.
That doesn't work for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
This is not considered necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti sasaw amuyasi.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
You can’t do everything by yourself.	Janiw juma sapakix taqi kun lurañjamäkiti.

I don't know how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uk janiw yatkti.
And beyond that, it’s not necessary.	Ukat ukat sipansa, janiw wakiskiti.

And he did it very well.	Ukat wali sumwa uk luräna.

But I don't know that for sure.	Ukampis janiw ukajj sum yatkti.

It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
You're a great guy.	Jumax wali jach'a jaqiwa.
He started doing something.	Kun lurañ qalltäna.
He wasn't sure what had caused it.	Kunas ukham luratayna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
I don’t really know why.	Janiw chiqpachansa kunatsa uk yatkti.
What can you do there.	¿Kunsa ukan lurasma.
He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
A couple of times, maybe.	Mä pä kuti, inas.
He will do very well.	Jupax wali sum lurani.
That’s exactly what it is.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa.
I don't care what he said.	Kuntï siskäna ukajj janiw nayatak wakiskiti.
Nothing more to do here.	Janiw kunas juk’amp lurañax akan utjkiti.
They don’t mean anything to me.	Jupanakax janiw kunas nayatakix askïkiti.
But that is not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
And that’s exactly what’s happening.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw pasaski.
This may take some time to do.	Uk lurañatakejj inas mä jukʼa tiempojj wakischispa.
I don’t know what it is.	Janiw kunas uk yatkti.
There's a.	Ukax mä.
Or a car.	Jan ukajj mä auto.
He started again.	Jupajj wasitatwa qalltäna.
Fortunately so far, that’s not the case.	Jichhakamax wali askiwa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
I think so too.	Nayax ukhamarakiw amuyta.
I don't know that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham yatkti.
I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it.	Nayax janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
There is a slowdown.	Ukhamaw utji.
And I didn't want to tell anyone about it.	Ukat janiw khitirus uka toqet yatiyañ munkayätti.

I’m definitely.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw.
You just can’t do it.	Jumax ukhamakiw lurasma.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
That was not the case today.	Jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
I thought this was him.	Akax jupaw sasaw amuyayäta.
I think you know that.	Nayax amuyta jumax uk yatisktawa.
Really good indeed.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa chiqpachansa.
He never asked for anything.	Janipuniw kunsa mayïna.
And besides, he doesn’t have a .	Ukat ukat sipansa, jupax janiw mä .
He decided it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk amtäna.
Which will do, of course.	Kunas lurani, chiqpachansa.
There is nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkiti.
I want to tell them.	Nayax jupanakar yatiyañ munta.
It happened both ways.	Panpachaniw pasäna.
There's a.	Ukax mä.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He said that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
But he wanted something.	Ukampis jupajj kunsa munäna.
But I haven’t done that recently.	Ukampis jichhakiw janiw ukham lurkti.
I don’t mean that.	Janiw nayax uk sañ munkti.
I’m sorry for you.	Nayax jumat llakistwa.
I don’t want to know.	Janiw nayax yatiñ munkti.
I’m waiting for two more.	Nayax juk’amp pä suyt’askta.
He’s really simply unavailable.	Jupax chiqpachansa jank’akiw jan utjkiti.
She didn't have him.	Jupajj janiw jupajj utjkänti.
But he didn't want to.	Ukampis janiw uk munkänti.
It wasn't necessary.	Janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
I don’t really know.	Janiw cheqpachapun yatkti.
He was alone now.	Jupajj jichhajj sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Good or bad.	Suma jan ukax jan wali.
Many times you don’t need to do anything.	Walja kutiw jan kun lurañax wakiskiti.
I don’t think you can do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
He didn't know what was going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
You know where it is.	Jumax kawkhans uk yatisktawa.
Not the case now.	Janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
Over and over and over again.	Walja kutiw walja kuti ukat walja kuti.
There’s nothing there.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkiti.

There is nothing, and never.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, ukat janipuniw.
Or he was, anyway.	Jan ukajj jupajj ukhamänwa, kunjamatsa.
I wasn't sure why he had to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañapa uk janiw sum amuykayätti.
He didn’t, you know.	Jupax janiw uk lurkänti, jumax yatisktawa.
So it happened again.	Ukhamajj wasitatwa pasäna.
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
But he was still like that.	Ukampis jupax wali ukhamänwa.
There really is nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkiti.
Or it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
And so it will be.	Ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
But he really wants to do that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham lurañwa walpun munta.
That’s really cool.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wali suma.
He didn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.
Well, he didn't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj ukham lurkänti.
But you can't do these things all the time.	Ukampis janiw ukanak sapa kuti lurañjamäkiti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
Two two two two.	Pä pä pä pä.
I know he wasn’t.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
They’re too big, or too big.	Jupanakax wali jach’a, jan ukax wali jach’a.
Or it doesn't.	Jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That means you have to do it yourself.	Ukajj juma pachpaw uk lurañama sañ muni.
I have said this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham sista.

He saw that she did not understand.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti uk uñjäna.
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali askiwa.
But he didn't know anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns yatkänti.
I don’t think he is.	Nayax janiw jupax ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
This was not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He is currently in his first year.	Jichhax nayrïr maraw jikxatasi.
But, that doesn’t mean anything.	Ukampis, ukax janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
I really feel that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham amuyasta.

He knew exactly what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.

But I never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkti.
He felt that there was nothing he could do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati sasaw amuyasïna.

He gave it to them.	Jupaw jupanakar uk churäna.
I don’t say anything.	Janiw kuns siskti.

He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
He didn't want anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa munkänti.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He knows it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk yati.
But you know, it’s never enough.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa, janipuniw ukax wakiskiti.
But beyond that, he didn't know what to do.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
And indeed, it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.
He was a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali askiwa.
That is what he decided to do.	Ukaw jupajj amtäna.
No, not really, he said.	Janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa, sasaw säna.

I don’t think so, of course.	Janiw nayax uk amuykti, chiqpachansa.
But there is definitely room for improvement.	Ukampis cheqapuniw jukʼamp sum lurañajj utji.
I’ve done exactly that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayta.
Now there is nothing again.	Jichhax janiw kunas wasitat utjkiti.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
But it’s very sad for me.	Ukampis nayatakix wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
I think it will take some time.	Nayax amuyta, mä juk’a pachaw munasini.
You know, you know.	Jumax yatisktawa, jumax yatisktawa.
He felt very good about himself.	Jupajj wali sumwa amuyasïna.
But, there was nothing.	Ukampis, janiw kunas utjkänti.
Now I don’t care.	Jichhax janiw nayax kuns lurkti.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
And a very nice house.	Ukat wali suma uta.
To be honest, no one did.	Chiqpachansa, janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I don’t know why I don’t know.	Janiw kunatsa jan yatkti.
There is only one.	Mä sapakiw.
I feel good about myself.	Naya pachpaw sum jikjjatasta.
He is doing much better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luraski.
I never wanted to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañ munkayätti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
I think that’s what he was doing.	Nayax amuyta, ukax jupaw luraskäna.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m sorry it happened.	Nayax llakistwa ukax pasäna.
There’s just that.	Ukanx ukhamakiw utji.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Janiw kunas pasaski uk yatkayätti.
I knew exactly what he was going to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
Which, of course, he doesn’t.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’ve done this once.	Mä kutiw ukham lurawayta.
You know that, you know.	Jumax uk yatisktawa.

It’s going well so far.	Jichhakamax wali sum saraski.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Everything is happening.	Taqi kunas pasaski.

He told me that.	Jupaw ukham sitäna.

I’m hoping for a pretty good one.	Nayax mä suma suma suyt’askta.
You are a very nice person.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.

These are the things that need to be done.	Ukanak lurañaw wakisi.
But more needs to be done soon.	Ukampis jankʼakiw jukʼamp lurañax wakisi.
I haven’t seen him in a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw jan jupar uñjkti.
He gave her what she wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk churäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
You know how it’s in town.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams markanx utji.
Or anyone for that matter.	Jan ukax khitirus uka tuqitxa.
I think otherwise.	Nayax yaqha tuqit amuyta.
He wanted to see her.	Jupar uñjañ wal munäna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
Or nearly as good.	Jan ukajj niya ukhamarakiw wali suma.
He meant what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk sañ munäna.
So he did just that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
It may never exist.	Inas janipuniw utjkaspati.
I love that so much.	Nayax ukax walpun munta.
He went faster.	Jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw saräna.
Or it doesn't.	Jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
So he went away.	Ukatwa jupajj saräna.
This is the most interesting.	Akax juk'amp askiwa.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
He was the only one with her.	Jupa sapakiw jupamp chika sarnaqäna.
I can't have them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakajj utjkaspati.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
He never did that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
And it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukat janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
We don’t have that.	Jiwasax janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he didn't want that.	Ukat janiw uk munkänti.
Who is doing this.	Khitis ukham luraski.
He knew with pain.	Jupajj wali llakitaw yatïna.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
This is a very sensible thing to do.	Ukajj wali amuyumpiw luraski.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
I didn’t see anyone.	Janiw khitirus uñjkti.
I don't understand why he wants to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ muni uk janiw amuykti.
He’s an amazing guy.	Jupax mä muspharkañ jaqiwa.
But he can’t do that.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I want the job.	Nayax uka irnaqäw munta.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
I am very happy about that.	Uka toqet wal kusista.
That’s what he did.	Ukaw jupajj luräna.
He was the one who saw it all.	Jupaw taqe ukanak uñjäna.
In the case of the.	Uka tuqitxa, uka...

Everything is just me.	Taqi kunas naya sapakiw utji.
And no one knows exactly what happened to them.	Ukat kunas jupanakar pasäna uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
I really don’t know.	Chiqpachansa janiw yatkti.
I'm doing something wrong, but I'm not sure where.	Jan walinak luraskta, ukampis kawkhansa uk janiw sum yatkti.
You think .	Jumax amuyta .
Very poisonous, very.	Wali suma, wali.
But no, this is better.	Ukampis janiw, akax jukʼamp askiwa.
I don't see why not.	Kunatsa jan ukhamäki uk janiw uñjkti.
He didn't want to say no.	Jupajj janiw sañ munkänti.
I have done the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw lurawayta.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
More immediately he ordered himself.	Jukʼamp jankʼakiw jupa pachpaw mayïna.
He doesn’t know it yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax uk yatkiti.
I was really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
There is a need to do it.	Kuna lurañas wakisi.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
You are so good to me.	Jumax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I don’t know where it is.	Janiw kawkhans uk yatkti.
And that’s why he’s going there.	Ukat ukatwa jupax uka chiqar saraski.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
It’s really worth it!.	¡Chiqpachansa wali askiwa!.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t know how seriously.	Janiw yatkti kunjams sinti jach’a.
He’s excited about this though.	Jupax aka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi ukampis.
He’s still in pain.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
It felt good immediately.	Ukajj jankʼakiw sum jikjjatasïna.
And that was it.	Ukat ukax ukhamänwa.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
He just did it right away.	Jupajj ukhamakiw luräna.
No one said anything to me.	Janiw khitis nayarojj kuns siskänti.
I didn't understand anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns amuykayätti.
Or it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas utjkaspati.
I don't believe that.	Nayajj janiw ukham creykti.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
Not about that.	Janiw uka tuqitxa.
It’s a very nice guy.	Wali suma jaqiwa.
He said it to himself.	Jupa pachpaw säna.
This is what it is now.	Akax jichhax ukhamawa.
But he didn't say anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns siskänti.
It wasn't necessary.	Janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
I’ve seen this many times.	Nayax walja kutiw uk uñjta.
He knew what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk sum yatïna.
He’ll do it soon.	Jupax niyaw ukham lurani.
And he didn’t do that.	Ukat janiw ukham lurkänti.
But you know the kind.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa uka kasta.
But he knew it all too well.	Ukampis jupajj uk sum yatïna.
He’s a really nice guy.	Chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
Something needs to be done.	Kunas lurañax wakisi.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
Or whatever you need to do.	Jan ukajj kuna lurañas wakisispati.
A thing of the past.	Mä kuna.
You are better off.	Jumajj jukʼamp askiwa.
I wasn't really sure.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun sum yatkayätti.
I never quite understood why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janipuniw sum amuykayätti.
I didn’t want to see him.	Janiw jupar uñjañ munkayätti.
He loved it all so much.	Jupajj taqe ukanak wal munäna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I mean this for sure.	Nayax akax chiqpachapuniw sañ munta.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
And he was like that.	Ukat jupajj ukhamänwa.
I know.	Yattwa.
Maybe it's worth it.	Inas ukajj wakischispa.
It doesn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
But that wasn't necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Janiw kunas pasani uk yatkti.
I don’t know why, but it was.	Kunatsa uk janiw yatkti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
You know and it’s called.	Jumax yatisktawa ukat ukax satawa.
I told him so.	Nayajj ukhamwa jupar sista.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
You’re not like that.	Jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurañ munta.
Something happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna.
This will be about the first year.	Ukajj niya nayrïr maraw pasani.
But you know what, it’s worth it.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa kunas, ukax wali askiwa.
I didn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkayätti.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
What's the matter with it.	Kunas uka tuqitxa.
He meant to say that.	Jupajj uk sañ munäna.
I know that's a good thing.	Nayajj uk sum yatta.
And he felt the same way.	Ukat jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasïna.
So we are the same.	Ukhamajj jiwasajj ukhamarakiw.
He knew better than that.	Jupajj uka toqet jukʼamp sum yatïna.
I don’t want to do this.	Nayax janiw aka tuqit lurañ munkti.

That's what I realized.	Ukaw nayarojj amuyasïna.

I know how that feels.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk nayajj yattwa.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Jan ukax khitirus, uka tuqitxa.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw uk lurañ munkti.
And he .	Ukat jupax .
He said it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk säna.
He immediately said no.	Jupajj jankʼakiw janiw sasaw säna.
What will he do with it.	¿Kunsa jupajj lurani.
I think, actually, that’s good.	Nayax amuyta, chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa.
I think you’re right.	Nayax jumax ukham amuyta.
In both cases.	Pä tuqitxa.
This one did that.	Akax ukham luratayna.

That is not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It didn't do that.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
And that’s a good thing.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa.
I think it’s true.	Chiqpachansa sasaw amuyasta.
I didn’t want that, but it was.	Janiw uk munkayätti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
It always was, and it always will be.	Nayratpach ukhamänwa, ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
Nothing about that.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
So he went away.	Ukatwa jupajj sarjjäna.
There is no such thing now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham utjkiti.
That's what makes me feel so good.	Ukaw wal sum jikjjatasta.

He thought something would happen.	Kunas pasani sasaw amuyäna.
There is nothing you can do.	Janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti.
But there is no other option.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
He had no idea how long.	Jupax janiw qhawqha tiempos uk amuykänti.
He was the one who started it.	Jupaw uka qalltäna.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Inas mä juk’a, inas walja.

Do you know what it is.	¿Kunsa uk yattati.
He knew I would never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkäti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
This is obviously not the case.	Ukax qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
No one knows how it will turn out.	Kunjamsa ukajj utjani uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That happened a lot.	Ukajj walpun pasäna.
He never hurt anyone.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus jan walinak lurkänti.
It certainly wasn’t for me.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix ukhamäkänti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I have no idea how he felt, or why.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasïna, jan ukajj kunatsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw amuykti.
He told me he didn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkti sasaw sitäna.

There was no one there that night.	Uka arumax janiw khitis utjkänti.
Or anyone for that matter.	Jan ukax khitirus uka tuqitxa.

You can easily do this at home.	Utan jankʼakiw uk lurasma.
And that’s a good thing.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa.
There was never anything there, on my part.	Janipuniw kunas ukanx utjkänti, nayan tuqitxa.

And everything is just that.	Ukat taqi kunas ukhamakiw.

I don’t want that.	Janiw nayax uk munkti.
No one was there for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
He did what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luräna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkäti.
He was saying it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk siskäna.

And I realized what he was doing.	Ukat kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk amuyayäta.

No one told him.	Janiw khitis jupar siskänti.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Jupajj uka toqet jumamp parlañ muni.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

You can do that.	Ukham lurasma.
There is nothing else like it.	Janiw kunas yaqha ukham utjkiti.
But there was no one there.	Ukampis janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
But he knew it himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpaw uk yatïna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
But something else just happened.	Ukampis yaqha kunas ukhamakiw pasäna.
He’s still alone.	Jupax wali sapakiw jikxatasi.
It just went away.	Ukajj ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
I have nothing of my own.	Nayajj janiw kunas nayajj utjkituti.
¡There is nothing!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti!.
I don't know why that didn't happen.	Kunatsa ukham jan paskäna uk janiw yatkti.

That's what he said.	Ukhamaw jupajj säna.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.
But there is no time.	Ukampis janiw tiempojj utjkiti.
He understood what that meant to me.	Ukajj kunsa nayatakejj sañ munäna uk jupajj sum amuyäna.
He knows now, at least.	Jupax jichhax yati, mä juk’a.
A man can do much worse.	Mä chachajj jukʼamp jan walinak luraspa.
It was a long time though.	Wali jaya tiempos ukhamänwa.
But it doesn’t mean that.	Ukampis janiw sañ munkiti.
I thought that was not unlikely.	Ukajj janiw jan ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyayäta.
You know what it is.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas uk.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
There is nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkiti.
I didn't really want to talk to him now.	Jichhajj janiw cheqpachapun jupamp parlañ munkayätti.
You understand that perfectly.	Jumax uk sum amuyta.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
So it's not really like that.	Ukhamajj janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkiti.
But he didn't want anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns munkänti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

That’s how it feels.	Ukhamaw jikxatasi.
Of course he knew it.	Chiqpachansa jupax uk yatïna.
I really didn’t need to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
What's the.	Kunas uka.
I thought it would all come down to me.	Taqe kunas nayaruw purini sasaw amuyayäta.
He knew what he meant, but he didn't say it.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna, ukampis janiw uk siskänti.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.
And that’s exactly what it’s about.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
I’ve been wanting to do one for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw mä lurañ munta.
And you can do it yourself.	Ukat juma pachpaw lurasma.
He never said that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk siskänti.
And it doesn’t exist in any other country.	Ukat janiw yaqha markan utjkiti.

But here's the thing.	Ukampis aka.

He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.

No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He was a very happy guy.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
There is no reason to do so.	Janiw kunatsa ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Himself or me.	Jupa pachpa jan ukax naya.
So that’s what he did.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj luräna.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
How long did it take.	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasäna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
He needs to do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa lurañapa.
I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I don't want to talk about it.	Janiw uka toqet parlañ munkti.
He lives here.	Jupax akan jakasi.
But I don’t think he’ll do much here.	Ukampis janiw nayax akan wal lurani siskti.
They have nothing to do with me.	Jupanakax janiw kunas nayatakix utjkiti.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
No, he’s not like that.	Janiwa, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
You’re welcome!.	¡Jumax wali askiwa!.
And it happened several times, one way or another.	Ukat walja kutiw ukham pasäna, mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqit.

He didn’t quite know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk sum yatkänti.

You know what, no.	Jumax yatisktawa kuna, janiwa.
And there’s nothing you need to do.	Ukat janiw kunas lurañax wakiskiti.

That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
And he didn't want to do that.	Ukat janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
But it seems that this is not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
But he could do nothing about it.	Ukampis uka toqet janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
He's a great guy.	Jupax jach'a jaqiwa.
I'm not going to do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurkäti.
I’m happy to be here.	Nayax kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I didn’t want to see him like that.	Janiw jupar ukham uñjañ munkayätti.
I want to make it work.	Nayajj ukanak sum lurañwa munta.
But that doesn't mean it's impossible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti sañ munkiti.
I really don’t mean that.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax ukham sañ munkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't want you.	Jupajj janiw jumar munkiti.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
But no one understood.	Ukampis janiw khitis amuykänti.
He knew the language well.	Jupajj uka aru sum yatïna.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj wal munäna.
It’s really worth doing.	Chiqpachansa uka lurañax wali askiwa.
I did it and it worked.	Nayax uk lurawayta ukat wali askiwa.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m sorry it has to be done.	Nayax llakistwa ukax lurañaw wakisi.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nayajj janiw sasaw sista.

He wanted it to be so.	Jupajj ukhamwa munäna.
And you can’t have that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukax utjkaspati.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
That was what he felt comfortable with.	Ukaw jupajj sum jikjjatasïna.
You’re great !.	Jumax jach’a !.
I’ve seen it all.	Nayax taqpach uñjta.
I want to know how to do it.	Nayax kunjams lurañax uk yatiñ munta.
You don’t need the money.	Janiw qullqix wakiskiti.
But, he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis, janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
It happened many times.	Walja kutiw ukham pasäna.
I was so happy to see him.	Jupar uñjasajj walpun kusista.
There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
And it happened again.	Ukat wasitatwa pasäna.
You’re welcome to this.	Jumax akax wali askiwa.
He told me that he was.	Jupajj sasaw sitäna.
It was a slow motion.	Ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurkäti.
But that’s exactly the point.	Ukampis ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
I have seen this happen many times.	Walja kutiw ukham luraskäna uk uñjta.
That was what that meant.	Ukajj ukajj kuntï sañ munkäna ukhamänwa.
There was no one there.	Janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
He has to do everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqi kun lurañapa.
And he meant well, he knew.	Ukat jupajj sum sañ munäna, uk sum yatïna.
He said it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.
Also, the character.	Ukhamaraki.
And that’s exactly what happened.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.
And you should do the same.	Ukat jumajj ukhamarakiw lurañama.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
Never a negative word, ever.	Janipuniw mä jan wali aru, janipuniw.
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
But there was no one.	Ukampis janiw khitis utjkänti.
That’s saying something.	Ukax mä kuns sañ muni.
I’ve seen it well.	Uk sum uñjta.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Janiw kuns sañ munkayätti.
I understand that.	Nayax uk amuyasta.

I hope to use it one day.	Mä urux apnaqañ suyt’askta.
Or anyone, really.	Jan ukax khitis, chiqpachansa.

That’s the reason.	Ukax kunatsa.
Who said the best so far, but now yourself.	Khitis jichhakamax wali suma säna, ukampis jichhax juma pachpa.
But he didn't understand.	Ukampis janiw jupajj amuykänti.
It used to be one.	Nayrajj mä ukhamänwa.
But now now.	Ukampis jichhajj jichhajj.
He had never done this before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurkänti.
It feels like this for no reason.	Jan kunatsa ukham amuyasi.
I need more time.	Nayajj jukʼamp tiempow munasi.
He really didn’t know what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
You say so yourself.	Juma pachpaw ukham sista.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
But no, there is nothing.	Ukampis janiw, janiw kunas utjkiti.
That’s where it’s at.	Ukax kawkhans utji.
You should always do this.	Sapa kutiw uk lurañama.
No one wants to talk.	Janiw khitis parlañ munkiti.
He was the one who saw it.	Jupaw uk uñjäna.
And that was it.	Ukat ukax ukhamänwa.

I don’t want to do anything about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munkti.
Many times before.	Walja kutiw nayrax.
He’s a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s how it feels.	Ukhamaw jikxatasi.
I had no idea what had happened or why.	Kunas pasäna, kunatsa pasäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
He obviously did.	Jupax qhanaw ukham luratayna.
He said you know.	Jupax yatisktawa sasaw säna.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
He was alone, he had always been.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna, nayrax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïna.
He is a good guy.	Jupajj suma jaqewa.
But I don't believe that.	Ukampis janiw uk creykti.
It’s not impossible to do.	Janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He had no idea what was going on.	Jupajj janiw kunas paskäna uk amuykänti.
I don't know why.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
What! 	Kuna!
He was clearly aware.	Jupajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I assured him he would do well.	Jupajj wali sumwa lurani sasaw sista.
I want to be like that.	Nayax ukham munta.
I didn't know why.	Kunatsa uk janiw yatkayätti.
He was the only one who did it.	Jupa sapakiw ukham luräna.
He was the only one who thought.	Jupa sapakiw amuyäna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
You know that, but you don’t.	Jumax uk yatisktawa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But I'm pretty sure there isn't.	Ukampis janiw utjkiti sasaw wal yatta.
You have to do this every time.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurañama.
He said that every year.	Sapa maraw ukham säna.
He couldn't control it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak apnaqañ puedkänti.
And that’s why.	Ukat ukax kunatsa.
That's what I said.	Ukham sasaw sista.
It was doing just fine.	Ukajj wali sum luraskäna.
And that’s really what he never had.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa jupax janipuniw utjkänti.
But this was no different.	Ukampis ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
There’s nothing like that.	Janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
I felt the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw amuyayäta.
I highly doubt that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun pächasta.
That is not the case today.	Jichhürunakanjja janiw ukhamäkiti.
On the one hand, it kind of is.	Mä tuqitxa, mä kasta ukhamawa.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn’t know anything.	Jupax janiw kuns yatkiti.
Therefore it exists, the .	Ukatwa ukham utji, uka .
I know what is in store for me.	Kunas nayatakejj utjani uk sum yatta.
I understand that perfectly.	Nayax uk sum amuyta.
And that is unique.	Ukat ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
Or so it will happen.	Jan ukajj ukham pasani.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He told me that.	Jupaw ukham sitäna.
Actually, that’s what it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamawa.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
There will be a tomorrow.	Mä qharüruw utjani.
That's what he told me.	Ukhamaw jupajj sitäna.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
And that is what he did.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj luräna.
I know it did that for me.	Nayatakix ukham luratayna uk yattwa.
I didn't know that.	Nayajj janiw uk yatkayätti.
But not now, not now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj utjkiti, janiw jichhajj utjkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He really understood.	Jupajj cheqapuniw amuyäna.
I’m still doing that.	Nayax wali ukham luraskta.
We are	Jiwasax .
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
That's what he said.	Ukham sasaw jupajj säna.
I don’t want to say it.	Nayax janiw sañ munkti.
I’m so sorry about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
It just happened to happen.	Ukax ukhamakiw pasäna.
But he’s good to me.	Ukampis jupax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
Everything.	Taqi.
But that doesn't mean anything.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
It’s time to do it.	Ukax lurañ pachaw purini.
He wants to go.	Jupax sarañ muni.
I know that's what he thinks.	Ukhamwa jupajj amuyi uk sum yatta.
I saw it happen first hand.	Uka lurañ uñjañ nayraqat uñjta.

Everyone except me.	Taqinipuniw jan ukax nayat sipansa.
It felt strange in itself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw muspharkañ amuyasïna.
This was quite obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw jikjjatasïna.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It may never exist.	Inas janipuniw utjkaspati.
Now I need it every day.	Jichhax sapa uruw ukax wakisi.
It’s been a long time coming.	Jaya pachaw ukax wakisi.
But he was still in a state of shock.	Ukampis jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
A construction site.	Mä lurañ uta.
He had nothing to do.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
That happened a little bit.	Ukajj mä jukʼa pasäna.
It’s going to happen.	Ukhamaw pasani.
I haven’t seen them.	Nayax janiw jupanakar uñjkti.

All well and good.	Taqi kunas wali suma ukat suma.

Something wrong, too.	Kunas jan wali, ukhamaraki.
He didn't know exactly.	Jupajj janiw sum yatkänti.
And he knew it well.	Ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
So I wasn't sure why.	Ukhamajj kunatsa ukham sista uk janiw sum yatkayätti.

But that was the first time he saw her.	Ukampis uka uruw nayrïr kuti uñjäna.
But no, he wasn't.	Ukampis janiw, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want to go anywhere.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus sarañ munkänti.
It doesn't matter if it will do him any good.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, ukajj jupar sum lurani.
I’m doing pretty good.	Nayax wali sum luraskta.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

But he knew it all too well.	Ukampis jupajj uk sum yatïna.
And very quickly.	Ukat wali jankʼakiw.

I have no idea what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw amuykti.
He didn't want to see anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns uñjañ munkänti.

You are a completely different person.	Jumax taqpach yaqha jaqiwa.

I have no idea how he will react to it.	Kunjamsa jupajj uka toqet lurani uk janiw amuykti.

He certainly did, he said.	Chiqpachansa uk luräna, sasaw säna.

But that is not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
I feel like he is great.	Jupajj jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
He’s a human being.	Jupax jaqiwa.
He said he knew.	Jupax yattwa sasaw säna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.

He’ll arrive tomorrow.	Jupax qharüruw purini.
He went there immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka cheqar saräna.

On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.

That's what he did.	Ukhamwa jupajj luräna.

And there was no time.	Ukat janiw tiempojj utjkänti.
He started over two more times.	Jupajj jukʼamp pä kutiw wasitat qalltäna.

But, it wasn’t.	Ukampis, ukhamänwa.
I didn’t tell him that.	Janiw nayax jupar ukham siskti.

He loved her so much.	Jupajj walpun jupar munäna.

And it’s not.	Ukat janiw.
There’s nothing like that.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañax utjkiti.

I understood his feelings.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum amuyayäta.

He’s a good guy, too.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, ukhamaraki.

I’m pretty excited about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

I think it’s really good for me.	Nayax amuyta, chiqpachans nayatakix wali askiwa.
I don’t say anything.	Janiw kuns siskti.
I totally understand that.	Nayax uk taqpach amuyta.
I think he did that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukham luratayna.
He told me he was fine and very happy.	Jupax wali suma ukat wali kusisitaw jikxatasi sasaw sitäna.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk lurañama.
There is no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti.

It’s just so great.	Ukax ukhamakiw wali jach’a.
He really wanted to talk to her today.	Jichhürunakan jupamp parltʼañ wal munäna.
I need help immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw yanaptʼa munta.
He wasn't really like that.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkänti.

He obviously thought so.	Jupajj qhanaw ukham amuyäna.
He saw a really good one.	Jupajj cheqapuniw mä sum uñjäna.

I am really looking forward to it.	Chiqpachansa wali suytʼaskta.

And, it really isn’t.	Ukat, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t remember where.	Janiw kawkhans amtaskti.
Honestly, I think that’s a good thing.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
And he didn't want to go.	Ukat janiw sarañ munkänti.

So he did well.	Ukhamajj jupajj sumwa luräna.
But there was no one.	Ukampis janiw khitis utjkänti.
And that’s a good thing.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa.
He understood her feelings in every way.	Jupajj taqe toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sumwa amuyäna.

That is what he wants to do.	Ukaw jupajj lurañ muni.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he was very cautious.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
I didn’t know what to do.	Janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
No one knows who he did it with.	Janiw khitis khitimpis lurkäna uk yatkiti.

But this is not a quick fix.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jankʼak lurañjamäkiti.

There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
He knows how to do everything.	Jupax taqi kuns lurañ yati.

But that's just the way it is.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamakiw.
I don’t plan on doing anything.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañ amtaskti.

He said he didn't know much about it.	Janiw uka tuqit sinti yatkiti sasaw säna.
He seemed to be a nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He is making sure that doesn't happen.	Jupajj jan ukham lurañapatakiw luraski.

That just happened to me.	Ukajj nayarojj ukhamakiw pasäna.

He is a very happy person.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
But I didn't think he would do much about it.	Ukampis uka toqet wal lurani sasin janiw amuyirïkti.
He didn't want to say anything to her.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupar sañ munkänti.
Money, money, money.	Qullqi, qullqi, qullqi.
This has not always been the case.	Ukajj janiw nayratpach ukhamäkänti.

He says it’s good to go now.	Jichhax sarañax wali askiwa sasaw saraki.
I didn't really understand what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw sum amuykayätti.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
He told me what he wanted.	Jupaw kuntï munkäna uk sitäna.
You don’t have one.	Jumax janiw mä juk’a.

He had nothing to say about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns sañ munkänti.
There’s nothing like that.	Janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
But the timing is worth it.	Ukampis uka tiempojj wali askiwa.
No, it’s not a good thing.	Janiwa, janiw kunas askïkiti.
He wanted it.	Jupajj uk munäna.
I want to know what I am doing.	Kunsa luraskta uk yatiñ munta.

It’s worth the money.	Ukax qullqix wali askiwa.
No, he meant to say.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj sañ munäna.

Many times he’s been very successful.	Walja kutiw jupax wali sum sarnaqäna.

He wanted to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañsa munäna.

And he says no.	Ukat jupax janiw sasaw saraki.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Janiw ukax askïkiti.
It doesn’t matter to me one way or the other.	Nayatakix janiw kunas mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqitxa.

He didn't want anyone to drink.	Jupajj janiw khitirus umañ munkänti.
I would definitely stay here again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wasitat akan qhiparañ munta.
I don’t like that.	Janiw ukax gustkituti.

But he didn't do these things.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurkänti.
I’m sorry for the inconvenience.	Nayax llakistwa.
But there was nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkänti.
It’s not what you think it is.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.

He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
He did very, very well.	Jupajj wali, wali sumwa luräna.
And that’s what it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamawa.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.

And he did it again.	Ukat wasitatwa uk luräna.
He’s a different person.	Jupax yaqha jaqiwa.

It’s not that impossible.	Janiw ukham jan lurañjamäkiti.
It’s not very useful.	Janiw sinti askïkiti.
I had no idea he could do that.	Ukham luraspa sasin janiw amuykayätti.
He said he couldn’t do it.	Jupax janiw uk lurañjamäkiti sasaw säna.
I don’t need it.	Nayax janiw wakiskiti.
And, of course, that’s it.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamawa.

But he was faster.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.

And, somehow, it actually worked.	Ukat, kunjamatsa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.

But he wasn't quite sure.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sum amuyaskänti.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
But these things happened.	Ukampis ukanak lurañaw pasäna.

No, of course not.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s never without it.	Jupax janipuniw jan ukax utjkiti.

Somehow he knew that.	Kunjamatsa jupax uk yatïna.

I mean that with caution.	Nayax ukax wali amuyumpiw sañ munta.
Or you can do both.	Jan ukajj panpachaniw lurasma.

Maybe you should do the same.	Inas jumax ukham lurañax wakischispa.

But it wasn't, he wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

You always do that.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham lurasma.

He has to do something.	Jupaw kuns lurañapa.
I had never thought of it that way before.	Nayrajj janiw ukham amuyirïkti.
Of course, he said.	Chiqpachansa, sasaw säna.

He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.

In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.

You don’t have to do this alone.	Janiw jumanakax sapak uk lurañax wakiskiti.

This was the case.	Akax ukhamänwa.
Really.	Chiqpachansa.
Not really that much.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
Doesn't mean it's a bad thing though.	Janiw ukax jan wali sañ munkiti ukampis.
And he looked at them.	Ukat jupanakar uñjäna.

He knew what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna.
I didn’t tell him why.	Kunatsa uk janiw jupar siskti.

But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He was feeling sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That's even better.	Ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t know exactly what it is.	Janiw kunas uk sum yatkti.
He’s doing very well.	Jupax wali sum luraski.

Now I say that to myself.	Jichhajj naya pachpaw ukham sista.
He really didn’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkänti.
So the reason for this was definitely not financial.	Ukhamajj kunatsa ukajj cheqpachapun janiw qollqe toqet utjkänti.
That's what you know.	Ukajj jumajj yatisktawa.
I don’t think so.	Nayax janiw ukham amuyta.

Well it’s not like that.	Suma janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think, maybe.	Nayax amuyta, inas.

That’s just how it is.	Ukax ukhamakiw utji.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.

This is not something that can be done.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
This is not impossible.	Ukax janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.

That’s just the way it is.	Ukax ukhamakiw.

He did this three times.	Kimsa kutiw ukham luräna.
He started it all.	Jupaw taqe kun qalltäna.
Why, of course.	Kunatsa, chiqpachansa.
He said that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.

There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
But no one said anything.	Ukampis janiw khitis kuns siskänti.
I said it wasn’t.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw sista.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
But somehow he didn't notice.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw amuyaskänti.
He, he, he.	Jupa, jupa, jupa.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He certainly didn't.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jan ukham lurkänti.

And, of course, that night.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, uka arumax.

He had no immediate comment.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak kuns siskänti.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
He was very curious.	Jupajj wal yatiñ munäna.

He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.

They are not good for anyone.	Jupanakax janiw khitirus askïkiti.

He didn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.

But so what?.	Ukampis ukhamajj ¿kunsa?.
Everything.	Taqi.
But he never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkänti.

I know what the cost is.	Nayax yattwa kunas qullqix utji.

I really didn’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkayätti.

I really don’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkti.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.

I'm feeling pretty good.	Nayajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
That’s what it’s about, really.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
But that’s not really the case.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
He was never like that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.

I am happier about it.	Uka tuqitxa jukʼamp kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I didn’t want to know, not really.	Janiw yatiñ munkayätti, janiw chiqpachansa.
It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
He went on his own.	Jupa pachpaw saräna.
And what's not.	Ukat kunas jan ukax.

It’s not like that with me.	Nayampejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
You’re the one who thinks so.	Jumax ukham amuyta.
I don’t want a character.	Janiw mä chachar munkti.

Everything is just that.	Taqi kunas ukhamakiw.
But obviously he was.	Ukampis qhanaw jupajj ukhamänwa.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was no one.	Janiw khitis utjkänti.
He did everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe kun luräna.

So I want to know about that.	Ukhamajj uka toqet yatiñ munta.
There is no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti.

He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn't want to tell him that.	Nayajj janiw jupar ukham yatiyañ munkayätti.
That’s good, of course.	Ukax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
He does not know in advance what he is doing.	Kuntï luraski uk janiw nayratpach yatkiti.

There’s work to be done.	Ukanx lurañaw utji.

He walked with her.	Jupax jupamp chikaw sarnaqäna.

Or somehow, he understood what she was saying.	Jan ukajj kunjamatsa, kuntï siskäna ukajj jupajj amuyäna.

That didn't mean he would.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurani sañ munkänti.

That’s also what he did.	Ukhamarakiw jupax ukham lurawayi.
And it’s now or never.	Ukat jichhax jan ukax janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
He knows what he is doing and why.	Kunsa luraski ukat kunatsa uk sum yati.

But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis janiw ukajj ukhamäkänti.
There is no one.	Janiw khitis utjkiti.
That's what he said.	Ukaw jupajj säna.

That is what he meant.	Ukaw jupajj sañ munäna.
I don't know exactly how he feels about me.	Kunjamsa nayat jikjjatasi uk janiw sum yatkti.
I feel like that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyasta.
But he obviously didn't.	Ukampis qhanaw jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
Or so he said.	Jan ukajj ukham säna.
And now he thought the day had definitely arrived.	Ukat jichhax uka urux chiqpachapuniw purini sasaw amuyäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't know much about anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa wal yatkiti.
He said there wasn’t.	Jupax janiw utjkiti sasaw säna.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax luräna.
He’s very good to me.	Jupax nayatakix wali askiwa.
There was no need to do that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.

That is what you have to do.	Ukaw jumajj lurañama.

There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.

I didn't know why.	Kunatsa uk janiw yatkayätti.
Or who actually did something.	Jan ukajj khitis cheqpachapun kuns luräna.
He will need help tomorrow.	Jupajj qharüruw yanaptʼa munasini.
He knows exactly where he is going.	Jupajj kawkirus saraski uk sum yati.
So it just went away.	Ukhamajj ukhamakiw sarjjäna.

He seemed to be someone else.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He’s still in pain.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.

If he however wanted to.	Jupajj ukampis munäna ukhajja.

He did it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk luräna.

And he definitely knows it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw uk yati.
I don't know too much about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sinti sum yatkti.

He wanted to make it awesome, now.	Jupax wali muspharkañ lurañ munäna, jichhax.
This was obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
He wanted me here.	Jupajj nayaruw akan munäna.
He told me that once.	Jupajj mä kutiw ukham sitäna.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
And two of these.	Ukat pä uka.
I’m so glad he’s doing so well.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jupax ukham sum luraski.
He wants to do more.	Jupajj jukʼamp lurañwa muni.

This is not something you can do.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
But he is not like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
I never believed them.	Janipuniw jupanakar creykti.
He was obviously devastated.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
You don’t even have to do these things properly.	Janiw ukanak sum lurañas wakiskiti.

And never again.	Ukat janipuniw mayampsa.

He said he didn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It was really painful.	Chiqpachansa wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.

There is no need to rush it.	Janiw jankʼak lurañajj wakiskiti.

But it turns out that wasn't the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw amuyasi.
But he didn't want to.	Ukampis janiw uk munkänti.
He told me himself.	Jupa pachpaw sitäna.
That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
And better yet good.	Ukat juk’amp askiwa suma.

He wasn't sure how it happened, but he knew it happened.	Kunjamsa pasäna uk janiw sum yatkänti, ukampis ukajj pasäna uk sum yatïna.
It feels long, of course.	Ukax jaya pachaw jikxatasi, chiqpachansa.

And he felt the same way.	Ukat jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasïna.

But there is nothing beyond that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa janiw kunas utjkiti.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.

It went many, many times.	Ukajj walja, walja kutiw saräna.
I asked myself again.	sasaw mayamp jisktʼasta.
And that’s it.	Ukat ukax.
He was happy and happy.	Jupajj kusisit kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Boy is he always.	Waynax jupax sapa kutiw.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukham amuyasïna.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
But he refused to go.	Ukampis janiw sarañ munkänti.
I'm not sure.	Nayax yattwa.
But he never thought of it that way.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham amuykänti.
I saw what he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munkäna uk uñjta.
I love doing these things.	Ukanak lurañax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Something is happening, and already.	Kunas pasaski, ukat niyaw.
He understood her well.	Jupajj jupar sum amuyäna.
But he couldn't say anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns sañ puedkänti.
Now I know what to do.	Jichhajj kun lurañsa yattwa.
It really means a lot.	Chiqpachansa walpun sañ muni.
He never said anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns siskänti.
And that's a good thing.	Ukat ukajj wali askiwa.
That was the case for me.	Nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
That’s what he wants.	Ukaw jupajj munki.
And he was like that.	Ukat jupax ukhamänwa.
Everything feels real.	Taqi kunas chiqpachapuniw jikxatasi.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas utjkaspati.
It’s available in the middle of the day.	Ukax chika uruw utji.
So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
Where will the money be.	Kawkhans qullqix utjani.
There is still work to be done.	Wali lurañaw wakisi.
That is not the case now.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
No one said much.	Janiw khitis sinti siskänti.
I don't want to drink.	Nayajj janiw umañ munkti.
I want nothing to do with it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet mä jukʼa lurañ munkti.
Maybe in another way.	Inas yaqha tuqitxa.
I would love to see that.	Uk uñjañ wal munta.
But that is our coffee.	Ukampis ukajj jiwasan café satawa.
That's what he knew.	Ukhamaw jupajj yatïna.
That’s one of the things.	Ukax mä tuqitxa.
Our	Jiwasan .
I know how that feels.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
A new school.	Mä machaq yatiqañ uta.
He had no idea what was going on here.	Jupajj kunas akan pasaski uk janiw amuykänti.
Now he thought he could.	Jichhajj ukham luraspa sasaw amuyasïna.
We don’t have that yet.	Jiwasax janiw ukax jichhakamax utjkiti.
But he didn't know what to do.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
He didn't say that.	Jupajj janiw ukham siskänti.
He’s not like that, never.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
There is a slight .	Ukax mä juk'a .
One good, three bad.	Mä suma, kimsa jan wali.
I know what’s going on.	Kunas pasaski uk yattwa.
I don't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
I don't know how to say it.	Janiw kunjamsa uk sañ yatkti.
He had done this before.	Jupajj nayrajj ukhamwa luratayna.
This is impossible to do.	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
I didn't do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurkti.
So that's not there.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw ukan utjkiti.
He wanted to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa munäna.
I don't want to talk about it any more.	Janiw jukʼamp uka toqet parlañ munkti.
Doesn’t mean he didn’t.	Janiw jupax jan lurkänti sañ munkiti.
What do you think?.	¿Kunsa jumajj amuyta?.
I didn't know what to say to him.	Nayajj janiw kunsa jupar sañ yatkayätti.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
He is doing very well now.	Jichhajj wali sumwa luraski.
He’s a.	Jupax mä.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But he did it, anyhow.	Ukampis jupax uk luräna, kunjamatsa.
And, and, and.	Ukat, ukat, ukat.
There is no	Janiw kuna .
He doesn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ munkiti.
Well the money is worth it.	Suma qullqix wali askiwa.
There is still work to be done.	Wali lurañaw wakisi.
Almost no one did.	Niya janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
This is not impossible.	Ukajj janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
You have no choice.	Jumax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I almost feel like I'm doing it myself.	Niya naya pachpaw uk luraskta ukham amuyasta.

¡I'm so excited!.	¡Nayajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta!.
I don’t quite know what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw taqpach yatkti.
I want to stay here.	Nayax akan qhiparañ munta.
I just can’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Maybe you can do that somehow.	Inas kunjamatsa ukham lurañax wakischispa.
Everyone has it.	Taqinipuniw ukax utji.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
But he couldn't speak.	Ukampis janiw parlañ puedkänti.
Or so it was.	Jan ukajj ukhamänwa.
There wasn’t much money.	Janiw sinti qullqi tuqit utjkänti.
I want to eat something.	Nayax mä manq’añ munta.
But he now saw clearly what he had to do.	Ukampis kuntï lurañapäkäna uk jichhajj sumwa uñjäna.
He doesn't like me.	Jupajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
I’m a little skeptical.	Nayax mä juk’a pächasta.
I don’t ever remember.	Janiw kunapachas amtaskti.
He likes her a lot.	Jupajj jupar wal gusti.
Who does he think he is.	Khitis jupajj amuyi.
That wasn’t the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
I don’t feel like I really want to.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapuni munkta ukham amuyasta.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkänti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He is a good guy.	Jupajj suma jaqewa.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
He planned it all first.	Jupaw nayraqat taqe ukanak amtäna.
I am very, very disappointed.	Nayax wali, wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He certainly is.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamawa.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
That just happened.	Ukajj jichhakiw pasäna.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
Everything is so happy there.	Taqi kunas ukanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
That’s pretty quick.	Ukax wali jank’akiw.
She knew that if she did, he knew how she felt.	Ukham luraspa ukhajja, kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk jupajj sum yati sasaw jupajj sum yatïna.
Now there’s none of that.	Jichhax janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
Now I know how to do it well.	Jichhajj sum lurañ yatta.
I didn’t know anything.	Nayax janiw kuns yatkayätti.
This lasted about three days.	Ukajj niya kimsa uruw pasäna.
he says, 'It's not.	sasaw saraki.
That’s what it is now.	Ukax jichhax ukhamawa.
No, he didn't mean that.	Janiwa, janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
I don't remember how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw amtaskti.
He’s nothing like that.	Jupax janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.
In this regard.	Aka tuqitxa.
But he knew it himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpaw uk yatïna.
That’s exactly what he wants.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax munki.
That’s what it is.	Ukax kunas.
It’s been a really long time actually.	Chiqpachansa wali jaya pachaw chiqpachansa.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
I asked him to do that.	Nayajj jupar ukham lurañapatakiw mayïna.
I’ve seen this many times.	Nayax walja kutiw uk uñjta.
And he did no more than that.	Ukat janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurkänti.
I repeat that again.	Nayajj wasitatwa ukham sista.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn’t want any more.	Janiw juk’amp munkiti.
But that's the way it is.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamawa.
I would love to see more.	Jukʼamp uñjañ wal munta.
There is no kind of action.	Janiw kuna kasta lurañas utjkiti.
But that is not the case with us.	Ukampis janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkiti.
Tear.	Jach'a.
And it really isn’t.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't have anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
I knew exactly what he was doing.	Kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
Or the first time, really.	Jan ukax nayrïr kuti, chiqpachansa.
It’s really not very good.	Chiqpachansa janiw wali askïkiti.
Even the whole word.	Nayraqat taqpach aru.
It’s location, location, location.	Ukax kawkhans utji, kawkhans jikxatasi, kawkhans jikxatasi.
He’s just doing it.	Jupax ukhamakiw luraski.
It wasn't like that before.	Nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
He will do so.	Ukham lurani.
Something needs to be done.	Kuns lurañaw wakisi.
He is and he isn’t.	Jupax ukhamawa ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to take care of this.	Nayax aka tuqit sum uñjañ munta.
And so it went on.	Ukat ukham sarnaqäna.
He seemed to be a nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He knew he would.	Ukham lurani uk jupajj sum yatïna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was absolutely right.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw säna.
He said he wanted to go home.	Utar sarañ munta sasaw säna.
Make yourself a drink.	Juma pachpaw mä umañ lurañama.
I am so glad he did.	Ukham luratapat wal kusista.
He’s very excited.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
So I never liked him.	Ukhamajj janipuniw jupar gustkituti.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s exactly what you get.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jikxatasi.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
You are the only one who knows how to control him.	Juma sapakiw jupar apnaqañ yatta.
You should do the same.	Jumax ukhamarakiw lurañama.
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
Not again, he thought.	Janiw mayampsa, sasaw amuyäna.
But nobody knows anything.	Ukampis janiw khitis kuns yatkiti.
But he was still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
The annual .	Ukax sapa maraw .
The who, what and why.	Uka khitis, kunas ukat kunatsa.
I’m still in love with it.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw jikxatastxa.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
He certainly knows this fact.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka cheq yati.
That wasn't there.	Ukajj janiw utjkänti.
It’s the only one.	Ukax sapakiw utji.
But there was nothing else to do.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
I just don't like it.	Nayajj janiw ukajj gustkituti.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw uk luräna.
I disagree with that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet iyaw siskti.
I know, he thought.	Nayax yattwa, sasaw amuyäna.
He was not what he wanted.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï munkäna ukhamäkänti.
And nothing to do about it.	Ukat janiw kuna lurañas uka tuqitxa.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He said he was happy.	Jupajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta sasaw säna.
I didn't want that.	Nayajj janiw uk munkayätti.
That we are.	Uka jiwasax.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Well, actually.	Suma, chiqpachansa.
And the reason I say that is absolutely true.	Ukat kunatsa ukham siskta ukax chiqpachapuniw sañ muni.
Faster, indeed.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼamp jankʼakiw.
He didn't mean it.	Jupajj janiw uk sañ munkänti.
I don't know why.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
That’s a little bit to say.	Ukax mä juk’a sañ muni.
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kun lurañsa yatkänti.
And what happened.	Ukat kunas pasäna.
And indeed it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
That’s what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj munäna.
But he was the same.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa.
I don't see how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw uñjkti.
But he seemed like such a great guy.	Ukampis jupajj ukham jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
That didn't last long.	Ukajj janiw jaya tiempojj utjkänti.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis lurañaw wakisi.
Is there such a thing?.	¿Ukham kunas utji?.
He doesn't know what he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk janiw yatkiti.
Didn't you	¿Janit jumax .
On the downside, maybe.	Uka jan wali tuqitxa, inas.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Or there was nothing.	Jan ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
He’s very excited.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
But there is nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkiti.
I am not sure about that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
He already knew that.	Jupax nayratpach uk yatïna.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
That’s how I understand what you’re saying.	Ukhamaw nayax kuntix jumax siskta uk amuyayäta.
For the first time he saw her properly.	Nayrïr kutiw jupar sum uñjäna.
But he did it.	Ukampis jupajj uk luräna.
I want to know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiñ munta.
And he didn’t do anything.	Ukat jupax janiw kuns lurkänti.
Hope to see you there!.	¡Ukan uñjañ suyt'askta!.
He just bought it here.	Jupax jichhakiw akan alasïna.
And he saw only one.	Ukat mä sapakiw uñjäna.
Or about everything else.	Jan ukajj taqe kunatsa.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I don’t think so.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never knew who it was.	Janipuniw khitis uk yatkayätti.
I am very conscious of that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun amuyasta.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
Here’s what that means.	Akax kunjams ukax sañ muni.
You of course.	Jumax chiqpachansa.
Now he could see me again.	Jichhajj wasitatwa nayar uñjañ yatïna.
It’s the first day of school.	Yatiqañ utan nayrïr uruw purini.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
But he doesn’t know why.	Ukampis jupax janiw kunatsa ukham luraski uk yatkiti.
But it never happens.	Ukampis janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
Almost no one knew, he said.	Niya janiw khitis yatkänti, sasaw jupajj säna.
He wants to know everything.	Jupajj taqe kun yatiñ muni.
He knew a lot about building.	Jupajj uta lurañ toqet wal yatïna.
I don’t know anything about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns yatkti.
Nothing, he was saying.	Janiw kunas, sasaw jupajj siskäna.
He’s doing better, you know.	Jupax juk’amp sum luraski, jumax yatisktawa.
And it wasn't necessary.	Ukat janiw ukajj wakiskänti.

He loved her so much.	Jupajj jupar wal munäna.
I didn’t want to see him.	Janiw jupar uñjañ munkayätti.
He didn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa sum yatkänti.
You’ve got to do it quickly.	Jumax jank’akiw lurañama.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

I think it’s worth it.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali askiwa.
There’s nothing for me.	Janiw kunas nayatakix utjkiti.
I’ve seen it the same way.	Nayax ukhamarakiw uñjta.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It was clear that he really wanted to go.	Chiqpachansa sarañ muni, ukax qhanaw amuyasïna.
He says he doesn’t.	Jupax janiw sasaw saraki.
He’s a human being.	Jupax jaqiwa.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
That’s how much time you have.	Ukhamaw qawqha tiempos utji.
I don't have much time.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkituti.
He wants to know what’s going on.	Kunas pasaski uk yatiñ muni.
I don’t really know.	Nayax janiw chiqpachansa yatkti.
But, for the first time, he understood it completely.	Ukampis, nayrïr kutiw taqpach amuyasïna.
Needless to say, but he’s a great guy.	Janiw sañ munkti, ukampis jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
But maybe that's really necessary.	Ukampis inas ukajj cheqpachapun wakischispa.
But that didn't make sense to me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayarojj amuykayätti.
I know how he is.	Nayajj kunjamsa jupajj uk yattwa.
I wish I could, but I don’t.	Nayax ukhamawa sañ munta, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I guess that is the point.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa sasaw amuyta.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
But he was .	Ukampis jupajj .
But I don’t think so.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuykti.
I never remembered it.	Janipuniw amtaskti.
He said he knew and he knew.	Jupax yattwa ukat yattwa sasaw säna.
He wants it.	Jupajj uk muni.

That’s what you need.	Ukaw wakisi.

It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.

That’s what happened here.	Ukaw akan pasäna.
He did nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kuns lurkänti.
And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
Nothing else did that.	Janiw kunas ukham lurkänti.
It wasn't necessary.	Janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
In this regard,.	Uka tuqitxa,...
It’s going to take a while.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw saraski.
And he meant it.	Ukat jupax uk sañ munäna.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I feel the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw ukham jikjjatasta.
And another one.	Ukat yaqha.
He wanted to do it .	Jupajj uk lurañwa munäna .
I don't believe that anymore.	Nayajj janiw uk jukʼamp creykti.
He wanted to do more.	Jupajj jukʼamp lurañwa munäna.
He’s a nice guy.	Jupax mä suma jaqiwa.

He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
I don't want to see them anymore.	Janiw jupanakar jukʼamp uñjañ munkti.
He said there wasn’t.	Jupax janiw utjkiti sasaw säna.
He wanted to go with me, he said.	Jupax nayamp chika sarañ munäna, sasaw säna.
But he could never do that.	Ukampis janipuniw uk lurañ puedkänti.
Or he didn't do that.	Jan ukajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
It’s better for me.	Nayatakix juk’amp askiwa.
We, we are good enough.	Jiwasax, jiwasax wali askiwa.
He says he didn’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurkti sasaw saraki.
He wanted it.	Jupajj uk munäna.
But that’s what happened.	Ukampis ukhamarakiw pasäna.
The first two things.	Nayrïr pä kuna.
And I know that’s not a good thing.	Ukat nayax yattwa ukax janiw wali askïkiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
That’s what I like right now.	Ukax nayatakix jichhax wali askiwa.
Or that.	Jan ukajj uka.
He didn't know how to do it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkänti.
He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
He had just left.	Jupajj jichhakiw sarjjäna.
I can see why you would.	Kunatsa ukham lurasma uk sum uñjta.
He still didn't understand.	Jupajj wali jan amuyaskänti.
I’m the only one who’s done it.	Naya sapakiw ukanak lurawayta.
Maybe it’s worth doing.	Inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.

That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
I’ve done something.	Nayax kuns lurawayta.
I don't know how long.	Janiw qawqha tiempos siskti.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ukajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
No, on the other hand.	Janiwa, yaqha tuqitxa.
I don't know why.	Janiw kunatsa yatkti.
He needed some help.	Jupajj mä jukʼa yanaptʼa munäna.
Good, good, he said.	Suma, suma, sasaw säna.
But he was in a hurry.	Ukampis jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
I was so happy with how it turned out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk uñjasajj walpun kusista.
What is the cause of this?.	¿Kunas ukham luraspa?.
Otherwise it is not.	Yaqha tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don't want to talk about it.	Janiw uka toqet parlañ munkti.
He certainly didn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkänti.
But I didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw nayajj ukham lurkänti.
There was never anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham utjkänti.
But who thinks so.	Ukampis khitis ukham amuyi.
But he was still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He didn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
He never said anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns siskänti.
There was never a need to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
That’s what he wanted more.	Ukhamaw jupax juk’amp munäna.
Something wasn’t clear.	Kunas janiw sum amuyaskänti.
He gave him the money.	Jupajj qollqe churäna.
Or the next day.	Jan ukax qhipürux.
I know that for myself.	Naya pachpaw uk yatta.
Or about three.	Jan ukajj niya kimsa.

I didn’t know about it before.	Nayax janiw nayrax uka tuqit yatkayätti.
Also, slowly.	Ukhamaraki, ukhamaraki.
That’s another thing entirely.	Ukax yaqha tuqit taqpach.
And he knows exactly what to do.	Ukat kunsa lurañapa uk sum yati.

And you know what you’re doing.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa.
¡That's what you need to do!.	¡Ukham lurañaw wakisi!.
But that doesn't mean doing nothing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jan kun lurañ sañ munkiti.
I don’t remember exactly that day.	Uka urux janiw sum amtaskti.
But that’s what it is.	Ukampis ukax ukhamawa.
They don't need to.	Janiw jupanakajj wakiskiti.
I like this one very much.	Nayatakix akax wali askiwa.
He did the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
I’ve been feeling it for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw jikxatasïna.
But it doesn't exist.	Ukampis janiw ukajj utjkiti.
It was like that for me.	Nayatakix ukhamänwa.
Many times in fact.	Walja kutiw chiqpachansa.
So it never happened.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
So far, it hasn’t worked.	Jichhakamax janiw ukax askïkiti.
I didn't understand.	Janiw nayajj amuykayätti.
In this regard, and.	Uka tuqitxa, ukat.
He didn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
I don’t think anyone really knows.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatkiti sasaw amuyta.
A bad one.	Mä jan wali.
That's what I thought.	Ukaw nayajj amuyayäta.
This is obviously not the case.	Ukajj qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
But you need to act quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw kuns lurañama.
That’s what it was like.	Ukhamaw ukhamänwa.
He’s doing exactly that.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham luraski.
And that’s what I like about it.	Ukat ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
That's what he told me.	Ukham sasaw sitäna.
And, why.	Ukat, kunatsa.
Time is moving fast.	Tiempojj jankʼakiw saraski.
I don’t know exactly what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw sum yatkti.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
No, not yet.	Janiwa, janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
He couldn't do them fast enough.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar jankʼak lurañ puedkänti.
He seemed to be a nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
That's what it means.	Ukham sañ muni.
No one did anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkänti.
No one told him.	Janiw khitis jupar siskänti.
I saw it again.	Nayax wasitat uñjta.
I don’t think I’m not.	Janiw nayax janiw siskti.
There is nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkiti.
He refused to tell her why.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa uk yatiyañ munkänti.
Nobody wants that.	Janiw khitis uk munkiti.
He knew all about it but couldn't tell anyone.	Jupajj taqe ukanak sum yatïna ukampis janiw khitirus yatiyañ puedkänti.
It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.
I didn't want to know any more.	Janiw jukʼamp yatiñ munkayätti.
He didn't want to talk, he didn't want to talk to anyone.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti, janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
He told me that.	Jupax ukham sasaw sitäna.
I think that’s it.	Nayax ukax ukhamawa sasaw amuyta.
I don’t know how to do it.	Janiw kunjams lurañ yatkti.
He moved to the area.	Jupajj uka cheqar sarjjäna.
That was the case.	Ukajj ukhamänwa.
He was the one who took care of it.	Jupaw uk sum uñjäna.
Or anyone else.	Jan ukax khitirus.
I don’t want to say that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkti.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
There’s nothing like that.	Janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
Or the other way around.	Jan ukajj yaqha tuqitxa.
It feels a lot like that.	Walja ukham jikxatasi.
This is not quite convincing.	Ukham lurasajj janiw sum iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Nothing has happened yet.	Janiw kunas jichhakamax utjkiti.
No one knows what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He wanted it.	Jupajj uk munäna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn't do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurkti.
He knew now that he had to.	Ukham lurañapäkäna uk jichhajj sum yatïna.
I don't like that at all.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj kunjamatsa gustkituti.
But he couldn't control it.	Ukampis janiw ukanak apnaqañ puedkänti.
That’s what you want, isn’t it.	Ukhamaw jumax munta, ¿janich ukhamäki.
You know the.	Jumax yatisktawa uka...
And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
But no one knows what will happen.	Ukampis kunas pasani uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I'm feeling pretty good.	Nayajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
I don’t know about this.	Nayax janiw aka tuqit yatkti.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He knew it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk yatïna.
I want to know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiñ munta.
I always feel that way.	Sapa kutiw ukham jikjjatasta.
I really don’t understand.	Chiqpachansa janiw amuykti.
Why.	Kunatsa.
I don't do that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham lurkti.
I don’t know how to say no.	Janiw kunjamatsa jan sañ yatkti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
You, it’s not like that.	Jumax, janiw ukhamäkiti.
So he went away.	Ukatwa jupajj saräna.
I never want to see him again.	Janipuniw mayamps jupar uñjañ munkti.
I know that's a good thing.	Nayajj uk sum yatta.
But it worked for me.	Ukampis nayatakix wali askiwa.
I felt better immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw sum jikjjatasta.
A little bit bigger.	Mä juk’amp jach’a.
But there was no one.	Ukampis janiw khitis utjkänti.
He really wanted her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar munäna.
There's a.	Ukax mä.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have seen it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk uñjta.
Anyway, that doesn't matter.	Kawkhansa, janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
I’m sorry about that but that doesn’t mean this is it.	Nayax ukat llakistwa ukampis janiw ukax akax sañ munkiti.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.
It wasn't the way it was supposed to be.	Janiw kunjamtï lurañapäkäna ukhamäkänti.
I am still happy to see that.	Uk uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He wants it, he wants it.	Jupax muni, jupax muni.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
There’s something about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunas utji.
But he was still in a state of shock.	Ukampis jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
He didn’t know what to say to her.	Janiw kuns jupar sañ yatkänti.
So he said he would never do that.	Ukatwa janipuniw ukham lurkäti sasaw säna.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I'm still enjoying it.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
But they’re worth it!.	Ukampis ¡jupanakax wali askiwa!.
That's what he did.	Ukajj jupaw luräna.
Very good indeed.	Wali suma chiqpachansa.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't have a he.	Jupajj janiw mä jupajj utjkänti.
I don’t drink now.	Jichhax janiw umañ munkti.
That’s what it means.	Ukaw sañ muni.
That is not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he was the only one who saw her.	Ukampis jupa sapakiw jupar uñjäna.
So far that’s it.	Jichhakamax ukax ukhamawa.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
So he did just that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamwa luräna.
It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.
So we’re them.	Ukhamaw jiwasax jupanakar.
He’s a great guy.	Jupax jach’a jaqiwa.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw siskänti.
He felt the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
I never told him.	Janipuniw jupar siskti.
Or both .	Jan ukajj panpachaniw .
Make things better for yourself.	Juma pachpaw kuns sum lurañama.
I'm not a.	Nayax mä.
There’s nothing there.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkiti.
You’ve said it yourself many times.	Juma pachpaw walja kuti ukham sista.
That’s what he was doing.	Ukham luraskäna.
It’s a very nice guy.	Wali suma jaqiwa.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
He almost did it.	Jupajj niyaw ukham luräna.
He didn’t say why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa siskänti.
It feels a little better.	Mä juk’a suma jikxatasi.
And he .	Ukat jupax .
That’s not what I like.	Ukax janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
I don't want to see you.	Janiw nayajj jumar uñjañ munkti.
That doesn't work for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
I just don't like it.	Nayajj janiw ukajj gustkituti.
And again he refused.	Ukat wasitatwa jupajj jan munkänti.
It really felt that way.	Chiqpachansa ukhamwa amuyasïna.
He didn't mean it.	Jupajj janiw uk sañ munkänti.
I thought about how I felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta sasaw amuyayäta.
I feel that way now.	Jichhajj ukham jikjjatasta.
It doesn’t, of course.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
I just don’t know how.	Nayax janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I didn't do anything about it for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw uka toqet kuns lurkti.
I won't do it now.	Nayajj janiw jichhajj lurkäti.
I wonder what is going on.	Kunas pasaski sasaw jisktʼasta.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
You can do this on your own.	Ukajj juma pachpaw lurasma.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Still walking around, maybe.	Wali ch’amampiw sarnaqäna, inas.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
You have to make it a little easier.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’amampiw lurañama.
That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
No one knows exactly why.	Janiw khitis kunatsa uk sum yatkiti.
Or well, for that matter.	Jan ukax suma, uka tuqitxa.
I didn’t want to, ever again.	Janiw munkayätti, janipuniw mayampsa.
And it really works.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
That didn't mean anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
That means it will take time.	Ukajj tiempow munasini sañ muni.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
i don't know what to do.	nayax janiw yatkti.
So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
But I don't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañ munkti.
Nothing about that.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.

There was no one who was.	Janiw khitis khitis utjkänti.
I don't like it any more than you do.	Nayajj janiw jumat sipansa jukʼamp gustkituti.
Or why not.	Jan ukajj kunatsa jan ukhamäki.
I just don’t agree with that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitxa iyaw sañjamäkiti.
But it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukampis janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Janiw kunas pasaski uk yatkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
No one knows exactly how that will turn out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
I saw him once.	Mä kutiw jupar uñjta.
That’s what I don’t want.	Ukax nayax janiw munkti.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukanak lurañ munkti.

And it’s really worth it.	Ukat chiqpachansa wali askiwa.

Now you might have to do that.	Jichhajj inas ukham lurañajj wakischispa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.

That’s where I like it.	Ukanx nayatakix wali askiwa.

That’s what you need to do.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi.
There was nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkänti.
That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.

He said it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.
You do a good job.	Jumax mä suma irnaqäw lurasma.
He wasn't sure what he was saying.	Jupajj janiw kuntï siskäna uk sum yatkänti.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
That was the case.	Ukajj ukhamänwa.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.
And that’s exactly what he wanted.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax munäna.

But he never said anything about it.	Ukampis janipuniw uka toqet kuns siskänti.
I used to want to do it so soon.	Nayrajj ukham jankʼak lurañwa munta.
But there is nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But he’s a nice guy.	Ukampis jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
He’s not like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Some action is clearly needed.	Mä juk’a lurañax qhanaw wakisi.

In this case it is not.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.

That is never the case.	Ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
I'm not a.	Nayax mä.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
This was the first time he had done so.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw ukham luräna.

You’re right.	Jumax amuyta.
I don’t have anything to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti.

I didn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkti.
In one respect he was.	Mä tuqitxa jupax ukhamänwa.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
So what does that mean.	Ukhamajj ¿kunsa ukajj sañ muni.
I know that is him.	Ukajj jupaw uk yattwa.
He certainly knows this fact.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka cheq yati.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
There was nothing more to me.	Nayatakejj janiw kunas ukat sipan jukʼamp utjkänti.

Or it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
I don’t know what to do with you.	Nayax janiw kuns jumamp lurañ yatkti.

That’s what did it.	Ukaw uk luräna.

This is not what you want.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamäkiti.
That doesn't mean anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.

That’s actually, it is.	Ukax chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
He did that to me.	Jupajj nayaruw ukham luräna.

I say it all the time, all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukham sista, sapa kutiw.

It was exactly what he wanted.	Ukajj kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhamänwa.
He couldn’t stay still.	Jupax janiw wali qhiparañ puedkänti.
He said he didn’t.	Jupax janiw sasaw säna.

Now, or never.	Jichhax, jan ukax kunapachas.
But that first day doesn’t work.	Ukampis uka nayrïr urux janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.

I don't want to know any more.	Janiw jukʼamp yatiñ munkti.
Not everything is possible.	Janiw taqi kunas utjkaspati.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Here it is now.	Akax jichhax.
John felt the same way.	Juanajj ukhamarakiw amuyäna.
Maybe it’s worth it.	Inas ukax wakischispa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurkäti.
So you can't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
I don’t need this.	Nayax janiw akax wakiskiti.
I haven't seen him.	Nayajj janiw jupar uñjkti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He thought it was obvious.	Jupajj qhanaw sasaw amuyäna.
Both are still.	Panpachaniw wali.
This was obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Or, a little too much.	Jan ukax, mä juk’a sinti jach’a.

I actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurawayta.
You’re the one who thinks so.	Jumax ukham amuyta.
So he did just that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamwa luräna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It was really nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas ukhamäkänti.
But often this is not the case.	Ukampis walja kutiw jan ukhamäkiti.
You may need to do the same.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw inas wakischispa.

No one wants to talk to me.	Janiw khitis nayamp parlañ munkiti.
I can't believe it happened.	Ukajj pasäna uk janiw creykti.

That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t think so.	Janiw ukham amuyirïkti.

There wasn't much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
So there was no one.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
I’ve done it all.	Nayax taqpach lurawayta.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
He had no one to do anything with.	Jupajj janiw khitirus kuns lurañapatak utjkänti.
I just think so.	Nayax ukhamakiw amuyta.
I have never seen it better.	Janipuniw jukʼamp sum uñjkti.
He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He left with love.	Jupajj munasiñampiw sarjjäna.
I want to do something about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunsa lurañwa munta.
And you know, that’s what I like.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.

He wants to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañsa muni.

I’m not going to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
He was never like this before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.

He said to me again.	Jupajj wasitatwa nayarojj sitäna.

He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
There was no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkänti.
You really can’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
You can do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw lurasma.
You can do better!.	¡Jumajj jukʼamp sum lurasma!.
No one knew what to do.	Janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkänti.
So there is no need to do that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.

That’s what it felt like.	Ukaw ukham amuyasïna.
That’s even better.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa.
I never wanted anyone more.	Janipuniw khitirus jukʼamp munkayätti.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
No one wanted to do it.	Janiw khitis uk lurañ munkänti.
That doesn't appeal to me.	Ukajj janiw nayatak askïkiti.
I don't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
He doesn't know any better.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
He knew what had caused it.	Kunas ukham luratayna uk sum yatïna.
He never wanted that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk munkänti.
You can’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurañjamäkiti.
He said he didn't know how he got there.	Kunjamsa uka cheqar purini uk janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
I never did that.	Janipuniw uk lurkti.
He is just doing it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw luraski.
He was no different.	Jupajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
You where wrong.	Jumax kawkhans jan wali.
It all happened so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw pasäna.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayi.
Or where this is.	Jan ukax kawkhans akax utji.
I never said that.	Janipuniw uk siskti.
Something bigger than me.	Nayat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa kuna.
It happened so fast.	Ukham jankʼakiw pasäna.
He feels the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasi.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
So there is no time.	Ukhamajj janiw tiempojj utjkiti.
He was feeling sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I’ve definitely seen that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uk uñjta.
There was never any.	Janipuniw kunapachas utjkänti.
I don’t know where I’m doing it wrong.	Janiw kawkhansa jan walinak luraskta uk yatkti.
And this is good enough.	Ukat akax wali askiwa.
It doesn’t need to be.	Janiw ukax wakiskiti.
Also of course.	Ukhamaraki chiqpachansa.
You are a very nice person.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
He’s quick, he’s big.	Jupax jank’akiw, jach’a jaqiwa.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’d like to see some of it.	Nayax mä juk’a uñjañ munta.
But that is not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Somehow he did it.	Kunjamatsa jupax luratayna.
But he did it himself.	Ukampis jupaw uk luräna.
But there was nothing there.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
He never knew it.	Jupajj janipuniw yatkänti.
This is not available.	Akax janiw utjkiti.
I just don’t know how.	Nayax janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
I never liked him.	Janipuniw jupar gustkituti.

So nothing more needs to be done.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp lurañajj wakiskiti.
No, actually, not at all.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was nothing there.	Janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
This is a great guy.	Akax mä jach’a jaqiwa.

There is nothing to say.	Janiw kunas sañjamäkiti.
You are a very nice guy.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
This will happen too.	Akax ukhamarakiw pasani.
And it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukat janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
In this case it is not.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
No, it’s never been.	Janiwa, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
There was no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
You're the one who knows.	Jumax yatisktawa.
So far everything has been good.	Jichhakamax taqi kunas wali askiwa.

I’ve never seen them.	Janipuniw jupanakar uñjkti.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
The point was very clear.	Uka tuqitxa wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk wal munäna.
He refused to go there.	Jupajj uka cheqar sarañ janiw munkänti.
He’s very excited.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
And indeed it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
Something like that.	Mä kunas ukham.

That’s what he realized.	Ukaw amuyasïna.
It’s always there.	Ukax sapa kutiw utji.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
So that's why.	Ukhamajj ukatwa.
We don’t have that.	Jiwasax janiw ukham utjkiti.
There was no one about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit utjkänti.
But I don't think so.	Ukampis janiw nayajj ukham sañ munkiti.
That was the case for me.	Nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
There is no one.	Janiw khitis utjkiti.
He was well aware of this.	Jupajj uka toqet sumwa yatïna.
There was nothing for me.	Nayatakejj janiw kunas utjkänti.

I don’t know what to say to you.	Janiw kuns jumar sañ yatkti.
I don’t know how yet.	Kunjamsa uk janiw jichhakamax yatkti.
There, or there, or there.	Ukan, jan ukax ukan, jan ukax ukan.
He started talking to me.	Jupaw nayamp parltʼañ qalltäna.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
Now, this is something.	Jichhax, akax mä kunas ukhamawa.
Three times, actually.	Kimsa kuti, chiqpachansa.
I can’t agree with him on this.	Nayax janiw jupamp chika aka tuqitxa iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He said he wanted to talk about it.	Jupajj uka toqet parltʼañ munta sasaw säna.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp parlañ munkänti.
He has nothing to do with it.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
What you want but don’t want.	Kuntï munkta ukampis jan munkta uk.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
I didn't know what to do.	Nayajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
He wanted something from me.	Jupajj nayat kunsa munäna.
But there is no such thing.	Ukampis janiw ukham utjkiti.
And so far it has been.	Ukat jichhakamax ukhamawa.
he says, 'It's not.	sasaw saraki.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
That bought me some time.	Ukaw mä jukʼa tiempo alasïna.
No, it wasn't necessary.	Janiwa, janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
I'm not a.	Nayax mä.
No one else did that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
I think that’s obvious.	Nayax ukax qhanaw sasaw amuyta.
I think he knows that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uk yati.
I don’t think there is.	Nayax janiw utjkaspati sasin amuyta.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
You can do the same thing.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw lurasma.
But that doesn't mean anything will happen.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunas pasani sañ munkiti.
I can't believe it happened.	Ukajj pasäna uk janiw creykti.
That's what he's doing.	Ukajj jupajj luraski.
I thought it was a good year.	Nayax wali suma maraw sasaw amuyayäta.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
I am sad and worried.	Nayax llakitaw ukat llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I’m not going to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
I’m just doing it.	Nayax ukhamakiw luraskta.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
That doesn't work for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
Nothing is worth it.	Janiw kunas askïkiti.
He’s had a good year.	Jupax mä suma maraw jikxatasïna.
He did, but she didn't.	Jupajj uk luräna, ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
I don’t want to.	Nayax janiw munkti.
I have no idea how he knew.	Kunjamsa jupajj uk yatïna uk janiw amuykti.
I’ve done this a couple of times.	Mä pä kutiw ukham lurawayta.
This was the first time he had done so.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw ukham luräna.
I didn’t know anything yet.	Nayax janiw kunas jichhakamax yatkayätti.
I loved it so much.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw uñjta.

But there’s nothing there.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
I need to do this.	Nayax uk lurañaw wakisi.
It has nothing to do with me, one way or the other.	Janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti, mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqit.
I know you want to talk.	Nayax yattwa jumax parlañ munta.
He’s happy, she thought.	Jupax kusisitaw jikxatasi, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
There was no one.	Janiw khitis utjkänti.
He can do just that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw luraspa.
That’s what the guy did.	Ukhamaw uka waynax luräna.
And no, there’s nothing much you can do about it.	Ukat janiw, janiw kunas uka tuqit sinti lurañax utjkiti.
Now he didn't care.	Jichhajj janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
So there was nothing left.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
I really don’t think it matters.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukax wakiskiti sasaw amuyta.
I want to make this place.	Nayax aka chiqar lurañ munta.
No, of course, it is.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
Really.	Chiqpachansa.
And he means it.	Ukat jupax uk sañ muni.
I didn’t think so.	Janiw ukham amuyirïkti.
However, this is often impossible.	Ukampis ukham lurañajj walja kutiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
I’ve seen this many times.	Nayax walja kutiw uk uñjta.
I kind of like this one.	Nayax mä juk’a akax wali askiwa.
I never thought of it.	Janipuniw amuyirïkti.
I want to see you.	Nayax jumar uñjañ munta.
But today he moved quickly.	Ukampis jichhürojj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
He needed help.	Jupajj yanaptʼa munäna.
This is the case.	Akax ukhamawa.
I don’t want to do that.	Janiw nayax uk lurañ munkti.
But for me, I am still happy.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I saw it there.	Ukan uñjta.
So he did it.	Ukatwa jupajj uk luräna.
Nobody wants them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar munkiti.
And he said it wasn’t.	Ukat jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.
I’ve been doing this for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw uk lurawayta.
And that means one thing.	Ukat ukajj mä toqet sañ muni.
He just told me what you told him.	Jupajj kuntï jumajj jupar siskta uk jichhakiw sitäna.
But I know how I feel.	Ukampis kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sum yatta.
And how that happened.	Ukat kunjamsa ukajj pasäna.
He’s actually really nice.	Jupax chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
Something you can do alone.	Kunas juma sapakiw lurasma.
He doesn't know exactly.	Jupajj janiw sum yatkiti.
He seemed to be a nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

He was the first to leave.	Jupaw nayraqat sarjjäna.

He was really excited.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.

You are better than me.	Jumajj nayat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
But there is nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkiti.
I don't remember exactly what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw sum amtaskti.
That is what he wanted to do.	Ukaw jupajj lurañ munäna.
He said that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
I’ve done this before.	Nayax nayrax ukham lurawayta.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Inas mä juk’a, inas walja.
He wanted to talk a lot.	Jupajj wal parlañ munäna.

I want to see him again.	Nayax wasitat jupar uñjañ munta.
Good or bad.	Suma jan ukax jan wali.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I knew nothing about money.	Janiw qollqe toqet kuns yatkayätti.
But it is worth doing.	Ukampis uk lurañajj wali askiwa.
I don't know what it is.	Janiw kunas ukajj uk yatkti.
It’s a great guy.	Mä jach’a jaqiwa.
I didn’t have it.	Janiw nayajj utjkänti.

So I'm still very happy.	Ukhamajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I’ve seen him twice.	Nayax pä kutiw jupar uñjta.
He wants to go.	Jupax sarañ muni.
She immediately felt a little better.	Ukat jankʼakiw mä jukʼa sum jikjjatasïna.
He didn’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurkänti.
But that wasn’t really the case.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkänti.
I don’t like them.	Janiw jupanakar gustkituti.
Not so, he told himself.	Janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It was kind of like, you know.	Mä juk’a ukhamänwa, jumax yatisktawa.
He did what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna uk luräna.
He has always done so.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham lurawayi.
Now it's better.	Jichhax juk'amp askiwa.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj walpun munäna.
I mean a lot.	Nayax walpun sañ munta.
He wanted to know and he didn’t want to know.	Jupax yatiñ munäna ukat janiw yatiñ munkänti.
There’s nothing new there.	Ukanx janiw kunas machaq utjkiti.

All of these things need to be done.	Taqi ukanak lurañaw wakisi.
I want to see it somewhere.	Kawkhansa uk uñjañ munta.
He just knew that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw yatïna.
I don’t have anywhere else to go.	Janiw yaqha chiqar sarañax utjkituti.
So you have agreed.	Ukhamajj jumajj iyaw satawa.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.

Well, he thought.	Ukhamawa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
It happened many times.	Walja kutiw ukham pasäna.

It felt like a good idea.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyasïna.
It just happened to happen.	Ukajj ukhamakiw pasäna.
I never did, not really.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, janiw chiqpachansa.
And maybe again.	Ukat inas mayampsa.
I would have to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañaw wakisispa.
But really .	Ukampis chiqpachansa .
There’s never been anything quite like this.	Janipuniw kunas ukham taqpach utjkänti.
So what does it matter.	Ukhamajj kunas ukajj wakisispa.
But how do you do that?.	Ukampis ¿kunjamsa uk lurasma?.
No it’s not like that.	Janiwa janiw ukhamäkiti.
No one did anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkänti.
He didn't know any more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp yatkänti.

You need to do this job.	Jumax aka irnaqäw lurañaw wakisi.
And me, of course.	Ukat nayax, chiqpachansa.

He wants nothing to do with me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
No one knows at home.	Janiw khitis utan yatkiti.
I am really sorry about that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa llakistwa.
A rather large amount.	Mä juk’a jach’a qullqi.

He had done something wrong and he knew it.	Jupajj jan walinak luratayna ukat uk sum yatïna.
But it wasn’t necessary.	Ukampis janiw wakiskänti.
It happened again.	Ukajj wasitatwa pasäna.

He understood that.	Jupajj uk amuyäna.
I don’t know where to go.	Nayax janiw kawkirus sarañ yatkti.

He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw uk amuyaskänti.
There is nothing to do right now.	Jichhax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
And to me that means something.	Ukat nayatakix ukax mä kuns sañ muni.

You can do the same thing, you know.	Jumax ukhamarakiw lurasma, jumax yatisktawa.
That’s the way it is.	Ukhamaw uka tuqitxa.
He’s been there for a long time.	Jupax wali jaya pachaw ukan jikxatasïna.

This is something that needs to be done!.	¡Akax mä lurañaw wakisi!.
But he had never been able to do that before.	Ukampis janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurañ puedkänti.
Maybe you can do better.	Inas jumax jukʼamp sum lurasma.
You are a completely different person.	Jumax taqpach yaqha jaqiwa.

Of course you know that.	Chiqpachansa jumax uk yatisktawa.

He knew how to drink.	Jupax umañ yatïna.

It didn’t do very well.	Janiw sinti sum lurkänti.
And this is it!.	Ukat akax ukhamawa!.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

I had no idea what he was talking about.	Kuntï jupajj parlañ munkäna uk janiw yatkayätti.
He is a stupid guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqewa.

He took care of her.	Jupaw jupar uñjäna.

I always ask questions.	Nayax sapa kutiw jiskt’asta.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
But beyond that, it didn't feel like anything else.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw yaqha ukham amuyaskänti.

That means something more.	Ukajj jukʼamp kun sañ muni.

I didn't want that.	Nayajj janiw uk munkayätti.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukhamwa amuyäna.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.

Or he is doing something.	Jan ukajj kunsa luraski.
It was very obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
And he began to speak for himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw parlañ qalltäna.
He has to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurañapa.

And this is exactly what you want to avoid.	Ukat akax chiqpachapuniw kuntix jumax jan lurañ munkta ukax.

He’s totally amazing and wonderful.	Jupax taqpach muspharkañ ukat wali suma jaqiwa.

That’s the first thing he needs to do.	Ukaw nayrïr lurañapa.

There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.

He didn't want to go there.	Jupajj janiw uka cheqar sarañ munkänti.

But he loved it.	Ukampis jupajj walpun munäna.
It doesn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
It’s really like that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamawa.

One thing was very clear.	Mä tuqitxa wali qhanaw amuyasïna.

But it needs to be done.	Ukampis lurañaw wakisi.
This was not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
But he was the same.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
It really happened.	Chiqpachansa ukham pasäna.
That’s what you need.	Ukaw jumatakix wakisi.
About that, he says.	Uka tuqitxa, sasaw saraki.

So it just arrived.	Ukhamajj ukhamakiw purini.

I didn’t do anything.	Nayax janiw kuns lurkti.

For the first time, he thought so.	Nayrïr kutiw ukham amuyäna.

He just did it right away.	Jupax ukhamakiw luratayna.
I want to tell you what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiyañ munta.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukham sasaw amuyäna.
I don’t want to do anything about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munkti.
But that was something he took seriously.	Ukampis ukajj jupajj wali sumwa uñjäna.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañax utjkaspati.
You don’t have to do it again.	Janiw mayamp lurañax wakiskiti.
Everyone has them.	Taqinipuniw ukanak utji.
I didn’t see anything.	Janiw kuns uñjkti.
That’s saying something, of course.	Ukax mä kuns sañ muni, chiqpachansa.
But today, there is a constant.	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja, mä sapa kutiw utji.
That’s when it moves.	Ukax kunapachas sarnaqäna.

To be honest, he didn’t quite know.	Chiqpachansa, janiw sum yatkänti.

But I can’t believe I’m doing that.	Ukampis janiw uka lurañax iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
I don't care what you do.	Kuntï lurapkta ukajj janiw nayatak wakiskiti.

You know, he, but better.	Jumax yatisktawa, jupax, ukampis juk’amp askiwa.
You know what that is like.	Kunjamsa ukajj uk jumajj yatisktawa.
In this case it wasn’t.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn’t want to say anything.	Jupax janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
In fact, he did it.	Chiqpachansa, jupaw ukham luräna.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
That means a lot.	Ukajj walpun sañ muni.
Large and spacious.	Jach’a ukat jach’a.
He saw something.	Jupajj kunsa uñjäna.
And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
I know how that is.	Kunjamsa ukajj uk sum yatta.

I’m so sorry, but that’s what I need to do now.	Nayax wali llakistwa, ukampis ukax jichhax lurañaw wakisi.
Tomorrow is going to be a big day.	Qhipürux mä jach’a uruw utjani.
I never wanted anything more.	Janipuniw jukʼamp kuns munkti.
So that’s it for now.	Ukhamajj jichhajj ukhamawa.
He’s a human being now.	Jupax jichhax jaqiwa.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
What is the value of this?.	¿Kunas ukax utji?.
That wasn’t the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I want to talk about you.	Nayax jumat parlañ munta.
No one knew anything.	Janiw khitis kuns yatkänti.
And he realized what it was.	Ukat kunas uk amuyasïna.
I really need some help.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa yanaptʼa munta.
But I never believed him.	Ukampis janipuniw jupar creykti.
But there was never anything there.	Ukampis janipuniw kunas ukan utjkänti.
And you know that.	Ukat jumax uk yatisktawa.
He didn't say anything.	Janiw kunas siskänti.
He never really did.	Janipuniw chiqpachansa ukham lurkänti.
He had always done that.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham luräna.
It’s time we did that.	Jiwasax ukham lurañ pachaw purini.
None of that, really.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
He was doing well himself.	Jupa pachpaw wali sum luraskäna.
He had nothing to do.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
Three and three.	Kimsa ukat kimsa.
But he is like that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamawa.
I have nothing to do with it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit kuns lurkti.
Do this every time of the day.	Uka urux sapa kutiw ukham lurañama.

He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He had done something wrong .	Jupajj jan walinak luratayna .

It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
Beautiful and amazing.	Suma ukat muspharkañ.

This is just that.	Akax ukhamakiw.

I’m a little worried about it.	Nayax mä juk’a llakistwa uka tuqitxa.

He knew how to handle it.	Jupajj kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ yatïna.
That’s not what it’s about right now.	Ukax janiw jichhax uka tuqitxa.
She went home with him.	Jupampiw utar sarjjäna.

Nobody likes him.	Janiw khitis jupar gustkiti.
And there really is nothing to do.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But that’s not really the case.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkiti.
So I'm still very happy.	Ukhamajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I don’t think there’s anything you can do.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.
No, it doesn't exist.	Janiwa, janiw ukajj utjkiti.

I don’t remember much.	Janiw sinti amtaskti.
I understand that.	Nayax uk amuyta.
I didn’t understand it.	Janiw uk amuykayätti.
I am really sorry about that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa llakistwa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He doesn’t know about it.	Janiw uka tuqit yatkiti.
Or so I thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyayäta.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
He really, really was.	Jupax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
This is a character.	Akax mä jaqiwa.

That’s why it’s there.	Ukatwa ukan utji.
That's tomorrow though.	Ukax qharüruw ukampis.

He didn't do that to me.	Jupajj janiw nayarojj ukham lurkänti.

You know, it’s always going to be there.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukax sapa kutiw utjani.
But now there was nothing.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
I always have this.	Nayax sapa kutiw akax utjitu.
I saw glimpses of what he could do.	Kuntï jupajj luraspa uk mä qhawqha uñjta.
I didn’t see him.	Janiw jupar uñjkti.
He wanted to go.	Jupaw sarañ munäna.
I don’t see that.	Janiw uk uñjkti.
Or at least it was.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa tiempojj ukhamänwa.
Which, it turns out, makes sense.	Ukax, ukhamaw jikxatasi, ukax wali askiwa.
He walked quickly.	Jupax jank’akiw sarnaqäna.
I love these things.	Ukanak walpun munta.
I said of course.	Nayax chiqpachansa sasaw sista.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Now he’s one, somehow.	Jichhax jupax mä, kunjamatsa.
He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
I want to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ munta.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Nobody wanted them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar munkänti.
I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw lurawayta.
I'm not the one.	Nayajj jan ukajj naya.
I’m asking why.	Nayax kunatsa uk jiskt’asta.
He knows this very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sum yati.
I’m feeling pretty good.	Nayax wali sum jikxatastxa.
I think that’s it.	Nayax ukax ukhamawa sasaw amuyta.
You're the one who knows.	Jumax yatisktawa.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	Ukat janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañjamäkiti.
I did it, just recently.	Nayax uk lurawayta, jichhakiw ukham lurawayta.
There is no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
I don’t want to know.	Janiw yatiñ munkti.
He needed help.	Jupajj yanaptʼa munäna.
He tried to do it again.	Jupajj wasitat lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.
He did this for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukham luräna.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa lurañjamäkiti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I think so too.	Nayax ukhamarakiw amuyta.
I don’t know what to do.	Nayax janiw yatkti.
Which, of course, he is.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamawa.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.

I want to drink too much.	Nayax sinti umañ munta.
He almost refused.	Jupajj niyaw jan munkänti.
We are not the same.	Jiwasajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I really want to talk to you.	Chiqpachansa jumamp parltʼañ munta.
You really can’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
It can’t be done that way.	Janiw ukham lurañax utjkaspati.
I feel that this is true.	Ukajj cheqapuniw sasaw amuyasta.
He was very happy now.	Jupajj jichhajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I think it’s both.	Nayax panpachaniw sasaw amuyta.
It doesn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
Everything is anything.	Taqi kunas kunas.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
Clearly he didn’t know the first thing about it.	Qhanaw jupax janiw uka tuqit nayrïr kun yatkänti.
He did that for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow ukham luräna.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
You can’t do that.	Janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
And he did it again.	Ukat wasitatwa uk luräna.
That's what he thought.	Ukaw jupajj amuyäna.
I don’t mean you, of course.	Janiw nayax jumat sañ munkti, chiqpachansa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
But no one really knows for sure.	Ukampis janiw khitis chiqpachapuni sum yatkiti.

He’s not good enough for you.	Jupax janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
He knew it well enough.	Jupajj sum yatïna.
He never wanted that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk munkänti.
He’s just like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw.
It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
But it’s just that for now.	Ukampis jichhax ukhamakiw.
There is no way to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax utjkiti.
That’s how it’s arrived.	Ukhamaw purini.
He says he doesn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw saraki.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
You can’t say no.	Janiw janiw sañjamäkiti.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.
That’s what this is all about.	Ukaw akax utji.
He was never like that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
But he didn't understand.	Ukampis janiw amuykänti.
I want everything.	Nayax taqi kuns munta.
Or it doesn't.	Jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have always been very aware of this.	Uka tuqitxa nayratpachaw wal amuyasta.
But he couldn't do it.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañ puedkänti.
And today it was.	Ukat jichhürunakanxa ukhamänwa.
Nobody likes him.	Janiw khitis jupar gustkiti.
And he was like that.	Ukat jupax ukhamänwa.
No one wanted to talk about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
But at least it is.	Ukampis mä jukʼa tiempojj ukhamawa.

It was something we never did at all.	Ukajj kuntï janipuniw kuns lurapkta ukhamänwa.

So far there is nothing for you.	Jichhakamax janiw kunas jumatakix utjkiti.

Not the other way around.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.

I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do.	Nayax llakistwa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He said he wanted to drive.	Ukat auto apnaqañ munta sasaw säna.
And then he started telling me why.	Ukat ukat kunatsa uk yatiyañ qalltäna.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.

So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
But that is not the case today.	Ukampis jichhürunakan janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.

It’s impossible to say.	Janiw sañjamäkiti.
Maybe a lot, maybe a little.	Inas walja, inas mä juk’a.

He gave it to her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar churäna.

And this is very much though.	Ukat akax wali jach’a ukampis.

Today, he was not available.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw jupajj utjkänti.

I can’t do any more.	Nayax janiw juk’amp lurañjamäkiti.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He knew exactly what to do, how much to do.	Jupax kuns lurañapa, qawqha lurañas uk sum yatïna.
That's what he said.	Ukham sasaw säna.
But he could not speak.	Ukampis jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
I understand that’s it.	Nayax amuyasta ukax.
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Jupaw nayamp parltʼañ munta sasaw sitäna.
He said he had no intention of doing so.	Janiw ukham lurañ amtkti sasaw säna.
He refused both.	Jupajj panpachaniw jan munkänti.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
Serious work is required.	Sinti lurañaw wakisi.
But, however.	Ukampis, ukampis.
Everything will be there.	Taqi kunas utjani.
He was very affectionate.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw uñjäna.
It felt very good.	Ukajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m thinking about it.	Nayax amuyta.
They are the.	Jupanakax uka...
There is nothing else !.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti !.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
The book of the day.	Uka uru libro.
He knew what he was doing to me.	Jupajj kuntï nayar lurkäna uk sum yatïna.
But he didn't want that now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj uk munkänti.
That is what he decided to do.	Ukaw jupajj amtäna.
But he isn't like that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And this one.	Ukat akax.
I don't know how to do it.	Janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkti.
I don't know exactly.	Janiw nayajj sum yatkti.
He understood better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa amuyäna.
There is no way to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj utjkaspati.
He didn't know how he knew.	Kunjamsa uk yatïna uk janiw yatkänti.
I see them every day.	Nayax sapa uruw jupanakar uñjta.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
You don’t need the money.	Janiw qullqix wakiskiti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
You don’t have to drive.	Janiw autot sarañax wakiskiti.
He knows how you feel.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sum yati.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
This happened many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasäna.
He didn't need to.	Jupajj janiw wakiskänti.
Good kind of thing.	Suma kasta.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyäna.
But no one did it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
He’s doing really well.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw sum luraski.
And he knew it well.	Ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
But now it is clear to me.	Ukampis jichhajj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasi.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He is doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraski.
That’s good, he thought.	Ukax wali askiwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
And another thing.	Ukat yaqha tuqitxa.
He said no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp siskänti.
Also, he’s two people.	Ukhamaraki, jupax pä jaqiwa.
And that's a good thing.	Ukat ukajj wali askiwa.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
So I haven’t seen it.	Ukhamajj janiw uñjkti.
And there’s money to be made.	Ukat qullqix lurañatakiw utji.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He was a little .	Jupajj mä jukʼa .
How long will it last? 	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukajj utjani?
But you know, he’s a good guy.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa, jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
You don’t have to do that yet.	Janiw jichhakamax ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Maybe that’s the point.	Inas ukax uka tuqitxa.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
I see it so well.	Ukham sum uñjta.
I like everything about it.	Nayatakix taqi kunas uka tuqitx wali askiwa.
But he didn't know exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum yatkänti.
Maybe I think it is.	Inas nayax amuyta.
He wants something more.	Jupajj jukʼamp kunsa muni.
I don’t know.	Janiw yatkiti.
I’ve done this a few times.	Mä qawqha kutiw ukham lurawayta.
He told me that he was.	Jupajj sasaw sitäna.
No one really knows.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatkiti.
Nobody wanted them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar munkänti.
It is obvious however.	Ukajj qhanaw ukampis.
I don’t really know how to do it.	Nayax janiw chiqpachans kunjams lurañ yatkti.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj wal munäna.
That never happened to me.	Ukajj janipuniw nayatakejj utjkänti.
Perhaps the	Inas uka .
They are not like that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
About me, it’s.	Naya tuqitxa.
Perhaps you feel that way.	Inas jumajj ukham amuyasta.
That’s how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupax jikxatasïna.
Who he is uk.	Khitis jupax uk.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He was practically helpless.	Jupajj niyaw jan kuns lurañ puedkänti.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
They like it a lot, you don't.	Jupanakajj wal gusti, janiw jumajj gustkiti.
I want a car.	Nayax mä auto munta.
I’ve seen it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham uñjta.
That, he said.	Ukax, sasaw säna.
So he doesn't know what he wants.	Ukhamajj janiw kuntï munki uk yatkiti.
The same two.	Pachpa pä.
I thought it was something.	Kunas ukhamänwa sasaw amuyayäta.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurañ puedkänti.
There was no one to do it.	Janiw khitis uk lurañapatak utjkänti.
But obviously not.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
But he couldn't do it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw puedkänti.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sumwa yatïna.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He knew he would.	Jupajj ukham lurani uk sum yatïna.
I don't understand what he was saying.	Kuntï jupajj siskäna uk janiw amuykti.
The first day went really well.	Nayrïr urux chiqpachapuniw wali sum saräna.
It was really obvious.	Chiqpachansa qhanaw amuyasïna.
No one knew the language.	Janiw khitis uka aru yatkänti.
He wanted to go home.	Jupajj utar sarañ munäna.
And that’s what’s happening.	Ukat ukax kunas pasaski.
But it was a long time.	Ukampis wali jaya tiempow pasäna.
I wasn't sure what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
I’m going to ride this.	Nayax aka munta.
That's what he did.	Ukajj jupaw luräna.
I don’t know where it will lead.	Janiw kawkirus purini uk yatkti.
I didn't know anything about it.	Janiw uka toqet kuns yatkayätti.
I don’t know who likes me.	Janiw khitis nayar gustkituti uk yatkti.
But you know that .	Ukampis jumax uk yatisktawa .
I never said never.	Janipuniw janipuniw siskti.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
The point is obvious.	Uka tuqitxa qhanaw amuyasi.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
For one thing, it’s long.	Mä tuqitxa, jaya pachaw utji.
That, in my opinion, is better.	Ukax, nayatakix, juk’amp askiwa.
I wonder why it exists.	Kunatsa ukham utji sasaw jisktʼasta.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
he thought to himself.	sasaw amuyäna.
You, you want to see everyone.	Jumax, jumax taqiniruw uñjañ munta.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
Well the money is worth it.	Suma qullqix wali askiwa.
Why.	Kunatsa.
Same language, of course.	Pachpa aru, chiqpachansa.
What's the.	Kunas uka.
He seems to be a different person.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I am not sure how or why.	Kunjamsa jan ukajj kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkti.
It was just as he said it would be.	Kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukhamänwa.
But that’s certainly not the case right now.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti.
This is the best thing I’ve ever done.	Akax nayatakix wali askiwa.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
Whatever the need.	Kunas wakisispa.
He didn't refuse to.	Jupajj janiw jan munkänti.
So he didn't say anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns siskänti.
But he didn't say anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns siskänti.
He knew better than that.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
He said he didn’t know.	Janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
I don’t say anything.	Janiw kuns siskti.
Every person is.	Sapa jaqiwa.
He went right to the point.	Jupajj cheqapuniw saräna.
You always do that.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham lurasma.
He never did that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
Therefore there are two things.	Ukatwa pä kunas utji.
I've done it.	Nayajj uk lurawayta.
I want to do that.	Nayax uk lurañ munta.
I would love to know.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw yatiñ munta.
I haven’t decided yet.	Nayax janiw jichhakamax amtkti.
I don't know what's going on with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas pasaski uk yatkti.
It wants to eat.	Ukax manq’añ muni.
I agree with you on this.	Nayax jumamp chikaw aka tuqitxa.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t know what the outcome will be.	Uka tuqitxa kunas utjani uk janiw yatkti.
No one knows better than you.	Janiw khitis jumat sipan jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Now I am doing it all on my own.	Jichhajj taqe ukanak sapakiw luraskta.
I want to buy that.	Nayax uka alañ munta.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
That's what he told me.	Ukhamaw jupajj sitäna.
I’m sure he can do well.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax wali sum luraspa.
He needs to act quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw kuns lurañapa.
I don't know exactly what happened to that.	Ukajj kunas pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
Really, really good.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurawayi.
You’re agreed.	Jumax iyaw satawa.
He’s just like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw.
But it wasn't, he wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I feel pretty good about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa jikxatastxa.
He’s a really nice guy.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw wali suma jaqiwa.
Or anyone else.	Jan ukax khitirus.
He always knows it.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk yati.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
This is the only one.	Akax mä sapakiw.
He refused to help with it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yanaptʼañ munkänti.
I asked again.	Nayax wasitat jiskt’asta.
I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurawayta.
I don’t know where it’s going.	Janiw kawkirus saraski uk yatkti.
He really knew how to do things.	Chiqpachansa, kunjamsa kunsa lurañ yatïna uk sum yatïna.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
You can pretty much do it all.	Jumax niyaw taqi ukanak lurasma.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
I didn't know what he was saying but it was obvious what he was saying.	Janiw kuntï siskäna uk yatkayätti ukampis kuntï siskäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
It really isn’t .	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti .
This was not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He means very well.	Jupax wali sum sañ muni.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
Something meant that.	Kunas ukham sañ munäna.
That’s still our biggest.	Ukax wali jiwasan jach’a.
No, that is not possible.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
I agree with him.	Nayajj jupamp iyaw sasaw ukham sista.
And that’s not the best thing to do.	Ukat janiw ukax wali askïkiti.
It’s also pretty great.	Ukhamaraki wali jach’a.
There's a.	Ukax mä.
I want to go alone.	Nayax sapakiw sarañ munta.
But for a long time no one knew.	Ukampis walja tiempojj janiw khitis uk yatkänti.
You can definitely do it.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw uk lurasma.
I don’t know that.	Janiw uk yatkti.
It will last longer.	Ukax juk’amp jaya pachaw utjani.
I'm very happy with one.	Nayax wali kusisitaw mä.
I think he is.	Nayax jupax ukham amuyta.
But I’m still worried.	Ukampis nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
So I feel that very well.	Ukhamajj uk wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And really, he didn't want one.	Ukat chiqpachansa, janiw mä jukʼa munkänti.
Which, of course, he was.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamänwa.
I disagree with that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet iyaw siskti.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
He said he didn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham gustkituti sasaw säna.
I realize that is happening to me.	Nayarojj ukham pasaski uk amuyasta.
He wanted something.	Jupajj kunsa munäna.
This is the case.	Aka kasta.
I know it's pretty good.	Nayax wali sum yatta.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Ukampis, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He now knew why.	Kunatsa uk jichhajj sum yatïna.
And that day.	Ukat uka uru.
It wasn’t.	Ukhamänwa.
He is a truly remarkable man.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.
I really want the job.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uka irnaqäw munta.
That’s what he realized.	Ukaw amuyasïna.
Or, it used to be.	Jan ukajj, nayrajj ukhamänwa.
You think so, but you don’t.	Jumax ukham amuyta, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He does not know why he feels that way.	Kunatsa ukham amuyi uk janiw yatkiti.
I know you know that.	Nayax yattwa jumax uk yatisktawa.
It’s going pretty well.	Ukax wali sum saraski.
But he didn't know that.	Ukampis janiw uk yatkänti.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
¿What's the matter? 	¿Kunas utji?
I don’t think it was.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw amuyta.
He never noticed.	Jupajj janipuniw amuyaskänti.
He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
He really didn’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkänti.
I know he does that.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luraski.
I want to see them.	Nayax jupanakar uñjañ munta.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
What do you think?.	¿Kunsa jumajj amuyta?.
And why.	Ukat kunatsa.
Where do you want to go first?.	¿Kawkirus nayraqat sarañ munta?.
It’s nice to do it there again.	Ukan wasitat lurañax wali askiwa.
a.	mä.
More needs to be done.	Jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
Somehow it felt the same way.	Kunjamatsa ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasïna.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m just waiting for it.	Nayax ukhamakiw suyt’askta.
And very, very quickly.	Ukat wali, wali jank’akiw.
They don’t have the money.	Jupanakax janiw qullqix utjkiti.
Couldn't agree more.	Janiw jukʼamp iyaw sañjamäkiti.
It was, but it didn't.	Ukajj ukhamänwa, ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
In a way he loves it.	Mä kasta tuqitxa jupax walpun munasi.
That’s what happened that night.	Ukhamaw uka arumax pasäna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
A little too much.	Mä juk’a sinti jach’a.
And he didn’t want anything else.	Ukat janiw yaqha munkänti.
Another thing I like.	Yaqha tuqitxa nayatakix wali askiwa.
I am not sure about that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
I understood it perfectly.	Nayajj sumwa amuyayäta.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Financially worth it.	Qullqi tuqitxa wali askiwa.
But I don't know exactly where he is now.	Ukampis jichhajj kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk janiw sum yatkti.
I’m just like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw.
What do you think will happen?.	¿Kunas pasani sasin amuyta?.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
It was obvious to me that he did not.	Janiw ukham lurkänti, ukajj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I didn’t really know that.	Janiw cheqpachapun uk yatkayätti.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
What’s going to happen?.	¿Kunas pasani?.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
So we have to .	Ukhamajj jiwasajj .
He did that today.	Jichhüruw ukham luräna.
I am not sure at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa sum yatkti.
I can’t believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He’s available immediately.	Jupax jank’akiw utji.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing.	Jupax janiw kuns luraski uk yatkiti.
He didn't tell anyone he was waiting.	Janiw khitirus suytʼaskta siskänti.
I want to see what happens.	Kunas pasani uk uñjañ wal munta.
I don’t know why.	Nayax janiw kunatsa.
He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
I haven't seen that.	Nayajj janiw uk uñjkti.
I know what it is.	Nayax yattwa kunas uk.
I’m hoping for that.	Nayax ukham suyt’askta.
I think it’s him.	Nayax jupaw sasaw amuyta.
But that’s how it started.	Ukampis ukhamwa qalltäna.
They certainly were.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
You might do worse.	Inas jukʼamp jan walinak lurasma.
He knows when it is necessary.	Kunapachas wakisispa uk jupaw sum yati.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He wanted to talk to her.	Jupampiw parltʼañ munäna.
No, there really wasn’t.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa janiw utjkänti.
That’s even better.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa.
It’s a great day.	Mä jach’a uru.
I’m doing pretty good.	Nayax wali sum luraskta.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He could not go now.	Jichhajj janiw sarañ puedkänti.
I’m going to agree.	Nayax iyaw sañ munta.
But he seemed to be a nice guy.	Ukampis jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He did much better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna.
They need to do that.	Jupanakax ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He gladly agreed.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw iyaw säna.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
He did it again, and.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk luräna, ukat.
It's not necessary.	Janiwa wakiskiti.
And so it goes.	Ukat ukhamaw saraski.
You are a very nice person.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
But that happened a long time ago.	Ukampis ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyasïna.
It was something he had done before.	Ukajj nayrajj lurkäna ukhamänwa.
He doesn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkiti.
But he didn't realize it.	Ukampis janiw uk amuyaskänti.
But there is too much time.	Ukampis sinti tiempow utji.
I’m a little disappointed.	Nayax mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatastxa.
That's what he said.	Ukhamaw jupajj säna.
He started talking to himself.	Jupa pachpaw parlañ qalltäna.
No, there is nothing to do.	Janiwa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
It’s really not like that why.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti kunatsa.
He knew exactly what he was going to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurani uk sum yatïna.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
They have a .	Jupanakax mä .
Everything is good for me.	Taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa.
He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
And he knew it.	Ukat jupax uk yatïna.
He doesn’t understand what he’s saying.	Jupax janiw kuntï siskäna uk amuykiti.
That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
Whatever is happening.	Kunas kunas pasaski.
I didn't know what to do there.	Ukan kun lurañsa janiw yatkayätti.
That’s really good.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
Or so it was.	Jan ukajj ukhamänwa.
Now it was like that.	Jichhajj ukhamänwa.
It feels pretty obvious to me.	Nayatakix wali qhanaw jikxatasi.
He went somewhere else.	Jupajj yaqha cheqar saräna.
I have my own.	Nayajj naya pachpaw utjitu.
There isn’t one thing.	Janiw mä kunas utjkiti.
So it never happens.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
That’s good of course.	Ukax wali askiwa chiqpachansa.
The three of them.	Uka kimsa.
Hope to see you soon.	Jumanakar jankʼak uñjañ suytʼaskta.
I’ve seen a little bit of it.	Nayax mä juk’a uñjta.
But it happened faster.	Ukampis jukʼamp jankʼakiw pasäna.
But you know, it’s never enough.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa, janipuniw ukax wakiskiti.
I knew he would.	Ukham lurani uk sum yatiyäta.
But you can still do it.	Ukampis jumajj wali sumwa lurasma.
I’ve done it.	Nayax uk lurawayta.
He had just realized something.	Jupajj jichhakiw kuns amuyäna.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he wasn't about to say that.	Ukampis janiw niyaw ukham sañ munkänti.
That’s a little bit.	Ukax mä juk’a.
He didn't quite understand what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk janiw sum amuykänti.
Three three.	Kimsa kimsa.
I can't say exactly when.	Kunapachas uk janiw sum siskti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I feel the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta.

I have done this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham lurawayta.

So it was a very long time.	Ukhamajj wali jaya tiempow ukajj pasäna.
But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
This was obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

Or every three.	Jan ukax sapa kimsa.

So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He told them so.	Jupaw jupanakar ukham säna.
But he was very reluctant.	Ukampis jupajj walpun jan munkänti.
But somehow, it doesn’t.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, janiw ukhamäkiti.

I didn't know exactly.	Nayajj janiw sum yatkayätti.
No, he didn’t do that.	Janiwa, janiw uk lurkänti.

That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

To do this, you really need to do two things.	Uk lurañatakix chiqpachapuniw pä lurañax wakisi.

That's what he told me.	Ukham sasaw sitäna.

He didn't do it right.	Jupajj janiw sum lurkänti.

He never wanted her.	Jupajj janipuniw jupar munkänti.

There is no need to rush it.	Janiw jankʼak lurañajj wakiskiti.

I didn’t see anyone.	Janiw khitirus uñjkti.
He wasn’t like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s what it takes.	Ukaw wakisispa.
But this is actually interesting.	Ukampis chiqpachansa akax wali askiwa.
He didn't want to tell me.	Jupajj janiw nayat yatiyañ munkänti.
I thought that was the case.	Ukham sasaw amuyayäta.
And with him.	Ukat jupamp chika.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he said nothing more.	Ukat janiw jukʼamp kuns siskänti.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayi.
He didn't do these things.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurkänti.
Or as it were.	Jan ukajj kunjamtï.
I am not sure about that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
Nothing, maybe.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, inas.
I want him to be there.	Nayajj jupar munta.
But it cannot be done immediately.	Ukampis janiw jankʼak lurañjamäkiti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I haven’t really seen it.	Janiw chiqpachapuni uñjkti.
I really didn’t know anything else.	Chiqpachansa janiw yaqha tuqit yatkayätti.
I have nothing to do with it.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti.
I’ve already done that.	Nayax niyaw ukham lurawayta.

That’s not what it’s about right now.	Ukax janiw jichhax uka tuqitxa.

No, he didn't want to.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw munkänti.
But it wasn’t, of course.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, chiqpachansa.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
He’s very excited.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.

It doesn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkiti.

He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
But now the day has come.	Ukampis jichhajj uruw purini.

So you're the one.	Ukhamajj jumajj.

Almost every day.	Niya sapa uru.
Also, the character.	Ukhamaraki.
He knows better than he does.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum yati.
Nothing like doing what you want.	Janiw kunas jumax kuntï munkta uk lurañjamäkiti.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
And he doesn’t want anything.	Ukat jupax janiw kuns munkiti.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
How did you feel about it.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna.
There was no one there.	Janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
Is this something that needs to be done.	¿Akax kuna lurañas wakisispati.
I don’t want to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
Or whatever.	Jan ukax kuna.

He went quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw saräna.
It’s never been that way.	Janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
I know he did that.	Ukham luratapat yattwa.
He’s just like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Who is better than me.	Khitis nayat sipansa.
I just think so.	Nayax ukhamakiw amuyta.
It means nothing to me.	Nayatakejj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
Maybe I’ll do one someday.	Inas mä urux mä lurañax wakischispa.
He improved but not all.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna ukampis janiw taqe kuns lurkänti.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

He’s the one who knows me.	Jupaw nayat yati.

¡No one wants that!.	¡Janiw khitis uk munkiti!.
I understand what he is going through.	Kuntï jupajj pasaski uk sum amuyasta.

Something needs to be done.	Kunas lurañaw wakisi.

Great, he said.	Jach’a, sasaw säna.
But no one knew much.	Ukampis janiw khitis wal yatkänti.
There is only one.	Mä sapakiw utji.
That wasn't what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw munkänti.
But he loves her very much.	Ukampis jupar wal munasi.
Here, there is none of that.	Akax, janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.

I’ve said this many times.	Nayax walja kutiw uk sañ munta.

Nothing really needs to be that big of a deal.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas ukham jachʼa lurañax wakiskiti.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
He felt the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasïna.
That was the case in the past.	Ukhamaw nayrajj pasäna.
He didn't understand that.	Jupajj janiw uk amuykänti.
That’s almost three.	Ukax niyaw kimsa.
It takes a lot of time.	Ukajj walja tiempow wakisi.
He certainly did.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukham luräna.

I think it will be faster.	Nayax amuyta ukax juk’amp jank’akiw utjani.

And a good one.	Ukat mä suma.
But he wanted to do more.	Ukampis jukʼamp lurañwa munäna.
No one else did it.	Janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
But right now, there’s nothing there.	Ukampis jichhax, janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
He didn't know where else to go.	Jupajj janiw yaqha cheqar sarañ yatkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don't know what happened before.	Janiw nayrajj kunas paskäna uk yatkti.
But here's the thing.	Ukampis aka.
I wish he wouldn’t do that.	Nayax jan ukham lurañap munta.
He wants something.	Jupajj kunsa muni.

But he didn't know that.	Ukampis janiw uk yatkänti.
That was the case now.	Ukajj jichhajj ukhamänwa.
It doesn’t matter to me one way or the other.	Nayatakix janiw kunas mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqitxa.
He has asked you many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jumar mayïna.
He didn't want to go any farther.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp jaya sarañ munkänti.
Or lives here.	Jan ukax akan jakasi.
Too many, in fact.	Sinti walja, chiqpachansa.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
I don’t know anything about you.	Janiw jumat kuns yatkti.

He was more comfortable here with her.	Jupax akan jupamp chikaw juk’amp sum jikxatasïna.

I’ve never seen him so happy.	Janipuniw jupar ukham kusisit uñjkti.
I don’t know anywhere.	Nayax janiw kawkhans yatkti.
It just happened to happen.	Ukajj ukhamakiw pasäna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s exactly what it is.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa.
I know about it now.	Jichhajj uka toqet sum yatta.
But he meant it.	Ukampis jupajj uk sañ munäna.
I want a driver’s license.	Nayax auto apnaqañ permiso munta.
And I don’t mean ‘we’.	Ukat janiw ‘jiwasax’ sañ munkti.
How long it took him, he didn't know.	Qhawqha tiempos jupar pasäna, uk janiw yatkänti.

But I really have no idea how to do that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kunjamsa ukham lurañax uk amuykti.
I thought they were interesting.	Nayax jupanakax wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
He didn't tell anyone.	Janiw khitirus siskänti.
But the young man would not say no.	Ukampis uka waynax janiw “janiw” sañ munkänti.

He was walking around a lot.	Jupajj wal sarnaqäna.
Something he saw.	Kunas jupax uñjäna.
So you can't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
I don’t want to do this.	Nayax janiw aka tuqit lurañ munkti.

No one quite understands this.	Janiw khitis ukanak sum amuykiti.

There is nothing more to do.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkiti.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
He saw her for a moment.	Mä jukʼa jupar uñjäna.
Hence, the coffee.	Ukatwa, uka café.
He never knew that.	Janiw kunapachas uk yatkänti.
Or nothing much at all.	Jan ukajj janiw kunas sinti utjkiti.
But it can't be as you say.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumajj siskta ukham utjkaspati.

That’s exactly what it is.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa.

And nobody wants that.	Ukat janiw khitis uk munkiti.

Or, he didn't want to do that.	Jan ukajj, janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
He said he wanted to talk.	Parlañ munta sasaw säna.

But that wasn’t the case that day.	Ukampis janiw uka urux ukhamäkänti.
He’s not good enough for you.	Jupax janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
He wanted to go with her, of course.	Jupampiw sarañ munäna, chiqpachansa.

So he didn't want to talk.	Ukhamajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he loved it.	Ukat jupajj walpun munäna.

And he did it for a very long time.	Ukat wali jaya tiempow ukham luräna.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
That is not the case now.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that doesn't make it any better.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jukʼamp askïkiti.
Now he realized that was not the case.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
I'm going to love it.	Nayajj walpun munta.
It’s not what you think it is.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.

So he went there.	Ukatwa jupajj ukar saräna.

There’s nothing there for you.	Ukanx janiw kunas jumatakix utjkiti.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.

He decided not to.	Jupajj janiw sasaw amtäna.

And he didn't for a while.	Ukat mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw ukham lurkänti.
He is happy about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
But that is not possible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
It does what you want.	Ukaw kuntï munkta uk luraski.

And, not everything is true.	Ukat, janiw taqi kunas chiqpachapuni sañ munkiti.
But he didn't mean that.	Ukampis janiw uk sañ munkänti.
So it happened to me once or twice.	Ukhamajj mä kuti jan ukajj pä kutiw nayar pasäna.
I don't know how anyone knew.	Kunjamsa khitis uk yatïna uk janiw yatkti.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.

I think he was happy.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
But that didn't last long.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jaya tiempojj utjkänti.
He did the same thing.	Jupajj ukham luräna.
I'm not sure why he did that.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkti.
You can do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw ukham lurasma.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham luratayna.
He didn't know what to say to anyone.	Kuntï khitirus sañ munkäna uk janiw yatkänti.
He understood immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw amuyasïna.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
It happened all the time.	Ukajj sapa kutiw pasäna.
Something just happened.	Kunas jichhakiw pasäna.

To be honest, there was nothing.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunas utjkänti.

Everything is still human.	Taqi kunas wali jaqiwa.

And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupax lurawayi.
Or, not really.	Jan ukax, janiw chiqpachansa.

This is unusual for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
I’m doing something on my own.	Naya pachpaw kuns luraskta.
But that meant everything to me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj taqe kun sañ munäna.

It’s really not good, he thought.	Chiqpachansa janiw askïkiti, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Really.	Chiqpachansa.
I will never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkäti.
And that doesn't make it any better.	Ukat ukajj janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.

I want to make it better somehow.	Nayax kunjamatsa juk’amp suma lurañ munta.

He couldn't talk to her.	Jupajj janiw jupamp parlañ puedkänti.

Or whether you want it or not.	Jan ukajj munasmati janicha.
That’s more or less the case now, of course.	Ukax jichhax juk’amp jan ukax juk’amp ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
He thought it was never necessary.	Janipuniw wakiskiti sasaw amuyäna.
No one had ever done anything like this before.	Janiw khitis nayrajj ukham kuns lurkänti.

He did as he did.	Jupajj kunjamtï jupajj lurkäna ukhamwa luräna.
He watched her every moment.	Jupajj sapa kutiw kunjamsa sarnaqäna uk uñjäna.

He thoroughly enjoyed his time with me.	Jupajj nayamp chika tiempojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

And he always told me something else.	Ukat sapa kutiw yaqha tuqit sitäna.
But he did no more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurkänti.
So today, he's what's going on.	Ukhamajj jichhürunakanjja, jupajj kunas pasaski.
That’s good enough for now.	Ukax jichhax wali askiwa.
It felt like a long time, actually.	Walja tiempos ukhamwa amuyasïna, chiqpachansa.

I’ve always wanted to see it but never did.	Nayax nayratpachaw uñjañ munta ukampis janipuniw uñjkti.

That’s good, of course.	Ukax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
He did it for me.	Jupaw nayatak uk luräna.

Another way, too.	Yaqha tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.

I have no idea what happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna uk janiw amuykti.

He couldn't do anything about it now.	Jichhajj janiw uka toqet kuns lurañ puedkänti.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.
He never did that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.

This was not what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
I’m doing better now, actually.	Jichhax juk’amp sum luraskta, chiqpachansa.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I want to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurañ munta.
I take care of everything and everyone in terms of food.	Nayax taqi kuns uñjta ukat taqiniruw manq’añ tuqitx uñjta.

Not this is the case.	Janiw akax ukhamäkiti.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
She told him she was happy.	Jupajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta sasaw jupar säna.
He has nothing to do with it.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
There is a lot of interest in this.	Uka tuqitxa wali askiwa.
He had just left.	Jupajj jichhakiw sarjjäna.

So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
What are you waiting for?.	¿Kunsa jumajj suytʼaskta?.

He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
All well and good.	Taqi kunas wali suma ukat suma.

I don’t want to go alone.	Nayax janiw sapak sarañ munkti.

But I don't know exactly where he is now .	Ukampis jichhajj kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk janiw sum yatkti .
He’s like that for me.	Jupax nayatakix ukhamawa.
It is a great pleasure for me to do so.	Ukham lurasajj nayatakejj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He didn't know what he was saying.	Jupajj janiw kuntï siskäna uk yatkänti.

He decided it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk amtäna.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
And another word.	Ukat yaqha aru.
Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
It’s going to get to everyone.	Ukax taqiniruw purini.
I'm not the one who's.	Janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.

That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.

But it never happened.	Ukampis janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
That happened a long time ago.	Ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
I’d rather have that.	Nayax ukax juk’amp askiwa.
This was not the way it was supposed to work.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï lurañapäkäna ukhamäkänti.
He was getting more and more depressed.	Jupajj jukʼamp llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
And there isn't much time left.	Ukat janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
I don’t see it that way.	Nayax janiw ukham uñjkti.
No one wanted to do anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurañ munkänti.

You don’t have to do it again.	Janiw mayamp lurañax wakiskiti.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.	Mä juk’a aka, mä juk’a uka.
Or at least it's worth it.	Jan ukajj wali askiwa.
But it’s actually worth it.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
I want to go again.	Nayax wasitat sarañ munta.
He is a very happy person.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
I don’t want that.	Nayax janiw uk munkti.
He was doing it alone.	Jupajj sapakiw uk luraskäna.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
But today there was none.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw kunas utjkänti.
Something’s pretty great.	Kunas wali jach’a.

He meant to her.	Jupajj jupar sañ munäna.
That’s the way it is.	Ukhamaw uka tuqitxa.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
This is exactly what it means to me.	Akax chiqpachapuniw nayatakix sañ muni.
But he didn’t want to do it, of course.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
He has always been like that.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham sarnaqäna.

He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
You know what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk jumajj yatisktawa.
And it doesn’t have to be that way.	Ukat janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.

He was doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraskäna.
He loves you so much.	Jupajj jumar wal munasi.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Jupajj janiw kuntï luraskäna uk yatkänti.

That’s how it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax wakisispa.
He couldn't do it.	Jupajj janiw puedkänti.
That, where to find it, where to find it!.	Ukax, kawkhans jikxatasi, kawkhans jikxatasi!.
Really, it’s worth it.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa.
And immediately he knew exactly what he wanted.	Ukat jankʼakiw kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
But, it’s not like that.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkiti.

He had no idea what he was going to do about it.	Kunsa uka toqet lurani uk janiw jupajj amuykänti.
And he was like that.	Ukat jupax ukhamänwa.
I didn't want him.	Nayajj janiw jupar munkayätti.
So what is he again.	Ukhamajj kunas jupajj wasitat.
He knew it all too well.	Jupajj wali sumwa uk yatïna.

But he was very cautious.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti.
Now here’s why.	Jichhax akax kunatsa.
There is nothing here.	Janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
No, he wants to eat, he says.	Janiwa, manq’añ muni, sasaw saraki.

So he never said much to her.	Ukhamajj janipuniw jupar sinti siskänti.
He has no idea what to do.	Jupajj kuna lurañas wakisispa uk janiw amuykiti.
But it cannot last much longer.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkaspati.

It’s up to you to do it yourself.	Ukax juma pachpaw lurañama.

He knew it, somehow, he knew it well.	Jupax uk yatïna, kunjamatsa, jupax sum yatïna.
I wonder what he has done.	Kunsa jupajj lurawayi sasaw jisktʼasta.
But there is nothing that can be done about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka toqet lurañjamäkiti.
I don’t want that for anyone.	Janiw khitirus ukham munkti.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.

Something else needs to be done.	Yaqha lurañaw wakisi.
But that is not the case today.	Ukampis jichhürunakan janiw ukhamäkiti.
I can’t do this at all.	Nayax janiw akax kuns lurañjamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he didn't know that.	Ukampis janiw uk yatkänti.
But I did it for a long time.	Ukampis walja tiempow ukham lurawayta.
A book however.	Mä libro ukampis.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I had no idea what was going on there.	Kunsa ukan luraskäna uk janiw yatkayätti.
So there is no need to do anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns lurañajj wakiskiti.

There’s nothing you can do about it.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I don't know why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw yatkti.

So there is nothing to do.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.

That’s not the case, of course.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
You think you want to see it.	Jumax uñjañ munta sasaw amuyta.

But he never did anything about it.	Ukampis janipuniw uka toqet kuns lurkänti.

He never did that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk lurkänti.
But these were not the case.	Ukampis ukanak lurañajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He had no idea how long that would last.	Ukajj qawqha tiempos utjani uk janiw amuykänti.

That’s what made him think.	Ukaw jupar amuyäna.
That means a lot.	Ukajj walpun sañ muni.
That didn't mean anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But that was obviously his intention.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw jupajj amtäna.
He felt comfortable.	Jupajj sum jikjjatasïna.
Not the guy .	Janiw uka waynax .

I really think he deserves it.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukham lurañaw wakisi sasaw amuyta.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkänti.
Now he was very happy.	Jichhajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

He had just bought the place.	Jupajj jichhakiw uka cheq alasïna.
But he was still in a state of shock.	Ukampis jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
And so it is every day.	Ukat ukhamarakiw sapa uru.

Both are impossible.	Panpachaniw jan lurañjamäkiti.
That is not the case today.	Jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He understood it perfectly.	Jupajj sumwa amuyäna.
Really, it’s worth it.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa.

It’s not that kind of night.	Janiw uka kasta arumax utjkiti.

You know, we don’t even have to do that.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw ukham lurañas wakiskiti.

That's not the way it works.	Ukham lurasajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m going to say that.	Nayax ukham sañ munta.
This was not what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
So he did that.	Ukhamajj ukham luräna.
Today, it is no different.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
Today was a lot of fun.	Jichhürojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

Do you think it’s worth it?.	Jumax amuyta ukax wali askiwa?.
This is certainly not the case.	Chiqpachansa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't seem too bad.	Jupajj janiw sinti jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamäkänti.
It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.
But he was very uncomfortable.	Ukampis jupajj wali jan sumwa jikjjatasïna.

He’s a very bad guy.	Jupax wali jan wali jaqiwa.
Something needs to be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunsa lurañaw wakisi.

But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
No, he didn't want one, he said.	Janiwa, janiw mä munkänti, sasaw säna.
He wanted a drink.	Jupax mä umañ munäna.

Both are doable.	Panpachaniw lurañjamäkiti.

There is nothing more you can do.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañjamäkiti.

And he didn’t do that.	Ukat janiw ukham lurkänti.
There’s really nothing you can do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He doesn’t understand what it is.	Jupax janiw kunas uk amuykiti.
No one knows anything about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet kuns yatkiti.
He was going all out and everything was happening like that.	Jupax taqi ch’amampiw sarnaqäna ukat taqi kunas ukham luraskäna.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.

Over and over and over again.	Walja kutiw walja kuti ukat walja kuti.
Why, this is a wonderful man.	Kunatsa, akax wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.

He’s a little too excited.	Jupax mä juk’a sinti kusisitaw jikxatasi.
It did no more than that.	Ukajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurkänti.
It feels like that.	Ukajj ukham jikjjatasi.
There is plenty of time.	Walja tiempow utji.
No one knew exactly what caused it.	Kunas ukham luräna uk janiw khitis sum yatkänti.

You are the best person for me.	Jumax nayatakix wali suma jaqiwa.

And this, many times every day.	Ukat akax, walja kutiw sapa uru.

Now it’s clear.	Jichhax qhanaw amuyasi.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
That’s not good enough for me.	Ukax nayatakix janiw askïkiti.
But he knows it well.	Ukampis jupajj uk sum yati.
He felt that there was nothing he could do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati sasaw amuyasïna.
He wasn't sure why, but he knew it.	Kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti, ukampis uk yatïna.

He agreed with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw iyaw säna.

And so it happened, of course.	Ukat ukhamaw pasäna, chiqpachansa.

It’s a human being.	Ukax mä jaqiwa.
I’m a little disappointed.	Nayax mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatastxa.

They’re good about it.	Jupanakax uka tuqitx wali askiwa.

He was very quick and alert.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna ukat wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I very nearly did that.	Nayax wali niyaw ukham lurawayta.

I'm not sure.	Nayax yattwa.
But one day it will!.	Ukampis ¡mä urux ukham lurani!.
I just can’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
This is not necessary at all .	Ukax janiw kunjamatsa wakiskiti .
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
Maybe you feel lonely.	Inas sapak jikjjatasta.
You are a very nice guy.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurkänti.
But he didn't really do that.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun ukham lurkänti.

That’s what.	Ukax kuna.
That’s why he used to do it.	Ukatwa ukham lurañ yatïna.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas uk siskänti.

You do everything on your own.	Jumax taqi kuns sapakiw lurasma.

Not really, no.	Janiw chiqpachansa, janiwa.

But not the other way around.	Ukampis janiw yaqha tuqitxa.
And I don’t need it.	Ukat nayatakix janiw wakiskiti.
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
But it doesn’t really have to be that way.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañax wakiskiti.

He never knew how he was doing financially.	Kunjamsa qollqe toqet jikjjatasïna uk janipuniw yatkänti.

So these are the things that need to be done.	Ukhamajj ukanak lurañaw wakisi.

And he immediately refused to do so.	Ukat jankʼakiw jan ukham lurañ munäna.

He didn't know how to do it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkänti.

But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
He is a very happy person.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
But he knew better than that.	Ukampis jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatïna.
So I never thought of it.	Ukhamajj janipuniw amuyirïkti.

He will make the decision.	Jupaw uka amtar purini.

How does he feel about it?.	¿Kunjamsa jupajj uka toqet amuyi?.
He doesn't understand you.	Jupajj janiw jumar amuykiti.

There is nothing to do right now.	Jichhax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

There’s nothing about it.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitx utjkiti.
He didn't want to do such a bad thing.	Janiw ukham jan walinak lurañ munkänti.

He didn't know what to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk janiw yatkänti.
But he had done a lot of bad things.	Ukampis jupajj walja jan walinak luratayna.
He did exactly that.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw uk luratayna.
He knew something.	Jupax kuns yatïna.

That’s how he saw it anyway.	Ukhamaw jupax kunjamatsa uñjäna.
I thought there would be only one.	Mä sapakiw utjani sasaw amuyayäta.

It’s called permission.	Ukax permiso satawa.
Or this .	Jan ukajj aka .
No, that wasn't the case.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

I want to stay here.	Nayax akan qhiparañ munta.

Tom is definitely not.	Tom jupax chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s done that to everyone.	Taqiniruw ukham lurawayi.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.

He saw something.	Jupajj kunsa uñjäna.

He doesn't think he can do anything about it.	Jupajj janiw kunsa uka toqet lurañapatak amuykiti.
Now, it’s better.	Jichhax, juk’amp askiwa.
He had no idea where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk janiw amuykänti.
And then that’s it.	Ukat ukat ukax ukhamawa.
I’m just saying that.	Nayax ukhamakiw siskta.

I’ve done it.	Nayax uk lurawayta.
He’ll do it for you.	Jupaw uk lurani.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He didn't want to say that.	Jupajj janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
And that is impossible.	Ukat ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
Today, he is doing the same.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukhamarakiw jupajj luraski.
Not what he did.	Janiw kuntï jupajj lurkäna ukhamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think there’s something to it.	Nayax amuyta ukax kunas utji.
But nothing more can be done.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkaspati.
I can’t remember why.	Nayax janiw kunatsa uk amtaskti.
He seemed unaware of it.	Jupajj janis uk yatkaspa ukhamänwa.

It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.

Now he wants to talk to both of them.	Jichhax panpachaniw parltʼañ muni.
Very comfortable and very sturdy.	Wali suma ukat wali ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
That's what it means.	Ukham sañ muni.

But not the other way around.	Ukampis janiw yaqha tuqitxa.

You can’t do that here.	Janiw akan ukham lurañjamäkiti.
This isn’t what you want.	Akax janiw kuntix jumax munkta ukhamäkiti.

He wanted to do something.	Jupajj kuns lurañwa munäna.

That was not the case with me.	Nayampejj janiw ukhamäkänti.

Tomorrow is better.	Qhipürux juk’amp askiwa.

He wanted to know everything about me.	Jupajj nayat taqe kun yatiñ munäna.
But that is not necessary now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
But he wanted to do something wrong.	Ukampis jupajj jan walinak lurañwa munäna.
I’m sorry, I can’t have this.	Nayax llakistwa, janiw akax utjkaspati.
It is much better to do so.	Ukham lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa.
It’s so worth it.	Ukham wali askiwa.

It almost didn’t happen.	Niya janiw ukhamäkänti.

He knows how you feel.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sum yati.

No, there was nothing like that.	Janiwa, janiw kunas ukham utjkänti.
This is not very useful.	Ukajj janiw sinti askïkiti.

It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
That’s why it happened.	Ukatwa ukham pasäna.
But he knew he had to do better than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurañapa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He did this, almost every day.	Ukhamwa luräna, niya sapa uru.
That is why he wanted to talk to you.	Ukatwa jupajj jumamp parltʼañ munäna.
There is nothing to do in the country.	Uka markanx janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

He was always curious.	Jupajj sapa kutiw yatiñ munäna.
Really, really.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
I don't want any more.	Janiw jukʼamp munkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
It’s a nice guy.	Mä suma jaqiwa.
And there is nothing better to do.	Ukat janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañax utjkiti.
He doesn't know how to use it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ yatkiti.
Or who actually did something.	Jan ukajj khitis cheqpachapun kuns luräna.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

He said he was in love.	Jupax munasiñampiw jikxatasi sasaw säna.

To be honest, the opposite is true.	Chiqpachansa, uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
You can’t do that .	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti .
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I think I need to do that now.	Nayax amuyta, jichhax uk lurañaw wakisi.
But he was still sad.	Ukampis wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.

He doesn't know when it will happen, but he knows it will.	Kunapachas pasani uk janiw yatkiti, ukampis ukajj pasani uk sum yati.

I guess there’s nothing much to do.	Nayax amuyta janiw kunas sinti lurañax utjkiti.
I didn’t think so.	Janiw nayax ukham amuyirïkti.
I didn’t do anything.	Nayax janiw kuns lurkti.
He thought he was a good man.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa sasaw amuyäna.
And he said he had no choice.	Ukat janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti sasaw säna.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I never wanted to buy one.	Janipuniw mä alañ munkti.
I think yesterday anyway.	Nayax qharüruw kunjamatsa amuyta.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn’t know how to do it.	Kunjamsa lurañapa uk janiw yatkiti.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
No one told him.	Janiw khitis jupar siskänti.
He can do things on his own.	Jupa pachpaw kuns luraspa.
He said it to himself.	Jupa pachpaw säna.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
There was nowhere to go in this regard.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kawkirus sarañax utjkänti.
You may need to do this several times.	Inas walja kuti ukham lurañax wakischispa.
This is another person.	Akax yaqha jaqiwa.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw uk luräna.
I never did prison time.	Janipuniw carcelan tiempo lurkti.
I was the only one who did it.	Naya sapakiw uk lurawayta.
I don't want any more.	Janiw jukʼamp munkti.

You're the one who knows.	Jumax yatisktawa.

I know how to do it.	Nayax kunjams lurañ yatta.
That’s the thing.	Ukax ukhamawa.

And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
They don’t need to.	Jupanakax janiw wakiskiti.
No, not really.	Janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa.

He couldn't do it now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj uk lurañ puedkänti.
He didn’t say why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa siskänti.
That may be the case.	Ukajj inas ukhamaraki.

This should be done over and over and over again.	Ukax walja kutiw walja kuti lurañapa.
I understand why he did it.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk sum amuyta.
I just wanted to talk about it.	Jichhakiw uka toqet parlañ munta.
Not that night.	Janiw uka arumax.
The reason for this was obvious.	Ukajj kunatsa ukham pasäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

But again, it wasn't.	Ukampis mayampsa janiw ukhamäkänti.

That’s what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj munäna.

No one really knows for sure.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't do anything in a house.	Jupajj janiw mä utan kuns lurkänti.
It was a love affair.	Ukajj munasiñampiw sarnaqäna.
He had a bad attitude.	Jupax jan wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
There’s something there.	Ukanx kunas utji.
And he saw what it was.	Ukat kunas uk uñjäna.
How he loves her.	Kunjamsa jupar munasi.
There was no need to hurry.	Janiw jankʼak lurañajj wakiskänti.
The first night he didn’t notice.	Nayrïr arumax janiw amuyaskänti.
A few times a day is not enough.	Mä qhawqha kuti urux janiw wakiskiti.
It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.

He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
No one was ever too bad.	Janipuniw khitis sinti jan walinak utjkänti.
He’s going to be very strong.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw saraski.

And you really can’t do that.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I don’t say anything.	Janiw kuns siskti.
No one did anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkänti.
He didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkänti.
Time goes by so fast.	Tiempojj wali jankʼakiw pasaski.
I will definitely be doing this again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wasitat aka lurañax utjani.

And he wasn’t alone.	Ukat janiw sapakix ukham lurkänti.
No one else did that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
Maybe another way .	Inas yaqha tuqitxa .
He’s got a lot of energy.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
Without a reason.	Jan kunatsa.
It wasn’t necessary.	Janiw wakiskänti.
He’s a very bad guy.	Jupax wali jan wali jaqiwa.

The sooner you do it, the better.	Jankʼak lurasma ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
Or, without, without.	Jan ukax, jan ukax, jan ukax.
He moved to the scene immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka cheqar sarjjäna.
I’m pretty excited about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I know you mean well.	Nayax yattwa jumax sum sañ munta.

He wasn't sure how to react.	Jupajj kunjamsa kuns lurani uk janiw sum yatkänti.
He’s a really nice guy.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw wali suma jaqiwa.
I didn’t see him that night.	Uka arumax janiw jupar uñjkti.
I hope to see you again one day.	Mä urux wasitat uñjañ suyt’askta.
He didn't say anything about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns siskänti.
They have nothing to do with it.	Jupanakax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
Not so much, he says.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, sasaw saraki.
He didn't say it, but he didn't.	Jupajj janiw uk siskänti, ukampis janiw siskänti.
I know that’s it.	Nayax uk yattwa.
I want to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ munta.
I wanted to tell him that.	Nayajj jupar ukham yatiyañ munta.
He didn't want to buy everything I wanted.	Jupajj janiw taqe kuntï munkta uk alañ munkänti.
I think otherwise.	Nayax yaqha tuqit amuyta.
Every day, too.	Sapa uru, ukhamaraki.

He was the one who decided it.	Jupaw uk amtäna.
He lives with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw jakasi.
He loves to talk.	Jupajj parlañ wal muni.

He’s just so excited.	Jupax ukhamakiw wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I can’t say I didn’t care.	Janiw nayax janiw kuns lurkti sañjamäkiti.
They don’t exist.	Jupanakax janiw utjkiti.
He never needed that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukajj wakiskänti.
He is the only one.	Jupa sapakiw utji.
There is nothing here.	Janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
So that's what it is.	Ukhamajj ukajj ukhamawa.
I just don't like it.	Nayajj janiw ukajj gustkituti.
Not about that.	Janiw uka tuqitxa.
What he wanted would not be there.	Kuntï munkäna ukajj janiw utjkaspati.

I never really wanted more than that.	Janipuniw chiqpachansa ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkti.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.

Not like he was.	Janiw kunjamtï jupajj utjkänti.
There was never anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham kunas utjkänti.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.
He seemed to be such a person.	Jupajj ukham jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I want these things.	Nayax ukanak munta.
This guy never did anything right.	Aka waynax janipuniw kuns sum lurkänti.
He obviously didn't want to tell her.	Jupajj janiw uk yatiyañ munkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

Maybe you should go to town.	Inas markar sarañax wakischispa.
For a long time he did not know.	Walja tiempow jupajj jan yatkänti.

This is something that needs to be done every day.	Ukajj sapa uru lurañaw wakisi.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
You, at least.	Jumax, mä juk’a.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luräna.
I didn’t know that.	Janiw nayax uk yatkayätti.
He said it was good for you.	Jumatakix wali askiwa sasaw säna.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parlañ munkiti.
I never wanted to see it again.	Janipuniw mayamps uñjañ munkayätti.
He really didn't want to talk about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit parlañ munkänti.
I didn’t understand it.	Janiw uk amuykayätti.

Well, he didn't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj ukham lurkänti.

There is a lot of value in doing this.	Uk lurañajj wali askiwa.

And he’s with you.	Ukat jupax jumamp chika.
He has to do both.	Jupax panpachaniw lurañapa.

Here’s why .	Akax kunatsa .
Wherever, whatever you do.	Kawkhansa, kunsa lurasma.
I don’t like this one at all.	Nayax janiw akax kuns gustkituti.
He wanted it badly enough.	Jupajj jan walpun munäna.
Now he knows what to do.	Jichhajj kunsa lurañapa uk sum yati.
He was in love with her.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw jikjjatasïna.
Today was not a bad day.	Jichhürunakanxa, janiw jan wali urux utjkänti.
I think it’s better on such a day.	Nayax amuyta, ukham urux juk’amp askiwa.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
But it is so.	Ukampis ukhamawa.
You have to do it both ways.	Panpachaniw uk lurañama.
He knew exactly what I was thinking.	Jupajj kuntï nayajj amuykta uk sum yatïna.
I know that it was.	Ukhamänwa uk yattwa.
Or so he said.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj säna.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns puedkänti.
But he was depressed.	Ukampis jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna.

So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I think it’s a person.	Nayax amuyta, ukax mä jaqiwa.
But he was very cautious.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I know that for myself.	Naya pachpaw uk yatta.
No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.

So there is no need to do that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
He walked with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw sarnaqäna.

To be honest, he felt the same way.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïna.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luräna.
He seemed unsure of what to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapa uk janis sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
No one really knew what it was.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni kunas uk yatkänti.

Actually, that was it.	Chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamänwa.

He has done much better.	Jupajj wal jukʼamp sum lurawayi.

He didn't like them any less.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa jupanakar jukʼamp munkänti.
He says he knows nothing about it.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit kuns yatkti sasaw saraki.
He refused to share it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatiyañ munkänti.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It was a very sad experience for me.	Nayatakejj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I know exactly how.	Kunjamsa uk sum yatta.

But he refused to do so.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
I really think this is interesting.	Chiqpachansa akax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I just saw him recently.	Jichhakiw jupar uñjta.
They are not .	Jupanakax janiw .
That is what he decided to do.	Ukaw jupajj amtäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Why did he decide to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ amtäna.
I don't know.	Janiw yatkti.
I know a little bit.	Nayax yattwa mä juk’a.
But he didn’t really want to.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun munkänti.
Anyway, that’s what happened.	Kawkhansa, ukax ukhamaw pasäna.

He decided to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurañ amtäna.
And that’s exactly what it means.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw ukax sañ muni.
Anyway, that’s right.	Kawkhansa, ukhamawa.
And he didn't do anything.	Ukat janiw kuns lurkänti.
And he really doesn't know what to do with me.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kunsa nayamp lurañap yatkiti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

But when he did, he didn't say so.	Ukampis ukham luräna ukhajja, janiw ukham siskänti.

What is he supposed to do.	Kunas jupajj lurañapa.
I feel that way .	Nayax ukham amuyasta .
I love him so much.	Nayajj jupar wal munta.
Maybe this whole thing needs to be done.	Inas aka taqpach lurañax wakischispa.
Nothing more needs to be done.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj wakiskiti.
But my own self.	Ukampis nayan pachpa.

You’re a bad guy.	Jumax mä jan wali jaqiwa.

He never did anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns lurkänti.
He agreed to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañatakiw iyaw säna.
He had no idea what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa amuykänti.
I want to talk about that a little bit.	Uka tuqitxa mä jukʼa parltʼañ munta.
He wanted to do everything.	Jupajj taqe kun lurañwa munäna.
He was never without.	Jupajj janipuniw jan ukajj utjkänti.
I worry about what he will do.	Kuntï jupajj lurani uka toqet llakistwa.
I am still happy to see that.	Uk uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He doesn’t want to know anywhere.	Jupax janiw kawkirus yatiñ munkiti.
The timing is worth it.	Uka tiempojj wali askiwa.

But he refused to go.	Ukampis janiw sarañ munkänti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But there is no need to do anything wrong.	Ukampis janiw kuna jan walinak lurañas wakiskiti.
I definitely think there’s something there.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukanx kunas utji sasaw amuyta.

There was no way to do that.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurañajj utjkänti.

He’s a human being.	Jupax jaqiwa.

He drinks a lot of coffee.	Jupax walja café umañ muni.
He was eager to help out at all costs.	Jupajj jan kunatsa yanaptʼañ wal munäna.

You’re the one who thinks so.	Jumax ukham amuyta.

More immediately he ordered himself.	Jukʼamp jankʼakiw jupa pachpaw mayïna.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukanak lurañ munkti.
But he couldn't do anything about it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
What is the source?.	¿Kunas utji?.
Both of you are .	Panpachaniw jumanakax .
I didn’t know anything.	Janiw kuns yatkayätti.

I didn't want to tell him that.	Janiw nayajj ukham jupar yatiyañ munkayätti.
I clearly understood.	Nayajj qhanaw amuyayäta.

You know that, you know.	Jumax uk yatisktawa.
I wonder how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
He’s just doing it.	Jupax ukhamakiw luraski.
Never the other way around.	Janipuniw yaqha tuqitxa.
One day, one day.	Mä uru, mä uru.
I want something.	Nayax kuns munta.

That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
How do you feel about all of this?.	¿Kunjamsa jumajj taqe ukanak uñjasajj jikjjatasta?.
And so he will.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupajj lurani.
But he meant it.	Ukampis uk sañ munäna.
She said that was a good thing.	Ukajj wali askiwa sasaw jupajj säna.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.

It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he didn't think so.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuykänti.
I know everything about it.	Nayax taqi kun yattwa.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
He knew he didn't.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti uk sum yatïna.

So somehow .	Ukhamajj kunjamatsa .
I didn't know what to do about it.	Uka toqet kun lurañsa janiw yatkayätti.
But somewhere he saw her.	Ukampis kawkhansa jupar uñjäna.
It was never necessary.	Janipuniw wakiskänti.
And he’s right about it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
In both cases.	Uka pä tuqitxa.
I don't know exactly when he left.	Kunapachas sarjjäna uk janiw sum yatkti.

So it's a good thing.	Ukhamajj wali askiwa.
He told me that.	Jupaw ukham sitäna.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
He loves to talk.	Jupajj parlañ wal muni.
It certainly was for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix ukhamänwa.
That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
But really, it’s not.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.

But that hasn’t happened yet.	Ukampis ukax janiw jichhakamax ukhamäkiti.
It’s not a bad thing to do.	Janiw jan walinak lurañax wali askïkiti.
Or has done so.	Jan ukajj ukham lurawayi.
So he decided to do something about it.	Ukatwa uka toqet kuns lurañ amtäna.
Ugly, but effective.	Jan wali, ukampis wali askiwa.
She immediately felt a little better.	Ukat jankʼakiw mä jukʼa sum jikjjatasïna.

He’s not like that, not at all.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw kunjamatsa.
But he moved quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
It’s always there.	Ukax sapa kutiw utji.
I don't know why anyone would do that.	Kunatsa khitis ukham luraspa uk janiw yatkti.

He is a very nice person to me.	Jupajj nayatakejj wali suma jaqewa.
Nice and long.	Suma ukat jaya.
Why did he do that.	Kunatsa ukham luratayna.
He said he was happy to talk.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw parlañ munta sasaw säna.
I doubt it will happen.	Ukajj pasani sasaw pächasta.
That's what he said.	Ukhamaw jupajj säna.

I will never do that again.	Janiw mayamps ukham lurkäti.

But it doesn’t exist yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
But I didn’t see it.	Ukampis janiw uñjkti.

And he knew it well.	Ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
And, of course, it was.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.
I would have to do that.	Nayajj ukham lurañaw wakisispa.
He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
He knew what he was doing.	Jupajj kunsa luraskäna uk sum yatïna.

But he wanted nothing more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkänti.
I don't believe that.	Nayajj janiw uk creykti.
He went away on his own.	Jupa pachpaw sarjjäna.
And there was nothing.	Ukat janiw kunas utjkänti.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It’s a good thing for you.	Jumatakix wali askiwa.
The guy really got over it.	Uka waynax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitx jikxatasïna.
The day came a little too soon.	Uka urux mä juk’a jank’akiw purini.
You have both of them.	Panpachaniw jumanakan utji.
He wanted to see it.	Jupajj uk uñjañ wal munäna.
He didn't understand all of this.	Jupajj janiw taqe ukanak amuykänti.
I want to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ munta.
Didn't think it was possible.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakisispa sasin amuykänti.
He really didn’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkänti.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
But it never happened.	Ukampis janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He did not know how long it had been.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatkänti.
That’s how it feels.	Ukhamaw jikxatasi.
I did that today.	Jichhüruw ukham lurawayta.
Nothing serious to say.	Janiw kunas wali jach’a sañjamäkiti.
Something wrong, something wrong.	Kunas jan wali, kuna jan wali.
But that was clearly not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munasi.
He bought time.	Jupajj tiempo alasïna.
Or is it a ? 	¿Jan ukax?
It took him even longer.	Ukat jukʼamp tiempow jupar pasäna.
He doesn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
He immediately declined.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uk jan säna.
Can’t do it here.	Janiw akan lurañjamäkiti.
I don’t know how to do that.	Nayax janiw kunjams uk lurañ yatkti.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
A little .	Mä juk'a .
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
he said to himself.	sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
I'm still not about that.	Nayax wali jan uka tuqitxa.
He’s feeling pretty good.	Jupax wali sum jikxatasi.
I am doing much better.	Nayajj jukʼamp sumwa luraskta.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa janiw yatkänti.
I think I’ll need it soon.	Nayax amuyta, jank’akiw ukax munasini.
He didn't say anything to them.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupanakar siskänti.
Honestly, that’s what I like.	Chiqpachansa, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It can’t be there.	Janiw utjkaspati.
Now I won't do anything wrong.	Jichhajj jan nayajj jan wal lurkäti.
I know that's it.	Nayajj uk yattwa.
He knew a little better.	Mä jukʼa sum yatïna.
I want to eat there.	Nayax ukan manq’añ munta.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
He did not know how long it had been.	Uka tiempojj qhawqha tiempos pasäna uk janiw yatkänti.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
It’s good for anyone.	Ukax khitirus wali askiwa.
It all happened so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He doesn’t like that.	Jupax janiw ukax askïkiti.
I refused again.	Nayajj wasitatwa nayajj jan munkti.
No one knew anything for sure.	Janiw khitis kuns sum yatkänti.
He was never like that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I know he didn’t.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw ukham lurkänti.
It will arrive tomorrow.	Ukax qharüruw purini.
But now it seemed necessary.	Ukampis jichhajj ukham lurañajj wakisispa ukhamwa amuyasïna.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think he really loves this.	Nayax amuyta jupax chiqpachans akax walpun munasi.
Or with anyone else.	Jan ukax khitimpis.
Doesn’t want to eat anything, alone.	Janiwa kunsa manq’añ munkiti, sapaki.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
He didn't have that.	Jupajj janiw ukham utjkänti.
Tom knew it all too well.	Tom jilatajj uk sum yatïna.
That’s even better.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa.
I didn’t want to say anything to him.	Nayax janiw jupar kuns sañ munkti.
It was already like that.	Nayratpach ukhamänwa.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I feel the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta.
Like there was nothing.	Kunjamtï jan kunas utjkänti.
He never did that now.	Jichhajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
That’s what makes me happy.	Ukaw kusisit jikjjatasi.
And now, this .	Ukat jichhax, aka .
He didn't know exactly how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.
Or he thought it necessary.	Jan ukajj wakisispa ukhamwa amuyäna.
How I still want to know.	Kunjamsa wali yatiñ munta.
No one really knows what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatkiti.
But nobody wants that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk munkiti.
But that’s good for you.	Ukampis ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
And for all the reasons.	Ukat taqi kunatsa ukham lurañax wakisispa.
No it wasn’t.	Janiwa janiw ukhamäkänti.
So today is the day.	Ukhamajj jichhüruw uka uru.
I don’t know yet.	Janiw jichhakamax yatkti.
There was no one there.	Janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
He’s obviously a guy.	Jupax qhanaw mä waynax.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
That means only one thing.	Ukajj mä sapakiw sañ muni.
There is no such thing.	Ukax janiw utjkiti.
But I never said anything to him.	Ukampis janipuniw jupar kuns siskti.
Much bigger, actually.	Walja jach’a, chiqpachansa.
But this, this wasn’t the case.	Ukampis aka, akax janiw ukhamäkänti.
This is often not the case.	Ukajj walja kutiw jan ukhamäkiti.
I’m pretty sure he did.	Nayax wali sum yatta, jupax ukham luratayna.
You guys need to do that.	Jumanakajj ukham lurañaw wakisi.
But I like it that way.	Ukampis nayatakix ukham wali askiwa.
Or he can do something.	Jan ukajj kunsa luraspa.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kunas lurañax utjkiti.
But there was nothing, nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkänti, janiw kunas utjkänti.
He was a wonderful character.	Jupajj wali muspharkañ sarnaqäna.
Large and spacious.	Jach’a ukat jach’a.
It’s been around for a long time.	Ukax wali jaya pachaw utji.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I had no idea whatsoever.	Nayajj janiw kunsa amuyirïkti.
And he’s not like that.	Ukat jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
The .	Ukax .
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
No one knew why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
I know now that he has no idea.	Jupajj janiw kunsa amuykiti, uk jichhajj yattwa.
And that, of course, is what I like.	Ukat ukax, chiqpachansa, nayatakix wali askiwa.
I saw him, the other night.	Nayax jupar uñjta, yaqha arumax.
You’re welcome.	Jumax wali askiwa.
He didn't want to talk about anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa parlañ munkänti.
Well, that doesn't mean anything.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj kuns sañ munkiti.
You can’t do what you want to do here.	Janiw kuntï akan lurañ munkta uk lurañjamäkiti.
My only .	Nayan sapakiw .
It takes three days.	Kimsa uruw wakisi.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham uñjkti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But who knows for sure.	Ukampis khitis chiqpachapuni yati.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
I have said it myself many times.	Naya pachpaw walja kuti sista.
It’s already getting more and more intense.	Nayratpach juk’amp juk’amp ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
That’s exactly what it is.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa.
But I want to do that.	Ukampis nayajj ukham lurañwa munta.
It started again.	Ukajj wasitatwa qalltäna.
He wanted it.	Jupajj uk munäna.
But he wasn't there.	Ukampis janiw jupajj utjkänti.
There is no .	Ukax mä .
No one understood.	Janiw khitis amuykänti.
That was happening again.	Ukaw wasitat luraskäna.
That's what he thinks.	Ukhamaw jupajj amuyi.
You don’t need to do that.	Jumax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He had no idea what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk janiw amuykänti.
He doesn't want to see it.	Jupajj janiw uñjañ munkiti.
But that's the way it is.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamawa.
What he was doing there.	Kuntï jupajj ukan luraskäna.
I don't understand why.	Kunatsa uk janiw amuykti.
I don’t want to say anything.	Nayax janiw kuns sañ munkti.
Everything is happening now.	Taqi kunas jichhax luraski.
That he didn't understand.	Ukajj janiw jupajj amuykänti.
On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
It’s still there.	Ukax wali ch’amampiw ukan jikxatasi.
That is not the case now.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.

I don’t see it.	Janiw uñjkti.
And he saw it for himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw uñjäna.
He really didn't mean it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk sañ munkänti.
In that case, somehow.	Uka tuqitxa, kunjamatsa.
That means big money.	Ukax jach’a qullqi sañ muni.
We know a sum.	Uk sum yatta.
He was still in a state of shock.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he couldn't do it.	Ukat janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
But I wonder how long that will last.	Ukampis ukajj qhawqha tiempos utjani sasaw jisktʼasta.
And indeed, it is.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
He is in your presence.	Jupaw jumanakan utji.
And very quickly, in fact.	Ukat wali jank’akiw, chiqpachansa.
They don’t exist.	Jupanakax janiw utjkiti.
He didn't quite know that.	Jupajj janiw uk sum yatkänti.
I never quite knew what he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk janipuniw sum yatkti.
I just want to be like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw munta.
But beyond that, there was nothing.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw kunas utjkänti.
He’s a bad guy.	Jupax mä jan wali jaqiwa.
You can do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk lurasma.
There was nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkänti.
He always saw her.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jupar uñjäna.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
You thought so too.	Jumax ukhamarakiw amuyayäta.
And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
I don’t really know.	Janiw chiqpachapuni yatkti.
But there is a good time.	Ukampis mä suma tiempow utji.
But no one had done that before.	Ukampis janiw khitis nayrajj ukham lurkänti.
He had moved to another country.	Jupajj yaqha markaruw sarjjäna.
Repeat the process.	Uka tuqitxa wasitatwa lurañama.
You understand that.	Jumax uk amuyasta.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
It’s been a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw jikxatasïna.
But there was no one to do it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurañapatak utjkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have nothing to do with it.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti.
He wants nothing to do with me.	Jupax janiw nayamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
He said you know.	Jupax yatisktawa sasaw säna.
He was so happy to see her.	Jupar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He was partially right.	Jupajj mä jukʼa cheqapuniw säna.
He doesn't like them.	Jupanakajj janiw jupar gustkiti.
I want to stay alone.	Nayax sapak qhiparañ munta.
That’s even better.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa.
Half the school.	Chika yatiqañ uta.
He really needed help.	Jupajj cheqapuniw yanaptʼa munäna.
He’s still in pain.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
And no, it wasn’t two days.	Ukat janiw, janiw pä urux utjkänti.

Is that really possible? 	¿Chiqapunit ukham lurañax wakisispa?
That wasn’t here.	Ukax janiw akan utjkänti.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa jan yatkänti.
That’s what he did.	Ukhamaw jupajj luräna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't do these things.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurkänti.
About the .	Uka tuqitxa .
He’s a good guy, you know.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
Whatever the need.	Kunas wakisispa.
So it happened very quickly.	Ukhamajj wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
And he didn't want to know about it.	Ukat janiw uka toqet yatiñ munkänti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
And another thing.	Ukat yaqha tuqitxa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj wal munäna.
That wasn't exactly what he said.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun siskänti.
I guess that doesn’t mean.	Nayax amuyta, ukax janiw sañ munkiti.
It quickly became apparent.	Jankʼakiw ukham amuyasïna.
But I don’t think so.	Ukampis janiw ukham siskti.
Isn't that the case now.	¿Janit jichhajj ukajj ukhamäki.

But it’s not all that.	Ukampis janiw taqe kunas ukhamäkiti.
I want him to do something.	Jupaw kuns lurañapatak munta.

But really, that’s what I like.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I wonder what happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
I don't know anything about it.	Janiw uka toqet kuns yatkti.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
There’s nothing like that.	Janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
I see where this is going.	Ukajj kawkirus saraski uk uñjta.
It was a lonely journey.	Ukajj sapakiw sarnaqäna.
That is why it takes time.	Ukatwa tiempojj munasi.
Now there was nothing else to do.	Jichhajj janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.

You might, but you definitely do.	Inas ukham lurasma, ukampis chiqpachapuniw uk lurasma.

There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.

¡There is nothing!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti!.

He told me he never wanted to see me again.	Jupajj janipuniw mayamps uñjañ munkti sasaw sitäna.

But that was not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He politely agreed.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw iyaw säna.
He knew how to control me.	Jupajj kunjamsa nayar apnaqañ yatïna.
That’s really what it was.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamänwa.

Not that he isn't.	Janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
But it was still a good idea.	Ukampis wali sumwa amuyasïna.
But he didn't think so.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuykänti.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew it all along.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk yatïna.

I don’t remember it.	Janiw nayax amtaskti.
He acts like he does this every day.	Jupax sapa uru ukham luraski ukhamaw sarnaqäna.
He didn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurkänti.
He knew nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkänti.
So much the better.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa.
Also, you can do it yourself.	Ukhamaraki, juma pachpaw lurasma.
I think I think so.	Nayax ukham amuyta sasaw amuyta.

He said he wanted to buy it.	Jupax alañ munta sasaw säna.
You have to do it alone.	Jumax sapakiw lurañama.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he didn’t want to.	Ukampis janiw munkänti.
I’m doing all of these things.	Nayax taqi ukanak luraskta.
It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He didn't know everything.	Jupajj taqe kunsa janiw yatkänti.
He was nobody like that.	Jupajj janiw khitis ukhamäkänti.

I like that about it.	Uka tuqitxa nayatakix wali askiwa.
But he was doing better than me all day.	Ukampis jupajj taqe uruw nayat sipansa jukʼamp sum luraskäna.
I'm not sure how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uk janiw sum yatkti.
He has done well all along.	Jupajj taqe tiempow sum lurawayi.

Very, very lonely.	Wali, wali sapaki.

He didn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parlañ munkänti.

He’s kind of able to do it alone.	Jupax mä juk’a sapakiw uk lurañ yati.
No, it’s not, really.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
You want something more.	Jumax juk’amp kuns munta.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I never anticipated that.	Janipuniw uk nayratpach amuyirïkti.
That’s exactly what it’s about.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew what was going to happen.	Jupajj kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.
This is the big guy.	Akax jach’a jaqiwa.
The reason, you know.	Uka kunatsa, jumax yatisktawa.
And certainly not for me.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
He was the one who said that.	Jupaw ukham säna.
I hope there will be plenty of time to do so.	Ukham lurañatakix walja tiempow utjani sasaw suytʼaskta.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

Everything comes quickly.	Taqi kunas jank’akiw purini.
It wasn’t really you.	Janiw chiqpachansa jumax ukhamäkänti.
He was not himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpa ukhamäkänti.
That means it wasn’t midnight.	Ukax janiw chika arumax utjkänti sañ muni.
I’ve already seen one.	Nayax nayratpach mä uñjta.
Everything I disagree with you.	Taqi kunas jumamp jan iyaw sañjamäkiti.

Still everything was fine.	Wali taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I wonder what happened to me.	Kunas nayar pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
You’re right .	Jumax chiqpachapuniw .
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
And he clearly wasn't.	Ukat qhanaw jan jupajj ukhamäkänti.
But it will take some time.	Ukampis mä qhawqha tiempow munasini.

I don’t know what I really want to do.	Janiw nayax kuntï chiqpachapuni lurañ munkta uk yatkti.
I want to talk to you.	Nayajj jumamp parltʼañ munta.

It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He knows the language.	Jupax uka aru yati.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I’m the one who asked.	Nayax khitis jiskt’asta.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
So you have to act fast.	Ukhamajj jankʼakiw lurañama.
I didn’t see a thing.	Janiw mä kuns uñjkti.
But there is something necessary.	Ukampis kunas wakisi.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.

There is nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkiti.
But I don’t have it yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax nayatak utjkiti.
And it was for a long time.	Ukat walja tiempow ukhamänwa.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I didn't quite understand it.	Nayajj janiw uk sum amuyirïkti.
I didn’t know what to do.	Janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
He didn't know why he thought anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa kunsa amuyäna uk yatkänti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
A school night.	Mä yatiqañ utan arumax.
No one knows the answer.	Janiw khitis yatkiti.
Which is definitely wrong.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jan wali sañ muni.
But it’s him.	Ukampis jupaw.
He began to speak again.	Jupajj wasitatwa parlañ qalltäna.
And this is definitely not enough today.	Ukat akax chiqpachapuniw jichhürunakanx jan wakiskiti.

I am really looking forward to tomorrow.	Chiqpachansa qharüruw suytʼaskta.

That is what he meant.	Ukaw jupajj sañ munäna.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
That has nothing to do with me.	Ukax janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti.
There’s still a lot of energy.	Wali ch’amampiw utji.
You felt the same way.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasïna.
You know, that doesn’t mean who he is.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukax janiw khitis jupax uk sañ munkiti.
It’s always this .	Ukax sapa kutiw aka .

And of course .	Ukat chiqpachansa .

You’re welcome.	Jumax wali askiwa.
You’re a bad guy.	Jumax mä jan wali jaqiwa.

That’s not good, it’s not good at all.	Ukax janiw askïkiti, janiw kunas askïkiti.
But I don't believe it.	Ukampis nayajj janiw iyaw siskti.
I don't really like that.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj wal gustkituti.
He doesn’t know how to say it.	Jupax janiw kunjamsa uk sañ yatkiti.
And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
Nothing more than that.	Janiw kunas ukat sipansa.
Time, it just never seems like it.	Tiempo, ukhamakiw janipuniw ukax utjkaspati.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
He didn't really want one.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun mä munkänti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s very good to me.	Jupax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.

Maybe it’s worth doing.	Inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.

He doesn't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkiti.
But that happened.	Ukampis ukajj pasäna.
Or anyone else.	Jan ukax khitirus.
He decided to do something about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kun lurañwa amtäna.
There is only one.	Mä sapakiw utji.
He did what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna uk luräna.

This happened in two days.	Ukajj pä uruw pasäna.

Or so she told me.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj sitäna.
Not that it meant much.	Janiw ukajj walpun sañ munkänti.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
No, of course not.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s not enough for you.	Ukax janiw jumatakix wakiskiti.
But he seemed to know what was what.	Ukampis kunas kunas uk yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
But I just don’t know how.	Ukampis nayax janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkti.
I have seen it with him.	Nayajj jupamp chikaw uk uñjta.

He didn't want to go alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak sarañ munkänti.

And he didn’t want to.	Ukat janiw munkänti.
This is the best thing I’ve ever done.	Akax nayatakix wali askiwa.

He started, and so did he.	Jupajj qalltäna, jupajj ukhamarakiw qalltäna.

And he decides to do so.	Ukat ukham lurañ amti.
And indeed it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
You need to do that.	Jumax ukham lurañaw wakisi.
I really didn’t want to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk lurañ munkayätti.

But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.

To be honest, he didn't know much about it.	Chiqpachansa, janiw uka tuqit sum yatkänti.

He didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkänti.
He didn't want to go too early.	Jupajj janiw sinti alwat sarañ munkänti.

So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn't need it.	Nayajj janiw wakiskänti.
So pretty much it's all done.	Ukhamajj niyaw taqe ukanak lurawayi.

He wasn't sure what to do about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kunsa lurañapa uk janiw sum yatkänti.

So he took care of it himself.	Ukhamajj jupa pachpaw ukanak sum uñjäna.

They can’t have it both ways.	Jupanakax janiw uka pä tuqitx utjkaspati.

Nothing is very interesting.	Janiw kunas wali askïkiti.
I can't say for sure when that will happen.	Kunapachas ukajj pasani uk janiw cheqpachapun siskti.
He didn't say anything to them.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupanakar siskänti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He will do well here.	Jupajj akan sum lurani.

And so it should be.	Ukat ukhamarakiw lurañapa.
He felt something.	Jupajj kunsa jikjjatasïna.
It wasn't, he thought.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.

You just exist.	Jumax ukhamakiw utji.
Many times you can do both.	Walja kutiw uka pä tuqit lurasma.
But of course I know that’s not the case.	Ukampis chiqpachansa nayax yattwa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was something else.	Jupajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
He didn't understand now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj amuyaskänti.
And there’s no money.	Ukat janiw qullqix utjkiti.
He meant no, he knew it.	Jupax janiw sañ munäna, jupax uk yatïna.

Great, indeed.	Jach’a, chiqpachansa.

There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
About everything else, it is.	Taqi kuna tuqitxa, ukhamawa.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
You're a great guy.	Jumax jach'a jaqiwa.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know it's pretty good.	Nayax wali sum yatta.
But I don’t like anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitis nayar gustkituti.
I still use it.	Nayax wali apnaqañ yatta.
But he knew that wasn't enough.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He knows something.	Jupax kuns yati.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
Do it consistently and with the same speed.	Sapa kutiw lurañama ukat pachpa jankʼakiw lurañama.
It wasn't like that before.	Nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
So there was nothing I could do about it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas uka toqet lurañajj utjkänti.
He knew how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I don’t like that for some reason.	Nayatakix ukax janiw askïkiti kunatsa.
I just don’t know how.	Nayax janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
What do you think of	¿Kunas jumax .

He didn't say no.	Jupajj janiw janiw siskänti.
Maybe it's worth it.	Inas ukajj wakischispa.
I don’t want to use it.	Nayax janiw uka apnaqañ munkti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
But you understand well.	Ukampis jumax sum amuyta.

I don't want to eat anything.	Janiw kuns manq'añ munkti.
And how he went abroad.	Ukat kunjamsa jupajj yaqha markar saräna.
No, he didn't say all of that.	Janiwa, janiw ukanak taqe kuns siskänti.
But there is no shortage of time.	Ukampis janiw mä jukʼa tiempos utjkiti.
A couple of days.	Mä pä uru.
This is obviously not the case.	Ukax qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
He didn't know.	Jupajj janiw yatkänti.
He loves you so much.	Jupajj jumar wal munasi.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He wants to know everything.	Taqi kun yatiñ muni.
And that means everyone.	Ukat ukax taqiniruw sañ muni.
Does he really think so.	¿Chiqapunit ukham amuyi.
It’s not good for anyone.	Janiw khitirus wali askïkiti.
That is not the case .	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti .
It’s really worth it!.	¡Chiqpachansa wali askiwa!.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
And maybe that's the point.	Ukat inas uka tuqitxa ukham lurañapa.
And it happened a long time ago.	Ukat nayratpachaw pasäna.
And really, he didn’t.	Ukat chiqpachansa, janiw ukham lurkänti.
He didn't want her to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañap munkänti.
I did it anyway.	Nayax kunjamatsa uk lurawayta.
You can just do it at home.	Utan ukhamakiw lurasma.

That’s what it should do.	Ukaw ukham lurañapa.

He said he had none.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkituti sasaw säna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Either that’s good, or it’s not.	Jan ukax ukax wali askiwa, jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never thought it would do anything really bad.	Chiqpachansa jan walinak luraspa sasaw janipuniw amuyirïkti.

And it wasn't like that before.	Ukat janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.

He decided to go with her.	Jupampiw sarañ amtäna.
I have nothing to do here.	Janiw kuna lurañas akan utjkituti.

It’s not what you think it is.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.

That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There really is nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkiti.

It happened fairly quickly.	Ukax mä juk’a jank’akiw pasäna.

He knows all about it.	Jupajj taqe ukanak sum yati.

So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I understand that.	Nayax uk amuyasta.
I know he was.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukhamänwa.
It doesn’t need to be.	Janiw ukax wakiskiti.

And that was it.	Ukat ukajj ukhamänwa.

Overall, a great car.	Taqi kuna, mä jach’a auto.
He could not speak at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa parlañ puedkänti.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw lurañama.

He needed some help.	Jupajj mä jukʼa yanaptʼa munäna.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Don't be afraid	Janiw uka .
It was a little bit like that.	Mä jukʼa ukhamänwa.
I don’t want to believe it.	Nayax janiw iyaw sañ munkti.

Maybe he was doing this all wrong.	Inas jupax aka tuqit taqi jan walinak luraskäna.
But no one understood.	Ukampis janiw khitis amuykänti.

He didn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I really don’t know what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kun lurañsa yatkti.
To be honest, that’s not the case for me.	Chiqpachansa, ukax janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
He says he didn’t do that the other day.	Yaqha urux janiw ukham lurkti sasaw saraki.
He knew better.	Jupaw jukʼamp sum yatïna.
John did the job.	Juanajj uk luräna.

Everything happened.	Taqe kunas pasäna.

He’s still somewhere.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw kawkhans jikxatasi.
It’s not impossible.	Janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't want to do that.	Janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
He saw the wrong things.	Jupajj jan walinak uñjäna.
I don't know exactly how he feels about me.	Kunjamsa nayat jikjjatasi uk janiw sum yatkti.
That is what he meant.	Ukaw jupajj sañ munäna.
And he did it himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
I’m thinking of something.	Nayax kuns amuyta.
Do this three times.	Kimsa kutiw ukham lurañama.
I can't say what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw siskti.
He was very active.	Jupajj wal chʼamachasïna.

Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.

It doesn’t exist.	Janiw ukax utjkiti.
This is not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew the best about it.	Jupaw uka toqet wali sum yatïna.
I did not know about the same thing.	Nayajj janiw uka pachpa toqet yatkayätti.
He says it’s good.	Jupax wali askiwa sasaw saraki.
He didn’t know anything.	Jupax janiw kuns yatkänti.
He certainly did.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukham luräna.
I hope you do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ suyt’askta.
I prefer not to do that.	Nayajj jan uk lurañaw jukʼamp munta.
He was happier now.	Jichhajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He was a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali sumwa uñjäna.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
That time is never like that.	Uka tiempojj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
And money, of course.	Ukat qullqix, chiqpachansa.
There is no such thing.	Ukajj janiw utjkiti.
I don’t need to do that, really.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti, chiqpachansa.
Or another word.	Jan ukax yaqha aru.
He says he’s excited to go.	Jupax wali kusisitaw sarañ munta sasaw saraki.
But, he didn't do that.	Ukampis, uk janiw jupajj lurkänti.
No one knows exactly why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
He said he didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkti sasaw säna.

He’s been there a long time.	Jupax wali jaya pachaw ukan jikxatasi.

Of course, you know that.	Chiqpachansa, jumax uk yatisktawa.
He didn't know any better.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp sum yatkänti.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
He knows exactly what to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapa uk sum yati.
It’s either for some reason or not.	Ukax mä kunatsa jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't feel any different.	Jupajj janiw yaqha ukham amuyaskänti.
There has never been anything like this before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham kunas utjkänti.
And he is really bad.	Ukat chiqpachansa jan wali jaqiwa.
Nothing has happened yet.	Janiw kunas jichhakamax utjkiti.
He understood that.	Jupajj uk amuyäna.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
And he’s always been.	Ukat jupax sapa kutiw ukham jikxatasïna.
The price is well worth it.	Uka qullqix wali askiwa.
But in this case, it doesn’t have to be that way.	Ukampis aka tuqitxa, janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
What can you do now.	Jichhajj kunsa lurasma.
What is going on here? 	¿Kunas akan pasaski?
I really want to know why.	Chiqpachansa kunatsa uk yatiñ munta.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.

You knew why.	Jumax kunatsa uk yatiyäta.
I’m pretty excited about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Of course, that’s not the case.	Chiqpachansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have no idea why, really.	Kunatsa uk janiw amuykti, chiqpachansa.
I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurawayta.
There was nothing here.	Janiw kunas akan utjkänti.
Or he didn't want to.	Jan ukajj janiw munkänti.

But something happened.	Ukampis kunas pasäna.
He refused both.	Jupajj panpachaniw jan munkänti.
Why.	Kunatsa.
It also can’t be done.	Ukhamaraki janiwa lurañjamäkiti.
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
Gentle, but delicious.	Llamp’u, ukampis wali suma.

He had nothing to do here.	Jupax janiw kuna lurañas akan utjkänti.
I really want to do something about it.	Uka toqet kuns lurañ wal munta.
I don’t want to go anywhere.	Janiw kawkirus sarañ munkti.

That is what you want to do.	Ukaw jumajj lurañ munta.
He wanted to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa munäna.
We’re a big.	Jiwasax mä jach’a.
He didn't mean it that well.	Jupajj janiw ukham sum sañ munkänti.

Honestly, that’s really not the case.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Not you again.	Janiw jumajj mayampsa.

He’s the one who did things.	Jupaw kuns luräna.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkäti.
He really took care of it.	Chiqpachansa wali sum uñjäna.

It is immediately .	Ukajj jankʼakiw .
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
We weren’t the only ones.	Jiwasajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
There was nothing worse to do.	Janiw jukʼamp jan walinak lurañajj utjkänti.
He really didn't want to talk about it now.	Chiqpachansa janiw jichhax uka tuqit parlañ munkänti.
So I'm still very happy.	Ukhamajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
So it was now or never, he thought.	Ukhamajj jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I definitely don’t understand all that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw janiw taqi ukanak amuykti.
This is the best thing I’ve ever done.	Akax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He’s the wrong kind of person.	Jupax jan wali kasta jaqiwa.
But I don't know.	Ukampis janiw yatkti.
But he didn't say anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns siskänti.
It means nothing to me.	Nayatakejj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.

And that’s a good thing.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa.

Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukham sasaw amuyäna.
You don’t have to do it again.	Janiw mayamp lurañax wakiskiti.
Something felt very intense.	Kunas wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.

He has always been like that.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham sarnaqäna.

That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
There is nothing to say.	Janiw kunas sañjamäkiti.

But there is only one.	Ukampis mä sapakiw utji.

How will he do this? 	¿Kunjamsa jupajj uk lurani?
It is assumed that this will always be the case.	Ukax sapa kutiw utjani sasaw amuyasi.
He has nothing to do with it.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I don’t want to eat it, of course.	Nayax janiw manq’añ munkti, chiqpachansa.

There is nothing wrong with doing it.	Janiw kuna lurañas jan askïkiti.

That’s it, of course.	Ukax ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.

There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
But there was nothing there.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
Is it necessary to do something wrong?.	¿Jan walinak lurañajj wakisispati?.
A new day has arrived.	Mä machaq uruw purini.
He’s doing very well.	Jupax wali sum luraski.
He was doing a good job with her.	Jupampiw mä suma irnaqäw luraskäna.

He did it anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk luräna.

There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
I didn't know why very well.	Janiw kunatsa wal sum yatkayätti.

He didn't want to say anything .	Jupajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti .
He meant something, something, something.	Jupax kuns sañ munäna, kunas, kunas sañ munäna.
That’s what he did.	Ukhamaw jupajj luräna.
It was clear that he really wanted to go.	Chiqpachansa sarañ muni, ukax qhanaw amuyasïna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

Or it was something else.	Jan ukajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis lurañaw wakisi.
Another kind of.	Yaqha kasta.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.

He already knew it.	Jupajj niyaw yatïna.
We just can’t do that.	Jiwasax janiw ukax lurañjamäkiti.
It did just that.	Ukajj ukhamakiw luräna.
I really don’t remember.	Chiqpachansa janiw amtaskti.

It never happened to me.	Nayatakejj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.

This was not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.

There’s nothing like it anywhere else.	Janiw kawkhans ukham ukham utjkiti.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
Everything is good now.	Jichhax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I’m rather worried about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx juk’amp llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I don’t do that at all.	Nayax janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurkti.
He gave her a cup of coffee, which she wanted.	Jupajj mä café churäna, ukajj jupajj munäna.
He was the first to do it.	Jupaw nayraqat uk luräna.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Jupax alañ munta sasaw säna.

There was nothing else to do here.	Janiw kuna yaqha lurañas akan utjkänti.
It is readily available.	Ukajj jankʼakiw jikjjatasi.

But there was nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
But there isn't much time left.	Ukampis janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.

He was clearly enjoying the whole thing.	Jupajj taqe ukanak uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
That’s nothing .	Ukax janiw kunas .
But that is not the best way to do it.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wali askïkiti.
I never wanted him anyway.	Janipuniw kunjamatsa jupar munkayätti.
Anyway, that’s it.	Kawkhansa, ukax ukhamawa.

Maybe he bought a house.	Inas mä uta alasïna.

The boy didn’t understand.	Uka waynax janiw amuyaskänti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
He knew what he had to do here.	Jupajj kunsa akan lurañap yatïna.
It happened without love.	Ukajj jan munasiñampiw pasäna.
He wanted to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa munäna.

He wasn't sure why, but .	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkänti, ukampis .
That’s how it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax wakisi.
But he is not like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.

It has nothing to do with me now.	Jichhax janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti.

He didn't do it alone.	Jupajj janiw sapaki uk lurkänti.

He wasn't sure how he felt about it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uka toqet jikjjatasïna uk janiw sum yatkänti.

But everything though.	Ukampis taqi kunas ukampis.

He’s a bad guy.	Jupax jan wali jaqiwa.

And for two days there was nothing.	Ukat pä urux janiw kunas utjkänti.

He says he didn’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurkti sasaw saraki.
Or really nothing at all.	Jan ukax chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkaspati.
That’s not very good.	Ukax janiw sinti askïkiti.

She felt love for him when she saw him.	Jupar uñjasajj wali munasiñampiw jikjjatasïna.

He didn't want to do that to me.	Jupajj nayarojj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.

You can’t do it alone.	Janiw sapakix lurañjamäkiti.
But, no, she couldn’t tell him.	Ukampis, janiw, janiw jupar yatiyañ puedkänti.
It’s a human being.	Ukax mä jaqiwa.
That's what he said.	Ukhamaw jupajj säna.

He really wants to help.	Chiqpachansa yanaptʼañ muni.
No one else can do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañjamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.

Now he was feeling better.	Jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
So I don't want to do any more.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp lurañ munkti.

And he obviously decided to tell me.	Ukat qhanaw nayar yatiyañ amtäna.

I'm not sure why?.	Nayax kunatsa?.
Maybe it’s enough for you.	Inas jumatakix wakischispa.
So what is it! 	Ukhamajj ¡kunsa!
But he walked alone.	Ukampis mä sapakiw sarnaqäna.

But that’s exactly the point.	Ukampis ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.

He did it with great pleasure.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw uk luräna.

I just don't like him.	Nayajj janiw jupar gustkituti.
Or longer time.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp tiempo.
It’s going to be a slow motion.	Ukhamaw saraski.
I didn’t want to talk to him.	Janiw jupamp parlañ munkayätti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
Maybe it’s enough for me.	Inas nayatakix wakischispa.
Or what he wanted.	Jan ukajj kuntï munkäna uk.
He was like himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukhamänwa.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Always do it twice.	Sapa kutiw pä kuti lurañama.
But that is not unusual.	Ukampis ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
But in that respect.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa.
Well you know what happened.	Suma jumax yatisktawa kunas pasäna.
There’s something happening.	Ukanx kunas pasaski.
I don’t want to be alone.	Janiw nayax munkti.
But it’s really .	Ukampis chiqpachapuniw .
Honestly, there’s nothing you can do.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I think it’s pretty good.	Nayax wali sum amuyta.
Now this is interesting.	Jichhax akax wali askiwa.
You can do it yourself.	Jumax juma pachpaw lurasma.
He went to the john.	Jupajj uka john ukar saräna.
Not at all, he said.	Janiw kunjamatsa, sasaw säna.
That is how he felt now.	Ukhamaw jichhajj jikjjatasïna.
He meant to say that.	Jupajj uk sañ munäna.
So far, nothing has happened.	Jichhakamax janiw kunas utjkiti.

He loved her so much.	Jupajj jupar wal munäna.

I’ve never seen it all that much.	Janipuniw ukham taqpach uñjkti.
He doesn't like anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas gustkiti.
Not about that…	Janiw uka tuqitxa...
There can be no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkaspati.
There was no one about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit utjkänti.
Which he didn’t do.	Ukax jupax janiw lurkänti.

You just have to do that.	Jumax ukhamakiw ukham lurañama.
He doesn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ munkiti.
I think that is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw sasaw amuyta.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Jan ukax khitirus, uka tuqitxa.
I’m sure it doesn’t mean anything.	Nayax yatxatwa janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
But there was nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
Not so much, he thought.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, sasaw amuyäna.
He was still in a state of shock.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
Anything and anything.	Kunas ukat kunas.

It doesn't matter what you want anyway.	Janiw kunjamatsa kuntï munkta ukajj wakiskiti.
He was the first to do it.	Jupaw nayraqat uk luräna.
So it is obvious.	Ukhamajj qhanaw amuyasi.
Everything but coffee.	Taqi kunas jan ukax café.
Now or never.	Jichhax jan ukax janipuniw.
I’m in a hurry.	Nayax jank’akiw jikxatastxa.
It’s the best way to do this.	Uka lurañatakix wali askiwa.

There is nothing new to do.	Janiw kuna machaq lurañas utjkiti.
He didn't want money.	Jupajj janiw qollqe munkänti.
So what are you waiting for?.	Ukhamajj ¿kunsa suytʼaskta?.
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't do anything at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa kuns lurkänti.
There’s something for you.	Kunas jumatakix utji.

He hadn't done that for a long time.	Walja tiempow jan ukham lurkänti.

He didn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
I’m just so excited.	Nayax ukhamakiw wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
It wasn’t.	Ukhamänwa.
I know what happened that day.	Uka urux kunas pasäna uk yattwa.
No one wanted him.	Janiw khitis jupar munkänti.
But he knew it all too well.	Ukampis jupajj uk sum yatïna.
I understand that well.	Uk sum amuyasta.
It’s not impossible to do.	Janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He really needed some help.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa yanaptʼa munäna.
He is a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqewa.
But he never wanted to know about it.	Ukampis janipuniw uka toqet yatiñ munkänti.
I’m not saying that.	Janiw nayax ukham siskti.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I never plan to see it again.	Janipuniw mayamp uñjañ amtkti.
He wanted me for some reason.	Jupajj kunatsa nayar munäna.
So I'm still feeling sad.	Ukhamajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I really don’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkti.
There’s no money in it right now.	Jichhax janiw qullqix ukan utjkiti.

I have wanted to do this for a long time.	Walja tiempow ukham lurañ munta.
I never believed them.	Janipuniw jupanakar iyaw siskti.
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Janiw kunas ukax wakiskiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
So he didn't do it.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurkänti.
He thought he was doing better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum luraskta sasaw amuyäna.
I think this is better.	Nayax amuyta akax juk’amp askiwa.

I still enjoy doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
No one knows about it.	Janiw khitis yatkti.
So that's what he felt like.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj jikjjatasïna.
That is not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There’s nothing there.	Janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
That's what he said.	Ukhamaw jupajj säna.
I feel like a whole new person.	Mä machaq jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
So why was he doing this.	Ukhamajj kunatsa ukham luraskäna.
You know how to do it.	Jumax kunjamsa uk lurañ yatta.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham luratayna.
Something bigger needs to be done.	Kunas jukʼamp jachʼa lurañaw wakisi.
It wasn’t necessary.	Janiw wakiskänti.
That’s what happened.	Ukaw pasäna.
I did really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa lurawayta.

Money, of course.	Qullqi, chiqpachansa.
Everything is a good person.	Taqi kunas suma jaqiwa.

Everything is just as good or better.	Taqi kunas ukhamarakiw suma jan ukax juk’amp suma.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
So he was very successful.	Ukatwa wali sum sarnaqäna.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Inas, inas, inas.
And it’s not available in every country.	Ukat janiw sapa markan utjkiti.
Why, of course.	Kunatsa, chiqpachansa.
I really think he was.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.
It’s not impossible.	Janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
It’s been good for me so far.	Jichhakamax nayatakix wali askiwa.

Everything I didn’t know.	Taqi kunas janiw nayatakix yatkänti.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
It happened a long time ago, of course.	Ukax nayratpachaw pasäna, chiqpachansa.
He didn't know all that.	Jupajj taqe ukanak janiw yatkänti.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
I want to do something.	Nayax kuns lurañ munta.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
But really.	Ukampis chiqpachansa.
No way, really.	Janiw kunjamatsa, chiqpachansa.
But it’s not like that for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
And certainly not now.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti.
But do it quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw lurañama.
I'm not sure why? 	Nayax kunatsa?
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Now he knew better.	Jichhajj jupajj sum yatïna.

How do you guys do it? 	¿Kunjamsa jumajj lurasma?
He wanted it.	Jupajj uk munäna.
Now, he has both.	Jichhax, jupax panpachaniw utji.
He knows it very well.	Jupax wali sum yati.

He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
It doesn't matter what you want.	Janiw kuntï munkta ukajj wakiskiti.
I don’t want to do anything about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munkti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m not saying that.	Janiw nayax ukham siskti.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
But the day is long gone.	Ukampis uka urux wali jaya pachaw saraski.
So it's a good thing.	Ukhamajj wali askiwa.
He decided to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañwa amtäna.
He didn’t know how to drive at all.	Jupax janiw kunjamatsa auto apnaqañ yatkänti.
I almost never do that.	Niya janipuniw ukham lurkti.
It was as if he didn't quite know how.	Kunjamsa lurani uk janis sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
But he refused to do so.	Ukampis jupajj janiw munkänti.
He actually did that.	Chiqpachansa jupaw ukham luräna.

It’s not good for you in that country.	Uka markanx janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
He felt the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
I told him the truth.	Nayajj jupar cheq sista.

He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munäna.

There is no need to rush it.	Janiw jankʼak lurañajj wakiskiti.

He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
But he did it.	Ukampis jupajj uk luräna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is nothing to say.	Janiw kunas uk sañjamäkiti.
I don’t think anyone did.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti sasaw amuyta.
Everything happened quickly.	Taqi kunas jank’akiw pasäna.
And that definitely made it feel better.	Ukat ukajj cheqapuniw jukʼamp sum jikjjatasïna.

So he understood.	Ukatwa jupajj amuyasïna.
That’s why he really wanted this job.	Ukatwa jupax chiqpachapuni aka irnaqäw munäna.
Now again .	Jichhajj wasitatwa .
I want to see something done.	Nayax mä kun lurañ uñjañ munta.
That’s a bad guy.	Ukax jan wali jaqiwa.
It is important not to do so.	Jan ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
He planned it all himself .	Jupa pachpaw taqe ukanak amtäna .
Every day is something new.	Sapa uruw kuna machaq lurañas utji.

I want to talk to him.	Jupampiw parltʼañ munta.
One thing or another.	Mä kuna jan ukax yaqha.

He wanted to see her for himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupar uñjañ munäna.
He never did anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns lurkänti.
I would love to do that.	Ukham lurañajj walpun munta.
That happened a long time ago.	Ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.

He didn't want her.	Jupajj janiw jupar munkänti.

Maybe one day you’ll make something out of it.	Inas mä urux ukat kuns lurasma.

You can’t do that.	Jumax janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
He just told me he wanted to see it soon.	Jichhakiw jankʼak uñjañ munta sasaw sitäna.
It can never be repeated.	Janipuniw wasitat lurañjamäkiti.
So it went there.	Ukhamaw ukan saräna.
Nothing isn’t like that.	Janiw kunas jan ukhamäkiti.
I’m more concerned.	Nayax juk’amp llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I'm going to know.	Nayax yatiñ munta.

He seems to not be able to rush things.	Jupax kunjamtï jan kuns jankʼak lurañjamäkiti.
I already feel that way.	Nayax niyaw ukham amuyasta.
So it started there.	Ukhamaw ukan qalltäna.
There is only one .	Ukax mä sapakiw .
He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
That's not the way it works.	Ukham lurasajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He said he built a school.	Jupax mä yatiqañ uta lurawayta sasaw säna.
In fact, it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He’s done this before.	Jupax nayrax ukham luratayna.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
He got out of the car.	Jupajj autot sarjjäna.
He readily agreed.	Jupajj jankʼakiw iyaw säna.
Therefore the .	Ukatwa uka .
But really, both ways.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, panpachaniw ukham lurañapa.

He said he didn't know.	Jupajj janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
He knew better, now.	Jupax juk’amp sum yatïna, jichhax.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
In doing so, he is doing it to himself.	Ukham lurasajj jupa pachpaw uk luraski.
But there was no one.	Ukampis janiw khitis utjkänti.
So he moved to another place.	Ukatwa yaqha cheqar sarjjäna.

There wasn’t any of it.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkänti.
Almost, but not quite.	Niya, ukampis janiw taqpach.

Well then that happened.	Suma ukat ukax pasäna.
He went on his own anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa jupa pachpaw saräna.
Both of you are.	Panpachaniw jumanakax.
All day, all day.	Taqi uru, taqi uru.
Also, it’s better not to do it.	Ukhamaraki, jan lurañax juk’amp askiwa.
He never did anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns lurkänti.
He understood that perfectly.	Jupajj uk sum amuyäna.

He didn't know how to talk to her.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa jupamp parltʼañ yatkänti.

He had no idea how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañapa uk janiw amuykänti.
He is just doing it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw luraski.
We are also .	Jiwasax ukhamarakiw .

That’s not necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti.
But he knew it wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He wanted to do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa lurañ munäna.
He was more than happy.	Jupajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
There is no need to do so, which is good.	Ukham lurañajj janiw wakiskiti, ukajj wali askiwa.
Nothing about that.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
That happened a little bit.	Ukajj mä jukʼa pasäna.

But, that's worth it.	Ukampis, ukajj wali askiwa.

I didn't know any better than that.	Nayajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp yatkayätti.
I’m pretty excited about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
So he decided a while ago.	Ukatwa mä jukʼa tiempo nayrajj uk amtäna.

He refused, so he left.	Jupajj janiw munkänti, ukatwa sarjjäna.
So there is nothing.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas utjkiti.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But that is not possible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.

But that's not what it used to be.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunjamtï nayrajj utjkänti.

He was still in a state of shock.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
Or not at all.	Jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
No! 	Janiwa!
But no one could manage time.	Ukampis janiw khitis tiempo apnaqañ puedkänti.
That’s not the case, of course.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
I’m hoping that’s not the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw suyt’askta.
But it started early.	Ukampis nayratpachaw qalltäna.
I never said that.	Janipuniw ukham siskti.
So where does he live .	Ukhamajj kawkhansa jupajj jakasi .
It's a curious thing.	Ukajj yatiñ muni.
He can't have that.	Jupajj janiw ukham utjkaspati.
A little of this, a little of that.	Mä juk’a aka, mä juk’a ukat.

He loves it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munasi.
He feels uncomfortable.	Jupajj jan sum jikjjatasi.

I like this better.	Nayatakix akax juk’amp askiwa.
He saw this book here.	Jupax aka libro akan uñjäna.
It used to be, but it wasn't.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.

You’re a bad guy.	Jumax mä jan wali jaqiwa.

He understood this very well.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa amuyasïna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
It needs to be done better than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum lurañaw wakisi.
He doesn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkiti.
He said he was too sorry.	Jupajj sinti llakistwa sasaw säna.
That’s exactly what happens in this country.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw aka markanx utji.

But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
It’s not like that at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
So many times it is not.	Ukhamajj walja kutiw jan ukhamäkiti.
He told them to.	Jupaw jupanakar säna.
He will love me very much.	Jupajj nayarojj wal munasini.
But something needs to be done.	Ukampis kun lurañaw wakisi.
You can’t do it there.	Janiw ukan lurañjamäkiti.
But no one wants to see it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk uñjañ munkiti.

He knows exactly where everything is.	Jupajj kawkhansa taqe kunas utji uk sum yati.
He’s the one who’s done it all.	Jupaw taqe ukanak lurawayi.
And that’s really good.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
Fortunately, it doesn’t.	Wali askiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s where he went.	Ukaw jupajj saräna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Twice, or maybe three times.	Pä kuti, jan ukax inas kimsa kuti.

He told me exactly what he wanted to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkäna uk sumwa sitäna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I didn’t know where to go.	Janiw kawkirus sarañ yatkayätti.
But why would you do that?.	Ukampis ¿kunatsa ukham lurasma?.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Not a nice word.	Janiw mä suma aru.
We don’t, of course.	Jiwasax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
He did both well.	Jupajj panpachaniw sum luräna.
I think we need to do two things.	Pä lurañaw wakisi sasaw amuyta.

That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.

That’s how it feels to me.	Ukhamaw nayatakix amuyasi.
I knew about it well.	Uka toqet sum yatiyäta.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Is it worth it for you?.	Jumatakix wali askiwa?.
He knew almost exactly how she felt.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasïna uk niyaw sum yatïna.
For me, he is .	Nayatakejj jupajj .
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think this is interesting.	Nayax amuyta akax wali askiwa.
That happened the day before.	Ukajj nayrïr uruw pasäna.
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
There was no time limit.	Janiw kuna tiempos utjkänti.
Yesterday it wasn't.	Qharürojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He now decided what to do.	Jupajj jichhajj kun lurañsa amtäna.

It means talking.	Ukax parlañ sañ muni.
He didn't care why.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw kuns lurkänti.

I'm not sure what to do.	Nayajj janiw sasaw sista.

Everything is not necessary.	Taqi kunas janiw wakiskiti.
So that didn't last long.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw jaya tiempojj utjkänti.
No, he said he didn’t want to eat.	Janiwa, janiwa manq’añ munkiti sasaw säna.
They’re still worth it.	Jupanakax wali askiwa.

There was nothing there, not yet.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkänti, janiw jichhakamax utjkänti.
It wasn’t in the house.	Janiw uka utan utjkänti.
I want that to happen.	Nayax uk munta.
I think you understand that.	Nayax amuyta, jumax uk amuyta.
You have no way of doing this .	Jumax janiw kunjamatsa aka .
There is no need to do so.	Ukham lurañajj janiw wakiskiti.
He wants to see you very much.	Jupajj jumar wal uñjañ muni.
I don’t agree with that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx iyaw siskti.
But, that doesn’t mean much.	Ukampis, ukax janiw sinti sañ munkiti.
That was a big maybe.	Ukax mä jach’a inas ukhamänwa.
I never told him.	Janipuniw jupar siskti.
He never did a thing for me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayatak mä jukʼa lurkänti.
This was not the case before.	Ukajj janiw nayrajj utjkänti.
You can’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurañax utjkaspati.
He felt better immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sum jikjjatasïna.
He’s not good enough right now.	Jupax janiw jichhax askïkiti.
I like it when a man does that.	Mä chachan ukham lurañajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
Beautiful sum sum.	Suma suma suma.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
It had never been like this before.	Nayrajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to go home.	Nayax utar sarañ munta.
But there was nothing more to do.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkänti.
No one knows for sure.	Janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
He did everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe kun luräna.
But that’s not really the case.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
But something will happen.	Ukampis kunas pasani.
This does not mean that it is the same person.	Ukajj janiw uka pachpa jaqëkaspas ukham sañ munkiti.
I think he’s a good guy.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He told me what I wanted to do.	Jupaw kun lurañsa munta uk sitäna.
He was nobody.	Jupajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
He never did anything like that to me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayarojj ukham kuns lurkänti.
That never happened.	Ukax janipuniw utjkänti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
I don’t think we need to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti sasaw amuyta.
I don't want to see it anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp uñjañ munkti.
He thought he was about to arrive.	Jupajj niyaw purini sasaw amuyäna.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
A huge amount of money.	Mä jachʼa qollqe.
I actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurawayta.
But there was no time.	Ukampis janiw tiempojj utjkänti.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Jupajj janiw kunsa uka toqet lurañap yatkänti.
He didn't want to see me.	Jupajj janiw nayar uñjañ munkänti.
I know it's pretty good.	Nayajj wali suma yattwa.
There’s nothing like that.	Janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
That’s really what it’s all about.	Ukaw chiqpachapuni uka tuqitxa.
But obviously not.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
But it never happened to me.	Ukampis janipuniw nayatakejj ukhamäkänti.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that was not the case today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
He seems to be a different kind of person.	Jupajj yaqha kasta jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
I really want to see that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uk uñjañ munta.
I want to go to school.	Nayax yatiqañ utar sarañ munta.
I will definitely be doing this again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wasitat aka lurañax utjani.
He never needs to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I know you understand.	Nayax yattwa jumax amuyasta.
So you know what you're doing.	Ukhamajj jumajj yatisktawa.
This guy did that.	Aka waynax ukham luratayna.
I’m the only one who doesn’t have it.	Naya sapakiw jan ukax utjkituti.
It is both and .	Ukax panpachaniw ukat .
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
And that word.	Ukat uka aru.
You have to do everything you can about it.	Uka tuqitxa taqi kunsa lurañaw wakisi.
He went home early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwat utar sarjjäna.
All well and good.	Taqi kunas wali suma ukat suma.
I see a lot here.	Nayax akan walja uñjta.
He doesn’t know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk yatkiti.
Today was a little sad.	Jichhürojj mä jukʼa llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He wanted to go big or go home.	Jupax jach’a sarañ jan ukax utar sarañ munäna.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham uñjkti.
There will be something for you.	Kunas jumatakix utjani.
I’ve seen both.	Nayax panpachaniw uñjta.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayatakix ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
How he behaved.	Kunjamsa jupax sarnaqäna.
He didn't do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkänti.
I don’t want to see it.	Janiw nayax uñjañ munkti.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw uk lurañ munkti.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
He’s the one who knows it.	Jupaw uk yattwa.
I want to do it.	Nayax lurañ munta.
That seems pretty obvious to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali qhanaw amuyasi.
I hope it does well.	Nayax wali sum lurañapatakiw suyt’askta.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But there is no one here.	Ukampis janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
He was just so great already.	Jupax ukhamakiw wali jach’a niyaw jikxatasïna.
And he’s alone.	Ukat jupax sapakiw jikxatasi.
He knows better than that.	Jupaw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum yati.
So it’s not completely impossible.	Ukhamajj janiw taqpach jan lurañjamäkiti.
He never noticed.	Jupajj janipuniw amuyaskänti.
There’s always something.	Ukax sapa kutiw kunas utji.
A single word.	Mä sapa aru.
He didn't do everything right.	Jupajj janiw taqe kunsa sum lurkänti.
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Janiw kunas ukax wakiskiti.
But alone it is not.	Ukampis sapakix janiw ukhamäkiti.
There’s no money in it.	Ukanx janiw qullqix utjkiti.
And it wasn’t like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkänti.
I want to know where I’m going, really.	Nayax kawkirus sarañax uk yatiñ munta, chiqpachapuniw.
There was no time.	Tiempojj janiw utjkänti.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
But now he was alone.	Ukampis jichhajj jupajj sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
There was nothing to do, really.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
I think he knew that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uk yatïna.
But he doesn't want to talk any more.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp parlañ munkiti.
That’s a little bit to say.	Ukax mä juk’a sañ muni.
That happened today.	Ukajj jichhüruw pasäna.

About the .	Uka tuqitxa .
But he didn't say that.	Ukampis janiw uk siskänti.

No, not at all.	Janiwa, janiw kunjamatsa.

Or maybe .	Jan ukajj inas .
Something wanted to go wrong.	Kunas jan walinak lurañ munäna.
He didn't know exactly.	Jupajj janiw sum yatkänti.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham uñjkti.
He was too excited.	Jupajj sinti kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He doesn’t know it yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax uk yatkiti.
It was never the case.	Janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
You don’t need to do any more.	Janiw juk’amp lurañax wakiskiti.
It was the only thing he could do.	Uka sapakiw lurañ yatïna.
I don’t know, myself.	Nayax janiw yatkti, naya pachpa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
I can’t do anything about it.	Janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
I don't see him any more.	Nayajj janiw jupar jukʼamp uñjkti.
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
I really hope he does.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw suyt’askta jupax ukham lurani.
He was devastated and depressed.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna ukat llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I don't know any more.	Janiw juk'amp yatkti.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.
He is doing much better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luraski.

You don’t need to.	Jumax janiw wakiskiti.
But fortunately, it doesn’t.	Ukampis wali askiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.

He has no one else.	Jupajj janiw khitis utjkiti.
I understand this myself.	Naya pachpaw uk sum amuyasta.
I think it’s worth it.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali askiwa.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I’m doing the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw luraskta.
So you don't need that time.	Ukhamajj janiw uka tiempojj wakiskiti.
But he didn’t want that, of course.	Ukampis janiw uk munkänti, chiqpachansa.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
No one wants to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañ munkiti.
I completely understand.	Nayax taqpach amuyta.
But that wasn't necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He wants nothing more to do with you.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp jumamp lurañ munkiti.

It’s better there.	Ukanx juk’amp askiwa.
But it’s not, of course.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Another kind of language.	Yaqha kasta aru.
I don’t know exactly where.	Janiw kawkhans uk sum yatkti.
I know that now.	Jichhajj uk yattwa.
But he refused to do so.	Ukampis jupajj janiw munkänti.

You can’t have them.	Janiw jupanakar utjkaspati.
That’s exactly what happened.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.
He wanted no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp munkänti.

That's what he knew.	Ukaw jupajj yatïna.

So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
So I'm still very happy.	Ukhamajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
In fact, it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
Nothing major needed.	Janiw kuna jachʼa lurañas wakiskiti.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
So there was nothing else to do.	Ukatwa janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
There is something you can do.	Kuna lurañas wakisispa.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He was a little lonely.	Jupax mä juk’a sapakiw jikxatasïna.
He was very happy here.	Jupajj akan wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.

But there's nothing better about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqit jukʼamp sum lurañax utjkiti.
Also, the character.	Ukhamaraki.
But that is not a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wali askïkiti.

There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
We’ve had a lot of trouble.	Jiwasax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.

Everything is good for you.	Taqi kunas jumatakix wali askiwa.
This happened many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasäna.
He found out today.	Jupax jichhüruw jikxatasïna.
In fact, it was.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.
That means both.	Ukajj panpachaniw sañ muni.

It is not necessary anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp wakiskiti.
In both cases.	Uka pä tuqitxa.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

Good or bad.	Suma jan ukax jan wali.
I think the bigger the better.	Nayax amuyta juk’amp jach’a ukax juk’amp askiwa.

The reason was not immediately apparent.	Kunatsa ukham luräna ukajj janiw jankʼak amuyaskänti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
That means money.	Ukax qullqi sañ muni.
I feel sad about that.	Uka tuqitxa llakitaw jikxatastxa.
And this is what he did.	Ukat aka lurawayi.
No, it was different.	Janiwa, yaqha ukhamänwa.

But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He’ll have something for you.	Jupax jumatakix kunas utjani.
I’m sure he doesn’t mean it.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax janiw uk sañ munkiti.

And he never quite knew how.	Ukat kunjamsa uk janipuniw sum yatkänti.
It’s still worth it now.	Jichhax wali askiwa.

And maybe again.	Ukat inas wasitat ukham jikjjatasta.
No one knows anything about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet kuns yatkiti.
So that's not the case.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But for some reason, it’s not.	Ukampis kunatsa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
That he wasn't, ever.	Ukajj janiw jupajj utjkänti, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
It was a very enjoyable day.	Uka urux wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.

Or so she said.	Jan ukajj ukham sasaw jupajj säna.

I did nothing, really nothing, for a long time.	Janiw kuns lurkti, chiqpachansa janiw kuns lurkti, walja tiempow lurawayta.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
He wanted to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañ munäna.

That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is nothing else to do.	Janiw kuna yaqha lurañas utjkiti.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.

It’s always costly.	Ukax sapa kutiw qullqix utji.
But, this isn’t your case.	Ukampis, janiw akax jumanakan ukhamäkiti.
He saw her as a villain.	Jupajj mä jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamwa uñjäna.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.

He started again.	Jupajj wasitatwa qalltäna.
That is what we need to do today.	Jichhürunakanxa ukham lurañaw wakisi.
They weren't like that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And so things happened.	Ukat ukhamaw kunas pasäna.

This is absolutely impossible.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He feels the same way about me.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw nayat amuyasi.

He knows what it is.	Jupajj kunas ukajj uk sum yati.

It can’t be without it.	Janiw jan utjkaspati.
He wasn't quite sure.	Jupajj janiw sum amuyaskänti.
He never wanted anything.	Janipuniw kunas munkänti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
You know the word.	Jumax uka aru yatisktawa.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know exactly what he told me.	Kuntï jupajj sitäna uk sum yatta.
But he did just that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamwa luräna.
That’s why it really matters.	Ukatwa chiqpachapuni ukax wakisi.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He didn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
He felt a little better.	Jupajj mä jukʼa sumwa jikjjatasïna.
Of course, that’s not the case.	Chiqpachansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
And you should do the same.	Ukat jumajj ukhamarakiw lurañama.
I don't plan on buying this again.	Janiw aka mayamp alañ amtkti.
He politely refused.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw jan munkänti.

There’s nothing there.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkiti.

I never did anything to him.	Janipuniw jupar kuns lurkti.

He didn't want me.	Jupajj janiw nayar munkänti.
I didn't want him.	Nayajj janiw jupar munkayätti.

He is still in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasi.
He didn't say that.	Jupajj janiw ukham siskänti.
He just did it right away.	Jupajj ukhamakiw uk luräna.

It’s going to be a long time.	Ukax jaya pachaw utjani.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
It doesn’t mean anything to you.	Janiw jumatakix kuns sañ munkiti.
You know you never had to.	Janipuniw ukham lurañax wakiskänti, uk jumax yatisktawa.

He went that way.	Jupajj ukham saräna.

But he didn't say no.	Ukampis janiw janiw siskänti.

He obviously didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

It actually happened.	Chiqpachansa ukax pasäna.

But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.

He wanted to talk to her.	Jupampiw parltʼañ munäna.

There is never a need to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.

I know about it well enough.	Uka toqet sumwa yatta.
No.	Janiwa.
I had done enough, he thought.	Nayajj walpun lurawayta, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I didn’t do anything.	Nayax janiw kuns lurkti.
Or it just went away.	Jan ukajj ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sum yatïna.
I think he seemed like a good guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
I’m pretty excited about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Still nothing to do.	Wali janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
Not very good, really.	Janiw wali askïkiti, chiqpachansa.
No, there was nothing to do.	Janiwa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
Everything lasts a year.	Taqi kunas mä maraw utji.
He’s feeling sad.	Jupax llakitaw jikxatasi.
He wanted to do it better.	Uk jukʼamp sum lurañ munäna.
Not that again.	Janiw ukax mayampsa.
What? 	Kuna?
Great that I like.	Jach’a ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas jumatakix utjkiti.
I said it was the first time.	Nayax nayrïr kutiw sasaw sista.
He never said anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns siskänti.
And it was nothing major.	Ukat janiw kuna jachʼa lurañas utjkänti.
Gentle and uncomfortable, somehow.	Llamp’u ukat jan wali, kunjamatsa.
Another good word that.	Yaqha suma aru uka.
It’s good for you in that regard.	Uka tuqitxa jumatakix wali askiwa.
But one night with him isn’t enough.	Ukampis jupamp mä arumax janiw wakiskiti.
It’s always there.	Ukax sapa kutiw utji.
That didn't mean that.	Ukajj janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
He certainly did.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukham luräna.
They were very nice.	Wali askiwa.
It’s not the most economically viable option.	Janiw qullqi tuqitx juk’amp askïkiti.
That started it all.	Ukaw taqe ukanak qalltäna.
And a great one that.	Ukat mä jach’a mä uka.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
You're the one who knows.	Jumax yatisktawa.
He had already done something.	Jupajj nayratpachaw kuns luratayna.
Something like that actually happened.	Chiqpachansa, ukham kunas pasäna.
And he wanted her again.	Ukat wasitatwa jupar munäna.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Janiw ukax askïkiti.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
So he 's .	Ukhamajj jupajj .
He was always like that.	Jupajj sapa kutiw ukham sarnaqäna.
He didn't tell anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitirus siskänti.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He knew what we were doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk jupajj sum yatïna.
But I wanted nothing more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkayätti.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
It happened so fast.	Ukham jankʼakiw pasäna.
Now, it just isn’t.	Jichhax, ukhamakiw jan ukhamäkiti.
He knows nothing else.	Jupajj janiw yaqha ukham yatkiti.
I don’t know that for sure.	Nayax janiw uk sum yatkti.
I don’t think we need to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti sasaw amuyta.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
I don't believe that at all.	Nayajj janiw uk kuns creykti.
I just feel like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw jikxatastxa.
He knew he knew it.	Jupajj uk yatïna uk sum yatïna.
He loves me so much.	Jupajj nayamp walpun munasi.
But I don't have any time.	Ukampis janiw kuna tiempos utjkituti.
Do this several times.	Walja kutiw ukham lurañama.
You can do this yourself at home.	Utan juma pachpaw uk lurasma.
I thought you knew that.	Nayajj jumajj uk yatisktawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Now we now that.	Jichhax jiwasax jichhax uka.
He’s very, very depressed right now.	Jupax jichhax wali, wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
I don’t believe it.	Nayax janiw iyaw siskti.
He had a good time with her.	Jupampiw wali sum sarnaqäna.
He doesn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykiti.
This is impossible .	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti .
The only one, really.	Uka sapakiw, chiqpachansa.
I actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurawayta.
He wants to talk about me.	Jupajj nayat parlañ muni.
It’s done it for a long time.	Walja pachaw lurawayi.
I understood that perfectly.	Uk sum amuyayäta.
He saw why.	Jupax kunatsa uk uñjäna.
No one seems to believe me.	Janiw khitis nayar iyaw sañjamäkiti.
But somehow it wasn’t.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw ukhamäkänti.
I find them all the time.	Jupanakajj sapa kutiw jikjjatasta.
He didn't want to see anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns uñjañ munkänti.
That’s what it is now.	Ukax jichhax ukhamawa.
I was not sure at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa sum yatkayätti.
In one or two ways.	Mä jan ukax pä tuqitxa.
I realized this for a long time.	Uka tuqitxa wali jaya tiempow amuyasta.
He said that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
It’s a great guy.	Jach’a jaqiwa.
He doesn’t want to go there.	Janiw ukar sarañ munkiti.
That is what you have to do.	Ukaw jumajj lurañama.
But he could do nothing about it.	Ukampis uka toqet janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
You can’t not do that.	Janiw jan ukham lurañax utjkaspati.
That just happened.	Ukajj jichhakiw pasäna.
He was more than happy.	Jupajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He refuses everything.	Jupax taqi kuns janiw sañ munkiti.
But I mean that.	Ukampis nayajj uk sañ munta.
And nobody wants to say that.	Ukat janiw khitis ukham sañ munkiti.
I want to tell him.	Nayax jupar yatiyañ munta.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
She didn't want to do what he said.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukham lurañ munkänti.
But it is not possible to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.
Anywhere, of course.	Kawkhansa, chiqpachansa.
I didn’t want to do anything about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munkayätti.
So he started driving.	Ukatwa auto apnaqañ qalltäna.
More needs to be done.	Jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
That’s exactly what it is.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa.
That’s what you need to do.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi.
It’s not what he did.	Janiw kuntï lurkäna ukhamäkiti.
I’m just waiting for something to happen.	Nayax kunas pasani sasaw suyt’askta.
He said he wanted to do something.	Jupax kuns lurañ munta sasaw säna.
But you know what it is.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa kunas uk.
There’s nowhere else to go.	Janiw yaqha chiqar sarañax utjkiti.
Or two things.	Jan ukax pä kunas.
But now he didn't care.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
But he thought it would happen soon.	Ukampis niyaw ukham pasani sasaw amuyäna.
I don't know what it is.	Kunas ukajj uk janiw yatkti.
And of course he was.	Ukat chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
And it’s not impossible.	Ukat janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
But you are not like that.	Ukampis janiw jumajj ukhamäkiti.
How does he know all this.	Kunjamatsa jupax taqi ukanak yati.
He has that for sure.	Jupajj ukajj cheqapuniw utji.
He was doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraskäna.
I said it was worth it.	Nayax wali askiwa sasaw sista.
I know how you feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk nayajj yattwa.
No one wanted it alone before.	Janiw khitis nayrajj sapak munkänti.
Everything about this night is good for me.	Taqi kunas aka arumax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It works for me right now.	Jichhax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He doesn't understand.	Jupajj janiw amuykiti.
So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
He didn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.
He had no idea how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañapa uk janiw amuykänti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m happy about that.	Nayax uka tuqit kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
I have no idea how he does it.	Kunjamsa uk luraski uk janiw amuykti.
That wasn’t the case now.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’ve never seen it all that much.	Janipuniw ukham taqpach uñjkti.
Now I see it all.	Jichhax taqi ukanak uñjta.
And he began to speak.	Ukat parlañ qalltäna.
But there was no sister.	Ukampis janiw kullakajj utjkänti.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
Everything happened quickly.	Taqi kunas jankʼakiw pasäna.
They are a .	Jupanakajj mä .
He knew a lot about it.	Jupajj walpun yatïna.
And alone .	Ukat sapakiw .
He said so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham säna.
To be honest, he didn’t really want to know.	Chiqpachansa, janiw chiqpachapuni yatiñ munkänti.
I know how he feels about it.	Uka toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
Nothing to do yet.	Janiw kunas jichhakamax lurañax utjkiti.
And he knew it well.	Ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
But it’s almost always helpless.	Ukampis niya sapa kutiw jan kun lurañjamäkiti.
But he wanted it that way.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamwa munäna.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
It's the.	Ukax uka...
He knew what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He knew what he was doing.	Kuntï lurkäna uk sum yatïna.

Very nice, too.	Wali suma, ukhamaraki.

One, one of a kind.	Mä, mä kasta.

He felt that way.	Jupajj ukhamwa amuyasïna.
It was the first time he wanted to talk about it.	Nayrïr kutiw uka tuqit parltʼañ munäna.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He wanted her to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañapatakiw munäna.
But it was good for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali askiwa.
I understood that.	Nayajj uk amuyayäta.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
This has not always been the case.	Ukajj janiw nayratpach ukhamäkänti.

It doesn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
So now what is it? 	Ukhamajj jichhajj ¿kunsa?
he thought to himself.	sasaw amuyäna.
He didn't want to say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
He walked around a little bit.	Mä juk’a sarnaqäna.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
This was a moment of great joy.	Ukajj mä jukʼa tiempojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
That’s exactly what it felt like.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
It’s all good though.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa ukampis.
But it worked for me.	Ukampis nayatakix wali askiwa.
He was alone in the house.	Jupax sapakiw uka utan jikxatasïna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I think you know what it is.	Nayax amuyta, jumax yatisktawa kunas ukax.
He still said he hadn't seen it.	Jupajj janiw uñjkti sasaw wali säna.
That’s all good stuff.	Ukax taqi kunas wali askiwa.

But that is not the case today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
And now.	Ukat jichhax.
Night or day.	Arumax jan ukax uru.

He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
There wasn’t.	Janiw utjkänti.

The next day he started regularly.	Qhipürux jupax sapa kutiw qalltäna.
Don't be afraid.	Janiwa janiwa.
Great day, tomorrow.	Jach’a uru, qharüru.
He did as he pleased.	Jupajj kunjamtï munkäna ukhamwa luräna.
He didn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykänti.
You can’t do everything.	Janiw taqi kun lurañjamäkiti.
Always, always, always!.	Sapa kuti, sapa kuti, sapa kuti!.
What do you want from me?.	¿Kunsa nayat munta?.
You know, not really.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.

He didn't want to go to a house.	Jupajj janiw mä utar sarañ munkänti.

There seemed to be no other option.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkaspati sasaw amuyasïna.
He didn't want it here.	Jupajj janiw akan munkänti.
He didn’t want to know about the car, of course.	Jupax janiw uka autot yatiñ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
I didn’t do that at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurkti.
He didn't think so at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham amuykänti.
That’s good, whatever.	Ukax wali askiwa, kunas.
He knew about it now.	Jupajj jichhajj uka toqet sum yatïna.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.

Very fast, actually.	Wali jaya, chiqpachansa.
It is much better to do so.	Ukham lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa.
And he bought another one.	Ukat yaqha alasïna.
Or maybe it’s .	Jan ukajj inas ukajj .
He’s a really nice guy.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw wali suma jaqiwa.
You know, he does it every year.	Jumax yatisktawa, jupax sapa maraw uk luraski.

There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He said it would happen soon.	Ukajj niyaw pasani sasaw säna.

Like he wasn't himself.	Kunjamtï jupajj jan jupa pachpa ukhamäkänti.
There was no need to do that.	Ukham lurañajj janiw wakiskänti.
So he understood that.	Ukhamajj uk jupajj amuyasïna.

He decides everything.	Jupaw taqe kunsa amti.
This is rarely the case.	Ukajj janiw sinti utjkiti.

That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don't want to do anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurañ munkti.

This is impossible to do.	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
No one wanted him.	Janiw khitis jupar munkänti.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
I don't want much.	Janiw walpun munkti.
He wanted it to be so.	Jupajj ukhamwa munäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
His feelings were not what he wanted.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna ukajj janiw kunjamtï munkäna ukhamäkänti.
That’s how it went.	Ukhamaw sarnaqäna.
You know everything.	Jumax taqi kun yatisktawa.

Maybe there is nothing.	Inas jan kunas utjkaspati.
It’s really just that.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamakiw.
That’s even better.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa.
But that was rare.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti utjkänti.
But it hasn’t always been that way.	Ukampis janiw nayratpach ukhamäkänti.
To be honest, he didn't want one.	Chiqpachansa, janiw mä jukʼa munkänti.
I don't intend to do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham amtkti.
I didn't want that.	Nayajj janiw uk munkayätti.
But there’s nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kunas lurañax utjkiti.
It’s not available anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans utjkiti.
Better than you, a lot.	Jumat sipansa juk’amp askiwa, walja.

Well now this.	Suma jichhax aka.

He was very happy about it.	Jupax uka tuqit wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
But what he does on a regular basis is quite the opposite.	Ukampis kuntï sapa kuti luraski ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Kind of big, actually.	Mä juk’a jach’a, chiqpachansa.
I’ve never done that.	Nayax janipuniw ukham lurkti.

He saw it in the sky.	Jupajj uk uñjäna.
It was clear what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He began to react immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw kuns lurañ qalltäna.

You don’t have to redo one every time.	Janiw sapa kuti mä wasitat lurañax wakiskiti.

He didn't want to talk to me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp parlañ munkänti.
No one knew about it.	Janiw khitis uk yatkänti.
But it really kind of is.	Ukampis chiqpachansa mä kasta ukhamawa.
It didn't do anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
There’s really nothing you can do about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
So he didn't want me.	Ukhamajj janiw nayar munkänti.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Janiw khitis jupamp parlañ munkänti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He didn't even have to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañas wakiskänti.
Or nothing at all.	Jan ukajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
This was it, he thought.	Akax ukhamänwa, sasaw amuyäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
It will be a great day.	Uka urux wali jachʼa uruw utjani.
He was the one who started it.	Jupaw qalltäna.
Or a nobody.	Jan ukax mä jan khitis.
Well far away but far better.	Suma jaya jaya ukampis jaya suma.
And the whole next day, nothing.	Ukat taqpach qhipürux, janiw kunas utjkänti.
I’m sorry about that.	Nayax uka tuqit llakistwa.
I'm going to love it.	Nayax walpun munta.
That didn't do it for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj lurkänti.
It was exactly what he was supposed to do.	Ukajj kunjamtï jupajj lurañapäkäna ukhamänwa.
All day, every day.	Taqi uru, sapa uru.
That’s what did the wrong thing.	Ukaw jan walinak luräna.

But you are still in pain.	Ukampis jumajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.

He knew exactly where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk sum yatïna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
Maybe it’s worth doing.	Inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
That’s even better.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa.
He couldn’t stay still.	Jupax janiw wali qhiparañ puedkänti.
But no one knows what to do.	Ukampis kuna lurañas wakisispa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
So much the better.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa.
He bought himself some time.	Jupa pachpaw mä qhawqha tiempo alasïna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And another one.	Ukat yaqha.
Or it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
Anything, not everything.	Kunas, janiw taqpach.

I know you know how to do this.	Nayax yattwa jumax kunjams uk lurañ yatta.
I do and you know that.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jumajj ukham yatta.
He started it all .	Jupaw taqe ukanak qalltäna .
That was not what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw jupajj munkänti.
Whatever that means.	Kunjamsa ukajj sañ muni.
That’s a good thing for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That was the case.	Ukajj ukhamänwa.
He wasn’t sure who did that.	Jupax janiw khitis ukham luratapat sum yatkänti.
Do you know how to use it? 	¿Uka apnaqañ yatta?
I don’t know why he said that.	Kunatsa ukham säna uk janiw yatkti.
And no it isn’t.	Ukat janiw janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
But it wasn’t always the case.	Ukampis sapa kutiw janiw ukhamäkänti.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas utjkaspati.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s a character.	Jupax mä jaqiwa.
He did a lot of bad things.	Walja jan walinak lurawayi.
I couldn't understand how I felt when I saw him.	Jupar uñjasajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk janiw amuykayätti.
I'm doing my best.	Nayax taqi ch'amampiw luraskta.
But now it was.	Ukampis jichhajj ukhamänwa.
It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He feels alone.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasi.
He doesn’t exist.	Jupax janiw utjkiti.
Another beautiful day.	Yaqha suma uru.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Now it was like that.	Jichhajj ukhamänwa.
I don't have anything.	Nayajj janiw kunas utjkituti.
I don’t want to talk.	Nayax janiw parlañ munkti.
That’s just how it is.	Ukax ukhamakiw utji.
And beyond that .	Ukat ukat sipansa .

That’s a big one.	Ukax mä jach’a.
Or anything really.	Jan ukax kuna lurañas chiqpachapuni.
There is nothing here.	Janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
And for that matter .	Ukat uka tuqitxa .
He understood all of this.	Jupajj taqe ukanak sum amuyäna.
But that was the case in the past.	Ukampis nayrajj ukhamänwa.
He never knew what had happened.	Jupajj janipuniw kunas paskäna uk yatkänti.
He actually said that.	Chiqpachansa ukham säna.
It was a long time ago.	Ukajj wali jaya tiempow pasäna.

And it’s a great one, too.	Ukat mä jach’a jaqiwa, ukhamaraki.
You know that.'	Jumax uk yatisktawa’ sasaw säna.
This is not what anyone wanted.	Ukajj janiw khitis munkäna ukhamäkiti.
He didn't do anything wrong.	Jupajj janiw jan walinak lurkänti.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luratayna.
It really wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want it any other way.	Jupajj janiw yaqha tuqitxa munkänti.
But it hasn’t always been that way.	Ukampis janiw nayratpach ukhamäkänti.
He knew he had to do some kind of thing.	Jupajj mä kasta lurañaw wakisi uk sum yatïna.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
So it takes longer.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp tiempow munasi.
It happened to me personally.	Naya pachpaw ukham pasäna.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Now now .	Jichhax jichhax .
You know, whatever.	Jumax yatisktawa, kunas.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He says it’s not like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw saraki.
He wasn't there.	Jupajj janiw utjkänti.
I have a little bit of time.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw utjitu.
No one knows anything.	Janiw khitis kuns yatkiti.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Why, of course it is.	Kunatsa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
How do you feel about it.	Kunjamsa jumajj amuyta.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
The same is true.	Ukhamarakiw jikxatasi.
You don't have to.	Janiw jumanakajj wakiskiti.
He couldn't say that .	Jupajj janiw ukham sañ puedkänti .
He didn't need to.	Jupajj janiw wakiskänti.
New school, new school, bad school.	Machaq yatiqañ uta, machaq yatiqañ uta, jan wali yatiqañ uta.
I say that without malice.	Nayax jan jan wali amuyumpiw ukham sista.
I don't believe it.	Nayajj janiw creykti.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing.	Kuntï luraski uk janiw yatkiti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He did both things.	Jupajj panpachaniw kuns luräna.
It didn’t do it all alone.	Ukax janiw sapakix taqi ukanak lurkänti.
And they .	Ukat jupanakax .
He’s a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
But they treated them well.	Ukampis jupanakajj wali sumwa jupanakar uñjäna.
I'm going to go.	Nayax sarañ munta.
But none of that, really.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

I really don’t like that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañax wali askïkiti.
It’s definitely there.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw utji.
He never had anyone.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus utjkänti.
He understood the urgency.	Jupajj jankʼak lurañwa amuyasïna.
There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He didn't know all of that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa yatkänti.
But there was nothing else to do.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
But no one knows for sure.	Ukampis janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
There was no one now.	Jichhajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He is a stupid guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqewa.

And that’s what it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamawa.

And this, and that, and this.	Ukat aka, ukat uka, ukat aka.
He did this three times.	Kimsa kutiw ukham luräna.
He’s a great guy.	Jupax jach’a jaqiwa.
That’s not necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti.
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayatakix ukax wali askiwa.
he says, 'It's not.	sasaw saraki.
That meant too soon.	Ukajj wali jankʼakiw sañ munäna.
He felt that way about it himself.	Uka tuqitxa jupa pachpaw ukham amuyäna.
I didn’t know that.	Janiw uk yatkayätti.
And nobody likes it.	Ukat janiw khitis ukanak gustkiti.
Another great great car.	Yaqha jach’a jach’a auto.
Either that, or he wanted to know.	Jan ukax ukax, jan ukax jupax yatiñ munäna.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
I have no choice now.	Jichhajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti.
He did a lot of it.	Jupax walpun luratayna.
That’s not necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
No one wants to know.	Janiw khitis yatiñ munkiti.
He knew how to drink.	Jupax umañ yatïna.
That didn't mean anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.

And that’s why.	Ukat ukax kunatsa.
You can do that well.	Uk sum lurasma.
He is doing the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw luraski.
I kind of don’t do that.	Nayax mä juk’a janiw ukham lurkti.
There is something to be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa kuna lurañas utji.
I have never had that happen.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj utjkituti.
He does everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe kunsa luraski.
This is impossible to do.	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
I saw that today.	Jichhüruw uk uñjta.
No, he said it never mattered.	Janiwa, janipuniw kunas wakiskiti sasaw säna.

And no, he’s not at all.	Ukat janiwa, jupax janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
He asked for it.	Jupajj uk mayïna.
Or a little bit worse.	Jan ukax mä juk’a jan wali.
Didn't do much of anything.	Janiw kuns sinti lurkänti.
You know that, you know.	Jumax uk yatisktawa.
Why it really matters.	Kunatsa chiqpachansa ukax wakisi.
He’s done this before.	Jupax nayrax ukham luratayna.
And he doesn’t want that.	Ukat janiw uk munkiti.
That’s pretty quick.	Ukax wali jank’akiw.

Never had that for me, really.	Janipuniw ukax nayatakix utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
There was nothing before.	Nayrajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
But he did it himself.	Ukampis jupaw uk luräna.
No one understood anything.	Janiw khitis kuns amuykänti.
And he couldn't do it right.	Ukat janiw sum lurañ puedkänti.
But he couldn't go.	Ukampis janiw sarañ puedkänti.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis uk janiw lurkänti.

And now you, of course.	Ukat jichhax jumax, chiqpachansa.
And that’s all in a city.	Ukat ukax mä markanx taqi kunas utji.

You guys are the.	Jumanakajj uka...

Or he never wanted to.	Jan ukajj janipuniw munkänti.

It’s definitely worth the money.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw qullqix wali askiwa.
But also, whatever.	Ukampis ukhamarakiw, kunas.
Everything is out of control.	Taqi kunas janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.

But there is nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
There was no need to do this.	Janiw uk lurañax wakiskänti.
And so are you guys.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jumanakax.
You know how this goes.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams akax saraski.

He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
But it obviously wasn’t.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukhamäkänti.
But far, far away.	Ukampis jaya, jaya.

It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.

I don’t have any.	Janiw nayan utjkiti.
There was never anything.	Janipuniw kunas utjkänti.
But it turns out that this was not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti sasaw amuyasi.

But not all of these are necessary.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.

About that, of course.	Uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
You really don’t need to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
And it was for a while.	Ukat mä qhawqha tiempojj ukhamänwa.
He could not speak for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
And there was nothing.	Ukat janiw kunas utjkänti.

It’s this kind of person.	Ukax aka kasta jaqiwa.
He couldn't do it.	Janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
It’s a big one.	Mä jach’a.
For me, it’s the same.	Nayatakix ukhamaraki.
I don’t see anyone.	Janiw khitis uñjkti.
But it wasn’t, it wasn’t.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, janiw ukhamäkänti.

It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
You don’t need to do any more.	Janiw juk’amp lurañax wakiskiti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He refused to do so.	Jupajj uk janiw sasaw säna.
He didn't want to say no.	Jupajj janiw “janiw” sañ munkänti.

So he walked a little faster.	Ukatwa mä jukʼa jankʼak sarnaqäna.

No one wanted to help him.	Janiw khitis jupar yanaptʼañ munkänti.

That’s what you need to do.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi.
It’s not good for me.	Janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.

They can’t do nothing during the day.	Jupanakax janiw urux jan kuns lurañjamäkiti.
I want a drink.	Nayax mä umañ munta.

That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Actually, it happened.	Chiqpachansa, ukax pasäna.

It was never the first time.	Janipuniw nayrïr kuti ukhamäkänti.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parltʼañ munkiti.
It’s almost time for lunch.	Niya chika uru manq’añ pachaw purini.

Which he never did.	Kuntï jupax janipuniw lurkänti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don't like it very much.	Janiw nayarojj wal gustkituti.

He made it big.	Jupaw jachʼa luräna.

But it’s not all there is.	Ukampis janiw taqe kunas utjkiti.
He will one day.	Jupajj mä uruw ukham lurani.

To be honest, it is no better today.	Chiqpachansa, jichhürunakanxa janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.

He wants to control me.	Jupax nayar apnaqañ muni.
He’s definitely got it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham jikxatasïna.
This was by no means noticeable before.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa nayrajj amuyaskänti.

And seeing him again .	Ukat wasitat uñjasajj .
It doesn’t matter, he said.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, sasaw säna.
That wasn’t there.	Ukax janiw utjkänti.

That has never been a good thing for me.	Ukajj janipuniw nayatakejj wali askïkiti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It was really exciting.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.

He’s an amazing person.	Jupax wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.

But he was still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
You are a very nice guy.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
He wanted to know exactly how she was doing.	Jupajj kunjamsa sarnaqäna uk sum yatiñ munäna.

I’m still thinking about it.	Nayax wali amuyta.
I think that’s what works best for me.	Nayax amuyta, ukax nayatakix juk’amp askiwa.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
He said it twice.	Pä kutiw ukham säna.

In a positive way, of course.	Mä suma tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

He was surprisingly happy.	Jupajj muspharkañ kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But you know that was it.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamänwa uk jumajj yatisktawa.
But you need to do that first.	Ukampis uk nayraqat lurañaw wakisi.
But there was nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkänti.

That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.

He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.

He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.

It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.

He’s definitely doing it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw uk luraski.
He was devastated and depressed.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna ukat llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I want to do something.	Nayax kuns lurañ munta.

He felt a little better.	Jupajj mä jukʼa sum jikjjatasïna.
He didn't really want to.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun munkänti.
He wanted something else.	Jupajj yaqha kunsa munäna.
I did the same with mine.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw nayampejj lurawayta.
It’s really like that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
But he knows all about it.	Ukampis jupajj taqe ukanak yati.

You know what’s going on.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas pasaski.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Nayan, nayan, nayan.
No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want to tell her.	Jupajj janiw jupar yatiyañ munkänti.

He was right about that.	Jupajj uka toqet cheqapuniw säna.
He couldn't do anything about it.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
I have some time now, too.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw jichhax utjitu, ukhamaraki.
He feels it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jikjjatasi.
He plans everything that way.	Jupax taqi kuns ukham amti.
He didn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
I saw that immediately.	Ukaw jankʼak uñjta.

I want to see him.	Nayajj jupar uñjañ munta.
I don't know what causes this.	Kunas ukham luraspa uk janiw yatkti.

But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m right.	Nayamp chika.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He certainly saw it.	Chiqpachansa jupax uk uñjäna.
He didn't have anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
It really feels that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham amuyasi.
He certainly will.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukham lurani.
He immediately agreed with me.	Jupajj jankʼakiw nayamp iyaw säna.
But there was no time.	Ukampis janiw tiempojj utjkänti.
And he was like that.	Ukat jupax ukhamänwa.
Two or three years, he said.	Pä jan ukax kimsa maraw sasaw säna.
You already do that.	Jumax nayratpach ukham lurasma.
There is no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
He didn't really want to.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun munkänti.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañsa puedkänti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
So there is no immediate need.	Ukhamajj janiw jankʼak wakiskiti.
He didn't do anything wrong.	Jupajj janiw jan walinak lurkänti.
But that happened yesterday.	Ukampis ukajj qharüruw pasäna.
I don’t have anything.	Janiw kunas nayan utjkituti.
He was nobody.	Jupajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He told me that he was.	Jupajj sasaw sitäna.
And it was, of course.	Ukat ukhamänwa, chiqpachansa.
And I know exactly when.	Ukat kunapachas uk sum yatta.

But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
But there’s something interesting there.	Ukampis ukanx kunas wali askiwa.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I can’t believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Never, never never ever.	Janipuniw, janipuniw janipuniw kunapachas.
That’s exactly what’s going to happen.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunas pasani.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
I want to talk to him.	Nayajj jupampiw parltʼañ munta.

And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
But they’re not.	Ukampis jupanakax janiw.

And for a while there was nothing.	Ukat mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw kunas utjkänti.

Great, too.	Jach’a, ukhamaraki.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk lurañama.
You need to act quickly.	Jankʼakiw kuns lurañama.

He loved it so much.	Jupax wali munasiñampiw uñjäna.
And quickly, too.	Ukat jankʼakiw, ukhamaraki.
And indeed, it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.
I don’t think it’s about me.	Nayax janiw nayat ukham lurañ amtkti.

I’m pretty excited about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
And it just happened the other day.	Ukat nayrax mä urux ukhamakiw pasäna.
So we are not .	Ukhamajj janiw jiwasajj .
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t think so, of course.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
I mean absolutely.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw sañ munta.

I want to know why.	Kunatsa uk yatiñ munta.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
I understand that very well.	Uka toqet sum amuyasta.
There was nothing for me to do.	Nayatakejj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.

He loved to talk.	Jupajj parltʼañ wal munäna.

He is a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqewa.
So there is no other option.	Ukhamajj janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
He’s the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham lurawayi.
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayatakix ukax wali askiwa.
He is not like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know all of these things.	Taqe ukanak yattwa.
Until recently, it wasn’t.	Jichhakamax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I didn't want to talk to him about it.	Janiw jupamp uka toqet parlañ munkayätti.
For me, it wasn't.	Nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It may still need to be done.	Inas wali lurañax wakischispa.
I’m so happy for you.	Nayax jumatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
That’s a little bit.	Ukax mä juk’a.
Or anything, for that matter.	Jan ukax kuna, uka tuqitxa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
I would love to see more.	Jukʼamp uñjañ wal munta.
Today, that is not the case.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Or, for that matter, who did what to whom.	Jan ukax, uka tuqitxa, khitis khitirus kuns luräna.

It's a very nice guy.	Ukajj wali suma jaqewa.
And certainly not about that.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqitxa.

Everything is human.	Taqi kunas jaqiwa.
I just don’t understand it.	Nayax ukhamakiw jan sum amuyasta.

I don't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
I kind of agree.	Nayax mä juk’a iyaw sañ yatta.

There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He wasn't aware of it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet amuyaskänti.
But this is exactly the point.	Ukampis akax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
There’s nothing,’ he says.	Janiw kunas utjkiti’ sasaw saraki.
And he knows it.	Ukat uk yati.

But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.

It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.
But it doesn't work for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
Everything is first person.	Taqi kunas nayrïr jaqiwa.

The next day there was nothing.	Qhipürux janiw kunas utjkänti.
He gave it to me.	Jupaw uk churäna.
It doesn’t mean much.	Janiw sinti sañ munkiti.
He’s doing a lousy job.	Jupax mä jan wali irnaqäw luraski.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Janiw kunas pasaski uk yatkti.

Some money is worth it.	Mä qhawqha qullqix wali askiwa.
I never wanted to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañ munkayätti.
He never liked anyone much.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus wal munkänti.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he wanted to do that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham lurañwa munäna.
He didn't know how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw yatkänti.
He knew a thing or two.	Jupajj mä jan ukajj pä kunsa yatïna.
No one else did that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.

But for now, that’s worth it.	Ukampis jichhax ukax wali askiwa.
You need to do things better.	Jumajj jukʼamp sumwa kuns lurañama.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
There is a slight .	Ukax mä juk'a .
So he was like that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
You think of me.	Jumax nayat amuyta.
And that’s what it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamawa.
That’s what you like and that’s what you like.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa ukat ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.

No, he said, 'It's not.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj säna.
But that is by no means the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.

He meant it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw uk sañ munäna.

He was the one who did it.	Jupajj ukhamwa luräna.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
No one wanted that.	Janiw khitis uk munkänti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn't want to tell you that.	Nayajj janiw ukham yatiyañ munkayätti.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don't want to talk to him, really.	Janiw jupamp parltʼañ munkti, chiqpachansa.
But it was still worth it.	Ukampis wali askiwa.
He obviously cared for her.	Jupajj jupar sum uñjäna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He knew where it was.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk yatïna.
But really, you know that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, jumax uk yatisktawa.
But nothing seemed to be the case.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukham amuykänti.

He could not speak for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw parlañ puedkänti.

He didn’t know any other way.	Jupax janiw yaqha tuqit yatkänti.
There’s something there.	Ukanx kunas utji.
The day started out miserable.	Uka urux wali llakitaw qalltäna.
He’s a gentleman.	Jupax mä llamp’u jaqiwa.
He never liked it much.	Jupajj janipuniw walpun munkänti.
Well the money is worth it.	Suma qullqix wali askiwa.
You, too, are.	Jumax, ukhamaraki.

He did a very good job.	Jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
But he was still like that.	Ukampis jupax wali ukhamänwa.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
Now he knows exactly what he wants.	Jichhajj kuntï munki uk sum yati.
One day I just realized this.	Mä urux jichhakiw uk amuyasta.

I want him to do that.	Nayajj jupar ukham lurañapatakiw munta.

I never knew how to do it well.	Janipuniw ukanak sum lurañ yatkti.
I said they might.	Nayax jupanakax inas sasaw sista.

There is no one there.	Ukanx janiw khitis utjkiti.
I didn’t want money.	Janiw qollqe munkayätti.

But he’s already in bed.	Ukampis jupax niyaw ikiñan jikxatasïna.
It makes me happier.	Ukham lurasajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He did not say how.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk janiw siskänti.
It gave him a bit of a surprise.	Ukaw jupar mä jukʼa muspharkañ churäna.

You know, something like that.	Jumax yatisktawa, kunas ukham.
He wanted something more, so he left.	Jupajj jukʼamp kunsa munäna, ukatwa sarjjäna.
You’re better off.	Jumax juk’amp askiwa.

He means exactly what he says.	Kuntï siski uk sum sañ muni.

Or he was that way.	Jan ukajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
Not about that, either.	Janiw uka tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
Or for nothing at all.	Jan ukajj jan kunatsa.
Nobody wanted them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar munkänti.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkäti.
He didn't quite know that.	Jupajj janiw uk sum yatkänti.

I'm still enjoying it.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I don't think he ever liked me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayar gustkituti sasaw amuyta.

He was not in bed.	Jupajj janiw ikiñan utjkänti.
And it’s the same for me.	Ukat nayatakix ukhamarakiw.
It happens every day.	Sapa uruw ukax utji.

But it seems that this is not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
He will do so .	Jupajj ukham lurani .
That's what he's saying.	Ukaw jupajj siski.
No one needs to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
There are really two possibilities.	Chiqpachansa pä lurañaw utji.

This is never possible.	Ukax janipuniw lurañjamäkiti.
Anything else.	Kunas yaqha tuqitxa.
Definitely worth the money.	Chiqpachansa, uka qullqix wali askiwa.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He didn't know how it would turn out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
Now he knew about it.	Jichhajj uka toqet sum yatïna.
Munasmati or not.	Munasmati janicha.
No, that’s not a good thing.	Janiwa, ukax janiw askïkiti.
He walked quickly, anxiously.	Jupax jank’akiw sarnaqäna, llakitaw sarnaqäna.
I am really, really sorry.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa llakistwa.
He was leaving now in a hurry.	Jupajj jichhajj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.

I never saw him again.	Janipuniw mayampsa jupar uñjkti.

I really think that’s a good thing.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.

He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luräna.

But he did it, and he did it well.	Ukampis jupajj uk luräna, wali sumwa luräna.
And it obviously wasn’t.	Ukat qhanaw jan ukhamäkänti.
But he couldn't tell her all about it.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanak yatiyañ puedkänti.

Nothing like doing what you want.	Janiw kunas jumax kuntï munkta uk lurañjamäkiti.

But that didn't mean much.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti sañ munkänti.
You’re not like that.	Jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I felt the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw amuyayäta.
But he knows something.	Ukampis jupajj kunsa sum yati.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
But he felt better almost immediately.	Ukampis niya jankʼakiw sum jikjjatasïna.
He saw exactly what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum uñjäna.
Therefore,	Ukatwa, .
He has always wanted you.	Jupajj nayratpachaw jumar munäna.
But he could not do it alone.	Ukampis janiw sapaki uk lurañ puedkänti.
I never refused.	Janipuniw nayajj jan munkti.

He is not like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't do these things.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurkänti.

He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
No, there’s nothing there.	Janiwa, janiw kunas ukanx utjkiti.

That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

I didn’t do anything.	Nayax janiw kuns lurkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t think that’s it.	Janiw nayax ukanak amuykti.
He knew a lot about it.	Jupajj wal yatïna.
He wants to know something.	Jupajj kunsa yatiñ muni.
And it means immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw sañ muni.
I think it’s better.	Nayax amuyta, ukax juk’amp askiwa.

I have no idea what happened.	Kunas ukajj pasäna uk janiw amuykti.

He was a little worried.	Jupajj mä jukʼa llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
No one knows where.	Janiw khitis kawkhans uk yatkiti.
He was very cautious about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.

He’s really worried.	Jupax chiqpachansa llakitaw jikxatasi.
He has always been like that.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham sarnaqäna.
It gave a little bit.	Ukax mä juk’a churäna.
But that was not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukhamäkänti.
Not us at all.	Janiw jiwasax kunjamatsa.
I think he doesn’t like me.	Nayax amuyta, jupax janiw nayar gustkituti.
He’s the bad guy.	Jupax uka jan wali jaqiwa.
He really started himself.	Jupa pachpaw chiqpachapuni qalltäna.
There was no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkänti.
It was never the case.	Janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
He doesn’t know that.	Jupax janiw uk yatkiti.
He admitted it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham iyaw säna.
He said two.	Jupax pä sasaw säna.
That seemed to be the case.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
He really didn’t want that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk munkänti.
But he never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I said it was so.	Nayax ukhamawa sasaw sista.
I'm going to love it.	Nayajj walpun munta.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa lurañjamäkiti.
You can do both.	Panpachaniw lurasma.
I wonder what happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s doing a good job on his own.	Jupax sapakiw mä suma irnaqäw luraski.
I didn’t understand anything.	Janiw kuns amuykayätti.
But obviously not.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
That’s how it’s going to be.	Ukhamaw ukax utjani.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
But today, that was not the case.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I know something about that.	Uka toqet mä jukʼa yatta.

There’s no way to do all of this.	Janiw kunas taqi ukanak lurañax utjkiti.
What he was saying was clear.	Kuntï siskäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
But it happened yesterday.	Ukampis qharüruw ukham pasäna.
Or he loves it.	Jan ukax walpun munasi.
I’ve seen a little bit of it.	Nayax mä juk’a uñjta.
He told me what we were doing.	Jupaw kuntï lurapkta uk sitäna.

A long word.	Mä jaya aru.
Everything is good for me.	Taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa.
He knew it all along.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk yatïna.

Now it was like that.	Jichhajj ukhamänwa.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I didn't do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurkti.
I really don’t mean that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk sañ munkti.
I have something for you.	Nayax jumatakix kunas utjitu.
He means very well.	Jupax wali sum sañ muni.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was the only one who didn’t.	Jupa sapakiw jan ukham lurkänti.
It’s called money.	Ukax qullqi satawa.
He’s done so much for me.	Jupax nayatakix walpun lurawayi.
That was about three years ago.	Ukajj niya kimsa maraw pasäna.
But he didn't want to talk to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
A bad word.	Mä jan wali aru.
I don’t want to say that.	Nayax janiw ukham sañ munkti.
This is a very interesting one.	Akax wali askiwa.
And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know he will.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham lurani.
I never knew all that.	Janipuniw ukanak taqe kunsa yatkayätti.
Not the other way around.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa.

Or how that happened.	Jan ukajj kunjamsa ukajj pasäna.
I know how that feels.	Kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
He admitted it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk iyaw säna.
I actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurawayta.
But, I have .	Ukampis, nayajj .
I’ve had it for a long time.	Nayax jaya pachaw ukham jikxatastxa.
That’s how it started.	Ukhamaw qalltäna.
Well, he decided.	Ukhamawa, sasaw jupajj amtäna.
That is not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Why, why, why.	Kunatsa, kunatsa, kunatsa.
And painfully, he knew it all too well.	Ukat sinti llakitaw uka toqet sum yatïna.
He thought he might do something a little wrong.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jan walinak luraspa sasaw amuyäna.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
It felt like that twice.	Ukham pä kutiw ukham amuyasïna.
I really liked that.	Chiqpachansa ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
So everything happened so quickly.	Ukatwa taqe kunas jankʼak pasäna.
I really didn’t want this.	Chiqpachansa janiw akax munkayätti.
That’s what this is about.	Ukaw aka tuqitxa.
I've done something wrong.	Jan walinak lurawayta.
It never feels necessary.	Janipuniw ukax wakiskiti sasaw amuyasi.
We need to act faster.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp jankʼak lurañaw wakisi.
I’ve never done that but I want to do that badly.	Janiw kunapachas ukham lurkti ukampis ukham jan walinak lurañ munta.
That’s where it started.	Ukaw qalltäna.
Maybe half a day.	Inas chika uru.
There is not much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
I don't do that about it.	Janiw uka tuqitxa ukham lurkti.
But that was the case in the past.	Ukampis nayrajj ukhamänwa.

And indeed it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
I wonder who he is with now.	Jichhajj khitimpis jupajj utji sasaw jisktʼasta.
He wanted to know why.	Kunatsa uk yatiñ munäna.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He decided to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañwa amtäna.
And that’s always the case.	Ukat ukax sapa kutiw utji.
This is a long time in tennis.	Akax wali jaya pachaw tenis ukanx utji.
That’s how it felt.	Ukhamaw ukham amuyasïna.
That’s totally fine.	Ukax taqpach wali askiwa.
On the negative side, there is nothing about it.	Uka jan wali tuqitxa, janiw kunas uka tuqitxa utjkiti.
And he didn't do anything.	Ukat janiw kuns lurkänti.
I didn't want to.	Janiw nayajj munkayätti.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Not a certain amount of time now.	Janiw mä qhawqha tiempojj jichhajj utjkiti.
This was rare.	Ukajj janiw sinti utjkänti.
He didn't have it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak utjkänti.

This is not good, either.	Akax janiw askïkiti, ukhamaraki.

And that is what happened in this case.	Ukat ukax aka tuqitxa ukhamarakiw pasäna.
But obviously not.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
There was never that time.	Janipuniw uka tiempojj utjkänti.

So this is .	Ukhamajj aka .
So he decides not to see her again.	Ukatwa jan mayamp uñjañ amti.
I wanted to see him alone for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempo sapakiw jupar uñjañ munta.
It wasn't the way it was supposed to be.	Janiw kunjamtï lurañapäkäna ukhamäkänti.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But it's not what you think it is.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumajj amuykta ukhamäkiti.

So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He did it, no, he did that.	Jupax uk luratayna, janiwa, jupax ukham luratayna.
He’s such a great guy.	Jupax ukham jach’a jaqiwa.

And he didn't say anything.	Ukat janiw kuns siskänti.
He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
This is clearly not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He’s been around for a very long time.	Jupax wali jaya pachaw ukham sarnaqäna.
I want to do something big.	Nayax mä jach’a lurañ munta.
No one is here at noon.	Chika urux janiw khitis akan utjkiti.

He didn't want to buy anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns alañ munkänti.

There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.

No need to make a big deal about it.	Janiw uka toqet mä jachʼa lurañajj wakiskiti.
He didn’t say that, of course.	Janiw jupax ukham siskänti, chiqpachansa.
It was a slow motion.	Ukhamaw amuyasïna.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
No one knew about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet yatkänti.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.

He was the one who decided it.	Jupaw uk amtäna.
That's what he said.	Ukaw jupajj säna.
I totally understand that.	Nayax uk taqpach amuyta.
I just can’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukanak lurañjamäkiti.

I don't know how to do it that well now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham sum lurañ yatkti.
He saw her immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupar uñjäna.
I don’t see it.	Janiw uñjkti.
He did a very good job.	Jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
Therefore , it is not	Ukhamajj janiw .
And he’s a nice guy.	Ukat jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He was something other than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa yaqha ukhamänwa.
How that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna.
It didn’t exist before.	Janiw nayrax utjkänti.
He wants to use force.	Jupax ch’amampiw apnaqañ muni.
I don't want to do that anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp ukham lurañ munkti.
He didn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.

He’s not like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know that's a good thing.	Nayajj uk sum yatta.

That was what he felt good about.	Ukaw jupajj wali sum jikjjatasïna.
That didn't mean that.	Ukajj janiw ukham sañ munkänti.

And I know exactly why.	Ukat kunatsa uk sum yatta.
He understood the point.	Jupajj uka toqet sum amuyasïna.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Janiw khitirus uñjañ munkti.

For a long time he couldn't.	Mä jaya tiempojj janiw puedkänti.
He knows everything well.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sum yati.
It went pretty fast.	Ukajj wali jankʼakiw saräna.
This is not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
But that was something else for me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj yaqha ukhamänwa.
He didn't know how to react.	Jupajj kunjamsa kuns lurani uk janiw yatkänti.
So no time is needed!.	¡Ukhamajj janiw tiempojj wakiskiti!.
he thought to himself.	sasaw amuyäna.
You don’t have to go anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha chiqar sarañax wakiskiti.
I think you would like it.	Jumax munasmati sasaw amuyta.
I wonder how he feels.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasi sasaw jisktʼasta.
He never did that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kun lurañsa janiw yatkänti.
There isn’t much to do about the former.	Nayrïr tuqitx janiw sinti lurañax utjkiti.

I really want to know how to do everything.	Chiqpachansa kunjamsa taqi kun lurañ yatiñ munta.
I really didn’t need to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
He’s the reason.	Jupaw kunatsa.
Another guy did exactly the same thing.	Yaqha waynax pachpa chiqpachapuniw luratayna.
That's what I thought.	Ukhamaw nayajj amuyayäta.
There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.
But I don't understand your point.	Ukampis janiw jumanakan kuntï siskta uk amuykti.
He didn't really know for sure.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun sum yatkänti.
It was a very happy experience.	Ukajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he’s not like that.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
So maybe I should go now.	Ukhamaw inas jichhax sarañax wakischispa.
You’re welcome!.	¡Jumax wali askiwa!.
He went every year.	Jupajj sapa maraw saräna.
It was doing quite well.	Ukajj wali sumwa luraskäna.
I didn't want to say anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns sañ munkayätti.

I never want that again.	Janipuniw mayampsa uk munkti.
I didn’t want to tell anyone.	Janiw khitirus yatiyañ munkayätti.

He knew how she felt.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

And it’s worth every penny.	Ukat sapa qullqix wali askiwa.

Now you have to do it again.	Jichhax wasitat lurañaw wakisi.
I never knew it.	Nayajj janipuniw yatkti.
But it kind of feels that way.	Ukampis mä juk’a ukham jikxatasi.
He didn't want anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns munkänti.
That’s the kind of guy he is.	Uka kasta waynax jupax ukhamawa.
I don't feel it at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa jikjjatasta.
It can't be done that fast.	Janiw ukham jankʼak lurañjamäkiti.

And it was a very painful experience.	Ukat wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.

I didn't do it.	Janiw nayajj uk lurkti.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
He didn't understand all of this.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa amuykänti.
That means for no reason.	Ukajj jan kunatsa sañ muni.
But he doesn’t want them.	Ukampis janiw jupanakar munkiti.
Great room and kitchen.	Jach’a uta ukat manq’añ uta.
He almost did it.	Jupajj niyaw uk luräna.
But he didn't want her.	Ukampis janiw jupar munkänti.

He is a truly remarkable man.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.
He knew what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.

No one wanted to say anything.	Janiw khitis kuns sañ munkänti.
I didn't tell him that.	Janiw nayajj ukham jupar siskti.
And, what .	Ukat, kunas .
So nothing is impossible.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas jan lurañjamäkiti.
That is not the case today.	Jichhürunakanxa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He moved very quickly.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.

Or so she was telling him.	Jan ukajj ukhamakiw jupar siskäna.

There is nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkiti.
He didn't want to talk any more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp parlañ munkänti.
And he decided to do better.	Ukat jukʼamp sum lurañwa amtäna.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.

He doesn’t understand anything, really.	Jupax janiw kuns amuykiti, chiqpachansa.
A little bit of a different kind.	Mä juk’a yaqha kasta.
Or you can do both.	Jan ukajj panpachaniw lurasma.
So these are the things that need to be done.	Ukhamajj ukanak lurañaw wakisi.
Everything seemed strange and sinister.	Taqe kunas muspharkañ ukat jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
and everything else.	ukat taqi kuna.

Nothing is ever good enough.	Janiw kunas kunapachas askïkiti.
This was not the case at all.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkänti.
He had just realized something.	Jupajj jichhakiw kuns amuyäna.
There was no need to do this.	Janiw uk lurañax wakiskänti.
Maybe they’re pretty nearly, you know.	Inas jupanakax wali niya, jumax yatisktawa.
But I didn't know exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum yatkayätti.
Now it was like that.	Jichhajj ukhamänwa.
Would you like to know more?.	¿Jukʼamp yatiñ munasmati?.
He was very happy about it.	Uka tuqitxa jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He said it was the same day.	Uka pachpa uruw sasaw säna.

Very nice, very nice.	Wali suma, wali suma.
On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
I usually use both.	Nayax panpachaniw apnaqañ yatta.
I'm going to do the same.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw.
He was doing that.	Jupajj ukham luraskäna.
It never occurred to me that I didn't need it.	Nayatakejj janiw ukajj wakiskiti sasin janipuniw amuykänti.
That’s a good thing for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That’s exactly what happened.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunas pasäna.
But he felt good about it.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa wali sumwa jikxatasïna.
A beautiful day.	Mä suma uru.
But the point is .	Ukampis uka tuqitxa .
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
But that is rare.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti utjkiti.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s still worth it now.	Jichhax wali askiwa.
I’ve seen it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham uñjta.
He began to smile.	Jupax qalltäna.
They like you a lot.	Jupanakajj jumar wal gusti.
That's a good thing for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
I don't know.	Janiw yatkti.
No one wants to help them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar yanaptʼañ munkiti.
That’s a good thing for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
He wanted that for me.	Jupaw ukanak nayar munäna.
But it doesn’t exist yet, either.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax utjkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think he meant it.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uk sañ munäna.
Today, there is every reason to do so.	Jichhürunakanjja, taqe kunatsa ukham lurañatakejj utji.
That’s the way it is .	Ukax ukhamawa .
How do you know that? 	¿Kunjamsa jumajj uk yatta?
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
Or at least one needs to be done.	Jan ukajj mä lurañaw wakisi.
Several times, in fact.	Walja kutiw, chiqpachansa.
I want to buy a new car.	Mä machaq auto alañ munta.
You will need some alone time.	Mä jukʼa tiempo sapakiw munasini.
Everything is nice and delicious.	Taqi kunas suma ukat wali suma.
So he seemed to be the worst.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I don’t need to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
I’ve seen it that way.	Nayax ukham uñjta.
Obviously it’s not.	Qhanaw janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And it has done so for a long time.	Ukat walja tiempow ukham lurawayi.
I’m sorry about that.	Nayax ukat llakistwa.
Maybe he 's .	Inas jupajj .
I’m a little disappointed.	Nayax mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatastxa.
But there is only one.	Ukampis mä sapakiw.
He said nothing to help her.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupar yanaptʼañatakejj siskänti.
I never knew that.	Janipuniw uk yatkti.
They are really interesting.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
I didn’t want to see them.	Janiw jupanakar uñjañ munkayätti.
He left immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
That’s what you need.	Ukaw wakisi.
There’s nothing, there’s nothing!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti, ¡janiw kunas utjkiti!.
No one knows yet.	Janiw khitis jichhakamax uk yatkiti.
You are not allowed, you are not allowed, you are not allowed.	Jumax janiw satawa, jumax janiw satawa, jumax janiw satawa.
Now he was feeling better.	Jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He wanted to do these things.	Jupajj ukanak lurañwa munäna.
I don't care what you say.	Kuntï jumajj siskta ukajj janiw nayatak wakiskiti.
And obviously not.	Ukat qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.

Or, really, do it.	Jan ukax, chiqpachansa, lurañaw wakisi.
I have only one.	Nayax mä sapakiw utjitu.
I kind of understand why.	Kunatsa uk mä jukʼa amuyasta.
A lot happened fast.	Walja kunas jankʼakiw pasäna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
And so it happened.	Ukat ukhamarakiw pasäna.
He knew nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kunsa yatkänti.
He said he didn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatkti sasaw säna.
He said that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
That’s what you .	Ukax jumax .
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
It’s time to act on it.	Uka tuqit lurañ pachaw purini.
It just means that.	Ukajj ukhamakiw sañ muni.
Didn't really mean that.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham sañ munkänti.
But in that respect.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
So that was a year.	Ukhamajj ukajj mä maraw pasäna.
Would you like to do more?.	¿Jukʼamp lurañ munasmati?.
That’s none of this.	Ukax janiw kunas akax utjkiti.
I still have only one.	Nayax wali mä sapakiw utjitu.
He is in love with her.	Jupajj munasiñampiw jikjjatasi.
I understand why I want to do this.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ munta uk sum amuyasta.
But that's how he likes it.	Ukampis ukham jupajj wal gusti.
But still something wasn't clear.	Ukampis wali kunas janiw sum amuyaskänti.
And that means he did it here.	Ukat ukax jupax akan luratayna sañ muni.
I want to talk to you.	Nayajj jumamp parltʼañ munta.
But that is not really possible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw cheqpachapun lurañjamäkiti.
So there was no one.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
I know that's it.	Nayajj uk yattwa.
What is it that you .	Kunas ukajj jumanakan .
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
He’s still in pain.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s absolutely true.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw chiqpachapuni.
That wasn't there.	Ukajj janiw utjkänti.
I’m telling you the truth.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw sista.
That was something I never thought of.	Ukajj janipuniw nayajj amuykayätti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munasi.
I'm not sure.	Nayax yattwa.
But that was the case.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamänwa.
But I don't know about that.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa janiw yatkti.
I’m not going to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
He understood that perfectly.	Jupajj uk sum amuyäna.
He told me one day.	Jupajj mä uruw sitäna.
He however refuses to use this.	Jupax ukampis janiw aka apnaqañ munkiti.
That’s what happened.	Ukaw pasäna.
I completely understand.	Nayax taqpach amuyta.
He didn't know why he felt that way.	Kunatsa ukham jikjjatasïna uk janiw yatkänti.
You need to do so quickly.	Jankʼakiw ukham lurañama.
I don’t see it that way.	Janiw ukham uñjkti.
Therefore .	Ukatwa .
I think that’s a good thing for me.	Nayatakix ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
No one knew exactly what happened to them.	Kunas jupanakar pasäna uk janiw khitis sum yatkänti.
I want to know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiñ munta.
I don't have to do it right.	Janiw nayajj sum lurañajj wakiskiti.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa lurkänti.
He still didn’t know for sure.	Jupax wali jan sum yatïna.
He moved faster.	Jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
I don’t want to say that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkti.
This is my first year here.	Akax nayrïr maraw akan jikxatasi.

That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
And it doesn't have to be that way.	Ukat janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
Everything is good for you.	Taqi kunas jumatakix wali askiwa.
He didn't want to tell the truth.	Jupajj janiw cheq parlañ munkänti.
It is happening fast.	Ukajj jankʼakiw pasaski.
He is his own man.	Jupa pachpa jaqiwa.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I really want to see him.	Jupar uñjañ wal munta.
He knows exactly where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk sum yati.
He knows that I am sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasta uk sum yati.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
He went alone.	Jupax sapakiw saräna.
There’s nothing there for me.	Nayatakix janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
But he didn't understand it.	Ukampis janiw uk amuykänti.
I mean really really good.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali askiwa sañ munta.
It was discovered.	Ukajj jikjjatasïna.
I want to do something better.	Nayax mä juk’amp suma lurañ munta.
I didn’t think he would do that.	Ukham lurañap janiw amuyirïkti.

He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I think very quickly.	Nayax wali jank’akiw amuyta.
That’s how he feels.	Ukhamaw jupax jikxatasi.
I don’t know how to do this.	Nayax janiw kunjams uk lurañax yatkti.
He happened to see you.	Jupaw jumar uñjasajj pasäna.
Or he didn't say it.	Jan ukajj janiw siskänti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

Well you do too.	Suma jumax ukhamarakiw.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
He lives a very happy life.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jakasi.
I cannot say more than that.	Janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp siskti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
This is not the case before.	Ukax janiw nayrax ukhamäkiti.

It’s a nice guy.	Mä suma jaqiwa.

But, it’s not like that.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkiti.
It will happen and it will happen for sure.	Ukax pasani ukat chiqpachapuniw pasani.
And that happened yesterday.	Ukat ukax qharüruw pasäna.
Now I have found him.	Jichhajj jupar jikjjatasta.
I never knew that.	Janipuniw uk yatkayätti.
I enjoyed doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wal kusista.
He didn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa yatkänti.
Very nice house.	Wali suma uta.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I wasn't even that good at it.	Nayajj janiw ukham sum lurañsa yatkayätti.
I've done that before though.	Ukanx nayrax ukham lurawayta ukampis.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkänti.
I’m so excited about this.	Nayax wali kusisitaw aka tuqitx jikxatastxa.
And I didn’t do that.	Ukat nayax janiw ukham lurkti.

And he knew it well.	Ukat jupax uk sum yatïna.
But another time.	Ukampis yaqha kuti.
I don't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
But it doesn’t mean anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
I don’t know exactly what it is.	Janiw kunas uk sum yatkti.
You should do the same.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw lurañama.
Almost too good.	Niya sinti suma.
I do no more or less than that.	Janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp jan ukajj jukʼamp lurkti.

I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He’s the only one who can do anything with her.	Jupa sapakiw jupamp kuns luraspa.
I don’t, of course.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti, chiqpachansa.
A little bit every day.	Mä juk’a sapa uru.
There was nothing to back it up.	Ukar yanaptʼañatakejj janiw kunas utjkänti.
This is obviously necessary.	Ukajj qhanaw wakisi.
He did much better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna.
It was almost like a villain.	Niya mä jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I didn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkti.
But it’s not what you think it is.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
I don’t have sleep deprivation.	Nayax janiw ikiñan jan sum uñjkti.
But he must act quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw kuns lurañapa.
I don't see how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk uñjkti.
I mean this for sure.	Nayax akax chiqpachapuniw sañ munta.
He was in a bad mood.	Jupajj jan wal amuyasïna.
It’s always there.	Sapa kutiw utji.
You know it doesn’t.	Jumax yatisktawa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s doing that.	Jupax ukham luraski.
he says, 'It's not.	sasaw saraki.
It will arrive tomorrow.	Ukax qharüruw purini.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
But almost everything is good.	Ukampis niya taqe kunas wali askiwa.
It may be a long process.	Inas jaya tiempo lurañax wakischispa.
He wasn't like that before.	Jupajj janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
But he loves it so much.	Ukampis jupajj walpun munasi.
He didn't do these things.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurkänti.
And both of these .	Ukat uka pä tuqitxa .
And that’s what I like about it.	Ukat ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It can’t be that way.	Janiw ukham utjkaspati.
I know how to do it.	Nayajj kunjamsa uk lurañ yatta.
He took good care of it.	Jupajj sum uñjäna.
Once, twice, three times.	Mä kuti, pä kuti, kimsa kuti.

He took care of her.	Jupaw jupar uñjäna.
I think, actually.	Nayax amuyta, chiqpachansa.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
No one knows about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet yatkiti.
I am very, very disappointed.	Nayax wali, wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
You are welcome.	Janiw kunatsa.
He never wanted it anyway.	Jupajj janipuniw kunjamatsa uk munkänti.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
He never knew it.	Jupajj janipuniw yatkänti.
He says he sees nothing now.	Jichhax janiw kuns uñjkti sasaw saraki.
What does this mean?.	¿Kunsa ukajj sañ muni?.
Do this twice a day.	Uka urux pä kutiw ukham lurañama.
He just did it right away.	Jupajj ukhamakiw luräna.
I'm not sure what to do.	janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.
He knew why he did it.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luräna uk sum yatïna.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
You need to do that, too.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi, ukhamaraki.
Or with you.	Jan ukajj jumamp chika.
I just can’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
But it’s not like that.	Ukampis janiw ukham sañjamäkiti.
He did it again.	Jupax wasitat luratayna.
Isn’t that a .	¿Janit ukajj mä .
That, he said, was unnecessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti sasaw jupajj säna.
It didn’t mean anything to me.	Janiw nayatakix kuns sañ munkänti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luräna.
I think it’s a good idea.	Nayax wali suma amuyumpiw amuyta.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
I will never do it again.	Janiw mayampsa uk lurkäti.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukham amuyasïna.
No, he said.	Janiwa, sasaw säna.
He’s very good to me.	Jupax nayatakix wali askiwa.
And coffee, of course.	Ukat café, chiqpachansa.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luräna.
He was a man’s man, she thought.	Jupax chachan jaqiwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
But he is a very nice guy.	Ukampis jupajj wali suma jaqewa.
I’ve never seen it all that much.	Janipuniw ukham taqpach uñjkti.
And of course he was.	Ukat chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti.
He immediately saw the effect.	Ukat jankʼakiw kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk uñjäna.
But really, that doesn’t mean anything right now.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukax janiw jichhax kuns sañ munkiti.
He started talking about nothing and nothing .	Jupaw jan kuna ukat kuna tuqit parltʼañ qalltäna .
I want to know more about it.	Uka toqet jukʼamp yatiñ munta.
Not that he isn't.	Janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
Now, that seems unlikely.	Jichhax, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
I never said anything.	Janipuniw kuns siskti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew he really meant it.	Chiqpachansa ukham sañ munäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
That’s what it means.	Ukaw sañ muni.
He knew it all along.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk yatïna.
He didn't know what he wanted.	Jupajj janiw kuntï munkäna uk yatkänti.
You’re a great guy.	Jumax jach’a jaqiwa.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
Here, there is nothing.	Akax, janiw kunas utjkiti.
Did almost nothing.	Niya janiw kuna lurañas lurkänti.
What do you think of the scene? 	¿Kunsa jumajj amuyta?
Why exactly.	Kunatsa chiqpachansa.
Anyone know how to do that yet?.	¿Khitis jichhakamax ukham lurañ yati?.
Never had one before.	Janipuniw mä nayrax utjkänti.
He’s a very very nice guy.	Jupax wali wali suma jaqiwa.
Well done, very well done.	Suma lurawayi, wali sum lurawayi.
Very well he refused.	Wali sumwa jupax jan munkänti.
I can see it clearly now.	Jichhajj sum uñjta.
That’s the way it is.	Ukhamaw uka tuqitxa.
It’s doing it well.	Uk sum luraski.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
He decided it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk amtäna.
And, really, it doesn’t matter.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, janiw ukax wakiskiti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn't do anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurkti.
He's a great guy.	Jupax jach'a jaqiwa.
It’s never something always or never.	Janipuniw kunas sapa kuti jan ukax janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't know how to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ yatkänti.
Or so she told me.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj sitäna.
But this isn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw akax ukhamäkiti.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
He’s a really nice guy.	Chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
There was no reason to be rude.	Janiw kunatsa jan walinak lurañajj wakiskänti.
It’s all about me.	Taqi kunas nayatakix ukhamawa.
So I feel that very well.	Ukhamajj uk wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parltʼañ munkiti.
With me, right now.	Nayamp chika, jichhax.
The guy just wanted to know.	Uka waynax ukhamakiw yatiñ munäna.
And he did everything right.	Ukat jupax taqi kuns sum luräna.
That is what you have to do.	Ukaw jumajj lurañama.
I wasn't sure how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
So he was like that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
He had nothing to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañas utjkänti.
Maybe I think of something.	Inas kuns amuyta.
I want to tell you.	Nayax jumanakar yatiyañ munta.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I wonder what it was.	¿Kunas ukhamänwa sasaw jisktʼasta.
He knew just as well.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw sum yatïna.
And now, this.	Ukat jichhax, aka.
It’s soft and effective.	Ukax llamp’u ukat wali askiwa.
Something obviously happened.	Kunas qhanaw pasäna.
There is no such thing.	Janiw ukham lurañajj utjkiti.
I didn’t see anything.	Janiw kuns uñjkti.
He did a very good job.	Jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
He didn't quite know why.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa sum yatkänti.

That’s what he realized.	Ukaw amuyasïna.
Not this is the case.	Janiw akax ukhamäkiti.
It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
That is certainly the case here.	Ukajj cheqapuniw akan utji.
But that's what I like.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
But that is exactly what happened in this case.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa chiqpachapuniw ukham pasäna.
Money isn’t like that.	Qullqix janiw ukhamäkiti.
It doesn’t really matter.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukax wakiskiti.
I don’t know what this is.	Nayax janiw kunas akax uk yatkti.
He needs more light.	Jupajj jukʼamp qhanaw munasi.
And then it began.	Ukat ukat qalltäna.
It does everything very quickly.	Taqi kuns wali jank’akiw luraski.
I am glad to see that he is doing so.	Ukham luraski uk uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
Maybe that’s nothing.	Inas ukax jan kunas utjkaspati.
That time never existed.	Uka tiempojj janipuniw utjkänti.
There are always two sides.	Sapa kutiw pä tuqit utji.
But it really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
Now he was feeling better.	Jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He wanted it very much.	Jupajj walpun uk munäna.
I didn't know.	Nayajj janiw yatkayätti.
You know we are .	Jumax yatisktawa jiwasax .
But he saw his point.	Ukampis jupajj kuntï siskäna uk sumwa uñjäna.
He was very active.	Jupajj wal chʼamachasïna.
Better to do something about it, he thought.	Uka tuqit kuns lurañax jukʼamp askiwa, sasaw amuyäna.

Jaya is a great guy.	Jaya jach’a.
What happened the other night.	Kunas yaqha arumax pasäna.
What happened to you.	Kunas jumamp pasäna.
He decides to do the first one.	Jupax nayrïr lurañ amti.
Both of you are.	Panpachaniw jumanakax.
I would never do that.	Nayajj janipuniw uk lurañ munkti.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s saying something.	Ukax mä kuns sañ muni.
He said again and again.	Jupajj wasitatwa säna.
He wanted to stay in the house.	Uka utan qhiparañ munäna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
I never liked it at all.	Janipuniw kunjamatsa gustkituti.
So he bought it for me.	Ukatwa jupajj nayatak alasïna.
But there was nothing beyond that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa janiw kunas utjkänti.
He just likes it that way.	Jupajj ukhamakiw gusti.
Now we have to do that again.	Jichhax wasitat ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Maybe all of the above.	Inas taqi ukanak lurañax wakischispa.
I feel all that energy.	Taqi uka ch’amampiw jikxatastxa.

So they were like that.	Ukhamajj jupanakajj ukhamänwa.
I knew that for sure.	Nayajj uk sum yatiyäta.
Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
Or maybe I should.	Jan ukajj inas nayajj wakischispa.

You, here with me.	Jumax, akan nayamp chika.
But he is like that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamawa.
He did a very good job.	Jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
There really is nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkiti.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
Now it’s really now.	Jichhax chiqpachapuniw jichhax.
I didn’t understand, why.	Nayax janiw amuykayätti, kunatsa.
That’s not very good.	Ukax janiw sinti askïkiti.
It was really exciting.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But no one really needs to.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw khitis ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
In this case we .	Uka tuqitxa jiwasax .
This is not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
I’m sorry about that.	Nayax uka tuqit llakistwa.
He has done so much for me.	Jupajj walpun nayatak lurawayi.

Whatever though, of course.	Kunas ukampis, chiqpachansa.

And he .	Ukat jupax .
He couldn't tell anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitirus yatiyañ puedkänti.
He says he doesn’t.	Jupax janiw sasaw saraki.
It was either him or nothing.	Jupaw jan ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
He decided to do something on his own.	Jupa pachpaw kuns lurañ amtäna.
I’m sure you can do better than that.	Nayax yatxatwa jumax ukat sipan juk’amp sum lurasma.
Any kind, he says.	Kuna kasta, sasaw jupax saraki.
I know that’s a good thing.	Nayax uk sum yatta.
He didn't know what we were doing.	Jupajj janiw kuntï lurapkta uk yatkänti.
But now he could do nothing.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
But so far nothing has happened.	Ukampis jichhakamax janiw kunas utjkiti.
You need some alone time.	Mä jukʼa tiempo sapakiw munasi.

Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
But you know that.	Ukampis jumax ukham yatisktawa.

So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
But it is obvious.	Ukampis qhanaw amuyasi.
I disagree with you.	Nayajj janiw jumamp iyaw siskti.
This was not the case at all.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkänti.
In the case of you.	Uka tuqitxa jumax.
He loved the place.	Jupajj uka cheqar walpun munäna.
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
But the process went quickly.	Ukampis uka lurañajj jankʼakiw saräna.
But it started almost immediately.	Ukampis niya jankʼakiw qalltäna.
Now I see it differently.	Jichhax yaqha tuqit uñjta.
I have always been able to do this.	Nayajj nayratpachaw uk lurañ yatta.
It wasn't like that before.	Nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He’s the one who knows everything.	Jupaw taqe kun yati.
But you understand well.	Ukampis jumax sum amuyta.
The reason for this is obvious.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
There was nothing like it.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
Every penny is worth it.	Sapa qullqix wali askiwa.

This is the case.	Akax ukhamawa.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never thought this would happen now.	Jichhajj ukham pasani uk janipuniw amuykayätti.
I never wanted anything more.	Janipuniw jukʼamp kunsa munkayätti.
He didn't understand it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak sum amuykänti.

And that wasn’t somewhere with nobody.	Ukat ukax janiw kawkhans jan khitimpis utjkänti.

He did things exactly as you said.	Jupajj kunjamtï jumajj siskta ukhamwa kuns luräna.
I'm still enjoying it.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He doesn't understand you.	Jupajj janiw jumar amuykiti.

There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
I don't understand that.	Nayajj janiw uk amuykti.
But more needs to be done.	Ukampis jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
I'm not the one who's.	Janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.
I am very happy with yours.	Nayax jumanakan wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He started going there every day.	Jupajj sapa uruw ukar sarañ qalltäna.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw uk luratayna.

He’s the best person I’ve ever met.	Jupax nayatakix wali suma jaqiwa.
And he didn’t do that.	Ukat jupax janiw ukham lurkänti.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.

He is doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraski.
For me, it wasn't.	Nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkänti.

He’s a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
It was really sad for me.	Chiqpachansa, nayatakix wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
So you need to do that.	Ukhamajj jumajj ukham lurañaw wakisi.
But that is not the best way to do it.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wali askïkiti.
Who does it.	Khitis lurani.
I want to make some coffee.	Nayax mä juk’a café lurañ munta.
But he meant something.	Ukampis kun sañ munäna.

There’s a light there.	Ukanx mä qhanaw utji.
He says that’s really good.	Ukax chiqpachans wali askiwa sasaw saraki.

He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
There’s nothing there.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I didn’t think so much of it.	Janiw ukham sinti amuykayätti.
I don't believe that now.	Jichhajj janiw uk creykti.
He wanted something.	Jupajj kunsa munäna.
There is no need to do this.	Janiw uk lurañax wakiskiti.

So nobody .	Ukhamajj janiw khitis .
And so, that’s it.	Ukat ukhamawa, ukhamawa.
I don't want to tell you anything.	Janiw nayajj kuns yatiyañ munkti.
I’m still strongly against this.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw aka tuqitxa.

There’s definitely something to that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa kunas utji.

I’ve always wanted to go there.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukar sarañ munta.
But he said nothing about it to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitirus uka toqet kuns siskänti.
He needs them all the time.	Jupajj jupanakajj sapa kutiw munasi.

But that was not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

He didn't know what to say to her.	Jupajj kuntï jupar sañ munkäna uk janiw yatkänti.
He decides to do something about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kun lurañwa amti.
He doesn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I hope it arrives soon.	Ukax jank’akiw purini sasaw suyt’askta.

So he didn't say anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns siskänti.
It feels really good to do nothing.	Chiqpachansa jan kuns lurañaw wali suma jikxatasi.
And he said it again.	Ukat jupajj wasitatwa säna.

But it goes every day or so.	Ukampis sapa uru jan ukajj niya ukhamarakiw saraski.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s fine, but that’s it.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukampis ukax ukhamawa.
That really isn’t necessary.	Chiqpachansa ukax janiw wakiskiti.

He didn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.
He thought he didn’t know what it was.	Jupax janiw kunas uk yatkiti sasaw amuyäna.
He’s the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham lurawayi.
He is doing it with good judgment.	Suma amuyumpiw uk luraski.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
He’s real about this, of course.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw aka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
But this one did that.	Ukampis akax ukham luräna.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
A bad one.	Mä jan wali.
I never liked it that much.	Janipuniw ukham gustkituti.
But not today.	Ukampis janiw jichhürunakanxa.
He felt like he was two people.	Jupajj pä jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
He needed nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kunsa wakiskänti.
Fortunately, he did.	Wali askiwa, jupajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
But it is not enough to help.	Ukampis janiw yanaptʼañatakejj wakiskiti.
That’s what he’s supposed to do.	Ukhamaw jupax lurañapa.
He felt like a very bad person.	Jupajj wali jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
It happens so fast.	Ukham jankʼakiw pasaski.
I already understand that.	Nayax uk nayratpach amuyta.
We don’t have one.	Jiwasax janiw mä.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
But I am happy with it.	Ukampis nayajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I don’t remember why.	Janiw kunatsa amtaskti.
He felt the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasïna.
This is the best thing for you.	Akax jumatakix wali askiwa.
He doesn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkiti.
I see something in you.	Nayax jumanakan kuns uñjta.
I wonder what happened.	Kunas pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I now understand why.	Kunatsa uk jichhajj amuyasta.
Not what he wanted obviously.	Janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He doesn’t, not really.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
You may need to do the same.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw inas wakischispa.
This is often impossible.	Ukajj walja kutiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He wanted to talk to her about it.	Jupampiw uka toqet parltʼañ munäna.
They’re still worth it.	Jupanakax wali askiwa.
So therefore .	Ukhamajj ukhamajj .
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And it’s worth it in that regard.	Ukat uka tuqitxa wali askiwa.

I want to go again.	Nayax wasitat sarañ munta.
He was nobody, nobody.	Jupax janiw khitis, janiw khitis ukhamäkänti.
But it didn’t feel that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
But that will take a day or two.	Ukampis ukajj mä uru jan ukajj pä uruw pasani.
A little .	Mä jukʼa .
This is the best thing I’ve ever done.	Akax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I never said that.	Janipuniw ukham siskti.
That’s what happened that day.	Ukaw uka urux pasäna.
Very sad about this.	Wali llakitaw aka tuqitxa.
He said that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
It wasn't necessary.	Janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
I understand myself.	Naya pachpaw amuyasta.
I feel much better.	Nayajj jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasta.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to go.	Sarañ munta.
I didn’t say anything.	Janiw nayax kuns siskti.
I know it takes time.	Nayax yattwa ukax tiempow munasi.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
Two things happened immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw pä kunas pasäna.

That’s what feels really good.	Ukaw chiqpachansa wali sum jikxatasi.
I don’t want to know, really.	Janiw yatiñ munkti, chiqpachansa.
I never wanted a big house.	Janipuniw mä jachʼa uta munkti.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
There’s something there.	Ukanx kunas utji.
He doesn’t know anything about it.	Jupax janiw kuns uka tuqit yatkiti.
He was very happy to do so.	Uk lurasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Nobody wants that.	Janiw khitis ukanak munkiti.
And he never did that.	Ukat janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
He wanted to see her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar uñjañ munäna.
I want that very much.	Uk walpun munta.
The same language.	Pachpa aru.
Now, that’s good enough.	Jichhax, ukax wali askiwa.
But no one did it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
But I don’t see that.	Ukampis janiw uk uñjkti.
He was a very	Jupajj wali .
I understood that perfectly.	Nayajj uk sum amuyayäta.
That doesn’t appeal to me.	Ukax janiw nayatakix wali askïkiti.
I think you are welcome.	Nayax amuyta, jumanakax wali askiwa.
He started drinking again.	Jupax wasitat umañ qalltäna.
I’ve always wanted to say that.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukham sañ munta.
And there’s really nothing to do here.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kunas akan lurañax utjkiti.
But he knew he didn't.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I saw that thing today.	Jichhürunakanxa uka kunsa uñjta.
And he’s a bad guy.	Ukat jupax jan wali jaqiwa.
I’ve actually seen it.	Chiqpachansa uñjta.
So I don't see anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns uñjkti.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupax lurawayi.
I know that’s it.	Nayax uk yattwa.
She thought he wanted to go with her.	Jupampiw sarañ muni sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I don't like it.	Nayajj janiw gustkituti.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit parlañ munkti.
I feel so much better now.	Jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.

He was always willing to help.	Jupajj sapa kutiw yanaptʼañ munäna.

Now, it's better.	Jichhax, juk'amp askiwa.
He’s a better person.	Jupax juk’amp suma jaqiwa.
Or pretty so and so.	Jan ukax wali suma ukham ukat ukham.
But he never said that to anyone.	Ukampis janipuniw khitirus ukham siskänti.

But you definitely think of me first.	Ukampis jumajj nayarojj cheqapuniw nayraqat amuyta.
That is not the case today.	Jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkiti.

I’m doing pretty good.	Nayax wali sum luraskta.

He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
And the longer the better.	Ukat jukʼamp tiempojj jukʼamp askiwa.

You’re a good guy, actually.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa, chiqpachansa.

I've never seen it.	Janipuniw uñjkti.
I said that’s good enough.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa sasaw sista.
I don't believe in that.	Nayajj janiw ukar creykti.

And he has to do it again.	Ukat wasitatwa lurañapa.
This is a great guy.	Akax mä jach’a jaqiwa.
He saw what that would do.	Kunsa ukajj lurani uk uñjäna.

That was it for me today.	Jichhürojj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.

I don’t know that.	Janiw uk yatkti.
There’s both.	Ukax panpachaniw utji.
That's what he did.	Ukhamwa jupajj luräna.
That didn't work.	Ukajj janiw lurkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He had no idea where he was.	Jupajj kawkhans jikjjatasi uk janiw amuykänti.
Well maybe not.	Suma inas jan wali.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
He really wants to talk to you.	Chiqpachansa jumamp parltʼañ muni.
He didn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns yatkänti.

That’s never a good thing.	Ukax janipuniw askïkiti.

He doesn't understand it well.	Jupajj janiw sum amuykiti.
No, not really.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa.
He doesn’t exist not now.	Jupax janiw utjkiti janiw jichhax utjkiti.
This happened three times.	Ukajj kimsa kutiw pasäna.
Well, it really is.	Ukhamawa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
Almost no one noticed.	Niya janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kuna jan walinak lurañas utjkiti.

He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
Today, that is not the case.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t know what happened to me.	Janiw yatkti kunas nayamp pasäna.
He’s doing it all alone.	Jupax sapakiw taqi ukanak luraski.
This, in my opinion, is just as bad.	Akax, nayatakix ukhamarakiw jan wali.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He didn't really have a choice.	Jupajj janiw cheqapunit kuna lurañas utjkänti.

But it’s not very effective.	Ukampis janiw sinti askïkiti.

He is doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraski.
But it is worth the effort.	Ukampis uka lurañajj wali askiwa.

He really wants to talk about me.	Chiqpachansa nayat parlañ muni.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.

He is the one, the only one.	Jupaw ukax, mä sapakiw.

He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
This happened, and that.	Akax pasäna, ukat ukax.

I’m still thinking about it.	Nayax wali amuyta.
I want to buy a new house.	Machaq uta alañ munta.
That’s good enough for now.	Ukax jichhax wali askiwa.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luräna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I didn't understand him.	Nayajj janiw jupar amuykayätti.
But he’s a nice guy.	Ukampis jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
There’s very little light there.	Ukanx wali juk’a qhanaw utji.

He couldn't do it.	Jupajj janiw puedkänti.
He worked really hard at it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet wal chʼamachasïna.

He couldn't say it.	Jupajj janiw uk sañ puedkänti.
You know that, you know.	Jumax uk yatisktawa.
Never did that, myself.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, naya pachpa.

He was constantly making them better.	Sapa kutiw jupanakar jukʼamp sum luraskäna.

He began to eat with great enthusiasm.	Jupax wali kusisitaw manq’añ qalltäna.
To be honest, he really never did.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
I can see how excited he is.	Kunjamsa jupajj kusisit jikjjatasi uk sum uñjta.
He loves me, but he doesn't know it.	Jupajj nayaruw munasi, ukampis janiw uk yatkiti.
I want to go somewhere.	Nayax kawkirus sarañ munta.
But it is not available now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj utjkiti.
I don't agree at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa iyaw siskti.
He said he didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkti sasaw säna.
That’s nobody, of course.	Ukax janiw khitis ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
It happened to me recently.	Jichhakiw nayarojj ukham pasäna.
You had no choice.	Jumax janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
I never understood it.	Janipuniw amuykayätti.
There is a real sense of urgency.	Chiqpachansa, jankʼakiw lurañax utji.
There is not much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
Almost every day.	Niya sapa uru.
That’s what it means now.	Ukax jichhax sañ muni.
Tom didn't know what to do right now.	Tom jilatajj janiw jichhajj kun lurañsa amuyaskänti.
I don't want to talk about it any more.	Janiw jukʼamp uka toqet parlañ munkti.
He decided to go anyway, alone.	Jupax kunjamatsa sarañ amtäna, sapaki.
He’s a human being.	Jupax jaqiwa.
Now there are two.	Jichhax pä.
He couldn't talk to us.	Jupajj janiw nanakamp parlañ puedkänti.
He wasn't sure why.	Jupajj kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
Then he started again.	Ukat wasitatwa qalltäna.
He says he can do anything.	Kunsa luraspa sasaw saraki.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
He knew what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
But they are not necessary.	Ukampis janiw jupanakajj wakiskiti.
And, so it goes.	Ukat, ukhamaw saraski.
But that might backfire on him.	Ukampis ukajj inas jupar jan walinak luraspa.
Almost, at least.	Niya, mä juk’a.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
The snow is called.	Ukax satawa.
It happened too fast.	Sinti jank’akiw pasäna.
But, somehow he did.	Ukampis, kunjamatsa ukham luräna.
It doesn’t matter to me.	Nayatakix janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He needed time to do what he needed to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk lurañatakiw tiempo munäna.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But that’s good for you.	Ukampis ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That’s immature, maybe.	Ukax jan jilïr jaqiwa, inas.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
And no, not everything.	Ukat janiw, janiw taqi kunas utjkiti.
This is not necessary .	Ukax janiw wakiskiti .
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
I have a lot of doubts.	Nayax walpun pächasta.
But it wasn't what he did.	Ukampis janiw kuntï jupajj lurkäna ukhamäkänti.
The ?.	Ukax ?.
He understood what had happened.	Jupajj kunas pasäna uk sum amuyäna.
He didn't know if that was enough.	Ukajj wakisispati janicha uk janiw yatkänti.
Or maybe he should.	Jan ukajj inas jupajj ukham lurañapa.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
He wanted to do it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk lurañ munäna.
Nice and soft.	Suma ukat llamp’u.
Always is, always will be.	Sapa kutiw utji, sapa kutiw utjani.
I didn't think so.	Nayajj janiw ukham amuykayätti.
Today, that is not the case.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know you mean well, but .	Nayax yattwa jumax sum sañ munta, ukampis .
But this, he thought.	Ukampis aka, sasaw amuyäna.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I really liked that.	Chiqpachansa ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Mary did this every other day.	Mariax sapa pä uruw ukham luratayna.
Or a book.	Jan ukajj mä libro.
But this isn’t the case, not really.	Ukampis akax janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
I didn’t know how to do this.	Janiw nayax uk lurañ yatkayätti.
No one knows better than you.	Janiw khitis jumat sipan jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
He doesn’t know how.	Jupax janiw kunjamsa uk yatkiti.
He understood it fairly well.	Jupajj mä jukʼa sumwa uk sum amuyäna.
No one seems to have it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqitxa utjkaspati.
This is clearly found here.	Ukajj qhanaw akan jikjjatasi.
He meant well.	Jupajj sum sañ munäna.
No, it wasn’t anyone.	Janiwa, khitis ukhamänwa.
I don't want him to do that for me.	Janiw nayatakejj ukham lurañap munkti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
I never saw them again.	Janipuniw mayampsa jupanakar uñjkti.
Now I understand.	Jichhax amuyasta.
He was able to see it through.	Jupajj uk sum uñjäna.
That’s the reason.	Ukaw kunatsa.
Really, somehow.	Chiqpachansa, kunjamatsa.
Now he was doing that.	Jichhajj ukham luraskäna.
Sure enough, you know.	Chiqpachansa, jumax yatisktawa.
It felt just as good.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw wali sum jikjjatasïna.
That’s the reason.	Ukax kunatsa.
But that was the case.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamänwa.
He’s still in pain.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
Today, he is even more depressed.	Jichhürunakanjja, jukʼamp llakitaw jikjjatasi.
It wasn't like that before.	Nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He knew all about it.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sum yatïna.
I don’t think so.	Nayax janiw ukham amuyta.
He didn't know how he understood it.	Kunjamsa uk amuyäna uk janiw yatkänti.
And now, that’s good for you.	Ukat jichhax, ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
To be honest, I see both.	Chiqpachansa, panpachaniw ukham uñjta.
He never needs to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
Not as .	Janiw kunjamtï .
So again, again.	Ukhamajj wasitatwa.
He was always doing something.	Jupax sapa kutiw kuns luraskäna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
But he did it himself.	Ukampis jupaw ukham luräna.
But it wasn't necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
That's what he told me.	Ukaw jupajj sitäna.
He did an amazing job.	Jupajj wali muspharkañ luräna.
She was glad to see him there.	Ukan jupar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Very large.	Sinti jach’a.
He has done it all before.	Jupaw nayrajj taqe ukanak lurawayi.
I really think so.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukham amuyta.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
But he never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
This happened twice.	Ukajj pä kutiw pasäna.
It will be a long time.	Ukajj wali jaya tiempow pasani.
Do you really think that is possible.	¿Chiqapunit ukham lurañax wakisispa sasin amuyta.
That doesn't mean it doesn't.	Ukajj janiw sañ munkiti, janiw uk sañ munkiti.
It is not necessary anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp wakiskiti.
In fact, it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
But that’s what I like.	Ukampis ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I am not sure about that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
I don't need it.	Janiw nayajj wakiskiti.
I don't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
I’ve seen it.	Nayax uk uñjta.
You don't need that time.	Janiw uka tiempojj wakiskiti.
I am not sure how he feels about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunjamsa jikxatasi uk janiw sum yatkti.
You can’t do it tomorrow.	Qhipürux janiw lurañjamäkiti.
Very large.	Walja jach’a.
On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
That is what we need to do today.	Jichhürunakanx ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He left immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
But nothing isn’t good enough.	Ukampis janiw kunas jan askïkiti.
It just happened to be.	Ukhamakiw pasäna.
So it's very recent.	Ukhamajj wali jichhakiw utji.
I know that’s it.	Nayax uk yattwa.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
I prefer this one.	Nayax akax juk’amp askiwa.
I won’t do it again.	Janiw mayampsa lurkäti.
How to .	Kunjamsa .
That’s what it’s about, really.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
He already knew that.	Ukhamwa jupajj nayratpach yatïna.
It didn't exist.	Janiw ukajj utjkänti.
No one understood.	Janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Don't know what's going on.	Janiw yatkiti kunas utji.
He wasn’t like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
The next day it wasn’t.	Qhipürux janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want to use it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak apnaqañ munkänti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He didn't want to talk to her immediately.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak jupamp parlañ munkänti.
But he didn't understand it.	Ukampis janiw uk amuykänti.
He knew what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
It was a great day.	Mä jach’a uru ukhamänwa.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sum yatta.
Didn’t really need to do that.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
Where is all this money going?.	¿Kawkirus taqi aka qullqix saraski?.
He did what he did well.	Jupajj kuntï lurkäna uk sumwa luräna.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He said he wouldn't.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkäti sasaw säna.
I don't think so now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham amuykti.
I saw it today.	Jichhüruw uñjta.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I've done my best.	Nayax taqi ch'amampiw lurawayta.
There was nothing there.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkänti.
You’re the one who thinks so.	Jumax ukham amuyta.
I’m in love with them.	Nayax munasiñampiw jupanakar uñjta.
Therefore, it is necessary to do bad things.	Ukatwa jan walinak lurañax wakisi.
I know you guys don't like me.	Nayajj yattwa, jumanakajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
It really wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
The guy knew that.	Uka waynax uk yatïna.
But there was never anything like that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham kunas utjkänti.
I don’t know what to do.	Nayax janiw yatkti.
You are welcome.	Janiw kunatsa.
But there was nothing like that.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukham utjkänti.
I don't know any more.	Janiw jukʼamp yatkti.
And that’s what it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamawa.
But I can't remember where.	Ukampis kawkhansa uk janiw amtaskti.
And then again the next day.	Ukat ukat qhipürux wasitatwa.

No one said anything.	Janiw khitis siskänti.

No, it’s a long way.	Janiwa, wali jaya.
There was never anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham utjkänti.
I didn’t know how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw yatkayätti.
But I didn’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkti.
A little too good.	Mä juk’a sinti suma.

I know that's a good thing.	Nayajj uk sum yatta.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I wonder how long it will last.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj utjani sasaw jisktʼasta.
Or, nothing at all.	Jan ukax, janiw kunas utjkiti.

But he seemed nice.	Ukampis jupajj suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
It was now or never.	Jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
He wanted her yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw jupar munäna.
By now it was pretty obvious.	Jichhakamax wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
No, no, no, no, no.	Janiwa janiwa janiwa janiwa janiwa.
He politely refused.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw jan munkänti.
It took longer to realize.	Ukajj jukʼamp jaya tiempow amuyasïna.
I didn’t really mean it.	Janiw cheqpachapun uk sañ munkayätti.
He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
That’s exactly what it’s about.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I understood what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna uk sum amuyayäta.
I don’t think that’s good enough.	Ukax janiw askïkiti sasaw amuyasta.
It should do what you want it to do.	Ukaw kuntï munkta uk lurañapa.

I wanted to know about it before.	Nayax nayrax uka tuqit yatiñ munta.
But it never happens.	Ukampis janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
He knows that is not the case.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti uk sum yati.
He doesn't always like it.	Jupajj janiw sapa kuti ukham gustkiti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He was alone in the house.	Jupajj sapakiw uka utan jikjjatasïna.
But I definitely need to do it.	Ukampis nayax chiqpachapuniw ukanak lurañax wakisi.

He was quite happy for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

So that's a good thing.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali askiwa.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
You have to make yourself feel bad.	Juma pachpaw jan walinak lurasajj jan walinak lurañama.

It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
And I have always done that.	Ukat nayratpachaw ukham lurawayta.
He wanted it very much.	Jupajj walpun uk munäna.
And that doesn’t really matter.	Ukat ukax janiw chiqpachansa wakiskiti.

He told me that.	Jupajj ukham sitäna.

That’s what did it.	Ukaw ukham luräna.
I don't care who did it.	Khitis uk luräna uk janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkti.
That was not needed now.	Ukajj janiw jichhajj wakiskänti.
Almost no one was there, ever.	Niya janiw khitis ukan utjkänti, janipuniw.
I have no idea what that meant.	Kuntï ukajj sañ munkäna uk janiw amuykti.
But it often feels like it.	Ukampis walja kutiw ukham amuyasi.
But nobody wanted them.	Ukampis janiw khitis jupanakar munkänti.

You can’t do what you want.	Janiw kuntï munkta uk lurañjamäkiti.

Now the day has arrived.	Jichhajj uruw purini.
I didn’t tell him anything.	Janiw nayax jupar kuns siskti.
He doesn't want to talk to anyone.	Janiw khitimpis parlañ munkiti.

In fact, he is.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamawa.
I don't know exactly.	Nayajj janiw sum yatkti.

And he did it again himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw wasitat luräna.

He is the only one.	Jupa sapakiw utji.

But it is worth doing.	Ukampis lurañajj wali askiwa.
He knew nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkänti.

It can’t be that way.	Janiw ukham utjkaspati.

He’s still in bed.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw ikiñan jikxatasi.
And that’s not the case.	Ukat ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to spend the night with her.	Jupampiw uka arumax qhiparañ munäna.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
He didn't want them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar munkänti.

But it is not the .	Ukampis janiw uka .

So he was like that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
He’s doing very well.	Jupax wali sum luraski.
Well this is it.	Suma akax ukhamawa.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

I want to stay here for the night.	Nayax akan arumax qhiparañ munta.
And that was obvious.	Ukat ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
But otherwise he was.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa jupax ukhamänwa.
He doesn't want one.	Jupajj janiw mä jukʼa munkiti.

No one did that to him.	Janiw khitis jupar ukham lurkänti.
That was nothing to do.	Ukajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It wasn't like that for so long.	Ukham jaya tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He was the one who was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa.
But he took the drive.	Ukampis jupaw uka auto apnaqañ qalltäna.

You know you have to.	Jumax yatisktawa ukham lurañama.

But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
This is a very interesting one.	Akax wali askiwa.

He saw again how much she longed for him.	Jupajj kunjamsa jupajj wal munäna uk wasitatwa uñjäna.

He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
And I think he feels the same way.	Ukat jupax ukhamarakiw jikxatasi sasaw amuyta.
Great great sum.	Jach’a jach’a suma.
It wasn’t like that .	Janiw ukhamäkänti .
Then he started doing it a bit.	Ukat mä jukʼa lurañ qalltäna.
But fortunately, it’s not good anywhere.	Ukampis wali askiwa, janiw kawkirus askïkiti.
It started the day before.	Ukajj nayrïr uruw qalltäna.
But I don’t know what to do.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañsa yatkti.
I don’t want to believe it.	Nayax janiw iyaw sañ munkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s what he did.	Ukaw jupajj luräna.
I want to know what he has to say.	Kuntï jupajj siski uk yatiñ munta.
Well that’s good enough.	Suma ukax wali askiwa.
He’s at it again.	Jupax wasitatwa ukan jikxatasi.
He knew a lot about it.	Jupajj walpun yatïna.
That’s not good for you.	Ukax janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
I don’t know of anything that would do that, nowadays.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañapatak yatkti, jichhürunakanxa.
He already knew.	Jupax nayratpach yatïna.
He didn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykänti.
There’s nothing there for me.	Janiw kunas ukan nayatakix utjkiti.
And he didn't know why.	Ukat kunatsa uk janiw yatkänti.
You are such a beautiful person.	Jumax ukham suma jaqiwa.
He didn't refuse.	Jupajj janiw jan iyaw siskänti.
Now I want to do something else.	Jichhax yaqha lurañ munta.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That started it all.	Ukaw taqi ukanak qalltäna.
But there was none, of course.	Ukampis janiw khitis utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
I am so glad to see you.	Nayajj jumar uñjasajj wal kusista.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk lurañama.
It was, he thought.	Ukhamänwa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Today, that is not the case.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I hope to do so.	Ukham lurañatakiw suytʼaskta.
No, this was the case.	Janiwa, akax ukhamänwa.
It meant only one thing.	Ukajj mä sapak sañ munäna.
He knows exactly what he wants.	Jupajj kuntï munki uk sum yati.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
No, he realized.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj amuyasïna.
What do you think?.	¿Kunsa jumax amuyta?.
It is not necessary anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp wakiskiti.
And therefore.	Ukat ukatwa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
He couldn't do anything about it.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
¡There is nothing!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti!.
he said, smirking.	sasaw säna.
But no one knows that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk yatkiti.
I’ve done it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukanak lurawayta.
I certainly won’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkäti.
So maybe .	Ukhamajj inas .
You have no choice.	Jumax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
But he knew better.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
No one knew what it was.	Janiw khitis kunas uk yatkänti.
I’m not going to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkäti.
And you can’t do that.	Ukat janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
This is not a .	Ukajj janiw mä .
This was not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
This, of course, is not necessary.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, janiw wakiskiti.
No, I don't do that.	Janiwa, janiw nayajj ukham lurkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want more .	Nayax juk'amp munta .
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
So he did it.	Ukatwa uk luräna.
And it’s not the right thing to do.	Ukat janiw ukax askïkiti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
This was a rather strange feeling.	Ukajj mä jukʼa muspharkañ jikjjatasïna.
Make yourself some coffee.	Juma pachpaw mä juk’a café lurañama.
I didn’t think so.	Janiw ukham amuykayätti.
They are very likable.	Jupanakajj wal gusti.
But there is a less serious way to do it.	Ukampis jan sinti jan walinak lurañaw utji.
This is believed not to be the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He knew exactly where and when.	Kawkhansa ukat kunapachas uk sum yatïna.
He didn't want them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar munkänti.
I understand what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk sum amuyta.

Everything was like that.	Taqi kunas ukhamänwa.
It couldn’t be a higher price.	Janiw juk’amp jach’a qullqix utjkaspati.
But there’s nothing there.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
I can't say any more.	Janiw jukʼamp sañjamäkiti.
He is a very happy person.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
We have nothing to do with it.	Jiwasax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I don’t see that.	Nayax janiw uk uñjkti.
He longed to see her.	Jupajj jupar uñjañ wal munäna.

I think you know that about me.	Nayax amuyta, jumax nayat uk yatisktawa.
It is agreed upon.	Ukax iyaw satawa.
I would never do it again, ever.	Nayax janipuniw mayamps uk lurañ munkti, janipuniw.

He’s very excited.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I agree with that.	Nayax ukax iyaw satawa.
I just saw it.	Jichhakiw uñjta.
But it didn't have to be that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
He had just decided.	Jupajj jichhakiw uk amtäna.
He wants to learn.	Yatiqañ muni.
Nothing else made sense.	Janiw kunas yaqha tuqitxa amuyaskänti.
He knew what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
But now it was a long time or needed.	Ukampis jichhajj walja tiempow jan ukajj wakiskänti.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
So he worked hard.	Ukatwa jupajj wal chʼamachasïna.
Beyond that, he couldn't tell what was going to happen.	Ukat sipansa, janiw kunas pasani uk yatiñ puedkänti.
And he did it himself.	Ukat jupaw uk luräna.
This was obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
That or any kind.	Uka jan ukax kuna kasta.
Or somehow he thought so.	Jan ukajj kunjamatsa ukham amuyäna.
I definitely have.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw utjitu.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
There is a lot of value in doing this.	Uk lurañajj wali askiwa.
I can't say any more.	Janiw jukʼamp siskti.
So much the better, anyhow.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa, kunjamatsa.
I just didn't want to know any more.	Nayajj janiw jukʼamp yatiñ munkayätti.
But he knew he would.	Ukampis ukham lurani uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I don't think so.	Nayajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I mean really big.	Chiqpachansa jach’a sañ munta.
Truly an amazing person.	Chiqpachansa mä muspharkañ jaqiwa.
You don’t need to do that.	Jumax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
It wasn’t.	Ukhamänwa.
He said he wouldn't.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkäti sasaw säna.
I want to do it again.	Nayax wasitat lurañ munta.
This is a new yard.	Akax mä machaq yati.
That’s all .	Ukax taqpach .
I really didn’t understand anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns amuykayätti.
He was the one who started it.	Jupaw uk qalltäna.
But, there was nothing.	Ukampis, janiw kunas utjkänti.
That’s a good thing for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
I don't understand it well.	Janiw sum amuykti.
I am, of course, sorry about that.	Nayax, chiqpachansa, ukat llakistwa.
You can’t do that, of course.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
He didn't know anything.	Janiw kunas uk yatkänti.
I understand that perfectly.	Nayax uk sum amuyta.
Very nice, very nice.	Wali suma, wali suma.
I didn’t know he could do that.	Ukham luraspa uk janiw yatkayätti.
I really want to know what that feels like.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk wal yatiñ munta.
I saw it today.	Jichhüruw uñjta.
Nothing he already knows.	Janiw kunas jupax nayratpach yatkiti.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
He wants to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa muni.
He was obviously devastated.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Today, however, that is not the case.	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I really want to do all of this.	Taqe ukanak lurañ walpun munta.
I can’t believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
But it can’t be without it.	Ukampis janiw jan utjkaspati.
I never did, actually.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, chiqpachansa.
I’m so happy for you.	Nayax jumatakix walpun kusista.
And it’s .	Ukat ukax .
But he has nothing to do here.	Ukampis jupax janiw kuna lurañas akan utjkiti.
I just feel like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw jikxatastxa.
He wanted to talk to her.	Jupamp parltʼañ wal munäna.
Do this three times.	Kimsa kutiw ukham lurañama.
But that doesn't mean it didn't exist.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jan utjkänti sañ munkiti.
This should be done immediately.	Ukax jank’akiw lurañapa.
Or it just felt that way.	Jan ukajj ukhamakiw jikjjatasïna.
But that is rare.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti utjkiti.
It’s a great day.	Mä jach’a uru.
It’s almost certainly the other way around.	Niya chiqpachapuniw yaqha tuqitxa.
A guy soon he is.	Mä waynax jank’akiw jupax.
I just feel like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw jikxatastxa.
I did the same yesterday.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw qharürojj lurawayta.
I don't have them in me.	Nayajj janiw jupanakajj nayan utjkituti.
He had seen it recently.	Jupajj jichhakiw uk uñjäna.
It felt pretty much the same.	Ukajj niya ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
And that is exactly what happened.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamarakiw pasäna.
It doesn’t exist here.	Janiw akax utjkiti.
What? 	Kuna?
I won't do that tomorrow.	Qharürojj janiw uk lurkäti.
It went away quickly.	Ukajj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
Also, .	Ukhamaraki, .
There can be no more time now.	Jichhajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkaspati.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
He seemed to be someone else.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak munkänti.
Another amazing day.	Yaqha muspharkañ uru.
It felt really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa amuyasïna.
I had no idea who it might be.	Khitis ukajj inas uk janiw yatkayätti.
It’s a great book.	Mä jach’a libro.
I’m so sorry for the inconvenience.	Nayax wali llakistwa.
I didn't do anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurkti.
It feels like that every day.	Sapa uruw ukham amuyasi.
And that's a good thing.	Ukat ukajj wali askiwa.
He took good care of her.	Jupaw jupar sum uñjäna.
That meant something.	Ukax kuns sañ munäna.
It is almost	Ukajj niya .
I didn't understand them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakar amuyirïkti.
There was nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkänti.
And he didn't say anything.	Ukat janiw kuns siskänti.
Something is doing this.	Kunas ukham luraski.
I didn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkti.
No one understands this.	Janiw khitis uk amuykiti.
He is not as .	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï .
It really felt that way.	Chiqpachansa ukhamwa amuyasïna.
We are a .	Jiwasax mä .
He didn't want to do that.	Janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
There is nothing to say.	Janiw kunas sañjamäkiti.
He’s a really nice guy.	Chiqpachansa mä suma jaqiwa.
That’s how it feels.	Ukax kunjams jikxatasi.
I'm not sure.	Nayax yattwa.
I already understand how it feels.	Nayax nayratpach kunjams jikxatasi uk amuyta.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
He was a little worried.	Jupajj mä jukʼa llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
You don't have to	Janiw jumax .
I'm not sure.	Nayax yattwa.
But it was still worth it.	Ukampis wali askiwa.
So he asked for what he wanted.	Ukatwa kuntï munkäna uk mayïna.
You really can’t do anything wrong.	Chiqpachansa janiw jan walinak lurañjamäkiti.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
I wonder where he went.	Kawkirus saräna sasaw jisktʼasta.
That, well .	Ukax, wali .
So much the better.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa.
I want to do something about it.	Nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munta.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.
Which you absolutely must.	Ukax jumax chiqpachapuniw lurañama.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
I know he can do that.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luraspa.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I’m doing it.	Nayax uk luraskta.
I said why not.	Nayax kunatsa jan ukhamäki sasaw sista.
This is him now.	Akax jupaw jichhax.
I wonder how he knew.	Kunjamsa jupajj yatïna sasaw jisktʼasta.
You can do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk lurasma.
It needs to be done in the middle of the day.	Chika urux lurañaw wakisi.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
I really don’t know how.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.
It’s not entirely like that.	Janiw taqpach ukhamäkiti.
I just think so.	Nayax ukhamakiw amuyta.
And really, that’s good.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa.
This was obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Much bigger than me.	Nayat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa.
Therefore, this feature can be avoided.	Ukatwa, uka lurañax jan utjkaspati.
He had done it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uk luratayna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He saw it somehow.	Jupax kunjamatsa uñjäna.
I asked him once.	Nayax mä kutiw jupar jiskt’asta.
Now he could see it very clearly.	Jichhajj wali sumwa uñjäna.
Whatever you want, whatever.	Kuntix munkta, kuna.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
And he didn't know anything.	Ukat janiw kuns yatkänti.
So there was no other option.	Ukhamajj janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
That’s totally fine.	Ukax taqpach wali askiwa.
It really feels that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham jikxatasi.
And so he was.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
It was very obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
Very soon of course.	Wali jank’akiw chiqpachansa.
You know, he did that.	Jumax yatisktawa, jupax ukham luratayna.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I think it’s worth it.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali askiwa.
Everything is already .	Taqi kunas niya .
He did nothing to make it happen.	Jupajj janiw kuns ukham lurañatakejj lurkänti.
But it really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s still in pain.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.
He said he wanted me.	Jupajj nayaruw munta sasaw säna.
Alone, always alone.	Sapaki, sapa kuti sapaki.
He was right about that.	Jupajj uka toqet cheqapuniw säna.
He told me that once, long ago.	Jupax mä kutiw ukham sitäna, nayratpachaw.
That means a lot.	Ukax walja sañ muni.
That’s good, of course.	Ukax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
But I just don’t know how to go about it.	Ukampis nayax janiw kunjams uka tuqit sarañax uk yatkti.
He asked you to.	Jupaw jumanakar mayïna.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
But now I am happy.	Ukampis jichhajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
It doesn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
But, it’s not like that.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Large and spacious.	Jach’a ukat jach’a.
He wanted to do these things.	Jupajj ukanak lurañwa munäna.
I haven’t said it yet.	Janiw jichhakamax siskti.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s what it’s supposed to do.	Ukaw uka lurañapa.
He had nothing to do.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He was somewhere.	Jupajj kawkhansa jikjjatasïna.

That’s the thing.	Ukax ukhamawa.
And he took care of it.	Ukat jupajj uk sum uñjäna.
So he tried not to do that.	Ukatwa jan ukham lurañatak chʼamachasïna.
Still a bit of coffee.	Wali mä juk’a café ukaw utji.

He knew nothing about the country.	Jupax uka markat janiw kuns yatkänti.

It certainly was for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix ukhamänwa.
He didn’t mean that, of course.	Jupax janiw ukham sañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
That didn't mean he would.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurani sañ munkänti.
You’re right about it.	Jumax sum amuyta.

He’s a human being.	Jupax jaqiwa.
That’s not the case at all.	Ukax janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uñjäna.

Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
And this, of course, is how it feels.	Ukat akax, chiqpachansa, kunjams jikxatasi.
They are not worth it.	Jupanakax janiw askïkiti.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurkänti.
He didn't quite understand why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum amuykänti.

I’m really sorry.	Chiqpachansa nayax llakistwa.

I’m sorry, but there was nothing to it.	Nayax llakistwa, ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqitx utjkänti.

There was nothing wrong with it.	Janiw kuna jan wali lurañas utjkänti.

That doesn't mean that, he said.	Ukajj janiw ukajj sañ munkiti, sasaw jupajj säna.

But that is not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And there was nothing to do.	Ukat janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.

Maybe it’s worth doing.	Inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
For a long time, there was not much time.	Walja tiempojj janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
The guy is nobody.	Uka waynax janiw khitis utjkiti.
There is no way to do that.	Ukham lurañax janiw utjkiti.

There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
¡There is nothing!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti!.

He was just being mean.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jan walinak luraskäna.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
But often nothing is possible.	Ukampis walja kutiw janiw kunas utjkaspati.
He immediately began to act.	Ukat jankʼakiw kuns lurañ qalltäna.

But there was nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkänti.

You’re saying that.	Jumax ukham sista.

He chose not to do so.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ amtäna.
He told me the truth.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sitäna.
But I think there is something to that.	Ukampis ukajj kunas utji sasaw amuyta.
Or rather, he did it better.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna.

And now he’s alone.	Ukat jichhax sapakiw jikxatasi.

That's a good thing for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
Great, that’s good.	Jach’a, ukax wali askiwa.

It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He told me what it was.	Jupaw kunas uk sitäna.
To be honest, he was a little disappointed.	Chiqpachansa, jupax mä jukʼa llakitaw jikxatasïna.

Well, he did that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukham luräna.

He decided to go home alone in great distress.	Ukat wali llakitaw sapaki utar sarañ amtäna.
He doesn't like me.	Jupajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
A bad kind of that.	Mä jan wali kasta uka.
He is a stupid guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqewa.
I’m still feeling it.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw jikxatastxa.
But that is a long way off.	Ukampis ukajj wali jaya tiempow pasaski.

For one thing, he was excited.	Mä tuqitxa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.

It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
But not much can be done about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet wal lurañjamäkiti.
Or rather, he did it better.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna.

There was nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkänti.
That was not what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw jupajj munkänti.

I’m a little skeptical.	Nayax mä juk’a pächasta.

He thought he was a bad guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.

And he didn’t want to go.	Ukat jupax janiw sarañ munkänti.

Or with him.	Jan ukajj jupamp chika.

I don’t think so.	Nayatakix janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it doesn't work for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.

But that is rare.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti utjkiti.
There is no such thing.	Ukajj janiw utjkiti.
I want to see that.	Nayax uk uñjañ munta.
Earlier some money.	Nayraqat mä jukʼa qollqe.

That's what he bought.	Ukaw jupajj alasïna.
He wanted no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp munkänti.
Only one would suffice.	Mä sapakiw wakisispa.
He was a very successful man.	Jupajj wali sumwa sarnaqäna.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp parlañ munkänti.
Too much money, actually.	Sinti qullqi, chiqpachansa.

He wasn't that bad about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet ukham jan walinak lurkänti.
He did it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk luräna.

Nothing, right now, no one.	Janiw kunas, jichhax, janiw khitis utjkiti.

There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.

And he felt the same way.	Ukat jupax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïna.

I didn’t know how to control him.	Janiw kunjamsa jupar apnaqañ yatkayätti.

And he did it well.	Ukat uk sumwa luräna.

But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
I’ll do it again.	Wasitat lurani.
He could not attend.	Jupajj janiw ukar sarañ puedkänti.

Not that he isn't.	Janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.

No, he said to himself.	Janiwa, sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
Where is he going?	Kawkirus saraski.
That is how he felt now.	Ukhamaw jichhajj jikjjatasïna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I knew he would.	Ukham lurani uk sum yatiyäta.
A great house.	Mä jach’a uta.

He seemed to be human.	Jupajj jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
So he told her to.	Ukatwa jupar säna.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
I'm not saying that.	Nayajj janiw uk siskti.

That's what he said.	Ukaw jupajj säna.
Why, he didn't know.	Kunatsa, janiw yatkänti.
I don’t want anything to do with him.	Janiw jupamp kuns lurañ munkti.
He left early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwat sarjjäna.
No one knew what had happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
So I didn't know how much longer.	Ukhamajj qhawqha tiempos jukʼamp utjani uk janiw yatkayätti.

Now he knew that was not the case.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkänti uk sum yatïna.
But that he had no idea.	Ukampis ukajj jupajj janiw kuns amuykänti.

He wanted to talk to her.	Jupampiw parltʼañ munäna.
I mean really, really good.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa sañ munta.
That's what happened.	Ukaw pasani.
I didn't do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurkti.

He’s doing it.	Jupax uk luraski.
That was for some reason.	Ukajj mä kunatsa ukhamänwa.
It does exactly what you want it to do.	Kuntï munkta uk sumwa luraski.
He’s a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
I’m sorry but still.	Nayax llakistwa ukampis ukhamakiw.

Very, very sad feeling.	Wali, wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
It doesn’t make any sense.	Janiw kuns amuykiti.
I don’t want to see him.	Janiw jupar uñjañ munkti.
This is obviously not the case.	Ukax qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
I think he just felt that way.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukhamakiw jikxatasïna.
I’m asking why.	Nayax kunatsa uk jiskt’asta.
And that’s exactly what happened.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.

This is urgently needed.	Ukajj jankʼakiw wakisi.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

He’s all alone.	Jupax taqpach sapakiw jikxatasi.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
Everyone except me.	Taqinipuniw jan ukax nayat sipansa.
That is not the case today.	Jichhürunakanjja janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never did that.	Janipuniw uk lurkti.
I just don't like him.	Nayajj janiw jupar gustkituti.

He is doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraski.
He knew what it was.	Jupajj kunas ukajj uk sum yatïna.
That's what he told her.	Ukhamwa sasaw jupar säna.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Janiw kunas pasani uk yatkti.
He was very lonely.	Jupajj wali sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
He doesn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkiti.
He was well aware of this.	Jupajj uka toqet sumwa yatïna.
Clearly, he did not.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi, janiw ukham lurkänti.
So there is nothing!.	Ukhamajj ¡janiw kunas utjkiti!.
There was nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkänti.
He decided not to.	Jupajj janiw sasaw amtäna.
You’re welcome.	Jumax wali askiwa.
He couldn't tell the truth.	Jupajj janiw cheq parlañ puedkänti.
That's why it happened.	Ukatwa ukajj pasäna.
I know what you are saying.	Kuntï jumajj siskta uk nayajj yattwa.
He’s a nice guy, he’s a nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, wali suma jaqiwa.
You should do the same.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw lurañama.
But no one understood it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk amuykänti.
They don't need to do that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I’m kind of thinking.	Nayax mä juk’a amuyta.
We’ve had a lot of trouble.	Jiwasax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He again said he could not remember.	Jupajj wasitatwa janiw amtaskti sasaw säna.
So far he’s with me.	Jichhakamax jupax nayamp chikaw jikxatasi.
So far at least.	Jichhakamax mä juk’a.
But he couldn't speak.	Ukampis janiw parlañ puedkänti.
You can’t disagree.	Janiw jan iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Nothing was like this now.	Janiw kunas jichhax ukhamäkänti.

I know you mean well.	Nayax yattwa jumax sum sañ munta.
I really want to see them.	Jupanakar uñjañ wal munta.

Therefore .	Ukatwa .

Why not twice.	Kunatsa jan pä kuti.
You have a good .	Jumax mä suma .
It didn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
It wasn’t.	Ukhamänwa.
He did an amazing job.	Jupajj wali muspharkañ luräna.
There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.
The work is absolutely necessary.	Uka lurañajj cheqapuniw wakisi.
I don’t know when it will happen.	Nayax janiw kunapachas uk yatkti.
That’s clearly here.	Ukax qhanaw akan utji.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
But it’s not all that.	Ukampis janiw taqe kunas ukhamäkiti.
Something wasn’t clear.	Kunas janiw sum amuyaskänti.

I really don’t like that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukax nayatakix askïkiti.
That was not the case at the time.	Uka tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
So there was nothing left.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
But he means no more than that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sañ munkiti.
He refused all of that.	Jupajj taqe ukanak janiw munkänti.
But he was still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
So he was like that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
Whoever did it.	Khitis uk luratayna.
Now I know what it is.	Jichhajj kunas uk yattwa.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I don’t want to use it.	Nayax janiw uka apnaqañ munkti.
I might have to do that.	Nayax inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
I really don't think that's the case.	Chiqpachansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
I told them that.	Nayajj jupanakar ukham sista.
But it worked for me.	Ukampis nayatakix wali askiwa.
He’s a bad guy.	Jupax jan wali jaqiwa.
And nobody wanted me.	Ukat janiw khitis nayar munkänti.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
What do you want .	Kunsa jumajj munta .
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It gets harder, of course.	Ukax juk’amp ch’amampiw jikxatasi, chiqpachansa.
Well, he wasn't.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
You really are great on your own.	Chiqpachansa, juma pachpaw wali jachʼa.

You can do it all by yourself.	Jumax taqpach sapakiw lurasma.
I don't need to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I don’t think it’s worth it.	Nayatakix janiw kunas askïkiti.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

You really can’t do that.	Jumax chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.

Something was really happening.	Kunas chiqpachapuniw luraskäna.

We can’t do it, you know.	Jiwasax janiw lurañjamäkiti, jumax yatisktawa.

He thought it was a good idea.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyäna.

He knew this fact.	Jupajj aka cheq yatïna.

But he didn't mean that.	Ukampis janiw uk sañ munkänti.
I never wanted to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañ munkayätti.

Everything feels better now.	Jichhajj taqe kunas wali sumwa jikjjatasi.

But he can do both.	Ukampis panpachaniw luraspa.

That is obvious now.	Ukajj jichhajj qhanaw amuyasi.

And he never wanted that.	Ukat janipuniw ukham munkänti.
But that is not to say.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sañjamäkiti.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
He asked for nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kunsa mayïna.
But there was nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkänti.
That’s how it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax wakisi.
This is not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.

He could not tell her.	Jupajj janiw ukanak yatiyañ puedkänti.
He knew about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yatïna.

Maybe that’s the point.	Inas ukax uka tuqitxa.
He was about to move on.	Jupajj niyaw yaqha cheqar sarañ qalltäna.
He didn't mean it.	Jupajj janiw uk sañ munkänti.

He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
But there is no such thing.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj utjkiti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
I don’t want that.	Nayax janiw uk munkti.
But that is not necessary now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.

He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He needs to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
There’s nothing I can do to them.	Janiw kunas jupanakar lurañax utjkiti.

On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
No one knows what it is.	Janiw khitis kunas uk yatkiti.
Now there was nothing.	Jichhajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
He had done this twice before.	Jupajj nayrajj pä kutiw ukham luratayna.

He decided that was not the case.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amtäna.
He knows he doesn't need it.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti uk sum yati.
He chose not to do so.	Jupajj jan uk lurañwa amtäna.

You tell yourself it doesn’t matter.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti sasaw juma pachpa sista.
I don’t want him.	Janiw jupar munkti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
Then he decided what to do.	Ukat kunsa lurani uk amtäna.
But somehow he said that.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukham säna.
But it is definitely worth the money.	Ukampis chiqpachansa uka qullqix wali askiwa.

For a long time.	Walja tiempo.

And he’s a whole person.	Ukat jupax taqpach jaqiwa.

They are good for me.	Jupanakax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I want to tell you.	Nayax jumanakar yatiyañ munta.
But really, it’s not very good.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, janiw sinti askïkiti.
But another thing was clear.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa qhanaw amuyasïna.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I didn’t know that.	Janiw uk yatkayätti.
I don’t know what to tell them.	Janiw kuns jupanakar yatiyañ yatkti.
I don't quite understand that.	Nayajj janiw uk sum amuykti.
I didn't understand that.	Nayajj janiw uk amuykayätti.
That’s just the way it is.	Ukax ukhamakiw.
He said he knew nothing about the car.	Jupajj janiw uka autot kuns yatkti sasaw säna.
But it felt like that.	Ukampis ukham amuyasïna.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He didn't believe it.	Jupajj janiw uk iyaw siskänti.
There is only one .	Ukax mä sapa .
It’s almost like that.	Niya ukham lurañaw wakisi.
This is not what you want.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamäkiti.
I didn't do anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurkti.
Not that he wasn't.	Janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
This happened many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasäna.
It is not necessary anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp wakiskiti.
No, he is not like that.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it needs to be done properly.	Ukampis sum lurañaw wakisi.
That’s not necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti.
That is impossible to do.	Ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
You know all about it.	Jumax taqi ukanak yatisktawa.
I feel like something is about to happen.	Kunas niyaw pasani sasaw amuyasta.
I want to know everything.	Nayax taqi kun yatiñ munta.
Well they might.	Suma jupanakax inas.
But there was nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
So that was today.	Ukhamajj jichhürunakan ukhamänwa.
He doesn't like me.	Jupajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
I don't want to be alone.	Janiw nayajj munkti.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
But I understood that.	Ukampis nayajj uk sum amuyayäta.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak munkänti.
It’s still time.	Ukax wali pachaw purini.
I always say that, too.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukham sañ munta, ukhamaraki.
It’s always the same thing.	Sapa kutiw pachpa lurañax utji.
He is a very happy person.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
There is only one.	Mä sapakiw utji.
Lots of this and lots of that.	Walja aka ukat walja ukat.
But it will take time.	Ukampis tiempow munasini.
He is a tall man .	Jupajj jachʼa jaqewa .
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was alone when it happened.	Ukajj paskäna ukhajja, sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
There is only one.	Uka sapakiw utji.
What is there for me? 	¿Kunas nayatakix utji?
There's this however.	Ukanx aka ukampis.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
That’s not saying much, really.	Ukax janiw sinti sañ munkiti, chiqpachansa.
He told me the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw nayarojj sitäna.
But he didn't understand that.	Ukampis jupajj uk janiw amuykänti.
I didn’t see it there.	Nayax janiw ukan uñjkti.
There is no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti.
He had done that to her.	Jupajj jupar ukham luratayna.
This happened to me several times.	Ukajj walja kutiw nayar pasäna.
That doesn't make much sense to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw sinti askïkiti.
I don’t want coffee.	Nayax janiw café munkti.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
He’s got to do it.	Jupaw lurañapa.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I just feel sleepy.	Nayax ukhamakiw ikiñan jikxatastxa.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
I really liked that.	Chiqpachansa ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
So much the better.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa.
I’m the same.	Nayax pachpa.
So maybe you should do some.	Ukhamajj inas mä qhawqha lurañama.
You know that, you know.	Jumax uk yatisktawa.
I don’t know what to do here.	Janiw kuns akan lurañ yatkti.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
You always do that.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham lurasma.
I had no idea what had happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
You don't have to do all of that.	Janiw taqe ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
I didn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkti.

You know it and always have.	Jumax uk yatisktawa ukat sapa kutiw ukham yatta.
I really don’t know about that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit yatkti.
He’s in a lot of pain right now.	Jupax jichhax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
Maybe once or twice.	Inas mä kuti jan ukax pä kuti.
He doesn't have anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
You know there is no such thing.	Jumax yatisktawa janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.
We’re both of us.	Panpachaniw jiwasax.
Now he enjoys doing it part-time.	Jichhax jupax chika uru lurañax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I’m happy, I’m very happy.	Nayax kusisitaw jikxatastxa, wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

I really appreciate it.	Nayax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.

Three great days.	Kimsa jach’a uru.
But you are not like that.	Ukampis janiw jumanakajj ukhamäkiti.
I just can’t do it.	Nayax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
And it took longer before that.	Ukat uka nayrajj jukʼamp tiempow pasäna.
He didn't know how to use one.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa mä apnaqañ yatkänti.
No one knows exactly why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
That means he is.	Ukajj jupaw sañ muni.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
It happened so fast.	Ukham jankʼakiw pasäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
There was never anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham utjkänti.
He knew better now.	Jupajj jichhajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
Hope to see you there soon.	Ukan jankʼak uñjañ suytʼaskta.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
You are welcome!.	Janiw kunatsa!.
He didn't want to know.	Jupajj janiw yatiñ munkänti.
It was obviously reluctant.	Ukajj janiw munkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Nothing like this had ever happened before.	Janiw ukham kunas nayrajj utjkänti.
An extremely long time.	Mä sinti jaya tiempo.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
He doesn't know that.	Jupajj janiw ukham yatkiti.
He did everything right.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sumwa luräna.
I didn’t do that.	Janiw nayax ukham lurkti.
He’s the only one who knows.	Jupa sapakiw yati.
He wasn't sure how he felt about it.	Uka toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
I don’t need this.	Nayatakix janiw akax wakiskiti.
It was a slow motion.	Ukhamwa amuyasïna.
I want to know for myself.	Naya pachpaw yatiñ munta.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
I know it's pretty good.	Nayax wali sum yatta.
I knew exactly how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum yatiyäta.
John loves coffee.	Juanajj café wal gusti.
He saw exactly how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk sum uñjäna.
I almost never do that.	Niya janipuniw ukham lurkti.
There was nothing to do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
So he didn't do it.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurkänti.
He decided to do it.	Jupaw uk lurañ amtäna.
What does this mean.	Kunas akax sañ muni.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
So why do they like it so much?.	Ukhamajj ¿kunatsa jupanakar wal gusti?.
But they have a .	Ukampis jupanakax mä .
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was kind of like that.	Jupax mä juk’a ukhamänwa.
But when he did, .	Ukampis ukham luräna ukhajja, .
I know you understand.	Nayax yattwa jumax amuyasta.
But it’s not about that.	Ukampis janiw uka tuqitxa.
He doesn't want to know.	Jupajj janiw yatiñ munkiti.
I just saw that.	Nayax jichhakiw uk uñjta.
Myself, too.	Naya pachpa, ukhamaraki.
Nothing he understood better.	Janiw kunas jupajj jukʼamp sum amuykänti.
And it happened for a while.	Ukat mä tiempow ukham pasäna.
But you get your point.	Ukampis jumajj kuntï siskta uk sum amuyta.
He wants to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa muni.
No, it really was.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
And that was it.	Ukat ukax ukhamänwa.
I’m concerned about that.	Uka tuqitxa nayax llakistwa.
I understand how he feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum amuyasta.
The here and now.	Uka akan ukat jichhax.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
And that was it for me.	Ukat nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
You just have to do it.	Jumax ukhamakiw lurañama.
That, where to find it, where to find it!.	Ukax, kawkhans jikxatasi, kawkhans jikxatasi!.
He was the only one who thought.	Jupa sapakiw amuyäna.
You always have to do something.	Sapa kutiw kuns lurañama.
Good, but not three times better.	Suma, ukampis janiw kimsa kuti juk’amp askïkiti.
No, in this case .	Janiwa, aka tuqitxa .
I don’t see what you’re saying.	Nayax janiw kuntix jumax siskta uk uñjkti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
I’m really overwhelmed.	Chiqpachansa nayax wali ch’amampiw jikxatastxa.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He saw it.	Uk uñjäna.
It’s just available.	Ukax jichhakiw utji.
That's what he said.	Ukham sasaw jupajj säna.
I don’t want that.	Janiw nayax uk munkti.
And indeed it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
It is almost .	Ukax niya .
You know he really wants to go.	Jumax yatisktawa jupax chiqpachapuniw sarañ muni.
That's what you wanted.	Ukaw jumajj munäna.
He still feels that way, at least.	Jupax wali ukham jikxatasi, mä juk’a.
He didn't know why he said that again.	Kunatsa wasitat ukham säna uk janiw yatkänti.
You have to do this very carefully.	Ukajj wali sumwa lurañama.
And he knew what was going to happen.	Ukat kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.
And frankly, that’s not good enough.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax janiw askïkiti.
It’s really like that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
I think he means it.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uk sañ muni.
He knew these things well.	Jupajj ukanak sum yatïna.
There was nothing more to do.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkänti.
He doesn’t want to see me.	Janiw nayar uñjañ munkiti.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I don’t know anything about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns yatkti.
I haven’t seen anything like that.	Janiw nayax ukham ukham uñjkti.
But it never happens.	Ukampis janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
That’s about long enough.	Ukax niya jaya pachaw sañ muni.
That’s the only thing that matters.	Uka sapakiw wakisi.
There was a lot of excitement about it.	Uk uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
There was nothing else.	Janiw yaqha kunas utjkänti.
And somehow .	Ukat kunjamatsa .
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
He didn't know how.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa uk yatkänti.
Or it doesn't.	Jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There’s nothing special about it.	Ukanx janiw kunas wali askïkiti.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
I’m still worth it.	Nayax wali askiwa.
There is no .	Ukax mä .
I think it was pretty quick.	Nayax wali jank’akiw ukham luratayna sasaw amuyta.
I think he was.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukhamänwa.
He said nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak toqet kuns siskänti.
I don’t think so, of course.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
That was nothing to do.	Ukajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
And beyond that, he was happy.	Ukat ukat sipansa, jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He knew what he meant.	Jupajj kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna.
That’s a good guy.	Ukax mä suma jaqiwa.

He actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham luräna.

But not for one reason or another.	Ukampis janiw mä kunatsa ukham lurañjamäkiti.

But somehow .	Ukampis kunjamatsa .
And he decided to see it for himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw uk uñjañ amtäna.

Tom knew this very well.	Tom jilatajj uka toqet sum yatïna.

That’s really good.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
But he never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
It’s the same person.	Ukax pachpa jaqiwa.
So it’s incredible.	Ukhamajj janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
We don’t need to do that.	Jiwasax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
But that's even better.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
And then one day it wasn’t.	Ukat ukat mä urux janiw ukhamäkänti.
He decided to go there.	Jupaw uka cheqar sarañ amtäna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

He doesn’t want to tell.	Jupax janiw yatiyañ munkiti.

He wasn't sure why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkänti.

In that case, it was.	Uka tuqitxa, ukhamänwa.

But that's how he felt.	Ukampis ukhamwa jupajj jikjjatasïna.

I’m a little disappointed.	Nayax mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatastxa.

I don't know much about it.	Janiw walpun yatkti.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.

I don't believe it.	Nayajj janiw creykti.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.	Mä juk’a aka, mä juk’a uka.

There was never anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham utjkänti.
So it is obvious.	Ukhamajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He doesn’t really want much about it.	Jupax janiw chiqpachans uka tuqit sinti munkiti.
That’s what he wants.	Ukaw jupajj muni.
He certainly did it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk luräna.

He wanted to eat.	Jupax manq’añ munäna.
You are a very nice guy.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.

So far today I liked something.	Jichhakamax jichhürunakanx kunas nayatakix wali askiwa.

He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
I don’t really want to do that again.	Janiw chiqpachansa wasitat ukham lurañ munkti.
But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I don’t want him alone.	Janiw jupa sapak munkti.
It doesn’t matter .	Janiw kunas wakiskiti .
It’s really not worth the money.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka qullqix wakiskiti.
Is it necessary to do so.	Ukham lurañajj wakisispati.
I’m pretty excited about this.	Nayax aka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.

There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
Do this twice a day.	Uka urux pä kutiw ukham lurañama.

He didn't really want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
It was the same in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa.
He said he couldn’t believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti sasaw säna.

Not that he didn't do anything.	Janiw jupajj jan kuns lurkänti.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
He had no idea how long it had been.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasäna uk janiw amuykänti.

He didn't have much time.	Jupajj janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
No, he’s not there right now.	Janiwa, jupax janiw jichhax utjkiti.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
Also, of course.	Ukhamaraki, chiqpachansa.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He didn't know where it was.	Jupajj kawkhansa ukajj uk janiw yatkänti.
And how he walked.	Ukat kunjamsa sarnaqäna.
He’s a character.	Jupax mä jaqiwa.
I understand that well.	Uk sum amuyasta.
But it was a long time for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali jaya tiempow pasäna.
He never wanted that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk munkänti.
You know what.	Jumax yatisktawa kuns.
But there will be something else to do.	Ukampis yaqha lurañaw utjani.
Or he was very happy.	Jan ukajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sum yatta.

He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
But not this, of course.	Ukampis janiw akax ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
Do this with great caution.	Wali amuyumpiw uk lurañama.

I don't have much time.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkituti.
I didn’t have to go anywhere.	Janiw mä chiqar sarañax wakiskänti.

How big and spacious.	Kunjamsa jach’a ukat wali jach’a.
He knew all along.	Jupajj taqe tiempow yatïna.
And something moved.	Ukat kunas sarnaqäna.

I don’t know why.	Nayax janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
He knows about it.	Jupaw uka toqet yati.
I’m still thinking about it.	Nayax wali amuyta.
He couldn’t drive anywhere now.	Jichhax janiw kawkirus auto apnaqañ puedkänti.
But, it wasn’t.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkänti.
You’re the only one who can do that.	Juma sapakiw ukham lurasma.
No, it’s never been.	Janiwa, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
He said he couldn’t remember.	Jupax janiw amtaskti sasaw säna.
He didn't know exactly what it was.	Jupajj janiw kunas uk sum yatkänti.

I’m looking after the house.	Nayax uta uñjta.

But they’re good enough.	Ukampis jupanakax wali askiwa.
It feels like a long time to me.	Nayatakix wali jaya tiempow ukham amuyasi.
He meant something.	Jupajj kunsa sañ munäna.
He’s still in pain.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
He never wanted to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurañ munkänti.
But not today.	Ukampis janiw jichhürunakanxa.
There is something you can do.	Kuna lurañas wakisispa.
But really, it was something.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, kunas ukhamänwa.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
But he refused to buy it.	Ukampis janiw alañ munkänti.
That’s how everything is.	Ukhamaw taqi kunas utji.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
It’s also not about that.	Ukhamaraki janiwa uka tuqitxa.
I felt the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw amuyayäta.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sum yatta.
He told me to.	Jupaw nayarojj sitäna.
But he didn’t want to.	Ukampis janiw munkänti.
I don’t know why.	Nayax janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
I have known this for a long time now.	Jichhajj walja tiempow uk yatta.
And no one noticed.	Ukat janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
He seemed uncertain.	Jupajj jan sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.

That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
What that meant.	Kuntï ukajj sañ munkäna.
I think it really was.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.

He already knew it.	Jupajj niyaw uk yatïna.
Very bad, too.	Wali jan wali, ukhamaraki.
But he couldn’t.	Ukampis janiw puedkänti.
I really don’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkti.
But that's the way it is.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamawa.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Very comfortable and delicious.	Wali suma ukat wali suma.

I know there is something but nothing.	Nayax yattwa kunas utji ukampis janiw kunas utjkiti.
I'm still feeling depressed.	Nayajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I have nothing to do with it.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti.
But no one knew when that would happen.	Ukampis kunapachas ukham pasani uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
But, it’s not like that.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s really impossible.	Chiqpachansa janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
So it was pretty much now or never.	Ukhamajj niyaw jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
This, and this, but not this.	Aka, ukat aka, ukampis janiw aka.
But he wasn't about to admit it.	Ukampis janiw niyaw uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
Not like that was the case.	Janiw kunjamtï ukajj utjkänti.
No, on the other hand.	Janiwa, yaqha tuqitxa.
It’s slow, long.	Ukax llamp’u, jaya.
But there is nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I’m thinking about it.	Nayax amuyta.
He knows all about it.	Jupaw taqe ukanak yati.
I think that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyta.
What's going on.	Kunas pasaski.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
It’s location, location, location.	Ukax kawkhans utji, kawkhans jikxatasi, kawkhans jikxatasi.
I didn't know that.	Nayajj janiw uk yatkayätti.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kunas lurañax utjkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he was very happy.	Ukat jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He didn’t know how.	Jupax janiw kunjamsa uk yatkänti.
He’s such a nice guy.	Jupax ukham suma jaqiwa.
He used to be like that.	Jupajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
He desperately needed some money.	Jupajj mä jukʼa qollqe wal munäna.
No one did it better.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp sum lurkänti.

I want to go with you.	Nayajj jumamp chik sarañ munta.

That was how he saw it now.	Ukhamwa jichhajj uñjäna.
That didn't last long.	Ukajj janiw jaya tiempojj utjkänti.
Or, it used to be.	Jan ukajj, nayrajj ukhamänwa.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He was the one who told me.	Jupaw khitis sitäna.
He made the right decision.	Jupajj sumwa amtäna.
Really, it’s worth it.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa.
He didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkänti.
He’s having a lot of fun, too.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi, ukhamaraki.
He just felt it, but he didn't do anything.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jikjjatasïna, ukampis janiw kuns lurkänti.
That doesn't mean it wasn't.	Ukajj janiw jan ukhamäkänti sañ munkiti.
He could never do that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk lurañ puedkänti.
He never said that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk siskänti.

That’s what this will be.	Ukaw akax utjani.

You’re right.	Jumax amuyta.

No one knew for sure.	Janiw khitis sum yatkänti.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.

But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ munkänti.

But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
There isn’t.	Janiw utjkiti.
I didn’t want to.	Janiw munkayätti.

And he just did it.	Ukat jupax ukhamakiw lurawayi.
He’s doing everything right.	Taqi kunsa sum luraski.

No one can believe it.	Janiw khitis iyaw sañjamäkiti.
So they bought a house.	Ukatwa jupanakajj mä uta alasïna.
He’s very unhappy.	Jupax wali jan kusisitaw jikxatasi.

And nothing was like that again.	Ukat janiw kunas mayampsa ukham utjkänti.

Therefore, he did so.	Ukatwa ukham luräna.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.

I understand why he went.	Kunatsa saräna uk sum amuyasta.

How do you know that.	¿Kunjamatsa uk yatta.
But he didn't say that.	Ukampis janiw uk siskänti.
Every year is about	Sapa maraw niya .

He already feels like a bad guy doing that.	Jupajj ukham lurasajj niyaw jan wali jaqëkaspas ukham amuyasi.
He said that many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw ukham säna.
He didn't feel that way.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
And he loves her so much.	Ukat jupar wal munasi.

That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
Maybe a lot of it.	Inas walja.
You can do it all on your own.	Taqe ukanak juma pachpaw lurasma.
But that’s not really the case.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.

Maybe he can do something.	Inas jupajj kuns luraspa.
He did the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
I highly doubt that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun pächasta.

Too soon, he told himself.	Wali jankʼakiw sasaw jupa pachpa säna.

And he’ll do something wrong.	Ukat jupax kuna jan walinak lurani.

He was doing something.	Jupajj kuns luraskäna.

Now, there is no one here.	Jichhax, janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
So much better, much better.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa, jukʼamp askiwa.
I’m still in pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
I realize now that this was not the case for me.	Nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkänti, uk jichhajj amuyasta.
You know what it is.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas uk.
And he wanted to do that.	Ukat ukham lurañwa munäna.
It’s all about you.	Taqi kunas jumatakix ukhamawa.
Another bad day.	Yaqha jan wali uru.
He’s really tall and big.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw jach’a jach’a ukat jach’a jaqiwa.
He didn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.
He’ll do it for you.	Jupaw uk lurani.
Too long, in fact.	Sinti jaya tiempo, chiqpachansa.
Exactly and it happened.	Chiqpachansa ukat ukhamarakiw pasäna.
But it was nothing, not really.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukhamäkänti, janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkänti.
That’s about twice that amount.	Uka qullqix niya pä kutiw utji.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I haven’t seen anyone yet.	Janiw khitirus jichhakamax uñjkti.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
That means all the time.	Ukajj taqe tiempo sañ muni.
Now that’s a good thing.	Jichhax ukax wali askiwa.
Now it’s time to act.	Jichhax lurañ pachaw purini.
This was the first time he had done so.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw ukham luräna.
Financially worth it.	Qullqi tuqitxa wali askiwa.
I'm more worried about you.	Nayax jumat juk'amp llakistwa.
So that was obvious.	Ukhamajj ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
It almost feels like it.	Niya ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasi.
He was very cautious about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
He that night.	Jupa uka arumax.
We can’t believe it.	Jiwasax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
They had nothing for me.	Jupanakajj janiw kunas nayatak utjkänti.
I know who it is.	Khitis uk yattwa.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
One more thing needs to be done.	Mä jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
I don't know how to manage that much money.	Janiw kunjamsa uka walja qollqe apnaqañ yatkti.
So there is nothing.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
You have to do it yourself, alone.	Juma pachpaw uk lurañama, sapakiw lurañama.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I don’t want to use it.	Nayax janiw apnaqañ munkti.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He agreed very reluctantly.	Jupax wali jan munasiñampiw iyaw säna.
Never a bad day, really.	Janipuniw jan wali urux utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
I don’t want to tell you that.	Janiw nayax ukham yatiyañ munkti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
That was what kept him from speaking.	Ukaw jan parlañ puedkänti.
But I am not like that.	Ukampis janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.
Everyone needs to do that.	Taqinipuniw ukham lurañax wakisi.
He couldn't drive.	Jupajj janiw auto apnaqañ puedkänti.
I never thought of it before.	Janipuniw nayrajj uk amuyirïkti.
I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Definitely more needs to be done.	Chiqpachansa jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
This is my only money.	Akax nayan sapakiw qullqix utji.
This happened several times, of course.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasäna, ukhamänwa.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He saw it very well.	Jupax wali suma uñjäna.
I don’t know who I am.	Janiw khitis nayax sañ munkti.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He is himself himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupa pachpa.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I can’t remember many more like that.	Nayax juk’amp walja ukham ukham amtaskti.
He asked her to do so.	Ukham lurañapatakiw jupar mayïna.
And I really like that.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I can’t do anything right now.	Jichhax janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
It cannot last long.	Janiw jaya tiempojj utjkaspati.

I didn't want to.	Nayajj janiw munkayätti.
I feel good about doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
He did exactly what he said he would do.	Kuntï siskäna uk sumwa luräna.
If you have a.	Ukax mä...
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he was still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
And he didn’t know about it.	Ukat jupax janiw uka tuqit yatkänti.
But I didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw nayajj kuns lurkti.
He chooses to do it infrequently .	Jupajj jan sapa kuti lurañwa amti .
You’re the only one who knows about this, right now.	Juma sapakiw aka tuqit yatta, jichhax.
He knows it well .	Jupajj uk sum yati .
He says he doesn’t remember.	Jupax janiw amtaskti sasaw saraki.
Great dining room as well.	Jach’a manq’añ uta ukhamaraki.
So he bought a car.	Ukatwa mä auto alasïna.
I know what happened to you.	Nayajj yattwa kunas jumanakar pasäna.
He knew how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañ yatïna.
But somehow it wasn’t.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw ukhamäkänti.
He will do it.	Jupajj uk lurani.
He understood why.	Kunatsa uk sum amuyäna.
He doesn't know any better.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He doesn't know what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa janiw yatkiti.
He was very happy to leave.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw sarjjäna.
He was a little .	Jupajj mä jukʼa .
He didn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykänti.
No one else did it.	Janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
That's a good thing for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
That is not the case now.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to use it.	Nayax ukanak apnaqañ munta.
A wonderful book.	Mä suma libro.

That's what he thought.	Ukaw jupajj amuyäna.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I didn’t want to see anyone.	Janiw khitirus uñjañ munkayätti.
That's what he likes.	Ukaw jupajj wal gusti.
In this case, no.	Uka tuqitxa, janiwa.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
Really, really good.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He had a different attitude.	Jupajj yaqha amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
He will build a house.	Jupaw mä uta lurani.
He really wanted to take care of her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar sum uñjañ munäna.
He understood what that meant to me.	Ukajj kunsa nayatakejj sañ munäna uk jupajj sum amuyäna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
Or worse, it needs to be done.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw wakisi.
And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
I totally understand you .	Nayax jumat taqpach amuyta .
I thought that was really good.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
And there’s no money.	Ukat janiw qullqix utjkiti.
So it's a good thing.	Ukhamajj wali askiwa.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t want to do anything.	Nayax janiw kuns lurañ munkti.
I am very, very disappointed.	Nayax wali, wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I really don’t have the money.	Chiqpachansa janiw qullqix utjkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
How he behaved .	Kunjamsa jupax sarnaqäna .
But he wasn't like that .	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti .
I’m really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
It means everything to me.	Nayatakix taqi kun sañ muni.
I don’t know what to do with him now.	Jichhax janiw kuns jupamp lurañax yatkti.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
How did you feel about it.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna.
But why, of course, .	Ukampis kunatsa, chiqpachansa, .
But beyond that, not really.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw chiqpachansa.
I don't want to talk to him.	Nayajj janiw jupamp parlañ munkti.
That’s not necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti.

Everything is going well.	Taqi kunas wali sum saraski.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj walpun munäna.
But no one knows that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk yatkiti.
That’s what he told me.	Ukhamaw jupax sitäna.
I don’t know what’s going to happen to him.	Janiw kunas jupar pasani uk yatkti.
But he definitely feels that way to me.	Ukampis jupajj cheqapuniw nayatakejj ukham amuyasi.
He was a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali sumwa uñjäna.
He didn't want to say that.	Jupajj janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
I want to go the other way.	Nayax yaqha tuqit sarañ munta.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

I didn't know that.	Nayajj janiw uk yatkayätti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
But there’s something about you.	Ukampis jumat kunas utji.
He had nothing to do with you.	Jupajj janiw jumamp kuns lurkänti.

I want them all.	Nayax taqiniruw munta.
I don’t want to see them again.	Janiw jupanakar mayamp uñjañ munkti.
This will do me!.	¡Akax nayaruw lurani!.
Do this several times.	Walja kutiw ukham lurañama.
It’s going to take some time.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw munasini.
So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
I don’t need to do any of that.	Nayax janiw ukanak lurañax wakiskiti.
Almost nothing at all.	Niya janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.

It doesn’t, of course.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
I didn't understand that.	Nayajj janiw uk amuykayätti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
The same is true of the character.	Ukhamarakiw sarnaqäna.
I will never do that again.	Janiw mayampsa ukham lurkäti.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
Three bad coins.	Kimsa jan wali qullqi.
Where, how big, and kind of.	Kawkhansa, qawqha jach’a, ukat mä kasta.
That was the case for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
He loves you so much.	Jupajj jumar walpun munasi.
He did this many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw ukham luräna.

Tomorrow is the first thing to do.	Qhipürux nayrïr lurañaw wakisi.
He didn't know what he was saying.	Jupajj janiw kuntï siskäna uk yatkänti.
Maybe it’s worth doing.	Inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
There was never anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham utjkänti.
So far, that’s the best thing I’ve ever done.	Jichhakamax ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I don’t think I’m buying this.	Nayax janiw nayax aka alañ munkti.
I am quite happy with all of this.	Nayajj taqe ukanak wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And you can do much worse.	Ukat jukʼamp jan walinak lurasma.
So now this is it.	Ukhamajj jichhajj aka.
And he felt good for a long time.	Ukat walja tiempow sum jikjjatasïna.
It’s a nice guy.	Mä suma jaqiwa.
Time flew by quickly.	Tiempojj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
Almost no one understands.	Niya janiw khitis amuykiti.

Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
He didn’t do it.	Janiw uk lurkänti.
On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
Or he walked too fast.	Jan ukajj wali jankʼak sarnaqäna.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
A lot of time alone.	Walja tiempo sapaki.
He doesn’t know anything.	Jupax janiw kuns yatkiti.
I’m in a hurry.	Nayax jank’akiw jikxatastxa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.

But it really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.

But he wanted it.	Ukampis jupajj uk munäna.
He knew these things well.	Jupajj ukanak sum yatïna.
But he was still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
That was something you said.	Ukajj mä kuntï jumajj siskta ukhamänwa.

I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I don’t mean that.	Janiw nayax uk sañ munkti.
But it wasn’t, it wasn’t.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Something big and bad and weird.	Kunas jach’a ukat jan wali ukat muspharkañ.

But he decides to do so.	Ukampis ukham lurañ amti.
But he will do it.	Ukampis jupaw uk lurani.
But I didn't understand	Ukampis janiw amuykayätti .
I never thought he would.	Janipuniw ukham lurani sasin amuyirïkti.
The guy didn’t feel that way.	Uka waynax janiw ukham amuyaskänti.

He felt it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.

But no one wants to know about it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uka tuqit yatiñ munkiti.
But that’s exactly the point.	Ukampis ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
I think he’s mature about it.	Nayatakix jupax uka tuqitx jilïr jaqiwa.
So it is obvious.	Ukhamajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He wants it.	Jupajj uk muni.
But it didn't mean that.	Ukampis janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
I'm going to go.	Nayax sarañ munta.

I don’t want to say that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkti.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
So I'm just like that.	Ukhamajj nayajj ukhamawa.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He decided immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw amtäna.
There is no way they exist.	Janiw kunjamatsa jupanakajj utjkiti.
Which is definitely not the case.	Ukax chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.

It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He needs to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañaw wakisi.
There is a lot of fun in doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
And that’s not what I like.	Ukat ukax janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
He’s the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham lurawayi.
Not about that.	Janiw uka tuqitxa.
So you need to do something wrong with me.	Ukhamajj nayat jan walinak lurañaw wakisi.
He’s really excited.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
It really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I feel better about myself.	Naya pachpaw jukʼamp sum jikjjatasta.
He thought that was unnecessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I loved that so much.	Nayajj ukajj walpun munta.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Or maybe two.	Jan ukajj inas pä.
I really want to see that.	Uk uñjañ walpun munta.
He loves it that much.	Jupajj ukham wal munasi.
Or I am still depressed.	Jan ukajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I think that’s good for you.	Nayax amuyta ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That's what he said.	Ukhamwa jupajj säna.
That didn't mean anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
But I didn’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkti.
Definitely beyond me.	Chiqpachansa nayat sipansa.
This is the first day here.	Akax nayrïr uruw akan utji.
He’s such a nice guy.	Jupax ukham suma jaqiwa.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
The school is the school.	Yatiqañ uta yatiqañ uta.
I don’t need that.	Nayax janiw ukax wakiskiti.
He seemed to know everything about every aspect.	Jupajj sapa toqet taqe kunsa yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
He said it didn’t matter.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti sasaw säna.
Or, maybe, three.	Jan ukax, inas, kimsa.
And he said no.	Ukat jupax janiw sasaw säna.
But it is not necessary to do these things.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
I wonder how he feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi sasaw jisktʼasta.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
So what is he again.	Ukhamajj kunas jupajj wasitat.
You know all about it.	Jumax taqi ukanak yatisktawa.
That was nothing to do.	Ukajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw siskänti.
Or me, for that matter.	Jan ukax naya, uka tuqitxa.
And it was very nice.	Ukat wali suma.
He knows what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa sum yati.
Nobody wants that.	Janiw khitis ukanak munkiti.
I feel pretty good about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa jikxatastxa.
I knew how bad it could be.	Kunjamsa jan walinak luraspa uk sum yatiyäta.
So it's a good thing.	Ukhamajj wali askiwa.
he says, 'It's not.	sasaw saraki.
And it wasn’t.	Ukat ukhamänwa.
But it is .	Ukampis ukajj .
I happily agreed.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw iyaw sista.
He was doing it himself.	Jupa pachpaw luraskäna.
Definitely no one today.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis jichhürunakanxa.
Sure enough, you know.	Chiqpachansa, jumax yatisktawa.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
I want to use it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukanak apnaqañ munta.
But that doesn't really matter.	Ukampis ukajj janiw cheqpachapun wakiskiti.
I haven’t seen one.	Janiw mä uñjkti.
How he used to see them.	Kunjamsa nayrajj jupanakar uñjäna.
That’s what it is now.	Ukax jichhax ukhamawa.
I'm not going to do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurkäti.
I mean with that attitude.	Nayax uka amuyumpiw sañ munta.

Here’s a little .	Akax mä juk’a .
And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s been a year now.	Mä maraw jichhax.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
I didn’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj walpun munäna.
They weren't like that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukajj ukhamäkiti.
But it does something for me.	Ukampis nayatakix kuns luraski.
There is nothing here about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
He knows all about it.	Jupaw taqe ukanak yati.
But we cannot agree with that.	Ukampis jiwasajj janiw uka toqet iyaw sañjamäkiti.
It was doing it big time.	Ukajj wali jachʼa tiempo luraskäna.
There is nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañax utjkiti.
That's how he started.	Ukhamaw jupajj qalltäna.
I think that is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw sasaw amuyta.
I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurawayta.
There is never anything.	Janipuniw kunas utjkiti.
There’s really nothing that bad about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham jan wali lurañax utjkiti.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He knew how, but he couldn't do it.	Kunjamsa uk sum yatïna, ukampis janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
They are not necessary.	Jupanakajj janiw wakiskiti.
He actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham luräna.
I want to see you.	Nayax jumar uñjañ munta.
That’s what he saw.	Ukaw jupar uñjäna.
It happened many times.	Walja kutiw ukham pasäna.
He’s got a lot of energy.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
This happened a long time ago.	Ukax nayratpachaw pasäna.
It all happened so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
Very expensive.	Sinti qullqi.
No, it’s really good.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
Nothing more can be done.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkaspati.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.
I don't do that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham lurkti.
But he never did anything wrong about it.	Ukampis janipuniw uka toqet jan walinak lurkänti.
I didn’t do that to anyone.	Nayax janiw khitirus ukham lurkänti.
He said he didn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak yatkti sasaw säna.
He didn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
You are a very nice guy.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
I don't understand that.	Nayajj janiw uk amuykti.
And he said he didn’t know.	Ukat jupax janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
I’m hoping that’s not the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw suyt’askta.
I'm not sure what to do	Nayax ukat .
But he didn't understand anything.	Ukampis janiw kunas uk amuykänti.
No one understood.	Janiw khitis amuykänti.
That is what happened to me.	Ukhamaw nayampejj pasäna.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
And she couldn't talk to anyone about what had happened before.	Ukat janiw khitirus nayrajj paskäna uka toqet parlañ puedkänti.
I didn’t know anything.	Janiw kuns yatkayätti.
I don’t know exactly what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw sum yatkti.
But that’s good for you.	Ukampis ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
Not so now, of course.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
There is a light somewhere.	Mä qhanaw kawkhans utji.
I loved that so much.	Nayax uk walpun munta.
It’s going nice and smooth.	Ukax suma ukat suma saraski.
I look forward to that again.	Ukajj wasitatwa suytʼaskta.
You’re a bad guy.	Jumax jan wali jaqiwa.
Large and spacious.	Jach’a ukat jach’a.
It was, of course.	Ukhamänwa, chiqpachansa.
He began to speak again.	Jupajj wasitatwa parlañ qalltäna.
I didn’t want to see that.	Janiw uk uñjañ munkayätti.
No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he doesn’t want to.	Ukampis janiw munkiti.
Honestly, you can’t do that.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I don’t say anything.	Janiw kuns siskti.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
But this is clearly not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkänti.
There is no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti.
And one thing.	Ukat mä kuna.
He knew that very well.	Jupaw uk sum yatïna.
It wasn’t, it never was.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I want everyone there.	Nayax taqiniruw ukan munta.

I want to be the same.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw munta.
It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
I don't know what to do	Nayajj janiw yatkti .
But he understood why he did it.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham luräna uk jupajj sum amuyäna.
I don't know exactly when that happened.	Kunapachas ukajj pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
It is not necessary now.	Janiw jichhajj wakiskiti.
It’s a fairly recent discovery.	Ukax mä juk’a jichhakiw jikxatasi.
Everything else.	Taqi kunas.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
And the worst kind.	Ukat jukʼamp jan wali kasta.

He never said otherwise.	Jupajj janipuniw yaqha ukham siskänti.
He knew better than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatïna.
You feel the same way.	Jumax ukhamarakiw amuyasta.
He was very active.	Jupajj wal chʼamachasïna.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
But this is it.	Ukampis akax ukhamawa.
I want to know how he did it, and why.	Kunjamsa uk luräna, ukat kunatsa uk yatiñ munta.
The guy can do well.	Uka waynax sum luraspa.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munäna.
I know he does that.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luraski.
So am I. I’m not.	Ukhamarakiw nayax.
So you know what’s going to happen to him.	Ukhamajj kunas jupar pasani uk jumajj yatisktawa.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak munkänti.
This is good for two reasons.	Ukax pä tuqit wali askiwa.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn’t say that, of course.	Jupax janiw ukham siskänti, chiqpachansa.
I don't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
It’s also good for me in terms of learning.	Ukhamarakiw nayatakix wali askiwa yatiqañ tuqitxa.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to be myself.	Nayajj naya pachpaw munta.
I’m thinking about it.	Nayax amuyta.
No, he didn't do that.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Everything feels real.	Taqi kunas chiqpachapuniw jikxatasi.
I am very sad about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He didn't want her.	Jupajj janiw jupar munkänti.
I know how to make coffee.	Nayax café lurañ yatta.
Both need to be done.	Panpachaniw lurañax wakisi.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He said he hadn't seen her in a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw uñjkti sasaw säna.
I see this and that.	Nayax aka ukat uka uñjta.
I pretty much told him that.	Nayajj niyaw jupar ukham sista.

He wanted to do it himself.	Jupa pachpa lurañwa munäna.
He did as he was told.	Jupajj kunjamtï siskäna ukhamwa luräna.
Bad, but still.	Jan wali, ukampis wali.

I didn't understand him.	Nayajj jupar janiw sum amuykayätti.
And why not, of course.	Ukat kunatsa jan ukhamäki, chiqpachansa.
It started well enough.	Ukajj wali sumwa qalltäna.
Very good indeed.	Wali suma chiqpachansa.
I know how that is.	Kunjamsa ukajj uk sum yatta.
The best thing to do is to do both.	Ukax wali askiwa, panpachaniw lurañama.

So far it’s been good.	Jichhakamax wali askiwa.
It wants to go with you.	Ukax jumamp chika sarañ muni.
We know a sum.	Uk sum yatta.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.

Really, really.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.

A little longer.	Mä juk’amp jaya.
He didn't know how he knew it, but he knew it.	Kunjamsa uk yatïna uk janiw yatkänti, ukampis uk yatïna.

But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.

He knew immediately what it was.	Kunas ukajj uk jankʼakiw yatïna.
And he wasn't sure why.	Ukat kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.

But somehow, that wasn’t enough.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, ukax janiw wakiskänti.
And more needs to be done.	Ukat juk’amp lurañaw wakisi.

But in one respect it was not.	Ukampis mä tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkänti.

He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
Today, of course.	Jichhürunakanxa, chiqpachansa.
I’m hoping that’s not the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw suyt’askta.
He told me what it was.	Jupaw kunas uk sitäna.
We are better off.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp askiwa.
He lives alone.	Jupajj sapakiw jakasi.
I still see this all the time.	Nayax akax taqi pachaw wali uñjta.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
There really is nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkiti.

No one knows what happened to you.	Kunas jumamp pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He’s done just about everything.	Jupax niya taqi kuns lurawayi.
Something much bigger.	Kunas juk’amp jach’a.
He wanted to see it.	Jupajj uka uñjañ wal munäna.
He wanted me to be.	Jupajj nayaruw munäna.
That’s what it means.	Ukax ukham sañ muni.
This is obviously not the case.	Ukajj qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
I know what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk sum yatta.
He had no idea what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk janiw amuykänti.
But there is no other option.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
He meant it .	Jupajj uk sañ munäna .
He was almost	Jupajj niya .
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayatakix ukax wali askiwa.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
He doesn’t want to go to school today.	Jupax jichhürunakanx janiw yatiqañ utar sarañ munkiti.
It’s not all money.	Janiw taqpach qullqix utjkiti.
I look forward to each new day with him.	Jupamp chika sapa machaq uru suyt’askta.

I'm not saying that.	Janiw nayajj ukham siskti.
He knew that now.	Jupajj uk jichhajj sum yatïna.
But it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
I don't need to do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
You know what it is.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas ukax.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He knew what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
And he’s all alone.	Ukat jupax taqpach sapakiw jikxatasi.

So it happened to me once or twice.	Ukhamajj mä kuti jan ukajj pä kutiw nayar pasäna.
I’m extremely excited.	Nayax sinti kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

He is doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraski.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas wakiskiti.
And, that’s fine.	Ukat, ukax wali askiwa.
I don’t want to.	Nayax janiw munkti.
I thought that said something about me.	Ukajj nayat kuns säna sasaw amuyayäta.
But it was a clear start.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw qalltäna.
I like it, this car.	Nayatakix wali askiwa, aka auto.
A couple of nights.	Mä pä arumax.
And money, of course.	Ukat qullqi, chiqpachansa.
So he lives alone.	Ukhamajj sapakiw jakasi.
I can’t do anything about it.	Janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
It doesn't matter, he thought.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, sasaw amuyäna.
He started to say that.	Jupax ukham sañ qalltäna.
I did this not too long ago.	Nayax janiw sinti nayrax ukham lurawayta.
It never means that.	Janipuniw ukham sañ munkiti.

That's what he .	Ukajj jupajj .
He felt himself doing so.	Ukham lurasajj jupa pachpaw amuyasïna.
Money, money, money.	Qullqi, qullqi, qullqi.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
That happened once.	Ukajj mä kutiw pasäna.
But he didn't mean that, she said.	Ukampis janiw uk sañ munkänti, sasaw jupajj säna.
Wrong, just wrong.	Jan wali, ukhamakiw jan wali.
I wasn't such a big thinker.	Janiw ukham jachʼa amuyirïkti.

I’m taking good care of that.	Nayax uka tuqit sum uñjta.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw ukham munkänti.
But he lives again.	Ukampis wasitatwa jakasi.
But he never wanted to believe it.	Ukampis janipuniw iyaw sañ munkänti.
It’s not like he is.	Janiw jupax ukhamäkiti.
You can do it almost anywhere.	Niya kawkhansa ukanak lurasma.
So it wasn't very long.	Ukhamajj janiw sinti jaya tiempojj ukhamäkänti.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It knows exactly where you are.	Ukajj kawkhansa jikjjatasta uk sum yati.
What’s great, what .	Kunas jach’a, kuna .
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never want to see that again.	Janipuniw mayampsa ukham uñjañ munkti.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas utjkaspati.
And it can’t be that way.	Ukat janiw ukham utjkaspati.
But he was very cautious.	Ukampis jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
Probably longer than that.	Inas ukat sipansa jukʼamp jaya.
I am so glad he did.	Ukham luratapat walpun kusista.
He says he wasn't.	Janiw jupajj utjkänti sasaw saraki.
Something happened.	Kunas pasäna.
But this will happen too.	Ukampis akax ukhamarakiw pasani.

So it never happened.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I can’t do that again.	Nayax janiw uka wasitat lurañjamäkiti.

Or he was, anyway.	Jan ukajj jupajj ukhamänwa, kunjamatsa.
I have seen this used myself.	Naya pachpaw aka apnaqañ uñjta.
He wasn't sure about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet sum amuyaskänti.
He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't know.	Jupajj janiw yatkänti.
You can do it right now.	Jichhakiw uk lurasma.
But the guy wasn’t here anywhere.	Ukampis uka waynax janiw akan kawkhans utjkänti.
That’s a good thing for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.

And he knew why.	Ukat kunatsa uk yatïna.
I think that’s the best thing about me.	Nayax amuyta, ukax nayat wali askiwa.

It didn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkänti.

No one else did that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.

But it really doesn’t matter.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukax wakiskiti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He started again.	Jupajj wasitatwa qalltäna.
So no one knows.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis yatkiti.
Honestly, I feel better.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼamp sum jikxatastxa.
He didn't know that.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti.
That’s what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj munäna.
He did it well enough.	Jupajj sumwa uk luräna.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
Great day indeed.	Jach’a uru chiqpachansa.
There is no need to do anything else about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw yaqha tuqit lurañax wakiskiti.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukhamwa amuyasïna.

But Tom did it.	Ukampis Tom jilatajj uk luräna.
But he was, so that was it.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa, ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
He gave it to them.	Jupaw jupanakar uk churäna.

Almost everything about it is good.	Uka tuqitxa niya taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I thought he wanted to go with me.	Jupajj nayamp chika sarañ muni sasaw amuyayäta.

In both cases.	Pä tuqitxa.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
It’s not good for you.	Janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
It really needs to be done.	Chiqpachansa, ukham lurañaw wakisi.

And that’s exactly what it’s about.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.

But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
There wasn't much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.

But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.

He wasn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

Not everything is possible.	Janiw taqi kunas utjkaspati.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
It is almost .	Ukax niya .
I think that is pretty obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw sasaw amuyta.
It didn’t feel like it.	Janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
It felt better.	Ukajj jukʼamp sumwa amuyasïna.
So he’s both.	Ukhamajj panpachaniw jupajj.
It certainly wasn’t for me.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix ukhamäkänti.
Now, with you.	Jichhax, jumamp chika.
But it’s not that kind of night.	Ukampis janiw ukham arumax ukhamäkiti.
I am not denying that.	Janiw nayajj uk jan iyaw siskti.
I thought quickly.	Nayax jank'akiw amuyta.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
He is a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqewa.
No one doesn’t like him.	Janiw khitis jupar jan gustkiti.
I didn’t mean all that.	Janiw taqe ukanak sañ munkayätti.

Everyone has something, he says.	Taqinipuniw kunas utji, sasaw saraki.
He will do it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa lurani.
But he didn't want to talk to me.	Ukampis janiw nayamp parlañ munkänti.
There was no reason to rush.	Janiw kunatsa jankʼak lurañajj utjkänti.
But that is not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
If anyone knew less than I did, he knew better.	Khitis nayat jukʼamp jan yatkaspa ukhajja, jukʼamp sumwa yatïna.
He obviously wanted to talk to her.	Jupajj qhanaw jupamp parltʼañ munäna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He had no idea what it was.	Jupajj kunas ukajj uk janiw amuykänti.
He was happy all day.	Jupajj taqe uruw kusisit jikjjatasïna.
I have nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkituti.
He saw the car.	Jupajj uka auto uñjäna.
He’s not like that right now.	Jupax jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luräna.
Or anyone, really.	Jan ukax khitis, chiqpachansa.
He didn't want to say anything.	Janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
But it was, for me anyway.	Ukampis ukhamänwa, nayatakejj kunjamatsa.
I think it’s good to do that.	Nayax amuyta, ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
And he just started.	Ukat jupax jichhakiw qalltäna.
And that’s it! 	¡Ukat ukax!
He knows about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yati.
But that is not possible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
Fortunately that wasn’t the case.	Wali askiwa ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
There was no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkänti.
He didn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatkänti.

Everything is good now.	Jichhax taqi kunas wali askiwa.

There is no way to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax utjkiti.
He never said that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham siskänti.
You’ll need it every now and then.	Jichhax sapa kutiw ukax munasini.

Tom himself said so.	Tom jupa pachpaw ukham säna.
No one thinks that way.	Janiw khitis ukham amuykiti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I didn't know about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet yatkayätti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There’s something there.	Ukanx kunas utji.
You want to talk, you want to talk.	Jumax parlañ munta, parlañ munta.

He understood me.	Jupaw nayarojj amuyasïna.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.

So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
And you can’t do that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I understood that perfectly.	Nayajj uk sum amuyayäta.
I agree with him.	Nayajj jupamp chikaw iyaw sista.

This is not something you can do.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
They are really good for me.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
It wasn’t the case.	Janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s what happened.	Ukaw pasäna.
I mean the worst.	Nayax juk’amp jan walinak sañ munta.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax luräna.
And he acted like that.	Ukat jupax ukhamarakiw sarnaqäna.
But it is better today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa jukʼamp askiwa.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
He saw it happen.	Jupajj kunjamtï paskäna uk uñjäna.
All over again, myself.	Taqi kunas wasitatwa, naya pachpa.
It’s a very big deal.	Sinti jach’a jaqiwa.
No, on the other hand.	Janiwa, yaqha tuqitxa.
I knew exactly where I wanted to go.	Kawkirus sarañ munta uk sum yatiyäta.
He says he doesn't know yet.	Jichhakamax janiw yatkti sasaw saraki.
I didn't want to hurt him.	Janiw nayajj jupar jan walinak lurañ munkayätti.
Both of them are.	Panpachaniw jupanakax.
I’m sorry you have to rush this.	Nayax llakistwa akax jank’akiw lurañama.
That is what is needed now.	Ukaw jichhajj wakisi.
No one knows why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.

I like this one very much.	Nayatakix akax wali askiwa.
Tom went quickly.	Tom jilatajj jankʼakiw saräna.
But, it’s already coming.	Ukampis, niyaw purini.
What’s going on?.	¿Kunas pasaski?.
I’ve seen it all over the country.	Nayax taqi markan uñjta.
Or, at least it was.	Jan ukajj, mä jukʼa tiempojj ukhamänwa.
It doesn’t matter who, what it is.	Janiw khitis, kunas ukax wakiskiti.
No one knew about it.	Janiw khitis yatkänti.
He did something.	Jupajj kunsa luräna.
It’s not entirely like that.	Janiw taqpach ukhamäkiti.
I know there isn’t.	Nayax yattwa janiw utjkiti.
And that's a good thing.	Ukat ukajj wali askiwa.
You have to do it yourself.	Jumax juma pachpaw lurañama.
He knows these things well.	Jupajj ukanak sum yati.
He was passionate about it.	Jupajj uka toqet walpun munäna.
So I don't like it.	Ukhamajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
I think maybe.	Nayax amuyta inas.
How fast time flies.	Kunjamsa tiempojj jankʼak pasaski.
I want to know where it is.	Kawkhansa uk yatiñ munta.
He politely refused.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw jan munkänti.
Why why why why.	Kunatsa kunatsa kunatsa kunatsa.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
I didn't know why.	Kunatsa uk janiw yatkayätti.
I’ve never seen anything quite like it.	Janipuniw kunas ukham taqpach uñjkti.
But, it’s not worth doing it all over again.	Ukampis, janiw taqi ukanak wasitat lurañax askïkiti.
I really don’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkti.
I don’t know anything.	Nayax janiw kuns yatkti.
But that's even better.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
It’s not like that at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
But how long does he have?.	Ukampis ¿qhawqha tiempos jupajj utji?.
I've been feeling that way.	Nayajj ukham amuyasta.
He knew about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yatïna.
This was obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Now he’s happy.	Jichhax jupax kusisitaw jikxatasi.
And now you know .	Ukat jichhax jumax yatisktawa .
It’s not like that again.	Janiw mayamp ukhamäkiti.
Really, .	Chiqpachansa, .
There’s no way you can say it’s not.	Janiw kunjamatsa janiw ukhamäkiti sañjamäkiti.
You know it doesn’t.	Jumax yatisktawa janiw ukhamäkiti.
That will do it for me.	Ukaw nayatakejj lurani.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
He’s a bad guy.	Jupax mä jan wali jaqiwa.
I don’t think anyone did.	Nayax janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
Today, however, this is not the case.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa, janiw ukax askïkiti.
That’s what did it.	Ukaw ukham luräna.
How he behaved.	Kunjamsa jupax sarnaqäna.
He went quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw saräna.
He knew his way around.	Jupajj kunjamsa sarnaqäna uk sum yatïna.
I want to say something.	Nayax kuns sañ munta.
Both of them, actually.	Panpachaniw, chiqpachansa.
He did what he wanted to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkäna uk luräna.
And he wanted to talk to her.	Ukat jupampiw parltʼañ munäna.
But, it’s not like that.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkiti.
So he went away.	Ukatwa jupajj saräna.
He seemed to know.	Jupajj yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
I didn't know how to do anything about it.	Uka toqet kunjamsa kun lurañsa janiw yatkayätti.
One thing is clear.	Mä tuqitxa qhanaw amuyasi.
This is not really the case.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkiti.

In this case, and .	Uka tuqitxa, ukat .

For me, it’s the same.	Nayatakix ukhamaraki.

Maybe one day.	Inas mä urux.
I don't know.	Janiw yatkti.
He didn't say anything.	Janiw kunas jupajj siskänti.
I never thought it would happen.	Janipuniw ukham pasani sasin amuyirïkti.
He wanted to do more.	Jupajj jukʼamp lurañwa munäna.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He started this place.	Jupaw aka chiqar qalltäna.
Or longer, maybe longer.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp jaya, inas jukʼamp jaya tiempo.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
But he was .	Ukampis jupajj .
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
He didn’t want to tell me anything else.	Jupax janiw yaqha tuqit yatiyañ munkänti.
I’m sorry for you.	Nayax jumat llakistwa.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.

And it’s not like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.

Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I’m not going to do that for any reason.	Nayax janiw kunatsa ukham lurkäti.

He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Janiw jan wal lurañ munkayätti.
There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.

I probably never will.	Inas janipuniw ukham lurkäti.

You can’t afford it.	Jumax janiw uka qullqix utjkaspati.
He has no idea how to do that.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk luraspa uk janiw amuykiti.
That is already happening.	Ukajj niyaw ukham luraski.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
He just knows that.	Jupax ukhamakiw yati.
I don’t want that.	Janiw nayax uk munkti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.

It needs to be repeated.	Ukax wasitat lurañaw wakisi.
But now he wanted nothing more.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkänti.

So what is happening.	Ukhamajj kunas pasaski.
He wanted it from me.	Jupajj nayat walpun munäna.
I was so happy to see him.	Jupar uñjasajj walpun kusista.
He began to preach very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa yatiyañ qalltäna.

He didn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.

I have no idea how he knew about me.	Kunjamsa nayat yatïna uk janiw amuykti.
I don't think he did.	Janiw ukham lurkänti sasaw amuyta.
But that is not the case today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sumwa yatïna.
That’s it, of course.	Ukax ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
That’s what you need.	Ukaw jumatakix wakisi.

Actually, that’s what it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamawa.
I told everyone.	Taqiniruw sista.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t want to see him like that.	Janiw jupar ukham uñjañ munkayätti.

No one at all.	Janiw khitis kunjamatsa.

He seemed to be a very tall man.	Jupajj wali jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
I want to do something.	Nayax kuns lurañ munta.

He was a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali sumwa uñjäna.

Of course.	Ukhamawa.
He knew more than I did, it turned out.	Jupax nayat sipan juk’amp yatïna, ukhamaw jikxatasïna.

I really understand that.	Chiqpachansa uk sum amuyta.
No one wanted to know about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit yatiñ munkänti.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.

I just saw this happen the other day.	Jichhakiw yaqha urux ukham luraskäna uk uñjta.
Everyone means well.	Taqinipuniw sum sañ muni.
It wasn’t like this now.	Janiw jichhax ukhamäkänti.

I’m saying that myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham sista.
I didn't do these things.	Janiw nayajj ukanak lurkti.
I am not sure about that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
So he can do anything.	Ukhamajj kuns luraspa.
It’s so understandable!.	¡Walpun amuyasi!.
But he never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
But he can definitely do it all.	Ukampis jupax chiqpachapuniw taqi ukanak luraspa.
I don't need that.	Nayajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
But he didn't do it the way he wanted to.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï munkäna ukham lurkänti.
He longed to see her again.	Jupajj wasitat uñjañ wal munäna.
And he loved it.	Ukat jupajj uk walpun munäna.
Or so he said.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj säna.
This is clearly not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
No one knows the answer.	Janiw khitis yatkiti.
That's what he said to her.	Ukham sasaw jupar säna.
I saw him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar uñjta.
Nothing about that.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
It was obvious that he didn't like me.	Jupajj janiw nayar gustkituti ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
And now I’m still happy.	Ukat jichhax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.

It seemed like a very nice person.	Ukajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

He’s a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
I am not sure what causes this.	Kunas ukham luraspa uk janiw sum yatkti.
He preferred it anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk jukʼamp munäna.
I don’t say anything.	Janiw kuns siskti.
He’s a different person.	Jupax yaqha jaqiwa.

It’s also very useful.	Ukhamaraki wali askiwa.
But the weather was not.	Ukampis tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
So there was no time.	Ukhamajj janiw tiempojj utjkänti.
And another one.	Ukat yaqha.
He didn’t want that and he was happy.	Jupax janiw uk munkänti ukat jupax kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
That happened yesterday.	Ukax qharüruw pasäna.
He wasn't sure who he thought would do it.	Khitis uk lurani sasin amuyäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.

There’s both.	Ukax panpachaniw utji.
It’s also a bad thing.	Ukhamaraki jan wali.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk lurañama.

He’s been around for a while.	Jupax mä juk’a pachaw jikxatasïna.

So it's a slow motion.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa.
Everything else is good as well.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa ukhamaraki.
He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
You can’t do my thing.	Jumax janiw nayan lurañjamäkiti.
He used to be like that.	Jupajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
I never thought of it before.	Janipuniw nayrajj uk amuyirïkti.
He was feeling sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I don’t think that’s a good thing.	Nayatakix ukax janiw askïkiti.
And a long one.	Ukat mä jaya.
You need to do this quickly.	Jankʼakiw uk lurañama.

So far this has been good.	Jichhakamax akax wali askiwa.
He was very affectionate.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw uñjäna.
He had done it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw uk luratayna.
It felt better alone.	Ukajj sapakiw jukʼamp sum jikjjatasïna.
I didn't want to know about it.	Janiw uka toqet yatiñ munkayätti.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
So he did something wrong.	Ukatwa jupajj jan walinak luräna.
No one needs to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I’m really sad.	Chiqpachansa llakitaw jikxatastxa.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He understood that perfectly.	Jupajj uk sum amuyäna.
No one knows what to do.	Janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkiti.
This wasn’t the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkänti.
A rebuild is required.	Mä wasitat lurañaw wakisi.

Really, really, it is.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.

He didn't know he could do that.	Ukham luraspa uk janiw yatkänti.

Maybe it’s worth doing.	Inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.

He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
And there will be something, there will be.	Ukat kunas utjani, utjani.
That doesn’t mean that.	Ukax janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
But that didn't hurt.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jan walinak lurkänti.
It has nothing to do with me now.	Jichhajj janiw nayampejj kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He didn't know.	Jupajj janiw yatkänti.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t remember that.	Janiw uk amtaskti.
I want to see that.	Nayax uk uñjañ munta.
He’s just like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw.
There is no need to do this.	Uka lurañajj janiw wakiskiti.
Or anywhere, for that matter.	Jan ukax kawkhans, uka tuqitxa.

And so on and so forth.	Ukat ukham ukat ukham.
It doesn’t exist.	Janiw ukax utjkiti.
He didn't want to go there.	Jupajj janiw uka cheqar sarañ munkänti.
I guess that’s not what you want.	Nayax amuyta, janiw ukax kuntix jumax munkta ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
Two days, maybe three .	Pä uru, inas kimsa uru .
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
The boy was very happy.	Uka waynax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
You have yourself.	Jumax juma pachpaw utji.
He saw it there himself, he says.	Jupa pachpaw ukan uñjäna, sasaw saraki.
That doesn’t mean you actually use it.	Ukax janiw chiqpachapuni apnaqañ sañ munkiti.
I didn't say anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns siskti.
And that is how he felt.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj jikjjatasïna.

What's the reason.	Kunas kunatsa.
Always has and always will.	Sapa kutiw utji ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
There was no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkänti.
That’s it, that’s all it says.	Ukax ukhamawa, ukax taqpach sañ muni.
I never liked to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj gustkituti.
They’re still worth it.	Jupanakax wali askiwa.
He didn't have anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
Today, that is not the case.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw uk lurañ munkti.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
But there is room for improvement.	Ukampis jukʼamp sum lurañaw utji.
This is a character.	Akax mä jaqiwa.

He is a bad guy .	Jupajj jan wali jaqewa .

I had no idea how to do that.	Ukham lurañatakejj janiw amuykayätti.
I don't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
But while it was happening, it was still .	Ukampis ukham luraskäna ukhajja, wali .
He did it for the guy.	Jupajj uk luräna.
Now I know about you.	Jichhajj jumat yattwa.
He didn't feel that way right now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj ukham amuyaskänti.
And it never was.	Ukat janipuniw utjkänti.
None of that, really.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
It didn’t feel like it.	Janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
Now I don't know exactly what happened.	Jichhajj kunas ukajj pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
But he was still alone that night.	Ukampis uka arumax wali sapakiw jikxatasïna.
Or he thought he meant himself.	Jan ukajj jupa pachpaw sañ muni sasaw amuyäna.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I want to know .	Nayax yatiñ munta .
I had no idea how I felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk janiw kuns amuykayätti.
I really need some help.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa yanaptʼa munta.
It’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti.
One day you will too.	Mä urux ukhamarakiw jumax lurasma.

But it will take a while.	Ukampis mä jukʼa tiempow pasani.
That’s the thing.	Ukax ukhamawa.
He didn't know where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk janiw yatkänti.
So it doesn't mean much more than that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sañ munkiti.
They have the same kind of day.	Jupanakax pachpa kasta uruw utji.
It’s just that .	Ukax ukhamakiw .
I just want one.	Mä sapakiw munta.
He didn't need to.	Jupajj janiw wakiskänti.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj wal munäna.
You have nothing to do here.	Jumax janiw kuna lurañas akan utjkiti.
But it worked for me.	Ukampis nayatakix wali askiwa.
He loved me so much.	Jupajj walpun nayar munäna.
That, and away.	Uka, ukat jaya.
Or maybe the other way around.	Jan ukajj inas yaqha tuqitxa.
And he’s a nice guy.	Ukat jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
I don't know any more.	Janiw jukʼamp yatkti.
But no one did it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
It will do just fine.	Ukajj wali sumwa lurani.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
You know what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.
It felt like that.	Ukajj ukham jikjjatasïna.
I want to do better.	Nayax juk’amp sum lurañ munta.
That has nothing to do with me.	Ukajj janiw nayampejj kuna lurañas utjkiti.
And another day.	Ukat yaqha uru.
But he refused to believe it.	Ukampis janiw uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
He was a good speaker.	Jupajj sum parlañ yatïna.
And why should he do that.	Ukat kunatsa ukham lurañapa.
So he went and started using it.	Ukatwa saräna ukat uka apnaqañ qalltäna.
They were still they were.	Wali wali wali.
He had nothing to do.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
That’s the first thing he needs to do.	Ukaw nayraqat lurañapa.
Definitely why not.	Chiqpachansa kunatsa jan ukhamäki.
No, it’s too soon.	Janiwa, wali jank’akiw.
He wanted it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk munäna.
But it still felt good.	Ukampis wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
You know what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk jumajj yatisktawa.
He didn't want to see it.	Jupajj janiw uk uñjañ munkänti.
It’s not a big deal.	Janiw kuna jach’a lurañas utjkiti.

A little bit of a bad thing.	Mä juk’a jan wali.
So you can do that many times.	Ukhamajj walja kutiw ukham lurasma.
That’s what’s happening.	Ukaw pasaski.
He was just .	Jupajj ukhamakiw .
It was already like that.	Nayratpach ukhamänwa.
He didn't quite know why.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa sum yatkänti.
Very far indeed.	Wali jaya chiqpachansa.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurañ munkti.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
And I really can't say anything.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kuns sañjamäkiti.
Not much can be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw sinti lurañax utjkaspati.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
But it’s not like that for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
I have done the wrong thing.	Nayajj jan walinak lurawayta.
He didn't want her.	Jupajj janiw jupar munkänti.
It really didn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunas wakiskänti.
Now, he’s very happy.	Jichhax, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
That is not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he’s definitely done it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw lurawayi.
Not the case now.	Janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
I don't think so at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa ukham amuykti.
They had no one.	Jupanakajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
But he didn’t know what else to do.	Ukampis janiw kuns yaqha lurañap yatkänti.
And then immediately again.	Ukat ukat jankʼakiw wasitat.
But he never said no.	Ukampis janipuniw janiw siskänti.
Everything is worth it.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa.
But it can never last that long.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham jaya tiempojj utjkaspati.
I don’t agree with all of them.	Janiw taqpach jupanakar iyaw siskti.

I want him bad enough.	Nayajj jupar jan walpun munta.
But that's not what you want.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuntï munkta ukajj ukhamäkiti.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He’s always in town.	Jupax sapa kutiw markanx utji.
He started doing it.	Uk lurañwa qalltäna.
He really didn’t care.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns lurkänti.
That’s right now.	Ukax jichhax.
I did that for myself.	Nayatakix ukham lurawayta.
Everything is good for me .	Taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa .
It was never the case.	Janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I might agree with that.	Nayajj inas uk iyaw sista.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
This is impossible to do.	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
A wonderful book.	Mä suma libro.

But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

No, no, he has none.	Janiwa, janiwa, jupax janiw khitis utjkiti.
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.
Something really, really great.	Kunas chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa jach’a.
I want to drive.	Nayax auto apnaqañ munta.
There is a need to do it.	Kuna lurañas wakisi.
So it goes by itself.	Ukhamajj jupa pachpaw saraski.
Everyone likes to do that.	Taqiniruw ukham lurañax gusti.
I told him the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jupar sista.
That is not what we need.	Ukajj janiw jiwasajj wakiskiti.

He was so happy to see me.	Nayar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I’m serious about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali amuyumpiw amuyta.

I've been feeling that way.	Nayajj ukham amuyasta.
I couldn't understand anything more.	Janiw jukʼamp kuns amuykayätti.

There is no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
He knows exactly what he wants to do.	Kun lurañsa muni uk sum yati.

He doesn't want to know.	Jupajj janiw yatiñ munkiti.
So there is no need not to do it.	Ukhamajj janiw jan lurañajj wakiskiti.
What he meant was obvious.	Kuntï sañ munkäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
And that’s just how it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamakiw utji.
It didn’t mean anything, really.	Janiw kuns sañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti.

Or, you can do it yourself.	Jan ukajj, juma pachpaw uk lurasma.

There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.

This was the first time that had happened.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw ukham pasäna.

He never knew anything like that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham kunsa yatkänti.
So there was nothing there.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
It is not the case	Janiw ukhamäkiti .
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I didn't want that.	Nayajj janiw ukham munkayätti.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkituti.
That’s what he wanted.	Ukhamaw jupajj munäna.
It felt pretty much the same.	Ukajj niya ukhamarakiw jikjjatasïna.
I want one right now.	Nayax jichhax mä munta.
There isn’t any.	Ukanx janiw utjkiti.
Why, I wonder? 	¿Kunatsa, sasaw jisktʼasta?
It happened remarkably quickly.	Ukajj wali muspharkañ jankʼakiw pasäna.
He didn’t know, he says.	Jupax janiw yatkänti, sasaw saraki.
That’s what it is.	Ukax ukax ukhamawa.
It’s not impossible.	Janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
he thought to himself.	sasaw amuyäna.
I think it was.	Ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
I don’t want to say that.	Nayax janiw ukham sañ munkti.
He immediately started talking about it.	Ukat jankʼakiw uka toqet parltʼañ qalltäna.
They mean nothing to you.	Jupanakax janiw jumatakix kuns sañ munkiti.
He really loves her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar munasi.
No, it really wasn’t.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
I didn't think so.	Janiw nayajj ukham amuykayätti.
I didn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkti.
That made it even bigger.	Ukaw jukʼamp jachʼa luräna.
He really knows about me.	Chiqpachansa jupax nayat yati.
Why is he a guy? 	¿Kunatsa jupajj?
He began to go there regularly.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uka markar sarañ qalltäna.
But a little bit.	Ukampis mä jukʼa.
It doesn't need to be.	Janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He didn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurkänti.
A little bit, maybe.	Mä juk’a, inas.
I’m hoping for that.	Nayax ukham suyt’askta.
This is with me.	Akax nayamp chikaw utji.
No one did what he did better.	Kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk janiw khitis jukʼamp sum lurkänti.
And he wasn’t like that at all.	Ukat jupax janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkänti.
And now this.	Ukat jichhax aka.
You’re a great guy.	Jumax mä jach’a jaqiwa.
He knows I won't.	Janiw ukham lurkäti uk jupajj sum yati.
I know what you can do with yourself.	Kunsa juma pachpa lurasma uk nayajj yattwa.
So far that’s been good.	Jichhakamax ukax wali askiwa.

That's a good thing for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
I don't want to see it, she said.	Janiw uñjañ munkti, sasaw jupajj säna.
There will be some time.	Mä juk’a pachaw utjani.

Nothing like it used to be.	Janiw kunas nayrax ukhamäkänti.
He seemed a little more polite.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jukʼamp suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I don’t want that.	Janiw nayax uk munkti.
And he didn’t know what that meant.	Ukat janiw kunas ukax sañ munki uk yatkänti.
I have no idea how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw amuykti.
He’s in love with her.	Jupax jupampiw wal munasi.
It goes really fast.	Chiqpachansa wali jankʼakiw pasaski.
But it just feels like it.	Ukampis jichhakiw ukham amuyasi.
No one understood why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis amuykänti.
But I understand it.	Ukampis nayax amuyasta.
That's what he did best.	Ukaw jupajj jukʼamp sum luräna.
He just walked away.	Jupajj ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
And he’s not like that.	Ukat jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to make sure of that.	Nayax uka tuqit sum uñjañ munta.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But he knew what he had to do.	Ukampis kun lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
I don’t know anything.	Nayax janiw kuns yatkti.
I don't want to know more about it.	Janiw uka toqet jukʼamp yatiñ munkti.
He’s alone though.	Jupax sapakiw ukampis.
But the point was that the point was pretty clear.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa, uka tuqitxa wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
He was devastated and .	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna ukat .
I think he was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.

A little bit of everything, really.	Mä juk’a taqi kuna, chiqpachansa.

There was nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
I don’t know, maybe.	Janiw yatkti, inas.
How did it do that .	Kunjamatsa ukajj ukham luräna .
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don't believe that.	Nayajj janiw uk creykti.
This is very obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw amuyasi.
I don't believe that at all.	Nayajj janiw uk kuns creykti.
Big, big, too big.	Jach’a, jach’a, sinti jach’a.

I don't like that very much.	Ukajj janiw sinti gustkituti.
I want something .	Nayax mä kuns munta .

I'm not doing that right now.	Nayajj janiw jichhajj ukham lurkti.

Is it necessary to do so.	¿Ukham lurañajj wakisispati.
That’s good, of course.	Ukax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
I always understand.	Nayax sapa kutiw amuyasta.
He didn't want anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa munkänti.
But he refused to go.	Ukampis janiw sarañ munkänti.
He was always doing something.	Jupax sapa kutiw kuns luraskäna.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Janiw kunas pasani uk yatkti.
He began to speak again.	Jupajj wasitatwa parlañ qalltäna.
But I don't know why.	Ukampis janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
He obviously didn’t want to talk.	Jupax qhanaw jan parlañ munkänti.
And that is unique.	Ukat ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
He said it was true.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw sasaw säna.
And that’s a good thing.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa.
I don’t want one.	Janiw nayax mä munkti.
I know that's a good thing.	Nayajj uk sum yatta.
But not beyond me.	Ukampis janiw nayat sipansa.

That’s what it takes.	Ukaw wakisispa.
I like this one very much.	Nayatakix akax wali askiwa.
He went before me.	Jupaw nayat nayrajj saräna.
Now he didn't want to know.	Jichhajj janiw yatiñ munkänti.
Now I know that is not the case.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti uk yattwa.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
I don’t know anything about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns yatkti.
This happened to them three times.	Ukajj kimsa kutiw jupanakar pasäna.
It’s not like that with me.	Nayampejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Nothing he doesn’t know.	Janiw kunas jupax jan yatkiti.
But that's what I like.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
He knew what that felt like.	Kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasïna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He had always wanted it.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk munäna.
He didn’t want to tell them anything, of course.	Janiw jupanakar kuns yatiyañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
That makes them feel good.	Ukaw jupanakar sum jikjjatasi.
I haven’t seen them.	Janiw jupanakar uñjkti.
So there was nothing too surprising about it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas uka toqet sinti muspharkañ utjkänti.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
That’s actually, it is.	Ukax chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.

Everything is clear so far.	Taqi kunas qhanaw jichhakamax utji.

He had never done this before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurkänti.

I think you understand.	Nayax amuyta jumax amuyta.
And that’s what I like about it.	Ukat ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Now I see that.	Jichhajj uk uñjta.
What about money.	Kunas qullqi tuqitxa.
But there was nothing else to do.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
I need to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sum yatïna.
Good, bad, bad.	Suma, jan wali, jan wali.
A better word actually.	Mä juk’amp suma aru chiqpachansa.
It happened fairly quickly.	Ukajj mä jukʼa jankʼakiw pasäna.
He says he always drinks.	Jupax sapa kutiw umañ munta sasaw saraki.
So that's a good thing.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali askiwa.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It’s still worth it now.	Jichhax wali askiwa.
I’ve always done that.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukham lurawayta.
I’m always learning or doing something.	Nayax sapa kutiw yatiqañ munta jan ukax kuns lurañ munta.

But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
There is nothing, and then .	Janiw kunas utjkiti, ukat ukat .
It has never happened before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham utjkänti.
He saw her yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw jupar uñjäna.
It happened very quickly.	Ukajj wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
You are the first person .	Jumax nayrïr jaqiwa .
That is completely unnecessary.	Ukajj taqe kunas janiw wakiskiti.

You can do that anywhere.	Kawkhansa ukham lurasma.
You’re called the best.	Jumax wali suma satawa.

This will happen too.	Akax ukhamarakiw pasani.
I don’t want to see him again.	Janiw wasitat jupar uñjañ munkti.
In fact, he did.	Chiqpachansa, ukham luräna.
This is a very interesting one.	Akax wali askiwa.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
Everything is going so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw saraski.
There’s no reason why it can’t be done.	Janiw kunatsa jan lurañjamäkiti.
It’s not good for anyone.	Janiw khitirus askïkiti.
But something happened.	Ukampis kunas pasäna.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
But it never happened before.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham nayrajj utjkänti.
It just happened to happen.	Ukax ukhamakiw pasäna.
He said he didn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkti sasaw säna.

But there is nothing beyond that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa janiw kunas utjkiti.

No, do something with that attitude.	Janiwa, uka amuyumpiw kuns lurañama.

He knew that sort of thing.	Jupajj uka kasta yatïna.
I didn’t say anything to anyone.	Janiw khitirus kuns siskti.
And he walked with me.	Ukat jupax nayamp chikaw sarnaqäna.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
And that’s obviously not going to do it.	Ukat ukax qhanaw jan lurañapa.
He really wants to see her.	Chiqpachansa jupar uñjañ muni.
Everything is faster as well.	Taqi kunas juk’amp jank’akiw ukhamaraki.
That didn't make sense to him.	Ukajj janiw jupar amuykänti.
He’s done it again.	Jupax wasitat lurawayi.
He says he wants to stay with me.	Jupax nayamp qhiparañ munta sasaw saraki.
That’s what he did.	Ukaw jupajj luräna.

He definitely saw it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk uñjäna.

You can do better yourself than that.	Ukat sipansa juma pachpaw jukʼamp sum lurasma.
And that’s what I like right now.	Ukat ukax jichhax nayatakix wali askiwa.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.

He did her a favor.	Jupajj jupar sum luräna.
Of course, he said.	Chiqpachansa, sasaw säna.
That’s good, she said.	Ukax wali askiwa, sasaw jupax säna.
And he saw something strange.	Ukat mä jukʼa muspharkañ uñjäna.
I didn’t understand much until now.	Jichhakamax janiw sinti amuykayätti.
There is no such thing.	Janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.

Whatever he said.	Kunas sasaw säna.

Nothing was necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskänti.

I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.

He didn't really notice anything.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun kuns amuyaskänti.

That's pretty much what he said.	Ukajj niya ukhamwa jupajj säna.

He moved her away.	Jupaw jupar yaqha cheqar sarjjäna.

He didn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyäna.

He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.

Something only he can do.	Kuntï jupa sapakiw luraspa.
But it was clear what was going to happen.	Ukampis kunas pasani ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

No coffee for you.	Janiw kuna café jumatakix utjkiti.
And it worked for me.	Ukat nayatakix wali askiwa.
He knew about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yatïna.

I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He’s obviously done this before.	Jupax qhanaw nayrax ukham luratayna.
But it’s really worth it.	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
But he said he didn't want to see any more.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp uñjañ munkti sasaw säna.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

Everyone is not like that.	Taqinipuniw janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was virtually nonexistent.	Jupajj niya janiw khitis utjkänti.
But he didn't know all of that.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanak yatkänti.
What do you know that he doesn't?.	¿Kunsa yatta, jupajj janiw uk yatkiti?.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

He wanted to see things from a new perspective.	Jupajj machaq amuyumpiw kunsa uñjañ munäna.
He said he was really.	Chiqpachansa sasaw säna.
You think you know what you want.	Jumax kuntï munkta uk yatisktawa sasaw amuyta.

Then he started again.	Ukat wasitatwa qalltäna.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
He was not himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpa ukhamäkänti.
Now it was like that.	Jichhajj ukhamänwa.

There’s nothing to do here.	Janiw kunas akan lurañax utjkiti.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas utjkaspati.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
So he said that.	Ukatwa jupajj uk säna.
That’s of course.	Ukax chiqpachansa.
But I don't remember exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum amtaskti.
It’s still a pretty big one.	Wali suma jach’a.

He was curious about it.	Jupajj uka toqet yatiñ wal munäna.
I don’t want to talk to him.	Janiw jupamp parlañ munkti.

He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He didn't want to say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.

He understood it, but he had been reluctant to do it before.	Jupajj uk sum amuyäna, ukampis nayrajj janiw ukanak lurañ munkänti.

He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
I want a drink.	Nayax mä umañ munta.
It’s not necessary.	Janiw wakiskiti.
He immediately falls in love with her.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupamp wal munasi.
So he didn't do these things.	Ukhamajj janiw ukanak lurkänti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it’s not, it’s not.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.

He wants two days.	Jupax pä uruw muni.
He was feeling sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He is still in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasi.
So it was that it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

He knows he doesn't know everything.	Jupajj janiw taqe kun yatkiti uk sum yati.
I enjoyed doing it.	Uk lurañajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
I'm not sure who said that first.	Khitis nayraqat ukham säna uk janiw sum yatkti.
He doesn’t know where he is.	Jupax janiw kawkhans jikxatasi uk yatkiti.
This will happen many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasani.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw pasäna.
I don’t want to say anything about it.	Janiw nayax ukat kuns sañ munkti.
I didn’t think I needed to do it all the time.	Janiw sapa kuti lurañax wakiskiti sasin amuyirïkti.
But now this.	Ukampis jichhax aka.
But that turned out not to be the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
That’s what’s here.	Ukaw akan utji.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
He never said how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uk janipuniw siskänti.
I really, really hope so.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa ukham suyt’askta.
Well, it really is.	Ukhamawa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
He wanted to know more.	Jupax wali sum yatiñ munäna.
I don't know now.	Jichhajj janiw yatkti.
He was doing something a little wrong.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jan walinak luraskäna.
He was the only one who understood.	Jupa sapakiw amuyasïna.
But it wasn't there.	Ukampis janiw ukajj utjkänti.
I’ve seen it all.	Nayax taqi ukanak uñjta.
I want to go every day.	Nayax sapa uruw sarañ munta.
What he doesn’t mean.	Kuntï jupax jan sañ munkiti.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
I think he will.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukham lurani.
So we are the same.	Ukhamajj jiwasajj ukhamarakiw.
He’s more of a villain.	Jupax juk’amp mä jan wali jaqiwa.
So great and.	Ukham jach’a ukat.
But that is not the case here.	Ukampis janiw akan ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I know at least that.	Nayajj mä jukʼa uk yattwa.
I think it might do the same for you somehow.	Nayax amuyta, kunjamatsa jumatakix ukhamarakiw luraspa.
Once, twice, three times.	Mä kuti, pä kuti, kimsa kuti.
He was doing it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanak luraskäna.
I know that's it.	Nayajj uk yattwa.
But very often, it’s not.	Ukampis wali walja kutiw, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He never existed.	Janipuniw jupajj utjkänti.
I wasn’t the only one.	Janiw nayajj ukhamäkänti.
And another one.	Ukat yaqha.
I really don’t know everything.	Chiqpachansa janiw taqi kun yatkti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kunas lurañax utjkiti.
This is obviously not the case.	Ukajj qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
I feel that way myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham amuyasta.
That happened a long time ago.	Ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
It happened once.	Mä kutiw ukham pasäna.
He didn't want to, but that was it.	Jupajj janiw munkänti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
I know that’s not the case.	Nayax yattwa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t know what to do here.	Nayax janiw kuns akan lurañax yatkti.
You better this.	Jumax akax juk’amp askiwa.
But he is a different person.	Ukampis jupajj yaqha jaqewa.
I hope to do that one day.	Mä urux ukham lurañ suyt’askta.
Really, really big.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa jach’a.
You have to be very careful.	Wali amuyumpiw lurañama.
He never said anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns siskänti.
But I didn't want to talk.	Ukampis janiw parlañ munkayätti.
I understand all of this.	Taqi ukanak sum amuyta.
I’m going to say that.	Nayax ukham sañ munta.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
You really have to do your own thing.	Chiqpachansa juma pachpaw kuns lurañama.
He wanted to do it so badly.	Jupajj walpun lurañ munäna.
He had no idea what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk janiw amuykänti.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
So it kind of happened to him.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa tiempow jupar pasäna.
In this case it is not.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
How he dealt with her.	Kunjamsa jupamp sarnaqäna.
He didn't quite know where.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus sum yatkänti.
You already know that.	Jumax nayratpachaw uk yatta.
In this regard.	Uka tuqitxa.
It doesn't mean anything more.	Janiw jukʼamp kuns sañ munkiti.
They are not here.	Jupanakax janiw akan utjkiti.
That’s what it’s all about.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa.
I say that a lot myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham wal sista.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And he wanted to do that.	Ukat ukham lurañwa munäna.
I hope that comes soon.	Ukajj jankʼakiw purini sasaw suytʼaskta.

It’s not like that, it’s not.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
So that was the thing.	Ukhamajj ukajj ukhamänwa.
But he thought it was.	Ukampis jupax ukhamänwa sasaw amuyäna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
This is a long one.	Akax mä jaya jaqiwa.
It feels more powerful.	Juk’amp ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t understand it.	Janiw uk amuykayätti.
He moved very quickly.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
He’s faster though.	Jupax juk’amp jank’akiw ukampis.
And this is good enough.	Ukat akax wali askiwa.
He always wanted more.	Sapa kutiw jukʼamp munäna.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
Nobody likes him.	Janiw khitis jupar gustkiti.
There is nothing necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
But there will be something.	Ukampis kunas utjani.
I don't know what to say.	Janiw kunjamatsa siskti.
It's a good thing	Ukajj wali askiwa .
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

He actually did it.	Chiqpachansa uk luräna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
I am still happy to see that.	Uk uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
Today, he refuses to talk about it.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw uka toqet parlañ munkiti.
And now it’s time.	Ukat jichhax pachaw purini.
No one knows why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luräna.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham uñjkti.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
That’s the big guy.	Ukax jach’a jaqiwa.
I'm saying something.	Nayax kuns sista.

He knew how to do it well.	Jupajj sumwa uk lurañ yatïna.
He doesn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkiti.
That’s how I want to see you again .	Ukhamwa jumar wasitat uñjañ munta .
It happened every time.	Sapa kutiw ukham pasäna.
He had no idea what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna ukajj janiw kunsa amuyaskänti.

No one wanted to know about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet yatiñ munkänti.
You always say that.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham sañ yatta.
He means everything to me.	Jupax nayatakix taqi kun sañ muni.

But he refused to believe it.	Ukampis janiw uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
Not about that.	Janiw uka tuqitxa.
He wants to eat.	Jupax manq’añ muni.
Or so it was.	Jan ukajj ukhamänwa.
That’s a good thing for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
Very soft, very soft! 	¡Wali llamp’u, wali llamp’u!

He wanted to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañwa munäna.
And he was very upset.	Ukat jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
There is no .	Ukax mä .

No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I'm glad I didn't see that.	Uk jan uñjasajj wal kusista.

He knew better than that.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
He’s always been such a nice guy.	Jupax nayratpachaw ukham suma waynax jikxatasïna.
I see things the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw kuns uñjta.
There is no such thing.	Janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.
He doesn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uka jan walinak lurañ munkiti.
And why is he alone? 	Ukat ¿kunatsa jupa sapaki?
Not again, either.	Janiw mayampsa.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He knows exactly what he wants to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa muni uk sum yati.
Everything and nothing.	Taqi kunas ukat janiw kunas.

Nothing to do, really.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
That first day in town.	Uka nayrïr urux markanx ukham jikxatasïna.
That’s what’s doing it.	Ukaw uk luraski.
Not so much, he says.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, sasaw saraki.
I’ve done three.	Nayax kimsa lurawayta.
I always think so.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukham amuyta.
That happened with us.	Ukajj nanakamp chikaw pasäna.

You always do it.	Jumax sapa kutiw uk lurasma.
No, he didn’t do that.	Janiwa, janiw ukham lurkänti.
It's a bit of a .	Ukajj mä jukʼa .
But I really don’t understand anything.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kuns amuykti.
It was, and he knew it.	Ukhamänwa, ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
Many, many.	Walja, walja.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
But you have to do what you want.	Ukampis kuntï munkta uk juma pachpaw lurañama.
And he behaved well.	Ukat jupax wali sum sarnaqäna.
He doesn't want to do nothing with you.	Jupajj janiw jumamp jan kun lurañ munkiti.
Not the other way around.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa.
He moved to the city.	Jupajj uka markaruw sarjjäna.
And it wasn’t like that.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkänti.
So he can't exist.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj utjkaspati.
There', that's it.	Ukan', ukax ukhamawa.
Over and over and over again.	Walja kutiw walja kuti ukat walja kuti.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
That’s it, of course.	Ukax ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
It's never very early.	Janipuniw wali nayrajj utjkiti.
But something made him like that.	Ukampis kunas jupar ukham luratayna.
He did the driving.	Jupaw auto apnaqañ luräna.
I don't understand why he treated her so badly.	Kunatsa jupar jan walinak luräna uk janiw amuykti.
And he didn't mean it.	Ukat janiw uk sañ munkänti.
I don’t know anything, really.	Janiw kuns yatkti, chiqpachansa.
In this case it wasn’t.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkänti.

He didn't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkänti.
I don’t understand them.	Janiw jupanakar amuykti.
No, it’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is a nice coffee shop.	Ukanx mä suma café ukaw utji.

And it’s kind of .	Ukat mä kasta .
Always, obviously, not never.	Sapa kutiw, qhanaw, janiw janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t really know how.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapuni kunjamsa uk yatkti.
This was clearly not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
he thought to himself.	sasaw amuyäna.
And that’s a good thing.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa.
In one sense it was.	Mä tuqitxa ukhamänwa.
I don't know why.	Janiw kunatsa yatkti.
It’s really like that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He loves you so much.	Jupajj jumat walpun munasi.
That’s what I think.	Ukhamaw nayax amuyta.
He’s not a nobody.	Jupax janiw khitis.

I’ve done exactly that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayta.
He didn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
But there is nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
So it happened many times.	Ukhamajj walja kutiw ukham pasäna.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.
He is a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqewa.
I’m really, really excited.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I see myself doing this many times.	Naya pachpaw ukham walja kuti luraskta uk uñjta.
I would have to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañaw wakisispa.
I already realize that.	Nayax niyaw uk amuyasta.
Or the day before.	Jan ukajj nayrïr uru.
That's not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
So that’s it .	Ukhamajj ukhamawa .
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
He chose not to do so.	Jupajj jan ukham lurañwa amtäna.
I want to see it for myself.	Naya pachpaw uk uñjañ munta.
That’s the way it is now.	Jichhax ukhamawa.
But it felt like that.	Ukampis ukham amuyasïna.

And it’s not the right thing to do.	Ukat janiw ukax askïkiti.
You know the type.	Jumax uka kasta yatisktawa.
I understand all of this.	Taqe ukanak sum amuyta.
I realized this myself.	Naya pachpaw uk amuyayäta.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
But it hasn’t worked for me yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax nayatakix askïkiti.
Really and truly .	Chiqpachansa ukat chiqpachapuniw .
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn’t exist.	Jupax janiw utjkiti.
He is very happy to see her.	Jupar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
Not what he wanted.	Janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukat sipansa.
But that happened in the middle of the day.	Ukampis ukajj chika uruw pasäna.
He would have no choice.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.
He knows how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk jupajj sum yati.
He will love it.	Jupax walpun munasini.
But never again.	Ukampis janipuniw mayampsa.
Good kind of thing.	Suma kasta.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna.
Maybe it's .	Inas ukajj .
He didn’t want to.	Janiw munkänti.
This is better that it’s worth it.	Akax juk’amp askiwa ukax wali askiwa.
He’s a very happy man, too.	Jupax wali kusisit jaqiwa, ukhamaraki.
But now, obviously, he is.	Ukampis jichhax, qhanaw, jupax ukhamawa.
I don't want to help him.	Janiw jupar yanaptʼañ munkti.
You don’t want to see me.	Janiw nayar uñjañ munkti.
But that is not possible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
You may need some help.	Inas mä jukʼa yanaptʼa wakischispa.
I have no idea what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw amuykti.
I don’t want to see it.	Janiw uñjañ munkti.
He didn’t know what anyone wanted.	Jupax janiw kuntï khitis munkäna uk yatkänti.
I know, of course.	Nayax yattwa, chiqpachansa.
That’s right, he thought.	Ukhamawa, sasaw amuyäna.
He never said that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk siskänti.
I have the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw utjitu.
I wonder about it myself.	Naya pachpaw uka toqet jisktʼasta.
And today.	Ukat jichhürunakanxa.
The cost of doing this is .	Uka lurañatakix qullqix .
He will love me very much.	Jupajj nayarojj wal munasini.
I didn’t see anyone.	Janiw khitirus uñjkti.
It doesn’t happen to me.	Janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
And that’s not good enough.	Ukat ukax janiw askïkiti.
I'm not a.	Nayax mä.
Something needs to be done.	Kunas lurañaw wakisi.
Therefore, he said.	Ukatwa ukham säna.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s not like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
No one wanted him.	Janiw khitis jupar munkänti.
In fact, he was.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamänwa.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw akan jikxatastxa.
It’s going to be a slow motion.	Ukhamaw saraski.
It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.	Janiw wakiskiti, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
It wasn't necessary.	Janiw ukajj wakiskänti.

He thought it was true.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sasaw amuyäna.

But you weren't like that.	Ukampis janiw jumajj ukhamäkänti.
He said he didn’t do it.	Janiw uk lurkti sasaw säna.
That’s the case with this.	Ukhamaw aka tuqitxa.

But that is by no means the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
I can’t believe it .	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti .
He feels alone.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasi.
He didn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa sum yatkänti.
He is very careful about what he says.	Kuntï siski uk wali amuyumpiw luraski.
Or, so he thought.	Jan ukajj, ukhamwa amuyäna.
But he didn't know that.	Ukampis janiw uk yatkänti.
And of course he was.	Ukat chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
Of course I know.	Chiqpachansa nayax yattwa.
It was obvious that he really wanted to.	Jupajj cheqapuniw munäna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
The young man refused.	Uka waynax janiw iyaw siskänti.

I never thought he was that type of person.	Janipuniw jupajj uka kasta jaqëkaspas ukham amuyirïkti.
He seemed to be someone else.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He couldn't drive home.	Jupajj janiw autot utar sarañ puedkänti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

But he wanted to do that.	Ukampis ukham lurañwa munäna.
I don't want to rush you.	Janiw nayajj jumar jankʼak lurañ munkti.

I’m rather excited about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx juk’amp kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

But the big money isn’t.	Ukampis jach’a qullqix janiw.
Twice he refused.	Pä kutiw jan munkänti.

But that wasn't the case for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakejj ukhamäkänti.
That’s what he did.	Ukaw jupajj luräna.
But he didn't realize it.	Ukampis janiw amuyaskänti.
He wasn't, but he was.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa.
I didn’t really want to know.	Janiw chiqpachansa uk yatiñ munkayätti.
It doesn’t have to be done.	Janiw lurañax wakiskiti.

You can’t do it with anyone.	Janiw khitimpis lurañjamäkiti.
But that is clearly not the case.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
That was the case for me.	Nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
He didn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykänti.
There will be plenty of time to do this.	Uk lurañatakix walja tiempow utjani.

Everything and nothing.	Taqi kunas ukat janiw kunas utjkiti.
You know about it.	Jumax uka tuqit yatisktawa.
I’m really devastated.	Chiqpachansa wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I mean drinking in it.	Ukan umañ sañ munta.
He didn't want much of it, anyway.	Jupajj janiw sinti ukanak munkänti, kunjamatsa.
He was a very happy guy.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
So far, I haven’t been able to do that.	Jichhakamax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
But it’s not the same.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
But no one knew that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk yatkänti.
What’s a little bit.	Kunas mä juk’a.
Me, of sorts.	Nayax, mä kasta.
I did nothing yesterday.	Nayajj janiw qharürojj kuns lurkti.
He’s very excited.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
No, of course not.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was with us the whole time.	Jupajj taqe tiempow nanakamp chika sarnaqäna.
Never, really.	Janiw kunapachas, chiqpachansa.
There was nothing to do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
What he says about you.	Kunsa jupajj jumat siski.
So he went there.	Ukatwa jupajj ukar saräna.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know what it takes to do this.	Uk lurañatakix kunas wakisi uk sum yatta.
That’s never necessary.	Ukax janipuniw wakiskiti.
He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
He bought her several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jupar alasïna.
He’s definitely .	Jupax chiqpachapuniw .
It’s been a good time for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa.
I know very well how and where.	Kunjamsa ukat kawkhansa wali sum yatta.
I never liked that.	Ukajj janipuniw nayarojj gustkituti.
But there is nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkiti.
The sooner he did it, the better.	Jupajj jankʼak lurkäna ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
So he did it.	Ukatwa jupajj luräna.
He didn't want that much.	Jupajj janiw ukham sinti munkänti.
And what is that thing you do.	Ukat kunas uka kuns lurañama.
I don’t want to do that.	Janiw nayax ukham lurañ munkti.
I mean really big.	Chiqpachansa jach’a sañ munta.
That’s what I like about it.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
How beautiful beautiful beautiful.	Kunjamsa wali suma suma suma.
Or you can do something first.	Jan ukajj nayraqat kuns lurasma.
I just feel like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw jikxatastxa.
I am so happy with the results.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk uñjasajj wal kusista.
Or why it happened.	Jan ukajj kunatsa ukham pasäna.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
he said, smirking.	sasaw säna.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
That’s exactly what you get.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jikxatasi.
I know, we were.	Nayax yattwa, jiwasax ukhamänwa.
He has no one else.	Jupajj janiw khitis utjkiti.
I want to buy another one.	Nayax yaqha alañ munta.
You are everything to me.	Jumax nayatakix taqi kunas.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
It didn’t mean that, but it was.	Janiw ukham sañ munkänti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
So it's not that easy.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Wherever he went.	Kawkirus saräna.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I know exactly where he is now.	Jichhajj kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
This is interesting, of course.	Akax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
It’s like that for me.	Nayatakix ukhamawa.
I really think so.	Chiqpachansa ukham amuyta.
But that happened.	Ukampis ukajj pasäna.
I see this in a negative light.	Nayax jan wali amuyumpiw uk uñjta.
I want that to stay.	Nayax uka qhiparañ munta.
He knew nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkänti.
But that's not the right thing to do.	Ukampis ukajj janiw askïkiti.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
It hasn't been that way for a while.	Mä qawqha tiempojj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s worth it, it’s worth the money.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukax qullqix wali askiwa.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
But that was it .	Ukampis ukajj ukhamänwa .
But it doesn't work for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
He wants to see her alone again.	Jupajj wasitat sapak uñjañ muni.
You have a soft sleep or something.	Jumax mä llamp’u ikiñan jan ukax kunas.
I know that's a good thing.	Nayajj uk sum yatta.
It’s a nice sight.	Ukax wali askiwa.
What it says is that.	Kuntï siski ukajj ukhamawa.
He loved her so much.	Jupajj jupar wal munäna.
And what did he say.	Ukat kuns säna.
I understand you better.	Nayajj jumat jukʼamp sum amuyta.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax wali sum lurani.
That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
Almost the same thing happened again.	Niya ukhamarakiw wasitat pasäna.
I like this one very much.	Nayatakix akax wali askiwa.
I am looking forward to that day.	Uka uru suytʼaskta.
He wanted to tell them.	Jupanakar yatiyañ wal munäna.
He felt it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
I don’t know how to do anything else.	Janiw yaqha lurañ yatkti.
You think about this.	Jumax aka tuqit amuyta.
But it almost went away.	Ukampis niya ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
I know what you want.	Nayax yattwa kuntix jumax munkta uk.
That’s a good thing for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
I know he did that.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luratayna.
But he wants to do more.	Ukampis jukʼamp lurañwa muni.
They are not .	Jupanakajj janiw .
He could not do it alone.	Jupajj janiw sapaki uk lurañ puedkänti.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He’ll do something.	Jupaw kuns lurani.
And he thought he had found something.	Ukat kuns jikjjatasta sasaw amuyäna.
I never liked him.	Janipuniw jupar gustkituti.
I don’t want anything.	Janiw kuns munkti.
Every day, really.	Sapa uru, chiqpachansa.
He was obviously excited.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
That's not necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
It really needs to be done.	Chiqpachansa ukax lurañaw wakisi.
He never asked for anything.	Janipuniw kunsa mayïna.
But that just happened.	Ukampis ukajj jichhakiw pasäna.
That wasn’t the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
He arrived today.	Jupax jichhüruw purini.
You just have to .	Jumax ukhamakiw .
I want to do something.	Nayax mä kun lurañ munta.
Should do for a couple of days.	Mä pä uruw lurañapa.
It will be available for a while.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw utjani.
It wasn’t a good night.	Janiw mä suma arumax utjkänti.
It needs to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisi.
He didn't want her to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañap munkänti.
There was not much time left .	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti .
He didn't think about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet amuykänti.
This is very frequent.	Ukax wali sapa kutiw utji.
I feel just as good.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw wali sum jikjjatasta.
He is better the other way around.	Jupajj yaqha tuqitxa jukʼamp askiwa.
He was reluctant, but he did it anyway.	Jupajj janiw munkänti, ukampis kunjamatsa uk luräna.
It’s really like that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
But he wants nothing to do with her.	Ukampis janiw jupamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
What can you do?	Kunsa lurasma.
So very, very sad.	Ukhamajj wali, wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I really don’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkti.
He was so happy he loved her so much.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jupar wal munäna.
Again, longer, longer.	Wasitat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow jukʼamp tiempo.
This was not the case before.	Ukajj janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
