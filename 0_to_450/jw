I read it and loved it.	Aku maca lan tresna iku.
But let’s get straight to it here.	Nanging ayo langsung ing kene.
We thought he would come after, but he came before.	Kita panginten dheweke bakal teka sawise, nanging dheweke teka sadurunge.
At least he knew where he was.	Paling ora dheweke ngerti ngendi dheweke.
He works almost every day of the year.	Dheweke kerja meh saben dina ing taun.
He also lives nearby.	Dheweke uga manggon ing cedhak.
Almost no one noticed.	Meh ora ana sing weruh.
Hopefully today hasn’t come yet.	Muga-muga dina iki durung teka.
This is a new day.	Iki dina anyar.
If you like.	Yen sampeyan seneng.
I don’t.	Kula ora.
He stood, slightly away, and watched.	Dheweke ngadeg, rada adoh, lan nonton.
This is another.	Iki ana liyane.
Maybe it’s something else entirely.	Mungkin iku soko liyane tanggung.
Don’t waste your time and money to get the wrong person.	Aja mbuwang wektu lan dhuwit kanggo njupuk wong sing salah.
You can’t get out of yourself, you can’t.	Sampeyan ora bisa metu saka dhewe, sampeyan ora bisa.
Not tomorrow and not tomorrow either.	Ora sesuk lan ora esuk uga.
That’s if they do.	Sing yen padha nindakake.
It is the end of the month.	Wis akhir sasi.
I hope you can help me.	Muga-muga sampeyan bisa nulungi aku.
I’m not really sure.	Aku ora yakin tenan.
You can try.	Sampeyan bisa nyoba.
I’m sure he’s got it.	Aku yakin dheweke wis entuk.
Not very good.	Ora apik banget.
But some other people don’t know what other people are talking about.	Nanging sawetara wong liya ora ngerti apa sing diomongake wong liya.
He had never seen or heard of it.	Dheweke ora tau katon utawa krungu saka iku.
Don’t listen.	Aja ngrungokake.
We will be staying with my parents for some time.	Kita bakal tetep karo wong tuwane kanggo sawetara wektu.
I can’t say what happens next.	Aku ora bisa ngomong apa sing kedadeyan sabanjure.
Or maybe there is.	Utawa biyen ana.
What a wonderful night.	Bengi sing apik banget.
He doesn’t do it all the time.	Dheweke ora nindakake kabeh wektu.
Read on.	Maca ing.

I like water.	Aku seneng banyu.
He now hopes to write more in the future.	Dheweke saiki ngarep-arep bisa nulis luwih akeh ing mangsa ngarep.

He knew that he had agreed to the action.	Dheweke ngerti yen dheweke wis setuju karo tumindak kasebut.
She looked like she was going to cry.	Dheweke katon kaya arep nangis.
But there was a catch.	Nanging ana sing nyekel.
So obviously it could be both.	Dadi jelas bisa dadi loro.
But one thing is for sure.	Nanging siji bab wis mesthi.
In almost everything about it.	Ing meh kabeh babagan.
Take her down.	Njupuk dheweke mudhun.
I have to close.	Aku kudu nutup.
I’m a little young for that.	Aku rada enom kanggo sing.
And after all in.	Lan sawise kabeh ing.
But if it was easy, everyone would do it.	Nanging yen gampang, kabeh wong bakal nindakake.
She went to the front door and opened it.	Dheweke lunga menyang ngarep lawang lan mbukak.
The minute it happened, he was right.	Ing menit sing kedadeyan, dheweke bener.
There are many other problems that occur.	Ana akeh masalah liyane sing kedadeyan.

One, two, three.	Siji, loro, telu.
Who cares.	Sing peduli.

Something went wrong.	Ana sing salah.
He will talk to you about it.	Dheweke bakal ngomong karo sampeyan babagan iki.

This will not surprise anyone who knows him.	Iki ora bakal kaget sapa wae sing ngerti dheweke.
Do that one.	Apa siji sing.
However, it wasn’t like that this week.	Nanging, ora kaya ngono minggu iki.

Watch the reader.	Nonton maca.
She could barely hear him.	Dheweke meh ora krungu dheweke.
Now we show this clearly.	Saiki kita nuduhake iki kanthi jelas.

You use it if you want.	Sampeyan nggunakake yen sampeyan pengin.
This is a one month period.	Iki wektu siji sasi.
But here we are.	Nanging ing kene kita padha.
The others just laughed.	Sing liyane mung ngguyu.
You may not be happy with me, but you may not be happy with me.	Sampeyan ora bisa seneng karo sampeyan, nanging ora seneng karo aku.
The woman was angry.	Wong wadon nesu.
We will definitely stay again.	Kita mesthi bakal tetep maneh.

He was also right.	Dheweke uga bener.
It’s about what they do.	Iku babagan apa sing ditindakake.
It takes time to think.	Sampeyan butuh wektu kanggo mikir.

There was nothing for a few days on our backs.	Ora ana apa-apa kanggo sawetara dina ing mburi kita.
I accept this.	Aku nampa iki.
Of course he went back to her.	Mesthi dheweke bali menyang dheweke.

She went to the park with a small dog.	Dheweke lunga menyang taman karo asu cilik.
Life is easier now.	Urip saiki luwih gampang.
Now, don’t go anywhere.	Saiki, aja menyang ngendi wae.
I don’t think anyone can !.	Aku ora mikir sapa bisa!.

Just watch to see her !.	Mung nonton kanggo ndeleng dheweke!.
Let them believe that they are better off where they are.	Ayo padha percaya yen dheweke luwih apik ing ngendi dheweke.
Most you try.	Paling sampeyan nyoba.
That will let him live.	Sing bakal nglilani dheweke urip.
I have been using it for years.	Aku wis nggunakake kanggo taun.
She was amazing, and amazing.	Dheweke apik tenan, lan apik tenan.

She arrived at lunch time.	Dheweke teka ing wektu nedha awan.
And thank you again.	Lan matur nuwun maneh.
Not like the desired place.	Ora kaya papan sing dikarepake.
If only he could kill it.	Yen mung dheweke bisa mateni.
And it’s just down the road.	Lan iku mung mudhun dalan.
She dropped out of school.	Dheweke mandheg sekolah.

Now that you are here you have to stay.	Saiki sampeyan kene sampeyan kudu tetep.

Children learn to read easily.	Bocah-bocah sinau maca kanthi gampang.
It has been so beautiful.	Wis ayu banget.
And he asked her to sit with him.	Lan dheweke njaluk dheweke lungguh karo dheweke.

But not for long.	Nanging ora suwe.
She walked straight into the room.	Dheweke mlaku langsung menyang kamar.
Please make your own at home.	Mangga nggawe dhewe ing omah.
