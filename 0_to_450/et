The thing is, we can't know.	Asi on selles, et me ei saa seda teada.

That's it, you're done.	See on kõik, olete valmis.

It just didn't work for me.	See lihtsalt ei teinud seda minu jaoks.

I was happy about that.	Olin selle üle hea meel.

Everything was fine.	Kõik oli hästi.

And he does.	Ja ta teeb seda.
He never told me about it.	Ta ei rääkinud mulle sellest kunagi.

And you know why.	Ja sa tead, miks.

We have to be.	Me peame olema.
She wants something to eat.	Ta tahab midagi süüa.
He said it was.	Ta ütles, et on.
I understand, but no one can help.	Saan aru, aga keegi ei saa aidata.
Mom said she likes it.	Ema ütles, et talle see meeldib.
You only have one life.	Sul on ainult üks elu.
He had said too much.	Ta oli liiga palju öelnud.
I don't want to do anything to him anymore.	Ma ei taha temaga enam midagi teha.
It was just that it worked for me.	See oli lihtsalt nii, et see töötab minu jaoks.
It is well known that this is the case.	See, et see nii on, on hästi teada.

It is hard.	See on raske.

I did exactly what you said.	Ma tegin täpselt seda, mida sa ütlesid.
If you like someone, tell them.	Kui sulle keegi meeldib, ütle talle.
And this is for you.	Ja see on teie jaoks.
There is a lot to do.	Teha on palju.
Apparently he was.	Ilmselt ta oli.
I think you are.	Ma arvan, et sa oled.
You can do that too.	Saate seda ka teha.

He comes and goes as he pleases.	Ta tuleb ja läheb, kuidas tahab.
He's a beautiful boy.	Ta on ilus poiss.
I have to go and you too.	Mina pean minema ja sina ka.
Maybe he doesn't like him very much either.	Võib-olla ta ei meeldi ka endale eriti.
Not much, but a little.	Mitte palju, aga natuke.
Come here now.	Nüüd tule siia.
You can't go out tonight.	Sa ei saa täna õhtul välja minna.
But we are ourselves.	Aga me oleme meie ise.

No one can be so happy.	Keegi ei saa olla nii õnnelik.
Really, he couldn't believe he hadn't seen it before.	Tõesti, ta ei suutnud uskuda, et ta polnud seda varem näinud.

I'm nobody and everything.	Ma pole keegi ja kõik.
I finally saw my father.	Lõpuks nägin oma isa.
And then talked about this and that.	Ja siis rääkis sellest ja sellest.
No one really knew what was going on.	Keegi ei teadnud tegelikult, mis toimub.
She's not feeling well.	Ta ei tunne end hästi.
In fact, they were here.	Tegelikult olid nad siin.
Like this morning.	Nagu täna hommikul.
Not the way you think it should be.	Mitte nii, nagu sa arvad, et see peaks olema.
I would never do that.	Ma ei teeks seda kunagi.
He said something.	Ta rääkis midagi.
But we have no time or space for that.	Meil pole selleks aga aega ega kohta.
Even if he wanted to.	Isegi kui ta tahaks.
I won't tell you what to say anymore.	Ma ei ütle teile enam, mida öelda.

I'm not coming to your house or doing it for you.	Ma ei tule sinu koju ega tee seda sinu eest.

Please.	Palun.
I'm not making the same mistake anymore.	Ma ei tee enam sama viga.
I don't think that's bad.	See pole minu arvates halb.
Probably both are interested.	Tõenäoliselt on mõlemad huvitatud.
There is only one problem.	On ainult üks probleem.
But it was no longer the life he wanted.	Kuid see polnud enam elu, mida ta tahtis.
He has three days to live.	Tal on elada kolm päeva.
I can't get it.	Ma ei saa seda.
Not a man.	Mitte mees.
It almost set him off.	See pani ta peaaegu minema.
And we're not there.	Ja meid pole seal.
I didn't like it.	See mulle ei meeldinud.
I'm glad it's you, not me.	Mul on hea meel, et see oled sina, mitte mina.
Certainly not his.	Tema oma kindlasti mitte.
The old woman lives alone.	Vana naine elab üksi.
And that is all.	Ja see on kõik.
Maybe you're too old for me.	Võib-olla oled sa minu jaoks liiga vana.
And maybe it is.	Ja võib-olla on.
He couldn't believe what he saw.	Ta ei suutnud uskuda, mida ta nägi.
Not what it gets after he's done.	Mitte sellest, mis sellest saab pärast seda, kui ta on lõpetanud.
I'm pretty sure of that.	Olen selles üsna kindel.
I never understood exactly what to expect.	Ma ei saanud kunagi täpselt aru, mida oodata.
That will be my job.	Sellest saab minu töö.
He went to him.	Ta läks tema juurde.

I told him we'd get through this afternoon.	Ütlesin talle, et saame pärastlõunal läbi.
I really want to see that.	Seda tahaks väga näha.

More work is needed.	Vajab veel tööd.
I know he does.	Ma tean, et ta teab.
He knows we don't have it.	Ta teab, et meil seda pole.
Now it's gone.	Nüüd on see läinud.
Make it three.	Tee sellest kolm.
I can't today.	Ma ei saa täna.
This can be a big mistake.	See võib olla suur viga.
Apparently it wasn't him.	Ilmselt polnud see tema.
I didn't even know what it was.	Ma isegi ei teadnud, mis see on.
Everyone said so.	Kõik ütlesid nii.
She looked good, she said.	Ta nägi hea välja, ütles naine.
But now almost everything is going.	Aga nüüd läheb peaaegu kõik.
I fully understand that.	Ma saan sellest täiesti aru.
He was never the same person again.	Ta polnud enam kunagi sama inimene.
He would do it.	Ta teeks seda.
I've been before.	Olen varem olnud.
They said something.	Nad ütlesid midagi.
We won't talk about it anymore.	Rohkem me sellest ei räägi.
But his father doesn't want him to do that.	Tema isa aga ei taha, et ta seda teeks.
Maybe even before that.	Võib-olla isegi enne seda.
It's definitely not good.	Kindlasti pole see hea.
You're just doing your job.	Sa lihtsalt teed oma tööd.
Finally he told him.	Lõpuks ta ütles talle.

He wanted her and only her.	Ta tahtis teda ja ainult teda.
It wasn't even last year.	See polnud isegi eelmisel aastal.
And not as much as you can.	Ja mitte palju, kui saate.
What should we do? 	Mida me peaksime tegema?

He gave it away.	Ta andis selle ära.
It couldn't be good.	See ei saanud olla hea.
He could never say no again.	Ta ei suutnud kunagi öelda, enam mitte.
Not someone he doesn't even know.	Mitte keegi, keda ta isegi ei tunne.
But this is not the only option.	Kuid see pole ainus võimalus.

Maybe even today.	Võib-olla isegi täna.
It was really hard for me.	See oli minu jaoks tõesti raske.
Good day!	Head päeva!
And so is he.	Ja nii ka tema.
His mother.	Tema ema.
This was not the case before.	Varem see nii ei olnud.
And then he was gone.	Ja siis ta oli läinud.
That's what he thought.	Nii ta seda arvas.
But it can't be.	Aga see ei saa olla.
Even then, he couldn't get out.	Isegi siis ei saanud ta välja.
He didn't have to be there.	Ta ei pidanud meid seal olema.

He's here with us.	Ta on siin meiega.
He never knew exactly why.	Ta ei teadnud kunagi täpselt, miks.

Here's mine.	Siin on minu oma.
There's nothing he can do.	Ta ei saa midagi teha.
That was too hard to say.	Seda oli liiga raske öelda.
Sounds pretty simple.	Tundub üsna lihtne.
He just had no idea where.	Tal lihtsalt polnud aimugi, kus.

I didn't think it was a big deal.	Ma ei arvanud, et see on suur asi.
We've been there before.	Oleme seal varem käinud.
What he did seemed.	See, mida ta tegi, tundus.
But this is simply not true.	Aga see lihtsalt pole tõsi.
He finally came to him.	Lõpuks tuli ta tema juurde.
He has it.	Tal on see.
I would too.	Mina oleksin ka.
He left a few days ago.	Ta lahkus paar päeva tagasi.
But he seems to like it.	Aga tundub, et talle meeldib.
We did well.	Meil läks hästi.
I don't know what else.	Ma ei tea, mida veel.
You know he'll be right back there.	Sa tead, et ta tuleb kohe sinna tagasi.
He couldn't believe what he was doing.	Ta ei suutnud uskuda, mida ta just tegi.
He had to do it now.	Ta pidi seda nüüd tegema.
I didn't really like it.	Mulle see eriti ei meeldinud.
He's a "can handle" man.	Ta on "saab hakkama" mees.
Maybe it's known.	Võib-olla on see teada.
I just don't do it.	Ma lihtsalt ei tee seda.
What now? 	Mis nüüd?
he thought.	ta arvas.
It is still today.	See on ka praegu.
But he wanted to.	Aga ta tahtis.
He wanted more, much more.	Ta tahtis rohkem, palju rohkem.
No one was sure, so he didn't say anything.	Keegi polnud kindel, nii et ta ei öelnud midagi.
I'm his mother now.	Olen nüüd tema ema.
I can't tell him.	Ma ei saa talle öelda.
I was happy for him.	Mul oli tema üle hea meel.
It's not easy.	See ei ole lihtne.
What happened after.	Mis juhtus pärast.
He was ready for me.	Ta oli minu jaoks valmis.
Or he came to him.	Või tuli ta tema juurde.
Tell me, tell me.	Ütle mulle, ütle mulle.
He's good enough, and he's definitely good enough.	Ta on piisavalt hea ja ta on kindlasti piisavalt hea.
This year more the same.	Sel aastal rohkem sama.
I don't think it's there yet.	Ma arvan, et see pole veel seal.
And so we do nothing.	Ja nii me ei tee midagi.
But here he comes to you.	Kuid siin ta tuleb teie juurde.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Ma tahan olla homme parem.
If we don't get it now, we'll never get it.	Kui me seda praegu ei saa, ei saa me seda kunagi.
It wasn't even beautiful.	See polnud isegi ilus.
I'm interested in you.	Ma olen sinust huvitatud.
It was human.	See oli inimene.
I have it.	Mul on see.
How he came back.	Kuidas ta tagasi tuli.
And there was nothing.	Ja polnud midagi.
But a person should be who he really is.	Kuid inimene peaks olema see, kes ta tegelikult on.
We never talk.	Me ei räägi kunagi.
Wait a minute.	Oota veel.
Not with me.	Mitte minuga.
I think he wanted to.	Ma arvan, et ta tahtis.
Everyone was quite surprised.	Kõik olid üsna üllatunud.
I think he was.	Ma arvan, et ta oli.
It's in the morning.	See on hommikul.
And not nearly enough.	Ja mitte peaaegu piisavalt.
He told him he could do it himself.	Ta ütles talle, et saab seda ise teha.
But he wasn't.	Aga ta ei olnud.
I wasn't really sure if it was good or not.	Ma ei olnud tõesti kindel, kas see oli hea või mitte.
He doesn't need to.	Tal pole vaja.
That's a good feeling.	See on hea tunne.
I wanted so.	Ma nii tahtsin.
I want to talk to him.	Ma tahan temaga rääkida.
But it doesn't have to be.	Aga see ei pea olema.
Everyone knew that.	Kõik teadsid seda.
That was the case with me.	Minuga oli nii.
I have one.	Mul on üks.
He doesn't want to go.	Ta ei taha minna.
There must be something we can do.	Peab olema midagi, mida me saame teha.
But it just wasn't him.	Aga see lihtsalt polnud tema.
.	.
He should have gone.	Ta oleks pidanud minema.
And not anymore.	Ja enam mitte.
Nobody knows what happened there.	Keegi ei tea, mis seal juhtus.
I don't want to say anything.	Ma ei taha midagi öelda.
It all stayed with him.	Kõik see jäi tema sisse.
I was human.	Ma olin inimene.
There was no one there.	Seal polnud kedagi.
There is no life in it at all.	Selles pole üldse elu.
Then it's over.	Siis saab see läbi.
I'm sure you're tired.	Olen kindel, et sa oled väsinud.
I was too.	Mina olin ka.
Don't go back !.	Tagasi ei lähe!.
I hope so, for my own sake.	Loodan nii, enda pärast.
What did he just say?	Mida ta just ütles?
You don't do that.	Sa ei tee seda nii.
I know that.	Ma tean seda.
She looked happy and so beautiful.	Ta nägi välja õnnelik ja nii ilus.
But there is something else.	Kuid on veel midagi.
Maybe he wants to talk.	Võib-olla tahab ta rääkida.
It had to be good.	See pidi hea olema.
I know that is the case.	Ma tean, et see on nii.
Or does.	Või teeb.
This car is too heavy for the road.	See auto on tee jaoks liiga raske.
We are a couple.	Oleme paar.
He didn't want to say.	Ta ei tahtnud öelda.
That is difficult to say at an early stage.	Seda on raske varakult öelda.
He just recognized me.	Ta lihtsalt tundis mu ära.
So they don't.	Nii et nad ei tee seda.
You too, man.	Sina ka, mees.
But he didn't do the same.	Kuid ta ei teinud sama.
I know him.	Ma tean teda.
He went for it.	Ta läks selle peale.
But don't be so sure.	Aga ära ole nii kindel.
I'm just not going to do that.	Ma lihtsalt ei kavatse seda teha.
Just me.	Lihtsalt mulle.
I've had a mistake.	Mul on olnud viga.
My old friend.	Minu vana sõber.
So I'm not sure what that does.	Nii et ma pole kindel, mida see teeb.
I've seen it today.	Olen seda täna näinud.
I don't think anyone did.	Ma ei usu, et keegi ei teinud.
He must have.	Tal peab olema.
Please, just do it.	Palun, lihtsalt tee seda.
I'm glad you're here.	Mul on hea meel, et sa siin oled.
I shouldn't be here at all.	Ma ei peaks siin üldse olema.
Mom was so beautiful.	Ema oli nii ilus.
I had it right there.	Mul oli see just seal.
What more can be said.	Mis saab veel öelda.
Send him away.	Saada ta minema.
Does he like money.	Kas talle meeldib raha.
I told you where.	Ma ütlesin sulle, kus.
But now is not the time.	Aga praegu pole aega.
Then he spoke again.	Siis ta rääkis uuesti.
He would be there.	Ta oleks seal.
But don't do anything.	Aga ära tee midagi.
I only need a little bit.	Mul on vaja ainult natuke.
But no, definitely not.	Aga ei, seda kindlasti mitte.
That's what our money does.	Seda teeb meie raha.
They said it with him and alone.	Nad ütlesid seda koos temaga ja üksi.
He thought it was a good thing.	Ta arvas, et see on hea asi.
That's how it is now.	Nii see praegu on.
Do it again.	Teeb seda uuesti.
He had heard it all before.	Ta oli seda kõike varem kuulnud.
I'm not the only one who can do that.	Ma pole ainuke, kes seda teha suudab.
You just don't have time.	Teil lihtsalt pole aega.
i don't have to talk.	ma ei pea rääkima.
But that's not all.	Kuid see pole ainult see.
It is not as they cannot or as they have not done before.	See ei ole nii, nagu nad ei saaks või nagu nad pole varem teinud.
Everything was as it should be.	Kõik oli nii nagu pidi.
He knew so much.	Ta teadis nii palju.
But he did not know that he had left.	Aga ta ei teadnud, et ta lahkus.
He had a father.	Tal oli isa.
He was very busy.	Ta oli väga hõivatud.
Off with you now.	Nüüd sinuga ära.
That may be true.	Võib olla tõsi.
But he did not know why the woman left.	Kuid ta ei teadnud, miks naine lahkus.
I know it was you.	Ma tean, et see olid sina.
So who knows.	Nii et kes teab.
I go back all the time.	Ma lähen kogu aeg tagasi.
But it was good for him.	Aga see oli talle hea.
Before you can have someone what you do then.	Enne kui sul võib olla keegi, mida sa siis.
I thought you were me.	Ma arvasin, et sa oled mulle.
Come down.	Tule alla.
We will be fine.	Saame hakkama.
Then he saw him.	Siis nägi ta teda.
Not at all.	Üldse mitte seda.
Nothing but that.	Mitte midagi peale selle.
I just don't feel that much anymore.	Ma lihtsalt ei tunne seda enam nii palju.
No one knew what to say, and in fact he had nothing to say.	Keegi ei teadnud, mida öelda, ja tegelikult ei olnud tal midagi öelda.
But only for you.	Aga ainult sinu jaoks.
There is no mistake here.	Siin pole viga.
I don't think it's over.	Ma arvan, et see pole läbi.
They are against it.	Nad on selle vastu.
I'm a teacher.	Ma olen õpetaja.
He works there.	Ta töötab seal.
He didn't want to leave.	Ta ei tahtnud lahkuda.
It had to be.	See pidi olema.
But I'd better go.	Aga mul oleks hea minna.
It seems to work for us.	Tundub, et see töötab meie heaks.
It didn't tell him anything.	See ei öelnud talle midagi.
And it's time.	Ja aeg on.
I said that.	Ma ütlesin seda.
But we probably shouldn't.	Aga me ilmselt ei peaks.
And something else.	Ja veel midagi.
Like yesterday.	Nagu eile.
I wanted to talk to you.	Tahtsin sinuga rääkida.
I've never been there before.	Ma pole kunagi varem seal käinud.
And he came in and asked for it.	Ja ta tuli sisse ja küsis seda.
I don't think he really likes it.	Ma arvan, et see talle väga ei meeldi.
I don't see how we can do that.	Ma ei saa aru, kuidas me seda teha saame.
I'll be right back.	Olen kohe tagasi.
He looked again.	Ta vaatas uuesti.
Very good really.	Väga hea tõesti.
Where does he want to go?	Kuhu ta minna tahab.
Maybe he didn't know that either.	Võib-olla ta ei teadnud ka seda.
Nobody likes him.	Ta ei meeldi kellelegi.
They just weren't for me.	Need lihtsalt polnud minu jaoks.
There will be another.	Tuleb veel üks.
What have you done?	Mida sa teinud oled.
No, one didn't.	Ei, üks ei teinud.
There is nothing to do now.	Nüüd pole midagi teha.
They weren't even really my parents.	Nad polnud isegi tegelikult mu vanemad.
They are just like you and me.	Nad on täpselt nagu sina ja mina.
But this is the first.	Kuid see on esimene.
I'm the only one who can do that.	Ma olen ainuke, kes seda teha saab.
He really wanted to be there.	Ta tahtis väga seal olla.
But that's not really much.	Kuid see pole tegelikult palju.
Then it finally happened.	Siis lõpuks see juhtus.
In fact, the feeling is even better.	Tegelikult on tunne isegi parem.
It does it.	See teeb seda.
It's very simple.	See on väga lihtne.
He didn't even have to say that.	Ta ei pidanud isegi seda ütlema.
You have to do it.	Sa pead seda tegema.
I want it to be his.	Ma tahan, et see oleks tema oma.
I'm not coming back.	Ma ei tule tagasi.
Too bad your father couldn't come.	Kahju, et su isa ei saanud tulla.
Dad's money, it's gone.	Isa raha, see on läinud.
It would be easy for you.	Sul oleks lihtne.
The house is a house.	Maja on maja.
But he knew too much.	Kuid ta teadis liiga palju.
It doesn't tell us anything.	Ei räägi meile midagi.
We'll see.	Eks näis.
We couldn't have done it.	Me poleks saanud hakkama.
He's the one.	Tema on see üks.
So he was happy.	Nii et ta oli õnnelik.
It was probably nothing.	See polnud ilmselt midagi.
He's my friend.	Ta on mu sõber.
It will definitely be soon.	See on kindlasti varsti.
You know how to do it now.	Sa tead, kuidas seda nüüd teha.
Dad didn't tell him anything.	Isa ei öelnud talle midagi.
He saw him now, he couldn't do anything about it.	Ta nägi teda praegu, ta ei saanud selle vastu midagi teha.
That was what came through.	See oli see, mis tuli läbi.
I don't know exactly what's going on.	Ma ei tea täpselt, mis toimub.
Nobody saw anything.	Keegi ei näinud midagi.
I don't want to talk anymore.	Ma ei taha rohkem rääkida.
Your father is an old man.	Su isa on vana mees.
Everything is working well.	Kõik töötab hästi.
He's doing very well.	Ta saab väga hästi hakkama.
But there were problems.	Aga probleeme oli.
Nobody likes him.	Ta ei meeldi kellelegi.
Maybe we should talk together.	Võib-olla peaksime koos rääkima.
That was so true.	See oli nii tõsi.
Not very bad.	Mitte väga halb.
Now he didn't even do it for him.	Nüüd ei teinud seda enam isegi tema jaoks.
My parents too.	Minu vanemad ka.
He was good at that, too.	Ta oli ka selles hea.
You don't eat.	Sa ei söö.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Kas olete kindel, et soovite seda teha?
Not alone.	Mitte üksi.
He must have gotten over it.	Ta on vist sellest üle saanud.
My father knows the way.	Mu isa teab teed.
Say what you want about it.	Ütle, mida sa selle kohta tahad.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Ta ei saanud tema heaks midagi teha.
Maybe there really was something here.	Võib-olla tõesti oli siin midagi.
He knew there would be time.	Ta teadis, et selleks oleks aega.
Then he fell asleep again.	Siis jäi ta uuesti magama.
Now he was gone.	Nüüd oli ta läinud.
Very good really.	Väga hea tõesti.
I can't do that.	Ma ei saa seda teha.
Strongly agree.	Täiesti nõus.
He's definitely an interesting man.	Ta on kindlasti huvitav mees.
I did not know.	Ma ei teadnud.
There's nothing here for him.	Tema jaoks pole siin midagi.
You always know where it is.	Sa tead alati, kus see on.
But they're out there.	Aga nad on seal väljas.
It will not be easy.	See ei saa olema lihtne.
I feel like they didn't.	Mul on tunne, et nad seda ei teinud.
They will never do it again.	Nad ei tee seda enam kunagi.
I don't know exactly why.	Ei tea täpselt miks.
But now they can't just talk about it.	Kuid nüüd ei saa nad sellest enam lihtsalt rääkida.
I'm glad he's with me.	Mul on hea meel, et ta on minuga koos.
But not like you.	Aga mitte nagu sina.
That was bad enough.	See oli piisavalt halb.
I think that will be a very good thing.	Ma arvan, et see saab olema väga hea asi.
But you before.	Aga sina enne.
I want to do that too.	Ma tahan ka seda teha.
But that was too much for me to understand.	Kuid seda oli minu jaoks liiga palju, et aru saada.
We will never know.	Me ei saa kunagi teada.
If there is more left, there is nothing.	Kui rohkem jääb, pole midagi.
But now it's you.	Aga praegu oled see sina.
That's probably true.	See on ilmselt tõsi.
What happened happened.	Juhtus, mis juhtus.
It's not here or there.	Seda pole siin ega seal.
Maybe he's busy.	Võib-olla on ta hõivatud.
I want to know what he said.	Ma tahan teada, mida ta ütles.
Very good actually.	Väga hea tegelikult.
To talk about it.	Et sellest rääkida.
But certainly not more.	Aga kindlasti mitte rohkem.
All this.	Kõik see.
He's coming here.	Ta tuleb siia.
Are you with us ?.	Kas sa oled meiega?.
We have no people.	Meil pole inimesi.
That's pretty hard, isn't it?	See on päris raske, kas pole?
Why are you here?	Miks sa siin oled?
I was as surprised as you.	Ma olin sama üllatunud kui sina.
Much could be said about this.	Selle kohta võiks öelda palju.
They don't really know anything.	Nad ei tea tegelikult midagi.
If he could tell him who he was.	Kui ta saaks talle öelda, kes ta on.
He was very happy.	Ta oli väga õnnelik.
It was hard to go.	Raske oli minna.
This is never the case.	See pole kunagi nii.
No one can leave.	Keegi ei saa lahkuda.
The man didn't seem to hear her.	Näis, et mees ei kuulnud teda.
It probably did a lot more than that.	Tõenäoliselt tegi see peale palju rohkem.
It's really quite simple.	See on tõesti üsna lihtne.
You know that now.	Sa tead seda nüüd.
I thought it was so beautiful.	Ma arvasin, et see oli nii ilus.
That doesn't seem to be the case anymore.	Tundub, et see pole enam nii.
Then he came back.	Siis tuli tagasi.
There was nothing like that here.	Siin polnud midagi sellist.
It's a hard thing.	See on raske asi.
One was waiting.	Üks oli oodanud.
I wanted to tell him that for myself.	Ma tahtsin talle seda enda jaoks öelda.
But that's not a problem.	Aga see pole probleem.
Whether or not.	Kas või mitte.
Then it will come back.	Siis tuleb see tagasi.
Everything was as always.	Kõik oli nagu alati.
More things came.	Asju tuli juurde.
Time was up.	Aeg oli läbi.
It's just not my business.	See pole lihtsalt minu asi.
You can handle it.	Saate sellega hakkama.
We really have.	Meil on tõesti.
You have done a good job here.	Olete siin head tööd teinud.
Everything he said was true.	Kõik, mida ta ütles, oli tõsi.
Won't do it anymore.	Ei tee enam.
But there is another interesting thing.	Kuid on veel üks huvitav asi.
He told you about me.	Ta rääkis sulle minust.
They don't need you.	Nad ei vaja sind.
So this is one option.	Nii et see on üks võimalus.
He would have wanted to do that someday.	Ta oleks tahtnud seda kunagi teha.
Too many people.	Liiga palju inimesi.
I've seen things.	Olen asju näinud.
He didn't say anything about how it happened.	Ta ei öelnud midagi, kuidas see juhtus.
I am healthy and happy.	Olen terve ja õnnelik.
You can do so much with it.	Saate sellega nii palju ära teha.
That should not be the case, but it is.	Nii see ei peaks olema, aga nii see on.
It just couldn't be done.	Seda lihtsalt ei saanud teha.
Simple is better.	Lihtne on parem.
I know that and you know it.	Mina tean seda ja sina tead seda.
It's not what it used to be.	See pole enam see, mis varem.
Nobody.	Mitte keegi.
But this is never the case.	Kuid see pole kunagi nii.
But you should go.	Aga sa peaksid minema.
My father was old.	Mu isa oli vana.
I'm this woman.	Mina olen see naine.
That's his job.	See on tema töö.
I hope he doesn't get it.	Loodan, et ta ei saa seda.
You knew him.	Sa teadsid teda.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Võib-olla polnud see tema.
That is all we can do.	See on kõik, mida saame teha.
It is not known exactly where he went.	Kuhu ta täpselt läks, pole teada.
His father died early.	Tema isa suri varakult.
I didn't want to do that.	Ma ei tahtnud seda teha.
We don't have it here.	Meil pole seda siin.
It does almost exactly that.	See teeb peaaegu täpselt seda.
To do that, he needed to eat.	Selleks oli tal vaja süüa.
It's a bit of the same thing.	See on natuke sama asi.
Maybe even more.	Võib-olla isegi rohkem.
I want to talk about it.	Ma tahan sellest rääkida.
Maybe he's not there.	Võib-olla pole teda seal.
That's the only reason he's here.	See on ainus põhjus, miks ta siin on.
I've had both for several years.	Mul on mõlemad olnud juba mitu aastat.
He's having a little.	Tal läheb natuke.
I'm going up.	Ma lähen üles.
He's for you.	Ta on sinu jaoks.
There is no possibility at all.	Pole üldse võimalust.
That you never do that.	Et sa seda kunagi ei tee.

He was there.	Ta oli seal.
Very good.	Väga hea.
That is very true.	See on väga tõsi.
It was completed today.	Täna sai see valmis.
Or his father.	Või tema isa.
I won't say more.	Rohkem ma ei ütle.
He knew what he was doing.	Ta teadis, mida teeb.
Looks like they actually did it.	Näib, et nad on sellega tegelikult hakkama saanud.
I can't.	Ma ei saa mitte.
I want to be more than a wife and mother.	Ma tahan olla rohkem kui naine ja ema.
Nothing but that.	Ei midagi peale selle.
He did this all his life.	Seda ta tegi kogu oma elu.
I did it, he told himself.	Ma tegin seda, ütles ta endale.
You can't have him.	Sa ei saa teda.
It is not known why this happened.	Miks see juhtus, pole teada.
I didn't like it at all.	See ei meeldinud mulle üldse.
I can't help her.	Ma ei saa teda aidata.
It wasn't hard.	See ei olnud raske.
And so it is, so much so.	Ja seda on nii, nii palju.
How he came to her.	Kuidas ta tema juurde tuli.
Even if you are not.	Isegi kui sa ei ole.
He could never see anything of it.	Ta ei saanud kunagi sellest midagi näha.
I wouldn't have.	Ma poleks saanud.
Same as me.	Sama mis mina.
Here's what he says.	Siin on see, mida ta ütleb.
I know too.	ma tean ka.
He was everything to me.	Ta oli minu jaoks kõik.
Who did it?	Kes on seda teinud?
That was good for him.	See oli temaga hea.
It was nothing to him.	See polnud talle midagi.
But how he said it.	Aga kuidas ta seda rääkis.
A lot happened.	Seda juhtus palju.
If you want, please eat.	Kui tahad, palun söö.
Also great.	Ka suur.
We're not done yet.	Me ei ole veel läbi.
He's a good friend.	Ta on hea sõber.
Everyone is surprised.	Kõik on üllatunud.
As if he had seen something.	Nagu ta oleks midagi näinud.
He'll be right here.	Ta tuleb kohe siia.
I'm glad no one saw it.	Mul on hea meel, et keegi seda ei näinud.
It was too easy.	See oli liiga lihtne.
You can never be completely sure.	Sa ei saa kunagi olla täiesti kindel.

It's easy.	See on lihtsalt.
I didn't really want to know.	Ma ei tahtnud tegelikult teada.
he asked.	ta küsis.
He finally died.	Lõpuks ta suri.
I do not understand.	ma ei saa aru.
I didn't think it was easy.	Ma ei arvanud, et see oli lihtsalt.

I didn't say anything more.	Ma ei öelnud rohkem midagi.
You are a better man.	Sa oled parem mees.

And we should.	Ja me peaksime.
He died soon after.	Varsti pärast seda ta suri.
One we've seen.	Üks, mida oleme näinud.
So much.	Nii et palju.
In the end, he thought he understood.	Lõpuks arvas ta, et sai aru.
It couldn't be done that easy.	Seda ei saanud teha, nii lihtne.
We were not alone.	Me ei olnud üksi.
It was over soon.	Varsti oli see läbi.
When something happens, it happens.	Kui midagi juhtub, siis see juhtub.
Not even his mother.	Isegi mitte tema ema.
But it's still not the same.	Aga see pole ikka sama.
If he knows what to do, he should tell us.	Kui ta teab, mida teha, peaks ta meile ütlema.
I'm just too tired right now.	Ma olen praegu lihtsalt liiga väsinud.
This is a very simple matter.	See on väga lihtne asi.
We had it before and we'll get it again.	Meil oli see varem ja saame uuesti.
But in the end, he said it himself.	Aga lõpuks ütles ta seda ise.
He had a chance.	Tal oli võimalus.
They knew it as soon as it happened.	Nad teadsid seda kohe, kui see juhtus.
Probably a lot.	Ilmselt palju.
Both on and off.	Nii sisse ja välja.
And he knows why.	Ja ta teab, miks.
I wanted you to know that.	Ma tahtsin, sa tead seda.
But he doesn't really know what he wants.	Kuid tegelikult ei tea ta, mida ta tahab.
He didn't have to.	Ta ei pidanud seda tegema.
Today he told me why.	Täna ütles ta mulle, miks.
It's hard for me to do that.	Mul on raske seda teha.
I'm your wife now.	Olen nüüd su naine.
This thing here, this thing there.	See asi siin, see asi seal.
He must have known.	Kindlasti ta teadis.
He had seen it before.	Ta oli seda varem näinud.
It can't be.	See ei saa olla.
He's going again tomorrow.	Homme läheb ta uuesti.
Then it would have been easy.	Siis oleks see lihtne olnud.

He was sure he was looking forward to it and it was good.	Ta oli kindel, et ta ootab seda ja see oli hea.
There must be people.	Peab olema inimesi.
That was his old life.	See oli tema vana elu.
But you already know that.	Aga sa tead seda juba.
I can't do that.	Ma ei saa seda teha.
But no, it didn't have to be.	Aga ei, see ei pidanud olema.
Did it to me.	Tegi seda mulle.
More to come soon.	Rohkem tuleb varsti.

And it will not be easy.	Ja see ei saa olema lihtne.
I'm out.	Ma olen väljas.

That was a mistake.	See oli viga.
I didn't want to leave.	Ma ei tahtnud lahkuda.
It's so unfortunate.	Sellest on nii kahju.
He likes it.	Talle meeldib see.
He was worried about him.	Ta oli tema pärast mures.
I know how it is.	Ma tean, kuidas see on.
He certainly wasn't the one who asked for it.	Kindlasti ei olnud ta see, kes seda palus.

He looked inside.	Ta vaatas selle sisse.
It couldn't have been better.	Parem poleks saanud.
Can this be done better?	Kas seda saab paremini teha.
He seems to like it.	Tundub, et talle meeldib.

I'm sorry to say that, but it's true.	Mul on kahju seda öelda, kuid see on tõsi.
I hope it's not you.	Loodan, et see pole sina.
He doesn't remember him anymore.	Ta ei mäleta teda enam.
They said it could never be done, but our father did it.	Nad ütlesid, et seda ei saa kunagi teha, aga meie isa tegi seda.
You have too.	Sul on ka.
I think he has.	Ma arvan, et tal on.
I don't quite understand why you're doing this.	Ma ei saa päris hästi aru, miks sa seda teed.
He was very worried.	Ta oli väga mures.
I still do whatever it takes.	Ma teen ikka kõik, mis vaja.
Soon after, he fell asleep.	Varsti pärast seda jäi ta magama.
Just have to.	Lihtsalt peab.
I like not to know.	Mulle meeldib mitte teada.
If not now when?	Kui mitte praegu siis millal?.
But he didn't get a chance.	Kuid ta ei saanud võimalust.
That's the only one.	See on ainus.
Maybe better than you know.	Võib-olla paremini kui sa ise tead.
We need more of it.	Meil on seda rohkem vaja.
I don't know, not really.	Ma ei tea, tegelikult mitte.
What is it today.	Mis see täna on.
I'm surprised by you.	Ma olen sinust üllatunud.

Back.	Tagasi.

I'm a good friend.	Olen hea sõber.
It's definitely very beautiful.	Väga ilus see kindlasti on.
It was just a beautiful feeling.	Lihtsalt ilus tunne oli.
He was fine.	Ta oli sellega hästi.

Nobody saw him.	Keegi ei näinud teda.
He just understands that.	Ta lihtsalt saab sellest aru.
He didn't have to say anything.	Tal polnud vaja midagi öelda.

He already wanted him again.	Juba ta tahtis teda uuesti.
It's good to be good.	Hea on olla hea.
So is his wife.	Nii ka tema naine.
But we don't know why.	Kuid me ei tea, miks.

Too good, actually.	Liiga hästi, tegelikult.

It's your job.	See on sinu töö.
I don't know exactly how to tell you.	Ma ei tea täpselt, kuidas seda teile öelda.

Although in fact it is not so.	Kuigi tegelikult see nii ei ole.

Like three times.	Nagu kolm korda.
Good, but same.	Hea, aga sama.
It took a long time before he got over it.	Läks kaua aega, enne kui ta sellest üle saaks.
I never told him.	Ma ei öelnud talle kunagi.

I'm sure you understand.	Olen kindel, et saate aru.

There were so many, maybe too many.	Seda oli nii palju, võib-olla liiga palju.
And that was him.	Ja see oli tema.
We'll get it back.	Me saame selle tagasi.

Can anyone help please?	Kas keegi saab aidata palun?

He didn't have time before, but now he would.	Varem polnud tal aega, aga nüüd oleks.

It's just who you are.	See on lihtsalt see, kes sa oled.

It wasn't much.	Seda polnud palju.
But we still don't know how to do it.	Kuid me ei tea endiselt, kuidas seda teha.

What we couldn't do.	Mida me teha ei saanud.
We've been together all day.	Oleme terve päeva koos.
I do not know what to do.	Ma ei tea, mida teha.

Never do that now.	Nüüd ei tee seda kunagi.
But he did not hear him.	Kuid ta ei kuulnud teda.
I didn't hear anything he said.	Ma ei kuulnud midagi, mida ta ütles.
This can be a problem.	See võib olla probleem.
He no longer understood what had just happened.	Ta ei saanud enam aru, mis just juhtus.
So nothing this year.	Nii et sel aastal mitte midagi.
It could be done again.	Seda saaks uuesti teha.
He didn't understand who they were.	Ta ei saanud aru, kes nad on.
Come here.	Tule siia.
I'm not sure how he did it.	Ma pole kindel, kuidas ta seda tegi.
I don't think he just knew what to do.	Ma arvan, et ta lihtsalt ei teadnud, mida teha.
I've never seen anything like it before.	Pole kunagi varem midagi sellist näinud.
Finally he goes away.	Lõpuks läheb ta minema.
He just wants to work.	Ta tahab lihtsalt tööd teha.
I do it at home.	Ma teen seda kodus.
I thought the man was talking for too long.	Arvasin, et mees rääkis liiga kaua.
He didn't just talk.	Ta ei rääkinud ainult.
She was my mother.	Ta oli mu ema.
They never talked together again.	Nad ei rääkinud enam kunagi koos.
It was my life.	See oli minu elu.
Only this.	Ainult see.
he asked.	ta küsis.
But then something happens.	Siis aga juhtub midagi.
In fact, no one makes it.	Tegelikult ei tee sellest keegi.
He knew it, even if he didn't know it.	Ta teadis seda, isegi kui ta seda ei teadnud.
You do it.	Sa teed seda.
Tell me what happened.	Räägi, mis juhtus.
But here's the problem.	Kuid siin on probleem.
I thought it was you.	Ma arvasin, et see oled sina.
He still was.	Ta oli ikka veel.
That would be a good thing.	See oleks hea asi.
I'm sorry about that.	Mul on selle pärast kahju.
He came when he felt.	Ta tuli siis, kui tundis.
I don't understand why.	Ma ei saa aru, miks.
Didn't do me any good.	Ei teinud mulle head.
It was really hard to do.	Seda oli tõesti raske teha.
He went up and up.	Ta läks üles ja üles.
I just don't know what.	Ma lihtsalt ei tea mida.
I wanted to do better.	Tahtsin paremini teha.
I can't say why.	Ma ei oska öelda, miks.
There it is.	Seal see on.
Maybe we never did.	Võib-olla me pole seda kunagi teinud.
I can't believe it.	Ma ei suuda seda uskuda.
He knew the car.	Ta tundis autot.
And he said we had to talk now.	Ja ta ütles, et nüüd peame rääkima.
I think you like it there.	Ma arvan, et teile meeldib see seal.
He's waiting and waiting for it.	Ta ootab ja ootab seda.
How did he get the job?	Kuidas ta selle töö sai?
And it is now or never.	Ja see on nüüd või mitte kunagi.
He must have been tired.	Kindlasti oli ta väsinud.
But this is probably not the case.	Aga ilmselt see nii ei ole.
I couldn't work.	Ma ei saanud tööd teha.
He's always doing well.	Tal läheb alati hästi.
In fact, no one can.	Tegelikult ei saa keegi.
It was up to me.	See oli minu teha.
We will never do that again.	Me ei tee seda enam kunagi.
We couldn't do it anymore.	Me ei saanud seda enam teha.
That should not be the case.	See ei peaks nii olema.
But that was not true.	Kuid see polnud tõsi.
I'm not sure how many times we have to say that.	Ma pole kindel, mitu korda me peame seda ütlema.
Just like anything you want.	Täpselt nagu kõik, mida soovite.
These are the ones.	Need on need.
I'm just sorry they couldn't do that.	Mul on lihtsalt kahju, et nad ei suutnud seda teha.
We don't know it's definitely not good.	Me ei saa teada, et see pole kindlasti hea.
Did it see me? 	Kas see nägi mind?
He put me here.	Ta pani mind siia.
Here you are.	Siin sa oled.
Wait, friend.	Oota, sõber.
And the only reason for that.	Ja ainus põhjus, miks see nii on.
It wasn't a big deal.	See polnud suur asi.
In fact, he had.	Tegelikult oli tal.
And he's big.	Ja ta on ka suur.
I have to go soon.	Ma pean varsti minema.
He had wanted to.	Ta oli tahtnud.
But he was.	Aga ta oli.
But not fast enough.	Kuid mitte piisavalt kiiresti.
He just.	Ta lihtsalt.
No one really knows much about it.	Keegi ei tea sellest tegelikult palju.
And then it's you.	Ja siis oled sina.
There is a lot of work.	Tööd on palju.
That should definitely help.	See peaks kindlasti aitama.
She is a good woman and a good mother.	Ta on hea naine ja hea ema.
You are the father.	Sa oled isa.
I just didn't like it.	Mulle see lihtsalt ei meeldinud.
She's ready.	Ta on valmis.
I was no more.	Mind ei olnud enam.
So it worked out.	Nii et see sai korda.
He could wait.	Ta võiks oodata.
She had to tell him.	Ta pidi talle ütlema.
They really were.	Tõesti olid.
I wish you everything.	Soovin teile kõike.
He wanted to do it himself.	Ta tahtis ise hakkama saada.
He didn't go out much.	Ta ei käinud eriti väljas.
I know things.	Ma tean asju.
Who knows why.	Kes teab miks.
Not anymore.	Nüüd enam ei ole.
That's great.	See on suur.
He knew it better than he did.	Ta teadis seda paremini kui ta ise.
And you want what he wants.	Ja sa tahad seda, mida ta tahab.
I had to eat.	Mul oli süüa.
He knows that.	Ta teab seda.
We're ready to go again.	Oleme valmis uuesti minema.
He gave me life.	Ta andis mulle elu.
We have to.	Me peame.
I don't believe it anymore.	Ma ei usu seda enam.
It all happened very quickly.	See kõik juhtus väga kiiresti.
I don't know him.	Ei tunne teda.
I have to tell you, they're not very good.	Ma pean teile ütlema, et nad pole eriti head.
No, so fast.	Ei, nii kiiresti.
It will take place last year.	See toimub eelmisel aastal.
That's just it.	See on just see.
In fact, this was not true.	Tegelikult see ei olnud tõsi.
You won't get anything like that.	Sa ei saa midagi sellist.
They should be.	Nad peaksid olema.
I'll be back soon.	Olen varsti tagasi.
I am a human being.	Olen inimene.
He understood better.	Ta sai paremini aru.
I know how bad it is right now.	Ma tean, kui halb see praegu on.
He knows he's not the only one.	Ta teab, et ta pole ainus.
All three of us.	Me kõik kolm.
He didn't look good to me.	Ta ei näinud mulle hea välja.
I can't just go back there.	Ma ei saa lihtsalt sinna tagasi minna.
I thought so too.	Ma arvasin ka nii.
You don't need it.	Teil pole seda vaja.
It was not necessary.	Ei olnud seda vaja.
Really hard time actually.	Tõesti raske aeg tegelikult.
It seemed too easy.	See tundus liiga lihtne.
He was sure of that.	Ta oli selles kindel.
No, not good enough.	Ei, mitte piisavalt hea.
I've never seen it, you know.	Ma pole kunagi näinud, tead.
There he is.	Seal ta on.
He shouldn't have.	Ta poleks pidanud.
He couldn't work.	Ta ei saanud tööd teha.
I was ready for it.	Olin selleks valmis.
There is only one problem.	On ainult üks probleem.
That's when.	See on siis, kui.
And even then.	Ja isegi siis.
I also did a good job.	Ma tegin ka head tööd.
How fast can you leave?	Kui kiiresti saate lahkuda?
Where should we go today?	Kuhu me peaksime täna minema?
Maybe we should all be.	Võib-olla peaksime kõik olema.
But he didn't want to believe it.	Kuid ta ei tahtnud seda uskuda.
And something happens.	Ja midagi juhtub.
He felt it wasn't his business.	Tal oli tunne, et see polnud tema asi.
But don't.	Aga ei tee.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Kuid see ei pea nii olema.
Now there is a problem.	Nüüd on probleem.
It's much better now.	Nüüd on palju parem.
There is no time now.	Nüüd pole aega.
Maybe not now, but soon.	Võib-olla mitte kohe, aga varsti.
The damage was not great last night.	Kahju eile õhtul polnud suur.
He doesn't think anyone but us can do that.	Ta ei usu, et keegi peale meie seda saaks teha.
Where was it supposed to be.	Kus see pidi olema.
It doesn't come in here.	See ei tule siia sisse.
Like .	Nagu .
It was him too.	See oli ka tema.
And not just here.	Ja mitte ainult siin.

He wanted it.	Ta tahtis seda.
He didn't see me.	Ta ei näinud mind.
It felt very good.	Väga hea tunne oli.
He had definitely not been there before.	Ta polnud seal kindlasti varem käinud.
I don't know why you can't just live together.	Ma ei tea, miks te ei saa lihtsalt koos elada.
Apparently I was then too.	Ilmselt olin ka siis.
He looked surprised.	Ta näis üllatunud.
And here he is.	Ja siin ta on.
It did a good job.	See tegi head tööd.

asked my father.	küsis mu isa.
I have to sleep.	Ma pean magama.

It didn't look too good.	See ei näinud liiga hea välja.
Then there was no going.	Siis ei olnud enam minna.
I have a job for you.	Mul on sulle töö.
He had nothing to say.	Tal polnud midagi öelda.
But that's something.	Aga see on midagi.
And it does.	Ja teeb seda.
We can handle it.	Me saame sellega hakkama.
That's all there is to it.	Seal on ainult see.
But we are who we are.	Aga me oleme need, kes oleme.
I think so.	Ma arvan, et nii see oli.
Why don't you come?	Miks sa ei tule?
Nothing.	Mitte midagi.
It happened quite quickly.	See juhtus üsna kiiresti.

He knew up and down.	Ta teadis üles ja alla.
It's a better feeling.	See on parem tunne.
Now and now and now, what is really here.	Nüüd ja praegu ja praegu, mis siin tegelikult on.
And left.	Ja lahkus.

It was hard work.	See oli raske töö.
He had it.	Tal oli see.
Couple.	Paar.
Like he didn't want to say.	Nagu ta ei tahtnud öelda.
So even that is good.	Nii et isegi see on hea.
It was nothing, really.	See polnud midagi, tõesti.
But we can do almost nothing.	Kuid me ei saa peaaegu midagi teha.
But that was never his way.	Kuid see polnud kunagi tema tee.
I like it a lot more.	See meeldib mulle palju rohkem.

It was so easy to do.	Seda oli nii lihtne teha.
I think that's true.	Ma arvan, et see on tõsi.
But the man didn't hear.	Aga mees ei kuulnud.
Has anyone seen him?	Kas keegi on teda näinud?
He knows something about me.	Ta teab minust midagi.
So he can see.	Et ta saaks näha.

There was another man.	Seal oli veel üks mees.
I eat at home, he said.	Ma teen kodus süüa, ütles ta.
He does it for everyone.	Ta teeb seda kõigile.
But we didn't know that.	Aga me ei teadnud seda.
Wait a little while.	Oota veidi aega.
It's none of my business.	See pole minu asi.

Now he knew what it was.	Nüüd teadis ta, mis see oli.
It finally does something for me.	Lõpuks teeb see mulle midagi.
If it were.	Kui oleks.
And then he talked to me.	Ja siis ta rääkis minuga.

He goes through a lot of things.	Ta elab palju asju läbi.

You can't believe what he says.	Sa ei suuda uskuda, mida ta ütleb.
Don't do this to me.	Ära tee seda minuga.
And I think what he said was actually what he really felt.	Ja ma arvan, et see, mida ta ütles, oli tegelikult see, mida ta tegelikult tunneb.
I would have understood.	oleksin aru saanud.
I don't remember exactly.	Ma ei mäleta täpselt.
Maybe a lot of things.	Võib-olla palju asju.

This is my hard work.	See on minu raske töö.
He wasn't ready, he wasn't ready.	Ta ei olnud valmis, ta ei olnud valmis.
I couldn't talk or anything.	Ma ei saanud rääkida ega midagi.

It was just last year.	Just eelmisel aastal oli.

So he looked at her.	Nii et ta vaatas teda.
That was bad.	See oli halb.
This is not.	See ei ole.

Now was my chance.	Nüüd oli minu võimalus.
I shouldn't have said anything.	Ma poleks pidanud midagi ütlema.
Next morning.	Järgmisel hommikul.
I was all of him.	Ma olin tema kõik.
The old woman said nothing.	Vana naine ei öelnud midagi.
Everything is still there.	Kõik on alles.
He wants to see if he's good.	Ta tahaks näha, kas ta on hea.
He knew everything would be alright.	Ta teadis, et kõik saab korda.
Now we have to go.	Nüüd peame minema.
He needed money.	Tal oli raha vaja.
But in this !!.	Aga selles!!.
I don't know him that well.	Ma ei tunne teda nii hästi.
So there's really no need to say anything.	Nii et tegelikult pole vaja midagi öelda.
Maybe.	Võib olla.
But this thing.	Aga see asi.
Tell him you're worried about him.	Ütle talle, et oled tema pärast mures.
I knew it would happen.	Ma teadsin, et nii läheb.
Now there is only one more thing.	Nüüd on ainult üks asi veel.

I'm not out yet.	Ma pole veel väljas.

He had done that.	Seda ta oli teinud.
He told himself that.	Ta ütles seda endale.

He came.	Ta tuli.

He was busy.	Ta oli hõivatud.
I can't do that.	Ma ei saa seda teha.

Now the problem is that this is always true.	Nüüd on probleem selles, et see on alati tõsi.
That was true.	See oli kas tõsi.

You like your job.	Sulle meeldib su töö.

I already have money.	Mul on juba raha.
I don't buy it.	Ma ei osta seda.

And I don't think I can do it.	Ja ma ei usu, et saan sellega hakkama.
I would be happy.	Mul oleks hea meel.
That has been the case.	Nii on olnud.

This is the first.	See on esimene.

That's what we've seen.	Seda me oleme näinud.
It just happens that way.	See lihtsalt juhtub nii.

I'm more worried about you.	Ma olen sinu pärast rohkem mures.

He would do it.	Ta teeks seda.

He has no more.	Tal pole rohkem.
It's nothing.	See pole midagi.
I'm not saying it's easy, but it can be done.	Ma ei ütle, et see on lihtne, aga sellega saab hakkama.
It was our father.	See oli meie isa.
Never, just not today.	Kunagi, lihtsalt mitte täna.

That's what you do.	Seda sa teed.
It has all been.	Kõik see on olnud.
He died soon after.	Varsti pärast seda ta suri.
He got what he wanted.	Ta sai, mida tahtis.
That's really the case.	See on tõesti nii.
He came and went.	Ta tuli ja läks.
Not anymore.	Enam mitte.
In fact, you can do it right away.	Tegelikult saate seda kohe teha.
Three in the morning.	Kolm hommikul.
He's just a happy man.	Ta on lihtsalt õnnelik mees.
This man is no longer my friend.	See mees pole enam mu sõber.
You don't know how happy you are, he said.	Sa ei tea, kui õnnelik sul on, ütles ta.
In this too.	Ka selles.
He wasn't sure what he was going to do.	Ta ei olnud kindel, mida ta kavatseb teha.
We don't have that many people there.	Meil ei ole seal nii palju inimesi.
Maybe it would.	Võib-olla oleks.
I didn't want to know if he could do it.	Ma ei tahtnud teada, kas ta suudab seda teha.
He never said.	Ta ei öelnud kunagi.
They were one.	Nad olid üks.
It wasn't a good feeling.	See ei olnud hea tunne.
Time is not waiting for anyone.	Aeg ei oota kedagi.
We have to go now.	Peame kohe minema.

What is not here or there.	Mida pole siin ega seal.
You know better than I do.	Sa tead paremini kui mina.
It's none of our business.	See pole meie asi.
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Kas keegi saab mind selles aidata?.
But eat now.	Aga söö nüüd.
But they didn't really want to.	Aga nad ei tahtnud seda tegelikult.
He knew he could do it alone.	Ta teadis, et üksi saab ta sellega hakkama.
But come here.	Tule aga siia.
Just a man.	Lihtsalt mees.
He's home.	Ta on koju läinud.
He was a good man and he was my friend.	Ta oli hea mees ja ta oli mu sõber.
I didn't like it very much.	Mulle see väga ei meeldinud.
Which was perfectly good for me.	Mis oli minu jaoks täiesti hea.
But he didn't want to go out on his own.	Kuid ta ei tahtnud ise välja minna.
Did he think he could get out of it.	Kas ta arvas, et saab sellest välja.
No, he wasn't.	Ei, ta ei olnud.
Even so.	Isegi nii.
This is very difficult for me.	See on minu jaoks väga raske.
It can't be.	Seda ei saa.
But he wouldn't do that.	Aga ta ei teeks seda.
And now this.	Ja nüüd see.

There seemed to be no time.	Tundus, et pole aega.
He looked at him.	Ta vaatas teda.
He could never even see it.	Ta ei saanud seda kunagi isegi näha.

You are my father.	Sa oled mu isa.
I don't really know why.	Ma ei tea tegelikult, miks.
And although there was still a lot to do,	Ja kuigi teha oli veel palju,
He had my mother.	Tal oli mu ema.
You don't know why you're here.	Sa ei tea midagi, miks sa siin oled.
I'm sure it's him.	Olen kindel, et see on tema.
He just didn't like it.	Talle see lihtsalt ei meeldinud.
He didn't think it was good enough.	Ta ei arvanud, et see oli piisavalt hea.
Where does the money come from?	Kust raha tuleb?
As it should be.	Nagu ka peaks.
If that's what you want.	Kui see on see, mida sa tahad.
I wonder how it was.	Huvitav, kuidas see oli.
I can't wait.	Ma ei saa oodata.
He might as well be here.	Sama hästi võib ta siin olla.
I'm sure they won't let him.	Olen kindel, et nad ei lase tal.
I'm just worried.	Olen lihtsalt mures.
And he got something.	Ja ta sai ka midagi juurde.
I don't understand that.	Ma ei saa sellest aru.
He wasn't quite ready to say yet.	Ta polnud veel päris valmis selleks, mida öelda.
It's good to be back.	Hea on tagasi olla.
Then you have an interesting.	Siis on sul huvitav.

I want a man to do something like that for me.	Soovin, et mees teeks minu jaoks midagi sellist.
I will go to sleep now.	Ma lähen nüüd magama.
That's not good.	See ei ole hea.
It's hard work.	See on raske töö.
I used to be myself.	Varem ma ise.
It just happened.	See lihtsalt juhtus.
I hope this helps someone.	Loodan, et sellest on kellelegi abi.

I told him how hard your life is.	Ma ütlesin talle, kui raske su elu on.
I just can't get it.	Ma lihtsalt ei saa seda.
In your time, not mine.	Sinu ajal, mitte minu.

That says it all.	See ütleb juba kõik.
I did it earlier today.	Tegin selle täna varem.
But don't make a mistake.	Aga ära tee viga.
He is a very big boy indeed!	Ta on tõesti väga suur poiss!

So the same for me.	Nii et sama minu jaoks.
That's his job.	See on tema töö.

He did well.	Tal läks hästi.
There is nothing here.	Siin pole midagi.

He felt it too.	Ka tema tundis seda.
We just are.	Me lihtsalt oleme.
But that was too bad of me.	Aga see oli minust liiga halb.

You probably don't remember him.	Sa ilmselt ei mäleta teda.
He doesn't understand.	Ta ei saa aru.
What came after is.	Mis tuli pärast, on.
It works for me.	See töötab minu jaoks.

He says he does.	Ta ütleb, et teeb.
That's true as far as it goes.	See on tõsi, nii palju kui see läheb.

It really didn't go very well.	See tõesti ei läinud väga hästi.
Well.	Hästi.

I am very sorry that it took me so long.	Mul on väga kahju, et mul nii kaua aega läks.
Not so much anymore.	Enam mitte nii väga.
I never liked him.	Ta pole mulle kunagi meeldinud.

She saw.	Ta nägi.
He did a lot of things for me.	Ta tegi mulle palju asju.
It was now.	See oli nüüd.
It's been this week.	See on olnud sel nädalal.
Still too much.	Ikka liiga palju.
They are very good and you had a very easy time.	Nad on väga head ja teil oli väga lihtne.
And then you knew what you wanted to do.	Ja siis teadsid, mida teha tahad.
He hadn't told her yet.	Ta polnud talle veel öelnud.
I saw it myself.	Ma nägin seda ise.
It does it for us.	See teeb seda meie jaoks.
Good luck.	Head teed.
It's easy for him to say.	Tal on lihtne öelda.
I want it.	Ma tahan seda.
Only he wasn't an old man.	Ainult et ta polnud vana mees.
I want to know more about it.	Ma tahan selle kohta rohkem teada saada.
Here he thought the woman had come to him.	Siin arvas ta, et naine tuli tema juurde.
And you weren't.	Ja sa ei olnud.
Maybe a little.	Võib, natuke.
I should have done more.	Oleksin pidanud rohkem tegema.
I'd like to see what comes out.	Tahaks näha, mis välja tuleb.

We are not doing this right now.	Praegu me seda ei tee.
He did it.	Ta sai hakkama.
Not now.	Praegu mitte.
But you have to help me.	Aga sa pead mind aitama.
And now it's over.	Ja nüüd on kõik läbi.
My father was a good man.	Mu isa oli hea mees.
Now he can do what he wants.	Nüüd saab ta teha, mida tahab.
But it's coming.	Aga see tuleb.
It's there.	See on seal.

And it will not be easy.	Ja see ei saa olema lihtne.
Everything feels good to me.	Mulle tundub kõik hästi.

That's a little bit.	See on natuke.
It was his.	See oli tema oma.

I almost go back.	Ma lähen peaaegu tagasi.
But he's not even sure of that.	Kuid ta pole isegi selles kindel.
It can't be needed.	Seda ei saa vaja minna.
He might say it could be better.	Ta võib öelda, et see võib olla parem.
I think it would be.	Ma arvan, et oleks.
It couldn't be done that easy.	Seda ei saanud teha, nii lihtne see on.

I still had time, but probably not much.	Mul oli veel aega, aga ilmselt mitte palju.
I don't see it myself.	Ma ise seda ei näe.
he said.	ta ütles.
It went with him.	See läks temaga kaasa.
I haven't seen him.	Ma pole teda näinud.
It should be.	See peaks olema.

I never got a chance to tell him.	Mul pole kunagi olnud võimalust talle öelda.
He won't get anything out of it.	Ta ei saa sellest midagi.
I had nothing left of it.	Mulle ei jäänud sellest midagi.

Life is work.	Elu on töö.
I'd like to go home.	Tahaks koju tagasi.

We had a life.	Meil oli elu.
Maybe someday.	Võibolla kunagi.
Who is.	Kes on.
The one who did all the talking.	See, kes kõik rääkis.
But his mother looked tired.	Tema ema nägi aga välja väsinud.
She's fine.	Tal on hästi läinud.
If you are happy where you are, it is good for you.	Kui sa oled õnnelik seal, kus sa oled, on sulle hea.
You know when he is.	Tead, kui ta.
No, he's not going in anymore.	Ei, ta ei lähe enam sisse.

It was almost one in the afternoon.	Kell oli peaaegu üks pärastlõunal.

I'm having a hard time.	Mul on raske.
I was in trouble.	Mina olin probleem.

And you will definitely know more about it.	Ja kindlasti saate selle kohta rohkem teada.
The same thing could be done tomorrow as well.	Sama hästi võiks teha sama asja ka homme.
You either do it or you don't.	Sa kas teed seda või ei tee.
It's just that he's a little late.	Ainult, et ta on veidi hiljaks jäänud.
That would be.	See oleks.

He said he was waiting for me.	Ta ütles, et ootab mind.

I didn't like it.	Mulle see ei meeldinud.
I've never done it myself.	Ma pole seda kunagi ise teinud.
We can help !.	Saame aidata!.
Earlier than you think.	Varem kui arvate.
Like a couple there.	Nagu paar seal.
About you, about me.	Sinust, minust.
It was all for you.	See kõik oli sinu pärast.
He didn't see anything.	Ta ei näinud midagi.
I became.	minust sai.
Maybe you are.	Võib-olla oled.
All three of us.	Me kõik kolm.
All day.	Terve päeva.

It happened again.	See juhtus uuesti.
I think he may need help.	Ma arvan, et võib-olla vajab ta abi.

He looked at his father.	Ta vaatas oma isa.

And he lives.	Ja ta elab.
He had seen it.	Ta oli seda näinud.

Then he finally spoke.	Siis lõpuks rääkis ta.
There were things he wanted to know.	Oli asju, mida ta tahtis teada saada.
He was ready.	Ta oli valmis.

They were definitely alone.	Nad olid kindlasti üksi.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ma teadsin, et see juhtub.
It was good to do that, he told himself.	Seda oli hea teha, ütles ta endale.
So this is probably your problem.	Nii et see on tõenäoliselt teie probleem.
I just want you.	Ma lihtsalt tahan sind.
Not even for me.	Isegi mitte mulle.
He talked for a long time.	Ta rääkis kaua.
I used to do that.	Kunagi tegin seda.

He says it's not him, though.	Ta ütleb, et see pole tema, aga.
I was bad.	Mul oli halb.
That is not what we want.	Seda me ei taha.
There was everything and nothing to talk about.	Rääkida oli kõike ja mitte midagi.
You don't do that.	Sa ei tee seda.
But wait, there's more.	Aga oota, seal on veel.
He has always had it.	Tal on see alati olnud.
That's better.	Parem on nii.
Let him go.	Lase tal minna.
You and yours and yours.	Sinu ja sinu ja sinu oma.
It seemed like one.	Tundus nagu üks.
Although not often.	Kuigi mitte sageli.
One that needed to be seen.	Üks, mida oli vaja näha.
Then he came out.	Siis ta tuli välja.

He doesn't know it's us.	Ta ei tea, et see oleme meie.

He didn't know.	Ta ei teadnud.
I'm not there anymore.	Ma ei ole enam.
But he couldn't do anything about it.	Kuid ta ei saanud selle vastu midagi teha.
I actually had.	Mul tegelikult oli.
And so are we.	Ja me oleme ka.

I'm the man.	Mina olen see mees.
Be her friend.	Ole tema sõber.
I want to know what's going on here.	Ma tahan teada, mis siin toimub.

It felt good to finally say it.	Hea tunne oli see lõpuks välja öelda.
I've heard it's good.	Olen kuulnud, et see on hea.
I knew that was the reason.	Ma teadsin, et see oli põhjus.
That is if you are at all interested.	Seda siis, kui olete üldse huvitatud.
But the money was still there.	Aga raha seal ikka oli.
This happens too often.	Seda juhtub liiga sageli.
I'm still there.	Olen ikka veel seal.
Maybe he did it this year.	Võib-olla tegi ta seda sel aastal.
I want to know why.	Ma tahan teada, miks.
Is there time left?	Kas aega jääb?
He now had one.	Tal oli nüüd üks.
There is no such thing.	Sellist asja pole.
But that's not the point.	Asi pole aga selles.
Like you're probably doing.	Nagu sina ilmselt teed.

Which is bad.	Mis on halb.
He asked for more tea.	Ta palus veel teed.

I saw him.	Ma nägin teda.
It couldn't be.	See ei saanud olla.

But it turns out well.	Aga see tuleb hästi välja.
But no one will know until it actually happens.	Kuid keegi ei tea seda enne, kui see tegelikult juhtub.

He didn't want to be late.	Ta ei tahtnud hiljaks jääda.
I'm not sure what to believe or not.	Ma pole kindel, mida uskuda või mida mitte.

I don't want to wait.	Ma ei taha oodata.

To find out more.	Et rohkem teada saada.
This has never been the case.	See pole kunagi nii olnud.
And it doesn't have to be that way anymore.	Ja see ei pea enam nii olema.

Maybe you can talk to him.	Võib-olla saate temaga rääkida.
That's not so much.	Seda pole nii palju.
Over and over again.	Uuesti ja uuesti.
My mother told me last year.	Mu ema rääkis mulle eelmisel aastal.
I'm sorry to say that.	Mul on kahju seda öelda.
It can't be.	See ei saa olla.
Like you don't want to be here.	Nagu sa ei tahaks siin olla.
My husband didn't tell me anything about it.	Mu mees ei öelnud mulle sellest midagi.
I've never seen him.	Ma pole teda kunagi näinud.
Can't you see what's going on here?	Kas sa ei näe, mis siin toimub?
I think that's bad.	Ma arvan, et see on halb.
I'm not sure.	Ma pole täpselt kindel.
I don't understand that.	Ma ei saa sellest aru.
I'm actually very worried.	Olen tegelikult väga mures.
I've never seen him before.	Ma pole teda kunagi varem näinud.
If he had, he would have done it and he wouldn't have been there.	Kui ta oleks, oleks ta teinud ja teda poleks seal.
They hadn't done anything.	Nad polnud midagi teinud.
I told him again.	Ütlesin talle uuesti.
It's happening tomorrow.	See toimub homme.
Everything would be fine now.	Nüüd oleks kõik hästi.
And maybe not.	Ja võib-olla mitte.
And you're late.	Ja sa oled hiljaks jäänud.
And be with you.	Ja olla sinuga.
We have to help him.	Peame teda aitama.
It was a lot of help.	Sellest oli palju abi.
It doesn't do what it says.	See ei tee seda, mida ta ütleb.
I don't know if he was or wasn't.	Ma ei tea, kas ta oli või ei olnud.
It can't be very bad.	See ei saa olla väga halb.
I'm not there right now.	Ma ei ole praegu seal.
He wanted this life.	Ta tahtis seda elu.
That's all for him.	See on tema jaoks kõik.
You don't know how much.	Sa ei tea, kui palju.
Or did not believe him.	Või ei uskunud teda.
I haven't finished yet.	Ma ei lõpetanud seda veel.
Like he couldn't believe it.	Nagu ta ei suutnud seda uskuda.
But there was nothing there.	Aga seal polnud midagi.
He doesn't know.	Ta ei tunne.
But nothing for myself.	Enda jaoks aga mitte midagi.
I don't want to go.	Ma ei taha minna.
I didn't know that either.	Ma ei teadnud ka seda.
He likes.	Talle meeldib.
There aren't really many good jobs.	Head tööd pole tegelikult palju.
But it's more, much more.	Kuid see on rohkem, palju rohkem.
But then he didn't have to.	Aga siis ta ei pidanud seda tegema.
How he wanted him.	Kuidas ta teda tahtis.
Here it is.	Siin see on.
I don't know what it would be.	Ma ei tea, mis see oleks.
He is also very happy.	Ka tema on väga õnnelik.
She was as beautiful as ever.	Ta oli sama ilus kui kunagi varem.
I'm not doing this.	Ma ei tee seda.
It doesn't make that error anymore.	See ei tee seda viga enam.
Everything still looked good.	Kõik nägi ikka hea välja.
It just seemed so much.	See tundus lihtsalt nii palju.
We just couldn't live together.	Me ei saanud lihtsalt koos elada.
He knew better now.	Ta teadis nüüd paremini.
You never do that.	Sa ei tee seda kunagi.
But only you can do it.	Kuid ainult teie saate seda teha.
Not that it was needed.	Mitte et seda vaja oleks olnud.
Not if you don't want to.	Mitte, kui sa ei taha.
I very much agree.	Olen väga nõus.
Mine isn't always so pretty.	Minu oma pole alati nii ilus.
All but us.	Kõik peale meie.
Whether this is true is unknown.	Kas see tõsi on, pole teada.
I should do my job.	Ma peaksin oma tööd tegema.
But he couldn't do it.	Kuid ta ei saanud seda teha.
I'm tired of it.	Olen sellest väsinud.
He was sure of that.	Ta oli selles kindel.
I really was.	Ma olin tõesti.
I wouldn't do such a thing.	Ma ei teeks sellist asja.
You've done it.	Olete seda teinud.
But you just can't.	Aga sa lihtsalt ei saa.
But he never comes.	Aga ta ei tule kunagi.
He gave me too much help.	Ta andis mulle liiga palju abi.
It doesn't have to be a friend.	See ei pea olema sõber.
He felt things.	Ta tundis asju.
It looked so old.	See tundus nii vana.
More is not always better.	Rohkem ei ole alati parem.
But it wasn't there.	Aga seda polnud seal.
This man is not that.	See mees pole see.
I've never seen anything like it.	Ma polnud kunagi sellist asja näinud.
Mine is not.	Minu oma ei ole.
But it wasn't a car.	Aga see ei olnud auto.
Not even who you were.	Isegi mitte see, kes sa olid.
But he couldn't, not yet.	Aga ta ei saanud, veel mitte.
It's been my whole life.	On olnud terve mu elu.
I don't want to live like this.	Ma ei taha nii elada.
I still have work to do.	Pean veel tööd tegema.
It's never easy.	See pole kunagi lihtne.
That he wanted to live again.	Et ta tahtis uuesti elada.
But it was more than great.	Kuid see oli rohkem kui suur.
I know, but .	Ma tean, aga .
He doesn't have to say anything.	Ta ei pea midagi ütlema.
I've never done it and never will.	Ma pole seda kunagi teinud ja ei tee ka kunagi.
So he wasn't.	Nii et ta ei olnud.
They should and should talk about it.	Nad peaksid ja peaksid sellest rääkima.
Maybe he wasn't.	Võib-olla ta ei olnud.
Same as now.	Sama nagu praegu.
We don't want to go back there.	Me ei taha sinna tagasi minna.
It's easy enough to believe.	Seda on piisavalt lihtne uskuda.
I have to tell you again.	Ma pean sulle uuesti rääkima.
But if he didn't.	Aga kui ta seda ei teeks.
It was so good.	See oli nii hea.
I just haven't seen it.	Ma lihtsalt pole seda näinud.
I don't know how it works, but it works.	Ma ei tea, kuidas see töötab, aga töötab.
He told him that often.	Ta ütles talle seda sageli.
He went out again this morning.	Täna hommikul läks ta uuesti välja.
I'm not making any more problems.	Ma ei tee rohkem probleeme.
He never had.	Tal pole kunagi olnud.
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.	Ma ei tea, mis homme saab.
How can I do this.	Kuidas ma seda teha saan.
This is for you.	See on teie jaoks.
It won't work!	See ei lähe läbi!
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.	Ma ei oleks natuke üllatunud.
He probably had.	Tal ilmselt oli.
He was especially good at that.	Selles oli ta eriti hea.
Then he went inside and went to sleep.	Siis läks ta sisse ja läks magama.
This is not always true.	See pole alati tõsi.
And that's something we didn't have last year.	Ja see on midagi, mida meil eelmisel aastal ei olnud.
They just don't do anything.	Nad lihtsalt ei tee midagi.
Everything was interesting.	Kõik oli huvitav.
He was there to help him.	Oli seal, et teda aidata.
Nobody wanted to know anything.	Keegi ei tahtnud midagi teada.
No, he wouldn't.	Ei, ta ei teeks.
And not only that.	Ja mitte ainult seda.
What was is better.	Mis oli, on parem.
Do it, he did.	Tee seda, ta tegi.
But that would not be the case.	See aga nii ei oleks.
He had to be.	Ta pidi olema.
I can't be sure.	Ma ei saa kindel olla.
There was no one at the time	Sel ajal polnud kedagi
I don't think that's good.	Ma arvan, et see ei ole hea.
Mom wanted her to do something.	Ema tahtis, et ta midagi teeks.
I've never done this before, and it was really interesting.	Ma pole seda kunagi varem teinud ja see oli tõesti huvitav.
I didn't even know it was coming.	Ma isegi ei teadnud, et see tuleb.
So maybe he hadn't really seen anything.	Nii et võib-olla polnud ta tegelikult midagi näinud.
But maybe we shouldn't have been so surprised.	Kuid võib-olla poleks me pidanud olema nii üllatunud.
It was definitely not here.	Kindlasti polnud see siin.
All of him.	Kõik ta.
When he felt better, there was enough time.	Kui ta end paremini tundis, oli aega piisavalt.
And the house.	Ja maja.
It doesn't have to be much.	Seda ei pea palju olema.
No one ever thought it would happen.	Keegi polnud kunagi arvanud, et see juhtub.
Not really necessary.	Pole tegelikult vaja.
This is a mistake.	See on viga.
He has to be.	Ta peab olema.
That wasn't the point.	Asi polnud selles.
It didn't look much.	See ei näinud palju välja.
I just wasn't ready to tell him everything.	Ma lihtsalt polnud valmis talle kõike rääkima.
He doesn't have to say more.	Ta ei pea rohkem ütlema.
I was a man.	Ma olin mees.
Why should you.	Miks sa peaksid.
Interesting, but not his problem.	Huvitav, aga mitte tema probleem.
But he couldn't, not quite yet.	Aga ta ei saanud, mitte päris veel.
Nobody knows.	Keegi ei tea.
It's not hard to do.	Seda pole raske teha.
He looked at him.	Ta vaatas teda.
Can anyone help me?	Kas keegi saab mind aidata?
I doubt he'll be back.	Kahtlen, kas ta tagasi tuleb.
He was a teacher.	Ta oli õpetaja.
Even if you can.	Isegi kui saate.
All a few years older than you, but not much.	Kõik sinust paar aastat vanemad, aga mitte palju.
Over and over again.	Uuesti ja uuesti.
He didn't make a mistake.	Ta ei teinud viga.
This can be quite difficult.	See võib olla üsna raske.
It's too big for me.	See on minu jaoks liiga suur.
I think you're going to be a good father.	Ma arvan, et sinust saab hea isa.
I probably should.	Ilmselt peaksin.
I hadn't expected anything like that.	Ma polnud midagi sellist oodanud.
But there are no people.	Aga inimesi pole.
It's still a big deal.	See on ikka suur asi.
I'm sure he was pretty out.	Olen kindel, et ta oli üsna väljas.
But it's over now.	Aga see on nüüd läbi.
But there is a problem.	Aga seal on probleem.
He knew what he had to do.	Ta teadis, mida ta tegema pidi.
But now.	Aga praegu.
He was over with it now.	Ta oli sellega nüüd läbi.
He didn't look good.	Ta ei näinud hea välja.
I have to do what I need to do.	Ma pean tegema, mis vaja.
She's not that pretty.	Ta pole nii ilus.
She's still my mother.	Ta on ikka mu ema.
He wasn't that big.	Ta ei olnud nii suur.
And it actually went well.	Ja tegelikult läks hästi.
Time is not money.	Aeg ei ole raha.
He spoke quickly.	Ta rääkis kiiresti.
I don't understand what it is.	Ei saa aru, mis see on.
And you know it.	Ja sa tead seda.
Very good person.	Väga hea inimene.
I'm so sorry, though.	Mul on väga kahju, aga.
Or isn't it.	Või ei ole seda.
I didn't know how.	Ma ei teadnud, kuidas.
He was much better at it than he was.	Ta oli selles palju parem kui tema.
Come on, he told himself.	Tule nüüd, ütles ta endale.
That's a mistake.	Sellest ka viga.
In the end, there was nothing left to do.	Lõpuks polnud enam midagi teha.
I'm going to do it now.	Ma lähen seda nüüd tegema.
You've seen it.	Sa oled seda näinud.
You can't talk about it.	Sa ei saa sellest välja rääkida.
I want to play back.	Ma tahan tagasi mängida.
But there must be something.	Aga midagi peab olema.
That must be said.	Seda tuleb öelda.
That may tell us something.	See võib meile midagi öelda.
One where you are.	Üks, kus sa oled.
He had to say more.	Ta pidi rohkem ütlema.
To understand what is going on.	Et aru saada, mis toimub.
Are you.	Kas sa oled.
Surely is.	Kindlasti on.
He bought it.	Ta ostis selle.
He really wanted to go.	Ta tahtis väga minna.
There is still a long way to go.	Palju on veel minna.
Says he has to go.	Ütleb, et peab minema.
This is a problem.	See on probleem.
And they probably can't.	Ja nad ilmselt ei saa.
But it just never seemed like an opportunity.	Kuid lihtsalt ei paistnud kunagi olevat võimalust.
I really want it.	Ma tõesti tahan seda.
And you have to do it.	Ja sa pead seda tegema.
But this is not the case.	Kuid see pole nii.
It could be tomorrow.	See võib olla homme.
I'm pretty sure you are too.	Olen üsna kindel, et ka sina.
I wanted to know what it feels like.	Tahtsin teada, mis tunne see on.
This actually happened.	See juhtus tegelikult.
I've never told anyone.	Ma pole seda kunagi kellelegi rääkinud.
Don't say that.	Ära räägi nii.
Will he ever.	Kas ta kunagi.
Only not so fast.	Ainult mitte nii kiiresti.
And talk to him.	Ja räägi temaga.
He was good to me.	Ta oli minu vastu hea.
It happened.	See juhtus.
He thought he was doing exactly what was needed.	Ta arvas, et teeb täpselt seda, mida vaja.
They don't know what to do.	Nad ei tea, mida teha.
Maybe I would.	Võib-olla teeks.
This is for me.	See on minu jaoks.
You should have it.	Sul peaks see olema.
I've never seen anything like it.	Ma pole kunagi midagi sellist näinud.
Why, why, why.	Miks, miks, miks.
You have to be the one to do things.	Sina pead olema see, kes asju teeb.
This is not a problem for me.	See ei ole minu jaoks probleem.
He wanted to.	Ta tahtis.
This is not the case for me.	Minu jaoks see pole nii.
It's just not.	See lihtsalt ei ole.
I was there too.	Mina olin ka seal.
No, not just yet.	Ei, mitte ainult veel.
You couldn't buy it for money.	Raha eest poleks saanud seda osta.
Would have done it.	Oleks seda teinud.
My mother told me that.	Mu ema ütles mulle seda.
Please let me go.	Palun lase mul minna.
Probably not too much.	Ilmselt mitte liiga palju.
So it was hard for him.	Nii et see oli tema jaoks raske.
You only have one option.	Sul on ainult üks võimalus.
Do what you want!	Tee mida sa tahad!
It can help you.	See võib teid aidata.
I certainly understand that.	Ma saan sellest kindlasti aru.
That's right here.	Siin on nii.
Me too.	Mina ka.
I am so happy to do this job.	Mul on nii hea meel seda tööd teha.
A lot of time.	Palju aega.
He wouldn't do that.	Ta ei teeks seda.
In the end, it gets too much for me.	Lõpuks saab seda minu jaoks liiga palju.
You have only one option.	Teil on ainult üks võimalus.
And then my mother.	Ja siis mu ema.
And that's a beautiful thing.	Ja see on ilus asi.
Life is beautiful.	Elu on ilus.
You will become a father.	Sinust saab isa.
I like it, he says.	Mulle meeldib, ütleb ta.
But you can't be sure.	Aga kindel ei saa olla.
That's for sure now.	See on nüüd kindel.
This is just the first.	See on alles esimene.
They are not there to buy.	Nad ei ole seal, et osta.
That would have been good.	See oleks olnud hea.
But they will be soon.	Aga need on varsti.
Time, that's a problem.	Aeg, see on probleem.
We like to play there.	Meile meeldib seal mängida.
John sees it.	John näeb seda.
Not here either.	Ka siin mitte.
How true that is.	Kui tõsi see on.
If we used to.	Kui me varem.
I don't think so.	Ma arvan, et mitte.
Or get what they didn't get before.	Või saada seda, mida nad varem polnud saanud.
I hope the same.	Ma loodan sama.
He did not speak.	Ta ei rääkinud.
It must be difficult.	See peab olema raske.
Your mother is almost ready.	Su ema on peaaegu valmis.
You don't do that.	Sa ei tee seda.
Then he spoke.	Siis ta rääkis.
No, it wouldn't be the same.	Ei, see poleks sama.
We don't need more of you.	Me ei vaja rohkem teid.
It's more for us.	See on rohkem meie jaoks.
When he was over, he was over.	Kui ta läbi sai, oli ta läbi.
Which probably says something good about us.	Mis ilmselt ütleb meie kohta midagi head.
He had heard that.	Ta oli seda kuulnud.
But they're out there.	Aga nad on seal väljas.
I was just tired.	Ma olin lihtsalt väsinud.
That's about all anyone ever said to me.	See on peaaegu kõik, mida keegi mulle kunagi ütles.
I don't think you should, you know.	Ma arvan, et sa ei peaks, tead.
They were like us.	Nad olid nagu meie.
My wife will get the house and money.	Mu naine saab maja ja raha.
We are doing good.	Meil läheb hästi.
Why, you are also a good person at home.	Miks, kodus olete ka hea inimene.
They didn't know and it's that easy.	Nad ei teadnud ja see on nii lihtne.
But the work is really hard.	Aga töö on tõesti raske.
We get it all.	Me saame seda kõike.
You're not saying?	Sa ei ütle?
I know more than you do.	Ma tean rohkem kui sina.
They didn't go up.	Nad ei läinud üles.
It wasn't human.	See ei olnud inimene.
It looked good.	See nägi hea välja.
He thought he was ready.	Ta arvas, et on valmis.
It's usually busy.	Tavaliselt on see hõivatud.
He's just too hard.	Ta on lihtsalt liiga raske.
I don't want to do that anymore.	Ma ei taha seda enam teha.
Did he do it.	Kas ta tegi teda.
Soon he couldn't even speak.	Varsti ei suutnud ta isegi rääkida.
Like you.	Nagu sina.
I'm just going out.	Ma lähen lihtsalt välja.
There is still a lot to do.	Teha on veel palju.
He can stay.	Ta võib jääda.
He asked for money.	Ta küsis raha.
I don't like it.	Mulle see ei meeldi.
But there is no one here.	Aga siin pole kedagi.
Is it even human ?.	Kas see on isegi inimene?.
Or if he did, he didn't do anything about it.	Või kui tegi, siis ei teinud ta sellega midagi.
Can anyone please help.	Kas keegi saaks palun aidata.
It was good and bad.	See oli hea ja halb.
But not so easy.	Aga mitte nii lihtne.
But no, not before.	Aga ei, mitte varem.
We're almost done!	Oleme peaaegu valmis!
But it was as big as.	Aga see oli suur kui.
What could he do?	Mida ta võiks teha.
Don't tell me.	Ära ütle mulle.
Only you don't know it yet.	Ainult sina ei tea seda veel.
And only when something happens.	Ja ainult siis, kui midagi toimub.
He didn't even have time for that.	Tal polnud isegi selleks aega.
To see him.	Et teda näha.
Maybe that was my problem.	Võib-olla oli see minu probleem.
I don't know how it will turn out.	Ma ei tea, kuidas see välja tuleb.
It was actually pretty.	See oli tegelikult päris ilus.
He knew it.	Ta teadis sellest.
In particular,.	Eriti, .
By the end of the day, he's tired.	Päeva lõpuks on ta väsinud.
I don't think he even likes him.	Ma arvan, et ta isegi ei meeldi talle.
This is interesting.	See on huvitav.
He always has been.	Ta on alati olnud.
I just want to help you.	Ma tahan sind lihtsalt aidata.
It was nothing.	Sellest polnud midagi.
So maybe it happened.	Nii et võib-olla juhtus nii.
Then he looked back at him.	Siis vaatas ta talle tagasi.
Like he heard something.	Nagu ta oleks midagi kuulnud.
I knew if not who.	Teadsin siis, kui mitte kes.
He's not alone.	Ta pole üks.
Only then did he look down.	Alles siis vaatas ta alla.
I know you are.	Ma tean, et sa oled.
But we didn't.	Aga me ei teinud seda.
I'm going to leave you.	Ma lähen sind minema.
But it should be.	Aga see peaks olema.
It seemed to be.	Tundus, et peab olema.
I'm here now.	Ma olen nüüd siin.
I can't even talk.	Ma ei saa isegi rääkida.
That's your way.	See on sinu tee.
You are a happy man.	Sa oled õnnelik mees.
It must have been something, he told himself.	See pidi midagi olema, ütles ta endale.
Very interesting really.	Väga huvitav tõesti.
He saw me.	Ta nägi mind.
Finally, my father spoke.	Lõpuks rääkis mu isa.
She's afraid of me.	Kardab minu pärast.
That was how he had been.	Nii ta oli olnud.
I was pretty surprised.	Olin päris üllatunud.
I didn't understand what was going on.	Ma ei saanud aru, mis toimub.
All this was too much for him.	Seda kõike sai tema jaoks liiga palju.
I never thought it was you.	Ma poleks kunagi arvanud, et see oled sina.
I know what you're doing.	Ma tean, mida sa teed.
That's what he thought.	Seda ta arvas.
He's not doing anything to us.	Ta ei tee meile midagi.
He doesn't remember that.	Ta ei mäleta seda.
I don't see a mistake.	Ma ei näe viga.
It was neither too difficult nor too easy.	See ei olnud liiga raske ega ka liiga lihtne.
They really don't.	Nad tõesti ei tee seda.
I think it would never have been there.	Ma arvan, et see poleks kunagi seal olnud.
But immediately after you comes his teacher.	Aga kohe pärast sind tuleb tema õpetaja.
And then he could.	Ja siis ta võiks.
He's just himself.	Ta lihtsalt on tema ise.
Although this is not the case.	Kuigi see pole nii.
Maybe nothing should be done right now.	Võib-olla ei peaks praegu midagi tegema.
But this boy.	Aga see poiss.
I can handle it.	Ma saan sellega hakkama.
I will never see you again.	Ma ei näe kunagi rohkem.
This is not something you can buy.	See pole midagi, mida saate osta.
Do you do it yourself? 	Kas sa teed seda ise?
He speaks it well.	Ta räägib seda hästi.
It is very difficult for me to do that.	Minu jaoks on seda väga raske teha.
That was not who he was.	See ei olnud see, kes ta oli.
That was exactly the case.	See oli täpselt nii.
And not too much.	Ja mitte liiga.
Maybe a little earlier.	Võib-olla veidi varem.
I find that pretty interesting.	Minu arvates on see päris huvitav.
I am life.	ma olen elu.
That's not very good.	See ei ole väga hea.
This is for me.	See on minu jaoks.
Maybe he did too.	Võib-olla oli tal ka.
He knew it wouldn't be.	Ta teadis, et see ei oleks nii.
Now everything works as it should.	Nüüd töötab kõik nii nagu peab.
I'm as happy as we are.	Ma olen nii õnnelik nagu me oleme.
And he's gone soon.	Ja ta on varsti läinud.
But he didn't just talk.	Kuid ta ei rääkinud ainult.
It is very beautiful.	See on väga ilus.
He doesn't like you.	Sa ei meeldi talle.
And then he talked more.	Ja siis ta rääkis rohkem.
He was like that.	Ta oli nii.
He said he would make things right.	Ta ütles, et teeb kõik korda.
Never been.	Pole kunagi olnud.
We do not speak the same language.	Me ei räägi sama keelt.
This is my job.	See on minu töö.
Certainly not.	Kindlasti ei ole.
How he spoke.	Kuidas ta rääkis.
And it's definitely good.	Ja kindlasti on see hea.
Not so sure.	Pole nii kindel.
Everything that was there.	Kõik, mis seal oli.
You can't do that.	Sa ei saa seda nii teha.
He seemed better for it.	Ta tundus selle jaoks parem.
Not much to see.	Pole palju näha.
More people came in.	Sisse tuli rohkem inimesi.
Can anyone help me?	Kas keegi saab mind aidata?
That is something we need to do.	See on midagi, mida me peame tegema.
That must be what he thought.	See peab nii olema, kui ta nii arvas.
I was the man.	Mina olin see mees.
I wanted.	Ma tahtsin.
Come on, come on.	Tule nüüd, tule nüüd.
He may have it.	Tal võib see olla.
I couldn't get in.	Ma ei saanud sisse.
But there are no problems after that.	Kuid pärast seda pole probleeme.
It actually happens.	See tegelikult juhtub.
He had a job and he managed it.	Tal oli töö ja ta sai sellega hakkama.
Especially that.	Eriti see.
I couldn't help her.	Ma ei saanud teda aidata.
And he got it.	Ja ta sai selle.
He was the man.	Tema oli see mees.
But that would be bad.	Aga see oleks halb.
I didn't know that.	Ma ei teadnud sellest.
My father or me.	Minu isa või mina.
I really don't want to do anything about it.	Ma tõesti ei taha midagi peale selle teha.
If you have a problem, we have a problem.	Kui teil on probleem, on probleem ka meil.
But come in.	Aga tule sisse.
No, that's none of my business.	Ei, see pole minu asi.
It's usually not just one simple thing.	Tavaliselt pole see ainult üks lihtne asi.
Although they didn't look like that, he knew what they were.	Kuigi nad ei näinud välja nagu see, teadis ta, mis need on.
I don't know what they were.	Ma ei tea, mis need olid.
He knew who he was and why he came.	Ta teadis, kes ta on ja miks ta tuli.
How can this be?	Kuidas see saab olla?
But if it were true.	Aga kui see tõsi oleks.

But there was no time for that.	Aga selleks polnud aega.

He has nothing of it.	Tal ei ole sellest midagi.
They were surprised.	Nad olid üllatunud.
About you and me.	Sinust ja minust.
That may be true.	See võib tõsi olla.
It's your fault.	See on sinu viga.
I can't believe he's doing this to you.	Ma ei suuda uskuda, et ta seda sinuga teeb.
And it works.	Ja see töötab.

I wanted my life back.	Ma tahtsin oma elu tagasi.

I don't want to see anyone.	Ma ei taha kedagi näha.
I'm afraid there's nothing good.	Ma kardan, et pole midagi head.
He just doesn't know.	Ta lihtsalt ei tea.
Inside us.	Meie sisse.
When he saw my father.	Kui ta mu isa nägi.
We don't really know what happened.	Me ei tea tegelikult, mis juhtus.
I didn't understand that.	Ma ei saanud sellest aru.
That's not to say it's the case.	Ei ütle, et see nii on.

There is a lot to do.	Teha on palju.
My mother is very busy right now.	Mu ema on praegu väga hõivatud.
I hope it was good for you too.	Loodan, et see oli ka teile hea.

He was a good man.	Ta oli hea mees.
I'll still get over it.	Ma saan sellest ikka üle.
I haven't done anything good here.	Ma pole siin midagi head teinud.
He would do it.	Ta teeks seda.
I have to do more.	Ma pean rohkem tegema.
I was just like that.	Ma olin lihtsalt nii.
But it's not really a big deal.	Aga see pole tegelikult suur asi.
I don't know what they are.	Ma ei tea, mis need on.
I only have one left.	Mul on ainult üks alles.
I couldn't believe it.	Ma ei suutnud seda uskuda.

I do not know anything about it.	Ma ei tea sellest midagi.
There are three ways here.	Siin on kolm võimalust.
No, nothing yet.	Ei, veel mitte midagi.

He probably can't handle it.	Ta ilmselt ei saa sellega hakkama.
That's right, he said.	Nii tundub, ütles ta.
Is he still waiting for him?	Kas ta ootab teda veel praegu.
But now he was fine, he told himself again.	Aga nüüd oli tal hästi, ütles ta endale uuesti.
And no one has ever seen it.	Ja keegi pole seda kunagi näinud.
He didn't want him anymore, he didn't want to.	Ta ei tahtnud teda enam, ta ei tahtnud.
I don't think he did.	Ma arvan, et ta ei teinud seda.
And if not known.	Ja kui pole teada.
This is not a problem.	See pole probleem.
How are you.	Kuidas sul läheb.
They are really worried.	Nad on tõesti mures.
I'm not out.	ma pole väljas.
You were never there.	Sa ei olnud kunagi seal.
He made fire.	Ta tegi tule.
And so it really was.	Ja nii see tõesti oli.
There's nothing we can do about him.	Me ei saa temaga midagi teha.
She is my wife.	Ta on minu naine.

But he wasn't, and he didn't.	Aga ta ei olnud ja ta ei teinud seda.
As much as you want.	Nii palju kui tahad.
That's true enough.	See on piisavalt tõsi.
Here's what you need to do.	Siin on, mida sa tegema pead.
If it works for you, it works.	Kui see töötab teie jaoks, siis see töötab.
He was like the first.	Ta oli nagu esimene.

What's wrong with you? 	Mis sul viga on?
he asked.	ta küsis.
It's definitely someone.	Kindlasti on see keegi.
And he had no idea what to expect.	Ega tal polnud aimugi, mida oodata.

He's doing well.	Tal läheb hästi.
And more.	Ja veel.
Life is now.	Elu on praegu.
He had never done this before.	Ta polnud seda kunagi varem teinud.
You've done it.	Sa oled seda teinud.
He knew about it.	Ta teadis seda kohta.
You know best.	Sina tead kõige paremini.
I know everyone is busy.	Ma tean, et kõik on hõivatud.
So he's better off with a little money than nothing.	Nii et tal on parem natuke raha kui mitte midagi.
I think that's true.	Ma arvan, et see on tõsi.
If you don't have it, you won't understand it.	Kui teil seda pole, ei saa te sellest aru.
He had been so sure.	Ta oli olnud nii kindel.
But too much is definitely not good.	Kuid liiga palju pole kindlasti hea.
Is there anything else? 	Kas on veel midagi?
the woman asked.	küsis naine.
He never knew exactly what did.	Ta ei teadnud kunagi, mis selle täpselt tegi.
The problem is that they are not.	Probleem on selles, et nad ei ole.
There was only one reason for this.	Selleks oli ainult üks põhjus.
If he does, he can win.	Kui ta seda teeb, võib ta võita.
I'm sure you can.	Olen kindel, et saab.
Nobody really does that.	Keegi ei tee seda tõesti.
Or he may realize that the first one was for him.	Või võib ta aru saada, et esimene oli tema jaoks.
That's pretty good.	See on päris hea.
The house is quite large.	Maja on üsna suur.
Like, I really like it.	Nagu, väga meeldib.
You need to talk to me about this.	Sa pead minuga sellest rääkima.
They are good at it.	Nad on selles head.
To do it.	Et seda teha.
She was her.	Naine oli tema.
Then this, then this.	Siis see, siis see.
He wasn't even sure if he could say anything.	Ta polnud isegi kindel, kas oskab midagi öelda.
Just not really my thing.	Lihtsalt pole päris minu asi.
He didn't do it.	Ta ei teinud seda.
Just too long.	Lihtsalt liiga kaua.
He's just a friend.	Ta on lihtsalt sõber.
What he thought he was doing.	Mida ta arvas, et ta tegi.
So that's it.	Nii et see on see.
That may be so.	See võib nii olla.
He knew he could say no.	Ta teadis, et võib öelda ei.
I can do something for you.	Ma saan sinu heaks midagi teha.
It all has to go.	See kõik peab minema.
You really don't.	Sa tõesti mitte.
I know this is true.	Ma tean, et see on tõsi.
He didn't understand what was going on.	Ta ei saanud aru, mis toimub.
That is the reason.	See on põhjus.
I know it's not easy, but you can look good.	Ma tean, et see pole lihtne, kuid saate selle hea välja näha.
What, he didn't know.	Mida, ta ei teadnud.
Doesn't look good.	Ei näe hea välja.
Now that they were together, he didn't know what to do.	Nüüd, kui nad koos olid, ei teadnud ta, mida teha.
He didn't say anyone.	Ta ei öelnud, et keegi.
And he's my friend.	Ja ta on mu sõber.
It's so interesting.	See on nii huvitav.
Maybe too much.	Võib-olla liiga palju.
He knows me too well.	Ta tunneb mind liiga hästi.
No, not so good.	Ei, mitte nii hea.
Really, they are.	Tõesti, nad on.
He was not a friend.	Ta ei olnud sõber.
He had no idea where this one came from.	Tal polnud aimugi, kust see üks tuli.
It's pretty simple.	See on üsna lihtne.
I think it worked out in the end.	Ma arvan, et see läks lõpuks korda.
There was nothing left.	Mitte midagi ei jäänud.
I've seen too much, not too much.	Ma olen liiga palju näinud, mitte liiga.
Who is this man?	Kes see mees on ?
She's scared of me.	Ta kardab mind.
I don't want to be late.	Ma ei taha hiljaks jääda.
It's mine, you know.	See on minu oma, tead.
I don't like it here.	Mulle siin ei meeldi.
You just were.	Sa lihtsalt olid.
And then they don't.	Ja siis nad ka mitte.
It's hard to see.	Seda on raske näha.
I know what it does.	Ma tean, mida see teeb.
A little while ago.	Natuke aega tagasi.
I never thought it would happen to me.	Ma poleks kunagi arvanud, et see minuga juhtub.
Like pretty good interesting.	Nagu päris hea huvitav.
Time is running out too fast.	Aeg läheb liiga kiiresti.
Apparently they hadn't done it.	Ilmselt polnud nad seda teinud.
I don't even know mine.	Ma isegi ei tea oma.
He's here now.	Ta on praegu siin.
We have to say this many times.	Mitu korda peame seda ütlema.
Just told me.	Just ütles mulle.
he asked.	ta küsis.
He just didn't tell me.	Ta lihtsalt ei öelnud mulle.
Now that it had happened, he said nothing.	Nüüd, kui see juhtus, ei öelnud ta midagi.
I'm not entirely alone in this.	Ma ei ole selles täiesti üksi.
Always exactly three.	Alati täpselt kolm.
But that's not the case here.	Kuid siin see nii ei ole.
Could do it.	Saaks hakkama.
There is simply no way.	Lihtsalt pole võimalust.
There was only one thing for that.	Selle jaoks oli ainult üks asi.
I know someone died.	Ma tean, et keegi suri.
It was never a problem for me.	Minu jaoks polnud see kunagi probleem.
You should be out there.	Sa peaksid seal väljas olema.
But he is a very good teacher.	Aga ta on väga hea õpetaja.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Kes ja kus, kuidas ja miks, millal ja mida.
I was most surprised.	Olin kõige rohkem üllatunud.
He has never seen her before.	Ta pole teda kunagi varem näinud.
You told me that.	Sa ütlesid mulle seda.
Looks like he can't do it.	Tundub, et ta ei saa hakkama.
I like him a lot.	Ta meeldib mulle väga.
That's exactly what he wants to do with it.	See on täpselt see, mida ta sellega teha tahab.
Nothing like that.	Ei midagi sellist.
There was always more to get.	Alati oli rohkem saada.
We have enough.	Meil on piisavalt.
Nobody knows where he went.	Keegi ei tea, kuhu ta läks.
Both were more.	Mõlemad olid rohkem.
No, you don't have to do everything yourself.	Ei, te ei pea kõike ise tegema.
I don't know what will happen.	Ma ei tea, mis saab.
Why is he doing this?	Miks ta seda teeb?
He's been without it for too long.	Ta on liiga kaua ilma olnud.
Believe me, it actually works.	Usu mind, see tegelikult töötab.
He's always late.	Ta jääb alati hiljaks.
That time was my father's.	See kell oli mu isa oma.
I really did.	Ma tõesti tegin.
It is true.	See on tõsi.
Then we have	Siis on meil.
That was all for him.	See oli tema jaoks kõik.
Here's the problem with that.	Siin on probleem sellega.
I do it to get by.	Ma teen seda selleks, et hakkama saada.

Better here than outside.	Parem siin kui väljas.
That's right.	See on nii.
We are.	Me oleme.
But they said where.	Aga nad ütlesid, kus.
After all, everything went well.	Pärast läks kõik hästi.
But they are not, they are against it.	Aga nad ei ole, nad on selle vastu.
He wasn't sure he was ready.	Ta polnud kindel, kas ta oli selleks valmis.
They didn't know he was here yet.	Nad ei teadnud veel, et ta siin on.
In the morning he felt better.	Hommikul tundis ta end paremini.

But not about that.	Sellest aga mitte.
It was a woman.	See oli naine.
You know where you want to eat, just tell me.	Sa tead, kus sa süüa tahad, lihtsalt ütle mulle.
It still did.	See ikka tegi seda.

He doesn't know why he says that.	Ta ei tea, miks ta seda ütleb.

Good, good.	Hästi, hästi.
There were too many people now.	Nüüd oli inimesi liiga palju.
If he's here, fine.	Kui ta on siin, siis hästi.
But here it is.	Siin aga on.
We are here to work.	Oleme siin selleks, et teha tööd.
He may be busy.	Ta võib olla hõivatud.

A couple of things happened this week.	Sel nädalal juhtus paar asja.
It had to be easy.	See pidi olema lihtne.
He's your friend.	Ta on sinu sõber.
But that was not the case.	See aga nii ei olnud.
We can do it all.	Me saame seda kõike teha.
It seemed like it was time to do it.	Tundus, et oli aeg seda teha.
He didn't understand what was going on.	Ta ei saanud aru, mis toimub.

If so, we have had it.	Kui see nii on, on see meil olnud.
I'm not a beautiful woman.	Ma ei ole ilus naine.

I have one here.	Mul on üks siin.
I only saw him yesterday.	Ma nägin teda alles eile.
I've done things.	Olen asju teinud.

It happened this year.	See juhtus sel aastal.

I didn't expect that to be the case.	Ma ei oodanud, et see nii on.
And it went well.	Ja see läks hästi.

Good for him.	Hea talle.
I'm sure of that.	Olen selles kindel.
This seems to always be true.	See näib olevat alati tõsi.
I wanted to leave.	Ma tahtsin lahkuda.
He finally had what he wanted.	Lõpuks oli tal see, mida ta tahtis.
They really don't want to leave.	Nad tõesti ei taha lahkuda.
Which he certainly was.	Mida ta kindlasti oli.
He actually did it, so he did it.	Ta tegi seda tegelikult, nii et ta tegi seda.
He had a job to do.	Tal oli tööd teha.
And it's probably good that he's not doing it.	Ja see on ilmselt hea, et ta seda ei tee.
This is a big mistake.	See on suur viga.
I know you want to.	Ma tean, et sa tahad.
Not too old.	Mitte liiga vana.
It should have been his.	See oleks pidanud olema tema oma.
Why did he come here.	Miks ta siia tuli.
He didn't understand why.	Ta ei saanud aru, miks.

I couldn't do it.	Ma ei saanud hakkama.
It was never a friend of mine.	See ei olnud minuga kunagi sõber.
Or if there's someone there.	Või kui seal on keegi.
But there may be a way.	Aga seal võib olla tee.
I thought he was just late.	Arvasin, et ta lihtsalt jäi hiljaks.
Apparently he got over it.	Ilmselt sai ta sellest üle.
There is still a lot to do.	Palju asju on veel vaja teha.
That's good the way you do it.	See on hea, kuidas sa teed.
he thought.	ta arvas.
He wasn't quite sure why he came here tonight.	Ta ei olnud päris kindel, miks ta täna õhtul siia tuli.
Maybe then he would.	Võib-olla siis ta oleks.
They haven't told me anything.	Nad pole mulle midagi öelnud.
Here and here.	Siin ja siin.
But that is what we have.	Aga see on see, mis meil on.
If he didn't want to do anything, he didn't.	Kui ta midagi teha ei tahtnud, siis ta seda ei teinud.
The money is all gone.	Raha on kõik läinud.
But maybe that wasn't true.	Aga võib-olla see polnud tõsi.
But it's almost as easy as it gets.	See on aga peaaegu sama lihtne, kui see tuleb.

How it must be.	Kuidas see olema peab.

We're ready to go.	Oleme valmis minema.
I can't stay.	Ma ei saa jääda.

Like your father before you.	Nagu su isa enne sind.
We have nothing of that.	Meil pole sellest midagi.
I wanted to do a little damage.	Tahtsin natuke kahju teha.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Kuid tundub, et see pole nii.
He seemed.	Ta tundus.
But here he was.	Aga siin ta oli.
But we don't have it.	Aga meil pole seda.
I don't know myself.	Ma ise ei tea.
I'm here, that's the point.	Ma olen siin, asi on selles.

We don't understand that.	Me ei saa sellest aru.
They never could.	Nad ei suutnud seda kunagi.

Maybe that's what he says.	Võib-olla on see nii, nagu ta seda ütleb.
Who it is we think we should be.	Kes see on meie arvates peaksime olema.
No, that wasn't true either.	Ei, ka see polnud tõsi.
Will definitely be back.	Tuleb kindlasti tagasi.

He would have liked the house.	Talle oleks see maja meeldinud.

I didn't go with him.	Ma ei käinud temaga.
I hope you can handle it	Loodan, et saate sellega hakkama

I just want to be sure	Ma tahan lihtsalt kindel olla

And it will never be.	Ja jääb kunagi olema.
But that would not be the case anymore.	Enam see aga nii ei oleks.
There was something in the house he knew about it.	Maja seal oli midagi, mida ta teadis sellest.
But that was then.	Aga see oli siis.
I just don't know how to do my job.	Ma lihtsalt ei tea, kuidas oma tööd teha.
He never did.	Ta ei teinud seda kunagi.
He has no idea.	Tal pole aimugi.
Up or down.	Üles või alla.
It happened.	See juhtus.
No one has ever heard of it.	Keegi pole sellest kunagi kuulnud.
It had to be.	See pidi olema.
It wasn't as it should be.	See ei olnud nii nagu peaks.
But something is better than nothing.	Kuid midagi on parem kui mitte midagi.
And he did it.	Ja ta sai sellega hakkama.
I should do more.	Ma peaksin rohkem tegema.
He did it to me.	Ta tegi seda mulle.
Besides, not much is known about it.	Peale selle pole sellest palju teada.
He just knew he needed it.	Ta lihtsalt teadis, et tal on seda vaja.
He didn't know what he was saying.	Ta ei teadnud, mida ta ütles.
All of them are just good.	Kõik need on lihtsalt head.
It was up to me now.	See oli nüüd minu teha.
Come to me.	Tule minu juurde.
He didn't even know.	Ta isegi ei teadnud.
That doesn't seem to be the case.	Tundub, et see pole nii.
He didn't hear.	Ta ei kuulnud.
I don't know what's going on there.	Ma ei tea, mis seal toimub.
He did it all alone.	Ta tegi seda kõike üksi.
He's good, but not that good.	Ta on hea, aga mitte nii hea.
More than nothing.	Rohkem kui mitte midagi.
I think this is a big mistake.	Ma arvan, et see on suur viga.
He had.	Tal oli.
I shouldn't go yet.	Ma ei peaks veel minema.
Not looking forward to it.	Ei oota seda.
He's back there.	Ta on seal tagasi.
Will be.	Saab olema.
Now everything works.	Nüüd kõik töötab.
There weren't many of us.	Meid ei olnud palju.
Not me.	Mitte mina.
And someone did.	Ja keegi tegi.
Tell him that.	Ütle talle seda.
He was almost finished.	Ta oli peaaegu lõpetanud.
It was so interesting.	See oli nii huvitav.
He hadn't had a chance to eat yet.	Tal polnud veel võimalust süüa saanud.
It's not that much help.	Sellest pole nii palju abi.
Me, he said.	Mina, ütles ta.
It was time to leave.	Oli aeg lahkuda.
Nothing there either.	Ka seal pole midagi.
This guy doesn't.	See mees ei tee seda.
Above all, he wanted to go with him.	Üle kõige tahtis ta temaga kaasa minna.
That is not the case.	See pole nii.
Which works for me.	Mis töötab minu jaoks.
He couldn't talk.	Ta ei saanud rääkida.
But they were together.	Aga nad olid koos.
Buy today.	Osta juba täna.
I didn't make that mistake.	Ma ei teinud seda viga.
I needed to see.	Mul oli vaja näha.
He may need it.	Tal võib seda vaja minna.
He didn't know how much until he saw him there.	Ta ei teadnud, kui palju, enne kui ta teda seal nägi.
This was still the case.	Nii oli ka praegu.
I know that.	Ma tean seda.
Same, but not the same.	Sama, aga mitte sama.
But they have gone home.	Aga nad on koju läinud.
Has to be.	Peab olema.
I don't know where he came from.	Ma ei tea, kust ta tuli.
Everything that happens is for your own good.	Kõik, mis juhtub, on teie enda heaks.
I really don't understand that.	Ma tõesti ei saa sellest aru.
He then went out.	Ta läks siis välja.
But it never did.	Aga seda ei teinud kunagi.
I think it was great.	Ma arvan, et see oli suur.
He does it to see what you're doing.	Ta teeb seda selleks, et näha, mida sa teed.
I can't live in it.	Ma ei saa selles elada.
But he didn't go out.	Aga ta ei käinud eriti väljas.
But it will be difficult.	See saab aga olema raske.
Nobody knows who's coming back yet.	Keegi ei tea veel, kes tagasi tuleb.
Are you still there 	Oled sa veel seal?
the woman asked.	küsis naine.
Worried, but ready.	Mures, aga valmis.
Then he didn't believe it.	Siis ta ei uskunud seda.
He's not right now.	Ka tema pole praegu.
He's already gone.	Ta on juba läinud.
He finally came back to me.	Lõpuks tuli ta minu juurde tagasi.
But that was the problem.	See oli aga probleem.
I was worried.	Olin mures.
Not until he said what he had to say.	Alles enne, kui ta ütles, mis tal öelda oli.
I don't even want to know.	Ma isegi ei taha teada.
I just don't see it that way.	Ma lihtsalt ei näe seda nii.
I do not know what to do.	Ma ei tea, mida teha.
He knew me and my job.	Ta tundis mind ja minu tööd.
I 'm not wrong.	Ma ei saa viga.
Only you and me.	Ainult sina ja mina.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Ma ei tea, kas see on tõsi või mitte.
It was me.	See olin mina.
Now it's time to go to bed.	Nüüd on aeg magama minna.
Everything is the same.	Kõik on sama.
That's to be expected.	See võiks oodata.
It wasn't a big house.	See ei olnud suur maja.
You knew that, too.	Sa teadsid seda ka.
He was pretty sure he was dead.	Ta oli üsna kindel, et ta suri.
No one can help it.	Keegi ei saa seda aidata.
He had nowhere else to go.	Tal polnud enam kohta, kuhu minna.
They're not telling me anything.	Nad ei räägi mulle midagi.
You don't know.	Sa ei tea.
He has done this before.	On seda varem teinud.
Stop talking like that.	Ära enam nii räägi.
This is really happening.	Seda tõesti juhtub.
Tell him what you told me, "he said.	Ütle talle, mida sa mulle ütlesid," ütles ta.
I'm the first to tell you about myself.	Ma olen esimene, kes teile seda enda kohta räägib.
We will not do that.	Seda me ei tee.
But he just had to say it.	Aga ta lihtsalt pidi seda ütlema.
That it couldn't be.	Et see ei saanud olla.
This is someone who knew him.	See on keegi, kes teda tundis.
Now he really knows.	Nüüd ta tõesti teab.
Nothing to do.	Ei tee midagi.
It wasn't a big deal.	See polnud suur asi.
I thought it would be interesting.	Arvasin, et see oleks huvitav.
You are with me now.	Nüüd oled sa minuga.
This is a big problem.	See on suur probleem.
Now he saw something, but not what.	Nüüd nägi ta midagi, aga mitte mida.
That's it.	See on see.
Here's another reason.	Siin on veel üks põhjus, miks.
Not easy, never easy.	Pole lihtne, mitte kunagi lihtne.
He wanted that too.	Ta tahtis ka seda.
I wanted to be there myself.	Tahtsin ise seal olla.
That is certainly not a reason not to do so.	See pole kindlasti põhjus, miks seda mitte teha.
It seemed to work.	Tundus, et see töötab.
I never did that, so it was good.	Ma pole seda kunagi teinud, nii et see oli hea.
It was good when it was just me.	See oli hea, kui olin ainult mina.
His mother could not say what he had just said.	Tema ema ei saanud öelda, mida ta just ütles.
Just then and right there.	Just siis ja just seal.
I wish you shouldn't.	Soovin, et sa ei peaks.
I can't tell what's going on.	Ma ei oska öelda, mis toimub.
He definitely needed the money.	Tal oli kindlasti raha vaja.
More like.	Rohkem nagu.
I didn't hear anything.	Ma ei kuulnud midagi.
So that's great.	Nii et see on suur.
I think it looks better.	Ma arvan, et see näeb parem välja.
I never understood that.	Ma ei saanud sellest kunagi aru.
I'm sure not.	Ma olen kindel, et ei ole.
Like no one at home.	Nagu poleks kedagi kodus.
But it does.	Aga see teeb.
He couldn't have done it.	Ta poleks saanud teha.
I'm doing well.	Ma teen seda hästi.
And that's good.	Ja see on hea.
He was his own and his alone.	Ta oli tema oma ja tema üksi.
So we have to fix it.	Nii et me peame selle korda tegema.
No need to do it again.	Pole vaja seda uuesti teha.
Who is willing to do anything and anyone.	Kes on nõus kõike ja kedagi tegema.
There was never anything there.	Seal polnud kunagi midagi.
Everything he knew was true.	Kõik, mida ta teadis, oli see tõsi.
Really don't.	Tõesti ei tee.
A little about it, a little about it.	Natuke sellest, natuke sellest.
Better not.	Parem on mitte.
We are where we are.	Oleme seal, kus oleme.
There was more here.	Siin oli rohkem.
I'd like to go again.	Tahaks uuesti minna.
Come here.	Tule siia.
Wait, he says.	Oota, ütleb ta.
I think you are very happy.	Ma arvan, et sa oled väga õnnelik.
Not even tonight.	Isegi mitte täna õhtul.
I didn't see it.	Ma ei näinud seda.
You are.	Sa oled.
I do not want it.	ma ei taha seda.
But it was too hard.	Aga see oli liiga raske.
It used to be much better.	Varem oli see palju parem.
I'm not with him.	Ma ei ole temaga.
They're not mothers.	Nad ei ema.
But they are not ours.	Aga nad ei ole meie.
I'm so happy to tell you that.	Mul on nii hea meel teile seda öelda.
But I can't do that.	Aga ma ei saa seda teha.
He can live again.	Ta saab uuesti elada.
I have to go home.	Ma pean koju minema.
It was really interesting.	See oli tõesti huvitav.
We have seen it.	Oleme seda näinud.
In fact, I didn't particularly like them.	Tegelikult mulle need eriti ei meeldinud.
Now is his chance.	Nüüd on tal selleks võimalus.
She is still a woman.	Ta on endiselt naine.
That's it.	See on siis see.
He is a man.	Ta on mees.
It's not the same thing at all.	See pole üldse sama asi.
Can anyone help me.	Kas keegi saab mind aidata.
Someone is doing it.	Keegi teeb seda.
But all is well.	Aga kõik hea.
Is that what you do.	Kas see on see, mida sa teed.
They had gone down together.	Nad olid koos alla läinud.
He wanted to say that.	Ta tahtis seda öelda.
We just aren't.	Me lihtsalt ei ole.
But we weren't here.	Aga meie siin ei olnud.
Now here's the problem.	Nüüd on siin probleem.
He never goes out.	Ta ei lähe kunagi välja.
I've been to.	Olen käinud.
To talk.	Et rääkida.
I really hope you want it.	Ma tõesti loodan, et sa tahad seda.
What it is not.	Mida see ei ole.

The most.	Kõige rohkem.

It actually works very well.	See töötab tegelikult ka väga hästi.
You tell me.	Sina ütle mulle.

He didn't want her.	Ta ei tahtnud teda.
There is not much to say about this.	Selle kohta pole liiga palju öelda.
This is for you.	See on sulle.

We have been doing this for several years.	Oleme seda teinud juba mitu aastat.
You've done it all.	Olete kõik teinud.

So no one wanted him.	Nii et keegi ei tahtnud teda.

He's really working.	Ta teeb tõesti tööd.
He had never seen anything like it.	Ta polnud kunagi midagi sellist näinud.

He had said he knew her when.	Ta oli öelnud, et ta tundis teda millal.

Father would be back and should go in.	Isa oleks tagasi ja peaks sisse minema.
All the time actually.	Kogu aeg tegelikult.
But that wouldn't have been good.	Aga see poleks olnud hea.
He's not what you want to do for you.	Ta ei ole sinu jaoks, mida sa tahad teha.
He's not the only one hurt.	Ta pole ainus, kes viga sai.
A lot.	Palju.
He said he liked it.	Ta ütles, et talle see meeldib.
I just wanted to tell you.	Tahtsin sulle seda lihtsalt öelda.
That was a good thing.	See oli hea asi.
Don't do it again.	Ära tee seda enam.
He was very surprised.	Ta oli väga üllatunud.
Too ready to go your own way.	Liiga valmis minema oma teed.
They don't do the work for you.	Nad ei tee seda tööd teie eest.
We have to go.	Me peame minema.
He didn't want to come down there.	Ta ei tahtnud sinna alla tulla.
We never knew why.	Me pole kunagi teadnud, miks.
He left for me.	Ta lahkus minu pärast.
He had been there for a few days.	Ta oli seal paar päeva olnud.
He asked if he could come.	Ta küsis, kas võib tulla.
I definitely want him to do that, you know.	Ma kindlasti soovin, et ta seda teeks, tead.
He looked at it, then at me.	Ta vaatas seda, siis mind.
But he got over it pretty quickly.	Kuid ta sai sellest üsna kiiresti üle.
That would be tomorrow.	See oleks homme.
Whether he wants to or not.	Peab, kas ta tahab või mitte.
That's not good.	See ei ole hea.
He finally looked up.	Ta vaatas lõpuks üles.
I had a friend.	Mul oli sõber.
Then he knew what he had to do.	Siis ta teadis, mida ta tegema peab.
There was no one here.	Siin polnud kedagi.
Maybe it was him.	Võib-olla oli see tema.
Like the person he was now.	Nagu inimene, kes ta praegu oli.
As good as we can.	Nii hästi kui meil läheb.
In the end, he does.	Lõpuks ta teeb.
It was simple.	See oli lihtne.
So it was really good for us.	Nii et see oli meile tõesti hea.
They don't see that much.	Nii palju nad ei näe.
I don't understand why.	Ma ei saa aru, miks.
What is this? 	Mis see on?
They can't be.	Nad ei saa olla.
Right after he talked to you.	Kohe pärast seda, kui ta sinuga rääkis.
The problem is that he too.	Probleem on selles, et ka tema.
I just don't know where they are.	Ma lihtsalt ei tea, kus nad on.
I would have done the same thing.	Ma oleksin sama asja teinud.
We definitely have to.	Peame kindlasti.
, itself is.	, ise on.
But don't do it again.	Aga ära tee seda uuesti.
You're not coming out of this.	Sa ei tule sellest välja.
He never said what it was.	Ta ei öelnud kunagi, mis see oli.
She tells me she thought it was beautiful.	Ta ütleb mulle, et tema arvates oli see ilus.
In it you can play like everything.	Selles saate mängida nagu kõike.
It wasn't that long ago.	See ei olnud nii kaua aega tagasi.
That was a big deal.	Need olid suur asi.
I've been there.	Olen seal käinud.
We like what we like.	Meile meeldib see, mis meile meeldib.
I'm not sure.	Ma pole kindel.
This is not the case, as it is for us.	See ei ole nii, mitte nii, nagu see meie jaoks on.
It seemed easy to him.	See tundus talle lihtne.
But this is only one possibility.	Kuid see on ainult üks võimalus.
No, it really is.	Ei, tõesti on.
As it was, he was not.	Nagu oli, ta ei olnud.
He said it was him.	Ta ütles, et see on tema.
It really is.	Tõesti on.
And that's a beautiful thing.	Ja see on ilus asi.
I still hope someone does, but no one is me.	Ma ikka loodan, et keegi teeb, aga keegi ei ole mina.
Unless he remembers more.	Kui ta just rohkem ei mäleta.
Not hard or anything.	Pole raske ega midagi.
He's better where he is.	Tal on parem seal, kus ta on.
It's not here.	See pole siin.
Is it a better person.	Kas see on parem inimene.
He probably didn't.	Tõenäoliselt ta seda ei teinud.
.	.
It's time.	On aeg.
I want to know if she's happy.	Ma tahan teada, kas ta on õnnelik.
Please.	Palun.
They just can't.	Nad lihtsalt ei saa.
But we need to start talking about it.	Aga me peame sellest rääkima hakkama.
And it did.	Ja see tegi seda.
I wasn't so sure.	Ma ei olnud nii kindel.
It was my father.	See oli minu isa.
I had no problem with that.	Mul ei olnud sellega probleeme.
The same thing happened.	Sama asi juhtus.
I just wanted to know if you're doing this.	Tahtsin lihtsalt teada, kas sa seda teed.
Mom just came in and would be home.	Ema tuli lihtsalt sisse ja oleks nagu kodus.
You will be my wife.	Sinust saab mu naine.
There was much more.	Seal oli palju rohkem.
You can do it now.	Saate seda kohe teha.
Don't feel it.	Ära tunne.
Even that is a lot.	Isegi seda on palju.
I told him we wouldn't.	Ütlesin talle, et me seda ei tee.
Like my mother.	Nagu mu ema.
He wasn't happy about it.	Ta ei olnud selle üle õnnelik.
You haven't done that.	Sa pole seda teinud.
We'll find out soon.	Saame varsti teada.
Boy did it work.	Poiss, see sai hakkama.
I don't know exactly why, but that's the way it is.	Ma ei tea täpselt, miks, aga see on nii.
Nobody knows which way to go.	Keegi ei tea, mis teed minna.
She's out.	Ta on väljas.
You don't get better than this.	Sa ei saa seda paremini kui see.
I said no, just a little.	Ma ütlesin, et ei, ainult natuke.
Maybe we don't.	Võib-olla me ei tee seda.
Then come here.	Siis tule siia.
He knew it.	Ta teadis seda.
I'm not even sure if he sees me.	Ma pole isegi kindel, kas ta näeb mind.
And then his whole life.	Ja siis kogu tema elu.
You're better.	Sa oled parem.
Not him, not now.	Mitte tema, mitte praegu.
But I can't say anything about that.	Sellest ei oska aga midagi öelda.
He knew what you were doing.	Ta teadis, mida sa teed.
It's also pretty easy.	See on ka üsna lihtne.
I don't understand exactly what's going on.	Ma ei saa aru, mis täpselt toimub.
Together.	Koos .
If we have it we can't help it.	Kui me peame seda ei saa aidata.
That wasn't it.	See polnud see.
You have to go.	Sa pead minema.
I think so.	Ma arvan, et tuleb.
He didn't really know why.	Ta ei teadnud tegelikult, miks.
There is no time today.	Täna pole aega.
He was such a good father.	Ta oli nii hea isa.
But that was not the case.	See aga nii ei olnud.
You did well.	Sul läks hästi.
You could say it was a mistake.	Võib öelda, et see oli viga.
It was over this morning.	See sai täna hommikul läbi.
Maybe I can handle it.	Võib-olla saan sellega hakkama.
But it didn't agree with you.	Aga see ei olnud sinuga nõus.
But often they don't.	Kuid sageli nad seda ei tee.
My car doesn't do that.	Minu auto ei tee seda.
He didn't see anyone.	Ta ei näinud kedagi.
All this could be done for good.	Seda kõike saaks heaks teha.
It was too big.	See oli liiga suur.
It was yours.	See oli sinu.
I have to do it.	Ma pean seda tegema.
He and his wife.	Tema ja ta naine.
Maybe he was tired.	Võib-olla oli ta väsinud.
Now you hardly talk to him.	Nüüd sa peaaegu ei räägi temaga.
How often this happens is not really known.	Kui sageli see juhtub, pole tegelikult teada.
It's not my job.	See pole minu töö.
They hadn't spoken about it since.	Pärast seda polnud nad sellest rääkinud.
He knew when he would come home.	Ta teadis, millal ta koju tuleb.
I just want to be alone.	Ma tahan lihtsalt üksi olla.
That's all.	See on siis kõik.
The reason for this is quite simple.	Põhjus selleks on üsna lihtne.
He didn't expect that.	Ta ei oodanud seda.
I've never seen anything like it.	Pole kunagi midagi sellist näinud.
Nobody knows what it is.	Keegi ei tea, mis see on.
But it was nothing.	Aga sellest polnud midagi.
But you're not a man.	Aga sa ei ole mees.
And that's good.	Ja see on hea.
He didn't see anything.	Ta ei näinud midagi.
May be tonight.	Võib olla täna õhtul.
He went back in.	Ta läks sisse tagasi.
The money goes well on its own.	Raha läheb ise korda.
All this is happening fast.	Kõik see juhtub kiiresti.
Don't even talk to me.	Ära isegi räägi minuga.
You will definitely like it.	See meeldib teile kindlasti.
When who knew.	Millal kes teadis.
You probably don't think so.	Tõenäoliselt te ei usu, et see nii on.
And don't believe it.	Ja ära usu seda.
That was before my time.	See oli enne minu aega.
It can't be.	See ei saa olla.
That's actually a good thing.	See on tegelikult hea asi.
And we have succeeded.	Ja oleme suutnud.
It had to be done.	Seda tuli teha.
It's easy.	See on lihtne.
He must have had a reason.	Tal oli vist põhjus.
Something for everyone.	Kõigile midagi.
I'm doing great.	Mul läheb hästi.
He can't be ready.	Ta ei saa valmis.
But you just couldn't do it.	Aga sa lihtsalt ei suutnud seda teha.
No one knew where it came from.	Keegi ei teadnud, kust see tuli.
He wanted to go.	Ta tahtis minna.
I'd like to go back.	Tahaks tagasi minna.
He must have been just as surprised.	Ta pidi olema sama üllatunud.
You're there.	Sa oled seal.
But he doesn't believe it.	Aga ta ei usu.
It doesn't have to be a big deal.	See ei pea olema suur asi.
Not old enough to drive.	Pole piisavalt vana, et sõita.
It still is.	On ikka veel.
Why don't you come up and wait outside.	Miks sa ei tule üles ja oota väljas.
But in reality they are not.	Aga tegelikult nad ei ole.
It's going to be easy.	See saab olema lihtne.
He's not really your father.	Ta pole tegelikult su isa.
He's not real.	Ta pole päris.
That you had something to say.	Et sul oli midagi öelda.
I still am.	Olen ikka veel.
You never go out.	Sa ei lähe kunagi välja.
He thought you were doing it.	Ta arvas, et sa seda teed.
I need to work.	Mul on vaja tööd teha.
Seems so.	Tundub nii.
In fact, you can do more than that.	Tegelikult saate teha rohkem kui see.
He's just glad they're back.	Tal on lihtsalt hea meel, et nad tagasi on saanud.
Better believe it.	Parem usu seda.
I look forward to seeing you next year.	Loodan teid järgmisel aastal näha.
She's waiting for me to be there.	Ta ootab, et ma seal oleksin.
He probably should.	Tõenäoliselt peaks ta.
He had heard me.	Ta oli mind kuulnud.
You were there then.	Sa olid siis seal.
I think the car did its job.	Ma arvan, et auto tegi oma töö.
But then it was as good as it should be.	Aga siis oli sama hästi, kui ta peaks.
There is no time for that.	Selleks pole aega.
No time.	Pole aega.
But he said no more.	Aga ta ei öelnud rohkem.
I can't say anything about that.	Ma ei oska selle kohta midagi öelda.
I wanted to say a few things about this.	Tahtsin selle kohta paar asja öelda.
And they can't help.	Ja nad ei saa midagi aidata.
I'm sure you know that.	Olen kindel, et tead seda.
There may be a problem.	Võib olla probleem.
Same thing.	Sama asi.
He said he did not understand.	Ta ütles, et ei saanud aru.
Did he see him again.	Kas ta nägi teda uuesti.
So he came here.	Nii ta siia tuli.
I have a man.	Mul on üks mees.
Not after.	Mitte pärast.
Man could not do it in the end.	Inimene ei suutnud seda lõpuks teha.
But really very good.	Aga tõesti väga hea.
Too much and actually too often.	Liiga palju ja tegelikult liiga sageli.
No one is sure what to do about it.	Keegi pole kindel, mida sellest teha.
I did it myself.	Ma tegin selle ise.
He knew what was what.	Teadis, mis oli mis.
I still have him.	Mul on ta ka alles.
I never did.	Ma ei teinud seda kunagi.
Come on.	Tule nüüd.
So is her mother.	Nii ka tema ema.
Especially this week.	Eriti sel nädalal.
And it's really hard.	Ja see on tõesti raske.
Besides me.	Peale minu.
But they said nothing.	Aga nad ei öelnud midagi.
You can't go yet.	Sa ei saa veel minna.
And then it happened again today.	Ja siis juhtus see täna uuesti.
We don't know what happened.	Me ei tea, mis juhtus.
It was just a feeling.	See oli lihtsalt tunne.
But not in that.	Aga mitte selles.
You don't know what he is.	Sa ei tea, mis ta on.
There are too many here.	Siin on liiga palju.
It's him.	See on tema.
I didn't understand that.	Ma ei saanud sellest aru.
I wonder what happened.	Huvitav, mis juhtus.
And he knew.	Ja ta teadis.
I'm an old man.	Ma olen vana mees.
But he said he saw it.	Aga ta ütles, et näeb seda.
You can do what you like.	Saate teha seda, mis teile meeldib.
It's just hard.	See on lihtsalt raske.
These are one thing.	Need on üks asi.
I wonder what he's done.	Huvitav, mida ta on teinud.
You've been there.	Sa oled seal olnud.
But when they returned, he spoke.	Kui nad aga tagasi olid, rääkis ta.
Here he is.	Siin ta on.
He didn't know it was bad.	Ta ei saanud teada, et see halb on.
But then my father died.	Siis aga suri mu isa.
We have to sleep.	Peame magama.
That would be really bad.	See oleks tõesti halb.
Your mother will go with you.	Su ema läheb sinuga kaasa.
All this to us.	Kõik see meie.
He bought it and left.	Ta ostis selle ja lahkus.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Kuid me ei saa selle vastu midagi teha.
Nobody told him anything.	Keegi ei öelnud talle midagi.
We are not.	Me ei ole.
Or his father's.	Või tema isa oma.
At his home.	Tema kodus.
He was the first there.	Ta oli seal esimene.
It works well.	See töötab hästi.
All day, three days.	Terve päeva, kolm päeva.
He himself was not there.	Teda ise seal polnud.
If so, this.	Kui see, siis see.
Maybe you are too.	Võib-olla oled ka sina.
He's just as happy to see you.	Tal on sama hea meel sind näha.
There he was.	Seal ta oli.
You want it so badly.	Sa tahad seda nii väga.
That's really pretty good.	See on tõesti päris hea.
It's just for him.	Tema jaoks see lihtsalt on.
He knew that too.	Ta teadis ka seda.
That's a really good thing.	See on tõesti hea asi.
No, we don't have enough money for that.	Ei, meil pole selleks piisavalt raha.
Good as a man.	Hea kui mees.
Just wait, he wanted to tell him.	Lihtsalt oota, ta tahtis talle öelda.
He doesn't know who you are yet.	Ta ei tea veel, kes sa oled.
This is not currently the case.	Praegu see nii ei ole.
That would be all.	See oleks kõik.
He wanted to live with you.	Ta tahtis sinuga koos elada.
Nobody saw him.	Keegi ei näinud teda.
I have nothing against it.	Mul pole selle vastu midagi.
That couldn't be true.	See ei saanud tõsi olla.
He hadn't finished.	Ta ei olnud lõpetanud.
Or you don't.	Või sa ei tee seda.
But it probably wouldn't do any good.	Aga sellest ei oleks ilmselt midagi head.
I'm more worried about you.	Ma olen sinu pärast rohkem mures.
Everyone was busy.	Kõik olid hõivatud.
He works it out for himself.	Ta töötab selle enda jaoks välja.
To see you again.	Et sind uuesti näha.
You can buy it today.	Saate selle juba täna osta.
It must be soon.	See peab varsti olema.
No one tells me.	Keegi ei ütle mulle.
He'll never know.	Ta ei saa seda kunagi teada.
So it's hard.	Nii et see on raske.
I said.	Ma ütlesin.
I'm just surprised.	Ma olen lihtsalt üllatunud.
And it wasn't good.	Ja see ei olnud hea.
I'm doing very well.	Mul läheb väga hästi.
Your wife, it's hard.	Sinu naine, see on raske.
I've been waiting long enough.	Olen juba piisavalt kaua oodanud.
I'm afraid of it.	Ma kardan seda.
They did not understand what he had said.	Nad ei saanud aru, mida ta oli öelnud.
Maybe it's better.	Võib-olla on nii parem.
I have to talk about it.	Ma pean sellest rääkima.
I'm doing well as usual.	Saan hästi läbi nagu tavaliselt.
He knew she didn't believe him.	Ta teadis, et naine ei uskunud teda.
Looks like they don't know what to do.	Tundub, et nad ei tea, mida teha.
It's nothing.	See pole midagi.
I know where it is.	Ma tean, kus see on.
And here's the reason.	Ja siin on põhjus.
He gave it to me.	Ta andis selle mulle.
He is not.	Ta ei ole.
I was his friend.	Ma olin ta sõber.
That's how you just are.	See, kuidas sa lihtsalt .
If it didn't go down, it didn't go down.	Kui alla ei läinud, siis ei läinud.
He still couldn't believe it.	Ta ei suutnud seda ikka veel uskuda.
I do it myself.	Ma teen ise.
It could be better.	See võib olla parem.
It's not over yet.	See pole veel läbi.
But he wasn't the only one.	Kuid ta polnud ainuke.
Now we understand.	Nüüd saame aru.
I didn't tell him anything.	Ma ei öelnud talle midagi.
He said earlier.	Varem ütles ta.
To do something.	Et midagi teha.
Only one person and one woman.	Ainult üks inimene ja üks naine.
There is nothing to get.	Midagi pole saada.
He just found out.	Ta sai just teada.
What was he?	Mis ta oli.
That's what my father said.	Nii ütles mu isa.
Don't talk.	Kas ära räägi.
Need to go home.	Vaja koju minna.
The sooner he knew, the better.	Mida varem ta teadis, seda parem.
It's just.	See on ainult.
Now was his chance.	Nüüd oli tema võimalus.
He didn't know where he was or what he was.	Ta ei teadnud, kus ta on või mis ta on.
And we couldn't go back.	Ja me ei saanud tagasi minna.
I'm not telling you anything like that.	Ma ei ütle teile midagi sellist.
What he had.	Mis tal oli.
He had to say something.	Ta pidi midagi ütlema.
We're both gone tomorrow night.	Oleme mõlemad homme õhtul ära.
Don't talk about it anymore.	Ära räägi sellest rohkem.
There is life in it.	Selles on elu.
He just went along with it.	Ta lihtsalt läks sellega kaasa.
I haven't done this before.	Ma pole seda varem teinud.
I think it's best to do it with me then.	Arvan, et kõige parem on teha seda siis minuga.
He didn't tell her anything.	Ta ei öelnud talle midagi.
My wife can't get any more.	Mu naine ei saa rohkem.
He had a job to do.	Tal oli tööd teha.
He looked old.	Ta nägi vana välja.
This is my father.	See on minu isa.
He is our man.	Ta on meie mees.
If he wanted to.	Kui ta tahaks.
It's more the same.	See on rohkem sama.
But that's the way it is.	Aga nii see on.
It's really that simple.	See on tõesti nii lihtne.
I never went back.	Ma ei läinud kunagi tagasi.

Get out of here.	Eest ära.
Everyone said so.	Kõik ütlesid nii.
This path is actually very easy.	See tee on tegelikult väga lihtne.
He wanted to understand and could not.	Ta tahtis aru saada ja ei saanud.
It's a hard feeling.	See on raske tunne.
No, never exactly, he said.	Ei, mitte kunagi täpselt, ütles ta.
But he didn't know it.	Aga ta ei teadnud seda.
There is not much to talk about.	Enda kohta pole palju rääkida.
All this only this year.	Seda kõike ainult sel aastal.
But for me.	Aga minu jaoks.
I have to say it a few times.	Ma pean seda paar korda ütlema.
He just couldn't handle it.	Ta lihtsalt ei saanud hakkama.
It has to be here, it has to be there.	See peab olema siin, see peab olema seal.
I am him.	Mina olen tema.
He just didn't understand.	Ta lihtsalt ei saanud aru.
Or he knew exactly where he was.	Või teadis ta täpselt, kus ta on.
And see why.	Ja on näha, miks.
I'm going down.	Ma lähen alla.
Man.	Mees.
I'm going out tonight.	Lähen täna õhtul välja.
He had done enough.	Ta oli piisavalt teinud.
Now you know why.	Nüüd sa tead, miks.
But no harm.	Aga kahju pole.
I am so happy.	Ma olen nii õnnelik.
I did just that last week.	Tegin just seda eelmisel nädalal.
They are not at home.	Nad ei ole kodus.
They had succeeded.	Nad olid hakkama saanud.
It looks good.	See näeb hea välja.
Now is not our time.	Nüüd pole meie aeg.
We still have some work to do here.	Meil on siin veel natuke tööd teha.
That's pretty much it, that's just me.	See on päris palju, see olen lihtsalt mina.
Now they were gone.	Nüüd olid nad läinud.
It was a life for him.	See oli tema jaoks elu.
You like it.	See meeldib teile.
That's just how it went.	Lihtsalt nii läks.
I think he likes it.	Ma arvan, et ta meeldib talle.
I agree with him.	Olen temaga nõus.
It was me today.	Täna olin see mina.
That was not true either.	Ka see polnud tõsi.
Tell me where he went.	Ütle mulle, kuhu ta läks.
It wasn't like it is now.	See ei olnud nii nagu praegu.
It has been so helpful.	Sellest on nii palju abi olnud.
We couldn't talk here.	Me ei saanud siin rääkida.
It was for his father.	See oli tema isa jaoks.
I hope you can help.	Loodan, et saate aidata.
He couldn't have said that.	Ta poleks saanud seda öelda.
So we're all right.	Nii et meil läheb kõik hästi.
But we didn't know what to do.	Aga me ei teadnud, mida teha.
This is not currently the case.	Praegu see nii ei ole.
He wasn't sure he wanted to.	Ta polnud kindel, kas ta tahab.

I couldn't believe he was doing something like that.	Ma ei suutnud uskuda, et ta midagi sellist teeb.
We can and must do this today.	Seda saame ja peame täna tegema.
So it's not going well for me.	Nii et see ei lähe mulle hästi.
He didn't say that.	Ta ei öelnud seda.
I don't want to stay.	Ma ei taha jääda.
It looks like.	See tundub nagu.
It is true.	See on tõsi.
And you can't get it back.	Ja te ei saa seda tagasi saada.
His mother was not human.	Tema ema ei olnud inimene.
We never got him and he never got us.	Me ei saanud teda kunagi ja tema ei saanud meid.
Here's the problem for me.	Siin on minu jaoks probleem.
But in reality this is not the case.	Kuid tegelikult see nii ei ole.
Good to see that.	Hea seda näha.
Right here.	Just siin.
He was like.	Ta oli nagu.
There's nothing I can do about it.	Ma ei saa ise midagi teha.
It's hard for you to see.	Teil on seda raske näha.
She'll be fine.	Ta saab korda.
I didn't see anyone.	Ma ei näinud kedagi.
This and only this.	See ja ainult see.
They should be as good as they are now.	Need peaksid olema head nagu praegu.
Good if he goes.	Hea, kui ta läheb.
And it was true.	Ja see oli tõsi.
I hope he doesn't.	Loodan, et ta seda ei tee.
Nobody.	Mitte keegi.
I didn't know what he was doing there.	Ma ei teadnud, mida ta seal teeb.
He's not coming in.	Ta ei tule sisse.
The only one who could help him was his friend.	Ainus, kes teda selles aidata sai, oli tema sõber.
I saw it right away.	Ma nägin seda kohe.
But it's nothing.	Aga see pole midagi.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Kuid see ei pea nii olema.
But this is not the only problem.	Kuid see pole ainus probleem.
We have to help.	Me peame aitama.
He could stay.	Ta võiks jääda.
This is for you.	See on teie jaoks.
I could tell.	Mina, võiks öelda.
He did it to me.	Ta tegi seda minuga.
They were not surprised.	Nad ei olnud üllatunud.
Another one gone.	Veel üks läinud.
He did it last year.	Ta tegi seda eelmisel aastal.
We are not interested in that.	Me ei ole sellest huvitatud.
These are the ones that are left.	Need on need, mis on jäänud.
That's what.	See on mis.
Nobody knows who did it.	Keegi ei saa teada, kes seda tegi.
I'm just going.	Ma lihtsalt lähen.
That may be so.	See võib nii olla.
Tell me more.	Räägi mulle rohkem.
Here we have it.	Siin see meil on.
I just do and that's it.	Ma lihtsalt teen ja kõik.
I'm glad he did.	Mul on hea meel, et ta seda tegi.
They said no.	Nad ütlesid ei.
That is not really true.	See pole tegelikult tõsi.
But only if it works.	Aga ainult siis, kui see töötab.
I really like this job.	Mulle väga meeldib see töö.
It seems so at best.	Kõige parem tundub nii.
You can do it the way you want.	Saate teha nii, nagu soovite.
I don't know why this happened.	Ma ei tea, miks see juhtus.
The one who knows he left and the one who doesn't.	See, kes teab, et ta lahkus, ja see, kes ei tea.
Maybe a lot.	Võib-olla palju.
Waiting for us.	Ootab meid.
I'm tired of you.	Ma olen sinust väsinud.
And it was so beautiful.	Ja see oli nii ilus.
But he managed.	Aga ta sai hakkama.
Not tomorrow either.	Ka homme mitte.
I'm just a human being, you know.	Ma olen ainult inimene, tead.
He just wants to go to sleep.	Ta tahab ainult magama minna.
It can wait.	See võib oodata.
Just like he said.	Just nagu ta ütles.
I hadn't heard that either.	Ma polnud ka seda kuulnud.
He just didn't know what it could be.	Ta lihtsalt ei teadnud, mis see olla võiks.
Now that.	Nüüd see.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ei pidanud enam vastu.
We can't get it now.	Me ei saa seda praegu.
Not a woman.	Mitte naine.
No, it's not over yet.	Ei, see pole veel läbi.
That could not be true.	See ei saanud olla tõsi.
I think he's hurt a lot.	Ma arvan, et ta on palju kahju saanud.
The thing is, it can be.	Asi on selles, et see võib olla.
That's what happened to me.	Minuga juhtus nii.
After that, you can do what you want.	Pärast seda saate teha, mida soovite.
He's sorry about that.	Tal on sellest kahju.
He wasn't there.	Teda polnud seal.
I'm not coming down.	Ma ei tule maha.
It happens.	See juhtub.
It's me and you.	See olen mina ja sina.
No one would really oppose it.	Keegi poleks selle vastu tegelikult.
Will this happen.	Kas see juhtub.
But it was good.	Aga hea oli.
You can probably do that.	Tõenäoliselt saate seda teha.
Makes it good.	Teeb selle heaks.
He didn't even know what to say to him.	Ta isegi ei teadnud, mida talle vastu öelda.
I can't say when.	Ma ei oska öelda, millal.
And soon.	Ja seda varsti.
You didn't do it for him.	Sa ei teinud seda tema pärast.
I had nothing to say to him.	Mul polnud talle midagi öelda.
I really want it.	Soovin seda väga.
That was too good for that.	See oli selleks liiga hea.
It's none of my business.	See pole minu asi.
And he needs it a lot.	Ja ta vajab seda palju.
He died, we shouldn't do it.	Ta suri, et me ei peaks seda tegema.
He and her.	Tema ja tema.
This is not the way it should be.	See ei ole nii, nagu see olema peaks.
That's what he wants and he can do it.	Seda ta tahab ja saab sellega hakkama.
It will be over and it will be over quickly.	See saab läbi ja see saab kiiresti läbi.
I do everything.	Ma teen kõike.
Are you.	Kas sa.
They knew where they were.	Nad teadsid, kus need on.
I think we can do it.	Ma arvan, et saame hakkama.
It really happened.	See juhtus tõesti.
Many people.	Palju inimesi.
Especially that.	Eriti see.
I said that's not the case.	Ma ütlesin, et see pole nii.
And looked again.	Ja vaatas uuesti.
It can be yours too.	See võib olla ka sinu oma.
Nobody is just who you are to me.	Keegi pole minu jaoks lihtsalt see, kes sa oled.
It doesn't even have to be anything.	See ei pea isegi midagi olema.
But this is not the case here.	Siin see aga nii ei ole.
I knew it wasn't what he wanted.	Ma teadsin, et see pole see, mida ta tahtis.
Just say nothing.	Lihtsalt ütle mitte midagi.
And that's good.	Ja see on hea.
So he did the whole thing.	Nii et ta tegi kogu asja ära.
Definitely don't believe !.	Kindlasti ei usu!.
All this was to be expected.	Seda kõike oli oodata.
Now you really have it.	Nüüd on sul see tõesti olnud.
Not now, he said.	Mitte praegu, ütles ta.
It went pretty fast.	See läks päris kiiresti.
He had a wife.	Tal oli naine.
He does too.	Ta teeb ka.
He had done it before.	Ta oli seda varem teinud.
But it's better than nothing.	Aga see on parem kui mitte midagi.
And if you don't understand what he's doing, it's your problem.	Ja kui sa ei saa aru, mida ta teeb, on see sinu probleem.
It works well.	See töötab hästi.
But I'm not quite sure how to do it.	Kuid ma pole päris kindel, kuidas seda teha.
Or not.	Või ei tee.
Before anyone knew we were here.	Enne kui keegi teadis, et me siin oleme.
That is the reason.	See on põhjus.
I said come on, man.	Ma ütlesin, et tule, mees.
I said the sooner the better.	Ma ütlesin, et mida varem, seda parem.
For me it certainly did.	Minu jaoks tegi see kindlasti.
I knew him.	Ma teadsin teda.
I was happy to leave.	Mul oli hea meel lahkuda.
You can get them tomorrow.	Saate need homme saada.
That's what he did.	Seda ta tegi.
She's well liked.	Ta on hästi meeldinud.
But not today.	Aga mitte täna.
Say what needs to be said.	Ütle, mida on vaja öelda.
So that was what he felt.	Nii et see oli see, mida ta tundis.
You know me.	Sa tead mind.
I don't get it at all.	Ma ei saa sellest üldse aru.
And even then, he's never so happy.	Ja isegi siis pole ta kunagi nii õnnelik.
He has no business knowing that.	Tal pole asja seda teada.
We haven't heard anything.	Me pole midagi kuulnud.
I'm the reason why.	Mina olen põhjus, miks.
He has to tell me what to do.	Ta peab mulle ütlema, mida teha.
So there's nothing to do.	Nii et midagi pole teha.
I think he saw exactly what he said he saw.	Ma arvan, et ta nägi täpselt seda, mida ta ütles, et nägi.
I'm happy to do my job.	Olen õnnelik, et saan oma tööd teha.
No, he's not.	Ei, tema ka mitte.
He didn't understand.	Ta ei saanud aru.
It was more than he had ever done.	See oli rohkem, kui ta kunagi teinud oli.
That is really difficult to say.	Seda on tõesti raske öelda.
He had so much life.	Tal oli nii palju elu.
You think you want to see it.	Arvad, et tahad seda näha.
It's not like that.	See pole midagi sellist.
He didn't last too long.	Ta ei pidanud liiga kaua vastu.
He is afraid.	Ta kardab.
But my father and mother, he said.	Aga minu isa ja ema, ütles ta.
And if he could do it to you.	Ja kui ta saaks seda sinuga teha.
He just died.	Ta just suri.
That is all.	See on kõik.
She is not happy.	Ta ei ole õnnelik.
He didn't say what it was.	Mis see oli, ta ei öelnud.
I was just happy to be there.	Mul oli lihtsalt hea meel seal olla.
You can always do this last night.	Saate seda alati teha eelmisel õhtul.
That's going well.	See läheb hästi.
We have to go.	Me peame minema.
It's not just for me.	See pole ainult minu jaoks.
Talk.	Rääkima.
I don't want to leave.	Ma ei taha ära minna.
You don't even think he's good.	Sa isegi ei arva, et ta on hea.
I think I knew what to expect.	Ma arvan, et ma teadsin, mida oodata.
That's so good.	See on nii hea.
I hope to see you soon.	Ma loodan sind varsti näha.
Even my mother.	Isegi mu ema.
We have to go home.	Me peame koju minema.
I don't think we've done it.	Ma arvan, et me pole sellega hakkama saanud.
Or with us.	Või meiega.
I've never seen it before.	Ma pole seda kunagi varem näinud.
Everything will be fine.	Kõik läheb hästi.
He said so.	Ta ütles nii.
It wasn't a job.	See ei olnud töö.
You're here all my life.	Sa oled siin kogu elu.
I can't say why right now.	Ma ei oska praegu öelda, miks.
Definitely.	Kindlasti.
But the woman did not see anything she wanted.	Naine aga ei näinud midagi, mida ta tahtis.
I needed it.	Mul oli seda vaja.
He couldn't talk.	Ta ei saanud rääkida.
I didn't think much of it.	Ma ei arvanud sellest palju.
She will soon be too old for anyone to want her.	Ta on varsti liiga vana, et keegi teda tahaks.
Not so much.	Mitte nii palju.
That's the only one.	See on ainus.
But it's not a big deal.	Aga see pole suur asi.
I don't know where to go.	Ma ei tea, kuhu minna.
But he wasn't gone.	Aga ta polnud läinud.
I just wanted to see this place again.	Tahtsin lihtsalt seda kohta uuesti näha.
That's right now.	Nüüd on nii.
Not a bit either.	Ka mitte natuke.
Come down !.	Tule alla!.
It was something that was left behind.	See oli midagi, mis oli maha jäänud.
But it was.	Aga nii oli.
He was sure he had done it.	Ta oli kindel, et oli seda teinud.
Nothing could be done for him.	Tema heaks ei saanud midagi teha.
That, the only one.	See, ainuke.
That was my problem.	See oli minu probleem.
That's probably one of the reasons he's tired.	See on ilmselt üks põhjus, miks ta on väsinud.
I can get back home.	Ma saan end koju tagasi.
But that wouldn't do either.	Aga ka see ei teeks.
His mother died the following year.	Tema ema suri järgmisel aastal.
But he wanted to go home.	Aga ta tahtis koju minna.
Soon someone will.	Varsti teeb keegi seda.
I really need to do this.	Ma pean selle tõesti ära tegema.
So you know.	Selleks, et sa tead.
This can be difficult to do.	Seda võib olla raske teha.
I saw it now.	Ma nägin seda nüüd.
This is not a job.	See ei ole töö.
The problem is that.	Probleem on selles.
But it didn't go away.	Aga ei läinud.
I'm not sure why.	Ma pole kindel, miks see nii teeb.
We had a lot to talk about.	Meil oli palju rääkida.
But not tonight.	Aga mitte täna õhtul.
Someone is talking to me.	Keegi räägib minuga.
Nor did he see him.	Ega ta ei näinud teda.
It was nothing.	See polnud midagi.
He has a hard job.	Tal on raske töö.
And he didn't look happy about it.	Ja ta ei paistnud selle üle õnnelik.
He's never seen anything like it.	Ta pole kunagi midagi sellist näinud.
I'm going myself.	Ma lähen ise.
Maybe we'll have to wait.	Võib-olla tuleb oodata.
And it seems to work.	Ja tundub, et see töötab.
Is that money? 	Kas see on raha?
You know that.	Seda sa tead.
I like living here.	Mulle meeldib siin elada.
There's a lot of it.	Seda on palju.
Same, so and so.	Sama, nii ja nii.
He did it.	Ta tegi seda.
That's good, man.	See on hea, mees.
You just know.	Sa lihtsalt tead.
I really don't know what to say more than that.	Ma tõesti ei tea, mida rohkem öelda kui see.
He's just a man.	Ta on lihtsalt mees.
But it might help.	Aga see võib aidata.
I don't understand what happened.	Ma ei saa aru, mis juhtus.
It was just the only option.	See oli lihtsalt ainus võimalus.
But not really.	Aga tegelikult ei ole.
Not yet and maybe never.	Mitte veel ja võib-olla mitte kunagi.
That was good to know.	Seda oli hea teada.
You are .	Sa oled .
As it should be.	Nagu peab.
He couldn't leave.	Ta ei saanud lahkuda.
He didn't want to play at all.	Ta ei tahtnud üldse mängida.
I'm sure he wants you to be happy.	Olen kindel, et ta tahab, et sa õnnelik oleks.
He probably won't even tell me.	Tõenäoliselt ta isegi ei ütle mulle.
It doesn't.	See ei tee.
It just seemed so hard.	See tundus lihtsalt nii raske.
Maybe he did.	Võib-olla ta tegi seda.
Someone gave it to me.	Keegi andis selle mulle.
It does a good job.	See teeb head tööd.
We are pretty good, but not good enough.	Oleme üsna head, kuid mitte piisavalt head.
They did nothing for us.	Nad ei teinud meie heaks midagi.
Not that he would have held out for his own sake.	Mitte, et ta enda pärast vastu oleks pidanud.
And he'll probably never see him at home again.	Ja tõenäoliselt ei näe ta teda enam kunagi kodus.
He wasn't the only one.	Ta polnud ka ainuke.
Human is all the way.	Inimene on kogu tee.
We get a lot of it.	Me saame seda palju.
He was glad to see him.	Tal oli hea meel teda näha.
That was several years ago.	See oli mitu aastat tagasi.
That's fine.	See läheb korda.
But you never knew.	Aga sa ei teadnud kunagi.
But he probably won't last long.	Tõenäoliselt ei pea ta aga kaua vastu.
Definitely.	Kindlasti.
I did it.	Mina tegin seda.
Besides, it works well.	Peale selle töötab see hästi.
He can do it.	Ta saab seda teha.
All the same to him.	Kõik sama talle.
He really didn't like this man.	See mees talle tõesti ei meeldinud.
It's all very.	See kõik on väga.
This is not currently the case.	Praegu seda ei ole.
Now is.	Nüüd on.
But this is a big mistake.	Aga see on suur viga.
That was to be expected.	Seda oli oodata.
You just have to tell me now.	Sa pead mulle ainult nüüd ütlema.
It's just you and me.	See on ainult sina ja mina.
I can hardly see anything.	Ma ei näe peaaegu midagi.
You don't feel anything.	Sa ei tunne midagi.
Then we can negotiate.	Siis saame asja läbi rääkida.
I didn't see you and.	Ma ei näinud sind ja.
Now he wasn't sure if he wanted it or not.	Nüüd polnud ta kindel, kas ta tahab seda või mitte.
Mine is his.	Minu oma on tema oma.
You can't live long if you don't eat.	Sa ei saa kaua elada, kui sa ei söö.
And he can't know me.	Ja ta ei saa mind teada.
You'll never know.	Sa ei saa kunagi aimugi.
He didn't understand how.	Ta ei saanud aru, kuidas.
When he came back, he looked better.	Kui ta tagasi tuli, tundus ta parem.
There was nothing left of it.	Sellest ei jäänud midagi alles.
If you don't know, say so.	Kui sa ei tea, siis ütle.
I just need to get something in me.	Lihtsalt tuleb midagi minu sisse saada.
But who knows.	Kes aga teab.
He didn't want to eat.	Ta ei tahtnud süüa.
There is still no help.	Abi pole ikka veel.
You've been waiting a long time.	Olete kaua oodanud.
And there are problems with that.	Ja sellega on probleeme.
He felt asleep.	Ta tundis, et ta jäi magama.
But to be there.	Aga seal olla.
You're beautiful too.	Sa oled ka ilus.
I really don't know what to do now.	Ma tõesti ei tea, mida nüüd teha.
You don't have to talk about it right now.	Sa ei pea sellest praegu rääkima.
Down for everything.	Alla kõige eest.
I did and I do.	Tegin ja teen.
Which is really good.	Mis on tegelikult hea.
Which is probably happening now.	Mis ilmselt ka nüüd juhtub.
Well with me.	Minuga hästi.
He told you that.	Ta ütles sulle seda.
If anyone objects.	Kui keegi on vastu.
He wasn't sure if they knew anymore.	Ta polnud kindel, kas nad enam teadsid.
He's a good father.	Ta on hea isa.
He said you knew that.	Ta ütles, et sa tead sellest.
Not too much.	Mitte liiga palju.
I would have done everything.	Ma oleksin kõike teinud.
It didn't work out for him either.	Ka see ei läinud talle korda.
How are you?	Kuidas sa.
I don't know him well enough.	Ma ei tunne teda piisavalt hästi.
He has to go.	Ta peab minema.
I know you too well.	Ma tean sind liiga hästi.
I hope he gets in.	Loodan, et ta saab sisse.
It's almost like him.	See on peaaegu nagu tema.
It's much better.	See on palju parem.
It wasn't itself.	Ise polnud.
Really great.	Tõesti väga.
And then it's the mother person.	Ja siis on see ema inimene.
So much time.	Nii palju aega.
He didn't say anything.	Ta ei öelnud midagi.
It was pretty easy to do.	Seda oli üsna lihtne teha.
We like to eat.	Meile meeldib süüa.
It just happened.	See lihtsalt juhtus.
But it isn't.	Aga ei ole.
I want to know why.	Ma tahan teada, miks.
He never did.	Ta pole kunagi teinud.
That is not the case with me.	Minuga see nii ei ole.
It's not something you have.	See pole midagi, mis teil on.
I know he's just human.	Ma tean, et ta on lihtsalt inimene.
I don't eat much anymore.	Ma ei söö enam palju.
He would be fine alone.	Tal oleks üksi kõik hästi.
Definitely a big problem.	Kindlasti suur probleem.
It's over tomorrow.	Homme on see läbi.
It was something he had never known.	See oli midagi, mida ta polnud kunagi teadnud.
But he's gone.	Aga ta on läinud.
Let it go.	Lase sel minna.
Now he had nothing against it.	Nüüd polnud tal selle vastu midagi.
The thing is, you don't have to be.	Asi on selles, et sa ei pea olema.
Then someone had spoken.	Siis oli keegi rääkinud.
That way he always knew where they were.	Nii teadis ta alati, kus nad on.
You want him to be like you.	Sa tahad, et ta oleks nagu sina.
I think he is happy.	Ma arvan, et ta on õnnelik.
But it's really true.	Aga see on tõesti tõsi.
My mother died this year.	Mu ema suri sel aastal.
Everything would be fine.	Kõik oleks hästi.
And that's my problem.	Ja see on minu probleem.
And if he had stayed home.	Ja kui ta oleks koju jäänud.
You never know when you'll need it.	Kunagi ei tea, millal seda vaja võib minna.
He can't do it again.	Ta ei saa seda uuesti teha.
I never thought you would.	Ma poleks kunagi arvanud, et sa seda teed.
But the man said nothing.	Aga mees ei öelnud midagi.
They don't anymore.	Nad enam ei tee.
why why why why	miks miks miks miks.
He knew he had them.	Ta teadis, et tal need on.
Above all, he didn't want it back.	Üle kõige ei tahtnud ta seda tagasi.
He never had.	Tal pole kunagi olnud.
That's how it went down.	Nii see alla läks.
What? 	Mida?
he says.	ta ütleb.
And it's true.	Ja see on tõsi.
He had seen him.	Ta oli teda näinud.
All three of you.	Te kõik kolm.
He would be.	Ta oleks.
I have a wife now.	Mul on nüüd naine.
He didn't know that.	Ta ei teadnud seda.
The better for us.	Seda parem meile.
And no one ever does.	Ja keegi ei tee seda kunagi.
I also like to make things.	Mulle meeldib ka asju teha.
Maybe that's the problem.	Võib-olla on see probleem.
Like this man.	Nagu see mees.
Time to leave.	Aeg lahkuda.
Money is hard to come by.	Raha on raske saada.
He could leave now if he wanted to.	Ta võiks nüüd lahkuda, kui tahab.
I thought everything was fine.	Arvasin, et kõik on hästi.
That's his business.	See on tema asi.
That's why.	See on põhjus, miks.
Now he couldn't do it.	Nüüd ta ei saanud seda teha.
He works there too.	Ta töötab ka seal.
Everything went well.	Kõik läks hästi.
How it feels.	Kuidas see tundub.
But not only now.	Aga mitte ainult praegu.
I want to do better.	Ma tahan paremini teha.
It was hard for him.	See oli tema jaoks raske.
He got it.	Ta sai selle.
The top looked down.	Üles tundus alla.
That wasn't it.	See polnud see.
I want to be both.	Ma tahan olla mõlemad.
Then he said again what I wanted.	Siis ütles ta uuesti, mida ma tahan.
We are not only our job !.	Me ei ole ainult meie töö!.
You never know what may be needed.	Kunagi ei tea, mida vaja võib minna.
Like what happened.	Nagu see, mis juhtus.
It did what he wanted to do.	See tegi seda, mida ta teha tahtis.
He wants to talk to you.	Ta tahab sinuga rääkida.
That's right.	Just nii see on.
Not after what he just saw.	Mitte pärast seda, mida ta just nägi.
Nobody really knows everything.	Keegi ei tea tegelikult kõike.
They told me when and how to do everything.	Nad ütlesid mulle, millal ja kuidas kõike teha.
We can't say why.	Me ei oska öelda, miks.
We don't think so.	Me ei arva nii.
It's all me.	Kõik olen mina.
There has been nothing.	Midagi pole olnud.
Wait for me outside.	Oota mind väljas.
Maybe so, but not fast enough for me.	Võib-olla nii, aga minu jaoks mitte piisavalt kiiresti.
Especially his.	Eriti tema oma.
And then there are his parents.	Ja siis on tema vanemad.
He didn't say why he came here.	Ta ei öelnud midagi, miks ta siia tuli.
That's not a bad thing.	See pole just halb.
Just to see how he's doing.	Lihtsalt selleks, et näha, kuidas tal läheb.
We can't get through this.	Me ei saa sellest läbi.
I'm so happy for you.	Mul on sinu üle nii hea meel.
This is not a bad thing.	See pole väga halb.
That's really good.	See on tõesti hea.
She is very old and wants to go home.	Ta on väga vana ja tahab koju tagasi.
I think they're still there.	Ma arvan, et nad on alles.
The car came soon.	Üsna pea tuli auto.
So it was very interesting.	Nii et see oli väga huvitav.
Apparently he finally put him to sleep.	Ilmselt andis ta lõpuks magama.
That is the first thing to say.	See on esimene asi, mida öelda.
Say it works.	Ütle, et see töötab.
We don't know how he does it.	Me ei tea, kuidas ta seda teeb.
Here, no one.	Siin, mitte keegi.
So come up.	Nii et tule üles.
That is all.	See on kõik.
Everything could help.	Kõik võiks aidata.
But then he spoke.	Aga siis ta rääkis.
He did what he said.	Ta tegi seda, mida ta ütles.
She looks better this year than last year.	Ta näeb sel aastal parem välja kui eelmisel aastal.
I can't believe it.	Ma ei suuda seda uskuda.
Especially not for him.	Eriti mitte tema jaoks.
I wonder if you've been happy, if you're happy now.	Huvitav, kas sa oled olnud õnnelik, kas sa oled praegu õnnelik.
Only not yet.	Ainult mitte veel.
I'm not talking to him.	Ma ei räägi temaga.
But it is not.	Aga see ei ole.
That doesn't have to be a problem.	See ei pea olema probleem.
He would never do that.	Ta ei teeks kunagi midagi sellist.
It's just a matter of me.	See on lihtsalt minuga asi.
It's more like.	See on rohkem nagu.
I understand you right away.	Ma saan su kohe aru.
It comes and goes.	See tuleb ja läheb.
It just comes out.	See tuleb lihtsalt välja.
Both are not good.	Mõlemad pole head.
She saw.	Ta nägi.
But not when he was busy.	Aga mitte siis, kui ta oli hõivatud.
She couldn't be pretty.	Ta ei saanud olla ilus.
Yes, he said.	On, ütles ta.
But he couldn't get in.	Kuid ta ei saanud sisse.
I wanted to see more.	Tahtsin rohkem näha.
But not in this.	Aga mitte selles.
I really don't want to.	Ma tõesti ei taha.
True, they are.	Tõsi, nad on.
That was never my path.	See ei olnud kunagi minu tee.
And it is.	Ja on.
It could be better.	See võib olla parem.
But he did.	Aga ta tegi.
Be this man.	Ole see mees.
I want to do it.	Ma tahan seda teha.
Maybe nothing.	Võib-olla mitte midagi.
I wasn't sure what, but it was true.	Ma polnud kindel, mis, aga see oli tõsi.
We are very busy.	Oleme väga hõivatud.
He has nothing to say or nothing to say.	Ta ei ütle midagi või tal pole midagi öelda.
That was bad.	See oli halb.
That didn't seem to help.	Tundus, et sellest pole abi.
I didn't want to do it alone.	Ma ei tahtnud seda üksi teha.
You don't need help.	Te ei vaja abi.
That doesn't work out.	See ei tee asja korda.
But it wasn't that easy.	Kuid see ei olnud nii lihtne.
He was back.	Ta oli tagasi.
Not even his parents knew.	Isegi tema vanemad ei teadnud.
I had said early on that this year it was.	Olin juba varakult öelnud, et sel aastal on see see.
He's my friend.	Ta on mu sõber.
What was was no more.	Seda, mis oli, pole enam.

They just can't do it.	Nad lihtsalt ei saa seda teha.
We are alone now.	Oleme nüüd üksi.
But he knew right away.	Aga ta teadis kohe.
But he wouldn't have been happy about it.	Kuid ta poleks selle üle õnnelik olnud.
And he wouldn't be alone anymore.	Ja ta ei oleks enam üksi.
That is not true.	See ei ole tõsi.
I had seen enough.	Ma olin piisavalt näinud.
Probably true too.	Tõenäoliselt ka tõsi.

And what else did they know.	Ja mida nad veel teadsid.
He recognized it.	Ta tundis selle ära.
I think now is the time to tell you that.	Ma arvan, et nüüd on aeg teile seda öelda.

You're with me.	Sa oled minuga.

I told him that too.	Ma ütlesin talle ka seda.
Which is actually a woman.	Mis on tegelikult naine.
It wasn't just me.	See ei olnud ainult mina.
And my wife.	Ja mu naine.

They hadn't talked about it yet.	Nad polnud sellest veel rääkinud.
He was not happy about it.	Ta ei olnud selle üle õnnelik.

He thinks it's a good thing.	Ta arvab, et see on hea asi.
A really long time.	Tõesti kaua aega.

There is a lot to learn here.	Siin on palju teada saada.
No, come on, come on.	Ei, tule, tule.

He's left behind.	Ta jääb maha.
They knew what it could do.	Nad teadsid, mida see teha võib.
Or her.	Või tema.
We have to talk about it.	Peame selle läbi rääkima.
I think he's both.	Ma arvan, et ta on mõlemad.
But what it was, that was it.	Aga mis see oli, see oli see.
I never understood how he could do that.	Ma ei saanud kunagi aru, kuidas ta seda teha sai.
I don't think you're good.	Ma arvan, et sa ei ole hea.
That's not the point.	Asi pole selles.
And that's what he had been.	Ja seda ta oli olnud.
How about ?.	Kuidas oleks?.

I'm so sorry.	Mul on nii väga kahju.
John wasn't there.	Johni polnud seal.

In fact, it is already happening.	Tegelikult see juba toimub.
I don't understand either.	Mina ka ei saa aru.

I fully understand that.	Ma saan sellest täiesti aru.
He's here too.	Ta on ka siin.

We've been waiting for you all day.	Oleme teid terve päeva oodanud.
But that was a mistake.	See oli aga viga.
I was good enough.	Olin piisavalt hea.
They are very.	Need on väga.
We can do more and better.	Saame teha rohkem ja paremini.
But he didn't hear anything either.	Aga ta ei kuulnud ka midagi.
It's not all here or there.	Seda kõike pole ei siin ega seal.
It's going to be beautiful.	See saab ilus olema.
Too long ago.	Liiga kaua aega tagasi.
I'm going to be a father.	Minust saab isa.
So he is everything.	Nii et ta on kõik.
That was a mistake.	See oli viga.
You are all here.	Olete kõik siin.
I know someone who would be surprised by that.	Ma tean kedagi, kes oleks selle üle üllatunud.
My mother made them so good.	Mu ema tegi need nii heaks.
And you want more.	Ja sa tahad ka rohkem.
If you don't, who does ?.	Kui sina ei tee, siis kes teeb?.
It can only be good.	See saab olla ainult hea.
And he had no idea why.	Ja tal polnud aimugi, miks.
If we really have.	Kui meil tõesti on.
It was just something that happened.	See oli lihtsalt midagi, mis juhtus.
You can't be left here alone.	Sa ei saa siia jääda üksi.
I almost did.	Ma peaaegu tegin.
Man and woman.	Mees ja naine.
It's not hard.	See pole raske.
I don't know if it is.	Ei tea, kas see on.
It was just that.	Oli ainult see.
You should go too.	Sa peaksid ka minema.
He has said so.	Ta on nii öelnud.
Everyone has gone home now.	Kõik on nüüd koju läinud.
There it really was.	Seal see tõesti oli.
That was his life.	See oli tema elu.
You want too much.	Tahad liiga palju.

My father was one.	Mu isa oli üks.
I want to do more than just see.	Ma tahan teha rohkem kui lihtsalt näha.
I certainly don't.	Ma kindlasti mitte.
He sees it.	Ta näeb seda.
But there has to be something, so just tell me.	Aga midagi peab olema, nii et lihtsalt ütle mulle.
Surely it was just this man, he told himself.	Kindlasti oli see ainult see mees, ütles ta endale.
It will be a beautiful thing.	Sellest saab ilus asi.
This is something you don't have to do.	See on midagi, mida te ei pea tegema.
There was a good reason.	Oli hea põhjus.
Even better than usual.	Isegi parem kui tavaliselt.
I know so much.	Ma tean nii palju.
You are really beautiful.	Sa oled tõesti ilus.
I got almost nothing.	Ma ei saanud peaaegu midagi.
Just didn't do anything.	Ainult midagi ei teinud.
And he did it.	Ja ta tegi seda.
But that was all.	See oli aga kõik.
I would never do that to us.	Ma ei teeks seda meile kunagi.
Here's an opportunity.	Siin on võimalus.
I don't even remember why.	Ma isegi ei mäleta enam, miks.
One cannot know something that is not so.	Inimene ei saa teada midagi, mis pole nii.
They never went out.	Nad ei läinud kunagi välja.
This is especially good.	See on eriti hea.
I won't do it anymore.	Ma ei tee seda enam.
His only option.	Tema ainus võimalus.
He wanted something he could do himself.	Ta tahtis midagi, mida saaks ise teha.
He needs my help.	Ta vajab minu abi.
She's sure.	Ta on kindel.
But it seems to have happened.	Kuid tundub, et see juhtus.
This is life.	See on elu.
It actually works pretty well.	See töötab tegelikult päris hästi.
He is the only father he has ever known.	Ta on ainus isa, keda ta kunagi teadnud on.
There is definitely a problem with what is happening.	Kindlasti on probleem selles, mis toimub.
He will never know.	Ta ei saa kunagi teada.
And that's exactly the way it is.	Ja tegelikult on see täpselt nii.
The car must be.	Auto peab olema.
And me too.	Ja mina ka.
He had no idea.	Tal polnud aimugi.
But that would be so difficult.	Aga see oleks nii raske.
He didn't like it.	Talle see ei meeldinud.
He would do it again.	Ta teeks seda uuesti.
Everyone was out except him.	Kõik olid väljas peale tema.
And very happy too.	Ja väga õnnelik ka.
This is good and bad.	See on hea ja halb.
You have known something you will never know again.	Oled teadnud midagi, mida sa enam kunagi teada ei saa.
Why should it be easy ?.	Miks see peaks lihtne olema?.
Everything was done pretty quickly.	Kõik oli üsna kiiresti läbi.
Everything would be over tonight.	Täna õhtul oleks kõik läbi.
But it didn't go away.	Aga ei läinud.
So he's still a problem.	Nii et ta on endiselt probleem.
I just didn't think it would happen.	Ma lihtsalt ei arvanud, et see juhtub.
But it was hard.	Aga see oli raske.
I really don't know what to do anymore.	Ma tõesti ei tea enam, mida teha.
It felt too good.	See tundus liiga hea.
My father's friend.	Minu isa sõber.
Tell him why that was supposed to be the case.	Ütle talle, miks see nii pidi olema.
Come with me !.	Tule tee minuga kaasa!.
You couldn't see it.	Sa ei saanud seda näha.

That would really be too much.	Seda oleks tõesti liiga palju.
Please come home with me.	Palun tule minuga koju.
I've never heard of it.	Ma pole sellest kunagi kuulnud.
He had too much left to live for.	Tal oli liiga palju elada jäänud.
But he couldn't say it.	Kuid ta ei saanud seda öelda.
Out there.	Seal väljas .
It happened before.	See juhtus enne.
It's still you.	See oled ikka sina.
I wasn't there long.	Ma ei olnud seal kaua.

What does it look like?.	Kuidas see välja näeb?.
No, wait, don't talk.	Ei, oota, ära räägi.
He wants her.	Ta tahab teda.
First in.	Esimene sisse.
I know mine.	Ma tean, et minu oma.
It can't be too hard.	See ei saa olla liiga raske.
They couldn't even eat.	Nad ei saanud isegi süüa.

Both are with us now.	Mõlemad on praegu meiega.
He looked them over.	Ta vaatas need üle.
He wanted to believe him so much.	Ta tahtis nii väga teda uskuda.
And he's not doing so well.	Ja tal ei lähe nii hästi.
You know, you don't even have to.	Tead, sa ei pea isegi seda tegema.
I'm sure it would.	Olen kindel, et oleks.
Same as before.	Sama mis enne.
And he went out.	Ja ta läks välja.
In fact, it happened quite quickly.	Tegelikult juhtus see üsna kiiresti.

That would be the case now.	See oleks nüüd nii.
It's just our business.	See on ainult meie asi.
Just a friend, that's all.	Lihtsalt sõber, see on kõik.
I think it does what you want.	Ma arvan, et see teeb seda, mida sa tahad.
Not sure what's going on or what to do.	Pole kindel, mis toimub või mida teha.
You don't have to tell me you're tired.	Sa ei pea mulle ütlema, et oled väsinud.
Nothing goes in, nothing goes out.	Midagi ei lähe sisse, midagi ei lähe välja.
It's more the same.	See on rohkem sama.
That's how it is.	Nii see on.
If he didn't say so, they couldn't go in.	Kui ta seda ei öelnud, ei saanud nad sisse minna.
He thought everything would be fine.	Ta arvas, et kõik saab korda.
I have to tell you then.	Pean siis sulle ütlema.
My mother falls asleep.	Mu ema jääb magama.
We don't think we have to.	Me ei usu, et peame seda tegema.
It does something.	See teeb midagi.
Now there's nothing wrong with that.	Nüüd pole sellega viga.
I'm really happy for you.	Mul on tegelikult sinu üle hea meel.
Maybe it is.	Võib-olla see ka on.
No one saw anything like it.	Keegi ei näinud midagi sellist.

Better him than us.	Parem tema kui meie.
He was over.	Ta oli läbi.

It's just you and me.	See on ainult sina ja mina.
I want you too much.	Ma tahan sind liiga palju.
He knows everything you need to know.	Ta teab kõike, mida on vaja teada.
That would have done it.	See oleks seda teinud.
He didn't tell us who we were.	Ta ei rääkinud meile, kes me oleme.
It's that simple !.	See on nii lihtne!.
You know everything about me now.	Sa tead nüüd minust kõike.
There is simply no money.	Raha lihtsalt pole.
I really am.	ma tõesti olen.
He was all set.	Ta oli kõik valmis.
I think you know how to do it.	Ma arvan, et sa tead, kuidas seda teha.
He didn't want to go in at all.	Ta ei tahtnud üldse sisse minna.
He never speaks against me.	Ta ei räägi kunagi minu vastu.
More where it came from.	Veel, kust see tuli.
He said he was going out with me.	Ta ütles, et läheb minuga välja.
You were out of it then.	Sa olid siis sellest väljas.
But maybe he was better now.	Aga võib-olla oli tal nüüd parem.
There shouldn't be anything wrong.	Midagi viga ei pea olema.
I didn't expect it to be this good.	Ma ei oodanud, et see nii hea on.
I'm there.	Ma olen seal.
I just wasn't ready for it, really.	Ma lihtsalt ei olnud selle jaoks valmis, tõesti.
And even if he wanted to.	Ja isegi kui ta tahaks.
Good to know.	Hea teada.
There was something in it.	Midagi oli selles.
It's really nothing.	See pole tõesti midagi.
He was so good to me.	Ta oli minu vastu nii hea.
If you have it all easy.	Kui teil on see kõik lihtne.
And that he will be back soon.	Ja et ta tuleb varsti tagasi.
He undoes things.	Ta teeb asju tagasi.
You are who you are.	Sa oled see, kes sa oled.
I don't get it!.	Ma ei saa sellest aru!.
Now everyone likes it.	Nüüd meeldib see kõigile.
And that's bad.	Ja see on halb.
He told me the same thing a few days ago.	Ta ütles mulle paar päeva tagasi sama palju.
I really beg you.	Ma tõesti palun teid.
First of all.	Kõige peale.
Maybe just as well.	Võib-olla sama hästi.
Three were gone.	Kolm oli läinud.
I had never seen him.	Ma polnud teda kunagi näinud.
He is sure of it.	Ta on selles kindel.
It does that.	See teeb seda.
Do you think it works?.	Kas sa arvad, et see töötab?.

His own wife.	Tema enda naine.
It can be anything or nothing.	See võib olla midagi või mitte midagi.
I have it too.	Mul on ka see.
Everything was as it should be.	Kõik oli nii nagu pidi.
That you want to be.	Et sa tahad olla.
It's just too much anymore.	Seda on lihtsalt enam liiga palju.
But not to say.	Aga pole öelda.
Now it was time to go to bed.	Nüüd oli aeg magama minna.
Boy, not much.	Poiss, pole palju.
Why not? 	Miks mitte?
he says.	ta ütleb.
His father did not want to leave.	Tema isa ei tahtnud lahkuda.
That's it.	Seda see on.
There was work to be done.	Tööd oli teha.
They said that.	Nad ütlesid seda.
And they don't understand now.	Ja nad ei saa praegu aru.
But he still had too much time.	Kuid tal oli endiselt liiga palju aega.
Then he finally realized it.	Siis sai ta sellest lõpuks aru.
It was a pity and all that.	Sellest oli kahju ja kõik see.
I saw it.	Ma nägin seda.
I didn't know he could do it.	Ma ei teadnud, et ta seda suudab.
Father is waiting for me at home.	Isa ootab mind koju.
More than ready.	Rohkem kui valmis.

He wanted to go in.	Ta tahtis sisse minna.
It had to be something.	See pidi midagi olema.
Not this, please not this! 	Mitte seda, palun mitte seda!

Not to say, we.	Et mitte öelda, meie.
And it was all ours.	Ja see kõik oli meie.
I know you have.	Ma tean, et sul on.

It's just hard to say.	Seda on lihtsalt raske öelda.
I wish he wouldn't do that.	Soovin, et ta seda ei teeks.
I know what.	Ma tean mida.
He understood, she told herself.	Ta sai aru, ütles naine endale.
He did well.	Tal läks hästi.

That says nothing.	See ei ütle midagi.

I've never had it.	Mul pole seda kunagi olnud.
And he agreed.	Ja ta oli nõus.
The problem seems too big.	Probleem tundub liiga suur.

He didn't even like the guy.	See mees talle isegi ei meeldinud.
I didn't go that route.	Ma ei läinud seda teed.
But he couldn't leave yet.	Kuid ta ei saanud veel lahkuda.
And you can see why he says that.	Ja on näha, miks ta seda ütleb.
That was interesting.	See oli huvitav.
The man is going out.	Mees läheb välja.
They both knew that was exactly what he was doing.	Nad mõlemad teadsid, et see on täpselt see, mida ta teeb.
We are all busy, but there are many of us.	Oleme kõik hõivatud, kuid meid on palju.
Looks like you're having a problem.	Tundub, et teil on probleem.
I knew he knew it, too.	Ma teadsin, et ta teadis seda ka.
That's how he felt.	Nii ta tundis.
I had him now.	Mul oli ta nüüd.
If you don't want to be yourself.	Kui sa ise ei taha olla.
Maybe for quite some time.	Võib-olla päris kaua.
Tell me where it goes.	Ütle mulle, kuhu see läheb.
I'm surprised you're here.	Ma olen üllatunud, et sa siin oled.
I'm sorry he was even here.	Mul on kahju, et ta üldse siin oli.

I don't know anything more about it.	Ma ei tea sellest rohkem midagi.

That's all, and it's almost nothing.	See on kõik ja see pole peaaegu midagi.
It should be very easy for you.	See peaks olema teie jaoks väga lihtne.

It needs to be talked about.	Sellest tuleb rääkida.
I thought my mother was bad.	Ma arvasin, et mu ema on halb.

He had never done this before.	Ta polnud seda kunagi varem teinud.
But he says nothing more.	Rohkem ta aga midagi ei ütle.
That's good to know.	Seda on hea teada.
He knew about it.	Ta teadis seda kohta.
No one knew who they were.	Keegi ei teadnud, kes nad on.

He had been a good man.	Oli olnud hea mees.

And you do.	Ja sa teed.
No, he doesn't need it, he said.	Ei, ta ei vaja seda, ütles ta.
Today, they are more so than ever.	Praegu on nad seda rohkem kui kunagi varem.

Just not mine.	Lihtsalt mitte minu oma.

It just wasn't like that.	See lihtsalt ei olnud nii.

I can't talk.	Ma ei saa rääkida.

It didn't do any good.	See ei teinud midagi head.
You can't get any more.	Rohkem sa ei saa.
I wanted him to do it.	Ma tahtsin, et ta seda teeks.
Maybe he still was.	Võib-olla ta ikka oli.
He said it was.	Ta ütles, et oli.
But he wasn't like that.	Kuid ta polnud midagi sellist.
You're not even there.	Sind pole isegi seal.
What is it, he said.	Mis see on, ütles ta.
It is not like that.	See ei ole nii.
He doesn't like it.	Talle see ei meeldi.
I didn't know who.	Ma ei teadnud, kes.
If anyone knew he was ready, it was him.	Kui keegi teadis, et ta on valmis, oli see tema.
It's just not exactly what they said.	Ainult et see pole täpselt see, mida nad ütlesid.
They were a couple.	Nad olid paar.
You know that.	Sa tead seda.
But then it wasn't at all, actually.	Aga siis see polnud üldse see, tegelikult.
Dad always said time was money.	Isa ütles alati, et aeg on raha.
But what if.	Aga mis siis, kui.
He knew my father.	Ta tundis mu isa.
It should be so.	See peaks nii olema.
Something is happening there.	Midagi seal juhtub.
He saw why.	Ta nägi, miks.
Now is a good time.	Praegu on hea aeg.

He is as good as he told me.	Ta on nii hea, kui mulle ütles.
You are so Beautiful.	Sa oled nii ilus.
And it will be.	Ja see saab olema.
I don't like him.	Ta ei meeldi mulle.
Bad road.	Halb tee.
That is not true either.	Ka see pole tõsi.
I like being able to do that.	Mulle meeldib, et saan seda teha.
Why not? 	Miks mitte?
I just couldn't get off today.	Ma lihtsalt ei saanud täna maha.
We can't stay here right now.	Me ei saa praegu siia jääda.
But that was not what he felt.	Kuid see polnud see, mida ta tundis.
He seemed worried.	Ta tundus mures.
He had it.	Tal oli see.
That's all there is to come.	See on kõik, rohkem pole oodata.
It's really up to me.	See läheb mulle tõesti peale.
And you know it.	Ja sa tead seda.
He probably doesn't think it's time.	Tõenäoliselt ei arva ta, et oleks selleks aeg.
I'm never good enough.	Ma pole kunagi piisavalt hea.
But when he did.	Aga kui ta seda tegi.
It's all a feeling.	See kõik on tunne.
This is how we are at home.	Nii me kodus oleme.
You sure know your stuff my friend.	Sa tead kindlasti oma asju, mu sõber.
We no longer have our own lives.	Meil ei ole enam oma elu.
That would be difficult.	See oleks raske.
Probably would never do that.	Tõenäoliselt ei teeks seda kunagi.
He was so sorry.	Tal oli nii kahju.
But he couldn't help it.	Kuid ta ei saanud seda aidata.
But it's over now.	Aga see on nüüd läbi.
I don't like them either.	Mulle need ka ei meeldi.
He didn't tell you well at all.	Ta ei rääkinud sinust üldse hästi.
I know everything you want to say.	Ma tean kõike, mida sa öelda tahad.
Nothing like that.	Ei midagi sellist.
Now wait here.	Nüüd oota siin.
If he's true, he's a friend.	Kui ta on tõsi, on ta sõber.
As of now.	Nagu just praegu.
It probably has to be.	See peab ilmselt olema.
He was in it for himself.	Ta oli selles enda jaoks.
You have to do it.	Peab seda tegema.
Not before or after.	Ei varem ega pärast.
I wanted to know if you understood me.	Tahtsin teada, kas saate minust aru.
He had no one.	Tal polnud kedagi.
I have no idea why it's there at all.	Mul pole aimugi, miks see seal üldse on.
And we had a chance to talk about it.	Ja meil oli võimalus sellest rääkida.
Everything seems to be going pretty well.	Tundub, et kõik läheb päris hästi.
We need to talk to you.	Me peame sinuga rääkima.
He really was.	Ta oli tõesti.
We are really worried about that.	Oleme selle pärast tõesti väga mures.
He knows it could be.	Ta teab, et see võib nii olla.
She was not a woman for him.	Ta polnud tema jaoks naine.
We never talk.	Me ei räägi kunagi.
But I don't have time.	Mul pole aga aega.
He is all yours.	Ta on kõik sinu oma.
He looked as surprised as she felt.	Ta nägi välja sama üllatunud kui naine tundis.
It does that.	See teeb seda.
I had never been there.	Ma polnud seal kunagi käinud.
They all said no.	Nad kõik ütlesid ei.
I don't remember anything.	Ma ei mäleta mitte midagi.
It either happens or it doesn't.	See kas juhtub või mitte.
I'm a bad guy.	Ma olen halb mees.
But it never was.	Aga kunagi ei olnud.
I'm off today.	Ma olen täna ära.
He sleeps with me.	Ta läheb minuga magama.
I don't like them.	Mulle nad ei meeldi.
He doesn't own you.	Ta ei oma sind.
But not too much.	Aga mitte liiga palju.
They don't need us.	Nad ei vaja meid.
He said that would likely happen this week.	Ta ütles, et see juhtub tõenäoliselt sel nädalal.
He was done with it now.	Ta oli sellega nüüd läbi.
He died the following year.	Ta suri järgmisel aastal.
No problems yet.	Pole veel probleeme.
But everything went too well to be true.	Kõik läks aga liiga hästi, et tõsi olla.
But he wasn't ready to tell him yet.	Kuid ta polnud veel valmis seda talle rääkima.
But they didn't.	Kuid nad ei teinud seda.
They don't understand, she told herself.	Nad ei saa aru, ütles ta endale.
He told me that my mother would come back.	Ta ütles mulle, et mu ema tuleb tagasi.
He seemed like a solid guy.	Ta tundus olevat kindel mees.

This is what is happening now.	See on see, mis praegu toimub.
And that's not all.	Ja see pole veel kõik.
And we must have it.	Ja see peab meil olema.
This is a big problem.	See on suur probleem.
If they are, you're good to go.	Kui need on, siis olete valmis.
He just can't do this to me.	Ta lihtsalt ei saa seda minuga teha.
You still can.	Ikka võib.
Good to have you here.	Hea, et sa siin oled.
He didn't see anyone.	Ta ei näinud kedagi.
He looked bad.	Ta nägi halb välja.
He's the only one who can tell.	Ta on ainuke, kes oskab öelda.
How can you.	Kuidas saate.
I don't think he'll ever do that.	Ma ei usu, et ta seda kunagi teeb.
Then come to me.	Tule siis minu juurde.
It was more than it seemed.	See oli rohkem, kui näis.
Very good, very happy.	Väga hea, väga õnnelik.
Never again for me.	Mitte kunagi enam minu jaoks.
He wasn't particularly surprised.	Ta ei olnud eriti üllatunud.
He had wanted it for so long.	Ta oli seda nii kaua tahtnud.
But it's not quite that simple.	Kuid see pole päris nii lihtne.
I can get through it pretty quickly.	Ma saan selle üsna kiiresti läbi.
A couple of things.	Paar asja.

I think and hope so.	Ma arvan ja loodan nii.
Too bad.	Liiga halb.
You've had a hard time.	Sul on olnud raske aeg.
He did it to me.	Ta tegi seda minuga.
That was life.	See oli elu.
We can only go so fast.	Me saame ainult nii kiiresti minna.
I think it's just too much work.	Minu arvates on see lihtsalt liiga palju tööd.
You have to do it yourself.	Seda tuleb ise teha.
Don't come back.	Mitte tagasi tulla.
All of these are known.	Kõik need on teada.

Then I have a lot of time and we can talk.	Siis on mul palju aega ja saame rääkida.

Not yet, he told himself.	Veel mitte, ütles ta endale.
I think we should go our separate ways.	Ma arvan, et me peaksime minema oma teed.
It works well enough.	See töötab piisavalt hästi.
Like he knew it would happen.	Nagu ta teadis, et see juhtub.
Come do it with us.	Tule tee seda koos meiega.
And wait some more.	Ja oota veel.
He never told me how he knew.	Ta ei öelnud mulle kunagi, kust ta teadis.
He didn't have time.	Tal polnud aega.
Everything was fine now.	Nüüd oli kõik hästi.
But that's just not the case.	Kuid see pole lihtsalt nii.
It's never long.	Kunagi pole kaua aega.
The man did so.	Mees tegi nii.
We weren't ready for that at all.	Me ei olnud selleks üldse valmis.
Never tell him more than he tells you.	Ära kunagi ütle talle rohkem, kui ta sulle ütleb.

Here it was.	Siin see oli.
I'm sure it will be.	Olen kindel, et see saab olema.
I think he should have done it.	Minu arvates oleks ta pidanud seda tegema.

I think it might be better that way.	Ma arvan, et see võib olla parem nii.
I would have done the same.	Mina oleksin sama teinud.

He lives here.	Ta elab siin.
I can handle him.	Ma saan temaga hakkama.
It didn't help now.	Nüüd polnud sellest abi.
But much more is needed.	Kuid vaja on palju rohkem.
And it doesn't look that good anymore.	Ja see ei näe enam nii hea välja.
I'm sorry .	Mul on kahju .
He never heard anything.	Ta ei kuulnud kunagi midagi.
He never got out.	Ta ei saanud kunagi välja.

I won't let him see it.	Ma ei lase tal seda näha.
He still didn't believe it.	Ta ei uskunud seda ikka veel.
I think you have a thing.	Ma arvan, et sul on asi.
I have a job and a wife.	Mul on töö ja naine.
I told you why not.	Ma ütlesin sulle, miks mitte.
It's easy.	Ta on lihtne.
I didn't have a chance to find out.	Mul ei olnud võimalust seda teada saada.
Although it was true.	Kuigi see oli tõsi.
My father was worried about me too.	Mu isa oli ka minu pärast mures.
Are you.	Kas sa .
Maybe he can tell you what to do for him.	Võib-olla oskab ta sulle öelda, mida tema heaks teha.
He wanted to know what was coming.	Ta tahtis teada, mis tuleb.
Not our real mother.	Mitte meie päris ema.
He's better than that.	Ta on sellest parem.
He already knows me.	Ta tunneb mind juba.
But it was certain that he was there.	Kindel oli aga, et ta oli seal.
Now they never do.	Nüüd ei tee nad seda kunagi.
At his home.	Tema kodus.
He had heard of it.	Ta oli sellest kuulnud.
He wanted his mother back.	Ta tahtis oma ema tagasi.
That's what they really should do.	Seda nad tõesti tegema peaksid.
The only one actually.	Ainuke tegelikult.
My mother just died.	Ema just suri.
It's so good to see you.	Nii hea on sind näha.
Probably does.	Ilmselt teeb.
In fact, you can do more than that.	Tegelikult saate teha rohkem kui see.
But after that, no idea.	Aga pärast seda pole aimugi.
But he didn't understand where.	Aga ta ei saanud aru, kus.
He was worried.	Ta oli mures.
Now it's time to go to bed.	Nüüd on aeg magama minna.
Not really, no.	Mitte päris, ei.
You do everything yourself.	Sa teed kõike ise.
He has to go.	Ta peab minema.
I had no idea what it could be.	Mul polnud aimugi, mis see olla võiks.
I don't think they did.	Minu arvates pole nad seda teinud.
It wasn't that he didn't want to do it.	Asi polnud selles, et ta ei tahtnud seda teha.
And that was the whole thing.	Ja see oli kogu asi.
It wasn't too pretty.	See ei olnud liiga ilus.
But that's exactly what you want.	Kuid see on täpselt see, mida sa tahad.
He had a bad feeling about it.	Tal oli sellest halb tunne.
At home, my husband sees it all.	Kodus näeb seda kõike mu mees.
I know that very well.	Ma tean seda väga hästi.
It never was, really.	See pole kunagi olnud, tõesti.
Please.	Palun.
You never know when you might need it.	Kunagi ei tea, millal seda vaja võib minna.
Or did not believe everything.	Või ei uskunud kõike.
I don't think you ever will.	Ma arvan, et sa ei tee seda kunagi.
He doesn't want you.	Ta ei taha sind.
Maybe he didn't have it.	Võib-olla tal polnud seda.
It might be good for you.	Sulle võib see hea olla.
We don't see why not.	Me ei näe, miks mitte.
He couldn't be sure.	Ta ei saanud kindel olla.
And he wasn't the only one.	Ja ta polnud ainuke.
But this week it really happened.	Kuid sel nädalal see tõesti juhtus.
Not that he needed to.	Mitte, et tal oleks vaja.
Here he is at last.	Siin ta lõpuks on.
I don't think it would be very pretty.	Ma ei usu, et see oleks väga ilus.
Not more.	Mitte rohkem.
I hope he can come soon.	Loodan, et ta saab kiiresti tulla.
That's what he does.	Seda ta teeb.
I am so glad to see you.	Mul on nii hea meel teid näha.
He supposed he had to be.	Ta arvas, et ta pidi olema.
It won't be hard.	See ei saa olema raske.
No, come away.	Ei, tule ära.
He was still there.	Ta oli ikka veel seal.
It's no help.	Sellest pole abi.
I should have done it earlier.	Ma oleksin pidanud seda varem tegema.
He was alone and no one knew where he was.	Ta oli üksi ja keegi ei teadnud, kus ta on.
The thing that occurred to me.	See asi, mis mulle peale tuli.
I had a life here.	Mul oli siin elu.
I'm doing better.	Mul läheb paremini.
He came right away.	Ta tuli kohe.
You have no way to leave.	Sul pole võimalust lahkuda.
I can't say yet.	Ma ei oska veel öelda.
I wanted to be with him.	Tahtsin temaga koos olla.
Too much for me.	Minu jaoks liiga palju.
How to switch.	Kuidas üle minna.
But he wasn't the only one.	Kuid ta polnud ainuke.
We are not the problem.	Meie ei ole probleem.
It's tomorrow.	See on homme.
Maybe he realized it gave too much.	Võib-olla sai ta aru, et see andis liiga palju ära.
It's not that easy.	See pole nii lihtne.
What made me.	Mis pani mind.
I didn't see you.	Ma ei näinud sind.
He wasn't sure yet.	Ta polnud veel kindel.
It is much better to eat it.	Seda on palju parem süüa.
We didn't do that.	Meie seda ei teinud.
Then he alone.	Siis ta üksi.
He may know something.	Ta võib midagi teada.
But maybe it's good.	Aga võib-olla on see hea.
I was sure of that.	Olin selles kindel.
No one could have survived it.	Keegi poleks suutnud seda üle elada.
I don't like to do anything.	Mulle ei meeldi mitte midagi teha.
I didn't like it.	See ei meeldinud mulle.
He wanted to.	Ta tahtis.
Even then.	Isegi siis.
It's not you.	See pole sina.
Tell us what to do.	Räägi meile, mida tuleb teha.
I won't let him go.	Ma ei lase tal minna.
I think you should go to him.	Ma arvan, et sa peaksid tema juurde minema.
But they don't really have to.	Aga nad ei pea seda tegelikult tegema.
Not just a man.	Mitte ainult mees.
You shouldn't even be here.	Sa ei peaks isegi siin olema.
I think that's good.	Ma arvan, et see on hea.
And you just told me you weren't going in.	Ja sa just ütlesid mulle, et sa ei lähe sisse.
I was really happy.	Ma olin tõesti õnnelik.
We are tired.	Me oleme väsinud.
He asked him to come home immediately.	Ta palus tal kohe koju tulla.
Really worried about that.	Tõesti mures selle pärast.
He was who he used to be.	Ta oli see, kes ta varem oli.
But he wouldn't.	Aga ta ei teeks.
I only have one life to live.	Mul on ainult üks elu elada.
Only he couldn't leave.	Ainult ta ei saanud lahkuda.
And it probably is.	Ja ilmselt on.
Do what you want, when you want.	Tee mida tahad, millal tahad.
That's it then.	See on siis nii.
Maybe you weren't.	Võib-olla sa ei olnud.
And she looked down on him.	Ja ta vaatas talle alla.
Can't figure out how to do it.	Ei saa aru, kuidas seda teha.
He said it had become my thing.	Ta ütles, et sellest on saanud minu asi.
We must tell him.	Me peame talle kindlasti ütlema.
And when he died, my mother got it.	Ja kui ta suri, sai mu ema selle.
Nobody can stand it.	Keegi ei pea vastu.
The woman came back.	Naine tuli tagasi.
I am going.	Ma lähen.
In fact, he hadn't done anything.	Tegelikult polnud ta midagi teinud.
I think that's good.	Ma arvan, et see on hea.
I didn't know how to come back.	Ma ei teadnud, kuidas tagasi tulla.
The most.	Kõige rohkem.
To see.	Et näha .
I know what to say.	Ma tean, mida öelda.
When it's over.	Kui see on läbi.
No, there's no time for that.	Ei, selleks pole aega.
This is all we have.	See on kõik, mis meil on.
But it's not that easy.	Kuid see pole nii lihtne.
To play along.	Et kaasa mängida.
They won't let him go.	Nad ei lase tal minna.
Comes down quickly.	Tuleb kiiresti alla.
As you like.	Nagu sulle meeldib.
A friend was with me.	Sõber oli minuga.
They told me they told him.	Nad ütlesid mulle, et nad ütlesid talle.
He would be late.	Ta oleks hiljaks jäänud.
I would be interested to know if you agree.	Oleksin huvitatud sellest, kas olete nõus.
But it wasn't like that.	Kuid see ei olnud nii.
I'm easy to get along with.	Minuga on lihtne läbi saada.
It wasn't meant to be either.	Ka see ei pidanud olema.
This happens quite often.	Seda juhtub üsna sageli.
Good roads.	Head teed.
I had never done this before.	Ma polnud seda kunagi varem teinud.
He felt it.	Ta tundis seda.
But you understand.	Aga saate aru.
And my father.	Ja mu isa.
I doubt it is.	Ma kahtlen, et see nii on.
We don't need to talk about it.	Me ei pea sellest rääkima.
I wanted to be alone.	Tahtsin üksi olla.
So here's your chance.	Nii et siin on teie võimalus.
It's just so much better.	See on lihtsalt nii palju parem.
Now tell everyone about it.	Räägi nüüd sellest kõigile.
And this is the reason why.	Ja see on põhjus, miks.
Nobody wanted to know anything.	Keegi ei tahtnud midagi teada.
Excuse me.	Kuidas palun.
They are nobody.	Nad on mitte keegi.
I did a pretty good job.	Ma tegin päris head tööd.
Maybe that was the case here.	Võib-olla oli see siin nii.
There's his friend.	Seal on tema sõber.
He actually said so.	Ta ütles tegelikult nii.
We're all a little tired.	Oleme kõik veidi väsinud.
We are as ready as we can be.	Oleme nii valmis, kui saame.
.	.
He looked at her for a long time.	Ta vaatas teda kaua.
That everyone knew it was over.	Et kõik teadsid, et see on läbi.
They told me that.	Nad ütlesid mulle seda.
Or no one at all.	Või üldse mitte kedagi.
Dad wanted to talk.	Isa tahtis rääkida.
He put it down.	Ta pani selle maha.
This should be it.	See peaks olema see.
.	.
He didn't know why, why then.	Ta ei teadnud, miks, miks siis.
He didn't see anyone.	Ta ei näinud kedagi.
But that's what you are.	Aga see on see, mis sa oled.
It was easy to believe.	Seda oli lihtne uskuda.
He didn't have to.	Ta ei pidanud.
I had no idea it was you.	Mul polnud aimugi, et see oled sina.
But for us it was really, really bad.	Aga meie jaoks oli see tõesti väga halb.
He didn't like that.	See talle ei meeldinud.
Just for you.	Just teile.
I've had it with him.	Mul on see temaga koos olnud.
That doesn't seem to be the case.	Tundub, et see pole nii.
I have to go.	Ma pean minema.
Ours is really good.	Meie oma on tõesti hea.
She knew she looked beautiful.	Ta teadis, et näeb ilus välja.
He knows that, too.	Ta teab seda ka.
Now he wants to talk.	Nüüd tahab ta rääkida.
Not quite, but almost.	Mitte päris, aga peaaegu.
And that's it.	Ja see on see.
I thought that was a good thing.	Ma arvasin, et see on hea asi.
That you knew.	Et sa teadsid.
The fire looked pretty good.	Tuli nägi päris hea välja.
It was pretty easy for me.	Minu jaoks oli see üsna lihtne.

You're not very tired at all.	Sa pole üldse väga väsinud.
Works well.	Töötab hästi.
I've heard of it.	Olen sellest kuulnud.
However, this is not always the case.	See ei ole aga alati nii.
I don't really like it.	Mulle endale see eriti ei meeldi.
To stay or not to stay.	Kas jääda või mitte jääda.
Has to be.	Peab olema.

The man said so.	Mees ütles nii.

Just like your father.	Täpselt nagu su isa.
We didn't, man.	Me ei teinud seda, mees.
With that he left.	Sellega ta lahkus.
And good for him.	Ja hea talle.
It's a bit more than that.	See on natuke rohkem kui see.
But wait, wait.	Aga oota, oota.
Although I still have mine.	Kuigi mul on oma veel alles.
All, alone.	Kõik, üksi.
We can't do that.	Me ei saa seda teha.
That's a really good thing.	See on tõesti hea asi.
I've always wanted you.	Ma olen sind alati tahtnud.

He looked ready to get off.	Ta näis olevat valmis maha minema.
He thought he could negotiate.	Ta arvas, et saab läbi rääkida.
Just don't, that's all.	Lihtsalt ära tee, see on kõik.
He never thought it would be like this.	Ta polnud kunagi arvanud, et see nii läheb.
Like .	Nagu .
Other than that, you'll be fine.	Peale selle läheb sul kõik hästi.

He must have thought better.	Ta arvas vist paremini.

He didn't tell anyone.	Ta ei öelnud kellelegi.
He was so sure.	Ta oli nii kindel.
And very beautiful.	Ja väga ilus.
You shouldn't do that.	Sa ei peaks seda tegema.
But now he knew they wouldn't do it, not right away.	Aga nüüd ta teadis, et nad seda ei tee, mitte kohe.

Maybe it wouldn't have been.	Võib-olla poleks olnud.
You're interested in me.	Sa oled minust huvitatud.

I certainly did.	Kindlasti tegin.
And it's not always easy.	Ja see pole alati lihtne.
But he still has his.	Aga tal on ikka oma.

But he was still not well.	Kuid ta polnud ikka veel terve.
I wanted to play more.	Tahtsin rohkem mängida.
That was what he was ready to do today.	See oli see, mida ta oli täna valmis tegema.
I wonder if he understands that.	Huvitav, kas ta saab sellest aru.

He didn't want to talk to me.	Ta ei tahtnud minuga rääkida.

He was old enough to know better.	Ta oli piisavalt vana, et paremini teada saada.

And then it's gone.	Ja siis on see läinud.
That's how he looked at him.	See, kuidas ta teda vaatas.
He knew they weren't.	Ta teadis, et nad ei olnud.

Feeling bad.	Halb end.

I want to believe he can help her.	Ma tahan uskuda, et ta saab teda aidata.

Why are you still here?	Miks sa veel siin oled?
We've talked about it.	Oleme sellest rääkinud.
I certainly can't talk.	Ma ei saa kindlasti rääkida.
We weren't in it for ourselves.	Me ei olnud selles enda jaoks.
It was a lot like that.	See oli palju sellist.
Definitely a long wait.	Kindlasti tuleb kaua oodata.

Really like you.	Tõesti nagu sina.
I have no problem with that.	Mul pole sellega probleeme.
That was another mistake of mine.	See oli veel üks minu viga.

But he wasn't sure about that.	Kuid ta ei olnud selles kindel.
I hope she's happy.	Ma loodan, et ta on õnnelik.
That would be too good to be true.	See oleks liiga hea, et tõsi olla.

This is a great help.	Sellest on suur abi.
I wanted him to be mine.	Ma tahtsin, et ta oleks minu oma.
It just happened, that's all.	See lihtsalt juhtus, see on kõik.
It gave a little.	See andis natuke.
That was all he had to say for himself.	See oli kõik, mis tal enda eest öelda oli.
Maybe he thinks he can live with it.	Võib-olla arvab ta, et suudab sellega elada.
And even if not all.	Ja isegi kui mitte kõik.
It should have been me.	See oleks pidanud olema mina.
He couldn't.	Ta ei saanud.
I thought it would be better not to come back.	Arvasin, et parem oleks mitte enam tagasi tulla.
I was before.	Ma olin enne.
And he left.	Ja ta lahkus.
That told me something.	See ütles mulle midagi.
Just like a man.	Täpselt nagu mees.
We have, we have.	Meil on, meil on.
You can't do that.	Sa ei saa seda teha.
But nothing like that.	Aga ei midagi sellist.
That is a good thing and a bad thing.	See on hea ja halb asi.
I didn't really want anything.	Ma ei tahtnud tegelikult midagi.
And we can't have a job.	Ja meil ei saa olla tööd.
I wonder if anyone lives in it now.	Huvitav, kas selles praegu keegi elab.

But not when he was busy.	Aga mitte siis, kui ta oli hõivatud.
I didn't understand it at all.	Ma ei saanud sellest üldse aru.
But a woman.	Aga naine.
I know it was good.	Ma tean, et see oli hea.
That was a big deal.	See oli suur asi.
I'm just.	Ma olen lihtsalt .
And just when you think it's over.	Ja just siis, kui arvad, et see on läbi.
This was usually true.	Tavaliselt oli see tõsi.
He's just who he seems to be.	Ta lihtsalt on see, kes ta näib olevat.
I don't see the road.	Ma ei näe teed.
Hang on!.	Pea vastu!.
But he didn't have a chance to say that.	Kuid tal ei olnud võimalust seda öelda.
I doubt it will ever be.	Ma kahtlen, kas see kunagi saab.
He did what he had to do.	Ta tegi seda, mida ta tegema tuli.
But that's not why we're here.	Kuid see pole põhjus, miks me siin oleme.
It was then, it is now.	See oli siis, see nüüd.
She was a man, she was a woman.	Tema oli mees, tema oli naine.
But that's not what you think.	Kuid see pole see, mida sa arvad.
But it didn't.	Kuid see ei teinud seda.
Maybe he still would.	Võib-olla ta ikka teeks.
This way you will know what to do.	Nii saate teada, mida teha.
But if so, so be it.	Aga kui nii olla, siis nii olla.
If he had, he would have told her.	Kui ta oleks seda teinud, oleks ta seda talle öelnud.

I didn't get it.	Ma ei saanud seda.
It will be canceled.	See jääb ära.
He never wanted to get it.	Ta polnud seda kunagi tahtnud saada.
And for me too.	Ja minu jaoks ka.
I don't know anything other than that.	Ma ei tea midagi peale selle.
They were probably worried about me.	Tõenäoliselt olid nad minu pärast mures.
It's really interesting to do.	Seda on tõesti päris huvitav teha.
Pretty good actually.	Päris hea tegelikult.
He won't need it anymore.	Varsti ei vaja ta seda enam.
There is only one good reason for this.	Selleks on ainult üks hea põhjus.
I need someone here.	Mul on siia kedagi vaja.
They were very good to me.	Nad olid mulle väga head.
It's not as easy as it sounds.	See pole nii lihtne, kui tundub.
It couldn't be good.	See ei saanud hea olla.
I wasn't with him.	Ma ei olnud temaga.
So you understand.	Nii et saate aru.
He's more than they told me.	Ta on rohkem, kui nad mulle ütlesid.
It's just good.	See on lihtsalt hea.
Here's your problem.	Siin on teie probleem.
But that didn't seem to be the case.	Kuid see ei paistnud nii olevat.
They can't handle it.	Nad ei saa hakkama.
When it comes back, it comes fast.	Kui see tagasi tuleb, tuleb see kiiresti.
He was looking at his things.	Ta vaatas oma asju.
We don't understand why this happens.	Me ei saa aru, miks see nii juhtub.
But that's all.	Aga see on ka kõik.
At that time it was.	Sel ajal oli.

But it came.	Aga tuli.

His work is not good.	Tema töö pole hea.

You don't have to talk about me.	Sa ei pea minust rääkima.
Work, work.	Töö, töö.
Will definitely be back.	Kindlasti tuleb tagasi.
You were there.	Sa olid seal.
I don't have to say more.	Ma ei pea rohkem ütlema.
But last year alone.	Aga eelmisel aastal üksi.

I have to do it better.	Ma pean seda paremini tegema.
I hope you understand this.	Loodan, et saate sellest aru.
He just didn't know.	Ta lihtsalt ei teadnud.
There would have been nothing.	Poleks midagi olnud.
That's just good.	See on lihtsalt hea.
Are you like.	Kas sa oled nagu .

If you weren't, there would be a problem.	Kui te seda poleks, oleks probleem.
It's bad here now.	Siin on nüüd halb.
Maybe that was the problem.	Võib-olla oli see probleem.
Too fast, too fast.	Liiga kiiresti, liiga kiiresti.
John, it was me.	John, see olin mina.
That was all he said.	See oli kõik, mida ta ütles.
But it doesn't seem to be anymore.	Kuid tundub, et seda enam pole.
His mother died the following year.	Tema ema suri järgmisel aastal.
Never never did.	Kunagi pole kunagi teinud.
To help me.	Et mind aidata.
But a woman.	Aga naine.
They didn't seem too worried.	Nad ei paistnud olevat liiga mures.
He is not good.	Ta ei ole hea.
Too bad.	Liiga halb.
He seemed so happy.	Ta tundus nii õnnelik.
You have to be.	Sa pead nii olema.
Where did it come from.	Kust see tuli.
He's not coming back.	Ta ei tule tagasi.
He didn't see anyone there.	Ta ei näinud seal kedagi.
It seems to me that this is the only option.	Mulle tundub, et see on ainus võimalus.
Too bad about me.	Kahju aga minust.
No one here knows how to do it.	Keegi siin ei tea, kuidas seda teha.
But he hasn't.	Aga ta pole seda teinud.
I have work in the morning.	Mul on hommikul töö.
He knew he needed help.	Ta teadis, et ta vajab abi.
But it looks good.	Aga see näeb hea välja.
He was the man he was.	Ta oli see mees, kes ta oli.
Worried about her more than him.	Tema pärast rohkem mures kui tema pärast.
He didn't want to see it again.	Ta ei tahtnud seda uuesti näha.
Something like that might actually be true.	Midagi sellist võib tõesti tõsi olla.
My life was mine.	Minu elu oli minu oma.
No need.	Pole vaja.
They shouldn't do that.	Nad ei peaks seda tegema.
My only problem is.	Minu ainus probleem on.
Like you.	Nagu sina.
That's all you do.	See on kõik, mida sa teed.
It was a little hard, but good.	Natuke raske oli, aga hea.
I understand.	Ma saan aru.
And don't let anyone but me.	Ja ära lase kedagi peale minu.
I think that must be true.	Ma arvan, et see peab tõsi olema.
One thing we can do.	Üks asi, mida me saame teha.
I also don't know what to do.	ma ei tea ka mida teha.
And one knew it, felt it.	Ja üks teadis seda, tundis seda.
Make it look good.	Tee see hea välja.
So in the end it was my mother.	Nii et lõpuks oli mu ema.
I haven't done that.	Ma pole nii teinud.
He couldn't seem to get out of it.	Näis, et ta ei saanud sellest välja.
Just not him.	Lihtsalt mitte tema.
No one can help anyone.	Keegi ei saa kedagi aidata.
Everything is for yourself.	Kõik on enda jaoks.
He didn't know why.	Ta ei teadnud, miks.
This is not a mistake.	See ei ole viga.
So, that was all.	Nii, see oli kõik.
He just wanted his way.	Ta tahtis ainult oma teed.
Maybe you don't need it right away.	Võib-olla pole sul seda kohe vaja.
So you have to wait for it.	Nii et teil on seda oodata.
The work is over.	Töö on läbi.
That was a mistake.	See oli viga.
He was everything to me.	Ta oli minu jaoks kõik.
I'm sure we won't.	Olen kindel, et me ei tee seda.
I'm not sure what it is.	Ma pole kindel, mis see on.
I'm sorry about you.	Mul on kahju sinust.
You have been missed.	Sinust on ilma jäänud.
There is nothing too much.	Seal pole midagi liiga palju.
And finally.	Ja lõpuks.
And no one can believe that this is true.	Ja keegi ei suuda uskuda, et see on tõsi.
There's just nothing there.	Seal pole lihtsalt midagi.
He really didn't like it.	Talle see tõesti ei meeldinud.
They didn't know it.	Nad ei teadnud sellest.
That's really the reason.	See on tõesti põhjus.
You were the problem.	Sina olid probleem.
But he just couldn't do it.	Kuid ta lihtsalt ei suutnud seda teha.
It wasn't easy.	See ei olnud lihtne.
He knew he could never go back.	Ta teadis, et ei saa kunagi tagasi minna.
This has happened a few times now.	Seda juhtus nüüd paar korda.
He's almost done then.	Ta on siis peaaegu läbi.
That's definitely the only thing there is to like.	See on kindlasti ainus asi, mis seal meeldib.
Don't say that.	Ära räägi nii.
That's good enough.	See on piisavalt hea.
You're too hard.	Sa oled liiga raske.
.	.
And apparently he didn't hear anything.	Ja ilmselt ei kuulnud ta midagi.
So he stayed with me.	Nii et ta jäi minuga.
You can't just say that.	Seda ei saa lihtsalt öelda.
This may help you.	See võib teid aidata.
To find out where he went and why.	Et teada saada, kuhu ta läks ja miks.
I still don't understand.	Ma ei saa ikka aru.
It was a lot of things.	See oli palju asju.
I agree that this is better.	Olen nõus, et nii on parem.
You with me.	Sina minuga.
But right now, it doesn't do that.	Kuid praegu see midagi sellist ei tee.
Maybe not his father.	Võib-olla mitte tema isa.
As you said.	Nagu sa ütlesid.
He didn't seem to hear him.	Näis, et ta ei kuulnud teda.
In my end, everything is ready.	Minu lõpuks on kõik valmis.
But he hadn't been.	Ta ei olnud aga olnud.
Maybe it was too much.	Võib-olla oli seda liiga palju.
Probably his teacher.	Ilmselt tema õpetaja.
It seems like yesterday to me.	Mulle tundub nagu eile.
I highly doubt it.	Ma kahtlen selles väga.
It is very big and too big for me.	See on minu jaoks väga suur ja liiga suur.
This is a mistake and also a bad one.	See on viga ja ka halb.
You're not ready.	Sa pole valmis.
I just don't know how to do it.	Ma lihtsalt ei tea, kuidas seda teha.
It can be big.	See võib olla suur.
We haven't finished.	Me ei ole lõpetanud.
We have to talk.	Peame rääkima.

Now he said he likes it.	Nüüd ütles ta, et talle meeldib see.
And he always would.	Ja ta oleks alati.
But now it wasn't like that.	Aga nüüd see nii ei olnud.
There is no way for me.	Minu jaoks pole tee.
I'm sure my parents would agree with me.	Olen kindel, et mu vanemad on minuga nõus.
That's great.	See on suur.
It always is.	See on alati nii.
That was all.	See oli kõik.
Probably a man.	Ilmselt mees.
He now understood more how it could be.	Ta sai nüüd rohkem aru, kuidas see võiks olla.
It's been a long time.	Kaua aega olnud.
There's still yours.	Seal on sinu ikka.
He doesn't need trouble.	Ta ei vaja probleeme.
And there is another reason.	Ja on veel üks põhjus.
He was really quite tired.	Ta oli tõesti üsna väsinud.
It needs money.	See vajab raha.
But he was happy to be home.	Aga tal oli hea meel kodus olla.
He knows everything.	Ta saab kõike teada.
Not quite three.	Mitte päris kolm.
He doesn't do that anymore.	Ta ei tee seda enam.
Unless he's talking to me.	Kui ta just minuga ei räägi.
Finally, they couldn't take it anymore.	Lõpuks ei pidanud nad enam vastu.
She would oppose him.	Ta oleks talle vastu.
The same thing is happening.	Sama asi toimub.
We have that too.	Meil on ka see.
It hadn't been there before.	Seda polnud seal varem olnud.
But he knew it was true.	Kuid ta teadis, et see oli tõsi.
Everything you ever do agrees.	Kõik, mida sa kunagi teed, on nõus.
But it's just me.	Aga see olen ainult mina.
She must be tired.	Ta peab olema väsinud.
But this has not always been the case.	Kuid see pole alati nii olnud.
It seems that you are not.	Tundub, et sa ei ole.
I want to see you.	Ma tahan sind näha.
I think it probably should be.	Ma arvan, et see peaks ilmselt olema.
He didn't want help.	Ta ei tahtnud abi.
That would be today.	See oleks just täna.
Finally he spoke.	Lõpuks ta rääkis.
True, not much to see.	Tõsi, pole palju näha.
It's a lot like life.	See on palju nagu elu.
He was here this morning.	Ta oli siin just täna hommikul.
I think they should.	Ma arvan, et nad peaksid.
I'm glad you're beautiful.	Mul on hea meel, et sa oled ilus.
He wasn't quite sure.	Ta polnud päris kindel.
They are all over it.	Nad on kõik sellest üle.
He should go.	Ta peaks minema.
You know when you need it.	Tead, kui sul seda vaja on.
I thought you were.	Ma arvasin, et sa oled.
But they are not.	Need pole aga need.
I'm the one who gave it in.	Mina olen see, kes selle sisse andis.
Looks good.	Tundub hea.
And he looked down at me.	Ja ta vaatas mulle alla.
So maybe they're not that good.	Nii et võib-olla pole nad nii head.
We can't do it alone.	Me ei saa seda üksi teha.
Maybe there are too many of you.	Võib-olla on teid paar liiga palju.
His father is tired.	Tema isa on väsinud.
He did, you know.	Ta tegi seda, tead.
Our mother asked.	Meie ema küsis.
It seems to be going well.	Tundub, et läheb hästi.
He said he would.	Ta ütles, et teeb.
We have to go now.	Peame nüüd minema.
Here's your chance to get some.	Siin on võimalus natuke saada.
I hope it's better now.	Loodan, et nüüd on parem.
I know you have time to leave.	Ma tean, et sul on aeg lahkuda.
It can be.	See võib olla.
Then no one knew where to go.	Siis ei teadnud keegi, kuhu minna.
She's still your mother.	Ta on ikka su ema.
It went well.	See läks hästi.
You don't want to miss it.	Sa ei taha sellest ilma jääda.
i don't need your money	ma ei vaja su raha.
I do not want to do this.	Ma ei taha seda teha.
That's still good, though.	See on ikka hea, aga.
But all was well.	Aga kõik oli hästi.
Even if you're a woman.	Isegi kui sa oled naine.
It's just one person.	See on ainult üks inimene.
Not sure what that looks like yet.	Pole veel kindel, kuidas see välja näeb.
It didn't do anything.	See ei teinud midagi.
Afraid of everything.	Kardab kõike.
And he hadn't been home.	Ja ta polnud kodus olnud.
He wasn't the only one.	Ta polnud ainuke.
She said she was waiting for him.	Ta ütles, et ootab teda.
I'm the one who did it.	Mina olen see, kes seda tegi.
But then he didn't know.	Aga siis ta ei teadnud.
In fact, he was sure he would.	Tegelikult oli ta kindel, et ta seda teeb.
These are good for us.	Need on meile head.
All the way down.	Kogu tee alla.
He seemed to need him there.	Tundus, et ta vajab teda seal.
Nobody knows everything.	Keegi ei tea kõike.
And there is a lot of it.	Ja seda on palju.
I can't, can't, can't.	Ma ei saa, ei saa, ei saa.
It was as if they had never been there before.	Tundus, et nad polnud seal varem käinud.
Hang in there and we'll get over it.	Oota ja me saame sellest üle.
Not quite well, as it turned out.	Mitte päris hästi, nagu juhtus.
But you can't see it.	Seda pole aga näha.
Almost certainly not as many people as you want.	Peaaegu kindlasti mitte nii palju inimesi, kui soovite.
Don't tell anyone.	Ära ütle kellelegi.
He had to be told.	Talle tuli öelda.
We will manage.	Me saame hakkama.
That is our only option.	See on meie ainus võimalus.
We've been there.	Oleme seal käinud.
I did it often.	Ma tegin seda sageli.
Especially in the morning.	Eriti hommikul.
But you especially.	Aga sina eriti.
I'm as happy as can be.	Olen nii õnnelik kui olla saab.
It has been very bad.	See on olnud väga halb.
He had found out the night before.	Ta oli sellest teada saanud eelmisel õhtul.
But not him.	Aga mitte tema.
It hasn't been like that.	Nii see pole olnud.
I just have to say that.	Ma lihtsalt pean seda ütlema.
But not right away.	Aga mitte kohe.
Last year he certainly did.	Eelmisel aastal ta seda kindlasti tegi.
But it almost happened.	Kuid see juhtus peaaegu.
There are things you don't know about me.	On asju, mida te minust ei tea.
No, no one can see it.	Ei, keegi ei näe seda.
But he said nothing about it.	Kuid ta ei rääkinud sellest midagi.
And it certainly was.	Ja kindlasti oli.
I wouldn't make the same mistake again.	Ma ei teeks sama viga uuesti.
It should be.	See peaks olema.
He recognized me immediately.	Ta tundis mu kohe ära.
Not even anything.	Isegi mitte midagi.
And it happened so fast.	Ja see juhtus nii kiiresti.
He felt the same way about him.	Ta tundis tema vastu sama.
And it's really hard.	Ja see on tõesti raske.
And like he said, it will be.	Ja nagu ta ütles, nii see saab olema.
My father was just my father.	Mu isa oli lihtsalt minu isa.
He knew he could handle it.	Ta teadis, et ta saab sellega hakkama.
And it was, and he was.	Ja see oli, ja ta oli.
You seem to know a lot about this.	Näib, et tead sellest palju.
Looks like he did.	Näib, et ta tegi.
Where it was now, they didn't know.	Kus see praegu oli, seda nad ei teadnud.
You don't have to do everything yourself.	Sa ei pea kõike ise tegema.
No one at all.	Üldse mitte keegi.
Much, much more.	Palju, palju rohkem.
That's exactly it.	See on täpselt see.
I wanted to know.	Ma tahtsin teada.
She wasn't sure how he felt about her.	Ta polnud kindel, mida mees tema vastu tundis.
And in the end, she wanted him to have it.	Ja lõpuks tahtis ta, et see tal oleks.
I've seen it work, for a very long time.	Olen näinud, et see töötab, väga kaua.
That was my way.	See oli minu tee.
You are not.	Sa ei ole.
You need to talk to me.	Sa pead minuga rääkima.
Or we don't.	Või me ei tee seda.
Finally he spoke.	Lõpuks ta rääkis.
And you don't have to.	Ja te ei pea seda tegema.
But he didn't want to do that.	Seda ta aga teha ei tahtnud.
That's pretty much all we can say.	See on peaaegu kõik, mida me öelda saame.
There was nothing he could do about it now.	Nüüd ei saanud ta sellega midagi teha.
There is no one here at all.	Siin pole üldse kedagi.
What he did.	Mida ta tegi.
He should have been sleeping.	Ta oleks pidanud magama.
There is never too much of a good thing.	Head asja pole kunagi liiga palju.
And so it was the next morning.	Ja nii oli ka järgmisel hommikul.
The thing is, he knows me.	Asi on selles, et ta tunneb mind.
He never had time.	Tal polnud kunagi aega.
That was then.	See oli siis.
The error starts.	Viga hakkab peale.
But no one talked much.	Aga keegi ei rääkinud palju.
No, no it is not.	Ei, ei ole.
But that was all he did.	See oli aga kõik, mida ta tegi.
Like his.	Nagu ka tema oma.
It was only here, now.	See oli ainult siin, praegu.
Maybe they never would have said anything.	Võib-olla poleks nad kunagi midagi öelnud.
He could do it.	Ta saaks hakkama.
But much more needs to be done.	Kuid teha tuleb palju rohkem.
They all knew and didn't tell me.	Nad kõik teadsid ja ei öelnud mulle.
It's ready.	See on valmis.
He knew everything about me.	Ta teadis minust kõike.
But it doesn't.	Kuid see ei tee seda.
It will be over soon.	See läheb varsti üle.
Maybe that was the only feeling he had left.	Võib-olla oli see ainus tunne, mis talle jäi.
It might as well go.	Asi võib sama hästi minna.
But it didn't really work.	Aga tegelikult ei läinud.
He has another one.	Tal on veel üks.
We don't need it now.	Meil pole seda praegu vaja.
He never understood that.	Ta polnud sellest kunagi aru saanud.
No one would be hurt.	Keegi ei saaks viga.
he needs it.	ta vajab seda.
Can't remember what.	Ei mäleta mida.
But you're the only one at home.	Aga sa oled ainuke kodus.
If you need to say something, say so.	Kui sul on vaja midagi öelda, siis ütle.
I definitely can.	Kindlasti saan.

He's had a hard time.	Tal on raske olnud.
If only he had believed it.	Kui ta oleks seda uskunud.
We get along well.	Me saame hästi läbi.
They said they were very interested.	Nad ütlesid, et on väga huvitatud.
That was probably good.	See oli ilmselt hea.
I don't believe this thing.	Ma ei usu seda asja.
It won't be pretty.	See ei saa ilus olema.
He told me about it.	Ta rääkis mulle sellest.
There it was.	Seal oli see.
That was good.	See oli hea.
It will be alright.	See läheb korda.
And quite hard too.	Ja päris raske ka.
I never had a father.	Mul pole kunagi olnud isa.
It's not something you do.	See pole midagi, mida sa teed.
You are so good.	Sul on nii hea.
I was a bit worried too.	Ma olin ka natuke mures.
But it wasn't like a human.	Aga see ei olnud nagu inimene.
Turned it in too.	Andis selle ka sisse.
If something happens, it happens.	Kui midagi juhtub, siis see juhtub.
A friend has said.	Sõber on öelnud.
I just want to help him.	Ma tahan teda lihtsalt aidata.
But he was our man, he had to be.	Aga ta oli meie mees, ta pidi olema.
He has done a lot for me.	Ta on minu heaks palju teinud.
His mother knew where he was.	Tema ema teadis, kus ta on.
He's not coming back.	Ta ei tule tagasi.

There was what to expect.	Oli, mida oodata.

I'm very bad at this.	Ma olen selles väga halb.
He did very well there.	Tal läks seal väga hästi.
The one who did what needed to be done.	See, kes tegi, mis vaja.
Time passed too quickly.	Aeg läks liiga kiiresti.

She is so old.	Ta on nii vana.
He didn't understand what they were.	Ta ei saanud aru, mis need on.

Which was this morning.	Mis oli täna hommikul.

When he was gone.	Kui ta oli läinud.

He hadn't even heard her come in.	Ta polnud isegi kuulnud, et ta sisse tuli.

But real work doesn't come right away.	Aga päris tööd ei tule kohe.
But that wasn't it.	Aga see ei olnud see.
Just didn't do anything.	Lihtsalt ei teinud midagi.
But just to see.	Aga lihtsalt selleks, et näha.
But he had to go in.	Aga ta pidi sisse minema.
I don't want to say that.	Ma ei taha seda välja rääkida.
That's more than we had.	Seda on rohkem kui meil oli.

I wish it wasn't.	Ma soovin, et seda ei oleks.
It couldn't be true.	See ei saanud olla tõsi.
Nothing, nothing.	Mitte midagi, mitte midagi.
But that was probably all he wanted.	Kuid see oli ilmselt kõik, mida ta saada tahtis.
And here's another one.	Ja siin on veel üks.
And he's ready.	Ja ta on valmis.
I just don't understand how.	Ma lihtsalt ei saa aru, kuidas.

Maybe he wanted to.	Võib-olla ta tahtis.

Before he died.	Enne kui ta suri.

He was really something.	Ta oli tõesti midagi.
He gave it away.	Ta andis selle ära.
And we are often worried.	Ja sageli oleme mures.
But they were all good.	Aga nad olid kõik head.
Come too.	Tule ka sina.
It is not necessary.	Seda pole vaja.
No one believes that anymore.	Keegi ei usu seda enam.
He did this often.	Ta tegi seda sageli.
Then it was really over.	Siis oli see tõesti läbi.
Maybe it happened to me.	Võib-olla juhtus see minuga.
Maybe or not.	Võib olla või mitte.
No one in, no one out.	Mitte kedagi sisse, mitte kedagi välja.
He was all set.	Ta oli kõik valmis.
That may be exactly the case.	See võib olla täpselt nii.
Butter, or, or.	Või, või, või.

You and I can talk.	Sina ja mina saame rääkida.
He didn't want to wait to find out more.	Ta ei tahtnud oodata, et rohkem teada saada.
But there wasn't much they could do.	Kuid nad ei saanud palju teha.

He can even help you.	Ta võib sind isegi aidata.
But this one is especially beautiful.	Aga see üks on eriti ilus.
They don't talk.	Nad ei räägi.
They just told me they were.	Nad lihtsalt ütlesid mulle, et nad on.
Now tell me.	Nüüd siis ütle mulle.
The way he already gave everything he did himself.	See, kuidas ta juba andis kõik, mida ta ise tegi.
And he doesn't get it.	Ja ta ei saa sellest aru.
He must be for her.	Ta peab olema tema jaoks.
All good enough.	Kõik piisavalt hea.
He bought it.	Ta ostis selle.
She will probably never see him again.	Tõenäoliselt ei näe ta teda enam kunagi.
We all have to go.	Me kõik peame minema.
It's always been that way.	See on alati nii olnud.
I don't know if to talk or not.	Ma ei tea, kas rääkida või mitte.
I definitely agree.	Olen kindlasti nõus.
But he didn't seem to.	Kuid ta näis olevat mitte.
And the first.	Ja esimene.
I didn't like it.	Mulle ei meeldinud.
And then it was.	Ja siis see oli.
Although you may be sorry about that.	Kuigi sul võib sellest kahju olla.
He's not going either.	Ka tema ei lähe.
He is there waiting for you.	Ta on seal ja ootab sind.
Here and now.	Siin ja praegu.
I'm worried about my mother.	Ma olen oma ema pärast mures.
Me too.	Mulle ka.
He had so much money.	Tal oli nii palju raha.
It's nothing like that.	See pole midagi sellist.
If he could do that, he could do anything.	Kui ta saaks seda teha, saab ta kõike teha.
He can help you get what you want.	Ta võib aidata teil saada seda, mida soovite.
But then he came home.	Siis aga tuli ta koju.
.	.
I really like it.	Mulle tõesti meeldib see.
He spoke quickly.	Ta rääkis kiiresti.
You never really know what to expect.	Kunagi ei tea tegelikult, mida oodata.
But he also knew the woman needed it.	Kuid ta teadis ka, et naine vajab seda.
I just know it is.	Ma lihtsalt tean, et see on.
I don't understand why.	Ma ei saa aru, miks.
But that would be a mistake.	Aga see oleks viga.
You can do it or not.	Saate seda teha või mitte.
But there were always too many of me.	Aga mind oli alati liiga palju.
They have done well.	Nad on hästi hakkama saanud.
So that's something.	Nii et see on midagi.
But if you don't have a lot of money and could wait.	Aga kui sul pole palju raha ja võiks oodata.
He just had to be himself.	Ta pidi ainult olema tema ise.
He asked you, boy.	Ta palus sind, poiss.
If it wants to.	Kui see tahab.
I'll be happy when it's all over.	Ma olen õnnelik, kui see kõik läbi saab.
I never knew that.	Ma ei teadnud seda kunagi.
And that was something he had always known.	Ja see oli midagi, mida ta oli alati teadnud.

This one does the same.	See üks teeb sama.
I'll be back soon.	Olen varsti tagasi.

I just know you are.	Ma lihtsalt tean, et sa oled.
I don't want to talk to you.	Ma ei taha sinuga rääkida.
And he likes it.	Ja see meeldib talle.

He never went out.	Ta ei läinud kunagi välja.
Then your mother told him about you.	Siis rääkis su ema talle sinust.

You must be fine.	Sul on vist hästi läinud.
It didn't.	Seda ei teinud.

It wasn't.	See ei olnud.
This is no longer my life.	See pole enam minu elu.
He certainly didn't.	Ta kindlasti mitte.

Then it went away.	Siis läks see minema.
I wanted so much.	Ma tahtsin nii palju.

I can't get over it.	Ma ei saa sellest üle.
And that was true enough.	Ja see oli piisavalt tõsi.
He felt it.	Ta tundis seda.

Through my head.	Läbi mu pea.

And he may very well get it.	Ja ta võib selle ka väga hästi saada.

I thought we might need it.	Arvasin, et meil võib seda vaja minna.

But he's coming.	Aga ta tuleb.
He says that's not the point.	Ta ütleb, et see pole asi.

I was always worried about everything.	Ma olin alati kõige pärast mures.
That's how it will always be.	Nii saab see alati olema.
He is worried.	Ta on mures.

That's really all.	See on tõesti kõik.
Looks like I can't do it.	Tundub, et ma ei saa seda teha.

It's not coming here.	See ei tule siia.
There was nothing in it.	Selles polnud midagi.

My father, too.	Minu isa ka.

Where, he wasn't sure.	Kuhu, ta polnud kindel.
I never believed that.	Ma ei uskunud seda kunagi.
It's good that we're here.	See, et me siin oleme, on hea.
He is here with me.	Ta on siin minuga.
Maybe there's nothing anyone can do.	Võib-olla ei saa keegi midagi teha.
What is he in the end? 	Mis ta lõpuks on?
They would never do that.	Nad ei teeks seda kunagi.
I was so tired.	Ma olin nii väsinud.
But they didn't stay that way.	Aga nii nad ei jäänud.
He's totally into it.	Ta on sellest täiesti sisse saanud.
And that's what we have to do.	Ja seda me peame tegema.
I hope everything goes well.	Loodan, et kõik läheb hästi.
I was always good.	Mul oli alati hea.
He had plenty of time.	Tal oli palju aega.
But it seems to me that this was a mistake.	Kuid mulle tundub, et see oli viga.
I hope he gets the job.	Loodan, et ta saab selle töö.
Not for the sake of it.	Mitte asja pärast.
How can I do this.	Kuidas ma saan seda teha.
You don't think so.	Sa ei arva nii.
They are always with us.	Nad on alati meiega.
That's what he wanted.	Seda ta tahtis.
And he has told me everything.	Ja ta on mulle kõik rääkinud.
It could have been done easily and immediately.	Seda oleks saanud teha lihtsalt ja kohe.
Pretty good.	Päris hästi läks.
If he couldn't get me, no one could.	Kui tema ei saanud mind, ei saaks keegi.
She wasn't pretty now.	Ta ei olnud nüüd ilus.
It can't come soon enough.	See ei saa tulla piisavalt kiiresti.
I'm not telling anyone anything.	Ma ei ütle kellelegi midagi.
You don't do that.	Sa ei tee seda.
Then we didn't know.	Siis me ei teadnud.
For me, it is.	Minu jaoks see on.
I'm not sure what to do next.	Ma pole kindel, mida pärast seda teha.
But in the end, they were here.	Kuid lõpuks olid nad siin.
We liked this house.	Meile on see maja meeldinud.

They didn't talk about it either.	Nad ei rääkinud ka sellest.
I just don't know why.	Ma lihtsalt ei tea, miks.
But my friend did.	Aga tegi mu sõber.
I never knew who.	Ma ei teadnud kunagi, kes.

I might go.	Ma võib-olla lähen.

I'm afraid it was me.	Ma kardan, et see olin mina.
I wanted it over.	Ma tahtsin, et see oleks läbi.
He died before that happened.	Ta suri enne, kui see juhtus.

This is your friend here.	See on sinu sõber siin.
Knew where they were.	Teadis, kus nad on.
Then he realized he wasn't the only one.	Siis sai ta aru, et ta polnud ainuke.
I hope it is.	Loodan, et on.
Apparently the same could not be said for his father.	Ilmselt ei saanud sama öelda tema isa kohta.
No one was hurt.	Keegi pole viga saanud.
And then it happened.	Ja siis see juhtus.

It is now.	See on nüüd.
It happens all the time.	Seda juhtub kogu aeg.

He doesn't know what to expect.	Ta ei tea, mida oodata.
Not below that.	Mitte alla selle.
I agree with that.	Olen sellega nõus.

He doesn't want to know.	Ta ei taha teada saada.
.	.
I didn't want to do that much.	Ma nii väga ei tahtnud seda teha.
We can't do enough.	Me ei saa piisavalt teha.
But for you too.	Aga sulle ka.

He asked if he could talk to me.	Ta küsis, kas ta saab minuga rääkida.

I have a few more left.	Mul on veel paar üle jäänud.

My dad went all out.	Mu isa läks kõik välja.
I'm always the same me.	Ma olen kogu aeg sama mina.
We have no money.	Meil pole raha.

I can usually talk and talk about it.	Tavaliselt saan sellest rääkida ja rääkida.

It is so beautiful.	See on nii ilus.
I should never talk to you again.	Ma ei peaks kunagi enam sinuga rääkima.

I think he wanted to talk to me.	Ma arvan, et ta tahtis minuga rääkida.
I think it's the only way.	Ma arvan, et see on ainus tee.
Just a bit.	Ainult natuke.

That's so good.	See on nii hea.
But he was glad.	Aga tal oli hea meel.
He tells me he's sorry.	Ta ütleb mulle, et tal on kahju.
Nothing looked good with it.	Midagi ei paistnud sellega hästi.

Not the same at all.	Üldse mitte sama.
I have so much to talk about.	Mul on nii palju rääkida.
There was too much to do.	Teha oli liiga palju.
And you? 	Ja sina?
.	.
I know about you.	Ma tean sinust.
He felt it too.	Ka tema tundis seda.
He's gone, just gone.	Ta on läinud, just läinud.
I already have my first husband.	Mul on juba esimene mees.
He has many of his own.	Tal on palju oma.
He didn't even see me.	Ta isegi ei näinud mind.

I didn't say anything.	Ma ei öelnud midagi.
I know you are sure.	Ma tean, et sa oled kindel.
Tomorrow at the earliest.	Kõige varem homme.
Where he wanted.	Kuhu ta tahtis.
Mary told him all about it.	Mary rääkis talle sellest kõik.
He seems to have done quite well.	Tundub, et tal on päris hästi läinud.
We have to do it.	Peame seda tegema.
I also think it's good.	Ma arvan ka, et see on hea.
He looked like the woman he once knew.	Ta nägi välja nagu naine, keda ta kunagi tundis.
We don't have anything like that here.	Siin pole meil midagi sellist.
It's not what you don't have at all.	See pole üldse see, mis teil pole.
Before that actually.	Enne seda tegelikult.
If not now.	Kui mitte praegu.
And boy, did it ever come through.	Ja poiss, kas see kunagi läbi tuli.

They don't understand why.	Nad ei saa aru, miks.
I never thought she was so beautiful.	Ma poleks arvanud, et ta nii ilus on.
We don't think that's true.	Me ei usu, et see tõsi on.

But we have a chance to find out.	Kuid meil on võimalus teada saada.
But he spoke.	Aga ta rääkis.
He's not going back.	Ta ei lähe tagasi.

This always seems to be the case.	Tundub, et see on alati nii.
How big he is.	Kui suur ta on.
We haven't been able to do that here.	Siin me seda teha pole suutnud.
There was no one here.	Siin polnud kedagi.
He knew they didn't believe him.	Ta teadis, et nad ei uskunud teda.
Nobody buys.	Keegi ei osta.
But he had to be sure.	Kuid ta pidi selles kindel olema.
It comes out well.	See tuleb hästi välja.
It actually works against you.	See töötab tegelikult teie vastu.
And he felt he was not alone.	Ja ta tundis, et ta polnud üksi.

He must have known that.	Ta vist teadis seda.
It is true that it was not difficult for us.	See on tõsi, et meil polnud raske.
This is bad.	See on halb.
I do the same for myself.	Ma teen sama ka enda jaoks.
We don't have that here.	Seda meil siin ei ole.
It can only be one thing, but it's something.	See võib olla ainult üks asi, kuid see on midagi.
Maybe he never knew that.	Võib-olla ei teadnud ta seda kunagi.
Maybe go tomorrow.	Võib-olla läheb homme.
He recognized it immediately.	Ta tundis selle kohe ära.
He didn't have to.	Ta ei pidanud seda tegema.

If ever.	Kui üldse.

It seemed like a thing to do.	Tundus, et asi, mida teha.
But both never left.	Kuid mõlemad ei läinud kunagi ära.
I wasn't alone either.	Ma ei olnud ka üksi.
Eat butter or.	Söö ära või.
He had said the same about himself.	Ta oli sama öelnud enda kohta.
We're not going along with that.	Me ei lähe sellega kaasa.

You need it.	Sul läheb seda vaja.
I'm sorry, really, really.	Mul on kahju, tõesti, tõesti.
If it seems we don't understand.	Kui tundub, et me ei saa aru.

There is another problem.	On veel üks probleem.
Will probably come again to get more.	Tõenäoliselt tuleb uuesti, et rohkem saada.
It is who and what we are.	See on kes ja mis me oleme.
But that's not quite the case.	Kuid see pole päris nii.
He is my person.	Ta on minu inimene.
I'm so afraid of him.	Nii kardan teda.
I'm not good anymore.	Ma ei ole enam hea.
So that didn't go too well.	Nii et see ei läinud liiga hästi.
He's waiting for me.	Ta ootab mind.
I don't think it's good.	Ma arvan, et see pole hea.
There was no mistake.	Viga ei olnud.
Then it does exactly the same thing.	Siis teeb see täpselt sama asja.
He seems like a good boy.	Ta tundub hea poiss olevat.
They had understood.	Nad olid aru saanud.
Everything is alright.	Kõik on hästi.
And big.	Ja suur.
But it's okay if you didn't get it.	Aga pole midagi, kui sa sellest aru ei saanud.
Everyone knew who they were.	Kõik teadsid, kes nad on.
He certainly didn't.	Ta kindlasti mitte.
In .	Aastal .
He had already seen.	Ta oli juba näinud.
No one talks about it.	Keegi ei räägi sellest.
This life is no longer life.	See elu pole enam elu.
What is he afraid of me.	Mida ta minust kardab.
Then, as now.	Siis, nagu praegu.
It's an old thing.	See on vana asi.
Alone is still alone.	Üksi on ikka üksi.
He had only one wife.	Tal oli ainult üks naine.
No, you know that.	Ei, sa tead seda.
There was only one thing to do.	Teha oli ainult üks asi.
He went away.	Ta läks minema.

He said he had to go.	Ta ütles, et peab minema.
I don't even remember it.	Ma isegi ei mäleta seda.

He didn't like it there.	Talle ei meeldinud seal.
It would be just like that.	See oleks täpselt nagu see.
But there was a chance.	Kuid võimalus oli.
Life was pretty good.	Elu oli päris hea.
I don't even want to say that.	Ma isegi ei taha seda öelda.
I'm a woman.	Olen naine.

I was out there.	Ma olin seal väljas.
And that you were ready.	Ja et sa olid valmis.
We're not coming here.	Me ei tule siia.
I'm surprised by that.	Ma olen selle üle üllatunud.
He put me back there.	Ta pani mind sinna tagasi.
Life is hard enough as it is.	Elu on piisavalt raske, nagu ta on.
So everything is going as it should.	Nii et kõik läheb nii, nagu peab.
As fast as you can.	Nii kiiresti kui suudab.
That was all.	See oli kõik.
Everything would be fine if it should be fine.	Kõik oleks hästi siis, kui peaks hästi olema.
He looked more than tired.	Ta nägi välja rohkem kui väsinud.
Finally, he needed it to be over.	Lõpuks oli tal vaja, et see oleks läbi.
I know you don't really want to do this.	Ma tean, et sa ei taha seda tegelikult teha.
He knows how lucky he is.	Ta teab, kui õnnelik tal on.
He does what she doesn't want him to do.	Ta teeb seda, mida naine ei taha, et ta teeks.

But it's not sure where the problem comes from.	Kuid pole kindel, kust probleem tuleb.
Not at all next week.	Järgmisel nädalal üldse mitte.

Maybe it's that simple.	Võib-olla on see nii lihtne.

That he certainly doesn't.	Et ta kindlasti mitte.
I didn't see anyone with him.	Ma ei näinud temaga kedagi.
But there is something else.	Kuid on veel midagi.
Your time is up now.	Sinu aeg on nüüd läbi.
Everything went just fine.	Kõik läks just hästi.
And it is.	Ja on.
I don't like waiting.	Mulle ei meeldi oodata.
Here is one option.	Siin on üks võimalus.
You can't.	Sa ei saa.
I think we have to do it now.	Ma arvan, et me peame seda nüüd tegema.
And in this.	Ja selles.
That's how it is with me.	Minuga on nii.
Maybe he will now.	Võib-olla teeb ta nüüd.
Then we have a lot.	Siis on meil palju.
It's work.	See on töö.
Not alone.	Ega seda üksi.
Same old, same old.	Sama vana, sama vana.
Now don't talk anymore.	Nüüd ei räägi enam.
He is here to help.	Ta on siin, et aidata.
Nobody talks to him.	Keegi ei räägi temaga.
It's actually quite simple.	See on tegelikult üsna lihtne.
I don't know about that.	Ma ei tea sellest.
He knew her.	Ta tundis teda.
We have no problem with that.	Meil pole sellega probleeme.
.	.
He wasn't sure he could do it.	Ta polnud kindel, kas ta suudab seda teha.
Certainly not you.	Kindlasti sa ei teeks.
You probably understand where he's coming from.	Ilmselt saate aru, kust ta tuleb.
This time is for you.	See aeg on sinu enda jaoks.
I'm sure he will.	Olen kindel, et ta teeb seda.
And they had been good.	Ja need olid head olnud.
There! 	Seal!
there! 	seal!
He didn't do that.	Ta ei teinud seda.
But you know about it.	Aga sa tead sellest.
You didn't know that.	Sa ei teadnud seda.
He doesn't see that he can't win anything yet.	Ta ei näe, et ta ei saaks veel midagi võita.
But you know him.	Aga sa tead tema.
I was one with it.	Olin sellega üks.
He gets that too.	Ta saab ka selle.
I hope they don't.	Loodan, et nad seda ei teeks.
Nobody can do that.	Keegi ei saa seda teha.
But that's all he said.	Aga see on kõik, mida ta ütles.
Finally, someone says what they feel.	Lõpuks ütleb keegi, mida tunneb.

You'll be home tomorrow.	Homme saab koju.
Not good at all.	Üldse pole hea.

It looks good on you.	See näeb sind hästi.
And there is enough time.	Ja aega on piisavalt.
Now he feels problems at home.	Nüüd tunneb ta kodus probleeme.
Was he too, man.	Kas tema oli ka, mees.
He recognized it immediately.	Ta tundis selle kohe ära.

You must be seen.	Sind tuleb näha.
They don't want to leave.	Nad ei taha lahkuda.
He doesn't know when, but he knows it will happen.	Ta ei tea, millal, aga ta teab, et see juhtub.
Or out of it.	Või sellest välja.
If you don't like it, sorry.	Kui ei meeldi, siis kahju.
Then go home and sleep.	Siis koju ja magama.
And maybe he finally understood.	Ja võib-olla sai ta lõpuks aru.
To leave here and now.	Et lahkuda siin ja praegu.
That's all there is to it.	Sellest see kõik on.
I think it was just one.	Ma arvan, et see oli ainult üks.
He is like a father to us.	Ta on meile nagu isa.
I'd like to see him more.	Tahaks teda rohkem näha.
All for everyone.	Kõik kõigile.
But he looked like he wanted to say more.	Kuid ta nägi välja, nagu tahaks ta rohkem öelda.

He seems like a good guy.	Ta näib olevat hea mees.
I told him no.	Ma ütlesin talle, et mitte.
I can't believe he would do it again.	Ma ei suuda uskuda, et ta teeks seda uuesti.
But if you can't, and you can't come.	Aga kui sa ei saa, ja sa ei saa tulla.
But he was still a big boy.	Aga ta oli ikka suur poiss.
It just couldn't be true.	See lihtsalt ei saanud tõsi olla.
But we still don't know how it works.	Kuid me ei tea endiselt, kuidas see töötab.
And he didn't want that either.	Ja ta ei tahtnud seda ka.
Immediately he came.	Kohe ta tuli.
He would be the first.	Ta oleks esimene.
I'm so tired of being so big.	Ma olen nii väsinud sellest, et olen nii suur.
He tells her off.	Ta ütleb talle ära.
When he said it was, it was.	Kui ta ütles, et see on nii, siis see oli nii.
That's how you know.	Nii tead.
Everything works over it.	Kõik töötab selle üle.

I just don't know how.	Ma lihtsalt ei tea, kuidas.
So they weren't surprised.	Nii et nad ei olnud üllatunud.
He just died.	Ta just suri.
I've never had to do that before.	Ma pole kunagi varem pidanud seda tegema.
This man and what he knew.	See mees ja see, mida ta teadis.
You knew where to go to get something to eat.	Sa teadsid, kuhu minna, et midagi süüa saada.
He could do it today if he wanted to.	Ta saaks seda täna teha, kui tahaks.
They had not seen or heard anything yet.	Nad ei näinud ega kuulnud veel midagi.
No one knows where it came from.	Keegi ei tea, kust see tuli.
I never say.	Ma ei ütle kunagi.
Everything will be ready, but we are worried.	Kõik saab valmis, kuid me oleme mures.
I don't know where the problem could be.	Ma ei tea, kus probleem võib olla.
You should, you're his friend.	Sa peaksid, sa oled tema sõber.

I agree with him.	Olen temaga nõus.
But they don't.	Aga nad ei tee seda.
I should tell him.	Ma peaksin talle ütlema.
I saw him.	Ma nägin teda.
Not what he just said.	Mitte see, mida ta just ütles.
He couldn't do enough.	Ta ei suutnud piisavalt teha.
He even said that.	Ta on seda isegi öelnud.
Why can't he be mine.	Miks ta ei võiks olla minu oma.
He thought only one looked like him.	Ta arvas, et ainult üks näeb välja nagu tema.
They immediately said no.	Nad ütlesid kohe ei.
Do what you like, but not what you like.	Tee seda, mis sulle meeldib, aga mitte seda.
Then he sees it.	Siis ta näeb seda.
Not nearly as beautiful.	Mitte peaaegu nii ilus.
He was an old friend of my father's.	Ta oli mu isa vana sõber.
It could be someone who is big or not.	See võib olla keegi, kes on suur või mitte.

He didn't want to talk much.	Ta ei tahtnud palju rääkida.
He doesn't get everything he needs.	Ta ei saa kõike seda, mida vaja.

Hard to believe he's not here.	Raske uskuda, et teda pole siin.

He had done it.	Ta oli sellega hakkama saanud.
We probably should.	Tõenäoliselt peaksime.

But then maybe it is.	Aga siis võib-olla on.
It was never done at that time.	Sel ajal polnud seda kunagi teha.
He hasn't done it yet.	Ta pole seda veel teinud.
He wasn't sure what to expect, what he would do.	Ta ei olnud kindel, mida oodata, mida ta teeb.

He does too.	Tema teeb ka.
I'm just not sure what it is.	Ma lihtsalt pole kindel, mis see on.
You've always wanted to talk about it.	Oled alati tahtnud sellest rääkida.

That would have been too easy.	See oleks olnud liiga lihtne.
I know you have to.	Ma tean, et sa pead seda tegema.

He really wanted to get out, he really wanted to.	Ta tahtis tõesti välja saada, ta tõesti tahtis.
He never comes home.	Ta ei tule kunagi koju.
But we had a lot of time.	Aga meil oli palju aega.
So that's the problem.	Nii et see on probleem.

If not this year, maybe next.	Kui mitte sel aastal, siis võib-olla järgmisel.
Maybe he could talk to him.	Võib-olla saaks ta temaga rääkida.
And that's when it came for us.	Ja see oli siis, kui see meie jaoks tuli.

That's pretty good.	See on päris hea.
Not really.	Ei ole tegelikult.
He just.	Ta lihtsalt.
But it wasn't just the mother.	Kuid see polnud ainult ema.
They are not good for you.	Need ei ole sulle head.
Are you at all.	Kas sa oled üldse.

I have nothing.	Mul ei ole midagi.

That said a lot about who you were.	See ütles palju selle kohta, kes sa olid.
Tell me exactly what's going on.	Räägi mulle täpselt, mis toimub.
I never believe that.	Ma ei usu seda kunagi.
He wouldn't do that.	Ta ei teeks sellist asja.
If not, that's fine.	Kui ei, siis on see ka täiesti hea.
And he wanted to be.	Ja ta tahtis olla.
I can't say why.	Ma ei oska öelda, miks.
But it's hard for him to be with us.	Aga tal on raske meiega koos olla.
I know he can do it.	Ma tean, et ta suudab seda teha.

He doesn't know the language.	Ta ei oska keelt.

It's none of my business.	See pole minu asi.

But what if he doesn't.	Aga mis siis, kui ta seda ei tee.
I probably shouldn't talk about it.	Ma ilmselt ei peaks sellest rääkima.
I don't think there's much you can do.	Ma arvan, et sa ei saa eriti midagi teha.

I do not believe it.	Ma ei usu seda.
He should be home soon.	Ta peaks varsti kodus olema.

No one knows where you are now.	Keegi ei tea, kus sa praegu oled.
There would have been no more.	Rohkem poleks saanud.
Everything went well.	Kõik läks hästi.
His mother comes with him.	Tema ema tuleb temaga kaasa.
I have done something with it.	Ma olen sellega midagi teinud.
If only we had more time.	Kui meil oleks olnud rohkem aega.
It was really hard for me.	Mul oli tõesti raske.
And he's not done yet.	Ja ta pole veel lõpetanud.
He will never be able to do this again.	Ta ei saa sellega enam kunagi hakkama.
We have work to do here.	Meil on siin tööd teha.
Then you don't need me.	Siis pole sul mind vaja.
So now you've told everyone.	Nii et nüüd olete kõigile öelnud.
He didn't say anything about it.	Ta ei öelnud selle kohta midagi.
He's been there.	Ta on seal olnud.
You never know when.	Sa ei tea kunagi, millal.
Not about that.	Mitte selle kohta.
When he said he had her, he had her.	Kui ta ütles, et tal on ta, siis tal oli ta.
He just fell asleep.	Ta jäi lihtsalt magama.
It's your business.	See on sinu asi.
I'm not waiting anymore.	Ma ei oota enam.
He can't talk to her.	Ta ei saa temaga rääkida.
There is no more time.	Aega enam pole.
But it doesn't have to.	Aga see ei pea.
I agreed to do almost everything.	Olin nõus peaaegu kõike tegema.
He didn't know what else to say.	Ta ei teadnud, mida veel öelda.
There is nothing here.	Siin pole midagi.
Wanted more.	Tahtis veel.

Then it will all come back to me.	Siis tuleb see kõik mulle tagasi.
There has never been anything like it.	Midagi sellist pole kunagi olnud.
That was good.	See oli hea.
Me neither.	Mina ka mitte.
He can't say anything either.	Ta ei saa ka midagi öelda.
Can anyone help me please.	Kas keegi saab mind aidata palun.
I didn't go out and do my job.	Ma ei läinud välja ja ei teinud oma tööd.
Same house.	Sama maja.
Then he heard nothing.	Siis ta ei kuulnud midagi.
Where is the damage ?.	Kus on kahju?.

It's really happening.	See tõesti toimub.
Everything that was here wouldn't be too much.	Kõike, mis siin oli, poleks liiga palju.
He told us about it.	Ta rääkis meile sellest.
This is bad.	See on halb.
He went down.	Ta läks alla.
Not like he had.	Mitte nagu tal oli.
No one gets just good.	Keegi ei saa ainult head.
Then everything died.	Siis suri kõik.
He wouldn't have survived it.	Ta ei oleks suutnud seda üle elada.
He got a job.	Ta sai tööd.
He said he was afraid to come home.	Ütles, et kardab koju tulla.
Now is the time.	Nüüd on aeg.
He said no.	Ta ütles, et ei ole.
Not all of it is certain.	Mitte kõik see pole kindel.
I just want to see him at home.	Ma tahan teda lihtsalt kodus näha.
It's not over.	See ei ole läbi.
You have to tell him and tell him now.	Sa pead talle ütlema ja ütlema talle kohe.
He can handle it.	Ta saab sellega hakkama.
I didn't even know.	Ma isegi ei teadnud.
I hope he still has it.	Loodan, et tal on see ikka alles.
He said he was coming.	Ta ütles, et ta tuleb.
He said it was good for you.	Ta ütles, et see on sulle hea.
It's really hard work.	See on tõesti raske töö.
This is a very big deal.	See on väga suur asi.
Not my father either.	Mu isa ka mitte.
That's where he goes.	Sinna ta läheb.
I want to know how best to do that.	Ma tahan teada, kuidas seda kõige paremini teha.
And if you ever think, don't tell me.	Ja kui sa kunagi arvad, siis ära ütle mulle.
It just came out.	See tuli just välja.
I didn't understand that.	Ma ei saanud sellest aru.
But he can't drive.	Aga ta ei oska sõita.
It is now.	Praegu on see.
This is not a job.	See pole töö.
I never liked it.	See ei meeldinud ka mitte kunagi.
Not sure exactly.	Pole kindel, mis täpselt.
I will never let him know.	Ma ei lase tal kunagi teada saada.
Come through.	Tule läbi.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Ta ei taha sellest rääkida.
He would still be there if it weren't for him.	Ta oleks endiselt seal, kui see poleks olnud tema.
I never wanted to see it again.	Ma ei tahtnud seda enam kunagi näha.
He knew her pretty well, too.	Ta tundis teda ka üsna hästi.
He definitely didn't want to talk about it.	Ta kindlasti ei tahtnud sellest rääkida.
I understand that not everyone feels this way.	Ma saan aru, et mitte kõik ei tunne seda nii.
He probably already knows if he got it.	Tõenäoliselt ta juba teab, kas ta sai selle.
He knew it would be over soon.	Ta teadis, et see saab varsti läbi.
And there was something else.	Ja seal oli veel midagi.
I'm really sorry about you.	Mul on sinust tegelikult kahju.
I'm having trouble with that.	Mul on sellega probleeme.
This is something that works and works fast.	See on midagi, mis töötab ja töötab kiiresti.

His first mother.	Tema esimene ema.
But here you have to be.	Aga siin sa pead olema.
I said you're not coming.	Ma ütlesin, et sa ei tule.
I think he has to.	Ma arvan, et ta peab.
I'll get it back well.	Ma saan selle hästi tagasi.
I don't know we should be.	Ma ei tea, et me peaksime olema.
He wasn't waiting for us.	Ta ei oodanud meid.
This is a good house.	See on hea maja.
This is not a mistake.	See pole viga.
He could get her back.	Ta saaks ta tagasi.
It's all good and good.	See kõik on hea ja hea.
Only one thing remained.	Ainult üks asi jäi alles.
He always wants it.	Ta tahab seda alati.
You are doing well now.	Praegu läheb sul hästi.
It would be good to be at home.	Hea oleks kodus olla.
I doubt you ever will.	Ma kahtlen, et sa seda kunagi teed.
He had done it before.	Ta oli seda varem teinud.
I didn't quite understand.	Ma ei saanud päris aru.
Not me.	Mitte mina .
It seems almost too good to be true.	Tundub peaaegu liiga hea, et tõsi olla.
And he with you.	Ja ta koos sinuga.
Maybe absolutely so.	Võib-olla täiesti nii.
I can't even be a mother.	Ma ei saa isegi ema olla.
I'm just glad it's over.	Mul on lihtsalt hea meel, et see läbi on.
He never said it would be easy.	Ta pole kunagi öelnud, et see oleks lihtne.
It stayed for me.	Minu jaoks jäi.

That was then.	See oli siis.
And then it all came back.	Ja siis tuli kõik tagasi.
They've been there all along.	Nad on seal olnud kogu aeg.
It too does it for everyone.	See liiga teeb seda kõigile.
It was great to come to you.	Sinust oli suur tulla.
He didn't want to come.	Ta ei tahtnud tulla.
But in fact it was.	Aga tegelikult oli nii.
Life had done enough for him.	Tema jaoks oli elu piisavalt teinud.
I hope we can get them all out.	Loodan, et saame nad kõik välja.
I hope to see you again someday.	Loodan sind kunagi veel näha.
This is my house now.	See on nüüd minu maja.
And here he just looked.	Ja siin ta lihtsalt vaatas.
They get nothing.	Nad ei saa midagi.
He stayed there and many people came to him.	Ta jäi sinna ja palju inimesi tuli tema juurde.
That's what he did for himself.	Seda ta tegi enda jaoks.
Back, back, back.	Tagasi, tagasi, tagasi.
One, he couldn't live.	Üks, ta ei saanud elada.
Not in.	Pole sisse saanud.
They couldn't be here.	Nad ei saanud siin olla.
I don't know him anymore.	Ma ei tunne teda enam.
I want it.	Ma tahan seda .
But then you could.	Aga siis võiks.
Me neither.	Mina ka mitte.
I'm worried about you.	Ma olen teie pärast mures.
John, three more years.	Johni, veel kolm aastat.
If they were me, if they were me.	Kui nad oleksin mina, kui nad oleksin mina.

It won't let you.	See ei lase sul.
Good job, kid.	Hea töö, poiss.
That's good, he said.	See on hea, ütles ta.
He was definitely over it.	Ta oli sellest kindlasti üle saanud.
But there is one.	Aga üks on.
That's not all.	See pole veel kõik.
I guess you weren't there yet.	Sa vist polnud seal veel.
Actually even better.	Tegelikult isegi parem.
And if so, good for you.	Ja kui nii, siis hea teile.
You can't tell anyone.	Sa ei saa seda kellelegi rääkida.

I do not understand.	ma ei saa aru.
The money is out.	Raha on väljas.

He didn't even have it for himself.	Tal polnud seda isegi enda jaoks.
If anything, he was very good.	Kui midagi, siis ta oli väga hea.

I should say.	Ma peaksin ütlema.
It's his mind.	See on tema meel.
I get it all the time.	Ma saan sellest kogu aeg aru.
I would never do that.	Ma ei teeks seda kunagi.
Not even that.	Isegi seda mitte.
But eventually he did.	Kuid lõpuks ta tegi seda.
Although this is usually true.	Kuigi see on tavaliselt tõsi.
There must be something wrong.	Midagi peab viga olema.
You don't really want to know.	Sa ei taha tegelikult teada.

You don't feel anything.	Sa ei tunne midagi.
That's what you think.	Seda sa arvad.
One problem still remains.	Üks probleem on endiselt alles.
If not, then no.	Kui ei, siis mitte.
In the end, no.	Lõpuks mitte.
It is unknown whether this was the case.	Kas see nii oli, pole teada.
He's all alone there.	Ta on seal täiesti üksi.
I just like coming here.	Mulle lihtsalt meeldib siia tulla.
And he too.	Ja tema ka.
You have to go.	Sa pead minema.
It seemed that he could only help.	Tundus, et ta saab ainult aidata.
When he felt it.	Kui ta seda tundis.
I don't have much to tell you.	Mul pole sulle palju öelda.
I just don't know that.	Ma lihtsalt ei tea seda.
You are his mother.	Sa oled tema ema.
They don't seem to be doing anything at all.	Tundub, et nad ei tee üldse midagi.
I would never do that right now.	Ma ei teeks seda praegu kunagi.
Your wife.	Sinu naine .
We can win from this.	Me saame sellest võita.
I have to say that.	Ma pean seda ütlema.
And it must be.	Ja see peab olema.
But she didn't believe him.	Kuid ta ei uskunud teda.
You have no one.	Sul pole kedagi.
I've never been there before.	Ma pole seal kunagi varem käinud.
And it wasn't mine either.	Ja see polnud ka minu oma.
You are already me.	Sa oled juba mina.
Everything is ready.	Kõik on valmis.
There is no real money.	Tegelikult pole raha.
I was worried.	Ma olin mures.
He asked how many people were there.	Ta küsis, kui palju inimesi seal on.

I must have some time.	Mul peab olema natuke aega.
Not quite that.	Mitte päris seda.
It wasn't that long ago.	See ei olnud nii väga kaua aega tagasi.
That's exactly what he needs.	See on täpselt see, mida ta vajab.
He had never been before.	Ta polnud kunagi varem olnud.
And no one is coming.	Ja keegi ei tule.
Something like that .	Midagi sellist .
That's what we're good at.	Selles me oleme head.
He's not that old.	Ta pole nii vana.
If something happens, you didn't see me tonight.	Kui midagi juhtub, siis te ei näinud mind täna õhtul.
You're already here.	Sa oled juba siin.
It's out now.	See on nüüd väljas.
They really were.	Nad olid tõesti.
It had never been.	Seda polnud kunagi olnud.
Just like we always have.	Täpselt nagu meil alati on olnud.

And he really wants it.	Ja ta tahab seda väga.
It's now or never.	See on nüüd või mitte kunagi.
Not so hard.	Mitte nii raske.
Probably more than you have.	Tõenäoliselt rohkem kui teil on.
This was not the time.	See ei olnud aeg.
Here's an opportunity.	Siin on võimalus.
And then he starts talking.	Ja siis hakkab ta rääkima.
He must have been a very good man, your father.	Ta pidi olema väga hea mees, teie isa.
They said he was a good man.	Nad ütlesid, et ta on hea mees.
I suspect he didn't.	Ma kahtlustan, et ta ei teinud seda.
I know there is nothing wrong with him.	Ma tean, et tal pole midagi viga.
You told me.	Sa ütlesid mulle.
All three of you.	Te kõik kolm.
It will never come.	See ei tule kunagi.

I saw it now.	Ma nägin seda nüüd.
Like very bad, so it was hard.	Nagu väga halb, nii et see oli raske.

I was at home.	Ma olin kodus.
He's seen it all.	Ta on seda kõike näinud.
I never want to see you again.	Ma ei taha sind enam kunagi näha.
I think that was to be expected.	Ma arvan, et seda oli oodata.
Nobody wants to play with us.	Keegi ei taha meiega mängida.
But it wasn't true.	Aga see polnud tõsi.
Mom wasn't there.	Ema polnud seal.
He did it now.	Ta tegi seda nüüd.
And that's not all.	Ega see pole veel kõik.
You don't talk much.	Sa ei räägi palju.
His friend had not seen him through.	Tema sõber polnud teda läbi näinud.
No, there was no way.	Ei, polnud võimalust.
I didn't quite understand that.	Ma ei saanud sellest päris aru.
How he asked.	Kuidas ta seda küsis.
It was his house.	See oli tema maja.
But now he didn't have time.	Aga nüüd ei olnud tal aega.
This is often a good thing.	See on sageli hea asi.
It doesn't exist anymore.	Seda enam ei ole.
When they're gone, they're gone.	Kui nad on läinud, on nad läinud.
All against me.	Kõik minu vastu.
There is so much in it.	Selles on nii palju.
I didn't understand myself.	Ma ei saanud ise aru.
Now is the only time.	Nüüd on ainuke aeg.
I always do.	Ma teen seda alati.
Now is his time to wait.	Nüüd on tema aeg oodata.
This was his chance.	See oli tema võimalus.
But that's not the only problem.	Kuid see pole ainus probleem.
It has to be.	See peab olema.
My father is an old man.	Mu isa on vana mees.
You don't have to tell us why this happened.	Te ei pea meile ütlema, miks see juhtus.
No one really knew what it was.	Keegi ei teadnud tegelikult, mis see oli.
It's just your way.	See on lihtsalt teie tee.
He does it all the time.	Ta teeb seda kogu aeg.
Nobody remembers what he said.	Keegi ei mäleta, mida ta ütles.
I know you're already doing that.	Ma tean, et sa seda juba teed.
And then he's gone.	Ja siis ta on läinud.
And it was now.	Ja see oli nüüd.
Works pretty fast.	Töötab päris kiiresti.
He was the one who did it.	Tema oli see, kes tegi.
That would be something.	See oleks midagi.
And it did that to him.	Ja see tegi seda temaga.
You just know what to do.	Sa lihtsalt tead, mida teha.
There was no time to say anything then.	Siis polnud aega midagi öelda.
It was no longer life at all.	See ei olnud enam üldse elu.
It's easy enough to do.	Seda on piisavalt lihtne teha.
So now you will find out.	Nii et nüüd saate selle teada.
But can not.	Aga ei saa.
And so was he.	Ja nii oli ka tema.
I really would.	ma tõesti teeks.
It was too.	See oli ka.
He can go.	Ta võib minna.
He was doing well.	Tal läks kõik hästi.
Today was much better.	Täna oli palju parem.
The point is that .	Asi on selles et .
The reason for this was simple.	Põhjus selleks oli lihtne.
And this was not the case here.	Ja siin see nii ei olnud.
This is simply not the case here.	Siin see lihtsalt nii ei ole.
He would want him again.	Ta tahaks teda uuesti.
It's just a very difficult time.	Praegu on lihtsalt väga raske aeg.
Very beautiful, simple and beautiful.	Väga ilus, lihtne ja ilus.
That's what he's done.	Seda ta on teinud.
It has to be big money.	See peab olema suur raha.
I would never, ever do that to anyone.	Ma ei teeks kunagi, mitte kunagi kellelegi nii.
That's mine.	See on minu oma.
It's a good feeling.	See on hea tunne.
But he is not happy.	Aga ta ei ole õnnelik.
They were almost done.	Nad olid peaaegu valmis.
It's not his.	See pole tema oma.
But there may be one thing they don't know.	Kuid võib olla üks asi, mida nad ei tea.
So there they are.	Nii et need on.
You never have to be alone.	Sa ei pea kunagi üksi olema.
You have to go now.	Sa pead nüüd minema.
It came back to me pretty quickly.	See tuli mulle üsna kiiresti tagasi.

We never went there.	Me ei käinud seal kunagi.
He is so good.	Ta on nii hea.
It seems to be good.	Tundub, et see on hea.
Mom wasn't here.	Ema ei olnud siin.

This house is yours.	See maja on teie.
He wasn't old enough.	Ta ei olnud piisavalt vana.
It was a woman, but it wasn't human.	See oli naine, kuid see polnud inimene.
I do not know what to say.	Ma ei tea, mida öelda.
He had to be alone.	Ta pidi üksi olema.
He was ready for me.	Ta oli minu jaoks valmis.
No place for me.	Minu jaoks pole kohta.
I didn't even seem to be myself.	Ma ei paistnud isegi olevat mina ise.
.	.
We have to do it.	Peame seda tegema.
Maybe he still did.	Võib-olla ta ikka tegi.
They definitely are.	Nad kindlasti on.
Here, a man can do anything.	Siin saab mees kõike teha.
That would not be difficult.	See ei oleks raske.
Tell me what happened.	Räägi, mis juhtus.
If not, we won't.	Kui ei, siis me mitte.
All or nothing.	Kõik või mitte midagi.
So it's always been that way.	Nii et see on alati nii olnud.
He didn't like what he saw.	Talle ei meeldinud see, mida ta nägi.
And they never do.	Ja nad ei tee seda kunagi.
I think you find him interesting.	Ma arvan, et ta on teile huvitav.

I was so surprised.	Ma olin nii üllatunud.
I'm really worried about you.	Ma olen sinu pärast tõesti mures.
But that can't tell us anything about it.	Kuid see ei saa meile selle kohta midagi öelda.
And it will never be again.	Ja ei saa enam kunagi olema.
It had been so good.	See oli nii hea olnud.
I'm begging you.	Ma palun sind.
Indeed, it happened.	Tõesti, see juhtus.
I'm afraid not.	Kardan, et mitte.
.	.
But tonight he wouldn't.	Aga täna õhtul ta seda ei teeks.
I'm with you.	Ma olen sinuga.
He knows what you want to buy before you do.	Ta teab, mida sa osta tahad, enne kui teed.
We must be ready now.	Peame kohe valmis olema.
It always is.	See on alati nii.
Could someone help me.	Keegi võiks mind aidata.
And it looks like he did.	Ja tundub, et ta tegi seda.
No one spoke against it at the time.	Sel ajal ei rääkinud keegi selle vastu.
He gave it back to him.	Ta andis selle talle tagasi.

I don't think you knew.	Ma arvan, et sa ei teadnud.
I don't know why, everything seems fine to me.	Ma ei tea, miks, kõik tundub mulle hea.
I don't think he can.	Ma ei usu, et ta suudab.

I like to eat well.	Mulle meeldib hästi süüa.

Or his own.	Või tema oma.
So those were the roads.	Nii et need olid teed.
It was beautiful, absolutely beautiful.	See oli ilus, täiesti ilus.
Now he's done it.	Nüüd on ta sellega hakkama saanud.
But it was beautiful.	Aga ilus oli.
His head was heavy.	Ta pea oli raske.
What it really was, it was.	Mis see tegelikult oli, oli see.
I was so worried.	Ma olin nii mures.
Maybe he had already done it.	Võib-olla oli ta juba sellega hakkama saanud.
This is probably also a mistake.	Ilmselt on see ka viga.
We're not doing anything tonight.	Me ei tee sel õhtul midagi.

He knows it now.	Ta teab seda nüüd.
I know you don't like it.	Ma tean, et see sulle ei meeldi.
Especially when there is so much going on.	Eriti kui toimub nii palju.

You can't win.	Sa ei saa võita.

It should be easy to see.	Seda peaks olema lihtne näha.
And so did my father.	Ja nii ka minu isa.
This can also be a big problem.	See võib olla ka suur probleem.
You said .	Sa ütlesid .
He knew they were against it.	Ta teadis, et nad on vastu.
I saw it all the time.	Ma nägin seda kogu aeg.
I have to say something.	Ma pean midagi ütlema.
He didn't know what his problem was.	Ta ei teadnud, mis tema probleem on.
Be good to him.	Ole tema vastu hea.
That was my problem.	See oli minu probleem.
I didn't know what.	Ma ei teadnud, mida.
Quite often, however, more is needed.	Üsna sageli on aga vaja rohkem.
There seemed to be a lot of work to be done.	Tundus palju tööd olevat.
But it's hard to be here.	Aga siin on raske olla.
You should tell him that.	Sa peaksid talle seda ütlema.
That's just the way it is.	See lihtsalt on nii.
You can see it.	Seda saab näha .
All in all.	Kõik selles.
There is another reason.	On veel üks põhjus.
He told them they wouldn't be interested.	Ütles talle, et nad ei oleks huvitatud.
He knows where he went.	Ta teab, kuhu ta läks.
We can't do that again.	Me ei saa seda uuesti teha.
Both were gone.	Mõlemad olid läinud.
But he would be the same person.	Aga ta oleks sama inimene.
I just saw it.	Just nägin seda.
It would probably have been too easy.	Ilmselt oleks see liiga lihtne olnud.
This is not .	See ei ole .
The man has to say something.	Mees peab midagi ütlema.
I always thought it was me.	Ma arvasin alati, et see olen mina.
Especially my parents.	Eriti mu vanemad.
Maybe his only friend.	Võib-olla tema ainus sõber.
He had never seen anything like it.	Ta polnud kunagi sellist näinud.
Just come down, Dad.	Tule lihtsalt alla, isa.
This is not such a big problem.	See pole nii suur probleem.
I just want to do it myself right now.	Ma tahan seda praegu lihtsalt ise teha.
He knew where he was.	Ta teadis, kus ta on.
He just does it.	Ta lihtsalt teeb seda.
You're just human.	Sa oled lihtsalt inimene.
One is .	Üks on .
And one for me too.	Ja üks mulle ka.
But not anymore.	Aga mitte enam.
But never.	Aga mitte kunagi.
You are the reason.	Sina oled põhjus.
It's not always easy.	See pole alati lihtne.
He had never seen anything like this before.	Ta polnud kunagi varem midagi sellist näinud.
I'm not.	Ma ei ole see.
Everything can be done today.	Täna saab kõike teha.
I'll be fine.	Minuga saab kõik korda.
I really wish it was.	Ma tõesti soovin, et see oleks.

I'm almost done now.	Ma olen nüüd peaaegu läbi.
It works well now.	Nüüd töötab hästi.
You knew that.	Sa teadsid seda.
He could know exactly who you are.	Ta saaks täpselt teada, kes sa oled.
It was for me.	Minu jaoks oli see.
He asked for help.	Ta palus abi.
He didn't think they were.	Ta ei arvanud, et need on.
They both knew it.	Nad mõlemad teadsid seda.
Maybe it can.	Võib-olla võib.
But he didn't say no either.	Aga ta ei öelnud ka ei.
Nobody knows me now.	Keegi ei tunne mind nüüd.
I thought it was necessary.	Minu arvates oli seda vaja.
Can someone please help me.	Kas keegi saaks mind palun aidata.
.	.
He wanted to help her.	Ta tahtis teda aidata.
I didn't want to tell him.	Ma ei tahtnud talle seda öelda.
Then everything will be fine.	Siis saab kõik korda.
What are you doing.	Mida sa teed.
Me? 	Mina?
I know there's nothing there.	Ma tean, et seal pole midagi.
I used to do something like that.	Kunagi tegin midagi sellist.
He was sure it would always be that way.	Ta oli kindel, et nii läheb alati.
But you don't have to do that anymore.	Aga seda ei pea enam tegema.
Perhaps more than necessary.	Võib-olla rohkem kui vaja.
My father was very interested in it.	Mu isa oli sellest väga huvitatud.
You are not.	Sa ei ole .
The problem is that no one wanted to buy me.	Probleem on selles, et keegi ei tahtnud mind osta.
I need something.	Mul on midagi vaja.
He was his fire and his fire was his.	Ta oli tema tuli ja tema tuli oli tema.
I don't know what to say about that.	Ma ei tea, mida selle kohta öelda.
We can't live like this anymore.	Me ei saa enam nii elada.
I really have.	Mul on tõesti.
You just have to go with it.	Sa pead sellega lihtsalt kaasa minema.
I'm going home too.	ma lähen ka koju.
I was a lot.	Ma olin palju.
He looked at me but said nothing.	Ta vaatas mind, kuid ei öelnud midagi.
I don't remember anymore.	Rohkem ma ei mäleta.
Why was it there.	Miks see seal oli.
Then he went to sleep.	Siis läks magama.
Now he understood.	Nüüd sai ta aru.
You're still interested.	Sa oled endiselt huvitatud.
How quickly, how easily it came.	Kui kiiresti, kui lihtsalt see tuli.
But it was hard.	Aga see oli raske.
I'm there.	Ma olen seal.
Everyone knew and no one did anything.	Kõik teadsid ja keegi ei teinud midagi.
He told me where that money was.	Ta ütles mulle, kus see raha on.
You don't want it to be either.	Sa ei taha, et see ka oleks.
That would be .	See oleks .
But only you know that.	Aga ainult sina tead seda.
That must be done.	Seda tuleb teha.
So he was.	Nii ta oli.
No, he looked healthy as always.	Ei, ta nägi terve välja nagu alati.
Really, there was no place to wait.	Tõesti, polnud enam kohta oodata.
It can't be good for him.	See ei saa olla talle hea.
I've never been there.	Ma ei ole seal kunagi olnud.
He felt a little better right away.	Ta tundis end kohe veidi paremini.
He said he had.	Ta ütles, et tal oli.
It all works well.	Kõik see töötab hästi.
You can get help, you don't have to cook.	Abi saab, ei pea süüa tegema.
But that's his business.	Aga see on tema asi.
You can help me here.	Siin saate mind aidata.
He had seen what he had seen.	Ta oli näinud seda, mida ta oli näinud.
He would never have her.	Tal poleks teda kunagi.
It always seems to go that way.	Tundub, et see läheb alati nii.
Maybe he can do something.	Võib-olla saab ta midagi teha.
And he is there.	Ja ta on seal.
I love seeing you like this.	Mulle meeldib sind nii näha.
Do it.	Tee seda.
I wonder how that happened.	Huvitav, kuidas see juhtus.
A lot of good.	Palju head.
But maybe you didn't want that.	Aga võib-olla sa ei tahtnud seda.
He just does.	Ta lihtsalt teeb.
He likes it the way it is.	Talle meeldib see nii nagu see on.
Just very quickly.	Lihtsalt väga kiiresti.
I doubt I'll ever know.	Kahtlen, kas kunagi teada saan.
Why would that be.	Miks oleks.
Then he said it.	Siis ta ütles seda.
He knew he hadn't.	Ta teadis, et tal polnud.
How then.	Kuidas siis.
I'm not that worried about it.	Ma ei ole selle pärast nii mures.
We don't know when it will be.	Me ei tea, millal see saab.
But it went well.	Aga läks hästi.
They didn't even know if it was good or not.	Nad isegi ei teadnud, kas see oli hea või mitte.
I haven't done anything myself.	Ma pole ise midagi teinud.
I have some work to do.	Mul on natuke tööd.
You do not understand.	Sa ei saa aru.
All three times.	Kõik kolm korda.
There must be a mistake.	Peab olema viga.
However, this is not the case yet.	See aga veel nii ei ole.
It's pretty big.	See on üsna suur.
I've never heard of it before.	Ma pole sellest kunagi varem kuulnud.
But it was good.	Aga see oli hea.
You don't remember.	Sa ei mäleta.
Everyone should go home now.	Kõik peaksid nüüd koju minema.
I'm not your father.	Ma ei ole su isa.
And if we didn't like it.	Ja kui see meile ei meeldinud.
It's going to be pretty good.	Päris hea saab olema.

You are doing well.	Sul läheb hästi.
Much, much more.	Palju, palju rohkem.
You're big time, man.	Sa oled suur aeg, mees.
