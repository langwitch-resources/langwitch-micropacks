To me, that’s not right.	Amiko dia tsy mety izany.
The first reason is to play music.	Ny antony voalohany dia ny milalao mozika.
You could hardly look at the above.	Saika tsy afaka nijery an'io ambony io ianao.

In the previous day.	Tamin'ny andro teo aloha.
I didn’t understand what was going on there.	Tsy azoko ny zava-nitranga tao.
I am very sick.	Tena marary aho.
Sure they have it.	Azo antoka fa manana izany izy ireo.
She is very afraid of him.	Tena matahotra azy izy.
Both said no, to my surprise.	Samy nilaza hoe tsia, ka gaga aho.

It's a small house.	Trano kely io.
I told them about the door.	Nolazaiko azy ireo ny momba ny varavarana.
The food was delicious.	Nahafinaritra ny sakafo.
He has no heart for it.	Tsy manana ny fony amin'izany izy.
They may be different, but they can do great things.	Mety ho hafa izy ireo, saingy afaka manao zavatra lehibe.
I don’t want to see where it is now.	Tsy te hahita izay misy aho ankehitriny.

The days went by.	Nandeha ny andro.
Are you from here	Avy eto ve ianao?
What brought him here.	Inona no nahatonga azy teto.
We don’t have to be here today.	Tsy voatery ho eto izahay androany.
They are long gone.	Efa ela izy ireo no lasa.
He has a dog.	Manana alika izy.
I think they are and have been for a long time.	Heveriko fa izy ireo ary efa ela be.
But not enough, not close enough.	Saingy tsy ampy, tsy akaiky ny ampy.
He wasn’t very good in the rain.	Tsy dia tsara loatra izy tamin'ny orana.
I'm sorry no.	Miala tsiny aho fa tsia.
In fact, baby, that's not true.	Raha ny marina, zaza, tsy marina izany.
I don't think so.	Heveriko fa tsy izany.
Surely he has a more powerful way.	Azo antoka fa manana fomba mahery kokoa izy.
It was not a pleasant little house.	Tsy trano kely nahafinaritra azy io.

I don't want to go back to school.	Tsy te hiverina hianatra aho.
Dogs are just like humans.	Ny alika dia mitovy amin'ny olona.
You didn’t need it.	Tsy nila izany ianao.
This person died instantly.	Maty teo no ho eo io olona io.
However, they have already tried.	Na izany aza, efa nanandrana izy ireo.
No one seemed to be there.	Toa tsy nisy olona teo.
And there is no reason to do it here.	Ary tsy misy antony tokony hanaovana izany eto.

However this is not guaranteed.	Na izany aza tsy misy antoka izany.

We didn’t think much about it.	Tsy dia nieritreritra firy momba izany izahay.
We were no different.	Tsy nisy hafa izahay.
It’s just too big.	Lehibe lavitra ihany.
In fact, people don’t talk about anything else.	Raha ny marina, tsy miresaka zavatra hafa ny olona.
I have too much to do.	Be loatra ny zavatra tokony hataoko.
I hope this helps people.	Manantena aho fa hanampy olona izany.
It was hard for him to get it.	Sarotra taminy ny nahazo azy.
Maybe it’s something for next year.	Zavatra ho an'ny taona manaraka angamba izany.
We are very busy.	Tena sahirana izahay.
Even now, he might do it.	Na dia izao aza dia mety manao izany izy.
Finally, this is the good news.	Farany, izany no vaovao tsara.
I hope he has.	Manantena aho fa manana izy.
No, neither is it.	Tsia, tsy izany koa.
Anything can happen, you know.	Mety hitranga ny zava-drehetra, fantatrao.
He stopped as soon as he saw the picture.	Nijanona izy raha vao nahita ilay sary.
But don't go.	Fa aza mandeha.
There is no reason for that.	Tsy misy antony izany.
He’s just doing the wrong thing, over and over again.	Manao zavatra tsy mety fotsiny izy, hatrany hatrany hatrany.

Worst of many.	Ratsy indrindra amin'ny maro.
The house is very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy ilay trano.
I heard them.	Nandre azy ireo aho.
Mrs.	Ny.
It’s almost there now.	Efa saika misy izany ankehitriny.
If you follow.	Raha manaraka ianao.
This or not.	Ity na tsia.
Even when we are alone, we are never alone.	Na dia irery aza isika dia tsy irery mihitsy.
It still seems too small.	Toa mbola kely loatra.
I saw him almost every day.	Saika isan’andro aho no nahita azy manokana.
He worked hard.	Niasa mafy izy.
But it’s a good picture.	Saingy sary tsara izany.
Very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy.
I had to have.	Tsy maintsy nanana aho.
It’s more of an idea.	Hevitra kokoa izany.
He didn't see very well.	Tsy dia nahita tsara izy.
We’ll get back to that later.	Mbola hiverina amin'izany isika rehefa avy eo.
He should have come back for it.	Tokony niverina ho azy izy.
If it was really bad, they stopped.	Raha tena ratsy tokoa izany dia nijanona izy ireo.
I don't understand that.	Tsy azoko izany.
In fact, he did well.	Nanao tsara izy, raha ny marina.
He is not with me.	Tsy eto amiko izy.
Not three, not more, only two.	Tsy telo, tsy mihoatra, roa ihany.
We are the only ones who still have them today.	Isika ihany no mbola manana azy ireo ankehitriny.
This is the problem.	Izao no olana.
In the end, the kids loved it.	Tamin'ny farany, ny ankizy dia tia azy io.
No one heard me.	Tsy nisy nandre ahy izy ireo.
The problem is we are.	Ny olana dia isika no izy.
They both looked at the girl.	Samy nijery ilay tovovavy izy ireo.
Not just with me.	Tsy miaraka amiko fotsiny.
The children slept there.	Natory tamin’izany ny ankizy.
And they really are.	Ary tena izy ireo.
I will definitely be back.	Tena hiverina aho.
I know that.	Fantatro izany.
He was the only one who didn't have it.	Izy irery no tsy nanana.
There is still much to be done.	Mbola betsaka ny tokony hatao.
They look fun.	Toa mahafinaritra izy ireo.
Not the first, you know.	Tsy ny voalohany, fantatrao.
I just couldn’t eat it.	Tsy afaka nihinana azy fotsiny aho.
There was something bigger than that.	Nisy zavatra lehibe kokoa noho izany.
It’s really good and really easy.	Tena tsara sy mora tokoa izany.
We drive better.	Mandeha fiara tsara kokoa izahay.
No, it's too late.	Tsia fa tara loatra izao.
Which he didn’t want to get.	Izay tsy tiany ho azo.
This is, to me, a problem.	Ity, amiko, olana.
I need to sleep but I can't.	Mila matory aho fa tsy afaka.
Thanks but no.	Misaotra fa tsia.
It's too hard.	Sarotra loatra izany.
They will not be there.	Tsy ho eo izy ireo.
Maybe time will tell.	Angamba ny fotoana no hilaza.
He could still do it.	Mbola afaka nanao izany izy.
She's going home to the kids.	Hody any amin’ny ankizy izy.
This is not mine!	Tsy ahy ity!
Or you can have anything.	Na afaka manana na inona na inona ianao.
Nothing good.	Tsy nisy zavatra tsara.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
I don't know that.	Tsy fantatro izany.
It was so nice to have him at home.	Tena nahafinaritra ny nanana azy tao an-trano.
The land is good, and so are the houses.	Tsara ny tany, ary toy izany koa ny trano.
But that is not true.	Saingy tsy marina izany.
Now he had to go and do it.	Tsy maintsy nandeha nanao izany izy izao.
He didn’t see it because it was impossible.	Tsy nahita izany izy satria tsy azo atao izany.
He lived alone with a dog.	Nipetraka irery niaraka tamin'ny alika iray izy.
I went into it.	Niditra tao aminy aho.
He did not know where it came from.	Tsy fantany hoe avy taiza izy io.
I see something in you.	Mahita zavatra ao aminao aho.
He is now working.	Efa niasa izy izao.
I have to say it’s really good.	Tsy maintsy milaza aho fa tena tsara.
That’s right, for sure.	Izany tokoa, azo antoka.
I knew right away that he had nothing.	Fantatro avy hatrany fa tsy nanana na inona na inona izy.
It takes a lot of time.	Mila fotoana be izany.
It works for me right now.	Miasa ho ahy izany amin'izao fotoana izao.
Yes, not this one.	Eny, tsy ity iray ity.
It couldn’t be more accurate.	Tsy mety ho marina kokoa izany.
He asked her.	Nanontany azy izy.
Not just today.	Tsy androany ihany.
It’s big now.	Lehibe izany ankehitriny.
He didn't even know what he would do when he got there.	Tsy fantany akory izay hataony raha tonga any izy.
Or thought of many other things as well.	Na nieritreritra zavatra maro hafa koa.
Here it is !.	Ity ary!.
People don’t say and do that.	Tsy miteny sy manao toy izany ny olona.
In other words, you just look at them.	Amin'ny teny hafa, mijery azy ireo fotsiny ianao.
Hours and hours of time.	Ora sy ora ny fotoana.
that's enough for him.	ampy azy izany.
Not really an easy thing.	Tsy tena zavatra mora.
And he really did.	Ary tena nanao izany tokoa izy.
Not so now.	Tsy izany izao.
The journey was full of dangers.	Feno loza ny dia.
He’s really gone.	Tena lasa izy.
He saw her often.	Nahita azy matetika izy.
Thank you for joining.	Misaotra anao niditra.
For others, it takes more than that.	Ho an'ny hafa, mila mihoatra lavitra noho izany.
Don’t think you can get away with it.	Aza mieritreritra fa afaka miala amin'izany ianao.
It seems so.	Toa izany.
We talked a little.	Niresaka kely izahay.
You learn a lot of things.	Mianatra zavatra maro ianao.
I love reading.	Tiako ny mamaky.
That’s one of the cool things about it.	Izany no iray amin'ireo zavatra mahafinaritra momba izany.
So, paper is everything.	Noho izany, ny taratasy dia ny zava-drehetra.
Sounds crazy.	Toa adala.
Many people died.	Betsaka ny olona maty.
You have nothing to lose.	Tsy misy ho very ianao.
That is the way.	Izany no lalana.
She will make a beautiful baby.	Hanao zaza tsara tarehy izy.
No luck with that here.	Tsy misy vintana amin'izany eto.
I see that he is not.	Hitako fa tsy izy.
We need your honest opinion.	Mila ny hevitrao marina izahay.
Yes, not at all.	Eny, tsy izany mihitsy.
I have nothing about it now.	Tsy manana na inona na inona momba izany aho izao.
And it worked well and the others weren’t so good.	Ary niasa tsara izany ary ny hafa tsy dia tsara loatra.
For real.	Tena izy.

It’s a special place.	Toerana manokana azy io.
You are going to study.	Handeha hianatra ianao.
It is not known if this is true.	Tsy fantatra raha marina izany.

One knows them immediately.	Ny iray dia mahafantatra azy ireo avy hatrany.
I'm glad to see you too.	Faly koa aho mahita anao.
He has it now, he knows it.	Manana azy izy izao, fantany izany.
He wrote to us.	Nanoratra taminay izy.
Don’t think about it completely, in fact.	Aza mieritreritra azy tanteraka, raha ny marina.
And of course he was very interested.	Ary mazava ho azy fa tena liana izy.
I hope not.	Manantena aho fa tsy izany.
He really loves what he loves.	Tena tia ny zavatra tiany izy.
And he seemed very scared.	Ary toa natahotra be izy.
We had food, water.	Nanana sakafo izahay, rano.
Or we will go too.	Sa ho lasa koa isika.
He was the only one who saw the place.	Izy ihany no nahita ilay toerana.
I'm not ready to go.	Tsy vonona ny handeha aho.
He couldn't think straight in the end.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra tsara izy tamin'ny farany.
If you haven’t already done so, you need to do so.	Raha mbola tsy nanao izany ianao dia mila manao izany.
It’s not who you are and what you are.	Tsy hoe iza ianao ary inona ianao.
He is great.	Lehibe izy.
So they don’t know how you are.	Ka tsy fantany hoe manao ahoana ianao.
And, you know, he’s right.	Ary, fantatrao, marina izy.
People are still talking about it.	Mbola miresaka momba izany ny olona.
He wondered if he would ever come back to her again.	Nanontany tena izy raha mbola hiverina aminy indray izy.
One month and no more.	Iray volana ary tsy mihoatra.
So stay there.	Noho izany dia mijanona ao.
But right now, right now.	Fa amin'izao fotoana izao, amin'izao fotoana izao.
Went and left for the past two years.	Nandeha sy niala nandritra ny roa taona lasa.
Either way, the worse for them.	Na izany na tsy izany, ny ratsy kokoa ho azy ireo.
I want to meet him.	Te hihaona aminy aho.
Nothing more is known about him.	Tsy misy fantatra intsony momba azy.
Both are completely wrong.	Samy diso tanteraka.
So it must be true.	Ka tsy maintsy marina izany.
Did you sleep well?	Natory tsara ve ianao?
He asked me.	Nangataka ahy izy.
They will be new.	Ho vaovao izy ireo.
He absolutely loves you.	Tiany tanteraka ianao.
Better at the door.	Aleo amin'ny varavarana.
That’s the idea.	Ny hevitra izany.
The food is very good.	Tena tsara ny sakafo.
We hope this is not a big deal.	Manantena izahay fa tsy olana lehibe izany.
It’s work.	Asa izany.
But you are afraid of the light.	Fa ianao kosa matahotra ny mazava.
He had no music.	Tsy nanana mozika izy.
In the end everything went well.	Farany dia nety daholo ny zava-drehetra.
He is skilled.	Mahay izy.
But not for much longer.	Saingy tsy ela kokoa.
They sat talking.	Nipetraka niresaka izy ireo.
They keep coming.	Tonga hatrany izy ireo.
What went wrong?	Inona no tsy nety?
We just had to work to survive.	Tsy maintsy niasa fotsiny izahay mba ho velona.
I now know what it is.	Fantatro izao hoe inona izany.
Why would you want to do that?	Nahoana ianao no te hanao izany?
This is no longer possible.	Tsy azo atao intsony izany.
There was no reason at all.	Tsy nisy antony mihitsy.
A party took place.	Nisy fety nitranga.
Something real.	Zavatra tena izy.
They never did, of course, not in a big way.	Tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy ireo, mazava ho azy, tsy tamin'ny fomba lehibe.
This is very important.	Tena ilaina tokoa izany.
Yes, it’s fun.	Eny, mahafinaritra izany.
It always did what it wanted.	Nanao izay tiany foana izany.
I am not alive now.	Tsy velona aho izao.
He will go as fast as he can.	Handeha haingana araka izay azo atao izy.
You don’t do that either.	Tsy manao izany koa ianao.
The rain is coming from outside, and you can’t go home.	Avy any ivelany ny orana, ary tsy afaka mody ianao.
Then they can get what they want.	Avy eo dia afaka mahazo izay tiany izy ireo.
I thought you did too.	Nihevitra aho fa nanao izany koa ianao.
Because he was still a child.	Satria mbola zaza izy.
New money, of course.	Vola vaovao, mazava ho azy.
There is a lot to do here.	Betsaka ny azo atao eto.
He worked, worked, and worked harder.	Niasa izy, niasa, ary niasa bebe kokoa.
He could not do that.	Tsy afaka nanao izany izy.
However, he may be better off with all three than himself.	Na izany aza, mety ho tsara kokoa izy miaraka amin'ireo telo ireo noho ny tenany.
You are too early.	Efa aloha loatra ianao.
So we both tried.	Ka samy nanandrana izahay roa.
Don't do that.	Aza manao izany.
He could not sleep.	Tsy afaka natory izy.
I will know one day.	Ho fantatro indray andro any.
And I have a job.	Ary manana asa aho.
Then evil came.	Dia tonga ny ratsy.
The good and the bad.	Ny tsara sy ny ratsy.
I sat down and said it.	Nipetraka aho dia nilaza izany.
I want to tell you now.	Te hilaza aminao aho izao.
You know that.	Fantatrao izany.
We didn’t talk much.	Tsy dia niresaka firy izahay.
He sat up hard.	Nipetraka mafy izy.
A day or two maybe.	Iray na roa andro angamba.
Many people died.	Olona maro no maty.
It’s so easy.	Tena mora izany.
He hoped it would rain.	Nanantena izy fa hisy orana.
She was afraid to speak.	Natahotra niteny izy.
The first question is often the most difficult.	Matetika ny fanontaniana voalohany no sarotra indrindra.
He seemed to enjoy being with me.	Toa nahafinaritra azy ny niaraka tamiko.
I really had a good time.	Tena nanana fotoana tsara aho.
I have nothing to lose.	Tsy misy ho very aho.
I want to have a party.	Te hanao fety aho.
He finally did.	Nanao izany izy tamin’ny farany.
They’re pretty tough.	Somary mafy izy ireo.
They asked me some great questions.	Nanontany ahy fanontaniana lehibe izy ireo.
I made a mistake.	Nanao fahadisoana aho.
He has no reason.	Tsy manana antony izy.
He loves to do things.	Tia manao zavatra izy.
Have you said anything?	Efa nilaza zavatra ve ianao?
I really want him to be here.	Tena tiako ho eto izy.
But there seems to be a lot more to it than that.	Saingy toa mbola betsaka noho izany ny eto.
To do something.	Hanao zavatra.
I expected more.	Nanantena bebe kokoa aho.
They lived here for many years.	Nipetraka teto nandritra ny taona maro izy ireo.
There is still something to come.	Mbola misy zavatra ho avy.
You should go now.	Tokony handeha izao ianao.
Soon there will be no place for him.	Tsy ho ela dia tsy hisy toerana ho azy.
Just on the main road.	Eo amin'ny lalana lehibe ihany.
And he didn't even talk to me before.	Ary tsy niresaka tamiko akory izy aloha.
I was there when everything went.	Tao aho rehefa nandeha ny zava-drehetra.
Seeing the beautiful.	Mahita ny tsara tarehy.
No one came in or out.	Tsy nisy olona niditra na nivoaka.
Again, this is not true.	Tsy marina indray izany.
Because no one knows what to do with it.	Satria tsy misy mahalala izay tokony hatao amin'izany.
So he was there.	Ka teo izy.
I will stay here.	Eto aho hijanona.
Whatever it is will happen.	Na inona na inona izany dia hitranga.
Of course, there are many more.	Mazava ho azy fa mbola betsaka kokoa.
Different, but not better.	Hafa, fa tsy tsara kokoa.
He thought he knew it now.	Nihevitra izy fa fantany izany ankehitriny.
It's too late though.	Tara loatra na izany aza.
He was still waiting.	Mbola niandry ihany izy.
I never said that.	Tsy niteny toy izany mihitsy aho.
We should not do that.	Tokony tsy hanao izany isika.
There was a problem between the father and the son.	Nisy olana teo amin'ny ray sy ny zanany.
We can no longer do that.	Tsy afaka manao izany intsony isika.
Not to be high.	Tsy ho ambony.
It should be, but it’s not.	Tokony ho izany, fa tsy izany.
He didn't see me.	Tsy nahita ahy izy.
A lot has happened in the last few days.	Betsaka ny nitranga tao anatin’ny andro vitsivitsy.
And then there will be nothing.	Ary avy eo dia tsy hisy na inona na inona.

He didn't want to go.	Tsy te handeha izy.
I don’t think they are.	Heveriko fa tsy izy ireo.
But no one had it.	Nefa tsy nisy nanana azy.
In fact, it's not fair.	Raha ny marina dia tsy mety izany.
No one said a word.	Tsy nisy niteny na dia iray akory aza.
I was very happy to do so.	Tena faly aho nanao izany.
The food works.	Miasa ny sakafo.
Yes, we have more land now.	Eny, manana tany bebe kokoa isika ankehitriny.
I can't see you.	Tsy mahita anao aho.
I came here.	Tonga teto aho.
It is not known what kind of thing.	Tsy fantatra izay karazana zavatra.
I can't have.	Tsy afaka manana aho.
.	.
Always, no matter what.	Foana, na inona na inona.
They seem to do.	Toa manao izany izy ireo.
Same with music.	Mitovy amin'ny mozika.
We need it now.	Mila izany isika izao.
There is no one.	Tsy misy na iza na iza.
But it was too late.	Saingy tara loatra izany.
He had to get out of there.	Tsy maintsy niala teo izy.
The reason may be the following.	Ny antony dia mety ho ny manaraka.
Very good.	Tena tsara.
Everyone is doing it now.	Manao izany ny rehetra ankehitriny.
If you like these, fine.	Raha tianao ireo dia tsara.
That same afternoon.	Io tolakandro io ihany.
Who said something.	Izay nilaza zavatra.
I'm so happy for you.	Tena faly ho anao aho.
A little bit.	Kely kely.
That is, it is difficult.	Izany hoe sarotra izany.
Thirty years is a long time.	Telopolo taona dia fotoana lava.
I’m sure something went wrong there as well.	Azoko antoka fa nisy zavatra tsy nety teo koa.
You didn’t think so.	Tsy nieritreritra ianao.
What should be the highest.	Inona no tokony ho ambony indrindra.
You just grew up.	Vao lehibe ianao.
It’s not going to be pretty.	Tsy ho tsara tarehy izany.
Or it could be something else.	Na mety ho zavatra hafa izany.
They should arrive soon.	Tokony ho tonga tsy ho ela izy ireo.
He plays everything.	Izy no milalao ny zava-drehetra.
He can't either, but he wants to.	Tsy afaka koa izy, fa tiany.
He is busy.	Be atao izy.
Apparently not.	Toa tsy izany no izy.
It wasn’t very fun for him.	Tsy dia nahafinaritra azy loatra.
I don't know why it doesn't work.	Tsy haiko hoe maninona no tsy mandeha izany.
We just need to find him.	Mila mitady azy fotsiny isika.
About many things.	Momba ny zavatra maro.
Good for us.	Tsara ho antsika.
Of course, that will not happen.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy hitranga izany.
I will not give up on that.	Tsy hiala amin’izany aho.
Of course there is money.	Mazava ho azy fa misy vola.
Timing was flawless.	Tsy nisy tsiny ny fotoana.
He knew it.	Fantany izany.
This is not the real question.	Tsy io no tena fanontaniana.
So here’s the idea.	Ka izao no hevitra.
Then the story goes.	Dia mandeha ny tantara.
But only on paper.	Fa amin'ny taratasy ihany.
He always went.	Nandeha foana izy.
Which is certainly not often.	Izay azo antoka fa tsy matetika.
And then we went and did the movie.	Ary avy eo dia nandeha izahay ary nanao ny sarimihetsika.
Hard to find.	Sarotra ny nahita.
I try to do that.	Miezaka manao izany aho.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy izany.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Nihevitra aho fa nanao asa tsara tokoa izy tao.
This is the last possibility.	Io no mety farany.
Either way, it’s definitely not one of the three.	Na izany na tsy izany dia azo antoka fa tsy iray amin'ireo telo ireo.
Very good location.	Tena tsara toerana.
It’s not the same.	Tsy mitovy izany.
You don't get it.	Tsy azonao.
He played really well.	Tena nilalao tsara izy.
I don’t know that you have to have one.	Tsy fantatro fa tsy maintsy manana iray ianao.
Maybe there are too many of us.	Betsaka loatra angamba isika.
You just don’t have to.	Tsy manana fotsiny ianao.
No, it's human.	Tsia, olona io.
You have to leave.	Tsy maintsy miala ianao.
He is better than me.	Tsara kokoa noho izaho izy.
Not big, but powerful.	Tsy lehibe, fa mahery.
I looked at them too.	Nijery azy ireo koa aho.
If we wait, it will be too late.	Raha miandry isika dia ho tara loatra.
I will make you very happy.	Hataoko faly be ianao.
Of course he knew.	Mazava ho azy fa fantany.
Since last night.	Hatramin'ny omaly hariva.
I don’t understand why we do that.	Tsy azoko hoe nahoana isika no manao an'izany.
He is not stupid.	Tsy adala izy.
Even a little.	Na kely aza.
I love the new clothes!	Tiako ny akanjo vaovao!
It then becomes impossible.	Lasa tsy azo atao izany avy eo.
You will get a job again.	Hahazo asa indray ianao.
He is still happy.	Mbola faly izy.
You are not there yet.	Mbola tsy eo ianao.
It seems new.	Toa vaovao izany.
He alone did it.	Izy irery no nanao izany.
He really loves you.	Tena tia anao izy.
There was also no food.	Tsy nisy sakafo koa.
I looked at the house.	Nijery ny trano aho.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy.
Not the student’s closest friend.	Tsy hoe namana akaiky indrindra amin'ny mpianatra.
We were surprised.	Gaga izahay.
For two days.	Nandritra ny roa andro.
I must go.	Tsy maintsy mandeha aho.
No one did.	Tsy nisy nanao.
I was hoping it was raining.	Nanantena aho fa orana.
We’re just playing.	Milalao fotsiny izahay.
I'm looking for a friend.	mitady namana aho.
Really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra.
But it’s really hard.	Fa tena sarotra tokoa izany.
The road is long.	Lavitra ny lalana.
In fact, everything.	Raha ny marina, ny zava-drehetra.
They are one person.	Olona iray ihany izy ireo.
It helped me endlessly.	Nanampy ahy tsy nisy farany izany.
Or for both.	Na ho azy roa.
She knew he wouldn't say anything to her.	Fantany fa tsy hilaza na inona na inona aminy izy.
No, nothing tonight.	Tsia, tsy misy na inona na inona anio alina.
So that's where it sits.	Ka eo no mipetraka.
It’s really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra izany.
The house was different.	Hafa ny tao an-trano.
It’s like a movie to me.	Toy ny sarimihetsika izany amiko.
He didn’t talk much about you.	Tsy niresaka momba anao firy izy.
We need more.	Mila bebe kokoa izahay.
The time will come.	Ho avy ny fotoana.
They are just children.	Zaza ihany izy ireo.
It’s not too far away.	Tsy dia lavitra loatra izany.
It’s still a house, but more than that.	Mbola trano izy io, saingy mihoatra noho izany.
They may also be happy to be where they are.	Mety ho faly koa izy ireo eo amin’ny misy azy.
I like to talk about people.	Tiako ny hiresaka momba ny olona.
Can you tell me about this place.	Afaka milaza amiko momba ity toerana ity ve ianao.
There are many ways to do this.	Misy fomba maro hanaovana izany.
We never had much money.	Tsy nanana vola be mihitsy izahay.
The past is done.	Vita izay efa lasa.
Whether we need it or not, we have to buy it.	Na mila izany isika na tsia, dia tsy maintsy mividy izany isika.
Really love him.	Tena tia azy.
He just doesn’t know how much.	Tsy fantany fotsiny hoe ohatrinona.
There seemed to be no problem.	Toa tsy nisy olana teo.
He doesn't talk much.	Tsy dia miteny izy.
I hoped to be with him at all times.	Nanantena aho fa hiaraka aminy amin'ny fotoana rehetra.
I have to thank you for everything.	Tsy maintsy misaotra anao amin'ny zavatra rehetra aho.
I’m sure it cost more money.	Azoko antoka fa nandany vola kokoa izany.
You’re just wasting time.	Lasa very fotoana fotsiny ianao.
You didn't ask for it.	Tsy nangataka izany ianao.
No, he didn't.	Tsia, tsy nanao izany izy.
What today.	Inona ny anio.

I know how to know.	Haiko ny mahafantatra.
He refused to leave.	Tsy nety niala izy.
The only bad thing was he refused to speak.	Ny hany ratsy dia tsy nety niteny izy.
There was something unpleasant.	Nisy tsy mahafinaritra.
But I haven’t seen it yet.	Saingy mbola tsy nahita izany.
He has been dead for thirty years.	Efa maty nandritra ny telopolo taona.
I did not see.	Tsy nahita aho.
He is not suitable for the job.	Tsy izy no mety amin'ilay asa.
That was the first.	Izay no voalohany.

It could happen.	Mety hitranga.

But it seems more than that.	Saingy toa mihoatra noho izany izany.
He could have done it all.	Afaka nanao izany rehetra izany izy.
Maybe he’ll do more, or maybe he’ll do something else.	Angamba hanao bebe kokoa izy, na mety hanao zavatra hafa.
I never thought.	Tsy noheveriko mihitsy.
No one should do that.	Tsy misy tokony hanao toy izany.
He was very helpful and thoughtful.	Tena nanampy sy nieritreritra izy.
We came to see why.	Tonga izahay mba hijery ny antony.
At night we go swimming.	Amin'ny alina dia mandeha milomano.
Now, you want to be an actor.	Ankehitriny, te ho mpilalao sarimihetsika ianao.
I love the baby.	Tiako ilay zaza.

Hence the mistake.	Noho izany ny fahadisoana.
Everyone said so.	Samy nilaza izany ny rehetra.
And don’t make little kids.	Ary aza manao ankizy kely.
It doesn't matter if it is.	Tsy maninona raha izany.
The previous day was not there.	Tsy teo ny andro teo aloha.

But things seem different.	Saingy toa hafa ny zavatra.
It could have caused the accident.	Mety ho nahatonga ny loza izany.
Maybe, he went too far.	Angamba, lasa lavitra loatra izy.

But we can't.	Saingy tsy afaka izahay.
It’s much more than that.	Mbola mihoatra lavitra noho izany ihany.
It was a wonderful day.	Tena nahafinaritra ilay andro.
However, he kind of liked it.	Na izany aza, dia somary tiany izany.
He seems to like the problem for himself.	Toa tiany ho an'ny tenany ny olana.
Do they have money?	Manana vola ve izy ireo?

It's easy.	Mora izany.

The path should be different.	Tokony ho samy hafa ny lalana.
There was no help.	Tsy nisy fanampiana tamin’izany.

I love doing that.	Tiako ny nanao izany.
I recently did this and I love it.	Vao haingana aho no nahavita izany ary tiako izany.
You have never heard of it.	Mbola tsy nandre izany mihitsy ianao.
That is true.	Marina izany.
Everything else is still here.	Mbola eto daholo ny zavatra hafa rehetra.
We talked for a long time.	Niresaka lava be izahay.
He used to live upstairs.	Nipetraka tany ambony izy taloha.
This method is only possible.	Io fomba io ihany no mety.
And not at all.	Ary tsy izany mihitsy.
How old are you	Firy taona ianao?
It is not known what is best done.	Tsy fantatra hoe inona no atao indrindra.
He was fun.	Nahafinaritra izy.
And it takes a little while.	Ary mila fotoana kely izany.
But almost everyone is different.	Saingy saika ny olona rehetra dia samy hafa.
Maybe it should have started.	Angamba tokony ho nanomboka.
You think you can do anything !.	Mihevitra ianao fa afaka manao na inona na inona!.
Then wait two days.	Dia miandry roa andro.
Doing things right.	Manao zavatra araka ny tokony ho izy.
I'm afraid of him.	Matahotra azy aho.
He wanted the night.	Naniry ny alina izy.

Women earn more money than men.	Ny vehivavy dia mahazo vola be kokoa noho ny lehilahy.
, no.	, tsia.
We are glad you are here !.	Faly izahay fa eto ianao!.
They were really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra izy ireo.
Either way, you’ll go.	Na izany na tsy izany, handeha ianao.
No need to do wrong.	Tsy mila manao ratsy.
The day is busy.	Be atao ny andro.
I was even scared.	Natahotra mihitsy aza aho.
This story is hard to understand.	Sarotra azo io tantara io.
Not in his place.	Tsy amin'ny toerana misy azy.
Don't speak loudly.	Aza miteny mafy.
There is a reason.	Ao ny antony.
It may not be for you.	Mety tsy ho anao izany.
She is beautiful.	Tsara tarehy izy.
He never knew.	Tsy fantany mihitsy.
You should too.	Tokony koa ianao.
That sounds good.	Toa tsara izany.
Not that he needs it.	Tsy hoe mila izany izy.
I can't believe he's gone.	Tsy mino aho fa lasa izy.
Why don't you like him?	Nahoana no tsy tianao izy?
For me to do that must be bad.	Ho ahy ny manao izany dia tsy maintsy ho ratsy.
He hoped it didn't.	Nanantena izy fa tsy nisy izany.
It’s not something I like at all.	Tsy mba zavatra tiako mihitsy.
We should be the same.	Tokony ho toy izany koa isika.
It may be good, or not.	Mety tsara izany, na tsia.
It doesn't take many years for us to learn.	Tsy afaka taona maro isika vao mianatra.
He had called before.	Efa niantso aloha izy.
It may also have been in the past.	Mety ho teo aloha ihany koa izany.
Not too long ago.	Tsy ela izao.
It’s not like that.	Tsy toa azy izany.
He wants you to go home.	Tiany hody ianao.
There is nothing he does not know now.	Tsy misy zavatra tsy fantany ankehitriny.
It will be with others.	Hiaraka amin'ny hafa izany.
And the years will pass.	Ary ho lasa ny taona.
End of year.	Faran'ny taona.
I have already said that.	Efa nilaza izany aho.
These are two different ideas.	Hevitra roa samy hafa ireo.
I almost don’t know it anymore.	Saika tsy fantatro intsony izany ankehitriny.
He never went to her.	Tsy nankany aminy mihitsy izy.
I waited but he didn't come back.	Niandry aho fa tsy niverina izy.
We are all here and love you.	Eto izahay rehetra ary tia anao.
He doesn't like children.	Tsy tia ankizy izy.
And in the water.	Ary ao anaty rano.

So that's it.	Ka izay izany.
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
You know the weather is bad.	Fantatrao fa ratsy ny andro.
This is my favorite time of the day.	Ity no fotoana tiako indrindra amin'ny andro.
There are many more.	Mbola maro kokoa.
Whatever comes.	Na inona na inona tonga.
And it’s fun to watch, too.	Ary mahafinaritra ny mijery azy koa.
There’s something about it, as if it’s close.	Misy zavatra momba azy io, toy ny efa akaiky.
I don’t believe that’s enough.	Tsy mino aho fa ampy izany.
But that was because he didn’t have it.	Fa izany dia satria tsy nanana izy.
He seems to like it.	Toa tiany izany.
Yes, this method is more fun.	Eny, mahafinaritra kokoa ity fomba ity.
Water may help.	Mety hanampy ny rano.
Only you.	Ianao irery ihany.
I didn’t have time.	Tsy nanana fotoana aho.
They were up there.	Tany ambony teo izy ireo.
It's hard now.	Mafy izao.
I told the truth.	Nilaza ny marina aho.
I really don’t know why.	Tena tsy haiko ny antony.
And carry it.	Ary mitondra azy.
He pretended not to hear her.	Mody tsy nandre azy izy.
Some love.	Misy tia.
I read and time went by.	Namaky aho ary nandeha ny fotoana.

There was more now.	Nisy bebe kokoa izao.
It really came to me.	Tena tonga tamiko izany.

We have to do something, or we may lose everything.	Tsy maintsy manao zavatra isika, na mety ho very ny zava-drehetra.
We died then.	Efa maty tamin’izany isika.
They have no reason to do so.	Tsy manana antony hanaovana izany izy ireo.
Of course.	Mazava ho azy izany.
Sorry if it's a bit long.	Miala tsiny raha somary lava.
It was all fun.	Nahafinaritra ny rehetra.
He was almost ready.	Efa saika vonona izy.
It was in a place that had never been before.	Tany amin'ny toerana tsy mbola nisy izany.
You are wrong about me.	Diso ny momba ahy ianao.
You love that baby.	Tianao io zaza io.
Something else went wrong.	Nisy zavatra hafa tsy nety.
We talked and that’s what it was about.	Niresaka izahay ary izay no momba izany.
Nothing will be known.	Tsy hisy na inona na inona ho fantatra.
This is a big, big thing.	Ity dia zavatra lehibe, lehibe.
Tell them so, though.	Lazao azy ireo toy izany, na izany aza.
There was no food in the house.	Tsy nisy sakafo tao an-trano.
It was still there, just a short drive away.	Mbola teo ihany ilay izy, dia nandeha fiara kely fotsiny.
We need rain.	Mila ny orana isika.
You are still a child.	Mbola zaza ianao.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Fantatry ny rehetra fa ho eo izy.
Or two minutes.	Na roa minitra.

We never see faces.	Tsy mahita tarehy mihitsy izahay.
They will be easy.	Ho mora izy ireo.
They soon did.	Tsy ela dia nanao izany izy ireo.
I can sleep on the floor.	Afaka matory amin’ny tany aho.
I don't know what to do.	Tsy hitako izay hatao.
That must be the reason.	Tsy maintsy izany no antony.
He didn’t like it either.	Tsy tiany koa izany.
He thought for a moment before speaking.	Nieritreritra kely izy vao niteny.
This is a mistake.	Fahadisoana izany.
He didn’t start well.	Tsy nanomboka tsara izy.
I heard it myself.	Izaho mihitsy no nandre izany.
He is alive now.	Velona izy izao.
Bad stuff.	Zavatra ratsy.
The food there was better.	Tsara kokoa ny sakafo tany.
I thought it worked well at first.	Nihevitra aho fa niasa tsara izy io tamin'ny voalohany.

We got a job.	Nahazo asa izahay.
But if.	Fa raha.
And he did not come.	Ary tsy tonga izy.
So we try now.	Koa miezaka izahay izao.
And in fact, this is what works for me.	Ary raha ny marina, io no mety amiko.
I’ve come to that in the last three years.	Tonga tamin'izany aho tao anatin'ny telo taona farany.
Better late than never!	Aleo tara toy izay tsy misy!
You really should know that.	Tena tokony ho fantatrao izany.
I did like that.	Nataoko toa izany.
They seem very small.	Toa kely dia kely izy ireo.
You’re really crazy, aren’t you?	Tena adala ianao, sa tsy izany?
Right or wrong, one thing is for sure.	Na mety na tsy mety dia zavatra iray no azo antoka.
That is not enough.	Tsy ampy izany.

He could be as big as me.	Mety ho lehibe toa ahy izy.
It was as if he was the only one there.	Toy ny hoe izy irery ihany no misy.
Yes, it was nice to see you.	Eny, nahafinaritra ny nahita anao.

However, this is it.	Na izany aza, izany no izy.

He was wrong.	Diso hevitra izy.
Friends of the year.	Namana tamin'ny taona.

Then you.	Avy eo ianao.
The house is very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy ilay trano.
The house still exists today.	Mbola misy ny trano ankehitriny.
However, it can be far worse.	Na izany aza, mety ho ratsy lavitra izany.
I think you were wrong about everything.	Heveriko fa diso ianao tamin'ny zava-drehetra.
No one was killed.	Tsy nisy maty.
Now it’s gone.	Ankehitriny dia lasa izany.
No one came.	Tsy nisy tonga.
And maybe he's right.	Ary angamba marina ny azy.
Something is wrong here.	Misy zavatra tsy mety ka.
Nothing is too difficult.	Tsy misy zavatra sarotra loatra.
He had heard all this before.	Efa nandre izany rehetra izany izy taloha.
Because no one knows me.	Satria tsy misy mahalala ahy.
Or they might have had.	Na mety ho nanana .
I stayed with him.	Nijanona niaraka taminy aho.
Maybe that’s why he came back.	Angamba izany no nahatonga azy niverina.
That could be wrong.	Mety ho diso izany.
It may be good, it may not be.	Mety tsara izany, mety tsy mety.
It seems misplaced.	Toa diso toerana.
If not, do something else.	Raha tsy izany dia manao zavatra hafa.
And nothing is safer.	Ary tsy misy azo antoka kokoa.
I love watching it.	Tiako ny mijery azy.

To go home, that is.	Ny hody, izany hoe.
The water was beautiful!	Nahafinaritra ilay rano!

There is a party.	Misy fety.
I will never make that mistake again.	Tsy hanao izany fahadisoana izany intsony aho.

It's different.	Hafa izany.
One who looks at me.	Iray izay mijery ahy.
Sorry for the mistake.	Miala tsiny amin'ny fahadisoana.

Of course he will.	Mazava ho azy fa hanao izany izy.
That sounds bad.	Toa ratsy ary izany.
It's a good day.	Tsara ny andro.
He was still scared.	Mbola natahotra ihany izy.
Even without them, it would have been silly.	Na dia tsy nisy azy ireo aza dia mety ho adala izany.
It's just me.	Izaho ihany izany.
We enjoyed being in this house.	Nahafinaritra anay ny tao amin'ity trano ity.
It just doesn’t seem like it to you.	Toa tsy mitovy amin'ny anao fotsiny izany.

And, that’s not a question.	Ary, tsy fanontaniana izany.
I just looked at him.	Nijery azy fotsiny aho.
He knows everything he needs to know.	Fantany ny zavatra rehetra tokony ho fantany.
Night is a wonderful time of day.	Ny alina dia fotoana mahafinaritra amin'ny andro.
I felt like a child again.	Nahatsiaro ho toy ny zaza indray aho.

Very powerful indeed.	Tena mahery tokoa.
Don’t go too far.	Aza atao lavitra.
You can’t go wrong when you do that.	Tsy mety diso ianao rehefa manao izany.

I really don’t believe it.	Tena tsy mino aho.
The old woman was very angry.	Tezitra be ilay vehivavy be taona.
I don't know where they are.	Tsy fantatro hoe taiza izy ireo.
I know that's not right.	Fantatro fa tsy mety izany.
He was just such a man.	Lehilahy toy izany ihany izy.
Even if he likes it.	Na dia tiany aza.
I read this book once.	Namaky ity boky ity aho indray mandeha.
It doesn't fit well.	Tsy mety tsara izany.
What is unclear is why.	Ny tsy mazava dia ny antony.
Which is impossible.	Izay tsy azo atao.

Of course, he was very sick.	Mazava ho azy fa tena narary mafy izy.
So kind of.	Ka karazana.
He had a chance.	Nanana fahafahana izy.
It is very difficult to find good teachers today.	Tena sarotra ankehitriny ny mahita mpampianatra mahay.
I don’t really know that.	Tsy fantatro tanteraka izany.

You seem to need me.	Toa nila ahy ianao.
I had a chance to ask him once.	Nahazo fahafahana nanontany azy aho indray mandeha.
I did not read the book.	Tsy namaky ilay boky aho.
No one said anything else.	Tsy mbola nisy niteny hafa mihitsy.
Went at night.	Nandeha tamin'ny alina.
I don’t remember much about him.	Tsy tadidiko firy ny momba azy.

The first is location.	Ny voalohany dia ny toerana.
But it won't last long.	Fa tsy ho ela velona.

Although there were problems, the work was not done well.	Na dia nisy olana aza dia tsy vita tsara ny asa.
The idea.	Ny hevitra .
It doesn't matter now.	Tsy maninona izany ankehitriny.
I have to leave now.	Tsy maintsy miala aho izao.
You may have seen something like this.	Mety efa nahita toy izany ianao.
He needed help.	Nila fanampiana izy.
Maybe too much.	Be loatra angamba.
All of you, you are all the same.	Ianareo rehetra, mitovy ianareo rehetra.
He watched the movie carefully.	Nijery tsara ilay sarimihetsika izy.
I will do it again.	Mbola hataoko indray.
Closer, and even closer.	Akaiky kokoa, ary mbola akaiky kokoa.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
I'm sure he'll live long.	Azoko antoka fa ho ela velona izy.
However.	Na dia izany aza.
I know nothing.	tsy mahalala na inona na inona aho.
How about you?	Ahoana ny hevitrao?
And he loved her.	Ary tiany izy.
These are the best.	Ireo no tsara indrindra.
We would be better off without it.	Ho tsara kokoa isika raha tsy misy izany.
No one saw or heard him for two days.	Tsy nisy nahita azy na nandre azy tao anatin’ny roa andro.
I am very angry.	Tezitra be aho.
This is indeed true.	Marina tokoa izany.
It really didn’t work out for him.	Tena tsy nety taminy izany.
Of course, it could not be eaten either.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka nihinana koa ilay izy.
I need to get out of here.	Mila miala eto aho.

He doesn't agree with most people.	Tsy mitovy hevitra amin’ny olona maro izy.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra izany.
I doubt it will happen.	Misalasala aho fa hitranga izany.
Not that he would say that.	Tsy hoe hilaza izany izy.
He was not afraid.	Tsy natahotra izy.
Absolutely not his.	Tena tsy azy.
That sounds very difficult, doesn’t it?	Toa sarotra be izany, sa tsy izany?
It was a great opportunity for him.	Vintana mafy ho azy izany.
We will go.	Handeha izahay.
He saw danger.	Nahita loza izy.
I will be more prepared.	Ho vonona kokoa aho.
And it really does exist.	Ary tena misy tokoa izany.
There was too much.	Be loatra ny tao.
So why even question.	Dia maninona aza no fanontaniana.
But that is not at all.	Saingy tsy izany mihitsy no izy.
He knows nothing.	Tsy mahalala na inona na inona izy.
This work must be completed tomorrow.	Tsy maintsy vita rahampitso io asa io.
Men doing the work.	Lehilahy manao ny asa.
Something happened.	Zavatra nitranga.
I spoke to him again today.	Niresaka taminy indray aho androany.
You should be able to read one from the other.	Tokony ho afaka mamaky ny iray avy amin'ny iray hafa ianao.
These problems are small.	Kely ihany ireo olana ireo.
But it seems hard to do.	Saingy toa sarotra ny manao izany.
He always did.	Nanao izany foana izy.
No one tried to talk to him about it.	Tsy nisy nanandrana niresaka taminy momba izany.
I am going to school.	Mandeha mianatra aho.
During good times and bad.	Nandritra ny fotoana tsara sy ny ratsy.
It's a dog.	Tena alika.
It is not clear why.	Tsy fantatra mazava hoe nahoana.
We are no different.	Tsy misy hafa amin’ny hafa isika.
And yet, for me, he has always been my favorite.	Ary na izany aza, ho ahy dia izy foana no tiako indrindra.
This is also wrong.	Diso koa izany.
But first.	Fa aloha.
These times need more.	Mila betsaka kokoa ireo fotoana ireo.
This is good.	Tsara ity.
My favorite.	Ny tiako indrindra.
It was very much like a movie.	Tena toy ny sarimihetsika mihitsy ilay izy.
The former himself.	Ny tenany taloha.
He was about to lose his mind.	Saika ho very hevitra izy.
Others leave when full.	Ny hafa dia miala rehefa feno.
I don't need it this morning.	Tsy mila izany aho izao maraina izao.
I don’t want to be difficult.	Tsy te ho sarotra aho.
And he slept there.	Dia natory tao izy.
That is the only reason.	Izay ihany no antony.
He did not call anyone in particular.	Tsy niantso olona manokana izy.
I can't.	Tsy afaka aho.
We were almost always together.	Saika niaraka foana izahay.
There are many types that do this.	Betsaka ny karazana manao izany.
He couldn't think of that.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra an’izany izy.
That’s one thing.	Zavatra iray izany.
The man did not look that way.	Tsy nijery an’io lalana io ilay lehilahy.
Or before.	Na taloha.
One of the many problems.	Iray amin'ireo olana maro.
He himself told me that.	Izy mihitsy no nilaza izany tamiko.
And it was really fun.	Ary tena nahafinaritra tokoa izany.
Long time no see.	Ela ary.
Indeed, it could not be any different.	Eny tokoa, tsy mety ho hafa izany.
I have never seen anything like it.	Mbola tsy nahita tahaka an'izany mihitsy aho.
All fools, evil.	Ny adala rehetra, ny ratsy.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy.
Other ideas are not necessarily true.	Ny hevitra hafa dia tsy voatery ho marina.
They are really big.	Tena lehibe izy ireo.
Then it all happened at once.	Dia nitranga indray mandeha ny zava-drehetra.
Time passed for him, he knew it.	Nandeha ny fotoana ho azy, fantany izany.
I recently finished the first one.	Vao haingana aho no nahavita ny voalohany.
They will talk about it for years to come.	Mbola hiresaka momba izany izy ireo mandritra ny taona maro ho avy.
He wanted to do more than that.	Te hanao mihoatra noho izany izy.
The girl studied well.	Nianatra tsara ilay tovovavy.
But there is no way that can be true.	Saingy tsy misy fomba mety ho marina izany.
Of.	An'ny.
Not that day.	Tsy io andro io.
So you can follow this news.	Noho izany dia azonao atao ny manaraka ireo vaovao ireo.
He should have thought more about it.	Tokony ho nieritreritra bebe kokoa momba izany izy.
I still have other work to do.	Mbola misy asa hafa hataoko.
And it should be.	Ary tokony ho izany.
But it looks like it will be a long time.	Saingy toa mbola ho ela izy.
And he went out.	Dia nivoaka izy.
He always does.	Manao toy izany foana izy.
We get nothing.	Tsy mahazo na inona na inona izahay.
So you can't go wrong.	Ka tsy mety diso ianao.
Here is the story.	Ity ny tantara.
Thank you again.	Misaotra anao indray.
Yes, they bought the house, actually bought it.	Eny, nividy ilay trano izy ireo, tena nividy azy.
They will feed them.	Izy ireo no hanome sakafo azy ireo.
This year has to be completely different.	Tsy maintsy hafa mihitsy ity taona ity.
Both were really fun.	Nahafinaritra tokoa ireo roa ireo.
Not the moon, but the moon.	Tsy ny volana, fa ny iray volana.
You can come here.	Afaka tonga eto ianao.
He knew it would be difficult for him to do so.	Fantany fa ho sarotra aminy ny hanao izany.
But the money has to come from somewhere.	Fa ny vola dia tsy maintsy avy any ho any.
Both are necessary.	Samy ilaina.
Not a party.	Tsy fety.
Almost all of us.	Saika isika rehetra.
We need help with that.	Mila fanampiana amin'izany.
These are the things he knows.	Ireo no zavatra fantany.
He had never felt so strong.	Mbola tsy nahatsiaro tena mahery toy izany izy.
They are really hard.	Tena sarotra tokoa izy ireo.
I wrote to him.	Nanoratra taminy aho.
That is, if you really want to go home.	Izany hoe raha tena te hody ianao.
It seems so too.	Toa izany koa.
He had to get out.	Tsy maintsy nivoaka izy.
I had to sit there and wait.	Tsy maintsy nipetraka teo aho ary niandry.
Far from here.	Lavitra eto.
I know, because they were there too.	Fantatro, satria teo koa izy ireo.
Of course, that's not good.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy tsara izany.
You are here now.	Eto ianao izao.
On a bad day, stay home.	Amin'ny andro ratsy, mijanona ao an-trano.
The food was delicious!	Nahafinaritra ny sakafo!
I can't tell you now.	Tsy afaka milaza aminao aho izao.
There is breakfast, but no other meals.	Misy sakafo maraina, fa tsy misy sakafo hafa.
It just isn’t an easy task.	Izany fotsiny dia tsy asa mora.
We have work to do.	Manana asa hatao izahay.
They talked a little.	Niresaka kely izy ireo.
I think he knows something.	Heveriko fa mahafantatra zavatra izy.
It will not be easy.	Tsy ho mora izany.
There are too many problems.	Be loatra ny olana.
We see nothing.	Tsy mahita na inona na inona izahay.
Enough of what has already happened.	Ampy izay izay efa nitranga.
I don't know if that's right for you.	Tsy fantatro raha mety aminao izany.
And it’s really hard to do that.	Ary tena sarotra ny manao izany.
Even from himself.	Na avy amin'ny tenany aza.
I went and did the same thing again.	Nandeha aho ary nanao izany zavatra izany indray.
I would love to see more of this !.	Tiako ny hahita bebe kokoa amin'ity!.
You need to have two.	Mila manana roa ianao.
It was real.	Tena nisy ihany ilay izy.
Whether it worked for them or not.	Raha niasa ho azy ireo izany na tsia.
He made the right decision.	Nanapa-kevitra marina izy.
So no problem there.	Ka tsy misy olana any.
I had to finish it and it came out last.	Tsy maintsy vitako ilay izy ary nivoaka farany.
Will definitely be back.	Tena hiverina.
To me, especially.	Amiko, indrindra.
But that is what happened.	Fa izany no nitranga.
He just wanted to talk.	Te hiresaka fotsiny izy.
A car was parked outside.	Nisy fiara nijanona teo ivelany.
He could not be ready for it.	Tsy nety ho vonona ho azy izy.
They will not go very far either.	Tsy ho lasa lavitra koa izy ireo.
It should be for you.	Tokony ho anao izany.
Aren't they like that.	Tsy toy izany ve ireo.
There was nothing there.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona tao.
I will live again.	Ho velona indray aho.
He still wanted to know where it came from.	Mbola tiany ho fantatra hoe avy aiza ilay izy.
I'm just here.	Izaho vao teto.
It is early in the morning, so there is still time.	Vao maraina izao, ka mbola misy ny fotoana.
John was surprised.	Gaga i John.
Little did he know he would do it.	Tsy fantany fa hanao izany izy.
However, he wanted more.	Na izany aza, dia naniry bebe kokoa izy.
I will give you money.	Hanome anao vola aho.
I have never seen them so scared.	Tsy mbola nahita azy ireo natahotra toy izany.
He didn’t just live here.	Tsy nipetraka teto fotsiny izy.
And one and the other told the truth.	Ary nilaza ny marina ny iray sy ny iray.
Thank you so much for such a nice word.	Misaotra indrindra tamin'ny teny mahafinaritra toy izany.
He wouldn’t love me, of course.	Tsy ho tia ahy izy, mazava ho azy.
The latter, in particular.	Ity farany, indrindra indrindra.
I will do it.	Hataoko izany.
More than that.	Mihoatra noho izany.
He knows these paths well.	Fantany tsara ireo lalana ireo.
Time passed quickly.	Nandeha haingana ny fotoana.
I want to see him become the best he can be.	Tiako ny hahita azy ho tonga tsara indrindra araka izay azo atao.
He decided to say it.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hilaza izany izy.
Something else happened.	Nisy zavatra hafa nitranga.
Something bad is going to happen.	Hisy zavatra ratsy hitranga.
I don't know what to do!	Tsy hitako izay hatao!
We’re not just going to get out of here.	Tsy hivoaka eto fotsiny izahay.
It really did exist.	Tena nisy tokoa izany.
It’s not easy to find something you like.	Tsy mora ny mahita zavatra tianao.
You can do more than that.	Afaka manao mihoatra noho izany ianao.
I think that’s fun.	Heveriko fa mahafinaritra izany.
People are sleeping.	Matory ny olona.
Bad idea, hopefully they won’t do it in the end.	Hevitra ratsy, manantena fa tsy hanao izany izy ireo amin'ny farany.
He alone.	Izy irery ihany.
We’re happy to wear little clothes.	Faly izahay manao akanjo kely.
There is no help for him.	Tsy misy fanampiana ho azy.
This is for us.	Aminay ity.
However, this is not necessarily the case.	Na izany aza, tsy voatery ho izany.
This is where it should be.	Ity no toerana tokony hisy azy.
He is always full of good ideas.	Feno hevitra tsara foana izy.
These things are just fun.	Mahafinaritra fotsiny ireo zavatra ireo.
He will become a friend in the future.	Ho lasa namana ho avy izy.
It's gone.	Lasa io.
But you are on the last chance.	Saingy eo amin'ny vintana farany ianao.
We went out.	Nivoaka izahay.
There are three types here.	Karazana telo eto.
He still lives there.	Mbola mipetraka any izy.
Maybe we'll stay here for a few days.	Angamba hijanona eto andro vitsivitsy isika.
There he had it all the way he could.	Teo izy dia nanana ny lalana rehetra azony.
He doesn't seem right to me.	Toa tsy mety amiko izy.
I'm scared.	Matahotra aho.
He's just in another room.	Ao amin'ny efitrano hafa fotsiny izy.
They have many.	Manana maro izy ireo.
In fact, it is okay to do so.	Raha ny marina dia mety ny manao izany.
Then they went to sleep.	Dia nandeha natory izy ireo.
I saw him.	Hitako izy.
The question arises as to whether this is indeed the case.	Mipetraka ny fanontaniana raha izany tokoa no izy.
Of course, this is a mistake.	Mazava ho azy fa fahadisoana izany.
It doesn't seem to work.	Toa tsy mandeha izany.
The end has not yet come.	Tsy mbola tonga ny farany.
These students often arrive late.	Matetika tara vao tonga ireo mpianatra ireo.
I don't understand how.	Tsy azoko hoe ahoana.
Maybe he didn’t like it.	Angamba tsy tiany izany.
He was right.	Marina ny nataony.
And very easy to do.	Ary tena mora atao.
I usually do it better now.	Matetika aho izao no manao toy izany tsara kokoa.
For this reason, we just ignore them.	Noho izany antony izany dia tsy miraharaha azy ireo fotsiny isika.
He is hers.	Azy izy.
She is never pretty.	Tsy tsara tarehy mihitsy izy.
It’s all very good.	Tena tsara daholo izany.
There is no right or wrong way.	Tsy misy fomba mety na tsy mety.
I tried to do something like this.	Nanandrana nanao zavatra toy izao aho.
It’s so close.	Tena akaiky tokoa izany.
This dog needs a good home.	Mila trano tsara io alika io.
And so, it’s crazy.	Ary noho izany, dia adala.
However, he stayed put.	Na izany aza, dia nijanona ihany izy.
We bought two.	Nividy roa izahay.
He had not yet begun to speak.	Tsy mbola nanomboka niteny izy.
It’s a big job.	Asa lehibe izany.

Now, he had to admit, he got it.	Ankehitriny, tsy maintsy niaiky izy, azony izany.
He was very scared.	Tena natahotra izy.
Men and women are very different.	Tena samy hafa ny lehilahy sy ny vehivavy.
He is not here.	Tsy eto izy.
I know that is true.	Fantatro fa marina izany.
He always did that.	Nanao toy izany hatrany izy.
There was no place for me.	Tsy nisy toerana ho ahy.
There are days like that.	Misy andro toy izany.
But for whatever reason, we were there.	Fa na inona na inona antony, teo izahay.
He knew for a long time that this would happen.	Efa ela no fantany fa hitranga izany.
They are not things.	Tsy zavatra izy ireo.
And he has done it.	Ary efa nataony izany.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra tokoa izany.
He needs to work on the final issue.	Mila miasa amin'ny olana farany izy.
But especially today.	Fa indrindra androany.
I really thought about it.	Tena nieritreritra an'izany aho.
He wants you to go home.	Tiany hody ianao.
I'm glad to be here.	Faly aho tonga eto.
He always talked and talked.	Niresaka sy niresaka foana izy.
Very good job.	Asa tena tsara.
This is indeed true.	Marina tokoa izany.
It has to be a woman.	Tsy maintsy vehivavy izany.
I have to get rid of those clothes.	Tsy maintsy miala amin'ireo akanjo ireo aho.
It can be done year-round, both indoors and outdoors.	Azo atao mandritra ny taona, na ao an-trano na any ivelany.
He seems confused.	Toa very hevitra izy.
The man was angry.	Tezitra ny lehilahy.
There are many more!	Mbola misy maro hafa koa!
We really are.	Tena isika mihitsy.
He can't see.	Tsy mahita izy.
Apparently not.	Toa tsy izany.
That's right.	Izany tokoa.
I need to see you.	Mila mahita anao aho.
I asked for it.	Nangataka izany aho.
This is not an easy thing to understand.	Zavatra tsy mora azo izany.
Now, the idea is this.	Izao, ny hevitra dia izao.
That’s a lot.	Be dia be izany.
I kind of wished it wasn’t there.	Somary naniry aho fa tsy nisy izany.
And it’s not wrong to be different.	Ary tsy diso ny hoe tsy mitovy.
Thank you for that.	Misaotra ahy noho izany ianao.
He was ready to go by that time.	Efa vonona ny handeha izy nandritra io fotoana io.
There were no questions, of course.	Tsy nisy fanontaniana, mazava ho azy.
Not everyone is good.	Tsy ny rehetra no tsara.
It is very special.	Dia tena manokana manokana.
He must have known that they were there.	Tsy maintsy fantany fa any izy ireo.
I did it.	Nahavita izany aho.
I can’t say anything good about them.	Tsy afaka milaza zavatra tsara momba azy ireo aho.
I know too much.	fantatro loatra.
He is not busy.	Tsy sahirana izy.
It's just mine.	Ny ahy ihany io.
He knew what awaited him.	Fantany izay niandry azy.
I can’t do everything today or even this week.	Tsy afaka manao ny zava-drehetra aho anio na amin'ity herinandro ity aza.
Or from himself.	Na avy amin'ny tenany.
The same is true of men.	Toy izany koa ny lehilahy.
Together we will overcome them.	Hiaraka handresy azy ireo isika.
He walked again.	Nandeha indray izy.
It’s not perfect.	Tsy tanteraka izany.
They went hard.	Nandeha mafy izy ireo.
I wanted to do that.	Naniry ny hanao izany aho.
This is not entirely true.	Tsy marina tanteraka izany.
And you can.	Ary azonao atao.
They are very happy.	Tena faly izy ireo.
For us, it was different.	Ho anay dia hafa izany.
We left the house.	Nivoaka ny trano izahay.
That's it there.	Izany no azy any.
And happy with that.	Ary faly amin'izany.
No, you should go.	Tsia, tokony handeha ianao.
He almost liked her.	Saika tiany izy.
And it never stopped.	Ary tsy nijanona mihitsy izany.
If you had an idea.	Raha nanana hevitra ianao.
A bad time.	Fotoana ratsy iray.
That idea is not yours.	Tsy anao io hevitra io.
Yes, for many years, there may never have been.	Eny, nandritra ny taona maro, mety tsy hisy mihitsy.
It was fun to see him.	Nahafinaritra ny nahita azy.
He is not allowed to go there.	Tsy mahazo mandeha any izy.
A working person who just earns, if so.	Olona miasa izay mahazo fotsiny, raha izany.
More than that.	Mihoatra noho izany.
But neither is he.	Saingy tsy izany koa izy.
And very hard as he is.	Ary tena mafy toa azy.
But don't worry.	Fa aza manahy.
Which was not there.	Izay tsy teo.
At first it went over the summer.	Tamin'ny voalohany dia nandeha nandritra ny fahavaratra.
They did not see him.	Tsy nahita azy izy ireo.
I think it should be like that.	Heveriko fa tokony ho toy izany.
I must go.	Tsy maintsy mandeha aho.
A few years, maybe more.	Taona vitsivitsy, angamba mihoatra.
But, he needed to try something, no matter what.	Saingy, nila nanandrana zavatra izy, na inona na inona.
It’s even worse.	Ratsy kokoa izany.
Not a good place.	Tsy toerana tsara.
I have a lot of questions about it.	Manana fanontaniana be dia be momba izany aho.
We need to look at the bigger picture.	Mila mijery ny sary lehibe kokoa isika.
We are stronger than that.	Mahery noho izany isika.
Perhaps he hoped to do the same.	Angamba izy nanantena hanao toy izany koa.
He said no one was in the house.	Nilaza izy fa tsy nisy olona tao an-trano.
You can’t just do two.	Tsy afaka manao roa fotsiny ianao.
This is an old problem.	Olana taloha izany.
These are two completely different jobs.	Asa roa samy hafa tanteraka ireo.
This is also wrong.	Diso koa izany.
He could no longer walk.	Tsy afaka nandeha intsony izy.
This is a bad job.	Asa ratsy izany.
I wanted to.	Naniry aho.
He did nothing more.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona intsony izy.
And you already had it.	Ary efa nanana azy ianao.
How was the past?	Nanao ahoana ny teo aloha?
When he tried anything.	Rehefa nanandrana na inona na inona izy.
I will go out.	Hivoaka aho.
Good to wait.	Tsara ny miandry.
I don't mind that.	Tsy maninona aho izany.
If not, wait another day.	Raha tsy izany dia miandry andro hafa.
I enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra ahy izany.
He came back again.	Niverina indray izy.
That can be a very useful thing.	Mety ho zavatra tena ilaina tokoa izany.
I have a wonderful friend.	Manana namana mahafinaritra aho.
So, don’t do that.	Noho izany, aza manao izany.
Eventually they left.	Farany dia lasa izy ireo.
Do your best work with people you know.	Manao asa tsara indrindra amin'ny olona fantatrao.
He finally stopped.	Nijanona ihany izy tamin’ny farany.
Tell who saw the news.	Lazao hoe iza no nahita ny vaovao.
They blamed people they knew.	Nanome tsiny ny olona fantany izy ireo.
No, not very close, but crazy.	Tsia, tsy tena akaiky, fa adala.
Something happened outside.	Nisy zavatra nitranga tany ivelany.
Three months of the year is best.	Telo volana amin'ny taona no tsara indrindra.
He was busy, anyway.	Sahirana izy, na ahoana na ahoana.
To do something is to do nothing.	Ny manao zavatra dia tsy manao na inona na inona.
I enjoyed the work.	Nahafinaritra ahy ilay asa.
And he is better than good.	Ary tsara noho ny tsara izy.
So, it’s no longer here.	Noho izany, tsy misy izany intsony eto.
I need to go see him.	Mila mandeha mijery azy aho.
Maybe he doesn’t act like you.	Angamba tsy manao toa anao izy.
We're having a party!	Manao fety izahay!
They said we could only talk to him in the morning.	Nilaza izy ireo fa afaka miresaka aminy fotsiny izahay ny maraina.
It was almost out.	Efa saika nivoaka ilay izy.
We need someone like him.	Mila olona toa azy izahay.
One day it rained a lot.	Indray andro dia nisy orana be.
Just like anywhere else, once you’re gone, you’re gone.	Tahaka ny any amin'ny toerana hafa, raha vao lasa ianao dia lasa.
He was also very good at it.	Tena nahay tamin'izany koa izy.
They were afraid of us too.	Natahotra antsika koa izy ireo.
He was always happy to help.	Faly nanampy foana izy.
She likes to watch him sleep.	Tiany ny mijery azy matory.
It has to be beautiful.	Tokony ho tsara tarehy.
A lot of people work from home these days.	Betsaka ny olona miasa ao an-trano amin'izao andro izao.
It gave me that.	Nanome ahy izany.
Then I, of course.	Avy eo aho, mazava ho azy.
Whatever they are.	Na inona na inona izy ireo.
Now that’s like one or two.	Ankehitriny dia toy ny iray na roa izany.
However, such an approach is very difficult.	Na izany aza, ny fomba toy izany dia tena sarotra.
Who is the smartest person in the room?	Iza no olona mahay indrindra ao amin'ny efitrano?
Yours may be different.	Mety ho hafa ny anao.

But even those who are still waiting.	Fa na ireo mbola miandry.
But let’s be real.	Fa aleo ho tena izy.
Food for one.	Ny sakafo ho an'ny iray.

These are all issues right now.	Ireo no olana rehetra amin'izao fotoana izao.
It can go in many ways.	Mety handeha amin'ny fomba maro izany.
That’s right, another one.	Marina izany, iray hafa.
He is no longer a child.	Tsy zaza intsony izy.
And that’s a lot.	Ary be dia be izany.
The house found a better day.	Nahita andro tsara kokoa ilay trano.
Not far from the house.	Tsy lavitra ny trano.
He is very lonely.	Tena irery izy.
The other one is me.	Ny iray hafa dia izaho.
Not three minutes, but three days.	Tsy telo minitra, fa telo andro.
That's what happened to me.	Izany no nitranga tamiko.
No need.	Tsy mila.
I will be there.	Ho avy eo aho.
He couldn't think straight.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra tsara izy.

Coming here.	Ho avy eto.
I looked at another and another.	Nijery iray hafa aho ary iray hafa.
And it’s not easy.	Ary tsy mora izany.
But in fact they are two different things.	Saingy raha ny marina dia zavatra roa samy hafa izy ireo.
Everything is ready.	Efa vonona ny zava-drehetra.
The idea is not what but how.	Ny hevitra dia tsy hoe inona fa ahoana.

I really didn’t try to overcome it.	Tena tsy niezaka ny handresy an'io aho.
I really like the movie.	Tena tiako ilay sarimihetsika.

You will help me now.	Ianao izao no hanampy ahy.
It's been a long time.	Efa ela izay.
I hope they are right.	Manantena aho fa marina izy ireo.
Everyone did wrong.	Nanao ratsy ny rehetra.
I thought he was talking about me, but he wasn’t.	Nihevitra aho fa niresaka momba ahy izy, saingy tsy izany.
We will be ready for it.	Ho vonona ho azy isika.
I will not be these things.	Tsy ho ireo zavatra ireo aho.
If anyone can, it’s you.	Raha misy afaka, dia ianao.
It’s not too much.	Tsy dia betsaka loatra izany.
They said many people died.	Nilaza izy ireo fa maro ny olona maty.

We have what it takes to be the best.	Manana izay ilaina mba ho tsara indrindra isika.

So you might as well stay home.	Koa mety hijanona ao an-trano ihany koa ianao.
Or something completely different.	Na zavatra hafa tanteraka.

Very, very little.	Tena kely dia kely.
They were once.	Indray mandeha izy ireo.

We used to disagree.	Tsy mitovy hevitra izahay taloha.
The weather is still a bit bad.	Mbola somary ratsy ihany ny andro.
You don’t know.	Tsy mahafantatra ianao.

They could see him.	Afaka nahita azy izy ireo.
Don’t hesitate.	Aza misalasala.
There is another story about this story.	Misy tantara hafa momba ity tantara ity.
My guess is the following.	Ny heveriko dia izao manaraka izao.
They really thought they could.	Tena nihevitra izy ireo fa mety ho izy ireo.
He looks at me.	Mijery ahy izy.
He looked at the others.	Nijery ny hafa izy.
He didn’t like that word.	Tsy tiany io teny io.
Don't sleep.	Aza matory.
Really alive.	Tena velona tokoa.
I worked for a week.	Niasa nandritra ny herinandro aho.
He did not do the same.	Tsy nanao toy izany koa.
But not just work.	Fa tsy asa fotsiny.
That's how it should be.	Izany no tokony ho izy.
That’s the best thing.	Izany no zavatra tsara indrindra.
I see no reason to do that.	Tsy hitako izay antony hanaovana izany.
Just there.	Teo ihany.
For more than one reason as well.	Noho ny antony mihoatra ny iray ihany koa.
No one really wants to do that.	Tsy misy olona tena te hanao izany.
I’m not like that often.	Tsy toy izany aho matetika.
At a time like this as well.	Amin'ny fotoana tahaka izao koa.
Someone else decided it.	Olona hafa no nanapa-kevitra izany.
I want her to be happy.	Tiako ho faly izy.
But that is not enough for us.	Saingy tsy ampy ho antsika izany.
I met other women.	Nihaona tamin'ny vehivavy hafa aho.
It is not difficult.	Tsy sarotra izany.
He didn't even say that.	Tsy nilaza izany akory.
I was sick for three days.	Narary telo andro aho.
That's enough first.	Ampy izay aloha.
We arrived a little early to talk.	Tonga aloha kely izahay mba hiresaka.
Not many people entered his room.	Tsy nisy olona firy niditra tao amin'ny efitranony.
I was never wrong.	Tsy diso mihitsy aho.
I like the old clothes.	Tiako ny akanjo misy lasa.
Which is good.	Izay tsara.
About many things.	Momba ny zavatra maro.
And he will take you home.	Ary hitondra anao hody izy.
And a lot of kids love doing it.	Ary maro ny ankizy tia manao izany.
Certainly there are questions.	Azo antoka fa misy fanontaniana.
You may have already made two friends here.	Mety efa nahazo namana roa ianao teto.
Hope you like it !.	Manantena ianao fa tianao!.
He did it.	Nanao izany izy.
You have to eat food first.	Tsy maintsy mihinana sakafo aloha ianao.
I'm not used to it.	Tsy zatra aho.
Of course, this is true.	Mazava ho azy fa tanteraka izany.
Outside, he was alone.	Tany ivelany dia irery izy.
It is necessary.	Ilaina izany.
There must be someone.	Tsy maintsy misy olona.
And he knew it was wrong, too.	Ary fantany fa diso koa izany.
I went faster.	Nandeha haingana kokoa aho.
Maybe he’s the only one.	Angamba izy irery ihany.
two.	roa.
I didn’t even know you had a car.	Tsy fantatro akory hoe manana fiara ianao.
Maybe he’ll watch.	Angamba mba hijery izy.
She loves this room.	Tiany ity efitrano ity.
Lots of new stuff.	Betsaka ny zavatra vaovao.
You really slept.	Tena natory ianao.
The money stays here.	Mijanona eto ny vola.
The past, the present and the future as well.	Ny taloha sy ny ankehitriny ary ny ho avy koa.
It was good to talk to him.	Tsara ny niresaka taminy.
You don’t have them.	Tsy manana azy ireo ianao.
There was not much time for us.	Tsy nisy fotoana firy ho anay.
Busy morning again.	Maraina be atao indray.
Only then can you get an idea of ​​what is needed.	Avy eo vao afaka mahazo hevitra momba izay ilaina ianao.
He will be out soon.	Tsy ho ela dia hivoaka izy.
There were three problems with that.	Nisy olana telo tamin'izany.
This is the real problem.	Izao no olana mafy.
Everyone should know this.	Tokony ho fantatry ny rehetra izany.
When you’re little, you have to do it.	Rehefa kely ianao dia tsy maintsy manao izany.
They all sat down.	Nipetraka izy rehetra.
You need more.	Mila bebe kokoa ianao.
They came to work early in the morning and stayed a long time.	Vao maraina be izy ireo no tonga niasa ary nijanona ela be.
He really didn’t want to be here.	Tena tsy te ho eto izy.
Not stupid, stupid.	Tsy adala, adala.
I question everything now.	Manontany ny zava-drehetra aho izao.
I will never see them again now.	Tsy hahita azy ireo intsony aho ankehitriny.
I met him in a room.	Nihaona taminy tao amin’ny efitrano iray aho.
Yes, it is not.	Eny, tsy izany.
Things are in the room with us.	Ny zavatra dia ao amin'ny efitrano miaraka aminay.
It must be really hard.	Tsy maintsy sarotra tokoa izany.
Everyone saw what was happening, but no one helped.	Nahita ny zava-nitranga ny rehetra, saingy tsy nisy nanampy.
He really is.	Izy tokoa.
He behaved like a child.	Nitondra tena toy ny zaza izy.
So is everyone here.	Toy izany ny olona rehetra eto.
He was confused.	Very hevitra izy.
The man had a hard time reading.	Somary sarotra namaky ilay lehilahy.
Then no one spoke.	Dia tsy nisy niteny intsony.
And play well.	Ary milalao tsara.
I think he was the only one.	Heveriko fa izy irery ihany.
Sure, why not.	Azo antoka, nahoana no tsy.
But there is a problem.	Saingy misy olana iray.
And we are not alone.	Ary tsy irery isika.
He is looking at me now.	Mijery ahy izy izao.
You are looking for a story.	Mitady tantara ianao.
I don't remember what day.	Tsy tadidiko hoe andro inona.
No one is watching anymore.	Tsy misy mijery intsony.
I want you to know that well.	Tiako ho fantatrao tsara izany.
He still does.	Mbola manao izany izy.
No, no, not this man.	Tsia, tsia, tsy ity lehilahy ity.
For this reason, the two of us went there at night.	Noho izany antony izany dia nandeha tany izahay roa tamin'ny alina.
He could be one of the first or two to come out.	Mety ho iray amin'ireo voalohany na roa nivoaka izy.
I can't.	Tsy afaka aho.
I always see him die.	Mahita azy maty foana aho.
This land has no water.	Ity tany ity dia tsy misy rano.
Maybe the latter.	Angamba ity farany.
This has never happened before.	Tsy mbola nisy izany taloha.
When is the best time to do it?	Rahoviana no fotoana tsara indrindra hanaovana izany?
Lots of people.	Be dia be ny olona.
Everyone, this is the best man.	Ny olona rehetra dia ity no lehilahy tsara indrindra.
Now he finally understands what happened.	Ankehitriny dia azony ihany ny zava-nitranga.
Everything that a good person can do is him.	Ny zavatra rehetra mety ho olona tsara dia izy.
', he'.	', dia'.
When they do, it’s fun.	Rehefa manao izany izy ireo dia mahafinaritra.
He will come out eventually.	Hivoaka izy amin'ny farany.
But that is far from it.	Saingy lavitra izany.
I wish you could do this every day.	Tiako raha afaka manao an'io isan'andro ianao.
You can talk to anyone.	Afaka miresaka amin'ny olona rehetra ianao.
Something is difficult to do.	Misy zavatra sarotra atao.
It really doesn’t help.	Tena tsy manampy izany.
Not all patients are known.	Tsy fantatra ny marary rehetra.
That may be true.	Mety ho marina izany.
I’m not sure he likes her.	Tsy azoko antoka fa tiany izy.
We are in the wrong place at the wrong time and place.	Eo amin’ny toerana tsy mety amin’ny fotoana sy toerana tsy mety isika.
He could say he wasn’t going anywhere.	Afaka nilaza izy fa tsy handeha na aiza na aiza.
Very good book.	Boky tena tsara.
Not kind of bad.	Tsy karazana ratsy.
You have to expect that.	Tsy maintsy manantena izany ianao.
No problem.	Tsy hisy olana.
It’s hard for him.	Sarotra aminy.
He seemed to want to tell us something.	Toa te hilaza zavatra taminay izy.
There is nothing he can do now.	Tsy misy azony atao intsony izao.
They really had more money then.	Tena nanana vola bebe kokoa izy ireo tamin'izany.
I have to talk to him.	Tsy maintsy miresaka aminy aho.
A little big for girls.	Lehibe kely ho an'ny tovovavy.
You learn things as you go.	Mianatra zavatra ianao rehefa mandeha.
I don't understand him.	Tsy azoko izy.
They are the only ones who tell you.	Izy ireo ihany no milaza aminao.
I had never thought it could be like that before.	Mbola tsy nieritreritra ny mety ho toy izany mihitsy aho taloha.
Maybe one day somewhere like music.	Angamba indray andro any ho any toy ny mozika.
He is very small.	Tena kely izy.
It could be lost.	Mety ho very izany.
He is looking for himself.	Mitady ny tenany izy.
He didn't want me to go there.	Tsy tiany ho any aho.
I enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra ahy izany.
I don’t know why or what.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana na ahoana.
The police may come here at any time.	Mety ho tonga eto ny polisy na oviana na oviana.
There was indeed.	Nisy tokoa.
He was very angry at that.	Tena tezitra izy tamin'izany.
It was not easy to do so.	Tsy mora ny nanao izany.
I'm not angry.	Tsy tezitra aho.
However, it accomplished more.	Na izany aza, nahavita bebe kokoa.
I don’t know what will happen.	Tsy fantatro izay hitranga.
The work is not easy.	Tsy mora ny asa.
However, he was the only one who did it.	Na izany aza dia izy ihany no nanao izany.
He had no job and wanted to go.	Tsy nanana asa izy ary te handeha.
It’s okay if you don’t want to be together all the time.	Tsy maninona raha tsy te hiaraka foana.
He entered the house.	Niditra tao amin’ilay trano izy.
They are bad.	Ratsy izy ireo.
That's it, isn't it.	Izay no izy, sa tsy izany.
I will come to see you.	Ho avy hihaona aminao aho.
They are often longer than before.	Matetika izy ireo no lava kokoa noho ny teo aloha.
People were talking.	Niresaka ny olona.
He should be a big man by now.	Tokony ho lehilahy lehibe izy amin'izao fotoana izao.
Now it’s gone.	Ankehitriny dia lasa izany.
Little did he get.	Kely dia azony.
He was angry.	Tezitra izy.
But there is one that is a bit new.	Saingy misy iray izay somary vaovao.
You have to do it, for all of us.	Tsy maintsy manao izany ianao, ho antsika rehetra.
There is something completely wrong here.	Misy zavatra tsy marina tanteraka eto.
They didn’t really come out and tell me.	Tsy tena nivoaka izy ireo ary nilaza tamiko.
You are afraid of him.	Matahotra azy ianao.
I was there and did it.	Efa tany aho ary nanao izany.
He told me he couldn’t stay long.	Nilaza tamiko izy fa tsy afaka nijanona ela.
And you can't watch.	Ary tsy afaka mijery ianao.
He just needs the right timing.	Mila fotoana mety fotsiny izy.
This is almost impossible.	Saika tsy azo atao izany.
It’s like they’re playing.	Toy ny hoe milalao izy ireo.
I don't understand that.	Tsy azoko izany.
It started to rain when we arrived.	Nanomboka avy ny orana rehefa tonga izahay.
He couldn't do anything else.	Tsy afaka nanao zavatra hafa izy.
He was very wrong.	Tena diso izy.
We should look at it, not now.	Tokony hijery azy isika, fa tsy izao.
We will do anything for you.	Hanao na inona na inona ho anao izahay.
I can't work on myself.	Tsy azoko atao ny miasa amiko.
i love it so much	tiako be!
They need us and we need them.	Mila antsika izy ireo ary mila azy ireo isika.
She bought new clothes for the occasion.	Nividy akanjo vaovao ho an'ny fotoana izy.
And they are.	Ary izy ireo.
These are more than ever before.	Betsaka kokoa noho ny teo aloha ireo.
He waited to go home before he saw another dog.	Niandry ny hody izy vao nahita alika hafa.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Angamba, angamba, angamba.
We remained like that for a long time without speaking.	Nijanona toy izany izahay nandritra ny fotoana ela tsy niteny.
That could be a big mistake.	Mety ho fahadisoana lehibe izany.
Maybe he, one day or night, thought so to himself.	Angamba izy, indray andro na alina, dia nieritreritra izany ny tenany.
It's dead.	Maty ilay izy.
I need help.	Mila fanampiana aho.
So don't worry about me.	Koa aza manahy ahy ianareo.
He apologized and left.	Niala tsiny izy ka lasa.
Lots of good variety.	Maro karazana tsara.
I'm in the next room.	Ao amin'ny efitrano manaraka aho.
I did not see.	tsy nahita aho.
The dinner was delicious.	Nahafinaritra ny sakafo hariva.
He may be right, but I will still do it.	Mety ho marina izy, fa mbola hanao izany aho.
But everything is going well now.	Fa ny zavatra rehetra mandeha izao.
It works for both of them.	Miasa ho azy roa izy io.
I had one last question.	Nanana fanontaniana farany aho.
The girl was full of questions.	Feno fanontaniana ilay tovovavy.
And they probably talked about it.	Ary azo inoana fa niresaka momba izany izy ireo.
The food is very good and the house is very nice.	Tena tsara ny sakafo ary tena tsara ny trano.
But he.	Fa izy.
I really hope he does.	Tena manantena aho fa hanao izany izy.
He worked for them.	Niasa ho azy ireo izy.
In a word, full of people.	Amin'ny teny iray, feno olona.
I don’t know why he didn’t do it.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana izy no tsy nanao izany.
You are wonderful.	Mahafinaritra ianareo.
This is true for everyone.	Marina izany ho an'ny rehetra.
That is not enough for us.	Tsy ampy izany raha ny momba antsika.
All of these are good places.	Ireo rehetra ireo dia toerana tsara.
That's the only way.	Izany ihany no fomba.
Now it will get better soon.	Ankehitriny dia ho tsara kokoa tsy ho ela.
They said something.	Nilaza zavatra izy ireo.
I didn’t intend to do that.	Tsy nikasa hanao izany aho.
Full of fun.	Feno mahafinaritra.
He didn't ask anyone again.	Tsy nanontany olona intsony izy.
We won’t talk about that anymore.	Tsy hiresaka momba izany intsony isika.
He did not say a word about the time.	Tsy nilaza teny momba ilay fotoana izy.
No one was more confused than I was.	Tsy nisy olona very hevitra noho izaho.
Expect the worst in the future.	Manantena ny ratsy indrindra amin'ny ho avy.
She has a story with him.	Manana tantara miaraka aminy izy.
No, maybe you better not.	Tsia, angamba aleo tsy ianao.
We had a great time last summer.	Nanana fotoana mahafinaritra izahay tamin'ny fahavaratra lasa teo.
I don't see what happened.	Tsy hitako izay nitranga.
It's really not good.	Tena tsy tsara izany.
You must want to do that.	Tsy maintsy te hanao izany ianao.
I tried to write another story.	Nanandrana nanoratra tantara iray hafa aho.
He left the room.	Nivoaka ny efitrano izy.
Maybe he knew what was to come.	Angamba fantany izay ho avy.
I think the last time has come.	Heveriko fa tonga ny fotoana farany.
Of course, this is not an easy task.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy asa mora izany.
I am driving.	Mandeha fiara aho.
I don't see what he will do next.	Tsy hitako izay hataony manaraka.
This problem is already quite complex.	Ity olana ity dia efa somary sarotra.
He wants to live.	Te ho velona izy.
Maybe we will.	Angamba isika hanao izany.
He knew he was right.	Fantany fa marina izy.
Then we left.	Dia lasa izahay.
But, that’s it.	Saingy, izany no izy.
I may never see it.	Mety tsy hahita na oviana na oviana aho.
I looked at them and asked the man how much they were.	Nijery azy ireo aho ary nanontany ilay lehilahy hoe ohatrinona izy ireo.
Toa.	Toa .
They just do things differently than we do.	Manao zavatra tsy mitovy amin'ny antsika fotsiny izy ireo.
I’m sure, like me.	Azoko antoka, toa ahy.
He tried to help.	Niezaka nanampy izy.
He was sure he did.	Azony antoka fa nanao izany izy.
Very happy.	Tena faly.
The problem goes away.	Mandeha ny olana.
He never comes outside.	Tsy tonga any ivelany mihitsy izy.
There may be opportunities.	Mety misy ny fahafahana.
Just a little look.	Mijery kely fotsiny.
He is mine.	Ahy izy.
But we finally made a long trip and got inside.	Saingy nanao dia lavitra izahay tamin'ny farany ary niditra.
Everyone was talking.	Niresaka ny rehetra.
Does anyone live here?	Misy mipetraka ve eto?
We have to talk to.	Tsy maintsy miresaka amin'ny.
They have no idea in it.	Tsy manana hevitra ao aminy izy ireo.
Don’t make it harder than that.	Aza atao sarotra kokoa noho izany izany.
If breakfast is not late.	Raha tsy tara ny sakafo maraina.
No one should be like that.	Tsy misy olona tokony ho toy izany.
This is one of the last ones.	Ity no iray amin'ireo farany.
We can’t say we need them.	Tsy afaka milaza izahay fa mila azy ireo.
They came to help.	Tonga izy ireo hanampy.
He didn't know who he was.	Tsy fantany hoe iza izy.
Nothing good is done.	Tsy misy tsara atao.
He loves me too. 	Tia ahy koa izy. 
If it works for them.	Raha miasa ho azy ireo izany.
It’s hard to see if you go looking for him.	Sarotra ny mahita raha mandeha mitady azy ianao.
There are so many things.	Misy zavatra maro be.
But one day something will see him again.	Saingy indray andro any dia hisy zavatra hahita azy indray.
You don’t treat men like children.	Tsy mitondra lehilahy toy ny zaza ianao.
So, he is right.	Noho izany, marina ny azy.
Very hard.	Tena mafy.
You may have heard of me too.	Mety efa nandre momba ahy koa ianao.
But it’s too good a time not to go wrong.	Fa fotoana tsara loatra tsy ho diso izany.
Or just getting to know me.	Na ny mahafantatra ahy fotsiny.
That could be bad.	Mety ho ratsy izany.
It is wrong not to speak.	Tsy mety ny tsy miteny.
None of that went to housing assistance.	Tsy nisy tamin'izany no nandeha tamin'ny fanampiana trano.
You will never know.	Tsy ho fantatrao.
I wanted to do it again.	Naniry hanao izany indray aho.
Now if you just come here.	Ankehitriny raha ho avy eto fotsiny ianao.
Such is the real patient.	Toy izany ny tena marary.
With i.	Miaraka amin'ny i.
Maybe we should go.	Angamba tokony handeha isika.
The years seemed to pass quickly.	Toa nandeha haingana ny taona.
They love me.	Tia ahy izy ireo.
I was hoping too.	Nanantena koa aho.
Or the latter.	Na ny farany.
If they don’t, no.	Raha tsy manao izany izy ireo dia tsia.
You may ask why.	Azonao atao ny manontany hoe nahoana.
You don’t have to make the movie.	Tsy mila manao ilay sarimihetsika ianao.
In fact, it is not a question of the past.	Raha ny tena izy dia tsy fanontaniana momba ny lasa.
And that's enough.	Ary ampy izay.
I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it.	Nanontany azy aho, ary nilaza izy fa te hanao izany.

I don’t like that idea either.	Tsy tiako koa io hevitra io.
I will buy more !.	Hividy bebe kokoa aho!.
They do, nothing.	Manao izy ireo, tsy misy.
I did both.	Samy nataoko.
It doesn’t say anything to me.	Tsy milaza na inona na inona amiko izany.

I see clearly in this.	Hitako mazava tsara amin'ity.
It's been too long.	Efa ela loatra izany.

There’s a lot more, too.	Mbola betsaka ihany koa.
I was the only one who saw anything.	Izaho irery no nahita na inona na inona.
These people are right.	Marina ireo olona ireo.
He went back to his room.	Niverina tao amin’ny efitranony izy.
I know him well.	Fantatro tsara izy.
It was really fun and they were happy to take us there.	Tena nahafinaritra izany ary nahafinaritra azy ireo ny nitondra anay tany.

Can anyone help me with that please.	Misy afaka manampy ahy amin'izany ve azafady.

It was still there.	Teo ihany ilay izy.
Nothing will be easy.	Tsy misy ho mora.
Maybe they don’t.	Angamba tsy manao izany izy ireo.

Kids can get it.	Afaka mahazo izany ny ankizy.
Nice night and day.	Mahafinaritra ny alina sy ny andro.

Not at all.	Tsy izany mihitsy.
He is very articulate.	Tena mahay miteny izy.
They also asked me.	Nanontany ahy koa izy ireo.
You know you are so beautiful.	Fantatrao fa tena tsara tarehy ianao.
Another year passed.	Taona iray indray no lasa.
Expect a little maybe.	Nanantena kely angamba.
They are very beautiful and easy to make.	Tena tsara tarehy izy ireo ary mora atao.
He was confused at first.	Very hevitra izy tamin’ny voalohany.
That’s what he likes.	Izany no tiany.
Either way it can work.	Na izany na tsy izany dia afaka miasa.
And fast with that.	Ary haingana amin'izany.
I was really surprised.	Tena gaga aho.
But they haven’t done it yet.	Saingy tsy mbola nanao izany izy ireo.
Still another problem.	Mbola olana hafa.
There never was.	Tsy nisy mihitsy.
But when it comes, it goes.	Fa tonga izany, dia mandeha.
He plays like that.	Milalao toy izany izy.
Maybe you have to.	Mety tsy maintsy ho ianao.
But the years went by.	Fa nandeha ny taona.
It is not today.	Tsy androany izany.
He knows a lot about film.	Mahay zavatra betsaka momba ny sarimihetsika izy.
A few years ago.	Taona vitsivitsy lasa izay.
The land of freedom.	Ny tany fahafahana.
You got us well.	Nahazo anay tsara ianao.
The news is never good.	Tsy tsara mihitsy ny vaovao.
And he's not here.	Ary tsy eto izy.
And that's true.	Ary marina izany.

He seems confused.	Toa very hevitra izy.
This seems more plausible now.	Toa azo inoana kokoa izany amin'izao fotoana izao.
And you know me.	Ary fantatrao aho.
We are not at all.	Tsy izany mihitsy isika.
I need to learn two.	Mila mianatra roa aho.

Such an idea may and may even be necessary.	Mety ho mety ary ilaina mihitsy aza ny hevitra toy izany.

Otherwise, everyone will be able to tell.	Raha tsy izany dia ho afaka hilaza ny rehetra.
Something is coming to you soon.	Misy zavatra ho avy aminao tsy ho ela.

Don’t get me wrong it was really good.	Aza diso aho fa tena tsara ilay izy.

When it comes to that.	Raha tonga amin'izany.
And yet, it was here.	Ary na izany aza, dia teto.
You don't see anyone.	Tsy mahita olona ianao.
I talked about it.	Niresaka momba izany aho.
But it never happened to us.	Saingy tsy nisy taminay mihitsy izany.
The car started to stop.	Nanomboka nijanona ny fiara.
Probably very good.	Tena tsara angamba.
I don’t know what would have happened without it.	Tsy haiko izay mety ho nitranga raha tsy nisy an'io.
We went there and talked.	Nandeha tany izahay ary niresaka.
This movie.	Ity sarimihetsika ity.
And it just started.	Ary vao nanomboka izany.
Come morning you should be real.	Tonga maraina dia tokony ho tena ianao.
We’ve done it well.	Efa nanao izany tsara izahay.

At first it was a good idea.	Amin'ny voalohany dia hevitra tsara.
The car stopped.	Nijanona ny fiara.
I really like it.	Tena tiako izany.
He felt awkward.	Nahatsiaro ho sahirana izy.
This is perfect.	Izany dia tanteraka.
We have to get out of here.	Tsy maintsy miala eto isika.
It doesn't work.	Tsy mandeha izany.
It’s really fun to have friends.	Tena mahafinaritra ny manana namana.
And if men don’t know it, women certainly know it.	Ary raha tsy fantatry ny lehilahy izany dia azo antoka fa fantatry ny vehivavy izany.
He has traveled a long way.	Efa nanao dia lavitra izy.
Not only this.	Tsy ity ihany.
Got in his car.	Niditra tao anaty fiarany.
He did have a book.	Nanana boky tokoa izy.

He was very happy in the movie.	Faly be izy tao amin'ilay sarimihetsika.
I think you are right.	Heveriko fa marina ny anao.
And that is not possible.	Ary tsy azo atao izany.
They no longer needed it.	Tsy nila izany intsony izy ireo.
But there is something worse.	Saingy mbola misy zavatra ratsy kokoa.
I didn’t see it for a few minutes.	Tsy nahita aho nandritra ny minitra vitsivitsy.
In any case, you will know these things again.	Na ahoana na ahoana dia ho fantatrao indray ireo zavatra ireo.
She really loves him.	Tena tiany izy.

He was very angry.	Tena tezitra izy.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Tsy misy azonao atao momba izany.
I’m pretty sure we will.	Tena azoko antoka fa hanao izany isika.
Like this morning.	Toy izao maraina izao.

This is good news.	Vaovao tsara izany.
And no more.	Ary tsy mihoatra izany.

It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona izany.
It’s a pretty little thing.	Zavatra kely tsara tarehy izany.

But, he hoped.	Saingy, nanantena izy.
They are not too bad.	Tsy dia ratsy loatra izy ireo.
Tell him it's me.	Lazao azy fa izaho io.
You don’t care.	Tsy miraharaha ianao.
Someone got a picture of it.	Nisy nahazo sary an'izany.
So it doesn't matter.	Ka tsy maninona.
It’s not over yet.	Mbola tsy vita izany.
I knew I had mine.	Fantatro fa efa nisy ny ahy.
I just lived there.	Vao nipetraka tao aho.
Not so bad at all.	Tsy dia ratsy toy izany rehetra izany.
But that is not true.	Saingy tsy marina izany.
I entered him.	Niditra taminy aho.
I don't know which way.	Tsy haiko izay lalana.
But it doesn’t always work.	Saingy tsy mandeha foana izany.
I'll be back, but I haven't come yet.	Mbola hiverina aho, fa tsy mbola tonga.
But that's it.	Fa izany no izy.
And we almost did.	Ary saika nanao izany izahay.
Nothing can be done, nothing can be done.	Tsy misy azo atao, tsy misy azo atao.
He will see you.	Hahita anao izy.
So at other times.	Koa amin'ny fotoana hafa.
I work hard for them.	Miasa mafy ho azy ireo aho.
I sat down.	Nipetraka aho.
We couldn’t have done it without them.	Tsy afaka nanao izany izahay raha tsy nisy azy ireo.
This beautiful home is two houses in one.	Ity trano tsara tarehy ity dia trano roa ao anatin'ny iray.
We can't do that.	Tsy afaka manao izany izahay.
We never wanted him.	Tsy naniry azy mihitsy izahay.
Very good for you !!.	Tena tsara ho anao!!.
He tried but could not speak.	Niezaka izy fa tsy afaka niteny.
So, it’s fun.	Noho izany, mahafinaritra izany.
They said it would never come for us, not now.	Nilaza izy ireo fa tsy ho avy ho antsika mihitsy, tsy izao.
And good enough.	Ary ampy tsara.
Both reasons brought something different.	Samy nitondra zavatra hafa ny antony.
The police arrived early in the morning.	Vao maraina be vao tonga ny polisy.
He is crazy.	Adala izy.
There were also women.	Nisy vehivavy koa teo.
He is long gone.	Efa ela izy no lasa.

He hasn't spent much time thinking about this issue.	Mbola tsy nandany fotoana firy izy nieritreritra an’io olana io.
No one is happy.	Tsy misy faly.
So what is it.	Dia inona izany.
Don’t believe the stories about us.	Aza mino ny tantara momba anay.
We will win.	Handresy isika.
Everything is going well, but that stuff can still happen.	Manao tsara ny zava-drehetra, saingy mbola mety hitranga izany zavatra izany.
Of course, that is not the only problem.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izany ihany no olana.
He has a lot of opportunities.	Manana fahafahana be dia be izy.
Or you may not like it.	Na mety tsy tianao izany.
Questions?	Fanontaniana?

I looked at him.	Nijery azy aho.
I said no again.	Nolazaiko indray fa tsia.

Do you still think this is a “bad” movie?	Mbola mihevitra ve ianao fa sarimihetsika "ratsy" ity?
An elderly man was sitting nearby, reading a book.	Nisy lehilahy be taona iray nipetraka teo akaiky teo, namaky boky.
Everything, no matter what, is the reason here.	Ny zava-drehetra, na inona na inona, izany no antony eto.

There is no time for that now.	Tsy misy fotoana ho amin'izany izao.

I didn’t start too late.	Tsy nanomboka tara loatra aho.
That was it, in the end.	Izay izy, tamin'ny farany.
No one is interested in the past.	Tsy misy olona liana amin'ny lasa.
I sat for another hour.	Nipetraka adiny iray indray aho.
She is as beautiful as ever.	Tsara tarehy toy ny taloha izy.

And this is what happened.	Ary izao no nitranga.
He was sure there would be a party.	Azony antoka fa hisy fety.
Just a little crazy.	Somary adala ihany.
I sat watching him.	Nipetraka aho nijery azy.
I don't know what.	Tsy fantatro hoe inona.
It can’t be right, it can’t be right.	Tsy mety ho marina izany, tsy mety ho marina.
If not, it might be best to leave.	Raha tsy izany dia mety tsara raha miala ianao.
That is a very good question.	Fanontaniana tena tsara izany.
I tried to talk to him.	Niezaka niresaka taminy aho.

Well, not at first, though.	Eny, tsy amin'ny voalohany, na izany aza.
Many former beliefs have become more plausible.	Betsaka ny zavatra inoana taloha no lasa azo inoana kokoa.
Just like he did last year.	Toy ny nataony tamin’ny taona lasa.
All that was wrong was me.	Izay tsy nety rehetra dia izaho izany.
Yes, it takes some time.	Eny, mila fotoana kely izany.
That was immediately when you stopped.	Izany dia avy hatrany rehefa nijanona ianao.
He understood it well.	Azony tsara izany.
Yes, it will not happen.	Eny, tsy hitranga.
There is money here.	Misy vola eto.
Not yet lucky.	Tsy mbola vintana.
There are many reasons not to.	Maro ny antony tsy tokony hataony.
We were already there.	Efa tany izahay.
I will know.	Ho fantatro.
About three months.	Telo volana eo ho eo.
He fell asleep again.	Natory indray izy.
If possible, you know, people will do it.	Raha azo atao, fantatrao, ny olona no hanao izany.
I think you have to know.	Heveriko fa tsy maintsy ho fantatrao.
Then they went in again.	Dia niditra indray izy ireo.
There are many reasons for this idea.	Maro ny antony nahatonga io hevitra io.
They absolutely believe they did.	Tena mino tanteraka izy ireo fa nanao izany izy ireo.
I love you and everyone.	Tiako ianao sy ny rehetra.
They can’t have both.	Tsy afaka manana izy roa.
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
I don't need it now.	Tsy mila izany aho izao.
He is done.	Vita izy.
Well, now that’s about it.	Eny, amin'izao fotoana izao ny momba izany.
And we thought that might not be right.	Ary nihevitra izahay fa mety tsy mety izany.
They may come very quickly.	Mety ho tonga haingana be izy ireo.
Whatever is wrong, we will talk about it.	Na inona na inona tsy mety dia hiresaka momba izany isika.
He has been doing this for a long time.	Efa ela izy no nanao izany.
I can have it.	Afaka manana izany aho.
There must be danger.	Tsy maintsy misy loza.
They were so scared that they said nothing.	Natahotra loatra izy ireo ka tsy nilaza na inona na inona.
Then he knew.	Dia fantany.
He never left the house.	Tsy nivoaka ny trano mihitsy.
Yes, there is no guarantee.	Eny, tsy misy antoka.
It is not possible to drive more.	Tsy azo atao ny mitondra fiara bebe kokoa.
However, it is done.	Na izany aza, vita izany.
It was really fast.	Haingana tokoa izany.
Anything could happen.	Tsy fantatra izay mety hitranga.
It doesn't seem to work.	Toa tsy mandeha izany.
Beautiful child.	Zaza tsara tarehy.
You are wrong in history.	Diso amin'ny tantara ianao.
How appropriate.	Ahoana no mety.
I looked at him nervously.	Nijery azy natahotra aho.
I'm sure of that.	Azoko antoka izany.
I didn’t want anything.	Tsy naniry na inona na inona aho.
He wasn't sure.	Tsy azony antoka.
If we still need it.	Raha mbola mila izany isika.
He never went, because when the house died, he lived.	Tsy nandeha mihitsy izy, satria rehefa maty ny trano dia velona izy.
There are two known reasons.	Misy antony roa fantatra.
I saw the water.	Hitako ny rano.
It was in the day.	Tamin'ny andro izany.
He has already spent enough time.	Efa nandany fotoana ampy izy.
I didn’t think well.	Tsy nieritreritra tsara aho.
He was everything to her.	Izy no zava-drehetra taminy.
Did he try and get it.	Nanandrana ve izy ary nahazo.
This is probably the last time.	Izao angamba no fotoana farany.
Or not dead, anyway.	Na tsy maty, na ahoana na ahoana.
Maybe because of the money.	Noho ny vola angamba.
If he wants to.	Raha tiany.
'of'.	'ny'.
You are long gone.	Efa ela ianao no lasa.
It is also true that we have been here before.	Marina koa fa efa teto isika taloha.
He had too much of one.	Nanana iray be loatra izy.
She will be well together.	Hiaraka tsara izy.
And so they are.	Dia toy izany izy ireo.
You are in this story.	Ao amin'ity tantara ity ianao.
We left the house.	Nivoaka ny trano izahay.
It should still be here, don’t worry.	Tokony mbola eto izany, aza manahy.
I want her to be happy.	Tiako ho faly izy.
I’m used to working hard.	Efa zatra miasa mafy aho.
I was the last to leave.	Izaho no niala farany.
It's too easy.	Mora loatra izany.
Maybe we should do something a little more.	Angamba tokony hanao zavatra kely kokoa isika.
Of course, yes.	Mazava ho azy, eny.
Didn't add an image.	Tsy nanampy ny sary iray.
This is another story.	Tantara hafa izany.
And you get it.	Ary azonao izany.
It could be a man.	Mety ho lehilahy izany.
But here he is now.	Fa teto izy izao.
No problem there.	Tsy misy olana any.
He also wondered.	Nanontany tena koa izy.
But you are mine now.	Fa ahy ianao izao.
You will immediately know what kind of man.	Ho fantatrao avy hatrany ny karazana lehilahy.
I just had to be sure.	Tsy maintsy nahazo antoka fotsiny aho.
The men returned.	Niverina indray ireo lehilahy ireo.
I still did.	Mbola nanao izany aho.
He must have made them.	Tsy maintsy izy no nanao azy ireo.
I absolutely love it.	Tiako tanteraka.
Really childish.	Tena zaza tokoa.
That's enough about me.	Ampy izay ny momba ahy.
Of course.	Mazava ho azy.
I really liked it then.	Tena tiako izany tamin'izany.
They have been here for three years.	Telo taona izy ireo no teto.
I am very different.	Tena hafa mihitsy aho.
If you didn’t know, you must have slept in the meeting.	Raha tsy fantatrao dia tsy maintsy ho natory tao amin'ny fivoriana ianao.
Tonight you will help.	Anio alina dia hanampy ianao.
Difficult, but impossible.	Sarotra, nefa tsy azo atao.
This is not the case.	Tsy izany no izy.
She is very happy.	Tena faly izy.
He seemed to be asleep.	Toa natory izy.
No one was our age.	Tsy nisy olona mitovy taona aminay.
This is where things don’t go.	Eto no tsy mandeha ny zava-drehetra.
People didn’t really look.	Tsy tena nijery ny olona.
The idea doesn’t exist.	Tsy misy ilay hevitra.
Once in a while you get lucky.	Indray mandeha ianao dia mahazo vintana.
You can get them.	Afaka mahazo azy ireo ianao.
The work helped me.	Nanampy ahy ny asa.
You may have wondered why.	Mety ho nanontany tena mihitsy ianao hoe nahoana.
They did not come.	Tsy tonga izy ireo.
I don’t hope you get it.	Tsy manantena aho fa ho azonao izany.
Bigger than him.	Lehibe noho ny azy.
And people still go there.	Ary mbola mandeha any ihany ny olona.
I really decided that.	Tena nanapa-kevitra izany aho.
To me, now is the time.	Amiko dia izao no fotoana.
In fact, it’s not too close.	Raha ny marina, tsy dia akaiky loatra izany.
Have some food, please.	Misy sakafo raha tianao, azafady.
Or you might do it.	Na mety hanao izany ianao.
It is possible.	Azo atao izany.
Of course this is wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa diso izany.
It worked well.	Niasa tsara izany.
And not just one but he was the first.	Ary tsy iray ihany fa izy no voalohany.
And we make new friends who are different from us.	Ary mahazo namana vaovao tsy mitovy aminay izahay.
So there is such a thing.	Noho izany dia misy ny toy izany.
I loved it once.	Tiako izany indray mandeha.
The rain stopped overnight.	Nijanona ny orana nandritra ny alina.
Nothing happened on the trip.	Tsy nisy zava-nitranga ny dia.
No, there was nowhere.	Tsia, tsy nisy na taiza na taiza.
Others could not.	Ny hafa tsy afaka nanao izany.
Of course he does.	Mazava ho azy fa manao izany izy.
He can’t carry something like that for long.	Tsy afaka mitondra zavatra toy izany ela izy.
Her teacher spoke again.	Niteny indray ny mpampianatra azy.
There must have been something wrong.	Tsy maintsy nisy zavatra tsy nety.
It's never too late.	Tsy tara mihitsy.
They will not go wrong.	Tsy ho diso sakafo izy ireo.
He saw nothing.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona izy.
This is a big problem.	Olana lehibe izany.
Maybe nothing is needed anymore.	Angamba tsy misy zavatra ilaina intsony.
However, it will be very difficult.	Na izany aza dia ho tena sarotra.
Two minutes is two minutes.	Roa minitra dia roa minitra.
The word is not new.	Ny teny hoe tsy vaovao.
We will do the same next month.	Hanao toy izany koa isika amin’ny volana ho avy.
And it was really nice to meet you.	Ary tena nahafinaritra ny nihaona taminao.
He did not do so, even in the early hours of the morning.	Tsy nanao izany izy, na dia vao maraina aza.
I really know that.	Tena fantatro izany.
But he did.	Nefa nataony izany.
They are not used to newcomers.	Tsy zatra amin’ireo vao tonga izy ireo.
Any help? 	Misy fanampiana?
thank you.	misaotra.
I have a better house for you.	Manana trano tsara kokoa ho anao aho.
Let's do it earlier.	Aleo atao aloha kokoa izany.
I tried for a long time.	Nanandrana ela be aho.
It’s very clear to me that you didn’t.	Tena mazava amiko fa tsy nanao izany ianao.
He does no wrong.	Tsy manao ratsy izy.
And in fact, it’s a good fit.	Ary raha ny marina dia mety tsara izany.
She really loves him.	Tena tiany izy.
At the moment.	Amin'izao fotoana izao.
I'm really here.	tena eto aho.
He did the same.	Toy izany koa no nataony.
He should leave and he should leave now.	Tokony hiala izy ary tokony hiala izao.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.
It's easy.	Mora izany.
I don't see anyone following him.	Tsy mahita olona manaraka azy aho.
I just looked at them.	Nijery azy ireo fotsiny aho.
Now that’s a little different story.	Ankehitriny dia tantara hafa kely izany.
These are the best times.	Ireo no fotoana tsara indrindra.
I really doubt that.	Tena misalasala aho izany.
And he sat on the ground.	Dia nipetraka teo amin’ny tany izy.
I have to say.	Tsy maintsy miteny aho.
It is small, and very far away.	Kely izy io, ary tena lavitra tokoa.
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
When you have it, you have it.	Rehefa manana izany ianao dia manana izany.
It’s playing with him.	Milalao aminy io.
That won't happen until next year.	Tsy hitranga izany raha tsy amin’ny taona ho avy.
But you don’t have to work about it.	Saingy tsy mila miasa ianao momba izany.
This is not the time.	Tsy fotoana izao.
Many loved him.	Maro no tia azy.
He came here recently.	Tonga teto izy vao haingana.
Another time and it may be too late.	Fotoana iray hafa ary mety ho tara loatra.
This can be done at any time of the year.	Izany dia azo atao amin'ny fotoana rehetra ao anatin'ny taona.
You met him.	Nihaona taminy ianao.
There was something about him.	Nisy zavatra momba azy.
You can buy anything there.	Afaka mividy na inona na inona ianao any.
Last time for you.	Fotoana farany ho anao.
It is too late.	Efa tara loatra izao.
I think I can still.	Heveriko fa mbola afaka.
They could be me.	Mety ho ahy izy ireo.
I can't say at all.	Tsy afaka milaza mihitsy.
These same people.	Ireo olona ireo ihany.
If he has enough time, he will be great.	Raha manana fotoana ampy izy dia ho lehibe.
In a few days he will be here.	Afaka andro vitsivitsy dia ho tonga eto izy.
He is gone.	Efa lasa izy.
When you watch a movie, you don’t know the music.	Rehefa mijery ny sarimihetsika ianao dia tsy mahafantatra ny mozika.
Although not so.	Na dia tsy toy izany aza.
I won't even talk about it.	Tsy hiresaka izany akory.
Fast and safe, that’s the way to do it.	Haingana sy azo antoka, izany no fomba hanaovana izany.
It was like it had a place to be.	Toy ny nanana toerana tokony hisy azy.
He works.	Miasa izy.
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
I don’t really need the work.	Tsy dia mila ny asa aho.
You have enough time.	Manana fotoana ampy ianao.
We really enjoyed reading this book.	Tena nahafinaritra anay ny namaky ity boky ity.
People do that.	Manao izany ny olona.
Just there.	Teo ihany.
Both of them.	Izy roa.
No, you didn't do anything wrong.	Tsia, tsy nanao ratsy ianao.
Of course not.	Mazava ho azy fa tsia.
Children learn to walk	Mianatra mandeha ny ankizy
I like the thing.	Tiako ilay zavatra.
I hope to get back to when the question is.	Manantena ny hiverina aho fa rahoviana ny fanontaniana.
They were both surprised.	Samy gaga izy ireo.
Probably years ago.	Mety taona maro lasa izay.
I may be wrong about that.	Mety ho diso hevitra aho momba izany.
I think we have to think.	Heveriko fa tsy maintsy mihevitra isika.
We should be together.	Tokony hiaraka isika.
This is the best time of day.	Izany no fotoana tsara indrindra isan'andro.
Looks like no one can help him.	Toa tsy misy afaka manampy azy.
He didn't tell me.	Tsy nilaza tamiko izy.

Something else.	Zavatra hafa koa.
This is not a problem for you.	Tsy olana aminao izany.
The problem comes here.	Tonga eto ny olana.
I am always angry.	Tezitra foana aho.
We decided on these questions.	Nanapa-kevitra ireo fanontaniana ireo izahay.
That's better.	Tsara kokoa izany.

And we will win.	Ary handresy isika.
When he thought about it now.	Rehefa nieritreritra izany izy izao.

Hard, hard, hard.	Sarotra, mafy, mafy.
He has no job.	Tsy manana asa izy.
I was a little surprised.	Somary gaga aho.

But don’t ask him about it.	Fa aza manontany azy momba izany.
He is long gone.	Efa ela izy no lasa.
They live here.	Mipetraka eto izy ireo.
This is similar to other issues.	Ity dia mitovy amin'ny olana hafa.
Apparently not.	Toa tsy izy.
I just want to see something, no matter what, happen.	Te hahita zavatra, na inona na inona, hitranga fotsiny aho.

But that’s good enough.	Saingy ampy tsara izany.
It shouldn’t be hard to find a good place.	Tsy tokony ho sarotra ny mitady toerana tsara.
Maybe because he was sure he would be there.	Angamba satria azony antoka fa ho eny izy.

There must be a story in it.	Tsy maintsy misy tantara ao.

Maybe it’s right for you, and it’s fun if that’s the case.	Angamba mety aminao izany, ary mahafinaritra izany raha izany no izy.

It's early in the morning.	Vao maraina io.

We need to do something.	Mila manao zavatra isika.

I don’t even remember him meeting her.	Tsy tadidiko mihitsy hoe nihaona taminy izy.
What's the news today?	Inona ny vaovao androany?
But of course it came.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa tonga izany.

To do all the same.	Ny hanao izany rehetra izany ihany.

This is the end.	Izany no farany.

Often.	Matetika.

Yes, this one is a little different.	Eny, hafa kely ity iray ity.
Safe home.	Trano azo antoka.
He was surprised.	Gaga izy.
I just can’t stay with this book.	Tsy afaka mijanona amin'ity boky ity fotsiny aho.
They got me.	Nahazo ahy izy ireo.
This is the best two weeks of the year here !.	Ity no herinandro roa tsara indrindra amin'ny taona eto!.
I refused.	Tsy nety aho tamin'izany.
Maybe he'll be happy.	Angamba ho faly izy.
The car went well.	Nandeha tsara ny fiara.
Lots of fun.	Be dia be ny mahafinaritra.
We still have it.	Mbola manana izany isika.
It doesn’t matter.	Tsy miraharaha izany.
I haven’t been there, not even once.	Mbola tsy tany aho, na indray mandeha aza.
That seems to be true.	Toa marina izany.
He saw her coming and going.	Nahita azy tonga sy nandeha izy.
Others don’t seem to have it.	Ny hafa toa tsy manana.
You think more.	Mieritreritra bebe kokoa ianao.
No one knows why.	Tsy misy mahalala ny antony.
We drove for hours.	Nandeha fiara nandritra ny ora maro izahay.
I really remember.	Tena tadidiko.
It didn’t seem to happen.	Toa tsy nisy izany.
One is enough for all women.	Ampy ho an'ny vehivavy rehetra ny iray.
He already loves other women.	Efa tia vehivavy hafa izy.
Everything else is fine.	Tsara daholo ny zavatra hafa rehetra.
He is always looking for me.	Mitady ahy foana izy.
It has to stop.	Tsy maintsy mijanona izany.
I don’t like them.	Tsy tiako izy ireo.
Maybe no one was free.	Angamba tsy nisy afaka.
They must have gone crazy there.	Tsy maintsy lasa adala izy ireo any.
Then he went into his room.	Dia niditra tao amin’ny efitranony izy.
We learned something.	Nianatra zavatra izahay.
The car is very safe.	Tena azo antoka ny fiara.
We will get a little help no matter what.	Hahazo fanampiana kely izahay na inona.
Here we go.	Lasa izao.
They think he will come back.	Mihevitra izy ireo fa hiverina izy.
So no one is not here.	Ka tsy misy olona tsy eto.
It will be known.	Ho fantatra izany.
I have never seen a woman like you.	Mbola tsy nahita vehivavy toa anao aho.
But, say you need more.	Saingy, lazao fa mila bebe kokoa ianao.
There was no money then.	Tsy nisy vola tamin’izany.
I did it.	Nahavita izany aho.
I found the truth.	Hitako ny marina.
All pictures are mine.	Ny sary rehetra dia ahy.
Can't stay here overnight.	Tsy afaka mijanona eto mandritra ny alina.
You are in the book.	Ao amin'ny boky ianao.
To have a lot, but still a little.	Ny manana be dia be, nefa mbola kely.
That's what happened here tonight.	Izany no nitranga teto androany alina.
And they had a party.	Ary nanao fety izy ireo.
I don't know how to do this.	Tsy haiko ny fomba hanaovana an'io.
He drank water.	Nisotro rano izy.
I don't understand that.	Tsy azoko izany.
In the end, the people did what they had to do to survive.	Tamin'ny farany dia nanao izay tokony hataony ny olona mba ho velona.
It’s not the same at all.	Tsy mitovy aminy mihitsy.
It was there all morning.	Teo ny maraina rehetra.
There is only one problem.	Iray ihany ny olana.
He told me not to get anything.	Nilaza tamiko izy mba tsy hahazo na inona na inona.
It’s hard to say.	Sarotra ny nilaza izany.
Of course, he was right.	Mazava ho azy fa tena marina izy.
I thought it was fun !.	Nihevitra aho fa mahafinaritra!.
You do your best.	Manao ny tsara indrindra ianao.
I haven't seen him in hours.	Efa ora maro aho no tsy nahita azy.
And so will you.	Ary ho toy izany koa ianao.
And he was very angry.	Ary tezitra mafy izy.
The first year was really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra ny taona voalohany.
And he has been.	Ary efa nisy izy.
You are a little friend.	Namana kely ianao.
It’s more than that.	Mihoatra izany.
I never thought of that.	Mbola tsy nieritreritra an’izany mihitsy aho.
It could be anything.	Mety ho na inona na inona izany.
You are needed.	Ilaina ianao.
That's all for today.	Izay ihany ny anio.
This is very bad for him.	Tena ratsy ho azy izany.
I'm done asking.	Vita ny nanontany aho.
No one is sitting.	Tsy misy mipetraka.
Nothing came out of nowhere.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona nivoaka avy tamin'ny tsy misy.
I do not understand.	tsy azoko.
So they don't know.	Ka tsy fantany.
He was unconscious.	Tsy nahatsiaro tena intsony izy.
He was good to me.	Tsara tamiko izy.
And there may be some truth to that.	Ary mety misy ny marina momba izany.
Lots of books.	Betsaka ny boky.
Picture, don't worry about it.	Sary, aza manahy momba azy ianao.
Not yet together.	Tsy mbola niaraka.
I thought it would never stop.	Nihevitra aho fa tsy hijanona mihitsy izany.
And mine was no different.	Ary tsy nisy hafa ny ahy.
She is very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy izy.
One day.	Indray andro.
They really love me.	Tena tia ahy izy ireo.
You now know what you are.	Fantatrao izao hoe inona ianao.
There is no real reason.	Tsy misy antony marina.
I'm not crazy.	Tsy adala aho.
I know him well.	Fantatro tsara izy.
Then we thought.	Dia nieritreritra izahay.
I'm not sure there's anything else.	Tsy azoko antoka fa misy zavatra hafa.
He is still crazy.	Mbola adala ihany izy.
He will go home when the work is done.	Hody izy rehefa vita ny asa.
It’s always been fun.	Izany foana no nahafinaritra foana.
However, it is a very special book.	Na izany aza, dia tena boky manokana.
They will come back later.	Mbola hiverina izy ireo rehefa avy eo.
I was talking to a friend recently.	Niresaka tamin’ny namana iray aho vao haingana.
The future is yours, and all that is mine is yours.	Anao ny ho avy, anao koa izay ahy rehetra.
You won't be in trouble.	Tsy ho sahirana ianao.
To do it once.	Mba hanaovana izany indray mandeha.
‘have’.	' manana '.
I can't do it alone.	Tsy vitako irery.
Just crazy.	Adala fotsiny.
It's hard to say.	Sarotra ny miteny.
But that’s not about it.	Saingy tsy momba izany izany.
Of course, he didn't.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao izany izy.
Still unable to wonder where it was, another came and went.	Mbola tsy afaka nanontany tena hoe taiza ilay izy, dia nisy iray hafa tonga ary lasa.
These kids are lucky.	Tsara vintana ireo ankizy ireo.
He became a teacher.	Lasa mpampianatra izy.
I would like to add that everything is going well.	Tiako ny manampy fa mandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
I don’t even know what it is.	Tsy fantatro akory hoe inona izany.
He looked at her.	Nijery azy izy.
It happened quickly.	Nitranga haingana izany.
They are a bit small.	Somary kely izy ireo.
He knew the place well.	Fantany tsara ilay toerana.
And more.	Ary mihoatra.
This is going to be a big day.	Ho andro lehibe izao.
They are not completely wrong.	Tsy diso tanteraka izy ireo.
No one is near you.	Tsy misy akaiky anao.
What is close.	Inona no akaiky.
There is no time to lose.	Tsy misy fotoana ho very.
It may not be good, but there is.	Mety tsy ho tsara ilay izy, fa misy.
There is no such thing.	Tsy misy toy izany.
Even water may not be enough.	Na ny rano aza mety tsy ampy.
It’s better not to see them often.	Aleo tsy mahita azy ireo matetika.
When the meal was over, he arrived.	Tonga izy, rehefa vita ny sakafo.
That is true.	Marina izany.
Maybe it wasn’t.	Angamba tsy nisy izany.
I guess you weren't there.	Ataoko fa tsy teo ianao.
They are not just scared.	Tsy matahotra fotsiny izy ireo.
Something felt wrong.	Nisy zavatra nahatsiaro ho tsy nety.
He is different.	Hafa izy.
I thought not.	Noheveriko fa tsy.
you are used to it.	zatra izany ianao.
But then someone else called him something else.	Saingy avy eo dia nisy olona hafa niantso azy ho zavatra hafa.
Without good, there is no evil.	Raha tsy misy ny tsara dia tsy misy ny ratsy.
I should have stayed with him.	Tokony nijanona niaraka taminy aho.
He just didn’t hear.	Tsy nandre fotsiny izy.
He has a job.	Manana asa izy.
It’s just a disaster.	Loza ihany io.
Hope you come back often !.	Manantena anao hiverina matetika!.
Some do not know what to do.	Misy tsy mahalala izay tokony hatao.
I have come a long way.	Efa nandeha lavitra aho.
It's all gone.	Very daholo.
It’s almost not enough.	Saika tsy ampy izany.
Nothing too much please.	Tsy misy be loatra azafady.
You are not.	Ianao no tsy izany.
I had an idea.	Nanana hevitra aho.
It takes years and years.	Mila taona sy taona maro izany.
He is indeed dead.	Efa maty tokoa izy.
Something could happen all at once.	Mety hisy zavatra hitranga indray mandeha.
You work when you want.	Miasa ianao rehefa tianao.
They never met again.	Tsy nihaona intsony izy ireo.
He called to talk to me.	Niantso hiresaka tamiko izy.
He reads the letter.	Mamaky ny taratasy izy.
The story is wrong.	Diso ny tantara.
He loves you too.	Tia anao koa izy.
I will actually be there.	Efa ho eo aho raha ny marina.
The ground looks different from the first.	Ny tany dia toa tsy mitovy amin'ny tamin'ny voalohany.
I could see that he was still angry.	Hitako fa mbola tezitra izy.
There was always the next.	Nisy foana ny manaraka.
Such a method is known.	Fantatra ny fomba toy izany.
Then he does it again.	Dia manao izany indray izy.
He eventually died.	Maty ihany izy tamin’ny farany.
We tried everything.	Nanandrana ny zava-drehetra izahay.
You can read it.	Azonao atao ny mamaky azy io.
It helped more than you know.	Nanampy mihoatra noho ny fantatrao izany.
I have tried and tried.	Efa nanandrana sy nanandrana aho.
The teacher did it for them.	Nanao izany ho azy ireo ny mpampianatra.
It seems too difficult.	Toa sarotra loatra izany.
It will be done.	Ho vita izany.
No children were playing anywhere.	Tsy nisy ankizy nilalao na taiza na taiza.
He still does.	Mbola manao izany izy.
It seemed full, almost full of people.	Toa feno, saika feno olona.
Not that he is free.	Tsy hoe afaka izy.
I'm sorry you're not happy today.	Miala tsiny aho fa tsy faly ianao androany.
I love watching you play.	Tiako ny mijery anao milalao.
It gets me.	Mahazo ahy izany.
It is not clear what happened.	Tsy mazava tsara ny zava-nitranga.
All women.	Ny vehivavy rehetra.
He stepped out the door and stopped when he spoke again.	Nivoaka ny varavarana izy ary nijanona rehefa niteny indray izy.
I love you, you know that.	Tiako ianao, fantatrao izany.
Only one thing is certain.	Zavatra iray ihany no azo antoka.
They were about to enter.	Saika hiditra izy ireo.
He had not slept for a long time.	Efa ela izy no tsy natory.
You can stay as long as you like.	Afaka mijanona mandritra ny fotoana tianao ianao.
Of course, too early, not too late.	Mazava ho azy fa aloha loatra, tsy dia be.
These are small and fun.	Kely sy mahafinaritra ireo.
He knows them personally.	Fantany manokana izy ireo.
They bring problems.	Mitondra olana izy ireo.
Thank you very much.	Misaotra betsaka.
I could not walk.	Tsy afaka nandeha aho.
Evil was not in the picture.	Tsy teo amin'ny sary ny ratsy.
That day is not far away.	Tsy lavitra io andro io.
They had no jobs.	Tsy nanana asa izy ireo.
Anyway, thank you.	Na izany na tsy izany, misaotra.
We do not need these letters.	Tsy mila ireo taratasy ireo izahay.
It really is.	Tena izany.
Too much.	Betsaka loatra.
It was a child.	Dia zaza iray izany.
It was wrong at first.	Diso ilay izy tamin'ny voalohany.
I don’t care about work.	Tsy miraharaha ny asa aho.
I have known this for a long time.	Efa ela no fantatro izany.
Nothing is done.	Tsy misy ny vita.
And he was very happy to be with me.	Ary tena faly izy niaraka tamiko.
I decided to get out.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hivoaka aho.
Yes, we eat too much food.	Eny, mihinana sakafo be loatra izahay.
It’s almost too much of a story.	Saika be loatra ny tantara iray.
There are a lot of good players in it.	Betsaka ny mpilalao tsara ao aminy.
I have money.	Vola ny ahy.
Without a word he got into the car.	Tsy nisy teny akory dia niditra tao anaty fiara izy.
He started talking, then stopped.	Nanomboka niteny izy, dia nijanona.
He may also have been afraid.	Natahotra koa angamba izy.
We hope they get better.	Manantena izahay fa ho tsara kokoa izy ireo.
I'm not going down the road.	Tsy mandeha amin'ny lalana aho.
And they both went.	Dia nandeha izy roa.
So paddle.	Ka hoe.
It is still early in the morning.	Mbola vao maraina ny andro.
Can anyone help me in a better way?	Misy afaka manampy ahy amin'ny fomba tsara kokoa ve?
People love me.	Tia ahy ny olona.
It didn't happen.	Tsy nitranga izany.
A lot of people go to work now.	Betsaka ny olona mandeha miasa amin'izao fotoana izao.
Now he is interested.	Ankehitriny dia liana izy.
There is something to be done about it.	Misy zavatra tokony hatao momba izany.
They seem to be everywhere.	Toa teny rehetra teny izy ireo.
Longer.	Lava kokoa.
You have to do it.	Tsy maintsy manao izany ianao.
And it is certainly true.	Ary marina tokoa izany.
Not in the first place.	Tsy tamin’ny voalohany.
I’m not the only one watching now.	Tsy izaho irery no mijery izao.
This is the first.	Ity no voalohany.
That's all I am.	Izay ihany aho.
And it was great for him.	Dia lehibe ho azy izany.
For thou didst it unto me.	Fa nataonao tamiko izany.
It slept well.	Natory tsara ilay izy.
Let's go without us.	Aleo mandeha tsy misy anay.
It’s a little better than the last.	Somary tsara kokoa noho ny farany izy io.
That seems too long if you ask me.	Toa lava be izany raha manontany ahy ianao.
Only one can help.	Iray ihany no afaka manampy.
What does he know ?.	Inona no fantany?.
Even a little.	Na kely aza.
Old friends are gone.	Lasa ny namana taloha.
I have been there.	Efa tany aho.
I want to do something else.	Te hanao zavatra hafa aho.
I'll just be honest with you.	Ho marina aminao fotsiny aho.
He said it was hard to stop his new car.	Nilaza izy fa sarotra ny nijanona ny fiarany vaovao.
A lot of that last year.	Betsaka ny tamin'ny taona lasa.
No problem there.	Tsy misy olana any.
But in fact, it never went away.	Saingy raha ny marina dia tsy niala mihitsy izany.
And you should know mine.	Ary tokony ho fantatrao ny ahy.
No one was anywhere.	Tsy nisy olona na taiza na taiza.
The latter method works here.	Ny fomba farany dia mety eto.
Otherwise, it is not.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy izany.
The song is good.	Tsara ny hira.
Here, he had a book.	Eto, nanana boky izy.
It was a great time.	Fotoana be izany.
They will not come yet.	Mbola tsy ho tonga izy ireo.
The man looked tall and handsome.	Nijery lava sy tsara ilay lehilahy.
It is too late.	Efa tara be izao.
Did he hope?	Nanantena ve izy?
I have to check it out.	Tsy maintsy mijery izany aho.
And you don’t have to help me.	Ary tsy voatery hanampy ahy ianao.
Those who need it will not find it.	Ireo izay mila izany dia tsy hahita izany.
This is not a good way.	Tsy fomba tsara izany.
Maybe they’ll know something.	Angamba ho fantany zavatra.
The food is good.	Tsara ny sakafo.
Just to be free.	Mba ho afaka fotsiny.
That should help.	Tokony hanampy izany.
I had never heard of them.	Mbola tsy nandre momba azy ireo mihitsy aho.
He wasn't even sure why he was angry.	Tsy azony antoka akory hoe nahoana izy no tezitra.
I think they are very far away.	Heveriko fa tena lavitra izy ireo.
And of course the future.	Ary mazava ho azy ny ho avy.

What other good ideas ?.	Inona koa no hevitra tsara hafa?.
The women did nothing.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona ny vehivavy.
he wondered.	nanontany tena izy.
I’m already done having problems like this.	Efa vita aho fa manana olana toa izao.
It must have happened to you.	Tsy maintsy ho efa nitranga taminao izany.
I don’t believe there is anyone like him.	Tsy mino aho fa misy toa azy.
And he is alone.	Ary irery izy.
And you are wrong.	Ary diso ianao.
We used to play it when we were little.	Efa nilalao izany izahay fony izahay mbola kely.
You should give them more than that.	Tokony hanome azy ireo mihoatra noho izany ianao.
He never seemed to eat.	Toa tsy nihinana mihitsy izy.
They looked at him, but said nothing.	Nijery azy izy ireo, nefa tsy niteny na inona na inona.
There could have been something else than that.	Mety ho nisy zavatra hafa noho izany.
In two ways.	Amin'ny fomba roa.
I have something to do.	Manana zavatra hatao aho.
It was not easy to go to work today.	Tsy mora ny nandeha niasa androany.
He doesn't know where the top is from.	Tsy fantany hoe avy aiza ilay ambony.
He is afraid of water.	Matahotra ny rano izy.
It took him days and days and days before he died.	Nandany andro sy andro ary andro izy vao maty.
I plan to do it again next year.	Mikasa ny hanao izany indray amin’ny taona ho avy.
Many, many, many.	Maro, maro, maro.
I really like it.	Tena tiako izany.
He is a great man.	Olona ambony izy.
It works really well.	Tena miasa tsara.
This is especially true today, as in previous stories.	Tena marina izany amin'izao fotoana izao, toy ny tamin'ny tantara teo aloha.
For you, any time is right.	Ho anao dia mety ny fotoana rehetra.
The water came.	Tonga ny rano.
I don’t know what it’s like.	Tsy fantatro ny mitovy aminy.
It’s very appropriate.	Tena mety izany.
We have never seen anything like it.	Mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izany izahay.
But you are different.	Fa hafa ianao.
They both provided water.	Samy nanome rano izy ireo.
A little while, then.	Fotoana kely, avy eo.
He seemed happy.	Toa faly izy.
He tried hard.	Niezaka mafy izy.
And he didn't want to go.	Ary tsy te handeha izy.
The woman could not walk.	Tsy afaka nandeha ilay vehivavy.
That used to be good.	Tsara izany taloha.
We just have to stay in the car.	Tsy maintsy mijanona ao anaty fiara fotsiny isika.
And he knew it was me too.	Ary fantany fa izaho koa io.
But he is not the best.	Saingy tsy izy no tsara indrindra.
It should be really good.	Tokony ho tena tsara.
I refused to go with him.	Tsy nety niaraka taminy aho.
He used to live here but no longer lives.	Nipetraka teto izy taloha fa tsy mipetraka intsony.
I hadn’t seen it at the end of the year.	Mbola tsy nahita izany aho tamin'ny faran'ny taona.
But he couldn't give it away now.	Saingy tsy afaka nanome izany izy izao.
In any case, he said more than he should have.	Na ahoana na ahoana, dia niteny mihoatra noho ny tokony ho izy izy.
Just for you.	Ho anao irery.
He is in it.	Izy no eo aminy.
However, we still get them.	Na dia izany aza dia mbola mahazo azy ireo izahay.
It is difficult for me to sleep at home.	Sarotra amiko ny matory ao an-trano.
Surely you wouldn’t tell him.	Azo antoka ve fa tsy hilaza aminy ianao.
No one saw him do that.	Tsy nisy nahita azy nanao izany.
That should be hard.	Tokony ho sarotra izany.
We are in one now.	Ao anatin'ny iray isika izao.
I did something you didn’t like.	Nanao zavatra tsy tianao aho.
He went faster.	Nandeha haingana kokoa izy.
This is the real thing.	Izany no tena izy.
He still needs money for everything.	Mbola mila vola amin'ny zava-drehetra izy.
I had to know who did it.	Tsy maintsy fantatro hoe iza no nanao izany.
He also said that there is a reason for everything.	Nilaza koa izy fa misy antony ny zava-drehetra.
I know you don’t care about money.	Fantatro fa tsy miraharaha ny vola ianao.
I got an idea.	Nahazo hevitra aho.

This is not good.	Tsy tsara izany.
He often enjoyed talking to her.	Matetika izy no tia niresaka taminy.
Don’t be surprised.	Aza gaga.
The same is true today.	Toy izany koa ny amin’izao andro izao.
I'll meet you before the weekend.	Hihaona aminao aho alohan'ny faran'ny herinandro.
I know a little bit.	Somary fantatro ihany.
He knew he couldn't win.	Fantany fa tsy afaka handresy izy.
We are here, and we will stay here.	Eto izahay, ary hijanona eto.
You kids can stay and sit there.	Afaka mijanona sy mipetraka ao ianareo ankizy.
Also in the car.	Ao anaty fiara koa.
I thought there was something.	Nihevitra aho fa misy zavatra.
The next day the night follows the next day the night.	Ny andro manaraka ny alina dia manaraka ny andro manaraka ny alina.
It will never be easy.	Tsy ho mora mihitsy izany.
He was even happy.	Faly mihitsy aza izy.
One came out yesterday.	Nivoaka omaly ny iray.
And maybe he was.	Ary angamba nisy izy.
No one seems to know the real reason.	Toa tsy misy mahalala ny tena antony.
He played really well during the week.	Tena nilalao tsara izy nandritra ny herinandro.
He was sure he had never seen it before.	Azony antoka fa mbola tsy nahita an’io mihitsy izy.
But the night is his favorite time.	Fa ny alina no fotoana tiany indrindra.
If you don't know.	Raha tsy fantatrao.
It will be a good day.	Ho tsara io andro io.
He always had food.	Nanana sakafo foana izy.
And that’s hard.	Ary dia sarotra izany.
I don't know what caused it.	Tsy haiko izay nahatonga izany.
I just love it.	Tiako fotsiny izany.
Maybe he's still waiting for that.	Mbola miandry an’izany angamba izy.
No one is happy here.	Tsy misy olona faly eto.
We need both.	Mila azy roa isika.
Maybe too much.	Be loatra angamba.
I did swim.	Nataoko milomano.
But it’s still fun.	Fa mbola mahafinaritra.
I should be able to do it now.	Tokony ho vitako izao.
I don't need them here yet.	Tsy mbola mila azy ireo eto.

Maybe that’s not the best way to do it.	Angamba tsy izany no fomba tsara indrindra hanaovana izany.

It was completely gone.	Niala tanteraka ilay izy.

He is not ready for that.	Tsy vonona amin’izany izy.
A few hours ago.	Ora vitsivitsy lasa izay.
I came back for that.	Niverina aho noho izany.
He thought so.	Nieritreritra izany izy.
Easy to walk.	Mora ny mandeha.
If they do, it’s good for you.	Raha manao izany izy ireo dia tsara ho anao.
I really like real food.	Tena tiako ny tena sakafo.
We don’t do that now.	Tsy manao an'izany izahay izao.
It may be small.	Mety ho kely izany.
And.	Ary.

It was his last night.	Io no alina farany nataony.
They are the same age.	Mitovy taona izy ireo.
She is happy.	Faly izy.
So, good for them too !.	Noho izany, tsara ho azy ireo koa!.

Everyone is happy.	Faly ny rehetra.
We had a great time.	Nanana fotoana tsara izahay.
Maybe too strong.	Mahery loatra angamba.
I didn’t think it would go that far.	Tsy noheveriko ho lasa lavitra izany.

Of course he liked it.	Mazava ho azy fa tiany izany.
This is not entirely true, but it will suffice.	Tsy marina tanteraka izany, fa ho ampy izany.
You are too small.	Kely loatra ianao.
Most likely they will.	Azo inoana fa hanao izany izy ireo.
I don't know what the problem would be.	Tsy haiko izay mety ho olana.
He had a lot of questions.	Nanana fanontaniana be dia be izy.
The location is perfect.	Tena mety ny toerana.
I know it's mine.	Fantatro fa ny ahy.
But he can't.	Saingy tsy afaka izy.
I'll be right out.	Hivoaka avy hatrany aho.
They will help him.	Hanampy azy izy ireo.
I made the picture for him.	Nataoko taminy ilay sary.
There is news as well.	Misy vaovao koa.
You know the earth.	Fantatrao ny tany.
It seems to be going well right now.	Toa mandeha tsara amin'izao fotoana izao.
That is the real problem here.	Izany no tena olana eto.
It’s a little time consuming.	Fotoana kely izy.
I got out of the way.	Niala tamin'ny lalana aho.
They went to work.	Nandeha niasa izy ireo.
It doesn’t exist and probably never will.	Tsy misy izany ary mety tsy hisy mihitsy.
None of us did that.	Tsy nisy nanao izany izahay.
But we don’t have to be these people.	Saingy tsy voatery ho ireo olona ireo isika.
I know that very well.	Fantatro tsara izany.
So here’s the thing.	Ka izao no zavatra.
I wonder if you will grow up like them.	Manontany tena aho raha ho lehibe toa azy ireo ianao.
It can be fun.	Mety ho mahafinaritra izany.
They’re kind of different.	Karazana karazana izy ireo.
Because we are.	Satria izahay no.
He wants to leave, but can't.	Te hiala izy, saingy tsy afaka.
Instead, he made a serious mistake.	Nanao fahadisoana lehibe kosa izy.
He is very skilled.	Tena mahay izy.
Often at the same time.	Matetika amin'ny fotoana iray ihany.
I also have to remember who did it to him.	Tsy maintsy tadidiko koa hoe iza no nanao izany taminy.
You might say.	Mety hilaza ianao.
That’s exactly what he likes.	Izany indrindra no tiany.
It hasn’t accomplished anything yet.	Tsy mbola nahavita na inona na inona.
He was immediately confused.	Tonga dia very hevitra izy.
He was wrong again.	Diso indray izy.
Not a single one was lost.	Tsy nisy very na dia iray aza.
Nothing good was ever done.	Tsy nisy zavatra tsara mihitsy.
That seems wrong.	Toa diso izany.
Which of course.	Izay mazava ho azy.
No one could come back to him.	Tsy nisy afaka niverina taminy.
I have money.	Manana vola aho.
You have to do this before you leave the house.	Tsy maintsy manao izany ianao alohan'ny hivoaka ny trano.
I never wanted children.	Tsy naniry ankizy mihitsy aho.
There was no such person.	Tsy nisy olona toy izany.
i really do.	tena manao izany aho.
Otherwise, not bad.	Raha tsy izany, tsy ratsy.
Big mistake.	Fahadisoana lehibe.
You need to know what it is.	Mila mahafantatra ianao hoe inona izany.
And he did so.	Dia nanao izany izy.
Because he was somewhere.	Satria teto tany ho any izy.
Instead, they carry it.	Mitondra izany kosa izy ireo.
Don’t worry about it.	Aza manahy momba izany ianao.
Such a beautiful house.	Trano tsara tarehy toy izany.
It’s about time, too.	Momba ny fotoana koa.
Kids can get it, and that’s a problem.	Afaka mahazo izany ny ankizy, ary olana izany.
Which of course he is.	Izay mazava ho azy fa izy.
Here is the first problem.	Eto dia misy ny olana voalohany.
I like the same thing.	Tiako ny zavatra mitovy.
You can help me more.	Afaka manampy ahy bebe kokoa ianao.
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
The weather is good and there aren't many people yet.	Tsara ny andro ary mbola tsy betsaka ny olona.
I always am.	Foana aho.
It has to go a long way.	Tsy maintsy lasa lavitra.
Of course, this is the wrong way to go.	Mazava ho azy fa diso lalana izany.
You should have heard that.	Tokony ho nandre izany ianao.
Yes, you can just walk.	Eny, afaka mandeha fotsiny ianao.
But you don't seem to be happy about it.	Saingy toa tsy faly amin'izany akory ianao.
I know who it is.	Fantatro hoe iza io.
A few ideas.	Hevitra vitsivitsy.
But he had no better idea.	Saingy tsy nanana hevitra tsara kokoa izy.
I shouldn't drive.	Tsy tokony hitondra fiara aho.
He hurried to the car.	Nandeha haingana nankany amin’ilay fiara izy.
He saw nothing.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona izy.
I don't understand how.	Tsy azoko hoe ahoana.
Many people have learned about it the hard way.	Olona maro no nianatra momba izany tamin'ny fomba sarotra.
I make up my mind not to look at it.	Manao hevitra aho mba tsy hijery azy.
To my surprise, time passed so quickly.	Gaga aho fa nandeha haingana ny fotoana.
I would love to be with you.	Tiako ny hiaraka amiko.
And, we’re looking at another long day today.	Ary, mijery andro lava iray hafa isika anio.
They didn't see one.	Tsy nahita na dia iray aza izy ireo.
The room was as good as the people working there.	Tsara toy ny olona niasa tao ny efitrano.
And often, they won’t.	Ary matetika, tsy hanao izany izy ireo.
It’s not us.	Tsy izahay izany.
The waiting time passed quickly.	Nandeha haingana ny fotoana niandry.
What is for sure.	Inona no azo antoka.
Or with him.	Na amin'ny azy.
Those days seem to be back.	Toa niverina ireo andro ireo.
Maybe even today.	Angamba na dia amin’izao andro izao aza.
Not good, but easy.	Tsy tsara, fa mora.
You weren’t really scared.	Tsy tena natahotra ianao.
It was very difficult for me.	Tena sarotra tamiko izany.
And we couldn’t blame him.	Ary tsy afaka nanome tsiny izahay.
They wanted something.	Naniry zavatra izy ireo.
And so it is.	Ary toy izany koa izy.
In this room.	Ao amin'ity efitrano ity.
It will take you to a safe place.	Hitondra anao any amin'ny toerana azo antoka izany.
But we don’t have it here or anyone else.	Saingy tsy manana azy eto izahay na ny hafa.
Not so before.	Tsy toy izany taloha.
We need to talk more about that.	Mila miresaka bebe kokoa momba izany isika.
Then he left.	Dia lasa izy avy eo.
But that's not right.	Saingy tsy mety izany.
It’s a completely different man.	Lehilahy hafa tanteraka izany.
Another thing he didn’t understand.	Zavatra iray hafa tsy azony.
They will not come.	Tsy ho avy izy ireo.
They were waiting for us.	Niandry anay izy ireo.
He shouldn't have been there for us.	Tsy tokony ho nisy anay teo izy.
It’s hard to see him go.	Sarotra ny mahita azy handeha.
Hope to see them once.	Manantena ny hahita azy ireo indray mandeha.
I didn’t want anyone anymore.	Tsy naniry olona intsony aho.
I needed water.	Nila rano aho.
He did not say that.	Tsy nilaza izany izy.
But it looks like someone is already in his room.	Saingy toa efa misy olona ao amin'ny efitranony.
So you have to play at your best.	Noho izany dia tsy maintsy milalao amin'ny tsara indrindra ianao.
I can walk alone.	Afaka mandeha irery aho.
It already has.	Efa nisy izany.
He talked about it.	Niresaka momba izany izy.
I see it almost every day.	Saika isan'andro aho no mahita azy.
And there you are wrong.	Ary eo no diso ianao.
It's all bad.	Ratsy daholo izany.
He needed her.	Nila azy izy.
It was wrong.	Tsy nety teo izany.
But one thing seems plausible.	Saingy zavatra iray no toa azo inoana.
As long as he wants to.	Raha mbola tiany.
He will soon find out.	Tsy ho ela dia ho fantany izany.
Maybe, maybe more.	Mety, mety ho bebe kokoa.
That is true.	Marina izany.
The first rain was non -existent.	Ny orana aloha dia tsy nisy.
I worked hard.	Niasa mafy aho.
I'm too busy.	Be atao loatra aho.
That's how he is.	Toy izany izy.
You have to know first.	Tokony ho fantatra aloha ianao.
You couldn't stop.	Tsy afaka nijanona ianao.
Of course, they don’t completely give up.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy miala tanteraka izy ireo.
Here is the question.	Ity ny fanontaniana.
That won't be a problem for me.	Tsy ho olana amiko izany.
You won’t find someone who loves everything you want.	Tsy hahita olona tia izay rehetra tianao ianao.
I asked for help.	Nangataka fanampiana aho.
It didn't happen in a day and it wasn't easy.	Tsy nitranga tao anatin’ny iray andro izany ary tsy mora izany.
I did not see.	Tsy nahita aho.
I love him and never play him.	Tiako izy ary tsy milalao azy mihitsy.
And they were fun.	Ary nahafinaritra azy ireo.
He will be there again this year.	Ho any indray izy amin’ity taona ity.
You can get students and it will be your cause.	Afaka mahazo mpianatra ianao ary ho antony anao.
I was not afraid.	Tsy natahotra aho.
These two things are very much the same.	Tena iray ihany ireo zavatra roa ireo.
I looked around before I saw this man.	Nijery tanteraka aho vao nahita an'io lehilahy io.
It was him again.	Izy indray izany.
Two worked, and many more may have stayed.	Roa no niasa, ary mety ho maro kokoa no nijanona.
Nothing happened by chance.	Tsy nisy tonga ho azy.
Without them, this would not have happened.	Raha tsy nisy azy ireo dia tsy ho nitranga izany.
Everyone stopped to watch.	Nijanona nijery ny rehetra.
And we do.	Ary manao izany izahay.
He could have done it.	Afaka nanao izany izy.
And you know us.	Ary fantatrao izahay.
He arrived late, so he could not find the best place.	Tara izy vao tonga, ka tsy nahita ny toerana tsara indrindra.
He could still see her.	Mbola afaka nahita azy izy.
I fell in love with him.	Lasa tia azy aho.
Yes, beautiful.	Eny, tsara tarehy.
You are asleep now.	Matory ianao izao.
I never thought you would do that.	Tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe hanao izany ianao.
There are no two ways about it.	Tsy misy fomba roa momba izany.
The baby is now asleep.	Matory izao ilay zaza.
There are no books to talk about.	Tsy misy boky miresaka.
We need new ideas.	Mila hevitra vaovao isika.
It’s a complete disaster.	Loza tanteraka izany .
He hopes to add a lot of money.	Manantena izy fa hanampy ny vola be.
They better not drink it.	Aleo tsy misotro an'io izy ireo.
He just couldn’t leave now.	Tsy afaka niala fotsiny izy izao.
He never knew why.	Tsy fantany mihitsy hoe nahoana.
I thought it might be.	Nihevitra aho fa mety ho izy io.
I am often alone.	Izaho irery ihany matetika.
It is necessary to know one.	Ilaina ny mahafantatra ny iray.
We lost everything.	Very ny zava-drehetra izahay.
They seemed to say.	Toa nilaza izy ireo.
He said he wanted me to have a party for him.	Nilaza izy fa tiany hanao fety ho azy aho.
Everything is very clear.	Mazava tanteraka ny zava-drehetra.
When he saw you outside.	Rehefa nahita anao tany ivelany izy.
He was not surprised.	Tsy gaga izy.
He looked at the big man.	Nijery ilay lehilahy lehibe izy.
They asked me what happened.	Nanontany ahy izy ireo hoe inona no nitranga.
I didn’t think he was really going to.	Tsy noheveriko fa handeha tokoa izy.
We both do everything.	Samy manao ny zava-drehetra izahay.
I'm sure there's nothing in it.	Azoko antoka fa tsy misy na inona na inona ao.
I'm not sure why it's not working.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe nahoana izy io no tsy mandeha.
He slept through the night.	Natory nandritra ny alina izy.
We will be back !.	Mbola hiverina izahay!.
It was not necessary.	Tsy nila izany.
We don’t need money this month.	Tsy mila vola izahay amin'ity volana ity.
He is a strong swimmer.	Mahery milomano izy.
We would be in trouble if we didn’t.	Ho sahirana isika raha tsy nanao izany.
It looks really good.	Toa tena tsara.
Say you will.	Lazao fa hanao izany ianao.
The big thing.	Ny zavatra lehibe.
He needs to stay sick.	Mila mijanona izy fa marary.
Not before, and not now.	Tsy taloha, ary tsy ankehitriny.
The first good.	Ny tsara voalohany.
He can't see you.	Tsy mety mahita anao izy.
The question is what to do about it.	Ny fanontaniana dia hoe inona no tokony hatao amin'izany.
I like that.	Tiako izany.
Nothing big, nothing big.	Tsy misy lehibe, tsy misy lehibe.
This is mine.	Ity ny ahy.
We didn’t stay long.	Tsy nijanona ela izahay.
Says to bring only one man.	Milaza ny hitondra lehilahy iray ihany.
The house is small.	Kely ny trano.
But of course that is not possible.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy azo atao izany.
When he got home, he didn’t stay long.	Rehefa tonga tany an-trano izy dia tsy nijanona ela.
It's done.	Vita izany.
I hope you understand.	Manantena aho fa azonao.
He waited, for sure.	Niandry izy, azo antoka.
He can't do anything.	Tsy afaka manao na inona na inona izy.
I'm really good at it.	Tena mahay an'io aho.
I can do this job easily.	Afaka manao izany asa izany mora foana aho.
So time is not necessarily for me.	Ka tsy voatery ho ahy ny fotoana.
I haven't bought it yet.	Mbola tsy nividy izany aho.
We also get the letter.	Mahazo ny taratasy koa izahay.
I need to learn more about this stuff.	Mila mianatra bebe kokoa momba an'io zavatra io aho.
For yourself to be very honest.	Ho an'ny tena ho tena marina.
It’s too hard to say.	Sarotra loatra ny nilaza izany.
So he must have been here before.	Ka tsy maintsy efa teto izy taloha.
But it really did exist.	Saingy tena nisy tokoa izany.
That is, if you like him.	Izany hoe raha tianao izy.
It's nice to talk to you.	Mahafinaritra ny miresaka aminao.
Not because it’s early in the morning.	Tsy hoe satria vao maraina.
My teacher didn't seem to know why either.	Toa tsy fantatry ny mpampianatra ahy koa ny antony.
And about that.	Ary ny momba izany.
Breakfast, in your opinion, should be the first meal.	Ny sakafo maraina, araka ny hevitrao, no tokony ho sakafo voalohany.
However, there is a problem with that.	Na izany aza, misy olana amin'izany.
The same clothes arrived.	Tonga ny akanjo mitovy.
They never met him.	Tsy nihaona taminy mihitsy izy ireo.
I really need to talk to him.	Tena mila miresaka aminy aho.
You buy, buy, buy.	Hividy ianao, hividy, hividy.
But we have a lot of time together.	Saingy manana fotoana betsaka miaraka izahay.
He, in fact.	Izy, raha ny marina.
He has been there for a long time.	Efa ela izy no tao.
Now, on to the problem itself.	Ankehitriny, amin'ny olana mihitsy.
I'm happier with that.	Faly kokoa aho amin'izany.
You are very safe right now.	Tena azo antoka ianao amin'izao fotoana izao.
And so it is.	Ary toy izany ihany koa.
You can do the same.	Afaka manao izany koa ianao.
Method.	Fomba.
Like nothing happened.	Toy ny tsy nisy na inona na inona.
This is indeed true.	Marina tokoa izany.
There are many.	Betsaka ireo.
Yes, you get the idea.	Eny, azonao ny hevitra.
And there’s nothing you can do about it.	Ary tsy misy zavatra azonao atao momba izany.
However, these two things may be the cause.	Na izany aza, ireo zavatra roa ireo dia mety ho antony.
I need many hours a day.	Mila ora maro isan'andro aho.
He understood, because he knew me well.	Azony tsara, satria fantany tsara aho.
No one asked me one.	Tsy nisy nanontany ahy na dia iray aza.
If you want to do that, fine.	Raha te hanao izany ianao dia tsara.
No, we are alone.	Tsia, irery isika.
He had time to do it.	Nanana fotoana hanaovana izany izy.
We sat for no reason.	Nipetraka tsy nisy antony izahay.
He was the only one in the house with her.	Izy irery no tao an-trano niaraka taminy.
It was so easy.	Tena mora ilay izy.
It's worse now.	Ratsy kokoa izao.
However, it will always be.	Na izany aza dia ho foana izany.
It could be a week or three weeks.	Mety ho herinandro na telo herinandro izany.
I'm sure someone will get it.	Azoko antoka fa hisy olona hahazo izany.
You are just wrong.	Diso fotsiny ianao.
It’s not that they’re bad.	Tsy hoe ratsy izy ireo.
I am that person.	Izaho io olona io.
Eventually, he will be gone.	Farany, dia ho lasa izy.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Raha tsy anio, rahampitso, tsy ho ela.
And they wondered why.	Ary nanontany tena izy ireo hoe nahoana.
Wait two hours.	Miandry adiny roa.
You did not eat.	Tsy nihinana ianao.
This house is not far from it.	Tsy lavitra an’io io trano io.
We always talked about him.	Niresaka momba azy foana izahay.
He studied it well.	Nianatra azy tsara izy.
Upcoming photos.	Sary ho avy.
He is not a teacher, but a teacher.	Tsy mpampianatra izy, fa mpampianatra.
I think both are true.	Heveriko fa samy marina izy roa.
We hope for the best.	Manantena ny tsara indrindra izahay.
And no one did anything about it.	Ary tsy nisy nanao na inona na inona momba izany.
This is what really happened.	Izany no tena nitranga.
We can’t have one without you.	Tsy afaka manana iray izahay raha tsy misy anao.
It really scared me.	Tena natahotra ahy izany.
He is neither happy nor unhappy.	Tsy faly izy na tsy faly.
He decided to stay.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hijanona izy.
I just looked at him.	Nijery azy fotsiny aho.
This is bad news.	Vaovao ratsy izany.
We think it works well.	Mihevitra izahay fa miasa tsara izany.
However, he could not.	Na izany aza, tsy afaka izy.
That’s a good idea.	Hevitra tsara izany.
He called as soon as he saw her.	Niantso avy hatrany izy raha vao nahita azy.
It could be something completely different as well.	Mety ho zavatra hafa tanteraka koa izany.
All of you.	Ianareo rehetra.
Certainly there is.	Azo antoka fa misy izany.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.
He looks at me dead.	Mijery ahy maty izy.
It will be a good time !.	Ho fotoana tsara!.
The trip is too much for you.	Be loatra ho anao ny dia.
This will tell you if you can.	Izany no hilaza aminao raha mety ianao.
You won’t understand about it.	Tsy ho azonao ny momba izany.
You can stay.	Afaka mijanona ianao.
It was too late to ask him.	Tara loatra vao nanontany azy.
So it doesn’t go either.	Ka tsy mandeha koa.
It’s easier to read.	Mora kokoa ny mamaky azy io.
He had always thought so, but now he was sure.	Nieritreritra izany foana izy, saingy izao dia azony antoka.
Eventually the truth will come out.	Amin'ny farany dia hivoaka ny marina.
Not the first time.	Tsy vao voalohany.
But time will tell !.	Fa ny fotoana tokoa no hilaza!.
Then it started.	Dia nanomboka izany.
He does it every day.	Manao izany isan’andro izy.
I had to learn to live.	Tsy maintsy nianatra ny ho velona aho.
We lived in a house.	Nipetraka tao amin’ny trano iray izahay.
You just know it.	Fantatrao fotsiny izany.
Because he knew.	Satria fantany.
Of course he will.	Mazava ho azy fa hanao izany izy.
The same problem lies here.	Mitovy ny olana mipetraka eto.
They were just fun.	Nahafinaritra fotsiny izy ireo.
I hope you are happy.	Manantena aho fa faly ianao.
He managed not to.	Nahavita tsy nanao izany izy.
Many others follow.	Manaraka izany ny maro hafa.
However, it can’t be that bad.	Na izany aza, tsy mety ho ratsy izany.
That’s probably the worst thing.	Izany angamba no zavatra ratsy indrindra.
There were people.	Nisy olona.
Thank you so much!	Misaotra anao indrindra!
The man is crazy.	Adala ilay lehilahy.
Not to him.	Tsy aminy.
I don’t want to be big.	Tsy te ho lehibe aho.
It’s not just today.	Tsy androany ihany izany.
No one is too happy.	Tsy misy faly loatra.
It helps us in two ways.	Manampy antsika amin'ny fomba roa izany.
I wondered if he was one.	Nanontany tena aho raha iray izy.
I can't even eat.	Tsy afaka mihinana akory aho.
So, you know you’re a little surprised.	Noho izany, fantatrao fa somary gaga ianao.
I had a great time.	Nanana fotoana mahafinaritra aho.
Maybe he will come tomorrow.	Angamba ho avy izy rahampitso.
It's too close.	Efa akaiky loatra izany.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.
That must be it.	Tsy maintsy izay no izy.
The word is clear, for him and for everyone.	Mazava ny teny, ho azy sy ho an’ny rehetra.
They always ask what they can do for me.	Manontany foana izy ireo hoe inona no azony atao amiko.
Nothing happened.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona nitranga.
I didn’t ask him why.	Tsy nanontany azy aho hoe nahoana.
Then they will come back to me.	Dia hiverina ho ahy izy ireo.
He said a few words and left.	Nilaza teny vitsivitsy izy ary lasa nandeha.
Either we, or.	Na isika, na.
Not enough people.	Tsy ampy ny olona.
Anyway, got in.	Na ahoana na ahoana dia niditra.
That’s a really good idea.	Tena hevitra tsara izany.
You are strong.	Mahery ianao.
Some women still do it.	Misy vehivavy mbola manao izany.
He knew it, but he was still waiting outside.	Fantany izany, nefa mbola niandry teo ivelany ihany izy.
Is he.	Izy ve.
He said he couldn't help it.	Nilaza izy fa tsy afaka manampy azy.
I have tried everything.	Efa nanandrana ny zava-drehetra.
We still have it.	Mbola manana izany isika.
I don't understand.	Tsy azoko.
And it should be easy.	Ary tokony ho mora izany.
He just doesn’t know where.	Tsy fantany fotsiny hoe aiza.
You read everything.	Mamaky ny zava-drehetra ianao.
Of course, people can be wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa mety ho diso ny olona.
You will be coming soon.	Ho avy tsy ho ela ianao.
There are, of course, many more.	Misy, mazava ho azy, betsaka kokoa.
That is no longer the case.	Tsy izany intsony no nitranga.
It’s a lot of fun.	Mahafinaritra ny mahafinaritra.
Like me.	Toy ny aho.
And here we stay.	Ary eto izahay hijanona.
Of course, he doesn’t have that kind of luck.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy manana vintana toy izany izy.
It doesn’t exist without it.	Tsy misy izany raha tsy misy azy.
It’s a place with no space.	Toerana tsy misy toerana izy io.
They love their children.	Tia ny zanany izy ireo.
Of course, that was wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy nety izany.
Often.	Matetika.
I know you never got that.	Fantatro fa tsy nahazo izany mihitsy ianao.
But others can.	Fa ny hafa afaka.
They only make their favorite music.	Izy ireo ihany no manao ny mozika tiany.
Work on a specific frequency.	Miasa amin'ny matetika manokana.
I really like them.	Tena tiako izy ireo.
He lived alone in a small house.	Nipetraka irery tao amin’ny trano kely iray izy.
Those at their best will do nothing.	Ireo amin'ny tsara indrindra dia tsy hanao na inona na inona.
No other words needed.	Tsy misy teny hafa ilaina.
I don't know him very well.	Tsy fantatro tsara izy.
It had to go.	Tsy maintsy nandeha izany.
Not to be missed.	Mba tsy ho azo.
In fact, it is not.	Raha ny marina dia tsy izany.
Then go if possible.	Dia mandeha raha azo atao.
And so will you.	Ary ho toy izany koa ianao.
Don’t work hard.	Aza miasa mafy.
Not when he made us into it.	Tsy rehefa izy no nahatonga antsika ho amin'izany.
No one works for sure.	Tsy misy miasa azo antoka.
Maybe that’s asking too much.	Sao dia manontany be loatra izany.
I love them.	Tiako izy ireo.
But we can’t have that.	Saingy tsy afaka manana izany isika.
I just talked about it.	Niresaka an'io fotsiny aho.
I just looked.	Nijery fotsiny aho.
You shouldn’t leave early.	Tsy tokony hiala aloha ianao.
He should be the same.	Tokony ho toy izany koa izy.
Only you can see it.	Ianao ihany no mahita izany.
It could be both.	Mety ho izy roa.
There is a house	Misy trano
They probably gave us music.	Azo inoana fa nanome mozika anay izy ireo.
Not a little.	Tsy kely akory.
He told me and was always right.	Nilaza tamiko izy ary marina foana.
And we are not dead.	Ary tsy maty izahay.
He’s playing a woman.	Milalao vehivavy izy.
It’s a bit difficult.	Somary sarotra izany.
I'll know if you tell him.	Ho fantatro raha milaza aminy ianao.
And yet, she never had a man.	Ary na izany aza, tsy nanana lehilahy mihitsy izy.
And he had friends.	Ary nanana namana izy.
So, people die, die.	Noho izany, ny olona dia maty, maty.
It’s big, ugly, and irresistible.	Lehibe izy io, ratsy tarehy, ary tsy mety miala.
I wonder who.	Manontany tena aho hoe iza.
I thought they would go it alone.	Nihevitra aho fa handeha irery izy ireo.
It will get better.	Ho lasa tsara kokoa.
The same thing could have happened to a man.	Toy izany koa no mety ho nitranga tamin’ny lehilahy iray.
It’s not completely stupid to think.	Tsy adala tanteraka ny mieritreritra.
It was not difficult to find people.	Tsy sarotra ny nahita olona.
The future is here.	Eo ny ho avy.
Mine is even better.	Ny ahy dia mbola tsara kokoa.
That is, there is something wrong with it.	Izany hoe misy tsy mety amin'izany.
He did it for me.	Nataony ho ahy izany.
Of course, they are absolutely right.	Mazava ho azy fa marina tanteraka izy ireo.
I know you believe me.	Fantatro fa mino ahy ianao.
However, he was happy.	Na izany aza, dia faly izy.
However, we didn’t get along very well.	Na izany aza, tsy dia tsara loatra izahay niaraka.
That's all I'll do.	Izay ihany no hataoko.
And even that may not be enough.	Ary na dia izany aza dia mety tsy ho ampy.
I just love about it.	Tiako fotsiny ny momba izany.
But not in the room.	Fa tsy ao amin'ny efitrano.
If you try hard, it's easy to miss things.	Mora ny tsy mahita zavatra, raha miezaka mafy ianao.
None of these men have, or will give.	Tsy misy manana na iray aza amin’ireo lehilahy ireo, na hanome izany.
He does nothing to help.	Tsy manao na inona na inona hanampy izy.
He did nothing for me.	Nanao na inona na inona ho ahy izy.
I am very happy.	Tena faly aho.
I think there must be a mistake.	Heveriko fa tsy maintsy misy fahadisoana.
They’re just a little fun.	Mahafinaritra kely fotsiny izy ireo.
It’s absolutely solid.	Mafy tanteraka ilay izy.
That is what should happen.	Izany no tokony hitranga.
The dead man.	Ilay lehilahy maty.
I'm used to working nights.	Efa zatra miasa alina aho.
Which, in fact, is the same.	Izay, raha ny marina, dia mitovy.
One minute, there you are.	Iray minitra, teo ianao.
No one had a real chance to find a job.	Tsy nisy olona nanana fahafahana tena hahita asa.
It is to the end.	Dia hatramin'ny farany.
He really made himself last.	Tena nanao ny tenany ho farany izy.
I had never thought of that before.	Mbola tsy nieritreritra an'izany mihitsy aho.
He became angry.	Lasa tezitra izy.
He refused to apologize.	Tsy nety niala tsiny izy.
We will all go.	Handeha isika rehetra.
Any man is fun.	Na inona na inona lehilahy dia mahafinaritra.
He kept trying.	Mbola nanandrana ihany izy.
I couldn’t go back to that.	Tsy afaka niverina tamin'izany aho.
It seems like the happy times are still far away.	Toa mbola lavitra ny fotoana nahafinaritra.
Then that work is done.	Dia vita izany asa izany.
And that's it.	Ary izany no izy.
He wondered now.	Nanontany tena izy izao.
That was enough for him.	Efa ampy azy izany.
What he did was wrong.	Tsy nety ny nataony.
We arrived at the room.	Tonga tao amin’ilay efitrano izahay.
It really helps.	Tena manampy izany.
Little time is lost.	Kely ny fotoana very.
I'm not even scared.	Tsy matahotra akory aho.
So only once.	Ka indray mandeha ihany.

And the time has come.	Ary tonga ny fotoana.
He treats us well here.	Mitondra antsika tsara izy eto.
Everyone wants to talk one last time.	Te hiresaka farany ny rehetra.
Then they kept coming back and asking me to do more.	Avy eo dia niverina foana izy ireo ary nangataka ahy hanao bebe kokoa.
The students got a lot of space.	Nahazo toerana be dia be ny mpianatra.
He doesn't seem happy.	Toa tsy faly izy.
Everything seems to be going well.	Toa mandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
It used to be.	Teo aloha izany.
One, when you did something wrong.	Ny iray, rehefa nanao zavatra tsy nety ianao.

He had to talk to her.	Tsy maintsy niresaka taminy izy.
Did he come back.	Niverina ve izy.
You may be lucky and win.	Mety ho ianao no tsara vintana ary handresy.
But even then, there is a problem.	Saingy na izany aza dia misy olana.
The children were scared.	Natahotra ny ankizy.
Yes, you still have a little time.	Eny, mbola manana fotoana kely ianao.
It was an easy job.	Asa mora ilay izy.
Such a thing may happen to him more than once.	Mety hitranga aminy mihoatra ny indray mandeha ny zavatra toy izany.
They will win his heart.	Hahazo ny fony izy ireo.
I thought that was a good idea.	Nihevitra aho fa hevitra tsara izany.
She was scared.	Natahotra izy.
Didn't look at me once tonight.	Tsy nijery ahy indray mandeha androany alina.
I'm not sure that's true.	Tsy azoko antoka fa marina izany.
For many players, this is especially true.	Ho an'ny mpilalao maro dia marina tokoa izany.
I even liked him.	Nahafinaritra ahy mihitsy aza izy.
It couldn’t be easier !.	Tsy ho mora kokoa izany!.
I went to school.	Nandeha nianatra aho.
Things are different here.	Hafa ny zavatra teto.
The man with her died.	Ilay lehilahy niaraka taminy no maty.
That's enough for me.	Ampy ahy izany.
Let's get some sleep.	Aleo matory kely.
It's not safe here.	Tsy azo antoka ny eto.
Go there.	Mandeha any.
However, this was not the case.	Na izany aza dia tsy nisy izany.
They needed a new teacher.	Nila mpampianatra vaovao izy ireo.
And of course that made me crazy.	Ary mazava ho azy fa nahatonga ahy hanao adala izany.
And it was done.	Ary tanteraka izany.
He can't wait.	Tsy afaka miandry izy.
I told him there would be no more.	Nolazaiko taminy fa tsy hisy intsony.
You have to do that first.	Tokony hanao izany aloha ianao.
That is the right path.	Izany no lalana marina.
Not that he gave anything away.	Tsy hoe nanome na inona na inona izy.
So they are very similar.	Ka tena mitovy izy ireo.
We didn’t say anything, they left.	Tsy niteny izahay, dia lasa izy ireo.
I'm glad to see you.	Faly aho nahita anao.
Now the problem is.	Izao ny olana dia izao.
They are very lucky.	Tena tsara vintana izy ireo.
I refused to go.	Tsy nety nandeha aho.
He looked at her carefully.	Nijery azy tsara izy.
He decided to do it.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hanao izany izy.
We'll get to that in a minute.	Ho tonga amin'izany isika afaka iray minitra.
You really love them.	Tena tia azy ireo ianao.
Maybe they will give you more.	Angamba hanome anao bebe kokoa izy ireo.
This is not new.	Tsy vaovao izany.
Don't eat it.	Aza mihinana azy.
Yes, almost no one.	Eny, saika tsy misy olona.
He arrived late today.	Tara izy tonga androany.
But there was no money then.	Saingy tsy nisy vola tamin'izany.
Could have met better.	Afaka nihaona tsara kokoa.
You shouldn’t have come here.	Tsy tokony ho tonga eto ianao.
Really see that.	Tena mahita izany.
Maybe two or three years.	Mety roa na telo taona.
I had to go there.	Tsy maintsy nandeha tany aho.
But never more than that.	Fa tsy mihoatra izany mihitsy.
We never heard from him again.	Tsy nandre momba azy intsony izahay.
The trip was a lot of fun.	Nahafinaritra be ilay dia.
Everyone loves him.	Samy tia azy ny rehetra.
I'm not completely stupid.	Tsy adala tanteraka aho.
It was like there was a place for me here.	Toy ny nisy toerana ho ahy teto.
I’m sure it will be in a day or two.	Azoko antoka fa ao anatin'ny iray na roa andro izany.
It’s fun again.	Dia mahafinaritra indray.
All the fault is ours.	Ny fahadisoana rehetra dia antsika.
I will help you.	Hanampy anao aho.
Time will tell.	Ny fotoana no hilaza.
It has happened before.	Efa nisy izany taloha.
No matter, no.	Tsia ahoana, tsia.
Better than alive.	Aleo toy izay velona.
The bad news is they didn’t have the good ones.	Ny vaovao ratsy dia tsy nanana ny tsara izy ireo.
To my surprise, the food was delicious.	Gaga aho fa nahafinaritra ny sakafo.
Only one can be obtained.	Iray ihany no mety ho azo.
Her children have grown up.	Efa lehibe ny zanany.
The women hurried out of the room.	Nivoaka haingana ny efitrano ny vehivavy.
Talked to him.	Niresaka taminy.
He still had something to do.	Mbola nanana zavatra hatao izy.
When they saw him.	Rehefa nahita azy izy ireo.
He comes here to see you every day.	Tonga eto izy mba hijery anao isan'andro.
He has no friends.	Tsy manana namana izy.
And with that in mind, it’s a good fit.	Ary raha mieritreritra an'izany, dia mety tsara izany.
Far from anything.	Lavitra na inona na inona.
They never do that, but you never know.	Tsy manao izany mihitsy izy ireo, nefa tsy fantatrao mihitsy.
We went all the way outside to check.	Nivoaka hatrany ivelany izahay mba hijery.
This is not true for larger cars.	Tsy marina izany ho an'ny fiara lehibe kokoa.
It is also uncertain.	Tsy azo antoka koa izany.
They speak loudly because they are afraid of you.	Miteny mafy izy ireo satria matahotra anao.
He seems to be alive.	Toa mbola velona izy.
That's what happened here.	Izany no nitranga teto.
I knew it scared me.	Fantatro fa natahotra ahy izany.
You have enough food.	Efa ampy sakafo ianao.
I read it somewhere.	Namaky izany tany ho any aho.
I’m sure many of these are really good.	Azoko antoka fa maro amin'ireo no tena tsara.
He sat down.	Nipetraka izy.
They didn’t just talk about it.	Tsy niresaka an'izany fotsiny izy ireo.
In many ways.	Amin'ny zavatra maro.
I was absolutely wrong.	Tena tsy nety aho.
I don’t know anything about it.	Tsy haiko na inona na inona momba izany.
I knew it would always be there.	Fantatro fa ho foana ilay izy.
Well, he didn't come in, right.	Eny, tsy niditra izy, marina.
He was wrong and not me.	Izy no diso fa tsy izaho.
Often the problem is too little rain.	Matetika ny olana dia kely loatra ny orana.
It’s not too bad either.	Tsy dia ratsy loatra koa izany.
He, more than anything, was fun.	Izy, mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra, dia nahafinaritra.
They even talked about it.	Niresaka momba izany mihitsy izy ireo.
A lot of people will buy this car in the coming months.	Betsaka ny olona hividy ity fiara ity amin'ny volana ho avy.
There is nothing.	Tsy misy na inona na inona.
Or so it seems.	Na toa izany.
I think we can be better.	Heveriko fa afaka ny ho tsara kokoa isika.
They both have it, whether they like it or not.	Samy manana ihany izy ireo, na tiany na tsy tiany.
You were there, and you were there.	Teo ianao, ary teo koa ianao.
He desperately wanted information.	Naniry mafy hahazo vaovao izy.
This place may be new to you.	Mety hisy vaovao ho anao io toerana io.
What a person.	Olona manao ahoana.
Otherwise, it still works fine.	Raha tsy izany dia mbola mandeha tsara izy io.
Now, it seems to just stay there.	Ankehitriny, toa mijanona eo fotsiny.
He took it with him.	Nitondra izany niaraka taminy izy.
But no.	Saingy tsy misy.
We saw rain.	Nahita orana izahay.
He started to get away with it.	Nanomboka niala tamin’izany izy.
He didn't look at her.	Tsy nijery azy izy.
To my surprise he didn’t ask about it.	Gaga aho fa tsy nanontany momba izany izy.
I saw it again.	Hitako indray ilay izy.
I think they saw me.	Heveriko fa nahita ahy izy ireo.
Nothing is going well tonight.	Tsy misy zavatra mandeha tsara anio alina.
He didn't know what to do.	Tsy fantany izay hataony.
And in fact, it’s really fun.	Ary raha ny marina, dia tena mahafinaritra.
And he does see.	Ary mahita tokoa izy.
That’s what he did to her, thinking about her.	Izany no nataony taminy, nieritreritra momba azy.
During the first week.	Nandritra ny herinandro voalohany.
I called him home.	Niantso azy tany an-trano aho.
You can't follow them.	Tsy afaka manaraka azy ireo ianao.
It will still happen at some point.	Mbola hitranga izany amin'ny fotoana iray.
They were just starting to come out.	Vao nanomboka nivoaka izy ireo.
It is always there.	Eo foana izy io.
Just a little fun.	Mahafinaritra kely fotsiny.
The weather today is good.	Tsara ny andro androany.
Others stopped to look at me.	Nijanona nijery ahy koa ny hafa.
It was still difficult for me to meet him.	Mbola sarotra tamiko ny nihaona taminy.
He knew it.	Fantany izany.
Exactly the same.	Mitovy tanteraka.
But so it is at all hours of the day and night.	Fa toy izany koa ny ora rehetra amin'ny andro sy ny alina.
He saw nothing.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona izy.
We are not happy to see them.	Tsy faly izahay mahita azy ireo.
Sleep well.	Tsara ny torimaso.
Don't think so.	Aza mieritreritra an'izany.
Some thought he was going crazy.	Nisy nihevitra fa lasa adala izy.
I want to tell you something.	Te hilaza zavatra aminao aho.
No one asked him anything.	Tsy nisy nanontany azy na inona na inona.
It will be difficult.	Ho sarotra izany.
Thank you so much for that.	Misaotra betsaka amin'izany.
Something else altogether.	Zavatra hafa mihitsy.
I'm scared of this place.	Matahotra an'io toerana io aho.
He asked for it exactly.	Nangataka izany indrindra izy.
It's too early.	Mbola aloha loatra.
I can't seem to swim.	Toa tsy mahay milomano aho.
He is going well.	Mandeha tsara izy.
I never wanted to look like that.	Tsy te hijery toy izany mihitsy aho.
I know it's not.	Fantatro fa tsy izany.
Of course they do.	Mazava ho azy fa manao izany izy ireo.
Are you looking for.	Mitady ve ianao.
But what he knows now is enough.	Fa izay fantany izao dia ampy.
I never understood that.	Tsy azoko mihitsy izany.
I totally understand.	azoko tanteraka.
He may not know it, but he does.	Mety tsy fantany izany, fa azy izy.
Now, things will be different.	Ankehitriny, ho hafa ny zavatra.
It doesn’t seem very good.	Toa tsy dia tsara loatra.
They have to exist.	Tsy maintsy misy izy ireo.
I thought he would come back.	Nihevitra aho fa hiverina izy.
That is far from true.	Lavitra ny marina izany.
I want to know if they are the same.	Tiako ho fantatra raha mitovy izy ireo.
You tell me.	Lazao amiko.
We don't even have to stop.	Tsy mila mijanona akory isika.
But you won't know it.	Nefa tsy ho fantatrao izany.
I looked here one day.	Nijery teto aho indray andro.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Mbola betsaka ny asa tsy maintsy hatao.
They had to do it.	Tsy maintsy nanao izany izy ireo.
Hard times, in fact.	Fotoana sarotra, raha ny marina.
It was full of money.	Feno vola ilay izy.
I have to say no.	Tsy maintsy miteny aho hoe tsia.
I didn’t get a job because of it.	Tsy nahazo asa aho noho izany.
There is a lot to do.	Betsaka ny tokony hatao.
He is in you.	Ao aminao izy.
Maybe you did.	Angamba ianao nanao izany.

We were not there.	Tsy teo izahay.
Today it is raining.	Toy ny orana ny andro ankehitriny.
He doesn’t want to know this.	Tsy tiany ny mahalala izao.
It could be safe money for both of us.	Mety ho vola azo antoka ho antsika roa izany.

People love to look at me.	Tia mijery ahy ny olona.
It's the same as before.	Mitovy amin’ilay teo aloha ihany ilay izy.
I like a lot of things.	Tiako ny zavatra maro.
And it really says something.	Ary tena milaza zavatra izany.
Not too hard but not too easy.	Tsy dia sarotra loatra fa tsy mora loatra.
The only question is when and how.	Ny hany fanontaniana dia hoe rahoviana ary ahoana.
We have to do it.	Tsy maintsy manao izany isika.
We had a great time, and a great day.	Nahafinaritra be izahay, ary andro nahafinaritra.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Toa tsy nisy na inona na inona nitranga.

But it seems difficult.	Saingy toa sarotra izany.
Because he wrote it before.	Satria izy no nanoratra an'io taloha.

Tonight for dinner.	Anio hariva amin'ny sakafo hariva.
I can go.	Afaka mandeha aho.
I do not remember.	tsy tadidiko.
But it may not be for everyone.	Saingy mety tsy ho an'ny rehetra izany.
We don’t have to do that.	Tsy mila manao izany isika.
I was wrong to blame you.	Diso aho nanome tsiny anao.
And he learned to do so when he was young.	Ary nianatra nanao izany izy fony izy mbola kely.
This is not a problem for you.	Tsy olana aminao izany.
He refuses to do anything.	Tsy mety manao na inona na inona izy.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Tsy te hiresaka momba izany izy.
What time is it?	Inona ny fotoana?
So that’s how it goes.	Dia toy izany no mandeha.
I am still the man.	Mbola ilay lehilahy ihany aho.
One at most.	Iray raha be indrindra.
I love seeing them outside.	Tiako ny mahita azy ireo any ivelany.
This is not how it should be.	Tsy izany no tokony ho izy.
Work is work, and money is money.	Ny asa dia asa, ary ny vola dia vola.
They never had a way.	Tsy nanana fomba mihitsy izy ireo.
When did you last see me?	Oviana ianao no nahita ahy farany?

I am not alone.	Tsy izaho irery.
You don't have to do it every day.	Tsy hoe tsy maintsy manao izany isan’andro ianao.
Even if they do.	Na dia hanao izany aza izy ireo.
People lost their jobs.	Very asa ny olona.
There must be something I didn’t understand.	Tsy maintsy nisy zavatra tsy azoko.
We all sat in the same room.	Nipetraka tao anaty efitrano iray izahay rehetra.
Maybe it’s you.	Angamba ianao izany.
We didn’t say anything, because we didn’t need to.	Tsy niteny na inona na inona izahay, satria tsy nila izany.
Because.	Amin'ny satria.
It's not mine.	Tsy ahy io.

Within three years, he was able to return to work.	Tao anatin’ny telo taona, dia afaka niverina niasa izy.
You just have to do it.	Mila manao izany fotsiny ianao.
So, follow the first idea.	Noho izany, manaraka ny hevitra voalohany.

No problem, we were happy to do it.	Tsy misy olana, faly izahay nanao izany.
Someone came.	Nisy olona tonga.
This is the first.	Ity no voalohany.
All honest people do what they have to do.	Ny marina rehetra dia manao izay tokony hataony.
And of course he did, when he met you.	Ary mazava ho azy fa nanao izany izy, rehefa nihaona taminao izy.
There was also a small house.	Nisy trano kely ihany koa.
I really like it.	Tena tiako ilay izy.

The road sees who these women are.	Ny lalana dia mahita hoe iza ireo vehivavy ireo.
It’s not perfect.	Tsy tanteraka izany.
This new track is fun!	Mahafinaritra ity lalana vaovao ity!
This is not a good way right away.	Tsy fomba tsara avy hatrany izany.
They did not give him money.	Tsy nanome azy vola izy ireo.
Yes, that is for sure.	Eny, azo antoka izany.
Far away, but not far away.	Any lavitra, fa tsy lavitra.
It was very late at night.	Tena alina be ny andro.
I want to do mine.	Te hanao ny ahy aho.

I think I still need to work on the spot.	Heveriko fa mbola mila miasa amin'ny toerana aho.
You can see the right, the right.	Azonao atao ny mahita ny mety, ny mety.
But of course, nothing was really new.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy zavatra tena vaovao mihitsy.
A new house was recently completed.	Nisy trano vaovao vita vao haingana.
He didn’t want either.	Tsy naniry ny iray na ny iray izy.
And, of course, enough sleep.	Ary, mazava ho azy, ampy torimaso.

It just didn’t work.	Tsy nety fotsiny izany.
Thank you for coming!	Misaotra anao tonga!
The girl is right.	Mety ilay tovovavy.
I doubt they will ever come back.	Misalasala aho raha mbola hiverina indray izy ireo.
I'm not worried about that.	Tsy manahy momba izany aho.
I've heard about it.	Efa nandre momba izany aho.
Everything seems more than real.	Toa mihoatra noho ny tena izy ny zava-drehetra.
Travel may be necessary.	Mety ilaina ny dia.
Such a good book.	Boky tsara toy izany.
Yes, bigger.	Eny, lehibe kokoa.

He was happy to see it.	Nahafinaritra azy ny nahita izany.
I didn’t have to write good ideas.	Tsy voatery nanoratra hevitra tsara aho.
He looked again.	Nijery indray izy.
He just needs to think carefully.	Mila mieritreritra tsara fotsiny izy.
And there is.	Ary misy.
Very good indeed.	Tena tsara tokoa.
I said that.	Nolazaiko izany.
He loves them both.	Samy tiany izy ireo.
No one loves him.	Tsy misy tia azy.
Sleep here as long as you like.	Matory eto mandritra ny fotoana tianao.
People thought you liked it.	Nihevitra ny olona fa tianao izany.
Just like yesterday.	Toy ny omaly.
I am very happy.	Tena faly aho.
And it could happen now.	Ary mety hitranga izao.
He was not interested in her.	Tsy liana taminy izy.
There will be another.	Mbola hisy iray hafa.
Maybe not us.	Mety tsy isika.
I just went to see what was happening.	Nandeha nijery fotsiny ny zava-nitranga aho.
The policeman seemed angry.	Toa tezitra ilay polisy.
These two issues seem to be very similar.	Ireo olana roa ireo dia toa mitovy be.
No, it didn't.	Tsia, tsy nisy izany.
I have tried everywhere.	Efa nanandrana na aiza na aiza aho.
You did well.	Tsara ny nataonao.
Nothing more can be done now.	Tsy misy azo atao intsony izao.
Many people got sick.	Olona maro no narary.
People are not his.	Tsy azy ny olona.
It is alive.	Velona izany.
They are just like you and me.	Tahaka ahy sy ianao ihany izy ireo.
He drank a lot of water, even though he was sick.	Nisotro rano betsaka izy, na dia narary aza.
Great stuff, though.	Zavatra lehibe, na dia.
I am very angry.	Tezitra be aho.
I will find something else for him.	Hahita zavatra hafa ho azy aho.
Also, play.	Ary koa, milalao.
They went further.	Lasa lavitra kokoa izy ireo.
You are waiting for me too much.	Miandry ahy loatra ianao.
He found it worse.	Nahita ratsy kokoa izy.
But that’s not really much.	Saingy tsy izany no tena betsaka.
You just don’t know, with a little bit.	Tsy fantatrao fotsiny, miaraka amin'ny kely.
Then, finally, it happened.	Avy eo, tamin'ny farany, nitranga izany.
Do it.	Manao izany.
No one is watching.	Tsy misy mijery.
We couldn’t do that.	Tsy afaka nanao izany izahay.
But, in fact, it is not good.	Saingy, raha ny marina, tsy tsara izany.
He is the one.	Izy no iray.
Very easy.	Tena mora.
That is often true.	Izay matetika no marina.
He didn't even have to say that.	Tsy voatery nilaza izany akory izy.
The worst came to me.	Ny ratsy indrindra dia tonga tamiko.
But for some reason, for this man it did.	Saingy noho ny antony iray, ho an'io lehilahy io dia nanao izany.
You should know things like that.	Tokony ho fantatrao ny zavatra toy izany.
He is often ill.	Matetika izy no marary.
He had many friends.	Nanana namana maro izy.
Thank you for telling the truth.	Misaotra anao nilaza ny marina.
They came and watched.	Tonga izy ireo dia nijery.
Although he shouldn’t be surprised.	Na dia tsy tokony ho gaga aza izy.
There is no such problem.	Tsy misy olana toy izany.
I love it for myself.	Tiako ho azy io.
Tonight is night.	Anio alina no alina.
We just have to try.	Mila miezaka fotsiny isika.
You know right and wrong.	Fantatrao ny tsara sy ny ratsy.
I don’t know how they are.	Tsy haiko hoe manao ahoana izy ireo.
I asked him why he was doing that.	Nanontany azy aho hoe nahoana izy no manao izany.
Like so many others in the story.	Toy ny maro hafa ao amin'ny tantara.
He got it.	Azony izany.
And then we may not.	Ary avy eo dia mety tsy isika.
You know he will come back there.	Fantatrao fa hiverina any izy.
That car was safe.	Nahazo antoka io fiara io.
He used to drink heavily.	Nisotro be izy taloha.
He is angry now.	Tezitra izy izao.
It could be a very long night.	Mety ho alina lava be izany.
You will be easy.	Ho mora ianao.
However, future work remains.	Na izany aza, mbola mijanona ny asa ho avy.
It is not too late to believe.	Mbola tsy tara ny mino.
Not when he looked at them in the house.	Tsy rehefa nijery azy ireo tao anaty trano izy.
I don’t like it the most.	Tsy tiako indrindra ilay izy.
He went alone.	Nandeha irery izy.
It doesn’t tell us anything.	Tsy milaza na inona na inona aminay.
Even though he makes breakfast, he doesn’t speak.	Na dia manao sakafo maraina aza izy dia tsy miteny.
I will not do that.	Tsy hanao izany aho.
He needed another.	Nila hafa izy.
It looks like it.	Toa azy io.
Of course, this will not be the end.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy ho farany izany.
Wrote and discussed the letter.	Nanoratra sy niresaka momba ilay taratasy.
So people who read really read.	Ka ny olona mamaky dia tena mamaky tokoa.
And you never know about these things.	Ary tsy fantatrao mihitsy ny momba ireo zavatra ireo.
Either way, we go.	Na izany na tsy izany dia mandeha isika.
But he liked it.	Saingy tiany izany.
These things are not true.	Tsy marina ireo zavatra ireo.
We just got it.	Vao nahazo izany izahay.
Nothing ever happened.	Tsy nisy mihitsy ny zava-nitranga.
He is a very tall man.	Lehilahy lava be izy.
Not great, though good.	Tsy lehibe, na tsara aza.
The worst is yet to come.	Mbola ho avy ny ratsy indrindra.
Even worse, he was there all the time.	Na ny ratsy kokoa aza, dia tao izy nandritra ny fotoana rehetra.
Both died.	Samy maty izy roa.
That goes two ways, of course.	Izany dia mandeha amin'ny lalana roa, mazava ho azy.
He is no longer used to it.	Tsy zatra izany intsony izy.
It was probably nothing.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona angamba izany.
I want us to be there.	Tiako ho any isika.
You both love the outdoors.	Samy tia ny ivelany ianareo.
It did two things.	Nanao zavatra roa izany.
It certainly won’t be long.	Azo antoka fa tsy ho ela izany.
Now you know how to do it.	Fantatrao izao ny fomba hanaovana izany.
He has spoken, and it must have happened.	Efa niteny izy, ary tsy maintsy nisy izany.
No need to be afraid.	Tsy mila matahotra.
No one loves him.	Tsy misy tia azy.
We stopped for a few minutes.	Nijanona minitra vitsivitsy izahay.
He was playing.	Nilalao izy.
Me, yes.	Izaho, eny.
And they can do it over and over again.	Ary afaka manao izany hatrany hatrany izy ireo.
However, they went well.	Na izany aza, dia nandeha tsara izy ireo.
Don't let anyone tell you who you are.	Aza avela hisy hilaza aminao hoe iza ianao.
I needed to get out of the house.	Nila nivoaka ny trano aho.
It was no more now, even to him.	Tsy nisy intsony izany ankehitriny, na dia taminy aza.
I am leaving this house.	Hiala amin’ity trano ity aho.
Small, but unbelievable.	Kely, nefa tsy azo inoana.
Also, you are wrong about one thing.	Ary koa, diso ianao amin'ny zavatra iray.
We are two cars.	Fiara roa izahay.
The time has come.	Tonga ny fotoana.
He bought a used car.	Nividy fiara efa niasa izy.
No one saw anything.	Tsy nisy nahita na inona na inona.
You should watch them.	Tokony hijery azy ireo ianao.
This man is very much like her.	Tena mitovy amin'ny azy io lehilahy io.
I don't want to talk anymore.	Tsy te hiresaka intsony aho.
He thought so.	Nieritreritra izany izy.
One morning, one afternoon.	Iray maraina, iray tolakandro.
Good time there.	Fotoana tsara tany.
He could not say what time it was.	Tsy afaka nilaza izy hoe amin’ny firy izao.
And it’s even worse than that.	Ary mbola ratsy kokoa noho izany aza izany.
Got in the car.	Niditra tao anaty fiara.
I understand your point.	azoko ny hevitrao.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy izany.
It's been two months.	Roa volana izao.
But he hadn't even called her to tell her.	Saingy tsy mbola niantso azy akory izy hilaza aminy.
Within a few months.	Tao anatin'ny volana vitsivitsy.
He hoped to do so.	Nanantena ny hanao izany izy.
A house is a house.	Ny trano dia trano iray.
It is absolutely true that he drew like a child.	Marina tanteraka fa nanao sary toy ny zaza izy.
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.
He did not understand what was happening.	Tsy azony ny zava-nitranga.
They both did well.	Samy nanao tsara izy roa.
These are hard days.	Andro mafy ireo.
Not too bad.	Tsy ratsy loatra.
Could it be the wrong way.	Mety ho diso lalana ve izany.
He was also good at it.	Nahay tsara koa izy.
I became confused.	Lasa very hevitra aho.
Two is better, but one is better.	Ny roa dia tsara kokoa, fa ny iray dia mety.
But the real problem, of course, is that she’s a woman.	Fa ny tena olana, mazava ho azy, dia vehivavy izy.
Everyone should stay if they get the chance.	Tokony hijanona ny rehetra raha mahazo ny fahafahana.
You don’t eat.	Tsy mihinana ianao.
Maybe they still do.	Angamba mbola manao izany izy ireo.
How to get used to it.	Fomba zatra azy.
It made a lot of money.	Nahazo vola be ilay izy.
I was very happy about that.	Tena faly aho tamin'izany.
The same is true of women.	Toy izany koa ny vehivavy.
They don’t like anything else.	Tsy tia zavatra hafa izy ireo.
But you have another man.	Saingy manana lehilahy hafa ianao.
You get the idea.	Azonao ny hevitra.
They had to stay there.	Tsy maintsy nijanona teo izy ireo.
I wanted freedom.	Naniry fahafahana aho.
During that hour, no one entered or left.	Nandritra io ora io dia tsy nisy olona niditra na nivoaka.
Say what you like about it.	Lazao izay tianao momba izany.
We are allowed to do that.	Avela hanao izany isika.
Maybe that works for you too.	Angamba izany koa no mety aminao.
He has no past, he has no future.	Tsy manana lasa izy, tsy manana ho avy.
Then the work is almost impossible.	Dia saika tsy ho vita ny asa.
He loves it here.	Tiany eto.
However, he really loved her.	Na izany aza, tena tia azy tokoa izy.
For a long time, he stayed that way.	Nandritra ny fotoana ela dia nijanona toy izany izy.
Of course he told me about it.	Mazava ho azy fa nilaza tamiko momba izany izy.
They are almost identical.	Saika mitovy tanteraka izy ireo.
We got a few questions.	Nahazo fanontaniana vitsivitsy izahay.
No more hesitation.	Tsy misalasala intsony.
They stay strong.	Mijanona mafy izy ireo.
Our situation today is very different.	Hafa mihitsy ny toerana misy antsika ankehitriny.
We will get to that.	Ho tonga amin’izany isika.
Not right away.	Tsy ho eo no ho eo.
Maybe something really happened here.	Angamba nisy zavatra tena nisy teto.
The real work, whatever.	Ny tena asa, na inona na inona.
We wanted to leave, but no one was interested in us.	Te ho lasa izahay, nefa tsy misy liana aminay.
An idea.	Hevitra iray.
The truth is the images are powerful.	Ny marina dia mahery ny sary.
He is still young.	Mbola kely izy.
I know that such a thing cannot happen.	Fantatro fa tsy mety hitranga ny zavatra toy izany.
It didn't work.	Tsy niasa.
That may happen one day.	Mety hitranga izany indray andro any.
He is gone now.	Lasa izy izao.
I told them everything.	Nolazaiko azy ireo ny zava-drehetra.
Very good indeed.	Tena tsara tokoa.
I don't need it anymore.	Tsy mila izany intsony aho.
There is no question about that.	Tsy misy fanontaniana momba izany.
It never happened in the end.	Tsy nisy mihitsy izany tamin'ny farany.
I didn’t intend to do that.	Tsy nikasa hanao izany aho.
I don’t remember what it was, but it didn’t really help.	Tsy tadidiko hoe inona ilay izy, fa tsy tena nanampy.
You can talk about it if you like.	Afaka miresaka momba izany ianao raha tianao.
The place is great.	Mahafinaritra ny toerana.
I can't do that.	Tsy vitako izany.
I hope you will join me in this crazy car !.	Manantena aho fa hiaraka amiko amin'ity fiara adala ity ianao!.
Of course, he saw no one.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy nahita olona izy.
We don’t have that here.	Tsy manana izany isika eto.
He had not read it in a long time.	Efa ela izy no tsy namaky azy io.
The dog never stopped.	Tsy nijanona mihitsy ny alika.
No one will see them coming.	Tsy hisy hahita azy ireo ho avy.
He wouldn't have thought of that.	Tsy ho nieritreritra an’izany izy.
I have two.	Manana roa aho.
But they are outside.	Saingy any ivelany izy ireo.
Then, finally, finally.	Avy eo, amin'ny farany, amin'ny farany.
He found work over the weekend.	Nahita asa izy nandritra ny faran'ny herinandro.
It was a special time.	Fotoana manokana izany.
It seems like a year.	Toa taona iray.
He looks at me.	Mijery ahy izy.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Azo antoka ve ianao fa te hanao izany?
Not much he likes here.	Tsy betsaka izay tiany eto.
Not the same as for men.	Tsy mitovy amin'ny an'ny lehilahy.
You are so wonderful.	Tena mahafinaritra ianao.
And he was surprised to see her there.	Dia gaga izy raha nahita azy teo.
I love this kind of thing.	Tiako ity karazana zavatra ity.
Maybe he's not there.	Angamba tsy eo izy.
Here again.	Eto indray.
But now they can no longer talk about it.	Saingy izao dia tsy afaka miresaka momba izany intsony izy ireo.
I'm glad he'll be with me there.	Faly aho fa hiaraka amiko any izy.
I know it’s not easy to know.	Fantatro fa tsy mora ny mahafantatra.
It was so much fun.	Nahafinaritra loatra izany.
We bring bad news again.	Mitondra vaovao ratsy indray isika.
He hasn't looked at me yet.	Mbola tsy nijery ahy izy.
But not like you.	Fa tsy tahaka anao.
He wanted to do something.	Naniry hanao zavatra izy.
But it’s a bit difficult.	Saingy somary sarotra.
This is very bad.	Tena ratsy izany.
I think that would be a really good thing.	Heveriko fa ho zavatra tena tsara izany.
But you first.	Fa ianao aloha.
He looked away again.	Nijery lavitra indray izy.
The two of us will always be there.	Mbola ho eo foana isika roa.
Time seems to pass.	Toa mandeha ny fotoana.
I have seen it in me.	Efa hitako tao amiko izany.
I want to do the same.	Te hanao izany koa aho.
In his car.	Amin'ny fiarany.
Good job.	Asa tsara.
I need to know everything.	Mila mahafantatra ny zava-drehetra aho.
But for now, it’s for you.	Fa amin'izao fotoana izao dia ho anao izany.
We should be angry.	Tokony ho tezitra isika.
It doesn't look good.	Toa tsy tsara ilay izy.
They are both great players.	Samy mpilalao mahay izy ireo.
Maybe they were with him.	Angamba niaraka taminy izy ireo.
I look at them.	Mijery azy ireo aho.
Of course they are.	Mazava ho azy ireo izany.
So, you come.	Noho izany, tonga ianao.

People want to help you.	Te hanampy anao ny olona.
For a week, though.	Nandritra ny herinandro, na dia.
I thought you wanted to be with me.	Nieritreritra aho fa te hiaraka amiko ianao.
I will lose my job.	Ho very asa aho.
A few moments.	Fotoana vitsivitsy.
But it certainly isn’t anymore.	Saingy azo antoka fa tsy misy intsony.
I still have a lot of questions.	Mbola manana fanontaniana be dia be aho.
That may be true.	Mety ho marina izany.
You are not the danger.	Tsy ianao no loza.
Are you with us ?.	Miaraka aminay ve ianao?.
I went out to feed him.	Nivoaka hanome sakafo azy aho.
Very happy thank you.	Tena faly misaotra.

They really don’t know anything.	Tena tsy mahalala na inona na inona izy ireo.
She is very happy.	Faly be izy.

He refused to admit that he had a problem.	Tsy nety niaiky izy fa nanana olana.
Somewhat surprised, too.	Somary gaga ihany koa.
It was hard to walk.	Sarotra ny nandeha.
I have no reason for that to happen.	Tsy manana antony aho fa nitranga izany.

I don’t know about them.	Tsy fantatro ny momba azy ireo.
We were only together one afternoon.	Indray tolakandro ihany izahay no niaraka.
I asked him what the problem was.	Nanontany azy aho hoe inona no olana.
You are not alone.	Tsy ianao ihany.
I play too.	Milalao koa aho.
Will you take a good look at the car?	Hijery tsara ny fiara ve ianao?
We also watch and wait.	Mijery sy miandry koa izahay.
No need to ask what if.	Tsy mila manontany hoe ahoana raha.
I might do that.	Mety hanao izany aho.
This is the farthest place to travel.	Ity no toerana lavitra indrindra amin'ny dia.
Of course he was right.	Mazava ho azy fa marina izy.
You’re still thinking about him, aren’t you?	Mbola mieritreritra ny momba azy ianao, sa tsy izany?
This is not a bad thing at all.	Tsy ratsy daholo koa izany.
It’s completely doable.	Azo atao tanteraka izany.
Kids love it.	Ankizy tia azy.
And something else.	Ary zavatra hafa.
You will never do that.	Tsy hanao izany mihitsy ianao.
They may be right, but we have to wait.	Mety ho marina izy ireo, saingy tsy maintsy miandry.

He said he would see it.	Nilaza izy fa hahita izany.
He was there.	Teo izy.

This is very true.	Tena marina izany.

He could always find a story.	Afaka nahita tantara foana izy.

I can't help it.	Tsy afaka tsy aho.
We are all free.	Afaka isika rehetra.

For better, for worse, we are here.	Ho tsara kokoa, ho ratsy kokoa, eto isika.
We were angry and scared.	Tezitra sy natahotra izahay.

I am not wrong to help people in need.	Tsy diso aho manampy ny olona sahirana.
I went back to work alone.	Niverina niasa irery aho.
There were about thirty cars.	Nisy fiara telopolo teo ho eo.
This is the only way.	Io no hany lalana.
And he couldn't blame her.	Ary tsy afaka nanome tsiny azy izy.
Should be good or not ?.	Tokony ho tsara sa tsy izany?.

I was afraid it was going to happen.	Natahotra aho fa hitranga izany.

He will be there.	Ho any izy.
But do nothing.	Fa aza manao na inona na inona.
A minute ago.	Iray minitra lasa izay.
It’s hard to believe that so many people can believe that!	Sarotra inoana fa maro ny olona afaka mino izany!
Others are less fortunate.	Ny hafa kosa tsy dia tsara vintana.
Even if you’re not.	Na dia tsy ianao aza.
I never thought that day would come.	Tsy nieritreritra mihitsy hoe ho avy io andro io.

He was very scared.	Natahotra be izy.
I saw him once.	Indray mandeha aho no nahita azy.
He won't look at me.	Tsy hijery ahy izy.
I never wanted to see them.	Tsy te hahita azy ireo mihitsy.
It didn't work for him.	Tsy nety taminy izany.
There is a new movie.	Misy sarimihetsika vaovao.
In fact, they should do less.	Raha ny marina dia tokony hanao kely kokoa izy ireo.
But they have to look further into history.	Saingy tokony hijery lavitra kokoa amin'ny tantara izy ireo.
Some might say it differently.	Mety hisy hilaza izany amin'ny fomba hafa.
Good deeds are the same as true words.	Ny asa tsara dia mitovy amin'ny teny marina.
It doesn’t help anyone in the end.	Tsy manampy na iza na iza izany amin'ny farany.
It had nothing to do with it.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona taminy izany.

He alone loves me.	Izy irery no tia ahy.
I’m glad no one saw it.	Faly aho fa tsy nisy nahita izany.
That's what happened.	Izany no nitranga.
It's too easy.	Mora loatra izany.

You will learn to love him.	Hianatra ho tia azy ianao.
Tonight, if possible.	Anio alina, raha azo atao.

Come on a day like this.	Tonga amin'ny andro tahaka izao.
But I’m always surprised in the end.	Fa gaga foana aho amin'ny farany.
You had to act like everything was fun.	Tsy maintsy nanao zavatra toy ny hoe mahafinaritra ny zava-drehetra ianao.
I was scared.	Natahotra aho.
This has not yet happened either.	Mbola tsy nitranga koa izany.
But others work as well.	Fa miasa koa ny hafa.
One a day.	Iray isan'andro.
He slept and watched a movie.	Natory izy ary nijery sarimihetsika.
We really did exist! 	Tena nisy tokoa izahay!
He could not write.	Tsy nahay nanoratra izy.
It didn’t seem to be there very long.	Toa tsy teo ela be.
We are different.	Samy hafa izahay.
She is beautiful.	Tsara tarehy izy.
To me, the truth is enough.	Amiko dia ampy ny marina.
But that is not true.	Saingy tsy marina izany.
Don’t just sit and wait for what will happen to him.	Aza mipetraka fotsiny miandry izay hitranga ho azy.
If you also enjoy reading stories or books.	Raha tia mamaky tantara na boky koa ianao.

You hope so.	Manantena ianao fa izany.

I'm trying.	Miezaka aho.

That's all.	Izany rehetra izany.
I have to see him.	Tsy maintsy mahita azy aho.
I can help you with this friend.	Afaka manampy anao amin'ity namana ity aho.
That was the last thing he wanted.	Izany no zavatra farany tiany.
And we need another one.	Ary mila iray hafa isika.
I don't need anything else.	Tsy mila zavatra hafa aho.
It can even be dangerous.	Mety ho loza mihitsy aza.

They are here.	Eny eto izy ireo.
You are beautiful, like you slept once.	Tsara tarehy ianao, toy ny natory indray mandeha.

So did the man.	Toy izany koa ilay lehilahy.
Then you try to get there but it’s really hard.	Dia miezaka ny ho tonga any ianao fa tena sarotra.
And that’s all, you know.	Ary izany no zava-drehetra, fantatrao.
Maybe that's what it should be.	Izany angamba no tokony ho izy.
However, for sure.	Na izany aza, azo antoka.
We think of you every day.	Mieritreritra anao isan'andro izahay.
I know how.	fantatro ny fomba.
I don’t know why he came to that.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana izy no tonga amin'izany.
It just happened.	Nitranga ihany izany.
We are very happy.	Faly be izahay.
I asked who it was.	Nanontany aho hoe iza io.
Then that question finally came up.	Dia tonga ihany io fanontaniana io tamin'ny farany.
Where? ' 	Aiza?'
Here is a better one.	Ity misy iray tsara kokoa.
This man was lucky not to see her.	Tsara vintana io lehilahy io fa tsy nahita azy.
We are not talking.	Tsy miresaka izahay.
Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised.	Angamba tsy tokony ho gaga isika.
When or why is unknown.	Rahoviana na nahoana no tsy fantatra.
I don’t have to read a lot of books.	Tsy mila mamaky boky maro aho.
We started writing songs right away.	Nanomboka nanoratra hira avy hatrany izahay.

It could be better.	Mety ho tsara kokoa.
You can get it after reading.	Afaka mahazo ianao rehefa avy mamaky.
And his heart.	Ary ny fony.
Finally he talked to me.	Farany dia niresaka tamiko izy.
And it just came out a few months ago.	Ary vao nivoaka volana vitsivitsy lasa izay.
There were many.	Nisy maro.
Then they decided that.	Avy eo dia nanapa-kevitra izy ireo izany.
I know very well.	fantatro tsara.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Tsy te hiresaka momba azy aho.
They say it is about to rain.	Milaza izy ireo fa efa akaiky ny orana.

And here.	Ary eto.
I've tried.	Efa nanandrana aho.
When he entered the room, he knew something was wrong.	Rehefa niditra ny efitrano izy dia fantany fa misy zavatra tsy mety.
It's never too late.	Tsy tara mihitsy.
He loves music, of course.	Tiany ny mozika, mazava ho azy.

Especially if they’re older than you, it’s not going to happen.	Indrindra fa raha be taona kokoa noho ianao izy ireo, dia tsy hitranga izany.

He is still young.	Mbola kely izy.
Recently, people have started driving more and more.	Vao haingana, nanomboka nitondra fiara bebe kokoa ny olona.

I tell him to stay.	Miteny aminy aho mba hijanona.
He said he did not know why.	Nilaza izy fa tsy fantany ny antony.
How many more are there ?.	Firy indray no misy?.
I can’t say I have it.	Tsy afaka milaza aho fa manana izany.
He wanted it.	Naniry izany izy.
He enjoyed doing it.	Nahafinaritra azy ny nanao izany.
This is the bad news.	Ity no vaovao ratsy.
I knew that when he started.	Fantatro izany rehefa nanomboka izy.
Don’t learn anything.	Aza mianatra na inona na inona.
Looking for a small space.	Mitady toerana kely.
It's better he doesn't have it.	Aleo izy tsy manana.
I said I didn’t do it because I couldn’t.	Nilaza aho fa tsy nanao izany satria tsy afaka.
Only two men called me beautiful.	Lehilahy roa ihany no niantso ahy hoe tsara tarehy.
He was scared now.	Natahotra izy izao.
Surely that is what happened.	Azo antoka fa izany no nitranga.
It used to be.	Teo aloha izany.
Now she has come to love him.	Ankehitriny dia lasa tia azy izy.
But he was always lucky.	Saingy tsara vintana foana izy.
It doesn't work.	Tsy mandeha izany.
He didn't say a word.	Tsy niteny na dia kely akory aza izy.
That is not the problem.	Tsy izany no olana.
It made him go faster.	Nahatonga azy handeha haingana kokoa izany.
I was really helpful with the kids.	Tena nanana fanampiana tamin'ny ankizy aho.
You're coming, aren't you?	Ho avy ianao, sa tsy izany?
People said that then.	Niteny izany ny olona tamin’izany.
This is not a new idea.	Tsy hevitra vaovao izany.
Maybe he doesn’t understand these either.	Angamba tsy azony koa ireo.
We’re not talking about music at all, it’s about making movies.	Tsy miresaka mozika mihitsy izahay, fa ny fanaovana sarimihetsika.
A lot has happened since then.	Betsaka ny zavatra nitranga nanomboka teo.
I'm sorry you have to.	Miala tsiny aho fa tsy maintsy ianao.
I have gone too far and it is difficult to bring the news.	Lasa lavitra sy sarotra aho hitondra ny vaovao.
It didn't hurt much.	Tsy dia narary izany.
Money, money, money!	Vola, vola, vola!
Good job with this.	Asa tsara miaraka amin'ity.
No one will tell me anything.	Tsy hisy hilaza na inona na inona amiko.
I wonder who owns the land now.	Manontany tena aho hoe iza no manana ny tany ankehitriny.
I know exactly what this little thing is.	Fantatro tsara hoe inona io zavatra kely io.
He went without saying a word.	Nandeha tsy niteny izy.
If you can do the following, well and good.	Raha azonao atao ny manaraka dia tsara ary tsara.
Well.	Eny ary.
He loves the outdoors.	Tiany ny any ivelany.
He is still young.	Mbola kely izy.
He doesn't understand me.	Tsy azony aho.
We really needed the money.	Tena nila ny vola izahay.
Especially water.	Indrindra fa ny rano.
It's not too busy.	Tsy dia be atao loatra ilay izy.
She had seen the man too.	Efa nahita an'io lehilahy io koa izy.
And not just me.	Ary tsy izaho ihany.
Or maybe he just liked her first.	Na angamba izy ihany no tiany voalohany.
He told me he was in his room.	Nilaza tamiko izy fa tao amin'ny efitranony.
I don’t want him to be angry.	Tsy tiako ho tezitra izy.
We have to ask him.	Tsy maintsy manontany azy isika.
For an hour nothing seemed to happen.	Nandritra ny adiny iray dia toa tsy nisy zavatra nitranga.
It knows nothing wrong.	Tsy mahalala diso izany.
That is a question.	Fanontaniana io.
That should be far away.	Tokony ho lavitra izany.
Otherwise, one will get a more difficult job.	Raha tsy izany dia hahazo asa sarotra kokoa ny olona iray.
I think something is wrong.	Heveriko fa misy zavatra tsy mety.
It could be me.	Mety ho izaho.
They were busy walking.	Sahirana izy ireo nandeha.
It looks like a dead thing.	Toa zavatra maty izany.
They asked me about it.	Nanontany ahy momba azy izy ireo.
It never goes away.	Tsy miala mihitsy izany.
Always a little.	Kely foana.
At first, he didn't seem to hear.	Toa tsy nandre izy tamin’ny voalohany.
They are confused.	Very hevitra izy ireo.
He is not like that.	Tsy toy izany izy.
He seems to be asleep, happy.	Toa matory izy, faly.
It hasn’t gone too far yet.	Tsy mbola lasa lavitra loatra izany.
Yes and not yet.	Eny ary tsy mbola.
They really want to help you.	Tena te hanampy anao izy ireo.
That will never happen, of course.	Tsy hitranga mihitsy izany, mazava ho azy.
He never said anything about the letter.	Tsy nilaza na inona na inona momba ilay taratasy mihitsy izy.
He may not like it.	Mety tsy tiany izany.
But in fact.	Saingy raha ny marina.
I had to build a house for myself.	Tsy maintsy nanao trano ho ahy aho.
Nice place, and nice people.	Toerana mahafinaritra, ary olona mahafinaritra.
I didn’t and stopped.	Tsy nanao izany aho ary nijanona.
These are the things he did.	Ireo no zavatra nataony.
I learned to drink.	Nianatra nisotro aho.
Otherwise, you have never had such a chance.	Raha tsy izany dia mbola tsy nanana vintana toy izany ianao.
He can't help himself.	Tsy afaka manampy ny tenany.
Went a few minutes.	Nandeha minitra vitsivitsy.
Today is not clear.	Tsy mazava izao andro izao.
I wanted to be that man.	Naniry ny ho io lehilahy io aho.
Or maybe not.	Na mety tsy.
Lovely woman.	Vehivavy mahafinaritra.
It helps with everything.	Manampy amin'ny zavatra rehetra izany.
I worked hard all day.	Niasa mafy nandritra ny andro aho.
It is very easy for them.	Tena mora ho azy ireo izany.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
You did it.	Ianao no nanao azy.
It all seems to be fully prepared, as it were.	Toa efa vonona tanteraka daholo izany rehetra izany, toy izany.
Of course you know.	Mazava ho azy fa fantatrao.
It is not necessary.	Tsy ilaina izany.
We have to disagree again.	Tsy maintsy tsy mitovy hevitra indray isika.
I've tried it.	Efa nanandrana izany aho.
It’s really hard.	Tena sarotra izany.
The truth is, they never do.	Ny marina dia tsy manao izany mihitsy izy ireo.
Tell me more about this book.	Lazao ahy bebe kokoa momba io boky io.
Me too at first.	Izaho koa tamin'ny voalohany.
He will win.	Handresy izy.
I'm not going anywhere.	Tsy handeha ho aiza aho.
The old things are bad.	Ratsy ny zavatra taloha.
Many have.	Maro no efa.
I don't need anything else from you.	Tsy mila zavatra hafa avy aminao aho.
It was wrong.	Tsy nety izany.
He really likes it.	Tena tiany izany.
I need both.	Mila azy roa aho.
And they will know where.	Ary ho fantany hoe aiza.
Thanks for everything.	Misaotra amin'ny zavatra rehetra.
I just don’t understand.	Tsy azoko fotsiny.
This is more than wrong.	Izany dia mihoatra noho ny tsy mety.
And that is the story.	Ary izay no tantara.
I will see something else.	Hahita zavatra hafa aho.
The reason is well known.	Fantatra tsara ny antony.
I'm not ready.	tsy vonona aho.
You are absolutely right.	Tena marina ianao.
He still is.	Mbola izy.
He didn't want to talk to her right away.	Tsy te hiresaka taminy avy hatrany izy.
We thank you for this meal.	Misaotra anao izahay noho ity sakafo ity.
These are the only ones that can be done.	Ireo ihany no azo atao.
I don’t get them.	Tsy mahazo azy ireo.
He just seemed interested in talking to me.	Toa liana hiresaka tamiko fotsiny izy.
Everyone thought it was great.	Nihevitra ny rehetra fa tena tsara izany.
That's all.	Izany rehetra izany.
One, of course, is timing.	Ny iray, mazava ho azy, dia ny fotoana.
There was no room for error.	Tsy nisy toerana ho an'ny fahadisoana.
And you.	Ary ianao.
Too much time has passed.	Be loatra ny fotoana lasa.
And not now.	Ary tsy izao.
I walk.	Mandeha aho.
Stupid thing to do.	Zavatra adala atao.
I'm sure you can't help it.	Azoko antoka fa tsy afaka manampy anao ianao.
But he still goes.	Saingy mbola mandeha izy.
They don’t need a lot of water.	Tsy mila rano betsaka izy ireo.
He knows it now.	Fantany izany izao.
We still have to do it.	Mbola tsy maintsy manao izany isika.
It's not that bad.	Tsy dia ratsy izany.
I already ate breakfast.	Efa nihinana ny sakafo maraina aho.
I find that to be very true.	Hitako fa tena marina izany.
You don’t have to do anything anymore.	Tsy mila manao na inona na inona intsony ianao.
I am angry.	Tezitra aho.
Nothing is stronger than that.	Tsy misy mahery noho izany.
In fact, we don’t talk about too much.	Raha ny marina dia tsy miresaka zavatra be loatra izahay.
The place was great.	Nahafinaritra ny toerana.
It’s great to carry you.	Tena tsara ny mitondra anao.
It's nothing.	Tsy inona izany.
But I, and everyone like me, wanted to get it.	Fa izaho, ary ny olona rehetra toa ahy, tiany ho azo.
And he wanted me to be with him.	Ary tiany hiaraka aminy aho.
He is too good.	Tsara loatra izy.
When will they arrive?	Rahoviana izy ireo no ho tonga?
It seemed to help.	Toa nanampy izany.
He looked away.	Nijery lavitra izy.
And that may be true.	Ary mety ho marina izany.
And then sleep.	Ary avy eo matory.
Something went wrong.	Nisy zavatra tsy nety.
So he didn't like it.	Ka tsy tiany ilay izy.
But if you don’t, it doesn’t matter.	Fa raha tsy manao izany ianao dia tsy maninona.
He is full and true.	Feno sy marina Izy.
For me especially.	Ho ahy indrindra.
I'm not very sick.	Tsy marary tsara aho.
It’s hard.	Sarotra izany.
It follows.	Manaraka izany .
I have no doubt.	Tsy misalasala mihitsy aho.
He could not be alone.	Tsy nahay irery izy.
There was a very compelling reason to do so.	Nisy antony tena mafy nanao izany.
I thought it was great.	Noheveriko fa tsara be ilay izy.
I hope this helps !.	Manantena aho fa hanampy izany!.
We stay there and wait for the night.	Mijanona ao izahay ary miandry ny alina.
There used to be cars that looked like cars.	Nisy fiara toa fiara koa taloha.
Died that morning.	Maty io maraina io.
No, that's not a good idea.	Tsia, tsy hevitra tsara izany.
I didn't say much.	Tsy niteny betsaka aho.
It’s hard.	Sarotra izany.
When he arrives.	Rehefa tonga izy.
All before.	Izay rehetra teo aloha.
You are not ready for that.	Tsy vonona tamin'izany ianao.
You just need something else.	Mila zavatra hafa fotsiny ianao.
I really don’t like doing that.	Tena tsy tiako ny manao izany.
That sounds like a good idea to me.	Toa hevitra tsara amiko izany.
Nothing is clearly known.	Tsy misy fantatra mazava.
But here it goes.	Fa izao no mandeha.
That brings us to the present.	Izany dia mitondra antsika amin'izao fotoana izao.
You are very close to him.	Tena akaiky azy ianao.
He studied hard, then spoke.	Nianatra tsara izy, avy eo niteny.
It will come out.	Hivoaka io.
Which house will be ours this afternoon?	Trano iza no ho antsika anio tolakandro?
I need money.	Mila vola aho.
You will make friends.	Hahazo namana ianao.
Yes, it can be.	Eny, mety ho izany tokoa.
I never thought hard about it.	Tsy nieritreritra mafy momba izany mihitsy aho.
I don’t think it will be difficult.	Heveriko fa tsy ho sarotra izany.
I like it but it’s a bit out of the way.	Tiako ilay izy fa somary miala amin'ny lalana.
He really likes this job.	Tena tiany io asa io.
I can say that because it is true.	Afaka milaza izany aho satria marina izany.
Everything went well.	Nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
So why keep asking.	Koa maninona no manontany foana.
It's ours.	Ny anay izany.
This is all true.	Marina daholo izany.
Everything went well.	Nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
Not on the ground.	Tsy amin'ny tany.
He had heard the bad news.	Efa nandre ny vaovao ratsy izy.

He was not wrong.	Tsy diso izy.
That was my problem.	Izay no olana tamiko.
We are ready when you are ready.	Vonona izahay rehefa vonona ianao.
You need to wait a few minutes.	Mila miandry minitra vitsivitsy ianao.
He worked hard.	Niasa mafy izy.
I don't look like this picture anymore.	Tsy mitovy amin'ity sary ity intsony ny ahy.
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.
You can find others.	Afaka mahita hafa ianao.
I think he must have been sick a long time ago.	Heveriko fa tsy maintsy narary efa ela izy.
The same is true of people.	Toy izany koa ny olona.
I don't even remember about it.	Tsy tadidiko akory ny momba ilay izy.
There are many ways to do this.	Misy fomba maro hanaovana izany.
Apparently not.	Toa tsy izany.
We have to do it now.	Tsy maintsy manao izany isika izao.
But we did.	Saingy nanao izany izahay.
They are not alive.	Tsy velona izy ireo.
I know it’s bad for me.	Fantatro fa ratsy amiko izany.
Then they started writing great things for me.	Avy eo dia nanomboka nanoratra zavatra lehibe ho ahy izy ireo.
The reason is still unknown.	Mbola tsy fantatra ny antony.
They are all full.	Feno izy rehetra.
She is a hard working woman.	Vehivavy miasa mafy io.
You have talked to him before.	Efa niresaka taminy ianao taloha.
We both have.	Samy manana isika.
Clearer at the right time.	Mazava kokoa amin'ny fotoana mety.
People are already going there.	Efa mandeha any ny olona.
No, not the earth.	Tsia, tsy ny tany.
I want to go out.	Te hivoaka aho.
I'm really sorry.	Tena miala tsiny aho.
And it was a complete surprise to come here.	Ary gaga tanteraka ny tonga eto.
There must have been more to the story.	Tsy maintsy nisy bebe kokoa ny tantara.

Now they are here.	Ankehitriny dia teto izy ireo.
This one thing.	Izao zavatra iray izao.
With food.	Miaraka amin'ny sakafo.
We have greater opportunities now.	Manana fahafahana lehibe kokoa isika ankehitriny.
And not everything should be about money.	Ary tsy ny zava-drehetra tokony ho momba ny vola.
And it may still be the same.	Ary mety mbola ho toy izany ihany.
These issues are often complex issues with a long history.	Ireo olana ireo dia matetika olana sarotra amin'ny tantara lava.
And that’s a lot of words.	Ary izany dia teny maro.
If only that were true.	Raha mba marina izany.
It takes time like that.	Mila fotoana toy izany.
I’m not really sure how to do that.	Tsy tena azoko antoka ny fomba hanaovana izany.
But it really comes out.	Fa tena avy.
Tell him to leave.	Lazao azy mba hiala.
Real work.	Asa tena izy.
Then we learned that it wasn’t real.	Avy eo dia nianatra izahay fa tsy tena izy io.
It’s easier and more fun.	Mora kokoa sy mahafinaritra kokoa izany.
He didn't get dinner.	Tsy nahazo sakafo hariva izy.
Don't even ask.	Aza manontany akory.
No major issues.	Tsy misy olana lehibe.
I see more of it than you do.	Hitako bebe kokoa amin'izany noho ianao.

Or go somewhere else.	Na ho any amin'ny toerana hafa.

Which he could have done.	Izay mety ho nataony.
Playing for real money.	Milalao vola tena izy.
He is a bit far from me.	Somary lavitra ahy izy.

Very good.	Tena tsara.
There is something for everyone here.	Misy zavatra ho an'ny rehetra eto.
Of course I can't.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka aho.

If we leave, fine.	Raha miala isika dia tsara.
Too often it won’t be true.	Matetika loatra ka tsy ho marina.
We learned that it was very hard.	Nianatra izahay fa mafy be ilay izy.
He was ready, he knew.	Efa vonona izy, fantany.
But then something else.	Fa ny zavatra hafa avy eo.
They have opportunities now, in the future.	Manana fahafahana izy ireo ankehitriny, ho avy.

We can help people in need.	Afaka manampy olona mila fanampiana isika.
I stay in front.	Mijanona eo aloha aho.

However, we did nothing wrong.	Na izany aza, tsy nanao ratsy izahay.
I love doing things.	Tiako ny manao zavatra.
They may also know that.	Mety ho fantany koa izany.
He is interested.	Liana izy.
They should be the same.	Tokony ho iray ihany izy ireo.
Not today.	Tsy amin'izao andro izao.
The music is a bit offensive now.	Somary tezitra ny mozika ankehitriny.
Whatever he used to be.	Na inona na inona izy taloha.
This is likely for two reasons.	Azo inoana fa noho ny antony roa izany.
It does a good job.	Manao ny asa tsara izany.
I was so scared.	Natahotra be aho.
The book is very good.	Tena tsara ilay boky.
I think it’s a little too fast.	Heveriko fa somary haingana loatra izany.
Tell him you can't read.	Lazao azy fa tsy mahay mamaky teny ianao.
A man walked away when police questioned.	Nisy lehilahy iray nandeha rehefa nanontany ny polisy.
I really don’t remember.	Tena tsy tadidiko.

Once he gets to that, that’s it.	Raha vao tonga amin'izany izy dia izay.

He said he would.	Nilaza izy fa hanao izany.
People are just angry.	Tezitra fotsiny ny olona.
Many players can meet and be friends.	Maro ny mpilalao afaka hihaona sy ho namana.
You are one of the last.	Iray amin'ireo farany ianao.
It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona izany.

I have an idea.	Manana hevitra aho.
The same is true here.	Toy izany koa ny eto.
They will never do that.	Tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy ireo.
The story goes one way and then the other.	Ny tantara dia mandeha amin'ny lalana iray ary avy eo amin'ny lalana hafa.
Worried about you.	Manahy anao.
These two things are as different as night and day.	Samy hafa toy ny alina sy ny andro ireo zavatra roa ireo.
We tried, far, far more than anyone.	Nanandrana, lavitra, mihoatra noho ny olona rehetra izahay.
They thought it would be higher.	Nihevitra izy ireo fa ho ambony kokoa.
He is not like that.	Tsy mba toy izany izy.
And you think.	Ary mieritreritra ianao.
How many women ?.	Firy ny vehivavy?.

That’s what it’s about.	Izany no momba izany.
It’s a small place.	Toerana kely izy io.
Yes more.	Eny bebe kokoa.
I never read it.	Tsy namaky azy mihitsy aho.

The girl asked him why he was there.	Nanontany azy ilay tovovavy hoe nahoana izy no tao.
I'm ready to party.	Vonona ny hanao fety aho.
It happened because this movie had a big problem.	Nitranga izany satria nanana olana lehibe ity sarimihetsika ity.
Now there was something else.	Ankehitriny dia nisy zavatra hafa.

This is very clear.	Mazava be izany.
Two people died here.	Olona roa no maty teto.
They felt free.	Nahatsiaro ho afaka izy ireo.
So is everyone else.	Toy izany koa ny rehetra.
It started well.	Nanomboka tsara izany.

He went to work, but hoped to return soon.	Nandeha niasa izy, saingy nanantena ny hiverina tsy ho ela.

As for him.	Raha ny aminy.
Walk around the room.	Mandeha eny amin'ny efitrano.
He stopped.	Nijanona izy.
Either way, it’s not going to happen.	Na izany na tsy izany dia tsy hitranga izany.
He, too, of course.	Izy koa, mazava ho azy.
It had just happened to him.	Vao avy nitranga taminy izany.
It seemed to be waiting for something.	Toa niandry zavatra ilay izy.
He had been there before.	Efa tany izy taloha.
We need to talk.	Mila miresaka isika.
We enjoyed the evening.	Nahafinaritra anay ny hariva.
It's not mine.	Tsy ahy izany.

But there was nothing.	Saingy tsy nisy na inona na inona.
It will never happen.	Tsy hitranga mihitsy izany.
Now that’s really not true.	Izao dia tena tsy marina izany.

You may not be able to speak very fast more than once.	Mety tsy afaka miteny haingana be mihoatra ny indray mandeha ianao.

The child learned quickly.	Nianatra haingana ilay zaza.

That is exactly what happened.	Izany tokoa no nitranga.
I thought it would go in the morning, but it still wasn’t there.	Nihevitra aho fa handeha ny maraina, nefa mbola tsy nisy izany.

And looking for a lot of people like you.	Ary mitady olona maro toa anao.
But the night is fast approaching.	Fa avy haingana ny alina.

No one told you at the time.	Tsy nisy na iza na iza nilaza taminao tamin'izany fotoana izany.
He doesn't seem interested.	Toa tsy liana izy.
Whatever.	Na inona na inona.
That’s not the kind of thing he understands well.	Tsy izany no karazana zavatra azony tsara.
It is not.	Tsy izany.
I think there could be something more than that.	Heveriko fa mety hisy zavatra bebe kokoa noho izany.
The room is small.	Kely ny efitrano.
From ???????? 	Avy amin'ny ????????
He was still unconscious and could not speak.	Mbola tsy nahatsiaro tena izy fa tsy afaka niteny.

Where do you think the child might be?	Mety ho aiza ilay zaza araka ny hevitrao?
I don't know what to do.	Tsy hitako izay hatao.
It is not lost.	Tsy very izany.
However, this does not work for the following reasons.	Na izany aza, tsy mandeha izany noho ny antony manaraka.
I think that’s the way it should be done.	Heveriko fa izany no fomba tokony hanaovana izany.
It could be a more difficult approach.	Mety ho fomba sarotra kokoa izany.
If you try to search, you will find it.	Raha miezaka mitady ianao dia hahita azy.

They had nothing and needed everything.	Tsy nanana na inona na inona izy ireo ary nila ny zava-drehetra.
You need to leave this place now.	Mila miala amin'ity toerana ity ianao izao.
Then we watched.	Dia nijery izahay.

Especially someone like you.	Indrindra fa olona toa anao.
It’s a surefire time.	Fotoana azo antoka izany.
Who knows where it will be next week.	Iza no mahalala hoe aiza no hisy azy amin’ny herinandro ambony.
There was nothing.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona.
I went alone.	Nandeha irery aho.
That's the idea.	Izany no hevitra.
But maybe there is another way to come.	Fa angamba misy lalana hafa ho avy.
I sat there trying to think.	Nipetraka teo aho niezaka nieritreritra.
The police have no chance between you and me.	Tsy manana fahafahana ny polisy eo amiko sy ianao.

I was hoping	Nanantena aho
These are the people who hurt us.	Ireo no olona manao ratsy antsika.
I had no idea anyone had done that until recently.	Tsy fantatro mihitsy hoe nisy nanao an'izany hatramin'ny vao haingana.

For.	Ho an'ny.
They decided to go see him.	Nanapa-kevitra ny handeha hijery azy izy ireo.

This is true, at the very least.	Marina izany raha kely indrindra, raha kely indrindra.
They don't even talk about it.	Tsy miresaka an’izany akory izy ireo.

Those days are over.	Vita ireo andro ireo.
The man seemed to be thinking.	Toa nieritreritra ilay lehilahy.
No one is there.	Tsy misy olona ao.

There may be.	Mety misy.

He is very busy.	Be atao be izy.
Tell me what you think of the room !.	Lazao ahy ny hevitrao momba ny efitrano!.

That will not be done.	Izay tsy ho vita.

And in fact, so is he.	Ary raha ny marina, dia toy izany koa izy.

That’s what the hour is all about.	Izany no tena ilaina amin'ny ora.
In a bad way.	Amin'ny fomba ratsy.

If he was in his room.	Raha tao amin'ny efitranony izy.
If anything can be ours, fine.	Raha misy mety ho antsika dia tsara.
This is it.	Izao no izy.

No, thanks!	Tsia, misaotra!
They might go.	Mety handeha izy ireo.
Now there is a question about that.	Izao vao misy fanontaniana momba izany.
Not so.	Tsy toy izany.
We were able to talk at length about this issue.	Afaka niresaka lava be momba ity olana ity isika.
This is how it is.	Toy izao ihany no misy azy.
It's new to me that he's not.	Vaovao amiko ny hoe tsy izy.
As long as people don’t work on it.	Raha mbola tsy miasa amin'izany ny olona.
We are ready for that.	Efa vonona amin’izany izahay.
We have never been here.	Mbola tsy teto mihitsy izahay.
You are wrong.	Diso ianao.
There are only three of them.	Telo ihany izy ireo.
i get it now.	azoko izany izao.
Very similar.	Mitovy be.
Last month.	Tamin'ny volana lasa izay.
He believes it will happen again.	Mino izy fa mbola hitranga indray izany.
They heard stories.	Nandre tantara izy ireo.
It doesn’t have to be me or you.	Tsy voatery hoe izaho na ianao.
In fact, it may be the same.	Raha ny marina dia mety ho iray ihany izany.
A very long time.	Fotoana lava be.
Here we are.	Eto izahay.
I couldn't drink it.	Tsy afaka nisotro an'io aho.
Even go home.	Mody an-trano aza.
They didn't have to go that fast.	Tsy nila nandeha haingana toy izany izy ireo.
Believe it or not, they are lucky.	Na mino na tsia, tsara vintana izy ireo.
Because it’s a really good movie.	Satria sarimihetsika tena tsara izy io.
Of course he was done.	Mazava ho azy fa vita izy.
The evening came quickly.	Tonga haingana ny hariva.
He himself had other problems.	Izy mihitsy no nanana olana hafa.
You don’t know all the truth about something.	Tsy fantatrao ny marina rehetra momba ny zavatra iray.
Then he could no longer walk.	Dia tsy afaka nandeha intsony izy.
Is this book suitable for children?	Mety amin'ny ankizy ve ity boky ity?
Too much to lose.	Be loatra ny very.
Apparently not.	Toa tsy izany no izy.
He just doesn’t like it.	Tsy tiany fotsiny izany.
He helps many people.	Manampy olona maro izy.
I'm worried about that too.	Manahy momba izany koa aho.
In front with me.	Eo aloha miaraka amiko.
I read it.	Namaky izany aho.
Or from him.	Na avy aminy izy.
Clearly we have it.	Mazava fa manana izany.
It's right for you.	Mety aminao izany.
They are not some kind of thing.	Tsy karazana zavatra izy ireo.
He went hard all the time.	Nandeha mafy izy nandritra ny fotoana rehetra.
He was not alive when he saw it.	Tsy velona izy vao nahita izany.
He has been alone for a long time.	Efa ela izy no irery.
But they work.	Saingy miasa izy ireo.
You can learn, this.	Afaka mianatra ianao, ity.
And no.	Ary tsia.
He reads a lot.	Mamaky be izy.
It’s so good that it can’t be real.	Tena tsara fa tsy mety ho tena izy.
He never existed and never will.	Tsy nisy mihitsy izy ary tsy hisy mihitsy.
I doubt it’s one of us.	Misalasala aho fa iray aminay izany.
Don’t get confused.	Aza very hevitra.
He doesn't do that.	Tsy manao an’izany izy.
I'm not yours.	Tsy anao aho.
It seems so too.	Toa izany koa.
It scared him.	Natahotra azy izany.
This is very clear.	Mazava be izany.
I’m not sure why you don’t see it.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe nahoana ianao no tsy mahita izany.
He hoped that was it.	Nanantena izy fa izany no izy.
It’s about what could be a good thing.	Momba ny mety ho zavatra tsara izany.
I think that's what can be done.	Heveriko fa izay no mety hatao.
It's just a big house.	Trano lehibe fotsiny io.
I need to get two things.	Mila mahazo zavatra roa aho.
You say it for yourself.	Ianao no milaza izany ho anao.
Another night without dinner.	Alina hafa tsy misy sakafo hariva izao.
They decided.	Nanapa-kevitra izy ireo.
This is not entirely true.	Tsy marina tanteraka izany.
That sounds like a stupid question.	Toa fanontaniana adala izany.
Only one person in the house will do it.	Olona iray ao an-trano ihany no hanao izany.
He never said that.	Tsy nilaza izany mihitsy izy.
That money will be enough.	Ho ampy io vola io.
There is no question about that.	Tsy misy fanontaniana momba izany.
I would love to have one.	Tiako ny manana iray.
You are not doing very well today.	Tsy dia mandeha tsara ianao androany.
That could be a problem.	Mety ho olana izany.
And heard a few stories.	Ary nandre tantara vitsivitsy.
But it doesn’t seem that much harder.	Saingy tsy toy ny sarotra kokoa.
That would be a good thing.	Mety ho zavatra tsara izany.
I knew right away.	Tonga dia fantany aho.
I didn’t enjoy it.	Tsy nahafinaritra ahy izany.
It usually rains here during the summer.	Matetika ny orana eto rehefa fahavaratra.
We believe it is not.	Mino izahay fa tsy izany.
Above and beyond.	Ambony sy any ivelany.
Nowadays, this is easy to see.	Amin'izao andro izao dia mora ny mahita izany.
So it’s not there this year.	Ka tsy misy izany amin'ity taona ity.
It certainly didn’t rain last night.	Azo antoka fa tsy nisy orana omaly alina.
Don’t hesitate to ask what you don’t understand.	Aza misalasala manontany izay tsy azonao.
Otherwise, it is not.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy izany.
Of course, this is not true.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy marina izany.
I need it.	Mila izany aho.
He became a father.	Lasa ray izy.
It will not happen.	Tsy hitranga izany.
Yes, he may have an idea.	Eny, mety manana hevitra izy.
The problem is it doesn’t work.	Ny olana dia tsy mandeha io.
Sitting on the ground.	Mipetraka amin'ny tany.
Then he started playing himself.	Dia nanomboka nilalao ny tenany izy.
We were very surprised at that.	Tena gaga izahay tamin'izany.
I died then.	maty aho ary .
He looked at it, happy.	Nijery izany izy, faly.
Once they were too late.	Indray mandeha dia tara loatra izy ireo.
One thing he can do.	Zavatra iray azony atao.
It was a great time.	Fotoana lehibe izany.
Kind of good.	Karazana tsara.
He wanted something more, he wanted something else.	Naniry zavatra bebe kokoa izy, naniry zavatra hafa.
I think he just didn’t know what to do.	Heveriko fa tsy fantany fotsiny izay tokony hatao.
He doesn't look at her.	Tsy mijery azy izy.
Hard, fast and not too fancy.	Mafy, haingana ary tsy dia tsara tarehy.
It's not bad, but it's not good either.	Tsy ratsy ilay izy, nefa tsy dia tsara koa.
I often talk to people about it.	Matetika aho no miresaka amin’ny olona momba izany.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.
But it doesn’t work here.	Saingy tsy miasa eto.
It was long and bulky.	Lava sy be dia be ilay izy.
I've never seen anything like it.	Mbola tsy nahita tahaka an’izany mihitsy.
Yes, very long.	Eny, lava be.
He was asleep.	Natory izy.
He looked at himself.	Nijery ny tenany izy.
That can be really bad.	Mety ho tena ratsy tokoa izany.
We'll have someone here in a minute.	Hisy olona eto isika afaka iray minitra.
It is very possible.	Tena azo atao izany.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.	Raha manana fanontaniana ianao dia aza misalasala manontany.
I don't know where I'm going.	Tsy fantatro hoe ho aiza aho.
There is nothing special about it.	Tsy misy zavatra manokana momba izany.
I thought the man was talking at length.	Nieritreritra aho fa niresaka lava be ilay lehilahy.
Maybe something good is there.	Misy zavatra tsara angamba any.
We enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra anay izany.
We are surprised that this can happen.	Gaga izahay fa mety hitranga izany.
It refused to work.	Tsy nety niasa izany.
He will go a long way.	Ho lasa lavitra be izy.
He couldn't tell her, couldn't make her see it.	Tsy afaka nilaza taminy izy, tsy afaka nanao azy hahita izany.
I wonder if he came from home to check on me.	Manontany tena aho raha tonga avy any an-trano izy mba hijery ahy.
It will make the news.	Hanao ny vaovao izany.
So, that’s a big reason.	Noho izany, antony lehibe izany.
It's not done.	Tsy vita izany.
You knew that before.	Fantatrao teo aloha izany.
We waited there and waited.	Niandry teo izahay ary niandry.
Thanks so much again.	Misaotra betsaka indray.
You had to steal.	Nila nangalatra ianao.
He certainly did not.	Azo antoka fa tsy nanao izany izy.
He lived there for a few years.	Nipetraka tany nandritra ny taona vitsivitsy izy.
This is all true.	Marina daholo izany.
No, it's not.	Tsia, tsy izany.
He never did it when it didn’t come naturally.	Tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy rehefa tsy tonga ho azy.
We only have today.	Manana anio ihany isika.
This is the same.	Ity ihany.
We need more.	Mila bebe kokoa isika.
He wondered what had happened.	Nanontany tena izy hoe inona no nitranga tamin’izany.
And you are a big woman and not a girl.	Ary vehivavy lehibe ianao fa tsy tovovavy.
Will not enter here.	Tsy hiditra eto.
In fact, no one does that.	Raha ny marina, tsy manao izany na iza na iza.
Same as.	Mitovy amin'ny .
This is not wrong, and it is probably true.	Tsy diso izany, ary azo inoana fa marina tokoa.
You just watch and wait.	Mijery sy miandry fotsiny ianao.
I have never seen such a problem before.	Mbola tsy nahita olana mitovy amin'izany aho taloha.
I think they had a good age.	Heveriko fa nanana taona tsara izy ireo.
He no longer understood what had happened.	Tsy azony intsony ny zava-nitranga.
He knew it, even though he didn’t know it.	Fantany izany, na dia tsy fantany aza izany.
You will.	Hanao ianao.
Tell me what happened.	Lazao ahy izay nitranga.
I wondered if he was really scared.	Nanontany tena aho raha tena natahotra izy.
In a long time.	Tao anatin'ny fotoana ela.
Maybe he can’t.	Angamba tsy afaka izy.
But this is the problem.	Fa izao no olana.
It’s not just about having a good time.	Tsy momba ny fotoana mahafinaritra fotsiny izany.
He didn't seem to see me.	Toa tsy nahita ahy izy.
And no money, actually.	Ary tsy misy vola, raha ny marina.
The girl is very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy ilay tovovavy.
She wasn't happy to see him, she got it.	Tsy faly izy nahita azy, azony.
It was no different.	Tsy nisy hafa tamin'izany.
I spent a week there one night.	Nandany herinandro tany aho indray alina.
He certainly had not been there before.	Azo antoka fa mbola tsy tany izy taloha.
They are good players.	Mpilalao mahay izy ireo.
They asked him closely.	Nanontany azy akaiky izy ireo.
I'm trying hard.	Miezaka mafy aho.
Is it possible to travel in time?	Azo atao ve ny mandeha amin'ny fotoana?
Because I am yours.	Satria anao aho.
He doesn't like me.	Tsy tiany aho.
He wanted outside help.	Naniry izy fa hisy fanampiana avy any ivelany.
It's been a long time.	Efa ela be izao.
He wants to go back home.	Te hiverina any an-trano izy.
They are no longer here.	Tsy eto intsony izy ireo.
I just don’t know what.	Tsy fantatro fotsiny hoe inona.
It was very difficult to do so.	Tena sarotra ny nanao izany.
You really know them.	Tena mahafantatra azy ireo ianao.
I went back to talk to him about it.	Niverina niresaka taminy momba izany aho.
During this trip, he fell ill.	Nandritra io dia io dia narary izy.
Then you will do what is right for you.	Dia hanao izay mety aminao ianao.
It’s not a good movie.	Tsy sarimihetsika tsara izy io.
I can't say why.	Tsy afaka milaza ny antony aho.
That's where it is.	Eo no misy azy.
We did not ask for these issues.	Tsy nangataka ireo olana ireo izahay.
I’ve seen him before, many years ago.	Efa nahita azy aho taloha, taona maro lasa izay.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
Maybe we never did.	Angamba tsy nanao izany mihitsy isika.
It has all happened.	Efa nitranga daholo izany.
Over the past month.	Nandritra ny volana lasa.
He knew the car.	Fantany ilay fiara.
I don't believe that.	Tsy mino izany aho.
The children seemed happy.	Toa faly ny ankizy.
And you asked very well.	Ary nanontany tena tsara ianao.
Yes, maybe at first.	Eny, angamba tamin'ny voalohany.
You should do it after that.	Tokony hanao izany ianao rehefa afaka izany.
It all seemed like years to me.	Toa taona ho ahy izany rehetra izany.
The food here is small.	Kely ny sakafo eto.
He fell asleep while reading.	Renoky ny torimaso izy rehefa namaky.
I just entered.	vao niditra aho.
I think you will like it there.	Heveriko fa ho tianao izany any.
Did you wear special clothes?	Nanao akanjo manokana ve ianao?
However, we now believe this was a mistake.	Na izany aza, mino izahay ankehitriny fa fahadisoana izany.
This is not the place to do it.	Tsy toerana hanaovana izany ity.
I could not work.	Tsy afaka niasa aho.
A few weeks ago.	Herinandro vitsivitsy lasa izay.
It shouldn’t be like that.	Tsy tokony ho toy izany.
I never thought of that.	Mbola tsy nieritreritra izany mihitsy aho.
She was really expecting a man.	Nanantena lehilahy tokoa izy.
I came here to be with you.	Tonga eto aho mba hiaraka aminao.
I kept playing, but it was over.	Mbola nilalao foana aho, fa vita.
Children have many friends.	Manana namana maro ny ankizy.
On paper.	Ao amin'ny taratasy.
I still believe this is wrong.	Mbola mino aho fa diso izany.
I love reading.	Tiako ny mamaky.
We could no longer do that.	Tsy afaka nanao izany intsony izahay.
It was some kind of party or something.	Karazana fety na zavatra hafa ilay izy.
That’s how the money worked.	Toy izany no niasa ny vola.
History has done that.	Ny tantara no nanao izany.
Like anything you want.	Toy ny zavatra rehetra tianao.
He was on the ground.	Teo amin’ny tany izy.
He died after learning to read.	Maty izy rehefa avy nianatra namaky teny.
They are.	Izy ireo.
One way or another.	Fomba iray na hafa.
Any questions?	Misy fanontaniana?
It happened very quickly.	Nitranga haingana tokoa izany.
I'll talk to him while you watch.	Hiresaka aminy aho raha mbola mijery ianao.
I couldn't even think straight.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra tsara akory aho.
Instead, he looks at the earth.	Mijery ny tany kosa izy.
I am so happy and excited for you.	Tena faly sy faly ho anao aho.
More than a week ago.	Herinandro mahery lasa izay.
Either way, he was lost.	Na izany na tsy izany dia very izy.
Going to work.	Mandeha miasa.
He couldn't help but take a closer look.	Tsy afaka ny tsy hijery akaiky kokoa izy.
It was full of people.	Feno olona tao.
Good food for breakfast.	Sakafo tsara ho an'ny sakafo maraina.
Now it is not.	Ankehitriny dia tsy izany.
I'm crazy.	Adala aho.
Of course, they want to win.	Mazava ho azy fa te handresy izy ireo.
It’s just a little bit.	Somary fotsiny ilay izy.
I don't see where we are.	Tsy hitako izay misy anay.
But the big day is over.	Fa lasa ny andro lehibe.
That was the biggest thing that could have happened.	Izany no zavatra lehibe indrindra mety ho nitranga.
And he’s great, too.	Ary lehibe koa izy.
That’s a really good idea.	Hevitra tena tsara izany.
Sounds like a lot of money.	Toa vola be.
So don’t hesitate to ask!	Ka aza misalasala manontany!
I have to go fast.	Tsy maintsy mandeha haingana aho.
Some think he is still alive.	Misy mihevitra fa mbola velona izy.
He is very different now.	Tena hafa mihitsy izy izao.
I hope everyone had a great weekend.	Manantena aho fa nanana faran'ny herinandro mahafinaritra ny rehetra.
And his old room.	Ary ny efitranony taloha.
And yes, they sure are.	Ary eny, azo antoka izy ireo.
He wanted to.	Naniry izy.
He never talked about it.	Tsy niresaka momba izany mihitsy izy.
He seemed happy.	Toa faly izy.
It seemed real.	Toa tena nisy tokoa ilay izy.
This may seem silly, but it is very important.	Mety ho toa adala izany, nefa tena ilaina tokoa.
We’ve talked a bit.	Efa niresaka kely izahay.
He alone.	Izy ihany.
She and her children.	Izy sy ny zanany.
Then there you are.	Dia eo ianao.
I bought a new car today.	Nividy fiara vaovao aho androany.
They must be confused by now.	Tsy maintsy ho very hevitra izy ireo amin'izao fotoana izao.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.
They didn’t need to be long either.	Tsy nila ho lava koa izy ireo.
I still have a little over a month.	Mbola manana iray volana mahery kely aho.
It was a very important letter.	Tena taratasy lehibe tokoa ilay izy.
Everyone was scared.	Natahotra ny rehetra.
Because it really did exist.	Satria nisy tokoa izany.
He also did something wrong.	Nanao zavatra tsy ampy koa izy.
That should really help.	Tokony hanampy tokoa izany.
And that’s for a big reason.	Ary izany dia noho ny antony lehibe.
We will leave in an hour.	Hiala isika afaka adiny iray.
It’s nice to see people walking down the street not too far away.	Mahafinaritra ny mahita olona mandeha amin'ny lalana tsy dia lavitra loatra.
I just don’t like it.	Tsy tiako fotsiny.
He tried hard to win.	Niezaka mafy izy mba handresy.
They’ve been here before and they love it.	Efa teto izy ireo taloha ary tiany izany.

When you travel, you can’t carry everything.	Rehefa mandeha ianao dia tsy afaka mitondra ny zava-drehetra.
I was no more.	Tsy nisy ahy intsony.

These are not the same as men's.	Tsy mitovy amin’ny an’ny lehilahy ireo.
The ground was beautiful.	Nahafinaritra ny tany.
He could have waited.	Afaka niandry izy.
They always read it, it seems.	Namaky azy io foana izy ireo, toa.
Specific location unknown.	Toerana manokana tsy fantatra.
He had seen it before.	Efa nahita izany izy taloha.
What does it mean to own land.	Inona no atao hoe manana tany.
Too close.	Akaiky loatra.
You may be interested in.	Mety ho liana amin'ny.
He was wrong.	Diso hevitra izy.
We've talked about that before.	Efa niresaka an’izany izahay teo aloha.
There is nothing good about it.	Tsy misy zavatra tsara momba izany.
They really did exist.	Tena nisy tokoa izy ireo.
It took about two minutes.	Nandeha roa minitra teo ho eo izany.
He knew something was wrong.	Fantany fa misy zavatra tsy mety.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Inona, raha misy, no tsy mety?

So is he.	Izy koa izany.
I have to think about the future.	Tsy maintsy mieritreritra ny ho avy aho.

It’s hard for everyone maybe.	Sarotra ho an'ny rehetra angamba izany.
Oh really?	Marina ve izany?

There may be two main reasons.	Mety misy antony roa lehibe.

And it may not be.	Ary mety tsy izany.
I understand where you are, but you have to understand mine too.	Azoko tsara ny toerana misy anao, fa tsy maintsy azonao koa ny ahy.
Immediately it started to rain.	Avy hatrany dia nanomboka ny orana.
I had no food.	Tsy nanana sakafo aho.
And you.	Ary ianao.
Tomorrow is the last day for us here.	Rahampitso no andro farany ho antsika eto.
Sleep as late as you can.	Matory tara araka izay azonao atao.
Everyone needs to work on it.	Mila miasa amin’izany ny rehetra.
And don’t get me wrong, that’s what it is.	Ary aza diso hevitra fa izany no izy.
I don’t want to say anything else.	Tsy te hilaza zavatra hafa aho.
I'm sure you'll be out in a month or two.	Azoko antoka fa hivoaka ianao afaka iray na roa volana.
You can leave at any time if you are not happy.	Afaka miala amin'ny fotoana rehetra ianao raha tsy faly.
When the patient says no.	Rehefa miteny ny marary hoe tsia.
He was completely confused.	Very hevitra tanteraka izy.
When all goes well, there is nothing like it.	Rehefa mandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra dia tsy misy toa azy.
That could not be true.	Tsy mety ho marina izany.
There is for sure.	Misy azo antoka.
The man was not happy.	Tsy faly ilay lehilahy.
It was as if everyone was working in the same room.	Toy ny hoe niasa tao amin’ny efitrano iray ny rehetra.
We needed it from him.	Nila izany taminy izahay.
Night came and he immediately fell asleep.	Tonga ny alina ka tonga dia natory.
I know that very well.	Fantatro tsara izany.
This is one for me.	Ity dia iray ho ahy.
He looked at me.	Nijery ahy izy.
These kinds of things.	Ireo karazana zavatra ireo.
It looks sick.	Toa narary.
It will come.	Ho avy izany.
The problem already exists.	Efa misy izao ny olana.
He will stay with me.	Hijanona eto amiko izy.
New home.	Trano vaovao.
You can't do anything.	Tsy afaka manao na inona na inona ianao.
It went very fast.	Nandeha haingana be izany.
He loves it.	Tiany izany.
He will not help you.	Tsy hanampy anao izy.
Someone said he was angry with everyone.	Nisy nilaza fa tezitra tamin’ny rehetra izy.
You have to tell the truth.	Tsy maintsy milaza ny marina ianao.
I lost money.	Very vola aho.
I wouldn't even know now.	Tsy ho fantany akory aho izao.
We are good.	Tsara izahay.
No, that could not have happened.	Tsia, tsy nety ho nitranga izany.
Breakfast was plentiful and very good.	Be dia be ny sakafo maraina ary tena tsara.
Things could be good.	Mety ho tsara ny zavatra.
I'm not sure what he will do about it.	Tsy azoko antoka mihitsy izay hataony amin’izany.
There is something to be done about it as well.	Misy zavatra tokony hatao momba izany koa.
Everything seems far away.	Toa lavitra ny zava-drehetra.
We can be the same.	Mety ho toy izany koa isika.
There is a time and place for everything.	Misy fotoana sy toerana ny zava-drehetra.
And we are still very happy together.	Ary mbola faly be izahay miaraka.
Why does everyone speak so fast?	Nahoana ny olona rehetra no miteny haingana be?
I can't be late.	Tsy afaka tara aho.
I came back.	Niverina aho.
I’m pretty sure this is it.	Tena azoko antoka fa io no izy.
I do the same.	Izaho koa manao izany.
The sick child was lucky.	Tsara vintana ilay zaza narary.
He enjoyed working there.	Nahafinaritra azy ny niasa tao.
This is very dangerous.	Loza be izany.
They did something to him.	Nanao zavatra taminy izy ireo.
He knew he didn't.	Fantany fa tsy nanao izany izy.
There was something wrong.	Nisy zavatra tsy nety tao.
We will be back!	Hiverina izahay!
More often than not, they are different.	Matetika kokoa noho ny tsy, samy hafa izy ireo.
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
No, not good enough.	Tsia, tsy ampy tsara.
I am angry.	Tezitra aho.
And it might be a little annoying.	Ary mety ho tezitra kely.
A friend came to the house.	Nisy namana tonga tao an-trano.
He could not do that.	Tsy afaka nanao izany izy.
We hope you understand.	Manantena izahay fa azonao.
She could look at him with her heart.	Afaka nijery azy tamin’ny fony izy.
We have to look to the future.	Tsy maintsy mijery ny ho avy isika.
More than enough.	Mihoatra noho ny ampy.
Everything happens for a reason.	Misy antony ny zava-drehetra.
He shouldn’t have had to do that.	Tsy tokony ho voatery nanao izany izy.
I don't look at him.	Tsy mijery azy aho.
It’s very appropriate.	Tena mety izany.
And they are fun.	Ary mahafinaritra izy ireo.
Now, now is the time.	Ankehitriny, izao ny fotoana.
There's nothing he can do about it, really.	Tsy misy azony atao intsony amin'izany, tena izy.
It worked for me at the time.	Niasa tamiko izany tamin'izany fotoana izany.
They met at a party.	Nihaona tamin’ny fety izy ireo.
These men are probably gone.	Efa lasa angamba ireo lehilahy ireo.
I saw something.	Nahita zavatra aho.
It's a nice day.	Tsara izany andro izany.
A week ago, no one heard about him.	Herinandro lasa izay, tsy nisy nandre momba azy.
It was as if he had seen her.	Toy ny nahita azy izy.
I have never seen that before.	Mbola tsy nahita an'izany mihitsy aho androany.
You wanted it.	Naniry izany ianao.
I'm ready for that.	Efa vonona ho amin’izany aho.
They are with us.	Miaraka aminay izy ireo.
That's it! 	Izany no izy!
He doesn't see anything good.	Tsy mahita zavatra tsara izy.
Especially if you are new to this.	Indrindra raha vaovao ianao amin'ity.
Now, we can do it the easy way or the hard way.	Ankehitriny, afaka manao izany amin'ny fomba mora na amin'ny fomba sarotra isika.
Absolutely sick.	Marary tanteraka.
Of course it’s real.	Mazava ho azy fa ny tena izy.
What you want.	Izay tianao.
At this time he is not allowed to eat.	Amin'izao ora izao dia tsy mahazo mihinana izy.
He didn’t say but just took me.	Tsy niteny izy fa nitondra ahy fotsiny.
It's a little better now.	Somary tsara kokoa izao.
Of course, there is nothing like it.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy misy toa azy.
I try to do the right thing.	Miezaka manao ny tsara aho.
They never thought to leave.	Tsy nieritreritra ny hiala mihitsy izy ireo.
They are not very good.	Tsy dia tsara loatra izy ireo.
The same is true of others.	Toy izany koa ny hafa.
It was a wonderful time.	Fotoana nahafinaritra izany.
It’s hard, it’s hard.	Sarotra izany, sarotra izany.
But that’s not all.	Saingy tsy izany ihany.
Maybe we should all be like that.	Angamba isika rehetra dia tokony ho toy izany.
It was a great place.	Tena toerana tsara ilay izy.
No one had thought of doing the same before.	Tsy nisy nieritreritra ny hanao izany koa teo aloha.
That's not what I like.	Tsy izany no tiako.
For the night.	Ho an'ny alina.
He looked at her in surprise.	Gaga izy nijery azy.
You are ready to be free.	Vonona ny ho afaka ianao.
It's nothing.	Tsy inona izany.
We apologize.	Miala tsiny izahay.
Of course, he started out as an actor.	Mazava ho azy fa nanomboka ho mpilalao sarimihetsika izy.
Now there is a problem.	Ankehitriny dia misy olana.
And that’s why he didn’t have a chance.	Ary izany no nahatonga azy tsy nanana fahafahana.
He could now think.	Afaka nieritreritra izy izao.
Everything went wrong.	Tsy nety tsara ny zava-drehetra.
He saw two men coming out of the house as he entered.	Nahita lehilahy roa nivoaka ny trano izy rehefa niditra.
As it may be.	Araka ny mety ho izy.
It's better now.	Tsara kokoa izao.
Just waiting for the time.	Miandry ny fotoana fotsiny.
There is no time now.	Tsy misy fotoana izao.
To me, it doesn’t seem like much better, and often worse.	Amiko dia toa tsy tsara kokoa izany, ary matetika ratsy kokoa.
I told him the truth.	Nolazaiko taminy ny marina.
Of course it’s crazy.	Mazava ho azy fa adala.
He almost saw it.	Saika ho nahita izany izy.
Maybe it won’t be that bad.	Angamba tsy ho ratsy izany.
That's all.	Izay ihany.
No, that's not right.	Tsia, tsy mety izany.
He refused to leave.	Tsy nety niala izy.
And then there was the food.	Ary avy eo dia nisy ny sakafo.
Playing with other children.	Milalao miaraka amin'ny ankizy hafa.
He understood better.	Azony tsara kokoa.
I have been waiting a long time to do that.	Efa ela aho no niandry ny hanao izany.
We are not like you.	Tsy mba tahaka anao izahay.
I want to buy a house.	Te hividy trano aho.
I know the bad now.	Fantatro ny ratsy amin'izao fotoana izao.
It became a very beautiful thing.	Lasa zavatra tena tsara tarehy izany.
There is no such chance.	Tsy misy vintana toy izany.
I don't know why it doesn't work.	Tsy haiko ny antony tsy mety miasa.
And we were lucky to buy when we did.	Ary tsara vintana izahay nividy rehefa nanao izany.
That’s a good idea, actually.	Hevitra tsara izany, raha ny marina.
You can be anyone.	Afaka ny ho na iza na iza ianao.
I have no problem with it.	Tsy manana olana aminy aho.
We love you and are here for you.	Tia anao izahay ary eto ho anao.
It’s like just being at home.	Toy ny hoe ao an-trano ihany.
He’s just a nice guy.	Lehilahy mahafinaritra fotsiny izy.
It's a big house.	Trano lehibe izy io.
To him, however.	Aminy, na izany aza.
Well, it doesn’t matter.	Eny ary, tsy maninona izany.
The truth will come at the right time.	Ny marina dia ho tonga amin'ny fotoana mety.
When he returned, it was not going well.	Rehefa niverina izy dia tsy nandeha tsara.
He’s really smart, you know.	Tena mahay izy, fantatrao.
The day will be busy.	Ho be atao ny andro.
Many wonder who he is.	Maro no manontany tena hoe iza izy.
We don’t need to stay here.	Tsy mila mijanona eto isika.
You know that can’t happen.	Fantatrao fa tsy mety hitranga izany.
You can draw any picture you like.	Afaka manao sary izay tianao ianao.
She loved being with him.	Tiany niaraka taminy izy.
You are different.	Hafa ianao.
I think this is a first.	Heveriko fa voalohany izany.
Live to the end.	Velona hatramin'ny farany.
He studied it for a long time.	Nianatra azy nandritra ny fotoana ela izy.
What's that.	Inona izany.
He was angry with himself.	Tezitra tamin’ny tenany izy.
You have enough time.	Manana fotoana ampy ianao.
It will be the same here.	Ho toy izany koa ny eto.
I didn't get enough books.	Tsy nahazo boky ampy.
I don't believe that.	Tsy mino izany aho.
We’ll get all about it.	Hahazo ny rehetra momba izany izahay.
He drinks too much.	Misotro be loatra izy.
It was not immediate.	Tsy teo no ho eo izany.
The dress is nice.	Tsara ny akanjo.
All of this is very true.	Marina loatra izany rehetra izany.
He is a very good man.	Lehilahy tena tsara izy.
Maybe these will come in time.	Angamba ho avy amin'ny fotoana ireo.
Is anyone there?	Misy olona any ve?
When he returned, it was too late.	Rehefa niverina izy dia tara loatra.
I've been watching it for an hour.	Efa adiny iray aho no nijery azy.
A lot of money.	Vola be.
Things like this and that.	Zavatra toy izao sy izao.
She was scared.	Natahotra izy.
I don't know him very well.	Tsy fantatro tsara izy.
But this last method is not the same as the previous one.	Saingy ity fomba farany ity dia tsy mitovy amin'ny teo aloha.
He had to hold a big meeting.	Tsy maintsy nanao fivoriana lehibe izy.
It seems impossible at all.	Toa tsy azo atao mihitsy izany.
I hate it.	Tsy tiako izany.
I know exactly how it is.	Fantatro tsara hoe manao ahoana izany.
You really shouldn’t do that.	Tena tsy tokony hanao izany ianao.
She had never seen the man before.	Mbola tsy nahita an’io lehilahy io mihitsy izy.
You could be one of those people.	Mety ho iray amin'ireo olona ireo ianao.
But this thing.	Fa io zavatra io.
This is for the best.	Ity dia ho an'ny tsara indrindra.
It was all fun.	Nahafinaritra ny rehetra.
He was still reading.	Mbola namaky teny izy.
He was very surprised.	Gaga be izy.
We were just here for them.	Vao teto izahay ho azy ireo.
I will do something about him.	Hanao zavatra momba azy aho.
I learned a lot from him.	Nianatra zavatra betsaka taminy aho.
He is taller than me.	Lava lavitra ahy izy.
Don’t think about what happened last week.	Aza mieritreritra ny zava-nitranga tamin'ny herinandro lasa.
Everyone is fun to be with.	Mahafinaritra ny rehetra miaraka aminy.
I have to do something.	Tsy maintsy manao zavatra aho.
He looked at her.	Nijery azy izy.
But it can wait.	Saingy afaka miandry izany.
It is indeed one.	Iray tokoa izy io.
And here.	Ary eto.
We never leave here.	Tsy miala eto mihitsy isika.
We tried and tried and tried.	Nanandrana sy nanandrana ary nanandrana izahay.
Of course, this is not entirely true.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy marina tanteraka izany.
I'm sorry you don't care.	Miala tsiny aho fa tsy miraharaha izany ianao.
This is the real story.	Ity no tena tantara.
Hard.	Mafy.
When the time comes, he needs you.	Rehefa tonga ny fotoana dia mila anao izy.
I don’t know how he is.	Tsy fantatro hoe manao ahoana izy.
This has been until recently.	Izany dia hatramin'ny vao haingana.
I'm fine.	Tsy maninona aho.
You think you know about them.	Mihevitra ianao fa mahafantatra ny momba azy ireo.
You need to go.	Mila mandeha ianao.
And and then.	Ary ary ary.
It worked perfectly and worked fast.	Niasa tanteraka ary niasa haingana.
It should be pretty safe.	Tokony ho azo antoka tsara izany.
But not, you know, not often.	Saingy tsy, fantatrao, tsy matetika.
Of course, he didn't want to do that.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy te hanao izany izy.
This is a mistake.	Fahadisoana izany.
They have money.	Manana vola izy ireo.
Maybe he'll find her.	Angamba mety hahita azy izy.
They are used to that.	Efa zatra ny toy izany izy ireo.
Children often do this on special occasions.	Matetika ny ankizy no manao toy izany amin'ny fotoana manokana.
I got away with it.	Niala tamin'izany aho.
Yes, it is not.	Eny, tsy mety.
I'm afraid of him.	Matahotra azy aho.
You will not understand.	Tsy ho azonao.
i don't see that.	tsy hitako izay.
I loved working on it.	Tiako ny niasa tamin'izany.
There’s a lot they don’t know.	Betsaka ny zavatra tsy fantany.
Even true.	Marina aza.
He had nothing to do with it.	Tsy na inona na inona taminy izy.
We can't say anything.	Tsy afaka miteny na inona na inona izahay.
I should just do it.	Tokony hanao izany fotsiny aho.
On paper.	Ao amin'ny taratasy.
Me and you now.	Izaho sy ianao izao.
They are free.	Afaka izy ireo.
They still don’t.	Mbola tsy manao izany izy ireo.
Very big for him.	Tena lehibe ho azy.
I will be happy to help you today.	Ho faly aho hanampy anao anio.
There is danger in that.	Misy loza amin’izany.
The day is not lost yet.	Mbola tsy very ny andro.
Well, that's all for today.	Eny ary, izay ihany ny anio.
He is a man.	Lehilahy izy.
There is a lot to be gained.	Betsaka ny mety ho azo.
He has to do it himself.	Tsy maintsy manao izany ny tenany.
They got it.	Nahazo azy izy ireo.
Maybe not for hours, and maybe next time.	Angamba tsy mandritra ny ora maro, ary angamba amin'ny fotoana manaraka.
They are both alone.	Samy irery izy ireo.
Time went too fast alone.	Nandeha haingana loatra ny fotoana irery.
He knew he was dead.	Fantany fa maty izy.
They could not travel far because of these two cars.	Tsy afaka nandeha lavitra izy ireo noho ireo fiara roa ireo.
One.	Iray.
I have to get out of here.	Tsy maintsy miala eto aho.
He will not be able to walk alone.	Tsy ho afaka handeha irery izy.
I thought that was the right thing to do.	Nihevitra aho fa izany no tokony hatao.
He usually had no problems with women.	Matetika izy dia tsy nanana olana tamin'ny vehivavy.
These are the.	Ireo dia ny.
He was with me, though not far away.	Niaraka tamiko izy, na dia tsy lavitra aza.
He just didn’t like her.	Tonga dia tsy tia azy izy.
The car is new.	Vaovao ny fiara.
And maybe they did.	Ary angamba nanao izany izy ireo.
We never saw or heard of him again.	Tsy nisy nahita na nandre momba azy intsony izahay.
A little too much maybe.	Somary be loatra angamba.
He had it.	Nanana izany izy.
We drove to the main house.	Nandeha fiara nankany amin'ny trano lehibe izahay.
He would know if he had it.	Ho fantany raha nanana izany izy.
Bad for him.	Ratsy ho azy.
Everyone thought he would never come back.	Nihevitra ny rehetra fa tsy hiverina intsony izy.
It was really unpleasant.	Tena tsy nahafinaritra izany.
I love these stories.	Tiako ireo tantara ireo.
But, for now.	Saingy, amin'izao fotoana izao.
I told you what happened.	Nolazaiko anao ny zava-nitranga.
And there always will be.	Ary mbola hisy foana.
I ask again.	manontany indray aho.
You are good.	Tsara ianao.
This is kind of fun.	Ity dia karazana mahafinaritra.
You are a very good friend.	Tena namana tsara ianao.
He was always surprised.	Gaga foana izy.
Or something similar.	Na zavatra mitovy amin'izany.
Time passed.	Nandeha ny fotoana.
It’s good to know that they’re still around.	Tsara ho fantatra fa mbola any ho any izy ireo.
Not everything is easy for me now.	Tsy mora amiko izao ny zava-drehetra.
What to do.	Inona no tokony hatao.
He waited more.	Niandry bebe kokoa izy.
Do you believe these are true?	Mino ve ianao fa marina ireo?
We stayed for a week.	Nijanona herinandro izahay.
But it's not right.	Fa tsy mety.
We met often to talk about what had happened.	Nihaona matetika izahay, mba hiresaka momba ny zava-nitranga.
He was very nice to me.	Tena tsara tamiko izy.
Well done!	Vita tsara!
You could too.	Mety ho ianao koa.
It was all in the works, but it took time.	Izany rehetra izany dia tao anatin'ny asa, saingy nila fotoana.
But not anymore.	Saingy tsy izany intsony.
Wanted.	Naniry .
He was hopeful, though.	Nanantena izy, na izany aza.
Sounds like such a good idea.	Toa hevitra tsara toy izany.
If so, that is it.	Raha izany no izy dia izay no izy.
You live here alone.	Mipetraka irery eto ianao.
But not much.	Saingy tsy betsaka.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Te hiresaka momba izany ny rehetra.
He doesn't need to talk to me anymore.	Tsy mila miteny amiko intsony izy.
But when you think about it, it’s really fun.	Saingy rehefa mieritreritra an'izany ianao dia tena mahafinaritra tokoa izany.
No, he did it himself.	Tsia, nanao ny tenany izy.
He didn't tell anyone.	Tsy nilaza na iza na iza izy.
I have to stay there for now.	Tsy maintsy mijanona eo aho amin'izao fotoana izao.
I wanted you.	Naniry anao aho.
He still loves her.	Mbola tiany izy.
They have already done so.	Efa nanao izany izy ireo.
I did the same to him.	Toy izany koa no nataoko taminy.
Still looking good.	Mbola mijery tsara.
He doesn't understand.	Tsy azony.
The outside is the outside.	Ny ivelany dia ny ivelany.
I find that to be very true.	Hitako fa tena marina tokoa izany.
And they seem to work well.	Ary toa miasa tsara izy ireo.
I am the new girl.	Izaho ilay tovovavy vaovao.
Her children don’t like her very much.	Tsy dia tia azy loatra ny zanany.
They are in it.	Eo aminy izy ireo.
It's not done.	Tsy vita izany.
But first things first.	Fa ny zavatra voalohany aloha.
I don’t know how, but he is.	Tsy fantatro hoe ahoana, fa izy.
Now it could be anyone.	Ankehitriny dia mety ho na iza na iza.
I thought they were gone.	Nihevitra aho fa lasa izy ireo.
Commented in writing.	Nanome hevitra tamin'ny taratasy.
Don’t act fast.	Aza manao zavatra haingana.
That is not the way.	Tsy izany no lalana.
Many people called her “the most beautiful”.	Olona maro no nilaza azy ho "tsara tarehy indrindra".
Nothing like that will happen to you again.	Tsy hisy zavatra toy izany hitranga aminao intsony.
I didn’t like seeing him there.	Tsy tiako ny nahita azy tany.
We seem happy.	Toa faly izahay.
He often swore.	Matetika izy no niteny ratsy.
It really did exist.	Tena nisy tokoa izany.
If you think you’re surprised.	Raha heverinao fa gaga ianao.
He said it was good.	Nilaza izy fa tsara izany.
Yes, that’s the only kind of thing he’ll do.	Eny, izany ihany no karazana zavatra hataony.
And then the best thing happened.	Ary dia nitranga ny zavatra tsara indrindra.
It still went well.	Mbola nandeha tsara ihany.
And he still drinks.	Ary mbola misotro ihany izy.
The car was going fast.	Nandeha mafy ilay fiara.
But you won’t do that.	Saingy tsy hanao izany ianao.
If we lose, that is the end.	Raha very isika dia izay no farany.
He had to do something.	Tsy maintsy nanao zavatra izy.
But it doesn’t matter.	Saingy tsy maninona izany.
This has never happened to me.	Mbola tsy nitranga tamiko mihitsy izany.
And they don’t know that you know.	Ary tsy fantany fa fantatrao.
There was no water at all.	Tsy nisy rano mihitsy.
Not long ago.	Tsy ela izay.
You have to stop.	Tsy maintsy mijanona ianao.
I'm sick of you.	Marary anao aho.
He is not happy.	Tsy faly izy.
Because that's what he's going to do.	Satria izay no hataony.
Everything is so beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy daholo.
I had a picture.	Nisy sary ahy.
And the next night, and the next too.	Ary ny alina manaraka, ary ny manaraka koa.
He then made food for us.	Nanao sakafo ho anay izy avy eo.
And that might say something.	Ary mety hilaza zavatra izany.
I'm really scared of him.	Tena matahotra azy aho.
Now they just look crazy.	Ankehitriny dia toa adala fotsiny izy ireo.
You haven't met him yet.	Mbola tsy nihaona taminy ianao.
Don't talk.	Aza miteny.
He wanted another but thought better.	Naniry hafa izy nefa nieritreritra tsara kokoa.
They should be within a day.	Tokony ho ao anatin'ny iray andro izy ireo.
Don't do that, please.	Aza manao toy izany, azafady.
Now they are the same.	Ankehitriny dia mitovy izy ireo.
And we have heard it.	Ary efa nandre azy izahay.
He apologized and sat down.	Niala tsiny izy ary nipetraka.
Only the woman is known.	Ilay vehivavy ihany no fantatra.
The problem is the same here.	Mitovy ny olana eto.
Not because he’s grown up.	Tsy noho izy efa lehibe.
So much more than that.	Be lavitra noho izany.
He wasted no time, said nothing.	Tsy nandany fotoana izy, tsy niteny na inona na inona.
Then he woke up.	Dia nahatsiaro izy.
I have a lot of money.	Manana vola be aho.
Say it all.	Lazao daholo.
Upstairs is upstairs.	Any ambony dia ambony.
Not yet.	Tsy mbola.
It won’t be a few days.	Tsy ho andro vitsivitsy izany.
It seems to have come out now.	Toa efa nivoaka izany ankehitriny.
He had called her that before.	Efa niantso azy toy izany izy taloha.
I got nothing, man.	Tsy nahazo na inona na inona aho, lehilahy.
You have to be very close.	Tokony ho tena akaiky ianao.
Another woman and two men came out.	Nisy vehivavy hafa sy lehilahy roa nivoaka.
The letter had its history, however.	Ny taratasy dia nanana ny tantara, na izany aza.
Even in the same room.	Ao amin'ny efitrano iray ihany aza.
But it works really well.	Fa tena miasa tsara.
I can look for a new job.	Afaka mitady asa vaovao aho.
Now, that’s when it’s ready.	Ankehitriny, dia rehefa vonona izany.
Others are a little outside.	Ny hafa dia kely any ivelany.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
And they can go without me for a few days.	Ary afaka mandeha tsy misy ahy izy ireo mandritra ny andro vitsivitsy.
Never say you are incompetent.	Aza miteny mihitsy hoe tsy mahay ianao.
And it's been a long time.	Ary efa ela be.
Otherwise, she’s pretty.	Raha tsy izany, tena tsara tarehy izy.
No one told the story.	Tsy nisy nilaza ny tantara.
There is only one way.	Iray ihany ny fomba azo atao.
It works for us.	Miasa ho antsika izany.
Maybe he knows that you will eventually find the truth.	Angamba fantany fa hahita ny marina ianao amin’ny farany.
He might do a good job.	Mety hanao asa tsara izy.
He himself told us.	Izy mihitsy no nilaza taminay.
Very happy to be here.	Tena faly ny tonga eto.
He did it alone, no one told him.	Izy irery no nanao izany, tsy nisy niteny taminy.
Absolutely not.	Tena tsy izany.
All these people had to go somewhere.	Tsy maintsy nandeha tany ho any ireo olona rehetra ireo.
Although most likely they are.	Na dia azo inoana aza fa izy ireo.
Even now he doesn’t know why.	Na ankehitriny aza dia tsy fantany ny antony.
There is only one problem.	Iray ihany ny olana.
This is not a good idea.	Tsy hevitra tsara izany.
There it is.	Ao izany.
It was really hard to watch it.	Tena sarotra ny nijery an'io.
Don't let anyone tell you anything else.	Aza avela hisy hilaza zavatra hafa aminao.
They were fun.	Nahafinaritra azy ireo.
I don’t know why I bought them.	Tsy fantatro ny antony nividy azy ireo.
I don’t know why, but it was fun.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana, fa nahafinaritra izany.
This is a mistake.	Fahadisoana izany.
I never said that.	Tsy nilaza izany mihitsy aho.
You should go if you can.	Tokony handeha ianao raha afaka.
She is beautiful.	Izy no tsara tarehy.
I think that's okay.	Heveriko fa mety izany.
Wrong to be here.	Diso ny tokony ho eto.
But we still had to figure out how.	Saingy mbola tsy maintsy nieritreritra ny fomba.
That is, women.	Izany hoe vehivavy izany.
You were still sleeping at home.	Mbola natory tao an-trano ianao.
I don’t like that idea at all.	Tsy tiako mihitsy izany hevitra izany.
You don’t have to.	Tsy manana ianao.
This is wrong.	Diso izany.
Which of course they are not.	Izay mazava ho azy fa tsy izy ireo.
I drink water.	misotro rano aho.
He said there was a lot of truth.	Nilaza izy fa betsaka ny marina.
I will survive, of course.	Ho velona aho, mazava ho azy.
At the right time.	Amin'ny fotoana mety.
Nothing can be done.	Tsy misy zavatra azo atao.
They are not pretty.	Tsy tsara tarehy izy ireo.
In those days.	Tamin'izany andro izany.
I have never had a chance to return to the room.	Mbola tsy nanana fahafahana niverina tao amin'ny efitrano mihitsy aho.
You tried hard.	Niezaka mafy ianao.
Don’t get your point across.	Aza azonao ny hevitrao.
He’s small and plays a little.	Kely izy ary milalao kely.
I really can’t be enough.	Tena tsy afaka ny ho ampy aho.
It certainly won’t be easy.	Azo antoka fa tsy ho mora izany.
It’s not bad, it’s not very good.	Tsy ratsy izany, tsy dia tsara loatra.
I am so happy to have the opportunity.	Tena faly aho manana fahafahana.
People know me.	Fantatry ny olona aho.
That's what it is.	Izany no izy.
That’s a lot.	Be dia be izany.
It’s easy to leave.	Mora ny miala.
And in more ways than one.	Ary amin'ny fomba mihoatra ny iray.
Then it becomes real.	Lasa tena izy io rehefa avy eo.
I never stopped there.	Tsy nijanona tao mihitsy aho.
No one was here but we were here.	Tsy nisy olona teto fa izahay teto.
I think you will like it too.	Heveriko fa ho tianao koa izany.
Maybe, you have nothing to lose.	Angamba, tsy misy ho very ianao.
The idea worked perfectly.	Niasa tanteraka ilay hevitra.
More often than not it is not.	Matetika kokoa noho izany tsy.
But he did not speak.	Nefa tsy niteny izy.
He is no longer like that.	Tsy toy izany intsony izy.
Which is one thing.	Izay zavatra iray.
I know they have nothing to do with me.	Fantatro fa tsy manana na inona na inona amiko izy ireo.
This should not be done.	Tsy tokony hatao izany.
This is safe and appropriate.	Ity dia azo antoka ary mety.
I haven't seen you in a long time.	Efa ela aho no tsy nahita anao ary.
Two men and a dog.	Lehilahy roa sy alika iray.
I studied drawing.	Nianatra sary aho.
I love doing it.	Tiako ny manao azy.

He could be really good.	Mety ho tena tsara izy.
It's raining a lot.	Be ny orana.
You don't even have to talk to him.	Tsy mila miresaka aminy akory ianao.
They have to do something about it.	Tsy maintsy manao zavatra momba izany izy ireo.
It is still there.	Mbola foana ilay izy.
It both works.	Samy miasa izy io.
When they asked why, he said he needed to eat.	Rehefa nanontany ny antony izy ireo dia nilaza izy fa mila mihinana.
Maybe they know something.	Angamba mahafantatra zavatra izy ireo.
It is in a good location.	Tsara ny toerana misy azy.
He asked me for money.	Nangataka vola tamiko izy.
I looked at him but not at me.	Nijery azy aho fa tsy nijery ahy.
And that's what happened.	Dia izay no nitranga.
No, more than good.	Tsia, mihoatra noho ny tsara.
This has happened before.	Efa nitranga izany teo aloha.
They are two different types.	Karazana roa samy hafa izy ireo.
There was none.	Tsy nisy teo.
I wonder what this dress is in the end.	Manontany tena aho hoe inona ity akanjo ity amin'ny farany.
But that is not enough.	Saingy tsy ampy izany.
It's the same.	Toy izany ihany.
I saw him.	Hitako izy.
There is such a place.	Misy toerana toy izany.
Another better way.	Fomba hafa tsara kokoa.
He did not write to her.	Tsy nanoratra taminy izy.
You can never speak.	Tsy mahay miteny mihitsy ianao.
This really isn’t the best idea.	Tena tsy izany no hevitra tsara indrindra.
It wasn’t that far back in the past.	Tsy hoe lavitra loatra izany taloha.
I don't fit in at all.	Tsy mety amin'ny ahy mihitsy aho.
Can anyone help me if there isn't.	Misy afaka manampy ahy ve raha tsy misy.
Maybe he was sick.	Narary angamba izy.
That's enough for me.	Ampy ahy izany.
Finally, the time came.	Farany, tonga ny fotoana.
This is new to me.	Vaovao ho ahy ity.
Big problem.	Olana lehibe.
Like more than all of these things.	Toy ny mihoatra noho ireo zavatra rehetra ireo.
From morning to evening we drove.	Nanomboka tamin'ny maraina ka hatramin'ny hariva dia nandeha fiara izahay.
Not theirs.	Tsy azy ireo.
Lots of questions.	Betsaka ny fanontaniana.
Pictures should be more than talking.	Ny sary dia tokony mihoatra noho ny miresaka.
I wanted to get away from him.	Naniry ny hiala taminy aho.
It was definitely a real dinner.	Azo antoka fa tena sakafo hariva izany.
I needed a safe place.	Nila toerana azo antoka aho.
They want to be sure.	Te hahazo antoka izy ireo.
To be there for me.	Mba ho eo ho ahy.
I can get something now.	Afaka mahazo zavatra aho izao.
It must have been fun.	Tsy maintsy ho nahafinaritra izany.
It’s gone.	Lasa izy io.
No, she is more beautiful.	Tsia, tsara tarehy kokoa izy.
They were afraid of being wrong.	Natahotra ny ho diso izy ireo.
Right here.	Eto mihitsy.
He worked hard, but he did not earn much money.	Niasa mafy izy, nefa tsy nahazo vola be.
No one spoke to me like you.	Tsy nisy niteny tamiko toa anao.
He knows what to do.	Fantany izay tokony hatao.
They are women and men.	Vehivavy sy lehilahy izy ireo.
These are busy times.	Fotoana be atao ireo.
There is a lot of light to me.	Be dia be ny mazava amiko.
But for dinner.	Fa ny sakafo hariva.
It’s really hard.	Tena sarotra izany.
I don’t want to be.	Tsy tiako ny ho.
Others, follow him.	Ny hafa, manaraka azy.
I talked to him.	Niresaka taminy aho.
I must be crazy! 	Tsy maintsy ho adala aho!
, as you wish.	, araka izay tianao.
Or sick.	Na marary.
He went there.	Nankany izy.
And a little something else like that.	Ary zavatra kely hafa toy izany.
That's what he did for himself.	Izany no asa nataony ho an’ny tenany.
The risks of this are non -existent.	Ny loza mety hitranga amin'izany dia tsy misy.
We have it, and here we are.	Manana izany izahay, ary eto izahay.
There is nothing like it.	Tsy misy mitovy amin'izany.
Maybe, something was wrong with me.	Angamba, nisy zavatra tsy nety tamiko.
It was hard for him to say that.	Sarotra taminy ny nilaza izany.
Which is good for me.	Izay tsara amiko.
It was a difficult time for us outside.	Fotoana sarotra taminay tany ivelany izany.
He doesn’t live here, and he’s not like her.	Tsy mipetraka eto izy, ary tsy mitovy aminy.

Lots to ask.	Betsaka ny manontany.
Tell me you love me.	Lazao ahy fa tia ahy ianao.
The two did not.	Tsy nanao izany ny roa.
It was a perfect fit.	Tena nety tsara ilay izy.
i can't.	tsy vitako.
Now, friends.	Ankehitriny, namana.
But it is yet to come.	Fa mbola ho avy.
Someone must have told you.	Tsy maintsy nisy nilaza taminao.
This is a difficult problem.	Olana sarotra izany.
I soon started writing.	Tsy ela aho dia nanomboka nanoratra.
She is.	Izy dia.
We need a new place.	Mila toerana vaovao isika.
Fun stuff.	Zavatra mahafinaritra.
Yesterday was a wonderful day.	Nahafinaritra ny andro omaly.
Children sleep well.	Matory tsara ny ankizy.
It is the last day.	Andro farany izy izao.
He just wasn’t ready to see it.	Tsy vonona ny hahita izany fotsiny izy.
He wondered if he knew what it was.	Nanontany tena izy raha fantany hoe inona izany.
A man is a man.	Lehilahy dia lehilahy.
Once you’re logged in, you’re logged in.	Raha vao niditra ianao dia niditra.
This is the last time I did it.	Ity no fotoana farany nataoko.
And it's just water.	Ary rano ihany izany.
But tell me now.	Fa lazao ahy izao.
There was none.	Tsy nisy izany.
You will be surprised.	Ho gaga ianao.
He will be here tomorrow.	Ho avy eto izy rahampitso.
Roads, things, but nothing.	Lalana, zavatra, fa tsy nisy na inona na inona.
If you’re not really, don’t worry.	Raha tsy tena ianao dia aza manahy.
I needed to talk to him.	Nila niresaka taminy aho.
I’m happy to talk about it more.	Faly aho hiresaka momba izany bebe kokoa.
I was very happy about that.	Tena faly aho tamin'izany.
He began to speak.	Nanomboka niteny izy.
But others had other ideas.	Fa ny hafa kosa nanana hevitra hafa.
And opportunity comes first.	Ary ny fahafahana no tonga voalohany.
There is very little.	Tsy misy na kely dia kely.
A man once wrote me a letter.	Nisy lehilahy nanoratra taratasy ho ahy indray mandeha.
They talked about everything.	Niresaka ny zava-drehetra izy ireo.
This is a real danger.	Tena loza tokoa izany.
You guys both have.	Samy manana ianareo lehilahy.
This is good news.	Vaovao tsara izany.
No one knows what happened.	Tsy misy mahalala ny zava-nitranga.
No one ate.	Tsy nisy nihinana.
Because it’s about me.	Satria momba ahy izany.
He will travel far.	Hanao dia lavitra izy.
Does anyone think this is a bad idea ?.	Misy mihevitra fa hevitra ratsy izany?.
And the song.	Ary ny hira.
What do you think helps?	Inona no manampy araka ny hevitrao?
Three people entered the room.	Olona telo no niditra tao amin’ity efitrano ity.
I really like him.	Tena tiako izy.
We will go the other way.	Hivoaka amin'ny lalana hafa izahay.
When he dies.	Rehefa maty izy.
I don’t know what’s missing.	Tsy fantatro izay tsy ampy.
I have a great day coming up.	Manana andro lehibe ho avy aho.
There is very little time to do things.	Kely dia kely ny fotoana hanaovana zavatra.
They don’t say anything and it’s been raining for a week.	Tsy miteny na inona na inona izy ireo ary avy ny orana mandritra ny herinandro.
Not something like that, he won’t do it.	Tsy zavatra toy izany, tsy hanao izany izy.
Because he worked so hard, apparently.	Satria niasa be izy, toa.
They are very easy to work with.	Mora miasa be izy ireo.
Either way or both is good.	Na ny roa na ny roa dia tsara.
Good if something goes well.	Tsara raha misy zavatra mandeha tsara.
Others, not too much.	Ny hafa, tsy dia be loatra.
I can think of many things about that.	Afaka mieritreritra zavatra maro momba izany aho.
That’s probably what should be done at the end of the year.	Izany angamba no tokony hatao amin'ny faran'ny taona.
The time has not yet come to do so.	Mbola tsy tonga ny fotoana hanaovana izany.
He must be afraid of you.	Tsy maintsy matahotra anao izy.
I saw him, in the car.	Izaho no nahita azy, tao anaty fiara.

I have two more things for you.	Manana zavatra roa hafa ho anao aho.
The question of how much the former will cost is unclear.	Tsy mazava ny fanontaniana hoe ohatrinona ny teo aloha.
I told him things, not the truth.	Nolazaiko azy ny zavatra, fa tsy ny marina.
I was planning to do it tonight.	Nikasa ny hanao izany aho anio alina.
We will soon be on a long night trip.	Tsy ho ela isika dia hanao dia lavitra amin'ny alina.
Such a man has gone too far.	Ny lehilahy toy izany dia lasa lavitra loatra.
All this is well known.	Izany rehetra izany dia fantatra tsara.

Got it working.	Nahazo izany miasa.
I am me.	Izaho dia izaho.

So it is here.	Toy izany ny eto.
She wears long clothes when she works.	Manao akanjo lava izy rehefa miasa.
He was surprised.	Gaga izy.
I didn't see what was waiting for me.	Tsy hitako izay niandry ahy.
That's enough.	Ampy izany.
We needed it.	Nila izany izahay.
I don’t want to be unclear.	Tsy te ho tsy mazava.
They just walk away.	Tonga dia mandeha fotsiny izy ireo.
I need a little.	Mila kely aho.
Not personal, of course.	Tsy manokana, mazava ho azy.
Ready when you are ready.	Vonona raha vao vonona ianao.
Don't go too far.	Aza mandeha lavitra.
It may seem impossible now, but it may one day.	Mety ho toa tsy azo atao izany ankehitriny, fa mety indray andro any.
It is needed quickly.	Haingana dia ilaina izany.
I'll stay with you for a while then.	Hijanona kely aminao aho avy eo.
Because they are.	Satria izy ireo.
There are only three of them.	Telo ihany izy ireo.
You love him.	Tia azy ianao.
He was very good at it.	Tena nahay tamin’izany izy.
It could all be you.	Mety ho anao izany rehetra izany.
It is so.	Dia toy izany.
I think there are two reasons here.	Heveriko fa misy antony roa eto.
I was angry to say that.	Tezitra aho no nilaza izany.
What caused it.	Inona no nahatonga izany.
Time passed.	Nandeha ny fotoana.
He could come and go as he pleased.	Afaka tonga sy nandeha araka izay tiany izy.
He wanted it.	Naniry izany izy.
It was still there.	Mbola teo ihany ilay izy.
Of course he liked it.	Mazava ho azy fa tiany izany.
He came here yesterday.	Tonga teto izy omaly.
With that you are.	Amin'izany ianao.
There were a lot of people there.	Nisy olona be dia be tao.
He loved her.	Tiany izy.
But you know.	Fa fantatrao .
I may not have been there either.	Mety tsy teo koa aho.
He was just telling the truth.	Nilaza ny marina fotsiny izy.
I'm not doing very well today.	Tsy dia mandeha tsara aho androany.
He sat there.	Nipetraka teo izy.
I have been there once.	Efa tany aho indray mandeha.
I'm not looking sick.	Tsy mitady ho marary aho.
He completed the journey.	Nahavita ny dia izy.
I believe this is one of the first.	Mino aho fa iray amin'ireo voalohany io.
But he did the same thing.	Fa toy izany koa no nataony.
Do you really want to do that?	Tena te hanao izany ve ianao?
The man was not in the other room either.	Tsy tao amin’ny efitrano hafa koa ilay lehilahy.
We talk a lot.	Miresaka be izahay.
There are too many problems.	Be loatra ny olana.
Too much for men.	Be loatra ho an'ny lehilahy.
I really like this thing !.	Tena tiako ity zavatra ity!.
Not too long ago.	Tsy ela akory izay.
He knows when they do things and why.	Fantany hoe rahoviana izy ireo no manao zavatra ary nahoana.
They are not together.	Tsy miaraka izy ireo.
I thought about it.	Nieritreritra an'izany aho.
They had to do what they had to do.	Tsy maintsy nanao izay tsy maintsy nataony izy ireo.
We did nothing to him.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona taminy izahay.
There is no such thing.	Tsy misy toy izany.
He is not in this house.	Tsy ao amin'ity trano ity izy.
This party is going well!	Mandeha tsara ity fety ity!
It’s really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra izany.
He was wrong.	Diso izy.

There is nothing good about it.	Tsy misy zavatra tsara azo avy amin’izany.
He went crazy.	Dia lasa adala.
It is us.	Isika io.
You look good too.	Mijery tsara koa ianao.
He will do nothing.	Tsy hanao na inona na inona izy.
It’s one of my favorite things to do.	Iray amin'ireo zavatra tiako indrindra atao izany.
I need your opinion on that.	Mba mila hevitrao momba izany aho.
But then.	Fa avy eo.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
I really like the book.	Tena tiako ilay boky.
Like this.	Toa izao.
The book will be something else over time.	Ny boky dia ho zavatra hafa rehefa mandeha ny fotoana.
It could be a sleepless night.	Mety ho ny alina tsy nisy torimaso.
I’m really glad you do.	Tena faly aho raha manao izany ianao.
He did not speak for long.	Tsy niteny ela izy.

We won’t talk about that anymore.	Tsy hiresaka izany intsony isika.

You decided that was enough.	Nanapa-kevitra ianao fa ampy izay.

He still does.	Mbola manao izany izy.
And there isn’t.	Ary tsy misy izany.

Now seems to be the wrong time.	Toa tsy mety mihitsy izao ny fotoana.
I really like it.	Tena tiako izany.
Or many other things.	Na zavatra maro hafa.
This path is going well.	Ity lalana ity dia mandeha tsara.
Something goes wrong, you die.	Misy zavatra tsy mandeha, maty ianao.
There was no way there.	Tsy nisy lalana teo.
This might be good.	Mety ho tsara izao.
I need it now.	Mila izany aho izao.
I looked at him.	Nijery azy aho.
This is not the right path.	Tsy izany no lalana mety.
He often had other ideas.	Matetika izy no nanana hevitra hafa.
The baby is ready, woman.	Vonona ny zaza, vehivavy.
I hope he’s not too angry yet.	Manantena aho fa tsy mbola tezitra mafy izy.
We did the right thing.	Nanao ny tsara izahay.
But not luck.	Fa tsy vintana.
These people don’t.	Tsy manao izany ireo olona ireo.
They work well and work well.	Miasa tsara izy ireo ary miasa tsara.
The question is whether you exist or not.	Ny fanontaniana dia hoe misy ianao na tsia.
He was often away from home at night.	Matetika izy no tsy tao an-trano tamin’ny alina.
And with that comes a lot of problems.	Ary miaraka amin'izany dia misy olana maro.
She looks beautiful.	Toa tsara tarehy izy.
To do so just because.	Mba hanaovana izany satria fotsiny.
i don't have.	tsy manana aho.
The history teacher is almost done.	Efa saika vita ny mpampianatra tantara.
And me.	Sy izaho.
They love their children.	Tia ny zanany izy ireo.
I'm fine with that.	Tsy maninona aho amin'izany.
They said we needed help.	Nilaza izy ireo fa mila fanampiana izahay.
I haven't got it either.	Izaho koa tsy mbola nahazo.
Either way, that’s the least of his problems.	Na izany na tsy izany, izany no kely indrindra amin'ny olana misy azy.
Not many, that’s for sure.	Tsy maro, azo antoka izany.
In fact, not every hour.	Raha ny marina, tsy amin'ny ora rehetra.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.	Manantena ny hahita anao indray aho.
I’m glad it happened.	Faly aho fa nitranga ny zava-nitranga.
And he ate it.	Dia nihinana izany izy.
Nice to meet you.	Faly mahafantatra anao.
The following.	Ity manaraka ity.
It worked for the first time.	Niasa tamin'ny fotoana voalohany izany.
There are so many little things.	Be dia be ny zavatra kely.
The previous one, a week ago, was bad.	Ilay teo aloha, herinandro lasa izay, dia ratsy.
They have nothing.	Tsy manana na inona na inona izy ireo.
Maybe the same two.	Angamba izy roa ihany.
I don't want to leave.	Tsy te hiala aho.
It has always been like that.	Efa toy izany hatrany.
We need everyone to be with us.	Mila ny rehetra hiaraka aminay izahay.
I love him.	Izaho no tia azy.
They seem real.	Toa tena misy izy ireo.

Here they will talk about the problem.	Eto izy ireo dia hiresaka momba ny olana.
You will be home soon.	Hody tsy ho ela ianao.
He doesn’t want to talk to you, you know.	Tsy tiany ny miresaka aminao, fantatrao.
He is gone.	Lasa izy.
I think we are good enough.	Heveriko fa ampy tsara isika.
absolutely!	tanteraka!
How are you again.	Manao ahoana indray.
But you don’t know it and you won’t do it.	Saingy tsy fantatrao izany ary tsy hanao izany ianao.
He once talked about her.	Niresaka momba azy izy indray mandeha.
I think that.	Mihevitra aho fa.
And in fact, you had to apologize to him yesterday.	Ary raha ny marina, tsy maintsy miala tsiny aminy ianao omaly.
I've had enough.	Efa ampy aho.
And everything else follows.	Ary ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia manaraka izany.
But it will be good.	Fa ho tsara izany.
He started to have better ideas.	Nanomboka nanana hevitra tsara kokoa izy.
He wrote.	Nanoratra izy.
There was plenty of space for everything.	Nisy toerana be dia be ho an'ny zava-drehetra.
I see this as the biggest problem.	Hitako ho olana lehibe indrindra izany.
He will understand it well.	Ho azony tsara izany.
However.	Na izany aza.
This is the more difficult problem.	Ity no olana sarotra kokoa.
I went fast.	Nandeha haingana aho.
It will be something.	Ho zavatra izany.
I'm really into him.	Tena ho azy aho.
The big, the small.	Ny lehibe, ny kely.
But he already knew.	Fa efa fantany.
He has never had anyone left alone here.	Mbola tsy nanana olona nijanona irery teto izy.
You should be the same.	Tokony ho toy izany koa ianao.
Since no one had, he was not at breakfast.	Satria tsy nisy nanana, dia tsy teo amin'ny sakafo maraina izy.
He does, and he certainly does.	Manao izany izy, ary azo antoka fa misy.
I'm so glad I finally met you.	Tena faly aho nihaona taminao tamin'ny farany.
It’s not a bad thing, far from it.	Tsy zavatra ratsy izany, lavitra izany.
This can be done in two ways.	Azo atao amin'ny fomba roa izany.
I may be wrong now.	Mety ho diso aho izao.
He never told me.	Tsy nilaza tamiko mihitsy izy.
I haven't done that yet.	Tsy mbola nanao izany aho.
I do not.	Tsy manao izany aho.
He may know himself, but he doesn’t talk about it.	Mety mahafantatra ny tenany izy, nefa tsy miresaka momba izany.
It may be on the right track.	Mety ho amin'ny lalana marina izany.
The baby is fine.	Tsara ilay zaza.
No one had ever feared me before.	Mbola tsy nisy natahotra ahy mihitsy teo aloha.
We thought you were lost.	Nihevitra izahay fa very anao.
Don't make me sick, please.	Aza avela ho marary aho, azafady.
No, that's crazy.	Tsia, adala izany.
You got me there.	Nahazo ahy tany ianao.
That's enough.	Ampy izay.
And this is what he did.	Ary izao no nataony.
Better than nothing, for sure.	Tsara kokoa noho ny tsy misy, azo antoka.
But it may not be.	Saingy mety tsy izany.
They don’t tell you that.	Tsy milaza izany aminao izy ireo.
You saw the room.	Nahita ny efitrano ianao.
He might have gone.	Mety ho nandeha izy.
And it works well with it.	Ary miasa tsara amin'izany.
If he did.	Raha nanao izany izy.
He entered his room.	Niditra tao amin’ny efitranony izy.
I have to do it.	Tsy maintsy manao izany aho.
A clear year to come.	Taona mazava ho avy.
Even people close to you.	Na ny olona akaiky anao aza.
He went too fast.	Nandeha haingana loatra izy.
He often comes here to talk about her.	Matetika izy no tonga eto, mba hiresaka momba azy.
It has to be done.	Tokony hatao izany.
Some even go away in a matter of months.	Misy aza tonga dia mandeha ao anatin’ny volana vitsivitsy.
He wants to travel far abroad.	Te hanao dia lavitra any ivelany izy.
I will see it to the end.	Ho hitako hatramin'ny farany izany.
I still didn’t have a house of my own.	Mbola tsy nanana trano manokana aho.
He used to do it for himself when he wanted something.	Nanao izany ho azy izy taloha rehefa naniry zavatra.
He was very sick.	Narary mafy izy.
He could not do enough for her.	Tsy afaka nanao izay ampy ho azy izy.
He did it himself.	Izy ihany no nanao azy.
He helped me.	Nanampy ahy izy.
He said he would not.	Nilaza izy fa tsy hanao izany.
He drank water.	Nisotro rano izy.
That's right about you.	Marina ny momba anao.
That, friends, is a story at another time.	Izany, ry namana, dia tantara amin'ny fotoana hafa.
Not in this one.	Tsy amin'ity.
I was so scared that something was coming.	Natahotra be aho sao hisy ho avy.
That’s why you are !.	Izany no antony anao!.
More than that.	Mihoatra noho izany izany.
I was unconscious.	Tsy nahatsiaro tena aho.
It can go anywhere.	Mety handeha na aiza na aiza.
No one is there.	Tsy misy olona ao.
But no one could tell me what it was.	Saingy tsy nisy afaka nilaza tamiko hoe inona izany.
Either way, we'll see you next time.	Na izany na tsy izany, mbola hihaona amin'ny manaraka.
You are so wonderful.	Tena mahafinaritra ianao.
They might help.	Mety hanampy izy ireo.
I love these too, but I really love having both.	Tiako koa ireo, fa tena tiako ny manana azy roa.
This place is also wrong.	Diso koa io toerana io.
I don't have much work.	Tsy manana asa be aho.
I didn’t get the day.	Tsy nahazo ny andro aho.
There was no way I was sure.	Tsy nisy fomba azoko antoka.
He looks forward to the future.	Manantena ny ho avy izy.
There is no place for you here, you should know that.	Tsy misy toerana ho anao eto, tokony ho fantatrao izany.
Three years ago.	Telo taona lasa izay.
You help him.	Manampy azy ianao.
But that doesn’t have to be a bad thing.	Saingy tsy voatery ho zavatra ratsy izany.
Because he didn't want to study.	Satria tsy te hianatra izy.
There are two problems with this idea.	Misy olana roa amin'ity hevitra ity.
I tried to say it.	Niezaka nilaza izany aho.
We have work to do.	Manana asa tokony hatao isika.
I'm ready.	Efa vonona aho.
Of course, this happened to everyone, but nonetheless.	Mazava ho azy fa nitranga tamin'ny rehetra izany, saingy na izany aza.
He stays here.	Mijanona eto izy.
You are very busy.	Sahirana be ianao.
Or maybe it really is.	Na angamba tena izy tokoa.
She was able to give him a beautiful dress.	Afaka nanome azy akanjo tsara tarehy izy.
Both probably happened.	Samy nitranga angamba.
However, it is not very good in time or money.	Na izany aza, tsy dia tsara loatra amin'ny fotoana na vola izany.
I just have to believe it.	Tsy maintsy mino izany fotsiny aho.
You will be home soon.	Hody tsy ho ela ianao.
He is very busy.	Be atao be izy.
It will do the same for you.	Hanao toy izany koa ho anao izany.
They want to be great, they want to win.	Te ho lehibe izy ireo, te handresy.
They didn't seem to see us.	Toa tsy nahita anay izy ireo.
After watching the movie.	Rehefa avy nijery ny sarimihetsika.
Nothing is without space.	Tsy misy zavatra tsy misy toerana.
And that is exactly what happened.	Ary izany indrindra no nitranga.
I never saw this man again.	Tsy nahita an’io lehilahy io intsony aho.
I thought he did a great job.	Nihevitra aho fa nanao asa lehibe izy.
Maybe he knew.	Angamba fantany.
I apologize to you.	Miala tsiny aminao aho.
I worked hard.	Niasa be aho.
This is not a big question.	Tsy fanontaniana lehibe izany.
They really love him.	Tena tia azy izy ireo.
I don’t think he really liked it.	Heveriko fa tsy tena tiany ilay izy.
I had thought about everything.	Efa nieritreritra ny zava-drehetra aho.
I have seen it here, here, and here.	Efa hitako teto, teto, ary teto.
You two can play again.	Afaka milalao indray ianareo roa.
He did and saw nothing.	Nanao izy ary tsy nahita na inona na inona.
Tell us what you think !.	Lazao anay ny hevitrao!.
I want to be done.	Te ho vita aho.
A lot of people love him.	Be dia be ny olona tia azy.
So work hard.	Koa miasa mafy.
If anything, it’s more complicated.	Raha misy, dia sarotra kokoa izany.
I'm alone.	Izaho irery.
Not every day will be like that.	Tsy ny andro rehetra no ho toy izany.
No, it's not.	Tsia, tsy izany.
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Tsy te hiresaka momba izany aho.
He didn't look at her.	Tsy nijery azy izy.
I'm talking.	Miresaka aho.
And once he didn’t come back.	Ary indray mandeha izy tsy niverina.
It’s too hard to read or understand.	Sarotra loatra ny mamaky na mahazo azy.
Isn't that good.	Tsy tsara ve izany.
Works well.	Miasa tsara.
They are both very worried about it.	Samy manahy mafy ny amin’izany izy ireo.
They really should be.	Tena tokony ho izy ireo.
He hoped to go to the moon one day.	Nanantena ny handeha amin’ny volana izy indray andro any.
The door, very close but very far.	Ny varavarana, tena akaiky fa lavitra be.
It’s there now, and it’s going well.	Efa misy izy io ankehitriny, ary mandeha tsara.
This may not be the end.	Tsy mety ho izao no farany.
I know you are.	Fantatro fa ianao.
It was wrong.	Tsy nety izany.
I thought it might be hard to find me.	Nieritreritra aho hoe mety ho sarotra ny nahita ahy.
It's been a long time.	Efa ela izay.
You don’t know what they are.	Tsy fantatrao hoe inona izy ireo.
We don't even need a car to get there.	Tsy mila fiara akory izahay vao tonga any aminy.
He lived alone.	Nipetraka irery izy.
The trip was not time consuming.	Tsy nandany fotoana ny dia.
The trip took about three full days.	Telo andro eo ho eo ny dia feno.
It's not too long.	Tsy dia lava loatra izany.
Both are true.	Samy marina ny iray.
If money is not an issue,	Raha tsy olana ny vola,
It just wasn’t right for them.	Tsy nety ho azy ireo fotsiny izany.
And thank you very much.	Ary misaotra anao indrindra.
He is very similar.	Tena mitovy izy.
He didn’t even say, come on.	Tsy niteny akory izy hoe, ho avy eo.
But you didn’t think of that.	Saingy tsy nieritreritra an'izany ianao.
You can learn more about it tonight.	Afaka mianatra bebe kokoa momba izany anio hariva.
I can't see him very well.	Tsy hitako tsara izy.
Me.	Ahy.
Great work remains to be done.	Asa lehibe mbola tsy maintsy hatao.
Maybe not at all.	Angamba tsy izany mihitsy.
People have been talking about it.	Efa niresaka momba izany ny olona.
Men really aren’t there to do that.	Tena tsy eo ny lehilahy hanao izany.
You’ll never get it, so don’t worry too much about it.	Tsy ho azonao mihitsy, koa aza manahy loatra momba izany.
I always have.	Manana foana aho.
I’m sure you understand why.	Azoko antoka fa azonao ny antony.
I told them to be sure.	Nolazaiko azy ireo mba ho azo antoka.
But no, that's wrong.	Saingy tsia, diso izany.
He knew what he got.	Fantany izay azony.
Top notch.	Tsara indrindra.
It is for us.	Ho antsika tokoa izany.
The room is not big.	Tsy dia lehibe ny efitrano.
Or maybe the wrong question.	Na mety diso fanontaniana.
He was able to walk.	Afaka nandeha izy.
That is, everything as quickly as possible.	Izany hoe, haingana araka izay azo atao ny zava-drehetra.
We are having a great time.	Manana fotoana mahafinaritra isika.

Water is everywhere.	Eny rehetra eny ny rano.
This is very good news.	Tena vaovao tsara izany.
I understand, I understand.	azoko, azoko.
And you do.	Ary manao izany ianao.
It must be a mistake.	Tsy maintsy ho fahadisoana izany.
You may not have one.	Mety tsy manana na dia iray aza.
And it’s not real at the same time.	Ary tsy tena izy amin'ny fotoana iray ihany.
You have to see it.	Tsy maintsy mahita izany ianao.
Someone was watching them.	Nisy nijery azy ireo.
I'm worried about going home.	Manahy ny hody aho.
I love doing it, actually.	Tiako ny manao izany, raha ny marina.
So clear on.	Ka mazava amin'ny.
But I am different.	Saingy hafa aho.
Nothing is right, and nothing is enough.	Tsy misy na inona na inona mety, ary na inona na inona dia ampy.
Tell the truth that you are very good like him.	Lazao ny marina fa tena mahay toa azy ianao.
He was as fun as ever.	Nahafinaritra toy ny taloha izy.
It was not like at home.	Tsy toy ny tao an-trano izany.
Don't worry about me now.	Aza manahy ahy izao.
That’s where it started.	Teo no nanomboka.
That's what happened.	Izany no nitranga.
No one is barren.	Tsy misy olona momba.
If you said that before, it would be better.	Raha nilaza izany ianao taloha dia ho tsara kokoa.
What happened in the past is gone.	Ny zava-nitranga taloha dia efa lasa.
John arrived late for the meeting.	Tara vao tonga tany amin’ilay fivoriana i John.
This is the real thing.	Izany no tena izy.
This is where we are.	Ity no toerana misy antsika.
And then, there was the faster.	Ary avy eo, nisy ny haingana kokoa.
Just say you like it.	Lazao fotsiny fa tianao izany.
Did the man just call?	Vao avy niantso ve ilay lehilahy?
Someone came.	Nisy olona tonga.
You have to see it to believe it.	Tsy maintsy mahita izany ianao vao mino izany.
Nice people too.	Olona mahafinaritra koa.
I think he was fun.	Heveriko fa nahafinaritra izy.
We have the money to do that.	Manana vola hanaovana izany izahay.
The question is what will happen next.	Ny fanontaniana dia hoe inona no hitranga manaraka.
I believe they love me.	Mino aho fa tia ahy izy ireo.
I suspect that’s his heart.	Miahiahy aho fa izany no fony.
There is still a chance for you.	Mbola misy fahafahana ho anao.
I don't see that to be true.	Tsy hitako hoe marina izany.
Others say no.	Ny hafa indray milaza hoe tsia.
They talked about it.	Niresaka momba izany izy ireo.
The place is very similar to the picture.	Ny toerana tena mitovy amin'ny sary.
Too good.	Mety loatra.
He didn’t finish breakfast.	Tsy nahavita ny sakafo maraina izy.
It's raining now.	Efa lasa ny orana amin'izao fotoana izao.

Got bad news.	Nahazo vaovao ratsy.
Don’t try to be something you are not.	Aza miezaka ny ho zavatra tsy ianao.
There are many such places.	Misy toerana maro toy izany.
He stopped.	Nijanona izy.
You have no job.	Tsy manana asa ianao.
Really, really fast.	Tena, tena haingana.
Of course, there were other ways.	Mazava ho azy fa nisy fomba hafa.
It went hard, no matter what, and it went fast.	Nandeha mafy ilay izy, na inona na inona, ary nandeha haingana.
Going but not properly.	Mandeha nefa tsy araka ny tokony ho izy.
Never thought of that.	Tsy nieritreritra an'io mihitsy.
he wondered.	nanontany tena izy.
They returned in the evening.	Niverina izy ireo ny hariva.
And he died.	Ary maty izy.
If male.	Raha lehilahy.
And it goes well.	Ary mandeha tsara.

It really came to him.	Tena tonga taminy izany.
And the most appropriate.	Ary ny tena mety.

We spent the night there.	Nandany ny alina tany izahay.
Don't go home until you're ready.	Aza mody raha tsy efa vonona.
I said he could go.	Nilaza aho fa afaka mandeha izy.

Why is that?	Nahoana no toy izany?
For a long time.	Mandritra ny fotoana ela.
But he is not.	Fa tsy izy.
For thou art a wise man;	Fa ianao dia lehilahy mahay;
But, it’s not really that.	Saingy, tsy izany tokoa.

I know what he wants.	Fantatro izay tiany.
Three children lived in the house.	Ankizy telo no nipetraka tao an-trano.
I never wanted to come.	Tsy naniry ny ho tonga mihitsy aho.
We are wrong.	Tsy mety izahay.
He did not have a private car.	Tsy nanana fiara manokana izy.
To be sure, it is easier said than done.	Ny azo antoka dia mora kokoa ny milaza izany noho ny atao.

It’s not too bad.	Tsy dia ratsy loatra izany.
They bought a new house.	Nividy trano vaovao izy ireo.
If you like it, fine.	Raha tianao dia tsara.
No, worse than that.	Tsia, ratsy noho izany.
Just a minute.	Iray minitra fotsiny.
I don’t understand why it didn’t happen.	Tsy azoko hoe nahoana no tsy nisy izany.
But there you are.	Fa eo ianao.
I had to call.	Tsy maintsy niantso aho.
But there was no time for that.	Saingy tsy nisy fotoana ho an'izany.
I have to talk to him.	Tsy maintsy miresaka aminy aho.
He didn’t look far but decided to do his own thing.	Tsy nijery lavitra izy fa nanapa-kevitra ny hanao ny azy.
He was the real man for the job.	Izy no tena olona ho an'ny asa.
Everything goes and works that way.	Ny zava-drehetra dia mandeha sy miasa toy izany.
He will stay eventually.	Hijanona izy amin'ny farany.
But the truth is everywhere and everything.	Fa ny marina dia eny rehetra eny ary ny zava-drehetra.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
The idea is the same.	Mitovy ihany ilay hevitra.
Thanks for the opportunity.	Misaotra tamin'ny fahafahana.
But something has to happen.	Saingy misy zavatra tsy maintsy hitranga.
And no, it doesn’t go the other way.	Ary tsia, tsy mandeha amin'ny fomba hafa izany.
Like this special day.	Toy ity andro manokana ity.
The past is dead.	Maty ny lasa.
Thought to do the same thing.	Nieritreritra ny hanao zavatra mitovy ihany.
They always looked at me too.	Nijery ahy foana koa izy ireo.
Not very fun.	Tsy dia mahafinaritra.
We now have enough money for the trip.	Manana vola ampy ho an'ny dia izahay izao.
I love dogs.	Tiako ny alika.
I remember the good old days.	Tadidiko ny andro tsara taloha.
I think everyone knows that.	Heveriko fa fantatry ny rehetra izany.
One doesn’t really need it.	Tsy tena mila izany ny iray.
I really enjoyed reading it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy ny namaky izany.
He left and never came back.	Nandeha izy ary tsy niverina intsony.
He then said the moon was wrong.	Nilaza izy avy eo fa diso ny volana.
We must help the sick.	Tsy maintsy manampy ny marary isika.
News and news go faster.	Mandeha haingana kokoa ny vaovao sy vaovao.
Don’t buy it.	Aza mividy izany.
Everything else can stay the same.	Ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia afaka mijanona ho toy izany koa.
But that’s a good thing.	Saingy zavatra tsara izany.
And he never understood.	Ary tsy azony mihitsy.
He no longer wrote.	Tsy nanoratra intsony izy.
There is still much to be done.	Mbola betsaka ny tokony hatao.
I study it again.	Mianatra azy indray aho.
If they are good.	Raha izy ireo dia tsara.
But you will be fine.	Fa ho tsara ianao.
I didn't see anything.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona aho.
You will be very happy together.	Ho faly tokoa ianareo miaraka.
We didn’t talk much.	Tsy dia niresaka firy izahay.
He was not in the right place.	Tsy teo amin'ny toerana tokony hisy azy izy.
I find that I do the same.	Hitako fa manao toy izany koa aho.
He just wanted to talk.	Te hiresaka fotsiny izy.
He may be there now.	Efa eo angamba izy izao.
If anyone reads and understands.	Raha misy mamaky sy mahazo.
He shouldn’t have slept.	Tsy tokony ho natory izy.
He looked at her again.	Nijery azy indray izy.
Maybe he can help them too?	Angamba afaka manampy azy ireo koa izy?
He may be wrong.	Mety ho diso hevitra izy.
The proximity is good.	Ny toerana akaiky dia tsara.
It will be a long night.	Ho lava alina ny andro.
He is a handsome man.	Lehilahy tsara tarehy izy.
I do what he never did.	Izay tsy nataony mihitsy no ataoko.
No one liked him.	Tsy nisy tia azy.
Today, that is.	Androany, izany hoe.
The night has come.	Tonga ny alina.
Surely children today are more troubled than we are.	Azo antoka fa sahirana kokoa noho isika ny ankizy ankehitriny.
I tried to be.	Niezaka ny ho aho.
The fact that it is not as bad as it really is.	Ny hoe tsy ratsy araka ny tena izy ilay izy.
Not very good.	Tsy dia tsara.
He is currently in an unknown location.	Any amin’ny toerana tsy fantatra kosa izy amin’izao fotoana izao.
They didn’t see me when they tried.	Tsy nahita ahy izy ireo raha nanandrana.
Whatever it is.	Na inona na inona izany.
I am your teacher.	Izaho no mpampianatra anao.
I need to do it for myself.	Mila manao izany ho ahy aho.
That might be good.	Mety ho tsara izany.
I could have done it without it.	Afaka nanao izany aho raha tsy nisy izany.
What a problem there is no.	Inona no olana tsy misy.
And they do.	Ary manao izany izy ireo.
So we will do something very important.	Ka hanao zavatra tena lehibe isika.
It was a little fun today.	Nahafinaritra kely androany.
Not a lot of money, but at the time.	Tsy dia be ny vola, fa tamin’izany.
Everything is because you want them there.	Ny zava-drehetra dia satria tianao any izy ireo.
Not everyone is willing to work hard.	Tsy ny rehetra no vonona ny hanao asa mafy.
Don’t let that get away from you.	Aza avela hiala aminao izany.
However, it is not pretty.	Na izany aza, tsy tsara tarehy.
It may not be safe.	Mety tsy azo antoka izany.
It didn’t happen and it couldn’t.	Tsy nitranga izany ary tsy afaka.
There is so much more to do.	Be dia be ny zavatra hafa tokony hatao.
We have all done a good job.	Efa nanao asa tsara daholo isika rehetra.
It was not easy for him.	Tsy mora taminy izany.
This did not happen immediately.	Tsy tonga dia nitranga izany.
I don’t even know what it is.	Tsy fantatro akory hoe inona izany.
He doesn't like her.	Tsy tiany izy.
I haven’t had a major yet.	Mbola tsy nanana lehibe aho.
So it will be faster.	Noho izany dia ho haingana kokoa.
I think that’s the idea anyway.	Heveriko fa izany no hevitra na ahoana na ahoana.
Then he came back again.	Dia niverina indray izy.
But we didn’t find one.	Saingy tsy nahita iray izahay.
One day he died.	Indray andro dia maty izy.
Did they.	Nanao ve izy ireo.
I will never see him again.	Tsy hihaona aminy intsony aho.
Maybe you should.	Angamba ianao tokony.
And kids need it more.	Ary mila izany bebe kokoa ny ankizy.
I’ve said that before.	Efa nolazaiko teo aloha izany.
We had to study hard.	Nila nianatra mafy izahay.
He went to his room.	Nankany amin’ny efitranony izy.
If so, we will stay there for the day.	Raha izany no izy, dia hijanona ao mandritra ny andro izahay.
Maybe they will know.	Angamba ho fantany.
I was a child then.	Mbola zaza aho tamin’izany.
Now, he knows.	Ankehitriny, fantany.
I don’t care about people like that if you do everything for them.	Tsy miraharaha ny olona toy izany raha manao ny zava-drehetra ho azy ianao.
If the weather is really bad, stay indoors.	Raha tena ratsy ny andro dia mijanona ao an-trano.
He came to see us when he decided to make the film.	Tonga nijery anay izy rehefa nanapa-kevitra ny hanao ilay sarimihetsika.
It didn’t help.	Tsy nanampy izany.
And he saw him.	Dia nahita azy izy.
Unless both are going to be out of luck.	Raha tsy hoe samy tsy ho tsara vintana.
This is not a good thing.	Tsy zavatra tsara izany.
Maybe yes, maybe no.	Angamba eny, angamba tsia.
I want to get out of here.	Te hiala eto aho.
Just stay there and do nothing.	Mijanona eo fotsiny ary tsy manao na inona na inona.
He told her to stop.	Niteny mafy taminy izy mba hijanona.
Never say dead.	Aza miteny hoe maty mihitsy.
Without it, we will not survive.	Raha tsy misy izany dia tsy ho velona isika.
I'm not sure what's wrong with you.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe inona no tsy mety aminao.
The day did not go well.	Tsy nandeha tsara ny andro.
In fact, there was a good chance he didn’t come back.	Raha ny marina dia nisy vintana tsara fa tsy niverina izy.
No, he had to stop.	Tsia, tsy maintsy nijanona izy.
He never told me that.	Tsy nilaza izany tamiko mihitsy izy.
I just had friends.	Nanana namana fotsiny aho.
It came again as if nothing had happened.	Tonga indray toy ny tsy nisy nitranga.
He lost his luck.	Very vintana izy.
They’re not just about where they are.	Tsy momba ny toerana misy azy fotsiny izy ireo.
The same is true of many others.	Toy izany koa ny maro hafa.
He knew he couldn't wait any longer.	Fantany fa tsy afaka miandry intsony izy.
Yes, it is.	Eny, toy izany.
You are.	Ianao dia.
So, really fun.	Noho izany, tena mahafinaritra.
I love this moment.	Tiako ity fotoana ity.
Of course we are.	Mazava ho azy fa isika.
He bought one and I bought one.	Nividy iray izy ary nividy iray aho.
He paused for a minute and thought.	Nijanona iray minitra izy ary nieritreritra.
Easy and fast to get.	Mora sy haingana azo.
With nice clothes and everything else.	Miaraka amin'ny akanjo mahafinaritra sy ny zavatra hafa rehetra.
So is he.	Toy izany koa izy.
I’m not sure what to do with the players right now.	Tsy fantatro tsara izay tokony hatao amin'ny mpilalao ankehitriny.
They are very good cars.	Fiara tena tsara izy ireo.
You say no to others.	Milaza ianao fa tsy ny hafa.
I don’t want to be there anymore.	Tsy te hisy intsony aho.
Or something like that, though.	Na zavatra toy izany, na izany aza.
Both said they had no problems.	Samy nilaza fa tsy nanana olana.
Many patients died.	Betsaka ny marary maty.
But if he does, I might understand better now.	Fa raha manao izany izy dia mety ho azony kokoa izao aho.
You will never get another opportunity like this.	Tsy hahazo fahafahana hafa tahaka izao mihitsy ianao.
I don’t see them anymore, or maybe in a few years.	Tsy mahita azy ireo intsony aho, na mety afaka taona vitsivitsy.
It has already happened.	Efa nitranga izany.
It's been too long.	Efa ela loatra izany.
I didn’t see anything about it.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona momba izany aho.
I had to write a difficult letter.	Tsy maintsy nanoratra taratasy sarotra aho.
She is happy	Faly izy
So, it’s not really necessary.	Noho izany, tsy tena ilaina izany.
Then he left.	Dia lasa izy.
We drink more water	Misotro rano bebe kokoa izahay
He heard nothing.	Tsy nandre na inona na inona izy.
I don’t like it at all.	Tsy tiako mihitsy izany.
We didn’t have it at all.	Tsy nanana tanteraka izahay.
I knew he was going to do great things.	Fantatro fa hanao zavatra lehibe izy.
I had it.	Nanana izany aho.
It’s all still new.	Mbola vaovao daholo izany.
All, all of me.	Rehetra, ahy rehetra.
I got this, this morning.	Azoko ity, androany maraina.
At worst, minutes.	Amin'ny ratsy indrindra, minitra.
They are first year.	Taona voalohany izy ireo.
How is that?	Ahoana izany?
I don't live there.	Tsy mipetraka any aho.
It only took a month.	Iray volana ihany no nahazo azy.
You are not like everyone else.	Tsy toy ny hafa ianao.
It's been two months.	Efa roa volana izao.
It’s always at the end of the day.	Amin'ny faran'ny andro foana izany.
I’m really good, actually.	Tena tsara aho, raha ny marina.
The other is.	Ny iray hafa dia.
For patients, this is good news.	Ho an'ny marary dia vaovao tsara izany.
The only question is how did it happen?	Ny hany fanontaniana dia hoe ahoana no nahatonga izany?
Only the first two are the smallest.	Ny roa voalohany ihany no kely indrindra.
He said that could not be true.	Nilaza izy fa tsy mety ho marina izany.
I work really hard.	Tena miasa mafy aho.
I decided not to hear it.	Nanapa-kevitra ny tsy nandre izany aho.
People are buying more things than ever before.	Mividy zavatra betsaka kokoa noho ny taloha ny olona ankehitriny.
There was no question about it, of course.	Tsy nisy fanontaniana mihitsy momba izany, mazava ho azy.
This is not his favorite room.	Tsy efitrano tiany indrindra io.
It's a house.	Trano io.
Just a bad day.	Indray andro ratsy fotsiny.
There are too many old stories.	Be loatra ny tantara taloha.
It will be easier in many ways.	Ho mora kokoa izany amin'ny fomba maro.
The other two sat down.	Nipetraka ny roa hafa.
They are yours.	Anao izy ireo.
Too much time has passed.	Be loatra ny fotoana lasa.
We will see something like this.	Hahita zavatra toy izao isika.
In fact, you might be able to help as well.	Raha ny marina, mety afaka manampy koa ianao.
We got you.	Nahazo anao izahay.
People know us.	Fantatry ny olona isika.
It also comes in small.	Izy io koa dia tonga amin'ny kely.
He didn't need to ask.	Tsy nila nanontany izy.
He can't be wrong.	Tsy afaka ny ho diso izy.
He will not be happy when he finds out.	Tsy ho faly izy rehefa fantany.
There was nothing.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona.
However, it was not as good as it really was.	Na izany aza, dia tsy tsara toy ny tena nisy teo.
As for that, it’s still not.	Raha ny momba izany dia mbola tsy izany.
You never get it.	Tsy azonao mihitsy.
That is, if he needs help.	Izany hoe raha mila fanampiana izy.
I don't know what to do here again.	Tsy azoko hoe inona indray no hatao eto.
It didn’t go in.	Tsy niditra izany.
He was just like everyone else.	Toy ny olona hafa izy.
He was still out there.	Mbola tany ivelany izy.
Could this be ?.	Mety ho ity ve?.
Maybe he saw, maybe he didn’t.	Angamba izy nahita, angamba tsy nahita.
He will watch.	Hijery izy.
I don’t like the word at all.	Tsy tiako mihitsy ilay teny.
He often intended to get out.	Matetika izy no nikasa hivoaka.
It shouldn’t be.	Tsy tokony ho izy.
Needless to say, he left immediately.	Tsy ilaina ny milaza fa niala avy hatrany izy.
I don't want to stay here.	Tsy te hijanona eto aho.
They expect your opinion.	Manantena ny hevitrao izy ireo.
Yes, you are alone now.	Eny, irery ianareo izao.
He made a mistake.	Nanao fahadisoana izy.
.	.
Of course, for their own.	Mazava ho azy, ho an'ny azy avy.
Will do it today.	Dia hanao izany anio.
If you go between those two, that’s for sure.	Raha mandeha amin'ireo roa ireo ianao dia tena izany.
He almost called her again.	Saika niantso azy indray izy.
It is not difficult.	Tsy sarotra izany.
But that’s another story.	Saingy tantara hafa izany.
There was nothing, for a long time.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona, nandritra ny fotoana ela.
They were always buying new things.	Nividy zavatra vaovao foana izy ireo.
The two work as one.	Miasa ho iray izy roa.
We did a lot of work.	Nanao asa be dia be izahay.
I really tried to think about it.	Tena niezaka nieritreritra an’izany aho.
Not one person either.	Tsy olona iray ihany koa.
Everyone here knows that.	Fantatry ny rehetra eto izany.
He has already said the word.	Efa nilaza ny teny izy.
He walks.	Mandeha izy.
You have time.	Manana fotoana ianao.
But there was no place far from the house.	Saingy tsy nisy toerana lavitra ny trano.
Don’t tell anyone about the accident.	Aza milaza na iza na iza momba ny loza.
You need help.	Mila fanampiana ianao.
You have everything to lose.	Manana ny zavatra rehetra ho very ianao.
Today is the year!	Androany no tonga taona!
Time is mine.	Ahy ny fotoana.
I thought a lot.	Nieritreritra be aho.
Maybe, or, most importantly.	Angamba, na, indrindra indrindra.
They are not the problem.	Tsy izy ireo no olana.
There is no reason for that.	Tsy misy antony izany.
Thank you for helping.	Misaotra anao nanampy.
He heard something outside.	Nandre zavatra teny ivelany izy.
Otherwise, you won’t do it.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy hanao izany ianao.
He is sick.	Izy no marary.
Everyone is a human being.	Ny olona rehetra dia samy olona.
That seems a long way off.	Toa lavitra be izany.
You don’t need anything else.	Tsy mila zavatra hafa ianao.
I am alone here.	Izaho irery eto.
Little children,.	Ry zaza kely,.
It shouldn’t have played like that.	Tsy tokony ho nilalao toy izany.
But for now, that’s not bad.	Saingy amin'izao fotoana izao dia tsy ratsy izany.
So this is how it started.	Ka izao no nanomboka.
I've seen this before.	Efa nahita an'io aho taloha.
And he was angry.	Dia tezitra izy.
It’s summer time!	Fotoana fahavaratra izao!
It's like this.	Toy izao izany.
Why don't you.	Nahoana ianao no tsy manao.
That might be good.	Mety ho tsara izany.
I can't tell you anything else.	Tsy afaka milaza zavatra hafa aminao aho.
He was a great man.	Lehilahy lehibe izy.
I think it helped a lot.	Heveriko fa nanampy betsaka izany.
The water came out.	Nivoaka ny rano.
Anyone could watch from there.	Na iza na iza afaka nijery avy tao.
You must read this book.	Tsy maintsy mamaky ity boky ity ianao.
There is nothing.	Tsy misy na inona na inona.
Both are women.	Samy vehivavy.
You are the same as before.	Toy ny taloha ianao.
He doesn't understand it.	Tsy azony izany.
I'm really free.	Tena afaka aho.
I know they do.	Fantatro fa manao izany izy ireo.
It’s a real story.	Tena tantara izany.
You are very strong.	Tena mahery ianao.
I like things in particular.	Tiako ny zavatra manokana.
And I did.	Ary nataoko izany.
He doesn't even know yet.	Mbola tsy fantany akory.
I really go for it.	Tena mandeha amin'izany aho.
It's been a long time coming.	Efa ela no lasa toy izany.
You are a domestic person.	Olona an-trano ianao.
Maybe there is another reason.	Angamba misy antony hafa.
But that's the way it goes.	Fa izany no mandeha.
It is.	Izy io.
That's what happened.	Izany no nitranga.
You really like them with summer songs.	Tena tianao amin'ny hira fahavaratra izy ireo.
We will leave before the first light tomorrow.	Hiala alohan'ny mazava voalohany isika rahampitso.
This is very important.	Tena ilaina izany.
The future is uncertain.	Tsy azo antoka ny ho avy.
They were all beautiful, all the time.	Izy rehetra dia tsara tarehy, tamin'ny fotoana rehetra.
It just exists.	Misy fotsiny izany.
It may not be good for him.	Mety tsy ho tsara ho azy izany.
I can too.	Afaka ataoko koa.
They found a way.	Nahita fomba izy ireo.
He doesn't like me.	Tsy tiany aho.
Thank you for giving me and others like me the opportunity.	Misaotra nanome ahy sy ny hafa toa ahy ny fahafahana.
I should never have brought him here.	Tsy tokony ho nitondra azy teto mihitsy aho.
It's easy.	Mora izany.
Thirty minutes ago.	Telopolo minitra lasa.
However, here you are now.	Na izany aza, eto ianao izao.
I'm crazy.	Izaho dia adala.
Only one is different.	Iray ihany no hafa.
It was hard to see much outside.	Sarotra ny nahita betsaka tany ivelany.
I never had that.	Tsy mba nanana izany mihitsy aho.
He loves them.	Tia azy ireo izy.
No, that is not enough.	Tsia, tsy ampy izany.
It’s not real.	Tsy tena izy io.
I know they won’t.	Fantatro fa tsy hanao izany izy ireo.
I will definitely do it again.	Tena hanao izany indray aho.
He never asked her.	Tsy nanontany azy mihitsy izy.
They may fall asleep or read a book.	Mety ho renoky ny torimaso izy ireo na mamaky boky.
We had time.	Nahazo fotoana izahay.
At the right time.	Amin'ny fotoana mety.
The better the bigger you get.	Ny tsara kokoa dia ny lehibe kokoa azonao.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy.
Maybe not the time or the place.	Angamba tsy ny fotoana na ny toerana.
He didn't think either.	Tsy nieritreritra koa izy.
This is how it should be done.	Toy izao no tokony hatao.
I know you have.	Fantatro fa manana ianao.
He really should be like that.	Tokony ho toy izany tokoa izy.
And then again the next night.	Ary avy eo indray ny alina manaraka.
We were out for a week.	Tany ivelany nandritra ny herinandro izahay.
It could be the same here.	Mety ho toy izany koa ny eto.
There is no way.	Tsy misy fomba.
You have to believe me.	Tsy maintsy mino ahy ianao.
It’s just work old fools.	Asa fotsiny io ry adala taloha.
She looks sick.	Toa marary izy.
For you, this book is a must have.	Ho anao, ity boky ity dia tsy maintsy ilaina.
The question is, why and why now ?.	Ny fanontaniana dia hoe, nahoana ary nahoana izao?.
It’s a wonderful place.	Toerana mahafinaritra izany.
I decided not to.	Nanapa-kevitra aho fa tsy.
He felt awkward	Nahatsiaro ho sahirana izy
Because he knew.	Satria fantany.
It does nothing.	Tsy manao na inona na inona izany.
It takes a long time.	Mandeha ela izy io.
I think that kid came to his own.	Heveriko fa tonga amin'ny azy io zaza io.
Necessary work may remain.	Mety hijanona ny asa ilaina.
And we are waiting.	Ary miandry izahay.
It’s like he has it.	Toy ny hoe manana azy izy.
I was already feeling good.	Efa nahatsiaro tsara aho.
We had fun.	Nahafinaritra izahay.
It is no longer a place for women and children.	Tsy toerana ho an'ny vehivavy sy ny ankizy intsony io.
Please, no.	Azafady, tsia.
He may die.	Mety maty izy.
Whatever they are.	Na inona na inona izy ireo.
Can we drive?	Afaka mandeha fiara ve isika?
And we had a really good time.	Ary nanana fotoana tena tsara izahay.
Thank you very much thank you.	Misaotra betsaka misaotra.
But he was too late.	Saingy tara loatra izy.
That’s a lot.	Betsaka izany.
We thought there was a future for us.	Nihevitra izahay fa hisy ho avy ho anay.
I've seen it.	Efa hitako izany.
This is obvious.	Mazava aloha izany.
He can no longer walk alone.	Tsy afaka mandeha irery intsony izy.
It’s fun to help people.	Mahafinaritra ny manampy olona.
It was also a sleepless night.	Izany koa dia alina tsy nisy torimaso.
This is already clear.	Efa mazava izany.
It will do a real job.	Hanao asa tena izy.
I'm still waiting to see him.	Mbola miandry ny hahita azy aho.
It is very safe and beautiful.	Tena azo antoka sy tsara tarehy ilay izy.
He really knows me.	Tena mahafantatra ahy izy.
He doesn't want to look at them now.	Tsy te hijery azy ireo izy izao.
It came naturally again.	Tonga ho azy indray izany.
Isn't that true.	Tsy izany ve no marina.
No one sees here.	Tsy misy mahita eto.
We got out very quickly.	Nivoaka haingana be izahay.
There is a lot to do.	Betsaka ny zavatra tsy maintsy atao.
I want to do what is right.	Te hanao ny tsara aho.
He will be back.	Mbola hiverina izy.
It doesn't work.	Tsy mandeha izany.
But here, there was something.	Fa eto, nisy zavatra.
He was very scared.	Tena natahotra izy.
It didn’t help.	Tsy nanampy izany.
It’s fun to play together.	Mahafinaritra ny milalao miaraka.
I don’t remember eating anything.	Tsy tadidiko nihinana na inona na inona.
Whatever it is.	Na inona na inona izany.
I have no idea how to do this.	Tsy manana hevitra ny fomba hanaovana an'io aho.
And one day he does.	Ary indray andro dia manao izany izy.
Then there is another child.	Avy eo dia misy ankizy iray hafa.
Letters, letters, letters.	Taratasy, taratasy, taratasy.
So you are in good luck now.	Koa manana vintana tsara ianao izao.
I hope they win.	Manantena aho fa handresy izy ireo.
No one wants to be wrong about what happens next.	Tsy nisy te ho diso ny zavatra hitranga manaraka.
Without it, nothing will happen.	Raha tsy misy izany dia tsy hisy zavatra hitranga.
He spent hours talking to me about it.	Nandany ora maro niresaka tamiko momba izany.
You probably know that.	Fantatrao angamba izany.
He knows what to do.	Fantany izay tokony hatao.
They may be able to help us.	Mety hahazo fanampiana ho antsika izy ireo.
There are no other words about it.	Tsy misy teny hafa momba izany.
We met last night in this room.	Nihaona izahay omaly hariva teto amin'ity efitrano ity.
He just goes for it.	Lasa ho azy fotsiny izy.
One afternoon he stopped.	Indray tolakandro dia nijanona izy.
No one was waiting for us there.	Tsy nisy niandry anay tao.
They become a kind of money.	Lasa karazana vola izy ireo.
There is no such thing.	Tsy misy toy izany.
I vividly remember those years.	Tadidiko tsara ireo taona ireo.
The girl did the same.	Toy izany koa ilay tovovavy.
They may be accustomed.	Mety ho zatra izy ireo.
I wonder where it came from.	Heveriko fa avy aiza ilay izy.
She just had to wait for him to get there.	Tsy maintsy niandry azy ho tonga tany fotsiny izy.
I hope that’s not true about that.	Manantena aho fa tsy marina ny momba izany.
The man thought.	Nieritreritra ilay lehilahy.
One man died.	Lehilahy iray no maty.
We thought it was okay.	Nihevitra izahay fa tsy maninona.
I should never have started drinking.	Tsy tokony ho nanomboka nisotro mihitsy.
To my surprise, it was still early in the morning.	Gaga aho fa mbola vao maraina be.
When something goes, that’s it.	Rehefa misy zavatra mandeha, dia izay.
This road has gone farther than the end.	Nandeha lavitra noho ny farany io lalana io.
We haven't seen them in about a month.	Efa iray volana teo ho eo izahay no tsy nahita azy ireo.
Is he.	Izy ve.
I’m not talking about him.	Tsy miresaka momba azy aho.
Right now that.	Amin'izao fotoana izao fa.
It says something.	Miteny zavatra izany.
But it will not happen.	Saingy tsy hitranga izany.
It is clear to me now.	Mazava izao amiko.
Children are not allowed to go anywhere	Tsy mahazo mandeha na aiza na aiza ny ankizy
There seems to be something else in the story.	Toa tsy maintsy misy zavatra hafa ao amin'ilay tantara.
But only a little.	Saingy kely fotsiny.
He was telling the truth.	Nilaza ny marina izy.
That’s looking at him.	Izany dia mijery azy.
Are there any ?.	Misy ve ireo?.
Not just people like me.	Tsy ny olona toa ahy ihany.
I waited a while.	Niandry kely aho.
We have already bought it.	Efa nividy izany izahay.
And that is still true today.	Ary mbola marina izany ankehitriny.
I don't get anything.	Tsy mahazo na inona na inona aho.
He entered the room to take a closer look.	Niditra tao amin’ilay efitrano izy mba hijery akaiky kokoa.
He seemed happy with something.	Toa faly tamin'ny zavatra iray izy.
That is the first idea.	Izany no hevitra voalohany.
Someone was watching.	Nisy nijery.
I spoke well to him.	Niresaka tsara taminy aho.
There were people in the house.	Nisy olona tao an-trano.
And that’s a big thing.	Ary zavatra lehibe izany.
No, it certainly is.	Tsia, azo antoka fa izy io.
I '.	I'.
And it will happen often.	Ary hitranga matetika izany.
He doesn't understand.	Tsy azony.
I like it now.	Tiako izao.
He may have done so.	Mety ho nanao izany izy.
I am so happy to say that we are now.	Tena faly aho milaza fa izao isika.
I don't drink very often.	Tsy misotro matetika aho.
It belongs to everyone and nothing, nothing.	An'ny rehetra ary tsy misy, na inona na inona.
If we did, the three of us would have called sick.	Raha nanao izany izahay, dia ho niantso narary izahay telo.
There may be ways to do this as well.	Mety hisy fomba hanaovana izany koa.
And no one knows why.	Ary tsy misy mahalala ny antony.
It was a lot of work not to see anything either.	Asa be ny tsy nahita na inona na inona koa.
Men know they know.	Fantatry ny lehilahy fa fantany.
The ground was beautiful.	Nahafinaritra ny tany.
He was very skilled.	Tena nahay izy.
And he eats.	Ary mihinana izy.
The food never works.	Tsy miasa mihitsy ny sakafo.
You never stole yours.	Tsy nangalatra ny anao mihitsy ianao.
That was a must have.	Izany no tsy maintsy nisy.
I'm scared.	Matahotra ahy.
It’s just a fun story.	Tantara mahafinaritra fotsiny io.
In a natural way we are.	Amin'ny fomba mandeha ho azy isika.
She loves books and has a book about everything in her room.	Tia boky izy ary manana boky momba ny zava-drehetra ao amin'ny efitranony.
I don’t remember much, actually.	Tsy tadidiko firy, raha ny marina.
One time it was too late for the man to return.	Indray mandeha dia tara loatra ilay lehilahy niverina.
I'm sure of that.	Azoko antoka izany.
And if not, he must be dead.	Ary raha tsy izany dia tsy maintsy efa maty izy.
I haven't been out yet.	Mbola tsy nivoaka aho.
So, we.	Noho izany, isika.
I have to remember.	Tsy maintsy tadidiko.
But he couldn’t have spent time like this.	Saingy tsy afaka nandany fotoana tahaka izao izy.
You consider their likes and dislikes.	Heverinao ny tiany sy tsy tiany.
In fact, you are good.	Raha ny marina, tsara ianao.
Or maybe it’s you.	Na angamba ianao io.
Sorry to wait for you.	Miala tsiny fa miandry anao.
You know these are real women.	Fantatrao fa tena vehivavy ireo.
I love everyone.	Tiako ny olona rehetra.
No sorry, nothing.	Tsia miala tsiny, tsy misy na inona na inona.
Even then it was crazy fast.	Na dia tamin'izany aza dia adala haingana.
I didn’t want to stay home.	Tsy te hijanona tao an-trano aho.
They are both true.	Samy marina izy ireo.
I disagree.	Tsy mitovy hevitra aho.
Maybe he was thinking about it.	Angamba efa nieritreritra an’izany izy.
I love the man.	Tiako ilay lehilahy.
He is in the most difficult position right now.	Ao anatin'ny toerana sarotra indrindra izy amin'izao fotoana izao.
he is the same age as me.	mitovy taona amiko izy.
The no is no.	Ny tsia dia tsia.
He speaks the word.	Izy no miteny ny teny.
Of course, this is crazy.	Mazava ho azy fa adala izany.
I'm really bad.	Tena ratsy be aho.
It seems so.	Toa izany.
That’s a big thing.	Zavatra lehibe izany.
I'm not the girl.	Tsy izaho ilay tovovavy.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Naniry ny hiaraka taminy izy anio alina.
They tried to do that for two or three years.	Nanandrana nanao izany izy ireo nandritra ny roa na telo taona.
After that, it could be one of three paths.	Rehefa afaka izany, dia mety ho iray amin'ireo lalana telo.
In fact, not close.	Raha ny marina, tsy akaiky.
He makes good friends.	Manao namana tsara izy.
One really needs it.	Tena mila izany ny iray.
Something has to be done.	Misy zavatra tsy maintsy atao.
But it is.	Nefa izany dia .
It happened one day.	Nitranga izany indray andro.
He never told us that!	Tsy nilaza izany taminay mihitsy izy!
You don’t have to go.	Tsy mila mandeha ianao.
They will do it, they know.	Hanao izany izy ireo, fantany.
And we should leave immediately.	Ary tokony hiala avy hatrany isika.
You don’t even know what happened at first.	Tsy fantatrao akory ny zava-nitranga tamin'ny voalohany.
She wants to meet him.	Te hihaona aminy izy.
They never returned.	Tsy niverina intsony izy ireo.
I have to think about it.	Tsy maintsy mieritreritra an'izany aho.
You can watch them die and die again.	Afaka mijery azy ireo maty sy maty indray ianao.
I know he's not.	Fantatro fa tsy izy.
Where he was.	Aiza no nisy azy.
Then they always left.	Dia lasa foana izy ireo.
They went to him but did not say a word.	Nandeha teny aminy izy ireo, nefa tsy niteny.
I think a lot of people do that.	Heveriko fa maro ny olona manao toy izany.
But if they do, it will be fine.	Fa raha manao izany izy ireo dia ho tsara izany.
I really thank you so much for that.	Tena misaotra betsaka aho noho izany.
I have a chance for him.	Manana fahafahana ho azy aho.
They are so beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy izy ireo.
So far it has gone well.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia nandeha tsara.
That’s what could happen.	Izany no mety hitranga.
But you didn’t write.	Saingy tsy nanoratra ianao.
I don’t know that you can do that.	Tsy fantatro fa afaka manao izany ianao.
But you are wrong.	Fa diso ianao.
Which is true.	Izay marina.
There is nothing wrong.	Tsy misy diso.
He didn't speak anymore.	Tsy niteny intsony izy.
Only a few people first.	Olona vitsivitsy ihany aloha.
We hope to go? 	Manantena izahay fa handeha?
The other is long overdue.	Efa ela ny iray hafa.
They drove their cars.	Nitondra ny fiarany izy ireo.
I could see that he was trying hard.	Hitako fa niezaka mafy izy.
They did not tell us why.	Tsy nilaza taminay ny antony izy ireo.
I don't need them.	Tsy mila azy ireo aho.
They saw him coming.	Nahita azy tonga izy ireo.
So did we and we, really surprised.	Toy izany koa isika sy isika, tena gaga.
It is not difficult.	Tsy sarotra izany.
There was a man on the ground.	Nisy lehilahy iray teo amin’ny tany.
He behaved well over the years.	Nitondra tena tsara izy nandritra ny taona maro.
It was on me.	Teo amin'ny ahy ilay izy.
None of the latter.	Tsy misy na iray aza amin'ity farany.
It is not easy.	Tsy mora izany.
I know these cars.	Fantatro ireo fiara ireo.
We can't ask you anything else.	Tsy afaka manontany zavatra hafa aminao izahay.
He needed the money.	Nila ny vola izy.
And then we can do something.	Ary avy eo dia mety hanao zavatra isika.
It should be the news.	Tokony ho ilay vaovao.
It’s a nice little place.	Toerana kely mahafinaritra io.
Some people never learn.	Misy olona tsy mianatra mihitsy.
He doesn't have a dog.	Tsy manana alika izy.
He is not a handsome person.	Tsy olona tsara tarehy izy.
We stayed there in amazement.	Nijanona teo izahay gaga.
It happened again.	Nitranga indray izany.
That may not be true.	Tsy mety marina izany.
But you really didn’t say it would come today.	Fa tena tsy niteny ianao hoe ho avy androany.
Die with him.	Maty miaraka aminy.
But now, no.	Fa izao, tsia.
All women can get sick in the morning.	Ny vehivavy rehetra dia mety ho marary maraina.
I know I should.	Fantatro fa tokony.
No problem here.	Tsy misy olana eto.
Very bad night too.	Tena ratsy alina koa.
It’s annoying, no question.	Tezitra izany, tsy misy fanontaniana.
They were very good at things like that.	Tena tsara izy ireo tamin'ny zavatra toy izany.
It was very different.	Tena hafa mihitsy ilay izy.
Everyone needs good friends.	Mila namana tsara ny rehetra.
I already know who it is.	Efa fantatro hoe iza io.
I saw him do it.	Hitako nanao izany izy.
Yes, he is nowhere.	Eny, tsy aiza izy.
And he came quickly.	Ary tonga haingana izy.
I looked immediately.	Nijery avy hatrany aho.
Like finding money.	Toy ny nahita vola.
We all thought he was crazy.	Nihevitra izahay rehetra fa adala izy.
He will take you from there.	Izy no hitondra anao avy any.
Times are tough.	Sarotra ny fotoana.
It just didn’t happen.	Tsy nitranga fotsiny izany.
I can't talk long.	Tsy afaka miresaka lava aho.
He didn't think of anything.	Tsy nieritreritra na inona na inona izy.
In fact, it did.	Raha ny marina dia nanao izany.
There is a reason for this.	Misy antony izany.
I was hoping for that.	Nanantena izany aho.
I talked to him a lot.	Niresaka be taminy aho.
This is very good for us.	Tena tsara ho antsika izany.
He was sure it was.	Azony antoka fa izy io.
There is no reason at all.	Tsy misy antony mihitsy.
He stole money.	Nangalatra vola izy.
And that’s not the worst.	Ary tsy izany no ratsy indrindra.
Of course, he doesn’t eat anything.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy mihinana na inona na inona izy.
He thought he was dead.	Nihevitra izy fa efa maty.
We all have to work hard.	Tsy maintsy miasa mafy isika rehetra.
Who can help me?	Iza no afaka manampy ahy?
That’s a good idea.	Hevitra tsara izany.
It’s just an idea now.	Hevitra fotsiny izy izao.
They did not.	Tsy nanao izany izy ireo.
There’s a lot you still don’t understand.	Betsaka ny mbola tsy azonao.
Certainly not these.	Azo antoka fa tsy ireo.
I want you to talk to us.	Tiako hiresaka aminay ianao.
Not a wrong word about him really.	Tsy teny diso momba azy tokoa.
Not really trying.	Tsy tena miezaka.
I think they are really good.	Heveriko fa tena tsara izy ireo.
What happened.	Izay nitranga.
You can work alone.	Afaka miasa irery ianao.
He knows, too.	Fantany koa.
He started saying things but didn't say anything.	Nanomboka niteny zavatra izy nefa tsy niteny.
Bad month, that is.	Volana ratsy, izany.
We want to get it.	Te hahazo izany izahay.
I can't.	Tsy afaka aho.
It's long.	Lava ilay izy.
Whatever it is, it seems closer.	Na inona na inona izany, dia toa akaiky kokoa.
It is different now.	Hafa koa izany ankehitriny.
He never asked me for money or bought anything from me.	Tsy nangataka vola tamiko mihitsy izy, na nividy zavatra taminy.
The question arises.	Mipetraka ny fanontaniana.
But they may not have the full story.	Saingy mety tsy manana ny tantara feno izy ireo.
Well.	Eny ary.
But that's not good.	Saingy tsy tsara izany.
They arrived early.	Tonga aloha izy ireo.
They come, they go, and when they go, they are gone.	Tonga izy ireo, mandeha izy ireo, ary rehefa mandeha izy ireo dia tsy misy intsony.
Maybe you know the person.	Angamba fantatrao ilay olona.
Lots at once.	Be dia be indray mandeha.
At first, it wasn’t bad.	Tamin'ny voalohany dia tsy ratsy izany.
I called everyone.	Niantso ny rehetra aho.
I am not afraid of them.	Tsy matahotra azy ireo aho.
Maybe not both.	Angamba tsy izy roa.
He won't be home for an hour.	Tsy hody izy alohan'ny adiny iray.
They never needed two.	Tsy nila roa mihitsy izy ireo.
Can you help ?.	Afaka manampy ve ianao?.
He asked you.	Nanontany anao izy.
That might be good.	Mety ho tsara izany.
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
Don't get lost now.	Aza very izao.
I still live there.	Mbola mipetraka any aho.
He accomplished something.	Nahavita zavatra izy.
They will enter.	Hiditra izy ireo.
And he doesn’t know why.	Ary tsy fantany ny antony.
You came.	Tonga ianao.
Even longer.	Na ela kokoa aza.
He is the best !.	Izy no tsara indrindra!.
This one is for everything.	Ity iray ity dia ho an'ny zavatra rehetra.
You must have needed it.	Tsy maintsy nila izany ianao.
He just spoke.	Vao niteny izy.
I immediately stayed at home.	Nipetraka tao an-trano avy hatrany aho.
It came to him and scared him.	Tonga teo aminy izany ary natahotra azy.
Are you with me ?.	Miaraka amiko ve ianao?.
He became a small actor.	Lasa mpilalao sarimihetsika kely izy.
I don't want to talk to you.	Tsy te hiresaka aminao aho.
What a wonderful day.	Tena andro mahafinaritra.
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
I got in the car with a woman.	Niditra tao anaty fiara niaraka tamin'ny vehivavy iray aho.
But it was in him too.	Fa tao aminy koa izany.
See you tonight.	Hihaona anio alina.
They are very rude.	Tena tsy mahalala fomba izy ireo.
Don't be late.	Aza tara.
It's too late now.	Tara loatra amin’izany ankehitriny.
There is still something to be done.	Mbola misy zavatra tokony hatao.
I’ve really never seen that before.	Tena mbola tsy nahita izany mihitsy aho.
Good to be back.	Tsara ny niverina.
All is not lost yet.	Tsy mbola very daholo.
Not all is lost.	Tsy very daholo.
So you have to believe me.	Ka tsy maintsy mino ahy ianao.
If you want to see it.	Raha te hahita izany ianao.
I was also a little scared.	Somary natahotra ihany koa aho.
We had to talk about what had happened.	Tsy maintsy niresaka momba ny zava-nitranga izahay.
The rain finally came.	Tonga ihany ny orana.
He thought not.	Nihevitra izy fa tsy.
The latter is not the worst.	Ny farany dia tsy ny ratsy indrindra.
I really enjoyed the time.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy ny fotoana.
They are mine and not his.	Ahy izy ireo fa tsy azy.
So not yet.	Ka tsy mbola.
No, he didn't say that.	Tsia, tsy nilaza izany izy.
Something will happen tomorrow.	Hisy zavatra hitranga rahampitso.
It’s not easy, of course.	Tsy mora izany, mazava ho azy.
People think they are.	Mihevitra ny olona fa izy ireo.
So we have.	Noho izany dia manana isika.
Something like.	Zavatra toy ny .
That is clear.	Mazava izany.
We are both lacking now.	Samy tsy ampy isika ankehitriny.
I'm busy here.	sahirana aho eto.
It's best not to think about it too much.	Tsara raha tsy mieritreritra an’izany loatra.
If you do, it’s for you.	Raha manao izany ianao dia ho anao izany.
I was afraid of what was going to happen.	Natahotra ny zavatra hitranga aho.
They just love themselves.	Tia ny tenany fotsiny izy ireo.
They are so wrong.	Diso be izy ireo.
Everything is different when he comes home.	Hafa ny zava-drehetra rehefa mody izy.
No one knows at all.	Tsy misy mahalala mihitsy .
And so on for a few weeks.	Ary toy izany nandritra ny herinandro vitsivitsy.
He has yet to drink for himself.	Mbola tsy nisotro ho an'ny tenany izy.
I was completely happy with what happened.	Faly tanteraka aho tamin'ny zava-nitranga.
I live there.	Mipetraka any aho.
It’s not sure if it’s good or bad.	Tsy azo antoka na tsara na ratsy izany.
The child is not alive.	Tsy velona ilay zaza.
I wonder who thought that.	Manontany tena hoe iza no nieritreritra an'izany.
That's a good idea.	Tsara izany hevitra izany.
Great man.	Lehilahy lehibe.
Don’t worry we’ll go!	Aza manahy fa handeha izahay!
That's what he did.	Izany no nataony.
He lives here, not here.	Mipetraka eto izy fa tsy eto.
He said that to himself.	Nilaza tamin’ny tenany izany izy.
I believe that.	Mino izany aho.
It should be made easier.	Tokony hatao mora kokoa.
I see that.	Hitako izany.
What if .	Ahoana raha .
Everyone had told him he would be free today.	Efa nilaza taminy ny rehetra fa ho afaka izy anio.
She was happy to watch her children.	Faly izy nijery ny zanany.
It’s not like they’re drinking.	Tsy toy ny misotro izy ireo.
You should not go alone.	Tsy tokony handeha irery ianao.
I asked him if he needed to talk.	Nanontany azy aho raha mila miresaka izy.
He was just wrong.	Diso lalana fotsiny izy.
There was no more time.	Tsy nisy fotoana intsony.
I enjoyed the time.	Nahafinaritra ahy ny fotoana.
Like, everyone knows that.	Tahaka ny, fantatry ny rehetra izany.
So it is.	Toy izany koa izany.
I couldn’t think of him.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra momba azy aho.
It's hard to come by.	Sarotra ny tonga amin’izany.
It’s not that they can see a lot of things above.	Tsy hoe afaka mahita zavatra betsaka eto ambony akory izy ireo.
They came naturally, and soon.	Tonga ho azy izy ireo, ary tsy ela.
I left the unknown.	Niala tamin'ny tsy fantatra aho.
I hoped it would happen.	Nanantena aho fa ho tanteraka izany.
My place is very close to him.	Akaiky azy tokoa ny toerana misy ahy.
It only made him crazy.	Nahatonga azy ho adala ihany izany.
It just takes time.	Mila fotoana fotsiny izany.
He knows what it means to lose money.	Fantany ny atao hoe very vola.

This is a great day.	Andro lehibe izao.
I never drink them.	Tsy misotro azy ireo mihitsy aho.

At first, I didn't want to go there.	Tsy te ho any mihitsy aho tamin’ny voalohany.

Something that has to be done once.	Zavatra tsy maintsy atao indray mandeha.
Not with me, of course.	Tsy miaraka amiko, mazava ho azy.
He didn’t know why he thought he would be different.	Tsy fantany hoe nahoana izy no nieritreritra fa ho hafa izy.
You know you need one.	Fantatrao fa mila iray ianao.
It was often the most enjoyable time of the night.	Matetika no fotoana nahafinaritra indrindra tamin'ny alina.
If you’ve been there once, come back.	Raha efa nisy indray mandeha ianao dia hiverina.
The dead are.	Ny maty dia.
I just sat there.	Nipetraka teo fotsiny aho.
I believe that.	Mino izany aho.
So it is with you.	Toy izany koa ny anao.
Because it can.	Satria mety.
You may learn something.	Mety hianatra zavatra ianao.
They do not look at us or follow us.	Tsy mijery antsika na manaraka antsika izy ireo.
He wants you to live one day.	Tiany ho velona indray andro ianao.
But maybe there’s something else to it.	Fa angamba mbola misy hafa amin'izany.
I think you need time alone.	Heveriko fa mila fotoana irery ianao.
You are not the first.	Tsy ianao no voalohany.
I have come to tell you something.	Tonga hilaza zavatra aminao aho.
I needed a little time.	Nila fotoana kely aho.
They both love to sleep.	Samy tia natory izy ireo.
I am not the only one who has done this.	Tsy izaho irery no nanao an'izany.
That is exactly what he did.	Izany indrindra no nataony.
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
He never does.	Tsy manao izany mihitsy izy.

He will help us.	Hanampy antsika Izy.
He told me to stay.	Nilaza tamiko izy mba hijanona.
Time goes by.	Mandeha ny fotoana.

He needed all the help he could get.	Nila ny fanampiana rehetra azony izy.
I was scared.	Natahotra aho.
Too many things at once.	Be loatra ny zavatra indray mandeha.

I never did anything to him.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona taminy mihitsy aho.
It is the father.	Dia ilay ray .

Just a day or two.	Iray na roa andro fotsiny.
They are completely wrong.	Diso tanteraka izy ireo.
Sure, everything could be fine.	Azo antoka fa mety ho tsara daholo ny zava-drehetra.
People started calling me again.	Nanomboka niantso ahy indray ny olona.
I haven't been in there before either.	Tsy mbola niditra tao koa aloha.
We are here in the summer.	Amin'ny fahavaratra isika eto.
There was nothing here, there was nothing.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona teto, tsy nisy na inona na inona.
I know you will come back.	Fantatro fa hiverina ianao.

He entered the room.	Niditra tao amin'ilay efitrano izy.
I know what to do.	Fantatro izay tokony hatao.

Very far, it seems.	Lavitra be, toa.
I don’t know though.	Tsy haiko na dia izany aza.
All if so.	Rehetra raha izany.
They are no longer afraid.	Tsy matahotra intsony izy ireo.
I don't need it.	Tsy mila izany aho.
That is the end.	Izay no farany.
You had a great idea a few years ago.	Nanana hevitra tsara ianao tany taona vitsivitsy lasa izay.
Who are the two people in this picture?	Iza ireo olona roa amin'ity sary ity?
I asked how long he had been there.	Nanontany aho hoe hafiriana izy no tany.
I know a man.	Mahafantatra lehilahy aho.

No, just great.	Tsia, lehibe fotsiny.
Do two jobs.	Manao asa roa.
Next time we will.	Amin'ny manaraka indray isika.
It needed a man.	Nila lehilahy izany.
I think there should be more people like that, in fact.	Heveriko fa tokony ho betsaka kokoa ny olona toy izany, raha ny marina.
Very similar to the first movie.	Tena mitovy amin'ny sarimihetsika voalohany.
This is as it should be.	Izany dia araka ny tokony ho izy.
This is where you sit.	Eto ianao no mipetraka.
He had done it before and could do it again.	Efa nanao izany izy taloha ary afaka nanao izany indray.
I'll be right out.	Hivoaka avy hatrany aho.
Of course, this is not the only way.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy io ihany no lalana.
I don’t think anyone should.	Heveriko fa tsy tokony hisy olona.
It has to stay that way.	Tsy maintsy mijanona ho toy izany.
I don’t know if he will do that.	Tsy fantatro raha hanao izany izy.
It is indeed so.	Dia izany tokoa.
There was not enough paperwork in the house.	Tsy ampy ny taratasy tao an-trano.
And he decided not to just tell me.	Ary nanapa-kevitra ny tsy hilaza amiko fotsiny izy.
I saw him, and we played music.	Hitako izy, ary nilalao mozika izahay.
You only get one.	Iray ihany no azonao.
Everything is very good.	Tena tsara ny zava-drehetra.
This is mine.	Efa ahy ity.
And how were they?	Ary nanao ahoana izy ireo?
He must have had a tough week.	Tsy maintsy nanana herinandro mafy izy.
It was a lot of fun to do.	Nahafinaritra be ny nanao izany.
Rude.	Tsy mahalala fomba.
We were afraid to go out at night.	Natahotra ny hivoaka alina izahay.
Of course they are not.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izy ireo.
We can do the same here.	Afaka manao izany koa isika eto.
And his.	Ary ny azy.
And there never will be.	Ary tsy hisy mihitsy.
I mentioned it above.	Nolazaiko teo ambony io.
You know the picture.	Fantatrao ny sary.
He went well.	Nandeha tsara izy.
They seem happy, very fresh and fresh.	Toa faly izy ireo, tena vaovao sy vaovao.
I’ve thought about that before, too.	Izaho koa dia efa nieritreritra an'izany taloha.
Very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy.
Of course there was.	Mazava ho azy fa nisy.
I don’t believe he’s bad.	Tsy mino aho fa ratsy izy.
Also, it’s good to look to the future when planning.	Ary koa, tsara ny mijery ny ho avy rehefa mikasa.
I may or may not know.	Mety ho fantany na tsy fantany aho.
A few bad months, a few good months.	Volana ratsy vitsivitsy, volana tsara vitsivitsy.
It's been a long time.	Efa ela izay.
It’s a really fun book.	Tena boky mahafinaritra izy io.
That’s the only job.	Izany ihany no asa.
He tried it again.	Nanandrana izany indray izy.
Sleeping too late.	Matory tara loatra.
I think that’s exactly what it should be.	Heveriko fa tena araka ny tokony ho izy izany.
We haven’t talked about that in years.	Tsy niresaka an'izany izahay nandritra ny taona maro.
If you are lucky, they will go it alone.	Raha tsara vintana ianao, dia handeha irery izy ireo.
He saw something.	Nahita zavatra izy.
Either way, they are gone now.	Na izany na tsy izany dia lasa izy ireo izao.
But this is actually.	Saingy ity raha ny marina.
That could not be true.	Tsy mety ho marina izany.
I think it was just me.	Heveriko fa izaho ihany ilay izy.
He finally stopped.	Nijanona tamin’ny farany izy.
I was able to talk.	Afaka niresaka aho.
Children need to learn to speak.	Mila mianatra miteny ny zaza.
They did not.	Tsy nanao izany izy ireo.
He came at the right time.	Tonga tamin’ny fotoana mety izy.
There is nothing wrong.	Tsy diso na inona na inona.
So it is.	Toy izany koa izany.
Something went wrong.	Nisy zavatra tsy nety tamin’ny zava-nitranga.
Easier.	Mora kokoa.
You just need a good teacher.	Mila mpampianatra mahay fotsiny ianao.
There is nothing special about it.	Tsy misy zavatra manokana momba izany.
No, this time will be very different.	Tsia, ho hafa mihitsy ity fotoana ity.
They have had it for the last thirty years.	Nanana izany izy ireo nandritra ny telopolo taona farany.
And of course the other two.	Ary mazava ho azy ny roa hafa.
He is lost.	Very izy.
Because it is so true.	Satria tena marina izany.
The method works really well!	Tena miasa tsara ilay fomba!
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
Either way, it’s yours, if you will.	Na izany na tsy izany, anao izany, raha tianao.
It's nothing.	Tsy inona izany.
Maybe he is.	Angamba izy.
Everyone was angry with him.	Tezitra taminy ny rehetra.
A great work awaits us.	Misy asa lehibe miandry antsika.
At some point you want to do something else.	Amin'ny fotoana iray dia te hanao zavatra hafa ianao.
He did not think to do so.	Tsy nieritreritra ny hanao izany izy.
It was caused by someone else.	Olona hafa no nahatonga izany.
Not a lot of time, but it might be enough.	Tsy fotoana be, fa mety ho ampy.
They will both make the food.	Samy hanao ny sakafo izy ireo.
This girl never intended to do anything wrong.	Tsy nikasa hanao ratsy mihitsy ity tovovavy ity.
Very clever if you ask me.	Tena mahay raha manontany ahy ianao.
Too much, too much.	Be loatra, be loatra.
I am not a father.	Tsy ray aho.
Because it is.	Satria izy ilay izy.
I’m angry that someone might be like that.	Tezitra aho fa misy olona mety ho toy izany.
We may not think so, but we do.	Mety tsy mieritreritra an’izany isika, fa manao izany.
I don’t need it either.	Izaho koa tsy mila azy.
He is still very interested in her.	Tena mbola liana aminy izy.
He had to watch.	Tsy maintsy nijery izy.
This works better.	Ity asa tsara kokoa ity.
This car is quite new.	Ity fiara ity dia somary vaovao.
I love this book.	Tiako ity boky ity.
He has no close friends.	Tsy manana namana akaiky izy.
I have enough.	Manana ampy aho.
He is just like all of us.	Toy ny antsika rehetra ihany izy.
This idea may be true.	Mety ho marina io hevitra io.
They always follow the money.	Manaraka ny vola foana izy ireo.
Nothing really bad.	Tsy misy tena ratsy.
But this is kind of stupid.	Fa io no karazana adala.
I could never do anything good.	Tsy afaka nanao zavatra tsara mihitsy aho.
It's tough.	Mafy ilay izy.
This is not an easy task.	Tsy asa mora izany.
Now with the car.	Ankehitriny miaraka amin'ny fiara.
Others may do it just for him.	Ny hafa dia mety hanao izany ho azy fotsiny.
You are very alone.	Tena irery ianao.
But only if you like.	Fa raha tianao ihany.
He has many friends.	Manana namana maro izy.
I think he was happy.	Heveriko fa faly izy.
You must come.	Tokony ho avy ianareo.
It is almost here.	Efa ho akaiky izany.
This is very bad.	Tena ratsy izany.
Then we will come to the end of things.	Avy eo dia ho tonga any amin'ny faran'ny zavatra isika.
He does it like a man.	Manao izany toy ny lehilahy izy.
It is this.	Dia ity.
I am nothing anymore.	Tsy na inona na inona intsony aho.
A living dead person.	Olona maty velona.
I did a good job.	Nahavita asa tsara aho.
You were very sick.	Narary tsara ianao.
Here I am.	Eto aho.
Even from a distance, he knew it was a man.	Na dia lavitra aza dia fantany fa lehilahy io.
But it was a great day.	Fa nahafinaritra ny andro.
That tells me he’s really busy.	Izany dia milaza amiko fa tena sahirana izy.
Of course they are not.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izy ireo.
I don't know anymore.	Tsy fantany intsony aho.
The two of us.	Isika roa.
I wouldn’t know.	Tsy ho fantatro.
I believe he will.	Mino aho fa hanao izany izy.
It hasn’t gotten better yet.	Tsy mbola nahazo tsara izany.
They are no longer completely lost.	Tsy very tanteraka intsony izy ireo.
I don't even like to sleep.	Tsy tia matory akory aho.
It is not certain that this will be possible.	Tsy azo antoka fa ho azo atao izany.
And in a less pleasant way as well.	Ary amin'ny fomba tsy dia mahafinaritra koa.
I'm more worried about you.	Manahy anao kokoa aho.
He was the only one who had never heard a word from her.	Izy ihany no tsy mbola nandre teny taminy.
I think a little.	Mieritreritra kely aho.
That’s what makes it so real to all of us.	Izany no nahatonga azy ho tena misy ho antsika rehetra.
And it works for me.	Ary miasa amiko izany.
Because he was expecting something.	Satria niandry zavatra izy.
At the moment.	Amin'izao fotoana izao.
Sleep is a big one of these.	Ny torimaso dia iray lehibe amin'ireo.
They are no different now.	Tsy hafa izy ireo ankehitriny.
He lived there himself.	Ny tenany no nipetraka tao.
Nothing really seemed to happen.	Tsy nisy toa tena nisy izany.
I should have said that.	Tokony ho nilaza izany aho.
I know what he will do.	Fantatro izay hataony.
She is very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy izy.
But no children.	Saingy tsy misy zaza.
We really are.	Tena isika tokoa.
And there are a lot of them.	Ary be dia be izy ireo.
It’s a real job.	Asa tena izy io.
I studied hard.	Nianatra mafy aho.
He could have been here.	Mety ho teto izy.
He said it was better not to.	Nilaza izy fa aleo tsy.
It would be really bad.	Tena ho ratsy izany.
No matter what, people are beautiful.	Na inona na inona, tsara tarehy ny olona.
The incident is known today.	Fantatra androany ny zava-nitranga.
That’s all.	Izany no zava-drehetra.
We cannot survive without food.	Tsy ho velona isika raha tsy misy sakafo.
He came this morning, asking about you.	Tonga izy androany maraina, nanontany momba anao.
If it had been so easy, everyone would have done it.	Raha tena mora tokoa ilay izy dia ho nanao izany ny rehetra.
Don't go.	Aza mandeha.
How long has it been.	Hafiriana no nisy izany.
This again is kind of the same idea.	Ity indray no karazana hevitra mitovy.
He wanted what he wanted.	Naniry izay tiany izy.
None of this is true.	Tsy misy marina izany.
They came in from outside.	Niditra avy any ivelany ireo.
Then you go.	Dia handeha ianao.
Just tell me to stay.	Lazao fotsiny aho mba hijanona.
I really wanted a fast car.	Tena naniry fiara haingana aho.
Like, there you are.	Toy ny hoe, any ianao.
Not anymore.	Tsy izany intsony.
You will never see him or anyone like him again.	Tsy hahita azy intsony ianao na olona mitovy aminy.
He is easily confused.	Mora very hevitra izy.
When if needed.	Rahoviana izy raha ilaina.
I don’t know if that’s even possible.	Tsy haiko na azo atao aza izany.
The weekend was a great time.	Fotoana nahafinaritra ny faran’ny herinandro.
Men are good.	Tsara ny lehilahy.
Now, he knew he had to do it.	Ankehitriny, fantany fa tsy maintsy hanao izany izy.
Yes, that was too much for me.	Eny, be loatra tamiko izany.
The picture is different to me.	Tsy mitovy amiko ilay sary.
You are good.	Tsara ianao.
It seems to help a little.	Toa manampy kely izany.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
Nothing worse could have happened.	Tsy misy zavatra ratsy kokoa mety hitranga.
I love you and I enjoy being with you.	Tiako ianao ary mahafinaritra ahy ny miaraka aminao.
I wanted to be there too.	Naniry ny ho any koa aho.
He was never wrong.	Tsy diso mihitsy izy.
They are very small.	Kely dia kely izy ireo.
They are both crazy.	Adala izy roa.
He can walk.	Afaka mandeha izy.
He knew but did not know.	Fantany nefa tsy fantany.
He hurried out of the room.	Nivoaka haingana ny efitrano izy.
I got there.	Tonga tany aho.
You’ll know when you’re done.	Ho fantatrao rehefa vita ianao.
Something fun, fun.	Zavatra mahafinaritra, mahafinaritra.
I am always confused.	Very hevitra foana aho.
She loves to study.	Tia mianatra izy.
But one thing is still clear.	Saingy misy zavatra iray mbola mazava.
And this is true for many people.	Ary marina izany ho an'ny olona maro.
And he’s great.	Ary lehibe izy.
Everyone seems to know them.	Toa fantatry ny rehetra izy ireo.
It could go too far.	Mety ho lasa lavitra loatra izany.
i get it too.	azoko ihany koa.
These men can do whatever they want.	Ireo lehilahy ireo dia afaka manao izay tiany.
He tried to look up.	Niezaka nijery izy.
But there are a lot of stories I can get out of it.	Saingy betsaka ny tantara mety ho azoko ao.
That's what's wrong.	Izany no tsy mety.
They are known for that.	Fantatra amin’izany izy ireo.
That is the problem here.	Izay no olana eto.
The work is done.	Vita ny asa.
I can't go home.	Tsy afaka mody aho.
You did well.	Tsara ny nataonao.
It was fun for them.	Nahafinaritra azy ireo izany.
It was a wonderful time.	Fotoana mahafinaritra izany.
No one spoke.	Tsy nisy niteny.
I was able to leave.	Afaka niala aho.
It was fun, actually.	Nahafinaritra izany, raha ny marina.
And they are not children, any of these people.	Ary tsy zaza izy ireo, na iza na iza amin'ireo olona ireo.
I was sick.	Narary aho.
That would be good.	Ho tsara izany.
The streets are crowded today.	Feno olona ny lalana androany.
I really like the job.	Tena tiako ilay asa.
He stopped as soon as he entered the room.	Nijanona izy raha vao niditra ny efitrano.
Well, you are.	Tsara, ianao.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Tsy zavatra ratsy tanteraka izany.
Well, glad to hear that.	Tsara, faly nandre izany.
It was a great day.	Nahafinaritra ny andro.
That's how it should be.	Izany no tokony ho izy.
With two dogs.	Miaraka amin'ny alika roa.
Small money goes a long way.	Ny vola kely dia mandeha lavitra.
Angry with us.	Tezitra aminay.
I really like it.	Tena tiako.
He was not afraid.	Tsy natahotra izy.
He wanted to be a teacher one day.	Naniry ny ho mpampianatra izy indray andro any.
How many people can say that ?.	Firy ny olona afaka miteny izany?.
And he always had to learn.	Ary tsy maintsy nianatra foana izy.
You are so stupid.	Adala be ianao.
It needs everyone.	Mila ny rehetra izany.
They came out and something happened.	Nivoaka izy ireo ary nisy zava-nitranga.
It was fun to watch.	Nahafinaritra azy ny nijery.
It could go farther and faster.	Afaka nandeha lavitra sy haingana kokoa izany.
A big mistake for me.	Fahadisoana lehibe amiko.
Within a few months.	Tao anatin'ny volana vitsivitsy.
Everything is for us now.	Ny zava-drehetra ho antsika amin'izao fotoana izao.
Two, because it’s so good.	Ny roa, satria tena tsara izany.
The girl thought she was beautiful.	Nihevitra ilay tovovavy fa tsara tarehy izy.
You know it’s time for a new person.	Fantatrao fa tonga ny fotoana ho an'ny olona vaovao.
But it is not necessary.	Saingy tsy ilaina izany.
They are both children.	Samy zaza ihany izy roa.
Never heard of him, not known who he is.	Tsy mbola nandre momba azy, tsy fantatra hoe iza izy.
He will do it.	Izy no hanao izany.
This is another story.	Tantara hafa izany.
I almost died of fear.	Saika maty aho natahotra.
But, you know, it doesn’t matter.	Saingy, fantatrao, tsy maninona izany.
Right now it seems like it never existed.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia toy ny tsy teo mihitsy.
They tried and tried.	Nanandrana sy nanandrana izy ireo.
He started to get sick.	Nanomboka narary izy.
Seems like it’s never enough.	Toy ny tsy ampy mihitsy.
The book is good.	Tsara ny boky.
I went to the moon.	Nankany amin'ny volana aho.
So, it will still happen.	Noho izany, mbola hitranga izany.
We used to always go there.	Tonga tany foana izahay taloha.
In fact, he still does.	Raha ny marina dia mbola manao izany izy.
Even once.	Indray mandeha aza.
There was no such thing.	Tsy nisy toy izany.
It doesn’t matter how difficult this issue is.	Tsy maninona na dia sarotra toy inona aza ity olana ity.
He was the worst of many.	Izy no ratsy indrindra tamin'ny maro.
This is impossible.	Tsy azo atao mihitsy izany.
I don't see much of the mistake.	Tsy hitako loatra ilay fahadisoana.
They are known for that.	Fantatra amin’izany izy ireo.
They never thought of me.	Tsy nieritreritra ahy mihitsy izy ireo.
It's nothing.	Tsy inona izany.
I’m not saying it’s easy but it’s possible.	Tsy miteny aho hoe mora fa azo atao.

I'm in one now.	Ao anatin'ny iray aho izao.
He's busy, it's.	Sahirana izy, ilay izy.
Last month, but nothing.	Tamin'ny volana lasa, fa na inona na inona.
He loves it.	Tiany izany.
I didn't get it.	Tsy nahazo aho.
Nothing more like that.	Tsy mihoatra ny zavatra toy izany.
However, not too much.	Na izany aza, tsy dia be loatra.
Good for tonight.	Tsara ho an'ny anio alina.
Difficult place.	Toerana sarotra.
He just wanted to talk, and we talked.	Te hiresaka fotsiny izy, ary niresaka izahay.
Even if we don’t have it.	Na dia tsy manana izany aza isika.
It read a lot of questions.	Namaky fanontaniana be dia be izany.
But that place had to spend a lot of money.	Saingy tsy maintsy nandany vola be io toerana io.
But they are good.	Saingy tsara izy ireo.
No problem with that.	Tsy misy olana amin'izany.
It could have been better.	Mety ho tsara kokoa izany.
One is not necessarily better than the other.	Tsy voatery hoe tsara kokoa noho ny iray ny iray.
How long is still unknown.	Hafiriana no mbola tsy fantatra.
Only the first one happened.	Ny voalohany ihany no nitranga.
And they want to leave.	Ary te hiala izy ireo.
But, here we are.	Saingy, eto isika.
But often not.	Saingy matetika tsy izany.
Of course he got it.	Mazava ho azy fa azony.
He died three years ago.	Maty izy telo taona lasa izay.
Yes, he is more than me.	Eny, izy mihoatra noho izaho.
It will never happen.	Tsy hisy mihitsy izany.
The timing was right.	Nety tsara ilay fotoana.
And whatever it is, everything will be fine.	Ary na inona na inona izany, dia ho tsara ny zava-drehetra.
He got out of there.	Nivoaka tany izy.
It goes well.	Mandeha tsara.
Someone was in trouble.	Nisy olona sahirana.
It took a lot of time.	Nandany fotoana be izany.
I already have an idea.	Efa manana hevitra aho.
It takes two hours.	Mandeha ny adiny roa.
There were other dangers as well.	Nisy loza hafa koa.
There was a time.	Nisy fotoana.
He received a letter from his former teacher.	Nahazo taratasy avy tamin’ny mpampianatra azy taloha izy.
It will be beautiful one night.	Ho tsara tarehy indray mandeha alina.
That future has come.	Tonga izany ho avy izany.
It won't be like that for me.	Tsy ho toy izany ny ahy.
I'm still scared of that.	Mbola matahotra an'izany aho.
Never came back.	Tsy niverina intsony.
This is very bad.	Tena ratsy izany.
He wanted to see her.	Tiany hahita azy.
Now there is no problem.	Ankehitriny dia tsy misy olana.
I asked them why they were making the trip.	Nanontany azy ireo aho hoe nahoana izy ireo no nanao ilay dia.
The first is music.	Ny voalohany dia mozika.
He just needs help.	Mila fanampiana fotsiny izy.
It’s like you’re finding a special moment.	Toy ny hoe mahita fotoana manokana ianao.
I don't see him now.	Tsy mahita azy izao.
Not hard.	Tsy mafy.
The great and.	Ny lehibe sy.
Let's go.	Aleo isika mandeha.
History is not enough.	Tsy ampy ny tantara.
The real thing.	Ny tena izy.
This movie is not very good.	Tsy dia tsara loatra io sarimihetsika io.
They came to me.	Tonga ho ahy izy ireo.
For an hour.	Nandritra ny adiny iray.
But there was, there had to be.	Saingy nisy izany, tsy maintsy nisy izany.
Very bad.	Tena ratsy be.
I want to be needed.	Te ho ilaina aho.
We don’t say anything.	Tsy miteny na inona na inona izahay.
There has never been such an idea.	Tsy mbola nisy hevitra toy izany.
I’m really scared of everything.	Tena matahotra ny zava-drehetra aho.
We don’t need it now.	Tsy mila izany isika ankehitriny.
No one had one.	Tsy nisy nanana iray.
It goes well.	Mandeha tsara.
Here again, two things happened.	Eto indray dia nisy zavatra roa nitranga.
He didn't say anything at first.	Tsy niteny na inona na inona izy tamin’ny voalohany.
I was crazy once, and only once.	Adala aho indray mandeha, ary indray mandeha ihany.
They are looking for me now.	Mitady ahy izy ireo ankehitriny.
It didn’t exist before.	Tsy nisy izany taloha.
Of course they do now.	Mazava ho azy fa manao izany amin'izao fotoana izao.
This has never happened to me.	Mbola tsy nitranga tamiko mihitsy izany.
If he died, he would know.	Raha maty izy, dia ho fantany.
She’s really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra izy.
You can stay with us tonight.	Afaka mijanona eto aminay ianao anio alina.
I go to work every day.	Mandeha miasa isan'andro aho.
Isn't it ?.	Sa tsy izany?.
He said he had a good letter from you.	Nilaza izy fa manana taratasy tsara avy aminao.
Even those words angered me.	Tezitra na dia ireo teny ireo aza.
And when they die, it’s fun.	Ary raha maty izy ireo dia mahafinaritra izany.
And it would be crazy.	Ary ho adala izany.
He was mad at me.	Tezitra tamiko izy.
They leave.	Miala izy ireo.
I have never worked so hard.	Mbola tsy niasa mafy toy izao aho.
The children were very happy.	Faly be ireo ankizy.
It’s not a bad or wrong thing to do.	Tsy zavatra ratsy na tsy mety izany.
And to his surprise, it was the same.	Ary gaga izy, mitovy ihany.
No, that's enough!	Tsia, ampy izay!
If you have me, that's it.	Raha manana ahy ianao dia izay.
they were in the most difficult place.	teo amin'ny toerana sarotra indrindra izy ireo.
I don’t like little dogs.	Tsy tiako ny alika kely.
This girl is very sick.	Marary mafy ity tovovavy ity.
He traveled a long way.	Nanao dia lavitra izy.
Something like the following.	Zavatra toy izao manaraka izao.
He should have done a lot of things.	Tokony ho nanao zavatra maro izy.
That's the bad reason.	Izany no antony ratsy.
It doesn’t help either.	Tsy manampy koa izany.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Betsaka ny asa miandry.
He once told me he loved to swim.	Indray mandeha dia nilaza tamiko izy fa tia milomano.
Not me, of course.	Tsy izaho, mazava ho azy.
It’s a lot of hard work.	Asa mafy be izany.
During this time, he wrote music for the first two.	Nandritra izany fotoana izany dia nanoratra ny mozika ho an'ny roa voalohany izy.
Many students do not read books.	Betsaka ny mpianatra tsy mamaky boky.
For hours and hours.	Ho an'ny ora sy ora.
I wouldn't be able to do that then.	Tsy ho vitako izany raha izany.
No no no.	Tsia tsia tsia.
It is big and beautiful.	Lehibe sy tsara tarehy izy io.
He must have been terrified.	Natahotra mafy angamba izy.
He wants to come back.	Te hiverina izy.
The wrong one too.	Ilay diso koa.
They returned.	Niverina izy ireo.
What if.	Ahoana raha toa ka.

So again.	Toy izany indray.
We can't wait.	Tsy afaka miandry isika.
It’s not that you couldn’t speak.	Tsy hoe tsy afaka niteny ianao.
He was there once.	Indray mandeha teo izy.
It seemed easy to get them in the first place.	Toy ny hoe mora ny nahazo azy ireo teo amin’ny toerana voalohany.

Really, really good.	Tena, tena tsara.
There was a water problem.	Nisy ny olana momba ny rano.
He knows them well.	Fantany tsara izy ireo.

You have to do it, no matter what.	Tsy maintsy manao izany ianao, na inona na inona.
It would be nice if it was done.	Tsara raha vita izany.
I had to tell him.	Tsy maintsy nilaza taminy aho.
The word is not clear.	Tsy mazava ny teny.
All that, but much more than that.	Izany rehetra izany, fa mihoatra lavitra noho izany.
Either way, we’re going to lose a man.	Na izany na tsy izany, ho very lehilahy isika.
He really is.	Izy tokoa.
Lots of new people.	Be dia be ny olona vaovao.
Because he needed it.	Satria nila izany izy.
You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.	Tsy manana na inona na inona ho very ianao ary ny zavatra rehetra ho azo.
We have a place waiting for you.	Manana toerana miandry anao izahay.
He didn't wait any longer.	Tsy niandry intsony izy.
You don’t have to be selfish.	Tsy tokony ho tia tena ianao.
We want to be sure.	Te hahazo antoka izahay.
I know this, you know this.	Fantatro ity, fantatrao ity.
And now I am.	Ary izao aho.
Although the journey was long, we finally arrived.	Na dia lavitra aza ilay dia, dia tonga ihany izahay.
He! ' 	Izy!'
If he went anywhere.	Raha nandeha na aiza na aiza izy.
But now that he’s with a lot of people.	Saingy rehefa niaraka tamin'ny olona maro be dia be izy izao.
We tried them one day.	Nanandrana azy ireo izahay indray andro.
This one does the work.	Ity iray ity no manao ny asa.
She didn't try with other men.	Tsy nanandrana niaraka tamin’ny lehilahy hafa izy.
Me too.	Izaho koa.
Now two people went to the little house.	Ankehitriny dia nisy olona roa nandeha nankany amin'ny trano kely.
It’s fun, too.	Mahafinaritra koa izany.
I did something wrong.	Nanao zavatra tsy nety aho.
I did something.	nanao zavatra aho.
Sorry, something went wrong.	Miala tsiny fa nisy tsy nety.
We will be home soon.	Hody tsy ho ela izahay.
It's been over two years now.	Efa roa taona mahery izao izany.
How are you	Manao ahoana ianao?
This song is more than just a song.	Mihoatra noho ny hira fotsiny ity hira ity.
It’s the same.	Mitovy ihany izy.
Dinner only.	Sakafo hariva ihany.
He didn't seem to know what he was doing anymore.	Toa tsy fantany intsony ny zavatra nataony.
He has come a long way now.	Efa tonga lavitra izao izy.
I'm happy about that.	Faly aho noho izany.
It’s so nice to see you here again.	Tena mahafinaritra ny mahita anao eto indray.

Also good for sleep.	Tsara koa ho an'ny torimaso.

I think you can help me, you can even see it.	Heveriko fa afaka manampy ahy ianao, afaka mahita azy mihitsy aza.
It’s really hard to work for adults.	Tena sarotra ny miasa ho an'ny lehibe.
I don't even know you.	Tsy fantatro akory ianao.
But it doesn’t go that way.	Saingy tsy mandeha toy izany.
Then he got it.	Dia azony.
I need to buy you.	Mila mividy anao aho.
Here I need help.	Eto aho mila fanampiana.
It seems that, recently, they have come across something lost.	Toa izy ireo, vao haingana, dia tonga amin'ny zavatra very.
There’s a lot about it now.	Be dia be ny momba izany ankehitriny.
This story is one of the last.	Ity tantara ity dia iray amin'ireo farany.
Maybe, but that’s a different story.	Dia angamba, saingy tantara hafa izany.
Thank you for being a friend.	Misaotra anao ho namana.
It’s just not there.	Tsy eo fotsiny izy io.
It works, and it works well.	Mandeha izy io, ary miasa tsara.
There may be risks.	Mety hisy loza mety hitranga.
It looks like rain.	Toa orana.

You are not me.	Tsy izaho ianao.

The news does something like this.	Ny vaovao dia manao zavatra toy izao.
It can be hard to get the right one.	Mety ho sarotra ny mahazo ny tsara.
This is still true.	Mbola marina izany.
That's what can be done.	Izay no mety hatao.
But in fact, it wasn’t all there.	Saingy raha ny marina, tsy nisy izany rehetra izany.
There are a lot of things.	Misy zavatra betsaka.
This is a very difficult thing.	Zavatra sarotra be izany.
So I have to do it.	Ka tsy maintsy manao izany aho.

It’s an instant photo.	Sary avy hatrany io.
I know that is true.	Fantatro fa marina izany.
That's what happened.	Izany no nitranga.
That's your opinion.	Izay ny hevitrao.
Something like that.	Zavatra toy izany.
No one wanted to talk to me anymore.	Tsy nisy te hiresaka tamiko intsony.
And they did so.	Dia nanao izany izy ireo.
That is a very important reason.	Tena antony lehibe tokoa izany.
No one cares about the car.	Tsy misy miraharaha ny fiara.

It is a very good letter.	Tena taratasy tsara izy io.
If you have any news, fine.	Raha manana vaovao ianao dia tsara.
I wondered about the others.	Nanontany tena momba ny hafa aho.
But we will find a way.	Fa hahita fomba isika.
It also seems like a long day.	Toa andro lava be koa izany.
People have long since stopped watching.	Efa ela ny olona no tsy nijery intsony.
We hoped he was right.	Nanantena izahay fa marina izy.
He helped a lot.	Nanampy betsaka izy.
The girl looked at him.	Nijery azy ilay tovovavy.
I am happy with this book.	Faly aho amin'ity boky ity.

But don't worry.	Fa aza manahy ianao.
Now more than ever.	Ankehitriny mihoatra noho ny taloha.
It is absolutely unnecessary.	Tena tsy ilaina mihitsy izany.

Both will do great work.	Samy hanao asa lehibe izy roa.
He no longer believes.	Tsy mino intsony izy.
For a few minutes.	Nandritra ny minitra vitsivitsy.
He was surprised.	Gaga izy.
This is the big house.	Io no trano lehibe.
Especially the stupid stuff.	Indrindra ny zavatra adala.
We used to talk a lot.	Niresaka lava be izahay taloha.
Maybe that’s what got me out of the room.	Angamba izany no nahatonga ahy hivoaka ny efitrano.

More difficult, but impossible.	Sarotra kokoa, fa tsy azo atao.
He was very happy to hear me.	Tena faly izy nandre ahy.

Only us.	Isika ihany.
If he did, it worked.	Raha nanao izany izy dia niasa.
Then we leave.	Dia miala izahay.

I went in with him.	Niditra niaraka taminy aho.
I thought I was really crazy.	Nihevitra aho fa tena adala.
I don't know what to do.	Tsy hitako izay hatao.
I remember it all now.	Tadidiko daholo izao.
We had a good conversation.	Niresaka tsara izahay.

So, do you want to be with me once?	Ka, te hiaraka amiko ve ianao indray mandeha?
He wrote a lot.	Nanoratra betsaka izy.
It has all been there.	Efa nisy izany rehetra izany.
It was the best time of the year.	Io no fotoana tsara indrindra tamin'ny taona.

Enough for both of us.	Ampy ho antsika roa.
I did and it was a huge help.	Nataoko izany ary tena fanampiana lehibe izany.
He got what he wanted.	Nahazo izay tiany izy.

They are mine.	Ahy ireo.
He must have heard.	Tsy maintsy nandre izy.

I didn't do anything else.	Tsy nanao zavatra hafa aho.

It’s very familiar, in fact.	Tena zatra izany, raha ny marina.
I tried to be as honest as possible.	Niezaka ny ho marina araka izay azo atao aho.
Before it existed.	Fony tsy mbola nisy izany.
Because that's what he's supposed to do.	Satria izany no tokony hataony.
Not far.	Tsy lavitra.
He wasn't sure what he wanted to do.	Tsy azony antoka izay tiany hatao.
He needed water.	Nila rano izy.
That’s something special.	Izany zavatra manokana izany.
We don’t have that many people there.	Tsy manana olona betsaka toy izany izahay any.

This is not the first time.	Tsy vao voalohany izany.
It might stay, for sure.	Mety hijanona izany, azo antoka.
We women did it.	Izahay vehivavy no nanao izany.

I'm just worried.	Manahy fotsiny aho.
Of course, he did not enter the room.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy niditra tao amin’ilay efitrano izy.

And you have to do it first.	Ary tsy maintsy manao izany ianao amin'ny voalohany.
I always have.	Manana foana aho.
Of course, we will not learn anything from that either.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy hianatra na inona na inona avy amin'izany koa isika.
The trip was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra ilay dia.
It seems hard to find something like that.	Toa sarotra ny mahita zavatra toy izany.

You speak clearly and well.	Miteny mazava sy tsara ianao.
And in money.	Ary amin'ny vola.

He ate quickly.	Nihinana haingana izy.
Toa.	Toa .
They came here.	Tonga teto izy ireo.

It’s harder than that.	Sarotra kokoa noho izany izany.
He wasn't too scared.	Tsy dia natahotra loatra izy.
To me, the two are small.	Amiko dia kely ny roa.

He could be crazy, of course.	Mety ho adala izy, mazava ho azy.

I found another way.	Nahita fomba hafa aho.

It will be difficult for him.	Ho sarotra aminy izany.

It was a difficult time.	Fotoana sarotra izany.
I didn’t do too much.	Tsy dia nanao be loatra aho.
I just study and try to do things.	Mianatra fotsiny aho ary miezaka manao zavatra.
What an idea.	Hevitra inona izany.
You seem to know a lot about this girl.	Toa mahafantatra zavatra betsaka momba an'io tovovavy io ianao.
He hoped such news would come, but it would not be long.	Nanantena izy fa ho avy ny vaovao toy izany, saingy tsy ho ela.
I am with you to the end.	Miaraka aminao hatramin'ny farany aho.
He has a lot of books.	Manana boky be dia be izy.
But gone once.	Saingy lasa indray mandeha.
From beginning to end.	Hatramin'ny voalohany ka hatramin'ny farany.
I'm glad to be back.	Faly aho niverina.
He knows himself well.	Fantany tsara ny tenany.
This is very difficult for me.	Tena sarotra amiko izany.
It was even worse, because he couldn’t help it.	Mbola ratsy kokoa izany, satria tsy afaka nanampy izy.
He spoke immediately.	Niteny avy hatrany izy.
Don't say that.	Aza miteny toy izany.
I need to start earning money right away.	Mila nanomboka nahazo vola avy hatrany aho.
Thank you for watching.	Misaotra anao nijery.
We are excited about these guys.	Mahafinaritra anay ny momba ireo lehilahy ireo.
Everything is possible now.	Ny zavatra rehetra dia azo atao amin'izao fotoana izao.
I'm not very good at it.	Tsy dia mahay aho.
I see why.	Hitako hoe nahoana.
What was wrong with him?	Inona no tsy nety taminy?
I met a lot of people.	Nihaona tamin'ny olona be dia be aho.
But only for now.	Fa amin'izao fotoana izao ihany.
However, it came to the ground.	Na izany aza, dia tonga teo amin'ny tany.
The end has finally come and I am happy.	Tonga ihany ny farany ary faly aho.
Next summer.	Ny fahavaratra manaraka.
He is always very good.	Tena tsara foana izy.
I didn’t help the police much.	Tsy dia nanampy ny polisy aho.
He has good days and bad days.	Manana andro tsara sy andro ratsy izy.
Apparently no one does that at all.	Toa tsy misy manao izany mihitsy.
It’s that fast now.	Haingana toy izany izy izao.
He wants to make this movie.	Te hanao ity sarimihetsika ity izy.
I was young then.	Mbola kely aho tamin’izany.
Money was not a problem.	Tsy nisy olana ny vola.
It's completely different from the movie.	Hafa tanteraka amin’ilay sarimihetsika ilay izy.
Not everyone is happy.	Tsy ny rehetra no faly.
Or a history book.	Na boky tantara.
But that’s a problem with a long history.	Saingy olana amin'ny tantara lava izany.
And they are not alone.	Ary tsy izy ireo ihany.
I don’t think we get there yet.	Heveriko fa mbola tsy tonga any isika.
And we did.	Ary nanao izany izahay.
They are always looking at them.	Mijery azy ireo foana izy ireo.
You know what they look like.	Fantatrao hoe manao ahoana izy ireo.
And for other reasons as well.	Ary noho ny antony hafa koa.
He thinks too much that it’s not at all.	Mieritreritra be loatra izy fa tsy izany mihitsy.
But there were you kids.	Fa nisy ianareo ankizy.
Did you know that it looks like us.	Fantatrao ve fa toa antsika izany.
From little to nothing.	Avy amin'ny kely noho ny tsy misy izany.
He learns as he walks.	Mianatra izy rehefa mandeha.
But beauty is better.	Fa tsara kokoa ny tsara tarehy.
Others are not so much.	Ny hafa tsy dia be loatra.
I don’t know what could happen to me.	Tsy fantatro izay mety hitranga amiko.
They often speak too fast to me.	Matetika izy ireo no miteny haingana loatra amiko.
But you are very good.	Fa tsara be ianao.
Just something else.	Zavatra hafa ihany.
To be with him.	Ny hiaraka aminy.
He did it.	Izy no nanao izany.
Never hesitate.	Aza misalasala mihitsy.
He didn't know what to do.	Tsy fantany izay hataony.
Of course they will.	Mazava ho azy fa hanao izany izy ireo.
Once, someone helped us.	Indray mandeha, nisy iray nanampy anay.
It sounds fun.	Toa mahafinaritra izany.
He is, he is.	Izy dia, izy.
There is no question about that.	Tsy misy fanontaniana momba izany.
I told him it would happen.	Nolazaiko taminy fa ho tanteraka izany.
Whatever happens will happen.	Na inona na inona hitranga dia hitranga.
He made it really easy.	Nataony ho mora tokoa ilay izy.
He does the same.	Manao toy izany koa izy.
Then he eats it.	Dia mihinana azy izy.
He had no room for anything else.	Tsy nanana toerana ho an'ny zavatra hafa izy.
We need information.	Mila vaovao isika.
I was good at it.	Nahay tsara aho tamin'izany.
They seemed to have no end.	Toa tsy nisy farany izy ireo.
He told me that.	Nilaza tamiko izany izy.
He seemed to understand it well.	Toa azony tsara ilay izy.
I looked at them.	Nijery azy ireo aho.
This is absolutely true.	Marina tanteraka izany.
He gave way.	Nanome lalana izy.
Not that they can go far.	Tsy hoe afaka mandeha lavitra izy ireo.
And he is still alive.	Ary mbola velona izy.
He was very sure.	Tena azony antoka.
I wonder if this will be for me anytime soon.	Manontany tena aho raha ho ahy tsy ho ela ity.
There has to be a better way.	Tsy maintsy misy fomba tsara kokoa.
We will do it because we have to.	Hanao izany izahay satria tsy maintsy atao.
I never ate it.	Tsy nihinana izany mihitsy aho.
I love watching it.	Tiako ny mijery azy.
I didn’t need to say that.	Tsy nila niteny izany aho.
You don’t like it, of course.	Tsy tianao izany, mazava ho azy.
It’s powerful.	Mahery io.
He could not decide.	Tsy afaka nanapa-kevitra izy.
This is very wrong.	Tena diso izany.
I have never seen him sit and study.	Mbola tsy hitako mihitsy izy nipetraka sy nianatra.
But not too far away.	Saingy tsy dia lavitra.
It's very true.	Tena marina ny.
We'll get back to that.	Hiverina amin’izany isika.
He doesn’t like himself.	Tsy tiany ny tenany.
That’s what it’s about.	Izany no momba izany.
Otherwise it is too little.	Raha tsy izany dia kely loatra.
It is not known why they are there.	Tsy fantatra hoe nahoana izy ireo no ao.
First he had to learn more about himself.	Voalohany dia tsy maintsy nianatra bebe kokoa momba ny tenany izy.
They work for me.	Miasa ho ahy izy ireo.
Here at the moment.	Eto amin'izao fotoana izao.
That is still not enough.	Mbola tsy ampy izany.
They told him to stay close.	Niteny taminy izy ireo mba hijanona ho akaiky.
I enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra ahy izany.
There is a lot of music like that now.	Be dia be izao ny mozika toy izany.
There is no right path.	Tsy misy lalana marina.
Yes, you get the idea.	Eny, azonao ny hevitra.
It was a great day.	Nahafinaritra ny andro.
It helped me.	Nanampy ahy izany.
He said he wanted to see them if he could.	Nilaza izy fa te hahita azy ireo raha azony atao.
They are the same now.	Mitovy izy ireo ankehitriny.
So there it is.	Koa misy izany.
Of course you won’t.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy hanao izany ianao.
About many things.	Momba ny zavatra maro.
I worry about people.	Manahy momba ny olona aho.
To my surprise, he didn’t give any advice.	Gaga aho fa tsy nanome hevitra izy.
Or maybe they haven't gotten there yet.	Na angamba mbola tsy tonga tamin’izany izy ireo.
It’s about me, not hers.	Momba ahy io fa tsy azy.
They are everywhere.	Eny rehetra eny izy ireo.
I never got that from him.	Tsy azoko mihitsy izany avy aminy.
Which went like nothing happened.	Izay nandeha toy ny tsy nisy na inona na inona.
He didn't have to tell her.	Tsy voatery nilaza taminy izy.
Everyone is ready.	Efa vonona ny rehetra.
Not only bad.	Tsy hoe ratsy ihany.
Maybe he was lost.	Angamba very izy.
I'm just angry.	Tezitra fotsiny aho.
Although it's not very nice to see me.	Na tsy dia tsara aza ny mahita ahy.
I'll be back in a few days.	Mbola hiverina aho afaka andro vitsivitsy.
Thus.	Araka izany .
He just can’t.	Tsy afaka fotsiny izy.
I think he saw us leave.	Heveriko fa nahita anay niala izy.
He worked hard for many years.	Niasa mafy nandritra ny taona maro izy.
This is also incorrect.	Ity koa dia tsy mety.
He couldn't stop.	Tsy afaka nijanona izy.
I got it.	azoko izy.
A little time here.	Fotoana kely eto.
This is still true today.	Mbola marina izany ankehitriny.
We arrived late for the party yesterday.	Tara vao tonga izahay tamin'ny fety omaly.
He wanted to be outside.	Naniry ny ho any ivelany izy.
People have to do it for themselves.	Tsy maintsy manao izany ho an'ny tenany ny olona.
Work on it, have the best fit.	Miasa amin'izany, manana ny mety indrindra.
The always.	Ilay foana.
Others say it is always there.	Ny hafa milaza fa eo foana izy io.
I don’t want to do that anymore.	Tsy te hanao izany intsony koa aho.
He is his car.	Izy no fiarany.
None of these things.	Tsy misy amin'ireo zavatra ireo.
I don’t know how to do it.	Tsy haiko ny fomba hanaovana izany.
He is just a child.	Zaza ihany izy.
That's enough for me.	Ampy ahy izany.
That sounds bad.	Toa ratsy izany.
If you get here, you can’t see it.	Raha tonga eto ianao dia tsy afaka mahita azy.
It is very true.	Tena marina tokoa.
We didn’t have to.	Tsy nanana izahay.
Only those who arrived late.	Ireo tonga tara ihany no tonga.
I will do it for you.	Hataoko ho anao izany.
There is no such place.	Tsy misy toerana toy izany.
He doesn't like that dog.	Tsy tiany io alika io.
The old days are gone.	Lasa ny andro taloha.
Eventually, it all went away.	Farany, lasa daholo ny rehetra.
I did not see them.	Tsy nahita azy ireo aho.
Women can also play as men.	Afaka milalao toy ny lehilahy ihany koa ny vehivavy.
Long haul.	Dia lavitra.
He doesn't say.	Tsy milaza izy.
It used to come and go.	Tonga sy mandeha izy io taloha.
You have come a long way.	Efa lasa lavitra ianao.
They have long done so in a way.	Efa ela izy ireo no nanao izany tamin'ny fomba iray.
Of course they are wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa diso izy ireo.
Everyone is happy that he lost his job.	Faly ny rehetra fa very asa izy.
I asked him to join me next week.	Nangataka azy hiaraka amiko aho amin'ny herinandro ambony.
There was another reason.	Nisy antony hafa koa.
Someone has been doing this to me for a long time.	Nisy olona nanao izany tamiko efa ela.
They got it last.	Nahazo izany farany izy ireo.
They are different.	Samy hafa izy ireo.
I’ve written about it before.	Efa nanoratra momba izany aho taloha.
And he does.	Ary manao izany izy.
I have a very good idea.	Manana hevitra tena tsara aho.
From his room.	Avy amin'ny efitranony.
I never told you.	Tsy nilaza taminao mihitsy aho.
I am very happy.	Tena faly aho.
I'm not you.	tsy ianao aho.
To me women think that way.	Amiko ny vehivavy dia mieritreritra toy izany.
But he didn’t really tell her no.	Saingy tsy nilaza taminy marina izy hoe tsia.
Thank you, that's great.	Misaotra anao, tena tsara izany.
Two policemen came quickly.	Nisy polisy roa tonga haingana.
No good work here.	Tsy misy asa tsara eto.
I was the only woman in the room.	Izaho irery no vehivavy tao amin’ilay efitrano.
That sounds like a good idea.	Toa hevitra tsara izany.
He didn't even call.	Tsy niantso akory izy.
Don’t think too hard.	Aza mieritreritra mafy.
Like yes, it will come true.	Toy ny eny, ho tanteraka izany.
This man is looking for something.	Mitady zavatra ity lehilahy ity.
He could watch.	Afaka nijery izy.
As for you, he doesn’t exist.	Raha ny momba anao dia tsy misy izy.
And it’s not good to look at me like that either.	Ary tsy tsara koa ny mijery ahy toy izany.
Whether this or not.	Na ity na tsia.
He had heard.	Efa nandre izy.
We have never heard of them.	Tsy mbola nandre momba azy ireo izahay.
It must have been a lot of fun.	Azo antoka fa nahafinaritra be ilay izy.

And it’s different.	Ary hafa izany.

He knows all about it.	Fantany daholo ny momba izany.
I did nothing wrong.	Tsy nanao ratsy aho.
We work for you.	Miasa ho anao izahay.
Yes, he may and may not do so.	Eny, mety hanao izany izy ary mety tsy hanao izany.
But they do.	Saingy manao izany izy ireo.
He tried to think of something else.	Niezaka nieritreritra zavatra hafa izy.
Yes, you are one.	Eny, iray ianao.
John, he will never understand.	John, tsy ho azony mihitsy.
Everyone knows you’re here and knows the real story.	Fantatry ny rehetra fa eto ianao ary mahafantatra ny tena tantara.

He refused to come.	Tsy nety ho avy izy.
This is the only opportunity for them.	Izany no hany fahafahana ho azy ireo.
Many have already died.	Efa maro no maty.
We are almost here.	Saika eto isika.
From home.	Avy ao an-trano.
It may be the same if the woman is different.	Mety ho toy izany koa izy raha hafa ilay vehivavy.
I need you.	Mila anao aho.
And many a few more.	Ary maro hafa kely kokoa.
What is lost?	Inona no very?
No, sorry friends.	Tsia, miala tsiny ry namana.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra.
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
He said he wasn't sure.	Nilaza izy fa tsy azony antoka.
Everyone can speak.	Afaka miteny ny rehetra.
That’s what made me.	Izany no nahatonga ahy.
I want to know what you think.	Tiako ho fantatra ny hevitrao.
The paper could be lost here for years.	Mety ho very eto mandritra ny taona maro ny taratasy.
Others were too scared.	Natahotra loatra ny hafa.
He must be confused.	Tsy maintsy ho very hevitra izy.
They shouldn’t have known.	Tsy tokony ho fantany.
They don’t even know you’re here.	Tsy fantany akory fa eto ianao.
It may be so, or it may not be.	Mety ho toy izany, na mety tsy ho.
He didn't want to talk.	Tsy te hiresaka izy.
You know nothing.	Tsy mahalala na inona na inona ianao.
He left the meeting.	Nivoaka ny fivoriana izy.
Or, well.	Na, tsara.
Faster, faster.	Haingana, haingana kokoa.
But he lost his reason.	Fa very antony izy.
He says something, he says something.	Milaza zavatra izy, milaza zavatra izy.
You are not dead.	Tsy maty ianao.
This building is nearing completion.	Efa akaiky ho vita ity trano ity.
He wanted to do it.	Naniry ny hanao izany izy.
I haven't even heard from you in two years.	Tsy nandre anao akory aho nandritra ny roa taona.
New and old.	Vaovao sy taloha.
All the kids were so much fun.	Tena mahafinaritra ny ankizy rehetra.
That’s probably what happened here.	Izany angamba no nitranga teto.
He really needed to be away.	Tena nila tsy teo izy.
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
And you need to stay.	Ary mila mijanona ianao.
You can't say anything.	Tsy afaka miteny na inona na inona ianao.
The idea is clear.	Mazava tsara ny hevitra.
But that is a mistake.	Fa fahadisoana izany.
I believe this is the problem.	Mino aho fa io no olana.
He seemed to have it all.	Toa nanana izany rehetra izany izy.
He said that.	Nilaza izany izy.
Just the paper.	Ny taratasy ihany.
It couldn’t be what he wanted, but he did it anyway.	Tsy nety ho izay tiany izany, saingy nataony ihany izany.
You won't even like it.	Tsy ho tianao akory.
What happened will never happen again.	Tsy hitranga intsony ny zava-nitranga.
Like, a lot of people saw it.	Toy ny hoe, maro ny olona nahita izany.
No, it's real.	Tsia fa tena izy.
It drove me crazy.	Nahatonga ahy ho adala izany.
Very easy.	Tena mora.
I haven't seen it yet.	Tsy mbola nahita izany.
But the hard truth is different.	Fa ny tena marina mafy dia hafa.
You are dead.	Efa maty ianao.
There aren’t many.	Tsy dia misy firy.
I want them to be happy.	Tiako ho faly izy ireo.
But there is a small problem.	Saingy misy olana kely.
Things in the other house.	Ny zavatra ao an-trano hafa.
Certainly not me.	Tena tsy izaho mihitsy.
He loves both of them.	Samy tiany izy roa.
A man with him did not ask.	Nisy lehilahy iray niaraka taminy tsy nanontany.
Then here’s the next one.	Dia ity ny manaraka.
I have read this book.	Efa namaky io boky io aho.
Some have it, some don’t.	Misy manana izany, misy tsy manana.
They just went out and did what they wanted.	Nivoaka fotsiny izy ireo ary nanao izay tiany.
They do not know.	Tsy fantany ireo.
So, we decided he should learn to swim.	Noho izany, nanapa-kevitra izahay fa tokony hianatra milomano izy.
Of course they do.	Mazava ho azy fa manao izany izy ireo.
You do two things.	Manao zavatra roa ianao.
He’s not done yet.	Mbola tsy vita izy.
No, you don’t have to work.	Tsia, tsy mila miasa ianao.
Then you talk to him.	Dia miresaka aminy ianao.
He was still looking at me.	Mbola nijery ahy foana izy.
It doesn't seem right.	Toa tsy mety izany.
For many years.	Nandritra ny taona maro.
This is often true but not always true.	Marina izany matetika fa tsy foana.
It can be difficult.	Mety ho sarotra izany.
And first.	Ary aloha.
We will buy food, water, clothes for you.	Hividy sakafo, rano, akanjo ho anao izahay.
I've seen it before.	Efa nahita an'io aho.
I don’t even see what it is.	Tsy hitako akory hoe inona izany.
I really love you.	Tena tiako ianao.
That may be true.	Marina angamba izany.
That is the only time.	Izay ihany no fotoana.
He also had more.	Nanana bebe kokoa koa izy.
At some point, people no longer ask.	Amin'ny fotoana iray dia tsy manontany intsony ny olona.
I have to know.	Tsy maintsy fantatro.
Well, don’t think about the latter.	Eny ary, aza mieritreritra izay farany.
I don’t expect to be that kind of person.	Tsy manantena ny ho toy izany olona izany aho.
Maybe not for you but for me.	Mety tsy ho anao fa ho ahy.
A woman was with him.	Nisy vehivavy niaraka taminy.
Water and ready to water.	Rano ary vonona amin'ny rano.
You said it yourself.	Ianao mihitsy no nilaza izany.
They look at you.	Mijery anao izy ireo.
I will return to him.	hiverina aminy aho.
He will never do it again.	Tsy hanao izany intsony izy.
He wanted to learn.	Naniry hianatra izy.
That's better.	Tsara kokoa izany.
Not much to ask.	Tsy dia be ny manontany.
And why don’t they do it.	Ary nahoana izy ireo no tsy manao izany.
This is the worst kind.	Izany no karazana ratsy indrindra.
There will be no rain today.	Tsy hisy orana anio.
And it’s not easy.	Ary tsy mora izany.
We must hope.	Tsy maintsy manantena isika.
And he got it.	Ary azony izany.
I'm busy.	Sahirana aho.
He was still thinking hard.	Mbola nieritreritra mafy izy.
The truth is he likes it.	Ny marina dia tiany izany.
It’s not done until it’s done.	Tsy vita raha tsy efa vita.
And he went out.	Dia nivoaka izy.

I was surprised to see him.	Gaga aho nahita azy.
He came out.	Nivoaka izy.
I’m not afraid things aren’t going well.	Tsy matahotra mihitsy aho fa tsy mandeha ny zavatra.

Women love things like that.	Ny vehivavy dia tia zavatra toy izany.
We are very close to him.	Tena akaiky azy izahay.
If so.	Raha misy izany.
It doesn’t matter to me anyway.	Tsy maninona amiko izany na izany na tsy izany.
I'm just doing work.	Manao asa fotsiny aho.
He was very scared.	Tena natahotra izy.
He knew something was wrong but didn’t know what it was.	Fantany fa nisy zavatra tsy nety nefa tsy fantany hoe inona izany.
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
He was used to it.	Efa zatra izany izy.
Maybe once.	Angamba indray mandeha.
We will not go back there.	Tsy hiverina any izahay.
She was glad he asked.	Faly izy fa nanontany izy.
The story is as follows.	Toy izao manaraka izao ny tantara.
It was a completely different person.	Olona hafa tanteraka ilay izy.
I often ignore that.	Matetika aho no tsy miraharaha an'izany.
Those who are here are here.	Ireo izay eto dia eto.
That shouldn’t have been said.	Tsy tokony ho nilaza izany.
No one did.	Tsy nisy nanao izany.

It's raining.	Avy ny orana.
A lot of things could go wrong.	Betsaka ny zavatra mety tsy nety.

This is difficult.	Sarotra ity.
They are not lucky.	Tsy tsara vintana izy ireo.
No need now.	Tsy mila izao.
We don’t need to say more than that.	Tsy mila miteny mihoatra izany isika.

There were problems, but far away.	Teo ny olana, saingy lavitra.
But no one says anything.	Saingy tsy misy miteny na inona na inona.
It's okay too.	Mety koa.
I am with you on that.	Miaraka aminao amin'izany aho.

Why he is.	Nahoana no izy.
I am still like that.	Mbola toy izany foana aho.
It wasn’t the history that did it but the music.	Tsy ny tantara no nanao izany fa ny mozika.

So why did you do that? 	Koa nahoana ianao no nanao izany?

Talk and talk.	Miresaka sy miresaka.
We're not going to get into that.	Tsy hiditra amin’izany isika.
But he kept talking.	Saingy niteny ihany izy.
And, that’s a good fit.	Ary, mety tsara izany.
However, I think it is a very important thing.	Na izany aza, heveriko fa zavatra tena ilaina tokoa izany.

He had a problem.	Nanana olana izy.

Why not?	Fa nahoana no tsy?
Anyway, it doesn’t matter.	Na ahoana na ahoana, tsy maninona izany.
There is more to it than that.	Mbola misy mihoatra noho izany aza.
He will help me.	Hanampy ahy izy.
If he doesn’t say anything, let’s still find something to do.	Raha tsy miteny na inona na inona izy dia aleo mbola mitady zavatra hatao.

He’s just trying to help.	Miezaka manampy fotsiny izy.
I often think of music.	Matetika aho no mieritreritra amin'ny mozika.
We will be with him after that.	Hiaraka aminy izahay rehefa afaka izany.
The patient died.	Maty ilay marary.
So nothing came of it.	Ka tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga tamin’izany.
This is a bit more complicated.	Izany dia somary sarotra kokoa.
I have no friends.	Tsy manana namana aho.
I live here.	Mipetraka eto aho.
Both didn’t work for me.	Samy tsy niasa tamiko.
I should be with you.	Izaho no tokony hiaraka aminao.
It is very powerful.	Tena mahery izy io.
That will be a problem.	Ho olana izany.
It’s a completely new approach.	Fomba vaovao tanteraka izany.
It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona izany.
I don't know what happened.	Tsy fantatro izay nitranga.
You know it, even if you think you don’t.	Fantatrao izany, na dia heverinao fa tsy manao izany ianao.
But remain confused.	Fa mijanona ho very hevitra.
There will never be a better time.	Tsy hisy fotoana tsara kokoa.
And what is it.	Ary inona izany.
Story after story.	Tantara manaraka tantara.
Just like last week.	Toy ny tamin’ny herinandro lasa.
Good stuff.	Zavatra tsara.
To me personally.	Amiko mihitsy.
But you do it.	Fa ianao no manao izany.
And in a few places that was true.	Ary tany amin'ny toerana vitsivitsy dia marina izany.
I won’t tell anyone anything.	Tsy hilaza na iza na iza na inona na inona.
No one needs money like that.	Tsy misy olona mila vola toy izany.
And he was alive.	Dia velona izy.
Why do you think otherwise.	Nahoana ianao no mieritreritra zavatra hafa.
You are not like me.	Tsy mitovy amiko ianao.
A lot of money.	Vola be.
It was there.	Teo izy io.
If it’s not, it’s someone else.	Raha tsy izy io dia olona hafa.
The children were playing.	Nilalao ny ankizy.
And then we.	Ary avy eo izahay.
It was a wonderful week.	Herinandro nahafinaritra izany.
But it's not.	Saingy tsy izany.
What he lost.	Izay very taminy.
He was just a man.	Lehilahy fotsiny izy.
So that’s all.	Dia izany no zava-drehetra.
There may be a problem with the paper.	Mety misy olana amin'ny taratasy.
That's what happened.	Izany no nitranga.
I looked immediately.	Nijery avy hatrany aho.
I think the time must come for them.	Heveriko fa tsy maintsy tonga ny fotoana ho azy ireo.
But it’s not very good.	Saingy tsy dia tsara loatra izany.
I see it today.	Hitako izany amin'izao andro izao.
Someone wants to hurt you.	Misy olona te hanao anao ho ratsy.
He is thirty years old.	Telopolo taona izy.
Now you will be free.	Ankehitriny dia ho afaka ianao.
These ideas go far beyond them.	Mihoatra lavitra azy ireo hevitra ireo.
You can do it anywhere.	Azonao atao izany na aiza na aiza.
You have to do something.	Tokony hanao zavatra ianao.
It seems very likely to be real.	Toa tena mety ho tena izy io.
He told us.	Nilaza taminay izy.
No one saw him.	Tsy nisy nahita azy.
It’s almost all.	Saika ny rehetra izany.
We never thought of any other ideas.	Tsy nieritreritra hevitra hafa mihitsy izahay.
She seems really worried.	Toa manahy tokoa izy.
He walked fast.	Nandeha haingana izy.
The bad and the good.	Ny ratsy sy ny tsara.
You have to be able to see it.	Tsy maintsy afaka mahita izany ianao.
I could be crazy.	Mety ho adala aho.
As long as you eat and get enough sleep.	Raha mbola mihinana sy matory ampy.
And now it is here.	Ary izao dia teto.
She’s beautiful, really, but it’s not.	Tsara tarehy izy, tena marina, saingy tsy izany.
The present is back.	Niverina ny ankehitriny.
This is wrong because it is not true.	Diso izany satria tsy marina.
I felt good.	Nahatsiaro tena ho tsara aho.
I’m really into something here.	Tena ao anatin'ny zavatra iray aho eto.
It works well too.	Miasa tsara koa.
There are a few others known.	Misy vitsivitsy hafa fantatra.
Yes, but he didn't.	Eny, saingy tsy nanao izany izy.
And there is work to be done.	Ary misy asa tokony hatao.
And not just one, many.	Ary tsy iray ihany, maro.
The same is true in other ways.	Toy izany koa ny fomba hafa.
That is the problem.	Izany no olana.
Both were not there.	Samy tsy nisy teo.
I still find it really fun and challenging.	Mbola hitako fa tena mahafinaritra sy sarotra izany.
I had to read it.	Tsy maintsy namaky azy io.
These are good things.	Zavatra tsara ireo.
I still don't quite understand why.	Mbola tsy azoko tsara ny antony.
I should have said ‘no’ to him.	Tokony ho niteny 'tsia' taminy aho.
Maybe they can help.	Angamba afaka manampy izy ireo.
I asked him what it was.	Nanontany azy aho hoe inona izany.
She had never seen him so ugly.	Mbola tsy nahita azy ratsy tarehy toy izany izy.
He seems to be a good person.	Toa olona tsara izy.
But he was very interested.	Fa tena liana tokoa izy.
I'm really bad.	Tena ratsy aho.
They will look at me.	Hijery ahy izy ireo.
I know him.	Mahafantatra azy aho.
Nothing else.	Tsy misy hafa.
He was probably right.	Tena marina angamba izy.
But, one day, it will happen.	Saingy, indray andro any, dia hisy izany.
One of these types.	Iray amin'ireo karazana ireo.
But he knew he had to stay home.	Saingy fantany fa tokony hijanona ao an-trano izy.
It’s really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra azy.
You always try to do the right thing.	Miezaka manao ny tsara foana ianao.
He never understood it, not a word.	Tsy azony mihitsy izany, na dia teny iray aza.
They were the only ones who asked him to bring it.	Izy ireo ihany no nangataka azy hitondra izany.
I had to work.	Tsy maintsy niasa aho.
It is very difficult to make money.	Tena sarotra ny mitady vola.
I thought he was completely happy.	Noheveriko fa faly tanteraka izy.
Little people apologize.	Olona kely miala tsiny.
The place was there too.	Teo koa ilay toerana.
I am trying to find another job.	Miezaka mitady asa hafa aho.
There was no night.	Tsy nisy alina.
I work for good people.	Miasa ho an'ny olona tsara aho.
All your ideas are correct.	Marina ny hevitrao rehetra.
You don't even know him.	Tsy fantatrao akory izy.
This is not wrong.	Tsy diso izany.
Really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra.
He himself drinks the water.	Izy mihitsy no misotro ny rano.
We need to get out of here, get away.	Mila miala eto isika, lasa lavitra.
It could be me too.	Mety ho izaho koa izany.
He was very nice to me.	Tena tsara tamiko izy.
And he knew it was true.	Ary fantany fa marina izany.
Now, of course he will say that.	Ankehitriny, mazava ho azy fa hilaza izany izy.
He doesn't apologize.	Tsy miala tsiny izy.
A troubled woman.	Vehivavy sahirana.
If you are alive.	Raha velona ianao.
Oh really?	Marina ve izany?
He alone.	Izy ihany.
I will not go with him.	Tsy handeha hiaraka aminy aho.
But everywhere.	Saingy eny rehetra eny.
He did not come.	Tsy tonga izy.
We might just be lucky.	Mety ho tsara vintana ihany isika.
Words like fools.	Ireo teny toy ny adala.
Don’t talk to him, right.	Tsy miresaka aminy, marina.
Today is the day to have dinner.	Androany no tokony hatao ny sakafo hariva.
But for good reason.	Fa tsara ny antony.
He didn't think much of her.	Tsy dia nieritreritra azy loatra izy.
He was able to walk.	Afaka nandeha izy.
This one could be higher than that.	Ity iray ity dia mety ho ambony noho izany.
If you get the chance to do that, you should.	Raha mahazo ny fahafahana hanao izany ianao dia tokony.
He got it.	Nahazo izy.
He’s just trying to do the right thing.	Miezaka manao ny tsara fotsiny izy.

Anyway, you know me.	Na izany na tsy izany, fantatrao aho.

It’s as bad as it should be.	Ratsy araka ny tokony ho izy izany.
Both spent the day.	Samy nandany ny andro.
I just go through the books.	Mandeha ao anaty boky fotsiny aho.
Because everything is better than that.	Satria ny zavatra rehetra dia tsara noho izany.
Of those who work.	Amin'ireo miasa.
At the worst possible time.	Amin'ny fotoana ratsy indrindra.
They did not ask him about his past or himself.	Tsy nanontany azy momba ny lasa na ny tenany izy ireo.

Good day.	Andro tsara.
What time is it?	Amin'ny firy izao?

If not, say so.	Raha tsy izany dia lazao izany.
We were able to go with him.	Afaka nandeha niaraka taminy izahay.
Soon it won’t be enough.	Tsy ho ela dia tsy ho ampy izany.
But of course as time goes on, he has it.	Saingy mazava ho azy rehefa mandeha ny fotoana, dia manana izany izy.
So we were completely alone.	Noho izany dia irery tanteraka izahay.
But anyone can do it easily.	Fa na iza na iza afaka manao mora.
I do nothing.	Tsy misy ataoko.
And it can’t be any other way for you.	Ary tsy mety ho fomba hafa ho anao izany.
Not the words at all, but close.	Tsy ny teny mihitsy, fa akaiky.
He should have been able to help.	Tokony ho afaka nanampy izy.

Maybe he should tell the room.	Angamba tokony hilaza ny efitrano izy.

Then he said it would come.	Avy eo dia nilaza izy fa ho avy.
If they’re big, that’s it.	Raha lehibe izy ireo dia izay.
Others, have a place.	Ny hafa, manana toerana.
Many need food.	Betsaka ny mila sakafo.
Maybe next time.	Amin'ny manaraka angamba.
That’s where the story began.	Teo no nanomboka ny tantara.
I already had enough.	Efa nanana ny ampy aho.
They heard it.	Nandre izany izy ireo.
Both go well.	Samy mandeha tsara.
I know what you mean.	Fantatro ny hevitrao.
It’s hard to imagine now.	Sarotra ny mieritreritra izao.
Because of him.	Noho izy.
I'm not going home.	Tsy mody aho.
You should never come back here.	Tsy tokony hiverina eto mihitsy ianao.
However, it is not easy.	Na izany aza dia tsy mora.

He said he would come tomorrow.	Nilaza izy fa ho avy rahampitso.
He did not spend a day at home.	Tsy nandany andro iray tao an-trano izy.
Or make dinner.	Na manao sakafo hariva.

He could hope again tomorrow.	Afaka nanantena indray izy rahampitso.
Very good.	Tena tsara.
And maybe he thought.	Ary angamba nieritreritra izy.
These words are very true.	Tena marina ireo teny ireo.
For the morning.	Ho an'ny maraina.
But we.	Fa izahay.
Who knows where he came from?	Iza no mahalala hoe avy aiza izy?
Because yes, you are right.	Satria eny, marina ny anao.
Live or die.	Velona na maty.
But not the child.	Fa tsy ilay zaza.
Probably the only good one.	Angamba ny tsara ihany.
I can't talk about it tonight.	Tsy afaka miresaka izany aho anio alina.
We discussed two issues.	Niresaka olana roa izahay.

The question, of course, is when.	Ny fanontaniana, mazava ho azy, dia rahoviana.

It’s hard to believe he’s not here.	Sarotra ny mino fa tsy eto izy.
But it’s not entirely safe.	Saingy tsy azo antoka tanteraka.
How long did you last meet?	Hafiriana no nihaona farany?
I want to know if anything is missing from me.	Tiako ho fantatra raha misy zavatra tsy ampy ahy.

Maybe he was wrong.	Angamba diso izy.
I can't anymore.	Tsy afaka intsony aho.
Good party.	Fety tsara.
He came to me.	Tonga tamiko izy.
And maybe he’s not really lost.	Ary angamba tsy tena very izy.
He is not really sick.	Tsy tena marary izy.
You have said that before.	Efa nilaza izany ianao taloha.
There is no place like home.	Tsy misy toerana toy ny trano.
A little bit is gone.	Kely kely no lasa.
He is very different.	Tena hafa mihitsy izy.
Or maybe just let it go.	Na mety avela fotsiny.
It is not clear what happened next.	Tsy dia mazava loatra ny zava-nitranga manaraka.

He drove and drove.	Nandeha fiara izy ary nitondra fiara.

Every man knows this.	Fantatry ny lehilahy rehetra izany.
There are only two ways.	Misy fomba roa ihany.
I came to the story.	Tonga tamin'ny tantara aho.
Then tried again.	Dia nanandrana indray.
I don't understand.	Tsy azoko.
I saw him enter the house.	Hitako niditra tao amin’ilay trano izy.
And now we seem to be there.	Ary amin'izao fotoana izao dia toa eo isika.

If we are here, we are here.	Raha eto isika dia eto.
I was wrong.	Diso hevitra aho.
He now felt better at home.	Nahatsiaro ho tsara kokoa izy izao rehefa tao an-trano.
It is a book of ideas.	Izy io kosa dia boky misy hevitra.
He came out.	Nivoaka izy.
Or worse, you have to look at the ground.	Na ratsy kokoa, tsy maintsy mijery ny tany.
Not night or day.	Tsy alina na andro.
This is the real problem.	Io no tena olana.
But he got nothing.	Nefa tsy nahazo na inona na inona izy.
This is true of money.	Izany no marina amin'ny vola.
Although not all of them.	Na dia tsy izy rehetra aza.
Such a car.	Fiara toy izany.

We are walking in the right direction.	Mandeha amin'ny lalana marina isika.

See if anyone knows.	Nijery raha nisy olona fantany.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Mety indray andro any, fa tsy mbola.

I'm afraid that's the problem.	Matahotra aho fa izay no olana.
So, that’s all that’s needed, really.	Noho izany, izay ihany no ilaina, tena.

You know you like it.	Fantatrao fa tianao izany.
Not enough time.	Tsy ampy ny fotoana.
They will do other things there.	Hanao zavatra hafa izy ireo any.

I just love it.	Tiako fotsiny ilay izy.
I will not do that.	Tsy hanao izany aho.

I don't see why.	Tsy hitako ny antony.
At that time, there was still nothing.	Tamin'izany fotoana izany dia mbola tsy nisy na inona na inona.
I think it was really music.	Heveriko fa tena mozika tokoa ilay izy.
We will not talk about that now.	Tsy hiresaka momba izany isika izao.
I was a student there.	Mpianatra tao aho.
He arrived a little early.	Tonga aloha kely izy.

I saw them right away.	Hitako avy hatrany izy ireo.
Both have them.	Samy manana azy ireo.
These are not for me.	Tsy misy ahy ireo.
The music went on, but the room was empty.	Nandeha ny mozika, saingy foana ny efitrano.
It may have gone too far.	Mety ho lasa lavitra loatra.

Maybe if he just told her.	Angamba raha nilaza taminy fotsiny izy.
Of course, there was no such thing.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy toy izany.
But they didn’t play like us.	Saingy tsy nilalao tahaka antsika izy ireo.
But he was still there.	Saingy teo ihany izy.
Now is the time to do it.	Fotoana hanaovana izany izao.
I have a lot of time.	Manana fotoana betsaka aho.
Next place we were lucky.	Ny toerana manaraka dia tsara vintana izahay.
Will definitely be back.	Tena hiverina.
She often worked for men.	Matetika izy no niasa ho an'ny lehilahy.
But my teacher was definitely right about one thing.	Saingy azo antoka fa marina ny zavatra iray ny mpampianatra ahy.
Sure, people talk a lot.	Azo antoka fa miresaka betsaka ny olona.
He doesn't speak either.	Tsy miteny koa izy.
She is ready for that.	Efa vonona amin’izany izy.
That should be all.	Tokony ho izany rehetra izany.
Everything else today will be talked about.	Ny zavatra hafa rehetra anio dia hiresaka momba azy.
Who knows what happened.	Iza no mahalala ny zava-nitranga.
I want to help him.	Te hanampy azy aho.
He should be home now.	Tokony ho ao an-trano izy izao.
I and others have said this before.	Izaho sy ny hafa dia efa nilaza izany taloha.
For the time to come.	Ho an'ny fotoana ho avy.
He pretended to be asleep.	Mody natory izy.
They really help.	Manampy tokoa izy ireo.
Every day.	Isan'andro isan'andro.
I knew he was free.	Fantatro fa afaka izy.
Yes, he will.	Eny, hanao izany izy.
We will never have enough food.	Tsy ho ampy sakafo mihitsy izahay.
We can't go anywhere today.	Tsy afaka mandeha na aiza na aiza isika androany.
That's right.	Izany tokoa.
He has no friends here.	Tsy manana namana izy eto.
You seem to be done with the right thing.	Toa vita tamin'ny zavatra mety ianao.
Is it too fast ?.	Haingana loatra ve izany?.
I see the problem.	Hitako ny olana.
I'm sure of that.	Azoko antoka izany.
He alone will do it.	Izy irery no hanao izany.
Very good indeed.	Tena tsara tokoa.
Often, the best path is not the clearest.	Matetika, ny lalana tsara indrindra dia tsy ny mazava indrindra.
Really, really good.	Tena, tena tsara.
He prefers that approach.	Tiany kokoa izany fomba izany.
He didn't want to leave.	Tsy te hiala izy.
Or maybe next year.	Na mety ny taona manaraka izany.
But it doesn’t take more than a minute.	Saingy tsy ilaina ny mihoatra ny minitra.
Only a few words are needed.	Teny kely vitsivitsy ihany no ilaina.
Why him? 	Nahoana izy?
Admittedly, it’s really fun.	Marina fa tena mahafinaritra izany.
What good news!	Vaovao mahafinaritra tokoa!
Known and new.	Fantatra sy vaovao.
You are good.	Tsara ianao.
I'll find one.	Hahita iray aho.
There is no such chance yet.	Mbola tsy misy vintana toy izany.
Don’t eat too much!	Aza mihinana be loatra!
No, that's better.	Tsia, tsara kokoa izany.
He was asleep.	Natory izy.
It will be great.	Ho lehibe izany.
They don’t have to worry about him anymore.	Tsy mila manahy momba azy intsony izy ireo.
But nothing seems to work.	Saingy toa tsy misy miasa.
I don't know what happened.	Tsy fantatro izay nitranga.
We will do it though.	Hanao izany izahay na izany aza.
He talks about it.	Miresaka momba izany izy.
I usually do that.	Matetika aho no manao izany.
It was still asleep.	Natory ihany ilay izy.
In fact though, it’s not very clear.	Raha ny marina na dia tsy dia mazava loatra aza izany.
The water is gone.	Lasa ny rano.
I can't seem to stop.	Toa tsy afaka mijanona aho.
He did not say why.	Tsy nilaza ny antony izy.
I really thank him.	Tena misaotra azy aho.
No, you shouldn't.	Tsia, tsy tokony.
They are very fast asleep.	Tena renoky ny torimaso izy ireo.
It was probably in the car.	Tao anaty fiara angamba ilay izy.
They have opportunities.	Manana fahafahana izy ireo.
Once again, we have this problem.	Indray mandeha indray dia manana ity olana ity isika.
It works really well there.	Tena miasa tsara any.
No, that's wrong.	Tsia, diso izany.
It’s looking for a job.	Mitady asa izany.
The elderly woman seemed puzzled.	Toa very hevitra ilay vehivavy be taona.
That's how men are.	Toy izany ny lehilahy.
Two, maybe three years at most.	Roa, mety telo taona raha be indrindra.
I hope to talk to you again soon.	Manantena ny hiresaka aminao indray aho tsy ho ela.
I’m not too angry right now.	Tsy dia tezitra loatra aho amin'izao fotoana izao.
The night is hard.	Mafy ny alina.
No words came out overnight.	Tsy nisy teny nivoaka nandritra ny alina.
Not two, not three.	Tsy roa, tsy telo.
The man was very lucky.	Tena tsara vintana ilay lehilahy.
I can't find it.	tsy hitako.
It is looking for a good home.	Mitady trano tsara izy io.
And a lot of people are lost in it.	Ary betsaka ny olona very amin'izany.
We will get it.	Hahazo azy isika.
All the other ideas, and that’s it.	Ny hevitra hafa rehetra, ary izany.
Even if they say they are ready, they have to be really ready.	Na dia milaza aza izy ireo fa vonona, dia tsy maintsy tena vonona.
He wished he couldn't do it.	Naniry izy fa tsy afaka nanao izany.
He watched the children play.	Nijery ny ankizy nilalao izy.
In fact, it was really good, went back to looking at them again.	Raha ny marina dia tena tsara, niverina nijery azy ireo indray.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.
I don't even remember being on the ground.	Tsy tadidiko akory hoe teo amin’ny tany aho.
It didn’t have to.	Tsy nanana izany.
They brought it.	Izy ireo no nitondra izany.
Not in a week, not in a day, now.	Tsy amin'ny herinandro, tsy amin'ny andro, ankehitriny.
You wondered why you didn’t see anyone else.	Nanontany tena ianao hoe nahoana ianao no tsy nahita hafa.
I got a house.	Nahazo trano aho.
One reason is because we don’t need it.	Ny antony iray dia satria tsy mila izany isika.
But it’s really good.	Saingy tena tsara tokoa izany.
Maybe just me.	Izaho ihany angamba.
It's not far from me.	Tsy lavitra ahy izany.
A lot of people say they played themselves.	Betsaka ny olona milaza fa nilalao ny tenany.
It was really fun to write.	Tena nahafinaritra ny nanoratra.
Not a woman looking away.	Tsy vehivavy mijery lavitra.

And you have no reason.	Ary tsy manana antony ianao.
He's your friend too, you know.	Namana anao koa izy, fantatrao.
This type of movie takes you somewhere else.	Ny karazana sarimihetsika dia mitondra anao any amin'ny toerana hafa.
Like fate.	Toy ny lahatra.
I don't know anyone here.	Tsy mahalala olona eto aho.
She really loves him.	Tena tiany izy.
It will not be easy.	Tsy ho mora izany.
And it shouldn’t be there.	Ary tsy tokony ho any.
You will leave this house, and you will never return.	Hiala amin’ity trano ity ianao, ary tsy hiverina intsony.
I still remember it well.	Mbola tadidiko tsara ilay izy.
I don’t understand why he was scared.	Tsy azoko hoe nahoana izy no natahotra.
This one is bigger.	Ity iray ity dia lehibe kokoa.
They really did.	Tena nanao izany izy ireo.
And we really are.	Ary tena izany tokoa isika.
I should have known that they would see me again.	Tokony ho fantatro fa hahita ahy indray izy ireo.
Adala.	Adala.
A hard -working man.	Lehilahy iray miasa mafy.
I never had to do that.	Tsy voatery nanao izany mihitsy aho.
We played well with it.	Nilalao tsara tamin’izany izahay.
In the big picture, there is none.	Amin'ny sary lehibe dia tsy misy mihitsy.
He will never return to her.	Tsy hiverina aminy intsony izy.
I'm confused here.	Very hevitra aho eto.
Something came back.	Nisy zavatra niverina.
You wanted it.	Ianao no naniry azy.
I knew it would be small.	Fantatro fa ho kely ilay izy.
We thought that was a very difficult question.	Nihevitra izahay fa fanontaniana sarotra be izany.
He returned.	Niverina izy.
No one wanted him.	Tsy nisy naniry azy.
We tried it.	Nanandrana izany izahay.
Not enough at all.	Tsy ampy mihitsy.
She was waiting for him.	Niandry azy izy.

Of course, he would never meet her.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy hihaona aminy mihitsy izy.

He went very fast.	Nandeha haingana be izy.
He knew it was true.	Fantany fa marina izany.
And it was very difficult for me.	Ary tena sarotra tamiko izany.
Because you know it’s clear that we got money.	Satria fantatrao fa mazava fa nahazo vola izahay.
This is important for two reasons.	Tena ilaina izany, noho ny antony roa.
I’m not sure if that will happen.	Tsy azoko antoka raha hisy izany.
We don’t do that right now.	Tsy manao izany izahay amin'izao fotoana izao.
Maybe he is for you.	Mety ho anao angamba izy.
Especially now, because you’re never here.	Indrindra fa amin'izao fotoana izao, satria tsy eto mihitsy ianao.
He wants to talk to you.	Te hiresaka aminao izy.
I'm not crazy.	Tsy adala aho.

All children can speak.	Afaka miteny ny ankizy rehetra.
I like this.	Tiako ity.
Otherwise it will be.	Raha tsy izany dia ho.
Today there was a big, big mistake.	Androany dia nisy fahadisoana, lehibe.
I came here right away.	Tonga teto avy hatrany aho.
I want to help him right away.	Te hanampy azy avy hatrany aho.
I don’t think it’s all perfect.	Tsy heveriko fa tanteraka daholo.
The land was beautiful.	Tena nahafinaritra ny tany.
These men worked hard.	Niasa mafy ireo lehilahy ireo.
He was outside.	Tany ivelany izy.

I think that’s a really good thing.	Heveriko fa zavatra tena tsara izany.
She became very beautiful.	Lasa tena tsara tarehy izy.

However, it doesn’t matter.	Na izany aza, tsy maninona.
Anyone has the same problem.	Na iza na iza manana olana mitovy.
We are very happy.	Faly be izahay.
Don’t worry you’ll get it.	Aza manahy fa ho azonao izany.
Didn't say anything the whole time.	Tsy niteny na inona na inona nandritra ny fotoana rehetra.
This one is not pretty.	Tsy tsara tarehy ity iray ity.
I know, I don’t either.	Fantatro, izaho koa tsy.
I don’t know how to do that.	Tsy haiko ny fomba hanaovana an'izany.
I wonder, can you come here.	Manontany tena aho, mety ho tonga eto ve ianao.
I was never sick of talking.	Tsy narary mihitsy aho niresaka.
He did it.	Nahavita izany izy.
However, the same is true.	Na izany aza, toy izany koa.
I do it perfectly.	Manao izany tanteraka aho.
If you know me, you know this story.	Raha fantatrao aho dia fantatrao ity tantara ity.
People talked to me.	Niresaka tamiko ny olona.
A week ago, he still hadn’t called.	Herinandro lasa izay dia mbola tsy niantso ihany izy.
He did it.	Nanao izany izy.
Not many have even tried it.	Tsy maro akory no nanandrana.
Everything is completely new.	Vaovao tanteraka ny zava-drehetra.
He was very sick.	Narary mafy izy.
It was done quickly.	Vita haingana izany.
I was afraid to say anything about what had happened.	Natahotra ny hilaza na inona na inona momba ny zava-nitranga aho.
He started there when he saw her.	Nanomboka teo izy rehefa nahita azy.
So everything became more alive to me.	Noho izany dia lasa velona kokoa amiko ny zava-drehetra.
That is no longer the problem.	Tsy izany intsony no olana.
And we just sat there.	Ary nipetraka teo fotsiny izahay.
So far away.	Any lavitra any.
You are wrong.	Diso hevitra ianao.
Apparently no one.	Toa tsy misy olona.
And he didn’t know if he had done the right thing.	Ary tsy fantany raha nanao ny tsara izy.
Why, we can do anything.	Nahoana, afaka manao na inona na inona isika.
I thought maybe.	Nieritreritra aho angamba.
He used to think of himself as a person.	Nieritreritra ny tenany ho olona izy taloha.
You can think of me though.	Afaka mieritreritra ahy ianao na izany aza.
There are many ideas out there.	Misy hevitra maro any.
Let's get there soon.	Aleo tonga haingana.
Both will go.	Samy handeha izy roa.
We must have help.	Tsy maintsy manana fanampiana isika.
The past few days have been a month.	Ny andro vitsivitsy lasa iray volana.
Which of these, it’s hard to say.	Iza amin'ireo, sarotra ny milaza.
He wants to leave now.	Te hiala izy izao.
I don't doubt you.	Tsy misalasala anao aho.
The child refused.	Tsy nety ilay zaza.
You therefore.	Ianao noho izany.
So that’s a good idea.	Ka hevitra tsara izany.
It is not known why.	Tsy fantatra hoe nahoana.
The house is very bad.	Ratsy be ny trano.
He may actually be asleep.	Mbola matory angamba izy raha ny marina.
He looks very angry.	Toa tezitra be izy.
I didn’t think so.	Tsy nieritreritra izany aho.
But you get it right.	Fa azonao tsara.
You know how it was.	Fantatrao hoe nanao ahoana izany.
It was good to stay at home.	Tsara ny nijanona tao an-trano.
Very powerful words.	Teny mahery tokoa.
We are just scared.	Matahotra fotsiny izahay.
Then walked a little back.	Dia nandeha kely niverina.
I was so happy to be here, felt great.	Tena faly aho tonga teto, nahatsiaro tsara.
But either way, something will be lost.	Saingy na izany na tsy izany dia hisy zavatra ho very.
You are you.	Ianao dia ianao.
They started.	Nanomboka izy ireo.
I really am.	Izaho tokoa.
I can think of a way.	Afaka mieritreritra fomba iray aho.
But here is a bigger problem.	Saingy eto dia misy olana lehibe kokoa.
They were fun.	Nahafinaritra izy ireo.
He came to me.	Tonga tamiko izy.
He was always there for us.	Teo foana ho anay izy.
I wonder how old he is.	Manontany tena aho hoe firy taona izy.
The reason for this is still unknown.	Mbola tsy fantatra ny antony nahatonga izany.
You will soon find out.	Tsy ho ela dia ho fantatrao izany.
Just a little bit.	Somary kely fotsiny.
The same is true here.	Toy izany koa ny eto.
I tried to help.	Niezaka nanampy aho.
There was a door.	Nisy varavarana iray.
I hope it gets better.	Manantena aho fa tsara kokoa izany.
No, that's right.	Tsia, marina izany.
They can do whatever they want.	Afaka manao izay tiany izy ireo.
I know it’s not easy.	Fantatro fa tsy mora izany.
He read a book with him.	Namaky ilay boky iray niaraka taminy izy.
They came here.	Tonga eto izy ireo.
Went to see him too.	Nandeha nijery azy koa.
I need to see this man.	Mila mahita an'io lehilahy io aho.
Yes, it is very possible.	Eny, tena azo atao izany.
He had never spent a night outside before.	Mbola tsy nandany ny alina tany ivelany izy taloha.
Which is obviously who these two people are.	Izay mazava ho azy fa iza ireo olona roa ireo.
The car is helpful but not necessary.	Ny fiara dia manampy fa tsy ilaina.
He had to be there.	Tsy maintsy teo izy.
You can't do that.	Tsy mahazo manao izany ianao.
I will take you home.	Izaho no hitondra anao hody.
He thought during the trip.	Nihevitra izy nandritra ny dia.
He was very accomplished.	Tena nahavita be izy.
The good news is that he could have done the same.	Ny vaovao tsara dia hoe afaka nanao toy izany koa izy.
If you think of one thing more than anything else, you are doing wrong.	Raha mihevitra zavatra mihoatra noho ny zavatra hafa ianao dia manao ratsy.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra ilay izy.
I may help with that over time.	Mety hanampy izany aho rehefa mandeha ny fotoana.
Hope to see him again.	Manantena ny hahita azy indray.
Some of it, actually.	Somary amin'izany, raha ny marina.
He said he knew.	Nilaza izy fa fantany.
Not that you care.	Tsy hoe miraharaha ianao.
It didn't happen.	Tsy nitranga izany.
However, as time went on, no one heard anything more.	Na izany aza, rehefa nandeha ny fotoana, dia tsy nisy nandre na inona na inona intsony.
But it doesn’t do it nearly as well.	Saingy tsy manao izany saika araka ny tokony ho izy.
We were alone in the room.	Irery izahay tao amin’ilay efitrano.
I'm alone.	Izaho irery.
Then they do.	Dia manao izany izy ireo.
You are here now.	Eto ianao izao.
I hope you can help.	Manantena aho fa afaka manampy ianao.
But here you are, not going home.	Fa eto ianao, tsy hody.
We just have to go.	Mila mandeha ihany isika.
Two men were killed.	Lehilahy roa no maty.
I will come tomorrow evening.	Ho avy aho rahampitso hariva.
Who loves water?	Iza no tia rano?
The two of us alone.	Izahay roa irery.
It didn't happen.	Tsy nitranga izany.
He studied hard.	Nianatra mafy izy.
This is very true.	Tena marina tokoa izany.
And we don’t need a problem.	Ary tsy mila olana isika.
I don't have a car.	Tsy manana fiara aho.
He never wasted any time.	Tsy nandany fotoana mihitsy.
There is no end to it.	Tsy misy farany izany.
He needed to be with her, to help her.	Nila niaraka taminy izy, mba hanampy azy.
And this is the same thing.	Ary ity dia zavatra mitovy.
We work hard.	Miasa mafy izahay.
Everything went well.	Nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
He really wanted it.	Tena naniry izany izy.
I like to eat it in two ways.	Tiako ny mihinana azy amin'ny fomba roa.
Work that I did.	Asa izay nataoko.
They are good too.	Tsara ihany koa izy ireo.
You need them.	Mila azy ireo ianao.
Such is the case today.	Toy izany ny amin'izao fotoana izao.
Sure, there must be something.	Azo antoka fa tsy maintsy misy zavatra.
Still going, too.	Mbola mandeha koa.
And that's how it should be.	Ary izany no tokony ho izany.
This is good.	Tsara ny izao.
It is now.	Izy io izao.
I enjoy doing things.	Mahafinaritra ahy ny manao zavatra.
He had work to do.	Nanana asa tokony hatao izy.
He left too.	Lasa koa izy.
I thought we were going to have a little party.	Nihevitra aho fa hanao fety kely izahay.
The same was true during the afternoon.	Toy izany koa nandritra ny tolakandro.
And nothing else.	Ary tsy misy hafa.
He wants to stay outside.	Te hijanona any ivelany izy.
But I'm not the one who's lost.	Fa tsy izaho izay very teny.
He was not at all surprised.	Tsy gaga mihitsy izy.
I don’t want to see him do that.	Tsy tiako ny hahita azy manao izany.
He just had it.	Vao avy nanana izany izy.
That is not enough.	Tsy ampy izany.
From there we said.	Niala tao izahay nilaza.
The children came here.	Tonga eto ny ankizy.
I don't know what to do.	Tsy hitako izay hatao.
All the best.	Ny tsara rehetra.
No, you are not.	Tsia, tsy izany ianao.
The water now began to fill up quickly.	Nanomboka feno haingana ny rano ankehitriny.
He seems to have built a house.	Toa nanao trano izy.
Tomorrow is the last day for them.	Rahampitso no andro farany ho azy ireo.
It may work and it may not work.	Mety miasa izany ary mety tsy miasa.
They are still far away.	Mbola lavitra izy ireo.
I think he is too.	Heveriko fa izy koa.
You are outside.	Any ivelany ianao.
They will see you.	Hahita anao izy ireo.
It could be a very small thing.	Mety ho zavatra kely dia kely.
Not my type.	Tsy karazana ahy.
Not too good, but really bad.	Tsy dia tsara loatra, fa tena ratsy.
The years went by.	Nandeha ny taona.
I need to try harder.	Mila miezaka mafy kokoa aho.
It was as if he were someone else.	Toy ny hoe olona hafa izy izao.
We often waited for them.	Matetika izahay no niandry azy ireo.
Thank you so much for all the help.	Misaotra indrindra amin'ny fanampiana rehetra.
Now you know why.	Fantatrao izao ny antony.
We read books about travel.	Mamaky boky momba ny dia izahay.
It’s a beautiful picture.	Sary mahafinaritra izy io.
Everyone here is very close.	Tena akaiky ny olona rehetra eto.
He is very bad.	Tena ratsy izy.
He could have done it longer.	Afaka nanao izany lava kokoa izy.
It won’t get him.	Tsy hahazo azy izany.
In fact, like a fool.	Raha ny marina, toy ny adala.
I am a best friend.	Namana tsara indrindra aho.
He read a lot of books.	Namaky boky be dia be izy.
It’s just a job for him.	Asa ho azy ihany izany.
They come to you in two different ways.	Izy ireo dia tonga aminao amin'ny fomba roa samy hafa.
I want to see him.	Te hahita azy aho.
He didn't want to see it anymore.	Tsy te hahita izany intsony izy.
It really is.	Tena izy tokoa.
I asked the man driving the car about it.	Nanontany ilay lehilahy nitondra ny fiara aho momba izany.
All of us.	Ny antsika rehetra.
Like me.	Tahaka ny ahy.
And he had to do the right thing.	Ary tsy maintsy nanao ny marina.
But it's just us.	Fa isika ihany izany.
But we may not.	Saingy mety tsy isika.
There is a book about it.	Misy boky momba izany.
He is absolutely immortal.	Tena tsy mety maty izy.
That sounds good.	Toa tsara izany.
We've talked about that before.	Efa niresaka an’izany mihitsy izahay.
Days went by, then weeks.	Nandeha ny andro, avy eo herinandro.
He loves it.	Tiany izany.
He also acknowledged this.	Niaiky izany koa izy.
The good news is you don’t need it.	Ny vaovao tsara dia tsy mila izany ianao.
And that’s not the fun thing to do today.	Ary tsy izany no zavatra mahafinaritra atao amin'izao andro izao.
He might like it.	Mety ho tiany izany.
The man is a teacher.	Mpampianatra ilay lehilahy.
I really think it’s going to be great.	Tena heveriko fa ho lehibe izany.
Instead, he was interested, and interested.	Liana kosa izy, ary liana.
This is not a pretty picture.	Tsy sary tsara tarehy io.
There is nothing like it.	Tsy misy toa azy.
Or try.	Na miezaka.
She seems to love him too.	Toa tia azy koa izy.
That’s why he’s here.	Izany no nahatonga azy eto.
And he stopped.	Dia nijanona izy.
I think it’s different.	Heveriko fa hafa izany.
It was very small.	Kely tokoa ilay izy.
Or maybe this one.	Na angamba ity iray ity.
It was like being a child again.	Toy ny hoe zaza indray izany.
But playing too fast.	Fa milalao haingana loatra.
But you can’t think of something like that.	Saingy tsy afaka mieritreritra zavatra toy izany ianao.
He is a very big man.	Tena lehilahy lehibe izy.
You will be free.	Ho afaka ianao.
A man who decided to live.	Ny lehilahy iray izay nanapa-kevitra ny ho velona.
No and get away with it.	Tsia ary miala amin'izany.
Not even one person.	Tsy olona iray akory.
Men of the last days.	Lehilahy amin’ny andro farany.
The same is true everywhere.	Toy izany koa na aiza na aiza.
Just tell me.	Lazao ahy fotsiny.
There may still be a way.	Mety mbola misy fomba.
But you go first.	Fa ianao aloha no mandeha.
How was he	Nanao ahoana izy?
That’s a lot.	Betsaka izany.
He had to say something.	Tsy maintsy nilaza zavatra izy.
I haven't seen it yet.	Tsy mbola nahita izany.
Tell us so you can go home.	Lazao anay izany dia afaka mody ianao.
He made an appointment at two o'clock.	Nanao fotoana izy tamin’ny roa ora.
He did it himself as a child.	Izy mihitsy no nanao izany, fony mbola zaza.
I can't do anything about it.	Tsy afaka manao na inona na inona momba azy aho.
Very small.	Kely be.
He is unlike any other.	Tsy toy ny hafa izy.
Not that he didn’t try.	Tsy hoe tsy nanandrana izy.
He is ready, and he can.	Vonona izy, ary afaka.
I see him now.	Hitako izy izao.
The drive is over an hour.	Adiny iray mahery ny fiara.
He didn't look at it.	Tsy nijery izany izy.
We talk without talking.	Miresaka tsy miteny izahay.
Despite this, we never seem to talk about it.	Na dia eo aza izany dia toa tsy mbola niresaka momba izany mihitsy izahay.
There may be another.	Mety hisy iray hafa.
He was not fully aware of the danger.	Tsy fantany tanteraka ny loza.
We are many.	Maro isika.
He never did it again.	Tsy nanao izany intsony izy.
Whoever talked to him, about it.	Na iza no niresaka taminy, momba izany.
I can.	Vitako.
The day is different.	Hafa ny andro.
But you seem to know that.	Saingy toa fantatrao izany.
You ask me where they are.	Manontany ahy ianao hoe aiza izy ireo.
We don’t need that.	Tsy mila izany izahay.
I have never met one.	Tsy mbola nihaona na dia iray aza aho.
A completely different person.	Olona hafa tanteraka.
Men are different.	Hafa ny lehilahy.
No one knows if the story is true or not.	Tsy misy mahalala na marina na tsia ny tantara.
It could not have happened.	Tsy mety nisy.
I won’t lose anything going.	Tsy ho very na inona na inona handeha aho.
But now he is the right man.	Saingy amin'izao fotoana izao dia izy no lehilahy marina.
And it’s not done.	Ary tsy vita.
It may seem like a new idea, but it really isn’t.	Mety ho toy ny hevitra vaovao ilay izy, saingy tsy izany tokoa.
They did better.	Nanao zavatra tsara kokoa izy ireo.
It was as if it didn’t exist.	Toy ny hoe tsy nisy izany.
It wasn’t too bad in the end.	Tsy dia ratsy loatra izany tamin'ny farany.
It tells you.	Milaza aminao izany.
Good for him.	Tsara ho azy.
Not that you had to do it.	Tsy hoe nila nanao izany ianao.
Such a great book.	Boky lehibe toy izany.
That’s a reason, of course.	Antony iray izany, mazava ho azy.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.
You want them to come.	Tianao ho avy izy ireo.
I don’t know how that happened.	Tsy fantatro hoe ahoana no nahatonga izany.
And work is work.	Ary ny asa dia asa.
I met him over the years.	Nihaona taminy aho nandritra ny taona maro.
Same as you.	Mitovy amin'ny anao.
He is very much like you.	Tena mitovy aminao izy.
I don’t understand why everyone has to drive.	Tsy azoko hoe nahoana ny rehetra no tsy maintsy mitondra fiara.
Help came quickly.	Tonga haingana ny fanampiana.
One meal, please.	Sakafo iray, azafady.
Even if they don’t know it.	Na dia tsy fantany aza izany.
I don’t do anything else at all.	Tsy misy zavatra hafa ataoko mihitsy.
Not that he expected.	Tsy hoe nanantena izy.
Too far.	Lavitra loatra.
It's a disaster.	Loza izany.
He was very sick.	Narary mafy izy.
He doesn’t do that either, apparently.	Tsy manao izany koa izy, toa.
I thought he was crazy at first.	Nihevitra aho fa adala izy tamin'ny voalohany.
I hope he doesn’t.	Manantena aho fa tsy hanao izany izy.
And don’t worry.	Ary aza manahy.
When he said he would bring the food upstairs.	Rehefa nilaza izy fa hitondra ny sakafo any ambony.
They also did other work.	Nahavita asa hafa koa izy ireo.
Maybe more than that.	Angamba mihoatra noho izany.
It told him they were close.	Nilaza taminy izany fa akaiky izy ireo.
Even if people don’t believe me, it’s true.	Na tsy mino ahy aza ny olona dia marina izany.
I didn't even look at him.	Tsy mba nijery azy akory aho.
They did not write but spoke.	Tsy nanoratra izy ireo fa niteny.
Everyone else seems to be doing the same.	Toa manao toy izany koa ny hafa rehetra.
The fool, the foolish little fool.	Ny adala, ny adala kely adala.
I don't remember anything.	Tsy tadidiko na inona na inona.
Too many died on his body.	Be loatra ny maty teo amin'ny tenany.
They came first.	Izy ireo no tonga voalohany.
That seems to be true.	Toa marina izany.
He did it.	Nanao izany izy.
Since last week it has been working well.	Hatramin'ny herinandro lasa dia miasa tsara.
I can't stay tonight for personal reasons.	Tsy afaka mijanona anio alina aho noho ny antony manokana.
He came last.	Izy no tonga farany.
I know people who have it.	Fantatro ny olona manana azy io.
Went a long way	Nandeha dia lavitra
But that's the idea.	Fa izany no hevitra.
I would be happy to learn more about you.	Ho faly aho hianatra bebe kokoa momba anao.
He was done for me.	Vita ho ahy izy.
Antony.	Antony.
The students tried it.	Nanandrana izany ny mpianatra.
For sure.	Ny azo antoka.
And look good.	Ary mijery tsara.
However, we finally managed.	Na izany aza, nahavita ihany izahay.
I can tell you exactly.	Afaka milaza aminao tsara aho.
They will come.	Ho avy izy ireo.
So the question is too early.	Noho izany ny fanontaniana dia aloha loatra.
Yes, it may not be, but if you can have it there will be.	Eny, mety tsy izany, fa raha afaka manana izany dia hisy.
Of course, we never talked about it.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy niresaka momba izany mihitsy izahay.
He had to get out.	Tsy maintsy nivoaka izy.
I couldn't do that.	Tsy afaka nanao izany aho.
They probably didn’t.	Tsy nanao izany angamba izy ireo.
You know you haven’t seen the worst yet.	Fantatrao fa mbola tsy nahita ny ratsy indrindra ianao.
In about a month.	Amin'ny iray volana eo ho eo.
Not just today.	Tsy androany fotsiny.
It’s nice to see old friends again.	Mahafinaritra ny mahita namana taloha indray.
I want to see him, right away.	Te hahita azy aho, avy hatrany.
I thought he needed help.	Nihevitra aho fa nila fanampiana izy.
There is so much to do.	Be dia be ny zavatra tokony hatao.
He ate a quick breakfast.	Nihinana sakafo maraina haingana izy.
I don’t eat that stuff, no.	Tsy mihinana izany zavatra izany aho, tsia.
Thank you for starting this.	Misaotra anao nanomboka ity.
No one helped him.	Tsy nisy olona nanampy azy.
In fact, this is a real place.	Raha ny marina dia toerana tena izy ity.
It’s hard not to look at it.	Sarotra ny tsy mijery azy.
Just like last time.	Toy ny tamin'ny fotoana farany ihany.
Could you.	Ianao ve afaka.
I saw one but not alive, and he saw two.	Nahita iray aho fa tsy velona, ​​ary nahita roa izy.
‘I’ do it.	'Izaho' no manao izany.
Hopefully it will be better than the last.	Manantena fa ho tsara kokoa noho ny farany.
I don’t do that stuff.	Tsy manao an'io zavatra io aho.
There were, perhaps, who did.	Nisy, angamba, izay nanao izany.
They are more than that.	Mihoatra noho izany izy ireo.
He knew it.	Fantany izany.
That’s what brought him back.	Izany no nahatonga azy hiverina.
Updates will also be released throughout the day.	Hivoaka mandritra ny andro ihany koa ny vaovao farany.
He sat down and wondered how it could be so completely wrong.	Nipetraka izy ary nanontany tena hoe ahoana no mety ho diso tanteraka.
It was all there.	Teo daholo.
The food arrived quickly.	Tonga haingana ny sakafo.
Then we waited.	Dia niandry izahay.
I did two things.	Nanao zavatra roa aho.
It doesn’t read bad.	Tsy mamaky ratsy.
He looked, waiting.	Nijery izy, niandry.
I really am not.	Tena tsy izany aho.
He went his own.	Nandeha ny azy izy.
They are like dogs.	Toy ny alika izy ireo.
You never look far.	Tsy mijery lavitra mihitsy ianao.
Everyone says so.	Samy milaza izany ny rehetra.
Yes, he may have done so.	Eny, mety nanao izany izy.
It could happen here.	Mety hitranga eto izany.
You don’t get a job again.	Tsy mahazo asa indray ianao.
Otherwise, you may not find much.	Raha tsy izany dia mety tsy hahita zavatra betsaka ianao.
Sure, there could be others.	Azo antoka fa mety hisy hafa.
But everything was fine, everything looked good.	Saingy tsara ny zava-drehetra, nijery tsara ny zava-drehetra.
He is a very nice person.	Tena olona mahafinaritra izy.
This one is quick and easy.	Ity iray ity dia haingana sy mora.
I love you	tiako ianao
He might be interested.	Mety ho liana izy.
You can do this at the same time.	Azonao atao ny manao izany amin'ny fotoana iray ihany.
I have to finish this soon.	Tsy maintsy vitako tsy ho ela ity.
In fact, the woman always looked good.	Raha ny marina, nijery tsara foana ilay vehivavy.
He wondered where he was tonight.	Nanontany tena izy hoe taiza izy izao hariva izao.
Different but not better.	Hafa fa tsy tsara kokoa.
Then came the few days.	Avy eo dia tonga ny andro vitsivitsy.
But this is really fun.	Fa tena mahafinaritra tokoa ity.
You really don’t want to be wrong.	Tena tsy te ho diso ianao.
They may have been there.	Mety ho tao izy ireo.
In a way.	Amin'ny fomba iray.
Have a great time.	Manana fotoana mahafinaritra.
If he was interested, he could see it.	Raha liana izy dia afaka nahita azy.
We have to leave soon.	Tsy maintsy miala tsy ho ela isika.
He walked, still talking.	Nandeha izy, mbola niresaka.
I'm really not sure.	Tena tsy azoko antoka.
The house was more crowded.	Feno olona kokoa ny trano.
Not if you want to get out the door.	Tsy raha te hivoaka ny varavarana ianao.
He seemed happy.	Toa faly izy.
No one knows where he is.	Tsy misy mahalala ny misy azy.
Bad news.	Vaovao ratsy.
You need it now.	Mila izany ianao izao.
But then he left.	Saingy lasa izy avy eo.
From day one.	Avy amin'ny andro iray.
I've been thinking about that too.	Efa nieritreritra izany koa aho.
I looked at you.	Nijery anao aho.
That’s a lot.	Be dia be izany.
No one was here.	Tsy nisy olona teto.
He is a good man.	Lehilahy tsara izy.
This is very bad.	Tena ratsy izany.
Whatever it may be.	Izay rehetra mety ho izy.
He doesn’t really care about you anymore.	Tsy dia miraharaha anao intsony izy.
Buy It Now!.	Hividy azy izao!.
The story is over.	Vita izao ilay tantara.
Then it finally spoke.	Avy eo dia niteny ihany ilay izy.
Is it necessary?	Ilaina ve izany?
Work can wait.	Afaka miandry ny asa.
I will go.	Handeha aho.
You will eventually find them.	Hahita azy ireo ianao amin'ny farany.
Very good.	Tsara be.
I've tried it, it goes well.	Efa nanandrana aho, mandeha tsara.
They have already started talking about it.	Efa nanomboka niresaka momba izany izy ireo.
The man stopped.	Nijanona ilay lehilahy.
It's too long.	Lava loatra izany.
I didn’t know anything about it until a few weeks ago.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona fantatro momba izany raha tsy herinandro vitsivitsy lasa izay.
He did it well.	Nataony tsara izany.
I doubt it’s about them.	Misalasala aho raha momba azy ireo.
Anything might help.	Na inona na inona mety hanampy.
I don’t get it in the slightest.	Tsy azoko izany na dia kely aza.
Yes, yes, there is.	Eny, eny, misy.
I did the same before, it worked well.	Nanao toy izany koa aho taloha, niasa tsara.
He intended to stay completely.	Nikasa ny hijanona tanteraka izy.
You are very happy.	Tena faly ianao.
I was no different.	Tsy nisy hafa tamin’ny hafa aho.
They don't need us to die to get it.	Tsy mila antsika maty izy ireo vao mahazo izany.
The room looks like him now.	Toa azy ilay efitrano ankehitriny.
Here, everything is recent.	Eto, vao haingana ny zava-drehetra.
He didn’t even know it until recently.	Tsy fantany akory izany raha tsy vao haingana.
I am not here for new friends.	Tsy eto aho ho an'ny namana vaovao.
It’s something else.	Zavatra hafa izany.
Of course, he used to be worse than he is now.	Mazava ho azy fa ratsy kokoa noho ny ankehitriny izy taloha.
But from the beginning, nothing went well.	Saingy hatramin'ny voalohany dia tsy nisy zavatra nandeha tsara.
I will not be here in the morning.	Tsy ho eto aho ny maraina.
I didn’t think of that at the time.	Tsy nieritreritra an'izany aho tamin'izany.
It came out well.	Nivoaka tsara ilay izy.
You can’t learn about it.	Tsy afaka mianatra momba izany ianao.
We should have called him yesterday.	Tokony niantso azy izahay omaly.
I'll see him tomorrow.	Hahita azy aho rahampitso.
If you don’t get them, you don’t get anywhere.	Raha tsy mahazo azy ireo ianao dia tsy mahazo na aiza na aiza.
Yes, it is something.	Eny, zavatra izany.
And he knows about me.	Ary fantany ny momba ahy.

Exactly as it happened.	Tena araka ny nitranga.
It works well.	Miasa tsara izany.
Thanks for the dinner.	Misaotra tamin'ny sakafo hariva.

I’m the only one doing it.	Izaho irery ihany no manao izany.
The house is empty.	Foana ny trano.
We looked at it like history.	Nijery azy toy ny tantara izahay.

Or they.	Na izy ireo.
I don't know that.	Tsy fantatro izay.
We are all the same.	Mitovy daholo isika rehetra.
Maybe it would have been better if he had slept.	Tsara kokoa angamba raha natory izy.
I want to tell you.	Te hilaza aminao aho.
It’s sick and uncomfortable if he doesn’t do it.	Marary sy tsy mety raha tsy manao izany izy.
Very powerful.	Tena mahery.
Thought about it.	Nieritreritra an'io.

That person is not me.	Tsy izaho izany olona izany.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra.
I'm pretty sure.	Tena azoko antoka.
When he entered the room, everyone stopped talking.	Rehefa niditra ny efitrano izy dia tsy niresaka intsony ny rehetra.
We are the same.	Mitovy isika.
He felt better.	Nahatsiaro ho tsara kokoa izy.

What things have to be done.	Inona no zavatra tsy maintsy atao.
If they want to get something from him, they can.	Raha te hahazo zavatra avy aminy izy ireo dia afaka.

No one asked for it.	Tsy nisy nangataka izany.
This is the new way.	Izany no fomba vaovao.
It should be fun.	Tokony ho mahafinaritra.

It could have been a great week for him in other ways.	Mety ho herinandro lehibe ho azy izany amin'ny fomba hafa.
However, it did not provide.	Na izany aza, tsy nanome.
He was most confused.	Very hevitra indrindra izy.
There is no place for that here.	Tsy misy toerana ho an'izany eto.
Now you get it.	Izao dia azonao izany.
Some children love to play outside.	Misy ankizy tia milalao any ivelany.
He immediately recognized the image.	Tonga dia fantany ilay sary.
That is exactly the time and place.	Izany indrindra no fotoana sy toerana.
Died again.	Maty indray.
So yes, that's right.	Ka eny, marina izany.
I could not be wrong, in fact.	Tsy nety ho diso aho, raha ny marina.
Sounds fun.	Toa mahafinaritra.

I'm still there.	Mbola any aho.
The woman seemed confused.	Toa very hevitra ilay vehivavy.
Especially at the same time of day.	Indrindra amin'ny fotoana mitovy amin'ny andro.
There are two ways to do this.	Misy fomba roa hanaovana izany.
Not that we get many.	Tsy hoe mahazo maro isika.
You will grow up.	Ho lehibe ianao.
It needs to work.	Mila miasa.

Do you?.	Ianao ve?.
So, we started from that.	Noho izany, nanomboka tamin'izany izahay.

We can talk about it.	Afaka miresaka momba izany isika.
Nothing happened there either.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona nitranga tao koa.
So don’t even talk !.	Ka aza miteny mihitsy!.
The other one is good.	Ny iray hafa dia tsara.
Very good.	Tena tsara.
I don’t want you to be angry with him.	Tsy tiako ho tezitra aminy ianao.
The weather here is always good.	Tsara foana ny andro eto.
Everyone knows that word.	Fantatry ny olona rehetra io teny io.
If you don’t, you have a problem.	Raha tsy manao izany ianao dia manana olana.
They also didn’t get much.	Tsy nahazo betsaka koa izy ireo.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Diso, diso, diso.
This is very untrue.	Tena tsy marina izany.
I decided we should go on the weekend.	Nanapa-kevitra aho fa tokony handeha amin'ny faran'ny herinandro isika.
Tell him what happened.	Lazao azy ny zava-nitranga.
He doesn’t speak often.	Tsy miteny matetika izy.
Not on this earth.	Tsy eto amin’ity tany ity.
Thank you for watching.	Misaotra anao nijery.
But you will love it.	Fa ho tianao izany.
But these are different times.	Saingy fotoana samy hafa ireo.
Get lost.	Lasa very.
Then it was completely different.	Dia hafa mihitsy ilay izy.
He is also very strong.	Mahery be koa izy.
There isn’t even one.	Tsy misy na dia iray aza.
It’s fun.	Mahafinaritra izany.
And went.	Dia nandeha.
And it doesn’t matter.	Ary tsy maninona izany.
I like to do it the same way.	Tiako ny hanao izany amin'ny fomba mitovy.
No one will tell me why.	Tsy hisy hilaza amiko ny antony .
In fact, he died last week.	Raha ny marina dia maty tamin'ny herinandro lasa izy.
I do not understand.	tsy azoko.
And that is a big mistake.	Ary fahadisoana lehibe izany.
He was probably very honest with himself.	Tena marina tamin'ny tenany angamba izy.
But in reality, the play was completely different.	Saingy raha ny tena izy dia hafa tanteraka ny nilalao.
You can do this job if you really try.	Afaka manao io asa io ianao raha tena miezaka.
In fact, you shouldn’t be alone with me.	Raha ny marina, tsy tokony ho irery miaraka amiko ianao.
When you like it.	Rehefa tianao izany.
Maybe so.	Angamba izany.
Because we can’t do much about it.	Satria tsy afaka manao zavatra betsaka momba izany isika.
Only one person can be like that.	Olona iray ihany no mety ho toy izany.
Please tell me this is not.	Mba lazao ahy fa tsy ity.
And maybe he hoped he wouldn't.	Ary angamba nanantena izy fa tsy hanao izany.
Since last month.	Hatramin'ny volana lasa teo.
I never knew that, until recently.	Tsy fantatro mihitsy izany, hatramin'ny vao haingana.
As long as their children had no problems, they were happy.	Raha mbola tsy nisy olana ny zanany dia faly izy ireo.
She enjoyed being with him.	Nahafinaritra azy ny niaraka taminy.
Stayed with me.	Nijanona niaraka tamiko.
What could be	Inona no mety ho
You can find it for yourself.	Afaka mahita izany ho anao ianao.
Absolutely nothing can be done.	Tena tsy misy azo atao.
In any case, the word always came to him.	Na ahoana na ahoana, dia tonga taminy foana ny teny.
Now, there is a lot of money.	Ankehitriny, , misy vola be.
We were so wrong.	Diso be izahay.
He spent the night.	Nandany ny alina izy.
It's fast.	Haingana izany.
But it has to be done !.	Fa tsy maintsy atao!.
So do we.	Toy izany koa isika.
He just exists.	Misy fotsiny izy.
That's right.	Izany tokoa.
They will be more willing to help.	Ho vonona kokoa ny hanampy izy ireo.
He.	Izy.
I'm not looking at anything.	Tsy mijery na inona na inona aho.
You need to learn to eat.	Mila mianatra mihinana ianao.
i get you.	mahazo anao aho.
I wrote this.	Nanoratra ity aho.
I love him here.	Tiako izy eto.
I'm happy for him.	Faly ho azy aho.
I just wanted a dog.	Naniry alika fotsiny aho.
Today has been a wonderful day.	Nahafinaritra ny androany.
This is for many reasons.	Izany dia noho ny antony maro.
It doesn’t look good.	Toa tsy tsara izany.
Of course, they must be wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy ho diso hevitra izy ireo.
But we are not yet at the end of the story.	Saingy tsy mbola tonga amin'ny faran'ny tantara isika.
And it’s certainly bigger than the last.	Ary azo antoka fa lehibe noho ny farany.
He doesn't need one.	Tsy mila iray izy.
The work was done before nightfall.	Vita alohan’ny alina ny asa.
Especially if he had been drinking.	Indrindra raha efa nisotro izy.
And they love him.	Ary tia azy izy ireo.
I must go.	Tsy maintsy mandeha aho.
That’s one thing he didn’t do.	Izany no zavatra iray tsy nataony.
Although it won’t be.	Na dia tsy ho izy aza.
I don't want him to come.	Tsy tiako ho avy izy.
In real time.	Amin'ny fotoana tena izy.
I went to tell him.	Nandeha aho nilaza taminy.
That’s enough for everyone.	Ampy ho an'ny rehetra izany.
And he will get used to it.	Ary ho zatra izany izy.
This made it more difficult.	Nahatonga azy ho sarotra kokoa izany.
I don’t remember how many years ago.	Tsy tadidiko hoe firy taona lasa izay.
This is where it stays.	Eto no hijanona.
I did it.	Nataoko izany.
Of course, I saw something else.	Mazava ho azy fa mbola nisy zavatra hafa hitako.
I think you should go to him last.	Heveriko fa tokony handeha any aminy farany ianao.
This is the only known image.	Ity ihany no sary fantatra.
Thanks for trying.	Misaotra nanandrana.
He didn't want everyone to know about him.	Tsy tiany ho fantatry ny rehetra ny momba azy.
You know, a really beautiful thing.	Fantatrao, zavatra tena tsara tarehy.
But it's not.	Saingy tsy izany.
i have it.	manana azy aho.
I enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra ahy izany.
I'm still okay.	Mbola mety aho.
I really like it.	Tena tiako izany.
Do your best work with people you know.	Manao asa tsara indrindra amin'ny olona fantatrao.
And so, it’s hard to get.	Ary noho izany, fa sarotra ny mahazo.
Just a dog.	Alika fotsiny.
Let someone do something soon.	Aleo misy manao zavatra tsy ho ela.
Men don’t want to talk to you.	Tsy te hiresaka aminao ny lehilahy.
Here, there was none.	Eto, tsy nisy.
It’s about everything.	Momba ny zava-drehetra izany.
This thing has to stop.	Tsy maintsy mijanona io zavatra io.
The hour is gone.	Lasa ny ora.
They are very different.	Hafa mihitsy izy ireo.
I will go out.	Hivoaka aho.
He knows when it is.	Fantany hoe rahoviana izany.
They are really ready to go.	Tena vonona ny handeha izy ireo.
Which no one saw.	Izay tsy nisy nahita.
He hadn't looked at them in a long time.	Efa ela izy no tsy nijery azy ireo.
There seemed to be a lot at the time.	Toa be dia be tamin'izany fotoana izany.
However, enough for now.	Na izany aza, ampy amin'izao fotoana izao.
But that is not true.	Saingy tsy marina izany.
We are not the only ones who are afraid.	Tsy isika ihany no matahotra.
He had seen a car there before.	Efa nahita fiara teo izy taloha.
This is so crazy.	Tena adala izany.
This is a small mistake.	Fahadisoana kely izany.
Very well done !.	Tena vita tsara!.
Thank you, thank you, thank you !.	Misaotra, misaotra, misaotra!.
But it still doesn’t matter.	Saingy mbola tsy maninona izany.
And a lot if we can get it.	Ary be dia be raha afaka mahazo izany isika.
I didn’t see the kids anywhere.	Tsy hitako na taiza na taiza ireo ankizy.
You have to have it.	Tsy maintsy manana izany ianao.
They haven’t had a single day in three years.	Tsy nisy na dia iray andro aza izy ireo nandritra ny telo taona.
You should not make the same mistake.	Tsy tokony hanao fahadisoana mitovy amin'izany koa ianao.
But he can’t, not yet.	Saingy tsy afaka izy, tsy mbola.
He thought he was dead.	Nihevitra izy fa maty izy.
I really don’t remember.	Tena tsy tadidiko.
If not, it’s okay.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy maninona.
Sorry I have to do that.	Miala tsiny fa tsy maintsy manao izany.
This movie doesn’t do that.	Tsy manao izany ity sarimihetsika ity.
Another day done.	Andro hafa vita.
If so, it’s probably this afternoon or tonight.	Raha izany no izy dia azo inoana fa ny tolakandro na izao hariva izao.
Breakfast is ready.	Efa vonona ny sakafo maraina.
I really understand.	Tena azoko.
Without history, there is no future.	Raha tsy misy ny tantara dia tsy misy ny ho avy.
He likes bad.	Ratsy no tiany.
But they are there.	Saingy eo izy ireo.
I arrived too late.	Tara loatra aho vao tonga.
We lost last week.	Very izahay tamin'ny herinandro lasa teo.
I'm not trying.	Tsy miezaka aho.
The road is unsafe.	Tsy azo antoka ny lalana.
Not with you sick.	Tsy miaraka aminao marary.
I'm not sure.	Tsy azoko antoka.
It was a wonderful day.	Dia andro mahafinaritra.
A lot of things don’t go as well as they used to.	Betsaka ny zavatra tsy mandeha tsara toy ny taloha.
I'll go, if you want me to go.	Handeha aho, raha tianao handeha aho.
It may be different at first.	Mety ho hafa izany amin’ny voalohany.
But they are as good as they are now.	Saingy tsara toy ny tsy eo izy ireo ankehitriny.
I want to be here.	Te ho eto aho.
It’s a really fun thing to do.	Tena zavatra mahafinaritra izany.
They just walk away often.	Mandeha fotsiny izy ireo matetika.
I enjoyed it and learned a lot.	Nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy ary nianatra zavatra maro.
It's not.	Io dia tsy.
What else can he do.	Inona koa no azony atao.
He was wrong.	Diso izy.
I will help you with that.	Hanampy anao amin'izany aho.
Still very sick.	Mbola marary mafy.
He shouldn’t have done that either.	Tsy tokony ho nanao izany koa.
If they did, they would probably win.	Raha nanao izany izy ireo dia azo inoana fa handresy.
I don't understand it very well.	Tsy azoko tsara ilay izy.
He has grown up.	Efa lehibe izy.
I think they might do that.	Heveriko fa mety hanao izany izy ireo.
In fact, many believe it will happen.	Raha ny marina dia maro no mino fa hitranga izany.
I have them, but not much work.	Manana azy ireo aho, saingy tsy misy asa be.
It was difficult for everyone.	Sarotra tamin'ny rehetra izany.
He doesn’t seem to sleep through the night.	Toa tsy matory mandritra ny alina izy.
Students have no idea.	Tsy manana hevitra ny mpianatra.
He didn't look at me.	Tsy nijery ahy izy.
The latter called him.	Ilay farany niantso azy.
After a good night's sleep, he felt well.	Rehefa avy natory tsara izy dia nahatsiaro tsara.
They came out.	Nivoaka izy ireo.
It's a dog.	Dia alika.
You said he was busy.	Ianao no nilaza fa sahirana izy.
I am very happy.	Tena faly aho.
Mine can wait.	Ny ahy dia afaka miandry.
The trip here was fun.	Nahafinaritra ny dia teto.
There was another reason.	Nisy antony hafa koa.
Of course he knew.	Mazava ho azy fa fantany.
I wonder where he lives.	Manontany tena aho hoe aiza izy no mipetraka.
I tried to do this in two ways.	Nanandrana nanao izany tamin'ny fomba roa aho.
He was very surprised.	Tena gaga izy.
Therefore, there may be errors.	Noho izany, mety misy fahadisoana.
You are at home.	Ao an-trano ianao.
They are the only ones doing it.	Izy ireo ihany no manao izany.
I have never heard of it.	Tsy mbola nandre izany aho.
And you will be better too.	Ary ho tsara kokoa koa ianao.
It doesn't seem to be.	Toa tsy ilay izy.
Good if you're with me.	Tsara raha miaraka amiko ianao.
We have to get out.	Tokony hivoaka isika.
The trip was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay dia.
I doubt that's all.	Misalasala aho fa izay ihany.
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.

He must love her.	Tsy maintsy tia azy izy.
We often met here.	Matetika izahay no nihaona teto.
But all this is to come.	Fa izany rehetra izany dia ho avy.
That’s two things.	Zavatra roa izany.
You need to help us.	Mila manampy anay ianao.
It doesn't work.	Tsy mandeha izany.
I finally heard it from a woman.	Nandre izany tamin'ny vehivavy iray aho tamin'ny farany.
All you can do is watch when they leave.	Ny hany azonao atao dia ny mijery rehefa miala izy ireo.
He eats almost anything.	Saika mihinana na inona na inona izy.
Maybe it would be better if they did.	Angamba ho tsara kokoa raha manao izany izy ireo.
Probably not much.	Tsy betsaka angamba.
These are easy.	Ireo no mora.
You can't see it.	Tsy afaka mahita azy ianao.
It's a little different.	Hafa kely izany.

I told him the latter.	Nolazaiko azy ity farany.
And mine is lost.	Ary ahy ny very.
There will be bad days tomorrow.	Hisy andro ratsy rahampitso.
It was just there.	Tany fotsiny ilay izy.

Kids are anything but beautiful.	Ny ankizy dia na inona na inona fa tsara tarehy.
Maybe he did.	Angamba nanao izany izy.
He wanted to watch.	Te hijery izy.
He no longer knew what he was.	Tsy fantany intsony hoe inona izy.
It just can’t be done.	Tsy azo atao fotsiny izany.
We will talk about that tomorrow.	Hiresaka momba izany isika rahampitso.
This is for many reasons.	Izany dia noho ny antony maro.
It can happen to anyone at any time.	Mety hitranga amin'ny olona rehetra izany amin'ny fotoana rehetra.
He wanted to be good to her.	Naniry ny ho tsara ho azy izy.
It’s going to happen, it’s going to happen.	Ho tanteraka izany, tsy maintsy hitranga izany.
Got as many cars as I do now.	Nahazo fiara maro toy ny amin'izao fotoana izao.
And it is not an easy task.	Ary tsy asa mora izany.
One of these could be for them.	Ny iray amin'ireo dia mety ho azy ireo.

Can't wait until it goes away !.	Tsy afaka miandry raha tsy mandeha ho azy!.

Like a movie.	Toy ny sarimihetsika.
Players know they can do the job.	Fantatry ny mpilalao fa afaka manao ny asa izy ireo.

Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	Niresaka momba izany ny rehetra, saingy tsy nisy nanao na inona na inona.
Can someone do that, please?	Misy afaka manao izany ve azafady.
I've tried it.	Efa nanandrana izany aho.
He saw it, but he refused to tell her.	Nahita izy, nefa tsy nety nilaza taminy.
You only know one place.	Toerana iray ihany no fantatrao.
They went at night.	Nandeha alina izy ireo.
He was confused.	Very hevitra izy.
Mora.	Mora.
This is especially true of music.	Marina indrindra izany tamin’ny mozika.
However, as is well known.	Na izany aza, araka ny fantatra.
It's a disaster.	Loza izany.
It wasn't that he needed help from his heart.	Tsy hoe nila fanampiana tamin’ny fony izy.
Not that he will do it but still.	Tsy hoe hanao izany izy fa mbola.
He refused to talk to me.	Tsy nety niresaka tamiko izy.

He said he couldn’t do the same thing anymore.	Nilaza izy fa tsy afaka manao zavatra mitovy intsony.
He loves it here.	Tiany eto.
I just asked him.	Vao avy nanontany azy aho.
Maybe it’s, just done.	Mety ho azy io, vao vita.
He has always been like that.	Efa toy izany foana izy.
For food or clothing.	Ho an'ny sakafo na akanjo.
I'm really worried about him.	Tena manahy azy aho.
Because they both play.	Satria samy milalao.
But we will be there for him.	Fa ho eo izahay ho azy.
A few years ago, it rained for several days.	Taona vitsivitsy lasa izay, avy ny orana nandritra ny andro maro.
I have money if you will.	Vola aho raha tianao.
However, there are other reasons that seem plausible as well.	Na izany aza, misy antony hafa toa azo inoana koa.
He thought he knew.	Nihevitra izy fa fantany.

I know you are there.	Fantatro fa eo ianao.
There is no other way.	Tsy misy fomba hafa.
We are now far from the water.	Lavitra ny rano izahay izao.
If he had, he probably never left.	Raha nanana izy, dia mety tsy niala mihitsy.
Not too far, but enough.	Tsy dia lavitra, fa ampy.
In many others.	Amin'ny maro hafa.
We talk a little.	Miresaka kely izahay.
Like you, here.	Toy ny anao, eto.
I have never said that.	Mbola tsy niteny an'izany mihitsy aho.
It seems too late.	Toa farany loatra ilay izy.
She is very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy izy.
I don't need sleep.	Tsy mila torimaso aho.
He himself will see you.	Izy mihitsy no hahita anao.
He could be anyone.	Mety ho na iza na iza izy.
It was as if he didn’t exist.	Toy ny hoe tsy nisy izy.
What a place this is.	Toerana inona ity.
In any case.	Na ahoana na ahoana.
We agree.	Mitovy hevitra isika.
That seems like the best idea.	Toa ny hevitra tsara indrindra izany.
Because he was already there.	Noho izy efa tany.
It was a tragedy.	Loza ilay izy.
But of course that is not possible.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy azo atao izany.
It may also exist.	Mety misy koa izy io.
Maybe they do.	Angamba manao izany izy ireo.
Or make music.	Na manao mozika.
And we’ll get you next year.	Ary hahazo anao izahay amin'ny taona manaraka.
People need jobs.	Mila asa ny olona.
I don’t like this approach.	Tsy tiako io fomba io.
However, it was almost always crowded.	Na izany aza, saika feno olona foana izy io.

Only you should be on top.	Ianao ihany no tokony ho eo ambony.
That is far from it, in fact.	Lavitra izany, raha ny marina.
As soon as we got out there we did it.	Vao nivoaka teo izahay dia nanao izany.
They may also need good food.	Nila sakafo tsara koa angamba izy ireo.
There was a girl with him.	Nisy tovovavy niaraka taminy.

They wonder how the other man is doing.	Manontany tena izy ireo hoe manao ahoana koa ilay lehilahy hafa.
In fact, they are very different.	Tena samy hafa izy ireo, raha ny marina.

We went fast.	Nandeha haingana izahay.
The first method.	Ny fomba voalohany.

If you don’t find them, nothing is lost.	Raha tsy nahita azy ireo ianao dia tsy misy very.

I could not eat anything.	Tsy afaka nihinana na inona na inona aho.
Maybe he still does.	Angamba mbola manao izany izy.
But the word did not come.	Nefa tsy tonga ny teny.
You can do something like this.	Afaka manao zavatra toy izao ianao.
Isn't that a real thing.	Tsy tena zavatra ve izany.
The two are not the same at all.	Tsy mitovy mihitsy ireo roa ireo.
What he did.	Inona no nataony.
The truth is a bit more complicated.	Ny marina dia somary sarotra kokoa.
You will be home soon.	Hody tsy ho ela ianao.
With a small child.	Miaraka amin'ny zaza kely.
Are you sleeping well tonight?	Matory tsara ve ianao anio alina?
Maybe that's why he wasn't with her.	Izany angamba no nahatonga azy tsy ho eo aminy.
Arrived today, all is well.	Tonga tany androany, tsara daholo ny zava-drehetra.
I came back to tell you that.	Niverina aho hilaza aminao izany.
Sorry, this is not possible.	Miala tsiny fa tsy azo atao izany.
They talk about it.	Miresaka momba izany izy ireo.
So glad to see you.	Faly be ny mahita anao.
We need a car.	Mila fiara izahay.
I remember him.	Tadidiko izy.
In a few days he would see her again.	Afaka andro vitsivitsy dia hahita azy indray izy.
What is yours ?.	Inona ny anao?.
We have food.	Manana sakafo izahay.
It’s just not done.	Tsy vita fotsiny izany.
He seemed to have just returned from work.	Toa vao avy niasa izy.
Children go to school when they are young.	Mandeha mianatra ny ankizy raha mbola kely.
He was waiting for me this morning.	Niandry ahy izy androany maraina.
We look forward to seeing you.	Manantena ny hahita anao izahay.
He is alive, but only.	Velona izy, nefa fotsiny ihany.
Now all that will be gone.	Ankehitriny dia tsy hisy izany rehetra izany.
I will be here tomorrow.	Ho avy eto aho rahampitso.
It was wrong.	Tsy nety izany.
No one spoke at all.	Tsy nisy niteny mihitsy.
We women are talking about things.	Miresaka zavatra izahay vehivavy.
And it's too early.	Ary aloha be izao.
I just left home.	Vao niala tao an-trano aho.
The house is still empty.	Mbola foana ny trano.
He hoped it wasn't.	Nanantena izy fa tsy izy io.
And he still knows it.	Ary mbola fantany izany.
Very good.	Tena tsara.
Not too much.	Tsy dia betsaka loatra.
Very little.	Kely dia kely.
There was not enough food, and not enough water.	Tsy ampy ny sakafo, ary tsy ampy ny rano.
The house was always empty.	Nijanona foana ny trano.
The food is very good.	Tena tsara ny sakafo.
I should have been with you no matter what.	Tokony ho teo aminao aho na inona na inona.
It's close by, so it's a good fit.	Eo akaiky eo, ka mety tsara.
It is no different.	Tsy hafa mihitsy izany.
He doesn’t care.	Tsy miraharaha izy.
All children must do this.	Tsy maintsy manao izany ny ankizy rehetra.
Very good and very clear.	Tena tsara ary mazava tsara.
They were really fun for the first month or so.	Tena nahafinaritra tokoa izy ireo nandritra ny volana voalohany na mihoatra.
It doesn’t matter what’s really true.	Tsy maninona izay tena marina.
I don’t really know who they are.	Tsy tena fantatro hoe iza izy ireo.
Came here to party.	Tonga teto mba hanao fety.
Good food.	Sakafo tsara.
Don’t ask that woman.	Aza manontany io vehivavy io.
That's better.	Tsara kokoa izany.
It helps us to learn.	Manampy antsika hianatra izany.
He knew they would never meet again.	Fantany fa tsy hihaona intsony izy ireo.
I’m usually happy.	Matetika aho no faly.
When you leave.	Rehefa miala ianao.
He said he just wanted to talk.	Nilaza izy fa te hiresaka fotsiny.
But for himself.	Fa ho an'ny tenany.
He read a book.	Namaky boky izy.
I was never afraid of hard work.	Tsy natahotra asa mafy mihitsy aho.
But that is not the case.	Saingy tsy izany no izy.
It always has and always will be.	Manana foana ary ho foana.
Someone gave him a little, but not much.	Nisy nanome kely azy, fa tsy be.
I have a good idea.	Manana hevitra tsara aho.
He might have something there.	Mety manana zavatra izy any.
It may not even have seen him.	Mety tsy nahita azy akory izany.
We were able to try.	Afaka nanandrana izahay.
Everyone in the house.	Ireo olona rehetra tao an-trano.
She believes her son is dead.	Mino izy fa maty ny zanany.
But the problem remained money.	Saingy ny olana dia nijanona ho vola.
You can also go back to me in another way.	Azonao atao ihany koa ny mandeha indray amiko amin'ny fomba hafa.
After two months, no one knows where he is.	Rehefa afaka roa volana dia tsy misy mahalala ny misy azy.
He should be about 50.	Tokony ho 50 eo ho eo izy.
He did not ask for such a thing.	Tsy nangataka zavatra toy izany izy.
And nothing else.	Ary tsy misy hafa.
I think he is still asleep.	Heveriko fa mbola matory izy.
The future seems clear.	Toa mazava ho azy ny ho avy.
It doesn’t have to be a good thing.	Tsy voatery ho zavatra tsara izany.
He is very small.	Kely dia kely izy.
He is not at home.	Tsy ao an-trano izy.
Pretty good.	Tsara tokoa.
It's not in his room.	Tsy ao amin'ny efitranony izany.
Already did.	Efa nanao izany.
They could be better.	Mety ho tsara kokoa izy ireo.
There is no such thing.	Tsy misy zavatra toy izany ao.
He just couldn’t leave.	Tsy afaka niala fotsiny izy.
We were able to find a way.	Afaka nahita fomba izahay.
But you are a different person.	Fa olona hafa ianao.
He had never met me like this.	Mbola tsy nihaona tamiko toy izao izy.
It may even help.	Mety hanampy mihitsy aza.
No one is stronger than him.	Tsy misy mahery noho izy.
Evil does it.	Ny ratsy no manao izany.
I think he might die.	Heveriko fa mety maty izy.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra izany.
I thought you were different.	Nihevitra aho fa hafa ianao.
So we don’t.	Ka tsy manao izany izahay.
We talk at length about this issue.	Miresaka lava be io olana io isika.
The water is very hard now.	Tena mafy ny rano ankehitriny.
He’s not very clear.	Tsy dia mazava loatra izy.
It was the only house he knew.	Io no hany trano fantany.
At the time, it was there.	Tamin'izany fotoana izany dia nisy izany.
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
Have you seen one before?	Efa nahita iray ve ianao taloha?
We were together every day.	Niaraka isan'andro izahay.
I was hoping for more.	Nanantena mafy kokoa aho.
I am angry.	Tezitra aho.
No need to worry about him.	Tsy mila manahy azy.
I enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra ahy izany.
It’s still there.	Mbola misy foana.
Everything will come out well in the end.	Ho tonga tsara daholo amin'ny farany.
This is because only other people have seen it.	Izany dia satria olona hafa ihany no nahita azy.
Otherwise, you don’t do it.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy manao izany ianao.
They have everything.	Manana ny zava-drehetra izy ireo.
He seemed happy.	Toa faly izy.
He will never live.	Tsy ho velona mihitsy izy.
I have to go there.	Tsy maintsy ho any aho.
Much more than that has happened.	Be lavitra noho izany no nitranga.
It will definitely be like a longer trip.	Azo antoka fa ho toy ny dia lavitra kokoa izany.
He did nothing wrong.	Tsy nanao ratsy izy.
It’s a very special car.	Tena fiara manokana izany.
There are.	Misy ny.
He never existed.	Tsy nisy mihitsy izy.
That should be true.	Tokony ho marina izany.
The last ones stayed.	Nijanona ihany ireo farany.
Others will not.	Ny hafa tsy hanao izany.
It’s a lot.	Be dia be izy io.
It was nothing at all.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona mihitsy izany.
Always now.	Foana izao.
Her room had no door.	Tsy nisy varavarana ny efitranony.
Of course, this is not entirely true.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy marina tanteraka izany.
And that’s good, actually.	Ary tsara izany, raha ny marina.
As much as you can.	Tahaka ny azonao atao.
He lost his job.	Very asa izy.
It was completely new.	Vaovao tanteraka ilay izy.
Maybe I can help.	Mety afaka manampy aho.
He saw something, for sure.	Nahita zavatra izy, azo antoka.
I never thought of that.	Tsy mbola nieritreritra an'izany mihitsy aho.
Right now, I’m the only one doing what I do.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia izaho ihany no manao ny ataoko.
They are just beautiful.	Tsara tarehy fotsiny izy ireo.
He is a morning man.	Olona maraina izy.
I’m sure he liked it.	Azoko antoka fa tiany izany.
He loved her, but she didn’t understand.	Tiany izy, nefa tsy azony.
Just now.	Amin'izao fotoana izao ihany.
I was so sick about them.	Narary mafy momba azy ireo aho.
But the distance is about the house.	Fa ny lavitra dia momba ny trano.
He just doesn’t understand it.	Tsy azony fotsiny izany.
When you are busy.	Rehefa sahirana ianao.
He arrived in about thirty minutes.	Tonga teo amin'ny telopolo minitra teo ho eo izy.
Don't believe him.	Aza mino azy.
It went well.	Nandeha tsara izany.
I really like this.	Tena tiako ity.
There were no women, anywhere.	Tsy nisy vehivavy, na taiza na taiza.
Or dinner.	Na koa ny sakafo hariva.
I need help with no.	Mila fanampiana aho amin'ny tsia.
The men were happy to see them happy.	Nahafinaritra ny lehilahy ny nahita azy ireo faly.
He refused to talk about what had happened.	Tsy nety niresaka momba ny zava-nitranga izy.
I can tell you what to do about it.	Afaka milaza aminao izay tokony hatao amin'izany aho.
It will not happen.	Tsy ho tanteraka izany.
He really loves us.	Tena tiany isika.
However, it is a good idea.	Na izany aza, hevitra tsara izany.
Everyone has the opportunity.	Samy manana ny fahafahana.
I need more.	Mila bebe kokoa aho.
It will not happen.	Tsy hitranga izany.
I'll be in the house in two minutes.	Hiditra ao an-trano aho afaka roa minitra.
Just crazy.	Adala fotsiny.
I need to think.	Mila mieritreritra aho.
Probably, today.	Mety ho, amin'izao andro izao.
They did it because they themselves wanted it.	Nanao izany izy ireo satria ny tenany ihany no naniry izany.
I shouldn’t be able to say that.	Tsy tokony ho afaka hilaza izany aho.
The first one came out.	Ny voalohany nivoaka.
He will never love you.	Tsy ho tia anao mihitsy izy.
I don’t know why you’re leaving the party.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana ianao no miala amin'ny fety.
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
It's not that hard.	Tsy hoe mafy loatra ilay izy.
I remember that.	Tadidiko izany.
They can do it.	Afaka manao izany izy ireo.
Hope to see him again soon !.	Manantena hahita azy indray tsy ho ela!.
They didn't see it.	Tsy nahita izany izy ireo.
No one spoke to him.	Tsy nisy niresaka taminy.
Two good years.	Roa taona tsara.
Not too long ago, though.	Tsy ela akory izay, na dia izany aza.
I would love to stay here again.	Tiako ny hijanona eto indray.
I always thought that.	Nieritreritra izany foana aho.
Not clear.	Tsy mazava.
There was a time and there was not a time.	Nisy ny fotoana ary tsy nisy ny fotoana.
But it was fun !.	Fa nahafinaritra!.
I don’t know anything about it.	Tsy haiko na inona na inona momba izany.
He is a very good man.	Tena lehilahy tsara izy.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Tsy haiko fotsiny ny manao izany.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Saingy toa tsy misy mahalala ny misy azy.
You will find things you can do better.	Hahita zavatra azonao atao tsara kokoa ianao.
He is the best.	Izy no tsara indrindra.
Don't sit here again and sleep.	Aza mipetraka eto indray ka matory.
Come here now.	Tonga eto izao.
If you’ve been here, you know.	Raha efa teto ianao dia fantatrao.
I should take you.	Izaho no tokony hitondra anao.
In fact, they have nothing.	Raha ny marina, tsy manana na inona na inona izy ireo.
I don’t see what caused them.	Tsy hitako izay nahatonga azy ireo.
I don't know how long.	Tsy haiko hoe hafiriana.
We will never convince him.	Tsy handresy lahatra azy mihitsy izahay.
Even bigger than that.	Lehibe noho izany aza.
I haven't heard of you yet.	Mbola tsy nandre momba anao aho.
And such words came.	Ary tonga ny teny toy izany.
He died.	Maty izy.
This is the problem.	Izao no olana.
No one loves him.	Tsy misy tia azy.
I'm not ready for that.	Tsy vonona amin'izany aho.
He saw nothing else about her.	Tsy nahita zavatra hafa momba azy izy.
I love these guys.	Tiako ireo lehilahy ireo.
Well, that's all.	Eny ary, izay ihany.
People he knows.	Olona fantany.
Of course, that should not be the case.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy tokony ho toy izany.
And we will continue to do so.	Ary mbola hanao izany izahay.
This is where you are.	Ity ny toerana misy anao.
There was another recently.	Nisy indray vao haingana.
We are waiting for news.	Miandry vaovao izahay.
He soon knew why.	Tsy ela dia fantany ny antony.
That's far.	Lavitra izany.
I saw them.	Hitako izy ireo.
That’s why they may not just be with you.	Izany no antony mety tsy eo aminao fotsiny izy ireo.
There is still time to do something.	Mbola misy fotoana hanaovana zavatra.
Or maybe because of that.	Na angamba noho izany.
He failed to do so.	Tsy nahavita izany izy.
I really like it.	Tena tiako izany.
Some thought he was incompetent.	Nisy nihevitra fa tsy nahay izy.
Don’t try to follow others.	Aza miezaka manaraka ny hafa.
We had never had that before.	Mbola tsy nanana an'izany mihitsy izahay taloha.
We can be anywhere.	Mety ho na aiza na aiza isika.
It’s still easy.	Mbola mora foana.
After a few minutes, he sat down and ate it all.	Rehefa afaka minitra vitsivitsy, dia nipetraka izy ary nihinana ny rehetra.
Because reason is not enough.	Satria tsy ampy ny antony.
He could watch the movie if he wanted to.	Afaka nijery ilay sarimihetsika izy raha tiany.
It took three years to complete the work.	Telo taona vao vita ny asa.
Marina.	Marina.
Spent the last month here.	Nandany ny volana farany teto.
Something will be done.	Hisy zavatra hatao.
I read the comments and decided on this one.	Namaky ny hevitra aho ary nanapa-kevitra momba ity iray ity.
And now you want to go home.	Ary ankehitriny ianao te hody.
You don’t say anything.	Tsy miteny na inona na inona ianao.
But no matter what, it won’t stop with you.	Saingy na inona na inona izany dia tsy hijanona aminao izany.
Maybe they will come.	Angamba ho avy izy ireo.
No, he will not enter again.	Tsia, tsy hiditra intsony izy.
I don't think that's true.	Heveriko fa tsy marina izany.
And it’s a lot of fun.	Ary mahafinaritra be.
It will not happen today.	Tsy hitranga izany anio.
Not all of us.	Tsy isika rehetra.
Reading a book.	Mamaky boky.
Of course, he didn't really want to see me.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy tena te hahita ahy izy.
Now when I do the work I don’t go.	Ankehitriny rehefa manao ny asa aho dia tsy mandeha.
However, it was as if they could have done nothing.	Na izany aza, dia toy ny hoe afaka nanao na inona na inona izy ireo.
I have no land.	Tsy manana tany aho.
He left the house.	Nivoaka ny trano izy.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Tsy maintsy mandeha miasa isika rahampitso.
You speak too fast.	Miteny haingana loatra ianao.
See you tomorrow.	Rahampitso indray.
I really want to help others.	Tena te hanampy ny hafa aho.
The little boy.	Ilay zaza kely.
There really is no other book like it.	Tena tsy misy boky hafa toy izany.
It was a long way off.	Lavitra be ilay izy.
I really like it.	Tena tiako ilay izy.
Then they left again.	Dia lasa indray izy ireo.
Of course, the truth is that nothing works for everyone.	Mazava ho azy fa ny marina dia tsy misy na inona na inona miasa ho an'ny rehetra.
There was definitely more to it.	Azo antoka fa nisy bebe kokoa tamin’izany.
No, not there.	Tsia, tsy any.
I always thought he was different.	Nihevitra foana aho fa hafa izy.
It doesn’t have to be that way.	Tsy voatery ho toy izany.
Here it is.	Ity ary izany.
Talking more,.	Miresaka bebe kokoa,.
He did a good job.	Nanao asa tsara izy.
I hope he doesn’t go.	Manantena aho fa tsy handeha izy.
I'm sorry I had to ask.	Miala tsiny aho fa tsy maintsy nanontany.
I think it is.	Heveriko fa izy io.
I thought it was okay.	Nieritreritra aho fa mety.
It can be months or even years.	Mety ho volana na taona mihitsy aza izany.
It’s like they could have done it or it wasn’t a big deal.	Toy ny hoe afaka nanao izany izy ireo na tsy olana lehibe izany.
I like that idea.	Tiako io hevitra io.
I think it’s more.	Heveriko fa bebe kokoa izany.
No more than two days.	Tsy mihoatra ny roa andro.
I like to drive.	Tiako ny mitondra fiara.
You are so wonderful.	Tena mahafinaritra ianao.
We used to really enjoy it.	Tena nahafinaritra anay izany taloha.
Love to find information.	Tia mitady vaovao.
And in fact, it’s not pretty.	Ary raha ny marina, dia tsy tsara tarehy.
He did not say why, but the reason is clear.	Tsy nilaza ny antony izy, fa ny antony dia mazava.
Work loves that.	Tia an'izany ny asa.
Especially these.	Indrindra ireo.
We talked about them.	Niresaka momba azy ireo izahay.
There are many reasons for this problem.	Misy antony maro io olana io.
That's too much.	Be loatra izany.
Everyone knows that.	Fantatry ny rehetra izany.
And he loves it.	Ary tiany izany.
I hope it will be done soon.	Manantena aho fa ho vita tsy ho ela.
He was grown up, still like a child.	Efa lehibe izy, mbola toy ny zaza ihany.
A lot of things happened today.	Maro ny zavatra nitranga androany.
He knew it would happen.	Fantany fa hitranga izany.
Here is the idea.	Eto ny hevitra.
I was very happy to be with him.	Tena faly aho niaraka taminy.
But, it just doesn’t work very well.	Saingy, tsy dia mandeha fotsiny ilay izy.
He refused.	Tsy nety izy.
I know you may be right.	Fantatro fa mety marina ny anao.
I always did.	Nanao izany foana aho.
You can join us !.	Afaka miaraka aminay ianao!.
You will soon meet him.	Tsy ho ela dia hihaona aminy ianao.
I'm free in the morning.	Afaka ny maraina aho.
So tell me the truth.	Koa lazao amiko ny marina.
I haven’t seen anything like it in years.	Tsy nahita zavatra toy izany aho nandritra ny taona maro.
He doesn’t have to look at her that way.	Tsy voatery hijery azy toy izany izy.
There are varieties.	Misy karazana.
But there are the above.	Saingy misy ny ambony.
I’m not sure if this is the best idea or not.	Tsy azoko antoka raha io no hevitra tsara indrindra na tsia.
The children were playing outside.	Nilalao tany ivelany ny ankizy.
Happy to help.	Faly fa afaka manampy.
He was afraid of me.	Natahotra ahy izy.
No day is too long.	Tsy misy andro lava be.
We were lucky to be free in the first place.	Tsara vintana izahay fa afaka tamin'ny voalohany.
And thank you.	Ary misaotra anao.
I really have to see that.	Tena tsy maintsy mahita izany aho.
He was just sick.	Narary fotsiny izy.
I'm not sure what can be done.	Tsy azoko antoka izay azo atao.
It’s kind of a fast track.	Karazana lalana haingana izy io.
People are the same everywhere and we are all the same.	Mitovy ny olona na aiza na aiza ary mitovy amin'ny rehetra isika.
I will be here though.	Ho eto aho na dia misy aza izany.
It was a wonderful story.	Tantara mahafinaritra ilay izy.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Nilaza izy fa tsy mahalala na inona na inona momba izany.
I know it's early morning, but we have to go.	Fantatro fa vao maraina izao, fa tsy maintsy mandeha isika.
He doesn't need it.	Tsy mila izany izy.
Well, here we are.	Eny ary, eto isika.
Not too many people know.	Tsy dia be loatra ny olona mahalala.
And he could have done it.	Ary afaka nanao izany izy.
One time.	Indray mandeha.
Then, if you’re lucky, you might find one.	Avy eo, raha tsara vintana ianao, dia mety hahita iray.
They were tough months.	Volana mafy izy ireo.
If you want.	Raha tianao.
Then he wasn't sure.	Dia tsy azony antoka.
They shouldn’t do that.	Tsy tokony hanao izany izy ireo.
I would love to talk to you today while you are there.	Tiako ny miresaka aminao anio raha eo ianao.
You learn what to do or what not to do.	Mianatra izay tokony hatao ianao, na izay tsy tokony hatao.
Any problem is the same.	Izay olana rehetra dia izay ihany.
He was surprised, at first, and of course happy.	Gaga izy, tamin'ny voalohany, ary mazava ho azy fa faly.
He did it.	Nahavita izany izy.
I read music.	Mamaky mozika aho.
That's where it is.	Izany no misy azy.
He went for it.	Nandeha ho azy izy.
He cannot die.	Tsy mety maty izy.
He doesn't understand.	Tsy azony.

Of course it does.	Mazava ho azy fa manao izany.
They are really good guys who work hard for you.	Lehilahy tena tsara izy ireo izay miasa mafy ho anao.
I'm happy now.	Faly aho izao.
I have to stay with two.	Tsy maintsy mijanona amin'ny roa aho.
And so are women.	Ary toy izany koa ny vehivavy.
I have many more, if you want to see them at once.	Manana maro hafa aho, raha tianao ny hahita azy ireo indray mandeha.
She loves to help.	Tia manampy izy.
I have never seen anything done like that.	Tsy mbola nahita na inona na inona aho nanao toy izany.
He is still a child.	Mbola zaza izy.
He was afraid of me.	Natahotra ahy izy.
He sat down.	Nipetraka izy.
Time passed quickly.	Nandeha haingana ny fotoana.
That may be true.	Mety ho marina izany.
I'm waiting for him to say something.	Miandry azy hilaza zavatra aho.
At first he saw nothing.	Tamin'ny voalohany dia tsy nahita na inona na inona izy.
He was a wonderful person and for many.	Olona nahafinaritra izy ary ho an’ny maro.
That, and thank you.	Izany, ary misaotra.
It’s really hard.	Tena sarotra izany.
There was, someone was with him.	Nisy, nisy olona niaraka taminy.
No one should have been in the end.	Tsy nisy olona tokony ho tao amin'ny farany.
It has always worked well until recently.	Niasa tsara foana hatramin'ny vao haingana.
I don’t have to remember them right now.	Tsy tokony ho tadidiko izy ireo amin'izao fotoana izao.
I don't think that's okay.	Heveriko fa tsy maninona izany.
That’s great.	Lehibe izany.
We will walk but it will only take about an hour.	Handeha lalana izahay fa adiny iray eo ho eo ihany.
Otherwise, it’s my fault.	Raha tsy izany dia ho ahy ny fahadisoana.
This is a real mistake.	Fahadisoana marina izany.
Some might say that is wrong.	Mety hisy hilaza fa tsy mety izany.
He can't know anything about it.	Tsy afaka mahalala na inona na inona momba izany izy.
That seems to be a problem for me.	Toa manana olana amiko izany.
He did not see.	Tsy nahita izy.
They have been here too long.	Efa ela loatra izy ireo no teto.
But one day when they had done everything.	Saingy indray andro rehefa nahavita ny zava-drehetra izy ireo.
So don’t talk about it.	Koa aza miresaka momba izany.
They arrived in the morning.	Tonga izy ireo ny maraina.
I'm going home.	Mody aho.
I hope so.	Manantena aho fa izany tokoa.
But night has come.	Fa tonga ny alina.
No more words on that.	Tsy misy teny intsony momba izany.
He is a different person now.	Olona hafa izy ankehitriny.
In fact, this is not a bad idea.	Raha ny marina, tsy hevitra ratsy izany.
No one said anything about them.	Tsy nisy niteny momba azy ireo.
Don’t leave us alone.	Aza avela ho irery izahay.
No one cares what you think.	Tsy misy miraharaha izay hevitrao.

He became a person because of others, not because of them.	Lasa olona izy noho ny hafa, fa tsy noho izy ireo.
He must have been terrified, but he was still young.	Tsy maintsy ho natahotra be izy, fa mbola kely.
We definitely got it.	Azo antoka fa nahazo izany izahay.

In fact, she doesn’t like men.	Raha ny marina dia tsy tia lehilahy izy.
The end has finally come.	Tonga ihany ny farany.
I’ve never really done that of course.	Tsy mbola tena nanao izany mihitsy aho mazava ho azy.
You said that.	Nilaza izany ianao.
The only other danger.	Ny loza hafa ihany.
It’s kind of a mistake.	Karazana fahadisoana izany.

What made you come like this?	Inona no nahatonga anao ho tonga toy izao?
In others, no.	Amin'ny hafa, tsy.

In this.	Amin'ity.
He wants you to go see him.	Tiany handeha hijery azy ianao.

I don't believe them.	Tsy mino azy ireo aho.
Everyone wanted it.	Naniry izany ny rehetra.
He is not a morning person.	Tsy olona maraina izy.
Sure, that’s often the case for me.	Azo antoka fa matetika ho ahy izany.
Not so.	Tsy toy izany.
He did not return.	Tsy niverina izy.
He entered.	Niditra izy.
It’s like going home.	Toy ny hoe mody.
But it’s not a job.	Saingy tsy asa izany.

I think it's too late.	Heveriko fa efa tara loatra.
But how was it.	Saingy nanao ahoana izany.
I just have to stop.	Tsy maintsy mijanona fotsiny aho.
Are you with us ?.	Miaraka aminay ve ianao?.
So it shouldn’t be a problem anywhere to do that.	Ka tsy tokony ho olana na aiza na aiza no hanaovana izany.

That would never have happened.	Tsy ho nitranga mihitsy izany.

They seem really angry.	Toa tezitra tokoa izy ireo.
Or maybe not.	Na angamba tsy izany.

He will go home.	Hody any an-trano izy.
It will come out.	Hivoaka io.
You will learn by doing.	Hianatra amin'ny fanaovana ianao.
He had to exist to survive.	Tsy maintsy nisy izy mba ho velona.
To me, there are no friends.	Amiko dia tsy misy namana.
Not a little if.	Tsy kely raha.
Because we haven’t done anything yet.	Satria mbola tsy nanao na inona na inona izahay.
I know where he is all the time.	Fantatro ny toerana misy azy mandritra ny fotoana rehetra.
I have a lot to do.	Betsaka ny tokony hataoko.
But that's the old one.	Fa izay ilay taloha.
He never told me who.	Tsy nilaza tamiko mihitsy izy hoe iza.
Yes, you are wrong.	Eny, diso ianao.
That's enough.	Ampy izay ary.
You need to find him but there.	Mila mitady azy ianao fa ao.
I was too scared.	Natahotra loatra aho.
She is a very good woman.	Vehivavy tena tsara izy.
Not today, not next week, but on the road.	Tsy androany, tsy amin'ny herinandro ho avy, fa amin'ny lalana.
I have to work a little now.	Tsy maintsy miasa kely aho izao.
It was a wonderful place.	Toerana mahafinaritra ilay izy.
He was the only one who died.	Izy ihany no maty.
And now, of course, that path is wrong.	Ary ankehitriny, mazava ho azy fa diso io lalana io.
They can speak for themselves.	Afaka miteny ho azy izy ireo.
I should have thought that too.	Tokony ho nieritreritra izany koa aho.
Maybe you don’t know that.	Angamba tsy fantatrao izany.
He spoke.	Izy no niteny.
The police finally arrived.	Tonga ihany ny polisy.
Lots of books all the time.	Be dia be ny boky amin'ny fotoana rehetra.
And he knew they would.	Ary fantany fa hanao izany izy ireo.
He immediately left the house.	Nivoaka avy hatrany ny trano izy.
Angry at women.	Tezitra amin'ny vehivavy.
I looked at it.	Nijery izany aho.
He is going well.	Mandeha tsara izy.

I haven’t been, not really.	Tsy mbola nisy aho, tsy tena.
No, it's okay.	Tsia, tsy ahoana.
That's right, if you just watched.	Izany no marina, raha mba nijery fotsiny ianao.
Some even die.	Misy aza maty.
I read and read and read.	Namaky sy namaky ary namaky aho.
Some think he is still alive.	Misy mihevitra fa mbola velona izy.
I think that’s a good thing.	Heveriko fa zavatra tsara izany.
This story may be true.	Mety ho marina io tantara io.
Maybe so.	Mety ho izany angamba.
And they went in.	Dia niditra izy ireo.
This has been a book for many years.	Ity dia boky ho an'ny taona maro.
However, it is still in its infancy.	Na izany aza, dia mbola nanomboka.
Smaller than you.	Kely noho ianao.
I will never make such a mistake again.	Tsy hanao fahadisoana toy izany intsony aho.
Men can say it.	Lehilahy afaka miteny io.
We just love to eat !.	Tia mihinana fotsiny izahay!.
It was as if they were waiting for something.	Toy ny hoe niandry zavatra izy ireo.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Ary tsy zavatra ratsy izany.
He has a lot to do.	Be dia be ny zavatra hataony.
The truth is different, and often more difficult.	Ny marina dia hafa, ary matetika sarotra kokoa.
He is a very good man.	Lehilahy tena tsara izy.
You don’t need that.	Tsy mila izany ianao.
I am the next person.	Izaho no olona manaraka.
This is the first.	Ity no voalohany.

Will definitely be back.	Azo antoka fa hiverina.
And he loves it.	Ary tiany izany.
This problem seems very complicated.	Toa sarotra be io olana io.
I didn’t think to do that.	Tsy nieritreritra ny hanao izany aho.
She is beautiful.	Tsara tarehy izy.
It’s hard, too.	Mafy ihany koa.
But he likes it there.	Fa tiany any.
He was the only one who did not.	Izy irery no tsy nanao izany.
You are so much better than that.	Tsara lavitra noho izany ianao.
In that way.	Amin'izany fomba izany.
I must go.	Tsy maintsy mandeha aho.
It took a little longer.	Nila kely ilay izy.
We're just going to watch a movie!	Hijery sarimihetsika ihany izahay!
It is too early.	Mbola aloha be izao.
They are not.	Tsy izy ireo.
He could have said that to all the girls.	Afaka nilaza izany tamin’ny tovovavy rehetra izy.
And he.	Ary izy.
Then the story goes.	Dia mandeha ny tantara.
He will never return.	Tsy hiverina intsony izy.
The room was full of beautiful people.	Feno olona tsara tarehy ilay efitrano.
Everything can go wrong.	Mety ho diso daholo ny zava-drehetra.
It started coming back to him.	Nanomboka niverina taminy izany.
There has never been such a thing, and there has never been such a thing.	Tsy mbola nisy toy izany, ary tsy nisy toy izany.
I don't speak anymore.	Tsy miteny intsony aho.
The police are very full.	Ny polisy dia tena feno tanteraka.
He was expecting trouble.	Nanantena olana izy.
She thought of her children.	Nieritreritra ny zanany izy.
It didn't seem real.	Toa tsy tena nisy ilay izy.
It doesn't work.	Tsy mandeha izany.
It’s so nice to see you again.	Tena mahafinaritra ny mahita anao indray.
If you think.	Raha mieritreritra ianao .
It’s really no different.	Tena tsy misy hafa amin'izany.
We did it once.	Indray mandeha izahay no nanao izany.
And there are other places.	Ary misy toerana hafa.
Like everything about this place.	Toy ny zava-drehetra momba ity toerana ity.
Yes, everything is real.	Eny, tena misy ny zava-drehetra.
He never called.	Tsy niantso mihitsy izy.
That and thank you.	Izany ary misaotra anao.
They don't have to think about it.	Tsy mila mieritreritra an’izany izy ireo.
He seemed to be everywhere.	Toa teny rehetra teny izy.
The food is bad.	Ratsy ny sakafo.
I like things.	Tiako ny zavatra.
But that is still not true nonetheless.	Saingy mbola tsy marina izany na izany aza.
I'm still young.	Mbola kely aho.
I thought they loved me.	Noheveriko fa tia ahy izy ireo.
It was just something that happened.	Zavatra nitranga ihany io.
We want to be with you.	Te hiaraka aminao izahay.
We won’t talk about that.	Tsy hiresaka momba izany isika.
I won't even talk to you tomorrow.	Tsy hiresaka aminao akory aho rahampitso.
But he did not ask to enter.	Saingy tsy nangataka ny hiditra tao izy.
Someone was waiting for us to leave.	Nisy olona niandry anay hivoaka.
He thought it was a good way.	Nihevitra izy fa fomba tsara izany.
That’s it, this is a great opportunity for him.	Izany no izy, ity no vintana lehibe ho azy.
That is for sure.	Azo antoka izany.
For the first few days he ate nothing.	Nandritra ny andro vitsivitsy voalohany dia tsy nihinana na inona na inona izy.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra ilay izy.
So we had a lot of fun.	Dia nahafinaritra be izahay.
He needed it fast.	Nila haingana izy.
But it has to.	Saingy tsy maintsy.
They may even know more than we do.	Mety mahafantatra bebe kokoa noho isika aza izy ireo.
Maybe again.	Angamba indray.
Not who we are.	Tsy hoe iza isika.
There will be a last time, a last time.	Hisy fotoana farany, fotoana farany.
He is already suspicious of you.	Efa miahiahy anao izy.
That can't happen.	Tsy mety hitranga izany.
I was scared for him and for me.	Natahotra ho azy sy ho ahy aho.
They could have done it.	Afaka nanao izany izy ireo.

This is crazy.	Adala izany.
Samy.	Samy.
Or is he ?.	Sa izy?.
He cannot do evil.	Tsy afaka manao ratsy izy.
There are many reasons for this.	Antony maro no nahatonga izany.
He was still staring at her.	Mbola nijery azy izy.
Today he left work early.	Androany dia niala niasa aloha izy.
I thought quickly.	Nieritreritra haingana aho.
I don’t understand why no one did that.	Tsy azoko hoe nahoana no tsy nisy olona nanao izany.
Then he will go.	Dia handeha izy.
This is true in two ways.	Marina amin'ny fomba roa izany.
Don’t leave that to you.	Aza avela ho anao izany.
The baby is fine.	Tsara ilay zaza.
There was nothing here.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona teto.
The question is very specific.	Tena manokana ny fanontaniana.
I think of you too.	Mieritreritra anao koa aho.
The latter is easily accessible.	Ity farany dia mora azo.
Or should they.	Na tokony ho izy ireo.

This is the best year for me.	Ity no taona tsara indrindra ho ahy.
You have received great help.	Nahazo fanampiana lehibe ianao.

No one planned anymore.	Tsy nisy nikasa intsony.
I was waiting for that.	Niandry izany aho.
Time flies.	Mandeha haingana ny fotoana.
You just don’t know.	Tsy fantatrao fotsiny.
This place could have been his.	Nety ho azy io toerana io.
I'm not afraid of him.	Tsy matahotra azy aho.
I sleep instead.	Matory kosa aho.
He waited another week, he decided.	Niandry herinandro hafa izy, nanapa-kevitra izy.

He was never sick.	Tsy narary mihitsy izy.
I don’t know what could have happened.	Tsy fantatro izay mety hitranga.
He tried it again and the same thing happened.	Nanandrana izany indray izy ary toy izany koa no nitranga.
He looked away, but he thought better.	Nijery lavitra izy, nefa nieritreritra tsara kokoa.

He’s a lot.	Be dia be izy.

Which to me is very unclear.	Izay amiko dia tena tsy mazava.
He went in there.	Niditra tao izy.
They probably won’t.	Azo inoana fa tsy hanao izany izy ireo.

The truth has been waiting for it.	Ny marina dia efa niandry izany.
Or something like that.	Na zavatra toy izany.

In fact, it is even easier to find now than ever before.	Raha ny marina, dia mbola mora kokoa ny mahita ankehitriny noho ny teo aloha.
No one does that.	Tsy misy manao izany.
I've been here too long.	Efa ela loatra aho no teto.
If you are a real person? 	Raha olona marina ianao?
There he was.	Teo no nisy azy.
Everything he wanted became gone.	Lasa daholo izay tiany.
Of course, this may be possible.	Mazava ho azy fa mety ho azo atao izany.

But I can't.	Saingy tsy afaka ary.

I'm not doing anything.	Tsy manao na inona na inona aho.

They got a lot of things.	Nahazo zavatra be dia be izy ireo.
Seems lucky.	Toa very vintana.
I was so scared.	Natahotra mafy aho.
They don’t care about everything.	Tsy miraharaha ny zava-drehetra izy ireo.

He didn't know who he was.	Tsy fantany hoe iza izy.
The question is not to give space to them but in what way.	Ny fanontaniana dia tsy ny hanome toerana ho azy ireo fa amin'ny fomba ahoana.
Without it, they cannot function.	Raha tsy misy izany dia tsy afaka miasa izy ireo.

They really look at the man.	Tena mijery ilay lehilahy izy ireo.
But he works for me.	Fa miasa amiko izy.
You’re here now so it’s okay to let go.	Efa eto ianao izao ka tsy maninona raha avela.
Everyone knows him.	Fantatry ny rehetra izy.
Without me, there is something wrong with this picture.	Raha tsy misy ahy dia misy zavatra tsy mety amin'ity sary ity.
Is he with friends?	Miaraka amin'ny namana ve izy?
I'm really busy.	Tena sahirana aho.

He is my favorite person.	Izy no olona tiako indrindra.
I don't remember when.	Tsy tadidiko hoe oviana.
And they’re pretty lucky.	Ary somary tsara vintana izy ireo.
Or so it should be.	Na izany no tokony ho izy.
That’s a problem, but good.	Olana izany, fa tsara.
In fact, he already existed.	Raha ny marina, efa nisy izy.

She watched him walk.	Nijery azy nandeha izy.

Then looked closely.	Dia nijery akaiky.
We are good men.	Isika no lehilahy tsara.
The same is true of us.	Toy izany koa ny momba antsika.
No one came.	Tsy misy tonga.

This is the last one.	Ity no farany.
However, they are gone.	Na izany aza dia lasa izy ireo.
They are still working.	Mbola miasa izy ireo.
They don’t come here to do that.	Tsy tonga eto izy ireo hanao izany.

I think he’s talking to everyone.	Heveriko fa miresaka amin'ny rehetra izy.
But it doesn’t have to be you.	Saingy tsy voatery ho ianao.

And it becomes easier and easier every day.	Ary lasa mora kokoa sy mora kokoa isan'andro.
Let them go.	Aleo izy ireo handeha.

I'm sure they are.	Azoko antoka fa izy ireo.
I sleep a lot.	Matory be aho.
From others.	Avy amin'ny hafa.

I was very lucky.	Tena tsara vintana aho.
It is late in the day.	Efa hariva ny andro.

If so, that’s a good idea.	Raha izany no izy dia hevitra tsara izany.
In the picture, it might be good, but it’s not.	Ao amin'ny sary dia mety ho tsara izy io, saingy tsy izany.

What will be, be.	Inona no ho, ho.
In the end, they didn't help much.	Tsy dia nanampy firy izy ireo tamin’ny farany.

Not too much.	Tsy dia be loatra.
I don’t think he did it wrong.	Heveriko fa tsy diso izy nanao izany.

Did he think when he started it would be like this.	Nieritreritra ve izy rehefa nanomboka dia ho toy izao.
Even if the weather is bad.	Na dia ratsy aza ny andro.
Our next.	Ny antsika manaraka.
They talked about good times.	Niresaka momba ny fotoana tsara izy ireo.
I know it seems hard to believe, but it is plausible.	Fantatro fa toa sarotra inoana izany, saingy azo inoana izany.
I spent a little time.	Nandany fotoana kely aho.
Everything is fine, everything is fine.	Tsara ny zava-drehetra, tsara ny zava-drehetra.
I had never heard of it.	Mbola tsy nandre izany mihitsy aho.
There is no good reason.	Tsy misy antony mety.
Or, the car could be a problem.	Na, mety ho olana ny fiara.
It’s all play.	Milalao daholo izany.
She really wants to be with him.	Tena te hiaraka aminy izy.
That is for sure.	Azo antoka izany.
They didn’t seem to be before.	Toa tsy teo aloha izy ireo.
He didn't need to be with her.	Tsy nila niaraka taminy izy.
It’s not like work.	Tsy toy ny asa izany.
But they are just stories.	Saingy tantara fotsiny izy ireo.
Is that so.	Izany ve.
Really lost here.	Tena very eto.
But it presented the same problem.	Saingy nanome io olana io ihany.
I think you will be happy to see it.	Heveriko fa ho faly ianao hahita azy.
We did it.	Nanao azy izahay.
Everyone seemed to be waiting for it.	Toa efa niandry an'io daholo ny rehetra.
And they have worked.	Ary efa niasa izy ireo.
He doesn’t care how old he is.	Tsy miraharaha firy taona izy.
He heard without hearing.	Nandre tsy nandre izy.
You read this right.	Mamaky ity marina ianao.
So do.	Na te hanao.
He used to be very hard on himself.	Tena mafy tamin'ny tenany izy taloha.
These girls are not allowed.	Tsy azo atao ireo tovovavy ireo.
Don’t leave it to chance.	Aza avela ho an'ny vintana.
, when they slept.	, rehefa natory izy ireo.
He couldn’t get it fast.	Tsy afaka nahazo azy haingana izy.
I really like him thank you so much !!.	Tena tiako izy misaotra betsaka!!.
They are not necessary.	Tsy ilaina izy ireo.
Of course, we cannot do such a thing.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka manao zavatra toy izany isika.
But you can do them.	Fa azonao atao ny manao azy ireo.
I can work on that.	Afaka miasa amin'izany aho.
He sat down.	Nipetraka izy.
They also talked about their favorite movies.	Niresaka momba ny sarimihetsika tiany koa izy ireo.
That might be a good thing to do.	Mety ho zavatra tsara atao izany.
I really hope you understand me without asking anything.	Tena manantena aho fa ho azonao aho raha tsy manontany na inona na inona.
We started talking.	Nanomboka niresaka izahay.
I am a grown woman.	Vehivavy lehibe aho.
Nowadays, don’t ask players.	Amin'izao andro izao, aza manontany ny mpilalao.
Everything is gone.	Lasa ny zava-drehetra.
That’s a really good idea.	Tena hevitra tsara izany.
They never work.	Tsy miasa mihitsy izy ireo.
Same as two years ago.	Mitovy amin'ny roa taona lasa.
However, he immediately apologized.	Na izany aza dia niala tsiny avy hatrany izy.
Yes, not really.	Eny, tsy izany tokoa.
It's not too big.	Tsy dia lehibe loatra izany.
He talked about his children.	Niresaka momba ny zanany izy.
I've seen him.	Efa nahita azy aho.
When eating.	Rehefa mihinana.
Are you male or female?	Lehilahy ve ianao sa vehivavy?
Some even did.	Nisy aza nanao izany.
In fact, he has no room.	Raha ny marina dia tsy misy ny efitranony.
Then we stopped.	Dia nijanona izahay.
He once did it himself.	Indray mandeha izy no nanao ny tenany.
Yes, something happened.	Eny, nisy zavatra nitranga.
Yes, it is.	Eny tokoa izany.
Or, you can do it.	Na, azonao atao izany.
The child got a good idea.	Nahazo hevitra tsara ilay ankizy.
No one is outside.	Tsy misy olona any ivelany.
Maybe that will help me overcome it.	Angamba hanampy ahy handresy azy izany.
i am lucky	tsara vintana aho.
I think you did.	Heveriko fa nanao izany ianao.
I haven't seen you yet.	Tsy mbola nahita anao aho.
All the music you want, at the time you want and in the place you want.	Ny mozika rehetra tianao, amin'ny fotoana tianao sy amin'ny toerana tianao.
It was as if he didn't really know what he was doing.	Toy ny hoe tsy fantany tsara izay nataony.
Finally it came to him.	Farany dia tonga taminy izany.
But now it's gone.	Fa lasa izao.
Good and top notch.	Tsara sy hevitra ambony.
They are big, we are small.	Lehibe izy ireo, kely izahay.
No one saw him.	Tsy nisy nahita azy.
That’s good, but not so good if you don’t have a car.	Tsara izany, fa tsy dia tsara loatra raha tsy manana fiara ianao.
No more than that.	Tsy mihoatra izany.
He looked up immediately.	Nijery avy hatrany izy.
I saw it today.	Hitako izany androany.
He thought they were dead.	Nihevitra izy fa maty izy ireo.
It’s hard to be superior.	Sarotra ny ho ambony.
He seems new and very useful.	Toa vaovao sy tena ilaina izy.
He couldn't even speak.	Tsy afaka niresaka akory izy.
I stopped there today to take a closer look.	Nijanona teo aho androany mba hijery akaiky.
It finally came.	Tonga ihany ilay izy.
I won’t talk to you about it.	Tsy hiresaka aminao momba izany aho.
About the dog thing.	Momba ny zavatra alika.
He won't miss anything.	Tsy ho diso na inona na inona izy.
The food problem is huge.	Ny olana amin'ny sakafo dia lehibe.
He knew the day was not good.	Fantany fa tsy tsara ny andro.
It won't be long.	Tsy ho ela izany.
You really do.	Tena manao izany ianao.
He doesn’t care much about others.	Tsy dia miraharaha ny hafa izy.
You can do whatever you want.	Afaka manao izay tianao ianao.
That’s what’s to come of it.	Izany no ho avy amin'izany.
Yes, he is very good.	Eny, tena tsara izy.
I just didn’t do it.	Tsy nataoko fotsiny izany.
Of course, you could be wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa mety ho diso ianao.
He knew it, if anyone did.	Fantany izany, raha nisy nanao izany.
Children love them.	Tia azy ireo ny ankizy.
There has never been.	Tsy mbola nisy mihitsy.
The evening came.	Tonga ny hariva.
She's not sure what to do now.	Tsy azony antoka izay tokony hatao izao.
They never did anything.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona mihitsy izy ireo.
I think he left because he wanted to leave.	Heveriko fa niala izy satria te hiala.
I’m talking about kids.	Miresaka momba ny ankizy aho.
Are you ready?.	Vonona ve ianao?.
So, there you are.	Noho izany, eo ianao.
I called him, last month.	Niantso azy aho, tamin'ny volana lasa.
There is no clear reason.	Tsy misy antony mazava.
Good stuff here.	Zavatra tsara eto.
This is my favorite.	Io no tena tiako indrindra.
She is happy about that.	Faly amin’izany izy.
Whoever it is.	Na iza na iza.
Of course, they saw nothing.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy nahita na inona na inona izy ireo.
I am that woman.	Izaho io vehivavy io.
Why is a good question.	Nahoana no fanontaniana tsara.
It’s even worse if you’re driving.	Tena ratsy kokoa izany raha mitondra fiara ianao.
What is the problem? 	Inona no olana?
In fact, the place is already his.	Raha ny marina dia efa azy ny toerana.
Which has never happened before.	Izay mbola tsy nisy mihitsy teo aloha.
But he couldn’t think of a good enough story.	Saingy tsy afaka nieritreritra tantara ampy tsara izy.
I only met him once.	Indray mandeha ihany aho no nihaona taminy.
This is not good news.	Tsy vaovao tsara izany.
He could not ask.	Tsy afaka nanontany izy.
The reason is unclear.	Tsy mazava ny antony.
In fact, don’t do anything like that anymore.	Raha ny marina, aza manao zavatra toy izany intsony.
He asked clearly.	Nangataka mazava izy.
And I wonder why.	Ary manontany tena aho hoe nahoana.
It’s hard to say now.	Sarotra ny milaza izao.
It came to him now.	Tonga taminy izany ankehitriny.
I don't understand the question.	Tsy azoko ilay fanontaniana.
You need to learn to think of me once.	Mila mianatra mieritreritra ahy indray mandeha ianao.
I know you do.	Fantatro fa manao izany ianao.
I can’t say much about the story for obvious reasons.	Tsy afaka milaza be loatra momba ny tantara noho ny antony mazava.
I came to take you home.	Tonga hitondra anao hody aho.
I'm still thinking about you.	Mbola mieritreritra anao aho.
Don't go there.	Aza mandeha any.
She was waiting for him.	Niandry azy izy.
Called the meeting.	Niantso ny fivoriana.
Tell me what you like.	Lazao ahy izay tianao.
To me, that is not possible.	Amiko dia tsy azo atao izany.
Some get it, some don’t.	Misy mahazo azy, misy tsy mahazo.
She loves children.	Tia ankizy izy.
I don't know how.	Tsy haiko hoe ahoana.
When you get there, everything is the same as the picture.	Rehefa tonga teo ianao dia mitovy amin'ny sary ny zava-drehetra.
It's not too late.	Mbola tsy tara izao.
You can’t get away with that.	Tsy afaka miala amin'izany ianao.
And that's what happened.	Dia izay no nitranga.
We will be there.	Ho any isika.
It’s very appropriate.	Tena mety izany.
There it is.	Ao izany.
Not with these people.	Tsy miaraka amin'ireo olona ireo.
We are looking for a girl.	Mitady tovovavy iray izahay.
But it may not be.	Saingy mety tsy izany.
Maybe you don’t care whether you are alive or dead.	Angamba ianao tsy miraharaha na velona na maty.
You learn to see it.	Mianatra mahita izany ianao.
They can say anything.	Afaka miteny na inona na inona izy ireo.
There's something you don't know.	Misy zavatra tsy fantatrao.
Sorry that's true.	Miala tsiny fa marina izany.
That’s definitely bad.	Azo antoka fa ratsy izany.
Even disaster may not help him.	Na ny loza aza dia mety tsy hanampy azy.
I think they are a good thing.	Heveriko fa zavatra tsara izy ireo.
The least.	Ny kely indrindra.
There must be.	Tsy maintsy misy.
I remember all about it.	Tadidiko daholo ny momba izany.
I have to stop.	Tsy maintsy mijanona aho.
No words.	Tsy misy teny.
I have a question about things.	Manana fanontaniana momba ny zavatra aho.
I wrote a lot like him too.	Nanoratra betsaka toa azy koa aho.
Summer seems to have gone farther than ever.	Toa lasa lavitra noho ny teo aloha ny fahavaratra.
This is a big mistake.	Fahadisoana lehibe izany.
They’re just not wrong.	Tsy diso fotsiny izy ireo.
This dog is really good.	Tena tsara tokoa ity alika ity.
I just make them for me.	Ataoko ho ahy fotsiny izy ireo.
Two children died.	Ankizy roa no maty.
He will be back.	Mbola hiverina izy.
But a lot of money no.	Fa vola be no.
He is always there for me.	Eo foana izy ho ahy.
There was nothing wrong.	Tsy nisy tsy nety.
I tried to do something.	Niezaka nanao zavatra aho.
Don't believe them.	Aza mino azy ireo.
And he is more than right.	Ary mihoatra noho ny marina izy.
We can see it.	Afaka mahita azy isika.
And too early.	Ary aloha loatra.
First, it is not true.	Voalohany, tsy marina izany.
It is not necessary.	Tsy ilaina izany.
It certainly has the money.	Azo antoka fa manana ny vola izy io.
How old have you lived here?	Firy taona ianao no nipetraka teto?
I'm not going home.	Tsy hody aho.
I’m not saying it’s bad.	Tsy milaza aho hoe ratsy izany.
They will live.	Ho velona izy ireo.
Like me.	Toy ny hoe ahy.
He did not understand why he was there.	Tsy azony ny antony nahatonga azy teo.
John was afraid of losing his job.	Natahotra ny ho very asa i John.
That's how it should be.	Izany no tokony ho izy.
But there are still a few people about it.	Saingy mbola misy olona vitsivitsy momba izany.
Someone did it.	Olona iray no nanao izany.
I'm not leaving you.	Tsy miala aminao aho.
We’re moving fast on issues.	Mandeha haingana amin'ny olana izahay.
But you get nothing.	Saingy tsy mahazo na inona na inona.
Whoever does that is not the idea.	Na iza na iza manao izany dia tsy ny hevitra.
And not just ideas.	Ary tsy hevitra fotsiny.
What time is it?	Amin'ny firy izao?
You seem wrong.	Toa diso hevitra ianao.
Maybe there are a lot of reasons.	Angamba misy antony maro be.
He is too good for me.	Tsara loatra amiko izy.
I also don’t see what is needed.	Tsy hitako koa izay ilaina.
Especially with fresh water, or with unsafe water.	Indrindra fa amin'ny rano vaovao, na amin'ny rano tsy azony antoka.
I know it doesn’t matter.	Fantatro fa tsy maninona izany.
Immediately you need another question.	Avy hatrany dia mila fanontaniana hafa ianao.
You don’t quit your job.	Tsy miala amin'ny asa ianao.
That would be good.	Mety tsara izany.
I really don’t know which is best.	Tena tsy fantatro izay tsara indrindra.
The teacher was furious.	Tezitra be ilay mpampianatra.
He doesn’t ask about it.	Tsy manontany momba izany izy.
Books are okay, if you ask me.	Boky tsy maninona, raha manontany ahy ianao.
Then he left and he stopped.	Dia lasa izy ary nijanona izy.
I have two questions about that.	Manana fanontaniana roa momba izany aho.
And maybe so too.	Ary angamba izany ihany koa.
I like you more if you are a man.	Tiako kokoa ianao raha toa ianao ka lehilahy.
But not after work.	Fa tsy rehefa avy niasa.
It’s something that can or can’t be done.	Zavatra azo atao na tsy azo atao izany.
It’s very hard to imagine that.	Sarotra be ny mieritreritra an'io.
I called him and talked to him.	Niantso azy aho ary niresaka taminy.
People are there too.	Eo koa ny olona.
I think nothing can be done more than that.	Heveriko fa tsy misy azo atao mihoatra noho izany.
They can very well be done.	Mety ho vita tokoa izy ireo.
And if you haven’t heard of it, you’ll love it too.	Ary raha mbola tsy nandre izany ianao dia ho tianao koa.
It is not known whether this is true or not.	Tsy fantatra na marina izany na tsia.
That’s right, he seems happy, happy.	Izany no marina, toa faly izy, faly.
Time, it seems, is never enough.	Ny fotoana, toa tsy ampy mihitsy.
We must help them.	Tsy maintsy manampy azy ireo isika.
I had food and water.	Nanana sakafo sy rano aho.
They are not.	Tsy izy ireo.
Yes, they are.	Eny, izany no izy ireo.
If so, it is too late.	Raha izany no izy, dia efa tara loatra.
Maybe these don’t work.	Angamba tsy misy asa ireo.
One day he left and never came back.	Indray andro dia nandeha izy ary tsy niverina.
I really want to talk to you.	Tena te hiresaka aminao aho.
In the end.	Amin'ny farany.
But in other ways, it seemed worse.	Saingy tamin'ny fomba hafa dia toa ratsy kokoa izany.
He’s not leaving.	Tsy izy no miala.
She was scared.	Natahotra izy.
He was the first person to arrive.	Izy no olona tonga voalohany.
Whatever you want.	Na inona na inona tianao.
And he knew it.	Ary fantany izany.
The man worked.	Niasa ilay lehilahy.
Let’s do well, let’s do well.	Aleo atao tsara, aleo atao tsara.
As soon as he left, the trouble started again.	Vao lasa izy dia nanomboka indray ny olana.
Tell them to be ready to leave in an hour.	Lazao izy ireo mba ho vonona handeha afaka adiny iray.
He will come here.	Ho avy eto izy.
He is here and interested in work.	Eto izy ary liana amin'ny asa.
Maybe so too.	Angamba koa izany.
They will not come.	Tsy ho avy izy ireo.

You did the right thing.	Nanao ny tsara ianao.
It sounds really fun.	Toa tena mahafinaritra izany.
And once a week.	Ary indray mandeha herinandro.
Someone brought it to me.	Nisy nitondra azy teto amiko.
He was three.	Telo izy.
I need to go.	Mila mandeha aho.
The time.	Ny fotoana.
One of many.	Iray amin'ny maro.
More time.	Lehibe kokoa ny fotoana.
What is all this ?.	Inona izany rehetra izany?.
He is playing.	Milalao izy.
You are not used to it.	Tsy zatra izany ianao.
yes	eny.
To his surprise, he was not there.	Gaga izy fa tsy teo izy.
Did you enjoy the weekend?	Nahafinaritra ve ny faran'ny herinandro?
And this one was a lot of fun.	Ary ity iray ity dia nahafinaritra be.
There was no one in the room.	Tsy nisy olona tao amin'ny efi-trano.
Surely you have an idea.	Azo antoka fa manana hevitra ianao.
I remember reading about it, yes.	Tadidiko ny namaky momba izany, eny.
He is not the last.	Tsy izy no farany.
However, it doesn’t seem too bad.	Na izany aza dia toa tsy ratsy loatra.
That is what made him superior to all others.	Izany no nahatonga azy ho ambony noho ny hafa rehetra.
Of course, that won't happen.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy ho tonga amin’izany.
I know him well there.	Fantatro tsara izy any.
No one can have an idea about it.	Tsy misy afaka manana hevitra momba izany.
It just won’t happen.	Tsy hitranga fotsiny.
Very unclear.	Tena tsy mazava.
They are very good.	Tena tsara izy ireo.
I know it will never be enough.	Fantatro fa tsy ho ampy mihitsy izany.
I know what it is.	Fantatro hoe inona izany.
Of course, he doesn’t need much.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy mila zavatra betsaka izy.
And he did it again.	Dia nanao izany indray izy.
He soon became interested.	Tsy ela dia nanomboka liana izy.
She is tall and beautiful.	Lava sy tsara tarehy izy.
She has the man.	Manana ny lehilahy izy.
This danger could be anyone.	Mety ho na iza na iza io loza io.
I get it from the inside.	Azoko avy ao anaty.
Something has happened here recently.	Nisy zavatra nitranga teto vao haingana.
I really like them.	Tena tiako izy ireo.
I'm really sorry.	Tena miala tsiny aho.
I think you did a good job.	Heveriko fa nahavita asa tsara ianao.
I don’t see what could be wrong, really.	Tsy hitako izay mety ho diso, tena marina.
Also, the little ones go a long way.	Ary koa, ny kely dia mandeha lavitra.
We are ready to do it.	Vonona ny hanao izany izahay.
And what are they now.	Ary inona no misy azy ireo ankehitriny.
I think he is right.	Heveriko fa marina izy.
They were afraid of him.	Natahotra azy izy ireo.
Nothing really seems true.	Tsy misy marina toa marina.
I’m not going to do that, no matter what.	Tsy hanao izany aho, na inona na inona.
So there is a well -known problem.	Noho izany dia misy olana fantatra be.
We have to think of two ideas together.	Tsy maintsy mieritreritra hevitra roa miaraka isika.
They were less than two minutes away.	Tsy ampy roa minitra akory izy ireo.
I really want to meet him.	Tena tiako ny hihaona aminy.
This is a true story.	Tantara marina ity.
We have plenty of time before next time.	Manana fotoana betsaka isika alohan'ny fotoana manaraka.
If something seems too good to be true, it often is.	Raha toa ka misy zavatra toa tsara loatra ka tsy ho marina dia matetika izany.
Everyone should know by now.	Tokony ho fantatry ny rehetra izany amin’izao fotoana izao.
But worse than that.	Saingy ratsy kokoa noho izany.
He will be with her and win her heart.	Hiaraka aminy izy ary hahazo ny fony.
If not, don’t.	Raha tsy izany dia aza.
But if not, we have to go.	Fa raha tsy izany dia tokony handeha isika.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy.
Or not, until last night.	Na tsy nanao izany, hatramin’ny omaly hariva.
Doing things right.	Manao zavatra araka ny tokony ho izy.
It’s not fun anymore.	Tsy mahafinaritra intsony.
He died instantly.	Maty teo no ho eo izy.
Things really gave them a good job.	Tena nanome azy ireo asa tsara ny zavatra.
So you have to tell me what to do.	Noho izany dia tsy maintsy milaza amiko izay tokony hatao ianao.
That person, that child, is dead.	Efa maty io olona io, io zaza io.
There was a big party.	Nisy fety lehibe.
They are good.	Tsara izy ireo.
He did it as fast as the first.	Nanao izany haingana toy ny voalohany izy.
If everything went well.	Raha nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
You are asleep.	Matory ianao.
I don't know what time it is.	Tsy fantatro hoe amin'ny firy izao.
It's okay now.	Tsy maninona izy izao.
In fact, this is not really a problem.	Raha ny tena izy, dia tsy tena olana izany.
No work to do.	Tsy misy asa atao.
That is where we are today.	Izay no misy antsika amin'izao fotoana izao.
Do you want to come with me?	Te hiaraka amiko ve ianao?
There is something we are missing.	Misy zavatra tsy ampy antsika.
Or maybe not.	Sa tsy izany angamba.
What a beautiful thing for a beautiful reason.	Inona no zavatra tsara tarehy noho ny antony tsara tarehy.
It has already happened.	Efa nitranga izany.
Whatever it is.	Na inona na inona tena.
Then they were angry.	Dia tezitra izy ireo.
You will give a lot of things.	Hanome zavatra maro ianao.
That’s good of course.	Tsara izany mazava ho azy.
I'm sure something went wrong.	Azoko antoka fa nisy zavatra tsy nety.
They can do whatever they want.	Afaka manao izay tiany izy ireo.
Called him again.	Niantso azy indray.
I didn't say anything.	Tsy niteny na inona na inona aho.
No one was there.	Tsy nisy olona teo.
It looks like it should.	Toa toy ny tokony ho izy.
I could never do that now.	Tsy afaka nanao izany mihitsy aho izao.
Very uncertain.	Tena tsy azo antoka.
It was just something that happened.	Zavatra nitranga fotsiny izany.
Yes, you did well to read that.	Eny, tsara ny namaky izany ianao.
I can't do that.	Tsy vitako izany.
And he can’t be late in doing so.	Ary tsy mety tara amin'ny fanaovana izany izy.
It was fun to meet everyone.	Nahafinaritra ny nihaona tamin'ny rehetra.
Too much like one on one.	Be loatra toy ny iray amin'ny iray.
You are both with me.	Samy miaraka amiko ianareo.
There is no one to help you with that.	Tsy misy hanampy anao amin'izany.
He saw two.	Nahita roa izy.
No, don't apologize.	Tsia, aza miala tsiny.
Anyway, he stayed there.	Na ahoana na ahoana, dia nijanona teo izy.
She is in her room.	Ao amin'ny efitranony izy.
It goes to me.	Mandeha amiko izany.
I know where they are.	Fantatro ny toerana misy azy ireo.
He seemed to be waiting for me.	Toa niandry ahy izy.
My position is the same.	Mitovy amin'izany koa ny toerana misy ahy.
You can have it.	Afaka manana izany ianao.
I didn't see you there.	Tsy hitako teo ianao.
For the first two months it worked well.	Nandritra ny roa volana voalohany dia niasa tsara.
And a friend to all.	Ary namana ho an'ny rehetra.
I never stopped.	Tsy nijanona mihitsy aho.
No, that's not right.	Tsia, tsy mety izany.
Don't talk to me.	Aza miresaka amiko.
He said it was okay.	Nilaza izy fa mety izany.
Is he still angry with you?	Mbola tezitra aminao ve izy?
I recently made money.	Vao haingana aho no nahazo vola.
Instead, it found an opportunity.	Nahita fahafahana kosa izany.
Many say that nothing can be done.	Maro no milaza fa tsy misy azo atao.
The end has finally come.	Tonga ihany ny farany.
And it accomplished a lot.	Ary nahavita be.
I doubt he really loves me.	Misalasala aho fa tena tia ahy izy.
He must help us.	Tsy maintsy hanampy antsika izy.
Maybe he will.	Angamba izany no hataony.
They both have the same opportunities.	Samy manana fahafahana mitovy.
No problem again.	Tsy misy olana indray.
Everyone knows about them.	Fantatry ny rehetra ny momba azy ireo.
Not the police, not the police.	Tsy ny polisy, tsy ny polisy.
All of us.	Isika rehetra.
They are confused.	Very hevitra izy ireo.
I know it can be hard to get here.	Fantatro fa mety ho sarotra ny tonga eto.
You’re reading this, aren’t you?	Mamaky ity ianao, sa tsy izany?
He and she together.	Izy sy izy miaraka.
He got it.	Nahazo izany izy.
Especially if you work remotely.	Indrindra raha miasa lavitra ianao.
Many years.	Taona maro.
It’s not easy for me to do that.	Tsy mora amiko ny manao izany.
Not too long ago, perhaps, that day.	Tsy ela akory izay, angamba, io andro io.
But not everything.	Saingy tsy ny zava-drehetra.
You couldn't do that now.	Tsy afaka nanao izany ianao izao.
He really said that.	Tena nilaza izany izy.
They are and in him.	Izy ireo ary ao aminy.
What does it mean to have no home in this place.	Inona no atao hoe tsy manana trano amin'ity toerana ity.
I really need him.	Tena mila azy aho.
It was as if he wanted nothing.	Toy ny tsy naniry na inona na inona izy.
I’m wrong but I’m pretty sure.	Diso aho fa tena azo antoka.
I want to know that.	Tiako ho fantatra izany.
But there were many things.	Saingy nisy zavatra maro.
I don't want to be alone.	Tsy te ho irery aho.
They can do whatever they want with you.	Afaka manao izay tiany hatao aminao izy ireo.
He did it right away.	Nataony avy hatrany ilay izy.
Some children love to be alone.	Misy ankizy tia irery.
I haven't seen it yet.	Mbola tsy nahita an'io aho.
Saika.	Saika .
Something you don’t have to worry about.	Zavatra tsy mila manahy momba izany ianao.
Someone or something is watching.	Misy olona na zavatra mijery.
Playing with me.	Milalao miaraka amiko.
I will not be left alone here.	Tsy hijanona irery eto aho.
It helped a little.	Nanampy kely izany.
Often.	Matetika.
I just want to say.	Te hilaza fotsiny aho.
This is a bad practice.	Fomba ratsy izany.
He loved her.	Tiany izy.
And these problems are certainly present almost everywhere.	Ary azo antoka fa saika misy na aiza na aiza ireo olana ireo.
He went the other way with it.	Nandeha tamin'ny lalana hafa niaraka tamin'izany izy.
I will not be surprised.	Tsy ho gaga aho.
In any case, it is no longer known.	Na izany na tsy izany, tsy fantatra intsony.
Or, it seems.	Na, toa izany.
You have everything.	Manana ny zava-drehetra ianao.
Not my favorite of his, anyway.	Tsy ny tiako indrindra amin'ny azy, na ahoana na ahoana.
I want to talk to him today.	Te hiresaka aminy aho anio.
And it all seemed fun.	Ary toa nahafinaritra azy rehetra.
It’s just like that.	Toy izany ihany izy.
But, big question.	Fa, fanontaniana lehibe.
I know his children.	Fantatro ny zanany.
That's a really bad idea.	Tena hevitra ratsy izany.
That's what he did.	Izany no nataony.
This is very important.	Tena ilaina izany.
He left the room.	Nivoaka ny efitrano izy.
So we both see a little bit.	Ka samy mahita kely isika roa.
I used to love it.	Tiako izany taloha.
I hope it happens but you never know.	Manantena aho fa hitranga izany fa tsy fantatrao mihitsy.
It seems a little far -fetched.	Toa lavitra kely izany.
But his.	Fa ny azy .
Sounds good enough.	Toa ampy tsara.
Not him at all.	Tsy izy mihitsy.
Everyone is happy.	Faly ny rehetra.
That time was not like today.	Tsy toy ny androany izany fotoana izany.
I left the room.	Nivoaka ny efitrano aho.
I read more in the morning and evening than in the afternoon.	Mamaky bebe kokoa aho ny maraina sy ny hariva noho ny amin’ny tolakandro.
This is a rather difficult time for me.	Fotoana somary sahirana amiko izao.
Then it doesn’t work.	Dia tsy mandeha izany.
He needs more money.	Mila vola bebe kokoa izy.
Everyone thinks they know me.	Mihevitra ny rehetra fa mahafantatra ahy.
He needs these things.	Mila ireo zavatra ireo izy.
I can’t believe he works so fast.	Tsy mino aho fa miasa haingana be izy.
Yes, that's right.	Eny, izany indrindra.
And work harder.	Ary miasa bebe kokoa.
No, no, no.	Tsia, tsia, tsia.
But it could be the same.	Saingy mety ho toy izany koa.
he wondered.	nanontany tena izy.
We need to take you somewhere.	Mila mitondra anao any ho any izahay.
And in the first year.	Ary tamin'ny taona voalohany.
I'm worried something will happen to him.	Manahy aho fa hisy zavatra hitranga aminy.
He spent a lot of money.	Nandany vola be izy.
Whatever.	Na inona na inona.
In front, then above.	Eo aloha, avy eo ambony.
Real money.	Vola tena.
But, first, he asks you if you have an idea.	Saingy, voalohany, manontany anao izy hoe manana hevitra ve ianao.
For a long time they remained that way.	Nandritra ny fotoana ela izy ireo no nijanona toy izany.
We are very smart.	Tena mahay isika.
I’m not telling you what you are.	Tsy milaza aminao aho hoe inona ianao.
I hope you know everything.	Manantena aho fa fantatrao ny zava-drehetra.
It is not good for us to be together.	Tsy tsara ho antsika ny miaraka.
It’s a difficult process.	Fomba sarotra izany.
I just worked on this one.	Vao avy niasa ity iray ity aho.
He lived alone.	Nipetraka irery izy.
He would not know where he was.	Tsy ho fantany hoe taiza izy.
I'm still not sure.	Mbola tsy azoko antoka.
They looked at him like a fool.	Nijery azy toy ny olona adala izy ireo.
Of course, he loved books.	Mazava ho azy fa tena tia boky izy.
He didn't know who it was.	Tsy fantany hoe iza io.
I get nothing out of the thing.	Tsy mahazo na inona na inona avy amin'ilay zavatra aho.
Whatever happened, in that case.	Na inona no nitranga, raha ny amin'izany.
In the next hour he will be here.	Amin'ny ora manaraka dia ho tonga eto izy.
Both are incorrect.	Samy tsy marina.
He quickly fell asleep.	Lasa natory haingana izy.
That's not wrong.	Tsy tsiny izany.
He never wanted anyone to lose their job.	Tsy tiany hisy ho very asa mihitsy.
You have to see it.	Tsy maintsy mahita izany ianao.
I knew it was too fast.	Fantatro fa haingana loatra ilay izy.
Things are not like that.	Tsy toy izany ny zavatra.
Either way it works.	Na ny fomba iray dia miasa.
We must also look to the future.	Tsy maintsy mijery ny ho avy koa isika.
I just don’t know when that day will be.	Tsy fantatro fotsiny hoe rahoviana izany andro izany.
The last big is probably my favorite of all time.	Ny lehibe farany angamba no tiako indrindra amin'ny fotoana rehetra.
They are doing wrong.	Manao ratsy izy ireo.
I'm happy.	Faly aho.

Everything was the same.	Ny zava-drehetra dia toy ny teo ihany.

He thought it best to leave the other two alone.	Nihevitra izy fa aleo avela irery ny roa hafa.
I’m not a morning person, but this is my favorite time of the day.	Tsy olona maraina aho, fa io no fotoana tiako indrindra amin'ny andro.
So why didn't you write to me?	Koa nahoana ianao no tsy nanoratra tamiko?
Just bad.	Ratsy fotsiny.
Maybe more.	Mety ho bebe kokoa.
I have to thank him for that.	Tsy maintsy misaotra azy aho noho izany.

He seemed interested, though he said little.	Toa liana izy, na dia tsy niteny firy aza.

There may be a reason for this.	Misy antony angamba izany.
It was hard for him to hear.	Sarotra taminy ny nandre.
He heard someone enter the room.	Nandre olona niditra tao amin’ilay efitrano izy.
What else should I do here.	Inona koa no tokony hataoko eto.
You don’t like it.	Tsy tianao izany.
Everything really goes if it goes well.	Tena mandeha daholo ny zava-drehetra raha toa ka tsara.
There must be something wrong.	Tsy maintsy misy zavatra tsy mety.
In fact, it’s good, maybe even great.	Raha ny marina dia tsara izany, mety ho lehibe mihitsy aza.
The day must be night.	Tsy maintsy alina ny andro.
I also went to the top.	Nandeha tamin'ny farany ambony koa aho.
And, sooner or later, you will make mistakes.	Ary, na ho ela na ho haingana, dia hanao fahadisoana ianao.
I will not leave.	Tsy hiala aho.
It has been raining for the last two days.	Orana ny roa andro farany.
It seemed completely full.	Toa feno tanteraka ilay izy.
He had a book for me.	Nanana boky ho ahy izy.
They are still working.	Mbola miasa izy ireo.
Probably called him.	Azo inoana fa niantso azy.

It's all different now.	Hafa daholo izao.
These are the two biggest problems for me.	Ireo no tena olana roa lehibe indrindra amiko.
One man and two women.	Lehilahy iray sy vehivavy roa.
Maybe he got a picture that the child wasn’t his.	Angamba azony sary fa tsy azy ilay zaza.
Fun work, done every day.	Asa mahafinaritra, atao isan'andro.
He didn't add anything.	Tsy nanampy na inona na inona izy.
So are they.	Toy izany koa izy ireo.
He is coming.	Ho avy izy.
And you do, over and over again.	Ary manao izany ianao, hatrany hatrany hatrany.
He doesn't believe me.	Tsy mino ahy izy.
It will bring people.	Hitondra olona izany.
I think that’s true about it.	Heveriko fa marina ny momba izany.
You won’t just be out there!	Tsy ho any ivelany fotsiny ianao!
Then came the word.	Tonga avy eo ny teny.
It's raining today.	Avy ny orana androany.
I have to leave.	Tokony hiala aho.
The dog came to tell us.	Ilay alika no tonga nilaza taminay.
It seems like a mistake to me.	Toa fahadisoana izany amiko.
I have been working.	Efa niasa aho.
I don't care.	Tsy miraharaha aho.
I want to be with us again.	Tiako ny ho eo aminay indray.
I see two ways.	Mahita fomba roa aho.
I see why.	Hitako hoe nahoana.
Others, perhaps not so much.	Ny hafa, angamba tsy dia be loatra.
Whatever the reason, that’s why it happened.	Na inona na inona antony, izany no nahatonga azy.
I love everything about him.	Tiako daholo ny momba azy.
I’m not saying where, for good reason.	Tsy milaza aho hoe aiza, noho ny antony tsara.
It’s just like that.	Toy izany ihany izy.
I have to know.	Tsy maintsy fantatro.
Everything seems easy.	Toa mora ny zava-drehetra.
When together.	Rehefa miaraka.
The same thing applies with books.	Toy izany koa ny amin’ireo boky.
There aren’t too many people going around right now.	Tsy dia betsaka loatra ny olona mandeha amin'izao fotoana izao.
It looks good on you.	Mijery anao tsara izany.
Maybe something you’ve never done before.	Angamba zavatra mbola tsy nataonao mihitsy.
Could he be wrong.	Mety ho diso hevitra ve izy.

There was a man there, and only one man.	Nisy lehilahy iray tao, ary lehilahy iray ihany.

That’s the first thing.	Izany no zavatra voalohany.
And the former.	Ary ilay teo aloha.

What is your favorite book?	Inona no boky tianao indrindra?
Others seem to have this problem.	Toa manana izany olana izany ny hafa.
But there is another idea here.	Saingy misy hevitra hafa eto.
Or too fast to be immediate as well.	Na haingana loatra ka mety ho eo noho eo ihany koa.
In fact, he left her again.	Raha ny marina, dia niala taminy indray izy.
He gets nothing out of it.	Tsy mahazo na inona na inona amin’izany izy.
It should only be about three minutes.	Tokony ho telo minitra eo ho eo ihany izany.
One, two, many.	Iray, roa, maro.
Lots of people.	Betsaka ny olona.
If only he had told her.	Raha mba nilaza taminy izy.

What seems to be the problem? 	Toa inona no olana?
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Efa ela aho no tsy nahita azy.
Two men and two women.	Lehilahy roa sy vehivavy roa.
Then tell me what, if any, is not enough.	Dia lazao ahy izay, raha misy, tsy ampy.
I can’t do this job unless people stop.	Tsy vitako io asa io raha tsy mijanona ny olona.

Same idea.	Mitovy hevitra.
He just looked at her.	Nijery azy fotsiny izy.

It was a good book for me.	Boky tsara ho ahy ilay izy.
Everyone knows that.	Fantatry ny rehetra izany.

I think he only knew.	Heveriko fa fantany ihany.
Once again.	Indray mandeha indray.
Once you’ve seen them, you’ll want to see more and more.	Raha vao nahita azy ireo ianao dia te hahita bebe kokoa sy bebe kokoa.

He was glad he did.	Faly izy fa nanao izany izy.
So, we decided.	Noho izany, nanapa-kevitra izahay.
He was very sick inside.	Tena narary tao anaty izy.
But it has only just begun.	Fa vao nanomboka izany.
I have been waiting for thirty years.	Efa telopolo taona aho no niandry.
They bought a car, but it didn’t go well.	Nividy fiara izy ireo, saingy tsy nandeha tsara.
Not so now.	Tsy dia toy izany ankehitriny.
I have been waiting too long for this moment.	Efa ela loatra aho no niandry ity fotoana ity.
He never accomplished anything.	Tsy nahavita na inona na inona mihitsy izy.
I really need it.	Tena mila izany aho.
Very vague.	Tena tsy mazava loatra.

If we don’t stop.	Raha tsy mijanona isika.
They had a great time at the party.	Nanana fotoana tsara izy ireo tamin'ny fety.

For sure,	Azo antoka,
He seems very safe.	Toa azo antoka tokoa izy.

It was very different.	Tena hafa mihitsy ilay izy.
I don't want to leave you.	Tsy te hiala aminao aho.
And we will get help.	Ary hahazo fanampiana izahay.
He was a man who spoke from his heart.	Lehilahy niteny tamin’ny fony izy.

Enough breakfast.	Ampy ny sakafo maraina.
I can really talk to you.	Tena afaka miresaka aminao aho.
Thank you for coming here so quickly.	Misaotra anao tonga teto haingana.

He plays really well.	Milalao tena tsara izy.
He was never sick.	Tsy narary mihitsy izy.
If only a little.	Raha kely fotsiny.

That's all.	Izany rehetra izany.

I have to learn them from you.	Tsy maintsy mianatra azy ireo aminao aho.
You needed me.	Nila ahy ianao.
I have already said that here as well.	Efa nolazaiko teto koa izany.
So it’s probably not fun.	Ka azo atao fa tsy mahafinaritra.
However, you have other problems.	Na izany aza, manana olana hafa ianao.
I am a woman.	Vehivavy aho.
So we do what we can.	Noho izany dia manao araka izay azo atao izahay.
Do you want to be with me?	Te hiaraka aminao ve ianao?

This, not too much.	Ity, tsy dia be loatra.
When you get lucky, of course.	Rehefa mahazo vintana ianao, mazava ho azy.

I understand your point.	azoko ny hevitrao.
He loved it too.	Tiany koa ilay izy.
He started drinking too much.	Nanomboka nisotro be loatra izy.
Time passed.	Nandeha ny fotoana.
You can study these books this summer.	Azonao atao ny mianatra ireo boky ireo amin'ity fahavaratra ity.
Tell people what you did.	Lazao amin'ny olona ny zavatra nataonao.
In doing so, they share the same idea.	Amin'izany, dia mitovy amin'ny hevitra iray izy ireo.
I just went.	Nandeha fotsiny aho.
You better get out of here.	Aleo miala eto ianao.
We can get jobs.	Afaka mahazo asa isika.
This one is for me.	Ity iray ity ho ahy.
I thought it was you.	Noheveriko fa ianao io.
It was good to see that.	Tsara ny nahita izany.
Not enough money.	Tsy ampy ny vola.
No, in fact, this is not entirely true.	Tsia, raha ny marina, tsy marina tanteraka izany.
She was too scared.	Natahotra loatra izy.
A young woman lives alone in a small house.	Tovovavy iray no mipetraka irery ao amin'ny trano kely iray.
No need to think either.	Tsy mila mieritreritra koa.
I hope you are okay.	Manantena aho fa tsy maninona ianao.
Yes, you know the type.	Eny, fantatrao ny karazana.
I tried everything here with no luck.	Nanandrana ny zava-drehetra teto aho tsy nisy vintana.
It's been a long time coming.	Efa hatramin’ny taloha izany.
The good news.	Ny vaovao tsara.
It was a really nice little place.	Tena toerana kely tsara tarehy ilay izy.
It was a really good job.	Tena asa tsara ilay izy.
I looked again.	Nijery indray aho.
He came home.	Tonga tao an-trano izy.
The outside world doesn’t tell you anything.	Tsy milaza na inona na inona aminao ny any ivelany.
We believe that.	Mino izany izahay.
I was scared at first.	Natahotra aho tamin'ny voalohany.
A man died.	Lehilahy iray maty.
You will meet many new people there.	Hahita olona vaovao maro ianao any.
Any of us.	Na iza na iza taminay.
I disagree with that.	Tsy mitovy hevitra amin'izany aho.
We think that's okay.	Mihevitra izahay fa mety izany.
People know that.	Fantatry ny olona izany.
He’s not the type.	Tsy izy no karazana.
But he knew.	Fa fantany.
I finally made it.	Nahavita izany aho tamin'ny farany.
They can tell when you are different.	Afaka milaza izy ireo rehefa tsy mitovy ianao.
My next one may or may not.	Ny ahy manaraka dia mety na tsia.
He started drinking.	Nanomboka nisotro izy.
No, like he did, but he didn’t.	Tsia, tahaka ny nataony, fa tsy nanao izany.
It seems easier said than done.	Toa mora kokoa ny milaza izany.
He reads a little.	Kely mamaky teny izy.
But he shouldn't have done something I didn't know.	Nefa tsy tokony ho nanao zavatra tsy fantatro akory izy.
We can't stop.	Tsy afaka mijanona izahay.
I doubt it will be easy.	Misalasala aho fa ho mora izany.
Not done yet.	Mbola tsy vita akory.
And you have to be.	Ary tsy maintsy ho ianao.
He drank too much, too fast.	Nisotro be loatra izy, haingana loatra.
There are ways to do things.	Misy fomba hanaovana zavatra.
I had never met him.	Mbola tsy nihaona taminy mihitsy aho.
It all seems to have happened before.	Toa efa nisy izany rehetra izany teo aloha.
Both are impossible.	Tsy azo atao ny roa.
This one is not too close.	Tsy dia akaiky loatra ity iray ity.
I think you will do the same.	Heveriko fa hanao izany koa ianao.
It went well.	Nandeha tsara izy io.
Next week we will return to work.	Amin’ny herinandro ho avy izao dia hiverina amin’ny asa miandry isika.
There is no right path for everyone.	Tsy misy lalana marina ho an'ny rehetra.
Not all houses are occupied.	Tsy ny trano rehetra no mipetraka.
Yes, you need information.	Eny, mila vaovao ianao.
They are just like you.	Tahaka anao ihany izy ireo.
Got bad luck.	Nahazo vintana ratsy.
Every man can see it.	Afaka mahita izany ny lehilahy rehetra.
You never came back.	Tsy niverina intsony ianao.
Some even believe that we have reached that point now.	Misy aza mino fa tonga amin’izany fotoana izany isika ankehitriny.
Not enough money.	Tsy ampy ny vola.
You are not like that.	Tsy toy izany ianao.
This is not a problem for me.	Tsy olana amiko izany.
He can walk.	Afaka mandeha izy.
If you are lucky.	Raha tsara vintana ianao.
It is a good house.	Trano tsara izy io.
No one said it was necessary.	Tsy nisy nilaza fa ilaina izany.
This is absolutely true.	Marina tanteraka izany.
It is not there but there.	Tsy ao io fa ao.
It was difficult for him to talk to her.	Sarotra taminy ny niresaka taminy.
It didn’t matter, but they had to get there.	Tsy maninona na ahoana, fa tsy maintsy tonga tany izy ireo.
First, it’s not easy.	Voalohany, tsy mora izany.
I don’t like it either.	Tsy tiako koa.
They were not wrong.	Tsy diso izy ireo tamin’izany.
You know you like it.	Fantatrao fa tianao izany.
No music went on.	Tsy nisy mozika nandeha.
I think there may be something missing everywhere.	Mieritreritra aho hoe mety misy zavatra tsy ampy ny toerana rehetra.
The work is completely done.	Vita tanteraka ny asa.
Lots and lots.	Be dia be.
If you do.	Raha manao izany ianao.
They didn't even look at him.	Tsy nijery azy akory izy ireo.
Don't do that.	Aza manao izany.
We can go home.	Afaka mody izahay.
I'm not so sure.	Tsy dia azoko antoka loatra.
You need to think about it.	Mila mieritreritra an'izany ianao.
In fact, he never does.	Raha ny marina dia tsy manao izany mihitsy izy.
I know it can happen.	Fantatro fa mety hitranga izany.
They do things.	Manao zavatra izy ireo.
We are one people.	Olona iray isika.
But he is alive.	Saingy velona izy.
But it's me.	Fa izaho izany.
But I get it.	Saingy azoko izany.
But you have to see them.	Saingy tsy maintsy mahita azy ireo ianao.
I really like it.	Tena tiako izany.
Well, it has to be good first.	Eny ary, tsy maintsy ho tsara izany taloha.
But, it’s not too bad.	Saingy, tsy dia ratsy loatra izany.
We had nothing.	Tsy nanana na inona na inona izahay.
And father.	Ary ray.
He is not going anywhere now.	Tsy nandeha na aiza na aiza izy izao.
We decided to go see a movie last night.	Nanapa-kevitra ny handeha hijery sarimihetsika izahay omaly hariva.
The room is easy.	Mora ny efitrano.
It was very different.	Hafa be ilay izy.
But he could not get out.	Saingy tsy afaka nivoaka izy.
Yes, another year is in the book.	Eny, taona hafa no ao amin'ny boky.
The past and the future are out of the picture.	Miala amin'ny sary ny fotoana lasa sy ny ho avy.
He needed a lot of money right away.	Nila vola be avy hatrany izy.
He is a teacher.	Mpampianatra izy.
Apparently he is.	Toa izy no izy.
You need to know that.	Mila mahafantatra izany ianao.
I already knew it was done.	Efa fantatro fa vita izany.
We have been together for three years.	Efa telo taona izahay no niaraka.
But it seemed true, in a way.	Saingy toa marina izany, tamin'ny fomba iray.
She’s beautiful, this girl, but not very pleasant.	Tsara tarehy izy, ity tovovavy ity, saingy tsy dia mahafinaritra loatra.
These are the children.	Ireo no ankizy.
Money, for one thing.	Vola, ho an'ny zavatra iray.
And that's true.	Ary marina izany.
Sounds a lot of fun.	Toa mahafinaritra be.
Probably not very interested.	Mety tsy dia liana loatra.
There may be more rain tomorrow.	Mety hisy orana bebe kokoa rahampitso.
No one seems to be lost.	Toa tsy misy very hevitra.
He got it from you.	Nahazo izany taminao izy.
And he couldn’t think about it either tomorrow.	Ary tsy afaka nieritreritra momba izany koa izy rahampitso.
The person will just leave.	Ho lasa fotsiny ilay olona.
Children love him.	Tia azy ny ankizy.
He worked for him.	Niasa taminy izy.
And for another, it scared him.	Ary ho an'ny iray hafa, natahotra azy izany.
I hope you are okay with that.	Manantena aho fa tsy maninona ianao amin'izany.
Maybe you should stop now.	Angamba tokony hijanona ianao izao.
One, not many.	Iray, tsy betsaka.
Then came these questions.	Dia tonga ireo fanontaniana ireo.
It is not possible to sleep.	Tsy azo atao ny matory.
It’s easier to stay at home.	Mora kokoa ny mijanona ao an-trano.
It was easy to find.	Mora ny nahita azy.
Last car.	Fiara farany.
And they made history.	Ary nanao ny tantara izy ireo.
Yes, you get the same error.	Eny, mahazo fahadisoana mitovy ianao.
It was all new to him.	Vaovao ho azy izany rehetra izany.
Hope to get one of these soon.	Manantena ny hahazo iray amin'ireo tsy ho ela.
If so, it is likely to be wrong.	Raha izany no izy, dia azo inoana fa ho diso.
No one spoke at all.	Tsy nisy niteny mihitsy.
He was almost alone now.	Saika niresaka irery izy izao.
He had it.	Nanana izany izy.
He never treated her well but just stayed with her.	Tsy nitondra azy tsara mihitsy izy fa nijanona niaraka taminy ihany.
He didn't seem happy about that.	Toa tsy faly tamin’izany izy.
That was his biggest problem.	Izany no olana lehibe indrindra taminy.
How to.	Ahoana no.
He went in there.	Niditra tao izy.
It is still the same today.	Dia mbola toy izany ihany ankehitriny.
This method works well.	Ity fomba ity dia miasa tsara.
And that is still not enough.	Ary mbola tsy ampy izany.
He was only interested in money.	Ny vola ihany no liana izy.
I didn’t spend much time thinking about it.	Tsy nandany fotoana firy aho nieritreritra an'izany.
And it stays that way.	Ary mijanona izany.
He watched the children play.	Nijery ny ankizy nilalao izy.

He hadn’t traveled very far before.	Tsy nandeha lavitra be izy taloha.
He works hard and does a good job.	Miasa mafy izy ary manao asa tsara.
I’m really busy with things like that.	Tena sahirana aho amin'ny zavatra toy izany.
It was just a little annoying.	Tezitra kely fotsiny ilay izy.
This is not the case.	Tsy izany no izy.
I think we have enough.	Heveriko fa ampy izahay.
He was there.	Teo izy.
He often is.	Izy matetika.
I will do good.	Hanao ny tsara aho.
Very nice new friend.	Namana vaovao tena mahafinaritra.
But yes, I never had a chance.	Saingy eny, tsy nanana fahafahana mihitsy.
And he still is.	Dia mbola izy.
It does something for me.	Manao zavatra amiko izany.
Maybe I'm wrong.	Diso angamba aho.
There should be a word.	Tokony hisy teny iray.
It's almost two.	Efa ho roa izany.
I've been thinking about you for a long time.	Efa ela aho no nieritreritra anao.
You can follow a fun story.	Afaka manaraka tantara mahafinaritra ianao.
It doesn’t matter if you still come.	Tsy maninona raha mbola tonga ianao.
It's not too hard.	Tsy dia mafy loatra ilay izy.
But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Saingy tsy afaka nijanona nieritreritra izany.
I really like him.	Tena tiako izy.
This is also new.	Vaovao koa izany.
There are not many opportunities to work here.	Tsy dia betsaka ny fahafahana miasa eto.
You have never done that before.	Mbola tsy nanao izany mihitsy ianao.
There aren’t many these days.	Tsy dia misy firy amin'izao andro izao.
I wondered if he would survive.	Nanontany tena aho raha ho velona izy.
Then he started.	Dia nanomboka izy.
The problem does not stop with these issues.	Tsy mijanona amin'ireo olana ireo ihany ny olana.
If you did, it was fun.	Raha nanao izany ianao dia mahafinaritra.
You should come back.	Tokony hiverina ianao.
The last and greatest problem is ours.	Ny olana farany sy lehibe dia antsika.
This is very untrue.	Tena tsy marina izany.
She loves this man.	Tiany io lehilahy io.
Yes, he wanted more than that.	Eny, naniry mihoatra noho izany izy.
I'm still real.	Mbola tena aho.
You need to make sure you have everything.	Tokony ho azonao antoka fa manana ny zava-drehetra ianao.
They seem to love me.	Toa tia ahy izy ireo.
They are children.	Ankizy izy ireo.
We do not believe that.	Tsy mino izany izahay.
Quick.	Haingana.
All cars are moving fast now.	Mandeha haingana ny fiara rehetra ankehitriny.

Don’t go the wrong way.	Aza mandeha amin'ny lalana diso.
You can't do that.	Tsy mahazo manao izany ianao.
Hope to see you !.	Manantena ny hahita anao!.
Maybe that’s the best.	Angamba izany no tsara indrindra.
It doesn’t.	Tsy manao izany.
I didn’t try to be late.	Tsy niezaka ny ho tara aho.
I bought a car.	Nividy fiara aho.
The weather today is good.	Tsara ny andro androany.
I'm from one.	Avy amin'ny iray aho.
He seemed to know what to do.	Toa fantany izay tokony hataony.
He really did.	Tena nanao izany izy.
She is very good.	Tena tsara izy.
I know you will.	Fantatro fa hanao izany ianao.
You will understand why.	Ho azonao ny antony.
Or wait.	Na miandry.
I should be able to do that.	Tokony ho vitako izany.
That’s a lot.	Betsaka izany.
This is one of them.	Ity no iray amin'ireo.
Like you.	Tahaka anao.
I want them all to be different.	Tiako ho samy hafa izy rehetra.
It works well for me.	Miasa tsara amiko izy io.
But, it didn’t happen.	Saingy, tsy nisy izany.
I want it done first.	Tiako ho vita aloha ilay izy.
He needed to see her.	Nila azy hahita izy.
It’s gone too.	Lasa koa izany.
He got it right away.	Nahazo izany avy hatrany izy.

He went well.	Nandeha tsara izy.
I don't need kids anymore.	Tsy mila ankizy intsony aho.
It’s hard to know where exactly that is.	Sarotra ny mahafantatra hoe aiza marina izany.
No problem is too big or too small.	Tsy misy olana lehibe loatra na kely loatra.
That says something.	Izany dia milaza zavatra.
He now had a friend.	Nanana namana izy izao.
And, maybe he’s right.	Ary, marina angamba izy.
That could be a mistake.	Mety ho fahadisoana izany.
You will find two words.	Hahita teny roa ianao.
I think no one can.	Heveriko fa tsy misy afaka.
I was sick.	Narary aho.
Who cares, all the money and everything.	Iza no mihevitra izany, ny vola rehetra sy ny zavatra rehetra.
I could see that he was not angry either.	Hitako fa tsy tezitra koa izy.
However, it is done.	Na izany aza, vita izany.
And as before, he wrote a letter.	Ary toy ny teo aloha dia nanoratra taratasy.
You have a question and need help.	Manana fanontaniana ianao ary mila fanampiana.
And they did so.	Dia nanao izany izy ireo.
Everyone could see it now, and knew she was a woman.	Afaka nahita izany ny rehetra ankehitriny, ary mahafantatra fa vehivavy izy.
I just knew we would be together.	Fantatro fotsiny fa hiaraka isika.
There is no question about that.	Tsy misy fanontaniana momba izany.
And he is not alone.	Ary tsy irery izy.
Meet me at one.	Hihaona amiko any amin'ny iray.
No, that is not true.	Tsia, tsy marina izany.
He is not ready to go home yet.	Mbola tsy vonona ny hody izy.
It needs more work.	Mila asa bebe kokoa izany.
Then he spoke.	Dia vao niteny izy.
It's just not right.	Tsy mety mihitsy izany.
It was so beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy ilay izy.
In fact, it’s harder than that.	Raha ny marina dia sarotra kokoa noho izany.
Not all is lost.	Tsy very daholo.
There is no real luck there either.	Tsy misy tena vintana any koa.
And if you don’t know, you can’t believe.	Ary raha tsy mahafantatra ianao dia tsy afaka mino.
A letter, please?	Taratasy iray azafady?
One man died.	Lehilahy iray no maty.
So tell me about yourself.	Koa lazao amiko ny momba anao.

And it won’t be.	Ary tsy ho izany.
Or really, question.	Na tena, fanontaniana.
One man died.	Nisy lehilahy iray maty.
I'm happy to be here.	Faly aho eto.

Not the last either.	Tsy ny farany ihany koa.
Anyone who saw the dog was still there.	Na iza na iza nahita ilay alika dia mbola teo.
Apparently he was planning to go somewhere.	Toa nikasa ny handeha ho aiza izy.
I want you to talk to me.	Tiako hiresaka amiko ianao.
But tonight you don’t work.	Fa anio alina dia tsy miasa ianao.
They came in last.	Niditra farany izy ireo.
He took us there.	Izy no nitondra anay tany.
He saw it right away.	Nahita izany avy hatrany izy.
There are a few major issues with this.	Misy olana lehibe vitsivitsy momba izany.
He had time.	Nanana fotoana izy.
It’s really great.	Tena lehibe tokoa.
I'm really sorry.	Tena miala tsiny aho.
More on that tomorrow.	Bebe kokoa momba izany rahampitso.
He was a real child.	Tena zaza tokoa izy.
I did too.	nataoko koa.
Then thank you very much.	Dia misaotra betsaka.
And had.	Ary nanana.
No one lived there anymore.	Tsy nisy nipetraka tao intsony izao.
Old beautiful little road.	Lalana kely tsara tarehy taloha.
The paper is also full.	Feno izany koa ny taratasy.
He had just returned from abroad.	Vao niverina avy any ivelany izy.
Too many questions.	Be loatra ny fanontaniana.
It doesn’t work anymore.	Tsy mandeha intsony izany.

It was early in the morning and not very clear.	Vao maraina ny andro ary tsy dia mazava loatra.
He did well.	Nanao tsara izy.

I think it’s good luck for them.	Heveriko fa tsara vintana ho azy ireo izany.
Like more food.	Toy ny sakafo bebe kokoa.

This one he knew right away.	Ity iray ity dia fantany avy hatrany.

He was now playing at night when he was alone.	Nilalao alina izy izao raha irery.
He had to sit down.	Tsy maintsy nipetraka izy.
The two of us in the car didn't say much.	Tsy nisy niteny firy izahay roa tao anaty fiara.
I think everyone knows that.	Heveriko fa fantatry ny rehetra izany.
No one does it better.	Tsy misy manao izany tsara kokoa.
It was a full weekend.	Dia faran'ny herinandro feno izany.
But that is only for today.	Fa izany ihany no ho an'ny anio.
And he didn't have anything to do with it.	Ary tsy nanana ny zavatra hanaovana izany izy.
I'm not just from you.	Tsy avy aminao fotsiny aho.
There are so many of them.	Be dia be izy ireo.
Either way, it’s not about me.	Na izany na tsy izany, tsy momba ahy izany.
We played bad.	Nilalao ratsy izahay.
This coming week will be even better.	Mbola ho tsara kokoa aza ity herinandro ho avy ity.
He wanted something a little pictorial.	Naniry zavatra kely sary izy.

And that for me is like, the future.	Ary izany ho ahy dia toy ny, ny ho avy.

In fact, too many.	Raha ny marina, maro loatra.
So what exactly.	Ka inona marina.
You are a teacher.	Mpampianatra ianao.
They know you and know how and why.	Mahafantatra anao izy ireo ary mahafantatra ny fomba sy ny antony.
Not anymore.	Tsy izao intsony.

He learns first.	Izy aloha dia mianatra.
He was angry.	Tezitra izy.
I just have no idea.	Tsy manana hevitra fotsiny aho.

Apparently he did.	Toa nanao izany izy.
If he wants to see me, he knows the way.	Raha te hahita ahy izy, dia fantany ny lalana.
It’s very appropriate.	Tena mety izany.
One minute, maybe two, up.	Iray minitra, roa angamba, ambony.
This is the real story.	Izany no tena tantara.
Someone has to do something about it.	Tokony hisy hanao zavatra momba izany.
Words on that.	Teny amin'izany.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
Of course, he moved away.	Mazava ho azy fa niala lavitra izy.

We thought he might be sick.	Nihevitra izahay fa mety narary izy.

It has existed before.	Efa nisy izy io taloha.
He will be good, because he has to be good.	Ho tsara izy, satria tsy maintsy ho tsara.
I just watched this really good movie.	Vao avy nijery ity sarimihetsika tena tsara ity aho.

He then asked why he needed me.	Nanontany izy avy eo hoe nahoana izy no mila ahy.
This is a great day.	Andro lehibe izao.
And they could never hope to win the season.	Ary tsy afaka nanantena ny handresy ny fotoana mihitsy izy ireo.

He will not be like that either.	Tsy ho toy izany koa izy.
Nothing big at all.	Tsy misy lehibe mihitsy.

Then he looks at me.	Dia mijery ahy izy.
She was scared.	Natahotra izy.
I also went back to work.	Niverina niasa koa aho.

The patient did not eat.	Tsy nihinana ilay marary.
Don’t think so.	Aza mieritreritra izany.
Fools and the like are confused.	Very hevitra ny adala sy ny toa azy.

I wondered what led to this.	Nanontany tena aho hoe inona no nitondra an'io.
The face is very clear.	Mazava be ny tarehy.
How long did he study?	Hafiriana izy no nianatra?
But no one was there.	Saingy tsy nisy olona tao.
I am the only one here.	Izaho irery no eto.
They are still children.	Mbola zaza izy ireo.
Last week was tough.	Sarotra ny herinandro lasa.
I am the right person.	Izaho no olona mety.
It’s a bigger story at another time.	Tantara lehibe kokoa izany amin'ny fotoana hafa.
There were three.	Nisy telo.
He fell asleep.	Renoky ny torimaso izy.
Yes, it may not be all that.	Eny, mety tsy izany rehetra izany.
People who don’t work.	Olona tsy miasa.
There are a lot of kids there.	Misy ankizy be dia be ao.
Surely they would have seen him too.	Azo antoka fa ho nahita azy koa izy ireo.
However, mine did.	Na izany aza, ny ahy dia nanao izany.
Never worry.	Aza manahy mihitsy ianao.
You must have heard.	Tsy maintsy efa nandre ianao.
But it’s really not that hard.	Saingy tena tsy dia sarotra izany.
The man is not well known.	Tsy dia fantatra loatra ilay lehilahy.
And me.	Sy izaho.
It's not fun.	Tsy mahafinaritra izany.
This is a great thing.	Zavatra lehibe ity.
Is this the right path?	Izany ve no lalana mety?
Where will they go?	Ho aiza izy ireo?
Or better yet stay.	Na aleo mijanona.
I ask what made them do the work.	Manontany aho hoe inona no nahatonga azy ireo hanao ny asa.
It is a difficult task.	Asa sarotra izany.
Well, they never told us that.	Eny, mbola tsy nilaza izany taminay mihitsy izy ireo.
They will come back.	Mbola hiverina izy ireo.
It should not be like this.	Tsy tokony ho toy izao izany.
I asked what it was.	Nanontany aho hoe inona izany.
I have never seen anything like it.	Tsy mbola nahita zavatra toy izany aho.
He could make food with everything and nothing.	Afaka nanao sakafo tamin'ny zavatra rehetra sy ny tsy misy izy.
Even now, he considered himself to be the same.	Na dia izao aza dia nihevitra ny tenany ho iray ihany izy.
And it’s really crazy.	Ary tena adala mihitsy.
He will see it.	Hahita izany izy.
He got a lot of things.	Be dia be ny zavatra azony.
But not enough.	Saingy tsy ampy.
Our place today is different.	Hafa ny toerana misy antsika ankehitriny.
I thought we were going.	Nihevitra aho fa handeha izahay.
But it’s so much better.	Saingy tsara lavitra izany.
The same is true.	Toy izany koa.
Sick, but not too sick.	Marary, fa tsy marary loatra.
This is not necessarily true.	Tsy voatery ho marina izany.
They may be right.	Mety ho marina izy ireo.
We did not ask why.	Tsy nanontany ny antony izahay.
I wondered why he was asking me.	Nanontany tena aho hoe nahoana izy no nanontany ahy.
And so it was then.	Ary toy izany koa ny tamin'izany.
But you don’t.	Saingy tsy manao izany ianao.
I can't say if that's the case.	Tsy afaka milaza aho raha izany no izy.
I bought it.	Nividy azy aho.
While still learning.	Raha mbola mianatra.
They are fast, easy and fun too.	Haingana, mora ary mahafinaritra koa izy ireo.
I can't do that.	Tsy vitako izany.
He may not like it.	Mety tsy tiany izany.
We have other kinds of problems.	Manana karazana olana hafa isika.
So he is somewhere.	Ka any amin'ny toerana iray izy.
He felt lost.	Nahatsiaro very izy.
It will definitely help this guy.	Azo antoka fa hanampy io lehilahy io.
They are harder because they are bigger.	Sarotra kokoa izy ireo satria lehibe kokoa.
And he wanted her to be with him.	Ary tiany hiaraka aminy izy.
It looks like a house.	Toa trano izy io.
No one should do that.	Tsy misy tokony hanao toy izany.
It was really fun for him.	Tena nahafinaritra azy izany.
He started there.	Nanomboka teo izy.
We, really.	Isika, tena.
It loves him.	Tia azy izany.
It cost a lot of money.	Nandany vola be.
I’m not angry at anything.	Tsy tezitra na inona na inona aho.
Here I am again.	Amin'izany indray aho.
I saw where they were.	Hitako ny toerana misy azy ireo.
This was completely new to me.	Tena vaovao tanteraka tamiko izany.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Saingy toa tsy mandeha izany.
You don’t think well.	Tsy mieritreritra tsara ianao.
He saw nothing.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona izy.
That seems too much.	Toa be loatra izany.
It was hard work but fun.	Asa sarotra nefa nahafinaritra ilay izy.
Better not, better not.	Aleo tsy, aleo tsy.
So, no one has them.	Noho izany, tsy misy olona manana azy ireo.
It had to be somewhere.	Tsy maintsy teto tany ho any.
I tried to leave.	Niezaka niala aho.
I'm still fast asleep.	Mbola renoky ny torimaso aho.
I hope you will too.	Manantena aho fa hanao izany koa ianao.
They are hard but good for kids.	Mafy izy ireo fa tsara ho an'ny ankizy.
Not that he liked the job.	Tsy hoe tiany ilay asa.
There is also not enough food.	Tsy ampy koa ny sakafo.
And not everything looked good.	Ary tsy nijery tsara ny zava-drehetra.
Yes, it is not.	Eny, tsy izany.
He is a strong player.	Mpilalao mafy izy.
He wanted to get out of here.	Naniry hiala teto izy.
They just can’t get away with it.	Tsy afaka miala tsara fotsiny izy ireo.
He is not like other children.	Tsy toy ny ankizy hafa izy.
But two things.	Fa zavatra roa.
It works twice.	Miasa roa izy io.
They will do whatever it takes.	Hanao izay rehetra ilaina izy ireo.
He may or may not.	Mety izy, na tsia.
He tried many times and in many ways, but he failed.	Nanandrana matetika sy tamin’ny fomba maro izy, saingy tsy nety izy.
We talked about him and us.	Niresaka momba azy sy izahay.
Fun first.	Mahafinaritra aloha.
Yes, he really did.	Eny, tena nanao izany izy.
The first is male.	Ny voalohany dia lehilahy.
Everything has a variety.	Ny zavatra rehetra dia manana karazana.
I like the small, but it works.	Tiako ny kely, nefa miasa.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra ilay izy.
The work was done without a hitch.	Vita tsy nisy na inona na inona ny asa.
It's done.	Vita izany.
I asked him if it was.	Nanontany azy aho raha azy io.
I can't do it anymore.	Tsy afaka manao intsony aho.
There was no house, no house.	Tsy nisy trano, tsy nisy trano.
That's good.	Tsara izany.
Then we do something else.	Dia manao zavatra hafa izahay.
Just a few questions.	Fanontaniana vitsivitsy ihany.
They were really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra izy ireo.
I want him to see me.	Tiako hahita ahy izy.
Maybe both.	Angamba izy roa.
Of course, something was wrong with him.	Mazava ho azy fa nisy zavatra tsy nety taminy.
The music is better.	Tsara kokoa ny mozika.
It’s hard to read about him every day.	Sarotra ny mamaky momba azy isan'andro.
This is a bad job.	Asa ratsy izany.
He is very sick now.	Marary mafy izy ankehitriny.
I thought for a full minute.	Nieritreritra iray minitra feno aho.
I have to sleep.	Tsy maintsy matory aho.
That is now.	Izany dia izao.
No picture books.	Tsy misy boky sary.
You don’t know what he looks like.	Tsy fantatrao hoe manao ahoana izy.
Because we can see it.	Satria afaka mahita azy isika.
Then things went very fast.	Avy eo dia nandeha haingana be ny zava-nitranga.
She is the only woman he loves.	Izy irery no vehivavy tiany.
He, or she, is lost.	Izy, na izy, dia very.
Now they will be able to see clearly.	Ankehitriny dia ho afaka hahita mazava izy ireo.
It’s something else, too.	Zavatra hafa koa izany.
I think men are harder.	Heveriko fa sarotra kokoa ny lehilahy.
He knew he should be here.	Fantany fa tokony ho teto izy.
They are all with women.	Izy rehetra miaraka amin'ny vehivavy.
There weren’t many.	Tsy dia nisy firy.
We will come for you.	Ho avy ho anao izahay.
That’s what got me.	Izany no nahazo ahy.
Nothing is certain.	Tsy misy zavatra azo antoka.
Which is possible.	Izay mety.
You have two months.	Manana volana roa ianao.
But another first.	Fa iray hafa aloha.
What's that.	Inona izany.
And that’s great.	Ary lehibe izany.
Good for me.	Tsara amiko.
Not that he could have blamed her.	Tsy hoe afaka nanome tsiny azy izy.
It belongs to him.	Azy io.
At the last moment.	Amin'ny fotoana farany.
It’s just kind of.	Karazana fotsiny io.
Or love him.	Na tia azy.
This is how it works.	Toy izao no miasa.
It was a wonderful time.	Fotoana nahafinaritra izany.
You can't do that anymore.	Tsy afaka manao izany intsony ianao.
It’s a very difficult process.	Fomba sarotra be izany.
It all works well.	Izany rehetra izany dia miasa tsara.
I felt like a child.	Nahatsiaro ho toy ny zaza aho.
And if you’re out there, you’ll be one of those things.	Ary raha any ivelany ianao dia ho iray amin'ireo zavatra ireo.
He could not do what he should have done here.	Tsy afaka nanao izay tokony hataony teto izy.
We decided on these questions.	Nanapa-kevitra ireo fanontaniana ireo izahay.
Even me.	Na izaho aza.
Like hard work.	Toy ny asa mafy.
He was angry with himself when he did something wrong.	Tezitra amin’ny tenany izy rehefa nanao ratsy.
I'm thinking about it here.	Mieritreritra ny eto aho.
The work done.	Ny asa vita.
You're not going to give it to me.	Tsy handeha hanome ahy ianao.
I have a good job, so there it is.	Manana asa tsara aho, ka misy izany.
I know we didn’t.	Fantatro fa tsy nanao izany izahay.
I walk alone.	Mandeha irery aho.
They talked night and morning.	Niresaka alina sy maraina izy ireo.
Because we hope it’s okay.	Satria manantena izahay fa mety.
This is bigger than me.	Lehibe noho izaho ity.
So two things.	Ka zavatra roa.
He was used to getting what he wanted.	Efa zatra nahazo izay tiany izy.
Because those two had to be written and no one wrote.	Satria tsy maintsy nisy nanoratra ireo roa ireo ary tsy nisy nanoratra.
I don't think that's right.	Heveriko fa tsy mety izany.
Any other more appropriate method?	Fomba hafa mety kokoa?
I might die.	Mety ho maty aho.
I sleep outside.	Matory any ivelany aho.
Others can too.	Ny hafa koa dia afaka.
Everyone knows everything.	Fantatry ny rehetra ny zava-drehetra.
People are angry.	Tezitra ny olona.
People are happy about that too.	Faly koa ny olona amin’izany.
And then yes.	Ary dia eny.
And they are.	Ary izy ireo.
You are lucky if you get two out of three.	Tsara vintana ianao raha mahazo roa amin'ny telo.
We're going to watch a movie tonight.	Hijery sarimihetsika isika anio hariva.
The idea of	Ny hevitra momba ny
I will not stop.	Tsy hijanona aho.
No cars were moving.	Tsy nisy nandeha ireo fiara.
He never left.	Tsy niala mihitsy izy.
Tonight was no different.	Tsy nisy hafa mihitsy ny androany alina.
Even better.	Tsara kokoa koa.
I remember.	tadidiko .
If so, come back.	Raha nisy izany dia hiverina.
You never think so but that’s what it is.	Tsy mieritreritra an'izany mihitsy ianao fa izany no izy.
That's mine.	Izay ny ahy.
In fact, it's not right.	Raha ny marina dia tsy mety izany.
Maybe you don’t like it.	Angamba tsy tianao izany.
I have never called someone like that.	Tsy mbola niantso olona toy izany mihitsy aho.
No one should help him.	Tsy misy tokony hanampy azy.
I can't say that.	Tsy afaka milaza izany aho.
It's the new year.	Taona vaovao izao.
He really said that.	Tena nilaza izany izy.
I don’t know exactly where they are.	Tsy fantatro ny tena toerana misy azy ireo.
In fact, no, it still does.	Raha ny marina, tsia, mbola manao izany.
I believe this is true, good or bad.	Mino aho fa marina izany, na tsara na ratsy.
There is no time for that, now.	Tsy misy fotoana ho an'izany, izao.
But that’s what happened recently.	Saingy izay no nitranga vao haingana.
You are never sick.	Tsy marary mihitsy ianao.
Even if you don’t know.	Na dia tsy fantatrao aza.
That must be true.	Tsy maintsy ho marina ihany izany.
No one asked me.	Tsy nisy nangataka ahy.
Maybe you can help.	Angamba afaka manampy ianao.
The latter died there.	Maty tao ity farany.
He could buy whatever he wanted.	Afaka nividy izay tiany izy.
He is right.	Marina ny azy.
He may be right.	Mety ho marina izy.
Both did not work.	Samy tsy niasa.
I have no problem with this.	Tsy manana olana aho amin'ity.
Works perfectly with this type of book.	Miasa tanteraka amin'ity karazana boky ity.
He had to admit that he was different from himself.	Tsy maintsy niaiky izy fa tsy mitovy amin'ny tenany izy.
No amount of money is too small.	Tsy misy vola kely loatra.
No one helped him.	Tsy nisy nanampy azy.
He knew that door.	Fantany io varavarana io.
I was always scared.	Natahotra foana aho.
But he couldn’t bring himself to do more than that.	Saingy tsy afaka nitondra ny tenany hanao mihoatra noho izany izy.
But now the body is like a dead body.	Fa ankehitriny ny tena dia toy ny maty.
He studied because he was scared.	Nianatra satria natahotra izy.
He doesn’t care.	Tsy miraharaha izy.
I had to stop thinking about it.	Tsy maintsy nijanona tsy nieritreritra an’izany intsony aho.
It is too strong.	Mafy loatra.
You know it, you know it.	Fantatrao izany, fantany izany.
I think he did something wrong.	Heveriko fa nanao zavatra ratsy izy.
Of course he will.	Mazava ho azy fa hanao izany izy.
I always am.	Izaho foana .
But this year is a little different.	Saingy hafa kely ity taona ity.
It is not here or there.	Tsy eto na any izany.
It must be hard.	Tsy maintsy ho sarotra izany.
He just can’t.	Tsy afaka fotsiny izy.
He loved her.	Tiany izy.
You think it’s going to be a great thing.	Mihevitra ianao fa ho zavatra lehibe.
Everything was lost and no one gained.	Very daholo ary tsy nisy nahazo.
This is not pretty but it works well.	Tsy tsara tarehy ity fa miasa tsara.
And for breakfast.	Ary amin'ny sakafo maraina.
I'm happy to be with you.	Faly aho miaraka aminao.
But when it worked, it was fun.	Fa rehefa niasa dia nahafinaritra.
However, this woman can be herself.	Na izany aza, io vehivavy io dia afaka ny ho ny tenany ihany.
The money came in quickly.	Niditra haingana ny vola.
He told me he loved me.	Nilaza tamiko izy fa tia ahy.
These were not like that.	Tsy nisy toy izany ireo.
He wanted news, and he wanted it fast.	Naniry vaovao izy, ary naniry izany haingana.
He admitted that there was a lot of truth.	Niaiky izy fa betsaka ny marina.
This is good news.	Vaovao tsara izany.
I can't wait, man.	Tsy afaka miandry aho, lehilahy.
I know it seems so, but it’s not true.	Fantatro fa toa izany, saingy tsy marina izany.
If you are, you know, wonder.	Raha toa ianao ka, fantatrao, manontany tena.
Everyone knows these stories.	Fantatry ny rehetra ireo tantara ireo.
There were times when nothing happened.	Nisy fotoana indray tsy nisy nitranga.
And we’ll get you next year.	Ary hahazo anao izahay amin'ny taona manaraka.
Yes, what happened here was bad.	Eny, ratsy ny zava-nitranga teto.
And so do we.	Ary manao izany koa isika.
And this weekend was really crazy.	Ary tena adala tokoa io faran'ny herinandro io.
More than anything.	Mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra.
He went to take a closer look.	Nandeha nijery akaiky kokoa izy.
And no one will tell me.	Ary tsy hisy hilaza amiko.
However, it is a good thing to do.	Na izany aza, zavatra tsara atao izany.
But it’s often a good thing.	Saingy matetika ny zavatra tsara.
Well that’s all history now.	Eny ary izany rehetra izany dia tantara ankehitriny.
Don’t look at this story.	Aza mijery an'io tantara io.
And he heard it again.	Dia nandre izany indray izy.
I am happy for these things.	Faly aho noho ireo zavatra ireo.
I don't understand.	Tsy azoko.
I didn’t sit in the car and read a book.	Tsy nipetraka tao anaty fiara aho ary namaky boky.
I tried this.	Nanandrana ity aho.
And from above, everything looks good.	Ary avy any ambony dia toa tsara ny zava-drehetra.
It shouldn’t be long.	Tsy tokony ho lava.
Trying to be everywhere but there, with him.	Miezaka ny ho any amin'ny toerana rehetra fa eo, miaraka aminy.
However, no one returned.	Na izany aza, tsy nisy niverina.
He is an older child.	Zaza lehibe izy.
It is as follows.	Toy izao manaraka izao izany.
And they are right.	Ary marina ireo.
Not these things at all.	Tsy ireo zavatra ireo mihitsy.
There may be a little rain.	Mety hisy orana kely.
Of course, that is what happened.	Mazava ho azy fa izany no nitranga.
It won't come out.	Tsy hivoaka izany.
Not his room either.	Tsy ny efitranony ihany koa.
He said he didn't understand me.	Nilaza izy fa tsy azony aho.
There were only thirty people there.	Olona telopolo ihany no teo.
She told me she loved him more than anything.	Nilaza tamiko izy fa tia azy mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra.
He stopped one day.	Nijanona indray andro izy.
I love this wonderful story.	Tiako ity tantara mahafinaritra ity.
There were times when we didn’t sleep.	Nisy fotoana vao tsy natory izahay.
No one was in the room.	Tsy nisy olona tao amin’ilay efitrano.
If that doesn't work.	Raha tsy mety izany .
I became close to them.	Lasa akaiky azy ireo aho.
That's right, water.	Marina izany, rano.
I didn’t want to be one.	Tsy naniry ny ho iray aho.
There is nothing more I can do.	Tsy misy azoko atao intsony.
But today is the day.	Fa androany no andro.
I think you have a problem.	Heveriko fa manana olana ianao.
It’s not dead yet.	Mbola tsy maty izany.
Smaller and faster dogs.	Alika kely kokoa sy haingana kokoa.
I'm reading it now.	Mamaky azy aho izao.
Never has, never will be.	Tsy mbola nisy, tsy hisy mihitsy.
But why do you do that?	Fa nahoana ianao no manao toy izany?
You did not eat.	Tsy nihinana ianao.
It’s not hard either.	Tsy sarotra koa izany.
And he was that year.	Ary tamin'izany taona izany izy.
Then he came.	Dia tonga izy.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra.
Not all, right.	Tsy ny rehetra, marina.
We're going to get to that.	Handeha ho amin'izany isika.
More food and snacks.	Sakafo sy sakafo bebe kokoa.
I don’t know why it should be like that.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana no tokony ho toy izany.
But he can't be right.	Saingy tsy afaka ny ho marina izy.
He is nothing more.	Tsy inona intsony izy.
It was almost impossible to do so.	Saika tsy ho vita mihitsy ny nanao izany.
That is where we are today.	Izany no misy antsika ankehitriny.
I still don’t believe it.	Mbola tsy mino izany.
There wasn’t much there.	Tsy nisy zavatra betsaka tany.
And there isn’t.	Ary tsy misy izany.
However, the following is done.	Na izany aza, ny manaraka dia atao.
This is totally sick.	Marary tanteraka ity.
He doesn't love you.	Tsy tia anao izy.
Over the weekend, there weren’t many.	Nandritra ny faran'ny herinandro dia tsy dia nisy firy.
I am very sick of men like you.	Marary mafy ny lehilahy toa anao aho.
The car was still there.	Mbola teo ihany ilay fiara.
I just don’t want this to be any different.	Tsy tiako ho hafa fotsiny ity.
He knew her well.	Fantany tsara izy.
The only person he knew.	Ilay hany olona fantany.
They work all day on it.	Miasa mandritra ny andro izy ireo amin'izany.
The problem seems complicated.	Toa sarotra ny olana.
The car is small so there are no problems there.	Kely ny fiara ka tsy misy olana any.
Tell us more about it.	Lazao anay bebe kokoa momba izany.
Even when he was, he didn’t know.	Na dia fony aza izy, dia tsy fantany.
You are a man.	Lehilahy ianao.
And this house.	Ary ity trano ity.
I couldn’t have imagined that.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra an'izany aho.
It’s a perfect fit.	Tena mety tsara izany.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Antony roa angamba no nahatonga izany.
I can't think of what.	Tsy afaka mieritreritra aho hoe inona.
You can find the right place for you.	Azonao atao ny mahita ny toerana mety aminao.
This could be for a number of reasons.	Mety ho noho ny antony maro izany.
I went to him.	Nankany aminy aho.
I want to go out more.	Te hivoaka bebe kokoa aho.
He seemed to understand exactly what was happening.	Toa azony tsara ny zava-nitranga.
So let's not talk to anyone.	Ka aleo tsy miteny na iza na iza.
Are you really fit?	Tena mety ve ianao?
The food is ready.	Efa vonona ny sakafo.
We are here and have work to do.	Eto izahay ary manana asa hatao.
In fact, they are just as bad as ever.	Raha ny marina dia ratsy toy ny taloha ihany izy ireo.
Reading a book.	Mamaky boky.
Some say that we are not what we used to be.	Misy milaza fa tsy toy ny taloha intsony isika.
It couldn’t help but wonder.	Tsy afaka ny tsy nanontany tena izany.
This is a problem.	Olana izany.
He seems to like it.	Toa tiany izany.
The work is difficult.	Sarotra ny asa.
Tell him the same thing.	Lazao azy ny zavatra mitovy.
We have to get used to it now.	Tokony ho zatra izany isika izao.
That's a problem.	Olana io.
I’m still working on that.	Mbola miasa amin'izany aho.
Because the day has become night.	Satria lasa alina ny andro.
He had no money.	Tsy nanana vola izy.
But as soon as he walked out the door he saw nothing.	Saingy raha vao nivoaka ny varavarana dia tsy nahita na inona na inona.
The teacher asked him.	Nanontany azy ny mpampianatra.
He was very scared.	Tena natahotra izy.
He is the best.	Izy no tsara indrindra.
She felt better this morning.	Nahatsiaro ho tsara kokoa izy androany maraina.
I'd love to see you outside.	Tiako ny mahita anao any ivelany.
He was in the water for a long time.	Tao anaty rano nandritra ny fotoana ela izy.
We can't stop.	Tsy afaka mijanona izahay.
But you are a beautiful girl.	Fa ianao dia tovovavy tsara tarehy.
I don't want to see him again.	Tsy te hahita azy intsony aho.
That is not what happened here.	Tsy toy izany no nitranga teto.
It's hard to sleep.	Sarotra ny matory.
I'm the only one working here.	Izaho ihany no miasa eto.
Well, you’re sure we’ll do that, well.	Eny, azonao antoka fa hanao izany izahay, tsara.
I apologize to you.	Miala tsiny aminao aho.
But now he saw it.	Nefa izy izao no nahita izany.
But that much doesn’t seem possible.	Saingy toa tsy azo atao izany maro izany.
You could be wrong.	Mety ho diso ianao.
When he returned, he fell asleep.	Rehefa niverina izy, dia natory izy.
Of course you will get mistakes.	Mazava ho azy fa hahazo fahadisoana ianao.
I'm sure you know that.	Azoko antoka fa fantatrao izany.
He needed a place.	Nila toerana izy.
I didn’t know you were here, at home.	Tsy fantatro fa teto ianao, tao an-trano.
These letters scared me at first.	Natahotra ahy ireo taratasy ireo tamin’ny voalohany.
This is for many reasons.	Izany dia noho ny antony maro.
He wanted to make sure it would never happen again.	Te hahazo antoka izy fa tsy hisy intsony izany.
The same is true of.	Toy izany koa ny .
It’s crazy to think.	Adala ny mieritreritra.
He won't talk about it.	Tsy hiresaka momba izany izy.
She loved seeing him so happy, so happy.	Tiany ny nahita azy faly be, faly be.
He is a teacher.	Mpampianatra izy.
Either way, they had a problem.	Na izany na tsy izany, dia nisy olana izy ireo.
He is a man, or close to him.	Lehilahy izy, na akaiky azy.
I have to think about it.	Tsy maintsy mieritreritra an'io aho.
Then the time came.	Dia tonga ny fotoana.
Then he started to leave.	Dia nanomboka niala izy.
It doesn’t seem to be possible.	Toa tsy ho vita izany.
It is very difficult.	Tena sarotra be izany.
He was ready to go.	Efa vonona ny handeha izy.
However, it can’t be a problem.	Na izany aza, tsy afaka olana.
I kind of.	I karazana.
I saw it up close.	Hitako akaiky izany.
Yes, watch it all tonight.	Eny, hijery ny rehetra anio alina.
Is there any other way to do this.	Misy fomba hafa hanaovana izany ve.
But tell me what you think !.	Fa lazao ahy ny hevitrao!.
He has to be something.	Tokony ho zavatra izy.
They will soon do so.	Tsy ho ela dia hanao izany izy ireo.
A lot of cars were still working.	Betsaka ny fiara mbola niasa.
Really big house.	Trano lehibe tokoa.
They are not alone.	Tsy izy ireo ihany.
It was for him.	Ho azy izany.
No one saw him come.	Tsy nisy nahita azy tonga.
Yes, someone did.	Eny, nisy iray nanao izany.
No one is eating now.	Tsy misy mihinana izao.

I want to do something, be a person.	Te hanao zavatra aho, ho olona.
I'm not very lucky.	Tsy dia manana vintana aho.
But not now.	Fa tsy izao.
I've seen them before.	Nahita azy ireo aho taloha.
We did nothing wrong.	Tsy nanao ratsy izahay.
Anyone help us get the idea.	Na iza na iza hanampy anay hahazo ny hevitra.
He spoke quickly and easily.	Haingana sy haingana izy niteny.
He looks very angry.	Toa tezitra be izy.
There is nothing clear or wrong here.	Tsy misy mazava tsara na diso eto.
I don't need to say anything else.	Tsy mila miteny zavatra hafa akory aho.
Often there is not much there.	Matetika dia tsy misy firy any.
How is that.	Ahoana izany.
He had also seen them last night.	Efa nahita azy ireo koa izy omaly alina.
They left because they were crazy.	Lasa izy ireo satria adala.
He thought well.	Nieritreritra tsara izy.
I work on it.	Miasa amin'izany aho.
It is a good book.	Boky tsara ilay izy.
It is not clear about that.	Tsy mazava ny amin'izany.
If you are interested you can read more about me here.	Raha liana ianao dia afaka mamaky bebe kokoa momba ahy eto.
That’s what I thought this morning.	Izay no heveriko androany maraina.
This is completely wrong.	Diso tanteraka izany.
Because of many things.	Noho ny zavatra maro.
But there is something bigger about that.	Saingy misy zavatra lehibe kokoa amin'izany.
He had to sit down before he died.	Nila nipetraka izy vao maty.
He should be angry.	Tokony ho tezitra izy.
But that is the first.	Fa izay no voalohany.
Now he knows it won’t happen.	Ankehitriny dia fantany fa tsy hitranga izany.
There may have been.	Mety nisy.
I'm not used to that.	Tsy zatra ny toy izany aho.
Here it just goes.	Eto fotsiny dia lasa.
And that has been in the last two days.	Ary izany dia tao anatin'ny roa andro farany.
They are crazy.	Adala izy ireo.
I can't speak now.	Tsy afaka miteny aho izao.
Cute kids are dying.	Maty ny ankizy mahafinaritra.
I really like it.	Tena tiako ilay izy.
However, at first.	Na izany aza, tamin'ny voalohany.
Of course, this is not possible.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy azo atao izany.
He seemed surprised.	Toa gaga izy.
I like loud music.	Tiako ny mozika mafy.
People are busy.	Sahirana ny olona.
I called a few friends.	Niantso namana vitsivitsy aho.
Everything is perfect.	Tena tsara daholo ny zava-drehetra.
He seems confused.	Toa very hevitra izy.
There is nothing for you here.	Tsy misy na inona na inona ho anao eto.
We need to know who we really are.	Mila mahafantatra isika hoe iza marina isika.
He wonders how old he is.	Manontany tena izy hoe firy taona izy.
The problem is you.	Ny olana dia ianao.
I'm not too happy.	Tsy faly loatra aho.
I think you were wrong about everything.	Heveriko fa diso ianao tamin'ny zava-drehetra.
We are talking about the same thing.	Miresaka zavatra iray ihany izahay.
He knew what was happening and he did nothing.	Fantany ny zava-nitranga ary tsy nanao na inona na inona izy.
I know there was.	Fantatro fa nisy.
I know he won’t come back.	Fantatro fa tsy hiverina izy.
I would like a room.	Mila efitrano aho.
Children are often angry.	Tezitra matetika ny ankizy.
Maybe it’s too late for me for this but it might help others.	Angamba tara loatra amiko amin'ity fa mety hanampy ny hafa.
He is watching.	Mijery izy.
Do not be afraid.	Aza matahotra.
He says something.	Milaza zavatra izy.
It is not difficult.	Tsy sarotra izany.
No one really knows.	Tsy misy mahalala tokoa.

The water came.	Tonga ny rano.
I love you as much as you do.	Tiako ianao tahaka ny anao.
Something like this.	Zavatra toy izao.
You really like them.	Tena tianao izy ireo.
I paused for a moment.	Nijanona kely aho.
You have to know.	Tsy maintsy ho fantatrao.
But he has mine.	Saingy manana ny ahy izy.
One said it was too little.	Ny iray nilaza fa kely loatra.
That never happened.	Tsy izany mihitsy no nitranga.
It is very easy to do.	Tena mora ny manao izany.
The question is difficult.	Sarotra ny fanontaniana.
It's getting late.	Somary hariva ny andro.
You did it.	Ianao no nanao izany.
Of course, that was not the case.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izany no nitranga.
We can do it perfectly !.	Afaka manao izany tanteraka isika!.
And it doesn’t matter.	Ary tsy maninona izany.
He hadn't seen one yet.	Mbola tsy nahita na dia iray akory aza izy.
People have ruled the earth for a long time.	Efa ela ny olona no nitondra ny tany.
We wondered about that.	Nanontany tena momba izany izahay.
Whether he likes it or not.	Na tiany izany na tsia.
It has now started to rain.	Efa nanomboka ny orana izao.
Where is he from	Avy taiza izy?
To me they are the best.	Amiko izy ireo no tsara indrindra.
No one left too early.	Tsy nisy niala aloha loatra.
I already had mine.	Efa nanana ny ahy aho.
And he brought even better news.	Ary mbola nitondra vaovao tsara kokoa izy.
I’ll have to remember that next time.	Tsy maintsy tadidiko izany amin'ny manaraka.
This is for two reasons.	Izany dia noho ny antony roa.
Yes, he died.	Eny, maty izy.
We’re just playing.	Milalao fotsiny izahay.
That is true.	Marina izany.
I'm not too afraid of you.	Tsy dia matahotra anao loatra aho.
There is no such thing.	Tsy misy zavatra mitovy amin'izany.
So what.	Ka inona.
They are things in the next room.	Zavatra ao amin'ny efitrano manaraka izy ireo.
What is closest.	Inona no akaiky indrindra.
I'm so glad to be here.	Tena faly aho tonga eto.
I really enjoyed studying.	Tena tia nianatra aho.
I want to do something fun.	Te hanao zavatra mahafinaritra aho.
Everyone seems to be talking about that moment.	Toa miresaka momba io fotoana io ny rehetra.
I knew it wasn’t going to happen.	Fantatro fa tsy hitranga izany.
Someone didn’t treat him well.	Nisy tsy nitondra azy tsara.
And we are here to help.	Ary eto izahay hanampy.
He knows what kind of woman I am.	Fantany hoe karazana vehivavy manao ahoana aho.
At the moment.	Amin'izao fotoana izao.
It certainly will.	Eny tokoa no hanao izany.
They won’t take you far.	Tsy hitondra anao lavitra izy ireo.
That is not a good word.	Tsy teny tsara izany.
I had to do it on my own.	Tsy maintsy nanao izany tamin'ny ahy aho.
It has to be done.	Tokony hatao.
I have never seen him.	Mbola tsy nahita azy mihitsy.
And in years.	Ary amin'ny taona.
Are you alright	Tsy maninona ve ianao?
Now it will be you.	Ankehitriny dia ho ianao.
No, not for us.	Tsia, tsy ho antsika.
And that's enough.	Ary ampy izay.
No more than one.	Tsy mihoatra ny iray.
I love these guys.	Tiako ireo lehilahy ireo.
I am in it almost every day.	Saika isan'andro aho no ao aminy.
Not that he needed it.	Tsy hoe nila izany izy.
However, it is old.	Na izany aza, efa taloha izany.
What? 	Inona?
He only returned yesterday.	Omaly ihany izy no niverina.
when the car is lost.	rehefa very ny fiara.
I haven't come to ask you yet.	Mbola tsy tonga nanontany anao aho.
They had never heard of such a house either.	Tsy mbola nandre momba ny trano toy izany koa izy ireo.
I can say that.	Afaka milaza izany aho.
But he has.	Saingy manana izy.
However, they still love me.	Na dia izany aza dia mbola tia ahy izy ireo.
Which is really wrong.	Izay tena diso.
But no.	Fa tsy .
Not a safe place.	Tsy toerana azo antoka.
He needed time for himself.	Nila fotoana ho an'ny tenany izy.
Nice to see you again.	Mahafinaritra ny mahita anao indray.
It could still happen one day.	Mbola mety hitranga izany indray andro any.
Today is gone.	Androany dia lasa.
He also said that.	Izy ihany koa no nilaza izany.
It's better he doesn't have it.	Aleo izy tsy manana.
It even came to us.	Tonga teo aminay mihitsy.
I believe there was.	Mino aho fa nisy izany.
The man asked for it.	Nangataka izany ilay lehilahy.
The car was stolen.	Nisy nangalatra ilay fiara.
You can stay there as long as you want.	Afaka mijanona ao ianao raha mbola tianao.
But this is not very new.	Saingy tsy dia vaovao loatra izany.
But that is not the end.	Saingy tsy izany no farany.
He has to go himself.	Tsy maintsy mandeha ny tenany.
Anyway, they both saw it.	Na ahoana na ahoana dia samy nahita izany izy roa.
I think mine is the same.	Heveriko fa mitovy ny ahy.
You told me that.	Ianao no nilaza tamiko izany.
Work hard, play hard.	Miasa mafy, milalao mafy.
We watched the same movie.	Nijery sarimihetsika mitovy izahay.
I don't need to drink.	Tsy mila misotro aho.
We have to do better than that.	Tsy maintsy manao tsara kokoa noho izany isika.
This is a difficult thing.	Zavatra sarotra izany.
I'm really not happy.	Tena tsy faly aho.
But they are still not easy.	Saingy mbola tsy mora izy ireo.
That's a problem.	Olana io.
You need to stay on top.	Mila mijanona ho ambony indrindra ianao.
He never understood the path.	Tsy azony mihitsy ny lalana.
We will be back as soon as possible.	Hiverina haingana araka izay azo atao izahay.
Now he gets it.	Izao dia azony.
He hoped it would stop.	Nanantena izy fa nijanona izany.
Too many years.	Taona maro loatra.
In fact, don’t say more than yes.	Raha ny marina, aza miteny mihoatra noho ny eny.
I like it more.	Tiako kokoa.
Maybe they’re just trying to come up with an idea and do it.	Miezaka milaza hevitra fotsiny angamba izy ireo ary manao izany.
Not anymore.	Tsy izany intsony.
Even in the end you didn’t say anything.	Na dia tamin'ny farany aza dia tsy niteny na inona na inona ianao.
Better not think about anything.	Aleo tsy mieritreritra na inona na inona.
It’s time, or the past tense.	Fotoana izany, na ny fotoana lasa.
And he tried everything.	Ary nanandrana ny zava-drehetra izy.
Also, as I said.	Ary koa, araka ny nolazaiko.
Some people are willing to give a little more.	Misy olona vonona hanome kely kokoa.
He seemed to want it for me, but it was better.	Toa te ho ahy izy, saingy tsara kokoa.
Sounds good to me.	Toa tsara amiko.
He makes no mistakes.	Tsy manao fahadisoana izy.
He spoke loudly and so did the men with him.	Niteny mafy izy ary toy izany koa ireo lehilahy niaraka taminy.
A few days maybe.	Andro vitsivitsy angamba.
Yes, it works.	Eny, miasa izany.
There is no such chance here.	Tsy misy vintana toy izany eto.
It’s like he doesn’t like these.	Toy ny hoe tsy tiany ireo.
Released on no.	Nivoaka tamin'ny no.
It usually works.	Matetika izy io no miasa.
Return to lava.	Hiverina any amin'ny lava.
I am leaving in the morning.	Handeha aho ny maraina.
They are not wrong.	Tsy diso izy ireo.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Manantena aho fa hanao izany indray azo antoka.
And so do we.	Ary toy izany koa isika.
What are you looking for? 	Mitady inona?
Or not enough.	Na tsy ampy.
We read books every day.	Mamaky boky isan’andro izahay.
He didn't need to look at them.	Tsy nila nijery azy ireo izy.
If so, we don’t need to do anything.	Raha izany no izy dia tsy mila manao na inona na inona isika.
They were in a difficult place.	Tao anatin'ny toerana sarotra izy ireo.
They may have been scared at first.	Natahotra angamba izy ireo tamin’ny voalohany.
I really don’t care.	Tena tsy miraharaha aho.

I have a lot of time for him.	Manana fotoana be ho azy aho.
In this regard, .	Noho izany, .
Don’t ask why I need to look for this but I just do.	Aza manontany hoe nahoana aho no mila mitady an'io fa ataoko fotsiny.
So, we’re done.	Noho izany, vita isika.

He is trying hard.	Miezaka tsara izy.
If you suspect you have.	Raha miahiahy ianao fa manana.
You will never see me again.	Tsy hahita ahy intsony ianao.
I’m not saying you are, of course.	Tsy milaza aho fa ianao, mazava ho azy.
Not until last night.	Tsy hatramin’ny omaly hariva.
I want them to go home.	Tiako hody izy ireo.
We need to do something.	Mila manao zavatra isika.
You better come too.	Aleo tonga koa ianao.
Just a good length.	Lava tsara fotsiny.
It is not clear.	Tsy mazava izany.
They will get nothing from him.	Tsy hahazo na inona na inona avy aminy izy ireo.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Tsy mbola nisy toy izany ny zavatra toy izany.
We are the best.	Isika no tsara indrindra.
Well, it's done.	Eny ary, vita izany.
We need to do that.	Mila manao izany isika.
But no, it’s not.	Saingy tsia, tsy izy io.
He is right.	Marina ny azy.
It doesn’t seem real.	Toa tsy tena izy io.
The minutes seem to have passed.	Toa lasa ny minitra.
But that's the right thing to do.	Fa izay no mety.
So is he.	Toy izany koa izy.
You need new clothes.	Mila akanjo vaovao ianao.
Something is wrong.	Misy zavatra tsy mety.
Maybe not good.	Angamba tsy tsara.
But as time went on, it settled.	Saingy rehefa nandeha ny fotoana dia nipetraka izany.
She watched him for a month.	Nijery azy nandritra ny iray volana izy.
Good comes from all evil.	Ny tsara dia avy amin'ny ratsy rehetra.
So why did you do that?	Koa nahoana ianao no nanao izany?
I saw it right away.	Hitako avy hatrany izany.
But, it could be even better.	Saingy, mbola mety ho tsara kokoa izany.
No one can doubt that.	Tsy misy afaka misalasala izany.
We spent the night.	Nandany ny alina izahay.
It could be.	Mety ho.
He didn't say anything.	Tsy niteny na inona na inona izy.
It’s kind of crazy, that’s what it is.	Karazana adala izany, izany no izy.
That may be true.	Marina angamba izany.
To take us into the future.	Mba hitondra antsika ho amin'ny ho avy.
Not just for work but for everything.	Tsy ho an’ny asa ihany fa ho an’ny zava-drehetra.
And no, it's not.	Ary tsia, tsy izany akory.
And by himself.	Ary amin'ny tenany.
I want you to be able to work.	Tiako fa afaka miasa ianao.
He wasn't sure why.	Tsy azony antoka ny antony.

Not with this.	Tsy miaraka amin'ity.
At times like this, it helps you a lot.	Amin'ny fotoana toy izany dia manampy anao betsaka izany.
He wants to see you.	Te hahita anao izy.
It could have happened to me.	Mety ho nitranga tamiko izany.
I drink water.	misotro rano aho.
And now he knows what they are.	Ary ankehitriny dia fantany hoe inona izy ireo.
I was very busy walking.	Tena sahirana aho nandeha.
Better and better.	Tsara sy tsara kokoa.
I don't understand anymore.	Tsy azoko intsony.
In history.	Ao amin'ny tantara.
Finally! 	Farany!
He was angry, and had to do something about it.	Tezitra izy, ary tsy maintsy nanao zavatra momba izany.
I think we’ve seen that in the future.	Heveriko fa efa nahita izany ho avy isika.
He still didn't speak.	Mbola tsy niteny ihany izy.
Good with big.	Tsara miaraka amin'ny lehibe.
Which could be a mistake.	Izay mety ho fahadisoana.
You just work for me.	Miasa ho ahy fotsiny ianao.

It's raining too.	Avy koa ny orana.
If it happened once, it could happen again.	Raha nitranga indray mandeha izany dia mety hitranga indray izany.
What is the weather like?	Manao ahoana ny andro ao?
I wanted money in every way.	Naniry vola aho tamin'ny fomba rehetra.
I had to tell him.	Tsy maintsy nilaza taminy aho.
They tried.	Niezaka izy ireo.
Or leave again.	Na miala indray.

I don’t care anymore.	Tsy miraharaha intsony aho.
They kept saying that.	Nilaza izany hatrany izy ireo.
I really knew where they were.	Fantatro tokoa hoe taiza izy ireo.
An idea might be as follows.	Ny hevitra iray dia mety ho toy izao manaraka izao.
But you can do something about it.	Saingy afaka manao zavatra momba izany ianao.
Despite this, it remained the same.	Na dia teo aza izany, dia nijanona ihany.
Now, he did.	Ankehitriny, nanao izany izy.
Absolutely wrong.	Tena diso tanteraka.
He cannot die.	Tsy afaka maty izy.
He looked at her.	Nijery azy izy.
Even better is nothing.	Na tsara kokoa aza ny tsy misy.
There was a lot of it.	Be dia be tao.
That’s a lot.	Tena betsaka izany.
You could be something more.	Mety ho zavatra bebe kokoa ianao.
However, not much.	Na izany aza, tsy dia betsaka.
And nothing good comes out of it.	Ary tsy misy zavatra tsara azo avy amin'izany.
He was surprised.	Gaga izy.
The same goes for everything else.	Toy izany koa ny zavatra hafa rehetra.
We are free.	Afaka izahay.
Very well done !.	Tena vita tsara!.
The dog is walking.	Mandeha ny alika.
Don’t think you need it.	Aza mieritreritra fa mila izany ianao.

Many have homes.	Maro no manana trano.

But not the question.	Fa tsy ny fanontaniana.
i love mine	tiako ny ahy.
And now we are no longer looking for them.	Ary ankehitriny tsy mitady azy ireo intsony isika.
The next word is no.	Ny teny manaraka dia tsy.
We started talking.	Nanomboka niresaka izahay.
He wants to get out of the house again.	Te hivoaka ny trano indray izy.
Like, any day.	Toy ny, na inona na inona andro.
He knew he had no luck.	Fantany fa tsy manana vintana izy.
And the kids can be done.	Ary mety ho vita ny ankizy.
It will be a great day, it will be a good tomorrow.	Ho andro lehibe izany, ho tsara rahampitso.
And they are superior to the players.	Ary ambony noho ny mpilalao izy ireo.
He told me you could be like that.	Nilaza tamiko izy fa mety ho toy izany ianao.
And it works for me.	Ary miasa amiko izany.
He should have looked at them before.	Tokony ho nijery azy ireo izy taloha.
And to see them.	Ary mba hahita azy ireo.
Everything had a reason.	Ny zava-drehetra dia nisy antony.

He just came out.	Nivoaka fotsiny izy.

Here we are now.	Eto isika izao.

He called again.	Niantso indray izy.
Still going.	Mbola mandeha.
He was sick, yes.	Narary izy, eny.
The question now is whether they will actually do it.	Ny fanontaniana ankehitriny dia raha tena hanao izany izy ireo.
And the reason is unclear at first.	Ary ny antony tsy mazava amin'ny voalohany.
I don’t know what it is.	Tsy fantatro hoe inona izany.

But then, that might be a good thing.	Saingy avy eo, mety ho zavatra tsara izany.
But it is unlikely to happen any time soon.	Saingy tsy azo inoana fa hitranga tsy ho ela izany.
I knew it would be easy.	Fantatro fa ho mora izany.
I will see you.	Hahita anao aho.
Both carry the same image.	Samy mitondra sary mitovy.
Not that he knew about them.	Tsy hoe fantany ny momba azy ireo.
I still can't say anything.	Tsy mbola afaka miteny na inona na inona.
I know that very well.	Fantatro tsara izany.
It’s more complicated.	Sarotra kokoa izany.
He knew it, and he loved her for it.	Fantany izany, ary tiany izy noho izany.
These are two different problems.	Olana roa samy hafa ireo.
Not only that.	Tsy izay ihany.
Nice stuff here.	Zavatra mahafinaritra eto.
I really believe he liked it.	Tena mino aho fa tiany ilay izy.
A day for it.	Andro iray ho azy io.
Got it or had to call, whatever.	Nahazo azy na voatery niantso, na inona na inona.
Yes, it suits me.	Eny, mety amiko izany.
You know you shouldn’t be here.	Fantatrao fa tsy tokony ho eto ianao.
I don’t think it would have been more difficult.	Heveriko fa tsy ho sarotra kokoa izany.
I think that was the worst time.	Heveriko fa izany no fotoana ratsy indrindra.
He loves it here.	Tiany eto.
This is a really bad job.	Tena asa ratsy izany.
Someone called him.	Nisy niantso azy.
Nor can the poor be forgiven.	Tsy azo avela koa ny sahirana.
Now, if you will.	Ankehitriny, raha hanao izany ianao.
It has to be tonight.	Tsy maintsy ho anio alina izany.
There are no words for him.	Tsy misy teny ho azy.
I could no longer hear.	Tsy nandre intsony aho.
He can't do that.	Tsy azony atao izany.
And here’s another idea.	Ary ity misy hevitra hafa.
This book has all three.	Ity boky ity dia manana ny telo.
I wasn't too angry then.	Tsy dia tezitra loatra aho tamin’izany.
It was all over, as if he was going to get out somewhere.	Vita ny rehetra, toy ny hoe hivoaka any ho any izy.
It may have been in him.	Mety ho tany aminy izany.
But apparently not, now.	Saingy toa tsy izany, ankehitriny.
Next time expect to stay for a month.	Amin'ny manaraka manantena ny hijanona mandritra ny iray volana.
He hopes to find a better job.	Manantena ny hahita asa tsara kokoa izy.
I didn’t think much of it.	Tsy dia nieritreritra loatra aho.
It’s tough.	Mafy izany.
You worked hard.	Niasa mafy ianao.
He was fun.	Nahafinaritra izy.
We saw a few people there.	Nahita olona kely izahay teo.
No one cares.	Tsy misy miraharaha izany.
Crazy because they played so well.	Adala satria nilalao tsara izy ireo.
Yes, it's okay.	Eny, tsy maninona.
You alone can't.	Ianao irery no tsy afaka.
He is very, very real.	Tena marina izy, tena marina.
Easier to buy this movie.	Mora kokoa ny mividy ity sarimihetsika ity.
True, but not entirely true.	Marina, nefa tsy tena marina.
It has to be good.	Tsy maintsy tsara izany.
There is only one reason for this.	Iray ihany no nahatonga izany.
It must have been fun to see him more.	Azo antoka fa nahafinaritra ny nahita azy bebe kokoa.
But both have.	Fa samy manana.
I wanted more.	Naniry bebe kokoa aho.
I'll see him.	Hahita azy aho.
They need it.	Mila azy izy ireo.
Nice to see you again.	Mahafinaritra ny mahita anao indray.
But something is wrong with me.	Saingy misy zavatra tsy mety amiko.
She was scared.	Natahotra izy.
I'm still waiting, actually.	Mbola miandry aho, raha ny marina.
Nice, good pictures, good story.	Mahafinaritra, sary tsara, tantara tsara.
Most likely you will.	Tena azo inoana fa hanao izany ianao.
Afraid to do the right thing.	Matahotra ny hanao ny tsara.
Lost that one.	Very io iray io.
And it's not.	Ary tsy izany.
Then they ask.	Dia manontany izy ireo.
So why did you do that? 	Koa nahoana ianao no nanao izany?
It may be the same for you.	Mety ho toy izany koa ho anao.
It will always be for you.	Ho anao foana izany.
He didn't seem very interested.	Toa tsy dia liana loatra izy.
I see it today.	Hitako izany amin'izao andro izao.
He did a really good job.	Tena nanao asa tsara izy.
The children were sick and could not study.	Narary ireo ankizy ary tsy afaka nianatra.
You will be too late to drive anywhere today.	Ho tara loatra ianao raha hitondra fiara na aiza na aiza anio.
I love the song.	Tiako ilay hira.
I had that too.	Nanana izany koa aho.
The girls are with them and with the kids.	Ny tovovavy dia miaraka amin'ireo ary miaraka amin'ny ankizy.
But soon.	Saingy tsy ho ela.
He did not ask for anything for himself.	Tsy nangataka na inona na inona ho an'ny tenany izy.
Not alone.	Tsy irery.
I work on one.	Miasa amin'ny iray aho.
If anything happened, this is what would happen.	Raha nisy zavatra nitranga dia izao no hitranga.
If he did, you would know.	Raha nanao izany izy dia ho fantatrao.
You can buy them.	Afaka mividy azy ireo ianao.
I ate and got very sick.	Nihinana aho ka narary mafy.

The child was very sick.	Narary mafy ilay zaza.
The room was empty, but he did not feel alone.	Foana ilay efitrano, nefa tsy nahatsiaro ho irery izy.
He doesn't understand.	Tsy azony.
But you wonder.	Fa manontany tena ianao.
I hope he is still alive.	Manantena aho fa mbola velona izy.
Finally he couldn't wait any longer.	Farany dia tsy afaka niandry intsony izy.
You know that, fool.	Fantatrao izany, adala.
Maybe he was a man.	Angamba lehilahy izy.
It may come quickly.	Mety ho tonga haingana izany.
So tell me now.	Koa lazao ahy izao.
And the word is very close to you.	Ary ny teny dia tena akaiky anao.
You just know what has to happen.	Fantatrao fotsiny izay tokony hitranga.

It could still happen.	Mbola mety hitranga izany.
I'm happy about that.	Faly aho noho izany.
The best is yet to come !.	Mbola ho avy ny tsara indrindra!.
And then he started drinking.	Ary dia nanomboka nisotro izy.
Home is home.	Trano no trano.
There is always something good even for an ugly woman.	Misy zavatra tsara foana na dia vehivavy ratsy tarehy aza.
This is a big mistake.	Fahadisoana lehibe izany.
I am not for them.	Tsy ho azy ireo aho.
Not so, even today.	Tsy izany, na dia amin’izao andro izao aza.
They didn’t talk about it.	Tsy niresaka momba izany izy ireo.
We don’t have that.	Izahay tsy manana izany.
It’s really fun for us.	Tena mahafinaritra ho antsika.
No one dies at all.	Tsy misy maty mihitsy.
I don’t know when or how and why.	Tsy haiko hoe rahoviana na ahoana ary nahoana.
They decided to stay where they were.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hijanona amin’ny toerana nisy azy izy ireo.
I’m not sure who said that first.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe iza no niteny an'io voalohany.
This is done privately with other men.	Izany dia atao manokana miaraka amin'ny lehilahy hafa.
Maybe someone knows more.	Angamba misy mahafantatra bebe kokoa.
Time to do good.	Fotoana hanaovana ny tsara.
I did, but not right.	Nanao aho, saingy tsy marina.
You know you are beautiful.	Fantatrao fa tsara tarehy ianao.
When he first did so, he made a bad mistake.	Tamin'ny voalohany nanao izany izy dia nanao fahadisoana ratsy.
It is already doing the same.	Efa manao toy izany koa.
I started to think he didn’t think so.	Nanomboka nieritreritra aho fa tsy nieritreritra izany izy.
He never understood it.	Tsy azony mihitsy izany.
He decided he had to leave.	Nanapa-kevitra izy fa tsy maintsy hiala.
I had never seen it before.	Tsy mbola nahita aho taloha.
Not afraid of him.	Tsy matahotra azy.
It can be a lot or a little.	Mety ho be na kely izany.
You can be sure he will get the job.	Mety ho azonao antoka fa hahazo ilay asa izy.
Nothing should be.	Tsy misy tokony ho izy.
And nothing happened for a long time.	Ary tsy nisy zava-nitranga nandritra ny fotoana ela.
The actor decided not to make the trip.	Nanapa-kevitra ny tsy hanao ilay dia ilay mpilalao sarimihetsika.
He has already said that.	Efa nilaza izany izy.

And they both know they can’t stay here.	Ary samy mahalala fa tsy afaka mijanona eto.
It was at home for many years.	Tao an-trano nandritra ny taona maro izy io.
He is there.	Eo izy.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Tsy te hiresaka momba izany izy.
A plausible story.	Tantara azo inoana.
He must have known.	Tsy maintsy ho fantany.

Tell me what you can do.	Lazao ahy izay azonao atao.
You can see me now.	Afaka mahita ahy ianao izao.
Hope to see you in time.	Manantena ny hahita anao amin'ny fotoana.

They both don’t have the same story here.	Samy tsy manana tantara mitovy aminy eto.
Where we will be.	Aiza no hisy antsika.
It’s a story.	Tantara izany.
I stay busy, man.	Mijanona ho sahirana aho, lehilahy.
I personally am very interested in this news.	Izaho manokana dia tena liana amin'ity vaovao ity.
He was confused.	Very hevitra izy.
I may not come for years.	Mety tsy ho tonga aho mandritra ny taona maro.
Everything is dead.	Maty daholo ny zava-drehetra.
Maybe it would have been better if he hadn’t said anything.	Angamba tsara raha tsy niteny na inona na inona izy.
And that’s why the movie didn’t go.	Ary izay no nahatonga ilay sarimihetsika tsy nandeha.
The woman told him that someone would come in.	Nilaza taminy ilay vehivavy fa hisy olona hiditra ao.
Neither do we.	Tsy isika koa.
Many other ideas are better.	Hevitra maro hafa no tsara kokoa.

It is too late.	Efa tara izao.

He entered the room.	Niditra tao amin’ilay efitrano izy.
It just isn’t enough.	Tsy ampy fotsiny izany.
I thought he should be there, even in this small way.	Nihevitra aho fa tokony ho eo izy, na dia amin’ity fomba kely ity aza.
I don't know what to do now.	Tsy hitako izay hatao izao.
I don't know what it is.	Tsy fantatro hoe inona ilay izy.

A few days ago, maybe two just saw him.	Andro vitsivitsy lasa izay, roa angamba vao nahita azy.

I still remember that first morning.	Mbola tadidiko io maraina voalohany io.
There can be no more.	Tsy mety hisy intsony.
Then he left.	Dia lasa izy.
There may be better times.	Mety hisy fotoana tsara kokoa.
We can even say you don’t drive anymore.	Afaka milaza mihitsy aza izahay fa tsy mitondra fiara intsony ianao.
But we have to go as fast as possible.	Saingy tokony handeha haingana araka izay azo atao isika.
The weather is always good.	Tsara foana ny andro.
It doesn't work.	Tsy mandeha izany.
No one could help me with that.	Tsy nisy olona afaka nanampy ahy tamin'izany.
We will discuss two major ones.	Hiresaka roa lehibe isika.
I saw a lot of things.	Be dia be ny zavatra hitako.
Although it may not be.	Na dia mety tsy izany aza.
I'm really sorry for that.	Tena miala tsiny amin'izany aho.
You are very important.	Tena ilaina ianao.
There is no such thing.	Tsy misy toy izany.
Maybe soon.	Mety tsy ho ela.
And he says so.	Ary milaza izany toy izany izy.
You never have to work on it otherwise.	Tsy mila miasa amin'izany mihitsy ianao raha tsy izany.
He saw her but did not see her.	Nahita azy izy fa tsy nahita azy.
They had already thought about it.	Efa nieritreritra izany izy ireo.
No one came to see what happened.	Tsy nisy tonga nijery ny zava-nitranga.
Because, for one, we don’t have such a thing.	Satria, iray, tsy manana zavatra toy izao isika.
He can help here.	Afaka manampy eto izy.
He told her the truth.	Nilaza ny marina taminy izy.
You may not do that.	Mety tsy manao izany ianao.
But they work well.	Saingy miasa tsara izy ireo.
I could clearly see where the book was.	Hitako mazava tsara hoe aiza ilay boky.
This all seems like good news.	Toa vaovao tsara izany rehetra izany.
He is something else.	Zavatra hafa izy.
It brings us.	Mitondra antsika izany.
It’s a very good fit.	Tena tsara ny mety.
It's all crazy.	Adala daholo.
Don’t let them win.	Aza avela handresy izy ireo.
It's just wrong.	Diso fotsiny izany.
I had to leave immediately.	Tsy maintsy niala teto avy hatrany aho.
I'm most sorry.	Miala tsiny indrindra aho.
I know where everyone is.	Fantatro ny toerana misy ny olona rehetra.
This is the last one.	Io no farany.
It shouldn’t be too hard.	Tsy tokony ho mafy loatra izany.
And he had an idea or two of his own.	Ary nanana hevitra iray na roa ho azy manokana izy.
It is no longer the case.	Tsy izany intsony no izy.
He knew the dangers.	Fantany ny loza mety hitranga.
We made our way last week.	Nanao ny lalana izahay tamin'ny herinandro lasa.
I will do more.	Mbola hanao bebe kokoa aho.
I’m leaving for something else.	Miala amin'ny zavatra hafa aho.
But he’s not that fast.	Saingy tsy dia haingana loatra izy.
He just sat there.	Nipetraka teo fotsiny izy.
He did such a good job.	Nanao asa tsara toy izany izy.
I'm just not ready.	Tsy vonona fotsiny aho.
So you have a little something.	Noho izany dia manana zavatra kely ianao.
Lots of clothes, but nothing she likes.	Be dia be ny akanjo, fa tsy misy zavatra tiany.
Of course, this will happen.	Mazava ho azy fa ho tanteraka izany.
The two waited while the others entered the house.	Niandry izy roa raha niditra ny trano ny hafa.
It was better but it still took more time.	Tsara kokoa izany nefa mbola nila fotoana bebe kokoa.
There are still a lot of appropriate questions.	Mbola be dia be ny fanontaniana nety.
He wasn't sure what to do.	Tsy azony antoka izay hataony.
They started again.	Nanomboka indray izy ireo.
The same is true of others.	Toy izany koa ny hafa.
This job made me nervous.	Io asa io dia nahatonga ahy ho sahirana.
I know you’ve become close to him.	Fantatro fa lasa akaiky azy ianao.
There is work to be done.	Misy asa tokony hatao.
Yes, yes, yes.	Eny, eny, eny.
But it was too late.	Saingy efa tara ny andro.
I think that’s a good fit.	Heveriko fa mety tsara izany.
And at first everything went well.	Ary tamin'ny voalohany dia nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
There may be a few reasons.	Mety misy antony vitsivitsy.
We are definitely tougher.	Azo antoka fa mafy kokoa izahay.
It is no longer necessary to do so.	Tsy ilaina intsony ny manao izany.
I had an idea.	Nanana hevitra aho.
I don’t know what will happen.	Tsy fantatro izay hitranga.
I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that.	Tsy miteny aho hoe misy tsy mety amin'izany.
I was there you know.	Teo aho fantatrao.
That will never happen, of course.	Tsy hitranga mihitsy izany mazava ho azy.
This will be done now.	Izany dia hatao amin'izao fotoana izao.
I don't apologize for that.	Tsy miala tsiny aho amin'izany.
For now, that is enough.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia ampy izay.
None of that.	Tsy misy amin'izany.
No one does that.	Tsy misy manao izany.
So do we.	Toy izany koa isika.
It spoke to him.	Niresaka taminy izany.
This movie seems to be familiar to everyone.	Toa fantatry ny rehetra ity sarimihetsika ity.
But for me, it was just right.	Fa ho ahy dia nety tokoa izany.
He walked fast.	Nandeha haingana izy.
I didn't hear that.	Tsy nandre izany aho.
No, we'll go out a little.	Tsia, hivoaka kely isika.
Lots of students here!	Be dia be ny mpianatra eto!
A lot has happened.	Be dia be ny zava-nitranga.
I really wanted that.	Naniry mafy an'izany aho.
You met him.	Nihaona taminy ianareo.
I have to be a beautiful actress.	Tokony ho mpilalao sarimihetsika tsara tarehy aho.
And that is after reading the story.	Ary izany dia rehefa avy namaky ny tantara.
I've really tried it.	Efa nanandrana tokoa aho.
Don’t wait for them.	Aza miandry azy ireo.
One is never enough.	Tsy ampy mihitsy ny iray.
I'm happy to stay.	Faly aho mijanona.
They are right where you are.	Tena eo amin'ny misy anao izy ireo.
It is not easy.	Tsy mora izany.
Absolutely.	Tanteraka.
He will not make the same mistake.	Tsy hanao fahadisoana toy izany koa izy.
He is tall.	Lava izy.
It has to be.	Tsy maintsy ho izy.
I have never heard an angry word from him.	Tsy mbola nandre teny tezitra taminy mihitsy aho.
But they are not that big.	Saingy tsy dia lehibe izy ireo.
It was a long way off.	Lavitra be ilay izy.
I already have.	Izaho efa.
Very surprised there.	Gaga be any.
We never wanted to leave.	Tsy te hiala mihitsy izahay.
No one spoke.	Samy tsy nisy niteny.
She didn't even know about him.	Tsy fantany akory ny momba azy.
That is true.	Marina izany.
He wasn't sure who he was.	Tsy azony antoka hoe iza izy.
We had to go fast.	Tsy maintsy nandeha haingana izahay.
You need to be good.	Mila mahay tsara ianao.
Is there room for error in there, absolutely.	Misy toerana ho an'ny fahadisoana ve ao, tanteraka.
Nothing happened.	Tsy nisy zava-nitranga.
Not to mention, too many women lead.	Tsy niteny hoe, be loatra ny vehivavy mitondra.
So is the day.	Toy izany koa ny andro.
You are still here for a reason.	Mbola eto ianao noho ny antony.
Looks like now is the right time.	Toa izao no fotoana mety.
However, there are still two.	Na izany aza, mbola misy roa.
I did something wrong.	Nisy tsy nety nataoko.
You will most likely win.	Azo inoana fa handresy ianao.
He has not been gone for years.	Efa taona maro izy no tsy lasa.
It’s late and why worry.	Tara ary maninona no manahy.
I'm not very well known.	Tsy dia fantatra loatra aho.
If he got help, it wasn’t from him.	Raha nahazo fanampiana izy, dia tsy avy aminy izany.
you ask.	manontany ianao.
I have many friends who are men.	Manana namana maro izay lehilahy aho.
It doesn't work.	Tsy mandeha izany.
Whoever they are, it doesn’t matter.	Na iza na iza izy ireo dia tsy maninona izany.
You’re very good at talking about anything.	Tena tsara ianao raha miresaka na inona na inona.
I don't remember very well.	Tsy tadidiko tsara.
These kinds of things.	Ireo karazana zavatra ireo.
In fact, he wasn’t sure if it was three days.	Raha ny marina, tsy azony antoka raha telo andro izany.
But the truth is that everything is going wrong.	Saingy ny marina dia ny zava-drehetra dia mandeha ratsy.
They are just beautiful.	Tsara tarehy fotsiny izy ireo.
Really? 	Tena?
Very safe.	Tena azo antoka.
Both were not here.	Samy tsy nisy teto.
In many ways.	Ho an'ny fomba maro.
I know he is right.	Fantatro fa marina izy.
He could not leave.	Tsy afaka niala izy.
I know people do that.	Fantatro fa manao izany ny olona.
They have been doing this for a long time.	Efa ela izy ireo no nanao izany.
He was surprised.	Gaga izy.
It can be fun.	Mety ho mahafinaritra izany.
Kind of goes every day, really.	Karazana mandeha isan'andro, tena.
People need to apologize when they do wrong.	Mila miala tsiny ny olona rehefa manao ny tsy mety.
You are not happy either.	Ianao koa tsy faly.
He sat there all day.	Nipetraka teo izy nandritra ny andro.
He knew immediately that he was at home.	Tonga dia fantany fa tao an-trano izy.
You have a problem now!	Manana olana ianao izao!
I won’t talk any more than that.	Tsy hiresaka mihoatra noho izany.
Yes, it is as bad as it is.	Eny, efa ratsy toy ny misy azy io.
But only himself.	Fa ny tenany ihany.
I tried, you know.	Nanandrana aho, fantatrao.
It won’t be the end, but we don’t know yet.	Tsy ho farany izy io, nefa mbola tsy fantany.
No problem whatsoever.	Tsy misy olana na inona na inona.
No, no.	Tsia, tsia.
I just don’t understand how.	Tsy azoko fotsiny hoe ahoana.
I hope this is not the case.	Manantena aho fa tsy izany no izy.
But it is not complete.	Saingy tsy feno.
The room is large.	Lehibe ny efitrano.
They decided to do it.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hanao izany izy ireo.
I will learn to be good.	Hianatra ho tsara aho.
Or it may not be for you.	Na mety tsy ho anao.
He was confused.	Very hevitra izy.
He did not say that.	Tsy nilaza izany izy.
I am that person.	Izaho io olona io.
And he told him.	Dia nilaza taminy izy.
He’s a talented player.	Mpilalao mpilalao mahay izy.
He is late again today.	Tara indray izy androany.
No one said that.	Tsy nisy nilaza izany.
Lucky you.	Tsara vintana ianao.
The girl desperately wanted to leave.	Naniry mafy ny hiala ilay tovovavy.
He saw the opportunity.	Nahita ny fahafahana izy.
No, he won't.	Tsia, tsy hanao izany izy.
Not me.	Tsy amiko.
I saw him talking.	Hitako niresaka.
Doing the right thing can help.	Ny fanaovana zavatra tsara dia mety hanampy.
That seems true to me.	Toa marina izany amiko.
I think it was just me.	Heveriko fa izaho ihany ilay izy.
They were talking about something completely different.	Niresaka zavatra hafa tanteraka izy ireo.
Very easy.	Tena mora.
I had many other things to do.	Nanana zavatra maro hafa tokony hatao aho.
He became like us and more.	Lasa toa antsika izy ary maro kokoa.
I want it to be fun.	Tiako ho mahafinaritra ilay izy.
When he was here, we didn’t remember him.	Fony izy teto dia tsy nahatsiaro azy izahay.
They are not and never will be.	Tsy izy ireo ary tsy hisy mihitsy.
This is bad and it will be difficult for us.	Ratsy izany ary ho sarotra ho antsika izany.
I went in right away.	Niditra avy hatrany aho.
And that was three days ago.	Ary izany dia telo andro lasa izay.
They seem to really love him.	Toa tena tia azy izy ireo.
Everyone was already here.	Efa teto daholo ny rehetra.
He is now.	Izao izy .
This should not be done.	Tsy tokony hatao izany.
This is good for them.	Tsara ho azy ireo izany.
People here know me.	Fantatry ny olona eto aminay aho.
Something is going to happen right now.	Misy zavatra hitranga amin'izao fotoana izao.
The former is the best.	Ny teo aloha no tsara indrindra.
There was a good time here once.	Nisy fotoana tsara teto indray mandeha.
I really understand him.	Tena azoko tsara izy.
No words yet.	Tsy mbola nisy teny.
He’s not the type.	Tsy izy no karazana.
For once, of course, true.	Indray mandeha, mazava ho azy fa marina.
He did it.	Izy no nanao izany.
I could never get in there.	Tsy afaka niditra tao mihitsy.
I hope for something good.	manantena zavatra tsara aho.
He has already done so.	Efa nanao izany izy.
I had both.	Nanana azy roa aho.
I often wondered how that would work.	Nieritreritra matetika aho hoe hanao ahoana izany.
Of course, this is not true.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy marina izany.
It didn't work for him.	Tsy nety taminy izany.
He was afraid not to do so.	Natahotra ny tsy hanao izany izy.
It really did exist.	Tena nisy tokoa izany.
Maybe he would be better off without her.	Angamba ho tsara kokoa izy raha tsy misy azy.
Whether you like it or not.	Na ho tianao izy na tsy tianao.
She is very happy.	Tena faly izy.
Completely dead, probably non -existent.	Maty tanteraka, mety tsy misy.
It’s fun, especially with kids.	Mahafinaritra izany, indrindra fa miaraka amin'ny ankizy.
Although I know better.	Na dia mahafantatra tsara kokoa aza.
I am smaller than this.	Kely noho ity aho.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy.
I can't do that.	Tsy vitako izany.
But he didn’t have it.	Saingy tsy nanana izany izy.
There it is.	Ao izany.
I didn’t ask for it.	Tsy nangataka izany aho.
If he leaves it, he leaves it.	Raha miala amin'izany izy dia miala amin'izany.
They did the hard work.	Nanao ny asa mafy izy ireo.
I see we have to watch you.	Hitako fa tsy maintsy mijery anao izahay.
There wasn’t much of it.	Tsy dia nisy loatra izany.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it.	Toa tsy te hiresaka momba izany izy.
We got in the car.	Niditra tao anaty fiara izahay.
No more than two minutes.	Tsy mihoatra ny roa minitra.
There was none.	Tsy nisy izany.
It’s a fun job, but a bad job.	Asa mahafinaritra izany, fa asa ratsy.
It's not very good.	Tsy dia tsara loatra izany.
You've been here before, haven't you?	Efa teto ianao taloha, sa tsy izany?
Only one thing is missing.	Zavatra iray ihany no tsy ampy.
But it could be good.	Fa mety tsara.
I know you're looking for him.	Fantatro fa mitady azy ianao.
I felt good.	Nahatsiaro tena ho tsara aho.
And he couldn't do anything for her.	Ary tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona ho azy izy.
Most high -ranking people live there.	Olona ambony no mipetraka indrindra ao.
Yes, not very good.	Eny, tsy dia tsara loatra.
He has a job he loves.	Manana asa tiany izy.
Then he left early in the morning.	Dia lasa vao maraina izy.
But this is how it was.	Fa toy izao no nisy azy.
It seems very real.	Toa tena misy tokoa.
Something is wrong without them.	Misy zavatra tsy mety raha tsy misy azy ireo.
That’s a lot this week.	Izany no betsaka amin'ity herinandro ity.
You couldn’t have done this stupid thing without you.	Tsy afaka nanao an'io adala io raha tsy teo ianao.
He looked at her and saw her.	Nijery azy izy ary nahita azy.
But now it must be wrong.	Fa izao dia tokony ho diso izany.
Didn't say where.	Tsy nilaza hoe aiza.
Everything was really hard, and it happened.	Ny zava-drehetra dia tena mafy, ary zava-nitranga.
Don't worry about me.	Aza manahy momba ahy ianao.
This can be done in many ways.	Azo atao amin'ny fomba maro izany.
In fact, he can probably play anything.	Raha ny marina, azo inoana fa afaka milalao na inona na inona izy.
But this room is not suitable.	Saingy tsy mety ity efitrano ity.
Just started.	Vao nanomboka.
No one had seen him since last summer.	Tsy nisy nahita azy hatramin'ny fahavaratra teo aloha.
It's at home.	Ao an-trano izany.
I remember the first one very well.	Tadidiko tsara ilay voalohany.
He may not even be a friend.	Mety tsy namana akory izy.
You never came back to me.	Tsy niverina tamiko mihitsy ianao.
It will be done.	Ho vita izany.
We might have, once.	Mety ho nanana isika, indray mandeha.
In spite of everything, he wanted to be there.	Na dia teo aza ny zava-drehetra, dia naniry ny ho eo izy.
I saw him walk.	Hitako nandeha izy.
Living in a house or apartment.	Mipetraka ao an-trano na trano.
Surely you know that.	Azo antoka fa fantatrao izany.
For better or for worse.	Na ho tsara na ho ratsy.
He went out to talk to her.	Nivoaka hiresaka taminy izy.
That could be bad.	Mety ho ratsy izany.
I will be a week or more away.	Ho lasa herinandro na mahery aho.
Now it is not.	Ankehitriny dia tsy izany.
She loves being in her room.	Tiany ny ao amin'ny efitranony.
He must have known.	Tsy maintsy fantany.
He had done something like that before.	Efa nanao zavatra toy izany izy taloha.
Should we do it or not.	Tokony hanao izany ve isika sa tsia.
It’s just something.	Zavatra fotsiny izany.
This is a small problem.	Olana kely izany.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra, nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
I doubt they would want to do that if they could.	Misalasala aho fa te hanao izany izy ireo raha azony atao.
It’s just us.	Isika ihany io.
Like, same reason.	Toy ny, antony mitovy.
I made up my mind.	Nanao hevitra aho.
Then he died.	Dia maty izy.
He had a good time.	Nanao fotoana tsara izy.
We are very happy about that.	Tena faly izahay noho izany.
You also need to work.	Mila miasa koa ianao.
He said he had to leave.	Nilaza izy fa tsy maintsy miala.
He seems confused.	Toa very hevitra izy.
It is easy to understand.	Mora azo izany.
We will find a suitable one.	Hahita iray mety isika.
I don’t want to do that.	Tsy te hanao izany aho.
Tell them why.	Lazao azy ireo ny antony.
I'm going there tonight.	Handeha eny aho anio hariva.
Lots of work.	Betsaka ny asa.
She's beautiful tonight.	Tsara tarehy izy androany alina.
And eat things.	Ary mihinana zavatra.
Maybe we could have stayed there.	Angamba afaka nijanona tao izahay.
Not the first time.	Tsy vao voalohany.
The day was a really bad weekend for him.	Tena faran'ny herinandro ratsy ho azy ny andro.
Now it does.	Ankehitriny dia manao izany.
He shouldn't have said anything.	Tsy tokony ho niteny na inona na inona izy.
So, they are far better.	Noho izany, aleo lavitra izy ireo.
We never say that.	Tsy miteny izany mihitsy izahay.
He is only thirty years old.	Vao telopolo taona izy.
It’s nice to see you up and up.	Mahafinaritra ny mahita anao ambony sy ambony.
Or maybe not his.	Na mety tsy azy.
He looks at himself long and hard.	Mijery ny tenany lava sy mafy.
I wondered what the problem was.	Nanontany tena aho hoe inona no olana.
There is nothing you can do about it right now.	Tsy misy na inona na inona azonao atao momba izany ankehitriny.
There has to be more to it.	Tsy maintsy misy bebe kokoa amin’izany.
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
Yes, you can find people who can do that.	Eny, afaka mahita olona afaka manao izany ianao.
I had no idea.	Tsy nanana hevitra aho.
He knows he doesn't like you.	Fantany fa tsy ianao no tiany.
And it’s only new if you haven’t read it.	Ary vaovao ihany izany raha tsy efa namaky azy.
Don't get too angry.	Aza tezitra loatra.
I can even do that.	Afaka manao izany mihitsy aza aho.
He still doesn't understand who he is now.	Mbola tsy azony hoe iza izy ankehitriny.
There weren’t many people today.	Tsy dia nisy olona firy androany.
I believe he is waiting for me.	Mino aho fa miandry ahy izy.
There is so much to do.	Be dia be ny tokony hatao.
There is nothing he can do.	Tsy misy azony atao.
Which of course I had.	Izay mazava ho azy fa nanana.
Early morning is best.	Ny maraina vao maraina no tsara indrindra.
But that wasn’t the worst thing that could have happened.	Saingy tsy izany no zavatra ratsy indrindra mety nitranga.
They both have it.	Samy manana ihany izy ireo.
I saw him come back alone.	Hitako niverina irery izy.
I'm really not scared.	Tena tsy matahotra aho.
Even at night he did not sleep.	Na ny alina aza dia tsy natory izy.
I looked closer.	Nijery akaiky kokoa aho.
We did it together.	Niaraka nanao izany izahay.
He decided not to return.	Nanapa-kevitra ny tsy hiverina izy.
That might be good for him.	Mety ho tsara ho azy izany.
He doesn't want to come here.	Tsy te ho tonga eto izy.
Thanks, you don’t have to go there.	Misaotra, fa tsy mila ho any ianao.
Don't tell him.	Aza miteny aminy ve ianao.
Maybe he didn’t come.	Angamba tsy tonga izy.
There was a lot of water.	Nisy rano be.
It could be worse, you know.	Mety ho ratsy kokoa izany, fantatrao.
Tom looked away.	Nijery lavitra i Tom.
He was there.	Tao izy.
Maybe he really loves you.	Angamba tena tia anao.
They are so beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy izy ireo.
And that's how he got it.	Ary toy izany no azony.
You need money.	Mila vola ianao.
It’s not hard and it’s easy.	Tsy sarotra sy mora.
They may have an idea, and you can work on it.	Mety manana hevitra izy ireo, ary afaka miasa amin'izany ianao.
I quickly sat down.	Nipetraka haingana aho.
He is right, of course.	Marina ny azy, mazava ho azy.
Please tell me.	Lazao amiko azafady.
I will be good to you.	Ho tsara taminao aho.
I told him we needed more money.	Nolazaiko taminy fa mila vola bebe kokoa izahay.
I’m not used to being late for anything.	Tsy zatra tara na inona na inona aho.
He did a lot.	Be dia be ny nataony.
It's raining hard.	Mahery ny orana.
It will be difficult.	Ho sarotra izany.
They did not either.	Tsy nanao izany koa izy ireo.
I had to do something right.	Tsy maintsy nanao zavatra tsara aho.
That is who you are.	Izany hoe iza ianao.
Sorry you're going.	Miala tsiny fa mandeha ianao.
I have a very special opportunity.	Izaho manana fahafahana dia manokana.
You don’t have to be afraid.	Tsy mila matahotra ianao.
We may be unlucky.	Mety ho ratsy vintana isika.
About now.	Momba ny izao.
There again, yes.	Eo indray, eny.
He is coming soon.	Ho avy tsy ho ela izy.
And not just books.	Ary tsy boky fotsiny.
Couldn’t have traveled far without them.	Tsy afaka nandeha lavitra raha tsy nisy azy ireo.
We get off the road.	Miala amin'ny lalana izahay.
I don’t care about them.	Tsy miraharaha azy ireo aho.
I know you won't come.	Fantatro fa tsy ho avy ianao.
They are just not the same as you.	Tsy mitovy amin'ny anao fotsiny izy ireo.
I don't know.	Tsy fantany aho.
A little, anyway.	Kely, na ahoana na ahoana.
I thought about it.	Nieritreritra an'io aho.
You too.	Ianao koa.
It’s hard to tell if you’re not there.	Sarotra ny milaza raha tsy eo ianao.
What to do now ?.	Inona izao no hatao?.
I wrote.	Nanoratra aho.
We waited to see who would win.	Niandry izahay hoe iza no handresy.
I tried.	Niezaka aho.
Sounds fun.	Toa mahafinaritra.
But, it still didn’t work.	Saingy, mbola tsy nety ihany.
Everything.	Izao rehetra izao.
To me, he was about to live again.	Ho ahy dia efa ho velona indray izy.
And it could not come.	Ary tsy nety ho tonga izany.
The past is too much for me.	Be loatra amiko ny lasa.
I really like it.	Tena tiako.
What a wonderful little book.	Tena boky kely mahafinaritra.
That’s all.	Izany no zava-drehetra.
I tried to sleep, but couldn’t.	Niezaka natory aho, saingy tsy afaka.
But we did nothing.	Saingy tsy nanao na inona na inona izahay.

We think it’s that good.	Mihevitra izahay fa tsara toy izany.
I was surprised.	Gaga aho.
She is a beautiful child.	Zaza tsara tarehy izy.
Decided to leave.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hiala.
He understood it well.	Azony tsara izany.
That.	Izay.
But so is yours.	Fa toy izany koa ny anao.
He knows the type.	Fantany ilay karazana.
A true story.	Tantara tena misy.
We sat for a minute.	Nipetraka iray minitra izahay.
We can’t talk about that here.	Tsy afaka miresaka momba izany isika eto.
Don’t read too much about them.	Aza mamaky be loatra momba azy ireo.
And you have to be.	Ary tsy maintsy ho izany ianao.
Even for that, there was even.	Na ho an'izany, dia nisy mihitsy aza.
And there won’t be.	Ary tsy hisy.
And there he was again.	Ary teo indray izy.
I don’t remember the exact day.	Tsy tadidiko ny andro marina.
I've seen him before.	Efa nahita azy aho taloha.
Your location.	Ny toerana misy anao.
Yours must be a problem.	Tsy maintsy olana ny anao.
We don’t come to that question.	Tsy tonga amin'izany fanontaniana izany isika.
I don't see much.	Tsy dia hitako loatra.
I knew something was wrong.	Fantatro fa nisy zavatra tsy nety.
I was afraid to do anything.	Natahotra ny hanao na inona na inona aho.
I bought a new house.	Nividy trano vaovao aho.
I have never seen the accident.	Tsy mbola hitako mihitsy ilay loza.
They just watch.	Mijery fotsiny izy ireo.
He was often angry.	Matetika izy no tezitra.
He had never met her.	Mbola tsy nihaona taminy mihitsy izy.
He didn't stop or look at anything.	Tsy nijanona na nijery na inona na inona izy.
They are not the same as music.	Tsy mitovy amin'ny mozika izy ireo.
The food is ready.	Efa vonona ny sakafo.
I love being at home.	Tiako ny ao an-trano.
We fear the worst.	Matahotra ny ratsy indrindra izahay.
Maybe not so good.	Angamba tsy dia tsara.
I try as follows.	Miezaka toy ny manaraka aho.
That's where it went wrong.	Teo no tsy nety.
It may take a long time, but it doesn’t matter.	Mety ho lava be izany, saingy tsy maninona izany.
That's enough.	Ampy izay.
We can make more money when we work harder.	Afaka mahazo vola bebe kokoa isika rehefa miasa mafy kokoa.
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.
Of course, that didn’t help.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy nanampy izany.
No one entered or left the house.	Tsy nisy niditra na nivoaka ny trano.
It’s just always there.	Foana fotsiny izany.
I'm sure that's not the case.	Azoko antoka fa tsy izany no izy.
He went well.	Nandeha tsara izy.
He had many friends.	Nanana namana maro izy.
The same thing every day.	Ny zavatra mitovy isan'andro.
She is beautiful now.	Tsara tarehy izy izao.
He will not be lost.	Tsy ho very izy.
They could not stop.	Tsy afaka nijanona izy ireo.
I don't do this.	Tsy manao izao aho.
There are many reasons.	Maro ny antony.
It’s hard to know.	Sarotra ny mahafantatra.
With more to come.	Miaraka amin'ny mbola ho avy.
But you just don’t know, if you don’t know.	Saingy tsy fantatrao fotsiny, raha tsy fantatrao.
I am very angry.	Tezitra be aho.
He is not the only one who has done bad things here.	Tsy izy irery no nanao ratsy teto.
And of course they are.	Ary mazava ho azy fa izy ireo.
You are afraid of being lost.	Matahotra ny ho very ianao.
But, again, maybe not.	Saingy, indray, mety tsy.
I've seen him.	Efa nahita azy aho.
I could be another hour at least.	Mety ho adiny iray indray aho raha kely indrindra.
Like that.	Tahaka izany.
No, not you.	Tsia, tsy ianao.
People must have been angry with him.	Azo antoka fa tezitra taminy ny olona.
But still beautiful.	Saingy tsara tarehy ihany.
I can’t leave because we can get daily news now.	Tsy afaka miala aho satria afaka mahazo vaovao isan'andro isika izao.
If not, who knows.	Raha tsy izany dia iza no mahalala.
They will love us because of you.	Ho tia anay izy ireo noho ny aminao.
And this one seems to be real.	Ary ity iray ity dia toa tena misy.
It has to be done.	Tsy maintsy tanteraka izany.
I just saw it one day.	Vao nahita izany aho indray andro.
I see the right time to do that.	Hitako ny fotoana mety hanaovana izany.
And maybe they were right.	Ary nety angamba izy ireo.
And this book is really fun.	Ary tena mahafinaritra tokoa ity boky ity.
Of course it’s close here.	Mazava ho azy fa akaiky eto.
And it went a long way.	Dia nandeha lavitra be ilay izy.
This man is a man.	Lehilahy iray ity lehilahy ity.
You slept for over three days.	Natory nandritra ny telo andro mahery ianao.
These problems were difficult for him.	Sarotra taminy ireo olana ireo.
I have never met him.	Mbola tsy nihaona taminy aho.
Both seem to work.	Toa samy miasa ireo roa ireo.
We had a lot of fun.	Nahafinaritra be izahay.
Because he was lost.	Satria very izy.
He asked them if there was anything they didn’t like.	Nanontany azy ireo izy raha misy zavatra tsy tiany.
Yes, you don't know me.	Eny, tsy fantatrao aho.
I think these are the best things.	Heveriko fa ireo no zavatra tsara indrindra.
But no one told anyone why.	Saingy tsy nilaza na iza na iza ny antony.
He also did not apologize.	Tsy niala tsiny koa izy.
That is the way.	Izany no lalana.
This is not old.	Tsy taloha izany.
We just don’t need ours.	Tsy mila ny anay fotsiny izahay.
It's a disaster.	Loza izany.
He did it for himself.	Izy no nanao izany ho an'ny tenany.
I don’t remember doing that.	Tsy tadidiko ny nanao izany.
I want to do what is right.	Te hanao ny tsara aho.
Yes, this is the thing for you.	Eny, ity no zavatra ho anao.
And so is money.	Ary toy izany koa ny vola.
I also met him.	Nihaona taminy koa aho.
He does no wrong.	Tsy manao ratsy izy.
There may have been something wrong with us.	Mety ho nisy zavatra tsy nety taminay.
Who and many others.	Iza ary maro hafa.
I really want to get the point across.	Tena tiako ny mahazo ny antony.
Other types may come, and other dangers.	Mety ho avy ny karazana hafa, ary ny loza hafa.
In any case, it was nothing.	Na izany na tsy izany, tsy nisy na inona na inona izany.
He looks like you.	Toa anao izy.
It's all gone.	Very daholo.
It was just like a movie.	Toy ny sarimihetsika fotsiny ilay izy.
We are happy about that.	Faly izahay noho izany.
Who is speaking?	Iza no miteny?
They want to stay.	Te hijanona izy ireo.
Everything is fine.	Tsy maninona ny zava-drehetra.
I'm just used to it.	Efa zatra ihany aho.
But we don’t.	Saingy tsy manao izany izahay.
But it's not.	Saingy tsy izany.
This is wrong for many reasons.	Diso izany noho ny antony maro.
We will meet you again next time.	Mbola hihaona aminao indray isika amin'ny manaraka.
Too many don’t.	Betsaka loatra no tsy manao.
I don’t need him to be angry.	Tsy mila azy ho tezitra aho.
And maybe they were the only two then.	Ary angamba izy roa ihany no tamin'izany.
Thanks so much.	Misaotra indrindra.
And you’re not sure if you can help with those two issues.	Ary tsy azonao antoka raha afaka manampy amin'ireo olana roa ireo ianao.
He must have seen this letter.	Tsy maintsy nahita ity taratasy ity izy.
In fact, it has happened everywhere.	Efa nitranga na aiza na aiza izany, raha ny marina.
So, there we were.	Noho izany, teo izahay.
Finally, you seem angry.	Farany, toa tezitra ianao.
There is something for everyone here.	Misy zavatra ho an'ny rehetra eto.
That’s pretty true.	Somary marina izany.
All different places.	Toerana samy hafa rehetra.
Or buy us.	Na hividy anay.
It might work.	Mety miasa izany.
Or they are, for one person, somewhere.	Na izy ireo, ho an'ny olona iray, any ho any.
The question is when.	Ny fanontaniana dia hoe rahoviana.
They don’t even have that idea.	Tsy manana hevitra toy izany akory izy ireo.
Whatever it is, it’s not food.	Na inona na inona izany dia tsy sakafo izany.
At home.	Ao an-trano.
It was very long.	Tena lava be ilay izy.
His heart was in the right place.	Teo amin’ny toerana mety ny fony.
It's done.	Vita izao.
I know what he will do.	Fantatro izay hataony.
You have to stop.	Tsy maintsy mijanona ianao.
Indeed, we arrived two hours ago.	Eny tokoa, tonga ora roa lasa izay izahay.
And he didn't say that.	Ary tsy nilaza izany izy.
But he did not hear it.	Saingy tsy nandre izany izy.
Whoever it is.	Na iza na iza.
Everyone is happy, so happy.	Faly ny rehetra, faly loatra.
Not enough.	Tsy ampy.
He finally asked her to leave.	Nangataka azy handeha ihany izy.
And that's it.	Ary izany no izy.
I like that.	tiako izany.
I thought he was dead.	Noheveriko fa maty izy.
I’m sure you understand why.	Azoko antoka fa azonao ny antony.
I need sleep.	Mila torimaso aho.
He seemed surprised.	Toa gaga tamin’izany izy.
He was angry.	Tezitra izy.
Not so either.	Tsy izany koa.
It should not be the other and then the self.	Tsy tokony ho ny hafa ary avy eo ny tena.
No problem with the rain.	Tsy misy olana amin'ny orana.
Where have you been? 	Taiza foana ianao?
He was then able to get out.	Afaka nivoaka izy avy eo.
He didn't say much.	Tsy niteny firy izy.
I don't like it here anymore.	Tsy tiako intsony ny eto.
I love him though.	Tiako izy na izany aza.
We are confused.	Very hevitra izahay.
He went hard.	Nandeha mafy izy.
Then there was none.	Dia tsy nisy izany.
Can anyone help me with that please.	Misy afaka manampy ahy amin'izany ve azafady.
That is not what happened.	Tsy izany no nitranga.
It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona izany.
Right now it is.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia izany.
I love it so much.	Tiako loatra.
I have nothing for you.	Tsy manana na inona na inona ho anao aho.
Are you from here	Avy eto ve ianao?

Nothing happened.	Samy tsy nisy nitranga.
So you have to be really honest about it.	Noho izany dia tokony ho tena marina momba izany ianao.
It's too late.	Ela ny ela.
Not in any way, not at all times.	Tsy amin'ny fomba rehetra, tsy amin'ny fotoana rehetra.
They saw him a lot.	Nahita azy be dia be izy ireo.
The reason is too many people.	Ny antony dia olona maro loatra.
It helps all students.	Manampy ny mpianatra rehetra izany.
This weekend is going to be tough.	Ho sarotra ity faran’ny herinandro ity.
Then I learned to watch.	Dia nianatra nijery.
He did not either.	Tsy nanao izany koa izy.
It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona izany.
There have been no questions about it.	Tsy mbola nisy fanontaniana momba izany.
We cannot do great things alone.	Tsy afaka manao zavatra lehibe isika irery.
This is not his room.	Tsy ny efitranony io.
I have written about that time again.	Efa nanoratra momba an'io fotoana io indray aho.
I never did that.	Tsy nanao izany mihitsy aho.
And that was before.	Ary izany dia teo aloha.
It’s not too hard.	Tsy sarotra loatra izany.
I looked like a girl driving a car.	Nijery aho fa tovovavy mitondra fiara.

There was a new place for me.	Nisy toerana vaovao tamiko.
Real question.	Fanontaniana marina.

It worked well.	Niasa tsara izany.
Maybe you did.	Angamba ianao nanao izany.
He tried again.	Nanandrana indray izy.
But let's do it fast.	Fa aleo atao haingana.
It's too little now, too late.	Kely loatra izany ankehitriny, tara loatra.
He also has something about himself.	Misy zavatra momba azy koa izy.
We should all be happy.	Tokony ho faly isika rehetra.
But the next man.	Fa ny lehilahy manaraka.
I was not used to living outside.	Tsy zatra nipetraka tany ivelany aho.

I thought it was fun.	Nihevitra aho fa mahafinaritra.
It didn't work well.	Tsy nety tsara ilay izy.

It has to be more than that.	Tsy maintsy mihoatra noho izany.

Because there has to be someone.	Satria tsy maintsy misy olona.
Not until the end of the first month.	Tsy hatramin’ny faran’ny volana voalohany.

He saw it too and did nothing.	Nahita izany koa izy ary tsy nanao na inona na inona.
First.	Voalohany.
They lived in a small house.	Nipetraka tao amin’ny trano kely iray izy ireo.
I don't want to stay in this house.	Tsy te hijanona amin'ity trano ity aho.
I don’t know that many others will do the same.	Tsy fantatro fa maro hafa koa no hanao izany.
We are going on a short trip.	Handeha dia kely izahay.
I just need to know what it is.	Mila mahafantatra fotsiny aho hoe inona izany.
It is very easy to see why.	Tena mora ny mahita ny antony.
And then he.	Ary avy eo izy.
And it's still too late.	Ary mbola tara loatra.
I don't want him to see me.	Tsy tiako hahita ahy izy.
In fact, it is wrong.	Raha ny marina dia diso izany.
Tough, powerful words.	Teny sarotra, mahery.
Only the present.	Ny ankehitriny ihany no nisy.
I must go.	Tsy maintsy mandeha aho.
It took hours and hours.	Nandany ora sy ora tamin'izany.
I know all about cars.	Fantatro daholo ny momba ny fiara.
That time is over.	Efa lasa izany fotoana izany.
So we have to leave.	Ka tsy maintsy miala.
It must be different.	Tsy maintsy hafa izany.
That’s a lot.	Be dia be izany.
This item can be big or small.	Ity zavatra ity dia mety ho lehibe na kely.
He often doesn’t work.	Matetika izy no tsy miasa.
And he ate.	Dia nihinana izy.
He wondered about it.	Nanontany tena momba izany izy.
A small thing, at first.	Zavatra kely, tamin’ny voalohany.
I found no fault.	Tsy nahita fahadisoana aho.
We still do.	Mbola manao izany isika.
Tomorrow will be another difficult day.	Ho andro sarotra hafa indray ny rahampitso.
He seemed to want to help her.	Toa te hanampy azy izy.
He was in the car.	Tao anaty fiara izy.
In fact, he always had.	Raha ny marina dia nanana foana izy.
People are very happy.	Faly be ny olona.
We started in the morning.	Nanomboka ny maraina izahay.
As soon as we started, the place died down.	Raha vao nanomboka izahay dia maty ilay toerana.
You don’t just sit there and drink it.	Tsy mipetraka eo fotsiny ianao dia misotro izany.
Lots of fun stuff.	Be dia be ny zavatra mahafinaritra.
I will be happy no matter what.	Ho faly aho na inona na inona.
He heard nothing.	Tsy nandre na inona na inona izy.
People are crazy.	Adala ny olona.
This is done in two ways.	Izany dia atao amin'ny fomba roa.
It’s kind of completely new.	Karazana vaovao tanteraka izany.
This is a good problem.	Olana tsara izany.
I have never seen anything like it.	Mbola tsy nahita tahaka izany mihitsy aho.
I am a teacher.	Mpampianatra aho.
It’s not perfect yet.	Tsy mbola tanteraka.
It looks like rain.	Toa orana.
Then something happened.	Dia nisy zavatra.
I want to know.	tiako ho fantatra.
Not the least.	Tsy ny kely.
It has to stop.	Tsy maintsy mijanona izany.
He may not particularly like the job.	Mety tsy tiany manokana ilay asa.
I do it well.	Manao izany tsara aho.
I don't want to go there.	Tsy te ho any aho.
It was only once.	Indray mandeha ihany izany.
He is tough.	Mafy izy.
They are also new.	Vaovao ihany koa izy ireo.
I'm lost.	Very aho.
I really don’t see what that could be.	Tena tsy hitako izay mety ho izy.
We will easily win.	Handresy mora foana isika.
He was wrong.	Diso izy.
Maybe he had never seen it before.	Angamba mbola tsy nahita izany mihitsy izy.
It even tells the time.	Milaza ny fotoana mihitsy aza izany.
I love you now.	Tiako ianao izao.
But then he left.	Saingy lasa izy avy eo.
He is fast.	Haingana izy.
It is a very difficult task.	Asa tena sarotra izany.
It didn’t happen for a long time.	Tsy nitranga nandritra ny fotoana ela.
They didn’t have time.	Tsy nanana fotoana izy ireo.
We look forward to seeing you here.	Manantena ny hahita anao eto izahay.
I'm sure of that.	Azoko antoka izany.
Otherwise, he does nothing.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy manao na inona na inona izy.
It's been a week.	Herinandro izay.
And yes, there was.	Ary eny, nisy izany.
They do not walk alone.	Tsy mandeha irery izy ireo.
We could talk about anything.	Afaka niresaka na inona na inona izahay.
All of this seems old fashioned.	Izany rehetra izany dia toa fomba taloha.
Otherwise it doesn’t work.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy miasa.
He felt great.	Nahatsiaro tena ho lehibe izy.
Both are bad.	Samy ratsy.
I'm fine.	Tsy maninona aho.
You have to watch it.	Tsy maintsy mijery izany.
Which is not the same.	Izay tsy mitovy.
And so on.	Ary ny toy izany.
I wondered what would happen in two months.	Nieritreritra aho hoe inona no hitranga afaka roa volana.
They have to go.	Tsy maintsy mandeha izy ireo.
And that’s it, absolutely perfect.	Ary izay ihany, tanteraka tanteraka.
In fact, there are many teachers.	Raha ny marina, dia maro ny mpampianatra.
However, they are now two years old, at most.	Na izany aza, roa taona izy ireo izao, raha be indrindra.
It’s so beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy izy io.
There has never been such a problem before.	Tsy mbola nisy olana toy izany teo aloha.
He did not do so.	Tsy nanao toy izany izy.
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
Very special, very special.	Tena manokana, manokana loatra.
Next time.	Amin'ny manaraka.
It was a wonderful time.	Fotoana nahafinaritra izany.
He owned the house.	Nanana ny trano izy.
To not say anything about me.	Mba tsy hilaza na inona na inona momba ahy.
It's too long.	Lava loatra izany.
I know that’s not good.	Fantatro fa tsy tsara izany.
And it’s not like we have it anywhere.	Ary tsy toy ny hoe manana na aiza na aiza isika.
But, in any case.	Saingy, na ahoana na ahoana.
I don’t know what the first one was.	Tsy haiko hoe inona ilay voalohany.
This is a big mistake.	Fahadisoana lehibe izany.
Not enough money at the end of the month.	Tsy ampy ny vola amin’ny faran’ny volana.
Too little work.	Kely loatra ny asa.
In any case.	Na izany na tsy izany.
It would never be that bad.	Tsy ho ratsy toy izany mihitsy izany.
He didn't say either.	Tsy nilaza koa izy.
Someone can help me with that.	Misy afaka manampy ahy amin'izany.
We are very close.	Tena akaiky izahay.
And even more died than ever before.	Ary mbola betsaka kokoa noho ny teo aloha no maty.
It’s for himself.	Ho an'ny tenany manokana izany.
He is always late for school.	Tara foana izy rehefa mianatra.
And yes man.	Ary eny lehilahy.
I can see it all.	Afaka mahita izany rehetra izany aho.
Not what I thought they were.	Tsy izay noheveriko fa nisy azy ireo.
Absolutely not true.	Tsy marina tanteraka.
We’ve done that before.	Efa nanao izany izahay taloha.
Of course, everyone wants to come first.	Mazava ho azy fa samy te ho tonga aloha ny rehetra.
For the first few weeks it was an easy task.	Nandritra ny herinandro vitsivitsy voalohany dia asa mora izany.
It’s good, but not too big.	Tsara ilay izy, saingy tsy dia lehibe.
Will you be here next week?	Ho eto ve ianao amin'ny herinandro ambony?
I'm leaving tonight.	Handeha aho anio hariva.
It’s really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra tokoa izany.
It can't be.	Tsy mety ho izy.
I knew he was busy.	Fantatro fa sahirana izy.
In fact, it can be really bad.	Raha ny marina, mety ho tena ratsy izany.
Because there isn’t.	Satria tsy misy.
I will do it for you.	Hataoko anao izany.
I read about it.	Namaky momba izany aho.
In the end.	Amin'ny farany.
I thought there must be something ‘wrong’ with me.	Nihevitra aho fa tsy maintsy misy zavatra 'tsy mety' amiko.
I really love them and I want them to be happy.	Tena tiako izy ireo ary tiako ho faly izy ireo.
It seems impossible at all.	Toa tsy azo atao mihitsy izany.
See you soon!	Hihaona tsy ho ela!
I have to look at them and see what they are.	Tsy maintsy mijery azy ireo aho ary hijery hoe inona izy ireo.
This is often a problem.	Ity raha olana matetika.
It may never be done.	Mety tsy ho vita mihitsy.
And so should you.	Ary tokony ho toy izany koa ianao.
Not a little.	Tsy kely.
You want to learn something and they want to learn something too.	Te hianatra zavatra ianao ary te hianatra zavatra koa izy ireo.
Very happy with that.	Tena faly amin'izany.
Eventually the truth will come out.	Rehefa ela ny ela dia hivoaka ny marina.
This is a bad practice.	Fomba ratsy izany.
And so it is.	Dia toy izao izany.
Or you can stay where you are.	Na azonao atao ny mijanona amin'ny toerana misy anao.
While they are asleep.	Raha mbola matory izy ireo.
And that is not the way.	Ary tsy izany no lalana.
This is not true at all.	Tsy marina mihitsy izany.
I wrote this and it was really good.	Nanoratra ity ary tena tsara ilay izy.
The police will not come here.	Tsy ho avy eto ny polisy.
He also did not sleep through the night.	Tsy natory koa izy nandritra ny alina.
He really loves them.	Tena tiany izy ireo.
Are you okay	Tsara ve ianao.
He didn't think of anything else.	Tsy nieritreritra zavatra hafa izy.
There were children there for a minute or two.	Nisy ankizy teo nandritra ny iray na roa minitra.
But the question remains.	Fa ny fanontaniana mipetraka.
Much is unknown at this time.	Betsaka ny tsy fantatra amin'izao fotoana izao.
He’s a smart kid.	Zaza mahay izy.
The music is great.	Mahafinaritra ny mozika.
Don’t worry about timing.	Aza manahy momba ny fotoana.
It seems to have said so.	Toa nilaza izany.
I will not do more than that.	Tsy hataoko mihoatra azy.
They just don’t care.	Tsy miraharaha fotsiny izy ireo.
What’s next ?.	Inona no ho avy manaraka?.
He certainly did not.	Azo antoka fa tsy nanao izany izy.
He still has work to do.	Mbola misy asa tokony hataony.
Thanks for reading !!.	Misaotra namaky!!.
This is not a problem for me.	Tsy olana amiko izany.
I have a question.	Manana fanontaniana aho.
They had a reason.	Nanana antony izy ireo.
I will make a beautiful baby with her.	Hanao zaza tsara tarehy miaraka aminy aho.
They expect us to do the same.	Manantena antsika hanao izany koa izy ireo.
I'm waiting for him to come back.	Miandry azy hiverina aho.
This is the real story.	Ity ny tena tantara.
Two minutes.	Roa minitra.
Especially since he had the opportunity to be something completely different.	Indrindra satria nanana fahafahana ho zavatra hafa tanteraka izy.
We could have asked him.	Afaka nanontany azy izahay.
There are so many other things.	Be dia be koa ny zavatra hafa.
I thought it might be for you.	Nihevitra aho fa mety ho anao izany.
That, without it, I could not have learned.	Izany, raha tsy misy azy, dia tsy afaka nianatra izany.
I don’t have that man.	Tsy manana izany lehilahy izany.
I will be there then.	Ho any aho ary.
We found a new species.	Nahita karazana vaovao izahay.
It was fun every day.	Nahafinaritra isan'andro ilay izy.
They really work too.	Tena miasa koa izy ireo.

It becomes impossible.	Lasa tsy azo atao izany.

I found it quickly.	Nahita izany haingana aho.
But so are women.	Fa toy izany koa ny vehivavy.

Once in three it works like that.	Indray mandeha amin'ny telo dia miasa toy izany.
I have to go to work.	Tsy maintsy mandeha miasa aho.
He did not say why.	Tsy nilaza ny antony izy.
I'm confused.	Very hevitra aho.
I just want to live.	Te ho velona fotsiny aho.
He has no past and no future.	Tsy manana ny lasa sy ny ho avy izy.
He is always busy.	Be atao foana izy.
Another day, a few hours.	Andro hafa, ora vitsivitsy.
I am the best.	Izaho no tsara indrindra.
If he wants to.	Raha tiany.
Very dangerous.	Loza be.
I know it just sounds crazy but that’s what happened.	Fantatro fa toa adala ihany izany fa izay no nitranga.
He could not leave.	Tsy afaka niala izy.
She is a woman.	Vehivavy izy.
Really, really bad.	Tena, tena ratsy.
You need a better book.	Mila boky tsara kokoa ianao.
It would be perfect for a party.	Mety tsara amin'ny fety izany.
You should also know other places.	Tokony ho fantatrao koa ny toerana hafa.
I will never be so happy again.	Tsy ho faly toy izao intsony aho.

He has nothing.	Tsy manana na inona na inona izy.
There were no more accidents.	Tsy nisy loza intsony.
There really is.	Misy tokoa.
Very bad.	Tena ratsy.
This is a big house.	Trano lehibe ity.
He was looking at her now.	Nijery azy izy izao.
But we often do great.	Saingy matetika isika dia manao lehibe.

Like men and women.	Toy ny lehilahy sy vehivavy.
To me, it has it all.	Amiko dia manana ny zavatra rehetra izany.

In a country.	Amin'ny tany iray.

They then left the house.	Nivoaka ny trano izy ireo avy eo.

It will not happen.	Tsy ho tanteraka izany.
I was in the room.	Tao amin'ny efitrano aho.
We really want to do that work.	Tena te hanao izany asa izany izahay.
Yes, there is.	Eny, misy.
We ask from where.	Manontany avy aiza izahay.

He did not say how.	Tsy nilaza izy hoe ahoana.
Until the end of the year.	Hatramin'ny faran'ny taona.

In fact, they have a lot to lose.	Raha ny marina, be dia be ny ho very izy ireo.
But not too much.	Saingy tsy dia be loatra.
I know, but the question is why.	Fantatro, fa ny fanontaniana dia hoe nahoana.
So I will definitely be back here.	Ka azo antoka fa hiverina eto.
It's too far away.	Lavitra loatra izany.
Only you could do it for me.	Ianao ihany no afaka nanao izany ho ahy.

No book can do that for you.	Tsy misy boky afaka manao izany ho anao.
Well, that's not true.	Eny ary, tsy marina izany.
But it helps.	Saingy manampy izany.
I haven't seen it yet.	Mbola tsy hitako izany.

He knows what kind of them they are.	Fantany ny karazana azy ireo.
And new stories are old stories.	Ary ny tantara vaovao dia tantara taloha.
I was still sound asleep.	Mbola renoky ny torimaso tsara aho.

This is my favorite movie.	Ity no sarimihetsika tiako indrindra.
And they didn't.	Ary tsy nanao izany izy ireo.
And there are many things about it.	Ary misy zavatra maro momba izany.
More time passed.	Nandeha ny fotoana bebe kokoa.
The other three are indeed alive.	Velona tokoa ny telo hafa.
I wanted to get away from him.	Naniry ny hiala taminy aho.

They began to consider themselves very lucky.	Nanomboka nihevitra ny tenany ho tena tsara vintana izy ireo.
You have another book here.	Manana boky hafa ianao eto.
A former student died.	Mpianatra taloha iray no maty.
He must be crazy to think he won’t do it.	Tsy maintsy adala izy raha mieritreritra fa tsy hanao izany.
That is not the problem now.	Tsy izany no olana ankehitriny.
So it’s no different than at home.	Noho izany dia tsy misy hafa amin'ny ao an-trano.
There is no better word.	Tsy misy teny tsara kokoa.
It may be higher than that.	Mety ho ambony noho izany.
There was something else here as well.	Mbola nisy zavatra hafa koa teto.
We couldn’t talk about it.	Tsy afaka niresaka momba izany izahay.
I really like it with girls.	Tena tiako izany amin'ny tovovavy.
He doesn't ask for anything.	Tsy manontany na inona na inona izy.

Still you.	Mbola ianao ihany.
I could no longer do that.	Tsy afaka nanao izany intsony aho.

I had this.	Nanana ity aho.
He didn't say much before when he returned.	Tsy niteny firy izy taloha rehefa niverina.

And stay there anywhere for an hour or so.	Ary mijanona ao na aiza na aiza mandritra ny adiny iray na mihoatra.

It is not difficult to do so.	Tsy sarotra ny manao izany.
But there seemed to be no end to it.	Nefa toa tsy nisy farany taminy.
There really is.	Misy tokoa.
There is no one to help me.	Tsy misy olona hanampy ahy.
Can someone help me please ?.	Misy afaka manampy ahy ve azafady?.
I am very happy.	Tena faly aho.
I doubt he will come back.	Misalasala aho fa hiverina izy.
I know him better than you do.	Fantatro tsara noho ianao izy.
He is a teacher.	Mpampianatra izy.
If you buy it, you have it.	Raha mividy azy ianao dia manana azy.
I died there and then.	Maty teo aho ary avy eo.
Again, and again.	Indray, ary indray.
He made no mistake.	Tsy nanao fahadisoana izy.
They party late into the night.	Nanao fety izy ireo hatramin’ny alina be.
But history is not about that.	Saingy tsy momba izany ny tantara.
You’re just trying to help.	Miezaka manampy fotsiny ianao.
Once is enough.	Indray mandeha dia ampy.
And today is your first day.	Ary androany no andro voalohany anao.
He went to work.	Nandeha niasa izy.
There is no good from evil.	Tsy misy tsara avy amin'ny ratsy.
If they are, fine.	Raha izy ireo, tsara.
Thanks for the new words !.	Misaotra amin'ny teny vaovao!.
It’s too big for me.	Lehibe loatra amiko izany.
I loved children and thought of becoming a teacher.	Tiako ny ankizy ary nieritreritra ny ho lasa mpampianatra aho.
And there are dogs.	Ary misy alika.
I think you will become a good father.	Heveriko fa ho lasa ray tsara ianao.
They should know that.	Tokony ho fantany izany.
Maybe I should.	Izaho angamba no tokony.
I’m surprised to see you, actually.	Gaga aho mahita anao, raha ny marina.
But no one.	Fa tsy misy olona.
I want you to do that.	Tiako raha manao izany ianao.
We are very far away.	Lavitra be izahay.
I’ll be back in a few years, of course.	Mbola hiverina taona vitsivitsy aho, mazava ho azy.
I’m so glad you were able to do that.	Tena faly aho fa afaka nanao izany ianao.
If you say so.	Raha miteny izany ianao.
That’s how people are.	Toy izany ny olona.
Yes, it is easy to drink.	Eny, mora ny misotro.
But not the same.	Fa tsy mitovy.
No one else tried it again.	Tsy nisy nanandrana izany indray ny hafa.
That's a good word.	Teny tsara izany.
This place is good.	Tsara ity toerana ity.
I haven't played for over a week now.	Efa herinandro mahery aho izao no tsy nilalao.
Something could happen if he was still angry.	Mety hisy zavatra hitranga raha mbola tezitra izy.
That's the song.	Izay ilay hira.
I’ll be back soon, a week at most.	Tsy ho ela aho, herinandro raha be indrindra.
Or not from me.	Na tsy avy amiko.
It came out again that morning.	Nivoaka indray izy io maraina io.
But for now.	Fa amin'izao fotoana izao.
We have everything.	Manana ny zava-drehetra isika.
Didn't find one.	Tsy nahita iray.
There are two problems here.	Misy olana roa eto.
He has now done it.	Nahavita izany izy izao.
This is good and bad.	Tsara sy ratsy izany.
He didn't look very well.	Tsy nijery tsara izy.
I have to do what is necessary.	Tsy maintsy manao izay ilaina aho.
I hope this helped me.	Manantena aho fa nanampy ahy izany.
She is not very pretty.	Tsy dia tsara tarehy izy.
He is not very big.	Tsy dia lehibe loatra izy.
And a lot is lost.	Ary betsaka ny very.
He spoke quickly.	Niteny haingana izy.
So do we.	Toy izany koa isika.
I don't understand what it is.	Tsy azoko hoe inona izany.
But no, not before.	Saingy tsia, tsy teo aloha.
That’s a good idea.	Hevitra tsara izany.
The next meeting is next month.	Amin’ny volana ho avy izao ny fivoriana manaraka.
And you know that.	Ary fantatrao izany.
Yes, and yes and yes.	Eny, ary eny ary eny.
Absolutely wrong.	Tena diso tanteraka.
Friends who work on it.	Namana izay miasa amin'izany.
Either way, the end doesn’t seem to come.	Na izany na tsy izany, dia toa tsy ho tonga ny farany.
He was also very unloving.	Izy koa dia tena tsy tia.
She works from home.	Miasa amin'ny trano izy.
Now, everyone knows that.	Ankehitriny, fantatry ny rehetra izany.
I don't know how.	Tsy haiko hoe ahoana.
The man is stronger.	Ilay lehilahy no mahery kokoa.
These people need a lot of help, and where are we going.	Mila fanampiana betsaka ireo olona ireo, ary ho aiza izahay.
The food looks delicious.	Toa mahafinaritra ny sakafo.
Everyone was scared.	Natahotra ny olona rehetra.
In others, it is not.	Amin'ny hafa dia tsy izy.
He is not like that.	Tsy mba toy izany izy.
One wonders why he didn’t do another.	Manontany tena ny iray hoe nahoana izy no tsy nanao hafa.
He desperately wanted to go.	Naniry mafy ny handeha izy.
Apparently, this is not true.	Raha ny fantatra dia tsy marina izany.
I'm so glad to see you tonight.	Faly be aho nijery anao androany alina.
Which really worked for the story.	Izay tena niasa ho an'ny tantara.
There are many more.	Mbola misy maro hafa koa.
He says he has to leave.	Milaza izy fa tsy maintsy miala.
And of course it is.	Ary mazava ho azy izany.
The dress was wrong.	Tsy nety ny akanjo.
And he may still not be right.	Ary mety mbola tsy mety izy.
History.	Tantara.
I really like it.	Tena tiako io.
I'm going to do it now.	Handeha hanao izany aho izao.
You didn't write anything.	Tsy nanoratra na inona na inona ianao.
Maybe tomorrow.	Mety ho rahampitso.
There was little money.	Nisy vola kely.
It works really well.	Tena miasa tsara izany.
The same thing happened.	Toy izany koa no nitranga.
I started looking at everything at last.	Nanomboka nijery ny zava-drehetra tamin'ny farany.
I’m sure you do too.	Azoko antoka fa manao izany koa ianao.
Not a handsome man, but not ugly.	Tsy lehilahy tsara tarehy, fa tsy ratsy tarehy.
But there must be something.	Saingy tsy maintsy misy zavatra.
He can't ignore it.	Tsy afaka miraharaha an'izany izy.
It really happened.	Tena nitranga tokoa izany.
Things are different, now.	Hafa ny zavatra, ankehitriny.
It should be out in a month.	Tokony hivoaka afaka iray volana izany.
He seems clear to me.	Toa mazava amiko izy.
All he wanted to do was get out of there.	Ny hany tiany hatao dia ny miala ao.
It has already happened to me.	Efa nitranga tamiko izany.
They blamed him.	Nanome tsiny azy izy ireo.
I did something completely different.	Hafa mihitsy no vitako.
He wants to do it again, he needs another time.	Te hanao izany indray izy, mila fotoana hafa.
The problem is to find you wherever you are.	Ny olana dia hahita anao na aiza na aiza misy anao.
It helped us a lot.	Nanampy anay tsara izany.
Which might say something good about us.	Izay mety milaza zavatra tsara momba antsika.
No photos yet.	Tsy mbola misy sary.
They said it was true.	Nilaza izy ireo fa marina izany.
The place here is good.	Tsara ny toerana eto.
Is there a proper way.	Misy fomba mety ve.
Then there was it and it was true.	Dia nisy izany ary izany no marina.
This is because you may be lost.	Izany dia satria mety ho very ianao.
Thank you now.	Misaotra anao izao.
Only one of the first.	Iray amin'ireo voalohany ihany.
Another question.	Fanontaniana iray hafa.
Never assume that you know everything even if you have enough.	Aza mieritreritra mihitsy fa fantatrao ny zava-drehetra na dia ampy aza.
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.
Three students did not show up yesterday.	Mpianatra telo no tsy tonga omaly.
He wanted me to come talk to him.	Tiany ho avy hiresaka aminy aho.
But you don’t go crazy.	Fa tsy lasa adala ianao.
At that time, there was no one	Tamin'izany fotoana izany dia tsy nisy olona
We tried you know.	Nanandrana izahay fantatrao.
Sooner or later, the end will come out.	Na ho ela na ho haingana dia hivoaka ny farany.
And I didn’t think so either.	Ary tsy nieritreritra izany koa.
Only one was obtained.	Iray ihany no azo.
It was not easy for him to sleep.	Tsy mora taminy ny torimaso.
They are like us.	Tahaka antsika izy ireo.
It is a higher place.	Toerana ambony kokoa izy io.
They talk about something that happened to me.	Miresaka zavatra nitranga tamiko izy ireo.
What's the word again?	Inona indray ny teny?
This is the problem.	Io no olana.
And maybe not.	Ary angamba tsy afaka.
That's the song.	Izay ilay hira.
But there never seemed to be an opportunity.	Saingy toa tsy nisy fahafahana mihitsy.
You did not come.	Tsy tonga ianao.
It's been a week.	Herinandro teo no lasa.
No one ever thought that would happen.	Tsy nisy nieritreritra mihitsy hoe hitranga izany.
We will get out as soon as possible.	Hivoaka haingana araka izay azo atao izahay.
He really likes her more now.	Tena tiany kokoa izy izao.
And you have to do it.	Ary tsy maintsy manao izany ianao.

I take a good look at them.	Mijery tsara azy ireo aho.
I'm not crazy.	Tsy adala aho.
But how were they.	Saingy nanao ahoana izy ireo.
That is a good question.	Fanontaniana tsara izany.
I hope people will give us a chance.	Manantena aho fa hanome antsika fahafahana ny olona.
It was too late for us to help.	Tara loatra izahay vao afaka nanampy.
Then two things happened.	Nisy zavatra roa nitranga avy eo.
Don't say that.	Aza miteny toy izany.
Not too fast.	Tsy dia haingana loatra.
And talk to him.	Ary miresaka aminy.
And the house.	Ary ny trano.
It’s completely different.	Hafa tanteraka izany.
He was good to me.	Tsara tamiko izy.
Not really necessary.	Tsy tena ilaina.
I really wanted a woman.	Tena naniry vehivavy aho.
I really think something is wrong.	Tena heveriko fa misy zavatra tsy mety.
We are still too young.	Mbola kely loatra izahay.
I stopped and watched.	Nijanona aho dia nijery.
And things like that.	Ary ny zavatra toy izany.
The man was confused.	Very hevitra ilay lehilahy.
Probably no one tried them.	Azo inoana fa tsy nisy nanandrana izy ireo.
Others need to know this.	Mila mahafantatra izany ny hafa.
He will never be the same again.	Tsy ho toy ny taloha intsony izy.
The children were in the house.	Tao anaty trano ny ankizy.
The potential for that is great.	Lehibe ny mety ho an'izany.
He doesn't need to say anything.	Tsy mila miteny na inona na inona izy.
The kids said he loved me.	Nilaza ny ankizy fa tia ahy izy.
And he knew it could be different.	Ary fantany fa mety ho hafa izany.
They are both in the next room.	Ao amin'ny efitrano manaraka izy roa.
He thought he was doing what was really necessary.	Nihevitra izy fa manao izay ilaina tokoa.
He didn’t know what to do.	Tsy fantany izay tokony hatao.

This is easy to believe.	Mora inoana izany.
The water is still flowing.	Mbola mandeha ny rano.
They also stopped.	Nijanona koa izy ireo.
I have great news.	Manana vaovao lehibe aho.
Return to no.	Hiverina any amin'ny no.
He is very right.	Tena marina izy.
I felt like a little kid.	Nahatsiaro ho toy ny zaza kely aho.
Why, why, why.	Nahoana, nahoana, nahoana.
Because who you are.	Satria iza ianao.
Maybe you think that’s not possible.	Angamba ianao mihevitra fa tsy azo atao izany.
Both are fun.	Samy mahafinaritra.
He wanted them to go.	Tiany handeha izy ireo.
It should be a nice car anyway.	Tokony ho fiara mahafinaritra na izany na tsy izany.
That won't be a problem for me.	Tsy ho olana amiko izany.
They wanted him.	Naniry azy izy ireo.
They may be right or they may be wrong.	Mety ho marina izy ireo na mety tsy mety.
But there is a problem.	Saingy misy olana.
He wanted it.	Naniry izany izy.
And now the problem is clearer.	Ary izao dia mazava kokoa ny olana.
I do.	Ataoko.
We both needed it.	Samy nila izany izahay.
What he was doing seemed wrong.	Toa tsy nety ny zavatra nataony.
It’s really nice to talk to you.	Tena mahafinaritra ny miresaka aminao.
In other countries,.	Amin'ny tany hafa,.
I was wrong there.	Diso aho teo.
Don't swear at him.	Aza miteny ratsy azy.
That's not the case with me.	Tsy izany no izy amiko.
We are no longer used to them.	Tsy zatra azy ireo intsony isika.
You only get one.	Iray ihany no azonao.
I was there too.	Teo koa aho.
No, not just now.	Tsia, tsy vao izao.
Money could not buy it.	Tsy afaka nividy izany ny vola.
It’s really there for me.	Tena misy amiko izany.
Children will come.	Ny ankizy no ho avy.
The man now had a lot of work to do.	Nanana asa be dia be izao ilay lehilahy.
Here is one way.	Ity misy fomba iray.
Dogs eat almost anything.	Ny alika dia mihinana saika na inona na inona.
I will talk to your teacher.	Hiresaka amin'ny mpampianatra anao aho.
We thought you would be lost.	Nihevitra izahay fa ho very anao.
But they are things.	Saingy zavatra izy ireo.
We really need to work hard.	Tena mila miasa mafy isika.
We had to go.	Tsy maintsy nandeha izahay.
It doesn’t seem like much.	Toa tsy dia be loatra.
And so on throughout the night.	Ary toy izany mandritra ny alina.
Time is not money.	Tsy vola ny fotoana.
All the accidents happened.	Nitranga ny loza rehetra.

I'm sure of that.	Azoko antoka izany.
At the moment.	Amin'izao fotoana izao.
And it didn't work.	Ary tsy nety izany.

Did you have a good day?	Nanana andro tsara ve ianao?
That should be good news.	Tokony ho vaovao tsara izany.
They get more freedom.	Mahazo fahafahana bebe kokoa izy ireo.
I started talking to him.	Nanomboka niresaka taminy aho.

I hope he has a good trip.	Manantena aho fa manana dia tsara izy.
I never had that.	Tsy nanana izany mihitsy aho.

He can't.	Tsy azo atao izy.
He doesn't have enough money.	Tsy ampy vola izy.
No, not anymore.	Tsia, tsy misy intsony.
Maybe even at home.	Angamba na ao an-trano aza.
You don’t have to say anything about it.	Tsy mila milaza na inona na inona momba izany ianao.
I hope all goes well.	Manantena aho fa mandeha tsara ny rehetra.
We need to help people.	Mila manampy olona isika.

It’s a matter of money.	Zavatra iray momba ny vola izany.
They don't want to be with you.	Tsy te hiaraka aminao izy ireo.

And since it’s not good.	Ary hatramin'ny tsy tsara.
He should do it perfectly.	Tokony hanao izany tanteraka izy.
You go places and people are afraid of you.	Mandeha toerana ianao ary matahotra anao ny olona.

Lived there.	Nipetraka tao.

A little longer.	Somary lava kokoa.
Now she is too sick to leave the house.	Marary loatra izy izao ka tsy afaka ao an-trano.
However, not every day.	Na izany aza, tsy isan'andro.

Like they already knew they would be like that.	Toy ny efa fantany fa ho toy izany izy ireo.

I hope it’s done now.	Manantena aho fa vita izy izao.
But you will never find me again.	Fa tsy hahazo ahy intsony ianareo.

Time, that’s the problem.	Fotoana, izany no olana.
I will do everything as quickly as possible.	Hataoko haingana araka izay azo atao ny zava-drehetra.
All the children looked at him.	Nijery azy ny ankizy rehetra.

Then we will be back.	Dia hiverina izahay.
I looked at the girl.	Nijery ilay tovovavy aho.

Luck is not the cause.	Ny vintana dia tsy antony.
Then he came.	Dia tonga izy.

Or here too.	Na eto koa.

You are a great man.	Lehilahy lehibe ianao.

And then comes the problem.	Ary dia tonga amin'izany ny olana.
He was the only one left there.	Izy irery no nijanona teo.
And there is no next but only time.	Ary tsy misy ny manaraka fa ny fotoana ihany.
It sounds crazy.	Toy ny adala izany.
You work two.	Miasa roa ianao.

Then a year passed.	Dia lasa ny taona iray.
We had never seen that before.	Mbola tsy nisy nahita an’izany taminy izahay teo aloha.
I didn’t try it last night.	Tsy nanandrana an'io aho omaly hariva.
He had a hard day.	Nanana andro sahirana izy.

Will you study drawing?	Hianatra ny sary ve ianao?

But yours is right.	Fa marina ny anao.
It goes instant and real.	Lasa eo no ho eo sy tena izy.

He really loves me, you know.	Tena tia ahy izy, fantatrao.
I could never say what.	Tsy afaka nilaza mihitsy aho hoe inona.
It could happen with music, or something else.	Mety hitranga amin'ny mozika izany, na zavatra hafa.
Often busy.	Be atao matetika.
No one came out.	Tsy nisy nivoaka.
Dogs have it.	Alika manana izany.
Of course, the bigger they are the better.	Mazava ho azy fa ny lehibe kokoa izy ireo no tsara kokoa.
It shouldn’t be wrong.	Tsy tokony ho diso.
I don’t want to do that anymore.	Tsy te hanao izany intsony aho.
Did he do it.	Izy ve no nanao azy.

I have no children.	Tsy misy zaza amiko.
Just like you did.	Toy ny nataonao.
This one went better.	Nandeha tsara kokoa ity iray ity.
I'll just go out.	Hivoaka fotsiny aho.
There is still much to be done.	Mbola betsaka ny tokony hatao.

It all didn’t work out for me.	Tsy nety tamiko izany rehetra izany.

He likes to be busy and useful.	Tiany be atao sy ilaina.
Not even higher.	Tsy mbola ambony kokoa.
He didn't look at me, he looked at the dog.	Tsy nijery ahy izy, nijery ny alika.
He was full of questions.	Feno fanontaniana izy.
The accident made it impossible for me to walk.	Nahatonga ahy tsy afaka nandeha ilay loza.
But no one is here.	Saingy tsy misy olona eto.
Which is true in a way.	Izay marina tamin'ny fomba iray.
I can’t help but wonder what he knows.	Tsy azoko atao ny manontany tena hoe inona no fantany.

I can't die here.	Tsy mety maty eto aho.
Can anyone please help.	Misy afaka manampy ve azafady.

We were glad they went.	Faly izahay fa nandeha izy ireo.
The truth is no one cares too much.	Ny marina dia tsy misy miraharaha loatra.

But if it’s big.	Fa raha lehibe izany.
It just doesn’t stop there.	Tsy mijanona fotsiny izany.
The music is good.	Tsara ny mozika.
In others.	Amin'ny hafa.
Then he looks away.	Dia mijery lavitra izy.
What he can do.	Izay azony atao.
He looked at me.	Nijery ahy izy.
I’ve talked to girls like me before.	Efa niresaka tamin'ny tovovavy toa ahy taloha.
There shouldn’t be too much to ask.	Tsy tokony ho be loatra ny manontany.
I waited for them.	Niandry azy ireo aho.

Don't tell me.	Aza miteny amiko.
Just an idea.	Hevitra ihany.
It really helped.	Tena nanampy tokoa izany.
Maybe we arrived too early in the year.	Angamba tonga aloha loatra izahay tamin'ny taona.
That’s all good.	Tsara daholo izany.
Only you still don’t know it.	Ianao ihany no mbola tsy mahafantatra izany.
And only when something goes wrong.	Ary rehefa misy zavatra mandeha ihany.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra ilay izy.

But there was nothing there.	Saingy tsy nisy na inona na inona tao.
I will not give it to him.	Tsy hanome azy aho.
Patients and methods.	Ny marary sy ny fomba.
Very nice to know you.	Faly be ny mahafantatra anao.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Tsy misy fotoana hanaovana na inona na inona momba izany.
He expects a lot from me.	Manantena betsaka amiko izy.
But when she was little, she was a very beautiful girl.	Fa fony izy mbola kely, dia tovovavy tena tsara tarehy.
He had heard it.	Efa nandre izany izy.
He will do all the work.	Izy no hanao ny asa rehetra.

However, there are possible ideas.	Na izany aza, misy hevitra azo atao.
This may not be entirely true.	Mety tsy marina tanteraka izany.
So that's probably what happened.	Ka mety izay no nitranga.

But immediately his teacher came.	Fa avy hatrany dia tonga ny mpampianatra azy.
Often not for the best.	Matetika tsy ho an'ny tsara indrindra.

It's not that he wants to be with her now.	Tsy hoe te hiaraka aminy izy izao.
If anything, it becomes more difficult.	Raha misy, dia lasa sarotra kokoa.
It really isn’t there.	Tena tsy ao izany.
I just got out.	Vao nivoaka aho.

Which still works today.	Izay mbola miasa ankehitriny.

He had to wonder what it would be like to be real.	Tsy maintsy nanontany tena izy hoe hanao ahoana ny tena izy.
And it's not.	Ary tsy izany.
When we entered.	Rehefa niditra izahay.
We are happy to have you with us this week.	Faly izahay manana anao miaraka aminay amin'ity herinandro ity.
Or, you know.	Na, fantatrao.
It’s not just about him.	Tsy momba azy fotsiny izany.
He now knew what was going to happen, and he knew he wanted it.	Fantany izao izay hitranga, ary fantany fa tiany izany.
But more often than not, this is not possible.	Saingy matetika kokoa noho ny tsy, dia tsy azo atao izany.
No, not people.	Tsia, tsy olona.
It worked once.	Niasa indray mandeha izany.
They don’t have to be a big problem either.	Tsy voatery ho olana lehibe koa izy ireo.
Otherwise, we do nothing.	Raha tsy izany dia tsy manao na inona na inona izahay.
He started with a small job.	Nanomboka tamin'ny asa kely izy.
Whoever,.	Na iza na iza,.
They planned to return in two hours.	Nikasa hiverina izy ireo afaka adiny roa.
I think it will go well.	Heveriko fa handeha tsara izany.

So it doesn’t work.	Noho izany dia tsy mandeha izany.
He asked if he could call again.	Nanontany izy raha afaka niantso indray izy.
Too much is still unclear.	Be loatra no mbola tsy mazava.
You won't be long.	Tsy ho ela ianao.

And they did so.	Dia nanao izany izy ireo.
Not just mine.	Tsy ny ahy ihany.
You can be the same.	Mety ho toy izany koa ianao.
He knew he wasn't.	Fantany fa tsy izy.
Which he did, of course.	Izay nataony, mazava ho azy.
I don't understand why he didn't come.	Tsy azoko hoe nahoana izy no tsy tonga.
He was dead, dead badly.	Efa maty izy, maty ratsy.
We need some time to do that.	Mila fotoana kely isika hanaovana izany.
That's good.	Tsara izany.
It’s almost like sleeping at home.	Saika toy ny matory ao an-trano.
We can't stay long.	Tsy afaka mijanona ela isika.

There will be no space.	Tsy hisy toerana.
He drank a lot.	Nisotro be izy.
It sounds fun.	Toa mahafinaritra izany.
That can't happen.	Tsy mety hitranga izany.
Just a little bit.	Kely fotsiny.
It was really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra tokoa ilay izy.
With a few close friends.	Miaraka amin'ny namana akaiky vitsivitsy.
I worked for them for many years.	Niasa ho azy ireo aho nandritra ny taona maro.
There is no need to talk about it now.	Tsy ilaina ny miresaka an'izany ankehitriny.
Ignore me.	Aza miraharaha ahy.
He had been waiting for it.	Efa niandry izany izy.
As with both.	Toy ny tamin'ny roa.
No one has heard of me.	Tsy nisy nandre momba ahy.
It has happened again.	Efa nitranga indray izany.
Already out.	Efa nivoaka.

Surely someone will find out.	Azo antoka fa hisy hahita.
He is a small man.	Lehilahy kely izy.
You enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra anao izany.
Doing one or one, but not both, is not enough.	Ny fanaovana ny iray na ny iray, fa tsy izy roa, dia tsy ampy.
Even though he lived alone, he easily made friends.	Na dia nipetraka irery aza izy, dia nahazo namana mora foana.
I don't know how.	Tsy haiko ny fomba.
Often.	Matetika.
Everything must be ready.	Tsy maintsy vonona ny zava-drehetra.

He.	Izy.
One is older than the other.	Ny iray dia be taona kokoa noho ny iray hafa.
He left this morning.	Niala izy androany maraina.

A lot of people aren’t ready to get everything and it doesn’t matter.	Betsaka ny olona tsy vonona ny hahazo ny zava-drehetra ary tsy maninona izany.
We will go back there now.	Hiverina any isika izao.
Another said.	Niteny ny iray hafa.
Because of me.	Noho ny amiko.
It may not be the same as me, it may not be the same as yours.	Mety tsy mitovy amin'ny ahy izany, mety tsy mitovy amin'ny anao.
But it didn’t help.	Saingy tsy nanampy izany.
But it’s fair to wonder.	Saingy marina ny manontany tena.
Maybe more than that.	Mety mihoatra noho izany.
They haven’t had it yet.	Tsy mbola nanana izany izy ireo.

They love them too.	Tia azy ireo koa izy ireo.
It works as follows.	Izany dia miasa toy izao manaraka izao.
Everything else, he does well.	Ny zavatra hafa rehetra, manao tsara izy.
I'm not going for that.	Tsy handeha amin’izany aho.
There were times when everything seemed really bad.	Nisy fotoana dia toa tena ratsy tokoa ny zava-drehetra.
I got two reasons.	Nahazo antony roa aho.
He just got it.	Vao azony izany.
You need to think fast.	Mila mieritreritra haingana ianao.
He doesn't understand much, in the end.	Tsy azony loatra, amin’ny farany.
He stopped.	Nijanona izy.
No one.	Tsy misy olona.
He couldn't think of that now.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra izany izy izao.
And he may be right.	Ary mety ho marina izy.
They are not there.	Tsy ao izy ireo.
It can also be wrong.	Mety ho diso koa izany.
He is very easy.	Mora be izy.
And it's too late.	Ary tara loatra.

He did nothing wrong.	Tsy nanao ratsy izy.
But now it is gone too.	Fa izao koa dia lasa.
But this time.	Fa ity indray mandeha ity.

I want them to live.	Tiako ho velona izy ireo.
There could have been no mistake.	Tsy nety ho nisy fahadisoana.
Where were you?	Taiza ianao?
I remember we had a real car.	Tadidiko fa nanana fiara tena izy izahay.
It’s hard, but you can learn.	Sarotra izany, saingy afaka mianatra ianao.
You should come one night.	Tokony ho tonga indray alina ianao.
He never saw it.	Tsy nahita mihitsy izy.
Many women will tell you that this is the most suitable job.	Vehivavy maro no hilaza aminao fa io no asa mety indrindra.
Who knows how many people.	Iza no mahalala hoe firy ny olona.

I knew he was there somewhere.	Fantatro fa ao izy any ho any.
I don’t remember what exactly.	Tsy tadidiko hoe inona marina.

Of course you’ve heard that.	Mazava ho azy fa efa nandre izany ianao.
So now is the time to act.	Koa izao no fotoana tokony hanaovana asa.
That must be true.	Tsy maintsy marina izany.
And that's the idea.	Ary izay no hevitra.
Like this guy.	Toy ity lehilahy ity.
You can’t take you and the man.	Tsy afaka mitondra anao sy ny lehilahy ianao.
You are not grown up yet.	Tsy mbola lehibe ianao.
That's far.	Lavitra izany.

No one looked good.	Tsy nisy nijery tsara.

You are right about that.	Marina ny anao momba izany.
So are many, many other similar issues.	Toy izany koa ny maro, olana maro hafa toy izany.

This is wrong.	Diso izany.
They did a good job of him.	Nanao asa tsara taminy izy ireo.

It was also not easy to communicate.	Tsy mora koa ny niresaka.
Better not.	Aleo tsy manao.
They are still many.	Mbola betsaka ihany izy ireo.
And they watch.	Ary mijery izy ireo.
Wherever you want.	Na aiza na aiza tianao.

They are already here.	Efa teto izy ireo.
She's not sure what's real.	Tsy azony antoka izay tena izy.
Very easy indeed.	Tena mora tokoa.
Not that he said much.	Tsy hoe niteny be izy.
I was surprised at first that he thought he had to ask.	Gaga aho tamin'ny voalohany fa nihevitra izy fa tsy maintsy manontany.
A few books.	Boky vitsivitsy.
And the story is good.	Ary tsara ny tantara.
You know, if you want to be with me, fine.	Fantatrao, raha te hiaraka amiko ianao, tsara.

I want to do that now.	Te hanao izany aho izao.
But someone was there, fine.	Saingy nisy olona teo, tsara.
I have a very good reason.	Manana antony tena tsara.
He sat up, confused.	Nipetraka izy, very hevitra.
She is the same age as him even though he is younger.	Efa mitovy taona aminy izy na dia kely kokoa aza.
We will help this especially for you.	Hanampy izany indrindra ho anao izahay.
They have never existed and may not exist.	Tsy mbola nisy izy ireo ary mety tsy hisy.
I'm looking for these ideas.	Mitady ireo hevitra ireo aho.

We’ve certainly done that before.	Azo antoka fa efa nanao izany izahay taloha.
Anyway, here they are.	Na izany na tsy izany, eto izy ireo.
He went too far.	Lasa lavitra izy.
We did what he wanted.	Nanao izay tiany izahay.
Yes, he did.	Eny, nanao izany izy.
I need to do something about it.	Mila manao zavatra amin'izany aho.
If you do, you will lose a lot.	Raha manao izany ianao dia ho very betsaka.
And he really liked it.	Ary tena tiany izany.
I looked closer.	Nijery akaiky kokoa aho.
I think there is a reason for that.	Heveriko fa misy antony izany.
Why they don’t know, and right now it doesn’t matter.	Nahoana no tsy fantany, ary amin'izao fotoana izao dia tsy maninona izany.
We will be glad to see you.	Ho faly izahay mahita anao.
He looked at her in surprise.	Gaga izy nijery azy.
That could be wrong.	Mety ho diso izany.
He didn’t seem to have much.	Toa tsy nanana firy izy.
Books are no different.	Tsy misy hafa amin'izany ny boky.
But he didn’t have much luck.	Saingy tsy dia nanana vintana firy izy.
Just to watch you.	Mba hijery anao fotsiny.
Of course, there is no surefire way.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy misy fomba azo antoka.
Without you, it will not be possible.	Raha tsy misy anao dia tsy ho tanteraka izany.
I looked.	Nijery aho.
I will leave too.	Izaho koa hiala.
He stopped.	Nijanona izy.
I may be wrong.	Mety ho diso hevitra aho.
I didn’t look at the others.	Tsy nijery ny hafa aho.
He is not afraid of me.	Tsy matahotra ahy izy.
You are busy.	Sahirana ianao.
Talked about work.	Niresaka momba ny asa.
And she, as she already knew would be beautiful.	Ary izy, araka ny efa fantany fa ho tsara tarehy.
He wanted me to go.	Tiany handeha aho.
I have done everything possible.	Efa nataoko daholo izay azo atao.
They both really want to see him.	Tena te hahita azy izy roa.
I’m learning the hard way.	Mianatra ny fomba sarotra aho.
So, the reason is luck.	Noho izany, ny antony vintana.
It was very difficult.	Tena sarotra be ilay izy.
Then he started walking.	Dia nanomboka nandeha izy.
This is the right place for him.	Io no toerana mety aminy.
We had a few.	Nanana vitsivitsy izahay.
They certainly aren’t for me.	Azo antoka fa tsy ho ahy izy ireo.
But that’s all in fact.	Fa izany rehetra izany raha ny marina.
For you.	Ho anao.
I am that girl.	Izaho io tovovavy io.
At first we thought it was a good idea.	Tamin'ny voalohany dia nihevitra izahay fa hevitra tsara izany.
He talked to me all night.	Niresaka tamiko nandritra ny alina izy.
Don't go the wrong way, please.	Aza mandeha amin'ny lalana diso, azafady.
It's too hard.	Sarotra loatra izany.
Which didn’t happen.	Izay tsy nitranga.
They seemed to see something bigger to do.	Toa nahita zavatra lehibe kokoa tokony hatao izy ireo.
They will never tell you that you did a good job.	Tsy hilaza aminao mihitsy izy ireo fa nanao asa tsara ianao.
A lot, in fact.	Betsaka, raha ny marina.
It could be anyone.	Mety ho na iza na iza.
The three of us did it.	Telo izahay no nanao izany.

The food is good.	Tsara ny sakafo.
This is a very exciting opportunity.	Ity dia fahafahana tena mahafinaritra.

I'm not his.	Tsy azy aho.
He didn’t know why it scared him, but it was.	Tsy fantany hoe nahoana izany no natahotra azy, fa izany no izy.
It was a wonderful time.	Fotoana nahafinaritra tokoa izany.
So, sleep doesn’t come.	Noho izany, tsy tonga ny torimaso.
We don’t do that.	Tsy manao izany izahay.
I make more money than he does.	Mahazo vola bebe kokoa noho izy aho.
Then again, he and I are the same age.	Avy eo indray, izaho sy izy dia mitovy taona.
However, I had a better idea.	Na izany aza, nanana hevitra tsara kokoa aho.
He had to have it.	Tsy maintsy nanana azy izy.
I don’t want to do anything special.	Tsy te hanao zavatra manokana aho.
No one saw anything.	Tsy nisy nahita na inona na inona izy ireo.
However, many questions remain.	Na izany aza, maro ny fanontaniana mipetraka.

Absolutely not.	Tena tsy izany.
He decided to check it out.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hijery izany izy.
A lot of people work long hours here.	Betsaka ny olona miasa ora maro eto.

But it doesn’t work.	Saingy tsy miasa izany.
But he is good.	Fa tsara izy.

It was far away.	Lavitra ilay izy.

The latter.	Ity farany.
Then he was free.	Dia afaka izy.
You need to be more polite.	Mila mahalala fomba kokoa ianao.
I read about it.	Mamaky momba izany aho.
You know them, you see them, others lose because of them.	Fantatrao izy ireo, nahita azy ireo ianao, very ny hafa noho izy ireo.
He seems to be completely lost now.	Toa very hevitra tanteraka izy izao.
In fact, it’s okay to think you’re not.	Raha ny marina, mety tsara ny mihevitra fa tsy ianao.
This, finally, is very important for the patient.	Izany, farany, dia tena ilaina ho an'ny marary.
Not everything is always bad.	Tsy voatery ho ratsy foana ny zava-drehetra.
I believe he loves me too.	Mino aho fa tia ahy koa izy.
It’s not going to happen, it’s never going to happen.	Tsy hitranga, tsy mety hitranga mihitsy.
I can't do anything about it.	Tsy afaka manao na inona na inona momba izany aho.
So, good job.	Noho izany, asa tsara.
Good man.	Lehilahy tsara.
I just want to tell you the good news.	Te hilaza aminao ny vaovao tsara fotsiny aho.
He was no longer in his room.	Tsy tao amin’ny efitranony intsony izy.

They are probably the best players.	Izy ireo angamba no mpilalao tsara indrindra.
Already up there.	Efa tany ambony.
He has never left today.	Mbola tsy niala mihitsy izy androany.
Maybe they weren’t too big to ask for too much.	Sao dia samy tsy lehibe loatra ka nangataka be loatra.

And good luck.	Ary tsara vintana.

He could have spent the money on something more fun.	Afaka nandany ny vola tamin’ny zavatra mahafinaritra kokoa izy.
He doesn’t know what’s coming next, he’s not real.	Tsy fantany izay ho avy manaraka, tsy tena izy.

I don’t think so.	Tsy mieritreritra an'izany aho.
He was just a handsome man.	Lehilahy tsara tarehy fotsiny izy.
Everything will be lost over time.	Ho very ny zava-drehetra rehefa mandeha ny fotoana.
Maybe if you just ignore it, you’ll be fine.	Angamba raha tsy miraharaha azy fotsiny ianao dia ho tsara.
You seem to be afraid of everything.	Toa matahotra ny zava-drehetra ianao.
He also didn’t have a chance to learn from one.	Tsy nanana fahafahana hianatra avy amin'ny iray koa izy.
This seems unbelievable.	Toa tsy azo inoana izany.
We have already seen them.	Efa nahita azy ireo izahay.
No one helped me.	Tsy nisy olona nanampy ahy.
I am still like that.	Mbola toy izany foana aho.
It was near the front.	Teo akaiky teo aloha ilay izy.
However, we did.	Na dia izany aza, dia nanao izany izahay.
We should have learned.	Tokony nianatra izahay.
Women have learned to be like men.	Nianatra ny ho tonga tahaka ny lehilahy ny vehivavy.
So I have to.	Ka tsy maintsy izaho.
This weekend has been a lot of fun.	Nahafinaritra be ity faran'ny herinandro ity.
We see them almost every day.	Saika isan’andro izahay no mahita azy ireo.
I wonder about that.	Manontany tena aho momba izany.
That's good.	Tsara izany.
I hope you can drive.	Manantena aho fa afaka mitondra fiara ianao.
He is not an actor.	Tsy mpilalao sarimihetsika izy.
I don’t know how he was.	Tsy haiko hoe nanao ahoana izy.
I felt crazy.	Nahatsiaro tena ho adala aho.
The policeman helps them find their way home.	Manampy azy ireo hahita ny lalana hody ilay polisy.
Raha te ho.	Raha te ho .
If different.	Raha samy hafa.
Then it was gone.	Dia lasa izany.
First, thank you for everything you do.	Voalohany, misaotra amin'ny zavatra rehetra nataonao.
I don't understand the question.	Tsy azoko ilay fanontaniana.
I haven't seen them in two years.	Roa taona aho no tsy nahita azy ireo.
He did it tonight.	Nanao izany izy androany alina.
Better now.	Aleo amin'izao fotoana izao.
But don't wait for me.	Fa aza miandry aho.
Talk about it.	Miresaka momba izany.
I don't know what to do.	Tsy hitako izay hatao.
Especially since he wasn’t too scared, and he wasn’t scared.	Indrindra fa tsy dia natahotra loatra izy, ary tsy natahotra.
We really believe in you.	Tena mino anao izahay.
Tomorrow night, you come.	Rahampitso alina, tonga ianao.
Here I am just drinking.	Eto aho vao misotro.
He was where he was.	Teo amin’ny toerana nisy azy izy.
And it scared me.	Ary natahotra ahy izany.
I had to wait.	Tsy maintsy niandry aho.
Almost everyone.	Saika ny rehetra.
Of course, there were many good people too.  	Mazava ho azy fa nisy olona tsara maro koa.  
People want to do what is right.	Te hanao ny tsara ny olona.
I didn't see anything.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona aho.
Everyone was scared.	Natahotra ny rehetra.
I believe I still have a lot to do.	Mino aho fa mbola betsaka ny zavatra tokony hataoko.
I stopped too.	Nijanona koa aho.
I always talked to him.	Niresaka taminy foana aho.
They did not see him.	Tsy nahita azy izy ireo.
Maybe there's a reason, please.	Sao dia mba misy azafady izay mety ho antony.
I can't do it now.	Tsy vitako izao.
I'm really scared of that.	Tena matahotra an'izany aho.
There is nothing to do.	Tsy misy tokony hatao.
All that or not.	Izany rehetra izany na tsia.
I saw it right there.	Hitako teo mihitsy.
Playing with her children.	Milalao miaraka amin'ny zanany.
This year it should be.	Amin'ity taona ity dia tokony ho izy.
Yes, maybe you are now.	Eny, angamba ianao izao.
Or you can tell us what you know.	Na azonao atao ny milaza aminay izay fantatrao.
Enough for him.	Ampy ho azy.
You can't stay.	Tsy afaka mijanona ianao.
It’s just not safe at all.	Tsy azo antoka mihitsy izany.
In fact, he was certainly right.	Raha ny marina, azo antoka fa marina izy.
The night was wonderful.	Nahafinaritra ny alina.
I see something else I like about them.	Mahita zavatra hafa tiako aho momba azy ireo.
They both didn’t stay long.	Samy tsy nijanona ela izy ireo.
Maybe they did.	Angamba nanao izany izy ireo.
This house.	Izao trano izao.
There wasn’t much space either.	Tsy nisy toerana be koa.
It’s like everything.	Toy ny zava-drehetra izany.
It was perfect.	Tena nety izany.
It was not necessary.	Tsy nila izany.
He was never afraid.	Tsy natahotra mihitsy izy.
I hoped he was.	Nanantena aho fa izy no izy.
And for good reason.	Ary noho ny antony lehibe.
Then again it was the weekend when I really got to know him.	Avy eo indray dia faran'ny herinandro vao tena fantany aho.
Everything should be very easy.	Tokony ho mora be ny zava-drehetra.
He was certainly not a man there.	Azo antoka fa tsy lehilahy eny izy.
But don’t worry, you get this.	Fa aza manahy, azonao ity.
It will be hard to leave when done.	Ho sarotra ny hiala rehefa vita.
They returned.	Niverina izy ireo.
So we are done.	Noho izany dia vita isika.
There was more than that.	Nisy mihoatra noho izany.
This may help if anyone needs it.	Mety hanampy izany raha misy mila.
Now I have found two things about it.	Ankehitriny dia nahita zavatra roa momba izany aho.
Mine is the first.	Ny ahy no voalohany.
Glad, no, it's not.	Faly, tsia, tsy izany.
We love them, and they love us.	Tia azy ireo isika, ary tia antsika koa izy ireo.
I'm fine too.	Mety koa aho.
Mine is yours.	Ny ahy dia anao.
He always wanted to give her everything.	Te hanome azy ny zava-drehetra foana izy.
This is a great car.	Fiara lehibe ity.
He probably did.	Azo inoana fa nanao izany izy.
Bad day, good day.	Andro ratsy, andro tsara.
It came out well today.	Nivoaka tsara androany.
When you say that, you don’t have to say anything else.	Rehefa nilaza izany ianao dia tsy mila miteny zavatra hafa.
He talked a little bit about it.	Niresaka kely momba izany izy.
He felt like a little kid again.	Nahatsiaro ho toy ny zaza kely indray izy.
The new route was completed quickly.	Vita haingana ny lalana vaovao.
He should not be left alone.	Tsy tokony hijanona irery izy.
He had no friends to play with.	Tsy nanana namana nilalao izy.
It's too far away.	Lavitra loatra izany.
John had to leave.	Tsy maintsy niala i John.
He’s not about to make the same mistake.	Tsy saika hanao fahadisoana mitovy amin'izany izy.
He wanted it for another reason.	Naniry izany noho ny antony hafa izy.
It works in other ways as well.	Miasa amin'ny fomba hafa koa izany.
But it doesn’t have to be.	Saingy tsy voatery izany.
Good.	Tsara.
Well, well, that’s good.	Tsara, tsara, tsara izany.
I work for him.	Miasa aminy aho.
That's too much.	Be loatra izany.
It seems more like a man.	Toa mihoatra noho ny lehilahy izany.
All these ages and ages.	Ireo taona sy taona rehetra ireo.
The road always stopped.	Nijanona foana ny lalana.
That’s the hard part.	Izay no sarotra.
I really like it.	Tena tiako izany.
It’s just a matter of what to do.	Asa fotsiny hoe inona no atao.
He refused to give up.	Tsy nety niala tamin’izany izy.
Which, of course, won’t be.	Izay, mazava ho azy, tsy ho izy.
I think he should have remembered them.	Heveriko fa tokony ho nahatsiaro azy ireo izy.
We played well.	Nilalao tsara izahay.
It all seems like a long time ago.	Toa efa ela be izany rehetra izany.
Then we went for a drink.	Dia nandeha nisotro izahay.
Yes, he was there.	Eny, teo izy.
But something doesn’t help.	Saingy misy zavatra tsy manampy.
I had never heard anything like it.	Mbola tsy nandre zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho.
I often love jobs that are very different from mine.	Matetika aho no tia asa izay tena hafa noho ny ahy.
Don’t think too much about it.	Aza mieritreritra loatra izany.
There is no reason either.	Tsy misy antony koa.
I just left.	Niala fotsiny aho.
Don't worry.	Aza manahy.
It has to be now.	Tsy maintsy ho izy izao.
We thought so, though.	Nihevitra izany izahay, na izany aza.
It’s more complicated.	Sarotra kokoa izany.
And women are men.	Ary ny vehivavy dia lehilahy.
I am very angry.	Tezitra be aho.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Azoko antoka fa hiverina izy.
However.	Na izany aza.
I was surprised but very happy to go.	Gaga aho nefa tena faly nandeha.
I read it too.	Namaky an'io koa aho.
Maybe a little more.	Angamba kely kokoa.
I find this unbelievable.	Hitako fa tsy azo inoana izany.
It is difficult but impossible.	Sarotra ilay izy fa tsy azo atao.
Played, played, played.	Nilalao, nilalao, nilalao.
Here and everywhere.	Eto ary na aiza na aiza.
She now lives at home.	Mipetraka ao an-trano izy izao.
He spoke alone.	Niresaka irery izy.
But the real problem is very complex.	Fa ny tena olana dia tena sarotra.
He looks very different.	Toa hafa mihitsy izy.
He seemed happy.	Toa faly izy.
Does anyone know how to play? 	Misy mahay milalao ve?
You can't leave.	Tsy afaka miala ianao.
Here he is happy.	Eto izy dia faly.
Sorry that's it.	Miala tsiny fa izay no izy.
And this is what happened.	Ary izao no nitranga.
You have been here.	Efa teto ianao.
Just for the reason of ignoring it now.	Noho ny antony tsy miraharaha azy izao fotsiny.
Already done.	Efa nanao.
You get angry again, don't you? 	Lasa tezitra indray ianao, sa tsy izany?
It didn’t come out like that.	Tsy nivoaka toy izany.
This is his favorite thing.	Izany no tena tiany indrindra.
We may have been busy seeing you.	Mety ho sahirana izahay nahita anao.
He doesn't know which way.	Tsy fantany izay lalana.
I love them.	Tiako izy ireo.
He is the same age as me.	Efa mitovy taona amiko izy.
That's far.	Lavitra izany.
Strong woman.	Vehivavy mafy.
They just do.	Manao fotsiny izy ireo.
He thought.	Nieritreritra izy.
He should have been to the meeting.	Tokony ho tany amin'ny fivoriana izy.
The news is not true.	Tsy marina ny vaovao.
I could be more, be better.	Mety ho bebe kokoa aho, ho tsara kokoa.
Does it help ?.	Manampy ve izany?.
He did not and asked if it was necessary.	Tsy nanao izany izy ary nanontany raha ilaina izany.
I don't care.	Tsy miraharaha aho.
Probably everything.	Angamba ny zava-drehetra.
No one said what he would do.	Tsy nisy nilaza izay mety hataony.
The same thing happened to another man.	Toy izany koa ny lehilahy iray hafa.
This is not mine.	Tsy ahy ity.
This is the last one.	Ity no farany.
What happened is what happened.	Ny zava-nitranga dia ny zava-nitranga.
No problem.	Tsy hisy olana.
So don’t hesitate to point out any mistakes.	Koa aza misalasala milaza ny fahadisoana rehetra.
I think that’s the question, now.	Heveriko fa izany no fanontaniana, ankehitriny.
All these other stupid things.	Ireo zavatra adala hafa rehetra ireo.
I would never do such a thing.	Tsy hanao zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho.
Hope you get the idea.	Manantena anao hahazo ny hevitra.
Of course, that was not the case when the player said that.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izany no nitranga rehefa nilaza izany ilay mpilalao.
They did not expect anything good.	Tsy nanantena zavatra tsara izy ireo.
And this is one of those times.	Ary izao no iray amin'ireo fotoana.
I don't know why he is so angry.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana izy no tezitra be.
Everything seems completely different now.	Toa hafa tanteraka ny zava-drehetra ankehitriny.
He no longer thought.	Tsy nieritreritra intsony izy.
Not fun.	Tsy mahafinaritra.
Of course, that is the case.	Mazava ho azy fa izany no izy.
That's the idea.	Izany no hevitra.
I want to talk to you a little bit.	Te hiresaka kely aminao aho.
I want to leave too.	Te hiala koa aho.
Yes, whatever.	Eny, na inona na inona.
They were late.	Tara nipetraka izy ireo.
I never saw him.	Tsy hitako mihitsy izy.
It didn't seem real.	Toa tsy tena nisy ilay izy.
It will be the same as before.	Ho toy ny taloha izany.
We have two things for you.	Manana zavatra roa izahay ho anao.
He wants to get out, and he wants to get out now.	Te hivoaka izy, ary te hivoaka izy izao.
He didn't even need to try.	Tsy nila nanandrana akory izy.
Otherwise, it is too late to do anything about it.	Raha tsy izany dia tara loatra ny hanao na inona na inona momba izany.
He was too big for himself.	Lehibe loatra ho an'ny tenany izy.
I hope they are.	Manantena aho fa izy ireo.
A little something too.	Zavatra kely koa.
We think nothing is lost.	Mihevitra izahay fa tsy misy very.
He finally told me that.	Tamin'ny farany dia nilaza tamiko izany izy.
You may have heard that.	Mety ho efa nandre izany ianao.
I arrived.	Tonga aho.
Now, one last chance.	Ankehitriny, vintana farany.
Maybe you can help her?	Angamba afaka manampy azy ianao?
The music speaks for itself.	Ny mozika no miresaka.
Not here, not from him.	Tsy eto, tsy avy aminy.
I buy a lot of books.	Mividy boky be dia be aho.
And people are.	Ary ny olona dia.
We must read it.	Tsy maintsy mamaky azy io isika.
You can do it as long as we have you.	Afaka manao izany ianao raha mbola manana anao izahay.
And they don’t talk much about it.	Ary tsy dia miresaka momba izany izy ireo.
He’s as bad as you didn’t know before.	Ratsy toy ny tsy fantatrao taloha izy.
I needed him to be with me.	Nila azy ho eo amiko aho.
All the other children had to play.	Tsy maintsy nilalao daholo ny ankizy hafa.
I saw him clearly then.	Hitako tsara izy avy eo.
Surely you know.	Azo antoka fa fantatrao.
All of these things seem to come at once.	Toa tonga indray mandeha ireo zavatra rehetra ireo.
I need to go first.	Mila aloha aho.
But we need to bring them together.	Saingy mila mitondra azy ireo miaraka isika.
The last few months have been really hard for the two of us.	Tena mafy taminay roa ny volana vitsivitsy lasa izay.
We were really scared of kids.	Tena natahotra ny ankizy izahay.
Whatever may happen.	Na inona na inona mety hitranga.
One or two.	Iray na roa.
Everything went well with us today, but we worked on it.	Nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra taminay androany, saingy niasa tamin'izany izahay.
They are not clearly known or really known.	Tsy fantatra mazava na tena mahafantatra izy ireo.
It will not go away.	Tsy hiala izany.
I always love to travel.	Tiako foana ny dia lavitra.
Mine is one of those two.	Ny ahy dia iray amin'ireo roa ireo.
No, it's gone.	Tsia, lasa izany.
In this picture.	Amin'ity sary ity.
I have always loved him.	Efa tia azy foana.
I'm not real yet.	Mbola tsy tena aho.
He finally arrived.	Tonga ihany izy tamin'ny farany.
In water.	Amin'ny rano.
Then, we can play.	Avy eo, afaka milalao isika.
They always go.	Mandeha foana izy ireo.
That is obvious.	Mazava loatra izany.
The place here is really beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy ny toerana eto.
But it took too long.	Fa ela loatra izany.
They are not stupid.	Tsy adala izy ireo.
I still had them.	Mbola nanana azy ireo aho.
And you have to help me.	Ary tsy maintsy manampy ahy ianao.
This is not really a problem.	Tsy tena olana izany.
He wanted water but did not ask.	Naniry rano izy fa tsy nangataka.
I'm going to check.	Mandeha aho hijery.
He seemed troubled to see it clearly.	Toa sahirana izy nahita izany mazava tsara.
He is still dead.	Mbola maty izy.
But it should be possible.	Saingy tokony ho azo atao izany.
He could be something.	Mety ho zavatra iray izy.
We will never see it, no matter what.	Tsy hahita izany mihitsy isika, na inona na inona.
I'm glad he's here.	Faly aho fa eto izy.
He was waiting for me.	Niandry ahy izy.
I have a lot to lose.	Be dia be ny ho very aho.
And many years ago.	Ary taona maro lasa izay.
I can know everything.	Afaka mahafantatra ny rehetra aho.
He was like a child.	Toy ny zaza izy.
That seems wrong.	Toa diso izany.
They were just lucky.	Tsara vintana fotsiny izy ireo.
It's like this.	Toy izao izany.
You will get there.	Hahazo eny ianao.
Meet at their location.	Hihaona amin'ny toerana misy azy ireo.
I was really scared of him.	Tena natahotra azy aho.
We talked.	Niresaka izahay.
Three years ago.	Telo taona lasa izay.
Together they helped him.	Niaraka nanampy azy izy ireo.
It was like yesterday to me.	Toy ny omaly izany tamiko.
It is never too late to be happy.	Mbola tsy tara ny ho faly.
I know now that none of this is true.	Fantatro izao fa tsy misy marina izany.
You haven’t tried it.	Tsy nanandrana izany ianao.
But it will take years.	Saingy mila taona maro izany.
You need to try harder.	Mila miezaka mafy kokoa ianao.
We are in the water.	Ao anaty rano izahay.
Of course, he could be wrong.	Mazava ho azy, mety ho diso izy.
This party is especially suitable for children.	Ity fety ity dia mety indrindra ho an'ny ankizy.
They can’t be.	Tsy mety ho izy ireo.
There are many other routes as well.	Misy lalana maro hafa koa misy.
This is very bad.	Tena ratsy izany.
They do the same.	Manao toy izany izy ireo.
You need it today.	Mila izany ianao anio.
We have never done that before.	Tsy mbola nanao izany intsony izahay.
I knew he was gone too.	Fantatro fa lasa koa izy.
It is early in the morning.	Vao maraina ny andro.
The more things, the better.	Ny zavatra betsaka kokoa, ny tsara kokoa.
You are both very good people.	Samy olona tena tsara ianareo.
This is completely wrong.	Diso tanteraka izany.
It is no more.	Tsy misy intsony izany.
I didn’t think so.	Tsy nieritreritra izany aho.
Spending time with friends.	Mandeha ny fotoana miaraka amin'ny namana.
It’s something else entirely.	Zavatra hafa mihitsy izany.
I don't think so.	Heveriko fa tsy izany.
It was a little small.	Kely kely ilay izy.
But now they are gone.	Saingy efa lasa izy ireo izao.
We are with him.	Miaraka aminy izahay.
There was good and bad.	Nisy ny tsara sy ny ratsy.
Too often.	Matetika loatra.
It is still night.	Mbola alina ny andro.
They are fun, but not necessary.	Mahafinaritra izy ireo, saingy tsy ilaina.
It seems so.	Toa izany.
To do anything about it.	Mba hanao na inona na inona momba izany.
I hope you all had a great party.	Manantena aho fa nanao fety mahafinaritra ianareo rehetra.
They need a different approach.	Mila fomba hafa izy ireo.
At that time, it was a long time ago.	Tamin'izany fotoana izany, efa ela be izao.
You should all come.	Tokony ho tonga daholo ianareo.
You felt free.	Nahatsiaro ho afaka ianao.
He needed to look at me.	Nila nijery ahy izy.
I try not to think.	Miezaka tsy mieritreritra aho.
He went to his private room.	Nankany amin'ny efitranony manokana izy.
It’s not better than all your other ideas.	Tsy tsara noho ny hevitrao hafa rehetra izany.
It is not a real job.	Tsy asa tena izy io.
He decided he was different from everyone else.	Nanapa-kevitra fa hafa noho ny hafa izy.

He said he had no idea.	Nilaza izy fa tsy manana hevitra.

It’s hard.	Sarotra izany.
And he will.	Ary hanao izany izy.
Don't do that.	Aza manao izany.
None of this is true.	Tsy misy marina izany.
I do wrong.	manao ratsy aho.
All these years.	Ireo taona rehetra ireo.
In this letter.	Amin'ity taratasy ity.
This is really crazy.	Tena adala tokoa izany.
The idea is as follows.	Ny hevitra dia izao manaraka izao.

He is used to working abroad.	Efa zatra miasa any ivelany izy.
There is a reason for this.	Misy antony izany.
It used to be impossible.	Zavatra tsy azo atao izany taloha.

I didn’t even look at the others.	Tsy nijery ny hafa akory aho.
This one is definitely back.	Niverina tokoa ity iray ity.
He is all of us now.	Izy no antsika rehetra amin'izao fotoana izao.
Here we are.	Eto izahay.
He didn’t like it, and he wondered if it was true.	Tsy tiany izany, ary nanontany tena izy raha marina izany.

I'm sure it won't be a problem.	Azoko antoka fa tsy ho olana izany.

I know the problem!	fantatro ny olana!
No one spoke to him either.	Tsy nisy olona niresaka taminy koa.

Let's come first.	Aleo tonga aloha.
It doesn’t look bad.	Tsy toa ratsy izany.

The house is just as bad as it is.	Ratsy tahaka azy ihany ny trano.
that.	izay.
Just a bad thing.	Zavatra ratsy ihany.
And they talked about it.	Ary niresaka momba izany izy ireo.

I came back very well.	Niverina aho tsara be.
They can see it and help us find it.	Afaka mahita izany izy ireo ary manampy antsika hahita izany.

It has already begun.	Efa nanomboka izany.
See you tomorrow.	Rahampitso indray.
But that is not the case.	Saingy tsy izany no izy.

And the potential is more the same.	Ary ny mety ho bebe kokoa ny mitovy.
Of course, he was very sick.	Mazava ho azy fa narary mafy izy.

You want to do everything right.	Te hanao tsara ny zava-drehetra ianao.

Of course you have.	Mazava ho azy fa manana ianao.
Or if so, no one told me.	Na raha izany no izy dia tsy nisy nilaza tamiko.

I don't think that's the case.	Heveriko fa tsy izany no izy.
Kind of a pretty little place.	Karazana toerana kely tsara tarehy.

But you are very different.	Fa tena hafa mihitsy ianao.
He didn't have to go now.	Tsy nila nandeha izy izao.
I am a man of words.	Olona teny aho.
I was there again.	Teo indray aho.
That’s the idea, though.	Izany no hevitra, na izany aza.
So do you know that song?	Ka fantatrao ve io hira io?
Not far either.	Tsy lavitra koa.
And anyone can do it.	Ary na iza na iza afaka manao izany.
Couldn't speak loudly.	Tsy afaka niteny mafy.
I looked but saw no luck.	Nijery aho fa tsy nahita vintana.

It is not easy for him.	Tsy mora aminy izany.
Not a pretty picture.	Tsy sary tsara tarehy.

That’s one of the things.	Izany no iray amin'ireo zavatra.
He did not understand what was happening.	Tsy azony ny zava-nitranga.
He has always been good to you.	Tsara taminao foana izy.
I can ask you too.	Afaka manontany anao koa aho.
We agree.	Mitovy hevitra ihany izahay.
So, that’s what he wanted to do.	Noho izany, izany no tiany hatao.
I had to think fast.	Tsy maintsy nieritreritra haingana aho.
Especially if you are a woman.	Indrindra raha vehivavy ianao.
It could be that and many more.	Mety ho izany sy ny maro hafa.
In fact, they did.	Raha ny marina dia nanao izany izy ireo.
It will not.	Tsy hanao izany.
Even a little.	Na kely aza.

I don't remember him.	Tsy tadidiko izy.
If he was fast and skilled.	Raha haingana sy nahay izy.
I always think of him.	Mieritreritra azy foana aho.
I needed to hear him say that.	Nila nandre azy nilaza izany aho.
I stopped to help him.	Nijanona aho mba hanampy azy.
It really should.	Tena tokony.
And he.	Ary izy.
After three.	Rehefa afaka telo izany.
He is not too happy when he arrives late.	Tsy faly loatra izy rehefa tonga tara.
This is someone who is interested in me for a specific reason.	Olona liana amiko ity noho ny antony manokana.
I haven't done that yet.	Tsy mbola nanao izany aho.
He is too fast for others.	Haingana loatra ho an’ny hafa izy.
That is not what happened to me.	Tsy izany no nitranga tamiko.
Then we asked him first if there was a problem with that.	Dia nanontany azy aloha izahay fa nisy olana tamin'izany.
That is not enough.	Tsy ampy izany.
It’s just hard to do.	Sarotra ihany ny manao izany.
You don’t like it.	Tsy tianao izany.
They can't play.	Tsy afaka milalao izy ireo.
And it was me.	Ary izaho izany.
I got it, one night.	Azoko izany, indray alina.
Not everyone has it.	Tsy izy rehetra no manana.
Not available.	Tsy misy.
If he likes these, he will come back to you.	Raha tiany ireo dia hiverina aminao izy.
But this one works really well.	Saingy ity iray ity dia tena miasa tsara.

I can't say when.	Tsy afaka milaza aho hoe rahoviana.
They played and came back.	Nilalao izy ireo ary niverina.
But this coming weekend.	Fa ny faran’ny herinandro ho avy io.

He did a lot for me.	Betsaka ny zavatra nataony tamiko.

This place is great.	Lehibe io toerana io.
He was just here.	Teto fotsiny izy.
No one was free.	Tsy nisy afaka.
But he said it would not happen.	Saingy nilaza izy fa tsy hitranga izany.
Three children died.	Ankizy telo no maty.
Because they wouldn’t know.	Satria tsy ho fantany.
That seems to be true.	Toa marina izany.
I’m not even sure it’s possible.	Tsy azoko antoka akory fa azo atao izany.
The weather today is good.	Tsara ny andro androany.
I also like that approach, you know.	Tiako koa izany fomba izany, fantatrao.

A few others might be good.	Mety ho tsara ny vitsivitsy hafa.
I was expecting more, in fact.	Nanantena kokoa aho, raha ny marina.
Exactly the same.	Mitovy tanteraka.

Some say it's just a movie.	Misy milaza fa sarimihetsika fotsiny ilay izy.

The same is true.	Toy izany koa.
It is not too late.	Mbola tsy tara izany.
Timing was flawless.	Tsy nisy tsiny ny fotoana.
If you don’t get it now, you will never get it.	Raha tsy azonao izao dia tsy ho azonao mihitsy.
So are the men, thank you.	Toy izany koa ny lehilahy, misaotra.

Or he tried to ask.	Na niezaka nanontany izy.
Can't wait.	Tsy afaka miandry.

I have work to do.	Manana asa hatao aho.
I'm afraid it's lost.	Matahotra aho fa very izany.
And you can just see it.	Ary afaka mahita izany fotsiny ianao.
Just the truth.	Ny marina ihany.

It took a lot of time.	Nandany fotoana be tamin'izany.
They did not steal.	Tsy nangalatra izy ireo.
But you haven’t seen those sick pictures yet.	Saingy tsy mbola nahita ireo sary marary ireo ianao.
They will come out.	Hivoaka izy ireo.
And if something goes wrong.	Ary raha misy zavatra tsy mety.
He wanted more, he needed more.	Naniry bebe kokoa izy, mila bebe kokoa.
I don’t know why he doesn’t speak.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana izy no tsy miteny.
There was not much news then.	Tsy dia nisy vaovao firy tamin'izany.
But no one stopped.	Saingy tsy nisy nijanona.
It was so beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy ilay izy.
He just worked.	Niasa fotsiny izy.
This is often not true.	Tsy marina izany matetika.

There is still something to be done.	Mbola misy zavatra tokony hatao.
I told him it was a good job.	Nolazaiko taminy fa asa tsara.

You are helping us now.	Manampy anay izao ianao.
He thought a little about what he should do.	Nieritreritra kely momba izay tokony hataony izy.
Finally, he will come.	Farany, ho tonga izy.
I enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra ahy izany.
However, you never think this will happen to you.	Na izany aza, tsy mieritreritra mihitsy ianao fa hitranga aminao izany.
I doubt they will ever come back.	Misalasala aho raha mbola hiverina indray izy ireo.
You stop drinking.	Tsy misotro intsony ianao.
I know that very well.	Fantatro tsara izany.
Then it was all gone.	Dia lasa ny rehetra.
You will be.	Ianao dia ho.
He never said why.	Tsy nilaza mihitsy izy hoe nahoana.
It was as if he always had to apologize.	Toy ny hoe tsy maintsy niala tsiny foana izy.
They now have money.	Nahazo vola izy ireo izao.
The idea is good.	Tsara ilay hevitra.
This is not new to me.	Tsy vaovao amiko izany.

Two more follow.	Roa hafa no manaraka.
He was unconscious.	Tsy nahatsiaro tena izy.
It will never happen.	Tsy hisy mihitsy izany.
One is not very good.	Tsy dia tsara loatra ny iray.
We are very worried about that.	Tena manahy momba izany izahay.
Only one worked.	Iray ihany no niasa.
Often, you don’t care.	Matetika, tsy miraharaha an'izany ianao.
Sure we can talk now if you like.	Azo antoka fa afaka miresaka isika izao raha tianao.
I think it came too late.	Heveriko fa tonga tara loatra izany.
Like never before.	Toy ny tsy nisy mihitsy.
We have a good one.	Manana iray tsara izahay.
They did nothing.	Tsy nisy nanao na inona na inona izy ireo.
But, that’s it.	Saingy, izany no izy.
In the end, it’s too easy to go too far.	Amin'ny farany, mora loatra ny mandeha lavitra.
That question is very good.	Tena tsara izany fanontaniana izany.
I tried to go to him.	Niezaka nankany aminy aho.
He does not care about us.	Tsy miraharaha antsika izy.
And the last one is mine.	Ary ny farany dia ny ahy.
The people he loves always become dead.	Ny olona tiany dia lasa maty foana.
It scared me.	Natahotra ahy izany.
This is often not true.	Matetika dia tsy marina izany.
I had a reason.	Nanana antony aho.
The book is full of beautiful illustrations.	Feno sary tsara tarehy ilay boky.
If you stay at three you are done.	Raha mijanona amin'ny telo ianao dia vita.
Of the party.	An'ny fety.
Yes, there seems to be something we are missing.	Eny, toa misy zavatra tsy ampy antsika.
Not that you were there.	Tsy hoe nisy ianao.

There are many things that can be done.	Misy zavatra maro azo atao.
From almost none.	Avy saika tsy nisy.

Maybe he should just go and get one.	Angamba tokony handeha fotsiny izy ary hahazo iray.
Can anyone do that.	Misy afaka manao izany ve.
We were so scared, scared of losing you.	Natahotra be izahay, natahotra ny ho very anao.
He wondered if he would get there.	Nanontany tena izy raha ho tonga any.

This is probably the right thing to do.	Mety io no mety.
He said he knew.	Nilaza izy fa fantany.
But when he tried them, they weren’t too fast.	Saingy rehefa nanandrana azy ireo izy, dia tsy dia haingana loatra.

This is the worst.	Io no ratsy indrindra.

If there are many, there is a problem with the method.	Raha misy maro, misy olana amin'ny fomba.

I went back to that.	Niverina tamin’izany aho.
And it’s good to do that.	Ary tsara ny manao izany.
He spent the weekend with us.	Nandany ny faran'ny herinandro niaraka taminay izy.
Then there is nothing you will miss.	Avy eo dia tsy hisy zavatra tsy ho azonao.

They work, but could be better.	Miasa izy ireo, saingy mety ho tsara kokoa.
I still had work to do.	Mbola nanana asa tokony hatao aho.
I had to.	Tsy maintsy nataoko.
For he has watched.	Fa efa nijery izy.
We are stronger than you.	Mahery noho ianao izahay.
It really helps.	Tena manampy izany.
I know him well.	Fantatro tsara izy.
Once upon a time, it was really fun to have someone with me.	Indray mandeha, tena nahafinaritra tokoa ny nanana olona niaraka tamiko.
It’s a really fun place to be.	Tena toerana mahafinaritra ho azy io.
In fact, he didn’t know.	Raha ny marina, tsy fantany.
He lived to be thirty years old.	Velona telopolo taona izy.
Children will come.	Ny ankizy no ho avy.
There were no books.	Tsy nisy boky.

That seems pretty clear.	Toa mazava tsara izany.
I love working there.	Tiako ny miasa ao.

It will be done, too.	Ho vita koa izany.
But then again, that doesn’t seem like a good idea.	Saingy indray izany dia toa tsy misy hevitra tsara.

They couldn’t say much about him.	Tsy afaka nilaza zavatra betsaka momba azy izy ireo.

It will never happen again.	Tsy hitranga intsony izany.

I need it to survive.	Mila izany aho mba ho velona.
It was a fun party.	Nisy fety nahafinaritra.
But when he spoke, it was different.	Fa rehefa niteny izy, dia hafa ilay izy.

Still waiting to see what happens.	Mbola miandry izay hitranga.
I didn’t have much.	Tsy nanana be dia be.

Will people never leave?	Tsy hiala intsony ve ny olona?

There were absolutely no problems with the car.	Tena tsy nisy olana mihitsy tamin'ny fiara.
He just hoped it wasn’t.	Nanantena fotsiny izy fa tsy izy io.
For two years, he spent a lot of money.	Nandritra ny roa taona, dia nandany vola be.
There was something.	Nisy zavatra.
We planned to meet before the end of the year.	Nikasa ny hihaona izahay alohan'ny faran'ny taona.
I know the girl.	Fantatro ilay tovovavy.
He quickly got dressed and left the house.	Nanao akanjo haingana izy ary nivoaka ny trano.
And the good news is, you can get away with it.	Ary ny vaovao tsara dia, afaka miala amin'izany ianao.
He could not think of others.	Tsy afaka nihevitra ny hafa izy.
I wonder where he lives now.	Manontany tena aho hoe aiza izy izao no mipetraka.

I really like it.	Tena tiako.

But that’s three.	Saingy telo izany.
We will not give you the money.	Tsy hanome anao ny vola izahay.
He died.	Maty izy.

Maybe he should go back home.	Angamba tokony hiverina any an-trano izy.

That could not be true.	Tsy mety ho marina izany.

He doesn’t do anything for me.	Tsy manao na inona na inona ho ahy izy.
I just read this book.	Vao avy namaky an’io boky io aho.
But about that.	Saingy ny momba izany.

It was like being a child again.	Toy ny hoe mbola zaza indray izany.
And it will.	Ary hanao izany.
You need to know them.	Mila fantatrao izy ireo.

Time wasted.	Fotoana very.
Either way, that’s the job.	Na izany na tsy izany, izany no asa.

I guess we disagree on that.	Ataoko fa tsy mitovy hevitra amin'izany isika.
I know you're just a good friend.	Fantatro fa namana tsara fotsiny ianao.
You said he talked to you.	Nilaza ianao fa niresaka taminao izy.
He played with her.	Nilalao taminy izy.
So you don’t have to worry about me.	Ka tsy mila manahy momba ahy ianao.
And that seems to be true.	Ary toa marina tokoa izany.
I don't know the child.	Tsy fantatro ilay zaza.
He was unconscious.	Tsy nahatsiaro tena izy.

Safe new car.	Fiara vaovao azo antoka.
It’s a pretty little thing.	Zavatra kely tsara tarehy izany.
I don't have much money.	Tsy manana vola be aho.
He couldn't think of that now.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra an’izany izy izao.
She told me she liked the questions and it was really fun.	Nilaza tamiko izy fa tiany ireo fanontaniana ary tena nahafinaritra.
Yes, there it is.	Eny, eo izany.
First together, and then together.	Ny voalohany dia niaraka, ary avy eo niaraka.
And they were afraid of him too.	Ary natahotra azy koa izy ireo.
I need the job.	Mila ny asa aho.
They lost everything.	Very ny zava-drehetra izy ireo.
They played music in this room for hours.	Nilalao mozika tao amin’ity efitrano ity nandritra ny ora maro izy ireo.
I knew it.	Efa haiko.
He will be a good player.	Ho mpilalao mahay izy.
I am no different.	Tsy hafa aho.
Tonight there will be a big party.	Anio alina dia hisy fety lehibe.
He has already asked you.	Efa nangataka anao izy.
Night for hours.	Alina mandritra ny ora maro.
I enjoyed it from start to finish.	Nahafinaritra ahy hatramin'ny voalohany ka hatramin'ny farany.
Where are you from	Avy aiza ianao?
That's how it should be.	Izany no tokony ho izy.
Then you will get it.	Dia ho azonao izany.
Maybe worse than that.	Angamba ratsy noho izany.
You are as smart as you can imagine.	Mahay toy ny hevitra azonao ianao.
It really helps.	Tena manampy tokoa izany.
Then again, they may not be.	Avy eo indray, mety tsy izy ireo.
Usually the first two.	Matetika ny roa voalohany.
There is no guarantee of this.	Tsy misy azo antoka izany.
This is a big problem.	Olana lehibe izany.
I think it won’t be long.	Heveriko fa tsy ho ela izany.
I still find that to be true.	Mbola hitako fa marina izany.
He decided.	Nanapa-kevitra izy.
Then he left.	Dia lasa izy.
Two men were with him in the car.	Lehilahy roa no niaraka taminy tao anaty fiara.
It seems completely wrong.	Toa diso lalana mihitsy izany.
I've been there before.	Efa tany aho taloha.
I don’t know what happened to me.	Tsy fantatro izay nitranga tamiko.
They seem confused.	Toa very hevitra izy ireo.
You are very good.	Tena tsara tokoa ianao.
You will be able to walk.	Ho afaka handeha ianao.
This one is better than the others.	Ity dia tsara kokoa noho ny hafa.
And he thought so.	Dia nieritreritra izany izy.
He wants to live.	Te ho velona izy.
You have to know me.	Tsy maintsy mahafantatra ahy ianao.
Not us.	Tsy izahay.
He had trouble sleeping.	Sahirana natory izy.
No one saw him, but he saw no one.	Tsy nisy nahita azy, fa tsy nahita na iza na iza izy.
Maybe he's here.	Angamba izy eto.
But he did not know why.	Saingy tsy fantany ny antony.
He was expecting one.	Nanantena iray izy.
But there is no help.	Saingy tsy misy fanampiana.
And here it is.	Ary izao no izy.
It doesn’t have to be a good way to do it.	Tsy voatery ho fomba tsara hanaovana izany.
Because, yes, that’s not right.	Satria, eny, tsy mety izany.
I don't think it's too bad.	Heveriko fa tsy ratsy loatra ilay izy.
The big one and the small one.	Ny iray lehibe sy ny kely.
I quit.	Hiala aho.
We probably talked about three hours during the first few weeks.	Azo inoana fa niresaka momba ny adiny telo izahay nandritra ny herinandro vitsivitsy voalohany.
He had never seen anything like it before.	Mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izany izy taloha.
Not a bad idea.	Tsy hevitra ratsy.
There may be news there.	Mety hisy vaovao any.
Then we do it again.	Dia manao izany indray isika.
It is almost done.	Efa akaiky ho vita izany.
They come naturally, that’s why.	Tonga ho azy izy ireo, izany no antony.
But he didn't even know who he was.	Saingy tsy fantany akory hoe iza izy.
Not much time.	Tsy dia be ny fotoana.
Everything is fine.	Tsara ny zava-drehetra.
This baby is beautiful.	Tsara tarehy io zaza io.
He asked her if anything was wrong.	Nanontany azy izy raha nisy zavatra tsy nety.
They needed help.	Nila fanampiana izy ireo.
And still.	Ary mbola.
You are sick.	Marary ianao.
I'm not scared in the slightest.	Tsy matahotra na dia kely akory aza aho.
It doesn’t bring anything.	Tsy mitondra na inona na inona izany.
He didn’t have to wonder.	Tsy voatery nanontany tena izy.
Maybe it’s a bit too far.	Somary lasa lavitra angamba izany.
They haven't come here yet.	Mbola tsy tonga teto izy ireo.
It is possible.	Azo atao.
We need a new way.	Mila fomba vaovao isika.
For a long time, this was not known to many people.	Nandritra ny fotoana ela dia tsy dia fantatry ny olona maro izany.
Everyone already knows.	Efa fantatry ny rehetra izao.
Whether it is there or not.	Na eo io na tsy eo.
I don't want to talk.	Tsy te hiresaka aho.
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
But now, he has decided this is not the time.	Saingy izao, nanapa-kevitra izy fa tsy izao no fotoana.
Yes, kind of though.	Eny, karazana na izany aza.
So is everyone else.	Toy izany koa ny rehetra.
I found a letter.	Nahita taratasy aho.
No time is lost.	Tsy misy fotoana very.
A lot more than that.	Be dia be noho izany.
That's all he can do.	Izany ihany no azony atao.
This is as true as it was many years ago.	Marina toy ny tamin’ny taona maro lasa izany.
Or talk about it.	Na miresaka momba izany.
And good for them.	Ary tsara ho azy ireo.
I'm sure it's not.	Azoko antoka fa tsy izany.
It may seem helpful.	Mety toa manampy izany.
I thought he was going to.	Nihevitra aho fa handeha izy.
But it doesn’t really follow that.	Saingy tsy tena manaraka izany.
If you can, never say that.	Raha azonao atao dia aza milaza izany mihitsy.
The worst of the worst.	Ny ratsy indrindra amin'ny ratsy indrindra.
A rather unpleasant person.	Olona somary tsy mahafinaritra.
I did not talk to him.	Tsy niresaka taminy aho.
We have to go.	Tokony handeha isika.
It’s worse than the last, far worse.	Ratsy kokoa noho ny farany izany, ratsy lavitra.
No, it must be something else.	Tsia, tsy maintsy zavatra hafa izany.
I'm not sure about that.	Tsy azoko antoka ny momba izany.
However, not everyone is like that.	Na izany aza, tsy ny rehetra no toy izany.
That’s why we’re here.	Izany no nahatonga anay eto.
I should never have told you that.	Tsy tokony ho nilaza izany taminao mihitsy aho.
And he wrote to me every day.	Ary nanoratra tamiko isan'andro izy.
There were accidents every day.	Nisy loza isan’andro.
I buy new for the time being.	Mividy vaovao ho an'ny fotoana aho.
There was a day like this.	Nisy andro tahaka izao.
I know that, now.	Fantatro izany, ankehitriny.
We can do whatever you want.	Afaka manao izay tianao izahay.
For a few weeks.	Nandritra ny herinandro vitsivitsy.
And he knew he was lucky.	Ary fantany fa tsara vintana izy.
I have a hard time sleeping.	Sarotra amiko ny matory.
For the police, that is.	Ho an'ny polisy, izany hoe.
He has to go right away.	Tsy maintsy mandeha avy hatrany izy.
Even a little.	Na kely aza.
Very little.	Tena kely.
He is used to working hard.	Efa zatra miasa mafy izy.
He had already told me no.	Efa nilaza tamiko izy hoe tsia.
He is on the water.	Any ambony rano izy.
That’s the real idea.	Izany no tena hevitra.
I am angry.	Tezitra aho.
There was none.	Tsy nisy izany.
In fact, someone gets it.	Raha ny marina, misy olona mahazo izany.
But we are still trying to read it.	Saingy mbola miezaka mamaky azy io izahay.
He needed me.	Nila ahy izy.
Things could be even better.	Mety ho tsara kokoa aza ny zavatra.
We should have seen him.	Tokony ho nahita azy isika.
I'm not sure if that's possible.	Tsy azoko antoka raha azo atao izany.
Music.	Mozika.
These are not like pictures.	Tsy toy ny sary ireo.
They are often malnourished.	Matetika izy ireo no tsy ampy sakafo.
Of course, something had to happen.	Mazava ho azy fa nisy zavatra tsy maintsy nitranga.
Which is really good.	Izay tena tsara.
No one is doing anything.	Tsy misy manao na inona na inona.
Of course, of course.	Mazava ho azy, mazava ho azy.
It was bad luck.	Vintana ratsy izany.
But it was so much fun.	Fa nahafinaritra be.
He didn't want her to go.	Tsy tiany handeha izy.
No, he could not speak now.	Tsia, tsy afaka niteny izy izao.
But if not, you are right.	Fa raha tsy izany dia marina ianao.
It never told me that.	Tsy nilaza tamiko mihitsy izany.
This is not a good idea.	Tsy hevitra tsara izany.
I looked at him.	Nijery azy aho.
It’s not a few days.	Tsy andro vitsivitsy izany.
Thought how to do it right.	Nieritreritra ny fomba hanaovana izany tsara.
But I don’t need it anymore.	Fa tsy mila izany intsony.
I want to see him.	Te hahita azy aho.
What is your problem? 	Inona no olana aminao?
He said it would be around two in the afternoon.	Nilaza izy fa ho any amin'ny roa tolakandro.
No one does that anymore.	Tsy misy manao izany intsony.
He thought so.	Nihevitra izany izy.
You have done this from the beginning.	Efa hatramin'ny voalohany ianao no nanao izany.
This may not be true for you.	Mety tsy marina aminao izany.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Toa nahafinaritra azy izany.
There was a lot of fun.	Be dia be ny nahafinaritra.
It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona izany.
When you arrive.	Rehefa tonga ianao.
I still don’t.	Mbola tsy manao aho.
He didn't even know what he was doing.	Tsy fantany akory izay nataony.
Then he went back to the front again.	Dia niverina teo aloha indray izy.
Now he knows better.	Ankehitriny dia mahafantatra tsara kokoa izy.
I never thought of that again.	Tsy mbola nieritreritra an'izany intsony aho.
Mine and yours.	Ny ahy sy ny anao.
He is there.	Ao izy.
He is very tall.	Lava tokoa izy.
You will not be beautiful.	Tsy ho tsara tarehy ianao.
They seem to do everything the right way.	Toa manao ny zava-drehetra amin'ny fomba mety izy ireo.
They started talking.	Nanomboka niresaka izy ireo.
They go all the time.	Mandeha amin'ny fotoana rehetra izy ireo.
Finally, he did.	Farany, nanao izany izy.
It has been there since day one.	Efa tany hatramin'ny andro voalohany.
He went further.	Lasa lavitra kokoa izy.
That’s right, he has an idea.	Tena marina izany, manana hevitra izy.
Then the woman had no problem for even a minute.	Avy eo dia tsy nanana olana na dia iray minitra aza ilay vehivavy.
I haven't been there yet.	Mbola tsy tonga tany.
I fell asleep reading a story.	Renoky ny torimaso namaky tantara iray aho.
The people are so beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy ny olona.
They will talk about it too.	Hiresaka momba izany koa izy ireo.
You are here.	Eto ianao.
I thought he was going to be great.	Nihevitra aho fa ho lehibe izy.
Or maybe just me.	Na angamba izaho ihany.
He had seen it himself.	Efa nijery izany ny tenany.
I remember it well.	Tadidiko tsara ilay izy.
They may need it.	Mety mila izany izy ireo.
Have you been to this room before?	Efa tonga tao amin'ity efitrano ity ve ianao taloha?
And it really may or may not.	Ary tena mety ho izany na tsia.
It's easier.	Mora kokoa izany.
I’ve been thinking about that moment for a long time.	Efa ela aho no nieritreritra an'io fotoana io.
But they are.	Fa izy ireo .
And it could be anything.	Ary mety ho na inona na inona.
I had never seen them before.	Tsy mbola nahita azy ireo aho taloha.
It often rains in the summer.	Matetika ny orana rehefa fahavaratra.
It’s more fun.	Mahafinaritra kokoa izany.
But even then, nothing happened.	Saingy na izany aza dia tsy nisy zava-nitranga.
We want to help you.	Te hanampy anao izahay.
They all learned.	Samy nianatra izy rehetra.
I didn’t ask for it.	Tsy nangataka izany aho.
I’m not sure, really.	Tsy azoko antoka, tena.
And then that.	Ary avy eo izany.
That’s what he likes.	Izany no tiany.
I like to do something special.	Tiako ny manao zavatra manokana.
There were other words as well.	Nisy teny hafa koa.
It is not known what mistake I made here.	Tsy fantatra ny fahadisoana nataoko teto.
I want the best for everyone ’.	Tiako ny tsara indrindra ho an'ny rehetra'.
This book is one of them.	Iray amin'izany ity boky ity.
The ground was full of little papers.	Feno taratasy kely ny tany.
But you’ll be surprised how quickly it takes three hours.	Fa ho gaga ianao fa haingana dia feno adiny telo.
Dinner last night and tonight from one.	Sakafo omaly hariva ary anio alina avy amin'ny iray.
You and you alone.	Ianao ary ianao irery ihany.
That's what it's all about.	Izany no azo.
There is an end to it.	Misy farany izany.
They are all dead now.	Maty daholo izao.
I really know that.	Tena fantatro izany.
And it didn’t happen.	Ary tsy nitranga izany.
Who knows you are with us.	Iza no mahalala fa miaraka aminay ianao.
Lots of water nearby.	Rano be dia be akaiky.
They spoke again.	Niteny indray izy ireo.
i just work.	miasa fotsiny aho.
Whatever to do.	Na inona na inona hatao.
We love too much.	Tia be loatra isika.
And then the other room is music.	Ary avy eo ny efitrano hafa dia mozika.
He asked you.	Nangataka anao izy.
It was fun too.	Nahafinaritra ihany koa izany.
Or maybe.	Na angamba.
Days, sure, weeks maybe.	Andro, azo antoka, herinandro angamba.
It’s been a good year.	Efa taona tsara izany.
They really want to do it.	Tena te hanao izany izy ireo.
So we went and got there.	Dia nandeha izahay ary tonga teo.
To name a few.	Raha te hilaza vitsivitsy.
Everyone seemed happy.	Toa faly ny rehetra.
They worked long hours.	Niasa nandritra ny ora maro izy ireo.
There is still much to do.	Mbola betsaka ny hatao.
But he could.	Saingy mety izy.
There may be two reasons.	Mety misy antony roa.
We think so.	Mihevitra izany izahay.
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
Right now he is busy.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia sahirana izy.
He is then free.	Afaka izy avy eo.
Of course, they are good.	Mazava ho azy fa mahay izy ireo.
I love working.	Tiako ny miasa.
I had never seen this before.	Mbola tsy nahita izany aho taloha.
He came here, but not for long.	Tonga eto izy, saingy tsy ela.
I love these things.	Tiako ireo zavatra ireo.
You still have them.	Mbola manana azy ireo ianao.
But what happened, has happened.	Fa izay nitranga, efa nitranga.
So he should do it.	Ka tokony hanao izany izy.
I know you expect news from us.	Fantatro fa manantena vaovao avy aminay ianao.
I couldn't do anything wrong.	Tsy afaka nanao ratsy aho.
They just had fun.	Vao avy nahafinaritra izy ireo.
I really like the picture.	Tiako be ilay sary.
It's just wrong.	Diso fotsiny izany.
There are people here.	Misy olona eto.
Absolute money.	Vola tanteraka.
Maybe that’s the problem.	Angamba izany no olana.
It's almost there.	Efa ho izy.
Even now.	Na amin'izao fotoana izao.
I thought they would go.	Nihevitra aho fa handeha izy ireo.
He did it too often.	Nanao izany matetika loatra izy.
Not afraid to be real.	Tsy matahotra ny ho tena.
This is not the case.	Tsy izany no izy.
No questions remain.	Tsy misy fanontaniana mipetraka.
I don't see that he is happy.	Tsy hitako fa faly izy.
Do you think you can eat like this ?.	Heverinao ve fa afaka mihinana tahaka izao ianao?.
I know what happened, and so do you.	Fantatro ny zava-nitranga, ary ianao koa.
I've seen it.	Efa hitako izany.
It was a fun movie.	Sarimihetsika nahafinaritra ilay izy.
I don't know.	Tsy fantatro.
It’s easy to do it without anyone knowing.	Mora ny manao izany tsy misy mahafantatra.
Yes, it is a long story.	Eny, tantara lava izany.
I will not do that.	Tsy hanao izany aho.
He was not home yet.	Mbola tsy tao an-trano izy.
It could be very different.	Mety ho hafa mihitsy izany.
That's enough.	Ampy izay.
The question is what can be done.	Ny fanontaniana dia hoe inona no azo atao.
I told him no.	Nolazaiko azy hoe tsia.
So are you.	Toy izany koa ianao.
It is still in the works.	Mbola eo amin'ny asa izany.
Words are alive.	Velona ny teny.
It seems the same to me.	Toa mitovy ihany izany amiko.

He can do better than that.	Afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izany izy.

With him.	Miaraka aminy.

It seems clear that they have.	Toa mazava fa manana izy ireo.
It is for others.	Ho an'ny hafa izany.
Or maybe worse.	Na mety ho ratsy kokoa.
Don't even look for me.	Aza mitady ahy akory.

He didn't ask about me.	Tsy nanontany momba ahy.
We will surely win.	Azo antoka fa handresy isika.
I do not .	Tsy manao izany aho .
They decided to do it without rain.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hanao tsy misy orana izy ireo.
He was surprised.	Gaga izy.
Everything is who and where and how and why, why, why.	Ny zava-drehetra dia hoe iza ary aiza ary ahoana ary nahoana, nahoana, nahoana.
Many people wonder if it will rain.	Maro ny olona manontany tena raha ho avy ny orana.
I like that.	Tiako izany.
He is anxious to do good.	Manahy ny hanao zavatra tsara izy.
And someone did.	Ary nisy nanao izany.

They wanted to talk to me.	Te hiresaka tamiko izy ireo.
Hope you come back.	Manantena fa hiverina ianao.

It's a long way to go.	Lavitra ny dia.
Right now we’re always on the go.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia mandeha foana izahay.

Today is a great day.	Andro lehibe tokoa ny androany.
You know now.	Fantatrao izao.
I was so surprised.	Gaga loatra aho.

And it could be.	Ary mety ho izany.
If so, you may have.	Raha misy dia mety manana ianao.
He doesn’t care.	Tsy miraharaha izy.
The story here is similar.	Toy izany koa ny tantara teto.
The house was small and ugly.	Kely sy ratsy ny tao anaty trano.
That’s what made him one of my favorite people.	Izany no nahatonga azy ho iray amin'ireo olona tiako indrindra.
And there is no place at all.	Ary tsy misy toerana mihitsy.
It might help.	Mety hanampy izany.

You never know what might happen.	Tsy fantatrao mihitsy izay mety hitranga.

This can be done quickly.	Azo atao haingana izany.
It seems like a true story.	Toa tantara marina io.
But there is a problem.	Saingy misy olana.
Maybe there is an easier way.	Angamba misy fomba mora kokoa.
Because it’s too hard.	Satria mafy loatra.
How about you.	Ahoana ny hevitrao.
Yes, that’s a real word.	Eny, tena teny izany.
I totally understand.	azoko tanteraka.
Yes you have to keep going.	Eny tsy maintsy mandeha hatrany ianao.
Someone did the same to me.	Nisy nanao izany tamiko koa.
That shouldn’t happen.	Tsy tokony hitranga izany.
I waited a few hours and tried again.	Niandry ora vitsivitsy aho dia nanandrana indray.

And yes, we need good work.	Ary eny, mila asa tsara isika.
And in fact, he liked it.	Ary raha ny marina dia tiany izany.
I don’t care about anything.	Tsy miraharaha na inona na inona aho.
Yeah, yeah, that’s great.	Eny, eny, tena tsara izany.
We are neither good nor bad at all.	Tsy tsara na ratsy tanteraka isika.
He just wanted the man to go.	Tiany handeha fotsiny ilay lehilahy.
What it might be, he doesn’t know.	Mety ho inona izany, tsy fantany.

He was very scared.	Tena natahotra izy.
You have seen it.	Efa nahita azy ianao.
That is not now.	Izany hoe tsy izao.
Think of him a lot.	Mieritreritra azy be dia be.
So we did.	Dia nanao izany izahay.
But not to people.	Fa tsy amin'ny olona.
We are not the only ones who can do this.	Tsy isika irery no afaka manao izany.
I'm not too surprised.	Tsy dia gaga aho.
John is a good friend.	Namana tsara i John.
He knew it was bad.	Fantany fa ratsy izany.
The day started early in the morning.	Vao maraina be ny andro rehefa nanomboka.
These are the good old days.	Ireo no andro tsara taloha.
He stopped and came out.	Nijanona izy ary nivoaka.
They just don’t believe.	Tsy mino fotsiny izy ireo.
We will meet in the morning.	Hihaona isika ny maraina.
They enjoyed the fun.	Nahafinaritra azy ireo ny faly.
But he will return.	Fa hiverina izy.
Outwardly, things are a little different.	Any ivelany, hafa kely ny zavatra.
Maybe he was expecting something else.	Angamba nanantena zavatra hafa izy.
There has never been one.	Tsy mbola nisy izany na dia iray aza.
In fact, they are lucky.	Raha ny marina dia tsara vintana izy ireo.
There are men.	Ao ny lehilahy.
I don’t know if this thing is okay.	Tsy fantany raha mety io zavatra io.
I live here.	Mipetraka eto aho.
Close to the house.	Akaiky ny trano.
Three weeks, then.	Telo herinandro, avy eo.

There may have been.	Mety nisy.
Better place for money.	Toerana tsara kokoa ho an'ny vola.
Good, though.	Tsara, na izany aza.
Tell me why.	Lazao ahy ny antony.
Didn't say that today.	Tsy nilaza izany androany.
We are both teachers.	Samy mpampianatra izahay.
I was glad to see that.	Faly aho nahita izany.
None, in fact.	Tsy misy, raha ny marina.
That should have happened.	Tokony ho efa nitranga izany.
It just seems wrong.	Toa diso fotsiny izany.
This year is different.	Hafa ny amin’ity taona ity.
The problem is money.	Ny olana dia ny vola.
But special first.	Fa manokana aloha.
Another reason is because it is not necessary.	Ny antony iray hafa dia satria tsy ilaina izany.
We live here too.	Mipetraka eto koa izahay.
But more than that.	Fa mihoatra noho izany.
The news came out.	Nivoaka ny vaovao.
He is not an ordinary man.	Tsy lehilahy mandeha ho azy izy.
He wasn't too surprised.	Tsy dia gaga loatra izy.
He was confused.	Very hevitra izy.
It was as if they still had work to do.	Toy ny mbola nanana asa tokony hatao izy ireo.
No, they haven't seen him yet.	Tsia, mbola tsy nahita azy izy ireo.
He did not look at them.	Tsy nijery azy ireo izy.
I'm not talking.	Tsy miteny aho.
The end is coming soon.	Ho avy tsy ho ela ny farany.
Feel free to do so.	Aza misalasala manao izany.

I won't talk to you again.	Tsy hiresaka aminao intsony aho.
He doesn’t have and never will.	Tsy manana ary tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Tsy te hiresaka amiko izy.
Yes, you know it’s not too bad.	Eny, fantatrao fa tsy dia ratsy loatra izany.
Then they moved to the new house.	Avy eo izy ireo dia nandeha nankany amin'ny trano vaovao.
I don't eat that.	Tsy mihinana an’izany aho.
Angry with me.	Tezitra amiko.
Lots of people.	Betsaka ny olona.
Both are true.	Samy marina ireo.
Very good, very good.	Tena tsara, tena tsara.
We need to talk about them.	Mila miresaka momba azy ireo isika.
So, reason is at home for no reason as no reason.	Noho izany, ny antony dia ao an-trano amin'ny tsy antony toy ny tsy antony.
No one had made the trip before.	Tsy nisy nanao ilay dia teo aloha.
I'm sure he's with you.	Azoko antoka fa miaraka aminao izy.
The next thing you know they want to buy a car for them.	Ny zavatra manaraka fantatrao dia te hividy fiara ho azy ireo izy ireo.
Maybe they follow us.	Angamba izy ireo manaraka antsika.
In the end, he did nothing.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona izy tamin’ny farany.
I'm glad he's gone.	Faly aho fa lasa izy.
This is the only thing that can be done.	Io ihany no azo atao.

They never returned.	Tsy niverina tany intsony izy ireo.
The same goes for the latest news.	Toy izany koa ny vaovao farany.
Definitely better than before.	Azo antoka fa tsara kokoa noho ny teo aloha.
We never saw him, but we heard him.	Tsy nahita azy mihitsy izahay, fa nandre azy.
The future is still uncertain.	Mbola tsy azo antoka ny ho avy.
I did the right thing.	Nanao ny tsara aho.
He wants everything to be fun.	Tiany ho mahafinaritra ny zava-drehetra.
I don’t like people giving things away.	Tsy tia olona nanome zavatra.
We started the journey.	Nanomboka ny dia izahay.
And it’s not good either.	Ary tsy tsara koa.
It will be so.	Ho toy izany.
I really disagree with him.	Tena tsy mitovy hevitra aminy mihitsy aho.
He wasn't sure why he came.	Tsy azony antoka hoe nahoana izy no tonga.
It was hard to talk to him.	Sarotra ny niresaka taminy.
It's too late again.	Tara loatra indray.
So don’t worry first.	Koa aza manahy aloha.
It's not just his.	Tsy azy ihany ilay izy.
The same is true of women.	Toy izany koa ny vehivavy.
It happened to me.	Nitranga tamiko izany.
They said nothing.	Tsy niteny na inona na inona izy ireo.
This letter.	Ity taratasy ity.
If you want.	Raha tianao.
They were afraid of being late.	Natahotra ny ho tara izy ireo.
.	.
This tragedy is a tragedy.	Loza io loza io.
Maybe not.	Angamba mety tsy izany.
No one needed it.	Tsy nisy nila izany.
Are you ready to go?	Vonona ny handeha ve ianao?
The food was delicious.	Nahafinaritra ny sakafo.
Please tell me the truth.	Mba lazao ahy ny marina.
I don’t want to say anything like that.	Tsy te hilaza zavatra toy izany aho.
I had to do the right thing.	Tsy maintsy nanao ny tsara aho.
I enjoyed it and took some great pictures with it as well.	Nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy ary nanao sary mahafinaritra niaraka taminy koa.
They should know.	Tokony ho fantany.
But he is not the man now.	Saingy tsy izy ilay lehilahy amin'izao fotoana izao.
This goes two ways.	Izany dia mandeha amin'ny lalana roa.

It’s fun.	Mahafinaritra izany.
I want you to be better than me.	Tiako ho tsara noho izaho ianao.
And do things.	Ary manao zavatra.
And then he came back to me again.	Ary avy eo dia niverina tamiko indray izy.

Like the first.	Toy ny voalohany.
Someone had to do it.	Nisy olona tsy maintsy nanao izany.
he wondered.	nanontany tena izy.

I don't remember the day anymore.	Tsy tadidiko intsony ilay andro.
I'm glad we met you.	Faly aho fa nihaona taminao izahay.

You work hard for others.	Miasa mafy ho an'ny hafa ianao.
And so are we.	Ary toy izany koa izahay.
They are me.	Izaho izy ireo.
You can, but I can't.	Azonao atao, fa tsy izaho.
It’s so easy.	Tena mora izany.
They couldn’t decide what to do with you.	Tsy afaka nanapa-kevitra izay hatao aminao izy ireo.
I just want to be sure.	Te hahazo antoka fotsiny aho.
They seem to be waiting for something.	Toa miandry zavatra izy ireo.

Maybe the letter is for me.	Angamba ho ahy ilay taratasy.
For every bad word, you have to say a good one.	Ho an'ny teny ratsy rehetra dia tsy maintsy miteny iray tsara ianao.

That was clear from the beginning.	Efa mazava hatramin’ny voalohany izany.
It just has to be for you.	Tsy maintsy ho anao fotsiny izany.
One last question.	Fanontaniana iray farany.

There are people like that.	Misy olona toy izany.
But for good reason.	Saingy noho ny antony tsara izany.
I think we need to talk about that.	Heveriko fa mila miresaka momba izany isika.

Fast and hard.	Haingana sy mafy.
We hope nothing else.	Manantena izahay fa tsy misy hafa koa.
I saw this picture this morning.	Hitako io sary io androany maraina.

I haven't called him yet.	Mbola tsy niantso azy aho.
Couldn't leave.	Tsy afaka niala.

He looked at one book, then another.	Nijery boky iray izy, avy eo boky hafa.
I didn’t see him anywhere.	Tsy hitako na taiza na taiza izy.
No.	No.
The car	Ny fiara
You just have to look and watch.	Mila mijery sy mijery fotsiny ianao.
This question.	Izao fanontaniana izao.
The same is true of all work.	Toy izany koa ny asa rehetra.
We made the trip.	Nanao ny dia izahay.
But he hath wronged me.	Fa nanao ratsy tamiko izy.
He must have longed for her.	Tsy maintsy ho naniry mafy azy izy.
Finally, I finally got it.	Farany, azoko ihany.
Of course, no one will do that.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy misy olona hanao izany.
And for now, that doesn’t matter.	Ary amin'izao fotoana izao dia tsy maninona izany.
We will go.	Handeha izahay.
I haven't had a dog yet.	Mbola tsy nanana alika aho.
We need some time.	Mila fotoana kely isika.
This car is very good.	Tena tsara ity fiara ity.
There is.	Misy .
I knew he would.	Fantatro fa hanao izany izy.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Na izany aza, toa tsy izany no izy.
He could have said it easily.	Afaka niteny izany mora foana izy.
Maybe soon.	Angamba tsy ho ela.
You are not wrong.	Tsy diso ianao.
He doesn’t hesitate, he doesn’t hesitate.	Tsy misalasala izy, tsy misalasala.
Sounds fun.	Toa mahafinaritra.
I don’t remember much of that.	Tsy tadidiko loatra izany.
Yes to all that.	Eny amin'izany rehetra izany.
I'm looking at this.	Mijery ity aho.
We had to talk about something fun.	Tsy maintsy niresaka zavatra mahafinaritra izahay.
Don't do anything else.	Aza manao zavatra hafa.
There seemed to be no reason for that.	Toa tsy nisy antony izany.
It should happen immediately.	Tokony hitranga avy hatrany izany.
It all seems so.	Toa izany ny rehetra.
I don't want you to go.	Tsy tiako handeha ianao.
But it's okay now.	Fa tsy maninona izao.
It should be everywhere.	Tokony ho eny rehetra eny.
And he doesn't know anything now.	Ary tsy mahalala na inona na inona izy ankehitriny.
Tonight is one of those nights.	Anio alina dia iray amin'ireo alina ireo.
He really liked it.	Tena tiany tokoa izany.
Those days are gone for me.	Lasa ho ahy ireo andro ireo.
He works harder than anyone who works for him.	Miasa mafy kokoa noho izay rehetra miasa ho azy izy.
Many years ago now.	Taona maro lasa izay izao.
He asked her why she had left.	Nanontany azy izy hoe nahoana izy no lasa.
They are very skilled.	Tena mahay izy ireo.
I haven't been there yet.	Mbola tsy tany aho.
And that is exactly the problem.	Ary izany indrindra no olana.
I hope someone can help me.	Manantena aho fa misy afaka manampy ahy.
Why is not clear.	Nahoana no tsy mazava.
She is good.	Tsara izy.
I know the right man.	Fantatro ilay lehilahy marina.
Where's the little fool.	Aiza ilay kely adala .
I know it's okay.	Fantatro fa mety izany.
To be happy.	Mba ho faly.
I'm glad to have it.	Faly aho manana azy.
I need to make them smaller.	Mila ataoko kely kokoa izy ireo.
I met him last night.	Nihaona taminy aho omaly alina.
He died trying.	Maty nanandrana izy.
He will leave when he is ready !.	Handeha izy rehefa vonona!.
He wanted too much.	Naniry be loatra izy.
He did it everywhere.	Nataony eny rehetra eny izany.
Then, play only when needed.	Avy eo, milalao fotsiny rehefa ilaina izany.
He didn’t like to go alone.	Tsy tiany ny nandeha irery.
It was really good.	Tena tsara ilay izy.
The players are fun.	Mahafinaritra ny mpilalao.
They’re good, but too fast.	Tsara izy ireo, fa haingana dia haingana.
No more than a few years.	Tsy mihoatra ny taona vitsivitsy.
She plans to study abroad.	Mikasa ny hianatra any ivelany izy.
We do this for a few reasons.	Manao izany izahay noho ny antony vitsivitsy.
No need for money.	Tsy mila vola.
He looks at me.	Mijery ahy izy.
I don't see the problem.	Tsy hitako ny olana.
They wouldn’t know it, if they didn’t know it.	Tsy ho fantany izany, raha tsy fantany izany.
No more than two hours passed.	Tsy mihoatra ny adiny roa no lasa.
Beautiful woman like you.	Vehivavy tsara tarehy toa anao.
He never called again.	Tsy niantso intsony izy.
Time passed.	Nandeha ny fotoana.
He believes in the last days.	Mino ny andro farany izy.
It’s not easy.	Tsy mora izy.
Which suits me.	Izay mety amiko.
He shouldn’t have done that either.	Tsy tokony ho nanao izany koa.
Don't let anyone tell you anything else.	Aza avela hisy hilaza hafa aminao.
I have a big problem.	Manana olana lehibe aho.
There was something to be done.	Nisy zavatra tokony hatao.
That’s why they’re with you.	Izany no nahatonga azy ireo niaraka taminao.
He didn't say much during dinner.	Tsy dia niteny firy izy nandritra ny sakafo hariva.
He had never seen the woman before.	Mbola tsy nahita an’io vehivavy io mihitsy izy.
Then an idea came to him.	Nisy hevitra tonga taminy avy eo.
You heard me.	Nandre ahy ianao.
What an idea.	Toy ny inona ny hevitra.
I don’t believe in all that.	Tsy mino an'izany rehetra izany aho.
But no one does everything.	Saingy tsy misy olona manao ny zava-drehetra.
Of course, this did not really happen.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy tena nisy izany.
This is highly unlikely.	Tsy azo inoana loatra izany.
Last week for it.	Herinandro farany ho azy io.
He had no friends.	Tsy nanana namana izy.
Do it for us this week friends.	Manao izany ho antsika amin'ity herinandro ity ry namana.
However, they came.	Na izany aza dia tonga izy ireo.
Yes, it is not possible and it may not matter.	Eny, tsy azo atao izany ary mety tsy maninona izany.
Just say so.	Lazao fotsiny hoe toy izany.
I couldn’t drive with something like that.	Tsy afaka nitondra fiara tamin'ny zavatra toy izany aho.
That's it.	Izay izany.
It was a wonderful night.	Tena alina nahafinaritra tokoa ilay izy.
It just doesn’t go far.	Tsy lasa lavitra fotsiny izany.
There must be something that made them look at me.	Azo antoka fa nisy zavatra nahatonga azy ireo hijery ahy.
Not much.	Tsy betsaka.
Certainly not.	Azo antoka fa tsy izany no izy.
No time was lost.	Tsy nisy fotoana very.
I think this is the future.	Heveriko fa ity no ho avy.
They will help us well for many years to come.	Hanampy antsika tsara izy ireo mandritra ny taona maro ho avy.
However, months ago.	Na izany aza, volana lasa izay.
I'm still yours.	Mbola anao aho.
He looked at them himself.	Nijery azy ireo ny tenany.
He failed to do so.	Tsy nahavita izany izy.
I didn't.	tsy nanao aho.
I didn’t start, he didn’t start.	Tsy izaho no nanomboka, izy tsy nanomboka.
The road is long for me.	Lavitra ny lalana ho ahy.
Whether you have it or not.	Na manana ianao na tsy manana.
He immediately called the police.	Niantso polisy avy hatrany izy.
I really hope he does well.	Tena manantena aho fa hanao tsara izy.
You never love me.	Tsy tia ahy mihitsy ianao.
I’m not going to a party this year.	Tsy handeha amin'ny fety aho amin'ity taona ity.
Two years ago.	Roa taona lasa izay.
And maybe even more.	Ary mety mbola betsaka kokoa.
He returned immediately.	Niverina avy hatrany izy.
Finally, the man died.	Farany dia maty ilay lehilahy.
None of them worked.	Tsy nisy niasa izy ireo.
And no one has been able to help its kind.	Ary tsy mbola nisy afaka nanampy ny karazana azy.
Not that month.	Tsy io volana io.
I thought it went well.	Nihevitra aho fa nandeha tsara.
Whatever happens will happen here.	Na inona na inona hitranga dia hitranga eto.
It’s not that we don’t care about the past.	Tsy hoe tsy miraharaha ny lasa akory.
But two and two doesn’t necessarily get you right.	Saingy ny roa sy ny roa dia tsy voatery hahazo anao ny marina.
Lost car.	Very fiara.
I saw that he was at home.	Hitako fa tao an-trano izy.
He tried it that morning.	Nanandrana izy io maraina io.
I don’t know what words for something like that.	Tsy haiko izay teny ho an'ny zavatra toy izany.
A lot of people like me are lost.	Betsaka ny olona toa ahy very.
These books are not yours.	Tsy anao ireo boky ireo.
I think we have a great opportunity here.	Heveriko fa manana fahafahana lehibe isika eto.
And there was none.	Ary tsy nisy.
But of course this is not true.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy marina izany.
And there are a lot of them.	Ary be dia be izy ireo.
I did something else.	Nanao zavatra hafa aho.
He did a lot.	Nanao be dia be izy.
And he knows mine.	Ary fantany ny ahy.
That’s a big thing.	Zavatra lehibe izany.
Don't worry, we are waiting for you.	Aza manahy fa miandry anao izahay.
Go swimming.	Mandeha milomano.
He often has to stay home.	Matetika izy no tsy maintsy mijanona ao an-trano.
He felt crazy.	Nahatsiaro ho adala izy.
It seems like nothing is real.	Toy ny tsy misy ny tena izy.
This has never happened before.	Tsy mbola nisy izany indray mandeha.
In the past, they did.	Taloha dia nanao izany izy ireo.
You have come to a new place.	Tonga tany amin'ny toerana vaovao ianao.
Things will be fine.	Ho tsara ny zavatra.
I enjoyed doing it.	Nahafinaritra ahy ny nanao izany.
Yes, thank you.	Eny, misaotra .
will not happen in the end.	tsy hitranga amin'ny farany.
But the man is good.	Fa tsara ilay lehilahy.
Everything goes on time.	Ny zava-drehetra dia mandeha amin'ny fotoana.
He did not sleep.	Tsy natory izy.
I don't like it.	Tsy tiako ilay izy.
He wanted me to stay.	Tiany hijanona aho.
If you’re not sure, don’t do it.	Raha tsy azonao antoka dia aza manao izany.
I might be wrong about that.	Mety ho diso hevitra aho amin'izany.
Don't play with him.	Aza milalao aminy.
I think that might be the reason.	Heveriko fa mety ho izany no antony.
If you love to swim, swim.	Raha tia milomano ianao dia milomano.
You don’t care about these people.	Tsy miraharaha ireo olona ireo ianao.
It was a good day.	Andro tsara izany.
We didn’t have anything like that.	Tsy nanana zavatra toy izany izahay.
This is very clear.	Mazava be izany.
That’s a good idea if you like it.	Hevitra tsara izany raha tianao ilay izy.
I've been here.	Efa teto aho.
I need to know something.	Mila mahafantatra zavatra aho.
I saw a good movie a few weeks ago.	Nahita sarimihetsika tsara aho herinandro vitsivitsy lasa izay.
And it doesn’t happen automatically.	Ary tsy mandeha ho azy izany.
Now, he’s a completely different player to me.	Ankehitriny, mpilalao hafa tanteraka amiko izy.
Not many words today.	Tsy misy teny betsaka androany.
But that's enough.	Fa ampy izay.
I'm leaving.	miala amiko aho.
This is a mistake that will never happen again.	Fahadisoana tsy hitranga intsony izany.
I think we did.	Heveriko fa nanao izany isika.
Unconscious.	Tsy nahatsiaro tena.
He was the first to win.	Izy no nahazo voalohany.
One of the many he loved.	Iray amin'ireo maro no tia azy.
Maybe we should go.	Tokony handeha angamba isika.
Yes, it seems to have happened.	Eny, toa nisy izany.
Not good, but great.	Tsy tsara, fa lehibe.
This is very small.	Kely tokoa ity.
There is only one.	Iray ihany no misy.
But he could not do it himself.	Saingy tsy afaka nanao izany ny tenany.
They just go and do what they want.	Mandeha fotsiny izy ireo ary manao izay tiany.
That’s a lot here.	Betsaka izany eto.
The former will not do so.	Tsy hanao izany ny teo aloha.
I had no chance of seeing anything there.	Tsy nanana vintana aho nahita na inona na inona tao.
He was often able to do so.	Matetika izy no afaka nanao izany.
No one cares about me.	Tsy misy miraharaha ahy.
We must assume he saw them.	Tsy maintsy mihevitra isika fa nahita azy ireo izy.
Not me first.	Tsy izaho aloha.
However, of course they did not.	Na izany aza, mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao izany izy ireo.
However, it is not.	Na izany aza, tsy izany.
I had never done anything so great before.	Mbola tsy nanao zavatra lehibe toy izany aho taloha.
Or maybe they already asked the dog.	Na angamba efa nanontany ilay alika izy ireo.
And he did.	Ary fantany tokoa.
You have been very helpful.	Tena nanampy be ianao.
They are too big.	Lehibe loatra izy ireo.
Whatever it is.	Na inona na inona izany.
I think that’s crazy.	Heveriko fa adala izany.
But no, that's not it.	Saingy tsia, tsy izany tokoa.
This is faster and easier.	Izany dia haingana sy mora kokoa.
He refused to talk to us.	Tsy nety niresaka taminay izy.
I hope you like them.	Manantena aho fa tianao izy ireo.
Then the idea came back.	Dia niverina ny hevitra.
Ignore what you think.	Aza miraharaha izay hevitrao.
I don’t know why, right.	Tsy fantatro ny antony, marina.
There was nothing else that could be done.	Tsy nisy azo atao hafa.
I doubt that would be a good thing.	Misalasala aho fa mety ho zavatra tsara izany.
We thought you might want to see them again.	Nihevitra izahay fa mety te hahita azy ireo indray ianao.
I don’t know why he is rude.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana izy no tsy mahalala fomba.
Two more.	Roa hafa.
A minute later he was back.	Afaka iray minitra dia niverina izy.
He seems lost.	Toa very izy.
The first week went well.	Nandeha tsara ny herinandro voalohany.
Of course, he would not be upset.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy ho tezitra izy.
That's better.	Tsara kokoa izany.
Because he did.	Satria nanao izany izy.
Maybe, but soon.	Angamba, fa tsy ho ela.
None of these things are bad in any way.	Tsy misy amin'ireo zavatra ireo no ratsy amin'ny fomba rehetra.
Really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra.
We will get back to you again.	Mbola hiverina aminao indray izahay.
I really don’t understand why he spent so much.	Tena tsy azoko hoe nahoana izy no nandany be.
I should have told you at dinner.	Tokony ho nilaza taminao aho tamin'ny sakafo hariva.
Because we all have the information available.	Satria isika rehetra manana ny vaovao azo.
He must love them.	Tsy maintsy tia azy ireo izy.
It is already very clear.	Efa mazava tsara.
I’m not sure what he did.	Tsy fantatro tsara izay nataony.
It’s hard for him to leave in the evening.	Sarotra aminy ny miala amin'ny hariva.
I didn't say anything to him.	Tsy nilaza na inona na inona taminy aho.
And he heard it again.	Dia nandre izany indray izy.
Maybe that way is better.	Tsara kokoa angamba izany fomba izany.
Maybe he did at some point.	Angamba nanao izany izy tamin’ny fotoana iray.
It is one o'clock in the afternoon.	Amin’ny iray ora tolakandro izao.
So tell me.	Koa lazao amiko.
When he’s good, he’s really good.	Rehefa tsara izy dia tena tsara.
I don't know where he is.	Tsy fantatro hoe aiza izy.
This is another way.	Fomba iray hafa ity.
But not mine.	Fa tsy ny ahy.
The problem is that he is right.	Ny olana dia ny hoe marina izy.
Quick and easy to do.	Haingana sy mora atao.
Not too big.	Tsy lehibe loatra.
We don’t know anything about girls.	Tsy mahalala na inona na inona momba ny tovovavy izahay.
He should be back by now.	Tokony efa niverina izy izao.
Many children never learn.	Betsaka ny ankizy tsy mianatra mihitsy.
They sat talking.	Nipetraka niresaka izy ireo.
We talked to him about it.	Niresaka taminy momba izany izahay.
He is not a man for history.	Tsy lehilahy ho an'ny tantara izy.
I made new friends.	Nahazo namana vaovao aho.
Just a minute.	Iray minitra fotsiny.
Tena.	Tena.
What about this picture?	Ahoana ny amin'ity sary ity?
No one can do it for you.	Tsy misy afaka manao anao.
She is.	Dia dia.
This woman is someone else.	Olona hafa io vehivavy io.
He enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra azy izany.
Nothing is harder than that.	Tsy misy mafy kokoa noho izany.
I don't know why.	Tsy fantatro ny antony.
We didn’t have a place to do that either.	Tsy nanana toerana hanaovana izany koa izahay.
He is there and everywhere at once.	Eo izy ary na aiza na aiza indray mandeha.
Anything and then everything again.	Na inona na inona ary avy eo indray ny zava-drehetra.
This is very new to me.	Tena vaovao amiko izany.
Such a great man.	Lehilahy lehibe toy izany.
He’s really strong, but time will tell if he’s really good.	Tena mahery tokoa izy, saingy ny fotoana no hilaza raha tena tsara izy.
He wants to come back.	Te hiverina izy.
We went out and saw him.	Nivoaka izahay ka nahita azy.
We have to go tonight.	Tsy maintsy mandeha isika anio alina.
The first day was fast, but not fast enough.	Ny andro voalohany dia haingana, fa tsy ampy haingana.

There are fools.	Misy adala.

The past year has been a long way off.	Ny taona lasa dia tena lavitra be.
He made it work.	Nataony niasa izany.
I really understand you.	Tena azoko tsara ianao.
This idea seems wrong.	Toa diso io hevitra io.
They will be nowhere.	Tsy ho aiza izy ireo.
We just talked.	Niresaka fotsiny izahay.
It’s different when you find something for yourself.	Hafa mihitsy rehefa mahita zavatra ho anao ianao.
You can sit outside if the weather is nice.	Afaka mipetraka any ivelany ianao raha tsara ny andro.
Someone wants to talk to you there.	Misy olona te hiresaka aminao ao.

Everything is fine, especially in the coming year.	Tsara ny zava-drehetra, indrindra amin'ny taona ho avy.
I think he has a chance, yes.	Heveriko fa manana fahafahana izy, eny.
There was no time for that.	Tsy nisy fotoana ho an'izany.

This is one of my favorite times of the year.	Io no iray amin'ireo fotoana tiako indrindra amin'ny taona.
It goes well.	Mandeha tsara.
He was not very sick yet.	Mbola tsy narary mafy izy.
His may be coming soon.	Mety ho avy tsy ho ela ny azy.
Want to see how it goes?	Te hahita hoe manao ahoana izany?
I was a little scared.	Somary natahotra aho.
This is a real problem right now.	Tena olana izany amin'izao fotoana izao.
There should have been more.	Tokony ho nisy bebe kokoa.
We both had it.	Samy nanana izany izahay.
Because the evil is too great.	Satria lehibe loatra ny ratsy.

No one saw him.	Tsy nisy nahita azy.
It will tell me when it is ready.	Hilaza amiko izy io rehefa vonona.
We should not do that.	Tsy tokony hanao izany isika.
I really don’t believe in that stuff.	Tena tsy mino an'io zavatra io aho.

Everyone there loved him.	Samy tia azy daholo ny olona tany.
Here is someone to help you.	Ity misy olona hanampy anao.

The police have it.	Manana izany ny polisy.
I didn’t have that.	Tsy nanana an'izany aho.

I didn’t think of that.	Tsy nieritreritra an'izany aho.
It came in handy.	Tonga tamin'ny mora izany.

I have never seen him.	Mbola tsy nahita azy mihitsy aho.
It is a difficult task.	Asa sarotra izany.
As long as he swims, he may survive.	Raha mbola milomano izy dia mety ho velona.

Thank you.	Misaotra anao.
I had a good idea.	Nanana hevitra tsara aho.
You really can.	Tena azonao atao.
It can be a good thing or a bad thing.	Mety ho zavatra tsara izany na tsy mety.
He was not there.	Tsy tao izy.
It became a very good thing.	Lasa zavatra tsara loatra izany.
The work was not done properly.	Tsy vita araka ny tokony ho izy ny asa.
One needs to know.	Mila mahafantatra ny iray.
But there is still room for error here.	Saingy mbola misy toerana ho an'ny fahadisoana eto.

If you don’t, it may not be right for you.	Raha tsy manao izany ianao dia mety tsy mety aminao izany.
Every house and everything.	Ny trano rehetra sy ny zavatra rehetra.
He knows you.	Izy no mahalala anao.
I was real.	Tena nisy aho.
As it should be.	Araka ny tokony ho izy.
That was the real minute.	Izany no tena minitra.
Maybe when you’re older you’ll understand better.	Angamba raha efa lehibe ianao dia ho azonao tsara kokoa.
The day was full and hard.	Feno sy mafy ny andro.
I know it is.	Fantatro fa izy io.
I'm crazy.	Adala aho.
I never understood why.	Tsy azoko mihitsy ny antony.
It is difficult and different for me not to be there.	Sarotra sy hafa amiko ny tsy ho any.
Too scared to do anything.	Matahotra loatra ny hanao zavatra.
I enjoyed it.	Nahafinaritra ahy izany.
Then he will be ready to go.	Dia ho vonona ny handeha izy.
She is very happy.	Faly be izy.
He went to the other door.	Nandeha teo amin’ny varavarana hafa izy.
That is a very good and very good question.	Fanontaniana tena tsara sy tena tsara izany.
In the morning he felt better.	Ny maraina dia nahatsiaro ho tsara kokoa izy.
There is nothing more.	Tsy misy na inona na inona mihoatra.
Stupid question.	Fanontaniana adala.
That first week was really tough.	Tena mafy io herinandro voalohany io.
He would almost know.	Saika ho fantany angamba izy.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Angamba izy mahalala zavatra momba izany.
The idea is correct.	Marina ilay hevitra.
They are anxious to do good.	Manahy ny hanao zavatra tsara izy ireo.
It comes to others first, it shouldn’t.	Tonga ho an'ny hafa aloha izany, tsy tokony hisy.
They can have a few years and many hours.	Afaka manana taona vitsivitsy sy ora maro izy ireo.
Tell us what the problem is and why.	Lazao anay hoe inona no olana ary nahoana.
And it was fun.	Ary nahafinaritra izany.
They were really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra izy ireo.
I really believe that now.	Tena mino izany aho ankehitriny.
I needed them to help me.	Nila azy ireo aho mba hanampy ahy.
He was happy after he spoke.	Faly izy rehefa avy niteny.
I was just looking at you.	Nijery anao fotsiny aho.
They treated me like a child.	Nitondra ahy toy ny zaza izy ireo.
They are good, but not very good.	Tsara izy ireo, saingy tsy dia tsara loatra.
The room was lovely.	Nahafinaritra ilay efitrano.
It ate his heart out.	Nihinana ny fony izany.
The land was beautiful.	Nahafinaritra be ilay tany.
That was where he wanted her to be.	Teo no toerana tiany hisy azy.
I always thought about it.	Nieritreritra izany foana.
I can't stay home today.	Tsy afaka mijanona ao an-trano aho anio.
And you know that.	Ary fantatrao izany.
But that doesn’t get me anywhere.	Saingy tsy mitondra ahy ho aiza izany.
That's not an idea he understands.	Tsy hevitra azony izany.
Let's go home.	Aleo mody isika.
Hopefully you will do the same.	Manantena fa hanao toy izany koa ianao.
I’m pretty sure he doesn’t.	Tena azoko antoka fa tsy manao izany izy.
Such a good story.	Tantara tsara toy izany.
I've been there before.	Efa tany aho taloha.
I'm really not here.	Tena tsy eto aho.
I got news that wouldn’t have existed otherwise.	Nahazo vaovao tsy ho nisy aho raha tsy izany.
There is only one reason for this.	Iray ihany ny antony nahatonga izany.
I will be in front.	Izaho no ho eo aloha.
He worked hard all day.	Niasa mafy nandritra ny andro izy.
Month and month.	Volana sy volana.
That can't happen.	Tsy mety hitranga izany.
When they saw us, they didn’t say so.	Raha nahita anay izy ireo, dia tsy nilaza izany.
I'm not long.	Tsy ela aho.
I went alone now.	Nandeha irery aho izao.
And all dead places.	Ary ny toerana maty rehetra.
So it goes really well.	Ka tena mandeha tsara izany.
Today is a special holiday.	Fety manokana ny androany.
They really had the right reasons.	Tena nanana antony tokony ho izy ireo.
The man was not afraid.	Tsy natahotra ilay lehilahy.
Lots and lots.	Be dia be.
It was early in the morning.	Vao maraina izy.
She is my age, but very young.	Efa mitovy taona amiko izy, nefa tena kely.
I never want to see that.	Tsy te hahita an'izany mihitsy aho.
I will stay here one night but soon.	Hijanona eto indray alina aho fa tsy ho ela.
Of course, something is wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa misy zavatra tsy mety.
Because they think they can do it better.	Satria mihevitra izy ireo fa afaka manao izany tsara kokoa.
I don’t want to be forced.	Tsy te ho voatery aho.
You are very good to us.	Tena tsara aminay ianao.
They are good at it.	Mahay amin’izany izy ireo.
It’s easier if you know how.	Mora kokoa izany raha fantatrao ny fomba.
You can see it from there.	Afaka mahita azy avy amin'izany ianao.
I don’t care anymore.	Tsy miraharaha intsony aho.
Need a place soon.	Mila toerana tsy ho ela.
I was just thinking of you.	Nieritreritra anao fotsiny aho.
And you are good.	Ary tsara ianao.
He became a good friend.	Lasa namana tsara izy.
Not just now, though.	Tsy vao izao, na izany aza.
I didn’t have to tell him.	Tsy voatery nilaza taminy aho.
Then he looked at the others.	Dia nijery ny hafa izy.
We need to tell the truth.	Mila miteny ny marina isika.
They have traveled a long way.	Nandeha lavitra be izy ireo.
It’s something.	Zavatra izany.
Of course, that's good.	Mazava ho azy fa tsara izany.
Good stuff, obviously.	Zavatra tsara, mazava.
If nothing is done.	Raha tsy misy zavatra vita.
I'm sick.	Marary aho.
They could see it.	Afaka nahita izany izy ireo.
That could be a great story, if there is a story in it.	Mety ho tantara lehibe izany, raha misy tantara ao.
A moment that brought me to him.	Fotoana izay nahatonga ahy ho any aminy.
He really did what he had to do.	Nanao izay tokony hataony tokoa izy.
It seems like a long time ago.	Toa efa ela be izany.
Of course he was looking at one now.	Mazava ho azy fa nijery iray izy izao.
Didn't think to look at it.	Tsy nieritreritra ny hijery azy.
She usually wears a long dress.	Matetika izy no manao akanjo lava.
Like you, beautiful.	Tahaka anao, tsara tarehy.
Good kind, of course.	Ny karazana tsara, mazava ho azy.
They go everywhere.	Mandeha eny rehetra eny izy ireo.
You should not say bad things.	Tsy tokony hiresaka zavatra ratsy ianao.
These letters are yet to come.	Mbola ho avy ireo taratasy ireo.
He had problems of his own.	Nanana olana ho azy manokana izy.
I thought that would be what he would do.	Nihevitra aho fa izany no hataony.
He thought and reasoned.	Nieritreritra sy nieritreritra izy.
We just want to do the right thing.	Te hanao ny tsara fotsiny izahay.
I’m not interested in that kind of question.	Tsy liana amin'izany karazana fanontaniana izany aho.
It’s just not really mine.	Tsy tena ny ahy fotsiny.
Today is the same as any other day.	Tsy misy hafa amin’ny andro rehetra ny androany.
You should do these things.	Tokony hanao ireo zavatra ireo ianao.
Only those very close saw them.	Ireo tena akaiky ihany no nahita azy ireo.
I’m glad we do.	Faly aho fa manao izany isika.
You will stay close.	Hijanona akaiky ianao.
I am not alone in this.	Tsy irery aho amin'izany.
What else could it be.	Inona koa no mety ho izy.
Then we slept.	Dia natory izahay.
I could have done it.	Afaka nanao izany.
At the moment.	Amin'izao fotoana izao.
The best of.	Ny tsara indrindra amin'ny.
He is a very hard working teacher.	Mpampianatra tena miasa mafy izy.
He won't be able to help it.	Tsy ho afaka hanampy izany izy.
That could never be true.	Tsy mety ho marina mihitsy izany.
However, everyone knows.	Na izany aza, fantatry ny rehetra.
It seems like years ago.	Toa taona lasa izay.
They already exist.	Efa misy izy ireo izao.
I hope this helps people.	Manantena aho fa manampy olona izany.
He made me look like him, and there was no problem.	Nataony ho tahaka azy aho, ary tsy nisy olana.
We need to think a little.	Mila mieritreritra kely isika.
They could be.	Mety ho izy ireo.
Yes, it may not be perfect.	Eny, mety tsy tanteraka.
Maybe he was ‘different’ from her.	Angamba izy 'hafa' taminy.
We are in a very exciting year.	Ao anatin’ny taona tena mahafinaritra isika.
He had good friends.	Nanana namana tsara izy.
There is no past, no present, no future.	Tsy misy lasa, tsy misy ankehitriny, tsy misy ho avy.
Not when he gets too far.	Tsy rehefa tonga lavitra izy.
He had never seen anyone like him.	Mbola tsy nahita olona toa azy mihitsy izy.
Must see.	Tsy maintsy hahita.
However, it is certainly fun to watch.	Na izany aza, azo antoka fa mahafinaritra ny mijery.
The girl died.	Maty ilay tovovavy.
I am yours, just as you are mine.	Anao aho, toy ny ahy koa ianao.
Neither are we.	Tsy isika ihany koa.
There is nothing he likes better.	Tsy misy zavatra tiany kokoa.
It just can’t be done.	Tsy azo atao fotsiny.
He had never seen her before.	Mbola tsy nahita azy mihitsy izy.
He was there.	Tao izy.
Whatever it is.	Na inona na inona izany.
He's going to be here now.	Handeha eto izy izao.
Although we are both not allowed to do that anymore.	Na dia samy tsy mahazo manao izany intsony aza izahay.
Or they may be wrong.	Na mety ho diso izy ireo.
The present tense.	Ny fotoana ankehitriny.
She wasn't sure what to do next.	Tsy azony antoka izay tokony hataony manaraka.
I’m not sitting here just talking.	Tsy mipetraka eto aho fa miteny fotsiny.
Everything went back fine.	Niverina tsara ny zava-drehetra.
If so, everything will be lost.	Raha izany no izy dia ho very daholo ny zava-drehetra.
It’s always hard to swim to the top, but it’s impossible.	Sarotra foana ny milomano any ambony, fa tsy azo atao.
He knows it now.	Fantany izany ankehitriny.
They had to see.	Tsy maintsy nahita izy ireo.
It all has to go.	Tsy maintsy mandeha daholo izany.
The night was wonderful.	Nahafinaritra ny alina.
I was so scared.	Natahotra mafy aho.
That kind of thing is really wrong.	Tena diso izany karazana zavatra izany.
I didn't say that.	Tsy niteny izany aho.
Don’t just sit around like a fool.	Aza mipetraka toy ny adala fotsiny.
We have to talk about it.	Tsy maintsy miresaka momba izany isika.
He was looking forward to going home.	Nanantena mafy ny hody izy.
The big problem right now.	Ny olana lehibe amin'izao fotoana izao.
They thought they were going to survive.	Nieritreritra ny ho velona izy ireo.
It should never come to that.	Tsy tokony ho tonga amin'izany mihitsy.
Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.	Aza matahotra ny hanao fahadisoana.
That’s a really good idea.	Tena hevitra tsara izany.
He studied more and thought about everything.	Nianatra bebe kokoa izy ary nieritreritra ny zava-drehetra.
This is not the last time.	Tsy izao no fotoana farany.
I have no information about him.	Tsy manana vaovao momba azy aho.
Now it goes.	Ankehitriny dia mandeha.
I have a reason.	Manana ny antony aho.
The money was there.	Teo ny vola.
When we started.	Rehefa nanomboka izahay.
He then went to sleep.	Lasa natory izy avy eo.
Who knows not to speak.	Izay mahalala tsy miteny.
It worked well.	Niasa tsara izany.
He seemed to know.	Toa fantany izy.
I know a lot of other songs.	Mahalala hira maro hafa aho.
The woman seemed happy.	Toa faly ilay vehivavy.
I really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy.
I can't tell you much.	Tsy afaka milaza zavatra betsaka aminao aho.
He could not tell her what to do.	Tsy afaka nilaza taminy izay tokony hataony izy.
For about two months, he worked every day.	Nandritra ny roa volana teo ho eo, dia niasa isan’andro izy.
I was finally able to sleep.	Afaka natory ihany aho tamin’ny farany.
And still.	Ary mbola.
It was nice to sit down.	Nahafinaritra ny nipetraka.
We will be together next year.	Hiaraka isika amin’ny taona ho avy.
I like the rain.	Tiako ny orana.
It will not happen.	Tsy ho tanteraka izany.
He had never done that before.	Mbola tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy taloha.
You have already done so.	Efa nanao izany ianao.
It doesn't suit him.	Tsy mety aminy izany.
I still think we have it.	Mbola mihevitra aho fa manana izany isika.
I wonder if he saw anything that made him leave.	Manontany tena aho raha nahita zavatra nahatonga azy hiala izy.
It might win.	Mety handresy izany.
Of course he was interested.	Mazava ho azy fa liana izy.
You know very well.	Fantatrao tsara.
I think there are two things going on there.	Heveriko fa misy zavatra roa mandeha any.
Throughout the year.	Nandritra ny taona.
And yet, they are very similar.	Ary na izany aza, dia mitovy be.
She thought of her children.	Nieritreritra ny zanany izy.
I know everyone is busy.	Fantatro fa sahirana ny rehetra.
So it’s better for him to have money than none.	Noho izany dia aleo izy manana vola toy izay tsy misy.
I think that's true.	Heveriko fa marina izany.
If you don’t have it, you don’t get it.	Raha tsy manana ianao dia tsy azonao izany.
I wished better for him.	Naniry tsara kokoa ho azy aho.
He is not happy.	Tsy faly izy.
And they started playing new music for me.	Ary nanomboka nilalao mozika vaovao ho ahy izy ireo.
Or maybe yes, but not in you.	Na angamba eny, fa tsy ao aminao.
It was the journey.	Dia ilay dia.
The latter is not possible.	Ity farany dia tsy azo atao.
Maybe it’s just something that exists.	Angamba zavatra misy fotsiny izany.
I was sick.	narary aho.
He knew it was in one place.	Fantany fa teo amin'ny toerana iray izany.
The reason becomes clear.	Lasa mazava ny antony.
That is where we are today.	Izany no misy antsika amin'izao andro izao.
But no one does much about them.	Saingy tsy misy olona manao zavatra betsaka momba azy ireo.
But of course not.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy izany.
He never knew what had caused it.	Tsy fantany mihitsy hoe inona no nahatonga izany.
We need to do something about it.	Tokony hanao zavatra momba izany isika.
It went well to the end.	Nandeha tsara izany hatramin’ny farany.
Anyone have any questions?	Misy manana fanontaniana ve?
The problem is not them.	Ny olana dia tsy izy ireo.
They are all from outside.	Izy rehetra avy any ivelany.
The film may be lost.	Mety ho very ilay sarimihetsika.
Ela ela, lasa.	Ela ela, lasa.
Many and one.	Maro ary iray.
That’s good, but still not enough.	Tsara izany, saingy mbola tsy ampy.
I'm sure it will be done.	Azoko antoka fa ho tanteraka izany.
Either way, yours is right.	Na izany na tsy izany, marina ny anao.
No one really does that.	Tsy misy manao izany tokoa.
Or, he may have known that the first one was for him.	Na, mety ho fantany fa ho azy ny voalohany.
They had no other way.	Tsy nanana lalana hafa izy ireo.
Very good.	Tena tsara.
We were able to get help.	Nahavita nahazo fanampiana izahay.
He always reads, always looks.	Mamaky teny foana izy, mijery foana.
This is a very difficult task.	Tena asa sarotra tokoa izany.
And you will never know the truth.	Ary tsy ho fantatrao mihitsy ny marina.
We really can’t do more than that.	Tena tsy afaka manao mihoatra noho izany isika.
I asked if he did.	Nanontany aho raha nanao izany izy.
I always had it.	Nanana izany foana.
Just a little sick.	Marary kely fotsiny.
A little is enough.	Kely dia ampy.
But you have to have luck.	Saingy tsy maintsy manana vintana ianao.
This is my favorite picture.	Ity no sary tiako indrindra.
I learned a lot there.	Nianatra zavatra betsaka aho tany.
Like, really love it.	Toy ny, tena tia azy.
You need to talk to me about it.	Mila miresaka amiko momba izany ianao.
To do so.	Mba hanaovana izany.
But don't speak, can't speak.	Fa tsy miteny, tsy afaka miteny.
He thought of the people he loved.	Nieritreritra ny olona tiany izy.
Only one can last.	Iray ihany no mety ho farany.
The woman is his.	Azy ilay vehivavy.
He looked away.	Nijery lavitra izy.
I believe it is possible.	Mino aho fa azo atao izany.
We were so happy that we didn’t sleep through the night.	Faly be izahay ka tsy natory ny alina.
I don't see the error.	Tsy hitako ilay fahadisoana.
And in fact, it has to be.	Ary raha ny marina, dia tsy maintsy ho izany.
Thank you for asking me.	Misaotra anao nanontany ahy.
Couldn't go the same way.	Tsy afaka nandeha tamin'ny lalana mitovy.
Not difficult, but very necessary.	Tsy sarotra, fa tena ilaina.
So now, then.	Dia izao, avy eo.
You are everywhere.	Eny rehetra eny ianao.
He wasn't even sure if he could say anything.	Tsy azony antoka akory raha afaka miteny na inona na inona izy.
We have to do both.	Tsy maintsy manao ny roa isika.
He didn't.	Tsy nanao izany izy.
It's been too long.	Efa ela loatra.
It may be new.	Mety ho vaovao ilay izy.
You are happy to be with us.	Faly ianao niaraka taminay.
It's been too long.	Efa ela loatra izany.
At the same time.	Mandritra izany fotoana izany.
You said you could.	Nilaza ianao fa afaka.
Nice to see you.	Mahafinaritra ny mahita anao.
Not many, but a few.	Tsy betsaka, fa vitsivitsy.
So that's it.	Ka izany no izy.
It may indeed be.	Mety ho izany tokoa.
He doesn't seem to have any friends.	Toa tsy manana namana izy.
He knew he could say no.	Fantany fa afaka miteny izy hoe tsia.
Someone stopped to help.	Nisy nijanona nanampy.
We will talk about that soon.	Hiresaka momba izany tsy ho ela isika.
I see you when you are away from them.	Hitako ianao rehefa lavitra azy ireo.
He was confused.	Very hevitra izy.
I can do something for you.	Afaka manao zavatra ho anao aho.
I know it helped people.	Fantatro fa nanampy olona izany.
And he did so.	Dia nataony izany.
Little to get out of the rain.	Kely ny miala amin'ny orana.
Then the first book came out.	Dia nivoaka ny boky voalohany.
You really like it.	Tena tianao izany.
I think it was talking about something else.	Heveriko fa niresaka zavatra hafa izany.
He didn’t want to make that mistake again.	Tsy te hanao izany fahadisoana izany indray izy.
You really don’t.	Tena tsy manao izany ianao.

Others may become very angry, especially if they see this.	Mety ho tezitra mafy ny hafa, indrindra raha nahita izany.
The car is close.	Efa akaiky ny fiara.
They did more than that.	Nanao mihoatra noho izany izy ireo.
I know that is true.	Fantatro fa marina izany.
He did not understand what was happening.	Tsy azony ny zava-nitranga.
Exactly the same as the previous three.	Mitovy tanteraka amin'ny telo teo aloha.
That's why.	Antony izany.
I need something long but not too long.	Mila zavatra lava aho fa tsy ela loatra.
I know it’s not easy, but you can do it well.	Fantatro fa tsy mora izany, saingy azonao atao tsara izany.
What, he didn’t know.	Inona, tsy fantany.
They both do beautiful things.	Samy manao zavatra tsara tarehy.
It scared me now.	Natahotra ahy izao.
Yes, if he was there he could have stayed there.	Eny, raha teo izy dia afaka nijanona teo.
Everything was different then.	Hafa ny zava-drehetra tamin’izany.
We hoped the work would be easy.	Nanantena izahay fa ho mora ny asa.
It doesn’t look good.	Toa tsy tsara.
man! 	lehilahy!
You will meet him.	Hihaona aminy ianao.

So am I.	Toy izany koa aho.
Now that they were together, they didn’t know what to do.	Ankehitriny rehefa niaraka izy ireo dia tsy fantany izay tokony hatao.
Maybe it’s better if you learn to swim.	Angamba tsara kokoa raha mianatra milomano ianao.
It’s farther away.	Lavitra kokoa izany.
Today, he is lucky.	Androany, tsara vintana izy.
I study here in the evening.	Mianatra eto aho ny hariva.
I can no longer watch him die.	Tsy afaka mijery azy maty intsony aho.
I just knew it would happen one day.	Fantatro fotsiny fa hitranga izany indray andro any.
That's it.	Izay izany.
I asked if he needed help.	Nanontany aho raha mila fanampiana izy.
She saw him at the party and was happy.	Nahita azy tany amin'ny fety izy ary faly.
A lot of things happened today.	Maro ny zavatra nitranga androany.

They walk because they walk.	Mandeha izy ireo satria mandeha.
Thank you for providing a wonderful book idea !.	Misaotra anao nanome hevitra boky mahafinaritra!.
Men are more likely than women to return.	Ny lehilahy no azo inoana kokoa noho ny vehivavy hiverina.
Maybe too much.	Be loatra angamba.
He knows me well.	Fantany tsara aho.
They are real.	Tena izy ireo.
It's not too late, you know.	Mbola tsy tara izao, fantatrao.
This is a great tragedy.	Loza lehibe izany.

He is not a friend.	Tsy namana izy.
These cannot be ours.	Tsy mety ho antsika ireo.
He did not know where the man was from.	Tsy fantany hoe avy taiza io lehilahy io.
They refused to enter the room.	Tsy nety niditra tao amin’ilay efitrano izy ireo.
She is very happy.	Tena faly be izy.
Not in the right place.	Tsy teo amin'ny toerana mety.
It’s so easy.	Tena mora izany.
He believes he is okay.	Mino izy fa tsy maninona izy.
I knew something was going to happen.	Fantatro fa hisy zavatra hitranga.
A little luck also helps.	Ny vintana kely dia manampy ihany koa.
I’ve seen too much but it’s not either.	Be loatra ny hitako fa tsy izany koa.
We are different here.	Hafa isika eto.
Of course, this is not true.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy marina izany.
More likely, he was simply unconscious.	Azo inoana kokoa fa tsy nahatsiaro tena fotsiny izy.
You will leave here.	Hiala eto ianao.
So none of the first times.	Ka tsy misy iray amin'ireo fotoana voalohany.
Just for that, they are very worried.	Ho an'izany fotsiny dia manahy be izy ireo.
I have never heard anything like it.	Tsy mbola nandre zavatra toy izany aho.
I should never have done that, of course.	Tsy tokony ho nanao izany mihitsy aho, mazava ho azy.
I know you can't go far.	Fantatro fa tsy afaka lavitra ianao.
Maybe you will.	Angamba ho ianao.
We don’t need that next time.	Tsy mila izany isika amin'ny manaraka.
You next time.	Ianao amin'ny manaraka.
He’s kind of a player to me.	Karazana mpilalao ahy izy.
I can’t play that way.	Tsy afaka milalao amin'izany fomba izany aho.
Like, really sorry.	Toy ny, tena miala tsiny.
I don't want to be late.	Tsy te ho tara aho.
We’ve had a lot of things like that before.	Nahazo zavatra maro toy izany izahay taloha.
It's mine, you know.	Ahy io, fantatrao.
I don't like it here.	Tsy tiako eto.
To my surprise, there was nothing.	Gaga aho fa tsy nisy na inona na inona.
You were still there.	Teo ihany ianao.
This is a wonderful place in a beautiful place.	Ity dia toerana mahafinaritra amin'ny toerana mahafinaritra.
And then they don’t do the same.	Ary avy eo dia tsy manao izany koa izy ireo.
He seemed happy.	Toa faly izy.
It’s hard to see that.	Sarotra ny mahita izany.
He is still a man.	Mbola lehilahy izy.
The night went by.	Nandeha ny alina.
He started earlier.	Nanomboka teo aloha izy.
No two paths are the same, however.	Tsy misy lalana roa mitovy, na izany aza.
Both are lost.	Samy very.
Nothing is too close to that.	Tsy misy na inona na inona akaiky loatra izany.
We are not the same.	Tsy mitovy ihany isika.
This letter has gone too far.	Lasa lavitra ity taratasy ity.
Have you been out today?	Efa tany ivelany ve ianao androany?
You are wrong.	Diso hevitra ianao.
I never thought this would happen to me.	Tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho fa hitranga amiko izany.
Like me, the least here.	Toa ahy, ny kely indrindra eto.
Time goes by too fast.	Mandeha haingana loatra ny fotoana.
They still did it.	Mbola nanao izany ihany izy ireo.
I will help you tomorrow.	Hanampy anao aho rahampitso.
A few more.	Vitsivitsy hafa.
She was glad she didn't see him.	Faly izy fa tsy nahita azy.
He stopped and waited.	Nijanona izy ary niandry.
What is wrong is wrong and wrong.	Ny tsy mety dia tsy mety ary tsy mety.
You need the best people at work.	Mila olona tsara indrindra amin'ny asa ianao.
Whatever.	Na inona na inona.
Everything else today will be talked about.	Ny zavatra hafa rehetra anio dia hiresaka momba azy.

I don't even know mine.	Ny ahy aza tsy haiko.
They are very happy.	Tena faly izy ireo.
However, here we are.	Na izany aza, eto isika.
It may not be you.	Mety tsy ianao izany.
That's right, that's right.	Marina izany, marina izany.
It seemed to make me a new person.	Toa nahatonga olona vaovao ho ahy izany.
He is here now.	Eto izy izao.
The party was great.	Tena tsara ny fety.
Is there anything else? 	Misy zavatra hafa ve?
I really learned something.	Tena nianatra zavatra aho.
Or you can.	Na azonao atao.
He doesn’t like her personally.	Tsy tiany manokana izy.
He just told me.	Nilaza tamiko fotsiny.
I found a way.	Nahita fomba aho.
He didn’t just tell me.	Tsy nilaza tamiko fotsiny izy.
He tried one.	Nanandrana iray izy.
When this actually happened, he said nothing.	Rehefa nitranga tokoa izany dia tsy niteny na inona na inona izy.
It doesn't just happen.	Tsy hoe tonga ho azy izany.
Not many get that opportunity.	Tsy maro no mahazo izany fahafahana izany.
I see a few issues with that.	Mahita olana vitsivitsy momba izany aho.
Yes of course.	Eny, mazava ho azy.
I could never stop.	Tsy afaka nijanona mihitsy aho.
So he went first.	Dia nandeha aloha izy.
There is simply no way.	Tsy misy fomba fotsiny.
He knows the place.	Fantany io toerana io.
I know someone died.	Fantatro fa nisy maty.
Because I needed one.	Satria nila iray aho.
Let's talk first.	Aleo aloha hiresaka.
The house is quite large.	Ny trano dia somary lehibe.
You have to be outside.	Tokony ho any ivelany ianao.
He must die.	Tsy maintsy maty izy.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Iza ary aiza, ahoana ary nahoana, oviana ary inona.
He studied for three hours.	Nianatra adiny telo izy.
He was very sure.	Tena azony antoka.
I was most surprised.	Gaga indrindra aho.
This is true of both men and women.	Marina izany na amin'ny lehilahy na amin'ny vehivavy.
You can’t be angry about that.	Tsy afaka tezitra amin'izany ianao.
Or could it be something else?	Sa mety ho zavatra hafa?
You told me that.	Nilaza izany tamiko ianao.
The movie will be out soon.	Hivoaka tsy ho ela ny sarimihetsika.
Yours is different.	Hafa ny anao.
Although we didn’t do much.	Na dia tsy nanao be dia be aza izahay.
I'll be back tomorrow.	hiverina aho rahampitso.
There seems to be no rain at all on the day.	Toa tsy misy orana mihitsy ny andro.
You called me again and asked for help.	Ianao no niantso ahy indray ary nangataka fanampiana.
The breakfast was very good.	Tena tsara ny sakafo maraina.
Went to him for two months.	Nandeha tany aminy nandritra ny roa volana.
He was just a friend.	Namana fotsiny izy.
Have you read the story?	Efa namaky ny tantara ve ianao?
I really like him.	Tena tiako izy.
That's exactly what he wants to do with it.	Izany indrindra no tiany hatao amin’izany.
I'm glad you came with me.	Faly aho fa tonga hiaraka amiko ianao.
We have enough.	Manana ny ampy isika.
I think.	Mieritreritra aho.
We do that.	Manao izany izahay.
What he did.	Inona no nataony.
No, you don’t have to do everything alone.	Tsia, tsy voatery manao ny zava-drehetra irery ianao.
I don’t know what will happen.	Tsy fantatro izay hitranga.
He doesn’t know what a job is.	Tsy fantany ny atao hoe asa.
I had to sleep.	Tsy maintsy natory aho.
Die like everything.	Maty toy ny zavatra rehetra.
This is the worst thing that can happen.	Izany no zavatra ratsy indrindra mety hitranga.
They were very skilled.	Tena nahay izy ireo.
Then we entered.	Dia niditra izahay.
Where are they from?	Avy taiza izy ireo?
He is too long gone.	Efa ela loatra izy no lasa.
It doesn’t have to be a bad thing.	Tsy voatery ho zavatra ratsy izany.
You’re not so crazy because he’s crazy.	Tsy dia adala ianao satria adala izy.
Thanks for all the help on this.	Misaotra amin'ny fanampiana rehetra momba izany.
Looked the other way.	Nijery ny lalana hafa.
I remember you well.	Tadidiko tsara ianao.
I am angry.	Tezitra aho.
You need someone like me.	Mila olona toa ahy ianao.
I really did.	Tena nanao izany aho.
This one is true.	Marina ity iray ity.
I'll get one soon.	Hahazo iray aho tsy ho ela.
Thank you for telling me that mornings work better.	Misaotra anao nilaza tamiko fa miasa tsara kokoa ny maraina.
This is not very true now.	Tsy dia marina loatra izany ankehitriny.
The child is a problem.	Olana ilay zaza.
I have too.	Izaho koa manana.
It doesn’t always work.	Tsy mandeha foana izany.
He wants to live.	Te ho velona izy.
I saw a man who actually bought one.	Nahita lehilahy iray tena nividy iray aho.
That seems to be true.	Toa marina izany.
It really talked about something.	Niresaka zavatra tokoa ilay izy.
He heard nothing again.	Tsy nandre na inona na inona indray izy.
Or maybe it didn’t.	Na angamba tsy nisy izany.
You might tell me.	Mety hilaza amiko ianao.
You know you don’t need to sleep.	Fantatrao fa tsy mila matory ianao.
But still, he was glad he got there.	Fa na izany aza dia faly izy fa tonga teo izy.
That's right.	Izany tokoa.
I'm glad he's with me.	Faly aho fa miaraka amiko izy.
This is because he is a dog.	Izany dia satria alika izy.
There is a better way to do it.	Misy fomba tsara kokoa hanaovana izany.
We can talk about it here.	Afaka miresaka momba izany isika eto.
We are.	Izahay dia.

A lot has happened.	Betsaka ny nitranga.
It shouldn't be.	Tsy tokony ho izany.

It’s really good.	Tena tsara izy io.
He cannot die.	Tsy mety maty izy.
There was no time for anything.	Tsy nisy fotoana na inona na inona.
Children are morning people.	Olona maraina ny ankizy.
The road is really bad.	Tena ratsy ny lalana.
The man has grown up.	Efa lehibe ilay lehilahy.

Will be back tomorrow afternoon.	Hiverina rahampitso tolakandro.
He loves it.	Tiany izany.
And you are absolutely right.	Ary tena marina koa ianao.
It’s very appropriate.	Tena mety izany.
This is especially true when the end is near.	Marina indrindra izany rehefa akaiky ny farany.
Who is this man?	Iza io lehilahy io?
It was him.	Izy ilay izy.
This is good news.	Vaovao tsara izany.

Still did it.	Mbola nanao izany ihany.

We talked about it.	Niresaka an'izany izahay.
But maybe it’s just me.	Fa angamba izaho ihany.
He went.	Nandeha izy.

If so, he is wrong.	Raha izany no izy, dia diso izy.
I hope they find someone to help.	Manantena aho fa hahita olona manampy izy ireo.
Here and there.	Teo ary teo.
I called him.	Niantso azy aho.

Then something happened.	Nisy zavatra nitranga avy eo.
It’s like we’re not enough.	Toy ny hoe tsy ampy izahay.

People do it every day.	Manao izany isan’andro ny olona.
And here we are.	Ary eto no misy antsika.

There seems to be no end to the journey.	Toa tsy misy farany ny dia.
He thought a little.	Nieritreritra kely izy.
Don’t drink and drive.	Aza misotro sy mitondra fiara.
Nor did he tell her that it would not come to her.	Tsy nilaza taminy koa izy fa tsy ho tonga any aminy izany.

I know right.	Haiko tsara.
But what a picture.	Fa sary inona.
No one is watching.	Tsy misy mijery.
And now it's his.	Ary ankehitriny izy dia azy.

Maybe next summer.	Angamba amin'ny fahavaratra manaraka.
Great food.	Sakafo mahafinaritra.

Worse, in fact.	Ratsy kokoa, raha ny marina.

He had been waiting in this room for two hours.	Efa adiny roa no niandry tao amin’ity efitrano ity izy.
She is afraid of me.	Matahotra ahy izy.
Of course, it shouldn’t be there.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy tokony ho eo izany.

You were not afraid.	Tsy natahotra ianao.
They live here.	Mipetraka eto izy ireo.

There are men in there, or there have been.	Misy lehilahy ao, na nisy.
There is nothing like it.	Tsy misy toa azy.
The path is clear if.	Mazava ny lalana raha.
But it's not.	Saingy tsy izany.
There was still something else to be gained.	Mbola nisy zavatra hafa tokony ho azo.
That is and should be.	Izany dia ary tokony ho izany.
We are too late.	Tara andro loatra izahay.

And finally her loved ones died.	Ary maty farany ireo olona tiany indrindra.
And then, it’s not pretty.	Ary avy eo, tsy tsara tarehy.
Can you swim?	Mahay milomano ve ianao?
A lot of people were afraid of him.	Be dia be ny olona natahotra azy.
Lucky you.	Tsara vintana ianao.
Then it happened.	Dia nitranga izany.
That way you can have the full story.	Amin'izany dia afaka manana ny tantara feno ianao.
If you think this is crazy, just leave.	Raha heverinao fa adala izany dia miala fotsiny.
He entered the room.	Niditra tao amin'ilay efitrano izy.
That is not enough.	Tsy ampy izany.
Don't worry.	Aza manahy ianao.
People didn’t want him here.	Olona tsy naniry azy teto.
Something else happened.	Mbola nisy zavatra hafa nitranga.
I read it to the end.	Namaky azy aho hatramin'ny farany.
You will always love him.	Ho tia azy foana ianao.
I really met you.	Tena nihaona taminao aho.
I think that’s fun.	Heveriko fa mahafinaritra izany.
You are beautiful.	Tsara tarehy ianao.
Which could be the same.	Izay mety ho toy izany koa.
You can sit here in the car if you like.	Afaka mipetraka eto anaty fiara ianao raha tianao.
That should be enough.	Tokony ho ampy izay.
These are the first days.	Andro voalohany ireo.
All men of course.	Ny lehilahy rehetra mazava ho azy.
But it works for us.	Fa miasa ho antsika izany.
I have to talk to him alone.	Tsy maintsy miresaka aminy irery aho.
You did not eat.	Tsy nihinana ianao.
And of course he had help.	Ary mazava ho azy fa nanana fanampiana izy.
The other children.	Ny ankizy hafa.
You don’t like it.	Tsy tianao izany.
And that’s a big problem right now.	Ary olana lehibe izany amin'izao fotoana izao.
In fact, many.	Raha ny marina, maro.
But you can't.	Saingy tsy afaka ianao.
There is nothing between me and you.	Tsy misy na inona na inona eo amiko sy ianao.
He talked at length about the problem.	Niresaka lava momba ilay olana izy.
We decided it wasn’t too bad so we started.	Nanapa-kevitra izahay fa tsy dia ratsy izany ka nanomboka.
I don’t know how to do it.	Tsy haiko ny fomba hanaovana izany.
They had to meet again.	Tsy maintsy nihaona indray izy ireo.
I thought it was just a big party.	Noheveriko fa fety be fotsiny ilay izy.
He’s the kind of player.	Izy no karazana mpilalao.
Now everything is going well for him.	Ankehitriny dia mandeha tsara ho azy ny zava-drehetra.
And the same question remains.	Ary mbola misy fanontaniana mitovy.
All of this will not be easy.	Tsy ho mora izany rehetra izany.
I can't think of a song.	Tsy afaka mieritreritra hira aho.
We have to leave now.	Tsy maintsy miala izao isika.
You may only get one chance, you may not get it.	Mety hahazo vintana iray fotsiny ianao, mety tsy hahazo.
The baby slept late that morning.	Natory tara ilay zaza io maraina io.
I can’t worry about the end.	Tsy afaka manahy aho amin'ny farany.
So it’s for me now.	Dia ho ahy izany ankehitriny.
I think that was new to him.	Heveriko fa vaovao taminy izany.
Either way, it will be a long time coming.	Na izany na tsy izany, dia ho lava be izany.
The same is true.	Toy izany koa.
I had to do something.	Tsy maintsy nanao zavatra aho.
We love them when we see them.	Tia azy ireo isika rehefa mahita azy ireo.
Are you angry about what happened.	Tezitra amin'ny zava-nitranga ve ianao.
Yes, it is not.	Eny, tsy izany.
I have tried everything.	Efa nanandrana ny zavatra rehetra aho.
But there may not be many others.	Saingy mety tsy ho maro ny hafa.
You better do that.	Aleo manao izany ianao.
It’s hard to see what’s wrong with that.	Sarotra ny mahita ny tsy mety amin'izany.
It was a party house.	Trano fanaovana fety ilay izy.
I watched them walk and walk.	Nijery azy ireo nandeha sy nandeha aho.
I never enjoyed driving.	Tsy nahafinaritra ahy mihitsy ny nitondra fiara.
It helps, but it’s not necessary.	Manampy izany, saingy tsy ilaina izany.
Then we talked.	Dia niresaka izahay.
I know that.	Fantatro izany.
He was the one who refused.	Izy no tsy nety.
The journey is not always easy.	Tsy mora foana ny dia.
He was very sick when he was a child.	Narary mafy fony izy mbola kely.
I don't think you understand that.	Heveriko fa tsy azonao izany.
He said he liked it.	Nilaza izy fa tiany izany.
The man was very angry.	Tezitra be ilay lehilahy.
That will be it.	Izany no ho izy.
I behave very well.	Mitondra tena tsara aho.
I think it’s going to be really fun.	Heveriko fa ho tena mahafinaritra izany.
Although they are small.	Na dia kely aza izy ireo.
And he was angry, very angry.	Ary tezitra izy, tezitra mafy.
Otherwise, she’s just beautiful.	Raha tsy izany dia tsara tarehy fotsiny izy.
If only you could.	Raha azonao atao ihany.
He is someone you want to be there.	Olona tianao ho eo izy.
Works fine, no problem with that.	Miasa tsara, tsy misy olana amin'izany.
You have done a lot of work today.	Efa nanao asa betsaka ianao androany.
That's not right.	Tsy mety amin’izany.
And stayed for about an hour.	Ary nijanona adiny iray teo ho eo.
Maybe it shouldn’t be.	Angamba tsy tokony ho izy.
If there is anything to know.	Raha misy zavatra ho fantatra.
He seemed scared.	Toa natahotra izy.
i will go	handeha aho.
He didn't want to talk.	Tsy te hiresaka izy.
But it has already happened.	Saingy efa nitranga izany.
They often go at night.	Matetika izy ireo no mandeha amin'ny alina.
It's as bad as ever.	Ratsy toy ny teo aloha izao.
They really did it as best they could.	Tena nanao izany araka izay azo atao izy ireo.
He still loves her.	Mbola tiany izy.
We are late.	Tara izahay.
Nothing for sure, of course.	Tsy nisy azo antoka, mazava ho azy.
I ask too much.	be loatra aho manontany.
I will not tell others.	Tsy hilaza ny hafa aho.
I want to help you.	Te hanampy anao aho.
He may not get another time.	Mety tsy hahazo fotoana hafa izy.
It became difficult for me not to tell him anything.	Lasa sarotra tamiko ny tsy nilaza zavatra taminy.
But it went fast.	Saingy lasa haingana izany.
There was no final word.	Tsy nisy teny farany.
I needed to look at them now.	Nila nijery azy ireo izao.
He will do anything.	Hanao na inona na inona izy.
I talked about what he did.	Niresaka momba ny nataony aho.
There was no music playing.	Tsy nisy mozika nilalao.
So you had a mistake.	Noho izany dia nanana fahadisoana ianao.
This is indeed true.	Marina tokoa izany.
I am older.	Lehibe aho.
I can't think of anything else.	Tsy afaka mieritreritra zavatra hafa aho.
And one of those people, for me, is me.	Ary ny iray amin'ireo olona ireo, ho ahy, dia izaho.
People know him.	Fantatry ny olona izy.
Had no problem.	Tsy nanana olana.
He heard a lot of danger outside.	Nandre loza maro be teo ivelany izy.
The bad news goes fast.	Mandeha haingana ny vaovao ratsy.
This is not bad.	Tsy ratsy izany.
We finally found a home without any problems.	Nahita trano tsy nisy olana izahay tamin’ny farany.
Don’t read too much into it.	Aza mamaky be loatra ao.
We have to leave now.	Tsy maintsy miala isika izao.
You don’t even know what it feels like to me.	Tsy fantatrao akory hoe manao ahoana izany amiko.
The car seemed to call to him.	Toa niantso azy ilay fiara.
It won’t be, it won’t be, it won’t be.	Tsy ho izany, tsy ho izany, tsy ho izany.
Everything is working fine.	Miasa tsara ny zava-drehetra.

A house needs people in it.	Mila olona ao ny trano iray.
I think you do something.	Mieritreritra aho fa manao zavatra ianao.

I love this dress.	Tiako ity akanjo ity.
He knows this very well.	Fantany tsara izany.
I know there is something else to it.	Fantatro fa misy zavatra hafa amin'izany.

Yes, more than a fool.	Eny, mihoatra ny adala.
This man is very tall.	Lava be io lehilahy io.

He knew it was better to go to bed early.	Fantany fa tsara kokoa ny matory aloha.
We did that.	Nanao izany izahay.
There is none of that.	Tsy misy izany rehetra izany.

He really should.	Tena tokony izy.
And he is very close.	Ary tena akaiky tokoa izy.
He has now learned how to be about her.	Efa nianatra ny fomba momba azy izy izao.
But not much.	Saingy tsy dia betsaka.
But he made a face.	Fa nanao tarehy izy.
They have a difficult history.	Manana tantara sarotra izy ireo.
At first, he didn’t know where he was and why.	Tamin'ny voalohany dia tsy fantany hoe taiza izy ary nahoana.
He never called her a friend.	Tsy niantso azy hoe namana mihitsy.
I think that would be good.	Heveriko fa ho tsara izany.
Not just the type of money.	Tsy ny karazana vola ihany.
I want to go home.	Te hody aho.
But there was more to it than that.	Saingy nisy mihoatra noho izany.

He is still alive.	Mbola velona ihany izy.

But still no luck.	Saingy mbola tsy misy vintana.
He finally hoped she was waiting for him now.	Nanantena ihany izy fa niandry azy izy izao.
He didn't write anything.	Tsy nanoratra na inona na inona izy.
If I love you.	Raha tiako ianao.
I plan to go there in a few years.	Mikasa ny handeha any aho afaka taona vitsivitsy.
He may be lost.	Mety ho very izy.
There he grew up.	Teo izy no lehibe.
There seems to be a lot that could have happened.	Toa be dia be ny zavatra mety nitranga.
Now that is not the case.	Ankehitriny dia tsy misy izany.
That can't happen.	Tsy mety hitranga izany.
Or more than that.	Na mihoatra noho izany.
Nothing was done about it.	Tsy nisy zavatra vita tamin’izany.
He traveled often and often arrived late.	Nandeha matetika izy ary matetika no tonga tara.
You have made me a better person.	Nahatonga ahy ho olona tsara kokoa ianao.
Neither of you told anyone.	Samy tsy nilaza na iza na iza ianareo.
You are for me.	Ho ahy ianao.
This is very sick.	Tena marary ity.
He says he needs the money.	Milaza izy fa mila ny vola.
And he started with nothing.	Ary nanomboka tsy nisy na inona na inona izy.
But there is.	Fa misy.
About the car.	Momba ny fiara.
Sooner or later, he will have to talk to her.	Na ho ela na ho haingana dia tsy maintsy miresaka aminy izy.
However, we have to make it easy.	Na izany aza dia tsy maintsy manao izany mora foana izahay.
What he got.	Izay azony.
A house that has seen better days.	Trano iray izay nahita andro tsara kokoa.
You get nothing.	Tsy mahazo na inona na inona ianao.
You will still see him.	Mbola hahita azy ianao.
I'm not sure what he is.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe inona izy.
I think this story will help you become a better person.	Heveriko fa hanampy anao ho lasa olona tsara kokoa ity tantara ity.
He was very skilled.	Tena nahay izy.
I guess not you either.	Heveriko fa tsy ianao koa.
That's enough.	Tena ampy izay.
It’s like being afraid of something.	Toy ny hoe matahotra zavatra.
So why are you staying here?	Koa nahoana ianao no mijanona eto?
But, they have others.	Saingy, manana hafa izy ireo.
I have a picture.	Manana sary aho.
No, he decided.	Tsia, nanapa-kevitra izy.
That sounds good.	Toa tsara izany.
You don’t even need one.	Tsy mila iray akory ianao.
I see enough.	Hitako ampy.
I think it looks a little more !.	Heveriko fa toa kely kokoa izany!.
And that didn’t happen very often.	Ary tsy dia nitranga matetika izany.
Something like that.	Zavatra toy izany.
Well, the trip was good even if it was small.	Eny ary, dia tsara ilay dia na dia kely aza.
In fact, to me, this is the old story.	Raha ny marina, amiko dia io no tantara taloha.
I wondered if we understood?	Nanontany tena aho raha azony ve isika?
They went to see.	Nandeha hijery izy ireo.
However, it seemed to work for him.	Na izany aza, toa nety taminy izany.
I really like this one.	Tena tiako ity iray ity.
Who is the beautiful girl here?	Iza no tovovavy tsara tarehy eto?
I never enjoyed playing them.	Tsy nahafinaritra ahy mihitsy ny nilalao azy ireo.
What is this ?.	Inona ity?.
To his surprise, one day it came.	Gaga izy fa tonga indray andro.
We will stay here again if necessary.	Hijanona eto indray izahay raha ilaina.
We both love him so much.	Samy tia azy be izahay.
The news is nothing new.	Ny vaovao dia tsy misy vaovao.
That would be great.	Tena tsara raha izany.
We were there and did it.	Efa tany izahay ary nanao izany.
It’s easy enough for two.	Mora ampy ho an'ny roa izany.
That’s a really good thing.	Tena zavatra tsara izany.
Or he likes it.	Na tiany izany.
He could not speak for hours.	Tsy afaka niteny nandritra ny ora maro izy.
And it’s just fast.	Ary haingana ihany izany.
I can't think of that.	Tsy afaka mieritreritra an'izany aho.
I think you will like him very much.	Heveriko fa ho tianao be izy.
That could be bad news.	Mety ho vaovao ratsy izany.
We don’t talk anymore.	Tsy miresaka intsony izahay.
Now even they can’t get new people.	Ankehitriny na dia tsy afaka mahazo olona vaovao aza izy ireo.
I'm sure that's true.	Azoko antoka fa marina izany.
He doesn't talk to me like he used to.	Tsy toy ny taloha izy no miresaka amiko.
However, they went.	Na izany aza, nandeha izy ireo.
It didn't work very well.	Tsy dia nety loatra ilay izy.
It doesn’t seem to be much of a problem.	Toa tsy dia olana loatra.
And it just goes really fast.	Ary tonga dia mandeha haingana be.
It wasn't even a man.	Tsy lehilahy akory ilay izy.
This is very true.	Tena marina tokoa izany.
Only.	Ihany.
If he can.	Raha afaka izy.
I'm not even pretty right now.	Tsy tsara tarehy akory aho amin'izao fotoana izao.
It couldn’t be easier.	Tsy mora kokoa izany.
And then,	Ary avy eo,
People know where he is.	Fantatry ny olona ny toerana misy azy.
I will be there to help you if you need me.	Ho eo aho hanampy anao raha mila ahy ianao.
What will happen?	Inona no hitranga?
I'm not sure what's wrong here.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe inona no tsy mety eto.
Then it was done.	Dia vita izany.
No more than that.	Tsy mihoatra lavitra noho izany.
However, there is still one question for me.	Na izany aza, mbola misy fanontaniana iray ho ahy.
They have a lot of money, but not like us.	Manana vola be izy ireo, fa tsy toa antsika.
Because I’m not the only one.	Satria tsy izaho ihany.
So we went last week.	Dia nandeha izahay tamin'ny herinandro lasa.
We won’t talk about that anymore.	Tsy hiresaka izany intsony isika.
It's late.	Tara ny andro.
Maybe the rain is coming.	Angamba efa ho avy ny orana.
More than he knew about her.	Mihoatra noho izay fantany momba azy.
Once is enough.	Indray mandeha dia ampy.
I don't want to stay here.	Tsy te hijanona eto aho.
I don’t do that much.	Tsy dia manao izany loatra aho.
I personally see it.	Hitako manokana izany.
She is sick.	Marary izy.
There are books somewhere, perhaps.	Misy boky any ho any, angamba.
I don't like going there.	Tsy tiako ny mandeha any.
The other man did the same.	Toy izany koa ilay lehilahy hafa.
He is telling the truth.	Milaza ny marina izy.
I'll be there in an hour.	Ho any aho ao anatin'ny ora iray.
Then he looked at me.	Dia nijery ahy izy.
They drove all night and finally arrived.	Nandeha fiara nandritra ny alina izy ireo ary tonga ihany.
There may be a few trying to do that.	Mety misy vitsivitsy miezaka manao izany.
It started the other day.	Nanomboka ny andro hafa izany.
It must be too late.	Tsy maintsy ho tara be.
And don't worry about me.	Ary aza manahy momba ahy.
He really understood it.	Tena azony izany.
And that’s as far as I’ve gotten before.	Ary izany dia lavitra araka izay azoko teo aloha.
It certainly will be.	Azo antoka fa ho izany.
You talked to him about the earth.	Niresaka taminy momba ny tany ianao.
I don't see what could be the problem.	Tsy hitako izay mety ho olana.
But he was too late.	Saingy tara loatra izy.
I thought you should know.	Nieritreritra aho fa tokony ho fantatrao.
It will be more difficult.	Ho sarotra kokoa izany.
A very alive woman.	Vehivavy tena velona.
And it works well.	Ary miasa tsara izany.
Because we don’t exist.	Satria tsy misy isika.
The potential dangers are easy to identify.	Mora fantatra ny loza mety hitranga.
He sat down again.	Nipetraka indray izy.
He didn't want to look far.	Tsy te hijery lavitra izy.
He made it that way.	Izy no nanao azy ho toy izany.
To my surprise, he really liked it.	Gaga aho fa tena tiany ilay izy.
He knew he knew.	Fantany fa fantany.
I'm really sorry.	Tena miala tsiny aho.
He decided.	Nanapa-kevitra izy.
This is not a no for us.	Tsy tsia ho antsika izany.
I'm so glad he's happy.	Tena faly aho fa faly izy.
He knew he had to work fast.	Fantany fa tsy maintsy niasa haingana izy.
He wrote to me, and he wanted to see me.	Nanoratra ahy izy, ary te hahita ahy.
Wrong door, wrong way.	Diso varavarana, diso lalana.
Did he bring anything for you.	Nitondra zavatra ho anao ve izy.
You are crazy.	Adala ianao.
We have seen that.	Efa nahita an'izany izahay.
Work first is best.	Ny asa aloha no tsara indrindra.
It may be somewhere else he doesn’t know.	Mety ho toerana hafa tsy fantany.
He did not come.	Tsy tonga izy.
Very similar to this idea.	Tena mitovy amin'ity hevitra ity.
But they don’t have to be.	Saingy tsy voatery ho izy ireo.
If you’re the wrong person, it seems like too much work.	Raha olona diso ianao dia toa asa be loatra.
Then breakfast, and the meeting.	Avy eo ny sakafo maraina, ary ny fivoriana.
To me that seems too much.	Amiko toa be loatra izany.
I was too scared.	Natahotra loatra aho.
This is fun.	Ity no mahafinaritra.
She is very good.	Tena tsara izy.
We played and played and played.	Nilalao sy nilalao ary nilalao izahay.
And it’s not just a problem for men.	Ary tsy olana amin'ny lehilahy fotsiny izany.
I wanted something better.	Naniry zavatra tsara kokoa aho.
We are not very good at it.	Tsy dia mahay loatra izahay.
I don't understand it.	Tsy azoko ilay izy.
And we are the same.	Ary mitovy isika.
We are going.	Mandeha izahay.
They became afraid.	Lasa natahotra izy ireo.
It was a homeless place.	Toerana tsy nisy trano izy io.
It will never happen.	Tsy hitranga mihitsy.
I began to wonder when that would happen.	Nanomboka nanontany tena aho hoe rahoviana no hitranga izany.
They will not come well.	Tsy ho tonga tsara izy ireo.
He worked hard.	Niasa mafy izy.
I don’t know why, but it scared me.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana, fa natahotra ahy izany.
He is not a big man.	Tsy lehilahy lehibe izy.
I am a woman.	Vehivavy aho.
Then he had a clear idea.	Dia nanana hevitra mazava izy.
And then they just kind of sat down.	Ary avy eo dia somary nipetraka fotsiny izy ireo.
I thought he was a good man.	Nihevitra aho fa lehilahy tsara izy.
I have never met him.	Mbola tsy nihaona taminy aho.
He stole from me.	Nangalatra tamiko izy.
Lost opportunities.	Very ny fahafahana.
We really enjoyed it.	Tena nahafinaritra anay izany.
The first is as follows.	Ny voalohany dia toy izao manaraka izao.
One day it will be too much for you.	Indray andro dia ho be loatra aminao izany.
He may have a very good reason.	Mety manana antony tena tsara izy.
Maybe he’s too old.	Angamba efa lehibe loatra izy.
I was absolutely amazed when I got home and it was really fun.	Gaga tanteraka aho rehefa tonga tao an-trano ary tena nahafinaritra.
Where it comes from is unclear.	Avy aiza no tsy mazava.
People in stories are different.	Tsy mitovy ny olona ao amin'ny tantara.
Of course, the man was very stupid.	Mazava ho azy fa tena adala ilay lehilahy.
I will do no wrong.	Tsy hanao ratsy aho.
Never tell me what might happen.	Aza milaza amiko mihitsy ny mety hitranga.
She was glad to see him.	Faly izy nahita azy.
They are not girls.	Tsy tovovavy izy ireo.
Otherwise, water longer.	Raha tsy izany, rano lava kokoa.
It can really add a story.	Tena afaka manampy tantara iray.
You wonder if you see it.	Manontany tena ianao raha mahita azy io.
However, one thing.	Na izany aza, zavatra iray.
And there was none.	Ary tsy nisy izany.
They are not long.	Tsy ela izy ireo.
Here in this room.	Eto amin'ity efitrano ity.
It is the same house.	Dia io trano io ihany.
I was surprised.	Gaga aho.
I was the one who met the people.	Izaho no nihaona tamin'ny olona.
I’m glad to have you and the guys with us.	Faly aho manana anao sy ny lehilahy miaraka aminay.
It's too big.	Lehibe loatra ilay izy.
I'm used to water.	Efa zatra ny rano aho.
He knows he can’t do it, and you can do it.	Fantany fa tsy afaka manao izany izy, ary afaka manao izany ianao.
In fact, it would be fun.	Raha ny tena izy, dia ho mahafinaritra izany.
And if nothing is done.	Ary raha tsy misy azo atao.
I have to leave soon.	Tokony handeha tsy ho ela aho.
End of story.	Faran'ny tantara.
It is not easy for me to sleep.	Tsy mora amiko ny torimaso.
I looked at him.	Nijery azy aho.
They both have things.	Samy manana ny zavatra.
But he has something.	Saingy misy zavatra izy.
Making music is a job.	Asa ny fanaovana mozika.
Here, right now.	Teto, amin'izao fotoana izao.
Say what you like.	Lazao izay tianao.
You know that no one can sit down until you are already seated.	Fantatrao fa tsy misy afaka mipetraka raha tsy efa mipetraka ianao.
So is he.	Toy izany koa izy.
There are also.	Misy koa izy ireo.
If you’re looking for help, we’re not getting help.	Raha mijery ny fanampiana ianao dia tsy mahazo fanampiana izahay.
He did not wait.	Tsy niandry izy.
I had never lived in a house like this before.	Mbola tsy nipetraka tao an-trano toy izao aho taloha.
It's easy to do.	Mora ny manao izany.
Instead, we need to get here.	Mila tonga eto kosa isika.
I thought about it again.	Nieritreritra izany indray.
Not when he wasn’t working.	Tsy rehefa tsy niasa izy.
If not, that’s fine too.	Raha tsy izany dia tsara ihany koa.
You don’t know what they look like.	Tsy fantatrao hoe manao ahoana izy ireo.
He will go.	Handeha izy.
Tara is tara.	Tara dia tara.
At the moment, there is no work going on on that.	Amin'izao fotoana izao, tsy misy asa mandeha amin'izany.
He had to do that work.	Tsy maintsy nanao izany asa izany izy.
I may never see him again.	Mety tsy hahita azy intsony aho.
Of course.	Mazava loatra.
That should be the end of the story.	Tokony ho faran'ny tantara izany.
You said something this morning.	Nilaza zavatra ianao androany maraina.
These people are very happy.	Tena faly ireo olona ireo.
Maybe they have a problem, maybe not.	Angamba manana olana izy ireo, mety tsy.
We will never do that.	Tsy hanao izany mihitsy izahay.
He used to live in the house.	Nipetraka tao amin’ilay trano izy taloha.
He came out.	Nivoaka izy.
I can see again.	Afaka mahita indray aho.
We talked a lot over the years.	Niresaka be dia be izahay nandritra ny taona maro.
He may come right away.	Mety ho tonga avy hatrany izy.
Good luck.	Tsara ny vintana.
This is not an easy task.	Tsy asa mora izany.
The afternoon was pleasant.	Nahafinaritra ny tolakandro.
However, you may be right.	Na izany aza, mety ho marina ianao.
We are all here now.	Eto isika rehetra izao.
You do not.	Tsy manao izany ianao.
They arrived late and the meeting had already begun.	Tara vao tonga izy ireo ary efa nanomboka ny fivoriana.
You don’t want to get lost.	Tsy te ho very ianao.
I will really help you.	Tena hanampy anao aho.
I wonder if that’s good.	Manontany tena aho raha tsara izany.
The door was always there.	Teo foana ny varavarana.
Which still exists today.	Izay mbola misy ankehitriny.
Like, another year.	Toy ny hoe, taona hafa.
So, “no” is a bad word.	Noho izany, "tsy" dia teny ratsy.
I don’t know if we can do more.	Tsy fantatro raha afaka manao zavatra betsaka kokoa isika.
He left with a letter.	Lasa niaraka tamin’ny taratasy iray izy.
You know nothing.	Tsy misy fantatrao.
You have never been like that.	Mbola tsy toy izany mihitsy ianao.
I think you can’t just go watch.	Heveriko fa tsy afaka mandeha mijery fotsiny ianao.
I'm not waiting.	Tsy miandry aho.
For real.	Tena izy.
He can't get far.	Tsy afaka lavitra izy.
However, he did it anyway.	Na izany aza dia nataony ihany izany.
He works many hours a day.	Miasa ora maro isan'andro izy.
Everything was there.	Ny zava-drehetra teo.
The food was delicious.	Nahafinaritra ny sakafo.
You can’t just do one thing and not the other.	Tsy afaka manao zavatra iray fotsiny ianao fa tsy ny hafa.
And you know that’s true when you watch them die.	Ary fantatrao fa marina izany rehefa mijery azy ireo maty ianao.
That’s how it usually works.	Toy izany matetika no miasa.
It is not clear at all.	Tsy mazava mihitsy izany.
He is still asleep.	Mbola matory izy.
But you asked.	Fa nanontany ianao.
Even if you know it.	Na dia fantatrao aza izany.
This is not a letter to you.	Tsy taratasy ho anao izany.
I didn't need it.	Tsy nila izany aho.
You love me for you.	Tia ahy ho anao ianao.
It wasn’t real, it wasn’t there.	Tsy tena izy, tsy nisy izany.
A man and a man.	Lehilahy iray sy lehilahy iray.
We are not there yet.	Mbola tsy eo isika.
I really need you.	Tena mila anao aho.
And looked at the others.	Ary nijery ny hafa.
The main room is large.	Lehibe ny efitrano lehibe.
They did what they wanted.	Nanao izay tiany izy ireo.
i have seen it.	efa hitako io.
I was surprised.	Gaga aho.
The error is quite small.	Ny fahadisoana dia somary kely.
Finally.	Farany.
I’m full of anything.	Feno na inona na inona aho.
He knew what could happen.	Fantany izay mety hitranga.
There are a lot of us.	Be dia be izahay.
I had no idea.	Tsy nanana hevitra aho.
I am these two people.	Izaho no olona roa ireo.
You will know that.	Ho fantatrao izany.
Although the work is difficult, it really is.	Na dia sarotra aza ny asa, dia tena .
They make a lot of money.	Mahazo vola be izy ireo.
Some people say that women live longer than men.	Misy olona milaza fa ny vehivavy dia velona ela kokoa noho ny lehilahy.
It’s hard to be a little kid.	Sarotra ny hoe zaza kely.
Bad luck, bad luck.	Ratsy vintana, ratsy vintana.
It should say all that.	Tokony hilaza izany rehetra izany.
I just couldn’t do the job.	Tsy afaka nanao ilay asa fotsiny aho.
He wasn't sure he wanted to do it again.	Tsy azony antoka hoe te hanao izany intsony izy.
I hope you have a great time.	Manantena aho fa manana fotoana mahafinaritra ianao.
There was something wrong with that.	Nisy zavatra tsy nety tamin'izany.
And no one.	Ary tsy misy olona.
I really needed it.	Tena nila izany aho.
He is with me.	Miaraka amiko izy.
However, it is not.	Na izany aza, tsy izany.
Many people died.	Betsaka ny olona maty.
This is a big problem right now.	Olana lehibe izany amin'izao fotoana izao.
I really need it.	Tena mila izany aho.
I still don’t see why we couldn’t stay a little longer.	Mbola tsy hitako hoe nahoana izahay no tsy afaka nijanona kely.
He knows what to do.	Fantany izay tokony hatao.
He was lucky.	Tsara vintana izy.
I have a few questions.	Manana fanontaniana vitsivitsy aho.
I knew it was from him.	Fantatro fa avy aminy izy.
I don’t understand how that happened.	Tsy azoko hoe ahoana no nahatonga izany.
Don’t be too surprised.	Aza gaga loatra.
Of course, I wanted to stay there.	Mazava ho azy fa naniry ny hijanona tao aho.
It's been a long time.	Efa ela be.
And it’s no small thing.	Ary tsy zavatra kely izany.
Not far from him.	Tsy lavitra azy.
The last child left home last week.	Niala tao an-trano ilay zaza farany tamin’ny herinandro lasa teo.

There is also a lot of everyday life there.	Betsaka koa ny isan'andro any.

Yes, it is too late.	Eny, tara loatra izao.
Don’t be loud but rude.	Aza miteny mafy fa tsy mahalala fomba.
In fact, a woman reads.	Raha ny marina, vehivavy iray mamaky.
We can do it better than before.	Afaka manao izany ho tsara kokoa noho ny teo aloha isika.
This is a party for you.	Ity dia fety ho anao.
He did not intend to stay.	Tsy nikasa ny hijanona izy.
And she is beautiful.	Ary tsara tarehy izy.
The water is gone	Lasa ny rano

He is not very used to it.	Tsy dia zatra loatra izy.
I know how he was.	Fantatro hoe nanao ahoana izy.

He looked at her.	Nijery azy izy.
I could be wrong.	Mety ho diso aho.
That is why.	Izany no antony.
It hasn’t happened yet.	Mbola tsy nisy izany.
I have to read the book now !.	Tsy maintsy mamaky ny boky aho izao!.
If it stays there.	Raha mijanona eo izany.
I don’t think so.	Tsy mieritreritra aho hoe tsia.
Not from me.	Tsy avy amiko.
It follows him.	Manaraka azy izany.
It could be.	Mety ho.
We are wrong.	Diso izahay.

Now, perhaps, he might do it again.	Ankehitriny, angamba, mety hanao izany indray izy.
He sat there and thought about the past few days.	Nipetraka teo izy ary nieritreritra ny andro vitsivitsy lasa izay.
Otherwise, this is a very good book.	Raha tsy izany, ity dia boky tena tsara.
And he might be surprised.	Ary mety ho gaga ihany izy.
But if we do, we might say more about who doesn’t love him.	Fa raha manao izany isika dia mety hilaza bebe kokoa hoe iza no tsy tia azy.
Think alone.	Mieritreritra irery.
He likes it too.	Tiany koa izany.
It was a good thing.	Zavatra tsara ilay izy.
One day, another meeting.	Indray andro, fivoriana iray hafa.
I’m not buying the next book.	Tsy mividy ny boky manaraka aho.

I'm not scared.	Tsy matahotra aho.

You did not come.	Tsy tonga ianao.
Certainly it is possible.	Azo antoka fa azo atao izany.

I can't find it.	Tsy hitako ilay izy.

They are not like you.	Tsy mitovy aminao izy ireo.
I was in one place.	Teo amin'ny toerana iray aho.
It just can’t be for me.	Tsy mety ho ahy fotsiny izany.
You are a woman.	Vehivavy ianao.
I have to drive.	Tsy maintsy mitondra fiara aho.
Word will have to come out sooner or later.	Tsy maintsy hivoaka ny teny na ho ela na ho haingana.
It is very difficult to drive a car like that.	Tena sarotra ny mitondra fiara toy izany.
Maybe looking.	Mba mitady angamba.
That's what they were like then.	Izany no nisy azy ireo tamin’izany.
You have to move on to new types of foods.	Tsy maintsy miala amin'ny karazana sakafo vaovao ianao.
However, he understood it well.	Na izany aza, dia azony tsara.
We hope to help you !.	Manantena ny hanampy anao izahay!.
I'm not asking.	Tsy manontany aho.
He did more of himself.	Nanao bebe kokoa ny tenany izy.
It won’t be too bad.	Tsy ho ratsy loatra izany.
Lots of money.	Be dia be ny vola.
One knows better.	Ny iray no mahalala kokoa.
Of course, it has to.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy misy izany.
I know anywhere.	Mahay na aiza na aiza aho.
Although not much here.	Na dia tsy betsaka aza ny eto.
He felt more secure.	Nahatsiaro ho azo antoka kokoa izy.
He can't stop.	Tsy afaka mijanona izy.
She is beautiful.	Tsara tarehy izy.
At first everything seemed the same as before.	Tamin'ny voalohany dia toa toy ny teo aloha ihany ny zava-drehetra.
If they can’t, they’re different.	Raha tsy afaka izy ireo dia samy hafa karazana.
Like everything else about film, it takes time.	Tahaka ny zavatra hafa rehetra momba ny sarimihetsika, mila fotoana izany.
Not a tall man.	Tsy lehilahy lava.
She was happy, happy about it.	Faly izy, faly tamin’izany.
We have bad news.	Manana vaovao ratsy izahay.
Hope you win.	Manantena fa handresy ianao.
He was right, for once.	Marina ny azy, indray mandeha.
That's better.	Tsara kokoa izany.
They all get it.	Samy mahazo izany izy rehetra.
We can do all this.	Afaka manao izany rehetra izany isika.
And he has read it.	Ary efa namaky izany izy.
One of the most difficult as well.	Iray amin'ireo sarotra indrindra ihany koa.
He slept well.	Natory tsara izy.
I will definitely do them again.	Tena hanao azy ireo indray aho.
Here it is, like, another.	Eto dia, toy ny, hafa.
This is no small thing.	Tsy zavatra kely izany.
He went.	Nandeha izy.
I'll be back and we'll go.	Hiverina aho ary handeha isika.
If not, I have another idea.	Raha tsy izany dia manana hevitra iray hafa aho.
However, there was something else about the story.	Na izany aza, nisy zavatra hafa momba ny tantara.
I'm afraid he'll never get out of it.	Matahotra aho fa tsy hivoaka amin'izany mihitsy izy.
It's been a long time.	Ela be izao.
There will be no more.	Tsy hisy intsony.
This one in particular.	Ity iray ity indrindra.
I am not now.	Tsy izao aho.
Now for a little harder.	Ankehitriny ho an'ny kely sarotra.
Don’t be surprised anymore.	Aza gaga intsony.
You know these people.	Fantatrao ireo olona ireo.
Yes, you are very busy.	Eny, tena sahirana ianao.
I don't know.	Tsy fantatro.
And he looks at the letters.	Ary mijery ireo taratasy izy.
You believe they are, of course.	Mino ianao fa izy ireo, mazava ho azy.
I couldn’t begin to say where.	Tsy afaka nanomboka nilaza aho hoe taiza.
He didn’t do it well.	Tsy nanao izany tsara izy.
I see too much stuff.	Mahita zavatra loatra aho.
You can go now if you want.	Afaka mandeha ianao izao raha tianao.
Yes, just maybe.	Eny, angamba fotsiny.
Too strong, if any.	Mahery loatra, raha misy.
I didn't remember anything.	Tsy nahatsiaro na inona na inona aho.
Anyone can be one.	Na iza na iza dia afaka ny ho iray.
That is a good question.	Fanontaniana tsara izany.
They always do a good job.	Manao asa tsara foana izy ireo.
He knows us.	Mahafantatra antsika izy.
It has already done so.	Efa tany no nanao izany.
That's not right.	Tsy mety raha izany.
It’s three stories.	Tantara telo ilay izy.
You don’t even have to give them away.	Tsy voatery nanome azy ireo akory ianao.
We did not write comments.	Tsy nanoratra hevitra izahay.
No more.	Tsy misy intsony.
I will see you.	Hahita anao aho.
He thought the man could walk, and he didn’t.	Nihevitra izy fa afaka mandeha ny lehilahy, ary tsy nandeha.
But not all children are great at these stories.	Saingy tsy ny ankizy rehetra no lehibe amin'ireo tantara ireo.
You have to have an idea.	Tsy maintsy manana hevitra ianao.
Thank you, man.	Misaotra anao, lehilahy.
We talked for a long time.	Niresaka lava be izahay.
That will never happen, of course.	Tsy hitranga mihitsy izany, mazava ho azy.
He did it again.	Nanao izany indray izy.
You just have to know how to do it properly.	Tokony ho fantatrao fotsiny ny fomba hanaovana izany araka ny tokony ho izy.
In fact, this problem already exists.	Raha ny marina dia efa misy io olana io.
It’s like he’s more than that.	Toy ny hoe mihoatra noho izany izy.
He just didn’t seem to know how to play with kids.	Toa tsy nahay nilalao ankizy fotsiny izy.
He could play.	Afaka nilalao izy.
Where are we from ?.	Avy aiza isika?.
Someone loved me.	Nisy olona tia ahy.
I’m pretty sure it will happen.	Tena azoko antoka fa hitranga izany.
Then the man died.	Dia maty io lehilahy io.
It’s an everyday thing.	Zavatra isan'andro izany.
It is impossible to see anything.	Tsy azo atao ny mahita na inona na inona.
But yes, it is a real place.	Fa eny, toerana tena izy io.
We will definitely stay here again.	Tena hijanona eto indray izahay.
And they are free.	Ary afaka izany izy ireo.
This is the worst that can happen.	Izany no ratsy indrindra mety hitranga.
He was afraid of being identified.	Natahotra izy sao ho fantatra.
Don't do this.	Aza manao izao.
So, you swim to the top.	Noho izany, milomano any ambony ianao.
Let's do the work.	Aleo manao ny asa.
He hadn't thought of that yet.	Mbola tsy nieritreritra izany izy.
I can't stop.	Tsy afaka mijanona aho.
That.	Izany.
I would love to meet him.	Tiako ny hihaona aminy.
He won't do it to her.	Tsy hanao izany aminy izy.
In the future for us.	Amin'ny ho avy ho antsika.
Especially one and three.	Indrindra fa iray sy telo.
It was terrifying.	Natahotra mafy izany.
And now I’m a little sorry.	Ary ankehitriny miala tsiny kely aho.
The child did well.	Nanao tsara ilay zaza.
And he is good.	Ary tsara izy.
All three children were very good.	Tena nahay daholo ny ankizy telo.
You really have to go, man.	Tena tsy maintsy mandeha ianao, lehilahy.
No one left.	Tsy misy olona intsony.
He is not ready.	Tsy vonona izy.
Good for everyone.	Tsara ho an'ny rehetra.
You will find that opportunity.	Hahita izany fahafahana izany ianao.
It may not be good.	Mety tsy tsara izany.
It has to happen.	Tsy maintsy hitranga izany.
She is not a pretty girl.	Tsy tovovavy tsara tarehy izy.
You may never do that, and that’s fine.	Mety tsy hanao izany mihitsy ianao, ary tsara izany.
I was so happy to be able to help her.	Faly be aho fa afaka nanampy azy.
It hasn’t happened yet.	Mbola tsy nisy izany.
The children were nearby.	Teo akaiky teo ny ankizy.
And this is the best place.	Ary ity no toerana tsara indrindra.
We didn't see anything.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona izahay.
It’s very appropriate.	Tena mety izany.
Tell him the truth.	Lazao azy ny marina.
It was fun.	Nahafinaritra izany.
All the way.	Ny lalana rehetra.
One day, for sure.	Indray andro, azo antoka.
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.	Sao dia diso ny ataoko.
Something for everyone.	Zavatra ho an'ny rehetra.
There was a great deal of work to be done.	Nisy asa lehibe tokony hatao.
I am, in fact, not here or there.	Izaho, raha ny marina, tsy eto na any.
He told us that.	Izy no nilaza izany taminay.
She was happy about it.	Faly izy tamin’izany.
It’s like you’re in a picture book.	Toy ny ao anaty boky misy sary ianao.
I don’t think about the food.	Tsy mieritreritra ny sakafo aho.
It is impossible to know for sure.	Tsy azo atao ny mahafantatra na inona na inona azo antoka.
But this is not his last place.	Saingy tsy izany no toerana farany azy.
It came out a little.	Nivoaka kely.
I'm not sick.	Tsy marary aho.
Men should be themselves.	Ny lehilahy dia tokony ho ny tenany.
One minute later, the next one is gone.	Iray minitra teo, lasa ny manaraka.
There are a few who love both.	Misy vitsivitsy tia ny roa.
There are a lot of days like this.	Be dia be ny andro tahaka izao.
I started working.	Nanomboka niasa aho.
People swim, swim, and swim in the water.	Ny olona dia milomano, milomano, ary milomano ao anaty rano.
In any case, he thought no.	Na ahoana na ahoana, dia nieritreritra izy fa tsy.
Yes, a movie.	Eny, sarimihetsika iray.
The work should be impossible.	Ny asa dia tokony ho tsy azo atao.
It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona na inona.
It could be me.	Mety ho izaho izany.
You are right.	Marina ny hevitrao.
You need to help me.	Mila manampy ahy ianao.
This is not a good thing.	Tsy zavatra tsara izany.
It’s a person.	Olona iray izany.
I always waited for him to tell.	Niandry azy foana aho mba hilaza.
Even more so.	Mbola betsaka kokoa.
That’s what caused the problem.	Izany no nahatonga ny olana.
It's not too far away.	Tsy dia lavitra loatra izao.
He didn’t blame me but was angry.	Tsy nanome tsiny ahy izy fa tezitra.
They started working quickly.	Nanomboka niasa haingana izy ireo.
We get nothing now.	Tsy mahazo na inona na inona isika izao.
It’s fun.	Mahafinaritra ilay izy.
As soon as he decided on a room, he entered the room.	Raha vao nanapa-kevitra ny amin'ny efitrano iray izy dia niditra tao amin'ilay efitrano.
I will get something.	Hahazo zavatra aho.
He was not wrong.	Tsy diso izy.
It would be easy if they were.	Ho mora izany raha izy ireo.
We will not.	Tsy ho isika.
He is not.	Tsy izy.
He always went.	Nandeha foana izy.
One has to believe in oneself.	Tsy maintsy mino ny tenany ihany ny olona iray.
I don’t know what it is.	Tsy fantatro hoe inona izany.
This is completely wrong.	Diso tanteraka izany.
They are waiting for you upstairs.	Miandry anao any ambony izy ireo.
Long haul.	Dia lavitra.
Apparently they didn’t.	Toa tsy nanao izany izy ireo.
It's been two days.	Roa andro izao.
They didn’t have much.	Tsy nanana zavatra betsaka izy ireo.
I wanted more than that.	Naniry mihoatra noho izany aho.
Very good.	Tena tsara.
I did it myself.	Izaho mihitsy no nanao izany.
He made a face.	Nanao tarehy izy.
I knew that day would come.	Fantatro fa ho avy io andro io.
But that’s not all.	Saingy tsy izany ihany.
This is especially true for you.	Marina indrindra izany raha ny momba anao.
He had to work on it.	Tsy maintsy niasa tamin'izany izy.
He often arrived late.	Matetika izy no tara vao tonga.
There is nothing pleasant to me about it.	Tsy misy zavatra mahafinaritra amiko momba izany.
That’s too much for us.	Be loatra ho anay izany.
There are many of them now.	Maro izy ireo ankehitriny.
He doesn't have enough money.	Tsy ampy ny vola azony.
That's what happened.	Izay no nitranga.
He was a very good teacher.	Mpampianatra tena nahay izy.
This is not true at all.	Tsy marina mihitsy izany.
Surely he can still do that.	Azo antoka fa mbola afaka manao izany izy.
You told me you didn’t.	Nilaza tamiko ianao fa tsy nanao izany.
What time is it? 	Amin'ny firy izao?
They love to do it.	Tia manao izany izy ireo.
It’s like being at home.	Toy ny ao an-trano izany.
You're not ready yet girls.	Tsy mbola vonona ianao ry tovovavy.
I think it’s right here.	Heveriko fa eto mihitsy.
He couldn't do anything else.	Tsy afaka nanao zavatra hafa izy.
We are stronger than they are.	Mahery noho izy ireo isika.
I sat down again.	Nipetraka indray aho.
Everything is new and very challenging.	Vaovao ny zava-drehetra ary tena sarotra.
Yes, happy maybe.	Eny, faly angamba.
We could do nothing there.	Tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona izahay tany.
And it’s still here.	Ary mbola eto ihany.
You have to stay clear.	Tokony hijanona ho mazava ianao.
I love everything.	Tiako ny zava-drehetra.
Traveling long distances is difficult.	Sarotra ny dia lavitra.
It’s not that easy to see.	Tsy dia mora ny mahita izany.
And you should get every opportunity to be the best.	Ary tokony hahazo ny fahafahana rehetra ho amin'ny tsara indrindra ianao.
He will get there eventually.	Ho tonga any izy amin'ny farany.
He did it well.	Nanao izany tsara izy.
I only know about him.	Ny momba azy ihany no fantatro.
The girl stopped talking.	Tsy niteny intsony ilay tovovavy.
He wasted no time.	Nandany fotoana izy.
What you want to do.	Ny zavatra tianao hatao.
Something may happen to him and you have to look for him quickly.	Mety hisy zavatra hitranga aminy ka tsy maintsy mitady azy haingana ianao.
Not just today.	Tsy androany ihany.
I went too far.	Lasa lavitra aho.
He was at home.	Tao an-trano izy.
Tell me that again.	Lazao ahy indray izany.
Yours will leave.	Ny anao dia hiala.
He was compelled.	Voatery izy.
There is still more to be done.	Mbola misy zavatra hafa tokony hatao.
He was very surprised.	Tena gaga izy.
I'm looking for a lot.	Mitady betsaka aho.
He was happy to bring such a lucky letter.	Faly izy nitondra taratasy tsara vintana toy izany.
And you know it’s not a problem.	Ary fantatrao fa tsy olana izy.
It was good for him, for once.	Tsara izany taminy, indray mandeha.
We have to be perfect in that.	Tokony ho tanteraka isika amin’izany.
The problem is it’s hard to find them.	Ny olana dia sarotra ny nahita azy ireo.
Then the day went by quickly.	Dia nandeha haingana ny andro.
Now that opportunity is quickly being lost.	Ankehitriny dia very haingana izany fahafahana izany.
But this, this is different.	Fa ity, hafa ity.
He went back to a door.	Niverina teo amin'ny varavarana iray izy.
They are mine.	Ahy izy ireo.
I am new to this and really need help with this.	Vaovao amin'ity aho ary tena mila fanampiana amin'ity.
You are different than before.	Hafa noho ny teo aloha ianao.
It really helped.	Tena nanampy tokoa izany.
You can make a new image.	Afaka manao sary vaovao ianao.
They are not the problem.	Tsy izy ireo no olana.
I find all of this unbelievable.	Hitako fa tsy azo inoana izany rehetra izany.
I've never been like that before.	Mbola tsy toy izany mihitsy aho.
I don’t really think so.	Tsy dia mieritreritra an'izany aho.
Thanks for helping.	Misaotra nanampy.
Still to come.	Mbola ho avy.
It has never been like that before.	Mbola tsy nisy toy izany mihitsy.
At one point he stopped talking.	Tamin'ny fotoana iray dia nijanona tsy niteny izy.
He was with her when it happened.	Niaraka taminy izy rehefa nitranga izany.
Don't be angry.	Aza tezitra.
No more than that.	Tsy mihoatra noho izany.
Often very close.	Matetika tena akaiky.
This place may be small, but it’s fun.	Mety ho kely ity toerana ity, saingy mahafinaritra.
We’ve done that before.	Efa nanao izany izahay taloha.
The old car was running.	Nandeha ilay fiara taloha.
Not just me, but them too.	Tsy izaho ihany, fa izy ireo koa.
I really didn’t want to see them either.	Tena tsy te hahita azy ireo koa aho.
Any help would be great.	Ny fanampiana rehetra dia ho lehibe.
I had a job to do.	Nanana asa hatao aho.
It's a big house.	Trano lehibe io.
Everyone knows you are.	Fantatry ny rehetra fa ianao.
It's not like that.	Tsy mba toy izany.
And he stopped.	Dia nijanona izy.
We have to say we couldn’t have asked for anything better.	Tsy maintsy milaza izahay fa tsy afaka nangataka zavatra tsara kokoa.
It is never enough.	Tsy ampy mihitsy izany.
And they don’t get any bigger than that.	Ary tsy mahazo lehibe noho izany izy ireo.
I'm as good as you.	tsara toa anao aho.
Sorry that's true.	Miala tsiny fa izany no marina.
We will go again.	Handeha indray isika.
Helpful people.	Olona manampy.
He no longer knew what he was.	Tsy fantany intsony hoe inona izy.
We have been up to three.	Efa hatramin'ny telo izahay.
These men are busy all day.	Be atao mandritra ny andro ireo lehilahy ireo.
You can see a lot of them.	Afaka mahita azy ireo betsaka ianao.
It was as if no one lived here.	Toy ny hoe tsy nisy nipetraka teto.
With that, in.	Miaraka amin'izany, amin'ny.
They will go home.	Hody izy ireo.
Then they waited for another.	Dia niandry hafa indray izy ireo.
I really need to get there at some point.	Tena mila tonga any aho amin'ny fotoana iray.
Now he wants to go home.	Te hody izy izao.
Is it possible.	Mety hitranga ve izany.
He also did not know why.	Tsy fantany koa ny antony nahatonga izany.
I remember how it was.	Tadidiko hoe ahoana izany.
This man was not in the song.	Tsy io lehilahy io no tao amin'ilay hira.
He is always busy.	Be atao foana izy.
It’s really easy.	Tena mora tokoa izany.
Where it should have been.	Na taiza no tokony ho nisy azy.
Of course this is wrong.	Mazava ho azy fa diso izany.
They started early.	Nanomboka aloha izy ireo.
They couldn’t be more wrong.	Tsy mety diso kokoa izy ireo.
That seems to be the case now.	Toa izay no misy azy ankehitriny.
A lot of things happened.	Betsaka ny zavatra nitranga.
He didn’t want me to be that close.	Tsy tiany ho akaiky izany aho.
He brought more money with him.	Nitondra vola bebe kokoa niaraka taminy izy.
I'm speechless.	Very teny aho.
I was a little surprised.	Somary gaga aho.
I have already told them that.	Efa nolazaiko azy ireo izany.
Now, of course, maybe that could be better.	Ankehitriny, mazava ho azy, angamba mety ho tsara kokoa izany.
Or sleep.	Na torimaso.
And he said he was not alone.	Ary nilaza izy fa tsy izy irery.
It will be like that in the morning.	Ho toy izany ny maraina.
They are very strong swimmers.	Tena mahery milomano izy ireo.
Because he is not the only one.	Satria tsy izy ihany.
Talking of the night.	Miresaka ny alina.
It will be so to the end.	Dia ho toy izany hatramin'ny farany.
They were there now.	Teo izy ireo izao.
I was not expecting anything else.	Tsy nanantena zavatra hafa aho.
I just sat and looked interested.	Nipetraka fotsiny aho dia nijery liana.
No one should have told me anything.	Tsy nisy tokony nilaza tamiko na inona na inona.
And now it is complete.	Ary izao dia tanteraka.
Mine is already better.	Ny ahy efa tsara kokoa.
There is such a way.	Misy fomba toy izany.
It also seemed real.	Toa tena nisy ihany koa izany.
And you can't.	Ary tsy afaka.
I started thinking.	Nanomboka nieritreritra aho.
Then he left.	Dia lasa izy.
That’s right, with.	Marina izany, miaraka amin'ny.
And people are great.	Ary lehibe ny olona.

I need to find something else.	Mila mitady zavatra hafa aho.
The truth finally came out.	Nivoaka ihany ny marina.
He must have said so, for he began to talk to her.	Tsy maintsy ho nilaza izany izy, satria nanomboka niresaka taminy izy.
And very easy.	Ary tena mora.
It doesn’t work anywhere.	Tsy miasa na aiza na aiza.
The work is hard.	Mafy ny asa.

It’s hard.	Sarotra izany.
Surely that is a mistake.	Azo antoka fa diso tsara izany.

I might be lucky.	Mety ho tsara vintana aho.
This is especially true for people your age.	Marina indrindra izany ho an'ny olona mitovy taona aminao.
I never met him.	Tsy nihaona taminy mihitsy aho.

I can never.	Tsy afaka mihitsy aho.

Everyone else did.	Ny hafa rehetra nanao izany.
Now he knows it’s not.	Ankehitriny dia fantany fa tsy izany.
I want them to go home.	Tiako hody izy ireo.
The trip was more enjoyable.	Mahafinaritra kokoa ny dia.
So will you help us?	Ka hanampy anay ve ianao?
But no one is going to do that.	Saingy tsy misy olona hanao izany.
I am very happy and excited for her.	Tena faly sy faly ho azy aho.
Or from beginning to end.	Na hatramin’ny voalohany ka hatramin’ny farany.
I'm not in the right place.	Tsy eo amin'ny toerana tsara aho.
It didn’t help me.	Tsy nanampy ahy izany.
But I don't see it.	Nefa tsy hitako izany.
When it came back, it was empty.	Rehefa niverina ilay izy dia foana.
Then it happened.	Dia nitranga izany.
He doesn't go far.	Tsy mandeha lavitra izy.
I know he likes it.	Fantatro fa tiany ilay izy.
I have never seen anyone with him.	Tsy mbola nahita olona niaraka taminy.
Never try.	Aza miezaka mihitsy.
Who will come out on top ?.	Iza no hivoaka eo ambony?.
He just couldn’t say what it was.	Tsy afaka nilaza fotsiny izy hoe inona izany.
The water is really bad.	Tena ratsy ny rano.
He really didn’t get there anymore.	Tena tsy tonga teo intsony izy.
For good reason.	Noho ny antony tsara.
No photos needed.	Tsy mila sary.
What caused this tragedy?	Inona no nahatonga izao loza izao?
He does not speak.	Tsy miteny izy.
I had a problem.	Nisy olana tamiko.
Never do that.	Aza manao toy izany mihitsy.
Or he may not.	Na mety tsy hanao izany izy.
That's how it should be.	Izany no tokony ho izy.
He would not have wanted it.	Tsy ho naniry izany izy.
You can, you can absolutely do it.	Azonao atao, azonao atao tanteraka izany.
He would be just as happy, even happier, if it weren’t for that.	Ho faly toy izany koa izy, faly kokoa, raha tsy nisy izany.
He has done well.	Efa nanao tsara izy.
Everything is true.	Marina ny rehetra.
He is also a teacher.	Mpampianatra koa izy.
Then he thought about it for a few minutes.	Avy eo izy dia nieritreritra izany nandritra ny minitra vitsivitsy.
They could do nothing to him.	Tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona taminy izy ireo.
And how much is it.	Ary ohatrinona izany.
This book is not mine.	Tsy ahy io boky io.
Maybe that’s all you need to know.	Angamba io ihany no tokony ho fantatrao.
I doubt there are a lot of kids like you.	Misalasala aho raha be dia be ny ankizy toa anao.
He was skilled.	Nahay nahay izy.
This is no longer a problem.	Tsy olana intsony izany.
You read the first few questions.	Mamaky ny fanontaniana vitsivitsy voalohany ianao.

Who is the fastest?	Iza no haingana indrindra?
If he’s here, fine.	Raha eto izy dia tsara.
They were really fun.	Tena nahafinaritra izy ireo.
We are here to work.	Eto izahay hanao asa.
He may be busy.	Mety sahirana izy.
The best way is to do something about it.	Ny fomba tsara indrindra dia ny manao zavatra momba izany.
Me, this is me.	Izaho, izaho ity.
And bring clothes for him.	Ary mitondra akanjo ho azy.
They will do the same for you.	Hanao toy izany aminao koa izy ireo.
Better yet, you can always make your own.	Ny tsara kokoa dia azonao atao foana ny manao ny anao manokana.
There is a lot to do.	Betsaka ny tokony hatao.
He started to go home.	Nanomboka ho any an-trano izy.
The end is fast.	Haingana ny farany.
They went alone.	Nandeha irery izy ireo.

He desperately wanted to leave, but could not.	Naniry mafy ny hiala izy, saingy tsy afaka.
I don't see it.	Tsy hitako izany.
He sat down again.	Nipetraka indray izy.
They said they understood me.	Nilaza izy ireo fa azony aho.
He doesn’t like this thing.	Tsy tiany io zavatra io.
Yes, he is back.	Eny, niverina izy.
I saw something today.	Nahita zavatra aho androany.
He could no longer think.	Tsy afaka nieritreritra intsony izy.

I didn’t think anything else about it.	Tsy nieritreritra zavatra hafa momba izany aho.
Which was really fun.	Izay tena nahafinaritra.
But they often do, but not necessarily.	Saingy matetika izy ireo no manao izany, saingy tsy voatery.
And it’s easy to understand.	Ary mora azo izany.
Although not really.	Na dia tsy tena.
No one knows who did it and why.	Tsy misy mahalala hoe iza no nanao izany ary nahoana.
Is that so, yes.	Izany ve, eny.
For them, it is more than a nice word.	Ho azy ireo dia mihoatra lavitra noho ny teny mahafinaritra izany.
You can do anything.	Afaka manao na inona na inona ianao.

He was angry.	Tezitra izy.
We need more of everything.	Mila bebe kokoa amin'ny zava-drehetra isika.
I have to be very small.	Tsy maintsy ho kely dia kely aho.
That is why.	Izany no antony.
You are wrong here.	Diso ianao eto.
He wants to do whatever he wants, but with him.	Te hanao izay rehetra tiany hatao izy, fa miaraka aminy.
I am not a beautiful woman.	Tsy vehivavy tsara tarehy aho.
He was waiting for you to come home.	Niandry anao hody izy.
She decided to buy clothes.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hividy akanjo izy.
He is a dog.	Alika izy.
Within a few days,	Tao anatin'ny andro vitsivitsy,
He now walked the earth.	Nandeha tamin'ny tany izy izao.
I know you are busy.	Fantatro fa sahirana ianao.

Maybe more.	Mety ho bebe kokoa.
And something else.	Ary zavatra hafa.
And yes, he talks about the real problem.	Ary eny, miresaka momba ny tena olana izy.
I went to his room.	Nankany amin’ny efitranony aho.
If he didn't.	Raha tsy nanao izany izy.
I do both.	Samy manao aho.
Less than before.	Kely noho ny teo aloha.
He must be very worried.	Tsy maintsy manahy mafy izy.
It's the new year.	Taona vaovao izao.
The first thing the dog needs to do is walk.	Ny zavatra voalohany aloha dia mila mandeha ny alika.
He didn’t want to do the things he knew would help.	Tsy te hanao ireo zavatra fantany fa hanampy izy.

First, he had a problem.	Voalohany, nanana olana izy.
He did what needed to be done.	Nanao izay tokony hatao izy.
But he didn’t have it.	Saingy tsy nanana izany izy.
Is it possible?	Mety hitranga ve izany?
We just buy time.	Mividy fotoana fotsiny izahay.
You can do that one day.	Afaka manao izany ianao indray andro any.

I see it clearly.	Hitako tsara izany.
I said no, that's not right.	Izaho no niteny hoe tsia, tsy mety izany.
He knew it, even then, the first night.	Fantany izany, na dia tamin’izany aza, ny alina voalohany.
I understand what happened there.	Azoko ny zava-nitranga tany.
I would love to read your thoughts.	Tiako ny mamaky ny hevitrao.
He no longer knew what he could do.	Tsy fantany intsony izay azony atao.

She was afraid of her children.	Natahotra ny zanany izy.
Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of work to be done.	Aza diso hevitra fa betsaka ny asa tokony hatao.

I'm sure of that.	Azoko antoka izany.
It could be one of those things.	Mety ho ny iray amin'ireo zavatra ireo.

He had work to do.	Nanana asa tokony hatao izy.

For a minute or two.	Mandritra ny iray na roa minitra.

i'm just interested in what.	liana amin'ny inona fotsiny aho.
That seems plausible.	Toa azo inoana izany.
However, it is only so.	Na izany aza, dia izany ihany.

He could not do that.	Tsy afaka nanao izany izy.

So, really.	Noho izany, tena marina.
I’m just trying to follow through.	Miezaka manaraka fotsiny aho.

I did that often, in fact.	Nanao izany matetika aho, raha ny marina.
Sleep, of course.	Matory, mazava ho azy.
And it really is.	Ary tena izy.
She is very different from her children.	Tena hafa noho ny zanany izy.
We will never be sure.	Tsy hahazo antoka mihitsy isika.
In fact, we had no words.	Raha ny tena marina dia tsy nisy teny izahay.
The same day.	Ny andro iray ihany.
It’s like you haven’t seen him.	Toy ny hoe tsy nahita azy ianao.
He asked about the food, asked what.	Nanontany momba ny sakafo izy, nanontany hoe inona.
I am the danger.	Izaho no loza.
Indeed, I have done so before.	Eny tokoa, efa nanao izany taloha.
I am very happy.	Tena faly aho.
Every little thing.	Ny zavatra kely rehetra.
Why so many? 	Nahoana no betsaka?
Children have to study every day.	Tsy maintsy mianatra isan'andro ny ankizy.
You didn't.	Tsy nanao izany ianao.
No one knows where he is.	Tsy misy mahalala ny misy azy.
We will go ahead.	Ho any aloha isika.
I love him here now.	Tiako izy eto izao.
Everyone said so.	Samy nilaza izany ny rehetra.
We had been there for hours.	Efa ora maro izahay no tao.
And these are probably true.	Ary azo inoana fa marina ireo.
Don't go to sleep yet.	Aza mbola matory.
He does nothing.	Tsy manao na inona na inona izy.
Not here, not now.	Tsy eto, tsy izao.
It was as if it didn’t exist.	Toy ny hoe tsy nisy izany.
I think so.	Heveriko izany.
Things to do and not to do.	Zavatra tokony hatao sy tsy tokony hatao.

It went well.	Nandeha tsara izany.
He became very ill and lost his job.	Narary be loatra izy ary very asa.

And he was very sick.	Ary narary mafy izy.
Time will do what it has done for people.	Ny fotoana dia hanao izay nataony tamin'ny olona.
And it’s harder than you’d like.	Ary sarotra kokoa noho izay tianao.
Then, everything is known.	Avy eo, fantatra ny zava-drehetra.
This is not the case.	Tsy izany no izy.
Finally, there is the opportunity.	Farany, misy ny fahafahana.
This morning indeed.	Ity maraina ity tokoa.
He was never angry.	Tsy tezitra mihitsy izy.
I did the same.	Nanao toy izany koa aho.
He can’t be that anymore.	Tsy mety ho izany intsony izy.
They are beautiful people.	Olona tsara tarehy izy ireo.
Of course, he didn't want to help me.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy te hanampy ahy izy.
To bring you back to me.	Mba hitondra anao hiverina amiko.
I doubt it will be much different.	Misalasala aho na dia ho hafa be aza izany.

We didn’t get it.	Tsy nahazo izany izahay.
Lots of good books there.	Betsaka ny boky tsara any.

I would love to have one of these.	Tiako ny manana iray amin'ireo.

Now he needed to sleep.	Ankehitriny dia nila natory izy.
He doesn’t always do anything.	Tsy manao na inona na inona foana izy.
I talked to another one.	Niresaka iray hafa aho.
Something was missing here.	Nisy zavatra very teto.
We entered immediately.	Niditra avy hatrany izahay.
But he saw nothing of it.	Saingy tsy nahita na inona na inona momba izany izy.
I work hard.	Miasa mafy aho.
This will be true for many people of course.	Izany dia ho tanteraka ho an'ny olona maro mazava ho azy.
I don't understand at all.	Tsy azoko mihitsy.
I had a few.	Nanana vitsivitsy aho.
They tell me they love me.	Milaza amiko izy ireo fa tia ahy.

In a very big way.	Amin'ny fomba tena lehibe.
They are not working now.	Tsy miasa izy ireo izao.
And he will do it.	Dia hanao izany izy.
He looked at me.	Nijery ahy izy.
And he also stopped eating.	Ary tsy nihinana intsony koa izy.
And it could be.	Ary mety ho izany.
Even if it’s bad, even if it’s really bad.	Na dia ratsy aza izany, na dia tena ratsy aza.
They often went to bed early in the morning.	Matetika izy ireo no natory vao maraina.
You are very busy.	Tena sahirana ianao.
None worked well.	Tsy nisy niasa tsara.
You’re different, and that’s a good thing.	Hafa ianao, ary zavatra tsara izany.
No one did it.	Tsy nisy nahavita izany.
I have to leave again.	Tsy maintsy miala indray aho.
They are not in me.	Tsy ao amiko izy ireo.
I didn’t leave quickly.	Tsy niala haingana aho.
That might be good.	Mety ho tsara izany.
It’s you, isn’t it?	Ianao io, sa tsy izany?
For hours and hours.	Ho an'ny ora sy ora.
You can go there, or you can die here.	Afaka mandeha any ianao, na mety maty eto.
I had a similar problem.	Nanana olana mitovy amin'izany koa aho.
They have to work.	Tsy maintsy miasa izy ireo.
I never understood it.	Tsy azoko mihitsy ilay izy.
More people, more food, come naturally.	Betsaka ny olona, ​​sakafo bebe kokoa, tonga ho azy.
Maybe too much.	Be loatra angamba.
Angry about it.	Tezitra amin'izany .

It didn’t really happen to us.	Tsy tena nitranga taminay izany.
He never thought to do that.	Tsy nieritreritra ny hanao izany mihitsy izy.
Worried about making friends.	Manahy ny hahazo namana.
I'm glad you can come.	Faly aho fa afaka tonga ianao.

Time went on and on.	Nandeha sy nandeha ny fotoana.
They decided.	Nanapa-kevitra izy ireo.
He could not speak.	Tsy afaka niteny izy.
Another is that it’s fun to talk to him.	Ny iray hafa dia ny hoe mahafinaritra ny miresaka aminy.
I'm fine now.	Tsy maninona aho izao.
I've never seen that before.	Mbola tsy nahita an’izany mihitsy aho.
I made one.	Nanao iray aho.
This is not true.	Tsy marina izany.
Working or playing is all the same.	Ny miasa na ny milalao dia mitovy daholo.
And not many people do that.	Ary tsy maro ny olona manao izany.
This is not me.	Tsy izaho ity.
Or they thought they knew.	Na nihevitra izy ireo fa fantany.
That is the big problem.	Izany no olana lehibe.
He was never at home.	Tsy tao an-trano mihitsy.
Here I am, man.	Eto aho, lehilahy.
He knows the species well.	Fantany tsara ilay karazana.
But if he was here, he might just know.	Fa raha eto izy dia mety ho fantany ihany.
That's it now.	Izay izy izao.
If you don’t want to learn more about cars.	Raha tsy te hianatra bebe kokoa momba ny fiara ianao.
He had to think of something else.	Tsy maintsy nieritreritra zavatra hafa izy.
We are ready to go.	Efa vonona ny handeha izahay.
Not sure of anything.	Tsy azo antoka na inona na inona.
All of this is true.	Marina daholo izany rehetra izany.

I think of two now.	Mieritreritra roa aho izao.
Time for news.	Fotoana ho an'ny vaovao.

Well, it's back.	Eny ary, niverina io.
Do you know what.	Fantatrao ve hoe inona.
In place.	Amin'ny toerana.

Return to history.	Hiverina any amin'ny tantara.
I don’t know why he talked to me about it.	Tsy fantatro hoe nahoana izy no niresaka tamiko momba izany.
That never happened when mine arrived.	Tsy izany mihitsy no nitranga rehefa tonga ny ahy.

But there was a big problem with that.	Saingy nisy olana lehibe iray tamin'izany.
It can also go both ways.	Mety handeha amin'ny lalana roa ihany koa.
There were times when no one spoke.	Nisy fotoana tsy nisy niteny.
He knew something was wrong.	Fantany fa nisy zavatra tsy nety.

Everything he did was new.	Vaovao daholo izay nataony.
They worked hard and were lucky.	Niasa mafy izy ireo ary tsara vintana.
I don't think that's right.	Heveriko fa tsy mety izany.
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
She had the man.	Nanana ny lehilahy izy.
It was a great day.	Nahafinaritra ny andro.
He could have waited.	Mety ho afaka niandry izy.
He did nothing.	Nanao na inona na inona izy.
You can go anywhere.	Afaka mandeha na aiza na aiza.
We need to work harder.	Mila miasa mafy kokoa isika.
The music is really loud.	Tena mafy ny mozika.
It all seems to be gone now.	Toa lasa daholo izao.
On larger issues.	Amin'ny olana lehibe kokoa.
I think he did.	Heveriko fa nanao izany izy.
And of course, there are a few others like them.	Ary mazava ho azy, misy vitsivitsy hafa toa azy ireo.
They both had song ideas.	Samy nanana ny hevitra hira.
No problem, really.	Tsy misy olana, tena.
We have nothing left at the end of the month.	Tsy manana na inona na inona intsony isika amin'ny faran'ny volana.
He didn't need another girl.	Tsy nila tovovavy hafa izy.
Don't pretend he didn't.	Aza mody manao hoe tsy nanao izany izy.
Of course he wouldn't.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy hanao izany izy.
They are like children.	Toy ny ankizy izy ireo.
We decided to buy a house.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hividy trano izahay.
I can do it now.	Afaka manao izany aho izao.
I've been waiting a long time.	Efa ela aho no niandry.
Thus, the.	Araka izany, ny .
That was enough for the time being.	Ampy izany nandritra ny fotoana.
I was really scared.	Tena natahotra aho.
It’s harder to be with those who stay.	Sarotra kokoa ny miaraka amin'ireo mijanona.
Everything is in the right place.	Ao amin'ny toerana mety ny zava-drehetra.
I am the teacher.	Izaho no mpampianatra.
If it doesn’t go well, they leave.	Raha tsy mandeha tsara dia miala izy ireo.
We made real music.	Nanao mozika tena izy izahay.
He didn’t know what was going to happen.	Tsy fantany izay hitranga.
But no, it's not.	Saingy tsia, tsy izany.
I’m still working on that.	Mbola miasa amin'izany aho.
You know where it is.	Fantatrao ny misy azy.
I know this place.	Fantatro io toerana io.
I started reading.	Nanomboka namaky aho.
Not like now.	Tsy toy ny ankehitriny.
He can sleep while working.	Afaka matory izy rehefa miasa.
He must have a job to do.	Tsy maintsy manana asa hatao izy.
The week is completely over.	Vita tanteraka ny herinandro.
I was able to do that.	Afaka nanao izany aho.
That's all he will do.	Izay ihany no hataony.
There isn’t much in it.	Tsy dia misy firy ao.
There seem to be children everywhere.	Toa misy ankizy eny rehetra eny.
And if he gets it.	Ary raha azony izany.
But it’s not yours, you know.	Saingy tsy anao izy, fantatrao.
And he wanted more.	Ary naniry bebe kokoa koa izy.
However, there is something to it.	Na izany aza, misy zavatra iray amin'izany.
And he stopped.	Dia nijanona izy.
Once they slept without talking about food.	Indray mandeha izy ireo dia natory tsy niresaka momba ny sakafo.
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.
Good old stuff.	Zavatra taloha tsara.
It has to be the only time.	Tsy maintsy ho ny fotoana ihany.
They came right away.	Tonga avy hatrany izy ireo.
No one saw it.	Tsy nisy nahita izany.
One of you.	Ny iray aminao.
We are fine then.	Tsara isika raha izany.
He is gone.	Lasa izy.
He then went to school.	Nandeha nianatra izy avy eo.
Nothing, and never.	Tsy misy na inona na inona, ary na oviana na oviana.
It seems.	Dia toa.
But that’s about it.	Fa izay no momba izany.
We talked about a lot of issues.	Niresaka olana maro izahay.
Dead, in fact.	Maty, raha ny marina.
I know there is something else to it.	Fantatro fa misy zavatra hafa amin'izany.
He has gone too far to stay.	Lasa lavitra loatra izy ka tsy afaka mijanona.
Everyone will make way for you now.	Hanao lalana ho anao izao ny rehetra.
You may meet me.	Mety hihaona amiko ianao.
They eat everything.	Mihinana ny zava-drehetra izy ireo.
He immediately became someone else.	Tonga dia lasa olona hafa izy.
But there is a way.	Saingy misy fomba iray.
He was very pleasant at the time.	Tena nahafinaritra izy tamin'izany.
One of these many things is enough, it’s too much.	Ny iray amin'ireo zavatra maro ireo dia ampy, dia be loatra.
Either people need more time or they need more money.	Na mila fotoana bebe kokoa ny olona na mila vola bebe kokoa.
Both are great friends.	Samy namana be.
One will survive.	Ho velona ny iray.
It tried a different approach.	Nanandrana fomba hafa izy io.
He wanted it to be difficult.	Tiany ho sarotra izany.
He left a few days later.	Niala izy rehefa afaka andro vitsivitsy.
You are not beautiful.	Tsy tsara tarehy ianao.
I try to be a good person.	Miezaka ny ho olona tsara aho.
I think that's true.	Heveriko fa marina izany.
He got there.	Tonga teo izy.
It may be longer.	Mety ho lava kokoa izany.
He is gone.	Lasa izy.
He who does not have does not have the truth.	Izay tsy manana dia tsy manana ny marina.
Lots of sleep.	Be dia be ny matory.
You can work anywhere.	Afaka miasa na aiza na aiza ianao.
At the same time.	Mandritra izany fotoana izany.
I never understood why it should be like that.	Tsy azoko mihitsy hoe nahoana no tokony ho toy izany.
However, this is a mistake.	Na izany aza, fahadisoana izany.
Glad you didn’t do it, otherwise the trip might be lost.	Faly ianao fa tsy nanao izany, raha tsy izany dia mety ho very ilay dia.
I just couldn’t stop.	Tsy afaka nijanona fotsiny aho.
He still did it.	Mbola nanao izany ihany izy.
I will do anything for you.	Hanao na inona na inona ho anao aho.
You know you’re happy.	Fantatrao fa faly ianao.
He must be better than before.	Tsy maintsy ho tsara kokoa noho ny teo aloha izy.
That’s the story, though.	Izany no tantara, na izany aza.
But here you are.	Fa eto ianao.
We don’t care too much.	Tsy dia miraharaha loatra izahay.
It will never happen.	Tsy hitranga mihitsy izany.
I think he should be good.	Heveriko fa tokony ho tsara izy.
Far away again.	Lavitra indray.
He didn’t, you know.	Tsy nanao izany izy, fantatrao.
They seemed scared.	Toa natahotra izy ireo.
In fact, this is not entirely true.	Raha ny marina dia tsy marina tanteraka izany.
Maybe it would be good if you could.	Angamba mety ho tsara raha azonao atao.
I will see you.	Hahita anao aho.
You have to help me.	Tsy maintsy manampy ahy ianao.
So they all stayed where they were, for him.	Noho izany dia nijanona teo amin'ny nisy azy izy rehetra, ho azy.
I know he will say the same	Fantatro fa hilaza izany koa izy
This is not a bad thing.	Tsy hoe zavatra ratsy izany.
I know something that might help	Mahafantatra zavatra mety hanampy aho
Died young.	Maty mbola kely.
It is not.	Tsy izany.
I made sure he wouldn’t know	Nataoko antoka fa tsy ho fantany izy
And if people need it, fine.	Ary raha mila izany ny olona dia tsara.
It really suits me.	Tena mety amiko izany.
You need to have two out of three.	Mila manana roa amin'ny telo ianao.
Or there may be a vague idea.	Na mety misy hevitra tsy mazava.
This is what he really likes.	Ity no tena tiany.
And in the first year.	Ary tamin'ny taona voalohany.
I’m glad we got a dog	Faly aho fa nahazo alika izahay
I know the face well	Fantatro tsara ilay tarehy
I have to talk to you	Tsy maintsy miresaka aminao aho
Another bad idea.	Hevitra ratsy hafa.
To me the song is a song.	Amiko ny hira dia hira.
And they will know.	Ary ho fantany.
They are in him.	Ao aminy izy ireo.
Tell me what you know.	Lazao ahy izay fantatrao.
It’s like he’s going to do it.	Toy ny hoe hanao izany izy.
Yes, it is possible.	Eny, mety izany.
I will not do that to you	Tsy hanao toy izany aminao aho
It doesn’t matter to anyone.	Tsy maninona na iza izy io.
He may come home every day.	Mety hody izy isan'andro.
Yes, he likes it.	Eny, tiany izany.
And it doesn’t matter.	Ary tsy maninona izany.
I’m crazy to do that	Adala aho manao izany
You really need help	Tena mila fanampiana ianao
You can do it again.	Afaka manao izany indray ianao.
He was just a big kid.	Zaza be ihany izy.
And it will.	Ary hanao izany.
That’s good for me.	Tsara izany amiko.
I think it’s too special	Ataoko fa manokana loatra ilay izy
There was really something wrong with it.	Tena nisy zavatra tsy nety tao.
He didn't want me to go.	Tsy tiany handeha aho.
He will do nothing.	Tsy hanao na inona na inona izy.
I don't understand at all	Tsy azoko mihitsy
It is very difficult.	Tena sarotra be izany.
Which must be fun.	Izay tsy maintsy mahafinaritra.
However, they are very clear.	Na izany aza dia mazava tsara izy ireo.
He knows now.	Fantany izao.
I have to have friends somewhere	Tsy maintsy manana namana any ho any aho
I should have been scared.	Tokony natahotra aho.
I don't see why	Tsy hitako izay antony
They should do it right.	Tokony hanao izany tsara izy ireo.
I had never looked like that before	Mbola tsy nijery toy izany mihitsy aho taloha
It’s definitely done.	Vita tanteraka tokoa izany.
It's a month late.	Tara iray volana izao.
These are nowhere to be found.	Tsy misy na aiza na aiza ireo.
I am willing to do it	Vonona ny hanao izany aho
Sleep with him.	Matory miaraka aminy.
That’s fine right now.	Tsara izany amin'izao fotoana izao.
I could be here anywhere.	Mety ho eto aho na aiza na aiza.
I know all about him	Fantatro daholo ny momba azy
They saw nothing.	Tsy nahita na inona na inona izy ireo.
No, he didn't.	Tsia, tsy nanao izany izy.
I knew he was a real person	Fantatro fa tena olona izy
I was ready when he called	Izaho indray dia efa vonona rehefa niantso izy
I really don’t yet.	Tena mbola tsy manao aho.
He wanted to go, and he wanted to stay again.	Te handeha izy, ary te hijanona indray.
No one told me that all women are strong.	Tsy nisy nilaza tamiko fa mahery ny vehivavy rehetra.
But tomorrow really never comes.	Fa rahampitso tena tsy tonga mihitsy.
And they got land too.	Ary nahazo tany koa izy ireo.
I hope he sees it wherever he is	Manantena aho fa mahita izany izy na aiza na aiza misy azy
He was still there.	Teo ihany izy.
I still don’t know about them	Mbola tsy haiko ny momba azy ireo
I didn't see him come.	Tsy nahita azy tonga aho.
The exterior is very simple.	Ny ivelany dia tena mora.
He will go far.	Ho lasa lavitra izy.
I will be alone.	Ho irery aho.
We will go.	Handeha isika.
It’s hard for me, but it’s necessary.	Sarotra amiko izany, saingy ilaina izany.
It has gone too far.	Lasa lavitra loatra izany.
Lots of problems.	Olana be dia be.
I'm really worried about him	Manahy mafy azy aho
I'm so glad to see you beautiful	Tena faly aho mahita anao tsara tarehy
I had a bad age like you once	Nanana taona ratsy toa anao koa aho indray mandeha
And he needs and loves you.	Ary mila sy tia anao izy.
I would never be free without it	Tsy ho afaka mihitsy aho raha tsy izany
It could be you too.	Mety ho anao koa izany.
I will not be angry	Tsy ho tezitra aho
Kids as fast as you can.	Haingana araka izay azonao atao ny ankizy.
I read it once in a book	Namaky azy io indray mandeha aho tao anaty boky
I think, sit here.	Ny heveriko, mipetraka eto.
It will be a player.	Ho mpilalao izy io.
He said it was just luck.	Nilaza izy fa vintana fotsiny izany.
Whether good or bad.	Na tsara na ratsy.
I like the clothes on you	Tiako ny akanjo eo aminao
However, they have it all.	Na izany aza dia manana ny zava-drehetra izy ireo.
I guess he never talked to me	Ataoko fa tsy niresaka ahy mihitsy izy
But the room was not very nice.	Saingy tsy dia tsara loatra ilay efitrano.
Usually you don’t need to do anything.	Matetika dia tsy mila manao na inona na inona ianao.
She has really loved him ever since.	Tena tia azy tanteraka izy nanomboka teo.
Otherwise, the place dies.	Raha tsy izany dia maty ilay toerana.
You love those that look like that.	Tianao ireo izay toa izany.
Only you.	Ianao ihany.
Whoever said that is more than right.	Na iza na iza nilaza izany dia mihoatra noho ny marina.
That's all it is.	Izany ihany no izy.
I wish he hadn’t asked	Naniry aho fa tsy nanontany izy
I found something about him	Nahita zavatra momba azy aho
Two by two.	Roa amin'ny roa.
I need to find something	Mila mahita zavatra aho
We need it.	Mila izany isika.
I hope he doesn’t go crazy today	Manantena aho fa tsy hiverina ho adala izy androany
Both for the same reason.	Samy noho ny antony iray ihany.
There was still something else he had to do.	Mbola nisy zavatra hafa tokony hataony.
I just need to follow him	Mila manaraka azy fotsiny aho
In fact, the tragedy is still alive.	Raha ny marina dia mbola velona tokoa ilay loza.
But you really need to be with us.	Fa tena mila miaraka aminay ianao.
Or about anything else about it.	Na momba ny zavatra hafa momba izany.
You and I, we are the same.	Izaho sy ianao, mitovy ihany isika.
I don’t want that to happen	Tsy tiako ho tanteraka izany
I'm interested but that's all	Mba liana ihany aho fa izay ihany
I know he's not.	Fantatro fa tsy izy.
I don't remember anything	Tsy tadidiko na inona na inona
I am a good man.	Lehilahy tsara aho.
He is very much alive	Tena velona izy
They said you two really went through it.	Nilaza izy ireo fa tena nandeha tamin'izany ianareo roa.
He just loves it.	Tiany fotsiny izany.
Time to make history.	Fotoana hanaovana tantara.
Is it the same.	Mitovy ve.
I talked to him	Niresaka taminy aho
I thought he was lucky	Noheveriko fa tsara vintana izy
Very convenient.	Tena mety.
Far from here.	Lavitra eto.
And of course, when they did, the baby was fine.	Ary mazava ho azy, rehefa nanao izany izy ireo, dia tsara ilay zaza.
I didn’t think it was going to happen	Tsy noheveriko fa hitranga izany
He is back.	Efa niverina izy.
And in any case, it didn’t go well.	Ary na ahoana na ahoana, tsy nety tsara ilay izy.
People will come to see.	Ho avy ny olona hijery.
I’m glad we stayed	Faly aho fa nijanona izahay
That’s a lot.	Tena betsaka izany.
I want to talk about you	Te hiresaka momba anao aho
Something went wrong here	Zavatra tsy mety nisy teto
He loves girls, girls, girls.	Tiany ny tovovavy, tovovavy, tovovavy.
Man, this thing is bad.	Ry lehilahy, ratsy ity zavatra ity.
They are too long, or too big.	Lava loatra izy ireo, na lehibe loatra.
As he did.	Toy ny nataony.
I thought it would be easy	Nihevitra aho fa ho mora izany
Also, it’s hard for you.	Ary koa, sarotra aminao izany.
I have always said that.	Efa nilaza izany foana aho.
I hope you know that	Manantena aho fa fantatrao izany
No, we don’t care.	Tsia, tsy miraharaha izahay.
If you know one, please tell me.	Raha fantatrao ny iray dia lazao ahy azafady.
I learn fast.	Mianatra haingana aho.
I would.	Izaho dia.
I don’t know when I will stop	Tsy fantatro hoe rahoviana aho no hijanona
First and foremost it must be safe, accurate and reliable.	Voalohany indrindra dia tsy maintsy azo antoka, marina ary azo antoka.
I think we are not the same	Heveriko fa tsy mitovy isika
I hope this helped you.	Manantena aho fa nanampy anao izany.
But it never works.	Saingy tsy miasa mihitsy izany.
However.	Na tsy izany aza.
Many have left.	Maro no efa niala.
And the time has come.	Ary tonga ny fotoana.
I saw him once.	Indray mandeha aho no nahita azy.
He is not wrong.	Tsy diso lalana izy.
I didn't even see him waiting there	Tsy hitako akory izy niandry teo
I had to get a little letter	Tsy maintsy nahazo taratasy kely aho
Thanks, but no.	Misaotra, fa tsia.
He wanted to see it again.	Naniry hijery izany indray izy.
In the same thing.	Amin'ny zavatra mitovy.
He knows exactly what to do.	Fantany tsara izay tokony hatao.
I really don’t want to see him	Tena tsy te hahita azy aho
And thank you for coming.	Ary misaotra anao tonga.
I really thought he was dead.	Tena noheveriko fa maty izy.
I'm really sorry but not really	Tena miala tsiny aho fa tsy tena
I wonder if they do that now.	Manontany tena aho raha manao izany izy ireo amin'izao fotoana izao.
I saw the police there	Hitako teo ny polisy
I can read good people	Afaka mamaky olona tsara aho
I’m happy to say that we almost completely agree.	Faly aho milaza fa saika mitovy hevitra tanteraka isika.
I'm not sure yet.	Tsy mbola azoko antoka.
It’s only one thing.	Zavatra iray ihany izany.
The room was quite nice, albeit small.	Somary tsara ilay efitrano, na kely aza.
I know it may never happen again	Fantatro fa mety tsy hitranga intsony izany
I really needed information about him	Tena nila vaovao momba azy aho
I need to know more.	Mila mahafantatra bebe kokoa aho.
He must have been very scared.	Mety ho natahotra be izy.
By the way.	Fa momba izay ihany.
I was so wrong	Tena diso aho
I can tell right away what's inside someone.	Afaka milaza avy hatrany izay ao anatin’ny olona iray aho.
He is the best !.	Izy no tsara indrindra!.
I will be here	Ho eto aho
He alone.	Izy irery ihany.
And it’s not clear.	Ary tsy mazava izany.
It doesn't matter.	Tsy maninona izany.
It was really fun	Tena nahafinaritra izany
I haven't seen it yet.	Tsy mbola nahita aho.
I also love books.	Izaho koa dia tia boky.
I really had a great time, thank you	Tena nanana fotoana mahafinaritra aho, misaotra anao
I will definitely do it	Tena hanao izany aho
But he tried another idea.	Saingy nanandrana hevitra iray hafa izy.
I work hard.	Manao mafy aho.
I thought it was all gone	Nihevitra aho fa lasa daholo ny rehetra
That’s a good thing for me.	Zavatra tsara ho ahy izany.
I thought it was still the same as the actor	Noheveriko fa mbola mitovy amin'ilay mpilalao sarimihetsika ihany ilay izy
I think it works.	Heveriko fa miasa izany.
I always like to work at night	Tiako foana ny miasa alina
There is a car waiting for you.	Misy fiara miandry anao.
It seems like a very real thing.	Toa zavatra tena misy tokoa izany.
They should know.	Tokony ho fantany.
I have never heard anyone speak completely differently	Tsy mbola nandre olona miteny hafa tanteraka aho
I don’t think he even knew it.	Heveriko fa tsy fantany akory izany.
It’s really fun to watch.	Tena mahafinaritra ny mijery azy.
I doubt it will ever happen.	Misalasala aho fa mbola hisy izany.
I talked too fast and too long	Niresaka haingana sy lava loatra aho
In fact, we have two, in fact.	Raha ny marina, manana roa izahay, raha ny marina.
Because of the baby, he had to go.	Noho ilay zaza dia tsy maintsy nandeha izy.
He was nowhere to be found in the room.	Tsy nisy na taiza na taiza tao amin’ilay efitrano koa izy.
They say that and everything.	Milaza izany sy ny zavatra rehetra izy ireo.
I don’t know who started it	Tsy fantatro hoe iza no nanomboka izany
I wondered if it would stop	Nanontany tena aho raha hijanona izany
They had to wait for the water.	Tsy maintsy niandry ny rano izy ireo.
I wonder where we are	Manontany tena aho hoe aiza isika
I know everything.	Fantatro ny zava-drehetra.
Maybe that would help.	Angamba mety hanampy izany.
I got back in the car	Niverina teo amin’ilay fiara aho
I always thought of you	Nieritreritra anao foana aho
It may come next summer.	Mety ho tonga amin'ny fahavaratra manaraka.
I have never met him.	Mbola tsy nihaona taminy aho.
I spoke to him this afternoon	Niresaka taminy aho androany tolakandro
Any help is great.	Tena mahafinaritra ny fanampiana rehetra.
You may have heard of it.	Mety efa nandre momba izany ianao.
I might be known.	Mety ho fantatra aho.
But the question remained.	Saingy nijanona ny fanontaniana.
This is new to me.	Vaovao amiko izany.
I don't think so.	Heveriko fa tsy izy.
But it doesn't matter.	Fa tsy maninona.
i just know where you are	fantatro fotsiny hoe aiza ianao
All women do that.	Ny vehivavy rehetra dia manao izany.
And it has to be so here.	Ary tsy maintsy ho toy izany eto.
Of course, this is not a completely new idea.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy hevitra vaovao tanteraka izany.
I didn't even see you	Tsy nahita anao akory aho
I know where it is	Fantatro hoe taiza io
I really enjoyed being with him	Tena tiako ny niaraka taminy
I’m pretty sure it can’t	Saika azoko antoka fa tsy afaka izany
Still not talking.	Mbola tsy miresaka.
I could say a lot, even worse	Afaka nilaza zavatra betsaka aho, mbola ratsy kokoa aza
The car is very special.	Tena manokana ny fiara.
I should have just stayed there	Tokony ho nijanona teo fotsiny aho
I want it done.	Tiako ho vita izany.
I think we are on the right track now	Heveriko fa eo amin'ny lalana marina isika izao
No one needs you here.	Tsy misy mila anao eto.
I don't want to say that either.	Tsy te hilaza an’izany koa aho.
I wonder if you will help me with something.	Manontany tena aho raha hanampy ahy amin'ny zavatra iray ianao.
I tried to talk to him.	Niezaka niresaka taminy aho.
Only to me.	Amiko ihany.
I stayed	Nijanona aho
I know it takes time	Fantatro fa mila fotoana izany
I think that might help.	Heveriko fa mety hanampy izany.
I don't know the car	Tsy fantatro ilay fiara
Then it was done.	Dia vita izany.
I just didn’t enter for no reason.	Tsy niditra tsy nisy antony fotsiny aho.
It’s exactly the same.	Mitovy tanteraka izany.
He wasn't sure what to do next.	Tsy azony antoka izay hataony manaraka.
I'm not.	Tsy izany aho.
I'm not sure what to do now	Tsy azoko antoka izay tokony hatao izao
But it’s still the same.	Saingy mbola izany ihany.
That’s really good.	Tena tsara tokoa izany.
Currently in his first year.	Amin'izao fotoana izao amin'ny taona voalohany.
That’s a good thing.	Zavatra tsara izany.
Maybe he had already learned that.	Angamba efa nianatra izany izy.
I think it was a man	Heveriko fa lehilahy ilay izy
If possible.	Raha azo atao.
Another time and he paused for a moment.	Fotoana iray hafa ary nijanona kely izy.
I don't like it now	Tsy tiako izao
He had to come back again.	Tsy maintsy niverina indray izy.
There is something wrong with it.	Misy zavatra tsy mety ao.
No one died but history did the paperwork.	Tsy nisy maty fa ny tantara no nanao ny taratasy.
No, they can't.	Tsia, tsy afaka izy ireo.
I saw that they were no longer there	Hitako fa tsy tao intsony izy ireo
I really got out of here.	Tena niala teto aho.
Everything is new.	Vaovao ny zava-drehetra.
We are in place.	Ao amin'ny toerana izahay.
You may know that too.	Mety ho fantatrao koa izany.
Yes, it will be known in a difficult way.	Eny, ho fantatra amin'ny fomba sarotra izany.
I really like this guy	Tena tiako io lehilahy io
They are not like that.	Tsy toy izany izy ireo.
I don’t care about anything else	Tsy miraharaha zavatra hafa aho
Mine doesn't have that.	Ny ahy tsy manana an'izany.
It seems true to me.	Toa marina amiko.
I tried everything, even drank a lot when I read it	Nanandrana ny zava-drehetra aho, na dia nisotro be aza rehefa namaky azy io
I could be wrong.	Mety ho diso aho.
I used to be him and soon he will be for me.	Izaho dia izy taloha ary tsy ho ela dia ho ahy izy.
This does not seem to have happened.	Toa tsy izany no nitranga.
It's just a song.	Hira fotsiny io.
It is a very difficult book	Boky sarotra be ilay izy
I have to tell the police about it.	Tsy maintsy milaza amin’ny polisy momba izany aho.
It can't be.	Tsy mety ho izany.

It was a difficult day for him.	Nisy andro sarotra ho azy.
I have to know what you really are	Tsy maintsy fantatro hoe inona marina ianao

You're good.	Mahay ianao.
I know you are, of course you are	Fantatro fa ianao, mazava ho azy fa ianao
A few students asked him about it	Nisy mpianatra vitsivitsy nanontany azy momba izany
And he knew something else.	Ary fantany zavatra hafa koa.
He likes it too.	Tiany koa izany.
If he asks, he refuses again.	Raha manontany izy dia tsy nety indray izy.

It does many other things as well.	Manao zavatra maro hafa koa izy io.
There has been good and bad.	Efa nisy ny tsara sy ny ratsy.
And it happened.	Ary nitranga izany.
I can't thank them enough	Tsy afaka misaotra azy ireo aho

I really wanted to do something completely different.	Tena naniry hanao zavatra hafa tanteraka aho.
He did not look at them.	Tsy nijery azy ireo izy.
We could do nothing.	Tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona izahay.
I stopped eating it.	Tsy nihinana azy intsony aho.
I don’t hesitate even for a minute.	Tsy misalasala aho na dia iray minitra aza.

I told him you were coming	Nolazaiko taminy fa ho avy ianao
It's been a long time coming.	Efa ela no tonga.
I may not come to you	Mety tsy ho tonga any aminao aho
They stopped immediately.	Nijanona teo no ho eo izy ireo.
Didn't hear anything from the house.	Tsy nandre na inona na inona avy tao an-trano.
He just said he saw you a lot.	Nilaza fotsiny izy fa nahita anao betsaka.

No idea at all.	Tsy misy hevitra mihitsy.
I had nothing	Tsy nanana na inona na inona aho
I thought it was more than the above	Nihevitra aho fa mihoatra ny ambony
I made sure that everything was going well in the house	Nataoko azo antoka fa mandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra tao amin'ilay trano
They can do anything.	Mety hanao na inona na inona izy ireo.
I read them too.	Namaky azy ireo koa aho.
I have a little work to do tonight	Misy asa kely hataoko anio alina
He did his best.	Nanao ny tsara indrindra izy.
Then he left again.	Dia lasa indray izy.
I see what can be done	Hitako izay azo atao
And now it is too late.	Ary izao dia tara loatra.
I am waiting for the right time.	Miandry ny fotoana mety indrindra aho.
I needed to talk about it	Nila niresaka momba azy aho
You are one, two, three.	Iray, roa, telo ianareo.
Now there was.	Ankehitriny dia nisy.
It doesn’t matter that it’s not true.	Tsy maninona fa tsy marina izany.
Instead, they bought it.	Nividy azy kosa izy ireo.
I don't quite understand what happened	Tsy azoko tsara ny zava-nitranga
I had never seen a man like him before	Mbola tsy nahita lehilahy toa azy aho taloha
I had to work hard for that	Tsy maintsy niasa mafy ho amin’izany aho
He went back into the room.	Niverina niditra tao amin’ilay efitrano izy.
I always want to be with him	Te hiaraka aminy foana aho
I know he loves me	Fantatro fa tia ahy izy
Saw you today.	Nahita anao androany.
I really want to get out.	Tena te hivoaka aho.
I never bought it for that reason.	Tsy nividy izany antony izany mihitsy aho.
They may be too busy.	Be atao loatra angamba izy ireo.
I don't understand that.	Tsy azoko izany.
We didn’t just tell you.	Tsy nilaza taminao fotsiny izahay.
You are not like that, you are not like that.	Tsy toy izany koa ianao, tsy toy izany.
I think by the end of the year	Heveriko fa amin'ny faran'ny taona
Didn't eat.	Tsy nihinana.
I think these are true	Heveriko fa marina ireo
He looked at us staring.	Nijery anay nijery izy.

Close, but not really.	Akaiky, fa tsy tena.
I don’t care about anything.	Tsy miraharaha na inona na inona aho.
After waiting for months, it finally came.	Rehefa niandry volana maro be dia tonga ihany ilay izy.
I didn’t even know it existed.	Tsy fantatro akory hoe misy izy io.
It just seems like a good idea.	Toa hevitra tsara fotsiny.
Either you die because of it, or you go crazy.	Na maty noho izany ianao, na lasa adala.

We could have done more.	Afaka nanao bebe kokoa izahay.

I didn’t just tell you	Tsy nilaza taminao fotsiny aho
I don’t even remember what it was	Tsy tadidiko mihitsy hoe inona izany
Will not return here.	Tsy hiverina eto.
He is now.	Izy izao.
Especially the latter.	Indrindra fa ilay farany.
I’m not saying it’s okay or not.	Tsy izaho no miteny hoe mety io na tsia.
You know what will happen.	Fantatrao izay hitranga.
I was the one who thought well	Izaho no nieritreritra tsara
We share a lot of stories.	Mitovy tantara be dia be izahay.
Must have it again today.	Tsy maintsy manana izany indray androany.
I needed to say something	Nila nilaza zavatra aho

I'm sorry I'm a little late	Miala tsiny aho fa tara kely
I haven't told anyone yet.	Mbola tsy nilaza na iza na iza.
No one has the opportunity to do that at all.	Tsy misy olona manana fahafahana hanao izany mihitsy.
We didn’t talk about it.	Tsy niresaka momba izany izahay.
There is no place for us here anymore.	Tsy misy toerana ho antsika intsony eto.
Maybe the child was telling the truth.	Angamba nilaza ny marina ilay zaza.
I don't know where the door is	Tsy haiko hoe aiza ny varavarana
I’m not sure what, but it really was.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe inona, fa tena nisy ilay izy.
And the food.	Ary ny sakafo.
This is not an easy task.	Tsy asa mora izany.
Yes, many things.	Eny, zavatra maro.
I know someone who can help	Mahafantatra olona afaka manampy aho

A little bit, but still good	Kely kely, nefa mbola tsara
I think he really likes it here.	Heveriko fa tena tiany izany eto.
Because he told me.	Satria nilaza tamiko izy.
I don’t see what could be different right now	Tsy hitako izay mety ho hafa amin'izao fotoana izao
I know you can't go far	Fantatro fa tsy afaka lasa lavitra ianao
It’s one of those.	Iray amin'ireo izany.
I couldn't do anything.	Tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona aho.
I could easily see the other years working there.	Hitako mora foana ny taona hafa niasa tao.
I never understood that	Tsy azoko mihitsy izany
It's a wonderful place.	Toerana mahafinaritra io.
This news is new.	Vaovao ity vaovao ity.
I really like the idea	Tena tiako ilay hevitra
There was something wrong with all of that.	Nisy zavatra tsy nety tamin'izany rehetra izany.
He may be on something, he may not.	Mety ho eo amin'ny zavatra iray izy, mety tsy.
That is true.	Marina izany.
Only stupid people do that.	Olona adala ihany no manao izany.
He wanted me to stay there.	Tiany hijanona tao aho.
I could see that he was scared	Hitako fa natahotra izy
A time or two.	Fotoana iray na roa.
I did a lot yesterday	Be dia be ny nataoko omaly
Don’t worry about it.	Aza manahy momba azy.
We really are.	Tena isika.
If you know anything, tell me.	Raha mahalala zavatra ianao dia lazao amiko.
I had nothing at all then.	Tsy nanana na inona na inona mihitsy aho tamin'izany.
The question is whether they will do it.	Ny fanontaniana dia ny hoe hanao izany ve izy ireo.
In fact, you should.	Tokony hanao izany koa ianao, raha ny marina.
Surely you have it.	Azo antoka fa manana izany ianao.
You know exactly what is wrong.	Fantatrao mazava tsara izay tsy mety.
That can be safe.	Mety ho azo antoka izany.
I may have to do this more often	Mety tsy maintsy manao izany matetika kokoa aho
I am, in fact, that person.	Izaho, raha ny marina, io olona io.
People are angry.	Tezitra ny olona.
I totally understand	azoko tanteraka
They are real.	Tena izy ireo.
I learned a lot from it too	Nianatra betsaka tamin’izany koa aho
A little money should be enough	Ny vola kely dia tokony ho ampy
Don’t worry about it, really.	Aza manahy momba izany, tena.
Thank you for starting this.	Misaotra anao nanomboka ity.
I don’t want him to stay anywhere	Tsy tiako hijanona na aiza na aiza izy
You will get used to it.	Ho zatra izany ianao.
There is, for sure.	Misy amin'izany, azo antoka.
I think you might know that too.	Heveriko fa mety ho fantatrao koa.
He did very well.	Tena tsara ny nataony.
I received good help	Nahazo fanampiana tsara aho
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.
He left after asking her for money	Lasa izy rehefa avy nangataka vola taminy
He came back and told me.	Niverina izy ary nilaza tamiko.
It was like we were sitting in a movie.	Toy ny nipetraka tao anaty sarimihetsika izahay.
You seem to be there.	Toa efa ho eo ianao.
But he liked it in the end	Saingy tiany izany tamin'ny farany
Yeah, kind of happy.	Eny, karazana faly.
The other is still very special.	Ny iray kosa mbola tena manokana.
Many women and children died	Vehivavy sy ankizy maro no maty
I will almost certainly come to see you	Saika ho avy hahita anao tokoa aho
It's too early.	Mbola aloha loatra.
I looked at the crowded room	Nijery ny efi-trano feno olona aho
When he returned, the baby died.	Rehefa niverina izy dia maty ilay zaza.
He was a very small man.	Lehilahy kely dia kely izy.
I really know that	Tena fantatro izany
It’s not much.	Tsy dia betsaka izany.
I had never thought of that before	Mbola tsy nieritreritra an'izany aho taloha
He never existed.	Tsy nisy mihitsy izy.
Surely I have a plausible reason	Azo antoka fa manana antony azo inoana aho
He thought they were leaving.	Nihevitra izy fa niala izy ireo.
Everything went well.	Nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
No words	Teny tsy misy
I thought it was really good	Nihevitra aho fa tena tsara izany raha ny marina
He was sitting in an empty spot.	Nipetraka teo amin’ny toerana tsy nisy izy.
I probably didn’t have to tell you that	Tsy voatery nilaza izany taminao angamba aho
Maybe you have too.	Angamba ianao manana koa.
I wanted more time with you	Naniry fotoana bebe kokoa niaraka taminao aho
I have no problem with that, good for you	Tsy manana olana amin'izany aho, tsara ho anao
I hate it.	Tsy tiako izany.
Then again, and again.	Avy eo indray, ary indray.
But of course there is more to it than that.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa mihoatra noho izany.
Maybe they need the money.	Mila ny vola angamba izy ireo.
He’s tough, tough.	Sarotra izy, sarotra .
I don’t know why she wanted a baby	Tsy haiko hoe nahoana izy no naniry zaza
I'm not sure where it's going	Tsy azoko antoka hoe ho aiza io
Just like eating well.	Toy ny mihinana tsara ihany.
But, this is the problem.	Saingy, io no olana.
He saw no one.	Tsy nahita olona izy.
So you tried hard not to.	Ka niezaka mafy ianao tsy hanao izany.
I couldn't think of him	Tsy afaka nieritreritra azy aho
We have to get out.	Tokony hivoaka isika.
I think they do the same	Heveriko fa manao toy izany koa izy ireo
I have had accidents before	Efa nisy loza aho taloha
She is very happy.	Tena faly izy.
He did it well.	Nanao izany tsara izy.
The one I got, the one I got	Ny iray azoko, ny iray azony
He always walked out the door.	Nivoaka ny varavarana foana izy.
So am I.	Dia izaho.
Very good player.	Tena mpilalao mahay.
No, tell him no.	Tsia, lazao azy hoe tsia.
He can no longer drive or read, too bad.	Tsy afaka mitondra fiara na mamaky teny intsony izy, tena ratsy.
Something others don’t know.	Zavatra tsy fantatry ny hafa.
I was surprised.	Gaga aho.
It's from me.	Avy amiko izany.
No, no.	Tsy misy, tsy misy.
Everything happened once.	Nitranga indray mandeha ny zava-drehetra.
It was a great day from start to finish.	Tena andro nahafinaritra nanomboka tamin'ny voalohany ka hatramin'ny farany.
One.	Iray.
I hope he comes back.	Manantena aho fa hiverina izy.
She is a wonderful woman and a wonderful actress.	Vehivavy mahafinaritra izy ary mpilalao sarimihetsika mahafinaritra.
I disagreed with that, anyway	Tsy nety aho tamin'izany, na izany na tsy izany
I’m not even sure what’s going to happen	Tsy azoko antoka mihitsy izay hitranga
Play it, and play it well.	Milalao azy, ary milalao azy tsara.
No more than three, the better two, the best one.	Tsy mihoatra ny telo, ny roa tsara kokoa, ny iray tsara indrindra.
To me, it was just a house. 	Amiko dia efa trano fotsiny ilay izy. 
However, I was able to do it anyway.	Na izany aza dia vitako ny manao izany na izany aza.
I just want him to love me	Tiako ho tia ahy fotsiny izy
It’s all already known.	Efa fantatra daholo izany.
He did not get to the place to come.	Tsy tonga teo amin'ilay toerana ho avy izy.
I'm a little confused	Somary very hevitra aho
Maybe nothing will happen.	Angamba tsy hisy zavatra hitranga.
I was happy to leave but I didn’t understand why	Faly aho niala nefa tsy azoko hoe nahoana
I’m sure we did something really great over the weekend.	Azoko antoka fa nanao zavatra tena lehibe izahay tamin'ny faran'ny herinandro.
I thought you would get it	Nihevitra aho fa ho azonao
I'll be back in about an hour.	Hiverina aho afaka adiny iray eo ho eo.
If he is angry.	Raha tezitra izy.
Very much so.	Tena betsaka tokoa.
I don't think he's interested	Heveriko fa tsy liana izy
He really loves them.	Tena tiany izy ireo.
Nothing like this, however.	Tsy misy toa izao, na izany aza.
You never do anything else.	Tsy manao zavatra hafa mihitsy ianao.
Some people don’t get it right.	Misy olona tsy mahazo tsara izany.
We had to work through the night.	Tsy maintsy niasa nandritra ny alina izahay.
I want to see what happens	Te hahita izay hitranga aho
I think that was a good fit	Heveriko fa nety tokoa izany
I can sleep anywhere	Afaka matory na aiza na aiza aho
Yes, not at home.	Eny, tsy ao an-trano.
Which leads to other bad news.	Izay mitondra any amin'ny vaovao ratsy hafa.
I just did the impossible	Vao avy nanao ny tsy azo atao aho
Really something for everyone	Tena zavatra ho an'ny rehetra
Don't tell me that.	Aza miteny amiko izany.
I think of them.	Mihevitra azy ireo aho.
But today is the last day for him.	Fa androany no andro farany ho azy.
I'll see what happens	Ho hitako izay nitranga
He just hoped it wasn’t too late.	Nanantena fotsiny izy fa tsy tara loatra.
I had a big question for them	Nanana fanontaniana lehibe iray ho azy ireo aho
He says you are sick.	Milaza izy fa marary ianao.
I wonder what he will do now	Manontany tena aho hoe inona no hataony izao
Surely he knew we were coming.	Azo antoka fa fantany fa ho avy izahay.
I think they were just scared	Heveriko fa natahotra fotsiny izy ireo
He has never been there.	Mbola tsy tonga tany mihitsy izy.
Very powerful song.	Tena hira mahery.
We are far from home.	Lavitra ny trano izahay.
The problem was completely different.	Hafa tanteraka ny olana tao.
I think we all know people like that	Heveriko fa mahafantatra olona toy izany daholo isika
I need to see you now	Mila mahita anao aho izao
I knew he was looking at me.	Fantatro fa nijery ahy izy.
I think people will be really happy	Heveriko fa tena ho faly ny olona

I just want to do a good job.	Te hanao asa tsara fotsiny aho.
We didn’t have it for a few months.	Tsy nanana izany izahay nandritra ny volana vitsivitsy.

I'm worried about him	Manahy azy aho
Unless you need them too.	Raha tsy hoe mila azy ireo koa ianao.
So, two questions.	Noho izany, fanontaniana roa.

We need a story like that.	Mila tantara toy izany izahay.
I will go but not return	Handeha aho fa tsy hiverina

i always get you	azoko foana ianao
We can’t go anywhere, we can’t do anything.	Tsy afaka mandeha na aiza na aiza isika, tsy afaka manao na inona na inona.
I will get a job after school, to help.	Hahazo asa aho rehefa avy mianatra, hanampy.

They never know who you are.	Tsy fantany mihitsy hoe iza ianao.

She may become a man and love another man.	Mety ho lasa lehilahy izy ary tia lehilahy hafa.
I was surprised to see him	Gaga aho nijery azy
And he loves us.	Ary tia antsika izy.

I came back fully conscious again	Niverina nahatsiaro tena tanteraka indray aho

I saw it	Izaho no nahita azy

I would never have done it without him	Tsy vitako mihitsy izany raha tsy nisy azy
If you love someone, you love them.	Raha tianao ny olona iray dia tianao izy ireo.
But maybe it’s because it’s not summer yet.	Fa angamba izany dia satria tsy mbola fahavaratra.
Outside, full and safe.	Any ivelany, feno sy azo antoka.
That sounds like a good idea.	Toa hevitra tsara izany.
Many people are afraid.	Maro ny olona matahotra.
I think that’s what really got him	Heveriko fa izany no tena nahazo azy
Of course, this happened to everyone, but nonetheless.	Mazava ho azy fa nitranga tamin'ny rehetra izany, saingy na izany aza.
I have seen it	Efa nahita izany aho

He already knows how to do it.	Efa fantany ny fomba hanaovana izany.
I still enjoyed doing it	Mbola nahafinaritra ahy ny nanao izany
For men, this is more difficult.	Amin'ny lehilahy dia sarotra kokoa izany.
I don't see what it is	Tsy hitako hoe inona izany

He really loved to play.	Tena tia nilalao izy.
I know you are still angry with me	Fantatro fa mbola tezitra amiko ianao

I'm not very good at it.	Tsy dia mahay loatra aho.
All of them, fine.	Izy rehetra, tsara.
I need you to do this to me now	Mila anao hanao izany amiko aho izao

I told you you were crazy	Nolazaiko taminao fa adala ianao
You are free.	Afaka ianao.
I know every word of every song	Fantatro ny teny rehetra amin'ny hira rehetra
It was really crazy at the time.	Tena adala tokoa tamin'izany fotoana izany.
It must be a mistake.	Tsy maintsy ho fahadisoana izany.
Either way, it’s not about where he’s going.	Na izany na tsy izany dia tsy hoe handeha ho aiza izy.
In fact, he likes it more than people.	Raha ny marina dia tiany kokoa noho ny olona izany.
And I also have two of those.	Ary manana roa amin'ireo ihany koa aho.

I met a guy, he was so busy saying no	Nihaona tamin'ny lehilahy iray aho, tena sahirana izy nilaza hoe tsia
I must.	Izaho dia tsy maintsy.
Even more so than before.	Mbola mihoatra noho ny taloha aza.
The news is what you want it to be.	Ny vaovao dia izay tianao ho.
I have been there.	Efa tany aho.
I need to get away with that	Mila miala amin'izany aho
I love about him	Tiako ny momba azy
And you know that’s good.	Ary fantatrao fa tsara izany.
Nowadays, a lot of people do it in a week.	Amin'izao fotoana izao, maro ny olona manao izany ao anatin'ny herinandro.

You just have to see it to believe it.	Mila mahita azy fotsiny ianao vao mino izany.

I think you get the picture	Heveriko fa azonao ny sary
He didn’t know how many he was but one thing was for sure.	Tsy fantany hoe firy izy fa zavatra iray no azo antoka.
I think there will be problems when he does that	Heveriko fa hisy olana rehefa manao izany izy
People are really nice.	Tena mahafinaritra ny olona.
The little ones go a long way.	Ny kely dia mandeha lavitra.
I didn't agree with that at all	Tsy nety tamin'izany mihitsy aho
And you know very well that it really happened.	Ary fantatrao mazava fa tena nisy izany.
I’ve never been here before but that doesn’t matter	Mbola tsy tonga teto mihitsy aho fa tsy maninona izany
I didn't even know he was there	Tsy fantatro akory hoe teo izy
I just wanted to.	Naniry fotsiny aho.
You can work hard.	Afaka miasa mafy ianao.
I want that to be a question	Tiako ho fanontaniana izany
He never thought of that.	Tsy nieritreritra izany mihitsy izy.
I really want to know	Tena tiako ho fantatra
They were always fun.	Nahafinaritra foana izy ireo.
So we have to see.	Ka tsy maintsy mahita isika.
I thought a little	Nieritreritra kely aho
That's what it is.	Izany no izy.
It’s hard to see that stuff.	Sarotra ny mahita izany zavatra izany.

I couldn't do that	Tsy afaka nanao izany aho
I needed to talk to him	Nila niresaka taminy aho
I really need it.	Tena mila izany aho.
I almost get no help	Saika tsy mahazo fanampiana aho
I have never seen anyone do that	Mbola tsy nahita olona manao izany aho

I see that I think	Hitako fa mieritreritra aho
He could not do it again.	Tsy afaka nanao izany indray izy.
But maybe that’s something else.	Fa angamba zavatra hafa izany.
We both want to win.	Samy te handresy isika.
It was a house, once.	Trano io, indray mandeha.
So now the good news.	Koa ankehitriny ny vaovao tsara.
It never seems to come back.	Toa tsy hiverina intsony.
The work is good.	Tsara ilay asa.
We need to know where we are.	Mila mahafantatra ny misy antsika isika.
I really enjoy reading the story	Tena tiako ny mamaky ny tantara
I had nothing	Tsy nanana na inona na inona aho
I need a lot of help.	Mila fanampiana be aho.
I want to be completely safe.	Tiako ho azo antoka tanteraka.
I think you will like it.	Heveriko fa ho tianao izany.
I agreed.	Niaiky aho.

They are the same.	Izy ireo ihany.
I don’t seem to understand much about him	Toa tsy azoko ny momba azy
But you know, maybe there’s something in there too.	Saingy fantatrao, angamba misy zavatra ao koa.
I love you both	Tiako ianareo roa
I thought about that question	Nieritreritra an'io fanontaniana io aho
Something he shouldn't do, but he probably doesn't know.	Zavatra tsy tokony hataony, nefa tsy fantany angamba.
We don't agree with that either.	Tsy mitovy hevitra amin’izany koa izahay.
They agreed that it was so	Niaiky izy ireo fa izany no izy
Not too much, but not too much.	Tsy dia be loatra, fa tsy dia be loatra.
He said almost once, then stopped.	Saika niteny indray mandeha izy, dia nijanona.
I want you two back here, in an hour	Tiako hiverina eto ianareo roa, afaka adiny iray
For the following reason, we believe he did.	Noho ny antony manaraka dia mino izahay fa nanao izany izy.
Very good.	Tena tsara.

I'm not sure you'll be interested.	Tsy azoko antoka raha ho liana ianao.
I can't think of him now	Tsy afaka mieritreritra azy aho izao
I thank you for everything	Misaotra anao amin'ny zavatra rehetra aho
The meeting tomorrow.	Ny fivoriana rahampitso.
I wondered that	Nanontany tena aho izany

I don’t know much about them.	Tsy dia fantatro loatra ny momba azy ireo.
We had room, we had lots of room.	Nanana efitrano izahay, nanana efitrano betsaka.
I hope you learned something.	Manantena aho fa nianatra zavatra ianao.
And yes, it can happen.	Ary eny, mety hitranga izany.
I'm not sure where it came from	Tsy azoko antoka hoe avy aiza
He came back to her.	Niverina ho azy izy.
I went back to the meeting.	Niverina tany amin’ny fivoriana aho.

I will go with him tonight	handeha hiaraka aminy aho anio alina
I’ve seen the big picture	Efa hitako ny sary lehibe
Too hard for me.	Mafy loatra amiko.
I couldn't look at him.	Tsy afaka nijery azy aho.
I was hoping to win him over.	Nanantena ny handresy azy aho.
I remember that one man came before	Tadidiko fa tonga io lehilahy iray io taloha

There should be no such person.	Tsy tokony hisy akory ny olona toa azy.
I could no longer do that	Tsy afaka nanao izany intsony aho

I'm used to being alone	Efa zatra irery aho
you get it.	azonao izany.
I had other ideas.	Nanana hevitra hafa.
Two days, three at most	Roa andro, telo raha be indrindra
These look great !.	Toa mahafinaritra ireo!.
I never thought of him like that	Tsy mbola nieritreritra azy toy izany aho
This is especially true today.	Marina indrindra izany ankehitriny.
I arrived at night.	Tonga alina aho.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Tsy misy na inona na inona azonao atao momba izany.
They don't see me.	Tsy mahita ahy izy ireo.
I will never make the mistake you make	Tsy hanao ny fahadisoana nataonao mihitsy aho

I was able to leave.	Afaka niala aho.

I was able to look at the big picture again.	Afaka nijery ny sary lehibe indray aho.
And she is no longer the woman.	Ary tsy izy intsony ilay vehivavy.
Then he lost interest.	Dia very liana izy.
Only he could do that.	Izy ihany no afaka nanao izany.
It will not and never will be.	Tsy hisy izany ary tsy hisy mihitsy.
His son, from the woman he loves.	Zanany, avy amin’ny vehivavy tiany.
I know you tried to do that to me	Fantatro fa niezaka nanao izany tamiko ianao
Time goes by.	Mandeha ny fotoana.
I will talk to him.	Hiresaka aminy aho.

The idea brought me.	Nitondra ahy ny hevitra.

I know exactly what to do	Fantatro tsara izay tokony hatao
I don’t like it, not yet	Tsy tiako izany, tsy mbola

No one spoke to him.	Tsy nisy niteny taminy.
It just isn’t enough.	Tsy ampy fotsiny izany.
He wanted so many things like that.	Naniry zavatra maro toy izany izy.
I was with him for almost two years	Efa ho roa taona aho no niaraka taminy
But more than that, too.	Saingy mihoatra noho izany ihany koa.
I'm not coming home tonight	Tsy hody aho anio alina
So that's what happened.	Ka izay no nitranga.
Maybe that's true.	Angamba marina izany.
They should be there.	Tokony ho ao izy ireo.
Sounds good or not.	Toa tsara sa tsy izany.
I went too hard for the road	Nandeha mafy loatra aho noho ny lalana

I knew it and he never said it	Fantatro izany ary tsy nilaza izany mihitsy izy
But he is very sick.	Fa tena marary izy.
I stayed.	Nijanona aho.
Dogs have to get used to them.	Tsy maintsy zatra azy ireo ny alika.
Actually, I’m not interested in traveling, but he loves it	Raha ny marina dia tsy liana amin'ny dia aho, fa izy no tia

He really doesn’t need me.	Tena tsy mila ahy izy.
Home with interest.	Trano misy liana.
There will be no money for me there.	Tsy hisy vola ho ahy ao.
But only far away.	Fa lavitra ihany.
I saw him in his room and everything was fine	Hitako tao amin'ny efitranony izy ary tsara daholo ny zava-drehetra
Maybe they work in a difficult place.	Angamba izy ireo miasa any amin’ny toerana sarotra.
And then another one.	Ary avy eo ny iray hafa.
I've never had that before.	Mbola tsy nanana an’izany mihitsy aho.
We may indeed find something.	Mety hahita zavatra tokoa isika.

It’s all mine.	Ahy daholo izany.
I might even go see him at home	Mety handeha hijery azy any an-trano mihitsy aza aho
I still help him	Mbola manampy azy aho
It was lost in the new image	Very tamin'ny sary vaovao izany
We worked like that.	Niasa toy izany izahay.
This would convince him that he was really there.	Izany dia handresy lahatra azy fa tena teo izy.
They don’t seem to care.	Toa tsy miraharaha izy ireo.
People who can easily do what they want.	Olona azony mora foana ny manao izay tiany.
It was not as if he had really thought about doing something else.	Tsy toy ny hoe nieritreritra mafy hanao zavatra hafa mihitsy izy.

I only found out two hours ago	Vao adiny roa lasa izay no fantatro
Especially when you are that woman.	Indrindra rehefa ianao io vehivavy io.
No one had ever said that to him before.	Tsy mbola nisy olona niteny toy izany taminy taloha.
And so he died.	Ary maty araka izany izy.
I told you to go	Nolazaiko anao ny mandeha
I can't talk to him now	Tsy afaka miresaka aminy aho izao

Maybe we really have it all.	Angamba tena manana izany rehetra izany isika.
Tell me that again.	Lazao ahy indray izany.

They were always with him.	Niaraka taminy foana izy ireo.
He was used to it.	Efa zatra izany izy.
I decided when he would come	Nanapa-kevitra aho hoe rahoviana izy no ho tonga
I will enter	Hiditra aho
I know the dangers.	Fantatro ny loza mety hitranga.
He seemed to be afraid of me no matter what.	Toy ny natahotra ahy izy na inona.
I couldn’t go out or do anything	Tsy afaka nivoaka na nanao na inona na inona aho
This is not bad.	Tsy ratsy izany.
I will do the book again	Izaho indray no hanao ny boky
He had to buy some time.	Tsy maintsy nividy fotoana kely izy.
They are very good.	Tena tsara izy ireo.
I knew something bad was going to happen	Fantatro fa hisy zavatra ratsy hitranga
I found a way.	Nahita fomba iray aho.
Maybe he should.	Angamba tokony ho izy.

I will do it for you.	Hataoko ao aminao izany.
But it was a long wait.	Saingy niandry mafy izany.
I think it doesn’t matter to them.	Heveriko fa tsy miraharaha azy ireo izany.
Many other people	Olona maro hafa
They treated us like their children.	Nitondra anay toy ny zanany izy ireo.
For him, it was good.	Ho azy dia tsara izany.
This is not me.	Tsy izaho ity.
People love you.	Tia anao ny olona.
And more often than not.	Ary matetika kokoa izany.
They are cars.	Fiara izy ireo.
These are good things.	Zavatra tsara ireo.
I'm a little sick now	Somary narary aho izao
Not so either.	Tsy izany koa.
I would love to have you here	Tiako ny manana anao eto

I tried to eat the book	Nanandrana nihinana ilay boky aho
He loved the earth.	Tiany ny tany.
Too many people read it.	Be loatra ny olona mamaky an'izany.
Yesterday's story.	Tantara ny omaly.
I finally did it	Vitako ihany ilay izy
Now and then.	Ankehitriny ary avy eo.
I immediately felt better	Tonga dia nahatsiaro tsara kokoa aho
Three reasons are known.	Antony telo no fantatra.
Maybe no one.	Angamba tsy misy olona.
But he did not say a word.	Fa tsy niteny akory izy.
I started doing that.	Nanomboka nanao izany aho.
I vividly remember the incident	Tadidiko tsara ilay zava-nitranga
He walked away again.	Nandeha niala indray izy.
When he came back, he couldn't look at me.	Rehefa niverina izy, dia tsy afaka nijery ahy.
It happened to me too.	Nitranga tamiko koa izany.
It’s just not safe at all.	Tsy azo antoka mihitsy izany.

We hope so.	Manantena izahay.

She was a little girl then.	Tamin’izany izy mbola kely.
I have nothing in common with others	Tsy manana na inona na inona aho amin'ny toerana misy ny hafa

I'm not entirely sure	Tsy azoko antoka tanteraka
I have a big problem with that	Manana olana lehibe amin'izany aho
I know that.	Fantatro izany.
I just looked	Nijery fotsiny aho
We don’t need to talk about it anymore.	Tsy mila miresaka momba izany intsony isika.

I still did well.	Mbola nanao tsara aho.
I don't understand what it is	Tsy azoko hoe inona izany
But you don't know who we are.	Nefa tsy fantatrao hoe iza izahay.
This is a good place.	Ity misy toerana tsara.
This is no longer true.	Tsy marina intsony izany.
I had to stop.	Tsy maintsy nijanona aho.
Very true, too.	Tena marina koa.
They look good too.	Toa tsara koa izy ireo.
I believe they will	Mino aho fa hanao izany izy ireo
No one stopped on the busy road.	Tsy nisy nijanona ny fiara teo amin’ilay lalana be olona.
And it doesn’t matter.	Ary tsy maninona izany.
It shouldn’t be done.	Tokony tsy ho vita izany.
I’m sure he’ll get it	Hahazo antoka aho fa ho azony izany

We need more of that	Mila bebe kokoa amin'izany isika
But that’s not a bad thing.	Saingy tsy zavatra ratsy izany.
But no one does that.	Saingy tsy misy olona manao izany.
This is not the real problem.	Tsy io no tena olana.
I really am not.	Tena tsy izany aho.
One woman and another woman cannot be one.	Tsy afaka ny ho iray ny vehivavy iray sy ny vehivavy iray hafa.
There are two ways to do this.	Misy fomba roa hanaovana izany.
I wanted many things at once	Naniry zavatra maro indray mandeha aho
I was really scared.	Tena natahotra aho.
I don't see how difficult it will be	Tsy hitako izay ho sarotra

I love this house has a history	Tiako ity trano ity dia manana tantara
I'm not that big	Tsy dia lehibe loatra aho
I wouldn’t do that, of course	Tsy hanao izany aho, mazava ho azy
And another.	Ary iray hafa.

That's what it is.	Izany no izy.
I hate it.	Tsy tiako izany.
This is new.	Vaovao izany.
I didn’t want to see what happened	Tsy te hahita izay nitranga aho
I'm really busy.	Tena sahirana aho.

It helps to look busy.	Manampy ny mijery be atao.
I don't believe that	Tsy mino izany aho
So don’t worry.	Koa aza manahy.
So, it seems really impossible.	Noho izany, toa tena tsy azo atao izany.
But of course, there are still big problems.	Saingy mazava ho azy fa mbola misy ny olana lehibe.
I was a little surprised	Somary gaga aho
Everyone has brought it.	Efa nitondra azy ny rehetra.
I learned it on the ground.	Nianatra izany aho teo amin'ny tany.
I don’t want to be rude	Tsy te ho tsy mahalala fomba aho

It’s hard to do that.	Sarotra ny manao izany.
I can’t believe you thought that	Tsy mino aho fa nieritreritra izany ianao

I already know all this	Efa fantatro izany rehetra izany
You couldn't call him.	Tsy afaka niantso azy ianao.
I slept for almost a day	Natory efa ho iray andro aho

Of course not.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izany.
To him.	Aminy.
This one looks the most fun.	Ity iray ity dia toa mahafinaritra indrindra.
We are in the movie.	Ao amin'ny sarimihetsika izahay.
I started writing about it	Nanomboka nanoratra momba izany aho

He thought he should love them too.	Nihevitra izy fa tokony ho tia azy ireo koa.
But again, don’t go.	Nefa indray, aza mandeha.
There is no chance they will be able to do that.	Tsy misy vintana ho afaka hanao izany izy ireo.
Because it doesn’t go away.	Satria tsy miala.
No, they will not.	Tsia, tsy hanao izany izy ireo.
They found friends there, went out in the evening.	Nahita namana tany izy ireo, nivoaka ny hariva.
I had work to do	Nanana asa tokony hatao aho

I don't remember a single one.	Tsy tadidiko na dia iray aza.
Car for two cars.	Fiara ho an'ny fiara roa.
Here's what you can do.	Izao no azonao atao .
It could be too fast.	Mety ho haingana loatra izany.
So here it goes.	Dia izao no mandeha.
A minute ago.	Iray minitra lasa.
I know he did something.	Fantatro fa nanao zavatra izy.
I didn’t really like being at home.	Tsy dia tiako loatra ny tao an-trano.
Just say when and where.	Lazao fotsiny hoe rahoviana ary aiza.
The house has already told me that.	Ny trano koa efa nilaza izany tamiko.
I was the only one there	Izaho irery no tao
I need you to meet me	Mila anao hihaona amiko aho
I don't care about that	Tsy miraharaha an'izany aho
That’s where the trouble started.	Teo no nanomboka ny olana.
I have time.	Manana fotoana aho.
Maybe that's wrong.	Diso angamba izany.
It's not fun.	Tsy mahafinaritra izany.
I should have said he already had one	Tokony ho nilaza aho fa efa manana iray izy
He is going well.	Mandeha tsara izy.
I went to see them.	Nandeha nijery azy ireo aho.
I couldn’t have done more than that.	Tsy afaka nanao mihoatra noho izany aho.
You seem to really want that.	Toa tena naniry izany ianao.
Either we stay here or we die here.	Na mijanona eto isika na maty eto.
I studied both of them	Nianatra azy roa aho
I have never seen him want something like that	Tsy mbola nahita azy naniry zavatra toy izany aho
They often address specific issues.	Matetika izy ireo dia miresaka olana manokana.
We are not so much the same.	Tsy mitovy loatra isika.
Either way, you don’t have to do it.	Na izany na tsy izany, tsy voatery nanao izany ianao.
He has a lot to do.	Be dia be ny zavatra hataony.
And now I have completely lost interest.	Ary ankehitriny very liana amiko tanteraka.
It really happened.	Tena zava-nitranga tokoa izany.
This is not good.	Tsy tsara izany.
He immediately returned to the room.	Niverina tao amin’ilay efitrano avy hatrany izy.
I would love to see him there one day	Tiako ny hahita azy indray andro any
They were all amazed.	Gaga izy rehetra.
The room was empty.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona ilay efitrano.
And the last will be first	Ary ny farany ho voalohany
It could be wrong.	Mety ho diso.
I don’t want to see them anymore.	Tsy te hahita azy ireo intsony aho.
I haven’t done it in a long time	Efa ela aho no tsy nanao
I know they’re not happy to see me watching them	Fantatro fa tsy faly izy ireo mahita ahy mijery azy ireo
It is still early in the morning.	Mbola vao maraina be izany.
I wouldn’t have done that	Tsy ho nanao izany aho
It doesn’t have to be perfect.	Tsy tokony ho tanteraka izany.
I think you’ll be good at some sort	Heveriko fa ho tsara ianao amin'ny karazana iray
I just need a minute.	Mila iray minitra fotsiny aho.
It’s great to work with these women.	Tena tsara ny miasa amin'ireo vehivavy ireo.
I didn’t think so at first.	Tsy nieritreritra an'izany aho tamin'ny voalohany.
Recent ideas	Hevitra vao haingana
But in the end, it never worked.	Saingy rehefa ela ny ela dia tsy nandeha mihitsy izany.
To have and not to have.	Ny manana sy ny tsy manana.
I asked him where he was from	Nanontany azy aho hoe avy aiza izy
It must be a mistake.	Tsy maintsy ho fahadisoana izany.
The day before.	Ny andro teo aloha.
How did men become like this.	Ahoana no nahatonga ny lehilahy ho toy izao.
He will never come.	Tsy ho avy tokoa izy.
It didn’t work out.	Tsy nahavita izany.
Unless these are not true.	Raha tsy hoe tsy marina ireo.
We did that.	Nanao izany izahay.
I enjoyed the last time I read this book	Nahafinaritra ahy ny fotoana farany namaky ity boky ity
He will learn.	Hianatra izy.

I had no idea you could do that.	Tsy nanana hevitra aho fa afaka manao izany ianao.
It can get big and bad.	Mety ho lasa lehibe sy ratsy izany.
I have never had one like them.	Mbola tsy nanana toa azy ireo mihitsy aho.
I want to go to school	Te handeha hianatra aho
He just saw her.	Vao nahita azy izy.
I think he is the same	Heveriko fa mitovy amin'izany koa izy
I hope to come back there one day.	Manantena aho fa hiverina indray andro any.
I just felt like staying there	Nahatsiaro ho te hijanona tao ihany aho
Someone is working on it.	Misy olona miasa amin'izany.
A man entered the room	Nisy lehilahy iray niditra tao amin’ilay efitrano
I can't go there anymore	Tsy afaka ho any intsony aho
Not a new problem.	Tsy olana vaovao.
There is no question about that.	Tsy misy fanontaniana momba izany.

Just wrong to me.	Diso fotsiny amiko.
I wanted to get rid of it all	Naniry ny hiala izany rehetra izany aho
I felt very small	Nahatsiaro tena kely aho
I'm done playing there	Vita ny nilalao teo aho
They stopped as soon as they saw me.	Nijanona izy ireo raha vao nahita ahy.
I am not far from him	Tsy lavitra azy aho
These are always the best.	Ireo no tsara indrindra foana.
I also know who did this to you	Fantatro koa hoe iza no nanao izany taminao
I was glad to see them back	Faly aho nahita azy ireo niverina

The truth is you will be smaller.	Ny marina dia ho kely kokoa ianao.
I see that.	Hitako izany.
I don’t want to have to stay here.	Tsy tiako ny tsy maintsy mijanona eto.
That's me today.	Izay no ahy androany.
We just love people.	Tia olona fotsiny izahay.
I think he bought them	Heveriko fa nividy azy ireo izy
I thought it was a woman	Noheveriko fa vehivavy ilay izy
These stories will come and go.	Ho avy sy handeha ireo tantara ireo.
And you might even love him.	Ary mety ho tia azy mihitsy aza.
Because it’s so good, and you know it.	Satria tsara loatra ilay izy, ary fantatrao izany.
I am a student like you	Mpianatra toa anao aho
Good.	Tsara.
So it’s all going to happen this year	Noho izany dia hitranga amin'ity taona ity izany rehetra izany

I work a little	Miasa kely aho
I walked a little	Nandeha kely aho

If not, it should be.	Raha tsy izany dia tokony ho izany.
This little one was wrong.	Tsy nety io kely io.
I just need to be with you	Mila miaraka aminao fotsiny aho
It's not just for kids, it's for everyone.	Tsy ho an’ny ankizy ihany izany fa ho an’ny rehetra.
I was able to stay there for hours	Afaka nijanona tao nandritra ny ora maro aho
It may not be.	Mety tsy izany.
I talked to him yesterday morning	Niresaka taminy aho omaly maraina
I was surprised when he didn’t	Gaga aho rehefa tsy nanao izany izy
I looked at nothing	Nijery na inona na inona aho
I’ve done work on it.	Efa nanao asa momba izany aho.

I knew they could have called	Fantatro fa afaka niantso izy ireo
I'm not really stupid	Tsy tena adala aho
I think he was wrong.	Heveriko fa diso izy.

I'm glad you're here with me	Faly aho fa eto miaraka amiko ianao
I had a special reason	Nanana antony manokana aho
Of course, don’t take it too far.	Mazava ho azy fa aza atao lavitra loatra izany.

Does anyone see that ?.	Misy mahita an'io ve?.
It would be bad.	Ho ratsy izany.
I recently heard this news	Vao haingana aho no nandre an'io vaovao io

Only one can hope.	Ny iray ihany no afaka manantena.
I said this morning that we would get to that	Nolazaiko androany maraina fa ho tonga amin'izany isika
Maybe he’s not a morning person.	Angamba tsy olona maraina izy.
If only that were true.	Raha mba marina izany.
I watched the man get out of the car	Nijery ilay lehilahy nivoaka ny fiara aho
I still don’t know everything	Mbola tsy fantatro daholo ny zava-drehetra
It's not like this anymore.	Tsy toy izao intsony.

Can be done anytime anywhere.	Azo atao amin'ny fotoana rehetra na aiza na aiza.
I no longer know who he is	Tsy fantatro intsony hoe iza izy

They don't need us.	Tsy mila antsika izy ireo.
I have been waiting a long time	Efa ela be aho no niandry

He can't go tomorrow.	Tsy afaka mandeha izy rahampitso.
I would never have had a better friend than you	Tsy ho nanana namana tsara noho ianao mihitsy aho
I found something to look forward to last night	Nahita zavatra niandry aho omaly hariva
I have never seen anything so beautiful	Mbola tsy nahita zavatra tsara tarehy toy izany aho
I remember that now.	Tadidiko izany ankehitriny.
But maybe it’s too fast.	Fa angamba dia haingana loatra izany.
I really want to be the last	Tena tiako ny ho farany
Or, worse, you’re nobody.	Na, ratsy kokoa, tsy misy olona ianao.
And she looked at her son.	Dia nijery ny zanany izy.
He has had enough.	Efa ampy izy.
I apologize for that actually.	Miala tsiny amin'izany aho raha ny marina.
I really need information	Tena mila vaovao aho
Maybe it is.	Mety angamba izany.
I love that about them	Tiako izany momba azy ireo
But that’s a problem.	Saingy olana izany.
He didn't do that very often.	Tsy nanao izany matetika izy.
He wondered why.	Nanontany tena momba ny antony izy.
We don’t want to do that.	Tsy te hanao izany izahay.
Then you two will get nothing.	Dia tsy hahazo na inona na inona ianareo roa.
You have no food.	Tsy manana sakafo ianao.
Why did we wait so long ?.	Nahoana isika no niandry ela be?.
And the two of us were usually there during the day.	Ary matetika izahay roa no teo nandritra ny andro.
Which is good though.	Izay tsara na izany aza.
I need to think of them as food	Mila mihevitra azy ireo ho sakafo aho
One is a man, the other is a woman.	Lehilahy ny iray, vehivavy ny iray.
It was a really big year.	Tena taona lehibe tokoa izany.
I had to take a closer look at them	Tsy maintsy nijery akaiky azy ireo aho
There will be no more.	Tsy hisy intsony.
I was surprised to see him	Gaga aho nijery azy
I quickly decided not to tell him	Nanapa-kevitra haingana aho tsy hilaza aminy

This is the last one again.	Ity indray no farany.
The good man.	Ny lehilahy tsara.
I can't say for sure	Tsy afaka milaza marina aho
I will be better tomorrow.	Ho tsara kokoa aho rahampitso.
He has already done so.	Efa nanao izany izy.
I really don’t see anyone calling me that	Tena tsy hitako izay niantso ahy toy izany
I just knew someone was watching me	Fantatro fotsiny fa nisy nijery ahy

I know you are busy	Fantatro fa sahirana ianao
You can see them.	Afaka mahita azy ireo ianao.
Where are they from.	Avy aiza izy ireo.
It’s like he is.	Toy ny hoe izy.
I knew it shouldn’t have happened, but it did	Fantatro fa tsy tokony ho nisy izany, saingy nisy izany
It's all empty.	Foana daholo.
I had no money	Tsy nanana vola aho
I need to do a few things	Mila manao zavatra vitsivitsy aho
We didn’t come out with anything.	Tsy nivoaka na inona na inona izahay.
They didn’t try it again after we made them.	Tsy nanandrana izany intsony izy ireo rehefa avy nanao azy ireo izahay.
I was able to play too	Afaka nilalao koa aho
I really hope so.	Tena manantena izany aho.
And he is not stupid.	Ary tsy adala izy.
It’s all so fast.	Haingana tokoa izany rehetra izany.
I want to get back to you.	Te hiverina aminao aho.
There is only one thing.	Zavatra iray ihany no misy.
This is something new.	Zavatra vaovao izany.
I wondered if he was really scared	Nanontany tena aho raha tena natahotra izy
So small.	Ka kely .
Let them leave	Aleo izy ireo niala
I don’t want to talk about it	Tsy te hiresaka momba izany aho
They may not even know it.	Mety tsy fantany akory izany.
I am a good man. 	Lehilahy tsara aho. 
I think they are good	Heveriko fa tsara izy ireo
I was no longer afraid	Tsy natahotra intsony aho
I find that very wrong.	Tena diso izany hitako.
It never worked.	Tsy nety mihitsy izany.
I know a few people like that.	Mahafantatra olona vitsivitsy toy izany aho.
Surely they play the same way.	Azo antoka fa milalao toy izany koa izy ireo.
Do you.	Ianao ve.
He thought he must be crazy.	Nihevitra izy fa tsy maintsy ho adala.
He is done.	Vita izy.
I looked at him again.	Nijery azy indray aho.
I thought everything would be better	Nihevitra aho fa ho tsara kokoa ny zava-drehetra
No, there was something else.	Tsia, nisy zavatra hafa.
This is very true.	Tena marina izany.
It called outside again.	Niantso teo ivelany indray ilay izy.
But it doesn’t matter, really.	Fa tsy maninona, tena.

Lots of crazy stuff.	Be dia be ny zavatra adala.
I think they might be in trouble	Heveriko fa mety ho sahirana izy ireo

I will do that thing	Hanao izany zavatra izany aho
I am beautiful in this dress	Tsara tarehy aho amin'ity akanjo ity
They are strong.	Mahery izy ireo.
The question is difficult.	Sarotra ny fanontaniana.
I really want him to be a good man	Tena tiako izy mba ho lehilahy tsara
I don’t believe he did anything like that.	Tsy mino aho fa nanao zavatra toy izany izy.
I hope someone won’t be looking at this book anytime soon.	Manantena aho fa hisy olona tsy mbola hijery ity boky ity tsy ho ela.
He is there now.	Ao izy izao.
I only know one way.	Fomba iray ihany no fantatro.
There are things you can do.	Misy zavatra azonao atao.
I fell asleep after work this morning	Natory aho rehefa avy niasa androany maraina
I enjoyed the time	Nahafinaritra ahy ny fotoana

I waited for him to return	Niandry azy hiverina aho
He knows what he wants.	Fantany izay tiany.
I tried one last time	Nanandrana farany aho
We may have it.	Mety manana izany isika.
It’s personal, personal.	Izany dia manokana, manokana.
I really don’t know that	Tena tsy fantatro izany
All that can be done is to wait for it.	Ny hany azo atao dia ny miandry azy.
I am a woman.	Vehivavy aho.
I love him, he loves me	Tiako izy, tia ahy izy
I always think.	Mieritreritra foana aho.
And about that.	Ary momba izany.
Either way you are too hard.	Na manao ahoana na manao ahoana ianao dia mafy loatra.
Here is why.	Izao no antony.
They try to help you do that.	Miezaka manampy anao hanao izany izy ireo.
I watched it all from above	Nijery izany rehetra izany avy any ambony aho
It will be easy.	Ho mora izany.
I told her it was so beautiful	Nolazaiko azy fa tena tsara tarehy
I will not look at them again	Tsy hijery azy ireo intsony aho
You will love him.	Ho tia azy ianao.
Even if it looks the same.	Na dia toa azy ihany aza.
No one said bad things to us.	Tsy nisy nilaza teny ratsy taminay.
I was still afraid of the unknown	Mbola natahotra ny tsy fantatra aho
I will be gone soon.	Tsy ho ela aho dia ho lasa.
Let's go home now.	Aleo mody izao.
I absolutely need you for me	Mila anao ho ahy tanteraka aho

It is still late in the afternoon.	Mbola vao tolakandro.
But two problems.	Saingy olana roa.
The police were there.	Teo ny polisy.
He does not intend.	Tsy mikasa izy.
Very beautiful.	Tena tsara tarehy.
He is not the first.	Tsy izy no voalohany.
I don't understand.	Tsy azoko.
The room looked like it had never been before.	Ny efitrano dia toa mbola tsy nisy toy izany.
I should have seen something.	Tokony ho nahita zavatra aho.
Then he finally saw us.	Dia nahita anay izy tamin'ny farany.
Of course he was not there.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy teo izy.
You see something.	Mahita zavatra ianao.
You have done enough for others.	Efa ampy ho an'ny hafa ny nataonao.
It’s not too bad.	Tsy dia ratsy loatra izany.
I like good clothes.	Tia akanjo tsara aho.
I have a house and a car	Manana trano sy fiara aho
I don’t remember who	Tsy tadidiko hoe iza

It goes even further.	Mbola lavitra kokoa izany.
You asked for it.	Nangataka izany ianao.

I am not alone in everything	Tsy irery aho amin'ny zavatra rehetra
I will stay here	Hijanona eto aho

I still can't do it.	Mbola tsy vitako izany.
It's gone.	Lasa izany.
I kinda had a bad night	Somary nanana alina ratsy aho
No one is willing to help.	Tsy misy olona vonona hanampy.
I don’t know how many	Tsy fantatro hoe firy
I think they feared him more than anything	Heveriko fa natahotra azy mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra izy ireo
He will get nothing more from her.	Tsy hahazo na inona na inona aminy intsony izy.
We don’t plan to go anywhere.	Tsy mikasa ny handeha ho aiza izahay.
Never angry.	Tsy tezitra mihitsy.
He was a good friend.	Namana tsara izy.
I think that’s all a good idea.	Heveriko fa hevitra tsara izany rehetra izany.
Who wants to say everything, everything is perfect.	Iza no te hilaza ny zava-drehetra, tanteraka ny zava-drehetra.
I still remember it, like yesterday	Mbola tadidiko ilay izy, toy ny omaly
They are one and the same.	Iray ihany izy ireo.
I haven't found a word yet	Mbola tsy nahita teny aho
I've told you that before	Efa nolazaiko anao izany taloha

I have never seen him so happy	Mbola tsy nahita azy faly toy izany aho
He is not.	Tsy izy.
I entered the place	Niditra tao amin'ilay toerana aho

I need someone who can talk to me	Mila olona afaka miresaka amiko aho
This is absolutely unbelievable.	Tena tsy azo inoana izany.
You help people.	Manampy olona ianao.
Now it is all gone.	Ankehitriny dia lasa izany rehetra izany.
I don’t want to be like this	Tsy te ho tonga toy izao aho
And these are two different things.	Ary zavatra roa samy hafa ireo.
I know the day will come	Fantatro fa ho avy ny andro
That was a big help.	Fanampiana be izany.
You will stay for dinner, of course.	Hijanona mandritra ny sakafo hariva ianao, mazava ho azy.
That’s what brought him back.	Izay no nahatonga azy niverina.

I started sleeping a lot	Nanomboka natory be aho
A lot of people have written to you	Betsaka ny olona nanoratra anao
He is really dead.	Tena maty izy.
I didn’t want anything from him or anyone	Tsy naniry na inona na inona taminy na iza na iza aho
I thought you were just angry	Nihevitra aho fa tezitra fotsiny ianao
It won't help.	Tsy hanampy izany.
I'm confused	Very hevitra aho
I know the man.	Fantatro ilay lehilahy.
Do the same job.	Manao asa mitovy.
He was sure he did.	Azony antoka fa nanao izany izy.
I’m not really sure what was waiting for me	Tsy tena azoko antoka izay niandry ahy
He waited a moment, then said.	Niandry kely izy, dia niteny.
Well, maybe he wouldn’t like it now.	Eny, angamba tsy ho tiany izany ankehitriny.
It has to do something.	Tsy maintsy manao zavatra izany.
Maybe he can still talk about it.	Angamba mbola afaka miresaka momba izany izy.
I shouldn't be here	Tsy tokony ho eto aho
The truth will surely come out in the end.	Azo antoka fa hivoaka ny marina amin’ny farany.
It has to be real.	Tsy maintsy tena izy io.
I thought he wouldn’t come or not	Nieritreritra aho hoe tsy ho avy izy na tsia
Of course not, because he was just looking at her.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izany, satria nijery azy fotsiny izy.
The dog will look at a man	Ny alika dia hijery lehilahy iray
He didn’t know these men, but he knew what kind of people they were.	Tsy fantany ireo lehilahy ireo, saingy fantany ny karazana azy ireo.
He talked a little at first.	Niresaka kely izy tamin’ny voalohany.
Don’t hesitate.	Aza misalasala.
I really needed money	Tena nila vola aho
And he doesn’t.	Ary tsy manao izany izy.
I really think it’s all mine	Tena mieritreritra aho fa ny ahy rehetra
We are no longer alone.	Tsy irery intsony izahay.
There will be no more.	Tsy hisy intsony.
I had nothing	Tsy nanana na inona na inona aho
We need to get out of here.	Mila miala eto isika.
I won't even look at you	Tsy hijery anao akory aho
It was an almost impossible task.	Asa saika tsy vita izany.
I was really close.	Efa akaiky tokoa aho.
He was a man who never saw it coming.	Lehilahy tsy nahita izany ho avy izy.
I'm really thinking of quitting	Tena mieritreritra ny hiala aho
If it’s close, it’s real.	Raha akaiky dia tena izy.
Not like now.	Tsy toy ny ankehitriny.
I was able to keep going.	Afaka nandeha hatrany aho.
I don't remember anything	Tsy tadidiko na inona na inona
I don’t do anything else.	Tsy misy zavatra hafa ataoko.
I almost saw us outside	Saika nahita anay tany ivelany aho
I know it won’t happen	Fantatro fa tsy hisy izany
This is not a new idea.	Tsy hevitra vaovao izany.
I should be more.	Tokony ho bebe kokoa aho.
The man here is.	Ny lehilahy eto dia.
I think that's what it is.	Heveriko fa izany no izy.
And so he knew he was great.	Ary noho izany dia fantany fa lehibe izy.
He could still see her.	Mbola afaka nahita azy izy.
I think it’s for the best.	Heveriko fa ho an'ny tsara indrindra izany.
I am very sick.	Tena marary aho.
He had nothing.	Tsy nanana na inona na inona izy.
I desperately wanted to go home	Naniry mafy ny hody azy aho
In the same way.	Amin'ny fomba mitovy.
They are not ready.	Tsy vonona izy ireo.
There must be a reason for him to come back here.	Tsy maintsy misy antony nahatonga azy niverina teto.
But we will not return.	Saingy tsy hiverina isika.
Well, what is it.	Eny ary, inona izany.
But this song is exactly what speaks to me	Fa io hira io indrindra no tena miresaka amiko
I didn’t even feel like one	Tsy nahatsiaro ho iray akory aho
That can't happen.	Tsy mety hitranga izany.
I know it took a lot of time	Fantatro fa nila fotoana be izany
You must be with me now.	Tsy maintsy miaraka amiko ianao izao.
He had to leave quickly.	Tsy maintsy niala haingana izy.
It might do that.	Mety hanao izany.
I can't find the door	Tsy hitako ny varavarana
Thanks for the opportunity !.	Misaotra tamin'ny fahafahana!.
They were once children too.	Mbola zaza koa izy ireo indray mandeha.
It will not be easy.	Tsy ho mora izany.
I am so happy for you.	Faly be ho anao aho.
But that seems wrong.	Saingy toa diso izany.
I know this place is not for him	Fantatro fa tsy ho azy io toerana io
They just worked.	Niasa ihany ireo.
The baby died a lot.	Maty be ilay zaza.
And then we waited for more.	Ary avy eo dia niandry bebe kokoa izahay.
There is very little you can do.	Tena kely dia kely ny azonao atao.
I can't find his car.	Tsy hitako ny fiarany.
They go well with everything.	Mandeha tsara amin'ny zavatra rehetra izy ireo.
No one is too happy about that.	Tsy misy faly loatra amin'izany.
I have no idea where he came from	Tsy fantatro mihitsy hoe avy aiza izy
It wasn’t enough, but we had to do something.	Tsy ampy izany, saingy tsy maintsy nanao zavatra izahay.
Now, everyone knows it and it’s harder.	Ankehitriny, fantatry ny rehetra ny rehetra ary sarotra kokoa izany.
I can't have them.	Tsy afaka manana azy ireo aho.
Her children came first.	Ny zanany no tonga voalohany.
No one spoke to him.	Tsy nisy niresaka taminy.
It only takes him a little while to get there.	Mila fotoana kely fotsiny izy vao tonga amin'izany izao.
He knew it.	Fantany izany.
Made up.	Vita amin'ny.
I can’t, and no one can.	Tsy afaka aho, ary tsy afaka na iza na iza.
I never could have expected it to be	Tsy afaka nanantena ny ho izany mihitsy aho
Or, almost quickly.	Na, saika haingana.
They decided to stay there.	Nanapa-kevitra ny hijanona ao izy ireo.
I don't remember when	Tsy tadidiko hoe oviana
Words when he died.	Teny rehefa maty izy.
I need to talk to the woman	Mila miresaka amin’ilay vehivavy aho
I’m still not sure why that happened	Mbola tsy azoko antoka ny antony nahatonga izany
I’ve loved it for years	Tiako izany nandritra ny taona maro
But you didn't do it.	Fa ianao no tsy nahavita azy.
Tell him you are from me.	Lazao azy fa avy amiko ianao.
I have to lose this.	Tsy maintsy very ity aho.
I know people are still watching	Fantatro fa mbola mijery ny olona
I really liked it once.	Tena tiako ilay izy indray mandeha.
They were like last night.	Toy ny omaly hariva izy ireo.
We need you to survive.	Mila anao izahay mba ho velona.
The food is good, easy and honest.	Tsara ny sakafo, mora ary marina.
Of course, that will never happen.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy hitranga mihitsy izany.
They never say anything.	Tsy miteny na inona na inona mihitsy izy ireo.
I can find other jobs there	Afaka mahita asa hafa any aho
He didn't need to think long.	Tsy nila nieritreritra ela izy.
I, myself, have had enough	Izaho, izaho, dia efa ampy
It still doesn't work.	Mbola tsy mandeha ihany.
He thought it was okay.	Nihevitra izy fa mety.
I'm scared.	Matahotra ahy.
It hurts to think about it again.	Marary indray ny mieritreritra an'izany.
Not from you.	Tsy avy aminao.
He did not see the woman.	Tsy nahita ilay vehivavy izy.
I can follow after that	Afaka manaraka aho rehefa avy eo
I'm not sure about that.	Tsy azoko antoka izany.
I left, whether he liked it or not	Lasa aho, na tiany na tsy tiany
I thought someone was in a lot of trouble	Nihevitra aho fa nisy olona sahirana mafy
And that's not what he wanted either.	Ary tsy izany koa no tiany.
These look good.	Toa tsara ireo.
If for no reason, it doesn’t matter.	Raha tsy misy antony dia tsy maninona.
I never had to talk to him about it	Tsy voatery niresaka taminy momba izany mihitsy aho
I wished I could say that	Naniry ny ho afaka hilaza izany aho
And he didn’t like it.	Ary tsy tiany izany.
I sat down and studied them.	Nipetraka aho ary nianatra azy ireo.
I didn’t want to anymore	Tsy naniry intsony aho
And it’s so beautiful.	Ary tena tsara tarehy izany.
Just like them.	Tahaka azy ireo ihany.
I know people want to do what they want	Fantatro fa te hanao izay tiany ny olona
This is very clear.	Mazava be izany.
You look angry.	Toa tezitra ianao.
We have to do it the hard way.	Tsy maintsy manao izany amin'ny fomba sarotra isika.
I would definitely buy this.	Tena hividy an'io aho.
These kinds of things.	Ireo karazana zavatra ireo.
I will help you.	Hanampy anao aho.
Some say it’s too easy.	Misy milaza fa mora loatra izany.
He never did it again.	Tsy nanao izany intsony izy.
Women don’t like that.	Tsy tia an'izany ny vehivavy.
We drove.	Nandeha fiara izahay.
We are not looking in the right place.	Tsy mijery amin'ny toerana mety isika.
I don’t believe it’s going to happen	Tsy mino aho fa hitranga izany
I know you're not.	Fantatro fa tsy ianao.
He did not want to do anything more.	Tsy naniry hanao zavatra mihoatra noho izany izy.
I knew he wanted to go home	Fantatro fa te hody izy
I have him, he sure is	Manana azy aho, azo antoka izy
This guy gets it.	Ity lehilahy ity dia mahazo izany.
That was a week ago.	Izany dia herinandro lasa izay.
You never said that.	Tsy nilaza izany mihitsy ianao.
It was fun, it was fun, it was fun.	Nahafinaritra, nahafinaritra, nahafinaritra.
You can go anywhere.	Afaka mandeha na aiza na aiza ianao.
I will not do that again	Tsy hanao izany intsony aho
He was already playing with his heart, and it wasn’t enough.	Efa nilalao ny fony izy, ary tsy ampy izany.
He had to go.	Tsy maintsy nandeha izy.
I am not known.	Tsy fantatra aho.
It could be in the car.	Mety ho ao anaty fiara izany.
I used to, when I was a kid	Taloha aho, fony mbola zaza
I thought everything you did was right	Noheveriko fa mety daholo ny nataonao
I shouldn't have left	Tsy tokony ho lasa aho
I know you will be fine	Fantatro fa ho tsara ianao
Neither do you.	Tsy ianao koa.
Difficult.	Sarotra.
I always thought	Nieritreritra foana aho
He said he would enter.	Nilaza izy fa hiditra.
I spent the day learning how to do it	Nandany ny andro nianatra ny fomba hanaovana izany aho
And that's it.	Ary izany no izy.
They just tried to survive, just like him.	Niezaka ny ho velona ihany izy ireo, toa azy.
Then everything is clear and true.	Dia mazava sy marina ny zava-drehetra.
But now he’s gone again anyway.	Saingy izao dia lasa indray izy na izany aza.
I think not too long ago	Heveriko fa tsy ela akory izay
I'm not ready for you.	Tsy vonona ho anao aho.
I needed to ask you now	Nila nanontany anao aho izao
I never thought he would be like this	Tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe ho toy izao izy
I came to the story	Tonga tamin'ny tantara aho
I'm afraid that day won't come	Matahotra aho sao tsy ho avy io andro io
Mine worked well.	Ny ahy dia niasa tsara.
I don’t know why, he just does.	Tsy haiko hoe nahoana, izy fotsiny no manao.
So whatever, in other words.	Ka na inona na inona, amin'ny teny hafa.
I need help	Mila fanampiana aho
I was so wrong	Tena diso aho
He did not want a job he loved.	Tsy naniry asa tiany izy.
I started walking	Nanomboka nandeha aho
I learned something here	Nianatra zavatra iray aho teto
If he leaves, fine.	Raha miala izy dia tsara.
It’s hard for me to go anywhere.	Sarotra amiko ny mandeha na aiza na aiza.
I didn’t stop.	Tsy nijanona aho.
Maybe he has bad news.	Angamba izy manana vaovao ratsy.
I should have seen him	Tokony ho efa nahita azy aho
I was scared, you know	Natahotra aho, fantatrao
These cars are to come.	Ireo fiara ireo no ho avy.
I was surprised when they started playing	Gaga aho rehefa nanomboka nilalao izy ireo
Not mine at all.	Tsy ny ahy mihitsy.
Nothing happened, which is good.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona nitranga, izay tsara.
I was always there	Teo foana aho
I can follow after that.	Afaka manaraka aho rehefa avy eo.
I never looked at it	Tsy nijery izany mihitsy aho
He knew immediately that he had made a serious mistake.	Fantany avy hatrany fa nanao fahadisoana lehibe izy.
Don’t just ask that.	Aza manontany fotsiny izany.
I didn’t like him around	Tsy tiako izy teo akaiky teo
We did something good.	Nanao zavatra tsara izahay.
I have something else	Manana zavatra hafa aho
If not more.	Raha tsy mihoatra.
Nothing happened.	Tsy nisy na inona na inona nitranga.
He didn’t read anything about me.	Tsy namaky na inona na inona momba ny ahy izy.
It never came.	Tsy tonga mihitsy izany.
I was glad to see that	Faly aho nahita izany
Little for us.	Kely ho antsika.
Today there were many.	Androany dia nisy betsaka.
We have two ideas.	Manana hevitra roa izahay.
We have nothing.	Tsy manana na inona na inona izahay.
I looked where it was	Nijery izay nisy aho
I will watch	Hijery aho
I told him all that	Nolazaiko azy daholo izany
I could never think of anything stupid	Tsy afaka nieritreritra zavatra adala mihitsy aho
He was not ready for that.	Tsy vonona tamin’izany izy.
You can only have one.	Afaka manana iray ihany ianao.
He didn't look at her but waited.	Tsy nijery azy izy fa niandry.
At the moment.	Amin'izao fotoana izao.
He sleeps with another woman.	Matory miaraka amin'ny vehivavy hafa izy.
I want to help them	Te hanampy azy ireo aho
Or maybe even three.	Na mety ho telo mihitsy aza.
But he doesn’t have it.	Saingy tsy manana izany izy.
And something else.	Ary zavatra hafa.
I was so scared when you called me	Natahotra be aho raha vao niantso ahy ianao
No, more than that.	Tsia, mihoatra noho izany.
No one wanted that.	Tsy nisy naniry izany.
It looks like a big dog.	Toa ny alika lehibe izy io.
I felt free and alive	Nahatsiaro ho afaka sy velona aho
I'm not worried.	Tsy sahirana aho.
I need to see that	Mila mahita izany aho
It is one on one.	Izy io dia iray amin'ny iray.
Then again, maybe not.	Avy eo indray, mety tsy.
Of course, they are different.	Mazava ho azy fa samy hafa izy ireo.
We can't.	Tsy afaka izahay.
A little while ago maybe	Fotoana kely lasa izay angamba
I bought a house, then a house	Nividy trano aho, avy eo trano
Thank you for having me again.	Misaotra anao nanana ahy indray.
I didn’t ask how much he got	Tsy nanontany aho hoe ohatrinona no azony
Of course, he was still there.	Mazava ho azy fa mbola teo ihany izy.
You can believe yours too.	Afaka mino ny anao koa ianao.
This is often the case.	Matetika izany.
I just went crazy thinking about everything	Lasa adala fotsiny aho nieritreritra ny zava-drehetra
I have to go back.	Tokony hiverina aho.
I love doing this for everyone	Tiako ny manao izany ho an'ny rehetra
You can sit for a very long time.	Afaka mipetraka ela be ianao.
It’s really hard.	Tena sarotra izany.
I will not be angry	Tsy ho tezitra aho
I left the unknown	Niala tamin'ny tsy fantatra aho
I think it’s good for them	Heveriko fa tsara ho azy ireo izany
It’s a really beautiful thing.	Tena zavatra tsara tarehy izany.
It takes time, maybe a long time.	Mila fotoana izy, angamba ela be.
I really wanted to see that	Tena naniry ny hahita izany aho
It was all a good day.	Andro tsara daholo izany.
Everyone will know.	Ho fantatry ny rehetra.
Without them, we would not exist.	Raha tsy nisy azy ireo dia tsy nisy isika.
There is nothing like it.	Tsy misy toa azy.
We don’t do that.	Tsy manao izany izahay.
This will not be easy.	Tsy ho vita mora izany.
I’m not sure if he’s alive or dead	Tsy azoko antoka na velona izy na maty
But to me that is not right.	Fa amiko tsy mety izany.
That's what it is.	Izany no izy.
I never knew it happened	Tsy fantatro mihitsy hoe nitranga izany
That's what he wants to do.	Izany no tiany hatao.
I have to try and sleep	Tsy maintsy miezaka aho ary matory
The big, the small.	Ny lehibe, ny kely.
I think there was a small one.	Heveriko fa nisy iray kely.
Kind of a student maybe.	Karazana mpianatra angamba.
I was so happy when he talked to me	Tena faly aho rehefa niresaka tamiko izy
They will be ready.	Ho vonona izy ireo.
I still think so.	Mbola mieritreritra izany aho.
I don't know that	Tsy fantatro izany
I'm happy with that	Faly aho amin'izany
I'll add a picture in a minute	Hanampy sary afaka iray minitra aho
I didn’t say anything to him about it	Tsy nilaza na inona na inona taminy momba izany aho
Maybe not in a bad way.	Angamba tsy amin'ny fomba ratsy.
I just need to know a few things	Mila mahafantatra zavatra vitsivitsy fotsiny aho
And talked to the dog.	Ary niresaka tamin'ny alika.
You don’t have to look farther than I do.	Tsy mila mijery lavitra noho izaho ianao.
I need to see them.	Mila mahita azy ireo aho.
I needed to tell him the truth	Nila nilaza ny marina taminy aho
I never saw any help for him	Tsy hitako izay fanampiana azy mihitsy
That’s how to do it.	Izany no fomba hanaovana izany.
I needed to ask him why.	Nila nanontany azy aho hoe nahoana.
It won’t be the only thing.	Tsy ho ny hany zavatra.
He could be here in a day.	Mety ho tonga tao anatin’ny iray andro izy.
I haven’t even started yet.	Mbola tsy nanomboka akory aho.
The rain is good.	Tsara ny orana.
It’s really hard to write it down.	Sarotra mihitsy ny nanoratra azy.
I still refused.	Mbola tsy nety aho.
I knew it was going to be very difficult	Fantatro fa ho sarotra be izany
But he didn’t have that woman.	Saingy tsy nanana izany vehivavy izany.
I decided this morning, in fact	Nanapa-kevitra aho androany maraina, raha ny marina
Or it could just be a disaster.	Sa mety ho loza ihany.
It’s huge.	Lehibe dia lehibe.
I just can’t stay here	Tsy afaka mijanona eto fotsiny aho
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Efa ela aho no nieritreritra an'io.
It’s an idea thing.	Zavatra hevitra izany.
I spoke face to face	Niresaka tamin'ny tarehy aho
I believe this is true	Mino aho fa marina izany
I don't see it happening.	Tsy hitako fa misy izy io.
He never cursed.	Tsy niteny ratsy mihitsy izy.
I am not a very good person	Tsy olona tena tsara aho
An hour passed	Adiny iray no lasa
Something completely different.	Zavatra hafa tanteraka.
We do the same.	Manao toy izany koa izahay.
There was a good reason for this.	Nisy antony tsara nahatonga izany.
Just the truth.	Ny marina ihany.
But only a movie.	Fa sarimihetsika ihany.
And not just ideas.	Ary tsy hevitra fotsiny.
They say it’s about food.	Milaza izy ireo fa momba ny sakafo.
You are confused.	Very hevitra ianao.
It will not happen to me.	Tsy hitranga amiko izany.
I couldn't think of you	Tsy afaka nieritreritra momba anao aho
I think it made him a better person	Heveriko fa nahatonga azy ho olona tsara kokoa izany
You may be confused.	Mety ho very hevitra ianao.
A lot of things can happen at a time like this.	Betsaka ny zavatra mety hitranga amin'ny fotoana toy izany.
I don’t believe he did what he seemed to be doing.	Tsy mino aho fa nanao izay toa nataony izy.
You don’t want to do that.	Tsy te hanao izany ianao.
I thought you weren’t real	Nieritreritra aho fa tsy tena ianao
He wanted to be alone.	Naniry ny ho irery izy.
I can tell, and he can tell	Afaka milaza aho, ary afaka milaza izy
I don't see what worked	Tsy hitako izay niasa
I have never thought that of other men	Mbola tsy nieritreritra an'izany momba ny lehilahy hafa aho
But someone else should do it.	Fa olona hafa no tokony hanao izany.
I don’t know how it will turn out this year.	Tsy haiko hoe hanao ahoana izany amin'ity taona ity.
I’m pretty sure we don’t have any	Tena azoko antoka fa tsy manana na inona na inona izahay
I don’t need a dog like that.	Tsy mila alika toy izany aho.
I never wanted a big house.	Tsy mba naniry trano lehibe mihitsy aho.
I'm glad you stayed here	Faly aho fa nijanona teto ianao
This is a crazy week.	Herinandro adala izao.
He decided to go.	Nanapa-kevitra ny handeha izy.
Not enough water.	Tsy ampy rano.
I don’t want to go without him	Tsy te handeha tsy misy azy aho
I live everywhere today.	Mipetraka amin'ny toerana rehetra aho amin'izao andro izao.
I don’t remember exactly how long maybe a few weeks	Tsy tadidiko tsara hoe hafiriana angamba ny herinandro vitsivitsy
I would be angry too.	Ho tezitra koa aho.
I know it and I know it.	Fantatro izany ary fantany izany.
No one heard anything.	Tsy nisy nandre na inona na inona.
He wants to get out.	Te hivoaka izy.
I really love you, and	Tena tiako ianao, ary
I was in this room, and shouldn’t have been there	Tao amin'ity efitrano ity aho, ary tsy tokony ho tao
But that's enough.	Fa ampy izay.
Otherwise, they will.	Raha tsy izany dia hanao izany izy ireo.
This is really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra ity.
No, stop, stop.	Tsia, mijanona, mijanona.
I knew he would come for me	Fantatro fa ho avy ho ahy izy
I think he wants to see you	Heveriko fa te hahita anao izy
No, he is not.	Tsia, tsy izy.
I can't think of anything else	Tsy afaka mieritreritra zavatra hafa aho
I will never do anything.	Tsy hanao na inona na inona mihitsy aho.
I saw that something was wrong	Hitako fa nisy zavatra tsy nety
And they are mine.	Ary ny ahy izy ireo.
I hope to be back tonight	Manantena aho fa hiverina anio alina
I hope you believe me	Manantena aho fa mino ahy ianao
He is right.	Marina ny azy.
I believe in him strongly	Mino azy mafy aho
I was expecting the former	Nanantena ny taloha aho
There is nothing left.	Tsy misy na inona na inona intsony.
So here it goes.	Koa izao no mandeha.
I think the paper is better than this	Heveriko fa tsara kokoa noho ity ny taratasy
There is no such thing.	Tsy misy zavatra mitovy amin'izany.
I don't need them now	Tsy mila azy ireo aho izao
I didn’t intend to stay	Tsy nikasa ny hijanona aho
He always did the same with children.	Nataony tamin’ny ankizy foana koa izany.
I couldn’t have done it faster	Tsy vitako haingana kokoa izany
He started it.	Izy no nanomboka.
They are both good.	Samy tsara izy ireo.
Everyone here is dead.	Maty daholo ny olona eto.
When it comes.	Rehefa tonga izany.
They are indeed alive.	Velona tokoa izy ireo.
I love him so much.	Tiako loatra izy.
Maybe he had to do it.	Angamba tsy maintsy nanao izany izy.
I know about that.	Fantatro ny momba izany.
A safe place.	Toerana azo antoka.
I wrote to him again and gave him information	Nanoratra azy indray aho ary nanome vaovao azy
At first they were very nice and helpful.	Tamin'ny voalohany dia tena tsara sy nanampy izy ireo.
You should go.	Tokony handeha ianao.
I did, a lot.	Nataoko, betsaka.
He didn’t like it.	Tsy tiany izany.
He really didn’t even know what it was.	Tena tsy fantany akory hoe inona ilay izy.
I want him for me	Tiako ho ahy izy
I understand that not everything is clear on paper	Azoko fa tsy mazava tsara amin'ny taratasy ny zavatra rehetra
It will be very easy.	Ho mora tokoa izany.
But only a little.	Saingy kely fotsiny.
This is not good.	Tsy tsara izany.
I’m glad no one stole it	Faly aho fa tsy nisy nangalatra izany
Any other day, it’s great and always.	Na inona na inona andro hafa, dia lehibe sy foana.
He still wanted to see her.	Mbola naniry ny hahita azy izy.
I stayed there for another two hours	Nijanona tao nandritra ny adiny roa indray aho
We bought a house.	Nividy trano izahay.
I will always be an outsider	Ho olona ivelany foana aho
I thought you might have said something to him	Nihevitra aho fa mety ho nilaza zavatra taminy ianao
Thank you for coming here tonight.	Misaotra anao tonga teto androany hariva.
In any case, they arrived at the scene.	Na ahoana na ahoana, dia tonga teo amin'ilay toerana izy ireo.
I told you to do something.	Nolazaiko anao hanao zavatra.
I was glad he was with me	Faly aho fa niaraka tamiko izy
That's not right.	Tsy mety izany.
It’s usually about the little things every day.	Matetika izany dia momba ny zavatra kely isan'andro.
All of these are problems.	Ireo rehetra ireo dia olana.
And he had an idea or two of his own.	Ary nanana hevitra iray na roa ho azy manokana izy.

He told her he was the ‘one’.	Nilaza taminy izy fa izy no 'iray'.
That was the end for me.	Izay no farany ho ahy.
He is not far from me.	Tsy lavitra ahy izy.
I was able to do that job.	Afaka nanao an'io asa io aho.
The reason is he did it before.	Ny antony dia nanao izany izy taloha.
I’m sure there are other reasons as well.	Azoko antoka fa misy antony hafa koa.
It is possible.	Azo atao izany.
I even made friends	Nahazo namana mihitsy aza aho
Here is another one.	Ity misy iray hafa.
It was wrong.	Tsy nety izany.
I want to be like that	Te ho toy izany aho
I want to be there, when you do.	Te ho any aho, rehefa manao izany ianao.
And he is.	Ary izy no .
I had nothing to worry about now	Tsy nanana na inona na inona ho sahirana aho izao
This is the real idea here.	Io no tena hevitra eto.
They are all ugly, in fact.	Izy rehetra dia ratsy tarehy, raha ny marina.
I made this picture.	Izaho no nanao an'io sary io.
This is only the first reason.	Antony voalohany ihany izany.
I'm sure he's not even thirty yet	Azoko antoka fa mbola tsy telopolo akory izy
We hope you like it !.	Manantena izahay fa tianao izany!.
Then you came to us.	Dia tonga teto aminay ianao.
I love that about it.	Tiako izany momba izany.
I don’t want to be loved or for her	Tsy te ho tia na ho azy aho
He understands why and ignores it.	Azony ny antony ary tsy miraharaha izany.
I want him alive if possible	Tiako ho velona izy raha azo atao
I love learning this way	Tiako ny mianatra amin'ity fomba ity
You are easy, fast and hard.	Mora, haingana ary mafy ianao.
I believe in great ways	Mino ny fomba lehibe aho
Some don’t care.	Misy tsy miraharaha.
I'll see if then	Ho hitako izany raha izany
Don't be afraid of him.	Aza matahotra azy.
He was a good man to be there.	Lehilahy tsara tokony ho eo izy.
He can't either.	Tsy afaka koa izy.
It was a wonderful time	Fotoana nahafinaritra izany
The girl does that.	Manao izany ilay tovovavy.
I don't see that time	Tsy hitako izay fotoana
Don't worry.	Aza manahy.
That was the last time.	Izay no fotoana farany.
I would love to help you	Tiako ny manampy anao
No, you didn't.	Tsia, tsy nanao izany ianao.
I was not wrong	Tsy nisy diso aho
I should be a good woman, but for you	Tokony ho vehivavy tsara aho, fa ho anao
I don't want you to leave	Tsy tiako hiala ianao
I asked if it was sick	Nanontany aho raha marary ilay izy
He really wanted to hear about it.	Tena te hahazo teny izy momba an'io.
I can see why he loves it so much	Hitako hoe nahoana izy io no tena tiany
I don't need it.	Tsy mila izany aho.
He is a very good man.	Lehilahy tena tsara izy.
I don't want to be alone	Tsy te ho irery aho
Kind of like me.	Karazana tahaka ahy.
It's fast.	Haingana izany.
It is early in the morning.	Vao maraina be ny andro.
It was like we had a lot of friends.	Toy ny hoe nanana namana maro izahay.
He was few when he was young.	Vitsivitsy izy fony mbola kely.
I thought no one would be there	Nihevitra aho fa tsy hisy olona ho eo
I still had problems.	Mbola nanana olana aho.
I wouldn’t like that	Tsy ho tiako izany
The questions are all the same.	Mitovy daholo ny fanontaniana.
I never knew what it was	Tsy hitako mihitsy hoe inona ilay izy
I was too busy to think about it	Sahirana loatra aho ka tsy nieritreritra an'izany
They died well.	Maty tsara izy ireo.
I remember that very well	Tadidiko tsara izany
I'm still here.	Mbola eto aho.
Then you have no luck.	Dia tsy manana vintana ianao.
I would be happy if that was the case	Ho faly aho raha izany no izy
I can tell if I look at you	Afaka milaza aho raha mijery anao
There was never such a thing.	Tsy nisy toy izany mihitsy.
I know this time is good.	Fantatro fa tsara ity fotoana ity.
And in a few places it still exists.	Ary amin'ny toerana vitsivitsy dia mbola misy izany.
I want to tell you	Te hilaza aminao aho
Maybe the old story is better	Angamba tsara kokoa ny tantara taloha
I tried to talk, but I couldn’t understand the word	Niezaka niresaka aho, saingy tsy azoko ilay teny
I saw him this afternoon	Hitako izy androany tolakandro
I think it’s different.	Heveriko fa hafa izany.
I spent some time looking at them	Nandany fotoana kely aho nijery azy ireo
I don’t think it’s where it should be.	Heveriko fa tsy any amin'ny toerana tokony hisy azy izany.
I think we had a great time together	Heveriko fa nahafinaritra anay ny niaraka
It’s just like you.	Tahaka anao ihany izany.
Nothing bad happened.	Tsy nisy ratsy nitranga.
I couldn't think of anything else	Tsy afaka nieritreritra zavatra hafa aho
A man may do worse.	Mety hanao ratsy kokoa ny lehilahy iray.
I don't remember him	Tsy tadidiko izy
Where you can always get it.	Any amin'ny toerana mety ho azonao foana.
Yes, only one.	Eny, iray ihany tokoa.
I know he is much more than that	Fantatro fa mihoatra lavitra noho izany izy
These can be good or bad.	Mety ho tsara na ratsy ireo.
And it’s not easy.	Ary tsy mora izany.
Two things work there.	Zavatra roa no miasa any.
But that's all you get now.	Fa izay ihany no azonao amin'izao.
I see it more often now.	Hitako matetika kokoa izany ankehitriny.
The girls expected that.	Nanantena izany ireo tovovavy.
If anything, it’s even worse.	Raha misy, dia ratsy kokoa izany.
No, not often.	Tsia, tsy matetika.
It then becomes more difficult and even more difficult.	Lasa sarotra kokoa izany avy eo ary mbola sarotra kokoa.
Little did he know that he was angry.	Tsy fantany fa tezitra izy.
Then we eat.	Dia mihinana izahay.
I have never seen it before	Tsy mbola nijery an'izany mihitsy aho
I got back in the car	Niverina tao anaty fiara aho
I don't understand what the problem is.	Tsy azoko hoe inona no olana.
I told him we had been together for a week	Nolazaiko taminy fa niaraka nandritra ny herinandro izahay
I won't be able to see him	Tsy ho afaka hahita azy aho
I talked to him yesterday	Niresaka taminy aho omaly
You did nothing.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona ianao.
With the next.	Miaraka amin'ny manaraka.
I just don’t know what that reason is	Tsy fantatro fotsiny hoe inona izany antony izany
So more than one person had information.	Noho izany dia nisy olona mihoatra ny iray nanana vaovao.
Finally, they got the news.	Farany dia nahazo ny vaovao izy ireo.
Any woman has done the same.	Na iza na iza vehivavy dia nanao toy izany koa.
The next car was another nice guy.	Ny fiara manaraka dia lehilahy mahafinaritra iray hafa.
We both sit in our respective movies.	Samy mipetraka amin'ny sarimihetsika misy azy avy isika.
I tried hard	Niezaka mafy aho
But you don’t have to play.	Saingy tsy mila milalao ianao.
The house was nice.	Tsara ny tao an-trano.
They are leaving me now.	Efa miala amiko izy ireo izao.
He is gone.	Lasa izy.
Maybe he just had to buy time.	Angamba tsy maintsy nividy fotoana fotsiny izy.
But he is not alive.	Nefa tsy velona izy.
I walk a lot during the day.	Mandeha be aho mandritra ny andro.
I hope you can help me with that	Manantena aho fa afaka manampy ahy amin'izany ianao
And everything seemed to go well.	Ary toa nandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
I didn’t make a fool of myself	Tsy nanao adala aho
Like a father should.	Toy ny tokony ho ray.
I'm not sure what to do about it	Tsy azoko antoka izay tokony hatao amin'izany
But no, it’s too big for me.	Saingy tsia, lehibe loatra izany raha tsy ho ahy.
But this is not the case with other patients.	Saingy tsy izany no nitranga tamin'ny marary hafa.
And apologize for what happened.	Ary miala tsiny amin'ny zava-nitranga.
Or almost as good.	Na saika tsara ihany.
I wondered if it was.	Nanontany tena aho raha azy io.
This is still not entirely believable.	Mbola tsy tena azo inoana izany.
That’s because of me.	Izany dia noho izaho.
Whether they like it or not.	Na tiany na tsy tiany.
Maybe you can get something else out of him.	Angamba mety hahazo zavatra hafa avy aminy ianao.
I still think that's true.	Mbola heveriko fa marina izany.
I remember the first time.	Tadidiko ny fotoana voalohany.
I'm not mad at him.	Tsy tezitra aminy aho.
I know what they are	Fantatro hoe inona izy ireo
She loves her new self.	Tiany ny tenany vaovao.
I stay outside all night	Mijanona any ivelany mandritra ny alina aho
Other places and times, yes.	Toerana sy fotoana hafa, eny.
I love reading stories	Tiako ny mamaky ny tantara
I'm not completely happy	Tsy faly tanteraka aho
I knew he would be there	Fantatro fa ho eo izy
More than anything else, he wanted to see her again.	Mihoatra noho ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia naniry ny hahita azy indray izy.
Yes, he did.	Eny, nanao izany izy.
I'm not too happy	Tsy dia faly loatra aho
I really don't know what to do.	Tena tsy hitako izay hatao.
Probably never.	Mety tsy hisy mihitsy.
Worked for a few weeks now.	Niasa nandritra ny herinandro vitsivitsy izao.
There they are looking for money.	Eo izy ireo mitady vola.
I love children.	Tiako ny ankizy.
And it was still there.	Ary mbola teo ihany.
It’s a wonderful story.	Tantara mahafinaritra io.
I hope you have the same problem as us.	Manantena aho fa manana olana mitovy aminay ianao.
And I need it.	Ary mila izany aho.
i get it too	azoko koa izany
When we talk, it may come back.	Rehefa miresaka isika dia mety hiverina izany.
I couldn’t do something like that	Tsy afaka nanao zavatra toy izany aho
I talked to him recently	Niresaka taminy aho vao haingana
A man was standing not far from us	Nisy lehilahy iray nijanona tsy lavitra anay
Neither of us said that.	Samy tsy nisy nilaza an'izany izahay.
I do not intend to stay	Tsy mikasa ny hijanona aho
I never understood why	Tsy azoko mihitsy ny antony
I really didn't want to do that to you	Tena tsy nety nataoko taminao
It didn’t go well.	Tsy nandeha tsara izany.
Men.	Lehilahy.
He went faster.	Nandeha haingana kokoa izy.

You don’t have to.	Tsy voatery ianao.
He will go because he is the only one who can.	Handeha izy satria izy irery no afaka.
You need to do something about it.	Mila manao zavatra amin'izany ianao.
For real.	Tena izy.
I didn't play	Tsy nilalao aho

Nothing can be made so clear here.	Tsy misy azo atao mazava toy izany eto.
I didn’t ask for them.	Tsy nangataka azy ireo aho.
Whatever, just say it.	Na inona na inona dia lazao fotsiny.
I tried to look at him	Niezaka nijery azy aho
I want to stay with me	Tiako ny hijanona amiko
It is ready to go.	Efa vonona handeha izany.
I could see it clearly as the day	Hitako mazava toy ny andro izany
Here and now.	Eto ary ankehitriny.
Many people talk about themselves like that.	Maro ny olona miresaka momba ny tenany toy izany.
I like to have more than one	Tiako ny manana mihoatra ny iray
It was not easy to find.	Tsy mora ny nahita izany.
No, you can't do that.	Tsia, tsy afaka manao izany ianao.
The same is true.	Marina koa izany.
Or the truth is not.	Na ny marina dia tsy izany.
Sounds fun.	Toa mahafinaritra.
I couldn't do that	Tsy afaka nanao izany aho
I quickly looked at the other houses	Nijery haingana ny trano hafa aho
Can you tell me how to do it, please.	Azonao atao ve ny milaza amiko ny fomba hanaovana izany, azafady.
Two things come up.	Ny zavatra roa tonga.
It seems impossible.	Toa tsy azo atao izany.
Which may be true.	Izay mety ho marina.
I'm not sure if it's true.	Tsy azoko antoka raha marina ilay izy.

It’s not the same for me.	Tsy mitovy amiko izany.
I see them everywhere	Hitako na aiza na aiza izy ireo
I wish he wasn’t there	Naniry aho fa tsy teo izy
She was the only woman with him.	Izy irery no vehivavy niaraka taminy.
I wonder if he is new	Manontany tena aho raha vaovao izy
We don’t think so.	Tsy mihevitra izany izahay.
I just didn’t need it	Tsy nila izany fotsiny aho
And yes, he knows.	Ary eny, fantany.
But you have to do something for me first.	Fa tsy maintsy manao zavatra ho ahy aloha ianao.
I tried to stay unafraid	Niezaka nijanona tsy natahotra aho
He does the same.	Manao toy izany koa izy.
I didn’t think he was coming anytime soon	Tsy noheveriko fa ho avy haingana izy
There were girls and women.	Nisy tovovavy sy vehivavy.

And when that day comes.	Ary rehefa tonga izany andro izany.

I can't wait any longer	Tsy afaka miandry intsony aho

So what do you want to happen.	Ka inona no tianao hitranga.

I was waiting for someone like you	Niandry olona toa anao aho
Not making money for us.	Tsy mitady vola ho antsika.
It’s like you can’t talk about it.	Toy ny hoe tsy afaka miresaka momba izany ianao.
I became close to him.	Lasa akaiky azy aho.

I started getting more information	Nanomboka nahazo vaovao bebe kokoa aho
The baby is a few days old.	Andro vitsivitsy ny zaza.
I couldn’t work hard or fast	Tsy afaka niasa mafy na haingana aho
I just want you to love me	Tiako ho tia ahy fotsiny ianao
Within a week, he was dead.	Tao anatin'ny herinandro dia maty izy.
They shouldn’t do that.	Tsy tokony hanao izany izy ireo.
We hope you don’t get the chance to see it.	Manantena izahay fa tsy hahazo ny fahafahana hahita izany ianao.
Neither do I.	Izaho koa tsy.
It was just the wrong morning.	Vao maraina diso izany.
I think it wants to leave.	Heveriko fa te hiala izy io.
I know it's not the same as the people here	Fantatro fa tsy mitovy amin’ny olona eto izany
The day has been like that.	Efa toy izany ny andro.
I will know.	ho fantatro.
Her heart went out to him.	Nankany aminy ny fony.
I never said another word	Tsy niteny teny hafa mihitsy aho
I was not afraid of anything	Tsy natahotra na inona na inona aho
Or he might take you to him.	Na mety hitondra anao any aminy izy.
We are here to do the latter.	Tonga eto izahay hanao ity farany.
That's it.	Izany no azy.
Even worse, tell her you love her.	Na ny ratsy kokoa aza dia lazao aminy fa tiany izy.
Great time.	Fotoana tena tsara.
I think he’s a little scared to see you here	Heveriko fa somary matahotra izy ny hahita anao eto
And tonight he saw me.	Ary izao hariva izao dia nahita ahy izy.
This is not true now.	Tsy marina izany ankehitriny.
There are many ways to do this.	Misy fomba maro hanaovana izany.
I went in there once, I didn’t like it	Niditra tao indray mandeha aho, tsy tiako
He kept trying.	Nanandrana hatrany izy.
It is very difficult to do so.	Tena sarotra ny manao izany.
However, time also passed for them.	Na izany aza, dia nandeha ihany koa ny fotoana ho azy ireo.
This is because it is not enough.	Izany dia satria tsy ampy izany.
You just have to have them.	Mila manana azy ireo fotsiny ianao.
I didn’t try to be difficult	Tsy niezaka ny ho sarotra aho
Not at all.	Tsia kosa.
I’m ready to go out every day	Vonona ny hivoaka isan'andro aho
I think this is a first for me	Heveriko fa ity no voalohany ho ahy
I'll be home tomorrow and we'll talk later	Hody aho rahampitso dia hiresaka isika avy eo
Tell me what you think about it.	Lazao ahy ny hevitrao momba izany.
I needed to work.	Nila niasa aho.
I’m not telling you what to do.	Tsy milaza aminao izay tokony hatao aho.
They don’t care.	Tsy miraharaha izay izy ireo.
Maybe I should go	Tokony handeha angamba aho
He had been away for about a week, but now he was back.	Efa herinandro teo ho eo izy no tsy tao, saingy niverina izao.
I will leave you	hiala aminao aho
I think you have to go	Heveriko fa tsy maintsy mandeha ianao
I am a different person	Olona hafa aho
Not like himself.	Tsy tahaka ny tenany.
I don’t remember anything at all	Tsy tadidiko na inona na inona mihitsy
I read a book recently	Namaky boky aho vao haingana
Of course not anymore.	Mazava ho azy fa tsy izany intsony.
This is the worst way.	Izany no fomba ratsy indrindra.
I didn’t think you were the type	Tsy noheveriko fa ianao no karazana
There are no patients.	Tsy misy marary.
I see it almost every day.	Saika isan'andro no hitako.
In fact, he had a great time.	Raha ny marina dia nanana fotoana nahafinaritra izy.
We must do good things.	Tsy maintsy manao zavatra tsara isika.
I don't read it.	Tsy mamaky azy aho.
I'll see you there, soon	Mahita anao any aho, tsy ho ela
I will see.	ho hitako.
He really needs style.	Tena mila fomba izy.
That is not enough.	Tsy ampy izany.
I hope we will meet soon	Mino aho fa hihaona tsy ho ela isika
I should come see him soon	Tokony ho avy hahita azy aho tsy ho ela
I didn’t need music now	Tsy nila mozika aho izao
It could not have happened.	Tsy nety ho nitranga izany.
I don’t work like that.	Tsy miasa toy izany aho.
He knew what it was.	Fantany hoe inona izany.
I didn’t ask him about things for me	Tsy nanontany azy momba ny zavatra ho ahy aho
It’s hard to say exactly how.	Sarotra ny milaza marina hoe ahoana.
Are you free.	Afaka ve ianao.
He won't be long.	Tsy ho ela izy.
I couldn’t figure out why	Tsy afaka nieritreritra aho hoe nahoana
I came with him	Tonga niaraka taminy aho
And he sat there.	Dia nipetraka teo izy.
You both like it.	Samy tianao.
We decided to take him out.	Nanapa-kevitra izahay fa hitondra azy hivoaka.
I do a job I love now	Manao asa tiako aho izao
There is no question.	Tsy misy fanontaniana.
You never understand me.	Tsy azonao mihitsy aho.
I'm sorry it's bad	Miala tsiny aho fa ratsy
And he didn't.	Ary tsy nanao izany izy.
The same goes for the players.	Toy izany koa ny mpilalao.
You will come in tomorrow.	Hiditra ianao rahampitso.
I wanted to never look at me again	Naniry aho mba tsy hijery ahy intsony
This is never the case in today’s books.	Tsy izany na oviana na oviana ao amin'ny boky ankehitriny.
I think you have to believe that.	Heveriko fa tsy maintsy mino izany ianao.
No, it's easier.	Tsia, mora kokoa izany.
If you want to learn.	Raha te hianatra ianao.
But you know the type.	Fa fantatrao ny karazana.
Not going well.	Tsy mandeha tsara.
He does it because that is what it should be done.	Manao izany izy satria izany no tokony hatao.
And he asked him to bring her.	Dia nangataka taminy izy mba hitondra azy.
We had to do it over and over again	Tsy maintsy nanao izany hatrany hatrany izahay
I wanted to be the first for him	Naniry ny ho voalohany ho azy aho
I don’t want to see you follow the same path	Tsy tiako ny mahita anao manaraka io lalana io ihany
That says something clearly.	Izany dia milaza zavatra mazava.
If it’s bigger than this, it’s better.	Raha lehibe noho ity dia tsara kokoa.
You are alive.	Velona ianao.
You never get there.	Tsy tonga any mihitsy ianao.
This is not new.	Tsy vaovao izany.
Something that must be done.	Zavatra tsy maintsy atao.
Not that he needs it.	Tsy hoe mila izany izy.
I don't know why he's here	Tsy haiko hoe nahoana izy no eto
Say three days.	Lazao hoe telo andro.
And he returned.	Dia niverina izy.
I ask where that place is.	Manontany aho hoe aiza io toerana io.
Many others went with him	Olona maro hafa koa no niaraka taminy
But it’s not over yet.	Saingy tsy mbola tanteraka.
And not in a good way either.	Ary tsy amin'ny fomba tsara koa.
This man is dead.	Efa maty io lehilahy io.
Like there is no house.	Toy ny tsy misy trano.
I enjoyed being with him.	Nahafinaritra ahy ny niaraka taminy.
Where it is located.	Aiza no misy azy.
He told her that maybe she should go home	Nilaza taminy izy fa tokony hody angamba izy
I haven't seen anything yet	Mbola tsy nahita na inona na inona aho
He said nothing had happened.	Nilaza izy fa tsy nisy na inona na inona nitranga tamin’izany.
I almost never saw it.	Saika tsy hitako mihitsy ilay izy.
He went out and came in.	Nivoaka izy ary niditra.
I just want you to love me	Tiako ho tia ahy fotsiny ianao
Anyway, it’s nice to talk to you.	Na izany na tsy izany, mahafinaritra ny miresaka aminao.
I really had no reason to be there	Tena tsy nanana antony tokony ho any aho
I really watch the evening news often.	Tena mijery ny vaovao hariva aho matetika.
There was not much of that here.	Tsy dia nisy an'izany teto.
Maybe this might go somewhere.	Angamba mety handeha ho aiza ity.
You know this one.	Fantatrao ity iray ity.
It couldn’t have been better.	Tsy nety ho tsara kokoa izany.
Nothing to do.	Tsy misy atao.
Yes and far.	Eny ary lavitra.
These are my favorite people.	Ireo no olona tiako indrindra.
I'm glad you're back	Faly aho fa niverina ianao
This is not possible.	Tsy azo atao izany.
Who else is his.	Iza koa ny azy.
I did nothing wrong	Tsy nanao ratsy aho
This is very different.	Tena hafa mihitsy izao.
They did not need him to tell them what to do.	Tsy nila azy hilaza izay tokony hataony izy ireo.
Tell me if this is right or wrong.	Lazao ahy raha mety io na tsy mety.
I want it to be perfect	Tiako ho tanteraka izany
I will make time.	Hanao fotoana aho.
I didn't even want to.	Tsy naniry akory aho.
I didn’t think they would have said much to me	Tsy noheveriko fa ho nilaza zavatra betsaka tamiko izy ireo
I have three reasons	Manana antony telo aho
I'm sorry you lost it.	Miala tsiny aho fa very azy ianao.
I know this place	Fantatro ity toerana ity
Sorry to ask him here.	Miala tsiny fa nanontany azy eto.
He needs a place.	Mila toerana misy azy izy.
No one is better than the two of you.	Tsy misy mihoatra noho ianareo roa.
The worst thing that could happen.	Ny zavatra ratsy indrindra mety hitranga.
But I went first.	Fa izaho no nandeha voalohany.
Home from home.	Trano avy any an-trano.
He can do more.	Afaka manao bebe kokoa izy.
You and I are not dead.	Tsy maty izahay sy ianao.
They never returned.	Tsy niverina intsony izy ireo.
He just stopped.	Nijanona fotsiny izy.
I sleep at night anxiously.	Matory aho amin'ny alina manahy.
Or there is a possible way.	Na misy fomba azo atao.
It was really big.	Lehibe tokoa ilay izy.
Although it has gone a long way.	Na dia efa lasa lavitra aza izany.
Then next.	Dia manaraka.
Especially at the high end.	Indrindra fa amin'ny farany ambony.
I'm not there.	tsy misy aho.
Didn't even hear it.	Tsy nandre izany akory.
It might work.	Mety miasa izany.
He was just like me.	Tahaka ahy ihany izy.
Or maybe he just wants to get it done.	Na angamba tiany ho vita izany.
However, you never know.	Na izany aza, tsy fantatrao mihitsy.
They are watching us.	Mijery antsika izy ireo.
I've been away for a week	Efa nandeha herinandro aho
I haven't got any good news for you yet	Mbola tsy nahazo vaovao tsara ho anao aho
I should be like that, but the money won’t stop, anyway	Tokony ho toy izany aho, saingy tsy hijanona ny vola, na ahoana na ahoana
He is also busy.	Sahirana koa izy.
The old one.	Ilay izy taloha.
You have come to the right place.	Tonga amin'ny toerana mety ianao.
I've been wanting to tell you that for a long time.	Efa ela aho no te hilaza aminao izany.
Sleep now.	Matory izao.
He had to try again.	Tsy maintsy nanandrana indray izy.
We have been together for a long time.	Efa ela be izahay.
He probably didn't remember anything.	Tsy nahatsiaro na inona na inona angamba izy.
Others wait too long.	Ny hafa miandry ela loatra.
I didn’t tell him what else was done	Tsy nolazaiko azy ny zavatra hafa vita
I often had it all	Matetika aho no nanana izany rehetra izany
That may be true.	Marina angamba izany.
I really struggle reading something like this	Tena sahirana aho mamaky zavatra toy izao
I can't seem to find it	Toa tsy hitako ilay izy
It's the same with you.	Mitovy amin’ny aminao koa izany.
I didn’t see it right away.	Tsy hitako avy hatrany izany.
Now is not the time to act.	Tsy fotoana hanaovana asa izao.
I was confused as to why	Very hevitra aho hoe nahoana
He’s better than that.	Tsara kokoa noho izany izy.
I am angry with him.	Tezitra aminy aho.
I asked what was true.	Nanontany aho hoe inona no marina.
Then they left.	Dia lasa izy ireo.
I just have the space	Manana ny toerana fotsiny aho
I'm in the first hour.	Amin'ny ora voalohany aho.
I know you have a good idea	Fantatro fa tsara ny hevitrao
You better go.	Aleo mandeha ianao.
We worked hard for him.	Niasa mafy azy izahay.
I'm not really sure.	Tsy tena azoko antoka.
Of course he did.	Mazava ho azy fa nanao izany izy.
I went out.	Nivoaka aho.
This may not be true for two reasons.	Mety tsy ho marina izany noho ny antony roa.
Months at most.	Volana raha be indrindra.
We will still live.	Mbola ho velona isika.
I pretend to be asleep	Mody matory aho
I see it, now, because you left	Hitako izany, ankehitriny, satria niala ianao
I haven’t seen anything like it in years	Tsy nahita zavatra toy izany aho nandritra ny taona maro
This information is completely wrong.	Diso tanteraka izany vaovao izany.
Friendly money.	Vola namana.
I didn't need friends	Tsy nila namana aho
But that person is coming.	Fa ho avy io olona io.
I hope you are sure of that.	Manantena aho fa azonao antoka izany.
I looked at him	Nijery azy aho
I was able to make him unconscious	Afaka nanao azy tsy nahatsiaro tena aho
I didn’t like it when he did	Tsy tiako izany rehefa nanao izany izy
I could see them clearly	Hitako mazava tsara izy ireo
I wondered who did it	Nanontany tena aho hoe iza no nanao izany
Something was going to happen.	Nisy zavatra hitranga.
He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.	Teo amin’ny toerana tsy mety tamin’ny fotoana tsy nety izy.
I could have had it with him	Afaka nanana izany niaraka taminy aho
I have never played	Tsy mbola nilalao mihitsy aho
I really don’t remember	Tena tsy tadidiko
It has to.	Tsy maintsy izy io.
I need to think carefully	Mila mieritreritra tsara aho
I don't know anything about it.	Tsy mahalala na inona na inona momba an'io aho.
This is very hard to believe	Tena sarotra inoana izany
When it’s done, you’ll know it’s done.	Rehefa vita dia ho fantatrao fa vita izany.
Very nice guy.	Lehilahy tena mahafinaritra.
We are not from anywhere in particular.	Tsy avy aiza manokana izahay.
Or it doesn’t work.	Na tsy miasa izany.
However, it seems so, but in fact it is not.	Na izany aza, toa toy izany, fa raha ny marina dia tsy izany.
There are so many of them.	Be dia be izy ireo.
I just had a question.	Nanana fanontaniana fotsiny aho.
We got dressed.	Nanao akanjo izahay.
The woman died.	Maty ilay vehivavy.
I know you don’t get any new help here.	Fantatro fa tsy mahazo fanampiana vaovao ianao eto.
Nothing will happen to you here.	Tsy hisy na inona na inona hitranga aminao eto.
I never understood why that was.	Tsy azoko mihitsy ny antony nahatonga izany.
It's back now.	Niverina izany izao.
Sure, sure, it has to.	Azo antoka, azo antoka, tsy maintsy izany.
I want to see it	Te hahita izany aho
A teacher helped a student nearby.	Nisy mpampianatra nanampy mpianatra iray teo akaiky teo.
I might be home soon	Mety hody tsy ho ela aho
I wanted to see him	Naniry ny hahita azy aho
He started coming back.	Nanomboka niverina izy.
I don’t know why that happened	Tsy fantatro ny antony nahatonga izany
Or for some other reason.	Na noho ny antony hafa.
That is true.	Marina izany.
But no one made it a problem.	Saingy tsy nisy nanao izany ho olana.
We won’t talk about that.	Tsy hiresaka momba izany izahay.
I am no longer a child	Tsy zaza intsony aho
I will become a teacher	Ho lasa mpampianatra aho
It doesn’t have to be like us.	Tsy voatery ho toa antsika.
He will get nothing.	Tsy hahazo na inona na inona izy.
This will be done.	Izany no hatao.
And he seems to be coming back again.	Ary toa mbola hiverina indray izy.
People seem to love him.	Toa tia azy ny olona.
I’m more than happy that they came here	Faly kokoa aho fa tonga eto izy ireo
It’s really hard.	Tena sarotra izany.
I did not go alone	Tsy nandeha irery aho
I’m pretty sure you won’t like it	Saika azoko antoka fa tsy ho tianao izany
I think it works better now.	Heveriko fa miasa tsara kokoa izao.
I want to see you coming	Te hahita anao ho avy aho
I'm so happy for you friends	Tena faly ho anao aho ry namana
It’s a long way from the past, but it’s a real player	Dia lavitra taloha, fa tena mpilalao

They are very good.	Tena tsara izy ireo.
If he was wrong, he kept trying.	Raha diso izy, dia niezaka hatrany.
The good news is we found something really fun.	Ny vaovao tsara dia nahita zavatra tena mahafinaritra izahay.
I haven’t done that in a long time.	Efa ela be aho no tsy nanao izany.
I don’t know if he heard me	Tsy fantatro raha nandre ahy izy
I just got word	Vao nahazo teny aho
The time is very near now.	Tena akaiky ny fotoana ankehitriny.
I had to apologize to him	Tsy maintsy niala tsiny taminy aho
Eventually, he made a face.	Rehefa ela ny ela dia nanao tarehy izy.
I talked about a lot of things	Niresaka zavatra maro aho
I think he is there now	Heveriko fa eo izy izao
He didn’t even know there was one.	Mbola tsy fantany akory hoe nisy na iray aza.
He is better or better than them.	Tsara na tsara kokoa noho izy ireo izy.
And even if you did, you wouldn’t get it.	Ary na dia nanao izany aza ianao, dia tsy ho azonao.
I’m sure they can do it	Azoko antoka fa afaka manao izany izy ireo
We are in a good time now.	Ao anatin'ny fotoana tsara isika izao.
I am the surest.	Izaho no azo antoka indrindra.
Even if you want to, you can’t die.	Na tianao aza dia tsy mety maty ianao.
I am still a child	Mbola zaza ihany koa aho
There are no more questions about them.	Tsy misy fanontaniana momba azy ireo intsony.
I didn’t get anything overnight	Tsy nahazo na inona na inona aho nandritra ny alina
And there they were.	Ary teo izy ireo.
I hope they are happy.	Manantena aho fa faly izy ireo.
He might do that.	Mety hanao izany izy.
I didn’t eat anything either	Tsy nihinana na inona na inona koa aho
Now he can’t say you haven’t tried.	Ankehitriny dia tsy afaka milaza izy fa tsy nanandrana ianao.
Not a little, actually.	Tsy dia kely, raha ny marina.
I think you are not right	Heveriko fa tsy marina ianao
Not just men.	Tsy lehilahy fotsiny.
We need to find the place.	Mila mitady ny toerana isika.
Or he may have.	Na mety manana izy.
Of course we went.	Mazava ho azy fa nandeha izahay.
I can't stay up all night	Tsy afaka mijanona alina aho
People started getting nice clothes.	Nanomboka nahazo akanjo tsara tarehy ny olona.
I was scared.	Natahotra aho.
No, I guess you don’t.	Tsia, heveriko fa tsy manao izany ianao.
I can't be with you anymore	Tsy afaka miaraka aminao intsony aho
And he will do the same.	Ary hanao izany koa izy.
I told him that	Nolazaiko tamiko izany
The two of us.	Isika roa.
She has no husband.	Tsy manana lehilahy izy.
I'm still fine.	Mbola tsara ihany aho.
When you have too much, you become something else.	Rehefa manana zavatra be loatra ianao dia lasa zavatra hafa.
Only one thing.	Zavatra iray ihany.
In fact, he didn’t even know it.	Raha ny marina dia tsy fantany akory izany.
I was so scared to meet him	Tena natahotra aho nihaona taminy
There were no children in the area.	Tsy nisy ankizy tao amin’ilay toerana.
We did nothing.	Tsy nanao na inona na inona izahay.
I really like going now.	Tena tiako ny mandeha izao.
I used to be very selfish	Tena tia tena aho taloha
I won't look at him.	Tsy hijery azy aho.
And of course that is what it is.	Ary mazava ho azy fa izany no izy.
I was happy for him and told him so	Faly ho azy aho ary nilaza izany taminy
I will get there, eventually.	Ho tonga any aho, amin'ny farany.
I don't know if that's a problem.	Tsy haiko raha olana izany.
I couldn't want anything else	Tsy afaka naniry zavatra hafa intsony aho
And he.	Ary izy.
Yes, he slept well.	Eny, natory tsara izy.
No, worse than that.	Tsia, ratsy noho izany.
I thought he would be here	Nihevitra aho fa ho eto izy
I didn’t even know it was possible	Tsy fantatro akory hoe azo atao izany
I didn’t know he was there	Tsy fantatro fa teo izy
I can't do anything for you today	Tsy afaka manao na inona na inona ho anao aho anio
I have already done so	Efa nanao izany aho
Maybe you watch too many movies, who knows.	Angamba ianao mijery sarimihetsika be loatra, iza no mahalala.
I don't know what to do about it.	Tsy hitako izay hatao amin'izany.
He already knew it had to be.	Efa fantany fa tsy maintsy ho izany.
I wore anything	Nanao akanjo na inona na inona aho
It was fun to leave.	Nahafinaritra ny niala.
No one was free.	Tsy nisy olona afaka.
I was really surprised that he was still with me	Tena gaga aho fa mbola miaraka amiko izy
But it went.	Saingy nandeha izany.
No one had to say that at all.	Tsy nisy olona voatery nilaza izany mihitsy.
I love the place on this one	Tiako ny toerana amin'ity
It was there, full stuff.	Teo ihany ilay izy, zavatra feno.
It’s really fun.	Tena mahafinaritra izany.
I know.	Fantatro.
How is that.	Ahoana izany.
He didn’t get one either.	Tsy nahazo iray koa izy.
I love being with him	Tiako ny miaraka aminy
You have an idea of ​​how you are, how you are.	Manana hevitra hoe manao ahoana ianao, manao ahoana ianao.
Please say it's okay to do this.	Mba lazao fa tsy maninona ny manao an'io.
That might be enough.	Mety ho ampy izay.
I just didn’t think about it	Tsy nieritreritra an'izany fotsiny aho
It's the same.	Toy izany ihany.
When will they return.	Rahoviana izy ireo no hiverina.
I see no reason not to do that	Tsy hitako izay antony tsy hanaovana izany
I asked him where the food was	Nanontany azy aho hoe aiza ny sakafo
As for him, they are not.	Raha ny momba azy dia tsy izy ireo.
So it was fun.	Ka dia nahafinaritra.
I looked away	Nijery lavitra aho
I heard him, but he seemed far away	Nandre azy aho, saingy toa lavitra izy
He still is.	Mbola izy.
Who else could he be.	Iza koa no mety ho izy.
I needed to see him first	Nila nahita azy aloha aho
I decided they weren’t	Nanapa-kevitra aho fa tsy izy ireo
These guys are almost impossible to finish.	Saika tsy ho vita mihitsy ireo lehilahy ireo.
This is very untrue.	Tena tsy marina izany.
I don’t want that to happen.	Tsy tiako hitranga izany.
He is not alone when he is alone.	Tsy irery izy rehefa irery.
A lot started here.	Betsaka no nanomboka teto.
I really didn’t think so	Tena tsy noheveriko izany
I get away with it	miala amin'izany aho
Don’t worry if you have.	Aza manahy raha manana ianao.
Then this is the only question.	Dia ity ihany no fanontaniana.
I make it like mine.	Ataoko toy ny ahy ilay izy.
I wasn’t there and no one told me much	Tsy teo aho ary tsy nisy nilaza tamiko betsaka
I never will, but I’m right for you	Tsy ho na oviana na oviana aho, fa marina aminao
But to me.	Fa amiko.
I plan to add to that, maybe a lot	Mikasa ny hanampy an'izany aho, mety ho betsaka
I'm lost now.	Very aho izao.
Because it doesn’t matter.	Satria tsy maninona izany.
I remember, this other guy	Tadidiko, ity lehilahy hafa ity
They are looking for money.	Mitady vola izy ireo.
I'll get in early tomorrow.	Hiditra aloha aho rahampitso.
You have to help him.	Tsy maintsy manampy azy ianao.
A month ago.	Iray volana lasa izay.
He didn't go well.	Tsy nandeha tsara izy.
The next minute is all gone.	Ny minitra manaraka dia samy lasa.
I was afraid you wouldn’t get it	Natahotra aho sao tsy ho azonao
Lots of pictures.	Betsaka ny sary.
I had to have help.	Tsy maintsy nanana fanampiana aho.
I really thought it was you	Tena noheveriko fa ianao io
They never asked.	Tsy nanontany mihitsy izy ireo.
That's how it should be.	Izany no tokony ho izy.
And we’ve found a way before.	Ary efa nahita fomba izahay taloha.
Finally he was gone.	Farany dia lasa izy.
He asked her.	Nangataka azy izy.
I think he’s going really well	Heveriko fa tena mandeha tsara izy
That's really good.	Tena tsara izany.
But we were terrified.	Saingy natahotra mafy izahay.
I don’t know why, but that’s what happened.	Tsy fantatro ny antony, fa izany no nitranga.
She was pretty sure it would be tonight.	Tena azony antoka fa ho alina izao.
No, they asked.	Tsia, nangataka izy ireo.
I need to know what will happen next	Mila mahafantatra izay hitranga manaraka aho
I had never thought of that before	Tsy nieritreritra an'izany mihitsy aho taloha

And now he was learning.	Ary izao izy dia nianatra.
But maybe it’s because it’s not summer yet.	Fa angamba izany dia satria tsy mbola fahavaratra.

They shouldn’t talk about it.	Tsy tokony hiresaka momba izany izy ireo.
I was surprised he played.	Gaga aho fa nilalao izy.
I don't know him	Tsy fantatro izy
I'm not sure who	Tsy azoko antoka hoe iza
It was like his son.	Toy ny zanany ilay izy.
This is not good.	Tsy tsara izany.
Very close but very far.	Tena akaiky nefa lavitra be.
I wonder if he will talk to me	Manontany tena aho raha hiresaka amiko izy
I need to know these things	Mila mahafantatra ireo zavatra ireo aho
The above may not be there.	Mety tsy ho eo ny ambony.
Go and go.	Mandeha ary lasa.
Very well done.	Tena vita tsara.
I went to a small place	Nandeha tany amin'ny toerana kely aho
I made money and bought more land.	Nahazo vola aho ary nividy tany bebe kokoa.
I was about to drive when we talked	Saika hitondra fiara aho rehefa niresaka izahay
It could be something else.	Mety ho zavatra hafa izany.
This also seems true.	Toa marina koa izany.
I think he needs it	Heveriko fa mila izany izy
Good day.	Tsara ny andro.
I think he has been there a long time	Heveriko fa efa ela izy no tany
And that's how it should be.	Ary izany no tokony ho izy.
Such a thing is wrong.	Tsy mety ny zavatra toy izany.
We have been together for about two years.	Roa taona teo ho eo izahay no niaraka.
I always say that	Milaza izany foana aho
It’s just new, and there’s a lot that isn’t known.	Vaovao ihany io, ary be dia be ny tsy fantatra.
There are three of us.	Telo izahay.
This is something else.	Zavatra hafa ity.
But it didn’t happen.	Saingy tsy nisy izany.
Then something happened to me.	Dia nisy zavatra nitranga tamiko.
It is not such a thing.	Tsy zavatra toy izany izany.
I hope this helps someone.	Manantena aho fa hanampy olona iray ity.
I don’t like both ideas	Tsy tiako ny hevitra roa
They stay better when you both have them.	Mijanona tsara kokoa izy ireo rehefa samy manana ianao.
I knew it well because it was at home	Fantatro tsara izany satria tao an-trano izany
I’m going crazy, and it won’t help me	Lasa adala aho, ary tsy hanampy ahy izany
I didn’t even know it was possible	Tsy fantatro akory hoe azo atao izany
You know you can’t think of anything.	Fantatrao fa tsy afaka mieritreritra na inona na inona ianao.
Don't say such a thing to me again.	Aza manao teny toy izany amiko intsony.
I decided on the latter.	Nanapa-kevitra momba ity farany aho.
I’m not doing much this weekend	Tsy dia be loatra aho amin'ity faran'ny herinandro ity
So we need to think about what might happen first.	Noho izany dia mila mieritreritra ny mety hitranga aloha isika.
He is a very big man.	Tena lehilahy lehibe tokoa izy.
I thought hard.	Nieritreritra mafy aho.
This is the worst.	Io no ratsy indrindra.
I found the same thing in the book.	Hitako ny zavatra mitovy amin'ny boky.
We are still children.	Mbola zaza izahay.
He sat down to read it.	Nipetraka namaky izany izy.
And it seems to work.	Ary toa miasa izany.
Whether good or bad.	Na tsara na ratsy.
I went back home	Niverina nankany an-trano aho
Because it is so easy to make mistakes.	Satria tena mora ny manao fahadisoana.
I have never done anything wrong	Tsy nanao ratsy mihitsy aho
He worked, he worked.	Niasa izy, niasa izy.
I love him but not him	Tiako izy fa tsy izy
No one gave me a letter.	Tsy nisy nanome ahy taratasy.
And that seems to be true.	Ary toa marina izany.
He knew they wouldn’t.	Fantany fa tsy ho izy ireo.
And so we did it with a lot of players.	Ary noho izany dia nanao izany niaraka tamin'ny mpilalao maro izahay.
We can do better than that.	Afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izany isika.
I still get this error.	Mbola mahazo an'io fahadisoana io aho.
It was nice that someone was happy with me.	Nahafinaritra fa nisy olona faly tamiko.
I needed him and he needed me	Nila azy aho ary nila ahy izy
Certainly not going.	Azo antoka fa tsy mandeha.
He just wanted to see her.	Te hahita azy fotsiny izy.
It will not be done	Tsy ho vita izany
I'm not sure if he can	Tsy azoko antoka raha afaka izy
He could have made himself do it.	Afaka nanao ny tenany hanao izany izy.
I have to say that	Tsy maintsy nilaza izany aho
I think that’s really hard	Heveriko fa tena sarotra izany
To be or not to be.	Ny ho na ny tsy ho.
I knew it was going to be a big deal	Fantatro fa ho zavatra lehibe izany
I went.	Nandeha aho.
I learned that when I was a child.	Nianatra izany aho tamin’ny mbola kely.
I only saw it last week.	Vao tamin'ny herinandro aho no nahita an'io.
He left before he even got here.	Nandeha izy mbola tsy tonga teto akory.
I tried to leave but refused	Niezaka niala aho fa tsy nety
I don't need to tell you.	Tsy mila miteny aminao aho.
I don’t like it, but that’s what it is.	Tsy tiako izany, fa izany no izy.
He may have seen something, or heard something.	Mety nahita zavatra izy, na nandre zavatra.
Please, please.	Azafady azafady.
She is scared.	Matahotra izy.
I slept for a few hours	Natory adiny vitsivitsy aho
He sat there.	Nipetraka teo izy.
I would never say.	Tsy hilaza mihitsy aho.
It was up to me to talk to him.	Avy amiko ny niresaka taminy.
Two men, one woman.	Lehilahy roa, vehivavy iray.
I really don’t know what happened	Tena tsy haiko izay nitranga
Today was the worst.	Androany no ratsy indrindra.
I don’t want to be wrong about anything	Tsy te ho diso na inona na inona aho
You may have to leave as soon as possible.	Mety tsy maintsy miala haingana araka izay azo atao ianao.
It didn't happen	Tsy nitranga izany
There was too much hard work here.	Be loatra ny asa mafy teto.
And it's still there.	Ary mbola eo izany.
And that's how it should be.	Ary izany no tokony ho izy.
He was not there to teach them.	Tsy teo izy mba hianatra azy ireo.
I saw it come here	Hitako fa tonga teto
Tell me what you think.	Lazao ahy ny hevitrao.
But only if you like me.	Fa raha tianao ihany aho.
You two are happy.	Faly ianareo roa.
All is well.	Mandeha tsara ny zava-drehetra.
However, it needed to be done.	Na izany aza, nila nanao izany.
But not dead.	Fa tsy maty.
I told him he was crazy	Nolazaiko azy fa izy no adala
Too often it’s like that.	Matetika loatra ny toy izany.
I talked for over an hour	Niresaka adiny iray mahery aho
It’s a long way and you need a little time.	Lavitra be io ary mila fotoana kely ianao.
I know what happened	Fantatro ny zava-nitranga
You also drink too much.	Misotro be loatra koa ianao.
He waited a while.	Niandry kely izy.
Not how old.	Tsy hoe firy taona akory.
He was angry.	Tezitra izy.
I was not in the right place	Tsy teo amin'ny toerana mety aho
I'm not sure where it was	Tsy azoko antoka hoe taiza ilay izy
I got it this morning.	Nahazo izany aho androany maraina.
Please don't leave me.	Aza miala amiko azafady.
He could have done it easily.	Afaka nanao izany mora foana izy.
It just sat there.	Nipetraka teo fotsiny ilay izy.
It didn’t come.	Tsy tonga izany.
He is an honest man.	Lehilahy manao ny marina izy.
I will be alone.	Ho irery aho.

It’s something else.	Zavatra hafa izany.
I have planned to talk to you before	Efa nikasa hiresaka aminao aho teo aloha
They never leave you when you need help.	Tsy miala aminao mihitsy izy ireo rehefa mila fanampiana ianao.
Then I started reading it	Nanomboka namaky azy io aho avy eo
He will meet her again.	Mbola hihaona aminy indray izy.
I could have called him	Afaka niantso azy aho
He had to do something.	Tsy maintsy nanao zavatra izy.

I couldn't look at him	Tsy afaka nijery azy aho

I was so wrong about that	Tena diso aho tamin'izany
It’s hard, fun and crazy.	Mafy, mahafinaritra ary adala izany.
It’s still good today.	Mbola tsara izany ankehitriny.
We have come a long way.	Lasa lavitra be izahay.
I think he was just scared	Heveriko fa matahotra fotsiny izy
You just can’t.	Tsy azonao atao fotsiny.
Not sure how many.	Tsy azo antoka hoe firy.
Never had a problem.	Tsy nanana olana mihitsy.
They’re really nothing.	Tsy tena na inona na inona izy ireo.
It’s like no one knows.	Toy ny hoe tsy misy mahalala.
It doesn’t exist now.	Tsy misy izany ankehitriny.
Nothing will be lost in the end.	Tsy misy ho very amin'ity farany.
But that's not right.	Saingy tsy mety izany.
I will never talk to you	Tsy hiresaka aminao mihitsy aho
But you are the last.	Fa ianao no farany.
Perhaps, we began to wonder that it didn’t exist.	Angamba, nanomboka nanontany tena isika hoe tsy nisy izany.
He can do anything.	Afaka manao na inona na inona izy.
He was very good to the end.	Tena tsara izy hatramin'ny farany.

I wondered if he would say anything	Nanontany tena aho raha hilaza zavatra izy
There was too much wrong.	Be loatra ny tsy nety.

There really isn’t one.	Tsy misy marina na iray aza.
I was very interested in that	Tena liana tamin'izany aho
I had another question.	Nanana fanontaniana hafa aho.
I will be worse tomorrow	Ho ratsy kokoa aho rahampitso
I didn’t ask for it	Tsy nangataka an'izany aho
I'm still confused	Mbola very hevitra aho

I know about these things	Fantatro ny momba ireo zavatra ireo
I can't bring or comment	Tsy afaka mitondra na mitondra hevitra aho

There are no other words for him.	Tsy misy teny hafa ho azy.
It didn't seem like anything really happened in the last few hours.	Toa tsy tena nisy ny zava-nitranga tao anatin’ny ora vitsivitsy.
I want to learn about him	Te hianatra momba azy aho

It’s a real rare opportunity.	Tena fahafahana tsy dia misy loatra izany.
I’m usually not that angry	Matetika aho no tsy tezitra toy izany
That must be enough	Tsy maintsy ampy izany
Because he needed to be lost.	Satria nila ho very izy.
I'm not sure what the real reason is.	Tsy azoko antoka hoe inona no tena antony.
I tried him, he tried me	Nanandrana azy aho, nanandrana ahy izy
I am no longer a child	Tsy zaza intsony aho
He looked at everyone.	Nijery ny rehetra izy.
I guess we never asked.	Ataoko fa tsy nanontany mihitsy izahay.

I need to know that.	Mila mahafantatra izany aho.
I thought you said you were a good player	Nihevitra aho fa nilaza ianao fa mpilalao mahay
Right now he has no idea.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia tsy manana hevitra izy.
But more than that, or just something else.	Saingy mihoatra noho izany, na hafa fotsiny.
And thank you.	Ary misaotra.
He needed to talk.	Nila niresaka izy.
I never had a job	Tsy nanana asa mihitsy aho
But not yours.	Fa tsy ny anao.
I want it to be done well.	Tiako ho vita tsara izany.

No, women do that.	Tsia, manao izany ny vehivavy.
I tried to think	Niezaka nieritreritra aho
He was busy at first like all of us.	Sahirana izy tamin’ny voalohany toa antsika rehetra.
I don't need any accidents here.	Tsy mila loza eto aho.
I didn’t just sit around writing this book	Tsy nipetraka fotsiny aho nanoratra io boky io
It’s not even about that.	Tsy momba izany akory.
He looks away.	Mijery lavitra izy.
I wanted more than that	Naniry mihoatra noho izany aho
I'm busy now	Sahirana aho izao
That hasn't happened yet this year.	Mbola tsy tanteraka izany amin’ity taona ity.
I should have told him	Tokony ho nilaza taminy aho
I never heard anything about him again	Tsy nandre na inona na inona momba azy intsony aho
Thank you for bringing me.	Misaotra anao nitondra ahy.
I need to apologize to you	Mila miala tsiny aminao aho

You are very good.	Tena tsara ianao.

Do you.	Ianao ve.
I even had a different place	Nanana toerana hafa mihitsy aho

They are so much more than students.	Izy ireo dia mihoatra lavitra noho ny mpianatra.

Others stay outside.	Ny hafa mijanona any ivelany.
But no one was there.	Saingy tsy nisy olona tao.
I said no to others, I hoped	Nolazaiko fa tsia ny hafa, nanantena aho
I was happy about that.	Faly aho tamin’izany.
I went with him	Nandeha niaraka taminy aho
Yes, he is there.	Eny, any izy.
But there was everything in it.	Saingy nisy ny zava-drehetra tamin'izany.
This can be done as follows.	Izany dia azo atao toy izao manaraka izao.
I was able to sit in this room completely	Afaka nipetraka tao amin'ity efitrano ity tanteraka aho
I still study in the morning	Mbola mianatra ny maraina aho

Although that is not the problem.	Na dia tsy izany aza no olana.
I already told him that.	Efa nolazaiko azy izany.

It’s easier to draw a picture.	Mora kokoa ny manao sary iray.

I must have heard them at night	Tsy maintsy ho nandre azy ireo aho tamin'ny alina
He said the same thing.	Nilaza izany koa izy.

I didn't even think about it	Tsy nieritreritra an'izany akory aho
They looked at him quickly, and then left.	Nijery azy haingana izy ireo, ary avy eo dia lasa.
He must have fallen asleep.	Tsy maintsy renoky ny torimaso izy.
It just went away.	Lasa fotsiny ilay izy.
I immediately saw that he was angry	Hitako avy hatrany fa tezitra izy
And they stopped.	Dia nijanona izy ireo.
We now have two cars.	Manana fiara roa izahay izao.
I tried not to look.	Niezaka tsy nijery aho.
I was too scared to ask	Natahotra loatra aho nanontany
There is no opportunity to wait.	Tsy misy fahafahana miandry.

I want to live.	Te ho velona aho.
I'm happy to wait	Faly aho miandry
However, of course, that opportunity exists.	Na izany aza, mazava ho azy fa misy izany fahafahana izany.
And it happened to me too.	Ary nitranga tamiko koa izany.
So we sat in the house.	Dia nipetraka tao an-trano izahay.

I hope you	Manantena anao aho
Then someone else.	Avy eo dia olona iray hafa.
They felt right.	Nahatsiaro ho marina izy ireo.
That’s probably why.	Izany angamba no nahatonga azy.
People who have to work for them are not so lucky.	Ny olona tsy maintsy miasa ho azy ireo dia tsy dia tsara vintana.
I couldn't think of anything else	Tsy afaka nieritreritra zavatra hafa aho
Then they left.	Dia lasa izy ireo.

I don’t know this guy personally	Tsy fantatro manokana io lehilahy io

It makes good money.	Mahazo vola tsara izany.
He said he was busy.	Nilaza izy fa sahirana.
Then he left and never returned.	Dia lasa izy ary tsy niverina intsony.
There really was.	Tena nisy tokoa.

I played it	Nilalao azy io aho
And it’s not too bad.	Ary tsy dia ratsy loatra izany.
It doesn't seem to matter.	Toa tsy maninona izany.
I knew he was already here	Fantatro fa efa teto izy
I did, and the day seemed to be on us.	Nanao izany aho, ary toa teo aminay ihany ilay andro.
I know you understand these things	Fantatro fa azonao ireo zavatra ireo
He started playing himself.	Nanomboka nilalao ny tenany izy.
Evil is evil even when necessary.	Ny ratsy dia ratsy na dia ilaina aza.
Tell us why.	Lazao anay ny antony.
I’m really not a pretty person.	Tena tsy olona tsara tarehy aho.
Too bad.	Ratsy loatra.
I waited what seemed like years	Niandry izay toa taona maro aho
Don’t ask about it anymore.	Aza manontany momba izany intsony.
And then maybe something else.	Ary mety ho hafa indray avy eo.
Do not believe.	Aza mino.
I’m pretty sure of that.	Tena azoko antoka izany.
It had to help.	Tsy maintsy nanampy izany.
I will do all this	Izaho no hanao izany rehetra izany

I still want to be with him.	Mbola te hiaraka aminy aho.
I didn’t think he had it in him	Tsy noheveriko fa nanana izany tao aminy izy
There will be pictures coming soon.	Hisy sary ho avy tsy ho ela.
I should have been with you	Tokony niaraka taminao aho
I think it could have been a better thing.	Heveriko fa mety ho zavatra tsara kokoa izany.
I can't read anything	Tsy afaka mamaky na inona na inona aho
A new path took him on a new journey	Lalana vaovao nitondra azy tamin'ny dia vaovao
However, two years ago.	Na izany aza, roa taona lasa izay.
What's that.	Inona izany.
He was a little free.	Somary afaka ihany izy.
It would be bad.	Ho ratsy izany.
I would have done anything for him.	Ho nanao na inona na inona ho azy aho.
I’m glad that others are doing the same	Faly aho fa manao toy izany koa ny hafa
I will get there.	Ho tonga any aho.
I almost exist	Saika mba misy aho
Now he had a chance to think.	Ankehitriny dia nanana fahafahana nieritreritra izy.
It's been a long time.	Efa ela izay.
He said it could happen this year as well.	Nilaza izy fa mety hitranga amin'ity taona ity ihany koa.
It came back to me like an old friend.	Niverina tamiko toy ny namana taloha.
I was so scared he was dead	Natahotra mafy aho fa maty izy
I believe he doesn’t care	Mino aho fa tsy miraharaha izy

At first you can still eat.	Amin'ny voalohany dia mbola afaka mihinana ianao.
But and not something.	Fa ary tsy zavatra.
They have to be fast.	Tsy maintsy haingana izy ireo.
I knew he had to be there	Fantatro fa tsy maintsy teo izy
I don’t care, I really don’t care.	Izaho tsy miraharaha aho, tena tsy miraharaha aho.
I always knew exactly where he was	Fantatro tsara foana ny toerana nisy azy
Not talking about it recently.	Tsy miresaka momba izany vao haingana.
I need more help and you can help me	Mila fanampiana bebe kokoa aho ary afaka manampy ahy ianao
I am very happy about that.	Tena faly aho noho izany.
I wonder about that.	Manontany tena aho momba izany.
I also began to study	Nanomboka nianatra koa aho
He could not be here.	Tsy afaka teto izy.
I thought bad news	Nieritreritra vaovao ratsy aho
I have an idea.	Manana hevitra aho.
You seem to be really together.	Toa tena miaraka ianareo.
But only today and today.	Fa anio sy anio ihany.
I worked really hard.	Niasa mafy dia mafy aho.
I called him, wondering who it was	Niantso azy aho, nanontany tena hoe iza io
I know what they are	Fantatro hoe inona izy ireo
I hoped he knew that everyone here really loved him	Nanantena aho fa fantany fa tena tia azy ny olona rehetra eto
He did not know the way.	Tsy fantany ny lalana.
I think a lot of people read it	Heveriko fa maro ny olona mamaky azy io
He talked to me about it this morning.	Niresaka tamiko momba izany izy androany maraina.
Yes, it happened again.	Eny, nitranga indray izany.
He loved living here.	Tiany ny nipetraka teto.
And that's true.	Ary marina izany.

I need to talk to him	Mila miresaka aminy aho
I don’t even have to say that	Tsy voatery nilaza izany akory aho

I have long wanted	Efa ela aho no naniry
We thought we might be ready as well.	Nihevitra izahay fa mety ho vonona ihany koa.
I watched go.	Nijery aho nandeha.
This man is sick of me.	Marary ahy ity lehilahy ity.
We talked.	Niresaka izahay.
I'm not.	Tsy izany aho.
She should love her children.	Tokony ho tia ny zanany izy.
If he wasn’t there, he had a problem.	Raha tsy teo izy dia nanana olana izy.
I really wanted something	Naniry mafy zavatra aho
I really like this one	Tena tiako ity iray ity
And we were both very happy.	Ary faly be izahay roa.
So even when people make mistakes, we love them.	Ka na dia manao fahadisoana aza ny olona dia tia azy isika.
It helped a little.	Nanampy kely izany.
It certainly might.	Azo antoka fa mety hanao izany.

I always ask if there is anything else to do	Manontany foana aho raha misy zavatra hafa atao
We can buy anything you want.	Afaka mividy izay rehetra tianao izahay.
But there is no time.	Saingy tsy misy fotoana.
He became completely insane.	Lasa adala tanteraka izy.
It is easier to follow this method.	Mora kokoa ny manaraka izany fomba izany.
I would never have seen him without him	Tsy nahita azy mihitsy aho raha tsy teo

I hope you like them	Manantena aho fa tianao izy ireo

I need to talk to him and make sure	Mila miresaka aminy aho ary mahazo antoka
I can’t believe you did something like this to me	Tsy mino aho fa nanao zavatra toy izao tamiko ianao
He was a man, in fact, a strong man.	Lehilahy izy, raha ny marina, dia lehilahy mahery.
I’m so glad we did.	Tena faly aho fa nanao izany izahay.
Maybe that’s what you’ll find in it, maybe not.	Angamba izany no hahita azy amin'izany, angamba tsy izany.

I need water.	Mila rano aho.
For now, that is enough.	Amin'izao fotoana izao dia ampy izay.

I hope to see him again soon	Manantena ny hahita azy indray aho tsy ho ela

Here I am.	Eto amiko.
He will do all he can for her.	Hanao izay rehetra azony atao ho azy izy.
